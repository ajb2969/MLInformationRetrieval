Convenient vector space

In mathematics, convenient vector spaces are locally convex vector spaces satisfying a very mild completeness condition.
Traditional differential calculus is effective in the analysis of finite-dimensional vector spaces and for Banach spaces. Beyond Banach spaces, difficulties begin to arise; in particular, composition of continuous linear mappings stop being jointly continuous at the level of Banach spaces,
 
 
 
  for any compatible topology on the spaces of continuous linear mappings.
Mappings between convenient vector spaces are smooth or 
 
 
 
  if they map smooth curves to smooth curves. This leads to a Cartesian closed category of smooth mappings between 
 
 
 
 -open subsets of convenient vector spaces (see property 6 below). The corresponding calculus of smooth mappings is called convenient calculus. It is weaker than any other reasonable notion of differentiability, it is easy to apply, but there are smooth mappings which are not continuous (see Note 1). This type of calculus alone is not useful in solving equations.
The 
 
 
 
 -topology
Let 
 
 
 
  be a locally convex vector space. A curve 
 
 
 
  is called smooth or 
 
 
 
  if all derivatives exist and are continuous. Let 
 
 
 
  be the space of smooth curves. It can be shown that the set of smooth curves does not depend entirely on the locally convex topology of E, only on its associated bornology (system of bounded sets); see [KM], 2.11. The final topologies with respect to the following sets of mappings into 
 
 
 
  coincide; see [KM], 2.13.



 
 .
The set of all Lipschitz curves (so that } is bounded in 
 
 
 
 , for each 
 
 
 
 ).
The set of injections 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  runs through all bounded absolutely convex subsets in 
 
 
 
 , and where 
 
 
 
  is the linear span of 
 
 
 
  equipped with the Minkowski functional x{{!!}} :
 
 
 
  inf {λ > 0 :x ∈ λ B} }}.
The set of all Mackey-convergent sequences 
 
 
 
  (there exists a sequence 
 
 


This topology is called the 
 
 
 
 -topology on 
 
 
 
  and we write 
 
 
 
  for the resulting topological space. In general (on the space 
 
 
 
  of smooth functions with compact support on the real line, for example) it is finer than the given locally convex topology, it is not a vector space topology, since addition is no longer jointly continuous. Namely, even 
 
 
 
 . The finest among all locally convex topologies on 
 
 
 
  which are coarser than 
 
 
 
  is the bornologification of the given locally convex topology. If 
 
 
 
  is a Fréchet space, then 
 
 
 
 .
Convenient vector spaces
A locally convex vector space 
 
 
 
  is said to be a convenient vector space if one of the following equivalent conditions holds (called 
 
 
 
 -completeness); see [KM], 2.14.

For any 
 
 
 
  the (Riemann-) integral 
 
 
 
  exists in 
 
 
 
 .
Any Lipschitz curve in 
 
 
 
  is locally Riemann integrable.
Any scalar wise

 
  curve is 
 
 
 
 : A curve 
 
 
 
  is smooth if and only if the composition 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the dual of all continuous linear functionals on 
 
 
 
 .
 
Equivalently, for all 
 
 
 
 , the dual of all bounded linear functionals.
Equivalently, for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a subset of 
 
 
 
  which recognizes bounded subsets in 
 
 
 
 .

Any Mackey-Cauchy-sequence (i. e., 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 ) converges in 
 
 
 
 . This is visibly a mild completeness requirement.
If 
 
 
 
  is bounded closed absolutely convex, then 
 
 
 
  is a Banach space.
If 
 
 
 
  is scalar wise 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is scalarwise 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is differentiable at 0.

Here a mapping 
 
 
 
  is called 
 
 
 
  if all derivatives up to order 
 
 
 
  exist and are Lipschitz, locally on 
 
 
 
 .
Smooth mappings
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be convenient vector spaces, and let 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
 -open. A mapping 
 
 
 
  is called smooth or 
 
 
 
 , if the composition 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . See[KM], 3.11.
Main properties of smooth calculus
1. For maps on Fréchet spaces this notion of smoothness coincides with all other reasonable definitions. On 
 
 
 
  this is a non-trivial theorem, proved by Boman, 1967. See also [KM], 3.4.
2. Multilinear mappings are smooth if and only if they are bounded ([KM], 5.5).
3. If 
 
 
 
  is smooth then the derivative 
 
 
 
  is smooth, and also 
 
 
 
  is smooth where 
 
 
 
  denotes the space of all bounded linear mappings with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded subsets; see [KM], 3.18.
4. The chain rule holds ([KM], 3.18).
5. The space 
 
 
 
  of all smooth mappings 
 
 
 
  is again a convenient vector space where the structure is given by the following injection, where 
 
 
 
  carries the topology of compact convergence in each derivative separately; see [KM], 3.11 and 3.7.






C^\infty(U,F) \to \prod_{c\in C^\infty(\mathbb R,U), \ell\in F^*} C^\infty(\mathbb R,\mathbb R), \quad f\mapsto (\ell\circ f\circ c)_{c,\ell}\,. 
6. The exponential law holds ([KM], 3.12): For 
 
 
 
 -open 
 
 
 
  the following mapping is a linear diffeomorphism of convenient vector spaces.






C^\infty(U,C^\infty(V,G)) \cong C^\infty(U\times V, G),\qquad f \mapsto g,\qquad f(u)(v) = g(u,v).  This is the main assumption of variational calculus. Here it is a theorem. This property is the source of the name convenient, which was borrowed from (Steenrod 1967).
7. Smooth uniform boundedness theorem ([KM], theorem 5.26). A linear mapping 
 
 
 
  is smooth (by (2) equivalent to bounded) if and only if 
 
 
 
  is smooth for each 
 
 
 
 .
8. The following canonical mappings are smooth. This follows from the exponential law by simple categorical reasonings, see [KM], 3.13.






\begin{align} & \operatorname{ev}: C^\infty(E,F)\times E\to F,\quad \text{ev}(f,x) = f(x) \\[6pt] & \operatorname{ins}: E\to C^\infty(F,E\times F),\quad\text{ins}(x)(y) = (x,y) \\[6pt] & (\quad)^\wedge :C^\infty(E,C^\infty(F,G))\to C^\infty(E\times F,G) \\[6pt] & (\quad)^\vee :C^\infty(E\times F,G)\to C^\infty(E,C^\infty(F,G)) \\[6pt] & \operatorname{comp}:C^\infty(F,G)\times C^\infty(E,F)\to C^\infty(E,G) \\[6pt] & C^\infty(\quad,\quad):C^\infty(F,F_1)\times C^\infty(E_1,E)\to C^\infty(C^\infty(E,F),C^\infty(E_1,F_1)),\quad (f,g)\mapsto(h\mapsto f\circ h\circ g) \\ [6pt] & \prod:\prod C^\infty(E_i,F_i)\to C^\infty \left(\prod E_i,\prod F_i\right) \end{align} 
Related convenient calculi
Convenient calculus of smooth mappings appeared for the first time in [Frölicher, 1981], [Kriegl 1982, 1983]. Convenient calculus (having properties 6 and 7) exists also for:

Real analytic mappings (Kriegl, Michor ,1990; see also [KM], chapter II).
Holomorphic mappings (Kriegl, Nel, 1985; see also [KM], chapter II). The notion of holomorphy is that of [Fantappié, 1930-33].
Many classes of Denjoy Carleman ultradifferentiable functions, both of Beurling type and of Roumieu-type [Kriegl, Michor , Rainer, 2009, 2011, 2015].
With some adaptations, 
 
 
 
 , [FK].
With more adaptations, even 
 
 
 
  (i.e., the 
 
 
 
 -th derivative is Hölder-continuous with index α) ([Faure, 1989], [Faure, These Geneve, 1991]).

The corresponding notion of convenient vector space is the same (for their underlying real vector space in the complex case) for all these theories.
Application: Manifolds of mappings between finite dimensional manifolds
The exponential law 6 of convenient calculus allows for very simple proofs of the basic facts about manifolds of mappings. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be finite dimensional smooth manifolds where 
 
 
 
  is compact. We use an auxiliary Riemann metric

 
  on 
 
 
 
 . The Riemannian exponential mapping of 
 
 
 
  is described in the following diagram:

It induces an atlas of charts on the space 
 
 
 
  of all smooth mappings 
 
 
 
  as follows. A chart centered at 
 
 
 
 , is:














Now the basics facts follow in easily. Trivializing the pull back vector bundle 
 
 
 
  and applying the exponential law 6 leads to the diffeomorphism








All chart change mappings are smooth (
 
 
 
 ) since they map smooth curves to smooth curves:








Thus 
 
 
 
  is a smooth manifold modelled on Fréchet spaces. The space of all smooth curves in this manifold is given by








Since it visibly maps smooth curves to smooth curves, composition








is smooth. As a consequence of the chart structure, the tangent bundle of the manifold of mappings is given by








Regular Lie groups
Let 
 
 
 
  be a connected smooth Lie group modeled on convenient vector spaces, with Lie algebra 
 
 
 
 . Multiplication and inversion are denoted by:








The notion of a regular Lie group is originally due to Omori et al. for Fréchet Lie groups, was weakened and made more transparent by J.Milnor, and was then carried over to convenient Lie groups; see [KM], 38.4.
A Lie group 
 
 
 
  is called regular if the following two conditions hold:

For each smooth curve 
 
 
 
  in the Lie algebra there exists a smooth curve 
 
 
 
  in the Lie group whose right logarithmic derivative is 
 
 
 
 . It turn out that 
 
 
 
  is uniquely determined by its initial value 
 
 
 
 , if it exists. That is,









If 
 
 
 
  is the unique solution for the curve 
 
 
 
  required above, we denote









The following mapping is required to be smooth:









If 
 
 
 
  is a constant curve in the Lie algebra, then 
 
 
 
  is the group exponential mapping.
Theorem. For each compact manifold 
 
 
 
 , the diffeomorphism group 
 
 
 
  is a regular Lie group. Its Lie algebra is the space 
 
 
 
  of all smooth vector fields on 
 
 
 
 , with the negative of the usual bracket as Lie bracket.
Proof: The diffeomorphism group 
 
 
 
  is a smooth manifold since it is an open subset in 
 
 
 
 . Composition is smooth by restriction. Inversion is smooth: If 
 
 
 
  is a smooth curve in 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  satisfies the implicit equation 
 
 
 
 , so by the finite dimensional implicit function theorem, 
 
 
 
  is smooth. So inversion maps smooth curves to smooth curves, and thus inversion is smooth. Let 
 
 
 
  be a time dependent vector field on 
 
 
 
  (in 
 
 
 
 ). Then the flow operator 
 
 
 
  of the corresponding autonomous vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  induces the evolution operator via








which satisfies the ordinary differential equation








Given a smooth curve in the Lie algebra, 
 
 
 
 , then the solution of the ordinary differential equation depends smoothly also on the further variable 
 
 
 
 , thus 
 
 
 
  maps smooth curves of time dependent vector fields to smooth curves of diffeomorphism. QED.
The principal bundle of embeddings
For finite dimensional manifolds 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  compact, the space 
 
 
 
  of all smooth embeddings of 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 , is open in 
 
 
 
 , so it is a smooth manifold. The diffeomorphism group 
 
 
 
  acts freely and smoothly from the right on 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem:

 
  is a principal fiber bundle with structure group 
 
 
 
 .
Proof: One uses again an auxiliary Riemannian metric 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . Given 
 
 
 
 , view 
 
 
 
  as a submanifold of 
 
 
 
 , and split the restriction of the tangent bundle 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  into the subbundle normal to 
 
 
 
  and tangential to 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . Choose a tubular neighborhood








If 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -near to $f$, then






g\circ\, \phi(g)^{-1}\in \Gamma(f^*W_{f(M)}) \subset \Gamma(f^*\operatorname{Nor}(f(M))). This is the required local splitting. QED
