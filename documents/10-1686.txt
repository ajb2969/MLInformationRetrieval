Phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase




Phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase

In enzymology, a phosphoacetylglucosamine mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate, and one product, N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the phosphotransferases (phosphomutases), which transfer phosphate groups within a molecule. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1,6-phosphomutase. Other names in common use include acetylglucosamine phosphomutase, acetylglucosamine phosphomutase, acetylaminodeoxyglucose phosphomutase, phospho-N-acetylglucosamine mutase, and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 1,6-phosphomutase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism. This enzyme has at least one effector, N-Acetyl-D-glucosamine 1,6-bisphosphate.
