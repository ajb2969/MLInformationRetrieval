   Affine-regular polygon      Affine-regular polygon   In geometry , an affine-regular polygon or affinely regular polygon is a polygon that is related to a regular polygon by an affine transformation . Affine transformations include translations , uniform and non-uniform scaling , reflections , rotations , shears , and other similarities and some, but not all linear maps .  All triangles are affine-regular. In other words, all triangles can be generated by applying affine transformations to an equilateral triangle . A quadrilateral is affine-regular if and only if it is a parallelogram , which includes rectangles and rhombuses as well as squares . In fact, affine-regular polygons may be considered a natural generalization of parallelograms. 1  Many properties of regular polygons are invariant under affine transformations, and affine-regular polygons share the same properties. For instance, an affine-regular quadrilateral can be equidissected into   m   m   m   equal-area triangles if and only if   m   m   m   is even, by affine invariance of equidissection and Monsky's theorem on equidissections of squares. 2 More generally an   n   n   n   -gon with    n  >  4      n  4    n>4   may be equidissected into   m   m   m   equal-area triangles if and only if   m   m   m   is a multiple of   n   n   n   . 3  References  "  Category:Affine geometry  Category:Polygons     .
