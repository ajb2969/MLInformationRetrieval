   Hensel's lemma      Hensel's lemma   In mathematics , Hensel's lemma , also known as Hensel's lifting lemma , named after Kurt Hensel , is a result in modular arithmetic , stating that if a polynomial equation has a simple root modulo a prime number    p   p   p   , then this root corresponds to a unique root of the same equation modulo any higher power of   p   p   p   , which can be found by iteratively " lifting " the solution modulo successive powers of   p   p   p   . More generally it is used as a generic name for analogues for complete  commutative rings (including p -adic fields in particular) of the Newton method for solving equations. Since p -adic analysis is in some ways simpler than real analysis , there are relatively neat criteria guaranteeing a root of a polynomial.  Statement  Let    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   be a polynomial with integer (or p -adic integer) coefficients, and let m , k be positive integers such that m ≤ k . If r is an integer such that       f   (  r  )    ≡   0     (   mod   p  k    )          f  r    annotated  0   pmod   superscript  p  k       f(r)\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{k})   and      f  ′    (  r  )    ≢   0     (   mod  p   )       not-equivalent-to     superscript  f  normal-′   r    annotated  0   pmod  p      f^{\prime}(r)\not\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     then there exists an integer s such that       f   (  s  )    ≡   0     (   mod   p   k  +  m     )          f  s    annotated  0   pmod   superscript  p    k  m        f(s)\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{k+m})   and     r  ≡   s     (   mod   p  k    )     .      r   annotated  s   pmod   superscript  p  k       r\equiv s\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{k}).     Furthermore, this s is unique modulo p k +m , and can be computed explicitly as      s  =   r  +   t   p  k         s    r    t   superscript  p  k       s=r+tp^{k}   where     t  =   -     f   (  r  )     p  k    ⋅   (    f  ′     (  r  )    -  1     )      .      t     normal-⋅      f  r    superscript  p  k       superscript  f  normal-′    superscript  r    1         t=-\frac{f(r)}{p^{k}}\cdot(f^{\prime}(r)^{-1}).     In this formula for t , the division by p k denotes ordinary integer division (where the remainder will be 0), while negation, multiplication, and multiplicative inversion     f  ′     (  r  )    -  1         superscript  f  normal-′    superscript  r    1      f^{\prime}(r)^{-1}   are performed in     ℤ  /   p  m    ℤ        ℤ   superscript  p  m    ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\mathbb{Z}   .  As an aside, if      f  ′    (  r  )    ≡   0     (   mod  p   )           superscript  f  normal-′   r    annotated  0   pmod  p      f^{\prime}(r)\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   , then 0, 1, or several s may exist (see Hensel Lifting below).  Derivation  The lemma derives from considering the Taylor expansion of f around r . From    r  ≡   s     (   mod   p  k    )        r   annotated  s   pmod   superscript  p  k       r\equiv s\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{k})   , we see that s has to be of the form s = r + tp k for some integer t . Expanding    f   (   r  +   t   p  k     )       f    r    t   superscript  p  k       f(r+tp^{k})   gives        f   (   r  +   t   p  k     )    =    f   (  r  )    +     t   p  k    ⋅   f  ′     (  r  )    +   O   (   p   2  k    )      .        f    r    t   superscript  p  k          f  r      normal-⋅    t   superscript  p  k     superscript  f  normal-′    r     O   superscript  p    2  k        f(r+tp^{k})=f(r)+tp^{k}\cdot f^{\prime}(r)+O(p^{2k}).     Reducing both sides modulo p k+m , we see that for     f   (  s  )    ≡   0     (   mod   p   k  +  m     )          f  s    annotated  0   pmod   superscript  p    k  m        f(s)\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{k+m})   to hold, we need      0  ≡   f   (   r  +   t   p  k     )    ≡     f   (  r  )    +     t   p  k    ⋅   f  ′     (  r  )        (   mod   p   k  +  m     )          0    f    r    t   superscript  p  k            annotated      f  r      normal-⋅    t   superscript  p  k     superscript  f  normal-′    r     pmod   superscript  p    k  m         0\equiv f(r+tp^{k})\equiv f(r)+tp^{k}\cdot f^{\prime}(r)\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}%
 }p^{k+m})     where the O ( p 2 k ) terms vanish because k + m ≤ 2 k . Then we note that     f   (  r  )    =   z   p  k          f  r     z   superscript  p  k      f(r)=zp^{k}   for some integer z since r is a root of f mod p k , so      0  ≡     (   z  +   t   f  ′    (  r  )     )    p  k       (   mod   p   k  +  m     )        0   annotated      z    t   superscript  f  normal-′   r     superscript  p  k     pmod   superscript  p    k  m        0\equiv(z+tf^{\prime}(r))p^{k}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{k+m})   , which is to say       0  ≡    z  +   t   f  ′    (  r  )        (   mod   p  m    )     .      0   annotated    z    t   superscript  f  normal-′   r     pmod   superscript  p  m       0\equiv z+tf^{\prime}(r)\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{m}).     Then substituting back f ( r )/ p k for z and solving for t in     ℤ  /   p  m    ℤ        ℤ   superscript  p  m    ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/p^{m}\mathbb{Z}   gives the explicit formula for t mentioned above. The assumption that     f  ′    (  r  )        superscript  f  normal-′   r    f^{\prime}(r)   is not divisible by p ensures that     f  ′    (  r  )        superscript  f  normal-′   r    f^{\prime}(r)   has an inverse mod    p  m     superscript  p  m    p^{m}   which is necessarily unique. Hence a solution for t exists uniquely modulo    p  m     superscript  p  m    p^{m}   , and s exists uniquely modulo    p   k  +  m      superscript  p    k  m     p^{k+m}   .  Hensel Lifting  Using the lemma, one can "lift" (i.e. add multiples of the next power of p) a root r of the polynomial f mod p k to a new root s mod p k +1 such that r ≡ s mod p k (by taking m =1; taking larger m follows by induction). In fact, a root mod p k +1 is also a root mod p k , so the roots mod p k +1 are precisely the liftings of roots mod p k . The new root s is congruent to r mod p , so the new root also satisfies      f  ′    (  s  )    ≡    f  ′    (  r  )    ≢   0     (   mod  p   )             superscript  f  normal-′   s      superscript  f  normal-′   r     not-equivalent-to     annotated  0   pmod  p       f^{\prime}(s)\equiv f^{\prime}(r)\not\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   . So the lifting can be repeated, and starting from a solution r k of     f   (  x  )    ≡   0     (   mod   p  k    )          f  x    annotated  0   pmod   superscript  p  k       f(x)\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{k})   we can derive a sequence of solutions r k +1 , r k +2 , ... of the same congruence for successively higher powers of p , provided      f  ′    (   r  k   )    ≢   0     (   mod  p   )       not-equivalent-to     superscript  f  normal-′    subscript  r  k     annotated  0   pmod  p      f^{\prime}(r_{k})\not\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   for the initial root r k . This also shows that f has the same number of roots mod p k as mod p k +1 , mod p  k +2 , or any other higher power of p , provided the roots of f mod p k are all simple.  What happens to this process if r is not a simple root mod p ? If we have a root mod p k at which the derivative mod p is 0, then there is not a unique lifting of a root mod p k to a root mod p k +1 : either there is no lifting to a root mod p k +1 or there are multiple choices:    if     f   (  r  )    ≡    0   mod   p  k          f  r    modulo  0   superscript  p  k      f(r)\equiv 0\,\bmod{p^{k}}   and       f  ′    (  r  )    ≡    0   mod  p    ,         superscript  f  normal-′   r    modulo  0  p     f^{\prime}(r)\equiv 0\,\bmod{p},   then    s  ≡    r   mod   p  k    ⇒   f   (  s  )    ≡    f   (  r  )    mod   p   k  +  1           s   modulo  r   superscript  p  k      normal-⇒      f  s         modulo    f  r    superscript  p    k  1        s\equiv r\,\bmod p^{k}\Rightarrow f(s)\equiv f(r)\,\bmod p^{k+1}   .     That is,     f   (   r  +   t   p  k     )    ≡    0   mod    p   k  +  1            f    r    t   superscript  p  k       modulo  0   superscript  p    k  1       f(r+tp^{k})\equiv 0\,\bmod{p^{k+1}}\,   for all integers t . Therefore if      f   (  r  )    ≢    0   mod   p   k  +  1      ,     not-equivalent-to    f  r    modulo  0   superscript  p    k  1       f(r)\not\equiv 0\,\bmod{p^{k+1}},   then there is no lifting of r to a root of f ( x ) mod p k +1 , while if      f   (  r  )    ≡    0   mod   p   k  +  1      ,        f  r    modulo  0   superscript  p    k  1       f(r)\equiv 0\,\bmod{p^{k+1}},   then every lifting of r to modulus p k +1 is a root of f ( x ) mod p k +1 .  To see the difficulty that can arise in concrete examples, take p = 2, f ( x ) = x 2 + 1, and r = 1. Then f (1) ≡ 0 mod 2 and f'(1) ≡ 0 mod 2. We have f (1) = 2 ≠ 0 mod 4 which means that no lifting of 1 to modulus 4 is a root of f ( x ) mod 4.  On the other hand, if we take f ( x ) = x 2 − 17 then, as before, 1 is a root of f ( x ) mod 2 and the derivative is 0 mod 2. But since f (1) is 0 mod 4, then we can lift our solution to modulo 4 and both 1 and 3 are solutions. The derivative is still 0 mod 2, so a priori we don't know whether we can lift them to modulo 8, but in fact we can, since f (1) is 0 mod 8 and f (3) is 0 mod 8, giving solutions at 1, 3, 5, and 7 mod 8. Since of these only f (1) and f (7) are 0 mod 16 we can lift only 1 and 7 to modulo 16, giving 1, 7, 9, and 15 mod 16. Of these, only 7 and 9 give f ( x )=0 mod 32, so these can be raised giving 7, 9, 23, and 25 mod 32. It turns out that (for this example f(x)) for every positive integer k there are four liftings of 1 mod 2 to a root of f ( x ) mod 2 k .  Hensel's Lemma for p -adic Numbers  In the p -adic numbers, where we can make sense of rational numbers modulo powers of p as long as the denominator is not a multiple of p , the recursion from r k (roots mod p k ) to r k +1 (roots mod p k +1 ) can be expressed in a much more intuitive way. Instead of choosing t to be an(y) integer which solves the congruence     t   f  ′    (   r  k   )    ≡    -   (    f   (   r  k   )    /   p  k    )    mod    p  m           t   superscript  f  normal-′    subscript  r  k     modulo        f   subscript  r  k     superscript  p  k      superscript  p  m      tf^{\prime}(r_{k})\equiv-(f(r_{k})/p^{k})\,\bmod{p^{m}}\,   , let t be the rational number    -     (    f   (   r  k   )    /   p  k    )   /   f  ′     (   r  k   )                f   subscript  r  k     superscript  p  k     superscript  f  normal-′     subscript  r  k      \ -(f(r_{k})/p^{k})/f^{\prime}(r_{k})   (the p k here is not really a denominator since f ( r k ) is divisible by p k ). Then set          r   k  +  1    =    r  k   +   t   p  k     =    r  k   -    f   (   r  k   )      f  ′    (   r  k   )       .         subscript  r    k  1       subscript  r  k     t   superscript  p  k             subscript  r  k       f   subscript  r  k       superscript  f  normal-′    subscript  r  k         r_{k+1}=r_{k}+tp^{k}=r_{k}-\frac{f(r_{k})}{f^{\prime}(r_{k})}.        This fraction may not be an integer, but it is a p -adic integer, and the sequence of numbers r k converges in the p -adic integers to a root of f ( x ) = 0. Moreover, the displayed recursive formula for the (new) number r k +1 in terms of r k is precisely Newton's method for finding roots to equations in the real numbers.  By working directly in the p -adics and using the p -adic absolute value, there is a version of Hensel's lemma which can be applied even if we start with a solution of f ( a ) ≡ 0 mod p such that f'( a ) ≡ 0 mod p . We just need to make sure the number f'( a ) is not exactly 0. This more general version is as follows: if there is an integer a which satisfies | f ( a )| p  p 2 , then there is a unique p -adic integer b such f ( b ) = 0 and | b - a | p  p . The construction of b amounts to showing that the recursion from Newton's method with initial value a converges in the p -adics and we let b be the limit. The uniqueness of b as a root fitting the condition | b - a | p  p needs additional work.  The statement of Hensel's lemma given above (taking    m  =  1      m  1    m=1   ) is a special case of this more general version, since the conditions that f ( a ) ≡ 0 mod p and f'( a ) ≠ 0 mod p say that | f ( a )| p  p = 1.  Examples  Suppose that p is an odd prime number and a is a quadratic residue modulo p that is nonzero mod p . Then Hensel's lemma implies that a has a square root in the ring of p -adic integers Z p . Indeed, let f ( x )= x 2 - a . Its derivative is 2 x , so if r is a square root of a mod p we have       f   (  r  )    =    r  2   -  a   ≡    0   mod  p           f  r      superscript  r  2   a         modulo  0  p      f(r)=r^{2}-a\equiv 0\,\bmod{p}   and      f  ′    (  r  )    =   2  r   ≢    0   mod  p            superscript  f  normal-′   r     2  r     not-equivalent-to     modulo  0  p      f^{\prime}(r)=2r\not\equiv 0\,\bmod{p}   ,  where the second condition depends on p not being 2. The basic version of Hensel's lemma tells us that starting from r 1 = r we can recursively construct a sequence of integers { r k } such that         r   k  +  1    ≡     r  k    mod   p  k     ,    r  k  2   ≡    a   mod   p  k      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  r    k  1     modulo   subscript  r  k    superscript  p  k        superscript   subscript  r  k   2    modulo  a   superscript  p  k       r_{k+1}\equiv r_{k}\,\bmod{p^{k}},\quad r_{k}^{2}\equiv a\,\bmod{p^{k}}.     This sequence converges to some p -adic integer b and b 2 = a . In fact, b is the unique square root of a in Z p congruent to r 1 modulo p . Conversely, if a is a perfect square in Z p and it is not divisible by p then it is a nonzero quadratic residue mod p . Note that the quadratic reciprocity law allows one to easily test whether a is a nonzero quadratic residue mod p , thus we get a practical way to determine which p -adic numbers (for p odd) have a p -adic square root, and it can be extended to cover the case p =2 using the more general version of Hensel's lemma (an example with 2-adic square roots of 17 is given later).  To make the discussion above more explicit, let us find a "square root of 2" (the solution to      x  2   -  2   =  0         superscript  x  2   2   0    x^{2}-2=0   ) in the 7-adic integers. Modulo 7 one solution is 3 (we could also take 4), so we set     r  1   =  3       subscript  r  1   3    r_{1}=3   . Hensel's lemma then allows us to find    r  2     subscript  r  2    r_{2}   as follows:       f   (   r  1   )    =    3  2   -  2   =  7          f   subscript  r  1       superscript  3  2   2        7     f(r_{1})=3^{2}-2=7           f   (   r  1   )    /   p  1    =   7  /  7   =  1            f   subscript  r  1     superscript  p  1      7  7        1     f(r_{1})/p^{1}=7/7=1           f  ′    (   r  1   )    =   2   r  1    =  6           superscript  f  normal-′    subscript  r  1      2   subscript  r  1         6     f^{\prime}(r_{1})=2r_{1}=6           t   f  ′    (   r  1   )    ≡    -   (    f   (   r  1   )    /   p   k  -  1     )    mod  p    ,        t   superscript  f  normal-′    subscript  r  1     modulo        f   subscript  r  1     superscript  p    k  1      p     tf^{\prime}(r_{1})\equiv-(f(r_{1})/p^{k-1})\,\bmod{p},   that is,     t  ⋅  6   ≡    -   1    mod  7        normal-⋅  t  6    modulo    1   7     t\cdot 6\equiv-1\,\bmod{7}          ⇒  t  =  1       normal-⇒  absent  t       1     \Rightarrow t=1           r  2   =    r  1   +   t   p  1     =   3  +   1  ⋅  7    =  10  =   13  7    .         subscript  r  2      subscript  r  1     t   superscript  p  1            3   normal-⋅  1  7         10        subscript  13  7      r_{2}=r_{1}+tp^{1}=3+1\cdot 7=10=13_{7}.     And sure enough,     10  2   ≡    2   mod   7  2         superscript  10  2    modulo  2   superscript  7  2      10^{2}\equiv 2\,\bmod{7^{2}}   . (If we had used the Newton method recursion directly in the 7-adics, then r 2 = r 1 - f( r 1 )/f'( r 1 ) = 3 - 7/6 = 11/6, and 11/6 ≡ 10 mod 7 2 .)  We can continue and find     r  3   =  108  =   3  +  7  +   2  ⋅   7  2     =   213  7          subscript  r  3   108         3  7   normal-⋅  2   superscript  7  2           subscript  213  7      r_{3}=108=3+7+2\cdot 7^{2}=213_{7}   . Each time we carry out the calculation (that is, for each successive value of k ), one more base 7 digit is added for the next higher power of 7. In the 7-adic integers this sequence converges, and the limit is a square root of 2 in Z 7 which has initial 7-adic expansion         3  +  7  +   2  ⋅   7  2    +   6  ⋅   7  3    +   7  4   +   2  ⋅   7  5    +   7  6   +   2  ⋅   7  7    +   4  ⋅   7  8    +  ⋯   .      3  7   normal-⋅  2   superscript  7  2     normal-⋅  6   superscript  7  3     superscript  7  4    normal-⋅  2   superscript  7  5     superscript  7  6    normal-⋅  2   superscript  7  7     normal-⋅  4   superscript  7  8    normal-⋯    3+7+2\cdot 7^{2}+6\cdot 7^{3}+7^{4}+2\cdot 7^{5}+7^{6}+2\cdot 7^{7}+4\cdot 7^{%
 8}+\cdots.        If we started with the initial choice     r  1   =  4       subscript  r  1   4    r_{1}=4   then Hensel's lemma would produce a square root of 2 in Z 7 which is congruent to 4 (mod 7) instead of 3 (mod 7) and in fact this second square root would be the negative of the first square root (which is consistent with 4 = -3 mod 7).  As an example where the original version of Hensel's lemma is not valid but the more general one is, let f ( x ) = x 2 - 17 and a = 1. Then f ( a ) = -16 and f'( a ) = 2, so | f ( a )| 2  2 2 , which implies there is a unique 2-adic integer b satisfying b 2 = 17 and | b - a | 2 2 = 1/2, i.e., b ≡ 1 mod 4. There are two square roots of 17 in the 2-adic integers, differing by a sign, and although they are congruent mod 2 they are not congruent mod 4. This is consistent with the general version of Hensel's lemma only giving us a unique 2-adic square root of 17 that is congruent to 1 mod 4 rather than mod 2. If we had started with the initial approximate root a = 3 then we could apply the more general Hensel's lemma again to find a unique 2-adic square root of 17 which is congruent to 3 mod 4. This is the other 2-adic square root of 17.  In terms of lifting roots of x 2 - 17 from one modulus 2 k to the next 2 k +1 , the lifts starting with the root 1 mod 2 are as follows:    1 mod 2 --> 1, 3 mod 4  1 mod 4 --> 1, 5 mod 8 and 3 mod 4 ---> 3, 7 mod 8  1 mod 8 --> 1, 9 mod 16 and 7 mod 8 ---> 7, 15 mod 16, while 3 mod 8 and 5 mod 8 don't lift to roots mod 16  9 mod 16 --> 9, 25 mod 32 and 7 mod 16 --> 7, 23 mod 16, while 1 mod 16 and 15 mod 16 don't lift to roots mod 32.     For every k at least 3, there are four roots of x 2 - 17 mod 2 k , but if we look at their 2-adic expansions we can see that in pairs they are converging to just two 2-adic limits. For instance, the four roots mod 32 break up into two pairs of roots which each look the same mod 16:    9 = 1 + 2 3 and 25 = 1 + 2 3 + 2 4 , 7 = 1 + 2 + 2 2 and 23 = 1 + 2 + 2 2 + 2 4 .     The 2-adic square roots of 17 have expansions    1 + 2 3 + 2 5 + 2 6 + 2 7 + 2 9 + 2 10 + ..., 1 + 2 + 2 2 + 2 4 + 2 8 + 2 11 ...     Another example where we can use the more general version of Hensel's lemma but not the basic version is a proof that any 3-adic integer c ≡ 1 mod 9 is a cube in Z 3 . Let f ( x ) = x 3 - c and take initial approximation a = 1. The basic Hensel's lemma cannot be used to find roots of f ( x ) since f'( r ) ≡ 0 mod 3 for every r . To apply the general version of Hensel's lemma we want |f(1)| 3 3 2 , which means c ≡ 1 mod 27. That is, if c ≡ 1 mod 27 then the general Hensel's lemma tells us f ( x ) has a 3-adic root, so c is a 3-adic cube. However, we wanted to have this result under the weaker condition that c ≡ 1 mod 9. If c ≡ 1 mod 9 then c ≡ 1, 10, or 19 mod 27. We can apply the general Hensel's lemma three times depending on the value of c mod 27: if c ≡ 1 mod 27 then use a = 1, if c ≡ 10 mod 27 then use a = 4 (since 4 is a root of f ( x ) mod 27), and if c ≡ 19 mod 27 then use a = 7. (It is not true that every c ≡ 1 mod 3 is a 3-adic cube, e.g., 4 is not a 3-adic cube since it is not a cube mod 9.)  In a similar way, after some preliminary work Hensel's lemma can be used to show that for any odd prime number p , any p -adic integer c which is 1 mod p 2 is a p -th power in Z p . (This is false when p is 2.)  Generalizations  Suppose A is a commutative ring , complete with respect to an ideal     𝔪  A     subscript  𝔪  A    \mathfrak{m}_{A}   , and let     f   (  x  )    ∈   A   [  x  ]          f  x     A   delimited-[]  x      f(x)\in A[x]   be a polynomial with coefficients in A . Then if a ∈ A is an "approximate root" of f in the sense that it satisfies       f   (  a  )    ≡    0   mod    f  ′     (  a  )   2   𝔪          f  a    modulo  0     superscript  f  normal-′    superscript  a  2   𝔪      f(a)\equiv 0\,\bmod{f^{\prime}(a)^{2}\mathfrak{m}}     then there is an exact root b ∈ A of f "close to" a ; that is,       f   (  b  )    =  0        f  b   0    f(b)=0     and       b  ≡    a   mod    f  ′    (  a  )   𝔪     .      b   modulo  a     superscript  f  normal-′   a  𝔪      b\equiv a\,\bmod{f^{\prime}(a)\mathfrak{m}}.     Further, if f ′( a ) is not a zero-divisor then b is unique.  As a special case, if     f   (  a  )    ≡    0   mod  𝔪         f  a    modulo  0  𝔪     f(a)\equiv 0\,\bmod{\mathfrak{m}}   and f ′( a ) is a unit in A then there is a unique solution to f ( b ) = 0 in A such that     b  ≡    a   mod  𝔪    .      b   modulo  a  𝔪     b\equiv a\,\bmod{\mathfrak{m}}.     This result can be generalized to several variables as follows:  Theorem : Let A be a commutative ring that is complete with respect to an ideal m ⊂ A and f i ( x ) ∈ A [ x 1 , …, x n ] for i = 1,..., n be a system of n polynomials in n variables over A . Let f = ( f 1 ,..., f n ), viewed as a mapping from A n to A n , and let J f ( x ) be the Jacobian matrix of f . Suppose some a = ( a 1 , …, a n ) ∈ A n is an approximate solution to f = 0 in the sense that   f i ( a ) ≡ 0 mod (det J f ( a )) 2 m    for 1 ≤ i ≤ n . Then there is some b = ( b 1 , …, b n ) in A n satisfying f ( b ) = 0 , i.e.,   f i ( b ) = 0 for all i ,   and furthermore this solution is "close" to a in the sense that   b i ≡ a i mod J f ( a ) m    for 1 ≤ i ≤ n .  As a special case, if f i ( a ) ≡ 0 mod m for all i and det J f ( a ) is a unit in A then there is a solution to f ( b ) = 0 with b i ≡ a i mod m for all i .  When n = 1, a = a is an element of A and J f ( a ) = J f ( a ) is f ′( a ). The hypotheses of this multivariable Hensel's lemma reduce to the ones which were stated in the one-variable Hensel's lemma.  Related concepts  Completeness of a ring is not a necessary condition for the ring to have the Henselian property: Goro Azumaya in 1950 defined a commutative local ring satisfying the Henselian property for the maximal ideal m to be a Henselian ring .  Masayoshi Nagata proved in the 1950s that for any commutative local ring A with maximal ideal m there always exists a smallest ring A h containing A such that A h is Henselian with respect to m A h . This A h is called the Henselization of A . If A is noetherian , A h will also be noetherian, and A h is manifestly algebraic as it is constructed as a limit of étale neighbourhoods . This means that A h is usually much smaller than the completion Â while still retaining the Henselian property and remaining in the same category .
