   Parallelizable manifold      Parallelizable manifold   In mathematics , a differentiable manifold   M   M   \scriptstyle M   of dimension n is called parallelizable 1 if there exist smooth  vector fields      {   V  1   ,  …  ,   V  n   }      subscript  V  1   normal-…   subscript  V  n     \{V_{1},\dots,V_{n}\}     on the manifold, such that at any point   p   p   \scriptstyle p   of   M   M   \scriptstyle M   the tangent vectors      {    V  1    (  p  )    ,  …  ,    V  n    (  p  )    }        subscript  V  1   p   normal-…     subscript  V  n   p     \{V_{1}(p),\dots,V_{n}(p)\}     provide a basis of the tangent space at   p   p   \scriptstyle p   . Equivalently, the tangent bundle is a trivial bundle , 2 so that the associated principal bundle of linear frames has a section on    M  .    M   \scriptstyle M.     A particular choice of such a basis of vector fields on   M   M   \scriptstyle M   is called a parallelization (or an absolute parallelism ) of   M   M   \scriptstyle M   .  Examples   An example with n = 1 is the circle : we can take V 1 to be the unit tangent vector field, say pointing in the anti-clockwise direction. The torus of dimension n is also parallelizable, as can be seen by expressing it as a cartesian product of circles. For example, take n = 2, and construct a torus from a square of graph paper with opposite edges glued together, to get an idea of the two tangent directions at each point. More generally, any Lie group  G is parallelizable, since a basis for the tangent space at the identity element can be moved around by the action of the translation group of G on G (any translation is a diffeomorphism and therefore these translations induce linear isomorphisms between tangent spaces of points in G ).    A classical problem was to determine which of the spheres  S n are parallelizable. The zero-dimensional case S 0 is trivially parallelizable. The case S 1 is the circle, which is parallelizable as has already been explained. The hairy ball theorem shows that S 2 is not parallelizable. However S 3 is parallelizable, since it is the Lie group SU(2) . The only other parallelizable sphere is S 7 ; this was proved in 1958, by Michel Kervaire , and by Raoul Bott and John Milnor , in independent work. The parallelizable spheres correspond precisely to elements of unit norm in the normed division algebras of the real numbers, complex numbers, quaternions , and octonions , which allows one to construct a parallelism for each. Proving that other spheres are not parallelizable is more difficult, and requires algebraic topology .    The product of parallelizable manifolds is parallelizable.    Any orientable  three-dimensional manifold is parallelizable.   Remarks   The term framed manifold (occasionally rigged manifold ) is most usually applied to an embedded manifold with a given trivialisation of the normal bundle , and also for an abstract (i.e. non-embedded) manifold with a given stable trivialisation of the tangent bundle .
