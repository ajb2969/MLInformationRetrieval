   Hausdorff density      Hausdorff density   In measure theory , a field of mathematics, the Hausdorff density measures how concentrated a Radon measure is at some point.  Definition  Let   μ   μ   \mu   be a Radon measure and    a  ∈   ℝ  n       a   superscript  ℝ  n     a\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   some point in Euclidean space . The s -dimensional upper and lower Hausdorff densities are defined to be, respectively,        Θ    *  s     (  μ  ,  a  )    =    lim sup   r  →  0      μ   (    B  r    (  a  )    )     r  s            superscript  normal-Θ    absent  s     μ  a      subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  r  0        μ     subscript  B  r   a     superscript  r  s       \Theta^{*s}(\mu,a)=\limsup_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{\mu(B_{r}(a))}{r^{s}}   and        Θ  *  s    (  μ  ,  a  )    =    lim inf   r  →  0      μ   (    B  r    (  a  )    )     r  s            superscript   subscript  normal-Θ    s    μ  a      subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  r  0        μ     subscript  B  r   a     superscript  r  s       \Theta_{*}^{s}(\mu,a)=\liminf_{r\rightarrow 0}\frac{\mu(B_{r}(a))}{r^{s}}   where     B  r    (  a  )        subscript  B  r   a    B_{r}(a)   is the ball of radius r > 0 centered at a . Clearly,      Θ  *  s    (  μ  ,  a  )    ≤    Θ    *  s     (  μ  ,  a  )           superscript   subscript  normal-Θ    s    μ  a       superscript  normal-Θ    absent  s     μ  a      \Theta_{*}^{s}(\mu,a)\leq\Theta^{*s}(\mu,a)   for all    a  ∈   ℝ  n       a   superscript  ℝ  n     a\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   . In the event that the two are equal, we call their common value the s-density of   μ   μ   \mu   at a and denote it     Θ  s    (  μ  ,  a  )        superscript  normal-Θ  s    μ  a     \Theta^{s}(\mu,a)   .  Marstrand's theorem  The following theorem states that the times when the s -density exists are rather seldom.   Marstrand's theorem: Let   μ   μ   \mu   be a Radon measure on    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   . Suppose that the s -density     Θ  s    (  μ  ,  a  )        superscript  normal-Θ  s    μ  a     \Theta^{s}(\mu,a)   exists and is positive and finite for a in a set of positive   μ   μ   \mu   measure. Then s is an integer.   Preiss' theorem  In 1987 Preiss proved a stronger version of Marstrand's theorem. One consequence is that sets with positive and finite density are rectifiable sets .   Preiss' theorem: Let   μ   μ   \mu   be a Radon measure on    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   . Suppose that m      ≥  1      absent  1    \geq 1   is an integer and the m -density     Θ  m    (  μ  ,  a  )        superscript  normal-Θ  m    μ  a     \Theta^{m}(\mu,a)   exists and is positive and finite for   μ   μ   \mu   almost every a in the support of   μ   μ   \mu   . Then   μ   μ   \mu   is m -rectifiable, i.e.    μ  ≪   H  m      much-less-than  μ   superscript  H  m     \mu\ll H^{m}   (   μ   μ   \mu   is absolutely continuous with respect to Hausdorff measure     H  m     superscript  H  m    H^{m}   ) and the support of   μ   μ   \mu   is an m -rectifiable set.
