Hausdorff density

In measure theory, a field of mathematics, the Hausdorff density measures how concentrated a Radon measure is at some point.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Radon measure and 
 
 
 
  some point in Euclidean space. The s-dimensional upper and lower Hausdorff densities are defined to be, respectively,


 
  and


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the ball of radius r > 0 centered at a. Clearly, 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . In the event that the two are equal, we call their common value the s-density of 
 
 
 
  at a and denote it 
 
 
 
 .
Marstrand's theorem
The following theorem states that the times when the s-density exists are rather seldom.

Marstrand's theorem: Let 
 
 
 
  be a Radon measure on 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that the s-density 
 
 
 
  exists and is positive and finite for a in a set of positive 
 
 
 
  measure. Then s is an integer.
 

Preiss' theorem
In 1987 Preiss proved a stronger version of Marstrand's theorem. One consequence is that sets with positive and finite density are rectifiable sets.

Preiss' theorem: Let 
 
 
 
  be a Radon measure on 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that m

 
  is an integer and the m-density 
 
 
 
  exists and is positive and finite for 
 
 
 
  almost every a in the support of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is m-rectifiable, i.e. 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
  is absolutely continuous with respect to Hausdorff measure

 
 ) and the support of 
 
 
 
  is an m-rectifiable set.
