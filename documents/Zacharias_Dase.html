<h1>Zacharias Dase</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>Johann Martin Zacharias Dase</strong> (June 23, 1824, <a class="uri" href="Hamburg" title="wikilink">Hamburg</a> – September 11, 1861, Hamburg) was a German <a href="mental_calculator" title="wikilink">mental calculator</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>He attended schools in Hamburg from a very early age, but later admitted that his instruction had little influence on him. He used to spend a lot of time playing <a class="uri" href="dominoes" title="wikilink">dominoes</a>, and suggested that this played a significant role in developing his calculating skills. Dase suffered from <a class="uri" href="epilepsy" title="wikilink">epilepsy</a> from early childhood throughout his life.</p>

<p>At age 15 he began to travel extensively, giving exhibitions in Germany, Austria and England. Among his most impressive feats, he multiplied 79532853 × 93758479 in 54 seconds. He multiplied two 20-digit numbers in 6 minutes; two 40-digit numbers in 40 minutes; and two 100-digit numbers in 8 hours 45 minutes. The famous mathematician <a href="Carl_Friedrich_Gauss" title="wikilink">Carl Friedrich Gauss</a> commented that someone skilled in calculation could have done the 100-digit calculation in about half that time with pencil and paper.</p>

<p>These exhibitions however did not earn him enough money, so he tried to find other employments. In 1844 he obtained a position in the Railway Department of Vienna, but this didn't last long since in 1845 he was reported in Mannheim and in 1846 in Berlin.</p>

<p>In 1844, Dase calculated <a class="uri" href="π" title="wikilink">π</a> to 200 decimal places over the course of approximately two months, a record for the time, from the <a href="Machin-like_formula" title="wikilink">Machin-like formula</a>:</p>

<p>He also calculated a 7-digit <a href="logarithm_table" title="wikilink">logarithm table</a> and extended a table of <a href="integer_factorization" title="wikilink">integer factorizations</a> from 7,000,000 to 10,000,000.</p>

<p>Dase had very little knowledge of mathematical theory. The mathematician <a href="Julius_Petersen" title="wikilink">Julius Petersen</a> tried to teach him some of <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a>'s theorems, but gave up the task once he realized that their comprehension was beyond Dase's capabilities. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Gauss however was very impressed with his calculating skill, and he recommended that the <em>Hamburg Academy of Sciences</em> should allow Dase to do mathematical work on a full-time basis, but Dase died shortly thereafter.</p>

<p>The book "<a href="Gödel,_Escher,_Bach" title="wikilink">Gödel, Escher, Bach</a>" by <a href="Douglas_Hofstadter" title="wikilink">Douglas Hofstadter</a> mentions his calculating abilities. "... he also had an uncanny sense of quantity. That is, he could just 'tell', without counting, how many sheep were in a field, or words in a sentence, and so forth, up to about 30."</p>
