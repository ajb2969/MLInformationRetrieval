   Crosscap number      Crosscap number   In the mathematical field of knot theory , the crosscap number of a knot  K is the minimum of       1  -   χ   (  S  )     ,      1    χ  S     1-\chi(S),\,     taken over all compact , connected , non-orientable  surfaces  S bounding K ; here   χ   χ   \chi   is the Euler characteristic . The crosscap number of the unknot is zero, as the Euler characteristic of the disk is one.  Examples   The crosscap number of the trefoil knot is 1, as it bounds a Möbius strip and is not trivial.  The crosscap number of a torus knot was determined by M. Teragaito.   The formula for the knot sum is          C   (   k  1   )    +   C   (   k  2   )     -  1   ≤   C   (    k  1   #   k  2    )    ≤    C   (   k  1   )    +   C   (   k  2   )      .
