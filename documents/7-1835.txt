Crosscap number

In the mathematical field of knot theory, the crosscap number of a knot K is the minimum of



taken over all compact, connected, non-orientable surfaces S bounding K; here 
 
 
 
  is the Euler characteristic. The crosscap number of the unknot is zero, as the Euler characteristic of the disk is one.
Examples

The crosscap number of the trefoil knot is 1, as it bounds a Möbius strip and is not trivial.
The crosscap number of a torus knot was determined by M. Teragaito.

The formula for the knot sum is
