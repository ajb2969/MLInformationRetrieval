Weierstrass functions

In mathematics, the Weierstrass functions are special functions of a complex variable that are auxiliary to the Weierstrass elliptic function. They are named for Karl Weierstrass.
Weierstrass sigma-function
The Weierstrass sigma-function associated to a two-dimensional lattice

 
  is defined to be the product


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes 
 
 
 
 .
Weierstrass zeta-function
The Weierstrass zeta-function is defined by the sum



Note that the Weierstrass zeta-function is basically the logarithmic derivative of the sigma-function. The zeta-function can be rewritten as:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Eisenstein series of weight 2k + 2.
Also note that the derivative of the zeta-function is 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Weierstrass elliptic function
The Weierstrass zeta-function should not be confused with the Riemann zeta-function in number theory.
Weierstrass eta-function
The Weierstrass eta-function is defined to be



It can be proved that this is well-defined, i.e. 
 
 
 
  only depends on w. The Weierstrass eta-function should not be confused with the Dedekind eta-function.
Weierstrass p-function
The Weierstrass p-function is defined to be



The Weierstrass p-function is an even elliptic function of order N=2 with a double pole at each lattice and no others.
