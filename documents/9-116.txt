   Minkowski's bound      Minkowski's bound   In algebraic number theory , Minkowski's bound gives an upper bound of the norm of ideals to be checked in order to determine the class number of a number field  K . It is named for the mathematician Hermann Minkowski .  Definition  Let D be the discriminant of the field, n be the degree of K over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , and     2   r  2    =   n  -   r  1          2   subscript  r  2      n   subscript  r  1      2r_{2}=n-r_{1}   be the number of complex embeddings where    r  1     subscript  r  1    r_{1}   is the number of real embeddings . Then every class in the ideal class group of K contains an integral ideal of norm not exceeding Minkowski's bound        M  K   =     |  D  |      (   4  π   )    r  2       n  !    n  n       .       subscript  M  K         D     superscript    4  π    subscript  r  2        n    superscript  n  n       M_{K}=\sqrt{|D|}\left(\frac{4}{\pi}\right)^{r_{2}}\frac{n!}{n^{n}}\ .     Minkowski's constant for the field K is this bound M K . 1  Properties  Since the number of integral ideals of given norm is finite, the finiteness of the class number is an immediate consequence, 2 and further, the ideal class group is generated by the prime ideals of norm at most M K .  Minkowski's bound may be used to derive a lower bound for the discriminant of a field K given n , r 1 and r 2 . Since an integral ideal has norm at least one, we have 1 ≤ M K , so that         |  D  |    ≥     (   π  4   )    r  2      n  n    n  !     ≥     (   π  4   )    n  /  2       n  n    n  !       .            D       superscript    π  4    subscript  r  2       superscript  n  n     n             superscript    π  4     n  2       superscript  n  n     n        \sqrt{|D|}\geq\left(\frac{\pi}{4}\right)^{r_{2}}\frac{n^{n}}{n!}\geq\left(%
 \frac{\pi}{4}\right)^{n/2}\frac{n^{n}}{n!}\ .     For n at least 2, it is easy to show that the lower bound is greater than 1, so we obtain Minkowski's Theorem , that the discriminant of every number field, other than Q , is non-trivial. This implies that the field of rational numbers has no unramified extension .  Proof  The result is a consequence of Minkowski's theorem .  References       External links    Stevenhagen, Peter.
