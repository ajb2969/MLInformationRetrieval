   Hydrostatic stress      Hydrostatic stress   In continuum mechanics , a hydrostatic stress is an isotropic  stress that is given by the weight of water above a certain point. It is often used interchangeably with " pressure " and is also known as confining stress, particularly in the field of geomechanics. Its magnitude    σ  h     subscript  σ  h    \sigma_{h}   can be given by:       σ  h   =    ∑   i  =  1   n     ρ  i   g   h  i          subscript  σ  h     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  ρ  i   g   subscript  h  i       \sigma_{h}=\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^{n}\rho_{i}gh_{i}     where   i   i   i   is an index denoting each distinct layer of material above the point of interest,    ρ  i     subscript  ρ  i    \rho_{i}   is the density of each layer,   g   g   g   is the gravitational acceleration (assumed constant here; this can be substituted with any acceleration that is important in defining weight ), and    h  i     subscript  h  i    h_{i}   is the height (or thickness) of each given layer of material. For example, the magnitude of the hydrostatic stress felt at a point under ten meters of fresh water would be       σ   h  ,   s  a  n  d     =    ρ  w   g   h  w    =        1000    kg/m  3    ⋅   9.8     m/s  2    ⋅   10    m   =      9.8  ⋅   10  4    k  g   /  m    s  2    =     9.8  ⋅   10  4    N   /   m  2           subscript  σ   h    s  a  n  d        subscript  ρ  w   g   subscript  h  w            normal-⋅     normal-⋅    1000   superscript  kg/m  3    9.8    superscript  m/s  2    10   m               normal-⋅  9.8   superscript  10  4    k  g   m    superscript  s  2              normal-⋅  9.8   superscript  10  4    N    superscript  m  2       \sigma_{h,sand}=\rho_{w}gh_{w}=1000\,\text{kg/m}^{3}\cdot 9.8\,\text{m/s}^{2}%
 \cdot 10\,\text{m}=9.8\cdot{10^{4}}{kg/ms^{2}}=9.8\cdot 10^{4}{N/m^{2}}     where the index   w   w   w   indicates "water".  Because the hydrostatic stress is isotropic, it acts equally in all directions. In tensor form, the hydrostatic stress is equal to        σ  h   ⋅   I  3    =   [      σ  h     0    0      0     σ  h     0      0    0     σ  h      ]        normal-⋅   subscript  σ  h    subscript  I  3     delimited-[]     subscript  σ  h   0  0    0   subscript  σ  h   0    0  0   subscript  σ  h        \sigma_{h}\cdot I_{3}=\left[\begin{array}[]{ccc}\sigma_{h}&0&0\\
 0&\sigma_{h}&0\\
 0&0&\sigma_{h}\end{array}\right]     where    I  3     subscript  I  3    I_{3}   is the 3-by-3 identity matrix .  "  Category:Continuum mechanics  Category:Orientation (geometry)
