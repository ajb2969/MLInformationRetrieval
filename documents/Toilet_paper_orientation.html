<h1>Toilet paper orientation</h1>
<hr/>

<p><a href="Toilet_paper" title="wikilink">Toilet paper</a> when used with a <a href="toilet_roll_holder" title="wikilink">toilet roll holder</a> with a horizontal <a class="uri" href="axle" title="wikilink">axle</a> <a href="parallel_(geometry)" title="wikilink">parallel</a> to the floor and also parallel to the wall has two possible orientations: the toilet paper may hang <em>over</em> (in front of) or <em>under</em> (behind) the roll; if perpendicular to the wall, the two orientations are right-left or near-away. The choice is largely a matter of personal preference, dictated by <a href="habit_(psychology)" title="wikilink">habit</a>. In surveys of US consumers and of bath and kitchen specialists, 60–70 percent of respondents prefer <em>over</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>While many people consider this topic unimportant, some hold strong opinions on the matter. Advice columnist <a href="Ann_Landers" title="wikilink">Ann Landers</a> said that the subject was the most responded to (15,000 letters in 1986) and controversial issue in her column's history. Defenders of either position cite advantages ranging from aesthetics, hospitality, and cleanliness to paper conservation, the ease of detaching individual squares, and compatibility with a <a href="recreational_vehicle" title="wikilink">recreational vehicle</a> or a <a class="uri" href="cat" title="wikilink">cat</a>. Some writers have proposed connections to age, sex, or political philosophy, and survey evidence has shown a correlation with socioeconomic status.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> A generic answer is that it should hang the way the person doing the roll changing prefers.</p>

<p>Solutions range from compromise, to using separate dispensers or separate bathrooms entirely, or simply ignoring the issue altogether. One man advocates a plan under which his country will standardize on a single forced orientation, and at least one inventor hopes to popularize a new kind of toilet roll holder which swivels from one orientation to the other.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="context-and-relevance">Context and relevance</h2>

<p>In the article "Bathroom Politics: Introducing Students to Sociological Thinking from the Bottom Up", <a href="Eastern_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Eastern Institute of Technology</a> <a class="uri" href="sociology" title="wikilink">sociology</a> professor Edgar Alan Burns describes some reasons toilet paper politics is worthy of examination. On the first day of Burns' introductory course in sociology, he asks his students, "Which way do you think a roll of toilet paper should hang?" In the following fifty minutes, the students examine why they picked their answers, exploring the <a href="social_construction" title="wikilink">social construction</a> of "rules and practices which they have never consciously thought about before". They make connections to larger themes of sociology, including <a href="gender_role" title="wikilink">gender roles</a>, the <a href="public_sphere" title="wikilink">public</a> and <a href="private_sphere" title="wikilink">private spheres</a>, <a href="race_(classification_of_human_beings)" title="wikilink">race</a> and <a class="uri" href="ethnicity" title="wikilink">ethnicity</a>, <a href="social_class" title="wikilink">social class</a>, and age. Moreover, Burns argues that there is an additional lesson: </p>

<p>Burns' activity has been adopted by a <a href="social_psychology" title="wikilink">social psychology</a> course at the <a href="University_of_Notre_Dame" title="wikilink">University of Notre Dame</a>, where it is used to illustrate the principles of <a href="Peter_L._Berger" title="wikilink">Berger</a> and <a href="Thomas_Luckmann" title="wikilink">Luckmann</a>'s 1966 classic <em><a href="The_Social_Construction_of_Reality" title="wikilink">The Social Construction of Reality</a></em>. Similar everyday topics that have been used to awaken the <a href="sociological_imagination" title="wikilink">sociological imagination</a> include games of <a class="uri" href="tic-tac-toe" title="wikilink">tic-tac-toe</a>, violations of <a href="personal_space" title="wikilink">personal space</a>, the rules of walking, and the etiquette of which urinals men choose in <a href="public_restroom" title="wikilink">public restrooms</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Christopher_Peterson_(psychologist)" title="wikilink">Christopher Peterson</a>, a professor of psychology at the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a>, classifies the choice of toilet paper orientation under "tastes, preferences, and interests" as opposed to either <a href="value_(personal_and_cultural)" title="wikilink">values</a> or "attitudes, traits, norms, and needs". Other personal interests include one's favorite cola or baseball team. Interests are an important part of <a href="identity_(social_science)" title="wikilink">identity</a>; one expects and prefers that different people have different interests, which serves one's "sense of uniqueness". Differences in interests usually lead at most to teasing and gentle chiding. For most people, interests don't cause the serious divisions caused by conflicts of values; a possible exception is what Peterson calls "the 'get a life' folks among us" who elevate interests into moral issues.</p>

<p><a href="Morton_Ann_Gernsbacher" title="wikilink">Morton Ann Gernsbacher</a>, a professor of psychology at the <a href="University_of_Wisconsin–Madison" title="wikilink">University of Wisconsin–Madison</a>, compares the orientation of toilet paper to the orientation of cutlery in a dishwasher, the choice of which drawer in a <a href="chest_of_drawers" title="wikilink">chest of drawers</a> to place one's socks, and the order of shampooing one's hair and lathering one's body in the shower. In each choice, there is a prototypical solution chosen by the majority, and it is tempting to offer simplistic explanations of how the minority must be different. She warns that <a class="uri" href="neuroimaging" title="wikilink">neuroimaging</a> experiments—which as of 2007 were beginning to probe behaviors from <a href="mental_rotation" title="wikilink">mental rotation</a> and <a href="facial_expression" title="wikilink">facial expressions</a> to grocery shopping and <a class="uri" href="tickling" title="wikilink">tickling</a>—must strive to avoid such <a href="cultural_bias" title="wikilink">cultural bias</a> and <a href="stereotype" title="wikilink">stereotypes</a>.</p>

<p>In his book <em><a href="Conversational_Capital" title="wikilink">Conversational Capital</a></em>, Bertrand Cesvet gives toilet paper placement as an example of <a href="ritual" title="wikilink">ritualized</a> behavior—one of the ways designers and marketers can create a memorable experience around a product that leads to <a class="uri" href="word-of-mouth" title="wikilink">word-of-mouth</a> momentum. Cesvet's other examples include shaking a box of <a href="Tic_Tac" title="wikilink">Tic Tacs</a> and dissecting <a class="uri" href="Oreo" title="wikilink">Oreo</a> cookies.</p>

<p>Sometimes toilet paper is simply entertaining. In between songs at a concert, <a href="John_Hiatt" title="wikilink">John Hiatt</a> will sometimes tell the tale of his wife switching her preference. Broadcaster <a href="Jim_Bohannon" title="wikilink">Jim Bohannon</a>, who once spent an hour on toilet paper orientation, explains that such issues are good for <a href="talk_radio" title="wikilink">talk radio</a>: "It is an interactive medium, a certain kind of clash, it doesn't have to be a violent clash, but at least a disagreement would certainly be at the top of the list. It has to be something that's of general interest."</p>

<p>There is a difficulty in the medium of television: on the major American <a href="television_network" title="wikilink">networks</a> <a class="uri" href="NBC" title="wikilink">NBC</a> and <a class="uri" href="CBS" title="wikilink">CBS</a>, as of 1987, toilet paper was not allowed to be shown hanging next to the toilet. The 1970s sitcom <em><a href="All_in_the_Family" title="wikilink">All in the Family</a></em> was the first show to include a discussion of toilet paper, when <a href="Archie_Bunker" title="wikilink">Archie</a> yelled at <a href="Michael_Stivic" title="wikilink">Meathead</a> for hanging the paper <em>under</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> In a 1995 episode of <em><a href="The_Simpsons" title="wikilink">The Simpsons</a></em>, "<a href="Home_Sweet_Homediddly-Dum-Doodily" title="wikilink">Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily</a>", the children are confiscated by <a href="Child_Protective_Services" title="wikilink">Child Protective Services</a>, who hand <a href="Marge_Simpson" title="wikilink">Marge</a> a note citing her home as a "squalid hellhole" where the toilet paper is "hung in improper overhand fashion".</p>
<h2 id="arguments-for-over-or-under">Arguments for over or under</h2>

<p>  The main reasons given by people to explain why they hang their toilet paper a given way are ease of grabbing and habit. Some particular advantages cited for each orientation include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Over</em> reduces the risk of accidentally brushing the wall or cabinet with one's knuckles, potentially transferring grime and germs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Over</em> makes it easier to visually locate and to grasp the loose end.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Over</em> gives hotels, cruise ships, office buildings, public places and homeowners with guest bathrooms the option <a href="hotel_toilet_paper_folding" title="wikilink">to fold over the last sheet</a> to show that the room has been cleaned.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Over</em> is generally the intended direction of viewing for the manufacturer's branding, so patterned toilet paper looks better this way.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em>Under</em> provides a tidier appearance, in that the loose end can be more hidden from view.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Under</em> reduces the risk that a toddler or a house pet, such as a dog or cat, will completely unroll the toilet paper when batting at the roll.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></li>
<li><em>Under</em> in a <a href="recreational_vehicle" title="wikilink">recreational vehicle</a> may reduce unrolling during driving.</li>
</ul>

<p>Partisans have claimed that each method makes it easier to tear the toilet paper on a <a class="uri" href="perforated" title="wikilink">perforated</a> sheet boundary, depending on the direction of pulling and the use of a second hand to stabilize the roll.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> (A traveller from the U.S. to China in 1991 noted a different setup: non-perforated paper with a metal cutter above the roll, which obliges the <em>over</em> direction.)</p>

<p>It is unclear if one orientation is more economical than the other. The <em><a href="Centralian_Advocate" title="wikilink">Centralian Advocate</a></em> attributes a claim that <em>over</em> saves on paper usage to <a href="Planet_Green" title="wikilink">Planet Green</a>. A reader of <em><a href="The_Orange_County_Register" title="wikilink">The Orange County Register</a></em> found a "six-month study" by a "university in the U.S." that came to the same conclusion. But a reader of the <em><a href="Cape_Argus" title="wikilink">Cape Argus</a></em> wrote that a "British loo paper manufacturer" came to the opposite conclusion. In his humor compilation <em>How Hemlines Predict the Economy</em>, <a href="Peter_FitzSimons" title="wikilink">Peter FitzSimons</a> writes that placing the hanging flap against the wall "is generally twice as economical".</p>

<p>In the academic field of <a class="uri" href="evaluation" title="wikilink">evaluation</a>, <a href="Michael_Scriven" title="wikilink">Michael Scriven</a> writes that the question of the correct way to insert toilet paper is a "one-item aptitude test" for measuring one's evaluation skills. These skills include the evaluative attitude, practical logical analysis, empathy, teaching, and being a quick study. To prove one's competence, one may either derive the "one right answer" or prove that the test is or is not culturally biased.</p>
<h3 id="preliminaries">Preliminaries</h3>

<p>In their 2006 book <em>Why Not?</em>, <a href="Barry_Nalebuff" title="wikilink">Barry Nalebuff</a> and <a href="Ian_Ayres" title="wikilink">Ian Ayres</a> write that the debate over toilet paper is a debate about <a class="uri" href="symmetry" title="wikilink">symmetry</a> (they also write that too much paper has been wasted on the issue, and that they prefer <em>over</em>). By taking an approximately symmetric situation and flipping it around, one can sometimes arrive at a new solution to a problem with its own surprising advantages. Other physical examples include peeling a banana from the apex rather than the <a href="pedicel_(botany)" title="wikilink">pedicel</a>, or steering a car <a href="Steering#Rear_wheel_steering" title="wikilink">from the rear</a> rather than the front.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="reflection_symmetry" title="wikilink">reflection symmetry</a> between the left and right sides of the roll, so whether it rotates <a href="clockwise" title="wikilink">clockwise or counterclockwise</a> is ambiguous; it depends on one's point of view. The <a href="relative_direction" title="wikilink">up/down and front/back</a> symmetries are broken by the force of <a class="uri" href="gravity" title="wikilink">gravity</a> and the locations of the wall and the user, so one can distinguish between two orientations:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Over</em>: the end hangs away from the wall and dispenses over the top of the roll when pulled.</li>
<li><em>Under</em>: the end hangs next to the wall and dispenses under the bottom of the roll.</li>
</ul>

<p>This nomenclature can also be read ambiguously. In 1991, a customer wrote to <a href="Herb_Kelleher" title="wikilink">Herb Kelleher</a>, <a class="uri" href="chairman" title="wikilink">chairman</a> of <a href="Southwest_Airlines" title="wikilink">Southwest Airlines</a>, with an unusual complaint: "Dear Herb: ... Last week in my journey to SFO someone put the toilet paper in wrong. Any damn fool knows the papers come out the bottom of the roll and not over the top. I couldn't figure out how to correct the error ..." Kelleher replied, <a href="carbon_copy" title="wikilink">copying</a> his <a href="senior_management" title="wikilink">senior management</a> committee, <a href="general_counsel" title="wikilink">general counsel</a>, and <a href="customer_relations" title="wikilink">customer relations</a> manager: "Dear Jim: What the hell were you doing upside down in our lavatory?"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Kevin and Jackie Freiberg cite this episode in their book <em>Nuts!</em> as an example of Southwest's unconventional approach to customer service.</p>

<p>There are other everyday objects that dispense a sheet of material from a roll: fax machines, <a href="cash_register" title="wikilink">cash registers</a>, <a href="plastic_wrap" title="wikilink">plastic wrap</a>, aluminum foil, and <a href="parchment_paper_(baking)" title="wikilink">parchment paper</a>. One columnist who believes in the importance of toilet paper orientation writes, "all have to exit in the correct direction or it doesn't work, or you cut yourself, or both."</p>

<h3 id="survey-results">Survey results</h3>

<p>The question "Do you prefer that your toilet tissue unwinds over or under the spool?" is featured on the cover of Barry Sinrod and Mel Poretz's 1989 book <em>The First Really Important Survey of American Habits</em>. The overall result: 68 percent chose over. Sinrod explained, "To me, the essence of the book is the toilet paper question ... Either people don't care, or they care so much that they practically cause bodily injury to one another." Poretz observed, "The toilet-paper question galvanizes people almost like the <a href="Miller_Lite" title="wikilink">Miller Lite</a> tastes-great/less-filling commercial."</p>

<p>In Bernice Kanner's 1995 book <em>Are You Normal?</em>, 53 percent of survey respondents prefer <em>over</em>, while "a fourth" prefer <em>under</em> and 8 percent do not know or care.</p>

<p><em>Sitting Pretty: The History of the Toilet</em>, a <a href="travelling_exhibition" title="wikilink">travelling exhibition</a> that tours <a href="Canada" title="wikilink">Canadian</a> museums, asks visitors to register their preferred roll direction. When the exhibition reached <a href="Huntsville,_Ontario" title="wikilink">Huntsville, Ontario</a>, in June 2001, 13,000 visitors had taken the survey, with 67 percent preferring <em>over</em>. At the <a href="Saint_Boniface_Museum" title="wikilink">Saint Boniface Museum</a> in <a class="uri" href="Winnipeg" title="wikilink">Winnipeg</a> in February 2005, a voting machine registered 5,831 <em>over</em> versus 5,679 <em>under</em>, or 51 percent <em>over</em>. Saint Boniface's director noted, "I think there's been some cheating, though."</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Georgia-Pacific" title="wikilink">Georgia-Pacific</a> commissioned a survey of Americans' bathroom habits in 1993 to launch its new <a href="Quilted_Northern" title="wikilink">Quilted Northern</a> brand, and more surveys followed:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>1993 Practices and Preferences of Toilet Paper Users: 73 percent <em>over</em> out of 1,200 respondents. The press release claims, "A first-of-its-kind survey has settled, once and for all, the great toilet paper debate."</li>
<li>1994 Toilet Paper Report: 59 percent <em>over</em>, out of 1,000 respondents; conducted by <a href="KRC_Research_and_Consulting" title="wikilink">KRC Research and Consulting</a></li>
<li>1995 Bathroom Tissue Report: 59 percent <em>over</em> versus 29 percent <em>under</em>, out of 1,000 respondents; conducted by KRC Research and Consulting</li>
<li>2001 Bathroom Confidential: 63 percent <em>over</em> out of 1,001 respondents; conducted by <a href="Impulse_Research" title="wikilink">Impulse Research</a></li>
<li>2004 Bathroom Confidential: 72 percent <em>over</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></li>
</ul>

<p>In 1993, <a href="American_Standard_Brands" title="wikilink">American Standard Brands</a> conducted a poll of "designers, contractors, dealers, distributors and other bath and kitchen reps" at the <a href="Kitchen/Bath_Industry_Show_&amp;_Conference" title="wikilink">Kitchen/Bath Industry Show &amp; Conference</a> in <a href="Atlanta,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Atlanta, Georgia</a>. The question: "What is the correct and only way to hang the toilet paper – under or over?" <em>Over</em> won 59 percent of the vote, 1,826 to 1,256. American Standard spokeswoman Nora Monroe observed, "The bathroom is a territorial place. You'd be surprised how many people have definite opinions on this issue." In 2008, American Standard commissioned the 2008 Bathroom Habits Survey, a more traditional format conducted by <a href="Opinion_Research_Corporation" title="wikilink">Opinion Research Corporation</a> with 1,001 respondents. This time, "three-quarters" answered <em>over</em>.</p>

<p>In 1995, a survey by <a href="Scott_Paper_Company" title="wikilink">Scott Paper Company</a>'s "Cottonelle College of Freshness Knowledge" had "most Americans over 50" preferring <em>over</em>. In another <a class="uri" href="Cottonelle" title="wikilink">Cottonelle</a> survey in 1999, 68 percent of respondents preferred <em>over</em> to 25 percent <em>under</em>. Columnist Bonnie Henry hypothesizes of the others: "Meanwhile, 7 percent – no doubt bored beyond belief at this point by the inane questioning – had slipped into a deep, irreversible coma."</p>

<p>On January 27, 2010, the 100th anniversary of <a href="Thomas_Crapper" title="wikilink">Thomas Crapper</a>'s death, Cottonelle launched a "Great Debate" advertising campaign, inviting American consumers to vote their preference at a Kimberly-Clark website.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> The result was announced during the <a href="82nd_Academy_Awards" title="wikilink">82nd Academy Awards</a>: 72 percent had voted <em>over</em>. In a more traditional preliminary survey of 1,000 Americans, Cottonelle found that "overs" are more likely than "unders" to notice a roll's direction (74 percent), to be annoyed when the direction is incorrect (24 percent), and to have flipped the direction at a friend's home (27 percent).</p>

<p>Besides orientation, toilet paper manufacturers and survey authors have studied other private practices around toilet paper: how much is used; whether it is torn off with one hand or two; whether it is torn off right-to-left or left-to-right; and whether it is crumpled or folded before use.</p>

<p>The book does not note the number of respondents in each segment, so it is difficult to say whether any of the deviations are <a href="statistically_significant" title="wikilink">statistically significant</a>, but there does not seem to be a difference between men's and women's preferences. Nonetheless, such a difference has been claimed by other authors, in both directions. The American Standard conference poll concluded: "Many men voted for over, saying it made the paper easier to reach." Inventor Curtis Batts arrives at a different conclusion from his personal experience: "Women like it over, and men like it under. I think it bugs women when it touches the wall." Advice columnist Ms Maud of <em><a href="The_Press" title="wikilink">The Press</a></em> asserts that women prefer <em>over</em> because they are "logical thinkers".</p>

<p>A Cottonelle survey indicated that men were more likely than women to notice, and become annoyed with, a toilet roll hung against their preference.</p>

<p>A <a class="uri" href="popular-culture" title="wikilink">popular-culture</a> occurrence of a gender theory is found in the <em><a href="Weekly_World_News" title="wikilink">Weekly World News</a></em>, a <a href="supermarket_tabloid" title="wikilink">supermarket tabloid</a> that runs outlandish stories for comedic effect. In the 2003 story <em>North Korea Shocker!</em>, the <em>WWN</em> claimed that North Korean leader <a href="Kim_Jong-il" title="wikilink">Kim Jong-il</a> was <a href="Passing_(gender)" title="wikilink">secretly female</a>.

<p>According to <em>W. C. Privy's Original Bathroom Companion, Number 2</em>, "By more than 4 to 1, older folks prefer to have their toilet paper dispense over the front." The same claim is made by James Buckley's <em>The Bathroom Companion</em> for people older than 50.</p>

<p>Sinrod observed of his survey, "60 percent of those who earn $50,000 or more prefer it to be over and 73 percent of those who earn less than $20,000 prefer under". On what that proves: "I don't know, but it's sure interesting."</p>

The answer was yes: 768 to 196, or 80 percent <em>over</em>. It was thought to be a question "which carried no political association". Yet one teenager's <a href="science_project" title="wikilink">science project</a> at the Southern Appalachian Science and Engineering Fair, and a favorite of the fair's coordinator, was a survey concluding that <a href="liberalism" title="wikilink">liberals</a> roll over while <a href="conservatism" title="wikilink">conservatives</a> roll under.</p>

<p>Advice columnist <a href="Ann_Landers" title="wikilink">Ann Landers</a> (<a href="Eppie_Lederer" title="wikilink">Eppie Lederer</a>) was once asked which way toilet paper should hang. She answered <em>under</em>, prompting thousands of letters in protest; she then recommended <em>over</em>, prompting thousands more. She reflected that the 15,000 letters made toilet paper the most controversial issue in her column's 31-year history, wondering, "With so many problems in the world, why were thousands of people making an issue of tissue?"</p>

<p>In November 1986, Landers told the <a href="Canadian_Commercial_Travellers_Association" title="wikilink">Canadian Commercial Travellers Association</a> that "Fine-quality toilet paper has designs that are right side up" in the <em>over</em> position. In 1996, she explained the issue on <em><a href="The_Oprah_Winfrey_Show" title="wikilink">The Oprah Winfrey Show</a></em>, where 68 percent of the <a href="studio_audience" title="wikilink">studio audience</a> favored <em>over</em>; <a href="Oprah_Winfrey" title="wikilink">Oprah</a> suggested that <em>under</em> uses more paper. In 1998, she wrote that the issue "seems destined to go on forever", insisting, "In spite of the fact that an overwhelming number of people prefer the roll hung so that the paper comes over the top, I still prefer to have the paper hanging close to the wall." On the day of her last column in 2002, Landers wrote, "P.S. The toilet paper hangs over the top." Her published commentary on the issue has even continued after her death. 2005 saw the premiere of a one-woman play written by <a href="David_Rambo" title="wikilink">David Rambo</a>: a character study of Ann Landers titled <em>The Lady with All the Answers</em>. Toilet paper comes up once again, and the actress surveys the audience for their opinions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>In his article in <em>Teaching Sociology</em>, Burns writes that the toilet paper hanging exercise is valuable in part because "[the] subject matter is familiar to everybody; everyone is an expert, and everyone has an opinion." The media have published the opinions of entertainers, advice columnists, and businesspeople, including the following:</p>

<h2 id="consequences">Consequences</h2>

<p>Toilet paper orientation is often mentioned as a hurdle for married couples.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The issue may also arise in businesses and public places.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Even at the <a href="Amundsen–Scott_Research_Station" title="wikilink">Amundsen–Scott Research Station</a> at the <a href="South_Pole" title="wikilink">South Pole</a>, complaints have been raised over which way to install toilet paper. During the six-month-long <a href="polar_night" title="wikilink">polar night</a>, a few dozen residents are stuck living together, and while many of the headaches of modern life are far away, food and hygiene are not. Despite the challenges posed by the hostile <a href="Antarctic_climate" title="wikilink">Antarctic climate</a>, "It is in the more mundane trials of everyday life that personality clashes are revealed."</p>
<h2 id="solutions">Solutions</h2>

<p>Some of the proposed solutions to this problem involve more or better technology, while others concentrate on human behavior.</p>
<h3 id="mechanical">Mechanical</h3>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Twelve rolls in a mix of states</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Tilt-A-Roll is a swiveling toilet paper dispenser invented by Curtis Batts, a <a class="uri" href="Dallas" title="wikilink">Dallas</a>-native <a href="industrial_engineer" title="wikilink">industrial engineer</a>. His patents on the invention published in 1996 and 1997,  and , summarize its design, stating, "An adjustable angle coupling secures the yoke to the mounting assembly and permits rotation of the yoke about an axis directed orthogonally through the spindle such that the paper roll can be oriented to unroll paper either from over or from under the roll as desired."</p>

<p>Batts explains that his parents argued over toilet paper placement "all the time", as do he and his wife; the device's motto is "Let Tilt-A-Roll save your marriage!" The Tilt-A-Roll has been featured on a variety of newspapers, magazines, radio interviews, and TV shows, including <em><a href="The_Tonight_Show_with_Jay_Leno" title="wikilink">The Tonight Show with Jay Leno</a></em>. Batts entered the Tilt-A-Roll at the 1999 <a href="InventHelp’s_INPEX_Invention_Trade_Show" title="wikilink">INPEX invention show</a>, the world's largest invention show with 800 inventions, and it won third place "for its appeal and simplicity".</p>

<p>Batts started out constructing the devices in a workshop in his garage. He explains, "I've had a few sleepless nights where I went 24 hours making these things. I've got to find a manufacturer for it. I can't keep up with the volume." As of 2000, Batts was still "in the process of selecting a distributor"; he has tried <a href="The_Home_Depot" title="wikilink">The Home Depot</a> and <a class="uri" href="QVC" title="wikilink">QVC</a>. As of 2008, the Tilt-A-Roll is on sale at Batt's website.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>An inventor named Rocky Hutson demonstrated a similar device he called the T.P. Swivel to the producers of the television program <em><a class="uri" href="PitchMen" title="wikilink">PitchMen</a></em> in late 2009. Of 173 entrants gathered at <a href="Ybor_City,_Tampa,_Florida" title="wikilink">Ybor City, Tampa, Florida</a>, Hutson was one of the twenty chosen to pitch their products to <a href="Anthony_Sullivan_(pitchman)" title="wikilink">Anthony Sullivan</a>. For his part, Hutson pulls his paper from the top of the roll.</p>

<p>Another solution: install two toilet paper dispensers, as is more common in public restrooms and hotels.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> A reader of the <em><a href="Annie's_Mailbox" title="wikilink">Annie's Mailbox</a></em> column recommends using a holder large enough to fit two rolls, noting that the roll mounted <em>over</em> is more popular. Another reader sidesteps the issue by foregoing the holder, instead piling five or six rolls in a big wicker basket. Even using separate bathrooms can help.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Other solutions include vertical holders, or simply not using a toilet roll holder at all.</p>
<h3 id="behavioral">Behavioral</h3>

<p>A <a href="Grand_Rapids,_Michigan" title="wikilink">Grand Rapids, Michigan</a>, toilet paper enthusiast named Bill Jarrett argues that previous polls have been too small. He wants a national <a class="uri" href="referendum" title="wikilink">referendum</a> with at least one million votes, with the result to decide a "national toilet paper hanging way" to be enforced by "the toilet paper police". Jarrett refuses to reveal his own preference; he even removed the toilet paper from his house's bathrooms before inviting in an <a href="Associated_Press" title="wikilink">AP</a> reporter for an interview. "I'm not saying because I don't want to influence the vote." Voting requires the purchase of a $5 debate kit. His value proposition to the nation: assuming that one can spend half an hour per year searching for the end of the toilet paper, the United States should save 90 million hours at home per year—and $300 million at the workplace.</p>

<p>Toilet paper orientation has been used rhetorically as the ultimate issue that government has no business dictating, in letters to the editor protesting the regulation of <a href="noise_pollution" title="wikilink">noise pollution</a> and stricter requirements to get a <a class="uri" href="divorce" title="wikilink">divorce</a>. In 2006, protesting <a href="New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">New Hampshire</a>'s <a href="List_of_smoking_bans_in_the_United_States#New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">ban on smoking</a> in restaurants and bars, representative Ralph Boehm (<a href="Republican_Party_(United_States)" title="wikilink">R</a>-<a href="Litchfield,_New_Hampshire" title="wikilink">Litchfield</a>) asked "Will we soon be told which direction the toilet paper must hang from the roll?"</p>

<p>In a column in the <em><a href="Houston_Chronicle" title="wikilink">Houston Chronicle</a></em>, Jack Brewer observes that it only takes five seconds to turn the roll "the right way" around (<em>over</em>), which is much less than the time it takes to "start a fuss" with his wife.</p>

<p>In a column in <em><a href="The_Grand_Rapids_Press" title="wikilink">The Grand Rapids Press</a></em>, Karin Orr relates her chance discovery that her husband and sister both turn the toilet paper around in others' houses—and in opposite directions. Orr writes, "You just can never really know another person."</p>

<p>David O'Connor's 2005 book <em>Henderson's House Rules: The Official Guide to Replacing the Toilet Paper and Other Domestic Topics of Great Dispute</em> aims to solve disagreements with a minimum of debate or compromise by offering authoritative, reasonable rules. The "House Rule" for toilet paper is <em>over and out</em>, and a full page is dedicated to a diagram of this orientation. But O'Connor writes that "if a female household member has a strong preference for the toilet paper to hang over and in, against the wall, that preference prevails. It is admittedly an odd preference, but women use toilet paper far more often than men—hence the rule."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="similar-controversies">Similar controversies</h2>

<p>Domestic strife can arise from many other situations where a household item, such as a tube of toothpaste, is left in the wrong state. Some closely related examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which way should a <a href="paper_towel" title="wikilink">paper towel</a> hang in the kitchen? When Ann Landers was asked this question in 1997, she replied, "I'm still trying to recover from the <a class="uri" href="flak" title="wikilink">flak</a> ... I'm not giving any more advice on how to hang anything."</li>
<li>Which way should a <a class="uri" href="Masonic" title="wikilink">Masonic</a> signet ring be oriented on the finger? With the legs of the compasses pointing into the wrist or outwards toward the fingers?</li>
<li>Should a toilet seat be left <a href="Toilet_seat#Etiquette" title="wikilink">up or down</a>? This debate involves a stronger asymmetry between the sexes, as women rarely want the seat up.</li>
<li>Should a <a href="twist_tie" title="wikilink">twist tie</a> be tightened clockwise or counter-clockwise? Since some store-bought products are pre-tied by machine, this question also pits consumer against engineer.</li>
<li>For a public restroom stall with a dispenser holding two rolls of paper, <a href="Donald_Knuth" title="wikilink">Donald Knuth</a> proposes classifying users into <em>big-choosers</em> (those who take paper from the roll that is currently larger) and <em>little-choosers</em> (those who do the opposite).
