Imaginary hyperelliptic curve

A hyperelliptic curve is a particular kind of algebraic curve. There exist hyperelliptic curves of every genus

 
 . If the genus of a hyperelliptic curve equals 1, we simply call the curve an elliptic curve. Hence we can see hyperelliptic curves as generalizations of elliptic curves. There is a well-known group structure on the set of points lying on an elliptic curve over some field

 
 , which we can describe geometrically with chords and tangents. Generalizing this group structure to the hyperelliptic case is not straightforward. We cannot define the same group law on the set of points lying on a hyperelliptic curve, instead a group structure can be defined on the so-called Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve. The computations differ depending on the number of points at infinity. This article is about imaginary hyperelliptic curves, these are hyperelliptic curves with exactly 1 point at infinity. Real hyperelliptic curves have two points at infinity.
Formal definition
Hyperelliptic curves can be defined over fields of any characteristic. Hence we consider an arbitrary field 
 
 
 
  and its algebraic closure

 
 . An (imaginary) hyperelliptic curve of genus 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is given by an equation of the form





where 
 
 
 
  is a polynomial of degree not larger than 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a monic polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore we require the curve to have no singular points. In our setting, this entails that no point 
 
 
 
  satisfies both 
 
 
 
  and the equations 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This definition differs from the definition of a general hyperelliptic curve in the fact that 
 
 
 
  can also have degree 
 
 
 
  in the general case. From now on we drop the adjective imaginary and simply talk about hyperelliptic curves, as is often done in literature. Note that the case 
 
 
 
  corresponds to 
 
 
 
  being a cubic polynomial, agreeing with the definition of an elliptic curve. If we view the curve as lying in the projective plane

 
  with coordinates 
 
 
 
 , we see that there is a particular point lying on the curve, namely the point at infinity

 
  denoted by 
 
 
 
 . So we could write 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose the point 
 
 
 
  not equal to 
 
 
 
  lies on the curve and consider 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  can be simplified to 
 
 
 
 , we see that 
 
 
 
  is also a point on the curve. 
 
 
 
  is called the opposite of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is called a Weierstrass point if 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, the opposite of 
 
 
 
  is simply defined as 
 
 
 
 .
Alternative definition
The definition of a hyperelliptic curve can be slightly simplified if we require that the characteristic of 
 
 
 
  is not equal to 2. To see this we consider the change of variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , which makes sense if char
 
 
 
 . Under this change of variables we rewrite 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  which, in turn, can be rewritten to 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  we know that 
 
 
 
  and hence 
 
 
 
  is a monic polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
 . This means that over a field 
 
 
 
  with char
 
 
 
  every hyperelliptic curve of genus 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to one given by an equation of the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a monic polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
  and the curve has no singular points. Note that for curves of this form it is easy to check whether the non-singularity criterion is met. A point 
 
 
 
  on the curve is singular if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , it must be the case that 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
  is a multiple root of 
 
 
 
 . We conclude that the curve 
 
 
 
  has no singular points if and only if 
 
 
 
  has no multiple roots. Even though the definition of a hyperelliptic curve is quite easy when char
 
 
 
 , we should not forget about fields of characteristic 2 as hyperelliptic curve cryptography makes extensive use of such fields.
Example
 As an example consider 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  has degree 5 and the roots are all distinct, 
 
 
 
  is a curve of genus 
 
 
 
 . Its graph is depicted in Figure 1.
From this picture it is immediately clear that we cannot use the chords and tangents method to define a group law on the set of points of a hyperelliptic curve. The group law on elliptic curves is based on the fact that a straight line through two points lying on an elliptic curve has a unique third intersection point with the curve. Note that this is always true since 
 
 
 
  lies on the curve. From the graph of 
 
 
 
  it is clear that this does not need to hold for an arbitrary hyperelliptic curve. Actually, Bézout's theorem states that a straight line and a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 intersect in 5 points. So, a straight line through two point lying on 
 
 
 
  does not have a unique third intersection point, it has three other intersection points.
Coordinate ring
The coordinate ring of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 is defined as


 
 .
The polynomial

 
  is irreducible over 
 
 
 
 , so


 
  is an integral domain.
Proof. If 
 
 
 
  were reducible over 
 
 
 
 , it would factor as 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  ∈ 
 
 
 
 . But then 
 
 
 
  so it has degree 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  so it has degree smaller than 
 
 
 
 , which is impossible.
Note that any polynomial function

 
  can be written uniquely as

 
   with

Norm and degree
The conjugate of a polynomial function 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is defined to be


 
 .
The norm of 
 
 
 
  is the polynomial function 
 
 
 
 . Note that  u(x)2 + u(x)v(x)h(x) - v(x)2f(x)}}, so 
 
 
 
  is a polynomial in only one variable.
If

Function field
The function field

 
  of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is the field of fractions of 
 
 
 
 , and the function field 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  is the field of fractions of 
 
 
 
 . The elements of 
 
 
 
  are called rational functions on 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
  such a rational function, and 
 
 
 
  a finite point on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is said to be defined at 
 
 
 
  if there exist polynomial functions 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and

  at 
 
 
 
  is


 
 . For 
 
 
 
  a point on 
 
 
 
  that is not finite, i.e. 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
 , we define 
 
 
 
  as:
 :If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 , i.e. R has a zero at O.

If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is not defined, i.e. R has a pole at O.
 
If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is the ratio of the leading coefficients of 
 
 
 
  and

If 
 
 
 
  is not defined at 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is said to have a pole at 
 
 
 
 , and we write 
 
 
 
 .
 

Order of a polynomial function at a point
For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the order of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is defined as:


 
  if 
 
 
 
  is a finite point which is not Weierstrass. Here 
 
 
 
  is the highest power of 
 
 
 
  which divides both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Write  (x - a)r(u0(x) - v0(x)y)}} and if  0}}, then 
 
 
 
  is the highest power of 
 
 
 
  which divides  u02 + u0v0h - v02f}}, otherwise, 
 
 
 
 .


 
  if 
 
 
 
  is a finite Weierstrass point, with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as above.


 
  if 
 
 
 
 .
The divisor and the Jacobian
In order to define the Jacobian, we first need the notion of a divisor. Consider a hyperelliptic curve 
 
 
 
  over some field 
 
 
 
 . Then we define a divisor 
 
 
 
  to be a formal sum of points in 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and furthermore 
 
 
 
  is a finite set. This means that a divisor is a finite formal sum of scalar multiples of points. Note that there is no simplification of 
 
 
 
  given by a single point (as one might expect from the analogy with elliptic curves). Furthermore we define the degree of 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . The set of all divisors 
 
 
 
  of the curve 
 
 
 
  forms an Abelian group where the addition is defined pointwise as follows 
 
 
 
 . It is easy to see that 
 
 
 
  acts as the identity element and that the inverse of 
 
 
 
  equals 
 
 
 
 . The set 
 
 
 
  of all divisors of degree 0 can easily be checked to be a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
Proof. Consider the map 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
 , note that 
 
 
 
  forms a group under the usual addition. Then 
 
 
 
  and hence 
 
 
 
  is a group homomorphism. Now, 
 
 
 
  is the kernel of this homomorphism and thus it is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
Consider a function 
 
 
 
 , then we can look at the formal sum div
 
 
 
 . Here ord
 
 
 
  denotes the order of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . We have that ord
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  has a pole of order -ord
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 , ord
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is defined and non-zero at 
 
 
 
  and ord
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  has a zero of order ord
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 .1 It can be shown that 
 
 
 
  has only a finite number of zeroes and poles,2 and thus only finitely many of the ord
 
 
 
  are non-zero. This implies that div
 
 
 
  is a divisor. Moreover, as 
 
 
 
 ,3 it is the case that div
 
 
 
  is a divisor of degree 0. Such divisors, i.e. divisors coming from some rational function 
 
 
 
 , are called principal divisors and the set of all principal divisors 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
Proof. The identity element 
 
 
 
  comes from a constant function which is non-zero. Suppose 
 
 
 
  are two principal divisors coming from 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. Then 
 
 
 
  comes from the function 
 
 
 
 , and thus 
 
 
 
  is a principal divisor, too. We conclude that 
 
 
 
  is closed under addition and inverses, making it into a subgroup.
We can now define the quotient group

 
  which is called the Jacobian or the Picard group of 
 
 
 
 . Two divisors 
 
 
 
  are called equivalent if they belong to the same element of 
 
 
 
 , this is the case if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a principal divisor. Consider for example a hyperelliptic curve 
 
 
 
  over a field 
 
 
 
  and a point 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
  the rational function 
 
 
 
  has a zero of order 
 
 
 
  at both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and it has a pole of order 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . Therefore we find div
 
 
 
  and we can simplify this to div
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is a Weierstrass point.
Example: the Jacobian of an elliptic curve
For elliptic curves the Jacobian turns out to simply be isomorphic to the usual group on the set of points on this curve, this is basically a corollary of the Abel-Jacobi theorem. To see this consider an elliptic curve 
 
 
 
  over a field 
 
 
 
 . The first step is to relate a divisor 
 
 
 
  to every point 
 
 
 
  on the curve. To a point 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  we associate the divisor 
 
 
 
 , in particular 
 
 
 
  in linked to the identity element 
 
 
 
 . In a straightforward fashion we can now relate an element of 
 
 
 
  to each point 
 
 
 
  by linking 
 
 
 
  to the class of 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 . Then the map 
 
 
 
  from the group of points on 
 
 
 
  to the Jacobian of 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  is a group homomorphism. This can be shown by looking at three points on 
 
 
 
  adding up to 
 
 
 
 , i.e. we take 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . We now relate the addition law on the Jacobian to the geometric group law on elliptic curves. Adding 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  geometrically means drawing a straight line through 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , this line intersects the curve in one other point. We then define 
 
 
 
  as the opposite of this point. Hence in the case 
 
 
 
  we have that these three points are collinear, thus there is some linear 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  satisfy 
 
 
 
 . Now, 
 
 
 
  which is the identity element of 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  is the divisor on the rational function 
 
 
 
  and thus it is a principal divisor. We conclude that 
 
 
 
 .
The Abel-Jacobi theorem states that a divisor 
 
 
 
  is principal if and only if 
 
 
 
  has degree 0 and 
 
 
 
  under the usual addition law for points on cubic curves. As two divisors 
 
 
 
  are equivalent if and only if 
 
 
 
  is principal, we conclude that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are equivalent if and only if 
 
 
 
 . Now, every nontrivial divisor of degree 0 is equivalent to a divisor of the form 
 
 
 
 , this implies that we have found a way to ascribe a point on 
 
 
 
  to every class 
 
 
 
 . Namely, to 
 
 
 
  we ascribe the point 
 
 
 
 . This maps extends to the neutral element 0 which is maped to 
 
 
 
 . As such the map 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  is the inverse of 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
  is in fact a group isomorphism, proving that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic.
The Jacobian of a hyperelliptic curve
The general hyperelliptic case is a bit more complicated. Consider a hyperelliptic curve 
 
 
 
  of genus 
 
 
 
  over a field 
 
 
 
 . A divisor 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is called reduced if it has the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . Note that a reduced divisor always has degree 0, also it is possible that 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 , but only if 
 
 
 
  is not a Weierstrass point. It can be proven that for each divisor 
 
 
 
  there is a unique reduced divisor 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to 
 
 
 
 .4 Hence every class of the quotient group 
 
 
 
  has precisely one reduced divisor. Instead of looking at 
 
 
 
  we can thus look at the set of all reduced divisors.
Reduced divisors and their Mumford representation
A convenient way to look at reduced divisors is via their Mumford representation. A divisor in this representation consists of a pair of polynomials 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is monic, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Every non-trivial reduced divisor can be represented by a unique pair of such polynomials. This can be seen by factoring 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  which can be done as such as 
 
 
 
  is monic. The last condition on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then implies that the point 
 
 
 
  lies on 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is a divisor and in fact it can be shown to be a reduced divisor. For example the condition 
 
 
 
  ensures that 
 
 
 
 . This gives the 1-1 correspondence between reduced divisors and divisors in Mumford representation. As an example, 
 
 
 
  is the unique reduced divisor belonging to the identity element of 
 
 
 
 . Its Mumford representation is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Going back and forth between reduced divisors and their Mumford representation is now an easy task. For example consider the hyperelliptic curve 
 
 
 
  of genus 2 over the real numbers. We can find the following points on the curve 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then we can define reduced divisors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The Mumford representation of 
 
 
 
  consists of polynomials 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and we know that the first coordinates of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 1 and 3, must be zeroes of 
 
 
 
 . Hence we have 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  it must be the case that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
  has degree 1. There is exactly one polynomial of degree 1 with these properties, namely 
 
 
 
 . Thus the Mumford representation of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . In a similar fashion we can find the Mumford representation 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If a point 
 
 
 
  appears with multiplicity n, the polynomial v needs to satisfy 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Cantor's algorithm
There is an algorithm which takes two reduced divisors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in their Mumford representation and produces the unique reduced divisor 
 
 
 
 , again in its Mumford representation, such that 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to 
 
 
 
 .5 As every element of the Jacobian can be represented by the one reduced divisor it contains, the algorithm allows to perform the group operation on these reduced divisors given in their Mumford representation. The algorithm was originally developed by David G. Cantor (not to be confused with Georg Cantor), explaining the name of the algorithm. Cantor only looked at the case 
 
 
 
 , the general case is due to Koblitz. The input is two reduced divisors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in their Mumford representation of the hyperelliptic curve 
 
 
 
  of genus 
 
 
 
  over the field 
 
 
 
 . The algorithm works as follows

Using the extended Euclidean algorithm compute the polynomials 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Again with the use of the extended Euclidean algorithm compute the polynomials 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Put 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , which gives 
 
 
 
 .
Set 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Set 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , then set 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and repeat step 5 until 
 
 
 
 .
Make 
 
 
 
  monic by dividing through its leading coefficient.
Output 
 
 
 
 .

The proof that the algorithm is correct can be found in .6
Example
As an example consider the curve



of genus 2 over the real numbers. For the points


 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and the reduced divisors


 
  and 
 
 
 
  we know that

  respectively.
We can compute their sum using Cantor's algorithm. We begin by computing

 .
In the second step we find


 
  and


 
  for

 .
Now we can compute

Lastly we find


 
  and


 
 . After making 
 
 
 
  monic we conclude that


 
  is equivalent to

More on Cantor's algorithm
Cantor's algorithm as presented here has a general form, it holds for hyperelliptic curves of any genus and over any field. However, the algorithm is not very efficient. For example, it requires the use of the extended Euclidean algorithm. If we fix the genus of the curve or the characteristic of the field (or both), we can make the algorithm more efficient. For some special cases we even get explicit addition and doubling formulas which are very fast. For example, there are explicit formulas for hyperelliptic curves of genus 27 8 and genus 3.
For hyperelliptic curves it is also fairly easy to visualize the adding of two reduced divisors. Suppose we have a hyperelliptic curve of genus 2 over the real numbers of the form


 
  and two reduced divisors


 
  and


 
 . Assume that


 
 , this case has to be treated separately. There is exactly 1 cubic polynomial


 
  going through the four points


 
 . Note here that it could be possible that for example 
 
 
 
 , hence we must take multiplicities into account. Putting 
 
 
 
  we find that


 
  and hence


 
 . As 
 
 
 
  is a polynomial of degree 6, we have that 
 
 
 
  has six zeroes and hence 
 
 
 
  has besides 
 
 
 
  two more intersection points with 
 
 
 
 , call them 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 . Now, 
 
 
 
  are intersection points of 
 
 
 
  with an algebraic curve. As such we know that the divisor


 
  is principal which implies that the divisor


 
  is equivalent to the divisor


 
 . Furthermore the divisor


 
  is principal for every point 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  as it comes from the rational function 
 
 
 
 . This gives that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are equivalent. Combining these two properties we conclude that


 
  is equivalent to the reduced divisor


 
 . In a picture this looks like Figure 2. It is possible to explicitly compute the coefficients of 
 
 
 
 , in this way we can arrive at explicit formulas for adding two reduced divisors.
