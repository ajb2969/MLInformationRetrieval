   Roy's safety-first criterion      Roy's safety-first criterion   Roy's safety-first criterion is a risk management technique that allows an investor to select one portfolio rather than another based on the criterion that the probability of the portfolio's return falling below a minimum desired threshold is minimized. 1  For example, suppose there are two available investment strategies - portfolio A and portfolio B, and suppose the investor's threshold return level (the minimum return that the investor is willing to tolerate) is -1%. then the investor would choose the portfolio that would provide the maximum probability of the portfolio return being at least as high as −1%.  Thus, the problem of an investor using Roy's safety criterion can be summarized symbolically as:    $\underset{i}{\min}\Pr(R_{i}<\underline{R})$      where $\Pr(R_{i}<\underline{R})$ is the probability of $R_{i}$ (the actual return of asset i) being less than $\underline{R}$ (the minimum acceptable return).  Normally distributed return and SFRatio  If the portfolios under consideration have normally distributed returns, Roy's safety-first criterion can be reduced to the maximization of the safety-first ratio, defined by:    $\text{SFRatio}_{i}=\frac{\text{E}(R_{i})-\underline{R}}{\sqrt{\text{Var}(R_{i})}}$      where $\text{E}(R_{i})$ is the expected return (the mean return) of the portfolio, $\sqrt{\text{Var}(R_{i})}$ is the standard deviation of the portfolio's return and $\underline{R}$ is the minimum acceptable return.  Example  If Portfolio A has an expected return of 10% and standard deviation of 15%, while portfolio B has a mean return of 8% and a standard deviation of 5%, and the investor is willing to invest in a portfolio that maximizes the probability of a return no lower than 0%:   SFRatio(A) = [10 − 0]/15 = 0.67,  SFRatio(B) = [8 − 0]/5 = 1.6   By Roy's safety-first criterion, the investor would choose portfolio B as the correct investment opportunity.  Similarity to Sharpe ratio  Under normality,  $$\text{SFRatio} =\frac{\text{ Expected Return - Minimum Return}}{\text{standard deviation of Return}}.$$  The Sharpe ratio is defined as excess return per unit of risk, or in other words:  $$\text{Sharpe ratio} =\frac{\text{ Expected Return - Risk-Free Return}}{\text{standard deviation of (Return - Risk-Free Return)}}$$ .  The SFRatio has a striking similarity to the Sharpe ratio. Thus for normally distributed returns, Roy's Safety-first criterion—with the minimum acceptable return equal to the risk-free rate—provides the same conclusions about which portfolio to invest in as if we were picking the one with the maximum Sharpe ratio.
