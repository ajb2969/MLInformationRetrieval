   (S)-usnate reductase      (S)-usnate reductase   In enzymology , a ( S )-usnate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (6 R )-2-acetyl-6-(3-acetyl-2,4,6-trihydroxy-5-methylphenyl)-3-hydroxy-6- methyl-2,4-cyclohexadien-1-one + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ( S )-usnic acid + NADH + H +    In the reverse direction, ( S )-usnate is reduced by NADH with cleavage of the ether bond to form a 7-hydroxy group.  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is reduced-( S )-usnate:NAD + oxidoreductase (ether-bond-forming) . This enzyme is also called L-usnic acid dehydrogenase .
