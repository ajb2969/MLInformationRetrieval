   Willmore energy      Willmore energy   In differential geometry , the Willmore energy is a quantitative measure of how much a given surface deviates from a round sphere . Mathematically, the Willmore energy of a smooth  closed surface  embedded in three-dimensional Euclidean space is defined to be the integral of the square of the mean curvature minus the Gaussian curvature . It is named after the English geometer Thomas Willmore .  Definition  Expressed symbolically, the Willmore energy of S is:      𝒲  =     ∫  S      H  2    d  A    -    ∫  S     K   d  A         𝒲      subscript   S      superscript  H  2   d  A      subscript   S     K  d  A       \mathcal{W}=\int_{S}H^{2}\,dA-\int_{S}K\,dA     where   H   H   H   is the mean curvature ,   K   K   K   is the Gaussian curvature , and dA is the area form of S . For a closed surface, by the Gauss–Bonnet theorem , the integral of the Gaussian curvature may be computed in terms of the Euler characteristic     χ   (  S  )       χ  S    \chi(S)   of the surface, so         ∫  S     K   d  A    =   2  π  χ   (  S  )     ,        subscript   S     K  d  A      2  π  χ  S     \int_{S}K\,dA=2\pi\chi(S),     which is a topological invariant and thus independent of the particular embedding in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   that was chosen. Thus the Willmore energy can be expressed as      𝒲  =     ∫  S      H  2    d  A    -   2  π  χ   (  S  )         𝒲      subscript   S      superscript  H  2   d  A      2  π  χ  S      \mathcal{W}=\int_{S}H^{2}\,dA-2\pi\chi(S)     An alternative, but equivalent, formula is      𝒲  =    1  4     ∫  S       (    k  1   -   k  2    )   2    d  A         𝒲      1  4     subscript   S      superscript     subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2    2   d  A       \mathcal{W}={1\over 4}\int_{S}(k_{1}-k_{2})^{2}\,dA     where    k  1     subscript  k  1    k_{1}   and    k  2     subscript  k  2    k_{2}   are the principal curvatures of the surface.  Properties  The Willmore energy is always greater than or equal to zero. A round sphere has zero Willmore energy.  The Willmore energy can be considered a functional on the space of embeddings of a given surface, in the sense of the calculus of variations , and one can vary the embedding of a surface, while leaving it topologically unaltered.  Critical points  A basic problem in the calculus of variations is to find the critical points and minima of a functional.  For a given topological space, this is equivalent to finding the critical points of the function       ∫  S      H  2    d  A       subscript   S      superscript  H  2   d  A     \int_{S}H^{2}\,dA   since the Euler characteristic is constant.  One can find (local) minima for the Willmore energy by gradient descent , which in this context is called Willmore flow .  For embeddings of the sphere in 3-space, the critical points have been classified: 1 they are all conformal transforms of minimal surfaces , the round sphere is the minimum, and all other critical values are integers greater than or equal to 4   π   π   \pi   .  Willmore flow  The Willmore flow is the geometric flow corresponding to the Willmore energy; it is an    L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   - gradient flow .       e   [  ℳ  ]    =    1  2     ∫  ℳ      H  2    d  A           e   delimited-[]  ℳ        1  2     subscript   ℳ      superscript  H  2   normal-d  A       e[{\mathcal{M}}]=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathcal{M}}H^{2}\,\mathrm{d}A     where H stands for the mean curvature of the manifold    ℳ   ℳ   \mathcal{M}   .  Flow lines satisfy the differential equation:         ∂  t   x    (  t  )    =   -    ∇  𝒲    [   x   (  t  )    ]             subscript   t   x   t        normal-∇  𝒲    delimited-[]    x  t        \partial_{t}x(t)=-\nabla\mathcal{W}[x(t)]\,   where   x   x   x   is a point belonging to the surface.  This flow leads to an evolution problem in differential geometry : the surface   ℳ   ℳ   \mathcal{M}   is evolving in time to follow variations of steepest descent of the energy. Like surface diffusion it is a fourth-order flow, since the variation of the energy contains fourth derivatives.  Applications   Cell membranes tend to position themselves so as to minimize Willmore energy.    Willmore energy is used in constructing a class of optimal sphere eversions , the minimax eversions .
