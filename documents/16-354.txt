   Slice theorem (differential geometry)      Slice theorem (differential geometry)   In differential geometry , the slice theorem states: 1 given a manifold  M on which a Lie group  G  acts as diffeomorphisms , for any x in M , the map      G  /   G  x    →  M   ,    [  g  ]   ↦   g  ⋅  x       formulae-sequence   normal-→    G   subscript  G  x    M    maps-to   delimited-[]  g    normal-⋅  g  x      G/G_{x}\to M,\,[g]\mapsto g\cdot x   extends to an invariant neighborhood of    G  /   G  x       G   subscript  G  x     G/G_{x}   (viewed as a zero section) in       G   ×   G  x     T  x    M   /   T  x     (   G  ⋅  x   )             subscript    subscript  G  x    G   subscript  T  x    M    subscript  T  x     normal-⋅  G  x     G\times_{G_{x}}T_{x}M/T_{x}(G\cdot x)   so that it defines an equivariant diffeomorphism from the neighborhood to its image, which contains the orbit of x .  The important application of the theorem is a proof of the fact that the quotient    M  /  G      M  G    M/G   admits a manifold structure when G is compact and the action is free.  In algebraic geometry , there is an analog of the slice theorem; it is called the Luna's slice theorem .  Idea of proof when G is compact  Since G is compact, there exists an invariant metric; i.e., G acts as isometries . One then adopts the usual proof of the existence of a tubular neighborhood using this metric.
