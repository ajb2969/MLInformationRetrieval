Slice theorem (differential geometry)

In differential geometry, the slice theorem states:1 given a manifold M on which a Lie group G acts as diffeomorphisms, for any x in M, the map 
 
 
 
  extends to an invariant neighborhood of 
 
 
 
  (viewed as a zero section) in 
 
 
 
  so that it defines an equivariant diffeomorphism from the neighborhood to its image, which contains the orbit of x.
The important application of the theorem is a proof of the fact that the quotient 
 
 
 
  admits a manifold structure when G is compact and the action is free.
In algebraic geometry, there is an analog of the slice theorem; it is called the Luna's slice theorem.
Idea of proof when G is compact
Since G is compact, there exists an invariant metric; i.e., G acts as isometries. One then adopts the usual proof of the existence of a tubular neighborhood using this metric.
