   Pompeiu's theorem      Pompeiu's theorem     Pompeiu's theorem is a result of plane geometry , discovered by the Romanian mathematician Dimitrie Pompeiu . The theorem is quite simple, but not classical. It states the following:   Given an equilateral triangle ABC in the plane, and a point P in the plane of the triangle ABC, the lengths PA, PB, and PC form the sides of a (maybe, degenerate) triangle.    The proof is quick. Consider a rotation of 60° about the point C . Assume A maps to B , and P maps to P '. Then we have     P   C    =    P  ′   C         P  C      superscript  P  normal-′   C     \scriptstyle PC\ =\ P^{\prime}C   , and     ∠  P  C    P  ′     =   60  ∘         normal-∠  P  C   superscript  P  normal-′     superscript  60      \scriptstyle\angle PCP^{\prime}\ =\ 60^{\circ}   . Hence triangle PCP ' is equilateral and     P    P  ′     =   P  C         P   superscript  P  normal-′      P  C     \scriptstyle PP^{\prime}\ =\ PC   . It is obvious that     P   A    =    P  ′   B         P  A      superscript  P  normal-′   B     \scriptstyle PA\ =\ P^{\prime}B   . Thus, triangle PBP ' has sides equal to PA , PB , and PC and the proof by construction is complete.  Further investigations reveal that if P is not in the interior of the triangle, but rather on the circumcircle , then PA , PB , PC form a degenerate triangle, with the largest being equal to the sum of the others.
