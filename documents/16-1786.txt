   Draft:Graph Sparsification      Draft:Graph Sparsification   Given a graph, sparsification is the problem of constructing another graph with fewer number of edges or nodes such that certain properties of the original graph are approximately preserved. This can be used to dramatically speed up graph algorithms while incurring only a small error in the final answer  Two types of sparsification have been studied:  1. Spectrum-preserving Sparsification : Let    L  G     subscript  L  G    L_{G}   be the Laplacian of the graph   G   G   G   . Then a graph H is said is an   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   approximation of   G   G   G   if      (   1  -  ϵ   )    x  t    L  H   x   ≤    x  t    L  G   x   ≤    (   1  -  ϵ   )    x  t    L  H   x             1  ϵ    superscript  x  t    subscript  L  H   x      superscript  x  t    subscript  L  G   x            1  ϵ    superscript  x  t    subscript  L  H   x      (1-\epsilon)x^{t}L_{H}x\leq x^{t}L_{G}x\leq(1-\epsilon)x^{t}L_{H}x   for all   x   x   x   . The aim in spectrum preserving sparsification is to produce a graph   H   H   H   which is an   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   approximation of   G   G   G   , but has fewer number of edges.  2. Cut-preserving Sparsification : A cut is a partition of vertices of a graph into two disjoint sets. Value of the cut is the sum of all the edges that cross between these two sets. Cut preserving sparsification aims to find a new graph with lesser number of edges, but all graph where cut values are preserved approximately.
