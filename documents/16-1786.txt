Draft:Graph Sparsification

Given a graph, sparsification is the problem of constructing another graph with fewer number of edges or nodes such that certain properties of the original graph are approximately preserved. This can be used to dramatically speed up graph algorithms while incurring only a small error in the final answer
Two types of sparsification have been studied:
1. Spectrum-preserving Sparsification : Let 
 
 
 
  be the Laplacian of the graph 
 
 
 
 . Then a graph H is said is an 
 
 
 
  approximation of 
 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . The aim in spectrum preserving sparsification is to produce a graph 
 
 
 
  which is an 
 
 
 
  approximation of 
 
 
 
 
 , but has fewer number of edges.
2. Cut-preserving Sparsification : A cut is a partition of vertices of a graph into two disjoint sets. Value of the cut is the sum of all the edges that cross between these two sets. Cut preserving sparsification aims to find a new graph with lesser number of edges, but all graph where cut values are preserved approximately.
