   Algebraic solution      Algebraic solution   An algebraic solution or solution in radicals is a closed form expression , and more specifically a closed-form algebraic expression , that is the solution of an algebraic equation in terms of the coefficients, relying only on addition , subtraction , multiplication , division , raising to integer powers, and the extraction of nth roots (square roots, cube roots, and other integer roots).  The most well-known example is the solution       x  =     -  b   ±     b  2   -   4  a   c        2  a     ,      x     plus-or-minus    b        superscript  b  2     4  a  c        2  a      x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac\ }}{2a},     introduced in secondary school, of the quadratic equation        a   x  2    +   b  x   +  c   =   0           a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c   0    ax^{2}+bx+c=0\,     (where a ≠ 0).  There exist more complicated algebraic solutions for the general cubic equation 1 and quartic equation . 2 The Abel-Ruffini theorem 3 states that the general quintic equation lacks an algebraic solution, and this directly implies that the general polynomial equation of degree n , for n ≥ 5, cannot be solved algebraically. However, under certain conditions algebraic solutions can be obtained; for example, the equation     x  10   =  a       superscript  x  10   a    x^{10}=a   can be solved as     x  =   a   1  /  10     .      x   superscript  a    1  10      x=a^{1/10}.     Évariste Galois introduced a criterion allowing to decide which equations are solvable in radicals. See Radical extension for the precise formulation of his result.  Algebraic solutions form a subset of closed-form expressions , because the latter permit transcendental functions (non-algebraic functions) such as the exponential function, the logarithmic function, and the trigonometric functions and their inverses.
