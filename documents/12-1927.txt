   Gordon‚ÄìNewell theorem      Gordon‚ÄìNewell theorem   In queueing theory , a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability , the Gordon‚ÄìNewell theorem is an extension of Jackson's theorem from open queueing networks to closed queueing networks of exponential servers where customers cannot leave the network. 1 Jackson's theorem cannot be applied to closed networks because the queue length at a node in the closed network is limited by the population of the network. The Gordon‚ÄìNewell theorem calculates the open network solution and then eliminates the infeasible states by renormalizing the probabilities. Calculation of the normalizing constant makes the treatment more awkward as the whole state space must be enumerated. Buzen's algorithm or mean value analysis can be used to calculate the normalizing constant more efficiently. 2  Definition of a Gordon‚ÄìNewell network  A network of m interconnected queues is known as a Gordon‚ÄìNewell network 3 or closed Jackson network 4 if it meets the following conditions:   the network is closed (no customers can enter or leave the network),  all service times are exponentially distributed and the service discipline at all queues is FCFS ,  a customer completing service at queue i will move to queue j with probability    P   i  j      subscript  P    i  j     P_{ij}   , with the    P   i  j      subscript  P    i  j     P_{ij}   such that      ‚àë   j  =  1   m    P   i  j     =  1        superscript   subscript     j  1    m    subscript  P    i  j     1    \scriptstyle{\sum_{j=1}^{m}P_{ij}=1}   ,  the utilization of all of the queues is less than one.   Theorem  In a closed Gordon‚ÄìNewell network of m queues, with a total population of K individuals, write    (   k  1   ,   k  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   k  m   )      subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  k  m     \scriptstyle{(k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{m})}   (where k i is the length of queue i ) for the state of the network and S ( K , m ) for the state space      S   (  K  ,  m  )   =   {  ùê§  ‚àà   ‚Ñ§  m   such that   ‚àë   i  =  1   m    k  i   =  K  and   k  i   ‚â•  0  ‚àÄ  i  }   .     fragments  S   fragments  normal-(  K  normal-,  m  normal-)     fragments  normal-{  k    superscript  ‚Ñ§  m   such that   superscript   subscript     i  1    m    subscript  k  i    K  and   subscript  k  i    0   for-all  i  normal-}   normal-.    S(K,m)=\left\{\mathbf{k}\in\mathbb{Z}^{m}\text{ such that }\sum_{i=1}^{m}k_{i}%
 =K\text{ and }k_{i}\geq 0\quad\forall i\right\}.     Then the equilibrium state probability distribution exists and is given by       œÄ   (   k  1   ,   k  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   k  m   )    =    1   G   (  K  )       ‚àè   i  =  1   m     (    e  i    Œº  i    )    k  i            œÄ    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  k  m         1    G  K      superscript   subscript  product    i  1    m    superscript     subscript  e  i    subscript  Œº  i     subscript  k  i        \pi(k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{m})=\frac{1}{G(K)}\prod_{i=1}^{m}\left(\frac{e_{i}}{%
 \mu_{i}}\right)^{k_{i}}     where service times at queue i are exponentially distributed with parameter Œº i . The normalizing constant G ( K ) is given by        G   (  K  )    =    ‚àë   ùê§  ‚àà   S   (  K  ,  m  )        ‚àè   i  =  1   m     (    e  i    Œº  i    )    k  i       ,        G  K     subscript     ùê§    S   K  m        superscript   subscript  product    i  1    m    superscript     subscript  e  i    subscript  Œº  i     subscript  k  i        G(K)=\sum_{\mathbf{k}\in S(K,m)}\prod_{i=1}^{m}\left(\frac{e_{i}}{\mu_{i}}%
 \right)^{k_{i}},     and e i is the visit ratio, calculated by solving the simultaneous equations        e  i   =    ‚àë   j  =  1   m     e  j    p   j  i    for  1    ‚â§  i  ‚â§  m   .         subscript  e  i     superscript   subscript     j  1    m      subscript  e  j    subscript  p    j  i    for  1         i       m     e_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}e_{j}p_{ji}\text{ for }1\leq i\leq m.\,     See also   BCMP network   References  "  Category:Stochastic processes  Category:Probability theorems  Category:Queueing theory     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©
