Brazilian cruzeiro real

The cruzeiro real (
 
 
 
 , plural: cruzeiros reais) was the short-lived currency of Brazil between August 1, 1993 and June 30, 1994. It was subdivided in 100 centavos, however, this unit was used only for accounting purposes. The currency had the ISO 4217 code BRR.
The cruzeiro real was replaced with the current Brazilian real as part of the Plano Real.
History
The cruzeiro real replaced the third cruzeiro, with 1000 cruzeiros = 1 cruzeiro real. The cruzeiro real was replaced in circulation by the real at a rate of 1 real for 2750 cruzeiros reais. Before this occurred, the unidade real de valor (pegged to the U.S. dollar at parity) was used in pricing, to allow the population to become accustomed to a stable currency (after many years of high inflation) before the real was introduced.
Coins
Stainless-steel coins were issued in 1993 and 1994 in denominations of 5, 10, 50 and 100 cruzeiros reais.
Banknotes
 In 1993, provisional banknotes were introduced in the form of cruzeiro notes overprinted in the new currency. These were in denominations of 50, 100 and 500 cruzeiros reais. Regular notes followed in denominations of 1000, 5000 and 50000 cruzeiros reais.
