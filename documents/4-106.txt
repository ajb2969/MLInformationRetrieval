   Second fundamental form      Second fundamental form   In differential geometry , the second fundamental form (or shape tensor ) is a quadratic form on the tangent plane of a smooth surface in the three-dimensional Euclidean space , usually denoted by     I   I      normal-I  normal-I    \mathrm{I\!I}   (read "two"). Together with the first fundamental form , it serves to define extrinsic invariants of the surface, its principal curvatures . More generally, such a quadratic form is defined for a smooth hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold and a smooth choice of the unit normal vector at each point.  Surface in R 3  Motivation  The second fundamental form of a parametric surface  S in R 3 was introduced and studied by Gauss . First suppose that the surface is the graph of a twice continuously differentiable function, z = f ( x , y ), and that the plane z = 0 is tangent to the surface at the origin. Then f and its partial derivatives with respect to x and y vanish at (0,0). Therefore, the Taylor expansion of f at (0,0) starts with quadratic terms:       z  =    L    x  2   2    +   M  x  y   +   N    y  2   2    +    higher    order   terms     ,      z      L     superscript  x  2   2      M  x  y     N     superscript  y  2   2      higher  order  terms      z=L\frac{x^{2}}{2}+Mxy+N\frac{y^{2}}{2}+\mathrm{\scriptstyle{{\ }higher{\ }%
 order{\ }terms}},     and the second fundamental form at the origin in the coordinates x , y is the quadratic form         L   d   x  2    +   2   M   d   x   d  y   +    N   d   y  2     .        L  d   superscript  x  2      2  M  d  x  d  y     N  d   superscript  y  2      L\,\text{d}x^{2}+2M\,\text{d}x\,\text{d}y+N\,\text{d}y^{2}.\,     For a smooth point P on S , one can choose the coordinate system so that the coordinate z -plane is tangent to S at P and define the second fundamental form in the same way.  Classical notation  The second fundamental form of a general parametric surface is defined as follows. Let  be a regular parametrization of a surface in R 3 , where r is a smooth vector valued function of two variables. It is common to denote the partial derivatives of r with respect to u and v by r u and r v . Regularity of the parametrization means that r u and r v are linearly independent for any ( u , v ) in the domain of r , and hence span the tangent plane to S at each point. Equivalently, the cross product  r u × r v is a nonzero vector normal to the surface. The parametrization thus defines a field of unit normal vectors n :       𝐧  =     𝐫  u   ×   𝐫  v     |    𝐫  u   ×   𝐫  v    |     .      𝐧       subscript  𝐫  u    subscript  𝐫  v         subscript  𝐫  u    subscript  𝐫  v        \mathbf{n}=\frac{\mathbf{r}_{u}\times\mathbf{r}_{v}}{|\mathbf{r}_{u}\times%
 \mathbf{r}_{v}|}.     The second fundamental form is usually written as         I   I   =     L   d   u  2    +   2   M   d   u   d  v   +    N   d   v  2      ,        normal-I  normal-I       L  d   superscript  u  2      2  M  d  u  d  v     N  d   superscript  v  2       \mathrm{I\!I}=L\,\text{d}u^{2}+2M\,\text{d}u\,\text{d}v+N\,\text{d}v^{2},\,     its matrix in the basis { r u , r v } of the tangent plane is       [     L     M  ;       M     N  ;      ]   .      L  M    M  N     \begin{bmatrix}L&M\\
 M&N\end{bmatrix}.     The coefficients L , M , N at a given point in the parametric uv -plane are given by the projections of the second partial derivatives of r at that point onto the normal line to S and can be computed with the aid of the dot product as follows:        L  =    𝐫   u  u    ⋅  𝐧    ,    M  =    𝐫   u  v    ⋅  𝐧    ,   N  =    𝐫   v  v    ⋅  𝐧      .     formulae-sequence    L   normal-⋅   subscript  𝐫    u  u    𝐧     formulae-sequence    M   normal-⋅   subscript  𝐫    u  v    𝐧      N   normal-⋅   subscript  𝐫    v  v    𝐧       L=\mathbf{r}_{uu}\cdot\mathbf{n},\quad M=\mathbf{r}_{uv}\cdot\mathbf{n},\quad N%
 =\mathbf{r}_{vv}\cdot\mathbf{n}.     Physicist's notation  The second fundamental form of a general parametric surface S is defined as follows: Let r = r ( u 1 , u 2 ) be a regular parametrization of a surface in R 3 , where r is a smooth vector valued function of two variables. It is common to denote the partial derivatives of r with respect to u α by r α , α = 1, 2. Regularity of the parametrization means that r 1 and r 2 are linearly independent for any ( u 1 , u 2 ) in the domain of r , and hence span the tangent plane to S at each point. Equivalently, the cross product  r 1 × r 2 is a nonzero vector normal to the surface. The parametrization thus defines a field of unit normal vectors n :       𝐧  =     𝐫  1   ×   𝐫  2     |    𝐫  1   ×   𝐫  2    |     .      𝐧       subscript  𝐫  1    subscript  𝐫  2         subscript  𝐫  1    subscript  𝐫  2        \mathbf{n}=\frac{\mathbf{r}_{1}\times\mathbf{r}_{2}}{|\mathbf{r}_{1}\times%
 \mathbf{r}_{2}|}.     The second fundamental form is usually written as         I   I   =     b   α  β     d    u  α    d   u  β     .        normal-I  normal-I      subscript  b    α  β    d   superscript  u  α   d   superscript  u  β      \mathrm{I\!I}=b_{\alpha\beta}\,\text{d}u^{\alpha}\,\text{d}u^{\beta}.\,     The equation above uses the Einstein Summation Convention . The coefficients b αβ at a given point in the parametric ( u 1 , u 2 )-plane are given by the projections of the second partial derivatives of r at that point onto the normal line to S and can be computed in terms of the normal vector "n" as follows:        b   α  β    =    r   α  β    γ     n  γ     .       subscript  b    α  β       superscript   subscript  r    α  β    γ    subscript  n  γ      b_{\alpha\beta}=r_{\alpha\beta}^{\ \ \gamma}n_{\gamma}.     Hypersurface in a Riemannian manifold  In Euclidean space , the second fundamental form is given by        I   I   (  v  ,  w  )    =   -    ⟨   d  ν   (  v  )    ,  w  ⟩   ν          normal-I  normal-I   v  w           d  ν  v   w   ν      \mathrm{I\!I}(v,w)=-\langle d\nu(v),w\rangle\nu     where   ν   ν   \nu   is the Gauss map , and    d  ν      d  ν    d\nu   the differential of   ν   ν   \nu   regarded as a vector valued differential form , and the brackets denote the metric tensor of Euclidean space.  More generally, on a Riemannian manifold, the second fundamental form is an equivalent way to describe the shape operator (denoted by   S   S   S   ) of a hypersurface,         I   I   (  v  ,  w  )    =    ⟨   S   (  v  )    ,  w  ⟩   n   =   -    ⟨    ∇  v   n   ,  w  ⟩   n    =    ⟨  n  ,    ∇  v   w   ⟩   n    ,          normal-I  normal-I   v  w         S  v   w   n               subscript  normal-∇  v   n   w   n            n    subscript  normal-∇  v   w    n      \mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{I}(v,w)=\langle S(v),w\rangle n=-\langle\nabla_{v}n,w%
 \rangle n=\langle n,\nabla_{v}w\rangle n,     where     ∇  v   w      subscript  normal-∇  v   w    \nabla_{v}w   denotes the covariant derivative of the ambient manifold and   n   n   n   a field of normal vectors on the hypersurface. (If the affine connection is torsion-free , then the second fundamental form is symmetric.)  The sign of the second fundamental form depends on the choice of direction of   n   n   n   (which is called a co-orientation of the hypersurface - for surfaces in Euclidean space, this is equivalently given by a choice of orientation of the surface).  Generalization to arbitrary codimension  The second fundamental form can be generalized to arbitrary codimension . In that case it is a quadratic form on the tangent space with values in the normal bundle and it can be defined by         I   I   (  v  ,  w  )    =    (    ∇  v   w   )   ⊥    ,        normal-I  normal-I   v  w     superscript    subscript  normal-∇  v   w   bottom     \mathrm{I\!I}(v,w)=(\nabla_{v}w)^{\bot},   where     (    ∇  v   w   )   ⊥     superscript    subscript  normal-∇  v   w   bottom    (\nabla_{v}w)^{\bot}   denotes the orthogonal projection of covariant derivative      ∇  v   w      subscript  normal-∇  v   w    \nabla_{v}w   onto the normal bundle.  In Euclidean space , the curvature tensor of a submanifold can be described by the following formula:        ⟨   R   (  u  ,  v  )   w   ,  z  ⟩   =    ⟨    I   I   (  u  ,  z  )    ,    I   I   (  v  ,  w  )    ⟩   -   ⟨    I   I   (  u  ,  w  )    ,    I   I   (  v  ,  z  )    ⟩     .         R   u  v   w   z        normal-I  normal-I   u  z      normal-I  normal-I   v  w        normal-I  normal-I   u  w      normal-I  normal-I   v  z        \langle R(u,v)w,z\rangle=\langle\mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{I}(u,z),\mathrm{I}\!%
 \mathrm{I}(v,w)\rangle-\langle\mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{I}(u,w),\mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{%
 I}(v,z)\rangle.   This is called the Gauss equation , as it may be viewed as a generalization of Gauss's Theorema Egregium .  For general Riemannian manifolds one has to add the curvature of ambient space; if   N   N   N   is a manifold embedded in a Riemannian manifold (    M  ,  g     M  g    M,g   ) then the curvature tensor    R  N     subscript  R  N    R_{N}   of   N   N   N   with induced metric can be expressed using the second fundamental form and    R  M     subscript  R  M    R_{M}   , the curvature tensor of   M   M   M   :        ⟨    R  N    (  u  ,  v  )   w   ,  z  ⟩   =     ⟨    R  M    (  u  ,  v  )   w   ,  z  ⟩   +   ⟨    I   I   (  u  ,  z  )    ,    I   I   (  v  ,  w  )    ⟩    -   ⟨    I   I   (  u  ,  w  )    ,    I   I   (  v  ,  z  )    ⟩     .          subscript  R  N    u  v   w   z           subscript  R  M    u  v   w   z      normal-I  normal-I   u  z      normal-I  normal-I   v  w         normal-I  normal-I   u  w      normal-I  normal-I   v  z        \langle R_{N}(u,v)w,z\rangle=\langle R_{M}(u,v)w,z\rangle+\langle\mathrm{I}\!%
 \mathrm{I}(u,z),\mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{I}(v,w)\rangle-\langle\mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{%
 I}(u,w),\mathrm{I}\!\mathrm{I}(v,z)\rangle.
