   Gliese 229      Gliese 229   Gliese 229 (also written as Gl 229 or GJ 229 ) is a red dwarf about 19 light years away in the constellation  Lepus . It has 58% of the mass of the Sun , 1 69% of the Sun's radius , 2 and a very low projected rotation velocity of 1 km/s at the stellar equator. 3  The star is known to be a low activity flare star , which means it undergoes random increases in luminosity because of magnetic activity at the surface. The spectrum shows emission lines of calcium in the H and K bands. The emission of X-rays has been detected from the corona of this star. 4 These may be caused by magnetic loops interacting with the gas of the star's outer atmosphere. No large-scale star spot activity has been detected. 5  The space velocity components of this star are U = +12, V = –11 and W = –12 km/s. 6 The orbit of this star through the Milky Way galaxy has an eccentricity of 0.07 and an orbital inclination of 0.005. 7  Distance          Substellar companions  A substellar companion was discovered in 1994 and confirmed in 1995 as Gliese 229B , 8 9 one of the first two instances of clear evidence for a brown dwarf , along with Teide 1 . Although too small to sustain hydrogen -burning nuclear fusion as in a main sequence star, with a mass of 20 to 50 times that of Jupiter (0.02 to 0.05 solar masses), it is still too massive to be a planet . As a brown dwarf, its core temperature is high enough to initiate the fusion of deuterium with a proton to form helium-3 , but it is thought that it used up all its deuterium fuel long ago. 10 This object now has a surface temperature of 950 K. 11  In March 2014, a super-Neptune mass planet candidate was announced in a much closer-in orbit around GJ 229 ( 12 ). Given the proximity to the Sun, the orbit of GJ 229b might be fully characterized by the Gaia space-astrometry mission or via direct imaging.  {{-}}  References  Notes  =4.83, the visual luminosity can be calculated by       L   V  ∗     L   V  ⊙      =   10   0.4   (    M   V  ⊙    -   M   V  ∗     )            subscript  L   subscript  V  normal-∗     subscript  L   subscript  V  direct-product      superscript  10    0.4     subscript  M   subscript  V  direct-product     subscript  M   subscript  V  normal-∗         \scriptstyle\frac{L_{V_{\ast}}}{L_{V_{\odot}}}=10^{0.4\left(M_{V_{\odot}}-M_{V%
