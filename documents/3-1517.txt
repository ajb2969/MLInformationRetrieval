Modus ponendo tollens

Modus ponendo tollens (Latin: "mode that by affirming, denies")1 is a valid rule of inference for propositional logic, sometimes abbreviated MPT.2 It is closely related to modus ponens and modus tollens. It is usually described as having the form:

Not both A and B
A
Therefore, not B

For example:

Ann and Bill cannot both win the race.
Ann won the race.
Therefore, Bill cannot have won the race.

As E.J. Lemmon describes it:"Modus ponendo tollens is the principle that, if the negation of a conjunction holds and also one of its conjuncts, then the negation of its other conjunct holds."3
In logic notation this can be represented as:











Based on the Sheffer Stroke (alternative denial), "|", the inference can also be formalized in this way:
