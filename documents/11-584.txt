   Monogenic system      Monogenic system   In classical mechanics , a physical system is termed a monogenic system if the force acting on the system can be modelled in an especially convenient mathematical form (see mathematical definition below). In physics , among the most studied physical systems are monogenic systems.  In Lagrangian mechanics , the property of being monogenic is a necessary condition for the equivalence of different formulations of principle. If a physical system is both a holonomic system and a monogenic system, then it is possible to derive Lagrange's equations from d'Alembert's principle ; it is also possible to derive Lagrange's equations from Hamilton's principle . 1  The term was introduced by Cornelius Lanczos in his book The Variational Principles of Mechanics (1970). 2 3  Monogenic systems have excellent mathematical characteristics and are well suited for mathematical analysis. Pedagogically, within the discipline of mechanics, it is considered a logical starting point for any serious physics endeavour.  Mathematical definition  In a physical system, if all forces, with the exception of the constraint forces, are derivable from the generalized scalar potential , and this generalized scalar potential is a function of generalized coordinates , generalized velocities , or time, then, this system is a monogenic system .  Expressed using equations, the exact relationship between generalized force     ‚Ñ±  i     subscript  ‚Ñ±  i    \mathcal{F}_{i}\,\!   and generalized potential    ùí±   (   q  1   ,   q  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   q  N   ,    q  Àô   1   ,    q  Àô   2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,    q  Àô   N   ,  t  )       ùí±    subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  q  N    subscript   normal-Àô  q   1    subscript   normal-Àô  q   2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript   normal-Àô  q   N   t     \mathcal{V}(q_{1},\ q_{2},\ \dots,\ q_{N},\ \dot{q}_{1},\ \dot{q}_{2},\ \dots,%

 \frac{\partial\mathcal{V}}{\partial\dot{q_{i}}}\right);\,     where    q  i     subscript  q  i    q_{i}\,\!   is generalized coordinate,      q  i   Àô      normal-Àô   subscript  q  i     \dot{q_{i}}\,   is generalized velocity, and   t   t   t\,\!   is time.  If the generalized potential in a monogenic system depends only on generalized coordinates, and not on generalized velocities and time, then, this system is a conservative system .The relationship between generalized force and generalized potential is as follows:         ‚Ñ±  i   =   -     ‚àÇ  ùí±    ‚àÇ   q  i            subscript  ‚Ñ±  i         ùí±      subscript  q  i        \mathcal{F}_{i}=-\frac{\partial\mathcal{V}}{\partial q_{i}}\,   Ôºõ     See also   Lagrangian mechanics  Hamiltonian mechanics  Holonomic system  Scleronomous   References  "  Category:Mechanics  Category:Classical mechanics  Category:Lagrangian mechanics  Category:Hamiltonian mechanics  Category:Dynamical systems     ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©  ‚Ü©
