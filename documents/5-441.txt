Mandelstam variables

 In theoretical physics, the Mandelstam variables are numerical quantities that encode the energy, momentum, and angles of particles in a scattering process in a Lorentz-invariant fashion. They are used for scattering processes of two particles to two particles. The Mandelstam variables were first introduced by physicist Stanley Mandelstam in 1958.
If the Minkowski Metric is chosen to be 
 
 
 
 , the Mandelstam variables 
 
 
 
  are then defined by

  Where p1 and p2 are the four-momenta of the incoming particles and p3 and p4 are the four-momenta of the outgoing particles, and we are using relativistic units (c=1).
s is also known as the square of the center-of-mass energy (invariant mass) and t is also known as the square of the four-momentum transfer.
Feynman diagrams
The letters 
 
 
 
  are also used in the terms s-channel (space-channel), t-channel (time-channel), u-channel. These channels represent different Feynman diagrams or different possible scattering events where the interaction involves the exchange of an intermediate particle whose squared four-momentum equals 
 
 
 
 , respectively.

The t-channel represents the process in which the particle 1 emits the intermediate particle and becomes the final particle 3, while the particle 2 absorbs the intermediate particle and becomes 4. The u-channel is the t-channel with the role of the particles 3,4 interchanged.

High-energy limit
In the relativistic limit rest mass can be neglected, so for example,








because 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  It is reminded that by relativistic limit one means that the momentum (speed) is so large that in the relativistic energy-momentum equation the energy becomes essentially the momentum norm (e.g. 
 
 
 
  becomes 
 
 
 
  ).

Proof
To prove this, we need to use two facts:
:*The square of a particle's four momentum is the square of its mass,
:
 
 

:*And conservation of four-momentum,











So, to begin,














Then adding the three while inserting squared masses leads to,








Then note that the last four terms add up to zero using conservation of four-momentum,








So finally,
