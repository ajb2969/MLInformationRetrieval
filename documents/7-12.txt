Overlapping interval topology

In mathematics, the overlapping interval topology is a topology which is used to illustrate various topological principles.
Definition
Given the closed interval

 
  of the real number line, the open sets of the topology are generated from the half-open intervals 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . The topology therefore consists of intervals of the form 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , together with 
 
 
 
  itself and the empty set.
Properties
Any two distinct points in 
 
 
 
  are topologically distinguishable under the overlapping interval topology as one can always find an open set containing one but not the other point. However, every non-empty open set contains the point 0 which can therefore not be separated from any other point in 
 
 
 
 , making 
 
 
 
  with the overlapping interval topology an example of a T0 space that is not a T1 space.
The overlapping interval topology is second countable, with a countable basis being given by the intervals 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and r and s rational (and thus countable).
