   Overlapping interval topology      Overlapping interval topology   In mathematics , the overlapping interval topology is a topology which is used to illustrate various topological principles.  Definition  Given the closed interval     [   -  1   ,  1  ]       1   1    [-1,1]   of the real number line , the open sets of the topology are generated from the half-open intervals    [   -  1   ,  b  )       1   b    [-1,b)   and    (  a  ,  1  ]     a  1    (a,1]   with    a  <  0  <  b        a  0       b     a<0   . The topology therefore consists of intervals of the form    [   -  1   ,  b  )       1   b    [-1,b)   ,    (  a  ,  b  )     a  b    (a,b)   , and    (  a  ,  1  ]     a  1    (a,1]   with    a  <  0  <  b        a  0       b     a<0   , together with    [   -  1   ,  1  ]       1   1    [-1,1]   itself and the empty set.  Properties  Any two distinct points in    [   -  1   ,  1  ]       1   1    [-1,1]   are topologically distinguishable under the overlapping interval topology as one can always find an open set containing one but not the other point. However, every non-empty open set contains the point 0 which can therefore not be separated from any other point in    [   -  1   ,  1  ]       1   1    [-1,1]   , making    [   -  1   ,  1  ]       1   1    [-1,1]   with the overlapping interval topology an example of a T0 space that is not a T1 space .  The overlapping interval topology is second countable , with a countable basis being given by the intervals    [   -  1   ,  s  )       1   s    [-1,s)   ,    (  r  ,  s  )     r  s    (r,s)   and    (  r  ,  1  ]     r  1    (r,1]   with    r  <  0  <  s        r  0       s     r<0   and r and s rational (and thus countable).
