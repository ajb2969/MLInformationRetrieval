Corydaline synthase




Corydaline synthase

In enzymology, a corydaline synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + palmatine + 2 NADPH + H+

 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + corydaline + 2 NADP+


The 4 substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine, palmatine, NADPH, and H+, whereas its 3 products are S-adenosylhomocysteine, corydaline, and NADP+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:protoberberine 13-C-methyltransferase.
