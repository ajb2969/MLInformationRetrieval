   TRNA (adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase      TRNA (adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase   TRNA (adenine 58 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, tRNA m1A58 methyltransferase , tRNA (m1A58) methyltransferase , TrmI , tRNA (m1A58) Mtase , Rv2118cp , Gcd10p-Gcd14p , Trm61p-Trm6p ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine 58 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 58 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 -methyladenine 58 in tRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates adenine 58 in tRNA.
