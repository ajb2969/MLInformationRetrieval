TRNA (adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase

TRNA (adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase (, tRNA m1A58 methyltransferase, tRNA (m1A58) methyltransferase, TrmI, tRNA (m1A58) Mtase, Rv2118cp, Gcd10p-Gcd14p, Trm61p-Trm6p) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine58-N1)-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine58 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methyladenine58 in tRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates adenine58 in tRNA.
