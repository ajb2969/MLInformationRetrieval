Entropy exchange

In quantum mechanics, and especially quantum information processing, the entropy exchange of a quantum operation

 
  acting on the density matrix

 
  of a system 
 
 
 
  is defined as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the von Neumann entropy of the system 
 
 
 
  and a fictitious purifying auxiliary system 
 
 
 
  after they are operated on by 
 
 
 
 . Here,
