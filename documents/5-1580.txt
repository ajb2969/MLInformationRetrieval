   Pro-p group      Pro-p group   In mathematics , a pro- p group (for some prime number  p ) is a profinite group    G   G   G   such that for any open  normal subgroup     N  ◁  G     normal-◁  N  G    N\triangleleft G   the quotient group     G  /  N      G  N    G/N   is a p -group . Note that, as profinite groups are compact , the open subgroups are exactly the closed subgroups of finite index , so that the discrete quotient group is always finite.  Alternatively, one can define a pro- p group to be the inverse limit of an inverse system of discrete finite p -groups.  The best-understood (and historically most important) class of pro- p groups is the p -adic analytic groups: groups with the structure of an analytic manifold over    ℚ  p     subscript  ℚ  p    \mathbb{Q}_{p}   such that group multiplication and inversion are both analytic functions. The work of Lubotzky and Mann, combined with Michel Lazard 's solution to Hilbert's fifth problem over the p -adic numbers, shows that a pro- p group is p -adic analytic if and only if it has finite rank , i.e. there exists a positive integer   r   r   r   such that any closed subgroup has a topological generating set with no more than   r   r   r   elements.  The Coclass Theorems have been proved in 1994 by A. Shalev and independently by C. R. Leedham-Green. Theorem D is one of these theorems and asserts that, for any prime number p and any positive integer r , there exist only finitely many pro- p groups of coclass r . This finiteness result is fundamental for the classification of finite p -groups by means of directed coclass graphs .  Examples   The canonical example is the p -adic integers           ℤ  p   =    lim  ←     ℤ  /   p  n    ℤ     .       subscript  ℤ  p     subscript   normal-←       ℤ   superscript  p  n    ℤ      \mathbb{Z}_{p}=\displaystyle\lim_{\leftarrow}\mathbb{Z}/p^{n}\mathbb{Z}.         The group     G    L  n    (   ℤ  p   )       G   subscript  L  n    subscript  ℤ  p     \ GL_{n}(\mathbb{Z}_{p})   of invertible n by n  matrices over     ℤ   p     subscript  ℤ  p    \ \mathbb{Z}_{p}   has an open subgroup U consisting of all matrices congruent to the identity matrix modulo     p    ℤ  p       p   subscript  ℤ  p     \ p\mathbb{Z}_{p}   . This U is a pro- p group. In fact the p -adic analytic groups mentioned above can all be found as closed subgroups of     G    L  n    (   ℤ  p   )       G   subscript  L  n    subscript  ℤ  p     \ GL_{n}(\mathbb{Z}_{p})   for some integer n ,  Any finite p -group is also a pro- p -group (with respect to the constant inverse system).
