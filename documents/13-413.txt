   Shriek map      Shriek map   In category theory , a branch of mathematics , certain unusual functors are denoted    f  !     subscript  f     f_{!}   and     f  !   ,     superscript  f     f^{!},   with the exclamation mark used to indicate that they are exceptional in some way. They are thus accordingly sometimes called shriek maps, with " shriek " being slang for an exclamation mark, though other terms are used, depending on context.  Usage  Shriek notation is used in two senses:   To distinguish a functor from a more usual functor    f  *     subscript  f     f_{*}   or     f  *   ,     superscript  f     f^{*},   accordingly as it is covariant or contravariant.  To indicate a map that goes "the wrong way" – a functor that has the same objects as a more familiar functor, but behaves differently on maps and has the opposite variance. For example, it has a pull-back where one expects a push-forward .   Examples  In algebraic geometry , these arise in image functors for sheaves , particularly Verdier duality , where    f  !     subscript  f     f_{!}   is a "less usual" functor.  In algebraic topology , these arise particularly in fiber bundles , where they yield maps that have the opposite of the usual variance. They are thus called wrong way maps,  Gysin maps, as they originated in the Gysin sequence , or transfer maps. A fiber bundle     F  →  E  →  B   ,       normal-→  F  E    normal-→    B     F\to E\to B,   with base space B, fiber F, and total space E, has, like any other continuous map of topological spaces, a covariant map on homology      H  *    (  E  )    →    H  *    (  B  )       normal-→     subscript  H    E      subscript  H    B     H_{*}(E)\to H_{*}(B)   and a contravariant map on cohomology       H  *    (  B  )    →    H  *    (  E  )     .     normal-→     superscript  H    B      superscript  H    E     H^{*}(B)\to H^{*}(E).   However, it also has a covariant map on cohomology, corresponding in de Rham cohomology to " integration along the fiber ", and a contravariant map on homology, corresponding in de Rham cohomology to "pointwise product with the fiber". The composition of the "wrong way" map with the usual map gives a map from the homology of the base to itself, analogous to a unit/ counit of an adjunction; compare also Galois connection .  These can be used in understanding and proving the product property for the Euler characteristic of a fiber bundle . 1  Notes  "  Category:Mathematical notation  Category:Algebraic geometry  Category:Algebraic topology     ↩
