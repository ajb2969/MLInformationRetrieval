   Alkylglycerophosphate 2-O-acetyltransferase      Alkylglycerophosphate 2-O-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , an alkylglycerophosphate 2-O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate , whereas its two products are CoA and 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate 2-O-acetyltransferase . This enzyme is also called alkyllyso-GP:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
