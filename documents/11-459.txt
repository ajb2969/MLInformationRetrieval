   Choloyl-CoA hydrolase      Choloyl-CoA hydrolase   In enzymology , a choloyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   choloyl-CoA + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cholate + CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are choloyl-CoA and H 2 O , whereas its two products are cholate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is choloyl-CoA hydrolase . Other names in common use include PTE-2 (ambiguous) , choloyl-coenzyme A thioesterase , chenodeoxycholoyl-coenzyme A thioesterase , and peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase 2 .
