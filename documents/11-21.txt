   UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase      UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an UDP-glucuronate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-D-glucuronate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP-D-xylose + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , UDP-D-glucuronate , and two products , UDP-D-xylose and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-glucuronate carboxy-lyase (UDP-D-xylose-forming) . Other names in common use include uridine-diphosphoglucuronate decarboxylase , and UDP-D-glucuronate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism and nucleotide sugars metabolism . It employs one cofactor , NAD+ .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
