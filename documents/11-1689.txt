   Trace identity      Trace identity   In mathematics , a trace identity is any equation involving the trace of a matrix .  Example  For example, the Cayley–Hamilton theorem says that every matrix satisfies its own characteristic polynomial .  Properties  Trace identities are invariant under simultaneous conjugation .  Uses  They are frequently used in the invariant theory of n × n matrices to find the generators and relations of the ring of invariants , and therefore are useful in answering questions similar to that posed by Hilbert's fourteenth problem .  Examples   By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem , all square matrices satisfy            tr   (   A  n   )    -   tr   (  A  )   tr   (   A   n  -  1    )     +  ⋯  +     (   -  1   )   n    det   (  A  )      =   0.             tr   superscript  A  n      tr  A  tr   superscript  A    n  1      normal-⋯     superscript    1   n     A     0.    {\rm tr}(A^{n})-{\rm tr}(A){\rm tr}(A^{n-1})+\cdots+(-1)^{n}\det(A)=0.\,         All square matrices satisfy           tr   (  A  )    =   tr   (   A  T   )     .        tr  A     tr   superscript  A  T      {\rm tr}(A)={\rm tr}(A^{\text{T}}).\,        References  .
