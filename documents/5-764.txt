   Hardy's theorem      Hardy's theorem   In mathematics , Hardy's theorem is a result in complex analysis describing the behavior of holomorphic functions .  Let   f   f   f   be a holomorphic function on the open ball centered at zero and radius   R   R   R   in the complex plane , and assume that   f   f   f   is not a constant function . If one defines       I   (  r  )    =    1   2  π       ∫  0   2  π       |   f   (   r   e   i  θ     )    |   d  θ           I  r       1    2  π      superscript   subscript   0     2  π          f    r   superscript  e    i  θ       d  θ       I(r)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\!\left|f(re^{i\theta})\right|\,d\theta     for     0  <  r  <  R   ,        0  r       R     0   then this function is strictly increasing and logarithmically convex .
