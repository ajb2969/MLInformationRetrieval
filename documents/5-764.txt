Hardy's theorem

In mathematics, Hardy's theorem is a result in complex analysis describing the behavior of holomorphic functions.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a holomorphic function on the open ball centered at zero and radius 
 
 
 
  in the complex plane, and assume that 
 
 
 
  is not a constant function. If one defines



for 
 
 
 
  then this function is strictly increasing and logarithmically convex.
