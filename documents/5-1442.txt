   Bonne projection      Bonne projection   A Bonne projection is a pseudoconical equal-area map projection , sometimes called a dépôt de la guerre or a Sylvanus projection. Although named after Rigobert Bonne (1727–1795), the projection was in use prior to his birth, in 1511 by Sylvano, Honter in 1561, De l'Isle before 1700 and Coronelli in 1696. Both Sylvano and Honter’s usages were approximate, however, and it is not clear they intended to be the same projection. 1  The projection is:      x  =   ρ   sin   E         x    ρ    E      x=\rho\sin E\,         y  =    cot   φ  1    -   ρ   cos   E          y       subscript  φ  1      ρ    E       y=\cot\varphi_{1}-\rho\cos E\,     where      ρ  =     cot   φ  1    +   φ  1    -   φ        ρ         subscript  φ  1     subscript  φ  1    φ     \rho=\cot\varphi_{1}+\varphi_{1}-\varphi\,         E  =     (   λ  -   λ  0    )    cos  φ    ρ       E        λ   subscript  λ  0      φ    ρ     E=\frac{(\lambda-\lambda_{0})\cos\varphi}{\rho}     and φ is the latitude, λ is the longitude, λ 0 is the longitude of the central meridian, and φ 1 is the standard parallel of the projection. 2  Parallels of latitude are concentric circular arcs, and the scale is true along these arcs. On the central meridian and the standard latitude shapes are not distorted.  The inverse projection is given by:      φ  =     cot   φ  1    +   φ  1    -   ρ        φ         subscript  φ  1     subscript  φ  1    ρ     \varphi=\cot\varphi_{1}+\varphi_{1}-\rho\,         λ  =    λ  0   +    ρ   {   arctan   [   x  /   (    cot   φ  1    -  y   )    ]    }    /   cos  φ         λ     subscript  λ  0       ρ       x       subscript  φ  1    y         φ       \lambda=\lambda_{0}+\rho\{\arctan[x/(\cot\varphi_{1}-y)]\}/\cos\varphi     where      ρ  =       ρ  absent    \rho=   ±     [    x  2   +    (    cot   φ  1    -  y   )   2    ]    1  /  2      superscript   delimited-[]     superscript  x  2    superscript       subscript  φ  1    y   2       1  2     [x^{2}+(\cot\varphi_{1}-y)^{2}]^{1/2}     taking the sign of    φ  1     subscript  φ  1    \varphi_{1}   .  Special cases of the Bonne projection include the sinusoidal projection , when φ 1 is zero, and the Werner projection , when φ 1 is π/2. The Bonne projection can be seen as an intermediate projection in the unwinding of a Werner projection into a Sinusoidal projection ; an alternative intermediate would be a Bottomley projection 3  See also   List of map projections   References  External links   Cybergeo article  Bonne Map Projection (manifold.net)  Table of examples and properties of all common projections , from radicalcartography.net  An interactive Java Applet to study the metric deformations of the Bonne Projection  Bonne Projection (wolfram.com)   "  Category:Cartographic projections  Category:Equal-area projections     Flattening the Earth: Two Thousand Years of Map Projections , John P.
