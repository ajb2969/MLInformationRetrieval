   Rule complex      Rule complex   A rule complex is a set consisting of rules and/or other rule complexes. This is a generalization of a set of rules, and provides a tool to investigate and describe how rules can function as values, norms , judgmental or prescriptive rules, and meta-rules. Also possible is to examine objects consisting of rules such as roles, routines , algorithms , models of reality, social relationships, and institutions. In game theory , rules and rule complexes can be used to define the behavior and interactions of the players (although in generalized game theory , the rules are not necessarily static. Rule complexes are especially associated with sociologist  Tom R. Burns and Anna Gomolinska and the Uppsala Theory Circle .  Formalization  Rules  In this setting, a rule is type of knowledge (in the sense of epistemic logic (see Fagin, 2003)) formalized as a set of premises or conditions, a set of justifications, and a set of conclusions (this may be written as a triple, a rule    r  :=   (  X  ,  Y  ,  α  )      assign  r   X  Y  α     r:=(X,Y,\alpha)   ). Elements of X should hold, and of Y may hold. If Y , the justifications, do not hold, then the rule cannot be applied. If X , the premises, obtain and the justifications are not known to not apply, then the rule is applied, and   α   α   \alpha   is concluded. If X and Y are empty, then the rule is axiomatic (a "fact" or unconditional directive). Thus, rules can be seen as the basic objects of knowledge.  Rule complex  Formally, a rule complex is the class which contains all finite sets of rules, is closed under set-theoretical union and power set , and preserves inclusion:   Any finite set of rules is a rule complex;  If     C  1   ,   C  2       subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2     C_{1},C_{2}   are rule complexes, then     C  1   ∪   C  2        subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2     C_{1}\cup C_{2}   and    P   (   C  1   )       P   subscript  C  1     P(C_{1})   are rule complexes;  If     C  1   ⊆   C  2        subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2     C_{1}\subseteq C_{2}   and    C  2     subscript  C  2    C_{2}   is a rule complex, then    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   is a rule complex.   This means that for rule complexes    C  1     subscript  C  1    C_{1}   and    C  2     subscript  C  2    C_{2}   ,      C  1   ∩   C  2    ,    C  1   -   C  2          subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2       subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2      C_{1}\cap C_{2},C_{1}-C_{2}   are also rule complexes. A complex   B   B   B   is a subcomplex of the complex   A   A   A   if    B  =  A      B  A    B=A   or   B   B   B   may be obtained from   A   A   A   by deleting some rules from   A   A   A   and/or redundant parentheses (Burns, 2005).
