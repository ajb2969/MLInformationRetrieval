   Dual cone and polar cone      Dual cone and polar cone     Dual cone and polar cone are closely related concepts in convex analysis , a branch of mathematics .  Dual cone  The dual cone  C* of a subset  C in a linear space  X , e.g. Euclidean space  R n , with topological  dual space  X* is the set        C  *   =   {   y  ∈   X  *    :     ⟨  y  ,  x  ⟩   ≥  0     ∀  x   ∈  C    }    ,       superscript  C     conditional-set    y   superscript  X      formulae-sequence     y  x   0      for-all  x   C       C^{*}=\left\{y\in X^{*}:\langle y,x\rangle\geq 0\quad\forall x\in C\right\},     where  is the duality pairing between X and X* , i.e.  = y ( x ).  C* is always a convex cone , even if C is neither convex nor a cone .  Alternatively, many authors define the dual cone in the context of a real Hilbert space , (such as R n equipped with the Euclidean inner product) to be what is sometimes called the internal dual cone .        C  internal  *   :=   {   y  ∈  X   :     ⟨  y  ,  x  ⟩   ≥  0     ∀  x   ∈  C    }    .     assign   subscript   superscript  C    internal    conditional-set    y  X    formulae-sequence     y  x   0      for-all  x   C       C^{*}_{\text{internal}}:=\left\{y\in X:\langle y,x\rangle\geq 0\quad\forall x%
 \in C\right\}.     Using this latter definition for C* , we have that when C is a cone, the following properties hold: 1   A non-zero vector y is in C* if and only if both of the following conditions hold:    y is a normal at the origin of a hyperplane that supports  C .  y and C lie on the same side of that supporting hyperplane.    C* is closed and convex.  C 1 ⊆ C 2 implies     C  2  *   ⊆   C  1  *        superscript   subscript  C  2      superscript   subscript  C  1       C_{2}^{*}\subseteq C_{1}^{*}   .  If C has nonempty interior, then C* is pointed , i.e. C* contains no line in its entirety.  If C is a cone and the closure of C is pointed, then C* has nonempty interior.  C** is the closure of the smallest convex cone containing C (a consequence of the hyperplane separation theorem )   Self-dual cones  A cone C in a vector space X is said to be self-dual if X can be equipped with an inner product ⟨⋅,⋅⟩ such that the internal dual cone relative to this inner product is equal to C . 2 Those authors who define the dual cone as the internal dual cone in a real Hilbert space usually say that a cone is self-dual if it is equal to its internal dual. This is slightly different than the above definition, which permits a change of inner product. For instance, the above definition makes a cone in R n with ellipsoidal base self-dual, because the inner product can be changed to make the base spherical, and a with spherical base in R n is equal to its internal dual.  The nonnegative orthant of R n and the space of all positive semidefinite matrices are self-dual, as are the cones with ellipsoidal base (often called "spherical cones", "Lorentz cones", or sometimes "ice-cream cones"). So are all cones in R 3 whose base is the convex hull of a regular polygon with an odd number of vertices. A less regular example is the cone in R 3 whose base is the "house": the convex hull of a square and a point outside the square forming an equilateral triangle (of the appropriate height) with one of the sides of the square.  Polar cone  For a set C in X , the polar cone of C is the set 3        C  o   =   {   y  ∈   X  *    :     ⟨  y  ,  x  ⟩   ≤  0     ∀  x   ∈  C    }    .       superscript  C  o    conditional-set    y   superscript  X      formulae-sequence     y  x   0      for-all  x   C       C^{o}=\left\{y\in X^{*}:\langle y,x\rangle\leq 0\quad\forall x\in C\right\}.     It can be seen that the polar cone is equal to the negative of the dual cone, i.e. C o = − C* .  For a closed convex cone C in X , the polar cone is equivalent to the polar set for C . 4  See also   Bipolar theorem  Polar set   References           "  Category:Mathematical optimization  Category:Convex geometry  Category:Linear programming  Category:Convex analysis     ↩  Iochum, Bruno, "Cônes autopolaires et algèbres de Jordan", Springer, 1984. ↩  ↩  ↩
