The Lorentz group, a Lie group on which special relativity is based, has a wide variety of representations. Many of these representations, both finite-dimensional and infinite-dimensional, are important in theoretical physics in the description of particles in relativistic quantum mechanics, as well as of both particles and quantum fields in quantum field theory.
This representation theory also provides the theoretical ground for the concept of spin, which, for a particle, can be either integer or half-integer in the unit of the reduced Planck constant ℏ. Spin 0 particles are described by objects that transform according to the (0,0) representation, particles with spin $\frac{1}{2}$ by objects that transform according to the ($\frac{1}{2}$, 0), the (0, $\frac{1}{2}$) or the ($\frac{1}{2}$, 0) ⊕ (0, $\frac{1}{2}$) representation and spin 1 particles by objects that transform according to the ($\frac{1}{2}$,$\frac{1}{2}$) representation of the Lorentz group.1
Quantum mechanical wave functions representing particles with half-integer spin are called spinors. The classical electromagnetic field has spin as well. It transforms under a representation with spin one.2 It enters into general relativity in that in small enough regions of spacetime, physics is that of special relativity.
The group may also be represented in terms of a set of functions defined on the Riemann sphere. These are the Riemann P-functions, which are expressible as hypergeometric functions. The identity component  of the Lorentz group is isomorphic to the Möbius group, and hence any representation of the Lorentz group is necessarily a representation of the Möbius group and vice versa.The subgroup $SO(3)$ with its representation theory form a simpler theory, but the two are related and both are prominent in theoretical physics as descriptions of spin, angular momentum, and other phenomena related to rotation.
The adopted Lie algebra basis and conventions used are presented here.
Finite-dimensional representations
Representation theory of groups in general, and Lie groups in particular, is a very rich subject. The full Lorentz group makes no exception. The Lorentz group has some properties that makes it "agreeable" and others that make it "not very agreeable" within the context of representation theory. The group is semisimple, and also simple, but is not connected, and none of its components are simply connected. Perhaps most importantly, the Lorentz group is not compact.3
For finite-dimensional representations, the presence of semisimplicity means that the Lorentz group can be dealt with the same way as other semisimple groups using a well-developed theory. In addition, all representations are built from the irreducible ones.4 But, the non-compactness of the Lorentz group, in combination with lack of simple connectedness, cannot be dealt with in all the aspects as in the simple framework that applies to simply connected, compact groups. Non-compactness implies that no nontrivial finite-dimensional unitary representations exist.5 Lack of simple connectedness gives rise to spin representations of the group.6 The non-connectedness means that, for representations of the full Lorentz group, one has to deal with time reversal and space inversion separately.78
History
The development of the finite-dimensional representation theory of the Lorentz group mostly follows that of the subject in general. Lie theory originated with Sophus Lie in 1873.9 By 1888 the classification of simple Lie algebras was essentially completed by Wilhelm Killing.10 In 1913 the theorem of highest weight for representations of simple Lie algebras, the path that will be followed here, was completed by Élie Cartan.11 Richard Brauer was 1935–38 largely responsible for the development of the Weyl-Brauer matrices describing how spin representations of the Lorentz Lie algebra can be embedded in Clifford algebras.12 The Lorentz group has also historically received special attention in representation theory, see History of infinite-dimensional unitary representations below, due to its exceptional importance in physics. Hermann Weyl,1314 Harish-Chandra15 mathematicians who also made major contributions to the general theory, and the physicists Eugene Wigner16 and Valentine Bargmann1718 made substantial contributions specialized to the Lorentz group over the years.19 Physicist Paul Dirac was perhaps the first to manifestly knit everything together in a practical application of major lasting importance with the Dirac equation in 1928.20
The Lie algebra
 According to the general representation theory of Lie groups, one first looks for the representations of the complexification, so(3;1)C of the Lie algebra so(3;1) of the Lorentz group. A convenient basis for so(3;1) is given by the three generators  of rotations and the three generators  of boosts as described in Conventions below. Now complexify the Lie algebra, and then change basis to the components of:
$$\mathbf{A} = \frac{\mathbf{J} + i \mathbf{K}}{2}\,,\quad \mathbf{B} = \frac{\mathbf{J} - i \mathbf{K}}{2}\,.$$21
In this new basis, one checks that the components of  (A1, A2, A3)}} and  (B1, B2, B3)}} separately satisfy the commutation relations of the Lie algebra su(2) and moreover that they commute with each other22
$$\left[A_i ,A_j\right] = i\varepsilon_{ijk}A_k\,,\quad \left[B_i ,B_j\right] = i\varepsilon_{ijk}B_k\,,\quad \left[A_i ,B_j\right] = 0\,,$$23
where $i , j , k$ are indices which each take values $1, 2, 3$, and  is the three-dimensional Levi-Civita symbol. Let  and  denote the complex linear span of $\mathbf{ A } $ and $\mathbf{ B } $ respectively. One has the isomorphisms
where sl(2, C) is the complexification of su(2) ≈ $\mathbf{ A } $ ≈ $\mathbf{ B } $. The utility of these isomorphisms comes from the fact that all irreducible representations of su(2) are known. Every irreducible representation of su(2) is isomorphic to one of the highest weight representations. Moreover, there is a one-to-one correspondence between linear representations of su(2) and complex linear representations of sl(2, C).24
The unitarian trick
 In , all isomorphisms are $\mathbf{ C } $-linear (the last is just a defining equality). The most important part of the manipulations below is that the $\mathbf{ R } $-linear (irreducible) representations of a (real or complex) Lie algebra are in one-to-one correspondence with $\mathbf{ C } $-linear (irreducible) representation of its complexification.25 With this in mind, it is seen that the $\mathbf{ R } $-linear representations of the real forms of the far left, $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$, and the far right, $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, in  can be obtained from the $\mathbf{ C } $-linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) ⊕ \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$.
The manipulations to obtain representations of a non-compact algebra (here so(3;1)), and subsequently the non-compact group itself, from qualitative knowledge about unitary representations of a compact group (here $SU(2)$) is a variant of Weyl's so-called unitarian trick. The trick specialized to $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ can be summarized concisely.26 Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional complex vector space. The following are equivalent:

There is a representation of $SL(2, \mathbf{ R } )$ on $V$
There is a representation of $SU(2)$ on $V$
There is a holomorphic representation of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ on $V$
There is a representation of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ R } )$ on $V$
There is a representation of $\mathbf{ su } (2)$ on $V$
There is a complex linear representation of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ on $V$

If one representation is irreducible, then all of them are. In this list, cross products (groups) or direct sums (Lie algebras) may be introduced (consistently). The essence of the trick is that the starting point in the above list is immaterial. Both qualitative knowledge (like existence theorems for one item on the list) and concrete realizations for one item on the list will translate and propagate, respectively, to the others.
Now, the representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) ⊕ \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, which is the Lie algebra of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } ) × SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, are supposed to be irreducible. This means that they must be tensor products of complex linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, as can be seen by restriction to the subgroup $SU(2) × SU(2) ⊂ SL(2, \mathbf{ C } ) × SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, a compact group to which the Peter–Weyl theorem applies.27 The irreducible unitary representations of $SU(2) × SU(2)$ are precisely the tensor products of irreducible unitary representations of $SU(2)$. These stand in one-to-one correspondence with the holomorphic representations of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } ) × SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$28 and these, in turn, are in one-to-one correspondence with the complex linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) ⊕ \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ because $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } ) × SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ is simply connected.29
For $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, there exists the highest weight representations (obtainable, via the trick, from the corresponding $\mathbf{ su } (2)$-representations), here indexed by $μ$ for $μ = 0, 1, …$. The tensor products of two complex linear factors then form the irreducible complex linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) ⊕ \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$. For reference, if  and  are representations of a Lie algebra $\mathbf{ g } $, then their tensor product  is given by either of
where $Id$ is the identity operator. Here, the latter interpretation is intended. The not necessarily complex linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ come using another variant of the unitarian trick as is shown in the last Lie algebra isomorphism in .
The representations
The representations for all Lie algebras and groups involved in the unitarian trick can now be obtained. The real linear representations for $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ and $\mathbf{ so } (3; 1)$ follow here assuming the complex linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are known. Explicit realizations and group representations are given later.
sl(2, C)
The complex linear representations of the complexification of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, , obtained via isomorphisms in , stand in one-to-one correspondence with the real linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$.30 The set of all, at least real linear, irreducible representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are thus indexed by a pair $(μ, ν)$. The complex linear ones, corresponding precisely to the complexification of the real linear $\mathbf{ su } (2)$ representations, are of the form $(μ, 0)$, while the conjugate linear ones are the $(0, ν)$.31 All others are real linear only. The linearity properties follow from the canonical injection, the far right in , of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ into its complexification. Representations on the form $(ν, ν)$ or $(μ, ν) ⊕ (ν, μ)$ are given by real matrices (the latter is not irreducible). Explicitly, the real linear $(μ, ν)$-representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are
$$\phi_{\mu, \nu}(X) = \phi_\mu \otimes \overline{\phi}_\nu(X) = \phi_\mu(X) \otimes \mathrm{Id}_{\nu + 1} + \mathrm{Id}_{\mu + 1} \otimes \overline{\phi_\nu(X)}, \quad X \in \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C})$$ where  0,1, …}} are the complex linear irreducible representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ and  0,1, …}} their complex conjugate representations. Now the tensor product is interpreted in the former sense of .
so(3; 1)
Via the displayed isomorphisms in (A1) and knowledge of the complex linear irreducible representations of $sl(2, \mathbf{ C } ) ⊕ sl(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, upon solving for $\mathbf{ J } $ and $\mathbf{ K } $, all irreducible representations of $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$C, and, by restriction, those of $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ are known. It's worth noting that the representations of $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ obtained this way are real linear (and not complex or conjugate linear) because the algebra is not closed upon conjugation, but they are still irreducible.32 Since $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ is semisimple,33 all its representations, not necessarily irreducible, can be built up as direct sums of the irreducible ones.
Thus the finite dimensional irreducible representations of the Lorentz algebra are classified by an ordered pair of half-integers $ m = μ/2$ and $ n = ν/2$, conventionally written as one of
$$(m,n) \equiv D^{(m,n)} \equiv \pi_{m,n}.$$
The notation  is usually reserved for the group representations. Let , where $V$ is a vector space, denote the irreducible representations of $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ according to this classification. These are, up to a similarity transformation, uniquely given by
where the  (J(n)1, J(n)2, J(n)3)}} are the $(2 n + 1)$-dimensional irreducible spin $n$ representations of $\mathbf{ so } (3)$ ≈ $\mathbf{ su } (2)$ and  is the $n$-dimensional unit matrix. Explicit formulas on component form are given at the end of the article.

Since for any irrep where $m ≠ n$ it is essential to operate over the field of complex numbers, the direct sum of representations $( m , n )$ and $( n , m )$ has a particular relevance to physics, since it permits to use linear operators over real numbers.

(0, 0) is the Lorentz scalar representation. This representation is carried by relativistic scalar field theories.

The group
The approach in this section is based on a theorem that, in turn, is based on the fundamental Lie correspondence.37 The Lie correspondence is, in essence, a dictionary between connected Lie groups and Lie algebras.38
The Lie correspondence
 The Lie correspondence and some results based on it needed here and below are stated for reference. If G denotes a linear Lie group (i.e. a group representable as a group of matrices) and $\mathbf{ g } $ a linear Lie algebra (again, linear means representable as an algebra of matrices),39 let $Γ( \mathbf{ g } )$ denote the group generated by $exp( \mathbf{ g } )$, and let $L ( G )$ denote the Lie algebra of $G$ (interpreted as the set of matrices $X$ such that  for all $t ∈ \mathbf{ R } $). The Lie correspondence reads in modern language, here specialized to linear Lie groups, as follows:

There is a one-to-one correspondence between connected linear Lie groups and linear Lie algebras given by $G ↔ \mathbf{ g } $ with $\mathbf{ g } = L ( G )$ or, equivalently $G = Γ( \mathbf{ g } )$, expressed as $Γ( L ( G )) = G$, respectively $L (Γ( \mathbf{ g } )) = \mathbf{ g } $.40 (Lie)

The following are some corollaries that will be used in the sequel:
:*A connected linear Lie group $G$ is abelian if and only if $\mathbf{ g } $ is abelian.41 (Lie i)
:*A connected subgroup $H$ with Lie algebra $\mathbf{ h } $ of a connected linear Lie group $G$ is normal if and only if $\mathbf{ h } ⊂ \mathbf{ g } $ is an ideal.42 (Lie ii)
:*If $G , H$ are linear Lie groups with Lie algebras $\mathbf{ g } , \mathbf{ h } $ and $Π: G → H$ is a group homomorphism, then $π: \mathbf{ g } → \mathbf{ h } $, its pushforward at the identity, is a Lie algebra homomorphism and  eiπ(X)}} for every $X ∈ \mathbf{ g } $.43 (Lie iii)
Lie algebra representations from group representations
Using the above theorem it is always possible to pass from a representation of a Lie group $G$ to a representation of its Lie algebra $\mathbf{ g } $. If $Π : G → GL( V )$ is a group representation for some vector space $V$, then its pushforward (differential) at the identity, or Lie map, $π : \mathbf{ g } → End V$ is a Lie algebra representation. It is explicitly computed using
This, of course, holds for the Lorentz group in particular, but not all Lie algebra representations arise this way because their corresponding group representations may not exist as proper representations, i.e. they are projective, see below.
Group representations from Lie algebra representations
 Given a $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ representation, one may try to construct a representation of , the identity component of the Lorentz group, by using the exponential mapping. If $X$ is an element of so(3;1) in the standard representation, then
is a Lorentz transformation by general properties of Lie algebras. Motivated by this and the Lie correspondence theorem stated above, let $π : \mathbf{ so } (3;1) → \mathbf{ gl } ( V )$ for some vector space $V$ be a representation and tentatively define a representation $Π$ of  by first setting
The subscript $U$ indicates a small open set containing the identity. Its precise meaning is defined below. There are at least two potential problems with this definition. The first is that it is not obvious that this yields a group homomorphism, or even a well defined map at all (local existence). The second problem is that for a given  there may not be exactly one $X ∈ \mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ such that  (local uniqueness). The soundness of the tentative definition  is given in several steps below:

 is a local homomorphism.
$Π( g )$ defined along a path using properties of  is a global homomorphism.
The exponential mapping  is surjective.
$Π( g )$ defined along a path coincides with  with  SO(3, 1)+}}.

Local existence and uniqueness
A theorem44 based on the inverse function theorem states that the map  is one-to-one for $X$ small enough (A). This makes the map well-defined. The qualitative form of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula then guarantees that it is a group homomorphism, still for $X$ small enough (B).45 Let  denote image under the exponential mapping of the open set in $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ where conditions  and  both hold. Let  eX, h {{=}} eY}}, then
This shows that the map  is a well-defined group homomorphism on $U$.
Global existence and uniqueness
Technically, formula  is used to define $Π$ near the identity. For other elements $g ∉ U$ one chooses a path from the identity to $g$ and defines $Π$ along that path by partitioning it finely enough so that formula  can be used again on the resulting factors in the partition. In detail, one sets
where the  are on the path and the factors on the far right are uniquely defined by  provided that all  and, for all conceivable pairs $h , k$ of points on the path between  and ,  as well. For each $i$ take, by the inverse function theorem, the unique  such that  =  and obtain )\cdots\Pi_U(e^{iX_2})\Pi_U(e^{iX_1}) = e^{i\pi(X_n)}e^{i\pi(X_{n - 1})}\cdots e^{i\pi(X_2)}e^{i\pi(X_1)}.|G4}}
By compactness of the path there is an $n$ large enough so that $Π( g )$ is well defined, possibly depending on the partition and/or the path, whether $g$ is close to the identity or not.
Partition independence
It turns out that the result is always independent of the partitioning of the path.46 To demonstrate the independence of the partitioning of the chosen path, one employs the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula. It shows that  is a group homomorphism for elements in $U$. To see this, first fix a partitioning used in . Then insert a new point $h$ somewhere on the path, say
$$g = \cdots(g_{i + 1}h^{-1})(hg_i^{-1})\cdots, \qquad \cdots \Pi_U(g_{i + 1}h^{-1})\Pi_U(hg_i^{-1})\cdots.$$ But
$$\cdots \Pi_U(g_{i + 1}h^{-1})\Pi_U(hg_i^{-1})\cdots = \cdots\Pi_U(g_{i + 1}h^{-1}hg_i^{-1})\cdots = \cdots\Pi_U(g_{i + 1}g_i^{-1})\cdots$$ as a consequence of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula and the conditions on the original partitioning. Thus adding a point on the path has no effect on the definition of $Π( g )$. Then for any two given partitionings of a given path, they have common refinement, their union. This refinement can be reached from any of the two partitionings by, one-by-one, adding points from the other partition. No individual addition changes the definition of $Π( g )$, hence, since there are finitely many points in each partition, the value of $Π( g )$ must have been the same for the two partitionings to begin with.
Path independence
For simply connected groups, the construction will be independent of the path as well, yielding a well defined representation.47 In that case formula  can unambiguously be used directly. Simply connected spaces have the property that any two paths can be continuously deformed into each other. Any such deformation is called a homotopy and is usually chosen as a continuous function $H$ from the unit square  into the group. For $s = 0$ the image is one of the paths, for $s = 1$ the other, for intermediate $s$, an intermediate path results, but endpoints are kept fixed.
One deforms the path, a little bit at a time, using the previous result, the independence of partitioning. Each consecutive deformation is so small that two consecutive deformed paths can be partitioned using the same partition points. Thus two consecutive deformed paths yield the same value for $Π( g )$. But any two pairs of consecutive deformations need not have the same choice partition points, so the actual path laid out in the group as one progresses through the deformation does indeed change.
Using compactness arguments, in a finite number of steps, the original ($s = 0$) path is deformed into the other ($s = 1$) without affecting the value of $Π( g )$.48
Global homomorphism
The map  is, by the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff formula, a local homomorphism. To show that $Π$ is a global homomorphism, consider two elements . Lay out paths  from the identity to them and define a path  going along  for $0 ≤ t ≤ \frac{1}{2}$ and along  for $\frac{1}{2} ≤ t ≤ 1$. This is a path from the identity to $gh$. Select adequate partitionings for . This corresponds to a choice of "times"  and . Divide the first set with 2 and divide the second set with 2 and add $\frac{1}{2}$ and so obtain a new (adequate) set of "times" to be used for . Direct computation shows that, with these partitionings (and hence all partitionings), $Π( gh ) = Π( g )Π( h )$.49
Surjectiveness of exponential mapping
From a practical point of view, it is important that formula  can be used for all elements of the group. The Lie correspondence theorem above guarantees that  holds for all $X ∈ \mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$, but provides no guarantee that all  are in the image of . For general Lie groups, this is not the case, especially not for non-compact groups, as for example for $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, the universal covering group of . It will be treated in this respect below.
But  is surjective. One way to see this is to make use of the isomorphism , the latter being the Möbius group. It is a quotient of $GL( n , \mathbf{ C } )$ (see the linked article). Let $p:GL( n , \mathbf{ C } ) → PGL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ denote the quotient map. Now $exp: \mathbf{ gl } ( n , \mathbf{ C } ) → GL( n , \mathbf{ C } )$ is onto.50 Now apply the Lie correspondence theorem with $π$ being the differential at the identity of $p$. Then for all $X ∈ \mathbf{ gl } ( n , \mathbf{ C } )$  eiπ(X)}}. Since the left hand side is surjective (both $exp$ and $p$ are), the right hand side is surjective and hence $exp: \mathbf{ pgl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) → PGL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ is surjective. Finally, recycle the argument once more, but now with the known isomorphism between  and $PGL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ to find that $exp$ is onto for the connected component of the Lorentz group.
Consistency
From the way $Π( g )$ has been defined for elements far from the identity, it not immediately clear that formula  holds for all elements of , i.e. that one can take $U = G$ in . But, in summary,

$Π$ is a uniquely constructed homomorphism.
Using  with $Π$ as defined here, then one ends up with the $π$ one started with since $Π$ was defined that way near the identity, and  depends only on an arbitrarily small neighborhood of the identity.
 is surjective.

Hence  holds everywhere.51 One finally unconditionally writes 
Projective representations
For a group that is connected but not simply connected, such as , the result may depend on the homotopy class of the chosen path.52 The result, when using , will then depend on which $X$ in the Lie algebra is used to obtain the representative matrix for $g$.
The Lorentz group is doubly connected so that its fundamental group , whose elements are the path homotopy classes, has two members. Thus not all representations of the Lie algebra will yield representations of the group, but some will instead yield projective representations.53 Once these conclusions has been reached, and once one knows whether a representation is projective, there is no need not be concerned about paths and partitions. Formula  applies to all group elements and all representations, including the projective ones.
For a projective representation $Π$ of  it holds that  since any loop in  traversed twice, due to the double connectedness, is contractible to a point so that its homotopy class is that of a constant map. It follows that $Π$ is a double-valued function. One cannot consistently chose sign to obtain a continuous representation of all of , but this is possible to do locally around any point.54
The covering group
Consider $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ as a real Lie algebra with basis , where the sigmas are the Pauli matrices. From the relations  one obtains  which are exactly on the form of the 3-dimensional version of the commutation relations for $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$ (see Conventions and Lie algebra bases below). Thus map ,, and extend by linearity to obtain an isomorphism. Since $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ is simply connected, it is the universal covering group of .
A geometric view

E.P. Wigner investigated the Lorentz group in depth and is known for the Bargmann-Wigner equations. The realization of the covering group given here is from his 1937 paper.

Let  denote the set of path homotopy classes  of paths , from  to  and define the set
and endow it with the multiplication operation
,\quad p_{12}(t) = p_1(t)\cdot p_2(t).|C2}}
The dot on the far right denotes path multiplication. With this multiplication, $G$ is a group and $G ≈ SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$,55 the universal covering group of . By the above construction, there is, since each  has two elements, a 2:1 covering map  and an isomorphism $G ≈ SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$. According to covering group theory, the Lie algebras $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$, $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ and $\mathbf{ g } $ of $G$ are all isomorphic. The covering map  is simply given by  g}}.
An algebraic view
For an algebraic view of the universal covering group, let $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ act on the set of all Hermitean  matrices $\mathbf{ h } $ by the operation56 
Since $X ∈ \mathbf{ h } $ is Hermitean,  is again Hemitean because , and also , so the action is linear as well. An element of $\mathbf{ h } $ may generally be written in the form  for  real, showing that $\mathbf{ h } $ is a 4-dimensional real vector space. Moreover,  meaning that $\mathbf{ P } $ is a group homomorphism into $GL( \mathbf{ h } ) ⊂ End \mathbf{ h } $. Thus $\mathbf{ P } : SL(2, \mathbf{ C } ) → GL ( \mathbf{ h } )$ is a 4-dimensional representation of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$. Its kernel must in particular take the identity matrix to itself,  A†A {{=}} I ⇒ A† {{=}} A−1}}. Thus $AX = XA$ for $A$ in the kernel so, by Schur's lemma,57 $A$ is a multiple of the identity, which must be $± I$ since $det A = 1$.58 Now map $\mathbf{ h } $ to spacetime  endowed with the Lorentz metric, Minkowski space, via  The action of $\mathbf{ P } ( A )$ on $\mathbf{ h } $ preserves determinants since . The induced representation $\mathbf{ p } $ of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ on , via the above isomorphism, given by  will preserve the Lorentz inner product since . This means that $\mathbf{ p } (A)$ belongs to the full Lorentz group $O(3;1)$. By the main theorem of connectedness, since $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ is connected, its image under $\mathbf{ p } $ in $O(3;1)$ is connected as well, and hence is contained in . It can be shown that the Lie map of , $π : \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) → \mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ is a Lie algebra isomorphism (its kernel is 59 and must therefore be an isomorphism for dimensional reasons). The map $\mathbf{ P } $ is also onto.60 Thus $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, since it is simply connected, is the universal covering group of , isomorphic to the group $G$ of above.
Representations of $SL(2, C)$ and $sl(2, C)$
The complex linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ and $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are more straightforward to obtain than the  representations. If  is a representation of $\mathbf{ su } (2)$ with highest weight $μ$, then the complexification of  is a complex linear representation of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$. All complex linear representation of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are of this form. The holomorphic group representations (meaning the corresponding Lie algebra representation is complex linear) are obtained by exponentiation. By simple connectedness of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, this always yields a representation of the group as opposed to in the  case. The real linear representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are exactly the $(μ, ν)$-representations presented earlier. They can be exponentiated too. The $(μ, 0)$-representations are complex linear and are (isomorphic to) the highest weight-representations. These are usually indexed with only one integer.
It is also possible to obtain representations of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ directly. This will be done below. Then, using the unitarian trick, going the other way, one finds $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$-,$SU(2)$-,$\mathbf{ su } (2)$-,$SL(2, \mathbf{ R } )$-, and $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ R } )$-representations as well as $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$-representations (via ) and, possibly projective, -representations (via projection from $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, see below, or exponentiation).
The mathematics convention is used in this section for convenience. Lie algebra elements differ by a factor of $i$ and there is no factor of $i$ in the exponential mapping compared to the physics convention used elsewhere. Let the basis of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ be  This choice of basis, and the notation, is standard in the mathematical literature.
Concrete realization
The irreducible holomorphic $( n + 1)$-dimensional representations of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, $n ≥ 0$, can be realized on a set of functions  where each  is a homogeneous polynomial of degree $n$ in 2 variables.6162 The elements of  appears as  cnz1n + cn−1z1n−1z2 + ... + cnz2n}}. The action of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ is given by
The associated $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$-action is, using  and the definition above, given by
Defining  e−tXz {{=}} (z1(t), z2(t))T}} and using the chain rule one finds  The basis elements of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are then represented by  on the space  (all $n$). By employing the unitarian trick one obtains representations for $SU(2)$, $\mathbf{ su } (2)$, $SL(2, \mathbf{ R } $, and $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ R } )$, all are obtained by restriction of either  or . They are formally identical to  or . With a choice of basis for , all these representations become matrix groups or matrix Lie algebras.
The $(μ, ν)$-representations are realized on a space of polynomials  in , homogeneous of degree $μ$ in  and homogeneous of degree $ν$ in .63 The representations are given by  By carrying out the same steps as above, one finds (\overline{X_{11}}\overline{z_1} + \overline{X_{12}}\overline{z_2}) -\frac{\partial P}{\partial \overline{z_2}}(\overline{X_{21}}\overline{z_1} + \overline{X_{22}}\overline{z_2}), \quad X \in \mathfrak{sl}(2, \mathbb{C}),|S7}} from which the expressions  + \overline{z_2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z_2}}, \quad \phi_{\mu,\nu}(X) = -z_2\frac{\partial}{\partial z_1} - \overline{z_2}\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z_1}}, \quad \phi_{\mu,\nu}(Y) = -z_1\frac{\partial}{\partial z_2} - \overline{z_1}\frac{\partial}{\partial \overline{z_2}} |S8}} for the basis elements follow.
Non-surjectiveness of exponential mapping
[[Image:Commutative diagram SO(3, 1) latex.svg|300px|thumb|left|This diagram shows the web of maps discussed in the text. Here  is a finite-dimensional vector space carrying representations of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$, $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, , $exp$ is the exponential mapping, $\mathbf{ p } $ is the covering map from $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ onto  and $σ$ is the Lie algebra isomorphism induced by it.
The maps $Π, π$ and the two $Φ$ are representations. the picture is only partially true when $Π$ is projective.]]
Unlike in the case , the exponential mapping $exp: \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) → SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ is not onto.64 The conjugacy classes of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are represented by the matrices  but there is no element $Q$ in $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ such that $q = exp( Q )$.65
In general, if $g$ is an element of a connected Lie group $G$ with Lie algebra $\mathbf{ g } $, then  This follows from the compactness of a path from the identity to $g$ and the one-to-one nature of $exp$ near the identity. In the case of the matrix $q$, one may write 
The kernel of the covering map  of above is , a normal subgroup of . The composition $\mathbf{ p } ∘ exp: \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) → SO(3, 1)$ is onto. If a matrix $a$ is not in the image of $exp$, then there is a matrix $b$ equivalent to it with respect to $\mathbf{ p } $, meaning $\mathbf{ p } ( b ) = \mathbf{ p } ( a )$, that is in the image of $exp$. The condition for equivalence is .66 In the case of the matrix $q$, one may solve for $p$ in the equation  -I ∈ N}}. One finds
As a corollary, since the covering map $\mathbf{ p } $ is a homomorphism,the mapping version of the Lie correspondence  can be used to provide a proof of the surjectiveness of $exp$ for $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$. Let $σ$ denote the isomorphism between $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ and $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$. Refer to the commutative diagram. One has $\mathbf{ p } ∘ exp: \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) → SO(3, 1) = exp ∘ σ$ for all $X ∈ \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$. Since $\mathbf{ p } ∘ exp$ is onto, $exp ∘ σ$ is onto, and hence  is onto as well.
-representations from $SL(2, C)$-representations
By the first isomorphism theorem, a representation $(Φ, V )$ of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ descends to a representation $(Π, V )$ of  if and only if $ker \mathbf{ p } ⊂ ker Φ$. Refer to the commutative diagram. If this condition holds, then both elements in the fiber  will be mapped by $Φ$ to the same representative, and the expression  makes sense. One may thus define  Φ(p−1(g))}}. In particular, if $Π$ is faithful, i.e. having kernel = $I$, then there is no corresponding proper representation of , but there is a projective one as was shown in a previous section, corresponding to the two possible choices of representative in each fiber .
Lie algebra representations of $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$ are obtained from $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$-representations simply by composition with .
$SL(2, C)$-representations from -representations
$SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$-representations can be obtained from non-projective -representations by composition with the projection map $\mathbf{ p } $. These are always representations since they are compositions of group homomorphisms. Such a representation is never faithful because . If the -representation is projective, then the resulting $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$-representation would be projective as well. Instead, the isomorphism $σ: \mathbf{ so } (3, 1) → \mathbf{ sl } (3, \mathbf{ C } )$ can be employed, composed with $exp: \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) → SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$. This is always a non-projective representation.
Properties of the (m, n) representations
The $( m , n )$ representations are $(2 m + 1)(2 n + 1)$-dimensional,67 irreducible, and they are the only irreducible representations.68

Irreducibility follows from the unitarian trick69 and that a representation $Π$ of $SU(2) × SU(2)$ is irreducible if and only if  Πμ ⊗ Πν}},70 where  are irreducible representations of $SU(2)$.
Uniqueness follows from that the  are the only irreducible representations of $SU(2)$, which is one of the conclusions of the theorem of the highest weight.71
The dimensionality follows from the Weyl dimension formula. For a Lie algebra $\mathbf{ g } $ it reads

$\operatorname{dim}\pi_\mu = \frac{\Pi_{\alpha \in R^+} \langle\alpha, \mu + \delta \rangle}{\Pi_{\alpha \in R^+} \langle\alpha, \delta \rangle},$72
where  is the set of positive roots and $δ$ is half the sum of the positive roots. The inner product $$ is that of the Lie algebra $\mathbf{ g } $, invariant under the action of the Weyl group on $\mathbf{ h } ⊂ \mathbf{ g } $, the Cartan subalgebra. The roots (really elements of $\mathbf{ h } *)$ are via this inner product identified with elements of $\mathbf{ h } $. For $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, the formula reduces to  μ + 1 {{=}} 2m + 1}}.73 By taking tensor products, the result follows. A quicker approach is, of course, to simply count the dimensions in any concrete realization, such as the one given in Representations of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ and $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$.
Faithfulness
If a representation $Π$ of a Lie group $G$ is not faithful, then $N = ker Π$ is a nontrivial normal subgroup because  I ⇒ Π(gng−1) {{=}} Π(g)Π(n)Π(g)−1 {{=}} Π(g)Π(g)−1 {{=}} I}}. There are three relevant cases.

$N$ is non-discrete and abelian.
$N$ is non-discrete and non-abelian.
$N$ is discrete. In this case $N ⊂ Z$, where $Z$ is the center of $G$.74

In the case of , the first case is excluded since  is semi-simple.75 The second case (and the first case) is excluded because  is simple.76 For the third case,  is isomorphic to the quotient . But  is the center of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$. It follows that the center of  is trivial, and this excludes the third case. The conclusion is that every representation  and every projective representation  for $V , W$ finite-dimensional vector spaces are faithful.
By using the fundamental Lie correspondence, the statements and the reasoning above translate directly to Lie algebras with (abelian) nontrivial non-discrete normal subgroups replaced by (one-dimensional) nontrivial ideals in the Lie algebra,77 and the center of  replaced by the center of . The center of any semisimple Lie algebra is trivial78 and $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$ is semi-simple and simple, and hence has no non-trivial ideals.
Non-unitarity
The $( m , n )$ Lie algebra representation is not Hermitian. Accordingly, the corresponding (projective) representation of the group is never unitary. This is due to the non-compactness of the Lorentz group. A connected simple non-compact Lie group cannot have any nontrivial finite-dimensional irreducible representations.79 There is a topological proof of this.80 Let $U : G → GL( V )$, where $V$ is finite-dimensional, be a continuous unitary representation of the non-compact connected simple Lie group $G$. Then $U ( G ) ⊂ U( V ) ⊂ GL( V )$ where $U( V )$ is the compact subgroup of $GL( V )$ consisting of unitary transformations of $v )$. The kernel, $ker U$, of $U$ is a normal subgroup of $G$. Since $G$ is simple, $ker U$ is either all of $G$, in which case $U$ is trivial, or $ker U$ is trivial, in which case $U$ is faithful. In the latter case $U$ is a diffeomorphism onto its image,81 $U ( G ) ≈ G .$, and $U ( G )$ is Lie group. This would mean that $U ( G )$ is an embedded non-compact Lie subgroup of the compact group $U( V )$. This is impossible with the subspace topology on $U ( G ) ⊂ U( V )$ since all embedded Lie subgroups of a Lie group are closed82 If $U ( G )$ were closed, it would be compact,83 and the $G$ would be compact,84 contrary to assumption.
In the case of the Lorentz group, this can also be seen directly from the definitions. The representations of $\mathbf{ A } $ and $\mathbf{ B } $ used in the construction are Hermitian. This means that $\mathbf{ J } $ is Hermitian, but $\mathbf{ K } $ is anti-Hermitian.85 The non-unitarity is not a problem in quantum field theory, since the objects of concern are not required to have a Lorentz-invariant positive definite norm.86
Restriction to SO(3)
The $( m , n )$ representation is, however, unitary when restricted to the rotation subgroup $SO(3)$, but these representations are not irreducible as representations of SO(3). A Clebsch–Gordan decomposition can be applied showing that an $( m , n )$ representation have $SO(3)$-invariant subspaces of highest weight (spin) $m + n , m + n − 1, … , | m − n |$,87 where each possible highest weight (spin) occurs exactly once. A weight subspace of highest weight (spin) $j$ is $(2 j + 1)$-dimensional. So for example, the ($\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{2}$) representation has spin 1 and spin 0 subspaces of dimension 3 and 1 respectively.
Since the angular momentum operator is given by $\mathbf{ J } = \mathbf{ A } + \mathbf{ B } $, the highest spin in quantum mechanics of the rotation sub-representation will be $( m + n )ℏ$ and the "usual" rules of addition of angular momenta and the formalism of 3-j symbols, 6-j symbols, etc. applies.88
Spinors
It is the $SO(3)$-invariant subspaces subspaces of the irreducible representations that determine whether a representation has spin. From the above paragraph, it is seen that the $( m , n )$ representation has spin if $m + n$ is half-integral. The simplest are $( \frac{1}{2} , 0)$ and $(0, \frac{1}{2} )$, the Weyl-spinors of dimension $2$. Then, for example, $(0, \frac{3}{2} )$ and $(1, \frac{1}{2} )$ are a spin representations of dimensions $2 \frac{3}{2} + 1 = 4$ and $(2 + 1)(2 \frac{1}{2} + 1) = 6$ respectively. Note that, according to the above paragraph, there are subspaces with spin both $\frac{3}{2}$ and $\frac{1}{2}$ in the last two cases, so these representations cannot likely represent a single physical particle which must be well-behaved under $SO(3)$.
Construction of pure spin $\frac{n}{2}$ representations for any $n$ (under $SO(3)$) from the irreducible representations involves taking tensor products of the Dirac-representation with a non-spin representation, extraction of a suitable subspace, and finally imposing differential constraints.89
Dual representations
 To see if the dual representation of an irreducible representation is equivalent to the original representation one can consider the following theorems:

The set of weights of the dual representation of an irreducible representation of a semisimple Lie algebra is, including multiplicities, the negative of the set of weights for the original representation.90
Two irreducible representations are equivalent if and only if they have the same highest weight.91
For each semisimple Lie algebra there exists a unique element  of the Weyl group such that if $μ$ is a dominant integral weight, then  is again a dominant integral weight.92
If  is an irreducible representation with highest weight , then  has highest weight .93

Here, the elements of the Weyl group are considered as orthogonal transformations, acting by matrix multiplication, on the real vector space of roots. One sees that if $− I$ is an element of the Weyl group of a semisimple Lie algebra, then  −I}}. In the case of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, the Weyl group is .94 It follows that each  0, 1, …}} is equivalent to its dual . The root system of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } ) ⊕ \mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$ is shown in the figure to the right.95 The Weyl group is generated by  where  is reflection in the plane orthogonal to $γ$ as $γ$ ranges over all roots.96 One sees that  −I}} so $− I ∈ W$. Then using the fact that if $π, σ$ are Lie algebra representations and $π ≈ σ$, then $Π ≈ Σ$.97 The conclusion for  is
$$\pi_{m, n}^{*} \cong \pi_{m, n}, \quad \Pi_{m, n}^{*} \cong \Pi_{m, n}, \quad 2m, 2n \in \mathbb{N}.$$
Complex conjugate representations
If $π$ is a representation of a Lie algebra, then $\overline{π}$ is a representation, where the bar denotes entry-wise complex conjugation in the representative matrices. This follows from that complex conjugation commutes with addition and multiplication.98 In general, every irreducible representation $π$ of $\mathbf{ sl } ( n , \mathbf{ C } )$ can be written uniquely as  π+ + π−}}, where
$$\pi^{\pm}(X) = \frac{1}{2}(\pi(X) \pm i\pi(i^{-1}X)),$$99
with  holomorphic (complex linear) and  anti-holomorphic (conjugate linear). For $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$, since  is holomorphic,  is anti-holomorphic. Direct examination of the explicit expressions for  and  in equation  below shows that they are holomorphic and anti-holomorphic respectively. Closer examination of the expression  also allows for identification of  and  for  as  πμ⊕ν + 1}} and  ν⊕μ + 1}}.
Using the above identities (interpreted as pointwise addition of functions), for  yields
$$\overline{\pi_{m, n}} = \overline{\pi_{m, n}^+ + \pi_{m, n}^-} = 
 \overline{\pi_m^{\oplus_{2n + 1}}} + \overline{\overline{\pi_n}^{\oplus_{2m + 1}}} = 
 \pi_n^{\oplus_{2m + 1}} + \overline{\pi_m}^{\oplus_{2n + 1}} = \pi_{n, m}^+ + \pi_{n, m}^- = 
 \pi_{n, m}, \quad \overline{\Pi_{m, n}} = \Pi_{n, m}, \quad 2m, 2n \in \mathbb{N},$$ where the statement for the group representations follow from $exp( \overline{X} )$ = $\overline{exp(}{X}{)}$. It follows that the irreducible representations $( m , n )$ have real matrix representatives if and only if $m = n$. Reducible representations on the form $( m , n ) ⊕ ( n , m )$ have real matrices too.
Induced representations
 In general representation theory, if $( π , V )$ is a representation of a Lie algebra g, then there is an associated representation of g on $End V$, also denoted $π$, given by
Likewise, a representation $(Π, V )$ of a group $G$ yields a representation $Π$ on $End V$ of $G$, still denoted $Π$, given by
Applying this to the Lorentz group, if $(Π, V )$ is a projective representation, then direct calculation using (G4) shows that the induced representation on $End V$ is, in fact, a proper representation, i.e. a representation without phase factors.
In quantum mechanics this means that if $( π , H )$ or $(Π, H )$ is a representation acting on some Hilbert space $H$, then the corresponding induced representation acts on the set of linear operators on $H$. As an example, the induced representation of the projective spin $( \frac{1}{2} , 0) ⊕ (0, \frac{1}{2} )$ representation on $End( H )$ is the non-projective 4-vector ($\frac{1}{2}$, $\frac{1}{2}$) representation.100
For simplicity, consider now only the "discrete part" of $End H$, that is, given a basis for $H$, the set of constant matrices of various dimension, including possibly infinite dimensions. A general element of the full $End H$ is the sum of tensor products of a matrix from the simplified $End H$ and an operator from the left out part. The left out part consists of functions of spacetime, differential and integral operators and the like. See Dirac operator for an illustrative example. Also left out are operators corresponding to other degrees of freedom not related to spacetime, such as gauge degrees of freedom in gauge theories.
The induced 4-vector representation of above on this simplified $End H$ has an invariant 4-dimensional subspace that is spanned by the four gamma matrices.101 (Note the different metric convention in the linked article.) In a corresponding way, the complete Clifford algebra of spacetime, , whose complexification is , generated by the gamma matrices decomposes as a direct sum of representation spaces of a scalar irreducible representation (irrep), the $(0, 0)$, a pseudoscalar irrep, also the $(0, 0)$, but with parity inversion eigenvalue −1, see the next section below, the already mentioned vector irrep, $( \frac{1}{2} , , \frac{1}{2} )$, a pseudovector irrep, $( \frac{1}{2} , \frac{1}{2} )$ with parity inversion eigenvalue +1 (not −1), and a tensor irrep, $(1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1)$.102 The dimensions add up to $1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 6 = 16$. In other words,
where, as is customary, a representation is confused with its representation space. This is, in fact, a reasonably convenient way to show that the algebra spanned by the gammas is 16-dimensional.103
The six-dimensional representation space of the tensor $(1, 0) ⊕ (0, 1)$-representation inside  has two roles. In particular, letting
where  are the gamma matrices, the , only 6 of which are non-zero due to antisymmetry of the bracket, span the tensor representation space. Moreover, they have the commutation relations of the Lorentz Lie algebra,
and hence constitute a representation (in addition to being a representation space) sitting inside , the $( \frac{1}{2} , 0) ⊕ (0, \frac{1}{2} )$ spin representation. For details, see bispinor and Dirac algebra.
The conclusion is that every element of the complexified  in $End H$ (i.e. every complex  matrix) has well defined Lorentz transformation properties. In addition, it has a spin-representation of the Lorentz Lie algebra, which upon exponentiation becomes a spin representation of the group, acting on , making it a space of bispinors.
There is also a multitude of other representations that can be said being "induced" by the irreducible ones, such as those obtained in a standard manner by taking direct sums, tensor products, dual representations, quotients, etc. of the irreducible representations. These are not discussed here.
The full Lorentz group
The (possibly projective) $( m , n )$ representation is irreducible as a representation , the identity component of the Lorentz group, in physics terminology the proper orthochronous Lorentz group. If $ m = n$ it can be extended to a representation of all of $O(3,1)$, the full Lorentz group, including space parity inversion and time reversal.104
Space parity inversion
For space parity inversion, one considers the adjoint action  of $P ∈ O(3,1)$ on $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$, where $P$ is the standard representative of space parity inversion, $ P = diag(1, −1, −1, −1)$, given by
It is these properties of $\mathbf{ K } $ and $\mathbf{ J } $ under $P$ that motivate the terms vector for $\mathbf{ K } $ and pseudovector or axial vector for $\mathbf{ J } $. In a similar way, if $π$ is any representation of $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$ and $Π$ is its associated group representation, then  acts on the representation of $π$ by the adjoint action,  for $X ∈ \mathbf{ so } (3;1)$, . If $P$ is to be included in $Π$, then consistency with  requires that
holds, where $\mathbf{ A } $ and $\mathbf{ B } $ are defined as in the first section. This can hold only if  and  have the same dimensions, i.e. only if $ m = n$. When $m ≠ n$ then $( m , n ) ⊕ ( n , m )$ can be extended to an irreducible representation of , the orthocronous Lorentz group. The parity reversal representative $Π( P )$ does not come automatically with the general construction of the $( m , n )$ representations. It must be specified separately. The matrix  (or a multiple of modulus −1 times it) may be used in the $( \frac{1}{2} , 0) ⊕ (0, \frac{1}{2} )$105 representation. If parity is included with a minus sign in the $(0,0)$ representation, it is called a pseudoscalar representation.
Time reversal
Time reversal $ T = diag(−1, 1, 1, 1)$, acts similarly on $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$ by
By explicitly including a representative for $T$, as well as one for $P$, one obtains a representation of the full Lorentz group $O(3, 1)$. A subtle problem appears however in application to physics, in particular quantum mechanics. When considering the full Poincaré group, four more generators, the , in addition to the  and  generate the group. These are interpreted as generators of translations. The time-component  is the Hamiltonian $H$. The operator $T$ satisfies the relation
in analogy to the relations above with $\mathbf{ so } (3, 1)$ replaced by the full Poincaré algebra. By just cancelling the $i$'s, the result  would imply that for every state $Ψ$ with positive energy $E$ in a Hilbert space of quantum states with time-reversal invariance, there would be a state  with negative energy $− E$. Such states do not exist. The operator $Π( T )$ is therefore chosen antilinear and antiunitary, so that it anticommutes with $i$, resulting in  = $+ H$, and its action on Hilbert space likewise becomes antilinear and antiunitary.106 It may be expressed as the composition of complex conjugation with multiplication by a unitary matrix.107108 This is mathematically sound, see Wigner's theorem, but if one is very strict with terminology, $Π$ is not a representation.
When constructing theories such as QED which is invariant under space parity and time reversal, Dirac spinors may be used, while theories that do not, such as the electroweak force, must be formulated in terms of Weyl spinors. The Dirac representation, , is usually taken to include both space parity and time inversions. Without space parity inversion, it is not an irreducible representation.
The third discrete symmetry entering in the CPT theorem along with $P$ and $T$, charge conjugation symmetry $C$, has nothing directly to do with Lorentz invariance.109
Infinite-dimensional representations
History
The Lorentz group  and its double cover $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ also have infinite dimensional unitary representations, first studied independently by ,  and  at the instigation of Paul Dirac. This trail of development begun with  where he devised matrices $\mathbf{ U } $ and $\mathbf{ B } $ necessary for description of higher spin (compare Dirac matrices), elaborated upon by , see also , and proposed precursors of the Bargmann-Wigner equations. In  he proposed a concrete infinite-dimensional representation space whose elements were called expansors as a generalization of tensors. These ideas were incorporated by Harish–Chandra and expanded with expinors as an infinite-dimensional generalization of spinors in his 1947 paper.
The Plancherel formula for these groups was first obtained by Gelfand and Naimark through involved calculations. The treatment was subsequently considerably simplified by  and , based on an analogue for $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ of the integration formula of Hermann Weyl for compact Lie groups. Elementary accounts of this approach can be found in  and .
The theory of spherical functions for the Lorentz group, required for harmonic analysis on the 3-dimensional unit quasi-sphere in Minkowski space, or equivalently 3-dimensional hyperbolic space, is considerably easier than the general theory. It only involves representations from the spherical principal series and can be treated directly, because in radial coordinates the Laplacian on the hyperboloid is equivalent to the Laplacian on $\mathbf{ R } $. This theory is discussed in , ,  and the posthumous text of .
Action on function spaces
In the classification of the irreducible finite-dimensional representations of above it was never specified precisely how a representative of a group or Lie algebra element acts on vectors in the representation space. The action can be anything as long as it is linear. The point silently adopted was that after a choice of basis in the representation space, everything becomes matrices anyway.
If $V$ is a vector space of functions of a finite number of variables $n$, then the action on a scalar function $f ∈ V$ given by  produces another function $Π f ∈ V$. Here  is an $n$-dimensional representation, and $Π$ is a possibly infinite-dimensional representation. A special case of this construction is when $V$ is a space of functions defined on the group $G$ itself, viewed as a $n$-dimensional manifold embedded in .110 This is the setting in which the Peter–Weyl theorem and the Borel–Weil theorem are formulated. The former demonstrates the existence of a Fourier decomposition of functions on a compact group into characters of finite-dimensional representations.111 The completeness of the characters in this sense can thus be used to prove the existence of the highest weight representations.112 The latter theorem, providing more explicit representations, makes use of the unitarian trick to yield representations of complex non-compact groups, e.g. $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$; in the present case, there is a one-to-one correspondence between representations of $SU(2)$ and holomorphic representations of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$. (A group representation is called holomorphic if its corresponding Lie algebra representation is complex linear.) This theorem too can be used to demonstrate the existence of the highest weight representations.113
Euclidean rotations
The subgroup $SO(3)$ of three-dimensional Euclidean rotations has an infinite-dimensional representation on the Hilbert space , where the  are spherical harmonics. Its elements are square integrable complex-valued functions114 on the sphere. The inner product on this space is given by 
If $f$ is an arbitrary square integrable function defined on the unit sphere , then it can be expressed as115  where the expansion coefficients are given by 
The Lorentz group action restricts to that of $SO(3)$ and is expressed as 
This action is unitary, meaning that  The  can be obtained from the  of above using Clebsch–Gordan decomposition, but they are more easily directly expressed as an exponential of an odd-dimensional $\mathbf{ su } (2)$-representation (the 3-dimensional one is exactly $\mathbf{ so } (3)$).116117 In this case the space  decomposes neatly into an infinite direct sum of irreducible odd finite-dimensional representations  0, 1, …}} according to 
This is characteristic of infinite-dimensional unitary representations of $SO(3)$. If $Π$ is an infinite-dimensional unitary representation on a separable118 Hilbert space, then it decomposes as a direct sum of finite-dimensional unitary representations.119 Such a representation is thus never irreducible. All irreducible finite-dimensional representations $(Π, V )$ can be made unitary by an appropriate choice of inner product,120
$$\langle f, g\rangle_U \equiv \int_{\mathrm{SO}(3)}\langle \Pi(R)f, \Pi(R)g\rangle dg = \frac{1}{8\pi^2}\int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \langle \Pi(R)f, \Pi(R)g\rangle \sin \theta d\varphi d\theta d\psi, \quad f,g \in V,$$ where the integral is the unique invariant integral over $SO(3)$ normalized to $1$, here expressed using the Euler angles parametrization. The inner product inside the integral is any inner product on $V$.
The Möbius group
The identity component of the Lorentz group is isomorphic to the Möbius group $M$ as is described in detail in Lorentz group. This group can be thought of as conformal mappings of either the complex plane or, via stereographic projection, the Riemann sphere. In this way, the Lorentz group itself can be thought of as acting conformally on the complex plane or on the Riemann sphere. In the plane, a Möbius transformation characterized by the complex numbers $a , b , c , d$ acts on the plane according to  and can be represented by complex matrices  These are elements of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ and are unique up to a sign and . The conformal mappings of the Riemann sphere are thoroughly described in Möbius transformations.
The Riemann P-functions
The Riemann P-functions are an example of a set of functions that transform among themselves under the action of the Lorentz (Möbius) group. The Riemann P-functions are expressed as
where the $a , b , c , α , β , γ , α′ , β′ , γ′$ are complex constants. The P-function on the right hand side can be expressed using standard hypergeometric functions giving
Now define an action of the Lorentz group on the set of all Riemann P-functions by 
and
where $A , B , C , D$ are the entries in
where, $Λ$ is a Lorentz transformation and  is the corresponding Möbius transformation, and, finally,  is one of the two possible $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ matrices corresponding to it, then one has the relation
expressing the symmetry. The inverse in  is needed to obtain a (local) homomorphism.
Principal series
The principal series, or unitary principal series, are the unitary representations induced from the one-dimensional representations of the lower triangular subgroup $B$ of $ G = SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$. Since the one-dimensional representations of $B$ correspond to the representations of the diagonal matrices, with non-zero complex entries $z$ and , they thus have the form
$$\chi_{\nu,k}\begin{pmatrix}z& 0\\ c& z^{-1}\end{pmatrix}=r^{i\nu} e^{ik\theta},$$
for $k$ an integer, $ν$ real and with . The representations are irreducible; the only repetitions occur when $k$ is replaced by $− k$. By definition the representations are realized on L2 sections of line bundles on , which is isomorphic to the Riemann sphere. When $ k = 0$, these representations constitute the so-called spherical principal series.
The restriction of a principal series to the maximal compact subgroup $ K = SU(2)$ of $G$ can also be realized as an induced representation of $K$ using the identification $ G / B = K / T$, where $ T = B ∩ K$ is the maximal torus in $K$ consisting of diagonal matrices with $ | z | = 1$. It is the representation induced from the 1-dimensional representation , and is independent of $ν$. By Frobenius reciprocity, on $K$ they decompose as a direct sum of the irreducible representations of $K$ with dimensions $ | k | + 2 m + 1$ with $m$ a non-negative integer.
Using the identification between the Riemann sphere minus a point and $\mathbf{ C } $, the principal series can be defined directly on  by the formula
$$\pi_{\nu,k}\begin{pmatrix}a& b\\ c& d\end{pmatrix}^{-1}f(z)=|cz+d|^{-2-i\nu} \left({cz+d\over |cz+d|}\right)^{-k}f\left({az+b\over cz+d}\right).$$121
Irreducibility can be checked in a variety of ways:

The representation is already irreducible on $B$. This can be seen directly, but is also a special case of general results on ireducibility of induced representations due to François Bruhat and George Mackey, relying on the Bruhat decomposition $ G = B ∪ B s B$ where $s$ is the Weyl group element $\begin{pmatrix}0& -1\\ 1& 0\end{pmatrix}$.122


The action of the Lie algebra $\mathfrak{g}$ of $G$ can be computed on the algebraic direct sum of the irreducible subspaces of $K$ can be computed explicitly and the it can be verified directly that the lowest-dimensional subspace generates this direct sum as a $\mathfrak{g}$-module.123124

Complementary series
The for $0 , the complementary series is defined on  functions $f$ on $\mathbf{ C } $ for the inner product
$$(f,g)=\int \int {f(z) \overline{g(w)}\, dz\, dw\over |z-w|^{2-t}}.$$125
with the action given by
$$\pi_{t}\begin{pmatrix}a& b\\ c& d\end{pmatrix}^{-1}f(z)=|cz+d|^{-2-t} f\left({az+b\over cz+d}\right).$$126127
The complementary series are irreducible and inequivalent. As a representation of $K$, each is isomorphic to the Hilbert space direct sum of all the odd dimensional irreducible representations of $ K = SU(2)$. Irreducibility can be proved by analyzing the action of $\mathfrak{g}$ on the algebraic sum of these subspaces128129 or directly without using the Lie algebra.130131
Plancherel theorem
 The only irreducible unitary representations of $SL(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ are the principal series, the complementary series and the trivial representation. Since $− I$ acts  on the principal series and trivially on the remainder, these will give all the irreducible unitary representations of the Lorentz group, provided $k$ is taken to be even.
To decompose the left regular representation of $G$ on , only the principal series are required. This immediately yields the decomposition on the subrepresentations , the left regular representation of the Lorentz group, and , the regular representation on 3-dimensional hyperbolic space. (The former only involves principal series representations with k even and the latter only those with $ k = 0$.)
The left and right regular representation $λ$ and $ρ$ are defined on  by
$$\lambda(g)f(x)=f(g^{-1}x),\,\,\rho(g)f(x)=f(xg).$$
Now if $f$ is an element of , the operator  defined by
$$\pi_{\nu,k}(f)=\int_G f(g)\pi(g)\, dg$$
is Hilbert–Schmidt. We define a Hilbert space $H$ by
$$H=\bigoplus_{k\ge 0} HS(L^2(C)) \otimes L^2(R, c_k(\nu^2 + k^2)^{1/2} d\nu),$$
where
$$c_0=1/4\pi^{3/2}, \,\, c_k=1/(2\pi)^{3/2}\,\,(k\ne 0)$$
and  denotes the Hilbert space of Hilbert–Schmidt operators on .132 Then the map $U$ defined on  by
$$U(f)(\nu,k) = \pi_{\nu,k}(f)$$
extends to a unitary of  onto $H$.
The map $U$ satisfies
$$U(\lambda(x)\rho(y)f)(\nu,k) = \pi_{\nu,k}(x)^{-1} \pi_{\nu,k}(f)\pi_{\nu,k}(y).$$
If ,  are in  then
$$(f_1,f_2) = \sum_{k\ge 0} c_k^2 \int_{-\infty}^\infty {\rm Tr}(\pi_{\nu,k}(f_1)\pi_{\nu,k}(f_2)^*) (\nu^2 +k^2) \, d\nu.$$
Thus if  denotes the convolution of  and , and $f_2^*(g)=\overline{f_2(g^{-1})}$, then
$$f(1) = \sum_{k\ge 0} c_k^2 \int_{-\infty}^\infty  {\rm Tr}(\pi_{\nu,k}(f)) (\nu^2+k^2)\, d\nu.$$
The last two displayed formulas are usually referred to as the Plancherel formula and the Fourier inversion formula respectively. The Plancherel formula extends to all  in . By a theorem of Jacques Dixmier and Paul Malliavin, every function $f$ in $C^\infty_c(G)$ is a finite sum of convolutions of similar functions, the inversion formula holds for such $f$. It can be extended to much wider classes of functions satisfying mild differentiability conditions.133
Explicit formulas
Conventions and Lie algebra bases
The metric of choice is given by $η$ = $diag(−1, 1, 1, 1)$, and the physics convention for Lie algebras and the exponential mapping is used in this article. These choices are arbitrary, but once they are made, fixed. The rationale is to allow the use of a single reference134 for several related formulas. One possible choice of basis for the Lie algebra (which is not fixed by the reference) is, in the 4-vector representation, given by
$$\begin{align}
 J_1 &= J^{23} = -J^{32} = i\biggl(\begin{smallmatrix}
 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&-1\\ 0&0&1&0\\
 \end{smallmatrix}\biggr),\\
 J_2 &= J^{31} = -J^{13} = i\biggl(\begin{smallmatrix}
 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&1\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&-1&0&0\\
 \end{smallmatrix}\biggr),\\
 J_3 &= J^{12} = -J^{21} = i\biggl(\begin{smallmatrix}
 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&-1&0\\ 0&1&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\
 \end{smallmatrix}\biggr),\\
 K_1 &= J^{01} = J^{10} = i\biggl(\begin{smallmatrix}
 0&1&0&0\\ 1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\
 \end{smallmatrix}\biggr),\\
 K_2 &= J^{02} = J^{20} = i\biggl(\begin{smallmatrix}
 0&0&1&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 1&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\
 \end{smallmatrix}\biggr),\\
 K_3 &= J^{03} = J^{30} = i\biggl(\begin{smallmatrix}
 0&0&0&1\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 0&0&0&0\\ 1&0&0&0\\
 \end{smallmatrix}\biggr).
 \end{align}$$
The commutation relations of the Lie algebra so(3;1) are
$$[J^{\mu\nu},J^{\rho\sigma}] = i(\eta^{\sigma\mu}J^{\rho\nu} + \eta^{\nu\sigma}J^{\mu\rho} - \eta^{\rho\mu}J^{\sigma\nu} -\eta^{\nu\rho}J^{\mu\sigma}).$$135
In three-dimensional notation, these are
$$[J_i,J_j] = i\epsilon_{ijk}J_k, \quad [J_i,K_j] = i\epsilon_{ijk}K_k, \quad [K_i,K_j] = -i\epsilon_{ijk}J_k.$$136
The choice of basis above satisfies the relations, but other choices are possible. The multiple use of the symbol $J$ above and in the sequel should be observed.
Let , where $V$ is a vector space, denote the irreducible representations of $\mathbf{ so } (3;1)$ according to the $( m , n )$ classification. In components, with $− m ≤ a , a′ ≤ m$, $− n ≤ b , b′ ≤ n$, the representations are given by
$$\begin{align}
 (\pi_{m,n}(J_i))_{a'b' , ab} &= \delta_{b'b}(J_i^{(m)})_{a'a} + \delta_{a'a}(J_i^{(n)})_{b'b},\\
 (\pi_{m,n}(K_i))_{a'b' , ab} &= i(\delta_{a'a}(J_i^{(n)})_{b'b} - \delta_{b'b}(J_i^{(m)})_{a'a}),
 \end{align}$$137
where $δ$ is the Kronecker delta and the  are the $(2 n + 1)$-dimensional irreducible representations of $\mathbf{ so } (3)$, also termed spin matrices or angular momentum matrices. These are explicitly given by
$$\begin{align}
 (J_3^{(j)})_{a'a} &= a\delta_{a'a},\\
 (J_1^{(j)} \pm iJ_2^{(j)})_{a'a} &= \sqrt{(j \mp a)(j \pm a + 1)}\delta_{a',a \pm 1}.
 \end{align}$$138
Weyl spinors and bispinors
 By taking, in turn, $m = \frac{1}{2}$, $n = 0$ and $m = 0$, $n = \frac{1}{2}$ and by setting
$$J_i^{(\frac{1}{2})} = \frac{1}{2}\sigma_i$$
in the general expression , and by using the trivial relations  1}} and  0}}, one obtains
These are the left-handed and right-handed Weyl spinor representations. They act by matrix multiplication on 2-dimensional complex vector spaces (with a choice of basis)  and , whose elements  and  are called left- and right-handed Weyl spinors respectively. Given  and  one may form their direct sum as representations,
This is, up to a similarity transformation, the $( \frac{1}{2} ,0) ⊕ (0, \frac{1}{2} )$ Dirac spinor representation of $\mathbf{ so } (3,1)$. It acts on the 4-component elements  of , called bispinors, by matrix multiplication. The representation may be obtained in a more general and basis independent way using Clifford algebras. These expressions for bispinors and Weyl spinors all extend by linearity of Lie algebras and representations to all of $\mathbf{ so } (3,1)$. Expressions for the group representations are obtained by exponentiation.

 From Section 2.1 Example 4: This can be seen as follows. The matrix q has eigenvalues , but it is not diagonalizable. If $q = exp( Q )$, then $Q$ has eigenvalues $λ, −λ$ with $λ = iπ + 2π ik$ for some $k$ because the tracelessness of $\mathbf{ sl } (2, \mathbf{ C } )$-matrices forces them to be negatives of each other. But then $Q$ is diagonalizable, hence $q$ is diagonalizable. This is a contradiction.↩
