   Glutathione synthase      Glutathione synthase   In enzymology , a glutathione synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine + glycine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + glutathione   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine , and glycine , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and glutathione .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteine:glycine ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include glutathione synthetase , and GSH synthetase . This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and glutathione metabolism . At least one compound, Phosphinate is known to inhibit this enzyme .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
