Cross fluid




Cross fluid

A Cross fluid is a type of generalized Newtonian fluid whose viscosity depends upon shear rate according to the following equation:



where


 
  is viscosity as a function of shear rate,


 
 , 
 
 
 
  and n are coefficients.
At low shear rate (
 
 
 
 ), cross fluids behave as Newtonian fluids and at high shear rate (
 
 
 
 ) as power-law fluids.
