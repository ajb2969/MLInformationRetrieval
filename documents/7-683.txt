Active networking

Active networking is a communication pattern that allows packets flowing through a telecommunications network to dynamically modify the operation of the network.
How it works
Active network architecture is composed of execution environments (similar to a unix shell that can execute active packets), a node operating system capable of supporting one or more execution environments. It also consists of active hardware, capable of routing or switching as well as executing code within active packets. This differs from the traditional network architecture which seeks robustness and stability by attempting to remove complexity and the ability to change its fundamental operation from underlying network components. Network processors are one means of implementing active networking concepts. Active networks have also been implemented as overlay networks.
What does it offer?
Active networking allows the possibility of highly tailored and rapid "real-time" changes to the underlying network operation. This enables such ideas as sending code along with packets of information allowing the data to change its form (code) to match the channel characteristics. The smallest program that can generate a sequence of data can be found in the definition of Kolmogorov complexity. The use of real-time genetic algorithms within the network to compose network services is also enabled by active networking.
Fundamental challenges
Active network research addresses the nature of how best to incorporate extremely dynamic capability within networks.1
In order to do this, active network research must address the problem of optimally allocating computation versus communication within communication networks.2 A similar problem related to the compression of code as a measure of complexity is addressed via algorithmic information theory.
One of the challenges of active networking has been the inability of information theory to mathematically model the active network paradigm and enable active network engineering. This is due to the active nature of the network in which communication packets contain code that dynamically change the operation of the network. Fundamental advances in information theory are required in order to understand such networks.3

Nanoscale active networks
As the limit in reduction of transistor size is reached with current technology, active networking concepts are being explored as a more efficient means accomplishing computation and communication.56 More on this can be found in nanoscale networking.
