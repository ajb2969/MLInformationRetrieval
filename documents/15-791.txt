NADP-retinol dehydrogenase




NADP-retinol dehydrogenase

NADP-retinol dehydrogenase (, all-trans retinal reductase, all-trans-retinol dehydrogenase, NADP(H)-dependent retinol dehydrogenase/reductase, RDH11, RDH12, RDH13, RDH14, retinol dehydrogenase 12, retinol dehydrogenase 14, retinol dehydrogenase (NADP+), RalR1, PSDR1) is an enzyme with system name retinol:NADP+ oxidoreductase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

retinol + NADP+

 
  retinal + NADPH + H+


This enzyme has greater catalytic efficiency in the reductive direction.
