Orders of magnitude (data)

An order of magnitude is a factor of ten. A quantity growing by four orders of magnitude implies it has grown by a factor of 10000 or 104.
This article presents a list of multiples, sorted by orders of magnitude, for digital information storage measured in bits. This article assumes a descriptive attitude towards terminology, reflecting general usage. The article assumes the following:

A group of 8 bits constitutes one byte. The byte is the most common unit of measurement of information (megabyte, mebibyte, gigabyte, gibibyte, etc.).
In 16-bit and 32-bit architectures, having processor registers of these sizes, that chunk of data is usually called a word.
The decimal SI prefixes kilo, mega etc., are powers of 10. The binary prefixes kibi, mebi, etc. respectively refer to similar multiples.

Accordingly:

1 kB (kilobyte) = 1000 bytes = 8000 bits
1 KiB (kibibyte) = 210 bytes = 1024 bytes = 8192 bits

Note: this page mixes between two kinds of entropies:

Entropy (information theory), such as the amount of information that can be stored in DNA
Entropy (thermodynamics), such as entropy increase of 1 mole of water

These two definitions are not entirely equivalent, see Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory.
For comparison, the Avogadro constant is  entities per mole, based upon the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 isotope.
In 2012, hard disks used about one million atoms to store one bit. In January 2012, IBM researchers announced they had achieved the storage of 1 bit in just 12 atoms using antiferromagnetism and a scanning tunneling microscope with iron and copper atoms. This could mean a practical jump from a  disk to a  disk.12
