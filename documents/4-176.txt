   Orders of magnitude (data)      Orders of magnitude (data)   An order of magnitude is a factor of ten. A quantity growing by four orders of magnitude implies it has grown by a factor of 10000 or 10 4 .  This article presents a list of multiples, sorted by orders of magnitude, for digital information storage measured in bits . This article assumes a descriptive attitude towards terminology, reflecting general usage. The article assumes the following:   A group of 8 bits constitutes one byte . The byte is the most common unit of measurement of information ( megabyte , mebibyte , gigabyte , gibibyte , etc.).  In 16-bit and 32-bit architectures , having processor registers of these sizes, that chunk of data is usually called a word .  The decimal SI prefixes  kilo , mega etc., are powers of 10. The binary prefixes  kibi , mebi , etc. respectively refer to similar multiples.   Accordingly:   1 kB ( kilobyte ) = 1000 bytes = 8000 bits  1 KiB ( kibibyte ) = 2 10 bytes = 1024 bytes = 8192 bits   {{-}}      Orders of magnitude (data)     Binary [bits]     Factor     2 0           2 1        2 2              2 3           2 4     2 5           2 6           2 7        2 8     2 9        2 10        2 11     2 12           2 13           2 14     2 15     2 16        2 17        2 18     2 19        2 20        2 21        2 22                    2 23           2 24           2 25                 2 26     2 27        2 28           2 29        2 30     2 31     2 32                    2 33        2 34     2 35        2 36           2 37           2 38     2 39        2 40        2 41     2 42        2 43              2 44     2 45     2 46        2 47        2 48     2 49        2 50     2 51     2 52        2 53        2 54     2 55        2 56           2 57        2 58     2 59           2 60           2 61        2 62     2 63        2 64     2 65        2 66           2 67     2 68        2 69        2 70     2 71           2 72     2 73        2 76              2 80           2 150              2 305     2 332.1928     2 3.321928· googol       Note: this page mixes between two kinds of entropies:   Entropy (information theory) , such as the amount of information that can be stored in DNA  Entropy (thermodynamics) , such as entropy increase of 1 mole of water   These two definitions are not entirely equivalent, see Entropy in thermodynamics and information theory .  For comparison, the Avogadro constant is  entities per mole, based upon the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12 isotope.  In 2012, hard disks used about one million atoms to store one bit. In January 2012, IBM researchers announced they had achieved the storage of 1 bit in just 12 atoms using antiferromagnetism and a scanning tunneling microscope with iron and copper atoms. This could mean a practical jump from a  disk to a  disk. 1 2  See also   SI prefix  Data rate units  Orders of magnitude (entropy)   References  "  Data      ↩
