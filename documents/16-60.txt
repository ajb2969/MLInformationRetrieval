   Beta-selinene cyclase      Beta-selinene cyclase   Beta-selinene cyclase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (beta-selinene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   beta- selinene + diphosphate    Initial cyclization gives (+)-germacrene A in an enzyme bound form.
