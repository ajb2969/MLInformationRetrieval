Q-exponential

In combinatorial mathematics, the q-exponential is a q-analog of the exponential function, namely the eigenfunction of the q-derivative
Definition
The q-exponential 
 
 
 
  is defined as



where 
 
 
 
  is the q-factorial and



is the q-Pochhammer symbol. That this is the q-analog of the exponential follows from the property



where the derivative on the left is the q-derivative. The above is easily verified by considering the q-derivative of the monomial



Here, 
 
 
 
  is the q-bracket.
Properties
For real 
 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  is an entire function of z. For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is regular in the disk 
 
 
 
 .
Note the inverse, 
 
 
 
 
 .
Relations
For 
 
 
 
 , a function that is closely related is



Here, 
 
 
 
  is a special case of the basic hypergeometric series:
