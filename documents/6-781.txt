   Complex differential form      Complex differential form   In mathematics , a complex differential form is a differential form on a manifold (usually a complex manifold ) which is permitted to have complex coefficients.  Complex forms have broad applications in differential geometry . On complex manifolds, they are fundamental and serve as the basis for much of algebraic geometry , Kähler geometry , and Hodge theory . Over non-complex manifolds, they also play a role in the study of almost complex structures , the theory of spinors , and CR structures .  Typically, complex forms are considered because of some desirable decomposition that the forms admit. On a complex manifold, for instance, any complex k -form can be decomposed uniquely into a sum of so-called ( p , q )-forms : roughly, wedges of p  differentials of the holomorphic coordinates with q differentials of their complex conjugates. The ensemble of ( p , q )-forms becomes the primitive object of study, and determines a finer geometrical structure on the manifold than the k -forms. Even finer structures exist, for example, in cases where Hodge theory applies.  Differential forms on a complex manifold  Suppose that M is a complex manifold . Then there is a local coordinate system consisting of n complex-valued functions z 1 ,...,z n such that the coordinate transitions from one patch to another are holomorphic functions of these variables. The space of complex forms carries a rich structure, depending fundamentally on the fact that these transition functions are holomorphic, rather than just smooth .  One-forms  We begin with the case of one-forms. First decompose the complex coordinates into their real and imaginary parts: z j = x j + iy j for each j . Letting         d   z  j    =    d   x  j    +   i  d   y  j      ,    d    z  ¯   j    =    d   x  j    -   i  d   y  j       ,     formulae-sequence      d   superscript  z  j        d   superscript  x  j      i  d   superscript  y  j          d   superscript   normal-¯  z   j        d   superscript  x  j      i  d   superscript  y  j        dz^{j}=dx^{j}+idy^{j},\quad d\bar{z}^{j}=dx^{j}-idy^{j},   one sees that any differential form with complex coefficients can be written uniquely as a sum         ∑   j  =  1   n     f  j   d   z  j     +    g  j   d    z  ¯   j     .        superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  f  j   d   superscript  z  j        subscript  g  j   d   superscript   normal-¯  z   j      \sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{j}dz^{j}+g_{j}d\bar{z}^{j}.     Let Ω 1,0 be the space of complex differential forms containing only    d  z      d  z    dz   's and Ω 0,1 be the space of forms containing only    d   z  ¯       d   normal-¯  z     d\bar{z}   's. One can show, by the Cauchy-Riemann equations , that the spaces Ω 1,0 and Ω 0,1 are stable under holomorphic coordinate changes. In other words, if one makes a different choice w i of holomorphic coordinate system, then elements of Ω 1,0 transform tensorially , as do elements of Ω 0,1 . Thus the spaces Ω 0,1 and Ω 1,0 determine complex vector bundles on the complex manifold.  Higher degree forms  The wedge product of complex differential forms is defined in the same way as with real forms. Let p and q be a pair of non-negative integers ≤ n . The space Ω p,q of ( p , q )-forms is defined by taking linear combinations of the wedge products of p elements from Ω 1,0 and q elements from Ω 0,1 . Symbolically,       Ω   p  ,  q    =    Ω   1  ,  0    ∧  ⋯  ∧   Ω   1  ,  0    ∧   Ω   0  ,  1    ∧  ⋯  ∧   Ω   0  ,  1          superscript  normal-Ω   p  q       superscript  normal-Ω   1  0    normal-⋯   superscript  normal-Ω   1  0     superscript  normal-Ω   0  1    normal-⋯   superscript  normal-Ω   0  1       \Omega^{p,q}=\Omega^{1,0}\wedge\cdots\wedge\Omega^{1,0}\wedge\Omega^{0,1}%
 \wedge\cdots\wedge\Omega^{0,1}   where there are p factors of Ω 1,0 and q factors of Ω 0,1 . Just as with the two spaces of 1-forms, these are stable under holomorphic changes of coordinates, and so determine vector bundles.  If E k is the space of all complex differential forms of total degree k , then each element of E k can be expressed in a unique way as a linear combination of elements from among the spaces Ω p,q with p + q = k . More succinctly, there is a direct sum decomposition        E  k   =    Ω   k  ,  0    ⊕   Ω    k  -  1   ,  1    ⊕  ⋯  ⊕   Ω   1  ,   k  -  1     ⊕   Ω   0  ,  k     =    ⊕    p  +  q   =  k     Ω   p  ,  q      .         superscript  E  k    direct-sum   superscript  normal-Ω   k  0     superscript  normal-Ω     k  1   1    normal-⋯   superscript  normal-Ω   1    k  1      superscript  normal-Ω   0  k            subscript  direct-sum      p  q   k     superscript  normal-Ω   p  q        E^{k}=\Omega^{k,0}\oplus\Omega^{k-1,1}\oplus\cdots\oplus\Omega^{1,k-1}\oplus%
 \Omega^{0,k}=\bigoplus_{p+q=k}\Omega^{p,q}.   Because this direct sum decomposition is stable under holomorphic coordinate changes, it also determines a vector bundle decomposition.  In particular, for each k and each p and q with p + q = k , there is a canonical projection of vector bundles        π   p  ,  q    :    E  k   →   Ω   p  ,  q      .     normal-:   superscript  π   p  q     normal-→   superscript  E  k    superscript  normal-Ω   p  q       \pi^{p,q}:E^{k}\rightarrow\Omega^{p,q}.     The Dolbeault operators  The usual exterior derivative defines a mapping of sections    d  :    E  r   →   E   p  +  q  +  1        normal-:  d   normal-→   superscript  E  r    superscript  E    p  q  1       d:E^{r}\to E^{p+q+1}   via       d   (   E   p  ,  q    )    =    ∑    r  +  s   =   p  +  q  +  1      E   r  ,  s           d   superscript  E   p  q       subscript       r  s     p  q  1      superscript  E   r  s       d(E^{p,q})=\sum_{r+s=p+q+1}E^{r,s}   The exterior derivative does not in itself reflect the more rigid complex structure of the manifold.  Using d and the projections defined in the previous subsection, it is possible to define the Dolbeault operators :       ∂  =    π    p  +  1   ,  q    ∘  d    :     Ω   p  ,  q    →   Ω    p  +  1   ,  q     ,    ∂  ¯   =    π   p  ,   q  +  1     ∘  d     :    Ω   p  ,  q    →   Ω   p  ,   q  +  1           normal-:        superscript  π     p  1   q    d     formulae-sequence   normal-→   superscript  normal-Ω   p  q     superscript  normal-Ω     p  1   q        normal-¯       superscript  π   p    q  1     d       normal-:     normal-→   superscript  normal-Ω   p  q     superscript  normal-Ω   p    q  1         \partial=\pi^{p+1,q}\circ d:\Omega^{p,q}\rightarrow\Omega^{p+1,q},\quad\bar{%
 \partial}=\pi^{p,q+1}\circ d:\Omega^{p,q}\rightarrow\Omega^{p,q+1}   To describe these operators in local coordinates, let      α  =      ∑     |  I  |   =  p   ,    |  J  |   =  q         f   I  J     d   z  I     ∧   d    z  ¯   J     ∈   Ω   p  ,  q          α      subscript    formulae-sequence      I   p       J   q        subscript  f    I  J    d   superscript  z  I       d   superscript   normal-¯  z   J           superscript  normal-Ω   p  q       \alpha=\sum_{|I|=p,|J|=q}\ f_{IJ}\,dz^{I}\wedge d\bar{z}^{J}\in\Omega^{p,q}   where I and J are multi-indices . Then       ∂  α   =     ∑    |  I  |   ,   |  J  |       ∑  ℓ       ∂   f   I  J      ∂   z  ℓ      d   z  ℓ      ∧   d   z  I    ∧   d    z  ¯   J           α       subscript      I     J       subscript   normal-ℓ          subscript  f    I  J        superscript  z  normal-ℓ     d   superscript  z  normal-ℓ        d   superscript  z  I      d   superscript   normal-¯  z   J       \partial\alpha=\sum_{|I|,|J|}\sum_{\ell}\frac{\partial f_{IJ}}{\partial z^{%
 \ell}}\,dz^{\ell}\wedge dz^{I}\wedge d\bar{z}^{J}            ∂  ¯   α   =     ∑    |  I  |   ,   |  J  |       ∑  ℓ      ∂   f   I  J      ∂    z  ¯   ℓ     d    z  ¯   ℓ      ∧   d   z  I    ∧   d    z  ¯   J      .         normal-¯    α       subscript      I     J       subscript   normal-ℓ          subscript  f    I  J        superscript   normal-¯  z   normal-ℓ     d   superscript   normal-¯  z   normal-ℓ        d   superscript  z  I      d   superscript   normal-¯  z   J       \bar{\partial}\alpha=\sum_{|I|,|J|}\sum_{\ell}\frac{\partial f_{IJ}}{\partial%
 \bar{z}^{\ell}}d\bar{z}^{\ell}\wedge dz^{I}\wedge d\bar{z}^{J}.     The following properties are seen to hold:      d  =   ∂  +   ∂  ¯        d      normal-¯       d=\partial+\bar{\partial}          ∂  2   =    ∂  ¯   2   =    ∂   ∂  ¯    +    ∂  ¯   ∂    =  0.         superscript   2    superscript   normal-¯    2             normal-¯        normal-¯            0.     \partial^{2}=\bar{\partial}^{2}=\partial\bar{\partial}+\bar{\partial}\partial=0.     These operators and their properties form the basis for Dolbeault cohomology and many aspects of Hodge theory .  Holomorphic forms  For each p , a holomorphic p -form is a holomorphic section of the bundle Ω p,0 . In local coordinates, then, a holomorphic p -form can be written in the form      α  =    ∑    |  I  |   =  p       f  I    d   z  I         α    subscript       I   p       subscript  f  I   d   superscript  z  I       \alpha=\sum_{|I|=p}f_{I}\,dz^{I}     where the f I are holomorphic functions. Equivalently, the ( p ,0)-form α is holomorphic if and only if        ∂  ¯   α   =  0.         normal-¯    α   0.    \bar{\partial}\alpha=0.   The sheaf of holomorphic p -forms is often written Ω p , although this can sometimes lead to confusion so many authors tend to adopt an alternative notation.
