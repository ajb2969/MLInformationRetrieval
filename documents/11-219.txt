L-fuconate dehydratase




L-fuconate dehydratase

In enzymology, a L-fuconate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-fuconate 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-fuconate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-fuconate, and two products, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-fuconate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-fuconate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-fuconate-forming). This enzyme is also called L-fuconate hydro-lyase.
