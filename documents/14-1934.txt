   Campbell's theorem (probability)      Campbell's theorem (probability)   In probability theory and statistics , Campell's theorem or the Campbell-Hardy theorem can refer to a particular equation or set of results relating to the expectation of a function summed over a point process to an integral involving the intensity measure of the point process, which allows for the calculation of expected value and variance of the random  sum . One version 1 of the theorem specifically relates to the Poisson point process and gives a method for calculating moments as well as Laplace functionals of the process.  Another result by the name of Campell's theorem, 2 but also known as Campbell's formula , 3 entails an integral equation for the aforementioned sum over a general point process, and not necessarily a Poisson point process. 4 There also exist equations involving moment measures and factorial moment measures that are considered versions of Campbell's formula. All these results are employed in probability and statistics with a particular importance in the related fields of point processes , 5  stochastic geometry 6 and continuum percolation theory , R. Meester and R. Roy. Continuum percolation, volume 119 of Cambridge tracts in mathematics, 1996.   spatial statistics . 7 8  The theorem's name stems from the work 9 10 by Norman R. Campbell on theormionic noise, also known as shot noise , in vacuum tubes , 11 12 which was partly inspired by the work of Ernest Rutherford and Hans Geiger on alpha particle detection, where the Poisson point process arose as a solution to a family of differential equations by Harry Bateman . 13 In Campbell's work, he presents the moments and generating functions of the random sum of a Poisson process on the real line, but remarks that the main mathematical argument was due to G. H. Hardy , which has inspired the result to be sometimes called the Campbell-Hardy theorem . 14 15  Background  For a point process   N   N   {N}   defined on ( d -dimensional) Euclidean space     ùêë  d     superscript  R  d    \textbf{R}^{d}   , Campbell's theorem offers a way to calculate expectations of a function   f   f   f   (with range in the real line R ) defined also on    ùêë  d     superscript  R  d    \textbf{R}^{d}   and summed over   N   N   {N}   , namely:      E   [    ‚àë   x  ‚àà  N     f   (  x  )     ]       E   delimited-[]    subscript     x  N      f  x       E[\sum_{x\in{N}}f(x)]   ,  where   E   E   E   denotes the expectation and set notation is used such that   N   N   {N}   is considered as a random set (see Point process notation ). For a point process   N   N   {N}   , Campbell's theorem relates the above expectation with the intensity measure Œõ . In relation to a Borel set  B the intensity measure of   N   N   {N}   is defined as:       Œõ   (  B  )    =   E   [   N   (  B  )    ]          normal-Œõ  B     E   delimited-[]    N  B       \Lambda(B)=E[{N}(B)]   ,  where the measure notation is used such that   N   N   {N}   is considered a random counting measure . The quantity Œõ(B) can be interpreted as the average number of points of   N   N   {N}   located in the set B .  Campbell's theorem: Poisson point process  One version of Campbell's theorem 16 says that for a Poisson point process   N   N   {N}   and a measurable function    f  :    ùêë  d   ‚Üí  ùêë      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí   superscript  R  d   R     f:\textbf{R}^{d}\rightarrow\textbf{R}   , the random sum      S  =    ‚àë   x  ‚àà  N     f   (  x  )         S    subscript     x  N      f  x      S=\sum_{x\in{N}}f(x)     is absolutely convergent with probability one  if and only if the integral         ‚à´   ùêë  d      min   (   |   f   (  x  )    |   ,  1  )    Œõ   (   d  x   )     <  ‚àû   .        subscript    superscript  R  d            f  x    1   normal-Œõ    d  x        \int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}\min(|f(x)|,1)\Lambda(dx)<\infty.     Provided that this integral is finite, then the theorem further asserts that for any complex value   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   the equation        E   (   e   Œ∏  S    )    =   exp   (    ‚à´   ùêë  d      [    e   Œ∏  f   (  x  )     -  1   ]   Œõ   (   d  x   )     )     ,        E   superscript  e    Œ∏  S       exp    subscript    superscript  R  d       delimited-[]     superscript  e    Œ∏  f  x    1    normal-Œõ    d  x        E(e^{\theta S})=\textrm{exp}\left(\int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}[e^{\theta f(x)}-1]%
 \Lambda(dx)\right),     holds if the integral on the right-hand side converges , which is the case for purely imaginary    Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   . Moreover        E   (  S  )    =    ‚à´   ùêë  d     f   (  x  )   Œõ   (   d  x   )      ,        E  S     subscript    superscript  R  d      f  x  normal-Œõ    d  x       E(S)=\int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}f(x)\Lambda(dx),     and if this integral converges, then        Var   (  S  )    =    ‚à´   ùêë  d     f    (  x  )   2   Œõ   (   d  x   )      ,        Var  S     subscript    superscript  R  d      f   superscript  x  2   normal-Œõ    d  x       \text{Var}(S)=\int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}f(x)^{2}\Lambda(dx),     where    Var   (  S  )       Var  S    \text{Var}(S)   denotes the variance of the random sum   S   S   S   .  From this theorem some expectation results for the Poisson point process follow directly including its Laplace functional. 17   Campbell's theorem: general point process  A related result for a general (not necessarily simple) point process   N   N   {N}   with intensity measure:        Œõ   (  B  )    =   E   [   N   (  B  )    ]     ,        normal-Œõ  B     E   delimited-[]    N  B       \Lambda(B)=E[{N}(B)],     is known as Campbell's formula 18 or Campbell's theorem , 19 20 which gives a method for calculating expectations of sums of measurable functions    f   f   f   with ranges on the real line . More specifically, for a point process   N   N   {N}   and a measurable function    f  :    ùêë  d   ‚Üí  ùêë      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí   superscript  R  d   R     f:\textbf{R}^{d}\rightarrow\textbf{R}   , the sum of   f   f   f   over the point process is given by the equation:        E   [    ‚àë   x  ‚àà  N     f   (  x  )     ]    =    ‚à´   ùêë  d     f   (  x  )   Œõ   (   d  x   )      ,        E   delimited-[]    subscript     x  N      f  x        subscript    superscript  R  d      f  x  normal-Œõ    d  x       E\left[\sum_{x\in{N}}f(x)\right]=\int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}f(x)\Lambda(dx),     where if one side of the equation is finite, then so is the other side.

This equation is essentially an application of Fubini's theorem 21 and coincides with the aforementioned Poisson case, but holds for a much wider class of point processes, simple or not. 22 Depending on the integral notation, this integral may also be written as: 23        E   [    ‚àë   x  ‚àà  N     f   (  x  )     ]    =    ‚à´   ùêë  d     f  d  Œõ     ,        E   delimited-[]    subscript     x  N      f  x        subscript    superscript  R  d      f  d  normal-Œõ      E\left[\sum_{x\in{N}}f(x)\right]=\int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}fd\Lambda,     If the intensity measure   Œõ   normal-Œõ   \Lambda   of a point process   N   N   {N}   has a density    Œª   (  x  )       Œª  x    \lambda(x)   , then Campbell's formula becomes:       E   [    ‚àë   x  ‚àà  N     f   (  x  )     ]    =    ‚à´   ùêë  d     f   (  x  )   Œª   (  x  )   d  x          E   delimited-[]    subscript     x  N      f  x        subscript    superscript  R  d      f  x  Œª  x  d  x      E\left[\sum_{x\in{N}}f(x)\right]=\int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}f(x)\lambda(x)dx     Stationary point process  For a stationary point process   N   N   {N}   with constant density    Œª  >  0      Œª  0    \lambda>0   , Campbell's theorem or formula reduces to a volume integral:       E   [    ‚àë   x  ‚àà  N     f   (  x  )     ]    =   Œª    ‚à´   ùêë  d     f   (  x  )   d  x           E   delimited-[]    subscript     x  N      f  x        Œª    subscript    superscript  R  d      f  x  d  x       E\left[\sum_{x\in{N}}f(x)\right]=\lambda\int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}f(x)dx     This equation naturally holds for the homogeneous Poisson point processes, which is an example of a stationary stochastic process . 24  Applications  Laplace functional of the Poisson point process  For a Poisson point process   N   N   {N}   with intensity measure   Œõ   normal-Œõ   \Lambda   , the Laplace functional is a consequence of Campbell's theorem 25 and is given by: 26         ‚Ñí  N    (  s  )    :=   E   [   e   s     ‚àë   x  ‚àà  N      f   (  x  )       ]    =   exp   [   -    ‚à´   ùêë  d      (   1  -   e   -   s  f   (  x  )       )   Œõ   (   d  x   )      ]     ,       assign     subscript  ‚Ñí  N   s     E   delimited-[]   superscript  e    s    subscript     x  N      f  x                   subscript    superscript  R  d        1   superscript  e      s  f  x      normal-Œõ    d  x          \mathcal{L}_{{N}}(s):=E\bigl[e^{s\sum_{x\in N}f(x)}\bigr]=\exp\Bigl[-\int_{%
 \textbf{R}^{d}}(1-e^{-sf(x)})\Lambda(dx)\Bigr],     which for the homogeneous case is:         ‚Ñí  N    (  s  )    =   exp   [   -   Œª    ‚à´   ùêë  d      (   1  -   e   -   s  f   (  x  )       )   d  x      ]     .         subscript  ‚Ñí  N   s         Œª    subscript    superscript  R  d        1   superscript  e      s  f  x      d  x         \mathcal{L}_{{N}}(s)=\exp\Bigl[-\lambda\int_{\textbf{R}^{d}}(1-e^{-sf(x)})dx%

When an Poisson approximation is used the mean current and variance are given by Campbell theorem. As the synaptic timecourse is typically known, this can be applied to infer the input rate.  Extension to higher moments is given in. 27  Another common extension is to consider a sum with random amplitudes      S  =    ‚àë   x  ‚àà  N      a  n   f   (  x  )         S    subscript     x  N       subscript  a  n   f  x      S=\sum_{x\in{N}}a_{n}f(x)   In this case the cumulants    Œ∫  i     subscript  Œ∫  i    \kappa_{i}   of   S   S   S   equal       Œ∫  i   =   Œª    a  i   ¬Ø    ‚à´   f   (  x  )   d  x          subscript  Œ∫  i     Œª   normal-¬Ø   superscript  a  i        f  x  d  x       \kappa_{i}=\lambda\overline{a^{i}}\int f(x)dx   where     a  i   ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø   superscript  a  i     \overline{a^{i}}   are the raw moments of the distribution of   a   a   a   .
