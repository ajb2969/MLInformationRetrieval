2-methylcitrate dehydratase

In enzymology, a 2-methylcitrate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(2S,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate 
 
 
 
  (Z)-but-2-ene-1,2,3-tricarboxylate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (2S,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate, and two products, (Z)-but-2-ene-1,2,3-tricarboxylate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2S,3S)-2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate hydro-lyase [(Z)-but-2-ene-1,2,3-tricarboxylate-forming]. Other names in common use include 2-methylcitrate hydro-lyase, PrpD, and 2-hydroxybutane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in propanoate metabolism.
