For Liouville's equation in quantum mechanics, see Von Neumann equation .    In differential geometry , Liouville's equation , named after Joseph Liouville , is the nonlinear partial differential equation satisfied by the conformal factor   f   f   f   of a metric     f  2    (    d   x  2    +   d   y  2     )        superscript  f  2       normal-d   superscript  x  2      normal-d   superscript  y  2       f^{2}(\mathrm{d}x^{2}+\mathrm{d}y^{2})   on a surface of constant Gaussian curvature    K   K   K   :         Δ  0    log  f    =   -   K   f  2      ,         subscript  normal-Δ  0     f        K   superscript  f  2       \Delta_{0}\log f=-Kf^{2},     where    Δ  0     subscript  normal-Δ  0    \Delta_{0}   is the flat Laplace operator .       Δ  0   =     ∂  2    ∂   x  2     +    ∂  2    ∂   y  2      =   4   ∂   ∂  z     ∂   ∂   z  ¯             subscript  normal-Δ  0        superscript   2      superscript  x  2        superscript   2      superscript  y  2             4       z          normal-¯  z         \Delta_{0}=\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial y^%
 {2}}=4\frac{\partial}{\partial z}\frac{\partial}{\partial\bar{z}}     Liouville's equation appears in the study of isothermal coordinates in differential geometry: the independent variables     x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   are the coordinates, while   f   f   f   can be described as the conformal factor with respect to the flat metric. Occasionally it is the square    f  2     superscript  f  2    f^{2}   that is referred to as the conformal factor, instead of   f   f   f   itself.  Liouville's equation was also taken as an example by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem . 1  Other common forms of Liouville's equation  By using the change of variables "      log   f   =  u        f   u    \log\,f=u   ", another commonly found form of Liouville's equation is obtained:         Δ  0   u   =   -   K   e   2  u       .         subscript  normal-Δ  0   u       K   superscript  e    2  u        \Delta_{0}u=-Ke^{2u}.     Other two forms of the equation, commonly found in the literature, 2 are obtained by using the slight variant "     2    log   f    =  u        2    f    u    2\log\,f=u   " of the previous change of variables and Wirtinger calculus : 3          Δ  0   u   =    -   2  K   e  u     ⟺        ∂  2   u     ∂  z    ∂   z  ¯      =   -    K  2    e  u       .     formulae-sequence       subscript  normal-Δ  0   u        2  K   superscript  e  u     normal-⟺          superscript   2   u       z      normal-¯  z            K  2    superscript  e  u        \Delta_{0}u=-2Ke^{u}\quad\Longleftrightarrow\quad\frac{\partial^{2}u}{{%
 \partial z}{\partial\bar{z}}}=-\frac{K}{2}e^{u}.     Note that it is exactly in the first one of the preceding two forms that Liouville's equation was cited by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem . 4 Hilbert assumes , therefore the equation appears as the following semilinear  elliptic equation :          ∂  2   f    ∂   x  2     +     ∂  2   f    ∂   y  2      =   e  f             superscript   2   f      superscript  x  2         superscript   2   f      superscript  y  2       superscript  e  f     \frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x^{2}}+\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial y^{2}}=e^{f}     A formulation using the Laplace-Beltrami operator  In a more invariant fashion, the equation can be written in terms of the intrinsic  Laplace-Beltrami operator       Δ  LB   =    1   f  2     Δ  0         subscript  normal-Δ  LB       1   superscript  f  2     subscript  normal-Δ  0      \Delta_{\mathrm{LB}}=\frac{1}{f^{2}}\Delta_{0}     as follows:         Δ  LB     log   f    =   -  K    .         subscript  normal-Δ  LB     f      K     \Delta_{\mathrm{LB}}\log\;f=-K.     Properties  Relation to Gauss–Codazzi equations  Liouville's equation is a consequence of the Gauss–Codazzi equations when the metric is written in isothermal coordinates .  General solution of the equation  In a simply connected  domain    Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   , the general solution of Liouville's equation can be found by using Wirtinger calculus. 5 Its form is given by       u   (  z  ,   z  ¯   )    =    1  2    ln   (   4     |     d  f   (  z  )    /  d   z   |   2     (   1  +   K    |   f   (  z  )    |   2     )   2     )           u   z   normal-¯  z         1  2       4     superscript          normal-d  f  z   normal-d   z    2    superscript    1    K   superscript      f  z    2     2         u(z,\bar{z})=\frac{1}{2}\ln\left(4\frac{\left|{\mathrm{d}f(z)}/{\mathrm{d}z}%
 \right|^{2}}{(1+K\left|f(z)\right|^{2})^{2}}\right)     where    f   (  z  )       f  z    f(z)   is any meromorphic function such that          d  f   (  z  )    /  d   z   ≠  0            normal-d  f  z   normal-d   z   0    {\mathrm{d}f(z)}/{\mathrm{d}z}\neq 0   for every    z  ∈  Ω      z  normal-Ω    z\in\Omega   . 6      f   (  z  )       f  z    f(z)   has at most simple poles in   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   . 7   Application  Liouville's equation can be used to prove the following classification results for surfaces:  1|Theorem . 8 A surface in the Euclidean 3-space with metric     d   l  2    =   g   (  z  ,   z  ¯   )   d  z  d   z  ¯          normal-d   superscript  l  2      g   z   normal-¯  z    normal-d  z  normal-d   normal-¯  z      \mathrm{d}l^{2}=g(z,{\bar{z}}){\mathrm{d}z}{\mathrm{d}\bar{z}}   , and with constant scalar curvature   K   K   K   is locally isometric to:   the sphere if    K  >  0      K  0    K>0   ;  the Euclidean plane if ;  the Lobachevskian plane if    K  .  5
