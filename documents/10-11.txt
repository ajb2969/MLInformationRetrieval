In differential geometry, Liouville's equation, named after Joseph Liouville, is the nonlinear partial differential equation satisfied by the conformal factor 
 
 
 
  of a metric 
 
 
 
  on a surface of constant Gaussian curvature

 
 :



where 
 
 
 
  is the flat Laplace operator.



Liouville's equation appears in the study of isothermal coordinates in differential geometry: the independent variables

 
  are the coordinates, while 
 
 
 
  can be described as the conformal factor with respect to the flat metric. Occasionally it is the square 
 
 
 
  that is referred to as the conformal factor, instead of 
 
 
 
  itself.
Liouville's equation was also taken as an example by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem.1
Other common forms of Liouville's equation
By using the change of variables "
 
 
 
 ", another commonly found form of Liouville's equation is obtained:



Other two forms of the equation, commonly found in the literature,2 are obtained by using the slight variant "
 
 
 
 " of the previous change of variables and Wirtinger calculus:3



Note that it is exactly in the first one of the preceding two forms that Liouville's equation was cited by David Hilbert in the formulation of his nineteenth problem.4Hilbert assumes , therefore the equation appears as the following semilinear elliptic equation:



A formulation using the Laplace-Beltrami operator
In a more invariant fashion, the equation can be written in terms of the intrinsic Laplace-Beltrami operator



as follows:



Properties
Relation to Gauss–Codazzi equations
Liouville's equation is a consequence of the Gauss–Codazzi equations when the metric is written in isothermal coordinates.
General solution of the equation
In a simply connected domain

 
 , the general solution of Liouville's equation can be found by using Wirtinger calculus.5 Its form is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is any meromorphic function such that



 
  for every

  has at most simple poles in 
 
 
 
 .7

Application
Liouville's equation can be used to prove the following classification results for surfaces:
1|Theorem.8 A surface in the Euclidean 3-space with metric 
 
 
 
 , and with constant scalar curvature 
 
 
 
  is locally isometric to:

the sphere if 
 
 
 
 ;
the Euclidean plane if ;
the Lobachevskian plane if
