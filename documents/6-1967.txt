   Reversible dynamics      Reversible dynamics   Mathematics  In mathematics , a dynamical system is invertible if the forward evolution is one-to-one, not many-to-one; so that for every state there exists a well-defined reverse-time evolution operator.  The dynamics are time-reversible if there exists a transformation (an involution ) π which gives a one-to-one mapping between the time-reversed evolution of any one state, and the forward-time evolution of another corresponding state, given by the operator equation:       U   -  t    =    π     U  t    π        subscript  U    t      π   subscript  U  t   π     U_{-t}=\pi\,U_{t}\,\pi     Any time-independent structures (for example critical points , or attractors ) which the dynamics gives rise to must therefore either be self-symmetrical or have symmetrical images under the involution π.  Physics  In physics , the laws of motion of classical mechanics have the above property, if the operator π reverses the conjugate momenta of all the particles of the system, '' p -> -p ''. ( T-symmetry ).  In quantum mechanical systems, it turns out that the weak nuclear force is not invariant under T-symmetry alone. If weak interactions are present, reversible dynamics are still possible, but only if the operator π also reverses the signs of all the charges , and the parity of the spatial co-ordinates ( C-symmetry and P-symmetry ).  Thermodynamic systems might be reversible or irreversible.  Stochastic processes  A stochastic  process is reversible if the statistical properties of the process are the same as the statistical properties for time-reversed data from the same process. More formally, for all sets of time increments { τ s } , where s = 1..k for any k, the joint probabilities      p   (   x  t   ,   x   t  +   τ  1     ,   x   t  +   τ  2     .  .   x   t  +   τ  k     )   =  p   (   x   t  ′    ,   x    t  ′   -   τ  1     ,   x    t  ′   -   τ  2     .  .   x    t  ′   -   τ  k     )      fragments  p   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  t   normal-,   subscript  x    t   subscript  τ  1     normal-,   subscript  x    t   subscript  τ  2     normal-.  normal-.   subscript  x    t   subscript  τ  k     normal-)    p   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x   superscript  t  normal-′    normal-,   subscript  x     superscript  t  normal-′    subscript  τ  1     normal-,   subscript  x     superscript  t  normal-′    subscript  τ  2     normal-.  normal-.   subscript  x     superscript  t  normal-′    subscript  τ  k     normal-)     p(x_{t},x_{t+\tau_{1}},x_{t+\tau_{2}}..x_{t+\tau_{k}})=p(x_{t^{\prime}},x_{t^{%
 \prime}-\tau_{1}},x_{t^{\prime}-\tau_{2}}..x_{t^{\prime}-\tau_{k}})     A simple consequence for Markov processes is that they can only be reversible if their stationary distributions have the property      p   (   x  t   =  i  ,   x   t  +  1    =  j  )   =  p   (   x  t   =  j  ,   x   t  +  1    =  i  )      fragments  p   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  t    i  normal-,   subscript  x    t  1     j  normal-)    p   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  t    j  normal-,   subscript  x    t  1     i  normal-)     p(x_{t}=i,x_{t+1}=j)=\,p(x_{t}=j,x_{t+1}=i)   This is called the property of detailed balance .
