Reversible dynamics

Mathematics
In mathematics, a dynamical system is invertible if the forward evolution is one-to-one, not many-to-one; so that for every state there exists a well-defined reverse-time evolution operator.
The dynamics are time-reversible if there exists a transformation (an involution) π which gives a one-to-one mapping between the time-reversed evolution of any one state, and the forward-time evolution of another corresponding state, given by the operator equation:



Any time-independent structures (for example critical points, or attractors) which the dynamics gives rise to must therefore either be self-symmetrical or have symmetrical images under the involution π.
Physics
In physics, the laws of motion of classical mechanics have the above property, if the operator π reverses the conjugate momenta of all the particles of the system, '' p -> -p ''. (T-symmetry).
In quantum mechanical systems, it turns out that the weak nuclear force is not invariant under T-symmetry alone. If weak interactions are present, reversible dynamics are still possible, but only if the operator π also reverses the signs of all the charges, and the parity of the spatial co-ordinates (C-symmetry and P-symmetry).
Thermodynamic systems might be reversible or irreversible.
Stochastic processes
A stochastic process is reversible if the statistical properties of the process are the same as the statistical properties for time-reversed data from the same process. More formally, for all sets of time increments { τs }, where s = 1..k for any k, the joint probabilities



A simple consequence for Markov processes is that they can only be reversible if their stationary distributions have the property


 
  This is called the property of detailed balance.
