   6-hydroxynicotinate reductase      6-hydroxynicotinate reductase   In enzymology , a 6-hydroxynicotinate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-oxo-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinate + oxidized ferredoxin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-hydroxynicotinate + reduced ferredoxin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-oxo-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinate and oxidized ferredoxin , whereas its two products are 6-hydroxynicotinate and reduced ferredoxin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-oxo-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 6-oxotetrahydronicotinate dehydrogenase , 6-hydroxynicotinic reductase , HNA reductase , and 1,4,5,6-tetrahydro-6-oxonicotinate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase .
