Cooling capacity

Cooling capacity is the measure of a cooling system's ability to remove heat.1 The SI units are watts (W). Other common units include tons, and tonnes, which describe the amount of water at a given temperature that can be frozen in a given amount of time.2 1 ton of refrigeration is the ability of a refrigerator to freeze 2000 lbm of water at 0 °C or 32 °F in the period of 24 hours. 1 ton of refrigeration is equivalent to 211 [kJ/min] or 200 [Btu/min].3
The basic SI units equation for deriving cooling capacity is of the form:


 
  Where


 
  is the cooling capacity [kW]


 
  is the mass rate [kg/s]


 
  is the specific heat capacity [kJ/kg K]


 
  is the temperature change [K]
