   Amygdalin beta-glucosidase      Amygdalin beta-glucosidase   In enzymology , an amygdalin beta-glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ( R ) - amygdalin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ( R )-prunasin + D -glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ( R )- amygdalin and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ( R )- prunasin and D - glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O - and S -glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is amygdalin beta- D -glucohydrolase . Other names in common use include amygdalase , amygdalinase , amygdalin hydrolase , and amygdalin glucosidase .
