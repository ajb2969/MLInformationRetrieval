Compacton

In the theory of integrable systems, a compacton, introduced in , is a soliton with compact support.
An example of an equation with compacton solutions is the generalization



of the Korteweg–de Vries equation (KdV equation) with m, n > 1. The case with m = n is the Rosenau–Hyman equation as used in their 1993 study; the case m = 2, n = 1 is essentially the KdV equation.
Example
The equation



has a travelling wave solution given by



This has compact support in x, so is a compacton.
