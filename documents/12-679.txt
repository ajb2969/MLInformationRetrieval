   Compacton      Compacton   In the theory of integrable systems , a compacton , introduced in , is a soliton with compact support .  An example of an equation with compacton solutions is the generalization        u  t   +    (   u  m   )   x   +    (   u  n   )    x  x  x     =   0          subscript  u  t    subscript   superscript  u  m   x    subscript   superscript  u  n     x  x  x     0    u_{t}+(u^{m})_{x}+(u^{n})_{xxx}=0\,     of the Korteweg–de Vries equation (KdV equation) with m , n > 1. The case with m = n is the Rosenau–Hyman equation as used in their 1993 study; the case m = 2, n = 1 is essentially the KdV equation.  Example  The equation        u  t   +    (   u  2   )   x   +    (   u  2   )    x  x  x     =   0          subscript  u  t    subscript   superscript  u  2   x    subscript   superscript  u  2     x  x  x     0    u_{t}+(u^{2})_{x}+(u^{2})_{xxx}=0\,     has a travelling wave solution given by       u   (  x  ,  t  )    =   {        4  λ   3     cos  2    (    (   x  -   λ  t    )   /  4   )          if   |   x  -   λ  t    |    ≤   2  π    ,             0       if   |   x  -   λ  t    |    ≥   2  π    .             u   x  t     cases        4  λ   3     superscript   2       x    λ  t    4         if      x    λ  t        2  π    absent  otherwise  0      if      x    λ  t        2  π       u(x,t)=\begin{cases}\dfrac{4\lambda}{3}\cos^{2}((x-\lambda t)/4)&\text{if }|x-%
 \lambda t|\leq 2\pi,\\
 \\
 0&\text{if }|x-\lambda t|\geq 2\pi.\end{cases}     This has compact support in x , so is a compacton.  See also   peakon  vector soliton   References      "  Category:Solitons
