   Lindley equation      Lindley equation   In probability theory , the Lindley equation , Lindley recursion or Lindley processes 1 is a discrete-time stochastic process  A n where n takes integer values and    A n + 1 = max(0, A n + B n ).     Processes of this form can be used to describe the waiting time of customers in a queue or evolution of a queue length over time. The idea was first proposed in the discussion following Kendall 's 1951 paper. 2 3  Waiting times  In Dennis Lindley 's first paper on the subject 4 the equation is used to describe waiting times experienced by customers in a queue with the First-In First-Out (FIFO) discipline.    W n + 1 = max(0, W n + U n )     where   T n is the time between the n th and ( n +1)th arrivals,  S n is the service time of the n th customer, and  U n = S n − T n  W n is the waiting time of the n th customer.   The first customer does not need to wait so W 1 = 0. Subsequent customers will have to wait if they arrive at a time before the previous customer has been served.  Queue lengths  The evolution of the queue length process can also be written in the form of a Lindley equation.  Integral equation  Lindley's integral equation is a relationship satisfied by the stationary waiting time distribution F( x ) in a G/G/1 queue .          F   (  x  )    =    ∫   0  -   ∞    K   (   x  -  y   )   F   (   d  y   )       x  ≥  0      formulae-sequence      F  x     superscript   subscript    superscript  0         K    x  y   F    d  y        x  0     F(x)=\int_{0^{-}}^{\infty}K(x-y)F(\text{d}y)\quad x\geq 0        where K( x ) is the distribution function of the random variable denoting the difference between the ( k - 1)th customer's arrival and the inter-arrival time between ( k - 1)th and k th customers. The Wiener–Hopf method can be used to solve this expression. 5  Notes  "  Category:Queueing theory     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
