If X is a zeta-distributed random variable with parameter s , then the probability that X takes the integer value k is given by the probability mass function        f  s    (  k  )    =     k   -  s    /  ζ    (  s  )           subscript  f  s   k        superscript  k    s    ζ   s     f_{s}(k)=k^{-s}/\zeta(s)\,     where ζ( s ) is the Riemann zeta function (which is undefined for s = 1).  The multiplicities of distinct prime factors of X are independent  random variables .  The Riemann zeta function being the sum of all terms    k   -  s      superscript  k    s     k^{-s}   for positive integer k , it appears thus as the normalization of the Zipf distribution . Indeed the terms "Zipf distribution" and the "zeta distribution" are often used interchangeably. But note that while the Zeta distribution is a probability distribution by itself, it is not associated to the Zipf's law with same exponent. See also Yule–Simon distribution  Moments  The n th raw moment is defined as the expected value of X n :       m  n   =   E   (   X  n   )    =    1   ζ   (  s  )       ∑   k  =  1   ∞    1   k   s  -  n              subscript  m  n     E   superscript  X  n             1    ζ  s      superscript   subscript     k  1        1   superscript  k    s  n          m_{n}=E(X^{n})=\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{k^{s-n}}     The series on the right is just a series representation of the Riemann zeta function, but it only converges for values of s-n that are greater than unity. Thus:       m  n   =   {        ζ   (   s  -  n   )    /  ζ    (  s  )         for   n   <   s  -  1        ∞       for   n   ≥   s  -  1           fragments   subscript  m  n     fragments  normal-{          ζ    s  n    ζ   s       for  n     s  1           for  n     s  1         m_{n}=\left\{\begin{matrix}\zeta(s-n)/\zeta(s)&\textrm{for}~{}n     Note that the ratio of the zeta functions is well defined, even for n ≥ s − 1 because the series representation of the zeta function can be analytically continued . This does not change the fact that the moments are specified by the series itself, and are therefore undefined for large n .  Moment generating function  The moment generating function is defined as        M   (  t  ;  s  )    =   E   (   e   t  X    )    =    1   ζ   (  s  )       ∑   k  =  1   ∞     e   t  k     k  s       .          M   t  s      E   superscript  e    t  X              1    ζ  s      superscript   subscript     k  1         superscript  e    t  k     superscript  k  s         M(t;s)=E(e^{tX})=\frac{1}{\zeta(s)}\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{tk}}{k^{s}}.     The series is just the definition of the polylogarithm , valid for     e  t   <  1       superscript  e  t   1    e^{t}<1   so that       M   (  t  ;  s  )    =      Li  s    (   e  t   )     ζ   (  s  )     for  t   <  0.          M   t  s          subscript  Li  s    superscript  e  t      ζ  s    for  t        0.     M(t;s)=\frac{\operatorname{Li}_{s}(e^{t})}{\zeta(s)}\text{ for }t<0.     The Taylor series expansion of this function will not necessarily yield the moments of the distribution. The Taylor series using the moments as they usually occur in the moment generating function yields        ∑   n  =  0   ∞      m  n    t  n     n  !     ,      superscript   subscript     n  0           subscript  m  n    superscript  t  n      n      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{m_{n}t^{n}}{n!},     which obviously is not well defined for any finite value of s since the moments become infinite for large n . If we use the analytically continued terms instead of the moments themselves, we obtain from a series representation of the polylogarithm        1   ζ   (  s  )       ∑    n  =  0   ,   n  ≠   s  -  1     ∞       ζ   (   s  -  n   )     n  !      t  n      =      Li  s    (   e  t   )    -   Φ   (  s  ,  t  )      ζ   (  s  )             1    ζ  s      superscript   subscript    formulae-sequence    n  0     n    s  1              ζ    s  n      n     superscript  t  n            subscript  Li  s    superscript  e  t      normal-Φ   s  t       ζ  s      \frac{1}{\zeta(s)}\sum_{n=0,n\neq s-1}^{\infty}\frac{\zeta(s-n)}{n!}\,t^{n}=%

However, if A is any set of positive integers that has a density, i.e. if       lim   n  →  ∞      N   (  A  ,  n  )    n       subscript    normal-→  n         N   A  n    n     \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{N(A,n)}{n}     exists where N ( A , n ) is the number of members of A less than or equal to n , then       lim   s  →   1  +     P   (  X  ∈  A  )      fragments   subscript    normal-→  s   limit-from  1      P   fragments  normal-(  X   A  normal-)     \lim_{s\rightarrow 1+}P(X\in A)\,     is equal to that density.  The latter limit can also exist in some cases in which A does not have a density. For example, if A is the set of all positive integers whose first digit is d , then A has no density, but nonetheless the second limit given above exists and is proportional to        log   (   d  +  1   )    -   log   (  d  )     ,          d  1      d     \log(d+1)-\log(d),\,     similar to Benford's law .
