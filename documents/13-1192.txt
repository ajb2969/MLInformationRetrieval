   Oscillatory integral operator      Oscillatory integral operator   In mathematics , in the field of harmonic analysis , an oscillatory integral operator is an integral operator of the form          T  λ   u   (  x  )    =    ∫   𝐑  n      e   i  λ  S   (  x  ,  y  )     a   (  x  ,  y  )   u   (  y  )   d  y     ,    x  ∈   𝐑  m    ,   y  ∈   𝐑  n      ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  T  λ   u  x     subscript    superscript  𝐑  n       superscript  e    i  λ  S   x  y     a   x  y   u  y  d  y      formulae-sequence    x   superscript  𝐑  m      y   superscript  𝐑  n       T_{\lambda}u(x)=\int_{\mathbf{R}^{n}}e^{i\lambda S(x,y)}a(x,y)u(y)\,dy,\qquad x%
 \in\mathbf{R}^{m},\quad y\in\mathbf{R}^{n},     where the function S(x,y) is called the phase of the operator and the function a(x,y) is called the symbol of the operator. λ is a parameter. One often considers S(x,y) to be real-valued and smooth, and a(x,y) smooth and compactly supported . Usually one is interested in the behavior of T λ for large values of λ.  Oscillatory integral operators often appear in many fields of mathematics ( analysis , partial differential equations , integral geometry , number theory ) and in physics. Properties of oscillatory integral operators have been studied by E. Stein 1 and his school.  Hörmander's theorem  The following bound on the L 2 → L 2 action of oscillatory integral operators (or L 2 → L 2  operator norm ) was obtained by Lars Hörmander in his paper on Fourier integral operators : 2  Assume that x,y ∈ R n , n ≥ 1. Let S(x,y) be real-valued and smooth, and let a(x,y) be smooth and compactly supported . If      det   j  ,  k        ∂  2   S     ∂   x  j     ∂   y  k       (  x  ,  y  )     ≠  0        subscript  det   j  k          superscript   2   S        subscript  x  j       subscript  y  k       x  y     0    \mathop{\rm det}_{j,k}\frac{\partial^{2}S}{\partial x_{j}\partial y_{k}}(x,y)\neq
 0   everywhere on the support of a(x,y) , then there is a constant C such that T λ , which is initially defined on smooth functions , extends to a continuous operator from L 2 ( R n ) to L 2 ( R n ), with the norm bounded by    C    λ   -   n  /  2          C   superscript  λ      n  2       C\lambda^{-n/2}\,   , for any λ ≥ 1:         ||   T  λ   ||      L  2    (   𝐑  n   )    →    L  2    (   𝐑  n   )      ≤   C   λ   -   n  /  2       .       subscript   norm   subscript  T  λ     normal-→     superscript  L  2    superscript  𝐑  n       superscript  L  2    superscript  𝐑  n        C   superscript  λ      n  2        ||T_{\lambda}||_{L^{2}(\mathbf{R}^{n})\to L^{2}(\mathbf{R}^{n})}\leq C\lambda^%
