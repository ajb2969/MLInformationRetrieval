   Void ratio      Void ratio   Void ratio , in materials science , is related to porosity and defined as the ratio :      e  =    V  V    V  S    =    V  V     V  T   -   V  V     =   ϕ   1  -  ϕ          e     subscript  V  V    subscript  V  S            subscript  V  V      subscript  V  T    subscript  V  V            ϕ    1  ϕ       e=\frac{V_{V}}{V_{S}}=\frac{V_{V}}{V_{T}-V_{V}}=\frac{\phi}{1-\phi}     and      ϕ  =    V  V    V  T    =    V  V     V  S   +   V  V     =   e   1  +  e          ϕ     subscript  V  V    subscript  V  T            subscript  V  V      subscript  V  S    subscript  V  V            e    1  e       \phi=\frac{V_{V}}{V_{T}}=\frac{V_{V}}{V_{S}+V_{V}}=\frac{e}{1+e}     where   e   e   e   is void ratio,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is porosity , V V is the volume of void-space (such as fluids), V S is the volume of solids, and V T is the total or bulk volume. This figure is relevant in composites , in mining (particular with regard to the properties of tailings ), and in soil science . In geotechnical engineering , it is considered as one of the state variables of soils and represented by the symbol e . 1 2  Note that in geotechnical engineering , the symbol   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   usually represents the angle of shearing resistance, a shear strength (soil) parameter.  Because of this, the equation is usually written:      e  =    V  V    V  S    =    V  V     V  T   -   V  V     =   n   1  -  n          e     subscript  V  V    subscript  V  S            subscript  V  V      subscript  V  T    subscript  V  V            n    1  n       e=\frac{V_{V}}{V_{S}}=\frac{V_{V}}{V_{T}-V_{V}}=\frac{n}{1-n}     and      n  =    V  V    V  T    =    V  V     V  S   +   V  V     =   e   1  +  e          n     subscript  V  V    subscript  V  T            subscript  V  V      subscript  V  S    subscript  V  V            e    1  e       n=\frac{V_{V}}{V_{T}}=\frac{V_{V}}{V_{S}+V_{V}}=\frac{e}{1+e}     where   e   e   e   is void ratio,   n   n   n   is porosity , V V is the volume of void-space (air and water), V S is the volume of solids, and V T is the total or bulk volume. 3  Engineering applications   Volume change tendency control. If void ratio is high (loose soils) voids in a soil skeleton tend to minimize under loading - adjacent particles contract. The opposite situation, i.e. when void ratio is relatively small (dense soils), indicates that the volume of the soil is vulnerable to increase under loading - particles dilate.    Fluid conductivity control (ability of water movement through the soil). Loose soils show high conductivity, while dense soils are not so permeable.    Particles movement. In a loose soil particles can move quite easily, whereas in a dense one finer particles cannot pass through the voids, which leads to clogging.
