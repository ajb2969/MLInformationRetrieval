   Li's criterion      Li's criterion   In number theory , Li's criterion is a particular statement about the positivity of a certain sequence that is completely equivalent to the Riemann hypothesis . The criterion is named after Xian-Jin Li, who presented it in 1997. Recently, Enrico Bombieri and Jeffrey C. Lagarias provided a generalization, showing that Li's positivity condition applies to any collection of points that lie on the Re s = 1/2 axis.  Definition  The Riemann ξ function is given by       ξ   (  s  )    =    1  2   s   (   s  -  1   )    π   -   s  /  2     Γ   (   s  2   )   ζ   (  s  )          ξ  s       1  2   s    s  1    superscript  π      s  2     normal-Γ    s  2   ζ  s     \xi(s)=\frac{1}{2}s(s-1)\pi^{-s/2}\Gamma\left(\frac{s}{2}\right)\zeta(s)     where ζ is the Riemann zeta function . Consider the sequence        λ  n   =      1    (   n  -  1   )   !      d  n    d   s  n      [    s   n  -  1     log  ξ    (  s  )    ]    |    s  =  1     .       subscript  λ  n    evaluated-at      1      n  1        superscript  d  n     d   superscript  s  n      delimited-[]     superscript  s    n  1      ξ   s       s  1      \lambda_{n}=\frac{1}{(n-1)!}\left.\frac{d^{n}}{ds^{n}}\left[s^{n-1}\log\xi(s)%
 \right]\right|_{s=1}.     Li's criterion is then the statement that   ''the Riemann hypothesis is completely equivalent to the statement that     λ  n   >  0       subscript  λ  n   0    \lambda_{n}>0   for every positive integer n .''   The numbers    λ  n     subscript  λ  n    \lambda_{n}   may also be expressed in terms of the non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function:       λ  n   =    ∑  ρ    [   1  -    (   1  -   1  ρ    )   n    ]         subscript  λ  n     subscript   ρ    delimited-[]    1   superscript    1    1  ρ    n        \lambda_{n}=\sum_{\rho}\left[1-\left(1-\frac{1}{\rho}\right)^{n}\right]     where the sum extends over ρ, the non-trivial zeros of the zeta function. This conditionally convergent sum should be understood in the sense that is usually used in number theory, namely, that        ∑  ρ   =    lim   N  →  ∞     ∑    |   ℑ   (  ρ  )    |   ≤  N      .       subscript   ρ     subscript    normal-→  N      subscript         ρ    N       \sum_{\rho}=\lim_{N\to\infty}\sum_{|\Im(\rho)|\leq N}.     A generalization  Bombieri and Lagarias demonstrate that a similar criterion holds for any collection of complex numbers, and is thus not restricted to the Riemann hypothesis. More precisely, let R = { ρ } be any collection of complex numbers ρ , not containing ρ = 1, which satisfies         ∑  ρ     1  +   |   ℜ   (  ρ  )    |      (   1  +   |  ρ  |    )   2     <  ∞   .        subscript   ρ       1      ρ      superscript    1    ρ    2        \sum_{\rho}\frac{1+\left|\Re(\rho)\right|}{(1+|\rho|)^{2}}<\infty.     Then one may make several equivalent statements about such a set. One such statement is the following:   One has     ℜ   (  ρ  )    ≤   1  /  2         ρ     1  2     \Re(\rho)\leq 1/2   for every ρ if and only if  : \sum_\rho\Re\left[1-\left(1-\frac{1}{\rho}\right)^{-n}\right]    \ge 0 for all positive integers n .  One may make a more interesting statement, if the set R obeys a certain functional equation under the replacement s ↦ 1 − s . Namely, if, whenever ρ is in R , then both the complex conjugate    ρ  ¯     normal-¯  ρ    \overline{\rho}   and    1  -  ρ      1  ρ    1-\rho   are in R , then Li's criterion can be stated as:   One has Re( ρ ) = 1/2 for every  ρ  if and only if            ∑  ρ    [   1  -    (   1  -   1  ρ    )   n    ]    ≥  0.        subscript   ρ    delimited-[]    1   superscript    1    1  ρ    n      0.    \sum_{\rho}\left[1-\left(1-\frac{1}{\rho}\right)^{n}\right]\geq 0.        Bombieri and Lagarias also show that Li's criterion follows from Weil's criterion for the Riemann hypothesis.  References           "  Category:Zeta and L-functions
