   Quasireversibility      Quasireversibility  In [[queueing theory]], a discipline within the mathematical [[probability theory|theory of probability]], '''quasireversibility''' (sometimes '''QR''') is a property of some queues. The concept was first identified by [[Richard R. Muntz]] {{cite te chreport|last=Muntz|first=R.R.|year=1972|title=Poisson departure process and queueing networks (IBM Research Report RC 4145)|url= http://domino.research.ibm.com/library/cyberdig.nsf/1e4115aea78b6e7c85256b360066f0d4/20b9b17a2db64886852574ef005775ce|institution=IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center|location=Yorktown Heights, N.Y.|}} and further developed by Frank Kelly . 1 2 Quasireversibility differs from reversibility in that a stronger condition is imposed on arrival rates and a weaker condition is applied on probability fluxes. For example, an M/M/1 queue with state-dependent arrival rates and state-dependent service times is reversible, but not quasireversible. 3  A network of queues, such that each individual queue when considered in isolation is quasireversible, always has a product form stationary distribution. 4 Quasireversibility had been conjectured to be a necessary condition for a product form solution in a queueing network, but this was shown not to be the case. Chao et al. exhibited a product form network where quasireversibility was not satisfied. 5  Definition  A queue with stationary distribution   π   π   \pi   is quasireversible if its state at time t , x (t) is independent of   the arrival times for each class of customer subsequent to time t ,  the departure times for each class of customer prior to time t   for all classes of customer. 6  Partial balance formulation  Quasireversibility is equivalent to a particular form of partial balance . First, define the reversed rates q'( x , x ') by       π   (  𝐱  )    q  ′    (  𝐱  ,   𝐱  ′   )    =   π   (   𝐱  ′   )   q   (   𝐱  ′   ,  𝐱  )          π  𝐱   superscript  q  normal-′    𝐱   superscript  𝐱  normal-′       π   superscript  𝐱  normal-′   q    superscript  𝐱  normal-′   𝐱      \pi(\mathbf{x})q^{\prime}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x^{\prime}})=\pi(\mathbf{x^{%
 \prime}})q(\mathbf{x^{\prime}},\mathbf{x})     then considering just customers of a particular class, the arrival and departure processes are the same Poisson process (with parameter   α   α   \alpha   ), so      α  =    ∑    𝐱  ′   ∈   M  𝐱      q   (  𝐱  ,   𝐱  ′   )     =    ∑    𝐱  ′   ∈   M  𝐱       q  ′    (  𝐱  ,   𝐱  ′   )           α    subscript      superscript  𝐱  normal-′    subscript  M  𝐱       q   𝐱   superscript  𝐱  normal-′             subscript      superscript  𝐱  normal-′    subscript  M  𝐱        superscript  q  normal-′    𝐱   superscript  𝐱  normal-′         \alpha=\sum_{\mathbf{x^{\prime}}\in M_{\mathbf{x}}}q(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x^{%
 \prime}})=\sum_{\mathbf{x^{\prime}}\in M_{\mathbf{x}}}q^{\prime}(\mathbf{x},%
 \mathbf{x^{\prime}})     where M x is a set such that     𝐱  ′   ∈   M  𝐱        superscript  𝐱  normal-′    subscript  M  𝐱     \scriptstyle{\mathbf{x^{\prime}}\in M_{\mathbf{x}}}   means the state x ' represents a single arrival of the particular class of customer to state x .  Examples   Burke's theorem shows that an M/M/m queueing system is quasireversible. 7 8 9  Kelly showed that each station of a BCMP network is quasireversible when viewed in isolation. 10  G-queues in G-networks are quasireversible. 11   See also  :* Time reversibility  References  "  Category:Queueing theory  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  ↩  ↩  Kelly, F.P.
