   Area compatibility factor      Area compatibility factor   In survival analysis , the area compatibility factor , F , is used in indirect standardisation of population mortality rates .      F  =      ∑  x     E   x  ,  t   c    s    m   x  ,  t      s       ∑  x    E   x  ,  t   c    s     /     ∑  x     E   x  ,  t   c    m   x  ,  t      s       ∑  x    E   x  ,  t   c          F   normal-/      subscript   x      superscript   superscript   subscript  E   x  t    c   s    superscript   subscript  m   x  t    s       subscript   x    superscript   superscript   subscript  E   x  t    c   s         subscript   x      superscript   subscript  E   x  t    c    superscript   subscript  m   x  t    s       subscript   x    superscript   subscript  E   x  t    c        F=\frac{\sum_{x}{}^{s}E_{x,t}^{c}{}^{s}m_{x,t}}{\sum_{x}{}^{s}E_{x,t}^{c}}%
 \left/\frac{\sum_{x}E_{x,t}^{c}{}^{s}m_{x,t}}{\sum_{x}E_{x,t}^{c}}\right.     where:      E   x  ,  t   c    s     superscript   superscript   subscript  E   x  t    c   s    {}^{s}E_{x,t}^{c}   is the standardised central exposed to risk from age x to x + t for the standard population,      E   x  ,  t   c     superscript   subscript  E   x  t    c    E_{x,t}^{c}   is the central exposed to risk from age x to x + t for the population under study and      m   x  ,  t      s     superscript   subscript  m   x  t    s    {}^{s}m_{x,t}   is the mortality rate in the standard population for ages x to x + t .  The expression can be thought of as the crude mortality rate for the standard population divided by what the crude mortality rate is for the region being studied, assuming the mortality rates are the same as for the standard population.  F is then multiplied by the crude mortality rate to arrive at the indirectly standardised mortality rate.  References  "  Category:Actuarial science  Category:Demography  Category:Epidemiology
