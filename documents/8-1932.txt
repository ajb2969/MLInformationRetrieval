In statistics, the inverse Wishart distribution, also called the inverted Wishart distribution, is a probability distribution defined on real-valued positive-definite matrices. In Bayesian statistics it is used as the conjugate prior for the covariance matrix of a multivariate normal distribution.
We say 
 
 
 
  follows an inverse Wishart distribution, denoted as 
 
 
 
 , if its inverse

 
  has a Wishart distribution

 
 . Important identities have been derived for Inverse-Wishart distribution.2
Density
The probability density function of the inverse Wishart is:



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
positive definite matrices, and Γp(·) is the multivariate gamma function.
Theorems
Distribution of the inverse of a Wishart-distributed matrix
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is of size 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  has an inverse Wishart distribution

Marginal and conditional distributions from an inverse Wishart-distributed matrix
Suppose 
 
 
 
  has an inverse Wishart distribution. Partition the matrices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
conformably with each other


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  matrices, then we have
i) 
 
 
 
  is independent of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Schur complement of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 ;
ii) 
 
 
 
 ;
iii) 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is a matrix normal distribution;
iv) 
 
 
 
 , where

Conjugate distribution
Suppose we wish to make inference about a covariance matrix 
 
 
 
  whose prior

 
  has a 
 
 
 
 
  distribution. If the observations 
 
 
 
  are independent p-variate Gaussian variables drawn from a 
 
 
 
  distribution, then the conditional distribution 
 
 
 
  has a 
 
 
 
  distribution, where 
 
 
 
 
 .
Because the prior and posterior distributions are the same family, we say the inverse Wishart distribution is conjugate to the multivariate Gaussian.
Due to its conjugacy to the multivariate Gaussian, it is possible to marginalize out (integrate out) the Gaussian's parameter 
 
 
 
 .



(this is useful because the variance matrix 
 
 
 
  is not known in practice, but because 
 
 
 
  is known a priori, and 
 
 
 
 
  can be obtained from the data, the right hand side can be evaluated directly). The inverse-Wishart distribution as a prior can be constructed via existing transferred prior knowledge.4
Moments
The following is based on Press, S. J. (1982) "Applied Multivariate Analysis", 2nd ed. (Dover Publications, New York), after reparameterizing the degree of freedom to be consistent with the p.d.f. definition above.
The mean:5



The variance of each element of

  The variance of the diagonal uses the same formula as above with 
 
 
 
 , which simplifies to:


 
  The covariance of elements of 
 
 
 
  are given by:



Related distributions
A univariate specialization of the inverse-Wishart distribution is the inverse-gamma distribution. With 
 
 
 
  (i.e. univariate) and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the probability density function of the inverse-Wishart distribution becomes



i.e., the inverse-gamma distribution, where 
 
 
 
  is the ordinary Gamma function.
A generalization is the inverse multivariate gamma distribution.
Another generalization has been termed the generalized inverse Wishart distribution, 
 
 
 
 . A 
 
 
 
  positive definite matrix 
 
 
 
  is said to be distributed as 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is distributed as 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  denotes the symmetric matrix square root of 
 
 
 
 , the parameters 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  positive definite matrices, and the parameter 
 
 
 
  is a positive scalar larger than 
 
 
 
 . Note that when 
 
 
 
  is equal to an identity matrix, 
 
 
 
 . This generalized inverse Wishart distribution has been applied to estimating the distributions of multivariate autoregressive processes.6
A different type of generalization is the normal-inverse-Wishart distribution, essentially the product of a multivariate normal distribution with an inverse Wishart distribution.
