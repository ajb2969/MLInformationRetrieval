   3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-monooxygenase      3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (6aR,11aR)-3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (6aS,11aS)-3,6a,9-trihydroxypterocarpan + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are (6aR,11aR)-3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are (6aS,11aS)-3,6a,9-trihydroxypterocarpan , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (6aR,11aR)-3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (6a-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6a-hydroxylase , and 3,9-dihydroxypterocarpan 6alpha-monooxygenase (erroneous) . This enzyme participates in isoflavonoid biosynthesis . It employs one cofactor , heme .
