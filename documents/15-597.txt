   Mu to E Gamma      Mu to E Gamma   The Mu to E Gamma ( MEG ) is a particle physics experiment dedicated to measuring the decay of the muon into an electron and a photon , a decay mode which is heavily suppressed in the Standard Model by lepton flavour conservation , but enhanced in supersymmetry and grand unified theories . 1 It is located at the Paul Scherrer Institute and began taking data September 2008.  MEG use a continues muon beam (3 × 10 7 /s) incident on a plastic target. The decay is reconstructed to look for a back-to-back positron and monochromatic photon (52.8 MeV). A liquid xenon scintillator with PMTs measure the photon energy and a drift chamber in a magnetic field detects the positrons.  In March 2013 the MEG experiment published the world's leading upper limit on the branching ratio of this decay:       \Beta    (   μ  +   →   e  +   γ  )   <  5.7  ×   10   -  13       fragments  \Beta   fragments  normal-(   superscript  μ    normal-→   superscript  e    γ  normal-)    5.7    superscript  10    13      \Beta(\mu^{+}\to e^{+}\gamma)<5.7\times 10^{-13}     at 90% confidence level, 2 based on data collected in 2009–2011. This improved the MEG limit from data up to 2010. These replace prior limits from the MEGA experiment. 3  The MEG collaboration presented upgrade plans for MEG-II at the Particles and Nuclei International Conference 2014, with an order more sensitivity and increased muon production to begin data taking in 2016. 4 More experiments are planned that will explore this process such as Mu2e .
