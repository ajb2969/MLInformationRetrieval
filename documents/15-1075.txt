Ketosteroid monooxygenase

Ketosteroid monooxygenase (, steroid-ketone monooxygenase, progesterone, NADPH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (20-hydroxylating, ester-producing), 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, NADPH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (20-hydroxylating, side-chain cleaving), androstenedione, NADPH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (17-hydroxylating, lactonizing)) is an enzyme with system name ketosteroid,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (20-hydroxylating, ester-producing/20-hydroxylating, side-chain cleaving/17-hydroxylating, lactonizing).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ketosteroid + NADPH + H+ + O2 $\rightleftharpoons$ steroid ester/lactone + NADP+ + H2O (general reaction)
 
(1) progesterone + NADPH + H+ + O2 $\rightleftharpoons$ testosterone acetate + NADP+ + H2O
 
(2) androstenedione + NADPH + H+ + O2 $\rightleftharpoons$ testololactone + NADP+ + H2O
 
(3) 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone + NADPH + H+ + O2 $\rightleftharpoons$ androstenedione + acetate + NADP+ + H2O
 

Ketosteroid monooxygenase is a single FAD-containing enzyme that catalyses three types of monooxygenase reaction.
