   Ketosteroid monooxygenase      Ketosteroid monooxygenase   Ketosteroid monooxygenase (, steroid-ketone monooxygenase , progesterone, NADPH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (20-hydroxylating, ester-producing) , 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone, NADPH 2 :oxygen oxidoreductase (20-hydroxylating, side-chain cleaving) , androstenedione, NADPH 2 :oxygen oxidoreductase (17-hydroxylating, lactonizing) ) is an enzyme with system name ketosteroid,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (20-hydroxylating, ester-producing/20-hydroxylating, side-chain cleaving/17-hydroxylating, lactonizing) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ketosteroid + NADPH + H + + O 2  $\rightleftharpoons$  steroid  ester / lactone + NADP + + H 2 O (general reaction)  (1) progesterone + NADPH + H + + O 2  $\rightleftharpoons$ testosterone acetate + NADP + + H 2 O  (2) androstenedione + NADPH + H + + O 2  $\rightleftharpoons$ testololactone + NADP + + H 2 O  (3) 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone + NADPH + H + + O 2  $\rightleftharpoons$  androstenedione + acetate + NADP + + H 2 O   Ketosteroid monooxygenase is a single FAD-containing enzyme that catalyses three types of monooxygenase reaction.
