<p>In <a href="game_theory" title="wikilink">game theory</a>, and in particular the study of <a class="uri" href="zero-sum" title="wikilink">zero-sum</a> <a href="continuous_game" title="wikilink">continuous games</a>, it is commonly assumed that a game has a <a class="uri" href="minimax" title="wikilink">minimax</a> value. This is the <a href="expected_value" title="wikilink">expected value</a> to one of the players when both play a perfect strategy (which is to choose from a particular <a href="probability_density_function" title="wikilink">PDF</a>).</p>
<p>This article gives an example of a <a href="zero_sum_game" title="wikilink">zero sum game</a> that has no <a href="minimax" title="wikilink">value</a>. It is due to Sion and Wolfe.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Zero sum games with a finite number of pure strategies are known to have a <a class="uri" href="minimax" title="wikilink">minimax</a> value (originally proved by <a href="John_von_Neumann" title="wikilink">John von Neumann</a>) but this is not necessarily the case if the game has an infinite set of strategies. There follows a simple example of a game with no minimax value.</p>
<p>The existence of such zero-sum games is interesting because many of the results of <a href="game_theory" title="wikilink">game theory</a> become inapplicable if there is no minimax value.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The game</h2>
<p>Players I and II each choose a number, <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$y$</span> respectively, with <span class="LaTeX">$x,y\in[0,1]$</span>; the payoff to I is</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$K(x,y)=
\begin{cases}
  -1 & \text{if } x<y<x+1 &="" 0="" 1="" 2="" \\="" \end{cases}<="" \text{="" \text{if="" \text{otherwise}="" math="" or="" x="y" y="x+1/2\\" }="">

(i.e. player II pays <math>K(x,y)$$</span> to player I;the game is <a class="uri" href="zero-sum" title="wikilink">zero-sum</a>). Sometimes player I is referred to as the <em>maximizing player</em> and player II the <em>minimizing player</em>.</p>
<p>If <span class="LaTeX">$(x,y)$</span> is interpreted as a point on the unit square, the figure shows the payoff to player I. Now suppose that player I adopts a mixed strategy: choosing a number from <a href="probability_density_function" title="wikilink">probability density function (pdf)</a> <span class="LaTeX">$f$</span>; player II chooses from <span class="LaTeX">$g$</span>. Player I seeks to maximize the payoff, player II to minimize the payoff. Note that each player is aware of the other's objective.</p>
<h2 id="game-value">Game value</h2>
<p>Sion and Wolfe show that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\sup_f \inf_g \iint K\,df\,dg=\frac{1}{3}$$</span></p>
<p>but</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\inf_g \sup_f \iint K\,df\,dg=\frac{3}{7}.$$</span></p>
<p>These are the maximal and minimal expectations of the game's value of player I and II respectively.</p>
<p>The <span class="LaTeX">$\sup$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\inf$</span> respectively take the supremum and infimum over pdf's on the unit interval (actually <a href="Borel_measure" title="wikilink">Borel probability measures</a>). These represent player I and player II's (mixed) strategies. Thus, player I can assure himself of a payoff of at least 3/7 if he knows player II's strategy; and player II can hold the payoff down to 1/3 if he knows player I's strategy.</p>
<p>There is clearly no <a href="epsilon_equilibrium" title="wikilink">epsilon equilibrium</a> for sufficiently small <span class="LaTeX">$\epsilon$</span>, specifically, if <span class="LaTeX">$\epsilon < \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{3}{7}-\frac{1}{3}\right)\simeq  0.0476$</span>. Dasgupta and Maskin<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> assert that the game values are achieved if player I puts probability weight only on the set <span class="LaTeX">$\left\{0,1/2,1\right\}$</span> and player II puts weight only on <span class="LaTeX">$\left\{1/4,1/2,1\right\}$</span>.</p>
<p><a href="Glicksberg's_theorem" title="wikilink">Glicksberg's theorem</a> shows that any zero-sum game with <a href="upper_semicontinuous" title="wikilink">upper</a> or <a href="lower_semicontinuous" title="wikilink">lower semicontinuous</a> payoff function has a value (in this context, an upper (lower) semicontinuous function <em>K</em> is one in which the set <span class="LaTeX">$\{P|K(P)<c\}< math=""> (resp <math>\{P|K(P)>c\}$</span>) is <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open</a> for any <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real</a> <em>c</em>).</p>
<p>Observe that the payoff function of Sion and Wolfe's example is clearly not semicontinuous. However, it may be made so by changing the value of <em>K</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>x</em>) and <em>K</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>x</em> + 1/2) [i.e. the payoff along the two discontinuities] to either +1 or −1, making the payoff upper or lower semicontinuous respectively. If this is done, the game then has a value.</p>

<p>Subsequent work by Heuer <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> discusses a class of games in which the unit square is divided into three regions, the payoff function being constant in each of the regions.</p>
