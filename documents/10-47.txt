   Decision Linear assumption      Decision Linear assumption   The Decision Linear (DLIN) assumption is a computational hardness assumption used in elliptic curve cryptography . In particular, the DLIN assumption is useful in settings where the decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption does not hold (as is often the case in pairing-based cryptography ). The Decision Linear assumption was introduced by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham. 1  Informally the DLIN assumption states that given    (  f  ,  g  ,   f  x   ,   g  y   )     f  g   superscript  f  x    superscript  g  y     (f,\,g,\,f^{x},\,g^{y})   , with    f  ,  g     f  g    f,\,g   random group elements and    x  ,  y     x  y    x,\,y   random exponents, it is hard to distinguish    (  h  ,   h   x  +  y    )     h   superscript  h    x  y      (h,\,h^{x+y})   (for random   h   h   h   ) from    (  h  ,   h  ′   )     h   superscript  h  normal-′     (h,\,h^{\prime})   (for independently random    h  ,   h  ′      h   superscript  h  normal-′     h,\,h^{\prime}   ).
