Moduli stack of formal group laws

In algebraic geometry, the moduli stack of formal group laws is a stack classifying formal group laws and isomorphisms between them. It is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . It is a "geometric “object" that underlies the chromatic approach to the stable homotopy theory, a branch of algebraic topology.
Currently, it is not known whether 
 
 
 
  is a derived stack or not. Hence, it is typical to work with stratifications. Let 
 
 
 
  be given so that 
 
 
 
 
  consists of formal group laws over R of height exactly n. They form a stratification of the moduli stack 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is faithfully flat. In fact, 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is a profinite group called the Morava stabilizer group. The Lubin–Tate theory describes how the strata 
 
 
 
  fit together.
