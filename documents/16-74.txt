   Alpha-longipinene synthase      Alpha-longipinene synthase   Alpha-longipinene synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (alpha-longipinene-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha-longipinene + diphosphate    The enzyme from Norway spruce produces longifolene as the main product.
