   Chapman function      Chapman function   A Chapman function describes the integration of atmospheric absorption along a slant path on a spherical earth, relative to the vertical case. It applies for any quantity with a concentration decreasing exponentially with increasing altitude . To a first approximation, valid at small zenith  angles , the Chapman function for optical absorption is equal to       s  e  c   (  z  )    ,      s  e  c  z    sec(z),     where z is the zenith angle and sec denotes the secant function .  The Chapman function is named after Sydney Chapman .
