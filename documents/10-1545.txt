Prenylcysteine oxidase

In enzymology, a prenylcysteine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

an S-prenyl-L-cysteine + O2 + H2O 
 
 
 
  a prenal + L-cysteine + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are S-prenyl-L-cysteine, O2, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are prenal, L-cysteine, and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-prenyl-L-cysteine:oxygen oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called prenylcysteine lyase.
