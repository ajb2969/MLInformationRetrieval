   Prenylcysteine oxidase      Prenylcysteine oxidase   In enzymology , a prenylcysteine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an S-prenyl-L-cysteine + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a prenal + L-cysteine + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are S-prenyl-L-cysteine , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are prenal , L-cysteine , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-prenyl-L-cysteine:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called prenylcysteine lyase .
