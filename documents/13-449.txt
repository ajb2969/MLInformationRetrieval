   Kirchhoff integral theorem      Kirchhoff integral theorem   Kirchhoff 's integral theorem (sometimes referred to as the Fresnel-Kirchhoff integral theorem) 1 uses Green's identities to derive the solution to the homogeneous wave equation at an arbitrary point P in terms of the values of the solution of the wave equation and its first-order derivative at all points on an arbitrary surface that encloses P . 2  Equation  Monochromatic waves  The integral has the following form for a monochromatic wave: 3 4        U   (  𝐫  )    =    1   4  π      ∫  S     [    U   ∂   ∂   𝐧  ^      (    e   i  k  s    s   )    -     e   i  k  s    s     ∂  U    ∂   𝐧  ^       ]   d  S      ,        U  𝐫       1    4  π      subscript   S      delimited-[]      U        normal-^  𝐧        superscript  e    i  k  s    s         superscript  e    i  k  s    s       U      normal-^  𝐧        d  S       U(\mathbf{r})=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{S}\left[U\frac{\partial}{\partial\hat{%
 \mathbf{n}}}\left(\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\right)-\frac{e^{iks}}{s}\frac{\partial U}{%
 \partial\hat{\mathbf{n}}}\right]dS,     where the integration is performed over an arbitrary closed surface  S (enclosing r ), s is the distance from the surface element to the point r , and ∂/∂ n denotes differentiation along the surface normal (a normal derivative ). Note that in this equation the normal points inside the enclosed volume; if the more usual outer-pointing normal is used, the integral has the opposite sign.  Non-monochromatic waves  A more general form can be derived for non-monochromatic waves. The complex amplitude of the wave can be represented by a Fourier integral of the form:        V   (  r  ,  t  )    =    1    2  π      ∫    U  ω    (  r  )     e   -   i  ω  t      d  ω      ,        V   r  t        1      2  π          subscript  U  ω   r   superscript  e      i  ω  t     d  ω       V(r,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int U_{\omega}(r)e^{-i\omega t}\,d\omega,     where, by Fourier inversion , we have:         U  ω    (  r  )    =    1    2  π      ∫   V   (  r  ,  t  )     e   i  ω  t     d  t      .         subscript  U  ω   r       1      2  π         V   r  t    superscript  e    i  ω  t    d  t       U_{\omega}(r)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int V(r,t)e^{i\omega t}\,dt.     The integral theorem (above) is applied to each Fourier component , and the following expression is obtained: 5        V   (  r  ,  t  )    =    1   4  π      ∫  S     {     [  V  ]    ∂   ∂  n     (   1  s   )    -    1   c  s      ∂  s    ∂  n     [    ∂  V    ∂  t    ]    -    1  s    [    ∂  V    ∂  n    ]     }   d  S      ,        V   r  t        1    4  π      subscript   S           delimited-[]  V        n      1  s        1    c  s        s     n     delimited-[]      V     t          1  s    delimited-[]      V     n        d  S       V(r,t)=\frac{1}{4\pi}\int_{S}\left\{[V]\frac{\partial}{\partial n}\left(\frac{%
 1}{s}\right)-\frac{1}{cs}\frac{\partial s}{\partial n}\left[\frac{\partial V}{%
 \partial t}\right]-\frac{1}{s}\left[\frac{\partial V}{\partial n}\right]\right%
 \}dS,     where the square brackets on V terms denote retarded values, i.e. the values at time t − s / c .  Kirchhoff showed the above equation can be approximated in many cases to a simpler form, known as the Kirchhoff, or Fresnel–Kirchhoff diffraction formula , which is equivalent to the Huygens–Fresnel equation , but provides a formula for the inclination factor, which is not defined in the latter. The diffraction integral can be applied to a wide range of problems in optics.
