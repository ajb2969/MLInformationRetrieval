   Xylosylprotein 4-beta-galactosyltransferase      Xylosylprotein 4-beta-galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a xylosylprotein 4-beta-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + O-beta-D-xylosylprotein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and O-beta-D-xylosylprotein , whereas its two products are UDP and 4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:O-beta-D-xylosylprotein 4-beta-D-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP-D-galactose:D-xylose galactosyltransferase , UDP-D-galactose:xylose galactosyltransferase , galactosyltransferase I , and uridine diphosphogalactose-xylose galactosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 . It employs one cofactor , manganese .
