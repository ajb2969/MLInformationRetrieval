Bi-twin chain

In number theory, a bi-twin chain of length k + 1 is a sequence of natural numbers



in which every number is prime.1
The numbers 
 
 
 
  form a Cunningham chain of the first kind of length 
 
 
 
 , while 
 
 
 
 
  forms a Cunningham chain of the second kind. Each of the pairs 
 
 
 
  is a pair of twin primes. Each of the primes 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  is a Sophie Germain prime and each of the primes 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 
  is a safe prime.
