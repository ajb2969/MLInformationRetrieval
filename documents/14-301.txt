Semiorder

 In order theory, a branch of mathematics, a semiorder is a type of ordering that may be determined for a set of items with numerical scores by declaring two items to be incomparable when their scores are within a given margin of error of each other, and by using the numerical comparison of their scores when those scores are sufficiently far apart. Semiorders were introduced and applied in mathematical psychology by  as a model of human preference without the assumption that indifference is transitive. They generalize strict weak orderings, form a special case of partial orders and interval orders, and can be characterized among the partial orders by two forbidden four-item suborders.
Definition
Let X be a set of items, and let  describes an equivalent set of four axioms, the first two of which combine the definition of incomparability and the first axiom listed here.

For all x and y, it is not possible for both x < y and y < x to be true. That is, < must be an irreflexive, antisymmetric relation
For all x, y, z, and w, if it is true that x < y, y ~ z, and z < w, then it must also be true that x < w.
For all x, y, z, and w, if it is true that x < y, y < z, and y ~ w, then it cannot also be true that x ~ w and z ~ w simultaneously.

It follows from the first axiom that x ~ x, and therefore the second axiom (with y = z) implies that , p. 179.
Thus, suppose that X is a set of items, and u is a utility function that maps the members of X to real numbers. A strict weak ordering can be defined on x by declaring two items to be incomparable when they have equal utilities, and otherwise using the numerical comparison, but this necessarily leads to a transitive incomparability relation. Instead, if one sets a numerical threshold (which may be normalized to 1) such that utilities within that threshold of each other are declared incomparable, then a semiorder arises.
Specifically, define a binary relation , Theorem 3 describes a more general situation in which the threshold for comparability between two utilities is a function of the utility rather than being identically 1. It may equivalently be defined as the interval order defined by the intervals [u(x),u(x) + 1].1
The converse is not necessarily true: for instance, if a semiorder (X,This result is typically credited to ; see, e.g., . However, , Theorem 2 proves a more general statement, that a finite semiorder can be defined from a utility function and a threshold function whenever a certain underlying weak order can be defined numerically. For finite semiorders, it is trivial that the weak order can be defined numerically with a unit threshold function.  supplies a precise characterization of the semiorders that may be defined numerically.

Any finite semiorder has order dimension at most three.4
Among all partial orders with a fixed number of elements and a fixed number of comparable pairs, the partial orders that have the largest number of linear extensions are semiorders.5
Semiorders are known to obey the 1/3–2/3 conjecture: in any finite semiorder that is not a total order, there exists a pair of elements x and y such that x appears earlier than y in between 1/3 and 2/3 of the linear extensions of the semiorder.6
The set of semiorders on an n-element set is well-graded: if two semiorders on the same set differ from each other by the addition or removal of k order relations, then it is possible to find a path of k steps from the first semiorder to the second one, in such a way that each step of the path adds or removes a single order relation and each intermediate state in the path is itself a semiorder.7
The incomparability graphs of semiorders are called indifference graphs, and are a special case of the interval graphs.8
