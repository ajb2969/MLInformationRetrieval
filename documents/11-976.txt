   Putrescine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase      Putrescine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase   In enzymology , a putrescine N-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   caffeoyl-CoA + putrescine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-caffeoylputrescine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are caffeoyl-CoA and putrescine , whereas its two products are CoA and N-caffeoylputrescine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is caffeoyl-CoA:putrescine N-(3,4-dihydroxycinnamoyl)transferase . Other names in common use include caffeoyl-CoA putrescine N-caffeoyl transferase , PHT , putrescine hydroxycinnamoyl transferase , hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:putrescine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase , and putrescine hydroxycinnamoyltransferase .
