   Squeeze theorem      Squeeze theorem   In calculus , the squeeze theorem (known also as the pinching theorem , the sandwich theorem , the sandwich rule and sometimes the squeeze lemma ) is a theorem regarding the limit of a function .  The squeeze theorem is used in calculus and mathematical analysis . It is typically used to confirm the limit of a function via comparison with two other functions whose limits are known or easily computed. It was first used geometrically by the mathematicians  Archimedes and Eudoxus in an effort to compute    π   π   \pi    , and was formulated in modern terms by Gauss .  In many languages (e.g. French, German and Italian), the squeeze theorem is also known as the two policemen (and a drunk) theorem , or some variation thereof. The story is that if two policemen are escorting a drunk prisoner between them, and both officers go to a cell, then (regardless of the path taken, and the fact that the prisoner may be wobbling about between the policemen) the prisoner must also end up in the cell.  Statement  The squeeze theorem is formally stated as follows.   Let I be an interval having the point a as a limit point. Let f , g , and h be functions defined on I , except possibly at a itself. Suppose that for every x in I not equal to a , we have:       g   (  x  )    ≤   f   (  x  )    ≤   h   (  x  )            g  x     f  x          h  x      g(x)\leq f(x)\leq h(x)\,     and also suppose that:         lim   x  →  a     g   (  x  )     =    lim   x  →  a     h   (  x  )     =  L   .          subscript    normal-→  x  a      g  x      subscript    normal-→  x  a      h  x         L     \lim_{x\to a}g(x)=\lim_{x\to a}h(x)=L.\,     Then       lim   x  →  a     f   (  x  )     =  L   .        subscript    normal-→  x  a      f  x    L    \lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L.       The functions g and h are said to be lower and upper bounds (respectively) of f .  Here a is not required to lie in the interior of I . Indeed, if a is an endpoint of I , then the above limits are left- or right-hand limits.  A similar statement holds for infinite intervals: for example, if I = (0, ∞), then the conclusion holds, taking the limits as x → ∞.   Proof  From the above hypotheses we have, taking the limit inferior and superior:       L  =    lim   x  →  a     g   (  x  )     ≤    lim inf   x  →  a     f   (  x  )     ≤    lim sup   x  →  a     f   (  x  )     ≤    lim   x  →  a     h   (  x  )     =  L   ,        L    subscript    normal-→  x  a      g  x           subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  x  a      f  x           subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  x  a      f  x           subscript    normal-→  x  a      h  x         L     L=\lim_{x\to a}g(x)\leq\liminf_{x\to a}f(x)\leq\limsup_{x\to a}f(x)\leq\lim_{x%
 \to a}h(x)=L,   so all the inequalities are indeed equalities, and the thesis immediately follows.  A direct proof, using the ( ε , δ ) definition of limit, would be to prove that for all real ε > 0 there exists a real δ > 0 such that for all x with 0  \forall \varepsilon > 0\ \exists \ \delta > 0 : \forall x\ (0 .  As        lim   x  →  a     g   (  x  )     =  L        subscript    normal-→  x  a      g  x    L    \lim_{x\to a}g(x)=L     means that      ∀  ε  >   0   ∃   δ  1   >  0  :  ∀   x    (  0  <  |  x  -  a  |  <    δ  1    ⇒  -  ε  <  g   (  x  )   -  L  <  ε  )   .

 \Rightarrow\ -\varepsilon     then we have       g   (  x  )    ≤   f   (  x  )    ≤   h   (  x  )            g  x     f  x          h  x      g(x)\leq f(x)\leq h(x)\,           g   (  x  )    -  L   ≤    f   (  x  )    -  L   ≤    h   (  x  )    -   L              g  x   L       f  x   L            h  x   L      g(x)-L\leq f(x)-L\leq h(x)-L\,     We can choose    δ  :=   min   {   δ  1   ,   δ  2   }       assign  δ     subscript  δ  1    subscript  δ  2      \delta:=\min\left\{\delta_{1},\delta_{2}\right\}   . Then, if     |   x  -  a   |   <  δ          x  a    δ    |x-a|<\delta   , combining (1) and (2), we have        -  ε   <    g   (  x  )    -  L   ≤    f   (  x  )    -  L   ≤    h   (  x  )    -   L    <  ε   ,          ε       g  x   L            f  x   L            h  x   L        ε     -\varepsilon          -  ε   <    f   (  x  )    -  L   <  ε          ε       f  x   L        ε     -\varepsilon   ,  which completes the proof.   ■   normal-■   \blacksquare     Examples  First example  (Figure)  x 2 sin(1/ x ) being squeezed in the limit as x goes to 0   The limit       lim   x  →  0      x  2    sin   (    1  x    )         subscript    normal-→  x  0       superscript  x  2       1  x       \lim_{x\to 0}x^{2}\sin(\tfrac{1}{x})     cannot be determined through the limit law         lim   x  →  a     (     f   (  x  )    ⋅  g    (  x  )    )    =    lim   x  →  a      f   (  x  )    ⋅    lim   x  →  a     g   (  x  )        ,        subscript    normal-→  x  a       normal-⋅    f  x   g   x      subscript    normal-→  x  a     normal-⋅    f  x     subscript    normal-→  x  a      g  x        \lim_{x\to a}(f(x)\cdot g(x))=\lim_{x\to a}f(x)\cdot\lim_{x\to a}g(x),     because       lim   x  →  0     sin   (    1  x    )        subscript    normal-→  x  0        1  x      \lim_{x\to 0}\sin(\tfrac{1}{x})     does not exist.  However, by the definition of the sine function ,       -  1   ≤   sin   (    1  x    )    ≤   1.           1       1  x         1.     -1\leq\sin(\tfrac{1}{x})\leq 1.\,     It follows that       -   x  2    ≤    x  2    sin   (    1  x    )     ≤    x  2             superscript  x  2       superscript  x  2       1  x           superscript  x  2      -x^{2}\leq x^{2}\sin(\tfrac{1}{x})\leq x^{2}\,     Since      lim   x  →  0    -   x  2    =    lim   x  →  0     x  2    =  0           subscript    normal-→  x  0     superscript  x  2      subscript    normal-→  x  0     superscript  x  2         0     \lim_{x\to 0}-x^{2}=\lim_{x\to 0}x^{2}=0   , by the squeeze theorem,     lim   x  →  0      x  2    sin   (   1  x   )         subscript    normal-→  x  0       superscript  x  2       1  x       \lim_{x\to 0}x^{2}\sin(\tfrac{1}{x})   must also be 0.  Second example  Probably the best-known examples of finding a limit by squeezing are the proofs of the equalities         lim   x  →  0       sin  x   x     =  1   ,        subscript    normal-→  x  0        x   x    1    \displaystyle\lim_{x\to 0}\frac{\sin x}{x}=1,     The first follows by means of the squeeze theorem from the fact that       cos  x   <    sin  x   x   <  1          x       x   x        1     \cos x<\frac{\sin x}{x}<1     for x close enough, but not equal to 0.  These two limits are used in proofs of the fact that the derivative of the sine function is the cosine function. That fact is relied on in other proofs of derivatives of trigonometric functions.  Third example  It is possible to show that        d   d  θ     tan  θ    =    sec  2   θ           d    d  θ      θ      superscript   2   θ     \frac{d}{d\theta}\tan\theta=\sec^{2}\theta     by squeezing, as follows.  (Figure)  Tangent.squeeze.svg   In the illustration at right, the area of the smaller of the two shaded sectors of the circle is         sec  2     θ   Δ  θ    2   ,        superscript   2     θ  normal-Δ  θ    2    \frac{\sec^{2}\theta\,\Delta\theta}{2},     since the radius is sec θ and the arc on the unit circle has length Δ θ . Similarly the area of the larger of the two shaded sectors is          sec  2    (   θ  +   Δ  θ    )    Δ  θ   2   .          superscript   2     θ    normal-Δ  θ     normal-Δ  θ   2    \frac{\sec^{2}(\theta+\Delta\theta)\,\Delta\theta}{2}.     What is squeezed between them is the triangle whose base is the vertical segment whose endpoints are the two dots. The length of the base of the triangle is tan( θ + Δ θ ) − tan( θ ), and the height is 1. The area of the triangle is therefore         tan   (   θ  +   Δ  θ    )    -   tan   (  θ  )     2   .            θ    normal-Δ  θ       θ    2    \frac{\tan(\theta+\Delta\theta)-\tan(\theta)}{2}.     From the inequalities         sec  2     θ   Δ  θ    2   ≤     tan   (   θ  +   Δ  θ    )    -   tan   (  θ  )     2   ≤      sec  2    (   θ  +   Δ  θ    )    Δ  θ   2             superscript   2     θ  normal-Δ  θ    2           θ    normal-Δ  θ       θ    2              superscript   2     θ    normal-Δ  θ     normal-Δ  θ   2      \frac{\sec^{2}\theta\,\Delta\theta}{2}\leq\frac{\tan(\theta+\Delta\theta)-\tan%
 (\theta)}{2}\leq\frac{\sec^{2}(\theta+\Delta\theta)\,\Delta\theta}{2}     we deduce that         sec  2   θ   ≤     tan   (   θ  +   Δ  θ    )    -   tan   (  θ  )      Δ  θ    ≤    sec  2    (   θ  +   Δ  θ    )     ,          superscript   2   θ           θ    normal-Δ  θ       θ      normal-Δ  θ           superscript   2     θ    normal-Δ  θ        \sec^{2}\theta\leq\frac{\tan(\theta+\Delta\theta)-\tan(\theta)}{\Delta\theta}%
 \leq\sec^{2}(\theta+\Delta\theta),     provided Δ θ > 0, and the inequalities are reversed if Δ θ 2 θ as Δ θ → 0, and the middle expression approaches ( d / dθ ) tan θ , the desired result follows.  Fourth example  The squeeze theorem can still be used in multivariable calculus but the lower (and upper functions) must be below (and above) the target function not just along a path but around the entire neighborhood of the point of interest and it only works if the function really does have a limit there. It can, therefore, be used to prove that a function has a limit at a point, but it can never be used to prove that a function does not have a limit at a point. 1       lim    (  x  ,  y  )   →   (  0  ,  0  )        x  2   y     x  2   +   y  2         subscript    normal-→   x  y    0  0          superscript  x  2   y      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}     cannot be found by taking any number of limits along paths that pass through the point, but since      0  ≤    x  2     x  2   +   y  2     ≤  1        0     superscript  x  2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2          1     0\leq\frac{x^{2}}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\leq 1          -   |  y  |    ≤  y  ≤   |  y  |             y    y         y      -\left|y\right|\leq y\leq\left|y\right|          -   |  y  |    ≤     x  2   y     x  2   +   y  2     ≤   |  y  |             y         superscript  x  2   y      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2            y      -\left|y\right|\leq\frac{x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\leq\left|y\right|           lim    (  x  ,  y  )   →   (  0  ,  0  )     -   |  y  |    =  0         subscript    normal-→   x  y    0  0       y    0    \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}-\left|y\right|=0           lim    (  x  ,  y  )   →   (  0  ,  0  )      |  y  |    =  0        subscript    normal-→   x  y    0  0       y    0    \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\left|y\right|=0         0  ≤    lim    (  x  ,  y  )   →   (  0  ,  0  )        x  2   y     x  2   +   y  2      ≤  0        0    subscript    normal-→   x  y    0  0          superscript  x  2   y      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2           0     0\leq\lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}\leq 0     therefore, by the squeeze theorem,        lim    (  x  ,  y  )   →   (  0  ,  0  )        x  2   y     x  2   +   y  2      =  0        subscript    normal-→   x  y    0  0          superscript  x  2   y      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      0    \lim_{(x,y)\to(0,0)}\frac{x^{2}y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}=0     References       External links   Squeeze Theorem by Bruce Atwood (Beloit College) after work by, Selwyn Hollis (Armstrong Atlantic State University), the Wolfram Demonstrations Project .
