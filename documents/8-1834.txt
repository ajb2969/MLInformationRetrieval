   Long wavelength limit      Long wavelength limit   In electricity and magnetism , the long wavelength limit is the limiting case when the wavelength is much larger than the system size. This corresponds to the quasi-static case, and reduces to electrostatics and magnetostatics .  The physical criterion is that    λ  ≫  a     much-greater-than  λ  a    \lambda>>a   , where   a   a   a   is the size of the system. The following statements are all equivalent:       λ  ≫  a     much-greater-than  λ  a    \lambda>>a          k  a   ≪  1     much-less-than    k  a   1    ka<<1   , where   k   k   k   is the wave vector        ω  c   a   ≪  1     much-less-than      ω  c   a   1    \frac{\omega}{c}a<<1   , where   ω   ω   \omega   is the angular frequency,   c   c   c   is the propagation speed of waves.
