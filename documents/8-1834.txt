Long wavelength limit




Long wavelength limit

In electricity and magnetism, the long wavelength limit is the limiting case when the wavelength is much larger than the system size. This corresponds to the quasi-static case, and reduces to electrostatics and magnetostatics.
The physical criterion is that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the size of the system. The following statements are all equivalent:






 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the wave vector


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the angular frequency, 
 
 
 
  is the propagation speed of waves.
