   Polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase      Polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase   In enzymology , a polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :   polyneuridine aldehyde + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   16-epivellosimine + CO 2 + methanol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are polyneuridine aldehyde and H 2 O , whereas its three products are 16-epivellosimine, CO 2 , and methanol . 1  This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is polyneuridine aldehyde hydrolase (decarboxylating). Other names in common use include:   polyneuridine aldehyde esterase  PNAE   Homologues  This enzyme is found in various forms in plant species such as Arabidopsis thaliana , Glycine max (soybean), Vitis vinifera (wine grape), and Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) among others.  Polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase also appears in select bacteria including Enterobacter cloacae .  Structure  The secondary structure of this enzyme consists mainly of alpha helices . In its native form, this enzyme has a tertiary structure that includes two main lobes (as depicted above in the blue 3D representation on the top right).

The carboxylic acid in the product spontaneously undergoes decarboxylation , yielding 16-epivellosimine and carbon dioxide. 2  Mechanism  (Figure)  Crystallographic structure of polyneuridine aldehyde esterase from Rauvolfia serpentina (rainbow colored, N-terminus = blue, C-terminus = red). The enzyme is complexed with its product 16-epi-vellosimine that is depicted as a space-filling model (carbon = white, oxygen = red, nitrogen = blue). 3   The mechanism of hydrolysis performed by polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase is not known. It has been suggested that the enzyme utilizes a catalytic triad composed of Ser-87, Asp-216 and His-244. 4 The catalytic amino acid order is the same as the order of enzymes that are part of the α/β hydrolase family. Thus polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase may be a novel member of the α/β hydrolase group. 5  Broader significance  This enzyme is a part of the pathway of indole alkaloid biosynthesis. The indole alkaloids that result from this metabolic pathway are used by many plant species as a defense against herbivores and parasites.  Open questions  The precise mechanisms by which this enzyme performs its function is still unknown. As noted above, researchers are formulating suggestions as to how polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase catalyses the decomposition of polyneuridine-aldehyde, but a mechanism has not yet been affirmed with absolute certainty. Due to the lack of complete understanding of polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase's precise mechanism, this enzyme cannot be grouped into a family of enzymes. Based on mechanism theories, suggestions can be made as to how this enzyme should be categorized, and some parallels can be drawn between polyneuridine-aldehyde esterase and other enzymes.
