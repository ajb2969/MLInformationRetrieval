   Liouvillian function      Liouvillian function   In mathematics, a Liouvillian function is an elementary function or (recursively) the integral of a Liouvillian function.  More explicitly, it is a function of one variable which is the composition of a finite number of arithmetic operations , exponentials , constants , solutions of algebraic equations (a generalization of n th roots ), and antiderivatives . The logarithm function does not need to be explicitly included since it is the integral of    1  /  x      1  x    1/x   .  It follows directly from the definition that the set of Liouvillian functions is closed under arithmetic operations, composition, and integration. It is also closed under differentiation . It not closed under limits and infinite sums .  Liouvillian functions were introduced by Joseph Liouville in a series of papers from 1833 to 1841.  Examples  All elementary functions are Liouvillian.  Examples of well-known functions which are Liouvillian but not elementary are:   The error function ,      erf   (  x  )    =    2   π      ∫  0  x      e   -   t  2      d  t      ,        erf  x       2    π      superscript   subscript   0   x      superscript  e     superscript  t  2     d  t       \mathrm{erf}(x)=\frac{2}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{x}e^{-t^{2}}\,dt,     The exponential ( Ei ) and logarithmic ( Li or li ) integrals.   All Liouvillian functions are solutions of algebraic differential equations , but not conversely. Examples of functions which are solutions of algebraic differential equations but not Liouvillian include: 1   the Bessel functions (except special cases);  the hypergeometric functions (except special cases).   Examples of functions which are not solutions of algebraic differential equations and thus not Liouvillian include all transcendentally transcendental functions , such as:   the gamma function ;  the zeta function .
