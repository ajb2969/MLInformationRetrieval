   Lie group action      Lie group action   In differential geometry, a Lie group action on a manifold M is a group action by a Lie group  G on M that is a differentiable map ; in particular, it is a continuous group action . Together with a Lie group action by G , M is called a G -manifold . The orbit types of G form a stratification of M and this can be used to understand the geometry of M .  Let    σ  :     G  ×  M   →  M   ,    (  g  ,  x  )   →   g  ⋅  x        normal-:  σ   formulae-sequence   normal-→    G  M   M    normal-→   g  x    normal-⋅  g  x       \sigma:G\times M\to M,(g,x)\to g\cdot x   be a group action. It is a Lie group action if it is differentiable. Thus, in particular, the orbit map     σ  x   :   G  →   M  ,   g  ⋅  x        normal-:   subscript  σ  x    normal-→  G   M   normal-⋅  g  x       \sigma_{x}:G\to M,g\cdot x   is differentiable and one can compute its differential at the identity element of G :      𝔤  →    T  x   M      normal-→  𝔤     subscript  T  x   M     \mathfrak{g}\to T_{x}M   . If X is in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , then its image under the above is a tangent vector at x and, varying x , one obtains a vector field on M ; the minus of this vector field is called the fundamental vector field associated with X and is denoted by    X  #     superscript  X  normal-#    X^{\#}   . (The "minus" ensures that    𝔤  →   Γ   (   T  M   )       normal-→  𝔤    normal-Γ    T  M      \mathfrak{g}\to\Gamma(TM)   is a Lie algebra homomorphism.) The kernel of the map can be easily shown (cf. Lie correspondence ) to be the Lie algebra    𝔤  x     subscript  𝔤  x    \mathfrak{g}_{x}   of the stabilizer    G  x     subscript  G  x    G_{x}   (which is closed and thus a Lie subgroup of G .)  Let    P  →  M     normal-→  P  M    P\to M   be a principal G -bundle. Since G has trivial stabilizers in P , for u in P ,     a  ↦   a  u  #    :   𝔤  →    T  u   P       normal-:   maps-to  a   subscript   superscript  a  normal-#   u     normal-→  𝔤     subscript  T  u   P      a\mapsto a^{\#}_{u}:\mathfrak{g}\to T_{u}P   is an isomorphism onto a subspace; this subspace is called the vertical subspace . A fundamental vector field on P is thus vertical .  In general, the orbit space     M  /  G      M  G    M/G   does not admit a manifold structure since, for example, it may not be Hausdorff. However, if G is compact, then    M  /  G      M  G    M/G   is Hausdorff and if, moreover, the action is free, then    M  /  G      M  G    M/G   is a manifold (in fact,    M  →   M  /  G      normal-→  M    M  G     M\to M/G   is a principal G -bundle.) 1 This is a consequence of the slice theorem . If the "free action" is relaxed to "finite stabilizer", one instead obtains an orbifold (or quotient stack .)  A substitute for the construction of the quotient is the Borel construction from algebraic topology: assume G is compact and let    E  G      E  G    EG   denote the universal bundle, which we can assume to be a manifold since G is compact, and let G act on     E  G   ×  M        E  G   M    EG\times M   diagonally; the action is free since it is so on the first factor. Thus, one can form the quotient manifold      M  G   =    (    E  G   ×  M   )   /  G        subscript  M  G         E  G   M   G     M_{G}=(EG\times M)/G   . The constriction in particular allows one to define the equivariant cohomology of M ; namely, one sets        H  G  *    (  M  )    =    H  dr  *    (   M  G   )           subscript   superscript  H    G   M      subscript   superscript  H    dr    subscript  M  G      H^{*}_{G}(M)=H^{*}_{\text{dr}}(M_{G})   , where the right-hand side denotes the de Rham cohomology, which makes sense since    M  G     subscript  M  G    M_{G}   has a structure of manifold (thus there is the notion of differential forms.)  If G is compact, then any G -manifold admits an invariant metric; i.e., a Riemannian metric with respect to which G acts on M as isometries.
