4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a 4-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-hydroxybenzoate 
 
 
 
  phenol + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4-hydroxybenzoate, and two products, phenol and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase (phenol-forming). Other names in common use include p-hydroxybenzoate decarboxylase, and 4-hydroxybenzoate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation.
