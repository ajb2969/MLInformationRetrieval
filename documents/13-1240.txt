Marchenko–Pastur distribution

In random matrix theory, the Marchenko–Pastur distribution, or Marchenko–Pastur law, describes the asymptotic behavior of singular values of large rectangular random matrices. The theorem is named after Ukrainian mathematicians Vladimir Marchenko and Leonid Pastur who proved this result in 1967.

The Marchenko–Pastur law also arises as the free Poisson law in free probability theory, having rate
