N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase




N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase

In enzymology, a N-acetylglucosamine-6-phosphate deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucosamine 6-phosphate + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucosamine 6-phosphate and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acetyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include acetylglucosamine phosphate deacetylase, acetylaminodeoxyglucosephosphate acetylhydrolase, and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-glucose-6-phosphate amidohydrolase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
