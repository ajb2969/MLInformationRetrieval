   Quaternion algebra      Quaternion algebra   In mathematics , a quaternion algebra over a field F is a central simple algebra  A over F 1 2 that has dimension 4 over F . Every quaternion algebra becomes the matrix algebra by extending scalars (= tensoring with a field extension), i.e. for a suitable field extension  K of F ,    A   ⊗  F   K      subscript  tensor-product  F   A  K    A\otimes_{F}K   is isomorphic to the 2×2 matrix algebra over K .  The notion of a quaternion algebra can be seen as a generalization of the Hamilton quaternions to an arbitrary base field. The Hamilton quaternions are a quaternion algebra (in the above sense) over    F  =  ℝ      F  ℝ    F=\mathbb{R}   (the real number field ), and indeed the only one over   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   apart from the 2×2 real matrix algebra, up to isomorphism .  Structure  Quaternion algebra here means something more general than the algebra of Hamilton quaternions . When the coefficient field F does not have characteristic 2, every quaternion algebra over F can be described as a 4-dimensional F -vector space with basis    {  1  ,  i  ,  j  ,  k  }     1  i  j  k    \{1,i,j,k\}   , with the following multiplication rules:       i  2   =  a       superscript  i  2   a    i^{2}=a          j  2   =  b       superscript  j  2   b    j^{2}=b          i  j   =  k        i  j   k    ij=k          j  i   =   -  k         j  i     k     ji=-k     where a and b are any given nonzero elements of F . From these rules we get:       k  2   =   i  j  i  j   =   -   i  i  j  j    =   -   a  b           superscript  k  2     i  j  i  j            i  i  j  j             a  b       k^{2}=ijij=-iijj=-ab     The classical instances where    F  =  ℝ      F  ℝ    F=\mathbb{R}   are Hamilton quaternions ( a = b = −1) and split-quaternions ( a = −1, b = +1).  The algebra defined in this way is denoted ( a , b ) F or simply ( a , b ). 3 When F has characteristic 2, a different explicit description in terms of a basis of 4 elements is also possible, but in any event the definition of a quaternion algebra over F as a 4-dimensional central simple algebra over F applies uniformly in all characteristics.  A quaternion algebra ( a , b ) F is either a division algebra or isomorphic to the matrix algebra of 2×2 matrices over F : the latter case is termed split . 4 The norm form       N   (   t  +   x  i   +   y  j   +   z  k    )    =     t  2   -   a   x  2    -   b   y  2     +   a  b   z  2           N    t    x  i     y  j     z  k          superscript  t  2     a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2       a  b   superscript  z  2       N(t+xi+yj+zk)=t^{2}-ax^{2}-by^{2}+abz^{2}   defines a structure of division algebra if and only if the norm is an anisotropic quadratic form , that is, zero only on the zero element. The conic C ( a , b ) defined by        a   x  2    +   b   y  2     =   z  2           a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2      superscript  z  2     ax^{2}+by^{2}=z^{2}   has a point ( x , y , z ) with coordinates in F in the split case. 5  Application  Quaternion algebras are applied in number theory , particularly to quadratic forms . They are concrete structures that generate the elements of order two in the Brauer group of F . For some fields, including algebraic number fields, every element of order 2 in its Brauer group is represented by a quaternion algebra. A theorem of Alexander Merkurjev implies that each element of order 2 in the Brauer group of any field is represented by a tensor product of quaternion algebras. 6 In particular, over p-adic fields the construction of quaternion algebras can be viewed as the quadratic Hilbert symbol of local class field theory .  Classification  It is a theorem of Frobenius that there are only two real quaternion algebras: 2×2 matrices over the reals and Hamilton's real quaternions.  In a similar way, over any local field  F there are exactly two quaternion algebras: the 2×2 matrices over F and a division algebra. But the quaternion division algebra over a local field is usually not Hamilton's quaternions over the field. For example, over the p -adic numbers Hamilton's quaternions are a division algebra only when p is 2. For odd prime p , the p -adic Hamilton quaternions are isomorphic to the 2×2 matrices over the p -adics. To see the p -adic Hamilton quaternions are not a division algebra for odd prime p , observe that the congruence x 2 + y 2 = −1 mod p is solvable and therefore by Hensel's lemma — here is where p being odd is needed — the equation   x 2 + y 2 = −1   is solvable in the p -adic numbers. Therefore the quaternion   xi + yj + k    has norm 0 and hence doesn't have a multiplicative inverse.  One would like to classify the F -algebra isomorphism  classes of all quaternion algebras for a given field, F . One way to do this is to use the one-to-one correspondence between isomorphism classes of quaternion algebras over F and isomorphism classes of their norm forms .  To every quaternion algebra A , one can associate a quadratic form N (called the norm form ) on A such that       N   (   x  y   )    =   N   (  x  )   N   (  y  )          N    x  y      N  x  N  y     N(xy)=N(x)N(y)     for all x and y in A . It turns out that the possible norm forms for quaternion F -algebras are exactly the Pfister 2-forms .  Quaternion algebras over the rational numbers  Quaternion algebras over the rational numbers have an arithmetic theory similar to, but more complicated than, that of quadratic extensions of   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   .  Let   B   B   B   be a quaternion algebra over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   and let   ν   ν   \nu   be a place of   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , with completion    ℚ  ν     subscript  ℚ  ν    \mathbb{Q}_{\nu}   (so it is either the p -adic numbers    ℚ  p     subscript  ℚ  p    \mathbb{Q}_{p}   for some prime p or the real numbers   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   ). Define     B  ν   :=    ℚ  ν    ⊗  ℚ   B      assign   subscript  B  ν     subscript  tensor-product  ℚ    subscript  ℚ  ν   B     B_{\nu}:=\mathbb{Q}_{\nu}\otimes_{\mathbb{Q}}B   , which is a quaternion algebra over    ℚ  ν     subscript  ℚ  ν    \mathbb{Q}_{\nu}   . So there are two choices for    B  ν     subscript  B  ν    B_{\nu}   : the 2 by 2 matrices over    ℚ  ν     subscript  ℚ  ν    \mathbb{Q}_{\nu}   or a division algebra.  We say that   B   B   B   is split (or unramified ) at   ν   ν   \nu   if    B  ν     subscript  B  ν    B_{\nu}   is isomorphic to the 2×2 matrices over    ℚ  ν     subscript  ℚ  ν    \mathbb{Q}_{\nu}   . We say that B is non-split (or ramified ) at   ν   ν   \nu   if    B  ν     subscript  B  ν    B_{\nu}   is the quaternion division algebra over    ℚ  ν     subscript  ℚ  ν    \mathbb{Q}_{\nu}   . For example, the rational Hamilton quaternions is non-split at 2 and at   ∞     \infty   and split at all odd primes. The rational 2 by 2 matrices are split at all places.  A quaternion algebra over the rationals which splits at   ∞     \infty   is analogous to a real quadratic field and one which is non-split at   ∞     \infty   is analogous to an imaginary quadratic field. The analogy comes from a quadratic field having real embeddings when the minimal polynomial for a generator splits over the reals and having non-real embeddings otherwise. One illustration of the strength of this analogy concerns unit groups in an order of a rational quaternion algebra: it is infinite if the quaternion algebra splits at   ∞     \infty   and it is finite otherwise, just as the unit group of an order in a quadratic ring is infinite in the real quadratic case and finite otherwise.  The number of places where a quaternion algebra over the rationals ramifies is always even, and this is equivalent to the quadratic reciprocity law over the rationals. Moreover, the places where B ramifies determines B up to isomorphism as an algebra. (In other words, non-isomorphic quaternion algebras over the rationals do not share the same set of ramified places.) The product of the primes at which B ramifies is called the discriminant of B .
