Bretherton equation

In mathematics, the Bretherton equation is a nonlinear partial differential equation introduced by Francis P. Bretherton in 1964:1



with 
 
 
integer and 
 
 
 
  While 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote partial derivatives of the scalar field


The original equation studied by Bretherton has quadratic nonlinearity, 
 
 
Nayfeh treats the case 
 
 
 
  with two different methods: Whitham's averaged Lagrangian method and the method of multiple scales.2
The Bretherton equation is a model equation for studying weakly-nonlinear wave dispersion. It has been used to study the interaction of harmonics by nonlinear resonance.34 Bretherton obtained analytic solutions in terms of Jacobi elliptic functions.56
Variational formulations
The Bretherton equation derives from the Lagrangian density:7



through the Euler–Lagrange equation:



The equation can also be formulated as a Hamiltonian system:8



in terms of functional derivatives involving the Hamiltonian 
 
 



 
   and  
 
 

with 
 
 
 
  the Hamiltonian density – consequently 
 
 
 
  The Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
  is the total energy of the system, and is conserved over time.910
