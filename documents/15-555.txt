Petersen matrix
The '''Petersen matrix''' is a comprehensive description of systems of [[biochemistry|biochemical reactions]] used to model [[
 chemical reactor|reactors]] for pollution control (engineered decomposition) as well as in environmental systems. It has got as many columns as the number of relevant involved components (chemicals, pollutants, biomasses, gases) and as many rows as the number of involved processes (biochemical reactions and physical degradation). One further column is added to host the description of the kinetics of each transformation (rate equation).12
Matrix structure
The mass conservation principle for each process is expressed in the rows of the matrix. If all components are included (none omitted) then the mass conservation principle states that, for each process:



where 
 
 
 
  is the density rate of each component. This can also be seen as the process stoichiometric relation.
Moreover, the rate of variation of each component for all processes simultaneous effect can be easily assessed by summing the columns:



where 
 
 
 
  are the reaction rates of each process.
Example
A system of a second order reaction followed by a Michaelis-Menten enzyme reaction.




where the reagents A and B combine forming the substrate S, which with the help of enzyme E is transformed into the product P.
