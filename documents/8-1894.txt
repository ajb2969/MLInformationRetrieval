   Imaginary point      Imaginary point   In geometry , in the context of a real geometric space extended to (or embedded in) a complex projective space , an imaginary point is a point not contained in the embedded space.  Definition  In terms of homogeneous coordinates , a point of the complex projective plane with coordinates ( a , b , c ) in the complex projective space for which there exists no complex number  z such that za , zb , and zc are all real .  This definition generalizes to complex projective spaces. The point with coordinates      (   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  n   )      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  n     (a_{1},a_{2},\ldots,a_{n})     is imaginary if there exists no complex number z such that      (   z   a  1    ,   z   a  2    ,  …  ,   z   a  n    )       z   subscript  a  1      z   subscript  a  2    normal-…    z   subscript  a  n      (za_{1},za_{2},\ldots,za_{n})     are all real coordinates. 1  Properties  Every imaginary point belongs to exactly one real line, the line through the point and its complex conjugate . 2  See also   Real point   References  "  Category:Projective geometry     . ↩
