   Green's function number      Green's function number   In mathematical heat conduction , the Green's function number is used to uniquely categorize certain fundamental solutions of the heat equation to make existing solutions easier to identify, store, and retrieve.  Background  Numbers have long been used to identify types of boundary conditions. 1 2 3 The Green's function number system was proposed by Beck and Litkouhi in 1988 4 and has seen increasing use since then. 5 6 7 8 The number system has been used to catalog a large collection of Green’s functions. 9  Although described here for solutions of the heat equation, this number system could also be used for any phenomena described by differential equations such as diffusion , acoustics , electromagnetics , fluid dynamics , etc.  Notation  The Green's function number specifies the coordinate system and the type of boundary conditions that a Green's function satisfies. The Green's function number has two parts, a letter designation followed by a number designation. The letter(s) designate the coordinate system while the numbers designate the type of boundary conditions that are satisfied.      Table 1. Boundary conditions designations for Green's function number system.     Name     No physical boundary     Dirichlet     Neumann     Robin     Some of the designations for the Greens function number system are given next. Coordinate system designations include: X, Y, and Z for Cartesian coordinates; R, Z,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   for cylindrical coordinates; and, RS,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ,   θ   θ   \theta   for spherical coordinates. Designations for several boundary conditions are given in Table 1. The zeroth boundary condition is important for identifying the presence of a coordinate boundary where no physical boundary exists, for example, far away in a semi-infinite body or at the center of a cylindrical or spherical body.  Examples in Cartesian coordinates  X11  As an example, number X11 denotes the Green's function that satisfies the heat equation in the domain (0  \begin{align} \dfrac{\partial^2 G}{\partial x^2} +\dfrac{1}{\alpha} \delta(t - \tau) \delta(x - x')  = \dfrac{1}{\alpha} \dfrac{\partial G}{\partial t}; &\;\; 0 0      \\  G |_{x=0}=0; \;\; G |_{x=L}=0; \;\; G |_{t Here   α   α   \alpha   is thermal diffusivity (m 2 /s) and   δ   δ   \delta   is the Dirac delta function .  X20  As another Cartesian example, number X20 denotes the Green's function in the semi-infinite body (          ∂  2   G    ∂   x  2      +     1  α    δ   (   t  -  τ   )   δ   (   x  -   x  ′    )     =     1  α       ∂  G    ∂  t       ;            superscript   2   G      superscript  x  2         1  α   δ    t  τ   δ    x   superscript  x  normal-′          1  α       G     t       \displaystyle\dfrac{\partial^{2}G}{\partial x^{2}}+\dfrac{1}{\alpha}\delta(t-%

The boundary value problem for the X20 Green's function is given by            G  |    r  =  0    is bounded   ;      k    ∂  G    ∂  n     |    r  =  a    +     h  G   |    r  =  a      =  0   ;     G  |    t  <  τ    =  0    ;     formulae-sequence        evaluated-at  G    r  0    is bounded      evaluated-at    k      G     n       r  a     evaluated-at    h  G     r  a      0      evaluated-at  G    t  τ    0     G|_{r=0}\mbox{ is bounded};\;\;k\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial n}|_{r=a}+hG|_{r=a%

R10  As another example, number R10 denotes the Green’s function in a large body containing a cylindrical void (a  \infty ) with a type 1 (Dirichlet) boundary condition at r = a. Again letter R denotes the cylindrical coordinate system, number 1 denotes the type 1 boundary at r = a, and number 0 denotes the type zero boundary (boundedness) at large values of r. The boundary value problem for the R10 Green’s function is given by            G  |    r  =  0    is bounded   ;      ∂  G    ∂  n    |    r  =  b     =  0   ;     G  |    t  <  τ    =  0    ;     formulae-sequence        evaluated-at  G    r  0    is bounded    evaluated-at      G     n      r  b     0      evaluated-at  G    t  τ    0     G|_{r=0}\mbox{ is bounded};\;\;\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial n}|_{r=b}=0;\;\;G|_%
