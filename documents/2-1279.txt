List of integrals of inverse hyperbolic functions

The following is a list of indefinite integrals (antiderivatives) of expressions involving the inverse hyperbolic functions. For a complete list of integral formulas, see lists of integrals.

In all formulas the constant a is assumed to be nonzero, and C denotes the constant of integration.
For each inverse hyperbolic integration formula below there is a corresponding formula in the list of integrals of inverse trigonometric functions.
