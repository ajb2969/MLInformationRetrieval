   Acetyl-CoA C-myristoyltransferase      Acetyl-CoA C-myristoyltransferase   In enzymology , an acetyl-CoA C-myristoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   myristoyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA + CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are myristoyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA , whereas its two products are 3-oxopalmitoyl-CoA and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is myristoyl-CoA:acetyl-CoA C-myristoyltransferase .  References     External links     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
