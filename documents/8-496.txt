   Quasi-open map      Quasi-open map   In topology a branch of mathematics, a quasi-open map or quasi-interior map is a function which has similar properties to continuous maps . However, continuous maps and quasi-open maps are not related. 1  Definition  A function    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   between topological spaces    X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   is quasi-open if, for any non-empty open set     U  ⊂  X      U  X    U\subset X   , the interior of    f   (  U  )       f  U    f(U)   in   Y   Y   Y   is non-empty. 2 3  Properties  Let    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be a function such that X and Y are topological spaces.   If   f   f   f   is continuous, it need not be quasi-open. Conversely if   f   f   f   is quasi-open, it need not be continuous. 4  If   f   f   f   is open , then   f   f   f   is quasi-open. 5  If   f   f   f   is a local homeomorphism , then   f   f   f   is quasi-open. 6  If    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   and    g  :   Y  →  Z      normal-:  g   normal-→  Y  Z     g:Y\to Z   are both quasi-open (such that all spaces are topological), then the function composition     h  =   g  ∘  f    :   X  →  Z      normal-:    h    g  f     normal-→  X  Z     h=g\circ f:X\to Z   is quasi-open. 7   References  "  Category:Topology      ↩  ↩
