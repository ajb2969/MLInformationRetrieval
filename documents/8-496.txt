Quasi-open map

In topology a branch of mathematics, a quasi-open map or quasi-interior map is a function which has similar properties to continuous maps. However, continuous maps and quasi-open maps are not related.1
Definition
A function 
 
 
 
  between topological spaces

 
  and 
 
 
 
  is quasi-open if, for any non-empty open set

 
 
 , the interior of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is non-empty.23
Properties
Let 
 
 
 
  be a function such that X and Y are topological spaces.

If 
 
 
 
  is continuous, it need not be quasi-open. Conversely if 
 
 
 
 
  is quasi-open, it need not be continuous.4
If 
 
 
 
  is open, then 
 
 
 
  is quasi-open.5
If 
 
 
 
  is a local homeomorphism, then 
 
 
 
  is quasi-open.6
If 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are both quasi-open (such that all spaces are topological), then the function composition 
 
 
 
  is quasi-open.7
