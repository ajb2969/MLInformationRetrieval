Admissible trading strategy

In finance, an admissible trading strategy or admissible strategy is any trading strategy with wealth almost surely bounded from below. In particular, an admissible trading strategy procludes unhedged short sales of any unbounded assets.1 A typical example of a trading strategy which is not admissible is the doubling strategy.2
Mathematical definition
In a market with 
 
 
 
  assets, a trading strategy 
 
 
 
  is admissible if 
 
 
 
  is almost surely bounded from below. In the definition let 
 
 
 
  be the vector of prices, 
 
 
 
  be the risk-free rate (and therefore 
 
 
 
  is the discounted price).3
In a model with more than one time then the wealth process associated with an admissible trading strategy must be uniformly bounded from below.4
