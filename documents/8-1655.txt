   E-function      E-function   In mathematics , E-functions are a type of power series that satisfy particular arithmetic conditions on the coefficients. They are of interest in transcendence theory , and are more special than G-functions .  Definition  A function f ( x ) is called of type E , or an E -function , 1 if the power series       f   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     c  n     x  n    n  !            f  x     superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  c  n      superscript  x  n     n        f(x)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_{n}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}     satisfies the following three conditions:   All the coefficients c n belong to the same algebraic number field , K , which has finite degree over the rational numbers;  For all ε > 0,         |   c  n   |   ¯   =   O   (   n   n  ε    )         normal-¯     subscript  c  n       O   superscript  n    n  ε       \overline{\left|c_{n}\right|}=O\left(n^{n\varepsilon}\right)   , where the left hand side represents the maximum of the absolute values of all the algebraic conjugates of c n ;   For all ε > 0 there is a sequence of natural numbers q 0 , q 1 , q 2 ,… such that ''q n c k'' is an algebraic integer in K for k =0, 1, 2,…, n , and n = 0, 1, 2,… and for which        q  n   =   O   (   n   n  ε    )         subscript  q  n     O   superscript  n    n  ε       q_{n}=O\left(n^{n\varepsilon}\right)   .  The second condition implies that f is an entire function of x .  Uses  E -functions were first studied by Siegel in 1929. 2 He found a method to show that the values taken by certain E -functions were algebraically independent .This was a result which established the algebraic independence of classes of numbers rather than just linear independence. 3 Since then these functions have proved somewhat useful in number theory and in particular they have application in transcendence proofs and differential equations . 4  The Siegel–Shidlovsky theorem  Perhaps the main result connected to E -functions is the Siegel–Shidlovsky theorem (also known as the Shidlovsky and Shidlovskii theorem), named after Carl Ludwig Siegel and Andrei Borisovich Shidlovskii.  Suppose that we are given n  E -functions, E 1 ( x ),…, E n ( x ), that satisfy a system of homogeneous linear differential equations       y  i  ′   =   ∑   j  =  1   n    f   i  j     (  x  )    y  j    (  1  ≤  i  ≤  n  )      fragments   subscript   superscript  y  normal-′   i     superscript   subscript     j  1    n    subscript  f    i  j     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    subscript  y  j     fragments  normal-(  1   i   n  normal-)     y^{\prime}_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}f_{ij}(x)y_{j}\quad(1\leq i\leq n)   where the f ij are rational functions of x , and the coefficients of each E and f are elements of an algebraic number field K . Then the theorem states that if E 1 ( x ),…, E n ( x ) are algebraically independent over K ( x ), then for any non-zero algebraic number α that is not a pole of any of the f ij the numbers E 1 (α),…, E n (α) are algebraically independent.  Examples   Any polynomial with algebraic coefficients is a simple example of an E -function.  The exponential function is an E -function, in its case c n =1 for all of the n .  If λ is an algebraic number then the Bessel function  J λ is an E -function.  The sum or product of two E -functions is an E -function. In particular E -functions form a ring .  If a is an algebraic number and f ( x ) is an E -function then f ( ax ) will be an E -function.  If f ( x ) is an E -function then the derivative and integral of f are also E -functions.
