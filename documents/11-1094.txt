Histidinol-phosphate transaminase

In enzymology, a histidinol-phosphate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-histidinol phosphate + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  3-(imidazol-4-yl)-2-oxopropyl phosphate + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-histidinol phosphate and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are 3-(imidazol-4-yl)-2-oxopropyl phosphate and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-histidinol-phosphate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include imidazolylacetolphosphate transaminase, glutamic-imidazoleacetol phosphate transaminase, histidinol phosphate aminotransferase, imidazoleacetol phosphate transaminase, L-histidinol phosphate aminotransferase, histidine:imidazoleacetol phosphate transaminase, IAP transaminase, and imidazolylacetolphosphate aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways: histidine metabolism, tyrosine metabolism, phenylalanine metabolism, phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis, and novobiocin biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
