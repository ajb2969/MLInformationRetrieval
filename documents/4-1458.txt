   Cut rule      Cut rule   In mathematical logic , the cut rule is an inference rule of sequent calculus . It is a generalisation of the classical modus ponens inference rule. Its meaning is that, if a formula A appears as a conclusion in one proof and an hypothesis in another, then another proof in which the formula A does not appear can be deduced. In the particular case of the modus ponens, for example occurrences of man are eliminated of Every man is mortal, Socrates is a man to deduce Socrates is mortal .  Formal notation  Formal notation in sequent calculus notation :   cut:     \cfrac{\Gamma \vdash A, \Delta \qquad \Gamma', A \vdash \Delta'} {\Gamma, \Gamma' \vdash \Delta, \Delta'}  Elimination  The cut rule is the subject of an important theorem, the cut elimination theorem . It states that any judgement that possesses a proof in the sequent calculus that makes use of the cut rule also possesses a cut-free proof, that is, a proof that does not make use of the cut rule.
