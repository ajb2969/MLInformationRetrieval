   Analytic semigroup      Analytic semigroup   In mathematics , an analytic semigroup is particular kind of strongly continuous semigroup . Analytic semigroups are used in the solution of partial differential equations ; compared to strongly continuous semigroups, analytic semigroups provide better regularity of solutions to initial value problems , better results concerning perturbations of the infinitesimal generator , and a relationship between the type of the semigroup and the spectrum of the infinitesimal generator.  Definition  Let Γ( t ) = exp( At ) be a strongly continuous one-parameter semigroup on a Banach space ( X , ||·||) with infinitesimal generator A . Γ is said to be an analytic semigroup if   for some 0 θ ,           Δ  θ   =    {  0  }   ∪   {   t  ∈  ℂ   :    |   arg   (  t  )    |   <  θ   }     ,       subscript  normal-Δ  θ      0    conditional-set    t  ℂ         arg  t    θ       \Delta_{\theta}=\{0\}\cup\{t\in\mathbb{C}:|\mathrm{arg}(t)|<\theta\},         and the usual semigroup conditions hold for s , t ∈ Δ θ : exp( A 0) = id, exp( A ( t + s )) = exp( At )exp( As ), and, for each x ∈ X , exp( At ) x is continuous in t ;    and, for all t ∈ Δ θ \ {0}, exp( At ) is analytic in t in the sense of the uniform operator topology .   Characterization  The infinitesimal generators of analytic semigroups have the following characterization:  A closed , densely defined  linear operator  A on a Banach space X is the generator of an analytic semigroup if and only if there exists an ω ∈ R such that the half-plane Re( λ ) > ω is contained in the resolvent set of A and, moreover, there is a constant C such that       ∥    R  λ    (  A  )    ∥   ≤   C   |   λ  -  ω   |         norm     subscript  R  λ   A      C      λ  ω       \|R_{\lambda}(A)\|\leq\frac{C}{|\lambda-\omega|}     for Re( λ ) > ω and where     R  λ    (  A  )        subscript  R  λ   A    R_{\lambda}(A)   is the resolvent of the operator A . Such operators are called sectorial . If this is the case, then the resolvent set actually contains a sector of the form      {   λ  ∈  𝐂   :    |   arg   (   λ  -  ω   )    |   <    π  2   +  δ    }     conditional-set    λ  𝐂         arg    λ  ω         π  2   δ      \left\{\lambda\in\mathbf{C}:|\mathrm{arg}(\lambda-\omega)|<\frac{\pi}{2}+%
 \delta\right\}     for some δ > 0, and an analogous resolvent estimate holds in this sector. Moreover, the semigroup is represented by        exp   (   A  t   )    =    1   2  π  i      ∫  γ     e   λ  t       (    λ  id   -  A   )    -  1     d  λ      ,          A  t        1    2  π  i      subscript   γ      superscript  e    λ  t     superscript      λ  id   A     1    normal-d  λ       \exp(At)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\gamma}e^{\lambda t}(\lambda\mathrm{id}-A)^{-1}%
 \,\mathrm{d}\lambda,     where γ is any curve from e − iθ ∞ to e + iθ ∞ such that γ lies entirely in the sector       {   λ  ∈  𝐂   :    |   arg   (   λ  -  ω   )    |   ≤  θ   }   ,     conditional-set    λ  𝐂         arg    λ  ω     θ     \big\{\lambda\in\mathbf{C}:|\mathrm{arg}(\lambda-\omega)|\leq\theta\big\},     with π ⁄ 2
