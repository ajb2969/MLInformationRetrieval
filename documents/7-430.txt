   Shift rule      Shift rule   The shift rule is a mathematical rule for sequences and series .  For sequences it states, if    (   a  n   )     subscript  a  n    (a_{n})   is a sequences then it converges if and only if    (   a   n  +  N    )     subscript  a    n  N     (a_{n+N})   also converges, and in this case both sequences always converge to the same number. 1  For series it states, the series     Σ   n  =  1   ∞    (   a  n   )        subscript   superscript  normal-Σ      n  1     subscript  a  n     {\Sigma^{\infty}_{n=1}}(a_{n})   converges to a number if and only if     Σ   n  =  1   ∞    (   a   n  +  N    )        subscript   superscript  normal-Σ      n  1     subscript  a    n  N      {\Sigma^{\infty}_{n=1}}(a_{n+N})   converges. 2  References  "  Category:Sequences and series     . ↩  . ↩
