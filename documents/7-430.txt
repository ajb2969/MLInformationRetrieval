Shift rule

The shift rule is a mathematical rule for sequences and series.
For sequences it states, if 
 
 
 
  is a sequences then it converges if and only if 
 
 
 
  also converges, and in this case both sequences always converge to the same number.1
For series it states, the series 
 
 
 
  converges to a number if and only if 
 
 
 
  converges.2
