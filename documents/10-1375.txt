   Apo-beta-carotenoid-14',13'-dioxygenase      Apo-beta-carotenoid-14',13'-dioxygenase   Apo-beta-carotenoid-14',13'-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   8'-apo-beta-carotenol + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   14'-apo-beta-carotenal + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 8'-apo-beta-carotenol and oxygen , whereas its two products are 14'-apo-beta-carotenal and water .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O with incorporation of one atom of oxygen (internal monooxygenases o internal mixed-function oxidases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is 8'-apo-beta-carotenol:O2 oxidoreductase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.13.12  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
