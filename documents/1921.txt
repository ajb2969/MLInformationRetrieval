   3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA lyase      3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA lyase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   7-methyl-3-oxooct-6-enoyl-CoA + acetate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA , and two products , 7-methyl-3-oxooct-6-enoyl-CoA and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA acetate-lyase (7-methyl-3-oxooct-6-enoyl-CoA-forming) . Other names in common use include beta-hydroxy-beta-isohexenylglutaryl CoA-lyase , hydroxyisohexenylglutaryl-CoA:acetatelyase , 3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl coenzyme A lyase , 3-hydroxy-3-isohexenylglutaryl-CoA isopentenylacetoacetyl-CoA-lyase , and 3-hydroxy-3-(4-methylpent-3-en-1-yl)glutaryl-CoA acetate-lyase .
