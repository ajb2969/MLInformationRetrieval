Lanczos tensor
{{*mp}}... that the Lanczos tensor of general relativity exists only in four dimensions, suggesting our universe of four spacetime dimensions is special?

:*Comment: It's a little math-heavy but of the same mid-importance in physics as electromagnetic four-potential. Created/expanded by Teply (talk). Self nom at 10:06, 12 October 2012 (UTC)
:* I'm reviewing this with the proviso that to a non-physicist like me the article might as well be written in Swahili, so I'm necessarily assuming good faith on its accuracy. Length and date are fine. It's decently written but perhaps a little lightly sourced in a few places (the sources that are used all look fine); in particular I would suggest adding a reference to the end of the para that begins "where 
 
 
 
  is the d'Alembert operator." Prioryman (talk) 07:43, 16 October 2012 (UTC)
::*I hope the recent edits alleviate your concerns. It's a somewhat advanced topic, difficult for beginning physicists, too. My hope is that the "four spacetime dimensions is special" portion of the hook will have wider appeal. Thank you for your patience. Teply (talk) 07:23, 18 October 2012 (UTC)
:::* Yep, good work - well done. I think we're good to go now. Prioryman (talk) 00:07, 26 October 2012 (UTC)
