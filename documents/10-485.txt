   D-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase      D-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a D-arabinitol 4-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-arabinitol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-xylulose + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-arabinitol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are D-xylulose , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-arabinitol:NAD + 4-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include D-arabitol dehydrogenase and arabitol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and fructose and mannose metabolism .  References   Characterization of Arabitol Dehyrogenase in Transplastomic Plants.
