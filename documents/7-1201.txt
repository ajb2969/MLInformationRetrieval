   Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation      Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation   In mathematics and physics , the Kadomtsev–Petviashvili equation – or KP equation , named after Boris Borisovich Kadomtsev and Vladimir Iosifovich Petviashvili – is a partial differential equation to describe nonlinear  wave motion . The KP equation is usually written as:         ∂  x    (     ∂  t   u   +   u    ∂  x   u    +    ϵ  2     ∂   x  x  x    u     )    +   λ    ∂   y  y    u     =  0          subscript   x       subscript   t   u     u    subscript   x   u       superscript  ϵ  2     subscript     x  x  x    u        λ    subscript     y  y    u     0    \displaystyle\partial_{x}(\partial_{t}u+u\partial_{x}u+\epsilon^{2}\partial_{%
 xxx}u)+\lambda\partial_{yy}u=0   where    λ  =   ±  1       λ   plus-or-minus  1     \lambda=\pm 1   . The above form shows that the KP equation is a generalization to two spatial dimensions , x and y , of the one-dimensional Korteweg–de Vries (KdV) equation . To be physically meaningful, the wave propagation direction has to be not-too-far from the x direction, i.e. with only slow variations of solutions in the y direction.  Like the KdV equation, the KP equation is completely integrable. It can also be solved using the inverse scattering transform much like the nonlinear Schrödinger equation .  History  The KP equation was first written in 1970 by Soviet physicists Boris B. Kadomtsev (1928–1998) and Vladimir I. Petviashvili (1936–1993); it came as a natural generalization of the KdV equation (derived by Korteweg and De Vries in 1895). Whereas in the KdV equation waves are strictly one-dimensional, in the KP equation this restriction is relaxed. Still, both in the KdV and the KP equation, waves have to travel in the positive x -direction.  Connections to physics  The KP equation can be used to model water waves of long wavelength with weakly non-linear restoring forces and frequency dispersion . If surface tension is weak compared to gravitational forces ,    λ  =   +  1       λ    1     \lambda=+1   is used; if surface tension is strong, then    λ  =   -  1       λ    1     \lambda=-1   . Because of the asymmetry in the way x - and y -terms enter the equation, the waves described by the KP equation behave differently in the direction of propagation ( x -direction) and transverse ( y ) direction; oscillations in the y -direction tend to be smoother (be of small-deviation).  The KP equation can also be used to model waves in ferromagnetic media, as well as two-dimensional matter–wave pulses in Bose–Einstein condensates .  Limiting behavior  For    ϵ  ≪  1     much-less-than  ϵ  1    \epsilon\ll 1   , typical x -dependent oscillations have a wavelength of    O   (   1  /  ϵ   )       O    1  ϵ     O(1/\epsilon)   giving a singular limiting regime as    ϵ  →  0     normal-→  ϵ  0    \epsilon\rightarrow 0   . The limit    ϵ  →  0     normal-→  ϵ  0    \epsilon\rightarrow 0   is called the dispersionless limit.  If we also assume that the solutions are independent of y as    ϵ  →  0     normal-→  ϵ  0    \epsilon\rightarrow 0   , then they also satisfy Burgers' equation :         ∂  t   u   +   u    ∂  x   u     =  0.          subscript   t   u     u    subscript   x   u     0.    \displaystyle\partial_{t}u+u\partial_{x}u=0.     Suppose the amplitude of oscillations of a solution is asymptotically small —    O   (  ϵ  )       O  ϵ    O(\epsilon)   — in the dispersionless limit. Then the amplitude satisfies a mean-field equation of Davey–Stewartson type.  See also   Novikov–Veselov equation   References    .
