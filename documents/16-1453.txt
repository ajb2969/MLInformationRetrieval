   Draft:Finite field      Draft:Finite field   == Classification == This section gives proofs of some of the basic facts but it will assume a familiarity with ring theory.  Let F be a finite field. For any element x in F and any integer  n , let us denote by n ⋅ x the sum of n copies of x . There is an integer n such that n ⋅1; otherwise, the subset    {   n  ⋅  1   |   n  ≠  0   }     conditional-set   normal-⋅  n  1     n  0     \{n\cdot 1|n\neq 0\}   is infinite. Since n is a product of prime numbers and F is an integral domain (there is no zero divisor), this n must be a prime number p ; called the characteristic of the field F .  The identity         (   x  +  y   )   p   =    x  p   +   y  p         superscript    x  y   p      superscript  x  p    superscript  y  p      (x+y)^{p}=x^{p}+y^{p}      is true (for every   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   ) in a field of characteristic   p   p   p   . (This follows from the fact that all, except the first and the last, binomial coefficients of the expansion of     (   x  +  y   )   p     superscript    x  y   p    (x+y)^{p}   are multiples of   p   p   p   ).  Let    𝐅   p  m      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  m     \mathbf{F}_{p^{m}}   denote the set of all roots of the polynomials     X   p  m    -  X       superscript  X   superscript  p  m    X    X^{p^{m}}-X   in F . Then one can see    𝐅   p  m      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  m     \mathbf{F}_{p^{m}}   is a subfield of F of order    p  m     superscript  p  m    p^{m}   . (Proof: it contains 0, 1, -1 and is closed under multiplication. It is closed under addition since      (   x  +  y   )    p  m    =    x   p  m    +   y   p  m     =   x  +  y          superscript    x  y    superscript  p  m       superscript  x   superscript  p  m     superscript  y   superscript  p  m            x  y      (x+y)^{p^{m}}=x^{p^{m}}+y^{p^{m}}=x+y   . Finally,     X   p  m    -  X       superscript  X   superscript  p  m    X    X^{p^{m}}-X   and its derivative are relatively prime; i.e., the roots are distinct.)  In particular,    𝐅  p     subscript  𝐅  p    \mathbf{F}_{p}   is the smallest subfield that F contains. The ring homomorphism     ℤ  →  F   ,   n  ↦   n  ⋅  1       formulae-sequence   normal-→  ℤ  F    maps-to  n   normal-⋅  n  1      \mathbb{Z}\to F,\,n\mapsto n\cdot 1   induces the isomorphism ( first isomorphism theorem )        ℤ  /  p   ℤ   ≃   𝐅  p      similar-to-or-equals      ℤ  p   ℤ    subscript  𝐅  p     \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}\simeq\mathbf{F}_{p}   .  F is a vector space over    𝐅  p     subscript  𝐅  p    \mathbf{F}_{p}   of dimension n . It follows that F has order q = p n (and so    F  =   𝐅  q       F   subscript  𝐅  q     F=\mathbf{F}_{q}   .)  To get all finite fields of the characteristic p in a systematic way, we can repeat the above argument with an algebraically field    𝐅  p     subscript  𝐅  p    \mathbf{F}_{p}   of characteristic p (which exists; take for example the algebraic closure of the field     ℤ  /  p   ℤ        ℤ  p   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}   .) Then    𝐅   p  n      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  n     \mathbf{F}_{p^{n}}   are all subfields of     𝐅  p   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  𝐅  p     \overline{\mathbf{F}_{p}}   and, conversely,     𝐅  p   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  𝐅  p     \overline{\mathbf{F}_{p}}   is the union of    𝐅   p  n      subscript  𝐅   superscript  p  n     \mathbf{F}_{p^{n}}   for all n .  Galois group of finite fields  The Galois theory provides a systematic way of classifying and constructing finite fields.  Let F be a finite field. One can show F is a finite Galois extension (normal and separable) over    𝐅  p     subscript  𝐅  p    \mathbf{F}_{p}   , for example, from the explicit construction as above. Let G be the Galois group    Gal   (   F  /   𝔽  p    )      Gal    F   subscript  𝔽  p      \operatorname{Gal}(F/\mathbb{F}_{p})   ; i.e., it consists of all automorphisms from F to F that is the identity when restricted to     𝔽  p     subscript  𝔽  p    \mathbb{F}_{p}    . Then one can show G is generated by the Frobenius endomorphism    σ  :   x  ↦   x  p       normal-:  σ   maps-to  x   superscript  x  p      \sigma:x\mapsto x^{p}   , again for example from the previous explicit construction. In other words, there is a "canonical" group isomorphism:        Gal   (   F  /   𝔽  p    )    ≃    ℤ  /  n   ℤ    ,    σ  m   ↦  m      formulae-sequence   similar-to-or-equals   Gal    F   subscript  𝔽  p         ℤ  n   ℤ     maps-to   superscript  σ  m   m     \operatorname{Gal}(F/\mathbb{F}_{p})\simeq\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z},\,\sigma^{m}\mapsto
 m   when p n is the order of F .  Now the fundamental theorem of Galois theory says: there is an order-reversing bijection:      K  →  Gal   (  F  /  K  )   =   {  ϕ  :  F  →  F  |  ϕ   (  x  )   =  x  ,  x  ∈  K  }      fragments  K  normal-→  Gal   fragments  normal-(  F   K  normal-)     fragments  normal-{  ϕ  normal-:  F  normal-→  F  normal-|  ϕ   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    x  normal-,  x   K  normal-}     K\to\operatorname{Gal}(F/K)=\{\phi:F\to F|\phi(x)=x,x\in K\}   from the subfields K of F to the subgroups of G .  Let the order of F be . It follows: For each integer m dividing n , there is exactly one"
