   Uniformly hyperfinite algebra      Uniformly hyperfinite algebra   In mathematics , particularly in the theory of C*-algebras , a uniformly hyperfinite , or UHF , algebra is a C*-algebra that can be written as the closure, in the norm topology , of an increasing union of finite-dimensional full matrix algebras .  Definition and classification  A UHF C*-algebra is the direct limit of an inductive system { A n , φ n } where each A n is a finite-dimensional full matrix algebra and each φ n : A n → A n +1 is a unital embedding. Suppressing the connecting maps, one can write       A  =     ∪  n    A  n    ¯    .      A   normal-¯    subscript   n    subscript  A  n       A=\overline{\cup_{n}A_{n}}.     If        A  n   ≃    M   k  n     (  ℂ  )     ,     similar-to-or-equals   subscript  A  n      subscript  M   subscript  k  n    ℂ     A_{n}\simeq M_{k_{n}}(\mathbb{C}),     then r k n = ''k n'' + 1 for some integer r and         ϕ  n    (  a  )    =   a  ⊗   I  r     ,         subscript  ϕ  n   a    tensor-product  a   subscript  I  r      \phi_{n}(a)=a\otimes I_{r},     where I r is the identity in the r × r matrices. The sequence ... k n | k n'' + 1 | k n'' + 2 ... determines a formal product       δ   (  A  )    =    ∏  p    p   t  p           δ  A     subscript  product  p    superscript  p   subscript  t  p       \delta(A)=\prod_{p}p^{t_{p}}     where each p is prime and t p = sup { m | p m divides ''k n '' for some n }, possibly zero or infinite. The formal product δ ( A ) is said to be the supernatural number corresponding to A . 1  Glimm showed that the supernatural number is a complete invariant of UHF C*-algebras. 2 In particular, there are uncountably many isomorphism classes of UHF C*-algebras.  If δ ( A ) is finite, then A is the full matrix algebra M δ ( A ) . A UHF algebra is said to be of infinite type if each t p in δ ( A ) is 0 or ∞.  In the language of K-theory , each supernatural number       δ   (  A  )    =    ∏  p    p   t  p           δ  A     subscript  product  p    superscript  p   subscript  t  p       \delta(A)=\prod_{p}p^{t_{p}}     specifies an additive subgroup of R that is the rational numbers of the type n / m where m formally divides δ ( A ). This group is the K 0 group of A .  An example  One example of a UHF C*-algebra is the CAR algebra . It is defined as follows: let H be a separable complex Hilbert space H with orthonormal basis f n and L ( H ) the bounded operators on H , consider a linear map      α  :   H  →   L   (  H  )        normal-:  α   normal-→  H    L  H      \alpha:H\rightarrow L(H)     with the property that         {   α   (   f  n   )    ,   α   (   f  m   )    }   =   0  and       α    (   f  n   )   *   α   (   f  m   )    +   α   (   f  m   )   α    (   f  n   )   *     =    ⟨   f  m   ,   f  n   ⟩   I     .     formulae-sequence       α   subscript  f  n      α   subscript  f  m      0  and          α   superscript   subscript  f  n     α   subscript  f  m      α   subscript  f  m   α   superscript   subscript  f  n           subscript  f  m    subscript  f  n    I      \{\alpha(f_{n}),\alpha(f_{m})\}=0\quad\mbox{and}\quad\alpha(f_{n})^{*}\alpha(f%
 _{m})+\alpha(f_{m})\alpha(f_{n})^{*}=\langle f_{m},f_{n}\rangle I.     The CAR algebra is the C*-algebra generated by       {   α   (   f  n   )    }   .       α   subscript  f  n      \{\alpha(f_{n})\}\;.     The embedding        C  *    (   α   (   f  1   )    ,  ⋯  ,   α   (   f  n   )    )    ↪    C  *    (   α   (   f  1   )    ,  ⋯  ,   α   (   f   n  +  1    )    )       normal-↪     superscript  C       α   subscript  f  1    normal-⋯    α   subscript  f  n         superscript  C       α   subscript  f  1    normal-⋯    α   subscript  f    n  1         C^{*}(\alpha(f_{1}),\cdots,\alpha(f_{n}))\hookrightarrow C^{*}(\alpha(f_{1}),%
 \cdots,\alpha(f_{n+1}))     can be identified with the multiplicity 2 embedding        M   2  n    ↪   M   2   n  +  1      .     normal-↪   subscript  M   superscript  2  n     subscript  M   superscript  2    n  1       M_{2^{n}}\hookrightarrow M_{2^{n+1}}.     Therefore the CAR algebra has supernatural number 2 ∞ . 3 This identification also yields that its K 0 group is the dyadic rationals .  References    "  Category:C*-algebras     ↩  ↩  ↩
