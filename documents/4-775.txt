   Discrete valuation      Discrete valuation   In mathematics , a discrete valuation is an integer  valuation on a field  K , that is a function      ν  :   K  →   ℤ  ∪   {  ∞  }        normal-:  ν   normal-→  K    ℤ         \nu:K\to\mathbb{Z}\cup\{\infty\}     satisfying the conditions       ν   (   x  ⋅  y   )    =    ν   (  x  )    +   ν   (  y  )           ν   normal-⋅  x  y        ν  x     ν  y      \nu(x\cdot y)=\nu(x)+\nu(y)          ν   (   x  +  y   )    ≥   min   {   ν   (  x  )    ,   ν   (  y  )    }          ν    x  y        ν  x     ν  y      \nu(x+y)\geq\min\big\{\nu(x),\nu(y)\big\}           ν   (  x  )    =  ∞   ⇔   x  =  0      iff      ν  x       x  0     \nu(x)=\infty\iff x=0     for all     x  ,  y   ∈  K       x  y   K    x,y\in K   .  Note that often the trivial valuation which takes on only the values    0  ,  ∞     0     0,\infty   is explicitly excluded.  A field with a non-trivial discrete valuation is called a discrete valuation field .  Discrete valuation rings and valuations on fields  To every field with discrete valuation   ν   ν   \nu   we can associate the subring         𝒪  K   :=   {   x  ∈  K   ∣    ν   (  x  )    ≥  0   }      assign   subscript  𝒪  K    conditional-set    x  K       ν  x   0      \mathcal{O}_{K}:=\left\{x\in K\mid\nu(x)\geq 0\right\}        of   K   K   K   , which is a discrete valuation ring . Conversely, the valuation    ν  :   A  →    \Z   ∪   {  ∞  }        normal-:  ν   normal-→  A    \Z         \nu:A\rightarrow\Z\cup\{\infty\}   on a discrete valuation ring   A   A   A   can be extended in a unique way to a discrete valuation on the quotient field     K  =   Quot   (  A  )        K    Quot  A     K=\text{Quot}(A)   ; the associated discrete valuation ring    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    \mathcal{O}_{K}   is just   A   A   A   .  Examples   For a fixed prime    p   p   p   and for any element    x  ∈  ℚ      x  ℚ    x\in\mathbb{Q}   different from zero write    x  =    p  j    a  b        x     superscript  p  j     a  b      x=p^{j}\frac{a}{b}   with     j  ,  a  ,  b   ∈   \Z        j  a  b   \Z    j,a,b\in\Z   such that   p   p   p   does not divide    a  ,  b     a  b    a,b   , then     ν   (  x  )    =  j        ν  x   j    \nu(x)=j   is a discrete valuation on    \Q    \Q   \Q   , called the p-adic valuation.    Given a Riemann surface    X   X   X   , we can consider the field    K  =   M   (  X  )        K    M  X     K=M(X)   of meromorphic functions     X  →    \C   ∪   {   \infin   }       normal-→  X    \C   \infin      X\to\C\cup\{\infin\}   . For a fixed point    p  ∈  X      p  X    p\in X   , we define a discrete valuation on   K   K   K   as follows     ν   (  f  )    =  j        ν  f   j    \nu(f)=j   if and only if   j   j   j   is the largest integer such that the function     f   (  z  )    /    (   z  -  p   )   j         f  z    superscript    z  p   j     f(z)/(z-p)^{j}   can be extended to a holomorphic function at   p   p   p   . This means: if     ν   (  f  )    =  j  >  0          ν  f   j       0     \nu(f)=j>0   then   f   f   f   has a root of order   j   j   j   at the point   p   p   p   ; if     ν   (  f  )    =  j  <  0          ν  f   j       0     \nu(f)=j<0   then   f   f   f   has a pole of order    -  j      j    -j   at   p   p   p   . In a similar manner, one also defines a discrete valuation on the function field of an algebraic curve for every regular point   p   p   p   on the curve.
