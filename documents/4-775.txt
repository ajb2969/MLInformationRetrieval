Discrete valuation

In mathematics, a discrete valuation is an integer valuation on a field K, that is a function



satisfying the conditions









for all 
 
 
 
 .
Note that often the trivial valuation which takes on only the values 
 
 
 
  is explicitly excluded.
A field with a non-trivial discrete valuation is called a discrete valuation field.
Discrete valuation rings and valuations on fields
To every field with discrete valuation 
 
 
 
  we can associate the subring








of 
 
 
 
 , which is a discrete valuation ring. Conversely, the valuation 
 
 
 
  on a discrete valuation ring 
 
 
 
  can be extended in a unique way to a discrete valuation on the quotient field

 
 ; the associated discrete valuation ring 
 
 
 
  is just 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

For a fixed prime

 
  and for any element 
 
 
 
  different from zero write 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  does not divide 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a discrete valuation on 
 
 
 
 , called the p-adic valuation.


Given a Riemann surface

 
 , we can consider the field 
 
 
 
  of meromorphic functions

 
 . For a fixed point 
 
 
 
 , we define a discrete valuation on 
 
 
 
  as follows
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is the largest integer such that the function 
 
 
 
  can be extended to a holomorphic function at 
 
 
 
 . This means: if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  has a root of order 
 
 
 
  at the point 
 
 
 
 ; if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  has a pole of order 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . In a similar manner, one also defines a discrete valuation on the function field of an algebraic curve for every regular point 
 
 
 
  on the curve.
