   Quasivariety      Quasivariety   In mathematics , a quasivariety is a class of algebraic structures generalizing the notion of variety by allowing equational conditions on the axioms defining the class.  __TOC__  Definition  A trivial algebra contains just one element. A quasivariety is a class K of algebras with a specified signature satisfying any of the following equivalent conditions. 1  1. K is a pseudoelementary class closed under subalgebras and direct products.  2. K is the class of all models of a set of quasiidentities , that is, implications of the form     s  1   ≈    t  1   ∧  …  ∧   s  n    ≈   t  n   →  s  ≈  t         subscript  s  1      subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  s  n          subscript  t  n     normal-→    s       t     s_{1}\approx t_{1}\land\ldots\land s_{n}\approx t_{n}\rightarrow s\approx t   , where    s  ,   s  1   ,  …  ,   s  n   ,  t  ,   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n      s   subscript  s  1   normal-…   subscript  s  n   t   subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n     s,s_{1},\ldots,s_{n},t,t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}   are terms built up from variables using the operation symbols of the specified signature.  3. K contains a trivial algebra and is closed under isomorphisms, subalgebras, and reduced products .  4. K contains a trivial algebra and is closed under isomorphisms, subalgebras, direct products, and ultraproducts .  Examples  Every variety is a quasivariety by virtue of an equation being a quasiidentity for which n = 0.  Every class of ordered algebras is a quasivariety, since the partial order axioms are quasiidentities. 2  References  "  Category:Universal algebra     ↩  ↩
