   Diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase      Diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase   In enzymology , an ethanolaminephosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CDP-ethanolamine + 1,2-diacylglycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + a phosphatidylethanolamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-ethanolamine and 1,2-diacylglycerol , whereas its two products are CMP and phosphatidylethanolamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-ethanolamine:1,2-diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase . Other names in common use include EPT , diacylglycerol ethanolaminephosphotransferase , CDPethanolamine diglyceride phosphotransferase , and phosphorylethanolamine-glyceride transferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : aminophosphonate metabolism , glycerophospholipid metabolism , and ether lipid metabolism .
