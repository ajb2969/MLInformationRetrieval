GDP-mannose 3,5-epimerase

In enzymology, a GDP-mannose 3,5-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

GDP-mannose 
 
 
 
  GDP-L-galactose
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, GDP-mannose, and one product, GDP-L-galactose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-mannose 3,5-epimerase. Other names in common use include GDP-D-mannose:GDP-L-galactose epimerase, guanosine 5'-diphosphate D-mannose:guanosine 5'-diphosphate, and L-galactose epimerase. This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
