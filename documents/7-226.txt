   Orthogonal wavelet      Orthogonal wavelet   An orthogonal wavelet is a wavelet whose associated wavelet transform is orthogonal . That is, the inverse wavelet transform is the adjoint of the wavelet transform. If this condition is weakened one may end up with biorthogonal wavelets .  Basics  The scaling function is a refinable function . That is, it is a fractal functional equation, called the refinement equation ( twin-scale relation or dilation equation ):       ϕ   (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0    N  -  1      a  k   ϕ   (    2  x   -  k   )           ϕ  x     superscript   subscript     k  0      N  1       subscript  a  k   ϕ      2  x   k       \phi(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{N-1}a_{k}\phi(2x-k)   , where the sequence    (   a  0   ,  …  ,   a   N  -  1    )      subscript  a  0   normal-…   subscript  a    N  1      (a_{0},\dots,a_{N-1})   of real numbers is called a scaling sequence or scaling mask. The wavelet proper is obtained by a similar linear combination,       ψ   (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0    M  -  1      b  k   ϕ   (    2  x   -  k   )           ψ  x     superscript   subscript     k  0      M  1       subscript  b  k   ϕ      2  x   k       \psi(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{M-1}b_{k}\phi(2x-k)   , where the sequence    (   b  0   ,  …  ,   b   M  -  1    )      subscript  b  0   normal-…   subscript  b    M  1      (b_{0},\dots,b_{M-1})   of real numbers is called a wavelet sequence or wavelet mask.  A necessary condition for the orthogonality of the wavelets is that the scaling sequence is orthogonal to any shifts of it by an even number of coefficients:        ∑   n  ∈   \Z       a  n    a   n  +   2  m       =   2   δ   m  ,  0           subscript     n  \Z       subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n    2  m         2   subscript  δ   m  0       \sum_{n\in\Z}a_{n}a_{n+2m}=2\delta_{m,0}     In this case there is the same number M=N of coefficients in the scaling as in the wavelet sequence, the wavelet sequence can be determined as     b  n   =     (   -  1   )   n    a   N  -  1  -  n          subscript  b  n      superscript    1   n    subscript  a    N  1  n       b_{n}=(-1)^{n}a_{N-1-n}   . In some cases the opposite sign is chosen.  Vanishing moments, polynomial approximation and smoothness  A necessary condition for the existence of a solution to the refinement equation is that some power (1+Z) A , A>0 , divides the polynomial     a   (  Z  )    :=    a  0   +    a  1   Z   +  …  +    a   N  -  1     Z   N  -  1         assign    a  Z      subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   Z   normal-…     subscript  a    N  1     superscript  Z    N  1        a(Z):=a_{0}+a_{1}Z+\dots+a_{N-1}Z^{N-1}   (see Z-transform ). The maximally possible power A is called polynomial approximation order (or pol. app. power) or number of vanishing moments . It describes the ability to represent polynomials up to degree A-1 with linear combinations of integer translates of the scaling function.  In the biorthogonal case, an approximation order A of   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   corresponds to A  vanishing moments of the dual wavelet    ψ  ~     normal-~  ψ    \tilde{\psi}   , that is, the scalar products of    ψ  ~     normal-~  ψ    \tilde{\psi}   with any polynomial up to degree A-1 are zero. In the opposite direction, the approximation order Ã of    ϕ  ~     normal-~  ϕ    \tilde{\phi}   is equivalent to Ã vanishing moments of   ψ   ψ   \psi   . In the orthogonal case, A and Ã coincide.  A sufficient condition for the existence of a scaling function is the following: if one decomposes     a   (  Z  )    =    2   1  -  A      (   1  +  Z   )   A   p   (  Z  )          a  Z      superscript  2    1  A     superscript    1  Z   A   p  Z     a(Z)=2^{1-A}(1+Z)^{A}p(Z)   , and the estimate      1  ≤    sup   t  ∈   [  0  ,   2  π   ]      |   p   (   e   i  t    )    |    <   2   A  -  1  -  n          1    subscript  supremum    t   0    2  π          p   superscript  e    i  t             superscript  2    A  1  n       1\leq\sup_{t\in[0,2\pi]}|p(e^{it})|<2^{A-1-n}   for some    n  ∈  𝒩      n  𝒩    n\in\mathcal{N}   , holds, then the refinement equation has a n times continuously differentiable solution with compact support.  Examples:        a   (  Z  )    =    2   1  -  A      (   1  +  Z   )   A          a  Z      superscript  2    1  A     superscript    1  Z   A      a(Z)=2^{1-A}(1+Z)^{A}   , that is p(Z)=1 , has n=A-2 . The solutions are Schoenbergs B-splines of order A-1 , where the (A-1) -th derivative is piecewise constant, thus the (A-2) -th derivative is Lipschitz-continuous . A=1 corresponds to the index function of the unit interval.  A=2 and p linear may be written as     a   (  Z  )    =    1  4      (   1  +  Z   )   2     (    (   1  +  Z   )   +   c   (   1  -  Z   )     )          a  Z       1  4    superscript    1  Z   2       1  Z     c    1  Z        a(Z)=\frac{1}{4}(1+Z)^{2}\,((1+Z)+c(1-Z))   . Expansion of this degree 3 polynomial and insertion of the 4 coefficients into the orthogonality condition results in c²=3 . The positive root gives the scaling sequence of the D4-wavelet, see below.   References   Ingrid Daubechies : Ten Lectures on Wavelets , SIAM 1992,   "  *
