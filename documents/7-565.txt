   Seminormal subgroup      Seminormal subgroup   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a subgroup    A   A   A   of a group   G   G   G   is termed seminormal if there is a subgroup   B   B   B   such that     A  B   =  G        A  B   G    AB=G   , and for any proper subgroup   C   C   C   of   B   B   B   ,    A  C      A  C    AC   is a proper subgroup of   G   G   G   .  This definition of seminormal subgroups is due to Xiang Ying Su . 1 2  Every normal subgroup is seminormal. For finite groups, every quasinormal subgroup is seminormal.
