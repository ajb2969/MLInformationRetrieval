The Euler–Mascheroni constant (also called Euler's constant) is a mathematical constant recurring in analysis and number theory, usually denoted by the lowercase Greek letter  (
 
 
 
 ).
It is defined as the limiting difference between the harmonic series and the natural logarithm:

History
The constant first appeared in a 1734 paper by the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler, titled De Progressionibus harmonicis observationes (Eneström Index 43). Euler used the notations C and O for the constant. In 1790, Italian mathematician Lorenzo Mascheroni used the notations A and a for the constant. The notation 
 
 
 
  appears nowhere in the writings of either Euler or Mascheroni, and was chosen at a later time perhaps because of the constant's connection to the gamma function.2 For example, the German mathematician Carl Anton Bretschneider used the notation 
 
 
 
  in 18353 and Augustus De Morgan used it in a textbook published in parts from 1836 to 1842.4

Properties
The number 
 
 
 
  has not been proved algebraic or transcendental. In fact, it is not even known whether 
 
 
 
  is irrational. Continued fraction analysis reveals that if 
 
 
 
  is rational, its denominator must be greater than 10242080.5 The ubiquity of 
 
 
 
  revealed by the large number of equations below makes the irrationality of 
 
 
 
  a major open question in mathematics. Also see Sondow (2003a).
Relation to gamma function


 
  is related to the digamma function Ψ, and hence the derivative of the gamma function Γ, when both functions are evaluated at 1. Thus:



This is equal to the limits:



Further limit results are (Krämer, 2005):






A limit related to the beta function (expressed in terms of gamma functions) is






Relation to the zeta function


 
  can also be expressed as an infinite sum whose terms involve the Riemann zeta function evaluated at positive integers:



Other series related to the zeta function include:



The error term in the last equation is a rapidly decreasing function of n. As a result, the formula is well-suited for efficient computation of the constant to high precision.
Other interesting limits equaling the Euler–Mascheroni constant are the antisymmetric limit (Sondow, 1998)



and de la Vallée-Poussin's formula



Closely related to this is the rational zeta series expression. By taking separately the first few terms of the series above, one obtains an estimate for the classical series limit:


 
  where ζ(s,k) is the Hurwitz zeta function. The sum in this equation involves the harmonic numbers, Hn. Expanding some of the terms in the Hurwitz zeta function gives:


 
 , where 
 
 

Integrals


 
  equals the value of a number of definite integrals:


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the fractional Harmonic number.
Definite integrals in which 
 
 
 
  appears include:






One can express 
 
 
 
  using a special case of Hadjicostas's formula as a double integral (Sondow 2003a, 2005) with equivalent series:


 
  An interesting comparison by J. Sondow (2005) is the double integral and alternating series



It shows that 
 
 
 
 
  may be thought of as an "alternating Euler constant".
The two constants are also related by the pair of series (see Sondow 2005 #2)






where N1(n) and N0(n) are the number of 1's and 0's, respectively, in the base 2 expansion of n.
We have also Catalan's 1875 integral (see Sondow and Zudilin)



Series expansions
Euler showed that the following infinite series approaches 
 
 
 
 :



The series for 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to series Nielsen found in 1897:



In 1910, Vacca found the closely related series:



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the logarithm of base 2 and 
 
 
 
  is the floor function.
In 1926 he found a second series:



From the Malmsten-Kummer-expansion for the logarithm of the gamma function we get:

  is the nth harmonic number.)

The third formula is also called the Ramanujan expansion.
Relations with the reciprocal logarithm
The reciprocal logarithm function (Krämer, 2005)


 
  has a deep connection with Euler's constant and was studied by James Gregory in connection with numerical integration. The coefficients 
 
 
 
  are called Gregory coefficients; the first six were given in a letter to John Collins in 1670. From the equations


 
  , which can be used recursively to get these coefficients for all 
 
 
 
 , we get the table

(numerators), (denominators)



Gregory coefficients are similar to Bernoulli numbers and satisfy the asymptotic relation


 
  and the integral representation


 
  Euler's constant has the integral representations


 
  A very important expansion of Gregorio Fontana (1780) is:


 
 
  which is convergent for all n.
Weighted sums of the Gregory coefficients give different constants:



eγ
The constant eγ is important in number theory. Some authors denote this quantity simply as 
 
 
 
 . eγ equals the following limit, where pn is the nth prime number:


 
  This restates the third of Mertens' theorems.7 The numerical value of eγ is:

1.78107241799019798523650410310717954916964521430343 … .
 

Other infinite products relating to eγ include:






These products result from the Barnes G-function.
We also have


 
  where the nth factor is the (n+1)st root of


 
  This infinite product, first discovered by Ser in 1926, was rediscovered by Sondow (2003) using hypergeometric functions.
Continued fraction
The continued fraction expansion of 
 
 
 
  is of the form [0; 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 4, 3, 13, 5, 1, 1, 8, 1, 2, 4, 1, 1, 40, ...] , of which there is no apparent pattern. The continued fraction has at least 470,000 terms,8 and it has infinitely many terms if and only if

 
  is irrational.
Generalizations
Euler's generalized constants are given by



for 0 \gamma as the special case α = 1.9 This can be further generalized to



for some arbitrary decreasing function f. For example,



gives rise to the Stieltjes constants, and



gives



where again the limit



appears.
A two-dimensional limit generalization is the Masser–Gramain constant.
Euler-Lehmer constants are given by summation of inverses of numbers in a common modulo class10 ,11

  then



Published digits
Euler initially calculated the constant's value to 6 decimal places. In 1781, he calculated it to 16 decimal places. Mascheroni attempted to calculate the constant to 32 decimal places, but made errors in the 20th–22nd decimal places; starting from the 20th digit, he calculated ...1811209008239 when the correct value is ...0651209008240.
