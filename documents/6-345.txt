   Inelastic mean free path      Inelastic mean free path   The inelastic mean free path ( IMFP ) is an index of how far an electron on average travels through a solid before losing energy.  (Figure)  Universal curve for the electron inelastic mean free path in elements based on equation (5) in. 1   If a monochromatic primary beam of electrons is incident on a solid surface, the majority of incident electrons lose their energy because they interact strongly with matter, leading to plasmon excitation, electron-hole pair formation, and vibrational excitation. 2 The intensity of the primary electrons,    I  0     subscript  I  0    \textstyle I_{0}   , is damped as a function of the distance,   d   d   \textstyle d   , into the solid. The intensity decay can be expressed as follows:       I   (  d  )    =     I  0     e   -     d   /  λ    (  E  )             I  d      subscript  I  0    superscript  e        d  λ   E        I(d)=I_{0}\ e^{-d\ /\lambda(E)}     where    I   (  d  )       I  d    \textstyle I(d)   is the intensity after the primary electron beam has traveled through the solid. The parameter    λ   (  E  )       λ  E    \textstyle\lambda(E)   , termed the inelastic mean free path (IMFP), is defined as the distance an electron beam can travel before its intensity decays to    1  /  e      1  e    \textstyle 1/e   of its initial value. The inelastic mean free path of electrons can roughly be described by a universal curve, which is the same for all materials. 3 4  See also   Scattering theory   Footnotes  "  Category:Atomic, molecular, and optical physics      R.
