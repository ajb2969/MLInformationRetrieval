   Brus equation      Brus equation   The Brus equation 1 can be used to describe the emission energy of quantum dot  semiconductor  nanocrystals (such as CdSe nanocrystals) in terms of the band gap energy  E gap , Planck's constant  h , the radius of the quantum dot r , as well as the effective mass of the excited electron  m e * and of the electron hole  m h *.  The radius of the quantum dot affects the wavelength of the emitted light due to quantum confinement , and this equation describes the effect of changing the radius of the quantum dot on the wavelength λ of the emitted light (and thereby on the emission energy Δ E = hc /λ, where c is the speed of light ). This is useful for calculating the radius of a quantum dot from experimentally determined parameters.  The overall equation is 2        Δ  E   (  r  )    =    E  gap   +     h  2    8   r  2      (    1  /   m  e  *    +   1  /   m  h  *     )      .        normal-Δ  E  r      subscript  E  gap        superscript  h  2     8   superscript  r  2         1   superscript   subscript  m  normal-e        1   superscript   subscript  m  normal-h           \Delta E(r)=E_{\mathrm{gap}}+\frac{h^{2}}{8r^{2}}\left(1/m_{\mathrm{e}}^{*}+1/%
 m_{\mathrm{h}}^{*}\right).     E gap , m e *, and m h * are unique for each nanocrystal composition. For example, with CdSe nanocrystals:   E gap (CdSe) = 1.74 eV = 2.8·10 −19 Joules,  m e * (CdSe) = 0.13 m e = 1.18·10 −31 kg,  m h * (CdSe) = 0.45 m e = 4.09·10 −31 kg.
