Kampyle of Eudoxus

The Kampyle of Eudoxus (Greek: καμπύλη [γραμμή], meaning simply "curved [line], curve") is a curve, with a Cartesian equation of



from which the solution x = y = 0 should be excluded.
Alternative parameterizations
In polar coordinates, the Kampyle has the equation



Equivalently, it has a parametric representation as,


 
 .
History
This quartic curve was studied by the Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 408 BC – c.347 BC) in relation to the classical problem of doubling the cube.
Properties
The Kampyle is symmetric about both the 
 
 
 
 - and 
 
 
 
 -axes. It crosses the 
 
 
 
 -axis at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It has inflection points at



(four inflections, one in each quadrant). The top half of the curve is asymptotic to 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , and in fact can be written as



where



is the 
 
 
 
 th Catalan number.
