   Kampyle of Eudoxus      Kampyle of Eudoxus   The Kampyle of Eudoxus ( Greek : καμπύλη [γραμμή], meaning simply "curved [line], curve") is a curve , with a Cartesian equation of       x  4   =    x  2   +   y  2         superscript  x  4      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      x^{4}=x^{2}+y^{2}     from which the solution x = y = 0 should be excluded.  Alternative parameterizations  In polar coordinates , the Kampyle has the equation       r  =    sec  2    θ     .      r    superscript   2   θ     r=\sec^{2}\theta\,.     Equivalently, it has a parametric representation as,       x  =   a   sec   (  t  )      ,   y  =   a   tan   (  t  )     sec   (  t  )         formulae-sequence    x    a    t       y    a    t     t       x=a\sec(t),y=a\tan(t)\sec(t)   .  History  This quartic curve was studied by the Greek astronomer and mathematician Eudoxus of Cnidus (c. 408 BC – c.347 BC) in relation to the classical problem of doubling the cube .  Properties  The Kampyle is symmetric about both the   x   x   x   - and   y   y   y   -axes. It crosses the   x   x   x   -axis at    (   -  1   ,  0  )       1   0    (-1,0)   and    (  1  ,  0  )     1  0    (1,0)   . It has inflection points at      (   ±    3  /  2     ,   ±    3   /  2    )      plus-or-minus      3  2      plus-or-minus      3   2      (\pm\sqrt{3/2},\pm\sqrt{3}/2)     (four inflections, one in each quadrant). The top half of the curve is asymptotic to     x  2   -   1  2        superscript  x  2     1  2     x^{2}-\frac{1}{2}   as    x  →  ∞     normal-→  x     x\to\infty   , and in fact can be written as      y  =    x  2     1  -   x   -  2       =    x  2   -    1  2     ∑   n  ≥  0      C  n     (   2  x   )    -   2  n               y     superscript  x  2       1   superscript  x    2               superscript  x  2       1  2     subscript     n  0       subscript  C  n    superscript    2  x       2  n            y=x^{2}\sqrt{1-x^{-2}}=x^{2}-\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n\geq 0}C_{n}(2x)^{-2n}     where       C  n   =    1   n  +  1     (      2  n       n     )         subscript  C  n       1    n  1     binomial    2  n   n      C_{n}=\frac{1}{n+1}{\left({{2n}\atop{n}}\right)}     is the   n   n   n   th Catalan number .
