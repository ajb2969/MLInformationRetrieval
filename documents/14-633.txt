   De Moivre's law      De Moivre's law   De Moivre's Law is a survival model applied in actuarial science , named for Abraham de Moivre . 1 2 3 It is a simple law of mortality based on a linear survival function .  Definition  De Moivre's law has a single parameter   ω   ω   \omega   called the ultimate age . Under de Moivre's law, a newborn has probability of surviving at least x years given by the survival function 4         S   (  x  )    =   1  -   x  ω     ,   0  ≤  x  <  ω    .     formulae-sequence      S  x     1    x  ω         0  x       ω      S(x)=1-\frac{x}{\omega},\qquad 0\leq x<\omega.   In actuarial notation  (x) denotes a status or life that has survived to age x , and T ( x ) is the future lifetime of (x) ( T ( x ) is a random variable). The conditional probability that (x) survives to age x+t is Pr[T(0) ≥ x+t | T(0) ≥ x] = S(x+t) / S(x), which is denoted by    p  x    t      subscript   subscript  p  x   t    {}_{t}p_{x}   . 5 Under de Moivre's law, the conditional probability that a life aged x years survives at least t more years is         p  x    t    =    S   (   x  +  t   )     S   (  x  )     =    ω  -   (   x  +  t   )     ω  -  x     ,   0  ≤  t  <   ω  -  x     ,     formulae-sequence       subscript   subscript  p  x   t       S    x  t      S  x             ω    x  t      ω  x          0  t         ω  x       {}_{t}p_{x}=\frac{S(x+t)}{S(x)}=\frac{\omega-(x+t)}{\omega-x},\qquad 0\leq t<%
 \omega-x,   and the future lifetime random variable T ( x ) therefore follows a uniform distribution on    (  0  ,   ω  -  x   )     0    ω  x     (0,\,\omega-x)   .  The actuarial notation for conditional probability of failure is    q  x    t      subscript   subscript  q  x   t    {}_{t}q_{x}    = Pr[0 ≤ T(x) ≤ t|T(0) ≥ x] . Under de Moivre's law, the probability that (x) fails to survive to age x+t is        q  x    t    =     S   (  x  )    -   S   (   x  +  t   )      S   (  x  )     =   t   ω  -  x     .         subscript   subscript  q  x   t         S  x     S    x  t       S  x           t    ω  x       {}_{t}q_{x}=\frac{S(x)-S(x+t)}{S(x)}=\frac{t}{\omega-x}.     The force of mortality ( hazard rate or failure rate ) is      μ   (  x  )    =   -      S  ′    (  x  )    /  S    (  x  )     =     f   (  x  )    /  S    (  x  )     ,          μ  x            superscript  S  normal-′   x   S   x               f  x   S   x      \mu(x)=-S^{\prime}(x)/S(x)=f(x)/S(x),   where f(x) is the probability density function. Under de Moivre's law, the force of mortality for a life aged x is         μ   (   x  +  t   )    =   1   ω  -   (   x  +  t   )      ,   0  ≤  t  <   ω  -  x     ,     formulae-sequence      μ    x  t      1    ω    x  t          0  t         ω  x       \mu(x+t)=\frac{1}{\omega-(x+t)},\qquad 0\leq t<\omega-x,   which has the property of increasing failure rate (IFR) with respect to age that is usually assumed for humans, or anything subject to aging.  De Moivre's law is applied as a simple analytical law of mortality and the linear assumption is also applied as a model for interpolation for discrete survival models such as life tables .  Linear assumption for fractional years  When applied for interpolation, the linear assumption is called uniform distribution of death (UDD) assumption in fractional years and it is equivalent to linear interpolation . If    ℓ  x     subscript  normal-ℓ  x    \ell_{x}   denotes the number of survivors at exact age x years out of an initial cohort of    ℓ  0     subscript  normal-ℓ  0    \ell_{0}   lives, the UDD assumption for fractional years is that      t   q  x       t   subscript  q  x     tq_{x}   that a life aged x fails within (0,t), is     μ   (   x  +  t   )    =    q  x    1  -   t   q  x            μ    x  t       subscript  q  x     1    t   subscript  q  x        \mu(x+t)=\frac{q_{x}}{1-tq_{x}}   , and    p  x    t      subscript   subscript  p  x   t    {}_{t}p_{x}   , for   ω   ω   \omega        Abraham de Moivre (1725) Annuities upon Lives .
