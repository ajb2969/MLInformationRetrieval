L-amino-acid dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a L-amino-acid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

an L-amino acid + H2O + NAD+

 
  a 2-oxo acid + NH3 + NADH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-amino acid, H2O, and NAD+, whereas its 4 products are 2-oxo acid, NH3, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-amino-acid:NAD+ oxidoreductase (deaminating).
