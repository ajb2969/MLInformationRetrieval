   Nullcline      Nullcline   In mathematical analysis , nullclines , sometimes called zero-growth isoclines , are encountered in a system of ordinary differential equations       x  1  ‚Ä≤   =    f  1    (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   )         superscript   subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä≤      subscript  f  1     subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n       x_{1}^{\prime}=f_{1}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})          x  2  ‚Ä≤   =    f  2    (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   )         superscript   subscript  x  2   normal-‚Ä≤      subscript  f  2     subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n       x_{2}^{\prime}=f_{2}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})          ‚ãÆ   normal-‚ãÆ   \vdots            x  n  ‚Ä≤   =    f  n    (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   )         superscript   subscript  x  n   normal-‚Ä≤      subscript  f  n     subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n       x_{n}^{\prime}=f_{n}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})      where    x  ‚Ä≤     superscript  x  normal-‚Ä≤    x^{\prime}   here represents a derivative of   x   x   x   with respect to another parameter, such as time   t   t   t   . The   j   j   j   'th nullcline is the geometric shape for which     x  j  ‚Ä≤   =  0       superscript   subscript  x  j   normal-‚Ä≤   0    x_{j}^{\prime}=0   . The fixed points of the system are located where all of the nullclines intersect. In a two-dimensional linear system , the nullclines can be represented by two lines on a two-dimensional plot; in a general two-dimensional system they are arbitrary curves.  History  The definition, though with the name ‚Äôdirectivity curve‚Äô, was used in a 1967 article by Endre Simonyi 1 . This article also defined 'directivity vector' as    ùê∞  =    sign   (  P  )   ùê¢   +   sign   (  Q  )   ùê£        ùê∞      sign  P  ùê¢     sign  Q  ùê£      \mathbf{w}=\mathrm{sign}(P)\mathbf{i}+\mathrm{sign}(Q)\mathbf{j}   , where P and Q are the dx/dt and dy/dt differential equations, and i and j are the x and y direction unit vectors.  Simonyi developed a new stability test method from these new definitions, and with it he studied differential equations. This method, beyond the usual stability examinations, provided semiquantative results.  References  1.E.
