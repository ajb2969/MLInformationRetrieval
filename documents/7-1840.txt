Nullcline

In mathematical analysis, nullclines, sometimes called zero-growth isoclines, are encountered in a system of ordinary differential equations

















where 
 
 
 
  here represents a derivative of 
 
 
 
  with respect to another parameter, such as time 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
 'th nullcline is the geometric shape for which 
 
 
 
 
 . The fixed points of the system are located where all of the nullclines intersect. In a two-dimensional linear system, the nullclines can be represented by two lines on a two-dimensional plot; in a general two-dimensional system they are arbitrary curves.
History
The definition, though with the name ’directivity curve’, was used in a 1967 article by Endre Simonyi1. This article also defined 'directivity vector' as 
 
 
 
 , where P and Q are the dx/dt and dy/dt differential equations, and i and j are the x and y direction unit vectors.
Simonyi developed a new stability test method from these new definitions, and with it he studied differential equations. This method, beyond the usual stability examinations, provided semiquantative results.
