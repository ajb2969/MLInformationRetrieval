   2-hydroxymuconate-semialdehyde hydrolase      2-hydroxymuconate-semialdehyde hydrolase   In enzymology , a 2-hydroxymuconate-semialdehyde hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formate + 2-oxopent-4-enoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-hydroxymuconate semialdehyde and H 2 O , whereas its two products are formate and 2-oxopent-4-enoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon-carbon bonds in ketonic substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-hydroxymuconate-semialdehyde formylhydrolase . Other names in common use include 2-hydroxy-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienoate hydrolase , 2-hydroxymuconic semialdehyde hydrolase , HMSH , and HOD hydrolase . This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways : benzoate degradation via hydroxylation , toluene and xylene degradation , 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation , carbazole degradation , and styrene degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 10 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , and .
