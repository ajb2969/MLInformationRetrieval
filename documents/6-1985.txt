   Curtal sonnet      Curtal sonnet   The curtal sonnet is a form invented by Gerard Manley Hopkins , and used in three of his poems.  It is an eleven-line (or, more accurately, ten-and-a-half-line) sonnet , but rather than the first eleven lines of a standard sonnet it consists of precisely ¾ of the structure of a Petrarchan sonnet shrunk proportionally. The octave of a sonnet becomes a sestet and the sestet a quatrain plus an additional "tail piece." That is, the first eight lines of a sonnet are translated into the first six lines of a curtal sonnet and the last six lines of a sonnet are translated into the last four and a half lines of a curtal sonnet. Hopkins describes the last line as half a line, though in fact it can be shorter than half of one of Hopkins's standard sprung rhythm lines. In the preface to his Poems (1876-89), Hopkins describes the relationship between the Petrarchan and curtal sonnets mathematically; if the Petrarchan sonnet can be described by the equation 8+6=14 then, he says, the curtal sonnet would be:        12  2   +   9  2    =   21  2   =   10   1  2              12  2     9  2      21  2          10    1  2       {12\over 2}+{9\over 2}={21\over 2}=10{1\over 2}   . 1  Hopkins's only examples of the form are " Pied Beauty ," "Peace," and "Ash Boughs." "Pied Beauty" is as follows, showing the proportional relation to the Petrarchan sonnet (not included in the original: the only indication of the form is in the preface). Accents indicate stressed syllables:      Glory be to God for dappled things—  For skies of couple-colour as a brinded cow;  For rose-moles all in stipple upon trout that swim;      Fresh-firecoal chestnut-falls; finches' wings;  Landscape plotted and pieced—fold, fallow, and plough;  And áll trádes, their gear and tackle and trim.             12  2   =  6        12  2   6    {12\over 2}=6        All things counter, original, spare, strange;  Whatever is fickle, freckled (who knows how?)  With swift, slow; sweet, sour; adazzle, dim;      He fathers-forth whose beauty is past change:   Praise him.             9  2   =   4   1  2          9  2     4    1  2      {9\over 2}=4{1\over 2}        Hopkins's account of the form comes from the preface to his Poems (1876-89). Critics are generally in agreement that the curtal sonnet does not so much constitute a new form as an interpretation of sonnet form as Hopkins believed it to be; as Elisabeth Schneider argues, the curtal sonnet reveals Hopkins's intense interest in the mathematical proportions of all sonnets. 2 For an in-depth treatment of all three poems, see Lois Pitchford. 3 The form has been used occasionally since, but primarily as a novelty, in contrast to Hopkins's quite serious use.
