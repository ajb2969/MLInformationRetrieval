   6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase      6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase   In enzymology , a 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase ( PTPS ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the following chemical reaction :  7,8-Dihydroneopterin triphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin + triphosphate  Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 7,8-Dihydroneopterin triphosphate , and two products , 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin and triphosphate .  Enzyme Class  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , to be specific, those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-[(1S,2R)-1,2-dihydroxy-3-triphosphooxypropyl]-7,8-dihydropterin triphosphate-lyase (6-pyruvoyl-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin-forming) .  Synonyms  Other names in common use include 2-amino-4-oxo-6-[(1S,2R)-1,2-dihydroxy-3-triphosphooxypropyl]-7,8- , and dihydroxypteridine triphosphate lyase . This enzyme participates in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis.  Genetics  This enzyme 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin synthase is encoded by the PTS gene .
