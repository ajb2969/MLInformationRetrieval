Available energy (particle collision)

In particle physics, the available energy is the energy in a particle collision available to produce new matter from the kinetic energy of the colliding particles. Since the conservation of momentum must be held, a system of two particles with a net momentum may not convert all their kinetic energy into mass - and thus the available energy is always less than or equal to the kinetic energy of the colliding particles. The available energy for a system of one stationary particle and one moving particle is defined as:


 
  where


 
  is the total energy of the target particle,


 
  is the total energy of the moving particle,


 
  is the mass of the stationary target particle,


 
  is the mass of the moving particle, and


 
  is the speed of light.
Derivation
This derivation will use the fact that:


 
  From the principle of the conservation of linear momentum:


 
  Where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the momentums of the created and the initially moving particle respectively. From the conservation of energy:


 
  Where 
 
 
 
  is the total energy of the created particle. We know that after the collision:








 
  Donating this last equation (1). But


 
  and since the stationary particle has no momentum


 
  Therefore from (1) we have


 
  Square rooting both sides and we get
