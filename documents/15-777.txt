   Born equation      Born equation   The Born equation is a means of estimating the Gibbs free energy of solvation of a gaseous ion. It is an electrostatic model that treats the solvent as a continuous dielectric medium (it is thus one member of a class of methods known as continuum solvation methods). It was derived by Max Born . 1       Δ  G   =   -      N  A    z  2    e  2     8  π   ϵ  0    r  0      (   1  -   1   ϵ  r     )           normal-Δ  G            subscript  N  A    superscript  z  2    superscript  e  2      8  π   subscript  ϵ  0    subscript  r  0       1    1   subscript  ϵ  r         \Delta G=-\frac{N_{A}z^{2}e^{2}}{8\pi\epsilon_{0}r_{0}}\left(1-\frac{1}{%
