Born equation

The Born equation is a means of estimating the Gibbs free energy of solvation of a gaseous ion. It is an electrostatic model that treats the solvent as a continuous dielectric medium (it is thus one member of a class of methods known as continuum solvation methods). It was derived by Max Born.1

NA = Avogadro constant
z = charge of ion
e = elementary charge, 1.6022
 
 
C
ε0 = permittivity of free space
r0 = effective radius of ion
εr = dielectric constant of the solvent
