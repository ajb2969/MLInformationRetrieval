   Film temperature      Film temperature   In heat transfer and fluid dynamics , the film temperature (    T  f     subscript  T  f    T_{f}   ) is an approximation to the temperature of a fluid inside a convection  boundary layer . It is calculated as the arithmetic mean of the temperature at the surface of the solid boundary wall (    T  w     subscript  T  w    T_{w}   ) and the free-stream temperature (    T  ∞     subscript  T     T_{\infty}   ): 1       T  f   =     T  w   +   T  ∞    2        subscript  T  f        subscript  T  w    subscript  T     2     T_{f}=\frac{T_{w}+T_{\infty}}{2}     The film temperature is often used as the temperature at which fluid properties are calculated when using Prandtl number , Nusselt number , Reynolds number or Grashof number to calculate a heat transfer coefficient , because it is a reasonable first approximation to the temperature within the convection boundary layer.  Somewhat confusing terminology may be encountered in relation to boilers and heat exchangers , where the same term is used to refer to the limit (hot) temperature of a fluid in contact with a hot surface. 2 3  References    "  Category:Fluid dynamics  Category:Heat transfer     Incropera & DeWitt Fundamentals of Heat and Mass Transfer , 4th Ed ↩  Film Temperature ↩  Bulk and Film Temperatures ↩
