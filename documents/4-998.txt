   Derivation (differential algebra)      Derivation (differential algebra)   In mathematics , a derivation is a function on an algebra which generalizes certain features of the derivative operator. Specifically, given an algebra A over a ring or a field  K , a K -derivation is a K - linear map  D : A → A that satisfies Leibniz's law :        D   (   a  b   )    =    D   (  a  )   b   +   a  D   (  b  )      .        D    a  b        D  a  b     a  D  b      D(ab)=D(a)b+aD(b).     More generally, if M is an A - bimodule , a K -linear map D : A → M which satisfies the Leibniz law is also called a derivation. The collection of all K -derivations of A to itself is denoted by Der K ( A ). The collection of K -derivations of A into an A -module M is denoted by Der K ( A , M ).  Derivations occur in many different contexts in diverse areas of mathematics. The partial derivative with respect to a variable is an R -derivation on the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on R n . The Lie derivative with respect to a vector field is an R -derivation on the algebra of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold ; more generally it is a derivation on the tensor algebra of a manifold. The Pincherle derivative is an example of a derivation in abstract algebra. If the algebra A is noncommutative, then the commutator with respect to an element of the algebra A defines a linear endomorphism of A to itself, which is a derivation over K . An algebra A equipped with a distinguished derivation d forms a differential algebra , and is itself a significant object of study in areas such as differential Galois theory .  Properties  The Leibniz law itself has a number of immediate consequences. Firstly, if x 1 , x 2 , … , x n ∈ A , then it follows by mathematical induction that        D   (    x  1    x  2   ⋯   x  n    )    =    ∑  i     x  1   ⋯   x   i  -  1    D   (   x  i   )    x   i  +  1    ⋯   x  n     =    ∑  i    D   (   x  i   )     ∏   j  ≠  i     x  j       .          D     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n       subscript   i      subscript  x  1   normal-⋯   subscript  x    i  1    D   subscript  x  i    subscript  x    i  1    normal-⋯   subscript  x  n            subscript   i     D   subscript  x  i     subscript  product    j  i     subscript  x  j         D(x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{n})=\sum_{i}x_{1}\cdots x_{i-1}D(x_{i})x_{i+1}\cdots x_{%
 n}=\sum_{i}D(x_{i})\prod_{j\neq i}x_{j}.\,   (last equality holds if, for all    i  ,   D   (   x  i   )       i    D   subscript  x  i      i,\ D(x_{i})   commutes with     x  1   ,   x  2   ,   ⋯   x   i  -  1         subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     normal-⋯   subscript  x    i  1       x_{1},x_{2},\cdots x_{i-1}   ).  In particular, if A is commutative and x 1 = x 2 = … = x n , then this formula simplifies to the familiar power rule  D ( x n ) = nx n −1 D ( x ). Secondly, if A  has a unit element  1 , then D (1) = 0 since D (1) = D (1·1) = D (1) + D (1). Moreover, because D is K -linear, it follows that “the derivative of any constant function is zero”; more precisely, for any x ∈ K , D ( x ) = D ( x ·1) = x · D (1) = 0.  If k ⊂ K is a subring , and A is a k -algebra, then there is an inclusion         Der  K    (  A  ,  M  )    ⊂    Der  k    (  A  ,  M  )     ,        subscript  Der  K   A  M     subscript  Der  k   A  M     \operatorname{Der}_{K}(A,M)\subset\operatorname{Der}_{k}(A,M),\,     since any K -derivation is a fortiori a k -derivation.  The set of k -derivations from A to M , Der k ( A , M ) is a module over k . Furthermore, the k -module Der k ( A ) forms a Lie algebra with Lie bracket defined by the commutator :        [   D  1   ,   D  2   ]   =     D  1   ∘   D  2    -    D  2   ∘   D  1      .        subscript  D  1    subscript  D  2         subscript  D  1    subscript  D  2       subscript  D  2    subscript  D  1       [D_{1},D_{2}]=D_{1}\circ D_{2}-D_{2}\circ D_{1}.     It is readily verified that the Lie bracket of two derivations is again a derivation.  Graded derivations  If we have a graded algebra  A , and D is a homogeneous linear map of grade d = | D | on A then D is a homogeneous derivation if        D   (   a  b   )    =    D   (  a  )   b   +    ϵ    |  a  |    |  D  |     a  D   (  b  )      ,        D    a  b        D  a  b      superscript  ϵ      a     D     a  D  b      {D(ab)=D(a)b+\epsilon^{|a||D|}aD(b)},   ε = ±1 acting on homogeneous elements of A . A graded derivation is sum of homogeneous derivations with the same ε.  If the commutator factor ε = 1, this definition reduces to the usual case. If ε = −1, however, then:        D   (   a  b   )    =    D   (  a  )   b   +     (   -  1   )    |  a  |    a  D   (  b  )      ,        D    a  b        D  a  b      superscript    1     a    a  D  b      {D(ab)=D(a)b+(-1)^{|a|}aD(b)},   for odd | D |. They are called anti-derivations .  Examples of anti-derivations include the exterior derivative and the interior product acting on differential forms .  Graded derivations of superalgebras (i.e. Z 2 -graded algebras) are often called superderivations .
