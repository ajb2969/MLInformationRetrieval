(phosphorylase) phosphatase




(phosphorylase) phosphatase

In enzymology, a [phosphorylase] phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

[phosphorylase a] + 4 H2O 
 
 
 
  2 [phosphorylase b] + 4 phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphorylase a and H2O, whereas its two products are phosphorylase b and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is [phosphorylase a] phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include PR-enzyme, phosphorylase a phosphatase, glycogen phosphorylase phosphatase, protein phosphatase C, and type 1 protein phosphatase.
