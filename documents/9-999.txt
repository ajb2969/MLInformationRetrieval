   Differential equations of addition      Differential equations of addition   In cryptography , differential equations of addition (DEA) are one of the most basic equations related to differential cryptanalysis that mix additions over two different groups (e.g. addition modulo 2 32 and addition over GF(2)) and where input and output differences are expressed as XORs.  Examples of Differential Equations of Addition  Differential equations of addition (DEA) are of the following form:        (   x  +  y   )   ⊕   (    (   x  ⊕  a   )   +   (   y  ⊕  b   )    )    =  c       direct-sum    x  y      direct-sum  x  a    direct-sum  y  b     c    (x+y)\oplus((x\oplus a)+(y\oplus b))=c     where   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   are   n   n   n   -bit unknown variables and   a   a   a   ,   b   b   b   and   c   c   c   are known variables. The symbols   +     +   and   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   denote addition modulo     2  n     superscript  2  n    2^{n}   and bitwise exclusive-or respectively. The above equation is denoted by    (  a  ,  b  ,  c  )     a  b  c    (a,b,c)   .  Let a set    S  =   {   (   a  i   ,   b  i   ,   c  i   )   |  i      fragments  S    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   subscript  a  i   normal-,   subscript  b  i   normal-,   subscript  c  i   normal-)   normal-|  i     S=\{(a_{i},b_{i},c_{i})|i   is an integer less than    k  }     fragments  k  normal-}    k\}   denote a system of   k   k   k    DEA where   k   k   k   is a polynomial in   n   n   n   . It has been proved that the satisfiability of an arbitrary set of DEA is in the complexity class P when a brute force search requires an exponential time .  Usage of Differential Equations of Addition  Solution to an arbitrary set of DEA (either in batch and or in adaptive query model) was due to Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel . The solution techniques have been used to attack the stream cipher Helix .  References   Souradyuti Paul and Bart Preneel , Solving Systems of Differential Equations of Addition, ACISP 2005.
