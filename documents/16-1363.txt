   Hildreth–Lu estimation      Hildreth–Lu estimation   Hildreth–Lu estimation , named for Clifford Hildreth and John Y. Lu , 1 is a method adjust a linear model to serial correlation in the error term . It is an iterative procedure related to the Cochrane–Orcutt estimation .  The idea is to repeatedly apply least squares to:         y  t   -   ρ   y   t  -  1      =    α   (   1  -  ρ   )    +   β   (    X  t   -   ρ   X   t  -  1      )    +   e  t     .         subscript  y  t     ρ   subscript  y    t  1          α    1  ρ      β     subscript  X  t     ρ   subscript  X    t  1        subscript  e  t      y_{t}-\rho y_{t-1}=\alpha(1-\rho)+\beta(X_{t}-\rho X_{t-1})+e_{t}.\,   for different values of   ρ   ρ   \rho   between −1 and 1. From all these auxiliary regressions, one selects the one that yields the smallest residual sum of squares .
