Hildreth–Lu estimation

Hildreth–Lu estimation, named for Clifford Hildreth and John Y. Lu,1 is a method adjust a linear model to serial correlation in the error term. It is an iterative procedure related to the Cochrane–Orcutt estimation.
The idea is to repeatedly apply least squares to:


 
  for different values of 
 
 
 
  between −1 and 1. From all these auxiliary regressions, one selects the one that yields the smallest residual sum of squares.
