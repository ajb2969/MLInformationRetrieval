   Generalised metric      Generalised metric   In mathematics , the concept of a generalised metric is a generalisation of that of a metric , in which the distance is not a real number but taken from an arbitrary ordered field .  In general, when we define metric space the distance function is taken to be a real-valued function . The real numbers form an ordered field which is Archimedean and order complete . These metric spaces have some nice properties like: in a metric space compactness , sequential compactness and countable compactness are equivalent etc. These properties may not, however, hold so easily if the distance function is taken in an arbitrary ordered field, instead of in   ℝ   ℝ   \scriptstyle\mathbb{R}   .  Preliminary definition  Let    (  F  ,  +  ,  ⋅  ,  <  )     F   normal-⋅     (F,+,\cdot,<)   be an arbitrary ordered field, and   M   M   M   a nonempty set; a function    d  :    M  ×  M   →    F  +   ∪   {  0  }        normal-:  d   normal-→    M  M      superscript  F     0       d:M\times M\to F^{+}\cup\{0\}   is called a metric on   M   M   M   , iff the following conditions hold:         d   (  x  ,  y  )    =  0   ⇔   x  =  y      normal-⇔      d   x  y    0     x  y     d(x,y)=0\Leftrightarrow x=y   ;       d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   d   (  y  ,  x  )          d   x  y      d   y  x      d(x,y)=d(y,x)   , commutativity;        d   (  x  ,  y  )    +   d   (  y  ,  z  )     ≤   d   (  x  ,  z  )            d   x  y      d   y  z       d   x  z      d(x,y)+d(y,z)\leq d(x,z)   , triangle inequality.   It is not difficult to verify that the open balls     B   (  x  ,  δ  )    :=   {   y  ∈   M    :    d   (  x  ,  y  )    <  δ   }      assign    B   x  δ     conditional-set    y  M       d   x  y    δ      B(x,\delta)\;:=\{y\in M\;:d(x,y)<\delta\}   form a basis for a suitable topology, the latter called the metric topology on   M   M   M   , with the metric in   F   F   F   .  In view of the fact that   F   F   F   in its order topology is monotonically normal , we would expect   M   M   M   to be at least regular .  Further properties  However, under axiom of choice , every general metric is monotonically normal , for, given    x  ∈  G      x  G    x\in G   , where   G   G   G   is open, there is an open ball    B   (  x  ,  δ  )       B   x  δ     B(x,\delta)   such that    x  ∈   B   (  x  ,  δ  )    ⊆  G        x    B   x  δ         G     x\in B(x,\delta)\subseteq G   . Take     μ   (  x  ,  G  )    =   B   (  x  ,   δ  /  2   )          μ   x  G      B   x    δ  2       \mu(x,G)=B(x,\delta/2)   . Verify the conditions for Monotone Normality.  The matter of wonder is that, even without choice, general metrics are monotonically normal .  proof .  Case I: F is an Archimedean field .  Now, if x in    G  ,  G     G  G    G,G   open, we may take     μ   (  x  ,  G  )    :=   B   (  x  ,    1  /  2   n   (  x  ,  G  )    )       assign    μ   x  G      B   x      1  2   n   x  G        \mu(x,G):=B(x,1/2n(x,G))   , where     n   (  x  ,  G  )    :=   min   {    n  ∈  ℕ   :    B   (  x  ,   1  /  n   )    ⊆  G    }       assign    n   x  G       normal-:    n  ℕ       B   x    1  n     G       n(x,G):=\min\{n\in\mathbb{N}:B(x,1/n)\subseteq G\}   , and the trick is done without choice.  Case II: F is a non-Archimedean field.  For given    x  ∈  G      x  G    x\in G   where G is open, consider the set     A   (  x  ,  G  )    :=   {   a  ∈  F   :     ∀  n   ∈  ℕ   ,    B   (  x  ,   n  ⋅  a   )    ⊆  G    }      assign    A   x  G     conditional-set    a  F    formulae-sequence     for-all  n   ℕ       B   x   normal-⋅  n  a     G       A(x,G):=\{a\in F\colon\forall n\in\mathbb{N},B(x,n\cdot a)\subseteq G\}   .  The set A ( x , G ) is non-empty. For, as G is open, there is an open ball B ( x , k ) within G . Now, as F is non-Archimdedean,    ℕ  F     subscript  ℕ  F    \mathbb{N}_{F}   is not bounded above, hence there is some    ξ  ∈  F      ξ  F    \xi\in F   with      ∀  n   ∈  ℕ   :    n  ⋅  1   ≤  ξ      normal-:     for-all  n   ℕ      normal-⋅  n  1   ξ     \forall n\in\mathbb{N}\colon n\cdot 1\leq\xi   . Putting    a  =   k  ⋅    (   2  ξ   )    -  1         a   normal-⋅  k   superscript    2  ξ     1       a=k\cdot(2\xi)^{-1}   , we see that   a   a   a   is in A ( x , G ).  Now define     μ   (  x  ,  G  )    =   ⋃   {   B   (  x  ,  a  )    :   a  ∈   A   (  x  ,  G  )     }          μ   x  G       conditional-set    B   x  a      a    A   x  G         \mu(x,G)=\bigcup\{B(x,a)\colon a\in A(x,G)\}   . We would show that with respect to this mu operator, the space is monotonically normal. Note that     μ   (  x  ,  G  )    ⊆  G        μ   x  G    G    \mu(x,G)\subseteq G   .  If y is not in G (open set containing x ) and x is not in H (open set containing y ), then we'd show that     μ   (  x  ,  G  )    ∩   μ   (  y  ,  H  )          μ   x  G      μ   y  H      \mu(x,G)\cap\mu(y,H)   is empty. If not, say z is in the intersection. Then       μ   (  x  ,  G  )    ⊆  G        μ   x  G    G    \mu(x,G)\subseteq G   , which is impossible since this would imply that either y belongs to     μ   (  y  ,  H  )    ⊆  H        μ   y  H    H    \mu(y,H)\subseteq H   or x belongs to $\mu(y,H)\subseteq H$ .
