Phenylalanine adenylyltransferase




Phenylalanine adenylyltransferase

In enzymology, a phenylalanine adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-phenylalanine 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + N-adenylyl-L-phenylalanine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-phenylalanine, whereas its two products are diphosphate and N-adenylyl-L-phenylalanine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:L-phenylalanine adenylyltransferase. This enzyme is also called L-phenylalanine adenylyltransferase.
