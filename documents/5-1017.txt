   Dilation (metric space)      Dilation (metric space)   In mathematics , a dilation is a function   f   f   f   from a metric space into itself that satisfies the identity       d   (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    =   r  d   (  x  ,  y  )          d     f  x     f  y       r  d   x  y      d(f(x),f(y))=rd(x,y)   for all points    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   , where    d   (  x  ,  y  )       d   x  y     d(x,y)   is the distance from   x   x   x   to   y   y   y   and   r   r   r   is some positive real number . 1  In Euclidean space , such a dilation is a similarity of the space. 2 Dilations change the size but not the shape of an object or figure.  Every dilation of a Euclidean space that is not a congruence has a unique fixed point 3 that is called the center of dilation. 4 Some congruences have fixed points and others do not. 5  See also   Homothety  Dilation (operator theory)   References  "  Category:Metric geometry     . ↩  .
