Dilation (metric space)

In mathematics, a dilation is a function 
 
 
 
  from a metric space into itself that satisfies the identity


 
  for all points 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the distance from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is some positive real number.1
In Euclidean space, such a dilation is a similarity of the space.2 Dilations change the size but not the shape of an object or figure.
Every dilation of a Euclidean space that is not a congruence has a unique fixed point3 that is called the center of dilation.4 Some congruences have fixed points and others do not.5
