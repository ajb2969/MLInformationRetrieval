   Normal-Wishart distribution      Normal-Wishart distribution   In probability theory and statistics , the normal-Wishart distribution (or Gaussian-Wishart distribution ) is a multivariate four-parameter family of continuous probability distributions . It is the conjugate prior of a multivariate normal distribution with unknown mean and precision matrix (the inverse of the covariance matrix ). 1  Definition  Suppose  $$\boldsymbol\mu|\boldsymbol\mu_0,\lambda,\boldsymbol\Lambda \sim \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu|\boldsymbol\mu_0,(\lambda\boldsymbol\Lambda)^{-1})$$ has a multivariate normal distribution with mean  $\boldsymbol\mu_0$ and covariance matrix  $(\lambda\boldsymbol\Lambda)^{-1}$ , where  $$\boldsymbol\Lambda|\mathbf{W},\nu \sim \mathcal{W}(\boldsymbol\Lambda|\mathbf{W},\nu)$$ has a Wishart distribution . Then $(\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Lambda)$ has a normal-Wishart distribution, denoted as  $$(\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Lambda) \sim \mathrm{NW}(\boldsymbol\mu_0,\lambda,\mathbf{W},\nu) .$$  Characterization  Probability density function  $$f(\boldsymbol\mu,\boldsymbol\Lambda|\boldsymbol\mu_0,\lambda,\mathbf{W},\nu) = \mathcal{N}(\boldsymbol\mu|\boldsymbol\mu_0,(\lambda\boldsymbol\Lambda)^{-1})\ \mathcal{W}(\boldsymbol\Lambda|\mathbf{W},\nu)$$  Properties  Scaling  Marginal distributions  By construction, the marginal distribution over $\boldsymbol\Lambda$ is a Wishart distribution , and the conditional distribution over $\boldsymbol\mu$ given $\boldsymbol\Lambda$ is a multivariate normal distribution . The marginal distribution over $\boldsymbol\mu$ is a multivariate t-distribution .  Posterior distribution of the parameters  Generating normal-Wishart random variates  Generation of random variates is straightforward:   Sample $\boldsymbol\Lambda$ from a Wishart distribution with parameters $\mathbf{W}$ and $\nu$  Sample $\boldsymbol\mu$ from a multivariate normal distribution with mean $\boldsymbol\mu_0$ and variance $(\lambda\boldsymbol\Lambda)^{-1}$   Related distributions   The normal-inverse Wishart distribution is essentially the same distribution parameterized by variance rather than precision.  The normal-gamma distribution is the one-dimensional equivalent.  The multivariate normal distribution and Wishart distribution are the component distributions out of which this distribution is made.   Notes  References   Bishop, Christopher M. (2006).
