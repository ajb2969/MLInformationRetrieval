In relational algebra, a rename is a unary operation written as 
 
 
 
  where:

  is an attribute of 
 
 


The result is identical to 
 
 
 
  except that the 
 
 
 
  attribute in all tuples is renamed to 
 
 
 
 . For an example, consider the following invocation of

Name

EmployeeId



Harry

3415



Sally

2241







EmployeeName

EmployeeId



Harry

3415



Sally

2241






Formally the semantics of the rename operator is defined as follows:

  with the 
 
 
 
  attribute renamed to
