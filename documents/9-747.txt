   Rename (relational algebra)      Rename (relational algebra)   In relational algebra , a rename is a unary operation written as     ρ   a  /  b     (  R  )        subscript  ρ    a  b    R    \rho_{a/b}(R)   where:      R   R   R   is a relation     a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are attribute names     b   b   b   is an attribute of   R   R   R      The result is identical to   R   R   R   except that the   b   b   b   attribute in all tuples is renamed to   a   a   a   . For an example, consider the following invocation of   ρ   ρ   \rho   on an    E  m  p  l  o  y  e  e      E  m  p  l  o  y  e  e    Employee   relation and the result of that invocation:          E  m  p  l  o  y  e  e      E  m  p  l  o  y  e  e    Employee           ρ     E  m  p  l  o  y  e  e  N  a  m  e   /  N   a  m  e     (   E  m  p  l  o  y  e  e   )        subscript  ρ        E  m  p  l  o  y  e  e  N  a  m  e   N   a  m  e      E  m  p  l  o  y  e  e     \rho_{EmployeeName/Name}(Employee)           Name   EmployeeId     Harry   3415     Sally   2241         EmployeeName   EmployeeId     Harry   3415     Sally   2241        Formally the semantics of the rename operator is defined as follows:        ρ   a  /  b     (  R  )    =   {   t   [   a  /  b   ]    :   t  ∈   R    }          subscript  ρ    a  b    R    conditional-set    t   delimited-[]    a  b       t  R      \rho_{a/b}(R)=\{\ t[a/b]:t\in R\ \}     where    t   [   a  /  b   ]       t   delimited-[]    a  b      t[a/b]   is defined as the tuple   t   t   t   with the   b   b   b   attribute renamed to   a   a   a   so that:       t   [   a  /  b   ]    =    {   (  c  ,  v  )   |     (  c  ,  v  )   ∈  t   ,   c  ≠   b     }   ∪   {   (  a  ,   t   (  b  )    )   }          t   delimited-[]    a  b        conditional-set   c  v    formulae-sequence     c  v   t     c  b       a    t  b        t[a/b]=\{\ (c,v)\ |\ (c,v)\in t,\ c\neq b\ \}\cup\{\ (a,\ t(b))\ \}   "  Category:Relational algebra
