Carnitine 3-dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a carnitine 3-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

carnitine + NAD+

 
  3-dehydrocarnitine + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are carnitine and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3-dehydrocarnitine, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carnitine:NAD+ 3-oxidoreductase.
