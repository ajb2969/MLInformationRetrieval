   Faddeeva function      Faddeeva function   The Faddeeva function or Kramp function is a scaled complex complementary error function ,        w   (  z  )    :=    e   -   z  2      erfc   (   -   i  z    )     =   erfcx   (   -   i  z    )    =    e   -   z  2      (   1  +     2  i    π      ∫  0  z     e   t  2    d  t      )     .       assign    w  z      superscript  e     superscript  z  2      erfc      i  z            erfcx      i  z             superscript  e     superscript  z  2       1        2  i     π      superscript   subscript   0   z      superscript  e   superscript  t  2    d  t          w(z):=e^{-z^{2}}\operatorname{erfc}(-iz)=\operatorname{erfcx}(-iz)=e^{-z^{2}}%
 \left(1+\frac{2i}{\sqrt{\pi}}\int_{0}^{z}e^{t^{2}}\text{d}t\right).   It is related to the Fresnel integral , to Dawson's integral , and to the Voigt function . The function also arises frequently in problems involving small-amplitude waves propagating through Maxwellian  plasmas , and in particular appears in the plasma's permittivity from which dispersion relations are derived, hence it is sometimes referred to as the plasma dispersion function 1 2 (although this name is sometimes used instead for the rescaled function     Z   (  z  )    =   i   π   w   (  z  )          Z  z     i    π   w  z     Z(z)=i\sqrt{\pi}w(z)   defined by Fried and Conte 3 4 ).  The function is also used in the analysis of electromagentic waves of the type used in AM radio. Groundwaves are verticaly polarised waves propagating over a lossy ground with finite resistivity and permittivity.  Properties  Real and imaginary parts  The decomposition into real and imaginary parts is usually written       w   (   x  +   i  y    )    =    V   (  x  ,  y  )    +   i  L   (  x  ,  y  )           w    x    i  y         V   x  y      i  L   x  y       w(x+iy)=V(x,y)+iL(x,y)   , where V and L are called the real and imaginary Voigt functions , since V(x,y) is the Voigt profile (up to prefactors).  History  The function was tabulated by Faddeeva and Terent'ev in 1954. 5 It appears as nameless function w(z) in Abramowitz and Stegun (1964), formula 7.1.3. The name Faddeeva function was apparently introduced by Poppe and Wijers in 1990; 6 previously, it was known as Kramp's function (probably after Christian Kramp ). 7  Early implementations used methods by Gautschi (1969/70; ACM Algorithm 363) 8 or by Humlicek (1982). 9 A more efficient algorithm was proposed by Poppe and Wijers (1990; ACM Algorithm 680). 10 Weideman (1994) proposed a particularly short algorithm that takes no more than eight lines of Matlab code. 11 Zaghloul and Ali pointed out deficiencies of previous algorithms and proposed a new one (2011; ACM Algorithm 916). 12 Another algorithm has been proposed by Abarov and Quine (2011/2012). 13  Implementations  Two software implementations, which are free for non-commercial use only 14 (and hence are not  Free and open-source software ), were published in ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software (TOMS) as Algorithm 680 (in Fortran , 15 later translated into C 16 ) and Algorithm 916 by Zaghloul and Ali (in MATLAB ). 17  Gnuplot incorporates a C implementation of the Humlicek algorithm, which is fast but relatively low precision. A free/open-source C++ implementation derived from a combination of Algorithm 680 and Algorithm 916 (using different algorithms for different z ) is also available under the MIT License . 18 This implementation is also available as a plug-in for Matlab, 19  GNU Octave , 20 and in Python via Scipy as scipy.special.wofz (which was originally the TOMS 680 code, but was replaced due to copyright concerns 21 ), and it has been packaged into a C library libcerf . 22  References  "  Category:Gaussian function  Category:Analytic functions     http://nlpc.stanford.edu/nleht/Science/reference/errorfun.pdf ↩    Richard Fitzpatrick , Plasma Dispersion Function , Plasma Physics lecture notes, University of Texas at Austin (2011/3/31). ↩  V.
