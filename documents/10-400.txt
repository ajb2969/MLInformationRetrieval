   Stokes' law of sound attenuation      Stokes' law of sound attenuation   Stokes law of sound attenuation is a formula for the attenuation of sound in a Newtonian fluid , such as water or air, due to the fluid's viscosity . It states that the amplitude of a plane wave decreases exponentially with distance traveled, at a rate   α   α   \alpha   given by      α  =    2  η   ω  2     3  ρ   V  3         α      2  η   superscript  ω  2      3  ρ   superscript  V  3       \alpha=\frac{2\eta\omega^{2}}{3\rho V^{3}}   where   η   η   \eta   is the dynamic viscosity coefficient of the fluid,   ω   ω   \omega   is the sound's frequency ,   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the fluid density , and   V   V   V   is the speed of sound in the medium: 1  The law and its derivation were published in 1845 by physicist G. G. Stokes , who also developed the well-known Stokes' law for the friction force in fluid motion.  Interpretation  Stokes' law applies to sound propagation in an isotropic and homogeneous Newtonian medium. Consider a plane sinusoidal  pressure wave that has amplitude    A  0     subscript  A  0    A_{0}   at some point. After traveling a distance   d   d   d   from that point, its amplitude    A   (  d  )       A  d    A(d)   will be       A   (  d  )    =    A  0    e   -   α  d            A  d      subscript  A  0    superscript  e      α  d        A(d)=A_{0}e^{-\alpha d}     The parameter   α   α   \alpha   is dimensionally the reciprocal of length. In the International System of Units (SI), it is expressed in neper per meter or simply reciprocal of meter (    m   -  1      superscript  normal-m    1     \mathrm{m}^{-1}   ). That is, if    α  =   1   m   -  1         α    1   superscript  normal-m    1       \alpha=1\mathrm{m}^{-1}   , the wave's amplitude decreases by a factor of    1  /  e      1  e    1/e   for each meter traveled.  Importance of volume viscosity  The law is amended to include a contribution by the volume viscosity     η  v     superscript  η  normal-v    \eta^{\mathrm{v}}   :      α  =    2   (   η  +    3   η  v    /  4    )    ω  2     3  ρ   V  3         α      2    η      3   superscript  η  normal-v    4     superscript  ω  2      3  ρ   superscript  V  3       \alpha=\frac{2(\eta+3\eta^{\mathrm{v}}/4)\omega^{2}}{3\rho V^{3}}   The volume viscosity coefficient is relevant when the fluid's compressibility cannot be ignored, such as in the case of ultrasound in water. 2 3 4 5 The volume viscosity of water at 15 C is 3.09 centipoise . 6  Modification for very high frequencies  Stokes's law is actually an asymptotic approximation for low frequencies of a more general formula:       2    (    α  V   ω   )   2    =    1    1  +    ω  2    τ  2       -   1   1  +    ω  2    τ  2             2   superscript      α  V   ω   2        1      1     superscript  ω  2    superscript  τ  2         1    1     superscript  ω  2    superscript  τ  2         2\left(\frac{\alpha V}{\omega}\right)^{2}=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\omega^{2}\tau^{2}}%
 }-\frac{1}{1+\omega^{2}\tau^{2}}   where the relaxation time    τ   τ   \tau   is given by:      τ  =      4  η   /  3   +   η  v     ρ   V  2         τ          4  η   3    superscript  η  normal-v      ρ   superscript  V  2       \tau=\frac{4\eta/3+\eta^{\mathrm{v}}}{\rho V^{2}}   The relaxation time is about     10   -  12    s       superscript  10    12    normal-s    10^{-12}\mathrm{s}   (one picosecond ), corresponding to a frequency of about 1000 GHz . Thus Stokes' law is adequate for most practical situations.  References    "  Category:Colloidal chemistry  Category:Fluid dynamics  Category:Acoustics     Stokes, G.G.
