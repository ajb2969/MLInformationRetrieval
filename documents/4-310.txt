   Clubsuit      Clubsuit   In mathematics , and particularly in axiomatic set theory , ♣ S ( clubsuit ) is a family of combinatorial principles that are weaker version of the corresponding ◊ S ; it was introduced in 1975 .  Definition  For a given cardinal number    κ   κ   \kappa   and a stationary set     S  ⊆  κ      S  κ    S\subseteq\kappa   ,    ♣  S     subscript  normal-♣  S    \clubsuit_{S}   is the statement that there is a sequence     ⟨    A  δ   :   δ  ∈  S    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   normal-:   subscript  A  δ     δ  S      \left\langle A_{\delta}:\delta\in S\right\rangle   such that   every A δ is a cofinal subset of δ  for every unbounded subset     A  ⊆  κ      A  κ    A\subseteq\kappa   , there is a   δ   δ   \delta   so that     A  δ   ⊆  A       subscript  A  δ   A    A_{\delta}\subseteq A          ♣   ω  1      subscript  normal-♣   subscript  ω  1     \clubsuit_{\omega_{1}}   is usually written as just   ♣   normal-♣   \clubsuit   .  ♣ and ◊  It is clear that ◊ ⇒ ♣, and it was shown in 1975 that ♣ + CH ⇒ ◊; however, Saharon Shelah gave a proof in 1980 that there exists a model of ♣ in which CH does not hold, so ♣ and ◊ are not equivalent (since ◊ ⇒ CH).
