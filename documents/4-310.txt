Clubsuit

In mathematics, and particularly in axiomatic set theory, ♣S (clubsuit) is a family of combinatorial principles that are weaker version of the corresponding ◊S; it was introduced in 1975 .
Definition
For a given cardinal number

 
  and a stationary set

 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the statement that there is a sequence

 
  such that

every Aδ is a cofinal subset of δ
for every unbounded subset

 
 , there is a 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 




 
  is usually written as just 
 
 
 
 .
♣ and ◊
It is clear that ◊ ⇒ ♣, and it was shown in 1975 that ♣ + CH ⇒ ◊; however, Saharon Shelah gave a proof in 1980 that there exists a model of ♣ in which CH does not hold, so ♣ and ◊ are not equivalent (since ◊ ⇒ CH).
