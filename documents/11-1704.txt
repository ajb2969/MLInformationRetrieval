   Conformal dimension      Conformal dimension   In mathematics, the conformal dimension of a metric space  X is the infimum of the Hausdorff dimension over the conformal gauge of X , that is, the class of all metric spaces quasisymmetric to X . 1  Formal definition  Let X be a metric space and   ùí¢   ùí¢   \mathcal{G}   be the collection of all metric spaces that are quasisymmetric to X . The conformal dimension of X is defined as such       Cdim  X   =    inf   Y  ‚àà  ùí¢      dim  H   Y          Cdim  X     subscript  infimum    Y  ùí¢      subscript  dimension  H   Y      \mathrm{Cdim}X=\inf_{Y\in\mathcal{G}}\dim_{H}Y     Properties  We have the following inequalities , for a metric space X :        dim  T   X   ‚â§   Cdim  X   ‚â§    dim  H   X           subscript  dimension  T   X     Cdim  X          subscript  dimension  H   X      \dim_{T}X\leq\mathrm{Cdim}X\leq\dim_{H}X     The second inequality is true by definition. The first one is deduced from the fact that the topological dimension T is invariant by homeomorphism , and thus can be defined as the infimum of the Hausdorff dimension over all spaces homeomorphic to X .  Examples   The conformal dimension of    ùêë  N     superscript  ùêë  N    \mathbf{R}^{N}   is N , since the topological and Hausdorff dimensions of Euclidean spaces agree.    The Cantor set  K is of null conformal dimension. However, there is no metric space quasisymmetric to K with a 0 Hausdorff dimension.
