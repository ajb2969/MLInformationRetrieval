   McCutcheon index      McCutcheon index   The McCutcheon index or chemotactic ratio is the ratio of the net displacement of a bacterium to the length of its actual path. 1 2       McCutcheon index  =   Displacement  Distance    .      McCutcheon index    Displacement  Distance     \text{McCutcheon index}={\text{Displacement}\over\text{Distance}}.     It is named after Morton McCutcheon who introduced it to describe chemotaxis in leukocytes .
