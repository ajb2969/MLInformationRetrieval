Sigma-ring

In mathematics, a nonempty collection of sets is called a σ-ring (pronounced sigma-ring) if it is closed under countable union and relative complementation.
Formal definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a nonempty collection of sets. Then 
 
 
 
  is a σ-ring if:



 
  if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 



 
  if 
 
 


Properties
From these two properties we immediately see that


 
  if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 

This is simply because 
 
 
 
 .
Similar concepts
If the first property is weakened to closure under finite union (i.e., 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
 ) but not countable union, then 
 
 
 
  is a ring but not a σ-ring.
Uses
σ-rings can be used instead of σ-fields (σ-algebras) in the development of measure and integration theory, if one does not wish to require that the universal set be measurable. Every σ-field is also a σ-ring, but a σ-ring need not be a σ-field.
A σ-ring 
 
 
 
  that is a collection of subsets of 
 
 
 
  induces a σ-field for 
 
 
 
 . Define 
 
 
 
  to be the collection of all subsets of 
 
 
 
  that are elements of 
 
 
 
  or whose complements are elements of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a σ-field over the set 
 
 
 
 . In fact 
 
 
 
  is the minimal σ-field containing 
 
 
 
  since it must be contained in every σ-field containing 
 
 
 
 .
