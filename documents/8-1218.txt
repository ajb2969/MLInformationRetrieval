   Sigma-ring      Sigma-ring   In mathematics , a nonempty collection of sets is called a σ-ring (pronounced sigma-ring ) if it is closed under countable union and relative complementation .  Formal definition  Let   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   be a nonempty collection of sets. Then   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   is a σ-ring if:         ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    ∈  ℛ        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n    ℛ    \bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in\mathcal{R}   if     A  n   ∈  ℛ       subscript  A  n   ℛ    A_{n}\in\mathcal{R}   for all    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}          A  ∖  B   ∈  ℛ        A  B   ℛ    A\setminus B\in\mathcal{R}   if     A  ,  B   ∈  ℛ       A  B   ℛ    A,B\in\mathcal{R}      Properties  From these two properties we immediately see that        ⋂   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    ∈  ℛ        superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n    ℛ    \bigcap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\in\mathcal{R}   if     A  n   ∈  ℛ       subscript  A  n   ℛ    A_{n}\in\mathcal{R}   for all    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}     This is simply because     ∩   n  =  1   ∞    A  n   =   A  1   ∖   ∪   n  =  1   ∞    (   A  1   ∖   A  n   )      fragments   superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n     subscript  A  1     superscript   subscript     n  1       fragments  normal-(   subscript  A  1     subscript  A  n   normal-)     \cap_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}=A_{1}\setminus\cup_{n=1}^{\infty}(A_{1}\setminus A_{n})   .  Similar concepts  If the first property is weakened to closure under finite union (i.e.,     A  ∪  B   ∈  ℛ        A  B   ℛ    A\cup B\in\mathcal{R}   whenever     A  ,  B   ∈  ℛ       A  B   ℛ    A,B\in\mathcal{R}   ) but not countable union, then   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   is a ring but not a σ-ring.  Uses  σ-rings can be used instead of σ-fields (σ-algebras) in the development of measure and integration theory, if one does not wish to require that the universal set be measurable. Every σ-field is also a σ-ring, but a σ-ring need not be a σ-field.  A σ-ring   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   that is a collection of subsets of   X   X   X   induces a σ-field for   X   X   X   . Define   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   to be the collection of all subsets of   X   X   X   that are elements of   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   or whose complements are elements of   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   . Then   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is a σ-field over the set   X   X   X   . In fact   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is the minimal σ-field containing   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   since it must be contained in every σ-field containing   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   .
