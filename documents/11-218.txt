L-arabinonate dehydratase

In enzymology, a L-arabinonate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-arabinonate 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-arabinonate, and two products, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arabinonate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-arabinonate-forming). Other names in common use include L-arabonate dehydrase, L-arabonate dehydratase, and L-arabinonate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
