   Isovitexin beta-glucosyltransferase      Isovitexin beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , an isovitexin beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + isovitexin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + isovitexin 2"-O-beta-D-glucoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and isovitexin , whereas its two products are UDP and isovitexin 2"-O-beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:isovitexin 2"-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called uridine diphosphoglucose-isovitexin 2"-glucosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
