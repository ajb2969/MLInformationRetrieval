   U-rank      U-rank   In model theory , a branch of mathematical logic, U-rank is one measure of the complexity of a (complete) type, in the context of stable theories . As usual, higher U-rank indicates less restriction, and the existence of a U-rank for all types over all sets is equivalent to an important model-theoretic condition: in this case, superstability .  Definition  U-rank is defined inductively, as follows, for any (complete) n-type p over any set A:   U ( p ) ≥ 0  If δ is a limit ordinal, then U ( p ) ≥ δ precisely when U ( p ) ≥ α for all α less than δ  For any α = β + 1, U ( p ) ≥ α precisely when there is a forking extension q of p with U ( q ) ≥ β   We say that U ( p ) = α when the U ( p ) ≥ α but not U ( p ) ≥ α + 1.  If U ( p ) ≥ α for all ordinals α , we say the U-rank is unbounded, or U ( p ) = ∞.  Note: U-rank is formally denoted     U  n    (  p  )        subscript  U  n   p    U_{n}(p)   , where p is really p(x), and x is a tuple of variables of length n. This subscript is typically omitted when no confusion can result.  Ranking theories  U-rank is monotone in its domain. That is, suppose p is a complete type over A and B is a subset of A . Then for q the restriction of p to B , U ( q ) ≥ U ( p ).  If we take B (above) to be empty, then we get the following: if there is an n -type p , over some set of parameters, with rank at least α , then there is a type over the empty set of rank at least α . Thus, we can define, for a complete (stable) theory T ,      U  n    (  T  )    =   sup   {    U  n    (  p  )    :   p  ∈   S   (  T  )     }           subscript  U  n   T    supremum   conditional-set     subscript  U  n   p     p    S  T        U_{n}(T)=\sup\{U_{n}(p):p\in S(T)\}   .  We then get a concise characterization of superstability; a stable theory T is superstable if and only if      U  n    (  T  )    <  ∞         subscript  U  n   T      U_{n}(T)<\infty   for every n .  Properties   As noted above, U-rank is monotone in its domain.  If p has U-rank α , then for any β < α , there is a forking extension q of p with U-rank β .  If p is the type of b over A , there is some set B extending A , with q the type of b over B .  If p is unranked (that is, p has U-rank ∞), then there is a forking extension q of p which is also unranked.  Even in the absence of superstability, there is an ordinal β which is the maximum rank of all ranked types, and for any α < β , there is a type p of rank α , and if the rank of p is greater than β , then it must be ∞.   Examples   U ( p ) > 0 precisely when p is nonalgebraic.  If T is the theory of algebraically closed fields (of any fixed characteristic) then      U  1    (  T  )    =  1         subscript  U  1   T   1    U_{1}(T)=1   . Further, if A is any set of parameters and K is the field generated by A , then a 1-type p over A has rank 1 if (all realizations of) p are transcendental over K , and 0 otherwise. More generally, an n -type p over A has U-rank k , the transcendence degree (over K ) of any realization of it.   References  "
