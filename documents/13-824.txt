   Wallis's conical edge      Wallis's conical edge     ''' Wallis's conical edge ''' is a ruled surface given by the parametric equations:  $$x=v\cos u,\quad y=v\sin u,\quad z=c\sqrt{a^2-b^2\cos^2u}.\,$$  where a , b and c are constants.  Wallis's conical edge is also a kind of right conoid .  Figure 2 shows that the Wallis's conical edge is generated by a moving line.  Wallis's conical edge is named after the English mathematician John Wallis , who was one of the first to use Cartesian methods to study conic sections .[ http://books.google.com/books?id=owEj9TMYo7IC&pg ;=PA450&lpg=PA450&dq=John+Wallis+%22conical+edge%22&source=bl&ots=j591Txb0Li&sig=GqlLD5QzHjtZwm67hVaDILWBoUE&hl=en&ei=kG5uSpWFHqj26gOD-Ky5BA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1]  See also   Ruled surface  Right conoid   External links   Wallis's Conical Edge from MathWorld.
