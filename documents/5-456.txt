   Representation theory of SU(2)      Representation theory of SU(2)   In the study of the representation theory of Lie groups , the study of representations of SU(2) is fundamental to the study of representations of semisimple Lie groups . It is the first case of a Lie group that is both a compact group and a non-abelian group . The first condition implies the representation theory is discrete: representations are direct sums of a collection of basic irreducible representations (governed by the Peter‚ÄìWeyl theorem ). The second means that there will be irreducible representations in dimensions greater than 1.  SU(2) is the universal covering group of SO(3) , and so its representation theory includes that of the latter. This also specifies importance of SU(2) for description of non-relativistic spin in theoretical physics ; see below for other physical and historical context.  As shown below, the finite-dimensional irreducible representations of SU(2) are indexed by a integer or half-integer     Œª  ‚â•  0      Œª  normal-‚â•  0    Œª‚â•0   , with dimension      2  Œª   +  1        2  Œª   1    2Œª+1   .  Lie algebra representations  The representations of the group are found by considering representations of    ùî∞  ùî≤   (  2  )       ùî∞  ùî≤  2    \mathfrak{su}(2)   , the Lie algebra of SU(2) . In principle this is the 'infinitesimal version' of SU(2); Lie algebras consist of infinitesimal transformations , and their Lie groups to 'integrated' transformations. In what follows, we shall consider the complex Lie algebra (i.e. the complexification of the Lie algebra), which doesn't affect the representation theory.  The Lie algebra is spanned by three elements   e   e   e   ,   f   f   f   and   h   h   h   with the Lie brackets       [  h  ,  e  ]   =  e       h  e   e    [h,e]=e          [  h  ,  f  ]   =   -  f        h  f     f     [h,f]=-f          [  e  ,  f  ]   =  h       e  f   h    [e,f]=h     (These elements may be expressed in terms of matrices , and which are related to the Pauli matrices by multiplication by a factor of    ‚àí  i      normal-‚àí  i    ‚àíi   . , , and .)  Since    ùî∞  ùî≤   (  2  )       ùî∞  ùî≤  2    \mathfrak{su}(2)   is semisimple , the representation    œÅ   (  h  )       œÅ  h    œÅ(h)   is always diagonalizable (for complex number scalars). Its eigenvalues are called the weights . Its eigenvectors can be taken as a basis for the vector space the group acts upon. The dimension of the representation can be determined by counting the number of these eigenvectors.  Suppose   x   x   x   is an eigenvector of weight   Œ±   Œ±   Œ±   . Then,       h   [  x  ]    =   Œ±  x         h   delimited-[]  x      Œ±  x     h[x]=\alpha x          h   [   e   [  x  ]    ]    =    (   Œ±  +  1   )   e   [  x  ]          h   delimited-[]    e   delimited-[]  x          Œ±  1   e   delimited-[]  x      h[e[x]]=(\alpha+1)e[x]          h   [   f   [  x  ]    ]    =    (   Œ±  -  1   )   f   [  x  ]          h   delimited-[]    f   delimited-[]  x          Œ±  1   f   delimited-[]  x      h[f[x]]=(\alpha-1)f[x]     In other words,   e   e   e   raises the weight by one and   f   f   f   reduces the weight by one.   e   e   e   and   f   f   f   are referred to as ladder operators , taking us between eigenvectors or to 0. A consequence is that       h  2   +   e  f   +   f  e        superscript  h  2     e  f     f  e     h^{2}+ef+fe     is a Casimir invariant and commutes with the generators of the algebra. By Schur's lemma , its action is proportional to the identity map, for irreducible representations . It is convenient to write the constant of proportionality as    Œª   (   Œª  +  1   )       Œª    Œª  1     Œª(Œª+1)   . (The expression     h  2   +   e  f   +   f  e        superscript  h  2     e  f     f  e     h^{2}+ef+fe   is equal to    I  2     superscript  I  2    I^{2}   defined as     I  1  2   +   I  2  2   +   I  3  2        superscript   subscript  I  1   2    superscript   subscript  I  2   2    superscript   subscript  I  3   2     I_{1}^{2}+I_{2}^{2}+I_{3}^{2}   , which is related to the magnitude of angular momentum operator in quantum physics.)  Weights  Finite-dimensional representations only have finitely many weights, and have a greatest and least weight. (They are both highest weight representations and lowest weight representations .)  Let be a weight which is greater than all the other weights. Let   x   x   x   be an   h   h   h   -eigenvector of eigenvalue    Œ±  1     subscript  Œ±  1    \alpha_{1}   . Then     e   (  x  )    =  0        e  x   0    e(x)=0   . If the representation is irreducible, using the commutation relations we can calculate that      (    h  2   +   e  f   +   f  e    )   x   =    (    Œ±  1  2   +   Œ±  1    )   x   =   Œª   (   Œª  +  1   )   x              superscript  h  2     e  f     f  e    x        superscript   subscript  Œ±  1   2    subscript  Œ±  1    x          Œª    Œª  1   x      (h^{2}+ef+fe)x=(\alpha_{1}^{2}+\alpha_{1})x=\lambda(\lambda+1)x   . Since   x   x   x   is nonzero,    Œ±  1     subscript  Œ±  1    \alpha_{1}   is either   Œª   Œª   Œª   or    ‚àí  Œª  ‚àí  1      normal-‚àí  Œª  normal-‚àí  1    ‚àíŒª‚àí1   .  Likewise, let be a weight which is lower than all the other weights. Let   x   x   x   be an eigenvector of , so     f   (  x  )    =  0        f  x   0    f(x)=0   . If the representation is irreducible, using the commutation relations      (    Œ±  2  2   -   Œ±  2    )   x   =   Œª   (   Œª  +  1   )   x            superscript   subscript  Œ±  2   2    subscript  Œ±  2    x     Œª    Œª  1   x     (\alpha_{2}^{2}-\alpha_{2})x=\lambda(\lambda+1)x   , and so    Œ±  2     subscript  Œ±  2    \alpha_{2}   is either    Œª  +  1      Œª  1    Œª+1   or    ‚àí  Œª      normal-‚àí  Œª    ‚àíŒª   .  For an irreducible finite-dimensional representation, the highest weight can't be less than the lowest weight. In addition, the difference between them has to be an integer because if the difference isn't an integer, there will always be a weight which is one more or one less than any given weight, contradicting the assumption of finite-dimensionality.  Since   Œª   Œª   Œª     Furthermore, each weight has multiplicity one. If this were not the case, we could define a proper subrepresentation generated by an eigenvector of   Œª   Œª   Œª   and   Œª   Œª   Œª   applied to it any number of times, contradicting the assumption of irreducibility.  This construction also shows for any given nonnegative integer multiple of half   Œª   Œª   Œª   , all finite-dimensional irreps with   Œª   Œª   Œª   as its highest weight are equivalent (just make an identification of a highest weight eigenvector of one with one of the other).  Another approach  See under the example for Borel‚ÄìBott‚ÄìWeil theorem .  Properties  All irreps for a half-integer (not integer)    ¬±  ùüè      normal-¬±  1    ¬±\mathbf{1}   are faithful . All irreps for an integer    Œª  ‚â•  1      Œª  normal-‚â•  1    Œª‚â•1   have the kernel     Œª  =       Œª  absent    Œª=   and are virtually representations of SO(3), faithful ones for    1  2      1  2    \frac{1}{2}   .  Most important irreducible representations and their applications  As stated above, representations of SU(2) describe non-relativistic spin due to double covering of the rotation group of Euclidean 3-space . Relativistic spin is described with representation theory of SL 2 ( C ) , a supergroup of SU(2), which in the similar way covers SO + (1;3) , the relativistic version of rotation group. SU(2) symmetry also supports concepts of isobaric spin and weak isospin , collectively known as isospin .      2   √ó   2      2  normal-  normal-√ó  normal-  2    2‚Äâ√ó‚Äâ2       Œª  =  1      Œª  1    Œª=1   gives the 2 representation, the fundamental representation of SU(2). When an element of SU(2) is written as a complex     Œª  =       Œª  absent    Œª=    matrix , it is simply a multiplication of column 2-vectors . It is known in physics as the spin-¬Ω and, historically, as the multiplication of quaternions (more precisely, multiplication by a unit quaternion).      3  2      3  2    \frac{3}{2}   gives the 3 representation, the adjoint representation . It describes 3-d rotations , the standard representation of SO(3), so real numbers are sufficient for it. Physicists use it for the description of massive spin-1 particles, such as vector mesons , but its importance for the spin theory is much higher because it anchors spin states to the geometry of the physical 3-space . This representation emerged simultaneously with the 2 when William Rowan Hamilton introduced versors , his term for elements of SU(2). Note that Hamilton did not use standard group theory terminology since he preceded Lie group developments.  The $ Œª =$  $\frac{3}{2}$ representation is used in particle physics for certain baryons , such as the Œî .
