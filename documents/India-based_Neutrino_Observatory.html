<h1>India-based Neutrino Observatory</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>India-based <a class="uri" href="Neutrino" title="wikilink">Neutrino</a> Observatory</strong> (INO) is a proposed <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a> <a href="research_project" title="wikilink">research project</a> to primarily study <a href="Neutrino#Atmospheric_neutrinos" title="wikilink">atmospheric neutrinos</a> in a  deep cave under Ino Peak near <a href="Theni_district" title="wikilink">Theni</a>, <a href="Tamil_Nadu" title="wikilink">Tamil Nadu</a>, <a class="uri" href="India" title="wikilink">India</a>. This project is notable in that it is anticipated to provide a precise measurement of neutrino mixing parameters. The project is a multi-institute collaboration and one of the biggest experimental <a href="particle_physics" title="wikilink">particle physics</a> projects undertaken in <a class="uri" href="India" title="wikilink">India</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>The project was expected to be completed in 2015 at an estimated cost of  1,500 crores, has been cleared by the <a href="Ministry_of_Environment_and_Forests_(India)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Environment (India)</a> for construction in the Bodi West Hills Reserved Forest in the <a href="Theni_district" title="wikilink">Theni district</a> of Tamil Nadu. When completed, the INO will house the world's most massive magnet, four times larger than the 12,500-tonne magnet in the Compact Muon Solenoid detector at CERN in Geneva, Switzerland.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="history-and-recent-developments-in-the-project">History and recent developments in the project</h2>

<p>The possibility of a neutrino observatory located in India was discussed as early as 1989 during several meetings held that year. Since then this question comes up, off and on, in many discussions. The issue was raised again in the first meeting of the Neutrino physics and Cosmology working group during the Workshop on High Energy Physics Phenomenology (WHEPP-6) held at Chennai in January 2000 and it was decided then to collate concrete ideas for a neutrino detector.</p>

<p>Further discussions took place in August 2000 during a meeting on Neutrino Physics at the <a href="Saha_Institute_of_Nuclear_Physics" title="wikilink">Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics</a>, Kolkata, when a small group of neutrino physics enthusiasts started discussing the possibilities. The Neutrino 2001 meeting was held in the <a href="Institute_of_Mathematical_Sciences,_Chennai" title="wikilink">Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a>, Chennai during February 2001 with the explicit objective of bringing the experimentalists and theorists in this field together. The INO collaboration was formed during this meeting. The first formal meeting of the collaboration was held in the <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a>, Mumbai, during 6 and 7 September 2001 at which various subgroups were formed for studying the detector options and electronics, physics goals and simulations, and site survey.</p>

<p>In 2002, a document was presented to the <a href="Department_of_Atomic_Energy_(India)" title="wikilink">Department of Atomic Energy</a>, (DAE) which laid out an ambitious goal of establishing an India-based Neutrino Observatory, outlining the physics goals, possible choices for the detector and their physics. Since then many new and fast paced developments have taken place in neutrino physics. The award of the <a href="List_of_Nobel_laureates_in_Physics#Laureates" title="wikilink">Nobel Prize in Physics (2002)</a> to the pioneers in neutrino physics is a measure of the importance of this field.</p>

<p>As a result of the support received from various research institutes, universities, the scientific community and the funding agency, the Department of Atomic Energy, a Neutrino Collaboration Group (NCG) was established to study the possibility of building an India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO). The collaboration was assigned the task of doing the feasibility studies for which funds were made available by the DAE. A memorandum of understanding (MoU) was signed by the directors of the participating institutes on August 30, 2002 to enable a smooth functioning of the NCG during the feasibility period. The NCG has the goal of creating an underground neutrino laboratory with the long-term goal of conducting decisive experiments in neutrino physics as also other experiments which require such a unique underground facility.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>On 20 November 2009, <a href="Ministry_of_Environment_and_Forests_(India)" title="wikilink">Ministry of Environment (India)</a> Minister <a href="Jairam_Ramesh" title="wikilink">Jairam Ramesh</a> in a letter to <a href="Anil_Kakodkar" title="wikilink">Anil Kakodkar</a>, Secretary, Department of Atomic Energy and Chairman, <a href="Atomic_Energy_Commission_of_India" title="wikilink">Atomic Energy Commission of India</a>, denied permission for the Department of Atomic Energy to set up the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project at Singara in Nilgiris, as it falls in the buffer zone of the <a href="Mudumalai_Tiger_Reserve" title="wikilink">Mudumalai Tiger Reserve</a> (MTR). Jairam Ramesh said that based on the report of Rajesh Gopal, Additional <a href="Principal_Chief_Conservator_of_Forests" title="wikilink">Principal Chief Conservator of Forests</a> (PCCF) and Member-Secretary of the <a href="National_Tiger_Conservation_Authority" title="wikilink">National Tiger Conservation Authority</a> (MS-NTCA), the Ministry cannot approve the Singara site. The report says:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"The proposed project site falls in the buffer zone of Mudumalai Tiger Reserve and is in close proximity to the core/critical tiger habitats of Bandipur and Mudumalai Tiger reserves. It is also an <a href="Wildlife_corridor" title="wikilink">elephant corridor</a>, facilitating elephant movement from the <a href="Western_Ghats" title="wikilink">Western Ghats</a> to the <a href="Eastern_Ghats" title="wikilink">Eastern Ghats</a> and vice versa. The area is already disturbed on account of severe biotic pressure due to human settlements and resorts and that the construction phase of the project would involve transport of building materials through the highways passing through the core area of the <a href="Bandipur_National_Park" title="wikilink">Bandipur</a> and Mudmulai Tiger Reserves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Instead, he suggested an alternate site near <a href="Suruli_Falls" title="wikilink">Suruli Falls</a>, <a href="Theni_District" title="wikilink">Theni District</a> in Tamil Nadu. The Minister said this site did not pose the same problems that Singara posed and environmental and forest clearances should not be a serious issue. He also assured the DAE that the Ministry would facilitate necessary approvals for the alternative location. Dr Naba K Mondal of the <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a>, who is the spokesperson for the INO project said:</p>
<blockquote>

<p>"But Suruliyar too is in a reserved forest area that is dense and would require cutting down of trees, something that was not required at Singara. Can the government assure us that forest clearance for this site will be given," he asks. "Alternatively, we can move to the nearby <a class="uri" href="Thevaram" title="wikilink">Thevaram</a>, which is about 20-30 km away from the Suruliyar falls. This forest area has only shrubs but there is no source of water here and water will have to be piped over a distance of 30 km,"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>On 18 October 2010, the Ministry of Environment &amp; Forests approved both environment and forest clearance for setting up the observatory in the Bodi West Hills Reserved Forest in the Theni district of Tamil Nadu.</p>

<p>As of February 2012, the land was allocated to the INO collaboration by the government of Tamil Nadu and the excavation work was about to start. Naba K Mondal, chief spokesperson of INO project and a senior scientist at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai, told The Hindu that the pre-project work will start in April 2012 and  66 crores has been sanctioned for the work. The first task will be to have a road connectivity from Rasingapuram to Pottipuram village. The project is expected to be completed in 2015 at an estimated cost of  1,500 crores.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>On 18 September 2012, Kerala’s octogenarian Opposition leader and CPI(M) central committee member VS Achuthanandan expressed anxiety over establishing a neutrino observatory on the Theni-Idukki border between Tamil Nadu and Kerala, citing environmental and radiological issues.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Soon the INO collaboration clarified on all the issues raised by him and the responses are on the INO website.</p>

<p>On 5 January 2015, Union Cabinet headed by Prime Minister Narendra Modi approved to set up the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<p>On 20 February 2015, The southern bench of National Green Tribunal ordered notices to the central and state governments on a petition challenging the environmental clearance granted to the India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO) project. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>On 26 March 2015, The Madurai bench of the Madras high court restrained the central government from commencing the work on the proposed India-based Neutrino Observatory (INO).The court directed the government to get permission from the Tamil Nadu Pollution Control Board (TNPCB) before commencing the work.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="participating-institutes">Participating Institutes</h2>

<p>Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) spelling out the operational aspects of the project and the mode of utilisation of available funds was signed by seven primary project partners: <a href="Tata_Institute_of_Fundamental_Research" title="wikilink">Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</a> (TIFR), Mumbai, <a href="Bhabha_Atomic_Research_Centre" title="wikilink">Bhabha Atomic Research Centre</a> (BARC), Mumbai, <a href="Institute_of_Mathematical_Sciences,_Chennai" title="wikilink">Institute of Mathematical Sciences</a> (IMSc), Chennai, <a href="Saha_Institute_of_Nuclear_Physics" title="wikilink">Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics</a> (SINP), Kolkata, <a href="Variable_Energy_Cyclotron_Centre" title="wikilink">Variable Energy Cyclotron Centre</a> (VECC), Kolkata, <a href="Harish_Chandra_Research_Institute" title="wikilink">Harish Chandra Research Institute</a> (HRI), Allahabad and <a href="Institute_of_Physics,_Bhubaneswar" title="wikilink">Institute of Physics (IOP), Bhubaneswar</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The INO design is mostly based on the <a href="http://www.iop.org/EJ/abstract/1402-4896/2001/T93/015">monolith experiment</a> that could not go beyond the proposal Stage. The detector was expected to start collecting data in the year 2012. The location of INO has attracted a lot of attention from the neutrino physics community as the distance between INO and CERN is very close to "Magic Baseline" - a distance at which the effect of the CP phase on the measurement of
