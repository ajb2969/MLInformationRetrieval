Isocitrate epimerase

In enzymology, an isocitrate epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(1R,2S)-1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate 
 
 
 
  (1S,2S)-1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (1R,2S)-1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate, and one product, (1S,2S)-1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on hydroxy acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1R,2S)-1-hydroxypropane-1,2,3-tricarboxylate 1-epimerase.
