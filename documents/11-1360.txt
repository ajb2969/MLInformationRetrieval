Raffinose—raffinose alpha-galactosyltransferase

In enzymology, a raffinose-raffinose alpha-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 raffinose 
 
 
 
  1F-alpha-D-galactosylraffinose + sucrose
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, raffinose, and two products, 1F-alpha-D-galactosylraffinose and sucrose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, to be specific the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is raffinose:raffinose alpha-D-galactosyltransferase. Other names in common use include raffinose (raffinose donor) galactosyltransferase, raffinose:raffinose alpha-galactosyltransferase, and raffinose-raffinose alpha-galactotransferase.
