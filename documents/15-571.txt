   NGC 6166      NGC 6166    NGC 6166 is an elliptical galaxy in the Abell 2199 cluster. It lies 490 million light years away in the constellation Hercules . The primary galaxy in the cluster is one of the most luminous galaxies known in terms of X-ray emissions. 1  Description  NGC 6166 is a supermassive, type cD galaxy and one fine example of this type of galaxy, with several smaller galaxies within its envelope. 2  It is suspected to have formed through a number of galaxy collisions. It has a large number of globular clusters (between 6,200-22,000) 3 orbiting the galaxy. 4  The galaxy harbors a supermassive black hole at its center with a mass of 1 billion       M  ⊙          subscript  M  direct-product      \begin{smallmatrix}M_{\odot}\end{smallmatrix}   . 5  NGC 6166 is known to host an active nucleus , classified as an FR I source , which powers two symmetric parsec-scale radio jets and radio lobes and it is caused by the infall of gas into its center caused by a cooling flow that deposits 200 solar masses of gas every year there. 6  It has been proposed that a number of O-type stars may be present in the center of NGC 6166 7  See also   Abell 2199  List of galaxies   References  "  2199  Category:Active galaxies  Category:Hercules (constellation)  Category:Radio galaxies     ↩  [ http://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/cgi-bin/nph-datasearch?search_type=Note_id&objid; ;=57565&objname;=NGC%206166&img;_stamp=YES&hconst;=73.0&omegam;=0.27&omegav;=0.73&corr;_z=1&of;=table Notes for object NGC 6166 (NED)] ↩  ↩  http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1990ApJ ...355..410P ↩  ↩   ↩
