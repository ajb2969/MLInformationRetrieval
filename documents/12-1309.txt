K-Poincaré group

In physics and mathematics, the κ-Poincaré group, named after Henri Poincaré, is a quantum group, obtained by deformation of the Poincaré group into an Hopf algebra. It is generated by the elements 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with the usual constraint:


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the Minkowskian metric:



The commutation rules reads:








In the (1 + 1)-dimensional case the commutation rules between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are particularly simple. The Lorentz generator in this case is:



and the commutation rules reads:








The coproducts are classical, and encode the group composition law:








Also the antipodes and the counits are classical, and represent the group inversion law and the map to the identity:














The κ-Poincaré group is the dual Hopf algebra to the K-Poincaré algebra, and can be interpreted as its “finite” version.
