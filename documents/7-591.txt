In computer science, a type class is a type system construct that supports ad hoc polymorphism. This is achieved by adding constraints to type variables in parametrically polymorphic types. Such a constraint typically involves a type class T and a type variable a, and means that a can only be instantiated to a type whose members support the overloaded operations associated with T.
Type classes first appeared in the Haskell programming language,1 and were originally conceived as a way of implementing overloaded arithmetic and equality operators in a principled fashion.23 In contrast with the "eqtypes" of Standard ML, overloading the equality operator through the use of type classes in Haskell does not require extensive modification of the compiler frontend or the underlying type system.4
Since their creation, many other applications of type classes have been discovered.
Overview
The programmer defines a type class by specifying a set of function or constant names, together with their respective types, that must exist for every type that belongs to the class. In Haskell, types can be parameterized; a type class Eq intended to contain types that admit equality would be declared in the following way:
class Eq a where
   (==) :: a -> a -> Bool
   (/=) :: a -> a -> Bool
This declaration may be read as stating a "type a belongs to type class Eq if there are functions named (==), and (/=), of the appropriate types, defined on it." A programmer could then define a function member in the following way:
member :: (Eq a) => a -> [a] -> Bool
 member y [] = False
 member y (x:xs) = (x == y) || member y xs
The function member has the type a -> [a] -> Bool with the context (Eq a), which constrains the types which a can range over to those a which belong to the Eq type class. (Note: Haskell  =>  can be called a 'class constraint'.)
A programmer can make any type t a member of a given type class C by using an instance declaration that defines implementations of all of C's methods for the particular type t. For instance, if a programmer defines a new data type t, they may then make this new type an instance of Eq by providing an equality function over values of type t in whatever way they see fit. Once they have done this, they may use the function member on [t], that is, lists of elements of type t.
Note that type classes are different from classes in object-oriented programming languages. In particular, Eq is not a type: there is no such thing as a value of type Eq.
Type classes are closely related to parametric polymorphism. For example, note that the type of member as specified above would be the parametrically polymorphic type a -> [a] -> Bool were it not for the type class constraint "(Eq a) =>".
Higher-kinded polymorphism
A type class need not take a type variable of kind

 
 , but can take one of any kind. These type classes with higher kinds are sometimes called constructor classes (the constructors referred to are type constructors such as Maybe, rather than data constructors such as Just). An example is the monad class:
 class Monad m where
    (>>=) :: m a -> (a -> m b) -> m b
    return :: a -> m a
The fact that m is applied to a type variable indicates that it has kind * -> *, i.e. it takes a type and returns a type.
Multi-parameter type classes
Type classes permit multiple type parameters, and so type classes can be seen as relations on types.5 For example, in the GHC standard library, the class IArray expresses a general immutable array interface. In this class, the type class constraint IArray a e means that a is an array type that contains elements of type e. (This restriction on polymorphism is used to implement unboxed array types, for example.)
Like multimethods, multi-parameter type classes support calling different implementations of a method depending on the types of multiple arguments, and indeed return types. They are more efficient than multimethods because they do not involve searching for the method to call on every call at runtime: the method to call is stored in the dictionary of the type class instance, just as with single-parameter type classes.
Haskell code that uses multi-parameter type classes is not portable, as this feature is not part of the Haskell 98 standard. The popular Haskell implementations, GHC and Hugs, support multi-parameter type classes.
Functional dependencies
In Haskell, type classes have been refined to allow the programmer to declare functional dependencies between type parameters—a concept inspired from relational database theory.67 That is, the programmer can assert that a given assignment of some subset of the type parameters uniquely determines the remaining type parameters. For example, general monads m which carry a state parameter of type s satisfy the type class constraint MonadState s m. In this constraint, there is a functional dependency m -> s. This means that for a given monad, the state type accessible from this interface is uniquely determined. This aids the compiler in type inference, as well as aiding the programmer in type-directed programming.
Simon Peyton-Jones has objected to the introduction of functional dependencies in Haskell on grounds of complexity.8
Type class instances as implicit parameters
Implicit parameters used to implement type classes
Scala supports type classes whose instances or "dictionaries" are just ordinary values in the language, rather than a completely separate kind of entity.910 While these instances are by default supplied by finding appropriate instances in scope to be used as the implicit actual parameters for explicitly-declared implicit formal parameters, the fact that they are ordinary values means that they can be supplied explicitly, to resolve ambiguity. This can be used to avoid issues such as incoherent and inconsistent instances that can occur when doing advanced Haskell development. Coq (version 8.2 onwards) also supports type classes by inferring the appropriate instances.11 Recent versions of Agda 2 also provide a similar feature, called "instance arguments".12
Other approaches to operator overloading
In Standard ML, the mechanism of "equality types" corresponds roughly to Haskell's built-in type class Eq, but all equality operators are derived automatically by the compiler. The programmer's control of the process is limited to designating which type components in a structure are equality types and which type variables in a polymorphic type range over equality types.
SML's and OCaml's modules and functors can play a role similar to that of Haskell's type classes, the principal difference being the role of type inference, which makes type classes suitable for ad hoc polymorphism.13 The object oriented subset of OCaml is yet another approach which is somewhat comparable to the one of type classes.
Related notions
An analogous notion for overloaded data (implemented in GHC) is that of type family.14
