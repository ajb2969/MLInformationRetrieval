Splitting lemma (functions)


See also splitting lemma in homological algebra.


In mathematics, especially in singularity theory the splitting lemma is a useful result due to Ren√© Thom which provides a way of simplifying the local expression of a function usually applied in a neighbourhood of a degenerate critical point.
Formal statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a smooth function germ, with a critical point at 0 (so 
 
 
 
 ). Let V be a subspace of 
 
 
 
  such that the restriction f|V is non-degenerate, and write B for the Hessian matrix of this restriction. Let W be any complementary subspace to V. Then there is a change of coordinates 
 
 
 
 
  of the form 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , and a smooth function h on W such that



This result is often referred to as the parametrized Morse lemma, which can be seen by viewing y as the parameter. It is the gradient version of the implicit function theorem.
Extensions
There are extensions to infinite dimensions, to complex analytic functions, to functions invariant under the action of a compact group, . . .
