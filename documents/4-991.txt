   Incompressible surface      Incompressible surface   In mathematics , an incompressible surface , in intuitive terms, is a surface , embedded in a 3-manifold , which has been simplified as much as possible while remaining "nontrivial" inside the 3-manifold.  For a precise definition, suppose that S is a compact surface  properly embedded in a 3-manifold M . Suppose that D is a disk , also embedded in M , with        D  ∩  S   =   ∂  D    .        D  S     D     D\cap S=\partial\!D.     Suppose finally that the curve    ∂  D      D    \partial\!D   in S does not bound a disk inside of S . Then D is called a compressing disk for S and we also call S a compressible surface in M . If no such disk exists and S is not the 2-sphere , then we call S  incompressible (or geometrically incompressible ).  Note that we must exclude the 2-sphere to get any interesting consequences for the 3-manifold. Every 3-manifold has many embedded 2-spheres, and a 2-sphere embedded in a 3-manifold never has a compressing disc.  Sometimes one defines an incompressible sphere to be a 2-sphere in a 3-manifold that does not bound a 3-ball. Thus, such a sphere either does not separate the 3-manifold or gives a nontrivial connected sum decomposition. Since this notion of incompressibility for a sphere is quite different from the above definition for surfaces, often an incompressible sphere is instead referred to as an essential sphere or reducing sphere .  There is also an algebraic version of incompressibility: Suppose    ι  :   S  →  M      normal-:  ι   normal-→  S  M     \iota:S\rightarrow M   is a proper embedding of a compact surface. Then S is     π  1     subscript  π  1    \pi_{1}   -injective (or algebraically incompressible ) if the induced map on fundamental groups       ι  ⋆   :     π  1    (  S  )    →    π  1    (  M  )        normal-:   subscript  ι  normal-⋆    normal-→     subscript  π  1   S      subscript  π  1   M      \iota_{\star}:\pi_{1}(S)\rightarrow\pi_{1}(M)   is injective .  In general, every    π  1     subscript  π  1    \pi_{1}   -injective surface is incompressible, but the reverse implication is not always true. For instance, the Lens space     L   (  4  ,  1  )       L   4  1     L(4,1)   contains an incompressible Klein bottle that is not    π  1     subscript  π  1    \pi_{1}   -injective. However, if   S   S   S   is a two-sided properly embedded, compact surface (not a 2-sphere), the loop theorem implies   S   S   S   is incompressible if and only if it is    π  1     subscript  π  1    \pi_{1}   -injective.
