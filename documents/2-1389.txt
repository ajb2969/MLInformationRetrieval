Sphenic number

In number theory, a sphenic number (from , 'wedge') is a positive integer that is the product of three distinct prime numbers. The smallest sphenic number is 30 = 2 × 3 × 5, the product of the smallest three primes.
Note that this definition is more stringent than simply requiring the integer to have exactly three prime factors; e.g. 60 = 22 × 3 × 5 has exactly 3 prime factors, but is not sphenic.
All sphenic numbers have exactly eight divisors. If we express the sphenic number as 
 
 
 
 , where p, q, and r are distinct primes, then the set of divisors of n will be:



All sphenic numbers are by definition squarefree, because the prime factors must be distinct.
The Möbius function of any sphenic number is −1.
The cyclotomic polynomials

 
 , taken over all sphenic numbers n, may contain arbitrarily large coefficients1 (for n a product of two primes the coefficients are 
 
 
 
 
  or 0).
The first few sphenic numbers are: 30, 42, 66, 70, 78, 102, 105, 110, 114, 130, 138, 154, 165, ...   the largest known sphenic number is (257,885,161 − 1) × (243,112,609 − 1) × (242,643,801 − 1), i.e., the product of the three largest known primes.
Consecutive sphenic numbers
The first case of two consecutive sphenic integers is 230 = 2×5×23 and 231 = 3×7×11. The first case of three is 1309 = 7×11×17, 1310 = 2×5×131, and 1311 = 3×19×23. There is no case of more than three, because every fourth consecutive positive integer is divisible by 4 = 2×2 and therefore not squarefree.
The numbers 2013 (3×11×61), 2014 (2×19×53), and 2015 (5×13×31) are all sphenic. The next three consecutive sphenic years will be 2665 (5×13×41), 2666 (2×31×43) and 2667 (3×7×127) .
