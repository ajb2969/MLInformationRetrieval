   Power function      Power function   In mathematics , a power function is a function of the form    f  :    x  ↦   c    x  r    c    ,   r  ∈  ℝ       normal-:  f   formulae-sequence   maps-to  x    c   superscript  x  r   c      r  ℝ      f\colon x\mapsto cx^{r}\;c,r\in\mathbb{R}   where   c   c   c   and   r   r   r   are constant  real numbers and   x   x   x   is a variable. The domain of a power function can sometimes be all real numbers, but generally a non-negativity    x  ≥  0      x  0    x\geq 0   is used to avoid problems with simplifying. The domain of definition is determined by each individual case.  Power functions are a special case of power law relationships, which appear throughout mathematics and statistics.
