Power function

 In mathematics, a power function is a function of the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are constant real numbers and 
 
 
 
  is a variable. The domain of a power function can sometimes be all real numbers, but generally a non-negativity 
 
 
 
  is used to avoid problems with simplifying. The domain of definition is determined by each individual case.
Power functions are a special case of power law relationships, which appear throughout mathematics and statistics.
