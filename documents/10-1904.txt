Trithionate hydrolase




Trithionate hydrolase

In enzymology, a trithionate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction12

trithionate + H2O 
 
 
 
  thiosulfate + sulfate + 2 H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trithionate and H2O, whereas its 3 products are thiosulfate, sulfate, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on sulfur-sulfur bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trithionate thiosulfohydrolase. This enzyme participates in sulfur metabolism.
