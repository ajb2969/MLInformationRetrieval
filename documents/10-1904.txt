   Trithionate hydrolase      Trithionate hydrolase   In enzymology , a trithionate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction 1 2   trithionate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   thiosulfate + sulfate + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are trithionate and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are thiosulfate , sulfate , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on sulfur-sulfur bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trithionate thiosulfohydrolase . This enzyme participates in sulfur metabolism .  References  "  Category:EC 3.12.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩  ↩
