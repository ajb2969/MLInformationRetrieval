   Chloromuconate cycloisomerase      Chloromuconate cycloisomerase   In enzymology , a chloromuconate cycloisomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-chloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-chloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate , and one product , 3-chloro-cis,cis-muconate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-chloro-2,5-dihydro-5-oxofuran-2-acetate lyase (decyclizing) . This enzyme is also called muconate cycloisomerase II . This enzyme participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation and 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation . It employs one cofactor , manganese .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
