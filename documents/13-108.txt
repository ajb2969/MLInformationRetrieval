Multi-track Turing machine




Multi-track Turing machine

A Multitrack Turing machine is a specific type of Multi-tape Turing machine. In a standard n-tape Turing machine, n heads move independently along n tracks. In a n-track Turing machine, one head reads and writes on all tracks simultaneously. A tape position in a n-track Turing Machine contains n symbols from the tape alphabet. It is equivalent to the standard Turing machine and therefore accepts precisely the recursively enumerable languages.
Formal definition
A multitape Turing machine can be formally defined as a 6-tuple 
 
 
 
 , where



 
  is a finite set of states


 
  is a finite set of symbols called the tape alphabet





 
  is the initial state


 
  is the set of final or accepting states.


 
  is a relation on states and symbols called the transition relation.

Proof of equivalency to standard Turing machine
This will prove that a two-track Turing machine is equivalent to a standard Turing machine. This can be generalized to a n-track Turing machine. Let L be a recursively enumerable language. Let M= 
 
 
 
  be standard Turing machine that accepts L. Let M' is a two-track Turing machine. To prove M=M' it must be shown that M 
 
 
 
  M' and M' 
 
 
 
  M





If all but the first track is ignored then M and M' are clearly equivalent.





The tape alphabet of a one-track Turing machine equivalent to a two-track Turing machine consists of an ordered pair. The input symbol a of a Turing machine M' can be identified as an ordered pair [x,y] of Turing machine M. The one-track Turing machine is:
M= 
 
 
 
  with the transition function 
 
 

This machine also accepts L.
