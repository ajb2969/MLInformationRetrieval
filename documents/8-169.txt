   Diagonally dominant matrix      Diagonally dominant matrix   In mathematics, a matrix is said to be diagonally dominant if for every row of the matrix, the magnitude of the diagonal entry in a row is larger than or equal to the sum of the magnitudes of all the other (non-diagonal) entries in that row. More precisely, the matrix A is diagonally dominant if        |   a   i  i    |   ‚â•     ‚àë   j  ‚â†  i     |   a   i  j    |     for all  i     ,         subscript  a    i  i        subscript     j  i       subscript  a    i  j        for all  i      |a_{ii}|\geq\sum_{j\neq i}|a_{ij}|\quad\text{for all }i,\,   where a ij denotes the entry in the i th row and j th column.  Note that this definition uses a weak inequality, and is therefore sometimes called weak diagonal dominance . If a strict inequality (>) is used, this is called strict diagonal dominance . The unqualified term diagonal dominance can mean both strict and weak diagonal dominance, depending on the context. 1  Variations  The definition in the first paragraph sums entries across rows. It is therefore sometimes called row diagonal dominance . If one changes the definition to sum down columns, this is called column diagonal dominance .  If an irreducible matrix is weakly diagonally dominant, but in at least one row (or column) is strictly diagonally dominant, then the matrix is irreducibly diagonally dominant .  Examples  The matrix      ùêÄ  =   [     3     -  2     1      1     -  3     2       -  1     2    4     ]       ùêÄ    3    2   1    1    3   2      1   2  4      \mathbf{A}=\begin{bmatrix}3&-2&1\\

 -1&2&4\end{bmatrix}     gives       |   a  11   |   ‚â•    |   a  12   |   +   |   a  13   |           subscript  a  11         subscript  a  12       subscript  a  13       |a_{11}|\geq|a_{12}|+|a_{13}|   since     |  3  |   ‚â•    |   -  2   |   +   |  1  |          3         2      1      |3|\geq|-2|+|1|          |   a  22   |   ‚â•    |   a  21   |   +   |   a  23   |           subscript  a  22         subscript  a  21       subscript  a  23       |a_{22}|\geq|a_{21}|+|a_{23}|   since     |   -  3   |   ‚â•    |  1  |   +   |  2  |            3        1     2      |-3|\geq|1|+|2|          |   a  33   |   ‚â•    |   a  31   |   +   |   a  32   |           subscript  a  33         subscript  a  31       subscript  a  32       |a_{33}|\geq|a_{31}|+|a_{32}|   since     |  4  |   ‚â•    |   -  1   |   +   |  2  |          4         1      2      |4|\geq|-1|+|2|   .  Because the magnitude of each diagonal element is greater than or equal to the sum of the magnitude of other elements in the row, A is diagonally dominant.  The matrix      ùêÅ  =   [      -  2     2    1      1    3    2      1     -  2     0     ]       ùêÅ      2   2  1    1  3  2    1    2   0      \mathbf{B}=\begin{bmatrix}-2&2&1\\

Because    |   b  11   |       subscript  b  11     |b_{11}|   and    |   b  33   |       subscript  b  33     |b_{33}|   are less than the sum of the magnitude of other elements in their respective row, B is not diagonally dominant.  The matrix      ùêÇ  =   [      -  4     2    1      1    6    2      1     -  2     5     ]       ùêÇ      4   2  1    1  6  2    1    2   5      \mathbf{C}=\begin{bmatrix}-4&2&1\\

Because the magnitude of each diagonal element is greater than the sum of the magnitude of the other elements in the row, C is strictly diagonally dominant.  Applications and properties  A strictly diagonally dominant matrix (or an irreducibly diagonally dominant matrix 2 ) is non-singular . This result is known as the Levy‚ÄìDesplanques theorem. 3 This can be proved, for strictly diagonal dominant matrices, using the Gershgorin circle theorem .  An Hermitian diagonally dominant matrix   A   A   A   with real non-negative diagonal entries is positive semidefinite . (Proof: Let the diagonal matrix   D   D   D   contain the diagonal entries of   A   A   A   . Connect   A   A   A   and    D  +  I      D  I    D+I   via a segment of matrices     M   (  t  )    =     (   1  -  t   )    (   D  +  I   )    +   t  A          M  t         1  t     D  I      t  A      M(t)=(1-t)(D+I)+tA   . This segment consists of strictly diagonally dominant (thus nonsingular) matrices, except maybe for   A   A   A   . This shows that     det   (  A  )    ‚â•  0        det  A   0    \mathrm{det}(A)\geq 0   . Applying this argument to the principal minors of   A   A   A   , the positive semidefiniteness follows by Sylvester's criterion .)  If the symmetry requirement is eliminated, such a matrix is not necessarily positive semidefinite (for example,      (      -   5      2    1     )    (     1    1    0      1    1    0      1    0    1     )    (      -   5        2      1     )    =   10  -   5   5     <  0                5    2  1      1  1  0    1  1  0    1  0  1          5      2    1       10    5    5          0     \begin{pmatrix}-\sqrt{5}&2&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}1&1&0\\
 1&1&0\\
 1&0&1\end{pmatrix}\begin{pmatrix}-\sqrt{5}\\
 2\\
 1\end{pmatrix}=10-5\sqrt{5}<0   ); however, the real parts of its eigenvalues are non-negative (see Gershgorin's circle theorem ).  Similarly, an Hermitian strictly diagonally dominant matrix with real positive diagonal entries is positive definite , as it equals to the sum of some Hermitian diagonally dominant matrix   A   A   A   with real non-negative diagonal entries (which is positive semidefinite) and    x  I      x  I    xI   for some positive real number   x   x   x   (which is positive definite).  No (partial) pivoting is necessary for a strictly column diagonally dominant matrix when performing Gaussian elimination (LU factorization).  The Jacobi and Gauss‚ÄìSeidel methods for solving a linear system converge if the matrix is strictly (or irreducibly) diagonally dominant.  Many matrices that arise in finite element methods are diagonally dominant.  A slight variation on the idea of diagonal dominance is used to prove that the pairing on diagrams without loops in the Temperley‚ÄìLieb algebra is nondegenerate. 4 For a matrix with polynomial entries, one sensible definition of diagonal dominance is if the highest power of   q   q   q   appearing in each row appears only on the diagonal. (The evaluations of such a matrix at large values of   q   q   q   are diagonally dominant in the above sense.)  Notes    References   Gene H. Golub & Charles F. Van Loan. Matrix Computations , 1996.
