   Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase      Formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   10-formyltetrahydrofolate + NADP + + H 2 O $\rightleftharpoons$ tetrahydrofolate + CO 2 + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 10-formyltetrahydrofolate , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are tetrahydrofolate , CO 2 , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 10-formyltetrahydrofolate:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 10-formyl tetrahydrofolate:NADP oxidoreductase , 10-formyl-H2PtGlu:NADP oxidoreductase , 10-formyl-H4folate dehydrogenase , N10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase , and 10-formyltetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in one carbon pool by folate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
