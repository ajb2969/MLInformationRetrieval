Coding gain

In coding theory and related engineering problems, coding gain is the measure in the difference between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels between the uncoded system and coded system required to reach the same bit error rate (BER) levels when used with the error correcting code (ECC).
Example
If the uncoded BPSK system in AWGN environment has a bit error rate (BER) of 10−2 at the SNR level 4 dB, and the corresponding coded (e.g., BCH) system has the same BER at an SNR of 2.5 dB, then we say the coding gain = , due to the code used (in this case BCH).
Power-limited regime
In the power-limited regime (where the nominal spectral efficiency

 
  [b/2D or b/s/Hz], i.e. the domain of binary signaling), the effective coding gain 
 
 
 
  of a signal set 
 
 
 
  at a given target error probability per bit 
 
 
 
  is defined as the difference in dB between the 
 
 
 
  required to achieve the target 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and the 
 
 
 
  required to achieve the target 
 
 
 
  with 2-PAM or (2×2)-QAM (i.e. no coding). The nominal coding gain 
 
 
 
  is defined as



This definition is normalized so that 
 
 
 
  for 2-PAM or (2×2)-QAM. If the average number of nearest neighbors per transmitted bit 
 
 
 
  is equal to one, the effective coding gain 
 
 
 
  is approximately equal to the nominal coding gain 
 
 
 
 . However, if 
 
 
 
 , the effective coding gain 
 
 
 
  is less than the nominal coding gain 
 
 
 
  by an amount which depends on the steepness of the 
 
 
vs.

 
  curve at the target 
 
 
 
 . This curve can be plotted using the union bound estimate (UBE)



where Q is the Gaussian probability-of-error function.
For the special case of a binary linear block code

 
  with parameters 
 
 
 
 , the nominal spectral efficiency is 
 
 
 
  and the nominal coding gain is kd/n.

Bandwidth-limited regime
In the bandwidth-limited regime (
 
 
 
 , i.e. the domain of non-binary signaling), the effective coding gain 
 
 
 
  of a signal set 
 
 
 
  at a given target error rate 
 
 
 
  is defined as the difference in dB between the 
 
 
 
  required to achieve the target 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and the 
 
 
 
  required to achieve the target 
 
 
 
  with M-PAM or (M×M)-QAM (i.e. no coding). The nominal coding gain 
 
 
 
  is defined as



This definition is normalized so that 
 
 
 
  for M-PAM or (M×M)-QAM. The UBE becomes



where 
 
 
 
  is the average number of nearest neighbors per two dimensions.
