Khabibullin's conjecture on integral inequalities

In mathematics, Khabibullin's conjecture, named after B. N. Khabibullin, is related to Paley's problem1 for plurisubharmonic functions and to various extremal problems in the theory of entire functions of several variables.
The first statement in terms of logarithmically convex functions
Khabibullin's conjecture (version 1, 1992). Let 
 
 
 
  be a non-negative increasing function on the half-line 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Assume that 
 
 
 
  is a convex function of 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . If 
then {(1+t^{2\lambda})^2}\,dt\leq \frac{\pi\,(n-1)}{2\lambda}\prod_{k=1}^{n-1} \Bigl(1+\frac{\lambda}{2k}\Bigr).|2}}
This statement of the Khabibullin's conjecture completes his survey.2
Relation to Euler's Beta function
Note that the product in the right hand side of the inequality () is related to the Euler's Beta function

Discussion
For each fixed 
 
 
 
  the function



turns the inequalities () and () to equalities.
The Khabibullin's conjecture is valid for 
 
 
 
  without the assumption of convexity of 
 
 
 
 . Meanwhile, one can show that this conjecture is not valid without some convexity conditions for 
 
 
 
 . Nowadays it is even unknown if the conjecture is true for 
 
 
 
  and for at least one 
 
 
 
 .
The second statement in terms of increasing functions
Khabibullin's conjecture (version 2). Let 
 
 
 
  be a non-negative increasing function on the half-line 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If



then



The third statement in terms of non-negative functions
Khabibullin's conjecture (version 3). Let 
 
 
 
  be a non-negative continuous function on the half-line 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . If



then
