   Histidinol-phosphatase      Histidinol-phosphatase   In enzymology , a histidinol-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-histidinol phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-histidinol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-histidinol phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-histidinol and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , to be specific, those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-histidinol-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include histidinol phosphate phosphatase , L-histidinol phosphate phosphatase , histidinolphosphate phosphatase , HPpase , and histidinolphosphatase . This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .  E. coli  In E. coli the enzyme encoded by the gene hisB is a fused imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase and histidinol-phosphatase. 1  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩
