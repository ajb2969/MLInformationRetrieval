   Complex modulus      Complex modulus   Complex modulus may refer to:   the norm or absolute value (mathematics) of a complex number      |   x  +   i  y    |   =     x  2   +   y  2      .          x    i  y          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       |x+iy|=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}.     Dynamic modulus (materials engineering), the ratio of stress to strain under vibratory conditions. 1   Notes  "     The use of the term complex modulus as equivalent to dynamic modulus is based on: The Open University (UK), 2000.
