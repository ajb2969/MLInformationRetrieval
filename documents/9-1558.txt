   Probabilistic automaton      Probabilistic automaton   In mathematics and computer science , the probabilistic automaton ( PA ) is a generalization of the non-deterministic finite automaton ; it includes the probability of a given transition into the transition function , turning it into a transition matrix or stochastic matrix . Thus, the probabilistic automaton generalizes the concept of a Markov chain or subshift of finite type . The languages recognized by probabilistic automata are called stochastic languages ; these include the regular languages as a subset. The number of stochastic languages is uncountable .  The concept was introduced by Michael O. Rabin in 1963; 1 a certain special case is sometimes known as the Rabin automaton . In recent years, a variant has been formulated in terms of quantum probabilities, the quantum finite automaton .  Definition  The probabilistic automaton may be defined as an extension of a non-deterministic finite automaton     (  Q  ,  Σ  ,  δ  ,   q  0   ,  F  )     Q  normal-Σ  δ   subscript  q  0   F    (Q,\Sigma,\delta,q_{0},F)   , together with two probabilities: the probability   P   P   P   of a particular state transition taking place, and with the initial state    q  0     subscript  q  0    q_{0}   replaced by a stochastic vector giving the probability of the automaton being in a given initial state.  For the ordinary non-deterministic finite automaton, one has   a finite set of states   Q   Q   Q     a finite set of input symbols    Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma     a transition function    δ  :    Q  ×  Σ   →   P   (  Q  )        normal-:  δ   normal-→    Q  normal-Σ     P  Q      \delta:Q\times\Sigma\to P(Q)     a set of states   F   F   F   distinguished as accepting (or final ) states     F  ⊂  Q      F  Q    F\subset Q   .   Here,    P   (  Q  )       P  Q    P(Q)   denotes the power set of   Q   Q   Q   .  By use of currying , the transition function    δ  :    Q  ×  Σ   →   P   (  Q  )        normal-:  δ   normal-→    Q  normal-Σ     P  Q      \delta:Q\times\Sigma\to P(Q)   of a non-deterministic finite automaton can be written as a membership function      δ  :    Q  ×  Σ  ×  Q   →   {  0  ,  1  }       normal-:  δ   normal-→    Q  normal-Σ  Q    0  1      \delta:Q\times\Sigma\times Q\to\{0,1\}     so that     δ   (  q  ,  a  ,   q  ′   )    =  1        δ   q  a   superscript  q  normal-′     1    \delta(q,a,q^{\prime})=1   if     q  ′   ∈   δ   (  q  ,  a  )         superscript  q  normal-′     δ   q  a      q^{\prime}\in\delta(q,a)   and     δ   (  q  ,  a  ,   q  ′   )    =  0        δ   q  a   superscript  q  normal-′     0    \delta(q,a,q^{\prime})=0   if     q  ′   ∉   δ   (  q  ,  a  )         superscript  q  normal-′     δ   q  a      q^{\prime}\notin\delta(q,a)   . The curried transition function can be understood to be a matrix with matrix entries        [   θ  a   ]    q   q  ′     =   δ   (  q  ,  a  ,   q  ′   )         subscript   delimited-[]   subscript  θ  a      q   superscript  q  normal-′       δ   q  a   superscript  q  normal-′       \left[\theta_{a}\right]_{qq^{\prime}}=\delta(q,a,q^{\prime})     The matrix    θ  a     subscript  θ  a    \theta_{a}   is then a square matrix, whose entries are zero or one, indicating whether a transition    q   →  a    q  ′       superscript  normal-→  a   q   superscript  q  normal-′     q\stackrel{a}{\rightarrow}q^{\prime}   is allowed by the NFA. Such a transition matrix is always defined for a non-deterministic finite automaton.  The probabilistic automaton replaces this matrix by a stochastic matrix    P   P   P   , so that the probability of a transition is given by       [   P  a   ]    q   q  ′       subscript   delimited-[]   subscript  P  a      q   superscript  q  normal-′      \left[P_{a}\right]_{qq^{\prime}}     A state change from some state to any state must occur with probability one, of course, and so one must have        ∑   q  ′      [   P  a   ]    q   q  ′      =  1        subscript    superscript  q  normal-′     subscript   delimited-[]   subscript  P  a      q   superscript  q  normal-′      1    \sum_{q^{\prime}}\left[P_{a}\right]_{qq^{\prime}}=1     for all input letters   a   a   a   and internal states   q   q   q   . The initial state of a probabilistic automaton is given by a row vector    v   v   v   , whose components add to unity:        ∑  q     [  v  ]   q    =  1        subscript   q    subscript   delimited-[]  v   q    1    \sum_{q}\left[v\right]_{q}=1     The transition matrix acts on the right, so that the state of the probabilistic automaton, after consuming the input string    a  b  c      a  b  c    abc   , would be      v   P  a    P  b    P  c       v   subscript  P  a    subscript  P  b    subscript  P  c     vP_{a}P_{b}P_{c}     In particular, the state of a probabilistic automaton is always a stochastic vector, since the product of any two stochastic matrices is a stochastic matrix, and the product of a stochastic vector and a stochastic matrix is again a stochastic vector. This vector is sometimes called the distribution of states , emphasizing that it is a discrete probability distribution .  Formally, the definition of a probabilistic automaton does not require the mechanics of the non-deterministic automaton, which may be dispensed with. Formally, a probabilistic automaton PA is defined as the tuple    (  Q  ,  Σ  ,  P  ,  v  ,  F  )     Q  normal-Σ  P  v  F    (Q,\Sigma,P,v,F)   . A Rabin automaton is one for which the initial distribution   v   v   v   is a coordinate vector ; that is, has zero for all but one entries, and the remaining entry being one.  Stochastic languages  The set of languages recognized by probabilistic automata are called stochastic languages . They include the regular languages as a subset.  Let    F  =   Q  accept   ⊂  Q        F   subscript  Q  accept        Q     F=Q_{\text{accept}}\subset Q   be the set of "accepting" or "final" states of the automaton. By abuse of notation,    Q  accept     subscript  Q  accept    Q_{\text{accept}}   can also be understood to be the column vector that is the membership function for    Q  accept     subscript  Q  accept    Q_{\text{accept}}   ; that is, it has a 1 at the places corresponding to elements in    Q  accept     subscript  Q  accept    Q_{\text{accept}}   , and a zero otherwise. This vector may be contracted with the internal state probability, to form a scalar . The language recognized by a specific automaton is then defined as       L  η   =   {   s  ∈   Σ  *    |    v   P  s    Q  accept    >  η   }        subscript  L  η    conditional-set    s   superscript  normal-Σ         v   subscript  P  s    subscript  Q  accept    η      L_{\eta}=\{s\in\Sigma^{*}|vP_{s}Q_{\text{accept}}>\eta\}     where    Σ  *     superscript  normal-Σ     \Sigma^{*}   is the set of all strings in the alphabet    Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   (so that * is the Kleene star ). The language depends on the value of the cut-point    η   η   \eta   , normally taken to be in the range    0  ≤  η  <  1        0  η       1     0\leq\eta<1   .  A language is called η-stochastic if and only if there exists some PA that recognizes the language, for fixed   η   η   \eta   . A language is called stochastic if and only if there is some    0  ≤  η  <  1        0  η       1     0\leq\eta<1   for which    L  η     subscript  L  η    L_{\eta}   is η-stochastic.  A cut-point is said to be an isolated cut-point if and only if there exists a    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   such that       |    v  P   (  s  )    Q  accept    -  η   |   ≥  δ            v  P  s   subscript  Q  accept    η    δ    |vP(s)Q_{\text{accept}}-\eta|\geq\delta     for all    s  ∈   Σ  *       s   superscript  normal-Σ      s\in\Sigma^{*}     Properties  Every regular language is stochastic, and more strongly, every regular language is η-stochastic. A weak converse is that every 0-stochastic language is regular; however, the general converse does not hold: there are stochastic languages that are not regular.  Every η-stochastic language is stochastic, for some    0  <  η  <  1        0  η       1     0<\eta<1   .  Every stochastic language is representable by a Rabin automaton.  If   η   η   \eta   is an isolated cut-point, then    L  η     subscript  L  η    L_{\eta}   is a regular language.  p -adic languages  The p -adic languages provide an example of a stochastic language that is not regular, and also show that the number of stochastic languages is uncountable. A p -adic language is defined as the set of strings in the letters    0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,   (   p  -  1   )      0  1  2  normal-…    p  1     0,1,2,\ldots,(p-1)   such that     η   η   \eta     That is, a p -adic language is merely the set of real numbers, written in base- p , such that they are greater than   η   η   \eta   . It is straightforward to show that all p -adic languages are stochastic. However, a p -adic language is regular if and only if $\eta$ is rational. In particular, this implies that the number of stochastic languages is uncountable.  Generalizations  The probabilistic automaton has a geometric interpretation: the state vector can be understood to be a point that lives on the face of the standard simplex , opposite to the orthogonal corner. The transition matrices form a monoid , acting on the point. This may be generalized by having the point be from some general topological space , while the transition matrices are chosen from a collection of operators acting on the topological space, thus forming a semiautomaton . When the cut-point is suitably generalized, one has a topological automaton .  An example of such a generalization is the quantum finite automaton ; here, the automaton state is represented by a point in complex projective space , while the transition matrices are a fixed set chosen from the unitary group . The cut-point is understood as a limit on the maximum value of the quantum angle .  References     Arto Salomaa, Theory of Automata (1969) Pergamon Press, Oxford (See chapter 2) .
