   Scott continuity      Scott continuity   In mathematics , given two partially ordered sets  P and Q , a function     f  :   P  →  Q      normal-:  f   normal-→  P  Q     f:P\rightarrow Q   between them is Scott-continuous (named after the mathematician Dana Scott ) if it preserves all directed suprema, i.e. if for every directed subset  D of P with supremum in P its image has a supremum in Q , and that supremum is the image of the supremum of D      ⊔   f   [  D  ]     =   f   (   ⊔  D   )         square-union    f   delimited-[]  D       f   square-union  D      \sqcup f[D]=f(\sqcup D)   . 1  A subset O of a partially ordered set P is called Scott-open if it is an upper set and if it is inaccessible by directed joins , i.e. if all directed sets D with supremum in O have non-empty intersection with O . The Scott-open subsets of a partially ordered set P form a topology on P , the Scott topology . A function between partially ordered sets is Scott-continuous if and only if it is continuous with respect to the Scott topology. 2  The Scott topology was first defined by Dana Scott for complete lattices and later defined for arbitrary partially ordered sets. 3  Scott-continuous functions show up in the study of models for lambda calculi 4 and the denotational semantics of computer programs.  Properties  A Scott-continuous function is always monotonic .  A subset of a partially ordered set is closed with respect to the Scott topology induced by the partial order if and only if it is a lower set and closed under suprema of directed subsets. 5  A directed complete partial order (dcpo) with the Scott topology is always a Kolmogorov space (i.e., it satisfies the T 0 separation axiom ). 6 However, a dcpo with the Scott topology is a Hausdorff space if and only if the order is trivial. 7 The Scott-open sets form a complete lattice when ordered by inclusion . 8  For any topological space satisfying the T 0 separation axiom, the topology induces an order relation on that space, the specialization order :  if and only if every open neighbourhood of x is also an open neighbourhood of y . The order relation of a dcpo D can be reconstructed from the Scott-open sets as the specialization order induced by the Scott topology. However, a dcpo equipped with the Scott topology need not be sober : The specialization order induced by the topology of a sober space makes that space into a dcpo, but the Scott topology derived from this order is finer than the original topology. 9  Examples  The open sets in a given topological space when ordered by inclusion form a lattice on which the Scott topology can be defined. A subset X of a topological space T is compact with respect to the topology on T (in the sense that every open cover of X contains a finite subcover of X ) if and only if the set of open neighbourhoods of X is open with respect to the Scott topology. 10  For CPO , the cartesian closed category of complete partial orders , two particularly notable examples of Scott-continuous functions are curry and apply . 11  See also   Alexandrov topology  Upper topology   Footnotes    References     "  Category:Order theory  Category:General topology  Category:Domain theory     ↩   ↩       ↩  ↩   (See theorems 1.2.13, 1.2.14) ↩
