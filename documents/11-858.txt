   Arginine N-succinyltransferase      Arginine N-succinyltransferase   In enzymology , an arginine N-succinyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinyl-CoA + L-arginine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N 2 -succinyl-L-arginine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and L-arginine , whereas its two products are CoA and N2-succinyl-L-arginine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:L-arginine N2-succinyltransferase . Other names in common use include arginine succinyltransferase , AstA , arginine and ornithine N2-succinyltransferase , AOST , AST , and succinyl-CoA:L-arginine 2-N-succinyltransferase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
