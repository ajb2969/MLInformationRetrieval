   4-Hydroxybenzoate geranyltransferase      4-Hydroxybenzoate geranyltransferase   4-hydroxybenzoate geranyltransferase (, PGT1 , PGT2 , 4HB geranyltransferase , 4HB:geranyltransferase , p-hydroxybenzoate geranyltransferase , PHB geranyltransferase , geranyl diphosphate:4-hydroxybenzoate geranyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate:4-hydroxybenzoate 3-geranyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate + 4-hydroxybenzoate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-geranyl-4-hydroxybenzoate + diphosphate    The enzyme is involved in shikonin biosynthesis. It has a strict substrate specificity for geranyl diphosphate and an absolute requirement for Mg 2+ .  References  External links     "  Category:EC 2.5.1     ↩  ↩  ↩
