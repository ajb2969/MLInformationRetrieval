   Tetration      Tetration   In mathematics , tetration (or hyper-4 ) is the next hyperoperator after exponentiation , and is defined as iterated exponentiation. The word was coined by Reuben Louis Goodstein , from tetra- (four) and iteration . Tetration is used for the notation of very large numbers . Shown here are examples of the first four hyperoperators , with tetration as the fourth (and succession , the unary operation denoted     a  ′   =   a  +  1        superscript  a  normal-′     a  1     a^{\prime}=a+1   taking   a   a   a   and yielding the number after   a   a   a   , as the 0th):   Addition       a  +  n   =   a  +     1  +  1  +  ⋯  +  1   ⏟   n          a  n     a   subscript   normal-⏟    1  1  normal-⋯  1    n      a+n=a+\underbrace{1+1+\cdots+1}_{n}       n copies of 1 added to a .     Multiplication       a  ×  n   =     a  +  a  +  ⋯  +  a   ⏟   n         a  n    subscript   normal-⏟    a  a  normal-⋯  a    n     a\times n=\underbrace{a+a+\cdots+a}_{n}       n copies of a combined by addition.     Exponentiation       a  n   =     a  ×  a  ×  ⋯  ×  a   ⏟   n        superscript  a  n    subscript   normal-⏟    a  a  normal-⋯  a    n     a^{n}=\underbrace{a\times a\times\cdots\times a}_{n}       n copies of a combined by multiplication.     Tetration      a    n   =     a   a   ⋅   ⋅  a      ⏟   n        superscript  a  n    subscript   normal-⏟   superscript  a   superscript  a   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  a       n     {{}^{n}a}=\underbrace{a^{a^{\cdot^{\cdot^{a}}}}}_{n}       n copies of a combined by exponentiation, right-to-left.      where each operation is defined by iterating the previous one (the next operation in the sequence is pentation ). Tetration is not an elementary function or an elementary recursive function . 1  Here, succession (     a  ′   =   a  +  1        superscript  a  normal-′     a  1     a^{\prime}=a+1   ) is the most basic operation; addition (    a  +  n      a  n    a+n   ) is a primary operation, though for natural numbers it can be thought of as a chained succession of n successors of a ; multiplication (    a  n      a  n    an   ) is also a primary operation, though for natural numbers it can be thought of as a chained addition involving n numbers a ; and exponentiation (    a  n     superscript  a  n    a^{n}   ) can be thought of as a chained multiplication involving n numbers a . Analogously, tetration (    a    n     superscript  a  n    {}^{n}a   ) can be thought of as a chained power involving n numbers a . The parameter a may be called the base-parameter in the following, while the parameter n in the following may be called the height -parameter (which is integral in the first approach but may be generalized to fractional, real and complex heights , see below).  Definition  For any positive real     a  >  0      a  0    a>0   and non-negative integer     n  ≥  0      n  0    n\geq 0   , we define    a    n     superscript  a  n    \,\!{{}^{n}a}   by:       a    n   :=   {     1      if  n   =  0        a   [   a     (   n  -  1   )    ]        if  n   >  0          assign   superscript  a  n    cases  1      if  n   0    superscript  a   delimited-[]   superscript  a    n  1          if  n   0      {{}^{n}a}:=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }n=0\\
 a^{\left[{}^{(n-1)}a\right]}&\text{if }n>0\end{cases}     Iterated powers vs. iterated bases/exponentiation  As we can see from the definition, when evaluating tetration expressed as an "exponentiation tower", the exponentiation is done at the deepest level first (in the notation, at the highest level). In other words:        2    4    =   2   2   2  2     =   2   [   2   (   2  2   )    ]    =   2   (   2  4   )    =   2  16   =  65  ,  536     fragments   superscript  2  4     superscript  2   superscript  2   superscript  2  2       superscript  2   delimited-[]   superscript  2   superscript  2  2        superscript  2   superscript  2  4      superscript  2  16    65  normal-,  536    \,\!\ {}^{4}2=2^{2^{2^{2}}}=2^{\left[2^{\left(2^{2}\right)}\right]}=2^{\left(2%
 ^{4}\right)}=2^{16}=65,\!536     Note that exponentiation is not associative , so evaluating the expression in the other order will lead to a different answer:       2   2   2  2     ≠    [    (   2  2   )   2   ]   2   =   2   2  ⋅  2  ⋅  2    =  256         superscript  2   superscript  2   superscript  2  2      superscript   delimited-[]   superscript   superscript  2  2   2    2         superscript  2   normal-⋅  2  2  2         256     \,\!2^{2^{2^{2}}}\neq\left[{\left(2^{2}\right)}^{2}\right]^{2}=2^{2\cdot 2%
 \cdot 2}=256     Thus, the exponential towers must be evaluated from top to bottom (or right to left). Computer programmers refer to this choice as right-associative .  When a and 10 are coprime , we can compute the last m decimal digits of     a    n      superscript  a  n    \,\!\ {}^{n}a   using Euler's theorem .  Terminology  There are many terms for tetration, each of which has some logic behind it, but some have not become commonly used for one reason or another. Here is a comparison of each term with its rationale and counter-rationale.   The term tetration , introduced by Goodstein in his 1947 paper Transfinite Ordinals in Recursive Number Theory 2 (generalizing the recursive base-representation used in Goodstein's theorem to use higher operations), has gained dominance. It was also popularized in Rudy Rucker's Infinity and the Mind .  The term superexponentiation was published by Bromer in his paper Superexponentiation in 1987. 3 It was used earlier by Ed Nelson in his book Predicative Arithmetic, Princeton University Press, 1986.  The term hyperpower 4 is a natural combination of hyper and power , which aptly describes tetration. The problem lies in the meaning of hyper with respect to the hyperoperator hierarchy. When considering hyperoperators, the term hyper refers to all ranks, and the term super refers to rank 4, or tetration. So under these considerations hyperpower is misleading, since it is only referring to tetration.  The term power tower 5 is occasionally used, in the form "the power tower of order n " for                        a   a   ⋅   ⋅  a      ⏟       n           STACKED  absent  absent    STACKED   normal-⏟   superscript  a   superscript  a   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  a       n     {\ \atop{\ }}{{\underbrace{a^{a^{\cdot^{\cdot^{a}}}}}}\atop n}      Owing in part to some shared terminology and similar notational symbolism , tetration is often confused with closely related functions and expressions. Here are a few related terms:        Form   Terminology           a   a   ⋅   ⋅   a  a         superscript  a   superscript  a   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  a  a        a^{a^{\cdot^{\cdot^{a^{a}}}}}      Tetration         a   a   ⋅   ⋅   a  x         superscript  a   superscript  a   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  a  x        a^{a^{\cdot^{\cdot^{a^{x}}}}}      Iterated exponentials         a  1   a  2   ⋅   ⋅   a  n         superscript   subscript  a  1    superscript   subscript  a  2    superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅   subscript  a  n        a_{1}^{a_{2}^{\cdot^{\cdot^{a_{n}}}}}      Nested exponentials (also towers)         a  1   a  2   a  3   ⋅   ⋅  ⋅         superscript   subscript  a  1    superscript   subscript  a  2    superscript   subscript  a  3    superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  normal-⋅        a_{1}^{a_{2}^{a_{3}^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}}      Infinite exponentials (also towers)       In the first two expressions a is the base , and the number of times a appears is the height (add one for x ). In the third expression, n is the height , but each of the bases is different.  Care must be taken when referring to iterated exponentials, as it is common to call expressions of this form iterated exponentiation, which is ambiguous, as this can either mean iterated  powers or iterated exponentials .  Notation  There are many different notation styles that can be used to express tetration (also known as hyper-4; some of them can be used as well for hyper-5, hyper-6, and higher hyperoperations ).

Extension of domain for bases  Extension to base zero  The exponential    0  0     superscript  0  0    0^{0}   is not consistently defined. Thus, the tetrations     0    n      superscript  0  n    \,{{}^{n}0}   are not clearly defined by the formula given earlier. However,     lim   x  →  0     x    n       subscript    normal-→  x  0     superscript  x  n     \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}{}^{n}x   is well defined, and exists:        lim   x  →  0     x    n    =   {      1  ,      n  even        0  ,      n  odd             subscript    normal-→  x  0     superscript  x  n     cases  1    n  even   0    n  odd      \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}{}^{n}x=\begin{cases}1,&n\text{ even}\\
 0,&n\text{ odd}\end{cases}   Thus we could consistently define     0    n   =   lim   x  →  0     x    n      fragments   superscript  0  n     subscript    normal-→  x  0     superscript  x  n     {}^{n}0=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0}{}^{n}x   . This is equivalent to defining     0  0   =  1       superscript  0  0   1    0^{0}=1   .  Under this extension,     0    0   =  1     fragments   superscript  0  0    1    {}^{0}0=1   , so the rule     a    0   =  1       superscript  a  0   1    {{}^{0}a}=1   from the original definition still holds.  Extension to complex bases    Since complex numbers can be raised to powers, tetration can be applied to bases of the form     z   =   a  +   b  i        z    a    b  i      \scriptstyle z\;=\;a+bi   , where      i  2    =   -  1        superscript  i  2     1     \scriptstyle i^{2}\;=\;-1   . For example,    z    n     superscript  z  n    \scriptstyle{}^{n}z   where     z   =  i      z  i    \scriptstyle z\;=\;i   , tetration is achieved by using the principal branch of the natural logarithm, and using Euler's formula we get the relation:       i   a  +   b  i     =   e    1  2   π  i   (   a  +   b  i    )     =    e   -    1  2   π  b      (    cos    π  a   2    +   i   sin    π  a   2      )           superscript  i    a    b  i      superscript  e      1  2   π  i    a    b  i              superscript  e        1  2   π  b             π  a   2      i        π  a   2          i^{a+bi}=e^{\frac{1}{2}{\pi i}(a+bi)}=e^{-\frac{1}{2}{\pi b}}\left(\cos{\frac{%
 \pi a}{2}}+i\sin{\frac{\pi a}{2}}\right)     This suggests a recursive definition for      i      (   n  +  1   )    =    a  ′   +    b  ′   i         superscript  i    n  1       superscript  a  normal-′      superscript  b  normal-′   i      \scriptstyle{}^{(n+1)}i\;=\;a^{\prime}+b^{\prime}i   given any      i     n   =   a  +   b  i         superscript  i  n     a    b  i      \scriptstyle{}^{n}i\;=\;a+bi   :      a  ′     superscript  a  normal-′    \displaystyle a^{\prime}     The following approximate values can be derived:            i    n     superscript  i  n    {}^{n}i      Approximate Value            i    1   =  i       superscript  i  1   i    {}^{1}i=i         i   i   i             i    2   =   i   (   i    1   )         superscript  i  2    superscript  i   superscript  i  1      {}^{2}i=i^{\left({}^{1}i\right)}         0.2079   0.2079   0.2079             i    3   =   i   (   i    2   )         superscript  i  3    superscript  i   superscript  i  2      {}^{3}i=i^{\left({}^{2}i\right)}          0.9472  +   0.3208  i       0.9472    0.3208  i     0.9472+0.3208i             i    4   =   i   (   i    3   )         superscript  i  4    superscript  i   superscript  i  3      {}^{4}i=i^{\left({}^{3}i\right)}          0.0501  +   0.6021  i       0.0501    0.6021  i     0.0501+0.6021i             i    5   =   i   (   i    4   )         superscript  i  5    superscript  i   superscript  i  4      {}^{5}i=i^{\left({}^{4}i\right)}          0.3872  +   0.0305  i       0.3872    0.0305  i     0.3872+0.0305i             i    6   =   i   (   i    5   )         superscript  i  6    superscript  i   superscript  i  5      {}^{6}i=i^{\left({}^{5}i\right)}          0.7823  +   0.5446  i       0.7823    0.5446  i     0.7823+0.5446i             i    7   =   i   (   i    6   )         superscript  i  7    superscript  i   superscript  i  6      {}^{7}i=i^{\left({}^{6}i\right)}          0.1426  +   0.4005  i       0.1426    0.4005  i     0.1426+0.4005i             i    8   =   i   (   i    7   )         superscript  i  8    superscript  i   superscript  i  7      {}^{8}i=i^{\left({}^{7}i\right)}          0.5198  +   0.1184  i       0.5198    0.1184  i     0.5198+0.1184i             i    9   =   i   (   i    8   )         superscript  i  9    superscript  i   superscript  i  8      {}^{9}i=i^{\left({}^{8}i\right)}          0.5686  +   0.6051  i       0.5686    0.6051  i     0.5686+0.6051i          Solving the inverse relation as in the previous section, yields the expected       i     0    =  1       superscript  i  0   1    \scriptstyle\,{}^{0}i\;=\;1   and       i      (   -  1   )     =  0       superscript  i    1    0    \scriptstyle\,{}^{(-1)}i\;=\;0   , with negative values of n giving infinite results on the imaginary axis. Plotted in the complex plane , the entire sequence spirals to the limit    0.4383  +   0.3606  i       0.4383    0.3606  i     0.4383+0.3606i   , which could be interpreted as the value where n is infinite.  Such tetration sequences have been studied since the time of Euler but are poorly understood due to their chaotic behavior. Most published research historically has focused on the convergence of the power tower function. Current research has greatly benefited by the advent of powerful computers with fractal and symbolic mathematics software. Much of what is known about tetration comes from general knowledge of complex dynamics and specific research of the exponential map.  Extensions of the domain for (iteration) "heights"  Extension to infinite heights  (Figure)  The function    |    W   (   -   ln  z    )     -   ln  z     |          normal-W      z         z       \left|\frac{\mathrm{W}(-\ln{z})}{-\ln{z}}\right|   on the complex plane, showing infinite real power towers (black curve)   Tetration can be extended to infinite heights ( n in    a    n     superscript  a  n    {}^{n}a   ). This is because for bases within a certain interval, tetration converges to a finite value as the height tends to infinity . For example,     2     2     2    ⋅   ⋅  ⋅         superscript    2    superscript    2    superscript    2    superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  normal-⋅        \sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}}   converges to 2, and can therefore be said to be equal to 2. The trend towards 2 can be seen by evaluating a small finite tower:       2     2     2     2     2   1.414         superscript    2    superscript    2    superscript    2    superscript    2    superscript    2   1.414        \displaystyle\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{\sqrt{2}^{1.414}}}}}     In general, the infinite power tower    x   x   ⋅   ⋅  ⋅        superscript  x   superscript  x   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  normal-⋅       x^{x^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}   , defined as the limit of    x    n     superscript  x  n    {}^{n}x   as n goes to infinity, converges for e − e ≤ x ≤ e 1/ e , roughly the interval from 0.066 to 1.44, a result shown by Leonhard Euler . 8 The limit, should it exist, is a positive real solution of the equation y = x y . Thus, x = y 1/ y . The limit defining the infinite tetration of x fails to converge for x > e 1/ e because the maximum of y 1/ y is e 1/ e .  This may be extended to complex numbers z with the definition:        z    ∞   =   z   z   ⋅   ⋅  ⋅      =     W   (   -   ln  z    )     -   ln  z       ,         superscript  z     superscript  z   superscript  z   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  normal-⋅               normal-W      z         z        {}^{\infty}z=z^{z^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}=\frac{\mathrm{W}(-\ln{z})}{-\ln{z}}%
 ~{},   where W ( z ) represents Lambert's W function .  As the limit y = ∞ x (if existent, i.e. for e − e 1/ e ) must satisfy x y = y we see that x ↦ y = ∞ x is (the lower branch of) the inverse function of y ↦ x = y 1/ y .  (Limited) extension to negative heights  In order to preserve the original rule:       a     (   k  +  1   )    =   a   (   a    k   )         superscript  a    k  1     superscript  a   superscript  a  k      {{}^{(k+1)}a}=a^{({{}^{k}a})}   for negative values of   k   k   k   we must use the recursive relation:       a    k   =    log  a    (   a     (   k  +  1   )    )         superscript  a  k     subscript   a    superscript  a    k  1       {{}^{k}a}=\log_{a}\left({{}^{(k+1)}a}\right)     Thus:       a     (   -  1   )    =    log  a    (   a    0   )    =    log  a   1   =  0         superscript  a    1      subscript   a    superscript  a  0           subscript   a   1        0     {}^{(-1)}a=\log_{a}\left({}^{0}a\right)=\log_{a}1=0     However smaller negative values cannot be well defined in this way because       a     (   -  2   )    =    log  a    (   a     -  1    )    =    log  a   0          superscript  a    2      subscript   a    superscript  a    1            subscript   a   0      {}^{(-2)}a=\log_{a}\left({}^{-1}a\right)=\log_{a}0   which is not well defined.  Note further that for    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   any definition of    1     (   -  1   )      superscript  1    1     \,\!{{}^{(-1)}1}   is consistent with the rule because       1    0   =  1  =   1  n      fragments   superscript  1  0    1    superscript  1  n     {{}^{0}1}=1=1^{n}   for any    n  =   1     (   -  1   )       fragments  n    superscript  1    1      \,\!n={{}^{(-1)}1}   .  Extension to real heights  At this time there is no commonly accepted solution to the general problem of extending tetration to the real or complex values of   n   n   n   . Various approaches are mentioned below.  In general the problem is finding, for any real a > 0, a super-exponential function       f    (  x  )    =   a    x         f  x    superscript  a  x     \,f(x)={}^{x}a   over real x > −2 that satisfies         a     (   -  1   )     =  0       superscript  a    1    0    \,{}^{(-1)}a=0           a    0    =  1       superscript  a  0   1    \,{}^{0}a=1           a    x    =    a   (   a     (   x  -  1   )    )    for all real  x   >   -  1.          superscript  a  x      superscript  a   superscript  a    x  1     for all real  x          1.      \,{}^{x}a=a^{\left({}^{(x-1)}a\right)}\text{ for all real }x>-1.     A fourth requirement that is usually one of:   :*A continuity requirement (usually just that    a    x     superscript  a  x    {}^{x}a   is continuous in both variables for    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   ).  :*A differentiability requirement (can be once, twice, k times, or infinitely differentiable in x ).  :*A regularity requirement (implying twice differentiable in x ) that:        (      d  2    d   x  2     f   (  x  )    >  0   )           superscript  d  2     d   superscript  x  2     f  x   0    \left(\frac{d^{2}}{dx^{2}}f(x)>0\right)   for all    x  >  0      x  0    x>0        The fourth requirement differs from author to author, and between approaches. There are two main approaches to extending tetration to real heights, one is based on the regularity requirement, and one is based on the differentiability requirement. These two approaches seem to be so different that they may not be reconciled, as they produce results inconsistent with each other.  When     a    x      superscript  a  x    \,{}^{x}a   is defined for an interval of length one, the whole function easily follows for all x > −2.  Linear approximation for the extension to real heights  A linear approximation (solution to the continuity requirement, approximation to the differentiability requirement) is given by:       a    x   ≈   {       log  a     (   x  +  1    a  )       x  ≤   -  1         1  +  x       -  1   <  x  ≤  0        a   (   a     x  -  1    )       0  <  x            superscript  a  x    cases   fragments   subscript   a    fragments   superscript  normal-(    x  1    a  normal-)      x    1      1  x         1   x       0     superscript  a   superscript  a    x  1       0  x      {}^{x}a\approx\begin{cases}\log_{a}(^{x+1}a)&x\leq-1\\
 1+x&-1   hence:        Approximation   Domain             a    x    ≈   x  +  1        superscript  a  x     x  1     \,{}^{x}a\approx x+1      for -1           a    x    ≈   a  x        superscript  a  x    superscript  a  x     \,{}^{x}a\approx a^{x}      for 0           a    x    ≈   a   a   (   x  -  1   )          superscript  a  x    superscript  a   superscript  a    x  1       \,{}^{x}a\approx a^{a^{(x-1)}}      for 1        and so on. However, it is only piecewise differentiable; at integer values of x the derivative is multiplied by    ln  a      a    \ln{a}   .

The proof is that the second through fourth conditions trivially imply that f is a linear function on [−1, 0].

Therefore the linear approximation to natural tetration is the only solution of the equation     f   (  0  )    =  1        f  0   1    f(0)=1   and    (   -  1   ,   +  ∞   )       1         (-1,+\infty)   which is convex on     a    x   ≈   {       log  a    (   a     x  +  1    )       x  ≤   -  1          1  +      2   ln   (  a  )       1   +   ln   (  a  )       x    -       1   -   ln   (  a  )       1   +   ln   (  a  )        x  2         -  1   <  x  ≤  0        a   (   a     x  -  1    )       0  <  x            superscript  a  x    cases    subscript   a    superscript  a    x  1       x    1        1        2    a      1    a     x          1    a      1    a      superscript  x  2           1   x       0     superscript  a   superscript  a    x  1       0  x      {}^{x}a\approx\begin{cases}\log_{a}({}^{x+1}a)&x\leq-1\\

Higher order approximations for the extension to real heights  A quadratic approximation (to the differentiability requirement) is given by:      x  >  0      x  0    x>0   which is differentiable for all    a  =  e      a  e    a=e   , but not twice differentiable. If      (   a   1  /  n    )   n   =  a       superscript   superscript  a    1  n    n   a    (a^{1/n})^{n}=a   this is the same as the linear approximation.  Note that this function does not satisfy condition that tetration "cancels out" (for example as in raising to power      (   a     1  /  n    )     n   =      (   a     1  /  n    )     (   a     1  /  n    )    ⋅   ⋅   ⋅   ⋅   (   a     1  /  n    )         ⏟   n   ≠  a     fragments   superscript   fragments  normal-(   superscript  a    1  n    normal-)   n     subscript   normal-⏟   superscript   superscript  a    1  n     superscript   superscript  a    1  n     superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  a    1  n           n    a    {}^{n}({}^{1/n}a)=\underbrace{({}^{1/n}a)^{({}^{1/n}a)^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot^{%
 \cdot^{({}^{1/n}a)}}}}}}}_{n}\neq a   ), because it is calculated top-down (as explained in section Iterated powers above) namely:      f  =   F   (   x  +   i  y    )        f    F    x    normal-i  y       f=F(x+{\rm i}y)   .  A cubic approximation and a method for generalizing to approximations of degree n are given at. 10  Extension to complex heights  (Figure)  Drawing of the analytic extension     |  f  |   =   1  ,   e   ±  1    ,   e   ±  2    ,  …         f    1   superscript  e   plus-or-minus  1     superscript  e   plus-or-minus  2    normal-…     |f|=1,e^{\pm 1},e^{\pm 2},\ldots   of tetration to the complex plane.

There is a conjecture 11 that there exists a unique function F which is a solution of the equation  and satisfies the additional conditions that F (0)=1 and F ( z ) approaches the fixed points of the logarithm (roughly 0.318 ± 1.337 i ) as z approaches ± i ∞ and that F is holomorphic in the whole complex z -plane, except the part of the real axis at z ≤−2. This function is shown in the figure at right. The complex double precision approximation of this function is available online. 12  The requirement of holomorphism of tetration is important for the uniqueness. Many functions     S   (  z  )    =    F    (    z   +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     sin   (   2  π  n  z   )     α  n     +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     (   1  -   cos   (   2  π  n  z   )     )    β  n      )          S  z     F    z    superscript   subscript     n  1            2  π  n  z     subscript  α  n       superscript   subscript     n  1          1      2  π  n  z      subscript  β  n         S(z)=F\!\left(~{}z~{}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\sin(2\pi nz)~{}\alpha_{n}+\sum_{n=1}%
 ^{\infty}\Big(1-\cos(2\pi nz)\Big)~{}\beta_{n}\right)   can be constructed as     α   α   \alpha   where   β   β   \beta   and    ℑ   (  z  )       z    \Im(z)   are real sequences which decay fast enough to provide the convergence of the series, at least at moderate values of   π   π   \pi   .  The function S satisfies the tetration equations , S (0)=1, and if α n and β n approach 0 fast enough it will be analytic on a neighborhood of the positive real axis. However, if some elements of { α } or { β } are not zero, then function S has multitudes of additional singularities and cutlines in the complex plane, due to the exponential growth of sin and cos along the imaginary axis; the smaller the coefficients { α } and { β } are, the further away these singularities are from the real axis.  The extension of tetration into the complex plane is thus essential for the uniqueness; the real-analytic tetration is not unique.  Open questions   It is not known whether n    e   e   e    or n    π   π   \pi    is an integer for any positive integer n . Particularly, it is not known whether 4      y    n   =  x       superscript  y  n   x    {}^{n}y=x   is an integer.  It is not known whether n q is an integer for any positive integer n and positive non-integer rational q . 13 Particularly, it is not known whether the positive root of the equation is a rational number.   Inverse relations  Exponentiation has two inverse relations; roots and logarithms . Analogously, the inverse relations of tetration are often called the super-root , and the super-logarithm .  Super-root  The super-root is the inverse relation of tetration with respect to the base: if     2    4   =   2   2   2  2     =  65  ,  536     fragments   superscript  2  4     superscript  2   superscript  2   superscript  2  2      65  normal-,  536    {}^{4}2=2^{2^{2^{2}}}=65,536   , then y is an n th super root of x . For example,       3    3   =   3   3  3    =  7  ,  625  ,  597  ,  484  ,  987     fragments   superscript  3  3     superscript  3   superscript  3  3     7  normal-,  625  normal-,  597  normal-,  484  normal-,  987    {}^{3}3=3^{3^{3}}=7,625,597,484,987     so 2 is the 4th super-root of 65,536 and      ssrt   (  x  )       ssrt  x    \mathrm{ssrt}(x)     so 3 is the 3rd super-root (or super cube root) of 7,625,597,484,987.  Square super-root  The 2nd-order super-root , square super-root , or super square root has two equivalent notations,     x   s     subscript    x   s    \sqrt{x}_{s}   and     x    2   =   x  x        superscript  x  2    superscript  x  x     {}^{2}x=x^{x}   . It is the inverse of     ssrt   (  x  )    =   e   W   (   ln   (  x  )    )     =    ln   (  x  )     W   (   ln   (  x  )    )             ssrt  x    superscript  e    W    ln  x              ln  x     W    ln  x        \mathrm{ssrt}(x)=e^{W(\mathrm{ln}(x))}=\frac{\mathrm{ln}(x)}{W(\mathrm{ln}(x))}   and can be represented with the Lambert W function : 14      y  =   ssrt   (  x  )        y    ssrt  x     y=\mathrm{ssrt}(x)     The function also illustrates the reflective nature of the root and logarithm functions as the equation below only holds true when     x  y   =    log  y   x          y   x     subscript   y   x     \sqrt[y]{x}=\log_{y}x   :      e   -   1  /  e       superscript  e      1  e      e^{-1/e}     Like square roots , the square super-root of x may not have a single solution. Unlike square roots, determining the number of square super-roots of x may be difficult. In general, if     x  n   s     subscript     n   x   s    \sqrt[n]{x}_{s}   , then x has one positive square super-root greater than 1. If x is positive and less than    x  =   y   y  y        x   superscript  y   superscript  y  y      x=y^{y^{y}}   it doesn't have any real square super-roots, but the formula given above yields countably infinitely many complex ones for any finite x not equal to 1. 15 The function has been used to determine the size of data clusters . 16  Other super-roots  For each integer , the function n x is defined and increasing for , and , so that the n th super-root of x ,     x  3   s     subscript     3   x   s    \sqrt[3]{x}_{s}   , exists for .  However, if the linear approximation above is used, then if −1  ^y \sqrt{y + 1}_s }} cannot exist.  Other super-roots are expressible under the same basis used with normal roots : super cube roots, the function that produces y when     x  4   s     subscript     4   x   s    \sqrt[4]{x}_{s}   , can be expressed as     x  n   s     subscript     n   x   s    \sqrt[n]{x}_{s}   ; the 4th super-root can be expressed as     x  n   s     subscript     n   x   s    \sqrt[n]{x}_{s}   ; and it can therefore be said that the n th super-root is    n  =  ∞      n     n=\infty   . Note that    x  =   y    ∞       x   superscript  y      x={{}^{\infty}y}   may not be uniquely defined, because there may be more than one n th root. For example, x has a single (real) super-root if n is odd , and up to two if n is even .  The super-root can be extended to     x  =   y  x    ,      x   superscript  y  x     x=y^{x},   , and this shows a link to the mathematical constant e as it is only well-defined if 1/ e ≤ x ≤ e (see extension of tetration to infinite heights ). Note that    y  =   x   1  /  x        y   superscript  x    1  x      y=x^{1/x}   implies that      x  ∞   s   =   x   1  /  x         subscript       x   s    superscript  x    1  x      \sqrt[\infty]{x}_{s}=x^{1/x}   and thus that      2  ∞   s   =   2   1  /  2    =   2          subscript       2   s    superscript  2    1  2           2      \sqrt[\infty]{2}_{s}=2^{1/2}=\sqrt{2}   . Therefore, when it is well defined,     n   s     subscript    n   s    \sqrt{n}_{s}   and thus it is an elementary function . For example,     n  3   s     subscript     3   n   s    \sqrt[3]{n}_{s}   .  It follows from the Gelfond–Schneider theorem that super-root     slog  a   x       subscript  slog  a   x    \mathrm{slog}_{a}{x}   for any positive integer n is either integer or transcendental , and      slog  a    a    x    =  x         subscript  slog  a    superscript  a  x    x    \mathrm{slog}_{a}{{}^{x}a}=x   is either integer or irrational. 17 But it is still an open question whether irrational super-roots are transcendental in the latter case.  Super-logarithm  Once a continuous increasing (in x ) definition of tetration, x a , is selected, the corresponding super-logarithm is defined for all real numbers x , and .  The function      slog  a    a  x    =   1  +    slog  a   x           subscript  slog  a    superscript  a  x      1     subscript  slog  a   x      \mathrm{slog}_{a}a^{x}=1+\mathrm{slog}_{a}x   satisfies:        slog  a   x   =   1  +    slog  a     log  a   x            subscript  slog  a   x     1     subscript  slog  a     subscript   a   x       \mathrm{slog}_{a}x=1+\mathrm{slog}_{a}\log_{a}x           slog  a   x   >   -  2          subscript  slog  a   x     2     \mathrm{slog}_{a}x>-2         y  =   x   [   x   [   x   (  ⋯  )    ]    ]        y   superscript  x   delimited-[]   superscript  x   delimited-[]    x  normal-⋯         y=x^{[x^{[x(\cdots)]}]}          a    n      superscript  a  n    \ {{}^{n}a}     See also   Ackermann function  Double exponential function  Hyperoperation  Iterated logarithm  Symmetric level-index arithmetic   References   Daniel Geisler, tetration.org  Ioannis Galidakis, On extending hyper4 to nonintegers (undated, 2006 or earlier) (A simpler, easier to read review of the next reference)  Ioannis Galidakis, On Extending hyper4 and Knuth's Up-arrow Notation to the Reals (undated, 2006 or earlier).
