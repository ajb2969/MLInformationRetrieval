Putrescine oxidase

In enzymology, a putrescine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

putrescine + O2 + H2O 
 
 
 
  4-aminobutanal + NH3 + H2O2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are putrescine, O2, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are 4-aminobutanal, NH3, and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is putrescine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating). This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
