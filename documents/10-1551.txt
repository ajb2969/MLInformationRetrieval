   Putrescine oxidase      Putrescine oxidase   In enzymology , a putrescine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   putrescine + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-aminobutanal + NH 3 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are putrescine , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 4-aminobutanal , NH 3 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is putrescine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating) . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups . It employs one cofactor , FAD .
