   Unique prime      Unique prime   In number theory , a unique prime is a certain kind of prime number . A prime p ≠ 2, 5 is called unique if there is no other prime q such that the period length of the decimal expansion of its reciprocal , 1 / p , is equivalent to the period length of the reciprocal of q , 1 / q . 1 For example, 3 is the only prime with period 1, 11 is the only prime with period 2, 37 is the only prime with period 3, 101 is the only prime with period 4, so they are unique primes. In contrast, 41 and 271 both have period 5; 7 and 13 both have period 6; 239 and 4649 both have period 7; 73 and 137 both have period 8. Therefore, none of these is a unique prime. Unique primes were first described by Samuel Yates in 1980.  It can be shown that a prime p is of unique period n  if and only if there exists a natural number  c such that         Φ  n    (  10  )     gcd   (    Φ  n    (  10  )    ,  n  )     =   p  c            subscript  normal-Φ  n   10        subscript  normal-Φ  n   10   n     superscript  p  c     \frac{\Phi_{n}(10)}{\gcd(\Phi_{n}(10),n)}=p^{c}     where Φ n ( x ) is the n -th cyclotomic polynomial . At present, more than fifty unique primes or probable primes are known. However, there are only twenty-three unique primes below 10 100 . The following table gives an overview of all 23 unique primes below 10 100 (sequence  (sorted) and  (ordered by period length) in OEIS ) and their periods (sequence  (ordered by corresponding primes) and  (sorted) in OEIS )      Period length   Prime       1   3     2   11     3   37     4   101     10   9,091     12   9,901     9   333,667     14   909,091     24   99,990,001     36   999,999,000,001     48   9,999,999,900,000,001     38   909,090,909,090,909,091     19   1,111,111,111,111,111,111     23   11,111,111,111,111,111,111,111     39   900,900,900,900,990,990,990,991     62   909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,091     120   100,009,999,999,899,989,999,000,000,010,001     150   10,000,099,999,999,989,999,899,999,000,000,000,100,001     106   9,090, 909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,091     93   900,900,900,900, 900,900,900,900,900,900,990,990,990,990,990,990,990,990,990,991     134   909,090,909,090,909,090, 909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,090,909,091     294   142,857,157,142,857,142,856,999,999,985,714,285, 714,285,857,142,857,142,855,714,285,571,428,571,428,572,857,143     196   999,999,999,999,990,000,000,000,000,099,999,999, 999,999,000,000,000,000,009,999,999,999,999,900,000,000,000,001     The prime with period length 294 is similar to the reciprocal of 7 (0.142857142857142857...)  Just after the table, the twenty-fourth unique prime has 128 digits and period length 320. It can be written as (9 32 0 32 ) 2 + 1, where a subscript number n indicates n consecutive copies of the digit or group of digits before the subscript.  Though they are rare, based on the occurrence of repunit primes and probable primes, it is conjectured strongly that there are infinitely many unique primes. (Any repunit prime is unique.)  the repunit (10 270343 -1)/9 is the largest known probable unique prime. 2  In 1996 the largest proven unique prime was (10 1132 + 1)/10001 or, using the notation above, (99990000) 141 + 1. It has 1129 digits. The record has been improved many times since then.  the largest proven unique prime is     Φ  47498    (  10  )        subscript  normal-Φ  47498   10    \Phi_{47498}(10)   , it has 20160 digits. 3  Binary unique primes  The first unique primes in binary (base 2) are:   3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 31, 41, 43, 73, 127, 151, 241, 257, 331, 337, 683, ... (sequence  (sorted) and  (ordered by period length) in OEIS )   The period length of them are:   2, 4, 3, 10, 12, 8, 18, 5, 20, 14, 9, 7, 15, 24, 16, 30, 21, 22, ... (sequence  (ordered by corresponding primes) and  (sorted) in OEIS)   They include Fermat primes (the period length is a power of 2 ), Mersenne primes (the period length is a prime ) and Wagstaff primes (the period length is twice an odd prime ).  Additionally, if n is a natural number which is not equal to 1 or 6, than at least one prime have period n in base 2, because of the Zsigmondy theorem . Besides, if n is congruent to 4 (mod 8) and n > 20, then at least two primes have period n in base 2, (Thus, n is not a unique period in base 2) because of the Aurifeuillean factorization , for example, 113 (=     Φ   28  L     (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ    28  L    2    \Phi_{28L}(2)   ) and 29 (=     Φ   28  M     (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ    28  M    2    \Phi_{28M}(2)   ) both have period 28 in base 2, 37 (=     Φ   36  L     (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ    36  L    2    \Phi_{36L}(2)   ) and 109 (=     Φ   36  M     (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ    36  M    2    \Phi_{36M}(2)   ) both have period 36 in base 2, and that 397 (=     Φ   44  L     (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ    44  L    2    \Phi_{44L}(2)   ) and 2113 (=     Φ   44  M     (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ    44  M    2    \Phi_{44M}(2)   ) both have period 44 in base 2,  It can be shown that a prime p is of unique period n in base 2 if and only if there exists a natural number  c such that         Φ  n    (  2  )     gcd   (    Φ  n    (  2  )    ,  n  )     =   p  c            subscript  normal-Φ  n   2        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2   n     superscript  p  c     \frac{\Phi_{n}(2)}{\gcd(\Phi_{n}(2),n)}=p^{c}     where     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   is the n th cyclotomic polynomial at 2, because if and only if a prime p divides      Φ  n    (  2  )     gcd   (    Φ  n    (  2  )    ,  n  )           subscript  normal-Φ  n   2        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2   n     \frac{\Phi_{n}(2)}{\gcd(\Phi_{n}(2),n)}   , then the period length of    1  p      1  p    \frac{1}{p}   in base 2 is n .  The only known values of n such that     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   is composite but      Φ  n    (  2  )     gcd   (    Φ  n    (  2  )    ,  n  )           subscript  normal-Φ  n   2        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2   n     \frac{\Phi_{n}(2)}{\gcd(\Phi_{n}(2),n)}   is prime is 18, 20, 21, 54, 147, 342, 602, and 889 (If so,     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   must have a small factor which is also a factor of n ), and might have other terms (However, it is a conjecture that there is no others). Thus, they are also unique period length in base 2, but the corresponding primes of them are not of the form     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   , and all other base 2 unique primes are of the form     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   .  In fact, there are no primes which c > 1 (means it is a true power of p ) have been discovered, all known unique primes p have that c = 1. It is conjectured that all unique primes have that c = 1 (That is, all base 2 unique primes are not Wieferich primes), and it is very possible, because it's very possible that all     Φ  n    (  2  )        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2    \Phi_{n}(2)   are square-free except while n = 364 or n = 1755, if 1093 and 3511 are only two Wieferich primes (1093 and 3511 are only two known Wieferich primes, and neither 1093 nor 3511 is unique in base 2, that is, neither 364 nor 1755 is a unique period in base 2), and even if there are other Wieferich prime, they are rare!  The largest known base 2 unique prime is 2 57885161 -1, it is also the largest known prime. With an exception of Mersenne primes, the largest known probable base 2 unique prime is      2  13372531   +  1   3         superscript  2  13372531   1   3    \frac{2^{13372531}+1}{3}   , 4 and the largest proved base 2 unique prime is      2  42737   +  1   3         superscript  2  42737   1   3    \frac{2^{42737}+1}{3}   . Besides, the largest known probable base 2 unique prime which is not Mersenne prime or Wagstaff prime is      16  1025393   +  1   17         superscript  16  1025393   1   17    \frac{16^{1025393}+1}{17}   .  Similar to base 10, though they are rare (but more than the case to base 10), it is conjectured strongly that there are infinitely many base 2 unique primes, because all Mersenne primes are unique in base 2, and Mersenne primes are conjectured to be infinitely.  They divide none of overpseudoprimes to base 2, but every other odd prime number divide one overpseudoprime to base 2, because if and only if a conposite number can be written as      Φ  n    (  2  )     gcd   (    Φ  n    (  2  )    ,  n  )           subscript  normal-Φ  n   2        subscript  normal-Φ  n   2   n     \frac{\Phi_{n}(2)}{\gcd(\Phi_{n}(2),n)}   , it is an overpseudoprime to base 2.  There are 52 unique primes in base 2 below 2 64 , they are:      Period length   Prime   Base 2       2   3   11     4   5   101     3   7   111     10   11   1011     12   13   1101     8   17   1 0001     18   19   1 0011     5   31   1 1111     20   41   10 1001     14   43   10 1011     9   73   100 1001     7   127   111 1111     15   151   1001 0111     24   241   1111 0001     16   257   1 0000 0001     30   331   1 0100 1011     21   337   1 0101 0001     22   683   10 1010 1011     26   2,731   1010 1010 1011     42   5,419   1 0101 0010 1011     13   8,191   1 1111 1111 1111     34   43,691   1010 1010 1010 1011     40   61,681   1111 0000 1111 0001     32   65,537   1 0000 0000 0000 0001     54   87,211   1 0101 0100 1010 1011     17   131,071   1 1111 1111 1111 1111     38   174,763   10 1010 1010 1010 1011     27   262,657   100 0000 0010 0000 0001     19   524,287   111 1111 1111 1111 1111     33   599,479   1001 0010 0101 1011 0111     46   2,796,203   10 1010 1010 1010 1010 1011     56   15,790,321   1111 0000 1111 0000 1111 0001     90   18,837,001   1 0001 1111 0110 1110 0000 1001     78   22,366,891   1 0101 0101 0100 1010 1010 1011     62   715,827,883   10 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1011     31   2,147,483,647   111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111     80   4,278,255,361   1111 1111 0000 0000 1111 1111 0000 0001     120   4,562,284,561   1 0000 1111 1110 1110 1111 0000 0001 0001     126   77,158,673,929   1 0001 1111 0111 0000 0011 1110 1110 0000 1001     150   1,133,836,730,401   1 0000 0111 1111 1101 1110 1111 1000 0000 0010 0001     86   2,932,031,007,403   10 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1011     98   4,363,953,127,297   11 1111 1000 0000 1111 1110 0000 0011 1111 1000 0001     49   4,432,676,798,593   100 0000 1000 0001 0000 0010 0000 0100 0000 1000 0001     69   10,052,678,938,039   1001 0010 0100 1001 0010 0101 1011 0110 1101 1011 0111     65   145,295,143,558,111   1000 0100 0010 0101 0010 1001 0110 1011 0101 1011 1101 1111     174   96,076,791,871,613,611   1 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0101 0100 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1011     77   581,283,643,249,112,959   1000 0001 0001 0010 0010 0110 0100 1100 1101 1001 1011 1011 0111 0111 1111     93   658,812,288,653,553,079   1001 0010 0100 1001 0010 0100 1001 0011 0110 1101 1011 0110 1101 1011 0111     122   768,614,336,404,564,651   1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1010 1011     61   2,305,843,009,213,693,951   1 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111     85   9,520,972,806,333,758,431   1000 0100 0010 0001 0100 1010 0101 0010 1011 0101 1010 1101 0111 1011 1101 1111     192   18,446,744,069,414,584,321   1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001     After the table, the next 10 base 2 unique prime have period length 170, 234, 158, 165, 147, 129, 184, 89, 208, and 312, and the bits of them are 65, 73, 78, 81, 82, 84, 88, 89, 96, and 97.
