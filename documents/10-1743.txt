1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane 
 
 
 
  1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene + chloride

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane, and two products, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene and chloride.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-halide lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane chloride-lyase [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene-forming]. Other names in common use include DDT-ase, 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane chloride-lyase, and DDTase. This enzyme participates in 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and .
