   Four-force      Four-force   In the special theory of relativity  four-force is a four-vector that replaces the classical force .  In Special Relativity  The four-force is the four-vector defined as the change in four-momentum over the particle's own time :      𝐅  =    d  𝐏    d  τ        𝐅      d  𝐏     d  τ      \mathbf{F}={d\mathbf{P}\over d\tau}   .  For a particle of constant invariant mass  m > 0,    𝐏  =   m   𝐔        𝐏    m  𝐔     \mathbf{P}=m\mathbf{U}\,   where    𝐔  =   γ   (  c  ,  𝐮  )        𝐔    γ   c  𝐮      \mathbf{U}=\gamma(c,\mathbf{u})\,   is the four-velocity , so we can relate the four-force with the four-acceleration    𝐀   𝐀   \mathbf{A}   as in Newton's second law :      𝐅  =   m  𝐀   =   (   γ    𝐟  ⋅  𝐮   c    ,   γ  𝐟   )         𝐅    m  𝐀           γ     normal-⋅  𝐟  𝐮   c      γ  𝐟       \mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{A}=\left(\gamma{\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{u}\over c},\gamma{%
 \mathbf{f}}\right)   .  Here      𝐟  =    d   d  t     (   γ  m  𝐮   )    =    d  𝐩    d  t          𝐟      d    d  t      γ  m  𝐮             d  𝐩     d  t       {\mathbf{f}}={d\over dt}\left(\gamma m{\mathbf{u}}\right)={d\mathbf{p}\over dt}     and       𝐟  ⋅  𝐮   =    d   d  t     (   γ  m   c  2    )    =    d  E    d  t           normal-⋅  𝐟  𝐮       d    d  t      γ  m   superscript  c  2              d  E     d  t       {\mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{u}}={d\over dt}\left(\gamma mc^{2}\right)={dE\over dt}   .  where   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   ,   𝐩   𝐩   \mathbf{p}   and   𝐟   𝐟   \mathbf{f}   are 3-vectors describing the velocity and the momentum of the particle and the force acting on it respectively.  In General Relativity  In general relativity the relation between four-force, and four-acceleration remains the same, but the elements of the four-force are related to the elements of the four-momentum through a covariant derivative with respect to proper time.       F  λ   :=    D   P  λ     d  τ    =     d   P  λ     d  τ    +    Γ  λ    U   μ    μ  ν      P  ν          assign   superscript  F  λ       D   superscript  P  λ      d  τ               d   superscript  P  λ      d  τ       superscript  normal-Γ  λ    subscript   superscript  U  μ     μ  ν     superscript  P  ν        F^{\lambda}:=\frac{DP^{\lambda}}{d\tau}=\frac{dP^{\lambda}}{d\tau}+\Gamma^{%
 \lambda}{}_{\mu\nu}U^{\mu}P^{\nu}     In addition, we can formulate force using the concept of coordinate transformations between different coordinate systems. Assume that we know the correct expression for force in a coordinate system at which the particle is momentarily at rest. Then we can perform a transformation to another system to get the corresponding expression of force. 1 In special relativity the transformation will be a Lorentz transformation between coordinate systems moving with a relative constant velocity whereas in general relativity it will be a general coordinate transformation.  Consider the four-force     F  μ   =   (   F  0   ,  𝐅  )        superscript  F  μ     superscript  F  0   𝐅     F^{\mu}=(F^{0},\mathbf{F})   acting on a particle of mass   m   m   m   which is momentarily at rest in a coordinate system. The relativistic force    f  μ     superscript  f  μ    f^{\mu}   in another coordinate system moving with constant velocity   v   v   v   , relative to the other one, is obtained using a Lorentz transformation:       𝐟  =   𝐅  +    (   γ  -  1   )   𝐯    𝐯  ⋅  𝐅    v  2       ,      𝐟    𝐅      γ  1   𝐯     normal-⋅  𝐯  𝐅    superscript  v  2        {\mathbf{f}}={\mathbf{F}}+(\gamma-1){\mathbf{v}}{{\mathbf{v}}\cdot{\mathbf{F}}%
 \over v^{2}},         f  0   =    γ  𝜷   ⋅  𝐅   =   𝜷  ⋅  𝐟    .         superscript  f  0    normal-⋅    γ  𝜷   𝐅         normal-⋅  𝜷  𝐟      f^{0}=\gamma\boldsymbol{\beta}\cdot\mathbf{F}=\boldsymbol{\beta}\cdot\mathbf{f}.     where    𝜷  =   𝐯  /  c       𝜷    𝐯  c     \boldsymbol{\beta}=\mathbf{v}/c   .  In general relativity , the expression for force becomes       f  μ   =   m    D   U  μ     d  τ          superscript  f  μ     m      D   superscript  U  μ      d  τ       f^{\mu}=m{DU^{\mu}\over d\tau}     with covariant derivative      D  /  d   τ        D  d   τ    D/d\tau   . The equation of motion becomes        m     d  2    x  μ     d   τ  2      =    f  μ   -   m   Γ   ν  λ   μ     d   x  ν     d  τ      d   x  λ     d  τ       ,        m       superscript  d  2    superscript  x  μ      d   superscript  τ  2         superscript  f  μ     m   subscript   superscript  normal-Γ  μ     ν  λ        d   superscript  x  ν      d  τ        d   superscript  x  λ      d  τ        m{d^{2}x^{\mu}\over d\tau^{2}}=f^{\mu}-m\Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\lambda}{dx^{\nu}%
 \over d\tau}{dx^{\lambda}\over d\tau},     where    Γ   ν  λ   μ     subscript   superscript  normal-Γ  μ     ν  λ     \Gamma^{\mu}_{\nu\lambda}   is the Christoffel symbol . If there is no external force, this becomes the equation for geodesics in the curved space-time . The second term in the above equation, plays the role of a gravitational force. If    f  f  α     subscript   superscript  f  α   f    f^{\alpha}_{f}   is the correct expression for force in a freely falling frame    ξ  α     superscript  ξ  α    \xi^{\alpha}   , we can use the then the equivalence principle to write the four-force in an arbitrary coordinate    x  μ     superscript  x  μ    x^{\mu}   :        f  μ   =     ∂   x  μ     ∂   ξ  α      f  f  α     .       superscript  f  μ          superscript  x  μ       superscript  ξ  α      subscript   superscript  f  α   f      f^{\mu}={\partial x^{\mu}\over\partial\xi^{\alpha}}f^{\alpha}_{f}.     Examples  In special relativity, Lorentz 4-force (4-force acting to charged particle situated in electromagnetic field) can be expressed as:       F  μ   =   q   F   μ  ν     U  ν         subscript  F  μ     q   subscript  F    μ  ν     superscript  U  ν      F_{\mu}=qF_{\mu\nu}U^{\nu}   ,  where       F   μ  ν      subscript  F    μ  ν     F_{\mu\nu}   is electromagnetic tensor ,      U  ν     superscript  U  ν    U^{\nu}   is 4-velocity , and     q   q   q   - electric charge .
