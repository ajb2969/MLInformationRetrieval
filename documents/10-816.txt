Precorrin-4 C11-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a precorrin-4 C11-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-4 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-5
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and precorrin 4, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and precorrin 5.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-4 C11 methyltransferase. Other names in common use include precorrin-3 methylase, and CobM. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
