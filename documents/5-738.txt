   Lie ring      Lie ring   In mathematics a Lie ring is a structure related to Lie algebras that can arise as a generalisation of Lie algebras, or through the study of the lower central series of groups .  Lie rings need not be Lie groups under addition. Any Lie algebra is an example of a Lie ring. Any associative ring can be made into a Lie ring by defining a bracket operator     [  x  ,  y  ]   =    x  y   -   y  x         x  y       x  y     y  x      [x,y]=xy-yx   . Conversely to any Lie algebra there is a corresponding ring, called the universal enveloping algebra .  Lie rings are used in the study of finite p-groups through the Lazard correspondence . The lower central factors of a p -group are finite abelian p -groups, so modules over Z / p Z . The direct sum of the lower central factors is given the structure of a Lie ring by defining the bracket to be the commutator of two coset representatives. The Lie ring structure is enriched with another module homomorphism, then p th power map, making the associated Lie ring a so-called restricted Lie ring.  Lie rings are also useful in the definition of a p-adic analytic groups and their endomorphisms by studying Lie algebras over rings of integers such as the p-adic integers . The definition of finite groups of Lie type due to Chevalley involves restricting from a Lie algebra over the complex numbers to a Lie algebra over the integers, and the reducing modulo p to get a Lie algebra over a finite field.  Formal definition  A Lie ring is defined as a nonassociative ring with multiplication that is anticommutative and satisfies the Jacobi identity . More specifically we can define a Lie ring   L   L   L   to be an abelian group with an operation    [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    [\cdot,\cdot]   that has the following properties:   Bilinearity:           [   x  +  y   ,  z  ]   =    [  x  ,  z  ]   +   [  y  ,  z  ]     ,    [  z  ,   x  +  y   ]   =    [  z  ,  x  ]   +   [  z  ,  y  ]        formulae-sequence       x  y   z      x  z    y  z        z    x  y       z  x    z  y       [x+y,z]=[x,z]+[y,z],\quad[z,x+y]=[z,x]+[z,y]         for all x , y , z ∈ L .    The Jacobi identity :            [  x  ,   [  y  ,  z  ]   ]   +   [  y  ,   [  z  ,  x  ]   ]   +   [  z  ,   [  x  ,  y  ]   ]    =  0          x   y  z     y   z  x     z   x  y     0    [x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0\quad         for all x , y , z in L .    For all x in L :           [  x  ,  x  ]   =  0        x  x   0    [x,x]=0\quad        Examples   Any Lie algebra over a general ring instead of a field is an example of a Lie ring. Lie rings are not  Lie groups under addition, despite the name.    Any associative ring can be made into a Lie ring by defining a bracket operator     [  x  ,  y  ]   =    x  y   -   y  x         x  y       x  y     y  x      [x,y]=xy-yx   .    For an example of a Lie ring arising from the study of groups , let   G   G   G   be a group with     (  x  ,  y  )   =    x   -  1     y   -  1    x  y        x  y      superscript  x    1     superscript  y    1    x  y     (x,y)=x^{-1}y^{-1}xy   the commutator operation, and let    G  =   G  0   ⊇   G  1   ⊇   G  2   ⊇  ⋯  ⊇   G  n   ⊇  ⋯        G   subscript  G  0     superset-of-or-equals     subscript  G  1     superset-of-or-equals     subscript  G  2     superset-of-or-equals    normal-⋯    superset-of-or-equals     subscript  G  n     superset-of-or-equals    normal-⋯     G=G_{0}\supseteq G_{1}\supseteq G_{2}\supseteq\cdots\supseteq G_{n}\supseteq\cdots   be a central series in   G   G   G   — that is the commutator subgroup    (   G  i   ,   G  j   )      subscript  G  i    subscript  G  j     (G_{i},G_{j})   is contained in    G   i  +  j      subscript  G    i  j     G_{i+j}   for any    i  ,  j     i  j    i,j   . Then         L  =   ⊕    G  i   /   G   i  +  1          L   direct-sum     subscript  G  i    subscript  G    i  1        L=\bigoplus G_{i}/G_{i+1}         is a Lie ring with addition supplied by the group operation (which will be commutative in each homogeneous part), and the bracket operation given by          [   x   G  i    ,   y   G  j    ]   =    (  x  ,  y  )    G   i  +  j            x   subscript  G  i      y   subscript  G  j        x  y    subscript  G    i  j       [xG_{i},yG_{j}]=(x,y)G_{i+j}         extended linearly. Note that the centrality of the series ensures the commutator    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   gives the bracket operation the appropriate Lie theoretic properties.
