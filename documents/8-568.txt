Hack's law

Hack's law is an empirical relationship between the length of streams and the area of their basins. If L is the length of the longest stream in a basin, and A is the area of the basin, then Hack's law may be written as



for some constant C where the exponent h is slightly less than 0.6 in most basins. Note that h varies slightly from region to region, and also slightly decreases for larger basins (>8,000 mi², or 20,720 km²). A theoretical value h = 4/7 ≈ 0.571 for the exponent has been derived (Birnir, 2008).
