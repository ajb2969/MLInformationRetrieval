Dihydrocoumarin hydrolase

In enzymology, a dihydrocoumarin hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

dihydrocoumarin + H2O 
 
 
 
  melilotate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dihydrocoumarin and H2O, whereas its product is melilotate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dihydrocoumarin lactonohydrolase. This enzyme participates in fluorene degradation.
