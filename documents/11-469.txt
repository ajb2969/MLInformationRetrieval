   Dihydrocoumarin hydrolase      Dihydrocoumarin hydrolase   In enzymology , a dihydrocoumarin hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dihydrocoumarin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   melilotate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dihydrocoumarin and H 2 O , whereas its product is melilotate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dihydrocoumarin lactonohydrolase . This enzyme participates in fluorene degradation .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
