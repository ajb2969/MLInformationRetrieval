Mean dependence

In probability theory, a random variable Y is said to be mean independent of random variable X if and only if E(Y|X) = E(Y) for all x such that ƒ1(x) is not equal to zero. Y is said to be mean dependent if E(Y|X) ≠ μ(y) for some x such that ƒ1(x) is not equal to zero.
According to  and , Stochastic independence implies mean independence, but the converse is not necessarily true.
Moreover, mean independence implies uncorrelation while the converse is not necessarily true.
The concept of mean independence is often used in econometrics to have a middle ground between the strong assumption of independent distributions 
 
 
 
  and the weak assumption of uncorrelated variables 
 
 
 
  of a pair of random variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If X, Y are two different random variables such that X is mean independent of Y and Z=f(X), which means that Z is a function only of X, then Y and Z are mean independent.
