Quartet distance

The quartet distance is a way of measuring the distance between two phylogenetic trees. It is defined as the number of subsets of four leaves that are not related by the same topology in both trees.
Computing the quartet distance
The most straightforward computation of the quartet distance would require 
 
 
 
  time, where 
 
 
 
  is the number of leaves in the trees.
For binary trees, better algorithms have been found to compute the distance in



 
  time1


 
  time2

and



 
  time3

Christiansen et al. found an algorithm that takes 
 
 
 
  time to compute the quartet distance between two multifurcating trees when 
 
 
 
  is the maximum degree of the trees.4
