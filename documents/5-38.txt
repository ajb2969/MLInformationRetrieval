   Permeance      Permeance   Permeance , in general, is the degree to which a material admits a flow of matter or energy . Permeance is usually represented by a curly (calligraphic) capital P   𝒫   𝒫   \mathcal{P}   , or capital lambda Λ.  Electromagnetism  In electromagnetism , permeance is the inverse of reluctance . Permeance is a measure of the quantity of flux for a number of current-turns in magnetic circuit. A magnetic circuit almost acts as though the flux is 'conducted', therefore permeance is larger for large cross sections of a material and smaller for longer lengths. This concept is analogous to electrical conductance in the electric circuit .  Magnetic permeance   𝒫   𝒫   \mathcal{P}   is defined as the reciprocal of magnetic reluctance   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   (in analogy with the reciprocity between electric conductance and resistance):      𝒫  =   1  ℛ       𝒫    1  ℛ     \mathcal{P}=\frac{1}{\mathcal{R}}     which can also be re-written:      𝒫  =    Φ  B    N  I        𝒫     subscript  normal-Φ  B     N  I      \mathcal{P}=\frac{\Phi_{B}}{NI}     using Hopkinson's law (magnetic circuit analogue of Ohm's law for electric circuits) and the definition of magnetomotive force (magnetic analogue of electromotive force ):      ℱ  =    Φ  B   ℛ   =   N  I         ℱ     subscript  normal-Φ  B   ℛ          N  I      \mathcal{F}=\Phi_{B}\mathcal{R}=NI     Where:  Φ B = Magnetic flux  NI = Current-turns, (current) × (number of turns of conductor to make a coil).  Alternatively in terms of magnetic permeability (analogous to electric conductance):      𝒫  =    μ  A   ℓ       𝒫      μ  A   normal-ℓ     \mathcal{P}=\frac{\mu A}{\ell}     Where:  μ = Permeability of material  A = Cross-sectional area    ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   = magnetic path length  The SI unit of magnetic permeance is "webers per ampere-turn", that is Wb A −1 .
