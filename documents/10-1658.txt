   Isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase      Isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase   In enzymology , an isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta-isomerase (, see also: Isopentenyl Pyrophosphate ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   isopentenyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dimethylallyl diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , isopentenyl diphosphate , and one product , dimethylallyl diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is isopentenyl-diphosphate Delta3-Delta2-isomerase . Other names in common use include isopentenylpyrophosphate Delta-isomerase , methylbutenylpyrophosphate isomerase , and isopentenylpyrophosphate isomerase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids and terpenoid biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 25 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
