Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase

Arachidonate 12-lipoxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

arachidonate + O2

 
  (5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-(12S)-12-hydroperoxyicosa-5,8,10,14-tetraenoate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are arachidonate and oxygen, whereas its product is (5Z,8Z,10E,14Z)-(12S)-12-hydroperoxyicosa-5,8,10,14-tetraenoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on single donors with O2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2. The systematic name of this enzyme class is arachidonate:oxygen 12-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include Delta12-lipoxygenase, 12-lipoxygenase, 12Delta-lipoxygenase, C-12 lipoxygenase, 12S-lipoxygenase, leukotriene A4 synthase, and LTA4 synthase. This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism. At least one compound, 3-methoxytropolone is known to inhibit this enzyme.
