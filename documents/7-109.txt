   Hagen–Poiseuille flow from the Navier–Stokes equations      Hagen–Poiseuille flow from the Navier–Stokes equations   In fluid dynamics , the derivation of the Hagen–Poiseuille flow from the Navier–Stokes equations shows how this flow is an exact solution to the Navier–Stokes equations . 1 2  Derivation  The laminar flow through a pipe of uniform (circular) cross-section is known as Hagen–Poiseuille flow. The equations governing the Hagen–Poiseuille flow can be derived directly from the Navier–Stokes momentum equations in 3D cylidrical coordinated by making the following set of assumptions:   The flow is steady (      ∂   (  …  )    /   ∂  t    =  0          normal-…     t    0    \partial(...)/\partial t=0   ).  The radial and swirl components of the fluid velocity are zero (     u  r   =   u  θ   =  0         subscript  u  r    subscript  u  θ        0     u_{r}=u_{\theta}=0   ).  The flow is axisymmetric (      ∂   (  …  )    /   ∂  θ    =  0          normal-…     θ    0    \partial(...)/\partial\theta=0   ) and fully developed (      ∂   u  z    /   ∂  z    =  0           subscript  u  z      z    0    \partial u_{z}/\partial z=0   ).   Then the angular equation in the momentum equations and the continuity equation are identically satisfied. The first momentum equation reduces to      ∂  p   /   ∂  r    =  0          p     r    0    \partial p/\partial r=0   , i.e., the pressure    p   p   p   is a function of the axial coordinate   z   z   z   only. The third momentum equation reduces to:        1  r    ∂   ∂  r     (   r    ∂   u  z     ∂  r     )    =    1  μ     ∂  p    ∂  z             1  r        r      r       subscript  u  z      r          1  μ       p     z       \frac{1}{r}\frac{\partial}{\partial r}\left(r\frac{\partial u_{z}}{\partial r}%
 \right)=\frac{1}{\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}   where   μ   μ   \mu   is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid.   The solution is       u  z   =     1   4  μ      ∂  p    ∂  z     r  2    +    c  1    ln  r    +   c  2         subscript  u  z         1    4  μ        p     z     superscript  r  2       subscript  c  1     r     subscript  c  2      u_{z}=\frac{1}{4\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}r^{2}+c_{1}\ln r+c_{2}      Since    u  z     subscript  u  z    u_{z}   needs to be finite at    r  =  0      r  0    r=0   ,     c  1   =  0       subscript  c  1   0    c_{1}=0   . The no slip boundary condition at the pipe wall requires that     u  z   =  0       subscript  u  z   0    u_{z}=0   at    r  =  R      r  R    r=R   (radius of the pipe), which yields        c  2   =   -    1   4  μ      ∂  p    ∂  z     R  2      .       subscript  c  2         1    4  μ        p     z     superscript  R  2       c_{2}=-\frac{1}{4\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}R^{2}.     Thus we have finally the following parabolic  velocity profile:        u  z   =   -    1   4  μ      ∂  p    ∂  z     (    R  2   -   r  2    )      .       subscript  u  z         1    4  μ        p     z       superscript  R  2    superscript  r  2        u_{z}=-\frac{1}{4\mu}\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}(R^{2}-r^{2}).     The maximum velocity occurs at the pipe centerline (    r  =  0      r  0    r=0   ):        u  z    m  a  x     =     R  2    4  μ     (   -    ∂  p    ∂  z     )     .       subscript   subscript  u  z     m  a  x         superscript  R  2     4  μ          p     z        {u_{z}}_{max}=\frac{R^{2}}{4\mu}\left(-\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}\right).     The average velocity can be obtained by integrating over the pipe cross section :        u  z   avg    =    1   π   R  2       ∫  0  R      u  z   ⋅  2   π  r  d  r     =   0.5   u  z   max      .         subscript   subscript  u  z   avg       1    π   superscript  R  2       superscript   subscript   0   R      normal-⋅   subscript  u  z   2   π  r  d  r            0.5   subscript   subscript  u  z   max       {u_{z}}_{\mathrm{avg}}=\frac{1}{\pi R^{2}}\int_{0}^{R}u_{z}\cdot 2\pi rdr=0.5{%
 u_{z}}_{\mathrm{max}}.     The Hagen–Poiseuille equation relates the pressure drop    Δ  p      normal-Δ  p    \Delta p   across a circular pipe of length   L   L   L   to the average flow velocity in the pipe    u  z   avg      subscript   subscript  u  z   avg    {u_{z}}_{\mathrm{avg}}   and other parameters. Assuming that the pressure decreases linearly across the length of the pipe, we have     -    ∂  p    ∂  z     =    Δ  p   L             p     z         normal-Δ  p   L     -\frac{\partial p}{\partial z}=\frac{\Delta p}{L}   (constant). Substituting this and the expression for    u  z   max      subscript   subscript  u  z   max    {u_{z}}_{\mathrm{max}}   into the expression for    u  z   avg      subscript   subscript  u  z   avg    {u_{z}}_{\mathrm{avg}}   , and noting that the pipe diameter    D  =   2  R       D    2  R     D=2R   , we get:        u  z    a  v  g     =     D  2    32  μ      Δ  p   L     .       subscript   subscript  u  z     a  v  g         superscript  D  2     32  μ        normal-Δ  p   L      {u_{z}}_{avg}=\frac{D^{2}}{32\mu}\frac{\Delta p}{L}.   Rearrangement of this gives the Hagen–Poiseuille equation:        Δ  p   =    32  μ   L    u  z   avg      D  2     .        normal-Δ  p       32  μ  L   subscript   subscript  u  z   avg     superscript  D  2      \Delta p=\frac{32\mu L~{}{u_{z}}_{\mathrm{avg}}}{D^{2}}.
