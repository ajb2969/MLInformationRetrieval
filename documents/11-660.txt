Acetylspermidine deacetylase




Acetylspermidine deacetylase

In enzymology, an acetylspermidine deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N8-acetylspermidine + H2O 
 
 
 
  acetate + spermidine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N8-acetylspermidine and H2O, whereas its two products are acetate and spermidine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N8-acetylspermidine amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include N8-monoacetylspermidine deacetylase, N8-acetylspermidine deacetylase, N-acetylspermidine deacetylase, N1-acetylspermidine amidohydrolase (incorrect), and 8-N-acetylspermidine amidohydrolase.
