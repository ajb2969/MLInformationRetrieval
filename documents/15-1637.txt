Pseudaminic acid cytidylyltransferase

Pseudaminic acid cytidylyltransferase (, PseF) is an enzyme with system name CTP:5,7-diacetamido-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-L-glycero-alpha-L-manno-nonulosonic acid cytidylyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

CTP + 5,7-bis(acetylamino)-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-L-glycero-alpha-L-manno-2-nonulopyranosonic acid 
 
 
diphosphate + CMP-5,7-bis(acetylamino)-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-L-glycero-alpha-L-manno-2-nonulopyranosonic acid
 

Mg2+ is required for activity.
