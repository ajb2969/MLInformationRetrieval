   Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation      Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation   The Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation 1 is an attempt to combine mathematically the ideas of quantum mechanics and general relativity , a step toward a theory of quantum gravity . In this approach, time plays no role in the equation, leading to the problem of time . 2 More specifically, the equation describes the quantum version of the Hamiltonian constraint using metric variables. Its commutation relations with the diffeomorphism constraints generate the Bergmann-Komar "group" (which is the diffeomorphism group  on-shell , but differs off-shell ).  Because of its connections with the low-energy effective field theory, it inherits all the problems of the naively quantized GR, and thus it cannot be used at multi-loop level, etc, at least not according to the current knowledge.  The equation has not played a role in string theory thus far, since all properly defined and understood descriptions of string/M-theory deal with some fixed asymptotic conditions on the background. Thus, at infinity, the "right" choice of the time coordinate "t" is determined in every description, so there is a preferred definition of the Hamiltonian (with nonzero eigenvalues) to evolve states of the system forward in time. This avoids all the issues of the Wheeler-de Witt equation to dynamically generate a time dimension.  But at the end, there could exist a Wheeler-de Witt style manner to describe the bulk dynamics of quantum theory of gravity. Some experts believe that this equation still holds the potential for understanding quantum gravity; however, decades after the equation was first written down, it has not brought physicists as clear results about quantum gravity as some of the results building on completely different approaches, such as string theory.  Motivation and background  In canonical gravity , spacetime is foliated into spacelike submanifolds. The three-metric (i.e., metric on the hypersurface) is    Œ≥   i  j      subscript  Œ≥    i  j     \gamma_{ij}   and given by          g   Œº  ŒΩ     d    x  Œº    d   x  ŒΩ    =     (    -   N  2    +    Œ≤  k    Œ≤  k     )   d   t  2    +   2    Œ≤  k    d    x  k    d  t   +     Œ≥   i  j     d    x  i    d   x  j      .         subscript  g    Œº  ŒΩ    normal-d   superscript  x  Œº   normal-d   superscript  x  ŒΩ             superscript  N  2       subscript  Œ≤  k    superscript  Œ≤  k     normal-d   superscript  t  2      2   subscript  Œ≤  k   normal-d   superscript  x  k   normal-d  t      subscript  Œ≥    i  j    normal-d   superscript  x  i   normal-d   superscript  x  j       g_{\mu\nu}\,\mathrm{d}x^{\mu}\,\mathrm{d}x^{\nu}=(-\,N^{2}+\beta_{k}\beta^{k})%
 \,\mathrm{d}t^{2}+2\beta_{k}\,\mathrm{d}x^{k}\,\mathrm{d}t+\gamma_{ij}\,%
 \mathrm{d}x^{i}\,\mathrm{d}x^{j}.   In that equation the Roman indices run over the values 1, 2, 3 and the Greek indices run over the values 1, 2, 3, 4. The three-metric    Œ≥   i  j      subscript  Œ≥    i  j     \gamma_{ij}   is the field, and we denote its conjugate momenta as    œÄ   k  l      superscript  œÄ    k  l     \pi^{kl}   . The Hamiltonian is a constraint (characteristic of most relativistic systems)      ‚Ñã  =     1   2   Œ≥      G   i  j  k  l     œÄ   i  j     œÄ   k  l     -     Œ≥     R     (  3  )      =  0        ‚Ñã        1    2    Œ≥      subscript  G    i  j  k  l     superscript  œÄ    i  j     superscript  œÄ    k  l         Œ≥    superscript  R  3          0     \mathcal{H}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\gamma}}G_{ijkl}\pi^{ij}\pi^{kl}-\sqrt{\gamma}\,{}%
 ^{(3)}\!R=0   where    Œ≥  =   det   (   Œ≥   i  j    )        Œ≥     subscript  Œ≥    i  j       \gamma=\det(\gamma_{ij})   and     G   i  j  k  l    =   (      Œ≥   i  k     Œ≥   j  l     +    Œ≥   i  l     Œ≥   j  k      -    Œ≥   i  j     Œ≥   k  l      )        subscript  G    i  j  k  l           subscript  Œ≥    i  k     subscript  Œ≥    j  l        subscript  Œ≥    i  l     subscript  Œ≥    j  k         subscript  Œ≥    i  j     subscript  Œ≥    k  l        G_{ijkl}=(\gamma_{ik}\gamma_{jl}+\gamma_{il}\gamma_{jk}-\gamma_{ij}\gamma_{kl})   is the Wheeler-DeWitt metric.  Quantization "puts hats" on the momenta and field variables; that is, the functions of numbers in the classical case become operators that modify the state function in the quantum case. Thus we obtain the operator        ‚Ñã  ^   =     1   2   Œ≥       G  ^    i  j  k  l      œÄ  ^    i  j      œÄ  ^    k  l     -     Œ≥      R  ^      (  3  )       .       normal-^  ‚Ñã         1    2    Œ≥      subscript   normal-^  G     i  j  k  l     superscript   normal-^  œÄ     i  j     superscript   normal-^  œÄ     k  l         Œ≥    superscript   normal-^  R   3       \widehat{\mathcal{H}}=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{\gamma}}\widehat{G}_{ijkl}\widehat{\pi}^%
 {ij}\widehat{\pi}^{kl}-\sqrt{\gamma}\,{}^{(3)}\!\widehat{R}.   Working in "position space", these operators are         Œ≥  ^    i  j     (  t  ,   x  k   )    ‚Üí    Œ≥   i  j     (  t  ,   x  k   )       normal-‚Üí     subscript   normal-^  Œ≥     i  j     t   superscript  x  k        subscript  Œ≥    i  j     t   superscript  x  k       \hat{\gamma}_{ij}(t,x^{k})\to\gamma_{ij}(t,x^{k})             œÄ  ^    i  j     (  t  ,   x  k   )    ‚Üí   -   i   Œ¥   Œ¥   Œ≥   i  j     (  t  ,   x  k   )        .     normal-‚Üí     superscript   normal-^  œÄ     i  j     t   superscript  x  k         i    Œ¥    Œ¥   subscript  Œ≥    i  j     t   superscript  x  k          \hat{\pi}^{ij}(t,x^{k})\to-i\frac{\delta}{\delta\gamma_{ij}(t,x^{k})}.     Derivation from path integral  The Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation can be derived from a path integral using the gravitational action in the Euclidean quantum gravity paradigm: 3      Z  =    ‚à´  C     e   -   I   [   g   Œº  ŒΩ    ,  œï  ]      ùíü   ùïò   ùíü  œï        Z    subscript   C      superscript  normal-e      I    subscript  g    Œº  ŒΩ    œï      ùíü  ùïò  ùíü  œï      Z=\int_{C}\mathrm{e}^{-I[g_{\mu\nu},\phi]}\mathcal{D}\mathbb{g}\,\mathcal{D}\phi     where one integrates over a class of Riemannian four-metrics and matter fields matching certain boundary conditions. Because the concept of a universal time coordinate seems unphysical, and at odds with the principles of general relativity , the action is evaluated around a 3-metric which we take as the boundary of the classes of four-metrics and on which a certain configuration of matter fields exists. This latter might for example be the current configuration of matter in our universe as we observe it today. Evaluating the action so that it only depends on the 3-metric and the matter fields is sufficient to remove the need for a time coordinate as it effectively fixes a point in the evolution of the universe.  We obtain the Hamiltonian constraint from        Œ¥   I   E  H      Œ¥  N    =  0          Œ¥   subscript  I    E  H       Œ¥  N    0    \frac{\delta I_{EH}}{\delta N}=0   where    I   E  H      subscript  I    E  H     I_{EH}   is the Einstein-Hilbert action, and   N   N   N   is the lapse function (i.e., the Lagrange multiplier for the Hamiltonian constraint). This is purely classical so far. We can recover the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation from        Œ¥  Z    Œ¥  N    =  0  =      ‚à´    Œ¥  I   [   g   Œº  ŒΩ    ,  œï  ]     Œ¥  N     |   Œ£    exp   (   -   I   [   g   Œº  ŒΩ    ,  œï  ]     )    ùíü   ùïò   ùíü  œï             Œ¥  Z     Œ¥  N    0          evaluated-at        Œ¥  I    subscript  g    Œº  ŒΩ    œï      Œ¥  N     normal-Œ£         I    subscript  g    Œº  ŒΩ    œï      ùíü  ùïò  ùíü  œï      \frac{\delta Z}{\delta N}=0=\int\left.\frac{\delta I[g_{\mu\nu},\phi]}{\delta N%
 }\right|_{\Sigma}\exp\left(-I[g_{\mu\nu},\phi]\right)\,\mathcal{D}\mathbb{g}\,%
 \mathcal{D}\phi   where   Œ£   normal-Œ£   \Sigma   is the three-dimensional boundary. Observe that this expression vanishes, implying that the functional derivative also vanishes, giving us the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation. A similar statement may be made for the diffeomorphism constraint (take functional derivative with respect to the shift functions instead).  Derivation from string theory  The Wheeler-de-Witt equation can be written in a form used in string theory. We think of the 3-manifolds as membranes in which the Universe lies. And the Wheeler-de-Witt equation describing the evolution of a membrane. 4         <    g  1   ,   œï  1    |    g  2    ,   œï  2    ‚â•   ‚à´   Œ®   [   g  1   ,   œï  1   ]    Œ®  ¬Ø    [   g  2   ,   œï  2   ]    e   i  S   [  Œ®  ]     D   [  Œ®  ]             bra    subscript  g  1    subscript  œï  1      subscript  g  2     subscript  œï  2        normal-Œ®    subscript  g  1    subscript  œï  1     normal-¬Ø  normal-Œ®     subscript  g  2    subscript  œï  2     superscript  e    i  S   delimited-[]  normal-Œ®     D   delimited-[]  normal-Œ®        =\int\Psi[g_{1},\phi_{1}]\overline{\Psi}[g_{2},%
 \phi_{2}]e^{iS[\Psi]}D[\Psi]     where S is some functional integral on   Œ®   normal-Œ®   \Psi   with respect to g and   œï   œï   \phi   . Since we know from string theory that membranes by themselves cannot form a physical theory (without supersymmetry etc.) we can be sure the wheeler-de-witt equation in this form is not complete. Since the whole Universe is thought to lie on a 3-brane the functional   Œ®   normal-Œ®   \Psi   is both the field of a 3-brane and the field of the Universe as in WDW. In string theory gravitons come from open strings or membranes wrapped in loops of compactified dimensions.  Mathematical formalism  The Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation 5 is a functional differential equation. It is ill defined in the general case, but very important in theoretical physics , especially in quantum gravity . It is a functional differential equation on the space of three dimensional spatial metrics. The Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation has the form of an operator acting on a wave functional, the functional reduces to a function in cosmology. Contrary to the general case, the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation is well defined in mini-superspaces like the configuration space of cosmological theories. An example of such a wave function is the Hartle‚ÄìHawking state . Bryce DeWitt first published this equation in 1967 under the name "Einstein‚ÄìSchr√∂dinger equation"; it was later renamed the " Wheeler ‚ÄìDeWitt equation". 6  Simply speaking, the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation says  where     H  ^    (  x  )        normal-^  H   x    \hat{H}(x)   is the Hamiltonian constraint in quantized general relativity and    |  œà  ‚ü©     ket  œà    |\psi\rangle   stands for the wave function of the universe . Unlike ordinary quantum field theory or quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian is a first class constraint on physical states. We also have an independent constraint for each point in space.  Although the symbols    H  ^     normal-^  H    \hat{H}   and    |  œà  ‚ü©     ket  œà    |\psi\rangle   may appear familiar, their interpretation in the Wheeler‚ÄìDeWitt equation is substantially different from non-relativistic quantum mechanics.    |  œà  ‚ü©     ket  œà    |\psi\rangle   is no longer a spatial wave function in the traditional sense of a complex-valued function that is defined on a 3-dimensional space-like surface and normalized to unity. Instead it is a functional of field configurations on all of spacetime. This wave function contains all of the information about the geometry and matter content of the universe.    H  ^     normal-^  H    \hat{H}   is still an operator that acts on the Hilbert space of wave functions, but it is not the same Hilbert space as in the nonrelativistic case, and the Hamiltonian no longer determines evolution of the system, so the Schr√∂dinger equation       H  ^    |  œà  ‚ü©    =     i  ‚Ñè  ‚àÇ   /   ‚àÇ  t     |  œà  ‚ü©           normal-^  H    ket  œà          i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi      t     ket  œà      \hat{H}|\psi\rangle=i\hbar\partial/\partial t|\psi\rangle   no longer applies. This property is known as timelessness. The reemergence of time requires the tools of decoherence and clock operators (or the use of a scalar field ).  We also need to augment the Hamiltonian constraint with momentum constraints        ùí´  ‚Üí    (  x  )    |  œà  ‚ü©    =  0         normal-‚Üí  ùí´   x   ket  œà    0    \vec{\mathcal{P}}(x)\left|\psi\right\rangle=0   associated with spatial diffeomorphism invariance.  In minisuperspace approximations, we only have one Hamiltonian constraint (instead of infinitely many of them).  In fact, the principle of general covariance in general relativity implies that global evolution per se does not exist; the time   t   t   t   is just a label we assign to one of the coordinate axes. Thus, what we think about as time evolution of any physical system is just a gauge transformation , similar to that of QED induced by U(1) local gauge transformation    œà  ‚Üí    e   i  Œ∏   (   r  ‚Üí   )     œà      normal-‚Üí  œà     superscript  e    i  Œ∏   normal-‚Üí  r     œà     \psi\rightarrow e^{i\theta(\vec{r})}\psi   where    Œ∏   (   r  ‚Üí   )       Œ∏   normal-‚Üí  r     \theta(\vec{r})   plays the role of local time. The role of a Hamiltonian is simply to restrict the space of the "kinematic" states of the Universe to that of "physical" states - the ones that follow gauge orbits. For this reason we call it a "Hamiltonian constraint." Upon quantization, physical states become wave functions that lie in the kernel of the Hamiltonian operator.  In general, the Hamiltonian vanishes for a theory with general covariance or time-scaling invariance.
