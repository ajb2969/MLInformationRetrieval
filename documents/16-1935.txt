Michel Lazard

Michel Lazard (1924â€“1985) was a French mathematician who worked in the theory of Lie groups in the context of p-adic analysis. His work took on a life of its own in the hands of Daniel Quillen in the late 20th century. Quillen's discovery, that a ring Lazard used to classify formal group laws was isomorphic to an important ring in topology, lead to the subject of chromatic homotopy theory.
Lazard's self contained treatise on one-dimensional formal groups also birthed the field of p-divisible groups.
His major contributions:

classification of p-adic Lie groups: every p-adic Lie group is a closed subgroup of 
 
 

the classification of (1-dimensional commutative) formal groups
the universal formal group law coefficient ring (Lazard's universal ring) is a polynomial ring
the concept of analyseurs, reinvented by Peter May under the name "operads."
