Vector optimization

Vector optimization is a subarea of mathematical optimization where optimization problems with a vector-valued objective functions are optimized with respect to a given partial ordering and subject to certain constraints. A multi-objective optimization problem is a special case of a vector optimization problem: The objective space is the finite dimensional Euclidean space partially ordered by the component-wise "less than or equal to" ordering.
Problem formulation
In mathematical terms, a vector optimization problem can be written as:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  for a partially ordered vector space

 
 . The partial ordering is induced by a cone 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary set and 
 
 
 
  is called the feasible set.
Solution concepts
There are different minimality notions, among them:



 
  is a weakly efficient point (weak minimizer) if for every 
 
 
 
  one has 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is an efficient point (minimizer) if for every 
 
 
 
  one has 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is a properly efficient point (proper minimizer) if 
 
 
 
  is a weakly efficient point with respect to a closed pointed convex cone

 
  where 
 
 
 
 .

Every proper minimizer is a minimizer. And every minimizer is a weak minimizer.1
Modern solution concepts not only consists of minimality notions but also take into account infimum attainment.2

Relation to multi-objective optimization
Any multi-objective optimization problem can be written as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the non-negative orthant of 
 
 
 
 . Thus the minimizer of this vector optimization problem are the Pareto efficient points.
