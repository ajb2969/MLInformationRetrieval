   Vector optimization      Vector optimization   Vector optimization is a subarea of mathematical optimization where optimization problems with a vector-valued objective functions are optimized with respect to a given partial ordering and subject to certain constraints. A multi-objective optimization problem is a special case of a vector optimization problem: The objective space is the finite dimensional Euclidean space partially ordered by the component-wise "less than or equal to" ordering.  Problem formulation  In mathematical terms, a vector optimization problem can be written as:      C    -   min   x  ∈  S     f    (  x  )       C      subscript     x  S     f   x    C\operatorname{-}\min_{x\in S}f(x)   where    f  :   X  →  Z      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Z     f:X\to Z   for a partially ordered vector space    Z   Z   Z   . The partial ordering is induced by a cone    C  ⊆  Z      C  Z    C\subseteq Z   .   X   X   X   is an arbitrary set and    S  ⊆  X      S  X    S\subseteq X   is called the feasible set.  Solution concepts  There are different minimality notions, among them:        x  ¯   ∈  S       normal-¯  x   S    \bar{x}\in S   is a weakly efficient point (weak minimizer) if for every    x  ∈  S      x  S    x\in S   one has      f   (  x  )    -   f   (   x  ¯   )     ∉   -   int  C            f  x     f   normal-¯  x        int  C      f(x)-f(\bar{x})\not\in-\operatorname{int}C   .       x  ¯   ∈  S       normal-¯  x   S    \bar{x}\in S   is an efficient point (minimizer) if for every    x  ∈  S      x  S    x\in S   one has      f   (  x  )    -   f   (   x  ¯   )     ∉   -   C  \   {  0  }             f  x     f   normal-¯  x        normal-\  C   0       f(x)-f(\bar{x})\not\in-C\backslash\{0\}   .       x  ¯   ∈  S       normal-¯  x   S    \bar{x}\in S   is a properly efficient point (proper minimizer) if    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   is a weakly efficient point with respect to a closed  pointed convex cone     C  ~     normal-~  C    \tilde{C}   where     C  \   {  0  }    ⊆   int   C  ~         normal-\  C   0     int   normal-~  C      C\backslash\{0\}\subseteq\operatorname{int}\tilde{C}   .   Every proper minimizer is a minimizer. And every minimizer is a weak minimizer. 1  Modern solution concepts not only consists of minimality notions but also take into account infimum attainment. 2  Solution methods   Benson's algorithm for linear vector optimization problems 3   Relation to multi-objective optimization  Any multi-objective optimization problem can be written as       ℝ  +  d     -   min   x  ∈  M     f    (  x  )        subscript   superscript  ℝ  d         subscript     x  M     f   x    \mathbb{R}^{d}_{+}\operatorname{-}\min_{x\in M}f(x)   where    f  :   X  →   ℝ  d       normal-:  f   normal-→  X   superscript  ℝ  d      f:X\to\mathbb{R}^{d}   and    ℝ  +  d     subscript   superscript  ℝ  d      \mathbb{R}^{d}_{+}   is the non-negative orthant of    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   . Thus the minimizer of this vector optimization problem are the Pareto efficient points.  References  "  Category:Mathematical optimization     ↩  ↩  ↩
