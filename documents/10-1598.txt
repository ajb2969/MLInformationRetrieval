   2-methyleneglutarate mutase      2-methyleneglutarate mutase   In enzymology , a 2-methyleneglutarate mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-methyleneglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-methylene-3-methylsuccinate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-methyleneglutarate , and one product , 2-methylene-3-methylsuccinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-methyleneglutarate carboxy-methylenemethylmutase . This enzyme is also called alpha-methyleneglutarate mutase . This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism . It employs one cofactor , cobamide .
