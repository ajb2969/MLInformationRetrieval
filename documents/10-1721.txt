   Adenosylmethionine hydrolase      Adenosylmethionine hydrolase   In enzymology , an adenosylmethionine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-homoserine + methylthioadenosine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl-L-methionine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are L-homoserine and methylthioadenosine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on ether bonds involving sulfur (thioether and trialkylsulfonium hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine hydrolase . Other names in common use include S-adenosylmethionine cleaving enzyme , methylmethionine-sulfonium-salt hydrolase , and adenosylmethionine lyase .
