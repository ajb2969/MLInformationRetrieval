   Catalan pseudoprime      Catalan pseudoprime   In mathematics, a Catalan pseudoprime is an odd composite number  n satisfying the congruence          (   -  1   )     n  -  1   2    ⋅   C    n  -  1   2     ≡   2     (   mod  n   )     ,       normal-⋅   superscript    1       n  1   2     subscript  C      n  1   2      annotated  2   pmod  n      (-1)^{\frac{n-1}{2}}\cdot C_{\frac{n-1}{2}}\equiv 2\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n),     where C m denotes the m -th Catalan number . The congruence also holds for every odd prime number  n that justifies the name pseudoprimes for composite numbers n satisfying it.  Properties  The only known Catalan pseudoprimes are: 5907, 1194649, and 12327121  with the latter two being squares of Wieferich primes . In general, if p is a Wieferich prime, then p 2 is a Catalan pseudoprime.  References    Catalan pseudoprimes . Research in Scientific Computing in Undergraduate Education.
