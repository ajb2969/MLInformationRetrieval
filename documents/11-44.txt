Anthranilate—CoA ligase




Anthranilate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, an anthranilate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + anthranilate + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + anthranilyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, anthranilate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and anthranilyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is anthranilate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include anthraniloyl coenzyme A synthetase, 2-aminobenzoate-CoA ligase, 2-aminobenzoate-coenzyme A ligase, and 2-aminobenzoate coenzyme A ligase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: carbazole degradation, benzoate degradation via coa ligation, and acridone alkaloid biosynthesis.
