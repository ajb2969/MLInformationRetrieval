Closeness (mathematics)

Closeness is a basic concept in topology and related areas in mathematics. Intuitively we say two sets are close if they are arbitrarily near to each other. The concept can be defined naturally in a metric space where a notion of distance between elements of the space is defined, but it can be generalized to topological spaces where we have no concrete way to measure distances.
Note the difference between closeness, which describes the relation between two sets, and closedness, which describes a single set.
The closure operator closes a given set by mapping it to a closed set which contains the original set and all points close to it. The concept of closeness is related to limit point.
Definition
Given a metric space

 
  a point 
 
 
 
  is called close or near to a set 
 
 
 
  if


 
 , where the distance between a point and a set is defined as


 
 . Similarly a set 
 
 
 
  is called close to a set 
 
 
 
  if


 
  where


 
 .
Properties

if a point 
 
 
 
  is close to a set 
 
 
 
  and a set 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close (the converse is not true!).
closeness between a point and a set is preserved by continuous functions
closeness between two sets is preserved by uniformly continuous functions

Closeness relation between a point and a set
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two sets and 
 
 
 
  a point.

if 
 
 
 
  is close to 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 

if 
 
 
 
  is close to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is close to 
 
 

if 
 
 
 
  is close to 
 
 
 
  then either 
 
 
 
  is close to 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is close to 
 
 


Closeness relation between two sets
Let 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be sets.

if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close
if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close
if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close then either 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close or 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close
if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close

Generalized definition
The closeness relation between a set and a point can be generalized to any topological space. Given a topological space and a point 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is called close to a set 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 .
To define a closeness relation between two sets the topological structure is too weak and we have to use a uniform structure. Given a uniform space, sets A and B are called close to each other if they intersect all entourages, that is, for any entourage U, (A×B)∩U is non-empty.
