   Closeness (mathematics)      Closeness (mathematics)   Closeness is a basic concept in topology and related areas in mathematics . Intuitively we say two sets are close if they are arbitrarily near to each other. The concept can be defined naturally in a metric space where a notion of distance between elements of the space is defined, but it can be generalized to topological spaces where we have no concrete way to measure distances.  Note the difference between closeness , which describes the relation between two sets, and closedness , which describes a single set.  The closure operator  closes a given set by mapping it to a closed set which contains the original set and all points close to it. The concept of closeness is related to limit point .  Definition  Given a metric space     (  X  ,  d  )     X  d    (X,d)   a point   p   p   p   is called close or near to a set   A   A   A   if       d   (  p  ,  A  )    =  0        d   p  A    0    d(p,A)=0   , where the distance between a point and a set is defined as       d   (  p  ,  A  )    :=    inf   a  ∈  A     d   (  p  ,  a  )        assign    d   p  A      subscript  infimum    a  A      d   p  a       d(p,A):=\inf_{a\in A}d(p,a)   . Similarly a set   B   B   B   is called close to a set   A   A   A   if       d   (  B  ,  A  )    =  0        d   B  A    0    d(B,A)=0   where       d   (  B  ,  A  )    :=    inf   b  ∈  B     d   (  b  ,  A  )        assign    d   B  A      subscript  infimum    b  B      d   b  A       d(B,A):=\inf_{b\in B}d(b,A)   .  Properties   if a point   p   p   p   is close to a set   A   A   A   and a set   B   B   B   then   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are close (the converse is not true!).  closeness between a point and a set is preserved by continuous functions  closeness between two sets is preserved by uniformly continuous functions   Closeness relation between a point and a set  Let   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   be two sets and   p   p   p   a point.   if   p   p   p   is close to   A   A   A   then    A  ≠  ∅      A     A\neq\emptyset     if   p   p   p   is close to   A   A   A   and    B  ⊃  A      A  B    B\supset A   then   p   p   p   is close to   B   B   B     if   p   p   p   is close to    A  ∪  B      A  B    A\cup B   then either   p   p   p   is close to   A   A   A   or   p   p   p   is close to   B   B   B      Closeness relation between two sets  Let   A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   and   C   C   C   be sets.   if   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are close then    A  ≠  ∅      A     A\neq\emptyset   and    B  ≠  ∅      B     B\neq\emptyset     if   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are close then   B   B   B   and   A   A   A   are close  if   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are close and    B  ⊂  C      B  C    B\subset C   then   A   A   A   and   C   C   C   are close  if   A   A   A   and    B  ∪  C      B  C    B\cup C   are close then either   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are close or   A   A   A   and   C   C   C   are close  if     A  ∩  B   ≠  ∅        A  B      A\cap B\neq\emptyset   then   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are close   Generalized definition  The closeness relation between a set and a point can be generalized to any topological space. Given a topological space and a point   p   p   p   ,   p   p   p   is called close to a set   A   A   A   if    p  ∈   cl   (  A  )    =   A  ¯         p   cl  A         normal-¯  A      p\in\operatorname{cl}(A)=\overline{A}   .  To define a closeness relation between two sets the topological structure is too weak and we have to use a uniform structure . Given a uniform space , sets A and B are called close to each other if they intersect all entourages , that is, for any entourage U , ( A × B )∩ U is non-empty.
