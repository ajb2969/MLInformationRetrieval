   Alkylhalidase      Alkylhalidase   In enzymology , an alkylhalidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   bromochloromethane + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formaldehyde + bromide + chloride   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are bromochloromethane and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are formaldehyde , bromide , and chloride .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on halide bonds in carbon-halide compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alkyl-halide halidohydrolase . Other names in common use include halogenase , haloalkane halidohydrolase , and haloalkane dehalogenase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.8.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
