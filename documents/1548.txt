Louis Jean-Baptiste Alphonse Bachelier (March 11, 1870 – April 28, 1946) 1 was a French  mathematician at the turn of the 20th century. He is credited with being the first person to model the stochastic process now called Brownian motion , which was part of his PhD thesis The Theory of Speculation , (published 1900).  His thesis, which discussed the use of Brownian motion to evaluate stock options , is historically the first paper to use advanced mathematics in the study of finance . Thus, Bachelier is considered a pioneer in the study of financial mathematics and stochastic processes.  Early years  Bachelier was born in Le Havre . His father was a wine merchant and amateur  scientist , and the vice-consul of Venezuela at Le Havre. His mother was the daughter of an important banker (who was also a writer of poetry books). Both of Louis' parents died just after he completed his high school diploma ("baccalauréat" in French), forcing him to take care of his sister and three-year-old brother and to assume the family business, which effectively put his graduate studies on hold. During this time Bachelier gained a practical acquaintance with the financial markets. His studies were further delayed by military service. Bachelier arrived in Paris in 1892 to study at the Sorbonne , where his grades were less than ideal.  The Thesis  Bachelier's thesis was not well received because it attempted to apply mathematics to an unfamiliar area for mathematicians. 2 However, his instructor, Henri Poincaré , is recorded to have given some positive feedback (though socially insufficient for finding an immediate teaching position in France at that time). For example, Poincaré called his approach to deriving Gauss ' law of errors  The thesis received a grade of honorable, and was accepted for publication in the prestigious Annales Scientifiques de l’École Normale Supérieure . While it did not receive a mark of très honorable , despite its ultimate importance, the grade assigned is still interpreted as an appreciation for his contribution. Jean-Michel Courtault et al. point out in "On the Centenary of Theorie de la Speculation " that honorable was "the highest note which could be awarded for a thesis that was essentially outside mathematics and that had a number of arguments far from being rigorous." The positive feedback from Poincaré can be attributed to his interest in mathematical ideas, not just rigorous proof .  Academic career  For several years following the successful defense of his thesis, Bachelier further developed the theory of diffusion processes , and was published in prestigious journals. In 1909 he became a "free professor" at the Sorbonne . In 1914, he published a book, Le Jeu, la Chance, et le Hasard (Games, Chance, and Randomness), that sold over six thousand copies. With the support of the Council of the University of Paris , Bachelier was given a permanent professorship at the Sorbonne, but World War I intervened and Bachelier was drafted into the French army as a private. His army service ended on December 31, 1918. 3 In 1919, he found a position as an assistant professor in Besançon , replacing a regular professor on leave. 4 He married Augustine Jeanne Maillot in September 1920 but was soon widowed. 5 When the professor returned in 1922, Bachelier replaced another professor at Dijon . 6 He moved to Rennes in 1925, but was finally awarded a permanent professorship in 1927 at Besançon, where he worked for 10 years until his retirement. 7  Besides the setback that the war had caused him, Bachelier was blackballed in 1926 when he attempted to receive a permanent position at Dijon. This was due to a "misinterpretation" of one of Bachelier's papers by Professor Paul Lévy , who—to Bachelier's understandable fury—knew nothing of Bachelier's work, nor of the candidate that Lévy recommended above him. Lévy later learned of his error, and reconciled himself with Bachelier. 8  Although Bachelier's work on random walks was more mathematical and predated Einstein 's celebrated study of Brownian motion by five years, Lord Rayleigh 's work on a heavy particle in a single temperature buffer gas 9 predates Bachelier's work by nine years and is among the first descriptions of Brownian motion to describe the relation between the dissipation and fluctuations of a stochastic system, also known as the fluctuation-dissipation theorem .
