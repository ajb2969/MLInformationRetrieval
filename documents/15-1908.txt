Diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase (ATP-forming)

Diadenosine hexaphosphate hydrolase (ATP-forming) (, Ndx1) is an enzyme with system name P1,P6-bis(5'-adenosyl)hexaphosphate nucleotidohydrolase (ATP-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) P1,P6-bis(5'-adenosyl)hexaphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  2 ATP
 
(2) P1,P5-bis(5'-adenosyl)pentaphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  ATP + ADP
 
(3) P1,P4-bis(5'-adenosyl)tetraphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  ATP + AMP
 

The enzyme requires the presence of the divalent cations (Mn2+, Mg2+, Zn2+, and Co2+).
