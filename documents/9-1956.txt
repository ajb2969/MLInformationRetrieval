Hermite constant

In mathematics, the Hermite constant, named after Charles Hermite, determines how short an element of a lattice in Euclidean space can be.
The constant 
 
 
 
  for integers n > 0 is defined as follows. For a lattice L in Euclidean space Rn unit covolume, i.e. vol(Rn/L) = 1, let λ1(L) denote the least length of a nonzero element of L. Then 
 
 
 
  is the maximum of λ1(L) over all such lattices L.
The square root in the definition of the Hermite constant is a matter of historical convention. With the definition as stated, it turns out that the Hermite constant grows linearly in n as n becomes unbounded.
Alternatively, the Hermite constant 
 
 
 
  can be defined as the square of the maximal systole of a flat n-dimensional torus of unit volume.
Example
The Hermite constant is known in dimensions 1–8 and 24. For n = 2, one has 
 
 
 
 . This value is attained by the hexagonal lattice of the Eisenstein integers.1
Estimates
It is known that2



A stronger estimate due to Hans Frederick Blichfeldt3 is4
