   Hermite constant      Hermite constant   In mathematics , the Hermite constant , named after Charles Hermite , determines how short an element of a lattice in Euclidean space can be.  The constant    γ  n     subscript  γ  n    \gamma_{n}   for integers n > 0 is defined as follows. For a lattice L in Euclidean space R n unit covolume, i.e. vol( R n / L ) = 1, let λ 1 ( L ) denote the least length of a nonzero element of L . Then     γ  n        subscript  γ  n     \sqrt{\gamma_{n}}   is the maximum of λ 1 ( L ) over all such lattices L .  The square root in the definition of the Hermite constant is a matter of historical convention. With the definition as stated, it turns out that the Hermite constant grows linearly in n as n becomes unbounded.  Alternatively, the Hermite constant    γ  n     subscript  γ  n    \gamma_{n}   can be defined as the square of the maximal systole of a flat n -dimensional torus of unit volume.  Example  The Hermite constant is known in dimensions 1–8 and 24. For n = 2, one has     γ  2   =   2   3         subscript  γ  2     2    3      \gamma_{2}=\tfrac{2}{\sqrt{3}}   . This value is attained by the hexagonal lattice of the Eisenstein integers . 1  Estimates  It is known that 2        γ  n   ≤    (   4  3   )     (   n  -  1   )   /  2     .       subscript  γ  n    superscript    4  3       n  1   2      \gamma_{n}\leq\left(\frac{4}{3}\right)^{(n-1)/2}.     A stronger estimate due to Hans Frederick Blichfeldt 3 is 4        γ  n   ≤    (   2  π   )   Γ    (   2  +   n  2    )    2  /  n      .       subscript  γ  n       2  π   normal-Γ   superscript    2    n  2      2  n       \gamma_{n}\leq\left(\frac{2}{\pi}\right)\Gamma\left(2+\frac{n}{2}\right)^{2/n}.
