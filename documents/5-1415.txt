   Uniformizable space      Uniformizable space   In mathematics , a topological space  X is uniformizable if there exists a uniform structure on X which induces the topology of X . Equivalently, X is uniformizable if and only if it is homeomorphic to a uniform space (equipped with the topology induced by the uniform structure).  Any ( pseudo ) metrizable space is uniformizable since the (pseudo)metric uniformity induces the (pseudo)metric topology. The converse fails: There are uniformizable spaces which are not (pseudo)metrizable. However, it is true that the topology of a uniformizable space can always be induced by a family of pseudometrics ; indeed, this is because any uniformity on a set X can be defined by a family of pseudometrics.  Showing that a space is uniformizable is much simpler than showing it is metrizable. In fact, uniformizability is equivalent to a common separation axiom :   A topological space is uniformizable if and only if it is completely regular .    Induced uniformity  One way to construct a uniform structure on a topological space X is to take the initial uniformity on X induced by C ( X ), the family of real-valued continuous functions on X . This is the coarsest uniformity on X for which all such functions are uniformly continuous . A subbase for this uniformity is given by the set of all entourages       D   f  ,  ε    =   {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   X  ×  X    :    |    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )     |   <  ε   }        subscript  D   f  ε     conditional-set     x  y     X  X            f  x     f  y     ε      D_{f,\varepsilon}=\{(x,y)\in X\times X:|f(x)-f(y)|<\varepsilon\}   where f ∈ C ( X ) and ε > 0.  The uniform topology generated by the above uniformity is the initial topology induced by the family C ( X ). In general, this topology will be coarser than the given topology on X . The two topologies will coincide if and only if X is completely regular.  Fine uniformity  Given a uniformizable space X there is a finest uniformity on X compatible with the topology of X called the fine uniformity or universal uniformity . A uniform space is said to be fine if it has the fine uniformity generated by its uniform topology.  The fine uniformity is characterized by the universal property : any continuous function f from a fine space X to a uniform space Y is uniformly continuous. This implies that the functor  F : CReg → Uni which assigns to any completely regular space X the fine uniformity on X is left adjoint to the forgetful functor which sends a uniform space to its underlying completely regular space.  Explicitly, the fine uniformity on a completely regular space X is generated by all open neighborhoods D of the diagonal in X × X (with the product topology ) such that there exists a sequence D 1 , D 2 , … of open neighborhoods of the diagonal with D = D 1 and      D  n   ∘   D  n    ⊂   D   n  -  1           subscript  D  n    subscript  D  n     subscript  D    n  1      D_{n}\circ D_{n}\subset D_{n-1}   .  The uniformity on a completely regular space X induced by C ( X ) (see the previous section) is not always the fine uniformity.
