Shimura correspondence

In number theory, the Shimura correspondence is a correspondence between modular forms F of half integral weight k+1/2, and modular forms f of even weight 2k, discovered by . It has the property that the eigenvalue of a Hecke operator Tn2 on F is equal to the eigenvalue of Tn on f.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a holomorphic cusp form with weight 
 
 
 
  and character 
 
 
 
  . For any prime number p, let



where 
 
 
 
 's are the eigenvalues of the Hecke operators

 
  determined by p.
Using the functional equation of L-function, Shimura showed that



is a holomorphic modular function with weight 2k and character
