   Cysteine synthase      Cysteine synthase   In enzymology , a cysteine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   O 3 -acetyl-L-serine + hydrogen sulfide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-cysteine + acetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are O3-acetyl-L-serine and hydrogen sulfide , whereas its two products are L-cysteine and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is O3-acetyl-L-serine:hydrogen-sulfide 2-amino-2-carboxyethyltransferase . Other names in common use include O-acetyl-L-serine sulfhydrylase , O-acetyl-L-serine sulfohydrolase , O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase , O-acetylserine (thiol)-lyase A , O-acetylserine sulfhydrylase , O3-acetyl-L-serine acetate-lyase (adding hydrogen-sulfide) , acetylserine sulfhydrylase , cysteine synthetase , S-sulfocysteine synthase , 3-O-acetyl-L-serine:hydrogen-sulfide , and 2-amino-2-carboxyethyltransferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : cysteine metabolism , selenoamino acid metabolism , and sulfur metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
