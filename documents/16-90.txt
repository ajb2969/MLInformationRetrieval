(-)-alpha-cuprenene synthase

(-)-alpha-cuprenene synthase (, Cop6) is an enzyme with system name (-)-alpha-cuprenene hydrolase (cyclizing, (-)-alpha-cuprenene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (-)-alpha-cuprenene + diphosphate


The enzyme from the fungus Coprinopsis cinerea produces (-)-alpha-cuprenene with high selectivity.
