   Preferential entailment      Preferential entailment   Preferential entailment is a non-monotonic logic based on selecting only models that are considered the most plausible. The plausibility of models is expressed by an ordering among models called a preference relation, hence the name preference entailment.  Formally, given a propositional formula    F   F   F   and an ordering over propositional models   ≤     \leq   , preferential entailment selects only the models of   F   F   F   that are minimal according to   ≤     \leq   . This selection leads to a non-monotonic inference relation    F   ⊧  pref   G      subscript  models  pref   F  G    F\models_{\text{pref}}G   holds if and only if all minimal models of   F   F   F   according to   ≤     \leq   are also models of   G   G   G   . 1  Circumscription can be seen as the particular case of preferential entailment when the ordering is based on containment of the sets of variables assigned to true (in the propositional case) or containment of the extensions of predicates (in the first-order logic case). 2  See also   Rational consequence relation   References  "  Category:Logic in computer science  Category:Knowledge representation  Category:Non-classical logic     . ↩
