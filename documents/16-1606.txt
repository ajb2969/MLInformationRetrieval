   Bifilar sundial      Bifilar sundial   (Figure)  A bifilar dial showing the two wires   This type of sundial was discovered by the German mathematician Hugo Michnik in 1922. The bifilar sundial has two non-touching threads parallel to the dial. Usually the second thread is orthogonal -(perpendicular) to the first.  The intersection of the two threads' shadows gives the local apparent time .  When the threads have the correctly calculated separation, the hour-lines on the horizontal surface are uniformly drawn. The angle between successive hour-lines is constant. The hour-lines for successive hours are 15 degrees apart.  History  The original discovery was made and published in April 1922 by the mathematician and maths teacher, Hugo Michnik, from Beuthen , Upper Silesia . He studied the horizontal dial- starting on a conventional XYZ cartesian framework and building up a general projection which he states was an exceptional case of a Steiner transformation . He related the trace of the sun to conic sections and the angle on the dial-plate to the hour angle and the calculation of local apparent time , using conventional hours and the historic Italian and Babylonian hours .  He refers in the paper, to a previous publication on the theory of sundials in 1914. 1  His method has been applied to vertical near-declinant dials, and a more general declining-reclining dial.  Work has been subsequently done by Dominique Collin.  Horizontal bifilar dial  This was the dial that Hugo Michnik discovered and studied. By simplifying the general example so:  :* the wires cross orthogonally - one running north-south and the other east-west  :* The east west wire passes under the north south dial, so the      h  2   =    h  1    sin  œÜ          subscript  h  2      subscript  h  1     œÜ      h_{2}=h_{1}\sin\varphi\quad   (latitude) the shadow is thrown on a dial-plate marked out like a simple equatorial sundial .  The proof  The first wire     f  1      subscript  f  1    f_{1}\,   is orientated north-south at a constant distance     h  1      subscript  h  1    h_{1}\,   from the dial plate    Œ†    normal-Œ†   \Pi\,    The second wire     f  2      subscript  f  2    f_{2}\,   is orientated east-west at a constant distance     h  2      subscript  h  2    h_{2}\,   from the dial plate    Œ†    normal-Œ†   \Pi\,   (thus     f  2      subscript  f  2    f_{2}\,   is orthogonal to     f  1      subscript  f  1    f_{1}\,   which lies on the plane of the meridian ).  In this proof   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   (pronounced phi) is the latitude of the dial plate.  Respectively,    (   ùíü  1   )     subscript  ùíü  1    (\mathcal{D}_{1})   and    (   ùíü  2   )     subscript  ùíü  2    (\mathcal{D}_{2})   are the vertical projections of wires     f  1      subscript  f  1    f_{1}\,   and     f  2      subscript  f  2    f_{2}\,   on the dial plate    Œ†    normal-Œ†   \Pi\,   .  Point    O    O   O\,   is the point on the dial plate directly under the two wires' intersection. That point is the origin of the X,Y co-ordinate system referred to below.  The X-axis is the east-west line passing through the origin. The Y-axis is the north-south line passing through the origin. The positive Y direction is northward.  One can show that if the position of the sun is known and determined by the spherical coordinates     t  ‚äô     subscript  t  direct-product    t_{\odot}   et    Œ¥    Œ¥   \delta\,   (pronounced t-dot and delta, respectively the known as the hour angle et declination ), the co-ordinates     x  I      subscript  x  I    x_{I}\,   and     y  I      subscript  y  I    y_{I}\,   of point    I    I   I\,   , the intersection on the two shadows on the dial-plate    Œ†    normal-Œ†   \Pi\,   have values of :         x  I     =      h  1      sin   t  ‚äô       sin   œÜ     tan   Œ¥     +    cos  œÜ    cos   t  ‚äô                         y  I     =      h  2       -    cos   œÜ     tan   Œ¥      +    sin  œÜ    cos   t  ‚äô         sin   œÜ     tan   Œ¥     +    cos  œÜ    cos   t  ‚äô                subscript  x  I       subscript  h  1        subscript  t  direct-product          œÜ    tan  Œ¥        œÜ      subscript  t  direct-product          absent  absent  absent     subscript  y  I       subscript  h  2             œÜ    tan  Œ¥         œÜ      subscript  t  direct-product            œÜ    tan  Œ¥        œÜ      subscript  t  direct-product           \begin{matrix}x_{I}&=&h_{1}\frac{\sin t_{\odot}}{\sin\varphi\ \operatorname{%
 tan}\delta\ +\ \cos\varphi\cos t_{\odot}}\\
 &&\\
 y_{I}&=&h_{2}\frac{-\cos\varphi\ \operatorname{tan}\delta\ +\ \sin\varphi\cos t%
 _{\odot}}{\sin\varphi\ \operatorname{tan}\delta\ +\ \cos\varphi\cos t_{\odot}}%
 \end{matrix}     Eliminating the variable    Œ¥    Œ¥   \delta\,   in the two preceding equations, one obtains a new equation defined for     x  I      subscript  x  I    x_{I}\,   and     y  I      subscript  y  I    y_{I}\,   which gives, as a function of the latitude   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   and the solar hour angle solaire    t  ‚äô     subscript  t  direct-product    t_{\odot}   , the equation of the trace of the sun associated with the local apparent time. In its simplest form this equation is written:        x  I     y  I   +    h  2   /   tan  œÜ      =       h  1    sin  œÜ     h  2      tan   t  ‚äô            subscript  x  I      subscript  y  I      subscript  h  2    tan  œÜ             subscript  h  1     œÜ     subscript  h  2     tan   subscript  t  direct-product       \frac{x_{I}}{y_{I}+h_{2}/\operatorname{tan}\varphi}=\frac{h_{1}\sin\varphi}{h_%
 {2}}\ \operatorname{tan}t_{\odot}   This relation shows that the hour traces are indeed line segments and the meeting-point of these line segments is the point    C    C   C\,   :   x_C = 0\,     y_C = -h_2 / \operatorname{tan}\varphi    In other words, point C is south of point O (where the wires intersect), by a distance of h_2 / \operatorname{tan}\varphi , where   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   is the latitude.   Special case   If one arranges the two wire heights     h  2      subscript  h  2    h_{2}\,   and     h  1      subscript  h  1    h_{1}\,   such :     h_2 = h_1 \sin\varphi\quad    then the equation for the hour lines can be simply written as:         x  I   -   x  C      y  I   -   y  C     =   tan   t  ‚äô             subscript  x  I    subscript  x  C       subscript  y  I    subscript  y  C      tan   subscript  t  direct-product      \frac{x_{I}-x_{C}}{y_{I}-y_{C}}=\operatorname{tan}t_{\odot}   at all times, the intersection    I    I   I\,   of the shadows on the dial plate    Œ†    normal-Œ†   \Pi\,   is such that the angle     O  C  I   ^     normal-^    O  C  I     \widehat{OCI}   is equal to the hour angle     t  ‚äô     subscript  t  direct-product    t_{\odot}   of the sun so thus represents solar time.  So provided the sundial respects the la condition      h  2   =    h  1    sin  œÜ          subscript  h  2      subscript  h  1     œÜ      h_{2}=h_{1}\sin\varphi\quad   the trace of the sun corresponds to the hour-angle shown by lines (rays) centred on the point    C    C   C\,   and the 13 rays that correspond to the hours 6:00, 7:00, 8:00, 9:00... 15:00, 16:00, 17:00, 18:00 are regularly spaced at a constant angle of 15¬∞, about point C.  A practical example  A London dial is the name given to dials set for 51¬∞ 30' N. A simple London bifilar dial has a dial plate with 13 line segments drawn outward from a centre-point C, with each hour's line drawn 15¬∞ clockwise from the previous hour's line. The midday line is aligned towards the north.  The north-south wire is 10 cm (    h  1     subscript  h  1    h_{1}   ) above the midday line. That east-west wire is placed at a height of 7.826 (    h  2     subscript  h  2    h_{2}   ) centimeters- equivalent to 10cm x sin(51¬∞ 30'). This passes through C. The east-west wire crosses the north-south wire 6.275 cm north of the centre-point C- that being the equivalent of - 7.826 (    h  2     subscript  h  2    h_{2}   ) divided by tan (51¬∞ 30').  Reclining-declining bifilar sundials  Whether a sundial is a bifilar, or whether it's the familiar flat-dial with a straight style (like the usual horizontal and vertical-declining sundials), making it reclining, vertical-declining, or reclining-declining is exactly the same. The declining or reclining-declining mounting is achieved in exactly the same manner, whether the dial is bifilar, or the usual straight-style flat dial.  For any flat-dial, whether bifilar, or ordinary straight-style, the north celestial pole has a certain altitude, measured from the plane of the dial.   Effective latitude :If that dial-plane is horizontal, then it's a horizontal dial (bifilar, or straight-style). Then, of course the north celestial pole's altitude, measured from the dial-plane, is the latitude of the location. Well then, if the flat-dial is reclined, declined, or reclined-&-declined, everything is the same as if it the dial were horizontal, with the celestial pole's altitude, measured with respect to the dial-plane, treated as the latitude.  Dial-North :Likewise, the north celestial pole's longitude, measured with respect to the plane of the dial, with respect to the downward direction (or the direction that a marble would roll, if the dial is reclining)on the dial-face, is the direction that is treated as north, when drawing the hour-lines. I'll call that direction "dial-north".  Equatorial Longitude (hour-angle) of dial-north :It's necessary to find the equatorial longitude of the dial-north direction (drawn on the dial). In the case of the horizontal dial, of course that's an hour-angle of zero, the south meridian. That determines what time ("dial-north time") is represented by the dial-north line. Other times, before and after that, can then have their lines drawn according to their differences from dial-north time--in the same way as they' be drawn on a horizontal dial-face according to their differences from 12 noon (true solar time).
