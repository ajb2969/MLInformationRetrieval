Grunsky's theorem

In mathematics, Grunsky's theorem, due to the German mathematician Helmut Grunsky, is a result in complex analysis concerning holomorphic univalent functions defined on the unit disk in the complex numbers. The theorem states that a univalent function defined on the unit disc, fixing the point 0, maps every disk |z| \left|\log {zf^\prime(z)\over f(z)}\right|\le \log {1+|z|\over 1-|z|}.
Taking the real and imaginary parts of the logarithm, this implies the two inequalities



and



For fixed z, both these equalities are attained by suitable Koebe functions



where |w| = 1.
Proof of inequality
originally proved these inequalities based on extremal techniques of Ludwig Bieberbach. Subsequent proofs, outlined in , relied on the Loewner equation. More elementary proofs were subsequently given based on Goluzin's inequalities, an equivalent form of Grunsky's inequalities (1939) for the Grunsky matrix.
For a univalent function g in z > 1 with an expansion



Goluzin's inequalities state that



where the zi are distinct points with |zi| > 1 and λi are arbitrary complex numbers.
Taking n = 2. with λ1 = – λ2 = λ, the inequality implies



If g is an odd function and η = – ζ, this yields



Finally if f is any normalized univalent function in D, the required inequality for f follows by taking



with 
 
 

Proof of theorem
Let f be a univalent function on D with f(0) = 0. By Nevanlinna's criterion, f is starlike on |z|  \Re {zf^\prime(z)\over f(z)} \ge 0
for |z| \left|\arg {zf^\prime(z)\over f(z)}\right| \le {\pi\over 2}.
On the other hand by the inequality of Grunsky above,



Thus if



the inequality holds at z. This condition is equivalent to



and hence f is starlike on any disk |z|
