3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-decarboxylase

In enzymology, a 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 
 
 
 
  3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate, and two products, 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-carboxy-lyase (3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate-forming). This enzyme is also called 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in vitamin B6 metabolism.
