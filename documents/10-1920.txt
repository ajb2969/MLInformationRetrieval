   3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-decarboxylase      3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-decarboxylase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate , and two products , 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-carboxy-lyase (3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-5-carboxylate-forming) . This enzyme is also called 3-hydroxy-2-methylpyridine-4,5-dicarboxylate 4-carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism .
