Ribbon Hopf algebra

A ribbon Hopf algebra

 
  is a quasitriangular Hopf algebra which possess an invertible central element 
 
 
 
  more commonly known as the ribbon element, such that the following conditions hold:






where 
 
 
 
 . Note that the element u exists for any quasitriangular Hopf algebra, and 
 
 
 
  must always be central and satisfies 
 
 
 
 , so that all that is required is that it have a central square root with the above properties.
