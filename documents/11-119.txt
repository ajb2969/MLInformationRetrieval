Propionate—CoA ligase




Propionate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, a propionate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + propanoate + CoA 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + propanoyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, propanoate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and propanoyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is propanoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). This enzyme is also called propionyl-CoA synthetase. This enzyme participates in propanoate metabolism.
