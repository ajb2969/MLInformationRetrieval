   Brauer's three main theorems      Brauer's three main theorems   Brauer's main theorems are three theorems in representation theory of finite groups linking the blocks of a finite group (in characteristic p ) with those of its p -local subgroups , that is to say, the normalizers of its non-trivial p -subgroups.  The second and third main theorems allow refinements of orthogonality relations for ordinary characters which may be applied in finite group theory . These do not presently admit a proof purely in terms of ordinary characters. All three main theorems are stated in terms of the Brauer correspondence .  Brauer correspondence  There are many ways to extend the definition which follows, but this is close to the early treatments by Brauer. Let G be a finite group, p be a prime, F be a field of characteristic p . Let H be a subgroup of G which contains      Q   C  G    (  Q  )       Q   subscript  C  G   Q    QC_{G}(Q)     for some p -subgroup Q of G, and is contained in the normalizer       N  G    (  Q  )        subscript  N  G   Q    N_{G}(Q)   ,  where     C  G    (  Q  )        subscript  C  G   Q    C_{G}(Q)   is the centralizer of Q in G .  The Brauer homomorphism (with respect to H ) is a linear map from the center of the group algebra of G over F to the corresponding algebra for H . Specifically, it is the restriction to    Z   (   F  G   )       Z    F  G     Z(FG)   of the (linear) projection from    F  G      F  G    FG   to    F   C  G    (  Q  )       F   subscript  C  G   Q    FC_{G}(Q)   whose kernel is spanned by the elements of G outside     C  G    (  Q  )        subscript  C  G   Q    C_{G}(Q)   . The image of this map is contained in    Z   (   F  H   )       Z    F  H     Z(FH)   , and it transpires that the map is also a ring homomorphism.  Since it is a ring homomorphism , for any block B of FG , the Brauer homomorphism sends the identity element of B either to 0 or to an idempotent element. In the latter case, the idempotent may be decomposed as a sum of (mutually orthogonal) primitive idempotents of Z(FH). Each of these primitive idempotents is the multiplicative identity of some block of FH. The block b of FH is said to be a Brauer correspondent of B if its identity element occurs in this decomposition of the image of the identity of B under the Brauer homomorphism.  Brauer's first main theorem  Brauer's first main theorem  states that if   G   G   G   is a finite group a   D   D   D   is a   p   p   p   -subgroup of   G   G   G   , then there is a bijection between the set of (characteristic p ) blocks of   G   G   G   with defect group   D   D   D   and blocks of the normalizer     N  G    (  D  )        subscript  N  G   D    N_{G}(D)   with defect group D . This bijection arises because when    H  =    N  G    (  D  )        H     subscript  N  G   D     H=N_{G}(D)   , each block of G with defect group D has a unique Brauer correspondent block of H , which also has defect group D .  Brauer's second main theorem  Brauer's second main theorem  gives, for an element t whose order is a power of a prime p , a criterion for a (characteristic p ) block of     C  G    (  t  )        subscript  C  G   t    C_{G}(t)   to correspond to a given block of   G   G   G   , via generalized decomposition numbers . These are the coefficients which occur when the restrictions of ordinary characters of   G   G   G   (from the given block) to elements of the form tu , where u ranges over elements of order prime to p in     C  G    (  t  )        subscript  C  G   t    C_{G}(t)   , are written as linear combinations of the irreducible Brauer characters of     C  G    (  t  )        subscript  C  G   t    C_{G}(t)   . The content of the theorem is that it is only necessary to use Brauer characters from blocks of     C  G    (  t  )        subscript  C  G   t    C_{G}(t)   which are Brauer correspondents of the chosen block of G .  Brauer's third main theorem  Brauer's third main theorem  states that when Q is a p -subgroup of the finite group G , and H is a subgroup of G, containing    Q   C  G    (  Q  )       Q   subscript  C  G   Q    QC_{G}(Q)   , and contained in     N  G    (  Q  )        subscript  N  G   Q    N_{G}(Q)   , then the principal block of H is the only Brauer correspondent of the principal block of G (where the blocks referred to are calculated in characteristic p ).
