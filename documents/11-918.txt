   Glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase      Glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase   In enzymology , a glutaminyl-peptide cyclotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutaminyl-peptide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-oxoprolyl-peptide + NH 3    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-glutaminyl-peptide , and two products , 5-oxoprolyl-peptide and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the aminoacyltransferases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutaminyl-peptide gamma-glutamyltransferase (cyclizing) . Other names in common use include glutaminyl-tRNA cyclotransferase , glutaminyl cyclase , and glutaminyl-transfer ribonucleate cyclotransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
