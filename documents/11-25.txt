   2,3-dihydroxybenzoate—serine ligase      2,3-dihydroxybenzoate—serine ligase   In enzymology , a 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate—serine ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate + L-serine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   products of ATP breakdown + N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-serine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate , and L-serine , whereas its two products are products of ATP breakdown and N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-L-serine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,3-dihydroxybenzoate:L-serine ligase . Other names in common use include N-(2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl)-serine synthetase , and 2,3-dihydroxybenzoylserine synthetase .
