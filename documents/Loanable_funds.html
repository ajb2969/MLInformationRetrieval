<h1>Loanable funds</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="economics" title="wikilink">economics</a>, the <strong>loanable funds doctrine</strong> is a theory of the market interest rate. According to this approach, the interest rate is determined by the demand for and supply of loanable funds. The term <em>loanable funds</em> includes all forms of credit.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>The loanable funds doctrine was formulated in the 1930s by British economist <a href="Dennis_Robertson" title="wikilink">Dennis Robertson</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> and Swedish economist <a href="Bertil_Ohlin" title="wikilink">Bertil Ohlin</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> However, Ohlin attributed its origin to Swedish economist <a href="Knut_Wicksell" title="wikilink">Knut Wicksell</a> and the so-called <em>Stockholm school</em>.</p>
<h2 id="basic-features">Basic Features</h2>

<p>The loanable funds doctrine extends the classical theory, which determined the interest rate solely by savings and investment, in that it adds bank credit. The total amount of credit available in an economy can exceed private savings because the bank system is in a position to create credit out of thin air. Hence, the equilibrium (or market) interest rate is not only influenced by the propensities to save and invest but also by the creation or destruction of fiat money and credit.</p>

<p>If the bank system enhances credit, this will diminish the market interest rate below the <em>natural rate</em>. Wicksell had defined the natural rate as that interest rate which is compatible with a stable price level. Credit creation and credit destruction induce changes in the price level and in the level of economic activity.</p>

<p>According to Ohlin (op. cit., p. 222), one cannot say "that the rate of interest equalises planned savings and planned investment, for it obviously does not do that. How, then, is the height of the interest rate determined. The answer is that the rate of interest is simply the price of credit, and that is is therefore governed by the supply of and demand for credit. The banking system - through its ability to give credit - <em>can</em> influence, and to some extent does affect, the interest level."</p>

<p>In formal terms, the loanable funds doctrine determines the market interest rate through the following equilibrium condition:</p>

<p>During the 1930s, and again during the 1950s, the relationship between the loanable funds doctrine and its main competitor, the Keynesian <a href="Liquidity_preference" title="wikilink">liquidity preference doctrine</a>, were discussed at length. Some authors considered the two approaches as largely equivalent<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> but this issue is still unresolved.</p>
