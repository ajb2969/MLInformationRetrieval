   Connection (principal bundle)      Connection (principal bundle)   In mathematics , a connection is a device that defines a notion of parallel transport on the bundle; that is, a way to "connect" or identify fibers over nearby points. A principal G -connection on a principal G-bundle  P over a smooth manifold  M is a particular type of connection which is compatible with the action of the group G .  A principal connection can be viewed as a special case of the notion of an Ehresmann connection , and is sometimes called a principal Ehresmann connection. It gives rise to (Ehresmann) connections on any fiber bundle associated to P via the associated bundle construction. In particular, on any associated vector bundle the principal connection induces a covariant derivative , an operator that can differentiate sections of that bundle along tangent directions in the base manifold. Principal connections generalize to arbitrary principal bundles the concept of a linear connection on the frame bundle of a smooth manifold .  Formal definition  Let π : P → M be a smooth principal G -bundle over a smooth manifold  M . Then a principal G -connection on P is a differential 1-form on P  with values in the Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   of G which is G-equivariant and reproduces the Lie algebra generators of the fundamental vector fields on P .  In other words, it is an element ω of      Ω  1    (  P  ,  𝔤  )    ≅    C  ∞    (  P  ,     T  *   P   ⊗  𝔤   )           superscript  normal-Ω  1    P  𝔤       superscript  C     P   tensor-product     superscript  T    P   𝔤       \Omega^{1}(P,\mathfrak{g})\cong C^{\infty}(P,T^{*}P\otimes\mathfrak{g})   such that         ad  g    (    R  g  *   ω   )    =  ω         subscript  ad  g      superscript   subscript  R  g     ω    ω    \hbox{ad}_{g}(R_{g}^{*}\omega)=\omega   where R g denotes right multiplication by g , and    ad  g     subscript  ad  g    \operatorname{ad}_{g}   is the adjoint representation on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   (explicitly,     ad  g   X  =   d   d  t    g  exp   (  t  X  )    g   -  1     |   t  =  0       fragments   subscript  ad  g   X     d    d  t    g    fragments  normal-(  t  X  normal-)    superscript  g    1     subscript  normal-|    t  0      \operatorname{ad}_{g}X=\frac{d}{dt}g\exp(tX)g^{-1}\bigl|_{t=0}   );  if    ξ  ∈  𝔤      ξ  𝔤    \xi\in\mathfrak{g}   and X ξ is the vector field on P associated to ξ by differentiating the G action on P , then ω ( X ξ ) = ξ (identically on P ).   Sometimes the term principal G-connection refers to the pair ( P , ω ) and ω itself is called the connection form or connection 1-form of the principal connection.  Relation to Ehresmann connections  A principal G-connection ω on P determines an Ehresmann connection on P in the following way. First note that the fundamental vector fields generating the G action on P provide a bundle isomorphism (covering the identity of P ) from the bundle  VP to    P  ×  𝔤      P  𝔤    P\times\mathfrak{g}   , where VP = ker(d π ) is the kernel of the tangent mapping      d  π   :    T  P   →   T  M       normal-:    normal-d  π    normal-→    T  P     T  M      {\mathrm{d}}\pi\colon TP\to TM   which is called the vertical bundle of P . It follows that ω determines uniquely a bundle map v : TP → V which is the identity on V . Such a projection v is uniquely determined by its kernel, which is a smooth subbundle H of TP (called the horizontal bundle ) such that TP = V ⊕ H . This is an Ehresmann connection.  Conversely, an Ehresmann connection H ⊂ TP (or v : TP → V ) on P defines a principal G -connection ω if and only if it is G -equivariant in the sense that     H   p  g    =   d    (   R  g   )   p    (   H  p   )         subscript  H    p  g      normal-d   subscript   subscript  R  g   p    subscript  H  p      H_{pg}=\mathrm{d}(R_{g})_{p}(H_{p})   .  Form in a local trivialization  A local trivialization of a principal bundle P is given by a section s of P over an open subset U of M . Then the pullback  s * ω of a principal connection is a 1-form on U with values in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . If the section s is replaced by a new section sg , defined by ( sg )( x ) = s ( x ) g ( x ), where g : M → G is a smooth map, then ( sg ) * ω = Ad(g) −1  s * ω + g −1 d g . The principal connection is uniquely determined by this family of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -valued 1-forms, and these 1-forms are also called connection forms or connection 1-forms , particularly in older or more physics-oriented literature.  Bundle of principal connections  The group G acts on the tangent bundle  TP by right translation. The quotient space  TP / G is also a manifold, and inherits the structure of a fibre bundle over TM which shall be denoted dπ : TP / G → TM . Let ρ: TP / G → M be the projection onto M . The fibres of the bundle TP / G under the projection ρ carry an additive structure.  The bundle TP / G is called the bundle of principal connections . A section Γ of dπ: TP / G → TM such that Γ : TM → TP / G is a linear morphism of vector bundles over M , can be identified with a principal connection in P . Conversely, a principal connection as defined above gives rise to such a section Γ of TP / G .  Finally, let Γ be a principal connection in this sense. Let q : TP → TP / G be the quotient map. The horizontal distribution of the connection is the bundle       H  =    q   -  1    Γ   (   T  M   )    ⊂   T  P    .        H     superscript  q    1    normal-Γ    T  M           T  P      H=q^{-1}\Gamma(TM)\subset TP.     Affine property  If ω and ''ω' '' are principal connections on a principal bundle P , then the difference ''ω' ''- ω is a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -valued 1-form on P which is not only G -equivariant, but horizontal in the sense that it vanishes on any section of the vertical bundle V of P . Hence it is basic and so is determined by a 1 -form on M with values in the adjoint bundle        𝔤  P   :=   P   ×  G   𝔤    .     assign   subscript  𝔤  P     superscript   G   P  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}_{P}:=P\times^{G}\mathfrak{g}.   Conversely, any such one form defines (via pullback) a G -equivariant horizontal 1-form on P , and the space of principal G -connections is an affine space for this space of 1-forms.  Induced covariant and exterior derivatives  For any linear representation  W of G there is an associated vector bundle     P   ×  G   W      superscript   G   P  W    P\times^{G}W   over M , and a principal connection induces a covariant derivative on any such vector bundle. This covariant derivative can be defined using the fact that the space of sections of    P   ×  G   W      superscript   G   P  W    P\times^{G}W   over M is isomorphic to the space of G -equivariant W -valued functions on P . More generally, the space of k -forms with values in     P   ×  G   W      superscript   G   P  W    P\times^{G}W   is identified with the space of G -equivariant and horizontal W -valued k -forms on P . If α is such a k -form, then its exterior derivative d α , although G -equivariant, is no longer horizontal. However, the combination d α + ω Λ α is. This defines an exterior covariant derivative d ω from    P   ×  G   W      superscript   G   P  W    P\times^{G}W   -valued k -forms on M to    P   ×  G   W      superscript   G   P  W    P\times^{G}W   -valued ( k +1)-forms on M . In particular, when k =0, we obtain a covariant derivative on    P   ×  G   W      superscript   G   P  W    P\times^{G}W   .  Curvature form  The curvature form of a principal G -connection ω is the   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -valued 2-form Ω defined by       Ω  =    d  ω   +     1  2     [   ω  ∧  ω   ]      .      normal-Ω      d  ω       1  2    delimited-[]    ω  ω        \Omega=d\omega+\tfrac{1}{2}[\omega\wedge\omega].   It is G -equivariant and horizontal, hence corresponds to a 2-form on M with values in    𝔤  P     subscript  𝔤  P    \mathfrak{g}_{P}   . The identification of the curvature with this quantity is sometimes called the second structure equation .  Connections on frame bundles and torsion  If the principal bundle P is the frame bundle , or (more generally) if it has a solder form , then the connection is an example of an affine connection , and the curvature is not the only invariant, since the additional structure of the solder form θ , which is an equivariant R n -valued 1-form on P , should be taken into account. In particular, the torsion form on P , is an R n -valued 2-form Θ defined by       Θ  =     d  θ   +  ω   ∧  θ    .      normal-Θ        normal-d  θ   ω   θ     \Theta=\mathrm{d}\theta+\omega\wedge\theta.   Θ is G -equivariant and horizontal, and so it descends to a tangent-valued 2-form on M , called the torsion . This equation is sometimes called the first structure equation .
