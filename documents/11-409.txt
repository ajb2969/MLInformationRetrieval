3',5'-cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase




3',5'-cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase

In enzymology, a 3',5'-cyclic-GMP phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

guanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  guanosine 5'-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are guanosine 3',5'-cyclic phosphate and H2O, whereas its product is guanosine 5'-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3',5'-cyclic-GMP 5'-nucleotidohydrolase. Other names in common use include guanosine cyclic 3',5'-phosphate phosphodiesterase, cyclic GMP phosphodiesterase, cyclic 3',5'-GMP phosphodiesterase, cyclic guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate phosphodiesterase, cyclic guanosine 3',5'-phosphate phosphodiesterase, cGMP phosphodiesterase, cGMP-PDE, and cyclic guanosine 3',5'-phosphate phosphodiesterase.
