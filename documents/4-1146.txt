Universal generalization

In predicate logic, generalization (also universal generalization or universal introduction,123 GEN) is a valid inference rule. It states that if 
 
 
 
  has been derived, then 
 
 
 
  can be derived.
Generalization with hypotheses
The full generalization rule allows for hypotheses to the left of the turnstile, but with restrictions. Assume Γ is a set of formulas, φ a formula, and 
 
 
 
  has been derived. The generalization rule states that 
 
 
 
 
  can be derived if y is not mentioned in Γ and x does not occur in φ.
These restrictions are necessary for soundness. Without the first restriction, one could conclude 
 
 
 
  from the hypothesis 
 
 
 
 . Without the second restriction, one could make the following deduction:



 
  (Hypothesis)


 
  (Existential instantiation)


 
 
  (Existential instantiation)


 
  (Faulty universal generalization)

This purports to show that 
 
 
 
  which is an unsound deduction.

From (9) by Deduction theorem

From (10) by Deduction theorem



In this proof, Universal generalization was used in step 8. The Deduction theorem was applicable in steps 10 and 11 because the formulas being moved have no free variables.
