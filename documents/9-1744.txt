   Displacement–length ratio      Displacement–length ratio   The displacement–length ratio ( DLR or D/L ratio ) is a calculation used to express how heavy a boat is relative to its waterline length. (Rousmaniere, 1999)  A DLR is calculated by dividing a boat's displacement in long tons (2,240 pounds) by the cube of one one-hundredth of the waterline length (in feet):       𝐷𝐿𝑅  =     𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡   (  lb  )    /  2240     (    0.01  ×  𝐿𝑊𝐿    (  ft  )    )   3     .      𝐷𝐿𝑅        𝑑𝑖𝑠𝑝𝑙𝑎𝑐𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡  lb   2240    superscript      0.01  𝐿𝑊𝐿   ft   3      \mathit{DLR}=\frac{\mathit{displacement}(\mathrm{lb})~{}/~{}2240}{(0.01\times%
 \mathit{LWL}(\mathrm{ft}))^{3}}.     The DLR can be used to compare the relative mass of various boats no matter what their length. A DLR less than 200 is indicative of a racing boat, while a DLR greater than 300 or so is indicative of a heavy cruising boat.
