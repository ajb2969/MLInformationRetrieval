   Reticuline oxidase      Reticuline oxidase   In enzymology , a reticuline oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-reticuline + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (S)-scoulerine + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-reticuline and O 2 , whereas its two products are (S)-scoulerine and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-reticuline:oxygen oxidoreductase (methylene-bridge-forming) . Other names in common use include BBE , berberine bridge enzyme , berberine-bridge-forming enzyme , and tetrahydroprotoberberine synthase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .
