Phillips–Perron test
In [[statistics]], the '''Phillips–Perron test''' (named after [[Peter C. B. Phillips]] and [[Pierre Perron]]) is a [[unit root]] test.{{cite doi|10.1093/biomet/75.2.335}}  That is, it is used in [[time series]] analysis to test the [[null hypothesis]] that a time se
 ries is integrated of order 1. It builds on the Dickey–Fuller test of the null hypothesis 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the first difference operator. Like the augmented Dickey–Fuller test, the Phillips–Perron test addresses the issue that the process generating data for 
 
 
 
  might have a higher order of autocorrelation than is admitted in the test equation—making 
 
 
 
  endogenous and thus invalidating the Dickey–Fuller t-test. Whilst the augmented Dickey–Fuller test addresses this issue by introducing lags of 
 
 
 
  as regressors in the test equation, the Phillips–Perron test makes a non-parametric correction to the t-test statistic. The test is robust with respect to unspecified autocorrelation and heteroscedasticity in the disturbance process of the test equation.
Davidson and MacKinnon (2004) report that the Phillips–Perron test performs worse in finite samples than the augmented Dickey–Fuller test.1
