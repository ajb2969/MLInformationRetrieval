   Microtubule-severing ATPase      Microtubule-severing ATPase   In enzymology , a microtubule-severing ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O $\rightleftharpoons$ ADP + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ADP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to facilitate cellular and subcellular movement. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (tubulin-dimerizing) .  See also   Katanin   References      "  Category:EC 3.6.4
