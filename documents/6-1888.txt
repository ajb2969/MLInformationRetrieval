Coframe

In mathematics, a coframe or coframe field on a smooth manifold

 
  is a system of one-forms or covectors which form a basis of the cotangent bundle at every point. In the exterior algebra of 
 
 
 
 , one has a natural map from 
 
 
 
 , given by 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  dimensional a coframe is given by a section 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . The inverse image under 
 
 
 
  of the complement of the zero section of 
 
 
 
  forms a 
 
 
principal bundle over 
 
 
 
 , which is called the coframe bundle.
