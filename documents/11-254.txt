   Trichodiene synthase      Trichodiene synthase   In enzymology , a trichodiene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trans,trans-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   trichodiene + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , trans,trans-farnesyl diphosphate , and two products , trichodiene and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trans,trans-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, trichodiene-forming) . Other names in common use include trichodiene synthetase , sesquiterpene cyclase , and trans,trans-farnesyl-diphosphate sesquiterpenoid-lyase . This enzyme participates in terpenoid biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 9 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , and .
