   L-reduction      L-reduction   In computer science , particularly the study of approximation algorithms , an L-reduction (" linear reduction ") is a transformation of optimization problems which linearly preserves approximability features; it is one type of approximation-preserving reduction . L-reductions in studies of approximability of optimization problems play a similar role to that of polynomial reductions in the studies of computational complexity of decision problems .  The term L reduction is sometimes used to refer to log-space reductions , by analogy with the complexity class L , but this is a different concept.  Definition  Let A and B be optimization problems and c A and c B their respective cost functions. A pair of functions f and g is an L-reduction if all of the following conditions are met:   functions f and g are computable in polynomial time ,  if x is an instance of problem A, then f ( x ) is an instance of problem B,  if ''y' '' is a solution to f ( x ), then g (''y' '') is a solution to x ,  there exists a positive constant α such that         OPT  B    (   f   (  x  )    )    ≤   α   OPT  A    (  x  )           subscript  OPT  normal-B     f  x      α   subscript  OPT  normal-A   x     \mathrm{OPT_{B}}(f(x))\leq\alpha\mathrm{OPT_{A}}(x)   ,   there exists a positive constant β such that for every solution ''y' '' to f ( x )        |     OPT  A    (  x  )    -    c  A    (   g   (   y  ′   )    )     |   ≤   β   |     OPT  B    (   f   (  x  )    )    -    c  B    (   y  ′   )     |               subscript  OPT  normal-A   x      subscript  c  A     g   superscript  y  normal-′         β         subscript  OPT  normal-B     f  x       subscript  c  B    superscript  y  normal-′         |\mathrm{OPT_{A}}(x)-c_{A}(g(y^{\prime}))|\leq\beta|\mathrm{OPT_{B}}(f(x))-c_{%
 B}(y^{\prime})|   .  Properties  Implication of PTAS reduction  An L-reduction from problem A to problem B implies an AP-reduction when A and B are minimization problems and a PTAS reduction when A and B are maximization problems. In both cases, when B has a PTAS and there is a L-reduction from A to B, then A also has a PTAS. 1 2 This enables the use of L-reduction as a replacement for showing the existence of a PTAS-reduction; Crescenzi has suggested that the more natural formulation of L-reduction is actually more useful in many cases due to ease of usage. 3  Proof (minimization case)  Let the approximation ratio of B be    1  +  δ      1  δ    1+\delta   . Begin with the approximation ratio of A,      c  A    (  y  )     O  P   T  A    (  x  )           subscript  c  A   y     O  P   subscript  T  A   x     \frac{c_{A}(y)}{OPT_{A}(x)}   . We can remove absolute values around the third condition of the L-reduction definition since we know A and B are minimization problems. Substitute that condition to obtain         c  A    (  y  )     O  P   T  A    (  x  )     ≤     O  P   T  A    (  x  )    +   β   (     c  B    (   y  ′   )    -   O  P   T  B    (   x  ′   )     )      O  P   T  A    (  x  )              subscript  c  A   y     O  P   subscript  T  A   x          O  P   subscript  T  A   x     β       subscript  c  B    superscript  y  normal-′      O  P   subscript  T  B    superscript  x  normal-′         O  P   subscript  T  A   x      \frac{c_{A}(y)}{OPT_{A}(x)}\leq\frac{OPT_{A}(x)+\beta(c_{B}(y^{\prime})-OPT_{B%
 }(x^{\prime}))}{OPT_{A}(x)}   Simplifying, and substituting the first condition, we have         c  A    (  y  )     O  P   T  A    (  x  )     ≤   1  +   α  β   (      c  B    (   y  ′   )    -   O  P   T  B    (   x  ′   )      O  P   T  B    (   x  ′   )     )              subscript  c  A   y     O  P   subscript  T  A   x      1    α  β         subscript  c  B    superscript  y  normal-′      O  P   subscript  T  B    superscript  x  normal-′       O  P   subscript  T  B    superscript  x  normal-′         \frac{c_{A}(y)}{OPT_{A}(x)}\leq 1+\alpha\beta\left(\frac{c_{B}(y^{\prime})-OPT%
 _{B}(x^{\prime})}{OPT_{B}(x^{\prime})}\right)   But the term in parentheses on the right-hand side actually equals   δ   δ   \delta   . Thus, the approximation ratio of A is    1  +   α  β  δ       1    α  β  δ     1+\alpha\beta\delta   .  This meets the conditions for AP-reduction.  Proof (maximization case)  Let the approximation ratio of B be    1   1  -   δ  ′        1    1   superscript  δ  normal-′      \frac{1}{1-\delta^{\prime}}   . Begin with the approximation ratio of A,      c  A    (  y  )     O  P   T  A    (  x  )           subscript  c  A   y     O  P   subscript  T  A   x     \frac{c_{A}(y)}{OPT_{A}(x)}   . We can remove absolute values around the third condition of the L-reduction definition since we know A and B are maximization problems. Substitute that condition to obtain         c  A    (  y  )     O  P   T  A    (  x  )     ≥     O  P   T  A    (  x  )    -   β   (     c  B    (   y  ′   )    -   O  P   T  B    (   x  ′   )     )      O  P   T  A    (  x  )              subscript  c  A   y     O  P   subscript  T  A   x          O  P   subscript  T  A   x     β       subscript  c  B    superscript  y  normal-′      O  P   subscript  T  B    superscript  x  normal-′         O  P   subscript  T  A   x      \frac{c_{A}(y)}{OPT_{A}(x)}\geq\frac{OPT_{A}(x)-\beta(c_{B}(y^{\prime})-OPT_{B%
 }(x^{\prime}))}{OPT_{A}(x)}   Simplifying, and substituting the first condition, we have         c  A    (  y  )     O  P   T  A    (  x  )     ≥   1  -   α  β   (      c  B    (   y  ′   )    -   O  P   T  B    (   x  ′   )      O  P   T  B    (   x  ′   )     )              subscript  c  A   y     O  P   subscript  T  A   x      1    α  β         subscript  c  B    superscript  y  normal-′      O  P   subscript  T  B    superscript  x  normal-′       O  P   subscript  T  B    superscript  x  normal-′         \frac{c_{A}(y)}{OPT_{A}(x)}\geq 1-\alpha\beta\left(\frac{c_{B}(y^{\prime})-OPT%
 _{B}(x^{\prime})}{OPT_{B}(x^{\prime})}\right)   But the term in parentheses on the right-hand side actually equals    δ  ′     superscript  δ  normal-′    \delta^{\prime}   . Thus, the approximation ratio of A is    1   1  -   α  β   δ  ′         1    1    α  β   superscript  δ  normal-′       \frac{1}{1-\alpha\beta\delta^{\prime}}   .  If     1   1  -   α  β   δ  ′      =   1  +  ϵ         1    1    α  β   superscript  δ  normal-′        1  ϵ     \frac{1}{1-\alpha\beta\delta^{\prime}}=1+\epsilon   , then     1   1  -   δ  ′     =   1  +   ϵ    α  β   (   1  +  ϵ   )    -  ϵ           1    1   superscript  δ  normal-′       1    ϵ      α  β    1  ϵ    ϵ       \frac{1}{1-\delta^{\prime}}=1+\frac{\epsilon}{\alpha\beta(1+\epsilon)-\epsilon}   , which meets the requirements for PTAS reduction but not AP-reduction.  Other properties  L-reductions also imply P-reduction . 4 One may deduce that L-reductions imply PTAS reductions from this fact and the fact that P-reductions imply PTAS reductions.  L-reductions preserve membership in APX for the minimizing case only, as a result of implying AP-reductions.
