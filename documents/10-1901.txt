   Phosphonopyruvate hydrolase      Phosphonopyruvate hydrolase   In enzymology , a phosphonopyruvate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-phosphonopyruvate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-phosphonopyruvate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are pyruvate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon-phosphorus bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ' '. This enzyme is also called PPH .
