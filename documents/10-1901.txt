Phosphonopyruvate hydrolase

In enzymology, a phosphonopyruvate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-phosphonopyruvate + H2O 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-phosphonopyruvate and H2O, whereas its two products are pyruvate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carbon-phosphorus bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ''. This enzyme is also called PPH.
