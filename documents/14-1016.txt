   Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture      Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture   In mathematics , the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture is a conjecture relating étale cohomology to algebraic K-theory introduced by , who was inspired by earlier conjectures of .  and  proved the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture at the prime 2 for some number fields. Rost and Voevodsky have announced proofs of the Bloch–Kato conjecture , which implies the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture for all primes.  Statement  The conjecture in Quillen's original form states that if A is a finitely-generated algebra over the integers and l is prime, then there is a spectral sequence analogous to the Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence , starting at        E  2   p  q    =    H  étale  p    (   Spec  A   [   ℓ   -  1    ]    ,    Z  ℓ    (   -   q  /  2    )    )     ,       superscript   subscript  E  2     p  q       subscript   superscript  H  p   étale      Spec  A   delimited-[]   superscript  normal-ℓ    1         subscript  Z  normal-ℓ       q  2         E_{2}^{pq}=H^{p}_{\text{étale}}(\text{Spec }A[\ell^{-1}],Z_{\ell}(-q/2)),   (which is understood to be 0 if q is odd)  and abutting to        K    -  p   -  q    A   ⊗   Z  ℓ      tensor-product     subscript  K      p   q    A    subscript  Z  normal-ℓ     K_{-p-q}A\otimes Z_{\ell}     for − p − q > 1 + dim A .  K -theory of the integers  Assuming the Quillen–Lichtenbaum conjecture and the Vandiver conjecture , the K -groups of the integers, K n ( Z ), are given by:   0 if n = 0 mod 8 and n > 0, Z if n = 0  Z ⊕ Z /2 if n = 1 mod 8 and n > 1, Z /2 if n = 1.  Z / c k ⊕ Z /2 if n = 2 mod 8  Z /8 d k if n = 3 mod 8  0 if n = 4 mod 8  Z if n = 5 mod 8  Z / c k if n = 6 mod 8  Z /4 d k if n = 7 mod 8   where c k / d k is the Bernoulli number  B 2 k / k in lowest terms and n is 4 k − 1 or 4 k − 2 .
