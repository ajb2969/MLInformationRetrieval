   2,3-dihydroxyindole 2,3-dioxygenase      2,3-dihydroxyindole 2,3-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 2,3-dihydroxyindole 2,3-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,3-dihydroxyindole + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   anthranilate + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2,3-dihydroxyindole and O 2 , whereas its two products are anthranilate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,3-dihydroxyindole:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
