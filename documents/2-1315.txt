Negative resistance

thumb|upright=1.3|Fluorescent lamp, a device with negative differential resistance.12 In operation, an increase in current through the fluorescent tube causes a drop in voltage across it. If the tube were connected directly to the power line, the falling tube voltage would cause more and more current to flow, until it destroyed itself.34 To prevent this, fluorescent tubes are connected to the power line through a ballast. The ballast adds positive impedance (AC resistance) to the circuit to counteract the negative resistance of the tube, limiting the current.5
In electronics, negative resistance (NR) is a property of some electrical circuits and devices in which an increase in voltage across the device's terminals results in a decrease in electric current through it.67
This is in contrast to an ordinary resistor in which an increase of applied voltage causes a proportional increase in current due to Ohm's law, resulting in a positive resistance.8 While a positive resistance consumes power from current passing through it, a negative resistance produces power.910 Under certain conditions it can increase the power of an electrical signal, amplifying it.111213
Negative resistance is an uncommon property which occurs in a few nonlinear electronic components. In a nonlinear device, two types of resistance can be defined: 'static' or 'absolute resistance', the ratio of voltage to current 
 
 
 
 , and differential resistance, the ratio of a change in voltage to the resulting change in current 
 
 
 
 . The term negative resistance refers to negative differential resistance (NDR), 
 
 
 
 . In general, a negative differential resistance is a two-terminal component which can amplify,1415 converting DC power applied to its terminals to AC output power to amplify an AC signal applied to the same terminals.1617 They are used in electronic oscillators and amplifiers,18 particularly at microwave frequencies. Most microwave energy is produced with negative differential resistance devices.19 They can also have hysteresis20 and be bistable, and so are used in switching and memory circuits.21 Examples of devices with negative differential resistance are tunnel diodes, Gunn diodes, and gas discharge tubes such as neon lamps. In addition, circuits containing amplifying devices such as transistors and op amps with positive feedback can have negative differential resistance. These are used in oscillators and active filters.
Because they are nonlinear, negative resistance devices have a more complicated behavior than the positive "ohmic" resistances usually encountered in electric circuits. Unlike most positive resistances, negative resistance varies depending on the voltage or current applied to the device, and negative resistance devices can have negative resistance over only a limited portion of their voltage or current range.2223 Therefore, there is no real "negative resistor" analogous to a positive resistor, which has a constant negative resistance over an arbitrarily wide range of current.

In addition, active circuits with negative differential resistance can also be built with amplifying devices like transistors and op amps, using feedback.505152 A number of new experimental negative differential resistance materials and devices have been discovered in recent years.53 The physical processes which cause negative resistance are diverse,545556 and each type of device has its own negative resistance characteristics, specified by its current–voltage curve.5758
Definitions
thumb|upright=0.8|An I–V curve, showing the difference between static resistance (inverse slope of line B) and differential resistance (inverse slope of line C) at a point (A).
The resistance between two terminals of an electrical device or circuit is determined by its current–voltage (I–V) curve (characteristic curve), giving the current 
 
 
 
  through it for any given voltage 
 
 
 
  across it.59 Most materials, including the ordinary (positive) resistances encountered in electrical circuits, obey Ohm's law; the current through them is proportional to the voltage over a wide range.60 So the I–V curve of an ohmic resistance is a straight line through the origin with positive slope. The resistance is the ratio of voltage to current, the inverse slope of the line (in I–V graphs where the voltage 
 
 
 
  is the independent variable) and is constant.
Negative resistance occurs in a few nonlinear (nonohmic) devices.61 In a nonlinear component the I–V curve is not a straight line,6263 so it does not obey Ohm's law.64 Resistance can still be defined, but the resistance is not constant; it varies with the voltage or current through the device.6566 The resistance of such a nonlinear device can be defined in two ways,676869 which are equal for ohmic resistances:70
thumb|upright=0.9|The quadrants of the I–V plane,7172 showing regions representing passive devices (white) and active devices (red)

Static resistance (also called chordal resistance, absolute resistance or just resistance) – This is the common definition of resistance; the voltage divided by the current:737475





 
 .
 


It is the inverse slope of the line (chord) from the origin through the point on the I–V curve.76 In a power source, like a battery or electric generator, positive current flows out of the positive voltage terminal,77 opposite to the direction of current in a resistor, so from the passive sign convention

 
  and 
 
 
 
  have opposite signs, representing points lying in the 2nd or 4th quadrant of the I–V plane (diagram right). Thus power sources formally have negative static resistance (
 
 
787980 However this term is never used in practice, because the term "resistance" is only applied to passive components.818283 Static resistance determines the power dissipation in a component.8485 Passive devices, which consume electric power, have positive static resistance; while active devices, which produce electric power, do not.868788



Differential resistance (also called dynamic,8990 or incremental91 resistance) – This is the derivative of the voltage with respect to the current; the ratio of a small change in voltage to the corresponding change in current,92 the inverse slope of the I–V curve at a point:





 
 .
 


Differential resistance is only relevant to time-varying currents.93 Points on the curve where the slope is negative (declining to the right), meaning an increase in voltage causes a decrease in current, have negative differential resistance .9495969798 Devices of this type can amplify signals,99100101 and are what is usually meant by the term "negative resistance".102103


Negative resistance, like positive resistance, is measured in ohms.
Conductance is the reciprocal of resistance.104105 It is measured in siemens (formerly mho) which is the conductance of a resistor with a resistance of one ohm.106 Each type of resistance defined above has a corresponding conductance107

Static conductance










Differential conductance









It can be seen that the conductance has the same sign as its corresponding resistance: a negative resistance will have a negative conductance108 while a positive resistance will have a positive conductance.109110
How it works
One way in which the different types of resistance can be distinguished is in the directions that current and electric power flow between a circuit and an electronic component. The illustrations below, with a rectangle representing the component attached to a circuit, summarize how the different types work:




The voltage v and current i variables in an electrical component must be defined according to the passive sign convention; positive conventional current is defined to enter the positive voltage terminal; this means power P flowing from the circuit into the component is defined to be positive, while power flowing from the component into the circuit is negative.111112 This applies to both DC and AC current. The diagram shows the directions for positive values of the variables.
(Figure)
Passive sign convention.svg




In a positive static resistance, 
 
 
 
 , so v and i have the same sign.{{cite book

last = Chua



In a power source, 
 
 
 
 ,113 so 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have opposite signs.114 This means current is forced to flow from the negative to the positive terminal.115 The charges gain potential energy, so power flows out of the device into the circuit:116117

 
 . Work (yellow) must be done on the charges by some power source in the device to make them move in this direction against the force of the electric field.

In a passive negative differential resistance, 
 
 
 
 , only the AC component of the current flows in the reverse direction. The static resistance is positive118119120 so the current flows from positive to negative
 
 
 
 . But the current (rate of charge flow) decreases as the voltage increases. So when a time-varying (AC) voltage is applied in addition to a DC voltage (right), the time-varying current 
 
 
 
  and voltage 
 
 
 
  components have opposite signs, so 
 
 
 
 .121 This means the instantaneous 
 
 
 
  flows through the device in the direction of increasing 
 
 
 
 , so AC power flows out of the device into the circuit. The device consumes DC power, some of which is converted to AC signal power which can be delivered to a load in the external circuit,122123 enabling the device to amplify the AC signal applied to it.124

{{-}} In an electronic device, the differential resistance 
 
 
 
 , the static resistance 
 
 
 
 , or both, can be nonpositive,125 so there are three categories of devices (fig. 1–3 above, and table) which could be called "negative resistances".
The term "negative resistance" almost always means negative differential resistance 126127128 Negative differential resistance devices have unique capabilities: they can act as one-port amplifiers,129130131132 increasing the power of a time-varying signal applied to their port (terminals), or excite oscillations in a tuned circuit to make an oscillator.133134135 They can also have hysteresis.136137 It is not possible for a device to have negative differential resistance without a power source,138 and these devices can be divided into two categories depending on whether they get their power from an internal source or from their port:139140141142143
(Figure)
Diagram negative resistance.GIF


Passive negative differential resistance devices (fig. 1 above): These are the most well-known type of "negative resistances"; passive two-terminal components whose intrinsic I–V curve has a downward "kink", causing the current to decrease with increasing voltage over a limited range.144145 The I–V curve, including the negative resistance region, lies in the 1st and 3rd quadrant of the plane146 so the device has positive static resistance.147 Examples are gas-discharge tubes, tunnel diodes, and Gunn diodes.148 These devices have no power source and in general work by converting external DC power from their port to time varying (AC) power,149 so they require a DC bias current applied to the port in addition to the signal.150151 To add to the confusion, some authors152153154 call these "active" devices, since they can amplify. This category also includes a few three-terminal devices, such as the unijunction transistor.155 They are covered in the Negative differential resistance section below.

(Figure)
Active negative differential resistances.svg


Active negative differential resistance devices (fig. 3): Circuits can be designed in which a positive voltage applied to the terminals will cause a proportional "negative" current; a current out of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor, over a limited range,156157158159160 Unlike in the above devices, the downward-sloping region of the I–V curve passes through the origin, so it lies in the 2nd and 4th quadrants of the plane, meaning the device sources power.161 Amplifying devices like transistors and op-amps with positive feedback can have this type of negative resistance,162163164165 and are used in feedback oscillators and active filters.166167 Since these circuits produce net power from their port, they must have an internal DC power source, or else a separate connection to an external power supply.168169170 In circuit theory this is called an "active resistor".171172173174 It is often simply referred to as "negative resistance"175176 in electronics, although sometimes terms like "linear",177178 "absolute",179 "ideal", or "pure" are added to distinguish this type from "passive" negative differential resistances. These are covered in the Active resistors section below.

thumb|upright=0.7|A battery has negative static resistance180181182 .(red) over its normal operating range, but positive differential resistance.
Occasionally ordinary power sources are referred to as "negative resistances"183184185186 (fig. 2). Although the "static" or "absolute" resistance 
 
 
 
  of active devices (power sources) can be considered negative (see Negative static resistance section below) most ordinary power sources (AC or DC), such as batteries, generators, and (non positive feedback) amplifiers, have positive differential resistance (their source resistance).187188 Therefore, these devices cannot function as one-port amplifiers or have the other capabilities of negative differential resistances.
Negative static or "absolute" resistance
A point of some confusion is whether ordinary resistance ("static" or "absolute" resistance, 
 
 
 
 ) can be negative.189190 In electronics, the term "resistance" is customarily applied only to passive materials and components191 – such as wires, resistors and diodes. These cannot have 
 
 
 
  as shown by Joule's law

 
 .192 A passive device consumes electric power, so from the passive sign convention

 
 . Therefore, from Joule's law 
 
 
 
 .193194 In other words, no material can conduct electric current better than a "perfect" conductor with zero resistance.195196 For a passive device to have 
 
 
 
  would violate either conservation of energy197 or the second law of thermodynamics,198199200201 (diagram). Therefore, some authors202203204 state that static resistance can never be negative.
thumb|upright=0.7|From KVL, the static resistance of a power source (RS), such as a battery, is always equal to the negative of the static resistance of its load (RL).205206 
However it is easily shown that the ratio of voltage to current v/i at the terminals of any power source (AC or DC) is negative.207 For electric power (potential energy) to flow out of a device into the circuit, charge must flow through the device in the direction of increasing potential energy, conventional current (positive charge) must move from the negative to the positive terminal.208209210 So the direction of the instantaneous current is out of the positive terminal. This is opposite to the direction of current in a passive device defined by the passive sign convention so the current and voltage have opposite signs, and their ratio is negative


 
  This can also be proved from Joule's law211212213


 
  This shows that power can flow out of a device into the circuit  if and only if 
 
 
 
 .214215216217 Whether or not this quantity is referred to as "resistance" when negative is a matter of convention. The absolute resistance of power sources is negative,218219 but this is not to be regarded as "resistance" in the same sense as positive resistances. The negative static resistance of a power source is a rather abstract and not very useful quantity, because it varies with the load. Due to conservation of energy it is always simply equal to the negative of the static resistance of the attached circuit (right).220221
Work must be done on the charges by some source of energy in the device, to make them move toward the positive terminal against the electric field, so conservation of energy requires that negative static resistances have a source of power.222223224225 The power may come from an internal source which converts some other form of energy to electric power as in a battery or generator, or from a separate connection to an external power supply circuit226 as in an amplifying device like a transistor, vacuum tube, or op amp.
Eventual passivity
A circuit cannot have negative static resistance (be active) over an infinite voltage or current range, because it would have to be able to produce infinite power.227 Any active circuit or device with a finite power source is "eventually passive".228229230 This property means if a large enough external voltage or current of either polarity is applied to it, its static resistance becomes positive231




where 
 
 
 
  is the maximum power the device can produce.
 

Therefore, the ends of the I–V curve will eventually turn and enter the 1st and 3rd quadrants.232 Thus the range of the curve having negative static resistance is limited,233 confined to a region around the origin. For example, applying a voltage to a generator or battery (graph, above) greater than its open-circuit voltage234 will reverse the direction of current flow, making its static resistance positive so it consumes power. Similarly, applying a voltage to the negative impedance converter below greater than its power supply voltage Vs will cause the amplifier to saturate, also making its resistance positive.
Negative differential resistance
In a device or circuit with negative differential resistance (NDR), in some part of the I–V curve the current decreases as the voltage increases:235


 
  The I–V curve is nonmonotonic (having peaks and troughs) with regions of negative slope representing negative differential resistance.  Passive negative differential resistances have positive static resistance;236237238 they consume net power. Therefore, the I–V curve is confined to the 1st and 3rd quadrants of the graph,239 and passes through the origin. This requirement means (excluding some asymptotic cases) that the region(s) of negative resistance must be limited,240241 and surrounded by regions of positive resistance, and cannot include the origin.242243
Types
Negative differential resistances can be classified into two types:244245

Voltage controlled negative resistance (VCNR, short-circuit stable,246247248 or "N" type): In this type the current is a single valued, continuous function of the voltage, but the voltage is a multivalued function of the current.249 In the most common type there is only one negative resistance region, and the graph is a curve shaped generally like the letter "N". As the voltage is increased, the current increases (positive resistance) until it reaches a maximum (i1), then decreases in the region of negative resistance to a minimum (i2), then increases again. Devices with this type of negative resistance include the tunnel diode,250 resonant tunneling diode,251 lambda diode, Gunn diode,252 and dynatron oscillators.253254


Current controlled negative resistance (CCNR, open-circuit stable,255256257 or "S" type): In this type, the dual of the VCNR, the voltage is a single valued function of the current, but the current is a multivalued function of the voltage.258 In the most common type, with one negative resistance region, the graph is a curve shaped like the letter "S". Devices with this type of negative resistance include the IMPATT diode,259 UJT,260 SCRs and other thyristors,261 electric arc, and gas discharge tubes like thyratron tubes, fluorescent lamps and neon lights.262

Most devices have a single negative resistance region. However devices with multiple separate negative resistance regions can also be fabricated.263264 These can have more than two stable states, and are of interest for use in digital circuits to implement multivalued logic.265266
An intrinsic parameter used to compare different devices is the peak-to-valley current ratio (PVR),267 the ratio of the current at the top of the negative resistance region to the current at the bottom (see graphs, above):


 
  The larger this is, the larger the potential AC output for a given DC bias current, and therefore the greater the efficiency
Amplification
A negative differential resistance device can amplify an AC signal applied to it268269 if the signal is biased with a DC voltage or current to lie within the negative resistance region of its I–V curve.270271
The tunnel diode circuit is an example.272 The tunnel diode TD has voltage controlled negative differential resistance.273 The battery 
 
 
 
  adds a constant voltage (bias) across the diode so it operates in its negative resistance range, and provides power to amplify the signal. Suppose the negative resistance at the bias point is 
 
 
 
 . For stability 
 
 
 
  must be less than 
 
 
 
 .274 Using the formula for a voltage divider, the AC output voltage is275


 
   so the voltage gain is  
 
 
 
  In a normal voltage divider, the resistance of each branch is less than the resistance of the whole, so the output voltage is less than the input. Here, due to the negative resistance, the total AC resistance 
 
 
 
  is less than the resistance of the diode alone 
 
 
 
  so the AC output voltage 
 
 
 
  is greater than the input 
 
 
 
 . The voltage gain 
 
 
 
  is greater than one, and increases without limit as 
 
 
 
  approaches 
 
 
 
 .
Explanation of power gain
The diagrams illustrate how a biased negative differential resistance device can increase the power of a signal applied to it, amplifying it, although it only has two terminals. Due to the superposition principle the voltage and current at the device's terminals can be divided into a DC bias component  and an AC component .





 
  Since a positive change in voltage 
 
 
 
  causes a negative change in current 
 
 
 
 , the AC current and voltage in the device are 180° out of phase.276277278279 This means in the AC equivalent circuit (right), the instantaneous AC current Δi flows through the device in the direction of increasing AC potential Δv, as it would in a generator.280 Therefore, the AC power dissipation is negative; AC power is produced by the device and flows into the external circuit.281


 
  With the proper external circuit, the device can increase the AC signal power delivered to a load, serving as an amplifier,282 or excite oscillations in a resonant circuit to make an oscillator. Unlike in a two port amplifying device such as a transistor or op amp, the amplified signal leaves the device through the same two terminals (port) as the input signal enters.283
In a passive device, the AC power produced comes from the input DC bias current,284 the device absorbs DC power, some of which is converted to AC power by the nonlinearity of the device, amplifying the applied signal. Therefore, the output power is limited by the bias power285


 
  The negative differential resistance region cannot include the origin, because it would then be able to amplify a signal with no applied DC bias current, producing AC power with no power input.286287288 The device also dissipates some power as heat, equal to the difference between the DC power in and the AC power out.
The device may also have reactance and therefore the phase difference between current and voltage may differ from 180° and may vary with frequency.289290291 As long as the real component of the impedance is negative (phase angle between 90° and 270°),292 the device will have negative resistance and can amplify.293294
The maximum AC output power is limited by size of the negative resistance region (
 
 
 
  in graphs above)295296



Reflection coefficient

 , connected to an external circuit represented by 
 
 
 
 . Both may have reactance 

The reason that the output signal can leave a negative resistance through the same port that the input signal enters is that from transmission line theory, the AC voltage or current at the terminals of a component can be divided into two oppositely moving waves, the incident wave

 
 , which travels toward the device, and the reflected wave

 
 , which travels away from the device.297 A negative differential resistance in a circuit can amplify if the magnitude of its reflection coefficient

 
 , the ratio of the reflected wave to the incident wave, is greater than one.298299


 
    where   
 
 
 
  The "reflected" (output) signal has larger amplitude than the incident; the device has "reflection gain".300 The reflection coefficient is determined by the AC impedance of the negative resistance device, 
 
 
 
 , and the impedance of the circuit attached to it, 
 
 
 
 .301 If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and the device will amplify. On the Smith chart, a graphical aide widely used in the design of high frequency circuits, negative differential resistance corresponds to points outside the unit circle 
 
 
 
 , the boundary of the conventional chart, so special "expanded" charts must be used.302303
Stability conditions
Because it is nonlinear, a circuit with negative differential resistance can have multiple equilibrium points (possible DC operating points), which lie on the I–V curve.304 An equilibrium point will be stable, so the circuit converges to it within some neighborhood of the point, if its poles are in the left half of the s plane (LHP), while a point is unstable, causing the circuit to oscillate or "latch up" (converge to another point), if its poles are on the jω axis or right half plane (RHP), respectively.305306 The equilibrium points are determined by the DC bias circuit, and their stability is determined by the AC impedance 
 
 
 
  of the external circuit. However, because of the different shapes of the curves, the condition for stability is different for VCNR and CCNR types of negative resistance:307308

In a CCNR (S-type) negative resistance, the resistance function 
 
 
 
  is single-valued. Therefore, stability is determined by the poles of the circuit's impedance equation
 
 
 
 .309310


For nonreactive circuits  a sufficient condition for stability is that the total resistance is positive311




so the CCNR is stable for312313314



Since CCNRs are stable with no load at all, they are called "open circuit stable".315316317318319



In a VCNR (N-type) negative resistance, the conductance function 
 
 
 
  is single-valued. Therefore, stability is determined by the poles of the admittance equation 
 
 
 
 .320321 For this reason the VCNR is sometimes referred to as a negative conductance.322323324


As above, for nonreactive circuits a sufficient condition for stability is that the total conductance in the circuit is positive325







so the VCNR is stable for326327



Since VCNRs are even stable with a short-circuited output, they are called "short circuit stable".328329330331


For general negative resistance circuits with reactance, the stability must be determined by standard tests like the Nyquist stability criterion.332 Alternatively, in high frequency circuit design, the values of 
 
 
 
  for which the circuit is stable are determined by a graphical technique using "stability circles" on a Smith chart.333
Operating regions and applications
For simple nonreactive negative resistance devices with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the different operating regions of the device can be illustrated by load lines on the I–V curve334 (see graphs).
The DC load line (DCL) is a straight line determined by the DC bias circuit, with equation


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the DC bias supply voltage and R is the resistance of the supply. The possible DC operating point(s) (Q points) occur where the DC load line intersects the I–V curve. For stability335

VCNRs require a low impedance bias , such as a voltage source.
CCNRs require a high impedance bias  such as a current source, or voltage source in series with a high resistance.

The AC load line (L1 − L3) is a straight line through the Q point whose slope is the differential (AC) resistance 
 
 
 
  facing the device. Increasing 
 
 
 
  rotates the load line counterclockwise. The circuit operates in one of three possible regions (see diagrams), depending on 
 
 
 
 .336

Stable region (green) (illustrated by line L1): When the load line lies in this region, it intersects the I–V curve at one point Q1.337 For nonreactive circuits it is a stable equilibrium (poles in the LHP) so the circuit is stable. Negative resistance amplifiers operate in this region. However, due to hysteresis, with an energy storage device like a capacitor or inductor the circuit can become unstable to make a nonlinear relaxation oscillator (astable multivibrator) or a monostable multivibrator.338

VCNRs are stable when 
 
 
 
 .
CCNRs are stable when 
 
 
 
 .

Unstable point (Line L2): When 
 
 
 
  the load line is tangent to the I–V curve. The total differential (AC) resistance of the circuit is zero (poles on the jω axis), so it is unstable and with a tuned circuit can oscillate. Linear oscillators operate at this point. Practical oscillators actually start in the unstable region below, with poles in the RHP, but as the amplitude increases the oscillations become nonlinear, and due to eventual passivity the negative resistance r decreases with increasing amplitude, so the oscillations stabilize at an amplitude where339

 
 .
Bistable region (red) (illustrated by line L3): In this region the load line can intersect the I–V curve at three points.340 The center point (Q1) is a point of unstable equilibrium (poles in the RHP), while the two outer points, Q2 and Q3 are stable equilibria. So with correct biasing the circuit can be bistable, it will converge to one of the two points Q2 or Q3 and can be switched between them with an input pulse. Switching circuits like flip-flops (bistable multivibrators) and Schmidt triggers operate in this region.
 
VCNRs can be bistable when 
 
 

CCNRs can be bistable when 
 
 



Active resistors – negative resistance from feedback

 so the input resistance is


If 
 
 
 
  it will have negative input resistance.]]
In addition to the passive devices with intrinsic negative differential resistance above, circuits with amplifying devices like transistors or op amps can have negative resistance at their ports.341342 The input or output impedance of an amplifier with enough positive feedback applied to it can be negative.343344345346 If 
 
 
 
  is the input resistance of the amplifier without feedback, 
 
 
 
  is the amplifier gain, and 
 
 
 
  is the transfer function of the feedback path, the input resistance with positive shunt feedback is347348


 
  So if the loop gain

 
  is greater than one, 
 
 
 
  will be negative. The circuit acts like a "negative linear resistor"349350351352 over a limited range,353 with I–V curve having a straight line segment through the origin with negative slope (see graphs).354355356357358 It has both negative differential resistance and is active


 
  and thus obeys Ohm's law as if it had a negative value of resistance −R,359360 over its linear range (such amplifiers can also have more complicated negative resistance I–V curves that do not pass through the origin).
These are often called "active resistors".361362363364 Applying a voltage across the terminals causes a proportional current out of the positive terminal, the opposite of an ordinary resistor.365366367 For example, connecting a battery to the terminals would cause the battery to charge rather than discharge.368
Considered as one-port devices, these circuits function similarly to the passive negative differential resistance components above, and like them can be used to make one-port amplifiers and oscillators369370 with the advantages that:

because they are active devices they do not require an external DC bias to provide power, and can be DC coupled,
the amount of negative resistance can be varied by adjusting the loop gain,
they can be linear circuit elements;371372373 the voltage is proportional to the current, so they do not cause harmonic distortion.

The I–V curve can have voltage-controlled ("N" type) or current-controlled ("S" type) negative resistance, depending on whether the feedback loop is connected in "shunt" or "series".374
Negative reactances (below) can also be created, so feedback circuits can be used to create "active" linear circuit elements, resistors, capacitors, and inductors, with negative values.375376 They are widely used in active filters377378 because they can create transfer functions that cannot be realized with positive circuit elements.379 Examples of circuits with this type of negative resistance are the negative impedance converter (NIC), gyrator, Deboo integrator,380381 frequency dependent negative resistance (FDNR),382 and generalized immittance converter (GIC).383384385
Feedback oscillators
If an LC circuit is connected across the input of a positive feedback amplifier like that above, the negative differential input resistance 
 
 
 
  can cancel the positive loss resistance 
 
 
 
  inherent in the tuned circuit.386 If 
 
 
 
  this will create in effect a tuned circuit with zero AC resistance (poles on the jω axis).387388 Spontaneous oscillation will be excited in the tuned circuit at its resonant frequency, sustained by the power from the amplifier. This is how feedback oscillators such as Hartley or Colpitts oscillators work.389390 This negative resistance model is an alternate way of analyzing feedback oscillator operation.391392393394395396397 All linear oscillator circuits have negative resistance398399400401 although in most feedback oscillators the tuned circuit is an integral part of the feedback network, so the circuit does not have negative resistance at all frequencies but only near the oscillation frequency.402
Q enhancement
A tuned circuit connected to a negative resistance which cancels some but not all of its parasitic loss resistance (so 
 
 
 
 ) will not oscillate, but the negative resistance will decrease the damping in the circuit (moving its poles toward the jω axis), increasing its Q factor so it has a narrower bandwidth and more selectivity.403404405406 Q enhancement, also called regeneration, was first used in the regenerative radio receiver invented by Edwin Armstrong in 1912407408 and later in "Q multipliers".409 It is widely used in active filters.410 For example, RF integrated circuits use integrated inductors to save space, consisting of a spiral conductor fabricated on chip. These have high losses and low Q, so to create high Q tuned circuits their Q is increased by applying negative resistance.411412
Chaotic circuits
Circuits which exhibit chaotic behavior can be considered quasi-periodic or nonperiodic oscillators, and like all oscillators require a negative resistance in the circuit to provide power.413 Chua's circuit, a simple nonlinear circuit widely used as the standard example of a chaotic system, requires a nonlinear active resistor component, sometimes called Chua's diode.414 This is usually synthesized using a negative impedance converter circuit.415
Negative impedance converter
A common example of an "active resistance" circuit is the negative impedance converter (NIC)416417418419 shown in the diagram. The two resistors 
 
 
 
  and the op amp constitute a negative feedback non-inverting amplifier with gain of 2.420 The output voltage of the op-amp is


 
  So if a voltage 
 
 
 
  is applied to the input, the same voltage is applied "backwards" across 
 
 
 
 , causing current to flow through it out of the input.421 The current is


 
  So the input impedance to the circuit is422


 
  The circuit converts the impedance 
 
 
 
  to its negative. If 
 
 
 
  is a resistor of value 
 
 
 
 , within the linear range of the op amp 
 
 
 
  the input impedance acts like a linear "negative resistor" of value 
 
 
 
 .423 The input port of the circuit is connected into another circuit as if it was a component. An NIC can cancel undesired positive resistance in another circuit,424 for example they were originally developed to cancel resistance in telephone cables, serving as repeaters.425
Negative capacitance and inductance
By replacing 
 
 
 
  in the above circuit with a capacitor , negative capacitances and inductances can also be synthesized.426427 A negative capacitance will have an I–V relation and an impedance

 
  of


 
  where 
 
 
 
 . Applying a positive current to a negative capacitance will cause it to discharge; its voltage will decrease. Similarly, a negative inductance will have an I–V characteristic and impedance 
 
 
 
  of


 
  A circuit having negative capacitance or inductance can be used to cancel unwanted positive capacitance or inductance in another circuit.428 NIC circuits were used to cancel reactance on telephone cables.
There is also another way of looking at them. In a negative capacitance the current will be 180° opposite in phase to the current in a positive capacitance. Instead of leading the voltage by 90° it will lag the voltage by 90°, as in an inductor.429 Therefore, a negative capacitance acts like an inductance in which the impedance has a reverse dependence on frequency ω; decreasing instead of increasing like a real inductance430 Similarly a negative inductance acts like a capacitance that has an impedance which increases with frequency. Negative capacitances and inductances are "non-Foster" circuits which violate Foster's reactance theorem.431 One application being researched is to create an active matching network which could match an antenna to a transmission line over a broad range of frequencies, rather than just a single frequency as with current networks.432 This would allow the creation of small compact antennas that would have broad bandwidth,433 exceeding the Chu–Harrington limit.
Oscillators
thumb|upright=0.8|An oscillator consisting of a Gunn diode inside a cavity resonator. The negative resistance of the diode excites microwave oscillations in the cavity, which radiate through the aperture into a waveguide (not shown). 
Negative differential resistance devices are widely used to make electronic oscillators.434435436 In a negative resistance oscillator, a negative differential resistance device such as an IMPATT diode, Gunn diode, or microwave vacuum tube is connected across an electrical resonator such as an LC circuit, a quartz crystal, dielectric resonator or cavity resonator437 with a DC source to bias the device into its negative resistance region and provide power.438439 A resonator such as an LC circuit is "almost" an oscillator; it can store oscillating electrical energy, but because all resonators have internal resistance or other losses, the oscillations are damped and decay to zero.440441442 The negative resistance cancels the positive resistance of the resonator, creating in effect a lossless resonator, in which spontaneous continuous oscillations occur at the resonator's resonant frequency.443444
Uses
Negative resistance oscillators are mainly used at high frequencies in the microwave range or above, since feedback oscillators function poorly at these frequencies.445446 Microwave diodes are used in low- to medium-power oscillators for applications such as radar speed guns, and local oscillators for satellite receivers. They are a widely used source of microwave energy, and virtually the only solid-state source of millimeter wave447 and terahertz energy448 Negative resistance microwave vacuum tubes such as magnetrons produce higher power outputs,449 in such applications as radar transmitters and microwave ovens. Lower frequency relaxation oscillators can be made with UJTs and gas-discharge lamps such as neon lamps.
The negative resistance oscillator model is not limited to one-port devices like diodes but can also be applied to feedback oscillator circuits with two port devices such as transistors and tubes.450451452453 In addition, in modern high frequency oscillators, transistors are increasingly used as one-port negative resistance devices like diodes. At microwave frequencies, transistors with certain loads applied to one port can become unstable due to internal feedback and show negative resistance at the other port.454455456 So high frequency transistor oscillators are designed by applying a reactive load to one port to give the transistor negative resistance, and connecting the other port across a resonator to make a negative resistance oscillator as described below.457458
Gunn diode oscillator
thumb|upright=1.3|Gunn diode oscillator load lines.
DCL: DC load line, which sets the Q point.
SSL: negative resistance during startup while amplitude is small. Since 
 
 
 
  poles are in RHP and amplitude of oscillations increases.
LSL: large-signal load line. When the current swing approaches the edges of the negative resistance region (green), the sine wave peaks are distorted ("clipped") and 
 
 
 
  decreases until it equals 
 
 
 
 . 
The common Gunn diode oscillator (circuit diagrams)459 illustrates how negative resistance oscillators work. The diode D has voltage controlled ("N" type) negative resistance and the voltage source 
 
 
 
  biases it into its negative resistance region where its differential resistance is 
 
 
 
 . The choke RFC prevents AC current from flowing through the bias source.460

 
  is the equivalent resistance due to damping and losses in the series tuned circuit 
 
 
 
 , plus any load resistance. Analyzing the AC circuit with Kirchhoff's Voltage Law gives a differential equation for 
 
 
 
 , the AC current461


 
  Solving this equation gives a solution of the form462


 
      where    
 
 
 
  This shows that the current through the circuit, 
 
 
 
 , varies with time about the DC Q point, 
 
 
 
 . When started from a nonzero initial current 
 
 
 
  the current oscillates sinusoidally at the resonant frequency ω of the tuned circuit, with amplitude either constant, increasing, or decreasing exponentially, depending on the value of α. Whether the circuit can sustain steady oscillations depends on the balance between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the positive and negative resistance in the circuit:463



 
 : (poles in left half plane) If the diode's negative resistance is less than the positive resistance of the tuned circuit, the damping is positive. Any oscillations in the circuit will lose energy as heat in the resistance 
 
 
 
  and die away exponentially to zero, as in an ordinary tuned circuit.464 So the circuit does not oscillate.


 
 : (poles on jω axis) If the positive and negative resistances are equal, the net resistance is zero, so the damping is zero. The diode adds just enough energy to compensate for energy lost in the tuned circuit and load, so oscillations in the circuit, once started, will continue at a constant amplitude.465 This is the condition during steady-state operation of the oscillator.


 
 : (poles in right half plane) If the negative resistance is greater than the positive resistance, damping is negative, so oscillations will grow exponentially in energy and amplitude.466 This is the condition during startup.

Practical oscillators are designed in region (3) above, with net negative resistance, to get oscillations started.467 A widely used rule of thumb is to make 
 
 
 
 .468469 When the power is turned on, electrical noise in the circuit provides a signal 
 
 
 
  to start spontaneous oscillations, which grow exponentially. However, the oscillations cannot grow forever; the nonlinearity of the diode eventually limits the amplitude.
At large amplitudes the circuit is nonlinear, so the linear analysis above does not strictly apply and differential resistance is undefined; but the circuit can be understood by considering 
 
 
 
  to be the "average" resistance over the cycle. As the amplitude of the sine wave exceeds the width of the negative resistance region and the voltage swing extends into regions of the curve with positive differential resistance, the average negative differential resistance 
 
 
 
  becomes smaller, and thus the total resistance 
 
 
 
  and the damping 
 
 
 
  becomes less negative and eventually turns positive. Therefore, the oscillations will stabilize at the amplitude at which the damping becomes zero, which is when 
 
 
 
 .470
Gunn diodes have negative resistance in the range −5 to −25 ohms.471 In oscillators where 
 
 
 
  is close to 
 
 
 
 ; just small enough to allow the oscillator to start, the voltage swing will be mostly limited to the linear portion of the I–V curve, the output waveform will be nearly sinusoidal and the frequency will be most stable. In circuits in which 
 
 
 
  is far below 
 
 
 
 , the swing extends further into the nonlinear part of the curve, the clipping distortion of the output sine wave is more severe,472 and the frequency will be increasingly dependent on the supply voltage.
Types of circuit
Negative resistance oscillator circuits can be divided into two types, which are used with the two types of negative differential resistance – voltage controlled (VCNR), and current controlled (CCNR)473474 

Negative resistance (voltage controlled) oscillator: Since VCNR ("N" type) devices require a low impedance bias and are stable for load impedances less than r,475 the ideal oscillator circuit for this device has the form shown at top right, with a voltage source Vbias to bias the device into its negative resistance region, and parallel resonant circuit load LC. The resonant circuit has high impedance only at its resonant frequency, so the circuit will be unstable and oscillate only at that frequency.

(Figure)
Negative resistance oscillator circuit CCNR.svg


Negative conductance (current controlled) oscillator: CCNR ("S" type) devices, in contrast, require a high impedance bias and are stable for load impedances greater than r.476 The ideal oscillator circuit is like that at bottom right, with a current source bias Ibias (which may consist of a voltage source in series with a large resistor) and series resonant circuit LC. The series LC circuit has low impedance only at its resonant frequency and so will only oscillate there.

Conditions for oscillation
Most oscillators are more complicated than the Gunn diode example, since both the active device and the load may have reactance (X) as well as resistance (R). Modern negative resistance oscillators are designed by a frequency domain technique due to K. Kurokawa.477478479 The circuit diagram is imagined to be divided by a "reference plane" (red) which separates the negative resistance part, the active device, from the positive resistance part, the resonant circuit and output load (right).480 The complex impedance of the negative resistance part 
 
 
 
  depends on frequency ω but is also nonlinear, in general declining with the amplitude of the AC oscillation current I; while the resonator part 
 
 
 
  is linear, depending only on frequency.481482483 The circuit equation is 
 
 
 
  so it will only oscillate (have nonzero I) at the frequency ω and amplitude I for which the total impedance 
 
 
 
  is zero.484 This means the magnitude of the negative and positive resistances must be equal, and the reactances must be conjugate485486487488 


 
     and    
 
 
 
  For steady-state oscillation the equal sign applies. During startup the inequality applies, because the circuit must have excess negative resistance for oscillations to start.489490491
Alternately, the condition for oscillation can be expressed using the reflection coefficient.492 The voltage waveform at the reference plane can be divided into a component V1 travelling toward the negative resistance device and a component V2 travelling in the opposite direction, toward the resonator part. The reflection coefficient of the active device 
 
 
 
  is greater than one, while that of the resonator part 
 
 
 
  is less than one. During operation the waves are reflected back and forth in a round trip so the circuit will oscillate only if493494495


 
  As above, the equality gives the condition for steady oscillation, while the inequality is required during startup to provide excess negative resistance. The above conditions are analogous to the Barkhausen criterion for feedback oscillators; they are necessary but not sufficient,496 so there are some circuits that satisfy the equations but do not oscillate. Kurokawa also derived more complicated sufficient conditions,497 which are often used instead.498499
Amplifiers
Negative differential resistance devices such as Gunn and IMPATT diodes are also used to make amplifiers, particularly at microwave frequencies, but not as commonly as oscillators.500 Because negative resistance devices have only one port (two terminals), unlike two-port devices such as transistors, the outgoing amplified signal has to leave the device by the same terminals as the incoming signal enters it.501502 Without some way of separating the two signals, a negative resistance amplifier is bilateral; it amplifies in both directions, so it suffers from sensitivity to load impedance and feedback problems.503 To separate the input and output signals, many negative resistance amplifiers use nonreciprocal devices such as isolators and directional couplers.504
Reflection amplifier
One widely used circuit is the reflection amplifier in which the separation is accomplished by a circulator.505506507508 A circulator is a nonreciprocal solid-state component with three ports (connectors) which transfers a signal applied to one port to the next in only one direction, port 1 to port 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 1. In the reflection amplifier diagram the input signal is applied to port 1, a biased VCNR negative resistance diode N is attached through a filter F to port 2, and the output circuit is attached to port 3. The input signal is passed from port 1 to the diode at port 2, but the outgoing "reflected" amplified signal from the diode is routed to port 3, so there is little coupling from output to input. The characteristic impedance 
 
 
 
  of the input and output transmission lines, usually 50Ω, is matched to the port impedance of the circulator. The purpose of the filter F is to present the correct impedance to the diode to set the gain. At radio frequencies NR diodes are not pure resistive loads and have reactance, so a second purpose of the filter is to cancel the diode reactance with a conjugate reactance to prevent standing waves.509510
The filter has only reactive components and so does not absorb any power itself, so power is passed between the diode and the ports without loss. The input signal power to the diode is


 
  The output power from the diode is


 
  So the power gain

 
  of the amplifier is the square of the reflection coefficient511512513









 
  is the negative resistance of the diode −r. Assuming the filter is matched to the diode so 
 
 
514 then the gain is


 
  The VCNR reflection amplifier above is stable for 
 
 
 
 .515 while a CCNR amplifier is stable for 
 
 
 
 . It can be seen that the reflection amplifier can have unlimited gain, approaching infinity as 
 
 
 
  approaches the point of oscillation at 
 
 
 
 .516 This is a characteristic of all NR amplifiers,517 contrasting with the behavior of two-port amplifiers, which generally have limited gain but are often unconditionally stable. In practice the gain is limited by the backward "leakage" coupling between circulator ports.
Masers and parametric amplifiers are extremely low noise NR amplifiers that are also implemented as reflection amplifiers; they are used in applications like radio telescopes.518
Switching circuits
Negative differential resistance devices are also used in switching circuits in which the device operates nonlinearly, changing abruptly from one state to another, with hysteresis.519 The advantage of using a negative resistance device is that a relaxation oscillator, flip-flop or memory cell can be built with a single active device,520 whereas the standard logic circuit for these functions, the Eccles-Jordan multivibrator, requires two active devices (transistors). Three switching circuits built with negative resistances are

Astable multivibrator – a circuit with two unstable states, in which the output periodically switches back and forth between the states. The time it remains in each state is determined by the time constant of an RC circuit. Therefore, it is a relaxation oscillator, and can produce square waves or triangle waves.
Monostable multivibrator – is a circuit with one unstable state and one stable state. When in its stable state a pulse is applied to the input, the output switches to its other state and remains in it for a period of time dependent on the time constant of the RC circuit, then switches back to the stable state. Thus the monostable can be used as a timer or delay element.
Bistable multivibrator or flip flop – is a circuit with two stable states. A pulse at the input switches the circuit to its other state. Therefore, bistables can be used as memory circuits, and digital counters.

Other applications
Neuronal models
Some instances of neurons display regions of negative slope conductances (RNSC) in voltage-clamp experiments.521 The negative resistance here is implied were one to consider the neuron a typical Hodgkin–Huxley style circuit model.
History
Negative resistance was first recognized during investigations of electric arcs, which were used for lighting during the 19th century.522 In 1881 Alfred Niaudet523 had observed that the voltage across arc electrodes decreased temporarily as the arc current increased, but many researchers thought this was a secondary effect due to temperature.524 The term "negative resistance" was applied by some to this effect, but the term was controversial because it was known that the resistance of a passive device could not be negative.525526527 Beginning in 1895 Hertha Ayrton, extending her husband William's research with a series of meticulous experiments measuring the I–V curve of arcs, established that arcs had negative resistance, igniting controversy.528529530 Frith and Rodgers in 1896531532 with the support of the Ayrtons533 introduced the concept of differential resistance, dv/di, and it was slowly accepted that arcs had negative differential resistance. In recognition of her research, Hertha Ayrton became the first woman voted for induction into the Institute of Electrical Engineers.534
Arc transmitters
George Francis Fitzgerald first realized in 1892 that if the damping resistance in a resonant circuit could be made zero or negative, it would produce continuous oscillations.535536 In the same year Elihu Thomson built a negative resistance oscillator by connecting an LC circuit to the electrodes of an arc,537538 perhaps the first example of an electronic oscillator. William Duddell, a student of Ayrton at London Central Technical College, brought Thomson's arc oscillator to public attention.539540541 Due to its negative resistance, the current through an arc was unstable, and arc lights would often produce hissing, humming, or even howling noises. In 1899, investigating this effect, Duddell connected an LC circuit across an arc and the negative resistance excited oscillations in the tuned circuit, producing a musical tone from the arc.542543544 To demonstrate his invention Duddell wired several tuned circuits to an arc and played a tune on it.545546 Duddell's "singing arc" oscillator was limited to audio frequencies.547 However, in 1903 Danish engineers Valdemar Poulsen and P. O. Pederson increased the frequency into the radio range by operating the arc in a hydrogen atmosphere in a magnetic field,548 inventing the Poulsen arc radio transmitter, which was widely used until the 1920s.549550
Vacuum tubes
By the early 20th century, although the physical causes of negative resistance were not understood, engineers knew it could generate oscillations and had begun to apply it.551 Heinrich Barkhausen in 1907 showed that oscillators must have negative resistance.552 Ernst Ruhmer and Adolf Pieper discovered that mercury vapor lamps could produce oscillations, and by 1912 AT&T; had used them to build amplifying repeaters for telephone lines.553
In 1918 Albert Hull at GE discovered that vacuum tubes could have negative resistance in parts of their operating ranges, due to a phenomenon called secondary emission.554555556 In a vacuum tube when electrons strike the plate electrode they can knock additional electrons out of the surface into the tube. This represents a current away from the plate, reducing the plate current.557 Under certain conditions increasing the plate voltage causes a decrease in plate current. By connecting an LC circuit to the tube Hull created an oscillator, the dynatron oscillator. Other negative resistance tube oscillators followed, such as the magnetron invented by Hull in 1920.558
The negative impedance converter originated from work by Marius Latour around 1920.559560 He was also one of the first to report negative capacitance and inductance.561 A decade later, vacuum tube NICs were developed as telephone line repeaters at Bell Labs by George Crisson and others,562563 which made transcontinental telephone service possible.564 Transistor NICs, pioneered by Linvill in 1953, initiated a great increase in interest in NICs and many new circuits and applications developed.565566
Solid state devices
Negative differential resistance in semiconductors was observed around 1909 in the first point-contact junction diodes, called cat's whisker detectors, by researchers such as William Henry Eccles567568 and G. W. Pickard.569570 They noticed that when junctions were biased with a DC voltage to improve their sensitivity as radio detectors, they would sometimes break into spontaneous oscillations.571 However the effect was not pursued.
The first person to exploit negative resistance diodes practically was Russian radio researcher Oleg Losev, who in 1922 discovered negative differential resistance in biased zincite (zinc oxide) point contact junctions.572573574575576 He used these to build solid-state amplifiers, oscillators, and amplifying and regenerative radio receivers, 25 years before the invention of the transistor.577578579580 Later he even built a superheterodyne receiver.581 However his achievements were overlooked because of the success of vacuum tube technology. After ten years he abandoned research into this technology (dubbed "Crystodyne" by Hugo Gernsback),582 and it was forgotten.583
The first widely used solid-state negative resistance device was the tunnel diode, invented in 1957 by Japanese physicist Leo Esaki.584585 Because they have lower parasitic capacitance than vacuum tubes due to their small junction size, diodes can function at higher frequencies, and tunnel diode oscillators proved able to produce power at microwave frequencies, above the range of ordinary vacuum tube oscillators. Its invention set off a search for other negative resistance semiconductor devices for use as microwave oscillators,586 resulting in the discovery of the IMPATT diode, Gunn diode, TRAPATT diode, and others. In 1969 Kurokawa derived conditions for stability in negative resistance circuits.587 Currently negative differential resistance diode oscillators are the most widely used sources of microwave energy,588 and many new negative resistance devices have been discovered in recent decades.589

 In this video Prof. Horowitz demonstrates that negative static resistance actually exists. He has a black box with two terminals, labelled "−10 kilohms" and shows with ordinary test equipment that it acts like a linear negative resistor (active resistor) with a resistance of −10 KΩ: a positive voltage across it causes a proportional negative current through it, and when connected in a voltage divider with an ordinary resistor the output of the divider is greater than the input, it can amplify. At the end he opens the box and shows it contains an op-amp negative impedance converter circuit and battery.↩

The terms "open-circuit stable" and "short-circuit stable" have become somewhat confused over the years, and are used in the opposite sense by some authors. The reason is that in linear circuits if the load line crosses the I-V curve of the NR device at one point, the circuit is stable, while in nonlinear switching circuits that operate by hysteresis the same condition causes the circuit to become unstable and oscillate as an astable multivibrator, and the bistable region is considered the "stable" one. This article uses the former "linear" definition, the earliest one, which is found in the Abraham, Bangert, Dorf, Golio, and Tellegen sources. The latter "switching circuit" definition is found in the Kumar and Taub sources.↩
