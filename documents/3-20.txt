   Well-founded relation      Well-founded relation   In mathematics , a binary relation , R , is well-founded (or wellfounded ) on a class  X if and only if every non- empty  subset  S⊆X has a minimal element ; that is, some element  m of any S is not related by sRm (for instance, " m is not smaller than") for the rest of the s ∈ S .      ∀  S  ⊆   X    (  S  ≠  ∅  →  ∃  m  ∈   S   ∀  s  ∈   S    (  s  ,  m  )   ∉  R  )      fragments  for-all  S   X   fragments  normal-(  S    normal-→   m   S  for-all  s   S   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-,  m  normal-)    R  normal-)     \forall S\subseteq X\ (S\neq\varnothing\to\exists m\in S\;\;\forall s\in S\;\,%
 (s,m)\notin R)   (Some authors include an extra condition that R is set-like , i.e., that the elements less than any given element form a set.)  Equivalently, assuming some choice , a relation is well-founded if and only if it contains no countable infinite descending chains : that is, there is no infinite sequence x 0 , x 1 , x 2 , ... of elements of X such that x n +1  R  x n for every natural number n .  In order theory , a partial order is called well-founded if the corresponding strict order is a well-founded relation. If the order is a total order then it is called a well-order .  In set theory , a set x is called a well-founded set if the set membership relation is well-founded on the transitive closure of x . The axiom of regularity , which is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory , asserts that all sets are well-founded.  A relation R is converse well-founded , upwards well-founded or Noetherian on X , if the converse relation  R −1 is well-founded on X . In this case R is also said to satisfy the ascending chain condition . In the context of rewriting systems, a Noetherian relation is also called terminating .  Induction and recursion  An important reason that well-founded relations are interesting is because a version of transfinite induction can be used on them: if ( X , R ) is a well-founded relation, P ( x ) is some property of elements of X , and we want to show that   P ( x ) holds for all elements x of X ,   it suffices to show that:   If x is an element of X and P ( y ) is true for all y such that y R x , then P ( x ) must also be true.   That is,      ∀  x  ∈   X    [   (  ∀  y  ∈   X    (   y    R   x  →  P   (  y  )   )   )   →  P   (  x  )   ]   →  ∀  x  ∈   X   P   (  x  )   .     fragments  for-all  x   X   fragments  normal-[   fragments  normal-(  for-all  y   X   fragments  normal-(  y  R  x  normal-→  P   fragments  normal-(  y  normal-)   normal-)   normal-)   normal-→  P   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-]   normal-→  for-all  x   X  P   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-.    \forall x\in X\,[(\forall y\in X\,(y\,R\,x\to P(y)))\to P(x)]\to\forall x\in X%
 \,P(x).   Well-founded induction is sometimes called Noetherian induction, 1 after Emmy Noether .  On par with induction, well-founded relations also support construction of objects by transfinite recursion . Let ( X , R ) be a set-like well-founded relation and F a function that assigns an object F ( x , g ) to each pair of an element x ∈ X and a function g on the initial segment { y : y  R  x } of X . Then there is a unique function G such that for every x ∈ X ,       G   (  x  )    =   F   (  x  ,    G  |    {  y  :    y    R   x   }    )          G  x     F   x   evaluated-at  G   conditional-set  y    y  R  x         G(x)=F(x,G|_{\{y:y\,R\,x\}})   That is, if we want to construct a function G on X , we may define G ( x ) using the values of G ( y ) for y R x .  As an example, consider the well-founded relation ( N , S ), where N is the set of all natural numbers , and S is the graph of the successor function x → x + 1. Then induction on S is the usual mathematical induction , and recursion on S gives primitive recursion . If we consider the order relation ( N , 1, n 2 ) 1, m 2 ) if and only if n 1 1 and n 2 2.   the set of all regular expressions over a fixed alphabet, with the order defined by s < t if and only if s is a proper subexpression of t .  any class whose elements are sets, with the relation   ∈     \in   ("is an element of"). This is the axiom of regularity .  the nodes of any finite directed acyclic graph , with the relation R defined such that a R b if and only if there is an edge from a to b .   Examples of relations that are not well-founded include:   the negative integers {-1, -2, -3, …}, with the usual order, since any unbounded subset has no least element.  The set of strings over a finite alphabet with more than one element, under the usual ( lexicographic ) order, since the sequence "B" > "AB" > "AAB" > "AAAB" > … is an infinite descending chain. This relation fails to be well-founded even though the entire set has a minimum element, namely the empty string.  the rational numbers (or reals ) under the standard ordering, since, for example, the set of positive rationals (or reals) lacks a minimum.   Other properties  If ( X , 1 \geq 1 \geq 1 \geq \cdots. To avoid these trivial descending sequences, when working with a reflexive relation R it is common to use (perhaps implicitly) the alternate relation R′ defined such that a  R′  b if and only if a  R  b and a ≠ b . In the context of the natural numbers, this means that the relation     Bourbaki, N. (1972) Elements of mathematics. Commutative algebra , Addison-Wesley. ↩
