Cofibration

In mathematics, in particular homotopy theory, a continuous mapping


 
 ,
where A and X are topological spaces, is a cofibration if it satisfies the homotopy extension property with respect to all spaces Y. The name is because the dual condition, the homotopy lifting property, defines fibrations. For a more general notion of cofibration see the article about model categories.
Basic theorems

For Hausdorff spaces a cofibration is a closed inclusion (injective with closed image); for suitable spaces, a converse holds
Every map can be replaced by a cofibration via the mapping cylinder construction
There is a cofibration (A, X), if and only if there is a retraction from








to

since this is the pushout and thus induces maps to every space sensible in the diagram.
Examples

Cofibrations are preserved under push-outs and composition, as one sees from the definition via diagram-chasing.
A frequently used fact is that a cellular inclusion is a cofibration (so, for instance, if 
 
 
 
 
  is a CW pair, then 
 
 
 
  is a cofibration). This follows from the previous fact since 
 
 
 
  is a cofibration for every 
 
 
 
 .
