   Cofibration      Cofibration   In mathematics , in particular homotopy theory , a continuous mapping      i  :   A  →  X      normal-:  i   normal-→  A  X     i\colon A\to X   ,  where A and X are topological spaces , is a cofibration if it satisfies the homotopy extension property with respect to all spaces Y . The name is because the dual condition, the homotopy lifting property , defines fibrations . For a more general notion of cofibration see the article about model categories .  Basic theorems   For Hausdorff spaces a cofibration is a closed inclusion (injective with closed image); for suitable spaces, a converse holds  Every map can be replaced by a cofibration via the mapping cylinder construction  There is a cofibration ( A , X ), if and only if there is a retraction from         X  ×  I      X  I    X\times I       to      (   A  ×  I   )   ∪   (   X  ×   {  0  }    )         A  I     X   0      (A\times I)\cup(X\times\{0\})   ,    since this is the pushout and thus induces maps to every space sensible in the diagram.  Examples   Cofibrations are preserved under push-outs and composition, as one sees from the definition via diagram-chasing.  A frequently used fact is that a cellular inclusion is a cofibration (so, for instance, if    (  X  ,  A  )     X  A    (X,A)   is a CW pair, then    A  →  X     normal-→  A  X    A\to X   is a cofibration). This follows from the previous fact since     S   n  -  1    →   D  n      normal-→   superscript  S    n  1     superscript  D  n     S^{n-1}\to D^{n}   is a cofibration for every   n   n   n   .
