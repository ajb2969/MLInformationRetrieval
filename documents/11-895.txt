   D-tryptophan N-malonyltransferase      D-tryptophan N-malonyltransferase   In enzymology , a D-tryptophan N-malonyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   malonyl-CoA + D-tryptophan   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N 2 -malonyl-D-tryptophan   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and D-tryptophan , whereas its two products are CoA and N2-malonyl-D-tryptophan .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:D-tryptophan N-malonyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
