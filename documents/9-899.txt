   Cophenetic correlation      Cophenetic correlation  In [[statistics]], and especially in [[biostatistics]], '''cophenetic correlation''' Sokal, R. R. and F. J. Rohlf. 1962. The comparison of den drograms by objective methods. Taxon, 11:33-40 (more precisely, the cophenetic correlation coefficient ) is a measure of how faithfully a dendrogram preserves the pairwise distances between the original unmodeled data points. Although it has been most widely applied in the field of biostatistics (typically to assess cluster-based models of DNA sequences, or other taxonomic models), it can also be used in other fields of inquiry where raw data tend to occur in clumps, or clusters. 1 This coefficient has also been proposed for use as a test for nested clusters. 2  Calculating the cophenetic correlation coefficient  Suppose that the original data { X i } have been modeled using a cluster method to produce a dendrogram { T i }; that is, a simplified model in which data that are "close" have been grouped into a hierarchical tree. Define the following distance measures.   x ( i , j ) = | X i − X j |, the ordinary Euclidean distance between the i th and j th observations.  t ( i , j ) = the dendrogrammatic distance between the model points T i and T j . This distance is the height of the node at which these two points are first joined together.   Then, letting    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   be the average of the x ( i , j ), and letting    t  ¯     normal-¯  t    \bar{t}   be the average of the t ( i , j ), the cophenetic correlation coefficient c is given by 3  $$c = \frac {\sum_{i ==See also==
