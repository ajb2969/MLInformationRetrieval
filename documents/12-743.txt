   Constant-energy surface      Constant-energy surface   In a Brillouin zone , the constant-energy surface represents the loci of all the    k  →     normal-→  k    \vec{k}   -points (that is, all the crystal momentum values) that have the same energy. Fermi surface is a special constant-energy surface that separates the unfilled orbitals from the filled ones at zero kelvin.  "  Category:Condensed matter physics
