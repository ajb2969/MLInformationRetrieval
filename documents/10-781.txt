Isobutyraldoxime O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, an isobutyraldoxime O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 2-methylpropanal oxime 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2-methylpropanal O-methyloxime
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 2-methylpropanal oxime, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 2-methylpropanal O-methyloxime.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:2-methylpropanal-oxime O-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include aldoxime methyltransferase, S-adenosylmethionine:aldoxime O-methyltransferase, and aldoxime O-methyltransferase.
