Diacylglycerol diphosphate phosphatase

Diacylglycerol diphosphate phosphatase (, DGPP phosphatase, DGPP phosphohydrolase, DPP1, DPPL1, DPPL2, PAP2, pyrophosphate phosphatase) is an enzyme with system name 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate phosphohydrolase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + phosphate


The phosphatase activity of this enzyme is Mg2+-independent.
