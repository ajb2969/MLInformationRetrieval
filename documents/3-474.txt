   Branching process      Branching process   In probability theory , a branching process is a Markov process that models a population in which each individual in generation n produces some random number of individuals in generation n + 1, according, in the simplest case, to a fixed probability distribution that does not vary from individual to individual. 1 Branching processes are used to model reproduction; for example, the individuals might correspond to bacteria, each of which generates 0, 1, or 2 offspring with some probability in a single time unit. Branching processes can also be used to model other systems with similar dynamics, e.g., the spread of surnames in genealogy or the propagation of neutrons in a nuclear reactor .  A central question in the theory of branching processes is the probability of ultimate extinction , where no individuals exist after some finite number of generations. It is not hard to show that, starting with one individual in generation zero, the expected size of generation n equals μ n where μ is the expected number of children of each individual. If μ  1, then the probability of ultimate extinction is less than 1 (but not necessarily zero; consider a process where each individual either dies without issue or has 100 children with equal probability). If μ = 1, then ultimate extinction occurs with probability 1 unless each individual always has exactly one child.  In theoretical ecology , the parameter μ of a branching process is called the basic reproductive rate .  Mathematical formulation  The most common formulation of a branching process is that of the Galton–Watson process . Let Z n denote the state in period n (often interpreted as the size of generation n ), and let X n,i be a random variable denoting the number of direct successors of member i in period n , where X n,i are independent and identically distributed random variables over all n ∈ 0, 1, 2, ...} and i ∈ {1, ..., Z n }. Then the recurrence equation is       Z   n  +  1    =    ∑   i  =  1    Z  n     X   n  ,  i          subscript  Z    n  1      superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  Z  n     subscript  X   n  i       Z_{n+1}=\sum_{i=1}^{Z_{n}}X_{n,i}     with Z 0 = 1. Alternatively, one can formulate a branching process as a random walk . Let S i denote the state in period i , and let X i be a random variable that is iid over all i . Then the recurrence equation is       S   i  +  1    =     S  i   +   X   i  +  1     -  1   =     ∑   j  =  1    i  +  1     X  j    -  i          subscript  S    i  1         subscript  S  i    subscript  X    i  1     1            superscript   subscript     j  1      i  1     subscript  X  j    i      S_{i+1}=S_{i}+X_{i+1}-1=\sum_{j=1}^{i+1}X_{j}-i     with S 0 = 1. To gain some intuition for this formulation, one can imagine a walk where the goal is to visit every node, but every time a previously unvisited node is visited, additional nodes are revealed that must also be visited. Let S i represent the number of revealed but unvisited nodes in period i , and let X i represent the number of new nodes that are revealed when node i is visited. Then in each period, the number of revealed but unvisited nodes equals the number of such nodes in the previous period, plus the new nodes that are revealed when visiting a node, minus the node that is visited. The process ends once all revealed nodes have been visited.  Extinction problem  The ultimate extinction probability is given by        lim   n  →  ∞     Pr   (    Z  n   =  0   )     .      subscript    normal-→  n      Pr     subscript  Z  n   0      \lim_{n\to\infty}\Pr(Z_{n}=0).     For any nontrivial cases (trivial cases are ones in which the probability of having no offspring is zero for every member of the population - in such cases the probability of ultimate extinction is 0), the probability of ultimate extinction equals one if μ ≤ 1 and strictly less than one if μ > 1.  The process can be analyzed using the method of probability generating function . Let p 0 , p 1 , p 2 , ... are the probabilities of producing 0, 1, 2, ... offspring by each individual in each generation. Let d m be the extinction probability by the mth generation. Obviously, d 0 = 0. Since the probabilities for all paths that lead to 0 by the m -th generation must be added up, the extinction probability is nondecreasing in generations. That is,      0  =   d  0   ≤   d  1   ≤   d  2   ≤  ⋯  ≤  1.        0   subscript  d  0         subscript  d  1         subscript  d  2        normal-⋯       1.     0=d_{0}\leq d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq\cdots\leq 1.     Therefore, d m converges to a limit d, and d is the ultimate extinction probability. If there are j offspring in the first generation, then to die out by the mth generation, each of these lines must die out in m-1 generations. Since they proceed independently, the probability is ( d m−1 ) j . Thus,        d  m   =    p  0   +    p  1    d   m  -  1     +    p  2     (   d   m  -  1    )   2    +    p  3     (   d   m  -  1    )   3    +  ⋯    .       subscript  d  m      subscript  p  0      subscript  p  1    subscript  d    m  1        subscript  p  2    superscript   subscript  d    m  1    2       subscript  p  3    superscript   subscript  d    m  1    3    normal-⋯     d_{m}=p_{0}+p_{1}d_{m-1}+p_{2}(d_{m-1})^{2}+p_{3}(d_{m-1})^{3}+\cdots.\,     The right-hand side of the equation is probability generating function. Let h ( z ) be the ordinary generating function for p i :        h   (  z  )    =    p  0   +    p  1   z   +    p  2    z  2    +  ⋯    .        h  z      subscript  p  0      subscript  p  1   z      subscript  p  2    superscript  z  2    normal-⋯     h(z)=p_{0}+p_{1}z+p_{2}z^{2}+\cdots.\,     Using the generating function, the previous equation becomes        d  m   =   h   (   d   m  -  1    )     .       subscript  d  m     h   subscript  d    m  1       d_{m}=h(d_{m-1}).\,     Since d m → d , d can be found by solving       d  =   h   (  d  )     .      d    h  d     d=h(d).\,     This is also equivalent to finding the intersection point(s) of lines y = z and y = h ( z ) for z ≥ 0. y = z is a straight line. y = h ( z ) is an increasing (since      h  ′    (  z  )    =    p  1   +   2   p  2   z   +   3   p  3    z  2    +  ⋯   ≥  0           superscript  h  normal-′   z      subscript  p  1     2   subscript  p  2   z     3   subscript  p  3    superscript  z  2    normal-⋯        0     h^{\prime}(z)=p_{1}+2p_{2}z+3p_{3}z^{2}+\cdots\geq 0   ) and convex (since      h  ′′    (  z  )    =    2   p  2    +   6   p  3   z   +   12   p  4    z  2    +  ⋯   ≥  0           superscript  h  ′′   z       2   subscript  p  2      6   subscript  p  3   z     12   subscript  p  4    superscript  z  2    normal-⋯        0     h^{\prime\prime}(z)=2p_{2}+6p_{3}z+12p_{4}z^{2}+\cdots\geq 0   ) function. There are at most two intersection points. Since (1,1) is always an intersect point for the two functions, there only exist three cases:  Case 1 has another intersect point at z 1.(See the black curve in the graph)  In case 1, the ultimate extinction probability is strictly less than one. For case 2 and 3, the ultimate extinction probability equals to one.  By observing that h′ (1) = p 1 + 2 p 2 + 3 p 3 + ... = μ is exactly the expected number of offspring a parent could produce, it can be concluded that for a branching process with generating function h ( z ) for the number of offspring of a given parent, if the mean number of offspring produced by a single parent is less than or equal to one, then the ultimate extinction probability is one. If the mean number of offspring produced by a single parent is greater than one, then the ultimate extinction probability is strictly less than one.  Example of extinction problem  Consider a parent can produce at most two offspring and the probabilities for the number produced are p 0 = 0.1, p 1 = 0.6, and p 2 = 0.3. The extinction probability in each generation is        d  m   =    p  0   +    p  1    d   m  -  1     +    p  2     (   d   m  -  1    )   2      .       subscript  d  m      subscript  p  0      subscript  p  1    subscript  d    m  1        subscript  p  2    superscript   subscript  d    m  1    2       d_{m}=p_{0}+p_{1}d_{m-1}+p_{2}(d_{m-1})^{2}.\,     with d 0 = 0. Here, the extinction probability is calculated from generation 1 to generation 20. The result is shown in the table.  For the ultimate extinction probability, we need to find d which satisfies d = p 0 + p 1 d + p 2 d 2 . In this example, d = 1/3. This is exactly what the probabilities in the table converges to.
