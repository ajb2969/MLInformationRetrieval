Lyapunov equation

In control theory, the discrete Lyapunov equation is of the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a Hermitian matrix and 
 
 
 
  is the conjugate transpose of 
 
 
 
 . The continuous Lyapunov equation is of form


 
 .
The Lyapunov equation occurs in many branches of control theory, such as stability analysis and optimal control. This and related equations are named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov.
Application to stability
In the following theorems 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are symmetric. The notation 
 
 
 
  means that the matrix 
 
 
 
  is positive definite.
Theorem (continuous time version). Given any 
 
 
 
 , there exists a unique 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  if and only if the linear system 
 
 
 
  is globally asymptotically stable. The quadratic function 
 
 
 
  is a Lyapunov function that can be used to verify stability.
Theorem (discrete time version). Given any 
 
 
 
 , there exists a unique 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  if and only if the linear system 
 
 
 
  is globally asymptotically stable. As before, 
 
 
 
  is a Lyapunov function.
Computational aspects of solution
Specialized software is available for solving Lyapunov equations. For the discrete case, the Schur method of Kitagawa is often used.1 For the continuous Lyapunov equation the method of Bartels and Stewart can be used.2
Analytic Solution
Defining the 
 
 
 
  operator as stacking the columns of a matrix 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as the Kronecker product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the continuous time and discrete time Lyapunov equations can be expressed as solutions of a matrix equation. Furthermore, if the matrix 
 
 
 
  is stable, the solution can also be expressed as an integral (continuous time case) or as an infinite sum (discrete time case).
Discrete time
Using the result that 
 
 
 
 , one has


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a conformable identity matrix.3 One may then solve for 
 
 
 
  by inverting or solving the linear equations. To get 
 
 
 
 , one must just reshape 
 
 
 
  appropriately.
Moreover, if 
 
 
 
  is stable, the solution 
 
 
 
  can also be written as


 
 .
Continuous time
Using again the Kronecker product notation and the vectorization operator, one has the matrix equation


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the matrix obtained by complex conjugating the entries of 
 
 
 
 .
Similar to the discrete-time case, if 
 
 
 
  is stable, the solution 
 
 
 
  can also be written as


 
 .
