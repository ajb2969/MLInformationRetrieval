   Lyapunov equation      Lyapunov equation   In control theory , the discrete Lyapunov equation is of the form         A  X   A  H    -  X   +  Q   =  0            A  X   superscript  A  H    X   Q   0    AXA^{H}-X+Q=0   where   Q   Q   Q   is a Hermitian matrix and    A  H     superscript  A  H    A^{H}   is the conjugate transpose of   A   A   A   . The continuous Lyapunov equation is of form        A  X   +   X   A  H    +  Q   =  0          A  X     X   superscript  A  H    Q   0    AX+XA^{H}+Q=0   .  The Lyapunov equation occurs in many branches of control theory, such as stability analysis and optimal control . This and related equations are named after the Russian mathematician Aleksandr Lyapunov .  Application to stability  In the following theorems     A  ,  P  ,  Q   ∈   ℝ   n  ×  n         A  P  Q    superscript  ℝ    n  n      A,P,Q\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}   , and   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   are symmetric. The notation    P  >  0      P  0    P>0   means that the matrix   P   P   P   is positive definite .  Theorem (continuous time version). Given any    Q  >  0      Q  0    Q>0   , there exists a unique    P  >  0      P  0    P>0   satisfying       A  T   P   +   P  A   +  Q   =  0           superscript  A  T   P     P  A   Q   0    A^{T}P+PA+Q=0   if and only if the linear system     x  ˙   =   A  x        normal-˙  x     A  x     \dot{x}=Ax   is globally asymptotically stable. The quadratic function     V   (  z  )    =    z  T   P  z         V  z      superscript  z  T   P  z     V(z)=z^{T}Pz   is a Lyapunov function that can be used to verify stability.  Theorem (discrete time version). Given any    Q  >  0      Q  0    Q>0   , there exists a unique    P  >  0      P  0    P>0   satisfying        A  T   P  A   -  P   +  Q   =  0             superscript  A  T   P  A   P   Q   0    A^{T}PA-P+Q=0   if and only if the linear system     x   (   t  +  1   )    =   A  x   (  t  )          x    t  1      A  x  t     x(t+1)=Ax(t)   is globally asymptotically stable. As before,     z  T   P  z       superscript  z  T   P  z    z^{T}Pz   is a Lyapunov function.  Computational aspects of solution  Specialized software is available for solving Lyapunov equations. For the discrete case, the Schur method of Kitagawa is often used. 1 For the continuous Lyapunov equation the method of Bartels and Stewart can be used. 2  Analytic Solution  Defining the    vec   (  A  )      vec  A    \operatorname{vec}(A)   operator as stacking the columns of a matrix   A   A   A   and    A  ⊗  B     tensor-product  A  B    A\otimes B   as the Kronecker product of   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   , the continuous time and discrete time Lyapunov equations can be expressed as solutions of a matrix equation. Furthermore, if the matrix   A   A   A   is stable, the solution can also be expressed as an integral (continuous time case) or as an infinite sum (discrete time case).  Discrete time  Using the result that     vec   (   A  B  C   )    =    (    C  T   ⊗  A   )    vec   (  B  )          vec    A  B  C       tensor-product   superscript  C  T   A    vec  B      \operatorname{vec}(ABC)=(C^{T}\otimes A)\operatorname{vec}(B)   , one has        (   I  -   A  ⊗  A    )    vec   (  X  )     =   vec   (  Q  )            I   tensor-product  A  A     vec  X     vec  Q     (I-A\otimes A)\operatorname{vec}(X)=\operatorname{vec}(Q)   where   I   I   I   is a conformable identity matrix. 3 One may then solve for    vec   (  X  )      vec  X    \operatorname{vec}(X)   by inverting or solving the linear equations. To get   X   X   X   , one must just reshape    vec   (  X  )      vec  X    \operatorname{vec}(X)   appropriately.  Moreover, if   A   A   A   is stable, the solution   X   X   X   can also be written as      X  =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     A  k   Q    (   A  H   )   k         X    superscript   subscript     k  0         superscript  A  k   Q   superscript   superscript  A  H   k       X=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}A^{k}Q(A^{H})^{k}   .  Continuous time  Using again the Kronecker product notation and the vectorization operator, one has the matrix equation         (     I  n   ⊗  A   +    A  ¯   ⊗   I  n     )    vec  X    =   -   vec  Q     ,           tensor-product   subscript  I  n   A    tensor-product   normal-¯  A    subscript  I  n      vec  X       vec  Q      (I_{n}\otimes A+\bar{A}\otimes I_{n})\operatorname{vec}X=-\operatorname{vec}Q,   where    A  ¯     normal-¯  A    \bar{A}   denotes the matrix obtained by complex conjugating the entries of   A   A   A   .  Similar to the discrete-time case, if   A   A   A   is stable, the solution   X   X   X   can also be written as      X  =    ∫  0  ∞     e   A  τ    Q   e    A  H   τ    d  τ        X    superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    A  τ    Q   superscript  e     superscript  A  H   τ    d  τ      X=\int\limits_{0}^{\infty}e^{A\tau}Qe^{A^{H}\tau}d\tau   .
