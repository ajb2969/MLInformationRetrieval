Deacetyl-(citrate-(pro-3S)-lyase) S-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a deacetyl-[citrate-(pro-3S)-lyase] S-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-acetylphosphopantetheine + deacetyl-[citrate-oxaloacetate-lyase((pro-3S)-CH2COO-->acetate)] 
 
 
 
  phosphopantetheine + [citrate-oxaloacetate-lyase((pro-3S)-CH2COO-->acetate)]
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-acetylphosphopantetheine and deacetyl-[citrate-oxaloacetate-lyase((pro-3S)-CH2COO-->acetate)], whereas its two products are phosphopantetheine and citrate-oxaloacetate-lyase((pro-3S)-CH2COO-->acetate).
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-acetylphosphopantetheine:deacetyl-[citrate-oxaloacetate-lyase((pro -3S)-CH2COO-->acetate)] S-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include S-acetyl phosphopantetheine:deacetyl citrate lyase, S-acetyltransferase, and deacetyl-[citrate-(pro-3S)-lyase] acetyltransferase.
