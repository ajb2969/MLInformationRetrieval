   Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra      Adjoint representation of a Lie algebra   In mathematics , the adjoint endomorphism or adjoint action is a homomorphism of Lie algebras that plays a fundamental role in the development of the theory of Lie algebras .  Given an element   x   x   x   of a Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , one defines the adjoint action of   x   x   x   on   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   as the map       ad  x   :    𝔤  →   𝔤  with       ad  x    (  y  )    =   [  x  ,  y  ]        normal-:   subscript  ad  x    formulae-sequence   normal-→  𝔤   𝔤  with        subscript  ad  x   y    x  y       \operatorname{ad}_{x}:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}\qquad\text{with}\qquad%
 \operatorname{ad}_{x}(y)=[x,y]   for all   y   y   y   in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  The concept generates the adjoint representation of a Lie group  Ad . In fact, ad is the differential of Ad at the identity element of the group.  Adjoint representation  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a Lie algebra over a field   k   k   k   . Then the linear mapping      ad  :   𝔤  →   End   (  𝔤  )        normal-:  ad   normal-→  𝔤   End  𝔤      \operatorname{ad}:\mathfrak{g}\to\operatorname{End}(\mathfrak{g})   given by is a representation of a Lie algebra and is called the adjoint representation of the algebra. (Its image actually lies in Der    (  𝔤  )    𝔤   (\mathfrak{g})   . See below.)  Within End    (  𝔤  )    𝔤   (\mathfrak{g})   , the Lie bracket is, by definition, given by the commutator of the two operators:       [   ad  x   ,   ad  y   ]   =     ad  x   ∘   ad  y    -    ad  y   ∘   ad  x           subscript  ad  x    subscript  ad  y         subscript  ad  x    subscript  ad  y       subscript  ad  y    subscript  ad  x       [\operatorname{ad}_{x},\operatorname{ad}_{y}]=\operatorname{ad}_{x}\circ%
 \operatorname{ad}_{y}-\operatorname{ad}_{y}\circ\operatorname{ad}_{x}   where ○ denotes composition of linear maps.  If   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is finite-dimensional, then End    (  𝔤  )    𝔤   (\mathfrak{g})   is isomorphic to    𝔤  𝔩   (  𝔤  )       𝔤  𝔩  𝔤    \mathfrak{gl}(\mathfrak{g})   , the Lie algebra of the general linear group over the vector space   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and if a basis for it is chosen, the composition corresponds to matrix multiplication .  Using the above definition of the Lie bracket, the Jacobi identity        [  x  ,   [  y  ,  z  ]   ]   +   [  y  ,   [  z  ,  x  ]   ]   +   [  z  ,   [  x  ,  y  ]   ]    =  0         x   y  z     y   z  x     z   x  y     0    [x,[y,z]]+[y,[z,x]]+[z,[x,y]]=0   takes the form        (   [   ad  x   ,   ad  y   ]   )    (  z  )    =    (   ad   [  x  ,  y  ]    )    (  z  )            subscript  ad  x    subscript  ad  y    z      subscript  ad   x  y    z     \left([\operatorname{ad}_{x},\operatorname{ad}_{y}]\right)(z)=\left(%
 \operatorname{ad}_{[x,y]}\right)(z)   where   x   x   x   ,   y   y   y   , and   z   z   z   are arbitrary elements of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  This last identity says that ad really is a Lie algebra homomorphism; i.e., a linear mapping that takes brackets to brackets.  In a more module-theoretic language, the construction simply says that   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is a module over itself.  The kernel of ad is, by definition, the center of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . Next, we consider the image of ad . Recall that a derivation on a Lie algebra is a linear map     δ  :   𝔤  →  𝔤      normal-:  δ   normal-→  𝔤  𝔤     \delta:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow\mathfrak{g}   that obeys the Leibniz' law , that is,       δ   (   [  x  ,  y  ]   )    =    [   δ   (  x  )    ,  y  ]   +   [  x  ,   δ   (  y  )    ]          δ   x  y         δ  x   y    x    δ  y       \delta([x,y])=[\delta(x),y]+[x,\delta(y)]   for all   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   in the algebra.  That ad x is a derivation is a consequence of the Jacobi identity. This implies that the image of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   under ad is a subalgebra of Der    (  𝔤  )    𝔤   (\mathfrak{g})   , the space of all derivations of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  Structure constants  The explicit matrix elements of the adjoint representation are given by the structure constants of the algebra. That is, let {e i } be a set of basis vectors for the algebra, with        [   e  i   ,   e  j   ]   =    ∑  k     c    i  j   k     e  k      .        superscript  e  i    superscript  e  j      subscript   k      subscript   superscript  c    i  j    k    superscript  e  k       [e^{i},e^{j}]=\sum_{k}{c^{ij}}_{k}e^{k}.   Then the matrix elements for ad e i are given by         [   ad   e  i    ]   k    j   =    c    i  j   k      .       superscript   subscript   delimited-[]   subscript  ad   superscript  e  i     k   j    subscript   superscript  c    i  j    k     {\left[\operatorname{ad}_{e^{i}}\right]_{k}}^{j}={c^{ij}}_{k}~{}.     Thus, for example, the adjoint representation of su(2) is the defining rep of so(3) .  Relation to Ad  Ad and ad are related through the exponential map : crudely, Ad = exp ad, where Ad is the adjoint representation for a Lie group .  To be more precise, let   G   G   G   be a Lie group, and let    Ψ  :   G  →  A  u  t   (  G  )       normal-:  normal-Ψ    G  normal-→  A  u  t  G     Ψ:G→Aut(G)   be the mapping , with given by the inner automorphism         Ψ  g    (  h  )    =   g  h    g   -  1       .         subscript  normal-Ψ  g   h     g  h   superscript  g    1       \Psi_{g}(h)=ghg^{-1}~{}.   It is an example of a Lie group map. Define to be the derivative of at the origin:        Ad  g   =    (   d   Ψ  g    )   e    :     T  e   G   →    T  e   G       normal-:     subscript  Ad  g    subscript    d   subscript  normal-Ψ  g    e     normal-→     subscript  T  e   G      subscript  T  e   G      \operatorname{Ad}_{g}=(d\Psi_{g})_{e}:T_{e}G\rightarrow T_{e}G   where   d   d   d   is the differential and is the tangent space at the origin   e   e   e   (   e   e   e   being the identity element of the group   G   G   G   ).  The Lie algebra of   G   G   G   is   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   = . Since Ad g ∈ Aut    (  𝔤  )    𝔤   (\mathfrak{g})   , is a map from   G   G   G   to which will have a derivative from to (the Lie algebra of    A  u  t   (  V  )       A  u  t  V    Aut(V)   being    E  n  d   (  V  )       E  n  d  V    End(V)   ).  Then we have        ad  =   d    (  Ad  )   e     :     T  e   G   →   End   (    T  e   G   )      .     normal-:    ad    d   subscript  Ad  e      normal-→     subscript  T  e   G    End     subscript  T  e   G       \operatorname{ad}=d(\operatorname{Ad})_{e}:T_{e}G\rightarrow\operatorname{End}%
 (T_{e}G).     The use of upper-case/lower-case notation is used extensively in the literature. Thus, for example, a vector   x   x   x   in the algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   generates a vector field    X   X   X   in the group   G   G   G   . Similarly, the adjoint map [ x , y ]}} of vectors in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is homomorphic to the Lie derivative  [ X , Y ]}} of vector fields on the group   G   G   G   considered as a manifold .
