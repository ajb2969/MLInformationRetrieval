Orbifold notation

In geometry, orbifold notation (or orbifold signature) is a system, invented by William Thurston and popularized by the mathematician John Conway, for representing types of symmetry groups in two-dimensional spaces of constant curvature. The advantage of the notation is that it describes these groups in a way which indicates many of the groups' properties: in particular, it describes the orbifold obtained by taking the quotient of Euclidean space by the group under consideration.
Groups representable in this notation include the point groups on the sphere (
 
 
 
 ), the frieze groups and wallpaper groups of the Euclidean plane (
 
 
 
 ), and their analogues on the hyperbolic plane (
 
 
 
 ).
Definition of the notation
The following types of Euclidean transformation can occur in a group described by orbifold notation:

reflection through a line (or plane)
translation by a vector
rotation of finite order around a point
infinite rotation around a line in 3-space
glide-reflection, i.e. reflection followed by translation.

All translations which occur are assumed to form a discrete subgroup of the group symmetries being described.
Each group is denoted in orbifold notation by a finite string made up from the following symbols:

positive integers


the infinity symbol, 
 
 

the asterisk, *
the symbol o (a solid circle in older documents), which is called a wonder and also a handle because it topologically represents a torus (1-handle) closed surface. Patterns repeat by two translation.
the symbol 
 
 
 
  (an open circle in older documents), which is called a miracle and represents a topological crosscap where a pattern repeats as a mirror image without crossing a mirror line.

A string written in boldface represents a group of symmetries of Euclidean 3-space. A string not written in boldface represents a group of symmetries of the Euclidean plane, which is assumed to contain two independent translations.
Each symbol corresponds to a distinct transformation:

an integer n to the left of an asterisk indicates a rotation of order n around a gyration point
an integer n to the right of an asterisk indicates a transformation of order 2n which rotates around a kaleidoscopic point and reflects through a line (or plane)
an 
 
 
 
  indicates a glide reflection
the symbol 
 
 
 
  indicates infinite rotational symmetry around a line; it can only occur for bold face groups. By abuse of language, we might say that such a group is a subgroup of symmetries of the Euclidean plane with only one independent translation. The frieze groups occur in this way.
the exceptional symbol o indicates that there are precisely two linearly independent translations.

Good orbifolds
An orbifold symbol is called good if it is not one of the following: p, pq, *p, *pq, for p,q>=2, and p≠q.
Chirality and achirality
An object is chiral if its symmetry group contains no reflections; otherwise it is called achiral. The corresponding orbifold is orientable in the chiral case and non-orientable otherwise.
The Euler characteristic and the order
The Euler characteristic of an orbifold can be read from its Conway symbol, as follows. Each feature has a value:

n without or before an asterisk counts as 
 
 



n after an asterisk counts as 
 
 



asterisk and 
 
 
 
  count as 1


o counts as 2.

Subtracting the sum of these values from 2 gives the Euler characteristic.
If the sum of the feature values is 2, the order is infinite, i.e., the notation represents a wallpaper group or a frieze group. Indeed, Conway's "Magic Theorem" indicates that the 17 wallpaper groups are exactly those with the sum of the feature values equal to 2. Otherwise, the order is 2 divided by the Euler characteristic.
Equal groups
The following groups are isomorphic:

1* and *11
22 and 221
*22 and *221
2* and 2*1.

This is because 1-fold rotation is the "empty" rotation.
Two-dimensional groups





 A perfect snowflake would have *6• symmetry,


 The pentagon has symmetry *5•, the whole image with arrows 5•.


 The Flag of Hong Kong has 5 fold rotation symmetry, 5•.



The symmetry of a 2D object without translational symmetry can be described by the 3D symmetry type by adding a third dimension to the object which does not add or spoil symmetry. For example, for a 2D image we can consider a piece of carton with that image displayed on one side; the shape of the carton should be such that it does not spoil the symmetry, or it can be imagined to be infinite. Thus we have n• and *n•. The bullet (•) is added on one- and two-dimensional groups to imply the existence of a fixed point. (In three-dimensions these groups exist in an n-fold digonal orbifold and are represented as nn and *nn.)
Similarly, a 1D image can be drawn horizontally on a piece of carton, with a provision to avoid additional symmetry with respect to the line of the image, e.g. by drawing a horizontal bar under the image. Thus the discrete symmetry groups in one dimension are *•, *1•, ∞• and *∞•.
Another way of constructing a 3D object from a 1D or 2D object for describing the symmetry is taking the Cartesian product of the object and an asymmetric 2D or 1D object, respectively.
