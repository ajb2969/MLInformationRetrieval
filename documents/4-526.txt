   107 Camilla      107 Camilla   107 Camilla is one of the largest main-belt  asteroids . It orbits within the Cybele Group , beyond most main-belt asteroids. It has a very dark surface and primitive carbonaceous composition. It was discovered by N. R. Pogson on November 17, 1868, and named after Camilla , Queen of the Volsci in Roman mythology . 1  10 µ radiometric data collected from Kitt Peak in 1975 gave a diameter estimate of 209 km. 2 Lightcurve analysis indicates that Camilla's pole most likely points towards ecliptic coordinates (β, λ) = (+51°, 72°) with a 10° uncertainty, 3 which gives it an axial tilt of 29°.  Satellite (S/2001 (107) I)  On 1 March 2001, a satellite of Camilla was found by A. Storrs, F. Vilas, R. Landis, E. Wells, C. Woods, B. Zellner, and M. Gaffey using the Hubble Space Telescope . 4 It has been designated S/2001 (107) 1 but has not yet received an official name.  Later observations in September 2005 with the VLT allowed the determination of an orbit. 5 Apart from data in infobox, the inclination was found to be 3 ± 1° with respect to an axis pointing towards (β, λ) = (+55°, 75°). 6 Given the ~10° uncertainty in the actual rotational axis of Camilla, one can say that the orbit's inclination is less than 10°.  The satellite is estimated to measure about 11 km in diameter. 7 Assuming a similar density to the primary, this would give it an approximate mass of ~1.5     ×    10  1   5       absent     superscript  10  1   5     \times 10^{1}5   kg. It has a similar colour to the primary. 8   References  External links   Data on (87) Sylvia from Johnston's archive (maintained by W. R.
