   Monoid ring      Monoid ring   In abstract algebra , a monoid ring is a ring constructed from a ring and a monoid , just as a group ring is constructed from a ring and a group .  Definition  Let R be a ring and let G be a monoid. The monoid ring or monoid algebra of G over R , denoted R [ G ] or RG , is the set of formal sums     ∑   g  ∈  G      r  g   g       subscript     g  G       subscript  r  g   g     \sum_{g\in G}r_{g}g   , where     r  g   ∈  R       subscript  r  g   R    r_{g}\in R   for each    g  ∈  G      g  G    g\in G   and r g = 0 for all but finitely many g , equipped with coefficient-wise addition, and the multiplication in which the elements of R commute with the elements of G . More formally, R [ G ] is the set of functions  such that } is finite, equipped with addition of functions, and with multiplication defined by        (   ϕ  ψ   )    (  g  )    =    ∑    k  ℓ   =  g     ϕ   (  k  )   ψ   (  ℓ  )             ϕ  ψ   g     subscript       k  normal-ℓ   g      ϕ  k  ψ  normal-ℓ      (\phi\psi)(g)=\sum_{k\ell=g}\phi(k)\psi(\ell)   . If G is a group , then R [ G ] is also called the group ring of G over R .  Universal property  Given R and G , there is a ring homomorphism sending each r to r 1 (where 1 is the identity element of G ), and a monoid homomorphism (where the latter is viewed as a monoid under multiplication) sending each g to 1 g (where 1 is the multiplicative identity of R ). We have that α( r ) commutes with β( g ) for all r in R and g in G .  The universal property of the monoid ring states that given a ring S , a ring homomorphism , and a monoid homomorphism  to the multiplicative monoid of S , such that α'( r ) commutes with β'( g ) for all r in R and g in G , there is a unique ring homomorphism  such that composing α and β with γ produces α' and β '.  Augmentation  The augmentation is the ring homomorphism  defined by        η   (    ∑   g  ∈  G      r  g   g    )    =    ∑   g  ∈  G     r  g     .        η    subscript     g  G       subscript  r  g   g       subscript     g  G     subscript  r  g      \eta(\sum_{g\in G}r_{g}g)=\sum_{g\in G}r_{g}.     The kernel of η is called the augmentation ideal . It is a free  R - module with basis consisting of 1– g for all g in G not equal to 1.  Examples  Given a ring R and the (additive) monoid of natural numbers  N (or { x n } viewed multiplicatively), we obtain the ring R [{ x n }] =: R [ x ] of polynomials over R . The monoid N n (with the addition) gives the polynomial ring with n variables: R [ N n ] =: R [X 1 , ..., X n ].  Generalization  If G is a semigroup , the same construction yields a semigroup ring  R [ G ].  See also   Free algebra   References     Further reading   R.Gilmer. Commutative semigroup rings .
