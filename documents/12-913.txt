Tensor derivative (continuum mechanics)

The derivatives of scalars, vectors, and second-order tensors with respect to second-order tensors are of considerable use in continuum mechanics. These derivatives are used in the theories of nonlinear elasticity and plasticity, particularly in the design of algorithms for numerical simulations.1
The directional derivative provides a systematic way of finding these derivatives.2
Derivatives with respect to vectors and second-order tensors
The definitions of directional derivatives for various situations are given below. It is assumed that the functions are sufficiently smooth that derivatives can be taken.

Gradient of a tensor field
The gradient, 
 
 
 
 , of a tensor field 
 
 
 
  in the direction of an arbitrary constant vector c is defined as:


 
  The gradient of a tensor field of order n is a tensor field of order n+1.
Cartesian coordinates
If 
 
 
 
  are the basis vectors in a Cartesian coordinate system, with coordinates of points denoted by (
 
 
 
 
 ), then the gradient of the tensor field 
 
 
 
  is given by









Proof





The vectors x and c can be written as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  . Let y := x + αc. In that case the gradient is given by








Since the basis vectors do not vary in a Cartesian coordinate system we have the following relations for the gradients of a scalar field 
 
 
 
 , a vector field v, and a second-order tensor field 
 
 
 
 .



Curvilinear coordinates
If 
 
 
 
  are the contravariant basis vectors in a curvilinear coordinate system, with coordinates of points denoted by (
 
 
 
 ), then the gradient of the tensor field 
 
 
 
  is given by (see 3 for a proof.)



From this definition we have the following relations for the gradients of a scalar field 
 
 
 
 , a vector field v, and a second-order tensor field 
 
 
 
 .



where the Christoffel symbol

 
 
  is defined using



Cylindrical polar coordinates
In cylindrical coordinates, the gradient is given by



Divergence of a tensor field
The divergence of a tensor field 
 
 
 
  is defined using the recursive relation


 
  where c is an arbitrary constant vector and v is a vector field. If 
 
 
 
  is a tensor field of order n > 1 then the divergence of the field is a tensor of order n−1.
Cartesian coordinates
In a Cartesian coordinate system we have the following relations for a vector field v and a second-order tensor field 
 
 
 
 .



Note that last relation can be found in reference 4 under relation (1.14.13). Note also that according to the same paper in the case of the second-order tensor field, we have:



Curvilinear coordinates
In curvilinear coordinates, the divergences of a vector field v and a second-order tensor field 
 
 
 
  are



Cylindrical polar coordinates
In cylindrical polar coordinates



Curl of a tensor field
The curl of an order-n > 1 tensor field 
 
 
 
  is also defined using the recursive relation


 
  where c is an arbitrary constant vector and v is a vector field.
Curl of a first-order tensor (vector) field
Consider a vector field v and an arbitrary constant vector c. In index notation, the cross product is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the permutation symbol. Then,


 
  Therefore



Curl of a second-order tensor field
For a second-order tensor 
 
 



 
  Hence, using the definition of the curl of a first-order tensor field,


 
  Therefore, we have



Identities involving the curl of a tensor field
The most commonly used identity involving the curl of a tensor field, 
 
 
 
 , is


 
  This identity hold for tensor fields of all orders. For the important case of a second-order tensor, 
 
 
 
 , this identity implies that



Derivative of the determinant of a second-order tensor
The derivative of the determinant of a second order tensor 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  In an orthonormal basis, the components of 
 
 
 
  can be written as a matrix A. In that case, the right hand side corresponds the cofactors of the matrix.






Proof





Let 
 
 
 
  be a second order tensor and let 
 
 
 
 . Then, from the definition of the derivative of a scalar valued function of a tensor, we have


 
 
  Recall that we can expand the determinant of a tensor in the form of a characteristic equation in terms of the invariants 
 
 
 
 
  using (note the sign of λ)


 
  Using this expansion we can write


 
 
  Recall that the invariant 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  Hence,


 
  Invoking the arbitrariness of 
 
 
 
  we then have








Derivatives of the invariants of a second-order tensor
The principal invariants of a second order tensor are


 
 
  The derivatives of these three invariants with respect to 
 
 
 
  are









Proof





From the derivative of the determinant we know that


 
  For the derivatives of the other two invariants, let us go back to the characteristic equation


 
  Using the same approach as for the determinant of a tensor, we can show that


 
  Now the left hand side can be expanded as


 
 
  Hence


 
  or,


 
  Expanding the right hand side and separating terms on the left hand side gives


 
  or,


 
 
  If we define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we can write the above as


 
 
  Collecting terms containing various powers of λ, we get


 
 
  Then, invoking the arbitrariness of λ, we have


 
 
  This implies that








Derivative of the second-order identity tensor
Let 
 
 
 
  be the second order identity tensor. Then the derivative of this tensor with respect to a second order tensor 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  This is because 
 
 
 
  is independent of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Derivative of a second-order tensor with respect to itself
Let 
 
 
 
  be a second order tensor. Then


 
  Therefore,


 
  Here 
 
 
 
  is the fourth order identity tensor. In index notation with respect to an orthonormal basis



This result implies that


 
  where



Therefore, if the tensor 
 
 
 
  is symmetric, then the derivative is also symmetric and we get


 
  where the symmetric fourth order identity tensor is



Derivative of the inverse of a second-order tensor
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two second order tensors, then


 
  In index notation with respect to an orthonormal basis


 
  We also have


 
  In index notation


 
  If the tensor 
 
 
 
  is symmetric then









Proof





Recall that


 
  Since 
 
 
 
 , we can write


 
  Using the product rule for second order tensors


 
  we get


 
  or,


 
  Therefore,








Integration by parts
 Another important operation related to tensor derivatives in continuum mechanics is integration by parts. The formula for integration by parts can be written as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are differentiable tensor fields of arbitrary order, 
 
 
 
  is the unit outward normal to the domain over which the tensor fields are defined, 
 
 
 
  represents a generalized tensor product operator, and 
 
 
 
  is a generalized gradient operator. When 
 
 
 
  is equal to the identity tensor, we get the divergence theorem


 
  We can express the formula for integration by parts in Cartesian index notation as


 
  For the special case where the tensor product operation is a contraction of one index and the gradient operation is a divergence, and both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are second order tensors, we have


 
  In index notation,
