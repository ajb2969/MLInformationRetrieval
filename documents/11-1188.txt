   1,4-beta-D-xylan synthase      1,4-beta-D-xylan synthase   In enzymology , a 1,4-beta-D-xylan synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-D-xylose + (1,4-beta-D-xylan)n   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + (1,4-beta-D-xylan)n + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-D-xylose and (1,4-beta-D-xylan)n , whereas its two products are UDP and (1,4-beta-D-xylan)n+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-xylose:1,4-beta-D-xylan 4-beta-D-xylosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoxylose-1,4-beta-xylan xylosyltransferase , 1,4-beta-xylan synthase , xylan synthase , and xylan synthetase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism and nucleotide sugars metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
