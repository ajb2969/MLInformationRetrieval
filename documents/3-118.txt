Kuratowski closure axioms

In topology and related branches of mathematics, the Kuratowski closure axioms are a set of axioms that can be used to define a topological structure on a set. They are equivalent to the more commonly used open set definition. They were first introduced by Kazimierz Kuratowski.1
A similar set of axioms can be used to define a topological structure using only the dual notion of interior operator.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a set and 
 
 
 
  its power set.
 A Kuratowski Closure Operator is an assignment 
 
 
 
  with the following properties:2



 
  (Preservation of Nullary Union)


 
  (Extensivity)


 
  (Preservation of Binary Union)


 
  (Idempotence)

If the last axiom, idempotence, is omitted, then the axioms define a preclosure operator.
A consequence of the third axiom is
 
 
 
  (Preservation of Inclusion).3
The four Kuratowski closure axioms can be replaced by a single condition, namely,4



Connection to other axiomatizations of topology
Induction of Topology
Construction
 A closure operator naturally induces a topology as follows:
 A subset 
 
 
 
  is called closed if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
Empty Set and Entire Space are closed:
 By extensitivity, 
 
 
 
  and since closure maps the power set of 
 
 
 
  into itself (that is, the image of any subset is a subset of 
 
 
 
 ), 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is closed.
 The preservation of nullary unions states that 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is closed.
Arbitrary intersections of closed sets are closed:
 Let 
 
 
 
  be an arbitrary set of indices and 
 
 
 
  closed for every 
 
 
 
 .
 By extensitivity, 
 
 

 Also, by preservation of inclusions, 
 
 

 Therefore, 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is closed.
Finite unions of closed sets are closed:
 Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite set of indices and let 
 
 
 
  be closed for every 
 
 
 
 .
 From the preservation of binary unions and using induction we have 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is closed.
Induction of closure
In any induced topology (relative to the subset A) the closed sets induce a new closure operator that is just the original closure operator restricted to A

Recovering notions from topology
Closeness
 A point 
 
 
 
  is close to a subset 
 
 
 
  iff 
 
 
 
 .
Continuity
 A function 
 
 
 
  is continuous at a point 
 
 
 
  iff 
 
 
 
 .
