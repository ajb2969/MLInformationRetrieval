TraPPE (an acronym for Transferable Potentials for Phase Equilibria) is a family of molecular mechanics force fields developed primarily by the Siepmann group at the University of Minnesota.1 The force field is parametrized against fluid-phase equilibria data with a strong emphasis on transferability. The term "transferable" implies that the same force field parameters are used to describe a given interaction site in different molecules (e.g., identical parameters should be used for the methyl group in n-pentane, 1-pentene, and 1-pentanol) and that the force field is applicable to predict different properties (e.g., thermodynamic, structural, or transport) across a wide range of state points (e.g., pressure, temperature, or composition).2
Four major versions of the force fields exist for (mostly) organic molecules, differing in their levels of sophistication: TraPPE-CG (coarse grain), TraPPE-UA (united-atom), TraPPE-EH (explicit-hydrogen), and TraPPE-pol (polarizable). In addition, TraPPE-SM (small molecule) and TraPPE-zeo (zeolites) covers CO
 
 
 
 , N
 
 
 
 , O
 
 
 
 , NH
 
 
 
 , zeolites, etc.3 Parts of the TraPPE force field are currently implemented in a number of software packages including Towhee, Materials Design, Culgi, and Scinomics.
Functional form
The basic functional form of the TraPPE force field is (for the united-atom version): 4



Notes:

In the united-atom model, a CH
 
 
 
  group is treated as a single interaction site or 'pseudo atom' located on the carbon center.


TraPPE typically uses fixed bond lengths and therefore does not include a bond stretching term in the potential. However, the molecule is still semi-flexible due to the bending and torsional degrees of freedom.


The double summation over site indices i and j represents non-bonded interactions between two pseudo atoms of different molecules or of the same molecule but separated by (usually) at least four bonds.


Lennard-Jones potential (first term of summation) is used to describe repulsion and dispersion. 
 
 
 
  is related to the equilibrium distance, 
 
 
 
 , by
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the well depth. For unlike Lennard-Jones interactions, standard Lorentz–Berthelot combining rules are used.


Coulomb potential (second term of summation) is used to describe first-order electrostatic interactions.


The parameters for the Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potentials reflect effective values that account in a mean-field manner for higher-order and many-body dispersion and induction effects. In general, the parameters used in the TraPPE force field are fit to the vapor liquid coexistence curves of a few selected target compounds, but are found to reproduce transport properties as well.
