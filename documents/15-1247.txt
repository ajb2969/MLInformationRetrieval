   16S rRNA (cytosine1407-C5)-methyltransferase      16S rRNA (cytosine1407-C5)-methyltransferase   16S rRNA (cytosine 1407 -C 5 )-methyltransferase (, RNA m5C methyltransferase YebU , RsmF , YebU ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytosine 1407 -C 5 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 1407 in 16S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine 1407 in 16S rRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates cytosine 1407 at C 5 in 16S rRNA.
