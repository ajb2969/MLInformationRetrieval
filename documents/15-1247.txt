16S rRNA (cytosine1407-C5)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (cytosine1407-C5)-methyltransferase (, RNA m5C methyltransferase YebU, RsmF, YebU) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytosine1407-C5)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine1407 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine1407 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates cytosine1407 at C5 in 16S rRNA.
