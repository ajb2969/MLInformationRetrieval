Radiodrome

In geometry, a radiodrome is the path followed by a point which is pursuing another point. The term is derived from the Latin word radius (beam) and the Greek word dromos (running). The classical (and best-known) form of a radiodrome is known as the "dog curve"; this is the path a dog follows when it swims across a stream with a current after food it has spotted on the other side. Because the dog drifts downwards with the current, it will have to change its heading; it will also have to swim further than if it had computed the optimal heading. This case was described by Pierre Bouguer in 1732.
A radiodrome may alternatively be described as the path a dog follows when chasing a hare, assuming that the hare runs in a straight line at a constant velocity. It is illustrated by the following figure:
(Figure)
The path of a dog chasing a hare running along a vertical straight line at a constant speed. The dog runs towards the momentary position of the hare, and will have to change his heading continuously. The speed of the dog is 20% faster than the speed of the hare.|alt=Graph of a radiodrome, also known as a dog curve

Mathematical analysis
Introduce a coordinate system with origin at the position of the dog at time zero and with y-axis in the direction the hare is running with the constant speed 
 
 
 
 . The position of the hare at time zero is 
 
 
 
  and at time 
 
 
 
  it is



The dog runs with the constant speed 
 
 
 
  towards the momentary position of the hare. The differential equation corresponding to the movement of the dog, 
 
 
 
 , is consequently

It is possible to obtain a closed form analytical expression 
 
 
 
  for the motion of the dog
From () and () follows that



Multiplying both sides with 
 
 
 
  and taking the derivative with respect to 
 
 
 
  using that



or


=\frac{V_t}{V_d(A_x-x)}  |7}}

From this relation follows that



where 
 
 
 
  is the constant of integration that is determined by the initial value of

}{y'(0)+\sqrt\right)  |10}}

If now 
 
 
 
  this relation is integrated as


-

\frac{ (1-\frac{x}{A_x}) ^{1 + \frac{V_t}{V_d}} }{ (y'(0)+\sqrt
where 
 
 
 
  is the constant of integration.
If 
 
 
 
  one gets instead

{{NumBlk|:| 

\frac{ (1-\frac{x}{A_x}) ^2}{(y'(0)+\sqrt
If 
 
 
 
  one gets from () that

{{NumBlk|:|

In the case illustrated in the figure above 
 
 
 
  and the chase starts with the hare at position 
 
 
 
  what means that 
 
 
 
 . From () one therefore gets hat the hare is caught at position 
 
 
 
  and consequently that the hare will run the total distance 
 
 
 
  before being caught.
If 
 
 
 
  one gets from () and () that 
 
 
 
  what means that the hare never will be caught whenever the chase starts.
