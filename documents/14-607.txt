   Radiodrome      Radiodrome   In geometry , a radiodrome is the path followed by a point which is pursuing another point. The term is derived from the Latin word radius (beam) and the Greek word dromos (running). The classical (and best-known) form of a radiodrome is known as the "dog curve"; this is the path a dog follows when it swims across a stream with a current after food it has spotted on the other side. Because the dog drifts downwards with the current, it will have to change its heading; it will also have to swim further than if it had computed the optimal heading. This case was described by Pierre Bouguer in 1732.  A radiodrome may alternatively be described as the path a dog follows when chasing a hare, assuming that the hare runs in a straight line at a constant velocity. It is illustrated by the following figure:  (Figure)  The path of a dog chasing a hare running along a vertical straight line at a constant speed. The dog runs towards the momentary position of the hare , and will have to change his heading continuously. The speed of the dog is 20% faster than the speed of the hare.|alt=Graph of a radiodrome, also known as a dog curve   Mathematical analysis  Introduce a coordinate system with origin at the position of the dog at time zero and with y-axis in the direction the hare is running with the constant speed    V  t     subscript  V  t    V_{t}   . The position of the hare at time zero is    (    A  x    ,   A  y   )      subscript  A  x    subscript  A  y     (A_{x}\ ,\ A_{y})   and at time   t   t   t   it is     The dog runs with the constant speed    V  d     subscript  V  d    V_{d}   towards the momentary position of the hare.
