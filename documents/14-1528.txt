   Quasi-relative interior      Quasi-relative interior   In topology , a branch of mathematics, the quasi-relative interior of a subset of a vector space is a refinement of the concept of the interior . Formally, if   X   X   X   is a linear space then the quasi-relative interior of    A  ⊆  X      A  X    A\subseteq X   is       qri   (  A  )    :=   {   x  ∈  A   :     cone  ¯    (   A  -  x   )    is a linear subspace   }      assign   qri  A    conditional-set    x  A      normal-¯  cone     A  x    is a linear subspace      \operatorname{qri}(A):=\left\{x\in A:\operatorname{\overline{cone}}(A-x)\text{%
  is a linear subspace}\right\}\,   where     cone  ¯    (  ⋅  )       normal-¯  cone   normal-⋅    \operatorname{\overline{cone}}(\cdot)   denotes the closure of the conic hull . 1  Let   X   X   X   is a normed vector space, if    C  ⊂  X      C  X    C\subset X   is a convex  finite-dimensional set then     qri   (  C  )    =   ri   (  C  )         qri  C    ri  C     \operatorname{qri}(C)=\operatorname{ri}(C)   such that   ri   ri   \operatorname{ri}   is the relative interior . 2  See also   Interior (topology)  Relative interior  Algebraic interior   References  "  Category:Topology     ↩  ↩
