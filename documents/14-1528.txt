Quasi-relative interior

In topology, a branch of mathematics, the quasi-relative interior of a subset of a vector space is a refinement of the concept of the interior. Formally, if 
 
 
 
  is a linear space then the quasi-relative interior of 
 
 
 
  is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the closure of the conic hull.1
Let 
 
 
 
  is a normed vector space, if 
 
 
 
  is a convex finite-dimensional set then 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is the relative interior.2
