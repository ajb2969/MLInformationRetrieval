   Boole polynomials      Boole polynomials   In mathematics, the Boole polynomials  s n ( x ) are polynomials given by the generating function       ∑     s  n    (  x  )    t  n    /   n  !     =     (   1  +  t   )   x    1  +    (   1  +  t   )   λ                subscript  s  n   x   superscript  t  n      n        superscript    1  t   x     1   superscript    1  t   λ       \displaystyle\sum s_{n}(x)t^{n}/n!=\frac{(1+t)^{x}}{1+(1+t)^{\lambda}}   , .
