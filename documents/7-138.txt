Kummer ring

In abstract algebra, a Kummer ring

 
  is a subring of the ring of complex numbers, such that each of its elements has the form


 
  where ζ is an mth root of unity, i.e.


 
  and n0 through nm−1 are integers.
A Kummer ring is an extension of 
 
 
 
 , the ring of integers, hence the symbol 
 
 
 
 . Since the minimal polynomial of ζ is the mth cyclotomic polynomial, the ring 
 
 
 
  is an extension of degree 
 
 
 
  (where φ denotes Euler's totient function).
An attempt to visualize a Kummer ring on an Argand diagram might yield something resembling a quaint Renaissance map with compass roses and rhumb lines.
The set of units of a Kummer ring contains 
 
 
 
 . By Dirichlet's unit theorem, there are also units of infinite order, except in the cases ,  (in which case we have the ordinary ring of integers), the case  (the Gaussian integers) and the cases ,  (the Eisenstein integers).
Kummer rings are named after Ernst Kummer, who studied the unique factorization of their elements.
