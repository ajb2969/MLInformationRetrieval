   Kummer ring      Kummer ring   In abstract algebra , a Kummer ring     ℤ   [  ζ  ]       ℤ   delimited-[]  ζ     \mathbb{Z}[\zeta]   is a subring of the ring of complex numbers , such that each of its elements has the form       n  0   +    n  1   ζ   +    n  2    ζ  2    +  …  +    n   m  -  1     ζ   m  -  1          subscript  n  0      subscript  n  1   ζ      subscript  n  2    superscript  ζ  2    normal-…     subscript  n    m  1     superscript  ζ    m  1       n_{0}+n_{1}\zeta+n_{2}\zeta^{2}+...+n_{m-1}\zeta^{m-1}   where ζ is an m th root of unity , i.e.      ζ  =   e    2  π  i   /  m        ζ   superscript  e      2  π  i   m      \zeta=e^{2\pi i/m}   and n 0 through n m −1 are integers .  A Kummer ring is an extension of   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   , the ring of integers , hence the symbol    ℤ   [  ζ  ]       ℤ   delimited-[]  ζ     \mathbb{Z}[\zeta]   . Since the minimal polynomial of ζ is the m th cyclotomic polynomial , the ring    ℤ   [  ζ  ]       ℤ   delimited-[]  ζ     \mathbb{Z}[\zeta]   is an extension of degree    ϕ   (  m  )       ϕ  m    \phi(m)   (where φ denotes Euler's totient function ).  An attempt to visualize a Kummer ring on an Argand diagram might yield something resembling a quaint Renaissance map with compass roses and rhumb lines .  The set of units of a Kummer ring contains    {  1  ,  ζ  ,   ζ  2   ,  …  ,   ζ   m  -  1    }     1  ζ   superscript  ζ  2   normal-…   superscript  ζ    m  1      \{1,\zeta,\zeta^{2},\ldots,\zeta^{m-1}\}   . By Dirichlet's unit theorem , there are also units of infinite order, except in the cases ,  (in which case we have the ordinary ring of integers ), the case  (the Gaussian integers ) and the cases ,  (the Eisenstein integers ).  Kummer rings are named after Ernst Kummer , who studied the unique factorization of their elements.
