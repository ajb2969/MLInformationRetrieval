Szyszkowski equation

The Szyskowski Equation1 has been used by Meissner and Michaels2 to describe the decrease in surface tension of aqueous solutions of carboxylic acids, alcohols and esters at varying mole fractions. It describes the exponential decrease of the surface tension at low concentrations reasonably but should be used only at concentrations below 1 mole%.3
Equation


 
  with:

σm is surface tension of the mixture
σw is surface tension of pure water
a is component specific constant (see table below)
x is mole fraction of the solvated component

The equation can be rearranged to be explicit in a:


 
 
  This allows the direct calculation of that component specific parameter a from experimental data.
The equation can also be written as:


 
  with:

γ is surface tension of the mixture
γ0 is surface tension of pure water
R is ideal gas constant 8.31 J/(mol*K)
T is temperature in K
ω is cross-sectional area of the surfactant molecules at the surface

The surface tension of pure water is dependent on temperature. At room temperature (298 K), it is equal to 71.97 mN/m 4
Parameters

This example shows a good agreement between the published value a=2.6*10−3 and the calculated value a=2.59*10−3 at the smallest given mole fraction of 0.00861 but at higher concentrations of propionic acid the value of an increases considerably, showing deviations from the predicted value.
