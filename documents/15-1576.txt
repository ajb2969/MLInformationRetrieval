   Neamine transaminase      Neamine transaminase   Neamine transaminase (, glutamate---6'-dehydroparomamine aminotransferase , btrB (gene) , neoN (gene) , kacL (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name neamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   neamine + 2-oxoglutarate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6'-dehydroparomamine + L- glutamate    The reaction occurs in vivo in the opposite direction.
