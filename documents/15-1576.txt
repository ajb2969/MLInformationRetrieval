Neamine transaminase

Neamine transaminase (, glutamate---6'-dehydroparomamine aminotransferase, btrB (gene), neoN (gene), kacL (gene)) is an enzyme with system name neamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

neamine + 2-oxoglutarate

 
  6'-dehydroparomamine + L-glutamate


The reaction occurs in vivo in the opposite direction.
