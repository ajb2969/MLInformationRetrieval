   Graph energy      Graph energy   In mathematics , the energy of a graph is the sum of the absolute values of the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of the graph. This quantity is studied in the context of spectral graph theory .  More precisely, let G be a graph with n  vertices . It is assumed that G is simple , that is, it does not contain loops or parallel edges. Let A be the adjacency matrix of G and let    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   ,    i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       i   1  normal-…  n     i=1,\ldots,n   , be the eigenvalues of A . Then the energy of the graph is defined as:        E   (  G  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n    |   λ  i   |     .
