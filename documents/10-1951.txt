Benzylsuccinate synthase




Benzylsuccinate synthase

In enzymology, a benzylsuccinate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

benzylsuccinate 
 
 
 
  toluene + fumarate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, benzylsuccinate, and two products, toluene and fumarate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically in the "catch-all" class of carbon-carbon lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzylsuccinate fumarate-lyase (toluene-forming). This enzyme is also called benzylsuccinate fumarate-lyase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation.
