P-group generation algorithm

In mathematics, specifically group theory, finite groups of prime power order 
 
 
 
 , for a fixed prime number 
 
 
 
  and varying integer exponents 
 
 
 
 , are briefly called finite p-groups.
The p-group generation algorithm by M. F. Newman 1 and E. A. O'Brien 2 3 is a recursive process for constructing the descendant tree of an assigned finite p-group which is taken as the root of the tree.
Lower exponent-p central series
For a finite p-group 
 
 
 
 , the lower exponent-p central series (briefly lower p-central series) of 
 
 
 
  is a descending series 
 
 
 
  of characteristic subgroups of 
 
 
 
 , defined recursively by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 . Since any non-trivial finite p-group 
 
 
 
  is nilpotent, there exists an integer 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is called the exponent-p class (briefly p-class) of 
 
 
 
 . Only the trivial group 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
 . Generally, for any finite p-group 
 
 
 
 , its p-class can be defined as 
 
 
 
 .
The complete series is given by 
 
 
 
 ,
since 
 
 
 
  is the Frattini subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
For the convenience of the reader and for pointing out the shifted numeration, we recall that the (usual) lower central series of 
 
 
 
  is also a descending series 
 
 
 
  of characteristic subgroups of 
 
 
 
 , defined recursively by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 . As above, for any non-trivial finite p-group 
 
 
 
 , there exists an integer 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is called the nilpotency class of 
 
 
 
 , whereas 
 
 
 
  is called the index of nilpotency of 
 
 
 
 . Only the trivial group 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
 .
The complete series is given by 
 
 
 
 ,
since 
 
 
 
  is the commutator subgroup or derived subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
The following Rules should be remembered for the exponent-p class:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite p-group.
:# Rule
 
 
 
 , since the 
 
 
 
  descend more quickly than the 
 
 
 
 .
:# Rule
 
 
 
 , for some group 
 
 


 
 , for any 
 
 
 
 .
:# Rule: For any 
 
 
 
 , the conditions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  imply 
 
 
 
 .
:# Rule: For any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 


 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 .
Parents and descendant trees
The parent

 
  of a finite non-trivial p-group 
 
 
 
  with exponent-p class 
 
 
 
  is defined as the quotient 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  by the last non-trivial term 
 
 
 
  of the lower exponent-p central series of 
 
 
 
 . Conversely, in this case, 
 
 
 
  is called an immediate descendant of 
 
 
 
 . The p-classes of parent and immediate descendant are connected by 
 
 
 
 .
A descendant tree is a hierarchical structure for visualizing parent-descendant relations between isomorphism classes of finite p-groups. The vertices of a  descendant tree are isomorphism classes of finite p-groups. However, a vertex will always be labelled by selecting a representative of the corresponding isomorphism class. Whenever a vertex 
 
 
 
  is the parent of a vertex 
 
 
 
  a directed edge of the descendant tree is defined by 
 
 
 
  in the direction of the canonical projection

 
  onto the quotient 
 
 
 
 .
In a descendant tree, the concepts of parents and immediate descendants can be generalized. A vertex 
 
 
 
  is a descendant of a vertex 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is an ancestor of 
 
 
 
 , if either 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
  or there is a path

 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , of directed edges from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . The vertices forming the path necessarily coincide with the iterated parents

 
  of 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 . They can also be viewed as the successive quotients

of p-class

 
  of 
 
 
 
  when the p-class of 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 . In particular, every non-trivial finite p-group 
 
 
 
  defines a maximal path (consisting of 
 
 
 
  edges) 
 
 

 
  ending in the trivial group 
 
 
 
 . The last but one quotient of the maximal path of 
 
 
 
  is the elementary abelian p-group 
 
 
 
  of rank 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the generator rank of 
 
 
 
 .
Generally, the descendant tree

of a vertex

 
  is the subtree of all descendants of 
 
 
 
 , starting at the root

 
 . The maximal possible descendant tree 
 
 
 
  of the trivial group 
 
 
 
  contains all finite p-groups and is exceptional, since the trivial group 
 
 
 
  has all the infinitely many elementary abelian p-groups with varying generator rank 
 
 
 
  as its immediate descendants. However, any non-trivial finite p-group (of order divisible by 
 
 
 
 ) possesses only finitely many immediate descendants.
p-covering group
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite p-group with 
 
 
generators. Our goal is to compile a complete list of pairwise non-isomorphic immediate descendants of 
 
 
 
 . It turned out that all immediate descendants can be obtained as quotients of a certain extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  which is called the p-covering group of 
 
 
 
  and can be constructed in the following manner.
We can certainly find a presentation of 
 
 
 
  in the form of an exact sequence

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the free group with 
 
 
 
  generators and 
 
 
 
  is an epimorphism with kernel 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
  consisting of the defining relations for 
 
 
 
 . For elements 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the conjugate 
 
 
 
  and thus also the commutator 
 
 
 
  are contained in 
 
 
 
 . Consequently, 
 
 
 
  is a characteristic subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , and the p-multiplicator

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is an elementary abelian p-group, since 
 
 
 
 . Now we can define the p-covering group of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , and the exact sequence 
 
 
 
  shows that 
 
 
 
  is an extension of 
 
 
 
  by the elementary abelian p-multiplicator. We call 
 
 
 
  the p-multiplicator rank of 
 
 
 
 .
Let us assume now that the assigned finite p-group 
 
 
 
  is of p-class 
 
 
 
 . Then the conditions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  imply 
 
 
 
 , according to Rule 3, and we can define the nucleus of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  as a subgroup of the p-multiplicator. Consequently, the nuclear rank

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is bounded from above by the p-multiplicator rank.
Allowable subgroups
As before, let 
 
 
 
  be a finite p-group with 
 
 
generators. Any p-elementary abelian central extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  by a p-elementary abelian subgroup 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a quotient of the p-covering group 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . The reason is that there exists an epimorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the canonical projection. Consequently, we have 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
 . Further, 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
  is p-elementary, and 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
  is central. Together this shows that 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
  induces the desired epimorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . In particular, an immediate descendant 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is a p-elementary abelian central extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 .
A subgroup 
 
 
 
  of the p-multiplicator of 
 
 
 
  is called allowable if it is given by the kernel 
 
 
 
  of an epimorphism 
 
 
 
  onto an immediate descendant 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . An equivalent characterization is that 
 
 
 
 .
Therefore, the first part of our goal to compile a list of all immediate descendants of 
 
 
 
  is done, when we have constructed all allowable subgroups of 
 
 
 
  which supplement the nucleus 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . However, in general the list 
 
 
 
  will be redundant, due to isomorphisms 
 
 
 
  among the immediate descendants.
Orbits under extended automorphisms
Two allowable subgroups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are called equivalent if the quotients 
 
 
 
 , that are the corresponding immediate descendants of 
 
 
 
 , are isomorphic.
Such an isomorphism 
 
 
 
  between immediate descendants of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  has the property that 
 
 
 
  and thus induces an automorphism 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  which can be extended to an automorphism 
 
 
 
  of the p-covering group 
 
 
 
 of 
 
 
 
 . The restriction of this extended automorphism

 
  to the p-multiplicator 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is determined uniquely by 
 
 
 
 .
Since 
 
 
 
 , each extended automorphism 
 
 
 
  induces a permutation 
 
 
 
  of the allowable subgroups 
 
 
 
 . We define 
 
 
 
  to be the permutation group generated by all permutations induced by automorphisms of 
 
 
 
 . Then the map 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is an epimorphism and the equivalence classes of allowable subgroups 
 
 
 
  are precisely the orbits of allowable subgroups under the action of the permutation group 
 
 
 
 .
Eventually, our goal to compile a list 
 
 
 
  of all immediate descendants of 
 
 
 
  will be done, when we select a representative 
 
 
 
  for each of the 
 
 
 
  orbits of allowable subgroups of 
 
 
 
  under the action of 
 
 
 
 . This is precisely what the p-group generation algorithm does in a single step of the recursive procedure for constructing the descendant tree of an assigned root.
Capable p-groups and step sizes
A finite p-group 
 
 
 
  is called capable (or extendable) if it possesses at least one immediate descendant, otherwise it is terminal (or a leaf). The nuclear rank 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  admits a decision about the capability of 
 
 
 
 :
:* 
 
 
 
  is terminal if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
:* 
 
 
 
  is capable if and only if 
 
 
 
 . In the case of capability, 
 
 
 
  has immediate descendants of 
 
 
 
  different step sizes

 
 , in dependence on the index 
 
 
 
  of the corresponding allowable subgroup 
 
 
 
  in the p-multiplicator 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
  is of order 
 
 
 
 , then an immediate descendant of step size 
 
 
 
  is of order 
 
 

 
 .
For the related phenomenon of multifurcation of a descendant tree at a vertex 
 
 
 
  with nuclear rank 
 
 
 
  see the article on descendant trees.
The p-group generation algorithm provides the flexibility to restrict the construction of immediate descendants to those of a single fixed step size 
 
 
 
 , which is very convenient in the case of huge descendant numbers (see the next section).
Numbers of immediate descendants
We denote the number of all immediate descendants, resp. immediate descendants of step size

 
 , of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , resp. 
 
 
 
 . Then we have 
 
 
 
 . As concrete examples, we present some interesting finite metabelian p-groups with extensive sets of immediate descendants, using the SmallGroups identifiers and additionally pointing out the numbers 
 
 
 
  of capable immediate descendants in the usual format 
 
 
 
  as given by actual implementations of the p-group generation algorithm in the computer algebra systems GAP and MAGMA.
First, let 
 
 
 
 .
We begin with groups having abelianization of type 
 
 
 
 . See Figure 4 in the article on descendant trees.
:* The group 
 
 
 
  of coclass 
 
 
 
  has ranks 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and descendant numbers 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .

:* One of its immediate descendants, the group 
 
 
 
 , has ranks 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and descendant numbers 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
In contrast, groups with abelianization of type 
 
 
 
  are partially located beyond the limit of computability.

Schur multiplier
Via the isomorphism 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  the quotient group 
 
 
 
  can be viewed as the additive analogue of the multiplicative group 
 
 
 
  of all roots of unity.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a prime number and 
 
 
 
  be a finite p-group with presentation 
 
 
 
  as in the previous section. Then the second cohomology group 
 
 
 
  of the 
 
 
 
 -module 
 
 
 
  is called the Schur multiplier of 
 
 
 
 . It can also be interpreted as the quotient group 
 
 
 
 .
I. R. Shafarevich 4 has proved that the difference between the relation rank

 
  of 
 
 
 
  and the generator rank

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is given by the minimal number of generators of the Schur multiplier of 
 
 
 
 , that is 
 
 
 
 .
N. Boston and H. Nover 5 have shown that 
 
 
 
 , for all quotients 
 
 
 
  of p-class 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , of a pro-p group 
 
 
 
  with finite abelianization 
 
 
 
 .
Furthermore, J. Blackhurst (in the appendix On the nucleus of certain p-groups of a paper by N. Boston, M. R. Bush and F. Hajir 6) has proved that a non-cyclic finite p-group 
 
 
 
  with trivial Schur multiplier 
 
 
 
  is a terminal vertex in the descendant tree 
 
 
 
  of the trivial group 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 


 
 .
Examples
:* A finite p-group 
 
 
 
  has a balanced presentation 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 , that is, if and only if its Schur multiplier 
 
 
 
  is trivial. Such a group is called a Schur group and it must be a leaf in the descendant tree 
 
 
 
 .
:*A finite p-group 
 
 
 
  satisfies 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 , that is, if and only if it has a non-trivial cyclic Schur multiplier $M(G)$. Such a group is called a Schur+1 group.
