   Infinitesimal transformation      Infinitesimal transformation   In mathematics , an infinitesimal transformation is a limiting form of small  transformation . For example one may talk about an infinitesimal rotation of a rigid body , in three-dimensional space. This is conventionally represented by a 3×3 skew-symmetric matrix  A . It is not the matrix of an actual rotation in space; but for small real values of a parameter ε      I  +   ε  A       I    ε  A     I+\varepsilon A     a small rotation, up to quantities of order ε 2 .  History  A comprehensive theory of infinitesimal transformations was first given by Sophus Lie . This was at the heart of his work, on what are now called Lie groups and their accompanying Lie algebras ; and the identification of their role in geometry and especially the theory of differential equations . The properties of an abstract Lie algebra are exactly those definitive of infinitesimal transformations, just as the axioms of group theory embody symmetry . The term "Lie algebra" was introduced in 1934 by Hermann Weyl , for what had until then been known as the algebra of infinitesimal transformations of a Lie group.  Examples  For example, in the case of infinitesimal rotations, the Lie algebra structure is that provided by the cross product , once a skew-symmetric matrix has been identified with a 3- vector . This amounts to choosing an axis vector for the rotations; the defining Jacobi identity is a well-known property of cross products.  The earliest example of an infinitesimal transformation that may have been recognised as such was in Euler's theorem on homogeneous functions . Here it is stated that a function F of n variables x 1 , ..., x n that is homogeneous of degree r , satisfies       Θ  F   =   r   F          normal-Θ  F     r  F     \Theta F=rF\,     with       Θ  =    ∑  i     x  i    ∂   ∂   x  i        ,      normal-Θ    subscript   i      subscript  x  i         subscript  x  i         \Theta=\sum_{i}x_{i}{\partial\over\partial x_{i}},     the Theta operator . That is, from the property       F   (   λ   x  1    ,  …  ,   λ   x  n    )    =    λ  r   F   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )          F     λ   subscript  x  1    normal-…    λ   subscript  x  n         superscript  λ  r   F    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       F(\lambda x_{1},\dots,\lambda x_{n})=\lambda^{r}F(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})\,     it is possible to differentiate with respect to λ and then set λ equal to 1. This then becomes a necessary condition on a smooth function  F to have the homogeneity property; it is also sufficient (by using Schwartz distributions one can reduce the mathematical analysis considerations here). This setting is typical, in that there is a one-parameter group of scalings operating; and the information is coded in an infinitesimal transformation that is a first-order differential operator .  Operator version of Taylor's theorem  The operator equation        e   t  D    f   (  x  )    =   f   (   x  +  t   )           superscript  e    t  D    f  x     f    x  t      e^{tD}f(x)=f(x+t)\,     where      D  =   d   d  x        D    d    d  x      D={d\over dx}     is an operator version of Taylor's theorem — and is therefore only valid under caveats about f being an analytic function . Concentrating on the operator part, it shows that D is an infinitesimal transformation, generating translations of the real line via the exponential . In Lie's theory, this is generalised a long way. Any connected Lie group can be built up by means of its infinitesimal generators (a basis for the Lie algebra of the group); with explicit if not always useful information given in the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula .
