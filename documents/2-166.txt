   Fermat number      Fermat number   In mathematics , a Fermat number , named after Pierre de Fermat who first studied them, is a positive integer of the form       F  n   =    2   (   2  n   )    +  1        subscript  F  n      superscript  2   superscript  2  n    1     F_{n}=2^{(2^{n})}+1     where n is a nonnegative integer. The first few Fermat numbers are:   3 , 5 , 17 , 257 , 65537 , 4294967297, 18446744073709551617, … .   If 2 k + 1 is prime , and k > 0, it can be shown that k must be a power of two. (If k = ab where 1 ≤ a , b ≤ k and b is odd, then 2 k + 1 = (2 a ) b + 1 ≡ (−1) b + 1 = 0 ( mod 2 a + 1). See below for a complete proof.) In other words, every prime of the form 2 k + 1 (other than 2 = 2 0 + 1) is a Fermat number, and such primes are called Fermat primes . As of 2015, the only known Fermat primes are F 0 , F 1 , F 2 , F 3 , and F 4 .  Basic properties  The Fermat numbers satisfy the following recurrence relations :       F  n   =     (    F   n  -  1    -  1   )   2   +   1         subscript  F  n      superscript     subscript  F    n  1    1   2   1     F_{n}=(F_{n-1}-1)^{2}+1\!     for n ≥ 1,       F  n   =    F   n  -  1    +    2   2   n  -  1      F  0   ⋯    F   n  -  2            subscript  F  n      subscript  F    n  1       superscript  2   superscript  2    n  1      subscript  F  0   normal-⋯   subscript  F    n  2        F_{n}=F_{n-1}+2^{2^{n-1}}F_{0}\cdots F_{n-2}\!          F  n   =    F   n  -  1   2   -   2     (    F   n  -  2    -  1   )   2           subscript  F  n      superscript   subscript  F    n  1    2     2   superscript     subscript  F    n  2    1   2       F_{n}=F_{n-1}^{2}-2(F_{n-2}-1)^{2}\!          F  n   =     F  0   ⋯   F   n  -  1     +   2         subscript  F  n        subscript  F  0   normal-⋯   subscript  F    n  1     2     F_{n}=F_{0}\cdots F_{n-1}+2\!     for n ≥ 2. Each of these relations can be proved by mathematical induction . From the last equation, we can deduce Goldbach's theorem (named after Christian Goldbach ): no two Fermat numbers share a common integer factor greater than 1 . To see this, suppose that 0 ≤ i  i and F j have a common factor a > 1. Then a divides both       F  0   ⋯   F   j  -  1         subscript  F  0   normal-⋯   subscript  F    j  1      F_{0}\cdots F_{j-1}     and F j ; hence a divides their difference, 2. Since a > 1, this forces a = 2. This is a contradiction , because each Fermat number is clearly odd. As a corollary , we obtain another proof of the infinitude of the prime numbers: for each F n , choose a prime factor p n ; then the sequence { p n } is an infinite sequence of distinct primes.  Further properties:   No Fermat prime can be expressed as the difference of two p th powers, where p is an odd prime.  With the exception of F 0 and F 1 , the last digit of a Fermat number is 7.  The sum of the reciprocals of all the Fermat numbers  is irrational . ( Solomon W. Golomb , 1963)   Primality of Fermat numbers  Fermat numbers and Fermat primes were first studied by Pierre de Fermat, who conjectured (but admitted he could not prove) that all Fermat numbers are prime. Indeed, the first five Fermat numbers F 0 ,..., F 4 are easily shown to be prime. However, this conjecture was refuted by Leonhard Euler in 1732 when he showed that       F  5   =    2   2  5    +  1   =    2  32   +  1   =  4294967297  =   641  ×   6700417.           subscript  F  5      superscript  2   superscript  2  5    1           superscript  2  32   1        4294967297         641  6700417.      F_{5}=2^{2^{5}}+1=2^{32}+1=4294967297=641\times 6700417.\;     Euler proved that every factor of F n must have the form k 2 n +1 + 1 (later improved to k 2 n +2 + 1 by Lucas ).  The fact that 641 is a factor of F 5 can be easily deduced from the equalities 641 = 2 7 ×5+1 and 641 = 2 4 + 5 4 . It follows from the first equality that 2 7 ×5 ≡ −1 (mod 641) and therefore (raising to the fourth power) that 2 28 ×5 4 ≡ 1 (mod 641). On the other hand, the second equality implies that 5 4 ≡ −2 4 (mod 641). These congruences imply that −2 32 ≡ 1 (mod 641).  Fermat was probably aware of the form of the factors later proved by Euler, so it seems curious why he failed to follow through on the straightforward calculation to find the factor. 1 One common explanation is that Fermat made a computational mistake.  There are no other known Fermat primes F n with n > 4. However, little is known about Fermat numbers with large n . 2 In fact, each of the following is an open problem:   Is F n  composite for all n > 4?  Are there infinitely many Fermat primes? ( Eisenstein 1844) 3  Are there infinitely many composite Fermat numbers?  Does a Fermat number exist that is not square-free ?   , it is known that F n is composite for , although amongst these, complete factorizations of F n are known only for , and there are no known prime factors for  and . 4 The largest Fermat number known to be composite is F 3329780 , and its prime factor , a megaprime , was discovered by the PrimeGrid collaboration in July 2014. 5 6  Heuristic arguments for density  There are several probabilistic arguments for estimating the number of Fermat primes. However these arguments give quite different estimates, depending on how much information about Fermat numbers one uses, and some predict no further Fermat primes while others predict infinitely many Fermat primes.  The following heuristic argument suggests there are only finitely many Fermat primes: according to the prime number theorem , the " probability " that a number n is prime is at most A /ln( n ), where A is a fixed constant . Therefore, the total expected number of Fermat primes is at most      A     ∑   n  =  0   ∞      1   ln   F  n           A    superscript   subscript     n  0        1     subscript  F  n        \displaystyle A\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\ln F_{n}}     It should be stressed that this argument is in no way a rigorous proof . For one thing, the argument assumes that Fermat numbers behave " randomly ", yet we have already seen that the factors of Fermat numbers have special properties. For example, a similar argument applied to the numbers of the form 2 n +1 suggests that infinitely many of them should be prime, which would mean that there are an infinite number of Fermat primes (though much the same argument applied to the numbers 2 n suggests the ridiculous result that infinitely many of them should be prime, so such probability arguments should not be taken too seriously).  If (more sophisticatedly) we regard the conditional probability that n is prime, given that we know all its prime factors exceed B , as at most A ln( B )/ln( n ), then using Euler's theorem that the least prime factor of F n exceeds , we would find instead      A     ∑   n  =  0   ∞       ln   2   n  +  1      ln   F  n           A    superscript   subscript     n  0           superscript  2    n  1        subscript  F  n        \displaystyle A\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\ln 2^{n+1}}{\ln F_{n}}     Although such arguments engender the belief that there are only finitely many Fermat primes, one can also produce arguments for the opposite conclusion. Suppose we regard the conditional probability that n is prime, given that we know all its prime factors are 1 modulo M , as at least CM /ln( n ). Then using Euler's result that M = 2 n + 1 we would find that the expected total number of Fermat primes was at least      C     ∑   n  =  0   ∞       2   n  +  1     ln   F  n           C    superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript  2    n  1       subscript  F  n        \displaystyle C\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{2^{n+1}}{\ln F_{n}}     and indeed this argument predicts that an asymptotically constant fraction of Fermat numbers are prime.  Equivalent conditions of primality  Let     F  n   =    2   2  n    +  1        subscript  F  n      superscript  2   superscript  2  n    1     F_{n}=2^{2^{n}}+1   be the n th Fermat number. Pépin's test states that for n > 0,      F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   is prime if and only if      3    (    F  n   -  1   )   /  2    ≡    -  1      (   mod   F  n    )     .       superscript  3       subscript  F  n   1   2     annotated    1    pmod   subscript  F  n       3^{(F_{n}-1)/2}\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}F_{n}).   The expression    3    (    F  n   -  1   )   /  2      superscript  3       subscript  F  n   1   2     3^{(F_{n}-1)/2}   can be evaluated modulo    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   by repeated squaring . This makes the test a fast polynomial-time algorithm. However, Fermat numbers grow so rapidly that only a handful of Fermat numbers can be tested in a reasonable amount of time and space.  There some tests that can be used to test numbers of the form k 2 m + 1, such as factors of Fermat numbers, for primality.   Proth's theorem (1878)—Let N = k 2 m + 1 with odd k  m . If there is an integer a such that          a    (   N  -  1   )   /  2    ≡    -  1       (   mod  N   )          superscript  a      N  1   2     annotated    1    pmod  N      a^{(N-1)/2}\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}N)\!         then N is prime. Conversely, if the above congruence does not hold, and in addition          (   a  N   )   =   -   1          a  N     1     \left(\frac{a}{N}\right)=-1\!   (See Jacobi symbol )      then N is composite. If N = F n > 3, then the above Jacobi symbol is always equal to −1 for a = 3, and this special case of Proth's theorem is known as Pépin's test . Although Pépin's test and Proth's theorem have been implemented on computers to prove the compositeness of some Fermat numbers, neither test gives a specific nontrivial factor. In fact, no specific prime factors are known for n = 20 and 24.   Factorization of Fermat numbers  Because of the size of Fermat numbers, it is difficult to factorize or even to check primality. Pépin's test gives a necessary and sufficient condition for primality of Fermat numbers, and can be implemented by modern computers. The elliptic curve method is a fast method for finding small prime divisors of numbers. Distributed computing project Fermatsearch has successfully found some factors of Fermat numbers. Yves Gallot's proth.exe has been used to find factors of large Fermat numbers. Édouard Lucas , improving the above-mentioned result by Euler, proved in 1878 that every factor of Fermat number    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   , with n at least 2, is of the form     k  ×   2   n  +  2     +  1        k   superscript  2    n  2     1    k\times 2^{n+2}+1   (see Proth number ), where k is a positive integer. By itself, this makes it easy to prove the primality of the known Fermat primes.

This is because all strong pseudoprimes to base 2 are also Fermat pseudoprimes - i.e.       2    F  n   -  1    ≡   1     (   mod   F  n    )         superscript  2     subscript  F  n   1     annotated  1   pmod   subscript  F  n       2^{F_{n}-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}F_{n})\,\!     for all Fermat numbers.  In 1964, Rotkiewicz showed that the product of at least two prime or composite Fermat numbers will be a Fermat pseudoprime to base 2.  Selfridge's Conjecture  John L. Selfridge made an intriguing conjecture. Let g ( n ) be the number of distinct prime factors of . Then g ( n ) is not monotonic (nondecreasing). If another Fermat prime exists, that would imply the conjecture. 10  Other theorems about Fermat numbers  '''Lemma: If n is a positive integer, '''         a  n   -   b  n    =    (   a  -  b   )     ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1      a  k    b   n  -  1  -  k        .         superscript  a  n    superscript  b  n        a  b     superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1       superscript  a  k    superscript  b    n  1  k         a^{n}-b^{n}=(a-b)\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}a^{k}b^{n-1-k}.

Because    1  <    2  r   +  1   <    2  k   +  1         1     superscript  2  r   1           superscript  2  k   1      1<2^{r}+1<2^{k}+1   , it follows that     2  k   +  1       superscript  2  k   1    2^{k}+1   is not prime. Therefore, by contraposition   k   k   k   must be a power of 2.  Theorem: A Fermat prime cannot be a Wieferich prime .  Proof: We show if    p  =    2  m   +  1       p     superscript  2  m   1     p=2^{m}+1   is a Fermat prime (and hence by the above, m is a power of 2), then the congruence     2   p  -  1    ≡   1     (   mod   p  2    )         superscript  2    p  1     annotated  1   pmod   superscript  p  2       2^{p-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p^{2})   does not hold.  It is easy to show    2  m  |  p  -  1     fragments  2  m  normal-|  p   1    2m|p-1   . Now write     p  -  1   =   2  m  λ         p  1     2  m  λ     p-1=2m\lambda   . If the given congruence holds, then     p  2   |   2   2  m  λ    -  1     fragments   superscript  p  2   normal-|   superscript  2    2  m  λ     1    p^{2}|2^{2m\lambda}-1   , and therefore       0  ≡    (    2   2  m  λ    -  1   )   /   (    2  m   +  1   )    =    (    2  m   -  1   )    (   1  +   2   2  m    +   2   4  m    +  …  +   2   2   (   λ  -  1   )   m     )    ≡    -   2  λ       (   mod    2  m   +  1    )     .        0       superscript  2    2  m  λ    1      superscript  2  m   1              superscript  2  m   1     1   superscript  2    2  m     superscript  2    4  m    normal-…   superscript  2    2    λ  1   m            annotated      2  λ     pmod     superscript  2  m   1        0\equiv(2^{2m\lambda}-1)/(2^{m}+1)=(2^{m}-1)(1+2^{2m}+2^{4m}+...+2^{2(\lambda-%
 1)m})\equiv-2\lambda\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}2^{m}+1).     Hence     2  m   +  1  |  2  λ     fragments   superscript  2  m    1  normal-|  2  λ    2^{m}+1|2\lambda   ,and therefore     2  λ   ≥    2  m   +  1         2  λ      superscript  2  m   1     2\lambda\geq 2^{m}+1   . This leads to       p  -  1   ≥   m   (    2  m   +  1   )          p  1     m     superscript  2  m   1      p-1\geq m(2^{m}+1)   , which is impossible since    m  ≥  2      m  2    m\geq 2   .  A theorem of Édouard Lucas : Any prime divisor p of F n =     2   2    𝑛     +  1       superscript  2   superscript  2   n  absent     1    2^{2^{\overset{n}{}}}+1   is of the form     k   2   n  +  2     +  1        k   superscript  2    n  2     1    k2^{n+2}+1   whenever n is greater than one.  Sketch of proof:  Let G p denote the group of non-zero elements of the integers (mod p ) under multiplication, which has order p-1 . Notice that 2 (strictly speaking, its image (mod p )) has multiplicative order dividing    2   n  +  1      superscript  2    n  1     2^{n+1}   in G p (since    2   2     n  +  1        superscript  2   superscript  2     n  1   absent      2^{2^{\overset{n+1}{}}}   is the square of    2   2    𝑛       superscript  2   superscript  2   n  absent      2^{2^{\overset{n}{}}}   which is -1 mod F n ), so that, by Lagrange's theorem , p-1 is divisible by    2   n  +  1      superscript  2    n  1     2^{n+1}   and p has the form     k   2   n  +  1     +  1        k   superscript  2    n  1     1    k2^{n+1}+1   for some integer k , as Euler knew. Édouard Lucas went further. Since n is greater than 1 , the prime p above is congruent to 1 (mod 8 ). Hence (as was known to Carl Friedrich Gauss ), 2 is a quadratic residue (mod p ), that is, there is integer a such that a 2 -2 is divisible by p . Then the image of a has order    2   n  +  2      superscript  2    n  2     2^{n+2}   in the group G p and (using Lagrange's theorem again), p-1 is divisible by    2   n  +  2      superscript  2    n  2     2^{n+2}   and p has the form     s   2   n  +  2     +  1        s   superscript  2    n  2     1    s2^{n+2}+1   for some integer s .  In fact, it can be seen directly that 2 is a quadratic residue (mod p ), since      (   1  +   2   2   n  -  1      )   2   ≡   2   1  +   2   n  -  1           superscript    1   superscript  2   superscript  2    n  1      2    superscript  2    1   superscript  2    n  1        (1+2^{2^{n-1}})^{2}\equiv 2^{1+2^{n-1}}   (mod p ). Since an odd power of 2 is a quadratic residue (mod p ), so is 2 itself.  Relationship to constructible polygons  An n -sided regular polygon can be constructed with compass and straightedge if and only if n is the product of a power of 2 and distinct Fermat primes: in other words, if and only if n is of the form n = 2 k p 1 p 2 … p s , where k is a nonnegative integer and the p i are distinct Fermat primes.  A positive integer n is of the above form if and only if its totient φ( n ) is a power of 2.  Applications of Fermat numbers  Pseudorandom Number Generation  Fermat primes are particularly useful in generating pseudo-random sequences of numbers in the range 1 … N , where N is a power of 2. The most common method used is to take any seed value between 1 and P − 1, where P is a Fermat prime. Now multiply this by a number A , which is greater than the square root of P and is a primitive root modulo P (i.e., it is not a quadratic residue ). Then take the result modulo P . The result is the new value for the RNG.       V   j  +  1    =    (   A  ×   V  j    )   mod  P        subscript  V    j  1     modulo    A   subscript  V  j    P     V_{j+1}=\left(A\times V_{j}\right)\bmod P   (see Linear congruential generator , RANDU ) This is useful in computer science since most data structures have members with 2 X possible values. For example, a byte has 256 (2 8 ) possible values (0–255). Therefore to fill a byte or bytes with random values a random number generator which produces values 1–256 can be used, the byte taking the output value − 1. Very large Fermat primes are of particular interest in data encryption for this reason. This method produces only pseudorandom values as, after P − 1 repetitions, the sequence repeats. A poorly chosen multiplier can result in the sequence repeating sooner than P − 1.  Other interesting facts  A Fermat number cannot be a perfect number or part of a pair of amicable numbers .  The series of reciprocals of all prime divisors of Fermat numbers is convergent .  If n n + 1 is prime, there exists an integer m such that n = 2 2 m . The equation n n + 1 = F (2 m + m ) holds at that time. 11  Let the largest prime factor of Fermat number F n be P ( F n ). Then,       P   (   F  n   )    ≥     2   n  +  2     (    4  n   +  9   )    +  1.         P   subscript  F  n         superscript  2    n  2        4  n   9    1.     P(F_{n})\geq 2^{n+2}(4n+9)+1.     Generalized Fermat numbers  Numbers of the form     a   2    𝑛     +   b   2    𝑛          superscript  a   superscript  2   n  absent      superscript  b   superscript  2   n  absent       a^{2^{\overset{n}{}}}+b^{2^{\overset{n}{}}}   with a , b any coprime integers, a > b > 0, are called generalized Fermat numbers . An odd prime p is a generalized Fermat number if and only if p is congruent to 1 (mod 4) . (Here we consider only the case n > 0, so 3 =     2   2  0    +  1       superscript  2   superscript  2  0    1    2^{2^{0}}+1   is not a counterexample.)  By analogy with the ordinary Fermat numbers, it is common to write generalized Fermat numbers of the form     a   2    𝑛     +  1       superscript  a   superscript  2   n  absent     1    a^{2^{\overset{n}{}}}+1   as F n ( a ). In this notation, for instance, the number 100,000,001 would be written as F 3 (10). In the following we shall restrict ourselves to primes of this form,     a   2    𝑛     +  1       superscript  a   superscript  2   n  absent     1    a^{2^{\overset{n}{}}}+1   .  If we require n >0, then Landau's fourth problem asks if there are infinitely many generalized Fermat primes F n ( a ).  Generalized Fermat primes  Because of the ease of proving their primality, generalized Fermat primes have become in recent years a hot topic for research within the field of number theory. Many of the largest known primes today are generalized Fermat primes.  Generalized Fermat numbers can be prime only for even  a , because if a is odd then every generalized Fermat number will be divisible by 2. The smallest prime number F n ( a ) with n > 4 is F 5 (30), or 30 32 +1. Besides, we can define "half generalized Fermat numbers" for an odd base, a half generalized Fermat number to base a (for odd a ) is      a   2  n    +  1   2         superscript  a   superscript  2  n    1   2    \frac{a^{2^{n}}+1}{2}   , and it is also to be expected that there will be only finitely many half generalized Fermat primes for each odd base.  (In the list, the generalized Fermat numbers to an even a are     a   2  n    +  1       superscript  a   superscript  2  n    1    a^{2^{n}}+1   , for odd a , they are      a   2  n    +  1   2         superscript  a   superscript  2  n    1   2    \frac{a^{2^{n}}+1}{2}   . If a is an perfect power with an odd exponent , then all generalized Fermat number can be algrabic factored, so they cannot be prime)      a   n which F n ( a ) is prime   a   n which F n ( a ) is prime   a   n which F n ( a ) is prime   a   n which F n ( a ) is prime     2   0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...   18   0, ...   34   2, ...   50   ...     3   0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, ...   19   1, ...   35   1, 2, 6, ...   51   1, 3, 6, ...     4   0, 1, 2, 3, ...   20   1, 2, ...   36   0, 1, ...   52   0, ...     5   0, 1, 2, ...   21   0, 2, 5, ...   37   0, ...   53   3, ...     6   0, 1, 2, ...   22   0, ...   38   ...   54   1, 2, 5, ...     7   2, ...   23   2, ...   39   1, 2, ...   55   ...     8   None (8 = 2 3 )   24   1, 2, ...   40   0, 1, ...   56   1, 2, ...     9   0, 1, 3, 4, 5, ...   25   0, 1, ...   41   4, ...   57   0, 2, ...     10   0, 1, ...   26   1, ...   42   0, ...   58   0, ...     11   1, 2, ...   27   None (27 = 3 3 )   43   3, ...   59   1, ...     12   0, ...   28   0, 2, ...   44   4, ...   60   0, ...     13   0, 2, 3, ...   29   1, 2, 4, ...   45   0, 1, ...   61   0, 1, 2, ...     14   1, ...   30   0, 5, ...   46   0, 2, 9, ...   62   ...     15   1, ...   31   ...   47   3, ...   63   ...     16   0, 1, 2, ...   32   None (32 = 2 5 )   48   2, ...   64   None (64 = 4 3 )     17   2, ...   33   0, 3, ...   49   1, ...   65   1, 2, 5, ...
