Glucuronoxylan 4-O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a glucuronoxylan 4-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + glucuronoxylan D-glucuronate 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + glucuronoxylan 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and glucuronoxylan D-glucuronate, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and glucuronoxylan 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:glucuronoxylan-D-glucuronate 4-O-methyltransferase.
