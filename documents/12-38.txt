The half-normal distribution is a special case of the folded normal distribution.
Let 
 
 
 
  follow an ordinary normal distribution, 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  follows a half-normal distribution. Thus, the half-normal distribution is a fold at the mean of an ordinary normal distribution with mean zero.
Using the 
 
 
 
 
  parametrization of the normal distribution, the probability density function (PDF) of the half-normal is given by


 
 ,
Where 
 
 
 
 .
Alternatively using a scaled precision (inverse of the variance) parametrization (to avoid issues if 
 
 
 
  is near zero), obtained by setting 
 
 
 
 , the probability density function is given by


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
 .
The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is given by



Using the change-of-variables 
 
 
 
 , the CDF can be written as


 
  where erf(x) is the error function, a standard function in many mathematical software packages.
The quantile function (or inverse CDF) is written:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the inverse error function
The expectation is then given by



The variance is given by



Since this is proportional to the variance σ2 of X, σ can be seen as a scale parameter of the new distribution.
The entropy of the half-normal distribution is exactly one bit less the entropy of a zero-mean normal distribution with the same second moment about 0. This can be understood intuitively since the magnitude operator reduces information by one bit (if the probability distribution at its input is even). Alternatively, since a half-normal distribution is always positive, the one bit it would take to record whether a standard normal random variable were positive (say, a 1) or negative (say, a 0) is no longer necessary. Thus,

Parameter estimation
Given numbers 
 
 
 
  drawn from a half-normal distribution, the unknown parameter 
 
 
 
  of that distribution can be estimated by the method of maximum likelihood, giving
