   Closed immersion      Closed immersion    For the same-name concept in differential geometry, see immersion (mathematics) .    In algebraic geometry , a closed immersion of schemes is a morphism of schemes     f  :   Z  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  Z  X     f:Z\to X   that identifies Z as a closed subset of X such that regular functions on Z can be extended locally to X . 1 The latter condition can be formalized by saying that     f  #   :    𝒪  X   →    f  ∗    𝒪  Z        normal-:   superscript  f  normal-#    normal-→   subscript  𝒪  X      subscript  f  normal-∗    subscript  𝒪  Z       f^{\#}:\mathcal{O}_{X}\rightarrow f_{\ast}\mathcal{O}_{Z}   is surjective. 2  An example is the inclusion map     Spec   (   R  /  I   )    →   Spec   (  R  )       normal-→   Spec    R  I     Spec  R     \operatorname{Spec}(R/I)\to\operatorname{Spec}(R)   induced by the canonical map    R  →   R  /  I      normal-→  R    R  I     R\to R/I   .  Other characterizations  The following are equivalent:       f  :   Z  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  Z  X     f:Z\to X   is a closed immersion.  For every open affine    U  =   Spec   (  R  )    ⊂  X        U   Spec  R        X     U=\operatorname{Spec}(R)\subset X   , there exists an ideal    I  ⊂  R      I  R    I\subset R   such that      f   -  1     (  U  )    =   Spec   (   R  /  I   )           superscript  f    1    U    Spec    R  I      f^{-1}(U)=\operatorname{Spec}(R/I)   as schemes over U .  There exists an open affine covering     X  =   ⋃   U  j     ,    U  j   =   Spec   R  j        formulae-sequence    X     subscript  U  j        subscript  U  j    Spec   subscript  R  j       X=\bigcup U_{j},U_{j}=\operatorname{Spec}R_{j}   and for each j there exists an ideal     I  j   ⊂   R  j        subscript  I  j    subscript  R  j     I_{j}\subset R_{j}   such that      f   -  1     (   U  j   )    =   Spec   (    R  j   /   I  j    )           superscript  f    1     subscript  U  j     Spec     subscript  R  j    subscript  I  j       f^{-1}(U_{j})=\operatorname{Spec}(R_{j}/I_{j})   as schemes over    U  j     subscript  U  j    U_{j}   .  There is a quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals   ℐ   ℐ   \mathcal{I}   on X such that      f  ∗    𝒪  Z    ≅    𝒪  X   /  ℐ          subscript  f  normal-∗    subscript  𝒪  Z       subscript  𝒪  X   ℐ     f_{\ast}\mathcal{O}_{Z}\cong\mathcal{O}_{X}/\mathcal{I}   and f is an isomorphism of Z onto the global Spec of     𝒪  X   /  ℐ       subscript  𝒪  X   ℐ    \mathcal{O}_{X}/\mathcal{I}   over X .   Properties  A closed immersion is finite and radicial (universally injective). In particular, a closed immersion is universally closed. A closed immersion is stable under base change and composition. The notion of a closed immersion is local in the sense that f is a closed immersion if and only if for some (equivalently every) open covering    X  =   ⋃   U  j        X     subscript  U  j      X=\bigcup U_{j}   the induced map    f  :     f   -  1     (   U  j   )    →   U  j       normal-:  f   normal-→     superscript  f    1     subscript  U  j     subscript  U  j      f:f^{-1}(U_{j})\rightarrow U_{j}   is a closed immersion. 3 4  If the composition    Z  →  Y  →  X       normal-→  Z  Y    normal-→    X     Z\to Y\to X   is a closed immersion and    Y  →  X     normal-→  Y  X    Y\to X   is separated , then    Z  →  Y     normal-→  Z  Y    Z\to Y   is a closed immersion. If X is a separated S -scheme, then every S - section of X is a closed immersion. 5  If    i  :   Z  →  X      normal-:  i   normal-→  Z  X     i:Z\to X   is a closed immersion and    ℐ  ⊂   𝒪  X       ℐ   subscript  𝒪  X     \mathcal{I}\subset\mathcal{O}_{X}   is the quasi-coherent sheaf of ideals cutting out Z , then the direct image    i  *     subscript  i     i_{*}   from the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over Z to the category of quasi-coherent sheaves over X is exact, fully faithful with the essential image consisting of   𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}   such that     ℐ  𝒢   =  0        ℐ  𝒢   0    \mathcal{I}\mathcal{G}=0   . 6  A flat closed immersion of finite presentation is the open immersion of an open closed subscheme. 7  See also   Segre embedding  Regular embedding   Notes  References    The Stacks Project    "  Category:Morphisms of schemes     Mumford, The red book of varieties and schemes , Section II.5 ↩  ↩  ↩  http://stacks.math.columbia.edu/download/spaces-morphisms.pdf ↩  ↩  Stacks, Morphisms of schemes.
