6-phospho-beta-galactosidase




6-phospho-beta-galactosidase

In enzymology, a 6-phospho-beta-galactosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a 6-phospho-beta-D-galactoside + H2O 
 
 
 
  6-phospho-D-galactose + an alcohol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-phospho-beta-D-galactoside and H2O, whereas its two products are 6-phospho-D-galactose and alcohol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-phospho-beta-D-galactoside 6-phosphogalactohydrolase. Other names in common use include phospho-beta-galactosidase, beta-D-phosphogalactoside galactohydrolase, phospho-beta-D-galactosidase, and 6-phospho-beta-D-galactosidase. This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism.
