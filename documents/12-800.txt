   McLaughlin sporadic group      McLaughlin sporadic group   In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the McLaughlin group  McL is a sporadic simple group of order   2 7 · 3 6 · 5 3 · 7 · 11 = 898128000  ≈ 9     ×   10  8       absent   superscript  10  8     \times 10^{8}   .   History and properties  McL is one of the 26 sporadic groups and was discovered by  as an index 2 subgroup of a rank 3 permutation group acting on the McLaughlin graph with 275 = 1 + 112 + 162 vertices. It fixes a 2-2-3 triangle in the Leech lattice so is a subgroup of the Conway groups . Its Schur multiplier has order 3, and its outer automorphism group has order 2. The group 3.McL.2 is a maximal subgroup of the Lyons group .  McL has one conjugacy class of involution (element of order 2), whose centralizer is a maximal subgroup of type 2.A 8 . This has a center of order 2; the quotient modulo the center is isomorphic to the alternating group A 8 .  Representations  In the Conway group Co 3 , McL has the normalizer McL:2, which is maximal in Co 3 .  McL is the only sporadic group to admit irreducible representations of quaternionic type . It has 2 such representations, one of dimension 3520 and one of dimension 4752.  Generalized Monstrous Moonshine  Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For the Conway groups , the relevant McKay-Thompson series is     T   2  A     (  τ  )        subscript  T    2  A    τ    T_{2A}(\tau)   and     T   4  A     (  τ  )        subscript  T    4  A    τ    T_{4A}(\tau)   .  Maximal subgroups  found the 12 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of of McL as follows:   U 4 (3) order 3,265,920 index 275 - point stabilizer of its action on the McLaughlin graph  M 22 order 443,520 index 2,025 (Two classes, fused under an outer automorphism).
