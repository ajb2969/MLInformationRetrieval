   Graph algebra      Graph algebra   In mathematics , especially in the fields of universal algebra and graph theory , a graph algebra is a way of giving a directed graph an algebraic structure . It was introduced in , and has seen many uses in the field of universal algebra since then.  Definition  Let    D  =   (  V  ,  E  )       D   V  E     D=(V,E)   be a directed graph , and   0   0    an element not in   V   V   V   . The graph algebra associated with   D   D   D   is the set    V  ∪   {  0  }       V   0     V\cup\{0\}   equipped with multiplication defined by the rules        x  y   =  x        x  y   x    xy=x   if      x  ,  y   ∈  V   ,    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈  E      formulae-sequence     x  y   V      x  y   E     x,y\in V,(x,y)\in E          x  y   =  0        x  y   0    xy=0   if      x  ,  y   ∈   V  ∪   {  0  }     ,    (  x  ,  y  )   ∉  E      formulae-sequence     x  y     V   0        x  y   E     x,y\in V\cup\{0\},(x,y)\notin E   .   Applications  This notion has made it possible to use the methods of graph theory in universal algebra and several other directions of discrete mathematics and computer science. Graph algebras have been used, for example, in constructions concerning dualities , equational theories , flatness , groupoid  rings , topologies , varieties , finite state automata , finite state machines , tree languages and tree automata etc.  See also   Group algebra  Incidence algebra  Path algebra   References                Further reading     "  Category:Universal algebra  Category:Graph theory
