Graph algebra

In mathematics, especially in the fields of universal algebra and graph theory, a graph algebra is a way of giving a directed graph an algebraic structure. It was introduced in , and has seen many uses in the field of universal algebra since then.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a directed graph, and 
 
 
 
  an element not in 
 
 
 
 . The graph algebra associated with 
 
 
 
  is the set 
 
 
 
  equipped with multiplication defined by the rules



 
  if 
 
 



 
  if 
 
 
 
 .

Applications
This notion has made it possible to use the methods of graph theory in universal algebra and several other directions of discrete mathematics and computer science. Graph algebras have been used, for example, in constructions concerning dualities , equational theories , flatness , groupoid rings , topologies , varieties , finite state automata , finite state machines , tree languages and tree automata  etc.
