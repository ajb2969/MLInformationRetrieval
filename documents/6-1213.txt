   Clélie      Clélie   (Figure)  Some examples of the curve   In mathematics , a Clélie or Clelia curve is a curve parameterized by 1      x  =   a   sin   (   m  θ   )     cos   (  θ  )         x    a      m  θ      θ      x=a\sin(m\theta)\cos(\theta)         y  =   a   sin   (   m  θ   )     sin   (  θ  )         y    a      m  θ      θ      y=a\sin(m\theta)\sin(\theta)         z  =   a   cos   (   m  θ   )         z    a      m  θ       z=a\cos(m\theta)     A curve of this type is confined to the surface of a sphere of radius   a   a   a   , 2 as is obvious from the parametric equations for the surface of a sphere. When    m  =  1      m  1    m=1   , this is Viviani's curve .  The curve was named by Luigi Guido Grandi 3 after Clelia Borromeo . 4  References  "  Category:Curves     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
