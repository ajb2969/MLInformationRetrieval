   Lévy hierarchy      Lévy hierarchy   In set theory and mathematical logic , the Lévy hierarchy , introduced by Azriel Lévy in 1965, is a hierarchy of formulas in the formal language of the Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory , which is typically called just the language of set theory. This is analogous to the arithmetical hierarchy which provides the classifications but for sentences of the language of arithmetic.  Definitions  In the language of set theory, atomic formulas are of the form x = y or x ∈ y, standing for equality and respectively set membership predicates.  The first level of the Levy hierarchy is defined as containing only formulas with no unbounded quantifiers, and is denoted by     Δ  0   =   Σ  0   =   Π  0          subscript  normal-Δ  0    subscript  normal-Σ  0         subscript  normal-Π  0      \Delta_{0}=\Sigma_{0}=\Pi_{0}   . 1 The next levels are given by finding an equivalent formula in Prenex normal form , and counting the number of changes of quantifiers :  In the theory ZFC, a formula   A   A   A   is called: 2     Σ   i  +  1      subscript  normal-Σ    i  1     \Sigma_{i+1}   if   A   A   A   is equivalent to    ∃    x  1   …   ∃    x  n   B            subscript  x  1   normal-…       subscript  x  n   B       \exists x_{1}...\exists x_{n}B   in ZFC, where   B   B   B   is    Π  i     subscript  normal-Π  i    \Pi_{i}       Π   i  +  1      subscript  normal-Π    i  1     \Pi_{i+1}   if   A   A   A   is equivalent to    ∀    x  1   …   ∀    x  n   B        for-all     subscript  x  1   normal-…   for-all     subscript  x  n   B       \forall x_{1}...\forall x_{n}B   in ZFC, where   B   B   B   is    Σ  i     subscript  normal-Σ  i    \Sigma_{i}     If a formula is both    Σ  i     subscript  normal-Σ  i    \Sigma_{i}   and    Π  i     subscript  normal-Π  i    \Pi_{i}   , it is called    Δ  i     subscript  normal-Δ  i    \Delta_{i}   . As a formula might have several different equivalent formulas in Prenex normal form, it might belong to several different levels of the hierarchy. In this case, the lowest possible level is the level of the formula.  The Lévy hierarchy is sometimes defined for other theories S . In this case    Σ  i     subscript  normal-Σ  i    \Sigma_{i}   and    Π  i     subscript  normal-Π  i    \Pi_{i}   by themselves refer only to formulas that start with a sequence of quantifiers with at most i −1 alternations, and    Σ  i  S     superscript   subscript  normal-Σ  i   S    \Sigma_{i}^{S}   and    Π  i  S     superscript   subscript  normal-Π  i   S    \Pi_{i}^{S}   refer to formulas equivalent to    Σ  i     subscript  normal-Σ  i    \Sigma_{i}   and    Π  i     subscript  normal-Π  i    \Pi_{i}   formulas in the theory S . So strictly speaking the levels    Σ  i     subscript  normal-Σ  i    \Sigma_{i}   and    Π  i     subscript  normal-Π  i    \Pi_{i}   of the Lévy hierarchy for ZFC defined above should be denoted by    Σ  i   Z  F  C      subscript   superscript  normal-Σ    Z  F  C    i    \Sigma^{ZFC}_{i}   and    Π  i   Z  F  C      subscript   superscript  normal-Π    Z  F  C    i    \Pi^{ZFC}_{i}   .
