   Triple system      Triple system   In algebra , a triple system (or ternar ) is a vector space  V over a field F together with a F -trilinear map        (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )   :    V  ×  V  ×  V   →  V    .     normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→    V  V  V   V     (\cdot,\cdot,\cdot)\colon V\times V\times V\to V.   The most important examples are Lie triple systems and Jordan triple systems . They were introduced by Nathan Jacobson in 1949 to study subspaces of associative algebras closed under triple commutators [[ u , v ], w ] and triple anticommutators { u , { v , w }}. In particular, any Lie algebra defines a Lie triple system and any Jordan algebra defines a Jordan triple system. They are important in the theories of symmetric spaces , particularly Hermitian symmetric spaces and their generalizations ( symmetric R-spaces and their noncompact duals).  Lie triple systems  A triple system is said to be a Lie triple system if the trilinear form, denoted [.,.,.], satisfies the following identities:       [  u  ,  v  ,  w  ]   =   -   [  v  ,  u  ,  w  ]         u  v  w      v  u  w      [u,v,w]=-[v,u,w]           [  u  ,  v  ,  w  ]   +   [  w  ,  u  ,  v  ]   +   [  v  ,  w  ,  u  ]    =  0         u  v  w    w  u  v    v  w  u    0    [u,v,w]+[w,u,v]+[v,w,u]=0           [  u  ,  v  ,   [  w  ,  x  ,  y  ]   ]   =    [   [  u  ,  v  ,  w  ]   ,  x  ,  y  ]   +   [  w  ,   [  u  ,  v  ,  x  ]   ,  y  ]   +   [  w  ,  x  ,   [  u  ,  v  ,  y  ]   ]     .       u  v   w  x  y        u  v  w   x  y    w   u  v  x   y    w  x   u  v  y       [u,v,[w,x,y]]=[[u,v,w],x,y]+[w,[u,v,x],y]+[w,x,[u,v,y]].   The first two identities abstract the skew symmetry and Jacobi identity for the triple commutator, while the third identity means that the linear map L u , v : V → V , defined by L u , v ( w ) = [ u , v , w ], is a derivation of the triple product. The identity also shows that the space k = span {L u , v : u , v ∈ V } is closed under commutator bracket, hence a Lie algebra.  Writing m in place of V , it follows that      𝔤  :=   𝔨  ⊕  𝔪      assign  𝔤   direct-sum  𝔨  𝔪     \mathfrak{g}:=\mathfrak{k}\oplus\mathfrak{m}   can be made into a Lie algebra with bracket        [   (  L  ,  u  )   ,   (  M  ,  v  )   ]   =   (    [  L  ,  M  ]   +   L   u  ,  v     ,    L   (  v  )    -   M   (  u  )     )    .        L  u    M  v        L  M    subscript  L   u  v         L  v     M  u       [(L,u),(M,v)]=([L,M]+L_{u,v},L(v)-M(u)).   The decomposition of g is clearly a symmetric decomposition for this Lie bracket, and hence if G is a connected Lie group with Lie algebra g and K is a subgroup with Lie algebra k , then G / K is a symmetric space .  Conversely, given a Lie algebra g with such a symmetric decomposition (i.e., it is the Lie algebra of a symmetric space), the triple bracket [[ u , v ], w ] makes m into a Lie triple system.  Jordan triple systems  A triple system is said to be a Jordan triple system if the trilinear form, denoted {.,.,.}, satisfies the following identities:       {  u  ,  v  ,  w  }   =   {  u  ,  w  ,  v  }        u  v  w    u  w  v     \{u,v,w\}=\{u,w,v\}           {  u  ,  v  ,   {  w  ,  x  ,  y  }   }   =     {  w  ,  x  ,   {  u  ,  v  ,  y  }   }   +   {  w  ,   {  u  ,  v  ,  x  }   ,  y  }    -   {   {  v  ,  u  ,  w  }   ,  x  ,  y  }     .       u  v   w  x  y         w  x   u  v  y     w   u  v  x   y      v  u  w   x  y      \{u,v,\{w,x,y\}\}=\{w,x,\{u,v,y\}\}+\{w,\{u,v,x\},y\}-\{\{v,u,w\},x,y\}.   The first identity abstracts the symmetry of the triple anticommutator, while the second identity means that if L u , v : V → V is defined by L u , v ( y ) = { u , v , y } then       [   L   u  ,  v    ,   L   w  ,  x    ]   :=     L   u  ,  v    ∘   L   w  ,  x     -    L   w  ,  x    ∘   L   u  ,  v      =    L   w  ,   {  u  ,  v  ,  x  }     -   L    {  v  ,  u  ,  w  }   ,  x          assign    subscript  L   u  v     subscript  L   w  x          subscript  L   u  v     subscript  L   w  x        subscript  L   w  x     subscript  L   u  v              subscript  L   w   u  v  x      subscript  L    v  u  w   x        [L_{u,v},L_{w,x}]:=L_{u,v}\circ L_{w,x}-L_{w,x}\circ L_{u,v}=L_{w,\{u,v,x\}}-L%
 _{\{v,u,w\},x}   so that the space of linear maps span {L u , v : u , v ∈ V } is closed under commutator bracket, and hence is a Lie algebra g 0 .  Any Jordan triple system is a Lie triple system with respect to the product        [  u  ,  v  ,  w  ]   =    {  u  ,  v  ,  w  }   -   {  v  ,  u  ,  w  }     .       u  v  w      u  v  w    v  u  w      [u,v,w]=\{u,v,w\}-\{v,u,w\}.     A Jordan triple system is said to be positive definite (resp. nondegenerate ) if the bilinear form on V defined by the trace of L u , v is positive definite (resp. nondegenerate). In either case, there is an identification of V with its dual space, and a corresponding involution on g 0 . They induce an involution of      V  ⊕   𝔤  0   ⊕   V  *      direct-sum  V   subscript  𝔤  0    superscript  V      V\oplus\mathfrak{g}_{0}\oplus V^{*}   which in the positive definite case is a Cartan involution. The corresponding symmetric space is a symmetric R-space . It has a noncompact dual given by replacing the Cartan involution by its composite with the involution equal to +1 on g 0 and −1 on V and V * . A special case of this construction arises when g 0 preserves a complex structure on V . In this case we obtain dual Hermitian symmetric spaces of compact and noncompact type (the latter being bounded symmetric domains ).  Jordan pair  A Jordan pair is a generalization of a Jordan triple system involving two vector spaces V + and V − . The trilinear form is then replaced by a pair of trilinear forms        {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }   +   :      V  -   ×   S  2     V  +    →   V  +       normal-:   subscript   normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅      normal-→       subscript  V     superscript  S  2     subscript  V      subscript  V       \{\cdot,\cdot,\cdot\}_{+}\colon V_{-}\times S^{2}V_{+}\to V_{+}           {  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ,  ⋅  }   -   :      V  +   ×   S  2     V  -    →   V  -       normal-:   subscript   normal-⋅  normal-⋅  normal-⋅      normal-→       subscript  V     superscript  S  2     subscript  V      subscript  V       \{\cdot,\cdot,\cdot\}_{-}\colon V_{+}\times S^{2}V_{-}\to V_{-}   which are often viewed as quadratic maps V + → Hom( V − , V + ) and V − → Hom( V + , V − ). The other Jordan axiom (apart from symmetry) is likewise replaced by two axioms, one being        {  u  ,  v  ,    {  w  ,  x  ,  y  }   +   }   +   =      {  w  ,  x  ,    {  u  ,  v  ,  y  }   +   }   +   +    {  w  ,    {  u  ,  v  ,  x  }   +   ,  y  }   +    -     {    {  v  ,  u  ,  w  }   -   ,  x  ,  y  }   +          subscript   u  v   subscript   w  x  y             subscript   w  x   subscript   u  v  y         subscript   w   subscript   u  v  x     y       subscript    subscript   v  u  w     x  y        \{u,v,\{w,x,y\}_{+}\}_{+}=\{w,x,\{u,v,y\}_{+}\}_{+}+\{w,\{u,v,x\}_{+},y\}_{+}-%
 \{\{v,u,w\}_{-},x,y\}_{+}\,   and the other being the analogue with + and − subscripts exchanged.  As in the case of Jordan triple systems, one can define, for u in V − and v in V + , a linear map       L   u  ,  v   +   :     V  +   →    V  +   by       L   u  ,  v   +    (  y  )    =    {  u  ,  v  ,  y  }   +        normal-:   subscript   superscript  L     u  v     formulae-sequence   normal-→   subscript  V      subscript  V    by         subscript   superscript  L     u  v    y    subscript   u  v  y         L^{+}_{u,v}:V_{+}\to V_{+}\quad\text{by}\quad L^{+}_{u,v}(y)=\{u,v,y\}_{+}   and similarly L − . The Jordan axioms (apart from symmetry) may then be written       [   L   u  ,  v   ±   ,   L   w  ,  x   ±   ]   =    L   w  ,    {  u  ,  v  ,  x  }   ±    ±   -   L     {  v  ,  u  ,  w  }   ∓   ,  x   ±          subscript   superscript  L  plus-or-minus    u  v     subscript   superscript  L  plus-or-minus    w  x        subscript   superscript  L  plus-or-minus    w   subscript   u  v  x   plus-or-minus      subscript   superscript  L  plus-or-minus     subscript   v  u  w   minus-or-plus   x       [L^{\pm}_{u,v},L^{\pm}_{w,x}]=L^{\pm}_{w,\{u,v,x\}_{\pm}}-L^{\pm}_{\{v,u,w\}_{%
 \mp},x}   which imply that the images of L + and L − are closed under commutator brackets in End( V + ) and End( V − ). Together they determine a linear map        V  +   ⊗   V  -    →    𝔤  𝔩   (   V  +   )    ⊕   𝔤  𝔩   (   V  -   )        normal-→   tensor-product   subscript  V     subscript  V      direct-sum    𝔤  𝔩   subscript  V       𝔤  𝔩   subscript  V        V_{+}\otimes V_{-}\to\mathfrak{gl}(V_{+})\oplus\mathfrak{gl}(V_{-})   whose image is a Lie subalgebra    𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}   , and the Jordan identities become Jacobi identities for a graded Lie bracket on        V  +   ⊕   𝔤  0   ⊕   V  -    ,     direct-sum   subscript  V     subscript  𝔤  0    subscript  V      V_{+}\oplus\mathfrak{g}_{0}\oplus V_{-},   so that conversely, if      𝔤  =    𝔤   +  1    ⊕   𝔤  0   ⊕   𝔤   -  1         𝔤   direct-sum   subscript  𝔤    1     subscript  𝔤  0    subscript  𝔤    1       \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{g}_{+1}\oplus\mathfrak{g}_{0}\oplus\mathfrak{g}_{-1}   is a graded Lie algebra, then the pair    (   𝔤   +  1    ,   𝔤   -  1    )      subscript  𝔤    1     subscript  𝔤    1      (\mathfrak{g}_{+1},\mathfrak{g}_{-1})   is a Jordan pair, with brackets         {   X  ∓   ,   Y  ±   ,   Z  ±   }   ±   :=   [   [   X  ∓   ,   Y  ±   ]   ,   Z  ±   ]    .     assign   subscript    subscript  X  minus-or-plus    subscript  Y  plus-or-minus    subscript  Z  plus-or-minus    plus-or-minus      subscript  X  minus-or-plus    subscript  Y  plus-or-minus     subscript  Z  plus-or-minus      \{X_{\mp},Y_{\pm},Z_{\pm}\}_{\pm}:=[[X_{\mp},Y_{\pm}],Z_{\pm}].     Jordan triple systems are Jordan pairs with V + = V − and equal trilinear forms. Another important case occurs when V + and V − are dual to one another, with dual trilinear forms determined by an element of        End   (    S  2    V  +    )    ≅      S  2    V  +  *    ⊗   S  2     V  -  *    ≅   End   (    S  2    V  -    )     .          End     superscript  S  2    subscript  V         tensor-product     superscript  S  2    superscript   subscript  V        superscript  S  2     superscript   subscript  V              End     superscript  S  2    subscript  V         \mathrm{End}(S^{2}V_{+})\cong S^{2}V_{+}^{*}\otimes S^{2}V_{-}^{*}\cong\mathrm%
 {End}(S^{2}V_{-}).   These arise in particular when   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   above is semisimple, when the Killing form provides a duality between    𝔤   +  1      subscript  𝔤    1     \mathfrak{g}_{+1}   and    𝔤   -  1      subscript  𝔤    1     \mathfrak{g}_{-1}   .
