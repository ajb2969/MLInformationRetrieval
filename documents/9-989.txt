Reduced residue system




Reduced residue system

Any subset R of the integers is called a reduced residue system modulo n if

gcd(r, n) = 1 for each r contained in R;
R contains φ(n) elements;
no two elements of R are congruent modulo n.12

Here 
 
 
 
  denotes Euler's totient function.
A reduced residue system modulo n can be formed from a complete residue system modulo n by removing all integers not relatively prime to n. For example, a complete residue system modulo 12 is {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11}. 1, 5, 7 and 11 are the only integers in this set which are relatively prime to 12, and so the corresponding reduced residue system modulo 12 is {1,5,7,11}. The cardinality of this set can be calculated with the totient function
 
 
 
 . Some other reduced residue systems modulo 12 are:

{13,17,19,23}
{−11,−7,−5,−1}
{−7,−13,13,31}
{35,43,53,61}

Facts

If  is a reduced residue system with n > 2, then 
 
 
 
 .
Every number in a reduced residue system mod n is a generator for the additive group of integers modulo n.
