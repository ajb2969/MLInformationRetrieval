   Commutator collecting process      Commutator collecting process   In mathematical  group theory , the commutator collecting process is a method for writing an element of a group as a product of generators and their higher commutators arranged in a certain order. The commutator collecting process was introduced by . He called it a "collecting process" though it is also often called a "collection process".  Statement  The commutator collecting process is usually stated for free groups , as a similar theorem then holds for any group by writing it as a quotient of a free group.  Suppose F 1 is a free group on generators a 1 , ..., a m . Define the descending central series by putting   F n +1 = [ F n , F 1 ]   The basic commutators are elements of F 1 defined and ordered as follows.   The basic commutators of weight 1 are the generators a 1 , ..., a m .  The basic commutators of weight w > 1 are the elements [ x , y ] where x and y are basic commutators whose weights sum to w , such that x > y and if x = [ u , v ] for basic commutators u and v then y ≥ v .   Commutators are ordered so that x > y if x has weight greater than that of y , and for commutators of any fixed weight some total ordering is chosen.  Then F n / F n +1 is a fnitely-generated free abelian group with a basis consisting of basic commutators of weight n .  Then any element of F can be written as      g  =    c  1   n  1     c  2   n  2    ⋯   c  k   n  k    c       g     superscript   subscript  c  1    subscript  n  1     superscript   subscript  c  2    subscript  n  2    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  c  k    subscript  n  k    c     g=c_{1}^{n_{1}}c_{2}^{n_{2}}\cdots c_{k}^{n_{k}}c     where the c i are the basic commutators of weight at most m arranged in order, and c is a product of commutators of weight greater than m , and the n i are integers.
