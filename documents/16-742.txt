Homotopy group with coefficients

In topology, a branch of mathematics, for 
 
 
 
 , the i-th homotopy group with coefficients in an abelian group G of a based space X is the pointed set of homotopy classes of based maps from the Moore space of type 
 
 
 
  to X, and is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .1 For 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a group. Note 
 
 
 
  are the usual homotopy groups of X.
