<p>:* I'm reviewing this with the proviso that to a non-physicist like me the article might as well be written in Swahili, so I'm necessarily assuming good faith on its accuracy. Length and date are fine. It's decently written but perhaps a little lightly sourced in a few places (the sources that are used all look fine); in particular I would suggest adding a reference to the end of the para that begins "where

<p>::*I hope the recent edits alleviate your concerns. It's a somewhat advanced topic, difficult for beginning physicists, too. My hope is that the "<a href="spacetime#Privileged_character_of_3+1_spacetime" title="wikilink">four spacetime dimensions is special</a>" portion of the hook will have wider appeal.
