   Monge equation      Monge equation   In the mathematical theory of partial differential equations , a Monge equation , named after Gaspard Monge , is a first-order partial differential equation for an unknown function u in the independent variables x 1 ,..., x n       F   (  u  ,   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   ,    ∂  u    ∂   x  1     ,  …  ,    ∂  u    ∂   x  n     )    =  0        F   u   subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n       u      subscript  x  1     normal-…      u      subscript  x  n       0    F\left(u,x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n},\frac{\partial u}{\partial x_{1}},\dots,\frac%
 {\partial u}{\partial x_{n}}\right)=0     that is a polynomial in the partial derivatives of u . Any Monge equation has a Monge cone .  Classically, putting u = x 0 , a Monge equation of degree k is written in the form        ∑     i  0   +  ⋯  +   i  n    =  k      P    i  0   …   i  n      (   x  0   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  k   )   d    x  0   i  0     d   x  1   i  1    ⋯  d   x  n   i  n      =  0        subscript        subscript  i  0   normal-⋯   subscript  i  n    k       subscript  P     subscript  i  0   normal-…   subscript  i  n       subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  k    d   superscript   subscript  x  0    subscript  i  0    d   superscript   subscript  x  1    subscript  i  1    normal-⋯  d   superscript   subscript  x  n    subscript  i  n      0    \sum_{i_{0}+\cdots+i_{n}=k}P_{i_{0}\dots i_{n}}(x_{0},x_{1},\dots,x_{k})\,dx_{%
 0}^{i_{0}}\,dx_{1}^{i_{1}}\cdots dx_{n}^{i_{n}}=0     and expresses a relation between the differentials  dx k . The Monge cone at a given point ( x 0 , ..., x n ) is the zero locus of the equation in the tangent space at the point.  The Monge equation is unrelated to the (second-order) Monge–Ampère equation .
