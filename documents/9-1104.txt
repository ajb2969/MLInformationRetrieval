Prékopa–Leindler inequality

In mathematics, the Prékopa–Leindler inequality is an integral inequality closely related to the reverse Young's inequality, the Brunn–Minkowski inequality and a number of other important and classical inequalities in analysis. The result is named after the Hungarian mathematicians András Prékopa and László Leindler.
Statement of the inequality
Let 0 n → [0, +∞) be non-negative real-valued measurable functions defined on n-dimensional Euclidean space Rn. Suppose that these functions satisfy
for all x and y in Rn. Then



Essential form of the inequality
Recall that the essential supremum of a measurable function f : Rn → R is defined by



This notation allows the following essential form of the Prékopa–Leindler inequality: let 0 1(Rn; [0, +∞)) be non-negative absolutely integrable functions. Let



Then s is measurable and



The essential supremum form was given in.1 Its use can change the left side of the inequality. For example, a function g that takes the value 1 at exactly one point will not usually yield a zero left side in the "non-essential sup" form but it will always yield a zero left side in the "essential sup" form.
Relationship to the Brunn–Minkowski inequality
It can be shown that the usual Prékopa–Leindler inequality implies the Brunn–Minkowski inequality in the following form: if 0 n such that the Minkowski sum (1 − λ)A + λB is also measurable, then



where μ denotes n-dimensional Lebesgue measure. Hence, the Prékopa–Leindler inequality can also be used2 to prove the Brunn–Minkowski inequality in its more familiar form: if 0 n such that (1 − λ)A + λB is also measurable, then



Applications in probability and statistics
The Prékopa–Leindler inequality is useful in the theory of log-concave distributions, as it can be used to show that log-concavity is preserved by marginalization and independent summation of log-concave distributed random variables. Suppose that H(x,y) is a log-concave distribution for (x,y) ∈ Rm × Rn, so that by definition we have
and let M(y) denote the marginal distribution obtained by integrating over x:



Let y1, y2 ∈ Rn and 0 1 + λy2)'', f(x) = H(x,y1) and g(x) = H(x,y2), so the Prékopa–Leindler inequality applies. It can be written in terms of M as



which is the definition of log-concavity for M.
To see how this implies the preservation of log-convexity by independent sums, suppose that X and Y are independent random variables with log-concave distribution. Since the product of two log-concave functions is log-concave, the joint distribution of (X,Y) is also log-concave. Log-concavity is preserved by affine changes of coordinates, so the distribution of (X+Y,X-Y) is log-concave as well. Since the distribution of X+Y is a marginal over the joint distribution of (X+Y,X-Y), we conclude that X+Y has a log-concave distribution.
