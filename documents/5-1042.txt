Dittography

Dittography is the accidental, erroneous act of repeating a letter, word, phrase or combination of letters by a scribe or copyist.1
Example


98 in Rev 1:13 has περιεζωσμμενον instead of περιεζωσμενον (doubled μ). Codex Vaticanus in John 13:14 word διδασκαλος is repeated twice. In Codex Vaticanus in Acts, a book of the Bible, verse 19:34, the phrase "Great is Artemis of the Ephesians" appears twice while it only appears once in other manuscripts.2
