Observed since 2009 by the Kepler space observatory , it has since been found to possess a planetary system consisting of at least two planets and while it has a similar mass to the Sun (90%) it is significantly older at ten billion years. 6  Kepler-46 b (previously KOI-872.01), was the first planet discovered in the system. It was found through detailed analysis of Kepler space observatory data. An additional planet, Kepler-46 c, was discovered by an outside group using Kepler public data through analysis of transit timing variations . While only one additional planet was confirmed by the analysis, the study revealed the potential existence of either an unconfirmed planet KOI-872.03 (KOI-872 d). Validation by multiplicity method allowed to confirm the existence of this planet which was then renamed Kepler-46d.  Planetary system  Planet b is a superjovian gas giant with 6 times the mass of Jupiter. The second planet in the system was among the first to be discovered through the method of transit timing variations , and through its confirmation of KOI-872 c with a 99% confidence level has shown that the method of detection may be used to detect future extrasolar planets and, possibly, extrasolar moons . 7 This second planet exerted a gravitational force on the first planet, orbiting its host star in just 34 days. While this usually occurs on an extremely regular schedule, additional planets within the system can disrupt the time of the transit, and these disruptions can indicate the presence of a planet, even if the disrupting planet does not pass in front of the host star itself. 8  The data show that Kepler-46 c is an approximately Saturn-mass object with an orbital period of 57 days. 9 As the planet does not itself transit its host star, there is no way of knowing its size (probably a similar size to its sibling). The measurements also suggest the existence of another planet orbiting with a period of about 6.8 days, but this planet is unconfirmed. 10  The method in which the planet was detected is similar to the way that the planet Neptune was discovered, in which the newly discovered planet is known by its pull on another which is already known to exist. 11    References  Notes  "  Category:Lyra (constellation)  Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard  Category:Exoplanets  Category:Kepler Objects of Interest  Category:Planetary transit variables       This measurement indicates the log 10 of the relative abundance of iron in the measured star to that of the Sun. ↩    ↩  ↩     ↩
