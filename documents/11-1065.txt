   Aminolevulinate transaminase      Aminolevulinate transaminase   In enzymology , an aminolevulinate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-aminolevulinate + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4,5-dioxopentanoate + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-aminolevulinate and pyruvate , whereas its two products are 4,5-dioxopentanoate and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-aminolevulinate:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include aminolevulinate aminotransferase, gamma,delta-dioxovalerate , aminotransferase , gamma,delta-dioxovaleric acid transaminase , 4,5-dioxovalerate aminotransferase , 4,5-dioxovaleric acid transaminase , 4,5-dioxovaleric transaminase , 5-aminolevulinic acid transaminase , alanine-gamma,delta-dioxovalerate aminotransferase , alanine-dioxovalerate aminotransferase , alanine:4,5-dioxovalerate aminotransferase , aminolevulinic acid transaminase , dioxovalerate transaminase , L-alanine-4,5-dioxovalerate aminotransferase , L-alanine:4,5-dioxovaleric acid transaminase , L-alanine:dioxovalerate transaminase , DOVA transaminase , and 4,5-dioxovaleric acid aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
