   Strongly positive bilinear form      Strongly positive bilinear form   A bilinear form , a (•,•) whose arguments are elements of normed vector space  V is a strongly positive bilinear form if and only if there exists a constant, c >0, such that       a   (  u  ,  u  )    ≥   c  ⋅    ∥  u  ∥   2          a   u  u     normal-⋅  c   superscript   norm  u   2      a(u,u)\geq c\cdot\|u\|^{2}     for all    u  ∈  V      u  V    u\in V   where    ∥  ⋅  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to    \|\cdot\|   is the norm on V .
