Intensity of counting processes

The intensity

 
  of a counting process is a measure of the rate of change of its predictable part. If a stochastic process

 
  is a counting process, then it is a submartingale, and in particular its  Doob-Meyer decomposition is



where 
 
 
 
  is a martingale and 
 
 
 
  is a predictable increasing process. 
 
 
 
  is called the cumulative intensity of 
 
 
 
  and it is related to 
 
 
 
  by


 
 .
Definition
Given probability space 
 
 
 
  and a counting process 
 
 
 
  which is adapted to the filtration 
 
 
 
 , the intensity of 
 
 
 
  is the process 
 
 
 
  defined by the following limit:


 
 .
The right-continuity property of counting processes allows us to take this limit from the right.1
Estimation
In statistical learning, the variation between 
 
 
 
  and its estimator

 
  can be bounded with the use of oracle inequalities.
If a counting process 
 
 
 
  is restricted to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 i.i.d. copies are observed on that interval, 
 
 
 
 , then the  least squares functional for the intensity is



which involves an Ito integral. If the assumption is made that 
 
 
 
  is piecewise constant on 
 
 
 
 , i.e. it depends on a vector of constants 
 
 
 
  and can be written


 
 ,
where the 
 
 
 
  have a factor of 
 
 
 
  so that they are orthonormal under the standard 
 
 
 
  norm, then by choosing appropriate data-driven weights 
 
 
 
  which depend on a parameter 
 
 
 
  and introducing the weighted norm


 
 ,
the estimator for 
 
 
 
  can be given:


 
 .
Then, the estimator 
 
 
 
  is just 
 
 
 
 . With these preliminaries, an oracle inequality bounding the 
 
 
 
  norm 
 
 
 
  is as follows: for appropriate choice of 
 
 
 
 ,



with probability greater than or equal to
