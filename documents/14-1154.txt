Wahba's problem

In applied mathematics, Wahba's problem, first posed by Grace Wahba in 1965, seeks to find a rotation matrix (special orthogonal matrix) between two coordinate systems from a set of (weighted) vector observations. Solutions to Wahba's problem are often used in satellite attitude determination utilising sensors such as magnetometers and multi-antenna GPS receivers. The cost function that Wahba's problem seeks to minimise is as follows:



where 
 
 
 
  is the k-th 3-vector measurement in the reference frame, 
 
 
 
  is the corresponding k-th 3-vector measurement in the body frame and 
 
 
 
  is a 3 by 3 rotation matrix between the coordinate frames. 
 
 
 
  is an optional set of weights for each observation.
A number of solutions to the problem have appeared in literature, notably Davenport's q-method, QUEST and singular value decomposition-based methods.
Solution by Singular Value Decomposition
One solution can be found using a singular value decomposition as reported by Markley
1. Obtain a matrix 
 
 
 
  as follows:



2. Find the singular value decomposition of 
 
 


3. The rotation matrix is simply:



where
