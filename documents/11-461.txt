Chondro-6-sulfatase




Chondro-6-sulfatase

In enzymology, a chondro-6-sulfatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 6-sulfate + H2O 
 
 
 
  4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine + sulfate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, 6-sulfate, and H2O, whereas its two products are 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine and sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on sulfuric ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-deoxy-beta-D-gluc-4-enuronosyl-(1,3)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine-6-su lfate 6-sulfohydrolase.
