   Characteristic subgroup      Characteristic subgroup   In mathematics , particularly in the area of abstract algebra known as group theory , a characteristic subgroup is a subgroup that is invariant under all automorphisms of the parent group . 1 2 Because conjugation is an automorphism, every characteristic subgroup is normal , though not every normal subgroup is characteristic. Examples of characteristic subgroups include the commutator subgroup and the center of a group .  Definitions  A characteristic subgroup of a group  G is a subgroup  H that is invariant under each automorphism of G . That is,       φ   (  H  )    =  H        φ  H   H    \varphi(H)=H   for every automorphism φ of G (where φ ( H ) denotes the image of H under φ ).  The statement “ H is a characteristic subgroup of G ” is written       H  char  G   .     char  H  G    H\mathrel{{}\operatorname{char}{}}G.     Characteristic vs. normal  If G is a group, and g is a fixed element of G , then the conjugation map      x  ↦   g  x   g   -  1        maps-to  x    g  x   superscript  g    1       x\mapsto gxg^{-1}   is an automorphism of G (known as an inner automorphism ). A subgroup of G that is invariant under all inner automorphisms is called normal . Since a characteristic subgroup is invariant under all automorphisms, every characteristic subgroup is normal.  Not every normal subgroup is characteristic. Here are several examples:   Let H be a nontrivial group, and let G be the direct product  H × H . Then the subgroups {1} × H and H × {1} are both normal, but neither is characteristic. In particular, neither of these subgroups is invariant under the automorphism ( x , y ) → ( y , x ) that switches the two factors.  For a concrete example of this, let V be the Klein four-group (which is isomorphic to the direct product Z 2 × Z 2 ). Since this group is abelian , every subgroup is normal; but every permutation of the three non-identity elements is an automorphism of V , so the three subgroups of order 2 are not characteristic.Here    V  =   {  e  ,  a  ,  b  ,   a  b   }       V   e  a  b    a  b      V=\left\{e,a,b,ab\right\}   Consider H={e,a} and consider the automorphism      T   (  e  )    =  e   ,     T   (  a  )    =  b   ,     T   (  b  )    =  a   ,    T   (   a  b   )    =   a  b         formulae-sequence      T  e   e    formulae-sequence      T  a   b    formulae-sequence      T  b   a       T    a  b      a  b        T(e)=e,T(a)=b,T(b)=a,T(ab)=ab   .Then T(H) is not contained in H .  In the quaternion group of order 8, each of the cyclic subgroups of order 4 is normal, but none of these are characteristic. However, the subgroup {1, −1} is characteristic, since it is the only subgroup of order 2.   Note: If H is the unique subgroup of a group G , then H is characteristic in G .   If n is even, the dihedral group of order 2 n has three subgroups of index two, all of which are normal. One of these is the cyclic subgroup, which is characteristic. The other two subgroups are dihedral; these are permuted by an outer automorphism of the parent group, and are therefore not characteristic.  "Normality" is not transitive, but Characteristic has a transitive property, namely if H Char K and K normal in G then H normal in G .   Comparison to other subgroup properties  Distinguished subgroups  A related concept is that of a distinguished subgroup (also called strictly characteristic subgroup ). In this case the subgroup H is invariant under the applications of surjective  endomorphisms . For a finite group this is the same, because surjectivity implies injectivity, but not for an infinite group: a surjective endomorphism is not necessarily an automorphism.  Fully invariant subgroups  For an even stronger constraint, a fully characteristic subgroup (also called a fully invariant subgroup ) H of a group G is a group remaining invariant under every endomorphism of G ; in other words, if f : G → G is any homomorphism , then f ( H ) is a subgroup of H .  Verbal subgroups  An even stronger constraint is verbal subgroup , which is the image of a fully invariant subgroup of a free group under a homomorphism.  Containments  Every subgroup that is fully characteristic is certainly distinguished and therefore characteristic; but a characteristic or even distinguished subgroup need not be fully characteristic.  The center of a group is always a distinguished subgroup, but it is not always fully characteristic. The finite group of order 12, Sym(3) × Z /2 Z has a homomorphism taking ( π , y ) to ( (1,2) y , 0 ) which takes the center 1 × Z /2 Z into a subgroup of Sym(3) × 1, which meets the center only in the identity.  The relationship amongst these subgroup properties can be expressed as:   subgroup ⇐ normal subgroup ⇐ characteristic subgroup ⇐ distinguished subgroup ⇐ fully characteristic subgroup ⇐ verbal subgroup    Examples  Finite example  Consider the group G = S 3 × Z 2 (the group of order 12 which is the direct product of the symmetric group of order 6 and a cyclic group of order 2). The center of G is its second factor Z 2 . Note that the first factor S 3 contains subgroups isomorphic to Z 2 , for instance {identity,(12)}; let f : Z 2 → S 3 be the morphism mapping Z 2 onto the indicated subgroup. Then the composition of the projection of G onto its second factor Z 2 , followed by f , followed by the inclusion of S 3 into G as its first factor, provides an endomorphism of G under which the image of the center Z 2 is not contained in the center, so here the center is not a fully characteristic subgroup of G .  Cyclic groups  Every subgroup of a cyclic group is characteristic.  Subgroup functors  The derived subgroup (or commutator subgroup) of a group is a verbal subgroup. The torsion subgroup of an abelian group is a fully invariant subgroup.  Topological groups  The identity component of a topological group is always a characteristic subgroup.  Transitivity  The property of being characteristic or fully characteristic is transitive ; if H is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of K , and K is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of G , then H is a (fully) characteristic subgroup of G .  Moreover, while it is not true that every normal subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal, it is true that every characteristic subgroup of a normal subgroup is normal. Similarly, while it is not true that every distinguished subgroup of a distinguished subgroup is distinguished, it is true that every fully characteristic subgroup of a distinguished subgroup is distinguished.  Map on Aut and End  If     H    char   G      H  char  G    H\,\mathrm{char}\,G   , then every automorphism of G induces an automorphism of the quotient group G/H , which yields a map      Aut   G   →     Aut   G   /  H      normal-→    Aut  G       Aut  G   H     \mbox{Aut}\,G\to\mbox{Aut}\,G/H   .  If H is fully characteristic in G , then analogously, every endomorphism of G induces an endomorphism of G/H , which yields a map      End   G   →     End   G   /  H      normal-→    End  G       End  G   H     \mbox{End}\,G\to\mbox{End}\,G/H   .
