Connes embedding problem

In von Neumann algebras, the Connes embedding problem or conjecture, due to Alain Connes, asks whether every type II1 factor on a separable Hilbert space can be embedded into the ultrapower of the hyperfinite type II1 factor by a free ultrafilter. The problem admits a number of equivalent formulations.1
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a free ultrafilter on the natural numbers and let R be the hyperfinite type II1 factor with trace 
 
 
 
 . One can construct the ultrapower 
 
 
 
  as follows: let 
 
 
 
 
  be the von Neumann algebra of norm-bounded sequences and let 
 
 
 
 . The quotient 
 
 
 
  turns out to be a II1 factor with trace 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is any representative sequence of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Connes' Embedding Conjecture asks whether every type II1 factor on a separable Hilbert space can be embedded into some 
 
 
 
 .
The isomorphism class of 
 
 
 
  is independent of the ultrafilter if and only if the continuum hypothesis is true (Ge-Hadwin and Farah-Hart-Sherman), but such an embedding property does not depend on the ultrafilter because von Neumann algebras acting on separable Hilbert spaces are, roughly speaking, very small.
