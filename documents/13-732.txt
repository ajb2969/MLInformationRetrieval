Polar hypersurface

In algebraic geometry, given a projective algebraic hypersurface C described by the homogeneous equation



and a point



its polar hypersurface Pa(C) is the hypersurface



where ƒi are the partial derivatives.
The intersection of C and Pa(C) is the set of points p such that the tangent at p to C meets a.
