Ramanujan's master theorem

In mathematics, Ramanujan's master theorem (named after mathematician Srinivasa Ramanujan1) is a technique that provides an analytic expression for the Mellin transform of a function. 
The result is stated as follows:
Assume function 
 
 
 
  has an expansion of the form



then Mellin transform of 
 
 
 
  is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is the Gamma function.
It was widely used by Ramanujan to calculate definite integrals and infinite series.
Multidimensional version of this theorem also appear in quantum physics (through Feynman diagrams).2
A similar result was also obtained by J. W. L. Glaisher.3
Alternative formalism
An alternative formulation of Ramanujan's master theorem is as follows:



which gets converted to original form after substituting 
 
 
 
  and using functional equation for Gamma function.
The integral above is convergent for 
 
 
 
 .
Proof
The proof of Ramanujan's Master Theorem provided by G. H. Hardy4 employs Cauchy's residue theorem as well as the well-known Mellin inversion theorem.
Application to Bernoulli polynomials
The generating function of the Bernoulli polynomials

 
 
  is given by:



These polynomials are given in terms of Hurwitz zeta function:



by 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . By means of Ramanujan master theorem and generating function of Bernoulli polynomials one will have following integral representation:5



valid for 
 
 
 
 .
Application to the Gamma function
Weierstrass's definition of the Gamma function



is equivalent to expression



where 
 
 
 
  is the Riemann zeta function.
Then applying Ramanujan master theorem we have:



valid for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are






Mathematica 7 is unable to compute these examples.6
Evaluation of quartic integral
It is well known for the evaluation of
$$F(a,m)=\int_0^\infty \frac{dx}{(x^4+2ax^2+1)^{m+1}}$$ which is a well known quartic integral.7
