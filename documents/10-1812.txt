Alkylmercury lyase




Alkylmercury lyase

In enzymology, an alkylmercury lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

an alkylmercury + H+

 
  an alkane + Hg2+
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alkylmercury and H+, whereas its two products are alkane and a mercury ion.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the "catch-all" class of lyases that do not fit into any other sub-class. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alkylmercury mercuric-lyase (alkane-forming). Other names in common use include organomercury lyase, organomercurial lyase, and alkylmercury mercuric-lyase.
The enzyme converts methyl mercury to the much less toxic elemental form of the metal.
