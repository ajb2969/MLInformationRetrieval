   Hadwiger's theorem      Hadwiger's theorem   In integral geometry (otherwise called geometric probability theory), Hadwiger's theorem characterises the valuations on convex bodies in R n . It was proved by Hugo Hadwiger .  Introduction  Valuations  Let K n be the collection of all compact convex sets in R n . A valuation is a function v : K n → R such that v (∅) = 0 and, for every S , T ∈ K n for which S ∪ T ∈ K n ,         v   (  S  )    +   v   (  T  )     =    v   (   S  ∩  T   )    +   v   (   S  ∪  T   )      .          v  S     v  T        v    S  T      v    S  T       v(S)+v(T)=v(S\cap T)+v(S\cup T)~{}.     A valuation is called continuous if it is continuous with respect to the Hausdorff metric . A valuation is called invariant under rigid motions if v ( φ ( S )) = v ( S ) whenever S ∈ K n and φ is either a translation or a rotation of R n .  Quermassintegrals  The quermassintegrals W j : K n → R are defined via Steiner's formula         Vol  n    (   K  +   t  B    )    =    ∑   j  =  0   n     (     n      j     )    W  j    (  K  )     t  j       ,         subscript  Vol  n     K    t  B       superscript   subscript     j  0    n      binomial  n  j    subscript  W  j   K   superscript  t  j       \mathrm{Vol}_{n}(K+tB)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}{\left({{n}\atop{j}}\right)}W_{j}(K)t^{j}%
 ~{},     where B is the Euclidean ball. For example, W 0 is the volume, W 1 is proportional to the surface measure , W n -1 is proportional to the mean width , and W n is the constant Vol n ( B ).  W j is a valuation which is homogeneous of degree n - j , that is,          W  j    (   t  K   )    =    t   n  -  j     W  j    (  K  )     ,   t  ≥   0     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  W  j     t  K       superscript  t    n  j     subscript  W  j   K      t  0     W_{j}(tK)=t^{n-j}W_{j}(K)~{},\quad t\geq 0~{}.     Statement  Any continuous valuation v on K n that is invariant under rigid motions can be represented as        v   (  S  )    =    ∑   j  =  0   n     c  j    W  j    (  S  )      .        v  S     superscript   subscript     j  0    n      subscript  c  j    subscript  W  j   S      v(S)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}c_{j}W_{j}(S)~{}.     Corollary  Any continuous valuation v on K n that is invariant under rigid motions and homogeneous of degree j is a multiple of W n - j .
