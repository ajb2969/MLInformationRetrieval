   Principle of distributivity      Principle of distributivity   The principle of distributivity states that the algebraic distributive law is valid for classical logic , where both logical conjunction and logical disjunction are distributive over each other so that for any propositions  A , B and C the equivalences       A  ∧   (   B  ∨  C   )    ⇔    (   A  ∧  B   )   ∨   (   A  ∧  C   )       iff    A    B  C        A  B     A  C      A\land(B\lor C)\iff(A\land B)\lor(A\land C)   and       A  ∨   (   B  ∧  C   )    ⇔    (   A  ∨  B   )   ∧   (   A  ∨  C   )       iff    A    B  C        A  B     A  C      A\lor(B\land C)\iff(A\lor B)\land(A\lor C)   hold.  The principle of distributivity is valid in classical logic , but invalid in quantum logic . The article Is logic empirical? discusses the case that quantum logic is the correct, empirical logic, on the grounds that the principle of distributivity is inconsistent with a reasonable interpretation of quantum phenomena .
