   Dipole field strength in free space      Dipole field strength in free space   Dipole field strength in free space , in telecommunications , is the electric field strength caused by a half wave dipole under ideal conditions. The actual field strength in terrestrial environments is calculated by empirical formulas based on this field strength.  Power density  Let N be the effective power radiated from an isotropic antenna and p be the power density at a distance d from this source 1      p  =   N   4  ⋅  π  ⋅   d  2         p    N   normal-⋅  4  π   superscript  d  2       \mbox{p}=\frac{N}{4\cdot\pi\cdot d^{2}}     Power density is also defined in terms of electrical field strength;  Let E be the electrical field and R be the impedance of the free space      p  =    E  2   R       p     superscript  E  2   R     \mbox{p}=\frac{E^{2}}{R}     The following relation is obtained by equating the two,       N   4  ⋅  π  ⋅   d  2     =    E  2   R         N   normal-⋅  4  π   superscript  d  2        superscript  E  2   R     \frac{N}{4\cdot\pi\cdot d^{2}}=\frac{E^{2}}{R}     or by rearranging the terms      E  =     N   ⋅   R     2  ⋅   π   ⋅  d        E     normal-⋅    N     R     normal-⋅  2    π   d      \mbox{E}=\frac{\sqrt{N}\cdot\sqrt{R}}{2\cdot\sqrt{\pi}\cdot d}     Numerical values  Impedance of free space is roughly    120  ⋅  π     normal-⋅  120  π    120\cdot\pi     Since a half wave dipole is used, its gain over an isotropic  antenna (    2.15 dBi  =  1.64      2.15 dBi  1.64    \mbox{2.15 dBi}=1.64   ) should also be taken into consideration,      E  =      1.64  ⋅  N    ⋅    120  ⋅  π      2  ⋅   π   ⋅  d    ≈   7  ⋅    N   d          E     normal-⋅     normal-⋅  1.64  N       normal-⋅  120  π      normal-⋅  2    π   d          normal-⋅  7      N   d       \mbox{E}=\frac{\sqrt{1.64\cdot N}\cdot\sqrt{120\cdot\pi}}{2\cdot\sqrt{\pi}%

 \approx 7\cdot\frac{\sqrt{N}}{d}     In this equation SI units are used.  Expressing the same equation in:   kW instead of W in power ,  km instead of m in distance and  mV/m instead of V/m in electric field    is equivalent to multiplying the expression on the right by    1000      1000    \sqrt{1000}   . 2 In this case,      E  ≈   222  ⋅    N   d        E   normal-⋅  222      N   d      \mbox{E}\approx 222\cdot\frac{\sqrt{N}}{d}         See also   Antennas  Effective radiated power  Electric field  Field strength meter   References and notes    "  Category:Telecommunication theory  Category:Antennas  Category:Broadcast engineering     Reference data for radio Engineers , Howard W.Sams co,Indianapolis, 1956, 27-7 ↩  K.H.Kaltbeitzer: Site selection , EBU Techhnical Monograph 3104,Bruxelles,1965, p 30 ↩
