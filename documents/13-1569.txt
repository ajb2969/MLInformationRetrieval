Dipole field strength in free space

Dipole field strength in free space, in telecommunications, is the electric field strength caused by a half wave dipole under ideal conditions. The actual field strength in terrestrial environments is calculated by empirical formulas based on this field strength.
Power density
Let N be the effective power radiated from an isotropic antenna and p be the power density at a distance d from this source1



Power density is also defined in terms of electrical field strength;
Let E be the electrical field and R be the impedance of the free space



The following relation is obtained by equating the two,



or by rearranging the terms



Numerical values
Impedance of free space is roughly 
 
 

Since a half wave dipole is used, its gain over an isotropic antenna (
 
 
 
  ) should also be taken into consideration,



In this equation SI units are used.
Expressing the same equation in:

kW instead of W in power,
 
km instead of m in distance and
 
mV/m instead of V/m in electric field


is equivalent to multiplying the expression on the right by 
 
 
 
 .2 In this case,
