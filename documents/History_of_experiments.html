<h1>History of experiments</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The history of <a href="Experiment" title="wikilink">experimental research</a> is long and varied. Indeed, the definition of an experiment itself has changed in responses to changing norms and practices within particular fields of study. This article documents the history and development of experimental research from its origins in <a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo's</a> study of gravity into the diversely applied method in use today.</p>

<p><a href="Galileo_Galilei" title="wikilink">Galileo Galilei</a> was a scientist who performed many quantitative experiments addressing many topics. Using several different methods, Galileo was able to accurately measure time. Previously, most scientists had used distance to describe falling bodies using <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>, which had been used and trusted since <a class="uri" href="Euclid" title="wikilink">Euclid</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Galileo himself used geometrical methods to express his results. Galileo's successes were aided by the development of a new mathematics as well as cleverly designed experiments and equipment. At that time, another kind of mathematics was being developed—<a class="uri" href="algebra" title="wikilink">algebra</a>. Algebra allowed arithmetical calculations to become as sophisticated as geometric ones. Algebra also allowed the discoveries of scientists such as Galileo—as well as later scientists like <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Newton</a>, <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">Maxwell</a> and <a class="uri" href="Einstein" title="wikilink">Einstein</a>—to be later summarized by mathematical <a class="uri" href="equations" title="wikilink">equations</a>. These equations described physical relationships in a precise, self-consistent manner.</p>

<p>One prominent example is the "ball and ramp experiment."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> In this experiment Galileo used an inclined plane and several steel balls of different weights. With this design, Galileo was able to slow down the falling motion and record, with reasonable accuracy, the times at which a steel ball passed certain markings on a beam.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Galileo disproved Aristotle's assertion that weight affects the speed of an object's fall. According to Aristotle's Theory of Falling Bodies, the heavier steel ball would reach the ground before the lighter steel ball. Galileo's hypothesis was that the two balls would reach the ground at the same time.</p>

<p>Other than Galileo, not many people of his day were able to accurately measure short time periods, such as the fall time of an object. Galileo accurately measured these short periods of time by creating a pulsilogon. This was a machine created to measure time using a <a class="uri" href="pendulum" title="wikilink">pendulum</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The pendulum was synchronized to the human <a class="uri" href="pulse" title="wikilink">pulse</a>. He used this to measure the time at which the weighted balls passed marks that he had made on the inclined plane. He measured to find that balls of different weights reached the bottom of the <a href="inclined_plane" title="wikilink">inclined plane</a> at the same time and that the distance traveled was proportional to the square of the elapsed time.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> Later scientists summarized Galileo's results as <a href="Equations_for_a_falling_body" title="wikilink">The Equation of Falling Bodies</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>These results supported Galileo's hypothesis that objects of different weights, when measured at the same point in their fall, are falling at the same speed because they experience the same gravitational acceleration.</p>
<h2 id="antoine-lavoisier">Antoine Lavoisier</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>

<p><a href="Antoine_Lavoisier" title="wikilink">Antoine Lavoisier</a> (1743–1794) was a French chemist regarded as the founder of modern chemistry. Lavoisier's experiments were among the first truly quantitative chemical experiments. He showed that, although matter changes its state in a <a href="chemical_reaction" title="wikilink">chemical reaction</a>, the quantity of <a class="uri" href="matter" title="wikilink">matter</a> is the same at the end as at the beginning of every chemical reaction. In one experiment, he burned phosphorus and sulfur in air to see whether the results further supported his previous conclusion (<a href="Law_of_Conservation_of_Mass" title="wikilink">Law of Conservation of Mass</a>). In this experiment, however, he determined that the products weighed more than the original phosphorus and sulfur. He decided to do the experiment again. This time he measured the mass of the air surrounding the experiment as well. He discovered that the mass gained in the product was lost from the air. These experiments provided further support for his <a href="Law_of_Conservation_of_Mass" title="wikilink">Law of Conservation of Mass</a>.</p>

<p>One of Lavoisier's experiments connected the worlds of <a href="Respiration_(physiology)" title="wikilink">respiration</a> and <a class="uri" href="combustion" title="wikilink">combustion</a>. Lavoisier's hypothesis was that combustion and respiration were one and the same, and combustion occurs with every instance of respiration. Lavoisier, working with <a href="Pierre-Simon_Laplace" title="wikilink">Pierre-Simon Laplace</a>, designed an ice <a class="uri" href="calorimeter" title="wikilink">calorimeter</a> apparatus for measuring the amount of heat given off during combustion or respiration. This machine consisted of three concentric compartments. The center compartment held the source of heat, in this case, the <a href="guinea_pig" title="wikilink">guinea pig</a> or piece of burning <a class="uri" href="charcoal" title="wikilink">charcoal</a>. The middle compartment held a specific amount of ice for the heat source to melt. The outside compartment contained packed snow for insulation. Lavoisier then measured the quantity of carbon dioxide and the quantity of heat produced by confining a live guinea pig in this apparatus. Lavoisier also measured the heat and carbon dioxide produced when burning a piece of charcoal in the calorimeter. Using this data, he concluded that respiration was in fact a slow combustion process. He also discovered through precise measurements that these processes produced carbon dioxide and heat with the same constant of proportionality. He found that for 224 grains of "fixed air" (CO<sub>2</sub>) produced, . of ice was melted in the calorimeter. Converting grains to grams and using the energy required to melt . of ice, one can compute that for each gram of CO<sub>2</sub> produced, about 2.02 kcal of energy was produced by the combustion of carbon or by respiration in Lavoisier's calorimeter experiments. This compares well with the modern published <a href="heat_of_combustion" title="wikilink">heat of combustion</a> for carbon of 2.13 kcal/g.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> This continuous slow combustion, which Lavoisier and Laplace supposed took place in the <a class="uri" href="lungs" title="wikilink">lungs</a>, enabled the living animal to maintain its body temperature above that of its surroundings, thus accounting for the puzzling phenomenon of animal heat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> Lavoisier concluded, "Lla respiration est donc une combustion," That is, respiratory gas exchange is combustion, like that of burning a candle.</p>

<p>Lavoisier was the first to conclude by experiment that the <a href="Law_of_Conservation_of_Mass" title="wikilink">Law of Conservation of Mass</a> applied to chemical change.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> His hypothesis was that the mass of the reactants would be the same as the mass of the products in a <a href="chemical_reaction" title="wikilink">chemical reaction</a>. He experimented on vinous <a href="fermentation_(wine)" title="wikilink">fermentation</a>. He determined the amounts of <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>, <a class="uri" href="oxygen" title="wikilink">oxygen</a>, and <a class="uri" href="carbon" title="wikilink">carbon</a> in <a class="uri" href="sugar" title="wikilink">sugar</a>. He weighed a quantity of sugar, added <a class="uri" href="yeast" title="wikilink">yeast</a> and <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a> in measured amounts, and allowed the mixture to ferment. Lavoisier measured the mass of the carbonic acid gas and water that were given off during fermentation and weighed the residual liquor, the components of which were then separated and analyzed to determine their elementary composition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> In this way he controlled a couple of potential confounding factors. He was able to capture the carbonic acid gas and water vapor that were given off during fermentation so that his final measurements would be as accurate as possible. Lavoisier then concluded that the total mass of the reactants was equal to the mass of the final product and residue.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> Moreover, he showed that the total mass of each constituent element before and after the chemical change remained the same. Similarly, he demonstrated via experimentation that the mass of products of combustion is equal to the mass of the reacting ingredients.</p>

<p>The French <a class="uri" href="biologist" title="wikilink">biologist</a> <a href="Louis_Pasteur" title="wikilink">Louis Pasteur</a> (1822-1895), regarded as the "Father of microbiological sciences and immunology", worked during the 19th century.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> He postulated - and supported with experimental results - the idea that disease-causing agents do not spontaneously appear but are alive and need the right environment to prosper and multiply. Stemming from this discovery, he used experimentation to develop vaccines for <a href="chicken_cholera" title="wikilink">chicken cholera</a>, <a class="uri" href="anthrax" title="wikilink">anthrax</a> and <a class="uri" href="rabies" title="wikilink">rabies</a>, and to develop methods for reducing <a class="uri" href="bacteria" title="wikilink">bacteria</a> in some food products by heating them (<a class="uri" href="pasteurization" title="wikilink">pasteurization</a>). His work also led him to advocate (along with the English physician Dr. <a href="Joseph_Lister,_1st_Baron_Lister" title="wikilink">Joseph Lister</a>) for antiseptic surgical techniques. Most scientists of that day believed that microscopic life sprang into existence from nonliving matter. This idea was called <a href="spontaneous_generation" title="wikilink">spontaneous generation</a>.</p>

<p>Pasteur's observations of tiny <a class="uri" href="organisms" title="wikilink">organisms</a> under the <a class="uri" href="microscope" title="wikilink">microscope</a> caused him to doubt spontaneous generation. He designed an experiment to test it. His <a class="uri" href="hypothesis" title="wikilink">hypothesis</a> was that life could not arise from where there is no life. He took care to control possible confounding factors. For example, he needed to make sure there was no life, even microscopic, in the flasks of broth he used as a test medium. He decided to kill any microscopic organisms already present by boiling the broth until he was confident that any microorganisms present were killed. Pasteur also needed to make sure that no microscopic organisms entered the broth after boiling, yet the broth needed exposure to air to properly test the theory. A colleague suggested a flask with a neck the shape of an "S" turned sideways. Dust (which Pasteur thought contained microorganisms) would be trapped at the bottom of the first curve, but the air would flow freely through.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>

<p>Thus, if bacteria should really be spontaneously generated, then they should be growing in the flask after a few days. If spontaneous generation did not occur, then the contents of the flasks would remain lifeless. The experiment appeared conclusive: not a single microorganism appeared in the broth. Then Pasteur allowed the dust containing the microorganisms to mix with the broth. In just a few days the broth became cloudy from millions of organisms growing in it. For two more years, he repeated the experiment in various conditions and locales to assure himself that the results were correct. In this way Pasteur supported his hypothesis that spontaneous generation does not occur.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Despite the experimental results supporting his hypotheses and his success curing or preventing various diseases, correcting the public misconception of spontaneous generation proved a slow, difficult process.</p>

<p>As he worked to solve specific problems, Pasteur sometimes revised his ideas in the light of the results of his experiments, as when faced with the task of finding the cause of disease devastating the French <a href="sericulture" title="wikilink"> silkworm industry</a> in 1865. After a year of diligent work he correctly identified a culprit organism and gave practical advice for developing a healthy population of moths. However, when he tested his own advice, he found disease still present. It turned out he had been correct but incomplete – there were two organisms at work. It took two more years of experimenting to find the complete solution.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
