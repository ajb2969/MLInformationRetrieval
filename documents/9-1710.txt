   Tonelli's theorem (functional analysis)      Tonelli's theorem (functional analysis)   In mathematics , Tonelli's theorem in functional analysis is a fundamental result on the weak  lower semicontinuity of nonlinear  functionals on L p spaces . As such, it has major implications for functional analysis and the calculus of variations . Roughly, it shows that weak lower semicontinuity for integral functionals is equivalent to convexity of the integral kernel. The result is attributed to the Italian  mathematician  Leonida Tonelli .  Statement of the theorem  Let Ω be a bounded domain in n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n and let f : R m → R ∪ {±∞} be a continuous  extended real-valued function. Define a nonlinear functional F on functions u : Ω → R m by        F   [  u  ]    =    ∫  Ω    f   (   u   (  x  )    )   d  x     .        F   delimited-[]  u      subscript   normal-Ω     f    u  x   normal-d  x      F[u]=\int_{\Omega}f(u(x))\,\mathrm{d}x.     Then F is sequentially weakly lower semicontinuous on the L p space L p (Ω; R m ) for 1 ∞(Ω; R m ) if and only if the function f       ℝ  m   ∋  u  ↦   f   (  u  )    ∈   ℝ  ∪   {   ±  ∞   }         contains   superscript  ℝ  m   u    maps-to      f  u          ℝ    plus-or-minus         \mathbb{R}^{m}\ni u\mapsto f(u)\in\mathbb{R}\cup\{\pm\infty\}     is convex.
