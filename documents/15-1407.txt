Octanoyl-(GcvH):protein N-octanoyltransferase

Octanoyl-(GcvH):protein N-octanoyltransferase (, LIPL, octanoyl-[GcvH]:E2 amidotransferase, YWFL (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (glycine cleavage system H)-N6-octanoyl-L-lysine:(lipoyl-carrier protein)-N6-L-lysine octanoyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

[glycine cleavage system H]-N6-octanoyl-L-lysine + [lipoyl-carrier protein] 
 
 
 
  glycine cleavage system H + [lipoyl-carrier protein]-N6-octanoyl-L-lysine
 

This enzyme is purified form the bacterium Bacillus subtilis.
