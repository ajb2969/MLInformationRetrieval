   Octanoyl-(GcvH):protein N-octanoyltransferase      Octanoyl-(GcvH):protein N-octanoyltransferase   Octanoyl-(GcvH):protein N-octanoyltransferase (, LIPL , octanoyl-[GcvH]:E2 amidotransferase , YWFL (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name (glycine cleavage system H)-N 6 -octanoyl-L-lysine:(lipoyl-carrier protein)-N 6 -L-lysine octanoyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   [glycine cleavage system H]-N 6 -octanoyl-L-lysine + [lipoyl-carrier protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycine cleavage system H + [lipoyl-carrier protein]-N 6 -octanoyl-L-lysine   This enzyme is purified form the bacterium Bacillus subtilis .
