Phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase




Phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a phosphoethanolamine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + ethanolamine phosphate 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methylethanolamine phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and ethanolamine phosphate, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and N-methylethanolamine phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:ethanolamine-phosphate N-methyltransferase. This enzyme is also called phosphoethanolamine methyltransferase. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
