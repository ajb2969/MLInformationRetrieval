   Quincunx matrix      Quincunx matrix   In mathematics , the matrix      (     1     -  1       1    1     )      1    1     1  1     \begin{pmatrix}1&-1\\
 1&1\end{pmatrix}     is sometimes called the quincunx matrix . It is a 2×2 Hadamard matrix , and its rows form the basis of a diagonal square lattice consisting of the integer points whose coordinates both have the same parity ; this lattice is a two-dimensional analogue of the three-dimensional body-centered cubic lattice . 1  See also   Quincunx   Notes  "  Category:Matrices     . ↩
