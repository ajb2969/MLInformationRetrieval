   Mitchell's embedding theorem      Mitchell's embedding theorem   Mitchell's embedding theorem , also known as the Freyd–Mitchell theorem or the full embedding theorem , is a result about abelian categories ; it essentially states that these categories, while rather abstractly defined, are in fact concrete categories of modules . This allows one to use element-wise diagram chasing proofs in these categories.  The precise statement is as follows: if A is a small abelian category, then there exists a ring  R (with 1, not necessarily commutative) and a full , faithful and exact  functor  F : A → R -Mod (where the latter denotes the category of all left R -modules ).  The functor F yields an equivalence between A and a full subcategory of R -Mod in such a way that kernels and cokernels computed in A correspond to the ordinary kernels and cokernels computed in R -Mod. Such an equivalence is necessarily additive . The theorem thus essentially says that the objects of A can be thought of as R -modules, and the morphisms as R -linear maps, with kernels, cokernels, exact sequences and sums of morphisms being determined as in the case of modules. However, projective and injective objects in A do not necessarily correspond to projective and injective R -modules.  Sketch of the proof  Let    ℒ  ⊂   Fun   (  𝒜  ,   A  b   )        ℒ   Fun  𝒜    A  b      \mathcal{L}\subset\operatorname{Fun}(\mathcal{A},Ab)   be the category of left exact functors from the abelian category   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   to the category of abelian groups     A  b      A  b    Ab   . First we construct a contravariant embedding    H  :   𝒜  →  ℒ      normal-:  H   normal-→  𝒜  ℒ     H:\mathcal{A}\to\mathcal{L}   by     H   (  A  )    =   h  A         H  A    subscript  h  A     H(A)=h_{A}   for all    A  ∈  𝒜      A  𝒜    A\in\mathcal{A}   , where    h  A     subscript  h  A    h_{A}   is the covariant hom-functor,      h  A    (  X  )    =    Hom  𝒜    (  A  ,  X  )           subscript  h  A   X     subscript  Hom  𝒜   A  X     h_{A}(X)=\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(A,X)   . The Yoneda Lemma states that   H   H   H   is fully faithful and we also get the left exactness of   H   H   H   very easily because    h  A     subscript  h  A    h_{A}   is already left exact. The proof of the right exactness of   H   H   H   is harder and can be read in Swan, Lecture Notes in Mathematics 76 .  After that we prove that   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   is an abelian category by using localization theory (also Swan). This is the hard part of the proof.  It is easy to check that   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   has an injective cogenerator       I  =    ∏   A  ∈  𝒜     h  A     .      I    subscript  product    A  𝒜     subscript  h  A      I=\prod_{A\in\mathcal{A}}h_{A}.   The endomorphism ring     R  :=    Hom  ℒ    (  I  ,  I  )       assign  R    subscript  Hom  ℒ   I  I     R:=\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{L}}(I,I)   is the ring we need for the category of R -modules.  By     G   (  B  )    =    Hom  ℒ    (  B  ,  I  )          G  B     subscript  Hom  ℒ   B  I     G(B)=\operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{L}}(B,I)   we get another contravariant, exact and fully faithful embedding     G  :   ℒ  →   R   -  Mod      .     normal-:  G   normal-→  ℒ    R    Mod       G:\mathcal{L}\to R\operatorname{-Mod}.   The composition     G  H   :   𝒜  →   R   -  Mod        normal-:    G  H    normal-→  𝒜    R    Mod       GH:\mathcal{A}\to R\operatorname{-Mod}   is the desired covariant exact and fully faithful embedding.  Note that the proof of the Gabriel-Quillen embedding theorem for exact categories is almost identical.
