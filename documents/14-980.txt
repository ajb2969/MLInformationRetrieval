   Relative scalar      Relative scalar   In mathematics, a relative scalar (of weight w ) is a scalar-valued function whose transform under a coordinate transform,        x  ¯   j   =     x  ¯   j    (   x  i   )         superscript   normal-¯  x   j      superscript   normal-¯  x   j    superscript  x  i      \bar{x}^{j}=\bar{x}^{j}(x^{i})     on an n -dimensional manifold obeys the following equation        f  ¯    (    x  ¯   j   )    =    J  w   f   (   x  i   )           normal-¯  f    superscript   normal-¯  x   j       superscript  J  w   f   superscript  x  i      \bar{f}(\bar{x}^{j})=J^{w}f(x^{i})     where       J  =   |       ∂   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )     ∂   (    x  ¯   1   ,  …  ,    x  ¯   n   )        |    ,      J           subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       superscript   normal-¯  x   1   normal-…   superscript   normal-¯  x   n          J=\begin{vmatrix}\displaystyle\frac{\partial(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})}{\partial(%
 \bar{x}^{1},\ldots,\bar{x}^{n})}\end{vmatrix},     that is, the determinant of the Jacobian of the transformation. 1 A scalar density refers to the    w  =  1      w  1    w=1   case.  Relative scalars are an important special case of the more general concept of a relative tensor .  Ordinary scalar  An ordinary scalar or absolute scalar 2 refers to the    w  =  0      w  0    w=0   case.  If    x  i     superscript  x  i    x^{i}   and     x  ¯   j     superscript   normal-¯  x   j    \bar{x}^{j}   refer to the same point   P   P   P   on the manifold, then we desire      f  ¯    (    x  ¯   j   )    =   f   (   x  i   )           normal-¯  f    superscript   normal-¯  x   j      f   superscript  x  i      \bar{f}(\bar{x}^{j})=f(x^{i})   . This equation can be interpreted two ways when     x  ¯   j     superscript   normal-¯  x   j    \bar{x}^{j}   are viewed as the "new coordinates" and    x  i     superscript  x  i    x^{i}   are viewed as the "original coordinates". The first is as      f  ¯    (    x  ¯   j   )    =   f   (    x  i    (    x  ¯   j   )    )           normal-¯  f    superscript   normal-¯  x   j      f     superscript  x  i    superscript   normal-¯  x   j       \bar{f}(\bar{x}^{j})=f(x^{i}(\bar{x}^{j}))   , which "converts the function to the new coordinates". The second is as     f   (   x  i   )    =    f  ¯    (     x  ¯   j    (   x  i   )    )          f   superscript  x  i       normal-¯  f      superscript   normal-¯  x   j    superscript  x  i       f(x^{i})=\bar{f}(\bar{x}^{j}(x^{i}))   , which "converts back to the original coordinates. Of course, "new" or "original" is a relative concept.  There are many physical quantities that are represented by ordinary scalars, such as temperature and pressure.  Weight 0 example  Suppose the temperature in a room is given in terms of the function     f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =    2  x   +  y  +  5         f   x  y  z        2  x   y  5     f(x,y,z)=2x+y+5   in Cartesian coordinates    (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )     x  y  z    (x,y,z)   and the function in cylindrical coordinates    (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )     r  t  h    (r,t,h)   is desired. The two coordinate systems are related by the following sets of equations:      r  =      x  2   +   y  2          r       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\,         t  =   arctan   (   y  /  x   )        t      y  x      t=\arctan(y/x)\,         h  =   z       h  z    h=z\,   and      x  =   r   cos   (  t  )         x    r    t      x=r\cos(t)\,         y  =   r   sin   (  t  )         y    r    t      y=r\sin(t)\,          z  =  h   .      z  h    z=h.\,     Using      f  ¯    (    x  ¯   j   )    =   f   (    x  i    (    x  ¯   j   )    )           normal-¯  f    superscript   normal-¯  x   j      f     superscript  x  i    superscript   normal-¯  x   j       \bar{f}(\bar{x}^{j})=f(x^{i}(\bar{x}^{j}))   allows one to derive      f  ¯    (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )    =    2  r   cos   (  t  )     +   r   sin   (  t  )     +  5          normal-¯  f    r  t  h        2  r    t      r    t    5     \bar{f}(r,t,h)=2r\cos(t)+r\sin(t)+5   as the transformed function.  Consider the point   P   P   P   whose Cartesian coordinates are     (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   =   (  2  ,  3  ,  4  )        x  y  z    2  3  4     (x,y,z)=(2,3,4)   and whose corresponding value in the cylindrical system is     (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )   =   (   13   ,   arctan   (   3  /  2   )    ,  4  )        r  t  h      13       3  2    4     (r,t,h)=(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)   . A quick calculation shows that     f   (  2  ,  3  ,  4  )    =  12        f   2  3  4    12    f(2,3,4)=12   and      f  ¯    (   13   ,   arctan   (   3  /  2   )    ,  4  )    =  12         normal-¯  f      13       3  2    4    12    \bar{f}(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)=12   also. This equality would have held for any chosen point   P   P   P   . Thus,    f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )       f   x  y  z     f(x,y,z)   is the "temperature function in the Cartesian coordinate system" and     f  ¯    (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )        normal-¯  f    r  t  h     \bar{f}(r,t,h)   is the "temperature function in the cylindrical coordinate system".  One way to view these functions is as representations of the "parent" function that takes a point of the manifold as an argument and gives the temperature.  The problem could have been reversed. One could have been given    f  ¯     normal-¯  f    \bar{f}   and wished to have derived the Cartesian temperature function   f   f   f   . This just flips the notion of "new" vs the "original" coordinate system.  Suppose that one wishes to integrate these functions over "the room", which will be denoted by   D   D   D   . (Yes, integrating temperature is strange but that's partly what's to be shown.) Suppose the region   D   D   D   is given in cylindrical coordinates as   r   r   r   from    [  0  ,  2  ]     0  2    [0,2]   ,   t   t   t   from    [  0  ,   π  /  2   ]     0    π  2     [0,\pi/2]   and   h   h   h   from    [  0  ,  2  ]     0  2    [0,2]   (that is, the "room" is a quarter slice of a cylinder of radius and height 2). The integral of   f   f   f   over the region   D   D   D   is         ∫  0  2       ∫  0     2  2   -   x  2          ∫  0  2     f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   d   z   d   y   d  x      =   16  +   10  π          superscript   subscript   0   2     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  2  2    superscript  x  2        superscript   subscript   0   2     f   x  y  z   d  z  d  y  d  x        16    10  π      \int_{0}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\sqrt{2^{2}-x^{2}}}\!\int_{0}^{2}\!f(x,y,z)\,dz\,dy\,%
 dx=16+10\pi   . 3 The value of the integral of    f  ¯     normal-¯  f    \bar{f}   over the same region is         ∫  0  2       ∫  0   π  /  2        ∫  0  2      f  ¯    (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )   d   h   d   t   d  r      =   12  +   10  π          superscript   subscript   0   2     superscript   subscript   0     π  2      superscript   subscript   0   2      normal-¯  f    r  t  h   d  h  d  t  d  r        12    10  π      \int_{0}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\!\int_{0}^{2}\!\bar{f}(r,t,h)\,dh\,dt\,dr=12+10\pi   . 4 They are not equal. The integral of temperature is not independent of the coordinate system used. It is non-physical in that sense, hence "strange". Note that if the integral of    f  ¯     normal-¯  f    \bar{f}   included a factor of the Jacobian (which is just   r   r   r   ), we get         ∫  0  2       ∫  0   π  /  2        ∫  0  2      f  ¯    (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )    r   d   h   d   t   d  r      =   16  +   10  π          superscript   subscript   0   2     superscript   subscript   0     π  2      superscript   subscript   0   2      normal-¯  f    r  t  h   r  d  h  d  t  d  r        16    10  π      \int_{0}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\!\int_{0}^{2}\!\bar{f}(r,t,h)r\,dh\,dt\,dr=16+10\pi   , 5 which is equal to the original integral but it is not however the integral of temperature because temperature is a relative scalar of weight 0, not a relative scalar of weight 1.  Weight 1 example  If we had said     f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =    2  x   +  y  +  5         f   x  y  z        2  x   y  5     f(x,y,z)=2x+y+5   was representing mass density, however, then its transformed value should include the Jacobian factor that takes into account the geometric distortion of the coordinate system. The transformed function is now      f  ¯    (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )    =    (    2  r   cos   (  t  )     +   r   sin   (  t  )     +  5   )   r          normal-¯  f    r  t  h          2  r    t      r    t    5   r     \bar{f}(r,t,h)=(2r\cos(t)+r\sin(t)+5)r   . This time     f   (  2  ,  3  ,  4  )    =  12        f   2  3  4    12    f(2,3,4)=12   but      f  ¯    (   13   ,   arctan   (   3  /  2   )    ,  4  )    =   12   29           normal-¯  f      13       3  2    4      12    29      \bar{f}(\sqrt{13},\arctan{(3/2)},4)=12\sqrt{29}   . As before is integral (the total mass) in Cartesian coordinates is         ∫  0  2       ∫  0     2  2   -   x  2          ∫  0  2     f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   d   z   d   y   d  x      =   16  +   10  π          superscript   subscript   0   2     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  2  2    superscript  x  2        superscript   subscript   0   2     f   x  y  z   d  z  d  y  d  x        16    10  π      \int_{0}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\sqrt{2^{2}-x^{2}}}\!\int_{0}^{2}\!f(x,y,z)\,dz\,dy\,%
 dx=16+10\pi   . The value of the integral of    f  ¯     normal-¯  f    \bar{f}   over the same region is         ∫  0  2       ∫  0   π  /  2        ∫  0  2      f  ¯    (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )   d   h   d   t   d  r      =   16  +   10  π          superscript   subscript   0   2     superscript   subscript   0     π  2      superscript   subscript   0   2      normal-¯  f    r  t  h   d  h  d  t  d  r        16    10  π      \int_{0}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\!\int_{0}^{2}\!\bar{f}(r,t,h)\,dh\,dt\,dr=16+10\pi   . They are equal. The integral of mass density gives total mass which is a coordinate-independent concept. Note that if the integral of    f  ¯     normal-¯  f    \bar{f}   also included a factor of the Jacobian like before, we get         ∫  0  2       ∫  0   π  /  2        ∫  0  2      f  ¯    (  r  ,  t  ,  h  )    r   d   h   d   t   d  r      =   24  +    40  π   /  3          superscript   subscript   0   2     superscript   subscript   0     π  2      superscript   subscript   0   2      normal-¯  f    r  t  h   r  d  h  d  t  d  r        24      40  π   3      \int_{0}^{2}\!\int_{0}^{\pi/2}\!\int_{0}^{2}\!\bar{f}(r,t,h)r\,dh\,dt\,dr=24+4%
 0\pi/3   , 6 which is not equal to the previous case.  Other cases  Weights other than 0 and 1 do not arise as often. It can be shown the determinant of a type (0,2) tensor is a relative scalar of weight 2.
