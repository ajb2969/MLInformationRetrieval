Indian and ISO standards for dimensioning

Machine parts are manufactured in India according to design given by Indian manufacturers. These parts are made with dimensions or design in accordance with the Indian Standards, while the machine components manufactured in rest of the world are manufactured according to their own standards and/or international standards. For large machining, Indians import small machine parts. As these parts are manufactured in other countries, they are not manufactured as per the Indian standards. ISO standards were set up with the use of all countries' standard designation. According to the manufacturing requirement, usually these two standards, viz., Indian and ISO standards, are used. There is nothing like that the standards out of these are wrong.
Differences in the two systems
1. Indian standards give the standard principles in a generalized form, i.e., it gives principles for dimensioning any drawing, whether it is a machine-part or assembly of parts. Whereas, the ISO Standards give a perfect set of standard codes to be followed while dimensioning the drawing (separate rules for part drawing and assembled drawing).
 2. Indian standards are broader in concept, i.e., they give the common standards for designing as well as the manufacturing of the machine component. On the other hand, in ISO standards there are individual different rules for the designing purpose and for the manufacturing purpose.
 3. Indian standards are used only in India, while ISO standards are internationally accepted.
 4. Manufacturers in India manufacture the machine components as per the Indian standards only. But this creates a problem in export and of components as the components manufactured in other countries are as per either the standards of their own country or ISO standards. Hence, we conclude that there are some differences in Indian and ISO standards.
 5. Components manufactured in accordance with the Indian standards are very less viable to meet with imported components; the components of ISO type are very much likely to be met with any component, manufactured anywhere in the world. This is because ISO standards are established by taking into consideration the standards of all the countries in the world.

The symmetry symbol's characteristics were not included in the version of the chart that this chart is derived from. The symmetry symbol was dropped from the Y14.5M standard around 1988 and re-added around 1994. (It's been speculated that it will be re-dropped the next time the standard is revised.)

Notes:

The  symbol is not part of the 1994 version. See para. A5, bullet 3. Also para. D3. Also, Figure 3-8.
The  symbol appears in the 2009 version of the standard, and refers to unequal profile distribution.
All the symbols above are used in a feature control frame to specify a feature's description, tolerance, modifier and datum references.

Datums and datum references
A datum is a theoretical ideal plane, line, point, or cylinder. A datum feature is a physical feature of the part identified by a datum feature symbol and corresponding datum feature triangle, e.g.,


 
  These are then referred to by one or more datum feature reference which indicate measurements should be made with respect to the corresponding datum feature and may be found in a datum reference frame.
