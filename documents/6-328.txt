   Selberg class      Selberg class   In mathematics , the Selberg class is an axiomatic definition of a class of L -functions . The members of the class are Dirichlet series which obey four axioms that seem to capture the essential properties satisfied by most functions that are commonly called L -functions or zeta functions . Although the exact nature of the class is conjectural, the hope is that the definition of the class will lead to a classification of its contents and an elucidation of its properties, including insight into their relationship to automorphic forms and the Riemann hypothesis . The class was defined by Atle Selberg in .  Definition  The formal definition of the class S is the set of all Dirichlet series       F   (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     a  n    n  s           F  s     superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n    superscript  n  s       F(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{n^{s}}     absolutely convergent for Re( s ) > 1 that satisfy four axioms:  {p^{ns}}\Big)  and, for some θ b_{p^n}=O(p^{n\theta}).\, }}  Comments on definition  The condition that the real part of μ i be non-negative is because there are known L -functions that do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis when μ i is negative. Specifically, there are Maass forms associated with exceptional eigenvalues, for which the Ramanujan–Peterssen conjecture holds, and have a functional equation, but do not satisfy the Riemann hypothesis.  The condition that θ  It is a consequence of 4. that the a n are multiplicative and that        F  p    (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞      a   p  n     p   n  s     for Re   (  s  )     >  0.           subscript  F  p   s     superscript   subscript     n  0           subscript  a   superscript  p  n     superscript  p    n  s     for Re  s         0.     F_{p}(s)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{p^{n}}}{p^{ns}}\text{ for Re}(s)>0.     Examples  The prototypical example of an element in S is the Riemann zeta function . 1 Another example, is the L -function of the modular discriminant Δ       L   (  s  ,  Δ  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     a  n    n  s           L   s  normal-Δ      superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n    superscript  n  s       L(s,\Delta)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{n^{s}}   where     a  n   =    τ   (  n  )    /   n   11  /  2          subscript  a  n       τ  n    superscript  n    11  2       a_{n}=\tau(n)/n^{11/2}   and τ( n ) is the Ramanujan tau function . 2  All known examples are automorphic L -functions , and the reciprocals of F p ( s ) are polynomials in p − s of bounded degree. 3  Basic properties  As with the Riemann zeta function, an element F of S has trivial zeroes that arise from the poles of the gamma factor γ( s ). The other zeroes are referred to as the non-trivial zeroes of F . These will all be located in some strip . Denoting the number of non-trivial zeroes of F with  by N F ( T ), 4 Selberg showed that         N  F    (  T  )    =     d  F     T   log   (   T  +  C   )      2  π     +   O   (   log  T   )      .         subscript  N  F   T        subscript  d  F       T      T  C       2  π       O    T       N_{F}(T)=d_{F}\frac{T\log(T+C)}{2\pi}+O(\log T).   Here, d F is called the degree (or dimension ) of F . It is given by 5        d  F   =   2    ∑   i  =  1   k    ω  i      .       subscript  d  F     2    superscript   subscript     i  1    k    subscript  ω  i       d_{F}=2\sum_{i=1}^{k}\omega_{i}.   It can be shown that F = 1 is the only function in S whose degree is less than 1.  If F and G are in the Selberg class, then so is their product and        d   F  G    =    d  F   +   d  G     .       subscript  d    F  G       subscript  d  F    subscript  d  G      d_{FG}=d_{F}+d_{G}.   A function  in S is called primitive if whenever it is written as F = F 1 F 2 , with F i in S , then F = F 1 or F = F 2 . If d F = 1, then F is primitive. Every function  of S can be written as a product of primitive functions. Selberg's conjectures, described below, imply that the factorization into primitive functions is unique.  Examples of primitive functions include the Riemann zeta function and Dirichlet L -functions of primitive Dirichlet characters. Assuming conjectures 1 and 2 below, L -functions of irreducible  cuspidal  automorphic representations that satisfy the Ramanujan conjecture are primitive. 6  Selberg's conjectures  In , Selberg made conjectures concerning the functions in S :   Conjecture 1: For all F in S , there is an integer n F such that           ∑   p  ≤  x       |   a  p   |   2   p    =     n  F    log   log  x     +   O   (  1  )           subscript     p  x       superscript     subscript  a  p    2   p         subscript  n  F       x       O  1      \sum_{p\leq x}\frac{|a_{p}|^{2}}{p}=n_{F}\log\log x+O(1)       and n F = 1 whenever F is primitive.    Conjecture 2: For distinct primitive F , F ′ ∈ S ,            ∑   p  ≤  x       a  p    a  p  ′    p    =   O   (  1  )     .        subscript     p  x         subscript  a  p    superscript   subscript  a  p   normal-′    p      O  1     \sum_{p\leq x}\frac{a_{p}a_{p}^{\prime}}{p}=O(1).         Conjecture 3: If F is in S with primitive factorization          F  =    ∏   i  =  1   m    F  i     ,      F    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    m    subscript  F  i      F=\prod_{i=1}^{m}F_{i},       χ is a primitive Dirichlet character, and the function       F  χ    (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     χ   (  n  )    a  n     n  s            superscript  F  χ   s     superscript   subscript     n  1          χ  n   subscript  a  n     superscript  n  s       F^{\chi}(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\chi(n)a_{n}}{n^{s}}      is also in S , then the functions F i χ are primitive elements of S (and consequently, they form the primitive factorization of F χ ).    Riemann hypothesis for S : For all F in S , the non-trivial zeroes of F all lie on the line Re( s ) = 1/2.   Consequences of the conjectures  Conjectures 1 and 2 imply that if F has a pole of order m at s = 1, then F ( s )/ζ( s ) m is entire. In particular, they imply Dedekind's conjecture. 7  M. Ram Murty showed in  that conjectures 1 and 2 imply the Artin conjecture . In fact, Murty showed that Artin L -functions corresponding to irreducible representations of the Galois group of a solvable extension of the rationals are automorphic as predicted by the Langlands conjectures . 8  The functions in S also satisfy an analogue of the prime number theorem : F ( s ) has no zeroes on the line Re( s ) = 1. As mentioned above, conjectures 1 and 2 imply the unique factorization of functions in S into primitive functions. Another consequence is that the primitivity of F is equivalent to n F = 1. 9  See also   List of zeta functions   Notes  References    Reprinted in Collected Papers, vol 2 , Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1991)             "  Category:Zeta and L-functions     ↩  ↩  ↩  The zeroes on the boundary are counted with half-multiplicity. ↩  While the ω i are not uniquely defined by F , Selberg's result shows that their sum is well-defined. ↩  ↩  A celebrated conjecture of Dedekind asserts that for any ﬁnite algebraic extension   F   F   F   of   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , the zeta function     ζ  F    (  s  )        subscript  ζ  F   s    \zeta_{F}(s)   is divisible by the Riemann zeta function    ζ   (  s  )       ζ  s    \zeta(s)   .
