   Mixing (mathematics)      Mixing (mathematics)   In mathematics , mixing is an abstract concept originating from physics : the attempt to describe the irreversible thermodynamic process of mixing in the everyday world: mixing paint, mixing drinks, etc .  The concept appears in ergodic theory ‚Äîthe study of stochastic processes and measure-preserving dynamical systems . Several different definitions for mixing exist, including strong mixing , weak mixing and topological mixing , with the last not requiring a measure to be defined. Some of the different definitions of mixing can be arranged in a hierarchical order; thus, strong mixing implies weak mixing. Furthermore, weak mixing (and thus also strong mixing) implies ergodicity : that is, every system that is weakly mixing is also ergodic (and so one says that mixing is a "stronger" notion than ergodicity).  Mixing in stochastic processes  Let     ‚ü®   X  t   ‚ü©   =   {  ‚Ä¶  ,   X   t  -  1    ,   X  t   ,   X   t  +  1    ,  ‚Ä¶  }        delimited-‚ü®‚ü©   subscript  X  t     normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  X    t  1     subscript  X  t    subscript  X    t  1    normal-‚Ä¶     \langle X_{t}\rangle=\{\ldots,X_{t-1},X_{t},X_{t+1},\ldots\}   be a sequence of random variables . Such a sequence is naturally endowed with a topology, the product topology . The open sets of this topology are called cylinder sets . These cylinder sets generate a sigma algebra , the Borel sigma algebra ; it is the smallest (coarsest) sigma algebra that contains the topology. ''' '''Define a function    Œ±   (  s  )       Œ±  s    \alpha(s)   , called the strong mixing coefficient , as        Œ±   (  s  )    ‚â°   sup   {   |    P   (   A  ‚à©  B   )    -   P   (  A  )   P   (  B  )     |   :     -  ‚àû   <  t  <  ‚àû   ,    A  ‚àà   X   -  ‚àû   t    ,   B  ‚àà    X   t  +  s   ‚àû       }     .

The symbol    X  a  b     superscript   subscript  X  a   b    X_{a}^{b}   , with     -  ‚àû   ‚â§  a  ‚â§  b  ‚â§  ‚àû            a       b           -\infty\leq a\leq b\leq\infty   denotes a subalgebra of the sigma algebra; it is the set of cylinder sets that are specified between times a and b . Given specific, fixed values    X  a     subscript  X  a    X_{a}   ,    X   a  +  1      subscript  X    a  1     X_{a+1}   , etc. , of the random variable, at times   a   a   a   ,    a  +  1      a  1    a+1   , etc. , then it may be thought of as the sigma-algebra generated by       {   X  a   ,   X   a  +  1    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   X  b   }   .      subscript  X  a    subscript  X    a  1    normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  X  b     \{X_{a},X_{a+1},\ldots,X_{b}\}.     The process    ‚ü®   X  t   ‚ü©     delimited-‚ü®‚ü©   subscript  X  t     \langle X_{t}\rangle   is strong mixing if     Œ±   (  s  )    ‚Üí  0     normal-‚Üí    Œ±  s   0    \alpha(s)\rightarrow 0   as    s  ‚Üí  ‚àû     normal-‚Üí  s     s\rightarrow\infty   .  One way to describe this is that strong mixing implies that for any two possible states of the system (realizations of the random variable), when given a sufficient amount of time between the two states, the occurrence of the states is independent .  Types of mixing  Suppose { X t } is a stationary Markov process , with stationary distribution Q . Denote L ¬≤( Q ) the space of Borel-measurable functions that are square-integrable with respect to measure Q . Also let E[ œï ( X t )‚Äâ{{!}} X 0 {{=}} x ]}} denote the conditional expectation operator on L ¬≤( Q ). Finally, let } denote the space of square-integrable functions with mean zero.  The œÅ -mixing coefficients of the process { x t } are        œÅ  t   =    sup    œï  ‚àà  Z   :     ‚à•  œï  ‚à•   2   =  1       ‚à•    ‚Ñ∞  t   œï   ‚à•   2     .       subscript  œÅ  t     subscript  supremum   normal-:    œï  Z      subscript   norm  œï   2   1      subscript   norm     subscript  ‚Ñ∞  t   œï    2      \rho_{t}=\sup_{\phi\in Z:\,\|\phi\|_{2}=1}\|\mathcal{E}_{t}\phi\|_{2}.   The process is called œÅ -mixing if these coefficients converge to zero as , and ‚ÄúœÅ-mixing with exponential decay rate‚Äù if for some . For a stationary Markov process, the coefficients œÅ t may either decay at an exponential rate, or be always equal to one. 1  The Œ± -mixing coefficients of the process { x t } are        Œ±  t   =    sup    œï  ‚àà  Z   :     ‚à•  œï  ‚à•   ‚àû   =  1       ‚à•    ‚Ñ∞  t   œï   ‚à•   1     .       subscript  Œ±  t     subscript  supremum   normal-:    œï  Z      subscript   norm  œï     1      subscript   norm     subscript  ‚Ñ∞  t   œï    1      \alpha_{t}=\sup_{\phi\in Z:\,\|\phi\|_{\infty}=1}\|\mathcal{E}_{t}\phi\|_{1}.   The process is called Œ± -mixing if these coefficients converge to zero as , it is ‚ÄúŒ±-mixing with exponential decay rate‚Äù if for some , and it is ‚ÄúŒ±-mixing with sub-exponential decay rate‚Äù if for some non-increasing function Œæ ( t ) satisfying as . 2  The Œ± -mixing coefficients are always smaller than the œÅ -mixing ones: , therefore if the process is œÅ -mixing, it will necessarily be Œ± -mixing too. However when 1}} , the process may still be Œ± -mixing, with sub-exponential decay rate.  The Œ≤ -mixing coefficients are given by        Œ≤  t   =   ‚à´    sup   0  ‚â§  œï  ‚â§  1      |     ‚Ñ∞  t   œï   (  x  )    -   ‚à´   œï  d  Q     |   d  Q      .       subscript  Œ≤  t       subscript  supremum      0  œï       1              subscript  ‚Ñ∞  t   œï  x       œï  d  Q      d  Q       \beta_{t}=\int\sup_{0\leq\phi\leq 1}\Big|\mathcal{E}_{t}\phi(x)-\int\phi dQ%
 \Big|dQ.   The process is called Œ≤ -mixing if these coefficients converge to zero as , it is ‚ÄúŒ≤-mixing with exponential decay rate‚Äù if for some , and it is ‚ÄúŒ≤-mixing with sub-exponential decay rate‚Äù if as  for some non-increasing function Œæ ( t ) satisfying as . 3  A strictly stationary Markov process is Œ≤ -mixing if and only if it is an aperiodic recurrent Harris chain . The Œ≤ -mixing coefficients are always bigger than the Œ± -mixing ones, so if a process is Œ≤ -mixing it will also be Œ± -mixing. There is no direct relationship between Œ≤ -mixing and œÅ -mixing: neither of them implies the other.  Mixing in dynamical systems  A similar definition can be given using the vocabulary of measure-preserving dynamical systems . Let    (  X  ,  ùíú  ,  Œº  ,  T  )     X  ùíú  Œº  T    (X,\mathcal{A},\mu,T)   be a dynamical system, with T being the time-evolution or shift operator . The system is said to be strong mixing if, for any     A  ,  B   ‚àà  ùíú       A  B   ùíú    A,B\in\mathcal{A}   , one has        lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû     Œº   (   A  ‚à©    T   -  n    B    )     =   Œº   (  A  )   Œº   (  B  )          subscript    normal-‚Üí  n       Œº    A     superscript  T    n    B        Œº  A  Œº  B     \lim_{n\to\infty}\mu(A\cap T^{-n}B)=\mu(A)\mu(B)   .  For shifts parametrized by a continuous variable instead of a discrete integer n , the same definition applies, with    T   -  n      superscript  T    n     T^{-n}   replaced by    T  g     subscript  T  g    T_{g}   with g being the continuous-time parameter.  To understand the above definition physically, consider a shaker   M   M   M   full of an incompressible liquid, which consists of 20% wine and 80% water. If   A   A   A   is the region originally occupied by the wine, then, for any part   B   B   B   of the shaker, the percentage of wine in   B   B   B   after n repetitions of the act of stirring is        Œº   (     T  n   A   ‚à©  B   )     Œº   (  B  )     .        Œº       superscript  T  n   A   B      Œº  B     \frac{\mu\left(T^{n}A\cap B\right)}{\mu\left(B\right)}.     In such a situation, one would expect that after the liquid is sufficiently stirred (    n  ‚Üí  ‚àû     normal-‚Üí  n     n\rightarrow\infty   ), every part   B   B   B   of the shaker will contain approximately 20% wine. This leads to        lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû      Œº   (     T  n   A   ‚à©  B   )     Œº   (  B  )      =    Œº   (  A  )     Œº   (  M  )     =   Œº   (  A  )            subscript    normal-‚Üí  n         Œº       superscript  T  n   A   B      Œº  B         Œº  A     Œº  M           Œº  A      \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{\mu\left(T^{n}A\cap B\right)}{\mu\left(B\right)%
 }=\frac{\mu\left(A\right)}{\mu\left(M\right)}=\mu\left(A\right)   ,  where     Œº   (  M  )    =  1        Œº  M   1    \mu(M)=1   , because measure-preserving dynamical systems are defined on probability spaces, and hence the final expression implies the above definition of strong mixing.  A dynamical system is said to be weak mixing if one has        lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû      1  n     ‚àë   k  =  0    n  -  1     |    Œº   (   A  ‚à©    T   -  k    B    )    -   Œº   (  A  )   Œº   (  B  )     |      =  0.        subscript    normal-‚Üí  n         1  n     superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1          Œº    A     superscript  T    k    B       Œº  A  Œº  B        0.    \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}|\mu(A\cap T^{-k}B)-\mu(A)\mu(B)|=0.     In other words,   T   T   T   is strong mixing if     Œº   (   A  ‚à©    T   -  n    B    )    -   Œº   (  A  )   Œº   (  B  )          Œº    A     superscript  T    n    B       Œº  A  Œº  B     \mu(A\cap T^{-n}B)-\mu(A)\mu(B)   converges towards   0   0    in the usual sense, weak mixing if    |    Œº   (   A  ‚à©    T   -  n    B    )    -   Œº   (  A  )   Œº   (  B  )     |          Œº    A     superscript  T    n    B       Œº  A  Œº  B      |\mu(A\cap T^{-n}B)-\mu(A)\mu(B)|   converges towards   0   0    in the Ces√†ro sense, and ergodic if     Œº   (   A  ‚à©    T   -  n    B    )    -   Œº   (  A  )   Œº   (  B  )          Œº    A     superscript  T    n    B       Œº  A  Œº  B     \mu(A\cap T^{-n}B)-\mu(A)\mu(B)   converges towards   0   0    in the Ces√†ro sense. Hence, strong mixing implies weak mixing, which implies ergodicity. However, the converse is not true: there exist ergodic dynamical systems which are not weakly mixing, and weakly mixing dynamical systems which are not strongly mixing.  For a system that is weak mixing, the shift operator  T will have no (non-constant) square-integrable  eigenfunctions with associated eigenvalue of one. In general, a shift operator will have a continuous spectrum , and thus will always have eigenfunctions that are generalized functions . However, for the system to be (at least) weak mixing, none of the eigenfunctions with associated eigenvalue of one can be square integrable.      L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   formulation  The properties of ergodicity, weak mixing and strong mixing of a measure-preserving dynamical system can also be characterized by the average of observables. By von Neumann's ergodic theorem, ergodicity of a dynamical system    (  X  ,  ùíú  ,  Œº  ,  T  )     X  ùíú  Œº  T    (X,\mathcal{A},\mu,T)   is equivalent to the property that, for any function    f  ‚àà    L  2    (  X  ,  Œº  )        f     superscript  L  2    X  Œº      f\in L^{2}(X,\mu)   , the sequence     (   f  ‚àò   T  n    )    n  ‚â•  0      subscript    f   superscript  T  n      n  0     (f\circ T^{n})_{n\geq 0}   converges strongly and in the sense of Ces√†ro to     ‚à´  X    f  d  Œº       subscript   X     f  d  Œº     \int_{X}fd\mu   , i.e.,        lim   N  ‚Üí  ‚àû      ‚à•     1  N     ‚àë   n  =  0    N  -  1     f  ‚àò   T  n      -    ‚à´  X    f  d  Œº     ‚à•     L  2    (  X  ,  Œº  )      =  0.        subscript    normal-‚Üí  N      subscript   norm        1  N     superscript   subscript     n  0      N  1      f   superscript  T  n        subscript   X     f  d  Œº         superscript  L  2    X  Œº      0.    \lim_{N\to\infty}\|{1\over N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}f\circ T^{n}-\int_{X}fd\mu\|_{L^{%

Since the system is assumed to be measure preserving, this last line is equivalent to saying that      lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû     C  o  v   (   f  ‚àò   T  n    ,  g  )     =  0        subscript    normal-‚Üí  n       C  o  v     f   superscript  T  n    g     0    \lim_{n\to\infty}Cov(f\circ T^{n},g)=0   , so that the random variables    f  ‚àò   T  n       f   superscript  T  n     f\circ T^{n}   and   g   g   g   become orthogonal as   n   n   n   grows. Actually, since this works for any function   g   g   g   , one can informally see mixing as the property that the random variables    f  ‚àò   T  n       f   superscript  T  n     f\circ T^{n}   and   g   g   g   become independent as   n   n   n   grows.  Products of dynamical systems  Given two measured dynamical system    (  X  ,  Œº  ,  T  )     X  Œº  T    (X,\mu,T)   and    (  Y  ,  Œº  ,  S  )     Y  Œº  S    (Y,\mu,S)   , one can construct a dynamical system    (   X  √ó  Y   ,   Œº  ‚äó  ŒΩ   ,   T  √ó  S   )       X  Y    tensor-product  Œº  ŒΩ     T  S     (X\times Y,\mu\otimes\nu,T\times S)   on the Cartesian product by defining      (   T  √ó  S   )    (  x  ,  y  )    =   (   T   (  x  )    ,   S   (  y  )    )           T  S    x  y       T  x     S  y      (T\times S)(x,y)=(T(x),S(y))   . We then have the following characterizations of weak mixing:  Proposition : A dynamical system    (  X  ,  Œº  ,  T  )     X  Œº  T    (X,\mu,T)   is weakly mixing if and only if, for any ergodic dynamical system    (  Y  ,  Œº  ,  S  )     Y  Œº  S    (Y,\mu,S)   , the system    (   X  √ó  Y   ,   Œº  ‚äó  ŒΩ   ,   T  √ó  S   )       X  Y    tensor-product  Œº  ŒΩ     T  S     (X\times Y,\mu\otimes\nu,T\times S)   is also ergodic.  Proposition : A dynamical system    (  X  ,  Œº  ,  T  )     X  Œº  T    (X,\mu,T)   is weakly mixing if and only if    (   X  2   ,   Œº  ‚äó  Œº   ,   T  √ó  T   )      superscript  X  2    tensor-product  Œº  Œº     T  T     (X^{2},\mu\otimes\mu,T\times T)   is also ergodic. If this is the case, then    (   X  2   ,   Œº  ‚äó  Œº   ,   T  √ó  T   )      superscript  X  2    tensor-product  Œº  Œº     T  T     (X^{2},\mu\otimes\mu,T\times T)   is also weakly mixing.  Generalizations  The definition given above is sometimes called strong 2-mixing , to distinguish it from higher orders of mixing. A strong 3-mixing system may be defined as a system for which        lim    m  ,  n   ‚Üí  ‚àû     Œº   (   A  ‚à©    T   -  m    B   ‚à©    T    -  m   -  n    C    )     =   Œº   (  A  )   Œº   (  B  )   Œº   (  C  )          subscript    normal-‚Üí   m  n        Œº    A     superscript  T    m    B      superscript  T      m   n    C        Œº  A  Œº  B  Œº  C     \lim_{m,n\to\infty}\mu(A\cap T^{-m}B\cap T^{-m-n}C)=\mu(A)\mu(B)\mu(C)     holds for all measurable sets A , B , C . We can define strong k-mixing similarly. A system which is strong k-mixing for all k=2,3,4,... is called mixing of all orders .  It is unknown whether strong 2-mixing implies strong 3-mixing. It is known that strong m -mixing implies ergodicity .  Examples  Irrational rotations of the circle, and more generally irreducible translations on a torus, are ergodic but neither strongly nor weakly mixing with respect to the Lebesgue measure.  Many map considered as chaotic are strongly mixing for some well-chosen invariant measure, including: the dyadic map , Arnold's cat map , horseshoe maps , Kolmogorov automorphisms , the geodesic flow on the unit tangent bundle of compact surfaces of negative curvature...  Topological mixing  A form of mixing may be defined without appeal to a measure , only using the topology of the system. A continuous map     f  :   X  ‚Üí  X      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  X     f:X\to X   is said to be topologically transitive if, for every pair of non-empty open sets      A  ,  B   ‚äÇ  X       A  B   X    A,B\subset X   , there exists an integer n such that         f  n    (  A  )    ‚à©  B   ‚â†  ‚àÖ           superscript  f  n   A   B      f^{n}(A)\cap B\neq\varnothing     where    f  n     superscript  f  n    f^{n}   is the n th iterate of f . In the operator theory , a topologically transitive bounded linear operator (a continuous linear map on a topological vector space ) is usually called hypercyclic operator . A related idea is expressed by the wandering set .  Lemma: If X is a complete  metric space with no isolated point , then f is topologically transitive if and only if there exists a hypercyclic point     x  ‚àà  X      x  X    x\in X   , that is, a point x such that its orbit    {    f  n    (  x  )    :   n  ‚àà  ‚Ñï   }     conditional-set     superscript  f  n   x     n  ‚Ñï     \{f^{n}(x):n\in\mathbb{N}\}   is dense in X .  A system is said to be topologically mixing if, given open sets   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   , there exists an integer N , such that, for all    n  >  N      n  N    n>N   , one has         f  n    (  A  )    ‚à©  B   ‚â†  ‚àÖ           superscript  f  n   A   B      f^{n}(A)\cap B\neq\varnothing   .  For a continuous-time system,    f  n     superscript  f  n    f^{n}   is replaced by the flow     œï  g     subscript  œï  g    \phi_{g}   , with g being the continuous parameter, with the requirement that a non-empty intersection hold for all     ‚à•  g  ‚à•   >  N       norm  g   N    \|g\|>N   .  A weak topological mixing is one that has no non-constant continuous (with respect to the topology) eigenfunctions of the shift operator.  Topological mixing neither implies, nor is implied by either weak or strong mixing: there are examples of systems that are weak mixing but not topologically mixing, and examples that are topologically mixing but not strong mixing.
