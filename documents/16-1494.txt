   Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem      Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem   In formal language theory , the Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem is a theorem derived by Noam Chomsky and Marcel-Paul Schützenberger about representing a given context-free language in terms of two simpler languages. These two simpler languages, namely a regular language and a Dyck language , are combined by means of an intersection and a homomorphism .  A few notions from formal language theory are in order. A context-free language is regular , if can be described by a regular expression , or, equivalently, if it is accepted by a finite automaton . A homomorphism is based on a function   h   h   h   which maps symbols from an alphabet   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   to words over another alphabet   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   ; If the domain of this function is extended to words over   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   in the natural way, by letting     h   (   x  y   )    =   h   (  x  )   h   (  y  )          h    x  y      h  x  h  y     h(xy)=h(x)h(y)   for all words   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   , this yields a homomorphism     h  :    Γ  *   →   Σ  *       normal-:  h   normal-→   superscript  normal-Γ     superscript  normal-Σ       h:\Gamma^{*}\to\Sigma^{*}   . A matched alphabet     T  ∪   T  ¯       T   normal-¯  T     T\cup\overline{T}   is an alphabet with two equal-sized sets; it is convenient to think of it as a set of parentheses types, where   T   T   T   contains the opening parenthesis symbols, whereas the symbols in    T  ¯     normal-¯  T    \overline{T}   contains the closing parenthesis symbols. For a matched alphabet    T  ∪   T  ¯       T   normal-¯  T     T\cup\overline{T}   , the Dyck language     D  T     subscript  D  T    D_{T}   is given by       D  T   =   {   w  ∈    (   T  ∪   T  ¯    )   *    ∣   w   is a correctly nested sequence of parentheses    }        subscript  D  T    conditional-set    w   superscript    T   normal-¯  T         w  is a correctly nested sequence of parentheses      D_{T}=\{\,w\in(T\cup\overline{T})^{*}\mid w\text{ is a correctly nested %
 sequence of parentheses}\,\}   words that are well-nested parentheses over    T  ∪   T  ¯       T   normal-¯  T     T\cup\overline{T}   .   Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem . A language L over the alphabet   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   is context-free if and only if there exists  a matched alphabet    T  ∪   T  ¯       T   normal-¯  T     T\cup\overline{T}     a regular language   R   R   R   over    T  ∪   T  ¯       T   normal-¯  T     T\cup\overline{T}   ,  and a homomorphism    h  :     (   T  ∪   T  ¯    )   *   →   Σ  *       normal-:  h   normal-→   superscript    T   normal-¯  T       superscript  normal-Σ       h:(T\cup\overline{T})^{*}\to\Sigma^{*}       such that    L  =   h   (    D  T   ∩  R   )        L    h     subscript  D  T   R      L=h(D_{T}\cap R)   .
