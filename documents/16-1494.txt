Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem

In formal language theory, the Chomsky–Schützenberger representation theorem is a theorem derived by Noam Chomsky and Marcel-Paul Schützenberger about representing a given context-free language in terms of two simpler languages. These two simpler languages, namely a regular language and a Dyck language, are combined by means of an intersection and a homomorphism.
A few notions from formal language theory are in order. A context-free language is regular, if can be described by a regular expression, or, equivalently, if it is accepted by a finite automaton. A homomorphism is based on a function 
 
 
 
  which maps symbols from an alphabet 
 
 
 
  to words over another alphabet 
 
 
 
 ; If the domain of this function is extended to words over 
 
 
 
  in the natural way, by letting 
 
 
 
  for all words 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , this yields a homomorphism

 
 . A matched alphabet

 
  is an alphabet with two equal-sized sets; it is convenient to think of it as a set of parentheses types, where 
 
 
 
  contains the opening parenthesis symbols, whereas the symbols in 
 
 
 
  contains the closing parenthesis symbols. For a matched alphabet 
 
 
 
 , the Dyck language

 
  is given by


 
  words that are well-nested parentheses over 
 
 
 
 .

Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem. A language L over the alphabet 
 
 
 
  is context-free if and only if there exists
 
a matched alphabet 
 
 

a regular language
