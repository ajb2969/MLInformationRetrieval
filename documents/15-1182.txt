Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase

Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (, sophoradiol 24-hydroxylase, CYP93E1) is an enzyme with system name beta-amyrin,AH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (24-hydroxylating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) beta-amyrin + AH2 + O2

 
  24-hydroxy-beta-amyrin + A + H2O
 
(2) sophoradiol + AH2 + O2

 
  24-hydroxysophoradiol + A + H2O
 

Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase is heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
