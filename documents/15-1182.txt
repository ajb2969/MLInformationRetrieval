   Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase      Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase   Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase (, sophoradiol 24-hydroxylase , CYP93E1 ) is an enzyme with system name beta-amyrin,AH2:oxygen oxidoreductase (24-hydroxylating) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) beta-amyrin + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   24-hydroxy-beta-amyrin + A + H 2 O  (2) sophoradiol + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   24-hydroxysophoradiol + A + H 2 O   Beta-amyrin 24-hydroxylase is heme - thiolate protein (P-450).
