   Comb filter      Comb filter   In signal processing , a comb filter adds a delayed version of a signal to itself, causing constructive and destructive interference . The frequency response of a comb filter consists of a series of regularly spaced spikes, giving the appearance of a comb .  Applications  Comb filters are used in a variety of signal processing applications. These include:   Cascaded integrator–comb (CIC) filters, commonly used for anti-aliasing during interpolation and decimation operations that change the sample rate of a discrete-time system.  2D and 3D comb filters implemented in hardware (and occasionally software) for PAL and NTSC television decoders. The filters work to reduce artifacts such as dot crawl .  Audio effects , including echo , flanging , and digital waveguide synthesis . For instance, if the delay is set to a few milliseconds, a comb filter can be used to model the effect of acoustic  standing waves in a cylindrical cavity or in a vibrating string .  In astronomy the astro-comb promises to increase the precision of existing spectrographs by nearly a hundredfold.   In acoustics , comb filtering can arise in some unwanted ways. For instance, when two loudspeakers are playing the same signal at different distances from the listener, there is a comb filtering effect on the signal. 1 In any enclosed space, listeners hear a mixture of direct sound and reflected sound. Because the reflected sound takes a longer path, it constitutes a delayed version of the direct sound and a comb filter is created where the two combine at the listener. 2  Technical discussion  Comb filters exist in two different forms, feedforward and feedback ; the names refer to the direction in which signals are delayed before they are added to the input.  Comb filters may be implemented in discrete time or continuous time ; this article will focus on discrete-time implementations; the properties of the continuous-time comb filter are very similar.  Feedforward form  (Figure)  Feedforward comb filter structure   The general structure of a feedforward comb filter is shown on the right. It may be described by the following difference equation :        y    [  n  ]    =    x   [  n  ]    +   α  x   [   n  -  K   ]           y   delimited-[]  n        x   delimited-[]  n      α  x   delimited-[]    n  K        \ y[n]=x[n]+\alpha x[n-K]\,     where   K   K   K   is the delay length (measured in samples), and   α   α   \alpha   is a scaling factor applied to the delayed signal. If we take the Z transform of both sides of the equation, we obtain:        Y    (  z  )    =    (   1  +   α   z   -  K      )   X   (  z  )          Y  z       1    α   superscript  z    K      X  z     \ Y(z)=(1+\alpha z^{-K})X(z)\,     We define the transfer function as:        H    (  z  )    =    Y   (  z  )     X   (  z  )     =   1  +   α   z   -  K      =      z  K   +  α    z  K             H  z       Y  z     X  z           1    α   superscript  z    K                superscript  z  K   α    superscript  z  K       \ H(z)=\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}=1+\alpha z^{-K}=\frac{z^{K}+\alpha}{z^{K}}\,     Frequency response    To obtain the frequency response of a discrete-time system expressed in the Z domain, we make the substitution    z  =   e   j  Ω        z   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω      z=e^{j\Omega}   . Therefore, for our feedforward comb filter, we get:        H    (   e   j  Ω    )    =   1  +   α    e   -   j  Ω  K              H   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω       1    α   superscript  e      j  normal-Ω  K         \ H(e^{j\Omega})=1+\alpha e^{-j\Omega K}\,     Using Euler's formula , we find that the frequency response is also given by        H    (   e   j  Ω    )    =    [   1  +   α   cos   (   Ω  K   )      ]   -   j  α   sin   (   Ω  K   )            H   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω        delimited-[]    1    α      normal-Ω  K         j  α      normal-Ω  K        \ H(e^{j\Omega})=\left[1+\alpha\cos(\Omega K)\right]-j\alpha\sin(\Omega K)\,     Often of interest is the magnitude response, which ignores phase. This is defined as:       |   H   (   e   j  Ω    )    |   =     ℜ    {  H   (   e   j  Ω    )   }   2   +  ℑ    {  H   (   e   j  Ω    )   }   2              H   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω         fragments    superscript   fragments  normal-{  H   fragments  normal-(   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω    normal-)   normal-}   2      superscript   fragments  normal-{  H   fragments  normal-(   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω    normal-)   normal-}   2       \ |H(e^{j\Omega})|=\sqrt{\Re\{H(e^{j\Omega})\}^{2}+\Im\{H(e^{j\Omega})\}^{2}}\,     In the case of the feedforward comb filter, this is:       |   H   (   e   j  Ω    )    |   =      (   1  +   α  2    )   +   2  α   cos   (   Ω  K   )                H   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω            1   superscript  α  2      2  α      normal-Ω  K         \ |H(e^{j\Omega})|=\sqrt{(1+\alpha^{2})+2\alpha\cos(\Omega K)}\,     Notice that the    (   1  +   α  2    )      1   superscript  α  2     (1+\alpha^{2})   term is constant, whereas the    2  α   cos   (   Ω  K   )        2  α      normal-Ω  K      2\alpha\cos(\Omega K)   term varies periodically . Hence the magnitude response of the comb filter is periodic.  The graphs to the right show the magnitude response for various values of   α   α   \alpha   , demonstrating this periodicity. Some important properties:   The response periodically drops to a local minimum (sometimes known as a notch ), and periodically rises to a local maximum (sometimes known as a peak ).  For positive values of   α   α   \alpha   , the first minimum occurs at half the delay period and repeat at even multiples of the delay frequency thereafter    f  =    1   2  K    ,   3   2  K    ,    5   2  K    …        f     1    2  K      3    2  K        5    2  K    normal-…      f=\frac{1}{2K},\frac{3}{2K},\frac{5}{2K}...   .  The levels of the maxima and minima are always equidistant from 1.  When    α  =   ±  1       α   plus-or-minus  1     \alpha=\pm 1   , the minima have zero amplitude. In this case, the minima are sometimes known as nulls .  The maxima for positive values of   α   α   \alpha   coincide with the minima for negative values of   α   α   \alpha   , and vice versa.   Impulse response  The feedforward comb filter is one of the simplest finite impulse response filters. 3 Its response is simply the initial impulse with a second impulse after the delay.  Pole–zero interpretation  Looking again at the Z-domain transfer function of the feedforward comb filter:        H    (  z  )    =      z  K   +  α    z  K           H  z        superscript  z  K   α    superscript  z  K      \ H(z)=\frac{z^{K}+\alpha}{z^{K}}\,     we see that the numerator is equal to zero whenever     z  K   =   -  α        superscript  z  K     α     z^{K}=-\alpha   . This has   K   K   K   solutions, equally spaced around a circle in the complex plane ; these are the zeros of the transfer function. The denominator is zero at     z  K   =  0       superscript  z  K   0    z^{K}=0   , giving   K   K   K    poles at    z  =  0      z  0    z=0   . This leads to a pole–zero plot like the ones shown below.     (Figure)  Pole–zero plot of feedfoward comb filter with    K  =  8      K  8    K=8   and    α  =  0.5      α  0.5    \alpha=0.5      (Figure)  Pole–zero plot of feedfoward comb filter with    K  =  8      K  8    K=8   and    α  =   -  0.5       α    0.5     \alpha=-0.5         Feedback form  (Figure)  Feedback comb filter structure   Similarly, the general structure of a feedback comb filter is shown on the right. It may be described by the following difference equation :        y    [  n  ]    =    x   [  n  ]    +   α  y   [   n  -  K   ]           y   delimited-[]  n        x   delimited-[]  n      α  y   delimited-[]    n  K        \ y[n]=x[n]+\alpha y[n-K]\,     If we rearrange this equation so that all terms in   y   y   y   are on the left-hand side, and then take the Z transform, we obtain:        (   1  -   α   z   -  K      )   Y   (  z  )    =   X   (  z  )            1    α   superscript  z    K      Y  z     X  z     \ (1-\alpha z^{-K})Y(z)=X(z)\,     The transfer function is therefore:        H    (  z  )    =    Y   (  z  )     X   (  z  )     =   1   1  -   α   z   -  K       =     z  K     z  K   -  α             H  z       Y  z     X  z           1    1    α   superscript  z    K               superscript  z  K      superscript  z  K   α       \ H(z)=\frac{Y(z)}{X(z)}=\frac{1}{1-\alpha z^{-K}}=\frac{z^{K}}{z^{K}-\alpha}\,     Frequency response    If we make the substitution    z  =   e   j  Ω        z   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω      z=e^{j\Omega}   into the Z-domain expression for the feedback comb filter, we get:        H    (   e   j  Ω    )    =    1   1  -   α   e   -   j  Ω  K               H   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω       1    1    α   superscript  e      j  normal-Ω  K          \ H(e^{j\Omega})=\frac{1}{1-\alpha e^{-j\Omega K}}\,     The magnitude response is as follows:       |   H   (   e   j  Ω    )    |   =    1     (   1  +   α  2    )   -   2  α   cos   (   Ω  K   )                 H   superscript  e    j  normal-Ω        1        1   superscript  α  2      2  α      normal-Ω  K          \ |H(e^{j\Omega})|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{(1+\alpha^{2})-2\alpha\cos(\Omega K)}}\,     Again, the response is periodic, as the graphs to the right demonstrate. The feedback comb filter has some properties in common with the feedforward form:   The response periodically drops to a local minimum and rises to a local maximum.  The maxima for positive values of   α   α   \alpha   coincide with the minima for negative values of   α   α   \alpha   , and vice versa.  For positive values of   α   α   \alpha   , the first minimum occurs at 0 and repeats at even multiples of the delay frequency thereafter    f  =   0  ,   1  K   ,    2  K   …        f   0    1  K       2  K   normal-…      f=0,\frac{1}{K},\frac{2}{K}...   .   However, there are also some important differences because the magnitude response has a term in the denominator :   The levels of the maxima and minima are no longer equidistant from 1. The maxima have an amplitude of    1   1  -  α       1    1  α     1\over 1-\alpha   .  The filter is only stable if    |  α  |      α    |\alpha|   is strictly less than 1. As can be seen from the graphs, as    |  α  |      α    |\alpha|   increases, the amplitude of the maxima rises increasingly rapidly.   Impulse response  The feedback comb filter is a simple type of infinite impulse response filter. 4 If stable, the response simply consists of a repeating series of impulses decreasing in amplitude over time.  Pole–zero interpretation  Looking again at the Z-domain transfer function of the feedback comb filter:        H    (  z  )    =     z  K     z  K   -  α           H  z      superscript  z  K      superscript  z  K   α      \ H(z)=\frac{z^{K}}{z^{K}-\alpha}\,     This time, the numerator is zero at     z  K   =  0       superscript  z  K   0    z^{K}=0   , giving   K   K   K   zeros at    z  =  0      z  0    z=0   . The denominator is equal to zero whenever     z  K   =  α       superscript  z  K   α    z^{K}=\alpha   . This has   K   K   K   solutions, equally spaced around a circle in the complex plane ; these are the poles of the transfer function. This leads to a pole–zero plot like the ones shown below.     (Figure)  Pole–zero plot of feedback comb filter with    K  =  8      K  8    K=8   and    α  =  0.5      α  0.5    \alpha=0.5      (Figure)  Pole–zero plot of feedback comb filter with    K  =  8      K  8    K=8   and    α  =   -  0.5       α    0.5     \alpha=-0.5         Continuous-time comb filters  Comb filters may also be implemented in continuous time . The feedforward form may be described by the following equation:        y    (  t  )    =    x   (  t  )    +   α  x   (   t  -  τ   )           y  t       x  t     α  x    t  τ       \ y(t)=x(t)+\alpha x(t-\tau)\,     where   τ   τ   \tau   is the delay (measured in seconds). This has the following transfer function:        H    (  s  )    =   1  +   α    e   -   s  τ              H  s     1    α   superscript  e      s  τ         \ H(s)=1+\alpha e^{-s\tau}\,     The feedforward form consists of an infinite number of zeros spaced along the jω axis.  The feedback form has the equation:        y    (  t  )    =    x   (  t  )    +   α  y   (   t  -  τ   )           y  t       x  t     α  y    t  τ       \ y(t)=x(t)+\alpha y(t-\tau)\,     and the following transfer function:        H    (  s  )    =    1   1  -   α   e   -   s  τ               H  s     1    1    α   superscript  e      s  τ          \ H(s)=\frac{1}{1-\alpha e^{-s\tau}}\,     The feedback form consists of an infinite number of poles spaced along the jω axis.  Continuous-time implementations share all the properties of the respective discrete-time implementations.
