Fixed-point subgroup

In algebra, the fixed-point subgroup

 
  of an automorphism f of a group G is the subgroup of G:



For example, take G to be the group of invertible n-by-n real matrices and 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is the group 
 
 
 
  of n-by-n orthogonal matrices.
The same definition applies to rings as well. Let R be a ring and f an automorphism of R. Then the '''subring fixed by ''' f is the subring of R:



Slightly more generally, if G is a subgroup of the automorphism group

 
  of R, then 
 
 
 
 , the intersection of 
 
 
 
  is a subring called the subring fixed by H or, more commonly, the ring of invariants. A basic example appears in Galois theory; see Fundamental theorem of Galois theory.
