   Fixed-point subgroup      Fixed-point subgroup   In algebra, the fixed-point subgroup     G  f     superscript  G  f    G^{f}   of an automorphism f of a group  G is the subgroup of G :        G  f   =   {   g  ∈  G   ∣    f   (  g  )    =  g   }    .       superscript  G  f    conditional-set    g  G       f  g   g      G^{f}=\{g\in G\mid f(g)=g\}.     For example, take G to be the group of invertible n -by- n real matrices and     f   (  g  )    =    (   g  T   )    -  1          f  g    superscript   superscript  g  T     1      f(g)=(g^{T})^{-1}   . Then    G  f     superscript  G  f    G^{f}   is the group    O   (  n  )       O  n    O(n)   of n -by- n  orthogonal matrices .  The same definition applies to rings as well. Let R be a ring and f an automorphism of R . Then the '''subring fixed by ''' f is the subring of R :        R  f   =   {   r  ∈  R   ∣    f   (  r  )    =  r   }    .       superscript  R  f    conditional-set    r  R       f  r   r      R^{f}=\{r\in R\mid f(r)=r\}.     Slightly more generally, if G is a subgroup of the automorphism group     Aut   (  R  )      Aut  R    \operatorname{Aut}(R)   of R , then    R  G     superscript  R  G    R^{G}   , the intersection of      R  g   ,  g   ∈  G        superscript  R  g   g   G    R^{g},\,g\in G   is a subring called the subring fixed by H or, more commonly, the ring of invariants . A basic example appears in Galois theory ; see Fundamental theorem of Galois theory .  "  Category:Algebraic groups
