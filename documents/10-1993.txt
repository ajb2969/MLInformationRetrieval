   Oxalate decarboxylase      Oxalate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an oxalate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   oxalate + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formate + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are oxalate and H + , whereas its two products are formate and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is oxalate carboxy-lyase (formate-forming) . This enzyme is also called oxalate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
