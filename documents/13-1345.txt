Hilbert–Samuel function

In commutative algebra the Hilbert–Samuel function, named after David Hilbert and Pierre Samuel,1 of a nonzero finitely generated module

 
  over a commutative Noetherian local ring

 
  and a primary ideal

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is the map 
 
 
 
  such that, for all 
 
 
 
 ,



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the length over 
 
 
 
 . It is related to the Hilbert function of the associated graded module

 
  by the identity



For sufficiently large 
 
 
 
 , it coincides with a polynomial function of degree equal to 
 
 
 
 .2
Examples
For the ring of formal power series in two variables 
 
 
 
  taken as a module over itself and graded by the order and the ideal generated by the monomials x2 and y3 we have

Degree bounds
Unlike the Hilbert function, the Hilbert–Samuel function is not additive on an exact sequence. However, it is still reasonably close to being additive, as a consequence of the Artin–Rees lemma. We denote by 
 
 
 
  the Hilbert-Samuel polynomial; i.e., it coincides with the Hilbert–Samuel function for large integers.
Proof: Tensoring the given exact sequence with 
 
 
 
  and computing the kernel we get the exact sequence:


 
  which gives us:


 
 . The third term on the right can be estimated by Artin-Rees. Indeed, by the lemma, for large n and some k,


 
  Thus,


 
 . This gives the desired degree bound.
