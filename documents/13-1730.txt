Pairwise Stone space

In mathematics and particularly in topology, pairwise Stone space is a bitopological space

 
  which is pairwise compact, pairwise Hausdorff, and pairwise zero-dimensional.
Pairwise Stone spaces are a bitopological version of the Stone spaces.
Pairwise Stone spaces are closely related to spectral spaces.
Theorem:1 If 
 
 
 
  is a spectral space, then 
 
 
 
  is a pairwise Stone space, where 
 
 
 
  is the de Groot dual topology of 
 
 
 
  . Conversely, if 
 
 
 
  is a pairwise Stone space, then both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are spectral spaces.
