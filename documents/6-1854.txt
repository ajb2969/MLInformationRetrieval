   Beta Corvi      Beta Corvi   Beta Corvi ( Beta Crv , β Corvi , β Crv ) is the second brightest star in the southern constellation of Corvus . It has the traditional name Kraz . The origin and meaning of this name remains uncertain. 1 2  Naming  The Proper Name Kraz for Beta Corvi appeared in a 1951 publication, Atlas Coeli ( Skalnate Pleso Atlas of the Heavens ) by Czech astronomer Antonín Bečvář . Professor Paul Kunitzch has been unable to find any clues as to the origin of the name. 3  In Chinese,  (), meaning Chariot (asterism) , refers to an asterism consisting of β Corvi, γ Corvi , ε Corvi and δ Corvi . 4 Consequently, β Corvi itself is known as  (, .). 5  Properties  Beta Corvi has about 3.7 times the Sun's mass and is roughly 206 million years old, 6 which is old enough for a star of this mass to consume the hydrogen at its core and evolve away from the main sequence . The stellar classification is G5 II, 7 with the luminosity class of 'II' indicating this is a bright giant . The effective temperature of the star's outer envelope is about 5,100 K, 8 which produces a yellow hue common to G-type stars. 9  The measured angular diameter of this star is . 10 At an estimated distance of , 11 this yields a physical size of about 16 times the radius of the Sun . 12 13 Because of the star's mass and radius, it is emitting about 164 times the luminosity of the Sun . 14 The abundance of elements other than hydrogen or helium, what astronomers term metallicity , is similar to the proportions in the Sun . 15  This is a variable star that ranges in apparent visual magnitude from a low of 2.66 to a high of 2.60. 16  See also   A Carinae  Rho² Cancri  Beta Corvi in fiction   References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 32\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 17  18  19  20  21  22  }}  "  Category:Corvus (constellation)  Category:G-type bright giants  Corvi, 9  Corvi, Beta  109379  061359  BD-22 3401  Category:Stars with proper names       ↩   中國星座神話 , written by 陳久金.
