   Algebraic extension      Algebraic extension   In abstract algebra , a field extension  L / K is called algebraic if every element of L is algebraic over K , i.e. if every element of L is a root of some non-zero polynomial with coefficients in K . Field extensions that are not algebraic, i.e. which contain transcendental elements , are called transcendental .  For example, the field extension R / Q , that is the field of real numbers as an extension of the field of rational numbers , is transcendental, while the field extensions C / R and Q (√2)/ Q are algebraic, where C is the field of complex numbers .  All transcendental extensions are of infinite degree . This in turn implies that all finite extensions are algebraic. 1 The converse is not true however: there are infinite extensions which are algebraic. For instance, the field of all algebraic numbers is an infinite algebraic extension of the rational numbers.  If a is algebraic over K , then K [ a ], the set of all polynomials in a with coefficients in K , is not only a ring but a field: an algebraic extension of K which has finite degree over K . The converse is true as well, if K [ a ] is a field, then a is algebraic over K . In the special case where K = Q is the field of rational numbers , Q [ a ] is an example of an algebraic number field .  A field with no nontrivial algebraic extensions is called algebraically closed . An example is the field of complex numbers . Every field has an algebraic extension which is algebraically closed (called its algebraic closure ), but proving this in general requires some form of the axiom of choice .  An extension L / K is algebraic if and only if every sub K -algebra of L is a field .  Properties  The class of algebraic extensions forms a distinguished class of field extensions , that is, the following three properties hold: 2   If E is an algebraic extension of F and F is an algebraic extension of K then E is an algebraic extension of K .  If E and F are algebraic extensions of K in a common overfield C , then the compositum  EF is an algebraic extension of K .  If E is an algebraic extension of F and E > K > F then E is an algebraic extension of K .   These finitary results can be generalized using transfinite induction:  This fact, together with Zorn's lemma (applied to an appropriately chosen poset), establishes the existence of algebraic closures .  Generalizations  Model theory generalizes the notion of algebraic extension to arbitrary theories: an embedding of M into N is called an algebraic extension if for every x in N there is a formula p with parameters in M , such that p ( x ) is true and the set      {   y  ∈  N   |   p   (  y  )    }     conditional-set    y  N     p  y     \left\{y\in N\Big|p(y)\right\}     is finite. It turns out that applying this definition to the theory of fields gives the usual definition of algebraic extension. The Galois group of N over M can again be defined as the group of automorphisms, and it turns out that most of the theory of Galois groups can be developed for the general case.
