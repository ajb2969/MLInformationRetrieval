Hydroxycinnamate 4-beta-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a hydroxycinnamate 4-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + trans-4-hydroxycinnamate 
 
 
 
  UDP + 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-4-hydroxycinnamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and trans-4-hydroxycinnamate (p-coumaric acid), whereas its two products are UDP and 4-O-beta-D-glucosyl-4-hydroxycinnamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:trans-4-hydroxycinnamate 4-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-hydroxycinnamate glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose-hydroxycinnamate glucosyltransferase, and hydroxycinnamoyl glucosyltransferase.
