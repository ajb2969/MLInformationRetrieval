   Contraction (operator theory)      Contraction (operator theory)   In operator theory , a discipline within mathematics, a bounded operator  T : X → Y between normed vector spaces  X and Y is said to be a contraction if its operator norm || T || ≤ 1. Every bounded operator becomes a contraction after suitable scaling. The analysis of contractions provides insight into the structure of operators, or a family of operators. The theory of contractions on Hilbert space is largely due to Béla Szőkefalvi-Nagy and Ciprian Foias .  Contractions on a Hilbert space  If T is a contraction acting on a Hilbert space    ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , the following basic objects associated with T can be defined.  The defect operators of T are the operators D T = (1 − T*T ) ½ and D T* = (1 − TT* ) ½ . The square root is the positive semidefinite one given by the spectral theorem . The defect spaces     𝒟  T     subscript  𝒟  T    \mathcal{D}_{T}   and    𝒟   T  *      subscript  𝒟   T      \mathcal{D}_{T*}   are the ranges Ran( D T ) and Ran( D T* ) respectively. The positive operator D T induces an inner product on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   . The inner product space can be identified naturally with Ran( D T ). A similar statement holds for    𝒟   T  *      subscript  𝒟   T      \mathcal{D}_{T*}   .  The defect indices of T are the pair       (   dim   𝒟  T    ,   dim   𝒟   T  *     )   .      dimension   subscript  𝒟  T     dimension   subscript  𝒟   superscript  T        (\dim\mathcal{D}_{T},\dim\mathcal{D}_{T^{*}}).     The defect operators and the defect indices are a measure of the non-unitarity of T .  A contraction T on a Hilbert space can be canonically decomposed into an orthogonal direct sum      T  =   Γ  ⊕  U       T   direct-sum  normal-Γ  U     T=\Gamma\oplus U     where U is a unitary operator and Γ is completely non-unitary in the sense that it has no reducing subspaces on which its restriction is unitary. If U = 0, T is said to be a completely non-unitary contraction . A special case of this decomposition is the Wold decomposition for an isometry , where Γ is a proper isometry.  Contractions on Hilbert spaces can be viewed as the operator analogs of cos θ and are called operator angles in some contexts. The explicit description of contractions leads to (operator-)parametrizations of positive and unitary matrices.  Dilation theorem for contractions  Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem , proved in 1953, states that for any contraction T on a Hilbert space H , there is a unitary operator  U on a larger Hilbert space K ⊇ H such that if P is the orthogonal projection of K onto H then T n = P  U n  P for all n > 0. The operator U is called a dilation of T and is uniquely determined if U is minimal, i.e. K is the smallest closed subspace invariant under U and U * containing H .  In fact define 1       ℋ  =   H  ⊕  H  ⊕  H  ⊕  ⋯    ,      ℋ   direct-sum  H  H  H  normal-⋯     \displaystyle{\mathcal{H}=H\oplus H\oplus H\oplus\cdots,}     the orthogonal direct sum of countably many copies of H .  Let V be the isometry on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   defined by        V   (   ξ  1   ,   ξ  2   ,   ξ  3   ,  …  )    =   (   T   ξ  1    ,     I  -    T  *   T      ξ  1    ,   ξ  2   ,   ξ  3   ,  …  )    .        V    subscript  ξ  1    subscript  ξ  2    subscript  ξ  3   normal-…       T   subscript  ξ  1          I     superscript  T    T      subscript  ξ  1     subscript  ξ  2    subscript  ξ  3   normal-…     \displaystyle{V(\xi_{1},\xi_{2},\xi_{3},\dots)=(T\xi_{1},\sqrt{I-T^{*}T}\xi_{1%
 },\xi_{2},\xi_{3},\dots).}     Let       𝒦  =   ℋ  ⊕  ℋ    .      𝒦   direct-sum  ℋ  ℋ     \displaystyle{\mathcal{K}=\mathcal{H}\oplus\mathcal{H}.}     Define a unitary W on   𝒦   𝒦   \mathcal{K}   by        W   (  x  ,  y  )    =   (    V  x   +    (   I  -   V   V  *     )   y    ,   -    V  *   y    )    .        W   x  y         V  x       I    V   superscript  V      y         superscript  V    y       \displaystyle{W(x,y)=(Vx+(I-VV^{*})y,-V^{*}y).}     W is then a unitary dilation of T with H considered as the first component of    ℋ  ⊂  𝒦      ℋ  𝒦    \mathcal{H}\subset\mathcal{K}   .  The minimal dilation U is obtained by taking the restriction of W to the closed subspace generated by powers of W applied to H .  Dilation theorem for contraction semigroups  There is an alternative proof of Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem, which allows significant generalisations. 2  Let G be a group, U ( g ) a unitary representation of G on a Hilbert space K and P an orthogonal projection onto a closed subspace H = PK of K .  The operator-valued function        Φ   (  g  )    =   P  U   (  g  )   P    ,        normal-Φ  g     P  U  g  P     \displaystyle{\Phi(g)=PU(g)P,}     with values in operators on K satisfies the positive-definiteness condition        ∑    λ  i     λ  j   ¯   Φ   (    g  j   -  1     g  i    )     =   P   T  *   T  P   ≥  0   ,             subscript  λ  i    normal-¯   subscript  λ  j    normal-Φ     superscript   subscript  g  j     1     subscript  g  i        P   superscript  T    T  P        0     \sum\lambda_{i}\overline{\lambda_{j}}\Phi(g_{j}^{-1}g_{i})=PT^{*}TP\geq 0,     where       T  =   ∑    λ  i   U   (   g  i   )      .      T       subscript  λ  i   U   subscript  g  i       \displaystyle{T=\sum\lambda_{i}U(g_{i}).}     Moreover        Φ   (  1  )    =  P   .        normal-Φ  1   P    \displaystyle{\Phi(1)=P.}     Conversely, every operator-valued positive-definite function arises in this way. Recall that every (continuous) scalar-valued positive-definition function on a topological group is of the form φ( g ) = 〈 U g v , v 〉 where U g is a (strongly continuous) unitary representation (see Bochner's theorem ). Replacing v , a rank-1 projection, by a general projection gives the operator-valued statement. In fact the construction is identical; this is sketched below.  Let   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   be the space of functions on G of finite support with values in H with inner product        (   f  1   ,   f  2   )   =    ∑   g  ,  h     (   Φ   (    h   -  1    g   )    f  1    (  g  )    ,    f  2    (  h  )    )     .        subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2      subscript    g  h       normal-Φ     superscript  h    1    g    subscript  f  1   g      subscript  f  2   h       \displaystyle{(f_{1},f_{2})=\sum_{g,h}(\Phi(h^{-1}g)f_{1}(g),f_{2}(h)).}     G acts unitarily on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   by        U   (  g  )   f   (  x  )    =   f   (    g   -  1    x   )     .        U  g  f  x     f     superscript  g    1    x      \displaystyle{U(g)f(x)=f(g^{-1}x).}     Moreover H can be identified with a closed subspace of   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   using the isometric embedding sending v in H to f v with         f  v    (  g  )    =    δ   g  ,  1    v    .         subscript  f  v   g      subscript  δ   g  1    v     f_{v}(g)=\delta_{g,1}v.\,     If P is the projection of   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   onto H , then        P  U   (  g  )   P   =   Φ   (  g  )     ,        P  U  g  P     normal-Φ  g     \displaystyle{PU(g)P=\Phi(g),}     using the above identification.  When G is a separable topological group, Φ is continuous in the strong (or weak) operator topology if and only if U is.  In this case functions supported on a countable dense subgroup of G are dense in   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , so that   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   is separable.  When G = Z any contraction operator T defines such a function Φ through         Φ   (  0  )    =  I   ,     Φ   (  n  )    =   T  n    ,    Φ   (   -  n   )    =    (   T  *   )   n      ,     formulae-sequence      normal-Φ  0   I    formulae-sequence      normal-Φ  n    superscript  T  n        normal-Φ    n     superscript   superscript  T    n       \displaystyle\Phi(0)=I,\,\,\,\Phi(n)=T^{n},\,\,\,\Phi(-n)=(T^{*})^{n},     for n > 0. The above construction then yields a minimal unitary dilation.  The same method can be applied to prove a second dilation theorem of Sz._Nagy for a one-parameter strongly continuous contraction semigroup T ( t ) ( t ≥ 0) on a Hilbert space H .  had previously proved the result for one-parameter semigroups of isometries, 3  The theorem states that there is a larger Hilbert space K containing H and a unitary representation U ( t ) of R such that       T   (  t  )    =   P  U   (  t  )   P         T  t     P  U  t  P     \displaystyle{T(t)=PU(t)P}     and the translates U ( t ) H generate K .  In fact T ( t ) defines a continuous operator-valued positove-definite function Φ on R through         Φ   (  0  )    =  I   ,     Φ   (  t  )    =   T   (  t  )     ,    Φ   (   -  t   )    =   T    (  t  )   *       ,     formulae-sequence      normal-Φ  0   I    formulae-sequence      normal-Φ  t     T  t        normal-Φ    t      T   superscript  t         \displaystyle{\Phi(0)=I,\,\,\,\Phi(t)=T(t),\,\,\,\Phi(-t)=T(t)^{*},}     for t > 0. Φ is positive-definite on cyclic subgroups of R , by the argument for Z , and hence on R itself by continuity.  The previous construction yields a minimal unitary representation U ( t ) and projection P .  The Hille-Yosida theorem assigns a closed unbounded operator  A to every contractive one-parameter semigroup T '( t ) through        A  ξ   =    lim   t  ↓  0      1  t    (    T   (  t  )    -  I   )   ξ     ,        A  ξ     subscript    normal-↓  t  0        1  t       T  t   I   ξ      \displaystyle{A\xi=\lim_{t\downarrow 0}{1\over t}(T(t)-I)\xi,}     where the domain on A consists of all ξ for which this limit exists.  A is called the generator of the semigroup and satisfies       -   ℜ   (   A  ξ   ,  ξ  )     ≥  0            A  ξ   ξ    0    \displaystyle{-\Re(A\xi,\xi)\geq 0}     on its domain. When A is a self-adjoint operator        T   (  t  )    =   e   A  t     ,        T  t    superscript  e    A  t      \displaystyle{T(t)=e^{At},}     in the sense of the spectral theorem and this notation is used more generally in semigroup theory.  The cogenerator of the semigroup is the contraction defined by       T  =    (   A  +  I   )     (   A  -  I   )    -  1      .      T      A  I    superscript    A  I     1       \displaystyle{T=(A+I)(A-I)^{-1}.}     A can be recovered from T using the formula       A  =    (   T  +  I   )     (   T  -  I   )    -  1      .      A      T  I    superscript    T  I     1       \displaystyle{A=(T+I)(T-I)^{-1}.}     In particular a dilation of T on K ⊃ H immediately gives a dilation of the semigroup. 4  Functional calculus  Let T be totally non-unitary contraction on H . Then the minimal unitary dilation U of T on K ⊃ H is unitarily equivalent to a direct sum of copies the bilateral shift operator, i.e. multiplication by z on L 2 ( S 1 ). 5  If P is the orthogonal projection onto H then for f in L ∞ = L ∞ ( S 1 ) it follows that the operator f ( T ) can be defined by        f   (  T  )   ξ   =   P  f   (  U  )   ξ    .        f  T  ξ     P  f  U  ξ     \displaystyle{f(T)\xi=Pf(U)\xi.}     Let H ∞ be the space of bounded holomorphic functions on the unit disk D . Any such function has boundary values in L ∞ and is uniquely determined by these, so that there is an embedding H ∞ ⊂ L ∞ .  For f in H ∞ , f ( T ) can be defined without reference to the unitary dilation.  In fact if       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  ≥  0      a  n    z  n           f  z     subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n       \displaystyle{f(z)=\sum_{n\geq 0}a_{n}z^{n}}     for | z | \displaystyle{f_r(z))=\sum_{n\ge 0} r^n a_n z^n}  is holomorphic on | z | r ( T ) is defined by the holomorphic functional calculus and f ( T ) can be defined by        f   (  T  )   ξ   =    lim   r  →  1      f  r    (  T  )   ξ     .        f  T  ξ     subscript    normal-→  r  1       subscript  f  r   T  ξ      \displaystyle{f(T)\xi=\lim_{r\rightarrow 1}f_{r}(T)\xi.}     The map sending f to f ( T ) defines an algebra homomorphism of H ∞ into bounded operators on H . Moreover if         f  ∼    (  z  )    =    ∑   n  ≥  0      a  n     z  ¯   n      ,         superscript  f  similar-to   z     subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n    superscript   normal-¯  z   n       \displaystyle{f^{\sim}(z)=\sum_{n\geq 0}a_{n}\overline{z}^{n},}     then         f  ∼    (  T  )    =   f    (   T  *   )   *     .         superscript  f  similar-to   T     f   superscript   superscript  T         \displaystyle{f^{\sim}(T)=f(T^{*})^{*}.}     This map has the following continuity property: if a uniformly bounded sequence f n tends almost everywhere to f , then f n ( T ) tends to f ( T ) in the strong operator topology.  For t ≥ 0, let e t be the inner function         e  t    (  z  )    =   exp   t    z  +  1    z  -  1       .         subscript  e  t   z       t      z  1     z  1        \displaystyle{e_{t}(z)=\exp t{z+1\over z-1}.}     If T is the cogenerator of a one-parameter semigroup of completely non-unitary contractions T ( t ), then       T   (  t  )    =    e  t    (  T  )          T  t      subscript  e  t   T     \displaystyle{T(t)=e_{t}(T)}     and       T  =     1  2   I   -    1  2     ∫  0  ∞     e   -  t    T   (  t  )   d  t       .      T        1  2   I       1  2     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    t    T  t  d  t        \displaystyle{T={1\over 2}I-{1\over 2}\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}T(t)\,dt.}     C 0 contractions  A completely non-unitary contraction T is said to belong to the class C 0 if and only if f ( T ) = 0 for some non-zero f in H ∞ . In this case the set of such f forms an ideal in H ∞ . It has the form φ ⋅ H ∞ where g is an inner function , i.e. such that |φ| = 1 on S 1 : φ is uniquely determined up to multiplication by a complex number of modulus 1 and is called the minimal function of T . It has properties analogous to the minimal polynomial of a matrix.  The minimal function φ admits a canonical factorization        φ   (  z  )    =   c  B   (  z  )    e   -   P   (  z  )        ,        φ  z     c  B  z   superscript  e      P  z        \displaystyle{\varphi(z)=cB(z)e^{-P(z)},}     where | c |=1, B ( z ) is a Blaschke product        B   (  z  )    =   ∏    [     |   λ  i   |    λ  i       λ  i   -  z    1  -    λ  ¯   i      ]    m  i      ,        B  z    product   superscript   delimited-[]         subscript  λ  i     subscript  λ  i         subscript  λ  i   z     1   subscript   normal-¯  λ   i        subscript  m  i       \displaystyle{B(z)=\prod\left[{|\lambda_{i}|\over\lambda_{i}}{\lambda_{i}-z%
 \over 1-\overline{\lambda}_{i}}\right]^{m_{i}},}     with        ∑    m  i    (   1  -   |   λ  i   |    )     <  ∞   ,           subscript  m  i     1     subscript  λ  i          \displaystyle{\sum m_{i}(1-|\lambda_{i}|)<\infty,}     and P ( z ) is holomorphic with non-negative real part in D . By the Herglotz representation theorem ,       P   (  z  )    =    ∫  0   2  π        1  +    e   -   i  θ     z     1  -    e   -   i  θ     z      d  μ   (  θ  )           P  z     superscript   subscript   0     2  π          1     superscript  e      i  θ     z      1     superscript  e      i  θ     z     d  μ  θ      \displaystyle{P(z)=\int_{0}^{2\pi}{1+e^{-i\theta}z\over 1-e^{-i\theta}z}\,d\mu%
 (\theta)}     for some non-negative finite measure μ on the circle: in this case, if non-zero, μ must be singular with respect to Lebesgue measure. In the above decomposition of φ, either of the two factors can be absent.  The minimal function φ determines the spectrum of T . Within the unit disk, the spectral values are the zeros of φ. There are at most countably many such λ i , all eigenvalues of T , the zeros of B ( z ). A point of the unit circle does not lie in the spectrum of T if and only if φ has a holomorphic continuation to a neighbourhood of that point.  φ reduces to a Blaschke product exactly when H equals the closure of the direct sum (not necessarily orthogonal) of the generalized eigenspaces 6        H  i   =   {  ξ  :      (   T  -    λ  i   I    )    m  i    ξ   =  0   }    .       subscript  H  i    conditional-set  ξ       superscript    T     subscript  λ  i   I     subscript  m  i    ξ   0      \displaystyle{H_{i}=\{\xi:(T-\lambda_{i}I)^{m_{i}}\xi=0\}.}     Quasi-similarity  Two contractions T 1 and T 2 are said to be quasi-similar when there are bounded operators A , B with trivial kernel and dense range such that         A   T  1    =    T  2   A    ,    B   T  2    =    T  1   B     .     formulae-sequence      A   subscript  T  1       subscript  T  2   A        B   subscript  T  2       subscript  T  1   B      \displaystyle{AT_{1}=T_{2}A,\,\,\,BT_{2}=T_{1}B.}     The following properties of a contraction T are preserved under quasi-similarlity:   being unitary  being completely non-unitary  being in the class C 0  being multiplicity free , i.e. having a commutative commutant   Two quasi-similar C 0 contractions have the same minimal function and hence the same spectrum.  The classification theorem for C 0 contractions states that two multiplicity free C 0 contractions are quasi-similar if and only if they have the same minimal function (up to a scalar multiple). 7  A model for multiplicity free C 0 contractions with minimal function φ is given by taking       H  =    H  2   ⊖   φ   H  2      ,      H   symmetric-difference   superscript  H  2     φ   superscript  H  2       \displaystyle{H=H^{2}\ominus\varphi H^{2},}     where H 2 is the Hardy space of the circle and letting T be multiplication by z . 8  Such operators are called Jordan blocks and denoted S (φ).  As a generalization of Beurling's theorem , the commutant of such an operator consists exactly of operators ψ( T ) with ψ in H ≈ , i.e. multiplication operators on H 2 corresponding to functions in H ≈ .  A C 0 contraction operator T is multiplcity free if and only if it is quasi-similar to a Jordan block (necessarily corresponding the one corresponding to its minimal function).  Examples.   If a contraction T if quasi-similar to an operator S with        S   e  i    =    λ  i    e  i          S   subscript  e  i       subscript  λ  i    subscript  e  i      \displaystyle{Se_{i}=\lambda_{i}e_{i}}     with the λ i 's distinct, of modulus less than 1, such that       ∑   (   1  -   |   λ  i   |    )    <  1          1     subscript  λ  i      1    \displaystyle{\sum(1-|\lambda_{i}|)<1}     and ( e i ) is an orthonormal basis, then S , and hence T , is C 0 and multiplicity free. Hence H is the closure of direct sum of the λ i -eigenspaces of T , each having multiplicity one. This can also be seen directly using the definition of quasi-similarity.   The results above can be applied equally well to one-parameter semigroups, since, from the functional calculus, two semigroups are quasi-similar if and only if their cogenerators are quasi-similar. 9   Classification theorem for C 0 contractions:  Every C 0 contraction is canonically quasi-similar to a direct sum of Jordan blocks.  In fact every C 0 contraction is quasi-similar to a unique operator of the form      S  =    S   (   φ  1   )    ⊕   S   (    φ  1    φ  2    )    ⊕   S   (    φ  1    φ  2    φ  3    )    ⊕  ⋯       S   direct-sum    S   subscript  φ  1      S     subscript  φ  1    subscript  φ  2       S     subscript  φ  1    subscript  φ  2    subscript  φ  3     normal-⋯     \displaystyle{S=S(\varphi_{1})\oplus S(\varphi_{1}\varphi_{2})\oplus S(\varphi%
 _{1}\varphi_{2}\varphi_{3})\oplus\cdots}     where the φ n are uniquely determined inner functions, with φ 1 the minimal function of S and hence T . 10  See also   Kallman–Rota inequality  Stinespring dilation theorem  Hille-Yosida theorem for contraction semigroups   Notes  References          "  Category:Operator theory     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
