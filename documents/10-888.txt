   3-oxo-5beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenase      3-oxo-5beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 3-oxo-5beta-steroid 4-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a 3-oxo-5beta-steroid + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 3-oxo-Delta 4 -steroid + reduced acceptor   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-oxo-5beta-steroid and acceptor , whereas its two products are 3-oxo-Delta4-steroid and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific, those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxo-5beta-steroid:acceptor Delta4-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called 3-oxo-5beta-steroid:(acceptor) Delta4-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : bile acid biosynthesis , c21-steroid hormone metabolism , and androgen and estrogen metabolism .
