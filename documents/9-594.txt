   Differential graded category      Differential graded category   In mathematics , especially homological algebra , a differential graded category or DG category for short, is a category whose morphism sets are endowed with the additional structure of a differential graded Z -module.  In detail, this means that    H  o  m   (  A  ,  B  )       H  o  m   A  B     Hom(A,B)   , the morphisms from any object A to another object B of the category is a direct sum     ⊕   n  ∈  𝐙     H  o   m  n    (  A  ,  B  )        subscript  direct-sum    n  𝐙      H  o   subscript  m  n    A  B      \oplus_{n\in\mathbf{Z}}Hom_{n}(A,B)   and there is a differential d on this graded group, i.e. for all n a linear map    d  :    H  o   m  n    (  A  ,  B  )    →   H  o   m   n  +  1     (  A  ,  B  )        normal-:  d   normal-→    H  o   subscript  m  n    A  B      H  o   subscript  m    n  1     A  B       d:Hom_{n}(A,B)\rightarrow Hom_{n+1}(A,B)   , which has to satisfy     d  ∘  d   =  0        d  d   0    d\circ d=0   . This is equivalent to saying that    H  o  m   (  A  ,  B  )       H  o  m   A  B     Hom(A,B)   is a cochain complex . Furthermore, the composition of morphisms       H  o  m   (  A  ,  B  )    ⊗  H   o  m   (  B  ,  C  )    →   H  o  m   (  A  ,  C  )       normal-→     tensor-product    H  o  m   A  B    H   o  m   B  C      H  o  m   A  C      Hom(A,B)\otimes Hom(B,C)\rightarrow Hom(A,C)   is required to be a map of complexes, and for all objects A of the category, one requires     d   (   i   d  A    )    =  0        d    i   subscript  d  A     0    d(id_{A})=0   .

A little bit more sophisticated is the category of complexes    C   (  𝒜  )       C  𝒜    C(\mathcal{A})   over an additive category   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   . By definition,     Hom    C   (  𝒜  )    ,  n     (  A  ,  B  )        subscript  Hom     C  𝒜   n     A  B     \mathrm{Hom}_{C(\mathcal{A}),n}(A,B)   is the group of maps    A  →   B   [  n  ]       normal-→  A    B   delimited-[]  n      A\rightarrow B[n]   which do not need to respect the differentials of the complexes A and B , i.e.      Hom    C   (  𝒜  )    ,  n     (  A  ,  B  )    =    Π   l  ∈  𝐙    Hom   (   A  l   ,   B   l  +  n    )           subscript  Hom     C  𝒜   n     A  B       subscript  normal-Π    l  𝐙    Hom    subscript  A  l    subscript  B    l  n        \mathrm{Hom}_{C(\mathcal{A}),n}(A,B)=\Pi_{l\in\mathbf{Z}}\mathrm{Hom}(A_{l},B_%
 {l+n})   . The differential of such a morphism    f  =   (   f  l   :   A  l   →   B   l  +  n    )      fragments  f    fragments  normal-(   subscript  f  l   normal-:   subscript  A  l   normal-→   subscript  B    l  n    normal-)     f=(f_{l}:A_{l}\rightarrow B_{l+n})   of degree n is defined to be      f   l  +  1    ∘   d  A    +      (   -  1   )    n  +  1     d  B    ∘   f  l           subscript  f    l  1     subscript  d  A         superscript    1     n  1     subscript  d  B     subscript  f  l      f_{l+1}\circ d_{A}+(-1)^{n+1}d_{B}\circ f_{l}   , where     d  A   ,   d  B       subscript  d  A    subscript  d  B     d_{A},d_{B}   are the differentials of A and B , respectively. This applies to the category of complexes of quasi-coherent sheaves on a scheme over a ring.  A DG-category with one object is the same as a DG-ring. A DG-ring over a field is called DG-algebra, or differential graded algebra .   Further properties  The category of small dg-categories can be endowed with a model category structure such that weak equivalences are those functors that induce an equivalence of derived categories . 1  Given a dg-category C over some ring R , there is a notion of smoothness and properness of C that reduces to the usual notions of smooth and proper morphisms in case C is the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on some scheme X over R .
