   Draft:Kleiman's intersection theory      Draft:Kleiman's intersection theory   This is the intersection theory introduced by Snapper in 1959-60 and developed later by Cartier and Kleiman. The basic idea is to intersect cycles with Cartier divisors (in fact line bundles ), which results in technical simplification.  Basic definition  Let X be a scheme over a scheme S , Pic( X ) the Picard group of X and G the Grothendieck group of the category of coherent sheaves on X whose support is proper over an Artinian subscheme of S .  For each L in Pic( X ), define the endomorphism c 1 ( L ) of G (called the first Chern class of L ) by         c  1    (  L  )   F   =   F  -    L   -  1    ⊗  F     .         subscript  c  1   L  F     F   tensor-product   superscript  L    1    F      c_{1}(L)F=F-L^{-1}\otimes F.   It is additive on G since tensoring with a line bundle is exact. One also has:         c  1    (   L  1   )    c  1    (   L  2   )    =      c  1    (   L  1   )    +    c  1    (   L  2   )     -    c  1    (    L  1   ⊗   L  2    )            subscript  c  1    subscript  L  1    subscript  c  1    subscript  L  2           subscript  c  1    subscript  L  1       subscript  c  1    subscript  L  2        subscript  c  1    tensor-product   subscript  L  1    subscript  L  2        c_{1}(L_{1})c_{1}(L_{2})=c_{1}(L_{1})+c_{1}(L_{2})-c_{1}(L_{1}\otimes L_{2})   ; in particular,     c  1    (   L  1   )        subscript  c  1    subscript  L  1     c_{1}(L_{1})   and     c  1    (   L  2   )        subscript  c  1    subscript  L  2     c_{1}(L_{2})   commute.         c  1    (  L  )    c  1    (   L   -  1    )    =     c  1    (  L  )    +    c  1    (   L   -  1    )      .         subscript  c  1   L   subscript  c  1    superscript  L    1          subscript  c  1   L      subscript  c  1    superscript  L    1        c_{1}(L)c_{1}(L^{-1})=c_{1}(L)+c_{1}(L^{-1}).          dim    supp   c  1     (  L  )   F    ≤    dim   supp  F    -  1        dimension     supp   subscript  c  1    L  F       dimension   supp  F    1     \dim\operatorname{supp}c_{1}(L)F\leq\dim\operatorname{supp}F-1   (this is nontrivial and follows from a dévissage argument .)   The intersection number       L  1   ⋅  …  ⋅   L  r      normal-⋅   subscript  L  1   normal-…   subscript  L  r     L_{1}\cdot{\dots}\cdot L_{r}   of line bundles L i 's is then defined by:        L  1   ⋅  …  ⋅   L  r   ⋅  F   =   χ   (    c  1    (   L  1   )   ⋯   c  1    (   L  r   )   F   )         normal-⋅   subscript  L  1   normal-…   subscript  L  r   F     χ     subscript  c  1    subscript  L  1   normal-⋯   subscript  c  1    subscript  L  r   F      L_{1}\cdot{\dots}\cdot L_{r}\cdot F=\chi(c_{1}(L_{1})\cdots c_{1}(L_{r})F)   where χ denotes the Euler characteristic . Alternatively, one has by induction:         L  1   ⋅  …  ⋅   L  r   ⋅  F   =    ∑  0  r      (   -  1   )   i   χ   (    ∧  i     (    ⊕  0  r    L  j   -  1     )   ⊗  F    )      .       normal-⋅   subscript  L  1   normal-…   subscript  L  r   F     superscript   subscript   0   r      superscript    1   i   χ    superscript   i    tensor-product    superscript   subscript  direct-sum  0   r    superscript   subscript  L  j     1     F        L_{1}\cdot{\dots}\cdot L_{r}\cdot F=\sum_{0}^{r}(-1)^{i}\chi(\wedge^{i}(\oplus%
 _{0}^{r}L_{j}^{-1})\otimes F).   Each time F is fixed,     L  1   ⋅  …  ⋅   L  r   ⋅  F     normal-⋅   subscript  L  1   normal-…   subscript  L  r   F    L_{1}\cdot{\dots}\cdot L_{r}\cdot F   is a symmetric functional in L i 's.  If L i = O X ( D i ) for some Cartier divisors  D i 's, then we will write     D  1   ⋅  …  ⋅   D  r      normal-⋅   subscript  D  1   normal-…   subscript  D  r     D_{1}\cdot{\dots}\cdot D_{r}   for the intersection number.  Let    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be a morphism of S -schemes,      L  i   ,  1   ≤  i  ≤  m          subscript  L  i   1   i       m     L_{i},1\leq i\leq m   line bundles on X and F in G with    m  ≥   dim   supp  F        m   dimension   supp  F      m\geq\dim\operatorname{supp}F   . Then         f  *    L  1   ⋯   f  *    L  m    ⋅  F   =      L  1   ⋯   L  m    ⋅   f  *    F        normal-⋅     superscript  f     subscript  L  1   normal-⋯   superscript  f     subscript  L  m    F      normal-⋅     subscript  L  1   normal-⋯   subscript  L  m     subscript  f     F     f^{*}L_{1}\cdots f^{*}L_{m}\cdot F=L_{1}\cdots L_{m}\cdot f_{*}F   . 1  Cycles  TODO: copy the definition of A'_d from 2  Equivariant Chow ring  Let X be an equidimensional smooth scheme with the action of a linear algebraic group  G . We note:   A universal G -bundle EG on X admits an approximation by algebraic bundles of arbitrary large codimension. (Note    E  G      E  G    EG   is an ind-scheme .)  X can be covered by invariant quasi-projective open subsets.   (1. is always true and 2. holds by Sumihiro's theorem as X is normal.) Then one defines the equivariant Chow group to be        A  G  *    (  X  )    =   ⊕    A  n    (    E  G   (  n  )     ×  G   X   )            subscript   superscript  A    G   X    direct-sum     superscript  A  n     subscript   G     E  G  n   X       A^{*}_{G}(X)=\bigoplus A^{n}(EG(n)\times_{G}X)   where    E  G   (  n  )       E  G  n    EG(n)   is an invariant open subset with codimension at least n . (The definition is an analog of equivariant cohomology .) Like the usual Chow ring ,     A  G  *    (  X  )        subscript   superscript  A    G   X    A^{*}_{G}(X)   is a graded ring with respect to intersection product . Moreover, it is a graded algebra over     A  G  *    (   p  t   )        subscript   superscript  A    G     p  t     A^{*}_{G}(pt)   via the map induced by      X   ×  G   E   G   →    E  G   /  G      normal-→      subscript   G   X  E   G       E  G   G     X\times_{G}EG\to EG/G   .  There is the cycle map      cl  :     A  G  *    (  X  )    →    H  G    (  X  ;  ℤ  )        normal-:  cl   normal-→     subscript   superscript  A    G   X      subscript  H  G    X  ℤ       \operatorname{cl}:A^{*}_{G}(X)\to H_{G}(X;\mathbb{Z})   from the equivariant Chow ring to the equivariant cohomology ring . The map is an isomorphism if X admits a cell decomposition (e.g., X is a T -variety by the Białynicki-Birula decomposition .)
