Factor of automorphy

In mathematics, the notion of factor of automorphy arises for a group acting on a complex-analytic manifold. Suppose a group 
 
 
 
  acts on a complex-analytic manifold 
 
 
 
 . Then, 
 
 
 
  also acts on the space of holomorphic functions from 
 
 
 
  to the complex numbers. A function 
 
 
 
  is termed an automorphic form if the following holds:



where 
 
 
 
  is an everywhere nonzero holomorphic function. Equivalently, an automorphic form is a function whose divisor is invariant under the action of 
 
 
 
 .
The factor of automorphy for the automorphic form 
 
 
 
  is the function 
 
 
 
 . An automorphic function is an automorphic form for which 
 
 
 
  is the identity.
Some facts about factors of automorphy:

Every factor of automorphy is a cocycle for the action of 
 
 
 
  on the multiplicative group of everywhere nonzero holomorphic functions.
The factor of automorphy is a coboundary if and only if it arises from an everywhere nonzero automorphic form.
For a given factor of automorphy, the space of automorphic forms is a vector space.
The pointwise product of two automorphic forms is an automorphic form corresponding to the product of the corresponding factors of automorphy.

Relation between factors of automorphy and other notions:

Let 
 
 
 
  be a lattice in a Lie group 
 
 
 
 . Then, a factor of automorphy for 
 
 
 
  corresponds to a line bundle on the quotient group 
 
 
 
 . Further, the automorphic forms for a given factor of automorphy correspond to sections of the corresponding line bundle.

The specific case of 
 
 
 
  a subgroup of SL(2,Â R), acting on the upper half-plane, is treated in the article on automorphic factors.
