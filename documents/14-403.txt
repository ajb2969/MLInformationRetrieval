Periodic summation

In signal processing, any periodic function  
 
 
 
   with period T can be represented by a summation of an infinite number of instances of an aperiodic function,  
 
 
 
  , that are offset by integer multiples of T.  This representation is called periodic summation:



When  
 
 
 
   is alternatively represented as a complex Fourier series, the Fourier coefficients are proportional to the values (or "samples") of the continuous Fourier transform of  
 
 
 
   at intervals of  
 
 
12  That identity is a form of the Poisson summation formula. Similarly, a Fourier series whose coefficients are samples of function  
 
 
 
   is equivalent to a periodic summation of the Fourier transform of  
 
 
 
 ,  which is known as a discrete-time Fourier transform.
Periodization of a function
In mathematics, the periodization of a function or generalized function is the operation 
 
 
 
  that assigns the (generalized) function 
 
 
 
  defined by



to a (generalized) function 
 
 
 
  that is of compact support or at least rapidly decreasing to zero as 
 
 
 
  tends to infinity, where 
 
 
 
  is a positive, real number determining the period of 
 
 
 
 . The periodic function 
 
 
 
  is also called periodization of 
 
 
 
 , periodic function of 
 
 
 
  or periodic continuation of function 
 
 
 
  with period 
 
 
 
 . Periodization is an operation that is closely related to discretization via the Discretization-Periodization theorem. Example: Periodizing the Dirac delta yields the Dirac comb.
Quotient space as domain
If a periodic function is represented using the quotient space domain

 
  then one can write






instead. The arguments of 
 
 
 
  are equivalence classes of real numbers that share the same fractional part when divided by 
 
 
 
 .
