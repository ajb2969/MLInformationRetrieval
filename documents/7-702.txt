   Stanton number      Stanton number   The Stanton number , St , is a dimensionless number that measures the ratio of heat transferred into a fluid to the thermal capacity of fluid. The Stanton number is named after Thomas Edward Stanton (1865–1931). 1 It is used to characterize heat transfer in forced convection flows.      St  =   h   G   c  p     =   h   ρ  u   c  p           St    h    G   subscript  c  p            h    ρ  u   subscript  c  p        \mathrm{St}=\frac{h}{Gc_{p}}=\frac{h}{\rho uc_{p}}     where   h = convection  heat transfer coefficient  ρ = density of the fluid  c p = specific heat of the fluid  u = speed of the fluid   It can also be represented in terms of the fluid's Nusselt , Reynolds , and Prandtl numbers:      St  =   Nu    Re   Pr        St    Nu    Re  Pr      \mathrm{St}=\frac{\mathrm{Nu}}{\mathrm{Re}\,\mathrm{Pr}}     where   Nu is the Nusselt number ;  Re is the Reynolds number ;  Pr is the Prandtl number . 2   The Stanton number arises in the consideration of the geometric similarity of the momentum boundary layer and the thermal boundary layer, where it can be used to express a relationship between the shear force at the wall (due to viscous drag ) and the total heat transfer at the wall (due to thermal diffusivity ).
