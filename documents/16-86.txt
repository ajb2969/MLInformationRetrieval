   (+)-gamma-cadinene synthase      (+)-gamma-cadinene synthase   (+)-gamma-cadinene synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((+)-gamma-cadinene-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+)-gamma-cadinene + diphosphate    The enzyme from the melon , Cucumis melo , forms mainly delta- and gamma-cadinene.
