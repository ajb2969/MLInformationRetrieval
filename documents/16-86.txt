(+)-gamma-cadinene synthase

(+)-gamma-cadinene synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((+)-gamma-cadinene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-gamma-cadinene + diphosphate


The enzyme from the melon, Cucumis melo, forms mainly delta- and gamma-cadinene.
