Basic solution (linear programming)

In linear programming, a discipline within applied mathematics, a basic solution''' is any solution of a linear programming problem satisfying certain specified technical conditions.
For a polyhedron

 
  and a vector 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a basic solution if:

All the equality constraints defining 
 
 
 
  are active at 
 
 

Of all the constraints that are active at that vector, at least 
 
 
 
  of them must be linearly independent. Note that this also means that at least 
 
 
 
  constraints must be active at that vector.1

A constraint is active for a particular solution 
 
 
 
  if it is satisfied at equality for that solution.
A basic solution that satisfies all the constraints defining 
 
 
 
  or in other words, one that lies within 
 
 
 
  is called a basic feasible solution.
