   Basic solution (linear programming)      Basic solution (linear programming)   In linear programming , a discipline within applied mathematics , a basic solution''' is any solution of a linear programming problem satisfying certain specified technical conditions.  For a polyhedron    P   P   P   and a vector     𝐱  *   ∈   ℛ  n        superscript  𝐱     superscript  ℛ  n     \mathbf{x}^{*}\in\mathcal{R}^{n}   ,    𝐱  *     superscript  𝐱     \mathbf{x}^{*}   is a basic solution if:   All the equality constraints defining   P   P   P   are active at    𝐱  *     superscript  𝐱     \mathbf{x}^{*}     Of all the constraints that are active at that vector, at least   n   n   n   of them must be linearly independent . Note that this also means that at least   n   n   n   constraints must be active at that vector. 1   A constraint is active for a particular solution   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   if it is satisfied at equality for that solution.  A basic solution that satisfies all the constraints defining   P   P   P   or in other words, one that lies within   P   P   P   is called a basic feasible solution .
