   Zsigmondy's theorem      Zsigmondy's theorem   In number theory , Zsigmondy's theorem , named after Karl Zsigmondy , states that if  are coprime  integers , then for any integer  n ‚â• 1, there is a prime number  p (called a primitive prime divisor ) that divides and does not divide for any positive integer , with the following exceptions:    , and ;     , , and ; or     is a power of two , and .   This generalizes Bang's theorem, which states that if  and n is not equal to 6, then has a prime divisor not dividing any with .  Similarly, has at least one primitive prime divisor with the exception .  Zsigmondy's theorem is often useful, especially in group theory, where it is used to prove that various groups have distinct orders except when they are known to be the same.  History  The theorem was discovered by Zsigmondy working in Vienna from 1894 until 1925.  Generalizations  Let     (   a  n   )    n  ‚â•  1      subscript   subscript  a  n     n  1     (a_{n})_{n\geq 1}   be a sequence of nonzero integers. The Zsigmondy set associated to the sequence is the set        ùíµ   (   a  n   )    =   {   n  ‚â•  1   :    a  n   has no primitive prime divisors   }    .        ùíµ   subscript  a  n     conditional-set    n  1      subscript  a  n   has no primitive prime divisors      \mathcal{Z}(a_{n})=\{n\geq 1:a_{n}\text{ has no primitive prime divisors}\}.     i.e., the set of indices   n   n   n   such that every prime dividing    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   also divides some    a  m     subscript  a  m    a_{m}   for some    m  <  n      m  n    m   . Thus Zsigmondy's theorem implies that     ùíµ   (    a  n   -   b  n    )    ‚äÇ   {  1  ,  2  ,  6  }         ùíµ     superscript  a  n    superscript  b  n      1  2  6     \mathcal{Z}(a^{n}-b^{n})\subset\{1,2,6\}   , and Carmichael's theorem says that the Zsigmondy set of the Fibonacci sequence is    {  1  ,  2  ,  6  ,  12  }     1  2  6  12    \{1,2,6,12\}   , and that of the Pell sequence is    {  1  }     1    \{1\}   . In 2001 Bilu, Hanrot, and Voutier 1 proved that in general, if     (   a  n   )    n  ‚â•  1      subscript   subscript  a  n     n  1     (a_{n})_{n\geq 1}   is a Lucas sequence or a Lehmer sequence , then    ùíµ   (   a  n   )   ‚äÜ   {  1  ‚â§  n  ‚â§  30  }      fragments  Z   fragments  normal-(   subscript  a  n   normal-)     fragments  normal-{  1   n   30  normal-}     \mathcal{Z}(a_{n})\subseteq\{1\leq n\leq 30\}   . Lucas and Lehmer sequences are examples of divisibility sequences .  It is also known that if     (   W  n   )    n  ‚â•  1      subscript   subscript  W  n     n  1     (W_{n})_{n\geq 1}   is an elliptic divisibility sequence , then its Zsigmondy set    ùíµ   (   W  n   )       ùíµ   subscript  W  n     \mathcal{Z}(W_{n})   is finite. 2 However, the result is ineffective in the sense that the proof does give an explicit upper bound for the largest element in    ùíµ   (   W  n   )       ùíµ   subscript  W  n     \mathcal{Z}(W_{n})   , although it is possible to give an effective upper bound for the number of elements in    ùíµ   (   W  n   )       ùíµ   subscript  W  n     \mathcal{Z}(W_{n})   . 3  See also   Carmichael's theorem   References         External links     "  Category:Theorems in number theory     Y.
