Lombricine kinase

In enzymology, a lombricine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + lombricine 
 
 
 
  ADP + N-phospholombricine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and lombricine, whereas its two products are ADP and N-phospholombricine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a nitrogenous group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:lombricine N-phosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism.
