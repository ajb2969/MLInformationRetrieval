   Hilbert number      Hilbert number   |Gelfond–Schneider constant}} In number theory, a Hilbert number is defined as a positive integer of the form 4 n + 1 (). The Hilbert numbers were named after David Hilbert .  The integer sequence of Hilbert numbers is 1, 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, 49, … . A Hilbert prime is a Hilbert number that is not divisible by a smaller Hilbert number (other than 1). The sequence of Hilbert primes is 5, 9, 13, 17, 21, 29, 33, 37, 41, 49, ... (). Note that Hilbert primes do not have to be prime numbers ; for example, 21 is a composite Hilbert prime. It follows from multiplication modulo 4 that a Hilbert prime is either a prime number of form 4 n + 1 (called a Pythagorean prime ), or a semiprime of form (4 a + 3) × (4 b + 3).
