   Glutamate N-acetyltransferase      Glutamate N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a glutamate N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 2 -acetyl-L-ornithine + L-glutamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-ornithine + N-acetyl-L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N2-acetyl-L-ornithine and L-glutamate , whereas its two products are L-ornithine and N-acetyl-L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N2-acetyl-L-ornithine:L-glutamate N-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include ornithine transacetylase , alpha-N-acetyl-L-ornithine:L-glutamate N-acetyltransferase , acetylglutamate synthetase , acetylglutamate-acetylornithine transacetylase , acetylglutamic synthetase , acetylglutamic-acetylornithine transacetylase , acetylornithinase , acetylornithine glutamate acetyltransferase , glutamate acetyltransferase , N-acetyl-L-glutamate synthetase , N-acetylglutamate synthase , N-acetylglutamate synthetase , ornithine acetyltransferase , and 2-N-acetyl-L-ornithine:L-glutamate N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
