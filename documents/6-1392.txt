   Q value (nuclear science)      Q value (nuclear science)   In nuclear physics and chemistry , the Q value for a reaction is the amount of energy released by that reaction. The value relates to the enthalpy of a chemical reaction or the energy of radioactive decay products. It can be determined from the masses of reactants and products. Q values affect reaction rates.  Definition  Considering the energy conservation of the simple reaction, enables the general definition of Q based on mass-energy equivalence , where K is kinetic energy and m is mass:      Q  =    K   (  Final  )    -   K   (  Initial  )     =    (    m   I  n  i  t  i  a  l    -   m   F  i  n  a  l     )    c  2          Q     subscript  K  Final    subscript  K  Initial              subscript  m    I  n  i  t  i  a  l     subscript  m    F  i  n  a  l      superscript  c  2       Q=K_{(\text{Final})}-K_{(\text{Initial})}=(m_{Initial}-m_{Final})c^{2}     A reaction with a positive Q value is exothermic , i.e. has a net release of energy, since the kinetic energy of the final state is greater than the kinetic energy of the initial state. A reaction with a negative Q value is endothermic , i.e. requires a net energy input, since the kinetic energy of the final state is less than the kinetic energy of the initial state. 1  Applications  Chemical Q values are measurement in calorimetry. Exothermic chemical reactions tend to be more spontaneous and can emit light or heat, resulting in runaway feedback(i.e. explosions).  Q values are also featured in particle physics . For example, Sargent's rule states that weak reaction rates are proportional to Q 5 . The Q value is the kinetic energy released in the decay at rest. For neutron decay, some mass disappears as neutrons convert to a proton, electron and antineutrino: 2      Q  =    (    m  n   -   m  p   -   m   ν  ¯    -   m  e    )    c  2    =    K  p   +   K  e   +   K   ν  ¯     =   0.782  M  e  V         Q       subscript  m  n    subscript  m  p    subscript  m   normal-¯  ν     subscript  m  e     superscript  c  2            subscript  K  p    subscript  K  e    subscript  K   normal-¯  ν            0.782  M  e  V      Q=(m_{\text{n}}-m_{\text{p}}-m_{\mathrm{\overline{\nu}}}-m_{\text{e}})c^{2}=K_%
 {p}+K_{e}+K_{\overline{\nu}}=0.782MeV     where m n is the mass of the neutron , m p is the mass of the proton , m     ν  ¯     normal-¯  ν    \overline{ν}    is the mass of the electron antineutrino and m e is the mass of the electron ; and the K are the corresponding kinetic energies. The neutron has no initial kinetic energy since it is at rest. In beta decay, a typical Q is around 1 MeV.  The decay energy is divided among the products in a continuous distribution for more than 2 products. Measuring this spectrum allows one to find the mass of a product. Experiments are studying emission spectrums to search for neutrinoless decay and neutrino mass; this is the principle of the upcoming KATRIN experiment.
