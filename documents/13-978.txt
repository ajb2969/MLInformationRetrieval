   Rossmo's formula      Rossmo's formula   Rossmo's formula is a geographic profiling formula to predict where a serial criminal lives. The formula was developed and patented 1 by criminologist  Kim Rossmo and integrated into a specialized crime analysis software product called Rigel . The Rigel product is developed by the software company Environmental Criminology Research Inc. (ECRI), which Rossmo co-founded. 2  Formula  Imagine a map with an overlaying grid of little squares named sectors. If this map is a raster image file on a computer, these sectors are pixels. A sector    S   i  ,  j      subscript  S   i  j     S_{i,j}   is the square on row i and column j , located at coordinates ( X i , Y j ). The following function gives the probability    p   i  ,  j      subscript  p   i  j     p_{i,j}   of the position of the serial criminal residing within a specific sector (or point)    (   X  i   ,   Y  j   )      subscript  X  i    subscript  Y  j     (X_{i},Y_{j})   : 3        p   i  ,  j    =   k    ∑   n  =  1    (    total   crimes   )     [       ϕ   i  j      (    |    X  i   -   x  n    |   +   |    Y  j   -   y  n    |    )   f    ⏟      1  st    term    +       (   1  -   ϕ   i  j     )    (   B   g  -  f    )      (    2  B   -   ∣    X  i   -   x  n    ∣   -   ∣    Y  j   -   y  n    ∣    )   g    ⏟      2  nd    term     ]      ,       subscript  p   i  j      k    superscript   subscript     n  1      total  crimes     delimited-[]     subscript   normal-⏟     subscript  ϕ    i  j     superscript         subscript  X  i    subscript  x  n          subscript  Y  j    subscript  y  n      f        superscript  1  st   term     subscript   normal-⏟        1   subscript  ϕ    i  j      superscript  B    g  f      superscript      2  B    delimited-∣∣     subscript  X  i    subscript  x  n      delimited-∣∣     subscript  Y  j    subscript  y  n      g        superscript  2  nd   term          p_{i,j}=k\sum_{n=1}^{(\mathrm{total\;crimes})}\left[\par

 \right],   where:     ϕ   i  j    =   {      1  ,        if    (    ∣    X  i   -   x  n    ∣   +   ∣    Y  j   -   y  n    ∣    )    >  B        0  ,      else            subscript  ϕ    i  j     cases  1      if     delimited-∣∣     subscript  X  i    subscript  x  n      delimited-∣∣     subscript  Y  j    subscript  y  n       B   0  else     \phi_{ij}=\begin{cases}1,&\mathrm{\quad if\;}(\mid X_{i}-x_{n}\mid+\mid Y_{j}-%

If a crime occurs within the buffer zone, then     ϕ   i  j    =  0       subscript  ϕ    i  j    0    \phi_{ij}=0   and, thus, the first term does not contribute to the overall result. This is a prerogative for defining the first term in the case when the distance between a point (or pixel) becomes equal to zero. When     ϕ   i  j    =  1       subscript  ϕ    i  j    1    \phi_{ij}=1   , the 1st term is used to calculate    p   i  ,  j      subscript  p   i  j     p_{i,j}   .       ∣    X  i   -   x  n    ∣   +   ∣    Y  j   -   y  n    ∣        delimited-∣∣     subscript  X  i    subscript  x  n      delimited-∣∣     subscript  Y  j    subscript  y  n       \mid X_{i}-x_{n}\mid+\mid Y_{j}-y_{n}\mid   is the Manhattan distance between a point    (   X  i   ,   Y  j   )      subscript  X  i    subscript  Y  j     (X_{i},Y_{j})   and the n -th crime site    (   x  n   ,   y  n   )      subscript  x  n    subscript  y  n     (x_{n},y_{n})   .  Explanation  The summation in the formula consists of two terms. The first term describes the idea of decreasing probability with increasing distance . The second term deals with the concept of a buffer zone . The variable   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is used to put more weight on one of the two ideas. The variable   B   B   B   describes the radius of the buffer zone. The constant   k   k   k   is empirically determined.  The main idea of the formula is that the probability of crimes first increases as one moves through the buffer zone away from the hotzone , but decreases afterwards. The variable   f   f   f   can be chosen so that it works best on data of past crimes. The same idea goes for the variable   g   g   g   .  The distance is calculated with the Manhattan distance formula .  Applications  The formula has been applied to fields other than forensics.  4  Because of the buffer zone idea, the formula works well for studies concerning predatory animals such as white sharks.  5  This formula and math behind it were used in crime detecting in the Pilot episode of the TV-series Numb3rs and in the 100th episode of the same show, called " Disturbed ".
