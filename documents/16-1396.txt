   Draft:Hidden Variables (Network Science)      Draft:Hidden Variables (Network Science)    Hidden variables in network science refer to latent properties of nodes in a network which are used to understand how local physical properties of a system affect the global connectivity and topological structure. Specifically, this concept could refer to similar interests underlying friendships, energies associated with metabolic reactions, isometries of protein-protein interactions, or spatial distances between internet data centers. Notably, the Barabási-Albert model of preferential attachment has proven to be successful in demonstrating how a dynamic network can become scale-free (as we see in many real networks), but this requires new nodes to have global knowledge of the existing network. More often than not, new nodes connect to a given part of the network for other more practical reasons, such as low spatial distance, low monetary cost, and so forth. The fitness model proposed by Bianconi and Barabási was the first step in this direction, but it remained firmly rooted in the preferential attachment philosophy. For this reason, others have studied and developed the theory of hidden variables in network science in an attempt to better characterize real network evolution.  The Origin of the Concept  In the seminal work by Goh et. al. the hidden variable concept was formalized in terms of the load (or betweenness centrality ) of a vertex in the network [5]. In an information network such as the Internet, this quantity describes how many packets travel through a given router when traveling between two other randomly selected points in the network. Real networks typically have a power law degree distribution in the form  $$P\left(k\right)\sim k^{-\gamma}$$  where $\gamma$ is the critical exponent . When this exponent is in the range $2<\gamma\leq3$ the network becomes scale-free, as is the case in most real networks. In terms of hidden variables, Goh et. al. assign weights $p_i = i^{-\alpha}$ to each node, where $\alpha\in[0,1)$ . When nodes are linked with probabilities proportional to the hidden variable of each of the two chosen nodes, the resulting network has a critical exponent given by  $$\gamma = \frac{1+\alpha}{\alpha}$$  Further, once this scale-free network is constructed it can be shown that the load follows a power-law which has a critical exponent independent of the hidden variables. This universal behavior is significant for understanding the details of network percolation in various real networks. This can be generalized to other types of networks, such as social networks , where organizations may wish to know how beliefs propagate through platforms such as Facebook or Twitter.  In a subsequent work by Caldarelli et. al. the hidden variables were expressed in terms of the fitness associated with nodes, a throwback to previous work by Bianconi and Barabási [3]. However, the emphasis was still placed on the nodes themselves rather than on the preferential attachment mechanism. Somewhat counterintuitively, they showed in simulation that "even non-scale-free fitness distributions can generate scale-free networks" . In this particular model they had been studying threshold phenomena in which the connection probability was a Heaviside step function and the fitness distribution was a Poisson distribution. This group concluded that this threshold phenomenon modelled well protein-protein interactions in RNA transcription, and in turn paved the way for a broader study of hidden variables in other complex networks.  From Local Properties to Global Observables  Review of Useful Network Properties  Hidden variable theories in complex networks have been further developed in the context of undirected Markovian random networks . The global properties of these networks can be fully defined by the joint distribution , given by  $$P\left(k,k^\prime\right) = \frac{E_{kk^\prime}}{\langle k\rangle N}$$  where $E_{kk^\prime}$ is the symmetric edge matrix describing the number of edges between two vertices of degree $k$ and $k^\prime,$ the quantity $\langle k\rangle$ is the average degree of the network, and $N$ is the total number of nodes in the network. From this quantity, the degree distribution can be written as  $$P\left(k\right) = \frac{\langle k\rangle}{k}\sum\limits_{k^\prime}P\left(k,k^\prime\right)$$  and the average nearest neighbor degree (ANND) can be written in terms of the conditional probability $P\left(k^\prime|k\right)$  $$\bar{k}_{nn}\left(k\right) = \sum\limits_{k^\prime}k^\prime P\left(k^\prime|k\right)$$  where here the conditional probability is defined in terms of the edge matrix as  $$P\left(k^\prime|k\right) = \frac{E_{k^\prime k}}{kN_k}$$  The average nearest neighbor degree is a useful statistical means of describing correlations between pairs nodes of the same degrees in a network. When nodes tend to connect to other nodes of the same degree, it is called assortative mixing and in the opposite case it is called disassortitave mixing .  Further, the clustering of a network is a useful tool for describing correlations between triplets of nodes in a network. The average clustering as a function of degree can be written as  $$\bar{c}\left(k\right) = \sum\limits_{k^\prime,k^{\prime\prime}}P\left(k^\prime|k\right)P\left(k^{\prime\prime}|k\right)p_{k^\prime,k^{\prime\prime}}$$  where the final term in the expression, $p_{k^\prime,k^{\prime\prime}}$ , describes the connection probability between two nodes of degree $k^\prime$ and $k^{\prime\prime}$ .  The Hidden Variable Formulation  To construct a network using the most basic hidden variable approach, nodes are first assigned a hidden variable $h_i$ from a distribution $\rho(h)$ . Then, every pair of nodes is linked with a probability described by a distribution $r(h_i,h_j)$ which is a function of the hidden variables of each node. This connection probability distribution is symmetric for undirected networks but the approach may be generalized to directed networks as well. The degree distribution can be written in terms of the hidden variable distribution as  $$P(k) = \sum\limits_{h}g(k|h)\rho(h)$$  where the propagator $g(k|h)$ describes the probability that a node with hidden variable $h$ will obtain $k$ edges. The average degree is then simply the first moment of these distributions:  $$\bar{k}(h) = \sum\limits_{k}kg(k|h)$$  $$\langle k\rangle = \sum\limits_{h}\bar{k}(h)\rho(h)$$  Returning to the original connection probability, these expressions can be written as  $$\bar{k}(h) = N\sum\limits_{h^\prime}\rho(h^\prime)r(h,h^\prime)$$  $$\langle k\rangle = N\sum\limits_{h,h^\prime}\rho(h)r(h,h^\prime)\rho(h^\prime)$$  As described in the previous section, the ANND may also be formulated in terms of hidden variables in order to describe the assortativity resulting from the hidden variable distribution and connection probability distribution:  $$\bar{k}_{nn}(h) = \sum\limits_{h^\prime} = \bar{k}(h^\prime)p(h^\prime|h)$$  where the normalized connection probability between nodes with hidden variables $h$ and $h^\prime$ is defined as  $$p(h^\prime|h) = \frac{\rho(h^\prime)r(h,h^\prime)}{\sum\limits_{h^{\prime\prime}}\rho(h^{\prime\prime})r(h,h^{\prime\prime})} = \frac{N\rho(h^\prime)r(h,h^\prime)}{\bar{k}(h)}$$  Finally, the clustering coefficients can be described in terms of the hidden variables as well:  $$c_h = \sum\limits_{h^\prime,h^{\prime\prime}}p(h^\prime|h)r(h^\prime,h^{\prime\prime})p(h^{\prime\prime}|h)$$  $$\bar{c}(k) = \frac{1}{P(k)}\sum\limits_h \rho(h)g(k|h)c_h$$  These expressions can be used to describe most of the relevant statistical quantities in the hidden variable approach from a theoretical standpoint.  Applications of Hidden Variables  (Figure)  The internet at the AS level can be embedded in a hyperbolic manifold using the hidden variables approach.   The Configuration Model  To a certain extent, the configuration model is a type of hidden variable model even though it was formulated quite a while before the notion of hidden variables originated [4]. In this model, the network is created by specifying the degrees of each node a priori . Nodes obtain "stubs" which can be viewed as unconnected edges, and then stubs of different nodes are connected at random until all stubs have been used. Of course, it is highly likely that there will be leftover stubs unless the graph has certain properties (e.g. it is a k-regular graph ), but if the number of nodes is large enough these last few stubs can be connected to any random node without biasing the degree distribution or average degree. In the end, the configuration model is more of a theoretical framework than anything else, and so it is of limited use for the study of real networks.  Geometric Approach to Complex Networks  Perhaps one of the most successful approaches to the study of hidden variables in complex networks involves the study of underlying topologies . In this case, the hidden variables are the spatial coordinates of the nodes, and links are determined by an underlying metric [1,6,7,8]. The most widely studied is the hyperbolic geometry , in which nodes are embedded in $\mathbb{H}^2$ . The radial coordinate corresponds to the degree of the node, so that the hubs are near the origin, and the angular coordinate reflects a similarity variable, such as geospatial position for the Internet. This hidden variable approach has provided a new way of studying navigability in these networks using geometric techniques.
