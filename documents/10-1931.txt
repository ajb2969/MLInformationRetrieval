   4-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase      4-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetate + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-methylphenol + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-hydroxyphenylacetate and H + , whereas its two products are 4-methylphenol and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-(hydroxyphenyl)acetate carboxy-lyase (4-methylphenol-forming) . Other names in common use include p-hydroxyphenylacetate decarboxylase , p-Hpd , 4-Hpd , and 4-hydroxyphenylacetate carboxy-lyase .
