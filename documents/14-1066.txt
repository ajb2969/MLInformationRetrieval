 ×2, [[3[7]]] |- |Properties||vertex-transitive |} In six-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the 6-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 6-simplex, rectified 6-simplex, and birectified 6-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 1:1:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.
A6 lattice
This vertex arrangement is called the A6 lattice or 6-simplex lattice. The 42 vertices of the expanded 6-simplex vertex figure represent the 42 roots of the 
 
 
Coxeter group.1 It is the 6-dimensional case of a simplectic honeycomb. Around each vertex figure are 126 facets: 7+7 6-simplex, 21+21 rectified 6-simplex, 35+35 birectified 6-simplex, with the count distribution from the 8th row of Pascal's triangle.
The A
 
 
 
  lattice (also called A
 
 
 
 ) is the union of seven A6 lattices, and has the vertex arrangement of the dual to the omnitruncated 6-simplex honeycomb, and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is the omnitruncated 6-simplex.

Projection by folding
The 6-simplex honeycomb can be projected into the 3-dimensional cubic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement:
