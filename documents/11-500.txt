   Guanosine-3',5'-bis(diphosphate) 3'-diphosphatase      Guanosine-3',5'-bis(diphosphate) 3'-diphosphatase   In enzymology , a guanosine-3',5'-bis(diphosphate) 3'-diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   guanosine 3',5'-bis(diphosphate) + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   guanosine 5'-diphosphate + diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are guanosine 3',5'-bis(diphosphate) and H 2 O , whereas its two products are guanosine 5'-diphosphate and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on diphosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is guanosine-3',5'-bis(diphosphate) 3'-diphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include guanosine-3',5'-bis(diphosphate) 3'-pyrophosphatase , PpGpp-3'-pyrophosphohydrolase , and PpGpp phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
