   Dwell time (radar)      Dwell time (radar)   Dwell time ( T D ) in surveillance radar is the time that an antenna beam spends on a target. 1 The dwell time of a 2D–search radar depends predominantly on   the antennas horizontally beam width θ AZ , and  the turn speed n of the antenna (in rotations per minute or rpm, i.e. 360 degrees in 60 seconds = multiplied by a factor of 6).   Dwell time is calculatd by:       T  D   =    θ   A  Z     6  ⋅  n         subscript  T  D      subscript  θ    A  Z     normal-⋅  6  n      T_{D}=\frac{\theta_{AZ}}{6\cdot n}    [in seconds]  References    "  Category:Radar     ↩
