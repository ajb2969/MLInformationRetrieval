   Freedman–Diaconis rule      Freedman–Diaconis rule   In statistics , the Freedman–Diaconis rule , named after David A. Freedman and Persi Diaconis , can be used to select the size of the bins to be used in a histogram . 1 The general equation for the rule is:      Bin size  =    2   IQR   (  x  )     n   -   1  /  3           Bin size    2  IQR  x   superscript  n      1  3        \text{Bin size}=2\,\text{IQR}(x)n^{-1/3}\;     where    IQR   (  x  )      IQR  x    \scriptstyle\operatorname{IQR}(x)\;   is the interquartile range of the data and    n    n   \scriptstyle n\;   is the number of observations in the sample    x  .    x   \scriptstyle x.\;     Other approaches  Another approach is to use Sturges' rule : use a bin so large that there are about    1  +    log  2   n       1    subscript   2   n     \scriptstyle 1+\log_{2}n   non-empty bins (Scott, 2009). 2 This works well for n under 200, but was found to be inaccurate for large n . 3 For a discussion and an alternative approach, see Birgé and Rozenholc. 4  References  "  Category:Rules of thumb  Category:Statistical charts and diagrams  Category:Infographics     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
