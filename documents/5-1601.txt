Freedman–Diaconis rule

In statistics, the Freedman–Diaconis rule, named after David A. Freedman and Persi Diaconis, can be used to select the size of the bins to be used in a histogram.1 The general equation for the rule is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the interquartile range of the data and 
 
 
 
  is the number of observations in the sample 
 
 

Other approaches
Another approach is to use Sturges' rule: use a bin so large that there are about 
 
 
 
  non-empty bins (Scott, 2009).2 This works well for n under 200, but was found to be inaccurate for large n.3 For a discussion and an alternative approach, see Birgé and Rozenholc.4
