Rainbow coloring

 In graph theory, a path in an edge-colored graph is said to be rainbow if no color repeats on it. A graph is said to be rainbow colored if there is a rainbow path between each pair of its vertices. If there is a rainbow shortest path between each pair of vertices, the graph is said to be strong rainbow colored.
Definitions and bounds
The rainbow connection number of a graph 
 
 
 
  is the minimum number of colors needed to rainbow color 
 
 
 
 , and is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . Similarly, the strong rainbow connection number of a graph 
 
 
 
  is the minimum number of colors needed to strong rainbow color 
 
 
 
 , and is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . Clearly, each strong rainbow coloring is also a rainbow coloring, while the converse is not true in general.
It is easy to observe that to rainbow color any connected graph 
 
 
 
 , we need at least 
 
 
 
  colors, where 
 
 
 
  is the diameter of 
 
 
 
  (i.e. the length of the longest shortest path). On the other hand, we can never use more than 
 
 
 
  colors, where 
 
 
 
  denotes the number of edges in 
 
 
 
 . Finally, because each strong rainbow colored graph is rainbow colored, we have that 
 
 
 
 .
The following are the extremal cases:



 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a complete graph.


 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a tree.

Exact rainbow or strong rainbow connection numbers
The rainbow or the strong rainbow connection number has been determined for some structured graph classes:



 
 , for each integer 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the cycle graph.




 
 , for each integer 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the wheel graph.

Complexity
The problem of deciding whether 
 
 
 
  for a given graph 
 
 
 
  is NP-complete. Because 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 , it follows that deciding if 
 
 
 
  is NP-complete for a given graph 
 
 
 
 .
Variants and generalizations
Krivelevich and Yuster generalized the concept of rainbow connection to the vertex version. The rainbow vertex-connection number of a graph 
 
 
 
  is the minimum number of colors needed to color 
 
 
 
  such that for each pair of vertices, there is a path connecting them whose internal vertices are assigned distinct colors, and is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
Chartrand, Okamoto and Zhang generalized the rainbow connection number as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  be an edge-colored nontrivial connected graph of order 
 
 
 
 . A tree 
 
 
 
  is a rainbow tree if no two edges of 
 
 
 
  are assigned the same color. Let 
 
 
 
  be a fixed integer with 
 
 
 
 . An edge coloring of 
 
 
 
  is called a 

 
 -rainbow coloring if for every set 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  vertices of 
 
 
 
 , there is a rainbow tree in 
 
 
 
  containing the vertices of 
 
 
 
 . The 

 
 -rainbow index

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is the minimum number of colors needed in a 
 
 
 
 -rainbow coloring of 
 
 
 
 . A 
 
 
 
 -rainbow coloring using 
 
 
 
  colors is called a minimum 
 
 
 
 -rainbow coloring. Thus 
 
 
 
  is the rainbow connection number of 
 
 
 
 .
