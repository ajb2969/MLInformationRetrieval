   Rainbow coloring      Rainbow coloring   In graph theory , a path in an edge-colored graph is said to be rainbow if no color repeats on it. A graph is said to be rainbow colored if there is a rainbow path between each pair of its vertices . If there is a rainbow shortest path between each pair of vertices, the graph is said to be strong rainbow colored .  Definitions and bounds  The rainbow connection number of a graph   G   G   G   is the minimum number of colors needed to rainbow color   G   G   G   , and is denoted by    rc   (  G  )       rc  G    \text{rc}(G)   . Similarly, the strong rainbow connection number of a graph   G   G   G   is the minimum number of colors needed to strong rainbow color   G   G   G   , and is denoted by    src   (  G  )       src  G    \text{src}(G)   . Clearly, each strong rainbow coloring is also a rainbow coloring, while the converse is not true in general.  It is easy to observe that to rainbow color any connected graph   G   G   G   , we need at least    diam   (  G  )       diam  G    \text{diam}(G)   colors, where    diam   (  G  )       diam  G    \text{diam}(G)   is the diameter of   G   G   G   (i.e. the length of the longest shortest path). On the other hand, we can never use more than   m   m   m   colors, where   m   m   m   denotes the number of edges in   G   G   G   . Finally, because each strong rainbow colored graph is rainbow colored, we have that     diam   (  G  )    ≤   rc   (  G  )    ≤   src   (  G  )    ≤  m          diam  G     rc  G          src  G        m     \text{diam}(G)\leq\text{rc}(G)\leq\text{src}(G)\leq m   .  The following are the extremal cases:        rc   (  G  )    =   src   (  G  )    =  1          rc  G     src  G        1     \text{rc}(G)=\text{src}(G)=1   if and only if   G   G   G   is a complete graph .       rc   (  G  )    =   src   (  G  )    =  m          rc  G     src  G        m     \text{rc}(G)=\text{src}(G)=m   if and only if   G   G   G   is a tree .   Exact rainbow or strong rainbow connection numbers  The rainbow or the strong rainbow connection number has been determined for some structured graph classes:        rc   (   C  n   )    =   src   (   C  n   )    =   ⌈   n  /  2   ⌉           rc   subscript  C  n      src   subscript  C  n             n  2       \text{rc}(C_{n})=\text{src}(C_{n})=\lceil n/2\rceil   , for each integer    n  ≥  4      n  4    n\geq 4   , where    C  n     subscript  C  n    C_{n}   is the cycle graph .         rc   (   W  n   )    =  3        rc   subscript  W  n    3    \text{rc}(W_{n})=3   , for each integer    n  ≥  7      n  7    n\geq 7   , and     src   (   W  n   )    =   ⌈   n  /  3   ⌉         src   subscript  W  n        n  3      \text{src}(W_{n})=\lceil n/3\rceil   , for    n  ≥  3      n  3    n\geq 3   , where    W  n     subscript  W  n    W_{n}   is the wheel graph .   Complexity  The problem of deciding whether     rc   (  G  )    =  2        rc  G   2    \text{rc}(G)=2   for a given graph   G   G   G   is NP-complete . Because     rc   (  G  )    =  2        rc  G   2    \text{rc}(G)=2   if and only if     src   (  G  )    =  2        src  G   2    \text{src}(G)=2   , it follows that deciding if     src   (  G  )    =  2        src  G   2    \text{src}(G)=2   is NP-complete for a given graph   G   G   G   .  Variants and generalizations  Krivelevich and Yuster generalized the concept of rainbow connection to the vertex version. The rainbow vertex-connection number of a graph   G   G   G   is the minimum number of colors needed to color   G   G   G   such that for each pair of vertices, there is a path connecting them whose internal vertices are assigned distinct colors, and is denoted by    rvc   (  G  )       rvc  G    \text{rvc}(G)   .  Chartrand, Okamoto and Zhang generalized the rainbow connection number as follows. Let   G   G   G   be an edge-colored nontrivial connected graph of order   n   n   n   . A tree   T   T   T   is a rainbow tree if no two edges of   T   T   T   are assigned the same color. Let   k   k   k   be a fixed integer with    2  ≤  k  ≤  n        2  k       n     2\leq k\leq n   . An edge coloring of   G   G   G   is called a    k   k   k   -rainbow coloring if for every set   S   S   S   of   k   k   k   vertices of   G   G   G   , there is a rainbow tree in   G   G   G   containing the vertices of   S   S   S   . The    k   k   k   -rainbow index      rx  k    (  G  )        subscript  rx  k   G    \text{rx}_{k}(G)   of   G   G   G   is the minimum number of colors needed in a   k   k   k   -rainbow coloring of   G   G   G   . A   k   k   k   -rainbow coloring using     rx  k    (  G  )        subscript  rx  k   G    \text{rx}_{k}(G)   colors is called a minimum   k   k   k   -rainbow coloring . Thus     rx  2    (  G  )        subscript  rx  2   G    \text{rx}_{2}(G)   is the rainbow connection number of   G   G   G   .
