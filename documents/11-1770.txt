Coase conjecture




Coase conjecture
The '''Coase conjecture''', developed first by [[Ronald Coase]], is an argument in [[monopoly| monopoly theory]]. The conjecture sets up a situation in which a monopolist sells a [[durable good]] to a [[Market (economics)|market]] where resale is impossible and faces [[consumer]]s who have dif
 ferent valuations. The conjecture proposes that a monopolist that does not know individuals' valuations will have to sell its product at a low price if the monopolist tries to separate consumers by offering different prices in different periods. This is because the monopoly is, in effect, in price competition with itself over several periods and the consumer with the highest valuation, if he is patient enough, can simply wait for the lowest price. Thus the monopolist will have to offer a competitive price in the first period which will be low. The conjecture holds only when there is an infinite time horizon, as otherwise a possible action for the monopolist would be to announce a very high price until the second to last period, and then sell at the static monopoly price in the last period. The monopolist could avoid this problem by committing to a stable linear pricing strategy or adopting other business strategies.1
Simple two-consumer model
Imagine there are consumers, called 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with valuations of good with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. The valuations are such as 
 
 
 
  in the first period and then in the second period 
 
 
 
 , hence price discriminating. This will not result in consumer 
 
 
 
  buying in the first period because, by waiting, she could get price equal to 
 
 
 
 . To make consumer 
 
 
indifferent between buying in the first period or the second period, the monopolist will have to charge a price of 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a discount factor between 0 and 1. This price is such as 
 
 
 
 .
Hence by waiting, 
 
 
 
  forces the monopolist to compete on price with its future self.
n consumers
Imagine there are 
 
 
 
  consumers with valuations ranging from 
 
 
 
  to a valuation just above zero. The monopolist will want to sell to the consumer with the lowest valuation. This is because production is costless and by charging a price just above zero it still makes a profit. Hence to separate the consumers, the monopoly will charge first consumer 
 
 
 
  where $n$ is the number of consumers. If the discount factor is high enough this price will be close to zero. Hence the conjecture is proved.
