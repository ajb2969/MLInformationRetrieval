TRNA dimethylallyltransferase

TRNA dimethylallyltransferase (, tRNA prenyltransferase, MiaA, transfer ribonucleate isopentenyltransferase, Delta2-isopentenyl pyrophosphate:tRNA-Delta2-isopentenyl transferase, Delta2-isopentenyl pyrophosphate:transfer ribonucleic acid Delta2-isopentenyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name dimethylallyl-diphosphate: tRNA dimethylallyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

dimethylallyl diphosphate + tRNA

diphosphate + tRNA containing 6-dimethylallyladenosine
 

Formerly known as tRNA isopentenyltransferase (EC 2.5.1.8), but it is now known that dimethylallyl diphosphate, rather than isopentenyl diphosphate, is the substrate.
