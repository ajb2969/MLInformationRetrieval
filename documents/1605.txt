   Congruence-permutable algebra      Congruence-permutable algebra   In universal algebra , two congruences     α  ,  β     α  β    \alpha,\beta   are said to be permutable if     α  ∘  β   =   β  ∘  α         α  β     β  α     \alpha\circ\beta=\beta\circ\alpha   . A congruence-permutable algebra is one in which all congruences are permutable. A variety of algebras is congruence-permutable if every algebra in the variety is congruence-permutable.  A Mal'cev term is a term M for which        M   (  x  ,  x  ,  y  )    =  y  =   M   (  y  ,  x  ,  x  )     .          M   x  x  y    y         M   y  x  x       M(x,x,y)=y=M(y,x,x).     A congruence-permutable variety is one whose signature contains a Mal'cev term.  "  Category:Universal algebra
