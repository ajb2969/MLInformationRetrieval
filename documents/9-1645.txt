Superprocess

An 
 
 
 
 -superprocess, 
 
 
 
 , is a stochastic process on 
 
 
 
  that is usually constructed as a special limit of branching diffusion where the branching mechanism is given by its factorial moment generating function:


 
  and the spatial motion of individual particles is given by the 
 
 
 
 -symmetric stable process with infinitesimal generator

 
 .
The 
 
 
 
  case corresponds to standard Brownian motion and the 
 
 
 
 -superprocess is called the Dawson-Watanabe superprocess or super-Brownian motion.
One of the most important properties of superprocesses is that they are intimately connected with certain nonlinear partial differential equations. The simplest such equation is
