   Superprocess      Superprocess   An    (  α  ,  d  ,  β  )     α  d  β    (\alpha,d,\beta)   - superprocess ,    X   (  t  ,   d  x   )       X   t    d  x      X(t,dx)   , is a stochastic process on    ℝ  ×   ℝ  d       ℝ   superscript  ℝ  d     \mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^{d}   that is usually constructed as a special limit of branching diffusion where the branching mechanism is given by its factorial moment generating function :       Φ   (  s  )    =     1   1  +  β      (   1  -  s   )    1  +  β     +  s         normal-Φ  s         1    1  β     superscript    1  s     1  β     s     \Phi(s)=\frac{1}{1+\beta}(1-s)^{1+\beta}+s   and the spatial motion of individual particles is given by the   α   α   \alpha   -symmetric stable process with infinitesimal generator     Δ  α     subscript  normal-Δ  α    \Delta_{\alpha}   .  The    α  =  2      α  2    \alpha=2   case corresponds to standard Brownian motion and the    (  2  ,  d  ,  1  )     2  d  1    (2,d,1)   -superprocess is called the Dawson-Watanabe superprocess or super-Brownian motion.  One of the most important properties of superprocesses is that they are intimately connected with certain nonlinear partial differential equations . The simplest such equation is         Δ  u   -   u  2    =    0   o   n    ℝ  d     .          normal-Δ  u    superscript  u  2      0  o  n   superscript  ℝ  d      \Delta u-u^{2}=0\ on\ \mathbb{R}^{d}.
