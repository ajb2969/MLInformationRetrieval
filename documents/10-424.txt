   Extensional viscosity      Extensional viscosity   '''Extensional viscosity ''' (also known as elongational viscosity ) is a viscosity coefficient when applied stress is extensional stress . 1   This parameter is often used for characterizing polymer solutions.   Extensional viscosity can be measured using rheometers that apply extensional stress . Acoustic rheometer is one example of such devices.       η  e   =    σ  n    ε  ˙         subscript  η  e      subscript  σ  n    normal-˙  ε      \eta_{e}=\frac{\sigma_{n}}{\dot{\varepsilon}}\,\!     where      η  e     subscript  η  e    \eta_{e}\,\!   is the extensional viscosity or elongational viscosity      σ  n     subscript  σ  n    \sigma_{n}\,\!   is the normal stress      σ  n   =   F  A        subscript  σ  n     F  A     \sigma_{n}=\frac{F}{A}\,\!         ε  ˙     normal-˙  ε    \dot{\varepsilon}\,\!   is the rate of strain      ε  ˙   =    1  L     d  L    d  t          normal-˙  ε       1  L       d  L     d  t       \dot{\varepsilon}=\frac{1}{L}\frac{dL}{dt}\,\!     For a Newtonian Fluid , the uniaxial elongational viscosity is three times the shear viscosity which can be derived using the continuity equation for incompressible fluids.       η  e   =   3  η        subscript  η  e     3  η     \eta_{e}=3\eta\,\!
