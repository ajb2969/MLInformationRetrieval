   Fayet–Iliopoulos D-term      Fayet–Iliopoulos D-term   In theoretical physics , the Fayet–Iliopoulos D-term (introduced by Pierre Fayet and John Iliopoulos ) is a D-term in a supersymmetric theory obtained from a vector superfield  V simply by an integral over all of superspace :       S   F  I    =   ξ   ∫    d  4    θ   V          subscript  S    F  I      ξ       superscript  d  4   θ  V       S_{FI}=\xi\int d^{4}\theta\,V   Because a natural trace must be a part of the expression, the action only exists for U(1) vector superfields.  In terms of the components, it is proportional simply to the last auxiliary D-term of the superfield V . It means that the corresponding D that appears in D-flatness conditions (and whose square enters the ordinary potential) is additively shifted by   ξ   ξ   \xi   , the coefficient.  References   P.
