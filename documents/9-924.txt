Spin representation

In mathematics, the spin representations are particular projective representations of the orthogonal or special orthogonal groups in arbitrary dimension and signature (i.e., including indefinite orthogonal groups). More precisely, they are representations of the spin groups, which are double covers of the special orthogonal groups. They are usually studied over the real or complex numbers, but they can be defined over other fields.
Elements of a spin representation are called spinors. They play an important role in the physical description of fermions such as the electron.
The spin representations may be constructed in several ways, but typically the construction involves (perhaps only implicitly) the choice of a maximal isotropic subspace in the vector representation of the group. Over the real numbers, this usually requires using a complexification of the vector representation. For this reason, it is convenient to define the spin representations over the complex numbers first, and derive real representations by introducing real structures.
The properties of the spin representations depend, in a subtle way, on the dimension and signature of the orthogonal group. In particular, spin representations often admit invariant bilinear forms, which can be used to embed the spin groups into classical Lie groups. In low dimensions, these embeddings are surjective and determine special isomorphisms between the spin groups and more familiar Lie groups; this elucidates the properties of spinors in these dimensions.
Set up
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite-dimensional real or complex vector space with a nondegenerate quadratic form

 
 . The (real or complex) linear maps preserving 
 
 
 
  form the orthogonal group

 
 . The identity component of the group is called the special orthogonal group 
 
 
 
 . (For 
 
 
 
  real with an indefinite quadratic form, this terminology is not standard: the special orthogonal group is usually defined to be a subgroup with two components in this case.) Up to group isomorphism, 
 
 
 
  has a unique connected double cover, the spin group 
 
 
 
 . There is thus a group homomorphism

 
  whose kernel has two elements denoted }, where 
 
 
 
  is the identity element.
The groups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are all Lie groups, and for fixed 
 
 
 
  they have the same Lie algebra, 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is real, then 
 
 
 
  is a real vector subspace of its complexification  V ⊗R C}}, and the quadratic form 
 
 
 
  extends naturally to a quadratic form  on . This embeds 
 
 
 
  as a subgroup of , and hence we may realise 
 
 
 
  as a subgroup of . Furthermore,  is the complexification of 
 
 
 
 .
In the complex case, quadratic forms are determined up to isomorphism by the dimension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . Concretely, we may assume  Cn}} and


 
  The corresponding Lie groups and Lie algebra are denoted 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
In the real case, quadratic forms are determined up to isomorphism by a pair of nonnegative integers 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the dimension of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the signature. Concretely, we may assume  Rn}} and


 
  The corresponding Lie groups and Lie algebra are denoted 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We write  in place of  to make the signature explicit.
The spin representations are, in a sense, the simplest representations of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  that do not come from representations of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . A spin representation is, therefore, a real or complex vector space 
 
 
 
  together with a group homomorphism 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  to the general linear group

 
  such that the element 
 
 
 
  is not in the kernel of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is such a representation, then according to the relation between Lie groups and Lie algebras, it induces a Lie algebra representation, i.e., a Lie algebra homomorphism from 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  to the Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  of endomorphisms of 
 
 
 
  with the commutator bracket.
Spin representations can be analysed according to the following strategy: if 
 
 
 
  is a real spin representation of 
 
 
 
 , then its complexification is a complex spin representation of 
 
 
 
 ; as a representation of 
 
 
 
 , it therefore extends to a complex representation of 
 
 
 
 . Proceeding in reverse, we therefore first construct complex spin representations of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then restrict them to complex spin representations of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then finally analyse possible reductions to real spin representations.
Complex spin representations
Let  with the standard quadratic form 
 
 
 
  so that


 
  The symmetric bilinear form on 
 
 
 
  associated to 
 
 
 
  by polarization is denoted 
 
 
 
 .
Isotropic subspaces and root systems
A standard construction of the spin representations of 
 
 
 
  begins with a choice of a pair  of maximal isotropic subspaces of 
 
 
 
  with  0}}. Let us make such a choice. If 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  and  both have dimension 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , then  W ⊕ W∗}}, whereas if 
 
 
 
 , then  W ⊕ U ⊕ W∗}}, where 
 
 
 
  is the 1-dimensional orthogonal complement to . The bilinear form 
 
 
 
  induces a pairing between 
 
 
 
  and , which must be nondegenerate, because 
 
 
 
  and  are isotropic subspaces and 
 
 
 
  is nondegenerate. Hence 
 
 
 
  and  are dual vector spaces.
More concretely, let  be a basis for 
 
 
 
 . Then there is a unique basis  of  such that


 
  If 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix, then 
 
 
 
  induces an endomorphism of 
 
 
 
  with respect to this basis and the transpose  induces a transformation of  with


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and  in . It follows that the endomorphism  of 
 
 
 
 , equal to 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 ,  on  and zero on 
 
 
 
  (if 
 
 
 
  is odd), is skew,


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , and hence (see classical group) an element of 
 
 
 
 .
Using the diagonal matrices in this construction defines a Cartan subalgebra

 
  of 
 
 
 
 : the rank of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , and the diagonal 
 
 
 
  matrices determine an 
 
 
 
 -dimensional abelian subalgebra.
Let  be the basis of  such that, for a diagonal matrix  is the 
 
 
 
 th diagonal entry of 
 
 
 
 . Clearly this is a basis for . Since the bilinear form identifies 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , explicitly,


1 it is now easy to construct the root system associated to 
 
 
 
 . The root spaces (simultaneous eigenspaces for the action of 
 
 
 
 ) are spanned by the following elements:


 
  with root (simultaneous eigenvalue) 
 
 



 
  (which is in 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  with root 
 
 



 
  with root 
 
 
 
  and, if 
 
 
 
  is odd, and 
 
 
 
  is a nonzero element of 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  with root 
 
 



 
  with root 
 
 
 
  Thus, with respect to the basis , the roots are the vectors in  that are permutations of


 
  together with the permutations of


 
  if 
 
 
 
  is odd.
A system of positive roots is given by  and (for 
 
 
 
  odd) . The corresponding simple roots are


 
  The positive roots are nonnegative integer linear combinations of the simple roots.
Spin representations and their weights
One construction of the spin representations of 
 
 
 
  uses the exterior algebra(s)


 
  and/or 
 
 
 
  There is an action of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that for any element  in  and any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  the action is given by:


 
  where the second term is a contraction (interior multiplication) defined using the bilinear form, which pairs 
 
 
 
  and . This action respects the Clifford relations , and so induces a homomorphism from the Clifford algebra  of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . A similar action can be defined on 
 
 
 
 , so that both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are Clifford modules.
The Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the complexified Lie algebra  in  via the mapping induced by the covering 
 
 



 
  It follows that both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are representations of 
 
 
 
 . They are actually equivalent representations, so we focus on S.
The explicit description shows that the elements  of the Cartan subalgebra 
 
 
 
  act on 
 
 
 
  by


 
  A basis for 
 
 
 
  is given by elements of the form


 
  for 
 
 
 
  and . These clearly span weight spaces for the action of 
 
 
 
 :  has eigenvalue −1/2 on the given basis vector if  for some 
 
 
 
 , and has eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  otherwise.
It follows that the weights of 
 
 
 
 
  are all possible combinations of


 
  and each weight space is one-dimensional. Elements of 
 
 
 
  are called Dirac spinors.
When 
 
 
 
  is even, 
 
 
 
  is not an irreducible representation

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are invariant subspaces. The weights divide into those with an even number of minus signs, and those with an odd number of minus signs. Both S+ and S− are irreducible representations of dimension 2m−1 whose elements are called Weyl spinors. They are also known as chiral spin representations or half-spin representations. With respect to the positive root system above, the highest weights of S+ and S− are


 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. The Clifford action identifies ClnC with End(S) and the even subalgebra is identified with the endomorphisms preserving S+ and S−. The other Clifford module S′ is isomorphic to S in this case.
When n is odd, S is an irreducible representation of so(n,C) of dimension 2m: the Clifford action of a unit vector u ∈ U is given by


 
  and so elements of so(n,C) of the form u∧w or u∧w∗ do not preserve the even and odd parts of the exterior algebra of W. The highest weight of S is


 
  The Clifford action is not faithful on S: ClnC can be identified with End(S) ⊕ End(S′), where u acts with the opposite sign on S′. More precisely, the two representations are related by the parity involution α of ClnC (also known as the principal automorphism), which is the identity on the even subalgebra, and minus the identity on the odd part of ClnC. In other words, there is a linear isomorphism from S to S′, which identifies the action of A in ClnC on S with the action of α(A) on S′.
Bilinear forms
if λ is a weight of S, so is −λ. It follows that S is isomorphic to the dual representation S∗.
When n = 2m + 1 is odd, the isomorphism B: S → S∗ is unique up to scale by Schur's lemma, since S is irreducible, and it defines a nondegenerate invariant bilinear form β on S via


 
  Here invariance means that


 
  for all ξ in so(n,C) and φ, ψ in S — in other words the action of ξ is skew with respect to β. In fact, more is true: S∗ is a representation of the opposite Clifford algebra, and therefore, since ClnC only has two nontrivial simple modules S and S′, related by the parity involution α, there is an antiautomorphism τ of ClnC such that


 
  for any A in ClnC. In fact τ is reversion (the antiautomorphism induced by the identity on V) for m even, and conjugation (the antiautomorphism induced by minus the identity on V) for m odd. These two antiautomorphisms are related by parity involution α, which is the automorphism induced by minus the identity on V. Both satisfy τ(ξ) = −ξ for ξ in so(n,C).
When n = 2m, the situation depends more sensitively upon the parity of m. For m even, a weight λ has an even number of minus signs if and only if −λ does; it follows that there are separate isomorphisms B±: S± → S±∗ of each half-spin representation with its dual, each determined uniquely up to scale. These may be combined into an isomorphism B: S → S∗. For m odd, λ is a weight of S+ if and only if −λ is a weight of S−; thus there is an isomorphism from S+ to S−∗, again unique up to scale, and its transpose provides an isomorphism from S− to S+∗. These may again be combined into an isomorphism B: S → S∗.
For both m even and m odd, the freedom in the choice of B may be restricted to an overall scale by insisting that the bilinear form β corresponding to B satisfies (1), where τ is a fixed antiautomorphism (either reversion or conjugation).
Symmetry and the tensor square
The symmetry properties of β: S ⊗ S → C can be determined using Clifford algebras or representation theory. In fact much more can be said: the tensor square S ⊗ S must decompose into a direct sum of k-forms on V for various k, because its weights are all elements in h∗ whose components belong to {−1,0,1}. Now equivariant linear maps S ⊗ S → ∧kV∗ correspond bijectively to invariant maps ∧kV ⊗ S ⊗ S → C and nonzero such maps can be constructed via the inclusion of ∧kV into the Clifford algebra. Furthermore if β(φ,ψ) = ε β(ψ,φ) and τ has sign εk on ∧kV then


 
  for A in ∧kV.
If n = 2m+1 is odd then it follows from Schur's Lemma that


 
  (both sides have dimension 22m and the representations on the right are inequivalent). Because the symmetries are governed by an involution τ that is either conjugation or reversion, the symmetry of the ∧2jV∗ component alternates with j. Elementary combinatorics gives


 
  and the sign determines which representations occur in S2S and which occur in ∧2S.2 In particular


 
  and


 
  for v ∈ V (which is isomorphic to ∧2mV), confirming that τ is reversion for m even, and conjugation for m odd.
If n = 2m is even, then the analysis is more involved, but the result is a more refined decomposition: S2S±, ∧2S± and S+ ⊗ S− can each be decomposed as a direct sum of k-forms (where for k = m there is a further decomposition into selfdual and antiselfdual m-forms).
The main outcome is a realisation of so(n,C) as a subalgebra of a classical Lie algebra on S, depending upon n modulo 8, according to the following table:

For n ≤ 6, these embeddings are isomorphisms (onto sl rather than gl for n = 6):















Real representations
The complex spin representations of so(n,C) yield real representations S of so(p,q) by restricting the action to the real subalgebras. However, there are additional "reality" structures that are invariant under the action of the real Lie algebras. These come in three types.

There is an invariant complex antilinear map r: S → S with r2 = idS. The fixed point set of r is then a real vector subspace SR of S with SR ⊗ C = S. This is called a real structure.
There is an invariant complex antilinear map j: S → S with j2 = −idS. It follows that the triple i, j and k:=ij make S into a quaternionic vector space SH. This is called a quaternionic structure.
There is an invariant complex antilinear map b: S → S∗ that is invertible. This defines a pseudohermitian bilinear form on S and is called a hermitian structure.

The type of structure invariant under so(p,q) depends only on the signature p − q modulo 8, and is given by the following table.

Description and tables
To complete the description of real representation, we must describe how these structures interact with the invariant bilinear forms. Since n = p + q ≅ p − q mod 2, there are two cases: the dimension and signature are both even, and the dimension and signature are both odd.
The odd case is simpler, there is only one complex spin representation S, and hermitian structures do not occur. Apart from the trivial case n = 1, S is always even-dimensional, say dim S = 2N. The real forms of so(2N,C) are so(K,L) with K + L = 2N and so∗(N,H), while the real forms of sp(2N,C) are sp(2N,R) and sp(K,L) with K + L = N. The presence of a Clifford action of V on S forces K = L in both cases unless pq = 0, in which case KL=0, which is denoted simply so(2N) or sp(N). Hence the odd spin representations may be summarized in the following table.
