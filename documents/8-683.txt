That is, it is a graph of       D   (  x  )    -   x   log  x    -   x   (    2  γ   -  1   )          D  x     x    x      x      2  γ   1      D(x)-x\log x-x(2\gamma-1)     where    D   (  x  )       D  x    D(x)   is the divisor summatory function       D   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  ≤  x     d   (  n  )           D  x     subscript     n  x      d  n      D(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}d(n)     and    d   (  n  )       d  n    d(n)   is the divisor function . Here,    γ  =   0.577  …       γ    0.577  normal-…     \gamma=0.577\ldots   is the Euler-Mascheroni constant . The graph extends up to    x  =   10  4       x   superscript  10  4     x=10^{4}   . The green lines that do not quite bound the picture are a graph of    ±   2   x   7  /  22        plus-or-minus    2   superscript  x    7  22       \pm 2x^{7/22}   and give a general scale for the rate of growth for this function. Curiously, note that the function is not centered on the zero axis, but seems to be closer to the upper curve.  Licensing  Created by Linas Vepstas User:Linas 12 July 2006  "
