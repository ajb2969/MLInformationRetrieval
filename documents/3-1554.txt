   Locus (mathematics)      Locus (mathematics)   (Figure)  Each curve in this example is a locus defined as the conchoid of a circle centered at point P and the line l . In this example, P is 7cm from l .   In geometry , a locus (plural: loci ) is a set of points whose location satisfies or is determined by one or more specified conditions. 1 2  Commonly studied loci  Examples from plane geometry include:   The set of points equidistant from two points is a perpendicular bisector to the line segment connecting the two points. 3  The set of points equidistant from two lines which cross is the angle bisector .  All conic sections are loci: 4   Parabola : the set of points equidistant from a single point (the focus ) and a line (the directrix ).  Circle : the set of points for which the distance from a single point is constant (the radius ). The set of points for each of which the ratio of the distances to two given foci is a positive constant (that is not 1) is referred to as a Circle of Apollonius .  Hyperbola : the set of points for each of which the absolute value of the difference between the distances to two given foci is a constant.  Ellipse : the set of points for each of which the sum of the distances to two given foci is a constant. The circle is the special case in which the two foci coincide with each other.    Proof of a locus  In order to prove that a geometric shape is the correct locus for a given set of conditions, one generally divides the proof into two stages: 5   Proof that all the points that satisfy the conditions are on the given shape.  Proof that all the points on the given shape satisfy the conditions.   Examples  (Figure)  (distance PA ) = 3.(distance PB )   First example  We find the locus of the points P that have a given ratio of distances k = d 1 / d 2 to two given points. In this example we choose k = 3, A (-1,0) and B (0,2) as the fixed points.    P ( x,y ) is a point of the locus         ⇔    |   P  A   |   =   3   |   P  B   |        normal-⇔  absent        P  A      3      P  B        \Leftrightarrow|PA|=3|PB|          ⇔     |   P  A   |   2   =   9    |   P  B   |   2        normal-⇔  absent     superscript      P  A    2     9   superscript      P  B    2       \Leftrightarrow|PA|^{2}=9|PB|^{2}          ⇔      (   x  +  1   )   2   +    (   y  -  0   )   2    =    9    (   x  -  0   )   2    +   9    (   y  -  2   )   2         normal-⇔  absent       superscript    x  1   2    superscript    y  0   2        9   superscript    x  0   2      9   superscript    y  2   2        \Leftrightarrow(x+1)^{2}+(y-0)^{2}=9(x-0)^{2}+9(y-2)^{2}          ⇔      8   (    x  2   +   y  2    )    -   2  x   -   36  y    +  35   =  0      normal-⇔  absent          8     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       2  x     36  y    35   0     \Leftrightarrow 8(x^{2}+y^{2})-2x-36y+35=0          ⇔      (   x  -   1  8    )   2   +    (   y  -   9  4    )   2    =   45  64       normal-⇔  absent       superscript    x    1  8    2    superscript    y    9  4    2      45  64      \Leftrightarrow\left(x-\frac{1}{8}\right)^{2}+\left(y-\frac{9}{4}\right)^{2}=%

It is the circle of Apollonius defined by these values of k , A , and B .  Second example  A triangle ABC has a fixed side [ AB ] with length c . We determine the locus of the third vertex  C such that the medians from A and C are orthogonal .  We choose an orthonormal  coordinate system such that A (- c /2,0), B ( c /2,0). C ( x,y ) is the variable third vertex. The center of [ BC ] is M ( (2 x+c )/4, y /2 ). The median from C has a slope y / x . The median AM has slope 2 y /(2 x +3 c ).  (Figure)  The locus is a circle     C ( x,y ) is a point of the locus       ⇔   normal-⇔   \Leftrightarrow   The medians from A and C are orthogonal       ⇔     y  x   ⋅    2  y     2  x   +   3  c      =   -  1       normal-⇔  absent     normal-⋅    y  x       2  y       2  x     3  c        1      \Leftrightarrow\frac{y}{x}\cdot\frac{2y}{2x+3c}=-1          ⇔     2   y  2    +   2   x  2    +   3  c  x    =  0      normal-⇔  absent        2   superscript  y  2      2   superscript  x  2      3  c  x    0     \Leftrightarrow 2y^{2}+2x^{2}+3cx=0          ⇔     x  2   +   y  2   +    (    3  c   /  2   )   x    =  0      normal-⇔  absent       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2         3  c   2   x    0     \Leftrightarrow x^{2}+y^{2}+(3c/2)x=0          ⇔      (   x  +    3  c   /  4    )   2   +   y  2    =    9   c  2    /  16       normal-⇔  absent       superscript    x      3  c   4    2    superscript  y  2        9   superscript  c  2    16      \Leftrightarrow(x+3c/4)^{2}+y^{2}=9c^{2}/16      The locus of the vertex C is a circle with center (-3 c /4,0) and radius 3 c /4.  Third example  A locus can also be defined by two associated curves depending on one common parameter . If the parameter varies, the intersection points of the associated curves describe the locus.  In the figure, the points K and L are fixed points on a given line m . The line k is a variable line through K . The line l through L is perpendicular to k . The angle   α   α   \alpha   between k and m is the parameter. k and l are associated lines depending on the common parameter. The variable intersection point S of k and l describes a circle. This circle is the locus of the intersection point of the two associated lines.  Fourth example  A locus of points need not be one-dimensional (as a circle, line, etc.).
