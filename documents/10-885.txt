2-methylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 2-methylacyl-CoA dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-methylbutanoyl-CoA + acceptor 
 
 
 
  2-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-methylbutanoyl-CoA and acceptor, whereas its two products are 2-methylbut-2-enoyl-CoA and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-methylbutanoyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include branched-chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, 2-methyl branched chain acyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and 2-methylbutanoyl-CoA:(acceptor) oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation.
