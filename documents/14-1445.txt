   Radical extension      Radical extension   In mathematics and more specifically in field theory , a radical extension of a field  K is an extension of K that is obtained by adjoining a sequence of n th roots of elements.  Definition  A simple radical extension is a simple extension  F / K generated by a single element α satisfying     α  n   =  b       superscript  α  n   b    \alpha^{n}=b   for an element b of K . In characteristic  p , we also take an extension by a root of an Artin–Schreier polynomial to be a simple radical extension. A radical series is a tower     K  =   F  0   <   F  1   <  ⋯  <   F  k         K   subscript  F  0         subscript  F  1        normal-⋯        subscript  F  k      K=F_{0}   where each extension     F  i   /   F   i  -  1         subscript  F  i    subscript  F    i  1      F_{i}/F_{i-1}   is a simple radical extension.  Properties   If E is a radical extension of F and F is a radical extension of K then E is a radical extension of K .  If E and F are radical extensions of K in a common overfield C , then the compositum  EF is a radical extension of K .  If E is a radical extension of F and E > K > F then E is a radical extension of K .   These three properties show that the class of radical extensions is a distinguished class of field extensions .  Solubility by radicals  Radical extensions occur naturally when solving polynomial equations in radicals . In fact a solution in radicals is the expression of the solution as an element of a radical series: a polynomial f over a field K is said to be solvable by radicals if there is a splitting field of f over K contained in a radical extension of K .  The Abel–Ruffini theorem states that such a solution by radicals does not exist, in general, for equations of degree at least five. Évariste Galois has shown that an equation is solvable in radicals if and only if its Galois group is solvable . The proof is based on the fundamental theorem of Galois theory and the following theorem.  The proof is related with Lagrange resolvents . Let   ω   ω   \omega   be a primitive n th root of unity (belonging to K ). If the extension is generated by   α   α   \alpha   with     x  n   -  a       superscript  x  n   a    x^{n}-a   as a minimal polynomial , the mapping    α  ↦   ω  α      maps-to  α    ω  α     \alpha\mapsto\omega\alpha   induces a K -automorphism of the extension that generates the Galois group, showing the "only if" implication. Conversely, if   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a K -automorphism generating the Galois group, and   β   β   \beta   is a generator of the extension, let       α  =    ∑   i  =  0    n  -  1      ω   -  i     ϕ  i    (  β  )      .      α    superscript   subscript     i  0      n  1       superscript  ω    i     superscript  ϕ  i   β      \alpha=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}\omega^{-i}\phi^{i}(\beta).   The relation     ϕ   (  α  )    =   ω  α         ϕ  α     ω  α     \phi(\alpha)=\omega\alpha   implies that the product of the conjugates of   α   α   \alpha   belongs to K , and is equal to the product of    α  n     superscript  α  n    \alpha^{n}   by the product of the n th roots of unit. As the product of the n th roots of units is    ±  1     plus-or-minus  1    \pm 1   , this implies that      α  n   ∈  K   ,       superscript  α  n   K    \alpha^{n}\in K,   and thus that the extension is a radical extension.  It follows from this theorem that a Galois extension may be expressed as a radical series if and only if its Galois group is solvable. This is, in modern terminology, the criterion of solvability by radicals that was provided by Galois. The proof uses the fact that the Galois closure of a simple radical extension of degree n is the extension of it by a primitive n th root of unity, and that the Galois group of the n th roots of unity is cyclic.
