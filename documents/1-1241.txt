   A-law algorithm      A-law algorithm   (Figure)  Graph of μ-law & A-law algorithms   An A-law algorithm is a standard companding algorithm, used in European 8-bit PCM  digital  communications systems to optimize, i.e., modify, the dynamic range of an analog signal for digitizing.  It is similar to the μ-law algorithm used in North America and Japan .  For a given input x , the equation for A-law encoding is as follows,       F   (  x  )    =    sgn   (  x  )     {         A   |  x  |     1  +   ln   (  A  )       ,       |  x  |   <    1  A             1  +   ln   (   A   |  x  |    )      1  +   ln   (  A  )       ,         1  A    ≤   |  x  |   ≤  1   ,              F  x      sgn  x    cases      A    x      1    A         x     1  A        1      A    x        1    A           1  A     x        1        F(x)=\operatorname{sgn}(x)\begin{cases}{A|x|\over 1+\ln(A)},&|x|<{1\over A}\\
 \frac{1+\ln(A|x|)}{1+\ln(A)},&{1\over A}\leq|x|\leq 1,\end{cases}     where A is the compression parameter. In Europe,    A   =  ′′′    87.6  ′′′       superscript   ′′′   A   superscript  87.6  ′′′     A=^{\prime\prime\prime}87.6^{\prime\prime\prime}   .  A-law expansion is given by the inverse function,        F   -  1     (  y  )    =    sgn   (  y  )     {          |  y  |    (   1  +   ln   (  A  )     )    A    ,       |  y  |   <    1   1  +   ln   (  A  )                exp   (     |  y  |    (   1  +   ln   (  A  )     )    -  1   )    A    ,        1   1  +   ln   (  A  )       ≤   |  y  |   <  1.               superscript  F    1    y      sgn  y    cases        y     1    A     A       y     1    1    A                y     1    A     1    A         1    1    A       y        1.        F^{-1}(y)=\operatorname{sgn}(y)\begin{cases}{|y|(1+\ln(A))\over A},&|y|<{1%
 \over 1+\ln(A)}\\
 {\exp(|y|(1+\ln(A))-1)\over A},&{1\over 1+\ln(A)}\leq|y|<1.\end{cases}     The reason for this encoding is that the wide dynamic range of speech does not lend itself well to efficient linear digital encoding. A-law encoding effectively reduces the dynamic range of the signal, thereby increasing the coding efficiency and resulting in a signal-to- distortion ratio that is superior to that obtained by linear encoding for a given number of bits.  Comparison to μ-law  The μ-law algorithm provides a greater larger dynamic range than the A-law at the cost of worse proportional distortion for small signals. By convention, A-law is used for an international connection if at least one country uses it.
