   Weierstrass product inequality      Weierstrass product inequality   In mathematics , the Weierstrass product inequality states that given real numbers 0 ≤ a , b , c , d ≤ 1, it follows that  $$(1-a)(1-b)(1-c)(1-d)+a+b+c+d \geq 1. \,$$  The inequality is named after the German  mathematician  Karl Weierstrass .
