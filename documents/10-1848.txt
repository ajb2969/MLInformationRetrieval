Lipoyl synthase




Lipoyl synthase

In enzymology, a lipoyl synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

protein N6-(octanoyl)lysine + 2 sulfur + 2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine $\rightleftharpoons$ protein N6-(lipoyl)lysine + 2 L-methionine + 2 5'-deoxyadenosine
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are protein N6-(octanoyl)lysine, sulfur, and S-adenosyl-L-methionine, whereas its 3 products are protein N6-(lipoyl)lysine, L-methionine, and 5'-deoxyadenosine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfurtransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. This enzyme participates in lipoic acid metabolism, where it performs the final step in lipoic acid biosynthesis.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is protein N6-(octanoyl)lysine:sulfur sulfurtransferase. Other names in common use include:

LS,
LipA,
lipoate synthase, and
protein 6-N-(octanoyl)lysine:sulfur sulfurtransferase.
