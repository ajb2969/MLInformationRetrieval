   Discrete Morse theory      Discrete Morse theory  '''Discrete Morse theory''' is a [[comb inatorial]] adaptation of Morse theory developed by Robin Forman . The theory has various practical applications in diverse fields of applied mathematics and computer science , such as configuration spaces , 1  homology computation, 2  denoising , 3 and mesh compression . 4  Notation regarding CW complexes  Let   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   be a CW complex . Define the incidence function     κ  :    𝒳  ×  𝒳   →  ℤ      normal-:  κ   normal-→    𝒳  𝒳   ℤ     \kappa:\mathcal{X}\times\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{Z}   in the following way: given two cells   σ   σ   \sigma   and   τ   τ   \tau   in   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   , let    κ   (  σ  ,  τ  )       κ   σ  τ     \kappa(\sigma,~{}\tau)   be the degree of the attaching map from the boundary of   σ   σ   \sigma   to   τ   τ   \tau   . The boundary operator    ∂     \partial   on   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   is defined by       ∂   (  σ  )    =    ∑   τ  ∈  𝒳     κ   (  σ  ,  τ  )   τ          σ     subscript     τ  𝒳      κ   σ  τ   τ      \partial(\sigma)=\sum_{\tau\in\mathcal{X}}\kappa(\sigma,\tau)\tau     It is a defining property of boundary operators that     ∂  ∘  ∂   ≡  0           0    \partial\circ\partial\equiv 0   . In more axiomatic definitions 5 one can find the requirement that      ∀  σ   ,   τ  ′    ∈  𝒳        for-all  σ    superscript  τ  normal-′    𝒳    \forall\sigma,\tau^{\prime}\in\mathcal{X}           ∑   τ  ∈  𝒳     κ   (  σ  ,  τ  )   κ   (  τ  ,   τ  ′   )     =  0        subscript     τ  𝒳      κ   σ  τ   κ   τ   superscript  τ  normal-′      0    \sum_{\tau\in\mathcal{X}}\kappa(\sigma,\tau)\kappa(\tau,\tau^{\prime})=0     which is a corollary of the above definition of the boundary operator and the requirement that     ∂  ∘  ∂   ≡  0           0    \partial\circ\partial\equiv 0   .  Discrete Morse functions  A real -valued function    μ  :   𝒳  →  ℝ      normal-:  μ   normal-→  𝒳  ℝ     \mu:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}   is a discrete Morse function if it satisfies the following two properties:   For any cell    σ  ∈  𝒳      σ  𝒳    \sigma\in\mathcal{X}   , the number of cells    τ  ∈  𝒳      τ  𝒳    \tau\in\mathcal{X}   in the boundary of   σ   σ   \sigma   which satisfy     μ   (  σ  )    ≤   μ   (  τ  )          μ  σ     μ  τ     \mu(\sigma)\leq\mu(\tau)   is at most one.  For any cell    σ  ∈  𝒳      σ  𝒳    \sigma\in\mathcal{X}   , the number of cells    τ  ∈  𝒳      τ  𝒳    \tau\in\mathcal{X}   containing   σ   σ   \sigma   in their boundary which satisfy     μ   (  σ  )    ≥   μ   (  τ  )          μ  σ     μ  τ     \mu(\sigma)\geq\mu(\tau)   is at most one.   It can be shown 6 that the cardinalities in the two conditions cannot both be one simultaneously for a fixed cell   σ   σ   \sigma   , provided that   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   is a regular CW complex. In this case, each cell    σ  ∈  𝒳      σ  𝒳    \sigma\in\mathcal{X}   can be paired with at most one exceptional cell    τ  ∈  𝒳      τ  𝒳    \tau\in\mathcal{X}   : either a boundary cell with larger   μ   μ   \mu   value, or a co-boundary cell with smaller   μ   μ   \mu   value. The cells which have no pairs, i.e., their function values are strictly higher than their boundary cells and strictly lower than their co-boundary cells are called critical cells. Thus, a discrete Morse function partitions the CW complex into three distinct cell collections    𝒳  =   𝒜  ⊔  𝒦  ⊔  𝒬       𝒳   square-union  𝒜  𝒦  𝒬     \mathcal{X}=\mathcal{A}\sqcup\mathcal{K}\sqcup\mathcal{Q}   , where:      𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   denotes the critical cells which are unpaired,     𝒦   𝒦   \mathcal{K}   denotes cells which are paired with boundary cells, and     𝒬   𝒬   \mathcal{Q}   denotes cells which are paired with co-boundary cells.   By construction, there is a bijection of sets between   k   k   k   -dimensional cells in   𝒦   𝒦   \mathcal{K}   and the    (   k  -  1   )      k  1    (k-1)   -dimensional cells in   𝒬   𝒬   \mathcal{Q}   , which can be denoted by     p  k   :    𝒦  k   →   𝒬   k  -  1        normal-:   superscript  p  k    normal-→   superscript  𝒦  k    superscript  𝒬    k  1       p^{k}:\mathcal{K}^{k}\to\mathcal{Q}^{k-1}   for each natural number    k   k   k   . It is an additional technical requirement that for each    K  ∈   𝒦  k       K   superscript  𝒦  k     K\in\mathcal{K}^{k}   , the degree of the attaching map from the boundary of   K   K   K   to its paired cell      p  k    (  K  )    ∈  𝒬         superscript  p  k   K   𝒬    p^{k}(K)\in\mathcal{Q}   is a unit in the underlying ring of   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   . For instance, over the integers    ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   , the only allowed values are    ±  1     plus-or-minus  1    \pm 1   . This technical requirement is guaranteed when one assumes that   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   is a regular CW complex over   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   .  The fundamental result of discrete Morse theory establishes that the CW complex   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   is isomorphic on the level of homology to a new complex   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   consisting of only the critical cells. The paired cells in   𝒦   𝒦   \mathcal{K}   and   𝒬   𝒬   \mathcal{Q}   describe gradient paths between adjacent critical cells which can be used to obtain the boundary operator on   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   . Some details of this construction are provided in the next section.  The Morse complex  A gradient path is a sequence of paired cells      ρ  =   (   Q  1   ,   K  1   ,   Q  2   ,   K  2   ,  …  ,   Q  M   ,   K  M   )       ρ    subscript  Q  1    subscript  K  1    subscript  Q  2    subscript  K  2   normal-…   subscript  Q  M    subscript  K  M      \rho=(Q_{1},K_{1},Q_{2},K_{2},\ldots,Q_{M},K_{M})     satisfying     Q  m   =   p   (   K  m   )         subscript  Q  m     p   subscript  K  m      Q_{m}=p(K_{m})   and     κ   (   K  m   ,   Q   m  +  1    )    ≠  0        κ    subscript  K  m    subscript  Q    m  1      0    \kappa(K_{m},~{}Q_{m+1})\neq 0   . The index of this gradient path is defined to be the integer       ν   (  ρ  )    =     ∑   m  =  1    M  -  1    -   κ   (   K  m   ,   Q   m  +  1    )       ∑   m  =  1   M    κ   (   K  m   ,   Q  m   )            ν  ρ        superscript   subscript     m  1      M  1      κ    subscript  K  m    subscript  Q    m  1         superscript   subscript     m  1    M     κ    subscript  K  m    subscript  Q  m         \nu(\rho)=\frac{\sum_{m=1}^{M-1}-\kappa(K_{m},Q_{m+1})}{\sum_{m=1}^{M}\kappa(K%
 _{m},Q_{m})}   .  The division here makes sense because the incidence between paired cells must be    ±  1     plus-or-minus  1    \pm 1   . Note that by construction, the values of the discrete Morse function   μ   μ   \mu   must decrease across   ρ   ρ   \rho   . The path   ρ   ρ   \rho   is said to connect two critical cells     A  ,   A  ′    ∈  𝒜       A   superscript  A  normal-′    𝒜    A,A^{\prime}\in\mathcal{A}   if     κ   (  A  ,   Q  1   )    ≠  0  ≠   κ   (   K  M   ,   A  ′   )            κ   A   subscript  Q  1     0         κ    subscript  K  M    superscript  A  normal-′        \kappa(A,Q_{1})\neq 0\neq\kappa(K_{M},A^{\prime})   . This relationship may be expressed as    A   →  ρ    A  ′       superscript  normal-→  ρ   A   superscript  A  normal-′     A\stackrel{\rho}{\to}A^{\prime}   . The multiplicity of this connection is defined to be the integer     m   (  ρ  )    =       κ   (  A  ,   Q  1   )    ⋅  ν    (  ρ  )    ⋅  κ    (   K  M   ,  A  )          m  ρ      normal-⋅     normal-⋅    κ   A   subscript  Q  1     ν   ρ   κ     subscript  K  M   A      m(\rho)=\kappa(A,Q_{1})\cdot\nu(\rho)\cdot\kappa(K_{M},A)   . Finally, the Morse boundary operator on the critical cells   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is defined by       Δ   (  A  )    =    κ   (  A  ,   A  ′   )    +    ∑   A   →  ρ    A  ′      m   (  ρ  )    A  ′            normal-Δ  A       κ   A   superscript  A  normal-′       subscript     superscript  normal-→  ρ   A   superscript  A  normal-′       m  ρ   superscript  A  normal-′        \Delta(A)=\kappa(A,A^{\prime})+\sum_{A\stackrel{\rho}{\to}A^{\prime}}m(\rho)A^%
 {\prime}     where the sum is taken over all gradient path connections from   A   A   A   to    A  ′     superscript  A  normal-′    A^{\prime}   .  Basic Results  Many of the familiar results from continuous Morse theory apply in the discrete setting.  The Morse Inequalities  Let   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   be a Morse complex associated to the CW complex   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   . The number     m  q   =   |   𝒜  q   |        subscript  m  q      subscript  𝒜  q      m_{q}=|\mathcal{A}_{q}|   of   q   q   q   -cells in   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is called the    q   t  h      superscript  q    t  h     q^{th}    Morse number . Let    β  q     subscript  β  q    \beta_{q}   denote the    q   t  h      superscript  q    t  h     q^{th}    Betti number of   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   . Then, for any    N  >  0      N  0    N>0   , the following inequalities 7 hold       m  N   ≥   β  N        subscript  m  N    subscript  β  N     m_{N}\geq\beta_{N}   , and          m  N   -   m   N  -  1     +  …   ±   m  0    ≥      β  N   -   β   N  -  1     +  …   ±   β  0         plus-or-minus       subscript  m  N    subscript  m    N  1     normal-…    subscript  m  0     plus-or-minus       subscript  β  N    subscript  β    N  1     normal-…    subscript  β  0      m_{N}-m_{N-1}+\ldots\pm m_{0}\geq\beta_{N}-\beta_{N-1}+\ldots\pm\beta_{0}     Moreover, the Euler characteristic     χ   (  𝒳  )       χ  𝒳    \chi(\mathcal{X})   of   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   satisfies       χ   (  𝒳  )    =      m  0   -   m  1    +  …   ±   m   dim  𝒳           χ  𝒳    plus-or-minus       subscript  m  0    subscript  m  1    normal-…    subscript  m   dimension  𝒳       \chi(\mathcal{X})=m_{0}-m_{1}+\ldots\pm m_{\dim\mathcal{X}}     Discrete Morse Homology and Homotopy Type  Let   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   be a regular CW complex with boundary operator   ∂     \partial   and a discrete Morse function    μ  :   𝒳  →  ℝ      normal-:  μ   normal-→  𝒳  ℝ     \mu:\mathcal{X}\to\mathbb{R}   . Let   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   be the associated Morse complex with Morse boundary operator   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   . Then, there is an isomorphism 8 of Homology groups as well as homotopy groups.
