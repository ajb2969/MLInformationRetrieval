   Draft:Main theorem of elimination theory      Draft:Main theorem of elimination theory   The main theorem of elimination theory states that a projective scheme is proper .  Sketch of proof  We need to show that    p  :    𝐏  R   →   Spec  R       normal-:  p   normal-→   subscript  𝐏  R    Spec  R      p:\mathbf{P}_{R}\to\operatorname{Spec}R   is closed for a ring R . Thus, let    X  ⊂   𝐏  R       X   subscript  𝐏  R     X\subset\mathbf{P}_{R}   be a closed subset, defined by a homogeneous ideal I of    R   [   x  0   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]       R    subscript  x  0   normal-…   subscript  x  n      R[x_{0},\dots,x_{n}]   . Let       Z  d   =   {   y  ∈   Spec  R    |    I  y   ⊅    (   x  0   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   d    }        subscript  Z  d    conditional-set    y   Spec  R     not-superset-of   subscript  I  y    superscript    subscript  x  0   normal-…   subscript  x  n    d       Z_{d}=\{y\in\operatorname{Spec}R|I_{y}\not\supset(x_{0},\dots,x_{n})^{d}\}   where    I  y     subscript  I  y    I_{y}   is Then:       p   (  X  )    =    ∩  d    Z  d          p  X     subscript   d    subscript  Z  d      \textstyle p(X)=\cap_{d}Z_{d}   . Thus, it is enough to prove    Z  d     subscript  Z  d    Z_{d}   is closed. Let M be the matrix whose entries are coefficients of monomials of degree d in    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   in       x  0   i  0    ⋯   x  n   i  n    f       superscript   subscript  x  0    subscript  i  0    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n    subscript  i  n    f    x_{0}^{i_{0}}\cdots x_{n}^{i_{n}}f   with homogeneous polynomials f in I and      i  0   +  …  +   i  n   +   deg  f    =  d         subscript  i  0   normal-…   subscript  i  n    deg  f    d    i_{0}+\dots+i_{n}+\operatorname{deg}f=d   . Then the number of columns of M , denoted by q , is the number of monomials of degree d in    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   (imagine a system of equations.) We allow M to have infinitely many rows.  Then     y  ∈   Z  d    ⇔   M   (  y  )       normal-⇔    y   subscript  Z  d      M  y     y\in Z_{d}\Leftrightarrow M(y)   has rank all the    q  ×  q      q  q    q\times q   -minors vanish at y .
