Draft:Main theorem of elimination theory

The main theorem of elimination theory states that a projective scheme is proper.
Sketch of proof
We need to show that 
 
 
 
  is closed for a ring R. Thus, let 
 
 
 
  be a closed subset, defined by a homogeneous ideal I of 
 
 
 
 . Let


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is Then:


 
 . Thus, it is enough to prove 
 
 
 
  is closed. Let M be the matrix whose entries are coefficients of monomials of degree d in 
 
 
 
  in


 
  with homogeneous polynomials f in I and 
 
 
 
 . Then the number of columns of M, denoted by q, is the number of monomials of degree d in 
 
 
 
  (imagine a system of equations.) We allow M to have infinitely many rows.
Then 
 
 
 
  has rank
