Naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase

In enzymology, a naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

naphthalene + NADH + H+ + O2

 
  (1R,2S)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol + NAD+


The 4 substrates of this enzyme are naphthalene, NADH, H+, and O2, whereas its two products are (1R,2S)-1,2-dihydronaphthalene-1,2-diol and NAD+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of two atoms o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is naphthalene,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (1,2-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include naphthalene dioxygenase, and naphthalene oxygenase. This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways: 1- and 2-methylnaphthalene degradation, naphthalene and anthracene degradation, fluorene degradation, and ethylbenzene degradation. It employs one cofactor, iron.
