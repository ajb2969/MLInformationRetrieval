   Image-based modeling and rendering      Image-based modeling and rendering   In computer graphics and computer vision , image-based modeling and rendering ( IBMR ) methods rely on a set of two-dimensional images of a scene to generate a three-dimensional model and then render some novel views of this scene.  The traditional approach of computer graphics has been used to create a geometric model in 3D and try to reproject it onto a two-dimensional image. Computer vision, conversely, is mostly focused on detecting, grouping, and extracting features (edges, faces, etc. ) present in a given picture and then trying to interpret them as three-dimensional clues. Image-based modeling and rendering allows the use of multiple two-dimensional images in order to generate directly novel two-dimensional images, skipping the manual modeling stage.  Light modeling  Instead of considering only the physical model of a solid, IBMR methods usually focus more on light modeling. The fundamental concept behind IBMR is the plenoptic illumination function which is a parametrisation of the light field . The plenoptic function describes the light rays contained in a given volume. It can be represented with seven dimensions: a ray is defined by its position    (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )     x  y  z    (x,y,z)   , its orientation    (  θ  ,  ϕ  )     θ  ϕ    (\theta,\phi)   , its wavelength    (  λ  )    λ   (\lambda)   and its time    (  t  )    t   (t)       P   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ,  θ  ,  ϕ  ,  λ  ,  t  )       P   x  y  z  θ  ϕ  λ  t     P(x,y,z,\theta,\phi,\lambda,t)   . IBMR methods try to approximate the plenoptic function to render a novel set of two-dimensional images from another. Given the high dimensionality of this function, practical methods place constraints on the parameters in order to reduce this number (typically to 2 to 4).
