   Acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP transferase      Acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP transferase   Acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP transferase (, acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP-SH transferase , acetyl-S-acyl-carrier protein:malonate acyl-carrier-protein-transferase , MdcA , MadA , ACP transferase , malonate/acetyl-CoA transferase , malonate:ACP transferase , acetyl-S-acyl carrier protein:malonate acyl carrier protein-SH transferase ) is an enzyme with system name acetyl-(acyl-carrier-protein):malonate S-(acyl-carrier-protein)transferase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   acetyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + malonate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + acetate    This is the first step in the catalysis of malonate decarboxylation .
