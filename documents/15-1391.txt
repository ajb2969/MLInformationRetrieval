Acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP transferase

Acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP transferase (, acetyl-S-ACP:malonate ACP-SH transferase, acetyl-S-acyl-carrier protein:malonate acyl-carrier-protein-transferase, MdcA, MadA, ACP transferase, malonate/acetyl-CoA transferase, malonate:ACP transferase, acetyl-S-acyl carrier protein:malonate acyl carrier protein-SH transferase) is an enzyme with system name acetyl-(acyl-carrier-protein):malonate S-(acyl-carrier-protein)transferase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

acetyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + malonate

 
  malonyl-[acyl-carrier protein] + acetate


This is the first step in the catalysis of malonate decarboxylation.
