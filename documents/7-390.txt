   Banach bundle      Banach bundle   In mathematics , a Banach bundle is a vector bundle each of whose fibres is a Banach space , i.e. a complete  normed vector space , possibly of infinite dimension.  Definition of a Banach bundle  Let M be a Banach manifold of class C p with p ≥ 0, called the base space ; let E be a topological space , called the total space ; let π : E → M be a surjective  continuous map . Suppose that for each point x ∈ M , the fibre  E x = π −1 ( x ) has been given the structure of a Banach space. Let      {   U  i   |   i  ∈  I   }     conditional-set   subscript  U  i     i  I     \{U_{i}|i\in I\}     be an open cover of M . Suppose also that for each i ∈ I , there is a Banach space X i and a map τ i       τ  i   :     π   -  1     (   U  i   )    →    U  i   ×   X  i        normal-:   subscript  τ  i    normal-→     superscript  π    1     subscript  U  i       subscript  U  i    subscript  X  i       \tau_{i}:\pi^{-1}(U_{i})\to U_{i}\times X_{i}     such that   the map τ i is a homeomorphism commuting with the projection onto U i , i.e. the following diagram commutes :           and for each x ∈ U i the induced map τ ix on the fibre E x           τ   i  x    :     π   -  1     (  x  )    →   X  i       normal-:   subscript  τ    i  x     normal-→     superscript  π    1    x    subscript  X  i      \tau_{ix}:\pi^{-1}(x)\to X_{i}         is an invertible  continuous linear map , i.e. an isomorphism in the category of topological vector spaces ;    if U i and U j are two members of the open cover, then the map           U  i   ∩   U  j    →   Lin   (   X  i   ;   X  j   )       normal-→     subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j      Lin    subscript  X  i    subscript  X  j       U_{i}\cap U_{j}\to\mathrm{Lin}(X_{i};X_{j})         x  ↦    (    τ  j   ∘   τ  i   -  1     )   x      maps-to  x   subscript     subscript  τ  j    superscript   subscript  τ  i     1     x     x\mapsto(\tau_{j}\circ\tau_{i}^{-1})_{x}         is a morphism (a differentiable map of class C p ), where Lin( X ; Y ) denotes the space of all continuous linear maps from a topological vector space X to another topological vector space Y .   The collection {( U i , τ i )| i ∈ I } is called a trivialising covering for π : E → M , and the maps τ i are called trivialising maps . Two trivialising coverings are said to be equivalent if their union again satisfies the two conditions above. An equivalence class of such trivialising coverings is said to determine the structure of a Banach bundle on π : E → M .  If all the spaces X i are isomorphic as topological vector spaces, then they can be assumed all to be equal to the same space X . In this case, π : E → M is said to be a Banach bundle with fibre  X . If M is a connected space then this is necessarily the case, since the set of points x ∈ M for which there is a trivialising map       τ   i  x    :     π   -  1     (  x  )    →  X      normal-:   subscript  τ    i  x     normal-→     superscript  π    1    x   X     \tau_{ix}:\pi^{-1}(x)\to X     for a given space X is both open and closed .  In the finite-dimensional case, the second condition above is implied by the first.  Examples of Banach bundles   If V is any Banach space, the tangent space T x V to V at any point x ∈ V is isomorphic in an obvious way to V itself. The tangent bundle T V of V is then a Banach bundle with the usual projection          π  :    T  V   →  V    ;     normal-:  π   normal-→    normal-T  V   V     \pi:\mathrm{T}V\to V;           (  x  ,  v  )   ↦  x   .     maps-to   x  v   x    (x,v)\mapsto x.         This bundle is "trivial" in the sense that T V admits a globally defined trivialising map: the identity function            τ  =  id   :     π   -  1     (  V  )    =   T  V   →   V  ×  V     ;     normal-:    τ  id          superscript  π    1    V     normal-T  V     normal-→      V  V       \tau=\mathrm{id}:\pi^{-1}(V)=\mathrm{T}V\to V\times V;           (  x  ,  v  )   ↦   (  x  ,  v  )    .     maps-to   x  v    x  v     (x,v)\mapsto(x,v).         If M is any Banach manifold, the tangent bundle T M of M forms a Banach bundle with respect to the usual projection, but it may not be trivial.    Similarly, the cotangent bundle T* M , whose fibre over a point x ∈ M is the topological dual space to the tangent space at x :            π   -  1     (  x  )    =    T  x  *   M   =    (    T  x   M   )   *    ;           superscript  π    1    x      superscript   subscript  normal-T  x     M         superscript     subscript  normal-T  x   M        \pi^{-1}(x)=\mathrm{T}_{x}^{*}M=(\mathrm{T}_{x}M)^{*};         also forms a Banach bundle with respect to the usual projection onto M .    There is a connection between Bochner spaces and Banach bundles. Consider, for example, the Bochner space X = L ²([0, T ]; H 1 (Ω)), which might arise as a useful object when studying the heat equation on a domain Ω. One might seek solutions σ ∈ X to the heat equation; for each time t , σ ( t ) is a function in the Sobolev space  H 1 (Ω). One could also think of Y = [0, T ] × H 1 (Ω), which as a Cartesian product also has the structure of a Banach bundle over the manifold [0, T ] with fibre H 1 (Ω), in which case elements/solutions σ ∈ X are cross sections of the bundle Y of some specified regularity ( L ², in fact). If the differential geometry of the problem in question is particularly relevant, the Banach bundle point of view might be advantageous.   Morphisms of Banach bundles  The collection of all Banach bundles can be made into a category by defining appropriate morphisms.  Let π : E → M and π ′ : E ′ → M ′ be two Banach bundles. A Banach bundle morphism from the first bundle to the second consists of a pair of morphisms        f  0   :   M  →   M  ′     ;     normal-:   subscript  f  0    normal-→  M   superscript  M  normal-′      f_{0}:M\to M^{\prime};          f  :   E  →   E  ′     .     normal-:  f   normal-→  E   superscript  E  normal-′      f:E\to E^{\prime}.     For f to be a morphism means simply that f is a continuous map of topological spaces. If the manifolds M and M ′ are both of class C p , then the requirement that f 0 be a morphism is the requirement that it be a p -times continuously differentiable function . These two morphisms are required to satisfy two conditions (again, the second one is redundant in the finite-dimensional case):   the diagram           commutes, and, for each x ∈ M , the induced map          f  x   :    E  x   →   E    f  0    (  x  )    ′       normal-:   subscript  f  x    normal-→   subscript  E  x    subscript   superscript  E  normal-′      subscript  f  0   x       f_{x}:E_{x}\to E^{\prime}_{f_{0}(x)}         is a continuous linear map;    for each x 0 ∈ M there exist trivialising maps         τ  :     π   -  1     (  U  )    →   U  ×  X       normal-:  τ   normal-→     superscript  π    1    U     U  X      \tau:\pi^{-1}(U)\to U\times X          τ  ′   :     π   ′   -  1      (   U  ′   )    →    U  ′   ×   X  ′        normal-:   superscript  τ  normal-′    normal-→     superscript  π   normal-′    1      superscript  U  normal-′       superscript  U  normal-′    superscript  X  normal-′       \tau^{\prime}:\pi^{\prime-1}(U^{\prime})\to U^{\prime}\times X^{\prime}         such that x 0 ∈ U , f 0 ( x 0 ) ∈ U ′,           f  0    (  U  )    ⊆   U  ′          subscript  f  0   U    superscript  U  normal-′     f_{0}(U)\subseteq U^{\prime}         and the map         U  →   Lin   (  X  ;   X  ′   )       normal-→  U    Lin   X   superscript  X  normal-′       U\to\mathrm{Lin}(X;X^{\prime})         x  ↦    τ    f  0    (  x  )    ′   ∘   f  x   ∘   τ   -  1        maps-to  x     subscript   superscript  τ  normal-′      subscript  f  0   x     subscript  f  x    superscript  τ    1       x\mapsto\tau^{\prime}_{f_{0}(x)}\circ f_{x}\circ\tau^{-1}         is a morphism (a differentiable map of class C p ).   Pull-back of a Banach bundle  One can take a Banach bundle over one manifold and use the pull-back construction to define a new Banach bundle on a second manifold.  Specifically, let π : E → N be a Banach bundle and f : M → N a differentiable map (as usual, everything is C p ). Then the pull-back of π : E → N is the Banach bundle f * π : f * E → M satisfying the following properties:   for each x ∈ M , ( f * E ) x = E f ( x ) ;    there is a commutative diagram           with the top horizontal map being the identity on each fibre;    if E is trivial, i.e. equal to N × X for some Banach space X , then f * E is also trivial and equal to M × X , and           f  *   π   :     f  *   E   =   M  ×  X   →  M      normal-:     superscript  f    π          superscript  f    E     M  X     normal-→    M      f^{*}\pi:f^{*}E=M\times X\to M         is the projection onto the first coordinate;    if V is an open subset of N and U = f −1 ( V ), then           f  *    (   E  V   )    =    (    f  *   E   )   U          superscript  f     subscript  E  V     subscript     superscript  f    E   U     f^{*}(E_{V})=(f^{*}E)_{U}         and there is a commutative diagram           where the maps at the "front" and "back" are the same as those in the previous diagram, and the maps from "back" to "front" are (induced by) the inclusions.
