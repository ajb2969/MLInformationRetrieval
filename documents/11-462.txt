   Citrate lyase deacetylase      Citrate lyase deacetylase   In enzymology , a citrate lyase deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](acetyl form) + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](thiol form) + acetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are [[[citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](acetyl form)]] and H 2 O , whereas its two products are [[[citrate (pro-3S)-lyase](thiol form)]] and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is [citrate-(pro-3S)-lyase](acetyl-form) hydrolase . This enzyme is also called [citrate-(pro-3S)-lyase] thiolesterase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
