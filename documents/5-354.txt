Lerch zeta function

In mathematics, the Lerch zeta-function, sometimes called the Hurwitz–Lerch zeta-function, is a special function that generalizes the Hurwitz zeta-function and the polylogarithm. It is named after the Czech mathematician Mathias Lerch 1.
Definition
The Lerch zeta-function is given by



A related function, the Lerch transcendent, is given by



The two are related, as



Integral representations
An integral representation is given by



for



A contour integral representation is given by



for



where the contour must not enclose any of the points 
 
 

A Hermite-like integral representation is given by



for



and



for



Special cases
The Hurwitz zeta-function is a special case, given by



The polylogarithm is a special case of the Lerch Zeta, given by



The Legendre chi function is a special case, given by



The Riemann zeta-function is given by



The Dirichlet eta-function is given by



Identities
For λ rational, the summand is a root of unity, and thus 
 
 
 
  may be expressed as a finite sum over the Hurwitz zeta-function.
Various identities include:



and



and



Series representations
A series representation for the Lerch transcendent is given by


 
  (Note that 
 
 
 
  is a binomial coefficient.)
The series is valid for all s, and for complex z with Re(z)|\log(z)|



If s is a positive integer, then


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the digamma function.
A Taylor series in the third variable is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Pochhammer symbol.
Series at a = -n is given by



A special case for n = 0 has the following series


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the polylogarithm.

Software
The Lerch transcendent is implemented as LerchPhi in Maple.
