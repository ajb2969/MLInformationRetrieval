   4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase      4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase () is an enzyme found in some bacteria and archaea that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzoyl-CoA + acceptor + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are benzoyl-CoA , acceptor , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzoyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include:   4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA reductase (dehydroxylating), and  4-hydroxybenzoyl-CoA:(acceptor) oxidoreductase.
