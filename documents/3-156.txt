   Self-ionization of water      Self-ionization of water   thumb|upright=1.5 The self-ionization of water (also autoionization of water , and autodissociation of water ) is an ionization reaction in pure water or an aqueous solution , in which a water molecule, H 2 O, deprotonates (loses the nucleus of one of its hydrogen atoms) to become a hydroxide ion, OH − . The hydrogen nucleus, H + , immediately protonates another water molecule to form hydronium , H 3 O + . It is an example of autoprotolysis , and exemplifies the amphoteric nature of water.  Equilibrium constant  Chemically pure water has an electrical conductivity of 0.055 µ S ∙cm −1 . According to the theories of Svante Arrhenius , this must be due to the presence of ions . The ions are produced by the self-ionization reaction   H 2 O + H 2 O  H 3 O + + OH −    This equilibrium applies to pure water and any aqueous solution.  Expressed with activities   a   a   a   , instead of concentrations, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the water ionization reaction is:       K  eq   =     a    H  3    O  +     ⋅   a   OH  -      a    H  2   O   2         subscript  K  eq      normal-⋅   subscript  a     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O       subscript  a   superscript  OH       superscript   subscript  a     subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O    2      K_{\rm eq}=\frac{a_{\rm{H_{3}O^{+}}}\cdot a_{\rm{OH^{-}}}}{a_{\rm{H_{2}O}}^{2}}     which is numerically equal to the more traditional thermodynamic equilibrium constant written as:       K  eq   =     a   H  +    ⋅   a   OH  -      a    H  2   O          subscript  K  eq      normal-⋅   subscript  a   superscript  normal-H      subscript  a   superscript  OH       subscript  a     subscript  normal-H  2   normal-O       K_{\rm eq}=\frac{a_{\rm{H^{+}}}\cdot a_{\rm{OH^{-}}}}{a_{\rm{H_{2}O}}}     under the assumption that the sum of the chemical potentials of H + and H 3 O + is formally equal to twice the chemical potential of H 2 O at the same temperature and pressure. 1  Because the activity of water, as the solvent in a very dilute solution, is assumed to be unity, the ionic product of water can be also expressed on an activity basis as: 2       K  eq   =    a    H  3    O  +     ⋅   a   OH  -          subscript  K  eq    normal-⋅   subscript  a     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O       subscript  a   superscript  OH        K_{\rm eq}=a_{\rm{H_{3}O^{+}}}\cdot a_{\rm{OH^{-}}}     In dilute aqueous solutions, the activities of the solute particles are essentially equal to their concentrations. Thus, the ionization constant , dissociation constant , self-ionization constant , or ionic product of water, symbolized by K w , may be given by:       K  w   =    [    H  3    O  +    ]    [   OH  -   ]         subscript  K  normal-w      delimited-[]     subscript  normal-H  3    superscript  normal-O       delimited-[]   superscript  OH        K_{\rm w}=[{\rm{H_{3}O^{+}}}][{\rm{OH^{-}}}]   where [H 3 O + ] is the concentration of hydrogen or hydronium ion , and [OH − ] is the concentration of hydroxide ion.  At 25 °C K w is equal to  (mol/L) 2 . Note that the units are concentration squared.  We can also define     p   K  w    =   -    log  10    K  w     =  14          normal-p   subscript  K  normal-w        subscript   10    subscript  K  normal-w          14     \mathrm{p}K_{\rm w}=-\log_{10}K_{\rm w}=14   at 25 °C. This is analogous to the notations pH and p K a for an acid dissociation constant , where the symbol p denotes a cologarithm . The logarithmic form of the equilibrium constant equation is     p   K  w    =   pH  +  pOH         normal-p   subscript  K  normal-w      pH  pOH     \mathrm{p}K_{\rm w}=\mathrm{pH}+\mathrm{pOH}   .  Dependence on temperature, pressure and ionic strength     (Figure)  Temperature dependence of the water ionization constant at 25 MPa   (Figure)  Pressure dependence of the water ionization constant at 25 °C   (Figure)  Variation of p K w with ionic strength of NaCl solutions at 25 °C      The dependence of the water ionization on temperature and pressure has been investigated thoroughly. 3 The value of p K w decreases as temperature increases from the melting point of ice to a minimum at c. 250 °C, after which it increases up to the critical point of water c. 374 °C. It decreases with increasing pressure.      p K w values for liquid water. 4     Temperature     0 °C     25 °C     50 °C     75 °C     100 °C     150 °C     200 °C     250 °C     300 °C     350 °C     With electrolyte solutions, the value of p K w is dependent on ionic strength of the electrolyte. Values for sodium chloride are typical for a 1:1 electrolyte. With 1:2 electrolytes, MX 2 , p K w decreases with increasing ionic strength. 5  The value of K w is usually of interest in the liquid phase .

Isotope effects  Heavy water , D 2 O, self-ionizes less than normal water, H 2 O;   D 2 O + D 2 O  D 3 O + + OD −    This is attributed to oxygen forming a slightly stronger bond to deuterium because the larger mass of deuterium results in a lower zero-point energy , a quantum mechanical effect analogous to the kinetic isotope effect .  Expressed with activities   a   a   a   , instead of concentrations, the thermodynamic equilibrium constant for the heavy water ionization reaction is:       K  eq   =     a    D  3    O  +     ⋅   a   OD  -      a    D  2   O   2         subscript  K  eq      normal-⋅   subscript  a     subscript  normal-D  3    superscript  normal-O       subscript  a   superscript  OD       superscript   subscript  a     subscript  normal-D  2   normal-O    2      K_{\rm eq}=\frac{a_{\rm{D_{3}O^{+}}}\cdot a_{\rm{OD^{-}}}}{a_{\rm{D_{2}O}}^{2}}     Assuming the activity of the D 2 O to be 1, and assuming that the activities of the D 3 O + and OD − are closely approximated by their concentrations       K  w   =    [    D  3    O  +    ]    [   OD  -   ]         subscript  K  normal-w      delimited-[]     subscript  normal-D  3    superscript  normal-O       delimited-[]   superscript  OD        K_{\rm w}=[{\rm{D_{3}O^{+}}}][{\rm{OD^{-}}}]   The following table compares the values of p K w for H 2 O and D 2 O. 7        p K w values for pure water     T/°C     H 2 O     D 2 O       Ionization equilibria in water - heavy water mixtures  In water - heavy water mixtures equilibria several species are involved:H 2 O, HDO, D 2 O, H 3 O + , D 3 O + , H 2 D  O + , HD 2 O + , HO − , DO − .  Mechanism  The rate of reaction for the ionization   2 H 2 O → H 3 O + + OH −    depends on the activation energy , ΔE ‡ . According to the Boltzmann distribution the proportion of water molecules that have sufficient energy, due to thermal population, is given by       N   N  0    =   e   -    Δ   E  ‡     k  T            N   subscript  N  0     superscript  e        normal-Δ   superscript  E  normal-‡      k  T        \frac{N}{N_{0}}=e^{-\frac{\Delta E^{\ddagger}}{kT}}   where   k   k   k   is the Boltzmann constant . Thus some dissociation can occur because sufficient thermal energy is available. The following sequence of events has been proposed on the basis of electric field fluctuations in liquid water. 8 Random fluctuations in molecular motions occasionally (about once every 10 hours per water molecule 9 ) produce an electric field strong enough to break an oxygen–hydrogen bond , resulting in a hydroxide (OH − ) and hydronium ion (H 3 O + ); the hydrogen nucleus of the hydronium ion travels along water molecules by the Grotthuss mechanism and a change in the hydrogen bond network in the solvent isolates the two ions, which are stabilized by solvation. Within 1 picosecond , however, a second reorganization of the hydrogen bond network allows rapid proton transfer down the electric potential difference and subsequent recombination of the ions. This timescale is consistent with the time it takes for hydrogen bonds to reorientate themselves in water. 10 11 12  The inverse recombination reaction   H 3 O + + OH − → 2 H 2 O   is among the fastest chemical reactions known, with a reaction rate constant of 1.3 x 10 11 M −1 s −1 at room temperature. Such a rapid rate is characteristic of a diffusion-controlled reaction , in which the rate is limited by the speed of molecular diffusion . 13  Relationship with the neutral point of water  Water molecules dissociate into equal amounts of H 3 O + and OH − , so their concentrations are equal to at 25 °C. A solution in which the H 3 O + and OH − concentrations equal each other is considered a neutral solution. In general, the pH of the neutral point is numerically equal to p K w /2.  Pure water is neutral, but most water samples contain impurities. If an impurity is an acid or base , this will affect the concentrations of hydronium ion and hydroxide ion. Water samples which are exposed to air will absorb the acid carbon dioxide and the concentration of H 3 O + will increase. The concentration of OH − will decrease in such a way that the product [H 3 O + ][OH − ] remains constant for fixed temperature and pressure. Thus these water samples will be slightly acidic.
