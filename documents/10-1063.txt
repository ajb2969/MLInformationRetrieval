Ecdysone 20-monooxygenase

In enzymology, an ecdysone 20-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ecdysone + AH2 + O2

 
  20-hydroxyecdysone + A + H2O
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ecdysone, an electron acceptor AH2, and O2, whereas its 3 products are 20-hydroxyecdysone, the reduction product A, and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is Ecdysone,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (20-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include alpha-ecdysone C-20 hydroxylase, and ecdysone 20-hydroxylase.
