   Methylene-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase      Methylene-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase   In enzymology , a methylene-fatty-acyl-phospholipid synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + phospholipid olefinic fatty acid   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + phospholipid methylene fatty acid   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and phospholipid olefinic fatty acid , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and phospholipid methylene fatty acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:unsaturated-phospholipid methyltransferase (methenylating) . This enzyme is also called unsaturated-phospholipid methyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
