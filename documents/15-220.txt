   Krull–Akizuki theorem      Krull–Akizuki theorem   In algebra, the Krull–Akizuki theorem states the following: let A be a one-dimensional reduced noetherian ring, 1  K its total ring of fractions . If B is a subring of a finite extension L of K containing A and is not a field, then B is a one-dimensional noetherian ring. Furthermore, for every nonzero ideal I of B ,    B  /  I      B  I    B/I   is finite over A . 2  Note that the theorem does not say that B is finite over A . The theorem does not extend to higher dimension. One important consequence of the theorem is that the integral closure of a Dedekind domain  A in a finite extension of the field of fractions of A is again a Dedekind domain. This consequence does generalize to a higher dimension: the Mori–Nagata theorem states that the integral closure of a noetherian domain is a Krull domain .  Proof  Here, we give a proof when    L  =  K      L  K    L=K   . Let    𝔭  i     subscript  𝔭  i    \mathfrak{p}_{i}   be minimal prime ideals of A ; there are finitely many of them. Let    K  i     subscript  K  i    K_{i}   be the field of fractions of    A  /   𝔭  i       A   subscript  𝔭  i     A/{\mathfrak{p}_{i}}   and    I  i     subscript  I  i    I_{i}   the kernel of the natural map    B  →  K  →   K  i        normal-→  B  K    normal-→     subscript  K  i      B\to K\to K_{i}   . Then we have:       A  /   𝔭  i    ⊂   B  /   I  i    ⊂   K  i           A   subscript  𝔭  i      B   subscript  I  i          subscript  K  i      A/{\mathfrak{p}_{i}}\subset B/{I_{i}}\subset K_{i}   . Now, if the theorem holds when A is a domain, then this implies that B is a one-dimensional noetherian domain since each    B  /   I  i       B   subscript  I  i     B/{I_{i}}   is and since    B  =   ∏   B  /   I  i         B   product    B   subscript  I  i       B=\prod B/{I_{i}}   . Hence, we reduced the proof to the case A is a domain. Let    0  ≠  I  ⊂  B        0  I       B     0\neq I\subset B   be an ideal and let a be a nonzero element in the nonzero ideal    I  ∩  A      I  A    I\cap A   . Set     I  n   =      a  n   B   ∩  A   +   a  A         subscript  I  n          superscript  a  n   B   A     a  A      I_{n}=a^{n}B\cap A+aA   . Since     A  /  a   A        A  a   A    A/aA   is a zero-dim noetherian ring; thus, artinian , there is an l such that     I  n   =   I  l        subscript  I  n    subscript  I  l     I_{n}=I_{l}   for all    n  ≥  l      n  l    n\geq l   . We claim         a  l   B   ⊂     a   l  +  1    B   +  A    .         superscript  a  l   B        superscript  a    l  1    B   A     a^{l}B\subset a^{l+1}B+A.   Since it suffices to establish the inclusion locally, we may assume A is a local ring with the maximal ideal   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   . Let x be a nonzero element in B . Then, since A is noetherian, there is an n such that     𝔪   n  +  1    ⊂    x   -  1    A        superscript  𝔪    n  1       superscript  x    1    A     \mathfrak{m}^{n+1}\subset x^{-1}A   and so      a   n  +  1    x   ∈     a   n  +  1    B   ∩  A   ⊂   I   n  +  2             superscript  a    n  1    x        superscript  a    n  1    B   A         subscript  I    n  2       a^{n+1}x\in a^{n+1}B\cap A\subset I_{n+2}   . Thus,         a  n   x   ∈      a   n  +  1    B   ∩  A   +  A    .         superscript  a  n   x          superscript  a    n  1    B   A   A     a^{n}x\in a^{n+1}B\cap A+A.   Now, assume n is a minimum integer such that    n  ≥  l      n  l    n\geq l   and the last inclusion holds. If    n  >  l      n  l    n>l   , then we easily see that      a  n   x   ∈   I   n  +  1           superscript  a  n   x    subscript  I    n  1      a^{n}x\in I_{n+1}   . But then the above inclusion holds for    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   , contradiction. Hence, we have    n  =  l      n  l    n=l   and this establishes the claim. It now follows:         B  /  a   B   ≃      a  l   B   /   a   l  +  1     B   ⊂     (     a   l  +  1    B   +  A   )   /   a   l  +  1     B   ≃     A  /   a   l  +  1     B   ∩  A    .       similar-to-or-equals      B  a   B          superscript  a  l   B    superscript  a    l  1     B                 superscript  a    l  1    B   A    superscript  a    l  1     B     similar-to-or-equals          A   superscript  a    l  1     B   A      B/{aB}\simeq a^{l}B/a^{l+1}B\subset(a^{l+1}B+A)/a^{l+1}B\simeq A/{a^{l+1}B\cap
 A}.   Hence,     B  /  a   B        B  a   B    B/{aB}   has finite length as A -module. In particular, the image of I there is finitely generated and so I is finitely generated. Finally, the above shows that     B  /  a   B        B  a   B    B/{aB}   has zero dimension and so B has dimension one.   □   normal-□   \square     References   http://books.google.com/books?id=APPtnn84FMIC&lpg; ;=PA83&ots;=2L9MiWbIYZ&dq;=krull%20akizuki&pg;=PA85#v=onepage&q;=krull%20akizuki&f;=false  Nicolas Bourbaki , Commutative algebra   "  Category:Theorems in algebra     In this article, a ring is commutative and has unity. ↩  ↩
