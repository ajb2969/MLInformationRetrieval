   Sterigmatocystin 8-O-methyltransferase      Sterigmatocystin 8-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a sterigmatocystin 8-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + sterigmatocystin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 8-O-methylsterigmatocystin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and sterigmatocystin , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 8-O-methylsterigmatocystin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:sterigmatocystin 8-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include sterigmatocystin methyltransferase , O-methyltransferase II , sterigmatocystin 7-O-methyltransferase (incorrect) , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:sterigmatocystin 7-O-methyltransferase , and (incorrect) .
