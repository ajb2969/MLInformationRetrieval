   Mazur–Ulam theorem      Mazur–Ulam theorem   In mathematics, the Mazur–Ulam theorem states that if   V   V   V   and   W   W   W   are normed spaces over R and the mapping      f  :   V  →  W      normal-:  f   normal-→  V  W     f\colon V\to W     is a surjective isometry , then   f   f   f   is affine .
