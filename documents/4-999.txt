Schreier's lemma

In mathematics, Schreier's lemma is a theorem in group theory used in the Schreier–Sims algorithm and also for finding a presentation of a subgroup.
Definition
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 , which is finitely generated with generating set 
 
 
 
 , that is, G = 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a right transversal of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . In other words, 
 
 
 
  is (the image of) a section of the quotient map 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the set of right cosets of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
We make the definition that given 
 
 
 
 ∈
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the chosen representative in the transversal 
 
 
 
  of the coset 
 
 
 
 , that is,



Then 
 
 
 
  is generated by the set



Example
Let us establish the evident fact that the group Z3 = Z/3Z is indeed cyclic. Via Cayley's theorem, Z3 is a subgroup of the symmetric group S3. Now,





 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the identity permutation. Note S3 = 
 
 
 
 { s1=(1 2), s2 = (1 2 3) }
 
 
 
 .
Z3 has just two cosets, Z3 and S3 \ Z3, so we select the transversal { t1 = e, t2=(1 2) }, and we have



Finally,












Thus, by Schreier's subgroup lemma, { e, (1 2 3) } generates Z3, but having the identity in the generating set is redundant, so we can remove it to obtain another generating set for Z3, { (1 2 3) } (as expected).
