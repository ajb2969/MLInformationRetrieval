   Center (group theory)      Center (group theory)   In abstract algebra , the center of a group  G , denoted Z ( G ), 1 is the set of elements that commute with every element of G . In set-builder notation ,        Z   (  G  )    =   {   z  ∈  G   ∣     ∀  g   ∈  G   ,    z  g   =   g  z     }    .        Z  G    conditional-set    z  G    formulae-sequence     for-all  g   G       z  g     g  z        Z(G)=\{z\in G\mid\forall g\in G,zg=gz\}.     The center is a subgroup of G , which by definition is abelian (that is, commutative). As a subgroup, it is always normal , and indeed characteristic , but it need not be fully characteristic . The quotient group  G / Z ( G ) is isomorphic to the group of inner automorphisms of G .  A group G is abelian if and only if Z ( G ) = G . At the other extreme, a group is said to be centerless if Z ( G ) is trivial , i.e. consists only of the identity element .  The elements of the center are sometimes called central .  As a subgroup  The center of G is always a subgroup of G . In particular:   Z ( G ) contains e , the identity element of G , because eg = g = ge for all g ∈ G by definition of e , so by definition of Z ( G ), e ∈ Z ( G );  If x and y are in Z ( G ), then ( xy ) g = x ( yg ) = x ( gy ) = ( xg ) y = ( gx ) y = g ( xy ) for each g ∈ G , and so xy is in Z ( G ) as well (i.e., Z ( G ) exhibits closure);  If x is in Z ( G ), then gx = xg , and multiplying twice, once on the left and once on the right, by x −1 , gives x −1 g = gx −1 — so x −1 ∈ Z ( G ).   Furthermore the center of G is always a normal subgroup of G , as it is closed under conjugation .  Conjugacy classes and centralisers  By definition, the center is the set of elements for which the conjugacy class of each element is the element itself, i.e. ccl(g) = {g}.  The center is also the intersection of all the centralizers of each element of G. As centralizers are subgroups, this again shows that the center is a subgroup.  Conjugation  Consider the map f : G → Aut( G ) from G to the automorphism group of G defined by f ( g ) = ϕ g , where ϕ g is the automorphism of G defined by         ϕ  g    (  h  )    =   g  h   g   -  1      .         subscript  ϕ  g   h     g  h   superscript  g    1       \phi_{g}(h)=ghg^{-1}.\,     The function f is a group homomorphism , and its kernel is precisely the center of G , and its image is called the inner automorphism group of G , denoted Inn( G ). By the first isomorphism theorem we get         G  /  Z    (  G  )    ≅   Inn   (  G  )     .          G  Z   G     Inn  normal-G     G/Z(G)\cong\rm{Inn}(G).     The cokernel of this map is the group    Out   (  G  )      Out  G    \operatorname{Out}(G)   of outer automorphisms , and these form the exact sequence      1  →   Z   (  G  )    →  G  →   Aut   (  G  )    →   Out   (  G  )    →  1.       normal-→  1    Z  G     normal-→    G    normal-→     Aut  G     normal-→     Out  G     normal-→    1.     1\to Z(G)\to G\to\operatorname{Aut}(G)\to\operatorname{Out}(G)\to 1.     Examples   The center of an abelian group  G is all of G .  The center of the Heisenberg group  G are all matrices of the form : \begin{pmatrix}   1 & 0 & z\\  0 & 1 & 0\\  0 & 0 & 1  \end{pmatrix}   The center of a nonabelian  simple group is trivial.  The center of the dihedral group D n is trivial when n is odd. When n is even, the center consists of the identity element together with the 180° rotation of the polygon .  The center of the quaternion group      Q  8   =   {  1  ,   -  1   ,  i  ,   -  i   ,  j  ,   -  j   ,  k  ,   -  k   }        subscript  Q  8    1    1   i    i   j    j   k    k      Q_{8}=\{1,-1,i,-i,j,-j,k,-k\}   is    {  1  ,   -  1   }     1    1     \{1,-1\}   .  The center of the symmetric group  S n is trivial for n ≥ 3.  The center of the alternating group  A n is trivial for n ≥ 4.  The center of the general linear group      GL  n    (  F  )        subscript  GL  n   F    \mathrm{GL}_{n}(F)   is the collection of scalar matrices     {   s   I  n    |   s  ∈   F  ∖   {  0  }     }     conditional-set    s   subscript  I  n      s    F   0       \{sI_{n}|s\in F\setminus\{0\}\}   .  The center of the orthogonal group     O   (  n  ,  F  )       O   n  F     O(n,F)   is    {   I  n   ,   -   I  n    }      subscript  I  n      subscript  I  n      \{I_{n},-I_{n}\}   .  The center of the multiplicative group of non-zero quaternions is the multiplicative group of non-zero real numbers.  Using the class equation one can prove that the center of any non-trivial finite  p-group is non-trivial.  If the quotient group      G  /  Z    (  G  )         G  Z   G    G/Z(G)   is cyclic , G is abelian (and so G = Z ( G ), and     G  /  Z    (  G  )         G  Z   G    G/Z(G)   is trivial).  The quotient group      G  /  Z    (  G  )         G  Z   G    G/Z(G)   is not isomorphic to the quaternion group     Q  8     subscript  Q  8    Q_{8}   .   Higher centers  Quotienting out by the center of a group yields a sequence of groups called the upper central series :       G  0   =  G  →   G  1   =     G  0   /  Z    (   G  0   )    →   G  2   =     G  1   /  Z    (   G  1   )    →  ⋯         subscript  G  0   G    normal-→     subscript  G  1             subscript  G  0   Z    subscript  G  0      normal-→     subscript  G  2             subscript  G  1   Z    subscript  G  1      normal-→    normal-⋯     G_{0}=G\to G_{1}=G_{0}/Z(G_{0})\to G_{2}=G_{1}/Z(G_{1})\to\cdots     The kernel of the map    G  →   G  i      normal-→  G   subscript  G  i     G\to G_{i}   is the i th center of G ( second center , third center , etc.), and is denoted      Z  i    (  G  )    .       superscript  Z  i   G    Z^{i}(G).   Concretely, the    (   i  +  1   )      i  1    (i+1)   -st center are the terms that commute with all elements up to an element of the i th center. Following this definition, one can define the 0th center of a group to be the identity subgroup. This can be continued to transfinite ordinals by transfinite induction ; the union of all the higher centers is called the hypercenter . 2  The ascending chain of subgroups      1  ≤   Z   (  G  )    ≤    Z  2    (  G  )    ≤  ⋯        1    Z  G           superscript  Z  2   G        normal-⋯     1\leq Z(G)\leq Z^{2}(G)\leq\cdots     stabilizes at i (equivalently,      Z  i    (  G  )    =    Z   i  +  1     (  G  )           superscript  Z  i   G      superscript  Z    i  1    G     Z^{i}(G)=Z^{i+1}(G)   ) if and only if     G  i     subscript  G  i    G_{i}   is centerless.  Examples   For a centerless group, all higher centers are zero, which is the case      Z  0    (  G  )    =    Z  1    (  G  )           superscript  Z  0   G      superscript  Z  1   G     Z^{0}(G)=Z^{1}(G)   of stabilization.  By Grün's lemma , the quotient of a perfect group by its center is centerless, hence all higher centers equal the center. This is a case of stabilization at      Z  1    (  G  )    =    Z  2    (  G  )           superscript  Z  1   G      superscript  Z  2   G     Z^{1}(G)=Z^{2}(G)   .
