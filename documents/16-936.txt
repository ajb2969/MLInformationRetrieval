Montesinos link

 In the mathematical theory of knots, a Montesinos link is a special kind of link that generalizes pretzel links. A Montesinos link which is also a knot (i.e. a link with one component) is a Montesinos knot.
Notation
A Montesinos link is composed of several rational tangles. One notation for a Montesinos link is 
 
 
 
 .1
In this notation, 
 
 
 
  and all the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are integers. The Montesinos link given by this notation consists of the sum of the rational tangles given by the integer 
 
 
 
  and the rational tangles 
 
 

A pretzel link can also be described as a Montesinos link with integer tangles.
