   Montesinos link      Montesinos link   In the mathematical theory of knots , a Montesinos link is a special kind of link that generalizes pretzel links . A Montesinos link which is also a knot (i.e. a link with one component) is a Montesinos knot .  Notation  A Montesinos link is composed of several rational tangles . One notation for a Montesinos link is    K   (  e  ;    α  1   /   β  1    ,    α  2   /   β  2    ,  …  ,    α  n   /   β  n    )       K   e     subscript  α  1    subscript  β  1       subscript  α  2    subscript  β  2    normal-…     subscript  α  n    subscript  β  n       K(e;\alpha_{1}/\beta_{1},\alpha_{2}/\beta_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{n}/\beta_{n})   . 1  In this notation,   e   e   e   and all the    α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   and    β  i     subscript  β  i    \beta_{i}   are integers. The Montesinos link given by this notation consists of the sum of the rational tangles given by the integer   e   e   e   and the rational tangles      α  1   /   β  1    ,    α  2   /   β  2    ,  …  ,    α  n   /   β  n          subscript  α  1    subscript  β  1       subscript  α  2    subscript  β  2    normal-…     subscript  α  n    subscript  β  n      \alpha_{1}/\beta_{1},\alpha_{2}/\beta_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{n}/\beta_{n}     A pretzel link can also be described as a Montesinos link with integer tangles.
