   Group action      Group action   In mathematics , a symmetry group describes all symmetries of objects. This is formalized by the notion of a group action : every element of the group "acts" like a bijective map (or "symmetry") on some set. In this case, the group is also called a permutation group (especially if the set is finite or not a vector space) or transformation group (especially if the set is a vector space and the group acts like linear transformations of the set). A permutation representation of a group G is a representation of G as a group of permutations of the set (usually if the set is finite), and may be described as a group representation of G by permutation matrices . It is the same as a group action of G on an ordered  basis of a vector space .  A group action is an extension to the notion of a symmetry group in which every element of the group "acts" like a bijective transformation (or "symmetry") of some set, without being identified with that transformation. This allows for a more comprehensive description of the symmetries of an object, such as a polyhedron , by allowing the same group to act on several different sets of features, such as the set of vertices , the set of edges and the set of faces of the polyhedron.  If G is a group and X is a set, then a group action may be defined as a group homomorphism  h from G to the symmetric group on X . The action assigns a permutation of X to each element of the group in such a way that the permutation of X assigned to   the identity element of G is the identity transformation of X ;  a product gk of two elements of G is the composition of the permutations assigned to g and k .   The abstraction provided by group actions is a powerful one, because it allows geometrical ideas to be applied to more abstract objects. Many objects in mathematics have natural group actions defined on them. In particular, groups can act on other groups, or even on themselves. Despite this generality, the theory of group actions contains wide-reaching theorems , such as the orbit stabilizer theorem, which can be used to prove deep results in several fields.  Definition  If G is a group and X is a set, then a ( left ) group action  œÜ of G on X is a function      œÜ  :    G  √ó  X   ‚Üí  X   :    (  g  ,  x  )   ‚Ü¶   œÜ   (  g  ,  x  )          normal-:  œÜ   normal-‚Üí    G  X   X     normal-:     maps-to   g  x     œÜ   g  x        \varphi:G\times X\to X:(g,x)\mapsto\varphi(g,x)   that satisfies the following two axioms (where we denote œÜ ( g , x ) as g . x ): 1   Compatibility:  for all g , h in G and all x in X . (Here, gh denotes the result of applying the group operation of G to the elements g and h .) Identity:  for all x in X . (Here, e denotes the neutral element of the group G .)   The set X is called a ( left ) G-set . The group G is said to act on X (on the left).  From these two axioms, it follows that for every g in G , the function which maps x in X to g . x is a bijective map from X to X (its inverse being the function which maps x to g ‚àí1 . x ). Therefore, one may alternatively define a group action of G on X as a group homomorphism from G into the symmetric group Sym( X ) of all bijections from X to X . 2  In complete analogy, one can define a right group action of G on X as an operation  mapping  to x . g and satisfying the two axioms:   Compatibility:  for all g , h in G and all x in X ; Identity:  for all x in X .   The difference between left and right actions is in the order in which a product like gh acts on x . For a left action h acts first and is followed by g , while for a right action g acts first and is followed by h . Because of the formula , one can construct a left action from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group G on X is the same thing as a left action of its opposite group  G op on X . It is thus sufficient to only consider left actions without any loss of generality.  Examples   The action of any group G on any set X is defined by  for all g in G and all x in X ; that is, every group element induces the identity permutation on X . 3  In every group G , left multiplication is an action of G on G :  for all g , x in G .  In every group G , conjugation is an action of G on G : . An exponential notation is commonly used for the right-action variant: ; it satisfies ( .  The symmetric group S n and its subgroups act on the set  by permuting its elements  The symmetry group of a polyhedron acts on the set of vertices of that polyhedron. It also acts on the set of faces or the set of edges of the polyhedron.  The symmetry group of any geometrical object acts on the set of points of that object.  The automorphism group of a vector space (or graph , or group, or ring ‚Ä¶) acts on the vector space (or set of vertices of the graph, or group, or ring‚Ä¶).  The general linear group and its subgroups, particularly its Lie subgroups (including the special linear group , orthogonal group , special orthogonal group , and symplectic group ) are Lie groups that act on the vector space  K n . The group operations are given by multiplying the matrices from the groups with the vectors from K n .  The affine group acts transitively and faithfully on the points of an affine space . This is in fact one way to define an affine space, i.e. saying that    œÜ  :    V  √ó  A   ‚Üí  A   :    (  v  ,  t  )   ‚Ü¶   v  +  t         normal-:  œÜ   normal-‚Üí    V  A   A     normal-:     maps-to   v  t     v  t       \varphi:V\times A\to A:(v,t)\mapsto v+t   is a transitive and faithful action is equivalent to the formal definition of an affine space : (left) identity and associativity are equivalent to the definition of a (left) action and uniqueness is equivalent to the property of the action of being transitive and faithful.  The projective linear group and its subgroups, particularly its Lie subgroups, which are Lie groups that act on the projective space  P n ( K ). This is a quotient of the action of the general linear group on projective space. Particularly notable is , the symmetries of the projective line, which is sharply 3-transitive, preserving the cross ratio ; the M√∂bius group is of particular interest.  The isometries of the plane act on the set of 2D images and patterns, such as wallpaper patterns . The definition can be made more precise by specifying what is meant by image or pattern; e.g., a function of position with values in a set of colors. Isometries are in fact one example of affine group (action).  The sets acted on by a group G comprise the category of G-sets in which the objects are G-sets and the morphisms are G-set homomorphisms: functions  such that  for every g in G .  The Galois group of a field extension  L / K acts on the field L but has only a trivial action on elements of the subfield K. Subgroups of Gal(L/K) correspond to subfields of L that contain K, i.e. intermediate field extensions between L and K.  The additive group of the real numbers acts on the phase space of " well-behaved " systems in classical mechanics (and in more general dynamical systems ) by time translation: if t is in R and x is in the phase space, then x describes a state of the system, and t + x is defined to be the state of the system t seconds later if t is positive or ‚àí t seconds ago if t is negative.  The additive group of the real numbers  acts on the set of real functions of a real variable in various ways, with ( t . f )( x ) equal to e.g. , , , , , or , but not .  Given a group action of G on X , we can define an induced action of G on the power set of X , by setting  for every subset U of X and every g in G . This is useful, for instance, in studying the action of the large Mathieu group on a 24-set and in studying symmetry in certain models of finite geometries .  The quaternions with norm 1 (the versors ), as a multiplicative group, act on R 3 : for any such quaternion    z  =    cos     1  2    Œ±    +   sin     1  2    Œ±   ùêØ  ^          z          1  2   Œ±          1  2   Œ±   normal-^  ùêØ        \scriptstyle z=\cos\frac{1}{2}\alpha+\sin\frac{1}{2}\alpha\hat{\mathbf{v}}   , the mapping is a counterclockwise rotation through an angle Œ± about an axis v ; z is the same rotation; see quaternions and spatial rotation .   Types of actions  The action of G on X is called   if X is non-empty and if for any x , y in X there exists a g in G such that .  (or ) if for any two distinct g , h in G there exists an x in X such that ; or equivalently, if for any  in G there exists an x in X such that . Intuitively, in a faithful group action, different elements of G induce different permutations of X .  (or semiregular or fixed point free ) if, given g , h in G , the existence of an x in X with  implies . Equivalently: if g is a group element and there exists an x in X with  (that is, if g has at least one fixed point), then g is the identity.  (or or sharply transitive ) if it is both transitive and free; this is equivalent to saying that for any two x , y in X there exists precisely one g in G such that . In this case, X is known as a principal homogeneous space for G or as a G -torsor.  if X has at least n elements and for any pairwise distinct x 1 , ‚Ä¶, x n and pairwise distinct y 1 , ‚Ä¶, y n there is a g in G such that for . A 2-transitive action is also called , a 3-transitive action is also called triply transitive , and so on. Such actions define 2-transitive groups , 3-transitive groups , and multiply transitive groups .  if there is exactly one such g .   if it is transitive and preserves no non-trivial partition of X . See primitive permutation group for details.  Locally free if G is a topological group , and there is a neighbourhood  U of e in G such that the restriction of the action to U is free; that is, if  for some x and some g in U then .  Irreducible if X is a non-zero module over a ring R , the action of G is R -linear, and there is no nonzero proper invariant submodule.   Every free action on a non-empty set is faithful. A group G acts faithfully on X  if and only if the corresponding homomorphism  has a trivial kernel . Thus, for a faithful action, G embeds into to a permutation group on X ; specifically, G is isomorphic to its image in Sym( X ).  The action of any group G on itself by left multiplication is regular, and thus faithful as well. Every group can, therefore, be embedded in the symmetric group on its own elements, Sym( G ). This result is known as Cayley's theorem .  If G does not act faithfully on X , one can easily modify the group to obtain a faithful action. If we define , then N is a normal subgroup of G ; indeed, it is the kernel of the homomorphism . The factor group  G / N acts faithfully on X by setting . The original action of G on X is faithful if and only if .  Orbits and stabilizers  (Figure)  In the compound of five tetrahedra , the symmetry group is the (rotational) icosahedral group  I of order 60, while the stabilizer of a single chosen tetrahedron is the (rotational) tetrahedral group  T of order 12, and the orbit space I / T (of order 60/12¬†=¬†5) is naturally identified with the 5 tetrahedra ‚Äì the coset gT corresponds to which tetrahedron g sends the chosen tetrahedron to.   Consider a group G acting on a set X . The orbit of a point x in X is the set of elements of X to which x can be moved by the elements of G . The orbit of x is denoted by G . x :      G  .  x  =   {  g  .  x  ‚à£  g  ‚àà  G  }   .     fragments  G  normal-.  x    fragments  normal-{  g  normal-.  x  normal-‚à£  g   G  normal-}   normal-.    G.x=\left\{g.x\mid g\in G\right\}.     The defining properties of a group guarantee that the set of orbits of (points x in) X under the action of G form a partition of X . The associated equivalence relation is defined by saying if and only if there exists a g in G with . The orbits are then the equivalence classes under this relation; two elements x and y are equivalent if and only if their orbits are the same; i.e., .  The group action is transitive if and only if it has only one orbit, i.e. if there exists x in X with . This is the case if and only if  for all  x in X .  The set of all orbits of X under the action of G is written as X / G (or, less frequently: G \ X ), and is called the quotient of the action. In geometric situations it may be called the , while in algebraic situations it may be called the space of , and written X G , by contrast with the invariants (fixed points), denoted X G : the coinvariants are a quotient while the invariants are a subset. The coinvariant terminology and notation are used particularly in group cohomology and group homology , which use the same superscript/subscript convention.  Invariant subsets  If Y is a subset of X , we write GY for the set . We call the subset Y  invariant under G if  (which is equivalent to ). In that case, G also operates on Y by restricting the action to Y . The subset Y is called fixed under G if  for all g in G and all y in Y . Every subset that is fixed under G is also invariant under G , but not vice versa.  Every orbit is an invariant subset of X on which G acts transitively . The action of G on X is transitive if and only if all elements are equivalent, meaning that there is only one orbit.  A G-invariant element of X is  such that  for all . The set of all such x is denoted X G and called the G-invariants of X . When X is a G -module , X G is the zeroth group cohomology group of G with coefficients in X , and the higher cohomology groups are the derived functors of the functor of G -invariants.  Fixed points and stabilizer subgroups  Given g in G and x in X with , we say x is a fixed point of g and g fixes x .  For every x in X , we define the stabilizer subgroup of G with respect to x (also called the isotropy group ) as the set of all elements in G that fix x :        G  x   =   {   g  ‚àà  G   ‚à£   g  .   x  =  x    }    .       subscript  G  x    conditional-set    g  G    formulae-sequence  g    x  x       G_{x}=\{g\in G\mid g.x=x\}.   This is a subgroup of G , though typically not a normal one. The action of G on X is free if and only if all stabilizers are trivial. The kernel N of the homomorphism  is given by the intersection of the stabilizers G x for all x in X . If N is trivial, the action is said to be faithful (or effective).  Let x and y be two elements in X , and let g be a group element such that . Then the two stabilizer groups G x and G y are related by . Proof: by definition, if and only if . Applying g ‚àí1 to both sides of this equality yields ; that is, .  The above says that the stabilizers of elements in the same orbit are conjugate to each other. Thus, to each orbit, one can associate a conjugacy class of a subgroup of G (i.e., the set of all conjugates of the subgroup). Let    (  H  )    H   (H)   denote the conjugacy class of H . Then one says that the orbit O has type    (  H  )    H   (H)   if the stabilizer    G  x     subscript  G  x    G_{x}   of some/any x in O belongs to    (  H  )    H   (H)   . A maximal orbit type is often called a principal orbit type .  Orbit-stabilizer theorem and Burnside's lemma  Orbits and stabilizers are closely related. For a fixed x in X , consider the map from G to X given by  for all . The image of this map is the orbit of x and the coimage is the set of all left cosets of G x . The standard quotient theorem of set theory then gives a natural bijection between G / G x and G . x . Specifically, the bijection is given by hG x ‚Ü¶ h . x . This result is known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem . From a more categorical perspective, the orbit-stabilizer theorem comes from the fact that every G -set is a sum of quotients of the G -set G .  If G and X are finite then the orbit-stabilizer theorem, together with Lagrange's theorem , gives      |  G  .  x  |  =   [   G   :   G  x   ]   =  |  G  |  /  |   G  x   |  .     fragments  normal-|  G  normal-.  x  normal-|    fragments  normal-[  G  normal-:   subscript  G  x   normal-]    normal-|  G  normal-|   normal-|   subscript  G  x   normal-|  normal-.    |G.x|=[G\,:\,G_{x}]=|G|/|G_{x}|.     This result is especially useful since it can be employed for counting arguments.  A result closely related to the orbit-stabilizer theorem is Burnside's lemma :       |   X  /  G   |   =    1   |  G  |      ‚àë   g  ‚àà  G     |   X  g   |             X  G        1    G      subscript     g  G       superscript  X  g        \left|X/G\right|=\frac{1}{\left|G\right|}\sum_{g\in G}\left|X^{g}\right|     where X g is the set of points fixed by g . This result is mainly of use when G and X are finite, when it can be interpreted as follows: the number of orbits is equal to the average number of points fixed per group element.  Fixing a group G , the set of formal differences of finite G -sets forms a ring called the Burnside ring of G , where addition corresponds to disjoint union , and multiplication to Cartesian product .  Group actions and groupoids  The notion of group action can be put in a broader context by using the action groupoid       G  ‚Ä≤    =    G   ‚ãâ  X        superscript  G  normal-‚Ä≤    left-normal-factor-semidirect-product  G  X     \scriptstyle G^{\prime}\;=\;G\,\ltimes\,X   associated to the group action, thus allowing techniques from groupoid theory such as presentations and fibrations . Further the stabilisers of the action are the vertex groups, and the orbits of the action are the components, of the action groupoid. For more details, see the book Topology and groupoids referenced below.  This action groupoid comes with a morphism    p  :     G  ‚Ä≤    ‚Üí  G      normal-:  p   normal-‚Üí   superscript  G  normal-‚Ä≤   G     \scriptstyle p:\;G^{\prime}\,\rightarrow\,G   which is a covering morphism of groupoids . This allows a relation between such morphisms and covering maps in topology.  Morphisms and isomorphisms between G -sets  If X and Y are two G -sets, we define a morphism from X to Y to be a function  such that  for all g in G and all x in X . Morphisms of G -sets are also called equivariant maps or G-maps .  The composition of two morphisms is again a morphism.  If a morphism f is bijective , then its inverse is also a morphism, and we call f an isomorphism and the two G -sets X and Y are called isomorphic ; for all practical purposes, they are indistinguishable in this case.  Some example isomorphisms:   Every regular G action is isomorphic to the action of G on G given by left multiplication.  Every free G action is isomorphic to , where S is some set and G acts on  by left multiplication on the first coordinate. ( S can be taken to be the set of orbits X / G .)  Every transitive G action is isomorphic to left multiplication by G on the set of left cosets of some subgroup  H of G . ( H can be taken to be the stabilizer group of any element of the original G -set.the original action.)   With this notion of morphism, the collection of all G -sets forms a category ; this category is a Grothendieck topos (in fact, assuming a classical metalogic, this topos will even be Boolean).  Continuous group actions  One often considers continuous group actions : the group G is a topological group , X is a topological space , and the map  is continuous with respect to the product topology of . The space X is also called a G-space in this case. This is indeed a generalization, since every group can be considered a topological group by using the discrete topology . All the concepts introduced above still work in this context, however we define morphisms between G -spaces to be continuous maps compatible with the action of G . The quotient X / G inherits the quotient topology from X , and is called the quotient space of the action. The above statements about isomorphisms for regular, free and transitive actions are no longer valid for continuous group actions.  If G is a discrete group acting on a topological space  X , the action is properly discontinuous if for any point x in X there is an open neighborhood U of x in X , such that the set of all g in G for which      g   (  U  )    ‚à©   U    ‚â†  ‚àÖ          g  U   U      \scriptstyle g(U)\,\cap\,U\;\neq\;\emptyset   consists of the identity only. If X is a regular covering space of another topological space Y , then the action of the deck transformation group on X is properly discontinuous as well as being free. Every free, properly discontinuous action of a group G on a path-connected topological space X arises in this manner: the quotient map  is a regular covering map, and the deck transformation group is the given action of G on X . Furthermore, if X is simply connected, the fundamental group of X / G will be isomorphic to G .  These results have been generalised in the book Topology and Groupoids referenced below to obtain the fundamental groupoid of the orbit space of a discontinuous action of a discrete group on a Hausdorff space, as, under reasonable local conditions, the orbit groupoid of the fundamental groupoid of the space. This allows calculations such as the fundamental group of the symmetric square of a space X , namely the orbit space of the product of X with itself under the twist action of the cyclic group of order 2 sending  to .  An action of a group G on a locally compact space  X is cocompact if there exists a compact subset A of X such that . For a properly discontinuous action, cocompactness is equivalent to compactness of the quotient space X/G .  The action of G on X is said to be proper if the mapping  that sends  is a proper map .  Strongly continuous group action and smooth points  A group action of a topological group G on a topological space X is said to be strongly continuous if for all x in X , the map  is continuous with respect to the respective topologies. Such an action induces an action on the space of continuous functions on X by defining for every g in G , f a continuous function on X , and x in X . Note that, while every continuous group action is strongly continuous, the converse is not in general true. 4  The subspace of smooth points for the action is the subspace of X of points x such that  is smooth; i.e., it is continuous and all derivatives are continuous.  Variants and generalizations  One can also consider actions of monoids on sets, by using the same two axioms as above. This does not define bijective maps and equivalence relations however. See semigroup action .  Instead of actions on sets, one can define actions of groups and monoids on objects of an arbitrary category : start with an object X of some category, and then define an action on X as a monoid homomorphism into the monoid of endomorphisms of X . If X has an underlying set, then all definitions and facts stated above can be carried over. For example, if we take the category of vector spaces , we obtain group representations in this fashion.  One can view a group G as a category with a single object in which every morphism is invertible. A group action is then nothing but a functor from G to the category of sets , and a group representation is a functor from G to the category of vector spaces . A morphism between G-sets is then a natural transformation between the group action functors. In analogy, an action of a groupoid is a functor from the groupoid to the category of sets or to some other category.  In addition to continuous actions of topological groups on topological spaces, one also often considers smooth actions of Lie groups on smooth manifolds , regular actions of algebraic groups on algebraic varieties , and actions of group schemes on schemes . All of these are examples of group objects acting on objects of their respective category.
