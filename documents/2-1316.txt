In fractional calculus, an area of applied mathematics, the differintegral is a combined differentiation/integration operator. Applied to a function ƒ, the q-differintegral of f, here denoted by
$$\mathbb{D}^qf$$ is the fractional derivative (if q > 0) or fractional integral (if q  \begin{align} {}_a\mathbb{D}^q_tf(t) & = \frac{d^qf(t)}{d(t-a)^q} \\ & =\frac{1}{\Gamma(n-q)} \frac{d^n}{dt^n} \int_{a}^t (t-\tau)^{n-q-1}f(\tau)d\tau \end{align} 

The Grunwald–Letnikov differintegral


The Grunwald–Letnikov differintegral is a direct generalization of the definition of a derivative. It is more difficult to use than the Riemann–Liouville differintegral, but can sometimes be used to solve problems that the Riemann–Liouville cannot.
 

$$\begin{align}
 {}_a\mathbb{D}^q_tf(t) & = \frac{d^qf(t)}{d(t-a)^q} \\
 & =\lim_{N \to \infty}\left[\frac{t-a}{N}\right]^{-q}\sum_{j=0}^{N-1}(-1)^j{q \choose j}f\left(t-j\left[\frac{t-a}{N}\right]\right)
 \end{align}$$

The Weyl differintegral


This is formally similar to the Riemann–Liouville differintegral, but applies to periodic functions, with integral zero over a period.
 

Definitions via transforms
Recall the continuous Fourier transform, here denoted $\mathcal{F}$ :
$$F(\omega) =  \mathcal{F}\{f(t)\} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\int_{-\infty}^\infty f(t) e^{- i\omega t}\,dt$$
Using the continuous Fourier transform, in Fourier space, differentiation transforms into a multiplication:
$$\mathcal{F}\left[\frac{df(t)}{dt}\right] = i \omega \mathcal{F}[f(t)]$$
So,
$$\frac{d^nf(t)}{dt^n} = \mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{(i \omega)^n\mathcal{F}[f(t)]\right\}$$
which generalizes to
$$\mathbb{D}^qf(t)=\mathcal{F}^{-1}\left\{(i \omega)^q\mathcal{F}[f(t)]\right\}.$$
Under the Laplace transform, here denoted by $\mathcal{L}$, differentiation transforms into a multiplication
$$\mathcal{L}\left[\frac{df(t)}{dt}\right] = s\mathcal{L}[f(t)].$$
Generalizing to arbitrary order and solving for Dqf(t), one obtains
$$\mathbb{D}^qf(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{s^q\mathcal{L}[f(t)]\right\}.$$
Basic formal properties
Linearity rules
$$\mathbb{D}^q(f+g)=\mathbb{D}^q(f)+\mathbb{D}^q(g)$$
$$\mathbb{D}^q(af)=a\mathbb{D}^q(f)$$
Zero rule
$$\mathbb{D}^0 f=f \,$$
Product rule
$$\mathbb{D}^q_t(fg)=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty} {q \choose j}\mathbb{D}^j_t(f)\mathbb{D}^{q-j}_t(g)$$
In general, composition (or semigroup) rule
$$\mathbb{D}^a\mathbb{D}^{b}f = \mathbb{D}^{a+b}f$$ is not satisfied.1
A selection of basic formulæ
$$\mathbb{D}^q(t^n)=\frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(n+1-q)}t^{n-q}$$
$$\mathbb{D}^q(\sin(t))=\sin \left( t+\frac{q\pi}{2} \right)$$
$$\mathbb{D}^q(e^{at})=a^q e^{at}$$
