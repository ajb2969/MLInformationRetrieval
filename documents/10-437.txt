   HPO formalism      HPO formalism   The History Projection Operator (HPO) formalism is an approach to temporal  quantum logic developed by Chris Isham . It deals with the logical structure of quantum mechanical  propositions asserted at different points in time.  Introduction  In standard quantum mechanics a physical system is associated with a Hilbert space    ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   . States of the system at a fixed time are represented by normalised vectors in the space and physical observables are represented by Hermitian operators on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   .  A physical proposition    P    P   \,P   about the system at a fixed time can be represented by a projection operator     P  ^     normal-^  P    \hat{P}   on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   (See quantum logic ). This representation links together the lattice operations in the lattice of logical propositions and the lattice of projection operators on a Hilbert space (See quantum logic ).  The HPO formalism is a natural extension of these ideas to propositions about the system that are concerned with more than one time.  History Propositions  Homogeneous Histories  A homogeneous history proposition     α    α   \,\alpha   is a sequence of single-time propositions    α   t  i      subscript  α   subscript  t  i     \alpha_{t_{i}}   specified at different times     t  1   <   t  2   <  …  <   t  n          subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2        normal-…        subscript  t  n      t_{1}   . These times are called the temporal support of the history. We shall denote the proposition    α    α   \,\alpha   as    (   α  1   ,   α  2   ,  …  ,   α  n   )      subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2   normal-…   subscript  α  n     (\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{n})   and read it as  "    α   t  1      subscript  α   subscript  t  1     \alpha_{t_{1}}   at time    t  1     subscript  t  1    t_{1}   is true and then    α   t  2      subscript  α   subscript  t  2     \alpha_{t_{2}}   at time    t  2     subscript  t  2    t_{2}   is true and then   …   normal-…   \ldots   and then    α   t  n      subscript  α   subscript  t  n     \alpha_{t_{n}}   at time    t  n     subscript  t  n    t_{n}   is true"  Inhomogeneous Histories  Not all history propositions can be represented by a sequence of single-time propositions are different times. These are called inhomogeneous history propositions . An example is the proposition    α    α   \,\alpha   OR    β    β   \,\beta   for two homogeneous histories     α   ,  β     α  β    \,\alpha,\beta   .  History Projection Operators  The key observation of the HPO formalism is to represent history propositions by projection operators on a history Hilbert space . This is where the name "History Projection Operator" (HPO) comes from.  For a homogeneous history    α  =   (   α  1   ,   α  2   ,  …  ,   α  n   )       α    subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2   normal-…   subscript  α  n      \alpha=(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\ldots,\alpha_{n})   we can use the tensor product to define a projector       α  ^   :=     α  ^    t  1    ⊗    α  ^    t  2    ⊗  …  ⊗    α  ^    t  n        assign   normal-^  α    tensor-product   subscript   normal-^  α    subscript  t  1     subscript   normal-^  α    subscript  t  2    normal-…   subscript   normal-^  α    subscript  t  n       \hat{\alpha}:=\hat{\alpha}_{t_{1}}\otimes\hat{\alpha}_{t_{2}}\otimes\ldots%
 \otimes\hat{\alpha}_{t_{n}}     where     α  ^    t  i      subscript   normal-^  α    subscript  t  i     \hat{\alpha}_{t_{i}}   is the projection operator on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   that represents the proposition    α   t  i      subscript  α   subscript  t  i     \alpha_{t_{i}}   at time    t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   .  This    α  ^     normal-^  α    \hat{\alpha}   is a projection operator on the tensor product "history Hilbert space"    H  =   ℋ  ⊗  ℋ  ⊗  …  ⊗  ℋ       H   tensor-product  ℋ  ℋ  normal-…  ℋ     H=\mathcal{H}\otimes\mathcal{H}\otimes\ldots\otimes\mathcal{H}     Not all projection operators on   H   H   H   can be written as the sum of tensor products of the form    α  ^     normal-^  α    \hat{\alpha}   . These other projection operators are used to represent inhomogeneous histories by applying lattice operations to homogeneous histories.  Temporal Quantum Logic  Representing history propositions by projectors on the history Hilbert space naturally encodes the logical structure of history propositions. The lattice operations on the set of projection operations on the history Hilbert space   H   H   H   can be applied to model the lattice of logical operations on history propositions.  If two homogeneous histories    α    α   \,\alpha   and    β    β   \,\beta   don't share the same temporal support they can be modified so that they do. If     t   i     subscript  t  i    \,t_{i}   is in the temporal support of    α    α   \,\alpha   but not    β    β   \,\beta   (for example) then a new homogeneous history proposition which differs from    β    β   \,\beta   by including the "always true" proposition at each time     t   i     subscript  t  i    \,t_{i}   can be formed. In this way the temporal supports of     α   ,  β     α  β    \,\alpha,\beta   can always be joined together. What shall therefore assume that all homogeneous histories share the same temporal support.  We now present the logical operations for homogeneous history propositions    α    α   \,\alpha   and    β    β   \,\beta   such that      α  ^    β  ^    =    β  ^    α  ^           normal-^  α    normal-^  β       normal-^  β    normal-^  α      \hat{\alpha}\hat{\beta}=\hat{\beta}\hat{\alpha}     Conjunction (AND)  If   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   are two homogeneous histories then the history proposition "    α    α   \,\alpha   and    β    β   \,\beta   " is also a homogeneous history. It is represented by the projection operator        α  ∧  β   ^   :=    α  ^    β  ^       assign   normal-^    α  β       normal-^  α    normal-^  β      \widehat{\alpha\wedge\beta}:=\hat{\alpha}\hat{\beta}       (    =    β  ^    α  ^     )      absent     normal-^  β    normal-^  α      (=\hat{\beta}\hat{\alpha})     Disjunction (OR)  If   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   are two homogeneous histories then the history proposition "    α    α   \,\alpha   or    β    β   \,\beta   " is in general not a homogeneous history. It is represented by the projection operator        α  ∨  β   ^   :=     α  ^   +   β  ^    -    α  ^    β  ^        assign   normal-^    α  β         normal-^  α    normal-^  β       normal-^  α    normal-^  β       \widehat{\alpha\vee\beta}:=\hat{\alpha}+\hat{\beta}-\hat{\alpha}\hat{\beta}     Negation (NOT)  The negation operation in the lattice of projection operators takes    P  ^     normal-^  P    \hat{P}   to       ¬   P  ^    :=   𝕀  -   P  ^       assign      normal-^  P      𝕀   normal-^  P      \neg\hat{P}:=\mathbb{I}-\hat{P}     where   𝕀   𝕀   \mathbb{I}   is the identity operator on the Hilbert space. Thus the projector used to represent the proposition    ¬  α       α    \neg\alpha   (i.e. "not   α   α   \alpha   ") is        ¬  α   ^   :=   𝕀  -   α  ^       assign   normal-^     α      𝕀   normal-^  α      \widehat{\neg\alpha}:=\mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}     where   𝕀   𝕀   \mathbb{I}   is the identity operator on the history Hilbert space.  Example: Two-time history  As an example, consider the negation of the two-time homogeneous history proposition     α   =   (   α  1   ,   α  2   )       α    subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2      \,\alpha=(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2})   . The projector to represent the proposition    ¬  α       α    \neg\alpha   is        ¬  α   ^   =    𝕀  ⊗  𝕀   -     α  ^   1   ⊗    α  ^   2          normal-^     α       tensor-product  𝕀  𝕀    tensor-product   subscript   normal-^  α   1    subscript   normal-^  α   2       \widehat{\neg\alpha}=\mathbb{I}\otimes\mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}_{1}\otimes\hat{%
 \alpha}_{2}        =     (   𝕀  -    α  ^   1    )   ⊗    α  ^   2    +     α  ^   1   ⊗   (   𝕀  -    α  ^   2    )    +    (   𝕀  -    α  ^   1    )   ⊗   (   𝕀  -    α  ^   2    )         absent     tensor-product    𝕀   subscript   normal-^  α   1     subscript   normal-^  α   2     tensor-product   subscript   normal-^  α   1     𝕀   subscript   normal-^  α   2      tensor-product    𝕀   subscript   normal-^  α   1      𝕀   subscript   normal-^  α   2        =(\mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}_{1})\otimes\hat{\alpha}_{2}+\hat{\alpha}_{1}\otimes(%
 \mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}_{2})+(\mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}_{1})\otimes(\mathbb{I}-%
 \hat{\alpha}_{2})     The terms which appear in this expression:        (   𝕀  -    α  ^   1    )   ⊗    α  ^   2      tensor-product    𝕀   subscript   normal-^  α   1     subscript   normal-^  α   2     (\mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}_{1})\otimes\hat{\alpha}_{2}             α  ^   1   ⊗   (   𝕀  -    α  ^   2    )      tensor-product   subscript   normal-^  α   1     𝕀   subscript   normal-^  α   2      \hat{\alpha}_{1}\otimes(\mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}_{2})            (   𝕀  -    α  ^   1    )   ⊗   (   𝕀  -    α  ^   2    )      tensor-product    𝕀   subscript   normal-^  α   1      𝕀   subscript   normal-^  α   2      (\mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}_{1})\otimes(\mathbb{I}-\hat{\alpha}_{2})   .   can each be interpreted as follows:        α   1     subscript  α  1    \,\alpha_{1}   is false and     α   2     subscript  α  2    \,\alpha_{2}   is true         α   1     subscript  α  1    \,\alpha_{1}   is true and     α   2     subscript  α  2    \,\alpha_{2}   is false    both     α   1     subscript  α  1    \,\alpha_{1}   is false and     α   2     subscript  α  2    \,\alpha_{2}   is false   These three homogeneous histories, joined together with the OR operation, include all the possibilities for how the proposition "     α   1     subscript  α  1    \,\alpha_{1}   and then     α   2     subscript  α  2    \,\alpha_{2}   " can be false. We therefore see that the definition of     ¬  α   ^     normal-^     α     \widehat{\neg\alpha}   agrees with what the proposition    ¬  α       α    \neg\alpha   should mean.  References   C.J.
