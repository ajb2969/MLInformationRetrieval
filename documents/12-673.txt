   Body wave magnitude      Body wave magnitude   Body wave magnitude (     m  b     subscript  m  b    m_{b}    ) is a way of determining the size of an earthquake , using the amplitude of the initial P-wave to calculate the magnitude. The P-wave is a type of body wave that is capable of traveling through the earth at a velocity of around 5 to 8 km/s, and is the first wave from an earthquake to reach a seismometer . Because of this, calculating the body wave magnitude can be the quickest method of determining the size of an earthquake that is of a large distance from the seismometer.  Limitations in the calculation method mean that body wave magnitude saturates at around 6-6.5    m  b     subscript  m  b    m_{b}   , with the figure staying the same even when the moment magnitude may be higher.
