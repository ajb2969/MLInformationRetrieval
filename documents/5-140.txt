   Moment problem      Moment problem   In mathematics , a moment problem arises as the result of trying to invert the mapping that takes a measure μ to the sequences of moments        m  n   =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞      x  n    d  μ   (  x  )      .       subscript  m  n     superscript   subscript             superscript  x  n   d  μ  x      m_{n}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x^{n}\,d\mu(x)\,.\,\!     More generally, one may consider        m  n   =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     M  n    (  x  )   d  μ   (  x  )      .       subscript  m  n     superscript   subscript             subscript  M  n   x  d  μ  x      m_{n}=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}M_{n}(x)\,d\mu(x)\,.\,\!   for an arbitrary sequence of functions M n .  Introduction  In the classical setting, μ is a measure on the real line , and M is in the sequence { x n : n = 0, 1, 2, ... }. In this form the question appears in probability theory , asking whether there is a probability measure having specified mean , variance and so on, and whether it is unique.  There are three named classical moment problems: the Hamburger moment problem in which the support of μ is allowed to be the whole real line; the Stieltjes moment problem , for [0, +∞); and the Hausdorff moment problem for a bounded interval, which without loss of generality may be taken as [0, 1].  Existence  A sequence of numbers m n is the sequence of moments of a measure μ if and only if a certain positivity condition is fulfilled; namely, the Hankel matrices  H n ,         (   H  n   )    i  j    =    m   i  +  j      ,       subscript   subscript  H  n     i  j     subscript  m    i  j      (H_{n})_{ij}=m_{i+j}\,,\,\!     should be positive semi-definite . A condition of similar form is necessary and sufficient for the existence of a measure   μ   μ   \mu   supported on a given interval [ a , b ].  One way to prove these results is to consider the linear functional   φ   φ   \scriptstyle\varphi   that sends a polynomial       P   (  x  )    =    ∑  k     a  k    x  k           P  x     subscript   k      subscript  a  k    superscript  x  k       P(x)=\sum_{k}a_{k}x^{k}\,\!     to        ∑  k     a  k    m  k     .      subscript   k      subscript  a  k    subscript  m  k      \sum_{k}a_{k}m_{k}.\,\!     If m kn are the moments of some measure μ supported on [ a , b ], then evidently      Vice versa, if () holds, one can apply the M. Riesz extension theorem and extend   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   to a functional on the space of continuous functions with compact support C 0 ([ a , b ]), so that      such that ƒ ≥ 0 on [ a , b ].  By the Riesz representation theorem , () holds iff there exists a measure μ supported on [ a , b ], such that       ϕ   (  f  )    =   ∫    f   d  μ          ϕ  f       f  d  μ      \phi(f)=\int f\,d\mu\,\!     for every ƒ ∈ C 0 ([ a , b ]).  Thus the existence of the measure   μ   μ   \mu   is equivalent to (). Using a representation theorem for positive polynomials on [ a , b ], one can reformulate () as a condition on Hankel matrices .  See Refs. 1–3. for more details.  Uniqueness (or determinacy)  The uniqueness of μ in the Hausdorff moment problem follows from the Weierstrass approximation theorem , which states that polynomials are dense under the uniform norm in the space of continuous functions on [0, 1]. For the problem on an infinite interval, uniqueness is a more delicate question; see Carleman's condition , Krein's condition and Ref. 2.  Variations  An important variation is the truncated moment problem , which studies the properties of measures with fixed first k moments (for a finite k ). Results on the truncated moment problem have numerous applications to extremal problems , optimisation and limit theorems in probability theory .
