   Extension and contraction of ideals      Extension and contraction of ideals   In commutative algebra , the extension and contraction of ideals are operations performed on sets of ideals .  Extension of an ideal  Let A and B be two commutative rings with unity , and let f : A → B be a (unital) ring homomorphism . If   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   is an ideal in A , then    f   (  𝔞  )       f  𝔞    f(\mathfrak{a})   need not be an ideal in B (e.g. take f to be the inclusion of the ring of integers Z into the field of rationals Q ). The extension     𝔞  e     superscript  𝔞  e    \mathfrak{a}^{e}   of   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   in B is defined to be the ideal in B generated by    f   (  𝔞  )       f  𝔞    f(\mathfrak{a})   . Explicitly,       𝔞  e   =   {   ∑    y  i   f   (   x  i   )     :     x  i   ∈  𝔞   ,    y  i   ∈  B    }        superscript  𝔞  e    conditional-set       subscript  y  i   f   subscript  x  i      formulae-sequence     subscript  x  i   𝔞      subscript  y  i   B       \mathfrak{a}^{e}=\Big\{\sum y_{i}f(x_{i}):x_{i}\in\mathfrak{a},y_{i}\in B\Big\}     Contraction of an ideal  If   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   is an ideal of B , then     f   -  1     (  𝔟  )        superscript  f    1    𝔟    f^{-1}(\mathfrak{b})   is always an ideal of A , called the contraction     𝔟  c     superscript  𝔟  c    \mathfrak{b}^{c}   of   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   to A .  Properties  Assuming f : A → B is a unital ring homomorphism,   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   is an ideal in A ,   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   is an ideal in B , then:      𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   is prime in B    ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow       𝔟  c     superscript  𝔟  c    \mathfrak{b}^{c}   is prime in A .         𝔞   e  c    ⊇  𝔞      𝔞   superscript  𝔞    e  c      \mathfrak{a}^{ec}\supseteq\mathfrak{a}            𝔟   c  e    ⊆  𝔟       superscript  𝔟    c  e    𝔟    \mathfrak{b}^{ce}\subseteq\mathfrak{b}        It is false, in general, that   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   being prime (or maximal) in A implies that    𝔞  e     superscript  𝔞  e    \mathfrak{a}^{e}   is prime (or maximal) in B . Many classic examples of this stem from algebraic number theory. For example, embedding     ℤ  →   ℤ   [  i  ]       normal-→  ℤ    ℤ   delimited-[]  i      \mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{Z}\left[i\right]   . In    B  =   ℤ   [  i  ]        B    ℤ   delimited-[]  i      B=\mathbb{Z}\left[i\right]   , the element 2 factors as    2  =    (   1  +  i   )    (   1  -  i   )        2      1  i     1  i      2=(1+i)(1-i)   where (one can show) neither of     1  +  i   ,   1  -  i        1  i     1  i     1+i,1-i   are units in B . So     (  2  )   e     superscript  2  e    (2)^{e}   is not prime in B (and therefore not maximal, as well). Indeed,      (   1  ±  i   )   2   =   ±   2  i         superscript   plus-or-minus  1  i   2    plus-or-minus    2  i      (1\pm i)^{2}=\pm 2i   shows that     (   1  +  i   )   =   (    (   1  -  i   )   -    (   1  -  i   )   2    )         1  i       1  i    superscript    1  i   2      (1+i)=((1-i)-(1-i)^{2})   ,     (   1  -  i   )   =   (    (   1  +  i   )   -    (   1  +  i   )   2    )         1  i       1  i    superscript    1  i   2      (1-i)=((1+i)-(1+i)^{2})   , and therefore      (  2  )   e   =    (   1  +  i   )   2        superscript  2  e    superscript    1  i   2     (2)^{e}=(1+i)^{2}   .    On the other hand, if f is surjective and    𝔞  ⊇   ker  f        ker  f   𝔞    \mathfrak{a}\supseteq\mathop{\mathrm{ker}}f   then:        𝔞   e  c    =  𝔞       superscript  𝔞    e  c    𝔞    \mathfrak{a}^{ec}=\mathfrak{a}   and     𝔟   c  e    =  𝔟       superscript  𝔟    c  e    𝔟    \mathfrak{b}^{ce}=\mathfrak{b}   .    Extension of prime ideals is not prime in general, but if f is surjective   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   is a prime ideal in A    ⇔   normal-⇔   \Leftrightarrow       𝔞  e     superscript  𝔞  e    \mathfrak{a}^{e}   is a prime ideal in B .       𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   is a maximal ideal in A    ⇔   normal-⇔   \Leftrightarrow       𝔞  e     superscript  𝔞  e    \mathfrak{a}^{e}   is a maximal ideal in B .   Extension of prime ideals in number theory  Let K be a field extension of L , and let B and A be the rings of integers of K and L , respectively. Then B is an integral extension of A , and we let f be the inclusion map from A to B . The behaviour of a prime ideal     𝔞  =  𝔭      𝔞  𝔭    \mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{p}   of A under extension is one of the central problems of algebraic number theory .
