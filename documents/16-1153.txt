   Draft:Ring of invariants      Draft:Ring of invariants   In algebra, the ring of invariants is the subring of a ring R with an action of a group G that consists of all elements x such that     g  ⋅  x   =  x       normal-⋅  g  x   x    g\cdot x=x   for every g in G . It is denoted by R G (the same notation as the fixed-point subgroup .) Along with a module of covariants , it is a central object of study in invariant theory . Geometrically, the rings of invariants are the coordinate rings of (affine or projective) GIT quotients and they play fundamental roles in the constructions in geometric invariant theory .  Let S be the symmetric algebra of a finite-dimensional G -module. Let     F  G    (  t  )        subscript  F  G   t    F_{G}(t)   be the Poincaré series of the invariant ring S G . Then  Let G be a finite group. Then G is a reflection group if and only if   S   S   S   is a free module (of finite rank) over S G .  Let G be a finite group and V a finite-dimensional G -module. Then G acts on the ring of polynomial functions on V as a left regular representation . Molien's formula says      References     .   "
