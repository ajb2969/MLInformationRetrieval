Draft:Ring of invariants

In algebra, the ring of invariants is the subring of a ring R with an action of a group G that consists of all elements x such that 
 
 
 
  for every g in G. It is denoted by RG (the same notation as the fixed-point subgroup.) Along with a module of covariants, it is a central object of study in invariant theory. Geometrically, the rings of invariants are the coordinate rings of (affine or projective) GIT quotients and they play fundamental roles in the constructions in geometric invariant theory.
Let S be the symmetric algebra of a finite-dimensional G-module. Let 
 
 
 
  be the Poincar√© series of the invariant ring SG. Then
Let G be a finite group. Then G is a reflection group if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a free module (of finite rank) over SG.
Let G be a finite group and V a finite-dimensional G-module. Then G acts on the ring of polynomial functions on V as a left regular representation. Molien's formula says
