Better-quasi-ordering

In order theory a better-quasi-ordering or bqo is a quasi-ordering that does not admit a certain type of bad array. Every bqo is well-quasi-ordered.
Motivation
Though wqo is an appealing notion, many important infinitary operations do not preserve wqoness. An example due to Richard Rado illustrates this.1 In a 1965 paper Crispin Nash-Williams formulated the stronger notion of bqo in order to prove that the class of trees of height ω is wqo under the topological minor relation.2 Since then, many quasi-orders have been proven to be wqo by proving them to be bqo. For instance, Richard Laver established Fraïssé's conjecture by proving that the class of scattered linear order types is bqo.3 More recently, Carlos Martinez-Ranero has proven that, under the Proper Forcing Axiom, the class of Aronszajn lines is bqo under the embeddability relation.4
Definition
It is common in bqo theory to write 
 
 
 
  for the sequence 
 
 
 
  with the first term omitted. Write 
 
 
 
  for the set of finite, strictly increasing sequences with terms in 
 
 
 
 , and define a relation 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  as follows
 
 
 
  if and only if there is 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a strict initial segment of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Note that the relation 
 
 
 
  is not transitive.
A block is a subset B of 
 
 
 
  that contains an initial segment of every infinite subset of 
 
 
 
 . For a quasi-order

 
  a 

 
 -pattern is a function from a block B into 
 
 
 
 . A 
 
 
 
 -pattern 
 
 
 
  is said to be bad if 
 
 
 
  for every pair 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ; otherwise 
 
 
 
  is good. A quasi-order

 
  is better-quasi-ordered (bqo) if there is no bad 
 
 
 
 -pattern.
In order to make this definition easier to work with, Nash-Williams defines a barrier to be a block whose elements are pairwise incomparable under the inclusion relation 
 
 
 
 . A 

 
 -array is a 
 
 
 
 -pattern whose domain is a barrier. By observing that every block contains a barrier, one sees that 
 
 
 
  is bqo if and only if there is no bad 
 
 
 
 -array.
Simpson's alternative definition
Simpson introduced an alternative definition of bqo in terms of Borel maps 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , the set of infinite subsets of 
 
 
 
 , is given the usual (product) topology.5
Let 

 be a quasi-order and endow 
 
 
 
  with the discrete topology. A 

 
 -array is a Borel function

 
  for some infinite subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 . A 
 
 
 
 -array 
 
 
 
  is bad if 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
  is good otherwise. The quasi-order 
 
 
 
  is bqo if there is no bad 
 
 
 
 -array in this sense.
Major theorems
Many major results in bqo theory are consequences of the Minimal Bad Array Lemma, which appears in Simpson's paper6 as follows. See also Laver's paper,7 where the Minimal Bad Array Lemma was first stated as a result. The technique was present in Nash-Williams' original 1965 paper.
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-order. A partial ranking

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is a well-founded partial ordering of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . For bad 
 
 
 
 -arrays (in the sense of Simpson) 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , define:





 
  We say a bad 
 
 
 
 -array 
 
 
 
  is minimal bad (with respect to the partial ranking 
 
 
 
 ) if there is no bad 
 
 
 
 -array 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Note that the definitions of 
 
 
 
  and 
Theorem (Minimal Bad Array Lemma). Let 
 
 
 
  be a quasi-order equipped with a partial ranking and suppose 
 
 
 
  is a bad 
 
 
 
 -array. Then there is a minimal bad 
 
 
 
 -array 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
