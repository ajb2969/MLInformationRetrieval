<h1>Carlos P. Garcia</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Carlos Polestico Garcia</strong>, commonly known as <strong>Carlos P. Garcia</strong>, (November 4, 1896 – June 14, 1971) was a <a href="Filipino_people" title="wikilink">Filipino</a> teacher, poet, orator, lawyer, public official, political economist, organized guerrilla and Commonwealth military leader, who was the <a href="List_of_Presidents_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">eighth</a> <a href="President_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">President of the Philippines</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>

<p>Garcia was born in <a href="Talibon,_Bohol" title="wikilink">Talibon, Bohol</a> on November 4, 1896, to Policronio Garcia and Ambrosia Polestico, who were both natives of <a href="Bangued,_Abra" title="wikilink">Bangued</a>, <a href="Abra_province" title="wikilink">Abra</a>.</p>

<p>Garcia grew up with politics, with his father serving as a municipal mayor for four terms. He acquired his primary education in his native town Talibon, then took his secondary education in Cebu Provincial High School, both on top of his class. Initially, he pursued his college education at <a href="Silliman_University" title="wikilink">Silliman University</a> in <a href="Dumaguete_City" title="wikilink">Dumaguete City</a>, <a href="Negros_Oriental" title="wikilink">Negros Oriental</a>, and later studied at <strong>the Philippine Law School</strong> where he earned his law degree in 1923. He was among the top ten in the bar examination.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Rather than practice law right away, he worked as a teacher for two years at Bohol Provincial High School. He became famous for his poetry in Bohol, where he earned the nickname "Prince of <a href="Visayan_languages" title="wikilink">Visayan</a> Poets" and the "Bard from Bohol".</p>

<p>On May 24, 1933, he married <a href="Leonila_Garcia" title="wikilink">Leonila Dimataga</a>, and they had a daughter, Linda Garcia-Campos.</p>

<h2 id="political-career">Political Career</h2>

<p>Garcia entered politics in 1925, scoring an impressive victory to become <a href="House_of_Representatives_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Representative</a> of the Third District of <a class="uri" href="Bohol" title="wikilink">Bohol</a>. He was elected for another term in 1928 and served until 1931. He was elected Governor of Bohol in 1933, but served only until 1941 when he successfully ran for <a href="Senate_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Senate</a>, but he was unable to serve due to the <a href="Japanese_occupation_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Japanese occupation of the Philippines</a> during the <a href="Second_World_War" title="wikilink">Second World War</a>. He assumed the office when Congress re-convened in 1945 after Allied liberation and the end of the war. When he resumed duties as senator after the war, he was chosen Senate majority floor leader. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> The press consistently voted him as one of the most outstanding senators. Simultaneously, he occupied a position in the Nacionalista Party.</p>
<h2 id="world-war-ii">World War II</h2>

<p>Garcia refused to cooperate with the Japanese during the war. He did not surrender when he was placed on the wanted list with a price on his head. He instead took part in the guerilla activities and later to the military service of the <a href="Philippine_Commonwealth_Army" title="wikilink">Philippine Commonwealth Army</a> during the liberation campaigns against the Japanese and served as adviser in the free government organized in Bohol.</p>
<h2 id="vice-presidency">Vice-Presidency</h2>

<p>Garcia was the running mate of <a href="Ramón_Magsaysay" title="wikilink">Ramón Magsaysay</a> in the <a href="Philippine_presidential_election,_1953" title="wikilink">1953 presidential election</a> in which both men won. He was appointed <a href="Secretary_of_Foreign_Affairs_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">Secretary of Foreign Affairs</a> by President Magsaysay, and for four years served concurrently as <a href="Vice-President_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Vice-President</a>.</p>

<p>As Secretary of Foreign Affairs, he opened formal reparation negotiations in an effort to end the nine-year technical <a href="state_of_war" title="wikilink">state of war</a> between Japan and the Philippines, leading to an agreement in April 1954. During the <a href="Geneva_Conference_of_1954" title="wikilink">Geneva Conference of 1954</a> on Korean unification and other Asian problems, Garcia, as chairman of the Philippine delegation, attacked communist promises in Asia and defended the U.S. policy in the <a href="Far_East" title="wikilink">Far East</a>. In a speech on May 7, 1954–the day that the <a href="Viet_Minh" title="wikilink">Viet Minh</a> defeated French forces at the <a href="Battle_of_Diên_Biên_Phu" title="wikilink">Battle of Diên Biên Phu</a> in <a class="uri" href="Vietnam" title="wikilink">Vietnam</a>– Garcia repeated the Philippine stand for nationalism and opposition to <a class="uri" href="Communism" title="wikilink">Communism</a>.</p>

<p>Garcia acted as chairman of the eight-nation Southeast Asian Security Conference held in Manila in September 1954, which led to the development of the <a href="Southeast_Asia_Treaty_Organization" title="wikilink">Southeast Asia Treaty Organization</a> (SEATO).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>At the time of President Magsaysay's sudden death on March 17, 1957, Garcia was heading the Philippine delegation to the <a class="uri" href="SEATO" title="wikilink">SEATO</a> conference then being held at <a class="uri" href="Canberra" title="wikilink">Canberra</a>, <a class="uri" href="Australia" title="wikilink">Australia</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Having been immediately notified of the tragedy, Vice President Garcia enplaned back for <a class="uri" href="Manila" title="wikilink">Manila</a>. Upon his arrival he directly repaired to <a href="Malacañang_Palace" title="wikilink">Malacañang Palace</a> to assume the duties of President. Chief Justice <a href="Ricardo_Paras" title="wikilink">Ricardo Paras</a>, of the Supreme Court, was at hand to administer the oath of office. President Garcia's first actions dealt with the declaration of a period of mourning for the whole nation and the burial ceremonies for the late Chief-Executive Magsaysay.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="anti-communism">Anti-Communism</h3>

<p>After much discussion, both official and public, the <a href="Congress_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Congress of the Philippines</a>, finally, approved a bill outlawing the <a href="Communist_Party_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Communist Party of the Philippines</a>. Despite the pressure exerted against the congressional measure, President Carlos P. Garcia signed the said bill into law as Republic Act No. 1700 on June 19, 1957.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>Republic Act № 1700 was superseded by Presidential Decree № 885, entitled "Outlawing Subversive Organization, Penalizing Membership Therein and For Other Purposes." This was amended by Presidential Decree № 1736, and later superseded by Presidential Decree № 1835, entitled, "Codifying The Various Laws on Anti-Subversion and Increasing the Penalties for Membership in Subversive Organization." This, in turn, was amended by Presidential Decree № 1975. On May 5, 1987, Executive Order № 167 repealed Presidential Decrees № 1835 and № 1975 as being unduly restrictive of the constitutional right to form associations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>On September 22, 1992, Republic Act № 1700, as amended, was repealed by Republic Act № 7636.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="filipino-first-policy">Filipino First Policy</h3>

<p>President Garcia exercised the <em>Filipino First Policy</em>, for which he was known. This policy heavily favored Filipino businessmen over foreign investor. He was also responsible for changes in retail trade which greatly affected the Chinese businessmen in the country. In a speech during a joint session of Congress on September 18, 1946, President Garcia said the following:</p>

<h3 id="austerity-program">Austerity Program</h3>

<p>In the face of the trying conditions of the country, President Garcia initiated what has been called "The Austerity Program". His administration was characterized by its austerity program and its insistence on a comprehensive nationalist policy. On March 3, 1960, he affirmed the need for complete economic freedom and added that the government no longer would tolerate the dominance of foreign interests (especially American) in the national economy. He promised to shake off "the yoke of alien domination in business, trade, commerce and industry." Garcia was also credited with his role in reviving Filipino cultural arts.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The main points of the Austerity Program were:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li>The government would tightened up its controls to prevent abuses in the over shipment of exports under license and in under-pricing as well.</li>
<li>There would be a more rigid enforcement of the existing regulations on barter shipments.</li>
<li>Government imports themselves were to be restricted to essential items.</li>
<li>The government also would reduce rice imports to a minimum.</li>
<li>An overhauling of the local transportation system would be attempted so as to reduce the importation of gasoline and spare parts.</li>
<li>The tax system would be revised so as to attain more equitable distribution of the payment-burden and achieve more effective collection from those with ability to pay.</li>
<li>There would be an intensification of food production.</li>
</ol>

<p>The program was hailed<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> by the people at large and confidence was expressed that the measures proposed would help solve the standing problems of the Republic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="bohlenserrano-agreement">Bohlen–Serrano Agreement</h3>

<p>During his administration, he acted on the Bohlen–Serrano Agreement, which shortened the lease of the American Bases from 99 years to 25 years and made it renewable after every five years.</p>
<h3 id="presidential-election">1961 Presidential Election</h3>

<p>At the end of his second term, he ran for re–election in the Presidential elections in November 1961, but was defeated by his Vice-President <a href="Diosdado_Macapagal" title="wikilink">Diosdado Macapagal</a>, who belonged to the opposing <a href="Liberal_Party_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a> (the President and the Vice-President are elected separately in the country).</p>
