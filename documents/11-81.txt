   Glutamate—methylamine ligase      Glutamate—methylamine ligase   In enzymology , a glutamate-methylamine ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-glutamate + methylamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + N 5 -methyl-L-glutamine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-glutamate , and methylamine , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and N5-methyl-L-glutamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:methylamine ligase (ADP-forming) . This enzyme is also called gamma-glutamylmethylamide synthetase .  References     "  Category:EC 6.3.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
