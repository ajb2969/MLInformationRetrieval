   2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine diphosphokinase      2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine diphosphokinase   In enzymology , a 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine diphosphokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + (2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydropteridin-6-yl)methyl diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine , whereas its two products are AMP and (2-amino-4-hydroxy-7,8-dihydropteridin-6-yl)methyl diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring two phosphorus-containing groups ( diphosphotransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine 6'-diphosphotransferase . Other names in common use include 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyldihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase , H2-pteridine-CH2OH pyrophosphokinase , 7,8-dihydroxymethylpterin-pyrophosphokinase , HPPK , 7,8-dihydro-6-hydroxymethylpterin pyrophosphokinase , and hydroxymethyldihydropteridine pyrophosphokinase . This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis .  This enzyme catalyses the first step in a three-step pathway leading to 7,8 dihydrofolate. Bacterial HPPK ( gene folK or sulD) is a protein of 160 to 270 amino acids . 1 In the lower eukaryote  Pneumocystis carinii , HPPK is the central domain of a multifunctional folate synthesis enzyme (gene fas). 2  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 23 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
