   Column space      Column space   In linear algebra , the column space C( A ) of a matrix  A (sometimes called the range of a matrix) is the set of all possible linear combinations of its column vectors .  Let K be a field (such as real or complex numbers). The column space of an m × n matrix with components from K is a linear subspace of the m -space  K m . The dimension of the column space is called the rank of the matrix. 1 A definition for matrices over a ring  K (such as integers ) is also possible .  The column space of a matrix is the image or range of the corresponding matrix transformation .  Definition  Let K be a field of scalars . Let A be an m × n matrix, with column vectors v 1 , v 2 , ..., v n . A linear combination of these vectors is any vector of the form         c  1    𝐯  1    +    c  2    𝐯  2    +  ⋯  +    c  n    𝐯  n     ,         subscript  c  1    subscript  𝐯  1       subscript  c  2    subscript  𝐯  2    normal-⋯     subscript  c  n    subscript  𝐯  n      c_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}+c_{2}\mathbf{v}_{2}+\cdots+c_{n}\mathbf{v}_{n},   where c 1 , c 2 , ..., c n are scalars. The set of all possible linear combinations of v 1 , ... , v n is called the column space of A . That is, the column space of A is the span of the vectors v 1 , ... , v n .  Any linear combination of the column vectors of a matrix A can be written as the product of A with a column vector:         A   [      c  1       ⋮       c  n      ]      =       [      a  11     ⋯     a   1  n        ⋮    ⋱    ⋮       a   m  1      ⋯     a   m  n       ]    [      c  1       ⋮       c  n      ]    =   [        c  1    a  11    +     ⋯     +    c  n    a   1  n          ⋮    ⋮    ⋮         c  1    a   m  1     +     ⋯     +    c  n    a   m  n         ]   =     c  1    [      a  11       ⋮       a   m  1       ]    +  ⋯  +    c  n    [      a   1  n        ⋮       a   m  n       ]           =       c  1    𝐯  1    +  ⋯  +    c  n    𝐯  n             A     subscript  c  1     normal-⋮     subscript  c  n                subscript  a  11   normal-⋯   subscript  a    1  n      normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮     subscript  a    m  1    normal-⋯   subscript  a    m  n         subscript  c  1     normal-⋮     subscript  c  n         limit-from     subscript  c  1    subscript  a  11      normal-⋯       subscript  c  n    subscript  a    1  n        normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋮     limit-from     subscript  c  1    subscript  a    m  1       normal-⋯       subscript  c  n    subscript  a    m  n                  subscript  c  1      subscript  a  11     normal-⋮     subscript  a    m  1       normal-⋯     subscript  c  n      subscript  a    1  n      normal-⋮     subscript  a    m  n             missing-subexpression         subscript  c  1    subscript  𝐯  1    normal-⋯     subscript  c  n    subscript  𝐯  n        \begin{array}[]{rcl}A\begin{bmatrix}c_{1}\\

 c_{n}\end{bmatrix}&=&\begin{bmatrix}a_{11}&\cdots&a_{1n}\\
 \vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
 a_{m1}&\cdots&a_{mn}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}c_{1}\\

 &=&c_{1}\mathbf{v}_{1}+\cdots+c_{n}\mathbf{v}_{n}\end{array}     Therefore, the column space of A consists of all possible products A x , for x ∈ C n . This is the same as the image (or range ) of the corresponding matrix transformation .   Example  If    A  =   [     1    0      0    1      2    0     ]       A    1  0    0  1    2  0      A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
 0&1\\
 2&0\end{bmatrix}   , then the column vectors are v 1 = (1, 0, 2) T and v 2 = (0, 1, 0) T .  A linear combination of v 1 and v 2 is any vector of the form        c  1    [     1      0      2     ]    +    c  2    [     0      1      0     ]     =    [      c  1        c  2        2   c  1       ]             subscript  c  1     1    0    2        subscript  c  2     0    1    0         subscript  c  1      subscript  c  2       2   subscript  c  1        c_{1}\begin{bmatrix}1\\

 0\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}c_{1}\\
 c_{2}\\
 2c_{1}\end{bmatrix}\,      The set of all such vectors is the column space of A . In this case, the column space is precisely the set of vectors ( x , y , z ) ∈ R 3 satisfying the equation z = 2 x (using Cartesian coordinates , this set is a plane through the origin in three-dimensional space ).   Basis  The columns of A span the column space, but they may not form a basis if the column vectors are not linearly independent . Fortunately, elementary row operations do not affect the dependence relations between the column vectors. This makes it possible to use row reduction to find a basis for the column space.  For example, consider the matrix      A  =    [     1    3    1    4      2    7    3    9      1    5    3    1      1    2    0    8     ]   .       A      1  3  1  4    2  7  3  9    1  5  3  1    1  2  0  8    .     A=\begin{bmatrix}1&3&1&4\\
 2&7&3&9\\
 1&5&3&1\\
 1&2&0&8\end{bmatrix}\text{.}   The columns of this matrix span the column space, but they may not be linearly independent , in which case some subset of them will form a basis. To find this basis, we reduce A to reduced row echelon form :       [     1    3    1    4      2    7    3    9      1    5    3    1      1    2    0    8     ]   ∼   [     1    3    1    4      0    1    1    1      0    2    2     -  3       0     -  1      -  1     4     ]   ∼   [     1    0     -  2     1      0    1    1    1      0    0    0     -  5       0    0    0    5     ]   ∼    [     1    0     -  2     0      0    1    1    0      0    0    0    1      0    0    0    0     ]   .        similar-to    1  3  1  4    2  7  3  9    1  5  3  1    1  2  0  8      1  3  1  4    0  1  1  1    0  2  2    3     0    1     1   4      similar-to      1  0    2   1    0  1  1  1    0  0  0    5     0  0  0  5      similar-to        1  0    2   0    0  1  1  0    0  0  0  1    0  0  0  0    .      \begin{bmatrix}1&3&1&4\\
 2&7&3&9\\
 1&5&3&1\\
 1&2&0&8\end{bmatrix}\sim\begin{bmatrix}1&3&1&4\\
 0&1&1&1\\
 0&2&2&-3\\
 0&-1&-1&4\end{bmatrix}\sim\begin{bmatrix}1&0&-2&1\\
 0&1&1&1\\
 0&0&0&-5\\
 0&0&0&5\end{bmatrix}\sim\begin{bmatrix}1&0&-2&0\\
 0&1&1&0\\
 0&0&0&1\\
 0&0&0&0\end{bmatrix}\text{.}    2 At this point, it is clear that the first, second, and fourth columns are linearly independent, while the third column is a linear combination of the first two. (Specifically, v 3 = –2 v 1 + v 2 .) Therefore, the first, second, and fourth columns of the original matrix are a basis for the column space:       [     1      2      1      1     ]   ,   [     3      7      5      2     ]   ,    [     4      9      1      8     ]   .        1    2    1    1      3    7    5    2        4    9    1    8    .     \begin{bmatrix}1\\
 2\\
 1\\
 1\end{bmatrix},\;\;\begin{bmatrix}3\\
 7\\
 5\\
 2\end{bmatrix},\;\;\begin{bmatrix}4\\
 9\\
 1\\
 8\end{bmatrix}\text{.}   Note that the independent columns of the reduced row echelon form are precisely the columns with pivots . This makes it possible to determine which columns are linearly independent by reducing only to echelon form .  The above algorithm can be used in general to find the dependence relations between any set of vectors, and to pick out a basis from any spanning set. A different algorithm for finding a basis from a spanning set is given in the row space article; finding a basis for the column space of A is equivalent to finding a basis for the row space of the transpose matrix A T .  Dimension  The dimension of the column space is called the rank of the matrix. The rank is equal to the number of pivots in the reduced row echelon form , and is the maximum number of linearly independent columns that can be chosen from the matrix. For example, the 4 × 4 matrix in the example above has rank three.  Because the column space is the image of the corresponding matrix transformation , the rank of a matrix is the same as the dimension of the image. For example, the transformation R 4 → R 4 described by the matrix above maps all of R 4 to some four-dimensional subspace .  The nullity of a matrix is the dimension of the null space , and is equal to the number of columns in the reduced row echelon form that do not have pivots. 3 The rank and nullity of a matrix A with n columns are related by the equation:         rank   (  A  )    +   nullity   (  A  )     =  n   .          rank  A     nullity  A    n    \text{rank}(A)+\text{nullity}(A)=n.\,   This is known as the rank-nullity theorem .  Relation to the left null space  The left null space of A is the set of all vectors x such that x T A = 0 T . It is the same as the null space of the transpose of A . The product of the matrix A T and the vector x can be written in terms of the dot product of vectors:         A  𝖳   𝐱   =   [       𝐯  1   ⋅  𝐱         𝐯  2   ⋅  𝐱       ⋮        𝐯  n   ⋅  𝐱      ]    ,         superscript  A  𝖳   𝐱      normal-⋅   subscript  𝐯  1   𝐱      normal-⋅   subscript  𝐯  2   𝐱     normal-⋮     normal-⋅   subscript  𝐯  n   𝐱       A^{\mathsf{T}}\mathbf{x}=\begin{bmatrix}\mathbf{v}_{1}\cdot\mathbf{x}\\
 \mathbf{v}_{2}\cdot\mathbf{x}\\
 \vdots\\
 \mathbf{v}_{n}\cdot\mathbf{x}\end{bmatrix},   because row vectors of A T are transposes of column vectors v k of A . Thus A T x = 0 if and only if x is orthogonal (perpendicular) to each of the column vectors of A .  It follows that the left null space (the null space of A T ) is the orthogonal complement to the column space of A.  For a matrix A , the column space, row space, null space, and left null space are sometimes referred to as the four fundamental subspaces .  For matrices over a ring  Similarly the column space (sometimes disambiguated as right column space) can be defined for matrices over a ring  K as       ∑   k  =  1   n     𝐯  k    c  k        superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  𝐯  k    subscript  c  k      \sum\limits_{k=1}^{n}\mathbf{v}_{k}c_{k}   for any c 1 , ..., c n , with replacement of the vector m -space with " right  free module ", which changes the order of scalar multiplication of the vector v k to the scalar c k such that it is written in an unusual order vector – scalar . 4  See also   Euclidean subspace  Kernel (matrix)  Row space  Four fundamental subspaces  Rank (linear algebra)  Linear span  Matrix (mathematics)   Notes  References  Textbooks             External links   Khan Academy video tutorial    , MIT Linear Algebra Lecture on the Four Fundamental Subspaces at Google Video, from MIT OpenCourseWare   it:Spazi delle righe e delle colonne  nl:Kolom- en rijruimte  ur:قطار اور ستون فضا  zh:行空间与列空间 "  Category:Linear algebra  Category:Matrices     Linear algebra, as discussed in this article, is a very well established mathematical discipline for which there are many sources.
