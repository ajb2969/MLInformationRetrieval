   Tau Sagittarii      Tau Sagittarii   Tau Sagittarii ( Tau Sgr , τ Sagittarii , τ Sgr ) is a star in the southern zodiac  constellation of Sagittarius .  Description  With an apparent visual magnitude of +3.3, 1 this is one of the brighter members of the constellation. The distance of this star from Earth is roughly , based upon parallax measurements. 2  This is a spectral type K1 giant star with 1.5 - 2 Solar masses. The stellar envelope is slightly cooler than the Sun, with an effective temperature of 4,860 K, 3 giving the star a light orange color. The interferometry -measured angular diameter of this star, after correcting for limb darkening , is , 4 which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 16 times the radius of the Sun . 5 Tau Sagittarii is a suspected double star although no companion has been confirmed yet. A lower metal content (Fe to H ratio is 70%) and a high peculiar velocity (64 km/s, 4x the local average) relative to the Sun suggest the star is a visitor from a different part of the Galaxy.  The Wow! signal  Tau Sagittarii is the closest visible star in the night sky to the origin of the 1977 Wow! signal , the only radio signal that has been received that may be a sign of extraterrestrial intelligence. The location of the signal was, in epoch J2000.0 coordinates:   Right ascension (on the positive horn):  Right ascension (on the negative horn):  Declination (the same for both horns):   Name and etymology   This star, together with :  γ Sgr , δ Sgr , ε Sgr , ζ Sgr , λ Sgr , σ Sgr and φ Sgr , comprising the asterism Teapot .    6    φ Sgr , ζ Sgr , χ Sgr and σ Sgr were Al Naʽām al Ṣādirah (النعم السادرة), the Returning Ostriches. 7 According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars , Al Naʽām al Ṣādirah or Namalsadirah was originally the title for four stars: φ Sgr as Namalsadirah I , τ Sgr as Namalsadirah II , χ 1 Sgr as Namalsadirah III and χ 2 Sgr as Namalsadirah IV (except σ Sgr and ζ Sgr ). 8  ν Sgr , ψ Sgr , ω Sgr , 60 Sgr and ζ Sgr were Al Udḥiyy , the Ostrich's Nest. 9   In Chinese ,  (), meaning Dipper , refers to an asterism consisting of τ Sagittarii, φ Sagittarii , λ Sagittarii , μ Sagittarii , σ Sagittarii and ζ Sagittarii . Consequently, τ Sagittarii itself is known as  (, .) 10   References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 31.3\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align}  }}  "  Sagittarii, Tau  Category:Sagittarius (constellation)  Category:K-type giants          skywatchers ↩  ↩  Jack W.
