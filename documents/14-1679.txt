Nevanlinna's criterion

In mathematics, Nevanlinna's criterion in complex analysis, proved in 1920 by the Finnish mathematician Rolf Nevanlinna, characterizes holomorphic univalent functions on the unit disk which are starlike. Nevanlinna used this criterion to prove the Bieberbach conjecture for starlike univalent functions
Statement of criterion
A univalent function h on the unit disk satisfying h(0) = 0 and h'(0) = 1 is starlike, i.e. has image invariant under multilpication by real numbers in [0,1], if and only if 
 
 
 
  has positive real part for |z| 



a semigroup of holomorphic mappinga of D into itself fixing 0.
Moreover h is the Koenigs function for the semigroup ft.
By the Schwarz lemma, |ft(z)| decreases as t increases.
Hence



But, setting w = ft(z),



where



Hence



and so, dividing by |w|2,



Taking reciprocals and letting t go to 0 gives



for all |z|  g(z) =z {h^\prime(z)\over h(z)}
has positive real part and g(0) = 1, then h can vanish only at 0, where it must have a simple zero.
Now



Thus as z traces the circle 
 
 
 
 , the argument of the image 
 
 
 
  increases strictly. By the argument principle, since 
 
 
 
  has a simple zero at 0, it circles the origin just once. The interior of the region bounded by the curve it traces is therefore starlike. If a is a point in the interior then the number of solutions N(a) of h(z) = a with |z|  N(a) ={1\over 2\pi i} \int_{|z|=r} {h^\prime(z) \over h(z)-a}\, dz.
Since this is an integer, depends continuously on a and N(0) = 1, it is identically 1. So h is univalent and starlike in each disk |z|  g(z)= 1 +b_1 z + b_2 z^2 + \cdots.
is a holomorphic function on the unit disk D with positive real part, then12



In fact it suffices to show the result with g replaced by gr(z) = g(rz) for any r  g(z) = {1\over 2\pi} \int_0^{2\pi} { e^{i\theta}+ z\over e^{i\theta} -z} \Re g(e^{i\theta})\, d\theta.
Using the identity



it follows that


 
 ,
so defines a probability measure, and



Hence



Proof for starlike functions
Let



be a univalent starlike function in |z| |a_n|\le n.
In fact by Nevanlinna's criterion



has positive real part for |z| |b_n|\le 2.
On the other hand



gives the recurrence relation



where a1 = 1. Thus



so it follows by induction that
