Diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase

In enzymology, a diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,3-diaminopropanoate + H2O 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + 2 NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2,3-diaminopropionate and H2O, whereas its two products are pyruvate and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,3-diaminopropanoate ammonia-lyase (adding H2O; pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include diaminopropionatase, alpha,beta-diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase, 2,3-diaminopropionate ammonia-lyase, and 2,3-diaminopropanoate ammonia-lyase. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
