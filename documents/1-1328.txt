   Ovality      Ovality   In telecommunications and fiber optics , ovality or noncircularity is the degree of deviation from perfect circularity of the cross section of the core or cladding of the fiber.  The cross-sections of the core and cladding are assumed to a first approximation to be elliptical. Quantitatively, the ovality of either the core or cladding is expressed as     2   (   a  -  b   )     a  +  b         2    a  b      a  b     \frac{2(a-b)}{a+b}   , where a is the length of the major axis and b is the length of the minor axis. The dimensionless quantity so obtained may be multiplied by 100 to express ovality as a percentage. Alternatively, ovality of the core or cladding may be specified by a tolerance field consisting of two concentric circles, within which the cross section boundaries must lie.  In measurements, ovality is the amount of out-of-roundness of a hole or cylindrical part in the typical form of an oval.  In chemistry  In computational chemistry , especially in QSAR 1 studies, ovality 2 refers to, a measure of how the shape of a molecule approaches a sphere (at one extreme) or a cigar shape (at the other). Ovality is described by a ratio of volume to area:      O  =   A   4  π    (    3  V    4  π    )    2  3          O    A    4  π   superscript      3  V     4  π      2  3        O=\frac{A}{4\pi(\frac{3V}{4\pi})^{\frac{2}{3}}}     where:   O = Ovality  A = Area  V = Volume   The ovality of the He atom is 1.0 and that of HC 24 H (12 triple bonds) is ~1.7 .
