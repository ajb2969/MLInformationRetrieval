   De Bruijn–Newman constant      De Bruijn–Newman constant   The De Bruijn–Newman constant , denoted by Λ and named after Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn and Charles M. Newman , is a mathematical constant defined via the zeros of a certain function  H ( λ , z ), where λ is a real parameter and z is a complex variable. H has only real zeros if and only if λ ≥ Λ. The constant is closely connected with Riemann's hypothesis concerning the zeros of the Riemann zeta-function . In brief, the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the conjecture that Λ ≤ 0.  De Bruijn showed in 1950 that H has only real zeros if λ ≥ 1/2, and moreover, that if H has only real zeros for some λ, H also has only real zeros if λ is replaced by any larger value. Newman proved in 1976 the existence of a constant Λ for which the "if and only if" claim holds; and this then implies that Λ is unique. Newman conjectured that Λ ≥ 0, an intriguing counterpart to the Riemann hypothesis. Serious calculations on lower bounds for Λ have been made since 1988 and—as can be seen from the table—are still being made:      Year   Lower bound on Λ       1988   −50     1991   −5     1990   −0.385     1994   −4.379     ×    10  −   6       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   6     \times 10^{−}6        1993   −5.895     ×    10  −   9       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   9     \times 10^{−}9        2000   −2.7     ×    10  −   9       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   9     \times 10^{−}9        2011   −1.1     ×    10  −   12       absent     superscript  10  normal-−   12     \times 10^{−}12    1     Since    H   (  λ  ,  z  )       H   λ  z     H(\lambda,z)   is just the Fourier transform of    F   (    e   λ  x    Φ   )       F     superscript  e    λ  x    normal-Φ     F(e^{\lambda x}\Phi)   then H has the Wiener–Hopf representation :       ξ   (    1  /  2   +   i  z    )    =   A   π     (  λ  )    -  1      ∫   -  ∞   ∞     e     -  1    4  λ      (   x  -  z   )   2     H   (  λ  ,  x  )   d  x           ξ      1  2     i  z       A    π    superscript  λ    1      superscript   subscript             superscript  e        1     4  λ     superscript    x  z   2     H   λ  x   d  x       \xi(1/2+iz)=A\sqrt{\pi}(\lambda)^{-1}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{\frac{-1}{4%
