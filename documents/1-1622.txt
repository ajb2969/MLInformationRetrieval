Uniform convergence




Uniform convergence

In the mathematical field of analysis, uniform convergence is a type of convergence stronger than pointwise convergence. A sequence {fn} of functions converges uniformly to a limiting function f if the speed of convergence of fn(x) to f(x) does not depend on x.
The concept is important because several properties of the functions fn, such as continuity and Riemann integrability, are transferred to the limit f if the convergence is uniform, but not necessarily if the convergence is not.
Uniform convergence to a function on a given interval can be defined in terms of the uniform norm.
History
In 1821 Augustin Louis Cauchy published a proof that a convergent sum of continuous functions is always continuous, to which Niels Henrik Abel in 1826 found purported counterexamples in the context of Fourier series, arguing that Cauchy's proof had to be incorrect. Completely standard notions of convergence did not exist at the time, and Cauchy handled convergence using infinitesimal methods. When put into the modern language, what Cauchy proved is that a uniformly convergent sequence of continuous functions has a continuous limit. The failure of a merely pointwise-convergent limit of continuous functions to converge to a continuous function illustrates the importance of distinguishing between different types of convergence when handling sequences of functions.1
The term uniform convergence was probably first used by Christoph Gudermann, in an 1838 paper on elliptic functions, where he employed the phrase "convergence in a uniform way" when the "mode of convergence" of a series 
 
 
 
  is independent of the variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  While he thought it a "remarkable fact" when a series converged in this way, he did not give a formal definition, nor use the property in any of his proofs.2
Later Gudermann's pupil Karl Weierstrass, who attended his course on elliptic functions in 1839–1840, coined the term gleichmäßig konvergent () which he used in his 1841 paper Zur Theorie der Potenzreihen, published in 1894. Independently a similar concept was used by Philipp Ludwig von Seidel3 and George Gabriel Stokes but without having any major impact on further development. G. H. Hardy compares the three definitions in his paper "Sir George Stokes and the concept of uniform convergence" and remarks: "Weierstrass's discovery was the earliest, and he alone fully realized its far-reaching importance as one of the fundamental ideas of analysis."
Under the influence of Weierstrass and Bernhard Riemann this concept and related questions were intensely studied at the end of the 19th century by Hermann Hankel, Paul du Bois-Reymond, Ulisse Dini, Cesare Arzelà and others.
Definition
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a set and 
 
 
 
  is a real-valued function for every natural number

 
 . We say that the sequence 
 
 
 
  is uniformly convergent with limit 
 
 
 
  if for every 
 
 
 
 , there exists a natural number 
 
 
 
  such that for all 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 .
Consider the sequence 
 
 
 
  where the supremum is taken over all 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  converges to 
 
 
 
  uniformly if and only if

 
  tends to 0.
The sequence 
 
 
 
  is said to be locally uniformly convergent with limit 
 
 
 
  if for every 
 
 
 
  in some metric space 
 
 
 
 , there exists an 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  converges uniformly on 
 
 
 
 .
Notes
Note that interchanging the order of "there exists 
 
 
 
 " and "for all 
 
 
 
 " in the definition above results in a statement equivalent to the pointwise convergence of the sequence. That notion can be defined as follows: the sequence (fn) converges pointwise with limit 
 
 
 
  if and only if

for every 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
 , there exists a natural number N such that for all 
 
 
 
  one has fn(x) − f(x){{!}} .
 

Here the order of the universal quantifiers for 
 
 
 
  and for 
 
 
 
  is not important, but the order of the former and the existential quantifier for 
 
 
 
  is.
In the case of uniform convergence, 
 
 
 
  can only depend on 
 
 
 
 , while in the case of pointwise convergence 
 
 
 
  may depend on both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It is therefore plain that uniform convergence implies pointwise convergence. The converse is not true, as the following example shows: take 
 
 
 
  to be the unit interval [0,1] and define  xn}} for every natural number 
 
 
 
 . Then  converges pointwise to the function 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 

Generalizations
One may straightforwardly extend the concept to functions S → M, where (M, d) is a metric space, by replacing |fn(x) − f(x)| with d(fn(x), f(x)).
The most general setting is the uniform convergence of nets of functions S → X, where X is a uniform space. We say that the net (fα) converges uniformly with limit f : S → X if and only if

for every entourage V in X, there exists an α0, such that for every x in S and every α ≥ α0: (fα(x), f(x)) is in V.
 

The above-mentioned theorem, stating that the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous, remains correct in these settings.
Definition in a hyperreal setting
Uniform convergence admits a simplified definition in a hyperreal setting. Thus, a sequence 
 
 
 
  converges to f uniformly if for all x in the domain of f* and all infinite n, 
 
 
 
  is infinitely close to 
 
 
 
  (see microcontinuity for a similar definition of uniform continuity).
Examples
Given a topological space X, we can equip the space of bounded real or complex-valued functions over X with the uniform norm topology. Then uniform convergence simply means convergence in the uniform norm topology.
The sequence 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  converges pointwise but not uniformly:



In this example one can easily see that pointwise convergence does not preserve differentiability or continuity. While each function of the sequence is smooth, that is to say that for all n, 
 
 
 
 , the limit 
 
 
 
  is not even continuous.
Exponential function
The series expansion of the exponential function can be shown to be uniformly convergent on any bounded subset S of 
 
 
 
  using the Weierstrass M-test.
Here is the series:








Any bounded subset is a subset of some disc 
 
 
 
  of radius R, centered on the origin in the complex plane. The Weierstrass M-test requires us to find an upper bound 
 
 
 
  on the terms of the series, with 
 
 
 
  independent of the position in the disc:








This is trivial:











If 
 
 
 
  is convergent, then the M-test asserts that the original series is uniformly convergent.
The ratio test can be used here:








which means the series over 
 
 
 
  is convergent. Thus the original series converges uniformly for all 
 
 
 
 , and since 
 
 
 
 , the series is also uniformly convergent on S.
Properties

Every uniformly convergent sequence is locally uniformly convergent.
Every locally uniformly convergent sequence is compactly convergent.
For locally compact spaces local uniform convergence and compact convergence coincide.
A sequence of continuous functions on metric spaces, with the image metric space being complete, is uniformly convergent if and only if it is uniformly Cauchy.
If 
 
 
 
  is a compact interval (or in general a compact topological space), and 
 
 
 
  is a monotone increasing sequence (meaning 
 
 
 
  for all n and x) of continuous functions with a pointwise limit 
 
 
 
  which is also continuous, then the convergence is necessarily uniform (Dini's theorem). Uniform convergence is also guaranteed if 
 
 
 
  is a compact interval and 
 
 
 
  is an equicontinuous sequence that converges pointwise.

Applications
To continuity
(Figure)
Counterexample to a strengthening of the uniform convergence theorem, in which pointwise convergence, rather than uniform convergence, is assumed. The continuous green functions 
 
 
 
  converge to the non-continuous red function. This can happen only if convergence is not uniform.

If 
 
 
 
  is a real interval (or indeed any topological space), we can talk about the continuity of the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The following is the more important result about uniform convergence:

Uniform convergence theorem. If 
 
 
 
  is a sequence of continuous functions all of which are defined on the interval 
 
 
 
  which converges uniformly towards the function 
 
 
 
  on an interval 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is continuous on 
 
 
 
  as well.
 

This theorem is proved by the "
 
 
 
  trick", and is the archetypal example of this trick: to prove a given inequality (
This theorem is important, since pointwise convergence of continuous functions is not enough to guarantee continuity of the limit function as the image illustrates.
More precisely, this theorem states that the uniform limit of uniformly continuous functions is uniformly continuous; for a locally compact space, continuity is equivalent to local uniform continuity, and thus the uniform limit of continuous functions is continuous.
Proof
We will show that 
 
 
 
  is continues at every point of the interval 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a fixed point. Let 
 
 
 
  we will show that there exist 
 
 
 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
  that satisfies 
 
 
 
  holds 
 
 


 
  Now since 
 
 
 
  converges uniformly to 
 
 
 
  then for every 
 
 
 
  there exists 
 
 
 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
  and for every 
 
 
 
  holds


 
  which also implies that


 
  Since 
 
 
 
  is continuous at 
 
 
 
  then for every 
 
 
 
  there exists 
 
 
 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
  that satisfies 
 
 
 
  holds


 
  Thus for every 
 
 
 
  there exists a number 
 
 
 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
 , and every 
 
 
 
  that satisfies 
 
 
 
  holds:


 
  That is for every 
 
 
 
  exists a number 
 
 
 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
  that satisfies 
 
 
 
  holds:


 
  Thus 
 
 
 
  is continuous ate very point Which means that 
 
 
 
  is continuous at every point 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
  is continuous on 
 
 
 
 .
To differentiability
If 
 
 
 
  is an interval and all the functions 
 
 
 
  are differentiable and converge to a limit 
 
 
 
 , it is often desirable to differentiate the limit function 
 
 
 
  by taking the limit of the derivatives of 
 
 
 
 . This is however in general not possible: even if the convergence is uniform, the limit function need not be differentiable, and even if it is differentiable, the derivative of the limit function need not be equal to the limit of the derivatives. Consider for instance 
 
 
 
  with uniform limit 0, but the derivatives do not approach 0. In order to ensure a connection between the limit of a sequence of differenctiable functions and the limit of the sequence of derivatives, the uniform convergence of the sequence of derivatives plus the convergence of the sequence of functions at at least one point is required. The precise statement covering this situation is as follows:4

Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a sequence of functions, differentiable on 
 
 
 
 , and such that 
 
 
 
  converges for some point 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  converges uniformly on 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  converges uniformly to a function 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
 

To integrability
Similarly, one often wants to exchange integrals and limit processes. For the Riemann integral, this can be done if uniform convergence is assumed:

If 
 
 
 
  is a sequence of Riemann integrable functions defined on a compact interval 
 
 
 
  which uniformly converge with limit 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is Riemann integrable and its integral can be computed as the limit of the integrals of the 
 
 
 
 :
 
 




In fact, for a uniformly convergent family of bounded functions on an interval, the upper and lower Riemann integrals converge to the upper and lower Riemann integrals of the limit function. This follows because, for n sufficiently large, the graph of 
 
 
 
  is within 
 
 
 
  of the graph of f, and so the upper sum and lower sum of 
 
 
 
  are each within 
 
 
 
  of the value of the upper and lower sums of 
 
 
 
 , respectively.
Much stronger theorems in this respect, which require not much more than pointwise convergence, can be obtained if one abandons the Riemann integral and uses the Lebesgue integral instead.
To analyticity
If a sequence of analytic functions converges uniformly in a region S of the complex plane, then the limit is analytic in S. This demonstrates an example that complex functions are more well-behaved than real functions, since the uniform limit of analytic functions on a real interval need not even be differentiable.
To series
We say that 
 
 
 
  converges:
i) pointwise on E if and only if the sequence sn converges where sn(x) is the sequence of partial sums.
ii) uniformly on E if and only if sn(x) converges uniformly as n goes to infinity.
iii) absolutely on E if and only if 
 
 
 
  converges for each x in E.
With this definition comes the following result: Theorem: Let x0 be contained in the set E and for each fn is continuous at x0. If f = 
 
 
 
  converges uniformly on E then f is continuous at x0 in E. Suppose that E = 
 
 
 
  and each fn is integrable on 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  converges uniformly on 
 
 
 
  then f is integrable on 
 
 
 
  and the series of integrals of fn is equal to integral of the series of fn. This is known as term by term integration.
Almost uniform convergence
If the domain of the functions is a measure space E then the related notion of almost uniform convergence can be defined. We say a sequence of functions 
 
 
 
  converges almost uniformly on E if for every 
 
 
 
  there exists a measurable set 
 
 
 
  with measure less than 
 
 
 
  such that the sequence of functions 
 
 
 
  converges uniformly on $E \setminus E_\delta$. In other words, almost uniform convergence means there are sets of arbitrarily small measure for which the sequence of functions converges uniformly on their complement.
Note that almost uniform convergence of a sequence does not mean that the sequence converges uniformly almost everywhere as might be inferred from the name.
Egorov's theorem guarantees that on a finite measure space, a sequence of functions that converges almost everywhere also converges almost uniformly on the same set.
Almost uniform convergence implies almost everywhere convergence and convergence in measure.
