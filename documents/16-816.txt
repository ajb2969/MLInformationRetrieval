   Cyclic sieving      Cyclic sieving   In combinatorial mathematics, cyclic sieving is a phenomenon by which evaluating a generating function for a finite set at roots of unity counts symmetry classes of objects acted on by a cyclic group . 1  Definition  Let C be a cyclic group generated by an element c of order n . Suppose C  acts on a set X . Let X ( q ) be a polynomial with integer coefficients. Then the triple ( X , X ( q ), C ) is said to exhibit the cyclic sieving phenomenon (CSP) if for all integers d , the value X ( e 2   π   π   \pi    id / n ) is the number of elements fixed by c d . In particular X (1) is the cardinality of the set X , and for that reason X ( q ) is regarded as a generating function for X .  Examples  The q -binomial coefficient       [     n      k     ]   q     subscript   delimited-[]   STACKED  n  k    q    \left[{n\atop k}\right]_{q}     is the polynomial in q defined by         [     n      k     ]   q   =     ∏   i  =  1   n    (   1  +  q  +   q  2   +  ⋯  +   q   i  -  1     )      (    ∏   i  =  1   k    (   1  +  q  +   q  2   +  ⋯  +   q   i  -  1     )    )   ⋅   (    ∏   i  =  1    n  -  k     (   1  +  q  +   q  2   +  ⋯  +   q   i  -  1     )    )      .       subscript   delimited-[]   STACKED  n  k    q       superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n     1  q   superscript  q  2   normal-⋯   superscript  q    i  1       normal-⋅    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    k     1  q   superscript  q  2   normal-⋯   superscript  q    i  1        superscript   subscript  product    i  1      n  k      1  q   superscript  q  2   normal-⋯   superscript  q    i  1          \left[{n\atop k}\right]_{q}=\frac{\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1+q+q^{2}+\cdots+q^{i-1})}{%
 \left(\prod_{i=1}^{k}(1+q+q^{2}+\cdots+q^{i-1})\right)\cdot\left(\prod_{i=1}^{%
 n-k}(1+q+q^{2}+\cdots+q^{i-1})\right)}.     It is easily seen that its value at q = 1 is the usual binomial coefficient     (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   , so it is a generating function for the subsets of {1, 2, ..., n } of size k . These subsets carry a natural action of the cyclic group C of order n which acts by adding 1 to each element of the set, modulo n . For example, when n = 4 and k = 2, the group orbits are       {  1  ,  3  }   →   {  2  ,  4  }   →   {  1  ,  3  }        normal-→   1  3    2  4     normal-→     1  3      \{1,3\}\to\{2,4\}\to\{1,3\}   (of size 2)  and       {  1  ,  2  }   →   {  2  ,  3  }   →   {  3  ,  4  }   →   {  1  ,  4  }   →   {  1  ,  2  }        normal-→   1  2    2  3     normal-→     3  4     normal-→     1  4     normal-→     1  2      \{1,2\}\to\{2,3\}\to\{3,4\}\to\{1,4\}\to\{1,2\}   (of size 4).  One can show 2 that evaluating the q -binomial coefficient when q is an n th root of unity gives the number of subsets fixed by the corresponding group element.  In the example n = 4 and k = 2, the q -binomial coefficient is         [     4      2     ]   q   =   1  +  q  +   2   q  2    +   q  3   +   q  4     ;       subscript   delimited-[]   STACKED  4  2    q     1  q    2   superscript  q  2     superscript  q  3    superscript  q  4      \left[{4\atop 2}\right]_{q}=1+q+2q^{2}+q^{3}+q^{4};     evaluating this polynomial at q = 1 gives 6 (as all six subsets are fixed by the identity element of the group); evaluating it at q = −1 gives 2 (the subsets {1, 3} and {2, 4} are fixed by two applications of the group generator); and evaluating it at q = ± i gives 0 (no subsets are fixed by one or three applications of the group generator).
