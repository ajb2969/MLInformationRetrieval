Inequalities in information theory

Inequalities are very important in the study of information theory. There are a number of different contexts in which these inequalities appear.
Shannon-type inequalities
Consider a finite collection of finitely (or at most countably) supported random variables on the same probability space. For a collection of n random variables, there are 2n − 1 such non-empty subsets for which entropies can be defined. For example, when n = 2, we may consider the entropies 
 
 

 
  and 
 
 
 
  and express the following inequalities (which together characterize the range of the marginal and joint entropies of two random variables):

















In fact, these can all be expressed as special cases of a single inequality involving the conditional mutual information, namely


 
  where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  each denote the joint distribution of some arbitrary (possibly empty) subset of our collection of random variables. Inequalities that can be derived from this are known as Shannon-type inequalities. More formally (following the notation of Yeung 1), define 
 
 
 
  to be the set of all constructible points in 
 
 
 
  where a point is said to be constructible if and only if there is a joint, discrete distribution of n random variables such that each coordinate of that point, indexed by a non-empty subset of {1, 2, ..., n}, is equal to the joint entropy of the corresponding subset of the n random variables. The closure of 
 
 
 
  is denoted 
 
 
 
  In general



The cone in 
 
 
 
  characterized by all Shannon-type inequalities among n random variables is denoted 
 
 
 
  Software has been developed to automate the task of proving such inequalities 2 .3 Given an inequality, such software is able to determine whether the given inequality contains the cone 
 
 
 
  in which case the inequality can be verified, since 
 
 

Non-Shannon-type inequalities
Other, less trivial inequalities have been discovered among the entropies and joint entropies of four or more random variables, which cannot be derived from Shannon's basic inequalities. These are known as non-Shannon-type inequalities. In 1997 and 1998, Zhang and Yeung reported two non-Shannon-type inequalities.45 The latter implies that


 
  where the inclusions are proper for 
 
 
 
  The two sets above are, in fact, convex cones.
Further non-Shannon-type inequalities were reported in.678 Dougherty et al.9 found a number of non-Shannon-type inequalities by computer search. Matus10 proved the existence of infinitely many linear non-Shannon-type inequalities.
Lower bounds for the Kullback–Leibler divergence
A great many important inequalities in information theory are actually lower bounds for the Kullback–Leibler divergence. Even the Shannon-type inequalities can be considered part of this category, since the bivariate mutual information can be expressed as the Kullback–Leibler divergence of the joint distribution with respect to the product of the marginals, and thus these inequalities can be seen as a special case of Gibbs' inequality.
On the other hand, it seems to be much more difficult to derive useful upper bounds for the Kullback–Leibler divergence. This is because the Kullback–Leibler divergence DKL(P||Q) depends very sensitively on events that are very rare in the reference distribution Q. DKL(P||Q) increases without bound as an event of finite non-zero probability in the distribution P becomes exceedingly rare in the reference distribution Q, and in fact DKL(P||Q) is not even defined if an event of non-zero probability in P has zero probability in Q. (Hence the requirement that P be absolutely continuous with respect to Q.)
Gibbs' inequality
This fundamental inequality states that the Kullback–Leibler divergence is non-negative.
Kullback's inequality
Another inequality concerning the Kullback–Leibler divergence is known as Kullback's inequality.11 If P and Q are probability distributions on the real line with P absolutely continuous with respect to Q, and whose first moments exist, then


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the large deviations rate function, i.e. the convex conjugate of the cumulant-generating function, of Q, and 
 
 
 
  is the first moment of P.
The Cramér–Rao bound is a corollary of this result.
Pinsker's inequality
Pinsker's inequality relates Kullback–Leibler divergence and total variation distance. It states that if P, Q are two probability distributions, then



where



is the Kullback–Leibler divergence in nats and



is the total variation distance.
Other inequalities
Hirschman uncertainty
In 1957,12 Hirschman showed that for a (reasonably well-behaved) function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and its Fourier transform

 
  the sum of the differential entropies of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is non-negative, i.e.


 
  Hirschman conjectured, and it was later proved,13 that a sharper bound of 
 
 
 
  which is attained in the case of a Gaussian distribution, could replace the right-hand side of this inequality. This is especially significant since it implies, and is stronger than, Weyl's formulation of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle.
Tao's inequality
Given discrete random variables 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  takes values only in the interval [−1, 1] and 
 
 
 
  is determined by 
 
 
 
  (so that 
 
 
 
 ), we have1415



relating the conditional expectation to the conditional mutual information. This is a simple consequence of Pinsker's inequality. (Note: the correction factor log 2 inside the radical arises because we are measuring the conditional mutual information in bits rather than nats.)
