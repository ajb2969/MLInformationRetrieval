L-sorbose 1-dehydrogenase

L-sorbose 1-dehydrogenase (, SDH) is an enzyme with system name L-sorbose:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-sorbose + acceptor 
 
 
 
  1-dehydro-L-sorbose + reduced acceptor
 

The product, L-sorbosone, is an intermediate in bacterial 2-keto-L-gulonic-acid formation. Co2+ stimulate activity of this membrane-bound enzyme, while Cu2+ act as an inhibitor.
