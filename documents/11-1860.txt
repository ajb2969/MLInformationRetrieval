   Rules of passage (logic)      Rules of passage (logic)   In mathematical logic , the rules of passage govern how quantifiers distribute over the basic logical connectives of first-order logic . The rules of passage govern the "passage" (translation) from any formula of first-order logic to the equivalent formula in prenex normal form , and vice versa.  The rules  See Quine (1982: 119, chpt. 23). Let Q and Q 'denote ∀ and ∃ or vice versa. β denotes a closed formula in which x does not appear. The rules of passage then include the following sentences, whose main connective is the biconditional :         Q  x   [   ¬  α   (  x  )    ]    ↔   ¬   Q  ′   x   [   α   (  x  )    ]     .     normal-↔    Q  x   delimited-[]     α  x         superscript  Q  normal-′   x   delimited-[]    α  x       Qx[\lnot\alpha(x)]\leftrightarrow\lnot Q^{\prime}x[\alpha(x)].              Q   x   [   β  α   (  x  )    ]    ↔   (   β  Q  x  α   (  x  )    )    .     normal-↔    Q  x   delimited-[]    β  α  x       β  Q  x  α  x     \ Qx[\beta\alpha(x)]\leftrightarrow(\beta Qx\alpha(x)).              \exist   x   [   α   (  x  )   γ   (  x  )    ]    ↔   (    \exist   x  α   (  x  )    \exist   x  γ   (  x  )    )    .     normal-↔    \exist  x   delimited-[]    α  x  γ  x       \exist  x  α  x  \exist  x  γ  x     \exist x[\alpha(x)\gamma(x)]\leftrightarrow(\exist x\alpha(x)\exist x\gamma(x)).              Q   x   [   β  and  α   (  x  )    ]    ↔   (   β  and  Q  x  α   (  x  )    )    .     normal-↔    Q  x   delimited-[]    β  italic- and  α  x       β  italic- and  Q  x  α  x     \ Qx[\beta\and\alpha(x)]\leftrightarrow(\beta\and Qx\alpha(x)).             ∀    x    [    α   (  x  )    ∧   γ   (  x  )     ]     ↔   (    ∀    x   α   (  x  )     ∧   ∀    x   γ   (  x  )      )    .     normal-↔   for-all    x   delimited-[]      α  x     γ  x          for-all    x  α  x     for-all    x  γ  x       \forall x\,[\alpha(x)\land\gamma(x)]\leftrightarrow(\forall x\,\alpha(x)\land%
 \forall x\,\gamma(x)).      The following conditional sentences can also be taken as rules of passage:          \exist   x   [   α   (  x  )   and  γ   (  x  )    ]    →   (    \exist   x  α   (  x  )   and   \exist   x  γ   (  x  )    )    .     normal-→    \exist  x   delimited-[]    α  x  italic- and  γ  x       \exist  x  α  x  italic- and  \exist  x  γ  x     \exist x[\alpha(x)\and\gamma(x)]\rightarrow(\exist x\alpha(x)\and\exist x%
 \gamma(x)).           (   ∀    x   α   (  x  )    ∀    x   γ   (  x  )       )   →   ∀    x    [   α   (  x  )   γ   (  x  )    ]      .     normal-→   for-all    x  α  x   for-all    x  γ  x       for-all    x   delimited-[]    α  x  γ  x        (\forall x\,\alpha(x)\forall x\,\gamma(x))\rightarrow\forall x\,[\alpha(x)%
 \gamma(x)].           (   ∃    x   α   (  x  )   and   ∀    x   γ   (  x  )       )   →   ∃    x    [   α   (  x  )   and  γ   (  x  )    ]      .     normal-→      x  α  x  italic- and   for-all    x  γ  x          x   delimited-[]    α  x  italic- and  γ  x        (\exists x\,\alpha(x)\and\forall x\,\gamma(x))\rightarrow\exists x\,[\alpha(x)%
