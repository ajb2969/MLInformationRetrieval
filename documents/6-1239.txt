   Atriphtaloid      Atriphtaloid   An atriphtaloid , also called an atriphtothlassic curve , is type of sextic plane curve . It is given by the equation          x  4    (    x  2   +   y  2    )    -    (    a   x  2    -  b   )   2    =  0   ,           superscript  x  4      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      superscript      a   superscript  x  2    b   2    0    x^{4}(x^{2}+y^{2})-(ax^{2}-b)^{2}=0,\,   where a and b are positive numbers .
