L-rhamnono-1,4-lactonase

In enzymology, a L-rhamnono-1,4-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-rhamnono-1,4-lactone + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-rhamnonate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-rhamnono-1,4-lactone and H2O, whereas its product is L-rhamnonate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-rhamnono-1,4-lactone lactonohydrolase. Other names in common use include L-rhamno-gamma-lactonase, L-rhamnono-gamma-lactonase, and L-rhamnonate dehydratase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
