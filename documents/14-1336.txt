   Bender–Dunne polynomials      Bender–Dunne polynomials   In mathematics, Bender–Dunne polynomials are a two-parameter family of sequences of orthogonal polynomials studied by . They may be defined by the recursion:        P  0    (  x  )    =  1         subscript  P  0   x   1    P_{0}(x)=1   ,        P  1    (  x  )    =  x         subscript  P  1   x   x    P_{1}(x)=x   ,  and for    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   :        P  n    (  x  )    =    x   P   n  -  1     (  x  )    +   16   (   n  -  1   )    (   n  -  J  -  1   )    (    n  +   2  s    -  2   )    P   n  -  2     (  x  )            subscript  P  n   x       x   subscript  P    n  1    x     16    n  1     n  J  1       n    2  s    2    subscript  P    n  2    x      P_{n}(x)=xP_{n-1}(x)+16(n-1)(n-J-1)(n+2s-2)P_{n-2}(x)     where   J   J   J   and   s   s   s   are arbitrary parameters.
