Resolution inference

In propositional logic, a resolution inference is an instance of the following rule:1



We call:

The clauses 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the inference’s premises




 
  (the resolvent of the premises) is its conclusion.


The literal 
 
 
 
  is the left resolved literal,


The literal 
 
 
 
  is the right resolved literal,




 
  is the resolved atom or pivot.

This rule can be generalized to first-order logic to:2



where 
 
 
 
  is a most general unifier of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have no common variables.
Example
The clauses 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can apply this rule with 
 
 
 
  as unifier.
Here x is a variable and b is a constant.



Here we see that

The clauses 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the inference’s premises




 
  (the resolvent of the premises) is its conclusion.


The literal 
 
 
 
  is the left resolved literal,


The literal 
 
 
 
 
  is the right resolved literal,




 
  is the resolved atom or pivot.




 
  is the most general unifier of the resolved literals.
