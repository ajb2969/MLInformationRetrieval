   Gibbs state      Gibbs state   In probability theory and statistical mechanics , a Gibbs state is an equilibrium probability distribution which remains invariant under future evolution of the system. For example, a stationary or steady-state distribution of a Markov chain , such as that achieved by running a Markov chain Monte Carlo iteration for a sufficiently long time, is a Gibbs state.  Precisely, suppose    L    L   L\;   is a generator of evolutions for an initial state     ρ  0      subscript  ρ  0    \rho_{0}\;   , so that the state at any later time is given by     ρ   (  t  )    =    e   L  t     [   ρ  0   ]          ρ  t      superscript  e    L  t     delimited-[]   subscript  ρ  0       \rho(t)=e^{Lt}[\rho_{0}]\;   . Then the condition for     ρ  ∞      subscript  ρ     \rho_{\infty}\;   to be a Gibbs state is       L   [   ρ  ∞   ]    =  0        L   delimited-[]   subscript  ρ      0    L[\rho_{\infty}]=0   .  In physics there may be several physically distinct Gibbs states in which a system may be trapped, particularly at lower temperatures.  They are named after Josiah Willard Gibbs , for his work in determining equilibrium properties of statistical ensembles . Gibbs himself referred to this type of statistical ensemble as being in "statistical equilibrium". 1  See also   Gibbs algorithm  Gibbs measure   References  "  Category:Statistical mechanics  Category:Probability theory  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩
