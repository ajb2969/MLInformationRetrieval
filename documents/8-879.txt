   Spectral index      Spectral index   In astronomy , the spectral index of a source is a measure of the dependence of radiative flux density on frequency . Given frequency   ν   ν   \nu   and radiative flux    S   S   S   , the spectral index   α   α   \alpha   is given implicitly by       S  ∝   ν  α    .     proportional-to  S   superscript  ν  α     S\propto\nu^{\alpha}.   Note that if flux does not follow a power law in frequency, the spectral index itself is a function of frequency. Rearranging the above, we see that the spectral index is given by         α    (  ν  )    =      ∂  log    S     (  ν  )      ∂  log   ν     .        α  ν            S   ν        ν      \alpha\!\left(\nu\right)=\frac{\partial\log S\!\left(\nu\right)}{\partial\log%
 \nu}.     Spectral index is also sometimes defined in terms of wavelength    λ   λ   \lambda   . In this case, the spectral index   α   α   \alpha   is given implicitly by       S  ∝   λ  α    ,     proportional-to  S   superscript  λ  α     S\propto\lambda^{\alpha},   and at a given frequency, spectral index may be calculated by taking the derivative         α    (  λ  )    =      ∂  log    S     (  λ  )      ∂  log   λ     .        α  λ            S   λ        λ      \alpha\!\left(\lambda\right)=\frac{\partial\log S\!\left(\lambda\right)}{%
 \partial\log\lambda}.     The opposite sign convention is sometimes employed, 1 in which the spectral index is given by       S  ∝   ν   -  α     .     proportional-to  S   superscript  ν    α      S\propto\nu^{-\alpha}.     The spectral index of a source can hint at its properties. For example, using the positive sign convention, a spectral index of 0 to 2 at radio frequencies indicates thermal emission , while a steep negative spectral index typically indicates synchrotron emission .  Spectral Index of Thermal emission  At radio frequencies (i.e. in the low-frequency, long-wavelength limit), where the Rayleigh–Jeans law is a good approximation to the spectrum of thermal radiation , intensity is given by         B  ν    (  T  )    ≃    2   ν  2   k  T    c  2     .     similar-to-or-equals     subscript  B  ν   T       2   superscript  ν  2   k  T    superscript  c  2      B_{\nu}(T)\simeq\frac{2\nu^{2}kT}{c^{2}}.   Taking the logarithm of each side and taking the partial derivative with respect to     log   ν      ν    \log\,\nu   yields          ∂  log    B  ν     (  T  )      ∂  log   ν    ≃  2.     similar-to-or-equals            subscript  B  ν    T        ν    2.    \frac{\partial\log B_{\nu}(T)}{\partial\log\nu}\simeq 2.   Using the positive sign convention, the spectral index of thermal radiation is thus    α  ≃  2     similar-to-or-equals  α  2    \alpha\simeq 2   in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. The spectral index departs from this value at shorter wavelengths, for which the Rayleigh-Jeans law becomes an increasingly inaccurate approximation, tending towards zero as intensity reaches a peak at a frequency given by Wien's displacement law . Because of the simple temperature-dependence of radiative flux in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime, the radio spectral index is defined implicitly by 2       S  ∝    ν  α   T    .     proportional-to  S     superscript  ν  α   T     S\propto\nu^{\alpha}T.
