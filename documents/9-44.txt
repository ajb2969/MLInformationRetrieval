Energetic space

In mathematics, more precisely in functional analysis, an energetic space is, intuitively, a subspace of a given real Hilbert space equipped with a new "energetic" inner product. The motivation for the name comes from physics, as in many physical problems the energy of a system can be expressed in terms of the energetic inner product. An example of this will be given later in the article.
Energetic space
Formally, consider a real Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  with the inner product

 
  and the norm

 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a linear subspace of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a strongly monotone symmetric linear operator, that is, a linear operator satisfying



 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 



 
  for some constant 
 
 
 
  and all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 


The energetic inner product is defined as


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and the energetic norm is


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

The set 
 
 
 
  together with the energetic inner product is a pre-Hilbert space. The energetic space

 
  is defined as the completion of 
 
 
 
  in the energetic norm. 
 
 
 
  can be considered a subset of the original Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  since any Cauchy sequence in the energetic norm is also Cauchy in the norm of 
 
 
 
  (this follows from the strong monotonicity property of 
 
 
 
 ).
The energetic inner product is extended from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are sequences in Y that converge to points in 
 
 
 
  in the energetic norm.
Energetic extension
The operator 
 
 
 
  admits an energetic extension





defined on 
 
 
 
  with values in the dual space

 
  that is given by the formula


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 

Here, 
 
 
 
  denotes the duality bracket between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  so 
 
 
 
  actually denotes 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are elements in the original subspace 
 
 
 
  then



by the definition of the energetic inner product. If one views 
 
 
 
  which is an element in 
 
 
 
  as an element in the dual 
 
 
 
  via the Riesz representation theorem, then 
 
 
 
  will also be in the dual 
 
 
 
  (by the strong monotonicity property of 
 
 
 
 ). Via these identifications, it follows from the above formula that 
 
 
 
  In different words, the original operator 
 
 
 
  can be viewed as an operator 
 
 
 
  and then 
 
 
 
  is simply the function extension of 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 

An example from physics
 Consider a string whose endpoints are fixed at two points 
 
 

 
  on the string be 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a unit vector pointing vertically and 
 
 
 
  Let 
 
 
 
  be the deflection of the string at the point 
 
 
 
  under the influence of the force. Assuming that the deflection is small, the elastic energy of the string is



and the total potential energy of the string is



The deflection 
 
 
 
  minimizing the potential energy will satisfy the differential equation



with boundary conditions



To study this equation, consider the space 
 
 
 
  that is, the Lp space of all square integrable functions

 
  in respect to the Lebesgue measure. This space is Hilbert in respect to the inner product



with the norm being given by



Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of all twice continuously differentiable functions

 
  with the boundary conditionss

 
  Then 
 
 
 
  is a linear subspace of 
 
 

Consider the operator 
 
 
 
  given by the formula



so the deflection satisfies the equation 
 
 
 
  Using integration by parts and the boundary conditions, one can see that



for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  Therefore, 
 
 
 
  is a symmetric linear operator.


 
  is also strongly monotone, since, by the Friedrichs' inequality



for some 
 
 

The energetic space in respect to the operator 
 
 
 
  is then the Sobolev space

 
  We see that the elastic energy of the string which motivated this study is



so it is half of the energetic inner product of 
 
 
 
  with itself.
To calculate the deflection 
 
 
 
  minimizing the total potential energy 
 
 
 
  of the string, one writes this problem in the form


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
Next, one usually approximates 
 
 
 
  by some 
 
 
 
 , a function in a finite-dimensional subspace of the true solution space. For example, one might let 
 
 
 
  be a continuous piecewise-linear function in the energetic space, which gives the finite element method. The approximation 
 
 
 
  can be computed by solving a linear system of equations.
The energetic norm turns out to be the natural norm in which to measure the error between 
 
 
 
  and $u_h$, see CÃ©a's lemma.
