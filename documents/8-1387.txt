   Pfister form      Pfister form   In mathematics , a Pfister form is a particular kind of quadratic form over a field  F (whose characteristic is usually assumed to be not 2), introduced by Albrecht Pfister in 1965. A Pfister form is in 2 n variables, for some natural number n (also called an n-Pfister form ), and may be written as a tensor product of quadratic forms as:        ⟨   ⟨   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  n   ⟩   ⟩   ≅    ⟨  1  ,   a  1   ⟩   ⊗   ⟨  1  ,   a  2   ⟩   ⊗  …  ⊗   ⟨  1  ,   a  n   ⟩     ,       delimited-⟨⟩    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  n      tensor-product   1   subscript  a  1     1   subscript  a  2    normal-…   1   subscript  a  n       \langle\!\langle a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}\rangle\!\rangle\cong\langle 1,a_{1}%
 \rangle\otimes\langle 1,a_{2}\rangle\otimes...\otimes\langle 1,a_{n}\rangle,     for a i elements of the field F . An n -Pfister form may also be constructed inductively from an ( n -1)-Pfister form q and an element a of F , as    q  ⊕    (  a  )   q      direct-sum  q    a  q     q\oplus(a)q   .  So all 1-Pfister forms and 2-Pfister forms look like:       ⟨   ⟨  a  ⟩   ⟩   ≅   ⟨  1  ,  a  ⟩   ≅    x  2   +   a   y  2            delimited-⟨⟩   delimited-⟨⟩  a     1  a           superscript  x  2     a   superscript  y  2        \langle\!\langle a\rangle\!\rangle\cong\langle 1,a\rangle\cong x^{2}+ay^{2}   .        ⟨   ⟨  a  ,  b  ⟩   ⟩   ≅   ⟨  1  ,  a  ,  b  ,   a  b   ⟩   ≅    x  2   +   a   y  2    +   b   z  2    +   a  b   w  2      .         delimited-⟨⟩   a  b     1  a  b    a  b            superscript  x  2     a   superscript  y  2      b   superscript  z  2      a  b   superscript  w  2        \langle\!\langle a,b\rangle\!\rangle\cong\langle 1,a,b,ab\rangle\cong x^{2}+ay%
 ^{2}+bz^{2}+abw^{2}.     For n ≤ 3 the n -Pfister forms are norm forms of composition algebras . 1 In fact, in this case, two n -Pfister forms are isometric if and only if the corresponding composition algebras are isomorphic .  The Pfister forms are generators for the torsion in the Witt group . 2 The n -fold forms additively generate the n -th power I n of the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring. 3  Characterisation  We define a quadratic form q over a field F to be multiplicative if when x and y are vectors of indeterminates, then q ( x ). q ( y ) = q ( z ) where z is a vector of rational functions in the x and y over F . Isotropic quadratic forms are multiplicative. 4 For anisotropic quadratic forms , Pfister forms are multiplicative and conversely. 5 6  Connection with K-theory  Let k n ( F ) be the n -th group in Milnor K-theory modulo 2. There are homomorphisms from k n ( F ) to the Witt ring by taking the symbol        {   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  n   }   ↦   ⟨   ⟨   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  n   ⟩   ⟩    ,     maps-to    subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  n     delimited-⟨⟩    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  n       \{a_{1},\ldots,a_{n}\}\mapsto\langle\!\langle a_{1},a_{2},...,a_{n}\rangle\!\rangle,     where the image is an n -fold Pfister form  . 7 The image can be taken as I n / I n +1 and the map is surjective since the Pfister forms additively generate I n . The Milnor conjecture can be interpreted as stating that these maps are isomorphisms. 8  Pfister neighbours  A Pfister neighbour is a form ( W ,σ) such that ( W ,σ) is similar to a subspace of a space with Pfister form ( V ,φ) where dim. V Lam (2005) p.339 The associated Pfister form φ is uniquely determined by σ. Any ternary form is a Pfister neighbour; a quaternary form is a Pfister neighbour if and only if its discriminant is a square. 9 A degree five form is a Pfister neighbour if and only if the underlying field is a linked field . 10  Notes  References    , Ch. 10    Further reading     "  Category:Quadratic forms     Lam (2005) p.316 ↩  Lam (2005) p.395 ↩  Lam (2005) p.316 ↩  Lam (2005) p.324 ↩  Lam (2005) p.325 ↩  Rajwade (1993) p.164 ↩  Lam (2005) p.366 ↩   Lam (2005) p.341 ↩  Lam (2005) p.342 ↩
