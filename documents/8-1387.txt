Pfister form

In mathematics, a Pfister form is a particular kind of quadratic form over a field F (whose characteristic is usually assumed to be not 2), introduced by Albrecht Pfister in 1965. A Pfister form is in 2n variables, for some natural number n (also called an n-Pfister form), and may be written as a tensor product of quadratic forms as:



for ai elements of the field F. An n-Pfister form may also be constructed inductively from an (n-1)-Pfister form q and an element a of F, as 
 
 
 
 .
So all 1-Pfister forms and 2-Pfister forms look like:


 
 .



For n ≤ 3 the n-Pfister forms are norm forms of composition algebras.1 In fact, in this case, two n-Pfister forms are isometric if and only if the corresponding composition algebras are isomorphic.
The Pfister forms are generators for the torsion in the Witt group.2 The n-fold forms additively generate the n-th power In of the fundamental ideal of the Witt ring.3
Characterisation
We define a quadratic form q over a field F to be multiplicative if when x and y are vectors of indeterminates, then q(x).q(y) = q(z) where z is a vector of rational functions in the x and y over F. Isotropic quadratic forms are multiplicative.4 For anisotropic quadratic forms, Pfister forms are multiplicative and conversely.56
Connection with K-theory
Let kn(F) be the n-th group in Milnor K-theory modulo 2. There are homomorphisms from kn(F) to the Witt ring by taking the symbol



where the image is an n-fold Pfister form
.7 The image can be taken as In/In+1 and the map is surjective since the Pfister forms additively generate In. The Milnor conjecture can be interpreted as stating that these maps are isomorphisms.8
Pfister neighbours
A Pfister neighbour is a form (W,σ) such that (W,σ) is similar to a subspace of a space with Pfister form (V,φ) where dim.V Lam (2005) p.339 The associated Pfister form φ is uniquely determined by σ. Any ternary form is a Pfister neighbour; a quaternary form is a Pfister neighbour if and only if its discriminant is a square.9 A degree five form is a Pfister neighbour if and only if the underlying field is a linked field.10
