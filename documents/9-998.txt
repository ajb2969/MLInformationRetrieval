   Epsilon-equilibrium      Epsilon-equilibrium   In game theory , an epsilon-equilibrium , or near-Nash equilibrium, is a strategy profile that approximately satisfies the condition of Nash equilibrium . In a Nash equilibrium, no player has an incentive to change his behavior. In an approximate Nash equilibrium, this requirement is weakened to allow the possibility that a player may have a small incentive to do something different. This may still be considered an adequate solution concept, assuming for example status quo bias . This solution concept may be preferred to Nash equilibrium due to being easier to compute, or alternatively due to the possibility that in games of more than 2 players, the probabilities involved in an exact Nash equilibrium need not be rational numbers . 1  Definition  There is more than one alternative definition.  The standard definition  Given a game and a real non-negative parameter   ε   ε   \varepsilon   , a strategy profile is said to be an   ε   ε   \varepsilon   -equilibrium if it is not possible for any player to gain more than   ε   ε   \varepsilon   in expected payoff by unilaterally deviating from his strategy 2 Every Nash Equilibrium is equivalent to an   ε   ε   \varepsilon   -equilibrium where    ε  =  0      ε  0    \varepsilon=0   .  Formally, let    G  =   (  N  ,  A  =   A  1   ×  ⋯  ×   A  N   ,  u  :  A  →   R  N   )      fragments  G    fragments  normal-(  N  normal-,  A    subscript  A  1    normal-⋯    subscript  A  N   normal-,  u  normal-:  A  normal-→   superscript  R  N   normal-)     G=(N,A=A_{1}\times\cdots\times A_{N},u\colon A\to R^{N})   be an   N   N   N   -player game with action sets    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   for each player   i   i   i   and utility function   u   u   u   . Let     u  i    (  s  )        subscript  u  i   s    u_{i}(s)   denote the payoff to player   i   i   i   when strategy profile    s   s   s   is played. Let    Δ  i     subscript  normal-Δ  i    \Delta_{i}   be the space of probability distributions over    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   . A vector of strategies    σ  ∈  Δ  =    Δ  1   ×  ⋯  ×   Δ  N          σ  normal-Δ          subscript  normal-Δ  1   normal-⋯   subscript  normal-Δ  N       \sigma\in\Delta=\Delta_{1}\times\cdots\times\Delta_{N}   is an   ε   ε   \varepsilon   -Nash Equilibrium for   G   G   G   if        u  i    (  σ  )    ≥     u  i    (   σ  i    ′    ,   σ   -  i    )    -  ε          subscript  u  i   σ        subscript  u  i     superscript   subscript  σ  i    normal-′     subscript  σ    i      ε     u_{i}(\sigma)\geq u_{i}(\sigma_{i}^{^{\prime}},\sigma_{-i})-\varepsilon   for all       σ  i    ′    ∈   Δ  i    ,   i  ∈  N    .     formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  σ  i    normal-′     subscript  normal-Δ  i      i  N     \sigma_{i}^{^{\prime}}\in\Delta_{i},i\in N.     Well-supported approximate equilibrium  The following definition 3 imposes the stronger requirement that a player may only assign positive probability to a pure strategy   a   a   a   if the payoff of   a   a   a   has expected payoff at most   ε   ε   \varepsilon   less than the best response payoff. Let    x  s     subscript  x  s    x_{s}   be the probability that strategy profile   s   s   s   is played. For player   p   p   p   let    S   -  p      subscript  S    p     S_{-p}   be strategy profiles of players other than   p   p   p   ; for    s  ∈   S   -  p        s   subscript  S    p      s\in S_{-p}   and a pure strategy   j   j   j   of   p   p   p   let    j  s      j  s    js   be the strategy profile where   p   p   p   plays   j   j   j   and other players play   s   s   s   . Let     u  p    (  s  )        subscript  u  p   s    u_{p}(s)   be the payoff to   p   p   p   when strategy profile   s   s   s   is used. The requirement can be expressed by the formula        ∑   s  ∈   S   -  p        u  p    (   j  s   )    x  s     >   ε  +    ∑   s  ∈   S   -  p        u  p    (    j  ′   s   )    x  s      ⟹   x   j  ′   p   =  0.          subscript     s   subscript  S    p         subscript  u  p     j  s    subscript  x  s       ε    subscript     s   subscript  S    p         subscript  u  p      superscript  j  normal-′   s    subscript  x  s        normal-⟹     subscript   superscript  x  p    superscript  j  normal-′         0.     \sum_{s\in S_{-p}}u_{p}(js)x_{s}>\varepsilon+\sum_{s\in S_{-p}}u_{p}(j^{\prime%

Results  The existence of a polynomial-time approximation scheme (PTAS) for ε-Nash equilibria is equivalent to the question of whether there exists one for ε-well-supported approximate Nash equilibria, 4 but the existence of a PTAS remains an open problem. For constant values of ε, polynomial-time algorithms for approximate equilibria are known for lower values of ε than are known for well-supported approximate equilibria. For games with payoffs in the range [0,1] and ε=0.3393, ε-Nash equilibria can be computed in polynomial time 5 For games with payoffs in the range [0,1] and ε=2/3, ε-well-supported equilibria can be computed in polynomial time 6  Example  The notion of ε-equilibria is important in the theory of stochastic games of potentially infinite duration. There are simple examples of stochastic games with no Nash equilibrium but with an ε-equilibrium for any ε strictly bigger than 0.  Perhaps the simplest such example is the following variant of Matching Pennies , suggested by Everett. Player 1 hides a penny and Player 2 must guess if it is heads up or tails up. If Player 2 guesses correctly, he wins the penny from Player 1 and the game ends. If Player 2 incorrectly guesses that the penny is heads up, the game ends with payoff zero to both players. If he incorrectly guesses that it is tails up, the game repeats . If the play continues forever, the payoff to both players is zero.  Given a parameter ε > 0, any strategy profile where Player 2 guesses heads up with probability ε and tails up with probability 1-ε (at every stage of the game, and independently from previous stages) is an ε-equilibrium for the game. The expected payoff of Player 2 in such a strategy profile is at least 1-ε. However, it is easy to see that there is no strategy for Player 2 that can guarantee an expected payoff of exactly 1. Therefore, the game has no Nash equilibrium .  Another simple example is the finitely repeated prisoner's dilemma for T periods, where the payoff is averaged over the T periods. The only Nash equilibrium of this game is to choose Defect in each period. Now consider the two strategies tit-for-tat and grim trigger . Although neither tit-for-tat nor grim trigger are Nash equilibria for the game, both of them are   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   -equilibria for some positive   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   . The acceptable values of   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   depend on the payoffs of the constituent game and on the number T of periods.  In Economics, the concept of a Pure strategy epsilon-equilibrium is used when the mixed-strategy approach is seen as unrealistic. In a pure-strategy epsilon-equilibrium, each player chooses a pure-strategy that is within epsilon of its best pure-strategy. For example, in the Bertrand-Edgeworth model , where no pure-strategy equilibrium exists, a pure-strategy epsilon equilibrium may exist.
