Helicity basis




Helicity basis

In the Standard Model, using quantum field theory it is conventional to use the helicity basis to simplify calculations (of cross sections, for example). In this basis, the spin is quantized along the axis in the direction of motion of the particle.
Spinors
The two-component helicity eigenstates

 
  satisfy







where
 


 
  are the Pauli matrices,
 


 
  is the direction of the fermion momentum,
 


 
  depending on whether spin is pointing in the same direction as 
 
 
 
  or opposite.
 

To say more about the state, 
 
 
 
  we will use the generic form of fermion four-momentum:








Then one can say the two helicity eigenstates are






\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 |\vec{p}|(|\vec{p}| + p_z)}} \begin{pmatrix} |\vec{p}|+p_z\\ p_x+i p_y \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}}\\ e^{i\phi}\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}} \end{pmatrix}\, and






\frac{1}{\sqrt{2 |\vec{p}|(|\vec{p}| + p_z)}} \begin{pmatrix} -p_x+i p_y\\ |\vec{p}|+p_z \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} -e^{-i\phi}\sin{\frac{\theta}{2}}\\ \cos{\frac{\theta}{2}} \end{pmatrix}\,
These can be simplified by defining the z-axis such that the momentum direction is either parallel or anti-parallel, or rather:




 
 .
 



In this situation the helicity eigenstates are for when the particle momentum is 
 
 







1\\ 0 \end{pmatrix} \, and 
 
 
 
  for then for when momentum is 
 
 







0\\ 1 \end{pmatrix} \, and 
 
 

Fermion (spin 1/2) wavefunction
A fermion 4-component wave function, 
 
 
 
  may be decomposed into states with definite four-momentum:







where
 
 

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the Creation and annihilation operators, and


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the momentum-space Dirac spinors for a fermion and anti-fermion respectively.


Put it more explicitly, the Dirac spinors in the helicity basis for a fermion is






u_{-1}\\ u_{+1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} \sqrt{E-\lambda |\vec{p}|} \chi_\lambda(\hat{p}) \\ \sqrt{E+\lambda |\vec{p}|} \chi_\lambda(\hat{p}) \end{pmatrix} \, and for an anti-fermion,






v_{-1}\\ v_{+1} \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} -\lambda \sqrt{E+\lambda |\vec{p}|} \chi_{-\lambda}(\hat{p}) \\ \lambda \sqrt{E-\lambda |\vec{p}|} \chi_{-\lambda}(\hat{p}) \end{pmatrix} \,
Dirac matrices
To use these helicity states, one can use the Weyl (chiral) representation for the Dirac matrices.

For a Vector boson with mass 'm' and a four-momentum

 
  the polarization vectors quantized with respect to its momentum direction can be defined as
::{| |
 
 
 
  |
 
 
 
  |- |
 
 
 
  |
 
 
 
  |- |
 
 
 
  |
 
 
 
  |}

where
 
 

 
  is transverse momentum, and


 
  is the energy of the boson.
