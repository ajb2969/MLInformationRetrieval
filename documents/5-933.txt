   Mean motion      Mean motion   In orbital mechanics , mean motion (represented by   n   n   n\,\!   ) is a measure of how fast a satellite progresses around its elliptical orbit . The mean motion is the time-average angular velocity over an orbit. In particular for circular orbits , the angular velocity is constant, and so it equals the mean motion.  In databases of satellite orbital parameters the mean motion is typically measured in number of revolutions per day .  Calculation      n  =     G   (    M   +  m   )     a  3         n        G    M  m     superscript  a  3       n=\sqrt{\frac{G(M\!+\!m)}{a^{3}}}\,\!     For satellite orbital parameters:      n  =   d     G   (    M   +  m   )     4   π  2    a  3           n    d        G    M  m      4   superscript  π  2    superscript  a  3         n=d\sqrt{\frac{G(M\!+\!m)}{4\pi^{2}a^{3}}}\,\!     where:       d    d   d\!   is quantity of time in a day .      G    G   G\!   is the gravitational constant ,      M    M   M\!   and    m    m   m\!   are the masses of the orbiting bodies,      a    a   a\!   is semi-major axis .   Related formulae  The mean motion has a unit of radian or degrees per unit time      n  =    2  π   P       n      2  π   P     n=\frac{2\pi}{P}     The mean motion for satellite orbital parameters is a ratio and thus have no units      n  =   d  P       n    d  P     n=\frac{d}{P}     where d is the amount of time in a day and P is the orbital period .  Or,      n  =     M  1   -   M  0    t       n       subscript  M  1    subscript  M  0    t     n=\frac{M_{1}-M_{0}}{t}     where M 1 and M 0 are the mean anomalies at particular points in time, and t is the time elapsed between the two. M 0 is referred to as the mean anomaly at epoch , and t the time since epoch .  See also   Kepler orbit  Mean anomaly  Elliptic coordinates   "  Category:Orbits
