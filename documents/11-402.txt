1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine esterase

In enzymology, a 1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerophosphocholine esterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and H2O, whereas its two products are 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acetohydrolase. Other names in common use include 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine acetylhydrolase, and alkylacetyl-GPC:acetylhydrolase. This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism.
