   Cis-3,4-dihydrophenanthrene-3,4-diol dehydrogenase      Cis-3,4-dihydrophenanthrene-3,4-diol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cis-3,4-dihydrophenanthrene-3,4-diol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (+)-cis-3,4-dihydrophenanthrene-3,4-diol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phenanthrene-3,4-diol + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (+)-cis-3,4-dihydrophenanthrene-3,4-diol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are phenanthrene-3,4-diol , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+)-cis-3,4-dihydrophenanthrene-3,4-diol:NAD+ 3,4-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in naphthalene and anthracene degradation .
