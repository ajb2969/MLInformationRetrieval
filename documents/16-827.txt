Albert van den Berg (physicist)

Albert van den Berg (born 20 September 1957 in Zaandam) is a Dutch physicist who works on nanotechnology-miniaturization in physics, chemistry, biology and biotechnology (nanofluidics, nanosensors, Lab on a chip (LOC)).
In 1988 van den Berg earned his PhD at the University of Twente with a thesis on chemically modified ISFETs. Then until 1993 he worked at the Centre Suisse d’Electronique et de Microtechnique (CSEM) in Neuchâtel and the Institut de microtechnique (IMT) at the University of Neuchâtel. During this time he worked mainly on miniaturized chemical sensors. From 1993 to 1999 he was director of research for Micro Total Analysis Systems (
 
 
 
 TAS, i.e. miniaturized systems for chemical analysis) and Miniaturized Chemical Systems (MiCS) at the Institute for Nanotechnology (MESA+) at the University of Twente.1 In 1998 he had a part-time professorship and from 2000 a full professorship. In 2003 he became head of nanofluidics within the Dutch national nanotechnology program (NanoNed). Van den Berg has co-authored over 250 scientific publications (H=44) and over 10 patents. He is or has been involved with 6 spin-off companies.2
In 2002 he won the Simon Stevin Master Award of the Dutch Society of Science and Engineering. In 2009 he won the Spinoza Prize,3 the most prestigious Dutch science prize. As there was no fourth Spinoza Prize awarded in 2009, Van den Berg and his co-winners Michel Ferrari and Marten Scheffer asked the NWO to reward them the remaining prize money, which they would spend on a colloborative research effort.4 Their efforts culminated in a research paper on migraine published in PLOS ONE in 2013.567 The paper claimed that a critical tipping point of neurons started a migraine attack.8
He is a member of the Royal Dutch Academy of Sciences and its council.91011
