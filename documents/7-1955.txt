't Hooft symbol

The 't Hooft η symbol is a symbol which allows one to express the generators of the SU(2) Lie algebra in terms of the generators of Lorentz algebra. The symbol is a blend between the Kronecker delta and the Levi-Civita symbol. It was introduced by Gerard 't Hooft. It is used in the construction of the BPST instanton.
ηaμν is the 't Hooft symbol:



In other words they are defined by

The (anti)self-duality properties are



Some other properties are















The same holds for 
 
 
 
  except for



and



Obviously 
 
 
 
  due to different duality properties.
Many properties of these are tabulated in the appendix of 't Hooft's paper1 and also in the article by Belitsky et al.2
