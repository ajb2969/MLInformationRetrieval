   Stagnation pressure      Stagnation pressure   In fluid dynamics , stagnation pressure (or pitot pressure ) is the static pressure at a stagnation point in a fluid flow. 1 At a stagnation point the fluid velocity is zero and all kinetic energy has been converted into pressure energy (isentropically). Stagnation pressure is equal to the sum of the free-stream dynamic pressure and free-stream static pressure. 2  Stagnation pressure is sometimes referred to as pitot pressure because it is measured using a pitot tube .  Magnitude  The magnitude of stagnation pressure can be derived from a simplified form of Bernoulli Equation . 3 4 For incompressible flow ,       P  stagnation   =      1  2    ρ   v  2    +   P  static         subscript  P  stagnation         1  2   ρ   superscript  v  2     subscript  P  static      P_{\text{stagnation}}=\tfrac{1}{2}\rho v^{2}+P_{\text{static}}     where:      P  stagnation     subscript  P  stagnation    P_{\text{stagnation}}   is the stagnation pressure      ρ    ρ   \rho\;   is the fluid density     v   v   v   is the velocity of fluid      P  static     subscript  P  static    P_{\text{static}}   is the static pressure at any point.  At a stagnation point, the velocity of the fluid is zero. If the gravity head of the fluid at a particular point in a fluid flow is zero, then the stagnation pressure at that particular point is equal to total pressure . 5 However, in general total pressure differs from stagnation pressure in that total pressure equals the sum of stagnation pressure and gravity head.       P  total   =   0  +    P  stagnation          subscript  P  total     0   subscript  P  stagnation      P_{\text{total}}=0+P_{\text{stagnation}}\;     In compressible flow the stagnation pressure is equal to static pressure only if the fluid entering the stagnation point is brought to rest isentropically . 6 For many purposes in compressible flow, the stagnation enthalpy or stagnation temperature plays a role similar to the stagnation pressure in incompressible flow.  Compressible flow  Stagnation pressure is the static pressure a fluid retains when brought to rest isentropically from Mach number  M . 7        p  t   p   =     (   1  +     γ  -  1   2    M  2     )    γ   γ  -  1             subscript  p  t   p    superscript    1        γ  1   2    superscript  M  2       γ    γ  1       \frac{p_{t}}{p}=\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^{2}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1%
 }}\,     or, assuming an isentropic process, the stagnation pressure can be calculated from the ratio of stagnation temperature to static temperature:        p  t   p   =     (    T  t   T   )    γ   γ  -  1             subscript  p  t   p    superscript     subscript  T  t   T     γ    γ  1       \frac{p_{t}}{p}=\left(\frac{T_{t}}{T}\right)^{\frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1}}\,     where:      p  t     subscript  p  t    p_{t}   is the stagnation pressure     p   p   p   is the static pressure      T  t     subscript  T  t    T_{t}   is the stagnation temperature     T   T   T   is the static temperature     γ   γ   \gamma   ratio of specific heats  The above derivation holds only for the case when the fluid is assumed to be calorically perfect. For such fluids, specific heats and   γ   γ   \gamma   are assumed to be constant and invariant with temperature (a thermally perfect fluid).
