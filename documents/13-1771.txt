In the mathematical area of knot theory, the unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of times the knot must be passed through itself (crossing switch) to untie it. If a knot has unknotting number 
 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a diagram of the knot which can be changed to unknot by switching 
 
 
 
  crossings.1 The unknotting number of a knot is always less than half of its crossing number.2
Any composite knot has unknotting number at least two, and therefore every knot with unknotting number one is a prime knot. The following table show the unknotting numbers for the first few knots:

In general, it is relatively difficult to determine the unknotting number of a given knot. Known cases include:

The unknotting number of a nontrivial twist knot is always equal to one.
The unknotting number of a 
 
 
 
 -torus knot is equal to 
 
 
 
 .
The unknotting numbers of prime knots with nine or fewer crossings have all been determined.3 (The unknotting number of the 1011 prime knot is unknown.)
