   Unknotting number      Unknotting number   (Figure)  Trefoil knot without 3-fold symmetry being unknotted by one crossing switch.   In the mathematical area of knot theory , the unknotting number of a knot is the minimum number of times the knot must be passed through itself ( crossing switch ) to untie it. If a knot has unknotting number   n   n   n   , then there exists a diagram of the knot which can be changed to unknot by switching   n   n   n   crossings. 1 The unknotting number of a knot is always less than half of its crossing number . 2  Any composite knot has unknotting number at least two, and therefore every knot with unknotting number one is a prime knot . The following table show the unknotting numbers for the first few knots:  Image:Blue Trefoil Knot.png| Trefoil knot unknotting number 1 Image:Blue Figure-Eight Knot.png| Figure-eight knot unknotting number 1 Image:Blue Cinquefoil Knot.png| Cinquefoil knot unknotting number 2 Image:Blue Three-Twist Knot.png| Three-twist knot unknotting number 1 Image:Blue Stevedore Knot.png| Stevedore knot unknotting number 1 Image:Blue 6_2 Knot.png| 6₂ knot unknotting number 1 Image:Blue 6_3 Knot.png| 6₃ knot unknotting number 1 Image:Blue 7_1 Knot.png| 7₁ knot unknotting number 3  In general, it is relatively difficult to determine the unknotting number of a given knot. Known cases include:   The unknotting number of a nontrivial twist knot is always equal to one.  The unknotting number of a    (  p  ,  q  )     p  q    (p,q)   - torus knot is equal to      (   p  -  1   )    (   q  -  1   )    /  2          p  1     q  1    2    (p-1)(q-1)/2   .  The unknotting numbers of prime knots with nine or fewer crossings have all been determined. 3 (The unknotting number of the 10 11 prime knot is unknown.)
