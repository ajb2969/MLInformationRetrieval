   D-alanine—poly(phosphoribitol) ligase      D-alanine—poly(phosphoribitol) ligase   In enzymology , a D-alanine—poly(phosphoribitol) ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + D-alanine + poly(ribitol phosphate)   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + O-D-alanyl-poly(ribitol phosphate)   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , D-alanine , and poly(ribitol phosphate) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and O-D-alanyl-poly(ribitol phosphate) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-alanine:poly(phosphoribitol) ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include D-alanyl-poly(phosphoribitol) synthetase , D-alanine: membrane acceptor ligase , D-alanine-D-alanyl carrier protein ligase , D-alanine-membrane acceptor ligase , and D-alanine-activating enzyme . This enzyme participates in d-alanine metabolism .  References         "  Category:EC 6.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
