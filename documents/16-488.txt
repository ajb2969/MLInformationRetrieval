Two-ray ground-reflection model

2-ray Ground Reflected Model is a radio propagation model that predicts path loss when the signal received consists of the line of sight component and multi path component formed predominately by a single ground reflected wave. 
Mathematical Derivation
From the figure the received line of sight component may be written as



and the ground reflected component may be written as



where 
 
 
 
  is the transmitted signal 
 
 
 
  is ground reflection co-efficient and 
 
 
 
  is the delay spread of the model and equals

 , therefore, the path difference between them


 
  and the phase difference between the waves is



The power of the signal received is



If the signal is narrow band relative to the delay spread 
 
 
 
 , the power equation 
 
 
 
  may be simplified to


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the transmitted power.
When distance between the antennas 
 
 
 
  is very large relative to the height of the antenna we may expand 
 
 
 
  using Generalized Binomial Theorem



Using the Taylor series of

  and taking the first two terms



Phase difference may be approximated as

Expanding 
 
 
 
 using Taylor series


 
  and retaining only the first two terms






Taking the magnitude



Power varies with inverse fourth power of distance for large

Power vs. Distance Characteristics
 When d is small compared to transmitter height two waves add constructively to yield higher power and as d increases these waves add up constructively and destructively giving regions of up-fade and down-fade as d increases beyond the critical distance or first Fresnel zone power drops proportional to inverse fourth power of d. An approximation to critical distance may be obtained by setting Δφ to π as critical distance a local maximum.
As a case of log distance path loss model
The standard expression of Log distance path loss model is


 
  The path loss of 2-ray ground reflected wave is

  the critical distance.
As a case of multi-slope model
The 2-ray ground reflected model may be thought as a case of multi-slope model with break point at critical distance with slope 20 dB/decade before critical distance and slope of 40 dB/decade after the critical distance.
