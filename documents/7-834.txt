Composition algebra

In mathematics, a composition algebra $A$ over a field $K$ is a not necessarily associative algebra over $K$ together with a nondegenerate quadratic form $N$ which satisfies
$$N(xy) = N(x)N(y)$$ for all $x$ and $y$ in $A$.  Unital composition algebras are called Hurwitz algebras.1 If the ground field $ K$ is the field of real numbers and $N$ is positive-definite, then $A$ is called an Euclidean Hurwitz algebra.
The quadratic form $N$ is often referred to as a norm on $A$.  Composition algebras are also called normed algebras: these should not be confused with associative normed algebras, which include Banach algebras, although three associative Euclidean Hurwitz algebras $\mathbf{ R } $, $\mathbf{ C } $, and $\mathbf{ H } $ in fact are Banach algebras.
Structure theorem
Every unital composition algebra over a field $K$ can be obtained by repeated application of the Cayley–Dickson construction starting from $K$ (if the characteristic of $K$ is different from 2) or a 2-dimensional composition subalgebra (if $char( K ) = 2$).  The possible dimensions of a composition algebra are 1, 2, 4, and 8.2

1-dimensional composition algebras only exist when $char( K ) ≠ 2$.
Composition algebras of dimension 1 and 2 are commutative and associative.
Composition algebras of dimension 2 are either quadratic field extensions of $K$ or isomorphic to $K ⊕ K$.
Composition algebras of dimension 4 are called quaternion algebras.  They are associative but not commutative.
Composition algebras of dimension 8 are called octonion algebras.  They are neither associative nor commutative.

The case char(K) ≠ 2
Scalar product
If $K$ has characteristic not equal to 2, then a bilinear form $( a , b ) = \frac{1}{2} N N ( a + b ) − N ( a ) − N ( b )$ is associated with the quadratic form $N$.
Involution in Hurwitz algebras
Assuming $A$ has a multiplicative unity, define involution and right and left multiplication operators by
$$\displaystyle{\bar a=-a +2(a,1)1,\,\,\, L(a)b = ab,\,\,\, R(a)b=ba.}$$
Evidently $\overline$ is an involution and preserves the quadratic form. The overline notation stresses the fact that complex and quaternion conjugation are partial cases of it. These operators have the following properties:

The involution is an antiautomorphism, i.e. $ \overline{a b} = \overline{b} \overline{a}$
$ a \overline{a} = N ( a ) 1 = \overline{a} a$
$ L ( \overline{a} ) = L ( a )*$, $ R ( \overline{a} ) = R ( a )*$, where $*$ denotes the adjoint operator with respect to the form $( , )$
$Re( a b ) = Re( b a )$ where $Re x = ( x + \overline{x} )/2 = ( x , 1)$
$Re(( a b ) c ) = Re( a ( b c ))$
, , so that $A$ is an alternating algebra

These properties are proved starting from polarized version of the identity $( a b , a b ) = ( a , a )( b , b )$:
$$\displaystyle{2(a,b)(c,d)=(ac,bd) + (ad,bc).}$$
Setting $ b = 1$ or $ d = 1$ yields $ L ( \overline{a} ) = L ( a )*$ and $ R ( \overline{c} ) = R ( c )*$. Hence $Re( a b ) = ( a b , 1) = ( a , \overline{b} ) = ( b a , 1) = Re( b a )$. Similarly $( \overline{a b} , c ) = ( a b , \overline{c} ) = ( b , \overline{a} \overline{c} ) = (1, \overline{b} ( \overline{a} \overline{c} )) = (1, ( \overline{b} \overline{a} ) \overline{c} ) = ( \overline{b} \overline{a} , c )$. Hence $Re( a b ) c = (( a b ) c , 1) = ( a b , \overline{c} ) = ( a , \overline{c} \overline{b} ) = ( a ( b c ), 1) = Re( a ( b c ))$. By the polarized identity $ N ( a ) ( c , d ) = ( a c , a d ) = ( \overline{a} a c , d )$ so $ L ( \overline{a} ) L( a ) = N ( a )$. Applied to 1 this gives $ \overline{a} a = N ( a )$. Replacing $a$ by $\overline{a}{class=texhtml}$ gives the other identity. Substituting the formula for $\overline{a}$ in $ L ( \overline{a} ) L ( a ) = L ( \overline{a} a )$ gives .
Para-Hurwitz algebra
Another operation $∗$ may be defined in a Hurwitz algebra as

$ x ∗ y = \overline{x} \overline{y}$


The algebra $( A , ∗)$ is a composition algebra not generally unital, known as a para-Hurwitz algebra.3 In dimensions 4 and 8 these are para-quaternion4 and para-octonion algebras.5
A para-Hurwitz algebra satisfies6
$$(x * y ) * x = x * (y * x) = \langle x|x \rangle y \ .$$
Conversely, an algebra with a non-degenerate symmetric bilinear form satisfying this equation is either a para-Hurwitz algebra or an eight-dimensional pseudo-octonion algebra.7 Similarly, a flexible algebra satisfying
$$\langle xy | xy \rangle = \langle x|x \rangle \langle y|y \rangle \$$
is either a Hurwitz algebra, a para-Hurwitz algebra or an eight-dimensional pseudo-octonion algebra.8
Euclidean Hurwitz algebras
If the underlying coefficient field of a Hurwitz algebra is the reals and $q$ is positive-definite, so that $( a , b ) = \frac{1}{2} q q ( a + b ) − q ( a ) − q ( b )$ is an inner product, then $A$ is called a Euclidean Hurwitz algebra. The Euclidean Hurwitz algebras are precisely the real numbers, the complex numbers, the quaternions and the octonions.9
Instances and usage
When the field $K$ is taken to be complex numbers $\mathbf{ C } $, then the four composition algebras over $\mathbf{ C } $ are $\mathbf{ C } itself$, the direct sum $\mathbf{ C } ⊕ \mathbf{ C } $ known first as tessarines (1848), the  complex matrix ring $M(2, \mathbf{ C } )$, and the complex octonions $\mathbf{ CO } $.
Matrix ring $M(2, \mathbf{ C } )$ has long been an object of interest, first as biquaternions by Hamilton (1853), later in the isomorphic matrix form, and especially as Pauli algebra. Complex octonions have been used in a model of angular momentum.10
The squaring function  on the real number field forms the primordial composition algebra. When the field $K$ is taken to be real numbers R, then there are just six other real composition algebras.11 In two, four, and eight dimensions there are both a "split algebra" and a "division algebra": complex numbers and split-complex numbers, quaternions and split-quaternions, octonions and split-octonions.
