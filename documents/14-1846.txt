   Monod equation      Monod equation   The Monod equation is a mathematical model for the growth of microorganisms. It is named for Jacques Monod who proposed using an equation of this form to relate microbial growth rates in an aqueous environment to the concentration of a limiting nutrient. 1 2 3 The Monod equation has the same form as the Michaelis–Menten equation , but differs in that it is empirical while the latter is based on theoretical considerations.  The Monod equation is commonly used in environmental engineering . For example, it is used in the activated sludge model for sewage treatment .  Equation  The Monod equation is: 4      μ  =    μ  max    S    K  s   +  S         μ     subscript  μ      S     subscript  K  s   S       \mu=\mu_{\max}{S\over K_{s}+S}     (Figure)  The specific growth rate μ as a function of substrate concentration S.   where:   μ is the specific growth rate of the microorganisms  μ max is the maximum specific growth rate of the microorganisms  S is the concentration of the limiting  substrate for growth  K s is the "half-velocity constant"—the value of S when μ / μ max = 0.5   μ max and K s are empirical coefficients to the Monod equation. They will differ between species and based on the ambient environmental conditions.  Application notes  The rate of substrate utilization is related to the specific growth rate as follows: 5   r s u = − μX / Y    where:   X is the total biomass (since the specific growth rate, μ is normalized to the total biomass)  Y is the yield coefficient   r su is negative by convention.  In some applications, multiple terms of the form [S/(K s + S)] are multiplied together where more than one nutrient or growth factor has the potential to be limiting (e.g. organic matter and oxygen are both necessary to Heterotrophic bacteria).  Graphical determination of constants  As with the Michaelis–Menten equation graphical methods may be used to fit the coefficients of the Monod equation: 6   Eadie–Hofstee diagram  Lineweaver–Burk plot   See also   Activated sludge model (uses the Monod equation to model bacterial growth and substrate utilization)  Michaelis–Menten kinetics  Jacques Monod   References    "  Category:Environmental engineering  Category:Civil engineering  Category:Sewerage     Jacques Monod. 1949.
