Limonin-D-ring-lactonase




Limonin-D-ring-lactonase

In enzymology, a limonin-D-ring-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

limonoate D-ring-lactone + H2O 
 
 
 
  limonoate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are limonoate D-ring-lactone and H2O, whereas its product is limonoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is limonoate-D-ring-lactone lactonohydrolase. Other names in common use include limonin-D-ring-lactone hydrolase, and limonin lactone hydrolase.
