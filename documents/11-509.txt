   Limonin-D-ring-lactonase      Limonin-D-ring-lactonase   In enzymology , a limonin-D-ring-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   limonoate D-ring-lactone + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   limonoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are limonoate D-ring-lactone and H 2 O , whereas its product is limonoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is limonoate-D-ring-lactone lactonohydrolase . Other names in common use include limonin-D-ring-lactone hydrolase , and limonin lactone hydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
