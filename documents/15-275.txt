Smooth algebra

In algebra, a commutative k-algebra A is said to be 0-smooth if it satisfies the following lifting property: given a k-algebra C, an ideal N of C whose square is zero and a k-algebra map 
 
 
 
 , there exists a k-algebra map 
 
 
 
  such that u is v followed by the canonical map. If there exists at most one such lifting v, then A is said to be 0-unramified (or 0-neat). A is said to be 0-étale if it is 0-smooth and 0-unramified.
A finitely generated k-algebra A is 0-smooth over k if and only if Spec A is a smooth scheme over k.
A separable algebraic field extension L of k is 0-étale over k.1 The formal power series ring 
 
 
 
  is 0-smooth only when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (i.e., k has a finite p-basis.)2
I-smooth
Let B be an A-algebra and suppose B is given the I-adic topology, I an ideal of B. We say B is I-smooth over A if it satisfies the lifting property: given an A-algebra C, an ideal N of C whose square is zero and an A-algebra map 
 
 
 
  that is continuous when 
 
 
 
  is given the discrete topology, there exists an A-algebra map 
 
 
 
  such that u is v followed by the canonical map. As before, if there exists at most one such lift v, then B is said to be I-unramified over A (or I-neat). B is said to be I-étale if it is I-smooth and I-unramified. If I is the zero ideal and A is a field, these notions coincide with 0-smooth etc. as defined above.
A standard example is this: let A be a ring, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  Then B is I-smooth over A.
Let A be a noetherian local k-algebra with maximal ideal 
 
 
 
 . Then A is 
 
 
 
 -smooth over k if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a regular ring for any finite extension field 
 
 
 
  of k.3
