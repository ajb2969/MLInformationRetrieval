   Smooth algebra      Smooth algebra   In algebra , a commutative k -algebra A is said to be 0-smooth if it satisfies the following lifting property: given a k -algebra C , an ideal N of C whose square is zero and a k -algebra map    u  :   A  →   C  /  N       normal-:  u   normal-→  A    C  N      u:A\to C/N   , there exists a k -algebra map    v  :   A  →  C      normal-:  v   normal-→  A  C     v:A\to C   such that u is v followed by the canonical map. If there exists at most one such lifting v , then A is said to be 0-unramified (or 0-neat ). A is said to be 0-étale if it is 0-smooth and 0-unramified .  A finitely generated k -algebra A is 0-smooth over k if and only if Spec A is a smooth scheme over k .  A separable algebraic field extension L of k is 0-étale over k . 1 The formal power series ring    k   [   [   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   ]   ]       k   delimited-[]    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n       k[\![t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}]\!]   is 0-smooth only when     char  k   =  p  >  0         char  k   p       0     \operatorname{char}k=p>0   and     [  k  :   k  p   ]   <  ∞     fragments   fragments  normal-[  k  normal-:   superscript  k  p   normal-]       [k:k^{p}]<\infty   (i.e., k has a finite p -basis .) 2  I -smooth  Let B be an A -algebra and suppose B is given the I -adic topology, I an ideal of B . We say B is I -smooth over A if it satisfies the lifting property: given an A -algebra C , an ideal N of C whose square is zero and an A -algebra map    u  :   B  →   C  /  N       normal-:  u   normal-→  B    C  N      u:B\to C/N   that is continuous when    C  /  N      C  N    C/N   is given the discrete topology, there exists an A -algebra map    v  :   B  →  C      normal-:  v   normal-→  B  C     v:B\to C   such that u is v followed by the canonical map. As before, if there exists at most one such lift v , then B is said to be I -unramified over A (or I -neat ). B is said to be I -étale if it is I -smooth and I -unramified . If I is the zero ideal and A is a field, these notions coincide with 0-smooth etc. as defined above.  A standard example is this: let A be a ring,    B  =   A   [   [   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   ]   ]        B    A   delimited-[]    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n        B=A[\![t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}]\!]   and     I  =   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )    .      I    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      I=(t_{1},\ldots,t_{n}).   Then B is I -smooth over A .  Let A be a noetherian local k -algebra with maximal ideal   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   . Then A is   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   -smooth over k if and only if    A   ⊗  k    k  ′       subscript  tensor-product  k   A   superscript  k  normal-′     A\otimes_{k}k^{\prime}   is a regular ring for any finite extension field    k  ′     superscript  k  normal-′    k^{\prime}   of k . 3  See also   étale morphism  formally smooth morphism  Popescu’s theorem   References   H.
