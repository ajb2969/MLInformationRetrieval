   Monoclinic crystal system      Monoclinic crystal system   (Figure)  An example of the monoclinic crystals, orthoclase   In crystallography , the monoclinic  crystal system is one of the seven lattice point groups . A crystal system is described by three vectors . In the monoclinic system, the crystal is described by vectors of unequal lengths, as in the orthorhombic system. They form a rectangular prism with a parallelogram as its base. Hence two pairs of vectors are perpendicular (meet at right angles), while the third pair makes an angle other than 90°.  Bravais lattices and point/space groups  Two monoclinic Bravais lattices exist: the primitive monoclinic and the centered monoclinic lattices, with layers with a rectangular and rhombic lattice, respectively.

Sphenoidal is also monoclinic hemimorphic; Domatic is also monoclinic hemihedral; Prismatic is also monoclinic normal.  The three monoclinic hemimorphic space groups are as follows:   a prism with as cross-section wallpaper group p2  ditto with screw axes instead of axes  ditto with screw axes as well as axes, parallel, in between; in this case an additional translation vector is one half of a translation vector in the base plane plus one half of a perpendicular vector between the base planes.   The four monoclinic hemihedral space groups include   those with pure reflection at the base of the prism and halfway  those with glide planes instead of pure reflection planes; the glide is one half of a translation vector in the base plane  those with both in between each other; in this case an additional translation vector is this glide plus one half of a perpendicular vector between the base planes.   Specific chemical examples  An example of a monoclinic crystal is elemental sulfur (which can also occur in a rhombic form). 5  See also   Crystal structure   References   Hurlbut, Cornelius S.; Klein, Cornelis, 1985, Manual of Mineralogy , 20th ed., pp. 65 – 69, ISBN 0-471-80580-7   "  Category:Crystallography     ↩  ↩    C.Michael Hogan. 2011.
