Golden rhombus

 In geometry, a golden rhombus is a rhombus whose diagonals are in the ratio 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the golden ratio.
Golden rhombohedra
There are two distinct convex golden rhombohedra constructed from six golden rhombi as a trigonal trapezohedron. These are sometimes called acute or prolate and the obtuse or oblate golden rhombohedron.





 Acute form


 Obtuse form



The rhombic triacontahedron is constructed with 30 golden rhombic faces, alternating 3 and 5 around every vertex. The dihedral angle between adjacent rhombi of the rhombic triacontahedron is 144Â°, which can be constructed by placing the short sides of two golden triangles back-to-back. The rhombic icosahedron is also constructed with golden rhombi.




The nonconvex rhombic hexecontahedron can be constructed by 20 acute golden rhombohedra. It also represents a stellation of the rhombic triacontahedron.
