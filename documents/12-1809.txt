   Golden rhombus      Golden rhombus   In geometry , a golden rhombus is a rhombus whose diagonals are in the ratio     p  q   =   φ         p  q   φ    \frac{p}{q}=\varphi\!   , where    φ    φ   \varphi\!   is the golden ratio .  Golden rhombohedra  There are two distinct convex golden rhombohedra constructed from six golden rhombi as a trigonal trapezohedron . These are sometimes called acute or prolate and the obtuse or oblate golden rhombohedron.      Acute form   Obtuse form     The rhombic triacontahedron is constructed with 30 golden rhombic faces, alternating 3 and 5 around every vertex. The dihedral angle between adjacent rhombi of the rhombic triacontahedron is 144°, which can be constructed by placing the short sides of two golden triangles back-to-back. The rhombic icosahedron is also constructed with golden rhombi.      The nonconvex rhombic hexecontahedron can be constructed by 20 acute golden rhombohedra . It also represents a stellation of the rhombic triacontahedron .
