   Anticommutativity      Anticommutativity   In mathematics, anticommutativity is the property of an operation with two or more arguments wherein swapping the position of any two arguments negates the result. Anticommutative operations are widely used in algebra , geometry , mathematical analysis and, as a consequence, in physics : they are often called antisymmetric operations .  Definition  An   n   n   n   - ary operation is anticommutative if swapping the order of any two arguments negates the result. For example, a binary operation ∗ is anti-commutative if for all x and y ,    .    More formally, a map     *  :   A  n   →  𝔊     fragments   normal-:   superscript  A  n   normal-→  G    \scriptstyle*:A^{n}\to\mathfrak{G}   from the set of all n -tuples of elements in a set  A (where n is a general integer) to a group    𝔊   𝔊   \scriptstyle\mathfrak{G}   is anticommutative if and only if         x  1   *   x  2   *  …  *   x  n    =    sgn   (  σ  )     (    x   σ   (  1  )     *   x   σ   (  2  )     *  …  *   x   σ   (  n  )      )       ∀  𝒙   =   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   ∈   A  n       formulae-sequence       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n       sgn  σ      subscript  x    σ  1     subscript  x    σ  2    normal-…   subscript  x    σ  n            for-all  𝒙     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n          superscript  A  n       {x_{1}*x_{2}*\dots*x_{n}}=\operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)({x_{\sigma(1)}*x_{\sigma(%
 2)}*\dots*x_{\sigma(n)}})\qquad\forall\boldsymbol{x}=(x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})%
 \in A^{n}     where    σ  :    (  n  )   →   (  n  )       normal-:  σ   normal-→  n  n     \scriptstyle\sigma:(n)\to(n)   is an arbitrary permutation of the set ( n ) of the first n positive integers and    sgn   (  σ  )       sgn  σ    \mathrm{sgn}(\sigma)   is its sign . This equality expresses the following concept:   the value of the operation is unchanged, when applied to all ordered tuples constructed by even permutation of the elements of a fixed one.  the value of the operation is the inverse of its value on a fixed tuple , when applied to all ordered tuples constructed by odd permutation to the elements of the fixed one. The need for the existence of this inverse element is the main reason for requiring the codomain    𝔊   𝔊   \scriptstyle\mathfrak{G}   of the operation to be at least a group .   Note that this is an abuse of notation , since the codomain of the operation needs only to be a group : "−1" does not have a precise meaning since a multiplication is not necessarily defined on   𝔊   𝔊   \scriptstyle\mathfrak{G}   .  Particularly important is the case . A binary operation     *  :  A  ×  A  →  𝔊     fragments   normal-:  A   A  normal-→  G    \scriptstyle*:A\times A\to\mathfrak{G}   is anticommutative if and only if         x  1   *   x  2    =   -   (    x  2   *   x  1    )       ∀   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    ∈   A  ×  A       formulae-sequence       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2         subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1         for-all    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       A  A      x_{1}*x_{2}=-(x_{2}*x_{1})\qquad\forall(x_{1},x_{2})\in A\times A     This means that is the inverse of the element in   𝔊   𝔊   \scriptstyle\mathfrak{G}   .  Properties  If the group   𝔊   𝔊   \scriptstyle\mathfrak{G}   is such that        -  𝔞   =  𝔞   ⇔    𝔞  =  0     ∀  𝔞   ∈  𝔊       iff      𝔞   𝔞    formulae-sequence    𝔞  0      for-all  𝔞   𝔊      \mathfrak{-a}=\mathfrak{a}\iff\mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{0}\qquad\forall\mathfrak{%
