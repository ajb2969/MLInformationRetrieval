Christ–Kiselev maximal inequality

In mathematics, the Christ–Kiselev maximal inequality is a maximal inequality for filtrations, named for mathematicians Michael Christ and Alexander Kiselev.1
Continuous fibrations
A continuous fibration of 
 
 
 
  is a family of measurable sets 
 
 
 
  such that



 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  (stratific)


 
  (continuity)

For example, 
 
 
 
  with measure 
 
 
 
  that has no pure points and



is a continuous fibration.
Continuum version
Let 
 
 
 
  is a bounded linear operator for 

 
 finite

 
 . Define the Christ–Kiselev maximal function



where 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a bounded operator, and



Discrete version
Let 
 
 
 
  is a bounded linear operator for 

 
 finite

 
 . Define, for 
 
 
 
 ,



and 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a bounded operator.
Here, $A_\alpha=\begin{cases}[-\alpha,\alpha],&\alpha>0\\\emptyset,&\alpha\le0\end{cases}$.
The discrete version can be proved from the continuum version through constructing $T:L^p(\mathbb{R},dx)\to L^q(N,\nu)$.2
Applications
The Christ–Kiselev maximal inequality has applications to the Fourier transform and convergence of Fourier series, as well as to the study of Schrödinger operators.34
