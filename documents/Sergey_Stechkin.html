<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Sergey Stechkin was born on September 6, 1920 in <a class="uri" href="Moscow" title="wikilink">Moscow</a>. His father (<a href="Boris_Stechkin" title="wikilink">Boris Stechkin</a>) was a Soviet <a class="uri" href="turbojet" title="wikilink">turbojet</a> engine designer, academician. His great uncle, <a href="Nikolay_Yegorovich_Zhukovsky" title="wikilink">N.Ye. Zhukovsky</a>, was the founding father of modern <a href="Aerodynamics" title="wikilink">aero-</a> and <a class="uri" href="hydrodynamics" title="wikilink">hydrodynamics</a>. His maternal grandfather, <a href="Nikolay_Alexandrovich_Shilov" title="wikilink">N.A. Shilov</a>, was a notable chemist. His paternal grandfather was Sergey Solomin, a science fiction author.</p>

<p>Stechkin attended school 58 and then attempted to matriculate to <a href="Moscow_State_University" title="wikilink">Moscow State University</a>. He was turned down, likely due to the fact that the Soviet regime viewed his father as a political dissident at the time. He matriculated to Gorky State University instead. A year later, he was nevertheless able to transfer to the Mechanics and Mathematics department at Moscow State University, where he studied mathematics and was a student of <a href="Dmitrii_Evgenevich_Menshov" title="wikilink">D. E. Menshov</a>. Stechkin received his Ph.D. in 1948 with a dissertation titled “On the order of best approximations of continuous functions”.</p>

<p>Later he worked as a mathematician at the <a href="Steklov_Institute_of_Mathematics" title="wikilink">Steklov Institute of Mathematics</a> in Moscow. He was the founder and first director of the department of the Institute in <a class="uri" href="Yekaterinburg" title="wikilink">Yekaterinburg</a>. Later this department became the Institute of Mechanics and Mathematics at the Ural branch of the <a href="Russian_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Russian Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>

<p>Stechkin founded, and, for more than 20 years, served as editor-in-chief for the mathematical journal “<a href="Mathematical_Notes" title="wikilink">Mathematical Notes</a>” ().<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Stechkin served as professor of mathematics at <a href="Moscow_State_University" title="wikilink">Moscow State University</a> and his honors include the <a href="Chebyshev_Award" title="wikilink">Chebyshev Award</a> of the <a href="Russian_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Russian Academy of Sciences</a> in 1993. He died in 1995 in Moscow from age-related chronic illness.</p>

<p>His contribution to mathematics include the generalization of <a href="Jackson's_inequality" title="wikilink">Jackson's inequality</a> for all
