   Glucose-1-phosphate phosphodismutase      Glucose-1-phosphate phosphodismutase   In enzymology , a glucose-1-phosphate phosphodismutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 D-glucose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-glucose 1-phosphate , and two products , D-glucose and D-glucose 1,6-bisphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucose-1-phosphate:D-glucose-1-phosphate 6-phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in glycolysis / gluconeogenesis and starch and sucrose metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
