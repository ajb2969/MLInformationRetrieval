Basis pursuit

Basis pursuit is the mathematical optimization problem of the form:



where x is a N × 1 solution vector (signal), y is a M × 1 vector of observations (measurements), A is a M × N transform matrix (usually measurement matrix) and M 1 sense is desired.
When it is desirable to trade off exact congruence of Ax and y in exchange for a sparser x, basis pursuit denoising is preferred.
