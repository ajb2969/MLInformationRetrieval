Canonical cover

A canonical cover

 
  for F (a set of functional dependencies on a relation scheme) is a set of dependencies such that F logically implies all dependencies in 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  logically implies all dependencies in F.
The set 
 
 
 
  has two important properties:

No functional dependency in 
 
 
 
  contains an extraneous attribute.
Each left side of a functional dependency in 
 
 
 
  is unique. That is, there are no two dependencies 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .

Algorithm for computing a canonical cover 1




Repeat:
 
Use the union rule to replace any dependencies in 
 
 
 
  of the form 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  ..
Find a functional dependency in 
 
 
 
  with an extraneous attribute and delete it from 
 
 


... until 
 
 
 
  does not change
