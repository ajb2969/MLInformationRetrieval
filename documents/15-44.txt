   Canonical cover      Canonical cover   A canonical cover     F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   for F (a set of functional dependencies on a relation scheme ) is a set of dependencies such that F logically implies all dependencies in    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   , and    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   logically implies all dependencies in F.  The set    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   has two important properties:   No functional dependency in    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   contains an extraneous attribute.  Each left side of a functional dependency in    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   is unique. That is, there are no two dependencies    a  →  b     normal-→  a  b    a\to b   and    c  →  d     normal-→  c  d    c\to d   in    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   such that    a  =  c      a  c    a=c   .   Algorithm for computing a canonical cover 1        F  c   =  F       subscript  F  c   F    F_{c}=F     Repeat:  Use the union rule to replace any dependencies in    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   of the form    a  →  b     normal-→  a  b    a\to b   and    a  →  d     normal-→  a  d    a\to d   with    a  →   b  d      normal-→  a    b  d     a\to bd   ..  Find a functional dependency in    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   with an extraneous attribute and delete it from    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}      ... until    F  c     subscript  F  c    F_{c}   does not change   References  "  Category:Database theory  Category:Mathematical concepts  Category:Algorithms and data structures     Database system concepts by Abraham Silberschatz et al ↩
