   6G-fructosyltransferase      6G-fructosyltransferase   In enzymology , a 6G-fructosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   [1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]m + 1 alpha-D-glucopyranoside + [1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]n + 1 alpha-D-glucopyranoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]m alpha-D-glucopyranoside + [1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]n + 1 beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->6)-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (m > 0; n >   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   0)   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are [[[1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]m+1 alpha-D-glucopyranoside]] and [[[1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]n+1 alpha-D-glucopyranoside]], whereas its 4 products are [[[1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]m alpha-D-glucopyranoside]], [[[1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]n+1]], beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->6)-alpha-D-glucopyranoside (m > 0; n >= , and 0.  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1F-oligo[beta-D-fructofuranosyl-(2->1)-]sucrose 6G-beta-D-fructotransferase . Other names in common use include fructan:fructan 6G-fructosyltransferase , 1F(1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl)m , sucrose:1F(1-beta-D-fructofuranosyl)nsucrose , 6G-fructosyltransferase , 6G-FFT , 6G-FT , and 6G-fructotransferase .
