Log5

Log 5 is a formula invented by Bill James1 to estimate the probability that team A will win a game, based on the true winning percentage of Team A and Team B. It is equivalent to the Bradley-Terry-Luce model used for paired comparisons, the Elo rating system used in chess and the Rasch model used in the analysis of categorical data.2
Let 
 
 
 
  be the fraction of games won by team 
 
 
 
  and also let 
 
 
 
  be the fraction of games lost by team 
 
 
 
 . The Log5 estimate for the probability of A defeating B is 
 
 

A few notable properties

If 
 
 
 
 , Log5 will always give A a 100% chance of victory
If 
 
 
 
 , Log5 will always give A a 0% chance of victory
If 
 
 
 
 , Log5 will always return a 50% chance of victory for either side
If 
 
 
 
 , Log5 will give A a 
 
 
 
  probability of victory.

It may also be conveniently rewritten using the odds ratio3 as
