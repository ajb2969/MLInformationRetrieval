   Log5      Log5   Log 5 is a formula invented by Bill James 1 to estimate the probability that team A will win a game, based on the true winning percentage of Team A and Team B. It is equivalent to the Bradley-Terry-Luce model used for paired comparisons , the Elo rating system used in chess and the Rasch model used in the analysis of categorical data. 2  Let    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   be the fraction of games won by team   i   i   i   and also let     q  i   =   1  -   p  i         subscript  q  i     1   subscript  p  i      q_{i}=1-p_{i}   be the fraction of games lost by team   i   i   i   . The Log5 estimate for the probability of A defeating B is      p   A  ,  B    =     p  A   -    p  A   ×   p  B        p  A   +   p  B    -   2  ×   p  A   ×   p  B       .       subscript  p   A  B         subscript  p  A      subscript  p  A    subscript  p  B          subscript  p  A    subscript  p  B      2   subscript  p  A    subscript  p  B        p_{A,B}=\frac{p_{A}-p_{A}\times p_{B}}{p_{A}+p_{B}-2\times p_{A}\times p_{B}}.     A few notable properties   If     p  A   =  1       subscript  p  A   1    p_{A}=1   , Log5 will always give A a 100% chance of victory  If     p  A   =  0       subscript  p  A   0    p_{A}=0   , Log5 will always give A a 0% chance of victory  If     p  A   =   p  B        subscript  p  A    subscript  p  B     p_{A}=p_{B}   , Log5 will always return a 50% chance of victory for either side  If     p  A   =   1  /  2        subscript  p  A     1  2     p_{A}=1/2   , Log5 will give A a    1  -   p  B       1   subscript  p  B     1-p_{B}   probability of victory.   It may also be conveniently rewritten using the odds ratio 3 as       p   A  ,  B     q   A  ,  B     =     p  A    q  A    ×    q  B    p  B      .         subscript  p   A  B     subscript  q   A  B          subscript  p  A    subscript  q  A       subscript  q  B    subscript  p  B       \frac{p_{A,B}}{q_{A,B}}=\frac{p_{A}}{q_{A}}\times\frac{q_{B}}{p_{B}}.     Here as before     q   A  ,  B    =   1  -   p   A  ,  B          subscript  q   A  B      1   subscript  p   A  B       q_{A,B}=1-p_{A,B}   .
