   Chebyshev's theorem      Chebyshev's theorem   Chebyshev's theorem is a name given to several theorems proven by Russian  mathematician  Pafnuty Chebyshev   Bertrand's postulate  Chebyshev's inequality , on range of standard deviations around the mean, in statistics  Chebyshev's sum inequality  Chebyshev's equioscillation theorem  The statement that if the function    π   (  x  )    ln   x  /  x        π  x      x  x      \scriptstyle\pi(x)\ln x/x   has a limit at infinity, then the limit is 1 (where π is the prime-counting function). This result has been superseded by the prime number theorem .   "
