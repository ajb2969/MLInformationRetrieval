   Rank of an abelian group      Rank of an abelian group   In mathematics , the rank , Prüfer rank , or torsion-free rank of an abelian group  A is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset. 1 The rank of A determines the size of the largest free abelian group contained in A . If A is torsion-free then it embeds into a vector space over the rational numbers of dimension rank A . For finitely generated abelian groups , rank is a strong invariant and every such group is determined up to isomorphism by its rank and torsion subgroup . Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 have been completely classified. However, the theory of abelian groups of higher rank is more involved.  The term rank has a different meaning in the context of elementary abelian groups .  Definition  A subset { a α } of an abelian group is linearly independent (over Z ) if the only linear combination of these elements that is equal to zero is trivial: if          ∑  α     n  α    a  α     =  0   ,    n  α   ∈  ℤ    ,     formulae-sequence      subscript   α      subscript  n  α    subscript  a  α     0      subscript  n  α   ℤ     \sum_{\alpha}n_{\alpha}a_{\alpha}=0,\quad n_{\alpha}\in\mathbb{Z},     where all but finitely many coefficients n α are zero (so that the sum is, in effect, finite), then all coefficients are 0. Any two maximal linearly independent sets in A have the same cardinality , which is called the rank of A .  Rank of an abelian group is analogous to the dimension of a vector space . The main difference with the case of vector space is a presence of torsion . An element of an abelian group A is classified as torsion if its order is finite. The set of all torsion elements is a subgroup, called the torsion subgroup and denoted T ( A ). A group is called torsion-free if it has no non-trivial torsion elements. The factor-group A / T ( A ) is the unique maximal torsion-free quotient of A and its rank coincides with the rank of A .  The notion of rank with analogous properties can be defined for modules over any integral domain , the case of abelian groups corresponding to modules over Z .  Properties   The rank of an abelian group A coincides with the dimension of the Q -vector space A ⊗ Q . If A is torsion-free then the canonical map A → A ⊗ Q is injective and the rank of A is the minimum dimension of Q -vector space containing A as an abelian subgroup. In particular, any intermediate group Z n  n has rank n .    Abelian groups of rank 0 are exactly the periodic abelian groups .    The group Q of rational numbers has rank 1. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are realized as subgroups of Q and there is a satisfactory classification of them up to isomorphism. By contrast, there is no satisfactory classification of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 2. 2    Rank is additive over short exact sequences : if         0  →  A  →  B  →  C  →   0        normal-→  0  A    normal-→    B    normal-→    C    normal-→    0     0\to A\to B\to C\to 0\;         is a short exact sequence of abelian groups then rk B = rk A + rk C . This follows from the flatness of Q and the corresponding fact for vector spaces.    Rank is additive over arbitrary direct sums :           rank   (    ⊕   j  ∈  J     A  j    )    =    ∑   j  ∈  J     rank   (   A  j   )      ,       rank    subscript  direct-sum    j  J     subscript  A  j       subscript     j  J     rank   subscript  A  j       \operatorname{rank}\left(\bigoplus_{j\in J}A_{j}\right)=\sum_{j\in J}%
 \operatorname{rank}(A_{j}),         where the sum in the right hand side uses cardinal arithmetic .   Groups of higher rank  Abelian groups of rank greater than 1 are sources of interesting examples. For instance, for every cardinal d there exist torsion-free abelian groups of rank d that are indecomposable , i.e. cannot be expressed as a direct sum of a pair of their proper subgroups. These examples demonstrate that torsion-free abelian group of rank greater than 1 cannot be simply built by direct sums from torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1, whose theory is well-understood. Moreover, for every integer n ≥ 3, there is a torsion-free abelian group of rank 2 n − 2 that is simultaneously a sum of two indecomposable groups, and a sum of n indecomposable groups. Hence even the number of indecomposable summands of a group of an even rank greater or equal than 4 is not well-defined.  Another result about non-uniqueness of direct sum decompositions is due to A.L.S. Corner: given integers n ≥ k ≥ 1, there exists a torsion-free abelian group A of rank n such that for any partition n = r 1 + ... + r k into k natural summands, the group A is the direct sum of k indecomposable subgroups of ranks r 1 , r 2 , ..., r k . Thus the sequence of ranks of indecomposable summands in a certain direct sum decomposition of a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank is very far from being an invariant of A .  Other surprising examples include torsion-free rank 2 groups A n , m and B n , m such that A n is isomorphic to B n if and only if n is divisible by m .  For abelian groups of infinite rank, there is an example of a group K and a subgroup G such that   K is indecomposable;  K is generated by G and a single other element; and  Every nonzero direct summand of G is decomposable.   Generalization  The notion of rank can be generalized for any module M over an integral domain  R , as the dimension over R 0 , the quotient field , of the tensor product of the module with the field:         rank   (  M  )    =    dim   R  0     M   ⊗  R    R  0           rank  M     subscript  dimension   subscript  R  0      subscript  tensor-product  R   M   subscript  R  0       \text{rank}(M)=\dim_{R_{0}}M\otimes_{R}R_{0}        It makes sense, since R 0 is a field, and thus any module (or, to be more specific, vector space ) over it is free.  It is a generalization, since any abelian group is a module over the integers. It easily follows that the dimension of the product over Q is the cardinality of maximal linearly independent subset, since for any torsion element x and any rational q         x   ⊗  𝐙   q   =  0        subscript  tensor-product  𝐙   x  q   0    x\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}}q=0        See also   Rank of a group   References  "  Category:Abelian group theory     Page 46 of ↩  .
