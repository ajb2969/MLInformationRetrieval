   Modes of convergence (annotated index)      Modes of convergence (annotated index)   The purpose of this article is to serve as an annotated  index of various modes of convergence and their logical relationships. For an expository article, see Modes of convergence . Simple logical relationships between different modes of convergence are indicated (e.g., if one implies another), formulaically rather than in prose for quick reference, and indepth descriptions and discussions are reserved for their respective articles.   Guide to this index. To avoid excessive verbiage, note that each of the following types of objects is a special case of types preceding it: sets , topological spaces , uniform spaces , topological abelian groups (TAG), normed vector spaces , Euclidean spaces , and the real / complex numbers. Also note that any metric space is a uniform space. Finally, subheadings will always indicate special cases of their superheadings.  The following is a list of modes of convergence for:  A sequence of elements { a n } in a topological space ( Y )   Convergence , or "topological convergence" for emphasis (i.e. the existence of a limit).   ...in a uniform space ( U )   Cauchy-convergence   Implications:  -   Convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   Cauchy-convergence  -   Cauchy-convergence and convergence of a subsequence together   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   convergence.  - U is called "complete" if Cauchy-convergence (for nets)   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   convergence.  Note: A sequence exhibiting Cauchy-convergence is called a cauchy sequence to emphasize that it may not be convergent.  A series of elements Σ b k in a TAG ( G )   Convergence (of partial sum sequence)  Cauchy-convergence (of partial sum sequence)  Unconditional convergence   Implications:  -   Unconditional convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   convergence (by definition).  ...in a normed space ( N )   Absolute-convergence (convergence of    ∑   |   b  k   |          subscript  b  k      \sum|b_{k}|   )   Implications:  -   Absolute-convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   Cauchy-convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   absolute-convergence of some grouping 1 .  -   Therefore: N is Banach (complete) if absolute-convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   convergence.  -   Absolute-convergence and convergence together   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   unconditional convergence.  -   Unconditional convergence   ⇏   ⇏   \not\Rightarrow   absolute-convergence, even if N is Banach.  -   If N is a Euclidean space, then unconditional convergence   ≡     \equiv   absolute-convergence.  1 Note: "grouping" refers to a series obtained by grouping (but not reordering) terms of the original series. A grouping of a series thus corresponds to a subsequence of its partial sums.  A sequence of functions { f n } from a set ( S ) to a topological space ( Y )   Pointwise convergence   ...from a set ( S ) to a uniform space ( U )   Uniform convergence  Pointwise Cauchy-convergence  ''' Uniform Cauchy-convergence   Implications are cases of earlier ones, except:  -   Uniform convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   both pointwise convergence and uniform Cauchy-convergence.  -   Uniform Cauchy-convergence and pointwise convergence of a subsequence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   uniform convergence.  ...from a topological space ( X ) to a uniform space ( U )  For many "global" modes of convergence, there are corresponding notions of a ) "local" and b ) "compact" convergence, which are given by requiring convergence to occur a ) on some neighborhood of each point, or b ) on all compact subsets of X . Examples:   Local uniform convergence (i.e. uniform convergence on a neighborhood of each point)  Compact (uniform) convergence (i.e. uniform convergence on all compact subsets)  further instances of this pattern below.   Implications:  -   "Global" modes of convergence imply the corresponding "local" and "compact" modes of convergence. E.g.:  Uniform convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   both local uniform convergence and compact (uniform) convergence.  -   "Local" modes of convergence tend to imply "compact" modes of convergence. E.g.,  Local uniform convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   compact (uniform) convergence.  -   If   X   X   X   is locally compact, the converses to such tend to hold:  Local uniform convergence   ≡     \equiv   compact (uniform) convergence.  ...from a measure space (S,μ) to the complex numbers (C)   Almost everywhere convergence  Almost uniform convergence  L p convergence  Convergence in measure  Convergence in distribution   Implications:  -   Pointwise convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   almost everywhere convergence.  -   Uniform convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   almost uniform convergence.  -   Almost everywhere convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   convergence in measure. (In a finite measure space)  -   Almost uniform convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   convergence in measure.  -   L p convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   convergence in measure.  -   Convergence in measure   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   convergence in distribution if μ is a probability measure and the functions are integrable.

Pointwise absolute-convergence (pointwise convergence of    Σ   |   g  k   |       normal-Σ     subscript  g  k      \Sigma|g_{k}|   )  Uniform absolute-convergence (uniform convergence of    Σ   |   g  k   |       normal-Σ     subscript  g  k      \Sigma|g_{k}|   )  Normal convergence (convergence of the series of uniform norms     Σ    ||   g  k   ||   u       normal-Σ   subscript   norm   subscript  g  k    u     \Sigma||g_{k}||_{u}   )   Implications are cases of earlier ones, except:  -   Normal convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   uniform absolute-convergence  ...from a topological space ( X ) to a TAG ( G )   Local uniform convergence (of partial sum sequence)  Compact (uniform) convergence (of partial sum sequence)   Implications are all cases of earlier ones.  ...from a topological space ( X ) to a normed space ( N )   Local uniform absolute-convergence  Compact (uniform) absolute-convergence  Local normal convergence  ''' Compact normal convergence   Implications (mostly cases of earlier ones):  -   Uniform absolute-convergence   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   both local uniform absolute-convergence and compact (uniform) absolute-convergence.
