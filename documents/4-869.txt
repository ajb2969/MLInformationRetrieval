   Supercommutative algebra      Supercommutative algebra   In mathematics , a supercommutative algebra is a superalgebra (i.e. a Z 2 - graded algebra ) such that for any two homogeneous elements  x , y we have 1        y  x   =     (   -  1   )     |  x  |    |  y  |     x  y    .        y  x      superscript    1       x     y     x  y     yx=(-1)^{|x||y|}xy.\,     Equivalently, it is a superalgebra where the supercommutator       [  x  ,  y  ]   =    x  y   -     (   -  1   )     |  x  |    |  y  |     y   x          x  y       x  y      superscript    1       x     y     y  x      [x,y]=xy-(-1)^{|x||y|}yx\,     always vanishes. Algebraic structures which supercommute in the above sense are sometimes referred to as skew-commutative associative algebras to emphasize the anti-commutation, or, to emphasize the grading, graded-commutative or, if the supercommutativity is understood, simply commutative .  Any commutative algebra is a supercommutative algebra if given the trivial gradation (i.e. all elements are even). Grassmann algebras (also known as exterior algebras ) are the most common examples of nontrivial supercommutative algebras. The supercenter of any superalgebra is the set of elements that supercommute with all elements, and is a supercommutative algebra.  The even subalgebra of a supercommutative algebra is always a commutative algebra . That is, even elements always commute. Odd elements, on the other hand, always anticommute. That is,        x  y   +   y  x    =   0           x  y     y  x    0    xy+yx=0\,   for odd x and y . In particular, the square of any odd element x vanishes whenever 2 is invertible:       x  2   =   0.        superscript  x  2   0.    x^{2}=0.\,   Thus a commutative superalgebra (with 2 invertible and nonzero degree one component) always contains nilpotent elements.
