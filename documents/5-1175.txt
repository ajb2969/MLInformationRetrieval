In probability theory and statistics, the inverse gamma distribution is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions on the positive real line, which is the distribution of the reciprocal of a variable distributed according to the gamma distribution. Perhaps the chief use of the inverse gamma distribution is in Bayesian statistics, where the distribution arises as the marginal posterior distribution for the unknown variance of a normal distribution if an uninformative prior is used; and as an analytically tractable conjugate prior if an informative prior is required.
However, it is common among Bayesians to consider an alternative parametrization of the normal distribution in terms of the precision, defined as the reciprocal of the variance, which allows the gamma distribution to be used directly as a conjugate prior. Other Bayesians prefer to parametrize the inverse gamma distribution differently, as a scaled inverse chi-squared distribution.
Characterization
Probability density function
The inverse gamma distribution's probability density function is defined over the support





with shape parameter

 
  and scale parameter

 
 .1 Here 
 
 
 
  denotes the gamma function.
Unlike the Gamma distribution, which contains a somewhat similar exponential term, 
 
 
 
  is a scale parameter as the distribution function satisfies:



Cumulative distribution function
The cumulative distribution function is the regularized gamma function



where the numerator is the upper incomplete gamma function and the denominator is the gamma function. Many math packages allow you to compute Q, the regularized gamma function, directly.
Characteristic function


 
  in the expression of the characteristic function is the modified Bessel function of II kind.

Derivation from Gamma distribution
The pdf of the gamma distribution is



and define the transformation 
 
 
 
  then the resulting transformation is









= \frac{1}{\theta^k \Gamma(k)} \left(
\frac{1}{y}
\right)^{k-1} \exp
\left(
 \frac{-1}{\theta y}
\right)
\frac{1}{y^2} 






= \frac{1}{\theta^k \Gamma(k)} \left(
\frac{1}{y}
\right)^{k+1} \exp
\left(
 \frac{-1}{\theta y}
\right)







= \frac{1}{\theta^k \Gamma(k)} y^{-k-1} \exp
\left(
 \frac{-1}{\theta y}
\right).
