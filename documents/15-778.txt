   Pólya class      Pólya class   The Pólya class is a set of entire functions satisfying the requirement that if E(z) is in the class, then: 1 2   E(z) has no zero ( root ) in the upper half-plane .       |   E   (   x  +   i  y    )    |   ≥   |   E   (   x  -   i  y    )    |           E    x    i  y          E    x    i  y        |E(x+iy)|\geq|E(x-iy)|   for x and y real and y positive.      |   E   (   x  +   i  y    )    |        E    x    i  y       |E(x+iy)|   is a non-decreasing function of y for positive y .   Every entire function of Pólya class can be expressed as the limit of a series of polynomials having no zeros in the upper half-plane. 3  The product of two functions of Pólya class is also of Pólya class, so the class constitutes a monoid under the operation of multiplication of functions.  The Pólya class arises from investigations by Georg Pólya in 1913. 4 A de Branges space is defined on the basis of some "weight function" of Pólya class, but with the additional stipulation that the inequality be strict – that is,     |   E   (   x  +   i  y    )    |   >   |   E   (   x  -   i  y    )    |           E    x    i  y          E    x    i  y        |E(x+iy)|>|E(x-iy)|   for positive y .  The Pólya class is a subset of the Hermite–Biehler class , which does not include the third of the above three requirements. 5  A function with no roots in the upper half plane is of Pólya class if and only if two conditions are met: that the nonzero roots z n satisfy        ∑  n     1  -   Im   z  n       |   z  n   |   2     <  ∞        subscript   n       1   Im   subscript  z  n      superscript     subscript  z  n    2        \sum_{n}\frac{1-\operatorname{Im}z_{n}}{|z_{n}|^{2}}<\infty     (with roots counted according to their multiplicity ), and that the function can be expressed in the form of a Hadamard product       z  m    e   a  +   b  z   +   c   z  2        ∏  n     (   1  -   z  /   z  n     )    exp   (   z   Re   1   z  n      )           superscript  z  m    superscript  e    a    b  z     c   superscript  z  2        subscript  product  n       1    z   subscript  z  n         z   Re    1   subscript  z  n           z^{m}e^{a+bz+cz^{2}}\prod_{n}\left(1-z/z_{n}\right)\exp(z\operatorname{Re}%
 \frac{1}{z_{n}})     with c real and non-positive and Im b non-positive. (The non-negative integer m will be positive if E (0)=0. Even if the number of roots is infinite, the infinite product is well defined and converges. 6 )  Louis de Branges showed a connexion between functions of Pólya class and analytic functions whose imaginary part is non-negative in the upper half-plane (UHP), often called Nevanlinna functions . If a function E ( z ) is of Hermite-Biehler class and E (0) = 1, we can take the logarithm of E in such a way that it is analytic in the UHP and such that log( E (0)) = 0. Then E ( z ) is of Pólya class if and only if       Im    -   log   (   E   (  z  )    )     z    ≥  0        Im          E  z     z    0    \text{Im}\frac{-\log(E(z))}{z}\geq 0     (in the UHP). 7  Laguerre–Pólya class  A smaller class of entire functions is the Laguerre–Pólya class , which consists of those functions which are locally the limit of a series of polynomials whose roots are all real. Any function of Laguerre–Pólya class is also of Pólya class. Some examples are      sin   (  z  )    ,   cos   (  z  )    ,   exp   (  z  )    ,   and   exp   (   -   z  2    )      .       z     z     z     and       superscript  z  2        \sin(z),\cos(z),\exp(z),\text{ and }\exp(-z^{2}).     Examples  From the Hadamard form it is easy to create examples of functions of Pólya class. Some examples are:   A non-zero constant.     z   z   z     Polynomials having no roots in the upper half plane, such as    z  +  i      z  i    z+i         e  x  p   (   -   p  i  z    )       e  x  p      p  i  z      exp(-piz)   if and only if Re( p ) is non-negative      e  x  p   (   -   p   z  2     )       e  x  p      p   superscript  z  2       exp(-pz^{2})   if and only if p is a non-negative real number  any function of Laguerre-Pólya class      sin   (  z  )    ,   cos   (  z  )    ,   exp   (  z  )    ,   exp   (   -  z   )    ,   exp   (   -   z  2    )     .       z     z     z       z         superscript  z  2       \sin(z),\cos(z),\exp(z),\exp(-z),\exp(-z^{2}).
