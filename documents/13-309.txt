   Bloch-Siegert shift      Bloch-Siegert shift   (Figure)  The pot lid is rotating around an axis along the surface of the table that is quickly rotating. This results in a secondary rotation which is perpendicular to the table.  This is equivalent to the Bloch-Siegert shift and can be seen by watching the motion of the red dot.   The Bloch-Siegert shift is a phenomenon in quantum physics that becomes important for driven two-level systems when the driving gets strong (e.g. atoms driven by a strong laser drive or nuclear spins in NMR, driven by a strong oscillating magnetic field).  When the rotating wave approximation (RWA) is invoked, the resonance between the driving field and a pseudospin occurs when the field frequency   ω   ω   \omega   is identical to the spin's transition frequency    ω  0     subscript  ω  0    \omega_{0}   . The RWA is, however, an approximation. In 1940 Bloch and Siegert showed that the dropped parts oscillating rapidly can give rise to a shift in the true resonance frequency of the dipoles.  Rotating wave approximation  In RWA, when the perturbation to the two level system is     H   a  b    =     V   a  b    2    cos   (   ω  t   )          subscript  H    a  b         subscript  V    a  b    2       ω  t       H_{ab}=\frac{V_{ab}}{2}\cos{(\omega t)}   , a linearly polarized field is considered as a superposition of two circularly polarized fields of the same amplitude rotating in opposite directions with frequencies    ω  ,   -  ω      ω    ω     \omega,-\omega   . Then, in the rotating frame(   ω   ω   \omega   ), we can neglect the counter-rotating field and the Rabi frequency is       Ω  =    1  2       (   |    V   a  b    /  ℏ   |   )   2   +    (   ω  -   ω  0    )   2       .      normal-Ω      1  2        superscript       subscript  V    a  b    Planck-constant-over-2-pi    2    superscript    ω   subscript  ω  0    2        \Omega=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(|V_{ab}/\hbar|)^{2}+(\omega-\omega_{0})^{2}}.     Bloch-Siegert shift  Consider the effect due to the counter-rotating field. In the counter-rotating frame(    -  ω      ω    -\omega   ), the effective precession frequency is        Ω   e  f  f    =    1  2       (   |    V   a  b    /  ℏ   |   )   2   +    (   ω  +   ω  0    )   2       .       subscript  normal-Ω    e  f  f        1  2        superscript       subscript  V    a  b    Planck-constant-over-2-pi    2    superscript    ω   subscript  ω  0    2        \Omega_{eff}=\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{(|V_{ab}/\hbar|)^{2}+(\omega+\omega_{0})^{2}}.   Then the resonance frequency is given by       2  ω   =      (   |    V   a  b    /  ℏ   |   )   2   +    (   ω  +   ω  0    )   2           2  ω        superscript       subscript  V    a  b    Planck-constant-over-2-pi    2    superscript    ω   subscript  ω  0    2       2\omega=\sqrt{(|V_{ab}/\hbar|)^{2}+(\omega+\omega_{0})^{2}}   and there are two solutions      ω  =    ω  0    [   1  +    1  4     (    V   a  b     ℏ   ω  0     )   2     ]        ω     subscript  ω  0    delimited-[]    1      1  4    superscript     subscript  V    a  b      Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  ω  0     2         \omega=\omega_{0}\left[1+\frac{1}{4}\left(\frac{V_{ab}}{\hbar\omega_{0}}\right%
 )^{2}\right]   and       ω  =   -    1  3    ω  0    [   1  +    3  4     (    V   a  b     ℏ   ω  0     )   2     ]      .      ω        1  3    subscript  ω  0    delimited-[]    1      3  4    superscript     subscript  V    a  b      Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  ω  0     2          \omega=-\frac{1}{3}\omega_{0}\left[1+\frac{3}{4}\left(\frac{V_{ab}}{\hbar%
 \omega_{0}}\right)^{2}\right].   The shift from the RWA of the first solution is dominant, and the correction to    ω  0     subscript  ω  0    \omega_{0}   is known as the Bloch-Siegert shift:       δ   ω   B  -  S     =    1  4      (   V   a  b    )   2     ℏ  2    ω  0            δ   subscript  ω    B  S         1  4      superscript   subscript  V    a  b    2      superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2    subscript  ω  0        \delta\omega_{B-S}=\frac{1}{4}\frac{(V_{ab})^{2}}{\hbar^{2}\omega_{0}}     References   J.
