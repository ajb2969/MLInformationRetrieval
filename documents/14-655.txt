   Orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra      Orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra   In mathematics , an orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra is a pair    (  𝔤  ,  s  )     𝔤  s    (\mathfrak{g},s)   consisting of a real Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   and an automorphism    s   s   s   of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   of order   2   2   2   such that the eigenspace    𝔲   𝔲   \mathfrak{u}   of s corrsponding to 1 (i.e., the set   𝔲   𝔲   \mathfrak{u}   of fixed points ) is a compact subalgebra . If "compactness" is omitted, it is called a symmetric Lie algebra . An orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra is said to be effective if   𝔲   𝔲   \mathfrak{u}   intersects the center of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}    trivially . In practice, effectiveness is often assumed; we do this in this article as well.  The canonical example is the Lie algebra of a symmetric space ,   s   s   s   being the differential of a symmetry.  Every orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra decomposes into a direct sum of ideals "of compact type", "of noncompact type" and "of Euclidean type".  References   S.
