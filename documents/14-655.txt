Orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra

In mathematics, an orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra is a pair 
 
 
 
  consisting of a real Lie algebra

 
  and an automorphism

 
  of 
 
 
 
  of order 
 
 
 
  such that the eigenspace

 
  of s corrsponding to 1 (i.e., the set 
 
 
 
  of fixed points) is a compact subalgebra. If "compactness" is omitted, it is called a symmetric Lie algebra. An orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra is said to be effective if 
 
 
 
  intersects the center of 
 
 
trivially. In practice, effectiveness is often assumed; we do this in this article as well.
The canonical example is the Lie algebra of a symmetric space, 
 
 
 
  being the differential of a symmetry.
Every orthogonal symmetric Lie algebra decomposes into a direct sum of ideals "of compact type", "of noncompact type" and "of Euclidean type".
