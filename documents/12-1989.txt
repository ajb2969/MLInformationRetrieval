   Unisolvent functions      Unisolvent functions   In mathematics, a collection of n  functions  f 1 , f 2 , ..., f n is unisolvent on domain Ω if the vectors       [       f  1    (   x  1   )          f  1    (   x  2   )        ⋮        f  1    (   x  n   )       ]   ,   [       f  2    (   x  1   )          f  2    (   x  2   )        ⋮        f  2    (   x  n   )       ]   ,  …  ,   [       f  n    (   x  1   )          f  n    (   x  2   )        ⋮        f  n    (   x  n   )       ]           subscript  f  1    subscript  x  1         subscript  f  1    subscript  x  2      normal-⋮       subscript  f  1    subscript  x  n           subscript  f  2    subscript  x  1         subscript  f  2    subscript  x  2      normal-⋮       subscript  f  2    subscript  x  n      normal-…       subscript  f  n    subscript  x  1         subscript  f  n    subscript  x  2      normal-⋮       subscript  f  n    subscript  x  n        \begin{bmatrix}f_{1}(x_{1})\\
 f_{1}(x_{2})\\
 \vdots\\
 f_{1}(x_{n})\end{bmatrix},\begin{bmatrix}f_{2}(x_{1})\\
 f_{2}(x_{2})\\
 \vdots\\
 f_{2}(x_{n})\end{bmatrix},\dots,\begin{bmatrix}f_{n}(x_{1})\\
 f_{n}(x_{2})\\
 \vdots\\
 f_{n}(x_{n})\end{bmatrix}     are linearly independent for any choice of n distinct points x 1 , x 2 ... x n in Ω. Equivalently, the collection is unisolvent if the matrix  F with entries f i ( x j ) has nonzero determinant : det( F ) ≠ 0 for any choice of distinct x j 's in Ω.  Unisolvent systems of functions are widely used in interpolation since they guarantee a unique solution to the interpolation problem . Polynomials are unisolvent by the unisolvence theorem  Examples:   1, x , x 2 is unisolvent on any interval by the unisolvence theorem  1, x 2 is unisolvent on [0, 1], but not unisolvent on [−1, 1]  1, cos( x ), cos(2 x ), ..., cos( nx ), sin( x ), sin(2 x ), ..., sin( nx ) is unisolvent on [− π , π ]   Systems of unisolvent functions are much more common in 1 dimension than in higher dimensions. In dimension d = 2 and higher (Ω ⊂ R d ), the functions f 1 , f 2 , ..., f n cannot be unisolvent on Ω if there exists a single open set on which they are all continuous. To see this, consider moving points x 1 and x 2 along continuous paths in the open set until they have switched positions, such that x 1 and x 2 never intersect each other or any of the other x i . The determinant of the resulting system (with x 1 and x 2 swapped) is the negative of the determinant of the initial system. Since the functions f i are continuous, the intermediate value theorem implies that some intermediate configuration has determinant zero, hence the functions cannot be unisolvent.
