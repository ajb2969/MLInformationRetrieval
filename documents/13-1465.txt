   Searle's bar method      Searle's bar method   Searle's bar method is an experimental procedure to measure thermal conductivity of material. A bar of material is being heated by steam on one side and the other side cooled down by water while the length of the bar is thermally insulated . Then the heat Δ Q propagating through the bar in a time interval of Δ t is given by        (    Δ  Q    Δ  t    )   bar   =   -   k  A    Δ   T  bar    L          subscript      normal-Δ  Q     normal-Δ  t    bar       k  A      normal-Δ   subscript  T  bar    L       \left(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\right)_{\mathrm{bar}}=-kA\frac{\Delta T_{%
 \mathrm{bar}}}{L}   where   Δ Q is the heat supplied to the bar in time Δ t  k is the coefficient of thermal conductivity of the bar.  A is the cross-sectional area of the bar,  Δ T bar is the temperature difference of both ends of the bar  'L'' is the length of the bar   and the heat Δ Q absorbed by water in a time interval of Δ t is:        (    Δ  Q    Δ  t    )   water   =    C  w     Δ  m    Δ  t    Δ   T  water         subscript      normal-Δ  Q     normal-Δ  t    water      subscript  C  normal-w       normal-Δ  m     normal-Δ  t    normal-Δ   subscript  T  water      \left(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\right)_{\mathrm{water}}=C_{\mathrm{w}}\frac{%
 \Delta m}{\Delta t}\Delta T_{\mathrm{water}}     where   C w is the specific heat of water,  Δ m is the mass of water collected during time Δ t ,  Δ T water is difference in the temperature of water before and after it has gone through the bar.   Assuming perfect insulation and no energy loss, then        (    Δ  Q    Δ  t    )   bar   =    (    Δ  Q    Δ  t    )   water        subscript      normal-Δ  Q     normal-Δ  t    bar    subscript      normal-Δ  Q     normal-Δ  t    water     \left(\frac{\Delta Q}{\Delta t}\right)_{\mathrm{bar}}=\left(\frac{\Delta Q}{%
 \Delta t}\right)_{\mathrm{water}}     which leads to      k  =   -    C  w    L  A     Δ  m    Δ  t      Δ   T  water     Δ   T  bar           k       subscript  C  normal-w     L  A       normal-Δ  m     normal-Δ  t        normal-Δ   subscript  T  water      normal-Δ   subscript  T  bar         k=-C_{\mathrm{w}}\frac{L}{A}\frac{\Delta m}{\Delta t}\frac{\Delta T_{\mathrm{%
 water}}}{\Delta T_{\mathrm{bar}}}     References     "  Category:Heat conduction
