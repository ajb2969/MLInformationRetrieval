   Matrix geometric method      Matrix geometric method   In probability theory , the matrix geometric method is a method for the analysis of quasi-birth–death processes , continuous-time Markov chain whose transition rate matrices with a repetitive block structure. 1 The method was developed "largely by Marcel F. Neuts and his students starting around 1975." 2  Method description  The method requires a transition rate matrix with tridiagonal block structure as follows    Q=\begin{pmatrix}     B_{00} & B_{01} \\ B_{10} & A_1 & A_2 \\ & A_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\ && A_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\ &&& A_0 & A_1 & A_2 \\ &&&& \ddots & \ddots & \ddots \end{pmatrix}  where each of B 00 , B 01 , B 10 , A 0 , A 1 and A 2 are matrices. To compute the stationary distribution π writing π  Q = 0 the balance equations are considered for sub-vectors π i    \begin{align}     \pi_0 B_{00} + \pi_1 B_{10} &= 0\\ \pi_0 B_{01} + \pi_1 A_1 + \pi_2 A_0 &= 0\\ \pi_1 A_2 + \pi_2 A_1 + \pi_3 A_0 &= 0 \\ & \vdots \\ \pi_{i-1} A_2 + \pi_i A_1 + \pi_{i+1} A_0 &= 0\\ & \vdots \\ \end{align}  Observe that the relationship         π  i   =    π  1    R   i  -  1          subscript  π  i      subscript  π  1    superscript  R    i  1       \pi_{i}=\pi_{1}R^{i-1}        holds where R is the Neut's rate matrix, 3 which can be computed numerically. Using this we write    \begin{align}     \begin{pmatrix}\pi_0 & \pi_1 \end{pmatrix} \begin{pmatrix}B_{00} & B_{01} \\ B_{10} & A_1 + RA_0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \end{align}  which can be solve to find π 0 and π 1 and therefore iteratively all the π i .  Computation of R  The matrix R can be computed using cyclic reduction 4 or logarithmic reduction. 5 6  Matrix analytic method  The matrix analytic method is a more complicated version of the matrix geometric solution method used to analyse models with block M/G/1 matrices. 7 Such models are harder because no relationship like π i = π 1 R i – 1 used above holds. 8  External links   Performance Modelling and Markov Chains (part 2) by William J.
