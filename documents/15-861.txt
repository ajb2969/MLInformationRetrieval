Sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase




Sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase

Sulfoacetaldehyde dehydrogenase (, SafD) is an enzyme with system name 2-sulfoacetaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-sulfoacetaldehyde + H2O + NAD+

 
  sulfoacetate + NADH + 2 H+


This reaction is part of a bacterial pathway that can make use the amino group of taurine as a sole source of nitrogen for growth.
