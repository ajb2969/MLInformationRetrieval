   Kirillov character formula      Kirillov character formula   In mathematics , for a Lie group    G   G   G   , the Kirillov orbit method gives a heuristic method in representation theory . It connects the Fourier transforms of coadjoint orbits , which lie in the dual space of the Lie algebra of G , to the infinitesimal characters of the irreducible representations . The method got its name after the Russian mathematician Alexandre Kirillov .  At its simplest, it states that a character of a Lie group may be given by the Fourier transform of the Dirac delta function  supported on the coadjoint orbits, weighted by the square-root of the Jacobian of the exponential map , denoted by   j   j   j   . It does not apply to all Lie groups, but works for a number of classes of connected Lie groups, including nilpotent , some semisimple groups, and compact groups .  The Kirillov orbit method has led to a number of important developments in Lie theory, including the Duflo isomorphism and the wrapping map .  Character formula for compact Lie groups  Let   λ   λ   \lambda   be the highest weight of an irreducible representation in the dual of the Lie algebra of the maximal torus , denoted by    𝔱  *     superscript  𝔱     \mathfrak{t}^{*}   , and   ρ   ρ   \rho   half the sum of the positive roots .  We denote by      𝒪   λ  +  ρ      subscript  𝒪    λ  ρ     \mathcal{O}_{\lambda+\rho}     the coadjoint orbit through       λ  +  ρ   ∈   𝔱  *         λ  ρ    superscript  𝔱      \lambda+\rho\in\mathfrak{t}^{*}     and      μ   λ  +  ρ      subscript  μ    λ  ρ     \mu_{\lambda+\rho}     is the   G   G   G   -invariant measure on      𝒪   λ  +  ρ      subscript  𝒪    λ  ρ     \mathcal{O}_{\lambda+\rho}     with total mass       dim  π   =   d  λ        dimension  π    subscript  d  λ     \dim\pi=d_{\lambda}   ,  known as the Liouville measure . If     χ  π   =   χ  λ        subscript  χ  π    subscript  χ  λ     \chi_{\pi}=\chi_{\lambda}   is the character of a representation , then ' Kirillov's character formula ' for compact Lie groups is then given by        j   (  X  )    χ  λ    (   exp  X   )    =    ∫   𝒪   λ  +  ρ       e   i  β   (  X  )     d   μ   λ  +  ρ     (  β  )      ,    ∀  X   ∈  𝔤      formulae-sequence      j  X   subscript  χ  λ     X      subscript    subscript  𝒪    λ  ρ        superscript  e    i  β  X    d   subscript  μ    λ  ρ    β        for-all  X   𝔤     j(X)\chi_{\lambda}(\exp X)=\int_{\mathcal{O}_{\lambda+\rho}}e^{i\beta(X)}d\mu_%
 {\lambda+\rho}(\beta),\;\forall\;X\in\mathfrak{g}     Example: SU(2)  For the case of SU(2) , the highest weights are the positive half integers, and    ρ  =   1  /  2       ρ    1  2     \rho=1/2   . The coadjoint orbits are the two-dimensional spheres of radius    λ  +   1  /  2       λ    1  2     \lambda+1/2   , centered at the origin in 3-dimensional space.  By the theory of Bessel functions , it may be shown that          ∫   𝒪   λ  +   1  /  2        e   i  β   (  X  )     d   μ   λ  +   1  /  2      (  β  )     =    sin   (    (    2  λ   +  1   )   X   )     X  /  2     ,    ∀  X   ∈  𝔤    ,     formulae-sequence      subscript    subscript  𝒪    λ    1  2         superscript  e    i  β  X    d   subscript  μ    λ    1  2     β              2  λ   1   X      X  2        for-all  X   𝔤     \int_{\mathcal{O}_{\lambda+1/2}}e^{i\beta(X)}d\mu_{\lambda+1/2}(\beta)=\frac{%
 \sin((2\lambda+1)X)}{X/2},\;\forall\;X\in\mathfrak{g},     and       j   (  X  )    =    sin   X  /  2     X  /  2          j  X         X  2      X  2      j(X)=\frac{\sin X/2}{X/2}     thus yielding the characters of SU (2):        χ  λ    (   exp  X   )    =    sin   (    (    2  λ   +  1   )   X   )     sin   X  /  2            subscript  χ  λ     X              2  λ   1   X        X  2       \chi_{\lambda}(\exp X)=\frac{\sin((2\lambda+1)X)}{\sin X/2}     References   Kirillov, A.
