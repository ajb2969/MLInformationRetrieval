   Crossing sequence (Turing machines)      Crossing sequence (Turing machines)   In theoretical computer science , a crossing sequence at boundary i , denoted as     ùíû  i    (  x  )        subscript  ùíû  i   x    \mathcal{C}_{i}(x)   or sometimes    c  s   (  x  ,  i  )       c  s   x  i     cs(x,i)   , is the sequence of states      q   i  1    ,   q   i  2    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   q   i  k     ,      subscript  q   subscript  i  1     subscript  q   subscript  i  2    normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  q   subscript  i  k      q_{i_{1}},q_{i_{2}},...,q_{i_{k}},   of a Turing machine on input x, such that in this sequence of states, the head crosses between cell i and i + 1 (note that the first crossing is always a right crossing, and the next left, and so on...)  Sometimes, crossing sequence is considered as the sequence of configurations , which represent the three elements: the states, the contents of the tapes and the positions of the heads.  Study of crossing sequences is carried out, e.g., in computational complexity theory .  References  "  Category:Turing machine
