Pseudocircle

The pseudocircle is the finite topological space X consisting of four distinct points {a,b,c,d} with the following non-Hausdorff topology:


 
 . This topology corresponds to the partial order $a where open sets are downward closed sets. 
 ''X'' is highly [[pathological (mathematics)|pathological]] from the usual viewpoint of [[general topology]] as it fails to satisfy any [[separation axiom]] besides [[Kolmogorov space|T0]]. However, from the viewpoint of [[algebraic topology]] ''X'' has the remarkable property that it is indistinguishable from the [[circle]] ''S''1.
 
 More precisely the [[continuous map]] ''f'' from ''S''1 to ''X'' (where we think of ''S''1 as the [[unit circle]] in '''R'''2) given by
 : is a weak homotopy equivalence, that is f induces an isomorphism on all homotopy groups. It follows (proposition 4.21 in Hatcher) that f also induces an isomorphism on singular homology and cohomology and more generally an isomorphism on all ordinary or extraordinary homology and cohomology theories (e.g., K-theory).
This can be proved using the following observation. Like S1, X is the union of two contractible open sets {a,b,c} and {a,b,d} whose intersection {a,b} is also the union of two disjoint contractible open sets {a} and {b}. So like S1, the result follows from the groupoid Seifert-van Kampen Theorem, as in the book "Topology and Groupoids".
More generally McCord has shown that for any finite simplicial complex K, there is a finite topological space XK which has the same weak homotopy type as the geometric realization |K| of K. More precisely there is a functor, taking K to XK, from the category of finite simplicial complexes and simplicial maps and a natural weak homotopy equivalence from |K| to XK.
