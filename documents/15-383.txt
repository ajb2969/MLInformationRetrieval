   Alcuin's sequence      Alcuin's sequence   In mathematics , Alcuin's sequence , named after Alcuin of York , is the sequence of coefficients of the power-series expansion of: 1         x  3     (   1  -   x  2    )    (   1  -   x  3    )    (   1  -   x  4    )     =    x  3   +   x  5   +   x  6   +   2   x  7    +   x  8   +   3   x  9    +  ⋯    .         superscript  x  3       1   superscript  x  2      1   superscript  x  3      1   superscript  x  4         superscript  x  3    superscript  x  5    superscript  x  6     2   superscript  x  7     superscript  x  8     3   superscript  x  9    normal-⋯     \frac{x^{3}}{(1-x^{2})(1-x^{3})(1-x^{4})}=x^{3}+x^{5}+x^{6}+2x^{7}+x^{8}+3x^{9%
 }+\cdots.     The sequence begins with these integers: 2 3   0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 4, 7, 5, 8, 7, 10, 8, 12, 10, 14, 12, 16, 14, 19, 16, 21   The n th term is the number of triangles with integer sides and perimeter n . 4 It is also the number of triangles with distinct integer sides and perimeter n + 6, i.e. number of triples ( a , b , c ) such that 1 ≤ a      ↩   ↩
