   2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase      2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxopropyl-CoM + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-(S)-hydroxypropyl-CoM and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 2-oxopropyl-CoM , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-[2-(S)-hydroxypropylthio]ethanesulfonate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called 2-(2-(S)-hydroxypropylthio)ethanesulfonate dehydrogenase .
