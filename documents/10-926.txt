   Divinyl chlorophyllide a 8-vinyl-reductase      Divinyl chlorophyllide a 8-vinyl-reductase   In enzymology , a divinyl chlorophyllide a 8-vinyl-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   chlorophyllide a + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   divinyl chlorophyllide a + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chlorophyllide a and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are divinyl chlorophyllide a , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chlorophyllide-a:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include [4-vinyl]chlorophyllide a reductase , and 4VCR . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism .  References        "  Category:EC 1.3.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
