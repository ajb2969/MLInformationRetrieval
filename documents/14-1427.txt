   Faber polynomials      Faber polynomials   In mathematics, the Faber polynomials  P m of a Laurent series       f   (  z  )    =    z   -  1    +   a  0   +    a  1   z   +  ⋯         f  z      superscript  z    1     subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   z   normal-⋯     \displaystyle f(z)=z^{-1}+a_{0}+a_{1}z+\cdots   are the polynomials such that        P  m    (  f  )    -   z   -  m           subscript  P  m   f    superscript  z    m      \displaystyle P_{m}(f)-z^{-m}   vanishes at z =0.
