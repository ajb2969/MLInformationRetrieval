   Hodge bundle      Hodge bundle   In mathematics , the Hodge bundle , named after W. V. D. Hodge , appears in the study of families of curves , where it provides an invariant in the moduli theory of algebraic curves . Furthermore, it has applications to the theory of modular forms on reductive  algebraic groups 1 and string theory . 2  Definitions  Let    ℳ  g     subscript  ℳ  g    \mathcal{M}_{g}   be the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus  g curves over some scheme . The Hodge bundle Λ g is a vector bundle on    ℳ  g     subscript  ℳ  g    \mathcal{M}_{g}   whose fiber at a point C in    ℳ  g     subscript  ℳ  g    \mathcal{M}_{g}   is the space of holomorphic differentials on the curve C . To define the Hodge bundle, let    π  :    𝒞  g   →   ℳ  g       normal-:  π   normal-→   subscript  𝒞  g    subscript  ℳ  g      \pi:\mathcal{C}_{g}\rightarrow\mathcal{M}_{g}   be the universal algebraic curve of genus g and let ω g be its relative dualizing sheaf . The Hodge bundle is the pushforward of this sheaf, i.e. 3        Λ  g   =    π  *    ω  g     .       subscript  normal-Λ  g      subscript  π     subscript  ω  g      \Lambda_{g}=\pi_{*}\omega_{g}.\,     See also   ELSV formula   Notes  References       "  Category:Moduli theory  Category:Invariant theory  Category:Algebraic curves     ↩  ↩  ↩
