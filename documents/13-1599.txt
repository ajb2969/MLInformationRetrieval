Hodge bundle

In mathematics, the Hodge bundle, named after W. V. D. Hodge, appears in the study of families of curves, where it provides an invariant in the moduli theory of algebraic curves. Furthermore, it has applications to the theory of modular forms on reductive algebraic groups1 and string theory.2
Definitions
Let 
 
 
 
  be the moduli space of algebraic curves of genus g curves over some scheme. The Hodge bundle Λg is a vector bundle on 
 
 
 
  whose fiber at a point C in 
 
 
 
  is the space of holomorphic differentials on the curve C. To define the Hodge bundle, let 
 
 
 
  be the universal algebraic curve of genus g and let ωg be its relative dualizing sheaf. The Hodge bundle is the pushforward of this sheaf, i.e.3
