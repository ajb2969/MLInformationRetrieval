History
J4 is one of the 26 Sporadic groups. Zvonimir Janko found J4 in 1975 by studying groups with an involution centralizer of the form 21 + 12.3.(M22:2). Its existence and uniqueness was shown using computer calculations by Simon P. Norton and others in 1980. It has a modular representation of dimension 112 over the finite field with 2 elements and is the stabilizer of a certain 4995 dimensional subspace of the exterior square, a fact which Norton used to construct it, and which is the easiest way to deal with it computationally.  and  gave computer-free proofs of uniqueness.  and  gave a computer-free proof of existence by constructing it as an amalgams of groups 210:SL5(2) and (210:24:A8):2 over a group 210:24:A8.
The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial.
Since 37 and 43 are not supersingular primes, J4 cannot be a subquotient of the monster group. Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the pariahs.
Representations
The smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 1333; there are two complex conjugate representations of this dimension. The smallest faithful representation over any field is a 112 dimensional representation over the field of 2 elements.
The smallest permutation representation is on 173067389 points, with point stabilizer of the form 211M24. These points can be identified with certain "special vectors" in the 112 dimensional representation.
Presentation
It has a presentation in terms of three generators a, b, and c as



Maximal subgroups
found the 13 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of J4 as follows:

211:M24 - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups; also containing 211:(M22:2), centralizer of involution of class 2B
21+12.3.(M22:2) - centralizer of involution of class 2A - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups
210:PSL(5,2)
23+12.(S5 × PSL(3,2)) - containing Sylow 2-subgroups
U3(11):2
M22:2
111+2:(5 × GL(2,3)) - normalizer of Sylow 11-subgroup
PSL(2,32):5
PGL(2,23)
U3(3) - containing Sylow 3-subgroups
29:28 Frobenius group
43:14 Frobenius group
37:12 Frobenius group

A Sylow 3-subgroup is a Heisenberg group: order 27, non-abelian, all non-trivial elements of order 3.
