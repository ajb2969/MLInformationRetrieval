   Janko group J4      Janko group J4     In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Janko group  J 4 is a sporadic simple group of order   2 21 {{·}}3 3 {{·}}5{{·}}7{{·}}11 3 {{·}}23{{·}}29{{·}}31{{·}}37{{·}}43  = 86775571046077562880  ≈ 9     ×    10  1   9       absent     superscript  10  1   9     \times 10^{1}9   .   History  J 4 is one of the 26 Sporadic groups . Zvonimir Janko found J 4 in 1975 by studying groups with an involution centralizer of the form 2 1 + 12 .3.(M 22 :2). Its existence and uniqueness was shown using computer calculations by Simon P. Norton and others in 1980. It has a modular representation of dimension 112 over the finite field with 2 elements and is the stabilizer of a certain 4995 dimensional subspace of the exterior square, a fact which Norton used to construct it, and which is the easiest way to deal with it computationally.  and  gave computer-free proofs of uniqueness.  and  gave a computer-free proof of existence by constructing it as an amalgams of groups 2 10 :SL 5 (2) and (2 10 :2 4 :A 8 ):2 over a group 2 10 :2 4 :A 8 .  The Schur multiplier and the outer automorphism group are both trivial .  Since 37 and 43 are not supersingular primes, J 4 cannot be a subquotient of the monster group . Thus it is one of the 6 sporadic groups called the pariahs .  Representations  The smallest faithful complex representation has dimension 1333; there are two complex conjugate representations of this dimension. The smallest faithful representation over any field is a 112 dimensional representation over the field of 2 elements.  The smallest permutation representation is on 173067389 points, with point stabilizer of the form 2 11 M 24 . These points can be identified with certain "special vectors" in the 112 dimensional representation.  Presentation  It has a presentation in terms of three generators a, b, and c as      a  2     superscript  a  2    \displaystyle a^{2}     Maximal subgroups  found the 13 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of J 4 as follows:   2 11 :M 24 - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups; also containing 2 11 :(M 22 :2), centralizer of involution of class 2B  2 1+12 .3.(M 22 :2) - centralizer of involution of class 2A - containing Sylow 2-subgroups and Sylow 3-subgroups  2 10 :PSL(5,2)  2 3+12 .(S 5 × PSL(3,2)) - containing Sylow 2-subgroups  U 3 (11):2  M 22 :2  11 1+2 :(5 × GL(2,3)) - normalizer of Sylow 11-subgroup  PSL(2,32):5  PGL(2,23)  U 3 (3) - containing Sylow 3-subgroups  29:28 Frobenius group  43:14 Frobenius group  37:12 Frobenius group   A Sylow 3-subgroup is a Heisenberg group : order 27, non-abelian, all non-trivial elements of order 3.
