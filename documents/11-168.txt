5-dehydro-4-deoxyglucarate dehydratase

In enzymology, a 5-dehydro-4-deoxyglucarate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate 
 
 
 
  2,5-dioxopentanoate + H2O + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate, but three products: 2,5-dioxopentanoate, H2O, and CO2.
Enzyme class
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate hydro-lyase (decarboxylating 2,5-dioxopentanoate-forming). Other names in common use include 5-keto-4-deoxy-glucarate dehydratase, 5-keto-4-deoxy-glucarate dehydratase, deoxyketoglucarate dehydratase, D-4-deoxy-5-ketoglucarate hydro-lyase, and 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate hydro-lyase (decarboxylating). This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
