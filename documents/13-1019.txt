   Bray–Curtis dissimilarity      Bray–Curtis dissimilarity   In ecology and biology , the Bray–Curtis dissimilarity , named after J. Roger Bray and John T. Curtis, 1 is a statistic used to quantify the compositional dissimilarity between two different sites, based on counts at each site. As defined by Bray and Curtis, the index of dissimilarity is:       B   C   i  j     =   1  -    2   C   i  j       S  i   +   S  j            B   subscript  C    i  j       1      2   subscript  C    i  j        subscript  S  i    subscript  S  j        BC_{ij}=1-\frac{2C_{ij}}{S_{i}+S_{j}}     Where    C   i  j      subscript  C    i  j     C_{ij}   is the sum of the lesser values for only those species in common between both sites.    S  i     subscript  S  i    S_{i}   and    S  j     subscript  S  j    S_{j}   are the total number of specimens counted at both sites. The index reduces to 2C/2 = C where abundances at each site are expressed as a percentage. Further treatment can be found in Legendre & Legendre 2  The Bray–Curtis dissimilarity is directly related to the Sørensen similarity index     Q   S   i  j        Q   subscript  S    i  j      QS_{ij}   between the same sites:         B  C   ¯    i  j    =   1  -   Q   S   i  j           subscript   normal-¯    B  C      i  j      1    Q   subscript  S    i  j        \overline{BC}_{ij}=1-QS_{ij}   .  The Bray–Curtis dissimilarity is bound between 0 and 1, where 0 means the two sites have the same composition (that is they share all the species), and 1 means the two sites do not share any species. At sites with where BC is intermediate (e.g. BC = 0.5) this index differs from other commonly used indices. 3  The Bray–Curtis dissimilarity is often erroneously called a distance. It is not a distance since it does not satisfy triangle inequality , and should always be called a dissimilarity to avoid confusion. A software implementation for large samples is provided as part of the mothur software package. 4  References  5. Czekanowski J (1909) Zur Differentialdiagnose der Neandertalgruppe.
