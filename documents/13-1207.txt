   Fréchet mean      Fréchet mean   In mathematics and statistics , the Fréchet mean is a generalization of centroids to metric spaces , giving a single representative point or central tendency for a cluster of points. It is named after Maurice Fréchet . Karcher means are a closely related construction named after Hermann Karcher. 1 On the real numbers, the arithmetic mean , median , geometric mean , and harmonic mean can all be interpreted as Fréchet means for different distance functions.  Definition  The Fréchet mean (), is the point, x , that minimizes the Fréchet function, in cases where such a unique minimizer exists. The value at a point p , of the Fréchet function associated to a random point X on a complete metric space ( M , d ) is the expected squared distance from p to X . In particular, the Fréchet mean of a set of discrete random points x i is the minimizer m of the weighted sum of squared distances from an arbitrary point to each point of positive probability (weight), assuming this minimizer is unique. In symbols:      m  =      arg   min    p  ∈  M      ∑   i  =  1   N     w  i    d  2    (  p  ,   x  i   )          m    subscript    arg  min     p  M      superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  w  i    superscript  d  2    p   subscript  x  i         m=\mathop{\mathrm{arg\ min}}_{p\in M}\sum_{i=1}^{N}w_{i}d^{2}(p,x_{i})   .  A Karcher mean is a local minimum of the same function. 2  Examples of Fréchet Means  Arithmetic mean and median  For real numbers, the arithmetic mean is a Fréchet mean, using the usual Euclidean distance as the distance function. The median is also a Fréchet mean, using the square root of the distance. 3  Geometric mean  On the positive real numbers, the (hyperbolic) distance function     d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   |    log   (  x  )    -   log   (  y  )     |         d   x  y          x     y       d(x,y)=|\log(x)-\log(y)|   can be defined. The geometric mean is the corresponding Fréchet mean. Indeed    f  :   x  ↦   e  x       normal-:  f   maps-to  x   superscript  e  x      f:x\mapsto e^{x}   is then an isometry from the euclidean space to this "hyperbolic" space and must respect the Fréchet mean: the Fréchet mean of the    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is the image by   f   f   f   of the Fréchet mean (in the Euclidean sense) of the     f   -  1     (   x  i   )        superscript  f    1     subscript  x  i     f^{-1}(x_{i})   , i.e. it must be:       f   (    1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n     f   -  1     (   x  i   )      )    =   exp   (    1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    log   x  i      )    =     x  1   ⋯   x  n    n           f      1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      superscript  f    1     subscript  x  i             1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  x  i               n      subscript  x  1   normal-⋯   subscript  x  n        f\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}f^{-1}(x_{i})\right)=\exp\left(\frac{1}{n}\sum%
 _{i=1}^{n}\log x_{i}\right)=\sqrt[n]{x_{1}\cdots x_{n}}   .  Harmonic mean  On the positive real numbers , the metric (distance function)      d  H    (  x  ,  y  )    =   |    1  x   -   1  y    |          subscript  d  H    x  y          1  x     1  y       d_{H}(x,y)=\left|\frac{1}{x}-\frac{1}{y}\right|   can be defined. The harmonic mean is the corresponding Fréchet mean.  Power means  Given a non-zero real number   m   m   m   , the power mean can be obtained as a Fréchet mean by introducing the metric        d  m    (  x  ,  y  )    =   |    x  m   -   y  m    |          subscript  d  m    x  y         superscript  x  m    superscript  y  m       d_{m}(x,y)=|x^{m}-y^{m}|   .  f-mean  Given an invertible function   f   f   f   , the f-mean can be defined as the Fréchet mean obtained by using the metric      d  f    (  x  ,  y  )    =   |    f   (  x  )    -   f   (  y  )     |          subscript  d  f    x  y          f  x     f  y       d_{f}(x,y)=|f(x)-f(y)|   . This is sometimes called the Generalised f-mean or Quasi-arithmetic mean .  Weighted means  The general definition of the Fréchet mean that includes the possibility of weighting observations can be used to derive weighted versions for all of the above types of means.
