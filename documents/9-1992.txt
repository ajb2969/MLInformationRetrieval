Neutral vector

In statistics, and specifically in the study of the Dirichlet distribution, a neutral vector of random variables is one that exhibits a particular type of statistical independence amongst its elements.1 In particular, when elements of the random vector must add up to certain sum, then an element in the vector is neutral with respect to the others if the distribution of the vector created by expressing the remaining elements as proportions of their total is independent of the element that was omitted.
Definition
A single element 
 
 
 
  of a random vector 
 
 
 
  is neutral if the relative proportions of all the other elements are independent of 
 
 
 
 . The concept was originally developed for the study of turtle scutes.
Formally, consider the vector of random variables


 
  where


 
 . The values 
 
 
 
  are interpreted as lengths whose sum is unity. In a variety of contexts, it is often desirable to eliminate a proportion, say 
 
 
 
 , and consider the distribution of the remaining intervals within the remaining length. The first element of 
 
 
 
 , viz 
 
 
 
  is defined as neutral if 
 
 
 
  is statistically independent of the vector



Variable 
 
 
 
  is neutral if 
 
 
 
  is independent of the remaining interval: that is, 
 
 
 
  being independent of



Thus 
 
 
 
 , viewed as the first element of 
 
 
 
 , is neutral.
In general, variable 
 
 
 
  is neutral if 
 
 
 
  is independent of



A vector for which each element is neutral is completely neutral.
If 
 
 
 
  is drawn from a Dirichlet distribution, then 
 
 
 
  is completely neutral. In 1980, James and Mosimann2 showed that the Dirichlet distribution is characterised by neutrality.
