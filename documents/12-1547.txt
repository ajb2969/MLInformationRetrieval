   Quartic reciprocity      Quartic reciprocity   Quartic or biquadratic reciprocity is a collection of theorems in elementary and algebraic  number theory that state conditions under which the congruence  x 4 ≡ p (mod q ) is solvable; the word "reciprocity" comes from the form of some of these theorems, in that they relate the solvability of the congruence x 4 ≡ p (mod q ) to that of x 4 ≡ q (mod p ).  History  Euler made the first conjectures about biquadratic reciprocity. 1  Gauss published two monographs on biquadratic reciprocity. In the first one (1828) he proved Euler's conjecture about the biquadratic character of 2. In the second one (1832) he stated the biquadratic reciprocity law for the Gaussian integers and proved the supplementary formulas. He said 2 that a third monograph would be forthcoming with the proof of the general theorem, but it never appeared. Jacobi presented proofs in his Königsberg lectures of 1836–37. 3 The first published proofs were by Eisenstein. 4 5 6 7  Since then a number of other proofs of the classical (Gaussian) version have been found, 8 as well as alternate statements. Lemmermeyer states that there has been an explosion of interest in the rational reciprocity laws since the 1970s. 9  Integers  A quartic or biquadratic residue (mod p ) is any number congruent to the fourth power of an integer (mod p ). If x 4 ≡ a (mod p ) does not have an integer solution, a is a quartic or biquadratic nonresidue (mod p ). 10  As is often the case in number theory, it is easiest to work modulo prime numbers, so in this section all moduli p , q , etc., are assumed to positive, odd primes. 11  Gauss  The first thing to notice when working within the ring Z of integers is that if the prime number q is ≡ 3 (mod 4) then every quadratic residue (mod q ) is also a biquadratic residue (mod q ). The first supplement of quadratic reciprocity states that −1 is a quadratic nonresidue (mod q ), so that for any integer x , one of x and − x is a quadratic residue and the other one is a nonresidue. Thus, if r ≡ a 2 (mod q ) is a quadratic residue, then if a ≡ b 2 is a residue, r ≡ a 2 ≡ b 4 (mod q ) is a biquadratic residue, and if a is a nonresidue, − a is a residue, − a ≡ b 2 , and again, r ≡ (− a ) 2 ≡ b 4 (mod q ) is a biquadratic residue. 12  Therefore, the only interesting case is when the modulus p ≡ 1 (mod 4).  Gauss proved 13 that if p ≡ 1 (mod 4) then the nonzero residue classes (mod p ) can be divided into four sets, each containing ( p −1)/4 numbers. Let e be a quadratic nonresidue. The first set is the quartic residues; the second one is e times the numbers in the first set, the third is e 2 times the numbers in the first set, and the fourth one is e 3 times the numbers in the first set. Another way to describe this division is to let g be a primitive root (mod p ); then the first set is all the numbers whose indices with respect to this root are ≡ 0 (mod 4), the second set is all those whose indices are ≡ 1 (mod 4), etc. 14 In the vocabulary of group theory , the first set is a subgroup of index 4 (of the multiplicative group Z /p Z × ), and the other three are its cosets.  The first set is the biquadratic residues, the third set is the quadratic residues that are not quartic residues, and the second and fourth sets are the quadratic nonresidues. Gauss proved that −1 is a biquadratic residue if p ≡ 1 (mod 8) and a quadratic, but not biquadratic, residue, when p ≡ 5 (mod 8). 15  2 is a quadratic residue mod p if and only if p ≡ ±1 (mod 8). Since p is also ≡ 1 (mod 4), this means p ≡ 1 (mod 8). Every such prime is the sum of a square and twice a square. 16  Gauss proved 17  '''Let q = a 2 + 2 b 2 ≡ 1 (mod 8) be a prime number. Then : 2 is a biquadratic residue (mod q ) if and only if a ≡ ±1 (mod 8), and'''   2 is a quadratic, but not a biquadratic, residue (mod q ) if and only if a ≡ ±3 (mod 8).    Every prime p ≡ 1 (mod 4) is the sum of two squares. 18 If p = a 2 + b 2 where a is odd and b is even, Gauss proved 19 that  2 belongs to the first (respectively second, third, or fourth) class defined above if and only if b ≡ 0 (resp. 2, 4, or 6) (mod 8). The first case of this is one of Euler's conjectures:   2 is a biquadratic residue of a prime p ≡ 1 (mod 4) if and only if p = a 2 + 64 b 2 .    Dirichlet  For an odd prime number p and a quadratic residue a (mod p ), Euler's criterion states that      a    p  -  1   2    ≡   1     (   mod  p   )     ,       superscript  a      p  1   2     annotated  1   pmod  p      a^{\frac{p-1}{2}}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p),   so if p ≡ 1 (mod 4),      a    p  -  1   4    ≡    ±  1      (   mod  p   )     .       superscript  a      p  1   4     annotated   plus-or-minus  1    pmod  p      a^{\frac{p-1}{4}}\equiv\pm 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     Define the rational quartic residue symbol for prime p ≡ 1 (mod 4) and quadratic residue a (mod p ) as       (   a  p   )   4   =   ±  1   ≡    a    p  -  1   4       (   mod  p   )     .         subscript    a  p   4    plus-or-minus  1         annotated   superscript  a      p  1   4     pmod  p       \Bigg(\frac{a}{p}\Bigg)_{4}=\pm 1\equiv a^{\frac{p-1}{4}}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod%
 }}p).   It is easy to prove that a is a biquadratic residue (mod p ) if and only if      (   a  p   )   4   =  1.       subscript    a  p   4   1.    \Bigg(\frac{a}{p}\Bigg)_{4}=1.     Dirichlet 20 simplified Gauss's proof of the biquadratic character of 2 (his proof only requires quadratic reciprocity for the integers) and put the result in the following form:  Let p = a 2 + b 2 ≡ 1 (mod 4) be prime, and let i ≡ b / a (mod p ). Then         (   2  p   )   4   ≡    i    a  b   2       (   mod  p   )     .       subscript    2  p   4    annotated   superscript  i      a  b   2     pmod  p      \Bigg(\frac{2}{p}\Bigg)_{4}\equiv i^{\frac{ab}{2}}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).   (Note that i 2 ≡ −1 (mod p ).)  In fact, 21 let p = a 2 + b 2 = c 2 + 2 d 2 = e 2 − 2 f 2 ≡ 1 (mod 8) be prime, and assume a is odd. Then         (   2  p   )   4   =    (   -  1   )    b  4    =   (   2  c   )   =    (   -  1   )    n  +   d  2     =   (    -  2   e   )    ,         subscript    2  p   4    superscript    1     b  4           2  c         superscript    1     n    d  2              2   e      \Bigg(\frac{2}{p}\Bigg)_{4}=\left(-1\right)^{\frac{b}{4}}=\Bigg(\frac{2}{c}%
 \Bigg)=\left(-1\right)^{n+\frac{d}{2}}=\Bigg(\frac{-2}{e}\Bigg),   where    (   x  q   )      x  q    (\tfrac{x}{q})   is the ordinary Legendre symbol .  Going beyond the character of 2, let the prime p = a 2 + b 2 where b is even, and let q be a prime such that     (   p  q   )   =  1.        p  q   1.    (\tfrac{p}{q})=1.   Quadratic reciprocity says that      (    q  *   p   )   =  1   ,         superscript  q    p   1    (\tfrac{q^{*}}{p})=1,   where      q  *   =     (   -  1   )     q  -  1   2    q    .       superscript  q       superscript    1       q  1   2    q     q^{*}=(-1)^{\frac{q-1}{2}}q.   Let σ 2 ≡ p (mod q ). Then 22         (    q  *   p   )   4   =   (    σ   (   b  +  σ   )    q   )    .       subscript     superscript  q    p   4       σ    b  σ    q     \Bigg(\frac{q^{*}}{p}\Bigg)_{4}=\Bigg(\frac{\sigma(b+\sigma)}{q}\Bigg).   This implies 23 that        (    q  *   p   )   4   =   1  if and only if   {       b  ≡   0     (   mod  q   )     ;     or       a  ≡  0   (   mod  q   )   and   (    2  q    )   =  1  ;     or       a  ≡  μ  b  ,   μ  2   +  1  ≡   λ  2    (   mod  q   )   , and   (     λ   (   λ  +  1   )    q    )   =  1.              subscript     superscript  q    p   4     1  if and only if   cases    b   annotated  0   pmod  q     or   fragments  a   0   pmod  q   and   fragments  normal-(    2  q   normal-)    1  normal-;   or   fragments  a   μ  b  normal-,   superscript  μ  2    1    superscript  λ  2    pmod  q   , and   fragments  normal-(      λ    λ  1    q   normal-)    1.   otherwise      \Bigg(\frac{q^{*}}{p}\Bigg)_{4}=1\mbox{ if and only if }\begin{cases}b\equiv 0%

Dirichlet 25 also proved that if p ≡ 1 (mod 4) is prime and     (   17  p   )   =  1        17  p   1    (\tfrac{17}{p})=1   then         (   17  p   )   4     (   p  17   )   4    =   {       +   1   if and only if   p    =    x  2   +   17   y  2             -   1  if and only if  2  p    =    x  2   +   17   y  2                  subscript    17  p   4    subscript    p  17   4     cases        1  if and only if  p       superscript  x  2     17   superscript  y  2      otherwise        1  if and only if  2  p       superscript  x  2     17   superscript  y  2      otherwise     \Bigg(\frac{17}{p}\Bigg)_{4}\Bigg(\frac{p}{17}\Bigg)_{4}=\begin{cases}+1\mbox{%

They all assume that p = a 2 + b 2 and q = c 2 + d 2 are primes where b and d are even, and that     (   p  q   )   =  1.        p  q   1.    (\tfrac{p}{q})=1.     Gosset's version is 27         (   q  p   )   4   ≡     (     a  /  b   -   c  /  d      a  /  b   +   c  /  d     )     q  -  1   4       (   mod  q   )     .       subscript    q  p   4    annotated   superscript        a  b     c  d        a  b     c  d         q  1   4     pmod  q      \Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_{4}\equiv\Bigg(\frac{a/b-c/d}{a/b+c/d}\Bigg)^{\frac{q-%
 1}{4}}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}q).     Letting i 2 ≡ −1 (mod p ) and j 2 ≡ −1 (mod q ), Frölich's law is 28          (   q  p   )   4     (   p  q   )   4    =   (    a  +   b  j    q   )   =   (    c  +   d  i    p   )    .           subscript    q  p   4    subscript    p  q   4        a    b  j    q            c    d  i    p      \Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_{4}\Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)_{4}=\Bigg(\frac{a+bj}{q}%
 \Bigg)=\Bigg(\frac{c+di}{p}\Bigg).     Burde stated his in the form: 29 30 31          (   q  p   )   4     (   p  q   )   4    =   (     a  c   -   b  d    q   )    .         subscript    q  p   4    subscript    p  q   4          a  c     b  d    q     \Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_{4}\Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)_{4}=\Bigg(\frac{ac-bd}{q}%

Note that 32        (     a  c   +   b  d    p   )   =    (   p  q   )    (     a  c   -   b  d    p   )     .            a  c     b  d    p       p  q         a  c     b  d    p      \Bigg(\frac{ac+bd}{p}\Bigg)=\Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{ac-bd}{p}\Bigg).     Miscellany  Let p ≡ q ≡ 1 (mod 4) be primes and assume     (   p  q   )   =  1        p  q   1    (\tfrac{p}{q})=1   . Then e 2 = p f 2 + q g 2 has non-trivial integer solutions, and 33          (   p  q   )   4     (   q  p   )   4    =     (   -  1   )     f  g   2     (    -  1   e   )     .         subscript    p  q   4    subscript    q  p   4       superscript    1       f  g   2        1   e      \Bigg(\frac{p}{q}\Bigg)_{4}\Bigg(\frac{q}{p}\Bigg)_{4}=\left(-1\right)^{\frac{%

 )^{s}.     Let p = 1 + 4 x 2 be prime, let a be any odd number that divides x , and let      a  *   =     (   -  1   )     a  -  1   2    a    .       superscript  a       superscript    1       a  1   2    a     a^{*}=\left(-1\right)^{\frac{a-1}{2}}a.   Then 35  a * is a biquadratic residue (mod p ).  Let p = a 2 + 4 b 2 = c 2 + 2 d 2 ≡ 1 (mod 8) be prime. Then 36 all the divisors of c 4 − p a 2 are biquadratic residues (mod p ). The same is true for all the divisors of d 4 − p b 2 .  Gaussian integers  Background  In his second monograph on biquadratic reciprocity Gauss displays some examples and makes conjectures that imply the theorems listed above for the biquadratic character of small primes. He makes some general remarks, and admits there is no obvious general rule at work. He goes on to say   The theorems on biquadratic residues gleam with the greatest simplilcity and genuine beauty only when the field of arithmetic is extended to imaginary numbers, so that without restriction, the numbers of the form a + bi constitute the object of study ... we call such numbers integral complex numbers . 37 [bold in the original]   These numbers are now called the ring of Gaussian integers , denoted by Z [ i ]. Note that i is a fourth root of 1.  In a footnote he adds   The theory of cubic residues must be based in a similar way on a consideration of numbers of the form a + bh where h is an imaginary root of the equation h 3 = 1 ... and similarly the theory of residues of higher powers leads to the introduction of other imaginary quantities. 38   The numbers built up from a cube root of unity are now called the ring of Eisenstein integers . The "other imaginary quantities" needed for the "theory of residues of higher powers" are the rings of integers of the cyclotomic number fields ; the Gaussian and Eisenstein integers are the simplest examples of these.  Facts and terminology  Gauss develops the arithmetic theory of the "integral complex numbers" and shows that it is quite similar to the arithmetic of ordinary integers. 39 This is where the terms unit, associate, norm, and primary were introduced into mathematics.  The units are the numbers that divide 1. 40 They are 1, i , −1, and − i . They are similar to 1 and −1 in the ordinary integers, in that they divide every number. The units are the powers of i .  Given a number λ = a + bi , its conjugate is a − bi and its associates are the four numbers 41   λ = + a + bi    i λ = − b + ai   −λ = − a − bi   − i λ = + b − ai    The norm of λ = a + bi is the number Nλ = a 2 + b 2 . If λ and μ are two Gaussian integers, Nλμ = Nλ Nμ; in other words, the norm is multiplicative. 42 The norm of zero is zero, the norm of any other number is a positive integer. ε is a unit if and only if Nε = 1.  Gauss proves that Z [ i ] is a unique factorization domain and shows that the primes fall into three classes: 43   2 is a special case: 2 = i 3 (1 + i ) 2 . It is the only prime in Z divisible by the square of a prime in Z [ i ]. In algebraic number theory, 2 is said to ramify in Z [ i ].    Positive primes in Z ≡ 3 (mod 4) are also primes in Z [ i ]. In algebraic number theory, these primes are said to remain inert in Z [ i ].    Positive primes in Z ≡ 1 (mod 4) are the product of two conjugate primes in Z [ i ]. In algebraic number theory, these primes are said to split in Z [ i ].   Thus, inert primes are 3, 7, 11, 19, ... and a factorization of the split primes is   5 = (2 + i ) × (2 − i ),  13 = (2 + 3 i ) × (2 − 3 i ),  17 = (4 + i ) × (4 − i ),  29 = (2 + 5 i ) × (2 − 5 i ), ...   The associates and conjugate of a prime are also primes.  Note that the norm of an inert prime q is N q = q 2 ≡ 1 (mod 4); thus the norm of all primes other than 1 + i and its associates is ≡ 1 (mod 4).  Gauss calls a number in Z [ i ] odd if its norm is an odd integer. 44 Thus all primes except 1 + i and its associates are odd. The product of two odd numbers is odd and the conjugate and associates of an odd number are odd.  In order to state the unique factorization theorem, it is necessary to have a way of distinguishing one of the associates of a number. Gauss defines 45 an odd number to be primary if it is ≡ 1 (mod (1 + i ) 3 ). It is straightforward to show that every odd number has exactly one primary associate. An odd number λ = a + bi is primary if a + b ≡ a − b ≡ 1 (mod 4); i.e., a ≡ 1 and b ≡ 0, or a ≡ 3 and b ≡ 2 (mod 4). 46 The product of two primary numbers is primary and the conjugate of a primary number is also primary.  The unique factorization theorem 47 for Z [ i ] is: if λ ≠ 0, then      λ  =    i  μ     (   1  +  i   )   ν    π  1   α  1     π  2   α  2     π  3   α  3    …       λ     superscript  i  μ    superscript    1  i   ν    superscript   subscript  π  1    subscript  α  1     superscript   subscript  π  2    subscript  α  2     superscript   subscript  π  3    subscript  α  3    normal-…     \lambda=i^{\mu}(1+i)^{\nu}\pi_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}\pi_{2}^{\alpha_{2}}\pi_{3}^{%
 \alpha_{3}}\dots   where 0 ≤ μ ≤ 3, ν ≥ 0, the π i s are primary primes and the α i s ≥ 1, and this representation is unique, up to the order of the factors.  The notions of congruence 48 and greatest common divisor 49 are defined the same way in Z [ i ] as they are for the ordinary integers Z . Because the units divide all numbers, a congruence (mod λ) is also true modulo any associate of λ, and any associate of a GCD is also a GCD.  Quartic residue character  Gauss proves the analogue of Fermat's theorem : if α is not divisible by an odd prime π, then 50       α    N  π   -  1    ≡   1     (   mod  π   )         superscript  α      N  π   1     annotated  1   pmod  π      \alpha^{N\pi-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\pi)   Since Nπ ≡ 1 (mod 4),    α     N  π   -  1   4      superscript  α        N  π   1   4     \alpha^{\frac{N\pi-1}{4}}   makes sense, and     α     N  π   -  1   4    ≡    i  k      (   mod  π   )         superscript  α        N  π   1   4     annotated   superscript  i  k    pmod  π      \alpha^{\frac{N\pi-1}{4}}\equiv i^{k}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\pi)   for a unique unit i k .  This unit is called the quartic or biquadratic residue character of α (mod π) and is denoted by 51 52        [   α  π   ]   =   i  k   ≡    α     N  π   -  1   4       (   mod  π   )     .         delimited-[]    α  π     superscript  i  k         annotated   superscript  α        N  π   1   4     pmod  π       \left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right]=i^{k}\equiv\alpha^{\frac{N\pi-1}{4}}\;\;(%

It has formal properties similar to those of the Legendre symbol . 53   The congruence     x  4   ≡   α     (   mod  π   )         superscript  x  4    annotated  α   pmod  π      x^{4}\equiv\alpha\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\pi)   is solvable in Z [ i ] if and only if     [   α  π   ]   =  1.       delimited-[]    α  π    1.    \left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\right]=1.    54         [    α  β   π   ]   =    [   α  π   ]    [   β  π   ]         delimited-[]      α  β   π       delimited-[]    α  π     delimited-[]    β  π       \Bigg[\frac{\alpha\beta}{\pi}\Bigg]=\Bigg[\frac{\alpha}{\pi}\Bigg]\Bigg[\frac{%

As in that case, if the "denominator" is composite, the symbol can equal one without the conguence being solvable:       [   α  λ   ]   =     [   α   π  1    ]    α  1      [   α   π  2    ]    α  2    …        delimited-[]    α  λ       superscript   delimited-[]    α   subscript  π  1      subscript  α  1     superscript   delimited-[]    α   subscript  π  2      subscript  α  2    normal-…     \left[\frac{\alpha}{\lambda}\right]=\left[\frac{\alpha}{\pi_{1}}\right]^{%

Statements of the theorem  Gauss stated the law of biquadratic reciprocity in this form: 56 57  Let π and θ be distinct primary primes of Z [ i ]. Then   if either π or θ or both are ≡ 1 (mod 4), then      [   π  θ   ]   =   [   θ  π   ]    ,       delimited-[]    π  θ     delimited-[]    θ  π      \Bigg[\frac{\pi}{\theta}\Bigg]=\left[\frac{\theta}{\pi}\right],   but    if both π and θ are ≡ 3 + 2 i (mod 4), then      [   π  θ   ]   =   -   [   θ  π   ]     .       delimited-[]    π  θ       delimited-[]    θ  π       \Bigg[\frac{\pi}{\theta}\Bigg]=-\left[\frac{\theta}{\pi}\right].      Just as the quadratic reciprocity law for the Legendre symbol is also true for the Jacobi symbol, the requirement that the numbers be prime is not needed; it suffices that they be odd relatively prime nonunits. 58 Probably the most well-known statement is:  Let π and θ be primary relatively prime nonunits. Then 59         [   π  θ   ]     [   θ  π   ]    -  1     =    (   -  1   )       N  π   -  1   4      N  θ   -  1   4      .         delimited-[]    π  θ     superscript   delimited-[]    θ  π      1      superscript    1           N  π   1   4         N  θ   1   4       \Bigg[\frac{\pi}{\theta}\Bigg]\left[\frac{\theta}{\pi}\right]^{-1}=(-1)^{\frac%
 {N\pi-1}{4}\frac{N\theta-1}{4}}.     There are supplementary theorems 60 61 for the units and the half-even prime 1 + i .  if π = a + bi is a primary prime, then         [   i  π   ]   =   i   -    a  -  1   2      ,    [    1  +  i   π   ]   =   i    a  -  b  -  1  -   b  2    4      ,     formulae-sequence     delimited-[]    i  π     superscript  i        a  1   2         delimited-[]      1  i   π     superscript  i      a  b  1   superscript  b  2    4       \Bigg[\frac{i}{\pi}\Bigg]=i^{-\frac{a-1}{2}},\;\;\;\Bigg[\frac{1+i}{\pi}\Bigg]%
 =i^{\frac{a-b-1-b^{2}}{4}},     and thus         [    -  1   π   ]   =    (   -  1   )     a  -  1   2     ,    [   2  π   ]   =   i   -   b  2       .     formulae-sequence     delimited-[]      1   π     superscript    1       a  1   2        delimited-[]    2  π     superscript  i      b  2        \Bigg[\frac{-1}{\pi}\Bigg]=(-1)^{\frac{a-1}{2}},\;\;\;\Bigg[\frac{2}{\pi}\Bigg%
 ]=i^{-\frac{b}{2}}.     Also, if π = a + bi is a primary prime, and b ≠ 0 then 62       [    π  ¯   π   ]   =    [    -  2   π   ]     (   -  1   )      a  2   -  1   8          delimited-[]     normal-¯  π   π       delimited-[]      2   π     superscript    1        superscript  a  2   1   8       \Bigg[\frac{\overline{\pi}}{\pi}\Bigg]=\Bigg[\frac{-2}{\pi}\Bigg](-1)^{\frac{a%
 ^{2}-1}{8}}   (if b = 0 the symbol is 0).  Jacobi defined π = a + bi to be primary if a ≡ 1 (mod 4). With this normalization, the law takes the form 63  Let α = a + bi and β = c + di where a ≡ c ≡ 1 (mod 4) and b and d are even be relatively prime nonunits. Then        [   α  β   ]     [   β  α   ]    -  1     =    (   -  1   )     b  d   4           delimited-[]    α  β     superscript   delimited-[]    β  α      1      superscript    1       b  d   4      \left[\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right]\left[\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\right]^{-1}=(-1)^{%

Then         [   α  β   ]     [   β  α   ]    -  1     =    (   -  1   )     b  d   +     a  -  1   2   d   +     c  -  1   2   b      ,    [    1  +  i   α   ]   =   i     b   (   a  -   3  b    )    2   -     a  2   -  1   8         formulae-sequence       delimited-[]    α  β     superscript   delimited-[]    β  α      1      superscript    1       b  d         a  1   2   d         c  1   2   b         delimited-[]      1  i   α     superscript  i        b    a    3  b     2        superscript  a  2   1   8        \left[\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right]\left[\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\right]^{-1}=(-1)^{%

 \frac{b(a-3b)}{2}-\frac{a^{2}-1}{8}}     The law can be stated without using the concept of primary:  If λ is odd, let ε(λ) be the unique unit congruent to λ (mod (1 + i ) 3 ); i.e., ε(λ) = i k ≡ λ (mod 2 + 2 i ), where 0 ≤ k ≤ 3. Then 65 for odd and relatively prime α and β, neither one a unit,        [   α  β   ]     [   β  α   ]    -  1     =     (   -  1   )       N  α   -  1   4      N  β   -  1   4     ϵ    (  α  )      N  β   -  1   4    ϵ    (  β  )      N  α   -  1   4            delimited-[]    α  β     superscript   delimited-[]    β  α      1        superscript    1           N  α   1   4         N  β   1   4     ϵ   superscript  α        N  β   1   4    ϵ   superscript  β        N  α   1   4       \left[\frac{\alpha}{\beta}\right]\left[\frac{\beta}{\alpha}\right]^{-1}=(-1)^{%
