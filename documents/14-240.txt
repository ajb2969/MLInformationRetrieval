   Rotation map      Rotation map   In mathematics , a rotation map is a function that represents an undirected edge- labeled graph , where each vertex enumerates its outgoing neighbors. Rotation maps were first introduced by Reingold, Vadhan and Wigderson (“Entropy waves, the zig-zag graph product, and new constant-degree expanders”, 2002) in order to conveniently define the zig-zag product and prove its properties. Given a vertex   v   v   v   and an edge label   i   i   i   , the rotation map returns the   i   i   i   'th neighbor of   v   v   v   and the edge label that would lead back to   v   v   v   .  Definition  For a D -regular graph G , the rotation map     Rot  G   :     [  N  ]   ×   [  D  ]    →    [  N  ]   ×   [  D  ]        normal-:   subscript  Rot  G    normal-→     delimited-[]  N    delimited-[]  D       delimited-[]  N    delimited-[]  D       \mathrm{Rot}_{G}:[N]\times[D]\rightarrow[N]\times[D]   is defined as follows      Rot  G    (  v  ,  i  )    =   (  w  ,  j  )          subscript  Rot  G    v  i     w  j     \mathrm{Rot}_{G}(v,i)=(w,j)   if the i th edge leaving v leads to w , and the j th edge leaving w leads to v .  Basic properties  From the definition we see that    Rot  G     subscript  Rot  G    \mathrm{Rot}_{G}   is a permutation, and moreover     Rot  G   ∘   Rot  G        subscript  Rot  G    subscript  Rot  G     \mathrm{Rot}_{G}\circ\mathrm{Rot}_{G}   is the identity map (    Rot  G     subscript  Rot  G    \mathrm{Rot}_{G}   is an involution ).  Special cases and properties   A rotation map is consistently labeled if all of the edges leaving each vertex are labeled in such a way that at each vertex, the labels of the incoming edges are all distinct. Every regular graph has some consistent labeling.  A rotation map is   π   π   \pi   -consistent if     ∀    v    Rot  G    (  v  ,  i  )     =   (   v   [  i  ]    ,   π   (  i  )    )        for-all    v   subscript  Rot  G    v  i        v   delimited-[]  i      π  i      \forall v\ \mathrm{Rot}_{G}(v,i)=(v[i],\pi(i))   . From the definition, a   π   π   \pi   -consistent rotation map is consistently labeled.
