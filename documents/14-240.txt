Rotation map

In mathematics, a rotation map is a function that represents an undirected edge-labeled graph, where each vertex enumerates its outgoing neighbors. Rotation maps were first introduced by Reingold, Vadhan and Wigderson (“Entropy waves, the zig-zag graph product, and new constant-degree expanders”, 2002) in order to conveniently define the zig-zag product and prove its properties. Given a vertex 
 
 
 
  and an edge label 
 
 
 
 , the rotation map returns the 
 
 
 
 'th neighbor of 
 
 
 
  and the edge label that would lead back to 
 
 
 
 .
Definition
For a D-regular graph G, the rotation map 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows
 
 
 
  if the ith edge leaving v leads to w, and the jth edge leaving w leads to v.
Basic properties
From the definition we see that 
 
 
 
  is a permutation, and moreover 
 
 
 
  is the identity map (
 
 
 
  is an involution).
Special cases and properties

A rotation map is consistently labeled if all of the edges leaving each vertex are labeled in such a way that at each vertex, the labels of the incoming edges are all distinct. Every regular graph has some consistent labeling.
A rotation map is 
 
 
 
 -consistent if 
 
 
 
 . From the definition, a 
 
 
 
 -consistent rotation map is consistently labeled.
