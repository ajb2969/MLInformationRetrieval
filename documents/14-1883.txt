Weight-of-conflict conjecture

Weight-of-conflict conjecture was proposed by Glenn Shafer in his book on the Dempster–Shafer theory titled A Mathematical Theory of Evidence.
It states that if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are commonality functions for two separable support functions

 
  and 
 
 
 
  defined over 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , then the corresponding weights of conflict satisfy the condition 
 
 
 
 .
