   Weight-of-conflict conjecture      Weight-of-conflict conjecture   Weight-of-conflict conjecture was proposed by Glenn Shafer in his book on the Dempster–Shafer theory titled A Mathematical Theory of Evidence .  It states that if    Q  1     subscript  Q  1    Q_{1}   and    Q  2     subscript  Q  2    Q_{2}   are commonality functions for two separable  support functions     S  1     subscript  S  1    S_{1}   and    S  2     subscript  S  2    S_{2}   defined over   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   , and      Q  1    (  A  )    ≤    Q  2    (  A  )           subscript  Q  1   A      subscript  Q  2   A     Q_{1}(A)\leq Q_{2}(A)   , then the corresponding weights of conflict satisfy the condition     W   S  1    ≥   W   S  2         subscript  W   subscript  S  1     subscript  W   subscript  S  2      W_{S_{1}}\geq W_{S_{2}}   .        ∀  A   ⊆  Θ   :     Q  1    (  A  )    ≤    Q  2    (  A  )    ⟹   W   S  1    ≥   W   S  2        normal-:     for-all  A   normal-Θ          subscript  Q  1   A      subscript  Q  2   A         subscript  W   subscript  S  1          subscript  W   subscript  S  2        \forall A\subseteq\Theta:Q_{1}(A)\leq Q_{2}(A)\implies W_{S_{1}}\geq W_{S_{2}}     References     Further reading     "  Category:Dempster–Shafer theory
