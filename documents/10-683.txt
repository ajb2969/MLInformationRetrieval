   7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP+)      7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a 7beta-hydroxysteroid + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 7-oxosteroid + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 7beta-hydroxysteroid and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 7-oxosteroid , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 7beta-hydroxysteroid:NADP + 7-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADP + -dependent 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , and 7beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (NADP + ) .
