CAT(k) space

In mathematics, a 
 
 
space, where 
 
 
 
  is a real number, is a specific type of metric space. Intuitively, triangles in a 
 
 
 
  space are "slimmer" than corresponding "model triangles" in a standard space of constant curvature

 
 . In a 
 
 
 
  space, the curvature is bounded from above by 
 
 
 
 . A notable special case is 
 
 
complete

 
  spaces are known as Hadamard spaces after the French mathematician Jacques Hadamard.
Originally, Alexandrov called these spaces “
 
 
 
  domain”. The terminology 
 
 
 
  was coined by Mikhail Gromov in 1987 and is an acronym for Élie Cartan, Aleksandr Danilovich Aleksandrov and Victor Andreevich Toponogov (although Toponogov never explored curvature bounded above in publications).
Definitions

Model triangles in spaces of positive (top), negative (middle) and zero (bottom) curvature.

For a real number

 
 , let 
 
 
 
  denote the unique simply connected surface (real 2-dimensional Riemannian manifold) with constant curvature 
 
 
 
 . Denote by 
 
 
 
  the diameter of 
 
 
 
 , which is 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a geodesic metric space, i.e. a metric space for which every two points 
 
 
 
  can be joined by a geodesic segment, an arc length parametrized continuous curve

 
 , whose length



is precisely 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a triangle in 
 
 
 
  with geodesic segments as its sides. 
 
 
 
  is said to satisfy the 
 
 
inequality if there is a comparison triangle

 
  in the model space 
 
 
 
 , with sides of the same length as the sides of 
 
 
 
 , such that distances between points on 
 
 
 
  are less than or equal to the distances between corresponding points on 
 
 
 
 .
The geodesic metric space 
 
 
 
  is said to be a 
 
 
space if every geodesic triangle 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  with perimeter less than 
 
 
 
  satisfies the 
 
 
 
  inequality. A (not-necessarily-geodesic) metric space 
 
 
 
  is said to be a space with curvature 
 
 
 
  if every point of 
 
 
 
  has a geodesically convex

neighbourhood. A space with curvature 
 
 
 
  may be said to have non-positive curvature.
Examples

Any 
 
 
 
  space 
 
 
 
  is also a 
 
 
 
  space for all 
 
 
 
 . In fact, the converse holds: if 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
  space for all 
 
 
 
 , then it is a 
 
 
 
  space.


 
 -dimensional Euclidean space

 
  with its usual metric is a 
 
 
 
  space. More generally, any real inner product space (not necessarily complete) is a 
 
 
 
  space; conversely, if a real normed vector space is a 
 
 
 
  space for some real 
 
 
 
 , then it is an inner product space.


 
 -dimensional hyperbolic space

 
  with its usual metric is a 
 
 
 
  space, and hence a 
 
 
 
  space as well.
The 
 
 
 
 -dimensional unit sphere

 
  is a 
 
 
 
  space.
More generally, the standard space 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
  space. So, for example, regardless of dimension, the sphere of radius 
 
 
 
  (and constant curvature 
 
 
 
 ) is a 
 
 
 
  space. Note that the diameter of the sphere is 
 
 
 
  (as measured on the surface of the sphere) not 
 
 
 
  (as measured by going through the centre of the sphere).
The punctured plane

 
  is not a 
 
 
 
  space since it is not geodesically convex (for example, the points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  cannot be joined by a geodesic in 
 
 
 
  with arc length 2), but every point of 
 
 
 
  does have a 
 
 
 
  geodesically convex neighbourhood, so 
 
 
 
  is a space of curvature 
 
 
 
 .
The closed subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  given by










equipped with the induced length metric is not a 
 
 
 
  space for any 
 
 
 
 .
 


Any product of 
 
 
 
  spaces is 
 
 
 
 . (This does not hold for negative arguments.)

Hadamard spaces
As a special case, a complete CAT(0) space is also known as a Hadamard space; this is by analogy with the situation for Hadamard manifolds. A Hadamard space is contractible (it has the homotopy type of a single point) and, between any two points of a Hadamard space, there is a unique geodesic segment connecting them (in fact, both properties also hold for general, possibly incomplete, CAT(0) spaces). Most importantly, distance functions in Hadamard spaces are convex: if σ1, σ2 are two geodesics in X defined on the same interval of time I, then the function I → R given by



is convex in t.
Properties of 
 
 
 
  spaces
Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
  space. Then the following properties hold:

Given any two points 
 
 
 
  (with 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 ), there is a unique geodesic segment that joins 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 ; moreover, this segment varies continuously as a function of its endpoints.


Every local geodesic in 
 
 
 
  with length at most 
 
 
 
  is a geodesic.


The 
 
 
 
 -balls in 
 
 
 
  of radius less than 
 
 
 
  are (geodesically) convex.


The 
 
 
 
 -balls in 
 
 
 
  of radius less than 
 
 
 
  are contractible.


Approximate midpoints are close to midpoints in the following sense: for every 
 
 
 
  there exists a 
 
 
 
  such that, if 
 
 
 
  is the midpoint of a geodesic segment from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and










then 
 
 
 
 .
 


It follows from these properties that, for 
 
 
 
  the universal cover of every 
 
 
 
  space is contractible; in particular, the higher homotopy groups of such a space are trivial. As the example of the 
 
 
 
 -sphere 
 
 
 
  shows, there is, in general, no hope for a 
 
 
 
  space to be contractible if 
 
 
 
 .


An 
 
 
 
 -dimensional 
 
 
 
  space equipped with the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Hausdorff measure satisfies the $\operatorname{CD}[n, (n-1)k]$ condition in the sense of Lott-Villani-Sturm .
