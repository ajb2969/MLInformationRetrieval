Falconer's conjecture

In geometric measure theory, Falconer's conjecture, named after Kenneth Falconer, is an unsolved problem concerning the sets of Euclidean distances between points in d-dimensional spaces. Intuitively, it states that a set of points that is large in its Hausdorff dimension must determine a set of distances that is large in measure. More precisely, if S is a set of points in d-dimensional Euclidean space whose Hausdorff dimension is strictly greater than d/2, then the conjecture states that the set of distances between pairs of points in S must have nonzero Lebesgue measure.
proved that sets with Hausdorff dimension greater than (d + 1)/2 have distance sets with nonzero measure.1 He motivated this result as a multidimensional generalization of the Steinhaus theorem, a previous result of Hugo Steinhaus proving that every set of real numbers with nonzero measure must have a difference set that contains an interval of the form

For points in the Euclidean plane, a variant of Falconer's conjecture states that a compact set whose Hausdorff dimension is greater than or equal to one must have a distance set of Hausdorff dimension one. Falconer himself showed that this is true for compact sets with Hausdorff dimension at least 3/2, and subsequent results lowered this bound to 4/3.45 It is also known that, for a compact planar set with Hausdorff dimension at least one, the distance set must have Hausdorff dimension at least 1/2.6 Proving a bound strictly greater than 1/2 for the dimension of the distance set in this case would be equivalent to resolving several other unsolved conjectures, including a conjecture of Paul Erdős on the existence of Borel subrings of the real numbers with fractional Hausdorff dimension, and a variant of the Kakeya set problem on the Hausdorff dimension of sets such that, for every possible direction, there is a line segment whose intersection with the set has high Hausdorff dimension.7
For non-Euclidean distance functions in the plane defined by polygonal norms, the analogue of the Falconer conjecture is false: there exist sets of Hausdorff dimension two whose distance sets have measure zero.89
