List of equations in fluid mechanics

This article summarizes equations in the theory of fluid mechanics.
Definitions
(Figure)
Flux F through a surface, dS is the differential vector area element, n is the unit normal to the surface. Left: No flux passes in the surface, the maximum amount flows normal to the surface. Right: The reduction in flux passing through a surface can be visualized by reduction in F or dS equivalently (resolved into components, θ is angle to normal n). F•dS is the component of flux passing though the surface, multiplied by the area of the surface (see dot product). For this reason flux represents physically a flow per unit area.

Here 
 
 
 
  is a unit vector in the direction of the flow/current/flux.
