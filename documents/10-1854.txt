   Petromyzonol sulfotransferase      Petromyzonol sulfotransferase   In enzymology , a petromyzonol sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + 5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + 5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 24-sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and 5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrol , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and 5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-triol 24-sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:5alpha-cholan-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-te trol sulfotransferase . This enzyme is also called PZ-SULT .
