   Quot scheme      Quot scheme   In algebraic geometry, the Quot scheme is a scheme parametrizing locally free sheaves on a projective scheme . More specifically, if X is a projective scheme over a Noetherian scheme S and if F is a coherent sheaf on X , then there is a scheme     Quot  F    (  X  )       subscript  Quot  F   X    \operatorname{Quot}_{F}(X)   whose set of T -points       Quot  F    (  X  )     (  T  )    =    Mor  S    (  T  ,    Quot  F    (  X  )    )           subscript  Quot  F   X   T     subscript  Mor  S   T    subscript  Quot  F   X      \operatorname{Quot}_{F}(X)(T)=\operatorname{Mor}_{S}(T,\operatorname{Quot}_{F}%
 (X))   is the set of isomorphism classes of the quotients of    F   √ó  S   T      subscript   S   F  T    F\times_{S}T   that are flat over T . The notion was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck .  It is typically used to construct another scheme parametrizing geometric objects that are of interest such as a Hilbert scheme . (In fact, taking F to be the structure sheaf    ùí™  X     subscript  ùí™  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   gives a Hilbert scheme.)  References   Nitsure, N. Construction of Hilbert and Quot schemes.
