Quot scheme

In algebraic geometry, the Quot scheme is a scheme parametrizing locally free sheaves on a projective scheme. More specifically, if X is a projective scheme over a Noetherian scheme S and if F is a coherent sheaf on X, then there is a scheme 
 
 
 
  whose set of T-points 
 
 
 
  is the set of isomorphism classes of the quotients of 
 
 
 
  that are flat over T. The notion was introduced by Alexander Grothendieck.
It is typically used to construct another scheme parametrizing geometric objects that are of interest such as a Hilbert scheme. (In fact, taking F to be the structure sheaf 
 
 
 
  gives a Hilbert scheme.)
