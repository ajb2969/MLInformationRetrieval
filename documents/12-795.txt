Blue is a hyperbolic trajectory ( e > 1). Green is a parabolic trajectory ( e = 1). Red is an elliptical orbit (0  r(\nu) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos(\nu)}  where:      r   r   r   is the distance     a   a   a   is the semi-major axis , which defines the size of the orbit     e   e   e   is the eccentricity , which defines the shape of the orbit     ν   ν   \nu   is the true anomaly , which is the angle between the current position of the orbiting object and the location in the orbit at which it is closest to the central body (called the periapsis )   Alternately, the equation can be expressed as:       r   (  ν  )    =   p   1  +   e   cos   (  ν  )             r  ν     p    1    e    ν        r(\nu)=\frac{p}{1+e\cos(\nu)}     Where   p   p   p   is called the semi-latus rectum of the curve. This form of the equation is particularly useful when dealing with parabolic trajectories, for which the semi-major axis is infinite.  Despite developing these laws from observations, Kepler was never able to develop a theory to explain these motions. 1  Isaac Newton  Between 1665 to 1666, Isaac Newton developed several concepts related to motion, gravitation and differential calculus. However, these concepts were not published until 1687 in the Principia , in which he outlined his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation . His second of his three laws of motion states:   The acceleration a of a body is parallel and directly proportional to the net force acting on the body, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the body:      𝐅  =   m  𝐚   =   m     d  2   𝐫    d   t  2            𝐅    m  𝐚          m       superscript  d  2   𝐫     d   superscript  t  2         \mathbf{F}=m\mathbf{a}=m\frac{d^{2}\mathbf{r}}{dt^{2}}     Where:      𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   is the force vector     m   m   m   is the mass of the body on which the force is acting     𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   is the acceleration vector, the second time derivative of the position vector   𝐫   𝐫   \mathbf{r}       Strictly speaking, this form of the equation only applies to an object of constant mass, which holds true based on the simplifying assumptions made below.  (Figure)  The mechanisms of Newton's law of universal gravitation; a point mass m 1 attracts another point mass m 2 by a force F 2 which is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance ( r ) between them. Regardless of masses or distance, the magnitudes of | F 1 | and | F 2 | will always be equal. G is the gravitational constant .   Newton's law of gravitation states:   Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the point masses:      F  =   G     m  1    m  2     r  2         F    G       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2     superscript  r  2       F=G\frac{m_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}     where:      F   F   F   is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two point masses     G   G   G   is the gravitational constant      m  1     subscript  m  1    m_{1}   is the mass of the first point mass      m  2     subscript  m  2    m_{2}   is the mass of the second point mass     r   r   r   is the distance between the two point masses    From the laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, Newton was able to derive Kepler's laws, demonstrating consistency between observation and theory. The laws of Kepler and Newton formed the basis of modern celestial mechanics until Albert Einstein introduced the concepts of special and general relativity in the early 20th century. For most applications, Keplerian motion approximates the motions of planets and satellites to relatively high degrees of accuracy and is used extensively in astronomy and astrodynamics .  Simplified two body problem  (See also Orbit Analysis )  To solve for the motion of an object in a two body system , two simplifying assumptions can be made:   1. The bodies are spherically symmetric and can be treated as point masses.  2. There are no external or internal forces acting upon the bodies other than their mutual gravitation.   The shapes of large celestial bodies are close to spheres. By symmetry, the net gravitational force attracting a mass point towards a homogeneous sphere must be directed towards its centre. The shell theorem (also proven by Isaac Newton) states that the magnitude of this force is the same as if all mass was concentrated in the middle of the sphere, even if the density of the sphere varies with depth (as it does for most celestial bodies). From this immediately follows that the attraction between two homogeneous spheres is as if both had its mass concentrated to its center.  Smaller objects, like asteroids or spacecraft often have a shape strongly deviating from a sphere. But the gravitational forces produced by these irregularities are generally small compared to the gravity of the central body. The difference between an irregular shape and a perfect sphere also diminishes with distances, and most orbital distances are very large when compared with the diameter of a small orbiting body. Thus for some applications, shape irregularity can be neglected without significant impact on accuracy.  Planets rotate at varying rates and thus may take a slightly oblate shape because of the centrifugal force. With such an oblate shape, the gravitational attraction will deviate somewhat from that of a homogeneous sphere. This phenomenon is quite noticeable for artificial Earth satellites, especially those in low orbits. At larger distances the effect of this oblateness becomes negligible. Planetary motions in the Solar System can be computed with sufficient precision if they are treated as point masses.  Two point mass objects with masses    m  1     subscript  m  1    m_{1}   and    m  2     subscript  m  2    m_{2}   and position vectors    𝐫  1     subscript  𝐫  1    \mathbf{r}_{1}   and    𝐫  2     subscript  𝐫  2    \mathbf{r}_{2}   relative to some inertial reference frame experience gravitational forces:        m  1     𝐫  ¨   1    =     -   G   m  1    m  2      r  2     𝐫  ^           subscript  m  1    subscript   normal-¨  𝐫   1            G   subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2      superscript  r  2     normal-^  𝐫      m_{1}\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{1}=\frac{-Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}           m  2     𝐫  ¨   2    =     G   m  1    m  2     r  2     𝐫  ^           subscript  m  2    subscript   normal-¨  𝐫   2          G   subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2     superscript  r  2     normal-^  𝐫      m_{2}\ddot{\mathbf{r}}_{2}=\frac{Gm_{1}m_{2}}{r^{2}}\mathbf{\hat{r}}     where   𝐫   𝐫   \mathbf{r}   is the relative position vector of mass 1 with respect to mass 2, expressed as:      𝐫  =    𝐫  1   -   𝐫  2        𝐫     subscript  𝐫  1    subscript  𝐫  2      \mathbf{r}=\mathbf{r}_{1}-\mathbf{r}_{2}     and    𝐫  ^     normal-^  𝐫    \mathbf{\hat{r}}   is the unit vector in that direction and   r   r   r   is the length of that vector.  Dividing by their respective masses and subtracting the second equation from the first yields the equation of motion for the acceleration of the first object with respect to the second:  = - \frac{\mu}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}}| 1 }}  where   μ   μ   \mu   is the gravitational parameter and is equal to      μ  =   G   (    m  1   +   m  2    )        μ    G     subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2       \mu=G(m_{1}+m_{2})     In many applications, a third simplifying assumption can be made:   3. When compared to the central body, the mass of the orbiting body is insignificant. Mathematically, m 1 >> m 2 , so μ = G ( m 1 + m 2 ) ≈ Gm 1 .   This assumption is not necessary to solve the simplified two body problem, but it simplifies calculations, particularly with Earth-orbiting satellites and planets orbiting the sun. Even Jupiter 's mass is less than the sun's by a factor of 1047, 2 which would constitute an error of 0.096% in the value of μ. Notable exceptions include the Earth-moon system (mass ratio of 81.3), the Pluto-Charon system (mass ratio of 8.9) and binary star systems.  Under these assumptions the differential equation for the two body case can be completely solved mathematically and the resulting orbit which follows Kepler's laws of planetary motion is called a "Kepler orbit". The orbits of all planets are to high accuracy Kepler orbits around the Sun. The small deviations are due to the much weaker gravitational attractions between the planets, and in the case of Mercury , due to general relativity . The orbits of the artificial satellites around the Earth are, with a fair approximation, Kepler orbits with small perturbations due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, the moon and the oblateness of the Earth. In high accuracy applications for which the equation of motion must be integrated numerically with all gravitational and non-gravitational forces (such as solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag ) being taken into account, the Kepler orbit concepts are of paramount importance and heavily used.  Keplerian elements    It is worth mentioning that any Keplerian trajectory can be defined by six parameters. The motion of an object moving in three-dimensional space is characterized by a position vector and a velocity vector. Each vector has three components, so the total number of values needed to define a trajectory through space is six. An orbit is generally defined by six elements (known as Keplerian elements ) that can be computed from position and velocity, three of which have already been discussed. These elements are convenient in that of the six, five are unchanging for an unperturbed orbit (a stark contrast to two constantly changing vectors). The future location of an object within its orbit can be predicted and its new position and velocity can be easily obtained from the orbital elements.  Two define the size and shape of the trajectory:   Semimajor axis (   a   a   a\,\!   )  Eccentricity (   e   e   e\,\!   )   Three define the orientation of the orbital plane :   Inclination (   i   i   i\,\!   ) defines the angle between the orbital plane and the reference plane.  Longitude of the ascending node (   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega\,\!   ) defines the angle between the reference direction and the upward crossing of the orbit on the reference plane (the ascending node).  Argument of periapsis (   ω   ω   \omega\,\!   ) defines the angle between the ascending node and the periapsis.   And finally:   True anomaly (   ν   ν   \nu   ) defines the position of the orbiting body along the trajectory, measured from periapsis. Several alternate values can be used instead of true anomaly, the most common being   M   M   M   the mean anomaly and   T   T   T   , the time since periapsis.   Because   i   i   i   ,   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   and   ω   ω   \omega   are simply angular measurements defining the orientation of the trajectory in the reference frame, they are not strictly necessary when discussing the motion of the object within the orbital plane. They have been mentioned here for completeness, but are not required for the proofs below.

 \mathbb{0}+\mathbb{0}=\mathbb{0}    Since the cross product of the position vector and its velocity stays constant, they must lie in the same plane, orthogonal to   ℍ   ℍ   \mathbb{H}   . This implies the vector function is a plane curve . Because the equation has symmetry around its origin, it is easier to solve in polar coordinates. However, it is important to note that equation () refers to linear acceleration    (   𝕣  ¨   )     normal-¨  𝕣    \left(\ddot{\mathbb{r}}\right)   , as opposed to angular    (   θ  ¨   )     normal-¨  θ    \left(\ddot{\theta}\right)   or radial    (   r  ¨   )     normal-¨  r    \left(\ddot{r}\right)   acceleration. Therefore, one must be cautious when transforming the equation.

The distance to the focal point is a function of the polar angle relative to the horizontal line as given by the equation ()   The point on the horizontal line going out to the right from the focal point is the point with    θ  =   0       θ  0    \theta=0\,   for which the distance to the focus takes the minimal value    p   1  +  e       p    1  e     \frac{p}{1+e}   , the pericentre.

For the hyperbola the range for    θ    θ   \theta\,   is      [    -    cos   -  1     (   -   1  e    )     <  θ  <    cos   -  1     (   -   1  e    )     ]     delimited-[]          superscript     1        1  e      θ         superscript     1        1  e         \left[-\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{e}\right)<\theta<\cos^{-1}\left(-\frac{1}{e}%

For an elliptic orbit one switches to the " eccentric anomaly " E for which      and consequently      and the angular momentum H is     Integrating with respect to time t one gets     under the assumption that time    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   is selected such that the integration constant is zero.

The parameters of the osculating Kepler orbit will then only slowly change and the osculating Kepler orbit is a good approximation to the real orbit for a considerable time period before and after the time of osculation.  This concept can also be useful for a rocket during powered flight as it then tells which Kepler orbit the rocket would continue in in case the thrust is switched off.
