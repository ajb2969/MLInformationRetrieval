Kepler orbit

[[File:OrbitalEccentricityDemo.svg|thumb|300px|A diagram of the various forms of the Kepler Orbit and their eccentricities. Blue is a hyperbolic trajectory (e > 1). Green is a parabolic trajectory (e = 1). Red is an elliptical orbit (0  r(\nu) = \frac{a(1-e^2)}{1+e\cos(\nu)} 
where:



 
  is the distance


 
  is the semi-major axis, which defines the size of the orbit


 
  is the eccentricity, which defines the shape of the orbit


 
  is the true anomaly, which is the angle between the current position of the orbiting object and the location in the orbit at which it is closest to the central body (called the periapsis)

Alternately, the equation can be expressed as:



Where 
 
 
 
  is called the semi-latus rectum of the curve. This form of the equation is particularly useful when dealing with parabolic trajectories, for which the semi-major axis is infinite.
Despite developing these laws from observations, Kepler was never able to develop a theory to explain these motions.1
Isaac Newton
Between 1665 to 1666, Isaac Newton developed several concepts related to motion, gravitation and differential calculus. However, these concepts were not published until 1687 in the Principia, in which he outlined his laws of motion and his law of universal gravitation. His second of his three laws of motion states:

The acceleration a of a body is parallel and directly proportional to the net force acting on the body, is in the direction of the net force, and is inversely proportional to the mass of the body:



Where:



 
  is the force vector


 
  is the mass of the body on which the force is acting


 
  is the acceleration vector, the second time derivative of the position vector 
 
 



Strictly speaking, this form of the equation only applies to an object of constant mass, which holds true based on the simplifying assumptions made below.
(Figure)
The mechanisms of Newton's law of universal gravitation; a point mass m1 attracts another point mass m2 by a force F2 which is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance (r) between them. Regardless of masses or distance, the magnitudes of |F1| and |F2| will always be equal. G is the gravitational constant.

Newton's law of gravitation states:

Every point mass attracts every other point mass by a force pointing along the line intersecting both points. The force is proportional to the product of the two masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the point masses:



where:



 
  is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two point masses


 
  is the gravitational constant


 
  is the mass of the first point mass


 
  is the mass of the second point mass


 
  is the distance between the two point masses


From the laws of motion and the law of universal gravitation, Newton was able to derive Kepler's laws, demonstrating consistency between observation and theory. The laws of Kepler and Newton formed the basis of modern celestial mechanics until Albert Einstein introduced the concepts of special and general relativity in the early 20th century. For most applications, Keplerian motion approximates the motions of planets and satellites to relatively high degrees of accuracy and is used extensively in astronomy and astrodynamics.
Simplified two body problem
(See also Orbit Analysis)
To solve for the motion of an object in a two body system, two simplifying assumptions can be made:

1. The bodies are spherically symmetric and can be treated as point masses.
 
2. There are no external or internal forces acting upon the bodies other than their mutual gravitation.
 

The shapes of large celestial bodies are close to spheres. By symmetry, the net gravitational force attracting a mass point towards a homogeneous sphere must be directed towards its centre. The shell theorem (also proven by Isaac Newton) states that the magnitude of this force is the same as if all mass was concentrated in the middle of the sphere, even if the density of the sphere varies with depth (as it does for most celestial bodies). From this immediately follows that the attraction between two homogeneous spheres is as if both had its mass concentrated to its center.
Smaller objects, like asteroids or spacecraft often have a shape strongly deviating from a sphere. But the gravitational forces produced by these irregularities are generally small compared to the gravity of the central body. The difference between an irregular shape and a perfect sphere also diminishes with distances, and most orbital distances are very large when compared with the diameter of a small orbiting body. Thus for some applications, shape irregularity can be neglected without significant impact on accuracy.
Planets rotate at varying rates and thus may take a slightly oblate shape because of the centrifugal force. With such an oblate shape, the gravitational attraction will deviate somewhat from that of a homogeneous sphere. This phenomenon is quite noticeable for artificial Earth satellites, especially those in low orbits. At larger distances the effect of this oblateness becomes negligible. Planetary motions in the Solar System can be computed with sufficient precision if they are treated as point masses.
Two point mass objects with masses 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and position vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  relative to some inertial reference frame experience gravitational forces:






where 
 
 
 
  is the relative position vector of mass 1 with respect to mass 2, expressed as:



and 
 
 
 
  is the unit vector in that direction and 
 
 
 
  is the length of that vector.
Dividing by their respective masses and subtracting the second equation from the first yields the equation of motion for the acceleration of the first object with respect to the second:
= - \frac{\mu}{r^2} \mathbf{\hat{r}}|1}}
where 
 
 
 
  is the gravitational parameter and is equal to



In many applications, a third simplifying assumption can be made:

3. When compared to the central body, the mass of the orbiting body is insignificant. Mathematically, m1 >> m2, so μ = G (m1 + m2) ≈ Gm1.
 

This assumption is not necessary to solve the simplified two body problem, but it simplifies calculations, particularly with Earth-orbiting satellites and planets orbiting the sun. Even Jupiter's mass is less than the sun's by a factor of 1047,2 which would constitute an error of 0.096% in the value of μ. Notable exceptions include the Earth-moon system (mass ratio of 81.3), the Pluto-Charon system (mass ratio of 8.9) and binary star systems.
Under these assumptions the differential equation for the two body case can be completely solved mathematically and the resulting orbit which follows Kepler's laws of planetary motion is called a "Kepler orbit". The orbits of all planets are to high accuracy Kepler orbits around the Sun. The small deviations are due to the much weaker gravitational attractions between the planets, and in the case of Mercury, due to general relativity. The orbits of the artificial satellites around the Earth are, with a fair approximation, Kepler orbits with small perturbations due to the gravitational attraction of the sun, the moon and the oblateness of the Earth. In high accuracy applications for which the equation of motion must be integrated numerically with all gravitational and non-gravitational forces (such as solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag) being taken into account, the Kepler orbit concepts are of paramount importance and heavily used.
Keplerian elements
 
It is worth mentioning that any Keplerian trajectory can be defined by six parameters. The motion of an object moving in three-dimensional space is characterized by a position vector and a velocity vector. Each vector has three components, so the total number of values needed to define a trajectory through space is six. An orbit is generally defined by six elements (known as Keplerian elements) that can be computed from position and velocity, three of which have already been discussed. These elements are convenient in that of the six, five are unchanging for an unperturbed orbit (a stark contrast to two constantly changing vectors). The future location of an object within its orbit can be predicted and its new position and velocity can be easily obtained from the orbital elements.
Two define the size and shape of the trajectory:

Semimajor axis (
 
 
 
 )
Eccentricity (
 
 
 
 )

Three define the orientation of the orbital plane:

Inclination (
 
 
 
 ) defines the angle between the orbital plane and the reference plane.
Longitude of the ascending node (
 
 
 
 ) defines the angle between the reference direction and the upward crossing of the orbit on the reference plane (the ascending node).
Argument of periapsis (
 
 
 
 ) defines the angle between the ascending node and the periapsis.

And finally:

True anomaly (
 
 
 
 ) defines the position of the orbiting body along the trajectory, measured from periapsis. Several alternate values can be used instead of true anomaly, the most common being 
 
 
 
  the mean anomaly and 
 
 
 
 , the time since periapsis.

Because 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are simply angular measurements defining the orientation of the trajectory in the reference frame, they are not strictly necessary when discussing the motion of the object within the orbital plane. They have been mentioned here for completeness, but are not required for the proofs below.
Mathematical solution of the differential equation () above
For movement under any central force, i.e. a force parallel to r, the specific relative angular momentum

 
  stays constant:


  Since the cross product of the position vector and its velocity stays constant, they must lie in the same plane, orthogonal to 
 
 
 
 . This implies the vector function is a plane curve.
 Because the equation has symmetry around its origin, it is easier to solve in polar coordinates. However, it is important to note that equation () refers to linear acceleration 
 
 
 
 , as opposed to angular 
 
 
 
  or radial 
 
 
 
  acceleration. Therefore, one must be cautious when transforming the equation. Introducing a cartesian coordinate system 
 
 
 
  and polar unit vectors

 
  in the plane orthogonal to 
 
 
 
 :




  We can now rewrite the vector function 
 
 
 
  and its derivatives as:






  (see "Vector calculus"). Substituting these into (), we find:


  This gives the non-ordinary polar differential equation:


^2 = - \frac {\mu} {r^2}|2}}

In order to solve this equation, we must first eliminate all time derivatives. We find that:






Taking the time derivative of (), we get


{r^3}|4}}

Equations () and () allow us to eliminate the time derivatives of 
 
 
 
 . In order to eliminate the time derivatives of 
 
 
 
 , we must use the chain rule to find appropriate substitutions:





^2 + \frac {dr} {d\theta} \cdot \ddot {\theta}|6}}

Using these four substitutions, all time derivatives in () can be eliminated, yielding an ordinary differential equation for 
 
 
 
  as function of 
 
 
 
 .









The differential equation () can be solved analytically by the variable substitution



Using the chain rule for differentiation one gets:




Using the expressions () and () for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  one gets



with the general solution



where e and 
 
 
 
  are constants of integration depending on the initial values for s and 
 
 
 
 .
Instead of using the constant of integration 
 
 
 
  explicitly one introduces the convention that the unit vectors 
 
 
 
  defining the coordinate system in the orbital plane are selected such that 
 
 
 
  takes the value zero and e is positive. This then means that 
 
 
 
  is zero at the point where 
 
 
 
  is maximal and therefore 
 
 
 
  is minimal. Defining the parameter p as 
 
 
 
  one has that


Alternate derivation
Another way to solve this equation without the use of polar differential equations is as follows:
 Define a unit vector 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It follows that


  Now consider


  (see Vector triple product). Notice that




  Substituting these values into the previous equation, one gets:


  Integrating both sides:


  Where c is a constant vector. Dotting this with r yields an interesting result:


  Where 
 
 
 
  is the angle between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Solving for r:


  Notice that 
 
 
 
  are effectively the polar coordinates of the vector function. Making the substitutions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we again arrive at the equation



This is the equation in polar coordinates for a conic section with origin in a focal point. The argument 
 
 
 
  is called "true anomaly".

Properties of trajectory equation
For 
 
 
 
  this is a circle with radius p.
For 
 
 
 
  this is an ellipse with



= a \cdot \sqrt{1-e^2}|15}}

For 
 
 
 
  this is a parabola with focal length 
 
 

For 
 
 
 
  this is a hyperbola with



= a \cdot \sqrt{e^2-1}|17}}

The following image illustrates an ellipse (red), a parabola (green) and a hyperbola (blue)
(Figure)
An elliptic Kepler orbit with an eccentricity of 0.7, a parabolic Kepler orbit and a hyperbolic Kepler orbit with an eccentricity of 1.3. The distance to the focal point is a function of the polar angle relative to the horizontal line as given by the equation ()

The point on the horizontal line going out to the right from the focal point is the point with 
 
 
 
  for which the distance to the focus takes the minimal value 
 
 
 
 , the pericentre. For the ellipse there is also an apocentre for which the distance to the focus takes the maximal value 
 
 
 
 . For the hyperbola the range for 
 
 
 
  is


 
  and for a parabola the range is



Using the chain rule for differentiation (), the equation () and the definition of p as 
 
 
 
  one gets that the radial velocity component is


\cdot e \cdot \sin \theta|18}}

and that the tangential component (velocity component perpendicular to 
 
 
 
 ) is


\cdot (1 + e \cdot \cos \theta)|19}}

The connection between the polar argument 
 
 
 
  and time t is slightly different for elliptic and hyperbolic orbits.
For an elliptic orbit one switches to the "eccentric anomaly" E for which




and consequently




and the angular momentum H is



Integrating with respect to time t one gets



under the assumption that time 
 
 
 
  is selected such that the integration constant is zero.
As by definition of p one has



this can be written


( E - e \cdot \sin E)|27}}

For a hyperbolic orbit one uses the hyperbolic functions for the parameterisation




for which one has




and the angular momentum H is



Integrating with respect to time t one gets



i.e.


(e \cdot \sinh E-E)|34}}

To find what time t that corresponds to a certain true anomaly 
 
 
 
  one computes corresponding parameter E connected to time with relation () for an elliptic and with relation () for a hyperbolic orbit.
Note that the relations () and () define a mapping between the ranges



Some additional formulae
See also Equation of the center – Analytical expansions
For an elliptic orbit one gets from () and () that



and therefore that



From () then follows that



From the geometrical construction defining the eccentric anomaly it is clear that the vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are on the same side of the x-axis. From this then follows that the vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are in the same quadrant. One therefore has that


\cdot \tan \frac{E}{2}|37}}

and that




where "
 
 
 
 " is the polar argument of the vector 
 
 
 
  and n is selected such that 
 
 

For the numerical computation of 
 
 
 
  the standard function ATAN2(y,x) (or in double precision DATAN2(y,x)) available in for example the programming language FORTRAN can be used.
Note that this is a mapping between the ranges



For an hyperbolic orbit one gets from () and () that



and therefore that



As


 
  and as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have the same sign it follows that


\cdot \tanh \frac{E}{2}|42}}

This relation is convenient for passing between "true anomaly" and the parameter E, the latter being connected to time through relation (). Note that this is a mapping between the ranges



and that 
 
 
 
  can be computed using the relation



From relation () follows that the orbital period P for an elliptic orbit is


|43}}

As the potential energy corresponding to the force field of relation () is


 
  it follows from (), (), () and () that the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy



for an elliptic orbit is



and from (), (), () and () that the sum of the kinetic and the potential energy for a hyperbolic orbit is



Relative the inertial coordinate system



in the orbital plane with 
 
 
 
  towards pericentre one gets from () and () that the velocity components are

\cdot (e +\cos \theta)|47}}

Determination of the Kepler orbit that corresponds to a given initial state
This is the "initial value problem" for the differential equation () which is a first order equation for the 6-dimensional "state vector" 
 
 
 
  when written as


= -\mu \cdot \frac {\hat{r}} {r^2}|48}}

= \bar{v}|49}}

For any values for the initial "state vector" 
 
 
 
  the Kepler orbit corresponding to the solution of this initial value problem can be found with the following algorithm:
Define the orthogonal unit vectors 
 
 
 
  through




with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

From (), () and () follows that by setting



and by defining 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that




where


|55}}

one gets a Kepler orbit that for true anomaly 
 
 
 
  has the same r, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  values as those defined by () and ().
If this Kepler orbit then also has the same 
 
 
 
  vectors for this true anomaly 
 
 
 
  as the ones defined by () and () the state vector 
 
 
 
  of the Kepler orbit takes the desired values 
 
 
 
  for true anomaly 
 
 
 
 .
The standard inertially fixed coordinate system 
 
 
 
  in the orbital plane (with 
 
 
 
  directed from the centre of the homogeneous sphere to the pericentre) defining the orientation of the conical section (ellipse, parabola or hyperbola) can then be determined with the relation




Note that the relations () and () has a singularity when 
 
 
 
  and



i.e.

which is the case that it is a circular orbit that is fitting the initial state 
 
 

The osculating Kepler orbit
For any state vector 
 
 
 
  the Kepler orbit corresponding to this state can be computed with the algorithm defined above. First the parameters 
 
 
 
  are determined from 
 
 
 
  and then the orthogonal unit vectors in the orbital plane 
 
 
 
  using the relations () and ().
If now the equation of motion is


= \operatorname{\bar{F}}(\bar{r},\dot {\bar{r}},t)|59}}

where



is a function other than



the resulting parameters



defined by 
 
 
 
  will all vary with time as opposed to the case of a Kepler orbit for which only the parameter 
 
 
 
  will vary
The Kepler orbit computed in this way having the same "state vector" as the solution to the "equation of motion" () at time t is said to be "osculating" at this time.
This concept is for example useful in case



where



is a small "perturbing force" due to for example a faint gravitational pull from other celestial bodies. The parameters of the osculating Kepler orbit will then only slowly change and the osculating Kepler orbit is a good approximation to the real orbit for a considerable time period before and after the time of osculation.
This concept can also be useful for a rocket during powered flight as it then tells which Kepler orbit the rocket would continue in in case the thrust is switched off.
For a "close to circular" orbit the concept "eccentricity vector" defined as 
 
 
 
  is useful. From (), () and () follows that


{V_0}|60}}

i.e.
