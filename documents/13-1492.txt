   Gewirtz graph      Gewirtz graph   The Gewirtz graph is a strongly regular graph with 56 vertices and valency 10. It is named after the mathematician Allan Gewirtz, who described the graph in his dissertation. 1  Construction  The Gewirtz graph can be constructed as follows. Consider the unique S (3, 6, 22) Steiner system , with 22 elements and 77 blocks. Choose a random element, and let the vertices be the 56 blocks not containing it. Two blocks are adjacent when they are disjoint.  With this construction, one can embed the Gewirtz graph in the Higman–Sims graph .  Properties  The characteristic polynomial of the Gewirtz graph is        (   x  -  10   )     (   x  -  2   )   35     (   x  +  4   )   20    .        x  10    superscript    x  2   35    superscript    x  4   20     (x-10)(x-2)^{35}(x+4)^{20}.\,     Therefore it is an integral graph . The Gewirtz graph is also determined by its spectrum.  The independence number is 16.
