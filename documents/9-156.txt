Safety data
Material Safety Data Sheet for benzene:




Common synonyms

None



Physical properties

Form: colorless liquid




Stability: Stable, but very flammable




Melting point: 5.5 C




Water solubility: negligible




Specific gravity: 0.87



Principal hazards


Benzene is a carcinogen (cancer-causing agent).







Very flammable. The pure material, and any solutions containing it, constitute a fire risk.





Safe handling

Benzene should NOT be used at all unless no safer alternatives are available.




If benzene must be used in an experiment, it should be handled at all stages in a fume cupboard.




Wear safety glasses and use protective gloves.



Emergency

Eye contact: Immediately flush the eye with plenty of water. Continue for at least ten minutes




and call for immediate medical help.




Skin contact: Wash off with soap and water. Remove any contaminated clothing. If the skin




reddens or appears damaged, call for medical aid.




If swallowed: Call for immediate medical help.



Disposal

It is dangerous to try to dispose of benzene by washing it down a sink, since it is toxic, will cause environmental damage




and presents a fire risk. It is probable that trying to dispose of benzene in this way will also break local




environmental rules. Instead, retain in a safe place in the laboratory (well away from any source of ignition)




for disposal with other flammable, non-chlorinated solvents.



Protective equipment

Safety glasses. If gloves are worn, PVA, butyl rubber and viton are suitable materials.
