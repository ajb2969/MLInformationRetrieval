   Guanosine phosphorylase      Guanosine phosphorylase   In enzymology , a guanosine phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   guanosine + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   guanine + alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are guanosine and phosphate , whereas its two products are guanine and alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is guanosine:phosphate alpha-D-ribosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
