   Skew flip turnover      Skew flip turnover   A skew flip turnover is a maneuver in which an aircraft or spacecraft accelerates to a certain point, flips over (skew flip) and begins to accelerate in the opposite direction. Weaker spacecraft will accelerate up to a certain velocity , coast for a while, then decelerate to rest .  If the desired acceleration of the spacecraft is known (generally one g or 9.81 m/s²) and the transit time is to be calculated, the equation is      T  =   2    D  A         T    2      D  A       T=2\sqrt{D\over A}     where   T = time (seconds)  D = distance (m)  A = acceleration (m/s2)  1 g = 9.81 m/s²   The skew flip turnover was described in Robert A. Heinlein 's book Have Space Suit—Will Travel .  See also   Brachistochrone   Resources   http://www.projectrho.com/rocket/rocket3i.html   "  Category:Orbital maneuvers  Category:Aerial maneuvers
