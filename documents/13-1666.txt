   Conductor (class field theory)      Conductor (class field theory)   In algebraic number theory , the conductor of a finite  abelian extension of local or global fields provides a quantitative measure of the ramification in the extension. The definition of the conductor is related to the Artin map .  Local conductor  Let L / K be a finite abelian extension of non-archimedean local fields . The conductor of L / K , denoted    𝔣   (   L  /  K   )       𝔣    L  K     \mathfrak{f}(L/K)   , is the smallest non-negative integer  n such that the higher unit group       U   (  n  )    =   1  +   𝔪  n    =   {   u  ∈   𝒪  ×    :   u  ≡    1    (    mod    𝔪  K  n    )     }          superscript  U  n     1   superscript  𝔪  n          conditional-set    u   superscript  𝒪       u    1    mod   superscript   subscript  𝔪  K   n          U^{(n)}=1+\mathfrak{m}^{n}=\left\{u\in\mathcal{O}^{\times}:u\equiv 1\,(\mathrm%
 {mod}\,\mathfrak{m}_{K}^{n})\right\}   is contained in N L / K ( L × ), where ''N L / K'' is field norm map and    𝔪  K     subscript  𝔪  K    \mathfrak{m}_{K}   is the maximal ideal of K . 1 Equivalently, n is the smallest integer such that the local Artin map is trivial on    U  K   (  n  )      superscript   subscript  U  K   n    U_{K}^{(n)}   . Sometimes, the conductor is defined as    𝔪  K  n     superscript   subscript  𝔪  K   n    \mathfrak{m}_{K}^{n}   where n is as above. 2  The conductor of an extension measures the ramification. Qualitatively, the extension is unramified if, and only if, the conductor is zero, 3 and it is tamely ramified if, and only if, the conductor is 1. 4 More precisely, the conductor computes the non-triviality of higher ramification groups : if s is the largest integer for which the " lower numbering " higher ramification group G s is non-trivial, then     𝔣   (   L  /  K   )    =     η   L  /  K     (  s  )    +  1         𝔣    L  K         subscript  η    L  K    s   1     \mathfrak{f}(L/K)=\eta_{L/K}(s)+1   , where η L / K is the function that translates from "lower numbering" to " upper numbering " of higher ramification groups. 5  The conductor of L / K is also related to the Artin conductors of characters of the Galois group Gal( L / K ). Specifically, 6       𝔪  K   𝔣   (   L  /  K   )     =     lcm  𝜒     𝔪  K   𝔣  χ          superscript   subscript  𝔪  K     𝔣    L  K        χ  lcm    superscript   subscript  𝔪  K    subscript  𝔣  χ       \mathfrak{m}_{K}^{\mathfrak{f}(L/K)}=\underset{\chi}{\mathrm{lcm}}\,\mathfrak{%
 m}_{K}^{\mathfrak{f}_{\chi}}   where χ varies over all multiplicative complex characters of Gal( L / K ),    𝔣  χ     subscript  𝔣  χ    \mathfrak{f}_{\chi}   is the Artin conductor of χ, and lcm is the least common multiple .  More general fields  The conductor can be defined in the same way for L / K a not necessarily abelian finite Galois extension of local fields. 7 However, it only depends on L ab / K , the maximal abelian extension of K in L , because of the "norm limitation theorem", which states that, in this situation, 8 9         N   L  /  K     (   L  ×   )    =    N    L  ab   /  K     (    (   L  ab   )   ×   )     .         subscript  N    L  K     superscript  L        subscript  N     superscript  L  ab   K     superscript   superscript  L  ab        N_{L/K}(L^{\times})=N_{L^{\text{ab}}/K}\left((L^{\text{ab}})^{\times}\right).     Additionally, the conductor can be defined when L and K are allowed to be slightly more general than local, namely if they are complete valued fields with quasi-finite residue field. 10  Archimedean fields  Mostly for the sake of global conductors, the conductor of the trivial extension R / R is defined to be 0, and the conductor of the extension C / R is defined to be 1. 11  Global conductor  Algebraic number fields  The conductor of an abelian extension L / K of number fields can be defined, similarly to the local case, using the Artin map. Specifically, let θ : I m → Gal( L / K ) be the global Artin map where the modulus  m is a defining modulus for L / K ; we say that Artin reciprocity holds for m if θ factors through the ray class group modulo  m . We define the conductor of L / K , denoted    𝔣   (   L  /  K   )       𝔣    L  K     \mathfrak{f}(L/K)   , to be the highest common factor of all moduli for which reciprocity holds; in fact reciprocity holds for    𝔣   (   L  /  K   )       𝔣    L  K     \mathfrak{f}(L/K)   , so it is the smallest such modulus. 12 13 14  Example   Taking as base the field of rational numbers, the Kronecker–Weber theorem states that an algebraic number field K is abelian over Q if and only if it is a subfield of a cyclotomic field     𝐐   (   ζ  n   )       𝐐   subscript  ζ  n     \mathbf{Q}(\zeta_{n})   . 15 The conductor of K is then the smallest such n .  Let L / K be     𝐐   (   d   )    /  𝐐        𝐐    d    𝐐    \mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})/\mathbf{Q}   where d is a squarefree integer. Then, 16     \mathfrak{f}\left(\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})/\mathbf{Q}\right) = \begin{cases}     \left|\Delta_{\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})}\right| & \text{for }d>0 \\ \infty\left|\Delta_{\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})}\right| & \text{for }d   where    Δ   𝐐   (   d   )       subscript  normal-Δ    𝐐    d      \Delta_{\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})}   is the discriminant of     𝐐   (   d   )    /  𝐐        𝐐    d    𝐐    \mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})/\mathbf{Q}   .   Relation to local conductors and ramification  The global conductor is the product of local conductors: 17        𝔣   (   L  /  K   )    =    ∏  𝔭    𝔭   𝔣   (    L  𝔭   /   K  𝔭    )       .        𝔣    L  K      subscript  product  𝔭    superscript  𝔭    𝔣     subscript  L  𝔭    subscript  K  𝔭         \displaystyle\mathfrak{f}(L/K)=\prod_{\mathfrak{p}}\mathfrak{p}^{\mathfrak{f}(%
 L_{\mathfrak{p}}/K_{\mathfrak{p}})}.   As a consequence, a finite prime is ramified in L / K if, and only if, it divides    𝔣   (   L  /  K   )       𝔣    L  K     \mathfrak{f}(L/K)   . 18 An infinite prime v occurs in the conductor if, and only if, v is real and becomes complex in L .
