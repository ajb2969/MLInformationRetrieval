Irrationality sequence

In mathematics, a sequence of positive integers an is called an irrationality sequence if it has the property that, for every sequence xn of positive integers, the sum of the series



exists (that is, it converges) and is an irrational number.12 The problem of characterizing irrationality sequences was posed by Paul Erd≈ës and Ernst G. Straus, who originally called the property of being an irrationality sequence "Property P".3
Examples
The powers of two whose exponents are powers of two, 
 
 
 
 , form an irrationality sequence. However, although Sylvester's sequence

2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3263443, ...
 

(in which each term is one more than the product of all previous terms) also grows doubly exponentially, it does not form an irrationality sequence. For, letting 
 
 
 
  gives


 
  a series converging to a rational number. Likewise, the factorials

 
  do not form an irrationality sequence, because the sequence 
 
 
 
  leads to a series with a rational sum,

Growth rate
Any sequence an that grows at a rate such that


 
  is an irrationality sequence. This includes sequences that grow at a more than doubly exponential rate as well as some doubly exponential sequences that grow more quickly than the powers of powers of two.5
Every irrationality sequence must grow quickly enough that


 
  However, it is not known whether there exists such a sequence in which the greatest common divisor of each pair of terms is 1 (unlike the powers of powers of two) and for which
