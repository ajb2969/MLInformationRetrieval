   Irrationality sequence      Irrationality sequence   In mathematics, a sequence of positive integers  a n is called an irrationality sequence if it has the property that, for every sequence x n of positive integers, the sum of the series       ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1    a  n    x  n         superscript   subscript     n  1        1     subscript  a  n    subscript  x  n       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{a_{n}x_{n}}     exists (that is, it converges ) and is an irrational number . 1 2 The problem of characterizing irrationality sequences was posed by Paul Erdős and Ernst G. Straus , who originally called the property of being an irrationality sequence "Property P". 3  Examples  The powers of two whose exponents are powers of two ,    2   2  n      superscript  2   superscript  2  n     2^{2^{n}}   , form an irrationality sequence. However, although Sylvester's sequence   2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3263443, ...   (in which each term is one more than the product of all previous terms) also grows doubly exponentially , it does not form an irrationality sequence. For, letting     x  n   =  1       subscript  x  n   1    x_{n}=1   gives         1  2   +   1  3   +   1  7   +   1  43   +  ⋯   =  1   ,          1  2     1  3     1  7     1  43   normal-⋯   1    \frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{43}+\cdots=1,   a series converging to a rational number. Likewise, the factorials     n  !      n    n!   do not form an irrationality sequence, because the sequence     x  n   =   n  +  2        subscript  x  n     n  2     x_{n}=n+2   leads to a series with a rational sum,        ∑   n  =  0   ∞    1    (   n  +  2   )    n  !      =    1  2   +   1  3   +   1  8   +   1  30   +   1  144   +  ⋯   =  1.          superscript   subscript     n  0        1      n  2     n          1  2     1  3     1  8     1  30     1  144   normal-⋯        1.     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{(n+2)n!}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{8}+\frac%
 {1}{30}+\frac{1}{144}+\cdots=1.    4  Growth rate  Any sequence a n that grows at a rate such that        lim sup  n     log   log   a  n     n    >   log  2         subscript  limit-supremum  n          subscript  a  n     n      2     \limsup_{n}\frac{\log\log a_{n}}{n}>\log 2   is an irrationality sequence. This includes sequences that grow at a more than doubly exponential rate as well as some doubly exponential sequences that grow more quickly than the powers of powers of two. 5  Every irrationality sequence must grow quickly enough that         lim   n  →  ∞     a  n   1  /  n     =  ∞   .        subscript    normal-→  n      superscript   subscript  a  n     1  n        \lim_{n\to\infty}a_{n}^{1/n}=\infty.   However, it is not known whether there exists such a sequence in which the greatest common divisor of each pair of terms is 1 (unlike the powers of powers of two) and for which         lim   n  →  ∞     a  n   1  /   2  n      <  ∞   .        subscript    normal-→  n      superscript   subscript  a  n     1   superscript  2  n         \lim_{n\to\infty}a_{n}^{1/2^{n}}<\infty.    6  Related properties  Analogously to irrationality sequences,  has defined a transcendental sequence to be an integer sequence a n such that, for every sequence x n of positive integers, the sum of the series       ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1    a  n    x  n         superscript   subscript     n  1        1     subscript  a  n    subscript  x  n       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{a_{n}x_{n}}   exists and is an transcendental number . 7  References  "  Category:Integer sequences  Category:Irrational numbers  Category:Number theory     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩    . ↩  . ↩
