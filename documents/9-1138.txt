Preimage theorem

In mathematics, particularly in differential topology, the preimage theorem is a variation of the implicit function theorem concerning the preimage of particular points in a manifold under the action of a smooth map.12
Statement of Theorem
Definition. Let 
 
 
 
  be a smooth map between manifolds. We say that a point 
 
 
 
  is a regular value of f if for all 
 
 
 
  the map 
 
 
 
 
  is surjective. Here, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the tangent spaces of X and Y at the points x and y.
Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  be a smooth map, and let 
 
 
 
  be a regular value of f; then 
 
 
 
 
  is a submanifold of X. If 
 
 
 
 , then the codimension of 
 
 
 
  is equal to the dimension of Y. Also, the tangent space of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is equal to
