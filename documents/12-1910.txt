   Lumpability      Lumpability   In probability theory , lumpability is a method for reducing the size of the state space of some continuous-time Markov chains , first published by Kemeny and Snell. 1  Definition  Suppose that the complete state-space of a Markov chain is divided into disjoint subsets of states, where these subsets are denoted by t i . This forms a partition     T  =   {   t  1   ,   t  2   ,  …  }       T    subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2   normal-…     \scriptstyle{T=\{t_{1},t_{2},\ldots\}}   of the states. Both the state-space and the collection of subsets may be either finite or countably infinite. A continuous-time Markov chain    {   X  i   }      subscript  X  i     \{X_{i}\}   is lumpable with respect to the partition T if and only if, for any subsets t i and t j in the partition, and for any states n,n’ in subset t i ,         ∑   m  ∈   t  j      q   (  n  ,  m  )     =    ∑   m  ∈   t  j      q   (   n  ′   ,  m  )      ,        subscript     m   subscript  t  j       q   n  m       subscript     m   subscript  t  j       q    superscript  n  normal-′   m       \sum_{m\in t_{j}}q(n,m)=\sum_{m\in t_{j}}q(n^{\prime},m),     where q ( i,j ) is the transition rate from state i to state j . 2  Similarly, for a stochastic matrix  P , P is a lumpable matrix on a partition T if and only if, for any subsets t i and t j in the partition, and for any states n,n’ in subset t i ,         ∑   m  ∈   t  j      p   (  n  ,  m  )     =    ∑   m  ∈   t  j      p   (   n  ′   ,  m  )      ,        subscript     m   subscript  t  j       p   n  m       subscript     m   subscript  t  j       p    superscript  n  normal-′   m       \sum_{m\in t_{j}}p(n,m)=\sum_{m\in t_{j}}p(n^{\prime},m),     where p ( i,j ) is the probability of moving from state i to state j . 3  Example  Consider the matrix      P  =   (       1  2        3  8        1  16        1  16          7  16        7  16      0      1  8          1  16      0      1  2        7  16        0      1  16        3  8        9  16       )       P      1  2     3  8     1  16     1  16       7  16     7  16   0    1  8       1  16   0    1  2     7  16     0    1  16     3  8     9  16       P=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{1}{2}&\frac{3}{8}&\frac{1}{16}&\frac{1}{16}\\
 \frac{7}{16}&\frac{7}{16}&0&\frac{1}{8}\\
 \frac{1}{16}&0&\frac{1}{2}&\frac{7}{16}\\
 0&\frac{1}{16}&\frac{3}{8}&\frac{9}{16}\end{pmatrix}     and notice it is lumpable on the partition t = {(1,2),(3,4)} so we write       P  t   =   (       7  8        1  8          1  16        15  16       )        subscript  P  t       7  8     1  8       1  16     15  16       P_{t}=\begin{pmatrix}\frac{7}{8}&\frac{1}{8}\\
 \frac{1}{16}&\frac{15}{16}\end{pmatrix}     and call P t the lumped matrix of P on t .  Successively lumpable processes  In 2012, Katehakis and Smit discovered the Successively Lumpable processes for which the stationary probabilities can be obtained by successively computing the stationary probabilities of a propitiously constructed sequence of Markov chains. Each of the latter chains has a (typically much) smaller state space and this yields significant computational improvements. These results have many applications reliability and queueing models and problems. 4  Quasi–lumpability  Franceschinis and Muntz introduced quasi-lumpability, a property whereby a small change in the rate matrix makes the chain lumpable. 5  See also   Nearly completely decomposable Markov chain   References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  Jane Hillston , Compositional Markovian Modelling Using A Process Algebra in the Proceedings of the Second International Workshop on Numerical Solution of Markov Chains: Computations with Markov Chains, Raleigh, North Carolina, January 1995.
