Lumpability

In probability theory, lumpability is a method for reducing the size of the state space of some continuous-time Markov chains, first published by Kemeny and Snell.1
Definition
Suppose that the complete state-space of a Markov chain is divided into disjoint subsets of states, where these subsets are denoted by ti. This forms a partition

 
  of the states. Both the state-space and the collection of subsets may be either finite or countably infinite. A continuous-time Markov chain 
 
 
 
  is lumpable with respect to the partition T if and only if, for any subsets ti and tj in the partition, and for any states n,n’ in subset ti,



where q(i,j) is the transition rate from state i to state j.2
Similarly, for a stochastic matrix P, P is a lumpable matrix on a partition T if and only if, for any subsets ti and tj in the partition, and for any states n,n’ in subset ti,



where p(i,j) is the probability of moving from state i to state j.3
Example
Consider the matrix



and notice it is lumpable on the partition t = {(1,2),(3,4)} so we write



and call Pt the lumped matrix of P on t.
Successively lumpable processes
In 2012, Katehakis and Smit discovered the Successively Lumpable processes for which the stationary probabilities can be obtained by successively computing the stationary probabilities of a propitiously constructed sequence of Markov chains. Each of the latter chains has a (typically much) smaller state space and this yields significant computational improvements. These results have many applications reliability and queueing models and problems.4
Quasi–lumpability
Franceschinis and Muntz introduced quasi-lumpability, a property whereby a small change in the rate matrix makes the chain lumpable.5
