Confluent hypergeometric function

In mathematics, a confluent hypergeometric function is a solution of a confluent hypergeometric equation, which is a degenerate form of a hypergeometric differential equation where two of the three regular singularities merge into an irregular singularity. (The term "confluent" refers to the merging of singular points of families of differential equations; "confluere" is Latin for "to flow together".) There are several common standard forms of confluent hypergeometric functions:

Kummer's (confluent hypergeometric) function

 
 , introduced by , is a solution to Kummer's differential equation. There is a different and unrelated Kummer's function bearing the same name.
Tricomi's (confluent hypergeometric) function

 
  introduced by , sometimes denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is another solution to Kummer's equation.
Whittaker functions (for Edmund Taylor Whittaker) are solutions to Whittaker's equation.
Coulomb wave functions are solutions to the Coulomb wave equation. The Kummer functions, Whittaker functions, and Coulomb wave functions are essentially the same, and differ from each other only by elementary functions and change of variables.

Kummer's equation
Kummer's equation may be written as:



with a regular singular point at 
 
 
 
  and an irregular singular point at 
 
 
 
 . It has two (usually) linearly independent solutions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Kummer's function (of the first kind) M is a generalized hypergeometric series introduced in , given by:



where:






is the rising factorial. Another common notation for this solution is 
 
 
 
 . Considered as a function of a, b, or 
 
 
 
  with the other two held constant, this defines an entire function of a or z, except when 
 
 
 
  As a function of 
 
 
 
  it is analytic except for poles at the non-positive integers.
Some values of a and 
 
 
 
  yield solutions that can be expressed in terms of other known functions. See #Special cases. When a is a non-positive integer then Kummer's function (if it is defined) is a (generalized) Laguerre polynomial.
Just as the confluent differential equation is a limit of the hypergeometric differential equation as the singular point at 1 is moved towards the singular point at ∞, the confluent hypergeometric function can be given as a limit of the hypergeometric function



and many of the properties of the confluent hypergeometric function are limiting cases of properties of the hypergeometric function.
Since Kummer's equation is second order there must be another, independent, solution. For this we can usually use the Tricomi confluent hypergeometric function 
 
 
 
  introduced by , and sometimes denoted by 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
  is defined in terms of Kummer's function M by



This is undefined for integer 
 
 
 
 , but can be extended to integer 
 
 
 
  by continuity. Unlike Kummer's function which is an entire function of z, U(z) usually has a singularity at zero. But see #Special cases for some examples where it is an entire function (polynomial).
Note that if



which can occur if 
 
 
 
  is a non-positive integer, then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are not independent and another solution is needed. Also when 
 
 
 
  is a non-positive integer we need another solution because then 
 
 
 
  is not defined. For instance, if 
 
 
 
 , Kummer's function is undefined, but two independent solutions are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  For a = 0 but at other values of b, we have the two solutions:






When b = 1 this second solution is the exponential integral Ei(z).
See #Special cases for solutions to some other cases.
Other equations
Confluent Hypergeometric Functions can be used to solve the Extended Confluent Hypergeometric Equation whose general form is given as:


1
{NB that for M=0 (or when the summation involves just one term), it reduces to the conventional Confluent Hypergeometric Equation}
Thus Confluent Hypergeometric Functions can be used to solve "most" second-order ordinary differential equations whose variable coefficients are all linear functions of 
 
 
 
 ; because they can be transformed to the Extended Confluent Hypergeometric Equation. Consider the equation:



First we move the regular singular point to 
 
 
 
  by using the substitution of 
 
 
 
  which converts the equation to:



with new values of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Next we use the substitution:



and multiply the equation by the same factor, we get:



whose solution is



where 
 
 
 
  is a solution to Kummer's equation with



Note that the square root may give an imaginary (or complex) number. If it is zero, another solution must be used, namely



where 
 
 
 
  is a confluent hypergeometric limit function satisfying



As noted lower down, even the Bessel equation can be solved using confluent hypergeometric functions.
Integral representations
If Re b > Re a > 0, 
 
 
 
  can be represented as an integral



thus 
 
 
 
  is the characteristic function of the beta distribution. For a with positive real part 
 
 
 
  can be obtained by the Laplace integral



The integral defines a solution in the right half-plane 
 
 
 
 .
They can also be represented as Barnes integrals



where the contour passes to one side of the poles of 
 
 
 
  and to the other side of the poles of 
 
 
 
 .
Asymptotic behavior
If a solution to Kummer's equation is asymptotic to a power of 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , then the power must be 
 
 
 
 . This is in fact the case for Tricomi's solution 
 
 
 
 . Its asymptotic behavior as 
 
 
 
  can be deduced from the integral representations. If 
 
 
 
 , then making a change of variables in the integral followed by expanding the binomial series and integrating it formally term by term gives rise to an asymptotic series expansion, valid as 
 
 
 
 :2



where 
 
 
 
  is a generalized hypergeometric series (with 1 as leading term), which generally converges nowhere but exists as a formal power series in 1/x. This asymptotic expansion is also valid for complex 
 
 
 
  instead of real x, with 
 
 

The asymptotic behavior of Kummer's solution for large |z| is:



The powers of 
 
 
 
  are taken using 
 
 
 
 .3 The first term is only needed when 
 
 
 
  is infinite (that is, when 
 
 
 
  is a non-positive integer) or when the real part of 
 
 
 
  is non-negative, whereas the second term is only needed when 
 
 
 
  is infinite (that is, when a is a non-positive integer) or when the real part of 
 
 
 
  is non-positive.
There is always some solution to Kummer's equation asymptotic to 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . Usually this will be a combination of both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  but can also be expressed as 
 
 
 
 .
Relations
There are many relations between Kummer functions for various arguments and their derivatives. This section gives a few typical examples.
Contiguous relations
Given 
 
 
 
 , the four functions 
 
 
 
  are called contiguous to 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
  can be written as a linear combination of any two of its contiguous functions, with rational coefficients in terms of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . This gives ()=6 relations, given by identifying any two lines on the right hand side of



In the notation above, M = M(a, b, z), M(a+) = M(a + 1, b, z), and so on.
Repeatedly applying these relations gives a linear relation between any three functions of the form 
 
 
 
  (and their higher derivatives), where m, n are integers.
There are similar relations for U.
Kummer's transformation
Kummer's functions are also related by Kummer's transformations:





 
 .
Multiplication theorem
The following multiplication theorems hold true:



Connection with Laguerre polynomials and similar representations
In terms of Laguerre polynomials, Kummer's functions have several expansions, for example



Special cases
Functions that can be expressed as special cases of the confluent hypergeometric function include:

Some elementary functions (the left-hand side is not defined when 
 
 
 
  is a non-positive integer, but the right-hand side is still a solution of the corresponding Kummer equation):














 
  (a polynomial if a is a non-positive integer)
 








 
  for integer n is a Bessel polynomial (see lower down).
 


 
  for non-positive integer n is a generalized Laguerre polynomial.
 




Bateman's function
Bessel functions and many related functions such as Airy functions, Kelvin functions, Hankel functions. For example, the special case 
 
 
 
  the function reduces to a Bessel function:








This identity is sometimes also referred to as Kummer's second transformation. Similarly
 
 



When 
 
 
 
  is a non-positive integer, this equals 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a Bessel polynomial.
 


The error function can be expressed as










Coulomb wave function
Cunningham functions
Exponential integral and related functions such as the sine integral, logarithmic integral
Hermite polynomials
Incomplete gamma function
Laguerre polynomials
Parabolic cylinder function (or Weber function)
Poisson–Charlier function
Toronto functions
Whittaker functions  are solutions of Whittaker's equation that can be expressed in terms of Kummer functions M and U by













The general 
 
 
 
 -th raw moment (
 
 
 
  not necessarily an integer) can be expressed as







\operatorname{E} \left[\left|N\left(\mu, \sigma^2 \right)\right|^p \right] &= \frac{\left(2 \sigma^2\right)^{\frac{p}{2}} \Gamma\left(\tfrac{1+p}{2}\right)}{\sqrt \pi} \ {}_1F_1\left(-\tfrac p 2, \tfrac 1 2, -\tfrac{\mu^2}{2 \sigma^2}\right)\\ \operatorname{E} \left[N \left(\mu, \sigma^2 \right)^p \right] &= \left (-2 \sigma^2\right)^\frac p 2 U\left(-\tfrac p 2, \tfrac 1 2, -\tfrac{\mu^2}{2 \sigma^2} \right) \end{align}

In the second formula the function's second branch cut can be chosen by multiplying with 
 
 
 
 .
 

Application to continued fractions
By applying a limiting argument to Gauss's continued fraction it can be shown that



and that this continued fraction converges uniformly to a meromorphic function of 
 
 
 
  in every bounded domain that does not include a pole.

This is derived from Abramowitz and Stegun (see reference below), page 508. They give a full asymptotic series. They switch the sign of the exponent in exp(iπa) in the right half-plane but this is unimportant because the term is negligible there or else a is an integer and the sign doesn't matter.↩
