Homological integration

In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and geometric measure theory, homological integration or geometric integration is a method for extending the notion of the integral to manifolds. Rather than functions or differential forms, the integral is defined over currents on a manifold.
The theory is "homological" because currents themselves are defined by duality with differential forms. To wit, the space Dk of k-currents on a manifold M is defined as the dual space, in the sense of distributions, of the space of k-forms Ωk on M. Thus there is a pairing between k-currents T and k-forms α, denoted here by


 
  Under this duality pairing, the exterior derivative


 
  goes over to a boundary operator


 
  defined by


 
  for all α ∈ Ωk. This is a homological rather than cohomological construction.
