   Homological integration      Homological integration   In the mathematical fields of differential geometry and geometric measure theory , homological integration or geometric integration is a method for extending the notion of the integral to manifolds . Rather than functions or differential forms , the integral is defined over currents on a manifold.  The theory is "homological" because currents themselves are defined by duality with differential forms. To wit, the space D k of k -currents on a manifold M is defined as the dual space , in the sense of distributions , of the space of k -forms Ω k on M . Thus there is a pairing between k -currents T and k -forms α, denoted here by       ⟨  T  ,  α  ⟩   .     T  α    \langle T,\alpha\rangle.   Under this duality pairing, the exterior derivative      d  :    Ω   k  -  1    →   Ω  k       normal-:  d   normal-→   superscript  normal-Ω    k  1     superscript  normal-Ω  k      d:\Omega^{k-1}\to\Omega^{k}   goes over to a boundary operator      ∂  :    D  k   →   D   k  -  1        normal-:    normal-→   superscript  D  k    superscript  D    k  1       \partial:D^{k}\to D^{k-1}   defined by       ⟨   ∂  T   ,  α  ⟩   =   ⟨  T  ,   d  α   ⟩          T   α    T    d  α      \langle\partial T,\alpha\rangle=\langle T,d\alpha\rangle   for all α ∈ Ω k . This is a homological rather than cohomological construction.  References     .   "  Category:Definitions of mathematical integration  Category:Measure theory
