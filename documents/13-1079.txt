Delivery Performance

Delivery Performance (DP) is a broadly used standard KPI measurement in supply chains to measure the fulfillment of a customers demand to the wish date. Following the nomenclature of the DR-DP-Matrix three main approaches to measure DR can be distinguished:












Type of measurement: volume (V)/singular(S)
 
Type of view: on time (T)/ delivery (D)
 

Volume/On Time
Formula
If (

  = 
 
 
 
  Else

NULL
 

Demand:= customers wish c:= product identifier p:= Time period e.g. a day, a week, a month ...
The cumulation over a period and a group of product identifiers c is done as follows: 
 
 

whereas p is determined by demand period
Singular/Delivery and Singular/On Time
Singular case definition
To fit to the needs of the environment, the granularity of a singular case (
 
 
 
 ) has to be defined. In general a singular case is described by a n-Tuple consisting of a set of the following order and delivery details:

order number
customer identifier
product identifier
wish date of customer
confirmed date of supplier
ship to information
delivery date
delivery note number

Formula






After a singular case has been delivered to the customer its DP is measured as follows:
 
If (wish date = arrival date) then
 
DPsingular case=1
 


else
 
DPsingular case=0
 





arrival date = delivery date + transit time
By cumulating the results of singular cases over a certain period p and, if necessary, additional criteria c (e.g. customer, product, ...) the delivery performance is calculated as follows:



whereas p is determined by the arrival date






After a period has elapsed all singular cases with wish date within period are considered and their DP is measured as follows:
 
If (wish date = arrival date) then
 
DRsingular case=1
 


else
 
DRsingular case=0
 





arrival date = delivery date + transit time
By cumulating the results of singular cases over a certain period p and, if necessary, additional criteria c (e.g. customer, product, ...) the delivery performance is calculated as follows:



whereas p is determined by the first confirmed date
