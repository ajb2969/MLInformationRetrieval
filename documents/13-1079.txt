   Delivery Performance      Delivery Performance   Delivery Performance (DP) is a broadly used standard KPI measurement in supply chains to measure the fulfillment of a customers demand to the wish date. Following the nomenclature of the DR-DP-Matrix three main approaches to measure DR can be distinguished:       D   P  T  V       D   superscript   subscript  P  T   V     DP_{T}^{V}         D   P  D  S       D   superscript   subscript  P  D   S     DP_{D}^{S}         D   P  T  S       D   superscript   subscript  P  T   S     DP_{T}^{S}       Type of measurement: volume (V)/singular(S)  Type of view: on time (T)/ delivery (D)   Volume/On Time  Formula  If (     (    D  e  m  a  n   d   p  ,  c     +   B  a  c  k  l  o   g    p  -  1   ,  c      )   >  0          D  e  m  a  n   subscript  d   p  c       B  a  c  k  l  o   subscript  g     p  1   c      0    (Demand_{p,c}+Backlog_{p-1,c})>0   )      D   P  T  V       D   superscript   subscript  P  T   V     DP_{T}^{V}   =      D  e  l  i  v  e  r  e   d   p  ,  c     +   P  r  e  d  e  l  i  v  e  r   y    p  -  1   ,  c        D  e  m  a  n   d   p  ,  c     +   B  a  c  k  l  o   g    p  -  1   ,  c              D  e  l  i  v  e  r  e   subscript  d   p  c       P  r  e  d  e  l  i  v  e  r   subscript  y     p  1   c          D  e  m  a  n   subscript  d   p  c       B  a  c  k  l  o   subscript  g     p  1   c        \frac{Delivered_{p,c}+Predelivery_{p-1,c}}{Demand_{p,c}+Backlog_{p-1,c}}   Else   NULL   Demand:= customers wish c:= product identifier p:= Time period e.g. a day, a week, a month ...  The cumulation over a period and a group of product identifiers c is done as follows:     D   P   p  ,  c     =      ∑   p  ,  c      (   D   P  T  V    )     c  o  u  n   t   p  ,  c     (  D   P  T  V   <  >  N  U  L  L  )           D   subscript  P   p  c         subscript    p  c      D   superscript   subscript  P  T   V      fragments  c  o  u  n   subscript  t   p  c     fragments  normal-(  D   superscript   subscript  P  T   V     N  U  L  L  normal-)       DP_{p,c}=\frac{\sum_{p,c}(DP_{T}^{V})}{count_{p,c}(DP_{T}^{V}<>NULL)}     whereas p is determined by demand period  Singular/Delivery and Singular/On Time  Singular case definition  To fit to the needs of the environment, the granularity of a singular case (    D   P  *  S       D   superscript   subscript  P    S     DP_{*}^{S}   ) has to be defined. In general a singular case is described by a n-Tuple consisting of a set of the following order and delivery details:   order number  customer identifier  product identifier  wish date of customer  confirmed date of supplier  ship to information  delivery date  delivery note number   Formula       D   P  D  S       D   superscript   subscript  P  D   S     DP_{D}^{S}       After a singular case has been delivered to the customer its DP is measured as follows:  If (wish date = arrival date) then  DP singular case =1    else  DP singular case =0       arrival date = delivery date + transit time  By cumulating the results of singular cases over a certain period p and, if necessary, additional criteria c (e.g. customer, product, ...) the delivery performance is calculated as follows:       D   P   p  ,  c     =      ∑   p  ,  c      (   D  P   )     c  o  u  n   t   p  ,  c     (   s  i  n  g  u  l  a  r  c  a  s  e  s   )           D   subscript  P   p  c         subscript    p  c      D  P      c  o  u  n   subscript  t   p  c      s  i  n  g  u  l  a  r  c  a  s  e  s       DP_{p,c}=\frac{\sum_{p,c}(DP)}{count_{p,c}(singularcases)}     whereas p is determined by the arrival date       D   P  T  S       D   superscript   subscript  P  T   S     DP_{T}^{S}       After a period has elapsed all singular cases with wish date within period are considered and their DP is measured as follows:  If (wish date = arrival date) then  DR singular case =1    else  DR singular case =0       arrival date = delivery date + transit time  By cumulating the results of singular cases over a certain period p and, if necessary, additional criteria c (e.g. customer, product, ...) the delivery performance is calculated as follows:       D   P   p  ,  c     =      ∑   p  ,  c      (   D  P   )     c  o  u  n   t   p  ,  c     (   s  i  n  g  u  l  a  r  c  a  s  e  s   )           D   subscript  P   p  c         subscript    p  c      D  P      c  o  u  n   subscript  t   p  c      s  i  n  g  u  l  a  r  c  a  s  e  s       DP_{p,c}=\frac{\sum_{p,c}(DP)}{count_{p,c}(singularcases)}     whereas p is determined by the first confirmed date  Result  0%≤    D   P   T  /  D    S  /  V        D   superscript   subscript  P    T  D      S  V      DP_{T/D}^{S/V}   ≤100%  See also   Delivery Reliability   "  Category:Supply chain management
