   Minkowski functional      Minkowski functional   In mathematics , in the field of functional analysis , a Minkowski functional is a function that recovers a notion of distance on a linear space.  Let K be a symmetric (i.e. if it contains x it also contains - x ) convex body in a linear space V . We define a function p on V as       p   (  x  )    =   inf   {   λ  ∈   ℝ    >  0     :   x  ∈   λ  K    }          p  x    infimum   conditional-set    λ   subscript  ℝ    absent  0       x    λ  K        p(x)=\inf\{\lambda\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}:x\in\lambda K\}     This is the Minkowski functional of K . 1 Usually it is assumed that K is such that the set of   λ   λ   \lambda   is never empty, but sometimes the set is allowed to be empty and then p(x) is defined as infinity.  Motivation  Example 1  Consider a normed vector space  X , with the norm ||·||. Let K be the unit ball in X . Define a function p : X →  R by        p   (  x  )    =   inf   {   r  >  0   :   x  ∈   r  K    }     .        p  x    infimum   conditional-set    r  0     x    r  K        p(x)=\inf\left\{r>0:x\in rK\right\}.     One can see that     p   (  x  )    =   ∥  x  ∥         p  x    norm  x     p(x)=\|x\|   , i.e. p is just the norm on X . The function p is a special case of a Minkowski functional.  Example 2  Let X be a vector space without topology with underlying scalar field K . Take ''φ ∈ X' '', the algebraic dual of X , i.e. φ : X →  K is a linear functional on X . Fix a > 0 . Let the set K be given by       K  =   {   x  ∈  X   :    |   ϕ   (  x  )    |   ≤  a   }    .      K   conditional-set    x  X         ϕ  x    a      K=\{x\in X:|\phi(x)|\leq a\}.     Again we define        p   (  x  )    =   inf   {   r  >  0   :   x  ∈   r  K    }     .        p  x    infimum   conditional-set    r  0     x    r  K        p(x)=\inf\left\{r>0:x\in rK\right\}.     Then        p   (  x  )    =    1  a    |   ϕ   (  x  )    |     .        p  x       1  a       ϕ  x       p(x)=\frac{1}{a}|\phi(x)|.     The function p ( x ) is another instance of a Minkowski functional. It has the following properties:   It is subadditive : p ( x + y ) ≤ p ( x ) + p ( y ),  It is homogeneous : for all α ∈ K , p ( α x ) = | α | p ( x ),  It is nonnegative.   Therefore p is a seminorm on X , with an induced topology. This is characteristic of Minkowski functionals defined via "nice" sets. There is a one-to-one correspondence between seminorms and the Minkowski functional given by such sets. What is meant precisely by "nice" is discussed in the section below.  Notice that, in contrast to a stronger requirement for a norm, p(x) = 0 need not imply x = 0 . In the above example, one can take a nonzero x from the kernel of φ . Consequently, the resulting topology need not be Hausdorff .  Definition  The above examples suggest that, given a (complex or real) vector space X and a subset K , one can define a corresponding Minkowski functional       p  K   :   X  →   [  0  ,  ∞  )       normal-:   subscript  p  K    normal-→  X   0       p_{K}:X\rightarrow[0,\infty)     by         p  K    (  x  )    =   inf   {   r  >  0   :   x  ∈   r  K    }     ,         subscript  p  K   x    infimum   conditional-set    r  0     x    r  K        p_{K}(x)=\inf\left\{r>0:x\in rK\right\},     which is often called the gauge of   K   K   K   .  It is implicitly assumed in this definition that 0 ∈ K and the set { r > 0: x ∈ r K } is nonempty. In order for p K to have the properties of a seminorm, additional restrictions must be imposed on K . These conditions are listed below.   The set K being convex implies the subadditivity of p K .  Homogeneity , i.e. p K ( α x ) = | α | p K ( x ) for all α , is ensured if K is balanced , meaning α K ⊂ K for all | α | ≤ 1.   A set K with these properties is said to be absolutely convex .  Convexity of K  A simple geometric argument that shows convexity of K implies subadditivity is as follows. Suppose for the moment that p K ( x ) = p K ( y ) = r . Then for all ε > 0, we have x , y ∈ ( r + ε ) K = '' K' ''. The assumption that K is convex means '' K' '' is also. Therefore ½ x + ½ y is in '' K' ''. By definition of the Minkowski functional p K , one has         p  K    (     1  2   x   +    1  2   y    )    ≤   r  +  ϵ   =     1  2    p  K    (  x  )    +    1  2    p  K    (  y  )    +  ϵ    .           subscript  p  K         1  2   x       1  2   y       r  ϵ              1  2    subscript  p  K   x       1  2    subscript  p  K   y   ϵ      p_{K}\left(\frac{1}{2}x+\frac{1}{2}y\right)\leq r+\epsilon=\frac{1}{2}p_{K}(x)%
 +\frac{1}{2}p_{K}(y)+\epsilon.     But the left hand side is ½ p K ( x + y ), i.e. the above becomes         p  K    (   x  +  y   )    ≤      p  K    (  x  )    +    p  K    (  y  )    +  ϵ   ,  for all     ϵ  >  0.      formulae-sequence       subscript  p  K     x  y          subscript  p  K   x      subscript  p  K   y   ϵ   for all      ϵ  0.     p_{K}(x+y)\leq p_{K}(x)+p_{K}(y)+\epsilon,\quad\mbox{for all}\quad\epsilon>0.     This is the desired inequality. The general case p K ( x ) > p K ( y ) is obtained after the obvious modification.  Note Convexity of K , together with the initial assumption that the set { r > 0: x ∈ r K } is nonempty, implies that K is absorbent .  Balancedness of K  Notice that K being balanced implies that         λ  x   ∈    r  K   if and only if     x  ∈    r   |  λ  |    K     .     formulae-sequence      λ  x      r  K   if and only if      x      r    λ    K      \lambda x\in rK\quad\mbox{if and only if}\quad x\in\frac{r}{|\lambda|}K.     Therefore         p  K    (   λ  x   )    =   inf   {   r  >  0   :    λ  x   ∈   r  K    }    =   inf   {   r  >  0   :   x  ∈    r   |  λ  |    K    }    =   inf   {     |  λ  |    r   |  λ  |     >  0   :   x  ∈    r   |  λ  |    K    }    =    |  λ  |    p  K    (  x  )     .           subscript  p  K     λ  x     infimum   conditional-set    r  0       λ  x     r  K            infimum   conditional-set    r  0     x      r    λ    K            infimum   conditional-set        λ     r    λ     0     x      r    λ    K               λ    subscript  p  K   x      p_{K}(\lambda x)=\inf\left\{r>0:\lambda x\in rK\right\}=\inf\left\{r>0:x\in%
 \frac{r}{|\lambda|}K\right\}=\inf\left\{|\lambda|\frac{r}{|\lambda|}>0:x\in%
 \frac{r}{|\lambda|}K\right\}=|\lambda|p_{K}(x).     See also   Hadwiger's theorem  Hugo Hadwiger  Morphological image processing   Notes  References     "  Category:Functional analysis  Category:Convex analysis     Thompson (1996) p.17 ↩
