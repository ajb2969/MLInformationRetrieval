   Necklace ring      Necklace ring   In mathematics, the necklace ring is a ring introduced by .  Definition  If A is a commutative ring then the necklace ring over A consists of all infinite sequences ( a 1 , a 2 ,...) of elements of A . Addition in the necklace ring is given by pointwise addition of sequences. Multiplication is given by a sort of arithmetic convolution: the product of ( a 1 , a 2 ,...) and ( b 1 , b 2 ,...) has components       c  n   =    âˆ‘    [  i  ,  j  ]   =  n      (  i  ,  j  )    a  i    b  j          subscript  c  n     subscript      i  j   n       i  j    subscript  a  i    subscript  b  j       \displaystyle c_{n}=\sum_{[i,j]=n}(i,j)a_{i}b_{j}   where [ i , j ] is the least common multiple of i and j , and ( i , j ) is their highest common factor .
