Connection (composite bundle)

Composite bundles 
 
 
 
  play a prominent role in gauge theory with symmetry breaking, e.g., gauge gravitation theory, non-autonomous mechanics where 
 
 
 
  is the time axis, e.g., mechanics with time-dependent parameters, and so on. There are the important relations between connections on fiber bundles

 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Composite bundle
In differential geometry by a composite bundle is meant the composition



of fiber bundles



It is provided with bundle coordinates 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  are bundle coordinates on a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
 , i.e., transition functions of coordinates 
 
 
 
  are independent of coordinates 
 
 
 
 .
The following fact provides the above mentioned physical applications of composite bundles. Given the composite bundle (1), let 
 
 
 
  be a global section of a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
 , if any. Then the pullback bundle

 
  over 
 
 
 
  is a subbundle of a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
 .
Composite principal bundle
For instance, let 
 
 
 
  be a principal bundle with a structure Lie group 
 
 
 
  which is reducible to its closed subgroup 
 
 
 
 . There is a composite bundle 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a principal bundle with a structure group 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a fiber bundle associated with 
 
 
 
 . Given a global section 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , the pullback bundle 
 
 
 
  is a reduced principal subbundle of 
 
 
 
  with a structure group 
 
 
 
 . In gauge theory, sections of 
 
 
 
  are treated as classical Higgs fields.
Jet manifolds of a composite bundle
Given the composite bundle 
 
 
 
  (1), let us consider the jet manifolds

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  of the fiber bundles 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. They are provided with the adapted coordinates 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 

There is the canonical map


 
 .
Composite connection
This canonical map defines the relations between connections on fiber bundles 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . These connections are given by the corresponding tangent-valued connection forms









A connection 
 
 
 
  on a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
  and a connection 
 
 
 
  on a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
  define a connection



on a composite bundle 
 
 
 
 . It is called the composite connection. This is a unique connection such that the horizontal lift

 
  onto 
 
 
 
  of a vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  by means of the composite connection 
 
 
 
  coincides with the composition 
 
 
 
  of horizontal lifts of 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
  by means of a connection 
 
 
 
  and then onto 
 
 
 
  by means of a connection 
 
 
 
 .
Vertical covariant differential
Given the composite bundle 
 
 
 
  (1), there is the following exact sequence of vector bundles over 
 
 
 
 :



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the vertical tangent bundle and the vertical cotangent bundle of 
 
 
 
 . Every connection 
 
 
 
  on a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
  yields the splitting



of the exact sequence (2). Using this splitting, one can construct a first order differential operator



on a composite bundle 
 
 
 
 . It is called the vertical covariant differential. It possesses the following important property.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a section of a fiber bundle 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be the pullback bundle over 
 
 
 
 . Every connection 
 
 
 
  induces the pullback connection



on 
 
 
 
 . Then the restriction of a vertical covariant differential 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  coincides with the familiar covariant differential

 
  on 
 
 
 
  relative to the pullback connection 
 
 
 
 .
