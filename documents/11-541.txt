   Phosphoserine phosphatase      Phosphoserine phosphatase   In enzymology , a phosphoserine phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   O-phospho-L(or D)-serine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L(or D)-serine + phosphate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are O-phospho-L-serine , O-phospho-D-serine , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are L-serine , D-serine , and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is O-phosphoserine phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
