Rapid shallow breathing index

The rapid shallow breathing index (RSBI) is a tool that is used in the weaning of Mechanical ventilation on intensive care units. The RSBI is defined as the ratio of respiratory frequency to tidal volume (f/VT). People on a ventilator who cannot tolerate independent breathing tend to breathe rapidly (high frequency) and shallowly (low tidal volume), and will therefore have a high RSBI.1
Equation



Measurement
Measurement is done with a handheld spirometer attached to the endotracheal tube while a patient breathes room air for one minute without any ventilator assistance.2
Example
As an example, a patient who has a respiratory rate of 25 breaths/min and a tidal volume of 250 mL/breath has an RSBI of (25 breaths/min)/(0.25 L) = 100 breaths/min/L
Likelihood ratio




Likelihood ratio (LR)

Calculation

Change in probability of success or failure





LR positive

Sensitivity/(1-specificity)

LR = 1-2, none/minimal





LR = 2-5, small





LR = 5-10, moderate





LR >10 = large



LR negative

(1-sensitivity)/specificity

LR = 0.5-1, none/minimal





LR = 0.3-0.5, small





LR = 0.1-0.3, moderate





LR <0.1 = large





LR: likelihood ratio.



History
The concept was introduced in a 1991 paper by physicians from the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston and Stritch School of Medicine at Loyola University in Chicago.3
Weaning Readiness
An RSBI score of less than 654 indicating a relatively low respiratory rate compared to tidal volume is generally considered as an indication of weaning readiness.
