   Vomilenine reductase      Vomilenine reductase   In enzymology , a vomilenine reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,2-dihydrovomilenine + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   vomilenine + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,2-dihydrovomilenine and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are vomilenine , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,2-dihydrovomilenine:NADP+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis .
