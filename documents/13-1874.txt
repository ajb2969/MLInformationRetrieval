1992 AX makes occasional close approaches to Mars. Its next close approach, on January 22, 2027, will bring it  from Mars.1
Moon
1992 AX has one natural satellite, S/1997 (5407) 1. However, the true presence of a moon is still considered inconclusive.2 If it exists, the moon completes one orbit around 1992 AX every 13.5196 hours at a distance of 6.8 km. S/1997 (5407) 1 is 1.2 km wide.3 From the surface of 1992 AX, S/1997 (5407) 1 would have an angular diameter of roughly 14.3°.4 For comparison, the Sun appears to be 0.5° from Earth.
