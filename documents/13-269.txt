Segre class

In mathematics, the Segre class is a characteristic class used in the study of singular vector bundles. The total Segre class is inverse to the total Chern class, and thus provides equivalent information; the advantage of the Segre class is that it generalizes to singular vector bundles, while the Chern class does not. The Segre class is named after Beniamino Segre.
Definition
For a holomorphic vector bundle

 
  over a complex manifold

 
  a total Segre class 
 
 
 
  is the inverse to the total Chern class

 
 
 , see e.g.1
Explicitly, for a total Chern class



one gets the total Segre class



where



Let 
 
 
 
  be Chern roots, i.e. formal eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a curvature of a connection on 
 
 
 
 .
While the Chern class s(E) is written as



where 
 
 
 
  is an elementary symmetric polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
 
  in variables 
 
 

the Segre for the dual bundle

 
  which has Chern roots 
 
 
 
  is written as



Expanding the above expression in powers of 
 
 
 
 
  one can see that 
 
 
 
  is represented by a complete homogeneous symmetric polynomial of
