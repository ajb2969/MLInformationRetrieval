Alpha-L-fucosidase




Alpha-L-fucosidase

In enzymology, an alpha-L-fucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

an alpha-L-fucoside + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-fucose + an alcohol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are alpha-L-fucoside and H2O, whereas its two products are L-fucose and alcohol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-L-fucoside fucohydrolase. This enzyme is also called alpha-fucosidase. This enzyme participates in n-glycan degradation and glycan structures - degradation.
Defiiciency of this enzyme is called Fucosidosis.
In CAZy, alpha-L-fucosidases are found in glycoside hydrolase family 29 and glycoside hydrolase family 95.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
