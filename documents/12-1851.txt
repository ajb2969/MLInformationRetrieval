Duality (mechanical engineering)

In mechanical engineering, many terms are associated into pairs called duals. A dual of a relationship is formed by interchanging force (stress) and deformation (strain) in an expression.
Here is a partial list of mechanical dualities:

force — deformation
stress — strain
stiffness method — flexibility method

Examples
Constitutive relation

stress and strain (Hooke's law.)
