   Duality (mechanical engineering)      Duality (mechanical engineering)   In mechanical engineering , many terms are associated into pairs called duals . A dual of a relationship is formed by interchanging force (stress) and deformation (strain) in an expression.  Here is a partial list of mechanical dualities:   force — deformation  stress — strain  stiffness method — flexibility method   Examples  Constitutive relation   stress and strain ( Hooke's law .)          σ  =   E  ε    ⇔   ε  =    1  E    σ        iff    σ    E  ε      ε      1  E   σ      \sigma=E\varepsilon\iff\varepsilon=\frac{1}{E}\sigma\,        See also   Duality (electrical circuits)   References   Fung, Y.
