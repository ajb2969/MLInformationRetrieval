A wedge has five faces, nine edges, and six vertices.  A wedge is a subclass of the prismatoids with the base and opposite ridge in two parallel planes.  A wedge can also be classified as a digonal  cupola .  Wedges can be created from decomposition of other polyhedra. For instance, the dodecahedron can be divided into a central cube with 6 wedges covering the cube faces. The orientations of the wedges are such that the triangle and trapezoid faces can connect and form a regular pentagon .  A triangular prism is a special case wedge with the two triangle faces being translationally congruent.  Comparisons:   A wedge is a parallelepiped where a face has collapsed into a line.  A quadrilaterally-based pyramid is a wedge in which one of the edges between two trapezoid faces has collapsed into a point.   For a rectangle based wedge, the volume is       V  =   b  h   (    a  3   +   c  6    )     ,      V    b  h      a  3     c  6       V=bh\left(\frac{a}{3}+\frac{c}{6}\right),   where the base rectangle is a by b , c is the apex edge length parallel to a , and h the height from the base rectangle to the apex edge.
