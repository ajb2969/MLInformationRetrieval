   Metaplectic group      Metaplectic group   In mathematics , the metaplectic group Mp 2 n is a double cover of the symplectic group Sp 2 n . It can be defined over either real or p -adic numbers . The construction covers more generally the case of an arbitrary local or finite field , and even the ring of adeles .  The metaplectic group has a particularly significant infinite-dimensional linear representation , the Weil representation . 1 It was used by André Weil to give a representation-theoretic interpretation of theta functions , and is important in the theory of modular forms of half-integral weight and the theta correspondence .  Definition  The fundamental group of the symplectic Lie group Sp 2n ( R ) is infinite cyclic , so it has a unique connected double cover, which is denoted Mp 2 n ( R ) and called the metaplectic group .  The metaplectic group Mp 2 ( R ) is not a matrix group : it has no faithful finite-dimensional representations . Therefore, the question of its explicit realization is nontrivial. It has faithful irreducible infinite-dimensional representations, such as the Weil representation described below.  It can be proved that if F is any local field other than C , then the symplectic group Sp 2 n ( F ) admits a unique perfect  central extension with the kernel Z /2 Z , the cyclic group of order 2, which is called the metaplectic group over F . It serves as an algebraic replacement of the topological notion of a 2-fold cover used when . The approach through the notion of central extension is useful even in the case of real metaplectic group, because it allows a description of the group operation via a certain cocycle .  == Explicit construction for n = 1 ==  In the case , the symplectic group coincides with the special linear group  SL 2 ( R ) . This group biholomorphically acts on the complex upper half-plane by fractional-linear transformations,       g  ⋅  z   =     a  z   +  b     c  z   +  d         normal-⋅  g  z         a  z   b       c  z   d      g\cdot z=\frac{az+b}{cz+d}   where    g  =   (     a     b  ;       c     d  ;      )   ∈    SL  2    (  ℝ  )          g    a  b    c  d            subscript  SL  2   ℝ      g=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}\in\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R})     is a real 2-by-2 matrix with the unit determinant and z is in the upper half-plane, and this action can be used to explicitly construct the metaplectic cover of SL 2 ( R ).  The elements of the metaplectic group Mp 2 ( R ) are the pairs ( g , ε ), where        g  ∈    SL  2    (  ℝ  )     ,    ϵ  2   =    c  z   +  d   =   j   (   g  ⋅  z   )      ,     formulae-sequence    g     subscript  SL  2   ℝ         superscript  ϵ  2       c  z   d          j   normal-⋅  g  z        g\in\mathrm{SL}_{2}(\mathbb{R}),\epsilon^{2}=cz+d=j(g\cdot z),     so that ε is a choice of one of the two branches of the complex square root function of j ( gz ) for z in the complex upper half-plane. The multiplication law is defined by:         (   g  1   ,   ϵ  1   )   ⋅   (   g  2   ,   ϵ  2   )    =   (    g  1    g  2    ,  ϵ  )    ,       normal-⋅    subscript  g  1    subscript  ϵ  1      subscript  g  2    subscript  ϵ  2         subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2    ϵ     (g_{1},\epsilon_{1})\cdot(g_{2},\epsilon_{2})=(g_{1}g_{2},\epsilon),   where      ϵ   (  z  )    =    ϵ  1    (    g  2   ⋅  z   )    ϵ  2    (  z  )     .        ϵ  z      subscript  ϵ  1    normal-⋅   subscript  g  2   z    subscript  ϵ  2   z     \epsilon(z)=\epsilon_{1}(g_{2}\cdot z)\epsilon_{2}(z).     The associativity of this product follows from a certain cocycle condition satisfied by ε ( z ). The map       (  g  ,  ϵ  )   ↦  g     maps-to   g  ϵ   g    (g,\epsilon)\mapsto g     is a surjection from Mp 2 ( R ) to SL 2 ( R ) which does not admit a continuous section. Hence, we have constructed a non-trivial 2-fold cover of the latter group.  Construction of the Weil representation  We first give a rather abstract reason why the Weil representation exists. The Heisenberg group has an irreducible unitary representation on a Hilbert space   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   , that is,      ρ  :    ℍ   (  V  )    ⟶   U   (  ℋ  )        normal-:  ρ   normal-⟶    ℍ  V     U  ℋ      \rho:\mathbb{H}(V)\longrightarrow U(\mathcal{H})   with the center acting as a given nonzero constant. The Stone–von Neumann theorem states that this representation is essentially unique: if    ρ  ′     superscript  ρ  normal-′    \rho^{\prime}   is another such representation, there exists an automorphism      ψ  ∈   U   (  ℋ  )        ψ    U  ℋ     \psi\in U(\mathcal{H})   such that     ρ  ′   =    Ad  ψ    (  ρ  )         superscript  ρ  normal-′      subscript  Ad  ψ   ρ     \rho^{\prime}=\mathrm{Ad}_{\psi}(\rho)   . and the conjugating automorphism is projectively unique, i.e., up to a multiplicative modulus 1 constant. So any automorphism of the Heisenberg group, inducing the identity on the center, acts on this representation   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   —to be precise, the action is only well-defined up to multiplication by a non-zero constant.  The automorphisms of the Heisenberg group (fixing its center) form the symplectic group , so at first sight this seems to give an action of the symplectic group on   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   . However, the action is only defined up to multiplication by a nonzero constant, in other words, one can only map the automorphism of the group to the class     [  ψ  ]   ∈   P  U   (  ℋ  )         delimited-[]  ψ     P  U  ℋ     [\psi]\in PU(\mathcal{H})   . So we only get a homomorphism from the symplectic group to the projective unitary group of H ; in other words a projective representation . The general theory of projective representations then applies, to give an action of some central extension of the symplectic group on H . A calculation shows that this central extension can be taken to be a double cover, and this double cover is the metaplectic group.  Now we give a more concrete construction in the simplest case of Mp 2 ( R ). The Hilbert space H is then the space of all L 2 functions on the reals. The Heisenberg group is generated by translations and multiplication by the functions e ixy of x , for y real. Then the action of the metaplectic group on H is generated by the Fourier transform and multiplication by the functions exp( ix 2 y ) of x , for y real.  Generalizations  Weil showed how to extend the theory above by replacing R by any locally compact group G that is isomorphic to its Pontryagin dual (the group of characters). The Hilbert space H is then the space of all L 2 functions on G . The (analogue of) the Heisenberg group is generated by translations by elements of G , and multiplication by elements of the dual group (considered as functions from G to the unit circle). There is an analogue of the symplectic group acting on the Heisenberg group, and this action lifts to a projective representation on H . The corresponding central extension of the symplectic group is called the metaplectic group.  Some important examples of this construction are given by:   G is a vector space over the reals of dimension n . This gives a metaplectic group that is a double cover of the symplectic group Sp 2 n ( R ).    More generally G can be a vector space over any local field  F of dimension n . This gives a metaplectic group that is a double cover of the symplectic group Sp 2 n ( F ).    G is a vector space over the adeles of a number field (or global field ). This case is used in the representation-theoretic approach to automorphic forms .    G is a finite group. The corresponding metaplectic group is then also finite, and the central cover is trivial. This case is used in the theory of theta functions of lattices, where typically G will be the discriminant group of an even lattice .    A modern point of view on the existence of the linear (not projective) Weil representation over a finite field, namely, that it admits a canonical Hilbert space realization, was proposed by David Kazhdan . Using the notion of canonical intertwining operators suggested by Joseph Bernstein , such a realization was constructed by Gurevich-Hadani. 2   See also   Heisenberg group  Metaplectic structure  Reductive dual pair  Spin group , another double cover  Symplectic group  Theta function   Notes  References         "  Category:Fourier analysis  Category:Topology of Lie groups  Category:Theta functions     ↩  http://arxiv.org/abs/0705.4556 ↩
