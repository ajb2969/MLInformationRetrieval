Trigamma function

(Figure)
Color representation of the Trigamma function, 
 
 
 
 , in a rectangular region of the complex plane. It is generated using Domain coloring method.

In mathematics, the trigamma function, denoted 
 
 
 
 , is the second of the polygamma functions, and is defined by


 
 .
It follows from this definition that



where 
 
 
 
  is the digamma function. It may also be defined as the sum of the series



making it a special case of the Hurwitz zeta function



Note that the last two formulæ are valid when 
 
 
 
  is not a natural number.
Calculation
A double integral representation, as an alternative to the ones given above, may be derived from the series representation:



using the formula for the sum of a geometric series. Integration by parts yields:



An asymptotic expansion as a Laurent series is



if we have chosen 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the Bernoulli numbers of the second kind.
Recurrence and reflection formulae
The trigamma function satisfies the recurrence relation



and the reflection formula



which immediately gives the value for z=1/2.
Special values
The trigamma function has the following special values:















where K represents Catalan's constant.
There are no roots on the real axis of 
 
 
 
 , but there exist infinitely many pairs of roots 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . Each such pair of root approach 
 
 
 
  quickly and their imaginary part increases slowly logarithmic with n. E.g. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the first two roots with 
 
 
 
 .
Appearance
The trigamma function appears in the next surprising sum formula:1
