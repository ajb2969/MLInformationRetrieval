   Fluorine perchlorate      Fluorine perchlorate   Fluorine perchlorate is the rarely encountered chemical compound of fluorine , chlorine , and oxygen with the chemical formula or . It is an extremely unstable gas that explodes spontaneously 1 and has a penetrating odor. 2  Synthesis  One synthesis uses fluorine and perchloric acid , 3 though the action of ClF 5 on water is another method.

It contains an oxygen atom in a rare oxidation state of 0, due to the electronegativity of oxygen, which is higher than that of chlorine but lower than that of fluorine.  Safety  FClO 4 has a very dangerous and unpredictable series of reactions associated with it, as a covalent perchlorate (chlorine in the +7 oxidation state) and a compound featuring a very sensitive O-F single bond. Small amounts of reducing agent, such as organic compounds , can trigger explosive detonation. Products of these decomposition reactions could include oxygen halides, interhalogen compounds, and other hazardous substances.  Accidental synthesis is possible if precursors are carelessly mixed. Like similar covalent fluorides and perchlorates, it needs to be handled with extreme caution.  Reaction  FClO 4 is a strong oxidant and it reacts with iodide ion:   FOClO 3 + 2I − → ClO 4 − + F − + I 2    FClO 4 can also react with tetrafluoroethylene : 5   CF 2 =CF 2 + FOClO 3 → CF 3 CF 2 OClO 3    It may be a radical  addition reaction . 6  References  External links   Chemist Derek Lowe 's experiences with perchlorates   "  Category:Explosive chemicals  Category:Perchlorates  Category:Oxidizing agents     Pradyot Patnaik.
