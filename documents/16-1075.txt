   Rational series      Rational series   In mathematics and computer science, a rational series is a generalisation of the concept of formal power series over a ring to the case when the basic algebraic structure is no longer a ring but a semiring , and the indeterminates adjoined are not assumed to commute . They can be regarded as algebraic expressions of a formal language over a finite alphabet .  Definition  Let R be a semiring and A a finite alphabet.  A noncommutative polynomial over A is a finite formal sum of words over A . They form a semiring    R   ⟨  A  ⟩       R   delimited-⟨⟩  A     R\langle A\rangle   .  A formal series is a R -valued function c , on the free monoid  A * , which may be written as        ∑   w  ∈   A  *      c   (  w  )    w     .      subscript     w   superscript  A        c  w  w     \sum_{w\in A^{*}}c(w)w\ .     The set of formal series is denoted    R   ⟨   ⟨  A  ⟩   ⟩       R   delimited-⟨⟩   delimited-⟨⟩  A      R\langle\langle A\rangle\rangle   and becomes a semiring under the operations       c  +  d   :   w  ↦    c   (  w  )    +   d   (  w  )         normal-:    c  d    maps-to  w      c  w     d  w       c+d:w\mapsto c(w)+d(w)           c  ⋅  d   :   w  ↦    ∑    u  v   =  w       c   (  u  )    ⋅  d    (  v  )       .     normal-:   normal-⋅  c  d    maps-to  w    subscript       u  v   w       normal-⋅    c  u   d   v       c\cdot d:w\mapsto\sum_{uv=w}c(u)\cdot d(v)\ .     A non-commutative polynomial thus corresponds to a function c on A * of finite support.  In the case when R is a ring, then this is the Magnus ring over R . 1  If L is a language over A , regarded as a subset of A * we can form the characteristic series of L as the formal series       ∑   w  ∈  L    w      subscript     w  L    w    \sum_{w\in L}w     corresponding to the characteristic function of L .  In    R   ⟨   ⟨  A  ⟩   ⟩       R   delimited-⟨⟩   delimited-⟨⟩  A      R\langle\langle A\rangle\rangle   one can define an operation of iteration expressed as       S  *   =    ∑   n  ≥  0     S  n         superscript  S      subscript     n  0     superscript  S  n      S^{*}=\sum_{n\geq 0}S^{n}     and formalised as         c  *    (  w  )    =    ∑     u  1    u  2   ⋯   u  n    =  w     c   (   u  1   )   c   (   u  2   )   ⋯  c   (   u  n   )      .         superscript  c    w     subscript        subscript  u  1    subscript  u  2   normal-⋯   subscript  u  n    w      c   subscript  u  1   c   subscript  u  2   normal-⋯  c   subscript  u  n       c^{*}(w)=\sum_{u_{1}u_{2}\cdots u_{n}=w}c(u_{1})c(u_{2})\cdots c(u_{n})\ .     The rational operations are the addition and multiplication of formal series, together with iteration. A rational series is a formal series obtained by rational operations from    R   ⟨  A  ⟩       R   delimited-⟨⟩  A     R\langle A\rangle   .
