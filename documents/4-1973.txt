   Heine–Cantor theorem      Heine–Cantor theorem   In mathematics , the Heine–Cantor theorem , named after Eduard Heine and Georg Cantor , states that if f : M → N is a continuous function between two metric spaces , and M is compact , then f is uniformly continuous . An important special case is that every continuous function from a closed interval to the real numbers is uniformly continuous.  Proof  Suppose that M and N are two metric spaces with metrics d M and d N , respectively. Suppose further that    f  :   M  →  N      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  N     f:M\to N   is continuous, and that M is compact. We want to show that f is uniformly continuous, that is, for every    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   there exists    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   such that for all points x , y in the domain M ,      d  M    (  x  ,  y  )    <  δ         subscript  d  M    x  y    δ    d_{M}(x,y)<\delta   implies that      d  N    (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    <  ϵ         subscript  d  N      f  x     f  y     ϵ    d_{N}(f(x),f(y))<\epsilon   .  Fix some positive    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   . Then by continuity, for any point x in our domain M , there exists a positive real number     δ  x   >  0       subscript  δ  x   0    \delta_{x}>0   such that      d  M    (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    <   ϵ  /  2          subscript  d  M      f  x     f  y       ϵ  2     d_{M}(f(x),f(y))<\epsilon/2   when y is within    δ  x     subscript  δ  x    \delta_{x}   of x .  Let U x be the open     δ  x   /  2       subscript  δ  x   2    \delta_{x}/2   -neighborhood of x , i.e. the set       U  x   =   {  y  ∣     d  M    (  x  ,  y  )    <    1  2    δ  x     }        subscript  U  x    conditional-set  y       subscript  d  M    x  y        1  2    subscript  δ  x        U_{x}=\left\{y\mid d_{M}(x,y)<\frac{1}{2}\delta_{x}\right\}     Since each point x is contained in its own U x , we find that the collection    {   U  x   ∣   x  ∈  M   }     conditional-set   subscript  U  x     x  M     \{U_{x}\mid x\in M\}   is an open cover of M . Since M is compact, this cover has a finite subcover. That subcover must be of the form       U   x  1    ,   U   x  2    ,  …  ,   U   x  n        subscript  U   subscript  x  1     subscript  U   subscript  x  2    normal-…   subscript  U   subscript  x  n      U_{x_{1}},U_{x_{2}},\ldots,U_{x_{n}}     for some finite set of points     {   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   }   ⊂  M        subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n    M    \{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\}\subset M   . Each of these open sets has an associated radius     δ   x  i    /  2       subscript  δ   subscript  x  i    2    \delta_{x_{i}}/2   . Let us now define    δ  =    min   1  ≤  i  ≤  n      1  2    δ   x  i          δ    subscript       1  i       n         1  2    subscript  δ   subscript  x  i        \delta=\min_{1\leq i\leq n}\frac{1}{2}\delta_{x_{i}}   , i.e. the minimum radius of these open sets. Since we have a finite number of positive radii, this number   δ   δ   \delta   is well-defined. We may now show that this   δ   δ   \delta   works for the definition of uniform continuity.  Suppose that      d  M    (  x  ,  y  )    <  δ         subscript  d  M    x  y    δ    d_{M}(x,y)<\delta   for any two x,y in M . Since the sets    U   x  i      subscript  U   subscript  x  i     U_{x_{i}}   form an open (sub)cover of our space M , we know that x must lie within one of them, say    U   x  i      subscript  U   subscript  x  i     U_{x_{i}}   . Then we have that      d  M    (  x  ,   x  i   )    <    1  2    δ   x  i            subscript  d  M    x   subscript  x  i         1  2    subscript  δ   subscript  x  i       d_{M}(x,x_{i})<\frac{1}{2}\delta_{x_{i}}   . The Triangle Inequality then implies that        d  M    (   x  i   ,  y  )    ≤     d  M    (   x  i   ,  x  )    +    d  M    (  x  ,  y  )     <     1  2    δ   x  i     +  δ   ≤   δ   x  i             subscript  d  M     subscript  x  i   y         subscript  d  M     subscript  x  i   x       subscript  d  M    x  y                1  2    subscript  δ   subscript  x  i     δ         subscript  δ   subscript  x  i       d_{M}(x_{i},y)\leq d_{M}(x_{i},x)+d_{M}(x,y)<\frac{1}{2}\delta_{x_{i}}+\delta%
 \leq\delta_{x_{i}}     implying that x and y are both at most    δ   x  i      subscript  δ   subscript  x  i     \delta_{x_{i}}   away from x i . By definition of    δ   x  i      subscript  δ   subscript  x  i     \delta_{x_{i}}   , this implies that     d  N    (   f   (   x  i   )    ,   f   (  x  )    )        subscript  d  N      f   subscript  x  i      f  x      d_{N}(f(x_{i}),f(x))   and     d  N    (   f   (   x  i   )    ,   f   (  y  )    )        subscript  d  N      f   subscript  x  i      f  y      d_{N}(f(x_{i}),f(y))   are both less than    ϵ  /  2      ϵ  2    \epsilon/2   . Applying the Triangle Inequality then yields the desired        d  N    (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    ≤     d  N    (   f   (   x  i   )    ,   f   (  x  )    )    +    d  N    (   f   (   x  i   )    ,   f   (  y  )    )     <     1  2   ϵ   +    1  2   ϵ    =  ϵ           subscript  d  N      f  x     f  y          subscript  d  N      f   subscript  x  i      f  x        subscript  d  N      f   subscript  x  i      f  y                 1  2   ϵ       1  2   ϵ         ϵ     d_{N}(f(x),f(y))\leq d_{N}(f(x_{i}),f(x))+d_{N}(f(x_{i}),f(y))<\frac{1}{2}%
