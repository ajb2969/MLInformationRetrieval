   Glossary of invariant theory      Glossary of invariant theory   This page is a glossary of terms in invariant theory . For descriptions of particular invariant rings, see invariants of a binary form , symmetric polynomials . For geometric terms used in invariant theory see the glossary of classical algebraic geometry . Definitions of many terms used in invariant theory can be found in , , , , , , , , and the index to the fourth volume of Sylvester's collected works includes many of the terms invented by him.
