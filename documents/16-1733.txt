Jost function

In scattering theory, the Jost function is the Wronskian of the regular solution and the (irregular) Jost solution to the differential equation

 
 . It was introduced by Res Jost.
Background
We are looking for solutions 
 
 
 
  to the radial Schr√∂dinger equation in the case 
 
 
 
 ,



Regular and irregular solutions
A regular solution

 
  is one that satisfies the boundary conditions,



If 
 
 
 
 , the solution is given as a Volterra integral equation,



We have two irregular solutions (sometimes called Jost solutions) 
 
 
 
  with asymptotic behavior 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . They are given by the Volterra integral equation,



If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  are linearly independent. Since they are solutions to a second order differential equation, every solution (in particular 
 
 
 
 ) can be written as a linear combination of them.
Jost function definition
The Jost function is


 
 ,
where W is the Wronskian. Since 
 
 
 
  are both solutions to the same differential equation, the Wronskian is independent of r. So evaluating at 
 
 
 
  and using the boundary conditions on 
 
 
 
  yields 
 
 
 
 .
Applications
The Jost function can be used to construct Green's functions for



In fact,



where 
 
 
 
  and
