   Ak singularity      Ak singularity   In mathematics , and in particular singularity theory an A k , where k ≥ 0 is an integer , describes a level of degeneracy of a function . The notation was introduced by V. I. Arnold .  Let f : R n → R be a smooth function . We denote by Ω( R n , R ) the infinite-dimensional space of all such functions. Let diff( R n ) denote the infinite-dimensional Lie group of diffeomorphisms  R n → R n , and diff( R ) the infinite-dimensional Lie group of diffeomorphisms R → R . The product group diff( R n ) × diff( R ) acts on Ω( R n , R ) in the following way: let φ : R n → R n and ψ : R → R be diffeormorphisms and f : R n → R any smooth function. We define the group action as follows:        (  φ  ,  ψ  )   ⋅  f   :=   ψ  ∘  f  ∘   φ   -  1        assign   normal-⋅   φ  ψ   f     ψ  f   superscript  φ    1       (\varphi,\psi)\cdot f:=\psi\circ f\circ\varphi^{-1}   The orbit of f , denoted orb( f ), of this group action is given by        orb   (  f  )    =   {   ψ  ∘  f  ∘   φ   -  1     :    φ  ∈   diff   (   ℝ  n   )     ,   ψ  ∈   diff   (  ℝ  )      }    .        orb  f    conditional-set    ψ  f   superscript  φ    1      formulae-sequence    φ    diff   superscript  ℝ  n       ψ    diff  ℝ        \mbox{orb}(f)=\{\psi\circ f\circ\varphi^{-1}:\varphi\in\mbox{diff}({\mathbb{R}%
 }^{n}),\psi\in\mbox{diff}({\mathbb{R}})\}\ .     The members of a given orbit of this action have the following fact in common: we can find a diffeomorphic change of coordinate in R n and a diffeomorphic change of coordinate in R such that one member of the orbit is carried to any other. A function f is said to have a type A k -singularity if it lies in the orbit of       f   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =    1  +    ε  1    x  1  2    +  ⋯  +    ε   n  -  1     x   n  -  1   2     ±   x  n   k  +  1           f    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      plus-or-minus    1     subscript  ε  1    superscript   subscript  x  1   2    normal-⋯     subscript  ε    n  1     subscript   superscript  x  2     n  1       superscript   subscript  x  n     k  1       f(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})=1+\varepsilon_{1}x_{1}^{2}+\cdots+\varepsilon_{n-1}x^{2}%
 _{n-1}\pm x_{n}^{k+1}   where     ε  i   =   ±  1        subscript  ε  i    plus-or-minus  1     \varepsilon_{i}=\pm 1   and k ≥ 0 is an integer.  By a normal form we mean a particularly simple representative of any given orbit. The above expressions for f give normal forms for the type A k -singularities. The type A k -singularities are special because they are amongst the simple singularities, this means that there are only a finite number of other orbits in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of the orbit of f .  This idea extends over the complex numbers where the normal forms are much simpler; for example: there is no need to distinguish ε i = +1 from ε i = −1.
