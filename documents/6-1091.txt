   Drag count      Drag count   A drag count is dimensionless unit used by aerospace engineers where 1 drag count   ⇒   normal-⇒   \Rightarrow   a    C  d     subscript  C  d    C_{d}   of 0.0001. 1 2  Definition  A drag count    Δ    C  d        normal-Δ   subscript  C  normal-d     \Delta C_{\mathrm{d}}\,   is defined as:        Δ   C  d    =    10  4      2   F  d     ρ   v  2   A       ,        normal-Δ   subscript  C  normal-d       superscript  10  4       2   subscript  F  normal-d      ρ   superscript  v  2   A       \Delta C_{\mathrm{d}}=10^{4}\dfrac{2F_{\mathrm{d}}}{\rho v^{2}A}\,,     where:       F  d      subscript  F  normal-d    F_{\mathrm{d}}\,   is the drag force , which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity, 3      ρ    ρ   \rho\,   is the mass density of the fluid, 4      v    v   v\,   is the speed of the object relative to the fluid and      A    A   A\,   is the reference area .  The drag coefficient is used to compare the solutions of different geometries by means of a dimensionless number. A drag count is used as a more user-friendly measurement as the coefficient of drag is usually less than 1. A drag count of 200 to 400 is typical for an airplane at cruise. 5 A reduction of one drag count on a subsonic civil transport airplane means about 200 lbs more in payload. 6  References  See also   Drag coefficient  Zero-lift drag coefficient   "  Category:Aerodynamics  Category:Equations  Category:Fluid dynamics  Category:Force     T.
