Drag count

A drag count is dimensionless unit used by aerospace engineers where 1 drag count 
 
 
 
  a 
 
 
 
  of 0.0001.12
Definition
A drag count 
 
 
 
  is defined as:



where:


 
  is the drag force, which is by definition the force component in the direction of the flow velocity,3


 
  is the mass density of the fluid,4


 
  is the speed of the object relative to the fluid and


 
  is the reference area.
The drag coefficient is used to compare the solutions of different geometries by means of a dimensionless number. A drag count is used as a more user-friendly measurement as the coefficient of drag is usually less than 1. A drag count of 200 to 400 is typical for an airplane at cruise.5 A reduction of one drag count on a subsonic civil transport airplane means about 200 lbs more in payload.6
