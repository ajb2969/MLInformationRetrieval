   Gosper curve      Gosper curve   The Gosper curve , also known as Peano-Gosper Curve , 1 named after Bill Gosper , also known as the flowsnake (a spoonerism of snowflake ), is a space-filling curve . It is a fractal object similar in its construction to the dragon curve and the Hilbert curve .     (Figure)  Gosper curve 3.svg   (Figure)  Gosper curve 1.svg      A fourth-stage Gosper curve   The line from the red to the green point shows a single step of the Gosper curve construction.     Algorithm  Lindenmayer System  The Gosper curve can be represented using an L-System with rules as follows:   Angle: 60°  Axiom   A   A   A     Replacement rules:      A  ↦  A  -  B  -  -  B  +  A  +  +  A  A  +  B  -     fragments  A  maps-to  A   B    B   A    A  A   B     A\mapsto A-B--B+A++AA+B-         B  ↦  +  A  -  B  B  -  -  B  -  A  +  +  A  +  B     fragments  B  maps-to   A   B  B    B   A    A   B    B\mapsto+A-BB--B-A++A+B       In this case both A and B mean to move forward, + means to turn left 60 degrees and - means to turn right 60 degrees - using a "turtle"-style program such as Logo .  Logo  A Logo program to draw the Gosper curve using turtle graphics ( online version ): to rg :st :ln
  make "st :st - 1
  make "ln :ln / sqrt 7
  if :st > 0 [rg :st :ln rt 60 gl :st :ln  rt 120 gl :st :ln lt 60 rg :st :ln lt 120 rg :st :ln rg :st :ln lt 60 gl :st :ln rt 60]
  if :st = 0 [fd :ln rt 60 fd :ln rt 120 fd :ln lt 60 fd :ln lt 120 fd :ln fd :ln lt 60 fd :ln rt 60]
  end
  
  to gl :st :ln
  make "st :st - 1
  make "ln :ln / sqrt 7
  if :st > 0 [lt 60 rg :st :ln rt 60 gl :st :ln gl :st :ln rt 120 gl :st :ln rt 60 rg :st :ln lt 120 rg :st :ln lt 60 gl :st :ln]
  if :st = 0 [lt 60 fd :ln rt 60 fd :ln fd :ln rt 120 fd :ln rt 60 fd :ln lt 120 fd :ln lt 60 fd :ln]
  end  The program can be invoked, for example, with rg 4 300 , or alternatively gl 4 300 .  Properties  The space filled by the curve is called the Gosper island . The first few iterations of it are shown below:     (Figure)  Gosper Island 0.svg   (Figure)  Gosper Island 1.svg   (Figure)  Gosper Island 2.svg   (Figure)  Gosper Island 3.svg   (Figure)  Gosper Island 4.svg      The Gosper Island can tile the plane . In fact, seven copies of the Gosper island can be joined together to form a shape that is similar , but scaled up by a factor of √7 in all dimensions. As can be seen from the diagram below, performing this operation with an intermediate iteration of the island leads to a scaled-up version of the next iteration. Repeating this process indefinitely produces a tessellation of the plane. The curve itself can likewise be extended to an infinite curve filling the whole plane.
