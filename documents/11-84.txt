   Glutamate—tRNA ligase      Glutamate—tRNA ligase   In enzymology , a glutamate-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-glutamate + tRNAGlu   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-glutamyl-tRNAGlu   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-glutamate , and tRNA(Glu) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and L-glutamyl-tRNA(Glu) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:tRNAGlu ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include glutamyl-tRNA synthetase , glutamyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase , glutamyl-transfer RNA synthetase , glutamyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase , glutamate-tRNA synthetase , and glutamic acid translase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : glutamate metabolism , porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism , and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 16 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
