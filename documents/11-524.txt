Palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase




Palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase

In enzymology, a palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

palmitoyl-CoA + H2O 
 
 
 
  CoA + palmitate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are palmitoyl-CoA and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and palmitate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is palmitoyl-CoA hydrolase. Other names in common use include long-chain fatty-acyl-CoA hydrolase, palmitoyl coenzyme A hydrolase, palmitoyl thioesterase, palmitoyl coenzyme A hydrolase, palmitoyl-CoA deacylase, palmityl thioesterase, palmityl-CoA deacylase, fatty acyl thioesterase I, and palmityl thioesterase I.
