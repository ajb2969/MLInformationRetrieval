   N-acetylgalactosaminyl-proteoglycan 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase      N-acetylgalactosaminyl-proteoglycan 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase   In enzymology , a N-acetylgalactosaminyl-proteoglycan 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate + N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucuronosyl- proteoglycan   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)- beta-D-glucuronosyl-proteoglycan   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are UDP-alpha-D-glucuronate , N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucuronosyl- , and proteoglycan , whereas its 3 products are UDP , beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)- , and beta-D-glucuronosyl-proteoglycan .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-D-glucuronate:N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glu curonosyl-proteoglycan 3-beta-glucuronosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called chondroitin glucuronyltransferase II . This enzyme participates in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 .
