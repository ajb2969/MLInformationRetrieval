   Whitney extension theorem      Whitney extension theorem   In mathematics , in particular in mathematical analysis , the Whitney extension theorem is a partial converse to Taylor's theorem . Roughly speaking, the theorem asserts that if A is a closed subset of a Euclidean space, then it is possible to extend a given function of A in such a way as to have prescribed derivatives at the points of A . It is a result of Hassler Whitney . A related result is due to McShane, hence it is sometimes called the McShane‚ÄìWhitney extension theorem.  Statement  A precise statement of the theorem requires careful consideration of what it means to prescribe the derivative of a function on a closed set. One difficulty, for instance, is that closed subsets of Euclidean space in general lack a differentiable structure. The starting point, then, is an examination of the statement of Taylor's theorem.  Given a real-valued C m function f ( x ) on R n , Taylor's theorem asserts that for each a , x , y ‚àà R n , there is a function R Œ± ( x , y ) approaching 0 uniformly as x , y ‚Üí a such that  where the sum is over multi-indices  Œ± .  Let f Œ± = D Œ± f for each multi-index Œ± . Differentiating (1) with respect to x , and possibly replacing R as needed, yields  where R Œ± is o (| x ‚àí y | m ‚àí| Œ± | ) uniformly as x , y ‚Üí a .  Note that () may be regarded as purely a compatibility condition between the functions f Œ± which must be satisfied in order for these functions to be the coefficients of the Taylor series of the function f . It is this insight which facilitates the following statement  Theorem. Suppose that f Œ± are a collection of functions on a closed subset A of R n for all multi-indices Œ± with     |  Œ±  |   ‚â§  m        Œ±   m    |\alpha|\leq m   satisfying the compatibility condition () at all points x , y , and a of A . Then there exists a function F ( x ) of class C m such that:   F = f 0 on A .  D Œ± F = f Œ± on A .  F is real-analytic at every point of R n ‚àí A .   Proofs are given in the original paper of , and in ,  and .  Extension in a half space  proved a sharpening of the Whitney extension theorem in the special case of a half space. A smooth function on a half space R n ,+ of points where x n ‚â• 0 is a smooth function f on the interior x n for which the derivatives ‚àÇ Œ±  f extend to continuous functions on the half space. On the boundary x n = 0, f restricts to smooth function. By Borel's lemma can be extended to a smooth function on the whole of R n . Since Borel's lemma is local in nature, the same argument shows that if Œ© is a (bounded or unbounded) domain in R n with smooth boundary, then any smooth function on the closure of Œ© can be extended to a smooth function on R n .  Seeley's result for a half line gives a uniform extension map       E  :     C  ‚àû    (   ùêë  +   )    ‚Üí    C  ‚àû    (  ùêë  )      ,     normal-:  E   normal-‚Üí     superscript  C     superscript  ùêë        superscript  C    ùêë      \displaystyle{E:C^{\infty}(\mathbf{R}^{+})\rightarrow C^{\infty}(\mathbf{R}),}     which is linear, continuous (for the topology of uniform convergence of functions and their derivatives on compacta) and takes functions supported in [0, R ] into functions supported in [‚àí R , R ]  To define E , set 1      E   (  f  )    (  x  )   =   ‚àë   m  =  1   ‚àû    a  m   f   (  -   b  m   x  )   œÜ   (  -   b  m   x  )    (  x  <  0  )   ,     fragments  E   fragments  normal-(  f  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     superscript   subscript     m  1       subscript  a  m   f   fragments  normal-(    subscript  b  m   x  normal-)   œÜ   fragments  normal-(    subscript  b  m   x  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  x   0  normal-)   normal-,    \displaystyle{E(f)(x)=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}a_{m}f(-b_{m}x)\varphi(-b_{m}x)\,\,\,%
 (x<0),}     where œÜ is a smooth function of compact support on R equal to 1 near 0 and the sequences ( a m ), ( b m ) satisfy:   b m > 0 tends to ‚àû;  ‚àë a m  b m j = (‚àí1) j for j ‚â• 0 with the sum absolutely convergent.   A solution to this system of equations can be obtained by taking b n = 2 n and seeking an entire function       g   (  z  )    =    ‚àë   m  =  1   ‚àû     a  m    z  m           g  z     superscript   subscript     m  1         subscript  a  m    superscript  z  m       g(z)=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}a_{m}z^{m}     such that g (2 j ) = (‚àí1) j . That such a function can be constructed follows from the Weierstrass theorem and Mittag-Leffler theorem . 2  It can be seen directly by setting 3        W   (  z  )    =    ‚àè   j  ‚â•  1     (   1  -   z  /   2  j     )     ,        W  z     subscript  product    j  1      1    z   superscript  2  j        W(z)=\prod_{j\geq 1}(1-z/2^{j}),     an entire function with simple zeros at 2 j . The derivatives W '(2 j ) are bounded above and below. Similarly the function        M   (  z  )    =    ‚àë   j  ‚â•  1      (   -  1   )   j       W  ‚Ä≤    (   2  j   )    (   z  -   2  j    )            M  z     subscript     j  1     superscript    1   j        superscript  W  normal-‚Ä≤    superscript  2  j     z   superscript  2  j       M(z)=\sum_{j\geq 1}(-1)^{j}\over W^{\prime}(2^{j})(z-2^{j})     meromorphic with simple poles and prescribed residues at 2 j .  By construction       g   (  z  )    =   W   (  z  )   M   (  z  )          g  z     W  z  M  z     \displaystyle{g(z)=W(z)M(z)}     is an entire function with the required properties.  The definition for a half space in R n by applying the operator R to the last variable x n . Similarly, using a smooth partition of unity and a local change of variables, the result for a half space implies the existence of an analogous extending map        C  ‚àû    (   Œ©  ¬Ø   )    ‚Üí    C  ‚àû    (   ùêë  n   )       normal-‚Üí     superscript  C     normal-¬Ø  normal-Œ©       superscript  C     superscript  ùêë  n      \displaystyle{C^{\infty}(\overline{\Omega})\rightarrow C^{\infty}(\mathbf{R}^{%
