   Uniform algebra      Uniform algebra   A uniform algebra  A on a compact  Hausdorff  topological space  X is a closed (with respect to the uniform norm ) subalgebra of the C*-algebra  C(X) (the continuous complex valued functions on X ) with the following properties:   the constant functions are contained in A   for every x , y    ∈     \in    X there is f   ∈     \in    A with f(x)   ≠     \neq   f(y). This is called separating the points of X .   As a closed subalgebra of the commutative  Banach algebra  C(X) a uniform algebra is itself a unital commutative Banach algebra (when equipped with the uniform norm). Hence, it is, (by definition) a Banach function algebra .  A uniform algebra A on X is said to be natural if the maximal ideals of A precisely are the ideals    M  x     subscript  M  x    M_{x}   of functions vanishing at a point x in X .  Abstract characterization  If A is a unital  commutative  Banach algebra such that     ||   a  2   ||   =    ||  a  ||   2        norm   superscript  a  2     superscript   norm  a   2     ||a^{2}||=||a||^{2}   for all a in A , then there is a compact  Hausdorff  X such that A is isomorphic as a Banach algebra to a uniform algebra on X . This result follows from the spectral radius formula and the Gelfand representation.  "  Category:Functional analysis  Category:Banach algebras
