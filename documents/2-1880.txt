   Radix point      Radix point   In mathematics and computing , a radix point (or radix character ) is the symbol used in numerical representations to separate the integer part of a number (to the left of the radix point) from its fractional part (to the right of the radix point). 1 "Radix point" is a general term that applies to all number bases . In base 10 notation, the radix point is more commonly called the decimal point , where the prefix deci- implies base 10. Similarly, the term "binary point" is used for base 2 .  In English-speaking countries , the radix point is usually a small dot, . , placed either on the baseline or halfway between the baseline and the top of the numerals . In many other countries the radix point is a comma (,) placed on the baseline. It is important to know which notation is being used when working in different software programs.  Examples   In base 10 (decimal): 13.625    In this example, 13 is the integer to the left of the radix point, and 625 (i.e. 625/1000) is the fractional part to the right.    In base 2 (binary): 1101.101    The binary number 1101.101 has the following digits:       Power of 2   3   2   1   0    −1   −2   −3       Binary digit   1   1   0   1   .   1   0   1     Hence, its decimal value can be calculated as:      1101.101  2     subscript  1101.101  2    \displaystyle 1101.101_{2}     It is now seen that 1101, which is to the left of the radix point, is the binary representation of the decimal number 13. To the right of the radix point is 101, which is the binary representation of the decimal fraction 625/1000 (or 5/8).
