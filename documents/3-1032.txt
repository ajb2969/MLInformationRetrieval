   Conjugate element (field theory)      Conjugate element (field theory)   In mathematics , in particular field theory , the conjugate elements of an algebraic element α, over a field extension  L/K , are the roots of the minimal polynomial  p K ,α ( x ) of α over K . Conjugate elements are also called Galois conjugates , or simply conjugates . Normally α itself is included in the set of conjugates of α.  Example  The cube roots of the number one are:       1  3   =   {     1         -    1  2     +      3   2    i           -    1  2     -      3   2    i                3   1    cases  1  otherwise        1  2          3   2   i    otherwise        1  2          3   2   i    otherwise     \sqrt[3]{1}=\begin{cases}\ \ 1\\
 -\frac{1}{2}+\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\\
 -\frac{1}{2}-\frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}i\end{cases}     The latter two roots are conjugate elements in L / K = Q [√3, i ]/ Q [√3] with minimal polynomial         (   x  +   1  2    )   2   +   3  4    =    x  2   +  x  +  1.          superscript    x    1  2    2     3  4       superscript  x  2   x  1.     \left(x+\frac{1}{2}\right)^{2}+\frac{3}{4}=x^{2}+x+1.     Properties  If K is given inside an algebraically closed field  C , then the conjugates can be taken inside C . If no such C is specified, one can take the conjugates in some relatively small field L . The smallest possible choice for L is to take a splitting field over K of p K ,α , containing α. If L is any normal extension of K containing α, then by definition it already contains such a splitting field.  Given then a normal extension L of K , with automorphism group Aut( L / K ) = G , and containing α, any element g (α) for g in G will be a conjugate of α, since the automorphism  g sends roots of p to roots of p . Conversely any conjugate β of α is of this form: in other words, G acts transitively on the conjugates. This follows as K (α) is K -isomorphic to K (β) by irreducibility of the minimal polynomial, and any isomorphism of fields F and F{{'}} that maps polynomial p to p{{'}} can be extended to an isomorphism of the splitting fields of p over F and p{{'}} over F{{'}} , respectively.  In summary, the conjugate elements of α are found, in any normal extension L of K that contains K (α), as the set of elements g (α) for g in Aut( L / K ). The number of repeats in that list of each element is the separable degree [ L : K (α)] sep .  A theorem of Kronecker states that if α is a nonzero algebraic integer such that α and all of its conjugates in the complex numbers have absolute value at most 1, then α is a root of unity . There are quantitative forms of this, stating more precisely bounds (depending on degree) on the largest absolute value of a conjugate that imply that an algebraic integer is a root of unity.
