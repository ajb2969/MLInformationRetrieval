   N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate synthase      N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate synthase   N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate synthase (, neuB (gene) , legI (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name phosphenolpyruvate:2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-mannopyranose 1-(2-carboxy-2-oxoethyl)transferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2,4-diacetamido-2,4,6-trideoxy-alpha-D-mannopyranose + phosphenolpyruvate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N,N'-diacetyllegionaminate + phosphate    This enzyme requires a divalent metal such as Mn 2+ .
