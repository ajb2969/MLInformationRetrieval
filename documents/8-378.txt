   Lax pair      Lax pair   In mathematics , in the theory of integrable systems , a Lax pair is a pair of time-dependent matrices or operators that satisfy a corresponding differential equation , called the Lax equation . Lax pairs were introduced by Peter Lax to discuss solitons in continuous media . The inverse scattering transform makes use of the Lax equations to solve such systems.  Definition  A Lax pair is a pair of matrices or operators $L(t), P(t)$ dependent on time and acting on a fixed Hilbert space , and satisfying Lax's equation :  $$\frac{dL}{dt}=[P,L]$$  where $[P,L]=PL-LP$ is the commutator . Often, as in the example below, $P$ depends on $L$ in a prescribed way, so this is a nonlinear equation for $L$ as a function of $t$ .  Isospectral property  It can then be shown that the eigenvalues and more generally the spectrum of L are independent of t . The matrices/operators L are said to be isospectral as $t$ varies.  The core observation is that the matrices $L(t)$ are all similar by virtue of  $$L(t)=U(t,s) L(s) U(t,s)^{-1}$$  where $U(t,s)$ is the solution of the Cauchy problem  $$\frac{d}{dt} U(t,s) = P(t) U(t,s), \qquad U(s,s) = I,$$  where I denotes the identity matrix. Note that if L(t) is self-adjoint and P(t) is skew-adjoint , then U(t,s) will be unitary .  In other words, to solve the eigenvalue problem Lψ = λψ at time t , it is possible to solve the same problem at time 0 where L is generally known better, and to propagate the solution with the following formulas:  $$\lambda(t)=\lambda(0)$$ (no change in spectrum)  $$\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}=P \psi.$$  Link with the inverse scattering method  The above property is the basis for the inverse scattering method. In this method, L and P act on a functional space (thus ψ = ψ(t,x) ), and depend on an unknown function u(t,x) which is to be determined. It is generally assumed that u(0,x) is known, and that P does not depend on u in the scattering region where $\Vert x \Vert\to \infty$ . The method then takes the following form:   Compute the spectrum of $L(0)$ , giving $\lambda$ and $\psi(0,x)$ ,  In the scattering region where $P$ is known, propagate $\psi$ in time by using $\frac{\partial \psi}{\partial t}(t,x)=P \psi(t,x)$ with initial condition $\psi(0,x)$ ,  Knowing $\psi$ in the scattering region, compute $L(t)$ and/or $u(t,x)$ .   Example  The Korteweg–de Vries equation is  $$u_t=6uu_x-u_{xxx}.\,$$ It can be reformulated as the Lax equation  $$L_t=[P,L]\,$$ with  $$L=-\partial_{x}^2+u\,$$ (a Sturm–Liouville operator )  $$P= -4\partial_{x}^3+3(u\partial_{x}+\partial_{x} u)\,$$ where all derivatives act on all objects to the right. This accounts for the infinite number of first integrals of the KdV equation.
