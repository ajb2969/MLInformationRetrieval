   Popoviciu's inequality on variances      Popoviciu's inequality on variances   In probability theory , Popoviciu's inequality , named after Tiberiu Popoviciu , is an upper bound on the variance of any bounded probability distribution . Let M and m be upper and lower bounds on the values of any random variable with a particular probability distribution. Then Popoviciu's inequality states: 1       variance  ≤    1  4     (   M  -  m   )   2     .      variance      1  4    superscript    M  m   2      \text{variance}\leq\frac{1}{4}(M-m)^{2}.   Sharma et al. have proved an improvement of the Popoviciu's inequality that says that: 2        variance  +    (      T  h  i  r  d  c  e  n  t  r  a  l  m  o  m  e  n  t    2 variance   )   2    ≤    1  4     (   M  -  m   )   2     .        variance   superscript         T  h  i  r  d  c  e  n  t  r  a  l  m  o  m  e  n  t    2 variance   2        1  4    superscript    M  m   2      {\text{variance}+(\frac{\text{}}{Thirdcentralmoment}\text{2 variance})^{2}}%
 \leq\frac{1}{4}(M-m)^{2}.     Equality holds precisely when half of the probability is concentrated at each of the two bounds.  Popoviciu's inequality is weaker than the Bhatia–Davis inequality .
