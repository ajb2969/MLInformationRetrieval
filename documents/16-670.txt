   Snaith's theorem      Snaith's theorem   In algebraic topology , a branch of mathematics , Snaith's theorem , introduced by Victor Snaith , identifies the complex K-theory  spectrum with the localization of the suspension spectrum of    ℂ   P  ∞       ℂ   superscript  P      \mathbb{C}P^{\infty}   away from the Bott element .
