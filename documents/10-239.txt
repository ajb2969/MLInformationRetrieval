   GABA transaminase      GABA transaminase   A GABA transaminase is an enzyme that catalyzes chemical reactions. There are two types of this enzyme:   4-aminobutyrate transaminase , which catalyzes the chemical reaction :  4-aminobutanoate + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate semialdehyde + L-glutamate    and   4-aminobutyrate—pyruvate transaminase , which catalyzes the chemical reaction:  (1) 4-aminobutanoate + pyruvate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    succinate semialdehyde + L- alanine   (2) 4-aminobutanoate + glyoxylate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate semialdehyde + glycine     GABA transaminase is targeted by multiple antiepileptic and analgesic drugs referred to as GABA transaminase inhibitors .
