   Exponential sheaf sequence      Exponential sheaf sequence   In mathematics , the exponential sheaf sequence is a fundamental short exact sequence of sheaves used in complex geometry .  Let M be a complex manifold , and write O M for the sheaf of holomorphic functions on M . Let O M * be the subsheaf consisting of the non-vanishing holomorphic functions. These are both sheaves of abelian groups . The exponential function gives a sheaf homomorphism       exp  :    𝒪  M   →   𝒪  M  *     ,     normal-:    normal-→   subscript  𝒪  M    superscript   subscript  𝒪  M        \exp:\mathcal{O}_{M}\to\mathcal{O}_{M}^{*},     because for a holomorphic function f , exp( f ) is a non-vanishing holomorphic function, and exp( f + g ) = exp( f )exp( g ). Its kernel is the sheaf 2π i Z of locally constant functions on M taking the values 2π in , with n an integer . The exponential sheaf sequence is therefore      0  →   2  π   i   ℤ   →   𝒪  M   →   𝒪  M  *   →  0.       normal-→  0    2  π  i  ℤ     normal-→     subscript  𝒪  M     normal-→     superscript   subscript  𝒪  M       normal-→    0.     0\to 2\pi i\,\mathbb{Z}\to\mathcal{O}_{M}\to\mathcal{O}_{M}^{*}\to 0.     The exponential mapping here is not always a surjective map on sections; this can be seen for example when M is a punctured disk in the complex plane. The exponential map is surjective on the stalks : Given a germ  g of an holomorphic function at a point P such that g ( P ) ≠ 0, one can take the logarithm of g in a neighborhood of P . The long exact sequence of sheaf cohomology shows that we have an exact sequence      ⋯  →    H  0    (   𝒪  U   )    →    H  0    (   𝒪  U  *   )    →    H  1    (     2  π   i   ℤ   |   U   )    →  ⋯       normal-→  normal-⋯     superscript  H  0    subscript  𝒪  U      normal-→       superscript  H  0    superscript   subscript  𝒪  U        normal-→       superscript  H  1    evaluated-at    2  π  i  ℤ   U      normal-→    normal-⋯     \cdots\to H^{0}(\mathcal{O}_{U})\to H^{0}(\mathcal{O}_{U}^{*})\to H^{1}(2\pi i%
 \,\mathbb{Z}|_{U})\to\cdots     for any open set U of M . Here H 0 means simply the sections over U , and the sheaf cohomology H 1 (2π i Z | U ) is the singular cohomology of U . The connecting homomorphism is therefore a generalized winding number and measures the failure of U to be contractible . In other words, there is a potential topological obstruction to taking a global logarithm of a non-vanishing holomorphic function, something that is always locally possible.  A further consequence of the sequence is the exactness of       ⋯  →    H  1    (   𝒪  M   )    →    H  1    (   𝒪  M  *   )    →    H  2    (   2  π   i   ℤ   )    →  ⋯   .       normal-→  normal-⋯     superscript  H  1    subscript  𝒪  M      normal-→       superscript  H  1    superscript   subscript  𝒪  M        normal-→       superscript  H  2     2  π  i  ℤ      normal-→    normal-⋯     \cdots\to H^{1}(\mathcal{O}_{M})\to H^{1}(\mathcal{O}_{M}^{*})\to H^{2}(2\pi i%
 \,\mathbb{Z})\to\cdots.     Here H 1 ( O M *) can be identified with the Picard group of holomorphic line bundles on M . The connecting homomorphism sends a line bundle to its first Chern class .
