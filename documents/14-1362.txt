   Mehler–Heine formula      Mehler–Heine formula   In mathematics, the Mehler–Heine formula introduced by  and  describes the asymptotic behavior of the Legendre polynomials as the index tends to infinity, near the edges of the support of the weight. There are generalizations to other classical orthogonal polynomials , which are also called the Mehler–Heine formula. The formula complements the Darboux formulae which describe the asymptotics in the interior and outside the support.  Legendre polynomials  The simplest case of the Mehler–Heine formula states that        lim   n  →  ∞      P  n    (   cos   z  n    )     =    J  0    (  z  )          subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  P  n       z  n         subscript  J  0   z     \lim_{n\to\infty}P_{n}\Bigl(\cos{z\over n}\Bigr)=J_{0}(z)     where P n is the Legendre polynomial of order n , and J 0 a Bessel function . The limit is uniform over z in an arbitrary bounded domain in the complex plane .  Jacobi polynomials  The generalization to Jacobi polynomials  P is given by  as follows:         lim   n  →  ∞      n   -  α     P  n   α  ,  β     (   cos   z  n    )     =     (   z  2   )    -  α     J  α    (  z  )     .        subscript    normal-→  n        superscript  n    α     superscript   subscript  P  n    α  β        z  n         superscript    z  2     α     subscript  J  α   z     \lim_{n\to\infty}n^{-\alpha}P_{n}^{\alpha,\beta}\left(\cos\frac{z}{n}\right)=%
