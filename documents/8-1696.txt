Generalized linear array model

In statistics, the generalized linear array model (GLAM) is used for analyzing data sets with array structures. It based on the generalized linear model with the design matrix written as a Kronecker product.
Overview
The generalized linear array model or GLAM was introduced in 2006.1 Such models provide a structure and a computational procedure for fitting generalized linear models or GLMs whose model matrix can be written as a Kronecker product and whose data can be written as an array. In a large GLM, the GLAM approach gives very substantial savings in both storage and computational time over the usual GLM algorithm.
Suppose that the data 
 
 
 
  is arranged in a 
 
 
 
 -dimensional array with size 
 
 
 
 ; thus,the corresponding data vector 
 
 
 
  has size 
 
 
 
 . Suppose also that the design matrix is of the form



The standard analysis of a GLM with data vector 
 
 
 
  and design matrix 
 
 
 
  proceeds by repeated evaluation of the scoring algorithm



where 
 
 
 
  represents the approximate solution of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the improved value of it; 
 
 
 
  is the diagonal weight matrix with elements



and


 
  is the working variable.
Computationally, GLAM provides array algorithms to calculate the linear predictor,


 
  and the weighted inner product


 
  without evaluation of the model matrix 
 
 

Example
In 2 dimensions, let 
 
 
 
  then the linear predictor is written 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the matrix of coefficients; the weighted inner product is obtained from 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the matrix of weights; here 
 
 
 
  is the row tensor function of the 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
  given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  means element by element multiplication and 
 
 
 
  is a vector of 1's of length 
 
 
 
 .
These low storage high speed formulae extend to 
 
 
 
 -dimensions.
Applications
GLAM is designed to be used in 
 
 
 
 -dimensional smoothing problems where the data are arranged in an array and the smoothing matrix is constructed as a Kronecker product of 
 
 
 
  one-dimensional smoothing matrices.
