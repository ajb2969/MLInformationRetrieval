The alternative reading ακολουθησουσιν occur in the manuscripts A , B , D , Δ , 700 , and other. 7  In John 10:6 it has singular reading τι ην α for τι; the reading of the codex is not supported by any other manuscript. 8 9  In John 10:10 it has unique addition: δ]ε (between ο and κλεπτης) – ο δε κλεπτης instead of ο κλεπτης. 10  In John 11:1 it reads ην δε τις εκει for ην δε τις; the reading of the codex is not supported by any other manuscript. 11  In John 11:2 name Mariam has an unusual spelling with using Coptic letters (Mariham). 12  In John 11:5 it has singular reading της μαρθαν και την αδελφεν αυτης. 13  In John 11:45 it has reading οι ελθοντες προς την Μαριαμ along with the manuscripts Papyrus 59 , Vaticanus, Ephraemi, Regius, minuscule 33 ; other manuscripts read οι ελθοντες μετα Μαριαμ. 14  History  Caspar René Gregory did not try to estimate its date. 15 16 Friedrich Rösch suggested the 5th or 6th century, according to him the earlier date of the codex is excluded by presence 1 Epistle of Clement. 17 Some scholars date it even so late as 7th-8th century. 18 Currently it is dated by the INTF to the 4th century. 19 It is difficult to date the manuscript on the palaeographical ground because of its fragmentary nature.  The manuscript was discovered in Egypt. It was the second manuscript with translation 1 Epistle of Clement into Coptic and the first in Akhmimic dialect. The Greek text of the codex was published by Gregory in 1908. Friedrich Rösch published the text of the whole manuscript Coptic and Greek in 1910.  It is currently housed at the Bibliothèque nationale et universitaire (Pap. copt. 379. 381. 382. 384) in Strasbourg . 20 21  See also   List of New Testament papyri  Coptic versions of the Bible   References   Wolfgang Kosack , Novum Testamentum Coptice.
