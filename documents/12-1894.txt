   Sphere spectrum      Sphere spectrum   In stable homotopy theory , a branch of mathematics , the sphere spectrum  S is the smallest nontrivial spectrum . It is the suspension spectrum of S 0 , i.e., a set of two points. Explicitly, the n th space in the sphere spectrum is the n -dimensional sphere  S n , and the structure maps from the suspension of S n to S n +1 are the canonical homeomorphisms . The k -th homotopy group of a sphere spectrum is the k -th stable homotopy group of spheres.  The localization of the sphere spectrum at a prime number p is called the local sphere at p and is denoted by    S   (  p  )      subscript  S  p    S_{(p)}   .
