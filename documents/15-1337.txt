   Trans-resveratrol di-O-methyltransferase      Trans-resveratrol di-O-methyltransferase   Trans-resveratrol di-O-methyltransferase (, ROMT , resveratrol O-methyltransferase , pterostilbene synthase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:trans-resveratrol 3,5-O-dimethyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + trans- resveratrol    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + pterostilbene (overall reaction)  (1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + trans-resveratrol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3-methoxy-4',5-dihydroxy-trans-stilbene  (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3-methoxy-4',5-dihydroxy-trans-stilbene   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + pterostilbene   The enzyme catalyses the biosynthesis of pterostilbene from resveratrol.
