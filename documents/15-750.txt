Spitzer's formula

In probability theory, Spitzer's formula or Spitzer's identity gives the joint distribution of partial sums and maximal partial sums of a collection of random variables. The result was first published by Frank Spitzer in 1956.1 The formula is regarded as "a stepping stone in the theory of sums of independent random variables".2
Statement of theorem
Let X1, X2, ... be independent and identically distributed random variables and define the partial sums Sn = X1 + X2 + ... + Xn. Define Rn = max(0,S1,S2,...,Sn). Then3








where






\phi_n(\alpha,\beta) &= \operatorname E(\exp\left[ i(\alpha R_n + \beta(R_n-S_n)\right])\\ u_n(\alpha) &= \operatorname E(\exp \left[i\alpha S_n^+\right]) \\ v_n(\beta) &= \operatorname E(\exp \left[i \beta S_n^-\right]) \end{align}
and S± denotes (|S| ± S)/2.
Proof
Two proofs are known, due to Spitzer4 and Wendel.5
