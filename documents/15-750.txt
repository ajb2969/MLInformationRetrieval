   Spitzer's formula      Spitzer's formula   In probability theory , Spitzer's formula or Spitzer's identity gives the joint distribution of partial sums and maximal partial sums of a collection of random variables. The result was first published by Frank Spitzer in 1956. 1 The formula is regarded as "a stepping stone in the theory of sums of independent random variables". 2  Statement of theorem  Let X 1 , X 2 , ... be independent and identically distributed random variables and define the partial sums S n = X 1 + X 2 + ... + X n . Define R n = max(0, S 1 , S 2 ,..., S n ). Then 3          ∑   n  =  0   ∞     ϕ  n    (  α  ,  β  )    t  n     =   exp   [    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      t  n   n    (      u  n    (  α  )    +    v  n    (  β  )     -  1   )     ]          superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  ϕ  n    α  β    superscript  t  n         superscript   subscript     n  1           superscript  t  n   n          subscript  u  n   α      subscript  v  n   β    1        \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\phi_{n}(\alpha,\beta)t^{n}=\exp\left[\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}%
 \frac{t^{n}}{n}\left(u_{n}(\alpha)+v_{n}(\beta)-1\right)\right]        where    \begin{align}     \phi_n(\alpha,\beta) &= \operatorname E(\exp\left[ i(\alpha R_n + \beta(R_n-S_n)\right])\\ u_n(\alpha) &= \operatorname E(\exp \left[i\alpha S_n^+\right]) \\ v_n(\beta) &= \operatorname E(\exp \left[i \beta S_n^-\right]) \end{align}  and S ± denotes (| S | ± S )/2.  Proof  Two proofs are known, due to Spitzer 4 and Wendel. 5  References  "  Category:Stochastic processes  Category:Probability theorems     ↩  ↩    ↩
