Sparse matrix-vector multiplication

Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) of the form 
 
 
 
  is a widely used computational kernel existing in many scientific applications. The input matrix 
 
 
 
 
  is sparse. The input vector 
 
 
 
  and the output vector 
 
 
 
  are dense. In case of repeated 
 
 
 
  operation involving the same input matrix 
 
 
 
  but possibly changing numerical values of its elements, 
 
 
 
 
  can be preprocessed to reduce both the parallel and sequential run time of the SpMV kernel.1
