   Sparse matrix-vector multiplication      Sparse matrix-vector multiplication   Sparse matrix-vector multiplication (SpMV) of the form    y  =   A  x       y    A  x     y=Ax   is a widely used computational kernel existing in many scientific applications. The input matrix   A   A   A   is sparse . The input vector   x   x   x   and the output vector   y   y   y   are dense. In case of repeated    y  =   A  x       y    A  x     y=Ax   operation involving the same input matrix   A   A   A   but possibly changing numerical values of its elements,   A   A   A   can be preprocessed to reduce both the parallel and sequential run time of the SpMV kernel. 1  References  "  Category:Sparse matrices     â†©
