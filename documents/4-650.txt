   Hurwitz quaternion      Hurwitz quaternion   In mathematics , a Hurwitz quaternion (or Hurwitz integer ) is a quaternion whose components are either all integers  or all half-integers (halves of an odd integer; a mixture of integers and half-integers is excluded). The set of all Hurwitz quaternions is       H  =   {    a  +   b  i   +   c  j   +   d  k    ∈  ℍ   ∣     a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d   ∈    ℤ    or   a    ,    b  ,  c  ,  d   ∈   ℤ  +    1  2       }    .      H   conditional-set      a    b  i     c  j     d  k    ℍ    formulae-sequence     a  b  c  d     ℤ  or  a       b  c  d     ℤ    1  2         H=\left\{a+bi+cj+dk\in\mathbb{H}\mid a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}\;\mbox{ or }\,a,b,c,%
 d\in\mathbb{Z}+\tfrac{1}{2}\right\}.     H is closed under quaternion multiplication and addition, which makes it a subring of the ring of all quaternions H . Hurwitz quaternions were introduced by .  A Lipschitz quaternion (or Lipschitz integer ) is a quaternion whose components are all integers . The set of all Lipschitz quaternions      L  =   {    a  +   b  i   +   c  j   +   d  k    ∈  ℍ   ∣    a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d   ∈  ℤ   }       L   conditional-set      a    b  i     c  j     d  k    ℍ      a  b  c  d   ℤ      L=\left\{a+bi+cj+dk\in\mathbb{H}\mid a,b,c,d\in\mathbb{Z}\right\}     forms a subring of the Hurwitz quaternions H .  Structure of the ring of Hurwitz quaternions  As a group , H is free abelian with generators  It therefore forms a lattice in R 4 . This lattice is known as the F 4 lattice since it is the root lattice of the semisimple Lie algebra  F 4 . The Lipschitz quaternions L form an index 2 sublattice of H .  The group of units in L is the order 8 quaternion group The group of units in H is a nonabelian group of order 24 known as the binary tetrahedral group . The elements of this group include the 8 elements of Q along with the 16 quaternions  where signs may be taken in any combination. The quaternion group is a normal subgroup of the binary tetrahedral group U( H ). The elements of U( H ), which all have norm 1, form the vertices of the 24-cell inscribed in the 3-sphere .  The Hurwitz quaternions form an order (in the sense of ring theory ) in the division ring of quaternions with rational components. It is in fact a maximal order ; this accounts for its importance. The Lipschitz quaternions, which are the more obvious candidate for the idea of an integral quaternion , also form an order. However, this latter order is not a maximal one, and therefore (as it turns out) less suitable for developing a theory of left ideals comparable to that of algebraic number theory . What Adolf Hurwitz realised, therefore, was that this definition of Hurwitz integral quaternion is the better one to operate with. For a non-commutative ring such as H , maximal orders need not be unique, so one needs to fix a maximal order, in carrying over the concept of an algebraic integer .  The lattice of Hurwitz quaternions  The (arithmetic, or field) norm of a Hurwitz quaternion, given by     a  2   +   b  2   +   c  2   +   d  2        superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2    superscript  d  2     a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}+d^{2}   , is always an integer. By a theorem of Lagrange every nonnegative integer can be written as a sum of at most four squares . Thus, every nonnegative integer is the norm of some Lipschitz (or Hurwitz) quaternion. More precisely, the number c ( n ) of Hurwitz quaternions of given positive norm n is 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of n . The generating function of the numbers c ( n ) is given by the level 2 weight 2 modular form        2   E  2    (   2  τ   )    -    E  2    (  τ  )     =    ∑  n    c   (  n  )    q  n     =   1  +   24  q   +   24   q  2    +   96   q  3    +   24   q  4    +   144   q  5    +  ⋯             2   subscript  E  2     2  τ       subscript  E  2   τ      subscript   n     c  n   superscript  q  n            1    24  q     24   superscript  q  2      96   superscript  q  3      24   superscript  q  4      144   superscript  q  5    normal-⋯      2E_{2}(2\tau)-E_{2}(\tau)=\sum_{n}c(n)q^{n}=1+24q+24q^{2}+96q^{3}+24q^{4}+144q%
 ^{5}+\cdots   where      q  =   e   2  π  i  τ        q   superscript  e    2  π  i  τ      q=e^{2\pi i\tau}   and        E  2    (  τ  )    =   1  -   24    ∑  n     σ  1    (  n  )    q  n              subscript  E  2   τ     1    24    subscript   n      subscript  σ  1   n   superscript  q  n         E_{2}(\tau)=1-24\sum_{n}\sigma_{1}(n)q^{n}   is the weight 2 level 1 Eisenstein series (which is a quasimodular form ) and σ 1 ( n ) is the sum of the divisors of n .  Factorization into irreducible elements  A Hurwitz integer is called irreducible if it is not 0 or a unit and is not a product of non-units. A Hurwitz integer is irreducible if and only if its norm is a prime number . The irreducible quaternions are sometimes called prime quaternions, but this can be misleading as they are not primes in the usual sense of commutative algebra: it is possible for an irreducible quaternion to divide a product ab without dividing either a or b . Every Hurwitz quaternion can be factored as a product of irreducible quaternions. This factorization is not in general unique, even up to units and order, because a positive odd prime p can be written in 24( p +1) ways as a product of two irreducible Hurwitz quaternions of norm p , and for large p these cannot all be equivalent under left and right multiplication by units as there are only 24 units. However if one excludes this case then there is a version of unique factorization. More precisely, every Hurwitz quaternion can be written uniquely as the product of a positive integer and a primitive quaternion (a Hurwitz quaternion not divisible by any integer greater than 1). The factorization of a primitive quaternion into irreducibles is unique up to order and units in the following sense: if   p 0 p 1 ... p n    and   q 0 q 1 ... q n    are two factorizations of some Hurwitz quaternion into irreducible quaternions where p k has the same norm as q k for all k , then   q 0 = p 0 u 1   q 1 = u p 1 u 2   ...  q n = u p n    for some units u k .
