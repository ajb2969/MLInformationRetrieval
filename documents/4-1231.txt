   Elementary equivalence      Elementary equivalence   In model theory , a branch of mathematical logic , two structures  M and N of the same signature σ are called elementarily equivalent if they satisfy the same first-order  σ-sentences .  If N is a substructure of M , one often needs a stronger condition. In this case N is called an elementary substructure of M if every first-order σ-formula φ( a 1 , …, a n ) with parameters a 1 , …, a n from N is true in N if and only if it is true in M . If N is an elementary substructure of M , M is called an elementary extension of N . An embedding  h : N → M is called an elementary embedding of N into M if h ( N ) is an elementary substructure of M .  A substructure  N of M is elementary if and only if it passes the Tarski–Vaught test : every first-order formula φ( x , b 1 , …, b n ) with parameters in N that has a solution in M also has a solution in N when evaluated in M . One can prove that two structures are elementary equivalent with the Ehrenfeucht–Fraïssé games .  Elementarily equivalent structures  Two structures M and N of the same signature σ are elementarily equivalent if every first-order sentence (formula without free variables) over σ is true in M if and only if it is true in N , i.e. if M and N have the same complete first-order theory. If M and N are elementarily equivalent, one writes M ≡ N .  A first-order theory is complete if and only if any two of its models are elementarily equivalent.  For example, consider the language with one binary relation symbol '1, …, x n ) with free variables x 1 , …, x n , and all elements a 1 , …, a n of N , φ( a 1 , …, a n ) holds in N if and only if it holds in M :   N    ⊧   models   \models   φ( a 1 , …, a n ) iff M    ⊧   models   \models   φ( a 1 , …, a n ).   It follows that N is a substructure of M .  If N is a substructure of M , then both N and M can be interpreted as structures in the signature σ N consisting of σ together with a new constant symbol for every element of N . N is an elementary substructure of M if and only if N is a substructure of M and N and M are elementarily equivalent as σ N -structures.  If N is an elementary substructure of M , one writes N    ⪯   precedes-or-equals   \preceq    M and says that M is an elementary extension of N : M    ⪰   succeeds-or-equals   \succeq    N .  The downward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem gives a countable elementary substructure for any infinite first-order structure; the upward Löwenheim–Skolem theorem gives elementary extensions of any infinite first-order structure of arbitrarily large cardinality.  Tarski–Vaught test  The Tarski–Vaught test (or Tarski–Vaught criterion ) is a necessary and sufficient condition for a substructure N of a structure M to be an elementary substructure. It can be useful for constructing an elementary substructure of a large structure.  Let M be a structure of signature σ and N a substructure of M . N is an elementary substructure of M if and only if for every first-order formula φ( x , y 1 , …, y n ) over σ and all elements b 1 , …, b n from N , if M    ⊧   models   \models    x φ( x , b 1 , …, b n ), then there is an element a in N such that M    ⊧   models   \models   φ( a , b 1 , …, b n ).  Elementary embeddings  An elementary embedding of a structure N into a structure M of the same signature σ is a map h : N → M such that for every first-order σ-formula φ( x 1 , …, x n ) and all elements a 1 , …, a n of N ,   N    ⊧   models   \models   φ( a 1 , …, a n ) if and only if M    ⊧   models   \models   φ( h ( a 1 ), …, h ( a n )).   Every elementary embedding is a strong homomorphism , and its image is an elementary substructure.  Elementary embeddings are the most important maps in model theory. In set theory , elementary embeddings whose domain is V (the universe of set theory) play an important role in the theory of large cardinals (see also critical point ).
