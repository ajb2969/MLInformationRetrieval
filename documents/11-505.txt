   Inositol-1,4-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase      Inositol-1,4-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase   In enzymology , an inositol-1,4-bisphosphate 1-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1D-myo-inositol 1,4-bisphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1D-myo-inositol-1,4-bisphosphate 1-phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called inositol-polyphosphate 1-phosphatase . This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling system .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
