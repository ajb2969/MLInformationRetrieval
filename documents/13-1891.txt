Brownian excursion

In probability theory a Brownian excursion process is a stochastic processes that is closely related to a Wiener process (or Brownian motion). Realisations of Brownian excursion processes are essentially just realizations of a Wiener process selected to satisfy certain conditions. In particular, a Brownian excursion process is a Wiener process conditioned to be positive and to take the value 0 at time 1. Alternatively, it is a Brownian bridge process conditioned to be positive. BEPs are important because, among other reasons, they naturally arise as the limit process of a number of conditional functional central limit theorems.1
Definition
A Brownian excursion process, 
 
 
 
 , is a Wiener process (or Brownian motion) conditioned to be positive and to take the value 0 at time 1. Alternatively, it is a Brownian bridge process conditioned to be positive.
Another representation of a Brownian excursion 
 
 
 
  in terms of a Brownian motion process W (due to Paul Lévy and noted by Kiyoshi Itō and Henry P. McKean, Jr.2) is in terms of the last time 
 
 
 
  that W hits zero before time 1 and the first time 
 
 
 
  that Brownian motion 
 
 
 
  hits zero after time 1:3



Let 
 
 
 
  be the time that a Brownian bridge process 
 
 
 
  achieves its minimum on [0, 1]. Vervaat (1979) shows that



Properties
Vervaat's representation of a Brownian excursion has several consequences for various functions of 
 
 
 
 . In particular:



(this can also be derived by explicit calculations45) and



The following result holds:6



and the following values for the second moment and variance can be calculated by the exact form of the distribution and density:7



Groeneboom (1989), Lemma 4.2 gives an expression for the Laplace transform of (the density) of 
 
 
 
 . A formula for a certain double transform of the distribution of this area integral is given by Louchard (1984).
Groeneboom (1983) and Pitman (1983) give decompositions of Brownian motion

 
  in terms of i.i.d Brownian excursions and the least concave majorant (or greatest convex minorant) of 
 
 
 
 .

Connections and applications
The Brownian excursion area



arises in connection with the enumeration of connected graphs, many other problems in combinatorial theory; see e.g. ,8 ,9 ,10 ,11 ,12 and the limit distribution of the Betti numbers of certain varieties in cohomology theory .13 Takacs (1991a) shows that 
 
 
 
  has density


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the zeros of the Airy function and 
 
 
 
  is the confluent hypergeometric function. Janson and Louchard (2007) show that



and



They also give higher-order expansions in both cases.
Janson (2007) gives moments of 
 
 
 
  and many other area functionals. In particular,



Brownian excursions also arise in connection with queuing problems,14 railway traffic,1516 and the heights of random rooted binary trees.17
