   Malate—CoA ligase      Malate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , a malate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + malate + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + malyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , malate , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and malyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malate:CoA ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include malyl-CoA synthetase , malyl coenzyme A synthetase , and malate thiokinase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .
