   Gaelic football rankings      Gaelic football rankings   The Gaelic football rankings is an unofficial ranking system for men's county teams in Gaelic football . The county teams are ranked based on their game results, with the most successful teams being ranked highest. The point system used is based on that used by the IRB 1 with some modifications.  In this exchange-based point system, points are awarded based on the results of National Football League and All-Ireland Senior Football Championship games. The rankings have been computed based on results from 3 May 1925 and were presented in an abbreviated format for the first time in March 2014. 2  Uses of the rankings  The rankings are used by the followers of the GAA counties to rank the progression and current ability of their team. To date, the rankings have not been officially used by the Gaelic Athletic Association .  Current calculation method  The point system is calculated using a 'Points Exchange' system and is based on that used by the IRB 3 with some modifications. Teams receive points from each other based upon the match result – whatever one side gains, the other loses. The exchanges are based on the match result, the margin of victory, the previous rating points of each team, with a weighting for competition type and an allowance for home advantage, if relevant. As the system aims to reflect current team strengths, past successes or losses will fade and be superseded by more recent results. Although matches often result in an exchange of points, 'predictable' results lead to very minor changes, and may result in no change to either side's rating and subsequent ranking.  The maximum number of points which can be exchanged after a game is currently 4.50 in the National Football League and 9.00 in the Senior Football Championship.  Rules  The system ensures that it is representative of the teams' performance despite playing differing numbers of matches per annum, and the differing strength of opposition that teams have to face. The factors taken into account are as follows:   Match result (including winning margin)  Match status  Opposition strength  Home advantage   Match result  For each match played, points exchanges are awarded for the following five outcomes:   a win or loss by more than 5 points  a win or loss by up to and including 5 points  a draw   Match status  Different competitions have different importance to teams, and the ranking system has tried to respect this by using a weighting system, where the most significant matches are adjudged to be in the Championship. Points exchanges are tripled during the All-Ireland Senior Football Championship to recognise the importance of this competition. Historically, points exchanges during the National Football League were not modified (i.e. had a weighting of 1, one-third of the weighting of Championship games). However, since 2009 the League appears to have increased in competitiveness, and since then, points exchanges have been multiplied by 1.5 during the league (indicating that the results of League games are now weighted at half those of championship games). No further weightings are used within the League or Championship competitions. Matches played in the winter season ( O'Byrne Cup , Dr McKenna Cup , McGrath Cup , FBD Insurance League ), challenge matches or other secondary competitions are not included.  Opposition strength  A win against a very highly rated opponent is a considerably greater achievement than a win against a low-rated opponent, so the strength of the opposing team is a factor. Thus match results are more important than margins of victory in producing accurate rankings. This is because when a highly rated team plays a lowly rated team and manages to beat them comprehensively, it does not necessarily indicate how either team will perform in the future. The IRB ranking system proposes that if the rating point spread between teams is 10 or greater, the higher rated team will not gain any rating points should they win (conversely, if the lower rated team were to win, the maximum possible points would be exchanged). For the Gaelic Football Rankings, the rating point spread has been extended to 15 in order to take into account the fact that teams with a rating 15 points inferior occasionally beat the higher-rated team, a circumstance which rarely occurs in rugby.  Home advantage  When calculating points exchanges, the home side is handicapped by treating them as though they are three rating points better than their current rating. This results in the home side gaining fewer points for winning and losing more points for losing, and in doing so, aids to cancel out any advantage that a side may have by playing in front of their home crowd. Although Croke Park is not the official home venue of the Dublin County Board , it is treated as such, as 88% of all home games played by Dublin between 1925 and 2014 have been played at this venue (99% of championship fixtures and 81% of league fixtures).  Initial ratings, new and dormant counties  All counties were initially allocated 80 rating points, with the exception of New York and London who were both allocated 60 rating points. The reason for allocating lower initial rating points to both New York and London was to compensate for these teams' reduced exposure to other teams (i.e. they play significantly less games than the 32 counties from the island of Ireland).  Kilkenny , who have not competed in either League or Championship since May 2012 have been temporarily suspended from the rankings until they rejoin either competition. Their rating point score on suspension was 44.90, and on that date, they were ranked last, in 34th position.  Formula and examples  The rating points exchange is calculated as follows:        P  E  X   =     C   R   O  ,  D     *   C   w  t    *  S    c   w  t           P  E  X         C   subscript  R   O  D      subscript  C    w  t    S    subscript  c    w  t       PEX=CR_{O,D}*C_{wt}*Sc_{wt}              C   R  O    =   1  -    Δ  R  T   15     ;    C   R  D    =   -    Δ  R  T   15        formulae-sequence      C   subscript  R  O      1      normal-Δ  R  T   15         C   subscript  R  D          normal-Δ  R  T   15       CR_{O}=1-\frac{\Delta RT}{15};CR_{D}=-\frac{\Delta RT}{15}           Δ  R  T   =    P  r  e  v  i  o  u  s  R   T  A    -   P  r  e  v  i  o  u  s  R   T  B           normal-Δ  R  T       P  r  e  v  i  o  u  s  R   subscript  T  A      P  r  e  v  i  o  u  s  R   subscript  T  B       \Delta RT=PreviousRT_{A}-PreviousRT_{B}       Where:             P  E  X      P  E  X    PEX            C   R  O       C   subscript  R  O     CR_{O}            C   R  D       C   subscript  R  D     CR_{D}            C   w  t      subscript  C    w  t     C_{wt}            S   c   w  t        S   subscript  c    w  t      Sc_{wt}            Δ  R  T      normal-Δ  R  T    \Delta RT            P  r  e  v  i  o  u  s  R   T  A       P  r  e  v  i  o  u  s  R   subscript  T  A     PreviousRT_{A}            P  r  e  v  i  o  u  s  R   T  B       P  r  e  v  i  o  u  s  R   subscript  T  B     PreviousRT_{B}        Example 1      Competition   Venue   RT Team A   RT Team B   Team A Sc   Team B Sc    New RT Team A   New RT Team B     NFL   Team A Home   73   70   1-12   1-10    73.9   69.1             P  E  X   =     (   1  -    Δ  R  T   15    )   *   C   w  t    *  S    c   w  t     =    (   1  -     (   73  +  3   )   -  70   15    )   *  1.5  *  1   =   0.6  *  1.5  *  1   =  0.9          P  E  X         1      normal-Δ  R  T   15     subscript  C    w  t    S    subscript  c    w  t              1        73  3   70   15    1.5  1          0.6  1.5  1        0.9     PEX=(1-\frac{\Delta RT}{15})*C_{wt}*Sc_{wt}=(1-\frac{(73+3)-70}{15})*1.5*1=0.6%

 1.8       Data and model manipulation  Data  Match results dating from 3 May 1925 were used to complete the ratings from which the ranking system is derived. As of the 1st of May 2015, the results of 11,241 games have been included in the calculations used to compile the current rankings. However, the rankings are only reported from the start of the All-Ireland Football Championship of 1930 – this allowed a "bedding-in" period of 5 years for teams to find their level and for the rankings to present a true reflection of team's standing. Although results from pre-1925 are available, the introduction of the National Football League in 1926 greatly increased the number of games played by county teams, and thereby increased the accuaracy of the ranking system. Historical data (pre-2012) were extracted from the series of GAA Statistics books published by L O'Dare. 4 More recent data were extracted from the archive section of www.hoganstand.com. 5 Current results are also taken from www.hoganstand.com. 6  In total, the results of 73 games are missing from the dataset stretching back to 1925. This represents less than 0.7% of the total number of games. In addition, the venues for 63 games are unknown. The results of games with unknown venues are included in the rating calculations, with the venues allocated as neutral.  Between 1977 and 1981, "away" league finals were organised, normally between the winners of Division 2 of the National Football League and an overseas team, such as New York , London , Warwickshire or Lancashire . As Warwickshire or Lancashire teams were not regular competitors in other competitions, the results of games involving Warwickshire or Lancashire were not considered in the calculation of the rankings.  In the earlier years of the GAA, it was not uncommon for the Senior Football Championship to commence prior to the staging of the National Football League final. In addition, the autumn schedule of the National Football league occasionally commenced before All-Ireland final day. In order to provide a true reflection of the ranking of each team at the conclusion of a competition (either the Senior Football Championship or the National Football League), the results of games were ordered in the following sequence: first by year of competition, second by competition name and third by date.  Model manipulation  Although the calculation of the ratings is purely mathematical, the choice of parameters used for home advantage, championship weighting, score weighting and rating points spread were subjectively chosen so that, in the vast majority of years, the All-Ireland Champions were the number 1 ranked team at the end of that particular championship. In only 3 instances did the All-Ireland champions not finish as the number 1 ranked team. The exceptions to this were in 1933, 1942 and 1947 when the All-Ireland champions Cavan , Dublin and Cavan again, respectively, were beaten to number one position by Kerry teams which had won All-Ireland championships from 1930 to 1932, from 1939 to 1941 and in 1946.  Ranking records  (Figure)  Detailed view of number 1 ranked Gaelic football team - 1930:2014   In keeping with the common belief that the team which wins the All-Ireland championship is the best team at that particular moment in time, the All-Ireland winners have, for the vast majority of cases, occupied the number one ranking position immediately following their success.  It is of no surprise, therefore, that Kerry hold the record for longest period at number 1 and for overall time spent at number one.

However, extended unbeaten runs, and in particular comprising victories against teams with similarly high rating points, have permitted teams to amass large totals.
