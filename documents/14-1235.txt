Symplectic spinor bundle

In differential geometry, given a metaplectic structure

 
  on a 
 
 
 
 -dimensional symplectic manifold

 
  one defines the symplectic spinor bundle to be the Hilbert space bundle 
 
 
 
  associated to the metaplectic structure via the metaplectic representation. The metaplectic representation of the metaplectic group —the two-fold covering of the symplectic group— gives rise to an infinite rank vector bundle, this is the symplectic spinor construction due to Bertram Kostant.1
A section of the symplectic spinor bundle

 
  is called a symplectic spinor field.
Formal definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a metaplectic structure on a symplectic manifold

 
  that is, an equivariant lift of the symplectic frame bundle

 
  with respect to the double covering 
 
 

The symplectic spinor bundle

 
  is defined 2 to be the Hilbert space bundle


 
  associated to the metaplectic structure 
 
 
 
  via the metaplectic representation 
 
 
 
  also called the Segal-Shale-Weil 345 representation of 
 
 
 
  Here, the notation 
 
 
 
  denotes the group of unitary operators acting on a Hilbert space


The Segal-Shale-Weil representation 6 is an infinite dimensional unitary representation of the metaplectic group 
 
 
 
  on the space of all complex valued square Lebesgue integrable functions 
 
 
 
  Because of the infinite dimension, the Segal-Shale-Weil representation is not so easy to handle.
