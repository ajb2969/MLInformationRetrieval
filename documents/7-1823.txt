   Binomial number      Binomial number   In mathematics , specifically in number theory , a binomial number is an integer which can be obtained by evaluating a homogeneous polynomial containing two terms. It is a generalization of a Cunningham number .  Definition  A Binomial number is an integer obtained by evaluating a homogeneous polynomial containing two terms, also called a binomial . The form of this binomial is $\scriptstyle x^n \,\pm\, y^n$ , with $\scriptstyle x \, > \, y$ and $\scriptstyle n \, > \, 1$ . However, since $\scriptstyle x^n \,-\, y^n$ is always divisible by $\scriptstyle x \,-\, y$ , when studying the numbers generated from the version with the negative sign, they are usually divided by $\scriptstyle x \,-\, y$ first. Binomial numbers formed this way form Lucas sequences . Specifically:  $$U_n(a+b,ab)=\frac{a^n-b^n}{a-b},  \,$$ and $V_n(a+b,ab)=a^n+b^n \,$  Binomial numbers are a generalization of a Cunningham numbers , and it will be seen that the Cunningham numbers are Binomial numbers where $\scriptstyle y \,=\, 1$ . Other subsets of the Binomial numbers are the Mersenne numbers and the Repunits .  Factorization  The main reason for studying these numbers is to obtain their factorizations . Aside from algebraic factors , which are obtained by factoring the underlying polynomial ( binomial ) that was used to define the number, there are other prime factors (called primitive prime factors, because for a given $\scriptstyle x^n \,\pm\, y^n$ they do not factorize $\scriptstyle x^m \,\pm\, y^m$ with $\scriptstyle m \, < \, n$ ) which occur seemingly at random, and it is these which the number theorist is looking for.  Some Binomial numbers' underlying binomials have Aurifeuillian factorizations , 1 which can assist in finding prime factors . Cyclotomic polynomials are also helpful in finding factorizations. 2  The amount of work required in searching for a factor is considerably reduced by applying Legendre's theorem. 3 This theorem states that all factors of a binomial number are of the form $\scriptstyle kn \, + \, 1$ if $\scriptstyle n \,$ is even or $\scriptstyle 2kn \, + \, 1$ if it is odd.  Observation  Some people write "binomial number" when they mean binomial coefficient , but this usage is not standard and is deprecated.
