   Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase      Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase   In enzymology , a fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-fructose 6-phosphate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-fructose 6-phosphate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is beta-D-fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include fructose-2,6-bisphosphatase , and D-fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 2-phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 13 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
