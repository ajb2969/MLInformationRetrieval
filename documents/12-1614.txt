   Garside element      Garside element   In mathematics , a Garside element is an element of an algebraic structure such as a monoid that has several desirable properties.  Formally, if M is a monoid, then an element Δ of M is said to be a Garside element if the set of all right divisors of Δ,       {   r  ∈  M   ∣     for some  x   ∈  M   ,   Δ  =   x  r     }   ,     conditional-set    r  M    formulae-sequence      for some  x   M     normal-Δ    x  r       \{r\in M\mid\mbox{for some }x\in M,\Delta=xr\},   is the same set as the set of all left divisors of Δ,       {   ℓ  ∈  M   ∣     for some  x   ∈  M   ,   Δ  =   ℓ  x     }   ,     conditional-set    normal-ℓ  M    formulae-sequence      for some  x   M     normal-Δ    normal-ℓ  x       \{\ell\in M\mid\mbox{for some }x\in M,\Delta=\ell x\},   and this set generates  M .  A Garside element is in general not unique: any power of a Garside element is again a Garside element.  Garside monoid and Garside group  A Garside monoid is a monoid with the following properties:   Finitely generated and atomic;  Cancellative ;  The partial order relations of divisibility are lattices ;  There exists a Garside element.   A Garside monoid satisfies the Ore condition for multiplicative sets and hence embeds in its group of fractions: such a group is a Garside group . A Garside group is biautomatic and hence has soluble word problem and conjugacy problem . Examples of such groups include braid groups and, more generally, Artin groups of finite Coxeter type . 1  The name was coined by Dehornoy and Paris 2 to mark the work of F. A. Garside on the conjugacy problem for braid groups. 3  References   Benson Farb, Problems on mapping class groups and related topics (Volume 74 of Proceedings of symposia in pure mathematics) AMS Bookstore, 2006, ISBN 0-8218-3838-5, p. 357  Patrick Dehornoy, "Groupes de Garside", Ann .Sci.
