<h1>Speed of sound</h1>
<hr/>

<p>The <strong>speed of sound</strong> is the distance travelled per unit time by a <a href="sound_wave" title="wikilink">sound wave</a> propagating through an <a href="elasticity_(solid_mechanics)" title="wikilink">elastic</a> medium. The <a href="International_System_of_Units" title="wikilink">SI unit</a> of the speed of sound is the metre per second (m/s). In dry <a class="uri" href="air" title="wikilink">air</a> at , the speed of sound is . This is , or a kilometre in  or a mile in .</p>

<p>The speed of sound in an <a href="ideal_gas" title="wikilink">ideal gas</a> is independent of frequency, but does vary slightly with frequency in a real gas. It is proportional to the square root of the <a href="absolute_temperature" title="wikilink">absolute temperature</a>, but is independent of <a class="uri" href="pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> or <a class="uri" href="density" title="wikilink">density</a> for a given ideal gas. Sound speed in air varies slightly with pressure only because air is not quite an ideal gas. Although (in the case of gases only) the speed of sound is expressed in terms of a ratio of <em>both</em> density and pressure, these quantities cancel in ideal gases at any given temperature, composition, and heat capacity. This leads to a velocity formula for ideal gases which includes only the latter independent variables.</p>

<p>In common everyday speech, <em>speed of sound</em> refers to the speed of sound waves in <a href="Earth's_atmosphere" title="wikilink">air</a>. However, the speed of sound varies from substance to substance. Sound travels faster in <a class="uri" href="liquids" title="wikilink">liquids</a> and non-porous <a class="uri" href="solids" title="wikilink">solids</a> than it does in air. It travels about 4.3 times as fast in <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a> (), and nearly 15 times as fast in iron (), as in air at . Sound waves in solids are composed of compression waves (just as in gases and liquids), but there is also a different type of sound wave called a <a href="shear_wave" title="wikilink">shear wave</a>, which occurs only in solids. These different types of waves in solids usually travel at different speeds, as exhibited in <a class="uri" href="seismology" title="wikilink">seismology</a>. The speed of a compression sound wave in solids is determined by the medium's <a class="uri" href="compressibility" title="wikilink">compressibility</a>, <a href="shear_modulus" title="wikilink">shear modulus</a> and density. The speed of shear waves is determined only by the solid material's shear modulus and density.</p>

<p>In <a href="fluid_dynamics" title="wikilink">fluid dynamics</a>, the speed of sound in a fluid medium (gas or liquid) is used as a relative measure for the speed of an object moving through the medium. The speed of an object divided by the speed of sound in the fluid is called the <a href="Mach_number" title="wikilink">Mach number</a>. Objects moving at speeds greater than <em></em> are travelling at <a class="uri" href="supersonic" title="wikilink">supersonic</a> speeds.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p><a href="Sir_Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Sir Isaac Newton</a> computed the speed of sound in air as , which is too low by about 15%,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> but had neglected the effect of fluctuating temperature; that was later rectified by <a href="Pierre-Simon_Laplace" title="wikilink">Laplace</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>During the 17th century, there were several attempts to measure the speed of sound accurately, including attempts by <a href="Marin_Mersenne" title="wikilink">Marin Mersenne</a> in 1630 (1,380 Parisian feet per second), <a href="Pierre_Gassendi" title="wikilink">Pierre Gassendi</a> in 1635 (1,473 Parisian feet per second) and <a href="Robert_Boyle" title="wikilink">Robert Boyle</a> (1,125 Parisian feet per second).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1709, the Reverend <a href="William_Derham" title="wikilink">William Derham</a>, <a href="Rector_(ecclesiastical)" title="wikilink">Rector</a> of Upminster, published a more accurate measure of the speed of sound, at 1,072 <a href="Paris_inch" title="wikilink">Parisian feet</a> per second.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Derham used a telescope from the tower of the <a href="church_of_St_Laurence,_Upminster" title="wikilink">church of St Laurence, Upminster</a> to observe the flash of a distant shotgun being fired, and then measured the time until he heard the gunshot with a half second pendulum. Measurements were made of gunshots from a number of local landmarks, including <a href="North_Ockendon" title="wikilink">North Ockendon</a> church. The distance was known by triangulation, and thus the speed that the sound had travelled could be calculated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="basic-concept">Basic concept</h2>

<p>The transmission of sound can be illustrated by using a model consisting of an array of balls interconnected by springs. For real material the balls represent molecules and the springs represent the bonds between them. Sound passes through the model by compressing and expanding the springs, transmitting energy to neighbouring balls, which transmit energy to <em>their</em> springs, and so on. The speed of sound through the model depends on the stiffness of the springs (stiffer springs transmit energy more quickly). Effects like dispersion and reflection can also be understood using this model.</p>

<p>In a real material, the stiffness of the springs is called the <a href="elastic_modulus" title="wikilink">elastic modulus</a>, and the mass corresponds to the <a class="uri" href="density" title="wikilink">density</a>. All other things being equal (<a href="ceteris_paribus" title="wikilink">ceteris paribus</a>), sound will travel more slowly in spongy materials, and faster in stiffer ones. For instance, sound will travel 1.59 times faster in nickel than in bronze, due to the greater stiffness of nickel at about the same density. Similarly, sound travels about 1.41 times faster in light hydrogen (<a href="Hydrogen-1" title="wikilink">protium</a>) gas than in heavy hydrogen (<a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a>) gas, since deuterium has similar properties but twice the density. At the same time, "compression-type" sound will travel faster in solids than in liquids, and faster in liquids than in gases, because the solids are more difficult to compress than liquids, while liquids in turn are more difficult to compress than gases.</p>

<p>Some textbooks mistakenly state that the speed of sound increases with increasing density. This is usually illustrated by presenting data for three materials, such as air, water and steel, which also have vastly different compressibilities which more than make up for the density differences. An illustrative example of the two effects is that sound travels only 4.3 times faster in water than air, despite enormous differences in compressibility of the two media. The reason is that the larger density of water, which works to <em>slow</em> sound in water relative to air, nearly makes up for the compressibility differences in the two media.</p>
<h3 id="compression-and-shear-waves">Compression and shear waves</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>In a gas or liquid, sound consists of compression waves. In solids, waves propagate as two different types. A <a href="longitudinal_wave" title="wikilink">longitudinal wave</a> is associated with compression and decompression in the direction of travel, which is the same process as all sound waves in gases and liquids. A <a href="transverse_wave" title="wikilink">transverse wave</a>, called a <a href="shear_wave" title="wikilink">shear wave</a> in solids, is due to elastic deformation of the medium perpendicular to the direction of wave travel; the direction of shear-deformation is called the "<a href="Polarization_(waves)" title="wikilink">polarization</a>" of this type of wave. In general, transverse waves occur as a pair of <a class="uri" href="orthogonal" title="wikilink">orthogonal</a> polarizations. These different waves (compression waves and the different polarizations of shear waves) may have different speeds at the same frequency. Therefore, they arrive at an observer at different times, an extreme example being an <a class="uri" href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquake</a>, where sharp compression waves arrive first, and rocking transverse waves seconds later.</p>

<p>The speed of a compression wave in fluid is determined by the medium's <a class="uri" href="compressibility" title="wikilink">compressibility</a> and <a class="uri" href="density" title="wikilink">density</a>. In solids, the compression waves are analogous to those in fluids, depending on compressibility, density, and the additional factor of <a href="shear_modulus" title="wikilink">shear modulus</a>. The speed of shear waves, which can occur only in solids, is determined simply by the solid material's shear modulus and density.</p>

<p>In general, the speed of sound <em>c</em> is given by the Newton-Laplace equation:</p>

<p>If <a href="special_relativity" title="wikilink">relativistic</a> effects are important, the speed of sound is calculated from the <a href="relativistic_Euler_equations" title="wikilink">relativistic Euler equations</a>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="Acoustic_dispersion" title="wikilink"><strong>non-dispersive medium</strong></a>, sound speed is independent of <a href="sound_frequency" title="wikilink">sound frequency</a>, so the speeds of energy transport and sound propagation are the same for all frequencies. Air, a mixture of oxygen and nitrogen, constitutes a non-dispersive medium. However, air does contain a small amount of CO<sub>2</sub> which <em>is</em> a dispersive medium, and causes dispersion to air at <a href="ultrasound" title="wikilink">ultrasonic</a> frequencies (&gt; 28 <a class="uri" href="kHz" title="wikilink">kHz</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In a <strong>dispersive medium</strong> sound speed is a function of sound frequency, through the <a href="dispersion_relation" title="wikilink">dispersion relation</a>. Each frequency component propagates at its own speed, called the <a href="phase_velocity" title="wikilink">phase velocity</a>, while the energy of the disturbance propagates at the <a href="group_velocity" title="wikilink">group velocity</a>. The same phenomenon occurs with light waves; see <a href="Dispersion_(optics)#Group_and_phase_velocity" title="wikilink">optical dispersion</a> for a description.</p>
<h2 id="dependence-on-the-properties-of-the-medium">Dependence on the properties of the medium</h2>

<p>The speed of sound is variable and depends on the properties of the substance through which the wave is travelling. In solids, the speed of transverse (or shear) waves depends on the shear deformation under shear stress (called the <a href="shear_modulus" title="wikilink">shear modulus</a>), and the density of the medium. Longitudinal (or compression) waves in solids depend on the same two factors with the addition of a dependence on <a class="uri" href="compressibility" title="wikilink">compressibility</a>.</p>

<p>In fluids, only the medium's compressibility and density are the important factors, since fluids do not transmit shear stresses. In heterogeneous fluids, such as a liquid filled with gas bubbles, the density of the liquid and the compressibility of the gas affect the speed of sound in an additive manner, as demonstrated in the <a href="hot_chocolate_effect" title="wikilink">hot chocolate effect</a>.</p>

<p>In gases, adiabatic compressibility is directly related to pressure through the <a href="heat_capacity_ratio" title="wikilink">heat capacity ratio</a> (adiabatic index), and pressure and density are inversely related at a given temperature and composition, thus making only the latter independent properties (temperature, molecular composition, and heat capacity ratio) important. In low <a href="molecular_weight" title="wikilink">molecular weight</a> gases such as <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a>, sound propagates faster compared to heavier gases such as <a class="uri" href="xenon" title="wikilink">xenon</a> (for monatomic gases the speed of sound is about 75% of the mean speed that molecules move in the gas). For a given <a href="ideal_gas" title="wikilink">ideal gas</a> the sound speed depends only on its <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a>. At a constant temperature, the ideal gas <a class="uri" href="pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> has no effect on the speed of sound, because pressure and <a class="uri" href="density" title="wikilink">density</a> (also proportional to pressure) have equal but opposite effects on the speed of sound, and the two contributions cancel out exactly. In a similar way, compression waves in solids depend both on compressibility and density—just as in liquids—but in gases the density contributes to the compressibility in such a way that some part of each attribute factors out, leaving only a dependence on temperature, molecular weight, and heat capacity ratio (see derivations below). Thus, for a single given gas (where molecular weight does not change) and over a small temperature range (where heat capacity is relatively constant), the speed of sound becomes dependent on only the temperature of the gas.</p>

<p>In non-ideal gases, such as a <a href="Van_der_Waals_equation" title="wikilink">van der Waals gas</a>, the proportionality is not exact, and there is a slight dependence of sound velocity on the gas pressure.</p>

<p>Humidity has a small but measurable effect on sound speed (causing it to increase by about 0.1%-0.6%), because <a class="uri" href="oxygen" title="wikilink">oxygen</a> and <a class="uri" href="nitrogen" title="wikilink">nitrogen</a> molecules of the air are replaced by lighter molecules of <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a>. This is a simple mixing effect.</p>
<h2 id="altitude-variation-and-implications-for-atmospheric-acoustics">Altitude variation and implications for atmospheric acoustics</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Density and pressure decrease smoothly with altitude, but temperature (red) does not. The speed of sound (blue) depends only on the complicated temperature variation at altitude and can be calculated from it, since isolated density and pressure effects on sound speed cancel each other. Speed of sound increases with height in two regions of the stratosphere and thermosphere, due to heating effects in these regions.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In the <a href="Earth's_atmosphere" title="wikilink">Earth's atmosphere</a>, the chief factor affecting the speed of sound is the <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a>. For a given ideal gas with constant heat capacity and composition, sound speed is dependent <em>solely</em> upon temperature; see <a href="Speed_of_sound#Details" title="wikilink">Details</a> below. In such an ideal case, the effects of decreased density and decreased pressure of altitude cancel each other out, save for the residual effect of temperature.</p>

<p>Since temperature (and thus the speed of sound) decreases with increasing altitude up to , sound is <a href="refraction" title="wikilink">refracted</a> upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an <a href="acoustic_shadow" title="wikilink">acoustic shadow</a> at some distance from the source.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> The decrease of the sound speed with height is referred to as a negative <a href="sound_speed_gradient" title="wikilink">sound speed gradient</a>.</p>

<p>However, there are variations in this trend above . In particular, in the <a class="uri" href="stratosphere" title="wikilink">stratosphere</a> above about , the speed of sound increases with height, due to an increase in temperature from heating within the <a href="ozone_layer" title="wikilink">ozone layer</a>. This produces a positive sound speed gradient in this region. Still another region of positive gradient occurs at very high altitudes, in the aptly-named <a class="uri" href="thermosphere" title="wikilink">thermosphere</a> above .</p>

<p>This equation is correct to a much wider temperature range, but still depends on the approximation of heat capacity ratio being independent of temperature, and for this reason will fail, particularly at higher temperatures. It gives good predictions in relatively dry, cold, low pressure conditions, such as the Earth's <a class="uri" href="stratosphere" title="wikilink">stratosphere</a>. The equation fails at extremely low pressures and short wavelengths, due to dependence on the assumption that the wavelength of the sound in the gas is much longer than the average <a href="mean_free_path" title="wikilink">mean free path</a> between gas molecule collisions. A derivation of these equations will be given in the following section.</p>

<h3 id="effects-due-to-wind-shear">Effects due to wind shear</h3>

<p>The speed of sound varies with temperature. Since temperature and sound velocity normally decrease with increasing altitude, sound is <a href="refraction" title="wikilink">refracted</a> upward, away from listeners on the ground, creating an <a href="acoustic_shadow" title="wikilink">acoustic shadow</a> at some distance from the source.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> Wind shear of 4 m·s<sup>−1</sup>·km<sup>−1</sup> can produce refraction equal to a typical temperature <a href="lapse_rate" title="wikilink">lapse rate</a> of .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Higher values of wind gradient will refract sound downward toward the surface in the downwind direction,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> eliminating the acoustic shadow on the downwind side. This will increase the audibility of sounds downwind. This downwind refraction effect occurs because there is a wind gradient; the sound is not being carried along by the wind.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>

<p>For sound propagation, the exponential variation of wind speed with height can be defined as follows:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="general-physical-considerations">General physical considerations</h3>

<p>The medium in which a sound wave is travelling does not always respond adiabatically, and as a result the speed of sound can vary with frequency.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>

<p>The limitations of the concept of speed of sound due to extreme attenuation are also of concern. The attenuation which exists at sea level for high frequencies applies to successively lower frequencies as atmospheric pressure decreases, or as the <a href="mean_free_path" title="wikilink">mean free path</a> increases. For this reason, the concept of speed of sound (except for frequencies approaching zero) progressively loses its range of applicability at high altitudes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The standard equations for the speed of sound apply with reasonable accuracy only to situations in which the wavelength of the soundwave is considerably longer than the mean free path of molecules in a gas.</p>

<p>The molecular composition of the gas contributes both as the mass (M) of the molecules, and their heat capacities, and so both have an influence on speed of sound. In general, at the same molecular mass, monatomic gases have slightly higher sound speeds (over 9% higher) because they have a higher

<p>This gives the 9% difference, and would be a typical ratio for sound speeds at room temperature in <a class="uri" href="helium" title="wikilink">helium</a> vs. <a class="uri" href="deuterium" title="wikilink">deuterium</a>, each with a molecular weight of 4. Sound travels faster in helium than deuterium because adiabatic compression heats helium more, since the helium molecules can store heat energy from compression only in translation, but not rotation. Thus helium molecules (monatomic molecules) travel faster in a sound wave and transmit sound faster. (Sound generally travels at about 70% of the mean molecular speed in gases).</p>

<p>Note that in this example we have assumed that temperature is low enough that heat capacities are not influenced by molecular vibration (see <a href="heat_capacity" title="wikilink">heat capacity</a>). However, vibrational modes simply cause gammas which decrease toward 1, since vibration modes in a polyatomic gas gives the gas additional ways to store heat which do not affect temperature, and thus do not affect molecular velocity and sound velocity. Thus, the effect of higher temperatures and vibrational heat capacity acts to increase the difference between sound speed in monatomic vs. polyatomic molecules, with the speed remaining greater in monatomics.</p>
<h3 id="practical-application-to-air">Practical application to air</h3>

<p>By far the most important factor influencing the speed of sound in air is temperature. The speed is proportional to the square root of the absolute temperature, giving an increase of about 0.6 m/s per degree Celsius. For this reason, the pitch of a musical wind instrument increases as its temperature increases.</p>

<p>The speed of sound is raised by humidity but decreased by carbon dioxide. The difference between 0% and 100% humidity is about 1.5 m/s at standard pressure and temperature, but the size of the humidity effect increases dramatically with temperature. The carbon dioxide content of air is not fixed, due to both carbon pollution and human breath (e.g., in the air blown through wind instruments).</p>

<p>The dependence on frequency and pressure are normally insignificant in practical applications. In dry air, the speed of sound increases by about 0.1 m/s as the frequency rises from 10 Hz to 100 Hz. For audible frequencies above 100 Hz it is relatively constant. Standard values of the speed of sound are quoted in the limit of low frequencies, where the wavelength is large compared to the mean free path.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="mach-number">Mach number</h2>

<figcaption>U.S. Navy <a href="F/A-18_Hornet" title="wikilink">F/A-18</a> traveling near the speed of sound.

</figure>

<p>Mach number, a useful quantity in aerodynamics, is the ratio of air <a class="uri" href="speed" title="wikilink">speed</a> to the local speed of sound. At altitude, for reasons explained, Mach number is a function of temperature. Aircraft <a href="flight_instruments" title="wikilink">flight instruments</a>, however, operate using pressure differential to compute Mach number, not temperature. The assumption is that a particular pressure represents a particular altitude and, therefore, a standard temperature. Aircraft flight instruments need to operate this way because the stagnation pressure sensed by a <a href="Pitot_tube" title="wikilink">Pitot tube</a> is dependent on altitude as well as speed.</p>
<h2 id="experimental-methods">Experimental methods</h2>

<p>A range of different methods exist for the measurement of sound in air.</p>

<p>The earliest reasonably accurate estimate of the speed of sound in air was made by <a href="William_Derham" title="wikilink">William Derham</a>, and acknowledged by <a href="Isaac_Newton" title="wikilink">Isaac Newton</a>. Derham had a telescope at the top of the tower of the <a href="Church_of_St_Laurence,_Upminster" title="wikilink">Church of St Laurence</a> in <a class="uri" href="Upminster" title="wikilink">Upminster</a>, England. On a calm day, a synchronized pocket watch would be given to an assistant who would fire a shotgun at a pre-determined time from a conspicuous point some miles away, across the countryside. This could be confirmed by telescope. He then measured the interval between seeing gunsmoke and arrival of the sound using a half-second pendulum. The distance from where the gun was fired was found by triangulation, and simple division (distance / time) provided velocity. Lastly, by making many observations, using a range of different distances, the inaccuracy of the half-second pendulum could be averaged out, giving his final estimate of the speed of sound. Modern stopwatches enable this method to be used today over distances as short as 200–400 meters, and not needing something as loud as a shotgun.</p>
<h3 id="single-shot-timing-methods">Single-shot timing methods</h3>

<p>The simplest concept is the measurement made using two <a href="microphone" title="wikilink">microphones</a> and a fast recording device such as a <a href="Digital_data" title="wikilink">digital</a> storage scope. This method uses the following idea.</p>

<p>If a sound source and two microphones are arranged in a straight line, with the sound source at one end, then the following can be measured:</p>
<ol>
<li>The distance between the microphones (<em>x</em>), called microphone basis.</li>
<li>The time of arrival between the signals (delay) reaching the different microphones (<em>t</em>).</li>
</ol>

<p>Then <em>v</em> = <em>x</em> / <em>t</em>.</p>
<h3 id="other-methods">Other methods</h3>

<p>In these methods the <a class="uri" href="time" title="wikilink">time</a> measurement has been replaced by a measurement of the inverse of time (<a class="uri" href="frequency" title="wikilink">frequency</a>).</p>

<p><a href="Kundt's_tube" title="wikilink">Kundt's tube</a> is an example of an experiment which can be used to measure the speed of sound in a small volume. It has the advantage of being able to measure the speed of sound in any gas. This method uses a powder to make the <a href="Node_(physics)" title="wikilink">nodes</a> and <a href="antinode" title="wikilink">antinodes</a> visible to the human eye. This is an example of a compact experimental setup.</p>

<p>A <a href="tuning_fork" title="wikilink">tuning fork</a> can be held near the mouth of a long <a href="pipe_(material)" title="wikilink">pipe</a> which is dipping into a barrel of <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a>. In this system it is the case that the pipe can be brought to resonance if the length of the air column in the pipe is equal to <em>({1+2n}λ/4)</em> where <em>n</em> is an integer. As the <a href="antinode" title="wikilink">antinodal</a> point for the pipe at the open end is slightly outside the mouth of the pipe it is best to find two or more points of resonance and then measure half a wavelength between these.</p>

<p>Here it is the case that <em>v</em> = <em>fλ</em>.</p>
<h3 id="high-precision-measurements-in-air">High-precision measurements in air</h3>

<p>The effect from impurities can be significant when making high-precision measurements. Chemical dessicants can be used to dry the air, but will in turn contaminate the sample. The air can be dried cryogenically, but this has the effect of removing the carbon dioxide as well; therefore many high-precision measurements are performed with air free of carbon dioxide rather than with natural air. A 2002 review<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> found that a 1963 measurement by Smith and Harlow using a cylindrical resonator gave "the most probable value of the standard sound speed to date." The experiment was done with air from which the carbon dioxide had been removed, but the result was then corrected for this effect so as to be applicable to real air. The experiments were done at 30°C but corrected for temperature in order to report them at 0°C. The result was 331.45±0.01 m/s for dry air at STP, for frequencies from 93 Hz to 1500 Hz.</p>

<h3 id="speed-of-sound-in-solids">Speed of sound in solids</h3>
<h4 id="three-dimensional-solids">Three-dimensional solids</h4>

<p>In a solid, there is a non-zero stiffness both for volumetric deformations and shear deformations. Hence, it is possible to generate sound waves with different velocities dependent on the deformation mode. Sound waves generating volumetric deformations (compression) and shear deformations (shearing) are called pressure waves (longitudinal waves) and shear waves (transverse waves), respectively. In <a href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquakes</a>, the corresponding seismic waves are called <a href="P-wave" title="wikilink">P-waves</a> (primary waves) and <a href="S-wave" title="wikilink">S-waves</a> (secondary waves), respectively. The sound velocities of these two types of waves propagating in a homogeneous 3-dimensional solid are respectively given by<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a></p>

. Note that the speed of pressure waves depends both on the pressure and shear resistance properties of the material, while the speed of shear waves depends on the shear properties only.</p>

<p>Typically, pressure waves travel faster in materials than do shear waves, and in earthquakes this is the reason that the onset of an earthquake is often preceded by a quick upward-downward shock, before arrival of waves that produce a side-to-side motion. For example, for a typical steel alloy, <em>K</em> = 170 GPa, <em>G</em> = 80 GPa and

<p>In salt water that is free of air bubbles or suspended sediment, sound travels at about . The speed of sound in seawater depends on pressure (hence depth), temperature (a change of  ~ ), and <a class="uri" href="salinity" title="wikilink">salinity</a> (a change of 1<a href="Per_mil" title="wikilink">‰</a> ~ ), and empirical equations have been derived to accurately calculate sound speed from these variables.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Other factors affecting sound speed are minor. Since temperature decreases with depth while pressure and generally salinity increase, the profile of sound speed with depth generally shows a characteristic curve which decreases to a minimum at a depth of several hundred meters, then increases again with increasing depth (right).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> For more information see Dushaw et al.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

 with check value  for , , . This equation has a standard error of  for salinity between 25 and 40 <a href="Parts_per_thousand" title="wikilink">ppt</a>. See <a href="http://www.npl.co.uk/acoustics/techguides/soundseawater/">Technical Guides. Speed of Sound in Sea-Water</a> for an online calculator.</p>

<p>Other equations for sound speed in sea water are accurate over a wide range of conditions, but are far more complicated, e.g., that by V. A. Del Grosso<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> and the Chen-Millero-Li Equation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a></p>

<p>In contrast to a gas, the pressure and the density are provided by separate species, the pressure by the electrons and the density by the ions. The two are coupled through a fluctuating electric field.</p>
<h2 id="gradients">Gradients</h2>

<p>When sound spreads out evenly in all directions in three dimensions, the intensity drops in proportion to the inverse square of the distance. However, in the ocean there is a layer called the 'deep sound channel' or <a href="SOFAR_channel" title="wikilink">SOFAR channel</a> which can confine sound waves at a particular depth.</p>

<p>In the SOFAR channel, the speed of sound is lower than that in the layers above and below. Just as light waves will refract towards a region of higher <a href="refractive_index" title="wikilink">index</a>, sound waves will <a href="refraction" title="wikilink">refract</a> towards a region where their speed is reduced. The result is that sound gets confined in the layer, much the way light can be confined in a sheet of glass or <a href="optical_fiber" title="wikilink">optical fiber</a>. Thus, the sound is confined in essentially two dimensions. In two dimensions the intensity drops in proportion to only the inverse of the distance. This allows waves to travel much further before being undetectably faint.</p>

<p>A similar effect occurs in the atmosphere. <a href="Project_Mogul" title="wikilink">Project Mogul</a> successfully used this effect to detect a <a href="nuclear_explosion" title="wikilink">nuclear explosion</a> at a considerable distance.</p>
