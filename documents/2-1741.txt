   G2 (mathematics)      G2 (mathematics)     In mathematics , G 2 is the name of three simple Lie groups (a complex form, a compact real form and a split real form), their Lie algebras  $\mathfrak{g}_2$ , as well as some algebraic groups . They are the smallest of the five exceptional simple Lie groups . G 2 has rank 2 and dimension 14. It has two fundamental representations , with dimension 7 and 14.  The compact form of G 2 can be described as the automorphism group of the octonion algebra or, equivalently, as the subgroup of SO(7) that preserves any chosen particular vector in its 8-dimensional real  spinor  representation . Robert Bryant introduced the definition of G 2 as the subgroup of $\operatorname{GL}(\mathbb{R}^7)$ that preserves the non-degenerate 3-form  $$dx^{124}+dx^{235}+dx^{346}+dx^{450}+dx^{561}+dx^{602}+dx^{013},$$ (invariant under the cyclic permutation (0123456)) with $dx^{ijk}$ denoting $dx^i\wedge dx^j\wedge dx^k.$  In older books and papers, G 2 is sometimes denoted by E 2 .  Real forms  There are 3 simple real Lie algebras associated with this root system:   The underlying real Lie algebra of the complex Lie algebra G 2 has dimension 28. It has complex conjugation as an outer automorphism and is simply connected. The maximal compact subgroup of its associated group is the compact form of G 2 .  The Lie algebra of the compact form is 14-dimensional. The associated Lie group has no outer automorphisms, no center, and is simply connected and compact.  The Lie algebra of the non-compact (split) form has dimension 14. The associated simple Lie group has fundamental group of order 2 and its outer automorphism group is the trivial group. Its maximal compact subgroup is . It has a non-algebraic double cover that is simply connected.   Algebra  Dynkin diagram and Cartan matrix  The Dynkin diagram for G 2 is given by .  Its Cartan matrix is:  $$\left [\begin{smallmatrix}
 \;\,\, 2&-1\\
 -3&\;\,\, 2
 \end{smallmatrix}\right ]$$  Roots of G 2     The 12 vector root system of G 2 in 2 dimensions.  The A 2  Coxeter plane projection of the 12 vertices of the cuboctahedron contain the same 2D vector arrangement.  Graph of G2 as a subgroup of F4 and E8 projected into the Coxeter plane     Although they span a 2-dimensional space, as drawn, it is much more symmetric to consider them as vectors in a 2-dimensional subspace of a three-dimensional space.      (1,−1,0), (−1,1,0)  (1,0,−1), (−1,0,1)  (0,1,−1), (0,−1,1)    (2,−1,−1), (−2,1,1)  (1,−2,1), (−1,2,−1)  (1,1,−2), (−1,−1,2)      One set of simple roots , for  is:   (0,1,−1), (1,−2,1)   Weyl/Coxeter group  Its Weyl / Coxeter group is the dihedral group , D 6 of order 12.  Special holonomy  G 2 is one of the possible special groups that can appear as the holonomy group of a Riemannian metric . The manifolds of G 2 holonomy are also called G 2 -manifolds .  Polynomial Invariant  G 2 is the automorphism group of the following two polynomials in 7 non-commutative variables.  $$C_1 = t^2+u^2+v^2+w^2+x^2+y^2+z^2$$  $$C_2 = tuv + wtx  + ywu + zyt + vzw + xvy  + uxz$$ (± permutations)  which comes from the octonion algebra. The variables must be non-commutative otherwise the second polynomial would be identically zero.  Generators  Adding a representation of the 14 generators with coefficients A..N gives the matrix:  $$A\lambda_1+...+N\lambda_{14}=
 \begin{bmatrix}
  0 & C &-B & E &-D &-G &-F+M \\
 -C & 0 & A & F &-G+N&D-K&E+L \\
  B &-A & 0 &-N & M & L & K \\
 -E &-F & N & 0 &-A+H&-B+I&-C+J\\
  D &G-N &-M &A-H& 0 & J &-I \\
  G &K-D& -L&B-I&-J & 0 & H \\
 F-M&-E-L& -K &C-J& I & -H & 0 \\
 \end{bmatrix}$$  Representations  The characters of finite-dimensional representations of the real and complex Lie algebras and Lie groups are all given by the Weyl character formula . The dimensions of the smallest irreducible representations are :   1, 7, 14, 27, 64, 77 (twice), 182, 189, 273, 286, 378, 448, 714, 729, 748, 896, 924, 1254, 1547, 1728, 1729, 2079 (twice), 2261, 2926, 3003, 3289, 3542, 4096, 4914, 4928 (twice), 5005, 5103, 6630, 7293, 7371, 7722, 8372, 9177, 9660, 10206, 10556, 11571, 11648, 12096, 13090….   The 14-dimensional representation is the adjoint representation , and the 7-dimensional one is action of G 2 on the imaginary octonions.  There are two non-isomorphic irreducible representations of dimensions 77, 2079, 4928, 28652, etc. The fundamental representations are those with dimensions 14 and 7 (corresponding to the two nodes in the Dynkin diagram in the order such that the triple arrow points from the first to the second).  described the (infinite-dimensional) unitary irreducible representations of the split real form of G 2 .  Finite groups  The group G 2 ( q ) is the points of the algebraic group G 2 over the finite field  F q . These finite groups were first introduced by Leonard Eugene Dickson in  for odd q and  for even q . The order of G 2 ( q ) is . When , the group is simple , and when , it has a simple subgroup of index 2 isomorphic to 2 A 2 (3 2 ), and is the automorphism group of a maximal order of the octonions. The Janko group J 1 was first constructed as a subgroup of G 2 (11).  introduced twisted Ree groups  2 G 2 ( q ) of order for , an odd power of 3.
