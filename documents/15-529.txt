Radiometry
(Figure)
275px|thumb|Visulization of flux through differential area and solid angle. As always 
 
 
 
 
  is the unit normal to the incidant surface A, 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a unit vector in the direction of incident flux on the area element, θ is the angle between them. The factor 
 
 
 
  arises when the flux is not normal to the surface element, so the area normal to the flux is reduced.

For spectral quantities two definitions are in use to refer to the same quantity, in terms of frequency or wavelength.
