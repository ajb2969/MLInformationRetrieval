4-chlorobenzoate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, a 4-chlorobenzoate—CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-chlorobenzoate + CoA + ATP 
 
 
 
  4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA + AMP + diphosphate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-chlorobenzoate, CoA, and ATP, whereas its 3 products are 4-chlorobenzoyl-CoA, AMP, and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-chlorobenzoate:CoA ligase. This enzyme participates in 2,4-dichlorobenzoate degradation. It employs one cofactor, magnesium.
Structural studies
