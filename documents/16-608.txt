Finite volume method for one-dimensional steady state diffusion

Finite volume method in computational fluid dynamics is a discretization technique for partial differential equations that arise from physical conservation laws. These equations can be different in nature, e.g. elliptic, parabolic, or hyperbolic. First well-documented use was by Evans and Harlow (1957) at Los Alamos. The general equation for steady diffusion can be easily be derived from the general transport equation for property Φ by deleting transient and convective terms.1
General Transport equation can be define as



where,

 
  is density and 
 
 
 
  is conservative form of all fluid flow,

 
  is the Diffusion coefficient2 and 
 
 
 
  is the Source term.3

 
  is Net rate of flow of 
 
 
 
  out of fluid element(convection),

 
  is Rate of increase of 
 
 
 
  due to diffusion,

 
  is Rate of increase of 
 
 
 
  due to sources.


 
  is Rate of increase of 
 
 
 
  of fluid element(transient),
Conditions under which the transient and convective terms goes to zero:

Steady State
Low Reynolds Number

For one-dimensional steady state diffusion, General Transport equation reduces to:








or,









The following steps comprehend one-dimensional steady state diffusion -

  STEP 1
Grid Generation

Divide the domain in equal parts of small domain.
Place nodal points midway in between each small domain.

Create control volume using these nodal points.

Control volume and control volume & boundary faces (Figure 2)


Create control volume near the edge in such a way that the physical boundaries coincide with control volume boundaries.(Figure 1)
Assume a general nodal point 'P' for a general control volume.Adjacent nodal points in east and west are identified by E and W respectively.The west side face of the control volume is referred to by 'w' and east side control volume face by 'e'.(Figure 2)

The distance between WP, wP, Pe and PE are identified by 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
 ,
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively.(Figure 4)

STEP 2
Discretization


The crux of Finite volume method is to integrate governing equation all over control volume, known discretization.
Nodal points used to discretize equations.
At nodal point P control volume is defined as (Figure 3)





 where


 
  is Cross-sectional Area Cross section (geometry) of control volume face,
 
 
 
  is Volume,
 
 
 
 is average value of source S over control volume

It states that diffusive flux Fick's laws of diffusion

 
  from east face minus west face leads to generation of flux in control volume.


 
  diffusive coefficient and 
 
 
 
  is required in order to interpreter useful conclusion.
Central differencing technique 1 is used to derive 
 
 
 
  diffusive coefficient.










 
  gradient from east to west is calculated with help of nodal points.(Figure 4)







In practical situation source term can be linearize





Merging above equations leads to





Re-arranging





Compare and identify above equation with





 where

 {| |- ! 
 
 
 
  !! 
 
 
 
  !! 
 
 
 
  |- | 
 
 
 
  || 
 
 
 
  ||
 
 
 
  |}
STEP 3:
Solution of equations

Discretized equation must be set up at each of the nodal points in order to solve the problem.
The resulting system of linear algebraic equation Linear equation is then solved to obtain distribution of the property 
 
 
 
  at the nodal points by any form of matrix solution technique.
The matrix of higher order 2 can be solved in MATLAB.

This method can also be applied to a 2D situation. See Finite volume method for two dimensional diffusion problem.
