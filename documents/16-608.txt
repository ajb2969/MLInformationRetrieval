   Finite volume method for one-dimensional steady state diffusion      Finite volume method for one-dimensional steady state diffusion   Finite volume method in computational fluid dynamics is a discretization technique for partial differential equations that arise from physical conservation laws. These equations can be different in nature, e.g. elliptic , parabolic , or hyperbolic . First well-documented use was by Evans and Harlow (1957) at Los Alamos. The general equation for steady diffusion can be easily be derived from the general transport equation for property Φ by deleting transient and convective terms. 1  General Transport equation can be define as         ∂   ρ  ϕ     ∂  t    +   div   (   ρ  ϕ  υ   )     =    div   (   Γ   grad  ϕ    )    +   S  ϕ                ρ  ϕ      t     div    ρ  ϕ  υ        div    normal-Γ   grad  ϕ      subscript  S  ϕ      \frac{\partial\rho\phi}{\partial t}+\operatorname{div}(\rho\phi\upsilon)=%
 \operatorname{div}(\Gamma\operatorname{grad}\phi)+S_{\phi}     where,    ρ   ρ   \rho   is density and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is conservative form of all fluid flow,    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is the Diffusion coefficient 2 and   S   S   S   is the Source term. 3     div   (   ρ  ϕ  υ   )      div    ρ  ϕ  υ     \operatorname{div}(\rho\phi\upsilon)   is Net rate of flow of   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   out of fluid element( convection ),     div   (   Γ   grad  ϕ    )      div    normal-Γ   grad  ϕ      \operatorname{div}(\Gamma\operatorname{grad}\phi)   is Rate of increase of   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   due to diffusion ,     S  ϕ     subscript  S  ϕ    S_{\phi}   is Rate of increase of   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   due to sources.       ∂   ρ  ϕ     ∂  t           ρ  ϕ      t     \frac{\partial\rho\phi}{\partial t}   is Rate of increase of   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   of fluid element(transient),  Conditions under which the transient and convective terms goes to zero:   Steady State  Low Reynolds Number   For one-dimensional steady state diffusion, General Transport equation reduces to:          div   (   Γ   grad  ϕ    )    +   S  ϕ    =  0         div    normal-Γ   grad  ϕ      subscript  S  ϕ    0    \operatorname{div}(\Gamma\operatorname{grad}\phi)+S_{\phi}=0        or,           d   d  x     (   Γ   grad  ϕ    )    +   S  ϕ    =  0            d    d  x      normal-Γ   grad  ϕ      subscript  S  ϕ    0    \frac{d}{dx}(\Gamma\operatorname{grad}\phi)+S_{\phi}=0         The following steps comprehend one-dimensional steady state diffusion -  STEP 1  Grid Generation   Divide the domain in equal parts of small domain.  Place nodal points midway in between each small domain.   Create control volume using these nodal points.   (Figure)  Control volume and control volume & boundary faces (Figure 2)    Create control volume near the edge in such a way that the physical boundaries coincide with control volume boundaries.(Figure 1)  Assume a general nodal point 'P' for a general control volume .Adjacent nodal points in east and west are identified by E and W respectively.The west side face of the control volume is referred to by 'w' and east side control volume face by 'e'.(Figure 2)   (Figure)  Steady state one-dimensional diffusion (Figure 3)    The distance between WP, wP, Pe and PE are identified by    δ   x   W  P        δ   subscript  x    W  P      \delta x_{WP}   ,    δ   x   w  P        δ   subscript  x    w  P      \delta x_{wP}   ,    δ   x   P  e        δ   subscript  x    P  e      \delta x_{Pe}   and    δ   x   P  E        δ   subscript  x    P  E      \delta x_{PE}   respectively.(Figure 4)   STEP 2  Discretization    The crux of Finite volume method is to integrate governing equation all over control volume, known discretization.  Nodal points used to discretize equations.  At nodal point P control volume is defined as (Figure 3)          ∫   Δ  V      d   d  x     (   Γ    d  ϕ    d  x     )   d  V    +    ∫   Δ  V     S  d  V     =      (   Γ  A    d  ϕ    d  x     )   e   -    (   Γ  A    d  ϕ    d  x     )   w    +    S  →   Δ  V    =  0            subscript     normal-Δ  V        d    d  x      normal-Γ      d  ϕ     d  x     d  V      subscript     normal-Δ  V      S  d  V          subscript    normal-Γ  A      d  ϕ     d  x     e    subscript    normal-Γ  A      d  ϕ     d  x     w       normal-→  S   normal-Δ  V         0     \int_{\Delta V}\frac{d}{dx}\left(\Gamma\frac{d\phi}{dx}\right)dV+\int_{\Delta V%

The resulting system of linear algebraic equation Linear equation is then solved to obtain distribution of the property   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   at the nodal points by any form of matrix solution technique.  The matrix of higher order 2 can be solved in MATLAB .   This method can also be applied to a 2D situation. See Finite volume method for two dimensional diffusion problem .
