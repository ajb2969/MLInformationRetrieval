   Glycine dehydrogenase (cytochrome)      Glycine dehydrogenase (cytochrome)   In enzymology , a glycine dehydrogenase (cytochrome) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycine + H 2 O + 2 ferricytochrome c   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glyoxylate + NH 3 + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are glycine , H 2 O , and ferricytochrome c , whereas its 4 products are glyoxylate , NH 3 , ferrocytochrome c , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycine:ferricytochrome-c oxidoreductase (deaminating) . This enzyme is also called glycine---cytochrome c reductase . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.4.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
