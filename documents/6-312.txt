   Internal set      Internal set   In mathematical logic , in particular in model theory and non-standard analysis , an internal set is a set that is a member of a model.  The concept of internal sets is a tool in formulating the transfer principle , which concerns the logical relation between the properties of the real numbers R, and the properties of a larger field denoted *R called the hyperreal numbers . The field *R includes, in particular, infinitesimal ("infinitely small") numbers, providing a rigorous mathematical justification for their use. Roughly speaking, the idea is to express analysis over R in a suitable language of mathematical logic, and then point out that this language applies equally well to *R. This turns out to be possible because at the set-theoretic level, the propositions in such a language are interpreted to apply only to internal sets rather than to all sets (note that the term "language" is used in a loose sense in the above).  Edward Nelson's internal set theory is an axiomatic approach to non-standard analysis (see also Palmgren at constructive non-standard analysis ). Conventional infinitary accounts of non-standard analysis also use the concept of internal sets.  Internal sets in the ultrapower construction  Relative to the ultrapower construction of the hyperreal numbers as equivalence classes of sequences    ⟨   u  n   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  u  n     \langle u_{n}\rangle   , an internal subset [ A n ] of *R is one defined by a sequence of real sets    ⟨   A  n   ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  A  n     \langle A_{n}\rangle   , where a hyperreal    [   u  n   ]     delimited-[]   subscript  u  n     [u_{n}]   is said to belong to the set     [   A  n   ]     ⊂  *    ℝ      superscript      delimited-[]   subscript  A  n    ℝ    [A_{n}]\subset\;^{*}\!{\mathbb{R}}   if and only if the set of indices n such that     u  n   ∈   A  n        subscript  u  n    subscript  A  n     u_{n}\in A_{n}   , is a member of the ultrafilter used in the construction of *R.  More generally, an internal entity is a member of the natural extension of a real entity. Thus, every element of *R is internal; a subset of *R is internal if and only if it is a member of the natural extension     𝒫    *    (  ℝ  )        superscript  𝒫    ℝ    {}^{*}\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})   of the power set    𝒫   (  ℝ  )       𝒫  ℝ    \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R})   of R; etc.  Internal subsets of the reals  Every internal subset of   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   is necessarily finite , (see Theorem 3.9.1 Goldblatt, 1998). In other words, every internal infinite subset of the hyperreals necessarily contains non-standard elements.
