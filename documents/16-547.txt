Liénard–Chipart criterion

In control system theory, the Liénard–Chipart criterion is a stability criterion modified from Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion, proposed by A. Liénard and M. H. Chipart.1 This criterion has a computational advantage over Routh–Hurwitz criterion because they involve only about half the number of determinant computations.2
Algorithm
Recalling the Routh–Hurwitz stability criterion, it says that a necessary and sufficient condition for all the roots of the polynomial with real coefficients








to have negative real parts (i.e. 
 
 
 
  is Hurwitz stable) is that








where 
 
 
 
 
  is the i-th principal minor of the Hurwitz matrix associated with 
 
 
 
 .
Using the same notation as above, the Liénard–Chipart criterion is that 
 
 
 
  is Hurwitz-stable if and only if any one of the four conditions is satisfied:














Henceforth, one can see that by choosing one of these conditions, the determinants required to be evaluated are thus reduced.
