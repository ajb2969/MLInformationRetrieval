X-ray transform
In [[mathematics]], the '''X-ray transform''' (also called '''John transform''') is an [[integral transform]] introduced by [[Fritz John]] in 1938{{cite journal|last=Fritz|first=John|title=The ult

It is very closely related to the Radon transform, and coincides with it in two dimensions. In higher dimensions, the X-ray transform of a function is defined by integrating over lines rather than over hyperplanes as in the Radon transform. The X-ray transform derives its name from X-ray tomography because the X-ray transform of a function ƒ represents the scattering data of a tomographic scan through an inhomogeneous medium whose density is represented by the function ƒ. Inversion of the X-ray transform is therefore of practical importance because it allows one to reconstruct an unknown density ƒ from its known scattering data.
In detail, if ƒ is a compactly supported continuous function on the Euclidean space Rn, then the X-ray transform of ƒ is the function Xƒ defined on the set of all lines in Rn by


 
  where x0 is an initial point on the line and θ is a unit vector giving the direction of the line L. The latter integral is not regarded in the oriented sense: it is the integral with respect to the 1-dimensional Lebesgue measure on the Euclidean line L.
The X-ray transform satisfies an ultrahyperbolic wave equation called John's equation.
The Gauss hypergeometric function can be written as an X-ray transform .
