   Oh-My-God particle      Oh-My-God particle  The '''Oh-My-God particle''' was an [[ultra-high-energy cosmic ray]] (most likely an [[iron]] nucleus) detected on the evening of 15 October 1991 over Dugway Proving Ground , Utah , by the University of Utah 's Fly's Eye Cosmic Ray Detector . Its observation was a shock to astrophysicists (hence the name), who estimated its energy to be approximately  (, about 20 million times more energetic than the highest energy measured in radiation emitted by an extragalactic object); 1 in other words, an Atomic nucleus with kinetic energy equal to that of 48 Joules , or a baseball traveling at about . 2  The energy of this particle is some 40 million times that of the highest energy protons that have been produced in any terrestrial particle accelerator . However, only a small fraction of this energy would be available for an interaction with a proton or neutron on Earth, with most of the energy remaining in the form of kinetic energy of the products of the interaction. The effective energy available for such a collision is     2  E  m   c  2          2  E  m   superscript  c  2      \sqrt{2Emc^{2}}   , where   E   E   E   is the particle's energy, and    m   c  2       m   superscript  c  2     mc^{2}   is the mass energy of the proton. For the Oh-My-God particle, this gives , roughly 50 times the collision energy of the Large Hadron Collider .  Since the first observation at least fifteen similar events have been recorded, confirming the phenomenon. These very high energy cosmic ray particles are very rare; the energy of most cosmic ray particles is between 10 MeV and 10 GeV. More recent studies using the Telescope Array have suggested a source for the particles within a 20-degree "warm spot" in the direction of the constellation Ursa Major. 3 4  See also   Ultra-high-energy cosmic ray   References  "  Category:Cosmic rays  Category:1991 in science  Category:1991 in Utah     the blazar  Markarian 501 , measured in 1997 ↩  Open Questions in Physics.
