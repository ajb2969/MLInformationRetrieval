Sphere theorem (3-manifolds)

In mathematics, in the topology of 3-manifolds, the sphere theorem of  gives conditions for elements of the second homotopy group of a 3-manifold to be represented by embedded spheres.
One example is the following:
Let 
 
 
 
  be an orientable 3-manifold such that 
 
 
 
  is not the trivial group. Then there exists a non-zero element of 
 
 
 
  having a representative that is an embedding

 
 .
The proof of this version can be based on transversality methods, see Batude below.
Another more general version (also called the projective plane theorem due to Epstein) is:
Let 
 
 
 
  be any 3-manifold and 
 
 
 
  a 
 
 
 
 -invariant subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is a general position map such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is any neighborhood of the singular set 
 
 
 
 , then there is a map 
 
 
 
  satisfying



 
 ,


 
 ,


 
  is a covering map, and


 
  is a 2-sided submanifold (2-sphere or projective plane) of 
 
 
 
 .
