   Sphere theorem (3-manifolds)      Sphere theorem (3-manifolds)   In mathematics, in the topology of 3-manifolds , the sphere theorem of  gives conditions for elements of the second homotopy group of a 3-manifold to be represented by embedded spheres.  One example is the following:  Let   M   M   M   be an orientable 3-manifold such that     π  2    (  M  )        subscript  π  2   M    \pi_{2}(M)   is not the trivial group. Then there exists a non-zero element of     π  2    (  M  )        subscript  π  2   M    \pi_{2}(M)   having a representative that is an embedding      S  2   →  M     normal-→   superscript  S  2   M    S^{2}\to M   .  The proof of this version can be based on transversality methods, see Batude below.  Another more general version (also called the projective plane theorem due to Epstein) is:  Let   M   M   M   be any 3-manifold and   N   N   N   a     π  1    (  M  )        subscript  π  1   M    \pi_{1}(M)   - invariant subgroup of     π  2    (  M  )        subscript  π  2   M    \pi_{2}(M)   . If    f  :    S  2   →  M      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  S  2   M     f\colon S^{2}\to M   is a general position map such that     [  f  ]   ∉  N       delimited-[]  f   N    [f]\notin N   and   U   U   U   is any neighborhood of the singular set    Σ   (  f  )       normal-Σ  f    \Sigma(f)   , then there is a map    g  :    S  2   →  M      normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  S  2   M     g\colon S^{2}\to M   satisfying        [  g  ]   ∉  N       delimited-[]  g   N    [g]\notin N   ,       g   (   S  2   )    ⊂    f   (   S  2   )    ∪  U         g   superscript  S  2        f   superscript  S  2    U     g(S^{2})\subset f(S^{2})\cup U   ,      g  :    S  2   →   g   (   S  2   )        normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  S  2     g   superscript  S  2       g\colon S^{2}\to g(S^{2})   is a covering map , and      g   (   S  2   )       g   superscript  S  2     g(S^{2})   is a 2-sided submanifold ( 2-sphere or projective plane ) of   M   M   M   .   quoted in Hempel (p. 54)  References                 "  Category:Geometric topology  Category:3-manifolds  Category:Theorems in topology
