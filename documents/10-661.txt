   3alpha(or 20beta)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase      3alpha(or 20beta)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 3alpha(or 20beta)-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   androstan-3alpha,17beta-diol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   17beta-hydroxyandrostan-3-one + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are androstan-3alpha,17beta-diol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 17beta-hydroxyandrostan-3-one , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3alpha(or 20beta)-hydroxysteroid:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include cortisone reductase , (R)-20-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , dehydrogenase, 20beta-hydroxy steroid , Delta4-3-ketosteroid hydrogenase , 20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , 3alpha,20beta-hydroxysteroid:NAD + -oxidoreductase , NADH-20beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase , and 20beta-HSD . This enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthesis and c21-steroid hormone metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
