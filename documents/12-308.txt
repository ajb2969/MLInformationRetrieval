Constrained generalized inverse

In linear algebra, a constrained generalized inverse is obtained by solving a system of linear equations with an additional constraint that the solution is in a given subspace. One also says that the problem is described by a system of constrained linear equations.
In many practical problems, the solution 
 
 
 
  of a linear system of equations


 
  is acceptable only when it is in a certain linear subspace

 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
In the following, the orthogonal projection on 
 
 
 
  will be denoted by 
 
 
 
 . Constrained system of linear equations


 
  has a solution if and only if the unconstrained system of equations


 
  is solvable. If the subspace 
 
 
 
  is a proper subspace of 
 
 
 
 , then the matrix of the unconstrained problem 
 
 
 
  may be singular even if the system matrix 
 
 
 
  of the constrained problem is invertible (in that case, 
 
 
 
 ). This means that one needs to use a generalized inverse for the solution of the constrained problem. So, a generalized inverse of 
 
 
 
  is also called a 
 
 
 
 -constrained pseudoinverse of 
 
 
 
 .
An example of a pseudoinverse that can be used for the solution of a constrained problem is the Bott-Duffin inverse of 
 
 
 
  constrained to 
 
 
 
 , which is defined by the equation


 
  if the inverse on the right-hand-side exists.
