   Constrained generalized inverse      Constrained generalized inverse   In linear algebra , a constrained generalized inverse is obtained by solving a system of linear equations with an additional constraint that the solution is in a given subspace. One also says that the problem is described by a system of constrained linear equations .  In many practical problems, the solution   x   x   x   of a linear system of equations      A  x  =  b   (  with given  A  ∈    \R    m  ×  n    and  b  ∈    \R   m   )      fragments  A  x   b  italic-   fragments  normal-(  with given  A    superscript  \R    m  n    and  b    superscript  \R  m   normal-)     Ax=b\qquad(\text{with given }A\in\R^{m\times n}\text{ and }b\in\R^{m})   is acceptable only when it is in a certain linear subspace    L   L   L   of     \R   m     superscript  \R  m    \R^{m}   .  In the following, the orthogonal projection on   L   L   L   will be denoted by    P  L     subscript  P  L    P_{L}   . Constrained system of linear equations        A  x   =  b    x  ∈  L      formulae-sequence      A  x   b     x  L     Ax=b\qquad x\in L   has a solution if and only if the unconstrained system of equations         (   A   P  L    )   x   =  b    x  ∈    \R   m       formulae-sequence        A   subscript  P  L    x   b     x   superscript  \R  m      (AP_{L})x=b\qquad x\in\R^{m}   is solvable. If the subspace   L   L   L   is a proper subspace of     \R   m     superscript  \R  m    \R^{m}   , then the matrix of the unconstrained problem    (   A   P  L    )      A   subscript  P  L     (AP_{L})   may be singular even if the system matrix   A   A   A   of the constrained problem is invertible (in that case,    m  =  n      m  n    m=n   ). This means that one needs to use a generalized inverse for the solution of the constrained problem. So, a generalized inverse of    (   A   P  L    )      A   subscript  P  L     (AP_{L})   is also called a   L   L   L   - constrained pseudoinverse of   A   A   A   .  An example of a pseudoinverse that can be used for the solution of a constrained problem is the Bott-Duffin inverse of   A   A   A   constrained to   L   L   L   , which is defined by the equation        A  L   (   -  1   )    :=    P  L     (    A   P  L    +   P   L  ⟂     )    -  1      ,     assign   superscript   subscript  A  L     1       subscript  P  L    superscript      A   subscript  P  L     subscript  P   superscript  L  perpendicular-to       1       A_{L}^{(-1)}:=P_{L}(AP_{L}+P_{L^{\perp}})^{-1},   if the inverse on the right-hand-side exists.
