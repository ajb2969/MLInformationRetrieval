   Li√©nard equation      Li√©nard equation   In mathematics , more specifically in the study of dynamical systems and differential equations , a Li√©nard equation 1 is a second order differential equation, named after the French physicist Alfred-Marie Li√©nard .  During the development of radio and vacuum tube technology, Li√©nard equations were intensely studied as they can be used to model oscillating circuits . Under certain additional assumptions Li√©nard's theorem guarantees the uniqueness and existence of a limit cycle for such a system.  Definition  Let f and g be two continuously differentiable functions on R , with g an odd function and f an even function . Then the second order ordinary differential equation of the form          d  2   x    d   t  2     +   f   (  x  )     d  x    d  t     +   g   (  x  )     =  0             superscript  d  2   x     d   superscript  t  2       f  x      d  x     d  t       g  x    0    {d^{2}x\over dt^{2}}+f(x){dx\over dt}+g(x)=0     is called the Li√©nard equation .  Li√©nard system  The equation can be transformed into an equivalent two-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations . We define       F   (  x  )    :=    ‚à´  0  x    f   (  Œæ  )   d  Œæ       assign    F  x     superscript   subscript   0   x     f  Œæ  d  Œæ      F(x):=\int_{0}^{x}f(\xi)d\xi          x  1   :=   x      assign   subscript  x  1   x    x_{1}:=x\,          x  2   :=     d  x    d  t    +   F   (  x  )        assign   subscript  x  2         d  x     d  t      F  x      x_{2}:={dx\over dt}+F(x)   then       [       x  Àô   1         x  Àô   2      ]   =   ùê°   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    :=   [       x  2   -   F   (   x  1   )          -   g   (   x  1   )        ]            subscript   normal-Àô  x   1      subscript   normal-Àô  x   2       ùê°    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       assign         subscript  x  2     F   subscript  x  1           g   subscript  x  1          \begin{bmatrix}\dot{x}_{1}\\
 \dot{x}_{2}\end{bmatrix}=\mathbf{h}(x_{1},x_{2}):=\begin{bmatrix}x_{2}-F(x_{1}%
 )\\
 -g(x_{1})\end{bmatrix}     is called a Li√©nard system .  Alternatively, since Li√©nard equation itself is also an autonomous differential equation , the substitution    v  =    d  x    d  t        v      d  x     d  t      v={dx\over dt}   leads the Li√©nard equation to become a first order differential equation :        v    d  v    d  x     +   f   (  x  )   v   +   g   (  x  )     =  0          v      d  v     d  x       f  x  v     g  x    0    v{dv\over dx}+f(x)v+g(x)=0     which belongs to Abel equation of the second kind . 2 3  Example  The Van der Pol oscillator           d  2   x    d   t  2     -   Œº   (   1  -   x  2    )     d  x    d  t      +  x   =  0               superscript  d  2   x     d   superscript  t  2       Œº    1   superscript  x  2        d  x     d  t      x   0    {d^{2}x\over dt^{2}}-\mu(1-x^{2}){dx\over dt}+x=0     is a Li√©nard equation.  Li√©nard's theorem  A Li√©nard system has a unique and stable  limit cycle surrounding the origin if it satisfies the following additional properties:   g ( x ) > 0 for all x > 0;         lim   x  ‚Üí  ‚àû     F   (  x  )     :=    lim   x  ‚Üí  ‚àû      ‚à´  0  x    f   (  Œæ  )   d   Œæ      =  ‚àû   ;       assign    subscript    normal-‚Üí  x       F  x      subscript    normal-‚Üí  x       superscript   subscript   0   x     f  Œæ  d  Œæ              \lim_{x\to\infty}F(x):=\lim_{x\to\infty}\int_{0}^{x}f(\xi)d\xi\ =\infty;     F ( x ) has exactly one positive root at some value p , where F ( x )  0 and monotonic for x > p .
