Liénard equation

In mathematics, more specifically in the study of dynamical systems and differential equations, a Liénard equation1 is a second order differential equation, named after the French physicist Alfred-Marie Liénard.
During the development of radio and vacuum tube technology, Liénard equations were intensely studied as they can be used to model oscillating circuits. Under certain additional assumptions Liénard's theorem guarantees the uniqueness and existence of a limit cycle for such a system.
Definition
Let f and g be two continuously differentiable functions on R, with g an odd function and f an even function. Then the second order ordinary differential equation of the form



is called the Liénard equation.
Liénard system
The equation can be transformed into an equivalent two-dimensional system of ordinary differential equations. We define








 
  then



is called a Liénard system.
Alternatively, since Liénard equation itself is also an autonomous differential equation, the substitution 
 
 
 
  leads the Liénard equation to become a first order differential equation:



which belongs to Abel equation of the second kind.23
Example
The Van der Pol oscillator



is a Liénard equation.
Liénard's theorem
A Liénard system has a unique and stable limit cycle surrounding the origin if it satisfies the following additional properties:

g(x) > 0 for all x > 0;



F(x) has exactly one positive root at some value p, where F(x)  0 and monotonic for x > p.
