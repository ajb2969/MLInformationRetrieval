Shock factor

Shock factor is a commonly used figure of merit for estimating the amount of shock experienced by a naval target from an underwater explosion as a function of explosive charge weight, slant range, and depression angle (between vessel and charge).




R is the slant range in feet
W is the equivalent TNT charge weight in pounds = charge weight (lbs) · Relative effectiveness factor


 
  is the depression angle between the hull and warhead.

The application scenario for Equation 1 is illustrated by Figure 1.

The numeric result from computing the shock factor has no physical meaning, but it does provide a value that can be used to estimate the effect of an underwater blast on a vessel. Table 2 describes the effect of an explosion on a vessel for a range of shock factors.1

The magnitude of an explosion's effects have been shown through empirical and theoretical analyses to be related to the size of the explosive charge, the distance of the charge from the target, and the angular relationship of the hull to the shock wave.2
