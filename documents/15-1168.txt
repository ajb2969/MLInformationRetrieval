Delta12-fatty-acid desaturase

Delta12-fatty-acid desaturase (, Delta12 fatty acid desaturase, Delta12(omega6)-desaturase, oleoyl-CoA Delta12 desaturase, Delta12 desaturase, Delta12-desaturase) is an enzyme with system name acyl-CoA,hydrogen donor:oxygen Delta12-oxidoreductase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + reduced acceptor + O2

 
  Delta12-acyl-CoA + acceptor + 2 H2O
 

In the yeast Lipomyces starkeyi and in the American cockroach, this microsomal enzyme converts oleoyl-CoA into linoleoyl-CoA.
