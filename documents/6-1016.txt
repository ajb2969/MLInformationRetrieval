   Quaternion-Kähler manifold      Quaternion-Kähler manifold   In differential geometry , a quaternion-Kähler manifold (or quaternionic Kähler manifold ) is a Riemannian manifold whose Riemannian holonomy group is a subgroup of Sp( n )·Sp(1). Although this definition includes  hyperkähler manifolds , these are often excluded from the definition of a quaternion-Kähler manifold by imposing the condition that the scalar curvature is nonzero, or that the holonomy group is equal to Sp( n )·Sp(1). The definition introduced by Edmond Bonan 1 in 1965, uses a 3-dimensional subbundle H of End(T M ) of endomorphisms of the tangent bundle to a Riemannian M , that in 1976 Stefano Marchiafava and Giuliano Romani called I fibrato di Bonan . 2 For M to be quaternion-Kähler, H should be preserved by the Levi-Civita connection and pointwise isomorphic to the imaginary quaternions which act on T M preserving the metric. Simultaneously, in 1965, Edmond Bonan and Vivian Yoh Kraines 3 constructed the parallel 4-form. It was not until 1982 that Edmond Bonan proved an outstanding result : the analogue of hard Lefschetz theorem .        .   .   .

Ricci curvature  Quaternion-Kähler manifolds appear in Berger's list of Riemannian holonomies as the only manifolds of special holonomy with non-zero Ricci curvature. In fact, these manifolds are Einstein .If an Einstein constant of a quaternion-Kähler manifold is zero, it is hyperkähler . This case is often excluded from the definition. That is, quaternion-Kähler is defined as one with holonomy reduced to Sp( n )·Sp(1) and with non-zero Ricci curvature (which is constant).  Quaternion-Kähler manifolds divide naturally into those with positive and negative Ricci curvature.  Examples  There are no known examples of compact quaternion-Kähler manifolds which are not locally symmetric or hyperkähler. Symmetric quaternion-Kähler manifolds are also known as Wolf spaces . For any simple Lie group G , there is a unique Wolf space G / K obtained as a quotient of G by a subgroup       K  =    K  0   ⋅   SU   (  2  )      .      K   normal-⋅   subscript  K  0    SU  2      K=K_{0}\cdot\operatorname{SU}(2).     Here, SU(2) is the subgroup associated with the highest root of G , and K 0 is its centralizer in G . The Wolf spaces with positive Ricci curvature are compact and simply connected.  If G is Sp( n +1), the corresponding Wolf space is the quaternionic projective space       ℍ   P  n    .      ℍ   superscript  normal-P  n     \mathbb{H}\operatorname{P}^{n}.     It can be identified with a space of quaternionic lines in H n +1 .  It is conjectured that all quaternion-Kähler manifolds with positive Ricci curvature are symmetric.  Twistor spaces  Questions about quaternion-Kähler manifolds of positive Ricci curvature can be translated into the language of algebraic geometry using the methods of twistor theory (this approach is due to Penrose and Salamon). Let M be a quaternionic-Kähler manifold, and H the corresponding subbundle of End(T M ), pointwise isomorphic to the imaginary quaternions. Consider the corresponding S 2 -bundle S of all h in H satisfying . The points of S are identified with the complex structures on its base. Using this, it is can be shown that the total space Z of S is equipped with an almost complex structure .  Salamon proved that this almost complex structure is integrable, hence Z is a complex manifold. When the Ricci curvature of M is positive, Z is a projective Fano manifold , equipped with a holomorphic contact structure .  The converse is also true: a projective Fano manifold which admits a holomorphic contact structure is always a twistor space, hence quaternion-Kähler geometry with positive Ricci curvature is essentially equivalent to the geometry of holomorphic contact Fano manifolds.
