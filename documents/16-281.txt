Coenzyme gamma-F420-2:alpha-L-glutamate ligase

Coenzyme gamma-F420-2:alpha-L-glutamate ligase (, MJ1001, CofF protein, gamma-F420-2:alpha-L-glutamate ligase) is an enzyme with system name L-glutamate:coenzyme gamma-F420-2 (ADP-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + coenzyme gamma-F420-2 + L-glutamate

 
  ADP + phosphate + coenzyme alpha-F420-3
 

The enzyme caps the gamma-glutamyl tail of the hydride carrier coenzyme F420.
