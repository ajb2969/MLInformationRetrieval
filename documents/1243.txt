   Condensation point      Condensation point   In mathematics, a condensation point  p of a subset S of a topological space , is any point p , such that every open neighborhood of p contains uncountably many points of S . Thus, according to the axiom of choice , "condensation point" is synonymous with "    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   - accumulation point ".  Examples   If S = (0,1) is the open unit interval, a subset of the real numbers , then 0 is a condensation point of S .  If S is an uncountable subset of a set X endowed with the indiscrete topology , then any point p of X is a condensation point of X as the only open neighborhood of p is X itself.
