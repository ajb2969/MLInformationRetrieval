Uncial 0308

Codex 0308 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is one of the recently registered New Testament Greek uncial manuscripts. It consists of only a fragment of a single parchment leaf of a fourth-century codex, containing portions of the eleventh chapter of the Book of Revelation.
Description
The surviving texts of Revelation are verses 11:15-16 and 11:17-18; they are in fragmentary condition. Uncial 0308 measures 5.9 cm by 4.8 cm (8 x 8 cm) with the surviving leaf having 11 lines out of an original 14 (see reconstruction below). The text was written one column to a page, though line lengths were irregular. The letters Ε (epsilon) and Θ (theta) have longer the middle line, and they are similar to those from Codex Washingtonianus. These characters appear influenced by the shape of Coptic letters. The nomina sacra attested in this uncial fragment are ΚΣ (Kurios, Lord) and ΧΡΣ) (Christos, Christ). The number "twenty four" is also written using an abbreviation — ΚΔ. All the abbreviations are marked with the superscript bar.

Although the text of the codex is too brief to determine its textual character, it concurs with both Codex Sinaiticus and with 
 
 
47 (Papyrus 47), with one exception. In Rev 11:16 it has the textual variant κα]θημενο[ι, agreeing with Codex Alexandrinus, Uncial 051 and 
 
 
A against καθηνται—
 
 
47 and Codex Ephraemi—also οι καθηνται—Sinaiticus and 
 
 
K.1 In Rev 11:17 it has και οτι, a variant supported by
 
 
47, א, C and 2344. In Re 11:18 it has textual variant "τοις δουλοις σου και τοις προφηταις" (like: Sinaiticus and 
 
 
47),2 Textus Receptus and NA27 have: "τοις δουλοις σου τοις προφηταις". It differs two times with NA27 (και used 2 times more). The text of the codex was published by W. E. H. Cockle in 1999.3
It is cataloged among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri as P. Oxy. 4500, and is now part of the Sackler Library collection in Oxford.4
