   Uncial 0308      Uncial 0308   Codex 0308 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), is one of the recently registered New Testament Greek uncial  manuscripts . It consists of only a fragment of a single parchment leaf of a fourth-century codex , containing portions of the eleventh chapter of the Book of Revelation .  Description  The surviving texts of Revelation are verses 11:15-16 and 11:17-18; they are in fragmentary condition. Uncial 0308 measures 5.9 cm by 4.8 cm (8 x 8 cm) with the surviving leaf having 11 lines out of an original 14 (see reconstruction below). The text was written one column to a page, though line lengths were irregular. The letters Ε ( epsilon ) and Θ ( theta ) have longer the middle line, and they are similar to those from Codex Washingtonianus . These characters appear influenced by the shape of Coptic letters. The nomina sacra attested in this uncial fragment are ΚΣ ( Kurios , Lord) and ΧΡΣ ) ( Christos , Christ). The number "twenty four" is also written using an abbreviation — ΚΔ . All the abbreviations are marked with the superscript bar.

In Rev 11:16 it has the textual variant κα]θημενο[ι, agreeing with Codex Alexandrinus , Uncial 051 and   𝔐   𝔐   \mathfrak{M}    A against καθηνται—   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    47 and Codex Ephraemi —also οι καθηνται—Sinaiticus and   𝔐   𝔐   \mathfrak{M}    K . 1 In Rev 11:17 it has και οτι, a variant supported by   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    47 , א , C and 2344 . In Re 11:18 it has textual variant "τοις δουλοις σου και τοις προφηταις" (like: Sinaiticus and   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    47 ), 2  Textus Receptus and NA27 have: "τοις δουλοις σου τοις προφηταις". It differs two times with NA27 (και used 2 times more). The text of the codex was published by W. E. H. Cockle in 1999. 3  It is cataloged among the Oxyrhynchus Papyri as P. Oxy. 4500, and is now part of the Sackler Library collection in Oxford . 4  See also   List of New Testament uncials  Textual criticism   References  Further reading   W. E. H. Cockle, "4500.
