   Peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase      Peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase   Peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase (, vitamin K-dependent carboxylase , gamma-glutamyl carboxylase ) is an enzyme with system name peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone-epoxidizing) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   peptidyl-4-carboxyglutamate + 2,3-epoxyphylloquinone + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   peptidyl-glutamate + CO 2 + O 2 + phylloquinone    The enzyme can use various vitamin-K derivatives, including menaquinone .
