Peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase

Peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase (, vitamin K-dependent carboxylase, gamma-glutamyl carboxylase) is an enzyme with system name peptidyl-glutamate 4-carboxylase (2-methyl-3-phytyl-1,4-naphthoquinone-epoxidizing).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

peptidyl-4-carboxyglutamate + 2,3-epoxyphylloquinone + H2O 
 
 
 
  peptidyl-glutamate + CO2 + O2 + phylloquinone


The enzyme can use various vitamin-K derivatives, including menaquinone.
