   Quasi-polynomial      Quasi-polynomial   In mathematics , a quasi-polynomial ( pseudo-polynomial ) is a generalization of polynomials . While the coefficients of a polynomial come from a ring , the coefficients of quasi-polynomials are instead periodic functions with integral period. Quasi-polynomials appear throughout much of combinatorics as the enumerators for various objects.  A quasi-polynomial can be written as     q   (  k  )    =     c  d    (  k  )    k  d    +    c   d  -  1     (  k  )    k   d  -  1     +  ⋯  +    c  0    (  k  )           q  k        subscript  c  d   k   superscript  k  d       subscript  c    d  1    k   superscript  k    d  1     normal-⋯     subscript  c  0   k      q(k)=c_{d}(k)k^{d}+c_{d-1}(k)k^{d-1}+\cdots+c_{0}(k)   , where     c  i    (  k  )        subscript  c  i   k    c_{i}(k)   is a periodic function with integral period. If     c  d    (  k  )        subscript  c  d   k    c_{d}(k)   is not identically zero, then the degree of q is d . Equivalently, a function    f  :   ℕ  →  ℕ      normal-:  f   normal-→  ℕ  ℕ     f\colon\mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}   is a quasi-polynomial if there exist polynomials     p  0   ,  …  ,   p   s  -  1        subscript  p  0   normal-…   subscript  p    s  1      p_{0},\dots,p_{s-1}   such that     f   (  n  )    =    p  i    (  n  )          f  n      subscript  p  i   n     f(n)=p_{i}(n)   when    n  ≡   i  mod  s       n   modulo  i  s     n\equiv i\bmod s   . The polynomials    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   are called the constituents of f .  Examples   Given a d -dimensional polytope  P with rational vertices     v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n       subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n     v_{1},\dots,v_{n}   , define tP to be the convex hull of     t   v  1    ,  …  ,   t   v  n         t   subscript  v  1    normal-…    t   subscript  v  n      tv_{1},\dots,tv_{n}   . The function     L   (  P  ,  t  )    =   #   (    t  P   ∩   ℤ  d    )          L   P  t      normal-#      t  P    superscript  ℤ  d       L(P,t)=\#(tP\cap\mathbb{Z}^{d})   is a quasi-polynomial in t of degree d . In this case, L(P,t) is a function    ℕ  →  ℕ     normal-→  ℕ  ℕ    \mathbb{N}\to\mathbb{N}   . This is known as the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial , named after Eugène Ehrhart .  Given two quasi-polynomials F and G , the convolution of F and G is         (   F  *  G   )    (  k  )    =    ∑   m  =  0   k    F   (  m  )   G   (   k  -  m   )             F  G   k     superscript   subscript     m  0    k     F  m  G    k  m       (F*G)(k)=\sum_{m=0}^{k}F(m)G(k-m)   which is a quasi-polynomial with degree     ≤    deg  F   +   deg  G   +  1.       absent     degree  F    degree  G   1.     \leq\deg F+\deg G+1.
