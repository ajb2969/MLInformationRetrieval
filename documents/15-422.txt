   Nonlinear expectation      Nonlinear expectation   In probability theory , a nonlinear expectation is a nonlinear generalization of the expectation . Nonlinear expectations are useful in utility theory as they more closely match human behavior than traditional expectations.  Definition  A functional     𝔼  :   ℋ  →  ℝ      normal-:  𝔼   normal-→  ℋ  ℝ     \mathbb{E}:\mathcal{H}\to\mathbb{R}   (where   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   is a vector lattice on a probability space ) is a nonlinear expectation if it satisfies: 1 2   Monotonicity: if     X  ,  Y   ∈  ℋ       X  Y   ℋ    X,Y\in\mathcal{H}   such that    X  ≥  Y      X  Y    X\geq Y   then     𝔼   [  X  ]    ≥   𝔼   [  Y  ]          𝔼   delimited-[]  X      𝔼   delimited-[]  Y      \mathbb{E}[X]\geq\mathbb{E}[Y]     Preserving of constants: if    c  ∈  ℝ      c  ℝ    c\in\mathbb{R}   then     𝔼   [  c  ]    =  c        𝔼   delimited-[]  c    c    \mathbb{E}[c]=c      Often other properties are also desirable, for instance convexity , subadditivity , positive homogeneity , and translative of constants. 3  Examples   Expected value  Choquet expectation  g-expectation  If   ρ   ρ   \rho   is a risk measure then     𝔼   [  X  ]    :=   ρ   (   -  X   )       assign    𝔼   delimited-[]  X      ρ    X      \mathbb{E}[X]:=\rho(-X)   defines a nonlinear expectation   References  "  Category:Probability theory     ↩  ↩
