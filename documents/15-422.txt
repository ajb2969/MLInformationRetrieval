Nonlinear expectation

In probability theory, a nonlinear expectation is a nonlinear generalization of the expectation. Nonlinear expectations are useful in utility theory as they more closely match human behavior than traditional expectations.
Definition
A functional

 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is a vector lattice on a probability space) is a nonlinear expectation if it satisfies:12

Monotonicity: if 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 

Preserving of constants: if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 


Often other properties are also desirable, for instance convexity, subadditivity, positive homogeneity, and translative of constants.3
Examples

Expected value
Choquet expectation
g-expectation
If 
 
 
 
  is a risk measure then 
 
 
 
  defines a nonlinear expectation
