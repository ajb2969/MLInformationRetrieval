   Classifying space for U(n)      Classifying space for U(n)   In mathematics , the classifying space for the unitary group U( n ) is a space BU( n ) together with a universal bundle EU( n ) such that any hermitian bundle on a paracompact space  X is the pull-back of EU( n ) by a map X → BU( n ) unique up to homotopy.  This space with its universal fibration may be constructed as either   the Grassmannian of n -planes in an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space ; or,  the direct limit, with the induced topology, of Grassmannians of n planes.   Both constructions are detailed here.  Construction as an infinite Grassmannian  The total space EU( n ) of the universal bundle is given by        E  U   (  n  )    =   {    e  1   ,  …  ,    e  n     :     (   e  i   ,   e  j   )   =   δ   i  j     ,    e  i   ∈  ℋ    }    .        E  U  n    conditional-set    subscript  e  1   normal-…   subscript  e  n     formulae-sequence      subscript  e  i    subscript  e  j     subscript  δ    i  j        subscript  e  i   ℋ       EU(n)=\left\{e_{1},\ldots,e_{n}\ :\ (e_{i},e_{j})=\delta_{ij},e_{i}\in\mathcal%
 {H}\right\}.     Here, H is an infinite-dimensional complex Hilbert space, the e i are vectors in H , and    δ   i  j      subscript  δ    i  j     \delta_{ij}   is the Kronecker delta . The symbol    (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    (\cdot,\cdot)   is the inner product on H . Thus, we have that EU( n ) is the space of orthonormal  n -frames in H .  The group action of U( n ) on this space is the natural one. The base space is then       B  U   (  n  )    =     E  U   (  n  )    /  U    (  n  )          B  U  n         E  U  n   U   n     BU(n)=EU(n)/U(n)     and is the set of Grassmannian  n -dimensional subspaces (or n -planes) in H . That is,       B  U   (  n  )    =   {   V  ⊂   ℋ    :    dim  V   =  n   }         B  U  n    conditional-set    V  ℋ      dimension  V   n      BU(n)=\{V\subset\mathcal{H}\ :\ \dim V=n\}     so that V is an n -dimensional vector space.  Case of line bundles  For n = 1, one has EU(1) = S ∞ , which is known to be a contractible space . The base space is then BU(1) = CP ∞ , the infinite-dimensional complex projective space . Thus, the set of isomorphism classes of circle bundles over a manifold  M are in one-to-one correspondence with the homotopy classes of maps from M to CP ∞ .  One also has the relation that        B  U   (  1  )    =   P  U   (  ℋ  )     ,        B  U  1     P  U  ℋ     BU(1)=PU(\mathcal{H}),     that is, BU(1) is the infinite-dimensional projective unitary group . See that article for additional discussion and properties.  For a torus  T , which is abstractly isomorphic to U(1) × ... × U(1), but need not have a chosen identification, one writes B T .  The topological K-theory  K 0 (B T ) is given by numerical polynomials ; more details below.  Construction as an inductive limit  Let F n ( C k ) be the space of orthonormal families of n vectors in C k and let G n ( C k ) be the Grassmannian of n -dimensional subvector spaces of C k . The total space of the universal bundle can be taken to be the direct limit of the F n ( C k ) as k → ∞, while the base space is the direct limit of the G n ( C k ) as k → ∞.  Validity of the construction  In this section, we will define the topology on EU( n ) and prove that EU( n ) is indeed contractible.  The group U( n ) acts freely on F n ( C k ) and the quotient is the Grassmannian G n ( C k ). The map       F  n    (   𝐂  k   )        subscript  F  n    superscript  𝐂  k     \displaystyle F_{n}(\mathbf{C}^{k})     is a fibre bundle of fibre F n −1 ( C k −1 ). Thus because     π  p    (   𝐒    2  k   -  1    )        subscript  π  p    superscript  𝐒      2  k   1      \pi_{p}(\mathbf{S}^{2k-1})   is trivial and because of the long exact sequence of the fibration , we have        π  p    (    F  n    (   𝐂  k   )    )    =    π  p    (    F   n  -  1     (   𝐂   k  -  1    )    )           subscript  π  p      subscript  F  n    superscript  𝐂  k        subscript  π  p      subscript  F    n  1     superscript  𝐂    k  1        \pi_{p}(F_{n}(\mathbf{C}^{k}))=\pi_{p}(F_{n-1}(\mathbf{C}^{k-1}))     whenever    p  ≤    2  k   -  2       p      2  k   2     p\leq 2k-2   . By taking k big enough, precisely for    k  >      1  2   p   +  n   -  1       k          1  2   p   n   1     k>\tfrac{1}{2}p+n-1   , we can repeat the process and get         π  p    (    F  n    (   𝐂  k   )    )    =    π  p    (    F   n  -  1     (   𝐂   k  -  1    )    )    =  ⋯  =    π  p    (    F  1    (   𝐂    k  +  1   -  n    )    )    =    π  p    (   𝐒   k  -  n    )     .           subscript  π  p      subscript  F  n    superscript  𝐂  k        subscript  π  p      subscript  F    n  1     superscript  𝐂    k  1           normal-⋯          subscript  π  p      subscript  F  1    superscript  𝐂      k  1   n              subscript  π  p    superscript  𝐒    k  n        \pi_{p}(F_{n}(\mathbf{C}^{k}))=\pi_{p}(F_{n-1}(\mathbf{C}^{k-1}))=\cdots=\pi_{%
 p}(F_{1}(\mathbf{C}^{k+1-n}))=\pi_{p}(\mathbf{S}^{k-n}).     This last group is trivial for k > n + p . Let       E  U   (  n  )    =    lim  →     F  n    (   𝐂  k   )           E  U  n     subscript   subscript   normal-→    normal-→  k        subscript  F  n    superscript  𝐂  k       EU(n)={\lim_{\to}}\;_{k\to\infty}F_{n}(\mathbf{C}^{k})     be the direct limit of all the F n ( C k ) (with the induced topology). Let        G  n    (   𝐂  ∞   )    =    lim  →     G  n    (   𝐂  k   )            subscript  G  n    superscript  𝐂       subscript   subscript   normal-→    normal-→  k        subscript  G  n    superscript  𝐂  k       G_{n}(\mathbf{C}^{\infty})={\lim_{\to}}\;_{k\to\infty}G_{n}(\mathbf{C}^{k})     be the direct limit of all the G n ( C k ) (with the induced topology).   Lemma: The group     π  p    (   E  U   (  n  )    )        subscript  π  p     E  U  n     \pi_{p}(EU(n))   is trivial for all p ≥ 1.   Proof: Let γ : S p → EU( n ), since S p is compact , there exists k such that γ( S p ) is included in F n ( C k ). By taking k big enough, we see that γ is homotopic, with respect to the base point, to the constant map.   □   normal-□   \Box     In addition, U( n ) acts freely on EU( n ). The spaces F n ( C k ) and G n ( C k ) are CW-complexes . One can find a decomposition of these spaces into CW-complexes such that the decomposition of F n ( C k ), resp. G n ( C k ), is induced by restriction of the one for F n ( C k +1 ), resp. G n ( C k +1 ). Thus EU( n ) (and also G n ( C ∞ )) is a CW-complex. By Whitehead Theorem and the above Lemma, EU( n ) is contractible.  Cohomology of BU( n )   Proposition: The cohomology of the classifying space H* (BU( n )) is a ring of polynomials in n variables c 1 , ..., c n where c p is of degree 2 p .   Proof: Let us first consider the case n = 1. In this case, U(1) is the circle S 1 and the universal bundle is S ∞ → CP ∞ . It is well known 1 that the cohomology of CP k is isomorphic to     𝐑   [   c  1   ]    /   c  1   k  +  1          𝐑   delimited-[]   subscript  c  1      superscript   subscript  c  1     k  1      \mathbf{R}[c_{1}]/c_{1}^{k+1}   , where c 1 is the Euler class of the U(1)-bundle S 2 k +1 → CP k , and that the injections CP k → CP k +1 , for k ∈ N *, are compatible with these presentations of the cohomology of the projective spaces. This proves the Proposition for n = 1.  In the general case, let T be the subgroup of diagonal matrices. It is a maximal torus in U( n ). Its classifying space is ( CP ∞ ) n . and its cohomology is R [ x 1 , ..., x n ], where x i is the Euler class of the tautological bundle over the i -th CP ∞ . The Weyl group acts on T by permuting the diagonal entries, hence it acts on ( CP ∞ ) n by permutation of the factors. The induced action on its cohomology is the permutation of the    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   's. We deduce         H  *    (   B  U   (  n  )    )    =   𝐑   [   c  1   ,  …  ,   c  n   ]     ,         superscript  H      B  U  n      𝐑    subscript  c  1   normal-…   subscript  c  n       H^{*}(BU(n))=\mathbf{R}[c_{1},\ldots,c_{n}],   where the    c  i     subscript  c  i    c_{i}   's are the symmetric polynomials in the    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   's.   □   normal-□   \Box     In contrast to the above description of     H  *    (   B  U   (  n  )    )        superscript  H      B  U  n     H^{*}(BU(n))   , many authors allow non-homogeneous elements in the cohomology, leading to the description      H  *    (   B  U   (  n  )    )    =   ℤ   [   [   c  1   ,   c  2   ,  …  ,   c  n   ]   ]           superscript  H      B  U  n      ℤ   delimited-[]    subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2   normal-…   subscript  c  n        H^{*}(BU(n))=\mathbb{Z}[[c_{1},c_{2},...,c_{n}]]   . 2  K-theory of BU( n )  Let us consider topological complex K-theory as the cohomology theory represented by the spectrum    K  U      K  U    KU   . In this case,     K   U  *    (   B  U   (  n  )    )    ≅   ℤ   [  t  ,   t   -  1    ]    [   [   c  1   ,  …  ,   c  n   ]   ]          K   superscript  U      B  U  n      ℤ   t   superscript  t    1      delimited-[]    subscript  c  1   normal-…   subscript  c  n        KU^{*}(BU(n))\cong\mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}][[c_{1},...,c_{n}]]   , 3 and    K   U  *    (   B  U   (  n  )    )       K   subscript  U      B  U  n     KU_{*}(BU(n))   is the free    ℤ   [  t  ,   t   -  1    ]       ℤ   t   superscript  t    1       \mathbb{Z}[t,t^{-1}]   module on    β  0     subscript  β  0    \beta_{0}   and     β   i  1    …   β   i  r         subscript  β   subscript  i  1    normal-…   subscript  β   subscript  i  r      \beta_{i_{1}}\ldots\beta_{i_{r}}   for    n  ≥   i  j   >  0        n   subscript  i  j        0     n\geq i_{j}>0   and    r  ≤  n      r  n    r\leq n   . 4 In this description, the product structure on    K   U  *    (   B  U   (  n  )    )       K   subscript  U      B  U  n     KU_{*}(BU(n))   comes from the H-space structure of    B  U      B  U    BU   given by Whitney sum of vector bundles. This product is called the Pontryagin product .   The topological K-theory is known explicitly in terms of numerical  symmetric polynomials .  The K-theory reduces to computing K 0 , since K-theory is 2-periodic by the Bott periodicity theorem , and BU( n ) is a limit of complex manifolds, so it has a CW-structure with only cells in even dimensions, so odd K-theory vanishes.  Thus      K  *    (  X  )    =      π  *    (  K  )    ⊗   K  0     (  X  )           subscript  K    X      tensor-product     subscript  π    K    subscript  K  0    X     K_{*}(X)=\pi_{*}(K)\otimes K_{0}(X)   , where      π  *    (  K  )    =   𝐙   [  t  ,   t   -  1    ]           subscript  π    K     𝐙   t   superscript  t    1        \pi_{*}(K)=\mathbf{Z}[t,t^{-1}]   , where t is the Bott generator.  K 0 (BU(1)) is the ring of numerical polynomials in w , regarded as a subring of H ∗ (BU(1); Q ) = Q [ w ], where w is element dual to tautological bundle.  For the n -torus, K 0 (B T n ) is numerical polynomials in n variables. The map K 0 (B T n ) → K 0 (BU( n )) is onto, via a splitting principle , as T n is the maximal torus of U( n ). The map is the symmetrization map       f   (   w  1   ,  …  ,   w  n   )    ↦    1   n  !      ∑   σ  ∈   S  n      f   (   x   σ   (  1  )     ,  …  ,   x   σ   (  n  )     )         maps-to    f    subscript  w  1   normal-…   subscript  w  n         1    n      subscript     σ   subscript  S  n       f    subscript  x    σ  1    normal-…   subscript  x    σ  n          f(w_{1},\dots,w_{n})\mapsto\frac{1}{n!}\sum_{\sigma\in S_{n}}f(x_{\sigma(1)},%
 \dots,x_{\sigma(n)})     and the image can be identified as the symmetric polynomials satisfying the integrality condition that        (     n        n  1   ,   n  2   ,  …  ,   n  r       )   f   (   k  1   ,  …  ,   k  n   )    ∈  𝐙         binomial  n    subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2   normal-…   subscript  n  r     f    subscript  k  1   normal-…   subscript  k  n     𝐙    {n\choose n_{1},n_{2},\ldots,n_{r}}f(k_{1},\dots,k_{n})\in\mathbf{Z}     where       (     n        k  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,   k  m       )   =    n  !      k  1   !     k  2   !   ⋯    k  m   !          binomial  n    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-…   subscript  k  m         n        subscript  k  1       subscript  k  2    normal-⋯     subscript  k  m        {n\choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{m}}=\frac{n!}{k_{1}!\,k_{2}!\cdots k_{m}!}     is the multinomial coefficient and     k  1   ,  …  ,   k  n       subscript  k  1   normal-…   subscript  k  n     k_{1},\dots,k_{n}   contains r distinct integers, repeated     n  1   ,  …  ,   n  r       subscript  n  1   normal-…   subscript  n  r     n_{1},\dots,n_{r}   times, respectively.
