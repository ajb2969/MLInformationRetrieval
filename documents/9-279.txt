In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, an amoeba is a set associated with a polynomial in one or more complex variables. Amoebas have applications in algebraic geometry, especially tropical geometry.
Definition
Consider the function



defined on the set of all n-tuples

 
  of non-zero complex numbers with values in the Euclidean space

 
  given by the formula



Here, 'log' denotes the natural logarithm. If p(z) is a polynomial in 
 
 
 
  complex variables, its amoeba

 
  is defined as the image of the set of zeros of p under Log, so



Amoebas were introduced in 1994 in a book by Gelfand, Kapranov, and Zelevinsky.1
Properties

Any amoeba is a closed set.
Any connected component of the complement

 
  is convex.2
The area of an amoeba of a not identically zero polynomial in two complex variables is finite.
A two-dimensional amoeba has a number of "tentacles" which are infinitely long and exponentially narrow towards infinity.

Ronkin function
A useful tool in studying amoebas is the Ronkin function. For p(z) a polynomial in n complex variables, one defines the Ronkin function



by the formula



where 
 
 
 
  denotes 
 
 
 
  Equivalently, 
 
 
 
  is given by the integral



where



The Ronkin function is convex, and it is affine on each connected component of the complement of the amoeba of 
 
 
 
 .3
As an example, the Ronkin function of a monomial



with 
 
 
 
  is
