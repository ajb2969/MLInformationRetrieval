Liouville–Neumann series

In mathematics, the Liouville–Neumann series is an infinite series that corresponds to the resolvent formalism technique of solving the Fredholm integral equations in Fredholm theory.
Definition
The Liouville–Neumann series is defined as



which is a unique, continuous solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the second kind:



If the nth iterated kernel is defined as



then



with



The resolvent or solving kernel is given by



The solution of the integral equation becomes



Similar methods may be used to solve the Volterra equations.
