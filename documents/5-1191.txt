   Mapping cylinder      Mapping cylinder   In mathematics , specifically algebraic topology , the mapping cylinder of a function    f   f   f   between topological spaces    X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   is the quotient       M  f   =   (   (   [  0  ,  1  ]   ×  X  )   ∐  Y  )   /  ∼     fragments   subscript  M  f     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-[  0  normal-,  1  normal-]    X  normal-)   coproduct  Y  normal-)    similar-to    M_{f}=(([0,1]\times X)\amalg Y)\,/\,\sim   where the union is disjoint, and ∼ is the equivalence relation generated by         (  0  ,  x  )   ∼   f   (  x  )       for each  x   ∈  X    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to   0  x     f  x        for each  x   X     (0,x)\sim f(x)\quad\text{for each }x\in X.   That is, the mapping cylinder    M  f     subscript  M  f    M_{f}   is obtained by gluing one end of    X  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]       X   0  1     X\times[0,1]   to   Y   Y   Y   via the map   f   f   f   . Notice that the "top" of the cylinder     {  1  }   ×  X       1   X    \{1\}\times X   is homeomorphic to   X   X   X   , while the "bottom" is the space     f   (  X  )    ⊂  Y        f  X   Y    f(X)\subset Y   .  See 1 for more details.  Basic properties  The bottom Y is a deformation retract of    M  f     subscript  M  f    M_{f}   . The projection     M  f   →  Y     normal-→   subscript  M  f   Y    M_{f}\to Y   splits (via    Y  ∋  y  ↦  y  ∈  Y  ⊂   M  f        contains  Y  y    maps-to    y       Y        subscript  M  f      Y\ni y\mapsto y\in Y\subset M_{f}   ), and a deformation retraction   R   R   R   is given by:      R  :     M  f   ×  I   →   M  f       normal-:  R   normal-→     subscript  M  f   I    subscript  M  f      R:M_{f}\times I\rightarrow M_{f}          (   [  t  ,  x  ]   ,  s  )   ↦   [   s  ⋅  t   ,  x  ]      maps-to    t  x   s     normal-⋅  s  t   x     ([t,x],s)\mapsto[s\cdot t,x]     (where points in   Y   Y   Y   stay fixed, which is well-defined, because     [  0  ,  x  ]   =   [   s  ⋅  0   ,  x  ]        0  x     normal-⋅  s  0   x     [0,x]=[s\cdot 0,x]   for all   s   s   s   ).  The map    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is a homotopy equivalence if and only if the "top"     {  1  }   ×  X       1   X    \{1\}\times X   is a strong deformation retract of    M  f     subscript  M  f    M_{f}   . A proof can be found in. 2 An explicit formula for the strong deformation retraction is produced in. 3  Interpretation  The mapping cylinder may be viewed as a way to replace an arbitrary map by an equivalent cofibration , in the following sense:  Given a map    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   , the mapping cylinder is a space    M  f     subscript  M  f    M_{f}   , together with a cofibration     f  ~   :   X  →   M  f       normal-:   normal-~  f    normal-→  X   subscript  M  f      \tilde{f}\colon X\to M_{f}   and a surjective homotopy equivalence      M  f   →  Y     normal-→   subscript  M  f   Y    M_{f}\to Y   (indeed, Y is a deformation retract of    M  f     subscript  M  f    M_{f}   ), such that the composition    X  →   M  f   →  Y       normal-→  X   subscript  M  f     normal-→    Y     X\to M_{f}\to Y   equals f .  Thus the space Y gets replaced with a homotopy equivalent space    M  f     subscript  M  f    M_{f}   , and the map f with a lifted map    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   . Equivalently, the diagram      f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   gets replaced with a diagram       f  ~   :   X  →   M  f       normal-:   normal-~  f    normal-→  X   subscript  M  f      \tilde{f}\colon X\to M_{f}   together with a homotopy equivalence between them.  The construction serves to replace any map of topological spaces by a homotopy equivalent cofibration.  Note that pointwise, a cofibration is a closed inclusion .  Applications  Mapping cylinders are quite common homotopical tools. One use of mapping cylinders is to apply theorems concerning inclusions of spaces to general maps, which might not be injective .  Consequently, theorems or techniques (such as homology , cohomology or homotopy theory ) which are only dependent on the homotopy class of spaces and maps involved may be applied to    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\rightarrow Y   with the assumption that    X  ⊂  Y      X  Y    X\subset Y   and that   f   f   f   is actually the inclusion of a subspace.  Another, more intuitive appeal of the construction is that it accords with the usual mental image of a function as "sending" points of   X   X   X   to points of    Y  ,    Y   Y,   and hence of embedding   X   X   X   within    Y  ,    Y   Y,   despite the fact that the function need not be one-to-one.  Categorical application and interpretation  One can use the mapping cylinder to construct homotopy limits : given a diagram, replace the maps by cofibrations (using the mapping cylinder) and then take the ordinary pointwise limit (one must take a bit more care, but mapping cylinders are a component).  Conversely, the mapping cylinder is the homotopy pushout of the diagram where    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   and     id  X   :   X  →  X      normal-:   subscript  id  X    normal-→  X  X     \text{id}_{X}\colon X\to X   .  Mapping telescope  Given a sequence of maps       X  1    →   f  1     X  2    →   f  2     X  3   →  ⋯        subscript  normal-→   subscript  f  1     subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2      subscript  normal-→   subscript  f  2       subscript  X  3     normal-→    normal-⋯     X_{1}\to_{f_{1}}X_{2}\to_{f_{2}}X_{3}\to\cdots     the mapping telescope is the homotopical direct limit . If the maps are all already cofibrations (such as for the orthogonal groups     O   (  n  )    ⊂   O   (   n  +  1   )          O  n     O    n  1      O(n)\subset O(n+1)   ), then the direct limit is the union, but in general one must use the mapping telescope. The mapping telescope is a sequence of mapping cylinders, joined end-to-end. The picture of the construction looks like a stack of increasingly large cylinders, like a telescope.  Formally, one defines it as       (   ∐  i    [  0  ,  1  ]   ×   X  i   )   /   (   (  0  ,   x  i   )   ∼   (  1  ,  f   (   x  i   )   )   )      fragments   fragments  normal-(   subscript  coproduct  i    fragments  normal-[  0  normal-,  1  normal-]     subscript  X  i   normal-)     fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-,   subscript  x  i   normal-)   similar-to   fragments  normal-(  1  normal-,  f   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  i   normal-)   normal-)   normal-)     \Bigl(\coprod_{i}[0,1]\times X_{i}\Bigr)/((0,x_{i})\sim(1,f(x_{i})))     See also   Mapping cylinder (homological algebra)   References       "  Category:Algebraic topology     Algebraic Topology by Allen Hatcher.
