Polyconic projection

 Polyconic can refer either to a class of map projections or to a specific projection known less ambiguously as the American Polyconic. Polyconic as a class refers to those projections whose parallels are all non-concentric circular arcs, except for a straight equator, and the centers of these circles lie along a central axis. This description applies to projections in equatorial aspect.1
As a specific projection, the American Polyconic is conceptualized as "rolling" a cone tangent to the Earth at all parallels of latitude, instead of a single cone as in a normal conic projection. Each parallel is a circular arc of true scale. The scale is also true on the central meridian of the projection. The projection was in common use by many map-making agencies of the United States from the time of its proposal by Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler in 1825 until the middle of the 20th century.2
The projection is defined by:






where 
 
 
 
  is the longitude of the point to be projected; 
 
 
 
  is the latitude of the point to be projected; 
 
 
 
  is the longitude of the central meridian, and 
 
 
 
  is the latitude chosen to be the origin at 
 
 
 
 . To avoid division by zero, the formulas above are extended so that if
