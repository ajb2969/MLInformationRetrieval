   Polyconic projection      Polyconic projection    Polyconic can refer either to a class of map projections or to a specific projection known less ambiguously as the American Polyconic. Polyconic as a class refers to those projections whose parallels are all non-concentric circular arcs, except for a straight equator, and the centers of these circles lie along a central axis. This description applies to projections in equatorial aspect. 1  As a specific projection, the American Polyconic is conceptualized as "rolling" a cone tangent to the Earth at all parallels of latitude, instead of a single cone as in a normal conic projection. Each parallel is a circular arc of true scale. The scale is also true on the central meridian of the projection. The projection was in common use by many map-making agencies of the United States from the time of its proposal by Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler in 1825 until the middle of the 20th century. 2  The projection is defined by:      x  =    cot   (  φ  )     sin   (    (   λ  -   λ  0    )    sin   (  φ  )     )         x      φ         λ   subscript  λ  0      φ        x=\cot(\varphi)\sin((\lambda-\lambda_{0})\sin(\varphi))\,         y  =    φ  -   φ  0    +    cot   (  φ  )     (   1  -   cos   (    (   λ  -   λ  0    )    sin   (  φ  )     )     )         y      φ   subscript  φ  0        φ     1        λ   subscript  λ  0      φ          y=\varphi-\varphi_{0}+\cot(\varphi)(1-\cos((\lambda-\lambda_{0})\sin(\varphi)))\,     where   λ   λ   \lambda   is the longitude of the point to be projected;   φ   φ   \varphi   is the latitude of the point to be projected;    λ  0     subscript  λ  0    \lambda_{0}   is the longitude of the central meridian, and    φ  0     subscript  φ  0    \varphi_{0}   is the latitude chosen to be the origin at    λ  0     subscript  λ  0    \lambda_{0}   . To avoid division by zero, the formulas above are extended so that if    φ  =  0      φ  0    \varphi=0   then    x  =   λ  -   λ  0        x    λ   subscript  λ  0      x=\lambda-\lambda_{0}   and    y  =  0      y  0    y=0   .
