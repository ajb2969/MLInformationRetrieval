   Elongated square cupola      Elongated square cupola   In geometry , the elongated square cupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 19 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a square cupola ( J 4 ) by attaching an octagonal prism to its base. The solid can be seen as a rhombicuboctahedron with its "lid" (another square cupola ) removed.  Formulae  The following formulae for volume , surface area and circumradius can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    (   3  +    8   2    3    )    a  3    ≈   6.77124...   a  3          V      3      8    2    3     superscript  a  3           6.77124...   superscript  a  3       V=(3+\frac{8\sqrt{2}}{3})a^{3}\approx 6.77124...a^{3}       A  =    (   15  +   2   2    +   3    )    a  2    ≈   19.5605...   a  2          A      15    2    2      3     superscript  a  2           19.5605...   superscript  a  2       A=(15+2\sqrt{2}+\sqrt{3})a^{2}\approx 19.5605...a^{2}       C  =    (    1  2     5  +   2   2       )   a   ≈   1.39897...  a         C        1  2       5    2    2       a          1.39897...  a      C=(\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{2}})a\approx 1.39897...a     Dual polyhedron  The dual of the elongated square cupola has 20 faces: 8 isosceles triangles, 4 kites, 8 quadrilaterals.
