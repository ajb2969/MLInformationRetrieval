Elongated square cupola

In geometry, the elongated square cupola is one of the Johnson solids (J19). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a square cupola (J4) by attaching an octagonal prism to its base. The solid can be seen as a rhombicuboctahedron with its "lid" (another square cupola) removed.
Formulae
The following formulae for volume, surface area and circumradius can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length a:1




Dual polyhedron
The dual of the elongated square cupola has 20 faces: 8 isosceles triangles, 4 kites, 8 quadrilaterals.
