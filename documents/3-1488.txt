   Algebra (ring theory)      Algebra (ring theory)   In mathematics , specifically in ring theory , an algebra over a commutative ring is a generalization of the concept of an algebra over a field , where the base field  K is replaced by a commutative ring  R .  In this article, all rings are assumed to be unital .  Formal definition  Let R be a commutative ring. An R -algebra is an R -module  A together with a binary operation [·, ·]       [  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ]   :    A  ×  A   →  A      normal-:   normal-⋅  normal-⋅    normal-→    A  A   A     [\cdot,\cdot]:A\times A\to A     called A - multiplication , which satisfies the following axiom:   Bilinearity :           [    α  x   +   β  y    ,  z  ]   =    α   [  x  ,  z  ]    +   β   [  y  ,  z  ]      ,    [  z  ,    α  x   +   β  y    ]   =    α   [  z  ,  x  ]    +   β   [  z  ,  y  ]         formulae-sequence         α  x     β  y    z       α   x  z      β   y  z         z      α  x     β  y         α   z  x      β   z  y        [\alpha x+\beta y,z]=\alpha[x,z]+\beta[y,z],\quad[z,\alpha x+\beta y]=\alpha[z%
 ,x]+\beta[z,y]         for all scalars   α   α   \alpha   ,   β   β   \beta   in R and all elements x , y , z in A .   Example  Split-biquaternions  The split-biquaternions are an example of an algebra over a ring that is not a field.  The base ring of the split-biquaternions is the ring of split-complex numbers (or hyperbolic numbers, also perplex numbers), which are a two-dimensional commutative  algebra over the real numbers different from the complex numbers . Every split-complex number has the form   x + y  j ,   where x and y are real numbers . The number j is similar to the imaginary unit  i , except that   j 2 = +1.   A split-biquaternion is a hypercomplex number of the form      q  =   w  +   x  i   +   y  j   +   z   k         q    w    x  i     y  j     z  k      q=w+xi+yj+zk\!   where w , x , y , and z are split-complex numbers and i, j, and k multiply as in the quaternion group . Since each coefficient  w , x , y , z spans two real  dimensions , the split-biquaternion is an element of an eight-dimensional vector space . Considering that it carries a multiplication, this vector space is an algebra over the real field, or an algebra over a ring where the split-complex numbers form the ring. This algebra was introduced by William Kingdon Clifford in an 1873 article for the London Mathematical Society . It has been repeatedly noted in mathematical literature since then, variously as a deviation in terminology, an illustration of the tensor product of algebras , and as an illustration of the direct sum of algebras .  Associative algebras  If A is a monoid under A -multiplication (it satisfies associativity and it has an identity), then the R -algebra is called an associative algebra . An associative algebra forms a ring over R and provides a generalization of a ring. An equivalent definition of an associative R -algebra is a ring homomorphism    f  :   R  →  A      normal-:  f   normal-→  R  A     f:R\to A   such that the image of f is contained in the center of A .  If the ring B is a commutative ring, a simpler, alternative definition is: Given a ring homomorphism    λ  :   A  →  B      normal-:  λ   normal-→  A  B     \lambda:A\to B   we say that B is an A -algebra. 1  A ring homomorphism    ρ  :   A  →  B      normal-:  ρ   normal-→  A  B     \rho:A\to B   shall always map the identity of A to the identity of B . We also say that B / A is an algebra over A given by   ρ   ρ   \rho   . Every ring is a   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   -algebra. 2  Non-associative algebras  A non-associative algebra (or distributive algebra ) over a field (or a commutative ring) K is a K -vector space (or more generally a module ) A equipped with a K - bilinear map  A × A → A which establishes a binary multiplication operation on A . Since it is not assumed that the multiplication is associative, using parentheses to indicate the order of multiplications is necessary. For example, the expressions ( ab )( cd ), ( a ( bc )) d and a ( b ( cd )) may all yield different answers.
