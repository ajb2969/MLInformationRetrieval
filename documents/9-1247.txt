   Matter-dominated era      Matter-dominated era   The matter-dominated era was the epoch in the evolution of the Universe that began when the radiation-dominated era ended, when the Universe was about 47,000 years old. 1 Although it was often said that we still live in the matter-dominated era, it is more correct to say that when the Universe was about 9.8 billion years old, 2 this era ended and was replaced by the dark-energy-dominated era . This change of the perspective occurred when the cosmological constant or dark energy was first observed in the late 1990s.  In the matter-dominated era, the energy density of matter exceeds the energy density of radiation in the universe (and it should exceed the vacuum energy density i.e. dark energy, too). 3  For a matter dominated universe the evolution of the scale factor in the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric is easily obtained solving the Friedmann equations :       a   (  t  )    ∝   t   2  /  3       proportional-to    a  t    superscript  t    2  3      a(t)\propto t^{2/3}     References    "  Category:Physical cosmology     Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.41 ↩  Ryden, Barbara, "Introduction to Cosmology", 2006, eqn. 6.33 ↩  Zelik, M and Gregory, S: "Introductory Astronomy & Astrophysics", page 497.
