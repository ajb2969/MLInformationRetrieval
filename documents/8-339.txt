Threshold energy

In particle physics, the threshold energy for production of a particle is the minimum kinetic energy a pair of traveling particles must have when they collide. The threshold energy is always greater than or equal to the rest energy of the desired particle. In most cases, since momentum is also conserved, the threshold energy is significantly greater than the rest energy of the desired particle - and thus there will still be considerable kinetic energy in the final particles.
Example
Look at the reaction of a proton hitting a stationary proton, 
 
 
 
 .
By going into the center of mass frame, and assuming the outgoing particles have no kinetic energy the conservation of energy equation is:





Using relativistic velocity additions:



So the energy of the proton must be 
 
 
 
 MeV.
A more general example
Let's look at the case where a particle 1 with lab energy 
 
 
 
  (momentum 
 
 
 
 ) and mass 
 
 
 
 
  impinges on a target particle 2 at rest in the lab, i.e. with lab energy and mass 
 
 
 
 . The threshold energy 
 
 
 
  to produce three particles of masses 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



is then found by asking these three particles to be at rest in the center of mass frame (symbols with hat indicate quantities in the center of mass frame):


 
  .
Here 
 
 
 
  is the total energy available in the center of mass frame.
Using 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  one derives that
