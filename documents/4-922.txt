   Full and faithful functors      Full and faithful functors   In category theory , a faithful functor (resp. a full functor ) is a functor that is injective (resp. surjective ) when restricted to each set of morphisms that have a given source and target.  Formal definitions  Explicitly, let C and D be ( locally small ) categories and let F : C ‚Üí D be a functor from C to D . The functor F induces a function       F   X  ,  Y    :     Hom  ùíû    (  X  ,  Y  )    ‚Üí    Hom  ùíü    (   F   (  X  )    ,   F   (  Y  )    )        normal-:   subscript  F   X  Y     normal-‚Üí     subscript  Hom  ùíû    X  Y       subscript  Hom  ùíü      F  X     F  Y        F_{X,Y}\colon\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)\rightarrow\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{%
 D}}(F(X),F(Y))   for every pair of objects X and Y in C . The functor F is said to be   faithful if F X , Y is injective 1 2  full if F X , Y is surjective 3 4  fully faithful if F X , Y is bijective   for each X and Y in C .  Properties  A faithful functor need not be injective on objects or morphisms. That is, two objects X and X ‚Ä≤ may map to the same object in D (which is why the range of a full and faithful functor is not necessarily isomorphic to C ), and two morphisms f : X ‚Üí Y and f ‚Ä≤ : X ‚Ä≤ ‚Üí Y ‚Ä≤ (with different domains/codomains) may map to the same morphism in D . Likewise, a full functor need not be surjective on objects or morphisms. There may be objects in D not of the form FX for some X in C . Morphisms between such objects clearly cannot come from morphisms in C .  A full and faithful functor is necessarily injective on objects up to isomorphism. That is, if F : C ‚Üí D is a full and faithful functor and     F   (  X  )    ‚âÖ   F   (  Y  )          F  X     F  Y     F(X)\cong F(Y)   then    X  ‚âÖ  Y      X  Y    X\cong Y   .  Examples   The forgetful functor  U : Grp ‚Üí Set is faithful as each group maps to a unique set and the group homomorphism are a subset of the functions. This functor is not full as there are functions between groups which are not group homomorphisms . A category with a faithful functor to Set is (by definition) a concrete category ; in general, that forgetful functor is not full.    The inclusion functor Ab ‚Üí Grp is fully faithful, since each abelian group maps to a unique group, and any group homomorphism between abelian groups is preserved in Grp .
