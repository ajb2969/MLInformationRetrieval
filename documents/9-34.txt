   Coble creep      Coble creep    Coble creep , a form of diffusion creep , is a mechanism for deformation of crystalline  solids . Coble creep occurs through the diffusion of atoms in a material along the grain boundaries , which produces a net flow of material and a sliding of the grain boundaries.  Coble creep is named after Robert L. Coble , who first reported his theory of how materials creep over time in 1962 in the Journal of Applied Physics [ http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id; ;=JAPIAU000034000006001679000001&idtype;=cvips&gifs;=yes].  The strain rate in a material experiencing Coble creep is given by:        d  ϵ    d  t    =    σ   d  3     D   g  b     e   -     Q   C  o  b  l  e    /  R   T              d  ϵ     d  t        σ   superscript  d  3     subscript  D    g  b     superscript  e         subscript  Q    C  o  b  l  e    R   T        \frac{d\epsilon}{dt}=\frac{\sigma}{d^{3}}D_{gb}e^{-Q_{Coble}/RT}   where      σ   σ   \sigma   is the applied stress     d   d   d   is the average grain boundary diameter      D   g  b      subscript  D    g  b     D_{gb}   is the diffusion coefficient in the grain boundary      -   Q   C  o  b  l  e         subscript  Q    C  o  b  l  e      -Q_{Coble}   is the activation energy for Coble creep     R   R   R   is the molar gas constant     T   T   T   is the temperature in kelvins   Note that in Coble creep, the strain rate     d  ϵ    d  t         d  ϵ     d  t     \frac{d\epsilon}{dt}   is proportional to the applied stress   σ   σ   \sigma   ; the same relationship is found for Nabarro-Herring creep . However, the two mechanisms differ in their relationship between the strain rate and grain size   d   d   d   . In Coble creep, the strain rate is proportional to    d   -  3      superscript  d    3     d^{-3}   , whereas the strain rate in Nabarro-Herring creep is proportional to    d   -  2      superscript  d    2     d^{-2}   . Researchers commonly use these relationships to determine which mechanism is dominant in a material; by varying the grain size and measuring how the strain rate is affected, they can determine the value of   n   n   n   in       d  ϵ    d  t      α    d  n           d  ϵ     d  t    α   superscript  d  n     \frac{d\epsilon}{dt}~{}\alpha~{}d^{n}   and conclude whether Coble or Nabarro-Herring creep is dominant[1].
