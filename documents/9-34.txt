Coble creep

 Coble creep, a form of diffusion creep, is a mechanism for deformation of crystalline solids. Coble creep occurs through the diffusion of atoms in a material along the grain boundaries, which produces a net flow of material and a sliding of the grain boundaries.
Coble creep is named after Robert L. Coble, who first reported his theory of how materials creep over time in 1962 in the Journal of Applied Physics [http://scitation.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&id;;=JAPIAU000034000006001679000001&idtype;=cvips&gifs;=yes].
The strain rate in a material experiencing Coble creep is given by:


 
  where



 
  is the applied stress


 
  is the average grain boundary diameter


 
  is the diffusion coefficient in the grain boundary


 
  is the activation energy for Coble creep


 
  is the molar gas constant


 
  is the temperature in kelvins

Note that in Coble creep, the strain rate 
 
 
 
  is proportional to the applied stress 
 
 
 
 ; the same relationship is found for Nabarro-Herring creep. However, the two mechanisms differ in their relationship between the strain rate and grain size 
 
 
 
 . In Coble creep, the strain rate is proportional to 
 
 
 
 , whereas the strain rate in Nabarro-Herring creep is proportional to 
 
 
 
 . Researchers commonly use these relationships to determine which mechanism is dominant in a material; by varying the grain size and measuring how the strain rate is affected, they can determine the value of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and conclude whether Coble or Nabarro-Herring creep is dominant[1].
