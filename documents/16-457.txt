   Template:D7 honeycombs      Template:D7 honeycombs   This honeycomb is one of 77 uniform honycombs constructed by the     D  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  D   7    {\tilde{D}}_{7}    Coxeter group , all but 10 repeated in other families by extended symmetry, seen in the graph symmetry of rings in the Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams .
