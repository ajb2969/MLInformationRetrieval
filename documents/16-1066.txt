Interior reconstruction

In image reconstruction, interior reconstruction, also known as limited field of view (LFV) reconstruction, is a technique to correct truncation artifacts caused by limiting image data to a small field of view. The reconstruction focuses on an area called the region of interest (ROI). Interior reconstruction can be applied to either dental or cardiac CT images, but the concept is not limited to CT. Interior reconstruction is applied using one of various methods.
Methods
The purpose of each method is to solve for vector 
 
 
 
  in the following problem:



 Let 
 
 
 
  be the region of interest (ROI) and 
 
 
 
  be the region outside of 
 
 
 
 . Assume 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are known matrices; 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are unknown vectors of the original image, while 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are vector measurements of the responses, 
 
 
 
  being known and 
 
 
 
  unknown. Further, 
 
 
 
  is inside of the region 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
 ) and 
 
 
 
 , in the region 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
 ), is outside of region 
 
 
 
 . Also, 
 
 
 
  is inside of a region in the measurement corresponding to 
 
 
 
 . This region is denoted as 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
 ), while 
 
 
 
  is outside of the region 
 
 
 
 . This region corresponds to 
 
 
 
 , and is denoted as 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
 ).
For CT image reconstruction purposes, 
 
 
 
 .
In order to simplify the concept of the interior reconstruction, the matrices 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are applied to image reconstruction instead of using complicated operators.
The first interior reconstruction method under consideration below is the extrapolation method. That is a local tomography method which eliminates the truncation artifacts but introduces another kind of artifact, i.e. "bowl effect". Then we examine an improvement called the adaptive extrapolation method. The iterative extrapolation method below also improves the reconstruction results. In some special cases, the exact reconstruction can be found for the interior reconstruction. The local inverse method explained below modifies the local tomography method and perhaps can improve the reconstruction result of the local tomography. Further, the iterative reconstruction method can be applied to interior reconstruction. Among the above methods, extrapolation is often applied.

  are known matrices; 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are unknown vectors; 
 
 
 
  is a known vector; 
 
 
 
  is an unknown vector. We desire to know the vector 
 
 
 
 . Here it is assumed that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the original image, while 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are measurements of the responses. Vector 
 
 
 
  is at the inside of the region 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
 ) where 
 
 
 
  is also called the Region of interest (ROI). Vector 
 
 
 
  is at the outside of the region 
 
 
 
 . The outside region is referred as 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
 ) and 
 
 
 
  is at the inside of a region in the measurement corresponding to 
 
 
 
 . This region is denoted as 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
 ). Also, the region of vector 
 
 
 
 , which is at the outside of the region 
 
 
 
 , corresponds to 
 
 
 
  and is denoted as 
 
 
 
 , (
 
 
 
 ). In CT image reconstruction, it has


 
  The question is: What is the solution of this problem in the region of 
 
 
 
 ?
In order to simplify the concept of the interior reconstruction, the matrices

The response in the outside region can be a guess 
 
 
 
 ; for example, assume it is

In the above formula a simple solution of 
 
 
 
  is obtained; it is written as 
 
 
 
 . This is called the extrapolation method. The result is dependent on how good the guess function or extrapolation function 
 
 
 
  is. A frequent choice is


 
  at the boundary of the two regions. The examples of the extrapolation method can be seen in the cited references 1 2 3 .4 The extrapolation method is often combined with a priori knowledge. 5 6
(There is also a fast extrapolation method to reduce calculation time, shown below.)
Adaptive extrapolation method
Assume a rough solution, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , is obtained from the extrapolation method described above. The response in the outside region 
 
 
 
  can be calculated as follows:



The reconstructed image can be calculated as following,

 , is obtained from the extrapolation method described above.



or



The reconstruction can be obtained as following,

Local tomography
Local tomography is also referred as lambda tomography. The filter used in local tomography is very short.1314
Local inverse method
The local inverse method extends the concept of local tomography. The response in the outside region can be calculated as follows:



consider the generalized inverse 
 
 
 
  satisfying

  Hence,



The above equation can be solved as



Considering

 , i.e.



The solution can be simplified as



The matrix 
 
 
 
  is referred to as the local inverse of a matrix 
 
 
 
  corresponding to 
 
 
 
 . This method is referred to as the local inverse method.15
Iterative reconstruction method
Here a goal function is defined and this method Iteratively achieves the goal. If the goal function can be some kind of normal, this is known as a minimal norm method. We have

where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are weighting constants of the minimization and 
 
 
 
  is some kind of norm. The often used norms are 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  or total variation (TV) norm, or some combination of the above norms. An example of this method is also referred to as the projection onto convex sets (POCS) method. 16 17
Analytical solution
In special situations, the interior reconstruction can be obtained as an analytical solution. The solution of 
 
 
 
  is exact in such cases.
18 19 20
Fast extrapolation
The extrapolated data often convolutes to a kernel function. After data is extrapolated, the size of the data is increased N times, where N = 2 ~ 3. If this data needs to be convoluted to a known kernel function, the numerical calculations will increase log(N)·N times even with the fast Fourier transform (FFT). There exists an algorithm; it analytically calculates the contribution from the part of the extrapolated data. The calculation time can be omitted compared to the original convolution calculation. Hence with this algorithm the calculation of a convolution using the extrapolated data is not increased noticeably. This is referred to as the fast extrapolation.21
Comparison of the above interior reconstruction methods

The extrapolation method is suitable to the situation where





 
  and 
 
 



i.e. a small truncation artifacts situation.
 


The adaptive extrapolation method is suitable to the situation where





 
  and 
 
 



i.e. a normal truncation artifacts situation. This method also offers a rough solution for the exterior region.
 


The iterative extrapolation method is suitable to the situation where





 
  and 
 
 



i.e. a normal truncation artifacts situation. This method gets better interior reconstruction compared to the adaptive reconstruction, but at the price of totally missing the result in the exterior region.
 


The local tomography is suitable to the situation where





 
  and 
 
 



i.e. a largest truncation artifacts situation. There are no truncation artifacts for this method. However there is a fixed error in the reconstruction. The error is not dependent on the value of 
 
 
 
 .
 


The local inverse method is the same as local tomography. It is suitable to the situation where





 
  and 
 
 



i.e. a largest truncation artifacts situation. There are no truncation artifacts for this method. However there is a fixed error in the reconstruction. The error is not dependent on the value of 
 
 
 
 . The error is perhaps smaller than with local tomography.
 


The iterative reconstruction method achieves a good result, but at the price of huge calculations.


The analytic method achieves the exact result, but it is only functional for some special situations.


The fast extrapolation method can get the same results as the other extrapolation methods. It can be applied to the above interior reconstruction methods to reduce the calculation.
