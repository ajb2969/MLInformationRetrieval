Unitary transformation

In mathematics, a unitary transformation is a transformation that preserves the inner product: the inner product of two vectors before the transformation is equal to their inner product after the transformation.
Formal definition
More precisely, a unitary transformation is an isomorphism between two Hilbert spaces. In other words, a unitary transformation is a bijective function
$$U:H_1\to H_2\,$$
where $H_1$ and $H_2$ are Hilbert spaces, such that
$$\langle Ux, Uy \rangle_{H_2} = \langle x, y \rangle_{H_1}$$
for all $x$ and $y$ in $H_1$.
Properties
A unitary transformation is an isometry, as one can see by setting $x=y$ in this formula.
Unitary operator
In the case when $H_1$ and $H_2$ are the same space, a unitary transformation is an automorphism of that Hilbert space, and then it is also called a unitary operator.
Antiunitary transformation
A closely related notion is that of antiunitary transformation, which is a bijective function
$$U:H_1\to H_2\,$$
between two complex Hilbert spaces such that
$$\langle Ux, Uy \rangle = \overline{\langle x, y \rangle}=\langle y, x \rangle$$
for all $x$ and $y$ in $H_1$, where the horizontal bar represents the complex conjugate.
