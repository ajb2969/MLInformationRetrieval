   Formylmethionine deformylase      Formylmethionine deformylase   In enzymology , a formylmethionine deformylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-formyl-L-methionine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formate + L-methionine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-formyl-L-methionine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are formate and L-methionine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-formyl-L-methionine amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 14 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
