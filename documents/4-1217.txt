   VO2 max      VO2 max    VO 2 max (also maximal oxygen consumption , maximal oxygen uptake , peak oxygen uptake or maximal aerobic capacity ) is the maximum rate of oxygen consumption as measured during incremental exercise , most typically on a motorized treadmill. 1 2 Maximal oxygen consumption reflects the aerobic physical fitness of the individual, and is an important determinant of their endurance capacity during prolonged, sub-maximal exercise . The name is derived from V - volume , O 2 - oxygen , max - maximum.  VO 2 max is expressed either as an absolute rate in (for example) litres of oxygen per minute (L/min) or as a relative rate in (for example) millilitres of oxygen per kilogram of body mass per minute (e.g., mL/(kg·min)). The latter expression is often used to compare the performance of endurance sports athletes. However, VO 2 max generally does not vary linearly with body mass, either among individuals within a species or among species, 3 4 so comparisons of the performance capacities of individuals or species that differ in body size must be done with appropriate statistical procedures, such as analysis of covariance .  Measuring VO 2 max  Accurately measuring VO 2 max involves a physical effort sufficient in duration and intensity to fully tax the aerobic energy system. In general clinical and athletic testing, this usually involves a graded exercise test (either on a treadmill or on a cycle ergometer ) in which exercise intensity is progressively increased while measuring ventilation and oxygen and carbon dioxide concentration of the inhaled and exhaled air. VO 2 max is reached when oxygen consumption remains at steady state despite an increase in workload.  Fick equation  VO 2 max is properly defined by the Fick equation :         VO  2    max   =   Q  ×   (     C  a    O  2    -    C  v    O  2     )           subscript  VO  2   max     Q       subscript  normal-C  normal-a    subscript  normal-O  2       subscript  normal-C  normal-v    subscript  normal-O  2        \mathrm{VO_{2}\;max}=Q\times\ (\mathrm{C_{a}O_{2}}-\mathrm{C_{v}O_{2}})   , when these values are obtained during an exertion at a maximal effort.    where Q is the cardiac output of the heart, C a O 2 is the arterial oxygen content, and C v O 2 is the venous oxygen content.       (C a O 2 – C v O 2 ) is also known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference . 5      Estimation of VO 2 max  Tests measuring VO 2 max can be dangerous in individuals who are not considered normal healthy subjects, as any problems with the respiratory and cardiovascular systems will be greatly exacerbated in clinically ill patients. Thus, many protocols for estimating VO 2 max have been developed for those for whom a traditional VO 2 max test would be too risky. These generally are similar to a VO 2 max test, but do not reach the maximum of the respiratory and cardiovascular systems and are called sub-maximal tests .  Uth–Sørensen–Overgaard–Pedersen estimation  Another estimate of VO 2 max for humans, based on maximum and resting heart rates, was created by a group of researchers from Denmark. 6 It is given by:         VO  2    max   ≈    15    m  L      k  g   *  m   i  n     *    HR  max    HR  rest            subscript  VO  2   max       15      m  L         k  g   m   i  n        subscript  HR  max    subscript  HR  rest       \mathrm{VO_{2}\;max}\approx{15{mL\over{kg*min}}*{\mbox{HR}_{\mathrm{max}}\over%
 \mbox{HR}_{\mathrm{rest}}}}     This equation uses maximum heart rate (HR max ) and resting heart rate (HR rest ) to estimate VO 2 max.  Cooper test  Kenneth H. Cooper conducted a study for the United States Air Force in the late 1960s. One of the results of this was the Cooper test in which the distance covered running in 12 minutes is measured. Based on the measured distance, an estimate of VO 2 max [in mL/(kg·min)] is: 7         VO  2    max   ≈     d  12   -  504.9   44.73          subscript  VO  2   max        subscript  d  12   504.9   44.73     \mathrm{VO_{2}\;max}\approx{d_{12}-504.9\over 44.73}     where d 12 is distance (in metres) covered in 12 minutes, alternatively         VO  2    max   ≈    (    35.97  *  d   m  i  l  e   s  12    )   -  11.29          subscript  VO  2   max         35.97  d   m  i  l  e   subscript  s  12    11.29     \mathrm{VO_{2}\;max}\approx{(35.97*dmiles_{12})-11.29}     where d 12 is distance (in miles) covered in 12 minutes,  Multi-stage fitness test  There are several other reliable tests and VO 2 max calculators to estimate VO 2 max, most notably the multi-stage fitness test (or beep test), based on the research paper by Leger and Lambert, "A Maximal Multi-Stage 20-m Shuttle Run Test to predict VO2 Max".  Rockport Fitness Walking Test  Estimation of VO2 max from a timed one mile track walk, gender, age, body weight and heart rate, at the end of the mile. 8        VO  2    max  ≈  132.853  -   (  0.0769  ×  body weight (lbs)  )   -   (  0.3877  ×  age  )   +   (  6.3150  ×  gender   [  female  =  0  ,  male  =  1  ]   )   -   (  3.2649  ×  mile time  )   -   (  0.1565  ×  heart rate on completion  )      fragments   subscript  VO  2   max   132.853    fragments  normal-(  0.0769   body weight (lbs)  normal-)     fragments  normal-(  0.3877   age  normal-)     fragments  normal-(  6.3150   gender   fragments  normal-[  female   0  normal-,  male   1  normal-]   normal-)     fragments  normal-(  3.2649   mile time  normal-)     fragments  normal-(  0.1565   heart rate on completion  normal-)     \mathrm{VO_{2}\;max}\approx 132.853-(0.0769\times\text{body weight (lbs)})-(0.%

 ])-(3.2649\times\text{mile time})-(0.1565\times\text{heart rate on completion})     VO 2 max levels  “Maximal oxygen uptake (VO 2 max) is widely accepted as the single best measure of cardiovascular fitness and maximal aerobic power. Absolute values of VO 2 max are typically 40-60% higher in men than in women.” 9  The average untrained healthy male will have a VO 2 max of approximately 35–40 mL/(kg·min). 10 11 The average untrained healthy female will score a VO 2 max of approximately 27–31 mL/(kg·min). 12 These scores can improve with training and decrease with age, though the degree of trainability also varies very widely: conditioning may double VO 2 max in some individuals, and will never improve it in others. In one study, 10% of participants showed no benefit after completing a 20-week conditioning program, although the other 90% of the test subjects all showed substantial improvements in fitness to varying degree. 13 14  In sports where endurance is an important component in performance, such as cycling , rowing , cross-country skiing , swimming and running , world-class athletes typically have high VO 2 maxima. Elite male runners can consume up to 85 mL/(kg·min), and female elite runners can consume about 77 mL/(kg·min). 15 Five time Tour de France winner Miguel Indurain is reported to have had a VO 2 max of 88.0 at his peak, while cross-country skier Bjørn Dæhlie measured at 96 mL/(kg·min). 16 Dæhlie's result was achieved out of season, and physiologist Erlend Hem who was responsible for the testing stated that he would not discount the possibility of the skier passing 100 mL/(kg·min) at his absolute peak. Norwegian cyclist Oskar Svendsen is thought to have recorded the highest VO 2 max of 97.5 mL/(kg·min), a "sensational" value in itself, made more remarkable by his young age (18 years old at the time). 17 To put this into perspective, thoroughbred horses have a VO 2 max of around 180 mL/(kg·min). Siberian dogs running in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race have VO 2 max values as high as 240 mL/(kg·min). 18  The highest values in absolute terms for humans are often found in rowers, as their much greater bulk makes up for a slightly lower VO 2 max per kg. Elite oarsmen measured in 1984 had VO 2 max values of 6.1±0.6 L/min and oarswomen 4.1±0.4 L/min. 19 Rowers are interested in both absolute values of VO 2 max and in lung capacity, and the fact that they are measured in similar units means that the two are often confused. British rower Sir Matthew Pinsent is variously reported to have had a VO 2 of 7.5l/min 20 or 8.5l/min, although the latter may represent confusion with his lung capacity of 8.5 litres. 21 New Zealand sculler Rob Waddell has one of the highest absolute VO2 max levels ever tested. 22  Factors affecting VO 2 max  The factors affecting VO 2 are often divided into supply and demand. 23 Supply is the transport of oxygen from the lungs to the mitochondria (including lung diffusion, stroke volume, blood volume, and capillary density of the skeletal muscle) while demand is the rate at which the mitochondria can reduce oxygen in the process of oxidative phosphorylation . 24 Of these, the supply factor is often considered to be the limiting one. 25 26 However, it has also been argued that while trained subjects probably are supply limited, untrained subjects can indeed have a demand limitation. 27  Tim Noakes , a professor of exercise and sports science at the University of Cape Town , describes a number of factors that may affect VO 2 max: age, sex , fitness and training, changes in altitude , and action of the ventilatory muscles. 28 Noakes also asserts that VO 2 max is a relatively poor predictor of performance in runners due to variations in running economy and fatigue resistance during prolonged exercise. 29  Cardiac output, pulmonary diffusion capacity, oxygen carrying capacity, and other peripheral limitations like muscle diffusion capacity, mitochondrial enzymes, and capillary density are all examples of VO 2 max determinants. The body works as a system. If one of these factor is sub-par, then the whole system loses its normal capacity to function properly. 30  The drug erythropoietin (EPO) can boost VO 2 max by a significant amount in both humans and other mammals. 31 This makes EPO attractive to athletes in endurance sports , such as professional cycling. By 1998 it had become widespread in cycling and led to the Festina affair 32 33 as well as being mentioned ubiquitously in the USADA 2012 report on the US Postal team. 34  Greg LeMond has suggested establishing a baseline for riders' VO 2 max (and other attributes) to detect abnormal performance increases. 35  See also   Anaerobic exercise  Arteriovenous oxygen difference  Cardiorespiratory fitness  Comparative physiology  VDOT  Oxygen pulse  Respirometry  Training effect  vVO 2 max  Running economy   References  External links   VO 2 max Calculator - the Rockport Walking Test  So What Exactly is VO2?

A large lung capacity appears to be a particular advantage for rowing as it allows a rower to row more strokes at one breath per stroke. ↩  ↩  ↩    ↩  ↩  Noakes, Tim. 2003. The Lore of Running.
