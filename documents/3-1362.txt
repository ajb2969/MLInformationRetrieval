Berry–Esseen theorem
In [[probability theory]], the [[central limit theorem]] states th
 at, under certain circumstances, the probability distribution of the scaled mean of a random sample converges to a normal distribution as the sample size increases to infinity. Under stronger assumptions, the Berry–Esseen theorem, or Berry–Esseen inequality, gives a more quantitative result, because it also specifies the rate at which this convergence takes place by giving a bound on the maximal error of approximation between the normal distribution and the true distribution of the scaled sample mean. The approximation is measured by the Kolmogorov–Smirnov distance. In the case of independent samples, the convergence rate is , where 
 
 
 
  is the sample size, and the constant is estimated in terms of the third absolute normalized moments.
Statement of the theorem
Statements of the theorem vary, as it was independently discovered by two mathematicians, Andrew C. Berry (in 1941) and Carl-Gustav Esseen (1942), who then, along with other authors, refined it repeatedly over subsequent decades.
Identically distributed summands
One version, sacrificing generality somewhat for the sake of clarity, is the following:

There exists a positive constant C such that if X1, X2, ..., are i.i.d. random variables with E(X1) = 0, E(X12) = σ2 > 0, and E(|X1|3) = ρ Y_n = {X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n \over n}
 
the sample mean, with Fn the cumulative distribution function of
 
 



and Φ the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution, then for all x and n,
 
 




 That is: given a sequence of independent and identically-distributed random variables, each having mean zero and positive variance, if additionally the third absolute moment is finite, then the cumulative distribution functions of the standardized sample mean and the standard normal distribution differ (vertically, on a graph) by no more than the specified amount. Note that the approximation error for all n (and hence the limiting rate of convergence for indefinite n sufficiently large) is bounded by the order of n−1/2.
Calculated values of the constant C have decreased markedly over the years, from the original value of 7.59 by , to 0.7882 by , then 0.7655 by , then 0.7056 by , then 0.7005 by , then 0.5894 by , then 0.5129 by , then 0.4785 by . The detailed review can be found in the papers , . The best estimate , C \sup_{x\in\mathbb R}\left|F_n(x) - \Phi(x)\right| \le {0.33554 (\rho+0.415\sigma^3)\over \sigma^3\,\sqrt{n}}, due to , since σ3 ≤ ρ and 0.33554 · 1.415 3, then the estimate


 
  which is also proved in , gives an even tighter upper estimate.
proved that the constant also satisfies the lower bound



Non-identically distributed summands

Let X1, X2, ..., be independent random variables with E(Xi) = 0, E(Xi2) = σi2 > 0, and E(|Xi|3) = ρi S_n = {X_1 + X_2 + \cdots + X_n \over \sqrt{\sigma_1^2+\sigma_2^2+\cdots+\sigma_n^2} }
 
be the normalized n-th partial sum. Denote Fn the cdf of Sn, and Φ the cdf of the standard normal distribution. For the sake of convenience denote
 
 



In 1941, Andrew C. Berry proved that for all n there exists an absolute constant C1 such that

i\le n}\frac{\rho_i}{\sigma_i^2}.

Independently, in 1942, Carl-Gustav Esseen proved that for all n there exists an absolute constant C0 such that
 
 



where
 
 




It is easy to make sure that ψ0≤ψ1. Due to this circumstance inequality (3) is conventionally called the Berry–Esseen inequality, and the quantity ψ0 is called the Lyapunov fraction of the third order. Moreover, in the case where the summands X1,... Xn have identical distributions








and thus the bounds stated by inequalities (1), (2) and (3) coincide.
Regarding C0, obviously, the lower bound established by  remains valid:



The upper bounds for C0 were subsequently lowered from the original estimate 7.59 due to  to (we mention the recent results only) 0.9051 due to , 0.7975 due to , 0.7915 due to , 0.6379 and 0.5606 due to  and .  the best estimate is 0.5600 obtained by .
