   Prime integer topology      Prime integer topology   In mathematics, and especially general topology , the prime integer topology and the relatively prime integer topology are examples of topologies on the set of positive whole numbers , i.e. the set }. 1 To give the set Z + a topology means to say which subsets of Z + are "open", and to do so in a way that the following axioms are met: 2   The union of open sets is an open set.  The finite intersection of open sets is an open set.  Z + and the empty set ∅ are open sets.   Construction  Given two positive integers , define the following congruence class :        U  a    (  b  )    =   {    b  +   n  a    ∈    𝐙  +     |   n  ∈  𝐙   }          subscript  U  a   b    conditional-set      b    n  a     superscript  𝐙       n  𝐙      U_{a}(b)=\{b+na\in\mathbf{Z}^{+}\,|\,n\in\mathbf{Z}\}     Then the relatively prime integer topology is the topology generated from the basis      𝔅  =   {    U  a    (  b  )    |     a  ,  b   ∈   𝐙  +    ,    (  a  ,  b  )   =  1    }       𝔅   conditional-set     subscript  U  a   b    formulae-sequence     a  b    superscript  𝐙        a  b   1       \mathfrak{B}=\{U_{a}(b)\,|\,a,b\in\mathbf{Z}^{+},(a,b)=1\}     and the prime integer topology is the sub-topology generated from the sub-basis      𝔓  =   {    U  p    (  b  )    |     p  ,  b   ∈   𝐙  +    ,   p  is prime    }       𝔓   conditional-set     subscript  U  p   b    formulae-sequence     p  b    superscript  𝐙       p  is prime       \mathfrak{P}=\{U_{p}(b)\,|\,p,b\in\mathbf{Z}^{+},p\text{ is prime}\}     The set of positive integers with the relatively prime integer topology or with the prime integer topology are examples of topological spaces that are Hausdorff but not regular . 3  See also   Fürstenberg's proof of the infinitude of primes   References  it:Topologia degli interi equispaziati "  Category:General topology     ↩
