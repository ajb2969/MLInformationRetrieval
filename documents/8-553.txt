   Ohnesorge number      Ohnesorge number   The Ohnesorge number ( Oh ) is a dimensionless number that relates the viscous forces to inertial and surface tension forces. The number was defined by Wolfgang von Ohnesorge in his 1936 doctoral thesis. 1  It is defined as:      Oh  =   μ    ρ  σ  L     =    We   Re   ∼   viscous forces    inertia  ⋅  surface tension           Oh    μ      ρ  σ  L              We   Re     similar-to      viscous forces     normal-⋅  inertia  surface tension        \mathrm{Oh}=\frac{\mu}{\sqrt{\rho\sigma L}}=\frac{\sqrt{\mathrm{We}}}{\mathrm{%
 Re}}\sim\frac{\mbox{viscous forces}}{\sqrt{{\mbox{inertia}}\cdot{\mbox{surface%
  tension}}}}     Where   μ is the liquid viscosity  ρ is the liquid density  σ is the surface tension  L is the characteristic length scale (typically drop diameter)  Re is the Reynolds number  We is the Weber number   Applications  The Ohnesorge number for a 3 mm diameter rain drop is typically ~0.002. Larger Ohnesorge numbers indicate a greater influence of the viscosity.  This is often used to relate to free surface fluid dynamics such as dispersion of liquids in gases and in spray technology. 2 3  In inkjet printing , liquids whose Ohnesorge number is larger than 0.1 and smaller than 1 are jettable. 4 5  See also   Laplace number - There is an inverse relationship,    Oh  =   1  /   La        Oh    1    La      \mathrm{Oh}=1/\sqrt{\mathrm{La}}   , between the Laplace number and the Ohnesorge number. It is more historically correct to use the Ohnesorge number, but often mathematically neater to use the Laplace number .
