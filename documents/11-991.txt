   Tartronate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase      Tartronate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase   In enzymology , a tartronate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sinapoyl-CoA + 2-hydroxymalonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + sinapoyltartronate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sinapoyl-CoA and 2-hydroxymalonate , whereas its two products are CoA and sinapoyltartronate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sinapoyl-CoA:2-hydroxymalonate O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase . Other names in common use include tartronate sinapoyltransferase , and hydroxycinnamoyl-coenzyme-A:tartronate hydroxycinnamoyltransferase .
