   Draft:Contraction theorem      Draft:Contraction theorem   Castelnuovo's contraction theorem  In mathematics , especially in the classification theory of algebraic surfaces , Castelnuovo's contraction theorem provides an effective way to construct the minimal model of a given smooth algebraic surface.  More precisely, let $X$ be a smooth projective surface over $\mathbb{C}$ and $C$ a −1- curve on $X$ (which means a smooth rational curve of self-intersection number −1), then there exists a morphism from $X$ to another smooth projective surface $Y$ such that the curve $C$ has been contracted to one point $P$ , and moreover this morphism is an isomorphism outside $C$ (i.e., $X\setminus C$ is isomorphic with $Y\setminus P$ ).  This contraction morphism is sometimes called a blowdown , which is the inverse operation of blowup . We also call curve $C$ exceptional curve of the first kind.
