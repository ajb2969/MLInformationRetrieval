   DeWitt notation      DeWitt notation   Physics often deals with classical models where the dynamical variables are a collection of functions { φ α } α over a d-dimensional space/spacetime manifold  M where α is the " flavor " index. This involves functionals over the φ 's, functional derivatives , functional integrals , etc. From a functional point of view this is equivalent to working with an infinite-dimensional smooth manifold where its points are an assignment of a function for each α , and the procedure is in analogy with differential geometry where the coordinates for a point x of the manifold M are φ α ( x ).  In the DeWitt notation (named after theoretical physicist  Bryce DeWitt ), φ α ( x ) is written as φ i where i is now understood as an index covering both α and x .  So, given a smooth functional A , A , i stands for the functional derivative        A   ,  i     [  ϕ  ]      =  def      δ   δ   ϕ  α    (  x  )     A   [  ϕ  ]        superscript   def      subscript  A   fragments  normal-,  i     delimited-[]  ϕ        δ    δ   superscript  ϕ  α   x    A   delimited-[]  ϕ      A_{,i}[\phi]\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\delta}{\delta\phi^{\alpha}(x)%

Alternatively,        A  i     B  i       =  def      ∫  M     ∑  α     A  α    (  x  )    B  α    (  x  )    d  d   x         superscript   def      superscript  A  i    subscript  B  i      subscript   M     subscript   α      superscript  A  α   x   subscript  B  α   x   superscript  d  d   x       A^{i}B_{i}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \int_{M}\sum_{\alpha}A^{\alpha}(x)B_{%
