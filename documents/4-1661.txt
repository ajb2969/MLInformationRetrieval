   Conserved current      Conserved current   In physics a conserved current is a current,    j  Œº     superscript  j  Œº    j^{\mu}   , that satisfies the continuity equation       ‚àÇ  Œº    j  Œº    =  0        subscript   Œº    superscript  j  Œº    0    \partial_{\mu}j^{\mu}=0   . The continuity equation represents a conservation law, hence the name.  Indeed, integrating the continuity equation over a volume   V   V   V   , large enough to have no net currents through its surface, leads to the conservation law         ‚àÇ   ‚àÇ  t    Q   =   0    ,             t    Q   0    {\partial\over\partial t}Q=0\;,   where    Q  =    ‚à´  V     j  0   d  V        Q    subscript   V      superscript  j  0   d  V      Q=\int_{V}j^{0}dV   is the conserved quantity.  In gauge theories the gauge fields couple to conserved currents. For example, the electromagnetic field couples to the conserved electric current .  Conserved quantities and symmetries  Conserved current is the flow of the canonical conjugate of a quantity possessing a continuous  translational symmetry . The continuity equation for the conserved current is a statement of a conservation law . Conserved current is a term used to scientifically describe the current which flows within parallel circuits.  Examples of canonical conjugate quantities are:   Time and energy - the continuous translational symmetry of time implies the conservation of energy .  Space and momentum - the continuous translational symmetry of space implies the conservation of momentum  Space and angular momentum - the continuous rotational symmetry of space implies the conservation of angular momentum  Wave function  phase and electric charge - the continuous phase angle symmetry of the wave function implies the conservation of electric charge   Conserved currents play an extremely important role in theoretical physics , because Noether's theorem connects the existence of a conserved current to the existence of a symmetry of some quantity in the system under study. In practical terms, all conserved currents are Noether currents , as the existence of a conserved current implies the existence of a symmetry. Conserved currents play an important role in the theory of partial differential equations , as the existence of a conserved current points to the existence of constants of motion , which are required to define a foliation and thus an integrable system . The conservation law is expressed as the vanishing of a 4- divergence , where the Noether charge forms the zeroth component of the 4-current .  Conserved currents in electromagnetism  The conservation of charge , for example, in the notation of Maxwell's equations ,         ‚àÇ  œÅ    ‚àÇ  t    +   ‚àá  ‚ãÖ  ùêâ    =  0            œÅ     t     normal-‚ãÖ  normal-‚àá  ùêâ    0    \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot\mathbf{J}=0     where:  œÅ is the free electric charge density (in units of C/m¬≥)  J is the current density :   J =   œÅ   œÅ   \rho    v    v is the velocity of the charges.  The equation would apply equally to masses (or other conserved quantities), where the word mass is substituted for the words electric charge above.
