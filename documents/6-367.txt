   Solenoid (mathematics)      Solenoid (mathematics)    This page discusses a class of topological groups. For the wrapped loop of wire, see Solenoid .    In mathematics , a solenoid is a compact  connected  topological space (i.e. a continuum ) that may be obtained as the inverse limit of an inverse system of topological groups and continuous  homomorphisms   ( S i , f i ), f i : S i +1 → S i , i ≥ 0,   where each S i is a circle and f i is the map that uniformly wraps the circle S i +1  n i times ( n i ≥ 2) around the circle S i . This construction can be carried out geometrically in the three-dimensional Euclidean space  R 3 . A solenoid is a one-dimensional homogeneous indecomposable continuum that has the structure of a compact topological group .  In the special case where all n i have the same value n , so that the inverse system is determined by the multiplication by n self map of the circle, solenoids were first introduced by Vietoris for n = 2 and by van Dantzig for an arbitrary n . Such a solenoid arises as a one-dimensional expanding attractor , or Smale–Williams attractor , and forms an important example in the theory of hyperbolic  dynamical systems .  Geometric construction and the Smale–Williams attractor  Each solenoid may be constructed as the intersection of a nested system of embedded solid tori in R 3 .  Fix a sequence of natural numbers { n i }, n i ≥ 2. Let T 0 = S 1 × D be a solid torus . For each i ≥ 0, choose a solid torus T i +1 that is wrapped longitudinally n i times inside the solid torus T i . Then their intersection      Λ  =    ⋂   i  ≥  0     T  i        normal-Λ    subscript     i  0     subscript  T  i      \Lambda=\bigcap_{i\geq 0}T_{i}     is homeomorphic to the solenoid constructed as the inverse limit of the system of circles with the maps determined by the sequence { n i }.  Here is a variant of this construction isolated by Stephen Smale as an example of an expanding attractor in the theory of smooth dynamical systems. Denote the angular coordinate on the circle S 1 by t (it is defined mod 2π) and consider the complex coordinate z on the two-dimensional unit disk  D . Let f be the map of the solid torus T = S 1 × D into itself given by the explicit formula        f   (  t  ,  z  )    =   (   2  t   ,      1  4    z   +     1  2     e   i  t      )    .        f   t  z       2  t         1  4   z       1  2    superscript  e    i  t         f(t,z)=\left(2t,\tfrac{1}{4}z+\tfrac{1}{2}e^{it}\right).     This map is a smooth embedding of T into itself that preserves the foliation by meridional disks (the constants 1/2 and 1/4 are somewhat arbitrary, but it is essential that 1/4 i is the image of T under the i th iteration of the map f . This set is a one-dimensional (in the sense of topological dimension ) attractor , and the dynamics of f on Λ has the following interesting properties:   meridional disks are the stable manifolds , each of which intersects Λ over a Cantor set  periodic points of f are dense in Λ  the map f is topologically transitive on Λ   General theory of solenoids and expanding attractors, not necessarily one-dimensional, was developed by R. F. Williams and involves a projective system of infinitely many copies of a compact branched manifold in place of the circle, together with an expanding self- immersion .  Pathological properties  Solenoids are compact  metrizable spaces that are connected , but not locally connected or path connected . This is reflected in their pathological behavior with respect to various homology theories , in contrast with the standard properties of homology for simplicial complexes . In Čech homology , one can construct a non-exact long homology sequence using a solenoid. In Steenrod -style homology theories, 1 the 0th homology group of a solenoid may have a fairly complicated structure, even though a solenoid is a connected space.
