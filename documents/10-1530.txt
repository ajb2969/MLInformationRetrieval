   N-hydroxy-2-acetamidofluorene reductase      N-hydroxy-2-acetamidofluorene reductase   In enzymology , a N-hydroxy-2-acetamidofluorene reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-acetamidofluorene + NAD(P)+ + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-hydroxy-2-acetamidofluorene + NAD(P)H + H +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are 2-acetamidofluorene , NAD + , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are N-hydroxy-2-acetamidofluorene , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-acetamidofluorene:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include N-hydroxy-2-acetylaminofluorene reductase , and NAD(P)H:N-hydroxy-2-acetamidofluorene N-oxidoreductase .
