   Virial mass      Virial mass   In astronomy, the virial mass has different meanings depending on the context.  In the context of dark matter halos of galaxies or galaxy clusters , virial mass refers to the mass within the virial radius     r  vir     subscript  r  vir    r_{\rm vir}   , a radius within which a spherical "top hat" density perturbation destined to become a galaxy is collapsing. This radius is defined as where    ρ  c     subscript  ρ  c    \rho_{c}   is the critical density of the universe. 1 (Sometimes in the definition,     ρ  M   =    Ω  M    ρ  c         subscript  ρ  M      subscript  normal-Ω  M    subscript  ρ  c      \rho_{M}=\Omega_{M}\rho_{c}   is replaced with the mean  density of matter,     Ω  M   ≃  0.27     similar-to-or-equals   subscript  normal-Ω  M   0.27    \Omega_{M}\simeq 0.27   , where, at the present day,    Δ  c     subscript  normal-Δ  c    \Delta_{c}   according to data fitted to the Lambda-CDM model .) The virial mass is the mass within this radius and hence is a reasonable measure of the total mass inside a dark matter halo, because beyond that radius the halo blends into the background matter in the universe. This definition is not universal, however, as the exact value of     Δ  c   =  200       subscript  normal-Δ  c   200    \Delta_{c}=200   depends on the cosmology – in practice, to improve communication, it is sometimes simply assumed that    r  vir     subscript  r  vir    r_{\rm vir}   and hence this is sometimes denoted as    ρ  c     subscript  ρ  c    \rho_{c}        ↩
