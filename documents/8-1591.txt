Parry–Daniels map

In mathematics, the Parry–Daniels map is a function studied in the context of dynamical systems. Typical questions concern the existence of an invariant or ergodic measure for the map.
It is named after the English mathematician Bill Parry and the British statistician Henry Daniels, who independently studied the map in papers published in 1962.
