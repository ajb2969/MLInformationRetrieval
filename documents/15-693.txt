   Kinetic Euclidean minimum spanning tree      Kinetic Euclidean minimum spanning tree   A kinetic Euclidean minimum spanning tree is a kinetic data structure that maintains the Euclidean minimum spanning tree (EMST) of a set P of n points that are moving continuously.  For the set of points P in 2-dimensional space, there are two kinetic algorithms for maintenance of the EMST.  Rahmati and Zarei 1 build a kinetic data structure based on the kinetic Delaunay triangulation to handle updates to the EMST in polylog time per event. Their kinetic data structure handles    O   (   n  *  m   )       O    n  m     O(n*m)   events, where m is the number of all changes to the Delaunay triangulation of the moving points. Their kinetic approach can work well for maintenance of the minimum spanning tree (MST) of a planar graph whose edge weights are changing as a continuous function of time.  Abam, Rahmati, and Zarei 2 provide a significant improvement on exact kinetic maintenance on the Euclidean minimum spanning tree . Their kinetic data structure handles a nearly cubic number of events.  References  "  Category:Kinetic data structures
