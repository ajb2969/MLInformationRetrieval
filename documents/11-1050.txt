   Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate synthase      Pyridoxine 5'-phosphate synthase   In enzymology , a pyridoxine 5'-phosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate + 3-amino-2-oxopropyl phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyridoxine 5'-phosphate + phosphate + 2 H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate and 3-amino-2-oxopropyl phosphate , whereas its 3 products are pyridoxine 5'-phosphate , phosphate , and H 2 O .  Classification  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring nitrogenous groups transferring other nitrogenous groups.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-deoxy-D-xylulose-5-phosphate:3-amino-2-oxopropyl phosphate 3-amino-2-oxopropyltransferase (phosphate-hydrolysing; cyclizing) . Other names in common use include pyridoxine 5-phosphate phospho lyase , PNP synthase , and PdxJ .  Biological role  This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism .
