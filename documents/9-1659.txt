   Weyl integral      Weyl integral   In mathematics , the Weyl integral is an operator defined, as an example of fractional calculus , on functions f on the unit circle having integral 0 and a Fourier series . In other words there is a Fourier series for f of the form       ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     a  n    e   i  n  θ         superscript   subscript     n             subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i  n  θ       \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}a_{n}e^{in\theta}     with a 0 = 0.  Then the Weyl integral operator of order s is defined on Fourier series by       ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞      (   i  n   )   s    a  n    e   i  n  θ         superscript   subscript     n             superscript    i  n   s    subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i  n  θ       \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}(in)^{s}a_{n}e^{in\theta}     where this is defined. Here s can take any real value, and for integer values k of s the series expansion is the expected k -th derivative, if k > 0, or (− k )th indefinite integral normalized by integration from θ = 0.  The condition a 0 = 0 here plays the obvious role of excluding the need to consider division by zero. The definition is due to Hermann Weyl (1917).
