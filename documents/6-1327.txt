   Compression theorem      Compression theorem   In computational complexity theory the compression theorem is an important theorem about the complexity of computable functions .  The theorem states that there exists no largest complexity class , with computable boundary, which contains all computable functions.  Compression theorem  Given a Gödel numbering    φ   φ   \varphi   of the computable functions and a Blum complexity measure    Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   where a complexity class for a boundary function   f   f   f   is defined as        C   (  f  )    :=   {    φ  i   ∈   𝐑   (  1  )     |     (    ∀  ∞   x   )    Φ  i    (  x  )    ≤   f   (  x  )     }    .     assign    normal-C  f    conditional-set     subscript  φ  i    superscript  𝐑  1          superscript  for-all    x    subscript  normal-Φ  i   x     f  x       \mathrm{C}(f):=\{\varphi_{i}\in\mathbf{R}^{(1)}|(\forall^{\infty}x)\,\Phi_{i}(%
 x)\leq f(x)\}.     Then there exists a total computable function    f   f   f   so that for all   i   i   i          Dom   (   φ  i   )    =   Dom   (   φ   f   (  i  )     )          Dom   subscript  φ  i      Dom   subscript  φ    f  i       \mathrm{Dom}(\varphi_{i})=\mathrm{Dom}(\varphi_{f(i)})   and        C   (   φ  i   )    ⊊   C   (   φ   f   (  i  )     )     .        normal-C   subscript  φ  i      normal-C   subscript  φ    f  i       \mathrm{C}(\varphi_{i})\subsetneq\mathrm{C}(\varphi_{f(i)}).
