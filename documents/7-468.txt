   Bernstein's theorem on monotone functions      Bernstein's theorem on monotone functions   In real analysis , a branch of mathematics , Bernstein's theorem states that every real-valued function on the half-line [0, ∞) that is totally monotone is a mixture of exponential functions. In one important special case the mixture is a weighted average , or expected value .  Total monotonicity (sometimes also complete monotonicity ) of a function f means that f is continuous on [0, ∞), infinitely differentiable on (0, ∞), and satisfies         (   -  1   )   n     d  n    d   t  n     f   (  t  )    ≥  0         superscript    1   n      superscript  d  n     d   superscript  t  n     f  t   0    (-1)^{n}{d^{n}\over dt^{n}}f(t)\geq 0     for all nonnegative integers n and for all t > 0. Another convention puts the opposite inequality in the above definition.  The "weighted average" statement can be characterized thus: there is a non-negative finite Borel measure on [0, ∞), with cumulative distribution function  g , such that        f   (  t  )    =    ∫  0  ∞      e   -   t  x      d  g   (  x  )      ,        f  t     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e      t  x     d  g  x      f(t)=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-tx}\,dg(x),     the integral being a Riemann–Stieltjes integral .  Nonnegative functions whose derivative is completely monotone are called Bernstein functions . Every Bernstein function has the Lévy-Khintchine representation :       f   (  t  )    =   a  +   b  t   +    ∫  0  ∞     (   1  -   e   -   t  x      )   μ   (   d  x   )            f  t     a    b  t     superscript   subscript   0         1   superscript  e      t  x      μ    d  x        f(t)=a+bt+\int_{0}^{\infty}(1-e^{-tx})\mu(dx)     where     a  ,  b   ≥  0       a  b   0    a,b\geq 0   and   μ   μ   \mu   is a measure on the positive real half-line such that         ∫  0  ∞     (   1  ∧  x   )   μ   (   d  x   )     <  ∞   .        superscript   subscript   0         1  x   μ    d  x        \int_{0}^{\infty}(1\wedge x)\mu(dx)<\infty.     In more abstract language, the theorem characterises Laplace transforms of positive Borel measures on [0,∞). In this form it is known as the Bernstein–Widder theorem , or Hausdorff–Bernstein–Widder theorem . Felix Hausdorff had earlier characterised completely monotone sequences . These are the sequences occurring in the Hausdorff moment problem .
