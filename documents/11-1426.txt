   Adenylylsulfate—ammonia adenylyltransferase      Adenylylsulfate—ammonia adenylyltransferase   In enzymology , an adenylylsulfate-ammonia adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction adenylyl sulfate + NH 3    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate + sulfate.  Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are adenylyl sulfate and NH 3 , whereas its two products are adenosine 5'-phosphoramidate and sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is adenylyl-sulfate:ammonia adenylyltransferase . Other names in common use include APSAT , and adenylylsulfate:ammonia adenylyltransferase .
