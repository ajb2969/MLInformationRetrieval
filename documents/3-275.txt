   Dominated convergence theorem      Dominated convergence theorem   In measure theory , Lebesgue 's dominated convergence theorem provides sufficient conditions under which almost everywhere  convergence of a sequence of functions implies convergence in the L 1 norm. Its power and utility are two of the primary theoretical advantages of Lebesgue integration over Riemann integration.  It is widely used in probability theory , since it gives a sufficient condition for the convergence of expected values of random variables .  Statement of the theorem  Lebesgue's Dominated Convergence Theorem. Let { f n } be a sequence of real -valued measurable functions on a measure space . Suppose that the sequence converges pointwise to a function f and is dominated by some integrable function g in the sense that       |    f  n    (  x  )    |   ≤   g   (  x  )             subscript  f  n   x      g  x     |f_{n}(x)|\leq g(x)   for all numbers n in the index set of the sequence and all points x ∈ S . Then f is integrable and        lim   n  →  ∞      ∫  S     |    f  n   -  f   |   d  μ     =  0        subscript    normal-→  n       subscript   S          subscript  f  n   f    d  μ     0    \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{S}|f_{n}-f|\,d\mu=0   which also implies        lim   n  →  ∞      ∫  S      f  n    d  μ     =    ∫  S     f   d  μ          subscript    normal-→  n       subscript   S      subscript  f  n   d  μ       subscript   S     f  d  μ      \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{S}f_{n}\,d\mu=\int_{S}f\,d\mu     Remark 1. The statement " g is integrable" is meant in the sense of Lebesgue; that is         ∫  S     |  g  |   d  μ    <  ∞   .        subscript   S       g   d  μ       \int_{S}|g|\,d\mu<\infty.     Remark 2. The convergence of the sequence and domination by g can be relaxed to hold only almost everywhere provided the measure space  is complete or f is chosen as a measurable function which agrees  everywhere with the  everywhere existing pointwise limit. (These precautions are necessary, because otherwise there might exist a non-measurable subset of a  set , hence f might not be measurable.)  Remark 3. If μ( S ) n''}, see Vitali convergence theorem .  Proof of the theorem  Lebesgue's dominated convergence theorem is a special case of the Fatou–Lebesgue theorem . Below, however, is a direct proof that uses Fatou’s lemma as the essential tool.  Since f is the pointwise limit of the sequence (f n ) of measurable functions that are dominated by g , it is also measurable and dominated by g , hence it is integrable. Furthermore (these will be needed later),       |   f  -   f  n    |   ≤    |  f  |   +   |   f  n   |    ≤   2  g             f   subscript  f  n         f      subscript  f  n            2  g      |f-f_{n}|\leq|f|+|f_{n}|\leq 2g   for all n and        lim sup   n  →  ∞     |   f  -   f  n    |    =  0.        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n         f   subscript  f  n      0.    \limsup_{n\to\infty}|f-f_{n}|=0.   The second of these is trivially true (by the very definition of f ). Using linearity and monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral ,        |     ∫  S     f   d  μ    -    ∫  S      f  n    d  μ     |   =   |    ∫  S     (   f  -   f  n    )   d  μ    |   ≤    ∫  S     |   f  -   f  n    |   d  μ     .              subscript   S     f  d  μ      subscript   S      subscript  f  n   d  μ          subscript   S       f   subscript  f  n    d  μ            subscript   S         f   subscript  f  n     d  μ       \left|\int_{S}{f\,d\mu}-\int_{S}{f_{n}\,d\mu}\right|=\left|\int_{S}{(f-f_{n})%
 \,d\mu}\right|\leq\int_{S}{|f-f_{n}|\,d\mu}.   By the reverse Fatou lemma (it is here that we use the fact that | f − f n | is bounded above by an integrable function)         lim sup   n  →  ∞      ∫  S     |   f  -   f  n    |   d  μ     ≤    ∫  S     lim sup   n  →  ∞      |   f  -   f  n    |   d  μ     =  0   ,          subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n       subscript   S         f   subscript  f  n     d  μ       subscript   S     subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n           f   subscript  f  n     d  μ          0     \limsup_{n\to\infty}\int_{S}|f-f_{n}|\,d\mu\leq\int_{S}\limsup_{n\to\infty}|f-%
 f_{n}|\,d\mu=0,   which implies that the limit exists and vanishes i.e.        lim   n  →  ∞      ∫  S     |   f  -   f  n    |   d  μ     =  0.        subscript    normal-→  n       subscript   S         f   subscript  f  n     d  μ     0.    \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{S}|f-f_{n}|\,d\mu=0.   The theorem now follows.  If the assumptions hold only  everywhere, then there exists a  set  such that the functions f n  1 N satisfy the assumptions everywhere on S . Then f ( x ) is the pointwise limit of f n ( x ) for  and  for , hence f is measurable. The values of the integrals are not influenced by this μ-null set N .  DCT holds even if f n converges to f in measure (finite measure) and the dominating function is non-negative almost everywhere.  Discussion of the assumptions  The assumption that the sequence is dominated by some integrable g  cannot be dispensed with. This may be seen as follows: define  n }} for x in the interval and 0}} otherwise. Any g which dominates the sequence must also dominate the pointwise supremum  sup n  f n }} . Observe that         ∫  0  1    h   (  x  )   d  x    ≥    ∫   1  m   1    h   (  x  )   d  x    =    ∑   n  =  1    m  -  1      ∫   (   1   n  +  1    ,   1  n   ]     h   (  x  )   d  x     ≥    ∑   n  =  1    m  -  1      ∫   (   1   n  +  1    ,   1  n   ]      n   d  x     =    ∑   n  =  1    m  -  1     1   n  +  1     →  ∞     as  m   →  ∞      formulae-sequence        superscript   subscript   0   1     h  x  d  x      superscript   subscript     1  m    1     h  x  d  x           superscript   subscript     n  1      m  1      subscript      1    n  1      1  n       h  x  d  x            superscript   subscript     n  1      m  1      subscript      1    n  1      1  n       n  d  x            superscript   subscript     n  1      m  1      1    n  1       normal-→        normal-→    as  m       \int_{0}^{1}h(x)\,dx\geq\int_{\frac{1}{m}}^{1}{h(x)\,dx}=\sum_{n=1}^{m-1}\int_%

 \to\infty\qquad\text{as }m\to\infty   by the divergence of the harmonic series . Hence, the monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral tells us that there exists no integrable function which dominates the sequence on [0,1]. A direct calculation shows that integration and pointwise limit do not commute for this sequence:         ∫  0  1     lim   n  →  ∞      f  n    (  x  )   d  x     =  0  ≠  1  =    lim   n  →  ∞      ∫  0  1     f  n    (  x  )   d  x      ,          superscript   subscript   0   1     subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  f  n   x  d  x     0       1         subscript    normal-→  n       superscript   subscript   0   1      subscript  f  n   x  d  x        \int_{0}^{1}\lim_{n\to\infty}f_{n}(x)\,dx=0\neq 1=\lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{0}^{1%
 }f_{n}(x)\,dx,   because the pointwise limit of the sequence is the zero function . Note that the sequence { f n } is not even uniformly integrable , hence also the Vitali convergence theorem is not applicable.  Bounded convergence theorem  One corollary to the dominated convergence theorem is the bounded convergence theorem , which states that if { f n } is a sequence of uniformly bounded  real -valued measurable functions which converges pointwise on a bounded measure space (i.e. one in which μ( S ) is finite) to a function f , then the limit f is an integrable function and         lim   n  →  ∞      ∫  S      f  n    d  μ     =    ∫  S     f   d  μ     .        subscript    normal-→  n       subscript   S      subscript  f  n   d  μ       subscript   S     f  d  μ      \lim_{n\to\infty}\int_{S}{f_{n}\,d\mu}=\int_{S}{f\,d\mu}.     Remark: The pointwise convergence and uniform boundedness of the sequence can be relaxed to hold only almost everywhere , provided the measure space  is complete or f is chosen as a measurable function which agrees μ-almost everywhere with the  everywhere existing pointwise limit.  Proof  Since the sequence is uniformly bounded, there is a real number M such that f n ( x ){{!}} ≤ M }} for all  and for all n . Define  for all . Then the sequence is dominated by g . Furthermore, g is integrable since it is a constant function on a set of finite measure. Therefore the result follows from the dominated convergence theorem.  If the assumptions hold only  everywhere, then there exists a  set  such that the functions f n 1 N satisfy the assumptions everywhere on S .  Dominated convergence in L p -spaces (corollary)  Let    (  Ω  ,  𝒜  ,  μ  )     normal-Ω  𝒜  μ    (\Omega,\mathcal{A},\mu)   be a measure space ,  a real number and { f n } a sequence of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -measurable functions     f  n   :   Ω  →    \R   ∪   {  ∞  }        normal-:   subscript  f  n    normal-→  normal-Ω    \R         f_{n}:\Omega\to\R\cup\{\infty\}   .  Assume the sequence { f n } converges μ-almost everywhere to an   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -measurable function f , and is dominated by a    g  ∈   L  p       g   superscript  L  p     g\in L^{p}   , i.e., for every natural number n we have: | f n | ≤ g , μ-almost everywhere.  Then all f n as well as f are in    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}   and the sequence { f n } converges to f in the sense of    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}    , i.e.:        lim   n  →  ∞      ∥    f  n   -  f   ∥   p    =    lim   n  →  ∞      (    ∫  Ω       |    f  n   -  f   |   p    d  μ    )    1  p     =  0.          subscript    normal-→  n      subscript   norm     subscript  f  n   f    p      subscript    normal-→  n      superscript    subscript   normal-Ω      superscript       subscript  f  n   f    p   d  μ      1  p          0.     \lim_{n\to\infty}\|f_{n}-f\|_{p}=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\int_{\Omega}|f_{n}-f|%
 ^{p}\,d\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}=0.     Idea of the proof: Apply the original theorem to the function sequence     h  n   =    |    f  n   -  f   |   p        subscript  h  n    superscript       subscript  f  n   f    p     h_{n}=|f_{n}-f|^{p}   with the dominating function     (   2  g   )   p     superscript    2  g   p    (2g)^{p}   .  Extensions  The dominated convergence theorem applies also to measurable functions with values in a Banach space , with the dominating function still being non-negative and integrable as above. The assumption of convergence almost everywhere can be weakened to require only convergence in measure .
