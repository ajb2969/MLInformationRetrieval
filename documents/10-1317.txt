   Pyruvate oxidase      Pyruvate oxidase   In enzymology , a pyruvate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyruvate + phosphate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetyl phosphate + CO 2 + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are pyruvate , phosphate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are acetyl phosphate , CO 2 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyruvate:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase (phosphorylating) . Other names in common use include pyruvic oxidase , and phosphate-dependent pyruvate oxidase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Thiamin diphosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
