   Bellard's formula      Bellard's formula   Bellard's formula , as used by PiHex , the now-completed distributed computing project, is used to calculate the n th digit of π in base 2 . It is a faster version (about 43% faster 1 ) of the Bailey–Borwein–Plouffe formula .  Bellard's formula was discovered by Fabrice Bellard in 1997.  Formula      π  =    1   2  6       ∑   n  =  0   ∞         (   -  1   )   n    2   10  n        (  -     2  5     4  n   +  1         fragments  π     1   superscript  2  6     superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript    1   n    superscript  2    10  n      fragments  normal-(      superscript  2  5       4  n   1       \displaystyle\pi=\frac{1}{2^{6}}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{n}}{2^{10n}}\,%
