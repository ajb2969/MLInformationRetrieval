D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate isomerase

D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate isomerase (, sedoheptulose-7-phosphate isomerase, phosphoheptose isomerase, gmhA (gene), lpcA (gene)) is an enzyme with system name D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate aldose-ketose-isomerase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-sedoheptulose 7-phosphate 
 
 
 
  D-glycero-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate
 

In Gram-negative bacteria the enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of ADP-L-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose.
