Simple matching coefficient

The Simple Matching Coefficient (SMC) is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets.1
Given two objects, A and B, each with n binary attributes, SMC is defined as:



Where:


 
  represents the total number of attributes where A and B both have a value of 1.


 
  represents the total number of attributes where the attribute of A is 0 and the attribute of B is 1.


 
  represents the total number of attributes where the attribute of A is 1 and the attribute of B is 0.


 
  represents the total number of attributes where A and B both have a value of 0.
