   Simple matching coefficient      Simple matching coefficient   The Simple Matching Coefficient (SMC) is a statistic used for comparing the similarity and diversity of sample sets. 1  Given two objects, A and B, each with n binary attributes, SMC is defined as:       S  M  C   =   Number of Matching Attributes  Number of Attributes   =     M  00   +   M  11      M  00   +   M  01   +   M  10   +   M  11             S  M  C     Number of Matching Attributes  Number of Attributes             subscript  M  00    subscript  M  11       subscript  M  00    subscript  M  01    subscript  M  10    subscript  M  11        SMC={\text{Number of Matching Attributes}\over\text{Number of Attributes}}={{M%
 _{00}+M_{11}}\over{M_{00}+M_{01}+M_{10}+M_{11}}}     Where:      M  11     subscript  M  11    M_{11}   represents the total number of attributes where A and B both have a value of 1.      M  01     subscript  M  01    M_{01}   represents the total number of attributes where the attribute of A is 0 and the attribute of B is 1.      M  10     subscript  M  10    M_{10}   represents the total number of attributes where the attribute of A is 1 and the attribute of B is 0.      M  00     subscript  M  00    M_{00}   represents the total number of attributes where A and B both have a value of 0.
