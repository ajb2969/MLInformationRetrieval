   Chomsky–Schützenberger enumeration theorem      Chomsky–Schützenberger enumeration theorem   In formal language theory , the Chomsky–Schützenberger enumeration theorem is a theorem derived by Noam Chomsky and Marcel-Paul Schützenberger about the number of words of a given length generated by an unambiguous context-free grammar . The theorem provides an unexpected link between the theory of formal languages and abstract algebra .  Statement  In order to state the theorem, a few notions from algebra and formal language theory are needed.  A power series over   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   is an infinite series of the form      f  =   f   (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    x  k     =    a  0   +    a  1    x  1    +    a  2    x  2    +    a  3    x  3    +  ⋯         f    f  x          superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  x  k             subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1    superscript  x  1       subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2       subscript  a  3    superscript  x  3    normal-⋯      f=f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}x^{k}=a_{0}+a_{1}x^{1}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{3}x^{3}+\cdots   with coefficients    a  k     subscript  a  k    a_{k}   in   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   . The multiplication of two formal power series    f   f   f   and   g   g   g   is defined in the expected way as the convolution of the sequences    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   and    b  n     subscript  b  n    b_{n}   :          f   (  x  )    ⋅  g    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     (    ∑   i  =  0   k     a  i    b   k  -  i      )    x  k      .         normal-⋅    f  x   g   x     superscript   subscript     k  0          superscript   subscript     i  0    k      subscript  a  i    subscript  b    k  i       superscript  x  k       f(x)\cdot g(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{i=0}^{k}a_{i}b_{k-i}\right)x^{k}.     In particular, we write     f  2   =     f   (  x  )    ⋅  f    (  x  )         superscript  f  2      normal-⋅    f  x   f   x     f^{2}=f(x)\cdot f(x)   ,     f  3   =       f   (  x  )    ⋅  f    (  x  )    ⋅  f    (  x  )         superscript  f  3      normal-⋅     normal-⋅    f  x   f   x   f   x     f^{3}=f(x)\cdot f(x)\cdot f(x)   , and so on. In analogy to algebraic numbers , a power series    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is called algebraic over    ℚ   (  x  )       ℚ  x    \mathbb{Q}(x)   , if there exists a finite set of polynomials      p  0    (  x  )    ,    p  1    (  x  )    ,    p  2    (  x  )    ,  …  ,    p  n    (  x  )          subscript  p  0   x      subscript  p  1   x      subscript  p  2   x   normal-…     subscript  p  n   x     p_{0}(x),p_{1}(x),p_{2}(x),\ldots,p_{n}(x)   each with rational coefficients such that         p  0    (  x  )    +     p  1    (  x  )    ⋅  f   +     p  2    (  x  )    ⋅   f  2    +  ⋯  +     p  n    (  x  )    ⋅   f  n     =  0.           subscript  p  0   x    normal-⋅     subscript  p  1   x   f    normal-⋅     subscript  p  2   x    superscript  f  2    normal-⋯   normal-⋅     subscript  p  n   x    superscript  f  n     0.    p_{0}(x)+p_{1}(x)\cdot f+p_{2}(x)\cdot f^{2}+\cdots+p_{n}(x)\cdot f^{n}=0.     A context-free grammar is said to be unambiguous if every string generated by the grammar admits a unique parse tree or, equivalently, only one leftmost derivation . Having established the necessary notions, the theorem is stated as follows.   Chomsky–Schützenberger theorem . If   L   L   L   is a context-free language admitting an unambiguous context-free grammar, and     a  k   :=   |    L   ∩   Σ  k    |      assign   subscript  a  k       L   superscript  normal-Σ  k       a_{k}:=|L\ \cap\Sigma^{k}|   is the number of words of length   k   k   k   in   L   L   L   , then     G   (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    x  k           G  x     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  x  k       G(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}x^{k}   is a power series over   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   that is algebraic over    ℚ   (  x  )       ℚ  x    \mathbb{Q}(x)   .   Proofs of this theorem are given by , and by .  Usage  Asymptotic estimates  The theorem can be used in analytic combinatorics to estimate the number of words of length n generated by a given unambiguous context-free grammar, as n grows large. The following example is given by : The unambiguous context-free grammar G over the alphabet {0,1} has start symbol S and the following rules   S → M | U   M → 0M1M | ε   U → S | 0M1U .   To obtain an algebraic representation of the power series G(x) associated with a given context-free grammar G , one transforms the grammar into a system of equations. This is achieved by replacing each occurrence of a terminal symbol by 'x', each occurrence of 'ε' by the integer '1', each occurrence of '→' by '=', and each occurrence of '|' by '+', respectively. The operation of concatenation at the right-hand-side of each rule corresponds to the multiplication operation in the equations thus obtained. This yields the following system of equations:   S = M + U   M = M²x² + 1   U = Sx + MUx²    In this system of equations, S , M , and U are functions of x , so one could also write S(x) , M(x) , and U(x) . The equation system can be resolved after S , resulting in a single algebraic equation:   x(2x-1)S^2 + (2x-1)S +1 = 0 .   This quadratic equation has two solutions for S , one of which is the algebraic power series G(x) . By applying methods from complex analysis to this equation, the number    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   of words of length n generated by G can be estimated, as n grows large. In this case, one obtains     a  n   ∈   O    (   2  +  ϵ   )   n         subscript  a  n     O   superscript    2  ϵ   n      a_{n}\in O(2+\epsilon)^{n}   but     a  n   ∉   O    (   2  -  ϵ   )   n         subscript  a  n     O   superscript    2  ϵ   n      a_{n}\notin O(2-\epsilon)^{n}   for each    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   . See  for a detailed exposition.  Inherent ambiguity  In classical formal language theory, the theorem can be used to prove that certain context-free languages are inherently ambiguous . For example, the Goldstine language     L  G     subscript  L  G    L_{G}   over the alphabet    {  a  ,  b  }     a  b    \{a,b\}   consists of the words     a   n  1    b   a   n  2    b  ⋯   a   n  p    b       superscript  a   subscript  n  1    b   superscript  a   subscript  n  2    b  normal-⋯   superscript  a   subscript  n  p    b    a^{n_{1}}ba^{n_{2}}b\cdots a^{n_{p}}b   with    p  ≥  1      p  1    p\geq 1   ,     n  i   >  0       subscript  n  i   0    n_{i}>0   for    i  ∈   {  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  p  }       i   1  2  normal-…  p     i\in\{1,2,\ldots,p\}   , and     n  j   ≠  j       subscript  n  j   j    n_{j}\neq j   for some    j  ∈   {  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  p  }       j   1  2  normal-…  p     j\in\{1,2,\ldots,p\}   .  It is comparably easy to show that the language    L  G     subscript  L  G    L_{G}   is context-free . The harder part is to show that there does not exist an unambiguous grammar that generates    L  G     subscript  L  G    L_{G}   . This can be proved as follows: If    g  k     subscript  g  k    g_{k}   denotes the number of words of length   k   k   k   in    L  G     subscript  L  G    L_{G}   , then for the associated power series holds     G   (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     g  k    x  k     =     1  -  x    1  -   2  x     -    1  x     ∑   k  ≥  1     x     k   (   k  +  1   )    /  2   -  1               G  x     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  g  k    superscript  x  k                1  x     1    2  x         1  x     subscript     k  1     superscript  x        k    k  1    2   1          G(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}g_{k}x^{k}=\frac{1-x}{1-2x}-\frac{1}{x}\sum_{k\geq 1}x%
 ^{k(k+1)/2-1}   . Using methods from complex analysis , one can prove that this function is not algebraic over    ℚ   (  x  )       ℚ  x    \mathbb{Q}(x)   . By the Chomsky-Schützenberger theorem, one can conclude that    L  G     subscript  L  G    L_{G}   does not admit an unambiguous context-free grammar. See  for detailed account.
