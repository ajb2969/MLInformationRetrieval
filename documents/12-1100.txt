State-transition matrix

In control theory, the state-transition matrix is a matrix whose product with the state vector 
 
 
 
  at an initial time 
 
 
 
  gives 
 
 
 
  at a later time 
 
 
 
 . The state-transition matrix can be used to obtain the general solution of linear dynamical systems.
Linear systems solutions
The state-transition matrix is used to find the solution to a general state-space representation of a linear system in the following form


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  are the states of the system, 
 
 
 
  is the input signal, and 
 
 
 
  is the initial condition at 
 
 
 
 . Using the state-transition matrix 
 
 
 
 , the solution is given by:12


Peano-Baker series
The most general transition matrix is given by the Peano-Baker series


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the identity matrix. This matrix converges uniformly and absolutely to a solution that exists and is unique.3
Other properties
The state-transition matrix 
 
 
 
 , given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the fundamental solution matrix that satisfies


 
  is a 
 
 
 
  matrix that is a linear mapping onto itself, i.e., with 
 
 
 
 , given the state 
 
 
 
  at any time 
 
 
 
 , the state at any other time 
 
 
 
  is given by the mapping



The state transition matrix must always satisfy the following relationships:


 
  and


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and where 
 
 
 
  is the identity matrix.4
And 
 
 
 
 ; also must have the following properties:

If the system is time-invariant, we can define 
 
 
 
 ; as:



In the time-variant case, there are many different functions that may satisfy these requirements, and the solution is dependent on the structure of the system. The state-transition matrix must be determined before analysis on the time-varying solution can continue.
