Formimidoylaspartate deiminase

In enzymology, a formimidoylaspartate deiminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-formimidoyl-L-aspartate + H2O 
 
 
 
  N-formyl-L-aspartate + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-formimidoyl-L-aspartate and H2O, whereas its two products are N-formyl-L-aspartate and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-formimidoyl-L-aspartate iminohydrolase. This enzyme is also called formiminoaspartate deiminase. This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism.
