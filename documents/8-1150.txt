   Citrabhanu      Citrabhanu   Citrabhānu ( fl. 1530) was a mathematician from the Kerala school in the 16th century. He gave integer solutions to 21 types of systems of two simultaneous  Diophantine equations in two unknowns. 1 These types are all the possible pairs of equations of the following seven forms: 2        x   +  y   =  a   ,     x  -  y   =  b   ,     x  y   =  c   ,      x  2   +   y  2    =  d   ,      x  2   -   y  2    =  e   ,      x  3   +   y  3    =  f   ,     x  3   -   y  3    =  g           formulae-sequence      x  y   a    formulae-sequence      x  y   b    formulae-sequence      x  y   c    formulae-sequence       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    d    formulae-sequence       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    e    formulae-sequence       superscript  x  3    superscript  y  3    f        superscript  x  3    superscript  y  3    g          \ x+y=a,x-y=b,xy=c,x^{2}+y^{2}=d,x^{2}-y^{2}=e,x^{3}+y^{3}=f,x^{3}-y^{3}=g     For each case, Citrabhanu gave an explanation and justification of his rule as well as an example. Some of his explanations are algebraic, while others are geometric.  References  "  Category:Kerala school  Category:15th-century births  Category:16th-century deaths     . ↩  . ↩
