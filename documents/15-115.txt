Snell envelope

The Snell envelope, used in stochastics and mathematical finance, is the smallest supermartingale dominating a stochastic process. The Snell envelope is named after James Laurie Snell.
Definition
Given a filtered probability space

 
  and an absolutely continuous probability measure

 
  then an adapted process

 
  is the Snell envelope with respect to 
 
 
 
  of the process 
 
 
 
  if



 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -supermartingale


 
  dominates 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 

 
 -almost surely for all times 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -supermartingale which dominates 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  dominates

Construction
Given a (discrete) filtered probability space

 
  and an absolutely continuous probability measure

 
  then the Snell envelope 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  of the process 
 
 
 
  is given by the recursive scheme





 
  for 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the join.2
Application

If 
 
 
 
  is a discounted American option payoff with Snell envelope 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is the minimal capital requirement to hedge 
 
 
 
  from time 
 
 
 
  to the expiration date.3
