Let the two smaller circles have radii  r 1 and r 2 , from which it follows that the larger semicircle has radius r = r 1 + r 2 . Let the points D and E be the center and midpoint , respectively, of the semicircle with the radius r 1 . Let H be the midpoint of line AC . Then two of the four quadruplet circles are tangent to line HE at the point E , and are also tangent to the outer semicircle. The other two quadruplet circles are formed in a symmetric way from the semicircle with radius r 2 .  Proof of congruency  According to Proposition 5 of Archimedes ' Book of Lemmas , the common radius of Archimedes' twin circles is:         r  1   ⋅   r  2    r   .       normal-⋅   subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    r    \frac{r_{1}\cdot r_{2}}{r}.     By the Pythagorean theorem :         (   H  E   )   2   =     (   r  1   )   2   +    (   r  2   )   2     .       superscript    H  E   2      superscript   subscript  r  1   2    superscript   subscript  r  2   2      \left(HE\right)^{2}=\left(r_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(r_{2}\right)^{2}.     Then, create two circles with centers J i  perpendicular to HE , tangent to the large semicircle at point L i , tangent to point E , and with equal radii x . Using the Pythagorean theorem :        (   H   J  i    )   2   =     (   H  E   )   2   +   x  2    =     (   r  1   )   2   +    (   r  2   )   2   +   x  2           superscript    H   subscript  J  i    2      superscript    H  E   2    superscript  x  2            superscript   subscript  r  1   2    superscript   subscript  r  2   2    superscript  x  2       \left(HJ_{i}\right)^{2}=\left(HE\right)^{2}+x^{2}=\left(r_{1}\right)^{2}+\left%
 (r_{2}\right)^{2}+x^{2}     Also:       H   J  i    =    H   L  i    -  x   =   r  -  x   =     r  1   +   r  2    -   x            H   subscript  J  i        H   subscript  L  i    x          r  x             subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    x      HJ_{i}=HL_{i}-x=r-x=r_{1}+r_{2}-x~{}     Combining these gives:         (   r  1   )   2   +    (   r  2   )   2   +   x  2    =    (     r  1   +   r  2    -  x   )   2          superscript   subscript  r  1   2    superscript   subscript  r  2   2    superscript  x  2     superscript       subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    x   2     \left(r_{1}\right)^{2}+\left(r_{2}\right)^{2}+x^{2}=\left(r_{1}+r_{2}-x\right)%
