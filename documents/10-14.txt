It is analogous to the square tiling of the plane and to the cubic honeycomb of 3-space, and the tesseractic honeycomb of 4-space.  There are many different Wythoff constructions of this honeycomb. The most symmetric form is regular , with Schläfli symbol {4,3 6 ,4}. Another form has two alternating hypercube facets (like a checkerboard ) with Schläfli symbol {4,3 5 ,3 1,1 }. The lowest symmetry Wythoff construction has 256 types of facets around each vertex and a prismatic product Schläfli symbol {∞} 8 .  Related honeycombs  The [4,3 6 ,4], , Coxeter group generates 511 permutations of uniform tessellations , 271 with unique symmetry and 270 with unique geometry. The expanded 8-cubic honeycomb is geometrically identical to the 8-cubic honeycomb.  The 8-cubic honeycomb can be alternated into the 8-demicubic honeycomb , replacing the 8-cubes with 8-demicubes , and the alternated gaps are filled by 8-orthoplex facets.  Quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb  A quadrirectified 8-cubic honeycomb , , containins all trirectified 8-orthoplex facets and is the Voronoi tessellation of the D 8 * lattice . Facets can be identically colored from a doubled     C  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  C   8    {\tilde{C}}_{8}   ×2, [[4,3 6 ,4]] symmetry, alternately colored from     C  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  C   8    {\tilde{C}}_{8}   , [4,3 6 ,4] symmetry, three colors from     B  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  B   8    {\tilde{B}}_{8}   , [4,3 5 ,3 1,1 ] symmetry, and 4 colors from     D  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  D   8    {\tilde{D}}_{8}   , [3 1,1 ,3 4 ,3 1,1 ] symmetry.
