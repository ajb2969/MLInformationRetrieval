It is analogous to the square tiling of the plane and to the cubic honeycomb of 3-space, and the tesseractic honeycomb of 4-space.
There are many different Wythoff constructions of this honeycomb. The most symmetric form is regular, with Schläfli symbol {4,36,4}. Another form has two alternating hypercube facets (like a checkerboard) with Schläfli symbol {4,35,31,1}. The lowest symmetry Wythoff construction has 256 types of facets around each vertex and a prismatic product Schläfli symbol {∞}8.

The [4,36,4], , Coxeter group generates 511 permutations of uniform tessellations, 271 with unique symmetry and 270 with unique geometry. The expanded 8-cubic honeycomb is geometrically identical to the 8-cubic honeycomb.
The 8-cubic honeycomb can be alternated into the 8-demicubic honeycomb, replacing the 8-cubes with 8-demicubes, and the alternated gaps are filled by 8-orthoplex facets.
