RRNA small subunit pseudouridine methyltransferase Nep1

RRNA small subunit pseudouridine methyltransferase Nep1 (, Nep1, nucleolar essential protein 1) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:18S rRNA (pseudouridine1191-N1)-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + pseudouridine1191 in yeast 18S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methylpseudouridine1191 in yeast 18S rRNA
 

This enzyme recognizes specific pseudouridine residues (Psi) in small subunits of ribosomal RNA based on the local RNA structure.
