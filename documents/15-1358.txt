   RRNA small subunit pseudouridine methyltransferase Nep1      RRNA small subunit pseudouridine methyltransferase Nep1   RRNA small subunit pseudouridine methyltransferase Nep1 (, Nep1 , nucleolar essential protein 1 ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:18S rRNA (pseudouridine 1191 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + pseudouridine 1191 in yeast  18S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 -methylpseudouridine 1191 in yeast 18S rRNA   This enzyme recognizes specific pseudouridine residues (Psi) in small subunits of ribosomal RNA based on the local RNA structure.
