   Pteridine oxidase      Pteridine oxidase   In enzymology , a pteridine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-amino-4,7-dihydroxypteridine + (?)   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine and O 2 , whereas its product is 2-amino-4,7-dihydroxypteridine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on CH or CH 2 groups with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine:oxygen oxidoreductase (7-hydroxylating) .  References     "  Category:EC 1.17.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
