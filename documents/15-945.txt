Laguerre plane

In mathematics, a Laguerre plane is one of the Benz planes: Möbius plane, Laguerre plane and Minkowski plane, named after the French mathematician Edmond Nicolas Laguerre.  Essentially the classical Laguerre plane is an incidence structure which describes the incidence behaviour of the curves 
 
 
 
  , i.e. parabolas and lines, in the real affine plane. In order to simplify the structure, to any curve 
 
 
 
  the point 
 
 
 
  is added. A further advantage of these completion is: The plane geometry of the completed parabolas/lines is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections of a cylinder (s. below).
The classical real Laguerre plane
Originally the classical Laguerre plane was defined as the geometry of the oriented lines and circles in the real euclidean plane (see 1). Here we prefer the parabola model of the classical Laguerre plane.
We define:


 
  the set of points, 
 
 
 
  the set of cycles.
The incidence structure 
 
 
 
  is called classical Laguerre plane.
The point set is 
 
 
 
  plus a copy of 
 
 
 
  (see figure). Any parabola/line 
 
 
 
  gets the additional point 
 
 
 
 .
Points with the same x-coordinate cannot be connected by curves 
 
 
 
 . Hence we define:
Two points 
 
 
 
  are parallel (
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
  or there is no cycle containing 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
For the description of the classical real Laguerre plane above two points 
 
 
 
  are parallel if and only if 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is an equivalence relation, similar to the parallelity of lines.
The incidence structure 
 
 
 
  has the following properties:
Lemma:
:* For any three points 
 
 
 
 , pairwise not parallel, there is exactly one cycle 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
 .
:* For any point 
 
 
 
  and any cycle 
 
 
 
  there is exactly one point 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
:* For any cycle 
 
 
 
 , any point 
 
 
 
  and any point 
 
 
 
  which is not parallel to 
 
 
 
  there is exactly one cycle 
 
 
 
  through 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
touch each other at 
 
 
 
 ''.  Similar to the sphere model of the classical Moebius plane there is a cylinder model for the classical Laguerre plane:


 
  is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a circular cylinder in 
 
 
 
  .
The following mapping 
 
 
 
  is a projection with center 
 
 
 
  that maps the x-z-plane onto the cylinder with the equation 
 
 
 
 , axis 
 
 
 
  and radius 
 
 





The points 
 
 
 
  (line on the cylinder through the center) apper not as images.


 
  projects the parabola/line with equation 
 
 
 
  into the plane 
 
 
 
 . So, the image of the parabola/line is the plane section of the cylinder with a non perpendicular plane and hence a circle/ellipse without point 
 
 
 
 . The parabolas/line 
 
 
 
  are mapped onto (horizontal) circles.
A line(a=0) is mapped onto a circle/Ellipse through center 
 
 
 
  and a parabola ( 
 
 
 
 ) onto a circle/ellipse that do not contain 
 
 
 
 .

The axioms of a Laguerre plane
The Lemma above gives rise to the following definition:
Let 
 
 
 
  be an incidence structure with point set 
 
 
 
  and set of cycles

 
 .
 Two points 
 
 
 
  are parallel (
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
  or there is no cycle containing 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

 
  is called Laguerre plane if the following axioms hold: 

B1: For any three points 
 
 
 
 , pairwise not parallel, there is exactly one cycle 
 
 
 
  which contains 
 
 
 
 .
 


B2: For any point 
 
 
 
  and any cycle 
 
 
 
  there is exactly one point 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
 


B3: For any cycle 
 
 
 
 , any point 
 
 
 
  and any point 
 
 
 
  which is not parallel to 
 
 
 
  there is exactly one cycle 
 
 
 
  through 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 ,
 
i.e. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
touch each other at 
 
 
 
 .
 


B4: Any cycle contains at least three points, there is at least one cycle. There are at least four points not on a cycle.
 

Four points 
 
 
 
  are concyclic if there is a cycle 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
From the definition of relation 
 
 
 
  and axiom B2 we get
Lemma: Relation 
 
 
 
  is an equivalence relation.
Following the cylinder model of the classical Laguerre-plane we introduce the denotation:
a) For 
 
 
 
  we set 
 
 
 
 . b) An equivalence class 
 
 
 
  is called generator.
For the classical Laguerre plane a generator is a line parallel to the y-axis (plane model) or a line on the cylinder (space model).
The connection to linear geometry is given by the following definition:
For a Laguerre plane 
 
 
 
  we define the local structure



and call it the residue at point P.
In the plane model of the classical Laguerre plane 
 
 
 
 
  is the real affine plane 
 
 
 
 . In general we get
Theorem: Any residue of a Laguerre plane is an affine plane.
And the equivalent definition of a Laguerre plane:
Theorem: An incidence structure together with an equivalence relation 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  is a Laguerre plane if and only if for any point 
 
 
 
  the residue 
 
 
 
 
  is an affine plane.
Finite Laguerre planes
 The following incidence structure is a minimal model of a Laguerre plane:








 
  Hence 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

For finite Laguerre planes, i.e. 
 
 
 
 , we get:
Lemma: For any cycles 
 
 
 
  and any generator 
 
 
 
  of a finite Laguerre plane 
 
 
 
  we have:


 
 .
For a finite Laguerre plane 
 
 
 
  and a cycle 
 
 
 
  the integer 
 
 
 
  is called order of 
 
 
 
 .
From combinatorics we get
Lemma: Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a Laguerre—plane of order

 
 . Then

a) any residue 
 
 
 
  is an affine plane of order 
 
 
 
  b) 
 
 
 
  c) 
 
 


Miquelian Laguerre planes
Unlike Moebius planes the formal generalization of the classical model of a Laguerre plane, i.e. replacing 
 
 
 
  by an arbitrary field 
 
 
 
 , leads in any case to an example of a Laguerre plane.
Theorem: For a field

 
  and



 
 
 ,


 
  the incidence structure


 
  is a Laguerre plane with the following parallel relation
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
Similar to a Möbius plane the Laguerre version of the Theorem of Miquel holds: 
Theorem of MIQUEL: For the Laguerre plane 
 
 
 
 
  the following is true:

If for any 8 pairwise not parallel points 
 
 
 
  which can be assigned to the vertices of a cube such that the points in 5 faces correspond to concyclical quadruples than the sixth quadruple of points is concyclical, too.
 

(For a better overview in the figure there are circles drawn instead of parabolas)
The importance of the Theorem of Miquel shows the following theorem which is due to v. d. Waerden, Smid and Chen:
Theorem: Only a Laguerre plane 
 
 
 
  satisfies the theorem of Miquel.
Because of the last Theorem 
 
 
 
  is called a miquelian Laguerre plane.
Remark: The minimal model of a Laguerre plane is miquelian.
 : It is isomorphic to the Laguerre plane 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  (field 
 
 
 
 ).
Remark: A suitable stereographic projection shows
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections on a quadric cylinder over field 
 
 
 
 .
Ovoidal Laguerre planes
There are a lot of Laguerre planes which are not miquelian (s. weblink below). The class which is most similar to miquelian Laguerre planes are the ovoidal Laguerre planes. An ovoidal Laguerre plane is the geometrty of the plane sections of a cylinder which is constructed by using an oval instead of a non degenerate conic. An oval is a quadratic set and bears the same geometric properties as a non degenerate conic in a projective plane: 1) a line intersects an oval in no or 1 or two pints and 2) at any point there is a unique tangent. A simple oval in the real plane can be constructed by clueing together two suitable halves of different ellipses, such that the result is no conic. Even in the finite case there exist ovals (see quadratic set).
