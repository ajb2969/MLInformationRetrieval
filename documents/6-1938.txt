   Gamma Herculis      Gamma Herculis   Gamma Herculis (γ Herculis, γ Her) is a magnitude 3.74 binary star system in the northern constellation of Hercules . 1  Properties  This is known to be a spectroscopic binary system, 2 although there is no information about the secondary component. 3 Based upon parallax measurements, this system is located at a distance of about  from the Earth . 4 The spectrum of the primary star matches a stellar classification of A9III, which indicates this is a giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence . The effective temperature is about 7,031 K, 5 giving the star a white hue characteristic of A-type stars . 6 It is rotating rapidly with a projected rotational velocity of . 7 The interferometry -measured angular diameter of this star is , 8 which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about six times the radius of the Sun . 9  Observations by German astronomer Ernst Zinner in 1929 gave indications that this may be a variable star . It was listed in the New Catalogue of Suspected Variable Stars (1981) with a magnitude range of 3.74 to 3.81. Further observations up to 1991 showed a pattern of small, slow variations with a magnitude variation of 0.05. These appeared to repeat semi-regularly with a period of 183.6 days, although the spectroscopic data presented a longer period of 165.9 days. 10  Name  It was a member of indigenous Arabic asterism  al-Nasaq al-Sha'āmī , "the Northern Line" of al-Nasaqān "the Two Lines", 11 along with β Her (Kornephoros), γ Ser (Zheng, Ching) and β Ser (Chow). 12  According to the catalogue of stars in the Technical Memorandum 33-507 - A Reduced Star Catalog Containing 537 Named Stars , al-Nasaq al-Sha'āmī or Nasak Shamiya were the title for three stars : β Ser as Nasak Shamiya I , γ Ser as Nasak Shamiya II , γ Her as Nasak Shamiya III (exclude β Her ) 13  In Chinese ,  (), meaning Right Wall of Heavenly Market Enclosure , refers to an asterism which is represent eleven old states in China which is marking the right borderline of the enclosure, consisting of γ Herculis, β Herculis , κ Herculis , γ Serpentis , β Serpentis , δ Serpentis , α Serpentis , ε Serpentis , δ Ophiuchi , ε Ophiuchi and ζ Ophiuchi . 14 Consequently, γ Herculis itself is known as  (, ), represent Héjiān (河間), possibly Hejian states (located in roughly modern Cangzhou , Hebei ) or Hejian Commandery (located in roughly modern Baoding , Hebei ), (see : Sima Yong , the Prince of Hejian 河間王 and Liu Wuzhou ). 15 16  Héjiān (河間) was westernized into Ho Keen by R.H. Allen, which was the meaning "between the river". 17  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 12.0\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 18  19  20  }}  "  Category:Hercules (constellation)  Category:Binary stars                 Jack W.
