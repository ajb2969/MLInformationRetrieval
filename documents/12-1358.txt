   Semidiameter      Semidiameter   In geometry , the semidiameter or semi-diameter of a set of points may be one half of its diameter ; or, sometimes, one half of its extent along a particular direction.  Special cases  The semi-diameter of a sphere , circle , or interval is the same thing as its radius â€” namely, any line segment from the center to its boundary .  The semi-diameters of a non-circular ellipse are the halves of its extents along the two axes of symmetry . They are the parameters a , b of the implicit equation          (   x  a   )   2   +    (   y  b   )   2    =  1   ;         superscript    x  a   2    superscript    y  b   2    1    \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^{2}=1;\,\!   Likewise, the semi-diameters of an ellipsoid are the parameters a , b , and c of its implicit equation          (   x  a   )   2   +    (   y  b   )   2   +    (   z  c   )   2    =  1   ;         superscript    x  a   2    superscript    y  b   2    superscript    z  c   2    1    \left(\frac{x}{a}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{y}{b}\right)^{2}+\left(\frac{z}{c}%
 \right)^{2}=1;\,\!   The semi-diameters of a superellipse , superellipsoid , or superquadric can be identified in the same way.  "  Category:Geometric measurement
