   Radical of an ideal      Radical of an ideal   In commutative ring theory, a branch of mathematics , the radical of an ideal  I is an ideal such that an element x is in the radical if some power of x is in I . A radical ideal (or semiprime ideal ) is an ideal that is its own radical (this can be phrased as being a fixed point of an operation on ideals called 'radicalization'). The radical of a primary ideal is prime.  Radical ideals defined here are generalized to noncommutative rings in the Semiprime ring article.  Definition  The radical of an ideal I in a commutative ring  R , denoted by Rad( I ) or    I      I    \sqrt{I}   , is defined as        I   =   {   r  ‚àà  R   ‚à£    r  n   ‚àà    I    for some positive integer   n    }    .        I    conditional-set    r  R      superscript  r  n     I  for some positive integer  n       \sqrt{I}=\{r\in R\mid r^{n}\in I\ \hbox{for some positive integer}\ n\}.     Intuitively, one can think of the radical of I as obtained by taking all the possible roots of elements of I . Equivalently, the radical of I is the pre-image of the ideal of nilpotent elements (called nilradical ) in    R  /  I      R  I    R/I   . A direct proof can be give as follows:  Let a and b be in the radical of an ideal I . Then, for some positive integers m and n , a n and b m are in I . We will show that a + b is in the radical of I . Use the binomial theorem to expand ( a + b ) n + m ‚àí1 (with commutativity assumed):         (   a  +  b   )     n  +  m   -  1    =    ‚àë   i  =  0     n  +  m   -  1      (       n  +  m   -  1       i     )    a  i    b    n  +  m   -  1  -  i       .       superscript    a  b       n  m   1      superscript   subscript     i  0        n  m   1       binomial      n  m   1   i    superscript  a  i    superscript  b      n  m   1  i        (a+b)^{n+m-1}=\sum_{i=0}^{n+m-1}{n+m-1\choose i}a^{i}b^{n+m-1-i}.     For each i , exactly one of the following conditions will hold:   i ‚â• n  n + m ‚àí 1 ‚àí i ‚â• m .   This says that in each expression a i b n + m ‚àí 1 ‚àí i , either the exponent of a will be large enough to make this power of a be in I , or the exponent of b will be large enough to make this power of b be in I . Since the product of an element in I with an element in R is in I (as I is an ideal), this product expression will be in I , and then ( a + b ) n + m ‚àí1 is in I , therefore a + b is in the radical of I .  To finish checking that the radical is an ideal, we take an element a in the radical, with a n in I and an arbitrary element r ‚àà R . Then, ( ra ) n = r n a n is in I , so ra is in the radical. Thus the radical is an ideal. The latter shows    I      I    \sqrt{I}   is an ideal itself, containing I .  If the radical of I is finitely generated, then some power of    I      I    \sqrt{I}   is contained in I . 1 In particular, If I and J are ideals of a noetherian ring, then I and J have the same radical if and only if I contains some power of J and J contains some power of I .  If an ideal I coincides with its own radical, then I is called a radical ideal or semiprime ideal .  Examples  Consider the ring Z of integers .   The radical of the ideal 4 Z of integer multiples of 4 is 2 Z .  The radical of 5 Z is 5 Z .  The radical of 12 Z is 6 Z .  In general, the radical of m Z ' is ''r Z''', where r is the product of all distinct prime factors of m (each prime factor of m occurs exactly once as a factor of the product r ) (see radical of an integer ). In fact, this generalizes to an arbitrary ideal; see the properties section.   The radical of a primary ideal is prime. If the radical of an ideal I is maximal, then I is primary. 2  If I is an ideal,      I  n    =   I          superscript  I  n      I     \sqrt{I^{n}}=\sqrt{I}   . A prime ideal is a radical ideal. So     P   =  P        P   P    \sqrt{P}=P   for any prime ideal P .  Let I , J be ideals of a ring R . If     I   ,   J        I     J     \sqrt{I},\sqrt{J}   are comaximal , then    I  ,  J     I  J    I,J   are comaximal. 3  Let M be a finitely generated module over a noetherian ring R . Then         ann  R    (  M  )     =    ‚ãÇ   ùî≠  ‚àà   supp  M     ùî≠   =    ‚ãÇ   ùî≠  ‚àà   ass  M     ùî≠             subscript  ann  R   M      subscript     ùî≠   supp  M     ùî≠          subscript     ùî≠   ass  M     ùî≠      \sqrt{\operatorname{ann}_{R}(M)}=\bigcap_{\mathfrak{p}\in\operatorname{supp}M}%
 \mathfrak{p}=\bigcap_{\mathfrak{p}\in\operatorname{ass}M}\mathfrak{p}    4 where    supp  M     supp  M    \operatorname{supp}M   is the support of M and    ass  M     ass  M    \operatorname{ass}M   is the set of associated primes of M .  Properties  This section will continue the convention that I is an ideal of a commutative ring R :   It is always true that Rad(Rad( I ))=Rad( I ). Moreover, Rad( I ) is the smallest radical ideal containing I .    Rad( I ) is the intersection of all the prime ideals of R that contain I . Proof: On one hand, every prime ideal is radical, and so this intersection contains Rad( I ). Suppose r is an element of R which is not in Rad( I ), and let S be the set { r n | n is a nonnegative integer}. By the definition of Rad( I ), S must be disjoint from I . S is also multiplicatively closed . Thus, by a variant of Krull's theorem , there exists a prime ideal P that contains I and is still disjoint from S . (see prime ideal .) Since P contains I , but not r , this shows that r is not in the intersection of prime ideals containing I . This finishes the proof. The statement may be strengthened a bit: the radical of I is the intersection of all prime ideals of R that are minimal among those containing I .    Specializing the last point, the nilradical (the set of all nilpotent elements) is equal to the intersection of all prime ideals of R .    An ideal I in a ring R is radical if and only if the quotient ring  R/I is reduced .    The radical of a homogeneous ideal is homogeneous.   Applications  The primary motivation in studying radicals is the celebrated Hilbert's Nullstellensatz in commutative algebra . An easily understood version of this theorem states that for an algebraically closed field  k , and for any finitely generated polynomial ideal J in the n indeterminates     x  1   ,   x  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n     x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}   over the field k , one has       I   (   V   (  J  )    )    =   Rad   (  J  )         normal-I   normal-V  J     Rad  J     \operatorname{I}(\operatorname{V}(J))=\operatorname{Rad}(J)\,   where       V   (  J  )    =   {   x  ‚àà    k  n     |    f   (  x  )    =   0  for all  f   ‚àà  J   }        normal-V  J    conditional-set    x   superscript  k  n          f  x     0  for all  f        J       \operatorname{V}(J)=\{x\in k^{n}\ |\ f(x)=0\mbox{ for all }f\in J\}   and        I   (  S  )    =   {   f  ‚àà   k   [   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   ‚Ä¶   x  n    ]     |    f   (  x  )    =   0  for all  x   ‚àà  S   }    .       normal-I  S    conditional-set    f    k    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n             f  x     0  for all  x        S       \operatorname{I}(S)=\{f\in k[x_{1},x_{2},\ldots x_{n}]\ |\ f(x)=0\mbox{ for %
 all }x\in S\}.     Another way of putting it: The composition     I   (   V   (  -  )    )    =   Rad   (  -  )         normal-I   normal-V      Rad      \operatorname{I}(\operatorname{V}(-))=\operatorname{Rad}(-)\,   on the set of ideals of a ring is in fact a closure operator . From the definition of the radical, it is clear that taking the radical is an idempotent operation.  See also   Jacobson radical  Nilradical of a ring   Notes  References   M. Atiyah , I.G.
