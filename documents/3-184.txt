   Damköhler numbers      Damköhler numbers   The Damköhler numbers ( Da ) are dimensionless numbers used in chemical engineering to relate the chemical reaction timescale ( reaction rate ) to the transport phenomena rate occurring in a system. It is named after German chemist Gerhard Damköhler .  In its most commonly used form, the Damköhler number relates the reaction timescale to the convection times scale, flow rate , through the reactor for continuous or semibatch chemical processes:      Da  =   reaction rate  convective mass transport rate       Da    reaction rate  convective mass transport rate     \mathrm{Da}=\frac{\text{reaction rate}}{\text{convective mass transport rate}}     In reacting systems that include interphase mass transport, the second Damköhler number ( Da II ) is defined as the ratio of the chemical reaction rate to the mass transfer rate       Da  II   =   reaction rate  diffusive mass transfer rate        subscript  Da  II     reaction rate  diffusive mass transfer rate     \mathrm{Da}_{\mathrm{II}}=\frac{\text{reaction rate}}{\text{diffusive mass %
 transfer rate}}     It is also defined as the ratio of the characteristic fluidic and chemical time scales:      Da  =   flow time scale  chemical time scale       Da    flow time scale  chemical time scale     \mathrm{Da}=\frac{\text{flow time scale}}{\text{chemical time scale}}     Since the reaction timescale is determined by the reaction rate, the exact formula for the Damköhler number varies according to the raw law equation. For a general chemical reaction A → B of nth order , the Damköhler number for a convective flow system is defined as:      Da  =   k   C  0    n   -  1    τ       Da    k   superscript   subscript  C  0     n  1    τ     \mathrm{Da}=kC_{0}^{\ n-1}\tau   where:   k = kinetics  reaction rate constant  C 0 = initial concentration  n = reaction order     τ   τ   \tau   = mean residence time or space time   On the other hand, the second Damköhler number is defined as:       Da  II   =    k   C  0   n  -  1       k  g   a         subscript  Da  II       k   superscript   subscript  C  0     n  1        subscript  k  g   a      \mathrm{Da}_{\mathrm{II}}=\frac{kC_{0}^{n-1}}{k_{g}a}   where   k g is the global mass transport coefficient  a is the interfacial area   The value of Da provides a quick estimate of the degree of conversion that can be achieved. As a rule of thumb , when Da is less than 0.1 a conversion of less than 10% is achieved,and when Da is greater than 10 a conversion of more than 90% is expected. 1  The Karlovitz number is related to the Damköhler number by Da=1/Ka.
