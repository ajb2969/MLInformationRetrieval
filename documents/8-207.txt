Random compact set

In mathematics, a random compact set is essentially a compact set-valued random variable. Random compact sets are useful in the study of attractors for random dynamical systems.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a complete separable metric space. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the set of all compact subsets of 
 
 
 
 . The Hausdorff metric 
 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  is defined by



 
  is also а complete separable metric space. The corresponding open subsets generate a σ-algebra on 
 
 
 
 , the Borel sigma algebra

 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .
A random compact set is а measurable function

 
  from а probability space

 
  into 
 
 
 
 .
Put another way, a random compact set is a measurable function 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is almost surely compact and



is a measurable function for every 
 
 
 
 .
Discussion
Random compact sets in this sense are also random closed sets as in Matheron (1975). Consequently their distribution is given by the probabilities


 
  for 
 
 

(The distribution of а random compact convex set is also given by the system of all inclusion probabilities 
 
 
 
 )
For 
 
 
 
 , the probability 
 
 
 
  is obtained, which satisfies



Thus the covering function

 
 
  is given by


 
  for 
 
 

Of course, 
 
 
 
  can also be interpreted as the mean of the indicator function 
 
 
 
 :



The covering function takes values between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The set 
 
 
 
  of all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  is called the support of 
 
 
 
 . The set 
 
 
 
 , of all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  is called the kernel, the set of fixed points, or essential minimum

 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , is а sequence of i.i.d. random compact sets, then almost surely



and 
 
 
 
  converges almost surely to
