   Factorial moment      Factorial moment   In probability theory , the factorial moment is a mathematical quantity defined as the expectation or average of the falling factorial of a random variable . Factorial moments are useful for studying non-negative  integer -valued random variables. 1 and arise in the use of probability-generating functions to derive the moments of discrete random variables.  Factorial moments serve as analytic tools in the mathematical field of combinatorics, which is the study of discrete mathematical structures. 2  Definition  For a natural number   r   r   r   , the   r   r   r   -th factorial moment of a probability distribution on the real or complex numbers, or, in other words, a random variable    X   X   X   with that probability distribution, is 3        E   [    (  X  )   r   ]    =   E   [   X   (   X  -  1   )    (   X  -  2   )   ⋯   (    X  -  r   +  1   )    ]     ,       normal-E   subscript  X  r     normal-E    X    X  1     X  2   normal-⋯      X  r   1       \operatorname{E}\bigl[(X)_{r}\bigr]=\operatorname{E}\bigl[X(X-1)(X-2)\cdots(X-%
 r+1)\bigr],     where the   E   E   E   is the expectation ( operator ) and        (  x  )   r   =   x   (   x  -  1   )    (   x  -  2   )   ⋯   (    x  -  r   +  1   )         subscript  x  r     x    x  1     x  2   normal-⋯      x  r   1      (x)_{r}=x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-r+1)     is the falling factorial , which gives rise to the name, although the notation varies depending on the mathematical field. Of course, the definition requires that the expectation is meaningful, which is the case if or .  Examples  Poisson distribution  If a random variable   X   X   X   has a Poisson distribution with parameter or expected value     λ  ≥  0      λ  normal-≥  0    λ≥0   , then the factorial moments of   X   X   X   are         E   [    (  X  )   r   ]    =   λ  r    ,   r  ∈   ℕ  0     .     formulae-sequence     normal-E   subscript  X  r     superscript  λ  r      r   subscript  ℕ  0      \operatorname{E}\bigl[(X)_{r}\bigr]=\lambda^{r},\qquad r\in\mathbb{N}_{0}.     The Poisson distribution has a factorial moments with straightforward form compared to its moments , which involve Stirling numbers of the second kind .

 \ldots,n\},     where   !     !   denotes the factorial of a non-negative integer. For all    r  >  n      r  n    r>n   , the factorial moments are zero.  Hypergeometric distribution  If a random variable   X   X   X   has a hypergeometric distribution with population size   N   N   N   , number of success states } in the population, and draws }, then the factorial moments of   X   X   X   are 5         E   [    (  X  )   r   ]    =     K  !     (   K  -  r   )   !      n  !     (   n  -  r   )   !       (   N  -  r   )   !    N  !      ,   r  ∈   {  0  ,  1  ,  …  ,   min   {  n  ,  K  }    }     .     formulae-sequence     normal-E   subscript  X  r          K       K  r         n       n  r           N  r      N        r   0  1  normal-…    n  K       \operatorname{E}\bigl[(X)_{r}\bigr]=\frac{K!}{(K-r)!}\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\frac{(N%
 -r)!}{N!},\qquad r\in\{0,1,\ldots,\min\{n,K\}\}.     For all larger   r   r   r   , the factorial moments are zero.  Beta-binomial distribution  If a random variable   X   X   X   has a beta-binomial distribution with parameters    α  >  0      α  0    α>0   ,    β  >  0      β  0    β>0   , and number of trails   n   n   n   , then the factorial moments of   X   X   X   are         E   [    (  X  )   r   ]    =     n  !     (   n  -  r   )   !      B   (   α  +  r   ,  β  )     B   (  α  ,  β  )       ,   r  ∈   {  0  ,  1  ,  …  ,  n  }     ,     formulae-sequence     normal-E   subscript  X  r          n       n  r         B     α  r   β      B   α  β         r   0  1  normal-…  n      \operatorname{E}\bigl[(X)_{r}\bigr]=\frac{n!}{(n-r)!}\frac{B(\alpha+r,\beta)}{%
 B(\alpha,\beta)},\qquad r\in\{0,1,\ldots,n\},     where   B   B   B   denotes the beta function . For all    r  >  n      r  n    r>n   , the factorial moments are zero.  Calculation of moments  In the examples above, the   n   n   n   -th moment of the random variable   X   X   X   can be calculated by the formula         E   [   X  n   ]    =    ∑   r  =  0   n     {     n      r     }    E   [    (  X  )   r   ]       ,   n  ∈   ℕ  0     ,     formulae-sequence     normal-E   superscript  X  n      superscript   subscript     r  0    n       STACKED  n  r     normal-E   subscript  X  r         n   subscript  ℕ  0      \operatorname{E}\bigl[X^{n}\bigr]=\sum_{r=0}^{n}\biggl\{{n\atop r}\biggr\}%
