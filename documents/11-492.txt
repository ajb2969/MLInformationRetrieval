Glycerophosphocholine cholinephosphodiesterase

In enzymology, a glycerophosphocholine cholinephosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + H2O 
 
 
 
  glycerol + choline phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and H2O, whereas its two products are glycerol and choline phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine cholinephosphohydrolase. This enzyme is also called L-3-glycerylphosphinicocholine cholinephosphohydrolase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
