Diphosphate—serine phosphotransferase




Diphosphate—serine phosphotransferase

In enzymology, a diphosphate-serine phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

diphosphate + L-serine 
 
 
 
  phosphate + O-phospho-L-serine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are diphosphate and L-serine, whereas its two products are phosphate and O-phospho-L-serine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is diphosphate:L-serine O-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include pyrophosphate-serine phosphotransferase, and pyrophosphate-L-serine phosphotransferase.
