Rheonomous
A mechanical system is '''rheonomous''' if its equations of [[Constraint (classical mechanics)|constraints]] contain the time as an explicit variable.{{cite book |last=Goldstein |first=Herbert |authorlink=Herbert Goldstein |title=Classical Mechanics |year=1980 |location=United States of Americ
 a |publisher=Addison Wesley |edition=2nd |isbn=0-201-02918-9 |page=12 |quote=Constraints are further classified according as the equations of constraint contain the time as an explicit variable (rheonomous) or are not explicitly dependent on time (scleronomous).}}1 Such constraints are called rheonomic constraints. The opposite of rheonomous is scleronomous.23
Example: simple 2D pendulum
 As shown at right, a simple pendulum is a system composed of a weight and a string. The string is attached at the top end to a pivot and at the bottom end to a weight. Being inextensible, the string has a constant length. Therefore this system is scleronomous; it obeys the scleronomic constraint


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the position of the weight and 
 
 
 
  the length of the string.
 The situation changes if the pivot point is moving, e.g. undergoing a simple harmonic motion


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the amplitude, 
 
 
 
  the angular frequency, and 
 
 
 
  time.
Although the top end of the string is not fixed, the length of this inextensible string is still a constant. The distance between the top end and the weight must stay the same. Therefore this system is rheonomous; it obeys the rheonomic constraint
