   TC0      TC0    TC 0 is a complexity class used in circuit complexity . It is the first class in the hierarchy of TC classes.  TC 0 contains all languages which are decided by Boolean circuits with constant depth and polynomial size, containing only unbounded-fanin AND gates , OR gates , NOT gates , and majority gates . Equivalently, threshold gates can be used instead of majority gates.  TC 0 contains several important problems, such as sorting n  n -bit numbers, multiplying two n -bit numbers, integer division 1 or recognizing the Dyck language with two types of parentheses.  Complexity class relations  We can relate TC 0 to other circuit classes, including AC 0 and NC 1 ; Vollmer 1999 p. 126 states:         AC  0   ⊊    AC  0    [  p  ]    ⊊   TC  0   ⊆   NC  1    .         superscript  AC  0      superscript  AC  0    delimited-[]  p          superscript  TC  0         superscript  NC  1      \mbox{AC}^{0}\subsetneq\mbox{AC}^{0}[p]\subsetneq\mbox{TC}^{0}\subseteq\mbox{%
 NC}^{1}.      Vollmer states that the question of whether the last inclusion above is strict is "one of the main open problems in circuit complexity" (ibid.).  We also have that uniform     TC  0   ⊊  PP       superscript  TC  0   PP    \mbox{TC}^{0}\subsetneq\mbox{PP}   . (Allender 1996, as cited in Burtschick 1999).
