Gauss–Hermite quadrature

 In numerical analysis, Gauss–Hermite quadrature is a form of Gaussian quadrature for approximating the value of integrals of the following kind:



In this case



where n is the number of sample points used. The xi are the roots of the physicists' version of the Hermite polynomial Hn(x) (i = 1,2,...,n), and the associated weights wi are given by 1



Example with change of variable
Let's take a function h which variable y is Normally distributed 
 
 
 
 . The expectation of h corresponds to the following integral:



As this doesn't exactly correspond to the Hermite polynomial, we need a change of variable:



Coupled with the integration by substitution, we obtain:



leading to:
