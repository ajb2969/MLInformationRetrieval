In mathematics, in linear algebra, a Weyr canonical form (or, Weyr form or Weyr matrix) is a square matrix satisfying certain conditions. A square matrix is said to be in the Weyr canonical form if the matrix satisfies the conditions defining the Weyr canonical form. The Weyr form was discovered by the Czech mathematician Eduard Weyr in 1885.123 The Weyr form did not become popular among mathematicians and it was overshadowed by the closely related, but distinct, canonical form known by the name Jordan canonical form.4 The Weyr form has been rediscovered several times since Weyr’s original discovery in 1885.5 This form has been variously called as modified Jordan form, reordered Jordan form, second Jordan form, and H-form.6 The current terminology is credited to Shapiro who introduced it in a paper published in the American Mathematical Monthly in 1999.78
Recently several applications have been found for the Weyr matrix. Of particular interest is an application of the Weyr matrix in the study of phylogenetic invariants in biomathematics.

Definition
A basic Weyr matrix with eigenvalue

 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix 
 
 
 
  of the following form: There is a partition


 
  of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  such that, when 
 
 
 
  is viewed as an 
 
 
blocked matrix

 
 
 , where the 
 
 
 
  block 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  matrix, the following three features are present:

The main diagonal blocks 
 
 
 
  are the 
 
 
scalar matrices

 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
The first superdiagonal blocks 
 
 
 
  are full column rank

 
  matrices in reduced row-echelon form (that is, an identity matrix followed by zero rows) for 
 
 
 
 
 .
All other blocks of W are zero (that is, 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 ).

In this case, we say that 
 
 
 
  has Weyr structure 
 
 
 
 .

General Weyr matrix
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a square matrix and let 
 
 
 
  be the distinct eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 . We say that 
 
 
 
  is in Weyr form (or is a Weyr matrix) if 
 
 
 
  has the following form:





where 
 
 
 
  is a basic Weyr matrix with eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Example
The following image shows an example of a general Weyr matrix consisting of three basic Weyr matrix blocks. The basic Weyr matrix in the top-left corner has the structure (4,2,1) with eigenvalue 4, the middle block has structure (2,2,1,1) with eigenvalue -3 and the one in the lower-right corner has the structure (3, 2) with eigenvalue 0.

The Weyr form is canonical
That the weyr form is a canonical form of a matrix is a consequence of the following result:9 To within permutation of basic Weyr blocks, each square matrix 
 
 
 
  over an algebraically closed field is similar to a unique Weyr matrix 
 
 
 
 . The matrix 
 
 
 
  is called the Weyr (canonical ) form of 
 
 
 
 .
Computation of the Weyr canonical form
Reduction to the nilpotent case
Let 
 
 
 
  be a square matrix of order 
 
 
 
  over an algebraically closed field and let the distinct eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
 . As a consequence of the generalized eigenspace decomposition theorem, one can show that 
 
 
 
  is similar to a block diagonal matrix of the form



where 
 
 
 
  is a diagonal matrix and 
 
 
 
  is a nilpotent matrix. So the problem of reducing 
 
 
 
  to the Weyr form reduces to the problem of reducing the nilpotent matrices 
 
 
 
  to the Weyr form.
Reduction of a nilpotent matrix to the Weyr form
Given a nilpotent square matrix 
 
 
 
 
  of order 
 
 
 
  over an algebraically closed field 
 
 
 
 , the following algorithm produces an invertible matrix 
 
 
 
  and a Weyr matrix 
 
 
 
  such that

Step 4
Continue the processes of Steps 1 and 2 to obtain increasingly smaller square matrices 
 
 
 
  and associated nvertible matrices

 
  until the first zero matrix 
 
 
 
 
  is obtained.

  contain only 
 
 
 
 's.
Step 10
Repeat Steps 8 and 9 on column 
 
 
 
  converting 
 
 
 
 -block to 
 
 
 
  via conjugation by some invertible matrix 
 
 
 
 
 . Use this block to clear out the blocks above, via conjugation by a product 
 
 
 
  of elementary matrices.
Step 11
Repeat these processes on 
 
 
 
  columns, using conjugations by

 .
Applications of the Weyr form
Some well-known applications of the Weyr form are listed below:10

The Weyr form can be used to simplify the proof of Gerstenhaber’s Theorem which asserts that the subalgebra generated by two commuting 
 
 
 
  matrices has dimension at most 
 
 
 
 .
A set of finite matrices is said to be approximately simultaneously diagonalizable if they can be perturbed to simultaneously diagonalizable matrices. The Weyr form is used to prove approximate simultaneous diagonalizability of various classes of matrices. The approximate simultaneous diagonalizability property has applications in the study of phylogenetic invariants in biomathematics.
The Weyr form can be used to simplify the proofs of the irreducibility of the variety of all k-tuples of commuting complex matrices.
