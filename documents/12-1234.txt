Bismut connection

In mathematics, the Bismut connection 
 
 
 is the unique connection on a complex Hermitian manifold that satisfies the following conditions,

It preserves the metric 
 
 

It preserves the complex structure 
 
 

The torsion

 
  contracted with the metric, i.e. 
 
 
 
 , is totally skew-symmetric.

Bismut has used this connection when proving a local index formula for the Dolbeault operator on non-KÃ¤hler manifolds. Bismut connection has applications in type II and heterotic string theory.
The explicit construction goes as follows. Let 
 
 
 
 
  denote the pairng of two vectors using the metric that is Hermitian w.r.t the complex structure, i.e. 
 
 
 
 . Further let 
 
 
 
  be the Levi-Civita connection. Define first a tensor 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . It is easy to see that this tensor is anti-symmetric in the first and last entry, i.e. the new connection 
 
 
 
 
  still preserves the metric. In concrete terms, the new connection is given by 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  being the Levi-Civita connection. It is also easy to see that the new connection preserves the complex structure. However, the tensor 
 
 
 
  is not yet totall anti-symmetric, in fact the anti-symmetrization will lead to the Nijenhuis tensor. Denote the anti-symmetrization as 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 
  given explicitly as


 
  We show that 
 
 
 
  still preserves the complex structure (that it preserves the metric is easy to see), i.e. 
 
 
 
 .


 
 
  So if 
 
 
 
  is integrable, then above term vanishes, and the connection


 
  gives the Bismut connection.
