   Cauchy's integral formula      Cauchy's integral formula   In mathematics , Cauchy's integral formula , named after Augustin-Louis Cauchy , is a central statement in complex analysis . It expresses the fact that a holomorphic function defined on a disk is completely determined by its values on the boundary of the disk, and it provides integral formulas for all derivatives of a holomorphic function. Cauchy's formula shows that, in complex analysis, "differentiation is equivalent to integration": complex differentiation, like integration, behaves well under uniform limits – a result denied in real analysis .  Theorem  Suppose U is an open subset of the complex plane  C , f : U → C is a holomorphic function and the closed disk D = { z : | z − z 0 | ≤ r } is completely contained in U . Let   γ   γ   \gamma   be the circle forming the boundary of D . Then for every a in the interior of D :       f   (  a  )    =    1   2  π  i      ∮  γ       f   (  z  )     z  -  a     d  z           f  a       1    2  π  i      subscript  contour-integral  γ         f  z     z  a    d  z       f(a)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{\gamma}\frac{f(z)}{z-a}\,dz     where the contour integral is taken counter-clockwise .  The proof of this statement uses the Cauchy integral theorem and similarly only requires f to be complex differentiable . Since the reciprocal of the denominator of the integrand in Cauchy's integral formula can be expanded as a power series in the variable ( a − z 0 ), it follows that holomorphic functions are analytic . In particular f is actually infinitely differentiable, with         f   (  n  )     (  a  )    =     n  !    2  π  i      ∮  γ       f   (  z  )      (   z  -  a   )    n  +  1      d  z      .         superscript  f  n   a         n     2  π  i      subscript  contour-integral  γ         f  z    superscript    z  a     n  1     d  z       f^{(n)}(a)=\frac{n!}{2\pi i}\oint_{\gamma}\frac{f(z)}{(z-a)^{n+1}}\,dz.   This formula is sometimes referred to as Cauchy's differentiation formula .  The circle γ can be replaced by any closed rectifiable curve in U which has winding number one about a . Moreover, as for the Cauchy integral theorem, it is sufficient to require that f be holomorphic in the open region enclosed by the path and continuous on its closure .  Proof sketch  By using the Cauchy integral theorem, one can show that the integral over C (or the closed rectifiable curve) is equal to the same integral taken over an arbitrarily small circle around a . Since f ( z ) is continuous, we can choose a circle small enough on which f ( z ) is arbitrarily close to f ( a ). On the other hand, the integral         ∮  C      1   z  -  a     d  z    =   2  π  i    ,        subscript  contour-integral  C       1    z  a    d  z      2  π  i     \oint_{C}\frac{1}{z-a}\,dz=2\pi i,     over any circle C centered at a . This can be calculated directly via a parametrization ( integration by substitution )     z   (  t  )    =   a  +   ε   e   i  t            z  t     a    ε   superscript  e    i  t        z(t)=a+\varepsilon e^{it}   where 0 ≤ t ≤ 2 π and ε is the radius of the circle.  Letting ε → 0 gives the desired estimate      |      1   2  π  i        ∮  C         f   (  z  )     z  -  a      d  z     -   f   (  a  )     |            1    2  π  i      subscript  contour-integral  C         f  z     z  a    d  z       f  a      \displaystyle\left|\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{C}\frac{f(z)}{z-a}\,dz-f(a)\right|     Example  Let       g   (  z  )    =    z  2     z  2   +   2  z   +  2          g  z      superscript  z  2      superscript  z  2     2  z   2      g(z)=\frac{z^{2}}{z^{2}+2z+2}   ,  and let C be the contour described by | z | = 2 (i.e. the circle of radius 2).  To find the integral of g ( z ) around the contour C , we need to know the singularities of g ( z ). Observe that we can rewrite g as follows:       g   (  z  )    =    z  2     (   z  -   z  1    )    (   z  -   z  2    )           g  z      superscript  z  2       z   subscript  z  1      z   subscript  z  2        g(z)=\frac{z^{2}}{(z-z_{1})(z-z_{2})}   where      z  1   =    -  1   +  i    ,       subscript  z  1       1   i     z_{1}=-1+i,         z  2   =    -  1   -  i    .       subscript  z  2       1   i     z_{2}=-1-i.     Thus, g has poles at    z  1     subscript  z  1    z_{1}   and    z  2     subscript  z  2    z_{2}   . The moduli of these points are less than 2 and thus lie inside the contour. This integral can be split into two smaller integrals by Cauchy-Goursat theorem ; that is, we can express the integral around the contour as the sum of the integral around z 1 and z 2 where the contour is a small circle around each pole. Call these contours C 1 around z 1 and C 2 around z 2 .  Now, each of these smaller integrals can be solved by the Cauchy integral formula, but they first must be rewritten to apply the theorem. For the integral around C 1 , define f 1 ) as f 1 )( z )=( z - z 1 ) g ( z ). This is analytic (since the contour does not contain the other singularity). We can simplify f 1 ) to be:        f  1    (  z  )    =    z  2    z  -   z  2            subscript  f  1   z      superscript  z  2     z   subscript  z  2       f_{1}(z)=\frac{z^{2}}{z-z_{2}}     and now       g   (  z  )    =     f  1    (  z  )     z  -   z  1           g  z        subscript  f  1   z     z   subscript  z  1       g(z)=\frac{f_{1}(z)}{z-z_{1}}   .  Since the Cauchy integral theorem says that:        ∮  C        f  1    (  z  )     z  -  a     d  z    =     2  π  i   ⋅   f  1     (  a  )          subscript  contour-integral  C          subscript  f  1   z     z  a    d  z       normal-⋅    2  π  i    subscript  f  1    a     \oint_{C}\frac{f_{1}(z)}{z-a}\,dz=2\pi i\cdot f_{1}(a)   ,  we can evaluate the integral as follows:         ∮   C  1     g   (  z  )   d  z    =    ∮   C  1         f  1    (  z  )     z  -   z  1      d  z    =   2  π  i    z  1  2     z  1   -   z  2       .          subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  1      g  z  d  z      subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  1           subscript  f  1   z     z   subscript  z  1     d  z           2  π  i     superscript   subscript  z  1   2      subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2         \oint_{C_{1}}g(z)\,dz=\oint_{C_{1}}\frac{f_{1}(z)}{z-z_{1}}\,dz=2\pi i\frac{z_%
 {1}^{2}}{z_{1}-z_{2}}.     Doing likewise for the other contour:         f  2    (  z  )    =    z  2    z  -   z  1      ,         subscript  f  2   z      superscript  z  2     z   subscript  z  1       f_{2}(z)=\frac{z^{2}}{z-z_{1}},            ∮   C  2     g   (  z  )   d  z    =    ∮   C  2         f  2    (  z  )     z  -   z  2      d  z    =   2  π  i    z  2  2     z  2   -   z  1       .          subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  2      g  z  d  z      subscript  contour-integral   subscript  C  2           subscript  f  2   z     z   subscript  z  2     d  z           2  π  i     superscript   subscript  z  2   2      subscript  z  2    subscript  z  1         \oint_{C_{2}}g(z)\,dz=\oint_{C_{2}}\frac{f_{2}(z)}{z-z_{2}}\,dz=2\pi i\frac{z_%
 {2}^{2}}{z_{2}-z_{1}}.     The integral around the original contour C then is the sum of these two integrals:        ∮  C     g   (  z  )   d  z       subscript  contour-integral  C     g  z  d  z     \displaystyle\oint_{C}g(z)\,dz    An elementary trick using partial fraction decomposition :        ∮  C    g   (  z  )   d  z    =    ∮  C     (   1  -   1   z  -   z  1     -   1   z  -   z  2      )   d  z    =   0  -   2  π  i   -   2  π  i    =   -   4  π  i            subscript  contour-integral  C     g  z  d  z      subscript  contour-integral  C       1    1    z   subscript  z  1       1    z   subscript  z  2      d  z           0    2  π  i     2  π  i             4  π  i       \oint_{C}g(z)dz=\oint_{C}\left(1-\frac{1}{z-z_{1}}-\frac{1}{z-z_{2}}\right)dz=%
 0-2\pi i-2\pi i=-4\pi i     Consequences  The integral formula has broad applications. First, it implies that a function which is holomorphic in an open set is in fact infinitely differentiable there. Furthermore, it is an analytic function , meaning that it can be represented as a power series . The proof of this uses the dominated convergence theorem and the geometric series applied to        f   (  ζ  )    =    1   2  π  i      ∫  C       f   (  z  )     z  -  ζ     d  z      .        f  ζ       1    2  π  i      subscript   C         f  z     z  ζ    d  z       f(\zeta)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{C}\frac{f(z)}{z-\zeta}\,dz.     The formula is also used to prove the residue theorem , which is a result for meromorphic functions , and a related result, the argument principle . It is known from Morera's theorem that the uniform limit of holomorphic functions is holomorphic. This can also be deduced from Cauchy's integral formula: indeed the formula also holds in the limit and the integrand, and hence the integral, can be expanded as a power series. In addition the Cauchy formulas for the higher order derivatives show that all these derivatives also converge uniformly.  The analog of the Cauchy integral formula in real analysis is the Poisson integral formula for harmonic functions ; many of the results for holomorphic functions carry over to this setting. No such results, however, are valid for more general classes of differentiable or real analytic functions. For instance, the existence of the first derivative of a real function need not imply the existence of higher order derivatives, nor in particular the analyticity of the function. Likewise, the uniform limit of a sequence of (real) differentiable functions may fail to be differentiable, or may be differentiable but with a derivative which is not the limit of the derivatives of the members of the sequence.  Another consequence is that if is holomorphic in | z |  satisfy Cauchy's inequality 1        |   a  n   |   ≤    r   -  n      sup    |  z  |   =  r     |   f   (  z  )    |      .         subscript  a  n       superscript  r    n      subscript  supremum      z   r        f  z        \displaystyle{|a_{n}|\leq r^{-n}\sup_{|z|=r}|f(z)|.}     Generalizations  Smooth functions  A version of Cauchy's integral formula is the Cauchy- Pompeiu formula, 2 and holds for smooth functions as well, as it is based on Stokes' theorem . Let D be a disc in C and suppose that f is a complex-valued C 1 function on the closure of D . Then        f   (  ζ  )    =     1   2  π  i      ∫   ∂  D      f   (  z  )   d  z    z  -  ζ      +    1   2  π  i      ∬  D      ∂  f    ∂   z  ¯      (  z  )      d  z   ∧   d   z  ¯      z  -  ζ         .        f  ζ         1    2  π  i      subscript     D        f  z  d  z     z  ζ          1    2  π  i      subscript  double-integral  D         f      normal-¯  z     z        d  z     d   normal-¯  z       z  ζ          f(\zeta)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{\partial D}\frac{f(z)dz}{z-\zeta}+\frac{1}{2\pi

 \zeta}.     One may use this representation formula to solve the inhomogeneous Cauchy–Riemann equations in D . Indeed, if φ is a function in D , then a particular solution f of the equation is a holomorphic function outside the support of μ . Moreover, if in an open set D ,       d  μ   =     1   2  π  i     ϕ   d  z   ∧   d   z  ¯           d  μ         1    2  π  i    ϕ  d  z     d   normal-¯  z       d\mu=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\phi\,dz\wedge d\bar{z}     for some φ ∈ C k ( D ) ( k ≥ 1), then    f   (  ζ  ,   ζ  ¯   )       f   ζ   normal-¯  ζ      f(\zeta,\bar{\zeta})   is also in C k ( D ) and satisfies the equation         ∂  f    ∂   z  ¯     =   ϕ   (  z  ,   z  ¯   )     .          f      normal-¯  z       ϕ   z   normal-¯  z       \frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}}=\phi(z,\bar{z}).     The first conclusion is, succinctly, that the convolution  μ ∗ k ( z ) of a compactly supported measure with the Cauchy kernel       k   (  z  )    =    p  .  v  .    1  z          k  z     fragments  p  normal-.  v  normal-.     1  z      k(z)=\operatorname{p.v.}\frac{1}{z}     is a holomorphic function off the support of μ . Here p.v. denotes the principal value . The second conclusion asserts that the Cauchy kernel is a fundamental solution of the Cauchy–Riemann equations. Note that for smooth complex-valued functions f of compact support on C the generalized Cauchy integral formula simplifies to        f   (  ζ  )    =    1   2  π  i     ∬     ∂  f    ∂   z  ¯        d  z   ∧   d   z  ¯      z  -  ζ        ,        f  ζ       1    2  π  i     double-integral        f      normal-¯  z           d  z     d   normal-¯  z       z  ζ         f(\zeta)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\iint\frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}}\frac{dz\wedge

Let D be the polydisc given as the Cartesian product of n open discs D 1 , ..., D n :       D  =    ∏   i  =  1   n    D  i     .      D    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    subscript  D  i      D=\prod_{i=1}^{n}D_{i}.   Suppose that f is a holomorphic function in D continuous on the closure of D . Then       f   (  ζ  )    =    1    (   2  π  i   )   n     ∫   ⋯    ∬    ∂    D  1   ×  …    ×   ∂   D  n          f   (   z  1   ,  …  ,   z  n   )      (    z  1   -   ζ  1    )   …   (    z  n   -   ζ  n    )      d   z  1   ⋯  d   z  n              f  ζ       1   superscript    2  π  i   n        normal-⋯    subscript  double-integral         subscript  D  1   normal-…       subscript  D  n            f    subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z  n          subscript  z  1    subscript  ζ  1    normal-…     subscript  z  n    subscript  ζ  n      d   subscript  z  1   normal-⋯  d   subscript  z  n          f(\zeta)=\frac{1}{(2\pi i)^{n}}\int\cdots\iint_{\partial D_{1}\times\dots%

 \zeta_{n})}\,dz_{1}\cdots dz_{n}     where ζ = ( ζ 1 ,..., ζ n ) ∈ D .  In real algebras  The Cauchy integral formula is generalizable to real vector spaces of two or more dimensions. The insight into this property comes from geometric algebra , where objects beyond scalars and vectors (such as planar bivectors and volumetric trivectors) are considered, and a proper generalization of Stokes theorem .  Geometric calculus defines a derivative operator    ∇  =     e  ^   i    ∂  i        normal-∇     subscript   normal-^  e   i    subscript   i      \nabla=\hat{e}_{i}\partial_{i}   under its geometric product—that is, for a   k   k   k   -vector field    ψ   (   r  →   )       ψ   normal-→  r     \psi(\vec{r})   , the derivative    ∇  ψ     normal-∇  ψ    \nabla\psi   generally contains terms of grade    k  +  1      k  1    k+1   and    k  -  1      k  1    k-1   . For example, a vector field (    k  =  1      k  1    k=1   ) generally has in its derivative a scalar part, the divergence (    k  =  0      k  0    k=0   ), and a bivector part, the curl (    k  =  2      k  2    k=2   ). This particular derivative operator has a Green's function :       G   (   r  →   ,    r  →   ′   )    =    1   S  n       r  →   -    r  →   ′      |    r  →   -    r  →   ′    |   n           G    normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′         1   subscript  S  n         normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′     superscript       normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′     n       G(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})=\frac{1}{S_{n}}\frac{\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}}{|%
 \vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime}|^{n}}     where    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   is the surface area of a unit ball in the space (that is,     S  2   =   2  π        subscript  S  2     2  π     S_{2}=2\pi   , the circumference of a circle with radius 1, and     S  3   =   4  π        subscript  S  3     4  π     S_{3}=4\pi   , the surface area of a sphere with radius 1). By definition of a Green's function,      ∇  G    (   r  →   ,    r  →   ′   )    =   δ   (    r  →   -    r  →   ′    )           normal-∇  G     normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′       δ     normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′       \nabla G(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})=\delta(\vec{r}-\vec{r}^{\prime})   . It is this useful property that can be used, in conjunction with the generalized Stokes theorem:        ∮   ∂  V     d    S  →    f   (   r  →   )     =    ∫  V    d    V  →     ∇  f    (   r  →   )           subscript  contour-integral    V      d   normal-→  S   f   normal-→  r       subscript   V     d   normal-→  V    normal-∇  f    normal-→  r       \oint_{\partial V}d\vec{S}\;f(\vec{r})=\int_{V}d\vec{V}\;\nabla f(\vec{r})     where, for an   n   n   n   -dimensional vector space,    d   S  →       d   normal-→  S     d\vec{S}   is an    (   n  -  1   )      n  1    (n-1)   -vector and    d   V  →       d   normal-→  V     d\vec{V}   is an   n   n   n   -vector. The function    f   (   r  →   )       f   normal-→  r     f(\vec{r})   can, in principle, be composed of any combination of multivectors. The proof of Cauchy's integral theorem for higher dimensional spaces relies on the using the generalized Stokes theorem on the quantity    G   (   r  →   ,    r  →   ′   )   f   (    r  →   ′   )       G    normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′    f   superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′     G(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})f(\vec{r}^{\prime})   and use of the product rule:        ∮   ∂   V  ′      G   (   r  →   ,    r  →   ′   )   d     S  →   ′    f   (    r  →   ′   )     =    ∫  V     (     [     ∇  ′   G    (   r  →   ,    r  →   ′   )    ]   f   (    r  →   ′   )    +   G   (   r  →   ,    r  →   ′   )     ∇  ′   f    (    r  →   ′   )     )   d   V  →           subscript  contour-integral     superscript  V  normal-′       G    normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′    d   superscript   normal-→  S   normal-′   f   superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′       subscript   V          delimited-[]      superscript  normal-∇  normal-′   G     normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′      f   superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′      G    normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′      superscript  normal-∇  normal-′   f    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′     d   normal-→  V       \oint_{\partial V^{\prime}}G(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})\;d\vec{S}^{\prime}\;f(%

When that condition is met, the second term in the right-hand integral vanishes, leaving only        ∮   ∂   V  ′      G   (   r  →   ,    r  →   ′   )   d     S  →   ′    f   (    r  →   ′   )     =    ∫  V     [     ∇  ′   G    (   r  →   ,    r  →   ′   )    ]   f   (    r  →   ′   )     =   -    ∫  V    δ   (    r  →   -    r  →   ′    )   f   (    r  →   ′   )   d   V  →      =   -    i  n   f   (   r  →   )             subscript  contour-integral     superscript  V  normal-′       G    normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′    d   superscript   normal-→  S   normal-′   f   superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′       subscript   V      delimited-[]      superscript  normal-∇  normal-′   G     normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′      f   superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′              subscript   V     δ     normal-→  r    superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′    f   superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′   d   normal-→  V                subscript  i  n   f   normal-→  r        \oint_{\partial V^{\prime}}G(\vec{r},\vec{r}^{\prime})\;d\vec{S}^{\prime}\;f(%
