   Atomic formula      Atomic formula   In mathematical logic , an atomic formula (also known simply as an atom ) is a formula with no deeper propositional structure, that is, a formula that contains no logical connectives or equivalently a formula that has no strict subformulas . Atoms are thus the simplest well-formed formulas of the logic. Compound formulas are formed by combining the atomic formulas using the logical connectives.  The precise form of atomic formulas depends on the logic under consideration; for propositional logic , for example, the atomic formulas are the propositional variables . For predicate logic , the atoms are predicate symbols together with their arguments, each argument being a term . In model theory , atomic formula are merely strings of symbols with a given signature , which may or may not be satisfiable with respect to a given model. 1  Atomic formula in first-order logic  The well-formed terms and propositions of ordinary first-order logic have the following syntax :  Terms :       t  ≡   c   ∣  x  ∣   f   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )        t    c   delimited-∣∣  x   f    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n       t\equiv c\mid x\mid f(t_{1},...,t_{n})   ,   that is, a term is recursively defined to be a constant c (a named object from the domain of discourse ), or a variable x (ranging over the objects in the domain of discourse), or an n -ary function f whose arguments are terms t k . Functions map tuples of objects to objects.  Propositions:       A  ,  B  ,  …  ≡  P   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )   ∣  A  ∧  B  ∣  ⊤  ∣  A  ∨  B  ∣  ⊥  ∣  A  ⊃  B  ∣  ∀  x  .  A  ∣  ∃  x  .  A     fragments  A  normal-,  B  normal-,  normal-…   P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  t  1   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  t  n   normal-)   normal-∣  A   B  normal-∣  top  normal-∣  A   B  normal-∣  bottom  normal-∣  A  superset-of  B  normal-∣  for-all  x  normal-.  A  normal-∣   x  normal-.  A    A,B,...\equiv P(t_{1},...,t_{n})\mid A\wedge B\mid\top\mid A\vee B\mid\bot\mid

 \supset B\mid\forall x.\ A\mid\exists x.\ A   ,   that is, a proposition is recursively defined to be an n -ary predicate  P whose arguments are terms t k , or an expression composed of logical connectives (and, or) and quantifiers (for-all, there-exists) used with other propositions.  An atomic formula or atom is simply a predicate applied to a tuple of terms; that is, an atomic formula is a formula of the form P ( t 1 , …, t n ) for P a predicate, and the t k terms.  All other well-formed formulae are obtained by composing atoms with logical connectives and quantifiers.  For example, the formula ∀ x. P ( x ) ∧ ∃ y. Q ( y , f ( x )) ∨ ∃ z. R ( z ) contains the atoms       P   (  x  )       P  x    P(x)         Q   (  y  ,   f   (  x  )    )       Q   y    f  x      Q(y,f(x))         R   (  z  )       R  z    R(z)      When all of the terms in an atom are ground terms , then the atom is called a ground atom or ground predicate .
