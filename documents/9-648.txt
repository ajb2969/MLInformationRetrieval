   Retention uniformity      Retention uniformity   Retention uniformity , or R U , is a concept in thin layer chromatography , designed for quantitative measurement of equal-spreading of the spots on the chromatographic plate and one of the Chromatographic response functions .  Formula  Retention uniformity is calculated from the following formula:       R  U   =   1  -      6   (   n  +  1   )     n   (    2  n   +  1   )       ∑   i  =  1   n     (    R   F  i    -   i   n  +  1     )   2            subscript  R  U     1          6    n  1      n      2  n   1       superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript     subscript  R    F  i      i    n  1     2         R_{U}=1-\sqrt{\frac{6(n+1)}{n(2n+1)}\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\left(R_{Fi}-\frac{i}{n+1}%
 \right)^{2}}}     where n is the number of compounds separated, R f (1...n) are the Retention factor of the compounds sorted in non-descending order.  Theoretical considerations  The coefficient lies always in range  and 0 indicates worst case of separation (all R f values equal to 0 or 1), value 1 indicates ideal equal-spreading of the spots, for example (0.25,0.5,0.75) for three solutes, or (0.2,0.4,0.6,0.8) for four solutes.  This coefficient was proposed as an alternative to earlier approaches, such as D (separation response), I p (performance index) or S m (informational entropy). Besides its stable range, the advantage is a stable distribution as a random variable, regardless of compounds investigated.  In contrast to the similar concept called Retention distance , R u is insensitive to R f values close to 0 or 1, or close to themselves. If two values are not separated, it still indicates some uniformity of chromatographic system. For example the R f values (0,0.2,0.2,0.3) (two compounds not separated at 0.2 and one at the start ) result in R U equal to 0.3609.
