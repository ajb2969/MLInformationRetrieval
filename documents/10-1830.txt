Cinnamoyl-CoA:phenyllactate CoA-transferase

In enzymology, a cinnamoyl-CoA:phenyllactate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(E)-cinnamoyl-CoA + (R)-phenyllactate 
 
 
 
  (E)-cinnamate + (R)-phenyllactyl-CoA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (E)-cinnamoyl-CoA and (R)-phenyllactate, whereas its two products are (E)-cinnamate and (R)-phenyllactyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, to be specific, the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (E)-cinnamoyl-CoA:(R)-phenyllactate CoA-transferase. This enzyme is also called FldA.
