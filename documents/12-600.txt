   Transient equilibrium      Transient equilibrium   In nuclear physics , transient equilibrium is a situation in which equilibrium is reached by a parent-daughter radioactive  isotope pair where the half-life of the daughter is shorter than the half-life of the parent. Contrary to secular equilibrium , the half-life of the daughter is not negligible compared to parent's half-life. An example of this is a molybdenum-99 generator producing technetium-99 for nuclear medicine diagnostic procedures. Such a generator is sometimes called a '' cow '' because the daughter product, in this case technetium-99, is milked at regular intervals. 1 Transient equilibrium occurs after four half-lives, on average.  Activity in transient equilibrium  The activity of the daughter is given by the Bateman equation:       A  d   =    (     [     A  P    (  0  )     λ  d     λ  d   -   λ  P      ×   (    e   -    λ  P   t     -   e   -    λ  d   t      )    ]   ×  B   R   )   +    A  d    (  0  )    e   -    λ  d   t            subscript  A  d          delimited-[]       subscript  A  P   0     subscript  λ  d      subscript  λ  d    subscript  λ  P         superscript  e       subscript  λ  P   t      superscript  e       subscript  λ  d   t        B   R      subscript  A  d   0   superscript  e       subscript  λ  d   t         A_{d}=([A_{P}(0)\frac{\lambda_{d}}{\lambda_{d}-\lambda_{P}}\times(e^{-\lambda_%
 {P}t}-e^{-\lambda_{d}t})]\times BR)+A_{d}(0)e^{-\lambda_{d}t}   ,  where    A  P     subscript  A  P    A_{P}   and    A  d     subscript  A  d    A_{d}   are the activity of the parent and daughter, respectively.    T  P     subscript  T  P    T_{P}   and    T  d     subscript  T  d    T_{d}   are the half-lives of the parent and daughter, respectively, and BR is the branching ratio .  In transient equilibrium, the Bateman equation cannot be simplified by assuming the daughter's half-life is negligible compared to the parent's half-life. The ratio of daughter-to-parent activity is given by:        A  d    A  P    =      T  P     T  P   -   T  d     ×  B   R          subscript  A  d    subscript  A  P           subscript  T  P      subscript  T  P    subscript  T  d     B   R     \frac{A_{d}}{A_{P}}=\frac{T_{P}}{T_{P}-T_{d}}\times BR   .  Time of maximum daughter activity  In transient equilibrium, the daughter activity increases and eventually reaches a maximum value that can exceed the parent activity. The time of maximum activity is given by:       t   m  a  x    =       1.44  ×   T  P     T  d      T  P   -   T  d     ×  l   n   (    T  P   /   T  d    )         subscript  t    m  a  x              1.44   subscript  T  P     subscript  T  d       subscript  T  P    subscript  T  d     l   n     subscript  T  P    subscript  T  d       t_{max}=\frac{1.44\times T_{P}T_{d}}{T_{P}-T_{d}}\times ln(T_{P}/T_{d})   ,  where    T  P     subscript  T  P    T_{P}   and    T  d     subscript  T  d    T_{d}   are the half-lives of the parent and daughter, respectively. In the case of     T     99  m    c       superscript  T    99  m    c    {}^{99m}Tc   -     M    99   o       superscript  M  99   o    {}^{99}Mo   generator, the time of maximum activity (    t   m  a  x      subscript  t    m  a  x     t_{max}   ) is approximately 24 hours which makes it convenient for medical use. 2  See also   Bateman Equation  Secular equilibrium   References    "  Category:Radioactivity     transient equilibrium  ↩  ↩
