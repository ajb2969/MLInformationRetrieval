   Quantum calculus      Quantum calculus   Quantum calculus , sometimes called calculus without limits , is equivalent to traditional infinitesimal calculus without the notion of limits . It defines "q-calculus" and "h-calculus", where h ostensibly stands for Planck's constant while q stands for quantum. The two parameters are related by the formula      q  =   e   i  h    =    e   2  π  i  ℏ           q   superscript  e    i  h          superscript  e    2  π  i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi       q=e^{ih}=e^{2\pi i\hbar}\,     where    ℏ  =     h   2  π          Planck-constant-over-2-pi    h    2  π      \scriptstyle\hbar=\frac{h}{2\pi}\,   is the reduced Planck constant .  Differentiation  In the q-calculus and h-calculus, differentials of functions are defined as        d  q    (   f   (  x  )    )    =    f   (   q  x   )    -   f   (  x  )            subscript  d  q     f  x        f    q  x      f  x      d_{q}(f(x))=f(qx)-f(x)\,     and        d  h    (   f   (  x  )    )    =    f   (   x  +  h   )    -   f   (  x  )            subscript  d  h     f  x        f    x  h      f  x      d_{h}(f(x))=f(x+h)-f(x)\,     respectively. Derivatives of functions are then defined as fractions by the q-derivative        D  q    (   f   (  x  )    )    =     d  q    (   f   (  x  )    )      d  q    (  x  )     =     f   (   q  x   )    -   f   (  x  )       (   q  -  1   )   x             subscript  D  q     f  x         subscript  d  q     f  x       subscript  d  q   x               f    q  x      f  x        q  1   x       D_{q}(f(x))=\frac{d_{q}(f(x))}{d_{q}(x)}=\frac{f(qx)-f(x)}{(q-1)x}     and by        D  h    (   f   (  x  )    )    =     d  h    (   f   (  x  )    )      d  h    (  x  )     =     f   (   x  +  h   )    -   f   (  x  )     h            subscript  D  h     f  x         subscript  d  h     f  x       subscript  d  h   x               f    x  h      f  x    h      D_{h}(f(x))=\frac{d_{h}(f(x))}{d_{h}(x)}=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}     In the limit , as h goes to 0, or equivalently as q goes to 1, these expressions take on the form of the derivative of classical calculus.  Integration  q-integral  A function F(x) is a q-antiderivative of f(x) if D q F(x)=f(x). The q-antiderivative (or q-integral) is denoted by    ∫   f   (  x  )    d  q   x         f  x   subscript  d  q   x     \int f(x)d_{q}x   and an expression for F(x) can be found from the formula     ∫   f   (  x  )    d  q   x    =    (   1  -  q   )     ∑   j  =  0   ∞    x   q  j   f   (   x   q  j    )              f  x   subscript  d  q   x        1  q     superscript   subscript     j  0        x   superscript  q  j   f    x   superscript  q  j         \int f(x)d_{q}x=(1-q)\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}xq^{j}f(xq^{j})   which is called the Jackson integral of f(x). For 0 j, with the jump at the point q j being q j . If we call this step function g q (t) then dg q (t) = d q t. 1  h-integral  A function F(x) is an h-antiderivative of f(x) if D h F(x)=f(x). The h-antiderivative (or h-integral) is denoted by    ∫   f   (  x  )    d  h   x         f  x   subscript  d  h   x     \int f(x)d_{h}x   . If a and b differ by an integer multiple of h then the definite integral     ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )    d  h   x       superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x   subscript  d  h   x     \int_{a}^{b}f(x)d_{h}x   is given by a Riemann sum of f(x) on the interval [a,b] partitioned into subintervals of width h.  Example  The derivative of the function    x  n     superscript  x  n    x^{n}   (for some positive integer   n   n   n   ) in the classical calculus is    n   x   n  -  1        n   superscript  x    n  1      nx^{n-1}   . The corresponding expressions in q-calculus and h-calculus are        D  q    (   x  n   )    =      q  n   -  1    q  -  1     x   n  -  1     =      [  n  ]   q     x   n  -  1              subscript  D  q    superscript  x  n           superscript  q  n   1     q  1     superscript  x    n  1             subscript   delimited-[]  n   q    superscript  x    n  1        D_{q}(x^{n})=\frac{q^{n}-1}{q-1}x^{n-1}=[n]_{q}\ x^{n-1}     with the q-bracket        [  n  ]   q   =     q  n   -  1    q  -  1         subscript   delimited-[]  n   q        superscript  q  n   1     q  1      [n]_{q}=\frac{q^{n}-1}{q-1}     and        D  h    (   x  n   )    =    x   n  -  1    +   h   x   n  -  2     +  ⋯  +   h   n  -  1            subscript  D  h    superscript  x  n       superscript  x    n  1      h   superscript  x    n  2     normal-⋯   superscript  h    n  1       D_{h}(x^{n})=x^{n-1}+hx^{n-2}+\cdots+h^{n-1}     respectively. The expression      [  n  ]   q    x   n  -  1         subscript   delimited-[]  n   q    superscript  x    n  1      [n]_{q}x^{n-1}   is then the q-calculus analogue of the simple power rule for positive integral powers. In this sense, the function    x  n     superscript  x  n    x^{n}   is still nice in the q-calculus, but rather ugly in the h-calculus – the h-calculus analog of    x  n     superscript  x  n    x^{n}   is instead the falling factorial ,       (  x  )   n   :=   x   (   x  -  1   )   ⋯   (    x  -  n   +  1   )     .     assign   subscript  x  n     x    x  1   normal-⋯      x  n   1      (x)_{n}:=x(x-1)\cdots(x-n+1).   One may proceed further and develop, for example, equivalent notions of Taylor expansion , et cetera, and even arrive at q-calculus analogues for all of the usual functions one would want to have, such as an analogue for the sine function whose q-derivative is the appropriate analogue for the cosine .  History  The h-calculus is just the calculus of finite differences , which had been studied by George Boole and others, and has proven useful in a number of fields, among them combinatorics and fluid mechanics . The q-calculus, while dating in a sense back to Leonhard Euler and Carl Gustav Jacobi , is only recently beginning to see more usefulness in quantum mechanics , having an intimate connection with commutativity relations and Lie algebra .
