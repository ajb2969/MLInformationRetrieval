Myristoyl-CoA 11-(E) desaturase

In enzymology, a myristoyl-CoA 11-(E) desaturase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

myristoyl-CoA + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

 
  (E)-11-tetradecenoyl-CoA + NAD(P)+ + 2 H2O
 

The 5 substrates of this enzyme are myristoyl-CoA, NADH, NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas its 4 products are (E)-11-tetradecenoyl-CoA, NAD+, NADP+, and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is n-tetradecanoyl-CoA,NAD(P)H:O2 oxidoreductase [11-(E) desaturating].
