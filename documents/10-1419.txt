   Rifamycin-B oxidase      Rifamycin-B oxidase   In enzymology , a rifamycin-B oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   rifamycin B + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   rifamycin O + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are rifamycin B and O 2 , whereas its two products are rifamycin O and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on diphenols and related substances as donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is rifamycin-B:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called rifamycin B oxidase .
