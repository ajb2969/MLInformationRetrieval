   Fermi–Walker transport      Fermi–Walker transport   Fermi–Walker transport is a process in general relativity used to define a coordinate system or reference frame such that all curvature in the frame is due to the presence of mass/energy density and not to arbitrary spin or rotation of the frame.  Fermi–Walker differentiation  In the theory of Lorentzian manifolds, Fermi–Walker differentiation is a generalization of covariant differentiation. In general relativity, Fermi–Walker derivatives of the spacelike unit vector fields in a frame field, taken with respect to the timelike unit vector field in the frame field, are used to define non-inertial but nonspinning frames, by stipulating that the Fermi–Walker derivatives should vanish. In the special case of inertial frames, the Fermi–Walker derivatives reduce to covariant derivatives.  This is defined for a vector field X along a curve    γ   (  s  )       γ  s    \gamma(s)   :          D  F   X    d  s    =      D  X    d  s    -    (  X  ,    D  V    d  s    )   V    +    (  X  ,  V  )     D  V    d  s       ,           subscript  D  F   X     d  s            D  X     d  s       X      D  V     d  s     V       X  V       D  V     d  s        \frac{D_{F}X}{ds}=\frac{DX}{ds}-(X,\frac{DV}{ds})V+(X,V)\frac{DV}{ds},     where V is four-velocity, D is the covariant derivative in the Riemannian space , and (,) is scalar product. If          D  F   X    d  s    =  0   ,           subscript  D  F   X     d  s    0    \frac{D_{F}X}{ds}=0,   the vector field X is Fermi–Walker transported along the curve (see Hawking and Ellis, p. 80). Vectors perpendicular to the space of four-velocities in Minkowski spacetime , e.g., polarization vectors, under Fermi–Walker transport experience Thomas precession .  Using the Fermi derivative, the Bargmann–Michel–Telegdi equation 1 for spin precession of electron in an external electromagnetic field can be written as follows:          D  F    a  τ     d  s    =   2  μ   (    F   τ  λ    -    u  τ    u  σ    F   σ  λ      )    a  λ     ,           subscript  D  F    superscript  a  τ      d  s      2  μ     superscript  F    τ  λ       superscript  u  τ    subscript  u  σ    superscript  F    σ  λ       subscript  a  λ      \frac{D_{F}a^{\tau}}{ds}=2\mu(F^{\tau\lambda}-u^{\tau}u_{\sigma}F^{\sigma%
 \lambda})a_{\lambda},   where    a  τ     superscript  a  τ    a^{\tau}   and   μ   μ   \mu   are polarization four-vector and magnetic moment,    u  τ     superscript  u  τ    u^{\tau}   is four-velocity of electron,      a  τ    a  τ    =   -    u  τ    u  τ     =   -  1            superscript  a  τ    subscript  a  τ         superscript  u  τ    subscript  u  τ            1      a^{\tau}a_{\tau}=-u^{\tau}u_{\tau}=-1   ,      u  τ    a  τ    =  0         superscript  u  τ    subscript  a  τ    0    u^{\tau}a_{\tau}=0   , and    F   τ  σ      superscript  F    τ  σ     F^{\tau\sigma}   is electromagnetic field-strength tensor. The right side describes Larmor precession .  Co-moving coordinate systems  A coordinate system co-moving with the particle can be defined. If we take the unit vector    v  μ     superscript  v  μ    v^{\mu}   as defining an axis in the co-moving coordinate system, then any system transforming with proper time is said to be undergoing Fermi Walker transport. 2  See also   Basic introduction to the mathematics of curved spacetime  Enrico Fermi  Transition from Newtonian mechanics to general relativity   References  Textbooks     "  Category:Mathematical methods in general relativity     V.
