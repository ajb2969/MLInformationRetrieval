   Short-circuit test      Short-circuit test   The purpose of a short-circuit test is to determine the series branch parameters of the equivalent circuit of a real transformer .  (Figure)  Circuit diagram for short-circuit test   Method  The test is conducted on the high-voltage (HV) side of the transformer where the low-voltage (LV) side or the secondary is short circuited. The supply voltage required to circulate rated current through the transformer is usually very small and is of the order of a few percent of the nominal voltage and this 5% voltage is applied across primary. The core losses are very small because applied voltage is only a few percentage of the nominal voltage and hence can be neglected. Thus the wattmeter reading measures only the full load copper loss.  Procedure  To conduct a short-circuit test on power transformer:   Isolate the power transformer from service.  Remove HV/LV jumps and disconnect neutral from earth/ground.  Short LV phases and connect these short circuited terminals to neutral  Energise HV side by LV supply.  Measure current in neutral, HV voltage and HV line currents.

A different form of short-circuit testing is done to assess the mechanical strength of the transformer windings, and their ability to withstand the high forces produced if an energized transformer experiences a short-circuit fault. Currents during such events can be several times the normal rated current. The resultant forces can distort the windings or break internal connections. For large utility-scale power transformers, high-power test laboratories such as the one operated by KEMA at Arnhem, Holland, and CESI Italy have facilities to apply the very high power levels representative of a fault on an interconnected grid system.
