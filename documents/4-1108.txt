Triacontagon

In geometry, a triacontagon is a thirty-sided polygon. The sum of any triacontagon's interior angles is 5040 degrees.
The regular triacontagon is a constructible polygon, by an edge-bisection of a regular pentadecagon, and can also be constructed as a truncated pentadecagon, t{15}.
Regular triacontagon properties
One interior angle in a regular triacontagon is 168°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 12°. The triacontagon is the largest regular polygon whose interior angle is the sum of the interior angles of smaller polygons: 168° is the sum of the interior angles of the equilateral triangle (60°) and the regular pentagon (108°).
The area of a regular triacontagon is (with )



The inradius of a regular triacontagon is



The circumradius of a regular triacontagon is



Construction
A regular triacontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge.1
Triacontagram
A triacontagram is a 30-sided star polygon. There are 3 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {30/7}, {30/11}, and {30/13}, and 11 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration.

There are also isogonal triacontagrams constructed as deeper truncations of the regular pentadecagon {15} and pentadecagram {15/7}, and inverted pentadecagrams {15/11}, and {15/13}. Other truncations form double coverings: t{15/14}={30/14}=2{15/7}, t{15/8}={30/8}=2{15/4}, t{15/4}={30/4}=2{15/4}, and t{15/2}={30/2}=2{15}.2

Petrie polygons
The regular triacontagon is the Petrie polygon for three 8-dimensional polytopes with E8 symmetry, shown in orthogonal projections in the E8 Coxeter plane. It is also the Petrie polygon for two 4-dimensional polytopes, shown in the H4 Coxeter plane.

The regular triacontagram {30/7} is also the Petrie polygon for the great grand stellated 120-cell and grand 600-cell.
