   Triacontagon      Triacontagon   In geometry , a triacontagon is a thirty-sided polygon . The sum of any triacontagon's interior angles is 5040 degrees.  The regular triacontagon is a constructible polygon , by an edge- bisection of a regular pentadecagon , and can also be constructed as a truncated  pentadecagon , t{15}.  Regular triacontagon properties  One interior angle in a regular triacontagon is 168°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 12°. The triacontagon is the largest regular polygon whose interior angle is the sum of the interior angles of smaller polygons: 168° is the sum of the interior angles of the equilateral triangle (60°) and the regular pentagon (108°).  The area of a regular triacontagon is (with )      A  =   15  2    t  2   cot   π  30   =   15  2    t  2    (    23  +   10   5    +   2    3   (   85  +   38   5     )        =   15  4    t  2    (   15   +  3   3   +   2     25  +   11   5      )       fragments  A     15  2    superscript  t  2      π  30      15  2    superscript  t  2    fragments  normal-(      23    10    5      2      3    85    38    5             15  4    superscript  t  2    fragments  normal-(    15    3    3      2       25    11    5      normal-)      A=\frac{15}{2}t^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{30}=\frac{15}{2}t^{2}(\sqrt{23+10\sqrt{5}+2%
