   Rational reconstruction (mathematics)      Rational reconstruction (mathematics)   In mathematics, rational reconstruction is a method that allows one to recover a rational number from its value modulo an integer. If a problem with a rational solution    r  s      r  s    \frac{r}{s}   is considered modulo a number m , one will obtain the number    n  =    r  ×   s   -  1        (   mod  m   )        n   annotated    r   superscript  s    1      pmod  m      n=r\times s^{-1}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}m)   . If | r |  2 ND using the Euclidean algorithm , as follows. 1  One puts    v  =   (  m  ,  0  )       v   m  0     v=(m,0)   and    w  =   (  n  ,  1  )       w   n  1     w=(n,1)   . One then repeats the following steps until the first component of w becomes     ≤  N      absent  N    \leq N   . Put    q  =   ⌊    v  1    w  1    ⌋       q       subscript  v  1    subscript  w  1       q=\left\lfloor{\frac{v_{1}}{w_{1}}}\right\rfloor   , put z = v − qw . The new v and w are then obtained by putting v = w and w = z .  Then with w such that     w  1   ≤  N       subscript  w  1   N    w_{1}\leq N   , one makes the second component positive by putting w = − w if     w  2   <  0       subscript  w  2   0    w_{2}<0   . If    r  s      r  s    \frac{r}{s}   , then the fraction    r  =   w  1       r   subscript  w  1     r=w_{1}   exists and    s  =   w  2       s   subscript  w  2     s=w_{2}   and $s = w_{2}$ , else no such fraction exists.
