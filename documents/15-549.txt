Rational reconstruction (mathematics)

In mathematics, rational reconstruction is a method that allows one to recover a rational number from its value modulo an integer. If a problem with a rational solution 
 
 
 
  is considered modulo a number m, one will obtain the number 
 
 
 
 . If |r|  2ND using the Euclidean algorithm, as follows. 1
One puts 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . One then repeats the following steps until the first component of w becomes 
 
 
 
 . Put 
 
 
 
 , put z = v − qw. The new v and w are then obtained by putting v = w and w = z.
Then with w such that 
 
 
 
 , one makes the second component positive by putting w = −w if 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 
 , then the fraction 
 
 
 
  exists and 
 
 
 
  and $s = w_{2}$, else no such fraction exists.
