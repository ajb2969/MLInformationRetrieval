   Shimizu L-function      Shimizu L-function   In mathematics , the Shimizu L-function , introduced by , is a Dirichlet series associated to a totally real  algebraic number field .  defined the signature defect of the boundary of a manifold as the eta invariant , the value as s =0 of their eta function, and used this to show that Hirzebruch's signature defect of a cusp of a Hilbert modular surface can be expressed in terms of the value at s =0 or 1 of a Shimizu L-function.  Definition  Suppose that K is a totally real algebraic number field, M is a lattice in the field, and V is a subgroup of maximal rank of the group of totally positive units preserving the lattice. The Shimazu L-series is given by       L   (  M  ,  V  ,  s  )    =    ∑   μ  ∈    {   M  -  0   }   /  V        sign  N    (  μ  )      |   N   (  μ  )    |   s           L   M  V  s      subscript     μ       M  0    V          sign  N   μ    superscript      N  μ    s       L(M,V,s)=\sum_{\mu\in\{M-0\}/V}\frac{\operatorname{sign}N(\mu)}{|N(\mu)|^{s}}     References       "  Category:Zeta and L-functions
