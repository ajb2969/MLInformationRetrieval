   Bondareva–Shapley theorem      Bondareva–Shapley theorem   The Bondareva–Shapley theorem , in game theory , describes a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the core of a cooperative game . Specifically, the game's core is non-empty if and only if the game is balanced . The Bondareva–Shapley theorem implies that market games and convex games have non-empty cores. The theorem was formulated independently by Olga Bondareva and Lloyd Shapley in the 1960s.  Theorem  Let the pair    ⟨  N  ,  v  ⟩     N  v    \;\langle N,v\rangle\;   be a cooperative game , where    N    N   \;\;N\;   is the set of players and where the value function      v   :    2  N   →   ℝ       normal-:  v   normal-→   superscript  2  N   ℝ     \;v:2^{N}\to\mathbb{R}\;   is defined on   N   N   N   's power set (the set of all subsets of   N   N   N   ). The core of    ⟨  N  ,  v  ⟩     N  v    \;\langle N,v\rangle\;   is non-empty if and only if for every function    α  :     2  N   ∖   {  ∅  }    →   [  0  ,  1  ]       normal-:  α   normal-→     superscript  2  N        0  1      \alpha:2^{N}\setminus\{\emptyset\}\to[0,1]   where       ∀  i   ∈  N   :     ∑    S  ∈   2  N    :   i  ∈  S      α   (  S  )     =  1      normal-:     for-all  i   N       subscript    normal-:    S   superscript  2  N      i  S       α  S    1     \forall i\in N:\sum_{S\in 2^{N}:\;i\in S}\alpha(S)=1    the following condition holds:         ∑   S  ∈    2  N   ∖   {  ∅  }       α   (  S  )   v   (  S  )     ≤   v   (  N  )     .        subscript     S     superscript  2  N           α  S  v  S      v  N     \sum_{S\in 2^{N}\setminus\{\emptyset\}}\alpha(S)v(S)\leq v(N).
