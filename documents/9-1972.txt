Bondareva–Shapley theorem

The Bondareva–Shapley theorem, in game theory, describes a necessary and sufficient condition for the non-emptiness of the core of a cooperative game. Specifically, the game's core is non-empty if and only if the game is balanced. The Bondareva–Shapley theorem implies that market games and convex games have non-empty cores. The theorem was formulated independently by Olga Bondareva and Lloyd Shapley in the 1960s.
Theorem
Let the pair 
 
 
 
  be a cooperative game, where 
 
 
 
  is the set of players and where the value function

 
  is defined on 
 
 
 
 's power set (the set of all subsets of 
 
 
 
 ).
 The core of 
 
 
 
  is non-empty if and only if for every function 
 
 
 
  where


 the following condition holds:
