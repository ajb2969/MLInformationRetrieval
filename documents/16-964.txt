Equivariant bundle

In differential geometry, given a compact Lie group G, an equivariant bundle is a fiber bundle such that the total space and the base spaces are both G-spaces and the projection map 
 
 
 
  between them is equivariant
 
 
 
  with some extra requirement depending on a typical fiber.
For example, an equivariant vector bundle is an equivariant bundle.
