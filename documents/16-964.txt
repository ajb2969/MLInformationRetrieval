   Equivariant bundle      Equivariant bundle   In differential geometry , given a compact Lie group  G , an equivariant bundle is a fiber bundle such that the total space and the base spaces are both G -spaces and the projection map   π   π   \pi   between them is equivariant     π  ∘  g   =   g  ∘  π         π  g     g  π     \pi\circ g=g\circ\pi   with some extra requirement depending on a typical fiber.  For example, an equivariant vector bundle is an equivariant bundle.
