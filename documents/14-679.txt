Spt function

The spt function (smallest parts function) is a function in number theory that counts the sum of the number of smallest parts in each partition of a positive integer. It is related to the partition function.
The first few values of spt(n) are:

1, 3, 5, 10, 14, 26, 35, 57, 80, 119, 161, 238, 315, 440, 589 ... 
 

Example
For example, there are five partitions of 4 (with smallest parts underlined):



3 + 
 

+ 

2 +  + 
 

+  +  + 


These partitions have 1, 1, 2, 2, and 4 smallest parts, respectively. So spt(4) = 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 4 = 10.
Properties
Like the partition function, spt(n) has a generating function. It is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
 .
The function 
 
 
 
  is related to a mock modular form. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the weight 2 quasi-modular Eisenstein series and let 
 
 
 
  denote the Dedekind eta function. Then for 
 
 
 
 , the function


 
  is a mock modular form of weight 3/2 on the full modular group


 
  with multiplier system 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the multiplier system for 
 
 
 
 .
While a closed formula is not known for spt(n), there are Ramanujan-like congruences including
