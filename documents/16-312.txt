   Spherinder      Spherinder   In four-dimensional geometry , the spherinder , or spherical cylinder or spherical prism , is a geometric object, defined as the Cartesian product of a 3- ball (or solid 2- sphere ), radius r 1 and a line segment of radius r 2 :      D  =   {   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ,  w  )   |      x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    ≤   r  1  2    ,    w  2   ≤   r  2  2     }       D   conditional-set   x  y  z  w    formulae-sequence       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2     superscript   subscript  r  1   2       superscript  w  2    superscript   subscript  r  2   2        D=\{(x,y,z,w)|x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}\leq r_{1}^{2},\ w^{2}\leq r_{2}^{2}\}     Like the duocylinder , it is also analogous to a cylinder in 3-space, which is the Cartesian product of a disk with a line segment .  It can be seen in 3-dimensional space by stereographic projection as two concentric spheres, in a similar way that a tesseract (cubic prism) can be projected as two concentric cubes.  Relation to other shapes  In 3-space, a cylinder can be considered intermediate between a cube and a sphere . In 4-space there are three intermediate forms between the tesseract (1- ball × 1-ball × 1-ball × 1-ball) and the hypersphere (4- ball ). They are the:   cubinder (2-ball × 1-ball × 1-ball), whose surface consists of four cylindrical cells and one square torus.  spherinder (3-ball × 1-ball), whose surface consists of three cells - two spheres, and the region in between.  duocylinder (2-ball × 2-ball), whose surface consists of two toroidal cells.   These constructions correspond to the five partitions of 4, the number of dimensions.  Related 4-polytopes  It is related to the uniform prismatic polychora , which are cartesian product of a regular or semiregular polyhedron and a line segment . For example: tetrahedral prism , truncated tetrahedral prism , cubic prism , cuboctahedral prism , octahedral prism , rhombicuboctahedral prism , truncated cubic prism , truncated octahedral prism , truncated cuboctahedral prism , snub cubic prism , dodecahedral prism , icosidodecahedral prism , icosahedral prism , truncated dodecahedral prism , rhombicosidodecahedral prism , truncated icosahedral prism , truncated icosidodecahedral prism , and the snub dodecahedral prism .
