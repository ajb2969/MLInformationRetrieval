   Totally disconnected group      Totally disconnected group   In mathematics , a totally disconnected group is a topological group that is totally disconnected . Such topological groups are necessarily Hausdorff .  Interest centres on locally compact totally disconnected groups (variously referred to as groups of td-type , 1  locally profinite groups , 2  t.d. groups 3 ). The compact case has been heavily studied – these are the profinite groups – but for a long time not much was known about the general case. A theorem of van Dantzig from the 1930s, stating that every such group contains a compact open  subgroup , was all that was known. Then groundbreaking work on this subject was done in 1994, when George Willis showed that every locally compact totally disconnected group contains a so-called tidy subgroup and a special function on its automorphisms, the scale function , thereby advancing the knowledge of the local structure. Advances on the global structure of totally disconnected groups have been obtained in 2011 by Caprace and Monod, with notably a clasification of characteristically simple groups and of Noetherian groups.  Locally compact case  In a locally compact, totally disconnected group, every neighbourhood of the identity contains a compact open subgroup. Conversely, if a group is such that the identity has a neighbourhood basis consisting of compact open subgroups, then it is locally compact and totally disconnected. 4  Tidy subgroups  Let G be a locally compact, totally disconnected group, U a compact open subgroup of G and   α   α   \alpha   a continuous automorphism of G .  Define:       U  +   =    ⋂   n  ≥  0      α  n    (  U  )          subscript  U      subscript     n  0       superscript  α  n   U      U_{+}=\bigcap_{n\geq 0}\alpha^{n}(U)          U  -   =    ⋂   n  ≥  0      α   -  n     (  U  )          subscript  U      subscript     n  0       superscript  α    n    U      U_{-}=\bigcap_{n\geq 0}\alpha^{-n}(U)          U    +  +    =    ⋃   n  ≥  0      α  n    (   U  +   )          subscript  U    absent       subscript     n  0       superscript  α  n    subscript  U        U_{++}=\bigcup_{n\geq 0}\alpha^{n}(U_{+})          U    -  -    =    ⋃   n  ≥  0      α   -  n     (   U  -   )          subscript  U    absent       subscript     n  0       superscript  α    n     subscript  U        U_{--}=\bigcup_{n\geq 0}\alpha^{-n}(U_{-})     U is said to be tidy for   α   α   \alpha   if and only if    U  =    U  +    U  -    =    U  -    U  +          U     subscript  U     subscript  U             subscript  U     subscript  U        U=U_{+}U_{-}=U_{-}U_{+}   and    U    +  +      subscript  U    absent      U_{++}   and    U    -  -      subscript  U    absent      U_{--}   are closed.  The scale function  The index of    α   (   U  +   )       α   subscript  U      \alpha(U_{+})   in    U  +     subscript  U     U_{+}   is shown to be finite and independent of the U which is tidy for   α   α   \alpha   . Define the scale function    s   (  α  )       s  α    s(\alpha)   as this index. Restriction to inner automorphisms gives a function on G with interesting properties. These are in particular: Define the function   s   s   s   on G by     s   (  x  )    :=   s   (   α  x   )       assign    s  x     s   subscript  α  x      s(x):=s(\alpha_{x})   , where    α  x     subscript  α  x    \alpha_{x}   is the inner automorphism of   x   x   x   on G .     s   s   s   is continuous.      s   (  x  )    =  1        s  x   1    s(x)=1   , whenever x in G is a compact element.      s   (   x  n   )    =   s    (  x  )   n          s   superscript  x  n      s   superscript  x  n      s(x^{n})=s(x)^{n}   for every integer   n   n   n   . The modular function on G is given by     Δ   (  x  )    =   s   (  x  )   s    (   x   -  1    )    -  1           normal-Δ  x     s  x  s   superscript   superscript  x    1      1       \Delta(x)=s(x)s(x^{-1})^{-1}   .   Calculations and applications  The scale function was used to prove a conjecture by Hofmann and Mukherja and has been explicitly calculated for p-adic  Lie groups and linear groups over local skew fields by Helge Glöckner.
