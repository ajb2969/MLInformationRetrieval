Trigenus

In low-dimensional topology, the trigenus of a closed 3-manifold is an invariant consisting of an ordered triple 
 
 
 
 . It is obtained by minimizing the genera of three orientable handle bodies — with no intersection between their interiors— which decompose the manifold as far as the Heegaard genus need only two.
That is, a decomposition 
 
 
 
  with

For orientable spaces,

It has been proved that the number 
 
 
 
 
  has a relation with the concept of Stiefel–Whitney surface, that is, an orientable surface 
 
 
 
  which is embedded in

Theorem
A manifold S is a Stiefel–Whitney surface in M, if and only if S and M−int(N(S)) are orientable '''.
