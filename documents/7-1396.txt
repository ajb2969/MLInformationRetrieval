Doob martingale

A Doob martingale (also known as a Levy martingale) is a mathematical construction of a stochastic process which approximates a given random variable and has the martingale property with respect to the given filtration. It may be thought of as the evolving sequence of best approximations to the random variable based on information accumulated up to a certain time.
When analyzing sums, random walks, or other additive functions of independent random variables, one can often apply the central limit theorem, law of large numbers, Chernoff's inequality, Chebyshev's inequality or similar tools. When analyzing similar objects where the differences are not independent, the main tools are martingales and Azuma's inequality.
Definition
A Doob martingale (named after Joseph L. Doob)1 is a generic construction that is always a martingale. Specifically, consider any set of random variables



taking values in a set 
 
 
 
  for which we are interested in the function 
 
 
 
  and define:



where the above expectation is itself a random quantity since the expectation is only taken over



and



are treated as random variables. It is possible to show that 
 
 
 
  is always a martingale regardless of the properties of 
 
 
 
 .
The sequence 
 
 
 
  is the Doob martigale for f.2
Application
Thus if one can bound the differences


 
 ,
one can apply Azuma's inequality and show that with high probability 
 
 
 
  is concentrated around its expected value



McDiarmid's inequality
One common way of bounding the differences and applying Azuma's inequality to a Doob martingale is called McDiarmid's inequality.3
Suppose 
 
 
 
  are independent and assume that 
 
 
 
  satisfies



(In other words, replacing the 
 
 
 
 
 -th coordinate 
 
 
 
  by some other value changes the value of 
 
 
 
  by at most 
 
 
 
 .)
It follows that



and therefore Azuma's inequality yields the following McDiarmid inequalities for any 
 
 
 
 
 :



and
