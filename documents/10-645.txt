   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 6-dehydrogenase      2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 6-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 6-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (4S,5S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,6-dioxohexanoate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are (4S,5S)-4,5-dihydroxy-2,6-dioxohexanoate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate:NADP + 6-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconate dehydrogenase, and 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate dehydrogenase.
