   Putnam–Norden–Rayleigh curve      Putnam–Norden–Rayleigh curve   In the study of software project scheduling , the Putnam–Norden–Rayleigh curve , also known as the PNR curve , is an equation specifying the relationship between applied effort and delivery time for a software project. A PNR curve can be used to determine the least cost time for delivery    t  o     subscript  t  o    t_{o}   up to the limit    t   m  i  n      subscript  t    m  i  n     t_{min}   , the absolute minimal amount of time required to complete the project no matter how many human resources are added. The PNR curve was used to derive the Software equation . 1  Equation  The following equation shows the relationship of project effort as a function of project delivery time.       E  a   =   m   (    t  d    4    t  a    4    )         subscript  E  a     m     superscript   subscript  t  d   4    superscript   subscript  t  a   4       E_{a}=m\left(\frac{{t_{d}}^{4}}{{t_{a}}^{4}}\right)     Where       E  a     subscript  E  a    E_{a}   =Effort in person months      t  d     subscript  t  d    t_{d}   =The nominal delivery time for the schedule      t  a     subscript  t  a    t_{a}   =Actual delivery time desired   See also   Software equation '''effort=a1*(kloc) d1'' '  Putnam_model  'Putnam Rayleigh Model  '   References  "  Category:Software engineering costs     ↩
