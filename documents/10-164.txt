Putnam–Norden–Rayleigh curve

In the study of software project scheduling, the Putnam–Norden–Rayleigh curve, also known as the PNR curve, is an equation specifying the relationship between applied effort and delivery time for a software project. A PNR curve can be used to determine the least cost time for delivery 
 
 
 
  up to the limit 
 
 
 
 , the absolute minimal amount of time required to complete the project no matter how many human resources are added. The PNR curve was used to derive the Software equation.1
Equation
The following equation shows the relationship of project effort as a function of project delivery time.



Where



 
 =Effort in person months


 
 =The nominal delivery time for the schedule


 
 =Actual delivery time desired
