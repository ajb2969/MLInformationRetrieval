   Heun function      Heun function   In mathematics , the local Heun function H⁢ℓ(a,q;α,β,γ,δ;z)  is the solution of Heun's differential equation that is holomorphic and 1 at the singular point z = 0. The local Heun function is called a Heun function , denoted Hf , if it is also regular at z = 1, and is called a Heun polynomial , denoted Hp , if it is regular at all three finite singular points z = 0, 1, a .  Heun's equation  Heun's equation is a second-order linear  ordinary differential equation (ODE) of the form          d  2   w    d   z  2     +    [    γ  z   +   δ   z  -  1    +   ϵ   z  -  a     ]     d  w    d  z     +      α  β  z   -  q    z   (   z  -  1   )    (   z  -  a   )     w    =  0.             superscript  d  2   w     d   superscript  z  2        delimited-[]      γ  z     δ    z  1      ϵ    z  a          d  w     d  z             α  β  z   q     z    z  1     z  a     w    0.    \frac{d^{2}w}{dz^{2}}+\left[\frac{\gamma}{z}+\frac{\delta}{z-1}+\frac{\epsilon%
 }{z-a}\right]\frac{dw}{dz}+\frac{\alpha\beta z-q}{z(z-1)(z-a)}w=0.     The condition    ϵ  =     α  +  β   -  γ  -  δ   +  1       ϵ        α  β   γ  δ   1     \epsilon=\alpha+\beta-\gamma-\delta+1   is needed to ensure regularity of the point at ∞.  The complex number q is called the accessory parameter . Heun's equation has four regular singular points : 0, 1, a and ∞ with exponents (0, 1 − γ), (0, 1 − δ), (0, 1 − ϵ), and (α, β). Every second-order linear ODE on the extended complex plane with at most four regular singular points, such as the Lamé equation or the hypergeometric differential equation , can be transformed into this equation by a change of variable.  Symmetries  Heun's equation has a group of symmetries of order 192, isomorphic to the Coxeter group of the Coxeter diagram  D 4 , analogous to the 24 symmetries of the hypergeometric differential equations obtained by Kummer. The symmetries fixing the local Heun function form a group of order 24 isomorphic to the symmetric group on 4 points, so there are 192/24 = 8 = 2 × 4 essentially different solutions given by acting on the local Heun function by these symmetries, which give solutions for each of the 2 exponents for each of the 4 singular points. The complete list of 192 symmetries was given by  using machine calculation. Several previous attempts by various authors to list these by hand contained many errors and omissions; for example, most of the 48 local solutions listed by Heun contain serious errors.
