Real gas

Real gases – as opposed to a perfect or ideal gas – exhibit properties that cannot be explained entirely using the ideal gas law. To understand the behaviour of real gases, the following must be taken into account:

compressibility effects;
variable specific heat capacity;
van der Waals forces;
non-equilibrium thermodynamic effects;
issues with molecular dissociation and elementary reactions with variable composition.

For most applications, such a detailed analysis is unnecessary, and the ideal gas approximation can be used with reasonable accuracy. On the other hand, real-gas models have to be used near the condensation point of gases, near critical points, at very high pressures, to explain the Joule–Thomson effect and in other less usual cases.

van der Waals model
Real gases are often modeled by taking into account their molar weight and molar volume



Where P is the pressure, T is the temperature, R the ideal gas constant, and Vm the molar volume. a and b are parameters that are determined empirically for each gas, but are sometimes estimated from their critical temperature (Tc) and critical pressure (Pc) using these relations:






Redlich–Kwong model
The Redlich–Kwong equation is another two-parameter equation that is used to model real gases. It is almost always more accurate than the van der Waals equation, and often more accurate than some equations with more than two parameters. The equation is



where a and b two empirical parameters that are not the same parameters as in the van der Waals equation. These parameters can be determined:




Berthelot and modified Berthelot model
The Berthelot equation (named after D. Berthelot1 is very rarely used,



but the modified version is somewhat more accurate



Dieterici model
This model (named after C. Dieterici2) fell out of usage in recent years


 
 .
Clausius model
The Clausius equation (named after Rudolf Clausius) is a very simple three-parameter equation used to model gases.



where





where Vc is critical volume.
Virial model
The Virial equation derives from a perturbative treatment of statistical mechanics.



or alternatively



where A, B, C, A′, B′, and C′ are temperature dependent constants.
Peng–Robinson model
Peng–Robinson equation of state (named after D.-Y. Peng and D. B. Robinson3) has the interesting property being useful in modeling some liquids as well as real gases.



Wohl model
The Wohl equation (named after A. Wohl4) is formulated in terms of critical values, making it useful when real gas constants are not available.



where




 
 .
Beattie–Bridgeman model
5
This equation is based on five experimentally determined constants. It is expressed as



where





 
  This equation is known to be reasonably accurate for densities up to about 0.8 ρcr, where ρcr is the density of the substance at its critical point. The constants appearing in the above equation are available in following table when P is in KPa, v is in

where d is the molar density and where a, b, c, A, B, C, α, and γ are empirical constants. Note that the γ constant is a derivative of constant α and therefore almost identical to 1.
