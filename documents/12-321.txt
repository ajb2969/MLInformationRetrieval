Size functor

Given a size pair

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a manifold of dimension 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary real continuous function defined on it, the 
 
 
 
 -th '' size functor'',1 with 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is the functor in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the category of ordered real numbers, and 
 
 
 
  is the category of Abelian groups, defined in the following way. For 
 
 
 
 , setting 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  equal to the inclusion from 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  equal to the morphism in 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 ,

for each

In other words, the size functor studies the process of the birth and death of homology classes as the lower level set changes. When 
 
 
 
  is smooth and compact and 
 
 
 
  is a Morse function, the functor 
 
 
 
  can be described by oriented trees, called 
 
 
 
  − trees.
The concept of size functor was introduced as an extension to homology theory and category theory of the idea of size function. The main motivation for introducing the size functor originated by the observation that the size function

 
  can be seen as the rank of the image of 
 
 
 
 .
The concept of size functor is strictly related to the concept of persistent homology group ,2 studied in persistent homology. It is worth to point out that the 
 
 
 
 -th persistent homology group coincides with the image of the homomorphism
