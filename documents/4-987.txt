Strong generating set

In abstract algebra, especially in the area of group theory, a strong generating set of a permutation group is a generating set that clearly exhibits the permutation structure as described by a stabilizer chain. A stabilizer chain is a sequence of subgroups, each containing the next and each stabilizing one more point.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a group of permutations of the set 
 
 
 
  Let



be a sequence of distinct integers, 
 
 
 
  such that the pointwise stabilizer of

  be a base for

  is a set

The base and the SGS are said to be non-redundant if

A base and strong generating set (BSGS) for a group can be computed using the Schreierâ€“Sims algorithm.
