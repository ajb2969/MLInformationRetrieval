Distribution learning theory

The distributional learning theory or learning of probability distribution is a framework in computational learning theory. It has been proposed from Michael Kearns, Yishay Mansour, Dana Ron, Ronitt Rubinfeld, Robert Schapire and Linda Sellie in 1994 1 and it was inspired from the PAC-framework introduced by Leslie Valiant.2
In this framework the input is a number of samples drawn from a distribution that belongs to a specific class of distributions. The goal is to find an efficient algorithm that, based on these samples, determines with high probability the distribution from which the samples have been drawn. Because of its generality this framework it has been used in a large variety of different fields like machine learning, approximation algorithms, applied probability and statistics.
This article explains the basic definitions, tools and results in this framework from the theory of computation point of view.
Basic Definitions
Let 
 
 
 
  be the support of the distributions that we are interested in. As in the original work of Kearns et. al.3 if 
 
 
 
  is finite it can be assumed without loss of generality that 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the number of bits that have to be used in order to represent any 
 
 
 
 . We focus in probability distributions over 
 
 
 
 .
There are two possible representations of a probability distribution 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 .

probability distribution function (or evaluator) an evaluator 
 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  takes as input any 
 
 
 
  and outputs a real number 
 
 
 
  which denotes the probability that of 
 
 
 
  according to 
 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 .


generator a generator 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  takes as input a string of truly random bits 
 
 
 
 
  and outputs 
 
 
 
  according to the distribution 
 
 
 
 . Generator can be interpreted as a routine that simulates sampling from the distribution 
 
 
 
  given a sequence of fair coin tosses.

A distribution 
 
 
 
  is called to have a polynomial generator (respectively evaluator) if its generator (respectively evaluator) exists and can be computed in polynomial time.
Let 
 
 
 
 
  a class of distribution over X, that is 
 
 
 
  is a set such that every 
 
 
 
  is a probability distribution with support 
 
 
 
 . The 
 
 
 
  can also be written as 
 
 
 
 
  for simplicity.
Before defining learnability its necessary to define good approximations of a distribution 
 
 
 
 . There are three ways to measure the distance between two distribution. The three more common possibilities are

Kullback-Leibler divergence


Total variation distance


Kolmogorov distance

The strongest of these distances is the Kullback-Leibler divergence and the weakest is the Kolmogorov distance. This means that for any pair of distributions 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  :



Therefore for example if 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are close with respect to Kullback-Leibler divergence then they are also close with respect to all the other distances.
Next definitions hold for all the distances and therefore the symbol 
 
 
 
  denotes the distance between the distribution 
 
 
 
  and the distribution 
 
 
 
  using one of the distances that we describe above. Although learnability of a class of distributions can be defined using any of these distances, applications refer to a specific distance.
The basic input that we use in order to learn a distribution is an number of samples drawn by this distribution. For the computational point of view the assumption is that such a sample is given in a constant amount of time. So it's like having access to an oracle 
 
 
 
 
  that returns a sample from the distribution 
 
 
 
 . Sometimes the interest is, apart from measuring the time complexity, to measure the number of samples that have to be used in order to learn a specific distribution 
 
 
 
  in class of distributions 
 
 
 
 . This quantity is called sample complexity of the learning algorithm.
In order for the problem of distribution learning to be more clear consider the problem of supervised learning as defined in.4 In this framework of statistical learning theory a training set 
 
 
 
  and the goal is to find a target function 
 
 
 
 
  that minimizes some loss function, e.g. the square loss function. More formally 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the loss function, e.g. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the probability distribution according to which the elements of the training set are sampled. If the conditional probability distribution

 
 
  is known then the target function has the closed form 
 
 
 
 . So the set 
 
 
 
  is a set of samples from the probability distribution

 
 . Now the goal of distributional learning theory if to find 
 
 
 
  given 
 
 
 
 
  which can be used to find the target function 
 
 
 
 .
Definition of learnability
A class of distributions 
 
 
 
  is called efficiently learnable if for every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  given access to 
 
 
 
 
  for an unknown distribution 
 
 
 
 , there exists a polynomial time algorithm 
 
 
 
 , called learning algorithm of 
 
 
 
 , that outputs an generator or an evaluator of a distribution 
 
 
 
  such that



If we know that 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is called proper learning algorithm, otherwise is called improper learning algorithm.
In some settings the class of distributions 
 
 
 
  is a class with well known distributions which can be described by set a set of parameters. For instance 
 
 
 
  could be the class of all the Gaussian distributions 
 
 
 
 
 . In this case the algorithm 
 
 
 
  should be able to estimate the parameters 
 
 
 
 . In this case 
 
 
 
  is called parameter learning algorithm.
Obviously the parameter learning for simple distributions is a very well studied field that is called statistical estimation and there is a very long bibliography on different estimators for different kinds of simple known distributions. But distributions learning theory deals with learning class of distributions that have more complicated description.
First results 5
In their seminal work, Kearns et. al.6 deal with the case where 
 
 
 
  is described in term of a finite polynomial sized circuit and they proved the following for some specific classes of distribution



 
 
  gate distributions for this kind of distributions there is no polynomial-sized evaluator, unless 
 
 
 
 . On the other hand this class is efficiently learnable with generator.


Parity gate distributions this class is efficiently learnable with both generator and evaluator.


Mixtures of Hamming Balls this class is efficiently learnable with both generator and evaluator.


Probabilistic Finite Automata this class is not efficiently learnable with evaluator under the Noisy Parity Assumption which is an impossibility assumption in the PAC learning framework.



 
 Covers
One very common technique in order to find a learning algorithm for a class of distributions 
 
 
 
  is to first find a small 
 
 
 
 cover of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Definition
A set 
 
 
 
  is called 
 
 
 
 -cover of 
 
 
 
  if for every 
 
 
 
  there is a 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . An 
 
 
 
  cover is small if it has polynomial size with respect to the parameters that describe 
 
 
 
 .
Once there is an efficient procedure that for every 
 
 
 
  finds a small 
 
 
 
 
 cover 
 
 
 
  of C then the only left task is to select from 
 
 
 
  the distribution 
 
 
 
  that is closer to the distribution 
 
 
 
  that has to be learned.
The problem is that given 
 
 
 
 
  it is not trivial how we can compare 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in order to decide which one is the closest to 
 
 
 
 , because 
 
 
 
  is unknown. Therefore the samples from 
 
 
 
 
  have to be used to do these comparisons. Obviously the result of the comparison always has a probability of error. So the task is similar with finding the minimum in a set of element using noisy comparisons. There are a lot of classical algorithms in order to achieve this goal. The most recent one which achieves the best guarantees was proposed by Daskalakis and Kamath 7 This algorithm sets up a fast tournament between the elements of 
 
 
 
  where the winner 
 
 
 
  of this tournament is the element which is 
 
 
 
 close to 
 
 
 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
 
 ) with probability at least 
 
 
 
 . In order to do so their algorithm uses 
 
 
 
  samples from 
 
 
 
  and runs in 
 
 
 
  time, where 
 
 
 
 
 .
Learning Sums of Random Variables
Learning of simple well known distribution is an well studied field and there are a lot of estimators that can be used. One more complicated class of distributions is the distributions of sum of variables that follow simple distributions. These learning procedure have a close relation with limit theorems like the central limit theorem because they tent to examine the same object when the sum tends to an infinite sum. Recently there are two interesting results that we will describe here the : learning Poisson binomial distributions and learning sums of independent integer random variables. All the results below hold using the total variation distance as a distance measure.
Learning Poisson Binomial Distributions 8
Consider 
 
 
 
  independent Bernoulli random variables 
 
 
 
  with probabilities of success 
 
 
 
 . A Poisson Binomial Distribution of order 
 
 
 
  is the distribution of the sum 
 
 
 
 
 . For learning the class 
 
 
 
 . The first of the following results deals with the case of improper learning of 
 
 
 
  and the second with the proper learning of 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  then there is an algorithm which given 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and access to 
 
 
 
  finds a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 . The sample complexity of this algorithm is 
 
 
 
  and the running time is 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  then there is an algorithm which given 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and access to 
 
 
 
  finds a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . The sample complexity of this algorithm is 
 
 
 
 
  and the running time is 
 
 
 
 .
One very interesting part of the above results is that the sample complexity of the learning algorithm doesn't depend on 
 
 
 
 , although the description of 
 
 
 
  is linear in 
 
 
 
 . Also the second result is almost optimal with respect to the sample complexity because there is also a lower bound of 
 
 
 
 
 .
The proof uses a small 
 
 
 
 cover of 
 
 
 
  that has been produced by Daskalakis and Papadimitriou,9 in order to get this algorithm.
Learning Sums of Independent Integer Random Variables 10
Consider 
 
 
 
  independent random variables 
 
 
 
  each of which follows an arbitrary distribution with support 
 
 
 
 
 . A 
 
 
 
 sum of independent integer random variable of order 
 
 
 
  is the distribution of the sum 
 
 
 
 . For learning the class



there is the following result
Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
 
  then there is an algorithm which given 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and access to 
 
 
 
  finds a 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 . The sample complexity of this algorithm is 
 
 
 
  and the running time is also 
 
 
 
 .
Again one interesting part is that the sample and the time complexity does not depend on 
 
 
 
 . Its possible to conclude this independence for the previous section if we set 
 
 
 
 .
Learning Mixtures of Gaussians 1112
Let the random variables 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Define the random variable 
 
 
 
  which takes the same value as 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
  and the same value as 
 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
 . Then if 
 
 
 
  is the density of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the density of 
 
 
 
 
  the density of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . In this case 
 
 
 
  is said to follow a mixture of Gaussians. Pearson 13 was the first who introduced the notion of the mixtures of Gaussians in his attempt to explain the probability distribution from which he got same data that he wanted to analyze. So after doing a lot of calculations by hand, he finally fitted his data to a mixture of Gaussians. The learning task in this case is to determine the parameters of the mixture 
 
 
 
 .
The first attempt to solve this problem was from Dasgupta.14 In this work Dasgupta assumes that the two means of the Gaussians are far enough from each other. This means that there is a lower bound on the distance 
 
 
 
 
 . Using this assumption Dasgupta and a lot of scientists after him where able to learn the parameters of the mixture. The learning procedure starts with clustering the samples into two different clusters minimizing some metric. Using the assumption that the means of the Gaussians are far away from each other with high probability the samples in the first cluster correspond to samples from the first Gaussian and the samples in the second cluster to samples from the second one. Now that the samples are partitioned the 
 
 
 
  can be computed from simple statistical estimators and 
 
 
 
  by comparing the magnitude of the clusters.
If 
 
 
 
  is the set of all the mixtures of two Gaussians, using the above procedure theorems like the following can be proved.
Theorem 15
Let 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the largest eigenvalue of 
 
 
 
 , then there is an algorithm which given 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and access to 
 
 
 
  finds an approximation 
 
 
 
  of the parameters such that 
 
 
 
  (respectively for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . The sample complexity of this algorithm is 
 
 
 
  and the running time is 
 
 
 
 .
The above result could also be generalized in 
 
 
 
 mixture of Gaussians.16
Interestingly for the case of mixture of two Gaussians there are learning results without the assumption of the distance between their means, like the following one which uses the total variation distance as a distance measure.
Theorem 17
Let 
 
 
 
  then there is an algorithm which given 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and access to 
 
 
 
  finds 
 
 
 
  such that if 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 . The sample complexity and the running time of this algorithm is 
 
 
 
 .
It is very interesting in the above result that the distance between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  doesn't affect the quality of the result of the algorithm but just the sample complexity and the running time.
