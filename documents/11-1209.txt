Anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, an anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-D-glucose + an anthocyanidin 
 
 
 
  UDP + an anthocyanidin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-D-glucose and anthocyanidin, whereas its two products are UDP and anthocyanidin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-anthocyanidin 3-O-glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin/flavonol 3-O-glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose:cyanidin-3-O-glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose:anthocyanidin 3-O-D-glucosyltransferase, and 3-GT. This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis.
