   Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase      Acetoacetyl-CoA reductase   In enzymology , an acetoacetyl-CoA reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-oxoacyl-CoA + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 3-oxoacyl-CoA , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA:NADP + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include acetoacetyl coenzyme A reductase , hydroxyacyl coenzyme-A dehydrogenase , NADP + -linked acetoacetyl CoA reductase , NADPH:acetoacetyl-CoA reductase , D(−)-beta-hydroxybutyryl CoA-NADP + oxidoreductase , short chain beta-ketoacetyl(acetoacetyl)-CoA reductase , beta-ketoacyl-CoA reductase , D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA reductase , and (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism.  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure
