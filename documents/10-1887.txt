Acylpyruvate hydrolase

In enzymology, an acylpyruvate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a 3-acylpyruvate + H2O 
 
 
 
  a carboxylate + pyruvate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-acylpyruvate and water, whereas its two products are carboxylate and pyruvate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carbon-carbon bonds in ketonic substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-acylpyruvate acylhydrolase. This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism.
