Very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase

Very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA synthase (, very-long-chain 3-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, very-long-chain beta-ketoacyl-CoA synthase, condensing enzyme, CUT1 (gene), CER6 (gene), FAE1 (gene), KCS (gene), ELO (gene)) is an enzyme with system name malonyl-CoA:very-long-chain acyl-CoA malonyltransferase (decarboxylating and thioester-hydrolysing).12345678 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

very-long-chain acyl-CoA + malonyl-CoA

 
  very-long-chain 3-oxoacyl-CoA + CO2 + coenzyme A


This is the first component of the elongase, a microsomal protein complex responsible for extending palmitoyl-CoA and stearoyl-CoA to very-long-chain acyl CoAs.
