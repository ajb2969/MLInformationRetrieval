(S)-N-acetyl-1-phenylethylamine hydrolase




(S)-N-acetyl-1-phenylethylamine hydrolase

In enzymology, a (S)-N-acetyl-1-phenylethylamine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetylphenylethylamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  phenylethylamine + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetylphenylethylamine and H2O, whereas its two products are phenylethylamine and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-N-acetylphenylethylamine:H2O hydrolase. At least one compound, Phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride is known to inhibit this enzyme.
