   Serine-sulfate ammonia-lyase      Serine-sulfate ammonia-lyase   In enzymology , a serine-sulfate ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-serine O-sulfate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + NH 3 + sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-serine O-sulfate and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are pyruvate , NH 3 , and sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-serine-O-sulfate ammonia-lyase (pyruvate-forming) . This enzyme is also called (L-SOS)lyase .
