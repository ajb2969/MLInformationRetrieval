   Schur algebra      Schur algebra  In mathematics, '''Schur algebras''', named after [[Issai Schur]], are certain finite-dimensional [[associative algebra|algebras]] closely associated with [[Schur‚ÄìWeyl duality]] between [[general linear group|general linear]] and [[symmetric group|symmetric]] groups. They are used to relate the [[representation theory|representation theories]] of those two [[group (mathematics)|groups]]. Their use was promoted by the influential monograph of [[J. A. Green]] first published in 1980. [[J. A. Green]], ''Polynomial Representations of G L n '', Springer Lecture Notes 830, Springer-Verlag 1980. , ISBN 978-3-540-46944-5, ISBN 3-540-46944-3 The name "Schur algebra" is due to Green. In the modular case (over infinite fields of positive characteristic) Schur algebras were used by Gordon James and Karin Erdmann to show that the (still open) problems of computing decomposition numbers for general linear groups and symmetric groups are actually equivalent. 1 Schur algebras were used by Friedlander and Suslin to prove finite generation of cohomology of finite group schemes . 2  Construction  The Schur algebra     S  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  S  k    n  r     S_{k}(n,r)   can be defined for any commutative ring    k   k   k   and integers     n  ,  r   ‚â•  0       n  r   0    n,r\geq 0   . Consider the algebra     k   [   x   i  j    ]       k   delimited-[]   subscript  x    i  j       k[x_{ij}]   of polynomials (with coefficients in   k   k   k   ) in    n  2     superscript  n  2    n^{2}   commuting variables    x   i  j      subscript  x    i  j     x_{ij}   , 1 ‚â§ i , j ‚â§   n   n   n   . Denote by     A  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  A  k    n  r     A_{k}(n,r)   the homogeneous polynomials of degree   r   r   r   . Elements of     A  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  A  k    n  r     A_{k}(n,r)   are k -linear combinations of monomials formed by multiplying together   r   r   r   of the generators    x   i  j      subscript  x    i  j     x_{ij}   (allowing repetition). Thus        k   [   x   i  j    ]    =    ‚äï   r  ‚â•  0      A  k    (  n  ,  r  )      .        k   delimited-[]   subscript  x    i  j        subscript  direct-sum    r  0       subscript  A  k    n  r       k[x_{ij}]=\bigoplus_{r\geq 0}A_{k}(n,r).     Now,    k   [   x   i  j    ]       k   delimited-[]   subscript  x    i  j       k[x_{ij}]   has a natural coalgebra structure with comultiplication   Œî   normal-Œî   \Delta   and counit   Œµ   Œµ   \varepsilon   the algebra homomorphisms given on generators by         Œî   (   x   i  j    )    =     ‚àë  l      x   i  l    ‚äó   x   l  j       ,    Œµ   (   x   i  j    )    =   Œ¥   i  j         formulae-sequence      normal-Œî   subscript  x    i  j       subscript   l    tensor-product   subscript  x    i  l     subscript  x    l  j           Œµ   subscript  x    i  j      subscript  Œ¥    i  j       \Delta(x_{ij})=\textstyle\sum_{l}x_{il}\otimes x_{lj},\quad\varepsilon(x_{ij})%
 =\delta_{ij}\quad   ( Kronecker's delta ).  Since comultiplication is an algebra homomorphism,    k   [   x   i  j    ]       k   delimited-[]   subscript  x    i  j       k[x_{ij}]   is a bialgebra . One easily checks that     A  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  A  k    n  r     A_{k}(n,r)   is a subcoalgebra of the bialgebra    k   [   x   i  j    ]       k   delimited-[]   subscript  x    i  j       k[x_{ij}]   , for every r ‚â•¬†0.  Definition. The Schur algebra (in degree   r   r   r   ) is the algebra      S  k    (  n  ,  r  )    =    Hom  k    (    A  k    (  n  ,  r  )    ,  k  )           subscript  S  k    n  r       subscript  Hom  k       subscript  A  k    n  r    k      S_{k}(n,r)=\mathrm{Hom}_{k}(A_{k}(n,r),k)   . That is,     S  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  S  k    n  r     S_{k}(n,r)   is the linear dual of     A  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  A  k    n  r     A_{k}(n,r)   .  It is a general fact that the linear dual of a coalgebra   A   A   A   is an algebra in a natural way, where the multiplication in the algebra is induced by dualizing the comultiplication in the coalgebra. To see this, let       Œî   (  a  )    =    ‚àë    a  i   ‚äó   b  i            normal-Œî  a      tensor-product   subscript  a  i    subscript  b  i       \Delta(a)=\textstyle\sum a_{i}\otimes b_{i}   and, given linear functionals   f   f   f   ,   g   g   g   on   A   A   A   , define their product to be the linear functional given by       a  ‚Ü¶    ‚àë   f   (   a  i   )   g   (   b  i   )       .     maps-to  a      f   subscript  a  i   g   subscript  b  i       \textstyle a\mapsto\sum f(a_{i})g(b_{i}).   The identity element for this multiplication of functionals is the counit in   A   A   A   .  Main properties   One of the most basic properties expresses     S  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  S  k    n  r     S_{k}(n,r)   as a centralizer algebra. Let    V  =   k  n       V   superscript  k  n     V=k^{n}   be the space of rank   n   n   n   column vectors over   k   k   k   , and form the tensor power         V    ‚äó  r    =    V  ‚äó  ‚ãØ  ‚äó  V    (   r  factors   )     .       superscript  V   tensor-product  absent  r      tensor-product  V  normal-‚ãØ  V     r  factors      V^{\otimes r}=V\otimes\cdots\otimes V\quad(r\text{ factors}).\,   Then the symmetric group     ùîñ  r     subscript  ùîñ  r    \mathfrak{S}_{r}   on   r   r   r   letters acts naturally on the tensor space by place permutation, and one has an isomorphism         S  k    (  n  ,  r  )    ‚âÖ    End   ùîñ  r     (   V    ‚äó  r    )     .         subscript  S  k    n  r       subscript  End   subscript  ùîñ  r     superscript  V   tensor-product  absent  r       S_{k}(n,r)\cong\mathrm{End}_{\mathfrak{S}_{r}}(V^{\otimes r}).   In other words,     S  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  S  k    n  r     S_{k}(n,r)   may be viewed as the algebra of endomorphisms of tensor space commuting with the action of the symmetric group .        S  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  S  k    n  r     S_{k}(n,r)   is free over   k   k   k   of rank given by the binomial coefficient     (         n  2   +  r   -  1       r      )     binomial       superscript  n  2   r   1   r    {\textstyle\left({{n^{2}+r-1}\atop{r}}\right)}   .    Various bases of     S  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  S  k    n  r     S_{k}(n,r)   are known, many of which are indexed by pairs of semistandard Young tableaux of shape   Œª   Œª   \lambda   , as   Œª   Œª   \lambda   varies over the set of partitions of   r   r   r   into no more than   n   n   n   parts.    In case k is an infinite field,     S  k    (  n  ,  r  )        subscript  S  k    n  r     S_{k}(n,r)   may also be identified with the enveloping algebra (in the sense of H. Weyl) for the action of the general linear group      GL  n    (  k  )        subscript  GL  n   k    \mathrm{GL}_{n}(k)   acting on tensor space (via the diagonal action on tensors, induced from the natural action of     GL  n    (  k  )        subscript  GL  n   k    \mathrm{GL}_{n}(k)   on    V  =   k  n       V   superscript  k  n     V=k^{n}   given by matrix multiplication).    Schur algebras are "defined over the integers". This means that they satisfy the following change of scalars property:         S  k    (  n  ,  r  )    ‚âÖ     S  ‚Ñ§    (  n  ,  r  )     ‚äó  ‚Ñ§   k          subscript  S  k    n  r      subscript  tensor-product  ‚Ñ§      subscript  S  ‚Ñ§    n  r    k     S_{k}(n,r)\cong S_{\mathbb{Z}}(n,r)\otimes_{\mathbb{Z}}k      for any commutative ring   k   k   k   .    Schur algebras provide natural examples of quasihereditary algebras 3 (as defined by Cline, Parshall, and Scott), and thus have nice homological properties. In particular, Schur algebras have finite global dimension .   Generalizations   Generalized Schur algebras (associated to any reductive algebraic group ) were introduced by Donkin in the 1980s. 4 These are also quasihereditary.    Around the same time, Dipper and James 5 introduced the quantized Schur algebras (or q-Schur algebras for short), which are a type of q-deformation of the classical Schur algebras described above, in which the symmetric group is replaced by the corresponding Hecke algebra and the general linear group by an appropriate quantum group .    There are also generalized q-Schur algebras , which are obtained by generalizing the work of Dipper and James in the same way that Donkin generalized the classical Schur algebras. 6    There are further generalizations, such as the affine q-Schur algebras 7 related to affine Kac‚ÄìMoody  Lie algebras and other generalizations, such as the cyclotomic q-Schur algebras 8 related to Ariki-Koike algebras (which are q-deformations of certain complex reflection groups ).   The study of these various classes of generalizations forms an active area of contemporary research.
