   Seifert surface      Seifert surface   (Figure)  A Seifert surface bounded by a set of Borromean rings .   In mathematics , a Seifert surface (named after German  mathematician  Herbert Seifert 1 2 ) is a surface whose boundary is a given knot or link .  Such surfaces can be used to study the properties of the associated knot or link. For example, many knot invariants are most easily calculated using a Seifert surface. Seifert surfaces are also interesting in their own right, and the subject of considerable research.  Specifically, let L be a tame  oriented knot or link in Euclidean 3-space (or in the 3-sphere ). A Seifert surface is a compact , connected , oriented  surface  S embedded in 3-space whose boundary is L such that the orientation on L is just the induced orientation from S , and every connected component of S has non-empty boundary.  Note that any compact, connected, oriented surface with nonempty boundary in Euclidean 3-space is the Seifert surface associated to its boundary link. A single knot or link can have many different inequivalent Seifert surfaces. A Seifert surface must be oriented . It is possible to associate unoriented (and not necessarily orientable) surfaces to knots as well.  Examples  The standard Möbius strip has the unknot for a boundary but is not considered to be a Seifert surface for the unknot because it is not orientable.  The "checkerboard" coloring of the usual minimal crossing projection of the trefoil knot gives a Mobius strip with three half twists. As with the previous example, this is not a Seifert surface as it is not orientable. Applying Seifert's algorithm to this diagram, as expected, does produce a Seifert surface; in this case, it is a punctured torus of genus g=1 , and the Seifert matrix is       V  =   (     1     -  1       0    1     )    .      V    1    1     0  1      V=\begin{pmatrix}1&-1\\
 0&1\end{pmatrix}.     Existence and Seifert matrix  It is a theorem that any link always has an associated Seifert surface. This theorem was first published by Frankl and Pontrjagin in 1930. 3 A different proof was published in 1934 by Herbert Seifert and relies on what is now called the Seifert algorithm . The algorithm produces a Seifert surface   S   S   S   , given a projection of the knot or link in question.  Suppose that link has m components ( m =1 for a knot), the diagram has d crossing points, and resolving the crossings (preserving the orientation of the knot) yields f circles. Then the surface   S   S   S   is constructed from f disjoint disks by attaching d bands. The homology group     H  1    (  S  )        subscript  H  1   S    H_{1}(S)   is free abelian on 2g generators, where   g = (2 + d − f − m )/2   is the genus of   S   S   S   . The intersection form  Q on     H  1    (  S  )        subscript  H  1   S    H_{1}(S)   is skew-symmetric , and there is a basis of 2g cycles   a 1 ,a 2 ,...,a 2g    with   Q=(Q(a i ,a j ))    the direct sum of g copies of      (     0     -  1       1    0     )      0    1     1  0     \begin{pmatrix}0&-1\\
 1&0\end{pmatrix}   .  The 2g    ×     \times    2g integer Seifert matrix   V=(v(i,j)) has       v   (  i  ,  j  )       v   i  j     v(i,j)   the linking number in Euclidean 3-space (or in the 3-sphere ) of a i and the pushoff of a j out of the surface, with      V  -  V      V  V    V-V    *      =  Q      absent  Q    =Q     where V * =(v(j,i)) the transpose matrix. Every integer 2g    ×     \times    2g matrix   V   V   V   with    V  -  V      V  V    V-V    *      =  Q      absent  Q    =Q   arises as the Seifert matrix of a knot with genus g Seifert surface.  The Alexander polynomial is computed from the Seifert matrix by    A   (  t  )   =  d  e  t   (  V  -  t  V      fragments  A   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    d  e  t   fragments  normal-(  V   t  V     A(t)=det(V-tV    * ), which is a polynomial in the indeterminate   t   t   t   of degree     ≤   2  g       absent    2  g     \leq 2g   . The Alexander polynomial is independent of the choice of Seifert surface   S   S   S   , and is an invariant of the knot or link.  The signature of a knot is the signature of the symmetric Seifert matrix    V  +   V  ⊤       V   superscript  V  top     V+V^{\top}   . It is again an invariant of the knot or link.  Genus of a knot  Seifert surfaces are not at all unique: a Seifert surface S of genus g and Seifert matrix V can be modified by a surgery , to be replaced by a Seifert surface S ' of genus g+1 and Seifert matrix   V'=V    \oplus \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\ 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.  The genus of a knot K is the knot invariant defined by the minimal genus  g of a Seifert surface for K .  For instance:   An unknot —which is, by definition, the boundary of a disc —has genus zero. Moreover, the unknot is the only knot with genus zero.  The trefoil knot has genus one, as does the figure-eight knot .  The genus of a ( p , q )- torus knot is ( p − 1)( q − 1)/2  The degree of the Alexander polynomial is a lower bound on twice the genus of the knot.   A fundamental property of the genus is that it is additive with respect to the knot sum :       g   (    K  1   #   K  2    )    =    g   (   K  1   )    +   g   (   K  2   )           g     subscript  K  1   normal-#   subscript  K  2         g   subscript  K  1      g   subscript  K  2       g(K_{1}\#K_{2})=g(K_{1})+g(K_{2})     See also   Crosscap number  Arf invariant of a knot   References  External links   The SeifertView programme of Jack van Wijk visualizes the Seifert surfaces of knots constructed using Seifert's algorithm.
