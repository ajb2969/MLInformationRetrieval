   Uncompetitive inhibitor      Uncompetitive inhibitor   Uncompetitive inhibition , also known as anti-competitive inhibition , takes place when an enzyme inhibitor binds only to the complex formed between the enzyme and the substrate (the E-S complex).  While uncompetitive inhibition requires that an enzyme-substrate complex must be formed, non-competitive inhibition can occur with or without the substrate present.  Mechanism  This reduction in the effective concentration of the E-S complex increases the enzyme's apparent affinity for the substrate through Le Chatelier's principle ( K m is lowered) and decreases the maximum enzyme activity (V max ), as it takes longer for the substrate or product to leave the active site . Uncompetitive inhibition works best when substrate concentration is high. An uncompetitive inhibitor need not resemble the substrate of the reaction it is inhibiting.  Mathematical definition  The Lineweaver–Burk equation states that:        1  v    =     K  m     V   m  a  x     [  S  ]     +   1   V  max           1  v        subscript  K  m      subscript  V    m  a  x     delimited-[]  S       1   subscript  V        \ \frac{1}{v}=\frac{K_{m}}{V_{max}[S]}+{1\over V_{\max}}   Where v is the initial reaction velocity , K m is the Michaelis–Menten constant , V max is the maximum reaction velocity, and [ S ] is the concentration of the substrate. 1  The Lineweaver–Burk plot for an uncompetitive inhibitor produces a line parallel to the original enzyme-substrate plot, but with a higher y-intercept , due to the presence of an inhibition term      [  I  ]    K  i         delimited-[]  I    subscript  K  i     \ \frac{[I]}{K_{i}}   :        1  v    =     K  m     V   m  a  x     [  S  ]     +    1  +    [  I  ]    K  i      V   m  a  x            1  v        subscript  K  m      subscript  V    m  a  x     delimited-[]  S         1     delimited-[]  I    subscript  K  i      subscript  V    m  a  x        \ \frac{1}{v}=\frac{K_{m}}{V_{max}[S]}+\frac{1+\frac{[I]}{K_{i}}}{V_{max}}   Where [ I ] is the concentration of the inhibitor and K i is an inhibition constant characteristic of the inhibitor. 2 3  References  "  Category:Enzyme kinetics  Category:Enzyme inhibitors     ↩  ↩  ↩
