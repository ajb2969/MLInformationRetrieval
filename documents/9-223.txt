   Resolvent set      Resolvent set   In linear algebra and operator theory , the resolvent set of a linear operator is a set of complex numbers for which the operator is in some sense " well-behaved ". The resolvent set plays an important role in the resolvent formalism .  Definitions  Let X be a Banach space and let    L  :    D   (  L  )    →  X      normal-:  L   normal-→    D  L   X     L\colon D(L)\rightarrow X   be a linear operator with domain      D   (  L  )    ⊆  X        D  L   X    D(L)\subseteq X   . Let id denote the identity operator on X . For any    λ  ∈  ℂ      λ  ℂ    \lambda\in\mathbb{C}   , let        L  λ   =   L  -   λ  id     .       subscript  L  λ     L    λ  id      L_{\lambda}=L-\lambda\mathrm{id}.      λ   λ   \lambda   is said to be a regular value if    R   (  λ  ,  L  )       R   λ  L     R(\lambda,L)   , the inverse operator to    L  λ     subscript  L  λ    L_{\lambda}      exists;  is a bounded linear operator ;  is defined on a dense subspace of X .   The resolvent set of L is the set of all regular values of L :        ρ   (  L  )    =   {   λ  ∈  ℂ   |   λ  is a regular value of  L   }    .        ρ  L    conditional-set    λ  ℂ     λ  is a regular value of  L      \rho(L)=\{\lambda\in\mathbb{C}|\lambda\mbox{ is a regular value of }L\}.     The spectrum is the complement of the resolvent set:        σ   (  L  )    =   ℂ  ∖   ρ   (  L  )      .        σ  L     ℂ    ρ  L      \sigma(L)=\mathbb{C}\setminus\rho(L).     The spectrum can be further decomposed into the point/discrete spectrum (where condition 1 fails), the continuous spectrum (where conditions 1 and 3 hold but condition 2 fails) and the residual/compression spectrum (where condition 1 holds but condition 3 fails).  Properties   The resolvent set     ρ   (  L  )    ⊆  ℂ        ρ  L   ℂ    \rho(L)\subseteq\mathbb{C}   of a bounded linear operator L is an open set .
