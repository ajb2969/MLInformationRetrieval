Resolvent set

In linear algebra and operator theory, the resolvent set of a linear operator is a set of complex numbers for which the operator is in some sense "well-behaved". The resolvent set plays an important role in the resolvent formalism.
Definitions
Let X be a Banach space and let 
 
 
 
  be a linear operator with domain

 
 . Let id denote the identity operator on X. For any 
 
 
 
 , let



 
  is said to be a regular value if 
 
 
 
 , the inverse operator to 
 
 


exists;
is a bounded linear operator;
is defined on a dense subspace of X.

The resolvent set of L is the set of all regular values of L:



The spectrum is the complement of the resolvent set:



The spectrum can be further decomposed into the point/discrete spectrum (where condition 1 fails), the continuous spectrum (where conditions 1 and 3 hold but condition 2 fails) and the residual/compression spectrum (where condition 1 holds but condition 3 fails).
Properties

The resolvent set 
 
 
 
  of a bounded linear operator L is an open set.
