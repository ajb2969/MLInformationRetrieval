In differential geometry , the associate family (or Bonnet family) of a minimal surface is a one-parameter family of minimal surfaces which share the same Weierstrass data . That is, if the surface has the representation         x  k    (  ζ  )    =    ℜ   {    ∫  0  ζ     φ  k    (  z  )   d  z    }    +   c  k     ,   k  =   1  ,  2  ,  3       formulae-sequence       subscript  x  k   ζ         superscript   subscript   0   ζ      subscript  φ  k   z  d  z      subscript  c  k       k   1  2  3      x_{k}(\zeta)=\Re\left\{\int_{0}^{\zeta}\varphi_{k}(z)\,dz\right\}+c_{k},\qquad

 \right\}+c_{k},\qquad\theta\in[0,2\pi]     For θ = π /2 the surface is called the conjugate of the θ = 0 surface. 1  The transformation can be viewed as locally rotating the principal curvature directions. The surface normals of a point with a fixed ζ remains unchanged as θ changes; the point itself moves along an ellipse.  Some examples of associate surface families are: the catenoid and helicoid family, the Schwarz P , Schwarz D and gyroid family, and the Scherk's first and second surface family. The Enneper surface is conjugate to itself: it is left invariant as θ changes.  Conjugate surfaces have the property that any straight line on a surface maps to a planar geodesic on its conjugate surface and vice versa. If a patch of one surface is bounded by a straight line, then the conjugate patch is bounded by a planar symmetry line. This is useful for constructing minimal surfaces by going to the conjugate space: being bound by planes is equivalent to being bound by a polygon. 2  There are counterparts to the associate families of minimal surfaces in higher-dimensional spaces and manifolds. 3  References  "  Category:Differential geometry  Category:Minimal surfaces     Matthias Weber, Classical Minimal Surfaces in Euclidean Space by Examples, in Global Theory of Minimal Surfaces: Proceedings of the Clay Mathematics Institute 2001 Summer School, Mathematical Sciences Research Institute, Berkeley, California, June 25–July 27, 2001.
