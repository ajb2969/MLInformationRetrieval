Its points of inflexion are at     (  θ  ,  r  )   =   (   1  2   ,    2  k    )        θ  r      1  2       2  k       (\theta,r)=(\tfrac{1}{2},\sqrt{2k})   and    (   1  2   ,   -    2  k     )       1  2         2  k       (\tfrac{1}{2},-\sqrt{2k})   .  The curve was named for the ancient Roman lituus by Roger Cotes in a collection of papers entitled Harmonia Mensurarum (1722), which was published six years after his death.
