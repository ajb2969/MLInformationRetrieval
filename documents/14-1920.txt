Bangdiwala's B
'''Bangdiwala's B''' statistic was created by Bangdiwala in 1985 and is a measure of [[inter-rater agreement]].Bangwidala S (1985) A graphical test for observer agreement.

J Rehabil Med 39(1):71-76123 While it is principally used as a graphical aid to inter observer agreement, its asymptotic distribution is known.
Definition
The test is applicable to testing the agreement between two observers. It is defined to be



where nii are the values on the main diagonal. B varies in value between 0 (no agreement) and +1 (perfect agreement).
In large samples B has a normal distribution whose variance has a complicated expression.4 For small samples a permutation test is indicated.5
Guidance on its use and its extension to n x n tables have been provided by Munoz & Bangdiwala.6 It may be more useful than the more commonly used Cohen's kappa in some circumstances.7
Tutorials and examples
Worked examples of the use of Bangdiwala's B have been published.89 The statistical programming language R has a set of functions that will compute the B test,10 and a tutorial on the use of a test using these R functions is available.11
