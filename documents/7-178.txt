   Axiomatic design      Axiomatic design   Axiomatic design is a systems design  methodology using matrix methods to systematically analyze the transformation of customer needs into functional requirements, design parameters, and process variables. *Suh (1990), The Principles of Design , Oxford University Press, 1990, ISBN 0-19-504345-6   Suh (2001).

 FR_{2}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}A_{11}&A_{12}\\
 A_{21}&A_{22}\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}DP_{1}\\
 DP_{2}\end{bmatrix}     The method gets its name from its use of design principles or design Axioms (i.e., given without proof) governing the analysis and decision making process in developing high quality product or system designs. The two axioms used in Axiomatic Design (AD) are:   Axiom 1: The Independence Axiom . Maintain the independence of the functional requirements (FRs).  Axiom 2: The Information Axiom . Minimize the information content of the design.   Axiomatic design is considered to be a design method that addresses fundamental issues in Taguchi methods .  The methodology was developed by Dr. Suh Nam Pyo at MIT, Department of Mechanical Engineering since the 1990s. A series of academic conferences have been held to present current developments of the methodology. The most recent International Conference on Axiomatic Design (ICAD) was the 8th ICAD hosted by the Faculdade de Ciências e Tecnologia, Universidade Nova de Lisboa, Portugal in 2014. 1  See also   Dependency structure matrix (DSM)  New product development (NPD)  Design for Six Sigma  Six Sigma  Taguchi methods  Axiomatic product development lifecycle (APDL)  C-K theory   References     External links  A discussion of the methodology is given here:   Axiomatic Design for Complex Systems is a professional short course offered at MIT  Axiomatic Design Technology described by Axiomatic Design Solutions, Inc.
