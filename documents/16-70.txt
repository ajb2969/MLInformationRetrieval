(+)-delta-selinene synthase




(+)-delta-selinene synthase

(+)-delta-selinene synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((+)-delta-selinene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-delta-selinene + diphosphate


Initial cyclization gives germacrene C in an enzyme bound form.
