   Disk algebra      Disk algebra   In functional and complex analysis , the disk algebra  A ( D ) (also spelled disc algebra ) is the set of holomorphic functions   f : D → C ,   where D is the open unit disk in the complex plane  C , f extends to a continuous function on the closure of D . That is,        A   (  𝐃  )    =     H  ∞    (  𝐃  )    ∩   C   (   𝐃  ¯   )      ,        A  𝐃        superscript  H    𝐃     C   normal-¯  𝐃       A(\mathbf{D})=H^{\infty}(\mathbf{D})\cap C(\overline{\mathbf{D}}),   where     H  ∞    (  𝐃  )        superscript  H    𝐃    H^{\infty}(\mathbf{D})   denotes the Banach space of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc D (i.e. a Hardy space ). When endowed with the pointwise addition, (f+g)(z)=f(z)+g(z), and pointwise multiplication,   (fg)(z)=f(z)g(z),   this set becomes an algebra over C , since if ƒ and g belong to the disk algebra then so do ƒ + g and ƒg .  Given the uniform norm ,        ∥  f  ∥   =   sup   {   |   f   (  z  )    |   ∣   z  ∈  𝐃   }    =   max   {   |   f   (  z  )    |   ∣   z  ∈   𝐃  ¯    }     ,         norm  f    supremum   conditional-set      f  z      z  𝐃                f  z      z   normal-¯  𝐃        \|f\|=\sup\{|f(z)|\mid z\in\mathbf{D}\}=\max\{|f(z)|\mid z\in\overline{\mathbf%
 {D}}\},   by construction it becomes a uniform algebra and a commutative Banach algebra .  By construction the disc algebra is a closed subalgebra of the Hardy space  H ∞ . In contrast to the stronger requirement that a continuous extension to the circle exists, it is a lemma of Fatou that a general element of H ∞ can be radially extended to the circle almost everywhere .
