Disk algebra

In functional and complex analysis, the disk algebra A(D) (also spelled disc algebra) is the set of holomorphic functions

f : D → C,
 

where D is the open unit disk in the complex plane C, f extends to a continuous function on the closure of D. That is,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Banach space of bounded analytic functions on the unit disc D (i.e. a Hardy space). When endowed with the pointwise addition, (f+g)(z)=f(z)+g(z), and pointwise multiplication,

(fg)(z)=f(z)g(z),
 

this set becomes an algebra over C, since if ƒ and g belong to the disk algebra then so do ƒ + g and ƒg.
Given the uniform norm,


 
  by construction it becomes a uniform algebra and a commutative Banach algebra.
By construction the disc algebra is a closed subalgebra of the Hardy space H∞. In contrast to the stronger requirement that a continuous extension to the circle exists, it is a lemma of Fatou that a general element of H∞ can be radially extended to the circle almost everywhere.
