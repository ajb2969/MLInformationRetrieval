   Fuel fraction      Fuel fraction   (Figure)  The GlobalFlyer had a fuel fraction near 85% — it could carry five times its weight in fuel.   In aerospace engineering , an aircraft's fuel fraction , fuel weight fraction , 1 or a spacecraft's propellant fraction , is the weight of the fuel or propellant divided by the gross take-off weight of the craft (including propellant): 2       ζ   =    Δ  W    W  1        ζ      normal-Δ  W    subscript  W  1      \ \zeta=\frac{\Delta W}{W_{1}}     The fractional result of this mathematical division is often expressed as a percent. For aircraft with external drop tanks , the term internal fuel fraction is used to exclude the weight of external tanks and fuel.  Fuel fraction is a key parameter in determining an aircraft's range, the distance it can fly without refueling . Breguet ’s aircraft range equation describes the relationship of range with airspeed , lift-to-drag ratio , specific fuel consumption , and the part of the total fuel fraction available for cruise, also known as the cruise fuel fraction , or ' cruise fuel weight fraction '. 3  Fighter aircraft  At today’s state of the art for jet fighter aircraft , fuel fractions of 29 percent and below typically yield subcruisers; 33 percent provides a quasi– supercruiser ; and 35 percent and above are needed for useful supercruising missions. The U.S. F-22 Raptor ’s fuel fraction is 29 percent, 4  Eurofighter is 31 percent, both similar to those of the subcruising F-4 Phantom II , F-15 Eagle and the Russian Mikoyan MiG-29 "Fulcrum". The Russian supersonic interceptor, the Mikoyan MiG-31 "Foxhound", has a fuel fraction of over 45 percent. 5 The Panavia Tornado had a relatively low internal fuel fraction of 26 percent, and frequently carried drop tanks. 6  Airliners  Airliners typically have a fuel fraction between 25 and 45 percent, so less than half their takeoff weight is fuel. The Boeing 777-200 -IGW very long range airliner has a fuel fraction of 47 percent. 7 The Concorde  supersonic transport had a high fuel fraction of around 55%. 8  General aviation  The Rutan Voyager took off on its 1986 around-the-world flight at 72 percent, the highest figure ever at the time. 9  Steve Fossett 's Virgin Atlantic GlobalFlyer could attain a fuel fraction of nearly 85 percent, meaning that it carried more than five times its empty weight in fuel. 10  See also   Mass ratio   References  "  Category:Aerospace engineering     ↩  ↩  ↩  8200/27900 = 0.29 ↩  The F-22 Program FACT VERSUS FICTION by Everest E.
