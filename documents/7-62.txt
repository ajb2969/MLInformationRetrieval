Symmetrically continuous function




Symmetrically continuous function

In mathematics, a function 
 
 
 
  is symmetrically continuous at a point ''x



The usual definition of continuity implies symmetric continuity, but the converse is not true. For example, the function 
 
 
 
  is symmetrically continuous at 
 
 
 
 , but not continuous.
Also, symmetric differentiability implies symmetric continuity, but the converse is not true just like usual continuity does not imply differentiability.
