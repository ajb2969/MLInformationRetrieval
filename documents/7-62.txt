   Symmetrically continuous function      Symmetrically continuous function   In mathematics , a function    f  :   ℝ  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}   is symmetrically continuous at a point ''x         lim   h  →  0     f   (   x  +  h   )     -   f   (   x  -  h   )     =  0.          subscript    normal-→  h  0      f    x  h       f    x  h     0.    \lim_{h\to 0}f(x+h)-f(x-h)=0.     The usual definition of continuity implies symmetric continuity, but the converse is not true. For example, the function    x   -  2      superscript  x    2     x^{-2}   is symmetrically continuous at    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   , but not continuous.  Also, symmetric differentiability implies symmetric continuity, but the converse is not true just like usual continuity does not imply differentiability.
