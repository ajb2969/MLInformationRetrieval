   Hull‚ÄìWhite model      Hull‚ÄìWhite model   In financial mathematics , the Hull‚ÄìWhite model is a model of future interest rates . In its most generic formulation, it belongs to the class of no-arbitrage models that are able to fit today's term structure of interest rates. It is relatively straightforward to translate the mathematical description of the evolution of future interest rates onto a tree or lattice and so interest rate derivatives such as bermudan swaptions can be valued in the model.  The first Hull‚ÄìWhite model was described by John C. Hull and Alan White in 1990. The model is still popular in the market today.  The model  One-factor model  The model is a short-rate model . In general, it has dynamics       d  r   (  t  )    =     [    Œ∏   (  t  )    -   Œ±   (  t  )   r   (  t  )     ]   d  t   +   œÉ   (  t  )   d  W   (  t  )           d  r  t        delimited-[]      Œ∏  t     Œ±  t  r  t     d  t     œÉ  t  d  W  t      dr(t)=\left[\theta(t)-\alpha(t)r(t)\right]\,dt+\sigma(t)\,dW(t)\,\!     There is a degree of ambiguity amongst practitioners about exactly which parameters in the model are time-dependent or what name to apply to the model in each case. The most commonly accepted hierarchy has   Œ∏ and Œ± constant ‚Äì the Vasicek model   Œ∏ has t dependence ‚Äì the Hull-White model   Œ∏ and Œ± also time-dependent ‚Äì the extended Vasicek model    Two-factor model  The two-factor Hull‚ÄìWhite model  contains an additional disturbance term whose mean reverts to zero, and is of the form:        d   f   (   r   (  t  )    )    =     [     Œ∏   (  t  )    +  u   -   Œ±   (  t  )   f   (   r   (  t  )    )     ]   d  t   +    œÉ  1    (  t  )   d   W  1    (  t  )           d  f    r  t         delimited-[]        Œ∏  t   u     Œ±  t  f    r  t      d  t      subscript  œÉ  1   t  d   subscript  W  1   t      d\,f(r(t))=\left[\theta(t)+u-\alpha(t)\,f(r(t))\right]dt+\sigma_{1}(t)\,dW_{1}%
 (t)\!     where   u   u   \displaystyle u   has an initial value of 0 and follows the process:       d  u   =    -   b   u   d  t    +     œÉ  2    d   W  2    (  t  )           d  u         b  u  d  t       subscript  œÉ  2   d   subscript  W  2   t      du=-bu\,dt+\sigma_{2}\,dW_{2}(t)     Analysis of the one-factor model  For the rest of this article we assume only   Œ∏   Œ∏   \theta   has t-dependence. Neglecting the stochastic term for a moment, notice that the change in r is negative if r is currently "large" (greater than Œ∏( t )/Œ±) and positive if the current value is small. That is, the stochastic process is a mean-reverting  Ornstein‚ÄìUhlenbeck process .  Œ∏ is calculated from the initial yield curve describing the current term structure of interest rates. Typically Œ± is left as a user input (for example it may be estimated from historical data). œÉ is determined via calibration to a set of caplets and swaptions readily tradeable in the market.

Bond pricing using the Hull‚ÄìWhite model  It turns out that the time- S value of the T -maturity discount bond has distribution (note the affine term structure here!)       P   (  S  ,  T  )    =   A   (  S  ,  T  )    exp   (   -   B   (  S  ,  T  )   r   (  S  )     )           P   S  T      A   S  T         B   S  T   r  S        P(S,T)=A(S,T)\exp(-B(S,T)r(S))\!     where       B   (  S  ,  T  )    =     1  -   exp   (   -   Œ±   (   T  -  S   )     )     Œ±          B   S  T        1        Œ±    T  S       Œ±     B(S,T)=\frac{1-\exp(-\alpha(T-S))}{\alpha}\,          A   (  S  ,  T  )    =     P   (  0  ,  T  )     P   (  0  ,  S  )      exp   (    -   B   (  S  ,  T  )      ‚àÇ  log    (   P   (  0  ,  S  )    )     ‚àÇ  S      -     œÉ  2     (    exp   (   -   Œ±  T    )    -   exp   (   -   Œ±  S    )     )   2    (    exp   (   2  Œ±  S   )    -  1   )     4   Œ±  3      )           A   S  T          P   0  T      P   0  S             B   S  T            P   0  S       S           superscript  œÉ  2    superscript          Œ±  T           Œ±  S      2         2  Œ±  S    1      4   superscript  Œ±  3          A(S,T)=\frac{P(0,T)}{P(0,S)}\exp\left(\,-B(S,T)\frac{\partial\log(P(0,S))}{%
 \partial S}-\frac{\sigma^{2}(\exp(-\alpha T)-\exp(-\alpha S))^{2}(\exp(2\alpha
 S%
 )-1)}{4\alpha^{3}}\right)\,     Note that their terminal distribution for P ( S , T ) is distributed log-normally .  Derivative pricing  By selecting as numeraire the time- S bond (which corresponds to switching to the S-forward measure), we have from the fundamental theorem of arbitrage-free pricing , the value at time 0 of a derivative which has payoff at time S .      V   (  t  )   =  P   (  t  ,  S  )    ùîº  S    [  V   (  S  )   |  ‚Ñ±   (  t  )   ]   .     fragments  V   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-,  S  normal-)    subscript  ùîº  S    fragments  normal-[  V   fragments  normal-(  S  normal-)   normal-|  F   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-]   normal-.    V(t)=P(t,S)\mathbb{E}_{S}[V(S)|\mathcal{F}(t)].\,     Here,    ùîº  S     subscript  ùîº  S    \mathbb{E}_{S}   is the expectation taken with respect to the forward measure . Moreover that standard arbitrage arguments show that the time T forward price     F  V    (  t  ,  T  )        subscript  F  V    t  T     F_{V}(t,T)   for a payoff at time T given by V(T) must satisfy      F  V    (  t  ,  T  )    =     V   (  t  )    /  P    (  t  ,  T  )           subscript  F  V    t  T          V  t   P    t  T      F_{V}(t,T)=V(t)/P(t,T)   , thus       F  V    (  t  ,  T  )   =   ùîº  T    [  V   (  T  )   |  ‚Ñ±   (  t  )   ]   .     fragments   subscript  F  V    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-,  T  normal-)     subscript  ùîº  T    fragments  normal-[  V   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)   normal-|  F   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-]   normal-.    F_{V}(t,T)=\mathbb{E}_{T}[V(T)|\mathcal{F}(t)].\,     Thus it is possible to value many derivatives V dependent solely on a single bond P ( S , T ) analytically when working in the Hull‚ÄìWhite model. For example in the case of a bond put        V   (  S  )    =    (   K  -   P   (  S  ,  T  )     )   +    .        V  S    superscript    K    P   S  T         V(S)=(K-P(S,T))^{+}.\,     Because P ( S , T ) is lognormally distributed, the general calculation used for Black-Scholes shows that        E  S    [    (   K  -   P   (  S  ,  T  )     )   +   ]    =    K  N   (   -   d  2    )    -   F   (  t  ,  S  ,  T  )   N   (   d  1   )            subscript  E  S    delimited-[]   superscript    K    P   S  T             K  N     subscript  d  2       F   t  S  T   N   subscript  d  1       {E}_{S}[(K-P(S,T))^{+}]=KN(-d_{2})-F(t,S,T)N(d_{1})\,     where       d  1   =      log   (   F  /  K   )    +     œÉ  P  2   S   /  2      œÉ  P    S           subscript  d  1           F  K         superscript   subscript  œÉ  P   2   S   2       subscript  œÉ  P     S       d_{1}=\frac{\log(F/K)+\sigma_{P}^{2}S/2}{\sigma_{P}\sqrt{S}}\,     and        d  2   =    d  1   -    œÉ  P    S      .       subscript  d  2      subscript  d  1      subscript  œÉ  P     S       d_{2}=d_{1}-\sigma_{P}\sqrt{S}.\,     Thus today's value (with the P (0, S ) multiplied back in) is:       P   (  0  ,  S  )   K  N   (   -   d  2    )    -   P   (  0  ,  T  )   N   (   -   d  1    )          P   0  S   K  N     subscript  d  2       P   0  T   N     subscript  d  1       P(0,S)KN(-d_{2})-P(0,T)N(-d_{1})\,     Here œÉ P is the standard deviation of the log-normal distribution for P ( S , T ). A fairly substantial amount of algebra shows that it is related to the original parameters via        S    œÉ  P    =    œÉ  Œ±    (   1  -   exp   (   -   Œ±   (   T  -  S   )     )     )       1  -   exp   (   -   2  Œ±  S    )      2  Œ±               S    subscript  œÉ  P        œÉ  Œ±     1        Œ±    T  S             1        2  Œ±  S        2  Œ±        \sqrt{S}\sigma_{P}=\frac{\sigma}{\alpha}(1-\exp(-\alpha(T-S)))\sqrt{\frac{1-%
 \exp(-2\alpha S)}{2\alpha}}\,     Note that this expectation was done in the S-bond measure, whereas we did not specify a measure at all for the original Hull-White process. This does not matter ‚Äî the volatility is all that matters and is measure-independent.  Because interest rate caps/floors are equivalent to bond puts and calls respectively, the above analysis shows that caps and floors can be priced analytically in the Hull‚ÄìWhite model. Jamshidian's trick applies to Hull-White (as today's value of a swaption in HW is a monotonic function of today's short rate). Thus knowing how to price caps is also sufficient for pricing swaptions.  The swaptions can also be priced directly as described in Henrard (2003). The direct implementation is usually more efficient.  Trees and lattices  However, valuing vanilla instruments such as caps and swaptions is useful primarily for calibration. The real use of the model is to value somewhat more exotic derivatives such as bermudan swaptions on a lattice , or other derivatives in a multi-currency context such as Quanto Constant Maturity Swaps, as explained for example in Brigo and Mercurio (2001).
