Taurine—pyruvate aminotransferase

In enzymology, a taurine-pyruvate aminotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

taurine + pyruvate 
 
 
 
  L-alanine + 2-sulfoacetaldehyde
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are taurine and pyruvate, whereas its two products are L-alanine and 2-sulfoacetaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is taurine:pyruvate aminotransferase. This enzyme is also called Tpa. This enzyme participates in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism.
