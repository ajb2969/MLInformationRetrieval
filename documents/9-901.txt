It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 5-cube honeycomb .  It is the first tessellation in the demihypercube honeycomb family which, with all the next ones, is not regular, being composed of two different types of uniform  facets . The 5-cubes become alternated into 5-demicubes h{4,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 5-orthoplex {3,3,3,4} facets.  D5 lattice  The vertex arrangement of the 5-demicubic honeycomb is the D 5 lattice which is the densest known sphere packing in 5 dimensions. 1 The 40 vertices of the rectified 5-orthoplex  vertex figure of the 5-demicubic honeycomb reflect the kissing number 40 of this lattice. 2  The D     5     +     subscript   superscript  absent    5    {}^{+}_{5}   packing (also called D     5     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   5    {}^{2}_{5}   ) can be constructed by the union of two D 5 lattices. The analogous packings form lattices only in even dimensions. The kissing number is 2 4 =16 (2 n-1 for n8). 3    ∪    The D     5     *     subscript   superscript  absent    5    {}^{*}_{5}    4 lattice (also called D     5     4     subscript   superscript  absent  4   5    {}^{4}_{5}   and C     5     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   5    {}^{2}_{5}   ) can be constructed by the union of all four 5-demicubic lattices: 5 It is also the 5-dimensional body centered cubic , the union of two 5-cube honeycombs in dual positions.    ∪  ∪  ∪  =  ∪    The kissing number of the D     5     *     subscript   superscript  absent    5    {}^{*}_{5}   lattice is 10 ( 2n for n≥5) and it Voronoi tessellation is a tritruncated 5-cubic honeycomb , , containing all with bitruncated 5-orthoplex , Voronoi cells . 6  Symmetry constructions  There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of differened colors on the 32 5-demicube facets around each vertex.
