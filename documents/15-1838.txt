   Longest alternating subsequence      Longest alternating subsequence   In combinatorial mathematics, probability , and computer science , in the longest alternating subsequence problem, one wants to find a subsequence of a given sequence in which the elements are in alternating order, and in which the sequence is as long as possible.  Formally, if    𝐱  =   {   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   }       𝐱    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      \mathbf{x}=\{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}\}   is a sequence of distinct real numbers, then the subsequence    {   x   i  1    ,   x   i  2    ,  …  ,   x   i  k    }      subscript  x   subscript  i  1     subscript  x   subscript  i  2    normal-…   subscript  x   subscript  i  k      \{x_{i_{1}},x_{i_{2}},\ldots,x_{i_{k}}\}   is alternating 1 (or zigzag or down-up )if         x   i  1    >     x   i  2     <   x   i  3    >   ⋯   x   i  k     and     1  ≤   i  1   <   i  2   <  ⋯  <   i  k   ≤  n    .     formulae-sequence     subscript  x   subscript  i  1        subscript  x   subscript  i  2     expectation   subscript  x   subscript  i  3     normal-⋯   subscript  x   subscript  i  k     and        1   subscript  i  1         subscript  i  2        normal-⋯        subscript  i  k        n      x_{i_{1}}>x_{i_{2}} \cdots x_{i_{k}}\qquad\text{and}\qquad 1\leq i_{%

 1}     Let     as  n    (  𝐱  )        subscript  as  n   𝐱    {\rm as}_{n}(\mathbf{x})   denote the length (number of terms) of the longest alternating subsequence of   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   . For example, if we consider some of the permutations of the integers 1,2,3,4,5, we have that         as  5    (  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  5  )    =  2         subscript  as  5    1  2  3  4  5    2    {\rm as}_{5}(1,2,3,4,5)=2   ; because any sequence of 2 distinct digits are (by definition) alternating. (for example 1,2 or 1,4 or 3,5)         as  5    (  1  ,  5  ,  3  ,  2  ,  4  )    =  4   ,         subscript  as  5    1  5  3  2  4    4    {\rm as}_{5}(1,5,3,2,4)=4,   because 1,5,3,4 and 1,5,2,4 and 1,3,2,4 are all alternating, and there is no alternating subsequence with more elements;         as  5    (  5  ,  3  ,  4  ,  1  ,  2  )    =  5   ,         subscript  as  5    5  3  4  1  2    5    {\rm as}_{5}(5,3,4,1,2)=5,   because 5,3,4,1,2 is itself alternating.   Efficient algorithms  The longest alternating subsequence problem is solvable in time    O   (  n  )       O  n    O(n)   , where   n   n   n   is the length of the original sequence.  Distributional results  If   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   is a random permutation of the integers    1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  n     1  2  normal-…  n    1,2,\ldots,n   and     A  n   ≡    as  n    (  𝐱  )         subscript  A  n      subscript  as  n   𝐱     A_{n}\equiv{\rm as}_{n}(\mathbf{x})   , then it is possible to show 2 3 4 that         E   [   A  n   ]    =      2  n   3   +   1  6    and      Var   [   A  n   ]    =     8  n   45   -   13  180      .     formulae-sequence      E   delimited-[]   subscript  A  n            2  n   3     1  6    and       Var   subscript  A  n          8  n   45     13  180       E[A_{n}]=\frac{2n}{3}+\frac{1}{6}\qquad\text{and}\qquad\operatorname{Var}[A_{n%
 }]=\frac{8n}{45}-\frac{13}{180}.     Moreover, as    n  →  ∞     normal-→  n     n\rightarrow\infty   , the random variable    A  n     subscript  A  n    A_{n}   , appropriately centered and scaled, converges to a standard normal distribution.  Online algorithms  The longest alternating subsequence problem has also been studied in the setting of online algorithms , in which the elements of   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   are presented in an online fashion, and a decision maker needs to decide whether to include or exclude each element at the time it is first presented, without any knowledge of the elements that will be presented in the future, and without the possibility of recalling on preceding observations.  Given a sequence     X  1   ,   X  2   ,  …  ,   X  n       subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2   normal-…   subscript  X  n     X_{1},X_{2},\ldots,X_{n}   of independent random variables with common continuous distribution   F   F   F   , it is possible to construct a selection procedure that maximizes the expected number of alternating selections. Such expected values can be tightly estimated, and it equals      (   2  -   2    )   n   +   O   (  1  )            2    2    n     O  1     (2-\sqrt{2})n+O(1)   . 5  As    n  →  ∞     normal-→  n     n\rightarrow\infty   , the optimal number of online alternating selections appropriately centered and scaled converges to a normal distribution. 6  See also   Alternating permutation  Permutation pattern and pattern avoidance  Counting local maxima and/or local minima in a given sequence  Turning point tests for testing statistical independence of   n   n   n   observations  Number of alternating runs  Longest increasing subsequence  Longest common subsequence problem   References        "  Category:Problems on strings  Category:Permutations  Category:Combinatorics  Category:Probability  Category:Dynamic programming     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
