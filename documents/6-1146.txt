   Congruence (manifolds)      Congruence (manifolds)   In the theory of smooth manifolds , a congruence is the set of integral curves defined by a nonvanishing vector field defined on the manifold.  Congruences are an important concept in general relativity , and are also important in parts of Riemannian geometry .  A motivational example  The idea of a congruence is probably better explained by giving an example than by a definition. Consider the smooth manifold R ². Vector fields can be specified as first order linear partial differential operators , such as       X  →   =     (    x  2   -   y  2    )    ∂  x    +    2   x   y    ∂  y          normal-→  X          superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     subscript   x      2  x  y   subscript   y       \vec{X}=(x^{2}-y^{2})\,\partial_{x}+2\,xy\,\partial_{y}   These correspond to a system of first order linear ordinary differential equations , in this case        x  ˙   =    x  2   -   y  2     ,    y  ˙   =    2   x  y       formulae-sequence     normal-˙  x      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        normal-˙  y     2  x  y      \dot{x}=x^{2}-y^{2},\;\dot{y}=2\,xy   where dot denotes a derivative with respect to some (dummy) parameter. The solutions of such systems are families of parameterized curves , in this case       x   (  λ  )    =     x  0   -    (    x  0  2   +   y  0  2    )   λ      1  -    2     x  0    λ    +    (    x  0  2   +   y  0  2    )    λ  2            x  λ        subscript  x  0        superscript   subscript  x  0   2    superscript   subscript  y  0   2    λ        1    2   subscript  x  0   λ         superscript   subscript  x  0   2    superscript   subscript  y  0   2     superscript  λ  2        x(\lambda)=\frac{x_{0}-(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2})\,\lambda}{1-2\,x_{0}\,\lambda+(x_%
 {0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2})\,\lambda^{2}}          y   (  λ  )    =    y  0     1  -    2     x  0    λ    +    (    x  0  2   +   y  0  2    )    λ  2            y  λ      subscript  y  0       1    2   subscript  x  0   λ         superscript   subscript  x  0   2    superscript   subscript  y  0   2     superscript  λ  2        y(\lambda)=\frac{y_{0}}{1-2\,x_{0}\,\lambda+(x_{0}^{2}+y_{0}^{2})\,\lambda^{2}}   This family is what is often called a congruence of curves , or just congruence for short.  This particular example happens to have two singularities , where the vector field vanishes. These are fixed points of the flow . (A flow is a one-dimensional group of diffeomorphisms ; a flow defines an action by the one-dimensional Lie group  R , having locally nice geometric properties.) These two singularities correspond to two points , rather than two curves. In this example, the other integral curves are all simple closed curves . Many flows are considerably more complicated than this. To avoid complications arising from the presence of singularities, usually one requires the vector field to be nonvanishing .  If we add more mathematical structure, our congruence may acquire new significance.  Congruences in Riemannian manifolds  For example, if we make our smooth manifold into a Riemannian manifold by adding a Riemannian metric tensor , say the one defined by the line element       d   s  2    =      (   2   1  +   x  2   +   y  2     )   2     (    d   x  2    +   d   y  2     )          d   superscript  s  2       superscript    2    1   superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     2       d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2        ds^{2}=\left(\frac{2}{1+x^{2}+y^{2}}\right)^{2}\,\left(dx^{2}+dy^{2}\right)   our congruence might become a geodesic congruence . Indeed, in the example from the preceding section, our curves become geodesics on an ordinary round sphere (with the North pole excised). If we had added the standard Euclidean metric     d   s  2    =    d   x  2    +   d   y  2           d   superscript  s  2        d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2       ds^{2}=dx^{2}+dy^{2}   instead, our curves would have become circles , but not geodesics.  An interesting example of a Riemannian geodesic congruence, related to our first example, is the Clifford congruence on P³, which is also known at the Hopf bundle or Hopf fibration . The integral curves or fibers respectively are certain pairwise linked great circles, the orbits in the space of unit norm quaternions under left multiplication by a given unit quaternion of unit norm.  Congruences in Lorentzian manifolds  In a Lorentzian manifold , such as a spacetime model in general relativity (which will usually be an exact or approximate solution to the Einstein field equation ), congruences are called timelike , null , or spacelike if the tangent vectors are everywhere timelike, null, or spacelike respectively. A congruence is called a geodesic congruence if the tangent vector field    X  →     normal-→  X    \vec{X}   has vanishing covariant derivative ,      ∇   X  →     X  →    =  0        subscript  normal-∇   normal-→  X     normal-→  X    0    \nabla_{\vec{X}}\vec{X}=0   .
