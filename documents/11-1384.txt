Urate-ribonucleotide phosphorylase

In enzymology, an urate-ribonucleotide phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

urate D-ribonucleotide + phosphate 
 
 
 
  urate + alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are urate D-ribonucleotide and phosphate, whereas its two products are urate and alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is urate-ribonucleotide:phosphate alpha-D-ribosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UAR phosphorylase, and urate-ribonucleotide:phosphate D-ribosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in purine metabolism.
