   Morphine 6-dehydrogenase      Morphine 6-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a morphine 6-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   morphine + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   morphinone + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are morphine , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are morphinone , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is morphine:NAD(P) + 6-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include naloxone reductase , and reductase, naloxone . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i . This enzyme has at least one effector , Mercaptoethanol .
