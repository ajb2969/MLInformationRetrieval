Haynsworth inertia additivity formula

In mathematics, the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula, discovered by Emilie Virginia Haynsworth1 (1916–1985), concerns the number of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix and of block matrices into which it is partitioned.
The inertia of a Hermitian matrix H is defined as the ordered triple



whose components are respectively the numbers of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of H. Haynsworth considered a partitioned Hermitian matrix



where H11 is nonsingular and H12* is the conjugate transpose of H12. The formula states:2[http://books.google.com/books?id=Wjd8_AwjiIIC&pg;;=PA15&lpg;=PA15&dq;=haynsworth+inertia&source;=bl&ots;=jpVOPR63Ps&sig;=C7H_0a44_aC2RKpKuM91zHdKEaI&hl;=en&ei;=4SazTa6lCemW0QGg6_WzCQ&sa;=X&oi;=book_result&ct;=result&resnum;=3&sqi;=2&ved;=0CCQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q;=haynsworth%20inertia&f;=false]



where H/H11 is the Schur complement of H11 in H:



Generalization
If H11 is singular, we can still define the generalized Schur complement, using the Moore–Penrose inverse  instead of .
The formula does not hold if H11 is singular. However, a generalization has been proven in 1974 by Carlson, Haynsworth and Markham,3 to the effect that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Carlson, Haynsworth and Markham also gave sufficient and necessary conditions for equality to hold.
