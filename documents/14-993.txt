   Haynsworth inertia additivity formula      Haynsworth inertia additivity formula   In mathematics, the Haynsworth inertia additivity formula , discovered by Emilie Virginia Haynsworth 1 (1916–1985), concerns the number of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix and of block matrices into which it is partitioned .  The inertia of a Hermitian matrix H is defined as the ordered triple       In   (  H  )    =   (   π   (  H  )    ,   ν   (  H  )    ,   δ   (  H  )    )         In  H      π  H     ν  H     δ  H      \mathrm{In}(H)=\left(\pi(H),\nu(H),\delta(H)\right)\,     whose components are respectively the numbers of positive, negative, and zero eigenvalues of H . Haynsworth considered a partitioned Hermitian matrix      H  =   [      H  11      H  12        H  12  ∗      H  22      ]       H     subscript  H  11    subscript  H  12      superscript   subscript  H  12   normal-∗    subscript  H  22       H=\begin{bmatrix}H_{11}&H_{12}\\
 H_{12}^{\ast}&H_{22}\end{bmatrix}     where H 11 is nonsingular and H 12 * is the conjugate transpose of H 12 .

 H_{12}^{\ast}&H_{22}\end{bmatrix}=\mathrm{In}(H_{11})+\mathrm{In}(H/H_{11})     where H / H 11 is the Schur complement of H 11 in H :        H  /   H  11    =    H  22   -    H  12  ∗    H  11   -  1     H  12      .

The formula does not hold if H 11 is singular. However, a generalization has been proven in 1974 by Carlson, Haynsworth and Markham, 3 to the effect that     π   (  H  )    ≥    π   (   H  11   )    +   π   (   H  /   H  11    )           π  H       π   subscript  H  11      π    H   subscript  H  11        \pi(H)\geq\pi(H_{11})+\pi(H/H_{11})   and     ν   (  H  )    ≥    ν   (   H  11   )    +   ν   (   H  /   H  11    )           ν  H       ν   subscript  H  11      ν    H   subscript  H  11        \nu(H)\geq\nu(H_{11})+\nu(H/H_{11})   .  Carlson, Haynsworth and Markham also gave sufficient and necessary conditions for equality to hold.
