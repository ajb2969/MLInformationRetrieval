   Duffing equation      Duffing equation   The Duffing equation (or Duffing oscillator ), named after Georg Duffing , is a non-linear second-order differential equation used to model certain damped and driven oscillators . The equation is given by        x  ¨   +   δ   x  ˙    +   α  x   +   β   x  3     =   γ   cos   (   ω  t   )            normal-¨  x     δ   normal-˙  x      α  x     β   superscript  x  3       γ      ω  t       \ddot{x}+\delta\dot{x}+\alpha x+\beta x^{3}=\gamma\cos(\omega t)\,     where the (unknown) function x = x ( t ) is the displacement at time t ,    x  ˙     normal-˙  x    \dot{x}   is the first derivative of x with respect to time, i.e. velocity , and    x  ¨     normal-¨  x    \ddot{x}   is the second time-derivative of x , i.e. acceleration . The numbers   δ   δ   \delta   ,   α   α   \alpha   ,   β   β   \beta   ,   γ   γ   \gamma   and   ω   ω   \omega   are given constants.  The equation describes the motion of a damped oscillator with a more complicated potential than in simple harmonic motion (which corresponds to the case β=δ=0); in physical terms, it models, for example, a spring pendulum whose spring's stiffness does not exactly obey Hooke's law .  The Duffing equation is an example of a dynamical system that exhibits chaotic behavior . Moreover, the Duffing system presents in the frequency response the jump resonance phenomenon that is a sort of frequency hysteresis behaviour.  Parameters      δ   δ   \delta   controls the size of the damping .     α   α   \alpha   controls the size of the stiffness .     β   β   \beta   controls the amount of non-linearity in the restoring force. If    β  =  0      β  0    \beta=0   , the Duffing equation describes a damped and driven simple harmonic oscillator.     γ   γ   \gamma   controls the amplitude of the periodic driving force. If    γ  =  0      γ  0    \gamma=0   we have a system without driving force.     ω   ω   \omega   controls the frequency of the periodic driving force.   Methods of solution  In general, the Duffing equation does not admit an exact symbolic solution. However, many approximate methods work well:   Expansion in a Fourier series will provide an equation of motion to arbitrary precision.  The    x  3     superscript  x  3    x^{3}   term, also called the Duffing term , can be approximated as small and the system treated as a perturbed simple harmonic oscillator.  The Frobenius method yields a complicated but workable solution.  Any of the various numeric methods such as Euler's method and Runge-Kutta can be used.   In the special case of the undamped (    δ  =  0      δ  0    \delta=0   ) and undriven (    γ  =  0      γ  0    \gamma=0   ) Duffing equation, an exact solution can be obtained using Jacobi's elliptic functions .  Boundedness of the solution for the undamped and unforced oscillator  Multiplication of the undamped and unforced Duffing equation,     γ  =  δ  =  0   ,        γ  δ       0     \gamma=\delta=0,   with    x  ˙     normal-˙  x    \dot{x}   gives: 1        x  ˙    (    x  ¨   +   α  x   +   β   x  3     )    =  0         normal-˙  x      normal-¨  x     α  x     β   superscript  x  3      0    \displaystyle\dot{x}\left(\ddot{x}+\alpha x+\beta x^{3}\right)=0     with H a constant. The value of H is determined by the initial conditions    x   (  0  )       x  0    x(0)   and      x  ˙    (  0  )    .       normal-˙  x   0    \dot{x}(0).     The substitution    y  =   x  ˙       y   normal-˙  x     y=\dot{x}   in H shows that the system is Hamiltonian :        x  ˙   =   +    ∂  H    ∂  y      ,       normal-˙  x         H     y       \dot{x}=+\frac{\partial H}{\partial y},        y  ˙   =   -    ∂  H    ∂  x          normal-˙  y         H     x       \dot{y}=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial x}   with      H   =     1  2    y  2    +    1  2   α   x  2    +    1  4   β   x  4      .      H        1  2    superscript  y  2        1  2   α   superscript  x  2        1  4   β   superscript  x  4       \quad H=\tfrac{1}{2}y^{2}+\tfrac{1}{2}\alpha x^{2}+\tfrac{1}{4}\beta x^{4}.     When both   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   are positive, the solution is bounded: 2       |  x  |   ≤     2  H   /  α          x         2  H   α      |x|\leq\sqrt{2H/\alpha}   and      |   x  ˙   |   ≤    2  H     ,         normal-˙  x        2  H      |\dot{x}|\leq\sqrt{2H},     with the Hamiltonian H being positive.
