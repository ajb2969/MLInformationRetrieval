   Magnetosonic wave      Magnetosonic wave   A magnetosonic wave (also magnetoacoustic wave ) is a longitudinal wave 1 of ions (and electrons ) in a magnetized plasma propagating perpendicular to the stationary magnetic field. The wave is dispersionless with a phase velocity ω/ k given by        ω  2    k  2    =     c  2       v  s  2   +   v  A  2      c  2   +   v  A  2             superscript  ω  2    superscript  k  2       superscript  c  2        superscript   subscript  v  s   2    superscript   subscript  v  A   2       superscript  c  2    superscript   subscript  v  A   2        \frac{\omega^{2}}{k^{2}}=c^{2}\,\frac{v_{s}^{2}+v_{A}^{2}}{c^{2}+v_{A}^{2}}   , where v s is the speed of the ion acoustic wave , v A is the speed of the Alfvén wave , and c is the speed of light in vacuum.  In the limit of low magnetic field ( v A →0), the wave turns into an ordinary ion acoustic wave . In the limit of low temperature ( v s →0), the wave becomes a modified Alfvén wave. Because the phase velocity of the magnetosonic mode is almost always larger than v A , the magnetosonic wave is often called the "fast" hydromagnetic wave .  Both fast and slow magnetoacoustic waves have been recently discovered in the solar corona , 2 which created an observational foundation for the novel technique for the coronal plasma diagnostics, coronal seismology .
