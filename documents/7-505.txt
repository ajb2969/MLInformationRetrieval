   53 equal temperament      53 equal temperament   In music, 53 equal temperament , called 53-TET, 53- EDO , or 53-ET, is the tempered scale derived by dividing the octave into 53 equal steps (equal frequency ratios).  Each step represents a frequency ratio of 2 1/53 , or 22.6415 cents (), an interval sometimes called the Holdrian comma .  53-TET is a tuning of equal temperament in which the tempered perfect fifth is 701.89 cents wide, as shown in Figure 1.  History  Theoretical interest in this division goes back to antiquity. Ching Fang (78–37 BC), a Chinese music theorist, observed that a series of 53 just fifths (     (   3  /  2   )   53     superscript    3  2   53    (3/2)^{53}   ) is very nearly equal to 31 octaves (     (   2  /  1   )   31     superscript    2  1   31    (2/1)^{31}   ). He calculated this difference with six-digit accuracy to be    177147  /  176776      177147  176776    177147/176776   . 1 Later the same observation was made by the mathematician and music theorist Nicholas Mercator (c. 1620–1687), who calculated this value precisely as    (     3  53   /   2  84    =   19383245667680019896796723  /  19342813113834066795298816    )         superscript  3  53    superscript  2  84      19383245667680019896796723  19342813113834066795298816     (3^{53}/2^{84}=19383245667680019896796723/19342813113834066795298816)   , which is known as Mercator's comma . 2 Mercator's comma is of such small value to begin with (≈ 3.615 cents), but 53 equal temperament flattens each fifth by only 1/53 of that comma (≈ 0.0682 cent ≈ 1/315 syntonic comma ). Thus, 53 equal temperament is for all practical purposes equivalent to an extended Pythagorean tuning .  After Mercator, William Holder published a treatise in 1694 which pointed out that 53 equal temperament also very closely approximates the just major third (to within 1.4 cents), and consequently 53 equal temperament accommodates the intervals of 5-limit  just intonation very well. 3 4 This property of 53-TET may have been known earlier; Isaac Newton 's unpublished manuscripts suggest that he had been aware of it as early as 1664–65. 5  Scale diagram      align=center Interval (steps)    colspan=2 align=center 3   colspan=2 align=center 2   colspan=2 align=center 4   colspan=2 align=center 3   colspan=2 align=center 2   colspan=2 align=center 3   colspan=2 align=center 2   colspan=2 align=center 1   colspan=2 align=center 2   colspan=2 align=center 4   colspan=2 align=center 1   colspan=2 align=center 4   colspan=2 align=center 3   colspan=2 align=center 2   colspan=2 align=center 3   colspan=2 align=center 4   colspan=2 align=center 2   colspan=2 align=center 3   colspan=2 align=center 2   colspan=2 align=center 1   colspan=2 align=center 2      align=center Interval (cents)    colspan=2 align=center 68   colspan=2 align=center 45   colspan=2 align=center 91   colspan=2 align=center 68   colspan=2 align=center 45   colspan=2 align=center 68   colspan=2 align=center 45   colspan=2 align=center 23   colspan=2 align=center 45   colspan=2 align=center 91   colspan=2 align=center 23   colspan=2 align=center 91   colspan=2 align=center 68   colspan=2 align=center 45   colspan=2 align=center 68   colspan=2 align=center 91   colspan=2 align=center 45   colspan=2 align=center 68   colspan=2 align=center 45   colspan=2 align=center 23   colspan=2 align=center 45      align=center Note name   colspan=2 align=center C 0   sharp}}  -3   flat}} 1   colspan=2 align=center D 0   sharp}} -3   flat}} 1   colspan=2 align=center E -1   flat}} 3   sharp}} -4   colspan=2 align=center F 0   sharp}} -2   flat}} 2   colspan=2 align=center G 0   sharp}} -3   flat}} 1   colspan=2 align=center A -1   sharp}} -3   flat}} 1   colspan=2 align=center B -1   flat}} 3   sharp}} -4   colspan=2 align=center C 0     align=center Note (cents)   colspan=2 align=center   0   colspan=2 align=center  68   colspan=2 align=center 113   colspan=2 align=center 204   colspan=2 align=center 272   colspan=2 align=center 317   colspan=2 align=center 385   colspan=2 align=center 430   colspan=2 align=center 453   colspan=2 align=center 498   colspan=2 align=center 589   colspan=2 align=center 611   colspan=2 align=center 702   colspan=2 align=center 770   colspan=2 align=center 815   colspan=2 align=center 883   colspan=2 align=center 974   colspan=2 align=center 1018   colspan=2 align=center 1087   colspan=2 align=center 1132   colspan=2 align=center 1155   colspan=2 align=center 1200     align=center Note (steps)   colspan=2 align=center 0   colspan=2 align=center 3   colspan=2 align=center 5   colspan=2 align=center 9   colspan=2 align=center 12   colspan=2 align=center 14   colspan=2 align=center 17   colspan=2 align=center 19   colspan=2 align=center 20   colspan=2 align=center 22   colspan=2 align=center 26   colspan=2 align=center 27   colspan=2 align=center 31   colspan=2 align=center 34   colspan=2 align=center 36   colspan=2 align=center 39   colspan=2 align=center 43   colspan=2 align=center 45   colspan=2 align=center 48   colspan=2 align=center 50   colspan=2 align=center 51   colspan=2 align=center 53     Comparison to other scales  Because a distance of 31 steps in this scale is almost precisely equal to a just  perfect fifth , in theory this scale can be considered a form of Pythagorean tuning that has been extended to 53 tones. As such the intervals available can have the same properties as any Pythagorean tuning, such as fifths that are (practically) pure, major thirds that are wide from just (about 81/64 opposed to the purer 5/4), and minor thirds that are conversely narrow (32/27 compared to 6/5).  However, 53-TET contains additional intervals that are very close to just intonation. For instance, the interval of 17 steps is also a major third, but only 1.4 cents narrower than the very pure just interval 5/4. 53-TET is very good as an approximation to any interval in 5-limit just intonation.  The matches to the just intervals involving the 7th harmonic are slightly less close, but all such intervals are still matched with the highest deviation being the 7:5 tritone. The 11th harmonic and intervals involving it are less closely matched, as illustrated with the undecimal neutral seconds and thirds in the table below.      align=center interval name   align=center size (steps)   align=center size (cents)   align=center just ratio   align=center just (cents)   align=center error     align=center harmonic seventh   align=center 43   align=center 973.59   align=center 7:4   align=center 968.83   align=center +4.76     perfect fifth   31   701.89   3:2   701.96   −0.07     diatonic tritone   26   588.68   45:32   590.22   −1.54     align=center septimal tritone   align=center 26   align=center 588.68   align=center 7:5   align=center 582.51   align=center +6.17     classic tritone   25   566.04   25:18   568.72   −2.68     align=center undecimal tritone   align=center 24   align=center 543.40   align=center 11:8   align=center 551.32   align=center −7.92     double diminished fifth   24   543.40   512:375   539.10     4.30     align=center undecimal augmented fourth   align=center 24   align=center 543.40   align=center 15:11   align=center 536.95   align=center +6.45     acute fourth   23   520.76   27:20   519.55     1.21     perfect fourth   22   498.11   4:3   498.04     0.07     grave fourth   21   475.47   320:243   476.54   −1.07     align=center septimal narrow fourth   align=center 21   align=center 475.47   align=center 21:16   align=center 470.78   align=center +4.69     classic augmented third   20   452.83   125:96   456.99   −4.16     tridecimal augmented third   20   452.83   13:10   454.21   −1.38     align=center septimal major third   align=center 19   align=center 430.19   align=center 9:7   align=center 435.08   align=center −4.90     classic diminished fourth   19   430.19   32:25   427.37     2.82     Pythagorean ditone   18   407.54   81:64   407.82   −0.28     just  major third   17   384.91   5:4   386.31   −1.40     neutral third , tridecimal   16   362.26   16:13   359.47     2.79     grave major third   16   362.26   100:81   364.80   −2.54     align=center neutral third , undecimal   align=center 15   align=center 339.62   align=center 11:9   align=center 347.41   align=center −7.79     acute minor third   15   339.62   243:200   337.15     2.47     just minor third   14   316.98   6:5   315.64     1.34     semiditone   13   294.34   32:27   294.13     0.21     classic augmented second   12   271.70   75:64   274.58   −2.88     align=center septimal minor third   align=center 12   align=center 271.70   align=center 7:6   align=center 266.87   align=center +4.83     classic diminished third   11   249.06   144:125   244.97     4.09     align=center septimal whole tone   align=center 10   align=center 226.41   align=center 8:7   align=center 231.17   align=center −4.76     diminished third   10   226.41   256:225   223.46     2.95     whole tone , major tone   9   203.77   9:8   203.91   −0.14     whole tone, minor tone   8   181.13   10:9   182.40   −1.27     align=center neutral second , greater undecimal   align=center 7   align=center 158.49   align=center 11:10   align=center 165.00   align=center −6.51     neutral second , grave whole tone   7   158.49   800:729   160.90   −2.41     align=center neutral second , lesser undecimal   align=center 7   align=center 158.49   align=center 12:11   align=center 150.64   align=center +7.85     neutral second, large limma   6   135.85   27:25   133.24     2.61     Pythagorean major semitone   5   113.21   2187:2048   113.69   −0.48     just diatonic semitone   5   113.21   16:15   111.73     1.48     major limma   4   90.57   135:128   92.18   −1.61     Pythagorean minor semitone   4   90.57   256:243   90.22     0.34     just chromatic semitone   3   67.92   25:24   70.67   −2.75     just diesis   2   45.28   128:125   41.06     4.22     syntonic comma   1   22.64   81:80   21.51     1.14     Theoretical properties  The 53-ET tuning equates to the unison, or tempers out , the intervals 32805/32768, known as the schisma , and 15625/15552, known as the kleisma . These are both 5-limit intervals, involving only the primes 2, 3 and 5 in their factorization, and the fact that 53-ET tempers out both characterizes it completely as a 5-limit temperament: it is the only regular temperament tempering out both of these intervals, or commas , a fact which seems to have first been recognized by Japanese music theorist Shohé Tanaka . Because it tempers these out, 53-ET can be used for both schismatic temperament , tempering out the schisma, and Hanson temperament (also called kleismic), tempering out the kleisma.  The interval of 7/4 is 4.8 cents sharp in 53-ET, and using it for 7-limit harmony means that the septimal kleisma , the interval 225/224, is also tempered out.  Notation  Attempting to use standard notation, seven letter notes plus sharps or flats, can quickly become confusing. This is unlike the case with 19-ET and 31-ET where there is little ambiguity. By not being meantone, it adds some problems that require more attention. Specifically, the major third is different from a ditone, two tones, each of which is two fifths minus an octave. Likewise, the minor third is different from a semiditone. The fact that the syntonic comma is not tempered out means that notes and intervals need to be defined more precisely.  Chords of 53 equal temperament  Standard musical notation can be used to denote 53 equal temperament; however, since it is a Pythagorean system, with nearly pure fifths, major and minor triads cannot be spelled in the same manner as in a meantone tuning. Instead, the major triads are chords like C-F-G, where the major third is a diminished fourth; this is the defining characteristic of schismatic temperament . Likewise, the minor triads are chords like C-D-G. In 53-ET the dominant seventh chord would be spelled C-F-G-B, but the otonal tetrad is C-F-G-C, and C-F-G-A is still another seventh chord. The utonal tetrad, the inversion of the otonal tetrad, is spelled C-D-G-G.  Further septimal chords are the diminished triad, having the two forms C-D-G and C-F-G, the subminor triad, C-F-G, the supermajor triad C-D-G, and corresponding tetrads C-F-G-B and C-D-G-A. Since 53-ET tempers out the septimal kleisma , the septimal kleisma augmented triad C-F-B in its various inversions is also a chord of the system. So is the orwell tetrad, C-F-D-G in its various inversions.  Because 53-TET is compatible with both the schismatic temperament and the syntonic temperament , it can be used as a pivot tuning in a temperament modulation (a musical effect enabled by dynamic tonality ).  Music  In the 19th century, people began devising instruments in 53-et, with an eye to their use in playing near-just 5-limit music. Such instruments were devised by RHM Bosanquet 6 and the American tuner James Paul White . 7 Subsequently the temperament has seen occasional use by composers in the west, and has been used in Turkish music as well; the Turkish composer Erol Sayan has employed it, following theoretical use of it by Turkish music theorist Kemal Ilerici . Arabic music , which for the most part bases its theory on quartertones , has also made some use of it; the Syrian violinist and music theorist Twfiq Al-Sabagh proposed that instead of an equal division of the octave into 24 parts a 24-note scale in 53-et should be used as the master scale for Arabic music.  Croatian composer Josip Štolcer-Slavenski wrote one piece, which has never been published, which uses Bosanquet's Enharmonium during its first movement, entitled Music for Natur-ton-system . 8 9 Furthermore, General Thompson worked in league with the London-based guitar maker Louis Panormo to produce the Enharmonic Guitar (see: James Westbrook,‘General Thompson’s Enharmonic Guitar’, Soundboard: XXXVIII: 4, pp. 45–52.).
