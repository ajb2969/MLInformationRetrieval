   Protein-glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine glucosidase      Protein-glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine glucosidase   In enzymology , a protein-glucosylgalactosylhydroxylysine glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   protein alpha-D-glucosyl-1,2-beta-D-galactosyl-L-hydroxylysine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + protein beta-D-galactosyl-L-hydroxylysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are protein alpha-D-glucosyl-1,2-beta-D-galactosyl-L-hydroxylysine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-glucose and protein beta-D-galactosyl-L-hydroxylysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is protein-alpha-D-glucosyl-1,2-beta-D-galactosyl-L-hydroxylysine glucohydrolase . Other names in common use include 2-O-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl-5-O-alpha-D-galactopyranosylhydroxy-L- , and lysine glucohydrolase .
