Phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase




Phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase

Phosphomethylpyrimidine synthase (, thiC (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole formate-lyase (decarboxylating, 4-amino-2-methyl-5-phosphomethylpyrimidine-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole + S-adenosyl-L-methionine

 
  4-amino-2-methyl-5-phosphomethylpyrimidine + 5'-deoxyadenosine + L-methionine + formate + CO
 

This enzyme binds a 4Fe-4S cluster.
