   Good prime      Good prime   A good prime is a prime number whose square is greater than the product of any two primes at the same number of positions before and after it in the sequence of primes.  A good prime satisfies the inequality       p  n  2   >    p   (   n  -  i   )    ⋅   p   (   n  +  i   )          superscript   subscript  p  n   2    normal-⋅   subscript  p    n  i     subscript  p    n  i       p_{n}^{2}>p_{(n-i)}\cdot p_{(n+i)}     for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n −1. p n is the n th prime.  Example: The first primes are 2, 3, 5, 7 and 11. As for 5 both possible conditions       5  2   >   3  ⋅  7        superscript  5  2    normal-⋅  3  7     5^{2}>3\cdot 7          5  2   >   2  ⋅  11        superscript  5  2    normal-⋅  2  11     5^{2}>2\cdot 11   are fulfilled, 5 is a good prime.  There are infinitely many good primes. 1 The first good primes are   5 , 11 , 17 , 29 , 37 , 41 , 53 , 59 , 67 , 71 , 97 , 101 , 127 , 149 .
