   Partition topology      Partition topology   In mathematics , the partition topology is a topology that can be induced on any set X by partitioning  X into disjoint subsets P ; these subsets form the basis for the topology. There are two important examples which have their own names:   The odd–even topology is the topology where    X  =  ℕ      X  ℕ    X=\mathbb{N}   and    P  =   {   {  2  k  -  1  ,  2  k  }   ,  k  ∈  ℕ  }   .     fragments  P    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-{  2  k   1  normal-,  2  k  normal-}   normal-,  k   N  normal-}   normal-.    P={\left\{\{2k-1,2k\},k\in\mathbb{N}\right\}}.     The '''deleted integer topology ''' is defined by letting    X  =        ⋃   n  ∈  ℕ     (   n  -  1   ,  n  )    ⊂  ℝ          X        subscript     n  ℕ       n  1   n    ℝ       X=\begin{matrix}\bigcup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}(n-1,n)\subset\mathbb{R}\end{matrix}   and    P  =   {   (  0  ,  1  )   ,   (  1  ,  2  )   ,   (  2  ,  3  )   ,  …  }       P    0  1    1  2    2  3   normal-…     P={\left\{(0,1),(1,2),(2,3),\dots\right\}}   .   The trivial partitions yield the discrete topology (each point of X is a set in P ) or indiscrete topology (    P  =   {  X  }       P   X     P=\{X\}   ).  Any set X with a partition topology generated by a partition P can be viewed as a pseudometric space with a pseudometric given by:       d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   {     0     if  x  and  y  are in the same partition       1     otherwise  ,             d   x  y     cases  0    if  x  and  y  are in the same partition   1  otherwise     d(x,y)=\begin{cases}0&\text{if }x\text{ and }y\text{ are in the same partition%
 }\\
 1&\text{otherwise},\end{cases}     This is not a metric unless P yields the discrete topology.  The partition topology provides an important example of the independence of various separation axioms . Unless P is trivial, at least one set in P contains more than one point, and the elements of this set are topologically indistinguishable : the topology does not separate points. Hence X is not a Kolmogorov space , nor a T 1 space , a Hausdorff space or an Urysohn space . In a partition topology the complement of every open set is also open, and therefore a set is open if and only if it is closed. Therefore, X is a regular , completely regular , normal and completely normal .  We note also that X/P is the discrete topology.  References     "  Category:Topological spaces
