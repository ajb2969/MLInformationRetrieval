   Arden Buck equation      Arden Buck equation   The Arden Buck equations are a group of empirical correlations that relate the saturation vapor pressure to temperature for moist air . The curve fits have been optimized for more accuracy than the Goff–Gratch equation in the range −80 to 50°C. 1  A set of several equations were developed, each of which is applicable in a different situation.  Formula  The equation suggested by  (which is a modification of the equation in ) is:        P  s    (  T  )    =   6.1121   exp   (    (   18.678  -   T  234.5    )    (   T   257.14  +  T    )    )            subscript  P  s   T     6.1121        18.678    T  234.5      T    257.14  T         P_{s}\left(T\right)=6.1121\exp\left(\left(18.678-\frac{T}{234.5}\right)\left(%
