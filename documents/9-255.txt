Arden Buck equation

The Arden Buck equations are a group of empirical correlations that relate the saturation vapor pressure to temperature for moist air. The curve fits have been optimized for more accuracy than the Goff–Gratch equation in the range −80 to 50°C.1
A set of several equations were developed, each of which is applicable in a different situation.
Formula
The equation suggested by  (which is a modification of the equation in ) is:



where:

Ps(T) is the saturation vapor pressure in hPa
exp is the natural (i.e. base e) exponential function
T is the air temperature in degrees Celsius
