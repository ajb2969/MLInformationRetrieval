   L-3-cyanoalanine synthase      L-3-cyanoalanine synthase   In enzymology , a L-3-cyanoalanine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-cysteine + hydrogen cyanide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-3-cyanoalanine + hydrogen sulfide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-cysteine and hydrogen cyanide , whereas its two products are L-3-cyanoalanine and hydrogen sulfide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cysteine hydrogen-sulfide-lyase (adding hydrogen cyanide L-3-cyanoalanine-forming) . Other names in common use include beta-cyanoalanine synthase , beta-cyanoalanine synthetase , beta-cyano-L-alanine synthase , and L-cysteine hydrogen-sulfide-lyase (adding HCN) . This enzyme participates in cyanoamino acid metabolism .  References        "  Category:EC 4.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
