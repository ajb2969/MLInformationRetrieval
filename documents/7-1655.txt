Graph state

In quantum computing, a graph state is a special type of multi-qubit state that can be represented by a graph. Each qubit is represented by a vertex of the graph, and there is an edge between every interacting pair of qubits. In particular, they are a convenient way of representing certain types of entangled states.
Graph states are useful in quantum error-correcting codes, entanglement measurement and purification and for characterization of computational resources in measurement based quantum computing models.
Formal definition
Given a graph G = (V, E), with the set of vertices V and the set of edges E, the corresponding graph state is defined as



where the operator 
 
 
 
  is the controlled-Z interaction between the two vertices (qubits) a, b



And



Alternative definition
An alternative and equivalent definition is the following.
Define an operator 
 
 
 
  for each vertex a of G:



where N(a) is the neighborhood of a (that is, the set of all b such that 
 
 
 
 ) and 
 
 
 
  are the pauli matrices. The graph state 
 
 
 
  is then defined as the simultaneous eigenstate of the 
 
 
 
  operators 
 
 
 
  with eigenvalue 1:
