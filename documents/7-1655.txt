   Graph state      Graph state   In quantum computing , a graph state is a special type of multi- qubit state that can be represented by a graph . Each qubit is represented by a vertex of the graph, and there is an edge between every interacting pair of qubits. In particular, they are a convenient way of representing certain types of entangled states.  Graph states are useful in quantum error-correcting codes , entanglement measurement and purification and for characterization of computational resources in measurement based quantum computing models.  Formal definition  Given a graph G = ( V , E ), with the set of vertices  V and the set of edges  E , the corresponding graph state is defined as       |  G  ⟩   =    ∏    (  a  ,  b  )   ∈  E      U   {  a  ,  b  }      |  +  ⟩     ⊗  V           ket  G     subscript  product     a  b   E       superscript  U   a  b     superscript   ket     tensor-product  absent  V        {\left|G\right\rangle}=\prod_{(a,b)\in E}U^{\{a,b\}}{\left|+\right\rangle}^{%
 \otimes V}     where the operator    U   {  a  ,  b  }      superscript  U   a  b     U^{\{a,b\}}   is the controlled- Z interaction between the two vertices (qubits) a , b       U   {  a  ,  b  }    =   [     1    0    0    0      0    1    0    0      0    0    1    0      0    0    0     -  1      ]        superscript  U   a  b     delimited-[]    1  0  0  0    0  1  0  0    0  0  1  0    0  0  0    1        U^{\{a,b\}}=\left[\begin{array}[]{cccc}{1}&{0}&{0}&{0}\\
 {0}&{1}&{0}&{0}\\
 {0}&{0}&{1}&{0}\\
 {0}&{0}&{0}&{-1}\end{array}\right]     And       |  +  ⟩   =     |  0  ⟩   +   |  1  ⟩     2         ket         ket  0    ket  1      2      {\left|+\right\rangle}=\frac{{\left|0\right\rangle}+{\left|1\right\rangle}}{%
 \sqrt{2}}     Alternative definition  An alternative and equivalent definition is the following.  Define an operator    K  G   (  a  )      superscript   subscript  K  G   a    K_{G}^{(a)}   for each vertex a of G :       K  G   (  a  )    =    σ  x   (  a  )      ∏   b  ∈   N   (  a  )       σ  z   (  b  )           superscript   subscript  K  G   a      superscript   subscript  σ  x   a     subscript  product    b    N  a      superscript   subscript  σ  z   b       K_{G}^{(a)}=\sigma_{x}^{(a)}\prod_{b\in N(a)}\sigma_{z}^{(b)}     where N ( a ) is the neighborhood of a (that is, the set of all b such that     (  a  ,  b  )   ∈  E       a  b   E    (a,b)\in E   ) and    σ   x  ,  y  ,  z      subscript  σ   x  y  z     \sigma_{x,y,z}   are the pauli matrices . The graph state    |  G  ⟩     ket  G    {\left|G\right\rangle}   is then defined as the simultaneous eigenstate of the    N  =   |  V  |       N    V     N=\left|V\right|   operators     {   K  G   (  a  )    }    a  ∈  V      subscript    superscript   subscript  K  G   a      a  V     \left\{K_{G}^{(a)}\right\}_{a\in V}   with eigenvalue 1:        K  G   (  a  )     |  G  ⟩    =   |  G  ⟩          superscript   subscript  K  G   a    ket  G     ket  G     K_{G}^{(a)}{\left|G\right\rangle}={\left|G\right\rangle}     See also   Entanglement  Cluster state   References     [ http://xstructure.inr.ac.ru/x-bin/theme3.py?level=1&index1; ;=423009 Graph states on arxiv.org]   "  Category:Quantum information science
