   Artstein's theorem      Artstein's theorem   Artstein's theorem states that a dynamical system has a differentiable control-Lyapunov function if and only if there exists a regular stabilizing feedback    u   (  x  )       u  x    u(x)   . 1  See also   Dynamical system (definition)  Dynamical systems theory   References  "  Category:Control theory  Category:Theorems in dynamical systems     Sontag, Eduardo D.
