   Malate dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Malate dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a malate dehydrogenase (NADP + ) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-malate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloacetate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are oxaloacetate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:NADP + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADP + -malic enzyme , NADP + -malate dehydrogenase , malic dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) , malate NADP + dehydrogenase , NADP + malate dehydrogenase , NADP + -linked malate dehydrogenase , and malate dehydrogenase (NADP + ) . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and carbon fixation . This enzyme has at least one effector , hn.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
