Precorrin-3B C17-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a precorrin-3B C17-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-3B 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-4
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and precorrin 3B, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and precorrin 4.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-3B C17-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include precorrin-3 methyltransferase, and CobJ. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
