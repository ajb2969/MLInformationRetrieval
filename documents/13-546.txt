   Microrheology      Microrheology   Microrheology 1 is a technique used to measure the rheological properties of a medium, such as microviscosity , via the measurement of the trajectory of a flow tracer (a micrometre -sized particle). It is a new way of doing rheology , traditionally done using a rheometer . There are two types of microrheology: passive microrheology and active microrheology . Passive microrheology uses inherent thermal energy to move the tracers, whereas active microrheology uses externally applied forces, such as from a magnetic field or an optical tweezer , to do so. Microrheology can be further differentiated into 1- and 2-particle methods. 2  3  Passive microrheology  '' Passive microrheology '' uses the thermal energy ( kT ) to move the tracers, although recent evidence suggest that active random forces inside cells may instead move the tracers in a diffusive-like manner. 4 The trajectories of the tracers are measured optically either by microscopy or by diffusing-wave spectroscopy (DWS). From the mean squared displacement with respect to time (noted MSD or 2> ), one can calculate the visco-elastic moduli G ′( ω ) and G ″( ω ) using the generalized Stokes–Einstein relation (GSER). Here is a view of the trajectory of a particle of micrometer size.

If the tracers are having a free diffusion, one can deduce that the medium is purely viscous. If the tracers are having a sub-diffusive mean trajectory, it indicates that the medium presents some viscoelastic properties. For example, in a polymer network, the tracer may be trapped. The excursion δ of the tracer is related to the elastic modulus G ′ with the relation G ′ = k B T /(6 πaδ 2 ). 5  Microrheology is another way to do linear rheology. Since the force involved is very weak (order of 10 −15 N), microrheology is guaranteed to be in the so-called linear region of the strain/stress relationship. It is also able to measure very small volumes (biological cell).  Given the complex viscoelastic modulus     G   (  ω  )    =     G  ′    (  ω  )    +   i   G  ′′    (  ω  )           G  ω        superscript  G  normal-′   ω     i   superscript  G  ′′   ω      G(\omega)=G^{\prime}(\omega)+iG^{\prime\prime}(\omega)\,   with G ′( ω ) the elastic (conservative) part and G ″( ω ) the viscous (dissipative) part and ω =2 πf the pulsation. The GSER is as follows:        G  ~    (  s  )    =     k  B   T    π  a  s   ⟨   Δ    r  ~   2    (  s  )    ⟩            normal-~  G   s        subscript  k  normal-B   T     π  a  s   delimited-⟨⟩    normal-Δ   superscript   normal-~  r   2   s        \tilde{G}(s)=\frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}T}{\pi as\langle\Delta\tilde{r}^{2}(s)\rangle}     with       G  ~    (  s  )        normal-~  G   s    \tilde{G}(s)   : Laplace transform of G   k B : Boltzmann constant  T : temperature in kelvins  s : the Laplace frequency  a : the radius of the tracer      ⟨   Δ    r  ~   2    (  s  )    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩    normal-Δ   superscript   normal-~  r   2   s     \langle\Delta\tilde{r}^{2}(s)\rangle   : the Laplace transform of the mean squared displacement   A related method of passive microrheology involves the tracking positions of a particle at a high frequency, often with a quadrant photodiode. 6 From the position,    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   , the power spectrum,    α   (  ω  )       α  ω    \alpha(\omega)   can be found, and then related to the real and imaginary parts of the response function,    G   (  ω  )       G  ω    G(\omega)   . 7 The response function leads directly to a calculation of the complex shear modulus,     G   (  ω  )    =   1   6  π  a  α   (  ω  )           G  ω     1    6  π  a  α  ω      G(\omega)=\frac{1}{6\pi a\alpha(\omega)}   via:  $$G(\omega) = \frac{1}{6 \pi a \alpha(\omega)}$$  Active microrheology  Active microrheology may use a magnetic field 8 9 10 11 12 or optical tweezers 13 14 15 to apply a force on the tracer and then find the stress/strain relation. More recently, it has been developed into Force spectrum microscopy to measure contributions of random active motor proteins to diffusive motion in the cytoskeleton . 16  References  External links   Harvard Weitz Lab page  [ http://www.rsc.org/delivery/_ArticleLinking/DisplayHTMLArticleforfree.cfm?JournalCode=LC&Year; ;=2009&ManuscriptID;=b907992k&Iss;=17 Review of microrheology in optical tweezers]  Review on microrheology  Illustrated description of microrheology and a microrheology analysis, with movies  Microrheology Overview with Animations   "  Category:Rheology  Category:Soft matter     ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
