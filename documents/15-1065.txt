   Benzoyl-CoA 2,3-dioxygenase      Benzoyl-CoA 2,3-dioxygenase   Benzoyl-CoA 2,3-dioxygenase (, benzoyl-CoA dioxygenase/reductase , BoxBA , BoxA/BoxB system ) is an enzyme with system name benzoyl-CoA,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (2,3-hydroxylating) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   benzoyl-CoA + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,3-dihydro-2,3-dihydroxybenzoyl-CoA + NADP +    Benzoyl-CoA 2,3-dioxygenase is involved in aerobic benzoate metabolism in Azoarcus evansii .
