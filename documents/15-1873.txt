N-acetyl-1-D-myo-inositol-2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside deacetylase

N-acetyl-1-D-myo-inositol-2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside deacetylase (, MshB) is an enzyme with system name 1-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-1D-myo-inositol acetylhydrolase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1-(2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-1D-myo-inositol + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-(2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranoside)-1D-myo-inositol + acetate


This enzyme mediates the rate limiting step in the mycothiol biosynthesis pathway.
