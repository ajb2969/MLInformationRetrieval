   Flat function      Flat function   In mathematics , especially real analysis , a flat function is a smooth function ƒ : ℝ → ℝ all of whose derivatives vanish at a given point x 0 ∈ ℝ. The flat functions are, in some sense, the antitheses of the analytic functions . An analytic function ƒ : ℝ → ℝ is given by a convergent  power series close to some point x 0 ∈ ℝ:        f   (  x  )    ∼    lim   n  →  ∞      ∑   k  =  0   n       f   (  k  )     (   x  0   )     k  !      (   x  -   x  0    )   k       .     similar-to    f  x     subscript    normal-→  n       superscript   subscript     k  0    n          superscript  f  k    subscript  x  0      k     superscript    x   subscript  x  0    k        f(x)\sim\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{f^{(k)}(x_{0})}{k!}(x-x_{0})^{k}.   In the case of a flat function we see that all derivatives vanish at x 0 ∈ ℝ, i.e. ƒ ( k ) ( x 0 ) = 0 for all k ∈ ℕ. This means that a meaningful Taylor series expansion in a neighbourhood of x 0 is impossible. In the language of Taylor's theorem , the non-constant part of the function always lies in the remainder R n ( x ) for all n ∈ ℕ.  Notice that the function need not be flat everywhere. The constant functions on ℝ are flat functions at all of their points. But there are other, non-trivial, examples.  Example  The function defined by       f   (  x  )    =   {      e   -   1  /   x  2          if  x   ≠  0       0      if  x   =  0             f  x    cases   superscript  e      1   superscript  x  2          if  x   0   0      if  x   0      f(x)=\begin{cases}e^{-1/x^{2}}&\text{if }x\neq 0\\
 0&\text{if }x=0\end{cases}     is flat at x = 0.  References     "  Category:Real analysis  Category:Algebraic geometry  Category:Differential calculus  Category:Smooth functions  Category:Differential structures
