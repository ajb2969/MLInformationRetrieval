   Lemniscatic elliptic function      Lemniscatic elliptic function   In mathematics , a lemniscatic elliptic function is an elliptic function related to the arc length of a lemniscate of Bernoulli studied by Giulio Carlo de' Toschi di Fagnano in 1718. It has a square period lattice and is closely related to the Weierstrass elliptic function when the Weierstrass invariants satisfy g 2 = 1 and g 3 = 0.  In the lemniscatic case, the minimal half period ω 1 is real and equal to        Γ  2    (   1  4   )     4   π           superscript  normal-Γ  2     1  4      4    π      \frac{\Gamma^{2}(\tfrac{1}{4})}{4\sqrt{\pi}}     where Γ is the Gamma function . The second smallest half period is pure imaginary and equal to i ω 1 . In more algebraic terms, the period lattice is a real multiple of the Gaussian integers .  The constants ''e ''1 , ''e ''2 , and ''e ''3 are given by         e  1   =    1  2     ,     e  2   =  0   ,    e  3   =   -    1  2        .     formulae-sequence     subscript  e  1     1  2     formulae-sequence     subscript  e  2   0      subscript  e  3       1  2        e_{1}=\tfrac{1}{2},\qquad e_{2}=0,\qquad e_{3}=-\tfrac{1}{2}.     The case g 2 = a , g 3 = 0 may be handled by a scaling transformation. However, this may involve complex numbers. If it is desired to remain within real numbers, there are two cases to consider: a > 0 and a \operatorname{sl}(r)=s where      r  =    ∫  0  s     d  t     1  -   t  4           r    superscript   subscript   0   s       d  t       1   superscript  t  4         r=\int_{0}^{s}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{1-t^{4}}}   and       cl   (  r  )    =  c       cl  r   c    \operatorname{cl}(r)=c          r  =    ∫  c  1     d  t     1  -   t  4        .      r    superscript   subscript   c   1       d  t       1   superscript  t  4         r=\int_{c}^{1}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{1-t^{4}}}.   They are doubly periodic (or elliptic) functions in the complex plane, with periods 2π G and 2π iG , where Gauss's constant  G is given by       G  =    2  π     ∫  0  1     d  t     1  -   t  4        =   0.8346  …    .        G      2  π     superscript   subscript   0   1       d  t       1   superscript  t  4               0.8346  normal-…      G=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{1}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{1-t^{4}}}=0.8346\ldots.     Arclength of lemniscate  The lemniscate of Bernoulli        (    x  2   +   y  2    )   2   =    x  2   -   y  2         superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    2      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      (x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}=x^{2}-y^{2}   consists of the points such that the product of their distances from two the two points (1/√2, 0), (−1/√2, 0) is the constant 1/2. The length r of the arc from the origin to a point at distance s from the origin is given by       r  =    ∫  0  s     d  t     1  -   t  4        .      r    superscript   subscript   0   s       d  t       1   superscript  t  4         r=\int_{0}^{s}\frac{dt}{\sqrt{1-t^{4}}}.   In other words, the sine lemniscatic function gives the distance from the origin as a function of the arc length from the origin. Similarly the cosine lemniscate function gives the distance from the origin as a function of the arc length from (1,0).
