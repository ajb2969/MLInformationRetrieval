Lemniscatic elliptic function

In mathematics, a lemniscatic elliptic function is an elliptic function related to the arc length of a lemniscate of Bernoulli studied by Giulio Carlo de' Toschi di Fagnano in 1718. It has a square period lattice and is closely related to the Weierstrass elliptic function when the Weierstrass invariants satisfy g2 = 1 and g3 = 0.
In the lemniscatic case, the minimal half period ω1 is real and equal to



where Γ is the Gamma function. The second smallest half period is pure imaginary and equal to iω1. In more algebraic terms, the period lattice is a real multiple of the Gaussian integers.
The constants ''e''1, ''e''2, and ''e''3 are given by



The case g2 = a, g3 = 0 may be handled by a scaling transformation. However, this may involve complex numbers. If it is desired to remain within real numbers, there are two cases to consider: a > 0 and a \operatorname{sl}(r)=s where


 
  and





 
  They are doubly periodic (or elliptic) functions in the complex plane, with periods 2πG and 2πiG, where Gauss's constant G is given by



Arclength of lemniscate
 The lemniscate of Bernoulli


 
  consists of the points such that the product of their distances from two the two points (1/√2, 0), (−1/√2, 0) is the constant 1/2. The length r of the arc from the origin to a point at distance s from the origin is given by


 
  In other words, the sine lemniscatic function gives the distance from the origin as a function of the arc length from the origin. Similarly the cosine lemniscate function gives the distance from the origin as a function of the arc length from (1,0).
