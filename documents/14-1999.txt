LEDA 074886

LEDA 074886, also known as PGC 74886, is a dwarf galaxy with a rare rectangular shape, located at a distance of about  in the Eridanus constellation.1 The galaxy was detected in a wide field of view image taken by Subaru Telescope2 using the Subaru Prime Focus Camera (Suprime-Cam).3 The Keck Telescope discovered a rapidly spinning, thin disc with a side on orientation lurking at the center of LEDA 074886.4 It is believed that unless LEDA 074886 merges with a similarly aligned galaxy, it may lose its corners over the next billion years.5 LEDA 074886 has a mass of around 109 M⊙ (Compared to the Milky Way's mass of about 1012 M⊙).6
Location
LEDA 074886 is located in the celestial sphere at an azimuth (
 
 
 
 ) of , and a declination (

SDSS J074018.17+282756.3 is a spiral galaxy with arms that have a somewhat squarish-looking interior, but is distinct from LEDA 074886 because LEDA 074886 has no apparent spiral structure and a boxy like exterior form.8
Sextans A, a member of the local group, has a box like form due to its expanding shell of young blue stars, but it has a much lower mass and density, and includes a central disc which LEDA 074886 does not include.9
