   Hardy hierarchy      Hardy hierarchy   In computability theory , computational complexity theory and proof theory , the Hardy hierarchy , named after G. H. Hardy , is an ordinal-indexed family of functions h α : N → N (where N is the set of natural numbers , {0, 1, ...}). It is related to the fast-growing hierarchy and slow-growing hierarchy . The hierarchy was first described in Hardy's 1904 paper, "A theorem concerning the infinite cardinal numbers".  Definition  Let μ be a large countable ordinal such that a fundamental sequence is assigned to every limit ordinal less than μ. The Hardy hierarchy of functions h α : N → N , for α h_0(n) = n,\,          h   α  +  1     (  n  )    =    h  α    (   n  +  1   )     ,         subscript  h    α  1    n      subscript  h  α     n  1      h_{\alpha+1}(n)=h_{\alpha}(n+1),\,           h  α    (  n  )    =    h   α   [  n  ]      (  n  )           subscript  h  α   n      subscript  h    α   delimited-[]  n     n     h_{\alpha}(n)=h_{\alpha[n]}(n)\,\!   if α is a limit ordinal.   Here α[ n ] denotes the n th element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal α . A standardized choice of fundamental sequence for all α ≤ ε 0 is described in the article on the fast-growing hierarchy .  Caicedo (2007) defines a modified Hardy hierarchy of functions    H  α     subscript  H  α    H_{\alpha}\,\!   by using the standard fundamental sequences, but with α[ n +1] (instead of α[ n ]) in the third line of the above definition.  Relation to fast-growing hierarchy  The Wainer hierarchy of functions f α and the Hardy hierarchy of functions h α are related by f α = h ω α for all α 0. Thus, for any α 0, h α grows much more slowly than does f α . However, the Hardy hierarchy "catches up" to the Wainer hierarchy at α = ε 0 , such that f ε 0 and h ε 0 have the same growth rate, in the sense that f ε 0 ( n -1) ≤ h ε 0 ( n ) ≤ f ε 0 ( n +1) for all n ≥ 1.
