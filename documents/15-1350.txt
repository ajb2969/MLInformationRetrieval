Tetramethylammonium-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase

Tetramethylammonium-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase (, mtqB (gene), tetramethylammonium methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name tetramethylammonium:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

tetramethylammonium + [Co(I) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein] 
 
 
 
  [methyl-Co(III) tetramethylammonium-specific corrinoid protein] + trimethylamine


This enzyme is involved in methanogenesis from tetramethylammonium.
