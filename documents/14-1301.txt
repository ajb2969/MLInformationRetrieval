   Al-Salam–Chihara polynomials      Al-Salam–Chihara polynomials   In mathematics, the Al-Salam–Chihara polynomials  Q n ( x ; a , b ; q ) are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme , introduced by .  give a detailed list of the properties of Al-Salam–Chihara polynomials.  Definition  The Al-Salam–Chihara polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by        Q  n    (  x  ;  a  ,  b  ;  q  )    =      (   a  b   ;  q  )   n    a  n     ϕ  2    3     (   q   -  n    ,   a   e   i  θ     ,   a   e   -   i  θ      ;   a  b   ,  0  ;  q  ,  q  )           subscript  Q  n    x  a  b  q         subscript     a  b   q   n    superscript  a  n     subscript   subscript  ϕ  2   3     superscript  q    n      a   superscript  e    i  θ       a   superscript  e      i  θ        a  b   0  q  q      Q_{n}(x;a,b;q)=\frac{(ab;q)_{n}}{a^{n}}{}_{3}\phi_{2}(q^{-n},ae^{i\theta},ae^{%
