Normal modal logic

In logic, a normal modal logic is a set L of modal formulas such that L contains:

All propositional tautologies;
All instances of the Kripke schema
 
 


and it is closed under:

Detachment rule (Modus Ponens)
 
 
 
 ;
Necessitation rule
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 .

The smallest logic satisfying the above conditions is called K. Most modal logics commonly used nowadays (in terms of having philosophical motivations), e.g. C. I. Lewis's S4 and S5, are extensions of K. However a number of deontic and epistemic logics, for example, are non-normal, often because they give up the Kripke schema.
