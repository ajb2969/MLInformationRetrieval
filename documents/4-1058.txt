   Normal modal logic      Normal modal logic   In logic , a normal modal logic is a set L of modal formulas such that L contains:   All propositional tautologies ;  All instances of the Kripke schema    □   (  A  →  B  )   →   (  □  A  →  □  B  )      fragments  □   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  B  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  □  A  normal-→  □  B  normal-)     \Box(A\to B)\to(\Box A\to\Box B)      and it is closed under:   Detachment rule ( Modus Ponens )     A  →   B  ,  A    ⊢  B     proves   normal-→  A   B  A    B    A\to B,A\vdash B   ;  Necessitation rule     ⊢  A     proves  absent  A    \vdash A   implies     ⊢   □  A      proves  absent    normal-□  A     \vdash\Box A   .   The smallest logic satisfying the above conditions is called K . Most modal logics commonly used nowadays (in terms of having philosophical motivations), e.g. C. I. Lewis 's S4 and S5 , are extensions of K . However a number of deontic and epistemic logics , for example, are non-normal, often because they give up the Kripke schema.  "  Category:Modal logic
