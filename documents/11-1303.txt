Levansucrase




Levansucrase

Levansucrase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sucrose + (2,6-beta-D-fructosyl)n 
 
 
 
  glucose + (2,6-beta-D-fructosyl)n+1
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sucrose and (2,6-beta-D-fructosyl)n, whereas its two products are glucose and (2,6-beta-D-fructosyl)n+1.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sucrose:2,6-beta-D-fructan 6-beta-D-fructosyltransferase. Other names in common use include sucrose 6-fructosyltransferase, beta-2,6-fructosyltransferase, and beta-2,6-fructan:D-glucose 1-fructosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism and two-component system - general.
