Surface energy transfer

 Surface energy transfer (SET) is a dipole-surface energy transfer process involving metallic surface and molecular dipole.1 SET rate follows an inverse of fourth power of distance.2


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the donor emission lifetime, 
 
 
 
  is the distance between donor-acceptor and 
 
 
 
  is the distance at which SET efficiency decreases to 50% (i.e., equal probability of energy transfer and spontaneous emission).
The energy transfer efficiency also follows a similar form



Due to the fourth power dependence SET can cover a distance more than 15 nm, which is almost twice the efficiency of FRET.3 Theoretically predicted in 1978 by Chance et al. it was proved experimentally in 2000s by different workers.4 Efficiency of SET as nanoruler is also found to be successful in live cell.5 Gold nano particle is frequently used in these studies as nanoparticle surface.
