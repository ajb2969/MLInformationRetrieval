   Surface energy transfer      Surface energy transfer    Surface energy transfer (SET) is a dipole -surface energy transfer process involving metallic surface and molecular dipole. 1 SET rate follows an inverse of fourth power of distance. 2       k   S  E  T    =    (   1  /   τ  D    )     (   d  /   d  0    )   4         subscript  k    S  E  T        1   subscript  τ  D     superscript    d   subscript  d  0    4      k_{SET}=({{1}/{\tau_{D}})({d}/{d_{0}})^{4}}   where    τ  D     subscript  τ  D    \tau_{D}   is the donor emission lifetime,   d   d   d   is the distance between donor-acceptor and    d  0     subscript  d  0    d_{0}   is the distance at which SET efficiency decreases to 50% (i.e., equal probability of energy transfer and spontaneous emission ).  The energy transfer efficiency also follows a similar form       ϕ   S  E  T    =   1   1  +    (   d  /   d  0    )   4          subscript  ϕ    S  E  T      1    1   superscript    d   subscript  d  0    4       \phi_{SET}=\frac{1}{1+({d}/{d_{0}})^{4}}     Due to the fourth power dependence SET can cover a distance more than 15 nm , which is almost twice the efficiency of FRET . 3 Theoretically predicted in 1978 by Chance et al. it was proved experimentally in 2000s by different workers. 4 Efficiency of SET as nanoruler is also found to be successful in live cell. 5  Gold nano particle is frequently used in these studies as nanoparticle surface.
