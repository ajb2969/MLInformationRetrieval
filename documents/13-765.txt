   Catchment hydrology      Catchment hydrology   Catchment hydrology , is the study of the hydrology in drainage basins .  Water balance  ''Main article: Water balance Catchment hydrology is based on the principal of continuity, which is used to perform a water balance on a catchment:       I  -  O   =     d  S   /  d   t         I  O         d  S   d   t     I-O=dS/dt   ,  where   I   I   I   = inputs (P, precipitation + OW, occult water ),   O   O   O   = outputs (ET, evapotranspiration + R, runoff ), and      d  S   /  d   t          d  S   d   t    dS/dt   = the change in catchment storage over time.  Neglecting the minor inputs of occult water, the water balance can be revised to       P  -  R  -   E  T    =     d  S   /  d   t         P  R    E  T          d  S   d   t     P-R-ET=dS/dt   .  Finally, considering a catchment on a long time scale, typically a year or more, removes the storage component from the equation:       P  -  R   =   E  T         P  R     E  T     P-R=ET   . 1  (For more information see water balance )  Terminology  There are many terms involved with and related to catchment hydrology. These basic ones are taken from the glossary of terms in Kendall and McDonnell, 1998:   aquifer  baseflow  catchment  drainage divide  evaporation  evapotranspiration  event water  groundwater flow  Horton flow  hydrograph  infiltration  intensity  interception  overland flow  pre-event water  subsurface runoff  subsurface stormflow  surface runoff  time of concentration  transpiration   References  See also   hydrology  isotope hydrology  hydrogeology  groundwater  agricultural hydrology   "  Category:Hydrology     Kendall and McDonnell, 1998.
