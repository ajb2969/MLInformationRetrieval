Catchment hydrology

Catchment hydrology, is the study of the hydrology in drainage basins.
Water balance
''Main article:Water balance Catchment hydrology is based on the principal of continuity, which is used to perform a water balance on a catchment:


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  = inputs (P, precipitation + OW, occult water), 
 
 
 
  = outputs (ET, evapotranspiration + R, runoff), and 
 
 
 
  = the change in catchment storage over time.
Neglecting the minor inputs of occult water, the water balance can be revised to


 
 .
Finally, considering a catchment on a long time scale, typically a year or more, removes the storage component from the equation:

Terminology
There are many terms involved with and related to catchment hydrology. These basic ones are taken from the glossary of terms in Kendall and McDonnell, 1998:

aquifer
baseflow
catchment
drainage divide
evaporation
evapotranspiration
event water
groundwater flow
Horton flow
hydrograph
infiltration
intensity
interception
overland flow
pre-event water
subsurface runoff
subsurface stormflow
surface runoff
time of concentration
transpiration
