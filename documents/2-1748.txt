   D'Alembert operator      D'Alembert operator   In special relativity , electromagnetism and wave theory , the d'Alembert operator (represented by a box   □   normal-□   \Box   ), also called the d'Alembertian or the wave operator , is the Laplace operator of Minkowski space . The operator is named after French mathematician and physicist Jean le Rond d'Alembert . In Minkowski space in standard coordinates ( t , x , y , z ) it has the form:     □   normal-□   \displaystyle\Box     Here    ∇  2     superscript  normal-∇  2    \nabla^{2}   is the 3-dimensional Laplacian and    g   μ  ν      superscript  g    μ  ν     g^{\mu\nu}   is the inverse Minkowski metric with      g  00    =  1       subscript  g  00   1    g_{00}\,=\,1   ,      g  11    =    g  22    =    g  33    =   -  1          subscript  g  11    subscript  g  22         subscript  g  33          1      g_{11}\,=\,g_{22}\,=\,g_{33}\,=\,-1   ,      g   μ  ν     =  0       subscript  g    μ  ν    0    g_{\mu\nu}\,=\,0   for     μ   ≠  ν      μ  ν    \mu\,\neq\,\nu   . Note that the μ and ν summation indices range from 0 to 3: see Einstein notation . We have assumed units such that the speed of light     c   =  1      c  1    c\,=\,1   . Some authors also use the negative metric signature of [− + + +] with       g  00    =   -  1    ,     g  11    =    g  22    =    g  33    =  1      formulae-sequence     subscript  g  00     1         subscript  g  11    subscript  g  22         subscript  g  33        1      g_{00}\,=\,-1,\;g_{11}\,=\,g_{22}\,=\,g_{33}\,=\,1   .  Lorentz transformations leave the Minkowski metric invariant, so the d'Alembertian is a Lorentz scalar . The above coordinate expressions remain valid for the standard coordinates in every inertial frame.  Alternate notations  There are a variety of notations for the d'Alembertian. The most common is the symbol   □   normal-□   \scriptstyle\Box   ( Unicode : ): the four sides of the box representing the four dimensions of space-time and the    □  2     superscript  normal-□  2    \scriptstyle\Box^{2}   which emphasizes the scalar property through the squared term (much like the Laplacian ). This symbol is sometimes called the quabla ( cf . nabla symbol ). In keeping with the triangular notation for the Laplacian sometimes    Δ  M     subscript  normal-Δ  M    \scriptstyle\Delta_{M}   is used.  Another way to write the d'Alembertian in flat standard coordinates is    ∂  2     superscript   2    \scriptstyle\partial^{2}   . This notation is used extensively in quantum field theory where partial derivatives are usually indexed: so the lack of an index with the squared partial derivative signals the presence of the D'Alembertian.  Sometimes   □   normal-□   \scriptstyle\Box   is used to represent the four-dimensional Levi-Civita covariant derivative . The symbol   ∇   normal-∇   \scriptstyle\nabla   is then used to represent the space derivatives, but this is coordinate chart dependent.  Applications  The wave equation for small vibrations is of the form         □  c   u   (  x  ,  t  )    ≡    u   t  t    -    c  2    u   x  x      =  0   ,           subscript  normal-□  c   u   x  t       subscript  u    t  t       superscript  c  2    subscript  u    x  x           0     \Box_{c}u\left(x,t\right)\equiv u_{tt}-c^{2}u_{xx}=0,\,      where    u   (  x  ,  t  )       u   x  t     \scriptstyle u\left(x,t\right)   is the displacement.   The wave equation for the electromagnetic field in vacuum is       □   A  μ    =  0        normal-□   superscript  A  μ    0    \Box A^{\mu}=0      where    A  μ     superscript  A  μ    A^{\mu}   is the electromagnetic four-potential .   The Klein–Gordon equation has the form        (   □  +   m  2    )   ψ   =   0.           normal-□   superscript  m  2    ψ   0.    (\Box+m^{2})\psi=0.\,     Green's function  The Green's function     G   (   x  -   x  ′    )       G    x   superscript  x  normal-′      \scriptstyle G(x-x^{\prime})   for the d'Alembertian is defined by the equation       □  G   (    x  ~   -    x  ~   ′    )    =   δ   (    x  ~   -    x  ~   ′    )          normal-□  G     normal-~  x    superscript   normal-~  x   normal-′       δ     normal-~  x    superscript   normal-~  x   normal-′       \Box G\left(\tilde{x}-\tilde{x}^{\prime}\right)=\delta\left(\tilde{x}-\tilde{x%
 }^{\prime}\right)     where    δ   (    x  ~   -    x  ~   ′    )       δ     normal-~  x    superscript   normal-~  x   normal-′      \scriptstyle\delta(\tilde{x}-\tilde{x}^{\prime})   is the multidimensional Dirac delta function and    x  ~     normal-~  x    \scriptstyle\tilde{x}   and     x  ~   ′     superscript   normal-~  x   normal-′    \scriptstyle\tilde{x}^{\prime}   are two points in Minkowski space.  A special solution is given by the retarded Green's function which corresponds to signal propagation only forward in time       G   (   r  →   ,  t  )    =    1   4  π  r    Θ   (  t  )   δ   (   t  -   r  c    )          G    normal-→  r   t        1    4  π  r    normal-Θ  t  δ    t    r  c       G(\vec{r},t)=\frac{1}{4\pi r}\Theta(t)\delta\left(t-\frac{r}{c}\right)    1  where    Θ    normal-Θ   \scriptstyle\,\Theta   is the Heaviside step function .
