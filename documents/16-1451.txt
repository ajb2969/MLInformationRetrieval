Draft:Hydraulic relationships triangular and parabolic open channels



According to the Bernoulli principle, the energy posed by an incompressible fluid is the sum of the pressure head, the velocity head and the elevation head. Assuming water to be a perfectly incompressible fluid, the total energy of water in a channel can be expressed mathematically as,
$$H=\frac{p}{\gamma}+\frac{v^2}{2g}+z$$ (1)

Where,
 :H=Total head(L)
 :p=Pressure(F/L2)
 :g=Acceleration due to gravitaty(L/T2)
 :v=velocity of flow (L/T)
 :z=elevation of water surface level above the datum(L)


The flow of water through the channel results in loss of energy due to friction resulting from channel constrictions, channel roughness etc. However, for the purpose of this analysis any such losses have been neglected.Therefore, by the principle of conservation of energy, the energy posed by water in the channel at any two points (1 and 2) is same
$$H_1=H_2$$

$$\frac{p_1}{\gamma}+\frac{v_1^{2}}{2g}+z_1=\frac{p_2}{\gamma}+\frac{v_2^{2}}{2g}+z_2$$ (2)
Since, the flow is in an open channel and flowing water is exposed to the atomsphere at all points the pressure at every point is equal to the atmospheric pressure and thus can be neglected from the equation for total energy equation 2. Also, considering the channel bottom as the datum, the equation can be re-written as
$$\frac{v_1^{2}}{2g}+y_1=\frac{v_2^{2}}{2g}+y_2$$(3)

Where,
 :y1 and y2 =Depth of flow in channel at points 1 and 2 respectively(L)


Thus, specific energy in a channel is expressed as:

$$E=\frac{v^{2}}{2g}+y$$ (4)
Triangular channel
Flow of fluid through open channels is influenced by the velocity of the fluid, acceleration due to gravity, friction and the channel shape. Although most of the open channels in natural systems are irregularly shaped; it is essential to understand the effect the channel shape has on fluid flow. Principles of conservation of mass, energy and momentum are used to understand and derive relationships among the various factors influencing fluid flow in a triangular channel.
Energy-depth relationship
The energy depth relationship is useful to understand the variation of energy with the depth of fluid in the channel under different flow conditions.
Theory and general relationship
Consider a triangular channel as shown in Figure1
thumb|350px|framed|center|Figure1:Geometry of triangular channel


Where,
 :B= surface width of the liquid(L)
 :l= slope L of the triangular side
 :y= liquid depth measured from the vertex of the triangular section(L)
 :m= side slope (hori=m:verti=1)
 :A= area of the triangular channel(L2)


The area (A) of the triangular channel can be calculated as,
$$A=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\times{B}\times{y}$$
 :$$=\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\times{2my}\times{y}$$
 :$$=m\times{y}^{2}$$
  Using the specific energy equation,
$$E=\left(\frac{{v}^{2}}{2g}\right)+y$$(6)


Where,
 :v=velocity of the fluid(L/T)
 :g= acceleration due to gravity(L/T2)


Using the Continuity equation,
$$Q=A\times{v}$$ (7)


Where,
 :Q = Discharge in (L3/T)


Substituting equation 7 in equation 6,
$$E=\left(\frac{{Q}^{2}}{2g{A}^{2}}\right)+y$$
$$=\left(\frac{{Q}^{2}}{2g{m}^{2} {y}^{4}}\right)+y$$(8)

E-y diagram
Equation 8 can be used to obtain a relationship between energy (E) and depth (y) for a fixed value of discharge (Q).The resulting E-y diagram, plotted for different values of discharge(Q) is shown in Figure 2

Critical flow relationship and Froude number
For flow of a non-compressible fluid in a triangular channel, the Froude numberis given as,

$$F_r=\frac{v}{\left(g\frac{A}{B}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$(9)
$$F_r=\frac{Q}{A\left(g\frac{A}{B}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
$$F_r=\frac{Q}{my^{2}\left(g\frac{my^{2}}{2my}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$
$$F_r=\frac{Q}{\left(\frac{gm^{2}y^{5}}{2}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}}$$(10)
  At critical conditions Froude number(Fr)=1,
 :Therefore,
$$y_c=\left(\frac{2Q^{2}}{gm^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{5}}$$(11)
  The flow regimes based on Froude number are defined as:
 :$$F_r=1$$ Critical Flow
 :$$F_r>1$$ Supercritical flow
 :$$F_r<1$$ Subcritical flow
  For a given discharge, the value of minimum energy and the corresponding depth can be obtained analytically. This minimum energy is also called as critical energy and the corresponding depth is called as critical depth. Taking the derivative of equation 8 and setting the derivative to 0.
  Differentiating equation 8 with respect to y

$$\left(\frac{dE}{dy}\right)=\frac{d}{dy}\left(\frac{{Q}^{2}}{2gm^{2}y^{4}}+y\right)$$
$$\frac{dE}{dy}=1-\frac{2Q^{2}}{gm^{2}y^{5}}=1-F_r$$
$$0 =-4\left(\frac{{Q}^{2}}{2gm^{2}y_c^{5}}\right)+1=-F_r+1$$
$$1=\frac{{Q}^{2}}{gm^{2}y_c^{5}}=F_r$$
$$y_c=\left(\frac{2Q^{2}}{gm^{2}}\right)^{\frac{1}{5}}=F_r$$(15)
  This is the same result as obtained in equation 11
  The critical energy(Ec) associated with the critical depth can be calculated by substituting equation 15 in equation 8

$$E_c=\frac{{Q}^{2}}{2gm^{2}y_c^{4}}+y_c$$
$$=\frac{1}{4y_c}\left(\frac{2Q^{2}}{gm^{2}}\right)+y_c$$
$$=\frac{y_c^{5}}{4y_c}+y_c$$
$$E_c =\frac{5y_c}{4}$$(16)

Alternate depths
thumb|350px|framed|centre|Figure 3:Energy-depth diagram for triangular channel
 From Figure 3, it can be observed that for any energy greater than the critical energy; there exist two depths corresponding to the same energy.Thus , the pair of depths corresponding to the same specific energy for a given discharge(Q) and channel side slope (m) are called Alternate Depths.
  From Figure 3, it can be seen that the energy at location 1 is the same as energy at location 2. Applying equation 7 at locations 1 and 2 gives,

$$E_1=E_2$$
$$\frac{Q^{2}}{2gm^{2}y_1^{4}}+y_1=\frac{Q^{2}}{2gm^{2}y_2^{4}}+y_2$$
  Depths y1 and y2 are a pair of alternate depths. y1 corresponds to the super-critical conditions and y2 corresponds to the sub-critical conditions.

Depth-Discharge relationship
For a fixed energy, the plot of depth (y) against discharge (Q) is shown in Figure 4.For the triangular channel the discharge is maximum at critical condition.
thumb|350px|framed|centre|Figure 4:Discharge-depth relationship in a triangular cross-section

Example problem
Consider a triangular channel carrying a discharge of 3 m3/s. The channel has a side slope of 2 and depth of water in the channel is 1.54 m. The flow encounters a sluice gate which causes the flow regime to change from sub-critical to super-critical. Determine the alternate depth, the energy, and the Froude number upstream and downstream of the gate. Neglect frictional losses.
Solution:
 The energy can be calculated using equation(8) for triangular channel,
$$E_1=E_2$$

$$\frac{Q^{2}}{2gm^{2}y_1^{4}}+y_1=\frac{Q^{2}}{2gm^{2}y_2^{4}}+y_2$$

$$\frac{3^{2}}{2\times9.81\times2^{2}\times1.54^{4}}+1.54=\frac{3^{2}}{2\times9.81\times2^{2}y_2^{4}}+y_2$$
  By iteration or root finding,
$$y_2=0.58 m$$

$$E_1=E_2=\frac{Q^{2}}{2gm^{2}y^{4}}+y$$



$=\frac{3^{2}}{2\times{9.81}\times{2}^{2}\times{1.54}^{4}}+1.54$






$=1.56 m$




Calculating the Froude Numbers(Fr),

$$F_(r1)=\frac{Q}{\left(\frac{gm^{2}y^{5}}{2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}}$$



$=\frac{3}{\left(\frac{9.81\times2^{2}\times1.54^{5}}{2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}}$






$=0.23<1$




As Fr1
$$F_(r2)=\frac{Q}{\left(\frac{gm^{2}y^{5}}{2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}}$$



$=\frac{3}{\left(\frac{9.81\times2^{2}\times0.58^{5}}{2}\right)^\frac{1}{2}}$






$=2.64>1$




As Fr2 >1, the flow is super-critical.
Parabolic Section
Energy-Depth Relationship
Theory and Derivation of General Relationship
Assuming the channel to be a perfect parabola with the equation,
$$y=ax^2$$(23)

Where,
 :y= Depth of water in the channel(L)
 :2x= Top width of the channel(L)
 

(Figure)
|350px|framed|center|Figure 5: Parabolic channel geometry

$$A=\frac{2}{3}*width*height$$
 :$$=\frac{2}{3}*2x*y$$(24)

Where,
 :y=Depth of water in the channel(L)


From equation 23,
$$x=\pm\sqrt\frac{y}{a}$$(25)
Substituting in equation 24,
$$A=\frac{4}{3} \left(\frac{y^\frac{3}{2}}{a^\frac{1}{2}}\right)$$(26)
Velocity of flow in the channel determined by the continuity equation is,
$$v=\frac{Q}{A}$$(27)

Where,
 :A=Area of cross-section(L2)


Substituting equation 26 in equation 27,

$$v=\frac{Q} {\left(\frac{4}{3}\frac{4 y^\frac{3}{2}}{3 a^\frac{1}{2}}\right)}=\frac{3}{4}\left(\frac{Q a^\frac{1}{2}}{y^\frac{3}{2}}\right)$$(28)
Substituting equation 28 in the specific energy equation,
$$E=\left(\frac{3}{4}\frac{Q a^\frac{1}{2}}{y^\frac{3}{2}})^2 \frac{1}{2g}\right) + y 
 =\frac{9}{32}\left(\frac{Q^2 a}{gy^3}\right) + y$$(29)
E-y Diagram
From equation 29 for a given discharge Q, and a fixed channel cross-section, energy is a function of depth and can be plotted graphically as shown in Figure 6. From the figure we can see that line E=y is an asymptote to the curves and for a given depth, on increase in discharge results in an increase in associated specific energy. 
Critical Flow Relationship and the Froude Number
Substituting the value of v and A from equation 28 and 26 respectively in equation 10,
$$F_r=\frac{3}{4}\frac{Q a^\frac{1}{2}}{y^\frac{2}{3}} \frac{1}{\sqrt{\frac{2}{3}gy}}$$


$=\frac{3^\frac{3}{2}}{2^\frac{5}{2}}\left(\frac{Qa^\frac{1}{2}}{g^\frac{1}{2}y^2}\right)$(30)
 



Critical Depth
Solving the above equation for critical conditions, i.e. Fr=1,


$y_c=\sqrt{\frac{3^\frac{3}{2}}{2^\frac{5}{2}}\frac{Qa^\frac{1}{2}}{g\frac{1}{2}}}$



or, $y_c=\frac{3^\frac{3}{4}}{2^\frac{5}{4}}\left(\frac{Q^\frac{1}{2}a^\frac{1}{4}}{g^\frac{1}{4}}\right)$(31)
 


Where,
 :yc=Critical Depth(L)


Alternatively, the critical flow condition can also be defined as the condition for minimum energy of flow for a given discharge and can be mathematically derived as:
Taking the derivative of the specific energy for a parabolic channel as expressed in equation 29,
$$\frac{d}{d y}E=\frac{d}{d y} \left( \frac{9}{32}\frac{Q^2 a}{gy^3} + y\right)$$
$$\frac{dE}{d y}= -\frac{27}{32}\left(\frac{Q^2 a}{gy^4}\right) + 1$$(32)
At minimum energy,
$$\frac{dE}{d x}=0$$


$=-\frac{27}{32}\left(\frac{Q^2 a}{gy^4}\right) + 1$



$y_c=\frac{27}{32}\left(\frac{Q^2 a}{g}\right)$

$y_c =\frac{3^\frac{3}{4}}{2^\frac{5}{4}}\left(\frac{Q^\frac{1}{2} a^\frac{1}{4}}{g^\frac{1}{4}}\right)$(33)
 

The mathematical expression obtained from the equation 33 is the same as that obtained from equation 31.
Critical Energy
Substituting the value of critical depth obtained from the equation 33 in the equation for specific energy (equation 29),
$$E_c= \frac{2^\frac{3}{4}}{3^\frac{1}{4}}\left(\frac{Q^\frac{1}{2} a^\frac{1}{4}}{g^\frac{1}{4}}\right)$$(34)

Where,
 :Ec=Critical Energy(L)


Also,
$$E_c= \frac{4}{3}y_c$$(35)
(Figure)
|350px|framed|center|Figure 7: Flow regimes in a parabolic channel flow

Subcritical Depth
At subcritical flow conditions the Fr 
$$F_r =\frac{3^\frac{3}{2}}{2^\frac{5}{2}}\left(\frac{Qa^\frac{1}{2}}{g^\frac{1}{2}y^2}\right)$$
$$y_{sub} >\frac{3^\frac{3}{4}}{2^\frac{5}{4}}\left(\frac{Qa^\frac{1}{4}}{g^\frac{1}{4}}\right)$$ or, $y_{sub} >y_c$(36)

Where,
 :ysub= Subcritical Energy(L)


i.e., subcritical depth is always greater than critical depth.
Supercritical Depth
At supercritical flow conditions the Fr $>$1. i.e.
$$F_r =\frac{3^\frac{3}{2}}{2^\frac{5}{2}}\left(\frac{Qa^\frac{1}{2}}{g^\frac{1}{2}y^2}\right) >1$$
$$y_{super} <\frac{3^\frac{3}{4}}{2^\frac{5}{4}}\left(\frac{Qa^\frac{1}{4}}{g^\frac{1}{4}}\right)$$
 or, $y_{super}  {{pad|3.0em}}(37)
 
 :Where,
 ::ysuper= Supercritical Energy(''L'')
 
 i.e., subcritical depth is always greater than critical depth.
 
 ==== Alternate Depths ====
 
 From the E-y Diagram for the Parabolic Channel as shown in Figure 8  we can see that for a given discharge and energy, there are two possible flow depths except in the case of critical depth/critical energy, namely y1 and y2 and are called alternate depths. Where, y1 corresponds to depth of flow at subcritical conditions and y2 corresponds to depth at subrcritical conditions.
 
 [[File:alternatedepth_parabolic.png|thumb||350px|framed|center|Figure 8: Alternate Depths in a Parabolic Channel]]
 
 By, the basic definition of alternate depths the energy E1 and E2 corresponding to depths y1 and y2, are equal. Therefore, for a given depth the conjugate depth can be mathematically derived as follows,
 
 :
$$\frac{9}{32}\left(\frac{Q^2 a}{gy_1^3}\right) + y_1=\frac{9}{32}\left(\frac{Q^2 a}{gy_2^3}\right) + y_2$$(38)
  If the depth of flow(y1 or y2) is known, the above equation can be used to solve for the other alternate depth. The equation can be solved empirically using a root-finding procedure such as the trial and error method or using computer tools like Microsoft Excel goal seek tool).
Depth-Discharge Relationship
Figure 9 illustrates the relationship between discharge and depth in a parabolic channel for a given energy of flow E* and channel geometry. It can be seen from the figure, that with an increase in the depth of flow, the discharge in the channel increases until the depth of flow reaches the critical depth. An increase in flow depth beyond the critical depth results in a decrease of discharge through the channel. Therefore, for a given energy and channel geometry, discharge is maximum at critical conditions i.e., when the flow depth is equal to the critical depth.

Example Problem
The concept of subcritical and supercritical flow regimes in a parabolic channel can be demonstrated by the following sluice gate problem.
Given a flow of 1.50 m3/s and a parabolic channel cross-section of y=3x2 and a depth of 1.30 m. The flow encounters a sluice gate lowered into the channel causing a change in flow regime from subcritical to supercritical conditions and we assume there is no loss of energy due to friction. We will determine the alternate depth, specific energy and the Froude number at the upstream and downstream location of the sluice gate.
y1=1.30 m, Q=1.50 m3/s, a=3 and g=9.81 m/s2
Specific Energy upstream of sluice gate
Using equation 29 and substituting value of y, Q, g and a
$$E_1=\frac{9}{32}\left(\frac{1.50^2 \times3}{9.81\times1.3_1^3}\right) + 1.3 = 1.46 m$$
Specific Energy downstream of sluice gate
By the principle of conservation of energy,
$$E_1=E_2= 1.46 m$$
Alternate Depth
Using equation 38 and substituting value of Q,a and y,

$$\frac{9}{32}\times\left(\frac{1.50^2 \times{3}}{9.81\times1.3^3}\right) + 1.3  = \frac{9}{32}\times\left(\frac{1.50^2 \times3}{9.81\times y_2^3}\right) + y_2$$
Using the goal seek tool in Microsoft Excel or by a trial and error method to solve the above equation,
$$y_2=0.81 m$$
The Froude number upstream of the sluice gate
Using equation 30,
$$F_r  =\frac{3^\frac{3}{2}}{2^\frac{5}{2}}\left(\frac{1.50\times 3^\frac{1}{2}}{9.81^\frac{1}{2}\times 1.3^2}\right)$$


$=0.60$




The Froude number downstream of the sluice gate
Using equation 30,
$$F_r  =\frac{3^\frac{3}{2}}{2^\frac{5}{2}}\left(\frac{0.81\times 3^\frac{1}{2}}{9.81^\frac{1}{2}\times 0.81^2}\right)$$
$$=1.55$$
