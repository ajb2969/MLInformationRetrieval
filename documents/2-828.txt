   Normal operator      Normal operator   In mathematics , especially functional analysis , a normal operator on a complex Hilbert space  H is a continuous  linear operator  N : H ‚Üí H that commutes with its hermitian adjoint  N* , that is: NN* = N*N . 1  Normal operators are important because the spectral theorem holds for them. The class of normal operators is well-understood. Examples of normal operators are   unitary operators : N* = ''N ‚àí1  Hermitian operators (i.e., self-adjoint operators): N* = N  Skew-Hermitian operators: N* = ‚àí N  positive operators : N = MM* for some M (so N is self-adjoint).   A normal matrix is the matrix expression of a normal operator on the Hilbert space C n .  Properties  Normal operators are characterized by the spectral theorem . A compact normal operator (in particular, a normal operator on a finite-dimensional linear space) is unitarily diagonalizable.  Let T be a bounded operator. The following are equivalent.   T is normal.  T* is normal.  || Tx || = || T*x || for all x (use      ‚à•   T  x   ‚à•   2   =   ‚ü®    T  *   T  x   ,  x  ‚ü©   =   ‚ü®   T   T  *   x   ,  x  ‚ü©   =    ‚à•    T  *   x   ‚à•   2          superscript   norm    T  x    2       superscript  T    T  x   x           T   superscript  T    x   x         superscript   norm     superscript  T    x    2      \|Tx\|^{2}=\langle T^{*}Tx,x\rangle=\langle TT^{*}x,x\rangle=\|T^{*}x\|^{2}   ).  The selfadjoint and anti-selfadjoint parts of T commute. That is, if we write    T  ‚â°    T  1   +   i   T  2         T     subscript  T  1     i   subscript  T  2       T\equiv T_{1}+iT_{2}   with     T  1   :=    T  +   T  *    2      assign   subscript  T  1       T   superscript  T     2     T_{1}:=\frac{T+T^{*}}{2}   and       i    T  2    :=    T  -   T  *    2    ,     assign    i   subscript  T  2        T   superscript  T     2     i\,T_{2}:=\frac{T-T^{*}}{2},   , then      T  1    T  2    =    T  2    T  1           subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2       subscript  T  2    subscript  T  1      T_{1}T_{2}=T_{2}T_{1}   . 2   If N is a normal operator, then N and N* have the same kernel and range. Consequently, the range of N is dense if and only if N is injective. Put in another way, the kernel of a normal operator is the orthogonal complement of its range. It follows that the kernel of the operator N k coincides with that of N for any k . Every generalized eigenvalue of a normal operator is thus genuine. Œª is an eigenvalue of a normal operator N if and only if its complex conjugate    Œª  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  Œª    \overline{\lambda}   is an eigenvalue of N* . Eigenvectors of a normal operator corresponding to different eigenvalues are orthogonal, and a normal operator stabilizes the orthogonal complement of each of its eigenspaces. 3 This implies the usual spectral theorem: every normal operator on a finite-dimensional space is diagonalizable by a unitary operator. There is also an infinite-dimensional version of the spectral theorem expressed in terms of projection-valued measures . The residual spectrum of a normal operator is empty. 4  The product of normal operators that commute is again normal; this is nontrivial, but follows directly from Fuglede's theorem , which states (in a form generalized by Putnam):   If    N  1     subscript  N  1    N_{1}   and    N  2     subscript  N  2    N_{2}   are normal operators and if A is a bounded linear operator such that      N  1   A   =   A   N  2           subscript  N  1   A     A   subscript  N  2      N_{1}A=AN_{2}   , then      N  1  *   A   =   A   N  2  *           superscript   subscript  N  1     A     A   superscript   subscript  N  2        N_{1}^{*}A=AN_{2}^{*}   .   The operator norm of a normal operator equals its numerical radius and spectral radius .  A normal operator coincides with its Aluthge transform .  Properties in finite-dimensional case  If a normal operator T on a finite-dimensional real or complex Hilbert space (inner product space) H stabilizes a subspace V , then it also stabilizes its orthogonal complement V ‚ä• . (This statement is trivial in the case where T is self-adjoint.)  Proof. Let P V be the orthogonal projection onto V . Then the orthogonal projection onto V ‚ä• is 1 H ‚àí P V . The fact that T stabilizes V can be expressed as ( 1 H ‚àí P V ) TP V = 0, or TP V = P V TP V . The goal is to show that X := P V T ( 1 H ‚àí P V ) = 0. Since ( A , B ) ‚Ü¶ tr( AB* ) is an inner product on the space of endomorphisms of H , it is enough to show that tr( XX* ) = 0. But first we express XX* in terms of orthogonal projections:       X   X  *    =    P  V   T    (    ùüè  H   -   P  V    )   2    T  *    P  V    =    P  V   T   (    ùüè  H   -   P  V    )    T  *    P  V    =     P  V   T   T  *    P  V    -    P  V   T   P  V    T  *    P  V             X   superscript  X        subscript  P  V   T   superscript     subscript  1  H    subscript  P  V    2    superscript  T     subscript  P  V            subscript  P  V   T     subscript  1  H    subscript  P  V     superscript  T     subscript  P  V              subscript  P  V   T   superscript  T     subscript  P  V       subscript  P  V   T   subscript  P  V    superscript  T     subscript  P  V        XX^{*}=P_{V}T(\boldsymbol{1}_{H}-P_{V})^{2}T^{*}P_{V}=P_{V}T(\boldsymbol{1}_{H%
 }-P_{V})T^{*}P_{V}=P_{V}TT^{*}P_{V}-P_{V}TP_{V}T^{*}P_{V}   ,  Now using properties of the trace and of orthogonal projections we have:      tr   (   X   X  *    )      tr    X   superscript  X       \displaystyle\operatorname{tr}(XX^{*})     The same argument goes through for compact normal operators in infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces, where one make use of the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product, defined by tr( AB* ) suitably interpreted. 5 However, for bounded normal operators orthogonal complement to a stable subspace may not be stable. 6 It follows that the Hilbert space cannot be spanned by eigenvectors of such an operator. Consider, for example, the bilateral shift (or two-sided shift) acting on    ‚Ñì  2     superscript  normal-‚Ñì  2    \ell^{2}   , which is normal, but has no eigenvalues.  The invariant subspaces of a shift acting on Hardy space are characterized by Beurling's theorem .  Normal elements of algebras  The notion of normal operators generalizes to an involutive algebra:  An element x of an involutive algebra is said to be normal if xx* = x*x .  Selfadjoint and unitary elements are normal.  The most important case is when such an algebra is a C*-algebra .  Unbounded normal operators  The definition of normal operators naturally generalizes to some class of unbounded operators. Explicitly, a closed operator N is said to be normal if we can write         N  *   N   =   N   N  *     .         superscript  N    N     N   superscript  N       N^{*}N=NN^{*}.   Here, the existence of the adjoint N* requires that the domain of N be dense, and the equality includes the assertion that the domain of N*N equals that of NN* , which is not necessarily the case in general.  Equivalently normal operators are precisely those for which 7        ‚à•   N  x   ‚à•   =   ‚à•    N  *   x   ‚à•         norm    N  x     norm     superscript  N    x      \|Nx\|=\|N^{*}x\|\qquad   with         ùíü    (  N  )    =   ùíü   (   N  *   )     .        ùíü  N     ùíü   superscript  N       \qquad\mathcal{D}(N)=\mathcal{D}(N^{*}).   The spectral theorem still holds for unbounded (normal) operators. The proofs work by reduction to bounded (normal) operators. 8 9  Generalization  The success of the theory of normal operators led to several attempts for generalization by weakening the commutativity requirement.
