Normal form for free groups and free product of groups

In mathematics, particularly in combinatorial group theory, a normal form for a free group over a set of generators or for a free product of groups is a representation of an element by a simpler element, the element being either in the free group or free products of group. In case of free group these simpler elements are reduced words and in the case of free product of groups these are reduced sequences. The precise definitions of these are given below. As it turns out, for a free group and for the free product of groups, there exists a unique normal form i.e each element is representable by a simpler element and this representation is unique. This is the Normal Form Theorem for the free groups and for the free product of groups. The proof here of the Normal Form Theorem follows the idea of Artin and van der Waerden.
Normal form for free groups
Let 
 
 
 
  be a free group with generating set

 
 . Each element in 
 
 
 
  is represented by a word 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 

Definition (reduced word)
A word 
 
 
 
  is reduced if it contains no part 
 
 
 
 .
Definition (normal form)
A normal form for a free group

 
 
  with generating set

 
  is a choice of a reduced word in 
 
 
 
  for each element of

Normal form theorem for free groups
Statement A free group has a unique normal form i.e. each element in 
 
 
 
  is represented by a unique reduced word.
Proof An elementary transformation of a word 
 
 
 
 
  consists of inserting or deleting a part of the form 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Two words 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are equivalent, 
 
 
 
 
 , if there is a chain of elementary transformations leading from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . This is obviously an equivalence relation on 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of reduced words. We shall show that each equivalence class of words contains exactly one reduced word. It is clear that each equivalence class contains a reduced word, since successive deletion of parts 
 
 
 
 
  from any word 
 
 
 
  must lead to a reduced word. It will suffice then to show that distinct reduced words 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are not equivalent. For each 
 
 
 
  define a permutation 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  by setting 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is reduced and 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the group of permutations of 
 
 
 
  generated by the 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the multiplicative extension of 
 
 
 
 
  to a map 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 ; moreover 
 
 
 
  is reduced with 
 
 
 
 
  It follows that if 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  reduced, then 
 
 
 
 .





Normal form for free products
Let 
 
 
 
  be the free product of groups 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Every element 
 
 
 
  is represented by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 
 .
Definition (reduced sequence)
A reduced sequence is a sequence 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  with the property that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are not in the same factor 
 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
Definition (normal form)
A normal form for a free product of groups is a representation or choice of a reduced sequence for each element in the free product.
Normal form theorem for free product of groups
There are two equivalent version of normal form theorem in the case of free products.
Statement Consider the free product 
 
 
 
  of two groups 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then the following two equivalent statements hold.

If 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a reduced sequence, then 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
Each element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  can be written uniquely as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a reduced sequence (for 
 
 
 
  we will take the reduced sequence to be empty).

Proof : First consider the equivalence of the above two statements.
The second statement implies the first is easy.
Suppose the first statement holds. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , then we have 
 
 
 
 , which implies 
 
 
 
  Hence by first statement left hand side cannot be reduced. This can happen only if 
 
 
 
 , i.e 
 
 
 
  Proceeding inductively we have 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  This shows both statements are equivalent.
Now we will show that these statements hold.
Let 
 
 
 
  be the set of all reduced sequences in 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the group of permutations of 
 
 
 
 . Define 
 
 
 
  as follows. If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . Otherwise define 
 
 
 
 
  as



Similarly we define 
 
 
 
 .
It is easy to check that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are homomorphisms. Therefore by universal property of free product we will get a unique map 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Now suppose 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a reduced sequence, then 
 
 
 
 
  Therefore 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 
 
 , a contradiction.
