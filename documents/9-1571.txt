   Huber's equation      Huber's equation   Huber's equation , first derived by a Polish engineer Tytus Maksymilian Huber , is a basic formula in elastic material tension calculations, an equivalent of the equation of state , but applying to solids. In most simple expression and commonly in use it looks like this:       σ   r  e  d    =     (   σ  2   )   +   3   (   τ  2   )           subscript  σ    r  e  d         superscript  σ  2     3   superscript  τ  2        \sigma_{red}=\sqrt{({\sigma}^{2})+3({\tau}^{2})}     where   σ   σ   \sigma   is the tensile stress , and   τ   τ   \tau   is the shear stress , measured in newtons per square meter (N/m², also called pascals , Pa), while    σ   r  e  d      subscript  σ    r  e  d     \sigma_{red}   - called a reduced tension, is the resultant tension of the material.  Very useful in calculating the span width of the bridges like Golden Gate Bridge or Verrazano-Narrows Bridge , their beam cross-sections, etc.  See also   Yield surface  Stress–energy tensor  Tensile stress   "  Category:Physical quantities  Category:Structural analysis
