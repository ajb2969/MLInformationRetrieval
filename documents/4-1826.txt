   Areal velocity      Areal velocity   In classical mechanics , areal velocity (also called sector velocity or sectorial velocity ) is the rate at which area is swept out by a particle as it moves along a curve . In the adjoining figure, suppose that a particle moves along the blue curve. At a certain time t , the particle is located at point B , and a short while later, at time t + Δ t , the particle has moved to point C . The area swept out by the particle is the green area in the figure, bounded by the line segments AB and AC and the curve along which the particle moves. The areal velocity equals this area divided by the time interval Δ t in the limit that Δ t becomes vanishingly small.  The concept of areal velocity is closely linked historically with the concept of angular momentum . Kepler's second law states that the areal velocity of a planet, with the sun taken as origin, is constant. Isaac Newton was the first scientist to recognize the dynamical significance of Kepler's second law. With the aid of his laws of motion, he proved in 1684 that any planet that is attracted to a fixed center sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time. By the middle of the 18th century, the principle of angular momentum was discovered gradually by Daniel Bernoulli and Leonhard Euler and Patrick d'Arcy ; d'Arcy's version of the principle was phrased in terms of swept area. For this reason, the principle of angular momentum was often referred to in the older literature in mechanics as "the principle of areas." Since the concept of angular momentum includes more than just geometry, the designation "principle of areas" has been dropped in modern works.  Connection with angular momentum  In the situation of the first figure, the area swept out during time period Δ t by the particle is approximately equal to the area of triangle ABC . As Δt approaches zero this near-equality becomes exact as a limit .  Let the point D be the fourth corner of parallelogram ABDC shown in the figure, so that the vectors AB and AC add up by the parallelogram rule to vector AD . Then the area of triangle ABC is half the area of parallelogram ABDC , and the area of ABDC is equal to the magnitude of the cross product of vectors AB and AC . This area can also be viewed as a vector with this magnitude, pointing in a direction perpendicular to the parallelogram; this vector is the cross product itself:        vector area of parallelogram  A  B  C  D   =      r  →    (  t  )    ×   r  →     (   t  +   Δ  t    )     .        vector area of parallelogram  A  B  C  D          normal-→  r   t    normal-→  r      t    normal-Δ  t       \text{vector area of parallelogram }ABCD=\vec{r}(t)\times\vec{r}(t+\Delta t).     Hence        vector area of triangle  A  B  C   =       r  →    (  t  )    ×   r  →     (   t  +   Δ  t    )    2    .        vector area of triangle  A  B  C            normal-→  r   t    normal-→  r      t    normal-Δ  t     2     \text{vector area of triangle }ABC=\frac{\vec{r}(t)\times\vec{r}(t+\Delta t)}{%
 2}.     The areal velocity is this area divided by Δ t in the limit that Δ t becomes vanishingly small:       =    lim    Δ  t   →  0          r  →    (  t  )    ×   r  →     (   t  +   Δ  t    )     2  Δ  t          absent    subscript    normal-→    normal-Δ  t   0             normal-→  r   t    normal-→  r      t    normal-Δ  t       2  normal-Δ  t       \displaystyle=\lim_{\Delta t\rightarrow 0}\frac{\vec{r}(t)\times\vec{r}(t+%
 \Delta t)}{2\Delta t}     But,       r  →    ′    (  t  )        superscript   normal-→  r   normal-′   t    \vec{r}\,^{\prime}(t)   is the velocity vector     v  →    (  t  )        normal-→  v   t    \vec{v}(t)   of the moving particle, so that         d   A  →     d  t    =     r  →   ×   v  →    2    .          d   normal-→  A      d  t         normal-→  r    normal-→  v    2     \frac{d\vec{A}}{dt}=\frac{\vec{r}\times\vec{v}}{2}.     On the other hand, the angular momentum of the particle is        L  →   =     r  →   ×  m    v  →     ,       normal-→  L        normal-→  r   m    normal-→  v      \vec{L}=\vec{r}\times m\vec{v},     and hence the angular momentum equals 2 m times the areal velocity.  Conservation of areal velocity is a general property of central force motion . 1  References        See also   Angular momentum  Specific angular momentum  Elliptical coordinates   "  Category:Physical quantities  Category:Curves     ↩
