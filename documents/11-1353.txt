   Procollagen galactosyltransferase      Procollagen galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a procollagen galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + procollagen 5-hydroxy-L-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + procollagen 5-(D-galactosyloxy)-L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and procollagen 5-hydroxy-L-lysine , whereas its two products are UDP and procollagen 5-(D-galactosyloxy)-L-lysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:procollagen-5-hydroxy-L-lysine D-galactosyltransferase. Other names in common use include hydroxylysine galactosyltransferase, collagen galactosyltransferase, collagen hydroxylysyl galactosyltransferase, UDP galactose-collagen galactosyltransferase, uridine diphosphogalactose-collagen galactosyltransferase, and UDPgalactose:5-hydroxylysine-collagen galactosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
