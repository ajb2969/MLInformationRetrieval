   Taylor–Goldstein equation      Taylor–Goldstein equation   The Taylor–Goldstein equation is an ordinary differential equation used in the fields of geophysical fluid dynamics , and more generally in fluid dynamics , in presence of quasi- 2D flows. 1 It describes the dynamics of the Kelvin–Helmholtz instability , subject to buoyancy forces (e.g. gravity), for stably stratified fluids in the dissipation-less limit . Or, more generally, the dynamics of internal waves in the presence of a (continuous) density stratification and shear flow . The Taylor–Goldstein equation is derived from the 2D Euler equations , using the Boussinesq approximation . 2  The equation is named after G.I. Taylor and S. Goldstein , who derived the equation independently from each other in 1931. The third independent derivation, also in 1931, was made by B. Haurwitz. 3  Formulation  The equation is derived by solving a linearized version of the Navier–Stokes equation , in presence of gravity   g   g   g   and a mean density gradient (with gradient-length    L  ρ     subscript  L  ρ    L_{\rho}   ), for the perturbation velocity field       𝐮  =   [    U   (  z  )    +    u  ′    (  x  ,  z  ,  t  )     ,  0  ,    w  ′    (  x  ,  z  ,  t  )    ]    ,      𝐮       U  z      superscript  u  normal-′    x  z  t     0     superscript  w  normal-′    x  z  t       \mathbf{u}=\left[U(z)+u^{\prime}(x,z,t),0,w^{\prime}(x,z,t)\right],\,     where    (   U   (  z  )    ,  0  ,  0  )       U  z   0  0    (U(z),0,0)   is the unperturbed or basic flow. The perturbation velocity has the wave -like solution     𝐮  ′   ∝   exp   (   i  α   (   x  -   c  t    )    )       proportional-to   superscript  𝐮  normal-′       i  α    x    c  t        \mathbf{u}^{\prime}\propto\exp(i\alpha(x-ct))   ( real part understood). Using this knowledge, and the streamfunction representation      u  x  ′   =     d   ϕ  ~    /  d   z    ,    u  z  ′   =   -   i  α   ϕ  ~         formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  u  x   normal-′         d   normal-~  ϕ    d   z       superscript   subscript  u  z   normal-′       i  α   normal-~  ϕ        u_{x}^{\prime}=d\tilde{\phi}/dz,u_{z}^{\prime}=-i\alpha\tilde{\phi}   for the flow, the following dimensional form of the Taylor–Goldstein equation is obtained:           (   U  -  c   )   2    (      d  2    ϕ  ~     d   z  2     -    α  2    ϕ  ~     )    +    [    N  2   -    (   U  -  c   )      d  2   U    d   z  2       ]    ϕ  ~     =  0   ,           superscript    U  c   2          superscript  d  2    normal-~  ϕ      d   superscript  z  2        superscript  α  2    normal-~  ϕ         delimited-[]     superscript  N  2       U  c        superscript  d  2   U     d   superscript  z  2         normal-~  ϕ     0    (U-c)^{2}\left({d^{2}\tilde{\phi}\over dz^{2}}-\alpha^{2}\tilde{\phi}\right)+%
 \left[N^{2}-(U-c){d^{2}U\over dz^{2}}\right]\tilde{\phi}=0,     where    N  =    g   L  ρ         N      g   subscript  L  ρ       N=\sqrt{g\over L_{\rho}}   denotes the Brunt–Väisälä frequency . The eigenvalue parameter of the problem is   c   c   c   . If the imaginary part of the wave speed    c   c   c   is positive, then the flow is unstable, and the small perturbation introduced to the system is amplified in time.  Note that a purely imaginary Brunt–Väisälä frequency   N   N   N   results in a flow which is always unstable. This instability is known as the Rayleigh–Taylor instability .  No-slip boundary conditions  The relevant boundary conditions are, in case of the no-slip boundary conditions at the channel top and bottom    z  =   z  1       z   subscript  z  1     z=z_{1}   and     z  =   z  2    :      normal-:    z   subscript  z  2    absent    z=z_{2}:            α   ϕ  ~    =    d   ϕ  ~     d  z    =  0     at  z   =    z  1   and  z   =   z  2     .     formulae-sequence        α   normal-~  ϕ        d   normal-~  ϕ      d  z         0          at  z      subscript  z  1   and  z         subscript  z  2       \alpha\tilde{\phi}={d\tilde{\phi}\over dz}=0\quad\text{ at }z=z_{1}\text{ and %
