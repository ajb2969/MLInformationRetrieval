   Glucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase      Glucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase   In enzymology , a glucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GTP + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + GDP-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GTP and alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and GDP-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP:alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase . Other names in common use include GDP glucose pyrophosphorylase , and guanosine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .
