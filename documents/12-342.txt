   Lindemann index      Lindemann index   The Lindemann index 1 is a simple measure of thermally driven disorder in atoms or molecules. The local Lindemann index is defined as: 2      q  i   =    1   N  -  1      ∑   j  ≠  i        ⟨   r   i  j   2   ⟩   -    ⟨   r   i  j    ⟩   2      ⟨   r   i  j    ⟩           subscript  q  i       1    N  1      subscript     j  i           delimited-⟨⟩   superscript   subscript  r    i  j    2     superscript   delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  r    i  j     2      delimited-⟨⟩   subscript  r    i  j          q_{i}=\frac{1}{N-1}\sum_{j\neq i}\frac{\sqrt{\langle r_{ij}^{2}\rangle-\langle
 r%
 _{ij}\rangle^{2}}}{\langle r_{ij}\rangle}     Where angle brackets indicate a time average. The global Lindemann index is a system average of this quantity.   In condensed matter physics : a departure from linearity in the behaviour of the global Lindemann index or an increase above a threshold value related to the spacing between atoms (or micelles , particles, globules, etc.) is often taken as the indication that a solid-liquid phase transition has taken place. See Lindemann melting criterion .    Biomolecules : often possess separate regions with different order characteristics. In order to quantify or illustrate local disorder, the local Lindemann index can be used. 3   Care must be taken if the molecule possesses globally defined dynamics, such as about a hinge or pivot, because these motions will obscure the local motions which the Lindemann index is designed to quantify. An appropriate tactic in this circumstance is to sum the r ij only over a small number of neighbouring atoms to arrive at each q i . A further variety of such modifications to the Lindemann index are available and have different merits, e.g. for the study of glassy vs crystalline materials. 4  References  "  Category:Molecular physics  Category:Condensed matter physics  Category:Dimensionless numbers     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
