Timeline of the far future

(Figure)
What Earth might look like seven billion years from now, after the Sun has entered the red giant phase

While predictions of the future can never be absolutely certain,1 present scientific understanding in various fields has allowed a projected course for the furthest future events to be sketched out, if only in the broadest strokes. These fields include astrophysics, which has revealed how planets and stars form, interact, and die; particle physics, which has revealed how matter behaves at the smallest scales; evolutionary biology, which predicts how life will evolve over time; and plate tectonics, which shows how continents shift over millennia.
All predictions of the future of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy available to do work, must increase over time.2 Stars eventually must exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters will gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.3 Eventually, matter itself will come under the influence of radioactive decay, as even the most stable materials break apart into subatomic particles.4 Current data suggests that the Universe is flat, and thus, will not collapse in on itself after a finite time,5 and the infinite future potentially allows for the occurrence of a number of massively improbable events, such as the formation of a Boltzmann brain.6
The timelines displayed here cover events from roughly eight thousand years from now to the furthest reaches of future time. A number of alternate future events are listed to account for questions still unresolved, such as whether humans will become extinct, whether protons decay, or whether Earth will survive the Sun's expansion into a red giant.

If a failure of the Wilkes Subglacial Basin "ice plug" in the next few centuries were to endanger the East Antarctic Ice Sheet, it will take up to this long to melt completely.

The Sun's increasing luminosity begins to disrupt the carbonate–silicate cycle; higher luminosity increases weathering of surface rocks, which traps carbon dioxide in the ground as carbonate. As water evaporates from the Earth's surface, rocks harden, causing plate tectonics to slow and eventually stop. Without volcanoes to recycle carbon into the Earth's atmosphere, carbon dioxide levels begin to fall.51 By this time, carbon dioxide levels will fall to the point at which C3 photosynthesis is no longer possible. All plants that utilize C3 photosynthesis (~99 percent of present-day species) will die.52

Low estimate for the time until star formation ends in galaxies as galaxies are depleted of the gas clouds they need to form stars.95 The universe's expansion, assuming a constant dark energy density, multiplies the wavelength of the cosmic microwave background by 1029, exceeding the scale of the cosmic light horizon and rendering its evidence of the Big Bang undetectable.

3×1013 (30 trillion)

Estimated time for stars to undergo a close encounter with another star in local stellar neighborhoods. Whenever two stars (or stellar remnants) pass close to each other, their planets' orbits can be disrupted, potentially ejecting them from the system entirely. On average, the closer a planet's orbit to its parent star the longer it takes to be ejected in this manner, because it is gravitationally more tightly bound to the star.97

1.1–1.2×1014 (110–120 trillion)

Time by which all stars in the universe will have exhausted their fuel (the longest-lived stars, low-mass red dwarfs, have lifespans of roughly 10–20 trillion years).100 After this point, the stellar-mass objects remaining are stellar remnants (white dwarfs, neutron stars and black holes). Brown dwarfs also remain. Collisions between brown dwarfs will create new red dwarf stars on a marginal level: on average, about 100 stars will be shining in the galaxy. Collisions between stellar remnants will create occasional supernovae.101

Astronomy and astrophysics


1019 to 1020 (10–100 quintillion)

Estimated time until 90% – 99% of brown dwarfs and stellar remnants (including the Sun) are ejected from galaxies. When two objects pass close enough to each other, they exchange orbital energy, with lower-mass objects tending to gain energy. Through repeated encounters, the lower-mass objects can gain enough energy in this manner to be ejected from their galaxy. This process eventually causes the galaxy to eject the majority of its brown dwarfs and stellar remnants.104105

1020 (100 quintillion)

Estimated time until the Earth collides with the black dwarf Sun due to the decay of its orbit via emission of gravitational radiation,106 if the Earth is not ejected from its orbit by a stellar encounter or engulfed by the Sun during its red giant phase.107

1030

Estimated time until those stars not ejected from galaxies (1% – 10%) fall into their galaxies' central supermassive black holes. By this point, with binary stars having fallen into each other, and planets into their stars, via emission of gravitational radiation, only solitary objects (stellar remnants, brown dwarfs, ejected planets, black holes) will remain in the universe.108

1.7×10106

Estimated time until a supermassive black hole with a mass of 20 trillion solar masses decays by the Hawking process.118 This marks the end of the Black Hole Era.

Low estimate for the time until all objects exceeding the Planck mass collapse via quantum tunnelling into black holes, assuming no proton decay or virtual black holes.123 On this vast timescale, even ultra-stable iron stars are destroyed by quantum tunnelling events. First iron stars of sufficient mass will collapse via tunnelling into neutron stars. Subsequently neutron stars and any remaining iron stars collapse via tunnelling into black holes. The subsequent evaporation of each resulting black hole into sub-atomic particles (a process lasting roughly 10100 years) is on these timescales instantaneous.

By this point, halfway through the precessional cycle, Earth's axial tilt will be reversed, causing summer and winter to occur on opposite sides of Earth's orbit. This means that the seasons in the northern hemisphere, which experiences more pronounced seasonal variation due to a higher percentage of land, will be even more extreme, as it will be facing towards the Sun at Earth's perihelion and away from the Sun at aphelion.173

The Waste Isolation Pilot Plant, for nuclear weapons waste, is planned to be protected until this time, with a "Permanent Marker" system designed to warn off visitors through both multiple languages (the six UN languages and Navajo) and through pictograms.186 (The Human Interference Task Force has provided the theoretical basis for United States plans for future nuclear semiotics.) The Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository is required by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to maintain an annual dose limit of 15 millirem until this time.187
