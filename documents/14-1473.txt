   Fraction of inspired oxygen      Fraction of inspired oxygen   Fraction of inspired oxygen ( Fi O 2 ) is the fraction or percentage of oxygen in the space being measured. Medical patients experiencing difficulty breathing are provided with oxygen-enriched air, which means a higher-than-atmospheric Fi O 2 . Natural air includes 20.9% oxygen, which is equivalent to Fi O 2 of 0.209. Oxygen-enriched air has a higher Fi O 2 than 0.21, up to 1.00, which means 100% oxygen. Fi O 2 is typically maintained below 0.5 even with mechanical ventilation, to avoid oxygen toxicity . 1 If a patient is wearing a nasal cannula or a simple face mask, each additional liter of oxygen adds about 4% to their FiO2 (for example, a patient with a nasal cannula with 2L of oxygen attached would have an FIO2 of 21% + 8% =29%).  Often used in medicine the Fi O 2 is used to represent the percentage of oxygen participating in gas-exchange. If the barometric pressure changes, the Fi O 2 may remain constant while the partial pressure of oxygen changes with the change in barometric pressure.

 }}}        P A O 2 , P E O 2 , and P i O 2 are the partial pressures of oxygen in alveolar, expired, and inspired gas, respectively, and VD/VT is the ratio of physiologic dead space over tidal volume.  Medicine  In medicine the Fi O 2 is the assumed percentage of oxygen concentration participating in gas exchange in the alveoli . 2  Uses  The ratio between partial pressure of oxygen in arterial blood ( PaO2 ) and Fi O 2 is used as an indicator of hypoxemia per the American-European Consensus Conference on lung injury . A high Fi O 2 has been shown to alter the ratio of PaO2/ Fi O 2 . 3  PaO2/FiO2 ratio  The ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen, sometimes called the Carrico index , is a comparison between the oxygen level in the blood and the oxygen concentration that is breathed. This helps to determine the degree of any problems with how the lungs transfer oxygen to the blood. 4 A sample of arterial blood is collected for this test. 5 A PaO2/FiO2 ratio less than or equal to 200 mmHg is necessary for the diagnosis of acute respiratory distress syndrome by the AECC criteria. 6 The more recent Berlin criteria defines mild ARDS at a ratio of  P_A O_2 = F_I O_2(PB-P H_2 O) - P_A CO_2 (F_I O_2 + \frac{1-FIO2}{R})  See also   Oxygen toxicity   References  External links   FiO2 by Delivery Device - Shows FiO2 by common oxygen deliver systems.
