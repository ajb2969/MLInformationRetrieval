1,4-lactonase

In enzymology, a 1,4-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the generic chemical reaction:

a 1,4-lactone + H2O 
 
 
 
  a 4-hydroxyacid
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,4-lactone and H2O, whereas its product is 4-hydroxyacid.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,4-lactone hydroxyacylhydrolase. This enzyme is also called gamma-lactonase. This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, calcium.
Structural studies
