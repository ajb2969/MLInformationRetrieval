   Minimal subtraction scheme      Minimal subtraction scheme   In quantum field theory , the minimal subtraction scheme , or MS scheme , is a particular renormalization scheme used to absorb the infinities that arise in perturbative calculations beyond leading order , introduced independently by  and . The MS scheme consists of absorbing only the divergent part of the radiative corrections into the counterterms.  In the similar and more widely used modified minimal subtraction , or MS-bar scheme (    MS  ¯     normal-¯  MS    \overline{\text{MS}}   ), one absorbs the divergent part plus a universal constant (which always arises along with the divergence in Feynman diagram calculations) into the counterterms.  When using dimensional regularization , i.e.      d  4   p   →    μ   4  -  d     d  d   p      normal-→     superscript  d  4   p      superscript  μ    4  d     superscript  d  d   p     d^{4}p\to\mu^{4-d}d^{d}p   , it is implemented by rescaling the renormalization scale     μ  2   →    μ  2     e   γ  E     4  π        normal-→   superscript  μ  2      superscript  μ  2      superscript  e   subscript  γ  E      4  π       \mu^{2}\to\mu^{2}\frac{e^{\gamma_{E}}}{4\pi}   , with    γ  E     subscript  γ  E    \gamma_{E}   the Euler–Mascheroni constant .
