Minimal subtraction scheme

In quantum field theory, the minimal subtraction scheme, or MS scheme, is a particular renormalization scheme used to absorb the infinities that arise in perturbative calculations beyond leading order, introduced independently by  and . The MS scheme consists of absorbing only the divergent part of the radiative corrections into the counterterms.
In the similar and more widely used modified minimal subtraction, or MS-bar scheme (
 
 
 
 ), one absorbs the divergent part plus a universal constant (which always arises along with the divergence in Feynman diagram calculations) into the counterterms.
When using dimensional regularization, i.e. 
 
 
 
 , it is implemented by rescaling the renormalization scale
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 
  the Eulerâ€“Mascheroni constant.
