   Catalan's triangle      Catalan's triangle   In combinatorial mathematics , Catalan's triangle is a number triangle whose entries    C   (  n  ,  k  )       C   n  k     C(n,k)   give the number of strings consisting of n X's and k Y's such that no initial segment of the string has more Y's than X's. It is a generalization of the Catalan numbers , and is named after Eugène Charles Catalan .  Some values are given by 1        n \ k   0   1   2   3   4   5   6   7   8       0   1             1   1   1            2   1   2   2           3   1   3   5   5          4   1   4   9   14   14         5   1   5   14   28   42   42        6   1   6   20   48   90   132   132       7   1   7   27   75   165   297   429   429      8   1   8   35   110   275   572   1001   1430   1430       Each element is the sum of the one above and the one to the left. The diagonal    C   (  n  ,  n  )       C   n  n     C(n,n)   consists of the Catalan numbers .  General formula  The general formula for    C   (  n  ,  k  )       C   n  k     C(n,k)   is given by 2       C   (  n  ,  k  )    =      (   n  +  k   )   !    (    n  -  k   +  1   )      k  !

Generalization  Catalan's trapezoids are a countable set of number trapezoids which generalize Catalan’s triangle. Catalan's trapezoid of order m=1,2,3,... is a number trapezoid whose entries     C  m    (  n  ,  k  )        subscript  C  m    n  k     C_{m}(n,k)   give the number of strings consisting of n X's and k Y's such that in every initial segment of the string the number of Y's does not exceed the number of X's by m or more. 3 By definition, Catalan's trapezoid of order m=1 is Catalan's triangle, i.e.,      C  1    (  n  ,  k  )    =   C   (  n  ,  k  )           subscript  C  1    n  k      C   n  k      C_{1}(n,k)=C(n,k)   .
