In mathematics, arg is a function operating on complex numbers (visualized in a complex plane). It gives the angle between the positive real axis to the line joining the point to the origin, shown as 
 
 
 
  in figure 1, known as an argument of the point.
Definition
(Figure)
Figure 3. Two choices for the argument 
 
 


An argument of the complex number 
 
 
 
 , denoted 
 
 
 
 , is defined in two equivalent ways:

Geometrically, in the complex plane, as the angle

 
  from the positive real axis to the vector representing 
 
 
 
 . The numeric value is given by the angle in radians and is positive if measured counterclockwise.
Algebraically, as any real quantity 
 
 
 
  such that








for some positive real 
 
 
 
 . The quantity 
 
 
 
  is the modulus of 
 
 
 
 , denoted |
 
 
 
 |:
 
 




The names amplitude1 for the modulus and phase2 for the argument are sometimes used equivalently.
Under both definitions, it can be seen that the argument of any (non-zero) complex number has many possible values: firstly, as a geometrical angle, it is clear that whole circle rotations do not change the point, so angles differing by an integer multiple of 
 
 
radians (a complete circle) are the same. Similarly, from the periodicity of 

 and 

, the second definition also has this property.
Principal value
(Figure)
Figure 4. The principal value 
 
 
 
  of the blue point at 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . The red line here is the branch cut and corresponds to the two red lines in figure 2 seen vertically above each other).

Because a complete rotation around 0 leaves a complex number unchanged, there are many choices which could be made for 
 
 
 
  by circling the origin any number of times. This is shown in figure 3, a representation of the multi-valued (set-valued) function, where a vertical line cuts the surface at heights representing all the possible choices of angle for that point.
When a well-defined function is required then the usual choice, known as the principal value, is the value in the open-closed interval

 
 , that is from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
radians, excluding 
 
 
 
  rad itself (equivalently from −180 to +180 degrees, excluding −180° itself). This represents an angle of up to half a complete circle from the positive real axis in either direction.
Some authors define the range of the principal value as being in the closed-open interval 
 
 
 
 .
Notation
The principal value sometimes has the initial letter capitalized as in 
 
 
 
 , especially when a general version of the argument is also being considered. Note that notation varies, so 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  may be interchanged in different texts.
The set of all possible values of the argument can be written in terms of 
 
 
 
  as:



Covering space
(Figure)
Figure 2. The arguments of the complex plane are plotted vertically. 
 
 
 
  measures the angle of points, shown by the fact that the outward radial lines, which have constant angle to the real axis, lie on the surface. The layered structure shows that each point has infinitely many arguments, each one corresponding an intersection between a vertical line through the point and the sheet. The red hatching indicates the surface corresponding to the principal value. See larger version.

In informal situations, 
 
 
 
  may be left not well-defined, for instance 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  depends on a parameter 
 
 
 
  may change by 
 
 
 
  every time 
 
 
 
  goes around the origin. This idea can be made more precise by considering 
 
 
 
  as being defined not on the complex plane but on a covering space. Polar coordinates excluding the origin and with an unconstrained angle provide such a space, in this case 
 
 
 
  is defined by



The covering space is equivalent to the punctured complex plane:


 
  and has as base space the product of a positive non-zero radius and an angle on the unit circle:



The principal value 
 
 
 
  then maps the covering space of this representation to the interval 
 
 
 
 :



Computation
The principal value 
 
 
 
  of a complex number given as 
 
 
 
  is normally available in math libraries of many programming languages using the function [[atan2]] or some language specific variant. The value of 
 
 
 
  is the principal value in the range 
 
 
 
 
 .
Many texts say the value is given by 
 
 
 
 , as 
 
 
 
  is slope, and 
 
 
 
  converts slope to angle. This is correct only when 
 
 
 
 , so the quotient is defined and the angle lies between 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , but extending this definition to cases where 
 
 
 
  is not positive is relatively involved. Specifically, one may define the principal value of the argument separately on the two half-planes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 




For the variant where 
 
 
 
  is defined to lie in the interval 
 
 
 
 , the value can be found by adding 
 
 
 
  to the value above when it is negative.
Alternatively, the principal value can be calculated in a uniform way using the tangent half-angle formula, the function being defined over the complex plane but excluding the origin:


 
  This is based on a parametrization of the circle (except for the negative 
 
 
 
 -axis) by rational functions. This version of 
 
 
 
  is not stable enough for floating point computational use (it may overflow near the region 
 
 

A variant of the last formula which avoids overflow is sometimes used in high precision computation:



Identities
One of the main motivations for defining the principal value 
 
 
 
  is to be able to write complex numbers in modulus-argument form. Hence for any complex number 
 
 
 
 ,



This is only really valid if $z$ is non-zero but can be considered as valid also for $ z = 0$ if $Arg(0)$ is considered as being an indeterminate form rather than as being undefined.
Some further identities follow. If  and  are two non-zero complex numbers, then
$$\operatorname{Arg}(z_1  z_2) \equiv \operatorname{Arg}(z_1) + \operatorname{Arg}(z_2) \pmod{(-\pi,\pi]},$$
$$\operatorname{Arg}\biggl(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\biggr) \equiv \operatorname{Arg}(z_1) - \operatorname{Arg}(z_2) \pmod{(-\pi,\pi]}.$$
If $z ≠ 0$ and $n$ is any integer, then
$$\operatorname{Arg}\left(z^n\right) \equiv n \operatorname{Arg}(z) \pmod {(-\pi,\pi]}.$$
Example
$$\operatorname{Arg}\biggl(\frac{-1- i}{i}\biggr) = \operatorname{Arg}(-1 - i) - \operatorname{Arg}(i) = -\frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{2} = -\frac{5\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4} \pmod {(-\pi,\pi]}.$$
