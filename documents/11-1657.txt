   Argument (complex analysis)      Argument (complex analysis)   (Figure)  Figure 1. This Argand diagram represents the complex numbers lying on a plane . For each point on the plane,    a  r  g      a  r  g    arg   is the function which returns the angle   φ   φ   φ   .   In mathematics , arg is a function operating on complex numbers (visualized in a complex plane ). It gives the angle between the positive real  axis to the line joining the point to the origin, shown as   φ   φ   φ   in figure 1, known as an argument of the point.  Definition  (Figure)  Figure 3. Two choices for the argument   φ   φ   φ      An argument of the complex number    z  =   x  +   i  y        z    x    i  y      z=x+iy   , denoted    a  r  g  z      a  r  g  z    argz   , is defined in two equivalent ways:   Geometrically, in the complex plane , as the angle    φ   φ   φ   from the positive real axis to the vector representing   z   z   z   . The numeric value is given by the angle in radians and is positive if measured counterclockwise.  Algebraically, as any real quantity   φ   φ   φ   such that         z  =   r   (    cos  φ   +   i   sin  φ     )        z    r      φ     i    φ        z=r(\cos\varphi+i\sin\varphi)       for some positive real   r   r   r   . The quantity   r   r   r   is the modulus of   z   z   z   , denoted |   z   z   z   |:      r  =     x  2   +   y  2      .      r       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       r=\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}.       The names amplitude 1 for the modulus and phase 2 for the argument are sometimes used equivalently.  Under both definitions, it can be seen that the argument of any (non-zero) complex number has many possible values: firstly, as a geometrical angle, it is clear that whole circle rotations do not change the point, so angles differing by an integer multiple of    2  π      2  π    2π    radians (a complete circle) are the same. Similarly, from the periodicity of     s  i  n      s  i  n    sin    and     c  o  s      c  o  s    cos    , the second definition also has this property.  Principal value  (Figure)  Figure 4. The principal value    A  r  g      A  r  g    Arg   of the blue point at    1  +  i      1  i    1+i   is    π  /  4      π  4    π/4   . The red line here is the branch cut and corresponds to the two red lines in figure 2 seen vertically above each other).   Because a complete rotation around 0 leaves a complex number unchanged, there are many choices which could be made for   φ   φ   φ   by circling the origin any number of times. This is shown in figure 3, a representation of the multi-valued (set-valued) function, where a vertical line cuts the surface at heights representing all the possible choices of angle for that point.  When a well-defined function is required then the usual choice, known as the principal value , is the value in the open-closed interval     (   −  π  r  a  d   ,   π  r  a  d   ]       normal-−  π  r  a  d     π  r  a  d     (−πrad,πrad]   , that is from    −  π      normal-−  π    −π   to   π   π   π    radians , excluding    −  π      normal-−  π    −π   rad itself (equivalently from −180 to +180 degrees , excluding −180° itself). This represents an angle of up to half a complete circle from the positive real axis in either direction.  Some authors define the range of the principal value as being in the closed-open interval    [  0  ,   2  π   )     0    2  π     [0,2π)   .  Notation  The principal value sometimes has the initial letter capitalized as in    A  r  g  z      A  r  g  z    Argz   , especially when a general version of the argument is also being considered. Note that notation varies, so    a  r  g      a  r  g    arg   and    A  r  g      A  r  g    Arg   may be interchanged in different texts.  The set of all possible values of the argument can be written in terms of    A  r  g      A  r  g    Arg   as:        arg  z   =   {    Arg  z   +   2  π   n     |   n  ∈  ℤ   }    .        z    conditional-set     Arg  z     2  π  n      n  ℤ      \arg z=\{\operatorname{Arg}z+2\pi n\;|\;n\in\mathbb{Z}\}.     Covering space  (Figure)  Figure 2. The arguments of the complex plane are plotted vertically.    a  r  g      a  r  g    arg   measures the angle of points, shown by the fact that the outward radial lines, which have constant angle to the real axis, lie on the surface. The layered structure shows that each point has infinitely many arguments, each one corresponding an intersection between a vertical line through the point and the sheet. The red hatching indicates the surface corresponding to the principal value. See larger version .   In informal situations,    a  r  g      a  r  g    arg   may be left not well-defined, for instance    a  r  g  z   (  t  )       a  r  g  z  t    argz(t)   where   z   z   z   depends on a parameter   t   t   t   may change by    2  π      2  π    2π   every time   z   z   z   goes around the origin. This idea can be made more precise by considering    z   (  t  )       z  t    z(t)   as being defined not on the complex plane but on a covering space . Polar coordinates excluding the origin and with an unconstrained angle provide such a space, in this case    a  r  g      a  r  g    arg   is defined by      arg  :    ℝ  +   ∖    {  0  }   ×  ℝ       normal-:      superscript  ℝ       0   ℝ      \displaystyle\arg:\mathbb{R}^{+}\smallsetminus\{0\}\times\mathbb{R}     The covering space is equivalent to the punctured complex plane:      ℂ  ∖   {  0  }       ℂ   0     \mathbb{C}\smallsetminus\{0\}   and has as base space the product of a positive non-zero radius and an angle on the unit circle :        ℝ  +   ∖    {  0  }   ×   𝕊  1     .       superscript  ℝ       0    superscript  𝕊  1      \mathbb{R}^{+}\smallsetminus\{0\}\times\mathbb{S}^{1}.     The principal value    A  r  g      A  r  g    Arg   then maps the covering space of this representation to the interval    (   −  π   ,  π  ]       normal-−  π   π    (−π,π]   :      Arg  :    ℝ  +   ∖    {  0  }   ×  ℝ       normal-:  Arg     superscript  ℝ       0   ℝ      \displaystyle\operatorname{Arg}:\mathbb{R}^{+}\smallsetminus\{0\}\times\mathbb%
 {R}     Computation  The principal value    A  r  g      A  r  g    Arg   of a complex number given as    x  +   i  y       x    i  y     x+iy   is normally available in math libraries of many programming languages using the function [[atan2]] or some language specific variant. The value of    a  t  a  n  2   (  y  ,  x  )       a  t  a  n  2   y  x     atan2(y,x)   is the principal value in the range    (   −  π   ,  π  ]       normal-−  π   π    (−π,π]   .  Many texts say the value is given by    a  r  c  t  a  n   (   y  /  x   )       a  r  c  t  a  n    y  x     arctan(y/x)   , as    y  /  x      y  x    y/x   is slope, and    a  r  c  t  a  n      a  r  c  t  a  n    arctan   converts slope to angle. This is correct only when    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   , so the quotient is defined and the angle lies between     −  π   /  2        normal-−  π   2    −π/2   and    π  /  2      π  2    π/2   , but extending this definition to cases where   x   x   x   is not positive is relatively involved. Specifically, one may define the principal value of the argument separately on the two half-planes    x  >  0      x  0    x>0   and   x   x   x         A  r  g      A  r  g    Arg     For the variant where   z   z   z   is defined to lie in the interval     z  =    |  z  |    e   i   Arg  z       .      z      z    superscript  e    i   Arg  z        z=\left|z\right|e^{i\operatorname{Arg}z}.   , the value can be found by adding   z   z   z   to the value above when it is negative.  Alternatively, the principal value can be calculated in a uniform way using the tangent half-angle formula , the function being defined over the complex plane but excluding the origin:      z  =  0      z  0    z=0   This is based on a parametrization of the circle (except for the negative    A  r  g   (  0  )       A  r  g  0    Arg(0)   -axis) by rational functions. This version of      Arg   (    z  1    z  2    )    ≡     Arg   (   z  1   )    +   Arg   (   z  2   )        (   mod   (   -  π   ,  π  ]    )     ,       Arg     subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2      annotated     Arg   subscript  z  1     Arg   subscript  z  2      pmod     π   π       \operatorname{Arg}(z_{1}z_{2})\equiv\operatorname{Arg}(z_{1})+\operatorname{%
 Arg}(z_{2})\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}(-\pi,\pi]),   is not stable enough for floating point computational use (it may overflow near the region      Arg   (    z  1    z  2    )    ≡     Arg   (   z  1   )    -   Arg   (   z  2   )        (   mod   (   -  π   ,  π  ]    )     .

 {1})-\operatorname{Arg}(z_{2})\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}(-\pi,\pi]).     A variant of the last formula which avoids overflow is sometimes used in high precision computation:      z  ≠  0      z  normal-≠  0    z≠0     Identities  One of the main motivations for defining the principal value   n   n   n   is to be able to write complex numbers in modulus-argument form. Hence for any complex number      Arg   (   z  n   )    ≡    n   Arg   (  z  )        (   mod   (   -  π   ,  π  ]    )     .

Arg        1   i   i       Arg      1   i     Arg  i                 3  π   4      π  2               5  π   4          annotated      3  π   4    pmod     π   π        \operatorname{Arg}\biggl(\frac{-1-i}{i}\biggr)=\operatorname{Arg}(-1-i)-%
 \operatorname{Arg}(i)=-\frac{3\pi}{4}-\frac{\pi}{2}=-\frac{5\pi}{4}=\frac{3\pi%
 }{4}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}(-\pi,\pi]).     This is only really valid if $z$ is non-zero but can be considered as valid also for $ z = 0$ if $Arg(0)$ is considered as being an indeterminate form rather than as being undefined.  Some further identities follow. If and are two non-zero complex numbers, then  $$\operatorname{Arg}(z_1  z_2) \equiv \operatorname{Arg}(z_1) + \operatorname{Arg}(z_2) \pmod{(-\pi,\pi]},$$  $$\operatorname{Arg}\biggl(\frac{z_1}{z_2}\biggr) \equiv \operatorname{Arg}(z_1) - \operatorname{Arg}(z_2) \pmod{(-\pi,\pi]}.$$  If $z ≠ 0$ and $n$ is any integer, then  $$\operatorname{Arg}\left(z^n\right) \equiv n \operatorname{Arg}(z) \pmod {(-\pi,\pi]}.$$  Example  $$\operatorname{Arg}\biggl(\frac{-1- i}{i}\biggr) = \operatorname{Arg}(-1 - i) - \operatorname{Arg}(i) = -\frac{3\pi}{4} - \frac{\pi}{2} = -\frac{5\pi}{4} = \frac{3\pi}{4} \pmod {(-\pi,\pi]}.$$  References  Notes  Bibliography       External links     "  Category:Trigonometry  Category:Complex analysis  Category:Signal processing     ↩  Dictionary of Mathematics (2002). phase . ↩
