   Vetispiradiene synthase      Vetispiradiene synthase   In enzymology , a vetispiradiene synthase () is an enzyme of Egyptian henbane that catalyzes the following chemical reaction :   trans,trans-farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   vetispiradiene + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , trans,trans-farnesyl diphosphate , and two products , vetispiradiene and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trans,trans-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, vetispiradiene-forming) . Other names in common use include vetispiradiene-forming farnesyl pyrophosphate cyclase , pemnaspirodiene synthase , HVS , and vetispiradiene cyclase . This enzyme participates in terpenoid biosynthesis .  References         "  Category:EC 4.2.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
