   Irrational rotation      Irrational rotation   In the mathematical theory of dynamical systems , an irrational rotation is a map       T  θ   :     [  0  ,  1  ]   →   [  0  ,  1  ]    ,     T  θ    (  x  )    ≜    x  +  θ   mod  1        normal-:   subscript  T  θ    formulae-sequence   normal-→   0  1    0  1     normal-≜     subscript  T  θ   x    modulo    x  θ   1       T_{\theta}:[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1],\quad T_{\theta}(x)\triangleq x+\theta\mod 1     where θ is an irrational number . Under the identification of a circle with R / Z , or with the interval [0, 1] with the boundary points glued together, this map becomes a rotation of a circle by a proportion θ of a full revolution (i.e., an angle of 2 πθ radians). Since θ is irrational, the rotation has infinite order in the circle group and the map T θ has no periodic orbits .  Alternatively, we can use multiplicative notation for an irrational rotation by introducing the map       T  θ   :     S  1   →   S  1    ,     T  θ    (  x  )    =   x   e   2  π  i  θ          normal-:   subscript  T  θ    formulae-sequence   normal-→   superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1         subscript  T  θ   x     x   superscript  e    2  π  i  θ         T_{\theta}:S^{1}\to S^{1},\quad\quad\quad T_{\theta}(x)=xe^{2\pi i\theta}     The relationship between the additive and multiplicative notations is the group isomorphism      ϕ  :     (   [  0  ,  1  ]   ,  +  )   →   (   S  1   ,  ⋅  )      ϕ   (  x  )    =   x   e   2  π  i  θ          normal-:  ϕ   formulae-sequence   normal-→    0  1       superscript  S  1   normal-⋅        ϕ  x     x   superscript  e    2  π  i  θ         \phi:([0,1],+)\to(S^{1},\cdot)\quad\phi(x)=xe^{2\pi i\theta}   .  It can be shown that is an isometry .  There is a strong distinction in circle rotations that depends on whether is rational or irrational. Rational rotations are less interesting examples of dynamical systems due to the fact that if    θ  =   a  b       θ    a  b     \theta=\frac{a}{b}   and     gcd   (  a  ,  b  )    =  1        a  b   1    \gcd(a,b)=1   , then      T  θ  b    (  x  )    =  x         superscript   subscript  T  θ   b   x   x    T_{\theta}^{b}(x)=x   when    x   \isin    [  0  ,  1  ]       x  \isin   0  1     x\isin[0,1]   . It can also be shown that      T  θ  i    (  x  )    ≠  x         superscript   subscript  T  θ   i   x   x    T_{\theta}^{i}(x)\neq x   when    1  ≤  i  <  b        1  i       b     1\leq i   .  Significance  Irrational rotations form a fundamental example in the theory of dynamical systems . According to the Denjoy theorem , every orientation-preserving -diffeomorphism of the circle with an irrational rotation number  is topologically conjugate to . An irrational rotation is a measure-preserving  ergodic transformation , but it is not mixing . The Poincaré map for the dynamical system associated with the Kronecker foliation on a torus with angle is the irrational rotation by . C*-algebras associated with irrational rotations, known as irrational rotation algebras , have been extensively studied.  Properties   If is irrational, then the orbit of element of    0  ,  11     0  11    0,11   under the rotation is dense in    0  ,  11     0  11    0,11   . Therefore, irrational rotations are topologically transitive .  If is irrational, then is uniquely ergodic .  Irrational (and rational) rotations are not topologically mixing .  Irrational rotations are ergodic with respect to the Lebesgue measure.  Irrational rotations are uniquely ergodic, with the Lebesgue measure serving as the unique invariant probability measure.

 t))=b-a   .   Generalizations   Circle rotations are examples of group translations .  For a general orientation preserving homomorphism of to itself we call a homeomorphism    F  :   ℝ  →  ℝ      normal-:  F   normal-→  ℝ  ℝ     F:\mathbb{R}\to\mathbb{R}   a lift of if     π  ∘  F   =   f  ∘  π         π  F     f  π     \pi\circ F=f\circ\pi   where     π   (  t  )    =   t  mod  1         π  t    modulo  t  1     \pi(t)=t\bmod 1   . 1   Applications   Skew Products over Rotations of the Circle: In 1969 2  William A. Veech constructed examples of minimal and not uniquely ergodic dynamical systems as follows: "Take two copies of the unit circle and mark off segment of length in the counterclockwise direction on each one with endpoint at 0. Now take irrational and consider the following dynamical system. Start with a point , say in the first circle. Rotate counterclockwise by until the first time the orbit lands in ; then switch to the corresponding point in the second circle, rotate by until the first time the point lands in ; switch back to the first circle and so forth. Veech showed that if is irrational, then there exists irrational for which this system is minimal and the Lebesgue measure is not uniquely ergodic." 3   See also   Bernoulli map  Modular arithmetic  Siegel disc  Toeplitz algebra  Phase locking (circle map)   References   4  5 }}  Further reading   C.
