List of logic systems

This article contains a list of sample Hilbert-style deductive systems for propositional logic.
Classical propositional calculus systems
Classical propositional calculus is the standard propositional logic. Its intended semantics is bivalent and its main property is that it is syntactically complete, otherwise said that no new axiom not already consequence of the existing axioms can be added without making the logic inconsistent. Many different equivalent complete axiom systems have been formulated. They differ in the choice of basic connectives used, which in all cases have to be functionally complete (i.e. able to express by composition all n-ary truth tables), and in the exact complete choice of axioms over the chosen basis of connectives.
Implication and negation
The formulations here use implication and negation 
 
 
 
  as functionally complete set of basic connectives. Every logic system requires at least one non-nullary rule of inference. Classical propositional calculus typically uses the rule of modus ponens:


 
  We assume this rule is included in all systems below unless stated otherwise.

  of connectives.

Negation and disjunction
Instead of implication, classical logic can also be formulated using the functionally complete set 
 
 
 
  of connectives. These formulations use the following rule of inference;

Dually, classical propositional logic can be defined using only conjunction and negation.
Sheffer's stroke
Because Sheffer's stroke (also known as NAND operator) is functionally complete, it can be used to create an entire formulation of propositional calculus. NAND formulations use a rule of inference called Nicod's modus ponens:

Implicational propositional calculus
The implicational propositional calculus is the fragment of the classical propositional calculus which only admits the implication connective. It is not functionally complete (because it lacks the ability to express falsity and negation) but it is however syntactically complete. The implicational calculi below use modus ponens as an inference rule.

Łukasiewicz's axiom system:



Intuitionistic and intermediate logics
Intuitionistic logic is a subsystem of classical logic. It is commonly formulated with 
 
 
 
  as the set of (functionally complete) basic connectives. It is not syntactically complete since it lacks excluded middle A∨¬A or Peirce's law ((A→B)→A)→A which can be added without making the logic inconsistent. It has modus ponens as inference rule, and the following axioms:


























 
  Alternatively, intuitionistic logic may be axiomatized using 
 
 
 
  as the set of basic connectives, replacing the last axiom with






Intermediate logics are in between intuitionistic logic and classical logic. Here are a few intermediate logics:

Jankov logic (KC) is an extension of intuitionistic logic, which can be axiomatized by the intuitionistic axiom system plus the axiom19





Gödel–Dummett logic (LC) can be axiomatized over intuitionistic logic by adding the axiom20




Positive implicational calculus

Positive propositional calculus
Positive propositional calculus is the fragment of intuitionistic logic using only the (non functionally complete) connectives 
 
 
 
 . It can be axiomatized by any of the above-mentioned calculi for positive implicational calculus together with the axioms

















 
  Optionally, we may also include the connective 
 
 
 
  and the axioms









Johansson's minimal logic can be axiomatized by any of the axiom systems for positive propositional calculus and expanding its language with the nullary connective 
 
 
 
 , with no additional axiom schemas. Alternatively, it can also be axiomatized in the language 
 
 
 
  by expanding the positive propositional calculus with the axiom


 
  or the pair of axioms






Intuitionistic logic in language with negation can be axiomatized over the positive calculus by the pair of axioms





 
  or the pair of axioms22






Classical logic in the language 
 
 
 
  can be obtained from the positive propositional calculus by adding the axiom


 
  or the pair of axioms






Fitch calculus takes any of the axiom systems for positive propositional calculus and adds the axioms23











 
  Note that the first and third axioms are also valid in intuitionistic logic.
Equivalential calculus
Equivalential calculus is the subsystem of classical propositional calculus that only allows the (functionally incomplete) equivalence connective, denoted here as
