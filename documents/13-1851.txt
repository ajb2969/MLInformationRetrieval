   Secondary plot (kinetics)      Secondary plot (kinetics)   In enzyme kinetics , a secondary plot uses the intercept or slope from several Lineweaver-Burk plots to find additional kinetic constants.  For example, when a set of v by [S] curves from an enzyme with a ping–pong mechanism (varying substrate A, fixed substrate B) are plotted in a Lineweaver–Burk plot , a set of parallel lines will be produced.  The following Michaelis–Menten equation relates the initial reaction rate v 0 to the substrate concentrations [A] and [B]:       1   v  0        1   subscript  v  0     \displaystyle\frac{1}{v_{0}}   The y-intercept of this equation is equal to the following:      y-intercept  =      K  M  B     v  max    [  B  ]      +    1   v  max          y-intercept       superscript   subscript  K  M   B      subscript  v     delimited-[]  B       1   subscript  v        \displaystyle\mbox{y-intercept}=\frac{K_{M}^{B}}{v_{\max}{[}B{]}}+\frac{1}{v_{%
 \max}}   The y-intercept is determined at several different fixed concentrations of substrate B (and varying substrate A). The y-intercept values are then plotted versus 1/[B] to determine the Michaelis constant for substrate B,    K  M  B     superscript   subscript  K  M   B    K_{M}^{B}   , as shown in the Figure to the right. The slope is equal to    K  M  B     superscript   subscript  K  M   B    K_{M}^{B}   divided by    v  max     subscript  v     v_{\max}   and the intercept is equal to 1 over    v  max     subscript  v     v_{\max}   .

For a competitive enzyme inhibitor , the apparent Michaelis constant is equal to the following:       apparent   K  m    =    K  m   ×   (   1  +     [  I  ]    K  I      )          apparent   subscript  K  m       subscript  K  m     1     delimited-[]  I    subscript  K  I        \displaystyle\mbox{apparent }K_{m}=K_{m}\times\left(1+\frac{[I]}{K_{I}}\right)     The slope of the Lineweaver-Burk plot is therefore equal to:      slope  =      K  m    v  max     ×   (   1  +     [  I  ]    K  I      )        slope       subscript  K  m    subscript  v       1     delimited-[]  I    subscript  K  I        \displaystyle\mbox{slope}=\frac{K_{m}}{v_{\max}}\times\left(1+\frac{[I]}{K_{I}%
 }\right)     If one creates a secondary plot consisting of the slope values from several Lineweaver-Burk plots of varying inhibitor concentration [I], the competitive inhbition constant may be found. The slope of the secondary plot divided by the intercept is equal to 1/k I . This method allows one to find the k I constant, even when the Michaelis constant and v max values are not known.
