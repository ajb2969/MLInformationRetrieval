   Malgrange–Ehrenpreis theorem      Malgrange–Ehrenpreis theorem   In mathematics, the Malgrange–Ehrenpreis theorem states that every non-zero linear differential operator with constant coefficients has a Green's function . It was first proved independently by  and .  This means that the differential equation        P   (   ∂   ∂   x  1     ,  ⋯  ,   ∂   ∂   x  ℓ     )   u   (  𝐱  )    =   δ   (  𝐱  )     ,        P         subscript  x  1     normal-⋯        subscript  x  normal-ℓ      u  𝐱     δ  𝐱     P\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}},\cdots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\ell%
 }}\right)u(\mathbf{x})=\delta(\mathbf{x}),     where P is a polynomial in several variables and δ is the Dirac delta function , has a distributional solution u . It can be used to show that       P   (   ∂   ∂   x  1     ,  ⋯  ,   ∂   ∂   x  ℓ     )   u   (  𝐱  )    =   f   (  𝐱  )          P         subscript  x  1     normal-⋯        subscript  x  normal-ℓ      u  𝐱     f  𝐱     P\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{1}},\cdots,\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{\ell%
 }}\right)u(\mathbf{x})=f(\mathbf{x})     has a solution for any distribution f . The solution is not unique in general.  The analogue for differential operators whose coefficients are polynomials (rather than constants) is false: see Lewy's example .  Proofs  The original proofs of Malgrange and Ehrenpreis were non-constructive as they used the Hahn–Banach theorem . Since then several constructive proofs have been found.  There is a very short proof using the Fourier transform and the Bernstein–Sato polynomial , as follows. By taking Fourier transforms the Malgrange–Ehrenpreis theorem is equivalent to the fact that every non-zero polynomial P has a distributional inverse. By replacing P by the product with its complex conjugate, one can also assume that P is non-negative. For non-negative polynomials P the existence of a distributional inverse follows from the existence of the Bernstein–Sato polynomial, which implies that P s can be analytically continued as a meromorphic distribution-valued function of the complex variable s ; the constant term of the Laurent expansion of P s at s = −1 is then a distributional inverse of P .  Other proofs, often giving better bounds on the growth of a solution, are given in ,  and .  gives a detailed discussion of the regularity properties of the fundamental solutions.  A short constructive proof was presented in :      E  =    1     P  m    (   2  η   )    ¯      ∑   j  =  0   m     a  j    e    λ  j   η  x     ℱ  ξ   -  1     (     P   (    i  ξ   +    λ  j   η    )    ¯    P   (    i  ξ   +    λ  j   η    )     )          E      1   normal-¯     subscript  P  m     2  η        superscript   subscript     j  0    m      subscript  a  j    superscript  e     subscript  λ  j   η  x     subscript   superscript  ℱ    1    ξ      normal-¯    P      i  ξ      subscript  λ  j   η        P      i  ξ      subscript  λ  j   η           E=\frac{1}{\overline{P_{m}(2\eta)}}\sum_{j=0}^{m}a_{j}e^{\lambda_{j}\eta x}%

 \lambda_{j}\eta)}\right)     is a fundamental solution of P (∂), i.e., P (∂) E = δ, if P m is the principal part of P , η ∈ R n with P m (η) ≠ 0, the real numbers λ 0 , ..., λ m are pairwise different, and        a  j   =    ∏    k  =  0   ,   k  ≠  j    m     (    λ  j   -   λ  k    )    -  1      .       subscript  a  j     superscript   subscript  product   formulae-sequence    k  0     k  j     m    superscript     subscript  λ  j    subscript  λ  k      1       a_{j}=\prod_{k=0,k\neq j}^{m}(\lambda_{j}-\lambda_{k})^{-1}.
