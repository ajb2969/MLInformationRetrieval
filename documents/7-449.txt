   Isothermal–isobaric ensemble      Isothermal–isobaric ensemble   The isothermal–isobaric ensemble (constant temperature and constant pressure ensemble) is a statistical mechanical ensemble that maintains constant temperature    T    T   T\,   and constant pressure    P    P   P\,   applied. It is also called the    N  p  T      N  p  T    NpT   -ensemble, where the number of particles    N    N   N\,   is also kept as a constant. This ensemble plays an important role in chemistry as chemical reactions are usually carried out under constant pressure condition. 1 The partition function can be written as the weighted sum of the partition function of canonical ensemble ,    Z   (  N  ,  V  ,  T  )       Z   N  V  T     Z(N,V,T)\,   .        Δ   (  N  ,  P  ,  T  )    =   ∫   Z   (  N  ,  V  ,  T  )    exp   (   -   β  P  V    )    C  d  V     .        normal-Δ   N  P  T        Z   N  V  T         β  P  V     C  d  V      \Delta(N,P,T)=\int Z(N,V,T)\exp(-\beta PV)CdV.\,\;     where    β  =    1  /   k  B     T        β      1   subscript  k  B    T     \beta=1/k_{B}T\,   (     k  B      subscript  k  B    k_{B}\,   is the Boltzmann constant ), and    V    V   V\,   is volume of the system.  There are several candidates for the normalization factor    C    C   C\,   , e.g.,    C  =   N  /   V        C    N  V     C=N/V\,   , or    C  =   β   P        C    β  P     C=\beta P\,   . These choices make the partition function a nondimensional quantity. The differences vanish in the thermodynamic limit , i.e., in the limit of infinite number of particles.  The characteristic state function of this ensemble is the Gibbs free energy ,       G   (  N  ,  P  ,  T  )    =   -    k  B   T   ln  Δ    (  N  ,  P  ,  T  )           G   N  P  T         subscript  k  B   T    normal-Δ    N  P  T       G(N,P,T)=-k_{B}T\ln\Delta(N,P,T)\;\,     This thermodynamic potential is related to the Helmholtz free energy (logarithm of the canonical partition function),    F    F   F\,   , in the following way: 2       G  =   F  +   P  V     .      G    F    P  V      G=F+PV.\;\,     References  "  Category:Statistical ensembles     ↩
