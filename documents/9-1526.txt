Antiparallel (mathematics)

In geometry, anti-parallel lines can be defined with respect to either lines or angles.
Definitions
Given two lines 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , lines 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are anti-parallel with respect to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  in Fig.1. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are anti-parallel with respect to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are also anti-parallel with respect to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
In any quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, any two opposite sides are anti-parallel with respect to the other two sides (Fig.2).
Two lines 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are antiparallel with respect to the sides of an angle if and only if they make the same angle 
 
 
 
  in the opposite senses with the bisector of that angle (Fig.3).

Fig.1: Given two lines 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , lines 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are anti-parallel with respect to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  if

(Figure)
Fig.3: Two lines 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are said to be antiparallel with respect to the sides of an angle if they make the same angle 
 
 
 
  in the opposite senses with the bisector of that angle. Notice that our previous angles 1 and 2 are still equivalent. 

(Figure)
Fig.4: If the lines 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  coincide, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are said to be anti-parallel with respect to a straight line.




Antiparallel vectors
In a Euclidean space, two directed line segments, often called vectors in applied mathematics, are antiparallel, if they are supported by parallel lines and have opposite directions.1 In that case, one of the associated Euclidean vectors is the product of the other by a negative number.
Relations

The line joining the feet to two altitudes of a triangle is antiparallel to the third side.(any cevians which 'see' the third side with the same angle create antiparallel lines)
The tangent to a triangle's circumcircle at a vertex is antiparallel to the opposite side.
The radius of the circumcircle at a vertex is perpendicular to all lines antiparallel to the opposite sides.
