   Antiparallel (mathematics)      Antiparallel (mathematics)   In geometry , anti-parallel lines can be defined with respect to either lines or angles.  Definitions  Given two lines     m  1      subscript  m  1    m_{1}\,   and     m  2      subscript  m  2    m_{2}\,   , lines     l  1      subscript  l  1    l_{1}\,   and     l  2      subscript  l  2    l_{2}\,   are anti-parallel with respect to     m  1      subscript  m  1    m_{1}\,   and     m  2      subscript  m  2    m_{2}\,   if     ∠  1   =   ∠   2          normal-∠  1     normal-∠  2     \angle 1=\angle 2\,   in Fig.1. If     l  1      subscript  l  1    l_{1}\,   and     l  2      subscript  l  2    l_{2}\,   are anti-parallel with respect to     m  1      subscript  m  1    m_{1}\,   and     m  2      subscript  m  2    m_{2}\,   , then     m  1      subscript  m  1    m_{1}\,   and     m  2      subscript  m  2    m_{2}\,   are also anti-parallel with respect to     l  1      subscript  l  1    l_{1}\,   and     l  2      subscript  l  2    l_{2}\,   .  In any quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, any two opposite sides are anti-parallel with respect to the other two sides (Fig.2).  Two lines    l  1     subscript  l  1    l_{1}   and    l  2     subscript  l  2    l_{2}   are antiparallel with respect to the sides of an angle if and only if they make the same angle    ∠  A  P  C      normal-∠  A  P  C    \angle APC   in the opposite senses with the bisector of that angle (Fig.3).     (Figure)  Fig.1: Given two lines     m  1      subscript  m  1    m_{1}\,   and     m  2      subscript  m  2    m_{2}\,   , lines     l  1      subscript  l  1    l_{1}\,   and     l  2      subscript  l  2    l_{2}\,   are anti-parallel with respect to     m  1      subscript  m  1    m_{1}\,   and     m  2      subscript  m  2    m_{2}\,   if     ∠  1   =   ∠   2          normal-∠  1     normal-∠  2     \angle 1=\angle 2\,   .   (Figure)  Fig.2: In any quadrilateral inscribed in a circle, any two opposite sides are anti-parallel with respect to the other two sides.   (Figure)  Fig.3: Two lines     l  1      subscript  l  1    l_{1}\,   and     l  2      subscript  l  2    l_{2}\,   are said to be antiparallel with respect to the sides of an angle if they make the same angle    ∠  A  P  C      normal-∠  A  P  C    \angle APC   in the opposite senses with the bisector of that angle. Notice that our previous angles 1 and 2 are still equivalent.   (Figure)  Fig.4: If the lines     m  1      subscript  m  1    m_{1}\,   and     m  2      subscript  m  2    m_{2}\,   coincide,     l  1      subscript  l  1    l_{1}\,   and     l  2      subscript  l  2    l_{2}\,   are said to be anti-parallel with respect to a straight line.      Antiparallel vectors  In a Euclidean space , two directed line segments , often called vectors in applied mathematics, are antiparallel , if they are supported by parallel lines and have opposite directions. 1 In that case, one of the associated Euclidean vectors is the product of the other by a negative number .  Relations   The line joining the feet to two altitudes of a triangle is antiparallel to the third side.(any cevians which 'see' the third side with the same angle create antiparallel lines)  The tangent to a triangle's circumcircle at a vertex is antiparallel to the opposite side.  The radius of the circumcircle at a vertex is perpendicular to all lines antiparallel to the opposite sides.   References   A.B.
