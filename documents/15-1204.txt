   Cannabidiolic acid synthase      Cannabidiolic acid synthase   Cannabidiolic acid synthase (, CBDA synthase ) is an enzyme with system name cannabigerolate:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing, cannabidiolate-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   cannabigerolate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    cannabidiolate + H 2 O 2    Cannabidiolic acid synthase binds FAD covalently .
