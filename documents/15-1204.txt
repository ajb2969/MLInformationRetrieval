Cannabidiolic acid synthase

Cannabidiolic acid synthase (, CBDA synthase) is an enzyme with system name cannabigerolate:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing, cannabidiolate-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

cannabigerolate + O2

cannabidiolate + H2O2


Cannabidiolic acid synthase binds FAD covalently.
