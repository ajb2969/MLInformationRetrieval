Vicianin beta-glucosidase

In enzymology, a vicianin beta-glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-vicianin + H2O 
 
 
 
  mandelonitrile + vicianose
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-vicianin and H2O, whereas its two products are mandelonitrile and vicianose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-vicianin beta-D-glucohydrolase. This enzyme is also called vicianin hydrolase.
