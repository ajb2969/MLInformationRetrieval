   P-adic exponential function      P-adic exponential function   In mathematics , particularly p -adic analysis , the p -adic exponential function is a p -adic analogue of the usual exponential function on the complex numbers . As in the complex case, it has an inverse function named the p -adic logarithm .  Definition  The usual exponential function on C is defined by the infinite series        exp   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     z  n    n  !      .        z     superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript  z  n     n       \exp(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n!}.   Entirely analogously, one defines the exponential function on C p , the completion of the algebraic closure of Q p , by         exp  p    (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     z  n    n  !      .        subscript   p   z     superscript   subscript     n  0         superscript  z  n     n       \exp_{p}(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{z^{n}}{n!}.   However, unlike exp which converges on all of C , exp p only converges on the disc      𝐂  p  ×     superscript   subscript  𝐂  p   normal-×    {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{×}   converges for x in C p satisfying | x | p  p ( z ) for | z − 1| p  p ( zw ) = log p z + log p w . The function log p can be extended to all of    𝐂  p  ×     superscript   subscript  𝐂  p   normal-×    {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{×}   (the set of nonzero elements of C p ) by imposing that it continues to satisfy this last property and setting log p ( p ) = 0. Specifically, every element w of    𝐂  p  ×     superscript   subscript  𝐂  p   normal-×    {\mathbf{C}}_{p}^{×}   can be written as w = p r ·ζ· z with r a rational number, ζ a root of unity, and | z − 1| p in which case log p ( w ) = log p ( z ). 1 This function on ${\mathbf{ C } }_{p}^{×}$ is sometimes called the Iwasawa logarithm to emphasize the choice of log p ( p ) = 0. In fact, there is an extension of the logarithm from | z − 1| p ${\mathbf{ C } }_{p}^{×}$ for each choice of log p ( p ) in C p . 2  Properties  If z and w are both in the radius of convergence for exp p , then their sum is too and we have the usual addition formula: exp p ( z + w ) = exp p ( z )exp p ( w ).  Similarly if z and w are nonzero elements of C p then log p ( zw ) = log p z + log p w .  And for suitable z , so that everything is defined, we have exp p (log p ( z )) = z and log p (exp p ( z )) = z .  The roots of the Iwasawa logarithm log p ( z ) are exactly the elements of C p of the form ''p r'' ·ζ where r is a rational number and ζ is a root of unity. 3  Note that there is no analogue in C p of Euler's identity , e 2 πi = 1. This is a corollary of Strassmann's theorem .  Another major difference to the situation in C is that the domain of convergence of exp p is much smaller than that of log p . A modified exponential function — the Artin–Hasse exponential — can be used instead which converges on | z | p      In factoring w as above, there is a choice of a root involved in writing p r since r is rational; however, different choices differ only by multiplication by a root of unity, which gets absorbed into the factor ζ. ↩  ↩  ↩
