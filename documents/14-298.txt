P-adic exponential function

In mathematics, particularly p-adic analysis, the p-adic exponential function is a p-adic analogue of the usual exponential function on the complex numbers. As in the complex case, it has an inverse function named the p-adic logarithm.
Definition
The usual exponential function on C is defined by the infinite series


 
  Entirely analogously, one defines the exponential function on Cp, the completion of the algebraic closure of Qp, by


 
  However, unlike exp which converges on all of C, expp only converges on the disc


 
  converges for x in Cp satisfying |x|p p(z) for |z − 1|p p(zw) = logpz + logpw. The function logp can be extended to all of 
 
 
 
  (the set of nonzero elements of Cp) by imposing that it continues to satisfy this last property and setting logp(p) = 0. Specifically, every element w of 
 
 
 
  can be written as w = pr·ζ·z with r a rational number, ζ a root of unity, and |z − 1|p  in which case logp(w) = logp(z).1 This function on ${\mathbf{ C } }_{p}^{×}$ is sometimes called the Iwasawa logarithm to emphasize the choice of logp(p) = 0. In fact, there is an extension of the logarithm from |z − 1|p ${\mathbf{ C } }_{p}^{×}$ for each choice of logp(p) in Cp.2
Properties
If z and w are both in the radius of convergence for expp, then their sum is too and we have the usual addition formula: expp(z + w) = expp(z)expp(w).
Similarly if z and w are nonzero elements of Cp then logp(zw) = logpz + logpw.
And for suitable z, so that everything is defined, we have expp(logp(z)) = z and logp(expp(z)) = z.
The roots of the Iwasawa logarithm logp(z) are exactly the elements of Cp of the form ''pr''·ζ where r is a rational number and ζ is a root of unity.3
Note that there is no analogue in Cp of Euler's identity, e2πi = 1. This is a corollary of Strassmann's theorem.
Another major difference to the situation in C is that the domain of convergence of expp is much smaller than that of logp. A modified exponential function — the Artin–Hasse exponential — can be used instead which converges on |z|p 



In factoring w as above, there is a choice of a root involved in writing pr since r is rational; however, different choices differ only by multiplication by a root of unity, which gets absorbed into the factor ζ.↩
