That is, it is a graph of       D   (  x  )    -   x   log  x    -   x   (    2  γ   -  1   )          D  x     x    x      x      2  γ   1      D(x)-x\log x-x(2\gamma-1)     where    D   (  x  )       D  x    D(x)   is the divisor summatory function       D   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  ≤  x     d   (  n  )           D  x     subscript     n  x      d  n      D(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}d(n)     and    d   (  n  )       d  n    d(n)   is the divisor function . Here,    γ  =   0.577  …       γ    0.577  normal-…     \gamma=0.577\ldots   is the Euler-Mascheroni constant . The graph extends up to    x  =   10  7       x   superscript  10  7     x=10^{7}   . The green lines that do not quite bound the picture are a graph of    ±   2   x   7  /  22        plus-or-minus    2   superscript  x    7  22       \pm 2x^{7/22}   and give a general scale for the rate of growth for this function. Curiously, note that the function is not centered on the zero axis, but seems to be closer to the upper curve. Although the graph appears to be noisy, notice that it is less noisy than the corresponding graph for smaller n , and is more noisy than a similar graph for larger n .
