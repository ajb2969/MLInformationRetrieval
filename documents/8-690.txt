== Divisor summatory function== This graph illustrates the divisor summatory function with the leading asymptotic terms subtracted. That is, it is a graph of



where 
 
 
 
  is the divisor summatory function



and 
 
 
 
  is the divisor function. Here, 
 
 
 
  is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The graph extends up to 
 
 
 
 . The green lines that do not quite bound the picture are a graph of 
 
 
 
  and give a general scale for the rate of growth for this function. Curiously, note that the function is not centered on the zero axis, but seems to be closer to the upper curve. Although the graph appears to be noisy, notice that it is less noisy than the corresponding graph for smaller n, and is more noisy than a similar graph for larger n.
