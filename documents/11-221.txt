   L-rhamnonate dehydratase      L-rhamnonate dehydratase   In enzymology , a L-rhamnonate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-rhamnonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-rhamnonate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-rhamnonate , and two products , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-rhamnonate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-rhamnonate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-L-rhamnonate-forming) . This enzyme is also called L-rhamnonate hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
