Coherence time (communications systems)

In communications systems, a communication channel may change with time. Coherence time is the time duration over which the channel impulse response is considered to be not varying. Such channel variation is much more significant in wireless communications systems, due to Doppler effects.
Simple model
In a simple model, a signal 
 
 
 
  transmitted at time 
 
 
 
  will be received as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the channel impulse response (CIR) at time 
 
 
 
 . A signal transmitted at time 
 
 
 
  will be received as


 
  Now, if 
 
 
 
  is relatively small, the channel may be considered constant within the interval 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
Coherence time (
 
 
 
 ) will therefore be given by



Relation with Doppler frequency
Using Clarke's model, from the maximum Doppler frequency 
 
 
 
  we can obtain 50% coherence time 12


 
  Usually, we use the following relation3
