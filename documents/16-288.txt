TRNAIle-lysidine synthase

TRNAIle-lysidine synthase (, TilS, mesJ (gene), yacA (gene), isoleucine-specific transfer ribonucleate lysidine synthetase, tRNAIle-lysidine synthetase) is an enzyme with system name L-lysine:(tRNAIle2)-cytidine34 ligase (AMP-forming).12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

[tRNAIle2]-cytidine34 + L-lysine + ATP 
 
 
 
  [tRNAIle2]-lysidine34 + AMP + diphosphate + H2O
 

The bacterial enzyme modifies the wobble base of the CAU anticodon of tRNAIle at the oxo group in position 2 of cytidine34.
