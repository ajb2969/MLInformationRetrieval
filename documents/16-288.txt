   TRNAIle-lysidine synthase      TRNAIle-lysidine synthase   TRNAIle-lysidine synthase (, TilS , mesJ (gene) , yacA (gene) , isoleucine-specific transfer ribonucleate lysidine synthetase , tRNAIle-lysidine synthetase ) is an enzyme with system name L-lysine:(tRNAIle2)-cytidine34 ligase (AMP-forming) . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   [tRNAIle2]-cytidine34 + L- lysine + ATP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [tRNAIle2]-lysidine 34 + AMP + diphosphate + H 2 O   The bacterial enzyme modifies the wobble base of the CAU anticodon of tRNAIle at the oxo group in position 2 of cytidine 34 .
