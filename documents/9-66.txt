   Finite-rank operator      Finite-rank operator   In functional analysis , a branch of mathematics, a finite-rank operator is a bounded linear operator between Banach spaces whose range is finite-dimensional.  Finite-rank operators on a Hilbert space  A canonical form  Finite-rank operators are matrices (of finite size) transplanted to the infinite dimensional setting. As such, these operators may be described via linear algebra techniques.  From linear algebra, we know that a rectangular matrix, with complex entries, M ∈ C n × m has rank 1 if and only if M is of the form        M  =     α  ⋅  u    v  *    ,  where      ∥  u  ∥   =   ∥  v  ∥   =  1      and  α   ≥  0.      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence    M      normal-⋅  α  u    superscript  v     where         norm  u    norm  v        1        and  α   0.     M=\alpha\cdot uv^{*},\quad\mbox{where}\quad\|u\|=\|v\|=1\quad\mbox{and}\quad%
 \alpha\geq 0.     Exactly the same argument shows that an operator T on a Hilbert space H is of rank 1 if and only if         T  h   =    α   ⟨  h  ,  v  ⟩   u   for all     h  ∈  H    ,     formulae-sequence      T  h      α   h  v   u   for all      h  H     Th=\alpha\langle h,v\rangle u\quad\mbox{for all}\quad h\in H,     where the conditions on α , u , and v are the same as in the finite dimensional case.  Therefore, by induction, an operator T of finite rank n takes the form         T  h   =     ∑   i  =  1   n     α  i    ⟨  h  ,   v  i   ⟩    u  i     for all     h  ∈  H    ,     formulae-sequence      T  h      superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  α  i    h   subscript  v  i     subscript  u  i     for all      h  H     Th=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}\langle h,v_{i}\rangle u_{i}\quad\mbox{for all}%
 \quad h\in H,     where { u i } and { v i } are orthonormal bases. Notice this is essentially a restatement of singular value decomposition . This can be said to be a canonical form of finite-rank operators.  Generalizing slightly, if n is now countably infinite and the sequence of positive numbers { α i } accumulate only at 0, T is then a compact operator , and one has the canonical form for compact operators.  If the series ∑ i  α i is convergent, T is a trace class operator.  Algebraic property  The family of finite-rank operators F ( H ) on a Hilbert space H form a two-sided *-ideal in L ( H ), the algebra of bounded operators on H . In fact it is the minimal element among such ideals, that is, any two-sided *-ideal I in L ( H ) must contain the finite-rank operators. This is not hard to prove. Take a non-zero operator T ∈ I , then Tf = g for some f, g ≠ 0. It suffices to have that for any h, k ∈ H , the rank-1 operator S h, k that maps h to k lies in I . Define S h, f to be the rank-1 operator that maps h to f , and S g, k analogously. Then        S   h  ,  k    =    S   g  ,  k    T   S   h  ,  f      ,       subscript  S   h  k       subscript  S   g  k    T   subscript  S   h  f       S_{h,k}=S_{g,k}TS_{h,f},\,     which means S h, k is in I and this verifies the claim.  Some examples of two-sided *-ideals in L ( H ) are the trace-class , Hilbert–Schmidt operators , and compact operators . F ( H ) is dense in all three of these ideals, in their respective norms.  Since any two-sided ideal in L ( H ) must contain F ( H ), the algebra L ( H ) is simple if and only if it is finite dimensional.  Finite-rank operators on a Banach space  A finite-rank operator    T  :   U  →  V      normal-:  T   normal-→  U  V     T:U\to V   between Banach spaces is a bounded operator such that its range is finite dimensional. Just as in the Hilbert space case, it can be written in the form         T  h   =     ∑   i  =  1   n     α  i    ⟨  h  ,   v  i   ⟩    u  i     for all     h  ∈  U    ,     formulae-sequence      T  h      superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  α  i    h   subscript  v  i     subscript  u  i     for all      h  U     Th=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}\langle h,v_{i}\rangle u_{i}\quad\mbox{for all}%
 \quad h\in U,     where now     u  i   ∈  V       subscript  u  i   V    u_{i}\in V   , and     v  i   ∈   U  ′        subscript  v  i    superscript  U  normal-′     v_{i}\in U^{\prime}   are bounded linear functionals on the space   U   U   U   .  A bounded linear functional is a particular case of a finite-rank operator, namely of rank one.  "  Category:Operator theory
