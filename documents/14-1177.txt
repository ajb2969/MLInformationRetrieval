Munn semigroup

In mathematics, the Munn semigroup is the inverse semigroup of isomorphisms between principal ideals of a semilattice (commutative semigroup of idempotents).
Construction's steps
Let 
 
 
 
  be a semilattice.
1) For all e in E, we define Ee: = {i ∈ E : i ≤ e} which is a principal ideal of E.
2) For all e, f in E, we define Te,f as the set of isomorphisms of Ee onto Ef.
3) The Munn semigroup of the semilattice E is defined as: TE := 
 
 
 
  { Te,f : (e, f) ∈ U }.
The semigroup's operation is composition of mappings. In fact, we can observe that TE ⊆ IE where IE is the symmetric inverse semigroup because all isomorphisms are partial one-one maps from subsets of E onto subsets of E.
The idempotents of the Munn semigroup are the identity maps 1Ee.
Theorem
For every semilattice 
 
 
 
 , the semilattice of idempotents of 
 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to E.
Example
Let 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a semilattice under the usual ordering of the natural numbers (
 
 
 
 ). The principal ideals of 
 
 
 
  are then 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . So, the principal ideals 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
Thus 
 
 
 
 
  = {
 
 
 
 } where 
 
 
 
  is the identity map from En to itself, and 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 . In this example,
