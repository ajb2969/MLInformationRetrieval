Nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase

In enzymology, a nicotinate-nucleotide adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + nicotinate ribonucleotide 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + deamido-NAD+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and nicotinate ribonucleotide, whereas its two products are diphosphate and deamido-NAD+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:nicotinate-ribonucleotide adenylyltransferase. Other names in common use include deamido-NAD+ pyrophosphorylase, nicotinate mononucleotide adenylyltransferase, deamidonicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pyrophosphorylase, NaMN-ATase, and nicotinic acid mononucleotide adenylyltransferase. This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.
