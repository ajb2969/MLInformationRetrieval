   Wheel graph      Wheel graph   In the mathematical discipline of graph theory , a wheel graph  W n is a graph with n vertices (n ≥ 4), formed by connecting a single vertex to all vertices of an ( n -1)- cycle . The numerical notation for wheels is used inconsistently in the literature: some authors instead use n to refer to the length of the cycle, so that their W n is the graph we denote W n+1 . 1 A wheel graph can also be defined as the 1- skeleton of an ( n -1)-gonal pyramid .  Set-builder construction  Given a vertex set of {1,2,3,…,v}, the edge set of the wheel graph can be represented in set-builder notation by . 2  Properties  Wheel graphs are planar graphs , and as such have a unique planar embedding. More specifically, every wheel graph is a Halin graph . They are self-dual: the planar dual of any wheel graph is an isomorphic graph. Every maximal planar graph, other than K 4 = W 4 , contains as a subgraph either W 5 or W 6 .  There is always a Hamiltonian cycle in the wheel graph and there are      n  2   -   3  n    +  3         superscript  n  2     3  n    3    n^{2}-3n+3   cycles in W n .      The 7 cycles of the wheel graph W 4 .     For odd values of n , W n is a perfect graph with chromatic number 3: the vertices of the cycle can be given two colors, and the center vertex given a third color. For even n , W n has chromatic number 4, and (when n ≥ 6) is not perfect. W 7 is the only wheel graph that is a unit distance graph in the Euclidean plane. 3  The chromatic polynomial of the wheel graph W n is :          P   W  n     (  x  )    =   x   (     (   x  -  2   )    (   n  -  1   )    -     (   -  1   )   n    (   x  -  2   )     )     .         subscript  P   subscript  W  n    x     x     superscript    x  2     n  1       superscript    1   n     x  2        P_{W_{n}}(x)=x((x-2)^{(n-1)}-(-1)^{n}(x-2)).      In matroid theory, two particularly important special classes of matroids are the wheel matroids and the whirl matroids , both derived from wheel graphs. The k -wheel matroid is the graphic matroid of a wheel W k+1 , while the k -whirl matroid is derived from the k -wheel by considering the outer cycle of the wheel, as well as all of its spanning trees , to be independent.  The wheel W 6 supplied a counterexample to a conjecture of Paul Erdős on Ramsey theory : he had conjectured that the complete graph has the smallest Ramsey number among all graphs with the same chromatic number, but Faudree and McKay (1993) showed W 6 has Ramsey number 17 while the complete graph with the same chromatic number, K 4 , has Ramsey number 18. 4 That is, for every 17-vertex graph G , either G or its complement contains W 6 as a subgraph, while neither the 17-vertex Paley graph nor its complement contains a copy of K 4 .
