   Hydroxypyruvate isomerase      Hydroxypyruvate isomerase   In enzymology , a hydroxypyruvate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   hydroxypyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-hydroxy-3-oxopropanoate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , hydroxypyruvate , and one product , 2-hydroxy-3-oxopropanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses . The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydroxypyruvate aldose-ketose-isomerase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .
