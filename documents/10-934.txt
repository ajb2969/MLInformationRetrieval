   L-galactonolactone oxidase      L-galactonolactone oxidase   In enzymology , a L-galactonolactone oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-galactono-1,4-lactone + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-ascorbate + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-galactono-1,4-lactone and O 2 , whereas its two products are L- ascorbic acid and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-galactono-1,4-lactone:oxygen 3-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called L-galactono-1,4-lactone oxidase . This enzyme participates in ascorbic acid and aldaric acid metabolism. It employs one cofactor , FAD .
