   Anthranilate 3-monooxygenase (FAD)      Anthranilate 3-monooxygenase (FAD)   Anthranilate 3-monooxygenase (FAD) (, anthranilate 3-hydroxylase , anthranilate hydroxylase ) is an enzyme with system name anthranilate,FAD:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   anthranilate + FADH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    3-hydroxyanthranilate + FAD + H 2 O   The enzyme from the bacterium  Geobacillus thermodenitrificans participates in tryptophan degradation.
