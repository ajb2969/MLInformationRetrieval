<h1>Spherical design</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>spherical design</strong>, part of <a href="combinatorial_design" title="wikilink">combinatorial design</a> theory in <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, is a finite set of <em>N</em> points on the <em>d</em>-dimensional unit <a class="uri" href="n-sphere" title="wikilink">n-sphere</a> <em>S<sup>d</sup></em> such that the average value of any polynomial <em>f</em> of degree <em>t</em> or less on the set equals the average value of <em>f</em> on the whole sphere (that is, the integral of <em>f</em> over <em>S<sup>d</sup></em> divided by the area or <a href="Measure_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">measure</a> of <em>S<sup>d</sup></em>). Such a set is often called a <strong>spherical</strong> <em>t</em>-<strong>design</strong> to indicate the value of <em>t</em>, which is a fundamental parameter.</p>

<p>Spherical designs can be of value in <a href="approximation_theory" title="wikilink">approximation theory</a>, in <a class="uri" href="statistics" title="wikilink">statistics</a> for <a href="experimental_design" title="wikilink">experimental design</a> (being usable to construct <a href="rotatable_design" title="wikilink">rotatable designs</a>), in <a class="uri" href="combinatorics" title="wikilink">combinatorics</a>, and in <a class="uri" href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometry</a>. The main problem is to find examples, given <em>d</em> and <em>t</em>, that are not too large. However, such examples may be hard to come by. Spherical t-designs have also recently been appropriated in <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a> in the form of <a href="quantum_t-designs" title="wikilink">quantum t-designs</a> with various applications to <a href="quantum_information_theory" title="wikilink">quantum information theory</a>, <a href="quantum_computing" title="wikilink">quantum computing</a> and <a href="POVM" title="wikilink">POVMs</a>.</p>

<p>The concept of a spherical design is due to Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel (1977). The existence and structure of spherical designs with <em>d</em> = 1 (that is, in a circle) was studied in depth by Hong (1982).</p>

<p>Shortly thereafter, Seymour and Zaslavsky (1984) proved that such designs exist of all sufficiently large sizes; that is, there is a number <em>N</em>(<em>d</em>,<em>t</em>) such that for every <em>N</em> ≥ <em>N</em>(<em>d</em>,<em>t</em>) there exists a spherical <em>t</em>-design of <em>N</em> points in dimension <em>d</em>. However, their proof gave no idea of how big <em>N</em>(<em>d</em>,<em>t</em>) is. Good estimates for that were found later on. Besides these "large" sizes, there are many sporadic small spherical designs; many of them are related to finite <a href="group_action" title="wikilink">group actions</a> on the sphere and are of great interest in themselves.</p>

<p>Recently, Bondarenko, Radchenko, and Viazovska obtained the optimal asymptotic upper bound <span class="LaTeX">$N(d,t)<c_d math="" t^d<=""> for all positive integers ''d'' and ''t''.

Spherical designs with ''d'' = 2 (that is, on the surface of a sphere) ...

One application of spherical designs is for whole-sphere data collection.
Spherical t-designs meet the "accurately approximate integrals by sums" criteria for "good" pixelizations of the sphere.<ref>
