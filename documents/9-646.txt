   Banach *-algebra      Banach *-algebra   A Banach *-algebra  A is a Banach algebra over the field of complex numbers , together with a map * : A → A , called involution , that has the following properties:   ( x + y )* = x * + y * for all x , y in A .        (   λ  x   )   *   =    λ  ¯    x  *         superscript    λ  x        normal-¯  λ    superscript  x       (\lambda x)^{*}=\bar{\lambda}x^{*}   for every λ in C and every x in A ; here,    λ  ¯     normal-¯  λ    \bar{\lambda}   denotes the complex conjugate of λ.  ( xy )* = y * x * for all x , y in A .  ( x *)* = x for all x in A .   In most natural examples, one also has that the involution is isometric , i.e.   || x *|| = || x ||,   See also   Algebra over a field  Associative algebra  *-algebra  C*-algebra .
