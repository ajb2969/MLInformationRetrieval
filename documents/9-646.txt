Banach *-algebra

A Banach *-algebra A is a Banach algebra over the field of complex numbers, together with a map * : A → A, called involution, that has the following properties:

(x + y)* = x* + y* for all x, y in A.


 
  for every λ in C and every x in A; here, 
 
 
 
  denotes the complex conjugate of λ.
(xy)* = y* x* for all x, y in A.
(x*)* = x for all x in A.

In most natural examples, one also has that the involution is isometric, i.e.

||x*|| = ||x||,
