S-methyl-5'-thioinosine phosphorylase

S-methyl-5'-thioinosine phosphorylase (, MTIP, MTI phosphorylase, methylthioinosine phosphorylase) is an enzyme with system name S-methyl-5'-thioinosine:phosphate S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribosyl-transferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-methyl-5'-thioinosine + phosphate

hypoxanthine + S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate
 

The catabolism of 5'-methylthioadenosine in Pseudomonas aeruginosa involves deamination to S-methyl-5'-thioinosine (EC 3.5.4.31, S-methyl-5'-thioadenosine deaminase) and phosphorolysis to hypoxanthine.
