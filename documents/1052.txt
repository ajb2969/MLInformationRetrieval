   2,5-diaminovalerate transaminase      2,5-diaminovalerate transaminase   In enzymology , a 2,5-diaminovalerate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,5-diaminopentanoate + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-amino-2-oxopentanoate + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2,5-diaminopentanoate and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are 5-amino-2-oxopentanoate and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,5-diaminopentanoate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include diamino-acid transaminase , and diamino acid aminotransferase . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References     "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
