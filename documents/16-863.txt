Affine monoid

In abstract algebra, a branch of mathematics, an affine monoid is a commutative monoid that is finitely generated, and is isomorphic to a submonoid of a free abelian group ℤd, d ≥ 0.1 Affine monoids are closely connected to convex polyhedra, and their associated algebras are of much use in the algebraic study of these geometric objects.
Characterization

Affine monoids are finitely generated. This means for a monoid 
 
 
 
 , there exists 
 
 
 
  such that



 
 .

Affine monoids are cancellative. In other words,



 
  implies that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the binary operation on the affine monoid 
 
 
 
 .

Affine monoids are also torsion free. For an affine monoid 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  implies that 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .


A subset 
 
 
 
 
  of a monoid 
 
 
 
  that is itself a monoid with respect to the operation on 
 
 
 
  is a submonoid of 
 
 
 
 .

Properties and examples

Every submonoid of 
 
 
 
  is finitely generated. Hence, every submonoid of 
 
 
 
 
  is affine.
The submonoid 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is not finitely generated, and therefore not affine.
The intersection of two affine monoids is an affine monoid.

Affine monoids
Group of differences

If 
 
 
 
  is an affine monoid, it can be embedded into a group. More specifically, there is a unique group 
 
 
 
 , called the group of differences, in which 
 
 
 
 
  can be embedded.
 

Definition



 
  can be viewed as the set of equivalences classes 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 , for 
 
 
 
 
 , and



 
  defines the addition.2

The rank of an affine monoid 
 
 
 
  is the rank of a group of

If an affine monoid 
 
 
 
  is given as a submonoid of 
 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the subgroup of

Universal property

If 
 
 
 
  is an affine monoid, then the monoid homomorphism

 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  satisfies the following universal property:


for any monoid homomorphism 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a group, there is a unique group homomomorphism 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 
 , and since affine monoids are cancellative, it follows that 
 
 
 
  is an embedding. In other words, every affine monoid can be embedded into a group.
 

Normal affine monoids
Definition

If 
 
 
 
  is a submonoid of an affine monoid 
 
 
 
 , then the submonoid



 
  is the integral closure of 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is integrally closed

The normalization of an affine monoid 
 
 
 
  is the integral closure of 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . If the normalization of 
 
 
 
 , is 
 
 
 
  itself, then 
 
 
 
  is a normal affine monoid.5
A monoid 
 
 
 
 
  is a normal affine monoid if and only if 
 
 
 
  is finitely generated and 
 
 
 
  .

Affine monoid rings

Definition

Let 
 
 
 
  be an affine monoid, and 
 
 
 
  a commutative ring. Then one can form the affine monoid ring

 
 
 . This is an 
 
 
 
 -module with a free basis 
 
 
 
 , so if 
 
 
 
 , then



 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .

In other words, 
 
 
 
  is the set of finite sums of elements of 
 
 
 
  with coefficients in 
 
 
 
 .
 

Connection to convex geometry

Affine monoids arise naturally from convex polyhedra, convex cones, and their associated discrete structures.
 


Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a rational convex cone in 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be a lattice in 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is an affine monoid.6 (Lemma 2.9, Gordan's lemma)
If 
 
 
 
 
  is a submonoid of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a cone if and only if 
 
 
 
  is an affine monoid.
If 
 
 
 
  is a submonoid of 
 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a cone generated by the elements of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is an affine monoid.
Let 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
  be a rational polyhedron, 
 
 
 
  the recession cone of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  a lattice in 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 
  is a finitely generated module over the affine monoid
