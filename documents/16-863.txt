   Affine monoid      Affine monoid   In abstract algebra , a branch of mathematics , an affine monoid is a commutative  monoid that is finitely generated, and is isomorphic to a submonoid of a free abelian group ℤ d , d ≥ 0. 1 Affine monoids are closely connected to convex polyhedra , and their associated algebras are of much use in the algebraic study of these geometric objects.  Characterization   Affine monoids are finitely generated . This means for a monoid   M   M   M   , there exists      m  1   ,  …  ,   m  n    ∈  M        subscript  m  1   normal-…   subscript  m  n    M    m_{1},\dots,m_{n}\in M   such that       M  =     m  1    ℤ  +    +  …  +    m  n    ℤ  +         M       subscript  m  1    subscript  ℤ     normal-…     subscript  m  n    subscript  ℤ        M=m_{1}\mathbb{Z_{+}}+\dots+m_{n}\mathbb{Z_{+}}   .   Affine monoids are cancellative . In other words,        x  +  y   =   x  +  z         x  y     x  z     x+y=x+z   implies that    y  =  z      y  z    y=z   for all     x  ,  y  ,  z   ∈  M       x  y  z   M    x,y,z\in M   , where   +     +   denotes the binary operation on the affine monoid   M   M   M   .   Affine monoids are also torsion free . For an affine monoid   M   M   M   ,     n  x   =   n  y         n  x     n  y     nx=ny   implies that    x  =  y      x  y    x=y   for    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   , and     x  ,  y   ∈  M       x  y   M    x,y\in M   .    A subset   N   N   N   of a monoid   M   M   M   that is itself a monoid with respect to the operation on   M   M   M   is a submonoid of   M   M   M   .   Properties and examples   Every submonoid of   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   is finitely generated. Hence, every submonoid of   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   is affine.  The submonoid     {    (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   ℤ  ×  ℤ    ∣   y  >  0   }   ∪   {   (  0  ,  0  )   }        conditional-set     x  y     ℤ  ℤ      y  0      0  0      \{(x,y)\in\mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}\mid y>0\}\cup\{(0,0)\}   of    ℤ  ×  ℤ      ℤ  ℤ    \mathbb{Z}\times\mathbb{Z}   is not finitely generated, and therefore not affine.  The intersection of two affine monoids is an affine monoid.   Affine monoids  Group of differences   If   M   M   M   is an affine monoid, it can be embedded into a group . More specifically, there is a unique group    g  p   (  M  )       g  p  M    gp(M)   , called the group of differences , in which   M   M   M   can be embedded.   Definition       g  p   (  M  )       g  p  M    gp(M)   can be viewed as the set of equivalences classes    x  -  y      x  y    x-y   , where     x  -  y   =   u  -  v         x  y     u  v     x-y=u-v   if and only if     x  +  v  +  z   =   u  +  y  +  z         x  v  z     u  y  z     x+v+z=u+y+z   , for    z  ∈  M      z  M    z\in M   , and         (   x  -  y   )   +   (   u  -  v   )    =    (   x  +  u   )   -   (   y  +  v   )            x  y     u  v        x  u     y  v      (x-y)+(u-v)=(x+u)-(y+v)   defines the addition. 2   The rank of an affine monoid   M   M   M   is the rank of a group of    g  p   (  M  )       g  p  M    gp(M)   . 3    If an affine monoid   M   M   M   is given as a submonoid of    ℤ  r     superscript  ℤ  r    \mathbb{Z}^{r}   , then     g  p   (  M  )    ≅   ℤ  M         g  p  M     ℤ  M     gp(M)\cong\mathbb{Z}M   , where    ℤ  M      ℤ  M    \mathbb{Z}M   is the subgroup of    ℤ  r     superscript  ℤ  r    \mathbb{Z}^{r}    4   Universal property   If   M   M   M   is an affine monoid, then the monoid homomorphism     ι  :   M  →   g  p   (  M  )        normal-:  ι   normal-→  M    g  p  M      \iota:M\to gp(M)   defined by     ι   (  x  )    =   x  +  0         ι  x     x  0     \iota(x)=x+0   satisfies the following universal property :    for any monoid homomorphism    φ  :   M  →  G      normal-:  φ   normal-→  M  G     \varphi:M\to G   , where   G   G   G   is a group, there is a unique group homomomorphism    ψ  :    g  p   (  M  )    →  G      normal-:  ψ   normal-→    g  p  M   G     \psi:gp(M)\to G   , such that    φ  =   ψ  ∘  ι       φ    ψ  ι     \varphi=\psi\circ\iota   , and since affine monoids are cancellative, it follows that   ι   ι   \iota   is an embedding. In other words, every affine monoid can be embedded into a group.   Normal affine monoids  Definition   If   M   M   M   is a submonoid of an affine monoid   N   N   N   , then the submonoid         M  ^   N   =   {   x  ∈  N   ∣     m  x   ∈  M   ,   m  ∈  ℕ    }        subscript   normal-^  M   N    conditional-set    x  N    formulae-sequence      m  x   M     m  ℕ       \hat{M}_{N}=\{x\in N\mid mx\in M,m\in\mathbb{N}\}   is the integral closure of   M   M   M   in   N   N   N   . If    M  =    M  N   ^       M   normal-^   subscript  M  N      M=\hat{M_{N}}   , then   M   M   M   is integrally closed   The normalization of an affine monoid   M   M   M   is the integral closure of   M   M   M   in    g  p   (  M  )       g  p  M    gp(M)   . If the normalization of   M   M   M   , is   M   M   M   itself, then   M   M   M   is a normal affine monoid. 5  A monoid   M   M   M   is a normal affine monoid if and only if     ℝ  +   M       subscript  ℝ    M    \mathbb{R}_{+}M   is finitely generated and    M  =    ℤ  r   ∩    ℝ  +   M        M     superscript  ℤ  r      subscript  ℝ    M      M=\mathbb{Z}^{r}\cap\mathbb{R}_{+}M   .   Affine monoid rings   see also: Group ring    Definition   Let   M   M   M   be an affine monoid, and   R   R   R   a commutative ring . Then one can form the affine monoid ring     R   [  M  ]       R   delimited-[]  M     R[M]   . This is an   R   R   R   -module with a free basis   M   M   M   , so if    f  ∈   R   [  M  ]        f    R   delimited-[]  M      f\in R[M]   , then       f  =    ∑   i  =  1   n     f  i    x  i         f    superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  f  i    subscript  x  i       f=\sum_{i=1}^{n}f_{i}x_{i}   , where      f  i   ∈  R   ,    x  i   ∈  M      formulae-sequence     subscript  f  i   R      subscript  x  i   M     f_{i}\in R,x_{i}\in M   , and    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   .   In other words,    R   [  M  ]       R   delimited-[]  M     R[M]   is the set of finite sums of elements of   M   M   M   with coefficients in   R   R   R   .   Connection to convex geometry   Affine monoids arise naturally from convex polyhedra, convex cones , and their associated discrete structures.    Let   C   C   C   be a rational convex cone in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , and let   L   L   L   be a lattice in    ℚ  n     superscript  ℚ  n    \mathbb{Q}^{n}   . Then    C  ∩  L      C  L    C\cap L   is an affine monoid. 6 (Lemma 2.9, Gordan's lemma)  If   M   M   M   is a submonoid of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , then     ℝ  +   M       subscript  ℝ    M    \mathbb{R}_{+}M   is a cone if and only if   M   M   M   is an affine monoid.  If   M   M   M   is a submonoid of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , and   C   C   C   is a cone generated by the elements of    g  p   (  M  )       g  p  M    gp(M)   , then    M  ∩  C      M  C    M\cap C   is an affine monoid.  Let   P   P   P   in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   be a rational polyhedron,   C   C   C   the recession cone of   P   P   P   , and   L   L   L   a lattice in    ℚ  n     superscript  ℚ  n    \mathbb{Q}^{n}   . Then    P  ∩  L      P  L    P\cap L   is a finitely generated module over the affine monoid    C  ∩  L      C  L    C\cap L   . 7 (Theorem 2.12)   See also   Monoid  Convex cone  Convex polytope  Lattice (group)  K-theory   References    "  Category:Algebraic structures     ↩
