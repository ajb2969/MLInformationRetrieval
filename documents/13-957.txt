Jucys–Murphy element

In mathematics, the Jucys–Murphy elements in the group algebra

 
  of the symmetric group, named after Algimantas Adolfas Jucys and G. E. Murphy, are defined as a sum of transpositions by the formula:



They play an important role in the representation theory of the symmetric group.
Properties
They generate a commutative subalgebra of 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, Xn commutes with all elements of 
 
 
 
 .
The vectors of the Young basis are eigenvectors for the action of Xn. For any standard Young tableau U we have:



where ck(U) is the content b − a of the cell (a, b) occupied by k in the standard Young tableau U.
Theorem (Jucys): The center

 
  of the group algebra 
 
 
 
  of the symmetric group is generated by the symmetric polynomials in the elements Xk.
Theorem (Jucys): Let t be a formal variable commuting with everything, then the following identity for polynomials in variable t with values in the group algebra 
 
 
 
  holds true:



Theorem (Okounkov–Vershik): The subalgebra of 
 
 
 
  generated by the centers



is exactly the subalgebra generated by the Jucys–Murphy elements Xk.
