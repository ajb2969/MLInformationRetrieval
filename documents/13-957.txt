   Jucys–Murphy element      Jucys–Murphy element   In mathematics , the Jucys–Murphy elements in the group algebra     ℂ   [   S  n   ]       ℂ   delimited-[]   subscript  S  n      \mathbb{C}[S_{n}]   of the symmetric group , named after Algimantas Adolfas Jucys and G. E. Murphy, are defined as a sum of transpositions by the formula:         X  1   =  0   ,     X  k   =    (   1  k   )   +   (   2  k   )   +  ⋯  +   (   k  -    1   k    )     ,   k  =   2  ,  …  ,  n      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  X  1   0    formulae-sequence     subscript  X  k       1  k     2  k   normal-⋯    k    1  k        k   2  normal-…  n       X_{1}=0,~{}~{}~{}X_{k}=(1k)+(2k)+\cdots+(k-1\ k),~{}~{}~{}k=2,\dots,n.     They play an important role in the representation theory of the symmetric group .  Properties  They generate a commutative subalgebra of    ℂ   [   S  n   ]       ℂ   delimited-[]   subscript  S  n      \mathbb{C}[S_{n}]   . Moreover, X n commutes with all elements of    ℂ   [   S   n  -  1    ]       ℂ   delimited-[]   subscript  S    n  1       \mathbb{C}[S_{n-1}]   .  The vectors of the Young basis are eigenvectors for the action of X n . For any standard Young tableau  U we have:          X  k    v  U    =    c  k    (  U  )    v  U     ,   k  =   1  ,  …  ,  n     ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  X  k    subscript  v  U       subscript  c  k   U   subscript  v  U       k   1  normal-…  n      X_{k}v_{U}=c_{k}(U)v_{U},~{}~{}~{}k=1,\dots,n,     where c k ( U ) is the content  b − a of the cell ( a , b ) occupied by k in the standard Young tableau U .  Theorem (Jucys): The center     Z   (   ℂ   [   S  n   ]    )       Z    ℂ   delimited-[]   subscript  S  n       Z(\mathbb{C}[S_{n}])   of the group algebra    ℂ   [   S  n   ]       ℂ   delimited-[]   subscript  S  n      \mathbb{C}[S_{n}]   of the symmetric group is generated by the symmetric polynomials in the elements X k .  Theorem (Jucys): Let t be a formal variable commuting with everything, then the following identity for polynomials in variable t with values in the group algebra    ℂ   [   S  n   ]       ℂ   delimited-[]   subscript  S  n      \mathbb{C}[S_{n}]   holds true:         (   t  +   X  1    )    (   t  +   X  2    )   ⋯   (   t  +   X  n    )    =    ∑   σ  ∈   S  n      σ   t   number of cycles of  σ       .          t   subscript  X  1      t   subscript  X  2    normal-⋯    t   subscript  X  n       subscript     σ   subscript  S  n       σ   superscript  t    number of cycles of  σ        (t+X_{1})(t+X_{2})\cdots(t+X_{n})=\sum_{\sigma\in S_{n}}\sigma t^{\text{number%
  of cycles of }\sigma}.
