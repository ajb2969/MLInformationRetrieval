Quinaldate 4-oxidoreductase

In enzymology, a quinaldate 4-oxidoreductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

quinaldate + acceptor + H2O 
 
 
 
  kynurenate + reduced acceptor
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are quinaldate, acceptor, and H2O, whereas its two products are kynurenate and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is quinoline-2-carboxylate:acceptor 4-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating). This enzyme is also called quinaldic acid 4-oxidoreductase.
