   Anthranilate N-malonyltransferase      Anthranilate N-malonyltransferase   In enzymology , an anthranilate N-malonyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   malonyl-CoA + anthranilate $\rightleftharpoons$ CoA + N-malonylanthranilate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and anthranilate , whereas its two products are CoA and N-malonylanthranilate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:anthranilate N-malonyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
