Artin–Tate lemma

In algebra, the Artin–Tate lemma states:1

Let A be a Noetherian ring and 
 
 
 
  algebras over A. If C is of finite type over A and if C is finite over B, then B is of finite type over A.
 

(Here, "of finite type" means "finitely generated algebra" and "finite" means "finitely generated module".) The lemma was introduced by E. Artin and J. Tate in 19512 to give a proof of Hilbert's Nullstellensatz.
Proof
The following proof can be found in Atiyah–MacDonald.3 Let 
 
 
 
  generate 
 
 
 
  as an 
 
 
 
 -algebra and let 
 
 
 
  generate 
 
 
 
  as a 
 
 
 
 -module. Then we can write 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is finite over the 
 
 
 
 -algebra 
 
 
 
  generated by the 
 
 
 
 . Using that 
 
 
 
  and hence 
 
 
 
  is Noetherian, also 
 
 
 
  is finite over 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is a finitely generated 
 
 
 
 -algebra, also 
 
 
 
  is a finitely genrated 
 
 
 
 -algebra.
