   Stable manifold      Stable manifold   In mathematics , and in particular the study of dynamical systems , the idea of stable and unstable sets or stable and unstable manifolds give a formal mathematical definition to the general notions embodied in the idea of an attractor or repellor . In the case of hyperbolic dynamics , the corresponding notion is that of the hyperbolic set .  Definition  The following provides a definition for the case of a system that is either an iterated function or has discrete-time dynamics. Similar notions apply for systems whose time evolution is given by a flow .  Let   X   X   X   be a topological space , and    f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f\colon X\to X   a homeomorphism . If   p   p   p   is a fixed point for   f   f   f   , the stable set of   p   p   p    is defined by        W  s    (  f  ,  p  )    =   {   q  ∈  X   :     f  n    (  q  )    →   p  as  n   →  ∞   }          superscript  W  s    f  p     conditional-set    q  X      normal-→     superscript  f  n   q     p  as  n     normal-→          W^{s}(f,p)=\{q\in X:f^{n}(q)\to p\mbox{ as }n\to\infty\}   and the unstable set of   p   p   p    is defined by         W  u    (  f  ,  p  )    =   {   q  ∈  X   :     f   -  n     (  q  )    →   p  as  n   →  ∞   }    .         superscript  W  u    f  p     conditional-set    q  X      normal-→     superscript  f    n    q     p  as  n     normal-→          W^{u}(f,p)=\{q\in X:f^{-n}(q)\to p\mbox{ as }n\to\infty\}.     Here,    f   -  1      superscript  f    1     f^{-1}   denotes the inverse of the function   f   f   f   , i.e.     f  ∘   f   -  1     =    f   -  1    ∘  f   =   i   d  X            f   superscript  f    1        superscript  f    1    f          i   subscript  d  X       f\circ f^{-1}=f^{-1}\circ f=id_{X}   , where    i   d  X       i   subscript  d  X     id_{X}   is the identity map on   X   X   X   .  If   p   p   p   is a periodic point of least period   k   k   k   , then it is a fixed point of    f  k     superscript  f  k    f^{k}   , and the stable and unstable sets of   p   p   p   are        W  s    (  f  ,  p  )    =    W  s    (   f  k   ,  p  )           superscript  W  s    f  p       superscript  W  s     superscript  f  k   p      W^{s}(f,p)=W^{s}(f^{k},p)   and         W  u    (  f  ,  p  )    =    W  u    (   f  k   ,  p  )     .         superscript  W  u    f  p       superscript  W  u     superscript  f  k   p      W^{u}(f,p)=W^{u}(f^{k},p).     Given a neighborhood    U   U   U   of   p   p   p   , the local stable and unstable sets of   p   p   p   are defined by        W  loc  s    (  f  ,  p  ,  U  )    =   {   q  ∈  U   :     f  n    (  q  )    ∈   U  for each  n   ≥  0   }          subscript   superscript  W  s   loc    f  p  U     conditional-set    q  U          superscript  f  n   q     U  for each  n        0       W^{s}_{\mathrm{loc}}(f,p,U)=\{q\in U:f^{n}(q)\in U\mbox{ for each }n\geq 0\}   and         W  loc  u    (  f  ,  p  ,  U  )    =    W  loc  s    (   f   -  1    ,  p  ,  U  )     .         subscript   superscript  W  u   loc    f  p  U       subscript   superscript  W  s   loc     superscript  f    1    p  U      W^{u}_{\mathrm{loc}}(f,p,U)=W^{s}_{\mathrm{loc}}(f^{-1},p,U).     If   X   X   X   is metrizable , we can define the stable and unstable sets for any point by        W  s    (  f  ,  p  )    =   {   q  ∈  X   :    d   (    f  n    (  q  )    ,    f  n    (  p  )    )    →   0  for  n   →  ∞   }          superscript  W  s    f  p     conditional-set    q  X      normal-→    d      superscript  f  n   q      superscript  f  n   p       0  for  n     normal-→          W^{s}(f,p)=\{q\in X:d(f^{n}(q),f^{n}(p))\to 0\mbox{ for }n\to\infty\}   and         W  u    (  f  ,  p  )    =    W  s    (   f   -  1    ,  p  )     ,         superscript  W  u    f  p       superscript  W  s     superscript  f    1    p      W^{u}(f,p)=W^{s}(f^{-1},p),     where   d   d   d   is a metric for   X   X   X   . This definition clearly coincides with the previous one when   p   p   p   is a periodic point.  Suppose now that   X   X   X   is a compact  smooth manifold , and   f   f   f   is a    𝒞  k     superscript  𝒞  k    \mathcal{C}^{k}    diffeomorphism ,    k  ≥  1      k  1    k\geq 1   . If   p   p   p   is a hyperbolic periodic point, the stable manifold theorem assures that for some neighborhood   U   U   U   of   p   p   p   , the local stable and unstable sets are    𝒞  k     superscript  𝒞  k    \mathcal{C}^{k}   embedded disks, whose tangent spaces at   p   p   p   are    E  s     superscript  E  s    E^{s}   and    E  u     superscript  E  u    E^{u}   (the stable and unstable spaces of    D  f   (  p  )       D  f  p    Df(p)   ), respectively; moreover, they vary continuously (in a certain sense) in a neighborhood of   f   f   f   in the    𝒞  k     superscript  𝒞  k    \mathcal{C}^{k}   topology of     Diff  k    (  X  )        superscript  Diff  k   X    \mathrm{Diff}^{k}(X)   (the space of all    𝒞  k     superscript  𝒞  k    \mathcal{C}^{k}   diffeomorphisms from   X   X   X   to itself). Finally, the stable and unstable sets are    𝒞  k     superscript  𝒞  k    \mathcal{C}^{k}   injectively immersed disks. This is why they are commonly called stable and unstable manifolds . This result is also valid for nonperiodic points, as long as they lie in some hyperbolic set (stable manifold theorem for hyperbolic sets).  Remark  If   X   X   X   is a (finite-dimensional) vector space and   f   f   f   an isomorphism, its stable and unstable sets are called stable space and unstable space, respectively.
