TRNA-guanine15 transglycosylase

TRNA-guanine15 transglycosylase (, tRNA transglycosylase, transfer ribonucleate glycosyltransferase, tRNA guanine15 transglycosidase, TGT, transfer ribonucleic acid guanine15 transglycosylase) is an enzyme with system name tRNA-guanine15:7-cyano-7-carbaguanine tRNA-D-ribosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

guanine15 in tRNA + 7-cyano-7-carbaguanine 
 
 
 
  7-cyano-7-carbaguanine15 in tRNA + guanine


Archaeal tRNAs contain the modified nucleoside archaeosine at position 15.
