   Diacylglycerol—sterol O-acyltransferase      Diacylglycerol—sterol O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a diacylglycerol-sterol O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol + sterol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   monoacylglycerol + sterol ester   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol and sterol , whereas its two products are monoacylglycerol and sterol ester .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol:sterol O-acyltransferase . This enzyme is also called 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol:sterol acyl transferase . This enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthesis .  References       "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
