Peter Duren

Peter Larkin Duren (born 30 April 1935, New Orleans, Louisiana)1 is an American mathematician, who specializes in mathematical analysis and is known for the monographs and textbooks he has written.
Duren received in 1956 his bachelor's degree from Harvard University and in 1960 his PhD from MIT under Gian-Carlo Rota with thesis Spectral theory of a class of non-selfadjoint infinite matrix operators.2 As a postdoc he was an instructor at Stanford University. At the University of Michigan, he became in 1962 an assistant professor, in 1966 an associate professor, in 1969 a professor, and in 2010 a professor emeritus.
Duren was in 1968/69 at the Institute for Advanced Study, in 1975 a visiting professor at the Technion in Haifa, in 1964/65 a visiting scientist at Imperial College and the University of Paris-Sud in Orsay, in 1982 a visiting professor at the University of Maryland and in 1982/83 at the Mittag-Leffler Institute, the University of Paris-Sud and at the ETH ZÃ¼rich. In 1989 he was a visiting scientist at Stanford University, in 1993 at the University of Hawaii and in 1996 at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim. He has also been a visiting scientist in Halle, at the Max-Planck Institute in Leipzig, at the University of Witwatersrand, in Santiago de Chile, at the Autonomous University of Madrid, at Bar-Ilan University and the Academia Sinica in Beijing.
In 1976/77 he was chief editor of the Michigan Mathematical Journal. He was a co-editor of the American Mathematical Monthly and a festschrift for Frederick Gehring.
Duren's research and expository writing deals with function theory and functional analysis, including Hardy spaces, schlicht functions, harmonic analysis, geometric function theory, potential theory, and special functions.
From 1964 to 1966 he was a Sloan Fellow. In 2012 he became a Fellow of the American Mathematical Society.
