   Homothetic vector field      Homothetic vector field   A homothetic vector field (sometimes homothetic collineation or homothety ) is a projective vector field which satisfies the condition:        ℒ  X    g   a  b     =   2  c   g   a  b            subscript  ℒ  X    subscript  g    a  b       2  c   subscript  g    a  b       \mathcal{L}_{X}g_{ab}=2cg_{ab}     where c is a real constant. Homothetic vector fields find application in the study of singularities in general relativity . They can also be used to generate new solutions for Einstein equations by similarity reduction. 1  See also   Affine vector field  Curvature collineation  Killing vector field  Matter collineation  Spacetime symmetries   References  "  Category:Mathematical methods in general relativity     ↩
