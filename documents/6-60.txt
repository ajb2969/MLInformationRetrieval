Homothetic vector field

A homothetic vector field (sometimes homothetic collineation or homothety) is a projective vector field which satisfies the condition:



where c is a real constant. Homothetic vector fields find application in the study of singularities in general relativity. They can also be used to generate new solutions for Einstein equations by similarity reduction.1
