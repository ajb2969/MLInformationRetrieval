   Rational quadratic covariance function      Rational quadratic covariance function   In statistics , the rational quadratic covariance function is used in spatial statistics , geostatistics , machine learning , image analysis, and other fields where multivariate statistical analysis is conducted on metric spaces . It is commonly used to define the statistical covariance between measurements made at two points that are d units distant from each other. Since the covariance only depends on distances between points, it is stationary . If the distance is Euclidean distance , the rational quadratic covariance function is also isotropic .  The rational quadratic covariance between two points separated by d distance units is given by       C   (  d  )    =    (   1  +    d  2    2  α   k  2      )    -  α          C  d    superscript    1     superscript  d  2     2  α   superscript  k  2        α      C(d)=\Bigg(1+\frac{d^{2}}{2\alpha k^{2}}\Bigg)^{-\alpha}     where α and k are non-negative parameters of the covariance.
