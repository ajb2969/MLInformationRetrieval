   Normalized frequency (fiber optics)      Normalized frequency (fiber optics)   In an optical fiber , the normalized frequency , V (also called the V number ), is given by      V  =    2  π  a   λ      n  1    2   -   n  2    2     =    2  π  a   λ   NA  ,     fragments  V       2  π  a   λ        superscript   subscript  n  1   2    superscript   subscript  n  2   2           2  π  a   λ   NA  normal-,    V={2\pi a\over\lambda}\sqrt{{n_{1}}^{2}-{n_{2}}^{2}}\quad={2\pi a\over\lambda}%
 \mathrm{NA},   where a is the core radius, λ is the wavelength in vacuum, n 1 is the maximum refractive index of the core, n 2 is the refractive index of the homogeneous cladding, and applying the usual definition of the numerical aperture  NA .  In multimode operation of an optical fiber having a power-law refractive index profile , the approximate number of bound modes (the mode volume ), is given by        V  2   2    (   g   g  +  2    )   ,     fragments     superscript  V  2   2    fragments  normal-(    g    g  2    normal-)    normal-,    {V^{2}\over 2}\left({g\over g+2}\right)\quad,   where g is the profile parameter, and V is the normalized frequency, which must be greater than 5 for the approximation to be valid.  For a step index fiber , the mode volume is given by 4 V 2 / π 2 . For single-mode operation is required that V 0.  References     "  Category:Fiber optics
