   Π01 class      Π01 class   In computability theory , a Π 0 1 class is a subset of 2 ω of a certain form. These classes are of interest as a technical tool within recursion theory and effective descriptive set theory . They are also used in the application of recursion theory to other branches of mathematics (Cenzer 1999, p. 39).  Definition  The set 2 consists of all finite sequences of 0s and 1s, while the set 2 ω consists of all infinite sequences of 0s and 1s (that is, functions from } to the set }).  A tree on 2 is a subset of 2 <ω that is closed under taking initial segments. An element f of 2 ω is a path through a tree T on 2 if every finite initial segment of f is in T .  A ( lightface ) Π 0 1 class is a subset C of 2 ω for which there is a computable tree T such that C consists of exactly the paths through T . A boldface Π 0 1 class is a subset D of 2 ω for which there is an oracle f in 2 ω and a subtree tree T of 2 from computable from f such that D is the set of paths through T .  As effectively closed sets  The boldface Π 0 1 classes are exactly the same as the closed sets of 2 ω and thus the same as the boldface Π 0 1 subsets of 2 ω in the Borel hierarchy .  Lightface Π 0 1 classes in 2 ω (that is, Π 0 1 classes whose tree is computable with no oracle) correspond to effectively closed sets . A subset B of 2 ω is effectively closed if there is a recursively enumerable sequence 〈σ i : i ∈ ω〉 of elements of 2 such that each g ∈ 2 ω is in B if and only if σ i is an initial segment of B .  Relationship with effective theories  For each effectively axiomatized theory T of first-order logic , the set of all completions of T is a    Π  1  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  0   1    \Pi^{0}_{1}   class. Moreover, for each    Π  1  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  0   1    \Pi^{0}_{1}   subset S of    2  ω     superscript  2  ω    2^{\omega}   there is an effectively axiomatized theory T such that each element of S computes a completion of T , and each completion of T computes an element of S (Jockusch and Soare 1972b).
