Beurling algebra

In mathematics, the term Beurling algebra is used for different algebras introduced by , usually it is an algebra of periodic functions with Fourier series



Example We may consider the algebra of those functions f where the majorants



of the Fourier coefficients an are summable. In other words



Example We may consider a weight function w on 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  in which case 
 
 
 
  is a unitary commutative Banach algebra.
These algebras are closely related to the Wiener algebra.
