   Beurling algebra      Beurling algebra   In mathematics, the term Beurling algebra is used for different algebras introduced by , usually it is an algebra of periodic functions with Fourier series       f   (  x  )    =   ∑    a  n    e   i  n  x            f  x        subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i  n  x        f(x)=\sum a_{n}e^{inx}     Example We may consider the algebra of those functions f where the majorants       c  k   =    sup    |  n  |   ≥  k     |   a  n   |         subscript  c  k     subscript  supremum      n   k       subscript  a  n       c_{k}=\sup_{|n|\geq k}|a_{n}|     of the Fourier coefficients a n are summable. In other words         ∑   k  ≥  0     c  k    <  ∞   .        subscript     k  0     subscript  c  k       \sum_{k\geq 0}c_{k}<\infty.     Example We may consider a weight function w on   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   such that        w   (   m  +  n   )    ≤   w   (  m  )   w   (  n  )     ,    w   (  0  )    =  1      formulae-sequence      w    m  n      w  m  w  n        w  0   1     w(m+n)\leq w(m)w(n),\quad w(0)=1   in which case      A  w    (  𝕋  )    =    {  f  :     f   (  t  )    =    ∑  n     a  n    e   i  n  t       ,     ∥  f  ∥   w   =    ∑  n     |   a  n   |   w   (  n  )     <  ∞    }      (    ∼    ℓ  w  1    (  ℤ  )     )           subscript  A  w   𝕋    annotated   conditional-set  f   formulae-sequence      f  t     subscript   n      subscript  a  n    superscript  e    i  n  t            subscript   norm  f   w     subscript   n        subscript  a  n    w  n               similar-to  absent     subscript   superscript  normal-ℓ  1   w   ℤ       A_{w}(\mathbb{T})=\{f:f(t)=\sum_{n}a_{n}e^{int},\,\|f\|_{w}=\sum_{n}|a_{n}|w(n%
 )<\infty\}\,(\sim\ell^{1}_{w}(\mathbb{Z}))   is a unitary  commutative  Banach algebra .  These algebras are closely related to the Wiener algebra .  References      "  Category:Fourier series  Category:Algebras
