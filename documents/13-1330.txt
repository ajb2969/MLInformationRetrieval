Doubly logarithmic tree

In computer science a doubly logarithmic tree is a tree where each internal node of height 1, the tree layer above the leaves, has two children, and each internal node of height 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  children. Each child of the root contains 
 
 
 
  leaves. The number of children at a node as we go from leaf to root is 0,2,2,4,16, 256, 65536, ... 
A similar tree called a k-merger is used in Prokop et al.'s cache oblivious Funnelsort to merge elements.
