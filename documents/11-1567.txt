Phosphoenolpyruvate—glycerone phosphotransferase




Phosphoenolpyruvate—glycerone phosphotransferase

In enzymology, a phosphoenolpyruvate-glycerone phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phosphoenolpyruvate + glycerone 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + glycerone phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphoenolpyruvate and glycerone, whereas its two products are pyruvate and glycerone phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoenolpyruvate:glycerone phosphotransferase.
