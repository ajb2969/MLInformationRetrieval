It is called paracompact because it has infinite cells. Each cell consists of a hexagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a horosphere: a flat plane in hyperbolic space that approaches a single ideal point at infinity.
The Schläfli symbol of the hexagonal tiling honeycomb is {6,3,3}. Since that of the hexagonal tiling of the plane is {6,3}, this honeycomb has three such hexagonal tilings meeting at each edge. Since the Schläfli symbol of the tetrahedron is {3,3}, the vertex figure of this honeycomb is an tetrahedron. Thus, six hexagonal tilings meet at each vertex of this honeycomb, and four edges meet at each vertex.1

Viewed in perspective outside of a Poincaré disk model, this shows one hexagonal tiling cell within the honeycomb, and its mid-radius horosphere (the horosphere incident with edge midpoints). In this projection, the hexagons grow infinitely small towards the infinite boundary asymptoting towards a single ideal point. It can be seen as similar to the order-3 apeirogonal tiling, {∞,3} of H2, with horocycle circumscribing vertices of apeirogonal faces.

Symmetry constructions
 It has a total of five reflectional constructions from five related Coxeter groups all with four mirrors and only the first being regular:  [6,3,3],  [3,6,3],  [6,3,6],  [6,3[3]] and [3[3,3]] , having 1, 4, 6, 12 and 24 times larger fundamental domains respectively. In Coxeter notation subgroup markups, they are related as: [6,(3,3)*] (remove 3 mirrors, index 24 subgroup); [3,6,3*] or [3*,6,3] (remove 2 mirrors, index 6 subgroup); [1+,6,3,6,1+] (remove two orthogonal mirrors, index 4 subgroup); all of these are isomorphic to [3[3,3]]. The ringed Coxeter diagrams are , , ,  and , representing different types (colors) of hexagonal tilings in the Wythoff construction.
