Sulfate-transporting ATPase




Sulfate-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a sulfate-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + sulfateout 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + sulfatein
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and sulfate, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (sulfate-importing). This enzyme participates in abc transporters - general.
