   Hedgehog space      Hedgehog space   In mathematics , a hedgehog space is a topological space , consisting of a set of spines joined at a point.  For any cardinal number    K   K   K   , the   K   K   K   -hedgehog space is formed by taking the disjoint union of   K   K   K   real unit intervals identified at the origin. Each unit interval is referred to as one of the hedgehog's spines. A   K   K   K   -hedgehog space is sometimes called a hedgehog space of spininess   K   K   K    .  The hedgehog space is a metric space , when endowed with the hedgehog metric      d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   |   x  -  y   |         d   x  y        x  y      d(x,y)=|x-y|   if   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   lie in the same spine, and by     d   (  x  ,  y  )    =   x  +  y         d   x  y      x  y     d(x,y)=x+y   if   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   lie in different spines. Although their disjoint union makes the origins of the intervals distinct, the metric identifies them by assigning them 0 distance.  Hedgehog spaces are examples of real trees . 1  Paris metric  The metric on the plane in which the distance between any two points is their Euclidean distance when the two points belong to a ray though the origin, and is otherwise the sum of the distances of the two points from the origin, is sometimes called the Paris metric 2 because navigation in this metric resembles that in the radial street plan of Paris . The Paris metric, restricted to the unit disk , is a hedgehog space where K is the cardinality of the continuum .  Kowalsky's theorem  Kowalsky's theorem, named after Hans-Joachim Kowalsky, 3 states that any metric space of weight    K   K   K   can be represented as a topological subspace of the product of countably many   K   K   K   -hedgehog spaces.
