   Portal:Electronics/Selected article/1      Portal:Electronics/Selected article/1    Ohm's law states that, in an electrical circuit , the current passing through a conductor, from one terminal point to another, is directly proportional to the potential difference (i.e. voltage drop or voltage ) across the two terminal points and inversely proportional to the resistance of the conductor between the two terminal points. The SI unit of current is the ampere ; that of potential difference is the volt ; and that of resistance is the ohm , equal to one volt per ampere.  In mathematical terms, this is written as:      I  =   V  R       I    V  R     I=\frac{V}{R}   ,  where I is the current, V is the potential difference, and R is a constant called the resistance ."
