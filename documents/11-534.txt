Phosphatidylinositol deacylase

In enzymology, a phosphatidylinositol deacylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-acylglycerophosphoinositol + a carboxylate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol and H2O, whereas its two products are 1-acylglycerophosphoinositol and carboxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-phosphatidyl-D-myo-inositol 2-acylhydrolase. Other names in common use include phosphatidylinositol phospholipase A2, and phospholipase A2.
