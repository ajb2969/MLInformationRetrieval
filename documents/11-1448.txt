Carboxyvinyl-carboxyphosphonate phosphorylmutase

In enzymology, a carboxyvinyl-carboxyphosphonate phosphorylmutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-carboxyvinyl carboxyphosphonate 
 
 
 
  3-(hydrohydroxyphosphoryl)pyruvate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 1-carboxyvinyl carboxyphosphonate, and two products, 3-(hydrohydroxyphosphoryl)pyruvate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-carboxyvinyl carboxyphosphonate phosphorylmutase (decarboxylating).
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
