Anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase

In enzymology, an anthocyanin 5-aromatic acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA + anthocyanidin-3,5-diglucoside 
 
 
 
  CoA + anthocyanidin 3-glucoside-5-hydroxycinnamoylglucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA and anthocyanidin-3,5-diglucoside, whereas its two products are CoA and anthocyanidin 3-glucoside-5-hydroxycinnamoylglucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydroxycinnamoyl-CoA:anthocyanidin 3,5-diglucoside 5-O-glucoside-6"'-O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase.
