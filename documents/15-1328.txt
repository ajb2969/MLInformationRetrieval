   Flavonoid 4'-O-methyltransferase      Flavonoid 4'-O-methyltransferase   Flavonoid 4'-O-methyltransferase (, SOMT-2 , 4'-hydroxyisoflavone methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:flavonoid 4'-O-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 4'-hydroxyflavanone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 4'-methoxyflavanone   The enzyme catalyses the 4'- methylation of naringenin .
