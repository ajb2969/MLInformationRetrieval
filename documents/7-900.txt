   Extension (predicate logic)      Extension (predicate logic)   The extension of a predicate a truth-valued  function is the set of tuples of values that, used as arguments, satisfy the predicate. Such a set of tuples is a relation .  For example the statement " d2 is the weekday following d1 " can be seen as a truth function associating to each tuple ( d2 , d1 ) the value true or false . The extension of this truth function is, by convention, the set of all such tuples associated with the value true , i.e.  {(Monday, Sunday),  (Tuesday, Monday),  (Wednesday, Tuesday),  (Thursday, Wednesday),  (Friday, Thursday),  (Saturday, Friday),  (Sunday, Saturday)}  By examining this extension we can conclude that "Tuesday is the weekday following Saturday" (for example) is false.  Using set-builder notation , the extension of the n -ary predicate   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   can be written as       {   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   ∣   Φ   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    }   .     conditional-set    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      normal-Φ    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       \{(x_{1},...,x_{n})\mid\Phi(x_{1},...,x_{n})\}\,.     Relationship with characteristic function  If the values 0 and 1 in the range of a characteristic function are identified with the values false and true, respectivelymaking the characteristic function a predicate, then for all relations R and predicates   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   the following two statements are equivalent:      Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is the characteristic function of R ;  R is the extension of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   .
