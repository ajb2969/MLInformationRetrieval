   TRNA (adenine22-N1)-methyltransferase      TRNA (adenine22-N1)-methyltransferase   TRNA (adenine 22 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, TrmK , YqfN , Sp1610 (gene) , tRNA: m1A22 methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine 22 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 22 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 -methyladenine 22 in tRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates adenine 22 in tRNA.
