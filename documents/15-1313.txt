TRNA (adenine22-N1)-methyltransferase

TRNA (adenine22-N1)-methyltransferase (, TrmK, YqfN, Sp1610 (gene), tRNA: m1A22 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (adenine22-N1)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine22 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methyladenine22 in tRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates adenine22 in tRNA.
