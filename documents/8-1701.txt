   Literal (mathematical logic)      Literal (mathematical logic)   In mathematical logic , a literal is an atomic formula (atom) or its negation . The definition mostly appears in proof theory (of classical logic ), e.g. in conjunctive normal form and the method of resolution .  Literals can be divided into two types:   A positive literal is just an atom.  A negative literal is the negation of an atom.   For a literal   l   l   l   , the complementary literal is a literal corresponding to the negation of   l   l   l   , we can write    l  ¯     normal-¯  l    \bar{l}   to denote the complementary literal of   l   l   l   . More precisely, if    l  ≡  x      l  x    l\equiv x   then    l  ¯     normal-¯  l    \bar{l}   is    ¬  x       x    \lnot x   and if    l  ≡   ¬  x       l     x     l\equiv\lnot x   then    l  ¯     normal-¯  l    \bar{l}   is   x   x   x   .  In the context of a formula in the conjunctive normal form , a literal is pure if the literal's complement does not appear in the formula.  Examples  In propositional calculus a literal is simply a propositional variable or its negation.  In predicate calculus a literal is an atomic formula or its negation, where an atomic formula is a predicate symbol applied to some terms ,    P   (   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   )       P    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      P(t_{1},\ldots,t_{n})   with the terms recursively defined starting from constant symbols, variable symbols, and function symbols. For example,    ¬  Q   (   f   (   g   (  x  )    ,  y  ,  2  )    ,  x  )        Q     f     g  x   y  2    x     \neg Q(f(g(x),y,2),x)   is a negative literal with the constant symbol 2, the variable symbols x , y , the function symbols f , g , and the predicate symbol Q .
