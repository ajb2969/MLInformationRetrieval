Ring of mixed characteristic

In commutative algebra, a ring of mixed characteristic is a commutative ring 
 
 
 
  having characteristic zero and having an ideal 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  has positive characteristic.1
Examples

The integers 
 
 
 
  have characteristic zero, but for any prime number

 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a finite field with 
 
 
 
  elements and hence has characteristic 
 
 
 
 .
The ring of integers of any number field is of mixed characteristic
Fix a prime p and localize the integers at the prime ideal (p). The resulting ring Z(p) has characteristic zero. It has a unique maximal ideal pZ(p), and the quotient Z(p)/pZ(p) is a finite field with p elements. In contrast to the previous example, the only possible characteristics for rings of the form  are zero (when I is the zero ideal) and powers of p (when I is any other non-unit ideal); it is not possible to have a quotient of any other characteristic.
If 
 
 
 
  is a non-zero prime ideal of the ring 
 
 
 
  of integers of a number field 
 
 
 
  then the localization of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is likewise of mixed characteristic.
The p-adic integers Zp for any prime p are a ring of characteristic zero. However, they have an ideal generated by the image of the prime number p under the canonical map . The quotient Zp/pZp is again the finite field of p elements. Zp is an example of a complete discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic.
The integers, the ring of integers of any number field, and any localization or completion of one of these rings is a characteristic zero Dedekind domain.
