   Ring of mixed characteristic      Ring of mixed characteristic   In commutative algebra , a ring of mixed characteristic is a commutative ring   R   R   R   having characteristic zero and having an ideal   I   I   I   such that    R  /  I      R  I    R/I   has positive characteristic. 1  Examples   The integers   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   have characteristic zero, but for any prime number    p   p   p   ,     𝔽  p   =    ℤ  /  p   ℤ        subscript  𝔽  p       ℤ  p   ℤ     \mathbb{F}_{p}=\mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}   is a finite field with   p   p   p   elements and hence has characteristic   p   p   p   .  The ring of integers of any number field is of mixed characteristic  Fix a prime p and localize the integers at the prime ideal ( p ). The resulting ring Z ( p ) has characteristic zero. It has a unique maximal ideal p Z ( p ) , and the quotient Z ( p ) / p Z ( p ) is a finite field with p elements. In contrast to the previous example, the only possible characteristics for rings of the form are zero (when I is the zero ideal) and powers of p (when I is any other non-unit ideal); it is not possible to have a quotient of any other characteristic.  If   P   P   P   is a non-zero prime ideal of the ring    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    \mathcal{O}_{K}   of integers of a number field   K   K   K   then the localization of    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    \mathcal{O}_{K}   at   P   P   P   is likewise of mixed characteristic.  The p -adic integers  Z p for any prime p are a ring of characteristic zero. However, they have an ideal generated by the image of the prime number p under the canonical map . The quotient Z p / p Z p is again the finite field of p elements. Z p is an example of a complete  discrete valuation ring of mixed characteristic.  The integers, the ring of integers of any number field, and any localization or completion of one of these rings is a characteristic zero Dedekind domain .
