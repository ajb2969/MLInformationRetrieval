Jurin's law

 Jurin's law describes the rise and fall of a liquid within a thin capillary tube. Named after its discoverer James Jurin.
This law is expressed as:



where

h is the liquid height ;
γ is the liquid surface tension ;
θ is the contact angle of the liquid on the tube wall ;
ρ is the liquid density ;
r is the tube radius ;
g is the gravitational acceleration.

This law is valid if the tube radius is smaller than the capillary length.
