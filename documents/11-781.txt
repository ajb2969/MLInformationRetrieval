   Protein-glutamine glutaminase      Protein-glutamine glutaminase   In enzymology , a protein-glutamine glutaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   protein L-glutamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   protein L-glutamate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are protein L-glutamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are protein L-glutamate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is protein-L-glutamine amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include peptidoglutaminase II , glutaminyl-peptide glutaminase , destabilase , and peptidylglutaminase II .
