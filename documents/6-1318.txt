   Black brane      Black brane   In general relativity , a black brane is a solution of the equations that generalizes a black hole solution but it is also extended —and translationally symmetric— in p additional spatial dimensions. That type of solution would be called a black p -brane. (http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/black+brane)  In string theory , the solutions labeled as black branes provide us with an alternative description of the same objects called p-branes . Other descriptions of the same objects include D-branes . Some approximations of black branes might lead to entropy consistent with energy, from E=mc 2 .  The metric for a black p-brane in a n-dimensional space-time is:       d   s  2    =     (    η   a  b    +     r  s   n  -  p  -  3     r   n  -  p  -  3      u  a    u  b     )   d   σ  a   d   σ  b    +     (   1  -    r  s   n  -  p  -  3     r   n  -  p  -  3      )    -  1    d   r  2    +    r  2   d   Ω   n  -  p  -  2   2           d   superscript  s  2           subscript  η    a  b         superscript   subscript  r  s     n  p  3     superscript  r    n  p  3      subscript  u  a    subscript  u  b     d   superscript  σ  a   d   superscript  σ  b       superscript    1     superscript   subscript  r  s     n  p  3     superscript  r    n  p  3        1    d   superscript  r  2       superscript  r  2   d   subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  2     n  p  2        {ds}^{2}=\left(\eta_{ab}+\frac{r_{s}^{n-p-3}}{r^{n-p-3}}u_{a}u_{b}\right)d%
