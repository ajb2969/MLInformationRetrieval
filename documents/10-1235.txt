(S)-mandelate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a (S)-mandelate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate + acceptor 
 
 
 
  2-oxo-2-phenylacetate + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate and acceptor, whereas its two products are 2-oxo-2-phenylacetate and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-hydroxy-2-phenylacetate:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called MDH.
