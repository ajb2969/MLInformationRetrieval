N-acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase




N-acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase

In enzymology, a N-acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CTP + N-acylneuraminate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + CMP-N-acylneuraminate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CTP and N-acylneuraminate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and CMP-N-acylneuraminate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is CTP:N-acylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase. Other names in common use include CMP-sialate pyrophosphorylase, CMP-sialate synthase, cytidine 5'-monophosphosialic acid synthetase, CMP-Neu5Ac synthetase, CMP-NeuAc synthetase, acylneuraminate cytidyltransferase, CMP-N-acetylneuraminate synthetase, CMP-N-acetylneuraminate synthase, CMP-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthase, CMP-NANA synthetase, CMP-sialate synthetase, CMP-sialic synthetase, cytidine 5'-monophospho-N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase, cytidine 5-monophosphate N-acetylneuraminic acid synthetase, cytidine monophosphosialic acid synthetase, cytidine monophosphoacetylneuraminic synthetase, cytidine monophosphosialate pyrophosphorylase, cytidine monophosphosialate synthetase, and acetylneuraminate cytidylyltransferase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
