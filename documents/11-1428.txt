   ADP-specific glucokinase      ADP-specific glucokinase   In enzymology , an ADP-specific glucokinase () also known as ADP-dependent glucokinase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP + D-glucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + D-glucose 6-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP and D-glucose , whereas its two products are AMP and D-glucose 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor.  In humans, the ADP-dependent glucokinase is encoded by the ADPGK  gene . 1  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
