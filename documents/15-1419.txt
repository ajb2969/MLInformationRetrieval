Matroid polytope

In mathematics, a matroid polytope, also called a matroid basis polytope or basis matroid polytope to distinguish it from other polytopes derived from a matroid, is a polytope constructed via the bases of a matroid. Given a matroid 
 
 
 
 , the matroid polytope 
 
 
 
  is the convex hull of the indicator vectors of the bases of 
 
 
 
 .
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a matroid on 
 
 
 
  elements. Given a basis 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , the indicator vector of 
 
 
 
  is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the standard 
 
 
 
 th unit vector in 
 
 
 
 . The matroid polytope

 
  is the convex hull of the set



Examples
 

Let 
 
 
 
  be the rank 2 matroid on 4 elements with bases








That is, all 2-element subsets of 
 
 
 
  except 
 
 
 
 . The corresponding indicator vectors of 
 
 
 
  are
 
 



The matroid polytope of 
 
 
 
  is
 



which is the square pyramid.
 


Let 
 
 
 
  be the rank 2 matroid on 4 elements with bases that are all 2-element subsets of 
 
 
 
 . The corresponding matroid polytope 
 
 
 
  is the octahedron. Observe that the polytope 
 
 
 
  from the previous example is contained in 
 
 
 
 .


If 
 
 
 
  is the uniform matroid of rank 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  elements, then the matroid polytope 
 
 
 
  is the hypersimplex

 
 .1

Properties

A matroid polytope is contained in the hypersimplex

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the rank of the associated matroid and 
 
 
 
  is the size of the ground set of the associated matroid.2


Every edge of a matroid polytope 
 
 
 
  is a parallel translate of 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 , the ground set of the associated matroid. In other words, the edges of 
 
 
 
  correspond exactly to the pairs of bases 
 
 
 
  that satisfy the basis exchange property

 
  for some

Matroid polytopes are members of the family of generalized permutohedra.4


Let 
 
 
 
  be the rank function of a matroid 
 
 
 
 . The matroid polytope 
 
 
 
  can be written uniquely as a signed Minkowski sum of simplices:5








where 
 
 
 
  is the ground set of the matroid 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the signed beta invariant of

The independence matroid polytope is the convex hull of the set


 
  The (basis) matroid polytope is a face of the independence matroid polytope. Given the rank

 
  of a matroid 
 
 
 
 , the independence matroid polytope is equal to the polymatroid determined by

Flag matroid polytope
The flag matroid polytope is another polytope constructed from the bases of matroids. A flag

 
  is a strictly increasing sequence



of finite sets.6 Let 
 
 
 
  be the cardinality of the set 
 
 
 
 . Two matroids 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are said to be concordant if their rank functions satisfy



Given pairwise concordant matroids 
 
 
 
  on the ground set 
 
 
 
  with ranks 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a basis of the matroid 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Such a collection of flags is a flag matroid

 
 . The matroids 
 
 
 
  are called the constituents of 
 
 
 
 . For each flag 
 
 
 
  in a flag matroid 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the sum of the indicator vectors of each basis in 
 
 




Given a flag matroid 
 
 
 
 , the flag matroid polytope

 
  is the convex hull of the set


 
  A flag matroid polytope can be written as a Minkowski sum of the (basis) matroid polytopes of the constituent matroids:7
$$P_\mathcal{F} = P_{M_1} + \cdots + P_{M_k}. \,$$
