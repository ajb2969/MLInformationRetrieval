Jackson integral

In q-analog theory, the Jackson integral series in the theory of special functions that expresses the operation inverse to q-differentiation.
The Jackson integral was introduced by Frank Hilton Jackson.
Definition
Let f(x) be a function of a real variable x. The Jackson integral of f is defined by the following series expansion:



More generally, if g(x) is another function and Dqg denotes its q-derivative, we can formally write


 
  or



giving a q-analogue of the Riemann–Stieltjes integral.
Jackson integral as q-antiderivative
Just as the ordinary antiderivative of a continuous function can be represented by its Riemann integral, it is possible to show that the Jackson integral gives a unique q-antiderivative within a certain class of functions, see,1 2
Theorem
Suppose that 
 
 
 
 
  is bounded on the interval 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  then the Jackson integral converges to a function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  which is a q-antiderivative of 
 
 
 
 
  Moreover, 
 
 
 
  is continuous at 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and is a unique antiderivative of $f(x)$ in this class of functions.3
