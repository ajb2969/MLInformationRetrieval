   Blood group B linear chain alpha-1,3-galactosidase      Blood group B linear chain alpha-1,3-galactosidase   Baicalin-beta-D-glucuronidase (, baicalinase ) is an enzyme with system name 5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone-7-O-beta-D-glucupyranosiduronate glucuronosylhydrolase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   baicalin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    baicalein + D- glucuronate    The enzyme also hydrolyses wogonin 7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and oroxylin 7-O-beta-D-glucuronide with lower efficiency.
