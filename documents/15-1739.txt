Blood group B linear chain alpha-1,3-galactosidase

Baicalin-beta-D-glucuronidase (, baicalinase) is an enzyme with system name 5,6,7-trihydroxyflavone-7-O-beta-D-glucupyranosiduronate glucuronosylhydrolase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

baicalin + H2O 
 
 
baicalein + D-glucuronate


The enzyme also hydrolyses wogonin 7-O-beta-D-glucuronide and oroxylin 7-O-beta-D-glucuronide with lower efficiency.
