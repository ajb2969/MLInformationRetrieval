   Allantoate deiminase      Allantoate deiminase   In enzymology , an allantoate deiminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   allantoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ureidoglycine + NH 3 + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are allantoate and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are ureidoglycine , NH 3 , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is allantoate amidinohydrolase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme is also called allantoate amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .
