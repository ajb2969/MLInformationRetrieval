Allantoate deiminase

In enzymology, an allantoate deiminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

allantoate + H2O 
 
 
 
  ureidoglycine + NH3 + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are allantoate and H2O, whereas its 3 products are ureidoglycine, NH3, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is allantoate amidinohydrolase (decarboxylating). This enzyme is also called allantoate amidohydrolase. This enzyme participates in purine metabolism.
