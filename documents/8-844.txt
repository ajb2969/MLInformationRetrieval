   Control-Lyapunov function      Control-Lyapunov function   In control theory , a control-Lyapunov function 1 is a Lyapunov function     V   (  x  )       V  x    V(x)   for a system with control inputs. The ordinary Lyapunov function is used to test whether a dynamical system is stable (more restrictively, asymptotically stable ). That is, whether the system starting in a state    x  ≠  0      x  0    x\neq 0   in some domain D will remain in D , or for asymptotic stability will eventually return to    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   . The control-Lyapunov function is used to test whether a system is feedback stabilizable , that is whether for any state x there exists a control    u   (  x  ,  t  )       u   x  t     u(x,t)   such that the system can be brought to the zero state by applying the control u .  More formally, suppose we are given an autonomous dynamical system       x  ˙   =   f   (  x  ,  u  )         normal-˙  x     f   x  u      \dot{x}=f(x,u)   where    x  ∈   𝐑  n       x   superscript  𝐑  n     x\in\mathbf{R}^{n}   is the state vector and    u  ∈   𝐑  m       u   superscript  𝐑  m     u\in\mathbf{R}^{m}   is the control vector, and we want to feedback stabilize it to    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   in some domain    D  ⊂   𝐑  n       D   superscript  𝐑  n     D\subset\mathbf{R}^{n}   .  Definition. A control-Lyapunov function is a function    V  :   D  →  𝐑      normal-:  V   normal-→  D  𝐑     V:D\rightarrow\mathbf{R}   that is continuously differentiable, positive-definite (that is    V   (  x  )       V  x    V(x)   is positive except at    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   where it is zero), and such that        ∀  x   ≠   0  ,   ∃  u        V  ˙    (  x  ,  u  )    =      ∇  V    (  x  )    ⋅  f    (  x  ,  u  )    <  0.      formulae-sequence     for-all  x    0    u            normal-˙  V    x  u       normal-⋅     normal-∇  V   x   f    x  u         0.      \forall x\neq 0,\exists u\qquad\dot{V}(x,u)=\nabla V(x)\cdot f(x,u)<0.     The last condition is the key condition; in words it says that for each state x we can find a control u that will reduce the "energy" V . Intuitively, if in each state we can always find a way to reduce the energy, we should eventually be able to bring the energy to zero, that is to bring the system to a stop. This is made rigorous by the following result:  Artstein's theorem. The dynamical system has a differentiable control-Lyapunov function if and only if there exists a regular stabilizing feedback u ( x ).  It may not be easy to find a control-Lyapunov function for a given system, but if we can find one thanks to some ingenuity and luck, then the feedback stabilization problem simplifies considerably, in fact it reduces to solving a static non-linear programming problem        u  *    (  x  )    =      arg   min  u     ∇  V    (  x  )    ⋅  f    (  x  ,  u  )           superscript  u    x      normal-⋅       subscript   u     normal-∇  V   x   f    x  u      u^{*}(x)=\arg\min_{u}\nabla V(x)\cdot f(x,u)   for each state x .  The theory and application of control-Lyapunov functions were developed by Z. Artstein and E. D. Sontag in the 1980s and 1990s.  Example  Here is a characteristic example of applying a Lyapunov candidate function to a control problem.  Consider the non-linear system, which is a mass-spring-damper system with spring hardening and position dependent mass described by        m   (   1  +   q  2    )    q  ¨    +   b   q  ˙    +    K  0   q   +    K  1    q  3     =  u          m    1   superscript  q  2     normal-¨  q      b   normal-˙  q       subscript  K  0   q      subscript  K  1    superscript  q  3     u    m(1+q^{2})\ddot{q}+b\dot{q}+K_{0}q+K_{1}q^{3}=u   Now given the desired state,    q  d     subscript  q  d    q_{d}   , and actual state,   q   q   q   , with error,    e  =    q  d   -  q       e     subscript  q  d   q     e=q_{d}-q   , define a function   r   r   r   as      r  =    e  ˙   +   α  e        r     normal-˙  e     α  e      r=\dot{e}+\alpha e   A Control-Lyapunov candidate is then      V  =    1  2    r  2        V      1  2    superscript  r  2      V=\frac{1}{2}r^{2}   which is positive definite for all    q  ≠  0      q  0    q\neq 0   ,     q  ˙   ≠  0       normal-˙  q   0    \dot{q}\neq 0   .  Now taking the time derivative of   V   V   V          V  ˙   =   r   r  ˙         normal-˙  V     r   normal-˙  r      \dot{V}=r\dot{r}          V  ˙   =    (    e  ˙   +   α  e    )    (    e  ¨   +   α   e  ˙     )         normal-˙  V        normal-˙  e     α  e       normal-¨  e     α   normal-˙  e        \dot{V}=(\dot{e}+\alpha e)(\ddot{e}+\alpha\dot{e})     The goal is to get the time derivative to be       V  ˙   =   -   κ  V         normal-˙  V       κ  V      \dot{V}=-\kappa V   which is globally exponentially stable if   V   V   V   is globally positive definite (which it is).  Hence we want the rightmost bracket of    V  ˙     normal-˙  V    \dot{V}   ,       (    e  ¨   +   α   e  ˙     )   =   (      q  ¨   d   -   q  ¨    +   α   e  ˙     )          normal-¨  e     α   normal-˙  e          subscript   normal-¨  q   d    normal-¨  q      α   normal-˙  e       (\ddot{e}+\alpha\dot{e})=(\ddot{q}_{d}-\ddot{q}+\alpha\dot{e})   to fulfill the requirement       (      q  ¨   d   -   q  ¨    +   α   e  ˙     )   =   -    κ  2    (    e  ˙   +   α  e    )              subscript   normal-¨  q   d    normal-¨  q      α   normal-˙  e           κ  2      normal-˙  e     α  e        (\ddot{q}_{d}-\ddot{q}+\alpha\dot{e})=-\frac{\kappa}{2}(\dot{e}+\alpha e)   which upon substitution of the dynamics,    q  ¨     normal-¨  q    \ddot{q}   , gives       (      q  ¨   d   -    u  -    K  0   q   -    K  1    q  3    -   b   q  ˙      m   (   1  +   q  2    )      +   α   e  ˙     )   =   -    κ  2    (    e  ˙   +   α  e    )              subscript   normal-¨  q   d       u     subscript  K  0   q      subscript  K  1    superscript  q  3      b   normal-˙  q       m    1   superscript  q  2         α   normal-˙  e           κ  2      normal-˙  e     α  e        (\ddot{q}_{d}-\frac{u-K_{0}q-K_{1}q^{3}-b\dot{q}}{m(1+q^{2})}+\alpha\dot{e})=-%
 \frac{\kappa}{2}(\dot{e}+\alpha e)   Solving for   u   u   u   yields the control law      u  =    m   (   1  +   q  2    )    (     q  ¨   d   +   α   e  ˙    +    κ  2   r    )    +    K  0   q   +    K  1    q  3    +   b   q  ˙         u      m    1   superscript  q  2       subscript   normal-¨  q   d     α   normal-˙  e        κ  2   r        subscript  K  0   q      subscript  K  1    superscript  q  3      b   normal-˙  q       u=m(1+q^{2})(\ddot{q}_{d}+\alpha\dot{e}+\frac{\kappa}{2}r)+K_{0}q+K_{1}q^{3}+b%
 \dot{q}   with   κ   κ   \kappa   and   α   α   \alpha   , both greater than zero, as tunable parameters  This control law will guarantee global exponential stability since upon substitution into the time derivative yields, as expected       V  ˙   =   -   κ  V         normal-˙  V       κ  V      \dot{V}=-\kappa V   which is a linear first order differential equation which has solution      V  =   V   (  0  )    e   -   κ  t          V    V  0   superscript  e      κ  t        V=V(0)e^{-\kappa t}     And hence the error and error rate, remembering that    V  =    1  2     (    e  ˙   +   α  e    )   2        V      1  2    superscript     normal-˙  e     α  e    2      V=\frac{1}{2}(\dot{e}+\alpha e)^{2}   , exponentially decay to zero.  If you wish to tune a particular response from this, it is necessary to substitute back into the solution we derived for   V   V   V   and solve for   e   e   e   . This is left as an exercise for the reader but the first few steps at the solution are:       r   r  ˙    =   -    κ  2    r  2           r   normal-˙  r          κ  2    superscript  r  2       r\dot{r}=-\frac{\kappa}{2}r^{2}          r  ˙   =   -    κ  2   r         normal-˙  r         κ  2   r      \dot{r}=-\frac{\kappa}{2}r         r  =   r   (  0  )    e   -    κ  2   t          r    r  0   superscript  e        κ  2   t        r=r(0)e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2}t}           e  ˙   +   α  e    =    (     e  ˙    (  0  )    +   α  e   (  0  )     )    e   -    κ  2   t             normal-˙  e     α  e           normal-˙  e   0     α  e  0     superscript  e        κ  2   t        \dot{e}+\alpha e=(\dot{e}(0)+\alpha e(0))e^{-\frac{\kappa}{2}t}   which can then be solved using any linear differential equation methods.
