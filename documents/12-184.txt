Frobenius solution to the hypergeometric equation




Frobenius solution to the hypergeometric equation

In the following we solve the second-order differential equation called the hypergeometric differential equation using Frobenius method, named after Ferdinand Georg Frobenius. This is a method that uses the series solution for a differential equation, where we assume the solution takes the form of a series. This is usually the method we use for complicated ordinary differential equations.
The solution of the hypergeometric differential equation is very important. For instance, Legendre's differential equation can be shown to be a special case of the hypergeometric differential equation. Hence, by solving the hypergeometric differential equation, one may directly compare its solutions to get the solutions of Legendre's differential equation, after making the necessary substitutions. For more details, please check the hypergeometric differential equation.
We shall prove that this equation has three singularities, namely at x = 0, x = 1 and around infinity. However, as these will turn out to be regular singular points, we will be able to assume a solution on the form of a series. Since this is a second-order differential equation, we must have two linearly independent solutions.
The problem however will be that our assumed solutions may or not be independent, or worse, may not even be defined (depending on the value of the parameters of the equation). This is why we shall study the different cases for the parameters and modify our assumed solution accordingly.
The equation
Solve the hypergeometric equation around all singularities:



== Solution around x = 0 == Let



Then



Hence, x = 0 and x = 1 are singular points. Let's start with x = 0. To see if it is regular, we study the following limits:



Hence, both limits exist and x = 0 is a regular singular point. Therefore, we assume the solution takes the form



with a0 ≠ 0. Hence,



Substituting these into the hypergeometric equation, we get



That is,



In order to simplify this equation, we need all powers to be the same, equal to r + c − 1, the smallest power. Hence, we switch the indices as follows:



Thus, isolating the first term of the sums starting from 0 we get



Now, from the linear independence of all powers of x, that is, of the functions 1, x, x2, etc., the coefficients of xk vanish for all k. Hence, from the first term, we have



which is the indicial equation. Since a0 ≠ 0, we have



Hence,



Also, from the rest of the terms, we have



Hence,



But



Hence, we get the recurrence relation



Let's now simplify this relation by giving ar in terms of a0 instead of ar−1. From the recurrence relation (note: below, expressions of the form (u)r refer to the Pochhammer symbol).



As we can see,



Hence, our assumed solution takes the form



We are now ready to study the solutions corresponding to the different cases for c1 − c2 = γ − 1 (this reduces to studying the nature of the parameter γ: whether it is an integer or not).

Then y1 = y|c = 0 and y2 = y|c = 1 − γ. Since


 
  we have


 
 
  Hence, 
 
 
 
  Let A′ a0 = a and B′ a0 = B. Then



=== γ = 1 === Then y1 = y|c = 0. Since γ = 1, we have


 
  Hence,


 
 
  To calculate this derivative, let


 
  Then


 
  But


 
  Hence,


 
 
  Differentiating both sides of the equation with respect to c, we get:


 
  Hence,


 
  Now,


 
  Hence,


 
 
  For c = 0, we get


 
  Hence, y = C′y1 + D′y2. Let C′a0 = C and D′a0 = D. Then



γ an integer and γ ≠ 1
γ ≤ 0
From the recurrence relation


 
  we see that when c = 0 (the smaller root), a1 − γ → ∞. Hence, we must make the substitution a0 = b0 (c - ci), where ci is the root for which our solution is infinite. Hence, we take a0 = b0 c and our assumed solution takes the new form


 
  Then y1 = yb|c = 0. As we can see, all terms before


 
  vanish because of the c in the numerator. Starting from this term however, the c in the numerator vanishes. To see this, note that


 
  Hence, our solution takes the form


 
 
  Now,


 
  To calculate this derivative, let


 
  Then following the method in the previous case, we get


 
  Now,


 
  Hence,


 
 
  Hence,


 
  At c = 1 − γ, we get y2. Hence, y = E′ y1 + F′ y2. Let E′ b0 = E and F′ b0 = F. Then



γ > 1
From the recurrence relation


 
  we see that when c = 1 - γ (the smaller root), aγ−1 → ∞. Hence, we must make the substitution a0 = b0(c − ci), where ci is the root for which our solution is infinite. Hence, we take a0 = b0(c + γ - 1) and our assumed solution takes the new form:


 
  Then y1 = yb|c = 1 - γ. All terms before


 
  vanish because of the c + γ - 1 in the numerator. Starting from this term, however, the c + γ - 1 in the numerator vanishes. To see this, note that


 
  Hence, our solution takes the form


 
 
  Now,


 
  To calculate this derivative, let


 
  Then following the method in the second case above,


 
  Now,


 
  Hence,


 
 
  At c = 0 we get y2. Hence, y = G′y1 + H′y2. Let G′b0 = E and H′b0 = F. Then



== Solution around x = 1 == Let us now study the singular point x = 1. To see if it is regular,


 
 
  Hence, both limits exist and x = 1 is a regular singular point. Now, instead of assuming a solution on the form


 
  we will try to express the solutions of this case in terms of the solutions for the point x = 0. We proceed as follows: we had the hypergeometric equation


 
  Let z = 1 − x. Then


 
 
  Hence, the equation takes the form


 
  Since z = 1 − x, the solution of the hypergeometric equation at x = 1 is the same as the solution for this equation at z = 0. But the solution at z = 0 is identical to the solution we obtained for the point x = 0, if we replace each γ by α + β − γ + 1. Hence, to get the solutions, we just make this substitution in the previous results. Note also that for x = 0, c1 = 0 and c2 = 1 − γ. Hence, in our case, c1 = 0 while c2 = γ − α − β. Let us now write the solutions. In the following we replaced each z by 1 - x.
Analysis of the solution in terms of the difference γ − α − β of the two roots
To simplify notation from now on denote γ − α − β by Δ, therefore γ = Δ + α + β.

Solution around infinity
Finally, we study the singularity as x → ∞. Since we can't study this directly, we let x = s−1. Then the solution of the equation as x → ∞ is identical to the solution of the modified equation when s = 0. We had



Hence, the equation takes the new form



which reduces to



Let



As we said, we shall only study the solution when s = 0. As we can see, this is a singular point since P2(0) = 0. To see if it is regular,



Hence, both limits exist and s = 0 is a regular singular point. Therefore, we assume the solution takes the form



with a0 ≠ 0. Hence,



Substituting in the modified hypergeometric equation we get



And therefore:



i.e.,



In order to simplify this equation, we need all powers to be the same, equal to r + c, the smallest power. Hence, we switch the indices as follows



Thus, isolating the first term of the sums starting from 0 we get



Now, from the linear independence of all powers of s (i.e., of the functions 1, s, s2, ...), the coefficients of sk vanish for all k. Hence, from the first term we have



which is the indicial equation. Since a0 ≠ 0, we have



Hence, c1 = α and c2 = β.
Also, from the rest of the terms we have



Hence,



But



Hence, we get the recurrence relation



Let's now simplify this relation by giving ar in terms of a0 instead of ar−1. From the recurrence relation,



As we can see,



Hence, our assumed solution takes the form



We are now ready to study the solutions corresponding to the different cases for c1 − c2 = α − β.

Then y1 = y|c = α and y2 = y|c = β. Since



we have



Hence, y = A′y1 + B′y2. Let A′a0 = A and B′a0 = B. Then, noting that s = x−1,



===α − β = 0=== Then y1 = y|c = α. Since α = β, we have



Hence,



To calculate this derivative, let



Then using the method in the case γ = 1 above, we get



Now,



Hence,



Therefore:



Hence, y = C′y1 + D′y2. Let C′a0 = C and D′a0 = D. Noting that s = x−1,



α − β an integer and α − β ≠ 0
α − β > 0
From the recurrence relation



we see that when c = β (the smaller root), aα−β → ∞. Hence, we must make the substitution a0 = b0(c − ci), where ci is the root for which our solution is infinite. Hence, we take a0 = b0(c − β) and our assumed solution takes the new form



Then y1 = yb|c = β. As we can see, all terms before



vanish because of the c − β in the numerator.
But starting from this term, the c − β in the numerator vanishes. To see this, note that



Hence, our solution takes the form



Now,



To calculate this derivative, let



Then using the method in the case γ = 1 above we get



Now,



Hence,



Hence,



At c = α we get y2. Hence, y = E′y1 + F′y2. Let E′b0 = E and F′b0 = F. Noting that s = x−1 we get
