Zhao Youqin's π algorithm

 
Zhao Youqin's 
 
 
 
  algorithm was an algorithm by Yuan dynasty astronomer-mathematician Zhao Youqin (, ? – 1330) to calculate the value of 

 in his book Ge Xiang Xin Shu ().
Algorithm
Zhao Youqin started with an inscribed square in a circle with radius r.1
If 
 
 
 
  denotes the length of a side of the square, draw a perpendicular line d from the center of the circle to side l. Let e denotes r − d. Then from the diagram:






Extend the perpendicular line d to dissect the circle into an octagon; 
 
 
 
  denotes the length of one side of octagon.






let 
 
 
 
  denotes the length of a side of hexadecagon



similarly



Proceeding in this way, he at last calculated the side of a 16384-gon, multiplying it by 16384 to obtain 3141.592 for a circle with diameter = 1000 units, or



He multiplied this number by 113 and obtained 355. From this he deduced that of the traditional values of 
 
 
 
 , that is 3, 3.14, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the last is the most exact.2
