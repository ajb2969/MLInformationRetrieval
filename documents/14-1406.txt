   Knaster's condition      Knaster's condition   In mathematics , a partially ordered set  P is said to have Knaster's condition upwards (sometimes property (K) ) if any uncountable subset A of P has an upwards-linked uncountable subset. An analogous definition applies to Knaster's condition downwards .  The property is named after Polish  mathematician  Bronisław Knaster .  Knaster's condition implies a countable chain condition (ccc), and it is sometimes used in conjunction with a weaker form of Martin's axiom , where the ccc requirement is replaced with Knaster's condition. Not unlike ccc, Knaster's condition is also sometimes used as a property of a topological space , in which case it means that the topology (as in, the family of all open sets) with inclusion satisfies the condition.  Furthermore, assuming MA (    ω  1     subscript  ω  1    \omega_{1}   ), ccc implies Knaster's condition, making the two equivalent.  References     "  Category:Order theory
