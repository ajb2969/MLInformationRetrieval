   Segre surface      Segre surface   In algebraic geometry , a Segre surface , studied by  and , is an intersection of two quadrics in 4-dimensional projective space . They are rational surfaces isomorphic to a projective plane  blown up in 5 points with no 3 on a line, and are del Pezzo surfaces of degree 4, and have 16 rational lines. The term "Segre surface" is also occasionally used for various other surfaces, such as a quadric in 3-dimensional projective space, or the hypersurface         x  1    x  2    x  3    +    x  2    x  3    x  4    +    x  3    x  4    x  5    +    x  4    x  5    x  1    +    x  5    x  1    x  2     =   0.            subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3       subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3    subscript  x  4       subscript  x  3    subscript  x  4    subscript  x  5       subscript  x  4    subscript  x  5    subscript  x  1       subscript  x  5    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2     0.    x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}+x_{2}x_{3}x_{4}+x_{3}x_{4}x_{5}+x_{4}x_{5}x_{1}+x_{5}x_{1}x_{2%
