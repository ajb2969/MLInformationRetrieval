   Symmetric inverse semigroup      Symmetric inverse semigroup   __NOTOC__ In abstract algebra , the set of all partial bijections on a set X (aka one-to-one partial transformations) forms an inverse semigroup , called the symmetric inverse semigroup 1 (actually a monoid ) on X . The conventional notation for the symmetric inverse semigroup on a set X is    ‚Ñê  X     subscript  ‚Ñê  X    \mathcal{I}_{X}    2 or    ‚Ñê   ùíÆ  X       ‚Ñê   subscript  ùíÆ  X     \mathcal{IS}_{X}    3 In general    ‚Ñê  X     subscript  ‚Ñê  X    \mathcal{I}_{X}   is not commutative .  Details about the origin of the symmetric inverse semigroup are available in the discussion on the origins of the inverse semigroup .  Finite symmetric inverse semigroups  When X is a finite set {1, ..., n }, the inverse semigroup of one-one partial transformations is denoted by C n and its elements are called charts or partial symmetries . 4 The notion of chart generalizes the notion of permutation . A (famous) example of (sets of) charts are the hypomorphic mapping sets from the reconstruction conjecture in graph theory. 5  The cycle notation of classical, group-based permutations generalizes to symmetric inverse semigroups by the addition of a notion called a path , which (unlike a cycle) ends when it reaches the "undefined" element ; the notation thus extended is called path notation . 6  See also   Symmetric group   Notes  References   S.
