Spinor bundle

In differential geometry, given a spin structure on a 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Riemannian manifold

 
  one defines the spinor bundle to be the complex vector bundle

 
  associated to the corresponding principal bundle

 
  of spin frames over 
 
 
 
  and the spin representation of its structure group 
 
 
 
  on the space of spinors

 
 .
A section of the spinor bundle

 
  is called a spinor field.
Formal definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a spin structure on a Riemannian manifold

 
  that is, an equivariant lift of the oriented orthonormal frame bundle

 
  with respect to the double covering 
 
 

The spinor bundle

 
  is defined 1 to be the complex vector bundle


 
  associated to the spin structure

 
  via the spin representation

 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the group of unitary operators acting on a Hilbert space

 
  It is worth noting that the spin representation 
 
 
 
  is a faithful and unitary representation of the group
