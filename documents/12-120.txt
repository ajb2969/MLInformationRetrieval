   Ackermann ordinal      Ackermann ordinal   In mathematics, the Ackermann ordinal is a certain large countable ordinal , named after Wilhelm Ackermann . The term "Ackermann ordinal" is also occasionally used for the small Veblen ordinal , a somewhat larger ordinal.  Unfortunately there is no standard notation for ordinals beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal Γ 0 . Most systems of notation use symbols such as ψ(α), θ(α), ψ α (β), some of which are modifications of the Veblen functions to produce countable ordinals even for uncountable arguments, and some of which are " collapsing functions ".  The smaller Ackermann ordinal is the limit of a system of ordinal notations invented by , and is sometimes denoted by     ϕ   Ω  2     (  0  )        subscript  ϕ   superscript  normal-Ω  2    0    \phi_{{\Omega^{2}}}(0)   or    θ   (   Ω  2   )       θ   superscript  normal-Ω  2     \theta(\Omega^{2})   or    ψ   (   Ω   Ω  2    )       ψ   superscript  normal-Ω   superscript  normal-Ω  2      \psi(\Omega^{\Omega^{2}})   . Ackermann's system of notation is weaker than the system introduced much earlier by , which he seems to have been unaware of.  References       "  Category:Ordinal numbers
