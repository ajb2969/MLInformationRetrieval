(-)-alpha-terpineol synthase




(-)-alpha-terpineol synthase

(-)-alpha-terpineol synthase () is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (-)-alpha-terpineol-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  (-)-alpha-terpineol + diphosphate


The enzyme has been characterized from Vitis vinifera (grape).
