   Horseshoe lemma      Horseshoe lemma   In homological algebra , the horseshoe lemma , also called the simultaneous resolution theorem , is a statement relating resolutions of two objects    A  ‚Ä≤     superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤    A^{\prime}   and    A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤     superscript  A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤    A^{\prime\prime}   to resolutions of extensions of    A  ‚Ä≤     superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤    A^{\prime}   by    A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤     superscript  A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤    A^{\prime\prime}   . It says that if an object   A   A   A   is an extension of    A  ‚Ä≤     superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤    A^{\prime}   by    A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤     superscript  A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤    A^{\prime\prime}   , then a resolution of   A   A   A   can be built up inductively with the n th item in the resolution equal to the coproduct of the n th items in the resolutions of    A  ‚Ä≤     superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤    A^{\prime}   and    A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤     superscript  A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤    A^{\prime\prime}   . The name of the lemma comes from the shape of the diagram illustrating the lemma's hypothesis.  Formal statement  Let   ùíú   ùíú   \mathcal{A}   be an abelian category with enough projectives . If   (Figure)  Horseshoe lemma.png    is a diagram in   ùíú   ùíú   \mathcal{A}   such that the column is exact and the rows are projective resolutions of    A  ‚Ä≤     superscript  A  normal-‚Ä≤    A^{\prime}   and    A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤     superscript  A  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤    A^{\prime\prime}   respectively, then it can be completed to a commutative diagram   (Figure)  Horseshoe lemma conclusion.png    where all columns are exact, the middle row is a projective resolution of   A   A   A   , and     P  n   =    P  n  ‚Ä≤   ‚äï   P  n  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤         subscript  P  n    direct-sum   subscript   superscript  P  normal-‚Ä≤   n    subscript   superscript  P  ‚Ä≤‚Ä≤   n      P_{n}=P^{\prime}_{n}\oplus P^{\prime\prime}_{n}   for all n . If   ùíú   ùíú   \mathcal{A}   is an abelian category with enough injectives , the dual statement also holds.  The lemma can be proved inductively. At each stage of the induction, the properties of projective objects are used to define maps in a projective resolution of   A   A   A   . Then the snake lemma is invoked to show that the simultaneous resolution constructed so far has exact rows.
