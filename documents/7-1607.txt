Horseshoe lemma

In homological algebra, the horseshoe lemma, also called the simultaneous resolution theorem, is a statement relating resolutions of two objects 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to resolutions of extensions of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . It says that if an object 
 
 
 
  is an extension of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , then a resolution of 
 
 
 
  can be built up inductively with the nth item in the resolution equal to the coproduct of the nth items in the resolutions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The name of the lemma comes from the shape of the diagram illustrating the lemma's hypothesis.
Formal statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be an abelian category with enough projectives. If

is a diagram in 
 
 
 
  such that the column is exact and the rows are projective resolutions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively, then it can be completed to a commutative diagram

where all columns are exact, the middle row is a projective resolution of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  for all n. If 
 
 
 
  is an abelian category with enough injectives, the dual statement also holds.
The lemma can be proved inductively. At each stage of the induction, the properties of projective objects are used to define maps in a projective resolution of 
 
 
 
 . Then the snake lemma is invoked to show that the simultaneous resolution constructed so far has exact rows.
