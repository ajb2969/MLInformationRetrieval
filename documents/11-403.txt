   2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase      2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase   In enzymology , a 2',3'-cyclic-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nucleoside 3'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its product is nucleoside 3'-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nucleoside-2',3'-cyclic-phosphate 3'-nucleotidohydrolase . Other names in common use include ribonucleoside 2',3'-cyclic phosphate diesterase , 2',3 '-cyclic AMP phosphodiesterase , 2',3'-cyclic nucleotidase , cyclic 2',3'-nucleotide 2'-phosphodiesterase , cyclic 2',3'-nucleotide phosphodiesterase , 2',3'-cyclic nucleoside monophosphate phosphodiesterase , 2',3'-cyclic AMP 2'-phosphohydrolase , cyclic phosphodiesterase:3'-nucleotidase , 2',3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphohydrolase , 2':3'-cyclic phosphodiesterase , and 2':3'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase:3'-nucleotidase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism .  References         "  Category:EC 3.1.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
