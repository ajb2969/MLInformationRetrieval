Chevalley scheme

A Chevalley scheme in algebraic geometry was a precursor notion of scheme theory.
Let X be a separated integral noetherian scheme, R its function field. If we denote by 
 
 
 
  the set of subrings 
 
 
 
  of R, where x runs through X (when 
 
 
 
 , we denote 
 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 ), 
 
 
 
  verifies the following three properties

For each 
 
 
 
 , R is the field of fractions of M.
There is a finite set of noetherian subrings 
 
 
 
  of R so that 
 
 
 
 
  and that, for each pair of indices i,j, the subring 
 
 
 
  of R generated by 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -algebra of finite type.
If 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
  are such that the maximal ideal of M is contained in that of N, then M=N.

Originally, Chevalley also supposed that R was an extension of finite type of a field K and that the 
 
 
 
 's were algebras of finite type over a field too (this simplifies the second condition above).
