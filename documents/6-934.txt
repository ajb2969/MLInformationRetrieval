   Chevalley scheme      Chevalley scheme   A Chevalley scheme in algebraic geometry was a precursor notion of scheme theory .  Let X be a separated integral noetherian scheme , R its function field . If we denote by    X  ‚Ä≤     superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤    X^{\prime}   the set of subrings    ùí™  x     subscript  ùí™  x    \mathcal{O}_{x}   of R , where x runs through X (when    X  =   Spec   (  A  )        X    Spec  A     X=\mathrm{Spec}(A)   , we denote    X  ‚Ä≤     superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤    X^{\prime}   by    L   (  A  )       L  A    L(A)   ),    X  ‚Ä≤     superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤    X^{\prime}   verifies the following three properties   For each    M  ‚àà   X  ‚Ä≤       M   superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤     M\in X^{\prime}   , R is the field of fractions of M .  There is a finite set of noetherian subrings    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   of R so that     X  ‚Ä≤   =    ‚à™  i    L   (   A  i   )          superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤     subscript   i     L   subscript  A  i       X^{\prime}=\cup_{i}L(A_{i})   and that, for each pair of indices i,j , the subring    A   i  j      subscript  A    i  j     A_{ij}   of R generated by     A  i   ‚à™   A  j        subscript  A  i    subscript  A  j     A_{i}\cup A_{j}   is an    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   -algebra of finite type.  If    M  ‚äÜ  N      M  N    M\subseteq N   in    X  ‚Ä≤     superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤    X^{\prime}   are such that the maximal ideal of M is contained in that of N , then M=N .   Originally, Chevalley also supposed that R was an extension of finite type of a field K and that the    A  i     subscript  A  i    A_{i}   's were algebras of finite type over a field too (this simplifies the second condition above).
