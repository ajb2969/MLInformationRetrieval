Ishimori equation

The Ishimori equation (IE) is a partial differential equation proposed by the Japanese mathematician . Its interest is as the first example of a nonlinear spin-one field model in the plane that is integrable .
Equation
The Ishimori Equation has the form

Reductions
IE admits an important reduction: in 1+1 dimensions it reduces to the continuous classical Heisenberg ferromagnet equation (CCHFE). The CCHFE is integrable.
Equivalent counterpart
The equivalent counterpart of the IE is the Davey-Stewartson equation.
