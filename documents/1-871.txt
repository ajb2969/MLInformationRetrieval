Field of fractions


"Quotient field" redirects here. It should not be confused with a quotient ring.


In abstract algebra, the field of fractions of an integral domain is the smallest field in which it can be embedded. The elements of the field of fractions of the integral domain 
 
 
 
  are equivalence classes (see the construction below) written as 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The field of fractions of 
 
 
 
  is sometimes denoted by 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
Mathematicians refer to this construction as the field of fractions, fraction field, field of quotients, or quotient field. All four are in common usage. The expression "quotient field" may sometimes run the risk of confusion with the quotient of a ring by an ideal, which is a quite different concept.
Examples

The field of fractions of the ring of integers is the field of rationals, 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the ring of Gaussian integers. Then 
 
 
 
 , the field of Gaussian rationals.
The field of fractions of a field is canonically isomorphic to the field itself.
Given a field 
 
 
 
 , the field of fractions of the polynomial ring in one indeterminate 
 
 
 
  (which is an integral domain), is called the  or field of rational fractions123 and is denoted 
 
 
 
 .

Construction
Let 
 
 
 
  be any integral domain. For 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , the fraction 
 
 
 
  denotes the equivalence class of pairs 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to 
 
 
if and only if

 
 . (The definition of equivalence is modelled on the property of rational numbers that 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 .) The field of fractions

 
  is defined as the set of all such fractions 
 
 
 
 . The sum of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is defined as 
 
 
 
 , and the product of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is defined as 
 
 
 
  (one checks that these are well defined).
The embedding of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  maps each 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  to the fraction 
 
 
 
  for any nonzero 
 
 
 
  (the equivalence class is independent of the choice 
 
 
 
 ). This is modelled on the identity 
 
 
 
 . If additionally, 
 
 
 
  contains a multiplicative identity (that is, 
 
 
 
  is an integral domain), then 
 
 
 
 .
The field of fractions of 
 
 
 
  is characterised by the following universal property: if 
 
 
 
  is an injective ring homomorphism from 
 
 
 
  into a field 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a unique ring homomorphism 
 
 
 
  which extends 
 
 
 
 .
There is a categorical interpretation of this construction. Let 
 
 
 
  be the category of integral domains and injective ring maps. The functor from 
 
 
 
  to the category of fields which takes every integral domain to its fraction field and every homomorphism to the induced map on fields (which exists by the universal property) is the left adjoint of the forgetful functor from the category of fields to 
 
 
 
 .
A multiplicative identity is not required for the role of the integral domain; this construction can be applied to any nonzero commutative rng with no nonzero zero divisors.4
Generalisation
For any commutative ring 
 
 
 
  and any multiplicative set

 
  in 
 
 
 
 , the localization





 
  is the commutative ring consisting of fractions 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where now 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to 
 
 
 
  if and only if there exists 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Two special cases of this are notable:

If 
 
 
 
  is the complement of a prime ideal 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 




 
  is also denoted 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
  is an integral domain and 
 
 
 
  is the zero ideal, 
 
 
 
  is the field of fractions of 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is the set of non-zero-divisors in 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 




 
  is called the total quotient ring. The total quotient ring of an integral domain is its field of fractions, but the total quotient ring is defined for any commutative ring.
