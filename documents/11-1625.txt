   Thiamine-phosphate kinase      Thiamine-phosphate kinase   In enzymology , a thiamine-phosphate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + thiamine phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + thiamine diphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and thiamine phosphate , whereas its two products are ADP and thiamine diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:thiamine-phosphate phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include thiamin-monophosphate kinase , thiamin monophosphatase , and thiamin monophosphokinase . This enzyme participates in thiamine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
