   Tangent measure      Tangent measure   In measure theory , tangent measures are used to study the local behavior of Radon measures , in much the same way as tangent spaces are used to study the local behavior of differentiable manifolds . Tangent measures (introduced by David Preiss 1 in his study of rectifiable sets ) are a useful tool in geometric measure theory. For example, they are used in proving Marstrand’s theorem and Preiss' theorem .  Definition  Consider a Radon measure μ defined on an open subset Ω of n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n and let a be an arbitrary point in Ω. We can “zoom in” on a small open ball of radius r around a , B r ( a ), via the transformation         T   a  ,  r     (  x  )    =    x  -  a   r    ,         subscript  T   a  r    x       x  a   r     T_{a,r}(x)=\frac{x-a}{r},   which enlarges the ball of radius r about a to a ball of radius 1 centered at 0. With this, we may now zoom in on how μ behaves on B r ( a ) by looking at the push-forward measure defined by        T   a  ,   r  #     μ   (  A  )    =   μ   (   a  +   r  A    )           subscript  T   a    r  normal-#     μ  A     μ    a    r  A       T_{a,r\#}\mu(A)=\mu(a+rA)   where        a  +   r  A    =   {   a  +   r  x    :   x  ∈  A   }    .        a    r  A     conditional-set    a    r  x      x  A      a+rA=\{a+rx:x\in A\}.   As r gets smaller, this transformation on the measure μ spreads out and enlarges the portion of μ supported around the point a . We can get information about our measure around a by looking at what these measures tend to look like in the limit as r approaches zero.   Definition. A tangent measure of a Radon measure μ at the point a is a second Radon measure ν such that there exist sequences of positive numbers c i > 0 and decreasing radii r i → 0 such that           lim   i  →  ∞      c  i    T   a  ,    r  i   #     μ    =  ν        subscript    normal-→  i        subscript  c  i    subscript  T   a     subscript  r  i   normal-#     μ    ν    \lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}c_{i}T_{a,r_{i}\#}\mu=\nu         where the limit is taken in the weak-∗ topology , i.e., for any continuous function  φ with compact support in Ω,            lim   i  →  ∞      ∫  Ω     φ   d   (    c  i    T   a  ,    r  i   #     μ   )      =    ∫  Ω     φ   d  ν     .        subscript    normal-→  i       subscript   normal-Ω     φ  normal-d     subscript  c  i    subscript  T   a     subscript  r  i   normal-#     μ        subscript   normal-Ω     φ  normal-d  ν      \lim_{i\rightarrow\infty}\int_{\Omega}\varphi\,\mathrm{d}(c_{i}T_{a,r_{i}\#}%
 \mu)=\int_{\Omega}\varphi\,\mathrm{d}\nu.         We denote the set of tangent measures of μ at a by Tan( μ , a ).   Existence  The set Tan( μ , a ) of tangent measures of a measure μ at a point a in the support of μ is nonempty on mild conditions on μ . By the weak compactness of Radon measures, Tan( μ , a ) is nonempty if one of the following conditions hold:   μ is asymptotically doubling at a , i.e.      lim sup   r  ↓  0      μ   (   B   (  a  ,   2  r   )    )     μ   (   B   (  a  ,  r  )    )      <  ∞        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-↓  r  0        μ    B   a    2  r        μ    B   a  r          \limsup_{r\downarrow 0}\frac{\mu(B(a,2r))}{\mu(B(a,r))}<\infty       μ has positive and finite upper density , i.e.    0  <    lim sup   r  ↓  0      μ   (   B   (  a  ,  r  )    )     r  s     <  ∞        0    subscript  limit-supremum   normal-↓  r  0        μ    B   a  r      superscript  r  s              0<\limsup_{r\downarrow 0}\frac{\mu(B(a,r))}{r^{s}}<\infty   for some 0 .   Properties  The collection of tangent measures at a point is closed under two types of scaling. Cones of measures were also defined by Preiss.   The set Tan( μ , a ) of tangent measures of a measure μ at a point a in the support of μ is a cone of measures, i.e. if    ν  ∈   Tan   (  μ  ,  a  )        ν    Tan   μ  a      \nu\in\mathrm{Tan}(\mu,a)   and    c  >  0      c  0    c>0   , then     c  ν   ∈   Tan   (  μ  ,  a  )          c  ν     Tan   μ  a      c\nu\in\mathrm{Tan}(\mu,a)   .    The cone Tan( μ , a ) of tangent measures of a measure μ at a point a in the support of μ is a d-cone or dilation invariant , i.e. if    ν  ∈   Tan   (  μ  ,  a  )        ν    Tan   μ  a      \nu\in\mathrm{Tan}(\mu,a)   and    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   , then      T   0  ,   r  #     ν   ∈   Tan   (  μ  ,  a  )           subscript  T   0    r  normal-#     ν     Tan   μ  a      T_{0,r\#}\nu\in\mathrm{Tan}(\mu,a)   .   At typical points in the support of a measure, the cone of tangent measures is also closed under translations.   At μ almost every a in the support of μ , the cone Tan( μ , a ) of tangent measures of μ at a is translation invariant , i.e. if    ν  ∈   Tan   (  μ  ,  a  )        ν    Tan   μ  a      \nu\in\mathrm{Tan}(\mu,a)   and x is in the support of ν , then      T   x  ,   1  #     ν   ∈   Tan   (  μ  ,  a  )           subscript  T   x    1  normal-#     ν     Tan   μ  a      T_{x,1\#}\nu\in\mathrm{Tan}(\mu,a)   .   Examples   Suppose we have a circle in R 2 with uniform measure on that circle. Then, for any point a in the circle, the set of tangent measures will just be positive constants times 1-dimensional Hausdorff measure supported on the line tangent to the circle at that point.  In 1995, Toby O'Neil produced an example of a Radon measure μ on R d such that, for μ-almost every point a ∈ R d , Tan( μ , a ) consists of all nonzero Radon measures. 2   Related concepts  There is an associated notion of the tangent space of a measure. A k -dimensional subspace P of R n is called the k -dimensional tangent space of μ at a ∈ Ω if — after appropriate rescaling — μ “looks like” k -dimensional Hausdorff measure  H k on P . More precisely:   Definition.  P is the k - dimensional tangent space of μ at a if there is a θ > 0 such that          μ   a  ,  r     →   r  →  0   *   θ   H  k     ⌊  P   ,      fragments   subscript  μ   a  r      normal-→  r  0     normal-→    θ   superscript  H  k    fragments   subscript  normal-⌊  P   normal-,     \mu_{a,r}\xrightarrow[r\to 0]{*}\theta H^{k}\lfloor_{P},         where μ a , r is the translated and rescaled measure given by            μ   a  ,  r     (  A  )    =    1   r   n  -  1     μ   (   a  +   r  A    )     .         subscript  μ   a  r    A       1   superscript  r    n  1     μ    a    r  A       \mu_{a,r}(A)=\frac{1}{r^{n-1}}\mu(a+rA).         The number θ is called the multiplicity of μ at a , and the tangent space of μ at a is denoted T a ( μ ).   Further study of tangent measures and tangent spaces leads to the notion of a varifold . 3  References    "  Category:Measures (measure theory)     ↩  ↩   ↩
