   N-connected      N-connected   In the mathematical branch of algebraic topology , specifically homotopy theory , n -connectedness is a way to say that a space vanishes or that a map is an isomorphism "up to dimension n, in homotopy ".  n -connected space  A topological space  X is said to be n -connected when it is non-empty, path-connected , and its first n homotopy groups vanish identically, that is          π  i    (  X  )    ≡   0    ,   1  ≤  i  ≤  n    ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  π  i   X   0       1  i       n      \pi_{i}(X)\equiv 0~{},\quad 1\leq i\leq n,     where the left-hand side denotes the i -th homotopy group .  The requirements of being non-empty and path-connected can be interpreted as (−1)-connected and 0-connected , respectively, which is useful in defining 0-connected and 1-connected maps, as below. The 0- th homotopy set can be defined as:         π  0    (  X  ,  *  )    :=   [   (   S  0   ,  *  )   ,   (  X  ,  *  )   ]    .     assign     subscript  π  0    X        superscript  S  0      X       \pi_{0}(X,*):=[(S^{0},*),(X,*)].   This is only a pointed set , not a group, unless X is itself a topological group ; the distinguished point is the class of the trivial map, sending S 0 to the base point of X . Using this set, a space is 0-connected if and only if the 0th homotopy set is the one-point set. The definition of homotopy groups and this homotopy set require that X be pointed (have a chosen base point), which cannot be done if X is empty.  A topological space X is path-connected if and only if its 0-th homotopy group vanishes identically, as path-connectedness implies that any two points x 1 and x 2 in X can be connected with a continuous path which starts in x 1 and ends in x 2 , which is equivalent to the assertion that every mapping from S 0 (a discrete set of two points) to X can be deformed continuously to a constant map. With this definition, we can define X to be n-connected if and only if          π  i    (  X  )    ≡  0   ,   0  ≤  i  ≤  n    .     formulae-sequence       subscript  π  i   X   0       0  i       n      \pi_{i}(X)\equiv 0,\quad 0\leq i\leq n.     Examples   A space X is (−1)-connected if and only if it is non-empty.  A space X is 0-connected if and only if it is non-empty and path-connected .  A space is 1-connected if and only if it is simply connected .  An n -sphere is (n-1)-connected.   n -connected map  The corresponding relative notion to the absolute notion of an n -connected space is an n -connected map , which is defined as a map whose homotopy fiber  Ff is an ( n − 1)-connected space. In terms of homotopy groups, it means that a map    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   is n -connected if and only if:         π  i    (  f  )    :    π  i    (  X  )    →  ∼    π  i    (  Y  )       normal-:     subscript  π  i   f      subscript  π  i   X   similar-to  normal-→    subscript  π  i   Y     \pi_{i}(f)\colon\pi_{i}(X)\overset{\sim}{\to}\pi_{i}(Y)   is an isomorphism for    i  <  n      i  n    i   , and        π  n    (  f  )    :     π  n    (  X  )    ↠    π  n    (  Y  )        normal-:     subscript  π  n   f    normal-↠     subscript  π  n   X      subscript  π  n   Y      \pi_{n}(f)\colon\pi_{n}(X)\twoheadrightarrow\pi_{n}(Y)   is a surjection.   The last condition is frequently confusing; it is because the vanishing of the ( n − 1)-st homotopy group of the homotopy fiber  Ff corresponds to a surjection on the n th homotopy groups, in the exact sequence:         π  n    (  X  )    →    π  n    (  f  )      π  n    (  Y  )    →    π   n  -  1     (   F  f   )     .     normal-→     subscript  π  n   X      subscript  π  n   f   normal-→    subscript  π  n   Y      subscript  π    n  1      F  f      \pi_{n}(X)\overset{\pi_{n}(f)}{\to}\pi_{n}(Y)\to\pi_{n-1}(Ff).   If the group on the right     π   n  -  1     (   F  f   )        subscript  π    n  1      F  f     \pi_{n-1}(Ff)   vanishes, then the map on the left is a surjection.  Low-dimensional examples:   A connected map (0-connected map) is one that is onto path components (0th homotopy group); this corresponds to the homotopy fiber being non-empty.  A simply connected map (1-connected map) is one that is an isomorphism on path components (0th homotopy group) and onto the fundamental group (1st homotopy group).   n -connectivity for spaces can in turn be defined in terms of n -connectivity of maps: a space X with basepoint x 0 is an n -connected space if and only if the inclusion of the basepoint     x  0   ↪  X     normal-↪   subscript  x  0   X    x_{0}\hookrightarrow X   is an n -connected map. The single point set is contractible, so all its homotopy groups vanish, and thus "isomorphism below n and onto at n " corresponds to the first n homotopy groups of X vanishing.  Interpretation  This is instructive for a subset: an n -connected inclusion    A  ↪  X     normal-↪  A  X    A\hookrightarrow X   is one such that, up to dimension n −1, homotopies in the larger space X can be homotoped into homotopies in the subset A .  For example, for an inclusion map    A  ↪  X     normal-↪  A  X    A\hookrightarrow X   to be 1-connected, it must be:   onto      π  0    (  X  )    ,       subscript  π  0   X    \pi_{0}(X),     one-to-one on       π  0    (  A  )    →    π  0    (  X  )     ,     normal-→     subscript  π  0   A      subscript  π  0   X     \pi_{0}(A)\to\pi_{0}(X),   and  onto      π  1    (  X  )    .       subscript  π  1   X    \pi_{1}(X).      One-to-one on      π  0    (  A  )    →    π  0    (  X  )       normal-→     subscript  π  0   A      subscript  π  0   X     \pi_{0}(A)\to\pi_{0}(X)   means that if there is a path connecting two points     a  ,  b   ∈  A       a  b   A    a,b\in A   by passing through X, there is a path in A connecting them, while onto     π  1    (  X  )        subscript  π  1   X    \pi_{1}(X)   means that in fact a path in X is homotopic to a path in A.  In other words, a function which is an isomorphism on      π   n  -  1     (  A  )    →    π   n  -  1     (  X  )       normal-→     subscript  π    n  1    A      subscript  π    n  1    X     \pi_{n-1}(A)\to\pi_{n-1}(X)   only implies that any element of     π   n  -  1     (  A  )        subscript  π    n  1    A    \pi_{n-1}(A)   that are homotopic in X are abstractly homotopic in A – the homotopy in A may be unrelated to the homotopy in X – while being n -connected (so also onto     π  n    (  X  )        subscript  π  n   X    \pi_{n}(X)   ) means that (up to dimension n −1) homotopies in X can be pushed into homotopies in A .  This gives a more concrete explanation for the utility of the definition of n -connectedness: for example, a space such that the inclusion of the k -skeleton in n -connected (for n > k ) – such as the inclusion of a point in the n -sphere – means that any cells in dimension between k and n are not affecting the homotopy type from the point of view of low dimensions.  Applications  The concept of n -connectedness is used in the Hurewicz theorem which describes the relation between singular homology and the higher homotopy groups.  In geometric topology , cases when the inclusion of a geometrically-defined space, such as the space of immersions     M  →  N   ,     normal-→  M  N    M\to N,   into a more general topological space, such as the space of all continuous maps between two associated spaces      X   (  M  )    →   X   (  N  )     ,     normal-→    X  M     X  N     X(M)\to X(N),   are n -connected are said to satisfy a homotopy principle or "h-principle". There are a number of powerful general techniques for proving h-principles.
