Graded category

A graded category is a mathematical concept.
If 
 
 
 
  is a category, then a 

 
 -graded category is a category 
 
 
 
  together with a functor

 
 .
Monoids and groups can be thought of as categories with a single element. A monoid-graded or group-graded category is therefore one in which to each morphism is attached an element of a given monoid (resp. group), its grade. This must be compatible with composition, in the sense that compositions have the product grade.
Definition
There are various different definitions of a graded category, up to the most abstract one given above. A more concrete definition of a semigroup-graded Abelian category is as follows:1
Let 
 
 
 
  be an Abelian category and 
 
 
 
  a semigroup. Let 
 
 
 
  be a set of functors from 
 
 
 
  to itself. If



 
  is the identity functor on 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and


 
  is a full and faithful functor for every 
 
 


we say that 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -graded category.
