   Graded category      Graded category   A graded category is a mathematical concept.  If   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is a category , then a    𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   -graded category is a category   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   together with a functor     F  :   𝒞  →  𝒜      normal-:  F   normal-→  𝒞  𝒜     F:\mathcal{C}\rightarrow\mathcal{A}   .  Monoids and groups can be thought of as categories with a single element . A monoid-graded or group-graded category is therefore one in which to each morphism is attached an element of a given monoid (resp. group), its grade. This must be compatible with composition , in the sense that compositions have the product grade.  Definition  There are various different definitions of a graded category, up to the most abstract one given above. A more concrete definition of a semigroup-graded Abelian category is as follows: 1  Let   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   be an Abelian category and   𝔾   𝔾   \mathbb{G}   a semigroup . Let    𝒮  =   {   S  g   :   g  ∈  G   }       𝒮   conditional-set   subscript  S  g     g  G      \mathcal{S}=\{S_{g}:g\in G\}   be a set of functors from   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   to itself. If       S  1     subscript  S  1    S_{1}   is the identity functor on   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   ,        S  g    S  h    =   S   g  h           subscript  S  g    subscript  S  h     subscript  S    g  h      S_{g}S_{h}=S_{gh}   for all     g  ,  h   ∈  𝔾       g  h   𝔾    g,h\in\mathbb{G}   and      S  g     subscript  S  g    S_{g}   is a full and faithful functor for every    g  ∈  𝔾      g  𝔾    g\in\mathbb{G}      we say that    (  𝒞  ,  𝒮  )     𝒞  𝒮    (\mathcal{C},\mathcal{S})   is a   𝔾   𝔾   \mathbb{G}   -graded category.
