   Interpolation inequality      Interpolation inequality   In the field of mathematical analysis , an interpolation inequality is an inequality of the form          ∥   u  0   ∥   0   ≤   C    ∥   u  1   ∥   1   α  1      ∥   u  2   ∥   2   α  2    …    ∥   u  n   ∥   n   α  n      ,   n  ≥  2    ,     formulae-sequence     subscript   norm   subscript  u  0    0     C   superscript   subscript   norm   subscript  u  1    1    subscript  α  1     superscript   subscript   norm   subscript  u  2    2    subscript  α  2    normal-…   superscript   subscript   norm   subscript  u  n    n    subscript  α  n        n  2     \|u_{0}\|_{0}\leq C\|u_{1}\|_{1}^{\alpha_{1}}\|u_{2}\|_{2}^{\alpha_{2}}\dots\|%
 u_{n}\|_{n}^{\alpha_{n}},\quad n\geq 2,     valid for all u 0 , ..., u n in some (subsets of) vector spaces  X 0 , ..., X n equipped with norms ‖·‖ 0 , ‖·‖ 1 , ..., ‖·‖ n , and where C is a constant independent of u 0 , ..., u n and α 1 , ..., α n are some real powers. Usually, the elements u 0 , ..., u n are all the same element u and only the norms differ (as in Ladyzhenskaya's inequality below), but some interpolation inequalities use different u 0 , ..., u n (as in Young's inequality for convolutions below).  The main applications of interpolation inequalities lie in the theory of Sobolev spaces , where spaces of functions that have a non- integer number of derivatives are interpolated from the spaces of functions with integer number of derivatives. The abstract structure of interpolation inequalities is formalized in the notion of an interpolation space .  A simple example of an interpolation inequality — one in which all the u k are the same u , but the norms ‖·‖ k are different — is Ladyzhenskaya's inequality for functions u : ℝ 2 → ℝ, which states that whenever u is a compactly supported function such that both u and its gradient ∇ u are square integrable, it follows that the fourth power of u is integrable and         ∫   ℝ  2        |   u   (  x  )    |   4    d  x    ≤   2    ∫   ℝ  2        |   u   (  x  )    |   2    d  x    ∫   ℝ  2        |    ∇  u    (  x  )    |   2    d  x        ,        subscript    superscript  ℝ  2       superscript      u  x    4   normal-d  x      2    subscript    superscript  ℝ  2       superscript      u  x    2   normal-d  x    subscript    superscript  ℝ  2       superscript       normal-∇  u   x    2   normal-d  x         \int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}|u(x)|^{4}\,\mathrm{d}x\leq 2\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}|u(x)|^%
 {2}\,\mathrm{d}x\int_{\mathbb{R}^{2}}|\nabla u(x)|^{2}\,\mathrm{d}x,     i.e.         ∥  u  ∥    L  4    ≤     2  4       ∥  u  ∥    L  2    1  /  2       ∥   ∇  u   ∥    L  2    1  /  2      .       subscript   norm  u    superscript  L  4         4   2    superscript   subscript   norm  u    superscript  L  2      1  2     superscript   subscript   norm   normal-∇  u     superscript  L  2      1  2       \|u\|_{L^{4}}\leq\sqrt[4]{2}\,\|u\|_{L^{2}}^{1/2}\,\|\nabla u\|_{L^{2}}^{1/2}.     (Since Ladyzhenskaya's inequality considers compactly supported functions u , Friedrichs' inequality implies that the L 2 norm of ∇ u is equivalent to the H 1 Sobolev norm of u , and so Ladyzhenskaya's inequality really does only treat a single function u , not distinct functions u 0 = u 1 = u and u 2 = ∇ u .)  Another simple example of an interpolation inequality — one in which the u k and the norms ‖·‖ k are different — is Young's inequality for the convolution of two functions f , g : ℝ d → ℝ:         ∥   f  ⋆  g   ∥    L  s    ≤     ∥  f  ∥    L  r      ∥  g  ∥    L  p      ,       subscript   norm   normal-⋆  f  g     superscript  L  s       subscript   norm  f    superscript  L  r     subscript   norm  g    superscript  L  p       \|f\star g\|_{L^{s}}\leq\|f\|_{L^{r}}\|g\|_{L^{p}},     where the exponents p , r and s ≥ 1 are related by         1  r   +   1  p    =   1  +   1  s     .          1  r     1  p      1    1  s      \frac{1}{r}+\frac{1}{p}=1+\frac{1}{s}.
