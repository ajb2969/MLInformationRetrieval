   Partial equivalence relation      Partial equivalence relation   In mathematics , a partial equivalence relation (often abbreviated as PER , in older literature also called restricted equivalence relation )   R   R   R   on a set   X   X   X   is a relation that is symmetric and transitive . In other words, it holds for all     a  ,  b  ,  c   ∈  X       a  b  c   X    a,b,c\in X   that:   if    a  R  b      a  R  b    aRb   , then    b  R  a      b  R  a    bRa   (symmetry)  if    a  R  b      a  R  b    aRb   and    b  R  c      b  R  c    bRc   , then    a  R  c      a  R  c    aRc   (transitivity)   If   R   R   R   is also reflexive , then   R   R   R   is an equivalence relation .  Properties and applications  In a set-theoretic context, there is a simple structure to the general PER   R   R   R   on   X   X   X   : it is an equivalence relation on the subset    Y  =   {   x  ∈  X   |    x    R   x   }   ⊆  X        Y   conditional-set    x  X     x  R  x         X     Y=\{x\in X|x\,R\,x\}\subseteq X   . (   Y   Y   Y   is the subset of   X   X   X   such that in the complement of   Y   Y   Y   (    X  ∖  Y      X  Y    X\setminus Y   ) no element is related by   R   R   R   to any other.) By construction,   R   R   R   is reflexive on   Y   Y   Y   and therefore an equivalence relation on   Y   Y   Y   . Notice that   R   R   R   is actually only true on elements of   Y   Y   Y   : if    x  R  y      x  R  y    xRy   , then    y  R  x      y  R  x    yRx   by symmetry, so    x  R  x      x  R  x    xRx   and    y  R  y      y  R  y    yRy   by transitivity. Conversely, given a subset Y of X , any equivalence relation on Y is automatically a PER on X .  PERs are therefore used mainly in computer science , type theory and constructive mathematics , particularly to define setoids , sometimes called partial setoids. The action of forming one from a type and a PER is analogous to the operations of subset and quotient in classical set-theoretic mathematics.  Every partial equivalence relation is a difunctional relation , but the converse does not hold.  The algebraic notion of congruence can also be generalized to partial equivalences, yielding the notion of subcongruence , i.e. a homomorphic relation that is symmetric and transitive, but not necessarily reflexive. 1  Examples  A simple example of a PER that is not an equivalence relation is the empty relation    R  =  ∅      R     R=\emptyset   (unless    X  =  ∅      X     X=\emptyset   , in which case the empty relation is an equivalence relation (and is the only relation on   X   X   X   )).  Euclidean parallelism  In the Euclidean plane , two lines m and n are parallel lines when m ∩ n = ∅. The symmetry of this relation is obvious and the transitivity can be proven in the Euclidean plane, thus Euclidean parallelism is a partial equivalence relation. Nevertheless, mathematicians developing affine geometry prefer the facility of an equivalence relation and therefore sometimes revise the definition of parallelism to allow a line to be parallel to itself, making the new relation of "affine parallelism" that is a reflexive relation .  Kernels of partial functions  For another example of a PER, consider a set   A   A   A   and a partial function    f   f   f   that is defined on some elements of   A   A   A   but not all. Then the relation   ≈     \approx   defined by      x  ≈  y      x  y    x\approx y   if and only if   f   f   f   is defined at   x   x   x   ,   f   f   f   is defined at   y   y   y   , and     f   (  x  )    =   f   (  y  )          f  x     f  y     f(x)=f(y)   is a partial equivalence relation but not an equivalence relation. It possesses the symmetry and transitivity properties, but it is not reflexive since if    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is not defined then    x  ≉  x        x  x     x\not\approx x   — in fact, for such an   x   x   x   there is no    y  ∈  A      y  A    y\in A   such that    x  ≈  y      x  y    x\approx y   . (It follows immediately that the subset of   A   A   A   for which   ≈     \approx   is an equivalence relation is precisely the subset on which   f   f   f   is defined.)  Functions respecting equivalence relations  Let X and Y be sets equipped with equivalence relations (or PERs)     ≈  X   ,   ≈  Y       subscript   X    subscript   Y     \approx_{X},\approx_{Y}   . For     f  ,  g   :   X  →  Y      normal-:   f  g    normal-→  X  Y     f,g:X\to Y   , define    f  ≈  g      f  g    f\approx g   to mean:        ∀     x  0     x  1     ,   x  0     ≈  X    x  1   ⇒   f   (   x  0   )     ≈  Y    g   (   x  1   )          subscript   X     for-all     subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1      subscript  x  0     subscript  x  1     normal-⇒      f   subscript  x  0       subscript   Y       g   subscript  x  1       \forall x_{0}\;x_{1},\quad x_{0}\approx_{X}x_{1}\Rightarrow f(x_{0})\approx_{Y%
 }g(x_{1})     then    f  ≈  f      f  f    f\approx f   means that f induces a well-defined function of the quotients    X  /    ≈  X    →  Y  /   ≈  Y      fragments  X    subscript   X   normal-→  Y    subscript   Y     X/\approx_{X}\;\to\;Y/\approx_{Y}   . Thus, the PER   ≈     \approx   captures both the idea of definedness on the quotients and of two functions inducing the same function on the quotient.  References   Mitchell, John C.
