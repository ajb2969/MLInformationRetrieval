Damgård–Jurik cryptosystem
The '''Damgård–Jurik cryptosystem'''[[Ivan Damgård]], Mads Jurik: [http://www.brics.dk/RS/00/45/ A Generalisation, a Simplification and Some Applications of Paillier's Probabilistic Public-Key System]. Public Key Cryptography 2001: 119-136 is a generalization of the [[Paillier cryptosystem]]. It uses computation
 s modulo 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an RSA modulus and 
 
 
 
  a (positive) natural number. Paillier's scheme is the special case with 
 
 
 
 . The order 
 
 
 
  (Euler's totient function) of 
 
 
 
  can be divided by 
 
 
 
 . Moreover 
 
 
 
  can be written as the direct product of 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is cyclic and of order 
 
 
 
 , while 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 . For encryption, the message is transformed into the corresponding coset of the factor group

 
  and the security of the scheme relies on the difficulty of distinguishing random elements in different cosets of 
 
 
 
 . It is semantically secure if it is hard to decide if two given elements are in the same coset. Like Paillier, the security of Damgård–Jurik can be proven under the decisional composite residuosity assumption.
Key generation

Choose two large prime numbers p and q randomly and independently of each other.
Compute 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Choose an element 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for a known 
 
 
relative prime to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Using the Chinese Remainder Theorem, choose 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . For instance 
 
 
 
  could be 
 
 
 
  as in Paillier's original scheme.


The public (encryption) key is

The private (decryption) key is

Encryption

Let 
 
 
 
  be a message to be encrypted where 
 
 
 
 .
Select random 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 .
Compute ciphertext as
 
 
 
 .

Decryption

Ciphertext 
 
 

Compute 
 
 
 
 . If c is a valid ciphertext then 
 
 
 
 .
Apply a recursive version of the Paillier decryption mechanism to obtain 
 
 
 
 . As 
 
 
 
  is known, it is possible to compute 
 
 
 
 .

Simplification
At the cost of no longer containing the classical Paillier cryptosystem as an instance, Damgård–Jurik can be simplified in the following way:

The base g is fixed as 
 
 
 
 .
The decryption exponent d is computed such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

In this case decryption produces 
 
 
 
 . Using recursive Paillier decryption this gives us directly the plaintext m.
