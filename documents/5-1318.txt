   Jounce      Jounce   In physics , jounce or snap is the fourth derivative of the position vector with respect to time , with the first, second, and third derivatives being velocity , acceleration , and jerk , respectively; hence, the jounce is the rate of change of the jerk with respect to time. Jounce is defined by any of the following equivalent expressions:       s  →   =    d   j  →     d  t    =     d  2    a  →     d   t  2     =     d  3    v  →     d   t  3     =     d  4    r  →     d   t  4            normal-→  s       d   normal-→  j      d  t              superscript  d  2    normal-→  a      d   superscript  t  2               superscript  d  3    normal-→  v      d   superscript  t  3               superscript  d  4    normal-→  r      d   superscript  t  4        \vec{s}=\frac{d\vec{j}}{dt}=\frac{d^{2}\vec{a}}{dt^{2}}=\frac{d^{3}\vec{v}}{dt%

 \vec{j}_{0}\,t^{3}+\frac{1}{24}\vec{s}\,t^{4}     where      s  →     normal-→  s    \vec{s}   : constant jounce,       j  →   0     subscript   normal-→  j   0    \vec{j}_{0}   : initial jerk,      j  →     normal-→  j    \vec{j}   : final jerk,       a  →   0     subscript   normal-→  a   0    \vec{a}_{0}   : initial acceleration,      a  →     normal-→  a    \vec{a}   : final acceleration,       v  →   0     subscript   normal-→  v   0    \vec{v}_{0}   : initial velocity,      v  →     normal-→  v    \vec{v}   : final velocity,       r  →   0     subscript   normal-→  r   0    \vec{r}_{0}   : initial position,      r  →     normal-→  r    \vec{r}   : final position,     t   t   t   : time between initial and final states.  The notation    s  →     normal-→  s    \vec{s}   (used in 1 ) is not to be confused with the displacement vector commonly denoted similarly. Currently, there are no well-accepted designations for the derivatives of jounce. The fourth, fifth and sixth derivatives of position as a function of time are "sometimes somewhat facetiously" 2 3 referred to as Snap, Crackle and Pop respectively. Because higher-order derivatives are not commonly useful, there has been no consensus among physicists on the proper names for derivatives above jounce. 4 Despite this, physicists have proposed other names such as "Lock", "Drop", "Shot" and "Put" for higher-ordered derivatives.  The dimensions of jounce are distance per (time to the power of 4). In SI units , this is "metres per quartic second", "metres per second per second per second per second", m/s 4 , m · s −4 , or 100 Gal per second squared in CGS units. This pattern continues for higher order derivatives, with the 5th being m/s 5 .
