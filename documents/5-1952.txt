   Schiffler point      Schiffler point   (Figure)  Schiffler Point.svg   In geometry , the Schiffler point of a triangle is a point defined from the triangle that is invariant under Euclidean transformations of the triangle. This point was first defined and investigated by Schiffler et al. (1985).  A triangle ABC with the incenter  I has its Schiffler point at the point of concurrence of the Euler lines of the four triangles BCI , CAI , ABI , and ABC . Schiffler's theorem states that these lines are concurrent.  Trilinear coordinates for the Schiffler point are      [   1    cos  B   +   cos  C     ,   1    cos  C   +   cos  A     ,   1    cos  A   +   cos  B     ]       1      B     C       1      C     A       1      A     B       \left[\frac{1}{\cos B+\cos C},\frac{1}{\cos C+\cos A},\frac{1}{\cos A+\cos B}\right]   or, equivalently,      [     b  +  c   -  a    b  +  c    ,     c  +  a   -  b    c  +  a    ,     a  +  b   -  c    a  +  b    ]           b  c   a     b  c          c  a   b     c  a          a  b   c     a  b      \left[\frac{b+c-a}{b+c},\frac{c+a-b}{c+a},\frac{a+b-c}{a+b}\right]   where a , b , and c denote the side lengths of triangle ABC .
