   All-trans-retinyl-palmitate hydrolase      All-trans-retinyl-palmitate hydrolase   In enzymology , an all-trans-retinyl-palmitate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   all-trans-retinyl palmitate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   all-trans-retinol + palmitate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are all-trans-retinyl palmitate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are all-trans-retinol and palmitate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is all-trans-retinyl-palmitate acylhydrolase . This enzyme participates in retinol metabolism . This enzyme has at least one effector , Detergents .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
