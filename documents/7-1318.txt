   Milliken's tree theorem      Milliken's tree theorem   In mathematics , Milliken's tree theorem in combinatorics is a partition theorem generalizing Ramsey's theorem to infinite trees , objects with more structure than sets .  Let T be a finitely splitting rooted tree of height ω, n a positive integer, and    𝕊  T  n     subscript   superscript  𝕊  n   T    \mathbb{S}^{n}_{T}   the collection of all strongly embedded subtrees of T of height n. In one of its simple forms, Milliken's tree theorem states that if     𝕊  T  n   =    C  1   ∪  …  ∪   C  r         subscript   superscript  𝕊  n   T      subscript  C  1   normal-…   subscript  C  r      \mathbb{S}^{n}_{T}=C_{1}\cup...\cup C_{r}   then for some strongly embedded infinite subtree R of T,     𝕊  R  n   ⊂   C  i        subscript   superscript  𝕊  n   R    subscript  C  i     \mathbb{S}^{n}_{R}\subset C_{i}   for some i ≤ r.  This immediately implies Ramsey's theorem ; take the tree T to be a linear ordering on ω vertices.  Define     𝕊  n   =    ⋃  T    𝕊  T  n         superscript  𝕊  n     subscript   T    subscript   superscript  𝕊  n   T      \mathbb{S}^{n}=\bigcup_{T}\mathbb{S}^{n}_{T}   where T ranges over finitely splitting rooted trees of height ω. Milliken's tree theorem says that not only is    𝕊  n     superscript  𝕊  n    \mathbb{S}^{n}    partition regular for each n  \{ q \in P : q \geq p \}, and    I  S   (  p  ,  P  )       I  S   p  P     IS(p,P)   to be the set of immediate successors of p in P. Suppose S is an α-tree and T is a β-tree, with 0 ≤ α ≤ β ≤ ω. S is strongly embedded in T if:       S  ⊂  T      S  T    S\subset T   , and the partial order on S is induced from T,  if    s  ∈  S      s  S    s\in S   is nonmaximal in S and    t  ∈   I  S   (  s  ,  T  )        t    I  S   s  T      t\in IS(s,T)   , then     |    S  u  c  c   (  t  ,  T  )    ∩   I  S   (  s  ,  S  )     |   =  1            S  u  c  c   t  T      I  S   s  S      1    |Succ(t,T)\cap IS(s,S)|=1   ,  there exists a strictly increasing function from   α   α   \alpha   to   β   β   \beta   , such that      S   (  n  )    ⊂   T   (   f   (  n  )    )     .        S  n     T    f  n      S(n)\subset T(f(n)).      Intuitively, for S to be strongly embedded in T,   S must be a subset of T with the induced partial order  S must preserve the branching structure of T; i.e. , if a nonmaximal node in S has n immediate successors in T, then it has n immediate successors in S  S preserves the level structure of T; all nodes on a common level of S must be on a common level in T.
