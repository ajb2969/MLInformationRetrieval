Milliken's tree theorem

In mathematics, Milliken's tree theorem in combinatorics is a partition theorem generalizing Ramsey's theorem to infinite trees, objects with more structure than sets.
Let T be a finitely splitting rooted tree of height ω, n a positive integer, and 
 
 
 
  the collection of all strongly embedded subtrees of T of height n. In one of its simple forms, Milliken's tree theorem states that if 
 
 
 
  then for some strongly embedded infinite subtree R of T, 
 
 
 
  for some i ≤ r.
This immediately implies Ramsey's theorem; take the tree T to be a linear ordering on ω vertices.
Define 
 
 
 
  where T ranges over finitely splitting rooted trees of height ω. Milliken's tree theorem says that not only is 
 
 
partition regular for each n  \{ q \in P : q \geq p \}, and 
 
 
 
  to be the set of immediate successors of p in P. Suppose S is an α-tree and T is a β-tree, with 0 ≤ α ≤ β ≤ ω. S is strongly embedded in T if:



 
 , and the partial order on S is induced from T,
if 
 
 
 
  is nonmaximal in S and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 ,
there exists a strictly increasing function from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 


Intuitively, for S to be strongly embedded in T,

S must be a subset of T with the induced partial order
S must preserve the branching structure of T; i.e., if a nonmaximal node in S has n immediate successors in T, then it has n immediate successors in S
S preserves the level structure of T; all nodes on a common level of S must be on a common level in T.
