   Phenylglyoxylic acid      Phenylglyoxylic acid   Phenylglyoxylic acid is the organic compound with the formula C 6 H 5 C(O)CO 2 H. The conjugate base, known as benzoylformate is the substrate of benzoylformate decarboxylase , a thiamine diphosphate -dependent enzyme :   benzoylformate + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    benzaldehyde + CO 2    It is a colourless solid, m.p. 64–66 °C.  Phenylglyoxylic acid can be synthesized by oxidation of mandelic acid with potassium permanganate . 1 An alternative synthesis involves hydrolysis of benzoyl cyanide. 2  References    "  Category:Carboxylic acids     ↩  ↩
