Phenylglyoxylic acid

Phenylglyoxylic acid is the organic compound with the formula C6H5C(O)CO2H. The conjugate base, known as benzoylformate is the substrate of benzoylformate decarboxylase, a thiamine diphosphate-dependent enzyme:

benzoylformate + H+

benzaldehyde + CO2


It is a colourless solid, m.p. 64–66 °C.
Phenylglyoxylic acid can be synthesized by oxidation of mandelic acid with potassium permanganate.1 An alternative synthesis involves hydrolysis of benzoyl cyanide.2
