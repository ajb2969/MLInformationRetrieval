<h1>Closure operator</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>closure operator</strong> on a <a href="Set_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">set</a> <em>S</em> is a <a href="Function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\operatorname{cl}: \mathcal{P}(S)\rightarrow \mathcal{P}(S)$</span> from the <a href="power_set" title="wikilink">power set</a> of <em>S</em> to itself which satisfies the following conditions for all sets <span class="LaTeX">$X,Y\subseteq S$</span></p>

<p>Closure operators are determined by their <strong>closed sets</strong>, i.e., by the sets of the form cl(<em>X</em>), since the <strong>closure</strong> cl(<em>X</em>) of a set <em>X</em> is the smallest closed set containing <em>X</em>. Such families of "closed sets" are sometimes called "<strong>Moore families</strong>", in honor of <a href="E._H._Moore" title="wikilink">E. H. Moore</a> who studied closure operators in 1911.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Closure operators are also called "<strong>hull operators</strong>", which prevents confusion with the "closure operators" studied in <a href="point-set_topology" title="wikilink">topology</a>. A set together with a closure operator on it is sometimes called a <strong>closure system</strong>.</p>
<p>Closure operators have many applications:</p>
<p>In topology, the closure operators are <a href="Kuratowski_closure_axioms" title="wikilink"><em>topological</em> closure operators</a>, which must satisfy</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\operatorname{cl}(X_1 \cup\dots\cup X_n) = \operatorname{cl}(X_1)\cup\dots\cup \operatorname{cl}(X_n)$$</span></p>
<p>for all <span class="LaTeX">$n\in\N$</span> (Note that for <span class="LaTeX">$n=0$</span> this gives <span class="LaTeX">$\operatorname{cl}(\varnothing)=\varnothing$</span>).</p>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="algebra" title="wikilink">algebra</a> and <a class="uri" href="logic" title="wikilink">logic</a>, many closure operators are <strong>finitary closure operators</strong>, i.e. they satisfy</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\operatorname{cl}(X) = \bigcup\left\{\operatorname{cl}(Y) : Y\subseteq X \text{ and } Y \text{ finite} \right\}.$$</span></p>
<p>In <a href="universal_logic" title="wikilink">universal logic</a>, closure operators are also known as <strong>consequence operators</strong>.</p>
<p>In the theory of <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partially ordered sets</a>, which are important in <a href="theoretical_computer_science" title="wikilink">theoretical computer science</a>, closure operators have an alternative definition.</p>
<h2 id="closure-operators-in-topology">Closure operators in topology</h2>
<p>The <a href="topological_closure" title="wikilink">topological closure</a> of a subset <em>X</em> of a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> consists of all points <em>y</em> of the space, such that every <a href="neighbourhood_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">neighbourhood</a> of <em>y</em> contains a point of <em>X</em>. The function that associates to every subset <em>X</em> its closure is a topological closure operator. Conversely, every topological closure operator on a set gives rise to a topological space whose closed sets are exactly the closed sets with respect to the closure operator.</p>
<p>For topological closure operators the second closure axiom (being increasing) is redundant.</p>
<h2 id="closure-operators-in-algebra">Closure operators in algebra</h2>
<p>Finitary closure operators play a relatively prominent role in <a href="universal_algebra" title="wikilink">universal algebra</a>, and in this context they are traditionally called <em>algebraic closure operators</em>. Every subset of an <a href="structure_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">algebra</a> <em>generates</em> a <a href="substructure" title="wikilink">subalgebra</a>: the smallest subalgebra containing the set. This gives rise to a finitary closure operator.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best known example for this is the function that associates to every subset of a given <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> its <a href="linear_span" title="wikilink">linear span</a>. Similarly, the function that associates to every subset of a given <a href="group_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">group</a> the <a class="uri" href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroup</a> generated by it, and similarly for <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">fields</a> and all other types of <a href="algebraic_structure" title="wikilink">algebraic structures</a>.</p>
<p>The linear span in a vector space and the similar algebraic closure in a field both satisfy the <em>exchange property:</em> If <em>x</em> is in the closure of the union of <em>A</em> and {<em>y</em>} but not in the closure of <em>A</em>, then <em>y</em> is in the closure of the union of <em>A</em> and {<em>x</em>}. A finitary closure operator with this property is called a <a class="uri" href="matroid" title="wikilink">matroid</a>. The <a href="dimension_(vector_space)" title="wikilink">dimension</a> of a vector space, or the <a href="transcendence_degree" title="wikilink">transcendence degree</a> of a field (over its <a href="prime_field" title="wikilink">prime field</a>) is exactly the rank of the corresponding matroid.</p>
<p>The function that maps every subset of a given <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">field</a> to its <a href="algebraic_closure" title="wikilink">algebraic closure</a> is also a finitary closure operator, and in general it is different from the operator mentioned before. Finitary closure operators that generalize these two operators are studied in <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a> as dcl (for <em>definable closure</em>) and acl (for <em>algebraic closure</em>).</p>
<p>The <a href="convex_hull" title="wikilink">convex hull</a> in <em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a> is another example of a finitary closure operator. It satisfies the <em>anti-exchange property:</em> If <em>x</em> is not contained in the union of <em>A</em> and {<em>y</em>}, but in its closure, then <em>y</em> is not contained in the closure of the union of <em>A</em> and {<em>x</em>}. Finitary closure operators with this property give rise to <a href="antimatroid" title="wikilink">antimatroids</a>.</p>
<h2 id="closure-operators-in-logic">Closure operators in logic</h2>
<p>Suppose you have some <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">logical formalism</a> that contains certain rules allowing you to derive new formulas from given ones. Consider the set <em>F</em> of all possible formulas, and let <em>P</em> be the <a href="power_set" title="wikilink">power set</a> of <em>F</em>, ordered by ⊆. For a set <em>X</em> of formulas, let cl(<em>X</em>) be the set of all formulas that can be derived from <em>X</em>. Then cl is a closure operator on <em>P</em>. More precisely, we can obtain cl as follows. Call "continuous" an operator <em>J</em> such that, for every directed class <em>T</em>,</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>J</em>(<em>lim T</em>)= <em>lim J</em>(<em>T</em>).
</dd>
</dl>
<p>This continuity condition is on the basis of a fixed point theorem for <em>J</em>. Consider the one-step operator <em>J</em> of a monotone logic. This is the operator associating any set <em>X</em> of formulas with the set <em>J(X)</em> of formulas which are either logical axioms or are obtained by an inference rule from formulas in <em>X</em> or are in <em>X</em>. Then such an operator is continuous and we can define cl(<em>X</em>) as the least fixed point for <em>J</em> greater or equal to <em>X</em>. In accordance with such a point of view, Tarski, Brown, Suszko and other authors proposed a general approach to logic based on closure operator theory. Also, such an idea is proposed in programming logic (see Lloyd 1987) and in fuzzy logic (see Gerla 2000).</p>
<h3 id="consequence-operators">Consequence operators</h3>
<p>Around 1930, <a href="Alfred_Tarski" title="wikilink">Alfred Tarski</a> developed an abstract theory of logical deductions which models some properties of logical calculi. Mathematically, what he described is just a finitary closure operator on a set (the set of <em>sentences</em>). In <a href="universal_logic" title="wikilink">universal logic</a>, finitary closure operators are still studied under the name <em>consequence operator</em>, which was coined by Tarski. The set <em>S</em> represents a set of sentences, a subset <em>T</em> of <em>S</em> a theory, and cl(<em>T</em>) is the set of all sentences that follow from the theory. Nowadays the term can refer to closure operators which need not be finitary; finitary closure operators are then sometimes called <strong>finite consequence operators</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="closed-sets">Closed sets</h2>
<p>The closed sets with respect to a closure operator on <em>S</em> form a subset <em>C</em> of the power set <strong><em>P</em></strong>(<em>S</em>). Any intersection of sets in <em>C</em> is again in <em>C</em>. In other words, <em>C</em> is a complete meet-subsemilattice of <strong><em>P</em></strong>(<em>S</em>). Conversely, if <em>C</em> ⊆ <strong><em>P</em></strong>(<em>S</em>) is closed under arbitrary intersections, then the function that associates to every subset <em>X</em> of <em>S</em> the smallest set <em>Y</em> ∈ <em>C</em> such that <em>X</em> ⊆ <em>Y</em> is a closure operator.</p>
<p>A closure operator on a set is topological if and only if the set of closed sets is closed under finite unions, i.e., <em>C</em> is a meet-complete sublattice of <strong><em>P</em></strong>(<em>S</em>). Even for non-topological closure operators, <em>C</em> can be seen as having the structure of a lattice. (The join of two sets <em>X</em>,<em>Y</em> ⊆ <strong><em>P</em></strong>(<em>S</em>) being cl(<em>X</em> <span class="LaTeX">$\cup$</span> <em>Y</em>).) But then <em>C</em> is not a <a class="uri" href="sublattice" title="wikilink">sublattice</a> of the lattice <strong><em>P</em></strong>(<em>S</em>).</p>
<p>Given a finitary closure operator on a set, the closures of finite sets are exactly the <a href="compact_element" title="wikilink">compact elements</a> of the set <em>C</em> of closed sets. It follows that <em>C</em> is an <a href="algebraic_poset" title="wikilink">algebraic poset</a>. Since <em>C</em> is also a lattice, it is often referred to as an algebraic lattice in this context. Conversely, if <em>C</em> is an algebraic poset, then the closure operator is finitary.</p>
<h2 id="closure-operators-on-partially-ordered-sets">Closure operators on partially ordered sets</h2>
<p>A <a href="partially_ordered_set" title="wikilink">partially ordered set</a> (poset) is a set together with a <em>partial order</em> ≤, i.e. a binary relation which is reflexive (), transitive ( implies ) and antisymmetric ( implies <em>a</em> = <em>b</em>). Every <a href="power_set" title="wikilink">power set</a> <strong>P</strong>(<em>S</em>) together with inclusion ⊆ is a partially ordered set.</p>
<p>A function cl: <em>P</em> → <em>P</em> from a partial order <em>P</em> to itself is called a closure operator if it satisfies the following axioms for all elements <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in <em>P</em>.</p>
<dl>
<dd>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><em>x</em> ≤ cl(<em>x</em>)</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>(cl is <em>extensive</em>)</p></td>

<tr class="even">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p><em>x</em> ≤ <em>y</em> implies cl(<em>x</em>) ≤ cl(<em>y</em>)  </p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>(cl is <a class="uri" href="increasing" title="wikilink">increasing</a>)</p></td>

<tr class="odd">
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>cl(cl(<em>x</em>)) = cl(<em>x</em>)</p></td>
<td style="text-align: left;"><p>(cl is <a class="uri" href="idempotent" title="wikilink">idempotent</a>)</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>More succinct alternatives are available: the definition above is equivalent to the single axiom</p>
<dl>
<dd><em>x</em> ≤ cl(<em>y</em>) if and only if cl(<em>x</em>) ≤ cl(<em>y</em>)
</dd>
</dl>
<p>for all <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> in <em>P</em>.</p>
<p>Using the <a href="pointwise_order" title="wikilink">pointwise order</a> on functions between posets, one may alternatively write the extensiveness property as id<sub><em>P</em></sub> ≤ cl, where id is the <a href="identity_function" title="wikilink">identity function</a>. A self-map <em>k</em> that that is increasing and idempotent, but satisfies the <a href="Duality_(order_theory)" title="wikilink">dual</a> of the extensiveness property, i.e. <em>k</em> ≤ id<sub><em>P</em></sub> is called a <strong>kernel operator</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> <strong>interior operator</strong>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> or <strong>dual closure</strong>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As examples, if <em>A</em> is a subset of a set <em>B</em>, then the self-map on the powerset of <em>B</em> given by <em>μ<sub>A</sub></em>(<em>X</em>) = <em>A</em> ∪ <em>X</em> is a closure operator, whereas <em>λ<sub>A</sub></em>(<em>X</em>) = <em>A</em> ∩ <em>X</em> is a kernel operator. The <a href="ceiling_function" title="wikilink">ceiling function</a> from the <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real numbers</a> to the real numbers, which assigns to every real <em>x</em> the smallest <a class="uri" href="integer" title="wikilink">integer</a> not smaller than <em>x</em>, is another example of a closure operator.</p>
<p>A <a class="uri" href="fixpoint" title="wikilink">fixpoint</a> of the function cl, i.e. an element <em>c</em> of <em>P</em> that satisfies cl(<em>c</em>) = <em>c</em>, is called a <strong>closed element</strong>. A closure operator on a partially ordered set is determined by its closed elements. If <em>c</em> is a closed element, then <em>x</em> ≤ <em>c</em> and cl(<em>x</em>) ≤ <em>c</em> are equivalent conditions.</p>
<p>Every <a href="Galois_connection" title="wikilink">Galois connection</a> (or <a href="residuated_mapping" title="wikilink">residuated mapping</a>) gives rise to a closure operator (as is explained in that article). In fact, <em>every</em> closure operator arises in this way from a suitable Galois connection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> The Galois connection is not uniquely determined by the closure operator. One Galois connection that gives rise to the closure operator cl can be described as follows: if <em>A</em> is the set of closed elements with respect to cl, then cl: <em>P</em> → <em>A</em> is the lower adjoint of a Galois connection between <em>P</em> and <em>A</em>, with the upper adjoint being the embedding of <em>A</em> into <em>P</em>. Furthermore, every lower adjoint of an embedding of some subset into <em>P</em> is a closure operator. "Closure operators are lower adjoints of embeddings." Note however that not every embedding has a lower adjoint.</p>
<p>Any partially ordered set <em>P</em> can be viewed as a <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category</a>, with a single morphism from <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> if and only if <em>x</em> ≤ <em>y</em>. The closure operators on the partially ordered set <em>P</em> are then nothing but the <a href="monad_(category_theory)" title="wikilink">monads</a> on the category <em>P</em>. Equivalently, a closure operator can be viewed as an endofunctor on the category of partially ordered sets that has the additional <em>idempotent</em> and <em>extensive</em> properties.</p>
<p>If <em>P</em> is a <a href="complete_lattice" title="wikilink">complete lattice</a>, then a subset <em>A</em> of <em>P</em> is the set of closed elements for some closure operator on <em>P</em> if and only if <em>A</em> is a <strong>Moore family</strong> on <em>P</em>, i.e. the largest element of <em>P</em> is in <em>A</em>, and the <a class="uri" href="infimum" title="wikilink">infimum</a> (meet) of any non-empty subset of <em>A</em> is again in <em>A</em>. Any such set <em>A</em> is itself a complete lattice with the order inherited from <em>P</em> (but the <a class="uri" href="supremum" title="wikilink">supremum</a> (join) operation might differ from that of <em>P</em>). When <em>P</em> is the <a class="uri" href="powerset" title="wikilink">powerset</a> Boolean algebra of a set <em>X</em>, then a Moore family on <em>P</em> is called a <strong>closure system</strong> on <em>X</em>.</p>
<p>The closure operators on <em>P</em> form themselves a complete lattice; the order on closure operators is defined by cl<sub>1</sub> ≤ cl<sub>2</sub> <a class="uri" href="iff" title="wikilink">iff</a> cl<sub>1</sub>(<em>x</em>) ≤ cl<sub>2</sub>(<em>x</em>) for all <em>x</em> in <em>P</em>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>The concept of a closure is due to <a href="E._H._Moore" title="wikilink">E. H. Moore</a>, appearing in his 1910 <em>Introduction to a form of general analysis</em>, whereas that of a closure subset originated in the work of <a href="Frigyes_Riesz" title="wikilink">Frigyes Riesz</a> in connection with topological spaces.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
