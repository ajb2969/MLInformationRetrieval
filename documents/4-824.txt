   Exterior covariant derivative      Exterior covariant derivative   In mathematics , the exterior covariant derivative is an analog of an exterior derivative that takes into account the presence of a connection .  Definition  Let G be a Lie group and P → M be a principal G -bundle on a smooth manifold  M . Suppose there is a connection on P so that it gives a natural direct sum decomposition of each tangent space      T  u   P   =    H  u   ⊕   V  u           subscript  T  u   P    direct-sum   subscript  H  u    subscript  V  u      T_{u}P=H_{u}\oplus V_{u}   into the horizontal and vertical subspaces. Let    h  :     T  u   P   →   H  u       normal-:  h   normal-→     subscript  T  u   P    subscript  H  u      h:T_{u}P\to H_{u}   be the projection.  If ϕ is a k -form on P with values in a vector space V , then its exterior covariant derivative D ϕ is a form defined by       D  ϕ   (   v  0   ,   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  k   )    =   d  ϕ   (   h   v  0    ,   h   v  1    ,  …  ,   h   v  k    )          D  ϕ    subscript  v  0    subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  k       d  ϕ     h   subscript  v  0      h   subscript  v  1    normal-…    h   subscript  v  k        D\phi(v_{0},v_{1},\dots,v_{k})=d\phi(hv_{0},hv_{1},\dots,hv_{k})   where v i are tangent vectors to P at u .  Suppose V is a representation of G ; i.e., there is a Lie group homomorphism ρ: G → GL ( V ). If φ is equivariant in the sense:        R  g  *   ϕ   =   ρ    (  g  )    -  1    ϕ          superscript   subscript  R  g     ϕ     ρ   superscript  g    1    ϕ     R_{g}^{*}\phi=\rho(g)^{-1}\phi   where      R  g    (  u  )    =   u  g          subscript  R  g   u     u  g     R_{g}(u)=ug   , then D ϕ is a tensorial ( k + 1)-form on P of the type ρ: it is equivariant and horizontal (a form ψ is horizontal if ψ( v 0 , …, v k ) = ψ( hv 0 , …, hv k ).)   Example: if ω is the connection form on P , then Ω = D ω is called the curvature form of ω. Bianchi's second identity says the exterior covariant derivative of Ω is zero; i.e., D Ω = 0.   We also denote the differential of ρ at the identity element by ρ:       ρ  :   𝔤  →   𝔤  𝔩   (  V  )      .     normal-:  ρ   normal-→  𝔤    𝔤  𝔩  V      \rho:\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{gl}(V).   If φ is a tensorial k -form of type ρ, then        D  ϕ   =    d  ϕ   +    ρ   (  ω  )    ⋅  ϕ     ,        D  ϕ       d  ϕ    normal-⋅    ρ  ω   ϕ      D\phi=d\phi+\rho(\omega)\cdot\phi,    If k = 0, then, writing    X  #     superscript  X  normal-#    X^{\#}   for the fundamental vector field (i.e., vertical vector field) generated by X in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   on P , we have:       d  ϕ   (   X  u  #   )    =      d   d  t    |   0   ϕ   (   u   exp   (   t  X   )     )    =   -   ρ   (  X  )   ϕ   (  u  )     =   -   ρ   (   ω   (   X  u  #   )    )   ϕ   (  u  )             d  ϕ   subscript   superscript  X  normal-#   u       evaluated-at    d    d  t    0   ϕ    u   exp    t  X               ρ  X  ϕ  u             ρ    ω   subscript   superscript  X  normal-#   u    ϕ  u       d\phi(X^{\#}_{u})={d\over dt}|_{0}\phi(u\operatorname{exp}(tX))=-\rho(X)\phi(u%
 )=-\rho(\omega(X^{\#}_{u}))\phi(u)   , since φ( gu ) = ρ( g −1 )φ( u ). On the other hand, D φ( X # ) = 0. If X is a horizontal vector field, then     D  ϕ   (  X  )    =   d  ϕ   (  X  )          D  ϕ  X     d  ϕ  X     D\phi(X)=d\phi(X)   and     ω   (  X  )    =  0        ω  X   0    \omega(X)=0   . In general, by the invariant formula for exterior derivative, we have: for any vector fields X i 's, since φ takes the same values at hX i 's and X i 's,       D  ;    ϕ   (   X  0   ,  …  ,   X  k   )    -   d  ϕ   (   X  0   ,  …  ,   X  k   )      =     1   k  +  1        ∑  0  k       (   -  1   )   i   ρ   (   ω   (   X  i   )    )   ϕ   (   X  0   ,  …  ,    X  i   ^   ,  …  ,   X  k   )           D      ϕ    subscript  X  0   normal-…   subscript  X  k       d  ϕ    subscript  X  0   normal-…   subscript  X  k           1    k  1      superscript   subscript   0   k      superscript    1   i   ρ    ω   subscript  X  i    ϕ    subscript  X  0   normal-…   normal-^   subscript  X  i    normal-…   subscript  X  k         \displaystyle D;\phi(X_{0},\dots,X_{k})-d\phi(X_{0},\dots,X_{k})={1\over k+1}%
 \sum_{0}^{k}(-1)^{i}\rho(\omega(X_{i}))\phi(X_{0},\dots,\widehat{X_{i}},\dots,%
 X_{k})   where the hat means the term is omitted. This equals     (    ρ   (  ω  )    ⋅  ϕ   )    (   X  0   ,  ⋯  ,   X  k   )        normal-⋅    ρ  ω   ϕ     subscript  X  0   normal-⋯   subscript  X  k      (\rho(\omega)\cdot\phi)(X_{0},\cdots,X_{k})   . where    ρ   (  ω  )       ρ  ω    \rho(\omega)   is a     𝔤  𝔩   (  V  )       𝔤  𝔩  V    \mathfrak{gl}(V)   -valued form , and         (    ρ   (  ω  )    ⋅  ϕ   )    (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v   k  +  1    )    =    1  /    (   k  +  1   )   !      ∑  σ      sgn   (  σ  )    ρ    (   ω   (   v   σ   (  1  )     )    )   ϕ   (   v   σ   (  2  )     ,  …  ,   v   σ   (   k  +  1   )     )       .         normal-⋅    ρ  ω   ϕ     subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v    k  1          1      k  1       subscript   σ       sgn  σ   ρ     ω   subscript  v    σ  1     ϕ    subscript  v    σ  2    normal-…   subscript  v    σ    k  1           (\rho(\omega)\cdot\phi)(v_{1},\dots,v_{k+1})=1/{(k+1)}!\sum_{\sigma}%
 \operatorname{sgn}(\sigma)\rho(\omega(v_{\sigma(1)}))\phi(v_{\sigma(2)},\dots,%
 v_{\sigma(k+1)}).      Example: Bianchi's second identity ( D Ω = 0) can be stated as      d  Ω   +    ad   (  ω  )    ⋅  Ω    =  0          d  normal-Ω    normal-⋅   ad  ω   normal-Ω    0    d\Omega+\operatorname{ad}(\omega)\cdot\Omega=0   .   Unlike the usual exterior derivative , which squares to 0 (that is d 2 = 0), we have:         D  2   ϕ   =   F  ⋅  ϕ    ,         superscript  D  2   ϕ    normal-⋅  F  ϕ     D^{2}\phi=F\cdot\phi,    Proof: We have:         D  2   ϕ   =     ρ   (   d  ω   )    ⋅  ϕ   +    ρ   (  ω  )    ⋅   (    ρ   (  ω  )    ⋅  ϕ   )     =     ρ   (   d  ω   )    ⋅  ϕ   +     1  2   ρ   (   [   ω  ∧  ω   ]   )    ⋅  ϕ     ,           superscript  D  2   ϕ      normal-⋅    ρ    d  ω    ϕ    normal-⋅    ρ  ω    normal-⋅    ρ  ω   ϕ             normal-⋅    ρ    d  ω    ϕ    normal-⋅      1  2   ρ   delimited-[]    ω  ω     ϕ       D^{2}\phi=\rho(d\omega)\cdot\phi+\rho(\omega)\cdot(\rho(\omega)\cdot\phi)=\rho%
 (d\omega)\cdot\phi+{1\over 2}\rho([\omega\wedge\omega])\cdot\phi,   (cf. the example at Lie algebra-valued differential form#Operations ), which is     ρ   (  Ω  )    ⋅  ϕ     normal-⋅    ρ  normal-Ω   ϕ    \rho(\Omega)\cdot\phi   by E. Cartan's structure equation . where F = ρ(Ω). In particular D 2 vanishes for a flat connection (i.e., Ω = 0).  If ρ: G → GL ( R n ), then one can write       ρ   (  Ω  )    =  F  =   ∑    F   i  j     e   j  i              ρ  normal-Ω   F            subscript   superscript  F  i   j    subscript   superscript  e  j   i        \rho(\Omega)=F=\sum{F^{i}}_{j}{e^{j}}_{i}   where    e   i  j      subscript   superscript  e  i   j    {e^{i}}_{j}   is the matrix with 1 at the ( i , j )-th entry and zero on the other entries. The matrix    F   i  j      subscript   superscript  F  i   j    {F^{i}}_{j}   whose entries are 2-forms on P is called the curvature matrix .  Exterior covariant derivative for vector bundles  When ρ: G → GL ( V ) is a representation, one can form the associated bundle E = P ⊗ ρ  V . Then the exterior covariant differentiation D given by a connection on P defines      ∇  :    Γ   (  M  ,  E  )    →   Γ   (  M  ,    T  M   ⊗  E   )        normal-:  normal-∇   normal-→    normal-Γ   M  E      normal-Γ   M   tensor-product    T  M   E        \nabla:\Gamma(M,E)\to\Gamma(M,TM\otimes E)   through the correspondence between E -valued forms and tensorial forms of type ρ (see tensorial forms on principal bundles .) Requiring ∇ to satisfy Leibniz's rule, ∇ also acts on any E -valued forms. This ∇ is called the exterior covariant differentiation on E . One also sets: for a section s of E ,        ∇  X   s   =    i  X    ∇  s          subscript  normal-∇  X   s      subscript  i  X    normal-∇  s      \nabla_{X}s=i_{X}\nabla s   where    i  X     subscript  i  X    i_{X}   is the contraction by X . Explicitly,        ∇  X   s   =    (   h  X   )   s         subscript  normal-∇  X   s       h  X   s     \nabla_{X}s=(hX)s   since      ∇  X    ϕ  ¯    =    D  ϕ   (  X  )    ¯   =    d  ϕ   (   h  X   )    ¯   =    (   h  X   )   s           subscript  normal-∇  X    normal-¯  ϕ     normal-¯    D  ϕ  X          normal-¯    d  ϕ    h  X              h  X   s      \nabla_{X}\overline{\phi}=\overline{D\phi(X)}=\overline{d\phi(hX)}=(hX)s   when    s  =   ϕ  ¯       s   normal-¯  ϕ     s=\overline{\phi}   .  Conversely, given a vector bundle E , one can take its frame bundle , which is a principal bundle, and so gets an exterior covariant differentiation on E (depending on a connection). Identifying tensorial forms and E -valued forms, there is, for example,       2  F   (  X  ,  Y  )   s   =    (    -   [   ∇  X   ,   ∇  Y   ]    +   ∇   [  X  ,  Y  ]     )   s         2  F   X  Y   s           subscript  normal-∇  X    subscript  normal-∇  Y      subscript  normal-∇   X  Y     s     2F(X,Y)s=(-[\nabla_{X},\nabla_{Y}]+\nabla_{[X,Y]})s   .
