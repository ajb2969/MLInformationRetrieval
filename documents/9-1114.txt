Triple product property

In abstract algebra, the triple product property is an identity satisfied in some groups.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a non-trivial group. Three nonempty subsets 
 
 
 
  are said to have the triple product property in 
 
 
 
  if for all elements 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  it is the case that



where 
 
 
 
  is the identity of 
 
 
 
 .
It plays a role in research of fast matrix multiplication algorithms.
