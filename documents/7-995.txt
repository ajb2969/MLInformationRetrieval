   Cheeger bound      Cheeger bound   In mathematics , the Cheeger bound is a bound of the second largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix of a finite-state, discrete-time, reversible stationary Markov chain . It can be seen as a special case of Cheeger inequalities in expander graphs .  Let   X   X   X   be a finite set and let    K   (  x  ,  y  )       K   x  y     K(x,y)   be the transition probability for a reversible Markov chain on   X   X   X   . Assume this chain has stationary distribution    π   π   \pi   .  Define       Q   (  x  ,  y  )    =   π   (  x  )   K   (  x  ,  y  )          Q   x  y      π  x  K   x  y      Q(x,y)=\pi(x)K(x,y)     and for     A  ,  B   ⊂  X       A  B   X    A,B\subset X   define        Q   (   A  ×  B   )    =    ∑    x  ∈  A   ,   y  ∈  B      Q   (  x  ,  y  )      .        Q    A  B      subscript    formulae-sequence    x  A     y  B       Q   x  y       Q(A\times B)=\sum_{x\in A,y\in B}Q(x,y).     Define the constant   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   as       Φ  =    min    S  ⊂  X   ,    π   (  S  )    ≤   1  2        Q   (   S  ×   S  c    )     π   (  S  )       .      normal-Φ    subscript    formulae-sequence    S  X       π  S     1  2          Q    S   superscript  S  c       π  S       \Phi=\min_{S\subset X,\pi(S)\leq\frac{1}{2}}\frac{Q(S\times S^{c})}{\pi(S)}.     The operator    K  ,    K   K,   acting on the space of functions from    |  X  |      X    |X|   to    |  X  |      X    |X|   , defined by        (   K  ϕ   )    (  x  )    =    ∑  y    K   (  x  ,  y  )   ϕ   (  y  )             K  ϕ   x     subscript   y     K   x  y   ϕ  y      (K\phi)(x)=\sum_{y}K(x,y)\phi(y)\,     has eigenvalues      λ  1   ≥   λ  2   ≥  ⋯  ≥   λ  n          subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2        normal-⋯        subscript  λ  n      \lambda_{1}\geq\lambda_{2}\geq\cdots\geq\lambda_{n}   . It is known that     λ  1   =  1       subscript  λ  1   1    \lambda_{1}=1   . The Cheeger bound is a bound on the second largest eigenvalue    λ  2     subscript  λ  2    \lambda_{2}   .  Theorem (Cheeger bound):        1  -   2  Φ    ≤   λ  2   ≤   1  -    Φ  2   2     .          1    2  normal-Φ     subscript  λ  2          1     superscript  normal-Φ  2   2       1-2\Phi\leq\lambda_{2}\leq 1-\frac{\Phi^{2}}{2}.
