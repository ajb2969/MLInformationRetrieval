Cheeger bound

In mathematics, the Cheeger bound is a bound of the second largest eigenvalue of the transition matrix of a finite-state, discrete-time, reversible stationary Markov chain. It can be seen as a special case of Cheeger inequalities in expander graphs.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite set and let 
 
 
 
  be the transition probability for a reversible Markov chain on
