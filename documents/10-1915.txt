   2-dehydropantoate aldolase      2-dehydropantoate aldolase   In enzymology , a 2-dehydropantoate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-dehydropantoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + formaldehyde   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-dehydropantoate , and two products , 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate and formaldehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydropantoate formaldehyde-lyase (3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate-forming) . Other names in common use include ketopantoaldolase , and 2-dehydropantoate formaldehyde-lyase .  References     "  Category:EC 4.1.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
