   Resistive skin time      Resistive skin time   The resistive skin time is a characteristic time of typical magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) phenomena.  Definition  The resistive skin time is defined as:     τ  R   =     μ  0    a  2    η        subscript  τ  R        subscript  μ  0    superscript  a  2    η     \tau_{R}=\frac{\mu_{0}a^{2}}{\eta}   where   η   η   \eta   is the resistivity ,   a   a   a   is a typical radius of the device and    μ  0     subscript  μ  0    \mu_{0}   is the magnetic permeability .
