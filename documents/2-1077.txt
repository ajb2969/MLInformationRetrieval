In mathematics, the n-th harmonic number is the sum of the reciprocals of the first n natural numbers:



This also equals n times the inverse of the harmonic mean of these natural numbers.
The numbers n such that the numerator of the fully reduced expression for 
 
 
 
  is prime are

Harmonic numbers were studied in antiquity and are important in various branches of number theory. They are sometimes loosely termed harmonic series, are closely related to the Riemann zeta function, and appear in the expressions of various special functions.
The associated harmonic series grows without limit, albeit very slowly, roughly approaching the natural logarithm function.1 In 1737, Leonhard Euler used the divergence of this series to provide a new proof of the infinity of prime numbers. His work was extended into the complex plane by Bernhard Riemann in 1859, leading directly to the celebrated Riemann hypothesis about the distribution of prime numbers.
When the value of a large quantity of items has a Zipf's law distribution, the total value of the n most-valuable items is the n-th harmonic number. This leads to a variety of surprising conclusions in the Long Tail and the theory of network value.
Bertrand's postulate entails that, except for the case n=1, the harmonic numbers are never integers.2
Identities involving harmonic numbers
By definition, the harmonic numbers satisfy the recurrence relation



They also satisfy the series identity



The harmonic numbers are connected to the Stirling numbers of the first kind:



The functions


 
  satisfy the property


 
  In particular


 
  is a primitive of the logarithmic function.
Identities involving π
There are several infinite summations involving harmonic numbers and powers of π:3












Calculation
An integral representation given by Euler4 is



The equality above is obvious by the simple algebraic identity



Using the simple integral transform x = 1−u, an elegant combinatorial expression for Hn is



The same representation can be produced by using the third Retkes identity by setting 
 
 
 
  and using the fact that 
 
 




 The nth harmonic number is about as large as the natural logarithm of n. The reason is that the sum is approximated by the integral



whose value is ln(n).
The values of the sequence Hn - ln(n) decrease monotonically towards the limit



where γ ≈ 0.5772156649 is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The corresponding asymptotic expansion as n → ∞ is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the Bernoulli numbers.
Special values for fractional arguments
There are the following special analytic values for fractional arguments between 0 and 1, given by the integral



More values may be generated from the recurrence relation



or from the reflection relation



For example:
























For positive integers p and q with p  H_{\frac{p}{q}} = \frac{q}{p} +2\sum_{k=1}^{\lfloor\frac{q-1}{2}\rfloor} \cos(\frac{2 \pi pk}{q})\ln({\sin (\frac{\pi k}{q})})-\frac{\pi}{2}\cot(\frac{\pi p}{q})-\ln(2q)
For every x > 0, integer or not, we have:


 
  Based on this, it can be shown that:


 
  where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant or, more generally, for every n we have:



Generating functions
A generating function for the harmonic numbers is



where ln(z) is the natural logarithm. An exponential generating function is



where Ein(z) is the entire exponential integral. Note that



where Γ(0, z) is the incomplete gamma function.
Applications
The harmonic numbers appear in several calculation formulas, such as the digamma function



This relation is also frequently used to define the extension of the harmonic numbers to non-integer n. The harmonic numbers are also frequently used to define γ, using the limit introduced in the previous section, although



converges more quickly.
In 2002, Jeffrey Lagarias proved5 that the Riemann hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that



is true for every integer n ≥ 1 with strict inequality if n > 1; here σ(n) denotes the sum of the divisors of n.
The eigenvalues of the nonlocal problem



are given by 
 
 
 
 , where by convention, 
 
 

Generalization
Generalized harmonic numbers
The generalized harmonic number of order n of m is given by



The limit as n tends to infinity exists if m > 1.
Other notations occasionally used include



The special case of m = 0 gives 
 
 

The special case of m = 1 is simply called a harmonic number and is frequently written without the superscript, as



Smallest natural number k such that kn does not divide the denominator of generalized harmonic number H(k, n) nor the denominator of alternating generalized harmonic number H'(k, n) are

77, 20, 94556602, 42, 444, 20, 104, 42, 76, 20, 77, 110, 3504, 20, 903, 42, 1107, 20, 104, 42, 77, 20, 2948, 110, 136, 20, 76, 42, 903, 20, 77, 42, 268, 20, 7004, 110, 1752, 20, 19203, 42, 77, 20, 104, 42, 76, 20, 370, 110, 1107, 20, ... 
 

In the limit of n → ∞, the generalized harmonic number converges to the Riemann zeta function



The related sum 
 
 
 
  occurs in the study of Bernoulli numbers; the harmonic numbers also appear in the study of Stirling numbers.
Some integrals of generalized harmonic are



and


 
  where A is the Apéry's constant, i.e. ζ(3).
and


 
    for 
 
 

Every generalized harmonic number of order m can be written as a function of harmonic of order m-1 using:


 
    for example
 
 

A generating function for the generalized harmonic numbers is



where 
 
 
 
  is the polylogarithm, and |z| p,q>0 integer, and 
 
 
 
  integer or not, we have from polygamma functions:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Riemann zeta function. The relevant recurrence relation is:


 
  Some special values are:


 
  where G is the Catalan's constant















Multiplication formulas
Using polygamma functions, we obtain






or, more generally,



For generalized harmonic numbers, we have






where 
 
 
 
  is the Riemann zeta function.
Generalization to the complex plane
Euler's integral formula for the harmonic numbers follows from the integral identity



which holds for general complex-valued s, for the suitably extended binomial coefficients. By choosing a = 0, this formula gives both an integral and a series representation for a function that interpolates the harmonic numbers and extends a definition to the complex plane. This integral relation is easily derived by manipulating the Newton series



which is just the Newton's generalized binomial theorem. The interpolating function is in fact the digamma function



where 
 
 
 
  is the digamma, and γ is the Euler-Mascheroni constant. The integration process may be repeated to obtain



Relation to the Riemann zeta function
Some derivatives of fractional harmonic numbers are given by:









And using Maclaurin series, we have for x H_x = \sum_{n=1}^{\infin}(-1)^{n+1}x^n\zeta(n+1)






For fractional arguments between 0 and 1, and for a > 1:









Hyperharmonic numbers
The next generalization was discussed by J. H. Conway and R. K. Guy in their 1995 book The Book of Numbers.6 Let



Then the nth hyperharmonic number of order r (r>0) is defined recursively as



In special,
