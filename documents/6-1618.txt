   Locality preserving hashing      Locality preserving hashing   In computer science , a locality preserving hashing is a hash function  f that maps a point or points in a multidimensional coordinate space to a scalar value, such that if we have three points A , B and C such that        |   A  -  B   |   <   |   B  -  C   |   ⇒   |    f   (  A  )    -   f   (  B  )     |   <   |    f   (  B  )    -   f   (  C  )     |    .            A  B        B  C      normal-⇒          f  A     f  B                f  B     f  C        |A-B|<|B-C|\Rightarrow|f(A)-f(B)|<|f(B)-f(C)|.\,     In other words, these are hash functions where the relative distance between the input values is preserved in the relative distance between of the output hash values; input values that are closer to each other will produce output hash values that are closer to each other.  This is in contrast to cryptographic hash functions and checksums , which are designed to have maximum output difference between adjacent inputs .  Locality preserving hashes are related to space-filling curves and locality sensitive hashing .  External links      "  Category:Hash functions
