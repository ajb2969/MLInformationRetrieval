   Zeeman energy      Zeeman energy   Zeeman energy , or the external field energy, is the potential energy of a magnetised body in an external magnetic field. It is named after the Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman , primarily known by the Zeeman effect . In SI units, it is given by       E   Z  e  e  m  a  n    =   -    μ  0      ∫  V      𝐌  ⋅    𝐇   E  x  t      d  V           subscript  E    Z  e  e  m  a  n         subscript  μ  0     subscript   V      normal-⋅  M   subscript  H    E  x  t     normal-d  V        E_{Zeeman}=-\mu_{0}\int_{V}\,\textbf{M}\cdot\textbf{H}_{Ext}\,\mathrm{d}V     where H Ext is the external field, M the local magnetisation, and the integral is done over the volume of the body. This is the statistical average (over a unit volume macroscopic sample) of a corresponding microscopic Hamiltonial (energy) for each individual magnetic moment  m , which is however experiencing a local induction B :      H  =   -   𝐦  ⋅  𝐁        H     normal-⋅  m  B      H=-\textbf{m}\cdot\textbf{B}     References   d'Aquino, M, Phd thesis, http://wpage.unina.it/mdaquino/PhD_thesis/main/node16.html  Hubert, A. and Schäfer, R.
