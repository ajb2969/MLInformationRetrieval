Dermatan 4-sulfotransferase

Dermatan 4-sulfotransferase (, dermatan-specific N-acetylgalactosamine 4-O-sulfotransferase, dermatan-4-sulfotransferase-1, dermatan-4-sulfotransferase 1, D4ST-1, dermatan N-acetylgalactosamine 4-O-sulfotransferase, CHST14 protein, CHST14) is an enzyme with system name 3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate:(dermatan)-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 4-sulfotransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3'-phospho-5'-adenylyl sulfate + [dermatan]-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + [dermatan]-4-O-sulfo-N-acetyl-D-galactosamine
 

The sulfation takes place at the 4-position of N-acetyl-D-galactosamine residues of dermatan.
