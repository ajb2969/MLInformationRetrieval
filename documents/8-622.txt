   Katětov–Tong insertion theorem      Katětov–Tong insertion theorem   The Katětov–Tong insertion theorem is a theorem of point-set topology proved independently by Miroslav Katětov 1 and Hing Tong 2 in the 1950s.  The theorem states the following:  Let   X   X   X   be a normal topological space and let     g  ,  h   :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:   g  h    normal-→  X  ℝ     g,h\colon X\to\mathbb{R}   be functions with g upper semicontinuous , h lower semicontinuous and    g  ≤  h      g  h    g\leq h   . There exists a continuous function    f  :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  ℝ     f\colon X\to\mathbb{R}   with     g  ≤  f  ≤  h   .        g  f       h     g\leq f\leq h.     This theorem has a number of applications and is the first of many classical insertion theorems. In particular it implies the Tietze extension theorem and consequently Urysohn's lemma , and so the conclusion of the theorem is equivalent to normality.
