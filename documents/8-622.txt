Katětov–Tong insertion theorem

The Katětov–Tong insertion theorem is a theorem of point-set topology proved independently by Miroslav Katětov1 and Hing Tong2 in the 1950s.
The theorem states the following:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a normal topological space and let 
 
 
 
  be functions with g upper semicontinuous, h lower semicontinuous and 
 
 
 
 . There exists a continuous function 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 

This theorem has a number of applications and is the first of many classical insertion theorems. In particular it implies the Tietze extension theorem and consequently Urysohn's lemma, and so the conclusion of the theorem is equivalent to normality.
