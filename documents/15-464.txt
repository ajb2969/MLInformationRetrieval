   Firoozbakht's conjecture      Firoozbakht's conjecture   In number theory , Firoozbakht’s conjecture (or the Firoozbakht conjecture 1 2 ) is a conjecture about the distribution of prime numbers . It is named after the Iranian mathematician Farideh Firoozbakht from the University of Isfahan who stated it first in 1982. 3  The conjecture states that     p  n   1  /  n       superscript   subscript  p  n     1  n     p_{n}^{1/n}\,   (where     p  n      subscript  p  n    p_{n}\,   is the n th prime) is a strictly decreasing function of n , i.e.,       p   n  +  1    1  /   (   n  +  1   )     <    p  n   1  /  n    for all  n   ≥  1.         superscript   subscript  p    n  1      1    n  1        superscript   subscript  p  n     1  n    for all  n        1.     p_{n+1}^{1/(n+1)}     Equivalently      p   n  +  1    <    p  n   1  +   1  n     for all  n   ≥  1   ,         subscript  p    n  1       superscript   subscript  p  n     1    1  n     for all  n        1     p_{n+1}   see , .  By using a table of maximal gaps , Farideh Firoozbakht verified her conjecture up to 4.444     ×    10  1   2       absent     superscript  10  1   2     \times 10^{1}2   . 4 Now with more extensive tables of maximal gaps, the conjecture has been verified for all primes below 4     ×    10  1   8       absent     superscript  10  1   8     \times 10^{1}8   . 5  If the conjecture is true, then the prime gap function     g  n   =    p   n  +  1    -   p  n         subscript  g  n      subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n      g_{n}=p_{n+1}-p_{n}   satisfies     g  n    <     (   log   p  n    )   2   -   log    p  n   for all  n     >   4.       subscript  g  n    expectation     superscript     subscript  p  n    2        subscript  p  n   for all  n      4.    g_{n}<(\log p_{n})^{2}-\log p_{n}\text{ for all }n>4.    6 This is one of the strongest upper bound ever conjectured for prime gaps, even somewhat stronger than Cramer-Shanks conjecture . 7 Moreover, Firoozbakht's conjecture implies Cramér's conjecture in a strong form and would be consistent with Daniel Shanks conjectured asymptotic equality of record gaps, a somewhat stronger statement than Cramér's conjecture, 8 but inconsistent with the heuristics of Granville and Pintz 9 10 11 which suggest that     g  n   >     2  -  ε    e  γ      (   log   p  n    )   2         subscript  g  n         2  ε    superscript  e  γ     superscript     subscript  p  n    2      g_{n}>\frac{2-\varepsilon}{e^{\gamma}}(\log p_{n})^{2}   infinitely often for any     ε  >  0   ,      ε  0    \varepsilon>0,   where   γ   γ   \gamma   denotes Euler's constant .  Two related conjectures (see  Commments) are        (    log   (   p   n  +  1    )     log   (   p  n   )     )   n   <  e       superscript       subscript  p    n  1        subscript  p  n     n   e    \left(\frac{\log(p_{n+1})}{\log(p_{n})}\right)^{n}   , which is weaker. And,        (    p   n  +  1     p  n    )   n   <   n  *   log   (  n  )          superscript     subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n    n     n    n      \left(\frac{p_{n+1}}{p_{n}}\right)^{n}   for all values with    n  >  5      n  5    n>5   , which is stronger.  Currently, Firoozbakht's conjecture is included on the List of prime conjectures involving primes numbers listed from highest to least importance. 12 This short list of prime conjectures also includes Riemann hypothesis , Goldbach's conjecture , and Twin prime conjecture among others.
