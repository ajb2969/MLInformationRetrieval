Arabinonate dehydratase




Arabinonate dehydratase

In enzymology, an arabinonate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-arabinonate 
 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabinonate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-arabinonate, and two products, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabinonate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-arabinonate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabinonate-forming). This enzyme is also called D-arabinonate hydro-lyase.
