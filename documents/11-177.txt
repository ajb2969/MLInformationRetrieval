   Arabinonate dehydratase      Arabinonate dehydratase   In enzymology , an arabinonate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-arabinonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabinonate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-arabinonate , and two products , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabinonate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-arabinonate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-arabinonate-forming) . This enzyme is also called D-arabinonate hydro-lyase .
