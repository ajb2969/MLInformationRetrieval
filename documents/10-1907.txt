   (1-hydroxycyclohexan-1-yl)acetyl-CoA lyase      (1-hydroxycyclohexan-1-yl)acetyl-CoA lyase   In enzymology , a (1-hydroxycyclohexan-1-yl)acetyl-CoA lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (1-hydroxycyclohexan-1-yl)acetyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetyl-CoA + cyclohexanone   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (1-hydroxycyclohexan-1-yl)acetyl-CoA , and two products , acetyl-CoA and cyclohexanone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1-hydroxycyclohexan-1-yl)acetyl-CoA cyclohexanone-lyase (acetyl-CoA-forming) . This enzyme is also called (1-hydroxycyclohexan-1-yl)acetyl-CoA cyclohexanone-lyase .  References     "  Category:EC 4.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
