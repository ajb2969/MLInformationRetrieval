   Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem      Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem   In algebraic number theory , the Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem is a local-global principle stating that‚Äîexcept in some precisely defined cases‚Äîan element x in a number field  K is an n th power in K if it is an n th power in the completion     K  ùî≠     subscript  K  ùî≠    K_{\mathfrak{p}}   for all but finitely many primes   ùî≠   ùî≠   \mathfrak{p}   of K . For example, a rational number is a square of a rational number if it is a square of a p -adic number for almost all primes p . The Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem is an example of a local-global principle .  It was introduced by , but there was a mistake in this original version that was found and corrected by . The theorem considered by Grunwald and Wang was more general than the one stated above as they discussed the existence of cyclic extensions with certain local properties, and the statement about n th powers is a consequence of this.  History  , a student of Hasse , gave an incorrect proof of the erroneous statement that an element in a number field is an n th power if it is an n th power locally almost everywhere.  gave another incorrect proof of this incorrect statement. However  discovered the following counter-example: 16 is a p -adic 8th power for all odd primes p , but is not a rational or 2-adic 8th power. In his doctoral thesis  written under Artin , Wang gave and proved the correct formulation of Grunwald's assertion, by describing the rare cases when it fails. This result is what is now known as the Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem. The history of Wang's counterexample is discussed in  Wang's counter-example  Grunwald's original claim that an element that is an n th power almost everywhere locally is an n th power globally can fail in two distinct ways: the element can be an n th power almost everywhere locally but not everywhere locally, or it can be an n th power everywhere locally but not globally.  An element that is an n th power almost everywhere locally but not everywhere locally  The element 16 in the rationals is an 8th power at all places except 2, but is not an 8th power in the 2-adic numbers.  It is clear that 16 is not a 2-adic 8th power, and hence not a rational 8th power, since the 2-adic valuation of 16 is 4 which is not divisible by 8.  Generally, 16 is an 8th power in a field K if and only if the polynomial     X  8   -  16       superscript  X  8   16    X^{8}-16   has a root in K . Write         X  8   -  16   =    (    X  4   -  4   )    (    X  4   +  4   )    =    (    X  2   -  2   )    (    X  2   +  2   )    (     X  2   -   2  X    +  2   )    (    X  2   +   2  X   +  2   )     .           superscript  X  8   16        superscript  X  4   4      superscript  X  4   4              superscript  X  2   2      superscript  X  2   2        superscript  X  2     2  X    2      superscript  X  2     2  X   2       X^{8}-16=(X^{4}-4)(X^{4}+4)=(X^{2}-2)(X^{2}+2)(X^{2}-2X+2)(X^{2}+2X+2).     Thus, 16 is an 8th power in K if and only if 2, ‚àí2 or ‚àí1 is a square in K . Let p be any odd prime. It follows from the multiplicativity of the Legendre symbol that 2, ‚àí2 or ‚àí1 is a square modulo p . Hence, by Hensel's lemma , 2, ‚àí2 or ‚àí1 is a square in    ‚Ñö  p     subscript  ‚Ñö  p    \mathbb{Q}_{p}   .  An element that is an n th power everywhere locally but not globally  16 is not an 8th power in    ‚Ñö   (   7   )       ‚Ñö    7     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})   although it is an 8th power locally everywhere (i.e. in     ‚Ñö  p    (   7   )        subscript  ‚Ñö  p     7     \mathbb{Q}_{p}(\sqrt{7})   for all p ). This follows from the above and the equality      ‚Ñö  2    (   7   )    =    ‚Ñö  2    (    -  1    )           subscript  ‚Ñö  2     7       subscript  ‚Ñö  2       1       \mathbb{Q}_{2}(\sqrt{7})=\mathbb{Q}_{2}(\sqrt{-1})   .  A consequence of Wang's counterexample  Wang's counterexample has the following interesting consequence showing that one cannot always find a cyclic Galois extension of a given degree of a number field in which finitely many given prime places split in a specified way:  There exists no cyclic degree 8 extension    K  /  ‚Ñö      K  ‚Ñö    K/\mathbb{Q}   in which the prime 2 is totally inert (i.e., such that     K  2   /   ‚Ñö  2        subscript  K  2    subscript  ‚Ñö  2     K_{2}/\mathbb{Q}_{2}   is unramified of degree 8).  Special fields  For any    s  ‚â•  2      s  2    s\geq 2   let        Œ∑  s   :=    exp   (    2  œÄ  i    2  s    )    +   exp   (   -    2  œÄ  i    2  s     )     =   2   cos   (    2  œÄ    2  s    )      .       assign   subscript  Œ∑  s           2  œÄ  i    superscript  2  s             2  œÄ  i    superscript  2  s              2        2  œÄ    superscript  2  s         \eta_{s}:=\exp\left(\frac{2\pi i}{2^{s}}\right)+\exp\left(-\frac{2\pi i}{2^{s}%
 }\right)=2\cos\left(\frac{2\pi}{2^{s}}\right).     Note that the    2  s     superscript  2  s    2^{s}   th cyclotomic field is        ‚Ñö   2  s    =   ‚Ñö   (  i  ,   Œ∑  s   )     .       subscript  ‚Ñö   superscript  2  s      ‚Ñö   i   subscript  Œ∑  s       \mathbb{Q}_{2^{s}}=\mathbb{Q}(i,\eta_{s}).     A field is called s-special if it contains    Œ∑  s     subscript  Œ∑  s    \eta_{s}   , but neither   i   i   i   ,    Œ∑   s  +  1      subscript  Œ∑    s  1     \eta_{s+1}   nor    i   Œ∑   s  +  1        i   subscript  Œ∑    s  1      i\eta_{s+1}   .  Statement of the theorem  Consider a number field K and a natural number n . Let S be a finite (possibly empty) set of primes of K and put        K   (  n  ,  S  )    :=   {   x  ‚àà  K   ‚à£   x  ‚àà     K  ùî≠  n     for    all   ùî≠   ‚àâ  S   }    .     assign    K   n  S     conditional-set    x  K       x     superscript   subscript  K  ùî≠   n   for  all  ùî≠        S       K(n,S):=\{x\in K\mid x\in K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{n}\mathrm{\ for\ all\ }\mathfrak{p%
 }\not\in S\}.     The Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem says that       K   (  n  ,  S  )    =   K  n         K   n  S     superscript  K  n     K(n,S)=K^{n}     unless we are in the special case which occurs when the following two conditions both hold:      K   K   K   is s -special with an   s   s   s   such that    2   s  +  1      superscript  2    s  1     2^{s+1}   divides n .     S   S   S   contains the special set     S  0     subscript  S  0    S_{0}   consisting of those (necessarily 2-adic) primes   ùî≠   ùî≠   \mathfrak{p}   such that    K  ùî≠     subscript  K  ùî≠    K_{\mathfrak{p}}   is s -special.   In the special case the failure of the Hasse principle is finite of order 2: the kernel of        K  √ó   /   K    √ó  n     ‚Üí    ‚àè   ùî≠  ‚àâ  S      K  ùî≠  √ó   /   K  ùî≠    √ó  n         normal-‚Üí     superscript  K     superscript  K    absent  n       subscript  product    ùî≠  S       superscript   subscript  K  ùî≠      superscript   subscript  K  ùî≠     absent  n        K^{\times}/K^{\times n}\to\prod_{\mathfrak{p}\not\in S}K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{%
 \times}/K_{\mathfrak{p}}^{\times n}     is Z /2 Z , generated by the element Œ∑.  Explanation of Wang's counter-example  The field of rational numbers    K  =  ‚Ñö      K  ‚Ñö    K=\mathbb{Q}   is 2-special since it contains     Œ∑  2   =  0       subscript  Œ∑  2   0    \eta_{2}=0   , but neither   i   i   i   ,     Œ∑  3   =   2        subscript  Œ∑  3     2     \eta_{3}=\sqrt{2}   nor     i   Œ∑  3    =    -  2          i   subscript  Œ∑  3        2      i\eta_{3}=\sqrt{-2}   . The special set is     S  0   =   {  2  }        subscript  S  0    2     S_{0}=\{2\}   . Thus, the special case in the Grunwald‚ÄìWang theorem occurs when n is divisible by 8, and S contains 2. This explains Wang's counter-example and shows that it is minimal. It is also seen that an element in   ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   is an n th power if it is a p -adic n th power for all p .  The field    K  =   ‚Ñö   (   7   )        K    ‚Ñö    7      K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{7})   is 2-special as well, but with     S  0   =  ‚àÖ       subscript  S  0      S_{0}=\emptyset   . This explains the other counter-example above. 1  See also   The Hasse norm theorem states that for cyclic extensions an element is a norm if it is a norm everywhere locally.
