TRNA1Val (adenine37-N6)-methyltransferase




TRNA1Val (adenine37-N6)-methyltransferase

TRNA1Val (adenine37-N6)-methyltransferase (, YfiC) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA1Val (adenine37-N6)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine37 in tRNA1Val 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N6-methyladenine37 in tRNA1Val
 

The enzyme specifically methylates adenine37 in tRNA1Val (anticodon cmo5UAC).
