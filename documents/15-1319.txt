   TRNA1Val (adenine37-N6)-methyltransferase      TRNA1Val (adenine37-N6)-methyltransferase   TRNA1Val (adenine 37 -N 6 )-methyltransferase (, YfiC ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA1Val (adenine 37 -N 6 )-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 37 in tRNA1Val   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 6 -methyladenine 37 in tRNA1Val   The enzyme specifically methylates adenine 37 in tRNA1Val ( anticodon cmo5UAC).
