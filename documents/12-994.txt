   Littlewood polynomial      Littlewood polynomial   In mathematics , a Littlewood polynomial is a polynomial all of whose coefficients are +1 or −1. Littlewood's problem asks how large the values of such a polynomial must be on the unit circle in the complex plane . The answer to this would yield information about the autocorrelation of binary sequences. They are named for J. E. Littlewood who studied them in the 1950s.  Definition  A polynomial       p   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     a  i     x  i            p  x     superscript   subscript     i  0    n      subscript  a  i    superscript  x  i       p(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{n}a_{i}x^{i}\,     is a Littlewood polynomial if all the     a  i   =   ±  1        subscript  a  i    plus-or-minus  1     a_{i}=\pm 1   . Littlewood's problem asks for constants c 1 and c 2 such that there are infinitely many Littlewood polynomials p n , of increasing degree n satisfying         c  1     n  +  1     ≤   |    p  n    (  z  )    |   ≤    c  2     n  +  1      .           subscript  c  1       n  1          subscript  p  n   z            subscript  c  2       n  1        c_{1}\sqrt{n+1}\leq|p_{n}(z)|\leq c_{2}\sqrt{n+1}.\,     for all   z   z   z   on the unit circle. The Rudin-Shapiro polynomials provide a sequence satisfying the upper bound with     c  2   =   2        subscript  c  2     2     c_{2}=\sqrt{2}   . No sequence is known (as of 2008) which satisfies the lower bound.  References      "  Category:Polynomials  Category:Conjectures
