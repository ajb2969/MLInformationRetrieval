D(-)-tartrate dehydratase




D(-)-tartrate dehydratase

In enzymology, a D(âˆ’)-tartrate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S,S)-tartrate 
 
 
 
  oxaloacetate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (S,S)-tartrate, and two products, oxaloacetate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S,S)-tartrate hydro-lyase (oxaloacetate-forming). Other names in common use include D-tartrate dehydratase, and (S,S)-tartrate hydro-lyase. It has 2 cofactors: iron, and Manganese.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
