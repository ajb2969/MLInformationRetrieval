Hydrophilic-lipophilic balance

 The hydrophilic-lipophilic balance of a surfactant is a measure of the degree to which it is hydrophilic or lipophilic, determined by calculating values for the different regions of the molecule, as described by Griffin in 19491 and 1954.2 Other methods have been suggested, notably in 1957 by Davies.3
Griffin's method
Griffin's method for non-ionic surfactants as described in 1954 works as follows:



where 
 
 
 
  is the molecular mass of the hydrophilic portion of the molecule, and M is the molecular mass of the whole molecule, giving a result on a scale of 0 to 20. An HLB value of 0 corresponds to a completely lipophilic/hydrophobic molecule, and a value of 20 corresponds to a completely hydrophilic/lipophobic molecule.
The HLB value can be used to predict the surfactant properties of a molecule:

< 10 : Lipid-soluble (water-insoluble)
> 10 : Water-soluble (lipid-insoluble)
1.5 to 3: anti-foaming agent4
3 to 6: W/O (water in oil) emulsifier
7 to 9: wetting and spreading agent5
13 to 15: detergent6
12 to 16: O/W (oil in water) emulsifier
15 to 18: solubiliser or hydrotrope7

Davies' method
In 1957, Davies suggested a method based on calculating a value based on the chemical groups of the molecule. The advantage of this method is that it takes into account the effect of stronger and weaker hydrophilic groups. The method works as follows:8


where:


 
 
  - Number of hydrophilic groups in the molecule


 
  - Value of the 
 
 
th hydrophilic groups (see tables)


 
  - Number of lipophilic groups in the molecule
