   Hall–Littlewood polynomials      Hall–Littlewood polynomials   In mathematics , the Hall–Littlewood polynomials are symmetric functions depending on a parameter t and a partition λ. They are Schur functions when t is 0 and monomial symmetric functions when t is 1 and are special cases of Macdonald polynomials . They were first defined indirectly by Philip Hall using the Hall algebra , and later defined directly by .  Definition  The Hall–Littlewood polynomial P is defined by        P  λ    (  x  ;  1  )    =    m  λ    (  x  )           subscript  P  λ    x  1       subscript  m  λ   x     P_{\lambda}(x;1)=m_{\lambda}(x)     Specializations  We have that      P  λ    (  x  ;  0  )    =    s  λ    (  x  )           subscript  P  λ    x  0       subscript  s  λ   x     P_{\lambda}(x;0)=s_{\lambda}(x)   ,      P  λ    (  x  ;   -  1   )    =    P  λ    (  x  )           subscript  P  λ    x    1        subscript  P  λ   x     P_{\lambda}(x;-1)=P_{\lambda}(x)   and      s  λ    (  x  )    =    ∑  μ     K   λ  μ     (  t  )    P  μ    (  x  ,  t  )            subscript  s  λ   x     subscript   μ      subscript  K    λ  μ    t   subscript  P  μ    x  t       s_{\lambda}(x)=\sum_{\mu}K_{\lambda\mu}(t)P_{\mu}(x,t)   where the latter is the Schur P polynomials.  Properties  Expanding the Schur polynomials in terms of the Hall–Littlewood polynomials, one has       K   λ  μ     (  t  )        subscript  K    λ  μ    t    K_{\lambda\mu}(t)   where    t  =  1      t  1    t=1   are the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials . Note that as      K   λ  μ     (  t  )    =    ∑   T  ∈   S  S  Y  T   (  λ  ,  μ  )       t   c  h  a  r  g  e   (  T  )             subscript  K    λ  μ    t     subscript     T    S  S  Y  T   λ  μ       superscript  t    c  h  a  r  g  e  T       K_{\lambda\mu}(t)=\sum_{T\in SSYT(\lambda,\mu)}t^{charge(T)}   , these reduce to the ordinary Kostka coefficients.  A combinatorial description for the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials were given by Lascoux and Schützenberger,  $$K_{\lambda\mu}(t) = \sum_{T \in SSYT(\lambda,\mu)} t^{charge(T)}$$ where charge is a certain combinatorial statistic on semistandard Young tableaux, and the sum is taken over all semi-standard Young tableaux with shape λ and type μ.
