Hall–Littlewood polynomials

In mathematics, the Hall–Littlewood polynomials are symmetric functions depending on a parameter t and a partition λ. They are Schur functions when t is 0 and monomial symmetric functions when t is 1 and are special cases of Macdonald polynomials. They were first defined indirectly by Philip Hall using the Hall algebra, and later defined directly by .
Definition
The Hall–Littlewood polynomial P is defined by



Specializations
We have that 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  where the latter is the Schur P polynomials.
Properties
Expanding the Schur polynomials in terms of the Hall–Littlewood polynomials, one has


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials. Note that as 
 
 
 
 , these reduce to the ordinary Kostka coefficients.
A combinatorial description for the Kostka-Foulkes polynomials were given by Lascoux and Schützenberger,
$$K_{\lambda\mu}(t) = \sum_{T \in SSYT(\lambda,\mu)} t^{charge(T)}$$ where charge is a certain combinatorial statistic on semistandard Young tableaux, and the sum is taken over all semi-standard Young tableaux with shape λ and type μ.
