Shintani zeta function

In mathematics, a Shintani zeta function or Shintani L-function is a generalization of the Riemann zeta function. They were first studied by . They include Hurwitz zeta functions, Barnes zeta functions, and Witten zeta functions as special cases.
Definition
The Shintani zeta function of (s1, ..., sk) is given by



where each Lj is an inhomogeneous linear function of (n1, ... ,nm). The special case when k = 1 is the Barnes zeta function.
