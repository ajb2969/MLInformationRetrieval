   Barrett–Crane model      Barrett–Crane model   The Barrett–Crane model is a model in quantum gravity which was defined using the Plebanski action . 1 2  The   B   B   B   field in the action is supposed to be a    s  o   (  3  ,  1  )       s  o   3  1     so(3,1)   -valued 2-form , i.e. taking values in the Lie algebra of a special orthogonal group . The term       B   i  j    ∧   B   k  l         superscript  B    i  j     superscript  B    k  l      B^{ij}\wedge B^{kl}     in the action has the same symmetries as it does to provide the Einstein–Hilbert action . But the form of      B   i  j      superscript  B    i  j     B^{ij}     is not unique and can be posed by the different forms:        ±   e  i    ∧   e  j        plus-or-minus   superscript  e  i     superscript  e  j     \pm e^{i}\wedge e^{j}          ±    ϵ   i  j  k  l     e  k     ∧   e  l        plus-or-minus     superscript  ϵ    i  j  k  l     subscript  e  k      subscript  e  l     \pm\epsilon^{ijkl}e_{k}\wedge e_{l}      where    e  i     superscript  e  i    e^{i}   is the tetrad and    ϵ   i  j  k  l      superscript  ϵ    i  j  k  l     \epsilon^{ijkl}   is the antisymmetric symbol of the    s  o   (  3  ,  1  )       s  o   3  1     so(3,1)   -valued 2-form fields.  The Plebanski action can be constrained to produce the BF model which is a theory of no local degrees of freedom . John W. Barrett and Louis Crane modeled the analogous constraint on the summation over spin foam .  The Barrett–Crane model on spin foam quantizes the Plebanski action , but its path integral amplitude corresponds to the degenerate   B   B   B   field and not the specific definition       B   i  j    =    e  i   ∧   e  j         superscript  B    i  j       superscript  e  i    superscript  e  j      B^{ij}=e^{i}\wedge e^{j}   ,  which formally satisfies the Einstein's field equation of general relativity . However, if analysed with the tools of loop quantum gravity the Barrett–Crane model gives an incorrect long-distance limit 1 , and so the model is not identical to loop quantum gravity.
