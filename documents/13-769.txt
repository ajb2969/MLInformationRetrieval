   Fermat quintic threefold      Fermat quintic threefold   In mathematics, a Fermat quintic threefold is a special quintic threefold , in other words a degree 5 dimension 3 hypersurface in 4-dimensional projective space, given by        V  5   +   W  5   +   X  5   +   Y  5   +   Z  5    =   0.          superscript  V  5    superscript  W  5    superscript  X  5    superscript  Y  5    superscript  Z  5    0.    V^{5}+W^{5}+X^{5}+Y^{5}+Z^{5}=0.\,     It is a Calabi–Yau manifold .  The Hodge diamond of a non-singular quintic 3-fold is  Rational curves  conjectured that the number of rational curves of a given degree on a generic quintic threefold is finite. The Fermat quintic threefold is not generic in this sense, and  showed that its lines are contained in 50 1-dimensional families of the form ( x : − ζx : ay : by : cy ) for ζ 5 = 1 and a 5 + b 5 + c 5 = 0. There 375 lines in more than 1 family, of the form ( x : − ζx : y : − ηy : 0) for 5th roots of 1 ζ and η .  References       "  Category:Threefolds  Category:Complex manifolds
