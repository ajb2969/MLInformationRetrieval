1-methyladenosine nucleosidase

In enzymology, a 1-methyladenosine nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-methyladenosine + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-methyladenine + D-ribose
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-methyladenosine and H2O, whereas its two products are 1-methyladenine and D-ribose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-methyladenosine ribohydrolase. This enzyme is also called 1-methyladenosine hydrolase.
