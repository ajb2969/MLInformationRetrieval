   DSRP      DSRP   DSRP is a theory and method of thinking, developed by educational theorist and cognitive scientist, Derek Cabrera based on his research at Cornell University . It is an acronym, standing for Distinctions, Systems, Relationships, and Perspectives. Cabrera's research posits that these four patterns underlie all cognition, that they are universal to the process of structuring information, and that people can improve their thinking skills by learning to use the four elements explicitly.  Cabrera distinguishes between the DSRP Theory and the DSRP Method. The theory is the mathematical formalism and philosophical underpinnings, while the method is the set of tools and techniques people use in real life settings (such as education).  History  DSRP was first described by Derek Cabrera in the book Remedial Genius . 1 In later writings, Cabrera describes D, S, R, and P as “patterns of thinking,” and expands upon the implications of these thinking skills. 2 3 Although the DSRP theory is a deep mathematical formalism of systems thinking and cognition , predicated on the philosophical underpinnings of constructivism and evolutionary epistemology , the DSRP method has gained widespread popularity and use in education and is a growing influence in educational reform as well as in management of learning organizations . Numerous books, refereed journal articles, an entire refereed journal edition dedicated to the theory, many popular articles, news coverage, and two TED Talks given by Derek Cabrera summarize the theory. 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12  DSRP Theory  DSRP consists of four interrelated structures (or patterns), each structure has two opposing elements. The structures and their elements are:   Making Distinctions – which consist of an identity and an other  Organizing Systems – which consist of part and whole  Recognizing Relationships – which consist of action and reaction  Taking Perspectives – which consist of point and view 13   There are several rules governing DSRP:   Each structure (D,S,R, or P) implies the existence of the other three structures  Each structure implies the existence of its two elements and vice versa  Each element implies its opposite (e.g. identity implies other) 14   These rules illustrate that DSRP is a modular , fractal , nonlinear , complex systems process. The four DSRP structures do not occur in the mind in a stepwise, linear process but in a highly interdependent, complex way.  DSRP theory states that these four structures are inherent in every piece of knowledge and are universal to all human thinking, and that any piece of information can be viewed using each of these structures to gain a deeper understanding of that information. The order in which the operations take place does not matter, as all four occur simultaneously. 15  In a 2008 paper in a journal edition dedicated to DSRP, DSRP is described as a universal model for systems thinking . 16 Numerous experts in the field of systems thinking contributed papers to the journal edition on the DSRP theory and its contributions. One response paper pointed out that the structures of DSRP have analogues in existing instantiations of systems theory: distinctions are analogous to the boundaries of boundary critique ; viable system model explores parts and wholes in ways analogous to the "S" of DSRP; system dynamics is an exploration of relationships; and soft systems methodology explores perspectives. 17 The DSRP theory, however, goes beyond merely providing analogs to existing systems thinking principles by providing an integration of these principles that serves as a universal organizer for systems thinking itself.  Example  Any piece of information can be viewed using each of these elements to gain a deeper understanding of that information. For example, consider the U.S. Democratic Party . By giving the party a name, Democratic, a distinction is drawn between it and all other entities. In this instance, the Democratic Party is the identity and everything else (including the U.S. Republican Party ) is the other . From the perspective of the Republican Party ("identity"), however, the Democratic Party is the other .  The Democratic Party is also a system —it is a whole entity, but it is made up of constituent parts —its membership, hierarchy, values, etc. When viewed from a different perspective, the Democratic Party is just a part of the whole universe of American political parties.  The Democratic Party is in relationship with innumerable other entities, for example, the news media, current events, the American electorate, etc., each of which mutually influence the Party—a relationship of cause and effect . The Party is also a relationship itself between other concepts, for example, between a voter and political affiliation.  The Democratic Party is also a perspective on the world-- a point in the political landscape from which to view issues.  Formula  The primary application of the DSRP theory is through its various methodological tools but the theory itself is a mathematical formalism that contributes to the fields of evolutionary epistemology and cognition . The formal theory states that DSRP are simple rules in a complex adaptive system that yields systems thinking       S   T  n   =   ⊕   i  n  f  o     ⊗   j  ≤  n      {  :   D  o  i   ∘   S  w  p   ∘   R  r  a   ∘   P  v  ρ   :  }   j      fragments  S   subscript  T  n       i  n  f  o   direct-sum      j  n   tensor-product    subscript   fragments  normal-{  normal-:   superscript   subscript  D  o   i     superscript   subscript  S  w   p     superscript   subscript  R  r   a     superscript   subscript  P  v   ρ   normal-:  normal-}   j     {ST}_{n}=\underset{info}{\oplus}\underset{j\leq n}{\otimes}{\left\{:{D}_{o}^{i%
 }\circ{S}_{w}^{p}\circ{R}_{r}^{a}\circ{P}_{v}^{\rho}:\right\}}_{j}      The equation explains that autonomous agents (information, ideas or things) following simple rules (D,S,R,P) with their elemental pairs (i-o, p-w, a-r, ρ-v) in nonlinear order (:) and with various co-implications of the rules (○), the collective dynamics of which over a time series j to n leads to the emergence of what we might refer to as systems thinking (ST).  The elements of each of the four patterns follow a simple underlying logic as do the interactions between patterns. This logic underlies the unique ability of DSRP to be characterized as multivalent, but contain within it bivalency.

Users take concepts and model them with physical objects or diagrams. These objects are then moved around and associated in different ways to represent some piece of information, or content, and its context in terms of distinctions, systems, relationships, or perspectives. Once a concept has been modeled and explored using at least one of the four elements of DSRP, the user goes back to see if the existing model is sufficient for his or her needs, and if not, chooses another element and explores the concept using that. This process is repeated until the user is satisfied with the model. 19  The DSRP Method has several parts, including mindset, root lists, guiding questions, tactile manipulatives, and DSRP diagrams.  Mind set  The DSRP "mindset" is the paradigmatic shift toward thinking about underlying structure of ideas rather than only the content of speech acts, curriculum, or information of any kind. The DSRP mindset means the person is explicating underlying structure.  Root lists  Root list are simply lists of various concepts, behaviors, and cognitive functions that are "rooted in" D,S,R, or P. These root lists show the research linkages between the four universal structures and existing structures which users may be more familiar with such as categorization, sorting, cause and effect, etc.  Guiding questions  Guiding questions provide users with something akin to the Socratic Method of questioning but using DSRP as the underlying logic. Users pose so-called "guiding questions," of which there are two for each structure of DSRP. The guiding questions are:  Tactile manipulatives and DSRP diagrams  Users are encouraged to model ideas with blocks or other physical objects, or to draw (diagram) ideas in terms of D, S, R, and P. This aspect of the method is promoted as a form of nonlinguistic representation of ideas, based on research showing that learners acquire and structure knowledge more effectively when information is presented in linguistic and nonlinguistic formats. 20  Educational outcomes  With continued use, the method is supposed to improve six specific types of thinking skills:   Critical thinking - this improves as people learn to examine the reasoning behind the distinctions they draw and the perspectives and relationships that influence how information is presented  Creative thinking - this improves as people make connections (i.e. relationships) between new pieces of information  Systems thinking - this improves as one becomes increasingly fluent with all four elements of DSRP  Interdisciplinary thinking - this improves as people reconsider boundaries (i.e. distinctions) and make connections between new pieces of information  Scientific thinking - this improves as people learn to analyze information in a logical way  Emotional intelligence / Prosocial thinking - this improves as people learn to take multiple perspectives—particularly to imagine the perspectives of other people 21   In addition, the DSRP Method is supposed to improve teacher effectiveness .  Applications  DSRP Theory, as a deep mathematical and epistemological formalism, and the DSRP Method, as a set of cognitive tools, is universally applicable to any field of knowledge. It has been applied to a variety of fields and may be applicable to many more.  Education  The DSRP method has been used extensively in educational settings from preschool through post-secondary settings. The DSRP method, as applied in education, is intended to work with existing subject-specific curricula to build thinking skills and provide a way for students to structure content knowledge. 22  Organizational learning  As a universal theory of systems thinking, DSRP method is in broad use as the basis for organizational learning. The link between organizational learning and systems thinking was made by Peter Senge . DSRP Methodologies provide tools for developing complex adaptive organizations that learn. DSRP forms the basis of an organizational systems and learning model called VMCL .  Physical, natural, and social sciences  Because DSRP is both an epistemological and an ontological theory 23 (that is, it is predictive not only of what is known but also how new things will come to be known and how those things are actually structured a priori), it could theoretically be used not only to deconstruct existing (known) knowledge about any phenomena but also can be used as a predictive and prescriptive tool to advance any area of knowledge about any physical, natural, or social phenomena. DSRP Theory posits that the mind-body problem and symbol grounding problem that causes a disconnect between our knowledge of physical things and the physical world (the basis of systems thinking) is resolved because our universal DSRP cognitive structures evolved within the boundaries and constraints of the physical, chemical, and biological laws. That is, ontological underlying structure of physical things as well as the epistemological underlying structure of ideas is reconciled under DSRP. A video 24 demonstration of a recent scientific advancement provides a good specific example of how DSRP applies to scientific discovery both descriptively and predictively.  Evaluation & program planning  DSRP has been used to apply systems thinking to the fields of evaluation and program planning, including an National Science Foundation -funded initiative to evaluate of large-scale science, technology, engineering, and math ( STEM ) education programs, as well as evaluations of the complexity science education programs of the Santa Fe Institute . 25 26  Public health  A 2006 article in the American Journal of Public Health applies DSRP systems thinking to the public health system. 27  See also   Critical thinking  Perspective (cognitive)  Systems theory  Systems thinking  Creative thinking  Interdisciplinary thinking  Scientific thinking  Emotional intelligence  Prosocial thinking  Higher order thinking  Critical systems thinking  Boundary critique   Polarity Thinking  References  External links   http://www.crlab.us   "  Category:Thought  Category:Systems theory     Cabrera, D.
