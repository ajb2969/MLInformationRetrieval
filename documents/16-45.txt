   Beta-phellandrene synthase (neryl-diphosphate-cyclizing)      Beta-phellandrene synthase (neryl-diphosphate-cyclizing)   Beta-phellandrene synthase (neryl-diphosphate-cyclizing) (, phellandrene synthase 1 , PHS1 , monoterpene synthase PHS1 ) is an enzyme with system name neryl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing; beta-phellandrene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   neryl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   beta-phellandrene + diphosphate    The enzyme from Solanum lycopersicum has very poor affinity with geranyl diphosphate.
