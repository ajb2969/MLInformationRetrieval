   Skorokhod's representation theorem      Skorokhod's representation theorem   In mathematics and statistics , Skorokhod's representation theorem is a result that shows that a weakly convergent  sequence of probability measures whose limit measure is sufficiently well-behaved can be represented as the distribution/law of a pointwise convergent sequence of random variables defined on a common probability space . It is named for the Ukrainian  mathematician  A.V. Skorokhod .  Statement of the theorem  Let μ n , n ∈ N be a sequence of probability measures on a metric space  S ; suppose that μ n converges weakly to some probability measure μ on S as n → ∞. Suppose also that the support of μ is separable . Then there exist random variables X n , X defined on a common probability space (Ω, F , P ) such that        x  n     →  𝑑     μ  n       d  normal-→    subscript  x  n    subscript  μ  n     x_{n}\xrightarrow{d}\ \mu_{n}   (i.e. μ n is the distribution/law of X n );      x    →  𝑑    μ      d  normal-→   x  μ    x\xrightarrow{d}\ \mu   (i.e. μ is the distribution/law of X ); and       x  n    →   a  .  s  .    x       fragments  a  normal-.  s  normal-.   normal-→    subscript  x  n   x    x_{n}\xrightarrow{\mathrm{a.s.}}x      See also   Convergence in distribution   References    (see p. 7 for weak convergence, p. 24 for convergence in distribution and p. 70 for Skorokhod's theorem)   "  Category:Probability theorems  Category:Statistical theorems
