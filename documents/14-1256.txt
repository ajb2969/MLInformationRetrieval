   Basic affine jump diffusion      Basic affine jump diffusion   In probability theory , a basic affine jump diffusion (basic AJD) is a stochastic process Z of the form         d   Z  t    =    κ   (   θ  -   Z  t    )   d  t   +   σ     Z  t     d   B  t    +   d   J  t      ,    t  ≥  0   ,    Z  0   ≥  0     ,     formulae-sequence      d   subscript  Z  t        κ    θ   subscript  Z  t    d  t     σ     subscript  Z  t    d   subscript  B  t      d   subscript  J  t       formulae-sequence    t  0      subscript  Z  0   0      dZ_{t}=\kappa(\theta-Z_{t})\,dt+\sigma\sqrt{Z_{t}}\,dB_{t}+dJ_{t},\qquad t\geq

 ,Z_{0}\geq 0,     where   B   B   B   is a standard Brownian motion , and   J   J   J   is an independent compound Poisson process with constant jump intensity   l   l   l   and independent exponentially distributed jumps with mean   μ   μ   \mu   . For the process to be well defined, it is necessary that     κ  θ   ≥  0        κ  θ   0    \kappa\theta\geq 0   and    μ  ≥  0      μ  0    \mu\geq 0   . A basic AJD is a special case of an affine process and of a jump diffusion . On the other hand, the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) process is a special case of a basic AJD.  Basic AJDs are attractive for modeling default times in credit risk applications, 1 2 3 4 since both the moment generating function         m   (  q  )    =   E   (   e   q     ∫  0  t       Z  s    d  s      )     ,   q  ∈  ℝ    ,     formulae-sequence      m  q    normal-E   superscript  e    q    superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  Z  s   d  s          q  ℝ     m\left(q\right)=\operatorname{E}\left(e^{q\int_{0}^{t}Z_{s}\,ds}\right),\qquad
