Basic affine jump diffusion

In probability theory, a basic affine jump diffusion (basic AJD) is a stochastic process Z of the form



where 
 
 
 
  is a standard Brownian motion, and 
 
 
 
  is an independent compound Poisson process with constant jump intensity 
 
 
 
  and independent exponentially distributed jumps with mean 
 
 
 
 . For the process to be well defined, it is necessary that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . A basic AJD is a special case of an affine process and of a jump diffusion. On the other hand, the Cox–Ingersoll–Ross (CIR) process is a special case of a basic AJD.
Basic AJDs are attractive for modeling default times in credit risk applications,1234 since both the moment generating function



and the characteristic function



are known in closed form.5
The characteristic function allows one to calculate the density of an integrated basic AJD



by Fourier inversion, which can be done efficiently using the FFT.
