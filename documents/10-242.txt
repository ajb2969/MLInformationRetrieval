   Dawson–Gärtner theorem      Dawson–Gärtner theorem   In mathematics , the Dawson–Gärtner theorem is a result in large deviations theory . Heuristically speaking, the Dawson–Gärtner theorem allows one to transport a large deviation principle on a “smaller” topological space to a “larger” one.  Statement of the theorem  Let ( Y j ) j ∈ J be a projective system of Hausdorff topological spaces with maps p ij : Y j → Y i . Let X be the projective limit (also known as the inverse limit) of the system ( Y j , p ij ) i , j ∈ J , i.e.       X  =     lim  ←    j  ∈  J     Y  j    =   {   y  =    (   y  j   )    j  ∈  J    ∈  Y  =    ∏   j  ∈  J     Y  j     |   i  <  j  ⟹   y  i   =    p   i  j     (   y  j   )     }    .

Assume that, for each j ∈ J , the push-forward measures ( p j ∗ μ ε ) ε >0 on Y j satisfy the large deviation principle with good rate function  I j : Y j → R ∪ {+∞}. Then the family ( μ ε ) ε >0 satisfies the large deviation principle on X with good rate function I : X → R ∪ {+∞} given by        I   (  x  )    =    sup   j  ∈  J      I  j    (    p  j    (  x  )    )      .
