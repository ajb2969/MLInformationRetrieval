It has about three times the Sun's mass.6 The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star is about 4.99 mas,7 which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 52 times the radius of the Sun.8 The effective temperature of the outer envelope is ,9 giving it an orange hue that is characteristic of a K-type star.10 Around 4 times as massive as the Sun, it spent much of its life as a main sequence star of spectral type B5V.11
