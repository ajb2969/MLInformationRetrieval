   Deformation retract      Deformation retract   In topology , a branch of mathematics, a retraction 1 is a continuous mapping from the entire space into a subspace which preserves the position of all points in that subspace. A deformation retraction is a map which captures the idea of continuously shrinking a space into a subspace.  Definitions  Retract  Let X be a topological space and A a subspace of X . Then a continuous map      r  :   X  →  A      normal-:  r   normal-→  X  A     r:X\to A     is a retraction if the restriction of r to A is the identity map on A ; that is, r ( a ) = a for all a in A . Equivalently, denoting by      ι  :   A  ↪  X      normal-:  ι   normal-↪  A  X     \iota:A\hookrightarrow X     the inclusion , a retraction is a continuous map r such that        r  ∘  ι   =   i   d  A     ,        r  ι     i   subscript  d  A      r\circ\iota=id_{A},     that is, the composition of r with the inclusion is the identity of A . Note that, by definition, a retraction maps X  onto  A . A subspace A is called a retract of X if such a retraction exists. For instance, any non-empty space retracts to a point in the obvious way (the constant map yields a retraction). If X is Hausdorff , then A must be closed.  If    r  :   X  →  A      normal-:  r   normal-→  X  A     r:X\to A   is a retraction, then the composition    ι  ∘  r      ι  r    \iota\circ r   is an idempotent continuous map from X to X . Conversely, given any idempotent continuous map    s  :   X  →  X      normal-:  s   normal-→  X  X     s:X\to X   , we obtain a retraction onto the image of s by restricting the codomain.  A space X is known as an absolute retract if for every normal space  Y that contains X as a closed subspace, X is a retract of Y . The unit cube  I n as well as the Hilbert cube  I ω are absolute retracts.  Neighborhood retract  If there exists an open set  U such that      A  ⊂  U  ⊂  X        A  U       X     A\subset U\subset X     and A is a retract of U , then A is called a neighborhood retract of X .  A space X is an absolute neighborhood retract (or ANR ) if for every normal space Y that embeds X as a closed subset, X is a neighborhood retract of Y . The n -sphere S n is an absolute neighborhood retract.  Deformation retract and strong deformation retract  A continuous map      F  :    X  ×   [  0  ,  1  ]    →   X       normal-:  F   normal-→    X   0  1    X     F:X\times[0,1]\to X\,     is a deformation retraction of a space X onto a subspace A if, for every x in X and a in A ,         F   (  x  ,  0  )    =  x   ,     F   (  x  ,  1  )    ∈   A  ,  and      F   (  a  ,  1  )    =  a     .     formulae-sequence      F   x  0    x    formulae-sequence      F   x  1     A  and        F   a  1    a      F(x,0)=x,\;F(x,1)\in A,\quad\mbox{and}\quad F(a,1)=a.     In other words, a deformation retraction is a homotopy between a retraction and the identity map on X . The subspace A is called a deformation retract of X . A deformation retraction is a special case of homotopy equivalence .  A retract need not be a deformation retract. For instance, having a single point as a deformation retract would imply a space is path connected (in fact, it would imply contractibility of the space).  Note: An equivalent definition of deformation retraction is the following. A continuous map r : X → A is a deformation retraction if it is a retraction and its composition with the inclusion is homotopic to the identity map on X . In this formulation, a deformation retraction carries with it a homotopy between the identity map on X and itself.  If, in the definition of a deformation retraction, we add the requirement that       F   (  a  ,  t  )    =   a         F   a  t    a    F(a,t)=a\,     for all t in [0, 1] and a in A , then F is called a strong deformation retraction . In other words, a strong deformation retraction leaves points in A fixed throughout the homotopy. (Some authors, such as Allen Hatcher , take this as the definition of deformation retraction.)  As an example, the n -sphere  S n is a strong deformation retract of R n +1 \{0}; as strong deformation retraction one can choose the map        F   (  x  ,  t  )    =    (    (   1  -  t   )   +   t   ∥  x  ∥     )   x    .        F   x  t          1  t     t   norm  x     x     F(x,t)=\left((1-t)+{t\over\|x\|}\right)x.     Neighborhood deformation retract  A closed subspace A is a neighborhood deformation retract of X if there exists a continuous map    u  :   X  →  I      normal-:  u   normal-→  X  I     u:X\rightarrow I   (where    I  =   [  0  ,  1  ]       I   0  1     I=[0,1]   ) such that    A  =    u   -  1     (  0  )        A     superscript  u    1    0     A=u^{-1}(0)   and a homotopy    H  :    X  ×  I   →  X      normal-:  H   normal-→    X  I   X     H:X\times I\rightarrow X   such that     H   (  x  ,  0  )    =  x        H   x  0    x    H(x,0)=x   for all    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   ,     H   (  a  ,  t  )    =  a        H   a  t    a    H(a,t)=a   for all     (  a  ,  t  )   ∈   A  ×  I        a  t     A  I     (a,t)\in A\times I   , and     h   (  x  ,  1  )    ∈  A        h   x  1    A    h(x,1)\in A   for all    x  ∈    u   -  1     [  0  ,  1  )        x     superscript  u    1     0  1      x\in u^{-1}[0,1)   . 2  Properties   The main obvious property of a retract A of X is that any continuous map    f  :   A  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  Y     f:A\rightarrow Y   has at least one extension     g  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  g   normal-→  X  Y     g:X\rightarrow Y   , namely,    g  =   f  ∘   r        g    f  r     g=f\circ r\,   .    Deformation retraction is a particular case of homotopy equivalence. In fact, two spaces are homotopy equivalent  if and only if they are both deformation retracts of a single larger space.    Any topological space which deformation retracts to a point is contractible and vice versa. However, there exist contractible spaces which do not strongly deformation retract to a point. 3   Notes  References   J.P.
