   Lavandulyl diphosphate synthase      Lavandulyl diphosphate synthase   In enzymology , a lavandulyl diphosphate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 dimethylallyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + lavandulyl diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , dimethylallyl diphosphate , and two products , diphosphate and lavandulyl diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dimethylallyl-diphosphate:dimethylallyl-diphosphate dimethylallyltransferase (lavandulyl-diphosphate-forming) . This enzyme is also called FDS-5 .
