   Nambu mechanics      Nambu mechanics   In mathematics , Nambu dynamics is a generalization of Hamiltonian mechanics involving multiple Hamiltonians. Recall that Hamiltonian mechanics is based upon the flows generated by a smooth Hamiltonian over a symplectic manifold . The flows are symplectomorphisms and hence obey Liouville's theorem . This was soon generalized to flows generated by a Hamiltonian over a Poisson manifold . In 1973, Yoichiro Nambu suggested a generalization involving Nambu-Poisson manifolds with more than one Hamiltonian. 1  Specifically, consider a differential manifold M, for some integer N ≥ 2; one has a smooth N -linear map from N copies of C ∞ ( M ) to itself, such that it is completely antisymmetric: the Nambu bracket , { h 1 , ..., h N −1 , .}, which acts as a derivation { h 1 , ..., h N −1 , fg } = { h 1 , ..., h N −1 , f } g + f { h 1 , ..., h N −1 , g }; whence the Filippov Identities (FI), 2 (evocative of the Jacobi identities , but unlike them, not antisymmetrized in all arguments, for N ≥ 2 ):       {   f  1   ,  ⋯  ,   f   N  -  1    ,   {   g  1   ,  ⋯  ,   g  N   }   }   =    {   {   f  1   ,  ⋯  ,   f   N  -  1    ,   g  1   }   ,   g  2   ,  ⋯  ,   g  N   }   +   {   g  1   ,   {   f  1   ,  ⋯  ,   f   N  -  1    ,   g  2   }   ,  ⋯  ,   g  N   }   +  …         subscript  f  1   normal-⋯   subscript  f    N  1      subscript  g  1   normal-⋯   subscript  g  N          subscript  f  1   normal-⋯   subscript  f    N  1     subscript  g  1     subscript  g  2   normal-⋯   subscript  g  N      subscript  g  1     subscript  f  1   normal-⋯   subscript  f    N  1     subscript  g  2    normal-⋯   subscript  g  N    normal-…     \{f_{1},\cdots,~{}f_{N-1},~{}\{g_{1},\cdots,~{}g_{N}\}\}=\{\{f_{1},\cdots,~{}f%

 }g_{2}\},\cdots,g_{N}\}+\dots        +   {   g  1   ,  ⋯  ,   g   N  -  1    ,   {   f  1   ,  ⋯  ,   f   N  -  1    ,   g  N   }   }    ,        subscript  g  1   normal-⋯   subscript  g    N  1      subscript  f  1   normal-⋯   subscript  f    N  1     subscript  g  N       +\{g_{1},\cdots,g_{N-1},\{f_{1},\cdots,f_{N-1},~{}g_{N}\}\},     so that { f 1 , ..., f N −1 , •} acts as a generalized derivation over the N -fold product {. ,..., .}.  There are N − 1 Hamiltonians, H 1 , ..., H N −1 , generating an incompressible flow ,    d ⁄ dt f= { f , H 1 , ..., H N −1 }.     The generalized phase-space velocity is divergenceless, enabling Liouville's theorem . The case N = 2 reduces to a Poisson manifold , and conventional Hamiltonian mechanics.  For larger even N , the N −1 Hamiltonians identify with the maximal number of independent invariants of motion (cf. Conserved quantity ) characterizing a superintegrable system which evolves in N -dimensional phase space . Such systems are also describable by conventional Hamiltonian dynamics ; but their description in the framework of Nambu mechanics is substantially more elegant and intuitive, as all invariants enjoy the same geometrical status as the Hamiltonian: the trajectory in phase space is the intersection of the N −1 hypersurfaces specified by these invariants. Thus, the flow is perpendicular to all N −1 gradients of these Hamiltonians, whence parallel to the generalized cross product specified by the respective Nambu bracket.  Quantizing Nambu dynamics leads to intriguing structures 3 which coincide with conventional quantization ones when superintegrable systems are involved—as they must.
