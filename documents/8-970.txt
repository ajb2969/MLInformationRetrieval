Mixed complementarity problem

Mixed Complementarity Problem (MCP) is a problem formulation in mathematical programming. Many well-known problem types are special cases of, or may be reduced to MCP. It is a generalization of Nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP).
Definition
The mixed complementarity problem is defined by a mapping 
 
 
 
 , lower values 
 
 
 
  and upper values 
 
 
 
 .
The solution of the MCP is a vector 
 
 
 
  such that for each index 
 
 
 
  one of the following alternatives holds:



 
 ;


 
 ;


 
 .

Another definition for MCP is: it is a variational inequality on the parallelepiped
