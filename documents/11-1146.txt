   Toeplitz operator      Toeplitz operator   In operator theory , a Toeplitz operator is the compression of a multiplication operator on the circle to the Hardy space .  Details  Let S 1 be the circle, with the standard Lebesgue measure, and L 2 ( S 1 ) be the Hilbert space of square-integrable functions. A bounded measurable function g on S 1 defines a multiplication operator  M g on L 2 ( S 1 ). Let P be the projection from L 2 ( S 1 ) onto the Hardy space H 2 . The Toeplitz operator with symbol g is defined by        T  g   =     P   M  g    |    H  2     ,       subscript  T  g    evaluated-at    P   subscript  M  g     superscript  H  2      T_{g}=PM_{g}|_{H^{2}},     where " | " means restriction.  A bounded operator on H 2 is Toeplitz if and only if its matrix representation, in the basis { z n , n â‰¥ 0}, has constant diagonals.  References    .   .   .
