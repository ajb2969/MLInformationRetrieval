In probability theory, a log-normal (or lognormal) distribution is a continuous probability distribution of a random variable whose logarithm is normally distributed. Thus, if the random variable 
 
 
 
  is log-normally distributed, then 
 
 
 
  has a normal distribution. Likewise, if 
 
 
 
  has a normal distribution, then 
 
 
 
 
  has a log-normal distribution. A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values. The distribution is occasionally referred to as the Galton distribution or Galton's distribution, after Francis Galton.1 The log-normal distribution also has been associated with other names, such as McAlister, Gibrat and Cobb–Douglas.2
A log-normal process is the statistical realization of the multiplicative product of many independent random variables, each of which is positive. This is justified by considering the central limit theorem in the log domain. The log-normal distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate 
 
 
 
  for which the mean and variance of 
 
 
 
  are specified.3
Notation
Given a log-normally distributed random variable 
 
 
 
  and two parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  that are, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of the variable’s natural logarithm, then the logarithm of 
 
 
 
  is normally distributed, and we can write 
 
 
 
  as


 
  with 
 
 
 
  a standard normal variable.
This relationship is true regardless of the base of the logarithmic or exponential function. If 
 
 
 
 
  is normally distributed, then so is 
 
 
 
 , for any two positive numbers 
 
 
 
 . Likewise, if 
 
 
 
  is log-normally distributed, then so is 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is a positive number 
 
 
 
 .
On a logarithmic scale, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be called the location parameter and the scale parameter, respectively.
In contrast, the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the non-logarithmized sample values are respectively denoted 
 
 
 
 , s.d., and 
 
 
 
 
  in this article. The two sets of parameters can be related as (see also Arithmetic moments below)4

Characterization
Probability density function
A random positive variable 
 
 
 
  is log-normally distributed if the logarithm of 
 
 
 
  is normally distributed,



A change of variables must conserve differential probability. In particular,



where



is the log-normal probability density function.5
Cumulative distribution function
The cumulative distribution function is


 
  where erfc is the complementary error function, and Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.
Characteristic function and moment generating function
All moments of the log-normal distribution exist and it holds that
 
 
 
  (which can be derived by letting 
 
 
 
  within the integral). However, the expected value 
 
 
 
 
  is not defined for any positive value of the argument 
 
 
 
  as the defining integral diverges. In consequence the moment generating function is not defined.6 The last is related to the fact that the lognormal distribution is not uniquely determined by its moments.
Similarly, the characteristic function

 
  is not defined in the half complex plane and therefore it is not analytic in the origin. In consequence, the characteristic function of the log-normal distribution cannot be represented as an infinite convergent series.7 In particular, its Taylor formal series

 
  diverges. However, a number of alternative divergent series representations have been obtained891011
A closed-form formula for the characteristic function 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  in the domain of convergence is not known. A relatively simple approximating formula is available in closed form and given by12


where 
 
 
 
  is the Lambert W function. This approximation is derived via an asymptotic method but it stays sharp all over the domain of convergence of 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
Location and scale
The location and scale parameters of a log-normal distribution, i.e. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , are more readily treated using the geometric mean, 
 
 
 
 , and the geometric standard deviation, 
 
 
 
 , rather than the arithmetic mean, 
 
 
 
 , and the arithmetic standard deviation, 
 
 
 
 .
Geometric moments
The geometric mean of the log-normal distribution is 
 
 
 
 
 , and the geometric standard deviation is 
 
 
 
 .1314 By analogy with the arithmetic statistics, one can define a geometric variance, 
 
 
 
 , and a geometric coefficient of variation,15

 
 .
Because the log-transformed variable 
 
 
 
  is symmetric and quantiles are preserved under monotonic transformations, the geometric mean of a log-normal distribution is equal to its median, 
 
 
 
 
 .16
Note that the geometric mean is less than the arithmetic mean. This is due to the AM–GM inequality, and corresponds to the logarithm being convex down. In fact,


 
 
  In finance the term 
 
 
 
  is sometimes interpreted as a convexity correction. From the point of view of stochastic calculus, this is the same correction term as in Itō's lemma for geometric Brownian motion.
Arithmetic moments
The arithmetic mean, arithmetic variance, and arithmetic standard deviation of a log-normally distributed variable 
 
 
 
  are given by


 
 
  respectively.
The location (
 
 
 
 ) and scale (
 
 
 
 ) parameters can be obtained if the arithmetic mean and the arithmetic variance are known; it is simpler if 
 
 
 
  is computed first:



For any real or complex number 
 
 
 
 , the 
 
 
th moment of a log-normally distributed variable 
 
 
 
  is given by17


 
  A log-normal distribution is not uniquely determined by its moments 
 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , that is, there exists some other distribution with the same moments for all 
 
 
 
 .18 In fact, there is a whole family of distributions with the same moments as the log-normal distribution.
Mode and median
 The mode is the point of global maximum of the probability density function. In particular, it solves the equation 
 
 
 
 :



The median is such a point where 
 
 
 
 
 :



Arithmetic coefficient of variation
The arithmetic coefficient of variation

 
  is the ratio 
 
 
 
  (on the natural scale). For a log-normal distribution it is equal to


 
  Contrary to the arithmetic standard deviation, the arithmetic coefficient of variation is independent of the arithmetic mean.
Partial expectation
The partial expectation of a random variable 
 
 
 
 
  with respect to a threshold 
 
 
 
  is defined as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the probability density function of 
 
 
 
 . Alternatively, and using the definition of conditional expectation, it can be written as 
 
 
 
 
 . For a log-normal random variable the partial expectation is given by:



Where Phi is the normal cumulative distribution function. The derivation of the formula is provided in the discussion of this Wikipedia entry. The partial expectation formula has applications in insurance and economics, it is used in solving the partial differential equation leading to the Black–Scholes formula.
Other
A set of data that arises from the log-normal distribution has a symmetric Lorenz curve (see also Lorenz asymmetry coefficient).19
The harmonic 
 
 
 
 , geometric 
 
 
 
  and arithmetic 
 
 
 
  means of this distribution are related;20 such relation is given by



Log-normal distributions are infinitely divisible.21
Occurrence
The log-normal distribution is important in the description of natural phenomena. The reason is that for many natural processes of growth, relative growth rate is independent of size. This is also known as Gibrat's law, after Robert Gibrat (1904–1980) who formulated it for companies. It can be shown that a growth process following Gibrat's law will result in entity sizes with a log-normal distribution.22 Examples include:

In biology and medicine,
 
Measures of size of living tissue (length, skin area, weight);23
For highly communicable epidemics, such as SARS in 2003, if publication intervention is involved, the number of hospitalized cases is shown to satistfy the lognormal distribution with no free parameters if an entropy is assumed and the standard deviation is determined by the principle of maximum rate of entropy production.24
The length of inert appendages (hair, claws, nails, teeth) of biological specimens, in the direction of growth;
Certain physiological measurements, such as blood pressure of adult humans (after separation on male/female subpopulations)25

Consequently, reference ranges for measurements in healthy individuals are more accurately estimated by assuming a log-normal distribution than by assuming a symmetric distribution about the mean.

Particle size distributions
Molar mass distributions



In hydrology, the log-normal distribution is used to analyze extreme values of such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes.26

The image on the right illustrates an example of fitting the log-normal distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of a cumulative frequency analysis.



In social sciences and demographics
 
In economics, there is evidence that the income of 97%–99% of the population is distributed log-normally.27 (The distribution of higher-income individuals follows a Pareto distribution.28)
In finance, in particular the Black–Scholes model, changes in the logarithm of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal29 (these variables behave like compound interest, not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). However, some mathematicians such as Benoît Mandelbrot have argued 30 that log-Lévy distributions which possesses heavy tails would be a more appropriate model, in particular for the analysis for stock market crashes. Indeed, stock price distributions typically exhibit a fat tail.31

Technology
 
In reliability analysis, the lognormal distribution is often used to model times to repair a maintainable system.32
In wireless communication, "the local-mean power expressed in logarithmic values, such as dB or neper, has a normal (i.e., Gaussian) distribution." 33 Also, the random obstruction of radio signals due to large buildings and hills, called shadowing, is often modeled as a lognormal distribution.
It has been proposed that coefficients of friction and wear may be treated as having a lognormal distribution 34
In spray process, such as droplet impact, the size of secondary produced droplet has a lognormal distribution, with the standard deviation ：
 
 
 
  determined by the principle of maximum rate of entropy production35 If the lognormal distribution is inserted into the Shannon entropy expression and if the rate of entropy production is maximized (principle of maximum rate of entropy production), then σ is given by 
 
 
36 and with this parameter the droplet size distribution for spray process is well predicted. It is an open question whether this value of σ has some generality for other cases, though for spreading of communicable epidemics, σ is shown also to take this value.37
Particle size distributions produced by comminution with random impacts, such as in ball milling
The file size distribution of publicly available audio and video data files (MIME types) follows a log-normal distribution over five orders of magnitude.38


Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters
For determining the maximum likelihood estimators of the log-normal distribution parameters μ and σ, we can use the same procedure as for the normal distribution. To avoid repetition, we observe that



where by 
 
 
 
  we denote the probability density function of the log-normal distribution and by 
 
 
 
  that of the normal distribution. Therefore, using the same indices to denote distributions, we can write the log-likelihood function thus:



Since the first term is constant with regard to μ and σ, both logarithmic likelihood functions, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , reach their maximum with the same 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Hence, using the formulas for the normal distribution maximum likelihood parameter estimators and the equality above, we deduce that for the log-normal distribution it holds that



Multivariate log-normal
If 
 
 
 
  is a multivariate normal distribution then 
 
 
 
  has a multivariate log-normal distribution39 with mean



and covariance matrix

  has no closed-form expression, but can be reasonably approximated by another log-normal distribution 
 
 
 
  at the right tail.40 Its probability density function at the neighborhood of 0 has been characterized41 and it does not resemble any log-normal distribution. A commonly used approximation due to L.F. Fenton (but previously stated by R.I. Wilkinson and mathematical justified by Marlow42) is obtained by matching the mean and variance of another lognormal distribution:



 
 
  In the case that all 
 
 
 
  have the same variance parameter 
 
 
 
 , these formulas simplify to

A substitute for the log-normal whose integral can be expressed in terms of more elementary functions43 can be obtained based on the logistic distribution to get an approximation for the CDF
