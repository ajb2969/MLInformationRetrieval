Thus, if the random variable   X   X   X   is log-normally distributed, then    Y  =   ln   (  X  )        Y    X     Y=\ln(X)   has a normal distribution. Likewise, if   Y   Y   Y   has a normal distribution, then    X  =   exp   (  Y  )        X    Y     X=\exp(Y)   has a log-normal distribution. A random variable which is log-normally distributed takes only positive real values. The distribution is occasionally referred to as the Galton distribution or Galton's distribution , after Francis Galton . 1 The log-normal distribution also has been associated with other names, such as McAlister, Gibrat and Cobb–Douglas . 2  A log-normal process is the statistical realization of the multiplicative product of many independent  random variables , each of which is positive. This is justified by considering the central limit theorem in the log domain. The log-normal distribution is the maximum entropy probability distribution for a random variate   X   X   X   for which the mean and variance of    ln   (  X  )       X    \ln(X)   are specified. 3  Notation  Given a log-normally distributed random variable   X   X   X   and two parameters   μ   μ   \mu   and   σ   σ   \sigma   that are, respectively, the mean and standard deviation of the variable’s natural logarithm , then the logarithm of   X   X   X   is normally distributed, and we can write   X   X   X   as      X  =   e   μ  +   σ  Z         X   superscript  e    μ    σ  Z       X=e^{\mu+\sigma Z}   with   Z   Z   Z   a standard normal variable .  This relationship is true regardless of the base of the logarithmic or exponential function. If     log  a    (  Y  )       subscript   a   Y    \log_{a}(Y)   is normally distributed, then so is     log  b    (  Y  )       subscript   b   Y    \log_{b}(Y)   , for any two positive numbers     a  ,  b   ≠  1       a  b   1    a,b\neq 1   . Likewise, if    e  X     superscript  e  X    e^{X}   is log-normally distributed, then so is    a  X     superscript  a  X    a^{X}   , where   a   a   a   is a positive number     ≠  1      absent  1    \neq 1   .  On a logarithmic scale,   μ   μ   \mu   and   σ   σ   \sigma   can be called the location parameter and the scale parameter , respectively.  In contrast, the mean, standard deviation, and variance of the non-logarithmized sample values are respectively denoted   m   m   m   , s.d. , and   v   v   v   in this article. The two sets of parameters can be related as (see also Arithmetic moments below) 4       μ  =   ln   (   m    1  +   v   m  2       )     ,   σ  =    ln   (   1  +   v   m  2     )         formulae-sequence    μ      m      1    v   superscript  m  2           σ        1    v   superscript  m  2          \mu=\ln\left(\frac{m}{\sqrt{1+\frac{v}{m^{2}}}}\right),\sigma=\sqrt{\ln\left(1%
 +\frac{v}{m^{2}}\right)}   .  Characterization  Probability density function  A random positive variable   x   x   x   is log-normally distributed if the logarithm of   x   x   x   is normally distributed,        𝒩   (   ln  x   ;  μ  ,  σ  )    =    1   σ    2  π       exp   [   -     (    ln  x   -  μ   )   2    2   σ  2      ]      ,   x  >  0.      formulae-sequence      𝒩     ln  x   μ  σ        1    σ      2  π             superscript      ln  x   μ   2     2   superscript  σ  2           x  0.     \mathcal{N}(\mbox{ln}x;\mu,\sigma)=\frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}\exp\left[-\frac%
 {(\mbox{ln}x-\mu)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}}\right],\ \ x>0.     A change of variables must conserve differential probability. In particular,        𝒩   (   ln  x   )   d  ln  x   =   𝒩   (   ln  x   )     d  ln  x    d  x    d  x   =   𝒩   (   ln  x   )     d  x   x    =    ln  𝒩    (  x  )   d  x    ,          𝒩    ln  x   d  ln  x     𝒩    ln  x       d  ln  x     d  x    d  x          𝒩    ln  x       d  x   x             𝒩   x  d  x      \mathcal{N}(\mbox{ln}x)d\mbox{ln}x=\mathcal{N}(\mbox{ln}x)\frac{d\mbox{ln}x}{%

 \operatorname{erf}\!\left(\frac{\ln x-\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}\right)\right]=\frac%
 {1}{2}\operatorname{erfc}\!\left(-\frac{\ln x-\mu}{\sigma\sqrt{2}}\right)=\Phi%
 \bigg(\frac{\ln x-\mu}{\sigma}\bigg),   where erfc is the complementary error function , and Φ is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal distribution.  Characteristic function and moment generating function  All moments of the log-normal distribution exist and it holds that     E   [   X  n   ]    =   e    n  μ   +     n  2    σ  2    2          normal-E   superscript  X  n     superscript  normal-e      n  μ        superscript  n  2    superscript  σ  2    2       \operatorname{E}[X^{n}]=\mathrm{e}^{n\mu+\frac{n^{2}\sigma^{2}}{2}}   (which can be derived by letting    z  =     ln   (  x  )    -   (   μ  +   n   σ  2     )    σ       z        x     μ    n   superscript  σ  2      σ     z=\frac{\ln(x)-(\mu+n\sigma^{2})}{\sigma}   within the integral). However, the expected value    E   [   e   t  X    ]      normal-E   superscript  e    t  X      \operatorname{E}[e^{tX}]   is not defined for any positive value of the argument   t   t   t   as the defining integral diverges. In consequence the moment generating function is not defined. 6 The last is related to the fact that the lognormal distribution is not uniquely determined by its moments.  Similarly, the characteristic function     E   [   e   i  t  X    ]      normal-E   superscript  e    i  t  X      \operatorname{E}[e^{itX}]   is not defined in the half complex plane and therefore it is not analytic in the origin. In consequence, the characteristic function of the log-normal distribution cannot be represented as an infinite convergent series. 7 In particular, its Taylor formal series      ∑   n  =  0   ∞       (   i  t   )   n    n  !     e    n  μ   +     n  2    σ  2    /  2          superscript   subscript     n  0           superscript    i  t   n     n     superscript  e      n  μ        superscript  n  2    superscript  σ  2    2        \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{(it)^{n}}{n!}e^{n\mu+n^{2}\sigma^{2}/2}   diverges. However, a number of alternative divergent series representations have been obtained 8 9 10 11  A closed-form formula for the characteristic function    φ   (  t  )       φ  t    \varphi(t)   with   t   t   t   in the domain of convergence is not known. A relatively simple approximating formula is available in closed form and given by 12      φ   (  t  )    ≈    exp   (   -       W  2    (   t   σ  2    e  μ    )    +   2  W   (   t   σ  2    e  μ    )      2   σ  2       )      1  +   W   (   t   σ  2    e  μ    )             φ  t                superscript  W  2     t   superscript  σ  2    superscript  e  μ       2  W    t   superscript  σ  2    superscript  e  μ        2   superscript  σ  2           1    W    t   superscript  σ  2    superscript  e  μ          \varphi(t)\approx\frac{\exp\bigg(-\dfrac{W^{2}(t\sigma^{2}e^{\mu})+2W(t\sigma^%
 {2}e^{\mu})}{2\sigma^{2}}\bigg)}{\sqrt{1+W(t\sigma^{2}e^{\mu})}}     where   W   W   W   is the Lambert W function . This approximation is derived via an asymptotic method but it stays sharp all over the domain of convergence of   φ   φ   \varphi   .  Properties  Location and scale  The location and scale parameters of a log-normal distribution, i.e.   μ   μ   \mu   and   σ   σ   \sigma   , are more readily treated using the geometric mean ,    GM   [  X  ]       GM   delimited-[]  X     \mathrm{GM}[X]   , and the geometric standard deviation ,    GSD   [  X  ]       GSD   delimited-[]  X     \mathrm{GSD}[X]   , rather than the arithmetic mean ,    E   [  X  ]       normal-E   delimited-[]  X     \mathrm{E}[X]   , and the arithmetic standard deviation ,    SD   [  X  ]       SD   delimited-[]  X     \mathrm{SD}[X]   .  Geometric moments  The geometric mean of the log-normal distribution is     GM   [  X  ]    =   e  μ         GM   delimited-[]  X     superscript  e  μ     \mathrm{GM}[X]=e^{\mu}   , and the geometric standard deviation is     GSD   [  X  ]    =   e  σ         GSD   delimited-[]  X     superscript  e  σ     \mathrm{GSD}[X]=e^{\sigma}   . 13 14 By analogy with the arithmetic statistics, one can define a geometric variance,     GVar   [  X  ]    =   e   σ  2          GVar   delimited-[]  X     superscript  e   superscript  σ  2      \mathrm{GVar}[X]=e^{\sigma^{2}}   , and a geometric coefficient of variation , 15      GCV   [  X  ]    =    e  σ   -  1         GCV   delimited-[]  X       superscript  e  σ   1     \mathrm{GCV}[X]=e^{\sigma}-1   .  Because the log-transformed variable    Y  =   ln  X       Y    X     Y=\ln X   is symmetric and quantiles are preserved under monotonic transformations, the geometric mean of a log-normal distribution is equal to its median,    Med   [  X  ]       Med   delimited-[]  X     \mathrm{Med}[X]   . 16  Note that the geometric mean is less than the arithmetic mean. This is due to the AM–GM inequality , and corresponds to the logarithm being convex down. In fact,      E   [  X  ]       normal-E   delimited-[]  X     \displaystyle\mathrm{E}[X]   In finance the term    e   -    1  2    σ  2        superscript  e        1  2    superscript  σ  2       e^{-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}}   is sometimes interpreted as a convexity correction . From the point of view of stochastic calculus , this is the same correction term as in Itō's lemma for geometric Brownian motion .  Arithmetic moments  The arithmetic mean, arithmetic variance, and arithmetic standard deviation of a log-normally distributed variable   X   X   X   are given by        E   [  X  ]    =   e   μ  +     1  2     σ  2       ,       normal-E  X    superscript  e    μ      1  2    superscript  σ  2        \displaystyle\operatorname{E}[X]=e^{\mu+\tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}},   respectively.  The location (   μ   μ   \mu   ) and scale (   σ   σ   \sigma   ) parameters can be obtained if the arithmetic mean and the arithmetic variance are known; it is simpler if   σ   σ   \sigma   is computed first:     μ   μ   \displaystyle\mu     For any real or complex number   s   s   s   , the   s   s   s    th  moment of a log-normally distributed variable   X   X   X   is given by 17        E   [   X  s   ]    =   e    s  μ   +    1  2    s  2    σ  2       .       normal-E   superscript  X  s     superscript  e      s  μ       1  2    superscript  s  2    superscript  σ  2        \operatorname{E}[X^{s}]=e^{s\mu+\frac{1}{2}s^{2}\sigma^{2}}.   A log-normal distribution is not uniquely determined by its moments    E   [   X  k   ]      normal-E   superscript  X  k     \operatorname{E}[X^{k}]   for    k  ≥  1      k  1    k\geq 1   , that is, there exists some other distribution with the same moments for all   k   k   k   . 18 In fact, there is a whole family of distributions with the same moments as the log-normal distribution.  Mode and median  The mode is the point of global maximum of the probability density function. In particular, it solves the equation      (   ln  f   )   ′   =  0       superscript    f   normal-′   0    (\ln f)^{\prime}=0   :        Mode   [  X  ]    =   e   μ  -   σ  2      .        Mode   delimited-[]  X     superscript  e    μ   superscript  σ  2       \mathrm{Mode}[X]=e^{\mu-\sigma^{2}}.     The median is such a point where     F  X   =  0.5       subscript  F  X   0.5    F_{X}=0.5   :        Med   [  X  ]    =    e  μ     .        Med   delimited-[]  X     superscript  e  μ     \mathrm{Med}[X]=e^{\mu}\,.     Arithmetic coefficient of variation  The arithmetic coefficient of variation     CV   [  X  ]       CV   delimited-[]  X     \mathrm{CV}[X]   is the ratio     SD   [  X  ]     E   [  X  ]          SD   delimited-[]  X      normal-E   delimited-[]  X      \frac{\mathrm{SD}[X]}{\mathrm{E}[X]}   (on the natural scale). For a log-normal distribution it is equal to        CV   [  X  ]    =     e   σ  2    -  1     .        CV   delimited-[]  X         superscript  e   superscript  σ  2    1      \mathrm{CV}[X]=\sqrt{e^{\sigma^{2}}-1}.   Contrary to the arithmetic standard deviation, the arithmetic coefficient of variation is independent of the arithmetic mean.  Partial expectation  The partial expectation of a random variable   X   X   X   with respect to a threshold   k   k   k   is defined as     g   (  k  )    =     ∫  k  ∞     x   ln  𝒩    (  x  )   d  x          g  k     superscript   subscript   k       x    𝒩   x  d  x      g(k)=\int_{k}^{\infty}\!x{\ln\mathcal{N}}(x)\,dx   where     ln  𝒩    (  x  )         𝒩   x    {\ln\mathcal{N}}(x)   is the probability density function of   X   X   X   . Alternatively, and using the definition of conditional expectation , it can be written as    g   (  k  )   =  E   [  X  |  X  >  k  ]   P   (  X  >  k  )      fragments  g   fragments  normal-(  k  normal-)    normal-E   fragments  normal-[  X  normal-|  X   k  normal-]   P   fragments  normal-(  X   k  normal-)     g(k)=\operatorname{E}[X|X>k]P(X>k)   . For a log-normal random variable the partial expectation is given by:        g   (  k  )    =     ∫  k  ∞     x   ln  𝒩    (  x  )   d  x    =     e   μ  +     1  2     σ  2        Φ    (     μ  +   σ  2    -   ln  k    σ   )     .          g  k     superscript   subscript   k       x    𝒩   x  d  x            superscript  e    μ      1  2    superscript  σ  2      normal-Φ        μ   superscript  σ  2      k    σ       g(k)=\int_{k}^{\infty}\!x{\ln\mathcal{N}}(x)\,dx=e^{\mu+\tfrac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}%

The partial expectation formula has applications in insurance and economics, it is used in solving the partial differential equation leading to the Black–Scholes formula .  Other  A set of data that arises from the log-normal distribution has a symmetric Lorenz curve (see also Lorenz asymmetry coefficient ). 19  The harmonic   H   H   H   , geometric   G   G   G   and arithmetic   A   A   A   means of this distribution are related; 20 such relation is given by       H  =    G  2   A    .      H     superscript  G  2   A     H=\frac{G^{2}}{A}.     Log-normal distributions are infinitely divisible . 21  Occurrence  The log-normal distribution is important in the description of natural phenomena. The reason is that for many natural processes of growth, relative growth rate is independent of size. This is also known as Gibrat's law , after Robert Gibrat (1904–1980) who formulated it for companies. It can be shown that a growth process following Gibrat's law will result in entity sizes with a log-normal distribution. 22 Examples include:   In biology and medicine ,  Measures of size of living tissue (length, skin area, weight); 23  For highly communicable epidemics, such as SARS in 2003, if publication intervention is involved, the number of hospitalized cases is shown to satistfy the lognormal distribution with no free parameters if an entropy is assumed and the standard deviation is determined by the principle of maximum rate of entropy production. 24  The length of inert appendages (hair, claws, nails, teeth) of biological specimens, in the direction of growth;  Certain physiological measurements, such as blood pressure of adult humans (after separation on male/female subpopulations) 25    (Figure)  Fitted cumulative log-normal distribution to annually maximum 1-day rainfalls, see distribution fitting     Consequently, reference ranges for measurements in healthy individuals are more accurately estimated by assuming a log-normal distribution than by assuming a symmetric distribution about the mean.    In colloidal chemistry and polymer chemistry   Particle size distributions  Molar mass distributions     In hydrology , the log-normal distribution is used to analyze extreme values of such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes. 26   The image on the right illustrates an example of fitting the log-normal distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution . The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of a cumulative frequency analysis .     In social sciences and demographics  In economics , there is evidence that the income of 97%–99% of the population is distributed log-normally. 27 (The distribution of higher-income individuals follows a Pareto distribution . 28 )  In finance , in particular the Black–Scholes model , changes in the logarithm of exchange rates, price indices, and stock market indices are assumed normal 29 (these variables behave like compound interest, not like simple interest, and so are multiplicative). However, some mathematicians such as Benoît Mandelbrot have argued 30 that log-Lévy distributions which possesses heavy tails would be a more appropriate model, in particular for the analysis for stock market crashes . Indeed, stock price distributions typically exhibit a fat tail . 31  city sizes     Technology  In reliability analysis, the lognormal distribution is often used to model times to repair a maintainable system. 32  In wireless communication , "the local-mean power expressed in logarithmic values, such as dB or neper, has a normal (i.e., Gaussian) distribution." 33 Also, the random obstruction of radio signals due to large buildings and hills, called shadowing , is often modeled as a lognormal distribution.  It has been proposed that coefficients of friction and wear may be treated as having a lognormal distribution 34  In spray process, such as droplet impact, the size of secondary produced droplet has a lognormal distribution, with the standard deviation ：    σ  =    6   6       σ      6   6     \sigma=\frac{\sqrt{6}}{6}   determined by the principle of maximum rate of entropy production 35 If the lognormal distribution is inserted into the Shannon entropy expression and if the rate of entropy production is maximized (principle of maximum rate of entropy production), then σ is given by    σ  =   1   6        σ    1    6      \sigma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{6}}    36 and with this parameter the droplet size distribution for spray process is well predicted. It is an open question whether this value of σ has some generality for other cases, though for spreading of communicable epidemics, σ is shown also to take this value. 37  Particle size distributions produced by comminution with random impacts, such as in ball milling  The file size distribution of publicly available audio and video data files ( MIME types ) follows a log-normal distribution over five orders of magnitude . 38    Maximum likelihood estimation of parameters  For determining the maximum likelihood estimators of the log-normal distribution parameters μ and σ, we can use the same procedure as for the normal distribution . To avoid repetition, we observe that       L   (  x  ;  μ  ,  σ  )    =    ∏   i  =  1   n     (    1  x   i   )   𝒩   (   ln  x   ;  μ  ,  σ  )           L   x  μ  σ      superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n      subscript    1  x   i   𝒩     x   μ  σ       L(x;\mu,\sigma)=\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left(\frac{1}{x}_{i}\right)\,\mathcal{N}(\ln x%
 ;\mu,\sigma)     where by   L   L   L   we denote the probability density function of the log-normal distribution and by   𝒩   𝒩   \mathcal{N}   that of the normal distribution. Therefore, using the same indices to denote distributions, we can write the log-likelihood function thus:       ℓ  L    (  μ  ,  σ  |   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )      fragments   subscript  normal-ℓ  L    fragments  normal-(  μ  normal-,  σ  normal-|   subscript  x  1   normal-,   subscript  x  2   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  x  n   normal-)     \displaystyle\ell_{L}(\mu,\sigma|x_{1},x_{2},\dots,x_{n})     Since the first term is constant with regard to μ and σ, both logarithmic likelihood functions,    ℓ  L     subscript  normal-ℓ  L    \ell_{L}   and    ℓ  N     subscript  normal-ℓ  N    \ell_{N}   , reach their maximum with the same   μ   μ   \mu   and   σ   σ   \sigma   . Hence, using the formulas for the normal distribution maximum likelihood parameter estimators and the equality above, we deduce that for the log-normal distribution it holds that         μ  ^   =     ∑  k    ln   x  k     n    ,     σ  ^   2   =     ∑  k     (    ln   x  k    -   μ  ^    )   2    n     .     formulae-sequence     normal-^  μ       subscript   k      subscript  x  k     n       superscript   normal-^  σ   2       subscript   k    superscript       subscript  x  k     normal-^  μ    2    n      \widehat{\mu}=\frac{\sum_{k}\ln x_{k}}{n},\widehat{\sigma}^{2}=\frac{\sum_{k}%
