   Stagnation enthalpy      Stagnation enthalpy   Stagnation Enthalpy or total enthalpy (    h  t     subscript  h  t    h_{t}   ) is the enthalpy of a flow at a stagnation point . It is the enthalpy a flow would possess if brought to rest (zero velocity) isentropically from velocity   v   v   v   .       h  t   =   h  +    v  2   2         subscript  h  t     h     superscript  v  2   2      h_{t}=h+\frac{v^{2}}{2}     where   h   h   h   is enthalpy, and   v   v   v   is velocity.  Stagnation enthalpy has units of energy, such that if enthalpy is thought of as the energy associated with the temperature plus the energy associated with the pressure, the stagnation enthalpy adds a term associated with the kinetic energy of the fluid mass.
