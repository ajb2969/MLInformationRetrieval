Tetracontagon

In geometry, a tetracontagon or tessaracontagon is a forty-sided polygon.12 The sum of any tetracontagon's interior angles is 6840 degrees.
A regular tetracontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {40} and can also be constructed as a quasiregular truncated icosagon, t{20}, which alternates two types of edges.
Regular tetracontagon properties
One interior angle in a regular tetracontagon is 171°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 9°.
The area of a regular tetracontagon is (with )



and its inradius is



The factor 
 
 
 
  is a root of the octic equation

 
 
 .
The circumradius of a regular tetracontagon is



A regular tetracontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge.3 As a truncated icosagon, it can be constructed by an edge-bisection of a regular icosagon. This means that the values of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  may be expressed in radicals as follows:






Tetracontagram
A tetracontagram is a 40-sided star polygon. There are 7 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {40/3}, {40/7}, {40/9}, {40/11}, {40/13}, {40/17}, and {40/19}, and 12 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration.

Many isogonal tetracontagrams can also be constructed as deeper truncations of the regular icosagon {20} and icosagrams {20/3}, {20/7}, and {20/9}. These also create four quasitruncations: t{20/11}={40/11}, t{20/13}={40/13}, t{20/17}={40/17}, and t{20/19}={40/19}. Some of the isogonal tetracontagrams are depicted below, as a truncation sequence with endpoints t{20}={40} and t{20/19}={40/19}.4
