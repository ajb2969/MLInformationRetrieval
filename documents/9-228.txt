   Tetracontagon      Tetracontagon   In geometry , a tetracontagon or tessaracontagon is a forty-sided polygon . 1 2 The sum of any tetracontagon's interior angles is 6840 degrees.  A regular tetracontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {40} and can also be constructed as a quasiregular truncated  icosagon , t{20}, which alternates two types of edges.  Regular tetracontagon properties  One interior angle in a regular tetracontagon is 171°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 9°.  The area of a regular tetracontagon is (with )      A  =   10   t  2    cot   π  40         A    10   superscript  t  2       π  40       A=10t^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{40}     and its inradius is      r  =    1  2   t   cot   π  40         r      1  2   t      π  40       r=\frac{1}{2}t\cot\frac{\pi}{40}     The factor    cot   π  40         π  40     \cot\frac{\pi}{40}   is a root of the octic equation         x  8   -   8   x  7    -   60   x  6    -   8   x  5     +   134   x  4    +   8   x  3     -   60   x  2     +   8  x   +  1             superscript  x  8     8   superscript  x  7      60   superscript  x  6      8   superscript  x  5       134   superscript  x  4      8   superscript  x  3       60   superscript  x  2       8  x   1    x^{8}-8x^{7}-60x^{6}-8x^{5}+134x^{4}+8x^{3}-60x^{2}+8x+1   .  The circumradius of a regular tetracontagon is      R  =    1  2   t   csc   π  40         R      1  2   t      π  40       R=\frac{1}{2}t\csc\frac{\pi}{40}     A regular tetracontagon is constructible using a compass and straightedge . 3 As a truncated  icosagon , it can be constructed by an edge- bisection of a regular icosagon. This means that the values of    sin   π  40         π  40     \sin\frac{\pi}{40}   and    cos   π  40         π  40     \cos\frac{\pi}{40}   may be expressed in radicals as follows:       sin   π  40    =     1  4    (    2   -  1   )      1  2    (   2  +   2    )    (   5  +   5    )      -    1  8     2  -   2      (   1  +   2    )    (    5   -  1   )             π  40          1  4       2   1         1  2     2    2      5    5           1  8       2    2       1    2        5   1       \sin\frac{\pi}{40}=\frac{1}{4}(\sqrt{2}-1)\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(2+\sqrt{2})(5+%

There are 7 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {40/3}, {40/7}, {40/9}, {40/11}, {40/13}, {40/17}, and {40/19}, and 12 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration .

These also create four quasitruncations: t{20/11}={40/11}, t{20/13}={40/13}, t{20/17}={40/17}, and t{20/19}={40/19}. Some of the isogonal tetracontagrams are depicted below, as a truncation sequence with endpoints t{20}={40} and t{20/19}={40/19}. 4      t{20}={40}   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_2.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_3.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_4.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_5.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_6.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_7.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_8.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_9.svg   (Figure)  regular_polygon_truncation_20_10.svg    t{20/19}={40/19}      References    Naming Polygons and Polyhedra  [ https://books.google.com/books?id=ugBDAAAAIAAJ&lpg; ;=PA194&ots;=eu5YMWxvXz&dq;=tessaracontagon&pg;=PA194#v=onepage&q;=tessaracontagon&f;=false tessaracontagon]   "  Category:Polygons     . ↩  [ https://books.google.com.sg/books?ei=fpDlVLuCDNCYuQTEx4LwDA&id; ;=wALvAAAAMAAJ&dq;=pentecontagon&q;=hebdomecontagon&redir;_esc=y ''The New Elements of Mathematics: Algebra and Geometry] by Charles Sanders Peirce (1976), p.298 ↩  Constructible Polygon ↩  The Lighter Side of Mathematics: Proceedings of the Eugène Strens Memorial Conference on Recreational Mathematics and its History, (1994), Metamorphoses of polygons , Branko Grünbaum ↩
