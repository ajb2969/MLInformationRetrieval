   Karlsruhe metric      Karlsruhe metric   In metric geometry , the Karlsruhe metric (the name alludes to the layout of the city of Karlsruhe ), also called Moscow metric , is a measure of distance that assumes travel is only possible along radial streets and along circular avenues around the center. 1  The Karlsruhe distance between two points     d  k    (   p  1   ,   p  2   )        subscript  d  k     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2      d_{k}(p_{1},p_{2})   is given as        d  k    (   p  1   ,   p  2   )    =   {          min   (   r  1   ,   r  2   )    ⋅  δ    (   p  1   ,   p  2   )    +   |    r  1   -   r  2    |    ,       if  0   ≤   δ   (   p  1   ,   p  2   )    ≤  2          r  1   +   r  2    ,     otherwise             subscript  d  k     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2      cases       normal-⋅     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    δ     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2          subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2            if  0     δ    subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2          2       subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2    otherwise     d_{k}(p_{1},p_{2})=\begin{cases}\min(r_{1},r_{2})\cdot\delta(p_{1},p_{2})+|r_{%

 r_{1}+r_{2},&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}     where    (   r  i   ,   φ  i   )      subscript  r  i    subscript  φ  i     (r_{i},\varphi_{i})   are the polar coordinates of    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   and     δ   (   p  1   ,   p  2   )    =   min   (   |    φ  1   -   φ  2    |   ,    2  π   -   |    φ  1   -   φ  2    |    )          δ    subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2            subscript  φ  1    subscript  φ  2         2  π        subscript  φ  1    subscript  φ  2         \delta(p_{1},p_{2})=\min(|\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{2}|,2\pi-|\varphi_{1}-\varphi_{%
 2}|)   is the angular distance between the two points.
