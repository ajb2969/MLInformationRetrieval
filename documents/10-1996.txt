   Pantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase      Pantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase   In enzymology , a pantothenoylcysteine decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-[(R)-pantothenoyl]-L-cysteine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pantetheine + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , N-((R)-pantothenoyl)-L-cysteine , and two products , pantetheine and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-[(R)-pantothenoyl]-L-cysteine carboxy-lyase (pantetheine-forming) . Other names in common use include pantothenylcysteine decarboxylase , and N-[(R)-pantothenoyl]-L-cysteine carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis .
