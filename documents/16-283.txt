Coenzyme F420-1:gamma-L-glutamate ligase

Coenzyme F420-1:gamma-L-glutamate ligase (, F420:gamma-glutamyl ligase, CofE-AF, MJ0768, CofE) is an enzyme with system name L-glutamate:coenzyme F420-1 ligase (GDP-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

GTP + coenzyme F420-1 + L-glutamate 
 
 
 
  GDP + phosphate + coenzyme gamma-F420-2
 

This protein catalyses the successive addition of two glutamate residues to cofactor F420 by two distinct and independent reactions. I
