   Gyroelongated triangular cupola      Gyroelongated triangular cupola   In geometry , the gyroelongated triangular cupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 22 ). It can be constructed by attaching a hexagonal antiprism to the base of a triangular cupola ( J 3 ). This is called "gyroelongation", which means that an antiprism is joined to the base of a solid, or between the bases of more than one solid.  The gyroelongated triangular cupola can also be seen as a gyroelongated triangular bicupola ( J 44 ) with one triangular cupola removed. Like all cupolae , the base  polygon has twice as many sides as the top (in this case, the bottom polygon is a hexagon because the top is a triangle ).  Formulae  The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    (    1  3      61  2   +   18   3    +   30    1  +   3         )    a  3    ≈   3.51605...   a  3          V        1  3         61  2     18    3      30      1    3          superscript  a  3           3.51605...   superscript  a  3       V=(\frac{1}{3}\sqrt{\frac{61}{2}+18\sqrt{3}+30\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}}})a^{3}\approx 3%
