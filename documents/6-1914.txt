   Kaufmann (Scully) vortex      Kaufmann (Scully) vortex   The Kaufmann vortex, also known as the Scully model, 1 is a mathematical model for a vortex taking account of viscosity . It uses an algebraic velocity profile. 2  Kaufmann and Scully's model for the velocity in the Θ direction is:         V  Θ     (  r  )    =    Γ   2  π     r    r  c  2   +   r  2             subscript  V  normal-Θ   r       normal-Γ    2  π      r     superscript   subscript  r  c   2    superscript  r  2        V_{\Theta}\ (r)=\frac{\Gamma}{2\pi}\frac{r}{r_{c}^{2}+r^{2}}     The model was suggested by Scully and Sullivan in 1972 at Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and earlier by W. Kaufmann in 1962. 3  References  "  Category:Equations of fluid dynamics  Category:Vortices     Mahendra J. Bhagwat and J.
