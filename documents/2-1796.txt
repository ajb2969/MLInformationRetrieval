   Susceptance      Susceptance   In electrical engineering , susceptance ( B ) is the imaginary part of admittance . The inverse of admittance is impedance , and the real part of admittance is conductance . In SI units, susceptance is measured in siemens . Oliver Heaviside first defined this property, which he called permittance , in June 1887. 1  Formula  The general equation defining admittance is given by      Y  =   G  +   j   B         Y    G    j  B      Y=G+jB\,     where   Y is the admittance , measured in siemens.  G is the conductance , measured in siemens.  j is the imaginary unit , and  B is the susceptance, measured in siemens.   The admittance ( Y ) is the inverse of the impedance ( Z )      Y  =   1  Z   =   1   R  +   j  X     =    (   R    R  2   +   X  2     )   +   j   (    -  X     R  2   +   X  2     )           Y    1  Z          1    R    j  X              R     superscript  R  2    superscript  X  2       j      X      superscript  R  2    superscript  X  2          Y=\frac{1}{Z}=\frac{1}{R+jX}=\left(\frac{R}{R^{2}+X^{2}}\right)+j\left(\frac{-%
 X}{R^{2}+X^{2}}\right)\,     or      B  =   I  m   (  Y  )    =   (    -  X     R  2   +   X  2     )   =    -  X     |  Z  |   2          B    I  m  Y            X      superscript  R  2    superscript  X  2              X    superscript    Z   2       B=Im(Y)=\left(\frac{-X}{R^{2}+X^{2}}\right)=\frac{-X}{|Z|^{2}}     where      Z  =   R  +   j   X         Z    R    j  X      Z=R+jX\,      Z is the impedance , measured in ohms   R is the resistance , measured in ohms  X is the reactance , measured in ohms.   Note: The susceptance is the imaginary part of the admittance.  The magnitude of admittance is given by:       |  Y  |   =      G  2   +   B  2            Y        superscript  G  2    superscript  B  2       \left|Y\right|=\sqrt{G^{2}+B^{2}}\,     See also   Electrical measurements  SI electromagnetism units   References  "  Category:Physical quantities  Category:Electrical engineering     â†©
