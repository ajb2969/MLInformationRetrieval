   Autocorrelation technique      Autocorrelation technique   The autocorrelation technique is a method for estimating the dominating frequency in a complex signal, as well as its variance. Specifically, it calculates the first two moments of the power spectrum, namely the mean and variance. It is also known as the pulse-pair algorithm in radar theory.  The algorithm is both computationally faster and significantly more accurate compared to the Fourier transform , since the resolution is not limited by the number of samples used.  Derivation  The autocorrelation of lag 1 can be expressed using the inverse Fourier transform of the power spectrum    S   (  ω  )       S  ω    S(\omega)   :        R   (  1  )    =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π    S   (  ω  )    e    i   ω  1    d  ω      .        R  1       1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π     S  ω   superscript  e    i  ω  1    d  ω       R(1)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}S(\omega)e^{i\,\omega\,1}d\omega.   If we model the power spectrum as a single frequency     S   (  ω  )      =  def     δ   (   ω  -   ω  0    )        superscript   def     S  ω     δ    ω   subscript  ω  0       S(\omega)\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \delta(\omega-\omega_{0})   , this becomes:       R   (  1  )    =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π    δ   (   ω  -   ω  0    )    e    i   ω    d  ω           R  1       1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π     δ    ω   subscript  ω  0     superscript  e    i  ω    d  ω       R(1)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\delta(\omega-\omega_{0})e^{i\,\omega}d\omega          R   (  1  )    =    1   2  π     e    i    ω  0            R  1       1    2  π     superscript  e    i   subscript  ω  0        R(1)=\frac{1}{2\pi}e^{i\,\omega_{0}}   where it is apparent that the phase of    R   (  1  )       R  1    R(1)   equals the signal frequency.  Implementation  The mean frequency is calculated based on the autocorrelation with lag one, evaluated over a signal consisting of N samples:       ω  =   ∠   R  N    (  1  )    =    tan   -  1      i  m   {    R  N    (  1  )    }     r  e   {    R  N    (  1  )    }       .        ω    normal-∠   subscript  R  N   1          superscript     1        i  m      subscript  R  N   1       r  e      subscript  R  N   1          \omega=\angle R_{N}(1)=\tan^{-1}\frac{im\{R_{N}(1)\}}{re\{R_{N}(1)\}}.   The spectral variance is calculated as follows:        v  a  r   {  ω  }    =    2  N    (   1  -    |    R  N    (  1  )    |     R  N    (  0  )      )     .        v  a  r   ω        2  N     1         subscript  R  N   1       subscript  R  N   0        var\{\omega\}=\frac{2}{N}\left(1-\frac{|R_{N}(1)|}{R_{N}(0)}\right).
