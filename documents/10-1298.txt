   Glyoxylate oxidase      Glyoxylate oxidase   In enzymology , a glyoxylate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glyoxylate + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxalate + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are glyoxylate , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its two products are oxalate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glyoxylate:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .
