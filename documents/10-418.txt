   Packing dimension      Packing dimension   In mathematics , the packing dimension is one of a number of concepts that can be used to define the dimension of a subset of a metric space . Packing dimension is in some sense dual to Hausdorff dimension , since packing dimension is constructed by "packing" small open balls inside the given subset, whereas Hausdorff dimension is constructed by covering the given subset by such small open balls. The packing dimension was introduced by C. Tricot Jr. in 1982.  Definitions  Let ( X , d ) be a metric space with a subset S ⊆ X and let s ≥ 0. The s -dimensional packing pre-measure of S is defined to be         P  0  s    (  S  )    =    lim   δ  ↓  0     sup   {    ∑   i  ∈  I     diam    (   B  i   )   s     |        {   B  i   }    i  ∈  I    is a countable collection       of pairwise disjoint closed balls with       diameters  ≤   δ  and centres in  S       }      .         superscript   subscript  P  0   s   S     subscript    normal-↓  δ  0     supremum   conditional-set    subscript     i  I      diam   superscript   subscript  B  i   s          subscript    subscript  B  i      i  I    is a countable collection     of pairwise disjoint closed balls with      diameters    δ  and centres in  S           P_{0}^{s}(S)=\lim_{\delta\downarrow 0}\sup\left\{\left.\sum_{i\in I}\mathrm{%
 diam}(B_{i})^{s}\right|\begin{matrix}\{B_{i}\}_{i\in I}\text{ is a countable %
 collection}\\
 \text{of pairwise disjoint closed balls with}\\
 \text{diameters }\leq\delta\text{ and centres in }S\end{matrix}\right\}.     Unfortunately, this is just a pre-measure and not a true measure on subsets of X , as can be seen by considering dense , countable subsets. However, the pre-measure leads to a bona fide measure: the s -dimensional packing measure of S is defined to be         P  s    (  S  )    =   inf   {    ∑   j  ∈  J      P  0  s    (   S  j   )     |   S  ⊆     ⋃   j  ∈  J     S  j    ,   J  countable     }     ,         superscript  P  s   S    infimum   conditional-set    subscript     j  J       superscript   subscript  P  0   s    subscript  S  j       S     subscript     j  J     subscript  S  j      J  countable         P^{s}(S)=\inf\left\{\left.\sum_{j\in J}P_{0}^{s}(S_{j})\right|S\subseteq%
 \bigcup_{j\in J}S_{j},J\text{ countable}\right\},     i.e., the packing measure of S is the infimum of the packing pre-measures of countable covers of S .  Having done this, the packing dimension dim P ( S ) of S is defined analogously to the Hausdorff dimension:       dim  P    (  S  )       subscript  dimension  normal-P   S    \displaystyle\dim_{\mathrm{P}}(S)     An example  The following example is the simplest situation where Hausdorff and packing dimensions may differ.  Fix a sequence    (   a  n   )     subscript  a  n    (a_{n})   such that     a  0   =  1       subscript  a  0   1    a_{0}=1   and     E  0   =   [  0  ,  1  ]        subscript  E  0    0  1     E_{0}=[0,1]   of compact subsets of the real line as follows: Let    E  n     subscript  E  n    E_{n}   . For each connected component of    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   (which will necessarily be an interval of length     a  n   -   2   a   n  +  1          subscript  a  n     2   subscript  a    n  1       a_{n}-2a_{n+1}   ), delete the middle interval of length    a   n  +  1      subscript  a    n  1     a_{n+1}   , obtaining two intervals of length    E   n  +  1      subscript  E    n  1     E_{n+1}   , which will be taken as connected components of    K  =    ⋂  n    E  n        K    subscript   n    subscript  E  n      K=\bigcap_{n}E_{n}   . Next, define   K   K   K   . Then   K   K   K   is topologically a Cantor set (i.e., a compact totally disconnected perfect space). For example,     a  n   =   3   -  n         subscript  a  n    superscript  3    n      a_{n}=3^{-n}   will be the usual middle-thirds Cantor set if   K   K   K   .  It is possible to show that the Hausdorff and the packing dimensions of the set     dim  H    (  K  )       subscript  dimension  normal-H   K    \displaystyle\dim_{\mathrm{H}}(K)   are given respectively by:      0  ≤   d  1   ≤   d  2   ≤  1        0   subscript  d  1         subscript  d  2        1     0\leq d_{1}\leq d_{2}\leq 1     It follows easily that given numbers    (   a  n   )     subscript  a  n    (a_{n})   , one can choose a sequence   K   K   K   as above such that the associated (topological) Cantor set    d  1     subscript  d  1    d_{1}   has Hausdorff dimension    d  2     subscript  d  2    d_{2}   and packing dimension      P  0  h    (  S  )    =    lim   δ  ↓  0     sup   {    ∑   i  ∈  I     h   (   diam   (   B  i   )    )     |        {   B  i   }    i  ∈  I    is a countable collection       of pairwise disjoint balls with       diameters  ≤   δ  and centres in  S       }            superscript   subscript  P  0   h   S     subscript    normal-↓  δ  0     supremum   conditional-set    subscript     i  I      h    diam   subscript  B  i           subscript    subscript  B  i      i  I    is a countable collection     of pairwise disjoint balls with      diameters    δ  and centres in  S           P_{0}^{h}(S)=\lim_{\delta\downarrow 0}\sup\left\{\left.\sum_{i\in I}h\big(%
 \mathrm{diam}(B_{i})\big)\right|\begin{matrix}\{B_{i}\}_{i\in I}\text{ is a %
 countable collection}\\
 \text{of pairwise disjoint balls with}\\
 \text{diameters }\leq\delta\text{ and centres in }S\end{matrix}\right\}   .  Generalizations  One can consider dimension functions more general than "diameter to the s ": for any function h : [0, +∞) → [0, +∞], let the packing pre-measure of  S  with dimension function  h be given by         P  h    (  S  )    =   inf   {    ∑   j  ∈  J      P  0  h    (   S  j   )     |   S  ⊆     ⋃   j  ∈  J     S  j    ,   J  countable     }     .         superscript  P  h   S    infimum   conditional-set    subscript     j  J       superscript   subscript  P  0   h    subscript  S  j       S     subscript     j  J     subscript  S  j      J  countable         P^{h}(S)=\inf\left\{\left.\sum_{j\in J}P_{0}^{h}(S_{j})\right|S\subseteq%
 \bigcup_{j\in J}S_{j},J\text{ countable}\right\}.     and define the packing measure of  S  with dimension function  h by         dim  P    (  S  )    =     dim  ¯   MB    (  S  )     .        subscript  dimension  normal-P   S      subscript   normal-¯  dimension   MB   S     \dim_{\mathrm{P}}(S)=\overline{\dim}_{\mathrm{MB}}(S).     The function h is said to be an exact ( packing ) dimension function for S if P h ( S ) is both finite and strictly positive.  Properties   If S is a subset of n -dimensional Euclidean space  R n with its usual metric, then the packing dimension of S is equal to the upper modified box dimension of S :     $\dim_{\mathrm{P}} (S) = \overline{\dim}_\mathrm{MB} (S).$       This result is interesting because it shows how a dimension derived from a measure (packing dimension) agrees with one derived without using a measure (the modified box dimension).   Note, however, that the packing dimension is not equal to the box dimension. For example, the set of rationals  Q has box dimension one and packing dimension zero.
