   Attribute-value system      Attribute-value system   An attribute-value system is a basic knowledge representation framework comprising a table with columns designating "attributes" (also known as "properties", "predicates," "features," "dimensions," "characteristics", " fields ", "headers" or "independent variables" depending on the context) and " rows " designating "objects" (also known as "entities," "instances," "exemplars," "elements", " records " or "dependent variables"). Each table cell therefore designates the value (also known as "state") of a particular attribute of a particular object.  Example of attribute-value system  Below is a sample attribute-value system. It represents 10 objects (rows) and five features (columns). In this example, the table contains only integer values. In general, an attribute-value system may contain any kind of data, numeric or otherwise. An attribute-value system is distinguished from a simple "feature list" representation in that each feature in an attribute-value system may possess a range of values (e.g., feature    P  1     subscript  P  1    P_{1}   below, which has domain of {0,1,2}), rather than simply being present or absent .
