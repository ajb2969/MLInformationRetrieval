Fibered manifold

In differential geometry, in the category of differentiable manifolds, a fibered manifold is a surjective submersion1



i.e. a surjective differentiable mapping such that at each point 
 
 
 
  the tangent mapping



is surjective, or, equivalently, its rank equals dim 
 
 
 
 .
History
In topology, the words fiber (Faser in German) and fiber space (gefaserter Raum) appeared for the first time in a paper by Seifert in 1932,2 but his definitions are limited to a very special case. The main difference from the present day conception of a fiber space, however, was that for Seifert what is now called the base space (topological space) of a fiber (topological) space E was not part of the structure, but derived from it as a quotient space of E. The first definition of fiber space is given by Hassler Whitney in 1935 3 under the name sphere space, but in 1940 Whitney changed the name to sphere bundle.4
The theory of fibered spaces, of which vector bundles, principal bundles, topological fibrations and fibered manifolds are a special case, is attributed to Seifert, Hopf, Feldbau,5 Whitney, Steenrod, Ehresmann,678 Serre,9 and others.
Formal definition
A triple 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are differentiable manifolds and 
 
 
 
  is a surjective submersion, is called a fibered manifold.10 E is called the total space, B is called the base.
Examples

Every differentiable fiber bundle is a fibered manifold.
Every differentiable covering space is a fibered manifold with discrete fiber.
In general, a fibered manifold needs not to be a fiber bundle: different fibers may have different topologies. An example of this phenomenon may be constructed by taking the trivial bundle  and deleting two points in to two different fibers over the base manifold .The result is a new fibered manifold where all the fibers except two are connected.

Properties
Any surjective submersion 
 
 
 
  is open: for each open 
 
 
 
 , the set 
 
 
 
  is open in 
 
 
 
 .
Each fiber  is a closed embedded submanifold of 
 
 
 
  of dimension 
 
 
 
 .11
A fibered manifold admits local sections: For each 
 
 
 
  there is an open neighborhood 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and a smooth mapping 
 
 
 
  with  and 
 
 
 
 .
Fibered coordinates
Let 
 
 
 
  (resp. 
 
 
 
 ) be an 
 
 
 
 -dimensional (resp. 
 
 
 
 -dimensional) manifold. A fibered manifold

 
  admits fiber charts. We say that a chart

 
  on 
 
 
 
  is a fiber chart, or is adapted to the surjective submersion 
 
 
 
  if there exists a chart 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and



where



The above fiber chart condition may be equivalently expressed by



where



is the first projection. The chart 
 
 
 
  is then obviously unique. In view of the above property, the coordinates of a fiber chart 
 
 
 
  are usually denoted by  (xi, yσ)}} where , , 
 
 
 
  the coordinates of the corresponding chart

 
  on 
 
 
 
  are then denoted, with the obvious convention, by  where .
