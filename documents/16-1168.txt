Grouped Dirichlet distribution

In statistics, the grouped Dirichlet distribution (GDD) is a multivariate generalization of the Dirichlet distribution It was first described by Ng et al 2008.1 The Grouped Dirichlet distribution arises in the analysis of categorical data where some observations could fall into any of a set of other 'crisp' category. For example, one may have a data set consisting of cases and controls under two different conditions. With complete data, the cross-classification of disease status forms a 2(case/control)-x-(condition/no-condition) table with cell probabilities





Treatment

No Treatment



Controls

θ1

θ2



Cases

θ3

θ4



If, however, the data includes, say, non-respondents which are known to be controls or cases, then the cross-classification of disease status forms a 2-x-3 table. The probability of the last column is the sum of the probabilities of the first two columns in each row, e.g.





Treatment

No Treatment

Missing



Controls

θ1

θ2

θ1+θ2



Cases

θ3

θ4

θ3+θ4



The GDD allows the full estimation of the cell probabilities under such aggregation conditions.2
Probability Distribution
Consider the closed simplex set 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Writing 
 
 
 
  for the first 
 
 
 
  elements of a member of 
 
 
 
 , the distribution of 
 
 
 
  for two partitions has a density function given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is the multivariate beta function.
Ng et al3 went on to define an m partition grouped Dirichlet distribution with density of 
 
 
 
  given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a vector of integers with $0=s_0.  The normalizing constant given by
 :
The authors went on to use these distributions in the context of three different applications in medical science.
