   Divisor topology      Divisor topology   In mathematics, more specifically general topology , the divisor topology is an example of a topology given to the set X of positive integers that are greater than or equal to two, i.e., }. The divisor topology is the poset topology for the partial order relation of divisibility on the positive integers.  To give the set X a topology means to say which subsets of X are "open", and to do so in a way that the following axioms are met: 1   The union of open sets is an open set.  The finite intersection of open sets is an open set.  The set X and the empty set ∅ are open sets.   Construction  The set X and the empty set ∅ are required to be open sets, and so we define X and ∅ to be open sets in this topology. Denote by Z + the set of positive integers , i.e., the set of positive whole number greater than or equal to one. Read the notation x | n as " x divides n ", and consider the sets       S  n   =   {  x  ∈   ℤ  +   :  x  |  n  }      fragments   subscript  S  n     fragments  normal-{  x    superscript  ℤ    normal-:  x  normal-|  n  normal-}     S_{n}=\{x\in\mathbb{Z}^{+}:x|n\}   Then the set S n is the set of divisors of n . For different values of n , the sets S n are used as a basis for the divisor topology. 2  The open sets in this topology are the lower sets for the partial order defined by  Properties   The set of prime numbers is dense in X . In fact, every dense open set must include every prime, and therefore X is a Baire space . 3  X is a Kolmogorov space that is not T1 . In particular, it is non-Hausdorff .  X is second countable .  X is connected and locally connected .  X is not compact , since the basic open sets S n comprise an infinite covering with no finite subcovering. X is not locally compact .  The closure of a point in x is the set of all multiples of x .   See also   Zariski topology : A topology on the integers whose open sets are the complements of prime ideals .
