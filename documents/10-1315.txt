Pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring)

In enzymology, a pyruvate dehydrogenase (acetyl-transferring) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

pyruvate + [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase] lipoyllysine 
 
 
 
  [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase] S-acetyldihydrolipoyllysine + CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyruvate and [dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase] lipoyllysine, whereas its 3 products are dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase, S-acetyldihydrolipoyllysine, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyruvate:[dihydrolipoyllysine-residue acetyltransferase]-lipoyllysine 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating, acceptor-acetylating). Other names in common use include MtPDC (mitochondrial pyruvate dehydogenase complex), pyruvate decarboxylase, pyruvate dehydrogenase, pyruvate dehydrogenase (lipoamide), pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, pyruvate:lipoamide 2-oxidoreductase (decarboxylating and, acceptor-acetylating), pyruvic acid dehydrogenase, and pyruvic dehydrogenase. This enzyme participates in 5 metabolic pathways: glycolysis / gluconeogenesis, alanine and aspartate metabolism, valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis, pyruvate metabolism, and butanoate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, thiamin diphosphate.
