Lévy–Prokhorov metric

In mathematics, the Lévy–Prokhorov metric (sometimes known just as the Prokhorov metric) is a metric (i.e., a definition of distance) on the collection of probability measures on a given metric space. It is named after the French mathematician Paul Lévy and the Soviet mathematician Yuri Vasilevich Prokhorov; Prokhorov introduced it in 1956 as a generalization of the earlier Lévy metric.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a metric space with its Borel sigma algebra

 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  denote the collection of all probability measures on the measurable space

 
 .
For a subset

 
 , define the ε-neighborhood of 
 
 
 
  by



where 
 
 
 
  is the open ball of radius 
 
 
 
  centered at 
 
 
 
 .
The Lévy–Prokhorov metric

 
  is defined by setting the distance between two probability measures 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to be



For probability measures clearly 
 
 
 
 .
Some authors omit one of the two inequalities or choose only open or closed

 
 ; either inequality implies the other, and 
 
 
 
 , but restricting to open sets may change the metric so defined (if 
 
 
 
  is not Polish).
Properties

If 
 
 
 
  is separable, convergence of measures in the Lévy–Prokhorov metric is equivalent to weak convergence of measures. Thus, 
 
 
 
  is a metrization of the topology of weak convergence.
The metric space 
 
 
 
  is separable if and only if

 
  is separable.
If 
 
 
 
  is complete then 
 
 
 
  is complete. If all the measures in 
 
 
 
  have separable support, then the converse implication also holds: if 
 
 
 
  is complete then 
 
 
 
  is complete.
If 
 
 
 
  is separable and complete, a subset 
 
 
 
  is relatively compact if and only if its 
 
 
 
 -closure is 
 
 
 
 -compact.
