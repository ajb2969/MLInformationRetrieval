   Lévy–Prokhorov metric      Lévy–Prokhorov metric   In mathematics , the Lévy–Prokhorov metric (sometimes known just as the Prokhorov metric ) is a metric (i.e., a definition of distance) on the collection of probability measures on a given metric space . It is named after the French mathematician Paul Lévy and the Soviet mathematician Yuri Vasilevich Prokhorov ; Prokhorov introduced it in 1956 as a generalization of the earlier Lévy metric .  Definition  Let    (  M  ,  d  )     M  d    (M,d)   be a metric space with its Borel sigma algebra     ℬ   (  M  )       ℬ  M    \mathcal{B}(M)   . Let    𝒫   (  M  )       𝒫  M    \mathcal{P}(M)   denote the collection of all probability measures on the measurable space     (  M  ,   ℬ   (  M  )    )     M    ℬ  M     (M,\mathcal{B}(M))   .  For a subset     A  ⊆  M      A  M    A\subseteq M   , define the ε-neighborhood of   A   A   A   by        A  ε   :=   {   p  ∈   M    |     ∃  q   ∈  A   ,    d   (  p  ,  q  )    <  ε    }   =    ⋃   p  ∈  A      B  ε    (  p  )      .       assign   superscript  A  ε    conditional-set    p  M    formulae-sequence      q   A       d   p  q    ε            subscript     p  A       subscript  B  ε   p       A^{\varepsilon}:=\{p\in M~{}|~{}\exists q\in A,\ d(p,q)<\varepsilon\}=\bigcup_%
 {p\in A}B_{\varepsilon}(p).     where     B  ε    (  p  )        subscript  B  ε   p    B_{\varepsilon}(p)   is the open ball of radius   ε   ε   \varepsilon   centered at   p   p   p   .  The Lévy–Prokhorov metric     π  :    𝒫    (  M  )   2    →   [  0  ,   +  ∞   )       normal-:  π   normal-→    𝒫   superscript  M  2     0          \pi:\mathcal{P}(M)^{2}\to[0,+\infty)   is defined by setting the distance between two probability measures   μ   μ   \mu   and   ν   ν   \nu   to be        π   (  μ  ,  ν  )    :=   inf   {   ε  >   0    |    μ   (  A  )    ≤    ν   (   A  ε   )    +    ε    and   ν   (  A  )     ≤    μ   (   A  ε   )    +    ε    for all   A    ∈   ℬ   (  M  )     }     .     assign    π   μ  ν     infimum   conditional-set    ε  0         μ  A       ν   superscript  A  ε      ε  and  ν  A             μ   superscript  A  ε      ε  for all  A           ℬ  M         \pi(\mu,\nu):=\inf\left\{\varepsilon>0~{}|~{}\mu(A)\leq\nu(A^{\varepsilon})+%
 \varepsilon\ \text{and}\ \nu(A)\leq\mu(A^{\varepsilon})+\varepsilon\ \text{for%
  all}\ A\in\mathcal{B}(M)\right\}.     For probability measures clearly     π   (  μ  ,  ν  )    ≤  1        π   μ  ν    1    \pi(\mu,\nu)\leq 1   .  Some authors omit one of the two inequalities or choose only open or closed    A   A   A   ; either inequality implies the other, and      (   A  ¯   )   ε   =   A  ε        superscript   normal-¯  A   ε    superscript  A  ε     (\bar{A})^{\varepsilon}=A^{\varepsilon}   , but restricting to open sets may change the metric so defined (if   M   M   M   is not Polish ).  Properties   If    (  M  ,  d  )     M  d    (M,d)   is separable , convergence of measures in the Lévy–Prokhorov metric is equivalent to weak convergence of measures . Thus,   π   π   \pi   is a metrization of the topology of weak convergence.  The metric space    (   𝒫   (  M  )    ,  π  )       𝒫  M   π    \left(\mathcal{P}(M),\pi\right)   is separable  if and only if     (  M  ,  d  )     M  d    (M,d)   is separable.  If    (   𝒫   (  M  )    ,  π  )       𝒫  M   π    \left(\mathcal{P}(M),\pi\right)   is complete then    (  M  ,  d  )     M  d    (M,d)   is complete. If all the measures in    𝒫   (  M  )       𝒫  M    \mathcal{P}(M)   have separable support , then the converse implication also holds: if    (  M  ,  d  )     M  d    (M,d)   is complete then    (   𝒫   (  M  )    ,  π  )       𝒫  M   π    \left(\mathcal{P}(M),\pi\right)   is complete.  If    (  M  ,  d  )     M  d    (M,d)   is separable and complete, a subset    𝒦  ⊆   𝒫   (  M  )        𝒦    𝒫  M     \mathcal{K}\subseteq\mathcal{P}(M)   is relatively compact if and only if its   π   π   \pi   -closure is   π   π   \pi   -compact.
