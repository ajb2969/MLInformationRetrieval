Wilks's lambda distribution

In statistics, Wilks's lambda distribution (named for Samuel S. Wilks), is a probability distribution used in multivariate hypothesis testing, especially with regard to the likelihood-ratio test and multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA). It is a multivariate generalization of the univariate F-distribution, generalizing the F-distribution in the same way that the Hotelling's T-squared distribution generalizes Student's t-distribution.
Wilks's lambda distribution is related to two independent Wishart distributed variables, and is defined as follows,1
given



independent and with 
 
 




where p is the number of dimensions. In the context of likelihood-ratio tests m is typically the error degrees of freedom, and n is the hypothesis degrees of freedom, so that 
 
 
 
  is the total degrees of freedom.2
The distribution can be related to a product of independent beta-distributed random variables






For large m, Bartlett's approximation3 allows Wilks's lambda to be approximated with a chi-squared distribution
