   Translational partition function      Translational partition function   In statistical mechanics , the translational partition function is that part of the partition function resulting from the movement (translation) of the center of mass . It is derived in the same way as the partition function for the canonical ensemble .  The translational component of the molecular partition function,    q  T     subscript  q  T    q_{T}   , of a molecule in a container may be described by     q  T   =   V   Λ  3    =   V     (   2  π  m  k  T   )    3  2     h  3            subscript  q  T     V   superscript  normal-Λ  3           V     superscript    2  π  m  k  T     3  2     superscript  h  3        q_{T}=\frac{V}{\Lambda^{3}}=V\frac{(2\pi mkT)^{\frac{3}{2}}}{h^{3}}   , where    Λ  =   h    β   2  π  m          normal-Λ    h      β    2  π  m        \Lambda=h\sqrt{\frac{\beta}{2\pi m}}   and    β  =   1   k  T        β    1    k  T      \beta=\frac{1}{kT}   .  Here,   V   V   V   is the volume of the container holding the molecule,   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   is the thermal wavelength,   h   h   h   is the Planck constant ,   m   m   m   is the mass of a molecule,   k   k   k   is the Boltzmann constant and   T   T   T   is the temperature (in Kelvin).
