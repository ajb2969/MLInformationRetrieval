Machining Time

Machining time is the time when a machine is actually processing something. Generally, machining time is the term used when there is a reduction in material or removing some undesirable parts of a material. For example, in a drill press, machining time is when the cutting edge is actually moving forward and making a hole. Machine time is used in other situations, such as when a machine installs screws in a case automatically.
One of the important aspects in manufacturing calculation is how to find and calculate the machining time in a machining operation. Generally, machining is family of processes or operations in which excess material is removed from a starting work piece by a sharp cutting tool so the remaining part has the desired geometry and the required shape. The most common machining operations can be classified into four types: turning, milling, drilling and lathe work.
Steps
Drilling operation
Drilling time (T) can be calculated by the equation:1


where;


 
  is the sum of hole depth approach and over travel distances


 
  is the feed (mm/rev)


 
 
  is the rotational speed (rpm)
