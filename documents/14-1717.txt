Morrey–Campanato space

In mathematics, the Morrey–Campanato spaces (named after Charles B. Morrey, Jr. and Sergio Campanato) 
 
 
 
  are Banach spaces which extend the notion of functions of bounded mean oscillation, describing situations where the oscillation of the function in a ball is proportional to some power of the radius other than the dimension. They are used in the theory of elliptic partial differential equations, since for certain values of 
 
 
 
 , elements of the space 
 
 
 
  are Hölder continuous functions over the domain 
 
 
 
 .
The seminorm of the Morrey spaces is given by


 
  When 
 
 
 
 , the Morrey space is the same as the usual 
 
 
 
  space. When 
 
 
 
 , the spatial dimension, the Morrey space is equivalent to 
 
 
 
 , due to the Lebesgue differentiation theorem. When 
 
 
 
 , the space contains only the 0 function.

  It is known that the Morrey spaces with

When 
 
 
 
 , the Campanato space is the space of functions of bounded mean oscillation. When 
 
 
 
 , the Campanato space is the space of Hölder continuous functions
