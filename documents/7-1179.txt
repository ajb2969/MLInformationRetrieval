Gamma process

A gamma process is a random process with independent gamma distributed increments. Often written as 
 
 
 
 , it is a pure-jump increasing Lévy process with intensity measure 
 
 
 
 , for positive 
 
 
 
 . Thus jumps whose size lies in the interval 
 
 
 
  occur as a Poisson process with intensity 
 
 
 
  The parameter 
 
 
 
  controls the rate of jump arrivals and the scaling parameter 
 
 
 
  inversely controls the jump size. It is assumed that the process starts from a value 0 at t=0.
The gamma process is sometimes also parameterised in terms of the mean (
 
 
 
 ) and variance (
 
 
 
 ) of the increase per unit time, which is equivalent to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
Some basic properties of the gamma process are:

marginal distribution

The marginal distribution of a gamma process at time 
 
 
 
 , is a gamma distribution with mean 
 
 
 
  and variance 
 
 


scaling





adding independent processes





moments



 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Gamma function.

moment generating function





correlation
$\operatorname{Corr}(X_s, X_t) = \sqrt{s/t},\ s, for any gamma process 


The gamma process is used as the distribution for random time change in the variance gamma process.
