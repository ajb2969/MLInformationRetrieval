   Cage (graph theory)      Cage (graph theory)   In the mathematical area of graph theory , a cage is a regular graph that has as few vertices as possible for its girth .  Formally, an ( r , g )-graph is defined to be a graph in which each vertex has exactly r neighbors, and in which the shortest cycle has length exactly g . It is known that an ( r , g )-graph exists for any combination of r ≥ 2 and g ≥ 3. An ( r , g )-cage is an ( r , g )-graph with the fewest possible number of vertices, among all ( r , g )-graphs.  If a Moore graph exists with degree r and girth g , it must be a cage. Moreover, the bounds on the sizes of Moore graphs generalize to cages: any cage with odd girth g must have at least      1  +   r    ∑   i  =  0     (   g  -  3   )   /  2      (   r  -  1   )   i         1    r    superscript   subscript     i  0        g  3   2     superscript    r  1   i       1+r\sum_{i=0}^{(g-3)/2}(r-1)^{i}   vertices, and any cage with even girth g must have at least      2    ∑   i  =  0     (   g  -  2   )   /  2      (   r  -  1   )   i        2    superscript   subscript     i  0        g  2   2     superscript    r  1   i      2\sum_{i=0}^{(g-2)/2}(r-1)^{i}     vertices. Any ( r , g )-graph with exactly this many vertices is by definition a Moore graph and therefore automatically a cage.  There may exist multiple cages for a given combination of r and g . For instance there are three nonisomorphic (3,10)-cages, each with 70 vertices : the Balaban 10-cage , the Harries graph and the Harries-Wong graph . But there is only one (3,11)-cage : the Balaban 11-cage (with 112 vertices).  Known cages  A degree-one graph has no cycle, and a connected degree-two graph has girth equal to its number of vertices, so cages are only of interest for r ≥ 3. The ( r ,3)-cage is a complete graph  K r +1 on r +1 vertices, and the ( r ,4)-cage is a complete bipartite graph  K r , r on 2 r vertices.  Other notable cages include the Moore graphs:   (3,5)-cage: the Petersen graph , 10 vertices  (3,6)-cage: the Heawood graph , 14 vertices  (3,8)-cage: the Tutte–Coxeter graph , 30 vertices  (3,10)-cage: the Balaban 10-cage , 70 vertices  (3,11)-cage: the Balaban 11-cage , 112 vertices  (4,5)-cage: the Robertson graph , 19 vertices  (7,5)-cage: The Hoffman–Singleton graph , 50 vertices.  When r -1 is a prime power, the ( r ,6) cages are the incidence graphs of projective planes .  When r -1 is a prime power, the ( r ,8) and ( r ,12) cages are generalized polygons .   The numbers of vertices in the known ( r , g ) cages, for values of r > 2 and g > 2, other than projective planes and generalized polygons, are:      g:   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12     r = 3:   4   6   10   14   24   30   58   70   112   126     r = 4:   5   8   19   26   67   80      728     r = 5:   6   10   30   42    170      2730     r = 6:   7   12   40   62    312      7812     r = 7:   8   14   50   90             Asymptotics  For large values of g , the Moore bound implies that the number n of vertices must grow at least [[Exponential growth|singly exponentially  as a function of g ]]. Equivalently, g can be at most proportional to the logarithm of n . More precisely,       g  ≤    2    log   r  -  1    n    +   O   (  1  )      .      g      2    subscript     r  1    n      O  1      g\leq 2\log_{r-1}n+O(1).   It is believed that this bound is tight or close to tight . The best known lower bounds on g are also logarithmic, but with a smaller constant factor (implying that n grows singly exponentially but at a higher rate than the Moore bound). Specifically, the Ramanujan graphs satisfy the bound       g  ≥     4  3     log   r  -  1    n    +   O   (  1  )      .      g        4  3     subscript     r  1    n      O  1      g\geq\frac{4}{3}\log_{r-1}n+O(1).   It is unlikely that these graphs are themselves cages, but their existence gives an upper bound to the number of vertices needed in a cage.  References    .   .   .   .   .   .   .   .
