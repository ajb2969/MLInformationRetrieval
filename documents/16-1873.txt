   Eigenoperator      Eigenoperator   In mathematics, an eigenoperator , A , of a matrix  H is a linear operator such that       H  A   =   λ   A          H  A     λ  A     HA=\lambda A\,     where   λ   λ   \lambda   is a corresponding scalar called an eigenvalue . 1  References  "  Category:Mathematics     ↩
