   Orlicz–Pettis theorem      Orlicz–Pettis theorem   In functional analysis , the Orlicz–Pettis theorem is a theorem about convergence in Banach spaces . It is named for Władysław Orlicz and Billy James Pettis . 1 2 The result was originally proven by Orlicz for weakly sequentially complete normed spaces . 3  Orlicz–Pettis Theorem for Banach spaces  Let X be a Banach space and let    {   x  n   }      subscript  x  n     \left\{{{x}_{n}}\right\}   be any sequence in X . If the series     ∑   x  n        subscript  x  n     \sum{{{x}_{n}}}   is weakly subseries convergent , then the series is actually subseries convergent in the norm topology of X .
