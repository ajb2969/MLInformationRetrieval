   UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase      UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase   UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + sulfite   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP-6-sulfoquinovose + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and sulfite , whereas its two products are UDP-6- sulfoquinovose and H 2 O .  In a subsequent reaction catalyzed by sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol synthase, the sulfoquinovose portion of UDP-sulfoquinovose is combined with diacyglycerol to produce the sulfolipid  sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG).  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon-sulfur bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-6-sulfo-6-deoxyglucose sulfohydrolase . Other names in common use include sulfite:UDP-glucose sulfotransferase , and UDP-sulfoquinovose synthase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism and glycerolipid metabolism .  The 3-dimensional structure of the enzyme is known from Protein Data Bank entries 1qrr (Mulichak et al., 1999), 1i24, 1i2b and 1i2c.
