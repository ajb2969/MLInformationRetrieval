Cysteine transaminase

In enzymology, a cysteine transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-cysteine + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  mercaptopyruvate + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-cysteine and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are mercaptopyruvate and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cysteine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. Other names in common use include cysteine aminotransferase, L-cysteine aminotransferase, and CGT. This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
