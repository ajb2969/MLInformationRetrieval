Cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarbonyl-CoA hydratase




Cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarbonyl-CoA hydratase

In enzymology, a cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarbonyl-CoA hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

6-hydroxycyclohex-1-enecarbonyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarbonyl-CoA + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-enecarbonyl-CoA, and two products, cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarbonyl-CoA and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-hydroxycyclohex-1-enecarbonyl-CoA (cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarbonyl-CoA-forming). Other names in common use include cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA hydratase, dienoyl-CoA hydratase, and cyclohexa-1,5-dienecarbonyl-CoA hydro-lyase (incorrect). This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation.
