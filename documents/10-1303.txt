L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase




L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a L-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde + NAD(P)+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-2-aminoadipate + NAD(P)H + H+


The 4 substrates of this enzyme are L-2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde, NAD+, NADP+, and H2O, whereas its 4 products are L-2-aminoadipate, NADH, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis and biodegradation.
Nomenclature
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-2-aminoadipate-6-semialdehyde:NAD(P)+ 6-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include:

aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase,
2-aminoadipate semialdehyde dehydrogenase,
alpha-aminoadipate-semialdehyde dehydrogenase,
alpha-aminoadipate reductase,
2-aminoadipic semialdehyde dehydrogenase,
L-alpha-aminoadipate delta-semialdehyde oxidoreductase,
L-alpha-aminoadipate delta-semialdehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase,
L-alpha-aminoadipate delta-semialdehyde:nicotinamide adenine,
and dinucleotide oxidoreductase.
