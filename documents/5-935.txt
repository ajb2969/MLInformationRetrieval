   Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin      Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin   Ivan Mikheevich Pervushin () (January 21, 1827 â€“ June 29, 1900) was a Russian  mathematician of the 2nd half of 19th century.  Pervushin was born in the town of Lysva of the Perm  gubernia to a family of a clergyman . He graduated from Kazan clerical academy in 1852. Upon graduation, Pervushin was required to become a priest; he stayed for some time in Perm, then moved to a remote village of Zamaraevo, some 150 miles from Ekaterinburg , where he lived for 25 years.  The Priest's job provided for Pervushin's life and left him plenty of free time to spend on mathematics . Pervushin was particularly interested in number theory . In 1877 and in the beginning of 1878 he presented two papers to the Russian Academy of Sciences . In these papers, he proved that the 12th and 23rd Fermat numbers are composite:       2   2  12    +  1       superscript  2   superscript  2  12    1    2^{2^{12}}+1   is divisible by      7  *   2  14    +  1   =  114689          7   superscript  2  14    1   114689    7*2^{14}+1=114689     and       2   2  23    +  1       superscript  2   superscript  2  23    1    2^{2^{23}}+1   is divisible by      5  *   2  25    +  1   =  167772161          5   superscript  2  25    1   167772161    5*2^{25}+1=167772161     In 1883 Pervushin demonstrated that the number:       2  61   -  1       superscript  2  61   1    2^{61}-1   = 2305843009213693951  is a Mersenne prime . This number became known as "Pervushin's number", and remained the second largest known prime (after     2  127   -  1       superscript  2  127   1    2^{127}-1   , proved prime by Lucas 7 years earlier) until 1911, when Powers proved that     2  89   -  1       superscript  2  89   1    2^{89}-1   is prime.  From Zamaraevo, Pervushin moved to the nearby town of Shadrinsk in 1883. Here Pervushin published an article that ridiculed the local government. As a punishment, he was exiled to the village of Mehonskoe in 1887.  A contemporary of Pervushin's, writer A.D.Nosilov, who frequently visited Pervushin in Mehonskoe, wrote a paper "Priest-mathematician", which was published in the "New time" magazine on July 6, 1896.  He wrote: "... this is the modest unknown worker of science ... All of his spacious study is filled up with the different mathematical books, ... here are the books of famous mathematicians: Chebyshev , Legendre , Riemann ; not including all modern mathematical publications, which were sent to him by Russian and foreign scientific and mathematical societies. It seemed I was not in a study of the village priest, but in a study of an old mathematics professor ... Besides being a mathematician, he is also a statistician, a meteorologist, and a correspondent".  Pervushin died in Mehonskoe at the age of 73.
