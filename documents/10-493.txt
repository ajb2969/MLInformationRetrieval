   D-malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)      D-malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating)   In enzymology , a D-malate dehydrogenase (decarboxylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-malate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + CO 2 + NADH   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-malate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are pyruvate , CO 2 , and NADH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-malate:NAD + oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include D-malate dehydrogenase , D-malic enzyme , bifunctional L(+)-tartrate dehydrogenase-D(+)-malate (decarboxylating) . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure
