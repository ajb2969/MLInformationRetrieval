   Negative pedal curve      Negative pedal curve   In geometry , a negative pedal curve is a plane curve that can be constructed from another plane curve C and a fixed point P on that curve. For each point X ≠ P on the curve C , the negative pedal curve has a tangent that passes through X and is perpendicular to line XP . Constructing the negative pedal curve is the inverse operation to constructing a pedal curve .  Definition  In the plane, for every point X other than P there is a unique line through X perpendicular to XP . For a given curve in the plane and a given fixed point P , called the pedal point , the negative pedal curve is the envelope of the lines XP for which X lies on the given curve.  Parameterization  For a parametrically defined curve, its negative pedal curve with pedal point (0; 0) is defined as       X   [  x  ,  y  ]    =      (    x  2   -   y  2    )    y  ′    -   2  x  y   x  ′       x   y  ′    -   y   x  ′            X   x  y             superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  y  normal-′      2  x  y   superscript  x  normal-′         x   superscript  y  normal-′      y   superscript  x  normal-′        X[x,y]=\frac{(x^{2}-y^{2})y^{\prime}-2xyx^{\prime}}{xy^{\prime}-yx^{\prime}}          Y   [  x  ,  y  ]    =      (    x  2   -   y  2    )    x  ′    +   2  x  y   y  ′       x   y  ′    -   y   x  ′            Y   x  y             superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  x  normal-′      2  x  y   superscript  y  normal-′         x   superscript  y  normal-′      y   superscript  x  normal-′        Y[x,y]=\frac{(x^{2}-y^{2})x^{\prime}+2xyy^{\prime}}{xy^{\prime}-yx^{\prime}}     Properties  The negative pedal curve of a pedal curve with the same pedal point is the original curve.
