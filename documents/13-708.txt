   Isserlis' theorem      Isserlis' theorem   In probability theory , Isserlis’ theorem or Wick’s theorem is a formula that allows one to compute higher-order moments of the multivariate normal distribution in terms of its covariance matrix. It is named after Leon Isserlis .  This theorem is particularly important in particle physics , where it is known as Wick's theorem after the work of . Other applications include the analysis of portfolio returns, 1 quantum field theory 2 and generation of colored noise. 3  Theorem statement  The Isserlis'theorem  If ( x 1 , …, x 2 n ) is a zero mean multivariate normal random vector, then        E   [    x  1    x  2   ⋯    x   2  n      ]    =    ∑   ∏   E   [    x  i     x  j     ]        ,       normal-E     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x    2  n         product   normal-E     subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j         \displaystyle\operatorname{E}[\,x_{1}x_{2}\cdots x_{2n}\,]=\sum\prod%
 \operatorname{E}[\,x_{i}x_{j}\,],   where the notation ∑ ∏ means summing over all distinct ways of partitioning x 1 , …, x 2 n into pairs. 4 This yields      (   2  n   )   !   /   (    2  n    n  !    )           2  n       superscript  2  n     n      (2n)!/(2^{n}n!)   terms in the sum. For example, for fourth order moments (four variables) there are three terms. For sixth-order moments there are 3 × 5 = 15 terms, and for eighth-order moments there are 3 × 5 × 7 = 105 terms (as you can check in the examples below).  In his original paper, 5  Leon Isserlis proves this theorem by mathematical induction, generalizing the formula for the fourth-order moments, 6 which takes the appearance        E   [    x  1    x  2    x  3     x  4     ]    =     E   [    x  1    x  2    ]     E   [    x  3    x  4    ]     +    E   [    x  1    x  3    ]     E   [    x  2    x  4    ]     +    E   [    x  1    x  4    ]     E   [    x  2    x  3    ]       .       normal-E     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3    subscript  x  4          normal-E     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      normal-E     subscript  x  3    subscript  x  4         normal-E     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  3      normal-E     subscript  x  2    subscript  x  4         normal-E     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  4      normal-E     subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3         \operatorname{E}[\,x_{1}x_{2}x_{3}x_{4}\,]=\operatorname{E}[x_{1}x_{2}]\,%
 \operatorname{E}[x_{3}x_{4}]+\operatorname{E}[x_{1}x_{3}]\,\operatorname{E}[x_%
 {2}x_{4}]+\operatorname{E}[x_{1}x_{4}]\,\operatorname{E}[x_{2}x_{3}].     Another example of Isserlis' theorem is:      E   [    X  1    X  2    X  3    X  4    X  5    X  6    ]      normal-E     subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2    subscript  X  3    subscript  X  4    subscript  X  5    subscript  X  6      \displaystyle{}\operatorname{E}[X_{1}X_{2}X_{3}X_{4}X_{5}X_{6}]     See also   Wick's theorem   References             "  Category:Theory of probability distributions  Category:Normal distribution  Category:Probability theorems     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
