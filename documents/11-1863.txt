List of possible dwarf planets

It is estimated that there may be 200 dwarf planets in the Kuiper belt of the outer Solar System and up to 10,000 in the region beyond.12 The International Astronomical Union (IAU) has accepted four of these: , , , and , as well as  in the inner Solar System. This article lists these and the more likely of the remaining known possibilities.
IAU naming procedures
In 2008, the IAU modified its naming procedures such that objects considered most likely to be dwarf planets receive differing treatment than others. Objects that have an absolute magnitude (H) less than +1 (and hence a minimum diameter of  if the albedo is below 100%3) are overseen by two naming committees, one for minor planets and one for planets. Once named, the objects are declared to be dwarf planets. Makemake and Haumea are the only objects to have proceeded through the naming process as presumed dwarf planets; currently there are no other bodies that meet this criterion. All other bodies are named by the minor-planet naming committee alone, and the IAU has not stated how or if they will be accepted as dwarf planets.
Limiting values

Calculation of the diameter of Ixion depends on the albedo (the fraction of light that it reflects), which is currently unknown.

The qualifying feature of a dwarf planet is that it "has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape".456 Except for Pluto and Ceres, current observations are insufficient for a direct determination as to whether a body meets this definition. However, Michael Brown estimates that an icy body relaxes into hydrostatic equilibrium at a diameter somewhere between 200 and 400 km.7 Thus, all the trans-Neptunian objects (TNOs) listed below are estimated to be at least  in diameter, though not all bodies estimated to be that size are included. The lists are further complicated by bodies such as  that were at first assumed to be large single objects but were later discovered to be smaller binary or triple systems.8  is the only identified dwarf planet in the asteroid belt. 4 Vesta, the second-most-massive asteroid, appears to have a fully differentiated interior and was therefore in equilibrium at some point in its history, but it is not today.9 The third-most massive object, 2 Pallas, has a somewhat irregular surface and is thought to have only a partially differentiated interior. Brown estimates that, because rocky objects are more rigid than icy objects, rocky objects below  in diameter may not be in hydrostatic equilibrium and thus not dwarf planets.10
Last, a dwarf planet may not be the satellite (moon) of another body, even though several of them are larger than the recognized dwarf planets.
Probable per Brown
Mike Brown considers a large number of trans-Neptunian bodies, ranked by estimated size, to be "probably" dwarf planets.11 He did not consider asteroids, stating "In the asteroid belt Ceres, with a diameter of 900 km, is the only object large enough to be round".12
The terms for varying degrees of likelihood he split these into:

Near certainty: diameter estimated/measured to be over . Sufficient confidence to say these must be in hydrostatic equilibrium, even if predominantly rocky.
Highly likely: diameter estimated/measured to be over . The size would have to be "grossly in error" or they would have to be primarily rocky to not be dwarf planets.
Likely: diameter estimated/measured to be over . Uncertainties in measurement mean that some of these will be significantly smaller and thus doubtful.
Probable: diameter estimated/measured to be over . Expected to be dwarf planets, if they are icy, and that figure is correct.
Possible: diameter estimated/measured to be over . Icy moons transition from a round to irregular shape in the 200–400 km range, suggesting that the same figure holds true for KBOs. Thus, some of these objects could be dwarf planets.
Probably not: diameter estimated/measured to be under 200 km. No icy moon under 200 km is round, suggesting that the same is true for KBOs. The estimated size of these objects would have to be in error for them to be dwarf planets.

Probable per Tancredi
In 2010, Gonzalo Tancredi presented a report to the IAU evaluating a list of 46 candidates for dwarf-planet status based on light curve amplitude analysis and the assumption that the object was more than  in diameter. Some diameters are measured, some are best-fit estimates, and others use an assumed albedo of 0.10. Of these, he identified 15 as dwarf planets by his criteria, with another nine being considered possible. To be cautious, he advised the IAU to "officially" accept as dwarf planets the top three: Sedna, Orcus, and Quaoar.13 Although the IAU had anticipated Tancredi's recommendations, as of 2013, they had not responded.

This is a list of trans-Neptunian objects that have estimated diameters at least 300 km, and so may be dwarf planets. The asteroid Ceres is added for comparison.
The default sort is per Brown's size estimate. The IAU-recognised dwarf planets have bold names. Brown's diameter estimates are in red when they are based upon an assumed albedo. Explanations and sources for the measured masses and diameters can be found in the corresponding articles linked in column "Body" of the table.
