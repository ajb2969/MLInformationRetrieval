   Pyridoxine 4-dehydrogenase      Pyridoxine 4-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a pyridoxine 4-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyridoxine + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyridoxal + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pyridoxine and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are pyridoxal , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyridoxine:NADP + 4-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include pyridoxin dehydrogenase , pyridoxol dehydrogenase , and pyridoxine dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
