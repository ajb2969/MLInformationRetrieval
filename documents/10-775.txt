   Homocysteine S-methyltransferase      Homocysteine S-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a homocysteine S-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + L-homocysteine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + L-methionine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and L- homocysteine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and L-methionine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:L-homocysteine S-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include S-adenosylmethionine homocysteine transmethylase , S-methylmethionine homocysteine transmethylase , adenosylmethionine transmethylase , methylmethionine:homocysteine methyltransferase , adenosylmethionine:homocysteine methyltransferase , homocysteine methylase , homocysteine methyltransferase , homocysteine transmethylase , L-homocysteine S-methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:L-homocysteine methyltransferase , S-adenosylmethionine-homocysteine transmethylase , and S-adenosylmethionine:homocysteine methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
