   Hurwitz's theorem (complex analysis)      Hurwitz's theorem (complex analysis)   In mathematics and in particular the field of complex analysis , Hurwitz's theorem is a theorem associating the zeroes of a sequence of holomorphic , compact  locally uniformly convergent functions with that of their corresponding limit. The theorem is named after Adolf Hurwitz .  Theorem statement  Let { f k } be a sequence of holomorphic functions on a connected open set  G that converge uniformly on compact subsets of G to a holomorphic function f . If f has a zero of order m at z 0 then for every small enough ρ > 0 and for sufficiently large k ∈ N (depending on ρ), f k has precisely m zeroes in the disk defined by | z − z 0 | 0 as k → ∞.  Remarks  The theorem does not guarantee that the result will hold for arbitrary disks. Indeed, if one chooses a disk such that f has zeroes on its boundary , the theorem fails. An explicit example is to consider the unit disk  D and the sequence defined by         f  n    (  z  )    =    z  -  1   +   1  n     ,   z  ∈  ℂ      formulae-sequence       subscript  f  n   z       z  1     1  n       z  ℂ     f_{n}(z)=z-1+\frac{1}{n},\qquad z\in\mathbb{C}     which converges uniformly to f ( z ) = z −1. The function f ( z ) contains no zeroes in D ; however, each f n has exactly one zero in the disk corresponding to the real value 1−(1/ n ).  Applications  Hurwitz's theorem is used in the proof of the Riemann Mapping Theorem , 1 and also has the following two corollaries as an immediate consequence:   Let G be a connected, open set and { f n } a sequence of holomorphic functions which converge uniformly on compact subsets of G to a holomorphic function f . If each f n is nonzero everywhere in G , then f is either identically zero or also is nowhere zero.  If { f n } is a sequence of univalent functions on a connected open set G that converge uniformly on compact subsets of G to a holomorphic function f , then either f is univalent or constant. 2   Proof  Let f be an analytic function on an open subset of the complex plane with a zero of order m at z 0 , and suppose that { f n } is a sequence of functions converging uniformly on compact subsets to f . Fix some ρ > 0 such that f ( z ) ≠ 0 in 0 0| ≤ ρ. Choose δ such that | f ( z )| > δ for z on the circle | z − z 0 | = ρ. Since f k ( z ) converges uniformly on the disc we have chosen, we can find N such that | f k ( z )| ≥ δ/2 for every k ≥ N and every z on the circle, ensuring that the quotient f k ′( z )/ f k ( z ) is well defined for all z on the circle | z − z 0 | = ρ. By Morera's theorem we have a uniform convergence:          f  k  ′    (  z  )      f  k    (  z  )     →     f  ′    (  z  )     f   (  z  )      .     normal-→       superscript   subscript  f  k   normal-′   z      subscript  f  k   z         superscript  f  normal-′   z     f  z      \frac{f_{k}^{\prime}(z)}{f_{k}(z)}\to\frac{f^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)}.     Denoting the number of zeros of f k ( z ) in the disk by N k , we may apply the argument principle to find      m  =    1   2  π  i      ∫    |   z  -   z  0    |   =  ρ         f  ′    (  z  )     f   (  z  )      d  z     =    lim   k  →  ∞      1   2  π  i      ∫    |   z  -   z  0    |   =  ρ         f  k  ′    (  z  )      f  k    (  z  )      d  z      =    lim   k  →  ∞     N  k          m      1    2  π  i      subscript         z   subscript  z  0     ρ           superscript  f  normal-′   z     f  z    d  z            subscript    normal-→  k         1    2  π  i      subscript         z   subscript  z  0     ρ           subscript   superscript  f  normal-′   k   z      subscript  f  k   z    d  z             subscript    normal-→  k      subscript  N  k       m=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|z-z_{0}|=\rho}\frac{f^{\prime}(z)}{f(z)}\,dz=\lim_{k%
 \to\infty}\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{|z-z_{0}|=\rho}\frac{f^{\prime}_{k}(z)}{f_{k}(%
 z)}\,dz=\lim_{k\to\infty}N_{k}     In the above step, we were able to interchange the integral and the limit because of the uniform convergence of the integrand. We have shown that N k → m as k → ∞. Since N k are integer valued, N k must equal m for large enough k .  See also   Rouché's theorem   References     John B. Conway . Functions of One Complex Variable I .
