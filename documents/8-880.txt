Expander walk sampling

In the mathematical discipline of graph theory, the expander walk sampling theorem states that sampling vertices in an expander graph by doing a random walk is almost as good as sampling the vertices independently from a uniform distribution. The earliest version of this theorem is due to , and the more general version is typically attributed to .
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be an expander graph with normalized second-largest eigenvalue

 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  denote the number of vertices in 
 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a function on the vertices of 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  denote the mean of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 
 . Then, if we let 
 
 
 
  denote the vertices encountered in a 
 
 
 
 -step random walk on 
 
 
 
  starting at a random vertex 
 
 
 
 , we have the following for all 
 
 
 
 
 :



Here the 
 
 
 
  hides an absolute constant 
 
 
 
 . An identical bound holds in the other direction:



Uses
This theorem is useful in randomness reduction in the study of derandomization. Sampling from an expander walk is an example of a randomness-efficient sampler. Note that the number of bits used in sampling 
 
 
 
 
  independent samples from 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , whereas if we sample from an infinite family of constant-degree expanders this costs only 
 
 
 
 . Such families exist and are efficiently constructible, e.g. the Ramanujan graphs of Lubotzky-Phillips-Sarnak.
