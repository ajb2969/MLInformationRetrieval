   Infinitely near point      Infinitely near point   In algebraic geometry , an infinitely near point of an algebraic surface S is a point on a surface obtained from S by repeatedly blowing up points. Infinitely near points of algebraic surfaces were introduced by . 1  There are some other meanings of "infinitely near point". Infinitely near points can also be defined for higher-dimensional varieties: there are several inequivalent ways to do this, depending on what one is allowed to blow up. Weil gave a definition of infinitely near points of smooth varieties, 2 though these are not the same as infinitely near points in algebraic geometry. In the line of hyperreal numbers , an extension of the real number line, two points are called infinitely near if their difference is infinitesimal .  Definition  When blowing up is applied to a point P on a surface S , the new surface S * contains a whole curve C where P used to be. The points of C have the geometric interpretation as the tangent directions at P to S . They can be called infinitely near to P as way of visualizing them on S , rather than S *. More generally this construction can be iterated by blowing up a point on the new curve C , and so on.  An infinitely near point (of order n ) P n on a surface S 0 is given by a sequence of points P 0 , P 1 ,..., P n on surfaces S 0 , S 1 ,..., S n such that S i is given by blowing up S i –1 at the point P i –1 and P i is a point of the surface S i with image P i –1 .  In particular the points of the surface S are the infinitely near points on S of order 0.  Infinitely near points correspond to 1-dimensional valuations of the function field of S with 0-dimensional center, and in particular correspond to some of the points of the Zariski–Riemann surface . (The 1-dimensional valuations with 1-dimensional center correspond to irreducible curves of S .) It is also possible to iterate the construction infinitely often, producing an infinite sequence P 0 , P 1 ,... of infinitely near points. These infinite sequences correspond to the 0-dimensional valuations of the function field of the surface, which correspond to the "0-dimensional" points of the Zariski–Riemann surface .  Applications  If C and D are distinct irreducible curves on a smooth surface S intersecting at a point p , then the multiplicity of their intersection at p is given by       ∑   x  infinitely near  p      m  x    (  C  )    m  x    (  D  )        subscript     x  infinitely near  p       subscript  m  x   C   subscript  m  x   D     \sum_{x\text{ infinitely near }p}m_{x}(C)m_{x}(D)   where m x ( C ) is the multiplicity of C at x . In general this is larger than m p ( C ) m p ( D ) if C and D have a common tangent line at x so that they also intersect at infinitely near points of order greater than 0, for example if C is the line y =0 and D is the parabola y = x 2 and p =(0,0).  The genus of C is given by       g   (  C  )    =    g   (  N  )    +    ∑   infinitely near points  x       m  x    (    m  x   -  1   )    /  2           g  C       g  N     subscript     infinitely near points  x         subscript  m  x      subscript  m  x   1    2       g(C)=g(N)+\sum_{\text{infinitely near points }x}m_{x}(m_{x}-1)/2   where N is the normalization of C and m x is the multiplicity of the infinitely near point x on C .
