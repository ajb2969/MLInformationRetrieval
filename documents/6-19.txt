Second-order fluid

A second-order fluid is a fluid where the stress tensor is the sum of all tensors that can be formed from the velocity field with up to two derivatives. So that the total stress tensor can be written



where 
 
 
 
  is the strain tensor, 
 
 
 
  is the upper convected derivative of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the lower convected derivative of 
 
 
 
 . The coefficients 
 
 
 
  are functions of the tensor invariants of 
 
 
 
 . An Euler fluid is a zeroth order fluid and a Newtonian fluid is a first order one.
For a steady flow this can be written



where B is the second Rivlin-Ericksen tensor, and 
 
 
 
  is a new constant.
