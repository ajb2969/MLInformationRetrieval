Pell number

In mathematics, the Pell numbers are an infinite sequence of integers, known since ancient times, that comprise the denominators of the closest rational approximations to the square root of 2. This sequence of approximations begins 1/1, 3/2, 7/5, 17/12, and 41/29, so the sequence of Pell numbers begins with 1, 2, 5, 12, and 29. The numerators of the same sequence of approximations are half the companion Pell numbers or Pell-Lucas numbers; these numbers form a second infinite sequence that begins with 2, 6, 14, 34, and 82.
Both the Pell numbers and the companion Pell numbers may be calculated by means of a recurrence relation similar to that for the Fibonacci numbers, and both sequences of numbers grow exponentially, proportionally to powers of the silver ratio 1 + √2. As well as being used to approximate the square root of two, Pell numbers can be used to find square triangular numbers, to construct integer approximations to the right isosceles triangle, and to solve certain combinatorial enumeration problems.1
As with Pell's equation, the name of the Pell numbers stems from Leonhard Euler's mistaken attribution of the equation and the numbers derived from it to John Pell. The Pell-Lucas numbers are also named after Édouard Lucas, who studied sequences defined by recurrences of this type; the Pell and companion Pell numbers are Lucas sequences.
Pell numbers
The Pell numbers are defined by the recurrence relation



In words, the sequence of Pell numbers starts with 0 and 1, and then each Pell number is the sum of twice the previous Pell number and the Pell number before that. The first few terms of the sequence are


, 1, 2, 5, 12, 29, 70, 169, 408, 985, 2378, 5741, 13860, ... .


The Pell numbers can also be expressed by the closed form formula


 
  For large values of n, the 
 
 
 
  term dominates this expression, so the Pell numbers are approximately proportional to powers of the silver ratio

 
 , analogous to the growth rate of Fibonacci numbers as powers of the golden ratio.
A third definition is possible, from the matrix formula



Many identities can be derived or proven from these definitions; for instance an identity analogous to Cassini's identity for Fibonacci numbers,


 
  is an immediate consequence of the matrix formula (found by considering the determinants of the matrices on the left and right sides of the matrix formula).2
Approximation to the square root of two
 Pell numbers arise historically and most notably in the rational approximation to the square root of 2. If two large integers x and y form a solution to the Pell equation


 
  then their ratio 
 
 
 
  provides a close approximation to 
 
 
 
 . The sequence of approximations of this form is


 
  where the denominator of each fraction is a Pell number and the numerator is the sum of a Pell number and its predecessor in the sequence. That is, the solutions have the form 
 
 
 
 . The approximation


 
  of this type was known to Indian mathematicians in the third or fourth century B.C.3 The Greek mathematicians of the fifth century B.C. also knew of this sequence of approximations:4 Plato refers to the numerators as rational diameters.5 In the 2nd century CE Theon of Smyrna used the term the side and diameter numbers to describe the denominators and numerators of this sequence.6
These approximations can be derived from the continued fraction expansion of 
 
 
 
 :


 
  Truncating this expansion to any number of terms produces one of the Pell-number-based approximations in this sequence; for instance,



As Knuth (1994) describes, the fact that Pell numbers approximate 
 
 
 
  allows them to be used for accurate rational approximations to a regular octagon with vertex coordinates 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . All vertices are equally distant from the origin, and form nearly uniform angles around the origin. Alternatively, the points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  form approximate octagons in which the vertices are nearly equally distant from the origin and form uniform angles.
Primes and squares
A Pell prime is a Pell number that is prime. The first few Pell primes are

2, 5, 29, 5741, ... .
 

For these ns are

2, 3, 5, 11, 13, 29, 41, 53, 59, 89, 97, 101, 167, 181, 191, ... 
 

As with the Fibonacci numbers, a Pell number 
 
 
 
  can only be prime if n itself is prime, because if and only if a divides b, then 
 
 
 
  divides 
 
 
 
 .
If and only if a prime p congruent to 1 or 7 (mod 8), then p divides Pp-1, otherwise, p divides Pp+1. (The only exception is p = 2, if and only if p = 2, then p divides Pp)
The only Pell numbers that are squares, cubes, or any higher power of an integer are 0, 1, and 169 = 132.7
However, despite having so few squares or other powers, Pell numbers have a close connection to square triangular numbers.8 Specifically, these numbers arise from the following identity of Pell numbers:


 
  The left side of this identity describes a square number, while the right side describes a triangular number, so the result is a square triangular number.
Santana and Diaz-Barrero (2006) prove another identity relating Pell numbers to squares and showing that the sum of the Pell numbers up to 
 
 
 
  is always a square:


 
  For instance, the sum of the Pell numbers up to 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , is the square of 
 
 
 
 . The numbers 
 
 
 
  forming the square roots of these sums,

1, 7, 41, 239, 1393, 8119, 47321, ... ,
 

are known as the Newman–Shanks–Williams (NSW) numbers.
Pythagorean triples
 If a right triangle has integer side lengths a, b, c (necessarily satisfying the Pythagorean theorem a2+b2=c2), then (a,b,c) is known as a Pythagorean triple. As Martin (1875) describes, the Pell numbers can be used to form Pythagorean triples in which a and b are one unit apart, corresponding to right triangles that are nearly isosceles. Each such triple has the form


 
  The sequence of Pythagorean triples formed in this way is

(4,3,5), (20,21,29), (120,119,169), (696,697,985), ....
 

Pell-Lucas numbers
The companion Pell numbers or Pell-Lucas numbers are defined by the recurrence relation



In words: the first two numbers in the sequence are both 2, and each successive number is formed by adding twice the previous Pell-Lucas number to the Pell-Lucas number before that, or equivalently, by adding the next Pell number to the previous Pell number: thus, 82 is the companion to 29, and 82 = 2 * 34 + 14 = 70 + 12. The first few terms of the sequence are : 2, 2, 6, 14, 34, 82, 198, 478...
Like the Fibonacci number to Lucas number, 
 
 
 
  for all natural number n.
The companion Pell numbers can be expressed by the closed form formula



These numbers are all even; each such number is twice the numerator in one of the rational approximations to 
 
 
 
  discussed above.
Like the Lucas sequence, if a Pell-Lucas number 
 
 
 
  is prime, it is necessary that n be either prime or a power of 2. The Pell-Lucas primes are

3, 7, 17, 41, 239, 577, ... .
 

For these ns are

2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 16, 19, 29, 47, 59, 163, 257, 421, ... .

Definitions
The half companion Pell Numbers 
 
 
 
  and the Pell numbers 
 
 
 
  can be derived in a number of easily equivalent ways:
Raising to powers:






From this it follows that there are closed forms:


 
  and



Paired recurrences:






and matrix formulations:



So



Approximations
The difference between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  which goes rapidly to zero. So 
 
 
 
  is extremely close 
 
 
 
 .
From this last observation it follows that the integer ratios 
 
 
 
  rapidly approach 
 
 
 
  while 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  rapidly approach 
 
 
 
 .
=== H2 − 2P2 = ±1 ===
Since 
 
 
 
  is irrational, we can't have 
 
 
 
  i.e. 
 
 
 
 . The best we can achieve is either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
The (non-negative) solutions to 
 
 
 
  are exactly the pairs 
 
 
 
  even and the solutions to 
 
 
 
  are exactly the pairs 
 
 
 
  odd. To see this, note first that


 
  so that these differences, starting with 
 
 
 
  are alternately 
 
 
 
 . Then note that every positive solution comes in this way from a solution with smaller integers since 
 
 
 
 . The smaller solution also has positive integers with the one exception 
 
 
 
  which comes from 
 
 
 
 .
Square triangular numbers
The required equation 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to 
 
 
 
  which becomes 
 
 
 
  with the substitutions 
 
 
 
 . Hence the nth solution is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Observe that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively prime so that 
 
 
 
  happens exactly when they are adjacent integers, one a square 
 
 
 
  and the other twice a square 
 
 
 
 . Since we know all solutions of that equation, we also have


 
  and 
 
 

This alternate expression is seen in the next table.
