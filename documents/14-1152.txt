Kosmann lift




Kosmann lift

In differential geometry, the Kosmann lift,123 named after Yvette Kosmann-Schwarzbach, of a vector field 
 
 
 
  on a Riemannian manifold

 
  is the canonical projection 
 
 
 
  on the orthonormal frame bundle of its natural lift 
 
 
 
  defined on the bundle of linear frames.4
Generalisations exist for any given reductive G-structure.
Introduction
In general, given a subbundle

 
  of a fiber bundle

 
  over 
 
 
 
  and a vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , its restriction 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is a vector field "along" 
 
 
 
  not on (i.e., tangent to) 
 
 
 
 . If one denotes by 
 
 
 
  the canonical embedding, then 
 
 
 
  is a section of the pullback bundle

 
 , where


 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the tangent bundle of the fiber bundle 
 
 
 
 . Let us assume that we are given a ' Kosmann decomposition' of the pullback bundle 
 
 
 
 , such that


 
  i.e., at each 
 
 
 
  one has 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a vector subspace of 
 
 
 
  and we assume 
 
 
 
  to be a vector bundle over 
 
 
 
 , called the transversal bundle of the ' Kosmann decomposition'. It follows that the restriction 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  splits into a tangent vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and a transverse vector field 
 
 
 
  being a section of the vector bundle 
 
 

Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be the oriented orthonormal frame bundle of an oriented 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Riemannian manifold 
 
 
 
  with given metric 
 
 
 
 . This is a principal 
 
 
 
 -subbundle of 
 
 
 
 , the tangent frame bundle of linear frames over 
 
 
 
  with structure group 
 
 
 
 . By definition, one may say that we are given with a classical reductive 
 
 
 
 -structure. The special orthogonal group 
 
 
 
  is a reductive Lie subgroup of 
 
 
 
 . In fact, there exists a direct sum decomposition 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Lie algebra of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the Lie algebra of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -invariant vector subspace of symmetric matrices, i.e. 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 

Let 
 
 
 
  be the canonical embedding.
One then can prove that there exists a canonical Kosmann decomposition of the pullback bundle

 
  such that



i.e., at each 
 
 
 
  one has 
 
 

 
  being the fiber over 
 
 
 
  of the subbundle

 
  of 
 
 
 
 . Here, 
 
 
 
  is the vertical subbundle of 
 
 
 
  and at each 
 
 
 
  the fiber 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the vector space of symmetric matrices 
 
 
 
 .
From the above canonical and equivariant decomposition, it follows that the restriction 
 
 
 
  of an 
 
 
 
 -invariant vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  splits into a 
 
 
 
 -invariant vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , called the Kosmann vector field associated with

 
 , and a transverse vector field 
 
 
 
 .
In particular, for a generic vector field

 
  on the base manifold 
 
 
 
 , it follows that the restriction 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  of its natural lift 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
  splits into a 
 
 
 
 -invariant vector field 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , called the Kosmann lift of 
 
 
 
 , and a transverse vector field 
 
 
 
 .
