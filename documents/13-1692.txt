   Unimolecular ion decomposition      Unimolecular ion decomposition   Unimolecular ion decomposition is the fragmentation of a gas phase ion in a reaction with a molecularity of one. 1 Ions with sufficient internal energy may fragment in a mass spectrometer , which in some cases may degrade the mass spectrometer performance, but in other cases, such as tandem mass spectrometry , the fragmentation can reveal information about the structure of the ion.  Wahrhaftig diagram  A Wahrhaftig diagram (named after Austin L. Wahrhaftig ) illustrates the relative contributions in unimolecular ion decomposition of direct fragmentation and fragmentation following rearrangement. The x-axis of the digram represents the internal energy of the ion. The lower part of the diagram shows the logarithm of the rate constant  k for unimolecular dissociation whereas the upper portion of the diagram indicates the probability of forming a particular product ion. The green trace in the lower part of the diagram indicates the rate of the rearrangement reacton given by       A  B  C   D  +    →    A   D  +    +   B   C        normal-→    A  B  C   superscript  D         A   superscript  D       B  C      ABCD^{+}\to AD^{+}+BC\,     and the blue trace indicates the direct cleavage reaction       A  B  C   D  +    →    A   B  +    +   C   D        normal-→    A  B  C   superscript  D         A   superscript  B       C  D      ABCD^{+}\to AB^{+}+CD\,     A rate constant of 10 6 s −1 is sufficiently fast for ion decomposition within the ion source of a typical mass spectrometer. Ions with rate constants less than 10 6 s −1 and greater than approximately 10 5 s −1 (lifetimes between 10 -5 and 10 -6 s) have a high probability of decomposing in the mass spectrometer between the ion source and the detector. These rate constants are indicated in the Wahrhaftig diagram by the log k = 5 and log k = 6 dashed lines.  Indicated on the rate constant plot are the reaction critical energy (also called the activation energy ) for the formation of AD + , E 0 (AD + ) and AB + , E 0 (AB + ). These represent the minimum internal energy of ABCD + required to form the respective product ions: the difference in the zero point energy of ABCD + and that of the activated complex .  When the internal energy of ABCD + is greater than E m (AD + ), the ions are metastable (indicated by m * ); this occurs near log k > 5. A metastable ion has sufficient internal energy to dissociate prior to detection. 2 3 The energy E s (AD + ) is defined as the internal energy of ABCD + that results in an equal probability that ABCD + and AD + leave the ion source, which occurs at near log k = 6. When the precursor ion has an internal energy equal to E s (AB + ), the rates of formation of AD + and AB + are equal.  Thermodynamic and kinetic effects  (Figure)  400 px|Schematic of "tight" and "loose" transition state complexes for a hypothetical ion ABCD + .   Like all chemical reactions, the unimolecular decomposition of ions is subject to thermodynamic versus kinetic reaction control : the kinetic product forms faster, whereas the thermodynamic product is more stable. 4 In the decomposition of ABCD + , the reaction to form AD + is thermodynamically favored and the reaction to form AB + is kinetically favored. This is because the AD + reaction has favorable enthalpy and the AB + has favorable entropy .  In the reaction depicted schematically in the figure, the rearrangement reaction forms a double bond B=C and a new single bond A-D, which offsets the cleavage of the A-B and C-D bonds. The formation of AB + requires bond cleavage without the offsetting bond formation. However, the steric effect makes it more difficult for the molecule to achieve the rearrangement transition state and form AD + . The activated complex with strict steric requirements is referred to as a "tight complex" whereas the transition state without such requirements is called a "loose complex."
