Pyrrole-2-carboxylate monooxygenase

Pyrrole-2-carboxylate monooxygenase (, pyrrole-2-carboxylate oxygenase) is an enzyme with system name pyrrole-2-carboxylate,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase (5-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

pyrrole-2-carboxylate + NADH + H+ + O2

 
  5-hydroxypyrrole-2-carboxylate + NAD+ + H2O
 

Pyrrole-2-carboxylate monooxygenase is a flavoprotein (FAD).
