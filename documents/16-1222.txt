   Nowcast (Air Quality Index)      Nowcast (Air Quality Index)   The NowCast is a weighted average of hourly air monitoring data used by the United States Environmental Protection Agency for real-time reporting of the Air Quality Index (AQI) for PM (PM 10 or PM 2.5 ) data.  The NowCast is computed from the most recent 12 hours of PM monitoring data, but the NowCast weights the most recent hours of data more heavily than an ordinary 12-hour average when pollutant levels are changing. The NowCast is used in lieu of a 24-hour average PM concentration in the calculation of the AQI until an entire calendar day of hourly concentrations has been monitored. 1 2 3 4  Calculation of the NowCast  Let c 1 ,c 2 ,...c 12 represent the hourly PM concentrations for the most recent 12-hour period, with c 1 the most recent hourly value, and let c min and c max represent the minimum and maximum hourly concentration for the 12-hour period. Define:       w  *   =    c   m  i  n     c   m  a  x          superscript  w       subscript  c    m  i  n     subscript  c    m  a  x       w^{*}=\frac{c_{min}}{c_{max}}   and let      w  =   {      w  *        if   w  *    >    1  2     ,         1  2         if   w  *    ≤    1  2     .           w   cases   superscript  w        if   superscript  w       1  2      1  2       if   superscript  w       1  2       w=\begin{cases}w^{*}&\mbox{if }w^{*}>\frac{1}{2},\\
 \frac{1}{2}&\mbox{if }w^{*}\leq\frac{1}{2}.\\
 \end{cases}     With these definitions the NowCast 5 is given by:        N  o  w  C  a  s  t   =     ∑   i  =  1   12     w   i  -  1     c  i       ∑   i  =  1   12    w   i  -  1       .        N  o  w  C  a  s  t       superscript   subscript     i  1    12      superscript  w    i  1     subscript  c  i       superscript   subscript     i  1    12    superscript  w    i  1        NowCast=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{12}w^{i-1}c_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{12}w^{i-1}}.   For the special case where there is no variability in the hourly values, c min = c max , w = 1, and the NowCast reduces to the twelve-hour average:        N  o  w  C  a  s  t   =     ∑   i  =  1   12    c  i    12    .        N  o  w  C  a  s  t       superscript   subscript     i  1    12    subscript  c  i    12     NowCast=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{12}c_{i}}{12}.     For the special case where w=1/2:       N  o  w  C  a  s  t   =     c  1   +    (   1  2   )    c  2    +  …  +     (     1   2   )   11    c  12      1  +   1  2   +    (   1  2   )   2   +  …  +    (   1  2   )   11           N  o  w  C  a  s  t        subscript  c  1       1  2    subscript  c  2    normal-…     superscript      absent  1   2   11    subscript  c  12       1    1  2    superscript    1  2   2   normal-…   superscript    1  2   11       NowCast=\frac{c_{1}+({\frac{1}{2}})c_{2}+...+{(\frac{\par
 }{1}{2}})^{11}{c_{12%
 }}}{1+\frac{1}{2}+({\frac{1}{2}})^{2}+...+{(\frac{1}{2}})^{11}}     But 1/(1-x)=1 + x + x 2 + ... , x NowCast = \frac{1}{2}c_1+({\frac{1}{2}})^2 c_2+...+{(\frac  {1}{2}})^{12}{c_{12}}  Because the most recent hours of data are weighted so heavily in the NowCast when PM levels are changing, EPA does not report the NowCast when data is missing for c 1 or c 2 .  Example  Consider a day when the hourly average PM 2.5 concentration is zero for all hours of the day, except for a single hour from noon to 1 pm, where a monitor records a concentration pulse of 71 micrograms per cubic meter (µg/m 3 ). According to the equation above, the Nowcast is 71/2 µg/m 3 =35.5 µg/m 3 the hour after the pulse, two hours later it is 71/4 µg/m 3 =17.8 µg/m 3 and three hours later it is 71/8 µg/m 3 = 8.9 µg/m 3 . To calculate the corresponding AQI values, each NowCast concentration is substituted into the AQI equation in place of the 24-hour average PM 2.5 concentration:      I  =       I   h  i  g  h    -   I   l  o  w       C   h  i  g  h    -   C   l  o  w       (   C  -   C   l  o  w     )    +   I   l  o  w         I           subscript  I    h  i  g  h     subscript  I    l  o  w        subscript  C    h  i  g  h     subscript  C    l  o  w        C   subscript  C    l  o  w       subscript  I    l  o  w       I=\frac{I_{high}-I_{low}}{C_{high}-C_{low}}(C-C_{low})+I_{low}     where:     I   I   I   = the AQI,     C   C   C   = the 24-hour average PM 2.5 pollutant concentration,      C   l  o  w      subscript  C    l  o  w     C_{low}   = the concentration breakpoint that is ≤   C   C   C   ,      C   h  i  g  h      subscript  C    h  i  g  h     C_{high}   = the concentration breakpoint that is ≥   C   C   C   ,      I   l  o  w      subscript  I    l  o  w     I_{low}   = the index breakpoint corresponding to    C   l  o  w      subscript  C    l  o  w     C_{low}   ,      I   h  i  g  h      subscript  I    h  i  g  h     I_{high}   = the index breakpoint corresponding to    C   h  i  g  h      subscript  C    h  i  g  h     C_{high}   .  and:          C   l  o  w      subscript  C    l  o  w     C_{low}          C   h  i  g  h      subscript  C    h  i  g  h     C_{high}          I   l  o  w      subscript  I    l  o  w     I_{low}          I   h  i  g  h      subscript  I    h  i  g  h     I_{high}      Category     0   12.0   0   50   Good     12.1   35.4   51   100   Moderate     35.5   55.4   101   150   Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups     55.5   150.4   151   200   Unhealthy     150.5   250.4   201   300   Very Unhealthy     250.5   350.4   301   400   Hazardous     350.5   500.4   401   500   Hazardous     Thus, the three Nowcast concentrations correspond to air quality indices 6 of 101, (AQI Color Code Orange, Air Quality: Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups), 63 (AQI Color Code Yellow, Air Quality: Moderate ), and 37 (AQI Color Code Green, Air Quality: Good) respectively. After the day is over and all of the hourly data is available, the AQI for the day is calculated from the 24-hr average; 71/24 µg/m 3 = 3.0 µg/m 3 , an AQI of 12 (Color Code Green, Air Quality: Good).
