   Hsu–Robbins–Erdős theorem      Hsu–Robbins–Erdős theorem   In the mathematical  theory of probability , the Hsu–Robbins–Erdős theorem states that if     X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n       subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n     X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}   is a sequence of i.i.d. random variables with zero mean and finite variance and        S  n   =    X  1   +  ⋯  +   X  n     ,       subscript  S  n      subscript  X  1   normal-⋯   subscript  X  n      S_{n}=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n},\,     then       ∑   n  ⩾  1    P   (  |   S  n   |  >  ε  n  )   <  ∞     fragments   subscript     n  1    P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|   subscript  S  n   normal-|   ε  n  normal-)       \sum\limits_{n\geqslant 1}P(|S_{n}|>\varepsilon n)<\infty     for every    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   .  The result was proved by Pao-Lu Hsu and Herbert Robbins in 1947.  This is an interesting strengthening of the classical strong law of large numbers in the direction of the Borel–Cantelli lemma . The idea of such a result is probably due to Robbins, but the method of proof is vintage Hsu. 1 Hsu and Robbins further conjectured in 2 that the condition of finiteness of the variance of   X   X   X   is also a necessary condition for     ∑   n  ⩾  1    P   (  |   S  n   |  >  ε  n  )   <  ∞     fragments   subscript     n  1    P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|   subscript  S  n   normal-|   ε  n  normal-)       \sum\limits_{n\geqslant 1}P(|S_{n}|>\varepsilon n)<\infty   to hold. Two years later, the famed mathematician Paul Erdős proved the conjecture. 3  Since then, many authors extended this result in several directions. 4  References  "  Category:Theorems in measure theory  Category:Probabilistic inequalities     Chung, K.
