   1999 OJ4      1999 OJ4   1999 OJ 4 is a fairly small cubewano that orbits in a nearly circular orbit. It is orbited by S/2005 (1999 OJ 4 ) 1, a moon just 3 kilometres smaller than 1999 OJ 4 itself. 1  Orbit and Relationship with the Kuiper Belt  1999 OJ 4 orbit characterizes it as a classical Kuiper Belt object, or cubewano. Due to its nearly circular orbit and low inclination, it is also in the "cold" population of cubewanos. As a result, it is likely reddish in color. 2 3  Moon  1999 OJ 4 has one moon, S/2005 (1999 OJ 4 ) 1. This moon was discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope 4 on October 5, 2013. 5 It orbits 3,267 kilometres away from 1999 OJ 4 , completing one orbit every 84.115 days. 6 7 At 72 km, it is nearly the same size as 1999 OJ 4 . From the surface of 1999 OJ 4 , S/2005 (1999 OJ 4 ) 1 would have an apparent diameter of roughly 8.11°, 8 over fourteen times the apparent size of the Sun from Earth .
