   Non-autonomous mechanics      Non-autonomous mechanics   Non-autonomous mechanics describe non-relativistic mechanical systems subject to time-dependent transformations. In particular, this is the case of mechanical systems whose Lagrangians and Hamiltonians depend on the time. The configuration space of non-autonomous mechanics is a fiber bundle     Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   over the time axis   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   coordinated by    (  t  ,   q  i   )     t   superscript  q  i     (t,q^{i})   .  This bundle is trivial, but its different trivializations    Q  =   ℝ  ×  M       Q    ℝ  M     Q=\mathbb{R}\times M   correspond to the choice of different non-relativistic reference frames. Such a reference frame also is represented by a connection    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   on    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   which takes a form     Γ  i   =  0       superscript  normal-Γ  i   0    \Gamma^{i}=0   with respect to this trivialization. The corresponding covariant differential     (    q  t  i   -   Γ  i    )    ∂  i          subscript   superscript  q  i   t    superscript  normal-Γ  i     subscript   i     (q^{i}_{t}-\Gamma^{i})\partial_{i}   determines the relative velocity with respect to a reference frame   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   .  As a consequence, non-autonomous mechanics (in particular, non-autonomous Hamiltonian mechanics) can be formulated as a covariant classical field theory (in particular covariant Hamiltonian field theory ) on    X  =  ℝ      X  ℝ    X=\mathbb{R}   . Accordingly, the velocity phase space of non-autonomous mechanics is the jet manifold      J  1   Q       superscript  J  1   Q    J^{1}Q   of    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   provided with the coordinates    (  t  ,   q  i   ,   q  t  i   )     t   superscript  q  i    subscript   superscript  q  i   t     (t,q^{i},q^{i}_{t})   . Its momentum phase space is the vertical cotangent bundle    V  Q      V  Q    VQ   of    Q  →  ℝ     normal-→  Q  ℝ    Q\to\mathbb{R}   coordinated by    (  t  ,   q  i   ,   p  i   )     t   superscript  q  i    subscript  p  i     (t,q^{i},p_{i})   and endowed with the canonical Poisson structure . The dynamics of Hamiltonian non-autonomous mechanics is defined by a Hamiltonian form      p  i   d   q  i    -   H   (  t  ,   q  i   ,   p  i   )   d  t          subscript  p  i   d   superscript  q  i      H   t   superscript  q  i    subscript  p  i    d  t     p_{i}dq^{i}-H(t,q^{i},p_{i})dt   .  One can associate to any Hamiltonian non-autonomous system an equivalent Hamiltonian autonomous system on the cotangent bundle    T  Q      T  Q    TQ   of   Q   Q   Q   coordinated by    (  t  ,   q  i   ,  p  ,   p  i   )     t   superscript  q  i   p   subscript  p  i     (t,q^{i},p,p_{i})   and provided with the canonical symplectic form ; its Hamiltonian is    p  -  H      p  H    p-H   .
