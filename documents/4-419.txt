   Linear temporal logic      Linear temporal logic   In logic , linear temporal logic or linear-time temporal logic 1 2 ( LTL ) is a modal  temporal logic with modalities referring to time. In LTL, one can encode formulae about the future of paths , e.g., a condition will eventually be true, a condition will be true until another fact becomes true, etc. It is a fragment of the more complex CTL* , which additionally allows branching time and quantifiers. Subsequently LTL is sometimes called propositional temporal logic , abbreviated PTL . 3 Linear temporal logic (LTL) is a fragment of S1S.  LTL was first proposed for the formal verification of computer programs by Amir Pnueli in 1977. 4  Syntax  LTL is built up from a finite set of propositional variables  AP , the logical operators ¬ and ∨, and the temporal  modal operators  X (some literature uses O or N ) and U . Formally, the set of LTL formulas over AP is inductively defined as follows:   if p ∈ AP then p is an LTL formula;  if ψ and φ are LTL formulas then ¬ψ, φ ∨ ψ, X ψ, and φ U ψ are LTL formulas. 5   X is read as ne x t and U is read as u ntil. Other than these fundamental operators, there are additional logical and temporal operators defined in terms of the fundamental operators to write LTL formulas succinctly. The additional logical operators are ∧, →, ↔, true , and false . Following are the additional temporal operators.   G for always ( g lobally)  F for eventually (in the f uture)  R for r elease  W for w eakly until   Semantics  An LTL formula can be satisfied by an infinite sequence of truth evaluations of variables in AP . These sequences can be viewed as a word on a path of a Kripke structure (an ω-word over alphabet 2 AP ). Let w = a 0 ,a 1 ,a 2 ,... be such an ω-word. Let w (i) = a i . Let w i = a i ,a i+1 ,..., which is a suffix of w . Formally, the satisfaction relation   ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   between a word and an LTL formula is defined as follows:   w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   p if p ∈ w (0)  w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   ¬ψ if w    ⊭   normal-⊭   \nvDash   ψ  w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   φ ∨ ψ if w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   φ or w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   ψ  w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash    X ψ if w 1    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   ψ (in the ne x t time step ψ must be true)  w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   φ U ψ if there exists i ≥ 0 such that w i    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   ψ and for all 0 ≤ k k   ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   φ (φ must remain true u ntil ψ becomes true)   We say an ω-word w satisfies LTL formula ψ when w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   ψ. The ω-language  L (ψ) defined by ψ is { w | w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   ψ}, which is the set of ω-words that satisfy ψ. A formula ψ is satisfiable if there exist a ω-word w such that w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   ψ. A formula ψ is valid if for each ω-word w over alphabet 2 AP , w    ⊨   normal-⊨   \vDash   ψ.  The additional logical operators are defined as follows:   φ ∧ ψ ≡ ¬(¬φ ∨ ¬ψ)  φ → ψ ≡ ¬φ ∨ ψ  φ ↔ ψ ≡ (φ → ψ) ∧ ( ψ → φ)  true ≡ p ∨ ¬p, where p ∈ AP  false ≡ ¬ true   The additional temporal operators R , F , and G are defined as follows:   φ R ψ ≡ ¬(¬φ U ¬ψ) ( ψ remains true until once φ becomes true. φ may never become true)  F ψ ≡ true  U ψ (eventually ψ becomes true)  G ψ ≡ false  R ψ ≡ ¬ F ¬ψ (ψ always remains true)    Weak until   Some authors also define a weak until binary operator, denoted W , with semantics similar to that of the until operator but the stop condition is not required to occur (similar to release). 6 It is sometimes useful since both U and R can be defined in terms of the weak until:   φ W ψ ≡ (φ U ψ) ∨ G φ ≡ φ U (ψ ∨ G φ) ≡ ψ R (ψ ∨ φ)  φ U ψ ≡ F ψ ∧ (φ W ψ)  φ R ψ ≡ ψ W (ψ ∧ φ)   The semantics for the temporal operators are pictorially presented as follows.

Equivalences  Let Φ, ψ, and ρ be LTL formulas. The following tables list some of the useful equivalences which extend standard equivalences among the usual logical operators.      Distributivity       X (Φ ∨ ψ) ≡ ( X Φ) ∨ ( X ψ)     F (Φ ∨ ψ) ≡ ( F Φ) ∨ ( F ψ)     ρ U (Φ ∨ ψ) ≡ (ρ U Φ) ∨ (ρ U ψ)         Negation propagation       ¬ X Φ ≡ X ¬Φ     ¬ (Φ U ψ) ≡ (¬Φ R ¬ψ)         Special Temporal properties       F Φ ≡ F  F Φ     Φ U ψ ≡ ψ ∨ ( Φ ∧ X (Φ U ψ) )     G Φ ≡ Φ ∧ X ( G Φ)     Negation normal form  All the formulas of LTL can be transformed into negation normal form , where   all negations appear only in front of the atomic propositions,  only other logical operators true , false , ∧, and ∨ can appear, and  only the temporal operators X , U , and R can appear.   Using the above equivalences for negation propagation, it is possible to derive the normal form. This normal form allows R , true , false , and ∧ to appear in the formula, which are not fundamental operators of LTL. Note that the transformation to the negation normal form does not blow up the size of the formula. This normal form is useful in translation from LTL to Büchi automaton .  Relations with other logics  LTL can be shown to be equivalent to the monadic first-order logic of order , FO[ or equivalently star-free languages . 7  Computation tree logic (CTL) and Linear temporal logic (LTL) are both a subset of CTL* , but are not equivalent to each other. For example,   No formula in CTL can define the language that is defined by the LTL formula F ( G p).  No formula in LTL can define the language that is defined by the CTL formulas AG ( p → ( EX q ∧ EX ¬q) ) or AG ( EF (P)).   However, a subset of CTL* exists that is a proper subset of both CTL and LTL.  Applications   Automata theoretic Linear temporal logic model checking  An important way to model check is to express desired properties (such as the ones described above) using LTL operators and actually check if the model satisfies this property. One technique is to obtain a Büchi automaton that is equivalent to the model and another one that is equivalent to the negation of the property (cf. Linear temporal logic to Büchi automaton ). The intersection of the two non-deterministic Büchi automata is empty if the model satisfies the property. 8     Expressing important properties in formal verification  There are two main types of properties that can be expressed using linear temporal logic: safety properties usually state that something bad never happens ( G    ¬     \neg      ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ), while liveness properties state that something good keeps happening ( GF    ψ   ψ   \psi   or G     (  ϕ  →     fragments  normal-(  ϕ  normal-→    (\phi\rightarrow    F     ψ  )     fragments  ψ  normal-)    \psi)   ). More generally: Safety properties are those for which every counterexample has a finite prefix such that, however it is extended to an infinite path, it is still a counterexample. For liveness properties, on the other hand, every finite prefix of a counterexample can be extended to an infinite path that satisfies the formula.    Specification language  One of the applications of linear temporal logic is the specification of preferences in the Planning Domain Definition Language for the purpose of preference-based planning .
