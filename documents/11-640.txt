Uridine nucleosidase




Uridine nucleosidase

In enzymology, an uridine nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

uridine + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-ribose + uracil
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are uridine and H2O, whereas its two products are D-ribose and uracil.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is uridine ribohydrolase. This enzyme is also called uridine hydrolase. This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism.
