Hamming scheme

The Hamming scheme, named after Richard Hamming, is also known as the hyper-cubic association scheme, and it is the most important example for coding theory.123 In this scheme 
 
 
 
 , the set of binary vectors of length 
 
 
 
 , and two vectors 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
 -th associates if they are Hamming distance

 
  apart.
Recall that an association scheme is visualized as a complete graph with labeled edges. The graph has 
 
 
 
  vertices, one for each point of 
 
 
 
 , and the edge joining vertices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is labeled 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
 -th associates. Each edge has a unique label, and the number of triangles with a fixed base labeled 
 
 
 
  having the other edges labeled 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a constant 
 
 
 
 , depending on 
 
 
 
  but not on the choice of the base. In particular, each vertex is incident with exactly 
 
 
 
  edges labeled 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
  is the valency of the relation

 
 . The

Here, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The matrices in the Bose-Mesner algebra are 
 
 
matrices, with rows and columns labeled by vectors 
 
 
 
 . In particular the 
 
 
 
 -th entry of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  if and only if
