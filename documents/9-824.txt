   Two-dimensional point vortex gas      Two-dimensional point vortex gas   The two-dimensional point vortex gas is a discrete particle model used to study turbulence in two-dimensional ideal fluids . The two-dimensional guiding-center plasma is a completely equivalent model used in plasma physics.  General setup  The model is a Hamiltonian system of N points in the two-dimensional plane executing the motion          k  i     d   x  i     d  t     =    ∂  H    ∂   y  i      ,     k  i     d   y  i     d  t     =   -    ∂  H    ∂   x  i        ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  k  i       d   subscript  x  i      d  t         H      subscript  y  i           subscript  k  i       d   subscript  y  i      d  t           H      subscript  x  i         k_{i}\frac{dx_{i}}{dt}=\frac{\partial H}{\partial y_{i}},\qquad k_{i}\frac{dy_%
 {i}}{dt}=-\frac{\partial H}{\partial x_{i}},     (In the confined version of the problem, the logarithmic potential is modified.)  Interpretations  In the point-vortex gas interpretation, the particles represent either point vortices in a two-dimensional fluid, or parallel line vortices in a three-dimensional fluid. The constant k i is the circulation of the fluid around the i th vortex. The Hamiltonian H is the interaction term of the fluid's integrated kinetic energy ; it may be either positive or negative. The equations of motion simply reflect the drift of each vortex's position in the velocity field of the other vortices.  In the guiding-center plasma interpretation, the particles represent long filaments of charge parallel to some external magnetic field. The constant k i is the linear charge density of the i th filament. The Hamiltonian H is just the two-dimensional Coulomb potential between lines. The equations of motion reflect the guiding center  drift of the charge filaments, hence the name.
