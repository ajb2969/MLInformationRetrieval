Ramanujan tau function

The Ramanujan tau function, studied by , is the function 
 
 
 
  defined by the following identity:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the Dedekind eta function and the function 
 
 
 
  is a holomorphic cusp form of weight 12 and level 1, known as the discriminant modular form. [[Image:Absolute Tau function for x up to 16,000 with logarithmic scale.JPG|thumbnail|Values of

Ramanujan's conjectures
observed, but could not prove, the following three properties of 
 
 
 
 
 :



 
  if 
 
 
 
  (meaning that 
 
 
 
  is a multiplicative function)


 
  for p prime and r > 0.


 
 
  for all primes p.

The first two properties were proved by  and the third one, called the Ramanujan conjecture, was proved by Deligne in 1974 as a consequence of his proof of the Weil conjectures.
Congruences for the tau function
For k ∈ Z and n ∈ Z>0, define σk(n) as the sum of the k-th powers of the divisors of n. The tau function satisfies several congruence relations; many of them can be expressed in terms of σk(n). Here are some:1

Conjectures on τ(n)
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a weight 
 
 
 
 
  integer newform and the Fourier coefficients 
 
 
 
  are integers. Consider the problem: If 
 
 
 
  does not have complex multiplication, prove that almost all primes 
 
 
 
  have the property that 
 
 
 
 . Indeed, most primes should have this property, and hence they are called ordinary. Despite the big advances by Deligne and Serre on Galois representations, which determine 
 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  coprime to 
 
 
 
 , we do not have any clue as to how to compute 
 
 
 
 . The only theorem in this regard is Elkies' famous result for modular elliptic curves, which indeed guarantees that there are infinitely many primes 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
 
 , which in turn is obviously 
 
 
 
 . We do not know any examples of non-CM 
 
 
 
  with weight 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
  mod 
 
 
 
 
  for infinitely many primes 
 
 
 
  (although it should be true for almost all 
 
 
 
 ). We also do not know any examples where 
 
 
 
  mod 
 
 
 
  for infinitely many 
 
 
 
 
 . Some people had begun to doubt whether 
 
 
 
  indeed for infinitely many 
 
 
 
 . As evidence, many provided Ramanujan's 
 
 
 
  (case of weight 
 
 
 
 ). The largest known 
 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . The only solutions to the equation 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  up to

  for all 
 
 
 
 , an assertion sometimes known as Lehmer's conjecture. Lehmer verified the conjecture for 
 
 
 
  (Apostol 1997, p. 22). The following table summarizes progress on finding successively larger values of 
 
 
 
 
  for which this condition holds.
