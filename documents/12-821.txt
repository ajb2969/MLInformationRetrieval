   Skorokhod integral      Skorokhod integral   In mathematics , the Skorokhod integral , often denoted δ , is an operator of great importance in the theory of stochastic processes . It is named after the Ukrainian  mathematician  Anatoliy Skorokhod . Part of its importance is that it unifies several concepts:   δ is an extension of the Itō integral to non- adapted processes ;  δ is the adjoint of the Malliavin derivative , which is fundamental to the stochastic calculus of variations ( Malliavin calculus );  δ is an infinite-dimensional generalization of the divergence operator from classical vector calculus .   Definition  Preliminaries: the Malliavin derivative  Consider a fixed probability space (Ω, Σ, P ) and a Hilbert space  H ; E denotes expectation with respect to P        𝐄   [  X  ]    :=    ∫  Ω    X   (  ω  )   d  𝐏   (  ω  )      .     assign    𝐄   delimited-[]  X      subscript   normal-Ω     X  ω  normal-d  𝐏  ω      \mathbf{E}[X]:=\int_{\Omega}X(\omega)\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{P}(\omega).     Intuitively speaking, the Malliavin derivative of a random variable F in L p (Ω) is defined by expanding it in terms of Gaussian random variables that are parametrized by the elements of H and differentiating the expansion formally; the Skorokhod integral is the adjoint operation to the Malliavin derivative.  Consider a family of R -valued random variables  W ( h ), indexed by the elements h of the Hilbert space H . Assume further that each W ( h ) is a Gaussian ( normal ) random variable, that the map taking h to W ( h ) is a linear map , and that the mean and covariance structure is given by        𝐄   [   W   (  h  )    ]    =  0   ,        𝐄   delimited-[]    W  h     0    \mathbf{E}[W(h)]=0,           𝐄   [   W   (  g  )   W   (  h  )    ]    =    ⟨  g  ,  h  ⟩   H    ,        𝐄   delimited-[]    W  g  W  h      subscript   g  h   H     \mathbf{E}[W(g)W(h)]=\langle g,h\rangle_{H},     for all g and h in H . It can be shown that, given H , there always exists a probability space (Ω, Σ, P ) and a family of random variables with the above properties. The Malliavin derivative is essentially defined by formally setting the derivative of the random variable W ( h ) to be h , and then extending this definition to “ smooth enough ” random variables. For a random variable F of the form       F  =   f   (   W   (   h  1   )    ,  …  ,   W   (   h  n   )    )     ,      F    f     W   subscript  h  1    normal-…    W   subscript  h  n        F=f(W(h_{1}),\ldots,W(h_{n})),     where f : R n → R is smooth, the Malliavin derivative is defined using the earlier “formal definition” and the chain rule:        D  F   :=    ∑   i  =  1   n      ∂  f    ∂   x  i      (   W   (   h  1   )    ,  …  ,   W   (   h  n   )    )    h  i      .     assign    normal-D  F     superscript   subscript     i  1    n         f      subscript  x  i        W   subscript  h  1    normal-…    W   subscript  h  n      subscript  h  i       \mathrm{D}F:=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}(W(h_{1}),\ldots,W%
 (h_{n}))h_{i}.     In other words, whereas F was a real-valued random variable, its derivative D F is an H -valued random variable, an element of the space L p (Ω; H ). Of course, this procedure only defines D F for “smooth” random variables, but an approximation procedure can be employed to define D F for F in a large subspace of L p (Ω); the domain of D is the closure of the smooth random variables in the seminorm :         ∥  F  ∥    1  ,  p    :=    (    𝐄   [    |  F  |   p   ]    +   𝐄   [    ∥   D  F   ∥   H  p   ]     )    1  /  p     .     assign   subscript   norm  F    1  p     superscript      𝐄   delimited-[]   superscript    F   p       𝐄   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript   norm    normal-D  F    H   p        1  p      \|F\|_{1,p}:=\big(\mathbf{E}[|F|^{p}]+\mathbf{E}[\|\mathrm{D}F\|_{H}^{p}]\big)%
 ^{1/p}.     This space is denoted by D 1, p and is called the Watanabe-Sobolev space .  The Skorokhod integral  For simplicity, consider now just the case p = 2. The Skorokhod integral  δ is defined to be the L 2 -adjoint of the Malliavin derivative D. Just as D was not defined on the whole of L 2 (Ω), δ is not defined on the whole of L 2 (Ω; H ): the domain of δ consists of those processes u in L 2 (Ω; H ) for which there exists a constant C ( u ) such that, for all F in D 1,2 ,        |   𝐄   [    ⟨   D  F   ,  u  ⟩   H   ]    |   ≤   C   (  u  )     ∥  F  ∥     L  2    (  Ω  )       .          𝐄   delimited-[]   subscript     normal-D  F   u   H        C  u   subscript   norm  F      superscript  L  2   normal-Ω       \big|\mathbf{E}[\langle\mathrm{D}F,u\rangle_{H}]\big|\leq C(u)\|F\|_{L^{2}(%
 \Omega)}.     The Skorokhod integral of a process u in L 2 (Ω; H ) is a real-valued random variable δu in L 2 (Ω); if u lies in the domain of δ , then δu is defined by the relation that, for all F ∈ D 1,2 ,        𝐄   [    F   δ  u   ]    =   𝐄   [    ⟨   D  F   ,  u  ⟩   H   ]     .        𝐄   delimited-[]    F  δ  u       𝐄   delimited-[]   subscript     normal-D  F   u   H       \mathbf{E}[F\,\delta u]=\mathbf{E}[\langle\mathrm{D}F,u\rangle_{H}].     Just as the Malliavin derivative D was first defined on simple, smooth random variables, the Skorokhod integral has a simple expression for “simple processes”: if u is given by      u  =    ∑   j  =  1   n     F  j    h  j         u    superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  F  j    subscript  h  j       u=\sum_{j=1}^{n}F_{j}h_{j}     with F j smooth and h j in H , then        δ  u   =    ∑   j  =  1   n    (     F  j   W   (   h  j   )    -    ⟨   D   F  j    ,   h  j   ⟩   H    )     .        δ  u     superscript   subscript     j  1    n        subscript  F  j   W   subscript  h  j     subscript     normal-D   subscript  F  j     subscript  h  j    H       \delta u=\sum_{j=1}^{n}\left(F_{j}W(h_{j})-\langle\mathrm{D}F_{j},h_{j}\rangle%
 _{H}\right).     Properties   The isometry property: for any process u in L 2 (Ω; H ) that lies in the domain of δ ,           𝐄   [    (   δ  u   )   2   ]    =    𝐄   [    ∥  u  ∥   H  2   ]    +   𝐄   [    ∥   D  u   ∥    H  ⊗  H   2   ]      .        𝐄   delimited-[]   superscript    δ  u   2         𝐄   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript   norm  u   H   2       𝐄   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript   norm    normal-D  u     tensor-product  H  H    2        \mathbf{E}\big[(\delta u)^{2}\big]=\mathbf{E}\big[\|u\|_{H}^{2}\big]+\mathbf{E%
 }\big[\|\mathrm{D}u\|_{H\otimes H}^{2}\big].         If u is an adapted process, then the second term on the right-hand side is zero, the Skorokhod and Itō integrals coincide, and the above equation becomes the Itō isometry .    The derivative of a Skorokhod integral is given by the formula            D  h    (   δ  u   )    =     ⟨  u  ,  h  ⟩   H   +   δ   (    D  h   u   )      ,         subscript  normal-D  h     δ  u       subscript   u  h   H     δ     subscript  normal-D  h   u       \mathrm{D}_{h}(\delta u)=\langle u,h\rangle_{H}+\delta(\mathrm{D}_{h}u),         where D h X stands for (D X )( h ), the random variable that is the value of the process D X at “time” h in H .    The Skorokhod integral of the product of a random variable F in D 1,2 and a process u in dom( δ ) is given by the formula           δ   (   F  u   )    =     F   δ  u   -    ⟨   D  F   ,  u  ⟩   H     .        δ    F  u        F  δ  u    subscript     normal-D  F   u   H      \delta(Fu)=F\,\delta u-\langle\mathrm{D}F,u\rangle_{H}.
