   Wood method      Wood method   The Wood method , also known as the Merchant–Rankine–Wood method , is a structural analysis method which was developed to determine estimates for the effective buckling length of a compressed member included in a building frames, both in sway and a non-sway buckling modes. 1 2 It is named after R. H. Wood.  According to this method, the ratio between the critical buckling length and the real length of a column is determined based on two redistribution coefficients,    η  1     subscript  η  1    \eta_{1}   and    η  2     subscript  η  2    \eta_{2}   , which are mapped to a ratio between the effective buckling length of a compressed member and its real length.  The redistribution coefficients are obtained through the following expressions:        η  i   =     K  c   +   K  i      K  c   +   K  i   +    K  i   1   +    K  i   2      ,   i  =   1  ,  2       formulae-sequence     subscript  η  i        subscript  K  c    subscript  K  i       subscript  K  c    subscript  K  i      subscript  K  i   1      subscript  K  i   2        i   1  2      \eta_{i}=\frac{K_{c}+K_{i}}{K_{c}+K_{i}+K_{i}1+K_{i}2},\quad i=1,2   where    K  i     subscript  K  i    K_{i}   are the stiffness coefficients for the adjacent length of columns.  Although this method was included in ENV 1993-1-1:1992, it is absent from EN 1993-1-1 .
