Wood method

The Wood method, also known as the Merchant–Rankine–Wood method, is a structural analysis method which was developed to determine estimates for the effective buckling length of a compressed member included in a building frames, both in sway and a non-sway buckling modes.12 It is named after R. H. Wood.
According to this method, the ratio between the critical buckling length and the real length of a column is determined based on two redistribution coefficients, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , which are mapped to a ratio between the effective buckling length of a compressed member and its real length.
The redistribution coefficients are obtained through the following expressions:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the stiffness coefficients for the adjacent length of columns.
Although this method was included in ENV 1993-1-1:1992, it is absent from EN 1993-1-1.
