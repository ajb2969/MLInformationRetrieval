   Lactaldehyde reductase      Lactaldehyde reductase   In enzymology , a lactaldehyde reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)[or (S)]-propane-1,2-diol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (R)[or (S)]-lactaldehyde + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (R)-propane-1,2-diol , (S)-propane-1,2-diol , and NAD + , whereas its 4 products are (R)-lactaldehyde , (S)-lactaldehyde , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)[or (S)]-propane-1,2-diol:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include propanediol:nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD + ) oxidoreductase , and L-lactaldehyde:propanediol oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
