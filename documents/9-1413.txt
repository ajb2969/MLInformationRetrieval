   Multimodal logic      Multimodal logic   A multimodal logic is a modal logic that has more than one primitive modal operator . They find substantial applications in theoretical computer science .  A modal logic with n primitive unary modal operators      □  i   ,  i   ∈   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }         subscript  normal-□  i   i    1  normal-…  n     \Box_{i},i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}   is called an n -modal logic. Given these operators and negation , one can always add    ◇  i     subscript  normal-◇  i    \Diamond_{i}   modal operators defined as     ◇  i   P       subscript  normal-◇  i   P    \Diamond_{i}P   if and only if    ¬   □  i   ¬  P        subscript  normal-□  i    P    \lnot\Box_{i}\lnot P   .  The first substantive example of a 2-modal logic is perhaps Arthur Prior 's tense logic , with two modalities, F and P, corresponding to "sometime in the future" and "sometime in the past". A logic 1 with infinitely many modalities is (propositional) dynamic logic , introduced in 1976 and having a separate modal operator for every regular expression . A version of temporal logic introduced in 1977 and intended for program verification has two modalities, corresponding to dynamic logic's [ A ] and [ A *] modalities for a single program A , understood as the whole universe taking one step forwards in time. The term "multimodal logic" itself was not introduced until 1980. Another example of a multimodal logic is the Hennessy-Milner logic , itself a fragment of the more expressive modal μ-calculus , which additionally is also a fixed-point logic .  Multimodal logic can be used also to formalize a kind of knowledge representation : the motivation of epistemic logic is allowing several agents (they are regarded as subjects capable of forming beliefs, knowledge); and managing the belief or knowledge of each agent, so that epistemic assertions can be formed about them. The modal operator   □   normal-□   \Box   must be capable of bookkeeping the cognition of each agent, thus    □  i     subscript  normal-□  i    \Box_{i}   must be indexed on the set of the agents. The motivation is that     □  i   α       subscript  normal-□  i   α    \Box_{i}\alpha   should assert "The subject i has knowledge about   α   α   \alpha   being true". But it can be used also for formalizing "the subject i believes   α   α   \alpha   ". For formalization of meaning based on the possible world semantics approach, a multimodal generalization of Kripke semantics can be used: instead of a single "common" accessibility relation , there is a series of them indexed on the set of agents. 2  Notes    References       External links   Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy : " Modal logic " – by James Garson .
