   Base (group theory)      Base (group theory)   Let   G   G   G   be a finite permutation group acting on a set   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   . A sequence      B  =   [   β  1   ,   β  2   ,  …  ,   β  k   ]       B    subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2   normal-…   subscript  β  k      B=[\beta_{1},\beta_{2},...,\beta_{k}]     of ''k ''distinct elements of   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a base for G if the only element of   G   G   G   which fixes every     β  i   ∈  B       subscript  β  i   B    \beta_{i}\in B   pointwise is the identity element of   G   G   G   . 1  Bases and strong generating sets are concepts of importance in computational group theory . A base and a strong generating set (together often called a BSGS) for a group can be obtained using the Schreier–Sims algorithm . 2  It is often beneficial to deal with bases and strong generating sets as these may be easier to work with than the entire group. A group may have a small base compared to the set it acts on. In the "worst case", the symmetric groups and alternating groups have large bases (the symmetric group S n has base size n − 1), and there are often specialized algorithms that deal with these cases.
