Scattering amplitude

In quantum physics, the scattering amplitude is the amplitude of the outgoing spherical wave relative to the incoming plane wave in a stationary-state scattering process.1 The latter is described by the wavefunction



where 
 
 
 
  is the position vector; 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
  is the incoming plane wave with the wavenumber

 
  along the 
 
 
 
  axis; 
 
 
 
  is the outgoing spherical wave; 
 
 
 
  is the scattering angle; and 
 
 
 
  is the scattering amplitude. The dimension of the scattering amplitude is length.
The scattering amplitude is a probability amplitude and the differential cross-section as a function of scattering angle is given as its modulus squared



In the low-energy regime the scattering amplitude is determined by the scattering length.
Partial wave expansion
In the partial wave expansion the scattering amplitude is represented as a sum over the partial waves,2


 
 , where  is the partial scattering amplitude and  are the Legendre polynomials.
The partial amplitude can be expressed via the partial wave S-matrix element  (
 
 
 
 ) and the scattering phase shift  as



Then the differential cross section is given by3

and the total elastic cross section becomes

where 
 
 
 
  is the imaginary part of

X-rays
The scattering length for X-rays is the Thomson scattering length or classical electron radius, 
 
 
 
 .
Neutrons
The nuclear neutron scattering process involves the coherent neutron scattering length, often described by 
 
 
 
 .
Quantum mechanical formalism
A quantum mechanical approach is given by the S matrix formalism.
