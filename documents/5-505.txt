   CCR and CAR algebras      CCR and CAR algebras   In mathematics and physics  CCR algebras (after canonical commutation relations ) and CAR algebras (after canonical anticommutation relations) arise from the quantum mechanical study of bosons and fermions respectively. They play a prominent role in quantum statistical mechanics 1 and quantum field theory .  CCR and CAR as *-algebras  Let   V   V   V   be a real  vector space equipped with a nonsingular real antisymmetric  bilinear form     (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    (\cdot,\cdot)   (i.e. a symplectic vector space ). The unital  *-algebra generated by elements of   V   V   V   subject to the relations        f  g   -   g  f    =   i   (  f  ,  g  )            f  g     g  f      i   f  g      fg-gf=i(f,g)\,           f  *   =  f   ,       superscript  f    f    f^{*}=f,\,     for any    f  ,  g     f  g    f,~{}g   in   V   V   V   is called the canonical commutation relations (CCR) algebra . The uniqueness of the representations of this algebra when   V   V   V   is finite dimensional is discussed in the Stone–von Neumann theorem .  If   V   V   V   is equipped with a nonsingular real symmetric bilinear form     (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    (\cdot,\cdot)   instead, the unital *-algebra generated by the elements of   V   V   V   subject to the relations         f  g   +   g  f    =   (  f  ,  g  )    ,          f  g     g  f     f  g     fg+gf=(f,g),\,           f  *   =  f   ,       superscript  f    f    f^{*}=f,\,   for any    f  ,  g     f  g    f,~{}g   in   V   V   V   is called the canonical anticommutation relations (CAR) algebra .  The C*-algebra of CCR  Let   H   H   H   be a real symplectic vector space with nonsingular symplectic form    (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    (\cdot,\cdot)   . In the theory of operator algebras the CCR algebra over   H   H   H   is the unital C*-algebra generated by elements    {   W   (  f  )    :   f  ∈  H   }     conditional-set    W  f     f  H     \{W(f):~{}f\in H\}   subject to        W   (  f  )   W   (  g  )    =    e   -   i   (  f  ,  g  )      W   (   f  +  g   )     ,        W  f  W  g      superscript  e      i   f  g      W    f  g      W(f)W(g)=e^{-i(f,g)}W(f+g),\,           W    (  f  )   *    =   W   (   -  f   )     .        W   superscript  f       W    f      W(f)^{*}=W(-f).\,   These are called the Weyl form of the canonical commutation relations and, in particular, they imply that each    W   (  f  )       W  f    W(f)   is unitary and     W   (  0  )    =  1        W  0   1    W(0)=1   . It is well known that the CCR algebra is a simple non-separable algebra and is unique up to isomorphism. 2  When   H   H   H   is a Hilbert space and    (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    (\cdot,\cdot)   is given by the imaginary part of the inner-product, the CCR algebra is faithfully represented on the symmetric Fock space over   H   H   H   by setting        W   (  f  )    (  1  ,  g  ,    g    ⊗  2     2  !    ,    g    ⊗  3     3  !    ,  …  )    =    e    -    1  2     ||  f  ||   2     -   ⟨  f  ,  g  ⟩      (  1  ,   f  +  g   ,     (   f  +  g   )     ⊗  2     2  !    ,     (   f  +  g   )     ⊗  3     3  !    ,  …  )     ,        W  f   1  g     superscript  g   tensor-product  absent  2      2       superscript  g   tensor-product  absent  3      3    normal-…       superscript  e          1  2    superscript   norm  f   2      f  g      1    f  g      superscript    f  g    tensor-product  absent  2      2       superscript    f  g    tensor-product  absent  3      3    normal-…      W(f)\left(1,g,\frac{g^{\otimes 2}}{2!},\frac{g^{\otimes 3}}{3!},\ldots\right)=%
 e^{-\frac{1}{2}||f||^{2}-\langle f,g\rangle}\left(1,f+g,\frac{(f+g)^{\otimes 2%
 }}{2!},\frac{(f+g)^{\otimes 3}}{3!},\ldots\right),\,   for any     f  ,  g   ∈  H       f  g   H    f,g\in H   . The field operators    B   (  f  )       B  f    B(f)   are defined for each    f  ∈  H      f  H    f\in H   as the generator of the one-parameter unitary group     (   W   (   t  f   )    )    t  ∈  ℝ      subscript    W    t  f      t  ℝ     (W(tf))_{t\in\mathbb{R}}   on the symmetric Fock space. These are self-adjoint  unbounded operators , however they formally satisfy         B   (  f  )   B   (  g  )    -   B   (  g  )   B   (  f  )     =   2  i  Im   ⟨  f  ,  g  ⟩     .          B  f  B  g     B  g  B  f      2  i  Im   f  g      B(f)B(g)-B(g)B(f)=2i\mathrm{Im}\langle f,g\rangle.\,   As the assignment    f  ↦   B   (  f  )       maps-to  f    B  f     f\mapsto B(f)   is real-linear, so the operators    B   (  f  )       B  f    B(f)   define a CCR algebra over    (  H  ,   2  I  m   ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩    )     H    2  normal-I  normal-m   normal-⋅  normal-⋅      (H,2\mathrm{Im}\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle)   in the sense of Section 1 .  The C*-algebra of CAR  Let   H   H   H   be a Hilbert space. In the theory of operator algebras the CAR algebra is the unique C*-completion of the complex unital *-algebra generated by elements    {    b   (  f  )    ,    b  *    (  f  )     :   f  ∈  H   }     conditional-set     b  f      superscript  b    f      f  H     \{b(f),b^{*}(f):~{}f\in H\}   subject to the relations         b   (  f  )    b  *    (  g  )    +    b  *    (  g  )   b   (  f  )     =   ⟨  f  ,  g  ⟩    ,          b  f   superscript  b    g      superscript  b    g  b  f     f  g     b(f)b^{*}(g)+b^{*}(g)b(f)=\langle f,g\rangle,\,            b   (  f  )   b   (  g  )    +   b   (  g  )   b   (  f  )     =  0   ,          b  f  b  g     b  g  b  f    0    b(f)b(g)+b(g)b(f)=0,\,           λ   b  *    (  f  )    =    b  *    (   λ  f   )     ,        λ   superscript  b    f      superscript  b      λ  f      \lambda b^{*}(f)=b^{*}(\lambda f),\,           b    (  f  )   *    =    b  *    (  f  )     ,        b   superscript  f        superscript  b    f     b(f)^{*}=b^{*}(f),\,   for any     f  ,  g   ∈  H       f  g   H    f,g\in H   ,    λ  ∈  ℂ      λ  ℂ    \lambda\in\mathbb{C}   . When   H   H   H   is separable the CAR algebra is an AF algebra and in the special case   H   H   H   is infinite dimensional it is often written as     M   2  ∞     (  ℂ  )        subscript  M   superscript  2     ℂ    {M_{2^{\infty}}(\mathbb{C})}   . 3  Let     F  a    (  H  )        subscript  F  a   H    F_{a}(H)   be the antisymmetric Fock space over   H   H   H   and let    P  a     subscript  P  a    P_{a}   be the orthogonal projection onto antisymmetric vectors:        P  a   :     ⊕   n  =  0   ∞    H    ⊗  n     →    F  a    (  H  )      .     normal-:   subscript  P  a    normal-→    superscript   subscript  direct-sum    n  0       superscript  H   tensor-product  absent  n        subscript  F  a   H      P_{a}:\bigoplus_{n=0}^{\infty}H^{\otimes n}\to F_{a}(H).\,   The CAR algebra is faithfully represented on     F  a    (  H  )        subscript  F  a   H    F_{a}(H)   by setting        b  *    (  f  )    P  a    (    g  1   ⊗   g  2   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   g  n    )    =    P  a    (    f  ⊗   g  1   ⊗   g  2   ⊗  ⋯    g  n    )           superscript  b    f   subscript  P  a    tensor-product   subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2   normal-⋯   subscript  g  n        subscript  P  a      tensor-product  f   subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2   normal-⋯    subscript  g  n       b^{*}(f)P_{a}(g_{1}\otimes g_{2}\otimes\cdots\otimes g_{n})=P_{a}(f\otimes g_{%
 1}\otimes g_{2}\otimes\cdots g_{n})\,   for all     f  ,   g  1   ,  …  ,   g  n    ∈  H       f   subscript  g  1   normal-…   subscript  g  n    H    f,g_{1},\ldots,g_{n}\in H   and    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   . The fact that these form a C*-algebra is due to the fact that creation and annihilation operators on antisymmetric Fock space are bona-fide bounded operators . Moreover the field operators     B   (  f  )    :=     b  *    (  f  )    +   b   (  f  )        assign    B  f        superscript  b    f     b  f      B(f):=b^{*}(f)+b(f)   satisfy         B   (  f  )   B   (  g  )    +   B   (  g  )   B   (  f  )     =   2  R  e   ⟨  f  ,  g  ⟩     ,          B  f  B  g     B  g  B  f      2  normal-R  normal-e   f  g      B(f)B(g)+B(g)B(f)=2\mathrm{Re}\langle f,g\rangle,\,   giving the relationship with Section 1 .  Superalgebra generalization  Let   V   V   V   be a real    ℤ  2     subscript  ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}_{2}   - graded vector space equipped with a nonsingular antisymmetric bilinear superform    (  ⋅  ,  ⋅  )     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    (\cdot,\cdot)   (i.e.     (  g  ,  f  )   =   -     (   -  1   )     |  f  |    |  g  |      (  f  ,  g  )          g  f        superscript    1       f     g      f  g       (g,f)=-(-1)^{|f||g|}(f,g)   ) such that    (  f  ,  g  )     f  g    (f,g)   is real if either   f   f   f   or   g   g   g   is an even element and imaginary if both of them are odd. The unital *-algebra generated by the elements of   V   V   V   subject to the relations        f  g   -     (   -  1   )     |  f  |    |  g  |     g  f    =   i   (  f  ,  g  )            f  g      superscript    1       f     g     g  f      i   f  g      fg-(-1)^{|f||g|}gf=i(f,g)\,           f  *   =  f   ,    g  *   =   g       formulae-sequence     superscript  f    f      superscript  g    g     f^{*}=f,~{}g^{*}=g\,     for any two pure elements    f  ,  g     f  g    f,~{}g   in   V   V   V   is the obvious superalgebra generalization which unifies CCRs with CARs: if all pure elements are even, one obtains a CCR, while if all pure elements are odd, one obtains a CAR.  The graded generalizations of Weyl and Clifford algebras allow the basis-free formulation of the canonical commutation and anticommutation relations in terms of a symplectic and a symmetric non-degenerate bilinear form. In addition the binary elements in this graded Weyl algebra give a basis-free version of the commutation relations of the symplectic and pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebras. 4  See also   Bose–Einstein statistics  Fermi–Dirac statistics  Glossary of string theory  Heisenberg group  Bogoliubov transformation  (−1) F   References    "  Category:Quantum field theory  Category:Functional analysis  Category:Algebras  Category:C*-algebras     ↩  ↩  . ↩  ↩
