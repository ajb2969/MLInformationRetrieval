   Truncated icosahedron      Truncated icosahedron   In geometry , the truncated icosahedron is an Archimedean solid , one of 13 convex isogonal nonprismatic solids whose faces are two or more types of regular polygons .  It has 12 regular pentagonal faces, 20 regular hexagonal faces, 60 vertices and 90 edges.  It is the Goldberg polyhedron G V (1,1), containing pentagonal and hexagonal faces.  This geometry is associated with footballs (soccer balls) typically patterned with white hexagons and black pentagons. Geodesic domes are often based on this structure. It also corresponds to the geometry of the " Bucky Ball" (Carbon-60, or C 60 ) molecule.  It is used in the cell-transitive hyperbolic space-filling tessellation, the bitruncated order-5 dodecahedral honeycomb .  Construction  This polyhedron can be constructed from an icosahedron with the 12 vertices truncated (cut off) such that one third of each edge is cut off at each of both ends. This creates 12 new pentagon faces, and leaves the original 20 triangle faces as regular hexagons. Thus the length of the edges is one third of that of the original edges.       Icosahedron     Cartesian coordinates  Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a truncated icosahedron centered at the origin are all even permutations of:   (0, ±1, ±3ϕ)  (±2, ±(1+2ϕ), ±ϕ)  (±1, ±(2+ϕ), ±2ϕ)   where ϕ = (1 + √5) / 2 is the golden mean . Using ϕ 2 = ϕ + 1 one verifies that all vertices are on a sphere, centered at the origin, with the radius squared equal to 9ϕ + 10. The edges have length 2. 1  Permutations:   X axis  (±3ϕ, 0, ±1)  (±(1+2ϕ), ±ϕ, ±2)  (±(2+ϕ), ±2ϕ, ±1)    Y axis  (±1, ±3ϕ, 0)  (±2, ±(1+2ϕ), ±ϕ)  (±1, ±(2+ϕ), ±2ϕ)    Z axis  (0, ±1, ±3ϕ)  (±ϕ, ±2, ±(1+2ϕ))  (±2ϕ, ±1, ±(2+ϕ))     Orthogonal projections  The truncated icosahedron has five special orthogonal projections , centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and two types of faces: hexagonal and pentagonal. The last two correspond to the A 2 and H 2  Coxeter planes .      Orthogonal projections     Centered by     Image     Projective symmetry     Dual     Spherical tiling  The truncated icosahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling , and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection . This projection is conformal , preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.

 .47801866\cdot a     where φ is the golden ratio .  This result is easy to get by using one of the three orthogonal golden rectangles drawn into the original icosahedron (before cut off) as the starting point for our considerations. The angle between the segments joining the center and the vertices connected by shared edge (calculated on the basis of this construction) is approx. 23.281446°.  Area and volume  The area A and the volume V of the truncated icosahedron of edge length a are:     A   A   \displaystyle A     Geometric relations  The truncated icosahedron easily verifies the Euler characteristic :   32 + 60 − 90 = 2.   With unit edges, the surface area is (rounded) 21 for the pentagons and 52 for the hexagons, together 73 (see areas of regular polygons ).  Applications  The balls used in association football and team handball are perhaps the best-known example of a spherical polyhedron analog to the truncated icosahedron, found in everyday life. 2 The ball comprises the same pattern of regular pentagons and regular hexagons, but it is more spherical due to the pressure of the air inside and the elasticity of the ball. This ball type was introduced to the World Cup in 1970 (starting in 2006 , this iconic design has been superseded by alternative patterns ).  Geodesic domes are typically based on triangular facetings of this geometry with example structures found across the world, popularized by Buckminster Fuller .  A variation of the icosahedron was used as the basis of the honeycomb wheels (made from a polycast material) used by the Pontiac Motor Division between 1971 to 1976 on its Trans Am and Grand Prix .  This shape was also the configuration of the lenses used for focusing the explosive shock waves of the detonators in both the gadget and Fat Man  atomic bombs . 3  The truncated icosahedron can also be described as a model of the Buckminsterfullerene (fullerene) (C 60 ), or "buckyball," molecule, an allotrope of elemental carbon, discovered in 1985. The diameter of the football and the fullerene molecule are 22 cm and about 1 nm , respectively, hence the size ratio is 220,000,000:1.
