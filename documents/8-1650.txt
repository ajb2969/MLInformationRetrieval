Markus–Yamabe conjecture

In mathematics, the Markus–Yamabe conjecture is a conjecture on global asymptotic stability. The conjecture states that if a continuously differentiable map on an 
 
 
 
 -dimensional real vector space has a single fixed point, and its Jacobian matrix is everywhere Hurwitz, then the fixed point is globally stable.
The conjecture is true for the two-dimensional case. However, counterexamples have been constructed in higher dimensions. Hence, in the two-dimensional case only, it can also be referred to as the Markus–Yamabe theorem.
Related mathematical results concerning global asymptotic stability, which are applicable in dimensions higher than two, include various autonomous convergence theorems. A modified version of the Markus–Yamabe conjecture has been proposed, but at present this new conjecture remains unproven.1 Analog of the conjecture for nonlinear control system with scalar nonlinearity is known as Kalman's conjecture.
Mathematical statement of conjecture

Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
  map with 
 
 
 
 
  and Jacobian 
 
 
 
  which is Hurwitz stable for every 
 
 
 
 .
 


Then 
 
 
 
  is a global attractor of the dynamical system 
 
 
 
 .
 

The conjecture is true for 
 
 
 
 
  and false in general for 
 
 
 
 .
