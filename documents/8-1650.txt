   Markus–Yamabe conjecture      Markus–Yamabe conjecture   In mathematics , the Markus–Yamabe conjecture is a conjecture on global asymptotic stability . The conjecture states that if a continuously differentiable map on an   n   n   n   -dimensional real  vector space has a single fixed point , and its Jacobian matrix is everywhere Hurwitz , then the fixed point is globally stable.  The conjecture is true for the two-dimensional case. However, counterexamples have been constructed in higher dimensions. Hence, in the two-dimensional case only , it can also be referred to as the Markus–Yamabe theorem .  Related mathematical results concerning global asymptotic stability, which are applicable in dimensions higher than two, include various autonomous convergence theorems . A modified version of the Markus–Yamabe conjecture has been proposed, but at present this new conjecture remains unproven. 1 Analog of the conjecture for nonlinear control system with scalar nonlinearity is known as Kalman's conjecture .  Mathematical statement of conjecture   Let    f  :    ℝ  n   →   ℝ  n       normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n    superscript  ℝ  n      f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{n}   be a    C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}   map with     f   (  0  )    =  0        f  0   0    f(0)=0   and Jacobian    D  f   (  x  )       D  f  x    Df(x)   which is Hurwitz stable for every    x  ∈   ℝ  n       x   superscript  ℝ  n     x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   .    Then   0   0    is a global attractor of the dynamical system     x  ˙   =   f   (  x  )         normal-˙  x     f  x     \dot{x}=f(x)   .   The conjecture is true for    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   and false in general for    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   .  Notes    References   L. Markus and H.
