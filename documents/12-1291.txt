Construction  It is created by a Wythoff construction upon a set of 8 hyperplane mirrors in 7-dimensional space.  The facet information can be extracted from its Coxeter-Dynkin diagram .      Removing the node on the short branch leaves the 6-simplex facet:      Removing the node on the end of the 3-length branch leaves the 3 21 facet:      The vertex figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes 2 31 polytope.      The edge figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes 6-demicube ( 1 31 ).      The face figure is determined by removing the ringed node and ringing the neighboring node. This makes rectified 5-simplex ( 0 31 ).      The cell figure is determined by removing the ringed node of the face figure and ringing the neighboring nodes. This makes tetrahedral prism {}×{3,3}.      Kissing number  Each vertex of this tessellation is the center of a 6-sphere in the densest known packing in 7 dimensions; its kissing number is 126, represented by the vertices of its vertex figure  2 31 .  E7 lattice       E  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  E   7    {\tilde{E}}_{7}   contains     A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}   as a subgroup of index 144. 1 Both     E  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  E   7    {\tilde{E}}_{7}   and     A  ~   7     subscript   normal-~  A   7    {\tilde{A}}_{7}   can be seen as affine extension from    A  7     subscript  A  7    A_{7}   from different nodes:  The vertex arrangement of 3 31 is called the E 7 lattice . 2 The E 7 lattice can also be expressed as a union of the vertices of two A 7 lattices, also called A 7 2 :    =  ∪    The E 7 * lattice (also called E 7 2 ) 3 has double the symmetry, represented by 3,3 3,3 . The Voronoi cell of the E 7 * lattice is the 1 32 polytope, and voronoi tessellation the 1 33 honeycomb . 4 The E 7 * lattice is constructed by 2 copies of the E 7 lattice vertices, one from each long branch of the Coxeter diagram, and can be constructed as the union of four A 7 * lattices, also called A 7 4 :    ∪  =  ∪  ∪  ∪  = dual of .    Related honeycombs  It is in a dimensional series of uniform polytopes and honeycombs, expressed by Coxeter as 3 k1 series. A degenerate 4-dimensional case exists as 3-sphere tiling, a tetrahedral hosohedron .  See also   8-polytope  1 33 honeycomb   References   H. S. M.
