   Extensions of symmetric operators      Extensions of symmetric operators   In functional analysis , one is interested in extensions of symmetric operators acting on a Hilbert space . Of particular importance is the existence, and sometimes explicit constructions, of self-adjoint extensions. This problem arises, for example, when one needs to specify domains of self-adjointness for formal expressions of observables in quantum mechanics . Other applications of solutions to this problem can be seen in various moment problems .  This article discusses a few related problems of this type. The unifying theme is that each problem has an operator-theoretic characterization which gives a corresponding parametrization of solutions. More specifically, finding self-adjoint extensions, with various requirements, of symmetric operators is equivalent to finding unitary extensions of suitable partial isometries .  Symmetric operators  Let H be a Hilbert space. A linear operator  A acting on H with dense domain Dom( A ) is symmetric if   = , for all x , y in Dom( A ).   If Dom( A ) = H , the Hellinger-Toeplitz theorem says that A is a bounded operator , in which case A is self-adjoint and the extension problem is trivial. In general, a symmetric operator is self-adjoint if the domain of its adjoint, Dom( A* ), lies in Dom( A ).  When dealing with unbounded operators , it is often desirable to be able to assume that the operator in question is closed . In the present context, it is a convenient fact that every symmetric operator A is closable . That is, A has a smallest closed extension, called the closure of A . This can be shown by invoking the symmetric assumption and Riesz representation theorem . Since A and its closure have the same closed extensions, it can always be assumed that the symmetric operator of interest is closed.  In the sequel, a symmetric operator will be assumed to be densely defined and closed.  Problem  Given a densely defined closed symmetric operator A, find its self-adjoint extensions.  This question can be translated to an operator-theoretic one. As a heuristic motivation, notice that the Cayley transform on the complex plane, defined by      z  ‚Ü¶    z  -  i    z  +  i       maps-to  z      z  i     z  i      z\mapsto\frac{z-i}{z+i}     maps the real line to the unit circle. This suggests one define, for a symmetric operator A ,       U  A   =    (   A  -  i   )      (   A  +  i   )    -  1           subscript  U  A       A  i    superscript    A  i     1       U_{A}=(A-i)(A+i)^{-1}\,     on Ran ( A + i ), the range of A + i . The operator U A is in fact an isometry between closed subspaces that takes ( A + i ) x to ( A - i ) x for x in Dom( A ). The map      A  ‚Ü¶   U  A      maps-to  A   subscript  U  A     A\mapsto U_{A}     is also called the Cayley transform of the symmetric operator A . Given U A , A can be recovered by       A  =   -   i   (   U  +  1   )     (   U  -  1   )    -  1       ,      A      i    U  1    superscript    U  1     1        A=-i(U+1)(U-1)^{-1},\,     defined on Dom ( A ) = Ran ( U - 1). Now if      U  ~     normal-~  U    \tilde{U}     is an isometric extension of U A , the operator       A  ~   =   -   i   (    U  ~   +  1   )     (    U  ~   -  1   )    -  1           normal-~  A       i     normal-~  U   1    superscript     normal-~  U   1     1        \tilde{A}=-i(\tilde{U}+1)(\tilde{U}-1)^{-1}     acting on       R  a  n   (   -    i  2    (    U  ~   -  1   )     )    =   R  a  n   (    U  ~   -  1   )          R  a  n        i  2      normal-~  U   1        R  a  n     normal-~  U   1      Ran(-\frac{i}{2}(\tilde{U}-1))=Ran(\tilde{U}-1)     is a symmetric extension of A .  Theorem The symmetric extensions of a closed symmetric operator A is in one-to-one correspondence with the isometric extensions of its Cayley transform U A .  Of more interest is the existence of self-adjoint extensions. The following is true.  Theorem A closed symmetric operator A is self-adjoint if and only if Ran ( A ¬± i ) = H , i.e. when its Cayley transform U A is a unitary operator on H .  Corollary The self-adjoint extensions of a closed symmetric operator A is in one-to-one correspondence with the unitary extensions of its Cayley transform U A .  Define the deficiency subspaces of A by       K  +   =   R  a  n    (   A  +  i   )   ‚üÇ         subscript  K      R  a  n   superscript    A  i   perpendicular-to      K_{+}=Ran(A+i)^{\perp}     and        K  -   =   R  a  n    (   A  -  i   )   ‚üÇ     .       subscript  K      R  a  n   superscript    A  i   perpendicular-to      K_{-}=Ran(A-i)^{\perp}.     In this language, the description of the self-adjoint extension problem given by the corollary can be restated as follows: a symmetric operator A has self-adjoint extensions if and only if its Cayley transform U A has unitary extensions to H , i.e. the deficiency subspaces K + and K - have the same dimension.  An example  Consider the Hilbert space L 2 [0,1]. On the subspace of absolutely continuous function that vanish on the boundary, define the operator A by        A  f   =   i   d   d  x    f    .        A  f     i    d    d  x    f     Af=i\frac{d}{dx}f.     Integration by parts shows A is symmetric. Its adjoint A* is the same operator with Dom( A* ) being the absolutely continuous functions with no boundary condition. We will see that extending A amounts to modifying the boundary conditions, thereby enlarging Dom( A ) and reducing Dom( A* ), until the two coincide.  Direct calculation shows that K + and K - are one-dimensional subspaces given by       K  +   =  s  p  a  n   {   œï  +   =  a  ‚ãÖ   e  x   }      fragments   subscript  K     s  p  a  n   fragments  normal-{   subscript  œï     a  normal-‚ãÖ   superscript  e  x   normal-}     K_{+}=span\{\phi_{+}=a\cdot e^{x}\}     and       K  -   =  s  p  a  n   {   œï  -   =  a  ‚ãÖ   e   -  x    }      fragments   subscript  K     s  p  a  n   fragments  normal-{   subscript  œï     a  normal-‚ãÖ   superscript  e    x    normal-}     K_{-}=span\{\phi_{-}=a\cdot e^{-x}\}     where a is a normalizing constant. So the self-adjoint extensions of A are parametrized by the unit circle in the complex plane,     |  Œ±  |   =  1        Œ±   1    {|Œ±|=1}   . For each unitary U Œ± : K - ‚Üí K + , defined by U Œ± ( œÜ - ) = Œ±œÜ + , there corresponds an extension A Œ± with domain        D  o  m   (   A  Œ±   )    =   {   f  +   Œ≤   (    Œ±   œï  -    -   œï  +    )     |    f  ‚àà   D  o  m   (  A  )     ,   Œ≤  ‚àà  ‚ÑÇ    }    .        D  o  m   subscript  A  Œ±     conditional-set    f    Œ≤      Œ±   subscript  œï      subscript  œï        formulae-sequence    f    D  o  m  A      Œ≤  ‚ÑÇ       Dom(A_{\alpha})=\{f+\beta(\alpha\phi_{-}-\phi_{+})|f\in Dom(A),\;\beta\in%
 \mathbb{C}\}.     If f ‚àà Dom( A Œ± ), then f is absolutely continuous and       |    f   (  0  )     f   (  1  )     |   =   |     e  Œ±   -  1    Œ±  -  e    |   =  1.              f  0     f  1             e  Œ±   1     Œ±  e          1.     \left|\frac{f(0)}{f(1)}\right|=\left|\frac{e\alpha-1}{\alpha-e}\right|=1.     Conversely, if f is absolutely continuous and f (0) = Œ≥f (1) for some complex Œ≥ with | Œ≥ | = 1, then f lies in the above domain.  The self-adjoint operators { A Œ± } are instances of the momentum operator in quantum mechanics.  Self-adjoint extension on a larger space  Every partial isometry can be extended, on a possibly larger space, to a unitary operator. Consequently, every symmetric operator has a self-adjoint extension, on a possibly larger space.  Positive symmetric operators  A symmetric operator A is called positive if  ‚â• 0 for all x in Dom ( A ). It is known that for every such A , one has dim( K + ) = dim( K - ). Therefore every positive symmetric operator has self-adjoint extensions. The more interesting question in this direction is whether A has positive self-adjoint extensions.  For two positive operators A and B , we put A ‚â§ B if        (   A  +  1   )    -  1    ‚â•    (   B  +  1   )    -  1         superscript    A  1     1     superscript    B  1     1      (A+1)^{-1}\geq(B+1)^{-1}     in the sense of bounded operators.  Structure of 2 √ó 2 matrix contractions  While the extension problem for general symmetric operators is essentially that of extending partial isometries to unitaries, for positive symmetric operators the question becomes one of extending contractions : by "filling out" certain unknown entries of a 2 √ó 2 self-adjoint contraction, we obtain the positive self-adjoint extensions of a positive symmetric operator.  Before stating the relevant result, we first fix some terminology. For a contraction Œì, acting on H , we define its defect operators by         D  Œì   =     (   1  -    Œì  *   Œì    )    1  2    and      D   Œì  *    =    (   1  -   Œì   Œì  *     )    1  2      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  D  normal-Œì     superscript    1     superscript  normal-Œì    normal-Œì      1  2    and       subscript  D   superscript  normal-Œì      superscript    1    normal-Œì   superscript  normal-Œì        1  2       D_{\Gamma}=(1-\Gamma^{*}\Gamma)^{\frac{1}{2}}\quad\mbox{and}\quad D_{\Gamma^{*%
 }}=(1-\Gamma\Gamma^{*})^{\frac{1}{2}}.     The defect spaces of Œì are         ùíü  Œì   =    R  a  n   (   D  Œì   )    and      ùíü   Œì  *    =   R  a  n   (   D   Œì  *    )      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  ùíü  normal-Œì      R  a  n   subscript  D  normal-Œì    and       subscript  ùíü   superscript  normal-Œì       R  a  n   subscript  D   superscript  normal-Œì         \mathcal{D}_{\Gamma}=Ran(D_{\Gamma})\quad\mbox{and}\quad\mathcal{D}_{\Gamma^{*%
 }}=Ran(D_{\Gamma^{*}}).     The defect operators indicate the non-unitarity of Œì, while the defect spaces ensure uniqueness in some parameterizations. Using this machinery, one can explicitly describe the structure of general matrix contractions. We will only need the 2 √ó 2 case. Every 2 √ó 2 contraction Œì can be uniquely expressed as      Œì  =   [      Œì  1       D   Œì  1  *     Œì  2          Œì  3    D   Œì  1         -    Œì  3    Œì  1  *    Œì  2     +    D   Œì  3  *     Œì  4    D   Œì  2         ]       normal-Œì     subscript  normal-Œì  1      subscript  D   superscript   subscript  normal-Œì  1       subscript  normal-Œì  2         subscript  normal-Œì  3    subscript  D   subscript  normal-Œì  1            subscript  normal-Œì  3    superscript   subscript  normal-Œì  1      subscript  normal-Œì  2        subscript  D   superscript   subscript  normal-Œì  3       subscript  normal-Œì  4    subscript  D   subscript  normal-Œì  2          \Gamma=\begin{bmatrix}\Gamma_{1}&D_{\Gamma_{1}^{*}}\Gamma_{2}\\
 \Gamma_{3}D_{\Gamma_{1}}&-\Gamma_{3}\Gamma_{1}^{*}\Gamma_{2}+D_{\Gamma_{3}^{*}%
 }\Gamma_{4}D_{\Gamma_{2}}\end{bmatrix}     where each Œì i is a contraction.  Extensions of Positive symmetric operators  The Cayley transform for general symmetric operators can be adapted to this special case. For every non-negative number a ,       |    a  -  1    a  +  1    |   ‚â§  1.            a  1     a  1     1.    \left|\frac{a-1}{a+1}\right|\leq 1.     This suggests we assign to every positive symmetric operator A a contraction       C  A   :    R  a  n   (   A  +  1   )    ‚Üí   R  a  n   (   A  -  1   )    ‚äÇ  ‚Ñã      normal-:   subscript  C  A      normal-‚Üí    R  a  n    A  1      R  a  n    A  1         ‚Ñã      C_{A}:Ran(A+1)\rightarrow Ran(A-1)\subset\mathcal{H}     defined by       C  A    (  A  +  1  )   x  =   (  A  -  1  )   x  .  i.e.   C  A   =   (  A  -  1  )     (  A  +  1  )    -  1    .     fragments   subscript  C  A    fragments  normal-(  A   1  normal-)   x    fragments  normal-(  A   1  normal-)   x  normal-.   i.e.    subscript  C  A     fragments  normal-(  A   1  normal-)    superscript   fragments  normal-(  A   1  normal-)     1    normal-.    C_{A}(A+1)x=(A-1)x.\quad\mbox{i.e.}\quad C_{A}=(A-1)(A+1)^{-1}.\,     which have matrix representation         C  A   =   [      Œì  1         Œì  3    D   Œì  1        ]    :    R  a  n   (   A  +  1   )    ‚Üí      R  a  n   (   A  +  1   )        ‚äï       R  a  n    (   A  +  1   )   ‚üÇ         .     normal-:     subscript  C  A      subscript  normal-Œì  1        subscript  normal-Œì  3    subscript  D   subscript  normal-Œì  1         normal-‚Üí    R  a  n    A  1        R  a  n    A  1      direct-sum      R  a  n   superscript    A  1   perpendicular-to         C_{A}=\begin{bmatrix}\Gamma_{1}\\
 \Gamma_{3}D_{\Gamma_{1}}\end{bmatrix}:Ran(A+1)\rightarrow\begin{matrix}Ran(A+1%
 )\\
 \oplus\\
 Ran(A+1)^{\perp}\end{matrix}.     It is easily verified that the Œì 1 entry, C A projected onto Ran ( A + 1) = Dom ( C A ), is self-adjoint. The operator A can be written as      A  =    (   1  +   C  A    )      (   1  -   C  A    )    -  1          A      1   subscript  C  A     superscript    1   subscript  C  A      1       A=(1+C_{A})(1-C_{A})^{-1}\,     with Dom ( A ) = Ran ( C A - 1). If      C  ~     normal-~  C    \tilde{C}     is a contraction that extends C A and its projection onto its domain is self-adjoint, then it is clear that its inverse Cayley transform       A  ~   =    (   1  +   C  ~    )     (   1  -   C  ~    )    -  1          normal-~  A       1   normal-~  C     superscript    1   normal-~  C      1       \tilde{A}=(1+\tilde{C})(1-\tilde{C})^{-1}     defined on      R  a  n   (   1  -   C  ~    )       R  a  n    1   normal-~  C      Ran(1-\tilde{C})     is a positive symmetric extension of A . The symmetric property follows from its projection onto its own domain being self-adjoint and positivity follows from contractivity. The converse is also true: given a positive symmetric extension of A , its Cayley transform is a contraction satisfying the stated "partial" self-adjoint property.  Theorem The positive symmetric extensions of A are in one-to-one correspondence with the extensions of its Cayley transform where if C is such an extension, we require C projected onto Dom ( C ) be self-adjoint.  The unitarity criterion of the Cayley transform is replaced by self-adjointness for positive operators.  Theorem A symmetric positive operator A is self-adjoint if and only if its Cayley transform is a self-adjoint contraction defined on all of H , i.e. when Ran ( A + 1) = H .  Therefore finding self-adjoint extension for a positive symmetric operator becomes a " matrix completion problem". Specifically, we need to embed the column contraction C A into a 2 √ó 2 self-adjoint contraction. This can always be done and the structure of such contractions gives a parametrization of all possible extensions.  By the preceding subsection, all self-adjoint extensions of C A takes the form         C  ~    (   Œì  4   )    =   [      Œì  1       D   Œì  1     Œì  3  *          Œì  3    D   Œì  1         -    Œì  3    Œì  1    Œì  3  *     +    D   Œì  3  *     Œì  4    D   Œì  3  *         ]    .         normal-~  C    subscript  normal-Œì  4       subscript  normal-Œì  1      subscript  D   subscript  normal-Œì  1     superscript   subscript  normal-Œì  3           subscript  normal-Œì  3    subscript  D   subscript  normal-Œì  1            subscript  normal-Œì  3    subscript  normal-Œì  1    superscript   subscript  normal-Œì  3          subscript  D   superscript   subscript  normal-Œì  3       subscript  normal-Œì  4    subscript  D   superscript   subscript  normal-Œì  3            \tilde{C}(\Gamma_{4})=\begin{bmatrix}\Gamma_{1}&D_{\Gamma_{1}}\Gamma_{3}^{*}\\
 \Gamma_{3}D_{\Gamma_{1}}&-\Gamma_{3}\Gamma_{1}\Gamma_{3}^{*}+D_{\Gamma_{3}^{*}%
 }\Gamma_{4}D_{\Gamma_{3}^{*}}\end{bmatrix}.     So the self-adjoint positive extensions of A are in bijective correspondence with the self-adjoint contractions Œì 4 on the defect space      ùíü   Œì  3  *      subscript  ùíü   superscript   subscript  normal-Œì  3       \mathcal{D}_{\Gamma_{3}^{*}}     of Œì 3 . The contractions        C  ~    (   -  1   )    and    C  ~    (  1  )          normal-~  C     1    and     normal-~  C   1     \tilde{C}(-1)\quad\mbox{and}\quad\tilde{C}(1)     give rise to positive extensions       A  0   and   A  ‚àû       subscript  A  0   and   subscript  A      A_{0}\quad\mbox{and}\quad A_{\infty}     respectively. These are the smallest and largest positive extensions of A in the sense that       A  0   ‚â§  B  ‚â§   A  ‚àû          subscript  A  0   B        subscript  A       A_{0}\leq B\leq A_{\infty}     for any positive self-adjoint extension B of A . The operator A ‚àû is the Friedrichs extension of A and A 0 is the von Neumann-Krein extension of A .  Similar results can be obtained for accretive operators .  References   A. Alonso and B.
