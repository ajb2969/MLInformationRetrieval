   Gate orbit      Gate orbit   Gate orbits are optimal circular departure orbits for transfer from one planet to another. At certain specific orbits around a cosmic body, the additional delta- v required to go from orbital velocity to hyperbolic trajectory for an interplanetary transfer, is minimal. Gate orbits can therefore be very useful for minimising the delta- v budget for an interplanetary trip.  For example, the required delta- v for a Hohmann transfer orbit from the Earth to Mars (considering Earth at 1 AU and Mars at 1.52 AU) is 2.94 km/s. To reach 2.94 km/s at infinity from a low Earth orbit at, say 200 km altitude, requires a 3.61 km/s burn. If the vehicle were to leave the Earth's attraction from the 92,000 km high Mars gate orbit instead, required delta- v would be only 2.08 km/s. At higher still orbits the required delta- v rises again. For example, at 150,000 km, required delta-v is now 2.17 km/s.  Reducing the delta- v from 3.61 to 2.08 km/s can reduce the total mass of the vehicle by as much as 38%, or increase the payload by 62%!  The radius of a given gate orbit can be calculated using the following equation:      r  =    2  μ    v  ∞  2        r      2  μ    superscript   subscript  v    2      r={2\mu\over v_{\infty}^{2}}     where:       r    r   r\,   is the distance between the orbiting body and the central body , in km      μ    μ   \mu\,   is the standard gravitational parameter , in km 3 s −2       v  ∞      subscript  v     v_{\infty}\,   is the required velocity at infinity, in km·s −1 . Remember    v  ∞  2     superscript   subscript  v    2    v_{\infty}^{2}   is also known as    C  3      C  3    C3      External links   Interplanetary Gate Orbits by Marco Christov   "  Category:Spaceflight  Category:Orbital maneuvers
