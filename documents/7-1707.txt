   Monotone class theorem      Monotone class theorem   In measure theory and probability , the monotone class theorem connects monotone classes and sigma-algebras . The theorem says that the smallest monotone class containing an algebra of sets G is precisely the smallest σ-algebra containing G. It is used as a type of transfinite induction to prove many other theorems, such as Fubini's theorem .  Definition of a monotone class  A monotone class in a set   R   R   R   is a collection   M   M   M   of subsets of   R   R   R   which contains   R   R   R   and is closed under countable monotone unions and intersections, i.e. if     A  i   ∈  M       subscript  A  i   M    A_{i}\in M   and     A  1   ⊂   A  2   ⊂  …         subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2        normal-…     A_{1}\subset A_{2}\subset\ldots   then      ∪   i  =  1   ∞    A  i    ∈  M        superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  A  i    M    \cup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}\in M   , and similarly for intersections of decreasing sequences of sets.  Monotone class theorem for sets  Statement  Let G be an algebra of sets and define M(G) to be the smallest monotone class containing G. Then M(G) is precisely the σ-algebra generated by G, i.e. σ(G) = M(G)  Monotone class theorem for functions  Statement  Let   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   be a π-system that contains    Ω    normal-Ω   \Omega\,   and let   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   be a collection of functions from   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   to R with the following properties:  (1) If    A  ∈  𝒜      A  𝒜    A\in\mathcal{A}   , then     𝟏  A   ∈  ℋ       subscript  1  A   ℋ    \mathbf{1}_{A}\in\mathcal{H}     (2) If     f  ,  g   ∈  ℋ       f  g   ℋ    f,g\in\mathcal{H}   , then    f  +  g      f  g    f+g   and     c  f   ∈  ℋ        c  f   ℋ    cf\in\mathcal{H}   for any real number   c   c   c     (3) If     f  n   ∈  ℋ       subscript  f  n   ℋ    f_{n}\in\mathcal{H}   is a sequence of non-negative functions that increase to a bounded function   f   f   f   , then    f  ∈  ℋ      f  ℋ    f\in\mathcal{H}     Then   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   contains all bounded functions that are measurable with respect to    σ   (  𝒜  )       σ  𝒜    \sigma(\mathcal{A})   , the sigma-algebra generated by   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}     Proof  The following argument originates in Rick Durrett 's Probability: Theory and Examples. 1  The assumption     Ω   ∈  𝒜      normal-Ω  𝒜    \Omega\,\in\mathcal{A}   , (2) and (3) imply that    𝒢  =   {  A  :    𝟏  A   ∈  ℋ   }       𝒢   conditional-set  A     subscript  1  A   ℋ      \mathcal{G}=\{A:\mathbf{1}_{A}\in\mathcal{H}\}   is a λ-system. By (1) and the π − λ theorem ,     σ   (  𝒜  )    ⊂  𝒢        σ  𝒜   𝒢    \sigma(\mathcal{A})\subset\mathcal{G}   . (2) implies   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   contains all simple functions, and then (3) implies that   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   contains all bounded functions measurable with respect to    σ   (  𝒜  )       σ  𝒜    \sigma(\mathcal{A})   .  Results and Applications  As a corollary, if G is a ring of sets, then the smallest monotone class containing it coincides with the sigma-ring of G.  By invoking this theorem, one can use monotone classes to help verify that a certain collection of subsets is a sigma-algebra.  The monotone class theorem for functions can be a powerful tool that allows statements about particularly simple classes of functions to be generalized to arbitrary bounded and measurable functions.
