   Succinylornithine transaminase      Succinylornithine transaminase   In enzymology , a succinylornithine transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 2 -succinyl-L-ornithine + 2-oxoglutarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-succinyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde + L-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N2-succinyl-L-ornithine and 2-oxoglutarate , whereas its two products are N-succinyl-L-glutamate 5-semialdehyde and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N2-succinyl-L-ornithine:2-oxoglutarate 5-aminotransferase . Other names in common use include succinylornithine aminotransferase , N2-succinylornithine 5-aminotransferase , AstC , SOAT , and 2-N-succinyl-L-ornithine:2-oxoglutarate 5-aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism .  References         "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
