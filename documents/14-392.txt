Komlós–Major–Tusnády approximation

In theory of probability, the Komlós–Major–Tusnády approximation (also known as the KMT approximation, the KMT embedding, or the Hungarian embedding) is an approximation of the empirical process by a Gaussian process constructed on the same probability space. It is named after Hungarian mathematicians János Komlós, Gábor Tusnády, and Péter Major.
Theory
Let 
 
 
 
  be independent uniform (0,1) random variables. Define a uniform empirical distribution function as


 
  Define a uniform empirical process as


 
  The Donsker theorem (1952) shows that 
 
 
converges in law to a Brownian bridge

 
  Komlós, Major and Tusnády established a sharp bound for the speed of this weak convergence.

Theorem (KMT, 1975) On a suitable probability space for independent uniform (0,1) r.v. 
 
 
 
  the empirical process 
 
 
 
 
  can be approximated by a sequence of Brownian bridges 
 
 
 
  such that
 
 



for all positive integers n and all 
 
 
 
 , where a, b, and c are positive constants.
 

Corollary
A corollary of that theorem is that for any real iid r.v. 
 
 
 
  with cdf

 
 
  it is possible to construct a probability space where independent sequences of empirical processes 
 
 
 
  and Gaussian processes

 
  exist such that


 
      almost surely.
