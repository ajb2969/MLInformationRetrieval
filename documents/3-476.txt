   Hankel matrix      Hankel matrix   In linear algebra , a Hankel matrix (or catalecticant matrix ), named after Hermann Hankel , is a square matrix with constant skew-diagonals (positive sloping diagonals), e.g.:       [     a    b    c    d    e      b    c    d    e    f      c    d    e    f    g      d    e    f    g    h      e    f    g    h    i     ]   .      a  b  c  d  e    b  c  d  e  f    c  d  e  f  g    d  e  f  g  h    e  f  g  h  i     \begin{bmatrix}a&b&c&d&e\\
 b&c&d&e&f\\
 c&d&e&f&g\\
 d&e&f&g&h\\
 e&f&g&h&i\\
 \end{bmatrix}.     If the i , j element of A is denoted A i , j , then we have        A   i  ,  j    =   A    i  -  1   ,   j  +  1      .       subscript  A   i  j     subscript  A     i  1     j  1       A_{i,j}=A_{i-1,j+1}.     The Hankel matrix is closely related to the Toeplitz matrix (a Hankel matrix is an upside-down Toeplitz matrix). For a special case of this matrix see Hilbert matrix .  A Hankel operator on a Hilbert space is one whose matrix with respect to an orthonormal basis is a (possibly infinite) Hankel matrix     (   A   i  ,  j    )     i  ,  j   ≥  1      subscript   subscript  A   i  j       i  j   1     (A_{i,j})_{i,j\geq 1}   , where    A   i  ,  j      subscript  A   i  j     A_{i,j}   depends only on    i  +  j      i  j    i+j   .  The determinant of a Hankel matrix is called a catalecticant .  Hankel transform  The Hankel transform is the name sometimes given to the transformation of a sequence , where the transformed sequence corresponds to the determinant of the Hankel matrix. That is, the sequence     {   h  n   }    n  ≥  0      subscript    subscript  h  n      n  0     \{h_{n}\}_{n\geq 0}   is the Hankel transform of the sequence     {   b  n   }    n  ≥  0      subscript    subscript  b  n      n  0     \{b_{n}\}_{n\geq 0}   when        h  n   =   det    (   b    i  +  j   -  2    )     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤   n  +  1        .       subscript  h  n      subscript   subscript  b      i  j   2     formulae-sequence    1  i     j    n  1         h_{n}=\det(b_{i+j-2})_{1\leq i,j\leq n+1}.     Here,     a   i  ,  j    =   b    i  +  j   -  2         subscript  a   i  j     subscript  b      i  j   2      a_{i,j}=b_{i+j-2}   is the Hankel matrix of the sequence    {   b  n   }      subscript  b  n     \{b_{n}\}   . The Hankel transform is invariant under the binomial transform of a sequence. That is, if one writes       c  n   =    ∑   k  =  0   n     (     n      k     )    b  k          subscript  c  n     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      binomial  n  k    subscript  b  k       c_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose k}b_{k}     as the binomial transform of the sequence    {   b  n   }      subscript  b  n     \{b_{n}\}   , then one has        det    (   b    i  +  j   -  2    )     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤   n  +  1       =   det    (   c    i  +  j   -  2    )     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤   n  +  1        .         subscript   subscript  b      i  j   2     formulae-sequence    1  i     j    n  1          subscript   subscript  c      i  j   2     formulae-sequence    1  i     j    n  1         \det(b_{i+j-2})_{1\leq i,j\leq n+1}=\det(c_{i+j-2})_{1\leq i,j\leq n+1}.     Hankel matrices for system identification  Hankel matrices are formed when given a sequence of output data and a realization of an underlying state-space or hidden Markov model is desired. The singular value decomposition of the Hankel matrix provides a means of computing the A, B, and C matrices which define the state-space realization.

For example the reflection matrix of order   5   5   5   is as follows:      J  5   =   [                 1               1               1               1               1                 ]    .       subscript  J  5     absent  absent  absent  absent  1    absent  absent  absent  1  absent    absent  absent  1  absent  absent    absent  1  absent  absent  absent    1  absent  absent  absent  absent      J_{5}=\begin{bmatrix}&&&&1\\
