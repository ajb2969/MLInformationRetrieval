OBD-II PIDs

OBD-II PIDs (On-board diagnostics Parameter IDs) are codes used to request data from a vehicle, used as a diagnostic tool.
SAE standard J/1979 defines many PIDs, but manufacturers also define many more PIDs specific to their vehicles. All light duty vehicles (i.e. less than 8,500 pounds) sold in North America since 1996, as well as medium duty vehicles (i.e. 8,500-14,000 pounds) beginning in 2005, and heavy duty vehicles (i.e. greater than 14,000 pounds) beginning in 2010,1 are required to support OBD-II diagnostics, using a standardized data link connector, and a subset of the SAE J/1979 defined PIDs (or SAE J/1939 as applicable for medium/heavy duty vehicles), primarily for state mandated emissions inspections.
Typically, an automotive technician will use PIDs with a scan tool connected to the vehicle's OBD-II connector.

The technician enters the PID
The scan tool sends it to the vehicle's controller–area network (CAN)-bus, VPW, PWM, ISO, KWP. (After 2008, CAN only)
A device on the bus recognizes the PID as one it is responsible for, and reports the value for that PID to the bus
The scan tool reads the response, and displays it to the technician

Modes
There are ten modes of operation described in the latest OBD-II standard SAE J1979. They are as follows:




Mode (hex)

Description





01

Show current data



02

Show freeze frame data



03

Show stored Diagnostic Trouble Codes



04

Clear Diagnostic Trouble Codes and stored values



05

Test results, oxygen sensor monitoring (non CAN only)



06

Test results, other component/system monitoring (Test results, oxygen sensor monitoring for CAN only)



07

Show pending Diagnostic Trouble Codes (detected during current or last driving cycle)



08

Control operation of on-board component/system



09

Request vehicle information



0A

Permanent Diagnostic Trouble Codes (DTCs) (Cleared DTCs)



Vehicle manufacturers are not required to support all modes. Each manufacturer may define additional modes above #9 (e.g.: mode 22 as defined by SAE J2190 for Ford/GM, mode 21 for Toyota) for other information e.g. the voltage of the traction battery in a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV).2
Standard PIDs
The table below shows the standard OBD-II PIDs as defined by SAE J1979. The expected response for each PID is given, along with information on how to translate the response into meaningful data. Again, not all vehicles will support all PIDs and there can be manufacturer-defined custom PIDs that are not defined in the OBD-II standard.
Note that modes 1 and 2 are basically identical, except that Mode 1 provides current information, whereas Mode 2 provides a snapshot of the same data taken at the point when the last diagnostic trouble code was set. The exceptions are PID 01, which is only available in Mode 1, and PID 02, which is only available in Mode 2. If Mode 2 PID 02 returns zero, then there is no snapshot and all other Mode 2 data is meaningless.
When using Bit-Encoded-Notation, quantities like C4 means bit 4 from data byte C. Each bit is numerated from 0 to 7, so 7 is the most significant bit and 0 is the least significant bit.

Bitwise encoded PIDs
Some of the PIDs in the above table cannot be explained with a simple formula. A more elaborate explanation of these data is provided here:
Mode 1 PID 00
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data. Each bit, from MSB to LSB, represents one of the next 32 PIDs and is giving information about if it is supported.
For example, if the car response is BE1FA813, it can be decoded like this:

So, supported PIDs are: 01, 03, 04, 05, 06, 07, 0C, 0D, 0E, 0F, 10, 11, 13, 15, 1C, 1F and 20
Mode 1 PID 01
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data, labeled A B C and D.
The first byte(A) contains two pieces of information. Bit A7 (MSB of byte A, the first byte) indicates whether or not the MIL (check engine light) is illuminated. Bits A6 through A0 represent the number of diagnostic trouble codes currently flagged in the ECU.
The second, third, and fourth bytes(B, C and D) give information about the availability and completeness of certain on-board tests. Note that test availability is indicated by set (1) bit and completeness is indicated by reset (0) bit.




Bit

A7

MIL

Off or On, indicates if the CEL/MIL is on (or should be on)



A6-A0

DTC_CNT

Number of confirmed emissions-related DTCs available for display.



B7

Mode 1 PID 41
A request for this PID returns 4 bytes of data. The first byte is always zero. The second, third, and fourth bytes give information about the availability and completeness of certain on-board tests. Note that test availability is represented by a set (1) bit and completeness is represented by a reset (0) bit:

Mode 1 PID 78
A request for this PID will return 9 bytes of data. The first byte is a bit encoded field indicating which EGT sensors are supported:

Description





A

Supported EGT sensors



B-C

Temperature read by EGT11



D-E

Temperature read by EGT12



F-G

Temperature read by EGT13



H-I

The first byte is bit-encoded as follows:




Bit

Description





A7-A4

Reserved



A3

EGT bank 1, sensor 4 Supported?



A2

EGT bank 1, sensor 3 Supported?



A1

EGT bank 1, sensor 2 Supported?



A0

EGT bank 1, sensor 1 Supported?



The remaining bytes are 16 bit integers indicating the temperature in degrees Celsius in the range -40 to 6513.5 (scale 0.1), using the usual 
 
 
 
  formula (MSB is A, LSB is B). Only values for which the corresponding sensor is supported are meaningful.
The same structure applies to PID 79, but values are for sensors of bank 2.
Mode 3 (no PID required)
A request for this mode returns a list of the DTCs that have been set. The list is encapsulated using the ISO 15765-2 protocol.
If there are two or fewer DTCs (4 bytes) they are returned in an ISO-TP Single Frame (SF). Three or more DTCs in the list are reported in multiple frames, with the exact count of frames dependent on the communication type and addressing details.
Each trouble code requires 2 bytes to describe. The text description of a trouble code may be decoded as follows. The first character in the trouble code is determined by the first two bits in the first byte:




A7-A6

First DTC character





00

'''P''' - Powertrain



01

'''C''' - Chassis



10

'''B''' - Body



11

'''U''' - Network



The two following digits are encoded as 2 bits. The second character in the DTC is a number defined by the following table:




A5-A4

Second DTC character





00

The fourth and fifth characters are defined in the same way as the third, but using bits B7-B4 and B3-B0. The resulting five-character code should look something like "U0158" and can be looked up in a table of OBD-II DTCs. Hexadecimal characters (0-9, A-F), while relatively rare, are allowed in the last 3 positions of the code itself.
Mode 9 PID 08
It provides information about track in-use performance for catalyst banks, oxygen sensor banks, evaporative leak detection systems, EGR systems and secondary air system.
The numerator for each component or system tracks the number of times that all conditions necessary for a specific monitor to detect a malfunction have been encountered. The denominator for each component or system tracks the number of times that the vehicle has been operated in the specified conditions.
All data items of the In-use Performance Tracking record consist of two (2) bytes and are reported in this order (each message contains two items, hence the message length is 4):

Non-standard PIDs
The majority of all OBD-II PIDs in use are non-standard. For most modern vehicles, there are many more functions supported on the OBD-II interface than are covered by the standard PIDs, and there is relatively minor overlap between vehicle manufacturers for these non-standard PIDs.
There is very limited information available in the public domain for non-standard PIDs. The primary source of information on non-standard PIDs across different manufacturers is maintained by the US-based Equipment and Tool Institute and only available to members. The price of ETI membership for access to scan codes varies based on company size defined by annual sales of automotive tools and equipment in North America:




Annual Sales in North America

Annual Dues





Under $10,000,0000

$5,000



$10,000,000 - $50,000,000

$7,500



Greater than $50,000,000

$10,000



However, even ETI membership will not provide full documentation for non-standard PIDs. ETI state: 
showing cost of access to OBD-II PID documentation
3

Some OEMs refuse to use ETI as a one-stop source of scan tool information. They prefer to do business with each tool company separately. These companies also require that you enter into a contract with them. The charges vary but here is a snapshot as of April 13th, 2015 of the per year charges:




GM

$50,000



Honda

$5,000



Suzuki

$1,000



BMW

$25,500 plus $2,000 per update. Updates occur annually.




CAN (11-bit) bus format
The PID query and response occurs on the vehicle's CAN bus. Standard OBD requests and responses use functional addresses. The diagnostic reader initiates a query using CAN ID $7DF, which acts as a broadcast address, and accepts responses from any ID in the range $7E8 to $7EF. ECUs that can respond to OBD queries listen both to the functional broadcast ID of $7DF and one assigned ID in the range $7E0 to $7E7. Their response has an ID of their assigned ID plus 8 e.g. $7E8 through $7EF.
This approach allows up to eight ECUs, each independently responding to OBD queries. The diagnostic reader can use the ID in the ECU response frame to continue communication with a specific ECU. In particular, multi-frame communication requires a response to the specific ECU ID rather than to ID $7DF.
CAN bus may also be used for communication beyond the standard OBD messages. Physical addressing uses particular CAN IDs for specific modules (e.g., 720 for the instrument cluster in Fords) with proprietary frame payloads.
Query
The functional PID query is sent to the vehicle on the CAN bus at ID 7DFh, using 8 data bytes. The bytes are:





Byte

SAE Standard

 data bytes:
 2



Vehicle specific

Response
The vehicle responds to the PID query on the CAN bus with message IDs that depend on which module responded. Typically the engine or main ECU responds at ID 7E8h. Other modules, like the hybrid controller or battery controller in a Prius, respond at 07E9h, 07EAh, 07EBh, etc. These are 8h higher than the physical address the module responds to. Even though the number of bytes in the returned value is variable, the message uses 8 data bytes regardless (CAN bus protocol form Frameformat with 8 data bytes). The bytes are:
