Beta-dual space

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, the beta-dual or 

 
 -dual is a certain linear subspace of the algebraic dual of a sequence space.
Definition
Given a sequence space 
 
 
 
  the 

 
 -dual of 
 
 
 
  is defined as



If 
 
 
 
  is an FK-space then each 
 
 
 
  in  defines a continuous linear form on 
 
 




Examples











Properties
The beta-dual of an FK-space 
 
 
 
  is a linear subspace of the continuous dual of 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is an FK-AK space then the beta dual is linear isomorphic to the continuous dual.
