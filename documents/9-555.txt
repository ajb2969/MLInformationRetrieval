   Pushforward measure      Pushforward measure   In measure theory , a pushforward measure (also push forward , push-forward or image measure ) is obtained by transferring ("pushing forward") a measure from one measurable space to another using a measurable function .  Definition  Given measurable spaces ( X 1 , Σ 1 ) and ( X 2 , Σ 2 ), a measurable mapping f : X 1 → X 2 and a measure μ : Σ 1 → [0, +∞], the pushforward of μ is defined to be the measure f ∗ ( μ ) : Σ 2 → [0, +∞] given by         (    f  *    (  μ  )    )    (  B  )    =   μ   (    f   -  1     (  B  )    )   for  B   ∈   Σ  2    .             subscript  f    μ   B     μ     superscript  f    1    B   for  B         subscript  normal-Σ  2      (f_{*}(\mu))(B)=\mu\left(f^{-1}(B)\right)\mbox{ for }B\in\Sigma_{2}.     This definition applies mutatis mutandis for a signed or complex measure .  Main property: Change of variables formula  Theorem: 1 A measurable function g on X 2 is integrable with respect to the pushforward measure f ∗ ( μ ) if and only if the composition    g  ∘  f      g  f    g\circ f   is integrable with respect to the measure μ . In that case, the integrals coincide, i.e.,         ∫   X  2      g   d   (    f  *   μ   )     =    ∫   X  1      g  ∘   f    d  μ     .        subscript    subscript  X  2      g  d     subscript  f    μ       subscript    subscript  X  1        g  f   d  μ      \int_{X_{2}}g\,d(f_{*}\mu)=\int_{X_{1}}g\circ f\,d\mu.     Examples and applications   A natural " Lebesgue measure " on the unit circle  S 1 (here thought of as a subset of the complex plane  C ) may be defined using a push-forward construction and Lebesgue measure λ on the real line  R . Let λ also denote the restriction of Lebesgue measure to the interval [0, 2 π ) and let f : [0, 2 π ) → S 1 be the natural bijection defined by f ( t ) = exp( i  t ). The natural "Lebesgue measure" on S 1 is then the push-forward measure f ∗ ( λ ). The measure f ∗ ( λ ) might also be called " arc length measure" or "angle measure", since the f ∗ ( λ )-measure of an arc in S 1 is precisely its arc length (or, equivalently, the angle that it subtends at the centre of the circle.)    The previous example extends nicely to give a natural "Lebesgue measure" on the n -dimensional torus  T n . The previous example is a special case, since S 1 = T 1 . This Lebesgue measure on T n is, up to normalization, the Haar measure for the compact , connected  Lie group  T n .    Gaussian measures on infinite-dimensional vector spaces are defined using the push-forward and the standard Gaussian measure on the real line: a Borel measure  γ on a separable  Banach space  X is called Gaussian if the push-forward of γ by any non-zero linear functional in the continuous dual space to X is a Gaussian measure on R .    Consider a measurable function f : X → X and the composition of f with itself n times:            f   (  n  )    =     f  ∘  f  ∘  …  ∘  f   ⏟     n   times     :   X  →  X    .     normal-:     superscript  f  n    subscript   normal-⏟    f  f  normal-…  f      n  times      normal-→  X  X     f^{(n)}=\underbrace{f\circ f\circ\dots\circ f}_{n\mathrm{\,times}}:X\to X.         This iterated function forms a dynamical system . It is often of interest in the study of such systems to find a measure μ on X that the map f leaves unchanged, a so-called invariant measure , one for which f ∗ ( μ ) = μ .    One can also consider quasi-invariant measures for such a dynamical system: a measure μ on X is called quasi-invariant under f if the push-forward of μ by f is merely equivalent to the original measure μ , not necessarily equal to it.   A generalization  In general, any measurable function can be pushed forward, the push-forward then becomes a linear operator , known as the transfer operator or Frobenius–Perron operator . This operator typically satisfies the requirements of the Frobenius–Perron theorem , and the maximal eigenvalue of this theorem corresponds to the invariant measure. The adjoint to the push-forward is the pullback ; as an operator on measurable spaces, it is the composition operator or Koopman operator .
