   Born series      Born series   The Born series 1 is the expansion of different scattering quantities in quantum scattering theory in the powers of the interaction potential   V   V   V   (more precisely in powers of      G  0   V   ,       subscript  G  0   V    G_{0}V,   where    G  0     subscript  G  0    G_{0}   is the free particle Green's operator ). It is closely related to Born approximation , which is the first order term of the Born series. The series can formally be understood as power series introducing the coupling constant by substitution    V  →   λ  V      normal-→  V    λ  V     V\to\lambda V   . The speed of convergence and radius of convergence of the Born series are related to eigenvalues of the operator     G  0   V       subscript  G  0   V    G_{0}V   . In general the first few terms of the Born series are good approximation to the expanded quantity for "weak" interaction   V   V   V   and large collision energy.  Born series for scattering states  The Born series for the scattering states reads       |  ψ  ⟩   =    |  ϕ  ⟩   +    G  0    (  E  )   V   |  ϕ  ⟩    +     [    G  0    (  E  )   V   ]   2    |  ϕ  ⟩    +     [    G  0    (  E  )   V   ]   3    |  ϕ  ⟩    +  …        ket  ψ      ket  ϕ      subscript  G  0   E  V   ket  ϕ       superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  G  0   E  V    2    ket  ϕ       superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  G  0   E  V    3    ket  ϕ    normal-…     |\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+G_{0}(E)V|\phi\rangle+[G_{0}(E)V]^{2}|\phi\rangle+[G%
 _{0}(E)V]^{3}|\phi\rangle+\dots   It can be derived by iterating the Lippmann–Schwinger equation        |  ψ  ⟩   =    |  ϕ  ⟩   +    G  0    (  E  )   V   |  ψ  ⟩      .       ket  ψ      ket  ϕ      subscript  G  0   E  V   ket  ψ       |\psi\rangle=|\phi\rangle+G_{0}(E)V|\psi\rangle.   Note that the Green's operator     G  0     subscript  G  0    G_{0}   for free partice can be retarded/advanced or standing wave operator for retarded    |   ψ   (  +  )    ⟩     ket   superscript  ψ      |\psi^{(+)}\rangle   advanced    |   ψ   (  -  )    ⟩     ket   superscript  ψ      |\psi^{(-)}\rangle   or standing wave scattering states    |   ψ   (  P  )    ⟩     ket   superscript  ψ  P     |\psi^{(P)}\rangle   . The first iteration is obtained by replacing the full scattering solution    |  ψ  ⟩     ket  ψ    |\psi\rangle   with free particle wave function    |  ϕ  ⟩     ket  ϕ    |\phi\rangle   on the right hand side of the Lippmann-Schwinger equation and it gives the first Born approximation . The second iteration substitutes the first Born approximation in the right hand side and the result is called the second Born approximation. In general the n-th Born approximation takes n-terms of the series into account. The second Born approximation is sometimes used, when the first Born approximation vanishes, but the higher terms are rarely used. The Born series can formally be summed as geometric series with the common ratio equal to the operator     G  0   V       subscript  G  0   V    G_{0}V   , giving the formal solution to Lippmann-Schwinger equation in the form        |  ψ  ⟩   =     [   I  -    G  0    (  E  )   V    ]    -  1     |  ϕ  ⟩    =     [   V  -   V   G  0    (  E  )   V    ]    -  1    V   |  ϕ  ⟩     .         ket  ψ      superscript   delimited-[]    I     subscript  G  0   E  V       1     ket  ϕ            superscript   delimited-[]    V    V   subscript  G  0   E  V       1    V   ket  ϕ       |\psi\rangle=[I-G_{0}(E)V]^{-1}|\phi\rangle=[V-VG_{0}(E)V]^{-1}V|\phi\rangle.     Born series for T-matrix  The Born series can also be written for other scattering quantities like the T-matrix which is closely related to the scattering amplitude . Iterating Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the T-matrix we get       T   (  E  )    =   V  +   V   G  0    (  E  )   V   +   V    [    G  0    (  E  )   V   ]   2    +   V    [    G  0    (  E  )   V   ]   3    +  …         T  E     V    V   subscript  G  0   E  V     V   superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  G  0   E  V    2      V   superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  G  0   E  V    3    normal-…     T(E)=V+VG_{0}(E)V+V[G_{0}(E)V]^{2}+V[G_{0}(E)V]^{3}+\dots   For the T-matrix    G  0     subscript  G  0    G_{0}   stands only for retarded Green's operator      G  0   (  +  )     (  E  )        superscript   subscript  G  0     E    G_{0}^{(+)}(E)   . The standing wave Green's operator would give the K-matrix instead.  Born series for full Green's operator  The Lippmann-Schwinger equation for Green's operator is called the resolvent identity ,        G   (  E  )    =     G  0    (  E  )    +    G  0    (  E  )   V  G   (  E  )      .        G  E        subscript  G  0   E      subscript  G  0   E  V  G  E      G(E)=G_{0}(E)+G_{0}(E)VG(E).   Its solution by iteration leads to the Born series for the full Green's operator     G   (  E  )    =    (    E  -  H   +   i  ϵ    )    -  1          G  E    superscript      E  H     i  ϵ      1      G(E)=(E-H+i\epsilon)^{-1}          G   (  E  )    =     G  0    (  E  )    +    G  0    (  E  )   V   G  0    (  E  )    +     [    G  0    (  E  )   V   ]   2    G  0    (  E  )    +     [    G  0    (  E  )   V   ]   3    G  0    (  E  )    +  …         G  E        subscript  G  0   E      subscript  G  0   E  V   subscript  G  0   E      superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  G  0   E  V    2    subscript  G  0   E      superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  G  0   E  V    3    subscript  G  0   E   normal-…     G(E)=G_{0}(E)+G_{0}(E)VG_{0}(E)+[G_{0}(E)V]^{2}G_{0}(E)+[G_{0}(E)V]^{3}G_{0}(E%
