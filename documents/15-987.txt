Dimethyl sulfide:cytochrome c2 reductase

Dimethyl sulfide:cytochrome c2 reductase (, Ddh (gene)) is an enzyme with system name dimethyl sulfide:cytochrome-c2 oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

dimethyl sulfide + 2 ferricytochrome c2 + H2O 
 
 
dimethyl sulfoxide + 2 ferrocytochrome c2 + 2 H+


The enzyme from the bacterium Rhodovulum sulfidophilum binds molybdopterin guanine dinucleotide, heme b and [4Fe-4S] clusters.
