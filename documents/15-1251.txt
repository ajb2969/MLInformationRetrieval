   16S rRNA (adenine1518-N6/adenine1519-N6)-dimethyltransferase      16S rRNA (adenine1518-N6/adenine1519-N6)-dimethyltransferase   16S rRNA (adenine 1518 -N 6 /adenine 1519 -N 6 )-dimethyltransferase (, S-adenosylmethionine-6-N',N'-adenosyl (rRNA) dimethyltransferase , KsgA , ksgA methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (adenine 1518 -N 6 /adenine 1519 -N 6 )-dimethyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   4 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 1518 / adenine 1519 in 16S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4 Ribosomal RNA + N 6 -dimethyladenine 1518 /N 6 -dimethyladenine 1519 in 16S rRNA   KsgA introduces the dimethylation of adenine 1518 and adenine 1519 in 16S rRNA. Strains lacking the methylase are resistant to kasugamycin [1].  References  External links     "  Category:EC 2.1.1     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
