16S rRNA (adenine1518-N6/adenine1519-N6)-dimethyltransferase

16S rRNA (adenine1518-N6/adenine1519-N6)-dimethyltransferase (, S-adenosylmethionine-6-N',N'-adenosyl (rRNA) dimethyltransferase, KsgA, ksgA methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (adenine1518-N6/adenine1519-N6)-dimethyltransferase.12345678 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

4 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine1518/adenine1519 in 16S rRNA

 
  4 Ribosomal RNA + N6-dimethyladenine1518/N6-dimethyladenine1519 in 16S rRNA
 

KsgA introduces the dimethylation of adenine1518 and adenine1519 in 16S rRNA. Strains lacking the methylase are resistant to kasugamycin [1].
