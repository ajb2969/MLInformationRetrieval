   TRNA (cytidine32/guanosine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase      TRNA (cytidine32/guanosine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase   TRNA (cytidine 32 /guanosine 34 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, Trm7p ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytidine32/guanosine34-2'-O)-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine 32 / guanosine 34 in tRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine 32 /2'-O-methylguanosine 34 in tRNA   The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae catalyses the formation of 2'-O-methylnucleotides at positions 32 and 34 of the yeast tRNAPhe and tRNATrp.
