   Kobon triangle problem      Kobon triangle problem   (Figure)  Kobon triangles generated with 3, 4 and 5 straight line segments.   The Kobon triangle problem is an unsolved problem in combinatorial geometry first stated by Kobon Fujimura . The problem asks for the largest number N ( k ) of nonoverlapping triangles whose sides lie on an arrangement of k lines . Variations of the problem consider the projective plane rather than the Euclidean plane, and require that the triangles not be crossed by any other lines of the arrangement. 1  Saburo Tamura proved that the largest integer not exceeding k ( k − 2)/3 provides an upper bound on the maximal number of nonoverlapping triangles realizable by k lines. 2 In 2007, a tighter upper bound was found by Johannes Bader and Gilles Clément, by proving that Tamura's upper bound couldn't be reached for any k congruent to 0 or 2 (mod 6). 3 The maximum number of triangles is therefore one less than Tamura's bound in these cases. Perfect solutions (Kobon triangle solutions yielding the maximum number of triangles) are known for k = 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 13, 15 and 17. 4 For k = 10, 11 and 12, the best solutions known reach a number of triangles one less than the upper bound.  Given a perfect solution with k 0 lines, other Kobon triangle solution numbers can be found for all k i -values where        k   n  +  1    =    2  ⋅   k  n    -  1    ,       subscript  k    n  1       normal-⋅  2   subscript  k  n    1     k_{n+1}=2\cdot k_{n}-1,\!\,   by using the procedure by D. Forge and J. L. Ramirez Alfonsin. 5 6 For example, the solution for k 0 = 3 leads to the maximal number of nonoverlapping triangles for k = 3,5,9,17,33,65,...  {{-}}      k   3   4   5   6   7   8   9   10   11   12   13   14   15   16   17   18   19   20   21   OEIS     Tamura's upper bound on N ( k )   1   2   5   8   11   16   21   26   33   40   47   56   65   74   85   96   107   120   133      Clément and Bader's upper bound   1   2   5   7   11   15   21   26   33   39   47   55   65   74   85   95   107   119   133   -     best known solution   1   2   5   7   11   15   21   25   32   38   47   53   65   72   85   93   104   115   130      Examples  Image:KobonTriangle_3.svg|3 straight lines result in one triangle Image:KobonTriangle_4.svg|4 straight lines Image:KobonTriangle_5.svg|5 straight lines Image:KobonTriangle_6.svg|6 straight lines Image:KobonTriangle_7.svg|7 straight lines  References  External links   Johannes Bader, "Kobon Triangles"   "  Category:Discrete geometry  Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics  Category:Recreational mathematics  Category:Triangles     . ↩  ↩  G.
