   S-methyl-5-thioribose kinase      S-methyl-5-thioribose kinase   In enzymology , a S-methyl-5-thioribose kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribose , whereas its two products are ADP and S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:S-methylmethyl-5-thio-D-ribose 1-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include 5-methylthioribose kinase (phosphorylating) , methylthioribose kinase , 5-methylthioribose kinase , and ATP:S5-methyl-5-thio-D-ribose 1-phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
