Clausius–Mossotti relation

The Clausius–Mossotti relation is named after the Italian physicist Ottaviano-Fabrizio Mossotti, whose 1850 book1 analyzed the relationship between the dielectric constants of two different media, and the German physicist Rudolf Clausius, who gave the formula explicitly in his 1879 book2 in the context not of dielectric constants but of indices of refraction. The same formula also arises in the context of conductivity, in which it is known as Maxwell's formula. It arises yet again in the context of refractivity, in which it is known as the Lorentz–Lorenz equation.
The Clausius–Mossotti law applies to the dielectric constant of a dielectric that is perfect, homogeneous and isotropic. It is the second of the following three equalities:34



where



 
  is the dielectric constant of a substance


 
  is the permittivity of a vacuum


 
  is the molar mass of the substance


 
  is its density


 
  is Avogadro's number,


 
  is the molecular polarizability in SI-units (C·m2/V) and


 
  is the molecular polarizability volume (m3 in SI) or the polarizability in the CGS system of units.5

Clausius–Mossotti factor
The Clausius–Mossotti factor can be expressed in terms of complex permittivities:678






where



 
  is the permittivity (the subscript p refers to a lossless dielectric sphere suspended in a medium m)


 
  is the conductivity


 
  is the angular frequency of the applied electric field
i is the imaginary unit, the square root of -1

In the context of electrokinetic manipulation, the real part of the Clausius–Mossotti factor is a determining factor for the dielectrophoretic force on a particle, whereas the imaginary part is a determining factor for the electrorotational torque on the particle. Other factors are, of course, the geometries of the particle to be manipulated and the electric field. Whereas 
 
 
 
  can be directly measured by application of different AC potentials directly on electrodes,9

 
  can be measured by electro-rotation measurements thanks to optical trapping methods.
Derivation
Assume a simple cubic lattice of polarisable points with polarisability 
 
 
 
 . Application of an external field 
 
 
 
  will induce a dipole at each site 
 
 
 
 . Due to symmetry, the local (microscopic) field inside lattice is identical at each lattice point
 
 
 
 .
Away from the lattice points, the electric field is given by:

Richard Feynman on the Clausius–Mossotti equation
In his Lectures on Physics (Vol.2, Ch32), Richard Feynman has a background discussion deriving the Clausius–Mossotti Equation, in reference to the index of refraction for dense materials. He starts with the derivation of an equation for the index of refraction for gases, and then shows how this must be modified for dense materials, modifying it, because in dense materials, there are also electric fields produced by other nearby atoms, creating local fields. In essence, Feynman is saying that for dense materials the polarization of a material is proportional to its electric field, but that it has a different constant of proportionality than that for a gas. When this constant is corrected for a dense material, by taking into account the local fields of nearby atoms, one ends up with the Clausius–Mossotti Equation.10 Feynman states the Clausius–Mossotti equation as follows:


 
  ,
where
:* 
 
 
 
  is the number of particles per unit volume of the capacitor,
:* 
 
 
 
  is the atomic polarizability,
:* 
 
 
 
  is the refractive index.
Feynman discusses "atomic polarizability" and explains it in these terms: When there is a sinusoidal electric field acting on a material, there is an induced dipole moment per unit volume which is proportional to the electric field - with a proportionality constant 
 
 
 
  that depends on the frequency. This constant is a complex number, meaning that the polarization does not exactly follow the electric field, but may be shifted in phase to some extent. At any rate, there is a polarization per unit volume whose magnitude is proportional to the strength of the electric field.
Dielectric constant and polarizability
The polarizability 
 
 
 
 , of an atom is defined in terms of the local electric field at the atom by



where
:* 
 
 
 
  is the dipole moment,
:* 
 
 
 
  is the local electric field at the orbital
The polarizability is an atomic property, but the dielectric constant will depend on the manner in which the atoms are assembled to form a crystal. For a non-spherical atom, 
 
 
 
  will be a tensor.11
The polarization of a crystal may be expressed approximately as the product of the polarizabilities of the atoms times the local electric field:
Now, to relate the dielectric constant to the polarizability, which is what the Clausius–Mossotti equation (or relation) is all about,12 one must consider that the results will depend on the relation that holds between the macroscopic electric field and the local electric field:



where
:* 
 
 
 
  is the concentration,
:* 
 
 
 
  is the polarizability of atoms j,
:*
