   Bromoxynil nitrilase      Bromoxynil nitrilase   In enzymology , a bromoxynil nitrilase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzoate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxy-benzoate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in nitriles. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,5-dibromo-4-hydroxybenzonitrile aminohydrolase . This enzyme participates in 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation .
