Diphenylphosphine

Diphenylphosphine, also known as diphenylphosphane, is an organophosphorus compound with the formula (C6H5)2PH. This foul-smelling, colorless liquid is easily oxidized in air. It is a precursor to organophosphorus ligands for use as catalysts.
Synthesis
Diphenylphosphine can be prepared cheaply from triphenylphosphine.1

PPh3 + 2 Li → LiPPh2 + LiPh
 
LiPPh2 + H2O → Ph2PH + LiOH
 

Uses and reactions
In the laboratory, diphenylphosphine is a common intermediate. It can be deprotonated to give diphenylphosphide derivatives:2

Ph2PH + nBuLi → Ph2PLi + nBuH
 

The preparation of phosphine ligands, Wittig-Horner reagents, and phosphonium salts are commonly accomplished by alkylating diphenylphosphine. The hydrogen atom connected to phosphorus undergoes Michael-like addition to activated alkenes, providing products with which to produce phosphine ligands such as 1,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)ethane (Ph2PC2H4PPh2). Diphenylphosphine and especially diphenylphosphide derivatives are nucleophiles, so they add to carbon – heteroatom double bonds.3 For example, in the presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid at 100 °C, diphenylphosphine adds to the carbon atom in benzaldehyde to give (phenyl-(phenylmethyl)phosphoryl)benzene.

Ph2PH + PhCHO → Ph2P(O)CH2Ph
 

Compared to tertiary phosphines, diphenylphosphine is weakly basic. The pKa of the protonated derivative is 0.03:4

Ph2PH2+

 
  Ph2PH + H+


Handling properties
During the handling of diphenylphosphine, care must be taken to avoid oxidation of diphenylphosphine.5

Ph2PH + O2 → Ph2P(O)OH
 

The use of the diphenylphosphine–borane complex, Ph2PH•BH3 avoids the problem of phosphine oxidation by protecting the phosphine from oxidation and is available through chemical vendors.6
