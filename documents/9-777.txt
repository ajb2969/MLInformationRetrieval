   Ragsdale conjecture      Ragsdale conjecture   The Ragsdale conjecture is a mathematical  conjecture that concerns the possible arrangements of real algebraic curves embedded in the projective plane . It was proposed by Virginia Ragsdale several years after 1900 and was disproved in 1979.  Background  Her dissertation dealt with Hilbert's sixteenth problem , which was proposed in the year 1900, along with 22 other unsolved problems of the 19th century . Ragsdale conjectured a particular upper bound on the number of topological circles of a certain type, along with the basis of evidence. The conjecture was held of high importance in the field of real algebraic geometry for nearly a century. Later Oleg Viro 1 and Ilya Itenberg 2 produced counterexamples to the Ragsdale conjecture, although the problem of finding a sharp upper bound remains unsolved.  Conjecture  Ragsdale's main conjecture is as follows.  Assume that an algebraic curve of degree 2 k contains p even and n odd ovals. Ragsdale conjectured that        p  ≤       3  2    k   (   k  -  1   )    +  1   and     n  ≤     3  2    k   (   k  -  1   )      .     formulae-sequence    p         3  2   k    k  1    1   and      n      3  2   k    k  1       p\leq\tfrac{3}{2}k(k-1)+1\quad\text{and}\quad n\leq\tfrac{3}{2}k(k-1).     She also posed the inequality        |    2   (   p  -  n   )    -  1   |   ≤     3   k  2    -   3  k    +  1    ,            2    p  n    1          3   superscript  k  2      3  k    1     |2(p-n)-1|\leq 3k^{2}-3k+1,     and showed that the inequality could not be further improved. This inequality was later proved by Petrovsky .  Notes    References     "  Category:Disproved conjectures  Category:Real algebraic geometry     Translated in ↩  ↩
