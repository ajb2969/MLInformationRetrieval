   Pullback bundle      Pullback bundle   In mathematics , a pullback bundle or induced bundle 1 2 3 is a useful construction in the theory of fiber bundles . Given a fiber bundle π : E → B and a continuous map  f : B ′ → B one can define a "pullback" of E by f as a bundle f * E over B ′. The fiber of f * E over a point b ′ in B ′ is just the fiber of E over f ( b ′). Thus f * E is the disjoint union of all these fibers equipped with a suitable topology .  Formal definition  Let π : E → B be a fiber bundle with abstract fiber F and let f : B ′ → B be a continuous map . Define the pullback bundle by        f  *   E   =   {    (   b  ′   ,  e  )   ∈    B  ′   ×  E    ∣    f   (   b  ′   )    =   π   (  e  )     }   ⊂    B  ′   ×  E            superscript  f    E    conditional-set      superscript  b  normal-′   e      superscript  B  normal-′   E        f   superscript  b  normal-′      π  e             superscript  B  normal-′   E      f^{*}E=\{(b^{\prime},e)\in B^{\prime}\times E\mid f(b^{\prime})=\pi(e)\}%
 \subset B^{\prime}\times E   and equip it with the subspace topology and the projection map  π ′ : f * E → B ′ given by the projection onto the first factor, i.e.,         π  ′    (   b  ′   ,  e  )    =   b  ′    .         superscript  π  normal-′     superscript  b  normal-′   e     superscript  b  normal-′     \pi^{\prime}(b^{\prime},e)=b^{\prime}.\,   The projection onto the second factor gives a map     f  ~   :     f  *   E   →  E      normal-:   normal-~  f    normal-→     superscript  f    E   E     \tilde{f}\colon f^{*}E\to E   such that the following diagram commutes :    \begin{array} {ccc}     f^{\ast}E & \stackrel {\tilde f} {\longrightarrow} & E\\ {\pi}' \downarrow & & \downarrow \pi\\ B' & \stackrel f {\longrightarrow} & B \end{array}  If ( U , φ) is a local trivialization of E then ( f −1 U , ψ) is a local trivialization of f * E where        ψ   (   b  ′   ,  e  )    =   (   b  ′   ,    proj  2    (   φ   (  e  )    )    )    .        ψ    superscript  b  normal-′   e      superscript  b  normal-′      subscript  proj  2     φ  e       \psi(b^{\prime},e)=(b^{\prime},\mbox{proj}_{2}(\varphi(e))).\,   It then follows that f * E is a fiber bundle over B ′ with fiber F . The bundle f * E is called the '''pullback of E by f ''' or the bundle induced by f . The map    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   is then a bundle morphism covering f .  Properties  Any section  s of E over B induces a section of f * E , called the pullback section  f * s , simply by defining      f  *   s   =   s  ∘  f          superscript  f    s     s  f     f^{*}s=s\circ f   .  If the bundle E → B has structure group  G with transition functions t ij (with respect to a family of local trivializations {( U i , φ i )} ) then the pullback bundle f * E also has structure group G . The transition functions in f * E are given by         f  *    t   i  j     =    t   i  j    ∘  f    .         superscript  f     subscript  t    i  j        subscript  t    i  j    f     f^{*}t_{ij}=t_{ij}\circ f.     If E → B is a vector bundle or principal bundle then so is the pullback f * E . In the case of a principal bundle the right action of G on f * E is given by        (  x  ,  e  )   ⋅  g   =   (  x  ,   e  ⋅  g   )        normal-⋅   x  e   g    x   normal-⋅  e  g      (x,e)\cdot g=(x,e\cdot g)   It then follows that the map    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   is equivariant and so defines a morphism of principal bundles.  In the language of category theory , the pullback bundle construction is an example of the more general categorical pullback . As such it satisfies the corresponding universal property .  The construction of the pullback bundle can be carried out in subcategories of the category of topological spaces , such as the category of smooth manifolds . The latter construction is useful in differential geometry and topology  Examples: It is illuminating to consider the pullback of the degree 2 map from the circle to itself over the degree 3 or 4 map from the circle to itself. In such examples one sometimes gets a connected and sometimes disconnected space, but always several copies of the circle.  Bundles and sheaves  Bundles may also be described by their sheaves of sections . The pullback of bundles then corresponds to the inverse image of sheaves , which is a contravariant functor. A sheaf, however, is more naturally a covariant object, since it has a pushforward , called the direct image of a sheaf . The tension and interplay between bundles and sheaves, or inverse and direct image, can be advantageous in many areas of geometry. However, the direct image of a sheaf of sections of a bundle is not in general the sheaf of sections of some direct image bundle, so that although the notion of a 'pushforward of a bundle' is defined in some contexts (for example, the pushforward by a diffeomorphism), in general it is better understood in the category of sheaves, because the objects it creates cannot in general be bundles.
