   Surgery obstruction      Surgery obstruction   In mathematics , specifically in surgery theory , the surgery obstructions define a map    θ  :    𝒩   (  X  )    →    L  n    (    π  1    (  X  )    )        normal-:  θ   normal-→    𝒩  X      subscript  L  n      subscript  π  1   X       \theta\colon\mathcal{N}(X)\to L_{n}(\pi_{1}(X))   from the normal invariants to the L-groups which is in the first instance a set-theoretic map (that means not necessarily a homomorphism ) with the following property when    n  ≥  5      n  5    n\geq 5   :  A degree-one normal map     (  f  ,  b  )   :   M  →  X      normal-:   f  b    normal-→  M  X     (f,b)\colon M\to X   is normally cobordant to a homotopy equivalence if and only if the image     θ   (  f  ,  b  )    =  0        θ   f  b    0    \theta(f,b)=0   in     L  n    (   ℤ   [    π  1    (  X  )    ]    )        subscript  L  n     ℤ   delimited-[]     subscript  π  1   X       L_{n}(\mathbb{Z}[\pi_{1}(X)])   .  Sketch of the definition  The surgery obstruction of a degree-one normal map has a relatively complicated definition.  Consider a degree-one normal map     (  f  ,  b  )   :   M  →  X      normal-:   f  b    normal-→  M  X     (f,b)\colon M\to X   . The idea in deciding the question whether it is normally cobordant to a homotopy equivalence is to try to systematically improve    (  f  ,  b  )     f  b    (f,b)   so that the map   f   f   f   becomes   m   m   m   -connected (that means the homotopy groups      π  *    (  f  )    =  0         subscript  π    f   0    \pi_{*}(f)=0   for    *  ≤  m     fragments    m    *\leq m   ) for high   m   m   m   . It is a consequence of Poincaré duality that if we can achieve this for    m  >   ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋       m      n  2      m>\lfloor n/2\rfloor   then the map   f   f   f   already is a homotopy equivalence. The word systematically above refers to the fact that one tries to do surgeries on   M   M   M   to kill elements of     π  i    (  f  )        subscript  π  i   f    \pi_{i}(f)   . In fact it is more convenient to use homology of the universal covers to observe how connected the map   f   f   f   is. More precisely, one works with the surgery kernels       K  i    (   M  ~   )    :=   ker   {   f  *   :     H  i    (   M  ~   )    →    H  i    (   X  ~   )     }       assign     subscript  K  i    normal-~  M      ker   conditional-set   subscript  f     normal-→     subscript  H  i    normal-~  M       subscript  H  i    normal-~  X         K_{i}(\tilde{M}):=\mathrm{ker}\{f_{*}\colon H_{i}(\tilde{M})\rightarrow H_{i}(%
 \tilde{X})\}   which one views as    ℤ   [    π  1    (  X  )    ]       ℤ   delimited-[]     subscript  π  1   X      \mathbb{Z}[\pi_{1}(X)]   -modules. If all these vanish, then the map   f   f   f   is a homotopy equivalence. As a consequence of Poincaré duality on   M   M   M   and   X   X   X   there is a    ℤ   [    π  1    (  X  )    ]       ℤ   delimited-[]     subscript  π  1   X      \mathbb{Z}[\pi_{1}(X)]   -modules Poincaré duality      K   n  -  i     (   M  ~   )    ≅    K  i    (   M  ~   )           superscript  K    n  i     normal-~  M       subscript  K  i    normal-~  M      K^{n-i}(\tilde{M})\cong K_{i}(\tilde{M})   , so one only has to watch half of them, that means those for which    i  ≤   ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋       i      n  2      i\leq\lfloor n/2\rfloor   .  Any degree-one normal map can be made    ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋        n  2     \lfloor n/2\rfloor   -connected by the process called surgery below the middle dimension. This is the process of killing elements of     K  i    (   M  ~   )        subscript  K  i    normal-~  M     K_{i}(\tilde{M})   for    i  <   ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋       i      n  2      i<\lfloor n/2\rfloor   described here when we have     p  +  q   =  n        p  q   n    p+q=n   such that    i  =  p  <   ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋         i  p           n  2       i=p<\lfloor n/2\rfloor   . After this is done there are two cases.  1. If    n  =   2  k       n    2  k     n=2k   then the only nontrivial homology group is the kernel      K  k    (   M  ~   )    :=   ker   {   f  *   :     H  k    (   M  ~   )    →    H  k    (   X  ~   )     }       assign     subscript  K  k    normal-~  M      ker   conditional-set   subscript  f     normal-→     subscript  H  k    normal-~  M       subscript  H  k    normal-~  X         K_{k}(\tilde{M}):=\mathrm{ker}\{f_{*}\colon H_{k}(\tilde{M})\rightarrow H_{k}(%
 \tilde{X})\}   . It turns out that the cup-product pairings on   M   M   M   and   X   X   X   induce a cup-product pairing on     K  k    (   M  ~   )        subscript  K  k    normal-~  M     K_{k}(\tilde{M})   . This defines a symmetric bilinear form in case    k  =   2  l       k    2  l     k=2l   and a skew-symmetric bilinear form in case    k  =    2  l   +  1       k      2  l   1     k=2l+1   . It turns out that these forms can be refined to   ε   ε   \varepsilon   -quadratic forms, where    ε  =    (   -  1   )   k       ε   superscript    1   k     \varepsilon=(-1)^{k}   . These   ε   ε   \varepsilon   -quadratic forms define elements in the L-groups     L  n    (    π  1    (  X  )    )        subscript  L  n      subscript  π  1   X     L_{n}(\pi_{1}(X))   .  2. If    n  =    2  k   +  1       n      2  k   1     n=2k+1   the definition is more complicated. Instead of a quadratic form one obtains from the geometry a quadratic formation, which is a kind of automorphism of quadratic forms. Such a thing defines an element in the odd-dimensional L-group     L  n    (    π  1    (  X  )    )        subscript  L  n      subscript  π  1   X     L_{n}(\pi_{1}(X))   .  If the element    θ   (  f  ,  b  )       θ   f  b     \theta(f,b)   is zero in the L-group surgery can be done on   M   M   M   to modify   f   f   f   to a homotopy equivalence.  Geometrically the reason why this is not always possible is that performing surgery in the middle dimension to kill an element in     K  k    (   M  ~   )        subscript  K  k    normal-~  M     K_{k}(\tilde{M})   possibly creates an element in     K   k  -  1     (   M  ~   )        subscript  K    k  1     normal-~  M     K_{k-1}(\tilde{M})   when    n  =   2  k       n    2  k     n=2k   or in     K  k    (   M  ~   )        subscript  K  k    normal-~  M     K_{k}(\tilde{M})   when    n  =    2  k   +  1       n      2  k   1     n=2k+1   . So this possibly destroys what has already been achieved. However, if    θ   (  f  ,  b  )       θ   f  b     \theta(f,b)   is zero, surgeries can be arranged in such a way that this does not happen.  Example  In the simply connected case the following happens.  If    n  =    2  k   +  1       n      2  k   1     n=2k+1   there is no obstruction.  If    n  =   4  l       n    4  l     n=4l   then the surgery obstruction can be calculated as the difference of the signatures of M and X.  If    n  =    4  l   +  2       n      4  l   2     n=4l+2   then the surgery obstruction is the Arf-invariant of the associated kernel quadratic form over    ℤ  2     subscript  ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}_{2}   .
