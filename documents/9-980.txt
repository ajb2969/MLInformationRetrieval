Isothermal coordinates

In mathematics, specifically in differential geometry, isothermal coordinates on a Riemannian manifold are local coordinates where the metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric. This means that in isothermal coordinates, the Riemannian metric locally has the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a smooth function.
Isothermal coordinates on surfaces were first introduced by Gauss. Korn and Lichtenstein proved that isothermal coordinates exist around any point on a two dimensional Riemannian manifold. On higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds a necessary and sufficient condition for their local existence is the vanishing of the Weyl tensor and of the Cotton tensor.
Isothermal coordinates on surfaces
proved the existence of isothermal coordinates on an arbitrary surface with a real analytic metric, following results of  on surfaces of revolution. Results for Hölder continuous metrics were obtained by  and . Later accounts were given by , ,  and . A particularly simple account using the Hodge star operator is given in .
Beltrami equation
The existence of isothermal coordinates can be proved1 by applying known existence theorems for the Beltrami equation, which rely on Lp estimates for singular integral operators of Calderon and Zygmund.23 A simpler approach to the Beltrami equation has been given more recently by the late Adrien Douady.4
If the Riemannian metric is given locally as



then in the complex coordinate z = x + iy, it takes the form



where λ and μ are smooth with λ > 0 and |μ|  \lambda={1\over 4} ( E + G +2\sqrt{EG -F^2}),\,\,\, \mu=(E - G + 2iF)/4\lambda.
In isothermal coordinates (u, v) the metric should take the form



with ρ > 0 smooth. The complex coordinate w = u + i v satisfies



so that the coordinates (u, v) will be isothermal if the Beltrami equation



has a diffeomorphic solution. Such a solution has been proved to exist in any neighbourhood where ||μ||∞  \star du =dv,
where 
 
 
 
  is the Hodge star operator defined by the metric.5
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Laplace–Beltrami operator on functions.
Then by standard elliptic theory, u can be chosen to be harmonic near a given point, i.e. Δ u = 0, with du non-vanishing.
By the Poincaré lemma

 
  has a local solution v exactly when 
 
 
 
 .
Since



this is equivalent to Δ u = 0, and hence a local solution exists.
Since du is non-zero and the square of the Hodge star operator is −1 on 1-forms, du and dv are necessarily linearly independent, and therefore give local isothermal coordinates.
Gaussian curvature
In the isothermal coordinates (u, v), the Gaussian curvature takes the simpler form



where
