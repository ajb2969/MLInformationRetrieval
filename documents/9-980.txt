   Isothermal coordinates      Isothermal coordinates   In mathematics , specifically in differential geometry , isothermal coordinates on a Riemannian manifold are local coordinates where the metric is conformal to the Euclidean metric . This means that in isothermal coordinates, the Riemannian metric locally has the form       g  =    e  φ    (    d   x  1  2    +  ⋯  +   d   x  n  2     )     ,      g     superscript  e  φ       d   superscript   subscript  x  1   2    normal-⋯    d   superscript   subscript  x  n   2        g=e^{\varphi}(dx_{1}^{2}+\cdots+dx_{n}^{2}),   where   φ   φ   \varphi   is a smooth function .  Isothermal coordinates on surfaces were first introduced by Gauss . Korn and Lichtenstein proved that isothermal coordinates exist around any point on a two dimensional Riemannian manifold. On higher-dimensional Riemannian manifolds a necessary and sufficient condition for their local existence is the vanishing of the Weyl tensor and of the Cotton tensor .  Isothermal coordinates on surfaces  proved the existence of isothermal coordinates on an arbitrary surface with a real analytic metric, following results of  on surfaces of revolution. Results for Hölder continuous metrics were obtained by  and . Later accounts were given by , ,  and . A particularly simple account using the Hodge star operator is given in .  Beltrami equation  The existence of isothermal coordinates can be proved 1 by applying known existence theorems for the Beltrami equation , which rely on L p estimates for singular integral operators of Calderon and Zygmund . 2 3 A simpler approach to the Beltrami equation has been given more recently by the late Adrien Douady . 4  If the Riemannian metric is given locally as        d   s  2    =     E   d   x  2    +   2   F   d   x   d  y   +    G   d   y  2      ,        d   superscript  s  2        E  d   superscript  x  2      2  F  d  x  d  y     G  d   superscript  y  2       ds^{2}=E\,dx^{2}+2F\,dx\,dy+G\,dy^{2},     then in the complex coordinate z = x + i y , it takes the form        d   s  2    =   λ    |    d  z   +    μ   d   z  ¯     |   2     ,        d   superscript  s  2      λ   superscript        d  z     μ  d   normal-¯  z      2      ds^{2}=\lambda|\,dz+\mu\,d\overline{z}|^{2},     where λ and μ are smooth with λ > 0 and |μ|  \lambda={1\over 4} ( E + G +2\sqrt{EG -F^2}),\,\,\, \mu=(E - G + 2iF)/4\lambda.  In isothermal coordinates ( u , v ) the metric should take the form       d   s  2    =   ρ   (    d   u  2    +   d   v  2     )          d   superscript  s  2      ρ      d   superscript  u  2      d   superscript  v  2        ds^{2}=\rho(du^{2}+dv^{2})     with ρ > 0 smooth. The complex coordinate w = u + i v satisfies         ρ     |   d  w   |   2    =   ρ    |   w  z   |   2     |    d  z   +      w   z  ¯     w  z     d   z  ¯     |   2     ,        ρ   superscript      d  w    2      ρ   superscript     subscript  w  z    2    superscript        d  z        subscript  w   normal-¯  z     subscript  w  z    d   normal-¯  z      2      \rho\,|dw|^{2}=\rho|w_{z}|^{2}|\,dz+{w_{\overline{z}}\over w_{z}}\,d\overline{%
 z}|^{2},     so that the coordinates ( u , v ) will be isothermal if the Beltrami equation        ∂  w    ∂   z  ¯     =   μ    ∂  w    ∂  z             w      normal-¯  z       μ      w     z       {\partial w\over\partial\overline{z}}=\mu{\partial w\over\partial z}     has a diffeomorphic solution. Such a solution has been proved to exist in any neighbourhood where ||μ|| ∞ \star du =dv,  where   ⋆   normal-⋆   \star   is the Hodge star operator defined by the metric. 5  Let    Δ  =    d  *   d       normal-Δ     superscript  d    d     \Delta=d^{*}d   be the Laplace–Beltrami operator on functions.  Then by standard elliptic theory, u can be chosen to be harmonic near a given point, i.e. Δ u = 0, with du non-vanishing.  By the Poincaré lemma     ⋆  d  u  =  d  v     fragments  normal-⋆  d  u   d  v    \star du=dv   has a local solution v exactly when      d  ⋆  d   u   =  0         normal-⋆  d  d   u   0    d\star du=0   .  Since      ⋆  d  ⋆  =   d  *   ,     fragments  normal-⋆  d  normal-⋆    superscript  d    normal-,    \star d\star=d^{*},     this is equivalent to Δ u = 0, and hence a local solution exists.  Since du is non-zero and the square of the Hodge star operator is −1 on 1-forms, du and dv are necessarily linearly independent, and therefore give local isothermal coordinates.  Gaussian curvature  In the isothermal coordinates ( u , v ), the Gaussian curvature takes the simpler form       K  =   -    1  2    e   -  φ     (      ∂  2   φ    ∂   u  2     +     ∂  2   φ    ∂   v  2      )      ,      K        1  2    superscript  e    φ          superscript   2   φ      superscript  u  2         superscript   2   φ      superscript  v  2          K=-\frac{1}{2}e^{-\varphi}\left(\frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial u^{2}}+%
 \frac{\partial^{2}\varphi}{\partial v^{2}}\right),     where    ρ  =   e  φ       ρ   superscript  e  φ     \rho=e^{\varphi}   .
