   Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase      Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase   Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (, THCA synthase , Delta1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase ) is an enzyme with system name cannabigerolate:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolate-forming) . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   cannabigerolate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolate + H 2 O 2    Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase is a flavoprotein (FAD).
