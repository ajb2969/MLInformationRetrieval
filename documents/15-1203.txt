Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase

Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase (, THCA synthase, Delta1-tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase) is an enzyme with system name cannabigerolate:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing, Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolate-forming).1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

cannabigerolate + O2

 
  Delta9-tetrahydrocannabinolate + H2O2


Tetrahydrocannabinolic acid synthase is a flavoprotein (FAD).
