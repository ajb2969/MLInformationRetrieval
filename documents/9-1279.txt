   Hypertranscendental number      Hypertranscendental number   A complex number is said to be hypertranscendental if it is not the value at an algebraic point of a function which is the solution of an algebraic differential equation with coefficients in Z [ r ] and with algebraic initial conditions .  The term was introduced by D. D. Morduhai-Boltovskoi in "Hypertranscendental numbers and hypertranscendental functions" (1949).  The term is related to transcendental numbers , which are numbers which are not a solution of a non-zero polynomial equation with rational coefficients. The number e is transcendental but not hypertranscendental, as it can be generated from the solution to the differential equation     y  ′   =  y       superscript  y  normal-′   y    y^{\prime}=y   .  Any hypertranscendental number is also a transcendental number.
