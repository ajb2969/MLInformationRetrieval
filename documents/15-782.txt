Quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase

Quinate/shikimate dehydrogenase (, YdiB) is an enzyme with system name L-quinate:NAD(P)+ 3-oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) L-quinate + NAD(P)+

 
  3-dehydroquinate + NAD(P)H + H+

(2) shikimate + NAD(P)+

 
  3-dehydroshikimate + NAD(P)H + H+


This is the second shikimate dehydrogenase enzyme found in Escherichia coli and differs from EC 1.1.1.25, shikimate dehydrogenase, in that it can use both quinate and shikimate as substrate, and either NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor.
