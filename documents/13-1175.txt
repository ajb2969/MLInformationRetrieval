   Fast-growing hierarchy      Fast-growing hierarchy   In computability theory , computational complexity theory and proof theory , a fast-growing hierarchy (also called an extended Grzegorczyk hierarchy ) is an ordinal-indexed family of rapidly increasing functions f α : N → N (where N is the set of natural numbers {0, 1, ...}, and α ranges up to some large countable ordinal). A primary example is the Wainer hierarchy , or Löb–Wainer hierarchy , which is an extension to all α 0. Such hierarchies provide a natural way to classify computable functions according to rate-of-growth and computational complexity .  Definition  Let μ be a large countable ordinal such that a fundamental sequence (a strictly increasing sequence of ordinals whose supremum is a limit ordinal ) is assigned to every limit ordinal less than μ. A fast-growing hierarchy of functions f α : N → N , for α  f_0(n) = n + 1,\,          f   α  +  1     (  n  )    =    f  α  n    (  n  )     ,         subscript  f    α  1    n      superscript   subscript  f  α   n   n     f_{\alpha+1}(n)=f_{\alpha}^{n}(n),\,           f  α    (  n  )    =    f   α   [  n  ]      (  n  )           subscript  f  α   n      subscript  f    α   delimited-[]  n     n     f_{\alpha}(n)=f_{\alpha[n]}(n)\,\!   if α is a limit ordinal.   Here f α n ( n ) = f α ( f α (...( f α ( n ))...)) denotes the n th iterate of f α applied to n , and α[ n ] denotes the n th element of the fundamental sequence assigned to the limit ordinal α. (An alternative definition takes the number of iterations to be n +1, rather than n , in the second line above.)  The initial part of this hierarchy, comprising the functions f α with finite index (i.e., α n , whereas the latter is an indexed family of sets of functions    ℰ  n     superscript  ℰ  n    \mathcal{E}^{n}   . (See Points of Interest below.)  Generalizing the above definition even further, a fast iteration hierarchy is obtained by taking f 0 to be any increasing function g: N → N .  For limit ordinals not greater than ε 0 , there is a straightforward natural definition of the fundamental sequences (see the Wainer hierarchy below), but beyond ε 0 the definition is much more complicated. However, this is possible well beyond the Feferman–Schütte ordinal, Γ 0 , up to at least the Bachmann–Howard ordinal . Using Buchholz psi functions one can extend this definition easily to the ordinal of transfinitely iterated    Π  1  1     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  1   1    \Pi^{1}_{1}   -comprehension (see Analytical hierarchy ).  A fully specified extension beyond the recursive ordinals is thought to be unlikely; e.g., Prӧmel et al. [1991](p. 348) note that in such an attempt "there would even arise problems in ordinal notation".  The Wainer hierarchy  The Wainer hierarchy is the particular fast-growing hierarchy of functions f α (α ≤ ε 0 ) obtained by defining the fundamental sequences as follows [Gallier 1991][Prӧmel, et al., 1991]:  For limit ordinals λ 0]], written in Cantor normal form ,   if λ = ω α 1 + ... + ω α k−1 + ω α k for α 1 ≥ ... ≥ α k−1 ≥ α k , then λ[ n ] = ω α 1 + ... + ω α k−1 + ω α k [ n ],    if λ = ω α+1 , then λ[ n ] = ω α n ,    if λ = ω α for a limit ordinal α, then λ[ n ] = ω α[ n ] ,   and   if λ = ε 0 , take λ[0] = 0 and λ[ n + 1] = ω λ[ n ] as in [Gallier 1991]; alternatively, take the same sequence except starting with λ[0] = 1 as in [Prӧmel, et al., 1991]. For n > 0, the alternative version has one additional ω in the resulting exponential tower, i.e. λ[ n ] = ω ω . . . ω with n omegas.   Some authors use slightly different definitions (e.g., ω α+1 [ n ] = ω α ( n+1 ), instead of ω α n ), and some define this hierarchy only for α 0 (thus excluding f ε 0 from the hierarchy).  To continue beyond ε 0 , see the Fundamental sequences for the Veblen hierarchy .  Points of interest  Following are some relevant points of interest about fast-growing hierarchies:   Every f α is a total function . If the fundamental sequences are computable (e.g., as in the Wainer hierarchy), then every f α is a total computable function .    In the Wainer hierarchy, f α is dominated by f β if α g ( n ) for all sufficiently large n .) The same property holds in any fast-growing hierarchy with fundamental sequences satisfying the so-called Bachmann property . (This property holds for most natural well orderings.)    In the Grzegorczyk hierarchy, every primitive recursive function is dominated by some f α with α ω, which is a variant of the Ackermann function .    For n ≥ 3, the set    ℰ  n     superscript  ℰ  n    \mathcal{E}^{n}   in the Grzegorczyk hierarchy is composed of just those total multi-argument functions which, for sufficiently large arguments, are computable within time bounded by some fixed iterate f n -1 k evaluated at the maximum argument.    In the Wainer hierarchy, every f α with α 0]] is computable and provably total in Peano Arithmetic .    Every computable function that's provably total in Peano Arithmetic is dominated by some f α with α 0]] in the Wainer hierarchy. Hence f ε 0 in the Wainer hierarchy is not provably total in Peano Arithmetic.    The Goodstein function has approximately the same growth rate ( i.e. each is dominated by some fixed iterate of the other) as f ε 0 in the Wainer hierarchy, dominating every f α for which α 0]], and hence is not provably total in Peano Arithmetic.    In the Wainer hierarchy, if α 0]], then f β dominates every computable function within time and space bounded by some fixed iterate f α k .    Friedman's TREE function dominates f Γ 0 in a fast-growing hierarchy described by Gallier (1991).    The Wainer hierarchy of functions f α and the Hardy hierarchy of functions h α are related by f α = h ω α for all α 0. The Hardy hierarchy "catches up" to the Wainer hierarchy at α = ε 0 , such that f ε 0 and h ε 0 have the same growth rate, in the sense that f ε 0 ( n -1) ≤ h ε 0 ( n ) ≤ f ε 0 ( n +1) for all n ≥ 1. (Gallier 1991)     and Cichon & Wainer (1983) showed that the slow-growing hierarchy of functions g α attains the same growth rate as the function f ε 0 in the Wainer hierarchy when α is the Bachmann-Howard ordinal . Girard (1981) further showed that the slow-growing hierarchy g α attains the same growth rate as f α (in a particular fast-growing hierarchy) when α is the ordinal of the theory ID <ω of arbitrary finite iterations of an inductive definition. (Wainer 1989)   Functions in fast-growing hierarchies  The functions at finite levels (α 0( n ) = n + 1   f 1 ( n ) = f 0 n ( n ) = n + n = 2 n  f 2 ( n ) = f 1 n ( n ) = 2 n n > (2 ↑) n  for n ≥ 2 (using Knuth up-arrow notation )  f k +1 ( n ) = f k n ( n ) > (2 ↑ k -1 ) n  n ≥ 2 ↑ k  n for n ≥ 2, k < ω.   Beyond the finite levels are the functions of the Wainer hierarchy (ω ≤ α ≤ ε 0 ):   f ω ( n ) = f n ( n ) > 2 ↑ n - 1  n > 2 ↑ n − 2 ( n + 3) − 3 = A ( n , n ) for n ≥ 4, where A is the Ackermann function (of which f ω is a unary version).  f ω+1 ( n ) = f ω n ( n ) ≥ f n ↑ n n ( n ) for all n > 0, where n ↑ n n is the n th  Ackermann number .    f ω+1 (64) > f ω 64 (6) > Graham's number (= g 64 in the sequence defined by g 0 = 4, g k +1 = 3 ↑ g k 3). This follows by noting f ω ( n ) > 2 ↑ n - 1  n > 3 ↑ n - 2 3 + 2, and hence f ω ( g k + 2) > g k +1 + 2.    f ε 0 ( n ) is the first function in the Wainer hierarchy that dominates the Goodstein function .
