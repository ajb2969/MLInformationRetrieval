   G-factor (physics)      G-factor (physics)   A g -factor (also called g value or dimensionless magnetic moment ) is a dimensionless quantity that characterizes the magnetic moment and gyromagnetic ratio of a particle or nucleus . It is essentially a proportionality constant that relates the observed magnetic moment μ of a particle to its angular momentum  quantum number and a unit of magnetic moment, usually the Bohr magneton or nuclear magneton .  Definition  Dirac particle  The spin magnetic moment of a charged, spin-1/2 particle that does not possess any internal structure (a Dirac particle) is given by 1       𝝁  =   g   e   2  m    𝑺    ,      𝝁    g    e    2  m    𝑺     \boldsymbol{\mu}=g{e\over 2m}\boldsymbol{S},     where μ is the spin magnetic moment of the particle, g is the g -factor of the particle, e is the elementary charge , m is the mass of the particle, and S is the spin angular momentum of the particle (with magnitude ħ /2 for Dirac particles).  Baryon or nucleus  Protons, neutrons, nuclei and other composite baryonic particles have magnetic moments arising from their spin (both of which may be zero). Conventionally, the associated g -factors are defined using the nuclear magneton , and thus implicitly using the proton's mass rather than the particle's mass as for a Dirac particle. The formula used under this convention is       𝝁  =   g    μ  N   ℏ   𝑰   =   g   e   2   m  p     𝑰    ,        𝝁    g     subscript  μ  N   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   𝑰          g    e    2   subscript  m  p     𝑰      \boldsymbol{\mu}=g{\mu_{\text{N}}\over\hbar}\boldsymbol{I}=g{e\over 2m_{\text{%
 p}}}\boldsymbol{I},     where μ is the magnetic moment of the nucleon or nucleus resulting from its spin, g is the effective g -factor, I is its spin angular momentum, μ N is the nuclear magneton , e is the elementary charge and m p is the proton rest mass.  Calculation  Electron g -factors  There are three magnetic moments associated with an electron: one from its spin angular momentum , one from its orbital angular momentum , and one from its total angular momentum (the quantum-mechanical sum of those two components). Corresponding to these three moments are three different g -factors:  Electron spin g -factor  The most famous of these is the electron spin g-factor (more often called simply the electron g-factor ), g e , defined by       𝝁  s   =    g  e     μ  B   ℏ   𝑺        subscript  𝝁  s      subscript  g  e      subscript  μ  B   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   𝑺     \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{s}}=g_{\text{e}}{\mu_{\text{B}}\over\hbar}\boldsymbol{S}     where μ s is the magnetic moment resulting from the spin of an electron, S is its spin angular momentum, and μ B is the Bohr magneton . In atomic physics, the electron spin g -factor is often defined as the absolute value or negative of g e :        g  s   =   |   g  e   |   =   -   g  e     .         subscript  g  s      subscript  g  e            subscript  g  e       g_{\text{s}}=|g_{\text{e}}|=-g_{\text{e}}.     The z -component of the magnetic moment then becomes       μ  z   =   -    g  s    μ  B    m  s          subscript  μ  z        subscript  g  s    subscript  μ  B    subscript  m  s       \mu_{\text{z}}=-g_{\text{s}}\mu_{\text{B}}m_{\text{s}}     The value g s is roughly equal to 2.002319, and is known to extraordinary precision. 2 3 The reason it is not precisely two is explained by quantum electrodynamics calculation of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment . 4  Electron orbital g -factor  Secondly, the electron orbital g-factor , g L , is defined by        𝝁  L   =   -    g  L     μ  B   ℏ   𝑳     ,       subscript  𝝁  L        subscript  g  L      subscript  μ  normal-B   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   𝑳      \boldsymbol{\mu}_{\text{L}}=-g_{\text{L}}{\mu_{\mathrm{B}}\over\hbar}%
 \boldsymbol{L},     where μ L is the magnetic moment resulting from the orbital angular momentum of an electron, L is its orbital angular momentum, and μ B is the Bohr magneton . The value of g L is exactly equal to one, by a quantum-mechanical argument analogous to the derivation of the classical magnetogyric ratio . For an electron in an orbital with a magnetic quantum number m l , the z -component of the orbital angular momentum is       μ  z   =    g  L    μ  B    m  l         subscript  μ  z      subscript  g  L    subscript  μ  B    subscript  m  l      \mu_{\text{z}}=g_{\text{L}}\mu_{\text{B}}m_{\text{l}}     which, since g L = 1, is μ B m l  Total angular momentum (Landé) g -factor  Thirdly, the Landé g-factor , g J , is defined by      𝝁  =   -    g  J     μ  B   ℏ   𝑱        𝝁       subscript  g  J      subscript  μ  B   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   𝑱      \boldsymbol{\mu}=-g_{\text{J}}{\mu_{\text{B}}\over\hbar}\boldsymbol{J}     where μ is the total magnetic moment resulting from both spin and orbital angular momentum of an electron,  is its total angular momentum, and μ B is the Bohr magneton . The value of g J is related to g L and g s by a quantum-mechanical argument; see the article Landé g-factor .  Muon g -factor  The muon, like the electron, has a g -factor associated with its spin, given by the equation       𝝁  =   g   e   2   m  μ     𝑺    ,      𝝁    g    e    2   subscript  m  μ     𝑺     \boldsymbol{\mu}=g{e\over 2m_{\mu}}\boldsymbol{S},     where μ is the magnetic moment resulting from the muon’s spin, S is the spin angular momentum, and m μ is the muon mass.  That the muon g -factor is not quite the same as the electron g -factor is mostly explained by quantum electrodynamics and its calculation of the anomalous magnetic dipole moment . Almost all of the small difference between the two values (99.96% of it) is due to a well-understood lack of a heavy-particle diagrams contributing to the probability for emission of a photon representing the magnetic dipole field, which are present for muons, but not electrons, in QED theory. These are entirely a result of the mass difference between the particles.  However, not all of the difference between the g-factors for electrons and muons is exactly explained by the Standard Model . The muon g -factor can, in theory, be affected by physics beyond the Standard Model , so it has been measured very precisely, in particular at the Brookhaven National Laboratory . In the E821 collaboration final report in November 2006, the experimental measured value is , compared to the theoretical prediction of . 5 This is a difference of 3.4 standard deviations , suggesting that beyond-the-Standard-Model physics may be having an effect. The Brookhaven muon storage ring has been transported to Fermilab where the g−2 experiment will use it to make more precise measurements of muon g-factor. 6  Measured g -factor values      Particle   Symbol   g -factor   Uncertainty       electron   g e       muon   g μ       neutron   g n       proton   g p         Currently accepted NIST  g -factor values 7     The electron g -factor is one of the most precisely measured values in physics, with a relative standard uncertainty of .
