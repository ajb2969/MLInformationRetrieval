Scheffé’s lemma

In mathematics, Scheffé's lemma is a proposition in measure theory concerning the convergence of sequences of integrals. It states that, if $f_n$ is a sequence of integrable functions on a measure space $(X,\Sigma,\mu)$ that converges almost everywhere to another integrable function $f$, then $\int |f_n - f| \, d\mu \to 0$ if and only if $\int | f_n | \, d\mu \to \int | f | \, d\mu$.1
Applications
Applied to probability theory, Scheffe's theorem, in the form stated here, implies that almost everywhere pointwise convergence of the probability density functions of a sequence of $\mu$absolutely continuous random variables implies convergence in distribution of those random variables.2
History
Henry Scheffé published a proof of the statement on convergence of probability densities in 1947. The result however is a special case of a theorem by Frigyes Riesz about convergence in Lp spaces published in 1928.3
