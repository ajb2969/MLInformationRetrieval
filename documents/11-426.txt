   Acetylalkylglycerol acetylhydrolase      Acetylalkylglycerol acetylhydrolase   In enzymology , an acetylalkylglycerol acetylhydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-acetyl-1-alkyl-sn-glycerol + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-alkyl-sn-glycerol + acetate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-acetyl-1-alkyl-sn-glycerol and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 1-alkyl-sn-glycerol and acetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-acetyl-1-alkyl-sn-glycerol acetylhydrolase . This enzyme is also called alkylacetylglycerol acetylhydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
