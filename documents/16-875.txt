Hirota-Satsuma equation

Hirota Satsuma equation is a set of three coupled nonlinear partial differential equations：1









Hirota-Satsuma equation appeared in the theory of shallow water waves, first discussed by Hirota, Ryogo; Satsuma, Junkichi in 1976.2
Hirota-Satsuma equation has multiple soliton solutions and traveling wave solutions.
