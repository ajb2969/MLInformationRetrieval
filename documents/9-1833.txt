   McShane's identity      McShane's identity   In geometric topology , McShane's identity for a once punctured torus    𝕋   𝕋   \mathbb{T}   with a complete, finite-volume hyperbolic structure is given by        ∑  γ    1   1  +   e   ℓ   (  γ  )        =   1  2         subscript   γ     1    1   superscript  e    normal-ℓ  γ         1  2     \sum_{\gamma}\frac{1}{1+e^{\ell(\gamma)}}=\frac{1}{2}     where   the sum is over all simple closed geodesics γ on the torus; and  ℓ ( γ ) denotes the hyperbolic length of γ .
