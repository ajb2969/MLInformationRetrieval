   Salutaridine synthase      Salutaridine synthase   In enzymology , a salutaridine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-reticuline + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   salutaridine + NADP + + 2 H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are (R)-reticuline , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are salutaridine , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-reticuline,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (C-C phenol-coupling) . This enzyme is also called (R)-reticuline oxidase (C-C phenol-coupling) . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.21  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
