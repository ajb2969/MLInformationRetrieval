Salutaridine synthase




Salutaridine synthase

In enzymology, a salutaridine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-reticuline + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  salutaridine + NADP+ + 2 H2O
 

The 4 substrates of this enzyme are (R)-reticuline, NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas its 3 products are salutaridine, NADP+, and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-reticuline,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (C-C phenol-coupling). This enzyme is also called (R)-reticuline oxidase (C-C phenol-coupling). This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i.
