   Moreau's theorem      Moreau's theorem   In mathematics , Moreau's theorem is a result in convex analysis . It shows that sufficiently well-behaved  convex functionals on Hilbert spaces are differentiable and the derivative is well-approximated by the so-called Yosida approximation , which is defined in terms of the resolvent operator .  Statement of the theorem  Let H be a Hilbert space and let φ : H → R ∪ {+∞} be a proper , convex and lower semi-continuous  extended real-valued functional on H . Let A stand for ∂ φ , the subderivative of φ ; for α > 0 let J α denote the resolvent:        J  α   =    (   id  +   α  A    )    -  1     ;       subscript  J  α    superscript    id    α  A      1      J_{\alpha}=(\mathrm{id}+\alpha A)^{-1};     and let A α denote the Yosida approximation to A :        A  α   =    1  α    (   id  -   J  α    )     .       subscript  A  α       1  α     id   subscript  J  α       A_{\alpha}=\frac{1}{\alpha}(\mathrm{id}-J_{\alpha}).     For each α > 0 and x ∈ H , let         φ  α    (  x  )    =     inf   y  ∈  H      1   2  α      ∥   y  -  x   ∥   2     +   φ   (  y  )      .         subscript  φ  α   x       subscript  infimum    y  H        1    2  α     superscript   norm    y  x    2       φ  y      \varphi_{\alpha}(x)=\inf_{y\in H}\frac{1}{2\alpha}\|y-x\|^{2}+\varphi(y).     Then        φ  α    (  x  )    =     α  2     ∥    A  α   x   ∥   2    +   φ   (    J  α    (  x  )    )            subscript  φ  α   x         α  2    superscript   norm     subscript  A  α   x    2      φ     subscript  J  α   x       \varphi_{\alpha}(x)=\frac{\alpha}{2}\|A_{\alpha}x\|^{2}+\varphi(J_{\alpha}(x))     and φ α is convex and Fréchet differentiable with derivative d φ α = A α . Also, for each x ∈ H (pointwise), φ α ( x ) converges upwards to φ ( x ) as α → 0.  References    (Proposition IV.1.8)   "  Category:Convex analysis  Category:Theorems in functional analysis
