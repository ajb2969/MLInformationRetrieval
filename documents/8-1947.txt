Schur test

In mathematical analysis, the Schur test, named after German mathematician Issai Schur, is a bound on the 
 
 
operator norm of an integral operator in terms of its Schwartz kernel (see Schwartz kernel theorem).
Here is one version.1 Let 
 
 
 
  be two measurable spaces (such as 
 
 
 
 ). Let 
 
 
 
  be an integral operator with the non-negative Schwartz kernel 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 :



If there exist functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and numbers 
 
 
 
  such that



for almost all

 
  and



for almost all 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  extends to a continuous operator

 
  with the operator norm



Such functions 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are called the Schur test functions.
In the original version, 
 
 
 
  is a matrix and 
 
 
 
 .2
Common usage and Young's inequality
A common usage of the Schur test is to take 
 
 
 
  Then we get:



This inequality is valid no matter whether the Schwartz kernel 
 
 
 
  is non-negative or not.
A similar statement about 
 
 
 
  operator norms is known as Young's inequality:3
if



where 
 
 
 
  satisfies 
 
 
 
 , for some 
 
 
 
 , then the operator 
 
 
 
  extends to a continuous operator 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 

Proof
Using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality and the inequality (1), we get:



Integrating the above relation in 
 
 
 
 , using Fubini's Theorem, and applying the inequality (2), we get:



It follows that 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 .
