Freiman's theorem

In mathematics, Freiman's theorem is a combinatorial result in additive number theory. In a sense it accounts for the approximate structure of sets of integers that contain a high proportion of their internal sums, taken two at a time.
The formal statement is:
Let A be a finite set of integers such that the sumset



is small, in the sense that



for some constant 
 
 
 
 . There exists an n-dimensional arithmetic progression of length



that contains A, and such that c' and n depend only on c.1
A simple instructive case is the following. We always have



with equality precisely when A is an arithmetic progression.
This result is due to Gregory Freiman (1964,1966).2 Much interest in it, and applications, stemmed from a new proof by Imre Z. Ruzsa (1994).
