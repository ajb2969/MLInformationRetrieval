   Freiman's theorem      Freiman's theorem   In mathematics , Freiman's theorem is a combinatorial result in additive number theory . In a sense it accounts for the approximate structure of sets of integers that contain a high proportion of their internal sums, taken two at a time.  The formal statement is:  Let A be a finite set of integers such that the sumset      A  +   A       A  A    A+A\,     is small, in the sense that       |   A  +  A   |   <   c   |  A  |            A  A      c    A      |A+A|     for some constant   c   c   c   . There exists an n -dimensional arithmetic progression of length       c  ′    |  A  |        superscript  c  normal-′     A     c^{\prime}|A|\,     that contains A , and such that c ' and n depend only on c . 1  A simple instructive case is the following. We always have       |   A  +  A   |   ≥    2   |  A  |    -  1           A  A        2    A    1     |A+A|\geq 2|A|-1     with equality precisely when A is an arithmetic progression.  This result is due to Gregory Freiman (1964,1966). 2 Much interest in it, and applications, stemmed from a new proof by Imre Z. Ruzsa (1994).
