   Geissoschizine dehydrogenase      Geissoschizine dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a geissoschizine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   geissoschizine + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4,21-didehydrogeissoschizine + NADPH   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are geissoschizine and NADP + , whereas its two products are 4,21-didehydrogeissoschizine and NADPH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geissoschizine:NADP+ 4,21-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis .
