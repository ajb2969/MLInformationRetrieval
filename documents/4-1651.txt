   Stanley's reciprocity theorem      Stanley's reciprocity theorem   In combinatorial  mathematics , Stanley's reciprocity theorem , named after MIT mathematician Richard P. Stanley , states that a certain functional equation is satisfied by the generating function of any rational cone (defined below) and the generating function of the cone's interior.  A rational cone is the set of all d - tuples   ( a 1 , ..., a d )   of nonnegative integers satisfying a system of inequalities       M   [      a  1       ⋮       a  d      ]    ≥   [     0      ⋮      0     ]         M   delimited-[]     subscript  a  1     normal-⋮     subscript  a  d        delimited-[]    0    normal-⋮    0       M\left[\begin{matrix}a_{1}\\
 \vdots\\
 a_{d}\end{matrix}\right]\geq\left[\begin{matrix}0\\
 \vdots\\
 0\end{matrix}\right]     where M is a matrix of integers. A d -tuple satisfying the corresponding strict inequalities, i.e., with ">" rather than "≥", is in the interior of the cone.  The generating function of such a cone is        F   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  d   )    =    ∑    (   a  1   ,  …  ,   a  d   )   ∈  cone      x  1   a  1    ⋯   x  d   a  d       .        F    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  d       subscript       subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  d    cone       superscript   subscript  x  1    subscript  a  1    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  d    subscript  a  d        F(x_{1},\dots,x_{d})=\sum_{(a_{1},\dots,a_{d})\in{\rm cone}}x_{1}^{a_{1}}%
 \cdots x_{d}^{a_{d}}.     The generating function F int ( x 1 , ..., x d ) of the interior of the cone is defined in the same way, but one sums over d -tuples in the interior rather than in the whole cone.  It can be shown that these are rational functions . Stanley's reciprocity theorem states that        F   (   1  /   x  1    ,  …  ,   1  /   x  d    )    =     (   -  1   )   d    F  int    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  d   )     .        F     1   subscript  x  1    normal-…    1   subscript  x  d         superscript    1   d    subscript  F  int     subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  d       F(1/x_{1},\dots,1/x_{d})=(-1)^{d}F_{\rm int}(x_{1},\dots,x_{d}).     Matthias Beck , Mike Develin , and Sinai Robins have shown how to prove this by using the calculus of residues . Develin has said that this amounts to proving the result "without doing any work".
