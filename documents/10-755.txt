   Carnosine N-methyltransferase      Carnosine N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a carnosine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + carnosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + anserine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and carnosine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and anserine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:carnosine N-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism .
