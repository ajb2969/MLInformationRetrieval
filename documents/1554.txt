   Rational point      Rational point   In number theory , a rational point is a point in space each of whose coordinates are rational; that is, the coordinates of the point are elements of the field of rational numbers , as well as being elements of larger fields that contain the rational numbers, such as the real numbers and the complex numbers .  For example,    (  3  ,    −  67   /  4   )     3      normal-−  67   4     (3,−67/4)   is a rational point in 2-dimensional space, since 3 and −67/4 are rational numbers. A special case of a rational point is an integer point , that is, a point all of whose coordinates are integers. E.g.,    (  1  ,   −  5   ,  0  )     1    normal-−  5   0    (1,−5,0)   is an integral point in 3-dimensional space. On the other hand, more generally, a K -rational point is a point in a space where each coordinate of the point belongs to the field K , as well as being elements of larger fields containing the field K . This is analogous to rational points, which, as stated above, are contained in fields larger than the rationals. A corresponding special case of K -rational points are those that belong to a ring of algebraic integers existing inside the field K .  Rational or K -rational points on algebraic varieties  Let V be an algebraic variety over a field K . When V is affine, given by a set of equations 0, j {{=}}1, ..., m }} , with coefficients in K , a K -rational point P of V is an ordered n-tuple  of numbers from the field K that is a solution of all of the equations simultaneously. In the general case, a K -rational point of V is a K -rational point of some affine open subset of V .  When V is projective, defined in some projective space    ℙ  n     superscript  ℙ  n    \mathbb{P}^{n}   by homogeneous polynomials     f  1   ,  …  ,   f  m       subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  m     f_{1},\dots,f_{m}   (with coefficients in K ), a K -rational point of V is a point    [    x  0   :  ⋯  :   x  n    ]     delimited-[]     normal-:   subscript  x  0   normal-⋯    normal-:     subscript  x  n       [x_{0}:\cdots:x_{n}]   in the projective space, all of whose coordinates are in K , which is a common solution of all the equations     f  j   =  0       subscript  f  j   0    f_{j}=0   .  Sometimes when no confusion is possible (or when K is the field of the rational numbers), we say rational points instead of K -rational points.  Rational (as well as K -rational) points that lie on an algebraic variety (such as an elliptic curve ) constitute a major area of current research. For an abelian variety  A , the K -rational points form a group . The Mordell-Weil theorem states that the group of rational points of an abelian variety over K is finitely generated if K is a number field .  The Weil conjectures concern the distribution of rational points on varieties over finite fields , where 'rational points' are taken to mean points from the smallest subfield of the finite field the variety has been defined over.  Example 1  The point    (  3  ,    −  67   /  4   )     3      normal-−  67   4     (3,−67/4)   is one of the infinite set of rational points on the straight line given by the equation     y  +   67  /  4    =   2   (   x  −  3   )          y    67  4      2    x  normal-−  3      y+67/4=2(x−3)   . This set of rational points forms a commutative group with group operation        (  a  ,  b  )   "   +   "   (  r  ,  s  )     =   (   a  +  r   ,   b  +  s  +   91  /  4    )            a  b   normal-"     normal-"   r  s        a  r     b  s    91  4       (a,b)"+"(r,s)=(a+r,b+s+91/4)   , and group identity     (  0  ,    −  91   /  4   )     0      normal-−  91   4     (0,−91/4)   . It can be shown that there are no integral points on this particular line. This line is a simple type of an algebraic curve, which in turn is a type of algebraic variety. It should be pointed out that there are also algebraic curves which contain just finitely many or even no rational points at all (e.g. the conic      x  2   +   y  2   +  1   =  0         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2   1   0    x^{2}+y^{2}+1=0   .).  Example 2  The point    P  =   (   √  2   ,  3  )       P     normal-√  2   3     P=(√2,3)   is a point on the algebraic variety (in this case a parabola ) given by the equation 0}}. Although P is not a rational point, since the coordinate √2 is not rational, P  is an F -rational point, if F is chosen to be the field of numbers of the form    a  +   b  √  2       a    b  normal-√  2     a+b√2   , where a and b are arbitrary rational numbers. This is because the coordinate     √  2   =   0  +   1  √  2          normal-√  2     0    1  normal-√  2      √2=0+1√2   , and the coordinate    3  =   3  +   0  √  2        3    3    0  normal-√  2      3=3+0√2   , and the numbers 0, 1, and 3 are rational.  Example 3  A point (a,b,c) in the complex projective plane is R -rational (or, as is common to say, real) if there exists a complex number z such that za , zb and zc are all real numbers . Otherwise it is a complex point. This description generalizes to complex projective space of higher dimension.  Rational points of schemes  In the parlance of morphisms of schemes, a K -rational point of a scheme X is just a morphism Spec    K  →  X      K  normal-→  X    K→X   . The set of K -rational points is usually denoted    X   (  K  )       X  K    X(K)   .  If a scheme or variety X is defined over a field  k , a point    x  ∈  X      x  normal-∈  X    x∈X   is also called a rational point if its residue field     k   (  x  )       k  x    k(x)   is isomorphic to k .
