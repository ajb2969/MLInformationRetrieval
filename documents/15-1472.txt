D-Man-alpha-(1-3)-D-Glc-beta-(1-4)-D-Glc-alpha-1-diphosphoundecaprenol 2-beta-glucuronyltransferase

D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Glc-beta-(1->4)-D-Glc-alpha-1-diphosphoundecaprenol 2-beta-glucuronyltransferase (, GumK) is an enzyme with system name UDP-glucuronate:D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Glc-beta-(1->4)-D-Glc-alpha-1-diphospho-ditrans,octacis-undecaprenol beta-1,2-glucuronyltransferase.1234567 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-glucuronate + D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Glc-beta-(1->4)-D-Glc-alpha-1-diphospho-ditrans,octacis-undecaprenol 
 
 
 
  UDP + D-GlcA-beta-(1->2)-D-Man-alpha-(1->3)-D-Glc-beta-(1->4)-D-Glc-alpha-1-diphospho-ditrans,octacis-undecaprenol
 

The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the exopolysaccharides xanthan (in the bacterium Xanthomonas campestris) and acetan (in the bacterium Gluconacetobacter xylinus).
