   Dagger symmetric monoidal category      Dagger symmetric monoidal category  A '''dagger symmetric monoidal category''' is a [[monoidal category]] \langle\mathbb{C},\otimes, I\rangle which also possesses a [[dagger category|dagger structure]]; in other words, it means that this category comes equipped not only with a [[tensor]] in t he category theoretic sense but also with dagger structure which is used to describe unitary morphism and self-adjoint morphisms in   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   that is, a form of abstract analogues of those found in FdHilb , the category of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces . This type of category was introduced by Selinger 1 as an intermediate structure between dagger categories and the dagger compact categories that are used in categorical quantum mechanics , an area which now also considers dagger symmetric monoidal categories when dealing with infinite-dimensional quantum mechanical concepts.  Formal definition  A dagger symmetric monoidal category is a symmetric monoidal category    ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   which also has a dagger structure such that for all    f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f:A\rightarrow B   ,    g  :   C  →  D      normal-:  g   normal-→  C  D     g:C\rightarrow D   and all    A  ,  B     A  B    A,B   and   C   C   C   in    O  b   (  ℂ  )       O  b  ℂ    Ob(\mathbb{C})   ,          (   f  ⊗  g   )   †   =    f  †   ⊗   g  †     :    B  ⊗  D   →   A  ⊗  C       normal-:     superscript   tensor-product  f  g   normal-†    tensor-product   superscript  f  normal-†    superscript  g  normal-†      normal-→   tensor-product  B  D    tensor-product  A  C      (f\otimes g)^{\dagger}=f^{\dagger}\otimes g^{\dagger}:B\otimes D\rightarrow A\otimes

Here,    α  ,  λ  ,  ρ     α  λ  ρ    \alpha,\lambda,\rho   and   σ   σ   \sigma   are the natural isomorphisms that form the symmetric monoidal structure .  Examples  The following categories are examples of dagger symmetric monoidal categories:   The category  Rel of sets and relations where the tensor is given by the product and where the dagger of a relation is given by its relational converse.  The category  FdHilb of finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces is a dagger symmetric monoidal category where the tensor is the usual tensor product of Hilbert spaces and where the dagger of a linear map is given by its hermitian adjoint .   A dagger-symmetric category which is also compact closed is a dagger compact category ; both of the above examples are in fact dagger compact.
