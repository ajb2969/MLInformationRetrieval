   Achilles number      Achilles number   An Achilles number is a number that is powerful but not a perfect power . 1 A positive integer n is a powerful number if, for every prime factor  p of n , p 2 is also a divisor. In other words, every prime factor appears at least squared in the factorization. All Achilles numbers are powerful. However, not all powerful numbers are Achilles numbers: only those that cannot be represented as m k , where m and k are positive integers greater than 1.  Achilles numbers are named after Achilles , a hero of the Trojan war , who was also powerful but imperfect.  Sequence of Achilles numbers  A number n = p 1 a 1 p 2 a 2 … p k a k is powerful if min( a 1 , a 2 , …, a k ) ≥ 2. If in addition gcd( a 1 , a 2 , …, a k ) = 1 the number is an Achilles number.  The Achilles numbers up to 5000 are:   72, 108, 200, 288, 392, 432, 500, 648, 675, 800, 864, 968, 972, 1125, 1152, 1323, 1352, 1372, 1568, 1800, 1944, 2000, 2312, 2592, 2700, 2888, 3087, 3200, 3267, 3456, 3528, 3872, 3888, 4000, 4232, 4500, 4563, 4608, 5000 .   The smallest pair of consecutive Achilles numbers is: 2   5425069447 = 7 3 × 41 2 × 97 2   5425069448 = 2 3 × 26041 2    Examples  108 is a powerful number. Its prime factorization is 2 2 · 3 3 , and thus its prime factors are 2 and 3. Both 2 2 = 4 and 3 2 = 9 are divisors of 108. However, 108 cannot be represented as m k , where m and k are positive integers greater than 1, so 108 is an Achilles number.  360 is not an Achilles number because it is not powerful. One of its prime factors is 5 but 360 is not divisible by 5 2 = 25.  Finally, 784 is not an Achilles number. It is a powerful number, because not only are 2 and 7 its only prime factors, but also 2 2 = 4 and 7 2 = 49 are divisors of it. Nonetheless, it is a perfect power:       784  =    2  4   ⋅   7  2    =     (   2  2   )   2   ⋅   7  2    =    (    2  2   ⋅  7   )   2   =   28  2    .        784   normal-⋅   superscript  2  4    superscript  7  2          normal-⋅   superscript   superscript  2  2   2    superscript  7  2          superscript   normal-⋅   superscript  2  2   7   2         superscript  28  2      784=2^{4}\cdot 7^{2}=(2^{2})^{2}\cdot 7^{2}=(2^{2}\cdot 7)^{2}=28^{2}.\,     So it is not an Achilles number.
