Transport coefficient




Transport coefficient

A Transport coefficient

 
  can be expressed via a Green-Kubo relation:


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an observable occurring in a perturbed Hamiltonian, 
 
 
 
  is an ensemble average and the dot above the A denotes the time derivative.1 For times 
 
 
 
  that are greater than the correlation time of the fluctuations of the observable the transport coefficient obeys a generalized Einstein relation:



Examples

Diffusion constant, relates the flux of particles with the negative gradient of the concentration (see Fick's laws of diffusion)
Heat transport coefficient
Mass transport coefficient
Shear Viscosity


Electrical conductivity
