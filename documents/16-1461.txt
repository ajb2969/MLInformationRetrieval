   Exponential map      Exponential map   In differential geometry , the exponential map is a generalization of the ordinary exponential function of mathematical analysis. Important special cases include:   exponential map (Riemannian geometry) for a manifold with a Riemannian metric,  exponential map (Lie theory) from a Lie algebra to a Lie group,  More generally, in a manifold with an affine connection ,    X  ↦    γ  X    (  1  )       maps-to  X     subscript  γ  X   1     X\mapsto\gamma_{X}(1)   , where    γ  X     subscript  γ  X    \gamma_{X}   is a geodesic with initial velocity X , is sometimes also called the exponential map. The above two are special cases of this with respect to appropriate affine connections.  Euler's formula forming the unit circle in the complex plane.   "
