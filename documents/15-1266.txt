Malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase

Malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (, BioC) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + malonyl-CoA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + malonyl-CoA methyl ester
 

Malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase is involved in an early step of biotin biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria.
