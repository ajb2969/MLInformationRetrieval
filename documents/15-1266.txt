   Malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase      Malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase   Malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase (, BioC ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + malonyl-CoA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + malonyl-CoA methyl ester   Malonyl-CoA O-methyltransferase is involved in an early step of biotin biosynthesis in Gram-negative bacteria .
