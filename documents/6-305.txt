   Complex Lie group      Complex Lie group   In geometry , a complex Lie group is a complex-analytic manifold that is also a group in such a way      G  √ó  G   ‚Üí  G   ,    (  x  ,  y  )   ‚Ü¶   x   y   -  1         formulae-sequence   normal-‚Üí    G  G   G    maps-to   x  y     x   superscript  y    1        G\times G\to G,(x,y)\mapsto xy^{-1}   is holomorphic. Basic examples are     GL  n    (  ‚ÑÇ  )       subscript  GL  n   ‚ÑÇ    \operatorname{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{C})   , the general linear groups over the complex numbers . A connected compact complex Lie group is precisely a complex torus (not to be confused with the complex Lie group    ‚ÑÇ  *     superscript  ‚ÑÇ     \mathbb{C}^{*}   ). Any finite group may be given the structure of a complex Lie group. A complex semisimple Lie group is an algebraic group .  Examples   A finite-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers (in particular, complex Lie algebra) is a complex Lie group in an obvious way.  A connected compact complex Lie group A of dimension g is of the form     ‚ÑÇ  g   /  L       superscript  ‚ÑÇ  g   L    \mathbb{C}^{g}/L   where L is a discrete subgroup. Indeed, its Lie algebra   ùîû   ùîû   \mathfrak{a}   can be shown to be abelian and then    exp  :   ùîû  ‚Üí  A      normal-:  exp   normal-‚Üí  ùîû  A     \operatorname{exp}:\mathfrak{a}\to A   is a surjective  morphism of complex Lie groups, showing A is of the form described.       ‚ÑÇ  ‚Üí   ‚ÑÇ  *    ,   z  ‚Ü¶   e  z       formulae-sequence   normal-‚Üí  ‚ÑÇ   superscript  ‚ÑÇ      maps-to  z   superscript  e  z      \mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}^{*},z\mapsto e^{z}   is an example of a morphism of complex Lie groups that does not come from a morphism of algebraic groups. Since     ‚ÑÇ  *   =    GL  1    (  ‚ÑÇ  )         superscript  ‚ÑÇ      subscript  GL  1   ‚ÑÇ     \mathbb{C}^{*}=\operatorname{GL}_{1}(\mathbb{C})   , this is also an example of a representation of a complex Lie group that is not algebraic.  Let X be a compact complex manifold. Then, as in the real case,    Aut   (  X  )      Aut  X    \operatorname{Aut}(X)   is a complex Lie group whose Lie algebra is    Œì   (  X  ,   T  X   )       normal-Œì   X    T  X      \Gamma(X,TX)   .  Let K be a connected compact Lie group . Then there exists a unique connected complex Lie group G such that (i)     Lie   (  G  )    =    Lie   (  K  )     ‚äó  ‚Ñù   ‚ÑÇ        Lie  G     subscript  tensor-product  ‚Ñù    Lie  K   ‚ÑÇ     \operatorname{Lie}(G)=\operatorname{Lie}(K)\otimes_{\mathbb{R}}\mathbb{C}   (ii) K is a maximal compact subgroup of G . It is called the complexification of K . For example,     GL  n    (  ‚ÑÇ  )       subscript  GL  n   ‚ÑÇ    \operatorname{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{C})   is the complexification of the unitary group . If K is acting on a compact k√§hler manifold X , then the action of K extends to that of G .   References      "  Category:Lie groups  Category:Manifolds
