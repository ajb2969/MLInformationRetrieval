Complex Lie group

In geometry, a complex Lie group is a complex-analytic manifold that is also a group in such a way 
 
 
 
  is holomorphic. Basic examples are 
 
 
 
 , the general linear groups over the complex numbers. A connected compact complex Lie group is precisely a complex torus (not to be confused with the complex Lie group 
 
 
 
 ). Any finite group may be given the structure of a complex Lie group. A complex semisimple Lie group is an algebraic group.
Examples

A finite-dimensional vector space over the complex numbers (in particular, complex Lie algebra) is a complex Lie group in an obvious way.
A connected compact complex Lie group A of dimension g is of the form 
 
 
 
 
  where L is a discrete subgroup. Indeed, its Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  can be shown to be abelian and then 
 
 
 
  is a surjective morphism of complex Lie groups, showing A is of the form described.


 
  is an example of a morphism of complex Lie groups that does not come from a morphism of algebraic groups. Since 
 
 
 
 , this is also an example of a representation of a complex Lie group that is not algebraic.
Let X be a compact complex manifold. Then, as in the real case, 
 
 
 
 
  is a complex Lie group whose Lie algebra is 
 
 
 
 .
Let K be a connected compact Lie group. Then there exists a unique connected complex Lie group G such that (i) 
 
 
 
  (ii) K is a maximal compact subgroup of G. It is called the complexification of K. For example, 
 
 
 
  is the complexification of the unitary group. If K is acting on a compact k√§hler manifold X, then the action of K extends to that of G.
