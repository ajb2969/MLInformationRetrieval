Biconditional introduction

In propositional logic, biconditional introduction123 is a valid rule of inference. It allows for one to infer a biconditional from two conditional statements. The rule makes it possible to introduce a biconditional statement into a logical proof. If 
 
 
 
  is true, and if 
 
 
 
  is true, then one may infer that 
 
 
 
  is true. For example, from the statements "if I'm breathing, then I'm alive" and "if I'm alive, then I'm breathing", it can be inferred that "I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive". Biconditional introduction is the converse of biconditional elimination. The rule can be stated formally as:



where the rule is that wherever instances of "
 
 
 
 " and "
 
 
 
 " appear on lines of a proof, "
 
 
 
 " can validly be placed on a subsequent line.
Formal notation
The biconditional introduction rule may be written in sequent notation:



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence when 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are both in a proof;
or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:



where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
