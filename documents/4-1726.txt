Linearization

In mathematics linearization refers to finding the linear approximation to a function at a given point. In the study of dynamical systems, linearization is a method for assessing the local stability of an equilibrium point of a system of nonlinear differential equations or discrete dynamical systems.1 This method is used in fields such as engineering, physics, economics, and ecology.
Linearization of a function
Linearizations of a function are lines—usually lines that can be used for purposes of calculation. Linearization is an effective method for approximating the output of a function 
 
 
 
  at any 
 
 
 
  based on the value and slope of the function at 
 
 
 
 , given that 
 
 
 
  is differentiable on 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
 ) and that 
 
 
 
  is close to 
 
 
 
 . In short, linearization approximates the output of a function near 
 
 
 
 .
For example, 
 
 
 
 . However, what would be a good approximation of 
 
 
 
 ?
For any given function 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  can be approximated if it is near a known differentiable point. The most basic requisite is that, where 
 
 
 
  is the linearization of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . The point-slope form of an equation forms an equation of a line, given a point 
 
 
 
  and slope 
 
 
 
 . The general form of this equation is
 
 
 
 .
Using the point 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  becomes 
 
 
 
 . Because differentiable functions are locally linear, the best slope to substitute in would be the slope of the line tangent to 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 .
While the concept of local linearity applies the most to points arbitrarily close to 
 
 
 
 , those relatively close work relatively well for linear approximations. The slope 
 
 
 
  should be, most accurately, the slope of the tangent line at 
 
 
 
 .
 Visually, the accompanying diagram shows the tangent line of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . At 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is any small positive or negative value, 
 
 
 
  is very nearly the value of the tangent line at the point 
 
 
 
 .
The final equation for the linearization of a function at 
 
 
 
  is:



For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . The derivative of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , and the slope of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
Example
To find 
 
 
 
 , we can use the fact that 
 
 
 
 . The linearization of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , because the function 
 
 
 
  defines the slope of the function 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . Substituting in 
 
 
 
 , the linearization at 4 is 
 
 
 
 . In this case 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
  is approximately 
 
 
 
 . The true value is close to 2.00024998, so the linearization approximation has a relative error of less than 1 millionth of a percent.
Linearization of a multivariable function
The equation for the linearization of a function 
 
 
 
  at a point 
 
 
 
  is:



The general equation for the linearization of a multivariable function 
 
 
 
  at a point 
 
 
 
  is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the vector of variables, and 
 
 
 
  is the linearization point of interest .2
Uses of linearization
Linearization makes it possible to use tools for studying nonlinear systems to analyze the behavior of a nonlinear function near a given point. The linearization of a function is the first order term of its Taylor expansion around the point of interest. For a system defined by the equation


 
 ,
the linearized system can be written as



where 
 
 
 
  is the point of interest and 
 
 
 
  is the Jacobian of 
 
 
 
  evaluated at 
 
 
 
 .
Stability analysis
In stability analysis of autonomous systems, one can use the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at a hyperbolic equilibrium point to determine the nature of that equilibrium. This is the content of linearization theorem. For time-varying systems, the linearization requires additional justification.3
Microeconomics
In microeconomics, decision rules may be approximated under the state-space approach to linearization.4 Under this approach, the Euler equations of the utility maximization problem are linearized around the stationary steady state.5 A unique solution to the resulting system of dynamic equations then is found.6
