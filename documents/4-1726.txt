   Linearization      Linearization   In mathematics  linearization refers to finding the linear approximation to a function at a given point. In the study of dynamical systems , linearization is a method for assessing the local stability of an equilibrium point of a system of nonlinear  differential equations or discrete dynamical systems . 1 This method is used in fields such as engineering , physics , economics , and ecology .  Linearization of a function  Linearizations of a function are lines —usually lines that can be used for purposes of calculation. Linearization is an effective method for approximating the output of a function    y  =   f   (  x  )        y    f  x     y=f(x)   at any    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   based on the value and slope of the function at    x  =  b      x  b    x=b   , given that    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is differentiable on    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   (or    [  b  ,  a  ]     b  a    [b,a]   ) and that   a   a   a   is close to   b   b   b   . In short, linearization approximates the output of a function near    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   .  For example,     4   =  2        4   2    \sqrt{4}=2   . However, what would be a good approximation of     4.001   =    4  +  .001          4.001       4  .001      \sqrt{4.001}=\sqrt{4+.001}   ?  For any given function    y  =   f   (  x  )        y    f  x     y=f(x)   ,    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   can be approximated if it is near a known differentiable point. The most basic requisite is that, where     L  a    (  x  )        subscript  L  a   x    L_{a}(x)   is the linearization of    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   at    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   ,      L  a    (  a  )    =   f   (  a  )           subscript  L  a   a     f  a     L_{a}(a)=f(a)   . The point-slope form of an equation forms an equation of a line, given a point    (  H  ,  K  )     H  K    (H,K)   and slope   M   M   M   . The general form of this equation is     y  -  K   =   M   (   x  -  H   )          y  K     M    x  H      y-K=M(x-H)   .  Using the point    (  a  ,   f   (  a  )    )     a    f  a     (a,f(a))   ,     L  a    (  x  )        subscript  L  a   x    L_{a}(x)   becomes    y  =    f   (  a  )    +   M   (   x  -  a   )         y      f  a     M    x  a       y=f(a)+M(x-a)   . Because differentiable functions are locally linear , the best slope to substitute in would be the slope of the line tangent to    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   at    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   .  While the concept of local linearity applies the most to points arbitrarily close to    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   , those relatively close work relatively well for linear approximations. The slope   M   M   M   should be, most accurately, the slope of the tangent line at    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   .  Visually, the accompanying diagram shows the tangent line of    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   at   x   x   x   . At    f   (   x  +  h   )       f    x  h     f(x+h)   , where   h   h   h   is any small positive or negative value,    f   (   x  +  h   )       f    x  h     f(x+h)   is very nearly the value of the tangent line at the point    (   x  +  h   ,   L   (   x  +  h   )    )       x  h     L    x  h      (x+h,L(x+h))   .  The final equation for the linearization of a function at    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   is:      y  =    f   (  a  )    +    f  ′    (  a  )    (   x  -  a   )         y      f  a      superscript  f  normal-′   a    x  a       y=f(a)+f^{\prime}(a)(x-a)\,     For    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   ,     f   (  a  )    =   f   (  x  )          f  a     f  x     f(a)=f(x)   . The derivative of    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   is     f  ′    (  x  )        superscript  f  normal-′   x    f^{\prime}(x)   , and the slope of    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   at   a   a   a   is     f  ′    (  a  )        superscript  f  normal-′   a    f^{\prime}(a)   .  Example  To find    4.001      4.001    \sqrt{4.001}   , we can use the fact that     4   =  2        4   2    \sqrt{4}=2   . The linearization of     f   (  x  )    =   x         f  x     x     f(x)=\sqrt{x}   at    x  =  a      x  a    x=a   is    y  =    a   +    1   2   a      (   x  -  a   )         y      a       1    2    a       x  a       y=\sqrt{a}+\frac{1}{2\sqrt{a}}(x-a)   , because the function      f  ′    (  x  )    =   1   2   x            superscript  f  normal-′   x     1    2    x       f^{\prime}(x)=\frac{1}{2\sqrt{x}}   defines the slope of the function     f   (  x  )    =   x         f  x     x     f(x)=\sqrt{x}   at   x   x   x   . Substituting in    a  =  4      a  4    a=4   , the linearization at 4 is    y  =   2  +    x  -  4   4        y    2      x  4   4      y=2+\frac{x-4}{4}   . In this case    x  =  4.001      x  4.001    x=4.001   , so    4.001      4.001    \sqrt{4.001}   is approximately     2  +    4.001  -  4   4    =  2.00025        2      4.001  4   4    2.00025    2+\frac{4.001-4}{4}=2.00025   . The true value is close to 2.00024998, so the linearization approximation has a relative error of less than 1 millionth of a percent.

 \cdot({\mathbf{x}}-{\mathbf{p}})     where   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   is the vector of variables, and   𝐩   𝐩   \mathbf{p}   is the linearization point of interest . 2  Uses of linearization  Linearization makes it possible to use tools for studying nonlinear systems to analyze the behavior of a nonlinear function near a given point. The linearization of a function is the first order term of its Taylor expansion around the point of interest. For a system defined by the equation        d  𝕩    d  t    =   𝔽   (  𝕩  ,  t  )            d  𝕩     d  t      𝔽   𝕩  t      \frac{d\mathbb{x}}{dt}=\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{x},t)   ,  the linearized system can be written as        d  𝕩    d  t    ≈    𝔽   (   𝕩  𝟘   ,  t  )    +    D  𝔽   (   𝕩  𝟘   ,  t  )    ⋅   (   𝕩  -   𝕩  𝟘    )             d  𝕩     d  t        𝔽    subscript  𝕩  0   t     normal-⋅    D  𝔽    subscript  𝕩  0   t      𝕩   subscript  𝕩  0        \frac{d\mathbb{x}}{dt}\approx\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{x_{0}},t)+D\mathbb{F}(\mathbb{%

Stability analysis  In stability analysis of autonomous systems , one can use the eigenvalues of the Jacobian matrix evaluated at a hyperbolic equilibrium point to determine the nature of that equilibrium. This is the content of linearization theorem . For time-varying systems, the linearization requires additional justification. 3  Microeconomics  In microeconomics , decision rules may be approximated under the state-space approach to linearization. 4 Under this approach, the Euler equations of the utility maximization problem are linearized around the stationary steady state. 5 A unique solution to the resulting system of dynamic equations then is found. 6  See also   Linear stability  Tangent stiffness matrix  Stability derivatives  Linearization theorem  Taylor approximation  Functional equation (L-function)   References  External links  Linearization tutorials   Linearization for Model Analysis and Control Design   "  Category:Differential calculus  Category:Dynamical systems     The linearization problem in complex dimension one dynamical systems at Scholarpedia ↩  Linearization.
