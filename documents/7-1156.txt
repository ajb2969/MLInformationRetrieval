   Great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron      Great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron   In geometry , the great ditrigonal icosidodecahedron is a nonconvex uniform polyhedron , indexed as U 47 . It has extended Schläfli symbol a{5/2,3} or c{3,5/2}, as an altered great stellated dodecahedron or converted great icosahedron , and Coxeter diagram . It has 4 Schwarz triangle equivalent constructions, for example Wythoff symbol  3 | 3/2 5 , and Coxeter diagram .  Its circumradius is     3   2        3   2    \frac{\sqrt{3}}{2}   times the length of its edge, 1 a value it shares with the cube .  Related polyhedra  Its convex hull is a regular dodecahedron . It additionally shares its edge arrangement with the small ditrigonal icosidodecahedron (having the triangular faces in common), the ditrigonal dodecadodecahedron (having the pentagonal faces in common), and the regular compound of five cubes .
