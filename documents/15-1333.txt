DTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose N,N-dimethyltransferase

DTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose N,N-dimethyltransferase (, RavNMT) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:dTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose 3-N,N-dimethyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + dTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose 
 
 
 
  2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + dTDP-3-dimethylamino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranose
 

The enzyme is involved in the synthesis of dTDP-D-ravidosamine.
