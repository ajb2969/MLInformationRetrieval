   Milnor conjecture (topology)      Milnor conjecture (topology)   In knot theory , the Milnor conjecture says that the slice genus of the    (  p  ,  q  )     p  q    (p,q)    torus knot is        (   p  -  1   )    (   q  -  1   )    /  2.          p  1     q  1    2.    (p-1)(q-1)/2.     It is in a similar vein to the Thom conjecture .  It was first proved by gauge theoretic methods by Peter Kronheimer and Tomasz Mrowka . 1  Jacob Rasmussen later gave a purely combinatorial proof using Khovanov homology , by means of the s-invariant . 2  References  "  Category:Geometric topology  Category:Knot theory  Category:4-manifolds  Category:Conjectures     . ↩  . ↩
