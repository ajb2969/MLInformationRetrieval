Milnor conjecture (topology)

In knot theory, the Milnor conjecture says that the slice genus of the 
 
 
torus knot is



It is in a similar vein to the Thom conjecture.
It was first proved by gauge theoretic methods by Peter Kronheimer and Tomasz Mrowka.1 Jacob Rasmussen later gave a purely combinatorial proof using Khovanov homology, by means of the s-invariant.2
