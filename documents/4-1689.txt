   Birch–Murnaghan equation of state      Birch–Murnaghan equation of state   The Birch–Murnaghan isothermal equation of state , published in 1947 by Francis Birch of Harvard , is a relationship between the volume of a body and the pressure to which it is subjected. This equation is named after Albert Francis Birch and Francis Dominic Murnaghan . Birch proposed this equation in a publication in 1947, based on the work of the Murnaghan of Johns Hopkins University published in 1944.  Expressions for the equation of state  The third-order Birch–Murnaghan isothermal equation of state is given by:        P   (  V  )    =     3   B  0    2    [     (    V  0   V   )    7  3    -    (    V  0   V   )    5  3     ]    {   1  +    3  4    (    B  0  ′   -  4   )    [     (    V  0   V   )    2  3    -  1   ]     }     .

 \frac{V_{0}}{V}\right)^{\frac{5}{3}}\right]\left\{1+\frac{3}{4}\left(B_{0}^{%
 \prime}-4\right)\left[\left(\frac{V_{0}}{V}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}-1\right]%
 \right\}.   where P is the pressure, V 0 is the reference volume, V is the deformed volume, B 0 is the bulk modulus, and B 0 ' is the derivative of the bulk modulus with respect to pressure. The bulk modulus and its derivative are usually obtained from fits to experimental data and are defined as       B  0   =   -   V    (    ∂  P    ∂  V    )    P  =  0           subscript  B  0       V   subscript      P     V      P  0        B_{0}=-V\left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_{P=0}   and       B  0  ′   =    (    ∂  B    ∂  P    )    P  =  0         superscript   subscript  B  0   normal-′    subscript      B     P      P  0      B_{0}^{\prime}=\left(\frac{\partial B}{\partial P}\right)_{P=0}   The expression for the equation of state is obtained by expanding the free energy f in the form of a series:       f  =    1  2    [     (   V   V  0    )    -   2  3     -  1   ]     .      f      1  2    delimited-[]     superscript    V   subscript  V  0        2  3     1       f=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left(\frac{V}{V_{0}}\right)^{-\frac{2}{3}}-1\right]\,.     The internal energy, E ( V ), is found by integration of the pressure:        E   (  V  )    =    E  0   +     9   V  0    B  0    16    {      [     (    V  0   V   )    2  3    -  1   ]   3    B  0  ′    +     [     (    V  0   V   )    2  3    -  1   ]   2    [   6  -   4    (    V  0   V   )    2  3      ]     }      .
