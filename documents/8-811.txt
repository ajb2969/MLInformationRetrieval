   Generator matrix      Generator matrix   In coding theory , a generator matrix is a matrix whose rows form a basis for a linear code . The codewords are all of the linear combinations of the rows of this matrix, that is, the linear code is the row space of its generator matrix.  Terminology  If G is a matrix, it generates the codewords of a linear code C by,   w = s  G ,   where w is a codeword of the linear code C , and s is any vector. A generator matrix for a linear     [  n  ,  k  ,  d  ]   q     subscript   n  k  d   q    [n,k,d]_{q}   -code has format    k  ×  n      k  n    k\times n   , where n is the length of a codeword, k is the number of information bits (the dimension of C as a vector subspace), d is the minimum distance of the code, and q is size of the finite field , that is, the number of symbols in the alphabet (thus, q = 2 indicates a binary code , etc.). The number of redundant bits is denoted by r = n - k .  The standard form for a generator matrix is, 1      G  =   [       I  k   |  P      ]       G     fragments   subscript  I  k   normal-|  P       G=\begin{bmatrix}I_{k}|P\end{bmatrix}   , where    I  k     subscript  I  k    I_{k}   is the k × k  identity matrix and P is a k × r matrix. When the generator matrix is in standard form, the code C is systematic in its first k coordinate positions. 2  A generator matrix can be used to construct the parity check matrix for a code (and vice versa). If the generator matrix G is in standard form,    G  =   [       I  k   |  P      ]       G     fragments   subscript  I  k   normal-|  P       G=\begin{bmatrix}I_{k}|P\end{bmatrix}   , then the parity check matrix for C is 3      H  =   [      -   P  ⊤   |   I   n  -  k        ]       H     fragments    superscript  P  top   normal-|   subscript  I    n  k         H=\begin{bmatrix}-P^{\top}|I_{n-k}\end{bmatrix}   , where    P  ⊤     superscript  P  top    P^{\top}   is the transpose of the matrix   P   P   P   . This is a consequence of the fact that a parity check matrix of   C   C   C   is a generator matrix of the dual code     C  ⟂     superscript  C  perpendicular-to    C^{\perp}   .  Equivalent Codes  Codes C 1 and C 2 are equivalent (denoted C 1 ~ C 2 ) if one code can be obtained from the other via the following two transformations: 4   arbitrarily permute the components, and  independently scale by a non-zero element any components.   Equivalent codes have the same minimum distance.  The generator matrices of equivalent codes can be obtained from one another via the following elementary operations : 5   permute rows  scale rows by a nonzero scalar  add rows to other rows  permute columns, and  scale columns by a nonzero scalar.   Thus, we can perform Gaussian Elimination on G . Indeed, this allows us to assume that the generator matrix is in the standard form. More precisely, for any matrix G we can find a invertible matrix  U such that     U  G   =   [       I  k   |  P      ]         U  G      fragments   subscript  I  k   normal-|  P       UG=\begin{bmatrix}I_{k}|P\end{bmatrix}   , where G and    [       I  k   |  P      ]       fragments   subscript  I  k   normal-|  P      \begin{bmatrix}I_{k}|P\end{bmatrix}   generate equivalent codes.
