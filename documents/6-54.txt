K-function

In mathematics, the K-function, typically denoted K(z), is a generalization of the hyperfactorial to complex numbers, similar to the generalization of the factorial to the Gamma function.
Formally, the K-function is defined as



It can also be given in closed form as



where ζ'(z) denotes the derivative of the Riemann zeta function, ζ(a,z) denotes the Hurwitz zeta function and



Another expression using polygamma function is1



Or using balanced generalization of Polygamma function:2




where A is Glaisher constant.
 

The K-function is closely related to the Gamma function and the Barnes G-function; for natural numbers n, we have



More prosaically, one may write



The first values are

1, 4, 108, 27648, 86400000, 4031078400000, 3319766398771200000, ... ().
