Rauch comparison theorem

In Riemannian geometry, the Rauch comparison theorem, named after Harry Rauch who proved it in 1951, is a fundamental result which relates the sectional curvature of a Riemannian manifold to the rate at which geodesics spread apart. Intuitively, it states that for positive curvature, geodesics tend to converge, while for negative curvature, geodesics tend to spread. This theorem is formulated using Jacobi fields to measure the variation in geodesics.
Statement of the Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be Riemannian manifolds, let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be unit speed geodesic segments such that 
 
 
 
  has no conjugate points along 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be normal Jacobi fields along 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that the sectional curvatures of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  satisfy 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
  is a 2-plane containing 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a 2-plane containing 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
