   Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase      Caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a caffeoyl-CoA O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + caffeoyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + feruloyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and caffeoyl-CoA , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and feruloyl-CoA . A large number of natural products are generated via a step involving this enzyme. 1  This enzyme is classified to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include caffeoyl coenzyme A methyltransferase , caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase , and trans-caffeoyl-CoA 3-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid  biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
