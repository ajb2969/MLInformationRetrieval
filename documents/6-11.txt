Generalized Newtonian fluid




Generalized Newtonian fluid

A generalized Newtonian fluid is an idealized fluid for which the shear stress is a function of shear rate at the particular time, but not dependent upon the history of deformation. Despite this type of fluid is non-Newtonian (i.e. non-linear) in nature, its constitutive equation is a generalised form of the Newtonian fluid. Generalised Newtonian fluids satisfy the following rheological equation:



where 
 
 
 
  is the shear stress, and 
 
 
 
  the shear rate. The quantity 
 
 
 
 
  represents an apparent or effective viscosity as a function of the shear rate.
The most commonly used types of generalized Newtonian fluids are:1

Power-law fluid
Cross fluid
Carreau fluid
Second-order fluid
