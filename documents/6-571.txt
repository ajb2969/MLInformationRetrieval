   Borel summation      Borel summation   In mathematics, Borel summation is a summation method for divergent series , introduced by . It is particularly useful for summing divergent asymptotic series, and in some sense gives the best possible sum for such series. There are several variations of this method that are also called Borel summation, and a generalization of it called Mittag-Leffler summation .  Definition  There are (at least) three slightly different methods called Borel summation. They differ in which series they can sum, but are consistent, meaning that if two of the methods sum the same series they give the same answer.  Throughout let A(z) denote a formal power series       A   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    z  k           A  z     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       A(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}   ,  and define the Borel transform of A to be its equivalent exponential series        ℬ  A   (  t  )    ≡    ∑   k  =  0   ∞      a  k    k  !     t  k      .        ℬ  A  t     superscript   subscript     k  0           subscript  a  k     k     superscript  t  k       \mathcal{B}A(t)\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{k}}{k!}t^{k}.     Borel's exponential summation method  Let A n (z) denote the partial sum         A  n    (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   n     a  k    z  k      .         subscript  A  n   z     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       A_{n}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}a_{k}z^{k}.     A weak form of Borel's summation method defines the Borel sum of A to be        lim   t  →  ∞      e   -  t      ∑   n  =  0   ∞      t  n    n  !     A  n    (  z  )       .      subscript    normal-→  t        superscript  e    t      superscript   subscript     n  0           superscript  t  n     n     subscript  A  n   z       \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}e^{-t}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{t^{n}}{n!}A_{n}(z).     If this converges at z ∈ C to some a(z) , we say that the weak Borel sum of A converges at z , and write     ∑    a  k    z  k     =   a   (  z  )    (   𝒘  𝑩   )             subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       a  z    𝒘  𝑩      {\textstyle\sum}a_{k}z^{k}=a(z)\,(\boldsymbol{wB})   .  Borel's integral summation method  Suppose that the Borel transform converges for all real numbers to a function growing sufficiently slowly that the following integral is well defined (as an improper integral), the Borel sum of A is given by        ∫  0  ∞     e   -  t    ℬ  A   (   t  z   )   d  t    .      superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    t    ℬ  A    t  z   d  t     \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}\mathcal{B}A(tz)\,dt.     If the integral converges at z ∈ C to some a(z) , we say that the Borel sum of A converges at z , and write     ∑    a  k    z  k     =   a   (  z  )    (  𝑩  )             subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       a  z  𝑩     {\textstyle\sum}a_{k}z^{k}=a(z)\,(\boldsymbol{B})   .  Borel's integral summation method with analytic continuation  This is similar to Borel's integral summation method, except that the Borel transform need not converge for all t , but converges to an analytic function of t near 0 that can be analytically continued along the positive real axis .  Basic properties  Regularity  The methods ( B ) and ( wB ) are both regular summation methods, meaning that whenever A(z) converges (in the standard sense), then the Borel sum and weak Borel sum also converge, and do so to the same value. i.e.          ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    z  k     =   A   (  z  )    <  ∞     ⇒    ∑    a  k    z  k       =   A   (  z  )    (  𝑩  ,   𝒘  𝑩   )      .     formulae-sequence        superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       A  z              normal-⇒       subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k        A  z   𝑩    𝒘  𝑩        \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}=A(z)<\infty\quad\Rightarrow\quad{\textstyle\sum}%
 a_{k}z^{k}=A(z)\,\,(\boldsymbol{B},\,\boldsymbol{wB}).     Regularity of ( B ) is easily seen by a change in order of integration: if A(z) is convergent at z ,then        A   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    z  k     =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    (    ∫  0  ∞     e   -  t     t  k   d  t    )     z  k    k  !      =    ∫  0  ∞     e   -  t      ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k      (   t  z   )   k    k  !    d  t       ,          A  z     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k            superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    t     superscript  t  k   d  t       superscript  z  k     k             superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    t      superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k      superscript    t  z   k     k    d  t         A(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z^{k}=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}\left(\int_{0}^{%
 \infty}e^{-t}t^{k}dt\right)\frac{z^{k}}{k!}=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}\sum_{k=0}^%
 {\infty}a_{k}\frac{(tz)^{k}}{k!}dt,     where the rightmost expression is exactly the Borel sum at z .  Regularity of ( B ) and ( wB ) imply that these methods provide analytic extensions to A(z) .  Equivalence of Borel and weak Borel summation  Any series A(z) that is weak Borel summable at z ∈ C is also Borel summable at z . However, one can construct examples of series which are divergent under weak Borel summation, but which are Borel summable. The following theorem characterises the equivalence of the two methods.   Theorem ().  Let A(z) be a formal power series, and fix z ∈ C , then:  If     ∑    a  k    z  k     =   a   (  z  )    (   𝒘  𝑩   )             subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       a  z    𝒘  𝑩      {\textstyle\sum}a_{k}z^{k}=a(z)\,(\boldsymbol{wB})   , then     ∑    a  k    z  k     =   a   (  z  )    (  𝑩  )             subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       a  z  𝑩     {\textstyle\sum}a_{k}z^{k}=a(z)\,(\boldsymbol{B})   .  If     ∑    a  k    z  k     =   a   (  z  )    (  𝑩  )             subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       a  z  𝑩     {\textstyle\sum}a_{k}z^{k}=a(z)\,(\boldsymbol{B})   , and       lim   t  →  ∞      e   -  t    ℬ  A   (   z  t   )     =  0   ,        subscript    normal-→  t        superscript  e    t    ℬ  A    z  t     0    \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}e^{-t}\mathcal{B}A(zt)=0,   then     ∑    a  k    z  k     =   a   (  z  )    (   𝒘  𝑩   )             subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       a  z    𝒘  𝑩      {\textstyle\sum}a_{k}z^{k}=a(z)\,(\boldsymbol{wB})   .     Relationship to other summation methods   ( B ) is the special case of Mittag-Leffler summation with α = 1.  ( wB ) can be seen as the limiting case of generalized Euler summation method ( E ,q) in the sense that as q → ∞ the domain of convergence of the ( E ,q) method converges up to the domain of convergence for ( B ). 1   Uniqueness theorems  There are always many different functions with any given asymptotic expansion. However there is sometimes a best possible function, in the sense that the errors in the finite-dimensional approximations are as small as possible in some region. Watson's theorem and Carleman's theorem show that Borel summation produces such a best possible sum of the series.  Watson's theorem  Watson's theorem gives conditions for a function to be the Borel sum of its asymptotic series. Suppose that f is a function satisfying the following conditions:   f is holomorphic in some region | z |< R , |arg( z )| < π/2 + ε for some positive R and ε.  In this region f has an asymptotic series a 0 + a 1 z +... with the property that the error       |    f   (  z  )    -   a  0   -    a  1   z   -  ⋯  -    a   n  -  1     z   n  -  1      |          f  z    subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1   z   normal-⋯     subscript  a    n  1     superscript  z    n  1        |f(z)-a_{0}-a_{1}z-\cdots-a_{n-1}z^{n-1}|   is bounded by       C   n  +  1     n  !    z  n        superscript  C    n  1      n    superscript  z  n     C^{n+1}n!z^{n}   for all z in the region (for some positive constant C ).  Then Watson's theorem says that in this region f is given by the Borel sum of its asymptotic series. More precisely, the series for the Borel transform converges in a neighborhood of the origin, and can be analytically continued to the positive real axis, and the integral defining the Borel sum converges to f ( z ) for z in the region above.  Slightly more generally, f is determined by its asymptotic series if the n ! in the error estimate above is replaced by kn ! provided the condition |arg( z )| 0 and | f ( z )| n z | n in this region for all n , then f is zero provided that the series 1/ b 0 + 1/ b 1 + ... diverges.  Carleman's theorem gives a summation method for any asymptotic series whose terms do not grow too fast, as the sum can be defined to be the unique function with this asymptotic series in a suitable sector if it exists. Borel summation is slightly weaker than special case of this when b n = c / n for some constant c . More generally one can define summation methods slightly stronger than Borel's by taking the numbers b n to be slightly larger, for example b n = cn log n or b n = cn log n log log n . In practice this generalization is of little use, as there are almost no natural examples of series summable by this method that cannot also be summed by Borel's method.  Example  The function f ( z )=exp(–1/ z ) has the asymptotic series 0 + 0 z + ... with an error bound of the form above in the region |arg( z )|<θ for any θ<π/2, but is not given by the Borel sum of its asymptotic series. This shows that the number π/2 in Watson's theorem cannot be replaced by any smaller number (unless the bound on the error is made smaller).  Examples  The geometric series  Consider the geometric series        A   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞    z  k     ,        A  z     superscript   subscript     k  0       superscript  z  k      A(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}z^{k},     which converges (in the standard sense) to 1/(1 − z ) for | z | \mathcal{B}A(t) \equiv \sum_{k=0}^\infty \frac{1}{k!}t^k = e^t,  from which we obtain the Borel sum        ∫  0  ∞     e   -  t    ℬ  A   (   t  z   )   d  t    =    ∫  0  ∞     e   -  t      e   t  z     d  t    =   1   1  -  z            superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    t    ℬ  A    t  z   d  t      superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    t     superscript  e    t  z    d  t           1    1  z       \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}\mathcal{B}A(tz)\,dt=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t}e^{tz}\,dt=%
 \frac{1}{1-z}     which converges in the larger region Re( z ) N(z) = (1-z N+1 )/(1-z)'', and so the weak Borel sum is         lim   t  →  ∞      e   -  t      ∑   n  =  0   ∞      1  -   z   n  +  1      1  -  z      t  n    n  !        =    lim   t  →  ∞       e   -  t     1  -  z     (    e  t   -   z   e   t  z      )     =   1   1  -  z     ,          subscript    normal-→  t        superscript  e    t      superscript   subscript     n  0            1   superscript  z    n  1       1  z       superscript  t  n     n          subscript    normal-→  t          superscript  e    t      1  z       superscript  e  t     z   superscript  e    t  z               1    1  z       \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}e^{-t}\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{1-z^{n+1}}{1-z}\frac{t%

 \frac{1}{1-z},     where, again, convergence is on Re( z )  \lim_{t \rightarrow \infty} e^{-t} (\mathcal{B} A)(zt) = e^{t(z-1)} = 0.  An alternating factorial series  Consider the series        A   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     k  !     (   -   1  ⋅  z    )   k      ,        A  z     superscript   subscript     k  0          k    superscript     normal-⋅  1  z    k       A(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}k!\left(-1\cdot z\right)^{k},     then A(z) does not converge for any nonzero z ∈ C . The Borel transform is       ℬ  A   (  t  )    ≡    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     (   -   1  ⋅  t    )   k    =   1   1  +  t            ℬ  A  t     superscript   subscript     k  0       superscript     normal-⋅  1  t    k           1    1  t       \mathcal{B}A(t)\equiv\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(-1\cdot t\right)^{k}=\frac{1}{1+t}     for | t | \int_0^\infty e^{-t}\mathcal{B}A(tz) \, dt = \int_0^\infty \frac{e^{-t}} {1+tz} \, dt = \frac 1 z \cdot e^\frac 1 z \cdot \Gamma\left(0,\frac 1 z \right)  (where Γ is the incomplete Gamma function ).  This integral converges for all z ≥ 0, so the original divergent series is Borel summable for all such z . This function has an asymptotic expansion as z tends to 0 that is given by the original divergent series. This is a typical example of the fact that Borel summation will sometimes "correctly" sum divergent asymptotic expansions.  Again, since         lim   t  →  ∞      e   -  t     (   ℬ  A   )    (   z  t   )     =    lim   t  →  ∞      e   -  t     1  +   z  t      =  0   ,          subscript    normal-→  t        superscript  e    t      ℬ  A     z  t       subscript    normal-→  t        superscript  e    t      1    z  t           0     \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}e^{-t}(\mathcal{B}A)(zt)=\lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}%
 \frac{e^{-t}}{1+zt}=0,     for all z , the equivalence theorem ensures that weak Borel summation has the same domain of convergence, z ≥ 0.  An example in which equivalence fails  The following example extends on that given in . Consider        A   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     (    ∑   l  =  0   ∞       (   -  1   )   l     (    2  l   +  2   )   k      (    2  l   +  1   )   !     )    z  k      .        A  z     superscript   subscript     k  0          superscript   subscript     l  0           superscript    1   l    superscript      2  l   2   k          2  l   1       superscript  z  k       A(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(\sum_{l=0}^{\infty}\frac{(-1)^{l}(2l+2)^{k}}{(2l%
 +1)!}\right)z^{k}.     After changing the order of summation, the Borel transform is given by      ℬ  A   (  t  )       ℬ  A  t    \displaystyle\mathcal{B}A(t)     At z = 2 the Borel sum is given by         ∫  0  ∞     e  t    sin   (   e   2  t    )    d  t    =    ∫  1  ∞     sin   (   u  2   )    d  u    =     π   8   -   S   (  1  )     <  ∞   ,          superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e  t      superscript  e    2  t     d  t      superscript   subscript   1          superscript  u  2    d  u               π   8     S  1             \int_{0}^{\infty}e^{t}\sin(e^{2t})dt=\int_{1}^{\infty}\sin(u^{2})du=\frac{%
 \sqrt{\pi}}{8}-S(1)<\infty,     where S(x) is the Fresnel integral . Via the convergence theorem along chords, the Borel integral converges for all z ≤ 2 (clearly the integral diverges for z > 2).  For the weak Borel sum we note that        lim   t  →  ∞      e    (   z  -  1   )   t     sin   (   e   z  t    )      =  0        subscript    normal-→  t        superscript  e      z  1   t       superscript  e    z  t       0    \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}e^{(z-1)t}\sin\left(e^{zt}\right)=0     holds only for z 0'' ∈ C , then it is also Borel summable at all points on the chord Oz 0 connecting z 0 to the origin. Moreover, there exists a function a(z) analytic throughout the disk with radius Oz 0 such that         ∑    a  k    z  k      =   a   (  z  )    (  𝑩  )     ,           subscript  a  k    superscript  z  k       a  z  𝑩     {\textstyle\sum}a_{k}z^{k}=a(z)\,(\boldsymbol{B}),     for all z = θ z 0 , θ ∈ [0,1].  An immediate consequence is that the domain of convergence of the Borel sum is a star domain in C . More can be said about the domain of convergence of the Borel sum, than that it is a star domain, which is referred to as the Borel polygon, and is determined by the singularities of the series A(z) .  The Borel polygon  Suppose that A(z) has strictly positive radius of convergence, so that it is analytic in a non-trivial region containing the origin, and let S A denote the set of singularities of A . This means that P ∈ S A if and only if A can be continued analytically along the open chord from 0 to P , but not to P itself. For P ∈ S A , let L P denote the line passing through P which is perpendicular to the chord OP . Define the sets        Π  P   =   {   z  ∈   ℂ    :     O  z   ∩   L  P    =  ∅   }    ,       subscript  normal-Π  P    conditional-set    z  ℂ         O  z    subscript  L  P         \Pi_{P}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,\colon\,Oz\cap L_{P}=\varnothing\},     the set of points which lie on the same side of L P as the origin. The Borel polygon of A is the set        Π  A   =   cl   (    ⋂   P  ∈   S  A      Π  P    )     .       subscript  normal-Π  A     cl    subscript     P   subscript  S  A      subscript  normal-Π  P       \Pi_{A}=\text{cl}\Big(\bigcap_{P\in S_{A}}\Pi_{P}\Big).     An alternative definition was used by Borel and Phragmén . Let    S  ⊂  ℂ      S  ℂ    S\subset\mathbb{C}   denote the largest star domain on which there is an analytic extension of A , then    Π  A     subscript  normal-Π  A    \Pi_{A}   is the largest subset of   S   S   S   such that for all    P  ∈   Π  A       P   subscript  normal-Π  A     P\in\Pi_{A}   the interior of the circle with diameter OP is contained in   S   S   S   . Referring to the set    Π  A     subscript  normal-Π  A    \Pi_{A}   as a polygon is somewhat of a misnomer, since the set need not be polygonal at all; if, however, A(z) has only finitely many singularities then    Π  A     subscript  normal-Π  A    \Pi_{A}   will in fact be a polygon.  The following theorem, due to Borel and Phragmén provides convergence criteria for Borel summation.   Theorem .  The series A(z) is ( B ) summable at all    z  ∈   int   (   Π  A   )        z    int   subscript  normal-Π  A      z\in\text{int}(\Pi_{A})   , and is ( B ) divergent at all    z  ∈   ℂ  \   Π  A        z   normal-\  ℂ   subscript  normal-Π  A      z\in\mathbb{C}\backslash\Pi_{A}   .   Note that ( B ) summability for    z  ∈   ∂   Π  A        z     subscript  normal-Π  A      z\in\partial\Pi_{A}   depends on the nature of the point.  Example 1  Let ω i ∈ C denote the m -th roots of unity, i =1,... m , and consider      A   (  z  )       A  z    \displaystyle A(z)     which converges on B (0,1) ⊂ C . Seen as a function on C , A(z) has singularities at S A = {ω i : i = 1,... m }, and consequently the Borel polygon    Π  A     subscript  normal-Π  A    \Pi_{A}   is given by the regular m-gon centred at the origin, and such that 1 ∈ C is a midpoint of an edge.  Example 2  The formal series        A   (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞    z   2  k      ,        A  z     superscript   subscript     k  0       superscript  z   superscript  2  k       A(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}z^{2^{k}},     converges for all     |  z  |   <  1        z   1    |z|<1   (for instance, by the comparison test with the geometric series). It can however be shown 2 that A does not converge for all points z ∈ C with z 2 n = 1. Since the set of such z is dense in the unit circle, there can be no analytic extension of A outside of B(0,1) . Subsequently the largest star domain to which A can be analytically extended is S = B(0,1) from which (via the second definition) one obtains     Π  A   =   B   (  0  ,  1  )         subscript  normal-Π  A     B   0  1      \Pi_{A}=B(0,1)   . In particular we see that the Borel polygon is in fact not polygonal.  A Tauberian Theorem  A Tauberian theorem provides conditions under which convergence of one summation method, implies convergence under another method. The principal Tauberian theorem 3 for Borel summation provides conditions under which the weak Borel method implies convergence of the series.   Theorem . :If A is ( wB ) summable at z 0 ∈ C ,     ∑    a  k    z  0  k     =   a   (   z  0   )    (   𝒘  𝑩   )             subscript  a  k    superscript   subscript  z  0   k       a   subscript  z  0     𝒘  𝑩      {\textstyle\sum}a_{k}z_{0}^{k}=a(z_{0})\,(\boldsymbol{wB})   , and             a  k    z  0  k    =   O   (   k   -    1  2      )     ,    ∀  k   ≥  0    ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  a  k    superscript   subscript  z  0   k      O   superscript  k      1  2          for-all  k   0     a_{k}z_{0}^{k}=O\left(k^{-{\textstyle\frac{1}{2}}}\right),\qquad\forall k\geq 0,         then      ∑   k  =  0   ∞     a  k    z  0  k     =   a   (   z  0   )          superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  a  k    superscript   subscript  z  0   k       a   subscript  z  0      \sum_{k=0}^{\infty}a_{k}z_{0}^{k}=a(z_{0})   , and the series converges for all |z|0| .   Applications  Borel summation finds application in perturbation expansions in quantum field theory. In particular in 2-dimensional Euclidean field theory the Schwinger functions can often be recovered from their perturbation series using Borel summation . Some of the singularities of the Borel transform are related to instantons and renormalons in quantum field theory .  Generalizations  Borel summation requires that the coefficients do not grow too fast: more precisely, a n has to be bounded by n ! C n +1 for some C . There is a variation of Borel summation that replaces factorials n ! with (kn) ! for some positive integer k , which allows the summation of some series with a n bounded by (kn) ! C n +1 for some C . This generalization is similar to ordinary Borel summation.
