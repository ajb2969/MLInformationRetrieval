   Vector measure      Vector measure   In mathematics , a vector measure is a function defined on a family of sets and taking vector values satisfying certain properties. It is a generalization of the concept of finite measure , which takes nonnegative  real values only.  Definitions and first consequences  Given a field of sets     (  Ω  ,  ℱ  )     normal-Ω  ℱ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F})   and a Banach space    X   X   X   , a finitely additive vector measure (or measure , for short) is a function    μ  :   ℱ  →  X      normal-:  μ   normal-→  ℱ  X     \mu:\mathcal{F}\to X   such that for any two disjoint sets    A   A   A   and   B   B   B   in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   one has        μ   (   A  ∪  B   )    =    μ   (  A  )    +   μ   (  B  )      .        μ    A  B        μ  A     μ  B      \mu(A\cup B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B).     A vector measure   μ   μ   \mu   is called countably additive if for any sequence      (   A  i   )    i  =  1   ∞     superscript   subscript   subscript  A  i     i  1       (A_{i})_{i=1}^{\infty}   of disjoint sets in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   such that their union is in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   it holds that       μ   (    ⋃   i  =  1   ∞    A  i    )    =    ∑   i  =  1   ∞    μ   (   A  i   )           μ    superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  A  i       superscript   subscript     i  1        μ   subscript  A  i       \mu\left(\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A_{i}\right)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{i})     with the series on the right-hand side convergent in the norm of the Banach space    X  .    X   X.     It can be proved that an additive vector measure   μ   μ   \mu   is countably additive if and only if for any sequence     (   A  i   )    i  =  1   ∞     superscript   subscript   subscript  A  i     i  1       (A_{i})_{i=1}^{\infty}   as above one has        lim   n  →  ∞     ∥   μ   (    ⋃   i  =  n   ∞    A  i    )    ∥    =   0  ,   (  *  )          subscript    normal-→  n      norm    μ    superscript   subscript     i  n       subscript  A  i        0      \lim_{n\to\infty}\left\|\mu\left(\displaystyle\bigcup_{i=n}^{\infty}A_{i}%
 \right)\right\|=0,\quad\quad\quad(*)     where    ∥  ⋅  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to    \|\cdot\|   is the norm on    X  .    X   X.     Countably additive vector measures defined on sigma-algebras are more general than finite measures , finite signed measures , and complex measures , which are countably additive functions taking values respectively on the real interval     [  0  ,  ∞  )   ,     0     [0,\infty),   the set of real numbers , and the set of complex numbers .  Examples  Consider the field of sets made up of the interval    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   together with the family   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   of all Lebesgue measurable sets contained in this interval. For any such set   A   A   A   , define       μ   (  A  )    =    χ  A          μ  A    subscript  χ  A     \mu(A)=\chi_{A}\,     where   χ   χ   \chi   is the indicator function of    A  .    A   A.   Depending on where   μ   μ   \mu   is declared to take values, we get two different outcomes.       μ  ,    μ   \mu,   viewed as a function from   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   to the L p -space       L  ∞    (   [  0  ,  1  ]   )    ,       superscript  L     0  1     L^{\infty}([0,1]),   is a vector measure which is not countably-additive.        μ  ,    μ   \mu,   viewed as a function from   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   to the L p -space      L  1    (   [  0  ,  1  ]   )    ,       superscript  L  1    0  1     L^{1}([0,1]),   is a countably-additive vector measure.   Both of these statements follow quite easily from the criterion (*) stated above.  The variation of a vector measure  Given a vector measure     μ  :   ℱ  →  X    ,     normal-:  μ   normal-→  ℱ  X     \mu:\mathcal{F}\to X,   the variation     |  μ  |      μ    |\mu|   of   μ   μ   \mu   is defined as        |  μ  |    (  A  )    =   sup    ∑   i  =  1   n    ∥   μ   (   A  i   )    ∥             μ   A    supremum    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    norm    μ   subscript  A  i         |\mu|(A)=\sup\sum_{i=1}^{n}\|\mu(A_{i})\|     where the supremum is taken over all the partitions      A  =    ⋃   i  =  1   n    A  i        A    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  A  i      A=\bigcup_{i=1}^{n}A_{i}     of   A   A   A   into a finite number of disjoint sets, for all   A   A   A   in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   . Here,    ∥  ⋅  ∥     fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅  parallel-to    \|\cdot\|   is the norm on    X  .    X   X.     The variation of   μ   μ   \mu   is a finitely additive function taking values in     [  0  ,  ∞  ]   .     0     [0,\infty].   It holds that       ||   μ   (  A  )    ||   ≤    |  μ  |    (  A  )         norm    μ  A        μ   A     ||\mu(A)||\leq|\mu|(A)     for any   A   A   A   in    ℱ  .    ℱ   \mathcal{F}.   If     |  μ  |    (  Ω  )         μ   normal-Ω    |\mu|(\Omega)   is finite, the measure   μ   μ   \mu   is said to be of bounded variation . One can prove that if   μ   μ   \mu   is a vector measure of bounded variation, then   μ   μ   \mu   is countably additive if and only if    |  μ  |      μ    |\mu|   is countably additive.  Lyapunov's theorem  In the theory of vector measures, Lyapunov 's theorem states that the range of a ( non-atomic ) vector measure is closed and convex . 1 2 3 In fact, the range of a non-atomic vector measure is a zonoid (the closed and convex set that is the limit of a convergent sequence of zonotopes ). 4 It is used in economics , 5 This paper builds on two papers by Aumann:    Vind's article was noted by  with this comment:   The concept of a convex set (i.e., a set containing the segment connecting any two of its points) had repeatedly been placed at the center of economic theory before 1964. It appeared in a new light with the introduction of integration theory in the study of economic competition: If one associates with every agent of an economy an arbitrary set in the commodity space and if one averages those individual sets over a collection of insignificant agents, then the resulting set is necessarily convex . [Debreu appends this footnote: "On this direct consequence of a theorem of A. A. Lyapunov, see ."] But explanations of the ... functions of prices ... can be made to rest on the convexity of sets derived by that averaging process . Convexity in the commodity space obtained by aggregation over a collection of insignificant agents is an insight that economic theory owes ... to integration theory.
