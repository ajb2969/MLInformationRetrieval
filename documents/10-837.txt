   Tabersonine 16-O-methyltransferase      Tabersonine 16-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a tabersonine 16-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 16-hydroxytabersonine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 16-methoxytabersonine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 16-hydroxytabersonine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 16-methoxytabersonine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16-hydroxytabersonine 16-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include 11-demethyl-17-deacetylvindoline 11-methyltransferase , 11-O-demethyl-17-O-deacetylvindoline O-methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:11-O-demethyl-17-O-deacetylvindoline , and 11-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in terpene indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis.  References      "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
