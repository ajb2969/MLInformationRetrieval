Attenuation length

In physics, the attenuation length or absorption length is the distance

 
  into a material when the probability has dropped to 
 
 
 
  that a particle has not been absorbed. Alternatively, if there is a beam of particles incident on the material, the attenuation length is the distance where the intensity of the beam has dropped to 
 
 
 
 , or about 63% of the particles have been stopped.
Mathematically, the probability of finding a particle at depth x into the material is calculated by Beer-Lambert law:


 
 .
In general 
 
 
 
  is material and energy dependent.
