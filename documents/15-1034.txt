Carotenoid isomerooxygenase

Carotenoid isomerooxygenase (, ninaB (gene)) is an enzyme with system name zeaxanthin:oxygen 15,15'-oxidoreductase (bond-cleaving, cis-isomerizing).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

zeaxanthin + O2

 
  (3R)-11-cis-3-hydroxyretinal + (3R)-all-trans-3-hydroxyretinal
 

The enzyme from the moth Galleria mellonella and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster takes part in the synthesis of retinal .
