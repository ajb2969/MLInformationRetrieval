   Iota and Jot      Iota and Jot   Iota and its successor Jot (from Greek  iota , Hebrew  yodh , the smallest letters in those two alphabets) are extremely minimalist formal systems , designed to be even simpler than other more popular alternatives, such as the lambda calculus and SKI combinator calculus . They can therefore also be considered minimalist computer programming languages, or Turing tarpits , esoteric programming languages that are designed to be as small as possible but still Turing-complete . Both systems use only two symbols and involve only two operations. Zot is a continuized version of Iota that includes input and output.  Iota's universal combinator has a very simple structure (defined here using denotational semantics in terms of the lambda calculus ):   From this, one can recover the usual SKI basis combinators as follows:   Because of its minimalism, it has influenced research concerning Chaitin's constant . 1  See also   Lambda calculus  Combinatory logic  Binary combinatory logic  SKI combinator calculus   References  External links   Barker, Chris " Iota and Jot: the simplest languages?
