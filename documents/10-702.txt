   3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase (NADH)      3-oxoacyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase (NADH)   In enzymology , a 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ], NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 3-oxoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] (reduced nicotinamide adenine , dinucleotide) reductase , and 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADH) .
