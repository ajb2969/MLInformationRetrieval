   Neighborly polytope      Neighborly polytope   In geometry and polyhedral combinatorics , a k - neighborly polytope is a convex polytope in which every set of k or fewer vertices forms a face. For instance, a 2-neighborly polytope is a polytope in which every pair of vertices is connected by an edge , forming a complete graph . 2-neighborly polytopes with more than four vertices may exist only in spaces of four or more dimensions, and in general a k -neighborly polytope requires a dimension of 2 k or more. A d -simplex is d -neighborly. A polytope is said to be neighborly, without specifying k , if it is k -neighborly for    k  =   ⌊   d  /  2   ⌋       k      d  2      k=\lfloor d/2\rfloor   . If we exclude simplices, this is the maximum possible k : in fact, every polytope that is k -neighborly for some     k  ≥   1  +   ⌊   d  /  2   ⌋        k    1      d  2       k\geq 1+\lfloor d/2\rfloor    is a simplex. 1  In a k -neighborly polytope with k ≥ 3, every 2-face must be a triangle, and in a k -neighborly polytope with k ≥ 4, every 3-face must be a tetrahedron. More generally, in any k -neighborly polytope, all faces of dimension less than k are simplices .  The cyclic polytopes formed as the convex hulls of finite sets of points on the moment curve ( t , t 2 , ..., t d ) in d -dimensional space are automatically neighborly. Theodore Motzkin conjectured that all neighborly polytopes are combinatorially equivalent to cyclic polytopes. 2 However, contrary to this conjecture, there are many neighborly polytopes that are not cyclic: the number of combinatorially distinct neighborly polytopes grows superexponentially, both in the number of vertices of the polytope and in the dimension. 3  The convex hull of a set of random points, drawn from a Gaussian distribution with the number of points proportional to the dimension, is with high probability k -neighborly for a value k that is also proportional to the dimension. 4  The number of faces of all dimensions of a neighborly polytope in an even number of dimensions is determined solely from its dimension and its number of vertices by the Dehn–Sommerville equations : the number of k -dimensional faces, f k , satisfies the inequality       f   k  -  1    ≤   ∑   i  =  0    d  /  2      (   (      d  -  i        k  -  i      )   +   (     i        k  -  d   +  i      )   )     *    (       n  -  d  -  1   +  i       i     )   ,     fragments   subscript  f    k  1      superscript   subscript     i  0      d  2     superscript   fragments  normal-(   binomial    d  i     k  i      binomial  i      k  d   i    normal-)      binomial      n  d  1   i   i   normal-,    f_{k-1}\leq\sum_{i=0}^{d/2}{}^{*}\left({\left({{d-i}\atop{k-i}}\right)}+{\left%
 ({{i}\atop{k-d+i}}\right)}\right){\left({{n-d-1+i}\atop{i}}\right)},     where the asterisk means that the sums ends at    i  =   ⌊   d  /  2   ⌋       i      d  2      i=\lfloor d/2\rfloor   and final term of the sum should be halved if d is even. 5 According to the upper bound theorem of , 6 neighborly polytopes achieve the maximum possible number of faces of any n -vertex d -dimensional convex polytope.  A generalized version of the happy ending problem applies to higher-dimensional point sets, and imples that for every dimension d and every n > d there exists a number m ( d , n ) with the property that every m points in general position in d -dimensional space contain a subset of n points that form the vertices of a neighborly polytope. 7  References  "  Category:Polyhedral combinatorics     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  .
