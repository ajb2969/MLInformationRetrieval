In physics, Coulomb's law is an inverse-square law indicating the magnitude and direction of electrostatic force that one stationary, electrically charged object of small dimensions exerts on another. It is named after Charles-Augustin de Coulomb who used a torsion balance to establish it.
The magnitude of the electrostatic force between two point charges is directly proportional to the magnitudes of each charge and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the charges.
For calculating the direction and magnitude of the force simultaneously, one will wish to consult the full vectorÂ version of the Law





where 
 
 
 
  is the electrostatic force vector,

  is a constant called the permittivity of free space.
 



This vector equation indicates that opposite charges attract, and like charges repel. When 
 
 
 
  is negative, the force is attractive. When positive, the force is repulsive."
