Sedoheptulokinase

In enzymology, a sedoheptulokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + sedoheptulose 
 
 
 
  ADP + sedoheptulose 7-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and sedoheptulose, whereas its two products are ADP and sedoheptulose 7-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:sedoheptulose 7-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include heptulokinase, and sedoheptulokinase (phosphorylating). This enzyme participates in carbon fixation.
