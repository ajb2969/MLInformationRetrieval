   Giambelli's formula      Giambelli's formula   In mathematics, Giambelli's formula , named after Giovanni Giambelli , expresses Schubert classes in terms of special Schubert classes, or Schur functions in terms of complete symmetric functions .  It states       σ  λ   =   det    (   σ     λ  i   +  j   -  i    )     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  r           subscript  σ  λ      subscript   subscript  σ       subscript  λ  i   j   i     formulae-sequence    1  i     j  r        \displaystyle\sigma_{\lambda}=\det(\sigma_{\lambda_{i}+j-i})_{1\leq i,j\leq r}   where σ λ is the Schubert class of a partition λ.  Giambelli's formula is a consequence of Pieri's formula . The Porteous formula is a generalization to morphisms of vector bundles over a variety.  References      "  Category:Symmetric functions
