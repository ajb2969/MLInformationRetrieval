Giambelli's formula

In mathematics, Giambelli's formula, named after Giovanni Giambelli, expresses Schubert classes in terms of special Schubert classes, or Schur functions in terms of complete symmetric functions.
It states


 
  where σλ is the Schubert class of a partition λ.
Giambelli's formula is a consequence of Pieri's formula. The Porteous formula is a generalization to morphisms of vector bundles over a variety.
