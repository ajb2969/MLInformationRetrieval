   Sumset      Sumset   In additive combinatorics , the sumset (also called the Minkowski sum ) of two subsets A and B of an abelian group  G (written additively) is defined to be the set of all sums of an element from A with an element from B . That is,        A  +  B   =   {   a  +  b   :    a  ∈  A   ,   b  ∈  B    }    .        A  B    conditional-set    a  b    formulae-sequence    a  A     b  B       A+B=\{a+b:a\in A,b\in B\}.     The n -fold iterated sumset of A is        n  A   =   A  +  ⋯  +  A    ,        n  A     A  normal-⋯  A     nA=A+\cdots+A,     where there are n summands.  Many of the questions and results of additive combinatorics and additive number theory can be phrased in terms of sumsets. For example, Lagrange's four-square theorem can be written succinctly in the form        4  □   =  ℕ   ,        4  normal-□   ℕ    4\Box=\mathbb{N},     where   □   normal-□   \Box   is the set of square numbers . A subject that has received a fair amount of study is that of sets with small doubling , where the size of the set A + A is small (compared to the size of A ); see for example Freiman's theorem .
