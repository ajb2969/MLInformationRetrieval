   IC 4651      IC 4651   IC 4651 is an open cluster of stars located about 2,900 light years distant in the constellation  Ara . It was first catalogued by John Louis Emil Dreyer in his 1895 version of the Index Catalogue . 1 This is an intermediate age cluster that is  billion years old. 2 Compared to the Sun, the members of this cluster have a higher abundance of the chemical elements other than hydrogen and helium . 3 The combined mass of the active stars in this cluster is about 630 times the mass of the Sun . 4  The currently known active stars in this cluster form only about 7% of the cluster's original mass. Of the remainder, about 35% of the mass consists of stars that have evolved into white dwarfs or other stellar remnants . The remainder of lost mass consists of stars that have migrated away from the main body of the cluster or have been lost completely. 5  References  "  Category:Open clusters  4651
