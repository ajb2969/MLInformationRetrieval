   Functional encryption      Functional encryption   Functional encryption is a type of public-key encryption in which possessing a secret key allows one to learn a function of what the ciphertext is encrypting.  More precisely, a functional encryption scheme for a given functionality   F   F   F   consists of the following four algorithms:        (   p  k   ,   m  s  k   )   ←   S  e  t  u  p   (   1  λ   )       normal-←     p  k     m  s  k      S  e  t  u  p   superscript  1  λ      (pk,msk)\leftarrow Setup(1^{\lambda})   : creates a public key    p  k      p  k    pk   and a master secret key    m  s  k      m  s  k    msk   .       s  k   ←   K  e  y  g  e  n   (   m  s  k   ,  k  )       normal-←    s  k     K  e  y  g  e  n     m  s  k   k      sk\leftarrow Keygen(msk,k)   : uses the master secret key to generate a new secret key    s  k      s  k    sk   for value   k   k   k   .      c  ←   E  n  c   (   p  k   ,  x  )       normal-←  c    E  n  c     p  k   x      c\leftarrow Enc(pk,x)   : uses the public key to encrypt a message   x   x   x   .       F   (  k  ,  x  )    ←   D  e  c   (   s  k   ,  c  )       normal-←    F   k  x      D  e  c     s  k   c      F(k,x)\leftarrow Dec(sk,c)   : uses secret key to calculate a function of the value   c   c   c   encrypts.   Functional encryption generalizes several existing primitives including Identity-based encryption (IBE) and Attribute-based encryption (ABE). In the IBE case, define    F   (  k  ,  x  )       F   k  x     F(k,x)   to be equal to   x   x   x   when   k   k   k   corresponds to an identity that is allowed to decrypt, and   ⟂   perpendicular-to   \perp   otherwise. Similarly, in the ABE case, define     F   (  k  ,  x  )    =  x        F   k  x    x    F(k,x)=x   when   k   k   k   encodes attributes with permission to decrypt and   ⟂   perpendicular-to   \perp   otherwise.  Background  Functional encryption was proposed by Amit Sahai and Brent Waters in 2005 1 and formalized by Dan Boneh , Amit Sahai and Brent Waters in 2010. 2 Until recently, however, most instantiations of Functional Encryption supported only limited function classes such as boolean formulae. In 2012, several researchers developed Functional Encryption schemes that support arbitrary functions. 3 4 5  6  References  "  Category:Cryptography     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
