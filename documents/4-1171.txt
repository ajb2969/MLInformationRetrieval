   Dunkl operator      Dunkl operator   In mathematics , particularly the study of Lie groups , a Dunkl operator is a certain kind of mathematical operator , involving differential operators but also reflections in an underlying space.  Formally, let G be a Coxeter group with reduced root system R and k v a multiplicity function on R (so k u = k v whenever the reflections σ u and σ v corresponding to the roots u and v are conjugate in G ). Then, the Dunkl operator is defined by:        T  i   f   (  x  )    =     ∂   ∂   x  i     f   (  x  )    +    ∑   v  ∈   R  +       k  v      f   (  x  )    -   f   (   x   σ  v    )      ⟨  x  ,  v  ⟩     v  i             subscript  T  i   f  x             subscript  x  i     f  x     subscript     v   subscript  R         subscript  k  v         f  x     f    x   subscript  σ  v       x  v     subscript  v  i        T_{i}f(x)=\frac{\partial}{\partial x_{i}}f(x)+\sum_{v\in R_{+}}k_{v}\frac{f(x)%
 -f(x\sigma_{v})}{\left\langle x,v\right\rangle}v_{i}     where    v  i     subscript  v  i    v_{i}   is the i -th component of v , 1 ≤ i ≤ N , x in R N , and f a smooth function on R N .  Dunkl operators were introduced by . One of Dunkl's major results was that Dunkl operators "commute," that is, they satisfy      T  i    (    T  j   f   (  x  )    )    =    T  j    (    T  i   f   (  x  )    )           subscript  T  i      subscript  T  j   f  x       subscript  T  j      subscript  T  i   f  x      T_{i}(T_{j}f(x))=T_{j}(T_{i}f(x))   just as partial derivatives do. Thus Dunkl operators represent a meaningful generalization of partial derivatives.  References     "  Category:Lie groups
