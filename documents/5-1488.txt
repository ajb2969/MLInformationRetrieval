Weak topology (polar topology)

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics the weak topology is the coarsest polar topology, the topology with the fewest open sets, on a dual pair. The finest polar topology is called strong topology.
Under the weak topology the bounded sets coincide with the relatively compact sets which leads to the important Bourbakiâ€“Alaoglu theorem.
Definition
Given a dual pair

 
  the weak topology

 
  is the weakest polar topology on 
 
 
 
  so that


 
 . That is the continuous dual of 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
up to isomorphism.
The weak topology is constructed as follows:
For every 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  we define a semi norm on 
 
 



 
  with


 
  This family of semi norms defines a locally convex topology on 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

Given a normed vector space

 
  and its continuous dual

 
 , 
 
 
 
  is called the weak topology on 
 
 
 
  and
