   Hamamelose kinase      Hamamelose kinase   In enzymology , a hamamelose kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + D-hamamelose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + D-hamamelose 2'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-hamamelose , whereas its two products are ADP and D-hamamelose 2'-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-hamamelose 2'-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include hamamelose kinase (phosphorylating) , hamamelosekinase (ATP: hamamelose 2'-phosphotransferase) , and ATP/hamamelose 2'-phosphotransferase .
