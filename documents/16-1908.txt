Etherington's reciprocity theorem

The Etherington's distance-duality equation is the relationship between the luminosity distance of standard candles and the angular diameter distance.1 The equation is as follows
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the luminosity distance and 
 
 
 
  the angular-diameter distance.
History and derivations
When Etherington introduced this equation in 1933, he mentioned that this equation was proposed by Tolman as a way to test a cosmological model. Ellis proposed a proof of this equation in the context of Riemannian geometry.23 A quote from Ellis: "The core of the reciprocity theorem is the fact that many geometric properties are invariant when the roles of the source and observer in astronomical observations are transposed". This statement is fundamental in the derivation of the reciprocity theorem. The Etherington's reciprocity theorem was derived recently for a static universe; although this is more a pedagogical exercise.4
Validation from astronomical observations
The Etherington's distance-duality equation has been validated from astronomical observations based on the X-ray surface brightness and the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect of galaxy clusters.56 The reciprocity theorem is considered to be true when photon number is conserved, gravity is described by a metric theory with photons traveling on unique null geodesics.7 Any violation of the distance duality would be attributed to exotic physics.
