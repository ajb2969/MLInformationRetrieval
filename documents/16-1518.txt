Atiyah–Bott formula

In algebraic geometry, the Atiyah–Bott formula says1 the cohomology ring
$$\operatorname{H}^*(\operatorname{Bun}_G(X), \mathbb{Q}_l)$$ of the moduli stack of principal bundles is a free graded-commutative algebra on certain homogeneous generators. Atiyah and Bott's original work concerned integral cohomology ring of BunG(X).
