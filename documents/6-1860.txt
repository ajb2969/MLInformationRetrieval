   Sample exclusion dimension      Sample exclusion dimension   In computational learning theory , sample exclusion dimensions arise in the study of exact concept learning with queries. 1  In algorithmic learning theory , a concept over a domain X is a Boolean function over X . Here we only consider finite domains. A partial approximation  S of a concept c is a Boolean function over    Y  ⊆  X      Y  X    Y\subseteq X   such that c is an extension to S .  Let C be a class of concepts and c be a concept (not necessarily in C ). Then a specifying set for c w.r.t. C , denoted by S is a partial approximation S of c such that C contains at most one extension to S . If we have observed a specifying set for some concept w.r.t. C , then we have enough information to verify a concept in C with at most one more mind change.  The exclusion dimension , denoted by XD ( C ), of a concept class is the maximum of the size of the minimum specifying set of c ' with respect to C , where c ' is a concept not in C .
