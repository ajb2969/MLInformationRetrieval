   Filtered category      Filtered category   In category theory , filtered categories generalize the notion of directed set understood as a category (hence called a directed category; while some use directed category as a synonym for a filtered category). There is a dual notion of cofiltered category which will be recalled below.  Filtered categories  A category    J   J   J   is filtered when   it is not empty,  for every two objects   j   j   j   and    j  ′     superscript  j  normal-′    j^{\prime}   in   J   J   J   there exists an object   k   k   k   and two arrows    f  :   j  →  k      normal-:  f   normal-→  j  k     f:j\to k   and     f  ′   :    j  ′   →  k      normal-:   superscript  f  normal-′    normal-→   superscript  j  normal-′   k     f^{\prime}:j^{\prime}\to k   in   J   J   J   ,  for every two parallel arrows     u  ,  v   :   i  →  j      normal-:   u  v    normal-→  i  j     u,v:i\to j   in   J   J   J   , there exists an object   k   k   k   and an arrow    w  :   j  →  k      normal-:  w   normal-→  j  k     w:j\to k   such that     w  u   =   w  v         w  u     w  v     wu=wv   .   A diagram is said to be of cardinality   κ   κ   \kappa   if the morphism set of its domain is of cardinality   κ   κ   \kappa   . A category   J   J   J   is filtered if and only if there is a cocone over any finite diagram    d  :   D  →  J      normal-:  d   normal-→  D  J     d:D\to J   ; more generally, for a regular cardinal   κ   κ   \kappa   , a category   J   J   J   is said to be   κ   κ   \kappa   -filtered if for every diagram   d   d   d   in   J   J   J   of cardinality smaller than   κ   κ   \kappa   there is a cocone over   d   d   d   .  A filtered colimit is a colimit of a functor     F  :   J  →  C      normal-:  F   normal-→  J  C     F:J\to C   where   J   J   J   is a filtered category. This readily generalizes to   κ   κ   \kappa   -filtered limits. An ind-object in a category   C   C   C   is a presheaf of sets     C   o  p    →   S  e  t      normal-→   superscript  C    o  p      S  e  t     C^{op}\to Set   which is a small filtered colimit of representable presheaves. Ind-objects in a category   C   C   C   form a full subcategory    I  n  d   (  C  )       I  n  d  C    Ind(C)   in the category of functors     C   o  p    →   S  e  t      normal-→   superscript  C    o  p      S  e  t     C^{op}\to Set   . The category     P  r  o   (  C  )    =   I  n  d    (   C   o  p    )    o  p           P  r  o  C     I  n  d   superscript   superscript  C    o  p      o  p       Pro(C)=Ind(C^{op})^{op}   of pro-objects in   C   C   C   is the opposite of the category of ind-objects in the opposite category    C   o  p      superscript  C    o  p     C^{op}   .  Cofiltered categories  A category   J   J   J   is cofiltered if the opposite category     J  op     superscript  J  op    J^{\mathrm{op}}   is filtered. In detail, a category is cofiltered when   it is not empty  for every two objects   j   j   j   and    j  ′     superscript  j  normal-′    j^{\prime}   in   J   J   J   there exists an object   k   k   k   and two arrows    f  :   k  →  j      normal-:  f   normal-→  k  j     f:k\to j   and     f  ′   :   k  →   j  ′       normal-:   superscript  f  normal-′    normal-→  k   superscript  j  normal-′      f^{\prime}:k\to j^{\prime}   in   J   J   J   ,  for every two parallel arrows     u  ,  v   :   j  →  i      normal-:   u  v    normal-→  j  i     u,v:j\to i   in   J   J   J   , there exists an object   k   k   k   and an arrow    w  :   k  →  j      normal-:  w   normal-→  k  j     w:k\to j   such that     u  w   =   v  w         u  w     v  w     uw=vw   .   A cofiltered limit is a limit of a functor     F  :   J  →  C      normal-:  F   normal-→  J  C     F:J\to C   where   J   J   J   is a cofiltered category.
