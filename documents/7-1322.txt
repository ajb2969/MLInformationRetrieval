Filtered category

In category theory, filtered categories generalize the notion of directed set understood as a category (hence called a directed category; while some use directed category as a synonym for a filtered category). There is a dual notion of cofiltered category which will be recalled below.
Filtered categories
A category

 
  is filtered when

it is not empty,
for every two objects 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
  there exists an object 
 
 
 
  and two arrows 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 ,
for every two parallel arrows 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , there exists an object 
 
 
 
  and an arrow 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .

A diagram is said to be of cardinality 
 
 
 
 
  if the morphism set of its domain is of cardinality 
 
 
 
 . A category 
 
 
 
  is filtered if and only if there is a cocone over any finite diagram 
 
 
 
 ; more generally, for a regular cardinal 
 
 
 
 , a category 
 
 
 
 
  is said to be 
 
 
 
 -filtered if for every diagram 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  of cardinality smaller than 
 
 
 
  there is a cocone over 
 
 
 
 
 .
A filtered colimit is a colimit of a functor

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a filtered category. This readily generalizes to 
 
 
 
 -filtered limits. An ind-object in a category 
 
 
 
  is a presheaf of sets 
 
 
 
 
  which is a small filtered colimit of representable presheaves. Ind-objects in a category 
 
 
 
  form a full subcategory 
 
 
 
  in the category of functors 
 
 
 
 . The category 
 
 
 
  of pro-objects in 
 
 
 
 
  is the opposite of the category of ind-objects in the opposite category 
 
 
 
 .
Cofiltered categories
A category 
 
 
 
  is cofiltered if the opposite category

 
  is filtered. In detail, a category is cofiltered when

it is not empty
for every two objects 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  there exists an object 
 
 
 
  and two arrows 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 ,
for every two parallel arrows 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , there exists an object 
 
 
 
  and an arrow 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 .

A cofiltered limit is a limit of a functor

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a cofiltered category.
