   Minimal coupling      Minimal coupling   In physics , minimal coupling refers to a coupling between fields which involves only the charge distribution and not higher multipole moments of the charge distribution. This minimal coupling is in contrast to, for example, Pauli coupling , which includes the magnetic moment of an electron directly in the Lagrangian .  In electrodynamics , minimal coupling is adequate to account for all electromagnetic interactions. Higher moments of particles are consequences of minimal coupling and non-zero spin .  Mathematically, minimal coupling is achieved by subtracting the charge (   q   q   q   ) times the four-potential (    A  μ     subscript  A  μ    A_{\mu}   ) from the four-momentum (    p  μ     subscript  p  μ    p_{\mu}   ) in the Lagrangian or Hamiltonian :       p  μ   ↦    p  μ   -    q    A  μ        maps-to   subscript  p  μ      subscript  p  μ     q   subscript  A  μ       p_{\mu}\mapsto p_{\mu}-q\ A_{\mu}      Taken almost verbatim from Doughty's Lagrangian Interaction, pg. 456     See the Hamiltonian mechanics article for a full derivation and examples.  Inflation  In studies of cosmological inflation , minimal coupling of a scalar field usually refers to minimal coupling to gravity. This means that the action for the field   φ   φ   \varphi   (called the inflaton in the context of inflation) is not coupled to the scalar curvature . Its only coupling to gravity is the coupling to the Lorentz invariant  measure        -  g      d  4   x          g     superscript  d  4   x    \sqrt{-g}\,d^{4}x   constructed from the metric (in Planck units ):      S  =   ∫    d  4    x     g     (     -    1  2   R    +    1  2     ∇  μ   φ     ∇  μ   φ     -   V   (  φ  )     )         S       superscript  d  4   x    g             1  2   R        1  2     subscript  normal-∇  μ   φ     superscript  normal-∇  μ   φ       V  φ        S=\int d^{4}x\,\sqrt{g}\,\left(-\frac{1}{2}R+\frac{1}{2}\nabla_{\mu}\varphi%
