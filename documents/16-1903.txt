Huggins equation

The Huggins Equation is an empirical equation used to relate the reduced viscosity of a dilute polymer solution to the concentration of the polymer in solution. The Huggins equation states:



Where 
 
 
 
  is the reduced viscosity of a polymer in solution, 
 
 
 
  is the intrinsic viscosity of the solution, 
 
 
 
  is the Huggins coefficient, and 
 
 
 
  is the concentration of the polymer in solution.1 In isolation, 
 
 
 
  is the relative viscosity increment for the solution.
The Huggins coefficient used in this equation is an indicator of the strength of a solvent. The coefficient typically ranges from about 
 
 
 
  (for strong solvents) to 
 
 
 
  (for poor solvents).2
