   Huggins equation      Huggins equation   The Huggins Equation is an empirical equation used to relate the reduced viscosity of a dilute polymer solution to the concentration of the polymer in solution. The Huggins equation states:       [    n  i   c   ]   =   [  n  ]   +   k  H     [  n  ]   2   c     fragments   fragments  normal-[     subscript  n  i   c   normal-]      fragments  normal-[  n  normal-]     subscript  k  H    superscript   fragments  normal-[  n  normal-]   2   c    \left[\frac{n_{i}}{c}\right]\quad=[n]+k_{H}[n]^{2}c     Where     n  i   c       subscript  n  i   c    \frac{n_{i}}{c}   is the reduced viscosity of a polymer in solution,   n   n   n   is the intrinsic viscosity of the solution,    k  H     subscript  k  H    k_{H}   is the Huggins coefficient, and   c   c   c   is the concentration of the polymer in solution. 1 In isolation,    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   is the relative viscosity increment for the solution.  The Huggins coefficient used in this equation is an indicator of the strength of a solvent. The coefficient typically ranges from about   0.3   0.3   0.3   (for strong solvents) to   0.5   0.5   0.5   (for poor solvents). 2  See also   Viscosity  Rheology   References  "  Category:Polymers  Category:Viscosity     ↩  ↩
