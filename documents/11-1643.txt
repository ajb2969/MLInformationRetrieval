   UTP-monosaccharide-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase      UTP-monosaccharide-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase   In enzymology , an UTP-monosaccharide-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UTP + a monosaccharide 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + UDP-monosaccharide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UTP and monosaccharide 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and UDP-monosaccharide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ' '. Other names in common use include UDP-sugar pyrophosphorylase , and PsUSP .
