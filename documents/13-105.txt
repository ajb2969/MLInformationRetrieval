   Tracy–Widom distribution      Tracy–Widom distribution   The Tracy–Widom distribution , introduced by , is the probability distribution of the normalized largest eigenvalue of a random Hermitian matrix . 1  In practical terms, Tracy-Widom is the crossover function between the two phases of weakly versus strongly coupled components in a system. 2 It also appears in the distribution of the length of the longest increasing subsequence of random permutations , in current fluctuations of the asymmetric simple exclusion process (ASEP) with step initial condition (, ), and in simplified mathematical models of the behavior of the longest common subsequence problem on random inputs . See (, ) for experimental testing (and verifying) that the interface fluctuations of a growing droplet (or substrate) are described by the TW distribution    F  2     subscript  F  2    F_{2}   (or    F  1     subscript  F  1    F_{1}   ) as predicted by ().  The distribution F 1 is of particular interest in multivariate statistics . For a discussion of the universality of F β , β = 1, 2, and 4, see . For an application of F 1 to inferring population structure from genetic data see .  Definition  The Tracy-Widom distribution is defined as the limit: 3       F  2    (  s  )   =   lim   n  →  ∞    Prob   (   (   λ  max   -    2  n    )    (   2   )    n   1  /  6    ≤  s  )      fragments   subscript  F  2    fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)     subscript    normal-→  n     Prob   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-(   subscript  λ  max        2  n    normal-)    fragments  normal-(    2   normal-)    superscript  n    1  6     s  normal-)     F_{2}(s)=\lim\limits_{n\rightarrow\infty}{\rm Prob}\left((\lambda_{\rm max}-%
 \sqrt{2n})(\sqrt{2})n^{1/6}\leq s\right)   ,  The shift by     2  n         2  n     \sqrt{2n}   is used to keep the distributions centered at 0. The multiplication by     (   2   )    n   1  /  6          2    superscript  n    1  6      (\sqrt{2})n^{1/6}   is used because the standard deviation of the distributions scales as    n   -   1  /  6       superscript  n      1  6      n^{-1/6}   .  Equivalent formulations  The cumulative distribution function of the Tracy–Widom distribution can be given as the Fredholm determinant        F  2    (  s  )    =   det   (   I  -   A  s    )           subscript  F  2   s       I   subscript  A  s       F_{2}(s)=\det(I-A_{s})\,     of the operator A s on square integrable functions on the half line ( s , ∞) with kernel given in terms of Airy functions Ai by         Ai   (  x  )    Ai  ′    (  y  )    -    Ai  ′    (  x  )   Ai   (  y  )      x  -  y    .          Ai  x   superscript  Ai  normal-′   y      superscript  Ai  normal-′   x  Ai  y      x  y     \frac{\mathrm{Ai}(x)\mathrm{Ai}^{\prime}(y)-\mathrm{Ai}^{\prime}(x)\mathrm{Ai}%
 (y)}{x-y}.\,     It can also be given as an integral        F  2    (  s  )    =   exp   (   -    ∫  s  ∞     (   x  -  s   )    q  2    (  x  )   d  x     )           subscript  F  2   s         superscript   subscript   s         x  s    superscript  q  2   x  d  x        F_{2}(s)=\exp\left(-\int_{s}^{\infty}(x-s)q^{2}(x)\,dx\right)     in terms of a solution of a Painlevé equation of type II        q  ′′    (  s  )    =    s  q   (  s  )    +   2  q     (  s  )   3             superscript  q  ′′   s       s  q  s     2  q   superscript  s  3       q^{\prime\prime}(s)=sq(s)+2q(s)^{3}\,   where q , called the Hastings–McLeod solution, satisfies the boundary condition         q   (  s  )    ∼   Ai   (  s  )     ,   s  →  ∞    .     formulae-sequence   similar-to    q  s     Ai  s     normal-→  s      \displaystyle q(s)\sim\textrm{Ai}(s),s\rightarrow\infty.     Other Tracy-Widom Distributions  The distribution F 2 is associated to unitary ensembles in random matrix theory. There are analogous Tracy–Widom distributions F 1 and F 4 for orthogonal ( β = 1) and symplectic ensembles ( β = 4) that are also expressible in terms of the same Painlevé transcendent  q :        F  1    (  s  )    =    exp   (   -    1  2     ∫  s  ∞    q   (  x  )   d  x      )      (    F  2    (  s  )    )    1  /  2            subscript  F  1   s             1  2     superscript   subscript   s       q  x  d  x        superscript     subscript  F  2   s     1  2       F_{1}(s)=\exp\left(-\frac{1}{2}\int_{s}^{\infty}q(x)\,dx\right)\,\left(F_{2}(s%
 )\right)^{1/2}   and         F  4    (   s  /   2    )    =    cosh   (    1  2     ∫  s  ∞    q   (  x  )   d  x     )      (    F  2    (  s  )    )    1  /  2      .         subscript  F  4     s    2             1  2     superscript   subscript   s       q  x  d  x       superscript     subscript  F  2   s     1  2       F_{4}(s/\sqrt{2})=\cosh\left(\frac{1}{2}\int_{s}^{\infty}q(x)\,dx\right)\,%

Numerical approximations  Numerical techniques for obtaining numerical solutions to the Painlevé equations of the types II and V, and numerically evaluating eigenvalue distributions of random matrices in the beta-ensembles were first presented by  using MATLAB . These approximation techniques were further analytically justified in  and used to provide numerical evaluation of Painlevé II and Tracy–Widom distributions (for β=1,2, and 4) in S-PLUS . These distributions have been tabulated in  to four significant digits for values of the argument in increments of 0.01; a statistical table for p-values was also given in this work.  gave accurate and fast algorithms for the numerical evaluation of F β and the density functions f β ( s ) = dF β / ds for β = 1, 2, and 4. These algorithms can be used to compute numerically the mean , variance , skewness and kurtosis of the distributions F β .      β   Mean   Variance   Skewness   Kurtosis       1   −1.2065335745820   1.607781034581   0.29346452408   0.1652429384     2   −1.771086807411   0.8131947928329   0.224084203610   0.0934480876     4   −2.306884893241   0.5177237207726   0.16550949435   0.0491951565     Functions for working with the Tracy–Widom laws are also presented in the R package 'RMTstat' by  and MATLAB package 'RMLab' by .
