Ramanujan–Sato series

In mathematics, a Ramanujan–Sato series12 generalizes Ramanujan’s pi formulas such as,



to the form,



by using other well-defined sequences of integers

 
  obeying a certain recurrence relation, sequences which may be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients

 
 , and employing modular forms of higher levels.
Ramanujan made the enigmatic remark that there were "corresponding theories", but it was only recently that H.H. Chan and S. Cooper found a general approach that used the underlying modular congruence subgroup 
 
 
 
 ,3 while G. Almkvist has experimentally found numerous other examples also with a general method using differential operators.4
Levels 1–4A were given by Ramanujan (1917),5 level 5 by H.H. Chan and S. Cooper (2012),6 6A by Chan, Tanigawa, Yang, and Zudilin,7 6B by Sato (2002),8 6C by H. Chan, S. Chan, and Z. Liu (2004),9 6D by H. Chan and H. Verrill (2009),10 level 7 by S. Cooper (2012),11 part of level 8 by Almkvist and Guillera (2012),12 part of level 10 by Y. Yang, and the rest by H.H. Chan and S.Cooper.
The notation jn(τ) is derived from Zagier13 and Tn refers to the relevant McKay–Thompson series.
Level 1
Examples for levels 1–4 were given by Ramanujan in his 1917 paper. Given 
 
 
 
  as in the rest of this article. Let,



with the j-function j(τ), Eisenstein series E4, and Dedekind eta function η(τ). The first expansion is the McKay–Thompson series of class 1A () with a(0) = 744. Note that, as first noticed by J. McKay, the coefficient of the linear term of j(τ) is exceedingly close to 
 
 
 
  which is the smallest degree > 1 of the irreducible representations of the Monster group. Similar phenomenon will be observed in the other levels. Define,


 
  ()



Then the two modular functions and sequences are related by,



if the series converges and the sign chosen appropriately, though squaring both sides easily removes the ambiguity. Analogous relationships exist for the higher levels.
Examples:






and 
 
 
 
  is a fundamental unit. The first belongs to a family of formulas which were rigorously proven by the Chudnovsky brothers in 198914 and later used to calculate 10 trillion digits of π in 2011.15 The second formula, and the ones for higher levels, was established by H.H. Chan and S. Cooper in 2012.16
Level 2
Using Zagier’s notation17 for the modular function of level 2,



Note that the coefficient of the linear term of j2A(τ) is one more than 
 
 
 
  which is the smallest degree > 1 of the irreducible representations of the Baby Monster group. Define,


 
  ()



Then,



if the series converges and the sign chosen appropriately.
Examples:






The first formula, found by Ramanujan and mentioned at the start of the article, belongs to a family proven by D. Bailey and the Borwein brothers in a 1989 paper.18
Level 3
Define,



where 
 
 
 
  is the smallest degree > 1 of the irreducible representations of the Fischer group Fi23 and,


 
  ()



Examples:






Level 4
Define,



where the first is the 24th power of the Weber modular function

 
 . And,


 
  ()


 
  ()
Examples:






Level 5
Define,



and,





 
  ()
where the first is the product of the central binomial coefficients and the Apéry numbers ()19
Examples:






Level 6
Modular functions
In 2002, Sato20 established the first results for level > 4. Interestingly, it involved Apéry numbers which were first used to establish the irrationality of 
 
 
 
 . First, define,















J. Conway and S. Norton showed21 there are linear relations between the McKay–Thompson series Tn, one of which was,



or using the above eta quotients jn,



σ Sequences
For the modular function j6A, one can associate it with three different sequences. Define the number of 2n-step polygons on a cubic lattice, or the product of the central binomial coefficients

 
  and  as σ1(k),


 
  ()
the product of c(k) and (-1)^k  as σ2(k),



and the product of c(k) and Franel numbers as σ3(k),


 
  ()
Each has a companion sequence. Respectively, these are the Apéry numbers,


 
  ()
the Domb numbers (unsigned), or the number of 2n-step polygons on a diamond lattice,


 
  ()
and the Almkvist-Zudilin numbers,


 
  ()
Identities
The modular functions can be related as 
 
 
 
  where,



if the series converges and the sign chosen appropriately.
Examples
One can use a value for j6A in three ways. For example, starting with,



then,



For the other modular functions,









Level 7
Define


 
  ()
and,



Example:



No pi formula has yet been found using j7B.
Level 8
Define,



The expansion of the first is the McKay–Thompson series of class 4B (and is a square root of another function) while the second, if unsigned, is that of class 8A given by the third. Let,






where the first is the product22 of the central binomial coefficient and a sequence related to an arithmetic-geometric mean (),
Examples:









though no pi formula is yet known using j8A(τ).
Level 9
Define,



The expansion of the first is the McKay–Thompson series of class 3C (and related to the cube root of the j-function), while the second is that of class 9A. Let,






where the first is the product of the central binomial coefficients and  (though with different signs).
Examples:






Level 10
Modular functions
Define,















Just like the level 6, there are also linear relations between these,



or using the above eta quotients jn,



Sequences
Let,


 
  ()






their complements,






and,









though closed-forms are not yet known for the last three sequences.
Identities
The modular functions can be related as,23



if the series converges. It can also be observed that 
 
 
 
  where,






Since the exponent has a fractional part, the sign of the square root must be chosen appropriately though it is less an issue when jn is positive.
Examples
Starting with,



then,



though the ones using the complements do not yet have a rigorous proof. A conjectured formula using one of the last three sequences is,



which implies there might be examples for all sequences of level 10.
Level 11
Define the McKay–Thompson series of class 11A,



where,



and,



No closed-form in terms of binomial coefficients is yet known for the sequence but it obeys the recurrence relation,



with initial conditions s(0) = 1, s(1) = 4.
Example:24



Higher levels
As pointed out by Cooper,25 there are analogous sequences for certain higher levels.
