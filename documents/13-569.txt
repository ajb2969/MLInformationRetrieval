Markov switching multifractal

In financial econometrics, the Markov-switching multifractal (MSM) is a model of asset returns that incorporates stochastic volatility components of heterogeneous durations.12 MSM captures the outliers, log-memory-like volatility persistence and power variation of financial returns. In currency and equity series, MSM compares favorably with standard volatility models such as GARCH(1,1) and FIGARCH both in- and out-of-sample. MSM is used by practitioners in the financial industry to forecast volatility, compute value-at-risk, and price derivatives.
MSM specification
The MSM model can be specified in both discrete time and continuous time.
Discrete time
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the price of a financial asset, and let 
 
 
 
  denote the return over two consecutive periods. In MSM, returns are specified as



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are constants and {
 
 
 
 } are independent standard Gaussians. Volatility is driven by the first-order latent Markov state vector:



Given the volatility state 
 
 
 
 , the next-period multiplier 
 
 
 
  is drawn from a fixed distribution 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
 , and is otherwise left unchanged.










The transition probabilities are specified by


 
 .
The sequence 
 
 
 
  is approximately geometric 
 
 
 
  at low frequency. The marginal distribution 
 
 
 
  has a unit mean, has a positive support, and is independent of 
 
 
 
 .
Binomial MSM
In empirical applications, the distribution 
 
 
 
  is often a discrete distribution that can take the values 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  with equal probability. The return process 
 
 
 
  is then specified by the parameters 
 
 
 
 . Note that the number of parameters is the same for all 
 
 
 
 .
Continuous time
MSM is similarly defined in continuous time. The price process follows the diffusion:



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a standard Brownian motion, and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are constants. Each component follows the dynamics:










The intensities vary geometrically with 
 
 
 
 :



When the number of components 
 
 
 
  goes to infinity, continuous-time MSM converges to a multifractal diffusion, whose sample paths take a continuum of local Hölder exponents on any finite time interval.
Inference and closed-form likelihood
When 
 
 
 
  has a discrete distribution, the Markov state vector 
 
 
 
  takes finitely many values 
 
 
 
 . For instance, there are 
 
 
 
  possible states in binomial MSM. The Markov dynamics are characterized by the transition matrix 
 
 
 
  with components 
 
 
 
 . Conditional on the volatility state, the return 
 
 
 
  has Gaussian density



Conditional distribution
We do not directly observe the latent state vector 
 
 
 
 . Given past returns, we can define the conditional probabilities:



The vector 
 
 
 
  is computed recursively:



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 , and



The initial vector 
 
 
 
  is set equal to the ergodic distribution of 
 
 
 
 . For binomial MSM, 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
Closed-form Likelihood
The log likelihood function has the following analytical expression:



Maximum likelihood provides reasonably precise estimates in finite samples.3
Other estimation methods
When 
 
 
 
  has a continuous distribution, estimation can proceed by simulated method of moments,45 or simulated likelihood via a particle filter.6
Forecasting
Given 
 
 
 
 , the conditional distribution of the latent state vector at date 
 
 
 
  is given by:



MSM often provides better volatility forecasts than some of the best traditional models both in and out of sample. Calvet and Fisher7 report considerable gains in exchange rate volatility forecasts at horizons of 10 to 50 days as compared with GARCH(1,1), Markov-Switching GARCH,89 and Fractionally Integrated GARCH.10 Lux11 obtains similar results using linear predictions.
Applications
Multiple assets and value-at-risk
Extensions of MSM to multiple assets provide reliable estimates of the value-at-risk in a portfolio of securities.12
Asset pricing
In financial economics, MSM has been used to analyze the pricing implications of multifrequency risk. The models have had some success in explaining the excess volatility of stock returns compared to fundamentals and the negative skewness of equity returns. They have also been used to generate multifractal jump-diffusions.13
Related approaches
MSM is a stochastic volatility model1415 with arbitrarily many frequencies. MSM builds on the convenience of regime-switching models, which were advanced in economics and finance by James D. Hamilton.1617 MSM is closely related to the Multifractal Model of Asset Returns.18 MSM improves on the MMAR’s combinatorial construction by randomizing arrival times, guaranteeing a strictly stationary process. MSM provides a pure regime-switching formulation of multifractal measures, which were pioneered by Benoit Mandelbrot.192021
