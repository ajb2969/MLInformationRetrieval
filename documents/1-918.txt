   Riesz representation theorem      Riesz representation theorem   There are several well-known theorems in functional analysis known as the Riesz representation theorem . They are named in honour of Frigyes Riesz .  This article will describe his theorem concerning the dual of a Hilbert space , which is sometimes called the Fréchet-Riesz theorem. For the theorems relating linear functionals to measures, see Riesz–Markov–Kakutani representation theorem .  The Hilbert space representation theorem  This theorem establishes an important connection between a Hilbert space and its (continuous) dual space . If the underlying field is the real numbers , the two are isometrically  isomorphic ; if the underlying field is the complex numbers , the two are isometrically anti-isomorphic . The (anti-) isomorphism is a particular, natural one as will be described next.  Let H be a Hilbert space, and let H* denote its dual space, consisting of all continuous linear functionals from H into the field R or C . If x is an element of H , then the function φ x , for all y in H defined by         φ  x    (  y  )    =   ⟨  y  ,  x  ⟩    ,         subscript  φ  x   y    y  x     \varphi_{x}(y)=\left\langle y,x\right\rangle,     where    ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle   denotes the inner product of the Hilbert space, is an element of H* . The Riesz representation theorem states that every element of H* can be written uniquely in this form.  Theorem . The mapping   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   : H → H* defined by   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   ( x ) =   φ   φ   \varphi    x is an isometric (anti-) isomorphism, meaning that:      Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is bijective .  The norms of x and   φ   φ   \varphi   ( x ) agree     ∥  x  ∥   =   ∥   Φ   (  x  )    ∥        norm  x    norm    normal-Φ  x      \|x\|=\|\Phi(x)\|   .     Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is additive     Φ   (    x  1   +   x  2    )    =    Φ   (   x  1   )    +   Φ   (   x  2   )           normal-Φ     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2         normal-Φ   subscript  x  1      normal-Φ   subscript  x  2       \Phi(x_{1}+x_{2})=\Phi(x_{1})+\Phi(x_{2})   .  If the base field is R , then     Φ   (   λ  x   )    =   λ  Φ   (  x  )          normal-Φ    λ  x      λ  normal-Φ  x     \Phi(\lambda x)=\lambda\Phi(x)   for all real numbers λ.  If the base field is C , then     Φ   (   λ  x   )    =    λ  ¯   Φ   (  x  )          normal-Φ    λ  x       normal-¯  λ   normal-Φ  x     \Phi(\lambda x)=\bar{\lambda}\Phi(x)   for all complex numbers λ, where    λ  ¯     normal-¯  λ    \bar{\lambda}   denotes the complex conjugation of λ.   The inverse map of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   can be described as follows. Given a non-zero element   φ   φ   \varphi   of H* , the orthogonal complement of the kernel of   φ   φ   \varphi   is a one-dimensional subspace of H . Take a non-zero element z in that subspace, and set    x  =      φ   (  z  )    ¯   ⋅  z   /    ∥  z  ∥   2        x     normal-⋅   normal-¯    φ  z    z    superscript   norm  z   2      x=\overline{\varphi(z)}\cdot z/{\left\|z\right\|}^{2}   . Then   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   ( x ) =   φ   φ   \varphi   .  Historically, the theorem is often attributed simultaneously to Riesz and Fréchet in 1907 (see references).  In the mathematical treatment of quantum mechanics , the theorem can be seen as a justification for the popular bra–ket notation . When the theorem holds, every ket    |  ψ  ⟩     ket  ψ    |\psi\rangle   has a corresponding bra    ⟨  ψ  |     bra  ψ    \langle\psi|   , and the correspondence is unambiguous. cf. also Rigged Hilbert space  References   M.
