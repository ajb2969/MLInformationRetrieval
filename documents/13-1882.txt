Cornacchia's algorithm

In computational number theory, Cornacchia's algorithm is an algorithm for solving the Diophantine equation

The algorithm
First, find any solution to 
 
 
 
  (perhaps by using an algorithm listed here); if no such 
 
 
 
  exist, there can be no primitive solution to the original equation. Without loss of generality, we can assume that  (if not, then replace  with , which will still be a root of 
 
 
 
 ). Then use the Euclidean algorithm to find 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and so on; stop when 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is an integer, then the solution is 
 
 
 
 ; otherwise there is no primitive solution.
To find non-primitive solutions 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , note that the existence of such a solution implies that  divides 
 
 
 
  (and equivalently, that if 
 
 
 
  is square-free, then all solutions are primitive). Thus the above algorithm can be used to search for a primitive solution 
 
 
 
  to  }}. If such a solution is found, then 
 
 
 
  will be a solution to the original equation.
Example
Solve the equation 
 
 
 
 . A square root of −6 (mod 103) is 32, and 103 ≡ 7 (mod 32); since 
 
 
 
  and $\sqrt{\tfrac{103-7^2}6}=3$, there is a solution x = 7, y = 3.
