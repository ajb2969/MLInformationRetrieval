   Chip (CDMA)      Chip (CDMA)   In digital communications , a chip is a pulse of a direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) code, such as a Pseudo-random Noise (PN) code sequence used in direct-sequence code division multiple access (CDMA) channel access techniques.  In a binary direct-sequence system, each chip is typically a rectangular pulse of +1 or –1 amplitude, which is multiplied by a data sequence (similarly +1 or –1 representing the message bits) and by a carrier waveform to make the transmitted signal. The chips are therefore just the bit sequence out of the code generator; they are called chips to avoid confusing them with message bits. 1  The chip rate of a code is the number of pulses per second (chips per second) at which the code is transmitted (or received). The chip rate is larger than the symbol rate , meaning that one symbol is represented by multiple chips. The ratio is known as the spreading factor (SF) or processing gain:       SF   =   chip rate  symbol rate       SF    chip rate  symbol rate     \ \mbox{SF}=\frac{\mbox{chip rate}}{\mbox{symbol rate}}     Orthogonal variable spreading factor   Orthogonal variable spreading factor ( OVSF ) is an implementation of Code division multiple access (CDMA) where before each signal is transmitted, the signal is spread over a wide spectrum range through the use of a user's code. Users' codes are carefully chosen to be mutually orthogonal to each other.  These codes are derived from an OVSF code tree, and each user is given a different Code–, unique code. An OVSF code tree is a complete binary tree that reflects the construction of Hadamard matrices .  References  External links   CDMA basics   "     ↩
