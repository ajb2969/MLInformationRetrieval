Toda–Smith complex

In mathematics, Toda–Smith complexes are spectra characterized by having a particularly simple homology, and are used in stable homotopy theory.
Toda–Smith complexes provided examples of periodic maps. Thus, they led to the construction of the nilpotent and periodicity theorems,1 which provided the first organization of the stable homotopy groups of spheres into families of maps localized at a prime.
Mathematical context
The story begins with the degree 
 
 
 
  map on 
 
 
 
  (as a circle in the complex plane):






The degree 
 
 
 
  map is well defined for 
 
 
 
  in general, where 
 
 
 
 . If we apply the infinite suspension functor to this map, 
 
 
 
  and we take the cofiber of the resulting map:



We find that 
 
 
 
  has the remarkable property of coming from a Moore space (i.e., a designer (co)homology space
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is trivial for all 
 
 
 
 ).
It is also of note that the periodic maps, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , come from degree maps between the Toda–Smith complexes, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  respectively.
Formal definition
The 
 
 
 
 th Toda–Smith complex, 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 , is a finite spectrum which satisfies the property that its BP-homology, 
 
 
 
 , is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .
That is, Toda–Smith complexes are completely characterized by their 
 
 
 
 -local properties, and are defined as any object 
 
 
 
  satisfying one of the following equations:



It may help the reader to recall that that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  = 
 
 
 
 .
