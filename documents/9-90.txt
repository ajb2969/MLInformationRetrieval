Fast marching method

The fast marching method is a numerical method for solving boundary value problems of the Eikonal equation:



Typically, such a problem describes the evolution of a closed curve as a function of time 
 
 
 
  with speed 
 
 
 
  in the normal direction at a point 
 
 
 
  on the curve. The speed function is specified, and the time at which the contour crosses a point 
 
 
 
  is obtained by solving the equation.
The algorithm is similar to Dijkstra's algorithm and uses the fact that information only flows outward from the seeding area.
This problem is a special case of level set methods. More general algorithms exist but are normally slower.
