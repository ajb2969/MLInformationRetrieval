   Beta-glucan-transporting ATPase      Beta-glucan-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , a beta-glucan-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + beta-glucan in    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + beta-glucan out    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and beta-glucan , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and beta-glucan .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (beta-glucan-exporting) .  References        "  Category:EC 3.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
