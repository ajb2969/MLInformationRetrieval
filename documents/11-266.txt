Beta-glucan-transporting ATPase




Beta-glucan-transporting ATPase

In enzymology, a beta-glucan-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + H2O + beta-glucanin

 
  ADP + phosphate + beta-glucanout


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, H2O, and beta-glucan, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and beta-glucan.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (beta-glucan-exporting).
