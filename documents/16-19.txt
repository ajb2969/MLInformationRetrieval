Exo-(1-4)-α-D-glucan lyase

Exo-(1->4)-alpha-D-glucan lyase (, alpha-(1->4)-glucan 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose eliminase, alpha-1,4-glucan exo-lyase, alpha-1,4-glucan lyase, GLase) is an enzyme with system name (1->4)-alpha-D-glucan exo-4-lyase (1,5-anhydro-D-fructose-forming).1234567 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

linear alpha-glucan 
 
 
 
  (n-1) 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose + D-glucose


The enzyme catalyses the sequential degradation of (1->4)-alpha-D-glucans from the non-reducing end.
