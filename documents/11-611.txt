   Beta-primeverosidase      Beta-primeverosidase   In enzymology , a beta-primeverosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a 6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranose + an alcohol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranose and alcohol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-O-(beta-D-xylopyranosyl)-beta-D-glucopyranoside 6-O-(beta-D-xylosyl)-beta-D-glucohydrolase .
