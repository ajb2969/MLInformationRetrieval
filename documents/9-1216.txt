   Neutron supermirror      Neutron supermirror   A neutron supermirror is a highly polished surface used in connection with neutron beams .  Supermirrors are produced by depositing and polishing large numbers of layers of a reflecting substance, such as silicon , nickel , titanium or nickel/titanium composite, on a substrate. In this way, the critical angle of total reflection becomes    n  ⋅   θ  c      normal-⋅  n   subscript  θ  c     n\cdot\theta_{c}   , where   n   n   n   is the number of layers and    θ  c     subscript  θ  c    \theta_{c}   the angle of total reflection for a single layer.
