   Càdlàg      Càdlàg   In mathematics , a càdlàg (French "continue à droite, limite à gauche"), RCLL (“right continuous with left limits”), or corlol ("continuous on (the) right, limit on (the) left") function is a function defined on the real numbers (or a subset of them) that is everywhere right-continuous and has left limits everywhere. Càdlàg functions are important in the study of stochastic processes that admit (or even require) jumps, unlike Brownian motion , which has continuous sample paths. The collection of càdlàg functions on a given domain is known as Skorokhod space .  Two related terms are càglàd , standing for "continue à gauche, limite à droite", the left-right reversal of càdlàg, and càllàl for "continue à l'un, limite à l’autre" (continuous on one side, limit on the other side), for a function which is interchangeably either càdlàg or càglàd at each point of the domain. A more mellifluous English term is ricowil or, more whimsically, ricowilli , both terms standing for "right continuous with left limits".  Definition  (Figure)  Cumulative distribution functions are examples of càdlàg functions.   Let  be a metric space , and let . A function  is called a càdlàg function if, for every ,   the left limit  lim s↑t  ƒ ( s )}} exists; and  the right limit  lim s↓t  ƒ ( s )}} exists and equals ƒ ( t ).   That is, ƒ is right-continuous with left limits.  Examples   All continuous functions are càdlàg functions.  As a consequence of their definition, all cumulative distribution functions are càdlàg functions. For instance the cumulative at point   r   r   r   correspond to the probability of being lower or equal than   r   r   r   , namely    ℙ   [  x  ≤  r  ]      fragments  P   fragments  normal-[  x   r  normal-]     \mathbb{P}[x\leq r]   . In other words, the semi-open interval of concern for a two-tailed distribution    (   -  ∞   ,  r  ]         r    (-\infty,r]   is right-closed.  The right derivative f + ' of any convex function '' f'' defined on an open interval, is an increasing cadlag function.   Skorokhod space  The set of all càdlàg functions from E to M is often denoted by  (or simply D ) and is called Skorokhod space after the Soviet  mathematician  Anatoliy Skorokhod . Skorokhod space can be assigned a topology that, intuitively allows us to "wiggle space and time a bit" (whereas the traditional topology of uniform convergence only allows us to "wiggle space a bit"). For simplicity, take  and  R n }} — see Billingsley for a more general construction.  We must first define an analogue of the modulus of continuity , . For any , set        w  f    (  F  )    :=    sup    s  ,  t   ∈  F     |    f   (  s  )    -   f   (  t  )     |       assign     subscript  w  f   F     subscript  supremum     s  t   F          f  s     f  t        w_{f}(F):=\sup_{s,t\in F}|f(s)-f(t)|   and, for , define the càdlàg modulus to be         ϖ  f  ′    (  δ  )    :=    inf  Π      max   1  ≤  i  ≤  k     w  f     (   [   t   i  -  1    ,   t  i   )   )      ,     assign     subscript   superscript  ϖ  normal-′   f   δ     subscript  infimum  normal-Π       subscript       1  i       k      subscript  w  f      subscript  t    i  1     subscript  t  i        \varpi^{\prime}_{f}(\delta):=\inf_{\Pi}\max_{1\leq i\leq k}w_{f}([t_{i-1},t_{i%
 })),   where the infimum runs over all partitions }, , with . This definition makes sense for non-càdlàg ƒ (just as the usual modulus of continuity makes sense for discontinuous functions) and it can be shown that ƒ is càdlàg if and only if  as .  Now let Λ denote the set of all strictly increasing , continuous bijections from E to itself (these are "wiggles in time"). Let       ∥  f  ∥   :=    sup   t  ∈  E     |   f   (  t  )    |       assign   norm  f     subscript  supremum    t  E        f  t       \|f\|:=\sup_{t\in E}|f(t)|   denote the uniform norm on functions on E . Define the Skorokhod metric  σ on D by        σ   (  f  ,  g  )    :=    inf   λ  ∈  Λ     max   {   ∥   λ  -  I   ∥   ,   ∥   f  -   g  ∘  λ    ∥   }      ,     assign    σ   f  g      subscript  infimum    λ  normal-Λ       norm    λ  I     norm    f    g  λ         \sigma(f,g):=\inf_{\lambda\in\Lambda}\max\{\|\lambda-I\|,\|f-g\circ\lambda\|\},   where  is the identity function. In terms of the "wiggle" intuition, |λ − I |{{!!}}}} measures the size of the "wiggle in time", and |ƒ − g○λ |{{!!}}}} measures the size of the "wiggle in space".  It can be shown that the Skorokhod metric is indeed a metric. The topology Σ generated by σ is called the Skorokhod topology on D .  Properties of Skorokhod space  Generalization of the uniform topology  The space C of continuous functions on E is a subspace of D . The Skorokhod topology relativized to C coincides with the uniform topology there.  Completeness  It can be shown (Convergence of probability measures - Billingsley 1999) that, although D is not a complete space with respect to the Skorokhod metric σ , there is a topologically equivalent metric  σ 0 with respect to which D is complete.  Separability  With respect to either σ or σ 0 , D is a separable space . Thus, Skorokhod space is a Polish space .  Tightness in Skorokhod space  By an application of the Arzelà–Ascoli theorem , one can show that a sequence ( μ n ) n =1,2,… of probability measures on Skorokhod space D is tight if and only if both the following conditions are met:         lim   a  →  ∞      lim sup   n  →  ∞      μ  n    (   {   f  ∈   D    |    ∥  f  ∥   ≥  a   }   )      =  0   ,        subscript    normal-→  a       subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript  μ  n    conditional-set    f  D      norm  f   a       0    \lim_{a\to\infty}\limsup_{n\to\infty}\mu_{n}\big(\{f\in D\;|\;\|f\|\geq a\}%
 \big)=0,   and        lim   δ  →  0      lim sup   n  →  ∞      μ  n    (   {   f  ∈   D    |     ϖ  f  ′    (  δ  )    ≥  ε   }   )      =   0  for all  ε   >  0.          subscript    normal-→  δ  0      subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript  μ  n    conditional-set    f  D        subscript   superscript  ϖ  normal-′   f   δ   ε         0  for all  ε        0.     \lim_{\delta\to 0}\limsup_{n\to\infty}\mu_{n}\big(\{f\in D\;|\;\varpi^{\prime}%
 _{f}(\delta)\geq\varepsilon\}\big)=0\text{ for all }\varepsilon>0.     Algebraic and topological structure  Under the Skorokhod topology and pointwise addition of functions, D is not a topological group, as can be seen by the following example:  Let    E  =   [  0  ,  2  )       E   0  2     E=[0,2)   be the unit interval and take     f  n   =   χ   [   1  -   1  /  n    ,  2  )    ∈  D         subscript  f  n    subscript  χ     1    1  n    2         D     f_{n}=\chi_{[1-1/n,2)}\in D   to be a sequence of characteristic functions. Despite the fact that     f  n   →   χ   [  1  ,  2  )       normal-→   subscript  f  n    subscript  χ   1  2      f_{n}\rightarrow\chi_{[1,2)}   in the Skorokhod topology, the sequence     f  n   -   χ   [  1  ,  2  )         subscript  f  n    subscript  χ   1  2      f_{n}-\chi_{[1,2)}   does not converge to 0.
