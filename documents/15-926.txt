   3-dehydroquinate synthase II      3-dehydroquinate synthase II   3-dehydroquinate synthase II (, DHQ synthase II , MJ1249 (gene) , aroB' (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name 2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonate:NAD + oxidoreductase (deaminating) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonate + H 2 O + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-dehydroquinate + NH 3 + NADH + H +    The enzyme was isolated from the archaeon  Methanocaldococcus jannaschii .
