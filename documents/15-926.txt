3-dehydroquinate synthase II

3-dehydroquinate synthase II (, DHQ synthase II, MJ1249 (gene), aroB' (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (deaminating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-amino-3,7-dideoxy-D-threo-hept-6-ulosonate + H2O + NAD+

 
  3-dehydroquinate + NH3 + NADH + H+


The enzyme was isolated from the archaeon Methanocaldococcus jannaschii.
