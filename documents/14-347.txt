   Chord names and symbols (popular music)      Chord names and symbols (popular music)   (Figure)  C 7 , or major seventh chord on C .   Various kinds of chord names and symbols are used in different contexts, to represent musical chords . In most genres of popular music , including jazz , pop , and rock , a chord name and the corresponding symbol are typically composed of one or more of the following parts:   The root note (e.g. C).  The chord quality (e.g. major , maj, or M).  The number of an interval (e.g. seventh, or 7), or less often its full name or symbol (e.g. major seventh , maj7, or M7).  The altered fifth (e.g. sharp five , or 5).  An additional interval number (e.g. add 13 or add13), in added tone chords .   For instance, the name C augmented seventh , and the corresponding symbol C aug7 , or C +7 , are both composed of parts 1, 2, and 3.  Except for the root, these parts do not refer to the notes which form the chord, but to the intervals they form with respect to the root. For instance, C aug7 indicates a chord formed by the notes C-E-G-B. The three parts of the symbol (C, aug, and 7) refer to the root C, the augmented (fifth) interval from C to G, and the (minor) seventh interval from C to B. A set of decoding rules is applied to deduce the missing information.  Although they are used occasionally in classical music , these names and symbols are "universally used in jazz and popular music", 1 usually inside lead sheets , fake books , and chord charts , to specify the harmony of compositions . Other notation systems for chords include: 2 plain staff notation , used in classical music, Roman numerals , commonly used in harmonic analysis , 3  figured bass , much used in the Baroque era , and macro symbols , sometimes used in modern musicology .  Advantages and limitations  Any chord can be denoted using staff notation , showing not only its harmonic characteristics but also its exact voicing . However, this notation, frequently used in classical music, may provide too much information, making improvisation difficult. In fact, although voicings can and do have a significant effect on the subjective musical qualities of a composition , generally these interpretations retain the central characteristics of the chord. This provides an opportunity for improvisation within a defined structure and is important to improvised music such as jazz . Other problems are that voicings for one instrument are not necessarily physically playable on another (for example, the thirteenth chord , played on piano with up to seven notes, is usually played on guitar as a 4- or 5-note voicing that is impossible to play on piano with one hand).  As a result of these limitations, a shorthand which describes the harmonic characteristics of chords is used in pop music and jazz. This notation has an advantage of being more easily expressed in plain text and in handwriting than the relatively complicated process of writing chords on a staff. It is also faster to read.  The first part of a symbol for a chord defines the root of the chord. The root of the chord will always be played by one of the instruments in the ensemble (usually by a bass instrument) – failure to include the root means that the indicated chord is not being played. By convention, the root alone indicates a simple major triad, i.e., the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. After this, various additional symbols are added to modify this chord. There is unfortunately no universal standard for these symbols. The most common ones are to be presented following here, below.  This notation does not easily provide for ways of describing all chords. Some chords can be very difficult to notate, and others that exist theoretically are rarely encountered. For example, there are 6 possible permutations of triads (chords with three notes) involving minor or major thirds and perfect, augmented, or diminished fifths. However, conventionally only four are used (major, minor, augmented and diminished). There is nothing to stop a composer using the other two, but the question of what to call them is interesting. A minor third with an augmented fifth might be denoted, for example, by Am + , which will strike most musicians as odd. In fact, this turns out to be the same as F/A (see slash chords below). A major third with a diminished fifth might be shown as A(5).  Usually, when composers require a chord that is not easily described using this notation, they will indicate the required chord in a footnote or in the header of the music.  Chord quality  Chord qualities are related with the qualities of the component intervals which define the chord (see below). The main chord qualities are:  :* Major , and minor .  :* Augmented , diminished , and half-diminished .  :* Dominant .  Some of the symbols used for chord quality are similar to those used for interval quality :  :* m , or min for minor,  :* M , maj , or no symbol (see rule 2 below ) for major,  :* aug for augmented,  :* dim for diminished.  In addition, however,  :* is sometimes used for major, instead of the standard M, or maj,  :* − is sometimes used for minor, instead of the standard m or min,  :* + , or aug , is used for augmented ( A is not used),  :* , ° , dim , is used for diminished ( d is not used),  :* , or Ø is used for half diminished,  :* dom is used for dominant.  Chord qualities are sometimes omitted (see below ). When specified, they appear immediately after the root note or, if the root is omitted, at the beginning of the chord name or symbol. For instance, in the symbol Cm7 (C minor seventh chord ) C is the root and m is the chord quality. When the terms minor, major, augmented, diminished, or the corresponding symbols do not appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the name or symbol, they should be considered interval qualities , rather than chord qualities. For instance, in Cm/M7 ( minor major seventh chord ), m is the chord quality and M refers to the M7 interval.  Major, minor, augmented, and diminished chords  3-note chords are called triads . There are four basic triads ( major , minor , augmented , diminished ). They are all tertian , which means defined by the root, a third interval, and a fifth interval . Since most other chords are obtained by adding one or more notes to these triads, the name and symbol of a chord is often built by just adding an interval number to the name and symbol of a triad. For instance, a C augmented seventh chord is a C augmented triad with an extra note defined by a minor seventh interval:        C+7   =   C+   +   m7     augmented chord    augmented triad    minor interval       In this case, the quality of the additional interval is omitted. Less often, the full name or symbol of the additional interval (minor, in the example) is provided. For instance, a C augmented major seventh chord is a C augmented triad with an extra note defined by a major seventh interval:        C+ M7   =   C+   +   M7     augmented chord    augmented triad    major interval       In both cases, the quality of the chord is the same as the quality of the basic triad it contains. This is not true for all chord qualities, as the chord qualities "half-diminished", and "dominant" refer not only to the quality of the basic triad, but also to the quality of the additional intervals.  Altered fifths  A more complex approach is sometimes used to name and denote augmented and diminished chords. An augmented triad can be viewed as a major triad in which the perfect fifth interval (spanning 7 semitones ) has been substituted with an augmented fifth (8 semitones), and a diminished triad as a minor triad in which the perfect fifth has been substituted with a diminished fifth (6 semitones). In this case, the augmented triad can be named major triad sharp five , or major triad augmented fifth (M 5 , M +5 , maj aug5 ). Similarly, the diminished triad can be named minor triad flat five , or minor triad diminished fifth (m 5 , m °5 , min dim5 ).  Again, the terminology and notation used for triads affects the terminology and notation used for larger chords, formed by four or more notes. For instance, the above mentioned C augmented major seventh chord, is sometimes called C major seventh sharp five , or C major seventh augmented fifth . The corresponding symbol is CM7 +5 , CM7 5 , or Cmaj7 aug5 :        CM7 +5   =   C   +   M3   +   A5   +   M7     augmented chord    chord root    major interval    augmented interval    major interval        (In chord symbols, the symbol A , used for augmented intervals, is typically replaced by + or )   In this case, the chord is viewed as a C major seventh chord (CM7) in which the third note is an augmented fifth from root (G), rather than a perfect fifth from root (G). All chord names and symbols including altered fifths, i.e. augmented (5, +5, aug5) or diminished (5, °5, dim5) fifths can be interpreted in a similar way.  Rules to decode chord names and symbols  The amount of information provided in a chord name or symbol lean toward the minimum, to increase efficiency. However, it is often necessary to deduce from a chord name or symbol the component intervals which define the chord. The missing information is implied and must be deduced according to some conventional rules:   General rule to interpret existing information about chord quality   For triads, major or minor always refer to the third interval, while augmented and diminished always refer to the fifth. The same is true for the corresponding symbols (e.g., Cm means Cm3, and C+ means C+5). Thus, the terms third and fifth and the corresponding symbols 3 and 5 are typically omitted.  This rule can be generalized to all kinds of chords, provided the above mentioned qualities appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the chord name or symbol. For instance, in the chord symbols Cm and Cm7, m refers to the interval m3, and 3 is omitted. When these qualities do not appear immediately after the root note, or at the beginning of the name or symbol, they should be considered interval qualities , rather than chord qualities. For instance, in Cm/M7 ( minor-major seventh chord ), m is the chord quality and refers to the m3 interval, while M refers to the M7 interval. When the number of an extra interval is specified immediately after chord quality, the quality of that interval may coincide with chord quality (e.g. CM7 = CM/M7). However, this is not always true (e.g. Cm6 = Cm/M6, C+7 = C+/m7, CM11 = CM/P11). See specific rules below for further details.   General rule to deduce missing information about chord quality   Without contrary information, a major third interval and a perfect fifth interval ( major triad ) are implied. For instance, a C chord is a C major triad, and the name C minor seventh (Cm7) implies a minor 3rd by rule 1, a perfect 5th by this rule, and a minor 7th by definition (see below). This rule has one exception (see the first specific rule below).   Specific rules   When the fifth interval is diminished , the third must be minor. This rule overrides rule 2. For instance, Cdim7 implies a diminished 5th by rule 1, a minor 3rd by this rule, and a diminished 7th by definition (see below).  Names and symbols which contain only a plain interval number (e.g. “Seventh chord”) or the chord root and a number (e.g. “C seventh”, or C7) are interpreted as follows: :*If the number is 2, 4, 6, etc., the chord is a major added tone chord (e.g. C6 = CM6 = Cadd6) and contains, together with the implied major triad, an extra major 2nd , perfect 4th , or major 6th (see below ). Note that 2 and 4 are sometimes also used to abbreviate suspended chords (e.g. C2 = Csus2).  :*If the number is 7, 9, 11, 13, etc., the chord is dominant (e.g. C7 = Cdom7) and contains, together with the implied major triad, one or more of the following extra intervals: minor 7th, major 9th, perfect 11th, and major 13th (see Seventh chords and Extended chords below).  :*If the number is 5, the chord (technically not a chord in the traditional sense, but a dyad ) is a power chord . Only the root, a perfect fifth and usually an octave are played.   For sixth chord names or symbols composed only of root, quality and number (such as "C major sixth", or "CM6"): :* M, maj, or major stands for major-major (e.g. CM6 means CM/M6),  :* m, min, or minor stands for minor-major (e.g. Cm6 means Cm/M6).   For seventh chord names or symbols composed only of root, quality and number (such as "C major seventh", or "CM7"): :* dom, or dominant stands for major-minor (e.g. Cdom7 means CM/m7),  :* M, maj, or major stands for major-major (e.g. CM7 means CM/M7),  :* m, min, or minor stands for minor-minor (e.g. Cm7 means Cm/m7),  :* +, aug, or augmented stands for augmented-minor (e.g. C+7 means C+/m7),  :* , dim, or diminished stands for diminished-diminished (e.g. C7 means C/7),  :* , or half-diminished stands for diminished-minor (e.g. C7 means C/m7).   Other specific rules for extended and added tone chords are given below.    Examples  The table shows the application of these generic and specific rules to interpret some of the main chord symbols. The same rules apply for the analysis of chord names. A limited amount of information is explicitly provided in the chord symbol ( boldface font in the column labeled "Component intervals"), and can be interpreted with rule 1. The rest is implied (plain font), and can be deduced by applying the other rules. The "Analysis of symbol parts" is performed by applying rule 1.

Except for the root, all the other parts of the symbols may be either superscripted or subscripted . Sometimes, parts of the symbol may be separated by a slash , or written within parentheses . For instance:   CM7 may be written CM 7 , C M7 , CM 7 , or C M7 .  Cm M7 may be written as Cm M7 , Cm/M7, Cm(M7), or simply CmM7.   Short and long symbols for chord quality (such as m for minor and maj for major, respectively) are sometimes both used in the same chord symbol. For instance:   Cm(M7) may be also written Cm(maj7).   Intervals  A chord consists of two or more notes played simultaneously that are certain intervals apart with respect to the chord root. The following table shows the labels given to these intervals and the respective notes for each of the twelve keys. As explained above, chord notation provides a shorthand for intervals, not actual notes. This table provides a mapping of intervals to actual notes to play.

It consists of the root, the major third, and the perfect fifth above the root. Minor triads are the same as major triads, but with the third lowered by a half step . Augmented triads are the same as a major triad, but with an augmented fifth instead of a perfect fifth . Diminished triads are similar to minor triads, but with a diminished fifth instead of a perfect fifth (the minor third is retained).  The table below shows names, symbols and definition for the four kinds of triads (using C as root).

Note that the diminished seventh note is enharmonically equivalent to the major sixth above the root of the chord. When not otherwise specified, the name "seventh chord" may more specifically refer to a major triad with an added minor seventh (a dominant seventh chord ).

See Examples above for further details.  Some 7th chords can be considered as triad chords with alternate bass . For instance,   Cm7 = C-E-G-B = E/C  Cmaj7 = C-E-G-B = Em/C   Extended chords  Extended chords add further notes onto 7th chords. Of the 7 notes in the major scale, a seventh chord uses only 4. The other 3 notes can be added in any combination; however, just as with the triads and seventh chords, notes are most commonly stacked – a seventh implies that there is a fifth and a third and a root. In practice, especially in jazz, certain notes can be omitted without changing the quality of the chord.  The 9th, 11th and 13th chords are known as extended tertian chords. As the scale repeats for every seven notes in the scale, these notes are enharmonically equivalent to the 2nd, 4th, and 6th – except they are more than an octave above the root. However, this does not mean that they must be played in the higher octave. Although changing the octave of certain notes in a chord (within reason) does change the way the chord sounds, it does not change the essential characteristics or tendency of it. Accordingly, using 9th, 11th and 13th in chord notation implies that the chord is an extended tertian chord rather than an added chord (see Added Chords below).  9ths  9th chords are built by adding to a seventh chord a note which is an interval of a ninth from root. This implies that the 7th note from root is also included in the chord. When the 7th is omitted, the chord cannot be classified as an extended chord, as it becomes an added tone chord . 9ths may be theoretically added to any type of chord, however they are most commonly seen with Major, Dominant and Minor sevenths.  The most commonly omitted note for voicings is the perfect 5th.  The table below shows names, symbols, and definitions for the various kinds of ninth chords (using C as root)      Name   Symbol   Quality of added 9th   Notes       Short   Long     (Major) 9th   CM 9 / C 9   Cmaj 9   Major     Dominant 9th   C 9   Cdom 9   Major     Minor Major 9th   Cm M9 / C− M9   Cmin maj9   Major     Minor Dominant 9th   Cm 9 / C− 9   Cmin 9   Major     Augmented Major 9th   C+ M9   Caug maj9   Major     Augmented Dominant 9th   C+ 9 / C 95   Caug 9   Major     Half-Diminished 9th   C Ø9    Major     Half-Diminished Minor 9th   C Ø9    Minor     Diminished 9th   C° 9   Cdim 9   Major     Diminished Minor 9th   C° 9   Cdim 9   Minor     11ths  These are theoretically 9th chords with the 11th (4th) note in the scale added. However, it is common to leave certain notes out. The major 3rd is often omitted because of a strong dissonance with the 11th (4th), therefore called an avoid note . Omission of the 3rd reduces an 11th chord to the corresponding 9sus4 ( suspended 9th chord; Aiken 2004 , p. 104). Similarly, omission of the 3rd as well as 5th in C11 results in a major chord with alternate base B/C, which is characteristic in soul and gospel music. For instance:  C 11 without 3rd = C-(E)-G-B-D-F ≈ C-F-G-B-D = C 9sus4 C 11 without 3rd and 5th = C-(E)-(G)-B-D-F ≈ C-F-B-D = B/C  If the 9th is omitted, the chord is no longer an extended chord, but an added tone chord (see below). Without the 3rd, this added tone chord becomes a 7sus4 (suspended 7th chord). For instance:  C 11 without 9th = C7 add11 = C-E-G-B-(D)-F C7 add11 without 3rd = C-(E)-G-B-(D)-F ≈ C-F-G-B = C 7sus4  The table below shows names, symbols, and definitions for the various kinds of eleventh chords (using C as root)      Name   Symbol   Quality of added 11th   Notes       Short   Long     11th (dominant 11th)   C 11   Cdom 11   Perfect     Major 11th   CM 11   Cmaj 11   Perfect     Minor-Major 11th   Cm M11 / C− M11   Cmin maj11   Perfect     Minor 11th   Cm 11 / C− 11   Cmin 11   Perfect     Augmented-Major 11th   C+ M11   Caug maj11   Perfect     Augmented 11th   C+ 11 / C 115   Caug 11   Perfect     Half-Diminished 11th   C Ø11    Perfect     Diminished 11th   C° 11   Cdim 11   Diminished     Alterations from the natural diatonic chords can be specified as C 911 ... etc. Omission of the 5th in a sharpened 11th chord reduces its sound to a flat-five chord. ( Aiken 2004 , p. 94):  C 911 = C-E-(G)-B-D-F ≈ C-E-G-B-D = C 95  13ths  These are theoretically 11th chords with the 13th (or 6th) note in the scale added. In other words, theoretically they are formed by all the seven notes of a diatonic scale at once. Again, it is common to leave certain notes out. After the 5th, the most commonly omitted note is the troublesome 11th (4th). The 9th (2nd) can also be omitted. A very common voicing on guitar for a 13th chord is just the root, 3rd, 7th and 13th (or 6th). For example: C-E-(G)-B-(D)-(F)-A, or C-E-(G)-A-B-(D)-(F). On the piano, this is usually voiced C-Bb-E-A.

The combination of 9th (2nd), 11th (4th) and 13th (6th) notes with 7ths in a chord give jazz chord voicing their distinctive sound. However the use of these notes is not exclusive to the jazz genre; in fact they are very commonly used in folk, classical and popular music generally. Without the 7th, these chords lose their jazzy feel, but can still be very complex. These chords are called added tone chords because they are basic triads with notes added. They can be described as having a more open sound than extended chords. Notation must provide some way of showing that a chord is an added tone chord as opposed to extended. There are two ways this is shown generally, and it is very common to see both methods on the same score. One way is to simply use the word 'add', for example:   C add9   The second way is to use 2 instead of 9, implying that it is not a 7th chord for instance:   C 2   Note that in this way we potentially get other ways of showing a 9th chord:   C 7add9  C 7add2  C 7/9   Generally however the above will be shown as simply C 9 , which implies a 7th in the chord. Added tone chord notation is useful with 7th chords to indicate partial extended chords. For example:   C 7add13   This would indicate that the 13th is added to the 7th, but without the 9th and 11th.  The use of 2, 4 and 6 as opposed to 9, 11 and 13 indicates that the chord does not include a 7th unless specifically specified. However, it does not mean that these notes must be played within an octave of the root, nor the extended notes in 7th chords should be played outside of the octave, although it is commonly the case. 6 is particularly common in a minor sixth chord (also known as minor/major sixth chord, as the 6 refers to a major sixth interval).  It is possible to have added tone chords with more than one added note. The most commonly encountered of these are 6/9 chords , which are basic triads with the 6th and 2nd notes of the scale added. These can be confusing because of the use of 9, yet the chord does not include the 7th. A good rule of thumb is that if any added note is less than 7, then no 7th is implied, even if there are some notes shown as greater than 7.  Similarly, even numbers such as 8, 10 and 12 can be added. However, these double the main triad, and as such are fairly rare. 10 tends to be the most common; it can be used both in suspended chords and (with an accidental) in major or minor chords to produce a major-minor clash (e.g. C 7(10) indicating the Hendrix chord of C-E-E-G-B). However, because of enharmonics , such chords can more easily, and perhaps more intuitively, be represented by 2 (or 9) for a minor over a major or 4 for a major over a minor. In any other case, an 8, 10 or 12 simply indicates the respective note from the triad doubled up one octave.  Suspended chords  A suspended chord is a triad where the 3rd is replaced by another note. In practice the 3rd is replaced either by the 4th or the 2nd. These chords "desire" to resolve into a normal triad. Suspended chords are notated with the symbols "sus4" or "sus2". Where "sus" is found on its own, the suspended fourth chord is implied. This can be combined with any other notation. So for example:   C9sus 4   This chord is an extended 9th chord with the 3rd replaced by the 4th (C-F-G-B-D). However, the major third can be added as a tension above the 4th to "colorize" the chord (C-F-G-B-D-E). A sus4 chord with the added major third (sometimes called a major 10th) can also be quartally voiced as C-F-B-E.  Power "chords"  Though power chords are not true chords per se , they are still expressed using a version of chord notation. Most commonly, power chords (e.g. C-G-C) are expressed using a "5" (e.g. C 5 ). Power chords are also referred to as fifth chords , indeterminate chords or neutral chords (though the term "neutral chord," when expressed with an n (e.g. Cn), is also used to describe a pair of stacked neutral thirds , e.g. C-E-G, which requires a quarter tone or similarly sized microtone; or the mixed third chord), since they are inherently neither major nor minor; generally, a power chord refers to a specific doubled-root, three-note voicing of a fifth chord.  In the event that an extended neutral chord is to be played, e.g. a seventh (C-G-B), the chord is expressed as its corresponding extended chord notation with the addition of the words "no3rd," "no3" or the like. The aforementioned chord, for instance, would be indicated C 7 no3.  Chords containing quarter tones  While not a common trend with composers, the method by which chord names and symbols are used in popular music can be adapted to naming chords that contain quarter tones .  Neutral chords  Neutral chords are chords built entirely by stacking neutral thirds (the interval between a major and minor third). While the neutral triad can sound like major or minor depending on context, it can also be thought of as a chord quality in its own right. An example of the neutral triad would be C-E-G where the E exists halfway between E and E. The neutral triad is quite rare and is more commonly seen as the neutral seventh chord such as C E G B. These chords are composed of two fifths being a neutral third apart. The chord symbol can be written with a lowercase "n" or "neut" following the root such as Cn 7 . Neutral chords can also be extended to higher degrees such as ninths and elevenths. While there is no universally accepted series of notes for larger neutral chords, it makes sense to consider that higher extensions to the chord would be built in the same manner that the seventh chord is, by a series of neutral thirds.  Supermajor and subminor  Supermajor chords are major triads that have the third raised a quarter tone higher than normal. Such a triad is arguably either an altered version of a suspended chord or a unique triad in its own right. Subminor chords are minor triads that have the third lowered by a quarter tone. An example of a supermajor triad would be C-E-G, in which E exists halfway between E and F. An example of a subminor triad would be C-E-G in which E exists halfway between D and E. Supermajor triads can be written with "sup" or a capital "S" following the root while subminor can be written with "sub" or a small "s". The previous examples would therefore be Csup or CS, and Csub or Cs. Because triads such as these rarely appear in musical context, they are considered to be purely theoretical in terms of their usage.  In addition, sevenths can be theoretically created as well based on keeping the relationship of a chord having two perfect fifths the same. While a C major seventh chord would have a major third and major seventh, Csup 7 would contain a supermajor third (E) and a supermajor seventh (B). Csub 7 would contain a subminor third (E) and a subminor seventh (B). Arguably, higher extensions could be used as well, producing chord names such as Csup 11 or Csub 139 .  Inversions  In addition to all of the ways of building chords (listed above), a chord may be inverted. Inverting a chord refers to playing a chord, but with a note other than the root as the lowest note of the chord. Take, for example, the C major and the C dominant seventh chords. Refer to the tables below for a list of inversions.      C major chord        Notes     Short notation         C dominant seventh chord        Notes     Short notation     The notation C/E indicates a C major chord, but with an E in the bass. Likewise the notation C/G indicates that a C major chord is played with a G in the bass.  See figured bass for alternate method of notating specific notes in the bass.  Hybrid chords  Upper structures  Those are notated in a similar manner to inversions, except that the bass note is not necessarily a chord tone. Examples:   C/A (A C E G), equivalent to A 75;  C/E (E G C F);  Am/D (D A C E).   Chord notation in jazz usually leaves a certain amount of freedom to the player as for voicing chords, also adding tensions at the player's discretion. Therefore, upper structures are most useful when the composer wishes for a specific tension array to be played. Example:      4  4      4  4    \textstyle\frac{4}{4}   C/E | C/A E/A | D/E G 75/A | E add 2 /D D79/G | Am7/C ||  produces a certain coloration of the following chord progression:      4  4      4  4    \textstyle\frac{4}{4}   E7 | Am7 A7 | Em7 A7 | D G7 | C ||  These are also commonly referred as " slash chords ." A slash chord is simply a chord placed on top of a different bass note; for example:   D/F# is a D chord with F# in the bass;  A/C# is an A chord with C# in the bass.   Slash chords generally do not indicate a simple inversion (which is usually left to the player's discretion anyway), especially considering that the requested bass note may not be part of the chord to be played on top. The requested bass note may be played instead of or in addition to the chord's usual root note, though the root note, when played, is likely to be played only in a higher octave to avoid "colliding" with the new bass note.  Polychords  Polychords, as the name suggests, are combinations of two or more chords. The most commonly found form of a polychord is a bi-chord (two chords played simultaneously) and is written as follows      u  p  p  e  r  c  h  o  r  d    l  o  w  e  r  c  h  o  r  d          u  p  p  e  r  c  h  o  r  d     l  o  w  e  r  c  h  o  r  d     \textstyle\frac{upperchord}{lowerchord}   (example     B  C       B  C    \textstyle\frac{B}{C}   (C E G B D F)). In case a very specific voicing is needed, the individual chords can be written in their desired inversions, for example        E  b  m   /  G   b    C  d  r  o  p  2              E  b  m   G   b     C  d  r  o  p  2     \textstyle\frac{Ebm/Gb}{Cdrop2}   (C G E G B E).  Other symbols  The right slash  / or diagonal line written above the staff where chord symbols occur is used to indicate a beat during which the most recent chord symbol is understood to continue. It is used to help make uneven harmonic rhythms more readable. For example, if written above a measure of standard time, "C / F G" would mean that the C chord symbol lasts two beats while F and G last one beat each. The slash is separated from the surrounding chord symbols so as not to be confused with the chord-over-a-bass-note notation that also uses a slash.  For chord abbreviations, the right slash indicates the bass note if other than the root. It is usually written with the complete chord name, and, after the slash symbol, the desired bass note. For example, the symbol C/G would mean that the chord to play is a C major triad with a G as the bass note, leading to the following notes: G C E (commonly known as the 2nd inversion C major triad).  A right slash surrounded by two dots 𝄎 reminiscent of a percent sign % [illustration needed] in an otherwise empty measure indicates that the chord or chords of the previous measure are to be repeated. It can be reused over many consecutive measures. It is used to simplify the job of both the reader (who can quickly scan ahead to the next chord change) and the copyist (who doesn't need to write out the full chord symbols repeatedly).  The chord notation N.C. is used to indicate no chord is to be played. The duration of this symbol follows the same rules as a regular chord symbol.  Summary  Since the rules to decode chord notation are complex, a short article would not be sufficient to describe them clearly and exhaustively. As a consequence, this article is relatively long and not easy to decipher at a glance. This section is included as a brief summary of one of the notations described, aimed more at the performer's perspective, rather than that of the composer or theorist.  As shown above , the symbol Cmin maj13 indicates a chord whose root is C , with each of the odd-numbered intervals, up to the one indicated (13th in this case) placed above it. Namely, the chord is defined by the following odd-numbered intervals:   Minor third (C-E)  Perfect fifth (C-G)  Major seventh (C-B)  Major ninth (C-D)  Perfect eleventh (C-F)  Major thirteenth (C-A)   Notice that all the intervals are major or perfect, except for the third which is minor, as specified by min in the symbol. By comparing other chord symbols to Cmin maj13 , with the following set of rules it is possible to decode several other chord symbols:   When the interval name ( maj13 ) is omitted, it is understood to be a 5th, which implies that the chord is a triad .  When the interval quality ( maj ) is omitted, it causes the 7th (if present) to be flattened (from major to minor)  When the chord quality ( min ) is omitted, the 3rd is assumed to be major  When the chord quality is min (as in the example above), the 3rd is flattened (from major to minor)  When the chord quality is aug , the 5th is sharpened (from perfect to augmented)  When the chord quality is dim , each of the intervals is flattened  When the chord quality is sus or sus4 , the 3rd is sharpened (from major to augmented, equivalent to a perfect 4th)  When the chord quality is sus2 the 3rd is double-flattened (from major to diminished, equivalent to a major 2nd)   For instance, Cdim9 indicates a chord whose root is C , with a flattened 3rd, a flattened 5th, a double-flattened 7th (flattened once by the presence of dim , and flattened again by the omission of the maj ) and a flattened 9th.  When a small even number is used as the main interval: 2 is equivalent to 9 , 4 is equivalent to 11 , and 6 is equivalent to 13 ; but with the omission of the 7th, possibly implied in each case; and when the number is explicitly stated as a 5 , it implies the omission of the 3rd.  In the vast majority of cases, though, none of this complexity is involved. A typical piece of music might stipulate chords like C , F , Amin , and G7 , giving (according to the summary above) two major triads, a minor triad, and an extended chord of four notes.
