   Fernandez’s method      Fernandez’s method   Fernandez's method (FB) is a method which is used in the multiprocessing scheduling algorithm . It is actually used to improve the quality of the lower bounding schemes which are adopted by branch and bound algorithms for solving multiprocessor scheduling problem. Fernandez's problem derives a better lower bound than HF ,and propose a quadratic-time algorithm from calculating the bound. It is known that a straightforward calculation of FB takes O $(n^3)$ time, since it must examine O $(n^2)$ combinations each of which takes O $(n)$ time in the worst case.
