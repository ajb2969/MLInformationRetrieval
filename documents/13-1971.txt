   Mass action law (electronics)      Mass action law (electronics)   Under thermal equilibrium the product of the free electron concentration   n   n   n   and the free hole concentration   p   p   p   is equal to a constant equal to the square of intrinsic carrier concentration    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   . The intrinsic carrier concentration is a function of temperature.  The equation for the mass action law for semiconductors is: 1       n  p   =   n  i  2         n  p    superscript   subscript  n  i   2     np=n_{i}^{2}     Carrier Concentrations  In semiconductors, free electrons and holes are the carriers that provide conduction . For cases where the number of carriers are much less than the number of band states, the carrier concentrations can be approximated by using Boltzmann statistics , giving the results below.  Electron Concentration  The free electron concentration n can be approximated by      n  =    N  c   exp   [   -    (    E  c   -   E  F    )    k  T     ]        n     subscript  N  c   exp   delimited-[]         subscript  E  c    subscript  E  F      k  T         n=N_{c}\text{ exp}\left[-\frac{(E_{c}-E_{F})}{kT}\right]   where   E c is the energy of the conduction band  E F is the energy of the Fermi level  k is the Boltzmann constant  T is the temperature in Kelvins  N c is the effective density of states at the conduction band edge given by     N  c   =   2    (    2  π   m  e  *   k  T    h  2    )    3  /  2          subscript  N  c     2   superscript      2  π   superscript   subscript  m  e     k  T    superscript  h  2      3  2       \textstyle N_{c}=2\left(\frac{2\pi m_{e}^{*}kT}{h^{2}}\right)^{3/2}   , with m* e being the electron effective mass and h being the planck constant .   Hole Concentration  The free hole concentration p is given by a similar formula      p  =    N  v   exp   [   -    (    E  F   -   E  v    )    k  T     ]        p     subscript  N  v   exp   delimited-[]         subscript  E  F    subscript  E  v      k  T         p=N_{v}\text{ exp}\left[-\frac{(E_{F}-E_{v})}{kT}\right]   where   E F is the energy of the Fermi level  E v is the energy of the valence band  k is the Boltzmann constant  T is the temperature in Kelvins  N v is the effective density of states at the valence band edge given by     N  v   =   2    (    2  π   m  h  *   k  T    h  2    )    3  /  2          subscript  N  v     2   superscript      2  π   superscript   subscript  m  h     k  T    superscript  h  2      3  2       \textstyle N_{v}=2\left(\frac{2\pi m_{h}^{*}kT}{h^{2}}\right)^{3/2}   , with m* h being the hole effective mass and h being the planck constant .   Mass Action Law  Using the carrier concentration equations given above, the mass action law can then be stated as       n  p   =    N  c    N  v   exp   (   -    E  g    k  T     )    =   n  i  2           n  p      subscript  N  c    subscript  N  v   exp       subscript  E  g     k  T            superscript   subscript  n  i   2      np=N_{c}N_{v}\text{ exp}\left(-\frac{E_{g}}{kT}\right)=n_{i}^{2}   where E g is the bandgap energy given by E g = E c − E v  See also   Law of mass action   References    External links   Doping, Carrier Concentration, Mobility, and Conductivity  Semi-conductor tutorial   "  Category:Electronic engineering  Category:Empirical laws     ↩
