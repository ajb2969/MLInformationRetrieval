Mass action law (electronics)

Under thermal equilibrium the product of the free electron concentration 
 
 
 
  and the free hole concentration 
 
 
 
  is equal to a constant equal to the square of intrinsic carrier concentration 
 
 
 
 . The intrinsic carrier concentration is a function of temperature.
The equation for the mass action law for semiconductors is:1



Carrier Concentrations
In semiconductors, free electrons and holes are the carriers that provide conduction. For cases where the number of carriers are much less than the number of band states, the carrier concentrations can be approximated by using Boltzmann statistics, giving the results below.
Electron Concentration
The free electron concentration n can be approximated by


 
  where

Ec is the energy of the conduction band
EF is the energy of the Fermi level
k is the Boltzmann constant
T is the temperature in Kelvins
Nc is the effective density of states at the conduction band edge given by 
 
 
 
 , with m*e being the electron effective mass and h being the planck constant.

Hole Concentration
The free hole concentration p is given by a similar formula


 
  where

EF is the energy of the Fermi level
Ev is the energy of the valence band
k is the Boltzmann constant
T is the temperature in Kelvins
Nv is the effective density of states at the valence band edge given by 
 
 
 
 , with m*h being the hole effective mass and h being the planck constant.

Mass Action Law
Using the carrier concentration equations given above, the mass action law can then be stated as


 
  where Eg is the bandgap energy given by Eg = Ec âˆ’ Ev
