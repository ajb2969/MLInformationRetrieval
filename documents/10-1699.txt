Retinal isomerase




Retinal isomerase

In enzymology, a retinal isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the isomerisation of trans Retinal in eye into 11-cis-retinal which is form sutiable to bind with protein opsin

all-trans-retinal 
 
 
 
  11-cis-retinal
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, all-trans-retinal, and one product, 11-cis-retinal.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is all-trans-retinal 11-cis-trans-isomerase. Other names in common use include retinene isomerase, and retinoid isomerase. This enzyme participates in retinol metabolism.
