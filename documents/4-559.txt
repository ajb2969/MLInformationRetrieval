   Sperner family      Sperner family   In combinatorics , a Sperner family (or Sperner system ), named in honor of Emanuel Sperner , is a family of sets ( F , E ) in which none of the sets is contained in another. Equivalently, a Sperner family is an antichain in the inclusion lattice over the power set of E . A Sperner family is also sometimes called an independent system or a clutter .  Sperner families are counted by the Dedekind numbers , and their size is bounded by Sperner's theorem and the Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality . They may also be described in the language of hypergraphs rather than set families, where they are called clutters .  Dedekind numbers  The number of different Sperner families on a set of n elements is counted by the Dedekind numbers , the first few of which are   2, 3, 6, 20, 168, 7581, 7828354, 2414682040998, 56130437228687557907788 .   Although accurate asymptotic estimates are known for larger values of n , it is unknown whether there exists an exact formula that can be used to compute these numbers efficiently.  Bounds on the size of a Sperner family  Sperner's theorem  The k -element subsets of an n -element set form a Sperner family, the size of which is maximized when k = n /2 (or the nearest integer to it). Sperner's theorem states that these families are the largest possible Sperner families over an n -element set. Formally, the theorem states that, for every Sperner family S over an n -element set,        |  S  |   ≤   (     n       ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋      )    .        S    binomial  n      n  2       |S|\leq{\left({{n}\atop{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}}\right)}.     LYM inequality  The Lubell–Yamamoto–Meshalkin inequality provides another bound on the size of a Sperner family, and can be used to prove Sperner's theorem. It states that, if a k denotes the number of sets of size k in a Sperner family over a set of n elements, then        ∑   k  =  0   n     a  k    (      n      k      )     ≤  1.        superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  a  k    binomial  n  k     1.    \sum_{k=0}^{n}\frac{a_{k}}{{n\choose k}}\leq 1.     Clutters  A clutter  H is a hypergraph     (  V  ,  E  )     V  E    (V,E)   , with the added property that    A  ⊈  B     not-subset-of-or-equals  A  B    A\not\subseteq B   whenever     A  ,  B   ∈  E       A  B   E    A,B\in E   and    A  ≠  B      A  B    A\neq B   (i.e. no edge properly contains another). That is, the sets of vertices represented by the hyperedges form a Sperner family. Clutters are an important structure in the study of combinatorial optimization. An opposite notion to a clutter is an abstract simplicial complex , where every subset of an edge is contained in the hypergraph (this is an order ideal in the poset of subsets of E ).  If    H  =   (  V  ,  E  )       H   V  E     H=(V,E)   is a clutter, then the blocker of H , denoted    b   (  H  )       b  H    b(H)   , is the clutter with vertex set V and edge set consisting of all minimal sets    B  ⊆  V      B  V    B\subseteq V   so that     B  ∩  A   ≠  ∅        B  A      B\cap A\neq\varnothing   for every    A  ∈  E      A  E    A\in E   . It can be shown that     b   (   b   (  H  )    )    =  H        b    b  H    H    b(b(H))=H   , so blockers give us a type of duality. We define    ν   (  H  )       ν  H    \nu(H)   to be the size of the largest collection of disjoint edges in H and    τ   (  H  )       τ  H    \tau(H)   to be the size of the smallest edge in    b   (  H  )       b  H    b(H)   . It is easy to see that     ν   (  H  )    ≤   τ   (  H  )          ν  H     τ  H     \nu(H)\leq\tau(H)   .  Examples   If G is a simple loopless graph, then    H  =   (   V   (  G  )    ,   E   (  G  )    )       H     V  G     E  G      H=(V(G),E(G))   is a clutter and    b   (  H  )       b  H    b(H)   is the collection of all minimal vertex covers . Here    ν   (  H  )       ν  H    \nu(H)   is the size of the largest matching and    τ   (  H  )       τ  H    \tau(H)   is the size of the smallest vertex cover. König's theorem states that, for bipartite graphs ,     ν   (  H  )    =   τ   (  H  )          ν  H     τ  H     \nu(H)=\tau(H)   . However for other graphs these two quantities may differ.  Let G be a graph and let     s  ,  t   ∈   V   (  G  )         s  t     V  G     s,t\in V(G)   . Define    H  =   (  V  ,  E  )       H   V  E     H=(V,E)   by setting    V  =   E   (  G  )        V    E  G     V=E(G)   and letting E be the collection of all edge-sets of s - t paths. Then H is a clutter, and    b   (  H  )       b  H    b(H)   is the collection of all minimal edge cuts which separate s and t . In this case    ν   (  H  )       ν  H    \nu(H)   is the maximum number of edge-disjoint s - t paths, and    τ   (  H  )       τ  H    \tau(H)   is the size of the smallest edge-cut separating s and t , so Menger's theorem (edge-connectivity version) asserts that     ν   (  H  )    =   τ   (  H  )          ν  H     τ  H     \nu(H)=\tau(H)   .  Let G be a connected graph and let H be the clutter on    E   (  G  )       E  G    E(G)   consisting of all edge sets of spanning trees of G . Then    b   (  H  )       b  H    b(H)   is the collection of all minimal edge cuts in G .   Minors  There is a minor relation on clutters which is similar to the minor relation on graphs. If    H  =   (  V  ,  E  )       H   V  E     H=(V,E)   is a clutter and    v  ∈  V      v  V    v\in V   , then we may delete  v to get the clutter    H  ∖  v      H  v    H\setminus v   with vertex set    V  ∖   {  v  }       V   v     V\setminus\{v\}   and edge set consisting of all    A  ∈  E      A  E    A\in E   which do not contain v . We contract  v to get the clutter     H  /  v   =   b   (    b   (  H  )    ∖  v   )          H  v     b      b  H   v      H/v=b(b(H)\setminus v)   . These two operations commute, and if J is another clutter, we say that J is a minor of H if a clutter isomorphic to J may be obtained from H by a sequence of deletions and contractions.
