Dolbeault cohomology

In mathematics, in particular in algebraic geometry and differential geometry, Dolbeault cohomology (named after Pierre Dolbeault) is an analog of de Rham cohomology for complex manifolds. Let M be a complex manifold. Then the Dolbeault cohomology groups Hp,q(M,C) depend on a pair of integers p and q and are realized as a subquotient of the space of complex differential forms of degree (p,q).
Construction of the cohomology groups
Let Ωp,q be the vector bundle of complex differential forms of degree (p,q). In the article on complex forms, the Dolbeault operator is defined as a differential operator on smooth sections


 
  Since


 
  this operator has some associated cohomology. Specifically, define the cohomology to be the quotient space



Dolbeault cohomology of vector bundles
If E is a holomorphic vector bundle on a complex manifold X, then one can define likewise a fine resolution of the sheaf 
 
 
 
  of holomorphic sections of E. This is therefore a recollection of the sheaf cohomology of 
 
 
 
 .
Dolbeault's theorem
Dolbeault's theorem is a complex analog1 of de Rham's theorem. It asserts that the Dolbeault cohomology is isomorphic to the sheaf cohomology of the sheaf of holomorphic differential forms. Specifically,


 
  where Ωp is the sheaf of holomorphic p forms on M.
Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  be the fine sheaf of 
 
 
 
  forms of type 
 
 
 
 . Then the 
 
 
 
 -Poincaré lemma says that the sequence



is exact. Like any long exact sequence, this sequence breaks up into short exact sequences. The long exact sequences of cohomology corresponding to these give the result, once one uses that the higher cohomologies of a fine sheaf vanish.

In constrast to De Rham cohomology, Dolbeault cohomology is no longer a topological invariant because it depends closely on complex structure.↩
