   Centered nonagonal number      Centered nonagonal number   (Figure)  Centered nonagonal number.svg   A centered nonagonal number is a centered  figurate number that represents a nonagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in successive nonagonal layers. The centered nonagonal number for n is given by the formula 1        N  c   (  n  )    =     (    3  n   -  2   )    (    3  n   -  1   )    2    .        N  c  n           3  n   2       3  n   1    2     Nc(n)=\frac{(3n-2)(3n-1)}{2}.     Multiplying the ( n - 1)th triangular number by 9 and then adding 1 yields the n th centered nonagonal number, but centered nonagonal numbers have an even simpler relation to triangular numbers: every third triangular number (the 1st, 4th, 7th, etc.) is also a centered nonagonal number. 2  Thus, the first few centered nonagonal numbers are 3   1 , 10 , 28 , 55 , 91 , 136, 190 , 253, 325, 406, 496 , 595, 703, 820, 946.   The list above includes the perfect numbers 28 and 496. All even perfect numbers are triangular numbers whose index is an odd Mersenne prime . 4 Since every Mersenne prime greater than 3 is congruent to 1 modulo 3, it follows that every even perfect number greater than 6 is a centered nonagonal number.  In 1850, Sir Frederick Pollock conjectured that every natural number is the sum of at most eleven centered nonagonal numbers, which has been neither proven nor disproven. 5  See also   Nonagonal number   References  "  Category:Figurate numbers     ↩    . ↩  . ↩
