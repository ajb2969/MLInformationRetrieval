   Slow manifold      Slow manifold   In mathematics , the slow manifold of an equilibrium point of a dynamical system occurs as the most common example of a center manifold . One of the main methods of simplifying dynamical systems , is to reduce the dimension of the system to that of the slow manifold— center manifold theory rigorously justifies the modelling. 1 2 For example, some global and regional models of the atmosphere or oceans resolve the so-called quasi- geostrophic flow dynamics on the slow manifold of the atmosphere/oceanic dynamics, 3 and is thus crucial to forecasting with a climate model .  Definition  Consider the dynamical system        d   x  →     d  t    =    f  →    (   x  →   )            d   normal-→  x      d  t       normal-→  f    normal-→  x      \frac{d{\vec{x}}}{dt}=\vec{f}(\vec{x})     for an evolving state vector     x  →    (  t  )        normal-→  x   t    \vec{x}(t)   and with equilibrium point      x  →   *     superscript   normal-→  x      \vec{x}^{*}   . Then the linearization of the system at the equilibrium point is          d   x  →     d  t    =   A   x  →       where  A   =     d   f  →     d   x  →      (    x  →   *   )      .     formulae-sequence        d   normal-→  x      d  t      A   normal-→  x         where  A         d   normal-→  f      d   normal-→  x      superscript   normal-→  x         \frac{d{\vec{x}}}{dt}=A\vec{x}\quad\text{where }A=\frac{d\vec{f}}{d\vec{x}}(%
 \vec{x}^{*}).     The matrix   A   A   A   defines four invariant subspaces characterized by the eigenvalues    λ   λ   \lambda   of the matrix: as described in the entry for the center manifold three of the subspaces are the stable, unstable and center subspaces corresponding to the span of the eigenvectors with eigenvalues   λ   λ   \lambda   that have real part negative, positive, and zero, respectively; the fourth subspace is the slow subspace given by the span of the eigenvectors, and generalized eigenvectors , corresponding to the eigenvalue    λ  =  0      λ  0    \lambda=0   precisely. The slow subspace is a subspace of the center subspace, or identical to it, or possibly empty.  Correspondingly, the nonlinear system has invariant manifolds , made of trajectories of the nonlinear system, corresponding to each of these invariant subspaces. There is an invariant manifold tangent to the slow subspace and with the same dimension; this manifold is the slow manifold .  Stochastic slow manifolds also exist for noisy dynamical systems ( stochastic differential equation ), as do also stochastic center, stable and unstable manifolds. 4 Such stochastic slow manifolds are similarly useful in modeling emergent stochastic dynamics, but there are many fascinating issues to resolve such as history and future dependent integrals of the noise. 5 6  Examples  Simple case with two variables  The coupled system in two variables    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   and    y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)            d  x    d  t    =    -   x  y    and       d  y    d  t    =     -  y   +   x  2    -   2   y  2         formulae-sequence        d  x     d  t         x  y    and          d  y     d  t          y    superscript  x  2      2   superscript  y  2        \frac{dx}{dt}=-xy\quad\text{ and }\quad\frac{dy}{dt}=-y+x^{2}-2y^{2}     has the exact slow manifold    y  =   x  2       y   superscript  x  2     y=x^{2}   on which the evolution is       d  x   /  d   t   =   -   x  3              d  x   d   t      superscript  x  3      dx/dt=-x^{3}   . Apart from exponentially decaying transients, this slow manifold and its evolution captures all solutions that are in the neighborhood of the origin. 7 The neighborhood of attraction is, roughly, at least the half-space    y  >   -   1  /  2        y      1  2      y>-1/2   .  Slow dynamics among fast waves  Edward Norton Lorenz introduced the following dynamical system of five equations in five variables to explore the notion of a slow manifold of quasi- geostrophic flow 8        d  U    d  t          d  U     d  t     \displaystyle\frac{dU}{dt}   Linearized about the origin the eigenvalue zero has multiplicity three, and there is a complex conjugate pair of eigenvalues,    ±  i     plus-or-minus  i    \pm i   . Hence there exists a three-dimensional slow manifold (surrounded by 'fast' waves in the   X   X   X   and   Z   Z   Z   variables). Lorenz later argued a slow manifold did not exist! 9 But normal form 10 arguments suggest that there is a dynamical system that is exponentially close to the Lorenz system for which there is a good slow manifold.  Eliminate an infinity of variables  In modeling we aim to simplify enormously. This example uses a slow manifold to simplify the 'infinite dimensional' dynamics of a partial differential equation to a model of one ordinary differential equation . Consider a field    u   (  x  ,  t  )       u   x  t     u(x,t)   undergoing the nonlinear diffusion     b   b   b     Parametrising the boundary conditions by    b  =  0      b  0    b=0   empowers us to cover the insulating Neumann boundary condition case    b  =  1      b  1    b=1   , the Dirichlet boundary condition case   b   b   b   , and all cases between.  Now for a marvelous trick, much used in exploring dynamics with bifurcation theory . Since parameter      ∂  b    ∂  t    =  0          b     t    0    \frac{\partial b}{\partial t}=0   is constant, adjoin the trivially true differential equation      (  b  ,   u   (  x  )    )     b    u  x     (b,u(x))     Then in the extended state space of the evolving field and parameter,    b  =  0      b  0    b=0   , there exists an infinity of equilibria, not just one equilibrium, with    u  =       u  absent    u=   (insulating) and    u  =  a      u  a    u=a   constant, say    a  >  0      a  0    a>0   . Without going into details, about each and every equilibria the linearized diffusion has two zero eigenvalues and for    -     π  2   a   /  4            superscript  π  2   a   4     -\pi^{2}a/4   all the rest are negative (less than     u   (  x  ,  t  )    =   a   (  t  )    (   1  -   b   x  2     )          u   x  t      a  t    1    b   superscript  x  2        u(x,t)=a(t)(1-bx^{2})   ). Thus the two-dimensional dynamics on the slow manifolds emerge (see emergence ) from the nonlinear diffusion no matter how complicated the initial conditions.  Here one can straightforwardly verify the slow manifold to be precisely the field   a   a   a   where amplitude       d  a    d  t    =   -   2   a  2   b       and    d  b    d  t     =  0.      formulae-sequence        d  a     d  t        2   superscript  a  2   b         and      d  b     d  t     0.     \frac{da}{dt}=-2a^{2}b\quad\text{and }\frac{db}{dt}=0.   evolves according to     a   a   a     That is, after the initial transients that by diffusion smooth internal structures, the emergent behavior is one of relatively slow decay of the amplitude (   b   b   b   ) at a rate controlled by the type of boundary condition (constant   a   a   a   ).  Notice that this slow manifold model is global in   b   b   b   as each equilibria is necessarily in the slow subspace of each other equilibria, but is only local in parameter   b   b   b   . We cannot yet be sure how large   b   b   b   may be taken, but the theory assures us the results do hold for some finite parameter   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   .  Perhaps the simplest nontrivial stochastic slow manifold  Stochastic modeling is much more complicated—this example illustrates just one such complication. Consider for small parameter    W   (  t  )       W  t    W(t)   the two variable dynamics of this linear system forced with noise from the random walk        d  x   =    ε   y   d  t   and      d  y   =    -    y   d  t    +   d   W       .     formulae-sequence      d  x      ε  y  d  t   and        d  y         y  d  t      d  W       dx=\varepsilon y\,dt\quad\text{and}\quad dy=-y\,dt+dW\,.   :     y   y   y     One could simply notice that the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process     y  =    ∫   -  ∞   t     exp   (   s  -  t   )    d  W   (  s  )         y    superscript   subscript        t         s  t    d  W  s      y=\int_{-\infty}^{t}\exp(s-t)\,dW(s)   is formally the history integral      x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)     and then assert that    exp   (   s  -  t   )         s  t     \exp(s-t)   is simply the integral of this history integral. However, this solution then inappropriately contains fast time integrals, due to the    (   X   (  t  )    ,   Y   (  t  )    )       X  t     Y  t     (X(t),Y(t))   in the integrand, in a supposedly long time model.  Alternatively, a stochastic coordinate transform extracts a sound model for the long term dynamics. Change variables to     y  =    Y  +    ∫   -  ∞   t     exp   (   s  -  t   )    d  W   (  s  )      and     x  =   X  -   ε  Y   -   ε    ∫   -  ∞   t     exp   (   s  -  t   )    d  W   (  s  )           formulae-sequence    y     Y    superscript   subscript        t         s  t    d  W  s     and      x    X    ε  Y     ε    superscript   subscript        t         s  t    d  W  s         y=Y+\int_{-\infty}^{t}\exp(s-t)\,dW(s)\quad\text{and}\quad x=X-\varepsilon Y-%
 \varepsilon\int_{-\infty}^{t}\exp(s-t)\,dW(s)   where         d  X   =     ε   d  W   and      d  Y   =   -    Y   d  t      .     formulae-sequence      d  X      ε  d  W   and        d  Y       Y  d  t       dX=\varepsilon\,dW\quad\text{and}\quad dY=-Y\,dt.     then the new variables evolve according to the simple       Y   (  t  )    →  0     normal-→    Y  t   0    Y(t)\to 0     In these new coordinates we readily deduce     X   (  t  )    =   ϵ  W   (  t  )          X  t     ϵ  W  t     X(t)=\epsilon W(t)   exponentially quickly, leaving    Y  =  0      Y  0    Y=0   undergoing a random walk to be the long term model of the stochastic dynamics on the stochastic slow manifold obtained by setting $Y=0$ .  A web service constructs such slow manifolds in finite dimensions, both deterministic and stochastic. 11  See also   Quasi-geostrophic equations   References  External links  "  Category:Dynamical systems     J.
