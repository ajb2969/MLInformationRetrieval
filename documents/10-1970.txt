   Fucosterol-epoxide lyase      Fucosterol-epoxide lyase   In enzymology , a fucosterol-epoxide lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (24R,24'R)-fucosterol epoxide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   desmosterol + acetaldehyde   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (24R,24'R)-fucosterol epoxide , and two products , desmosterol and acetaldehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (24R,24'R)-fucosterol-epoxide acetaldehyde-lyase (desmosterol-forming) . This enzyme is also called (24R,24'R)-fucosterol-epoxide acetaldehyde-lyase .
