   Nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase      Nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase   In enzymology , a nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + nicotinamide ribonucleotide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + NAD +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and nicotinamide ribonucleotide , whereas its two products are diphosphate and NAD + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:nicotinamide-nucleotide adenylyltransferase . Other names in common use include NAD+ pyrophosphorylase , adenosine triphosphate-nicotinamide mononucleotide transadenylase , ATP:NMN adenylyltransferase , diphosphopyridine nucleotide pyrophosphorylase , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide pyrophosphorylase , nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase , and NMN adenylyltransferase . This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . The human version of this protein is NMNAT1 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 11 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , and .
