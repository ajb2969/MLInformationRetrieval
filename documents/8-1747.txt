   Polynomial matrix      Polynomial matrix   In mathematics , a polynomial matrix or sometimes matrix polynomial is a matrix whose elements are univariate or multivariate polynomials . A λ -matrix is a matrix whose elements are polynomials in λ .  A univariate polynomial matrix P of degree p is defined as:      P  =    ∑   n  =  0   p    A   (  n  )    x  n     =    A   (  0  )    +   A   (  1  )   x   +   A   (  2  )    x  2    +  ⋯  +   A   (  p  )    x  p           P    superscript   subscript     n  0    p     A  n   superscript  x  n              A  0     A  1  x     A  2   superscript  x  2    normal-⋯    A  p   superscript  x  p        P=\sum_{n=0}^{p}A(n)x^{n}=A(0)+A(1)x+A(2)x^{2}+\cdots+A(p)x^{p}     where    A   (  i  )       A  i    A(i)   denotes a matrix of constant coefficients, and    A   (  p  )       A  p    A(p)   is non-zero. Thus a polynomial matrix is the matrix-equivalent of a polynomial, with each element of the matrix satisfying the definition of a polynomial of degree p .  An example 3×3 polynomial matrix, degree 2:       P  =   (     1     x  2     x      0     2  x     2        3  x   +  2       x  2   -  1     0     )   =    (     1    0    0      0    0    2      2     -  1     0     )   +    (     0    0    1      0    2    0      3    0    0     )   x   +    (     0    1    0      0    0    0      0    1    0     )    x  2      .        P    1   superscript  x  2   x    0    2  x   2        3  x   2      superscript  x  2   1   0             1  0  0    0  0  2    2    1   0        0  0  1    0  2  0    3  0  0    x       0  1  0    0  0  0    0  1  0     superscript  x  2        P=\begin{pmatrix}1&x^{2}&x\\
 0&2x&2\\
 3x+2&x^{2}-1&0\end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix}1&0&0\\
 0&0&2\\
 2&-1&0\end{pmatrix}\par
 +\begin{pmatrix}0&0&1\\
 0&2&0\\
 3&0&0\end{pmatrix}x+\begin{pmatrix}0&1&0\\
 0&0&0\\
 0&1&0\end{pmatrix}x^{2}.     We can express this by saying that for a ring  R , the rings     M  n    (   R   [  X  ]    )        subscript  M  n     R   delimited-[]  X      M_{n}(R[X])   and     (    M  n    (  R  )    )    [  X  ]          subscript  M  n   R    delimited-[]  X     (M_{n}(R))[X]   are isomorphic .  Properties   A polynomial matrix over a field with determinant equal to a non-zero element of that field is called unimodular , and has an inverse that is also a polynomial matrix. Note that the only scalar unimodular polynomials are polynomials of degree 0 – nonzero constants, because an inverse of an arbitrary polynomial of higher degree is a rational function.  The roots of a polynomial matrix over the complex numbers are the points in the complex plane where the matrix loses rank .   Note that polynomial matrices are not to be confused with monomial matrices , which are simply matrices with exactly one non-zero entry in each row and column.  If by λ we denote any element of the field over which we constructed the matrix, by I the identity matrix, and we let A be a polynomial matrix, then the matrix λ I − A is the characteristic matrix of the matrix A . Its determinant, |λ I − A | is the characteristic polynomial of the matrix A .
