In differential geometry, constant-mean-curvature (CMC) surfaces are surfaces with constant mean curvature.12 This includes minimal surfaces as a subset, but typically they are treated as special case.
Note that these surfaces are generally different from constant Gaussian curvature surfaces, with the important exception of the sphere.
History
In 1841 Delaunay proved that the only surfaces of revolution with constant mean curvature were the surfaces obtained by rotating the roulettes of the conics. These are the plane, cylinder, sphere, the catenoid, the unduloid and nodoid.3
In 1853 J. H. Jellet showed that if 
 
 
 
  is a compact star-shaped surface in 
 
 
 
  with constant mean curvature, then it is the standard sphere.4 Subsequently A. D. Alexandrov proved that a compact embedded surface in 
 
 
 
  with constant mean curvature 
 
 
 
 
  must be a sphere.5 Based on this H. Hopf conjectured in 1956 that any immersed compact orientable constant mean curvature hypersurface in 
 
 
 
 must be a standard embedded 
 
 
 
  sphere. This conjecture was disproven in 1982 by Wu-Yi Hsiang using a counterexample in 
 
 
 
 . In 1984 Henry C. Wente constructed the Wente torus, an immersion into 
 
 
 
  of a torus with constant mean curvature. 6
Up until this point it had seemed that CMC surfaces were rare; new techniques produced a plethora of examples.7 In particular gluing methods appear to allow combining CMC surfaces fairly arbitrarily.89 Delaunay surfaces can also be combined with immersed "bubbles", retaining their CMC properties.10
Meeks showed that there are no embedded CMC surfaces with just one end in 
 
 
 
 
 .11 Korevaar, Kusner and Solomon proved that a complete embedded CMC surface will have ends asymptotic to unduloids.12 Each end carries a 
 
 
 
  "force" along the asymptotic axis of the unduloid (where n is the circumference of the necks), the sum of which must be balanced for the surface to exist. Current work involves classification of families of embedded CMC surfaces in terms of their moduli spaces.13 In particular, for 
 
 
 
  coplanar k-unduloids of genus 0 satisfy 
 
 
 
  for odd k, and 
 
 
 
  for even k. At most k − 2 ends can be cylindrical.14
Generation methods
Representation formula
Like for minimal surfaces, there exist a close link to harmonic functions. An oriented surface 
 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  has constant mean curvature if and only if its Gauss map is a harmonic function.15 Kenmotsu’s representation formula16 is the counterpart to the Weierstrass–Enneper parameterization of minimal surfaces:
Let 
 
 
 
  be an open simply connected subset of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be an arbitrary non-zero real constant. Suppose 
 
 
 
 
  is a harmonic function into the Riemann sphere. If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  deﬁned by


 
  with



for 
 
 
 
 
  is a regular surface having 
 
 
 
  as Gauss map and mean curvature 
 
 
 
 .
For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  this produces the sphere. 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  gives a cylinder.
Conjugate cousin method
Lawson showed 1970 that each CMC surface in 
 
 
 
 has an isometric "cousin" minimal surface in 
 
 
 
 .1718 This allows constructions starting from geodesic polygons in 
 
 
 
 , which are spanned by a minimal patch that can be extended into a complete surface by reflection, and then turned into a CMC surface.
Discrete numerical methods
Discrete differential geometry can be used to produce approximations to CMC surfaces (or discrete counterparts), typically by minimizing a suitable energy functional.1920
Applications
CMC surfaces are natural for representations of soap bubbles, since they have the curvature corresponding to a nonzero pressure difference.
Besides macroscopic bubble surfaces CMC surfaces are relevant for the shape of the gas–liquid interface on a superhydrophobic surface.21
Like triply periodic minimal surfaces there has been interest in periodic CMC surfaces as models for block copolymers where the different components have a nonzero interfacial energy or tension. CMC analogs to the periodic minimal surfaces have been constructed, producing unequal partitions of space.2223 CMC structures have been observed in ABC triblock copolymers.24
In architecture CMC surfaces are relevant for air-supported structures such as inflatable domes and enclosures, as well as a source of flowing organic shapes.25
