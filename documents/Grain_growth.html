<h1>Grain growth</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Grain growth</strong> is the increase in size of grains (<a href="crystallite" title="wikilink">crystallites</a>) in a material at high temperature. This occurs when <a href="Recovery_(metallurgy)" title="wikilink">recovery</a> and <a href="Recrystallization_(metallurgy)" title="wikilink">recrystallisation</a> are complete and further reduction in the internal energy can only be achieved by reducing the total area of grain boundary. The term is commonly used in metallurgy but is also used in reference to ceramics and minerals.</p>
<h2 id="importance-of-grain-growth">Importance of grain growth</h2>

<p>Most materials exhibit the <a class="uri" href="Hall–Petch" title="wikilink">Hall–Petch</a> effect at room-temperature and so display a higher <a href="yield_stress" title="wikilink">yield stress</a> when the grain size is reduced. At high temperatures the opposite is true since the open, disordered nature of grain boundaries means that <a href="vacancy_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">vacancies</a> can diffuse more rapidly down boundaries leading to more rapid <a href="Coble_creep" title="wikilink">Coble creep</a>. Since boundaries are regions of high energy they make excellent sites for the nucleation of precipitates and other second-phases e.g. Mg–Si–Cu phases in some aluminium alloys or <a class="uri" href="martensite" title="wikilink">martensite</a> platlets in steel. Depending on the second phase in question this may have positive or negative effects.</p>
<h2 id="rules-of-grain-growth">Rules of grain growth</h2>

<p>Grain growth has long been studied primarily by the examination of sectioned, polished and <a href="Industrial_etching" title="wikilink">etched</a> samples under the optical <a class="uri" href="microscope" title="wikilink">microscope</a>. Although such methods enabled the collection of a great deal of empirical evidence, particularly with regard to factors such as <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a> or <a href="Alloy" title="wikilink">composition</a>, the lack of crystallographic information limited the development of an understanding of the fundamental <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>. Nevertheless, the following became well-established features of grain growth:</p>
<ol>
<li>Grain growth occurs by the movement of grain boundaries and not by coalescence (i.e. like water droplets)</li>
<li>Boundary movement is discontinuous and the direction of motion may change suddenly.</li>
<li>One grain may grow into another grain whilst being consumed from the other side</li>
<li>The rate of consumption often increases when the grain is nearly consumed</li>
<li>A curved boundary typically migrates towards its centre of curvature</li>
<li>When grain boundaries in a single phase meet at angles other than 120 degrees, the grain included by the more acute angle will be consumed so that the angles approach 120 degrees.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="driving-force">Driving force</h2>

<p>The boundary between one grain and its neighbour (<a href="grain_boundary" title="wikilink">grain boundary</a>) is a defect in the crystal structure and so it is associated with a certain amount of energy. As a result, there is a thermodynamic driving force for the total area of boundary to be reduced. If the grain size increases, accompanied by a reduction in the actual number of grains per volume, then the total area of grain boundary will be reduced.</p>

<p>The local velocity of a grain boundary at any point is proportional to the local curvature of the grain boundary, i.e.:</p>

<p>In comparison to phase transformations the energy available to drive grain growth is very low and so it tends to occur at much slower rates and is easily slowed by the presence of second phase particles or solute atoms in the structure.</p>

Click to see the animation. Ideal grain growth is a special case of normal grain growth where boundary motion is driven only by local curvature of the grain boundary. It results in the reduction of the total amount of grain boundary surface area i.e. total energy of the system. Additional contributions to the driving force by e.g. elastic strains or temperature gradients are neglected. If it holds that the rate of growth is proportional to the driving force and that the driving force is proportional to the total amount of grain boundary energy, then it can be shown that the time <em>t</em> required to reach a given grain size is approximated by the equation</p>

<p>where <em>k<sub>0</sub></em> is a constant, <em>T</em> is the absolute temperature and <em>Q</em> is the activation energy for boundary mobility. Theoretically, the activation energy for boundary mobility should equal that for self-diffusion but this is often found not to be the case.</p>

<p>In general these equations are found to hold for ultra-high purity materials but rapidly fail when even tiny concentrations of solute are introduced.</p>
<h2 id="normal-vs-abnormal">Normal vs abnormal</h2>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Distinction between continuous (normal) grain growth, where all grains grow at roughly the same rate, and <a href="Abnormal_grain_growth" title="wikilink">discontinuous (abnormal) grain growth</a>, where one grain grows at a much greater rate than its neighbours.</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>In common with <a href="Recovery_(metallurgy)" title="wikilink">recovery</a> and <a href="Recrystallization_(metallurgy)" title="wikilink">recrystallisation</a>, growth phenomena can be separated into continuous and discontinuous mechanisms. In the former the microstructure evolves from state A to B (in this case the grains get larger) in a uniform manner. In the latter, the changes occur heterogeneously and specific transformed and untransformed regions may be identified. Abnormal or <a href="Abnormal_grain_growth" title="wikilink">discontinuous grain growth</a> is characterised by a subset of grains growing at a high rate and at the expense of their neighbours and tends to result in a microstructure dominated by a few very large grains. In order for this to occur the subset of grains must possess some advantage over their competitors such as a high grain boundary energy, locally high grain boundary mobility, favourable texture or lower local second-phase particle density.</p>
<h2 id="factors-hindering-growth">Factors hindering growth</h2>

<p>If there are additional factors preventing boundary movement, such as <a href="Zener_pinning" title="wikilink">Zener pinning</a> by particles, then the grain size may be restricted to a much lower value than might otherwise be expected. This is an important industrial mechanism in preventing the softening of materials at high temperature.</p>
<h2 id="inhibition">Inhibition</h2>

<p>Certain materials especially <a class="uri" href="refractories" title="wikilink">refractories</a> which are processed at high temperatures end up with excessively large grain size and poor mechanical properties at room temperature. To mitigate this problem in a common <a class="uri" href="sintering" title="wikilink">sintering</a> procedure, a variety of <a class="uri" href="dopants" title="wikilink">dopants</a> are often used to inhibit grain growth.</p>
