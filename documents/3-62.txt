   Newman–Shanks–Williams prime      Newman–Shanks–Williams prime   In mathematics , a Newman–Shanks–Williams prime (NSW prime) is a prime number  p which can be written in the form        S    2  m   +  1    =      (   1  +   2    )     2  m   +  1    +    (   1  -   2    )     2  m   +  1     2    .       subscript  S      2  m   1         superscript    1    2        2  m   1     superscript    1    2        2  m   1     2     S_{2m+1}=\frac{\left(1+\sqrt{2}\right)^{2m+1}+\left(1-\sqrt{2}\right)^{2m+1}}{%
 2}.     NSW primes were first described by Morris Newman , Daniel Shanks and Hugh C. Williams in 1981 during the study of finite simple groups with square order.  The first few NSW primes are 7 , 41 , 239 , 9369319, 63018038201, … , corresponding to the indices 3, 5, 7, 19, 29, … .  The sequence  S alluded to in the formula can be described by the following recurrence relation :       S  0   =   1        subscript  S  0   1    S_{0}=1\,          S  1   =   1        subscript  S  1   1    S_{1}=1\,           S  n   =    2   S   n  -  1     +   S   n  -  2        for all  n   ≥  2.      formulae-sequence     subscript  S  n       2   subscript  S    n  1      subscript  S    n  2          for all  n   2.     S_{n}=2S_{n-1}+S_{n-2}\qquad\text{for all }n\geq 2.   The first few terms of the sequence are 1, 1, 3, 7, 17, 41, 99, … . Each term in this sequence is half the corresponding term in the sequence of companion Pell numbers . These numbers also appear in the continued fraction convergents to √2.
