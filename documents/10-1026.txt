   Albendazole monooxygenase      Albendazole monooxygenase   In enzymology , an albendazole monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   albendazole + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   albendazole S-oxide + NADP + + H 2 O   The four substrates of this enzyme are albendazole , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its three products are albendazole S-oxide , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is albendazole,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (sulfoxide-forming) . Other names in common use include albendazole oxidase , and albendazole sulfoxidase . It employs one cofactor , FAD .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.13  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
