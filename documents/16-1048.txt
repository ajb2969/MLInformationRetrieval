Pulse vaccination strategy

 Pulse vaccination strategy is a method used to eradicate an epidemic by repeatedly vaccinating a group at risk, over a defined age range until the spread of the pathogen has been stopped. It is most commonly used during measles and polio epidemics to quickly stop the spread and contain the outbreak.12
Where T= time units is a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects vaccinated in a relatively short time. This yields the differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects as:






It is easy to see that by setting 
 
 
 
  one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:



and that the eradication condition is:
