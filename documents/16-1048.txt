   Pulse vaccination strategy      Pulse vaccination strategy    Pulse vaccination strategy is a method used to eradicate an epidemic by repeatedly vaccinating a group at risk, over a defined age range until the spread of the pathogen has been stopped. It is most commonly used during measles and polio epidemics to quickly stop the spread and contain the outbreak. 1 2  Where T= time units is a constant fraction p of susceptible subjects vaccinated in a relatively short time. This yields the differential equations for the susceptible and vaccinated subjects as:          d  S    d  t    =    μ  N   -   μ  S   -   β   I  N   S     ,    S   (   n   T  +    )    =    (   1  -  p   )   S   (   n   T  -    )   n   =  0    ,   1  ,  2  ,  …      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence        d  S     d  t        μ  N     μ  S     β    I  N   S           S    n   superscript  T          1  p   S    n   superscript  T     n        0      1  2  normal-…     \frac{dS}{dt}=\mu N-\mu S-\beta\frac{I}{N}S,S(nT^{+})=(1-p)S(nT^{-})n=0,1,2,\dots             d  V    d  t    =   -   μ  V     ,    V   (   n   T  +    )    =    V   (   n   T  -    )    +   p  S   (   n   T  -    )   n    =  0    ,   1  ,  2  ,  …      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence        d  V     d  t        μ  V           V    n   superscript  T          V    n   superscript  T        p  S    n   superscript  T     n         0      1  2  normal-…     \frac{dV}{dt}=-\mu V,V(nT^{+})=V(nT^{-})+pS(nT^{-})n=0,1,2,\dots     It is easy to see that by setting    I  =  0      I  0    I=0   one obtains that the dynamics of the susceptible subjects is given by:        S  *    (  t  )    =   1  -    p   1  -    (   1  -  p   )    E   -   μ  T         E   -   μ  M  O  D   (  t  ,  T  )               superscript  S    t     1      p    1      1  p    superscript  E      μ  T         superscript  E      μ  M  O  D   t  T          S^{*}(t)=1-\frac{p}{1-(1-p)E^{-\mu T}}E^{-\mu MOD(t,T)}     and that the eradication condition is:        R  0     ∫  0  T     S  *    (  t  )   d  t     <  1         subscript  R  0     superscript   subscript   0   T      superscript  S    t  d  t     1    R_{0}\int_{0}^{T}{S^{*}(t)dt}<1     See also   Critical community size  Epidemic model  Pulse Polio  Vaccine-naive  Herd immunity  Ring vaccination   References  External links   Immunisation Immunisation schedule for children in the UK.
