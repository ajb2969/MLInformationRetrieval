The name Popt√≠ for the language is used by the Academia de Lenguas Mayas de Guatemala and the Guatemalan Congress .

In both languages, the n-trema represents a velar nasal consonant  (like "ng" in "bang").  Jakaltek-language programming is carried by the CDI 's radio station XEVFS , broadcasting from Las Margaritas, Chiapas .  Grammar  The Jacaltec language has a verb‚Äìsubject‚Äìobject syntax. Like many Native American languages, Jacaltec has complex agglutinative  morphology and uses ergative‚Äìabsolutive case alignment . It is divided in two dialects, Eastern and Western Jakalteko. "Eastern and Western Jakalteko understand each other's spoken languages, but not written text." 2  Owing to Jacaltec's dissimilarity with Indo-European languages , the reasonably healthy linguistic population and the relative ease of access to Guatemala, Jacaltec has become a favorite of students of linguistic typology .
