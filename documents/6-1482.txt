   Ergodic sequence      Ergodic sequence   In mathematics , an ergodic sequence is a certain type of integer sequence , having certain equidistribution properties.  Definition  Let    A  =   {   a  j   }       A    subscript  a  j      A=\{a_{j}\}   be an infinite, strictly increasing sequence of positive integers. Then, given an integer q , this sequence is said to be '''ergodic mod q ''' if, for all integers    1  ≤  k  ≤  q        1  k       q     1\leq k\leq q   , one has        lim   t  →  ∞      N   (  A  ,  t  ,  k  ,  q  )     N   (  A  ,  t  )      =   1  q         subscript    normal-→  t         N   A  t  k  q      N   A  t        1  q     \lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{N(A,t,k,q)}{N(A,t)}=\frac{1}{q}     where       N   (  A  ,  t  )    =   card   {    a  j   ∈  A   :    a  j   ≤  t   }          N   A  t      card   conditional-set     subscript  a  j   A      subscript  a  j   t       N(A,t)=\mbox{card}\{a_{j}\in A:a_{j}\leq t\}     and card is the count (the number of elements) of a set, so that    N   (  A  ,  t  )       N   A  t     N(A,t)   is the number of elements in the sequence A that are less than or equal to t , and       N   (  A  ,  t  ,  k  ,  q  )    =   card   {    a  j   ∈  A   :     a  j   ≤  t   ,     a  j   mod  q   =  k    }          N   A  t  k  q      card   conditional-set     subscript  a  j   A    formulae-sequence     subscript  a  j   t      modulo   subscript  a  j   q   k        N(A,t,k,q)=\mbox{card}\{a_{j}\in A:a_{j}\leq t,\,a_{j}\mod q=k\}     so    N   (  A  ,  t  ,  k  ,  q  )       N   A  t  k  q     N(A,t,k,q)   is the number of elements in the sequence A , less than t , that are equivalent to k modulo q . That is, a sequence is an ergodic sequence if it becomes uniformly distributed mod q as the sequence is taken to infinity.  An equivalent definition is that the sum        lim   t  →  ∞      1   N   (  A  ,  t  )       ∑    j  ;   a  j    ≤  t     exp    2  π  i  k   a  j    q       =  0        subscript    normal-→  t         1    N   A  t       subscript      j   subscript  a  j    t          2  π  i  k   subscript  a  j    q       0    \lim_{t\to\infty}\frac{1}{N(A,t)}\sum_{j;a_{j}\leq t}\exp\frac{2\pi ika_{j}}{q%
 }=0     vanish for every integer k with     k  mod  q   ≠  0       modulo  k  q   0    k\mod q\neq 0   .  If a sequence is ergodic for all q , then it is sometimes said to be ergodic for periodic systems .  Examples  The sequence of positive integers is ergodic for all q .  Almost all  Bernoulli sequences , that is, sequences associated with a Bernoulli process , are ergodic for all q . That is, let    (  Ω  ,   P  r   )     normal-Ω    P  r     (\Omega,Pr)   be a probability space of random variables over two letters    {  0  ,  1  }     0  1    \{0,1\}   . Then, given    ω  ∈  Ω      ω  normal-Ω    \omega\in\Omega   , the random variable     X  j    (  ω  )        subscript  X  j   ω    X_{j}(\omega)   is 1 with some probability p and is zero with some probability 1- p ; this is the definition of a Bernoulli process. Associated with each   ω   ω   \omega   is the sequence of integers       ℤ  ω   =   {   n  ∈  ℤ   :     X  n    (  ω  )    =  1   }        superscript  ℤ  ω    conditional-set    n  ℤ        subscript  X  n   ω   1      \mathbb{Z}^{\omega}=\{n\in\mathbb{Z}:X_{n}(\omega)=1\}     Then almost every sequence    ℤ  ω     superscript  ℤ  ω    \mathbb{Z}^{\omega}   is ergodic.
