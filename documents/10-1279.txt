Cinnamoyl-CoA reductase

In enzymology, a cinnamoyl-CoA reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

cinnamaldehyde + CoA + NADP+

 
  cinnamoyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are cinnamaldehyde, CoA, and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are cinnamoyl-CoA, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cinnamaldehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-cinnamoylating). Other names in common use include feruloyl-CoA reductase, cinnamoyl-coenzyme A reductase, ferulyl-CoA reductase, feruloyl coenzyme A reductase, p-hydroxycinnamoyl coenzyme A reductase, and cinnamoyl-CoA:NADPH reductase. This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.
