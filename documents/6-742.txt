   Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem      Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem   In econometrics , the Frisch–Waugh–Lovell (FWL) theorem is named after the econometricians Ragnar Frisch , Frederick V. Waugh , and Michael C. Lovell.  The Frisch–Waugh–Lovell theorem states that if the regression we are concerned with is:      Y  =     X  1    β  1    +    X  2    β  2    +   u        Y       subscript  X  1    subscript  β  1       subscript  X  2    subscript  β  2    u     Y=X_{1}\beta_{1}+X_{2}\beta_{2}+u\!     where    X  1     subscript  X  1    X_{1}   and    X  2     subscript  X  2    X_{2}   are    n  ×   k  1       n   subscript  k  1     n\times k_{1}   and    n  ×   k  2       n   subscript  k  2     n\times k_{2}   respectively and where    β  1     subscript  β  1    \beta_{1}   and    β  2     subscript  β  2    \beta_{2}   are conformable , then the estimate of    β  2     subscript  β  2    \beta_{2}   will be the same as the estimate of it from a modified regression of the form:         M   X  1    Y   =     M   X  1     X  2    β  2    +    M   X  1     u      ,         subscript  M   subscript  X  1    Y        subscript  M   subscript  X  1     subscript  X  2    subscript  β  2       subscript  M   subscript  X  1    u      M_{X_{1}}Y=M_{X_{1}}X_{2}\beta_{2}+M_{X_{1}}u\!,     where    M   X  1      subscript  M   subscript  X  1     M_{X_{1}}   projects onto the orthogonal complement of the image of the projection matrix      X  1     (    X  1  ′    X  1    )    -  1     X  1  ′        subscript  X  1    superscript     superscript   subscript  X  1   normal-′    subscript  X  1      1     superscript   subscript  X  1   normal-′     X_{1}(X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1})^{-1}X_{1}^{\prime}   . Equivalently, M X 1 projects onto the orthogonal complement of the column space of X 1 . Specifically,        M   X  1    =   I  -    X  1     (    X  1  ′    X  1    )    -  1     X  1  ′      .       subscript  M   subscript  X  1      I     subscript  X  1    superscript     superscript   subscript  X  1   normal-′    subscript  X  1      1     superscript   subscript  X  1   normal-′       M_{X_{1}}=I-X_{1}(X_{1}^{\prime}X_{1})^{-1}X_{1}^{\prime}.\!     This result implies that all these secondary regressions are unnecessary: using projection matrices to make the explanatory variables orthogonal to each other will lead to the same results as running the regression with all non-orthogonal explanators included.
