Iribarren number

In fluid dynamics, the Iribarren number or Iribarren parameter – also known as the surf similarity parameter and breaker parameter – is a dimensionless parameter used to model several effects of (breaking) surface gravity waves on beaches and coastal structures. The parameter is named after the Spanish engineer Ramón Iribarren Cavanillas (1900–1967),1 who introduced it to describe the occurrence of wave breaking on sloping beaches.2
For instance, the Iribarren number is used to describe breaking wave types on beaches; or wave run-up on – and reflection by – beaches, breakwaters and dikes.345
Definition
The Iribarren number – often denoted as Ir or ξ – is defined as:6


 
   with  
 
 

where ξ is the Iribarren number, α is the bed slope, H is the wave height, L0 is the deep-water wavelength, T is the period and g is the gravitational acceleration. Depending on the application, different definitions of H and T are used, for example: for periodic waves the wave height H0 at deep water or the breaking wave height Hb at the edge of the surf zone. Or, for random waves, the significant wave height Hs at a certain location.
Breaker types
 
The type of breaking wave – spilling, plunging, collapsing or surging – depends on the Iribarren number. According to , for periodic waves propagating on a plane beach, two possible choices for the Iribarren number are:


 
   or  
 
 

where H0 is the offshore wave height in deep water, and Hb is the value of the wave height at the break point (where the waves start to break). Then the breaker types dependence on the Iribarren number (either ξ0 or ξb) is approximately:7




breaker type

ξ0–range

ξb–range





surging or collapsing

ξ0 > 3.3

ξb > 2.0



plunging

0.5 0 < 3.3

0.4 b < 2.0



spilling

ξ0 < 0.5

ξb < 0.4
