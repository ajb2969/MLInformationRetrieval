   Iribarren number      Iribarren number   In fluid dynamics , the Iribarren number or Iribarren parameter – also known as the surf similarity parameter and breaker parameter – is a dimensionless parameter used to model several effects of (breaking) surface gravity waves on beaches and coastal structures. The parameter is named after the Spanish engineer Ramón Iribarren Cavanillas (1900–1967), 1 who introduced it to describe the occurrence of wave breaking on sloping beaches. 2  For instance, the Iribarren number is used to describe breaking wave types on beaches; or wave run-up on – and reflection by – beaches, breakwaters and dikes . 3 4 5  Definition  The Iribarren number – often denoted as Ir or ξ – is defined as: 6       ξ  =    tan  α     H  /   L  0       ,      ξ      α       H   subscript  L  0        \xi=\frac{\tan\alpha}{\sqrt{H/L_{0}}},   with      L  0   =     g   2  π      T  2     ,       subscript  L  0       g    2  π     superscript  T  2      L_{0}=\frac{g}{2\pi}\,T^{2},     where ξ is the Iribarren number, α is the bed slope, H is the wave height , L 0 is the deep-water wavelength , T is the period and g is the gravitational acceleration . Depending on the application, different definitions of H and T are used, for example: for periodic waves the wave height H 0 at deep water or the breaking wave height H b at the edge of the surf zone . Or, for random waves, the significant wave height  H s at a certain location.  Breaker types    The type of breaking wave – spilling, plunging, collapsing or surging – depends on the Iribarren number. According to , for periodic waves propagating on a plane beach, two possible choices for the Iribarren number are:       ξ  0   =    tan  α      H  0   /   L  0           subscript  ξ  0       α        subscript  H  0    subscript  L  0        \xi_{0}=\frac{\tan\alpha}{\sqrt{H_{0}/L_{0}}}   or      ξ  b   =    tan  α      H  b   /   L  0       ,       subscript  ξ  b       α        subscript  H  b    subscript  L  0        \xi_{b}=\frac{\tan\alpha}{\sqrt{H_{b}/L_{0}}},     where H 0 is the offshore wave height in deep water , and H b is the value of the wave height at the break point (where the waves start to break). Then the breaker types dependence on the Iribarren number (either ξ 0 or ξ b ) is approximately: 7      breaker type   ξ 0 –range   ξ b –range       surging or collapsing   ξ 0 > 3.3   ξ b > 2.0     plunging   0.5 0 < 3.3   0.4 b < 2.0     spilling   ξ 0 < 0.5   ξ b < 0.4     References  Footnotes  Other       {{ Citation   | last1 = Iribarren | first1 = C.R. | last2 = Norales | first2 = C. | contribution = Protection des ports | year = 1949 | title = Proceedings XVIIth International Navigation Congress, Section II, Communication | location = Lisbon | volume = 4 | pages = 31–80 }}  "  Category:Water waves  Category:Dimensionless numbers of fluid mechanics  Category:Coastal engineering     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
