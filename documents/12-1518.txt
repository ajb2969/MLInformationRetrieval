   Pseudoreflection      Pseudoreflection   In mathematics , a pseudoreflection is an invertible linear transformation of a finite-dimensional vector space such that it is not the identity transformation , has a finite (multiplicative) order , and fixes a hyperplane . The concept of pseudoreflection generalizes the concepts of reflection and complex reflection , and simply called reflection by some mathematicians. It plays an important role in Invariant theory of finite groups , including the Chevalley-Shephard-Todd theorem . 1  Formal Definition  Suppose that V is vector space over a field K , whose dimension is a finite number n . A pseudoreflection is an invertible linear transformation     g  :   V  →  V      normal-:  g   normal-→  V  V     g:V\to V   such that the order of g is finite and the fixed subspace      V  g   =   {   v  ∈  V   :    g  v   =  v   }        superscript  V  g    conditional-set    v  V       g  v   v      V^{g}=\{v\in V:\ gv=v\}   of all vectors in V fixed by g has dimension n-1 .  Eigenvalues  A pseudoreflection g has an eigenvalue 1 of multiplicity n-1 and another eigenvalue r of multiplicity 1. Since g has finite order, the eigenvalue r must be a root of unity in the field K . It is possible that r = 1 (see Transvections ).  Diagonalizable pseudoreflections  Let p be the characteristic of the field K . If the order of g is coprime to p then g is diagonalizable and represented by a diagonal matrix  diag(1, ... , 1, r ) =    [     1    0    0    ⋯    0      0    1    0    ⋯    0      ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮      0    0    ⋯    1    0      0    0    0    ⋯    r     ]      1  0  0  normal-⋯  0    0  1  0  normal-⋯  0    normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮    0  0  normal-⋯  1  0    0  0  0  normal-⋯  r     \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&\cdots&0\\
 0&1&0&\cdots&0\\
 \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots\\
 0&0&\cdots&1&0\\
 0&0&0&\cdots&r\\
 \end{bmatrix}     where r is a root of unity not equal to 1. This includes the case when K is a field of characteristic zero, such as the field of real numbers and the field of complex numbers.  A diagonalizable pseudoreflection is sometimes called a semisimple reflection .  Real reflections  When K is the field of real numbers, a pseudoreflection has matrix form diag(1, ... , 1, -1). A pseudoreflection with such matrix form is called a real reflection . If the space on which this transformation acts has a symmetric bilinear form defined on it, so that vectors can be orthogonal , then the transformation is a true reflection .  Complex reflections  When K is the field of complex numbers, a pseudoreflection is called a complex reflection , which can be represented by a diagonal matrix diag(1, ... , 1, r) where r is a complex root of unity unequal to 1.  Transvections  If the pseudoreflection g is not diagonalizable then r = 1 and g has Jordan normal form      [     1    0    0    ⋯    0      0    1    0    ⋯    0      ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮    ⋮      0    0    ⋯    1    1      0    0    0    ⋯    1     ]      1  0  0  normal-⋯  0    0  1  0  normal-⋯  0    normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮  normal-⋮    0  0  normal-⋯  1  1    0  0  0  normal-⋯  1     \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&\cdots&0\\
 0&1&0&\cdots&0\\
 \vdots&\vdots&\ddots&\vdots&\vdots\\
 0&0&\cdots&1&1\\
 0&0&0&\cdots&1\\
 \end{bmatrix}     In such case g is called a transvection . A pseudoreflection g is a transvection if and only if the characteristic p of the field K is positive and the order of g is p . Transvections are useful in the study of finite geometries and the classification of their groups of motions. 2  References  "  Category:Functions and mappings     ↩   (Reprint of the 1957 original; A Wiley-Interscience Publication) ↩
