Generalized Clifford algebra

In mathematics, a Generalized Clifford algebra (GCA) is an associative algebra that generalizes the Clifford algebra, and goes back to the work of Hermann Weyl,1 who utilized and formalized these clock-and-shift operators introduced by  J. J. Sylvester (1882),2 and organized by  Cartan (1898)3 and Schwinger.4
Clock and shift matrices find routine applications in numerous areas of mathematical physics, providing the cornerstone of quantum mechanical dynamics in finite-dimensional vector spaces.567 The concept of a spinor can further be linked to these algebras.8
The term Generalized Clifford Algebras can also refer to associative algebras that are constructed using forms of higher degree instead of quadratic forms.9101112
Definition and properties
Abstract definition
The 
 
 
 
 -dimensional generalized Clifford algebra is defined as an associative algebra over a field 
 
 
 
 , generated by13








 
  and



 
 .
Moreover, in any irreducible matrix representation, relevant for physical applications, it is required that



 
 ,   and 
 
 
gcd

 
 . The field 
 
 
 
  is usually taken to be the complex numbers C.
More specific definition

In the more common cases of GCA,14 the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional generalized Clifford algebra of order 
 
 
 
  has the property  ω}}, 
 
 
 
    for all j,k, and 
 
 
 
 . It follows that





 
  and


 
  for all j,k,l = 1,...,n, and


 
  is the 
 
 
 
 th root of 1.
There exist several definitions of a Generalized Clifford Algebra in the literature.15

Clifford algebra

In the (orthogonal) Clifford algebra, the elements follow an anticommutation rule, with 
 
 
 
 .
Matrix representation
The Clock and Shift matrices can be represented16 by 
 
 
 
  matrices in Schwinger's canonical notation as


 
  ,    
 
 
 
  ,    
 
 
 
  .
Notably,  1}}, 
 
 
 
 
  (the Weyl braiding relations), and  U}} (the Discrete Fourier transform). With  V , e2 {{=}} VU, and e3 {{=}} U}}, one has three basis elements which, together with 
 
 
 
 , fulfil the above conditions of the Generalized Clifford Algebra (GCA).
These matrices, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , normally referred to as "shift and clock matrices", were introduced by J. J. Sylvester in the 1880s. (Note that the matrices 
 
 
 
  are cyclic permutation matrices that perform a circular shift; they are not to be confused with upper and lower shift matrices which have ones only either above or below the diagonal, respectively).
Specific examples

Case 
 
 
 
 
 .

In this case, we have 
 
 
 
  = −1, and


 
  ,

  thus


 
  ,    
 
 
 
 
  ,    
 
 
 
  , which constitute the Pauli matrices.

Case 
 
 
 
 ,

In this case we have

  ,    
 
 
 
  and  may be determined accordingly.
