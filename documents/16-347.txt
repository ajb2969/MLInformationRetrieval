   Integer-valued function      Integer-valued function   In mathematics, an integer-valued function is a function whose values are integers . In other words, it is a function that assigns an integer to each member of its domain .  Floor and ceiling functions are examples of an integer-valued function of a real variable , but on real numbers and generally, on (non-disconnected) topological spaces integer-valued functions are not especially useful. Any such function on a connected space either has discontinuities or is constant . On the other hand, on discrete and other totally disconnected spaces integer-valued functions have roughly the same importance as real-valued functions have on non-discrete spaces.  Any function with natural , or non-negative integer values is a partial case of integer-valued function.  Examples  Integer-valued functions defined on the domain of all real numbers include the floor and ceiling functions, the Dirichlet function , the sign function and the Heaviside step function (except possibly at 0).  Integer-valued functions defined on the domain of non-negative real numbers include the integer square root function and the prime-counting function .  Algebraic properties  On an arbitrary set    X   X   X   , integer-valued functions form a ring with pointwise operations of addition and multiplication , and also an algebra over the ring   ùêô   ùêô   \mathbf{Z}   of integers. Since the latter is an ordered ring , the functions form a partially ordered ring :        f  ‚â§   g  ‚áî   ‚àÄ  x     :    f   (  x  )    ‚â§   g   (  x  )      .     normal-:    f   g  iff   for-all  x         f  x     g  x      f\leq g\quad\iff\quad\forall x:f(x)\leq g(x).     Uses  Graph theory and algebra  Integer-valued functions are ubiquitous in graph theory . They also have similar uses in geometric group theory , where length function represents the concept of norm , and word metric represents the concept of metric .  Integer-valued polynomials are important in ring theory .  Mathematical logic and computability theory  In mathematical logic such concepts as a primitive recursive function and a Œº-recursive function represent integer-valued functions of several natural variables or, in other words, functions on . G√∂del numbering , defined on well-formed formulae of some formal language , is a natural-valued function.  Computability theory is essentially based on natural numbers and natural (or integer) functions on them.  Number theory  In number theory , many arithmetic functions are integer-valued.  Computer science  In computer programming many functions return values of integer type due to simplicity of implementation.
