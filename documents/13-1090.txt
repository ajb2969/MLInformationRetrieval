Transfinite interpolation

In numerical analysis, transfinite interpolation is a means to construct functions over a planar domain in such a way that they match a given function on the boundary. This method is applied in geometric modelling and in the field of finite element method.
The transfinite interpolation method, first introduced by William J. Gordon and Charles A. Hall,1 receives its name due to how a function belonging to this class is able to match the primitive function at a nondenumerable number of points.2 In the authors' words: 
Formula
With parametrized curves 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  describing one pair of opposite sides of a domain, and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  describing the other pair. the position of point (u,v) in the domain is



where, e.g., 
 
 
 
  is the point where curves 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  meet.
