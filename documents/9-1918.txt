Kavrayskiy VII projection

 
The Kavrayskiy VII projection is a map projection invented by Vladimir V. Kavrayskiy in 19391 for use as a general purpose pseudocylindrical projection. Like the Robinson projection, it is a compromise intended to produce good quality maps with low distortion overall. It scores well in that respect compared to other popular projections, such as the Winkel Tripel,23 despite straight, evenly spaced parallels and a simple formulation.
The projection is defined as:






where 
 
 
 
  is the longitude and 
 
 
 
 
  is the latitude in radians.
