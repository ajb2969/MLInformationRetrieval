   Kavrayskiy VII projection      Kavrayskiy VII projection     The Kavrayskiy VII projection is a map projection invented by Vladimir V. Kavrayskiy in 1939 1 for use as a general purpose pseudocylindrical projection. Like the Robinson projection , it is a compromise intended to produce good quality maps with low distortion overall. It scores well in that respect compared to other popular projections, such as the Winkel Tripel , 2 3 despite straight, evenly spaced parallels and a simple formulation.  The projection is defined as:      x  =     3  λ   2      1  3   -    (   ϕ  π   )   2          x        3  λ   2         1  3    superscript    ϕ  π   2        x=\frac{3\lambda}{2}\sqrt{\frac{1}{3}-\left(\frac{\phi}{\pi}\right)^{2}}         y  =   ϕ       y  ϕ    y=\phi\,     where   λ   λ   \lambda   is the longitude and   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the latitude in radians.
