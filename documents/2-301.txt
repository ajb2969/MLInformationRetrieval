Chain complex

In mathematics, chain complex and cochain complex are constructs originally used in the field of algebraic topology. They are algebraic means of representing the relationships between the cycles and boundaries in various dimensions of a topological space. More generally, homological algebra includes the study of chain complexes in the abstract, without any reference to an underlying space. In this case, chain complexes are studied axiomatically as algebraic structures.
Applications of chain complexes usually define and apply their homology groups (cohomology groups for cochain complexes); in more abstract settings various equivalence relations are applied to complexes (for example starting with the chain homotopy idea). Chain complexes are easily defined in abelian categories, also.
Formal definition
A chain complex

 
  is a sequence of abelian groups or modules ... A2, A1, A0, A-1, A-2, ... connected by homomorphisms (called boundary operators) dn : An→An−1, such that the composition of any two consecutive maps is zero: dn ∘ dn+1 = 0 for all n. They are usually written out as:






A_{n+1} \xrightarrow{d_{n+1}} A_n \xrightarrow{d_n} A_{n-1} \xrightarrow{d_{n-1}} A_{n-2} \to
\cdots  \xrightarrow{d_2} A_1 \xrightarrow{d_1}
A_0 \xrightarrow{d_0} A_{-1} \xrightarrow{d_{-1}} A_{-2} \xrightarrow{d_{-2}} \cdots 
A variant on the concept of chain complex is that of cochain complex. A cochain complex

 
  is a sequence of abelian groups or modules ..., 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , ... connected by homomorphisms

 
  such that the composition of any two consecutive maps is zero
 
 
 
  for all n:






\cdots \to A^{-2} \xrightarrow{d^{-2}} A^{-1} \xrightarrow{d^{-1}} A^0 \xrightarrow{d^0} A^1 \xrightarrow{d^1} A^2 \to \cdots \to A^{n-1} \xrightarrow{d^{n-1}} A^n \xrightarrow{d^n} A^{n+1} \to \cdots.
The index 
 
 
 
  in either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is referred to as the degree (or dimension). The only difference in the definitions of chain and cochain complexes is that, in chain complexes, the boundary operators decrease dimension, whereas in cochain complexes they increase dimension.
A bounded chain complex is one in which almost all the Ai are 0; i.e., a finite complex extended to the left and right by 0's. An example is the complex defining the homology theory of a (finite) simplicial complex. A chain complex is bounded above if all degrees above some fixed degree N are 0, and is bounded below if all degrees below some fixed degree are 0. Clearly, a complex is bounded both above and below if and only if the complex is bounded.
Leaving out the indices, the basic relation on d can be thought of as








The elements of the individual groups of a chain complex are called chains (or cochains in the case of a cochain complex.) The image of d is the group of boundaries, or in a cochain complex, coboundaries. The kernel of d (i.e., the subgroup sent to 0 by d) is the group of cycles, or in the case of a cochain complex, cocycles. From the basic relation, the (co)boundaries lie inside the (co)cycles. This phenomenon is studied in a systematic way using (co)homology groups.
Chain maps and tensor product
There is a natural notion of a morphism between chain complexes called a chain map. Given two complexes M* and N*, a chain map between the two is a series of homomorphisms from Mi to Ni such that the entire diagram involving the boundary maps of M and N commutes. Chain complexes with chain maps form a category.
If V = V* and W = W* are chain complexes, their tensor product

 
  is a chain complex with degree i elements given by



and differential given by


 
  where a and b are any two homogeneous vectors in V and W respectively, and 
 
 
 
  denotes the degree of a.
This tensor product makes the category 
 
 
 
  (for any commutative ring K) of chain complexes of K-modules into a symmetric monoidal category. The identity object with respect to this monoidal product is the base ring K viewed as a chain complex in degree 0. The braiding is given on simple tensors of homogeneous elements by


 
 . The sign is necessary for the braiding to be a chain map. Moreover, the category of chain complexes of K-modules also has internal Hom: given chain complexes V and W, the internal Hom of V and W, denoted hom(V,W) is the chain complex with degree n elements given by 
 
 
 
  and differential given by


 
  We have a natural isomorphism



Examples
Singular homology
Suppose we are given a topological space X.
Define Cn(X) for natural n to be the free abelian group formally generated by singular n-simplices in X, and define the boundary map






(\partial_n \sigma = \sum_{i=0}^n (-1)^i \sigma([v_0,\ldots, \hat v_i, \ldots, v_n]),
where the hat denotes the omission of a vertex. That is, the boundary of a singular simplex is alternating sum of restrictions to its faces. It can be shown ∂² = 0, so 
 
 
 
  is a chain complex; the singular homology

 
  is the homology of this complex; that is,








de Rham cohomology
The differential k-forms on any smooth manifold M form an abelian group (in fact an R-vector space) called Ωk(M) under addition. The exterior derivative dk maps Ωk(M) to Ωk+1(M), and d2 = 0 follows essentially from symmetry of second derivatives, so the vector spaces of k-forms along with the exterior derivative are a cochain complex:



The cohomology of this complex is called the de Rham cohomology:


 
  {locally constant functions on M with values in R} 
 
 
#{connected pieces of M}



Chain maps
A chain map f between two chain complexes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a sequence 
 
 
 
  of module homomorphisms

 
  for each n that commutes with the boundary operators on the two chain complexes
 
 
 
 . Such a map sends cycles to cycles and boundaries to boundaries, and thus descends to a map on homology
 
 
 
 .
A continuous map of topological spaces induces chain maps in both the singular and de Rham chain complexes described above (and in general for the chain complex defining any homology theory of topological spaces) and thus a continuous map induces a map on homology. Because the map induced on a composition of maps is the composition of the induced maps, these homology theories are functors from the category of topological spaces with continuous maps to the category of abelian groups with group homomorphisms.
It is worth noticing that the concept of chain map reduces to the one of boundary through the construction of the cone of a chain map.
Chain homotopy
Chain homotopies give an important equivalence relation between chain maps. Chain homotopic chain maps induce the same maps on homology groups. A particular case is that homotopic maps between two spaces X and Y induce the same maps from homology of X to homology of Y. Chain homotopies have a geometric interpretation; it is described, for example, in the book of Bott and Tu. See Homotopy category of chain complexes for further information.

Dold–Kan correspondence says there is an equivalence between the category of chain complexes and the category of simplicial abelian groups.
