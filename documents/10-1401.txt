   Lignostilbene alphabeta-dioxygenase      Lignostilbene alphabeta-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a lignostilbene alphabeta-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethylene + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 vanillin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethylene and O 2 , whereas its product is vanillin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,2-bis(4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenyl)ethylene:oxygen oxidoreductase (alphabeta-bond-cleaving) . It employs one cofactor , iron .  References     "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Iron enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
