   Formaldehyde dismutase      Formaldehyde dismutase   In enzymology , a formaldehyde dismutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 formaldehyde   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formate + methanol   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , formaldehyde , and two products , formate and methanol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formaldehyde:formaldehyde oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include aldehyde dismutase , and cannizzanase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
