   Chinese monoid      Chinese monoid  In mathematics, the '''Chinese monoid''' i s a monoid generated by a totally ordered alphabet with the relations cba = cab = bca for every a ≤ b ≤ c . An algorithm similar to Schensted's algorithm yields characterisation of the equivalence classes and a cross-section theorem . It was discovered by  during their classification of monoids with growth similar to that of the plactic monoid , and studied in detail by Julien Cassaigne, Marc Espie, Daniel Krob, Jean-Christophe Novelli, and Florent Hivert in 2001. 1  The Chinese monoid has a regular language cross-section        a  *      (   b  a   )   *     b  *      (   c  a   )   *     (   c  b   )   *    c  *   ⋯       superscript  a     superscript    b  a      superscript  b     superscript    c  a      superscript    c  b      superscript  c    normal-⋯    a^{*}\ (ba)^{*}b^{*}\ (ca)^{*}(cb)^{*}c^{*}\cdots     and hence polynomial growth of dimension     n   (   n  +  1   )    2        n    n  1    2    \frac{n(n+1)}{2}   . 2  References     "  Category:Combinatorics  Category:Semigroup theory     ↩  ↩
