   Bogomol'nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield state      Bogomol'nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield state   In theoretical physics, BPS states are massive representations of an extended supersymmetry algebra with mass equal to the supersymmetry central charge  Z . Quantum mechanically, if the supersymmetry is not broken, the mass is exactly equal to the modulus of Z . Their importance arises as the multiplets are shorter than for generic massive representations, the states are stable and the mass formula is exact.  ==d=4 N=2==  The generators for the odd part of the superalgebra have relations: 1      {   Q  α  A   ,    Q  ¯     β  ˙   B    }      superscript   subscript  Q  α   A    subscript   normal-¯  Q      normal-˙  β   B      \displaystyle\{Q_{\alpha}^{A},\bar{Q}_{\dot{\beta}B}\}     where    α   β  ˙       α   normal-˙  β     \alpha\dot{\beta}   are the Lorentz group indices, A and B are R symmetry indices.  Take linear combinations of the above generators as follows:      R  α  A     superscript   subscript  R  α   A    \displaystyle R_{\alpha}^{A}     Consider a state ψ which has 4 momentum    (  M  ,  0  ,  0  ,  0  )     M  0  0  0    (M,0,0,0)   . Applying the following operator to this state gives:        (    R  1  1   +    (   R  1  1   )   †    )   2   ψ       superscript     superscript   subscript  R  1   1    superscript   superscript   subscript  R  1   1   normal-†    2   ψ    \displaystyle(R_{1}^{1}+(R_{1}^{1})^{\dagger})^{2}\psi     But because this is the square of a Hermitian operator, the right hand side coefficient must be positive for all   ξ   ξ   \xi   .  In particular the strongest result from this is      M  ≥   |  Z  |       M    Z     \displaystyle M\geq|Z|     Example applications   Supersymmetric black hole entropies 2   See also   Bogomol'nyi–Prasad–Sommerfield bound , short supermultiplet , wall-crossing   References  "  Category:Quantum field theory     ↩  ↩
