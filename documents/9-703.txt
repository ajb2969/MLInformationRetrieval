Eilenberg's inequality

Eilenberg's inequality is a mathematical inequality for Lipschitz-continuous functions.
Let ƒ : X → Y be a Lipschitz-continuous function between separable metric spaces whose Lipschitz constant is denoted by Lip ƒ. Then, Eilenberg's inequality states that



for any A ⊂ X and all 0 ≤ n ≤ m, where

the asterisk denotes the upper Lebesgue integral,
vn is the volume of the unit ball in Rn,
Hn is the n-dimensional Hausdorff measure.
