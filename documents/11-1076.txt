D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine transaminase




D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine transaminase

In enzymology, a D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  4-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are 4-hydroxyphenylglyoxylate and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-4-hydroxyphenylglycine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase. This enzyme is also called D-hydroxyphenylglycine aminotransferase. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
