   Hydraulic diameter      Hydraulic diameter   The hydraulic diameter , D H , is a commonly used term when handling flow in noncircular tubes and channels. Using this term one can calculate many things in the same way as for a round tube. It is defined as       D  H   =    4  A   P        subscript  D  H       4  A   P     D_{H}=\frac{4A}{P}     where A is the cross sectional  area and P is the wetted perimeter of the cross-section.  The Manning formula contains a quantity called the hydraulic radius . Despite what the name may suggest, the hydraulic diameter is not twice the hydraulic radius, but four times.  Hydraulic diameter is mainly used for calculations involving turbulent flow . Secondary flows can be observed in non-circular ducts as a result of turbulent shear stress in the turbulent flow.  Hydraulic diameter is also used in calculation of heat transfer in internal flow problems.
