Blaschke selection theorem

The Blaschke selection theorem is a result in topology and convex geometry about sequences of convex sets. Specifically, given a sequence 
 
 
 
  of convex sets contained in a bounded set, the theorem guarantees the existence of a subsequence 
 
 
 
  and a convex set 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  converges to 
 
 
 
  in the Hausdorff metric. The theorem is named for Wilhelm Blaschke.
Alternate statements

A succinct statement of the theorem is that a metric space of convex bodies is locally compact.


Using the Hausdorff metric on sets, every infinite collection of compact subsets of the unit ball has a limit point (and that limit point is itself a compact set).

Application
As an example of its use, the isoperimetric problem can be shown to have a solution.1 That is, there exists a curve of fixed length that encloses the maximum area possible. Other problems likewise can be shown to have a solution:

Lebesgue universal cover problem for a convex universal cover of minimal size for the collection of all sets in the plane of unit diameter,2
the maximum inclusion problem,3
and the Moser's worm problem for a convex universal cover of minimal size for the collection of planar curves of unit length.4
