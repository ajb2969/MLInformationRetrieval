Gross substitutes

The term gross substitutes is used in two slightly different meanings:

In microeconomics, two commodities 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are called gross substitutes, if 
 
 
 
 . I.e., an increase in the price of one commodity causes people to want strictly more of the other commodity, since the commodities can substitute each other (bus and taxi are a common example).
In competitive equilibrium theory, a valuation function is said to have the gross substitutes (GS) property if for all pairs of commodities
 
 
 
 . I.e., the definition includes both substitute goods and independent goods, and only rules out complementary goods. See Utility functions on indivisible goods#Gross substitutes.
