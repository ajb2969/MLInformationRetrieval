   Accounting rate of return      Accounting rate of return   Accounting rate of return , also known as the Average rate of return , or ARR is a financial ratio used in capital budgeting . 1 The ratio does not take into account the concept of time value of money . ARR calculates the return, generated from net income of the proposed capital investment. The ARR is a percentage return. Say, if ARR = 7%, then it means that the project is expected to earn seven cents out of each dollar invested (yearly). If the ARR is equal to or greater than the required rate of return, the project is acceptable. If it is less than the desired rate, it should be rejected. When comparing investments, the higher the ARR, the more attractive the investment. 2 Over one-half of large firms calculate ARR when appraising projects. 3  Basic formulas       ARR  =   Average return during period  Average investment       ARR    Average return during period  Average investment     \text{ARR}=\frac{\text{Average return during period }}{\text{Average %
 investment}}      where       Average investment  =   Book value at beginning of year 1 + Book value at end of useful life  2       Average investment    Book value at beginning of year 1 + Book value at end of useful life  2     \text{Average investment}=\frac{\text{Book value at beginning of year 1 + Book%
  value at end of useful life}}{\text{2}}   =Profit/investment equals to ARR.   ARR = Incremental Revenue - Incremental Expenses (Including Depreciation)/Initial Investment  Average Profit = Profit After Tax/Life of Investment  References  "  Category:Financial ratios     Accounting Rate of Return - ARR ↩  Chapter 19 Accounting Rate of Return ↩  Arnold, G.
