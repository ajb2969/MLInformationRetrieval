   Psi2 Aurigae      Psi2 Aurigae     For other star systems with this Bayer designation , see Psi Aurigae .    Psi 2 Aurigae (ψ 2 Aur, ψ 2 Aurigae) is a star in the constellation  Auriga . It is faintly visible to the naked eye with an apparent visual magnitude of 4.79. 1 Based upon parallax measurements, this star is approximately  away from the Earth. At that distance, the brightness of the star is diminished by 0.07 in magnitude from extinction caused by interstellar gas and dust . 2  Most studies categorized this as a K-type  giant star with a stellar classification of K3 III. 3 However, the results of a study published in 2003 list it with a classification of K3 Iab:, which would instead suggest it is a supergiant star . 4 5 The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening , is . 6 At the estimated distance of this star, 7 this yields a physical size of about 27 times the radius of the Sun . 8  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 54\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 9  10  11  12  }}  External links   HR 2427  CCDM J06394+4229  [ http://aladin.u-strasbg.fr/AladinPreview?-c=*++50+Aur&ident; ;=*++50+Aur&submit;=Aladin+previewer Image Psi 2 Aurigae]   "  Category:Auriga (constellation)  Category:K-type giants  Aurigae, Psi02  Aurigae, 50  047174  031832             ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
