   Universal bundle      Universal bundle   In mathematics , the universal bundle in the theory of fiber bundles with structure group a given topological group    G   G   G   , is a specific bundle over a classifying space     B  G      B  G    BG   , such that every bundle with the given structure group    G   G   G   over   M   M   M   is a pullback by means of a continuous map     M  →  B  G      M  normal-→  B  G    M→BG   .  Existence of a universal bundle  In the CW complex category  When the definition of the classifying space takes place within the homotopy category of CW complexes , existence theorems for universal bundles arise from Brown's representability theorem .  For compact Lie groups  We will first prove:   Proposition. Let   G   G   G   be a compact Lie group . There exists a contractible space    E  G      E  G    EG   on which   G   G   G   acts freely. The projection    E  G  →  B  G      E  G  normal-→  B  G    EG→BG   is a   G   G   G   -principal fibre bundle.   Proof. There exists an injection of   G   G   G   into a unitary group     U   (  n  )       U  n    U(n)   for   n   n   n   big enough. 1 If we find    E  U   (  n  )       E  U  n    EU(n)   then we can take    E  G      E  G    EG   to be    E  U   (  n  )       E  U  n    EU(n)   . The construction of    E  U   (  n  )       E  U  n    EU(n)   is given in classifying space for    U   (  n  )       U  n    U(n)    .  The following Theorem is a corollary of the above Proposition.   Theorem. If   M   M   M   is a paracompact manifold and    P  →  M      P  normal-→  M    P→M   is a principal   G   G   G   -bundle, then there exists a map    f  :   M  →  B  G      normal-:  f    M  normal-→  B  G     f:M→BG   , unique up to homotopy, such that   P   P   P   is isomorphic to , the pull-back of the   G   G   G   -bundle    E  G  →  B  G      E  G  normal-→  B  G    EG→BG   by   f   f   f   .   Proof. On one hand, the pull-back of the bundle    π  :   E  G  →  B  G      normal-:  π    E  G  normal-→  B  G     π:EG→BG   by the natural projection is the bundle    P  ×  E  G      P  normal-×  E  G    P×EG   . On the other hand, the pull-back of the principal   G   G   G   -bundle    P  →  M      P  normal-→  M    P→M   by the projection is also    P  ×  E  G      P  normal-×  E  G    P×EG           P    →      P  ×  E   G     →     E  G       ↓     ↓       ↓  π       M     →   s        P   ×  G   E   G     →     B  G         P  normal-→      P  E   G   normal-→    E  G     normal-↓   missing-subexpression   normal-↓   missing-subexpression    normal-↓  absent  π     M   subscript  normal-→  s       subscript   G   P  E   G   normal-→    B  G      \begin{array}[]{rcccl}P&\to&P\times EG&\to&EG\\
 \downarrow&&\downarrow&&\downarrow\pi\\
 M&\to_{\!\!\!\!\!\!\!s}&P\times_{G}EG&\to&BG\end{array}     Since   p   p   p   is a fibration with contractible fibre    E  G      E  G    EG   , sections of   p   p   p   exist. 2 To such a section   s   s   s   we associate the composition with the projection . The map we get is the   f   f   f   we were looking for.  For the uniqueness up to homotopy, notice that there exists a one to one correspondence between maps    f  :   M  →  B  G      normal-:  f    M  normal-→  B  G     f:M→BG   such that is isomorphic to    P  →  M      P  normal-→  M    P→M   and sections of   p   p   p   . We have just seen how to associate a   f   f   f   to a section. Inversely, assume that   f   f   f   is given. Let be an isomorphism:      Φ  :    {    (  x  ,  u  )   ∈    M  ×  E    G     :    f   (  x  )    =   π   (  u  )     }   →  P      normal-:  normal-Φ   normal-→   conditional-set     x  u       M  E   G        f  x     π  u     P     \Phi:\left\{(x,u)\in M\times EG\ :\ f(x)=\pi(u)\right\}\to P     Now, simply define a section by      {      M  →    P   ×  G   E   G          x  ↦   [   Φ   (  x  ,  u  )    ,  u  ]           cases   normal-→  M      subscript   G   P  E   G    otherwise   maps-to  x     normal-Φ   x  u    u    otherwise    \begin{cases}M\to P\times_{G}EG\\
 x\mapsto[\Phi(x,u),u]\end{cases}     Because all sections of   p   p   p   are homotopic, the homotopy class of   f   f   f   is unique.  Use in the study of group actions  The total space of a universal bundle is usually written    E  G      E  G    EG   . These spaces are of interest in their own right, despite typically being contractible . For example in defining the homotopy quotient or homotopy orbit space of a group action of   G   G   G   , in cases where the orbit space is pathological (in the sense of being a non- Hausdorff space , for example). The idea, if   G   G   G   acts on the space   X   X   X   , is to consider instead the action on    Y  =   X  ×  E  G       Y    X  normal-×  E  G     Y=X×EG   , and corresponding quotient. See equivariant cohomology for more detailed discussion.  If    E  G      E  G    EG   is contractible then   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   are homotopy equivalent spaces. But the diagonal action on   Y   Y   Y   , i.e. where   G   G   G   acts on both   X   X   X   and    E  G      E  G    EG   coordinates, may be well-behaved when the action on   X   X   X   is not.
