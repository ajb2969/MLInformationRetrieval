Semisimple algebraic group

In mathematics, especially in the areas of abstract algebra and algebraic geometry studying linear algebraic groups, a semisimple algebraic group is a type of matrix group which behaves much like a semisimple Lie algebra or semisimple ring.
Definition
A linear algebraic group is called semisimple if and only if the (solvable) radical of the identity component is trivial.
Equivalently, a semisimple linear algebraic group has no non-trivial connected, normal, abelian subgroups.
Examples

Over an algebraically closed field 
 
 
 
 , the special linear group

 
  is semisimple.


Every direct sum of simple algebraic groups is semisimple.
