   Nagell–Lutz theorem      Nagell–Lutz theorem   In mathematics , the Nagell–Lutz theorem is a result in the diophantine geometry of elliptic curves , which describes rational  torsion points on elliptic curves over the integers.  Definition of the terms  Suppose that the equation       y  2   =    x  3   +   a   x  2    +   b  x   +  c        superscript  y  2      superscript  x  3     a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c     y^{2}=x^{3}+ax^{2}+bx+c     defines a non-singular  cubic curve with integer coefficients  a , b , c , and let D be the discriminant of the cubic polynomial on the right side:       D  =     -   4   a  3   c    +    a  2    b  2    +   18  a  b  c    -   4   b  3    -   27   c  2      .      D          4   superscript  a  3   c       superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2      18  a  b  c      4   superscript  b  3      27   superscript  c  2       D=-4a^{3}c+a^{2}b^{2}+18abc-4b^{3}-27c^{2}.     Statement of the theorem  If P = ( x , y ) is a rational point of finite order on C , for the elliptic curve group law , then:   1) x and y are integers  2) either y = 0, in which case P has order two, or else y divides D , which immediately implies that y 2 divides D .   Generalizations  The Nagell–Lutz theorem generalizes to arbitrary number fields and more general cubic equations. 1 For curves over the rationals, the generalization says that, for a nonsingular cubic curve whose Weierstrass form        y  2   +    a  1   x  y   +    a  3   y    =    x  3   +    a  2    x  2    +    a  4   x   +   a  6           superscript  y  2      subscript  a  1   x  y      subscript  a  3   y       superscript  x  3      subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2       subscript  a  4   x    subscript  a  6      y^{2}+a_{1}xy+a_{3}y=x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{4}x+a_{6}   has integer coefficients, any rational point P =( x , y ) of finite order must have integer coordinates, or else have order 2 and coordinates of the form x = m /4, y = n /8, for m and n integers.  History  The result is named for its two independent discoverers, the Norwegian Trygve Nagell (1895–1988) who published it in 1935, and Élisabeth Lutz (1937).
