   Colin de Verdière graph invariant      Colin de Verdière graph invariant   Colin de Verdière's invariant is a graph parameter    μ   (  G  )       μ  G    \mu(G)   for any graph  G, introduced by Yves Colin de Verdière in 1990. It was motivated by the study of the maximum multiplicity of the second eigenvalue of certain Schrödinger operators . 1  Definition  Let    G  =   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G=(V,E)   be a loopless simple graph. Assume without loss of generality that    V  =   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }       V   1  normal-…  n     V=\{1,\dots,n\}   . Then    μ   (  G  )       μ  G    \mu(G)   is the largest corank of any symmetric matrix     M  =   (   M   i  ,  j    )   ∈   ℝ   (  n  )          M   subscript  M   i  j          superscript  ℝ  n      M=(M_{i,j})\in\mathbb{R}^{(n)}   such that:   (M1) for all    i  ,  j     i  j    i,j   with    i  ≠  j      i  j    i\neq j        M   i  ,  j    <  0       subscript  M   i  j    0    M_{i,j}<0   if i and j are adjacent, and     M   i  ,  j    =  0       subscript  M   i  j    0    M_{i,j}=0   if i and j are nonadjacent;  (M2) M has exactly one negative eigenvalue, of multiplicity 1;  (M3) there is no nonzero matrix    X  =   (   X   i  ,  j    )   ∈   ℝ   (  n  )          X   subscript  X   i  j          superscript  ℝ  n      X=(X_{i,j})\in\mathbb{R}^{(n)}   such that     M  X   =  0        M  X   0    MX=0   and such that     X   i  ,  j    =  0       subscript  X   i  j    0    X_{i,j}=0   whenever    i  =  j      i  j    i=j   or     M   i  ,  j    ≠  0       subscript  M   i  j    0    M_{i,j}\neq 0   . 2 3   Characterization of known graph families  Several well-known families of graphs can be characterized in terms of their Colin de Verdière invariants:    if and only if G has no edges ; 4 5   if and only if G is a linear forest (disjoint union of paths); 6 7   if and only if G is outerplanar ; 8 9   if and only if G is planar ; 10 11   if and only if G is linklessly embeddable graph 12 13   These same families of graphs also show up in connections between the Colin de Verdière invariant of a graph and the structure of its complement graph :   If the complement of an n -vertex graph is a linear forest, then ; 14 15  If the complement of an n -vertex graph is outerplanar, then ; 16 17  If the complement of an n -vertex graph is planar, then . 18 19   Graph minors  A minor of a graph is another graph formed from it by contracting edges and by deleting edges and vertices. The Colin de Verdière invariant is minor-monotone, meaning that taking a minor of a graph can only decrease or leave unchanged its invariant:   If H is a minor of G then     μ   (  H  )    ≤   μ   (  G  )          μ  H     μ  G     \mu(H)\leq\mu(G)   . 20    By the Robertson–Seymour theorem , for every k there exists a finite set H of graphs such that the graphs with invariant at most k are the same as the graphs that do not have any member of H as a minor.  lists these sets of forbidden minors for k ≤ 3; for k = 4 the set of forbidden minors consists of the seven graphs in the Petersen family , due to the two characterizations of the linklessly embeddable graphs as the graphs with μ ≤ 4 and as the graphs with no Petersen family minor. 21  Chromatic number  conjectured that any graph with Colin de Verdière invariant μ may be colored with at most μ + 1 colors. For instance, the linear forests have invariant 1, and can be 2-colored ; the outerplanar graphs have invariant two, and can be 3-colored; the planar graphs have invariant 3, and (by the four color theorem ) can be 4-colored.  For graphs with Colin de Verdière invariant at most four, the conjecture remains true; these are the linklessly embeddable graphs , and the fact that they have chromatic number at most five is a consequence of a proof by  of the Hadwiger conjecture for K 6 -minor-free graphs.  Other properties  If a graph has crossing number  k , it has Colin de Verdière invariant at most k + 3. For instance, the two Kuratowski graphs K 5 and K 3,3 can both be drawn with a single crossing, and have Colin de Verdière invariant at most four. 22  Influence  Colin de Verdière invariant is defined from a special class of matrices corresponding to a graph instead of just a single matrix related to the graph. Along the same line other graph parameters are defined and studied such as minimum rank of a graph , minimum semidefinite rank of a graph and minimum skew rank of a graph .  Notes  References    .
