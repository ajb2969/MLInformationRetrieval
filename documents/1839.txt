   Tait equation      Tait equation   In fluid mechanics , the Tait equation is an equation of state , used to relate liquid density to pressure . The equation was originally published by Peter Guthrie Tait in 1888. 1 It is sometimes written as       β  0   (  P  )    =     -  1    V  0   (  P  )       (    ∂  V    ∂  P    )   T    =    0.4343  C     V  0   (  P  )     (   B  +  P   )            superscript   subscript  β  0   P         1    superscript   subscript  V  0   P     subscript      V     P    T             0.4343  C      superscript   subscript  V  0   P     B  P        \beta_{0}^{(P)}=\frac{-1}{V_{0}^{(P)}}\left(\frac{\partial V}{\partial P}%
 \right)_{T}=\frac{0.4343C}{V_{0}^{(P)}(B+P)}     or in the integrated form       V  0   (  P  )    =    V  0   (  1  )    -   C    log  10     B  +  P    B  +   P   (  1  )              superscript   subscript  V  0   P      superscript   subscript  V  0   1     C    subscript   10       B  P     B   superscript  P  1          V_{0}^{(P)}=V_{0}^{(1)}-C\log_{10}\frac{B+P}{B+P^{(1)}}     where       β  0   (  P  )      superscript   subscript  β  0   P    \beta_{0}^{(P)}   is the compressibility of the substance (often, water ) (in units of bar −1 )      V  0     subscript  V  0    V_{0}   is the specific volume of the substance (in units of ml / g )     B   B   B   and   C   C   C   are functions of temperature that are independent of pressure 2   References  "  Category:Fluid mechanics     ↩
