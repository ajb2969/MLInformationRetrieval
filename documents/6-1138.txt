   Selection (relational algebra)      Selection (relational algebra)   In relational algebra , a selection (sometimes called a restriction to avoid confusion with SQL 's use of SELECT) is a unary operation written as     σ   a  θ  b     (  R  )        subscript  σ    a  θ  b    R    \sigma_{a\theta b}(R)   or     σ   a  θ  v     (  R  )        subscript  σ    a  θ  v    R    \sigma_{a\theta v}(R)   where:      a   a   a   and   b   b   b   are attribute names     θ   θ   \theta   is a binary operation in the set    {  <  ,  ≤  ,  =  ,  ≠  ,  ≥  ,  >  }             \{\;<,\leq,=,\neq,\geq,\;>\}        v   v   v   is a value constant     R   R   R   is a relation   The selection     σ   a  θ  b     (  R  )        subscript  σ    a  θ  b    R    \sigma_{a\theta b}(R)   selects all those tuples in   R   R   R   for which   θ   θ   \theta   holds between the   a   a   a   and the   b   b   b   attribute.  The selection     σ   a  θ  v     (  R  )        subscript  σ    a  θ  v    R    \sigma_{a\theta v}(R)   selects all those tuples in   R   R   R   for which   θ   θ   \theta   holds between the   a   a   a   attribute and the value   v   v   v   .  For an example, consider the following tables where the first table gives the relation    P  e  r  s  o  n      P  e  r  s  o  n    Person   , the second table gives the result of     σ    A  g  e   ≥  34     (   P  e  r  s  o  n   )        subscript  σ      A  g  e   34      P  e  r  s  o  n     \sigma_{Age\geq 34}(Person)   and the third table gives the result of     σ    A  g  e   =   W  e  i  g  h  t      (   P  e  r  s  o  n   )        subscript  σ      A  g  e     W  e  i  g  h  t       P  e  r  s  o  n     \sigma_{Age=Weight}(Person)   .          P  e  r  s  o  n      P  e  r  s  o  n    Person           σ    A  g  e   ≥  34     (   P  e  r  s  o  n   )        subscript  σ      A  g  e   34      P  e  r  s  o  n     \sigma_{Age\geq 34}(Person)           σ    A  g  e   =   W  e  i  g  h  t      (   P  e  r  s  o  n   )        subscript  σ      A  g  e     W  e  i  g  h  t       P  e  r  s  o  n     \sigma_{Age=Weight}(Person)           style="border: 1px solid black" Name   style="border: 1px solid black" Age   style="border: 1px solid black" Weight     Harry   34   80     Sally   28   64     George   29   70     Helena   54   54     Peter   34   80         style="border: 1px solid black" Name   style="border: 1px solid black" Age   style="border: 1px solid black" Weight     Harry   34   80     Helena   54   54     Peter   34   80         style="border: 1px solid black" Name   style="border: 1px solid black" Age   style="border: 1px solid black" Weight     Helena   54   54        More formally the semantics of the selection is defined as follows:        σ   a  θ  b     (  R  )    =   {  t  :   t  ∈   R  ,   t   (  a  )    θ   t   (  b  )      }          subscript  σ    a  θ  b    R    conditional-set  t    t   R    t  a  θ  t  b        \sigma_{a\theta b}(R)=\{\ t:t\in R,\ t(a)\ \theta\ t(b)\ \}           σ   a  θ  v     (  R  )    =   {  t  :   t  ∈   R  ,   t   (  a  )    θ    v      }          subscript  σ    a  θ  v    R    conditional-set  t    t   R    t  a  θ  v        \sigma_{a\theta v}(R)=\{\ t:t\in R,\ t(a)\ \theta\ v\ \}     The result of the selection is only defined if the attribute names that it mentions are in the heading of the relation that it operates upon.  In computer languages it is expected that any truth-valued expression be permitted as the selection condition rather than restricting it to be a simple comparison.  In SQL , selections are performed by using [[Where (SQL)|WHERE]] definitions in [[Select (SQL)|SELECT]] , [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]] , and [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]] statements, but note that the selection condition can result in any of three truth values ( true , false and unknown ) instead of the usual two.
