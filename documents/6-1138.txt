Selection (relational algebra)

In relational algebra, a selection (sometimes called a restriction to avoid confusion with SQL's use of SELECT) is a unary operation written as 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  where:



 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are attribute names


 
  is a binary operation in the set 
 
 



 
  is a value constant


 
  is a relation

The selection 
 
 
 
 
  selects all those tuples in 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
  holds between the 
 
 
 
  and the 
 
 
 
  attribute.

  selects all those tuples in 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
  holds between the 
 
 
 
  attribute and the value 
 
 
 
 .
For an example, consider the following tables where the first table gives the relation 
 
 
 
 
 , the second table gives the result of 
 
 
 
  and the third table gives the result of

More formally the semantics of the selection is defined as follows:






The result of the selection is only defined if the attribute names that it mentions are in the heading of the relation that it operates upon.
In computer languages it is expected that any truth-valued expression be permitted as the selection condition rather than restricting it to be a simple comparison.
In SQL, selections are performed by using [[Where (SQL)|WHERE]] definitions in [[Select (SQL)|SELECT]], [[Update (SQL)|UPDATE]], and [[Delete (SQL)|DELETE]] statements, but note that the selection condition can result in any of three truth values (true, false and unknown) instead of the usual two.
