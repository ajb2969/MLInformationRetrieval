   Acyloxyacyl hydrolase      Acyloxyacyl hydrolase   In enzymology , an acyloxyacyl hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-(acyloxy)acyl group of bacterial lipopolysaccharide (lipid A moiety)   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxyacyl group of bacterial lipopolysaccharide + a fatty acid   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , the 3-(acyloxy)acyl groups of bacterial lipopolysaccharides , and two products , [partially deacylated lipopolysaccharide] and fatty acid .  The enzyme removes from lipid A the secondary acyl chains that are needed for lipopolysaccharides to be recognized by the MD-2--TLR4 receptor on animal cells. This reaction inactivates the lipopolysaccharide (endotoxin). Acyloxyacyl hydrolase is produced by monocyte-macrophages, neutrophils, dendritic cells, and renal cortical epithelial cells. It is a protein of Mr = ~60,000 that has two disulfide-linked subunits. The smaller subunit, of Mr = ~14,000 (including glycosylation), is a member of the SAPLIP (saposin-like protein) family along with amoebopore, granulysin, acid sphingomyelinase, surfactant protein B, and the 4 sphingolipid activator proteins (saposins). The larger subunit, Mr = 50,000, contains the active site serine and the other elements of the His-Asp-Ser triad; AOAH is a GDSL lipase that has activity toward certain glycerolipids in addition to its presumed major in vivo substrate, LPS.
