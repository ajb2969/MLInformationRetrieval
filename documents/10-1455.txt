   Cytokinin dehydrogenase      Cytokinin dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cytokinin dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 6 -dimethylallyladenine + acceptor + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenine + 3-methylbut-2-enal + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N6-dimethylallyladenine , acceptor , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are adenine , 3-methylbut-2-enal , and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N6-dimethylallyladenine:acceptor oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include N6-dimethylallyladenine:(acceptor) oxidoreductase , 6-N-dimethylallyladenine:acceptor oxidoreductase , OsCKX2 , CKX , and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
