   Zariski's lemma      Zariski's lemma   In algebra , Zariski's lemma , introduced by Oscar Zariski , states that if K is a finitely generated algebra over a field  k and if K is a field , then K is a finite field extension of k .  An important application of the lemma is a proof of the weak form of Hilbert's nullstellensatz : 1 if I is a proper ideal of    k   [   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   ]       k    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n      k[t_{1},...,t_{n}]   ( k  algebraically closed field ), then I has a zero; i.e., there is a point x in    k  n     superscript  k  n    k^{n}   such that     f   (  x  )    =  0        f  x   0    f(x)=0   for all f in I . Proof: it is enough to consider a maximal ideal    𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   . Let    A  =   k   [   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  n   ]        A    k    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  n       A=k[t_{1},...,t_{n}]   and    ϕ  :   A  →   A  /  𝔪       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  A    A  𝔪      \phi:A\to A/\mathfrak{m}   be the natural surjection. By the lemma,     A  /  𝔪   =  k        A  𝔪   k    A/\mathfrak{m}=k   and then for any    f  ∈  𝔪      f  𝔪    f\in\mathfrak{m}   ,       f   (   ϕ   (   t  1   )    ,  ⋯  ,   ϕ   (   t  n   )    )    =   ϕ   (   f   (   t  1   ,  ⋯  ,   t  n   )    )    =  0          f     ϕ   subscript  t  1    normal-⋯    ϕ   subscript  t  n        ϕ    f    subscript  t  1   normal-⋯   subscript  t  n           0     f(\phi(t_{1}),\cdots,\phi(t_{n}))=\phi(f(t_{1},\cdots,t_{n}))=0   ; that is to say,    x  =   (   ϕ   (   t  1   )    ,  ⋯  ,   ϕ   (   t  n   )    )       x     ϕ   subscript  t  1    normal-⋯    ϕ   subscript  t  n       x=(\phi(t_{1}),\cdots,\phi(t_{n}))   is a zero of   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   .  The lemma may also be understood from the following perspective. In general, a ring R is a Jacobson ring if and only if every finitely generated R -algebra that is a field is finite over R . 2 Thus, the lemma follows from the fact that a field is a Jacobson ring.  Proof  Two direct proofs, one of which is due to Zariski, are given in Atiyah–MacDonald. 3 4 The lemma is also a consequence of the Noether normalization lemma . Indeed, by the normalization lemma, K is a finite module over the polynomial ring    k   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  d   ]       k    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  d      k[x_{1},\ldots,x_{d}]   where     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  d       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  d     x_{1},\ldots,x_{d}   are algebraically independent over k . But since K has Krull dimension zero, the polynomial ring must have dimension zero; i.e.,    d  =  0      d  0    d=0   . For Zariski's original proof, see the original paper. 5  In fact, the lemma is a special case of the general formula     dim  A   =     tr  .  deg   k   A        dimension  A     subscript   formulae-sequence  tr  deg   k   A     \dim A=\operatorname{tr.deg}_{k}A   for a finitely generated k -algebra A that is an integral domain, which is also a consequence of the normalization lemma.
