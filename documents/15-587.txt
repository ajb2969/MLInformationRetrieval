Zariski's lemma

In algebra, Zariski's lemma, introduced by Oscar Zariski, states that if K is a finitely generated algebra over a field k and if K is a field, then K is a finite field extension of k.
An important application of the lemma is a proof of the weak form of Hilbert's nullstellensatz:1 if I is a proper ideal of 
 
 
 
  (k algebraically closed field), then I has a zero; i.e., there is a point x in 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all f in I.Proof: it is enough to consider a maximal ideal

 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the natural surjection. By the lemma, 
 
 
 
  and then for any 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 ; that is to say, 
 
 
 
  is a zero of 
 
 
 
 .
The lemma may also be understood from the following perspective. In general, a ring R is a Jacobson ring if and only if every finitely generated R-algebra that is a field is finite over R.2 Thus, the lemma follows from the fact that a field is a Jacobson ring.
Proof
Two direct proofs, one of which is due to Zariski, are given in Atiyah–MacDonald.34 The lemma is also a consequence of the Noether normalization lemma. Indeed, by the normalization lemma, K is a finite module over the polynomial ring 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  are algebraically independent over k. But since K has Krull dimension zero, the polynomial ring must have dimension zero; i.e., 
 
 
 
 . For Zariski's original proof, see the original paper.5
In fact, the lemma is a special case of the general formula 
 
 
 
  for a finitely generated k-algebra A that is an integral domain, which is also a consequence of the normalization lemma.
