   Topological K-theory      Topological K-theory   In mathematics , topological   K   K   K   -theory is a branch of algebraic topology . It was founded to study vector bundles on topological spaces , by means of ideas now recognised as (general) K-theory that were introduced by Alexander Grothendieck . The early work on topological   K   K   K   -theory is due to Michael Atiyah and Friedrich Hirzebruch .  Definitions  Let   X   X   X   be a compact  Hausdorff space and    k  =   ùêë  ,  ùêÇ       k   ùêë  ùêÇ     k=\mathbf{R},\mathbf{C}   . Then is the Grothendieck group of the commutative monoid of isomorphism classes of finite-dimensional   k   k   k   -vector bundles over   X   X   X   under Whitney sum . Tensor product of bundles gives   K   K   K   -theory a commutative ring structure. Without subscripts,    K   (  X  )       K  X    K(X)   usually denotes complex   K   K   K   -theory whereas real   K   K   K   -theory is sometimes written as    K  O   (  X  )       K  O  X    KO(X)   . The remaining discussion is focussed on complex   K   K   K   -theory, the real case being similar.  As a first example, note that the   K   K   K   -theory of a point are the integers. This is because vector bundles over a point are trivial and thus classified by their rank and the Grothendieck group of the natural numbers are the integers.  There is also a reduced version of   K   K   K   -theory,     K  ~    (  X  )        normal-~  K   X    \widetilde{K}(X)   , defined for   X   X   X   a compact pointed space (cf. reduced homology ). This reduced theory is intuitively    K   (  X  )       K  X    K(X)   modulo trivial bundles . It is defined as the group of stable equivalence classes of bundles. Two bundles   E   E   E   and   F   F   F   are said to be stably isomorphic if there are trivial bundles and , so that . This equivalence relation results in a group since every vector bundle can be completed to a trivial bundle by summing with its orthogonal complement. Alternatively,     K  ~    (  X  )        normal-~  K   X    \widetilde{K}(X)   can be defined as the kernel of the map  induced by the inclusion of the base point into   X   X   X   .     K   K   K   -theory forms a multiplicative (generalized) cohomology theory as follows. The short exact sequence of a pair of pointed spaces    (  X  ,  A  )     X  A    (X,A)           K  ~    (   X  /  A   )    ‚Üí    K  ~    (  X  )    ‚Üí    K  ~    (  A  )         normal-‚Üí     normal-~  K     X  A       normal-~  K   X     normal-‚Üí       normal-~  K   A      \widetilde{K}(X/A)\to\widetilde{K}(X)\to\widetilde{K}(A)     extends to a long exact sequence       ‚ãØ  ‚Üí    K  ~    (   S  X   )    ‚Üí    K  ~    (   S  A   )    ‚Üí    K  ~    (   X  /  A   )    ‚Üí    K  ~    (  X  )    ‚Üí    K  ~    (  A  )     .       normal-‚Üí  normal-‚ãØ     normal-~  K     S  X      normal-‚Üí       normal-~  K     S  A      normal-‚Üí       normal-~  K     X  A      normal-‚Üí       normal-~  K   X     normal-‚Üí       normal-~  K   A      \cdots\to\widetilde{K}(SX)\to\widetilde{K}(SA)\to\widetilde{K}(X/A)\to%
 \widetilde{K}(X)\to\widetilde{K}(A).     Let be the   n   n   n   -th reduced suspension of a space and then define          K  ~    -  n     (  X  )    :=    K  ~    (    S  n   X   )     ,   n  ‚â•  0.      formulae-sequence   assign     superscript   normal-~  K     n    X      normal-~  K      superscript  S  n   X       n  0.     \widetilde{K}^{-n}(X):=\widetilde{K}(S^{n}X),\qquad n\geq 0.     Negative indices are chosen so that the coboundary maps increase dimension. One-point compactification extends this definition to locally compact spaces without base points:         K   -  n     (  X  )    =     K  ~    -  n     (   X  +   )     .         superscript  K    n    X      superscript   normal-~  K     n     subscript  X       K^{-n}(X)=\widetilde{K}^{-n}(X_{+}).     Finally, the Bott periodicity theorem as formulated below extends the theories to positive integers.  Properties   respectively     K  ~   n     superscript   normal-~  K   n    \widetilde{K}^{n}   is a contravariant functor from the homotopy category of (pointed) spaces to the category of commutative rings. Thus, for instance, the   K   K   K   -theory over contractible spaces is always   ùêô   ùêô   \mathbf{Z}   .  The spectrum of   K   K   K   -theory is    B  U  √ó  ùêô      B  U  normal-√ó  ùêô    BU√ó\mathbf{Z}   (with the discrete topology on   ùêô   ùêô   \mathbf{Z}   ), i.e. , where     ,    absent   ,   denotes pointed homotopy classes and    B  U      B  U    BU   is the colimit of the classifying spaces of the unitary groups : . Similarly,            K  ~    (  X  )    ‚âÖ   [  X  ,    ùêô  √ó  B   U   ]    .         normal-~  K   X    X      ùêô  B   U      \widetilde{K}(X)\cong[X,\mathbf{Z}\times BU].       For real   K   K   K   -theory use    B  O      B  O    BO   .    There is a natural  ring homomorphism  , the Chern character , such that is an isomorphism.  The equivalent of the Steenrod operations in   K   K   K   -theory are the Adams operations . They can be used to define characteristic classes in topological   K   K   K   -theory.  The Splitting principle of topological   K   K   K   -theory allows one to reduce statements about arbitrary vector bundles to statements about sums of line bundles.  The Thom isomorphism theorem in topological   K   K   K   -theory is           K   (  X  )    ‚âÖ    K  ~    (   T   (  E  )    )     ,        K  X      normal-~  K     T  E      K(X)\cong\widetilde{K}(T(E)),       where    T   (  E  )       T  E    T(E)   is the Thom space of the vector bundle   E   E   E   over   X   X   X   . This holds whenever   E   E   E   is a spin-bundle.    The Atiyah-Hirzebruch spectral sequence allows computation of   K   K   K   -groups from ordinary cohomology groups.  Topological   K   K   K   -theory can be generalized vastly to a functor on C*-algebras , see operator K-theory and KK-theory .   Bott periodicity  The phenomenon of periodicity named after Raoul Bott (see Bott periodicity theorem ) can be formulated this way:    K ( X ) ‚äó K ( S 2 )}} , and  Z [ H ]/( H ‚àí 1) 2 }} where H is the class of the tautological bundle on  P 1 ( C )}} , i.e. the Riemann sphere .          K  ~    n  +  2     (  X  )    =     K  ~   n    (  X  )     .         superscript   normal-~  K     n  2    X      superscript   normal-~  K   n   X     \widetilde{K}^{n+2}(X)=\widetilde{K}^{n}(X).     .   In real   K   K   K   -theory there is a similar periodicity, but modulo 8.  Applications  The two most famous applications of topological   K   K   K   -theory are both due to J. F. Adams . First he solved the Hopf invariant one problem by doing a computation with his Adams operations . Then he proved an upper bound for the number of linearly independent vector fields on spheres .
