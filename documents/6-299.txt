   Serre's property FA      Serre's property FA   In mathematics , Property FA is a property of groups first defined by Jean-Pierre Serre .  A group G is said to have property FA if every action of G on a tree has a global fixed point .  Serre shows that if a group has property FA, then it cannot split as an amalgamated product or HNN extension ; indeed, if G is contained in an amalgamated product then it is contained in one of the factors. In particular, a finitely generated group with property FA has finite abelianization .  Property FA is equivalent for countable  G to the three properties: G is not an amalgamated product; G does not have Z as a quotient group ; G is finitely generated . For general groups G the third condition may be replaced by requiring that G not be the union of a strictly increasing sequence of subgroup.  Examples of groups with property FA include SL 3 ( Z ) and more generally G ( Z ) where G is a simply-connected simple Chevalley group of rank at least 2. The group SL 2 ( Z ) is an exception, since it is isomorphic to the amalgamated product of the cyclic groups C 4 and C 6 along C 2 .  Any quotient group of a group with property FA has property FA. If some subgroup of finite index in G has property FA then so does G , but the converse does not hold in general. If N is a normal subgroup of G and both N and G / N have property FA, then so does G .  It is a theorem of Watatani that Kazhdan's property (T) implies property FA, but not conversely. Indeed, any subgroup of finite index in a T-group has property FA.  Examples  The following groups have property FA:   A finitely generated torsion group;  SL 3 ( Z );  The Schwarz group    ⟨    a  ,  b   :    a  A   =   b  B   =    (   a  b   )   C   =  1    ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩   normal-:   a  b        superscript  a  A    superscript  b  B         superscript    a  b   C        1       \left\langle{a,b:a^{A}=b^{B}=(ab)^{C}=1}\right\rangle   for integers A , B , C ≥ 2;  SL 2 ( R ) where R is the ring of integers of an algebraic number field which is not Q or an imaginary quadratic field .   The following groups do not have property FA:   SL 2 ( Z );  SL 2 ( R D ) where R D is the ring of integers of an imaginary quadratic field of discriminant not −3 or −4.
