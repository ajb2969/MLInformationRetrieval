   D-glutamyltransferase      D-glutamyltransferase   In enzymology , a D-glutamyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L(or D)-glutamine + D-glutamyl-peptide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NH 3 + 5-glutamyl-D-glutamyl-peptide   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamine , D-glutamine , and D-glutamyl-peptide , whereas its two products are NH 3 and 5-glutamyl-D-glutamyl-peptide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the aminoacyltransferases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutamine:D-glutamyl-peptide 5-glutamyltransferase . Other names in common use include D-glutamyl transpeptidase , and D-gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase . This enzyme participates in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism .
