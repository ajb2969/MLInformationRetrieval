   Optical modulation amplitude      Optical modulation amplitude   In telecommunications , optical modulation amplitude (OMA) is the difference between two optical power levels, of a digital signal generated by an optical source , e.g., a laser diode .  It is given by      OMA  =    P  1   -    P  0         OMA     subscript  P  1    subscript  P  0      \text{OMA}=P_{1}-P_{0}\,     where P 1 is the optical power level generated when the light source is "on," and P 0 is the power level generated when the light source is "off." The OMA may be specified in peak-to-peak mW .  The OMA can be related to the average power     P  av   =    (    P  1   +   P  0    )   /  2        subscript  P  av        subscript  P  1    subscript  P  0    2     P_{\text{av}}=(P_{1}+P_{0})/2   and the extinction ratio     r  e   =    P  1   /   P  0         subscript  r  e      subscript  P  1    subscript  P  0      r_{e}=P_{1}/P_{0}         OMA  =   2   P  av      r  e   -  1     r  e   +  1         OMA    2   subscript  P  av        subscript  r  e   1      subscript  r  e   1       \text{OMA}=2P_{\text{av}}\frac{r_{e}-1}{r_{e}+1}     In the limit of a high extinction ratio,    OMA  â‰ˆ   2   P   a  v         OMA    2   subscript  P    a  v       \text{OMA}\approx 2P_{av}   . However, OMA is often used to express the effective usable modulation in a signal when the extinction ratio is not high and this approximation may not be valid.
