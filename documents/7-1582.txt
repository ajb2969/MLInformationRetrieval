   Endurance (aeronautics)      Endurance (aeronautics)   In aviation , endurance is the maximum length of time that an aircraft can spend in cruising flight . Endurance is different from range , which is a measure of distance flown. For example, a typical sailplane exhibits high endurance characteristics but poor range characteristics.  Endurance can be defined as:      E  =    ∫   t  1    t  2     d  t    =   -    ∫   W  1    W  2      d  W   F     =    ∫   W  2    W  1      d  W   F          E    superscript   subscript    subscript  t  1     subscript  t  2      d  t             superscript   subscript    subscript  W  1     subscript  W  2        d  W   F            superscript   subscript    subscript  W  2     subscript  W  1        d  W   F       E=\int_{t_{1}}^{t_{2}}dt=-\int_{W_{1}}^{W_{2}}\frac{dW}{F}=\int_{W_{2}}^{W_{1}%
 }\frac{dW}{F}     where W stands for fuel weight, F for fuel flow, and t for time.  Endurance can factor into aviation design in a number of ways. Some aircraft, such as the P-3 Orion or U-2 spy plane, require high endurance characteristics as part of their mission profile (often referred to as loiter time (on target) ). The Endurance plays a prime factor in finding out the fuel fraction for an aircraft. The Endurance, like range, is also related to fuel efficiency; fuel-efficient aircraft will tend to exhibit good endurance characteristics.  References  "  Category:Aerospace engineering
