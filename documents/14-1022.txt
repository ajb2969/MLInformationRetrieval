Generality of algebra
In the history of mathematics, the '''generality of algebra''' was a phrase used by [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] to describe a method of argument that was used in the 18th century by mathematicians such as [[Leonhard Euler]] and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]],{{citation|title=A history of analysis|first=Hans Niels|last=Jahnke|publisher=American Mathematical Society|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8218-2623-2|page=131|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=CVRZEXFVsZkC&pg;=PA131&lpg;=PA131&dq;=%22generality+of+algebra%22&source;=bl&ots;=icvz

According to Koetsier,1 the generality of algebra principle assumed, roughly, that the algebraic rules that hold for a certain class of expressions can be extended to hold more generally on a larger class of objects, even if the rules are no longer obviously valid. As a consequence, 18th century mathematicians believed that they could derive meaningful results by applying the usual rules of algebra and calculus that hold for finite expansions even when manipulating infinite expansions. In works such as Cours d'Analyse, Cauchy rejected the use of "generality of algebra" methods and sought a more rigorous foundation for mathematical analysis.
