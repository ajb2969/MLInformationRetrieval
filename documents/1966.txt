The snakes model is popular in computer vision, and snakes are greatly used in applications like object tracking, shape recognition, segmentation, edge detection and stereo matching.  A snake is an energy minimizing, deformable spline influenced by constraint and image forces that pull it towards object contours and internal forces that resist deformation. Snakes may be understood as a special case of the general technique of matching a deformable model to an image by means of energy minimization. 1 In two dimensions, the active shape model represents a discrete version of this approach, taking advantage of the point distribution model to restrict the shape range to an explicit domain learned from a training set.  Snakes do not solve the entire problem of finding contours in images, since the method requires knowledge of the desired contour shape beforehand. Rather, they depend on other mechanisms such as interaction with a user, interaction with some higher level image understanding process, or information from image data adjacent in time or space.  Motivation  In computer vision, contour models describe the boundaries of shapes in an image. Snakes in particular are designed to solve problems where the approximate shape of the boundary is known. By being a deformable model, snakes can adapt to differences and noise in stereo matching and motion tracking. Additionally, the method can find Illusory contours in the image by ignoring missing boundary information.  Compared to classical feature attraction techniques, snakes have multiple advantages:   They autonomously and adaptively search for the minimum state.  External image forces act upon the snake in an intuitive manner.  Incorporating Gaussian smoothing in the image energy function introduces scale sensitivity.  They can be used to track dynamic objects.   The key drawbacks of the traditional snakes are   They are sensitive to local minima states, which can be counteracted by simulated annealing techniques.  Minute features are often ignored during energy minimization over the entire contour.  Their accuracy depends on the convergence policy. 2   Energy formulation  A simple elastic snake is defined by a set of n points    𝐯  i     subscript  𝐯  i    \mathbf{v}_{i}   where    i  =    0  …  n   -  1       i      0  normal-…  n   1     i=0\ldots n-1   , the internal elastic energy term    E   i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l      subscript  E    i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l     E_{internal}   , and the external edge-based energy term    E   e  x  t  e  r  n  a  l      subscript  E    e  x  t  e  r  n  a  l     E_{external}   . The purpose of the internal energy term is to control the deformations made to the snake, and the purpose of the external energy term is to control the fitting of the contour onto the image. The external energy is usually a combination of the forces due to the image itself    E   i  m  a  g  e      subscript  E    i  m  a  g  e     E_{image}   and the constraint forces introduced by the user    E   c  o  n      subscript  E    c  o  n     E_{con}     The energy function of the snake is the sum of its external energy and internal energy, or       E   s  n  a  k  e   *   =    ∫  0  1     E   s  n  a  k  e     (   𝐯   (  s  )    )   d  s    =    ∫  0  1     (     E   i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l     (   𝐯   (  s  )    )    +    E   i  m  a  g  e     (   𝐯   (  s  )    )    +    E   c  o  n     (   𝐯   (  s  )    )     )   d  s           superscript   subscript  E    s  n  a  k  e        superscript   subscript   0   1      subscript  E    s  n  a  k  e      𝐯  s   d  s           superscript   subscript   0   1          subscript  E    i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l      𝐯  s       subscript  E    i  m  a  g  e      𝐯  s       subscript  E    c  o  n      𝐯  s     d  s       E_{snake}^{*}=\int\limits_{0}^{1}E_{snake}(\mathbf{v}(s))\,ds=\int\limits_{0}^%

 ))\,ds     Internal energy  The internal energy of the snake is composed of the continuity of the contour    E   c  o  n  t      subscript  E    c  o  n  t     E_{cont}   and the smoothness of the contour    E   c  u  r  v      subscript  E    c  u  r  v     E_{curv}   .       E   i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l    =    E   c  o  n  t    +   E   c  u  r  v          subscript  E    i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l       subscript  E    c  o  n  t     subscript  E    c  u  r  v       E_{internal}=E_{cont}+E_{curv}    3  This can be expanded as       E   i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l    =     1  2    (   α   (  s  )     |    𝐯  s    (  s  )    |   2    )    +    1  2    (   β   (  s  )     |    𝐯   s  s     (  s  )    |   2    )     =    1  2    (    α   (  s  )     ∥     d   v  ¯     d  s     (  s  )    ∥   2    +   β   (  s  )     ∥      d  2    v  ¯     d   s  2      (  s  )    ∥   2     )           subscript  E    i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l          1  2     α  s   superscript       subscript  𝐯  s   s    2         1  2     β  s   superscript       subscript  𝐯    s  s    s    2               1  2       α  s   superscript   norm        d   normal-¯  v      d  s    s    2      β  s   superscript   norm         superscript  d  2    normal-¯  v      d   superscript  s  2     s    2         E_{internal}=\frac{1}{2}(\alpha\,\!(s)\left|\mathbf{v}_{s}(s)\right|^{2})+%

In practice, a large weight    α   (  s  )       α  s    \alpha(s)   for the continuity term penalizes changes in distances between points in the contour. A large weight    β   (  s  )       β  s    \beta(s)   for the smoothness term penalizes oscillations in the contour and will cause the contour to act as a thin plate.  Image energy  Energy in the image is some function of the features of the image. This is one of the most common points of modification in derivative methods. Features in images and images themselves can be processed in many and various ways.  For an image    I   (  x  ,  y  )       I   x  y     I(x,y)   , lines, edges, and terminations present in the image, the general formulation of energy due to the image is       E   i  m  a  g  e    =     w   l  i  n  e     E   l  i  n  e     +    w   e  d  g  e     E   e  d  g  e     +    w   t  e  r  m     E   t  e  r  m           subscript  E    i  m  a  g  e         subscript  w    l  i  n  e     subscript  E    l  i  n  e        subscript  w    e  d  g  e     subscript  E    e  d  g  e        subscript  w    t  e  r  m     subscript  E    t  e  r  m        E_{image}=w_{line}E_{line}+w_{edge}E_{edge}+w_{term}E_{term}   ,  where    w   l  i  n  e      subscript  w    l  i  n  e     w_{line}   ,    w   e  d  g  e      subscript  w    e  d  g  e     w_{edge}   ,    w   t  e  r  m      subscript  w    t  e  r  m     w_{term}   are weights of these salient features. Higher weights indicate that the salient feature will have a larger contribution to the image force.  Line functional  The line functional is the intensity of the image, which can be represented as       E   l  i  n  e    =   I   (  x  ,  y  )         subscript  E    l  i  n  e      I   x  y      E_{line}=I(x,y)     The sign of    w   l  i  n  e      subscript  w    l  i  n  e     w_{line}   will determine whether the line will be attracted to either dark lines or light lines.  Some smoothing or noise reduction may be used on the image, which then the line functional appears as       E   l  i  n  e    =   f  i  l  t  e  r   (   I   (  x  ,  y  )    )         subscript  E    l  i  n  e      f  i  l  t  e  r    I   x  y       E_{line}=filter(I(x,y))     Edge functional  The edge functional is based on the image gradient. One implementation of this is       E   e  d  g  e    =   -    |    ∇  I    (  x  ,  y  )    |   2         subscript  E    e  d  g  e       superscript       normal-∇  I    x  y     2      E_{edge}=-\left|\nabla I(x,y)\right|^{2}     A snake originating far from the desired object contour may erroneously converge to some local minimum. Scale space continuation can be used in order to avoid these local minima. This is achieved by using a blur filter on the image and reducing the amount of blur as the calculation progresses to refine the fit of the snake. The energy functional using scale space continuation is       E   e  d  g  e    =   -    |    G  σ   *    ∇  2   I    |   2         subscript  E    e  d  g  e       superscript       subscript  G  σ     superscript  normal-∇  2   I     2      E_{edge}=-\left|G_{\sigma}*\nabla^{2}I\right|^{2}     where    G  σ     subscript  G  σ    G_{\sigma}   is a Gaussian with standard deviation   σ   σ   \sigma   . Minima of this function fall on the zero-crossings of     G  σ     ∇  2   I        subscript  G  σ     superscript  normal-∇  2   I     G_{\sigma}\nabla^{2}I   which define edges as per Marr–Hildreth theory.  Termination functional  Curvature of level lines in a slightly smoothed image can be used to detect corners and terminations in an image. Using this method, let    C   (  x  ,  y  )       C   x  y     C(x,y)   be the image smoothed by       C   (  x  ,  y  )    =     G  σ   *  I    (  x  ,  y  )          C   x  y         subscript  G  σ   I    x  y      C(x,y)=G_{\sigma}*I(x,y)     with gradient angle      θ  =   arctan   (    C  y    C  x    )        θ       subscript  C  y    subscript  C  x       \theta=\arctan\Bigg(\frac{C_{y}}{C_{x}}\Bigg)   ,  unit vectors along the gradient direction      𝐧  =   (   cos  θ   ,   sin  θ   )       𝐧     θ     θ      \mathbf{n}=(\cos\theta,\sin\theta)   ,  and unit vectors perpendicular to the gradient direction       𝐧  ⟂   =   (   -   sin  θ    ,   cos  θ   )        subscript  𝐧  perpendicular-to        θ      θ      \mathbf{n}_{\perp}=(-\sin\theta,\cos\theta)   .  The termination functional of energy can be represented as       E   t  e  r  m    =    ∂  θ    ∂   n  ⟂     =      ∂  2   C   /    ∂  2    n  ⟂       ∂  C   /   ∂  n     =       C   y  y     C  x  2    -   2   C   x  y     C  x    C  y     +    C   x  x     C  y  2       (   1  +   C  x  2   +   C  y  2    )    3  /  2            subscript  E    t  e  r  m        θ      subscript  n  perpendicular-to                superscript   2   C     superscript   2    subscript  n  perpendicular-to         C     n                   subscript  C    y  y     superscript   subscript  C  x   2      2   subscript  C    x  y     subscript  C  x    subscript  C  y        subscript  C    x  x     superscript   subscript  C  y   2      superscript    1   superscript   subscript  C  x   2    superscript   subscript  C  y   2      3  2        E_{term}={\partial\theta\over\partial n_{\perp}}={\partial^{2}C/\partial^{2}n_%

 _{y}^{2}}\over(1+C_{x}^{2}+C_{y}^{2})^{3/2}}     Constraint energy  Some systems, including the original snakes implementation, allowed for user interaction to guide the snakes, not only in initial placement but also in their energy terms. Such constraint energy    E   c  o  n      subscript  E    c  o  n     E_{con}   can be used to interactively guide the snakes towards or away from particular features.  Optimization through gradient descent  Given an initial guess for a snake, the energy function of the snake is iteratively minimized. Gradient descent minimization is one of the simplest optimizations which can be used to minimize snake energy. 4 Each iteration takes one step in the negative gradient of the point with controlled step size   γ   γ   \gamma   to find local minima. This gradient-descent minimization can be implemented as        v  ¯   i   ←     v  ¯   i   +    F   s  n  a  k  e     (    v  ¯   i   )        normal-←   subscript   normal-¯  v   i      subscript   normal-¯  v   i      subscript  F    s  n  a  k  e     subscript   normal-¯  v   i       \bar{v}_{i}\leftarrow\bar{v}_{i}+F_{snake}(\bar{v}_{i})     Where     F   s  n  a  k  e     (    v  ¯   i   )        subscript  F    s  n  a  k  e     subscript   normal-¯  v   i     F_{snake}(\bar{v}_{i})   is the force on the snake, which is defined by the negative of the gradient of the energy field.        F   s  n  a  k  e     (    v  ¯   i   )    =   -    ∇   E   s  n  a  k  e      (    v  ¯   i   )     =   -   (     w   i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l     ∇   E   i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l      (    v  ¯   i   )    +    w   e  x  t  e  r  n  a  l     ∇   E   e  x  t  e  r  n  a  l      (    v  ¯   i   )     )             subscript  F    s  n  a  k  e     subscript   normal-¯  v   i         normal-∇   subscript  E    s  n  a  k  e      subscript   normal-¯  v   i                 subscript  w    i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l     normal-∇   subscript  E    i  n  t  e  r  n  a  l      subscript   normal-¯  v   i       subscript  w    e  x  t  e  r  n  a  l     normal-∇   subscript  E    e  x  t  e  r  n  a  l      subscript   normal-¯  v   i         F_{snake}(\bar{v}_{i})=-\nabla E_{snake}(\bar{v}_{i})=-\Bigg(w_{internal}%

As such, discrete approximations must be made for practical implementation of snakes.  The energy function of the snake can be approximated by using the discrete points on the snake.       E   s  n  a  k  e   *   ≈    ∑  1  n     E   s  n  a  k  e     (    v  ¯   i   )          superscript   subscript  E    s  n  a  k  e        superscript   subscript   1   n      subscript  E    s  n  a  k  e     subscript   normal-¯  v   i       E_{snake}^{*}\approx\displaystyle\sum_{1}^{n}E_{snake}(\bar{v}_{i})     Consequentially, the forces of the snake can be approximated as       F   s  n  a  k  e   *   ≈   -    ∑  1  n     ∇   E   s  n  a  k  e      (    v  ¯   i   )           superscript   subscript  F    s  n  a  k  e          superscript   subscript   1   n      normal-∇   subscript  E    s  n  a  k  e      subscript   normal-¯  v   i        F_{snake}^{*}\approx-\displaystyle\sum_{1}^{n}\nabla E_{snake}(\bar{v}_{i})     Gradient approximation can be done through any finite approximation method with respect to s , such as Finite difference .  Numerical instability due to discrete time  The introduction of discrete time into the algorithm can introduce updates which the snake is moved past the minima it is attracted to; this further can cause oscillations around the minima or lead to a different minima being found.  This can be avoided through tuning the time step such that the step size is never greater than a pixel due to the image forces. However, in regions of low energy, the internal energies will dominate the update.  Alternatively, the image forces can be normalized for each step such that the image forces only update the snake by one pixel. This can be formulated as       F   i  m  a  g  e    =   -   k    ∇   E   i  m  a  g  e      ∥   ∇   E   i  m  a  g  e     ∥           subscript  F    i  m  a  g  e        k     normal-∇   subscript  E    i  m  a  g  e      norm   normal-∇   subscript  E    i  m  a  g  e           F_{image}=-k\frac{\nabla E_{image}}{\|\nabla E_{image}\|}     where    τ  k      τ  k    \tau k   is near the value of the pixel size. This avoids the problem of dominating internal energies that arise from tuning the time step. 5  Numerical instability due to discrete space  The energies in a continuous image may have zero-crossing that do not exist as a pixel in the image. In this case, a point in the snake would oscillate between the two pixels that neighbor this zero-crossing. This oscillation can be avoided by using interpolation between pixels instead of nearest neighbor. 6  Implementation  The following pseudocode implements the snakes method in a general form  function v = snakes (I, v) % INPUT: N by M image I, a contour v of n control points  % OUTPUT: converged contour v of n control points E_image = generateImageEnergy (I);
 
   while not converged
     F_cont = weight.alpha * contourDerivative(v, 2 );
     F_curv = weight.beta * contourDerivative(v, 4 );
     F_image = interp2 (E_image, v(:, 2 ), v(:, 1 );
     F_image_norm = weight.k * F_image ./ norm (F_image);
     F_con = inputForces();
 
     F_internal = F_cont + weight.external * F_curv;
     F_external = weight.external * (F_image + F_con);
 
     v = updateSnake(v, F_internal, F_external);
 
     checkConvergence ();
   end
 
 end  Where generateImageEnergy (I) can be written as  function E_image = generateImageEnergy (I)
   [C, Cx, Cy, Cxx, Cxy, Cyy] = generateGradients (I);
 
   E_line = I;
   E_edge = -(Cx.^ 2 + Cy.^ 2 )^ 0.5 ;
   E_term = (Cyy.*Cx.^ 2 - 2 *Cxy.*Cx.*Cy + Cxx.*Cy.^ 2 )./(( 1 + Cx.^ 2 + Cy.^ 2 ).^( 1.5 ));
 
   E_image = weight.line * E_line + weight.edge * E_edge + weight.term * E_term;
 end  Some variants of snakes  The default method of snakes has various limitation and corner cases where the convergence performs poorly. Several alternatives exist which addresses issues of the default method, though with their own trade-offs. A few are listed here.  GVF snake model  The gradient vector flow (GVF) snake model 7 addresses two issues with snakes:   poor convergence performance for concave boundaries  poor convergence performance when snake is initialized far from minimum   In 2D, the GVF vector field    F   G  V  F      subscript  F    G  V  F     F_{GVF}   minimizes the energy functional       E   G  V  F    =    ∫   ∫   μ   (    u  x  2   +   u  y  2   +   v  x  2   +   v  y  2    )      +     |   ∇  f   |   2     |   𝐯  -   ∇  f    |   2   d  x  d  y         subscript  E    G  V  F            μ     superscript   subscript  u  x   2    superscript   subscript  u  y   2    superscript   subscript  v  x   2    superscript   subscript  v  y   2          superscript     normal-∇  f    2    superscript      𝐯   normal-∇  f     2   d  x  d  y      E_{GVF}=\int\int\mu(u_{x}^{2}+u_{y}^{2}+v_{x}^{2}+v_{y}^{2})+|\nabla f|^{2}|%
 \mathbf{v}-\nabla f|^{2}dxdy     where   μ   μ   \mu   is a controllable smoothing term. This can be solved by solving the Euler equations        μ    ∇  2   u    -    (   u  -    ∂   ∂  x     F   e  x  t      )    (     ∂   ∂  x     F   e  x  t      (  x  ,  y  )   2    +    ∂   ∂  y     F   e  x  t      (  x  ,  y  )   2     )     =  0          μ    superscript  normal-∇  2   u        u         x     subscript  F    e  x  t               x     subscript  F    e  x  t     superscript   x  y   2           y     subscript  F    e  x  t     superscript   x  y   2       0    \mu\nabla^{2}u-\Bigg(u-\frac{\partial}{\partial x}F_{ext}\Bigg)\Bigg(\frac{%

Reducing the value of   μ   μ   \mu   reduces the rounding but weakens the amount of smoothing.  The balloon model  The balloon model 8 addresses these problems with the default active contour model:   The snake is not attracted to distant edges.  The snake will shrink inwards if no substantial images forces are acting upon it.  a snake larger than the minima contour will eventually shrink into it, but a snake smaller than the minima contour will not find the minima and instead continue to shrink.   The balloon model introduces an inflation term into the forces acting on the snake       F   i  n  f  l  a  t  i  o  n    =    k  1    n  →    (  s  )         subscript  F    i  n  f  l  a  t  i  o  n       subscript  k  1    normal-→  n   s     F_{inflation}=k_{1}\vec{n}(s)     where     n  →    (  s  )        normal-→  n   s    \vec{n}(s)   is the normal unitary vector of the curve at    v   (  s  )       v  s    v(s)   and    k  1     subscript  k  1    k_{1}   is the magnitude of the force.    k  1     subscript  k  1    k_{1}   should have the same magnitude as the image normalization factor   k   k   k   and be smaller in value than   k   k   k   to allow forces at image edges to overcome the inflation force.  Three issues arise from using the balloon model:   Instead of shrinking, the snake expands into the minima and will not find minima contours smaller than it.  The outward force causes the contour to be slightly larger than the actual minima. This can be solved by decreasing the balloon force after a stable solution has been found.  The inflation force can overpower forces from weak edges, amplifying the issue with snakes ignoring weaker features in an image.   Diffusion snakes model  The diffusion snake model 9 addresses the sensitivity of snakes to noise, clutter, and occlusion. It implements a modification of the Mumford–Shah functional and its cartoon limit and incorporates statistical shape knowledge. The default image energy functional    E   i  m  a  g  e      subscript  E    i  m  a  g  e     E_{image}   is replaced with       E   i  m  a  g  e   *   =    E  i   +   α   E  c          superscript   subscript  E    i  m  a  g  e         subscript  E  i     α   subscript  E  c       E_{image}^{*}=E_{i}+\alpha E_{c}     where    E  i     subscript  E  i    E_{i}   is based on a modified Mumford–Shah functional       E   [  J  ,  B  ]    =     1  2     ∫  D      (    I   (   x  →   )    -   J   (   x  →   )     )   2   d   x  →      +   λ   1  2     ∫   D  /  B        ∇  →   J   (   x  →   )    ⋅   ∇  →    J   (   x  →   )   d   x  →      +   ν    ∫  0  1      (    d   d  s    B   (  s  )    )   2   d  s            E   J  B          1  2     subscript   D      superscript      I   normal-→  x      J   normal-→  x     2   d   normal-→  x        λ    1  2     subscript     D  B       normal-⋅     normal-→  normal-∇   J   normal-→  x     normal-→  normal-∇    J   normal-→  x   d   normal-→  x        ν    superscript   subscript   0   1      superscript      d    d  s    B  s   2   d  s        E[J,B]=\frac{1}{2}\int_{D}(I(\vec{x})-J(\vec{x}))^{2}d\vec{x}+\lambda\frac{1}{%

Boundaries    B   (  s  )       B  s    B(s)   are defined as       B   (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   N      p  →   n    B  n    (  s  )           B  s     superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript   normal-→  p   n    subscript  B  n   s      B(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\vec{p}_{n}B_{n}(s)     where     B  n    (  s  )        subscript  B  n   s    B_{n}(s)   are quadratic B-spline basis functions and     p  →   n     subscript   normal-→  p   n    \vec{p}_{n}   are the control points of the splines.

Different snakes will require different training data sets and tunings.  Geometric active contours  Geometric snakes, or geodesic snakes, 10 or conformal active contours 11 employs ideas from Euclidean curve shortening evolution. Contours split and merge depending on the detection of objects in the image. These models are largely implemented using level sets , and have been extensively employed in medical image computing . The level set function   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   used in this method is of the form        ∂   ∂  t    Φ   =     |   ∇  Φ   |   D  I  V   (     g   (  I  )     ∇  Φ     ∇  Φ    )    +     ∇  g    (  I  )    ⋅   ∇  Φ                t    normal-Φ          normal-∇  normal-Φ    D  I  V        g  I    normal-∇  normal-Φ     normal-∇  normal-Φ      normal-⋅     normal-∇  g   I    normal-∇  normal-Φ       \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\Phi=|\nabla\Phi|DIV\Bigg(\frac{g(I)}{\nabla\Phi}%
