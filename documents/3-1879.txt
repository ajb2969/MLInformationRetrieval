   Tits group      Tits group   In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Tits group  2 F 4 (2)′ () is a finite simple group of order   2 11 · 3 3 · 5 2 · 13 = 17971200  ≈ 2     ×   10  7       absent   superscript  10  7     \times 10^{7}   .   It is sometimes considered a 27th sporadic group .  History and properties  The Ree groups  2 F 4 (2 2 n +1 ) were constructed by , who showed that they are simple if n ≥ 1. The first member of this series 2 F 4 (2) is not simple. It was studied by  who showed that it is almost simple , its derived subgroup  2 F 4 (2)′ of index 2 being a new simple group, now called the Tits group. The group 2 F 4 (2) is a group of Lie type and has a BN pair , but the Tits group itself does not have a BN pair . Because the Tits group is not strictly a group of Lie type, it is sometimes regarded as a 27th sporadic group . 1  The Schur multiplier of the Tits group is trivial and its outer automorphism group has order 2, with the full automorphism group being the group 2 F 4 (2).  The Tits group occurs as a maximal subgroup of the Fischer group Fi 22 . The groups 2 F 4 (2) also occurs as a maximal subgroup of the Rudvalis group , as the point stabilizer of the rank-3 permutation action on 4060 = 1 + 1755 + 2304 points.  The Tits group is one of the simple N-groups , and was overlooked in John G. Thompson 's first announcement of the classification of simple N -groups, as it had not been discovered at the time. It is also one of the thin finite groups .  The Tits group was characterized in various ways by  and .  Maximal subgroups  and  independently found the 8 classes of maximal subgroups of the Tits group as follows:  L 3 (3):2 Two classes, fused by an outer automorphism. These subgroup fix points of rank 4 permutation representations.  2.[2 8 ].5.4 Centralizer of an involution.

It has an outer automorphism obtained by sending ( a , b ) to ( a , bbabababababbababababa ).
