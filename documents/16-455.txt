   Template:D5 honeycombs      Template:D5 honeycombs   This honeycomb is one of 20 uniform honeycombs constructed by the     D  ~   5     subscript   normal-~  D   5    {\tilde{D}}_{5}    Coxeter group , all but 3 repeated in other families by extended symmetry, seen in the graph symmetry of rings in the Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams . The 20 permutations are listed with its highest extended symmetry relation:      Extended symmetry   Extended diagram   Order   Honeycombs       [3 1,1 ,3,3 1,1 ]    ×1      [ [3 1,1 ,3,3 1,1 ]]    ×2   ,     1,1,3,3 1,1 ]> = [3 1,1 ,3,3,4]   =   ×2   , , , , , ,     1,1,3,3 1,1 ]>> = [4,3,3,3,4]   =   ×4   , , , , ,     [1,1,3, 1,1 ]>>] = [ [4,3,3,3,4]]   =   ×8   , ,      References  '  Category:Encyclopedic content templates
