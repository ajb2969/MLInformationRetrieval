   TRNA isopentenyltransferase      TRNA isopentenyltransferase   In enzymology , a tRNA isopentenyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   isopentenyl diphosphate + tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + tRNA containing 6-isopentenyladenosine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are isopentenyl diphosphate and tRNA , whereas its two products are diphosphate and tRNA containing 6-isopentenyladenosine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is isopentenyl-diphosphate:tRNA isopentenyltransferase . Other names in common use include transfer ribonucleate isopentenyltransferase , Delta2-isopentenyl pyrophosphate:tRNA-Delta2-isopentenyl , transferase , Delta2-isopentenyl pyrophosphate:transfer ribonucleic acid , and Delta2-isopentenyltransferase .      Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
