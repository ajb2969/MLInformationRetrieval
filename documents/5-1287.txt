List of NP-complete problems

This is a list of some of the more commonly known problems that are NP-complete when expressed as decision problems. As there are hundreds of such problems known, this list is in no way comprehensive. Many problems of this type can be found in .
Graphs and hypergraphs
Graphs occur frequently in everyday applications. Examples include biological or social networks, which contain hundreds, thousands and even billions of nodes in some cases (see e.g. Facebook or LinkedIn).

1-planarity
3-dimensional matching12
Bipartite dimension3
Capacitated minimum spanning tree4
Route inspection problem (also called Chinese postman problem) for mixed graphs (having both directed and undirected edges). The program is solvable in polynomial time if the graph has all undirected or all directed edges. Variants include the rural postman problem.5
Clique problem67
Complete coloring, a.k.a. achromatic number8
Domatic number9
Dominating set, a.k.a. domination number10



NP-complete special cases include the edge dominating set problem, i.e., the dominating set problem in line graphs. NP-complete variants include the connected dominating set problem and the maximum leaf spanning tree problem.11





Bandwidth problem12
Clique cover problem1314
Rank coloring a.k.a. cycle rank
Degree-constrained spanning tree15
Exact cover problem. Remains NP-complete for 3-sets. Solvable in polynomial time for 2-sets (this is a matching).1617
Feedback vertex set1819
Feedback arc set2021
Graph homomorphism problem22
Graph coloring2324
Graph partition into subgraphs of specific types (triangles, isomorphic subgraphs, Hamiltonian subgraphs, forests, perfect matchings) are known NP-complete. Partition into cliques is the same problem as coloring the complement of the given graph. A related problem is to find a partition that is optimal terms of the number of edges between parts.25
Hamiltonian completion26
Hamiltonian path problem, directed and undirected.2728
Longest path problem29
Maximum bipartite subgraph or (especially with weighted edges) maximum cut.3031
Maximum independent set32
Maximum Induced path33
Graph intersection number34
Metric dimension of a graph35
Minimum k-cut
Minimum spanning tree, or Steiner tree, for a subset of the vertices of a graph.36 (The minimum spanning tree for an entire graph is solvable in polynomial time.)
Pathwidth37
Set cover (also called minimum cover problem) This is equivalent, by transposing the incidence matrix, to the hitting set problem.3839
Set splitting problem 40
Shortest total path length spanning tree41
Slope number two testing42
Treewidth43
Vertex cover4445

Mathematical programming

3-partition problem46
Bin packing problem47
Knapsack problem and several variants4849
Variations on the Traveling salesman problem. The problem for graphs is NP-complete if the edge lengths are assumed integers. The problem for points on the plane is NP-complete with the discretized Euclidean metric and rectilinear metric. The problem is known to be NP-hard with the (non-discretized) Euclidean metric.50
Bottleneck traveling salesman51
Integer programming. The variant where variables are required to be 0 or 1, called zero-one linear programming, and several other variants are also NP-complete5253
Numerical 3-dimensional matching54
Partition problem5556
Quadratic assignment problem57
Solving two-variable quadratic polynomials over the integers.58 Given positive integers 
 
 
 
 , find positive integers 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 

Quadratic programming (NP-hard in some cases, P if convex)
Subset sum problem59

Formal languages and string processing

Closest string60
Longest common subsequence problem61
The bounded variant of the Post correspondence problem62
Shortest common supersequence63
String-to-string correction problem64

(Generalized) Sudoku
Super Mario Bros84
Problems related to Tetris85
Verbal arithmetic

Other

Art gallery problem and its variations.
Berth allocation problem86
Assembling an optimal Bitcoin block.87
Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT).8889 There are many variations that are also NP-complete. An important variant is where each clause has exactly three literals (3SAT), since it is used in the proof of many other NP-completeness results.90
Conjunctive Boolean query91
Cyclic ordering
Circuit satisfiability problem
Uncapacitated Facility Location
Flow Shop Scheduling Problem
Generalized assignment problem
Upward planarity testing92
Hospitals-and-residents problem with couples
Some problems related to Job-shop scheduling
Monochromatic triangle93
Minimum maximal independent set a.k.a. minimum independent dominating set94



NP-complete special cases include the minimum maximal matching problem,95 which is essentially equal to the edge dominating set problem (see above).
