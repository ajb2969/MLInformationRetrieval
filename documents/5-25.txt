   Stein factorization      Stein factorization   In algebraic geometry, the Stein factorization , introduced by  for the case of complex spaces, states that a proper morphism can be factorized as a composition of a finite mapping and a proper morphism with connected fibers. Roughly speaking, Stein factorization contracts the connected components of the fibers of a mapping to points.  One version for schemes states the following:   Let X be a scheme , S a locally noetherian scheme and    f  :   X  →  S      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  S     f:X\to S   a proper morphism . Then one can write      f  =   g  ∘   f  ′        f    g   superscript  f  normal-′      f=g\circ f^{\prime}   where    g  :    S  ′   →  S      normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  S  normal-′   S     g:S^{\prime}\to S   is a finite morphism and     f  ′   :   X  →   S  ′       normal-:   superscript  f  normal-′    normal-→  X   superscript  S  normal-′      f^{\prime}:X\to S^{\prime}   is a proper morphism so that      f  *  ′    𝒪  X    =   𝒪   S  ′           subscript   superscript  f  normal-′      subscript  𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪   superscript  S  normal-′      f^{\prime}_{*}\mathcal{O}_{X}=\mathcal{O}_{S^{\prime}}   .   The existence of this decomposition itself is not difficult. See below. But, by Zariski's connectedness theorem , the last part in the above says that the fiber     f   ′   -  1      (  s  )        superscript  f   normal-′    1     s    f^{\prime-1}(s)   is connected for any    s  ∈  S      s  S    s\in S   . It follows:  Corollary : For any    s  ∈  S      s  S    s\in S   , the set of connected components of the fiber     f   -  1     (  s  )        superscript  f    1    s    f^{-1}(s)   is in bijection with the set of points in the fiber     g   -  1     (  s  )        superscript  g    1    s    g^{-1}(s)   .  Proof  Set:       S  ′   =        superscript  S  normal-′   absent    S^{\prime}=    Spec      f  *    𝒪  X        subscript  f     subscript  𝒪  X     f_{*}\mathcal{O}_{X}   where Spec is the relative Spec . The construction gives us the natural map    g  :    S  ′   →  S      normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  S  normal-′   S     g:S^{\prime}\to S   , which is finite since    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   is coherent and f is proper. f factors through g and so we get      f  ′   :   X  →   S  ′     .     normal-:   superscript  f  normal-′    normal-→  X   superscript  S  normal-′      f^{\prime}:X\to S^{\prime}.   , which is proper. By construction      f  *  ′    𝒪  X    =   𝒪   S  ′           subscript   superscript  f  normal-′      subscript  𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪   superscript  S  normal-′      f^{\prime}_{*}\mathcal{O}_{X}=\mathcal{O}_{S^{\prime}}   . One then uses the theorem on formal functions to show that the last equality implies    f  ′     superscript  f  normal-′    f^{\prime}   has connected fibers.
