Stein factorization

In algebraic geometry, the Stein factorization, introduced by  for the case of complex spaces, states that a proper morphism can be factorized as a composition of a finite mapping and a proper morphism with connected fibers. Roughly speaking, Stein factorization contracts the connected components of the fibers of a mapping to points.
One version for schemes states the following:

Let X be a scheme, S a locally noetherian scheme and 
 
 
 
  a proper morphism. Then one can write


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a finite morphism and 
 
 
 
  is a proper morphism so that 
 
 
 
 .

The existence of this decomposition itself is not difficult. See below. But, by Zariski's connectedness theorem, the last part in the above says that the fiber 
 
 
 
  is connected for any 
 
 
 
 . It follows:
Corollary: For any 
 
 
 
 , the set of connected components of the fiber 
 
 
 
  is in bijection with the set of points in the fiber 
 
 
 
 .
Proof
Set:


Spec

 
  where Spec is the relative Spec. The construction gives us the natural map 
 
 
 
 , which is finite since 
 
 
 
  is coherent and f is proper. f factors through g and so we get 
 
 
 
 , which is proper. By construction 
 
 
 
 . One then uses the theorem on formal functions to show that the last equality implies 
 
 
 
  has connected fibers. (This part is sometimes referred to as Zariski's connectedness theorem.)
