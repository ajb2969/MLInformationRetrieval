   Vacuum solution      Vacuum solution   A vacuum solution is a solution of a field equation in which the sources of the field are taken to be identically zero. That is, such field equations are written without matter interaction (i.e.- set to zero).  Examples   In Maxwell's theory of electromagnetism , a vacuum solution would represent the electromagnetic field in a region of space where there are no electromagnetic sources (charges and electric currents), i.e. where the current 4-vector vanishes: 1        J  a   =  0       superscript  J  a   0    J^{a}=0      Einstein's theory of general relativity where a vacuum solution 2 would represent the gravitational field in a region of spacetime where there are no gravitational sources (masses), i.e. where the energy-momentum tensor vanishes: 3        T   a  b    =  0       subscript  T    a  b    0    T_{ab}=0      Kaluza–Klein vacuum (static) field equations 4    Kasner vacuum solution 5   See also   Einstein field equations  Kasner metric  Kerr metric  Maxwell's equations  Vacuum solution (general relativity)   Notes  References       "  Category:Theoretical physics     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
