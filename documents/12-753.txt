K-Poincaré algebra

In physics and mathematics, the κ-Poincaré algebra, named after Henri Poincaré, is a deformation of the Poincaré algebra into an Hopf algebra. In the bicrossproduct basis, introduced by Majid-Ruegg1 its commutation rules reads:















Where 
 
 
 
  are the translation generators, 
 
 
 
  the rotations and 
 
 
 
  the boosts. The coproducts are:











The antipodes and the counits:




























The κ-Poincaré algebra is the dual Hopf algebra to the κ-Poincaré group, and can be interpreted as its “infinitesimal” version.
