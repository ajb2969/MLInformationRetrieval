Kautz filter

In signal processing, the Kautz filter, named after William H. Kautz, is a fixed-pole traversal filter, published in 1954.12
Like Laguerre filters, Kautz filters can be implemented using a cascade of all-pass filters, with a one-pole lowpass filter at each tap between the all-pass sections.
Orthogonal set
Given a set of real poles 
 
 
 
 , the Laplace transform of the Kautz orthonormal basis is defined as the product of a one-pole lowpass factor with an increasing-order allpass factor:








 
 .
In the time domain, this is equivalent to


 
 ,
where ani are the coefficients of the partial fraction expansion as,




For discrete-time Kautz filters, the same formulas are used, with z in place of s.3
Relation to Laguerre polynomials
If all poles coincide at s = -a, then Kautz series can be written as,

 
 ,
 where Lk denotes Laguerre polynomials.
