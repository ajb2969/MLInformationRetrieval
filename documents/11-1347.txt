   Phosphopolyprenol glucosyltransferase      Phosphopolyprenol glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a phosphopolyprenol glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + polyprenyl phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + polyprenylphosphate-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and polyprenyl phosphate , whereas its two products are UDP and polyprenylphosphate-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:phosphopolyprenol D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-polyprenol monophosphate , glucosyltransferase , and UDP-glucose:polyprenol monophosphate glucosyltransferase .
