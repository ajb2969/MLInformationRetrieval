   Phenylalanine(histidine) transaminase      Phenylalanine(histidine) transaminase   In enzymology , a phenylalanine(histidine) transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-phenylalanine + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phenylpyruvate + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-phenylalanine and pyruvate , whereas its two products are phenylpyruvate and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-phenylalanine:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include phenylalanine (histidine) aminotransferase , phenylalanine(histidine):pyruvate aminotransferase , histidine:pyruvate aminotransferase , and L-phenylalanine(L-histidine):pyruvate aminotransferase .
