Taub–NUT space

The Taub–NUT space (1 or ) is an exact solution to Einstein's equations, a model universe formulated in the framework of general relativity.
The Taub–NUT metric was found by , and extended to a larger manifold by , whose initials form the "NUT" of "Taub–NUT".
Taub's solution is an empty space solution of Einstein's equations with topology R×S3 and metric


 
  where


 
  and m and l are positive constants.
Taub's metric has coordinate singularities at U=0, t=m+(m2+l2)1/2, and Newman, Tamburino and Unti showed how to extend the metric across these surfaces.
