Direct sum of topological groups

In mathematics, a topological group G is called the topological direct sum1 of two subgroups H1 and H2 if the map


 
 
  is a topological isomorphism.
More generally, G is called the direct sum of a finite set of subgroups

 
  of the map



Note that if a topological group G is the topological direct sum of the family of subgroups 
 
 
 
  then in particular, as an abstract group (without topology) it is also the direct sum (in the usual way) of the family 
 
 
 
 .
Topological direct summands
Given a topological group G, we say that a subgroup H is a topological direct summand of G (or that splits topologically form G ) if and only if there exist another subgroup K ≤ G such that G is the direct sum of the subgroups H and K.
A the subgroup H is a topological direct summand if and only if the extension of topological groups



splits, where 
 
 
 
  is the natural inclusion and 
 
 
 
  is the natural projection.
Examples

Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a locally compact abelian group that contains the unit circle

 
  as a subgroup. Then 
 
 
 
  is a topological direct summand of G. The same assertion is true for the real numbers
