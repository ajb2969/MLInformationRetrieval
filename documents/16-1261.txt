   Direct sum of topological groups      Direct sum of topological groups   In mathematics , a topological group  G is called the topological direct sum 1 of two subgroups  H 1 and H 2 if the map       H  1   √ó   H  1        subscript  H  1    subscript  H  1     \displaystyle H_{1}\times H_{1}   is a topological isomorphism.  More generally, G is called the direct sum of a finite set of subgroups        H  i   ,  i   =  1   ,   ‚Ä¶  ,  n      formulae-sequence      subscript  H  i   i   1    normal-‚Ä¶  n     H_{i},i=1,\ldots,n   of the map        ‚àè   i  =  1   n     H  i       subscript   superscript  product  n     i  1     subscript  H  i     \displaystyle\prod^{n}_{i=1}H_{i}     Note that if a topological group G is the topological direct sum of the family of subgroups    H  i     subscript  H  i    H_{i}   then in particular, as an abstract group (without topology) it is also the direct sum (in the usual way) of the family    H  i     subscript  H  i    H_{i}   .  Topological direct summands  Given a topological group G , we say that a subgroup H is a topological direct summand of G (or that splits topologically form G ) if and only if there exist another subgroup K ‚â§ G such that G is the direct sum of the subgroups H and K .  A the subgroup H is a topological direct summand if and only if the extension of topological groups      0  ‚Üí  H   ‚Üí  i   G   ‚Üí  œÄ    G  /  H   ‚Üí  0       normal-‚Üí  0  H     superscript  normal-‚Üí  i     G     superscript  normal-‚Üí  œÄ       G  H     normal-‚Üí    0     0\to H\stackrel{i}{{}\to{}}G\stackrel{\pi}{{}\to{}}G/H\to 0     splits, where   i   i   i   is the natural inclusion and   œÄ   œÄ   \pi   is the natural projection.  Examples   Suppose that   G   G   G   is a locally compact abelian group that contains the unit circle    ùïã   ùïã   \mathbb{T}   as a subgroup. Then   ùïã   ùïã   \mathbb{T}   is a topological direct summand of G . The same assertion is true for the real numbers    ‚Ñù   ‚Ñù   \mathbb{R}    2   References  "  Category:Topological groups  Category:Topology     E. Hewitt and K. A.
