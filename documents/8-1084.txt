Alkylglycerone phosphate synthase

Alkylglycerone phosphate synthase (, alkyldihydroxyacetonephosphate synthase, alkyldihydroxyacetone phosphate synthetase, alkyl DHAP synthetase, alkyl-DHAP, dihydroxyacetone-phosphate acyltransferase, DHAP-AT) is an enzyme associated with Type 3 Rhizomelic chondrodysplasia punctata.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1-acyl-glycerone 3-phosphate + a long-chain alcohol
