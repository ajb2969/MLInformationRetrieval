List of finite-dimensional Nichols algebras




List of finite-dimensional Nichols algebras
In mathematics, a [[Nichols algebra]] is a [[Hopf algebra]] in a [[braide
 d monoidal category|braided category]] assigned to a object V in this category (e.g. a braided vector space). The Nichols algebra is a quotient of the tensor algebra of V enjoying a certain universal property and is typically infinite-dimensional. Nichols algebras appear naturally in any pointed Hopf algebra and enabled their classification in important cases.1 The most well known examples for Nichols algebras are the Borel parts

 
  of the infinite-dimensional quantum groups when q is no root of unity, and the first examples of finite-dimensional Nichols algebras are the Borel parts

 
  of the Frobenius–Lusztig kernel (small quantum group) when q is a root of unity.
The following article lists all known finite-dimensional Nichols algebras 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is a Yetter–Drinfel'd module over a finite group 
 
 
 
 , where the group is generated by the support of 
 
 
 
 .

There are two major cases:
 


abelian, which implies 
 
 
 
  is diagonaly braided 
 
 
 
 
 .


nonabelian.

The rank is the number of irreducible summands 
 
 
 
  in the semisimple Yetter–Drinfel'd module 
 
 
 
 .
The irreducible summands

 
  are each associated to a conjugacy class

 
 
  and an irreducible representation 
 
 
 
  of the centralizer 
 
 
 
 .
To any Nichols algbera there is by 2 attached
 
a generalized root system and a Weyl groupoid. These are classified in.3
In particular several Dynkin diagrams (for inequivalent types of Weyl chambers). Each Dynkin diagram has one vertex per irreducible 
 
 
 
  and edges depending on their braided commutators in the Nichols algebra.

The Hilbert series of the graded algebra 
 
 
 
  is given. An observation is that it factorizes in each case into polynomials 
 
 
 
 
 . We only give the Hilbert series and dimension of the Nichols algebra in characteristic 
 
 
 
 .

Note that a Nichols algebra only depends on the braided vector space 
 
 
 
  and can therefore be realized over many different groups. Sometimes there are two or three Nichols algebras with different 
 
 
 
  and non-isomorphic Nichols algebra, which are closely related (e.g. cocycle twists of each other). These are given by different conjugacy classes in the same column.
State of classification
(as of 2015)
Established classification results

Finite-dimensional diagonal Nichols algebras over the complex numbers were classified by Heckenberger in.4 The case of arbitrary characteristic is ongoing work of Heckenberger, Wang.5
Finite-dimensional Nichols algebras of semisimple Yetter–Drinfel'd modules of rank >1 over finite nonabelian groups (generated by the support) were classified by Heckenberger and Vendramin in.6

Negative criteria
The case of rank 1 (irreducible Yetter–Drinfel'd module) over a nonabelian group is still largely open, with few examples known.
Much progress has been made by Andruskiewitsch and others by finding subracks (for example diagonal ones) that would lead to infinite-dimensional Nichols algebras. As of 2015, known groups not admitting finite-dimensional Nichols algebras are 78

for alternating groupss

9
for symmetric groups

 
 
  except a short list of examples10
some group of Lie type such as most 
 
 
11 and most unipotent classes in 
 
 
12
all sporadic groups except a short list of possibilities (resp. conjugacy classes in ATLAS notation) that are all real or j = 3-quasireal:
 
...for the Fisher group

 
  the classes 
 
 

...for the baby monster group B the classes 
 
 

...for the monster group M the classes 
 
 



Usually a large amount of conjugacy classes ae of type D ("not commutative enough"), while the others tend to possess sufficient abelian subracks and can be excluded by their consideration. Several cases have to be done by-hand. Note that the open cases tend to have very small centralizers (usually cyclic) and representations χ (usually the 1-dimensional sign representation). Significant exceptions are the conjugacy classes of order 16, 32 having as centralizers p-groups of order 2048 resp. 128 and currently no restrictions on χ.
Over abelian groups
Finite-dimensional diagonal Nichols algebras over the complex numbers were classified by Heckenberger in 13 in terms of the braiding matrix 
 
 
 
 , more precisely the data 
 
 
 
 . The small quantum groups 
 
 
 
  are a special case 
 
 
 
 
 , but there are several exceptional examples involving the primes 2,3,4,5,7.
Recently there has been progress understanding the other examples as exceptional Lie algebras and super-Lie algebras in finite characteristic.
Over nonabelian group, rank > 1
Nichols algebras from Coxeter groups
For every finite coxeter system 
 
 
 
  the Nichols algebra over the conjugacy class(es) of reflections was studied in 14 (reflections on roots of different length are not conjugate, see fourth example felow). They discovered in this way the following first Nichols algebras over nonabelian groups :

Nichols algebras from diagram folding
The following families Nichols algebras were constructed by Lentner using diagram folding,38 the fourth example appearing only in characteristic 3 was discovered during the classification of Heckenberger and Vendramin.39
The construction start with a known Nichols algebra (here diagonal ones related to quantum groups) and an additional automorphism of the Dynkin diagram. Hence the two major cases are whether this automorphism exchanges two disconnected copies or is a proper diagram automorphism of a connected Dynkin diagram. The resulting root system is folding / restriction of the original root system.40 By construction, generators and relations are known from the diagonal case.

Note that there are several more foldings, such as 
 
 
 
  and also some not of Lie type, but these violate the condition that the support generates the group.
