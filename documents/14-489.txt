Space-time Fourier transform




Space-time Fourier transform

When dealing with a problem defined in a restricted region of space and in a time interval, 
 
 
 
 , it can be useful to calculate the space-time Fourier transforms. The correlated space parameters are:









where L, D and W are the dimensions of the space region and l, m, and n are the integers.



T is the time interval and 
 
 
 
  is the volume of the concerned region.
