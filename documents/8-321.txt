   Axiom A      Axiom A   In mathematics , Smale's axiom A defines a class of dynamical systems which have been extensively studied and whose dynamics is relatively well understood. A prominent example is the Smale horseshoe map . The term "axiom A" originates with Stephen Smale . 1 2 The importance of such systems is demonstrated by the chaotic hypothesis , which states that, 'for all practical purposes', a many-body thermostatted system is approximated by an Anosov system . 3  Definition  Let M be a smooth manifold with a diffeomorphism  f : M → M . Then f is an axiom A diffeomorphism if the following two conditions hold:   The nonwandering set of f , Ω ( f ), is a hyperbolic set and compact .  The set of periodic points of f is dense in Ω ( f ).   For surfaces, hyperbolicity of the nonwandering set implies the density of periodic points, but this is no longer true in higher dimensions. Nonetheless, axiom A diffeomorphisms are sometimes called hyperbolic diffeomorphisms , because the portion of M where the interesting dynamics occurs, namely, Ω ( f ), exhibits hyperbolic behavior.  Axiom A diffeomorphisms generalize Morse–Smale systems , which satisfy further restrictions (finitely many periodic points and transversality of stable and unstable submanifolds). Smale horseshoe map is an axiom A diffeomorphism with infinitely many periodic points and positive topological entropy .  Properties  Any Anosov diffeomorphism satisfies axiom A. In this case, the whole manifold M is hyperbolic (although it is an open question whether the non-wandering set Ω ( f ) constitutes the whole M ).  Rufus Bowen showed that the non-wandering set Ω ( f ) of any axiom A diffeomorphism supports a Markov partition . 4 5 Thus the restriction of f to a certain generic subset of Ω ( f ) is conjugated to a shift of finite type .  The density of the periodic points in the non-wandering set implies its local maximality: there exists an open neighborhood U of Ω ( f ) such that         ∩   n  ∈  ℤ      f  n    (  U  )     =   Ω   (  f  )     .        subscript     n  ℤ       superscript  f  n   U      normal-Ω  f     \cap_{n\in\mathbb{Z}}f^{n}(U)=\Omega(f).     Omega stability  An important property of Axiom A systems is their structural stability against small perturbations. 6 That is, trajectories of the perturbed system remain in 1-1 topological correspondence with the unperturbed system. This property is important, in that it shows that Axiom A systems are not exceptional, but are in a sense 'generic'.  More precisely, for every C 1 - perturbation  f ε of f , its non-wandering set is formed by two compact, f ε -invariant subsets Ω 1 and Ω 2 . The first subset is homeomorphic to Ω ( f ) via a homeomorphism  h which conjugates the restriction of f to Ω ( f ) with the restriction of f ε to Ω 1 :           f  ϵ   ∘  h    (  x  )    =    h  ∘  f    (  x  )     ,    ∀  x   ∈   Ω   (  f  )      .     formulae-sequence         subscript  f  ϵ   h   x       h  f   x       for-all  x     normal-Ω  f      f_{\epsilon}\circ h(x)=h\circ f(x),\quad\forall x\in\Omega(f).     If Ω 2 is empty then h is onto Ω ( f ε ). If this is the case for every perturbation f ε then f is called omega stable . A diffeomorphism f is omega stable if and only if it satisfies axiom A and the no-cycle condition (that an orbit, once having left an invariant subset, does not return).
