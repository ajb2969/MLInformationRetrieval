Capillary action

 Capillary action (sometimes capillarity, capillary motion, or wicking) is the ability of a liquid to flow in narrow spaces without the assistance of, and in opposition to, external forces like gravity. The effect can be seen in the drawing up of liquids between the hairs of a paint-brush, in a thin tube, in porous materials such as paper, in some non-porous materials such as liquefied carbon fiber, or in a cell. It occurs because of intermolecular forces between the liquid and surrounding solid surfaces. If the diameter of the tube is sufficiently small, then the combination of surface tension (which is caused by cohesion within the liquid) and adhesive forces between the liquid and container act to lift the liquid. In short, the capillary action is due to the pressure of cohesion and adhesion which cause the liquid to work against gravity.1
History
The first recorded observation of capillary action was by Leonardo da Vinci.See:

From page 54: "Enfin, deux observations capitales, celle de l'action capillaire (7) et celle de la diffraction (8), dont jusqu'à présent on avait méconnu le véritable auteur, sont dues également à ce brillant génie." (Finally, two major observations, that of capillary action (7) and that of diffraction (8), the true author of which until now had not been recognized, are also due to this brilliant genius.)

A former student of Galileo, Niccolò Aggiunti (1600–1635), was said to have investigated capillary action.2 In 1660, capillary action was still a novelty to the Irish chemist Robert Boyle, when he reported that "some inquisitive French Men" had observed that when a capillary tube was dipped into water, the water would ascend to "some height in the Pipe". Boyle then reported an experiment in which he dipped a capillary tube into red wine and then subjected the tube to a partial vacuum. He found that the vacuum had no observable influence on the height of the liquid in the capillary, so the behavior of liquids in capillary tubes was due to some phenomenon different from that which governed mercury barometers.3

Others soon followed Boyle's lead.See, for example:

Although experimental studies continued during the 18th century,For example:

In 1740, Christlieb Ehregott Gellert (1713–1795) observed that like mercury, molten lead would not adhere to glass and therefore the level of molten lead was depressed in a capillary tube. See: C. E. Gellert (1740) "De phenomenis plumbi fusi in tubis capillaribus" (On phenomena of molten lead in capillary tubes) Commentarii academiae scientiarum imperialis Petropolitanae (Memoirs of the imperial academy of sciences in St. Petersburg), 12 : 243–251. Available on-line at: Archive.org.
Gaspard Monge (1746–1818) investigated the force between panes of glass that were separated by a film of liquid. See: Gaspard Monge (1787) "Mémoire sur quelques effets d'attraction ou de répulsion apparente entre les molécules de matière" (Memoir on some effects of the apparent attraction or repulsion between molecules of matter), Histoire de l'Académie royale des sciences, avec les Mémoires de l'Académie Royale des Sciences de Paris (History of the Royal Academy of Sciences, with the Memoirs of the Royal Academy of Sciences of Paris), pp. 506–529. Monge proposed that particles of a liquid exert, on each other, a short-range force of attraction, and that this force produces the surface tension of the liquid. From p. 529: "En supposant ainsi que l'adhérence des molécules d'un liquide n'ait d'effet sensible qu'à la surface même, & dans le sens de la surface, il seroit facile de déterminer la courbure des surfaces des liquides dans le voisinage des parois qui les conteinnent ; ces surfaces seroient des lintéaires dont la tension, constante dans tous les sens, seroit par-tout égale à l'adhérence de deux molécules ; & les phénomènes des tubes capillaires n'auroient plus rein qui ne pût être déterminé par l'analyse." (Thus by assuming that the adhesion of a liquid's molecules has a significant effect only at the surface itself, and in the direction of the surface, it would be easy to determine the curvature of the surfaces of liquids in the vicinity of the walls that contain them ; these surfaces would be menisci whose tension, [being] constant in every direction, would be everywhere equal to the adhesion of two molecules ; and the phenomena of capillary tubes would have nothing that could not be determined by analysis [i.e., calculus].) a successful quantitative treatment of capillary action8 was not attained until 1805 by two investigators: Thomas Young of England9 and Pierre-Simon Laplace of France.10 They derived the Young–Laplace equation of capillary action. By 1830, the German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss had determined the boundary conditions governing capillary action (i.e., the conditions at the liquid-solid interface).11 In 1871, the British physicist William Thomson (Lord Kelvin) determined the effect of the meniscus on a liquid's vapor pressure — a relation known as the Kelvin equation.12 The German physicist Franz Ernst Neumann (1798–1895) subsequently determined the interaction between two immiscible liquids.13

Albert Einstein's first paper, which was submitted to Annalen der Physik in 1900, was on capillarity.1415
Phenomena and physics of capillary action
 A common apparatus used to demonstrate the first phenomenon is the capillary tube. When the lower end of a vertical glass tube is placed in a liquid, such as water, a concave meniscus forms. Adhesion occurs between the fluid and the solid inner wall pulling the liquid column up until there is a sufficient mass of liquid for gravitational forces to overcome these intermolecular forces. The contact length (around the edge) between the top of the liquid column and the tube is proportional to the diameter of the tube, while the weight of the liquid column is proportional to the square of the tube's diameter. So, a narrow tube will draw a liquid column higher than a wider tube will.
In plants and trees
The capillary action is enhanced in trees by branching, evaporation at the leaves creating depressurization, and probably by osmotic pressure added at the roots and possibly at other locations inside the plant, especially when gathering humidity with air roots.1617
Examples
Capillary action is essential for the drainage of constantly produced tear fluid from the eye. Two canaliculi of tiny diameter are present in the inner corner of the eyelid, also called the lacrimal ducts; their openings can be seen with the naked eye within the lacrymal sacs when the eyelids are everted.
Wicking is the absorption of a liquid by a material in the manner of a candle wick. Paper towels absorb liquid through capillary action, allowing a fluid to be transferred from a surface to the towel. The small pores of a sponge act as small capillaries, causing it to absorb a large amount of fluid. Some textile fabrics are said to use capillary action to "wick" sweat away from the skin. These are often referred to as wicking fabrics, after the capillary properties of candle and lamp wicks.
Capillary action is observed in thin layer chromatography, in which a solvent moves vertically up a plate via capillary action. In this case the pores are gaps between very small particles.
Capillary action draws ink to the tips of fountain pen nibs from a reservoir or cartridge inside the pen.
With some pairs of materials, such as mercury and glass, the intermolecular forces within the liquid exceed those between the solid and the liquid, so a convex meniscus forms and capillary action works in reverse.
In hydrology, capillary action describes the attraction of water molecules to soil particles. Capillary action is responsible for moving groundwater from wet areas of the soil to dry areas. Differences in soil potential (
 
 
 
 ) drive capillary action in soil.
Height of a meniscus
(Figure)
Water height in a capillary plotted against capillary diameter

The height h of a liquid column is given by:18


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the liquid-air surface tension (force/unit length), θ is the contact angle, ρ is the density of liquid (mass/volume), g is local acceleration due to gravity (length/square of time19), and r is radius of tube (length). Thus the thinner the space in which the water can travel, the further up it goes.
For a water-filled glass tube in air at standard laboratory conditions, γ = 0.0728 N/m at 20 °C, θ = 0° (cos(0) = 1), ρ is 1000 kg/m3, and g = 9.81 m/s2. For these values, the height of the water column is


 
  Thus for a  diameter glass tube in lab conditions given above (radius ), the water would rise an unnoticeable . However, for a  diameter tube (radius ), the water would rise , and for a  diameter tube (radius ), the water would rise .
Liquid transport in porous media
(Figure)
Capillary flow in a brick, with a sorptivity of 5.0 mm min−1/2 and a porosity of 0.25.

When a dry porous medium, such as a brick or a wick, is brought into contact with a liquid, it will start absorbing the liquid at a rate which decreases over time. For a bar of material with cross-sectional area A that is wetted on one end, the cumulative volume V of absorbed liquid after a time t is


 
  where S is the sorptivity of the medium, with dimensions m s−1/2 or mm min−1/2. The quantity


 
  is called the cumulative liquid intake, with the dimension of length. The wetted length of the bar, that is the distance between the wetted end of the bar and the so-called wet front, is dependent on the fraction f of the volume occupied by voids. This number f is the porosity of the medium; the wetted length is then


 
  Some authors use the quantity S/f as the sorptivity.20 The above description is for the case where gravity and evaporation do not play a role.
Sorptivity is a relevant property of building materials, because it affects the amount of rising dampness. Some values for the sorptivity of building materials are in the table below.

On pages 91–92, he quotes from this book: Aggiunti attributed capillary action to "moto occulto" (hidden/secret motion).
