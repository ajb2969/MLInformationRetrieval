Conway triangle notation

In geometry, the Conway triangle notation, named after John Horton Conway, allows trigonometric functions of a triangle to be managed algebraically. Given a reference triangle whose sides are a, b and c and whose corresponding internal angles are A, B, and C then the Conway triangle notation is simply represented as follows:



where S = 2 × area of reference triangle and



in particular











 
       where 
 
 
 
  is the Brocard angle.





 
     for values of

Hence:



Some important identities:












where R is the circumradius and abc = 2SR and where r is the incenter,   
 
 
 
    and   
 
 

Some useful trigonometric conversions:






Some useful formulas:






Some examples using Conway triangle notation:
Let D be the distance between two points P and Q whose trilinear coordinates are pa : pb : pc and qa : qb : qc. Let Kp = apa + bpb + cpc and let Kq = aqa + bqb + cqc. Then D is given by the formula:



Using this formula it is possible to determine OH, the distance between the circumcenter and the orthocenter as follows:
For the circumcenter pa = aSA and for the orthocenter qa = SBSC/a



Hence:



This gives:
