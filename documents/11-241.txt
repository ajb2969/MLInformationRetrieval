(R)-2-methylmalate dehydratase

In enzymology, a (R)-2-methylmalate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-2-methylmalate 
 
 
 
  2-methylmaleate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (R)-2-methylmalate, and two products, 2-methylmaleate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-2-methylmalate hydro-lyase (2-methylmaleate-forming). Other names in common use include citraconate hydratase, citraconase, citramalate hydro-lyase, (−)-citramalate hydro-lyase, and (R)-2-methylmalate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism. It employs one cofactor, iron.
