   (R)-2-methylmalate dehydratase      (R)-2-methylmalate dehydratase   In enzymology , a (R)-2-methylmalate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-2-methylmalate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-methylmaleate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (R)-2-methylmalate , and two products , 2-methylmaleate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-2-methylmalate hydro-lyase (2-methylmaleate-forming) . Other names in common use include citraconate hydratase , citraconase , citramalate hydro-lyase , (−)-citramalate hydro-lyase , and (R)-2-methylmalate hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis and c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism . It employs one cofactor , iron .
