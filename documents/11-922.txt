Glycerophospholipid arachidonoyl-transferase (CoA-independent)

In the field of enzymology, a glycerophospholipid arachidonoyl-transferase (CoA-independent) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

1-organyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine 
 
 
 
  1-organyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
 

This enzyme catalyzes the transfer of arachidonic acid and other polyenoic fatty acids from intact choline or ethanolamine-containing glycerophospholipids to the sn-2 position of a lyso- glycerophospholipid. The organyl group on sn-1 of the donor or acceptor molecule can be alkyl, acyl or alk-1-enyl. This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-organyl-2-arachidonoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:1-organyl-2-lys o-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine arachidonoyltransferase (CoA-independent).
