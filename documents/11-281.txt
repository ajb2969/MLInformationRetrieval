   Hicks-neutral technical change      Hicks-neutral technical change   Hicks-neutral technical change is change in the production function of a business or industry which satisfies certain economic neutrality conditions. The concept of Hicks neutrality was first put forth in 1932 by John Hicks in his book The Theory of Wages . 1 A change is considered to be Hicks neutral if the change does not affect the balance of labor and capital in the products' production function . More formally, given the Solow model production function      Y  =    A  *  F    (  K  ,  L  )        Y      A  F    K  L      Y=A*F(K,L)\,   , a Hicks-neutral change is one which only changes   A   A   A   . 2  See also   List of production functions   References  Further reading        "  Category:Production economics  Category:Technological change     ↩  ↩
