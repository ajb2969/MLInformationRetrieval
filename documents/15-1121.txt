Indole-2-monooxygenase

Indole-2-monooxygenase (, BX2 (gene), CYP71C4 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name indole,NAD(P)H:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

indole + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

indolin-2-one + NAD(P)+ + H2O
 

Indole-2-monooxygenase is involved in the biosynthesis of protective and allelophatic benzoxazinoids in some plants.
