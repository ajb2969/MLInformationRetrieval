Plane curve

In mathematics, a plane curve is a curve in a Euclidean plane (compare with space curve). The most frequently studied cases are smooth plane curves (including piecewise smooth plane curves), and algebraic plane curves.
A smooth plane curve is a curve in a real Euclidean plane R2 and is a one-dimensional smooth manifold. Equivalently, a smooth plane curve can be given locally by an equation , where  is a smooth function, and the partial derivatives  and  are never both 0. In other words, a smooth plane curve is a plane curve which "locally looks like a line" with respect to a smooth change of coordinates.
An algebraic plane curve is a curve in an affine or projective plane given by one polynomial equation  (or , where f is a homogeneous polynomial, in the projective case.)
Algebraic curves were studied extensively in the 18th to 20th centuries, leading to a very rich and deep theory. Some founders of the theory are considered to be Isaac Newton and Bernhard Riemann, with main contributors being Niels Henrik Abel, Henri Poincar√©, Max Noether, among others. Every algebraic plane curve has a degree, the degree of the defining equation, which is equal, in case of an algebraically closed field, to the number of intersections of the curve with a line in general position. For example, the circle given by the equation  has degree 2.
An important classical result states that every non-singular plane curve of degree 2 in a projective plane is isomorphic to the projection of the circle . However, the theory of plane curves of degree 3 is already very deep, and connected with the Weierstrass's theory of bi-periodic complex analytic functions (cf. elliptic curves, Weierstrass P-function).
