   Plane curve      Plane curve   In mathematics, a plane curve is a curve in a Euclidean plane (compare with space curve ). The most frequently studied cases are smooth plane curves (including piecewise smooth plane curves), and algebraic plane curves .  A smooth plane curve is a curve in a real Euclidean plane R 2 and is a one-dimensional smooth manifold . Equivalently, a smooth plane curve can be given locally by an equation , where is a smooth function , and the partial derivatives and  are never both 0. In other words, a smooth plane curve is a plane curve which "locally looks like a line " with respect to a smooth change of coordinates.  An algebraic plane curve is a curve in an affine or projective plane given by one polynomial equation  (or , where f is a homogeneous polynomial , in the projective case.)  Algebraic curves were studied extensively in the 18th to 20th centuries, leading to a very rich and deep theory. Some founders of the theory are considered to be Isaac Newton and Bernhard Riemann , with main contributors being Niels Henrik Abel , Henri Poincaré , Max Noether , among others. Every algebraic plane curve has a degree, the degree of the defining equation, which is equal, in case of an algebraically closed field , to the number of intersections of the curve with a line in general position . For example, the circle given by the equation has degree 2.  An important classical result states that every non-singular plane curve of degree 2 in a projective plane is isomorphic to the projection of the circle . However, the theory of plane curves of degree 3 is already very deep, and connected with the Weierstrass 's theory of bi-periodic complex analytic functions (cf. elliptic curves , Weierstrass P-function ).
