   SIMPLE algorithm      SIMPLE algorithm   In computational fluid dynamics (CFD), SIMPLE algorithm is a widely used numerical procedure to solve the Navier-Stokes equations . SIMPLE is an acronym for Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure Linked Equations.  The SIMPLE algorithm was developed by Prof. Brian Spalding and his student Suhas Patankar at Imperial College , London in the early 1970s. Since then it has been extensively used by many researchers to solve different kinds of fluid flow and heat transfer problems. 1 2  Many popular books on computational fluid dynamics discuss the SIMPLE algorithm in detail. 3 4 A modified variant is the SIMPLER algorithm (SIMPLE Revised), that was introduced by Patankar in 1979. 5  Algorithm  The algorithm is iterative . The basic steps in the solution update are as follows:   Set the boundary conditions.  Compute the gradients of velocity and pressure.  Solve the discretized momentum equation to compute the intermediate velocity field.  Compute the uncorrected mass fluxes at faces.  Solve the pressure correction equation to produce cell values of the pressure correction.  Update the pressure field     p   k  +  1    =    p  k   +   urf  ⋅   p    ′           superscript  p    k  1       superscript  p  k    normal-⋅  urf   superscript  p   normal-′        p^{k+1}=p^{k}+\text{urf}\cdot p^{{}^{\prime}}   where urf is the under-relaxation factor for pressure.  Update the boundary pressure corrections    p  b    ′      superscript   subscript  p  b    normal-′     p_{b}^{{}^{\prime}}   .  Correct the face mass fluxes      m  ˙   f   k  +  1    =     m  ˙   f  *   +    m  ˙   f    ′          superscript   subscript   normal-˙  m   f     k  1       superscript   subscript   normal-˙  m   f      superscript   subscript   normal-˙  m   f    normal-′       \dot{m}_{f}^{k+1}=\dot{m}_{f}^{*}+\dot{m}_{f}^{{}^{\prime}}     Correct the cell velocities      v  →    k  +  1    =     v  →   *   -     Vol    ∇   p    ′        a  →   P  v          superscript   normal-→  v     k  1       superscript   normal-→  v         Vol   normal-∇   superscript  p   normal-′       superscript   subscript   normal-→  a   P   v       \vec{v}^{k+1}=\vec{v}^{*}-\frac{{\text{Vol}\ \nabla p^{{}^{\prime}}}}{{\vec{a}%
