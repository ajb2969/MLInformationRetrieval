Nucleoside ribosyltransferase




Nucleoside ribosyltransferase

In enzymology, a nucleoside ribosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-ribosyl-base1 + base2

 
  D-ribosyl-base2 + base1


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-ribosyl-base1 and base2, whereas its two products are D-ribosyl-base2 and base1.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nucleoside:purine(pyrimidine) D-ribosyltransferase. This enzyme is also called nucleoside N-ribosyltransferase.
