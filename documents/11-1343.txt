   Nucleoside ribosyltransferase      Nucleoside ribosyltransferase   In enzymology , a nucleoside ribosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-ribosyl-base 1 + base 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-ribosyl-base 2 + base 1    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-ribosyl-base 1 and base 2 , whereas its two products are D-ribosyl-base 2 and base 1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nucleoside:purine(pyrimidine) D-ribosyltransferase . This enzyme is also called nucleoside N-ribosyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
