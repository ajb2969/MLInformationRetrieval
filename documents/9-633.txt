   Maclaurin's inequality      Maclaurin's inequality   In mathematics , Maclaurin's inequality , named after Colin Maclaurin , is a refinement of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means .  Let a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n be positive  real numbers , and for k = 1, 2, ..., n define the averages S k as follows:        S  k   =      ∑   1  ≤   i  1   <  ⋯  <   i  k   ≤  n       a   i  1     a   i  2    ⋯   a   i  k       (      n      k      )     .       subscript  S  k       subscript       1   subscript  i  1        normal-⋯        subscript  i  k        n        subscript  a   subscript  i  1     subscript  a   subscript  i  2    normal-⋯   subscript  a   subscript  i  k       binomial  n  k      S_{k}=\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{1\leq i_{1}<\cdots     The numerator of this fraction is the elementary symmetric polynomial of degree k in the n variables a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n , that is, the sum of all products of k of the numbers a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n with the indices in increasing order. The denominator is the number of terms in the numerator, the binomial coefficient      (       n      k       )   .     binomial  n  k    \scriptstyle{n\choose k}.     Maclaurin's inequality is the following chain of inequalities :       S  1   ≥    S  2    ≥    S  3   3   ≥  ⋯  ≥    S  n   n          subscript  S  1      subscript  S  2            3    subscript  S  3         normal-⋯          n    subscript  S  n       S_{1}\geq\sqrt{S_{2}}\geq\sqrt[3]{S_{3}}\geq\cdots\geq\sqrt[n]{S_{n}}     with equality if and only if all the a i are equal.  For n = 2, this gives the usual inequality of arithmetic and geometric means of two numbers. Maclaurin's inequality is well illustrated by the case n = 4:          a  1   +   a  2   +   a  3   +   a  4    4           subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3    subscript  a  4    4    \displaystyle{}\quad\frac{a_{1}+a_{2}+a_{3}+a_{4}}{4}     Maclaurin's inequality can be proved using the Newton's inequalities .
