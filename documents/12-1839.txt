   Dixmier trace      Dixmier trace   In mathematics, the Dixmier trace , introduced by , is a non-normal trace on a space of linear operators on a Hilbert space larger than the space of trace class operators . Dixmier traces are examples of singular traces .  Some applications of Dixmier traces to noncommutative geometry are described in .  Definition  If H is a Hilbert space, then L 1,∞ ( H ) is the space of compact linear operators T on H such that the norm        ∥  T  ∥    1  ,  ∞    =    sup  N      ∑   i  =  1   N     μ  i    (  T  )      log   (  N  )           subscript   norm  T    1       subscript  supremum  N       superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  μ  i   T      N       \|T\|_{1,\infty}=\sup_{N}\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mu_{i}(T)}{\log(N)}     is finite, where the numbers μ i ( T ) are the eigenvalues of | T | arranged in decreasing order. Let       a  N   =     ∑   i  =  1   N     μ  i    (  T  )      log   (  N  )          subscript  a  N       superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  μ  i   T      N      a_{N}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}\mu_{i}(T)}{\log(N)}   . The Dixmier trace Tr ω ( T ) of T is defined for positive operators T of L 1,∞ ( H ) to be        Tr  ω    (  T  )    =    lim  ω    a  N          subscript  Tr  ω   T     subscript   ω    subscript  a  N      \operatorname{Tr}_{\omega}(T)=\lim_{\omega}a_{N}     where lim ω is a scale-invariant positive "extension" of the usual limit, to all bounded sequences. In other words, it has the following properties:   lim ω ( α n ) ≥ 0 if all α n ≥ 0 (positivity)  lim ω ( α n ) = lim( α n ) whenever the ordinary limit exists  lim ω ( α 1 , α 1 , α 2 , α 2 , α 3 , ...) = lim ω ( α n ) (scale invariance)   There are many such extensions (such as a Banach limit of α 1 , α 2 , α 4 , α 8 ,...) so there are many different Dixmier traces. As the Dixmier trace is linear, it extends by linearity to all operators of L 1,∞ ( H ). If the Dixmier trace of an operator is independent of the choice of lim ω then the operator is called measurable .  Properties   Tr ω ( T ) is linear in T .  If T ≥ 0 then Tr ω ( T ) ≥ 0  If S is bounded then Tr ω ( ST ) = Tr ω ( TS )  Tr ω ( T ) does not depend on the choice of inner product on H .  Tr ω ( T ) = 0 for all trace class operators T , but there are compact operators for which it is equal to 1.   A trace φ is called normal if φ (sup x α ) = sup φ ( x α ) for every bounded increasing directed family of positive operators. Any normal trace on     L   1  ,  ∞     (  H  )        superscript  L   1     H    L^{1,\infty}(H)   is equal to the usual trace, so the Dixmier trace is an example of a non-normal trace.  Examples  A compact self-adjoint operator with eigenvalues 1, 1/2, 1/3, ... has Dixmier trace equal to 1.  If the eigenvalues μ i of the positive operator T have the property that        ζ  T    (  s  )    =   Tr   (   T  s   )    =   ∑   μ  i  s             subscript  ζ  T   s    Tr   superscript  T  s            superscript   subscript  μ  i   s       \zeta_{T}(s)=\operatorname{Tr}(T^{s})=\sum{\mu_{i}^{s}}   converges for Re( s )>1 and extends to a meromorphic function near s =1 with at most a simple pole at s =1, then the Dixmier trace of T is the residue at s =1 (and in particular is independent of the choice of ω).  showed that Wodzicki's noncommutative residue of a pseudodifferential operator on a manifold is equal to its Dixmier trace.
