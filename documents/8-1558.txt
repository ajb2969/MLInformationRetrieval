   Continuous group action      Continuous group action   In topology , a continuous group action on a topological space  X is a group action of a topological group  G that is continuous: i.e.,        G  ×  X   →  X   ,    (  g  ,  x  )   ↦   g  ⋅  x       formulae-sequence   normal-→    G  X   X    maps-to   g  x    normal-⋅  g  x      G\times X\to X,\quad(g,x)\mapsto g\cdot x   is a continuous map. Together with the group action, X is called a G -space .  If    f  :   H  →  G      normal-:  f   normal-→  H  G     f:H\to G   is a continuous group homomorphism of topological groups and if X is a G -space, then H can act on X  by restriction      h  ⋅  x   =   f   (  h  )   x        normal-⋅  h  x     f  h  x     h\cdot x=f(h)x   , making X a H -space. Often f is either an inclusion or a quotient map. In particular, any topological space may be thought of a G -space via    G  →  1     normal-→  G  1    G\to 1   (and G would act trivially.)  Two basic operations are that of taking the space of points fixed by a subgroup H and that of forming a quotient by H . We write    X  H     superscript  X  H    X^{H}   for the set of all x in X such that     h  x   =  x        h  x   x    hx=x   . For example, if we write    F   (  X  ,  Y  )       F   X  Y     F(X,Y)   for the set of continuous maps from a G -space X to another G -space Y , then, with the action      (   g  ⋅  f   )    (  x  )    =   g  f   (    g   -  1    x   )           normal-⋅  g  f   x     g  f     superscript  g    1    x      (g\cdot f)(x)=gf(g^{-1}x)   ,    F    (  X  ,  Y  )   G       F   superscript   X  Y   G     F(X,Y)^{G}   consists of f such that     f   (   g  x   )    =   g  f   (  x  )          f    g  x      g  f  x     f(gx)=gf(x)   ; i.e., f is an equivariant map . We write      F  G    (  X  ,  Y  )    =   F    (  X  ,  Y  )   G           subscript  F  G    X  Y      F   superscript   X  Y   G      F_{G}(X,Y)=F(X,Y)^{G}   . Note, for example, for a G -space X and a closed subgroup H ,      F  G    (   G  /  H   ,  X  )    =   X  H          subscript  F  G      G  H   X     superscript  X  H     F_{G}(G/H,X)=X^{H}   .
