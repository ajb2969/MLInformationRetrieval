Serine—glyoxylate transaminase

In enzymology, a serine-glyoxylate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-serine + glyoxylate 
 
 
 
  3-hydroxypyruvate + glycine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-serine and glyoxylate, whereas its two products are 3-hydroxypyruvate and glycine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-serine:glyoxylate aminotransferase. This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
