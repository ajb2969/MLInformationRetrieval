Bendixson–Dulac theorem

In mathematics, the Bendixson–Dulac theorem on dynamical systems states that if there exists a 
 
 
function

 
  (called the Dulac function) such that the expression



has the same sign (
 
 
 
 
 ) almost everywhere in a simply connected region of the plane, then the plane autonomous system






has no periodic solutions lying entirely within the region.1 "Almost everywhere" means everywhere except possibly in a set of measure 0, such as a point or line.
The theorem was first established by Swedish mathematician Ivar Bendixson in 1901 and further refined by French mathematician Henri Dulac in 1933 using Green's theorem.
Proof
Without loss of generality, let there exist a function 
 
 
 
  such that



in simply connected region 
 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a closed trajectory of the plane autonomous system in 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the interior of 
 
 
 
 . Then by Green's Theorem,






But on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , so the integral evaluates to 0. This is a contradiction, so there can be no such closed trajectory 
 
 
 
 
 .
