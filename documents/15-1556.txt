Pseudaminic acid synthase

Pseudaminic acid synthase (, PseI, NeuB3) is an enzyme with system name phosphoenolpyruvate:2,4-bis(acetylamino)-2,4,6-trideoxy-beta-L-altropyranose transferase (phosphate-hydrolysing, 2,7-acetylamino-transfering, 2-carboxy-2-oxoethyl-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

phosphoenolpyruvate + 2,4-bis(acetylamino)-2,4,6-trideoxy-beta-L-altropyranose + H2O 
 
 
 
  5,7-bis(acetylamino)-3,5,7,9-tetradeoxy-L-glycero-alpha-L-manno-2-nonulopyranosonic acid + phosphate


The enzyme requires a divalent metal ion, preferably Mn2+ and Co2+.
