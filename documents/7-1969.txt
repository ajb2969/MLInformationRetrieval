Conical coordinates

(Figure)
Coordinate surfaces of the conical coordinates. The constants b and c were chosen as 1 and 2, respectively. The red sphere represents r=2, the blue elliptic cone aligned with the vertical z-axis represents μ=cosh(1) and the yellow elliptic cone aligned with the (green) x-axis corresponds to ν2 = 2/3. The three surfaces intersect at the point P (shown as a black sphere) with Cartesian coordinates roughly (1.26, -0.78, 1.34). The elliptic cones intersect the sphere in taco-shaped curves.

Conical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system consisting of concentric spheres (described by their radius 
 
 
 
 ) and by two families of perpendicular cones, aligned along the z- and x-axes, respectively.
Basic definitions
The conical coordinates 
 
 
 
  are defined by









with the following limitations on the coordinates



Surfaces of constant 
 
 
 
  are spheres of that radius centered on the origin



whereas surfaces of constant 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are mutually perpendicular cones






In this coordinate system, both Laplace's equation and the Helmholtz equation are separable.
Scale factors
The scale factor for the radius 
 
 
 
  is one (
 
 
 
 ), as in spherical coordinates. The scale factors for the two conical coordinates are
