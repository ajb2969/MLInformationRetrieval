   Arbelos      Arbelos   In geometry , an arbelos is a plane region bounded by three semicircles connected at the corners, all on the same side of a straight line (the baseline ) that contains their diameters . 1  The earliest known reference to this figure is in the Book of Lemmas by Archimedes , where some of its mathematical properties are stated as Propositions 4 through 8. 2  Etymology  The name "arbelos", used by Archimedes, comes from Greek ἡ ἄρβηλος he arbelos or ἄρβυλος arbylos , meaning "shoemaker's knife", a knife used by cobblers from antiquity to the current day, whose blade is said to resemble the geometric figure.  Properties  Two of the semicircles are necessarily concave , with arbitrary diameters a and b ; the third semicircle is convex , with diameter a + b . 3  In the following sections, the corners of the arbelos are labeled   A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   , and   C   C   C   , such that the diameter of the outer semicircle is    B  C      B  C    BC   , assumed to have unit length; and the diameters of the inner semicircles are    A  B      A  B    AB   and    A  C      A  C    AC   , assumed to have lengths r and 1− r , respectively. The letter   H   H   H   denotes the point where the outer semicircle intercepts the line that is perpendicular to the diameter    B  C      B  C    BC   through the point   A   A   A   .  Area  The area of the arbelos is equal to the area of a circle with diameter    H  A      H  A    HA   .  Proof  If BC = 1 and BA = r , then   In triangle BHA       r  2   +   h  2    =   x  2          superscript  r  2    superscript  h  2     superscript  x  2     r^{2}+h^{2}=x^{2}     In triangle CHA        (   1  -  r   )   2   +   h  2    =   y  2          superscript    1  r   2    superscript  h  2     superscript  y  2     (1-r)^{2}+h^{2}=y^{2}     In triangle BHC       x  2   +   y  2    =  1         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    1    x^{2}+y^{2}=1      By substitution     y  2   =      (   1  -  r   )   2   +   x  2    -   r  2         superscript  y  2        superscript    1  r   2    superscript  x  2     superscript  r  2      y^{2}=(1-r)^{2}+x^{2}-r^{2}   . By expansion     y  2   =    1  -   2  r    +   x  2         superscript  y  2       1    2  r     superscript  x  2      y^{2}=1-2r+x^{2}   . By substituting for y 2 into the equation for triangle BHC and solving for x :      x  =   r       x    r     x=\sqrt{r}   By substituting this, solve for y and h      y  =    1  -  r        y      1  r      y=\sqrt{1-r}         h  =    r  -   r  2         h      r   superscript  r  2       h=\sqrt{r-r^{2}}   The radius of the circle with center O is:        1  2     r  -   r  2      .        1  2       r   superscript  r  2       \frac{1}{2}\sqrt{r-r^{2}}.   Therefore, the area is:       A   c  i  r  c  l  e    =   π    (    1  2     r  -   r  2      )   2         subscript  A    c  i  r  c  l  e      π   superscript      1  2       r   superscript  r  2      2      A_{circle}=\pi\left(\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{r-r^{2}}\right)^{2}          A   c  i  r  c  l  e    =     π  r   4   -    π   r  2    4         subscript  A    c  i  r  c  l  e          π  r   4       π   superscript  r  2    4      A_{circle}=\frac{\pi r}{4}-\frac{\pi r^{2}}{4}   The area of the arbelos is the area of the large semicircle minus the area of the two smaller semicircles. Therefore the area of the arbelos is:       A   a  r  b  e  l  o  s    =    π  8   -   (     π  2     (   r  2   )   2    +    π  2     (    1  -  r   2   )   2     )         subscript  A    a  r  b  e  l  o  s        π  8         π  2    superscript    r  2   2        π  2    superscript      1  r   2   2        A_{arbelos}=\frac{\pi}{8}-\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\left(\frac{r}{2}\right)^{2}+%
 \frac{\pi}{2}\left(\frac{1-r}{2}\right)^{2}\right)          A   a  r  b  e  l  o  s    =      π  -   π   r  2    -  π   +   2  π  r    -   π   r  2     8        subscript  A    a  r  b  e  l  o  s            π    π   superscript  r  2    π     2  π  r      π   superscript  r  2     8     A_{arbelos}=\frac{\pi-\pi r^{2}-\pi+2\pi r-\pi r^{2}}{8}          A   a  r  b  e  l  o  s    =     π  r   4   -    π   r  2    4    =   A   c  i  r  c  l  e           subscript  A    a  r  b  e  l  o  s          π  r   4       π   superscript  r  2    4          subscript  A    c  i  r  c  l  e       A_{arbelos}=\frac{\pi r}{4}-\frac{\pi r^{2}}{4}=A_{circle}    Q.E.D. 4  Rectangle  Let   D   D   D   and   E   E   E   be the points where the segments    B  H      B  H    BH   and    C  H      C  H    CH   intersect the semicircles    A  B      A  B    AB   and    A  C      A  C    AC   , respectively. The quadrilateral     A  D  H  E      A  D  H  E    ADHE   is actually a rectangle .   Proof : The angles    B  D  A      B  D  A    BDA   ,    B  H  C      B  H  C    BHC   , and    A  E  C      A  E  C    AEC   are right angles because they are inscribed in semicircles (by Thales' theorem ). The quadrilateral    A  D  H  E      A  D  H  E    ADHE   therefore has three right angles, so it is a rectangle. Q.E.D.    Tangents  The line    D  E      D  E    DE   is tangent to semicircle    B  A      B  A    BA   at   D   D   D   and semicircle    A  C      A  C    AC   at   E   E   E   .   Proof : Since angle BDA is a right angle, angle DBA equals π/2 minus angle DAB. However, angle DAH also equals π/2 minus angle DAB (since angle HAB is a right angle). Therefore triangles DBA and DAH are similar . Therefore angle DIA equals angle DOH, where I is the midpoint of BA and O is the midpoint of AH. But AOH is a straight line, so angle DOH and DOA are supplementary angles . Therefore the sum of angles DIA and DOA is π. Angle IAO is a right angle. The sum of the angles in any quadrilateral is 2π, so in quadrilateral IDOA, angle IDO must be a right angle. But ADHE is a rectangle, so the midpoint O of AH (the rectangle's diagonal) is also the midpoint of DE (the rectangle's other diagonal). As I (defined as the midpoint of BA) is the center of semicircle BA, and angle IDE is a right angle, then DE is tangent to semicircle BA at D. By analogous reasoning DE is tangent to semicircle AC at E. Q.E.D.    Archimedes' circles  The altitude    A  H      A  H    AH   divides the arbelos into two regions, each bounded by a semicircle, a straight line segment, and an arc of the outer semicircle. The circles inscribed in each of these regions, known as the Archimedes' circles of the arbelos, have the same size.
