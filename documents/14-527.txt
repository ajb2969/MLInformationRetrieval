   Synchronous context-free grammar      Synchronous context-free grammar   Synchronous context-free grammars ( SynCFG or SCFG ; not to be confused with stochastic CFGs ) constitute a formal model of natural language  syntax , developed in the area of statistical machine translation (MT).  The theory of SynCFGs borrows from syntax-directed transduction and syntax-based machine translation , modeling the reordering of clauses that occurs when translating a sentence by correspondences between phrase-structure rules in the source and target languages. Performance of SCFG-based MT systems has been found comparable with, or even better than, state-of-the-art phrase-based machine translation systems. 1 Several algorithms exist to perform translation using SynCFGs. 2  Formalism  Rules in a SynCFG are superficially similar to CFG rules, except that they specify the structure of two phrases at the same time; one in the source language (the language being translated) and one in the target language. Numeric indices indicate correspondences between non-terminals in both constituent trees.
