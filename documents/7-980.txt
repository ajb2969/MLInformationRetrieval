   Newtonian gauge      Newtonian gauge    For context, see also scalar-vector-tensor decomposition and cosmological perturbation theory .    In general relativity , Newtonian gauge is a perturbed form of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker line element . The gauge freedom of general relativity is used to eliminate two scalar degrees of freedom of the metric, so that it can be written as        d   s  2    =    -    (   1  +   2  Ψ    )   d   t  2     +    a  2    (  t  )    (   1  -   2  Φ    )    δ   a  b    d   x  a   d   x  b      ,        d   superscript  s  2            1    2  normal-Ψ    d   superscript  t  2        superscript  a  2   t    1    2  normal-Φ     subscript  δ    a  b    d   superscript  x  a   d   superscript  x  b       ds^{2}=-(1+2\Psi)dt^{2}+a^{2}(t)(1-2\Phi)\delta_{ab}dx^{a}dx^{b},   where the Latin indices a and b are summed over the spatial directions and    δ   a  b      subscript  δ    a  b     \delta_{ab}   is the Kronecker delta . Conformal Newtonian gauge is the closely related gauge in which       d   s  2    =    a  2    (  t  )    [    -    (   1  +   2  Ψ    )   d   τ  2     +    (   1  -   2  Φ    )    δ   a  b    d   x  a   d   x  b     ]          d   superscript  s  2       superscript  a  2   t   delimited-[]          1    2  normal-Ψ    d   superscript  τ  2         1    2  normal-Φ     subscript  δ    a  b    d   superscript  x  a   d   superscript  x  b         ds^{2}=a^{2}(t)[-(1+2\Psi)d\tau^{2}+(1-2\Phi)\delta_{ab}dx^{a}dx^{b}]   which is related by the simple transformation     d  t   =   a   (  t  )   d  τ         d  t     a  t  d  τ     dt=a(t)d\tau   . These metrics are perturbed forms of the Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric . They are called Newtonian gauge because   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   is the Newtonian gravitational potential of classical Newtonian gravity , which satisfies the Poisson equation       ∇  2   Ψ   =   4  π  G  ρ         superscript  normal-∇  2   normal-Ψ     4  π  G  ρ     \nabla^{2}\Psi=4\pi G\rho   for non-relativistic matter and on scales where the expansion of the universe may be neglected. It includes only scalar perturbations of the metric: by the scalar-vector-tensor decomposition these evolve independently of the vector and tensor perturbations and are the predominant ones affecting the growth of structure in the universe in cosmological perturbation theory . The vector perturbations vanish in cosmic inflation and the tensor perturbations are gravitational waves , which have a negligible effect on physics except for the so-called B-modes of the cosmic microwave background  polarization . The tensor perturbation is truly gauge independent, since it is the same in all gauges.  In a universe without anisotropic stress (that is, where the stress–energy tensor is invariant under spatial rotations, or the three principal pressures are identical) the Einstein equation sets    Φ  =  Ψ      normal-Φ  normal-Ψ    \Phi=\Psi   .
