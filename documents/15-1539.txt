All-trans-nonaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (geranyl-diphosphate specific)

All-trans-nonaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (geranyl-diphosphate specific) (, nonaprenyl diphosphate synthase, solanesyl diphosphate synthase, SolPP synthase, SPP-synthase, SPP synthase, solanesyl-diphosphate synthase, OsSPS2) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate transtransferase (adding 7 isopentenyl units).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate + 7 isopentenyl diphosphate

 
  7 diphosphate + all-trans-nonaprenyl diphosphate
 

This enzyme is involved in the synthesis of the side chain of menaquinone-9.
