Adenylyl-sulfate reductase




Adenylyl-sulfate reductase

Adenylyl-sulfate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

AMP + sulfite + acceptor 
 
 
 
  adenylyl sulfate + reduced acceptor
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are AMP, sulfite, and an acceptor, whereas its two products are adenylyl sulfate and a reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is AMP,sulfite:acceptor oxidoreductase (adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-forming). Other names in common use include adenosine phosphosulfate reductase, adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate reductase, APS-reductase, APS reductase, AMP, sulfite:(acceptor) oxidoreductase, and (adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-forming). This enzyme participates in selenoamino acid metabolism and sulfur metabolism. It has 2 cofactors: FAD, and Iron.
