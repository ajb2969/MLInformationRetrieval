   Algebra over an operad      Algebra over an operad   In algebra, given an operad  O (a symmetric sequence in a symmetric monoidal ∞-category  C ), an algebra over an operad , or O -algebra for short, is, roughly, a left module over O with multiplications parametrized by O .  If O is a topological operad , then one can say an algebra over an operad is an O -monoid object in C . If C is symmetric monoidal, this recovers the usual definition.  Let C be symmetric monoidal ∞-category with monoidal structure distributive over colimits. If    f  :   O  →   O  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  O   superscript  O  normal-′      f:O\to O^{\prime}   is a map of operads and, moreover, if f is a homotopy equivalence, then the ∞-category of algebras over O in C is equivalent to the ∞-category of algebras over O ' in C . 1  See also   En-ring   Notes  References   John Francis, Derived Algebraic Geometry Over    ℰ  n     subscript  ℰ  n    \mathcal{E}_{n}   -Rings   External links   http://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/operad   "  Category:Abstract algebra     ↩
