3,4-dichloroaniline N-malonyltransferase

In enzymology, a 3,4-dichloroaniline N-malonyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

malonyl-CoA + 3,4-dichloroaniline 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-malonamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and 3,4-dichloroaniline, whereas its two products are CoA and N-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-malonamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:3,4-dichloroaniline N-malonyltransferase.
