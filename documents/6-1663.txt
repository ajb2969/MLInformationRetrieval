   Upper and lower probabilities      Upper and lower probabilities   Upper and lower probabilities are representations of imprecise probability . Whereas probability theory uses a single number, the probability , to describe how likely an event is to occur, this method uses two numbers: the upper probability of the event and the lower probability of the event.  Because frequentist statistics disallows metaprobabilities , frequentists have had to propose new solutions. Cedric Smith and Arthur Dempster each developed a theory of upper and lower probabilities. Glenn Shafer developed Dempster's theory further, and it is now known as Dempster–Shafer theory : see also Choquet(1953). More precisely, in the work of these authors one considers in a power set ,    P   (  S  )       P  S    P(S)\,\!   , a mass function    m  :    P   (  S  )    →  R      normal-:  m   normal-→    P  S   R     m:P(S)\rightarrow R   satisfying the conditions        m   (  ∅  )    =   0    ;     ∑   A  ∈   P   (  X  )       m   (  A  )     =  1.      formulae-sequence      m    0       subscript     A    P  X       m  A    1.     m(\varnothing)=0\,\,\,\,\,\,\!;\,\,\,\,\,\,\sum_{A\in P(X)}m(A)=1.\,\!     In turn, a mass is associated with two non-additive continuous measures called belief and plausibility defined as follows:        bel   (  A  )    =    ∑   B  ∣  B  ⊆  A     m   (  B  )      ;    pl   (  A  )    =    ∑   B  ∣  B  ∩  A  ≠  ∅     m   (  B  )         formulae-sequence     bel  A     subscript    fragments  B  normal-∣  B   A      m  B        pl  A     subscript    fragments  B  normal-∣  B   A        m  B       \operatorname{bel}(A)=\sum_{B\mid B\subseteq A}m(B)\,\,\,\,;\,\,\,\,%
 \operatorname{pl}(A)=\sum_{B\mid B\cap A\neq\varnothing}m(B)     In the case where   S   S   S   is infinite there can be   bel   bel   \operatorname{bel}   such that there is no associated mass function. See p. 36 of Halpern (2003). Probability measures are a special case of belief functions in which the mass function assigns positive mass to singletons of the event space only.  A different notion of upper and lower probabilities is obtained by the lower and upper envelopes obtained from a class C of probability distributions by setting         env  1    (  A  )    =    inf   p  ∈  C     p   (  A  )      ;     env  2    (  A  )    =    sup   p  ∈  C     p   (  A  )         formulae-sequence      subscript  env  1   A     subscript  infimum    p  C      p  A         subscript  env  2   A     subscript  supremum    p  C      p  A       \operatorname{env_{1}}(A)=\inf_{p\in C}p(A)\,\,\,\,;\,\,\,\,\operatorname{env_%
 {2}}(A)=\sup_{p\in C}p(A)     The upper and lower probabilities are also related with probabilistic logic : see Gerla (1994).  Observe also that a necessity measure can be seen as a lower probability and a possibility measure can be seen as an upper probability.
