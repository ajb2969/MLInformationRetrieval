Higher-order derivative test

In mathematics, the higher-order derivative test is used to find maxima, minima, and points of inflection for sufficiently differentiable real-valued functions.
The general derivative test for stationary points
Let 
 
 
 
  be a real-valued, sufficient differentiable function on the interval 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  an integer. If now holds 
 
 

then, either
n is odd and we have a local extremum at c. More precisely:



 
  is a point of a maximum


 
  is a point of a minimum

or
n is even and we have a (local) saddle point at c. More precisely:



 
  is a strictly decreasing point of inflection


 
  is a strictly increasing point of inflection

. This analytical test classifies any stationary point of 
 
 
 
 .
Example
The function 
 
 
 
  has all of its derivatives at 0 equal to 0 except for the 8th derivative, which is positive. Thus, by the test, there is a local minimum at 0.
