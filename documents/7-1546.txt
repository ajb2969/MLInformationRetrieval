   Higher-order derivative test      Higher-order derivative test   In mathematics , the higher-order derivative test is used to find maxima, minima, and points of inflection for sufficiently differentiable real-valued functions.  The general derivative test for stationary points  Let   f   f   f   be a real-valued, sufficient differentiable function on the interval     I  ⊂   \R    ,   c  ∈  I      formulae-sequence    I  \R     c  I     I\subset\R,\;c\in I   and    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   an integer. If now holds       f  ′    (  c  )    =  ⋯  =    f   (  n  )     (  c  )    =  0     and    f   (   n  +  1   )     (  c  )     ≠  0      formulae-sequence         superscript  f  normal-′   c   normal-⋯          superscript  f  n   c        0       and     superscript  f    n  1    c    0     f^{\prime}(c)=\cdots=f^{(n)}(c)=0\quad\text{and}\quad f^{(n+1)}(c)\,\not=0     then, either  n is odd and we have a local extremum at c . More precisely:         f   (   n  +  1   )     (  c  )    <  0  ⇒  c           superscript  f    n  1    c   0    normal-⇒    c     f^{(n+1)}(c)<0\Rightarrow c   is a point of a maximum        f   (   n  +  1   )     (  c  )    >  0  ⇒  c           superscript  f    n  1    c   0    normal-⇒    c     f^{(n+1)}(c)>0\Rightarrow c   is a point of a minimum   or  n is even and we have a (local) saddle point at c . More precisely:         f   (   n  +  1   )     (  c  )    <  0  ⇒  c           superscript  f    n  1    c   0    normal-⇒    c     f^{(n+1)}(c)<0\Rightarrow c   is a strictly decreasing point of inflection        f   (   n  +  1   )     (  c  )    >  0  ⇒  c           superscript  f    n  1    c   0    normal-⇒    c     f^{(n+1)}(c)>0\Rightarrow c   is a strictly increasing point of inflection   . This analytical test classifies any stationary point of   f   f   f   .  Example  The function    x  8     superscript  x  8    x^{8}   has all of its derivatives at 0 equal to 0 except for the 8th derivative, which is positive. Thus, by the test, there is a local minimum at 0.
