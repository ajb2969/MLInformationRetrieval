<h1>Extra special group</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a href="group_theory" title="wikilink">group theory</a>, a branch of <a href="abstract_algebra" title="wikilink">abstract algebra</a>, <strong>extra special groups</strong> are analogues of the <a href="Heisenberg_group" title="wikilink">Heisenberg group</a> over <a href="finite_field" title="wikilink">finite fields</a> whose size is a prime. For each prime <em>p</em> and positive integer <em>n</em> there are exactly two (up to isomorphism) extra special groups of <a href="order_(group_theory)" title="wikilink">order</a> <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup>. Extra special groups often occur in centralizers of involutions. The ordinary <a href="character_theory" title="wikilink">character theory</a> of extra special groups is well understood.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>Recall that a <a href="finite_group" title="wikilink">finite group</a> is called a <a href="p-group" title="wikilink"><em>p</em>-group</a> if its order is a power of a prime <em>p</em>.</p>
<p>A <em>p</em>-group <em>G</em> is called <strong>extra special</strong> if its <a href="center_(group_theory)" title="wikilink">center</a> <em>Z</em> is cyclic of order <em>p</em>, and the quotient <em>G</em>/<em>Z</em> is a non-trivial <a href="elementary_abelian_group" title="wikilink">elementary abelian</a> <em>p</em>-group.</p>
<p>Extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup> are often denoted by the symbol <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup>. For example, 2<sup>1+24</sup> stands for an extra special group of order 2<sup>25</sup>.</p>
<h2 id="classification">Classification</h2>
<p>Every extra special <em>p</em>-group has order <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup> for some positive integer <em>n</em>, and conversely for each such number there are exactly two extra special groups up to isomorphism. A central product of two extra special <em>p</em>-groups is extra special, and every extra special group can be written as a <a href="central_product" title="wikilink">central product</a> of extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>3</sup>. This reduces the classification of extra special groups to that of extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>3</sup>. The classification is often presented differently in the two cases <em>p</em> odd and <em>p</em> = 2, but a uniform presentation is also possible.</p>
<h3 id="p-odd"><em>p</em> odd</h3>
<p>There are two extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>3</sup>, which for <em>p</em> odd are given by</p>
<ul>
<li>The group of triangular 3x3 matrices over the field with <em>p</em> elements, with 1's on the diagonal. This group has exponent <em>p</em> for <em>p</em> odd (but exponent 4 if <em>p</em> = 2).</li>
<li>The <a href="semidirect_product" title="wikilink">semidirect product</a> of a cyclic group of order <em>p</em><sup>2</sup> by a cyclic group of order <em>p</em> acting non-trivially on it. This group has exponent <em>p</em><sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <em>n</em> is a positive integer there are two extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup>, which for <em>p</em> odd are given by</p>
<ul>
<li>The central product of <em>n</em> extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>3</sup>, all of exponent <em>p</em>. This extra special group also has exponent <em>p</em>.</li>
<li>The central product of <em>n</em> extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>3</sup>, at least one of exponent <em>p</em><sup>2</sup>. This extra special group has exponent <em>p</em><sup>2</sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup> are most easily distinguished by the fact that one has all elements of order at most <em>p</em> and the other has elements of order <em>p</em><sup>2</sup>.</p>
<p>===<em>p</em> = 2===</p>
<p>There are two extra special groups of order 8 = <em>2</em><sup>3</sup>, which are given by</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="dihedral_group" title="wikilink">dihedral group</a> <em>D</em><sub>8</sub> of order 8, which can also be given by either of the two constructions in the section above for <em>p</em> = 2 (for <em>p</em> odd they given different groups, but for <em>p</em> = 2 they give the same group). This group has 2 elements of order 4.</li>
<li>The <a href="quaternion_group" title="wikilink">quaternion group</a> <em>Q</em><sub>8</sub> of order 8, which has 6 elements of order 4.</li>
</ul>
<p>If <em>n</em> is a positive integer there are two extra special groups of order <em>2</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup>, which are given by</p>
<ul>
<li>The central product of <em>n</em> extra special groups of order 8, an odd number of which are quaternion groups. The corresponding quadratic form (see below) has Arf invariant 1.</li>
<li>The central product of <em>n</em> extra special groups of order 8, an even number of which are quaternion groups. The corresponding quadratic form (see below) has Arf invariant 0.</li>
</ul>
<p>The two extra special groups <em>G</em> of order <em>2</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup> are most easily distinguished as follows. If <em>Z</em> is the center, then <em>G</em>/<em>Z</em> is a vector space over the field with 2 elements. It has a quadratic form <em>q</em>, where <em>q</em> is 1 if the lift of an element has order 4 in <em>G</em>, and 0 otherwise. Then the <a href="Arf_invariant" title="wikilink">Arf invariant</a> of this quadratic form can be used to distinguish the two extra special groups. Equivalently, one can distinguish the groups by counting the number of elements of order 4.</p>
<h3 id="all-p">All <em>p</em></h3>
<p>A uniform presentation of the extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup> can be given as follows. Define the two groups:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="LaTeX">$M(p) = \langle a,b,c : a^p = b^p = 1, c^p = 1, ba=abc, ca=ac, cb=bc \rangle$</span></li>
<li><span class="LaTeX">$N(p) = \langle a,b,c : a^p = b^p = c, c^p = 1, ba=abc, ca=ac, cb=bc \rangle$</span></li>
</ul>
<p><em>M</em>(<em>p</em>) and <em>N</em>(<em>p</em>) are non-isomorphic extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>3</sup> with center of order <em>p</em> generated by <em>c</em>. The two non-isomorphic extra special groups of order <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup> are the central products of either <em>n</em> copies of <em>M</em>(<em>p</em>) or <em>n</em>−1 copies of <em>M</em>(<em>p</em>) and 1 copy of <em>N</em>(<em>p</em>). This is a special case of a classification of <em>p</em>-groups with cyclic centers and simple derived subgroups given in .</p>
<h2 id="character-theory">Character theory</h2>
<p>If <em>G</em> is an extra special group of order <em>p</em><sup>1+2<em>n</em></sup>, then its irreducible complex representations are given as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>There are exactly <em>p</em><sup>2<em>n</em></sup> irreducible representations of dimension 1. The center <em>Z</em> acts trivially, and the representations just correspond to the representations of the abelian group <em>G</em>/<em>Z</em>.</li>
<li>There are exactly <em>p</em>−1 irreducible representations of dimension <em>p</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>. There is one of these for each non-trivial character χ of the center, on which the center acts as multiplication by χ. The character values are given by <em>p</em><sup><em>n</em></sup>χ on <em>Z</em>, and 0 for elements not in <em>Z</em>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>If a nonabelian <em>p</em>-group <em>G</em> has less than <em>p<sup>2</sup>-p</em> nonlinear irreducible characters of minimal degree, it is extraspecial.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>It is quite common for the centralizer of an involution in a <a href="finite_simple_group" title="wikilink">finite simple group</a> to contain a normal extra special subgroup. For example, the centralizer of an involution of type 2B in the <a href="monster_group" title="wikilink">monster group</a> has structure 2<sup>1+24</sup>.Co<sub>1</sub>, which means that it has a normal extra special subgroup of order 2<sup>1+24</sup>, and the quotient is one of the <a href="Conway_group" title="wikilink">Conway groups</a>.</p>
<h2 id="generalizations">Generalizations</h2>
<p>Groups whose <a href="center_(group_theory)" title="wikilink">center</a>, <a href="derived_subgroup" title="wikilink">derived subgroup</a>, and <a href="Frattini_subgroup" title="wikilink">Frattini subgroup</a> are all equal are called <strong><a href="special_group_(finite_group_theory)" title="wikilink">special groups</a></strong>. Infinite special groups whose derived subgroup has order <em>p</em> are also called extra special groups. The classification of countably infinite extra special groups is very similar to the finite case, , but for larger cardinalities even basic properties of the groups depend on delicate issues of set theory, some of which are exposed in . The <a href="nilpotent_group" title="wikilink">nilpotent groups</a> whose center is cyclic and derived subgroup has order <em>p</em> and whose conjugacy classes are at most countably infinite are classified in . Finite groups whose derived subgroup has order <em>p</em> are classified in .</p>
