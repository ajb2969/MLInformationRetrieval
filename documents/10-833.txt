(S)-scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a (S)-scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + (S)-scoulerine 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and (S)-scoulerine, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and (S)-tetrahydrocolumbamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:(S)-scoulerine 9-O-methyltransferase. This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i.
