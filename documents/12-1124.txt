   Weingarten equations      Weingarten equations   Weingarten equations give expansion of the derivative of the unit normal vector to a surface in terms of the first derivatives of the position vector of this surface . These formulas were established in 1861 by German mathematician Julius Weingarten . 1  Statement in classical differential geometry  Let S be a surface in three-dimensional Euclidean space that is parametrized by position vector r ( u , v ) of the surface. Let P = P ( u , v ) be a fixed point on this surface. Then        𝕣  u   =    ∂  𝕣    ∂  u     ,    𝕣  v   =    ∂  𝕣    ∂  v        formulae-sequence     subscript  𝕣  u       𝕣     u        subscript  𝕣  v       𝕣     v       \mathbb{r}_{u}=\frac{\partial\mathbb{r}}{\partial u},\quad\mathbb{r}_{v}=\frac%
 {\partial\mathbb{r}}{\partial v}     are two tangent vectors at point P .  Let n be the unit normal vector and let ( E , F , G ) and ( L , M , N ) be the coefficients of the first and second fundamental forms of this surface, respectively. The Weingarten equation gives the first derivative of the unit normal vector n at point P in terms of tangent vectors r u and r v :       𝕟  u   =       F  M   -   G  L      E  G   -   F  2      𝕣  u    +      F  L   -   E  M      E  G   -   F  2      𝕣  v          subscript  𝕟  u             F  M     G  L        E  G    superscript  F  2      subscript  𝕣  u            F  L     E  M        E  G    superscript  F  2      subscript  𝕣  v       \mathbb{n}_{u}=\frac{FM-GL}{EG-F^{2}}\mathbb{r}_{u}+\frac{FL-EM}{EG-F^{2}}%
