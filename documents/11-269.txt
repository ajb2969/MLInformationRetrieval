   Bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (symmetrical)      Bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (symmetrical)   In enzymology , a bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (symmetrical) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   P 1 ,P 4 -bis(5'-adenosyl) tetraphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 ADP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are P1,P4-bis(5'-adenosyl) tetraphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its product is ADP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is P1,P4-bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphate nucleosidebisphosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include diadenosinetetraphosphatase (symmetrical) , dinucleosidetetraphosphatasee (symmetrical) , symmetrical diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase , adenosine tetraphosphate phosphodiesterase , Ap4A hydrolase , bis(5'-adenosyl) tetraphosphatase , diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase , diadenosine polyphosphate hydrolase , diadenosine 5',5 -P1,P4-tetraphosphatase''', diadenosinetetraphosphatase (symmetrical) , 1-P,4-P-bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphate , and nucleosidebisphosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
