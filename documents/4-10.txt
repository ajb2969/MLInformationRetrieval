   Mahler's compactness theorem      Mahler's compactness theorem   In mathematics , Mahler's compactness theorem , proved by , is a foundational result on lattices in Euclidean space , characterising sets of lattices that are 'bounded' in a certain definite sense. Looked at another way, it explains the ways in which a lattice could degenerate ( go off to infinity ) in a sequence of lattices. In intuitive terms it says that this is possible in just two ways: becoming coarse-grained with a fundamental domain that has ever larger volume; or containing shorter and shorter vectors. It is also called his selection theorem , following an older convention used in naming compactness theorems, because they were formulated in terms of sequential compactness (the possibility of selecting a convergent subsequence).  Let X be the space         GL  n    (  ℝ  )    /   GL  n     (  ℤ  )            subscript  GL  n   ℝ    subscript  GL  n    ℤ    \mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{R})/\mathrm{GL}_{n}(\mathbb{Z})     that parametrises lattices in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , with its quotient topology . There is a well-defined function Δ on X , which is the absolute value of the determinant of a matrix – this is constant on the cosets , since an invertible integer matrix has determinant 1 or −1.  Mahler's compactness theorem states that a subset Y of X is relatively compact  if and only if Δ is bounded on Y , and there is a neighbourhood N of {0} in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   such that for all Λ in Y , the only lattice point of Λ in N is 0 itself.  The assertion of Mahler's theorem is equivalent to the compactness of the space of unit-covolume lattices in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   whose systole is larger or equal than any fixed    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   .  Mahler's compactness theorem was generalized to semisimple Lie groups by Mumford; see Mumford's compactness theorem .  References   William Andrew Coppel (2006), Number theory , p. 418.
