   Pompeiu derivative      Pompeiu derivative   In mathematical analysis , a Pompeiu derivative is a real-valued function of one real variable that is the derivative of an everywhere differentiable function and that vanishes in a dense set . In particular, a Pompeiu derivative is discontinuous at any point where it is not 0. Whether non-identically zero such functions may exist was a problem that arose in the context of early-1900s research on functional differentiability and integrability. The question was affirmatively answered by Dimitrie Pompeiu by constructing an explicit example; these functions are therefore named after him.  Pompeiu's construction  Pompeiu's construction is described here. Let    x  3       3   x    \sqrt[3]{x}   denote the real cubic root of the real number    x  .    x   x.   Let     {   q  j   }    j  ∈  𝒩      subscript    subscript  q  j      j  𝒩     \{q_{j}\}_{j\in\mathcal{N}}   be an enumeration of the rational numbers in the unit interval     [  0  ,  1  ]   .     0  1    [0,\,1].   Let     {   a  j   }    j  ∈  𝒩      subscript    subscript  a  j      j  𝒩     \{a_{j}\}_{j\in\mathcal{N}}   be positive real numbers with       ∑  j    a  j    <  ∞   .        subscript   j    subscript  a  j       \textstyle\sum_{j}a_{j}<\infty.   Define, for all    x  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]       x   0  1     x\in[0,\,1]           g   (  x  )    :=     ∑   j  =  0   ∞      a  j     x  -   q  j    3      .     assign    g  x     superscript   subscript     j  0         subscript  a  j      3     x   subscript  q  j         g(x):=\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\,a_{j}\sqrt[3]{x-q_{j}}.     Since for any    x  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]       x   0  1     x\in[0,\,1]   each term of the series is less than or equal to a j in absolute value, the series uniformly converges to a continuous, strictly increasing function g(x), due to the Weierstrass M-test . Moreover, it turns out that the function g is differentiable, with         g  ′    (  x  )    :=    1  3     ∑   j  =  0   ∞     a  j      (   x  -   q  j    )   2   3      >  0   ,       assign     superscript  g  normal-′   x       1  3     superscript   subscript     j  0         subscript  a  j      3    superscript    x   subscript  q  j    2            0     g^{\prime}(x):=\frac{1}{3}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{a_{j}}{\sqrt[3]{(x-q_{j})^{%
 2}}}>0,   at any point where the sum is finite; also, at all other points, in particular, at any of the     q  j   ,     subscript  q  j    q_{j},   one has       g  ′    (  x  )    :=   +  ∞    .     assign     superscript  g  normal-′   x         \textstyle g^{\prime}(x):=+\infty.   Since the image of   g   g   g   is a closed bounded interval with left endpoint     0  =   g   (  0  )     ,      0    g  0     0=g(0),   up to a multiplicative constant factor one can assume that g maps the interval    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,\,1]   onto itself. Since g is strictly increasing, it is a homeomorphism; and by the theorem of differentiation of the inverse function, its composition inverse      f   :=   g   -  1       assign  f   superscript  g    1      f\,:=g^{-1}   has a finite derivative at any point, which vanishes at least in the points      {   g   (   q  j   )    }    j  ∈  𝒩    .     subscript     g   subscript  q  j       j  𝒩     \{g(q_{j})\}_{j\in\mathcal{N}}.   These form a dense subset of    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,\,1]   (actually, it vanishes in many other points; see below).  Properties   It is known that the zero-set of a derivative of any everywhere differentiable function is a G δ subset of the real line. By definition, for any Pompeiu function this set is a dense G δ set, therefore by the Baire category theorem it is a residual set . In particular, it possesses uncountably many points.  A linear combination af ( x ) + bg ( x ) of Pompeiu functions is a derivative, and vanishes on the set { f = 0} ∩ { g = 0}, which is a dense G δ by the Baire category theorem. Thus, Pompeiu functions are a vector space of functions.  A limit function of a uniformly convergent sequence of Pompeiu derivatives is a Pompeiou derivative. Indeed, it is a derivative, due to the theorem of limit under the sign of derivative. Moreover, it vanishes in the intersection of the zero sets of the functions of the sequences: since these are dense G δ sets, the zero set of the limit function is also dense.  As a consequence, the class E of all bounded Pompeiu derivatives on an interval [ a , b ] is a closed linear subspace of the Banach space of all bounded functions under the uniform distance (hence, it is a Banach space).  Pompeiu's above construction of a positive function is a rather peculiar example of a Pompeiu's function: a theorem of Weil states that generically a Pompeiu derivative assumes both positive and negative values in dense sets, in the precise meaning that such functions constitute a residual set of the Banach space E .
