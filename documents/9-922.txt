   Percus‚ÄìYevick approximation      Percus‚ÄìYevick approximation   In statistical mechanics the Percus‚ÄìYevick approximation 1 is a closure relation to solve the Ornstein‚ÄìZernike equation . It is also referred to as the Percus‚ÄìYevick equation . It is commonly used in fluid theory to obtain e.g. expressions for the radial distribution function .  Derivation  The direct correlation function represents the direct correlation between two particles in a system containing N ‚àí¬†2 other particles. It can be represented by       c   (  r  )    =     g  total    (  r  )    -    g  indirect    (  r  )           c  r        subscript  g  total   r      subscript  g  indirect   r      c(r)=g_{\rm total}(r)-g_{\rm indirect}(r)\,     where     g  total    (  r  )        subscript  g  total   r    g_{\rm total}(r)   is the radial distribution function , i.e.     g   (  r  )    =   exp   [   -   Œ≤  w   (  r  )     ]          g  r         Œ≤  w  r       g(r)=\exp[-\beta w(r)]   (with w ( r ) the potential of mean force ) and     g  indirect    (  r  )        subscript  g  indirect   r    g_{\rm indirect}(r)   is the radial distribution function without the direct interaction between pairs    u   (  r  )       u  r    u(r)   included; i.e. we write      g  indirect    (  r  )    =   exp   -   Œ≤   [    w   (  r  )    -   u   (  r  )     ]             subscript  g  indirect   r    superscript       Œ≤   delimited-[]      w  r     u  r          g_{\rm indirect}(r)=\exp^{-\beta[w(r)-u(r)]}   . Thus we approximate  c ( r ) by        c   (  r  )    =    e   -   Œ≤  w   (  r  )      -   e   -   Œ≤   [    w   (  r  )    -   u   (  r  )     ]        .        c  r      superscript  e      Œ≤  w  r      superscript  e      Œ≤   delimited-[]      w  r     u  r           c(r)=e^{-\beta w(r)}-e^{-\beta[w(r)-u(r)]}.\,     If we introduce the function     y   (  r  )    =    e   Œ≤  u   (  r  )     g   (  r  )          y  r      superscript  e    Œ≤  u  r    g  r     y(r)=e^{\beta u(r)}g(r)   into the approximation for c ( r ) one obtains        c   (  r  )    =    g   (  r  )    -   y   (  r  )     =     e   -   Œ≤  u     y   (  r  )    -   y   (  r  )     =   f   (  r  )   y   (  r  )     .          c  r       g  r     y  r              superscript  e      Œ≤  u     y  r     y  r           f  r  y  r      c(r)=g(r)-y(r)=e^{-\beta u}y(r)-y(r)=f(r)y(r).\,     This is the essence of the Percus‚ÄìYevick approximation for if we substitute this result in the Ornstein‚ÄìZernike equation , one obtains the Percus‚ÄìYevick equation :        y   (   r  12   )    =   1  +   œÅ   ‚à´   f   (   r  13   )   y   (   r  13   )   h   (   r  23   )   d   ùê´  ùüë        .        y   subscript  r  12      1    œÅ      f   subscript  r  13   y   subscript  r  13   h   subscript  r  23   d   subscript  ùê´  3         y(r_{12})=1+\rho\int f(r_{13})y(r_{13})h(r_{23})d\mathbf{r_{3}}.\,     The approximation was defined by Percus and Yevick in 1958. For hard spheres , the equation has an analytical solution. 2  See also   Hypernetted chain equation ‚Äî another closure relation   References  External links   Exact solution of the Percus Yevick integral equation for hard spheres   "  Category:Statistical mechanics     Percus, Jerome K. and Yevick, George J.
