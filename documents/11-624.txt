Maltose-6'-phosphate glucosidase

In enzymology, a maltose-6'-phosphate glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

maltose 6'-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + D-glucose 6-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are maltose-6'-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucose and D-glucose 6-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is maltose-6'-phosphate 6-phosphoglucohydrolase. This enzyme is also called phospho-alpha-glucosidase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
