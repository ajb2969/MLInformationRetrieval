The tessellation fills space by 7-simplex, truncated 7-simplex, bitruncated 7-simplex, and tritruncated 7-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 1:1:1:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.
It can be constructed by eight sets of parallel hyperplanes that divide space. The hyperplane intersections generate cyclotruncated 6-simplex honeycomb divisions on each hyperplane.
