   Semi-elliptic operator      Semi-elliptic operator   In mathematics — specifically, in the theory of partial differential equations — a semi-elliptic operator is a partial differential operator satisfying a positivity condition slightly weaker than that of being an elliptic operator . Every elliptic operator is also semi-elliptic, and semi-elliptic operators share many of the nice properties of elliptic operators: for example, much of the same existence and uniqueness theory is applicable, and semi-elliptic Dirichlet problems can be solved using the methods of stochastic analysis .  Definition  A second-order partial differential operator  P defined on an open subset Ω of n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n , acting on suitable functions f by        P  f   (  x  )    =     ∑    i  ,  j   =  1   n     a   i  j     (  x  )      ∂  2   f     ∂    x  i      ∂   x  j       (  x  )     +    ∑   i  =  1   n     b  i    (  x  )     ∂  f    ∂   x  i      (  x  )     +   c   (  x  )   f   (  x  )      ,        P  f  x       superscript   subscript      i  j   1    n      subscript  a    i  j    x      superscript   2   f        subscript  x  i       subscript  x  j      x      superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  b  i   x      f      subscript  x  i     x      c  x  f  x      Pf(x)=\sum_{i,j=1}^{n}a_{ij}(x)\frac{\partial^{2}f}{\partial x_{i}\,\partial x%
 _{j}}(x)+\sum_{i=1}^{n}b_{i}(x)\frac{\partial f}{\partial x_{i}}(x)+c(x)f(x),     is said to be semi-elliptic if all the eigenvalues  λ i ( x ), 1 ≤ i ≤ n , of the matrix  a ( x ) = ( a ij ( x )) are non-negative. (By way of contrast, P is said to be elliptic if λ i ( x ) > 0 for all x ∈ Ω and 1 ≤ i ≤ n , and uniformly elliptic if the eigenvalues are uniformly bounded away from zero, uniformly in i and x .) Equivalently, P is semi-elliptic if the matrix a ( x ) is positive semi-definite for each x ∈ Ω.
