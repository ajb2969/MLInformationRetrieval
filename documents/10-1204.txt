   D-mannitol oxidase      D-mannitol oxidase   In enzymology , a D-mannitol oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   mannitol + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   mannose + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are mannitol and O 2 , whereas its two products are mannose and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is mannitol:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing) . Other names in common use include mannitol oxidase , and D-arabitol oxidase .
