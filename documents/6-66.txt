   Thermodynamic beta      Thermodynamic beta   In statistical mechanics , the thermodynamic beta (or occasionally perk ) is the reciprocal of the thermodynamic temperature of a system. It can be calculated in the microcanonical ensemble from the formula       β  ≜    1   k  B      (    ∂  S    ∂  E    )    V  ,  N     =    1    k  B   T      ,       normal-≜  β      1   subscript  k  B     subscript      S     E     V  N            1     subscript  k  B   T       \beta\triangleq\frac{1}{k_{B}}\left(\frac{\partial S}{\partial E}\right)_{V,N}%
 =\frac{1}{k_{B}T}\,,   where k B is the Boltzmann constant , S is the entropy , E is the energy , V is the volume, N is the particle number, and T is the absolute temperature. It has units reciprocal to that of energy; in units where k B =1 it also has units reciprocal to that of temperature. Thermodynamic beta is essentially the connection between the information theoretic / statistical interpretation of a physical system through its entropy and the thermodynamics associated with its energy. It express the response of entropy to an increase in energy. If a system is challenged with a small amount of energy, then β describes the amount by which the system will "perk up," i.e. randomize. Though completely equivalent in conceptual content to temperature, β is generally considered a more fundamental quantity than temperature owing to the phenomenon of negative temperature , in which β is continuous as it crosses zero whereas T has a singularity. 1  Details  Statistical interpretation  From the statistical point of view, β is a numerical quantity relating two macroscopic systems in equilibrium. The exact formulation is as follows. Consider two systems, 1 and 2, in thermal contact, with respective energies E 1 and E 2 . We assume E 1 + E 2 = some constant E . The number of microstates of each system will be denoted by Ω 1 and Ω 2 . Under our assumptions Ω i depends only on E i . Thus the number of microstates for the combined system is       Ω  =    Ω  1    (   E  1   )    Ω  2    (   E  2   )    =    Ω  1    (   E  1   )    Ω  2    (   E  -   E  1    )     .        normal-Ω     subscript  normal-Ω  1    subscript  E  1    subscript  normal-Ω  2    subscript  E  2            subscript  normal-Ω  1    subscript  E  1    subscript  normal-Ω  2     E   subscript  E  1        \Omega=\Omega_{1}(E_{1})\Omega_{2}(E_{2})=\Omega_{1}(E_{1})\Omega_{2}(E-E_{1}).\,     We will derive β from the fundamental assumption of statistical mechanics :   When the combined system reaches equilibrium, the number Ω is maximized.    (In other words, the system naturally seeks the maximum number of microstates.) Therefore, at equilibrium,        d   d   E  1     Ω   =     Ω  2    (   E  2   )    d   d   E  1      Ω  1    (   E  1   )    +     Ω  1    (   E  1   )    d   d   E  2      Ω  2    (   E  2   )    ⋅    d   E  2     d   E  1       =  0.            d    d   subscript  E  1     normal-Ω        subscript  normal-Ω  2    subscript  E  2     d    d   subscript  E  1      subscript  normal-Ω  1    subscript  E  1     normal-⋅     subscript  normal-Ω  1    subscript  E  1     d    d   subscript  E  2      subscript  normal-Ω  2    subscript  E  2        d   subscript  E  2      d   subscript  E  1            0.     \frac{d}{dE_{1}}\Omega=\Omega_{2}(E_{2})\frac{d}{dE_{1}}\Omega_{1}(E_{1})+%
 \Omega_{1}(E_{1})\frac{d}{dE_{2}}\Omega_{2}(E_{2})\cdot\frac{dE_{2}}{dE_{1}}=0.     But E 1 + E 2 = E implies        d   E  2     d   E  1     =   -  1.           d   subscript  E  2      d   subscript  E  1       1.     \frac{dE_{2}}{dE_{1}}=-1.     So         Ω  2    (   E  2   )    d   d   E  1      Ω  1    (   E  1   )    -    Ω  1    (   E  1   )    d   d   E  2      Ω  2    (   E  2   )     =  0           subscript  normal-Ω  2    subscript  E  2     d    d   subscript  E  1      subscript  normal-Ω  1    subscript  E  1       subscript  normal-Ω  1    subscript  E  1     d    d   subscript  E  2      subscript  normal-Ω  2    subscript  E  2     0    \Omega_{2}(E_{2})\frac{d}{dE_{1}}\Omega_{1}(E_{1})-\Omega_{1}(E_{1})\frac{d}{%
 dE_{2}}\Omega_{2}(E_{2})=0     i.e.        d   d   E  1      ln   Ω  1     =     d   d   E  2      ln   Ω  2     at equilibrium.           d    d   subscript  E  1        subscript  normal-Ω  1          d    d   subscript  E  2        subscript  normal-Ω  2     at equilibrium.     \frac{d}{dE_{1}}\ln\Omega_{1}=\frac{d}{dE_{2}}\ln\Omega_{2}\quad\mbox{at %
 equilibrium.}     The above relation motivates a definition of β :       β  =    d   ln  Ω     d  E     .      β      d    normal-Ω      d  E      \beta=\frac{d\ln\Omega}{dE}.     Connection of statistical view with thermodynamic view  When two systems are in equilibrium, they have the same thermodynamic temperature  T . Thus intuitively, one would expect β (as defined via microstates) to be related to T in some way. This link is provided by Boltzmann's fundamental assumption written as       S  =    k  B    ln  Ω     ,      S     subscript  k  B     normal-Ω      S=k_{B}\ln\Omega,\,     where k B is the Boltzmann constant and S is the classical thermodynamic entropy. So        d   ln  Ω    =    1   k  B    d  S    .        d    normal-Ω        1   subscript  k  B    d  S     d\ln\Omega=\frac{1}{k_{B}}dS.     Substituting into the definition of β gives       β  =    1   k  B      d  S    d  E      .      β      1   subscript  k  B        d  S     d  E       \beta=\frac{1}{k_{B}}\frac{dS}{dE}.     Comparing with the thermodynamic formula         d  S    d  E    =   1  T    ,          d  S     d  E      1  T     \frac{dS}{dE}=\frac{1}{T},     we have      β  =   1    k  B   T    =   1  τ         β    1     subscript  k  B   T           1  τ      \beta=\frac{1}{k_{B}T}=\frac{1}{\tau}     where   τ   τ   \tau   is called the fundamental temperature of the system, and has units of energy.
