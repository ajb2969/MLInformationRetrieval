   Carotene 7,8-desaturase      Carotene 7,8-desaturase   In enzymology , a carotene 7,8-desaturase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   neurosporene + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   lycopene + A + 2 H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are neurosporene , an electron acceptor AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are lycopene , the reduction product A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carotene,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called zeta-carotene desaturase . This enzyme participates in carotenoid biosynthesis - general .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
