C-normal subgroup

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a subgroup

 
  of a group

 
  is called c-normal if there is a normal subgroup

 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and the intersection of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  lies inside the normal core of 
 
 
 
 .
For a weakly c-normal subgroup, we only require 
 
 
 
  to be subnormal.
Here are some facts on c-normal subgroups:

Every normal subgroup is c-normal
Every retract is c-normal
Every c-normal subgroup is weakly c-normal
