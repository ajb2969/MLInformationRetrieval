   C-normal subgroup      C-normal subgroup   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a subgroup    H   H   H   of a group    G   G   G   is called c-normal if there is a normal subgroup    T   T   T   of   G   G   G   such that     H  T   =  G        H  T   G    HT=G   and the intersection of   H   H   H   and   T   T   T   lies inside the normal core of   H   H   H   .  For a weakly c-normal subgroup , we only require   T   T   T   to be subnormal .  Here are some facts on c-normal subgroups:   Every normal subgroup is c-normal  Every retract is c-normal  Every c-normal subgroup is weakly c-normal   References   Y.
