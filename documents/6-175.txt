   Bunching parameter      Bunching parameter   In statistics as applied in particular in particle physics , when fluctuations of some observables are measured, it is convenient to transform the multiplicity distribution to the bunching parameters :        η  q   =    q   q  -  1       P  q    P   q  -  2      P   q  -  1   2      ,       subscript  η  q       q    q  1         subscript  P  q    subscript  P    q  2      superscript   subscript  P    q  1    2       \eta_{q}=\frac{q}{q-1}\frac{P_{q}P_{q-2}}{P_{q-1}^{2}},   where    P  n     subscript  P  n    P_{n}   is probability of observing   n   n   n   objects inside of some phase space regions. The bunching parameters measure deviations of the multiplicity distribution    P  n     subscript  P  n    P_{n}   from a Poisson distribution , since for this distribution       η  q   =  1       subscript  η  q   1    \eta_{q}=1   .  Uncorrelated particle production leads to the Poisson statistics , thus deviations of the bunching parameters from the Poisson values mean correlations between particles and dynamical fluctuations.  Normalised factorial moments have also similar properties. They are defined as        F  q   =     ⟨  n  ⟩    -  q      ∑   n  =  q   ∞      n  !     (   n  -  q   )   !     P  n       .       subscript  F  q      superscript   delimited-⟨⟩  n     q      subscript   superscript       n  q          n       n  q      subscript  P  n        F_{q}=\langle n\rangle^{-q}\sum^{\infty}_{n=q}\frac{n!}{(n-q)!}P_{n}.     Numeric implementation  Bunching parameters and normalized factorial moments are included to the DataMelt program for data analysis and scientific computing.
