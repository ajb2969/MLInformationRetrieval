   Homotopy excision theorem      Homotopy excision theorem   In algebraic topology , the homotopy excision theorem offers a substitute for the absence of excision in homotopy theory . More precisely, let    (  X  ;  A  ,  B  )     X  A  B    (X;A,B)   be an excisive triad with    C  =   A  ∩  B       C    A  B     C=A\cap B   nonempty, and suppose the pair    (  A  ,  C  )     A  C    (A,C)   is (    m  -  1      m  1    m-1   )-connected ,    m  ≥  2      m  2    m\geq 2   , and the pair    (  B  ,  C  )     B  C    (B,C)   is (    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   )-connected,    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   . Then the map induced by the inclusion    i  :    (  A  ,  C  )   →   (  X  ,  B  )       normal-:  i   normal-→   A  C    X  B      i:(A,C)\to(X,B)          i  *   :     π  q    (  A  ,  C  )    →    π  q    (  X  ,  B  )        normal-:   subscript  i     normal-→     subscript  π  q    A  C       subscript  π  q    X  B       i_{*}:\pi_{q}(A,C)\to\pi_{q}(X,B)   is bijective for    q  <    m  +  n   -  2       q      m  n   2     q   and is surjective for    q  =    m  +  n   -  2       q      m  n   2     q=m+n-2   .  A nice geometric proof is given in the book by tom Dieck. 1  This result should also be seen as a consequence of the Blakers–Massey theorem , the most general form of which, dealing with the non-simply-connected case. 2  The most important consequence is the Freudenthal suspension theorem .
