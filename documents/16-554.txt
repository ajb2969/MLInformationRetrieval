Homotopy excision theorem

In algebraic topology, the homotopy excision theorem offers a substitute for the absence of excision in homotopy theory. More precisely, let 
 
 
 
  be an excisive triad with 
 
 
 
  nonempty, and suppose the pair 
 
 
 
  is (
 
 
 
 )-connected, 
 
 
 
 , and the pair 
 
 
 
  is (
 
 
 
 )-connected, 
 
 
 
 . Then the map induced by the inclusion 
 
 



 
  is bijective for 
 
 
 
  and is surjective for 
 
 
 
 .
A nice geometric proof is given in the book by tom Dieck.1
This result should also be seen as a consequence of the Blakers–Massey theorem, the most general form of which, dealing with the non-simply-connected case.2
The most important consequence is the Freudenthal suspension theorem.
