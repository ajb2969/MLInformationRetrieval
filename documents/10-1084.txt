   Latia-luciferin monooxygenase (demethylating)      Latia-luciferin monooxygenase (demethylating)   In enzymology , a Latia-luciferin monooxygenase (demethylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   Latia luciferin + AH 2 + 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxidized Latia luciferin + CO 2 + formate + A + H 2 O + hnu   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are Latia luciferin , an electron acceptor AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 6 products are oxidized Latia luciferin , CO 2 , formate , the reduction product A, H 2 O , and h n .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is Latia-luciferin,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (demethylating) . Other names in common use include luciferase (Latia luciferin) , and Latia luciferin monooxygenase (demethylating) . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Flavoprotein .
