Coniferin beta-glucosidase




Coniferin beta-glucosidase

In enzymology, a coniferin beta-glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

coniferin + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + coniferol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are coniferin and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucose and coniferol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is coniferin beta-D-glucosidase. This enzyme is also called coniferin-hydrolyzing beta-glucosidase. This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.
