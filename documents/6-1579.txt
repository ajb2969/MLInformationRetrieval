   Verma module      Verma module   Verma modules , named after Daya-Nand Verma , are objects in the representation theory of Lie algebras , a branch of mathematics .  Verma modules can be used to prove that an irreducible highest weight module with highest weight    λ   λ   \lambda   is finite-dimensional , if and only if the weight   λ   λ   \lambda   is dominant and integral. Their homomorphisms correspond to invariant differential operators over flag manifolds .  Definition of Verma modules  The definition relies on a stack of relatively dense notation. Let   F   F   F   be a field and denote the following:      𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , a semisimple Lie algebra over   F   F   F   , with universal enveloping algebra     𝒰   (  𝔤  )       𝒰  𝔤    \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})   .     𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   , a Borel subalgebra of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , with universal enveloping algebra    𝒰   (  𝔟  )       𝒰  𝔟    \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{b})   .     𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   , a Cartan subalgebra of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . We do not consider its universal enveloping algebra.      λ  ∈   𝔥  *       λ   superscript  𝔥      \lambda\in\mathfrak{h}^{*}   , a fixed weight .   To define the Verma module, we begin by defining some other modules:       F  λ     subscript  F  λ    F_{\lambda}   , the one-dimensional   F   F   F   -vector space (i.e. whose underlying set is   F   F   F   itself) together with a   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   - module structure such that   𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   acts as multiplication by   λ   λ   \lambda   and the positive root spaces act trivially. As    F  λ     subscript  F  λ    F_{\lambda}   is a left   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   -module, it is consequently a left    𝒰   (  𝔟  )       𝒰  𝔟    \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{b})   -module.  Using the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem , there is a natural right    𝒰   (  𝔟  )       𝒰  𝔟    \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{b})   -module structure on    𝒰   (  𝔤  )       𝒰  𝔤    \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})   by right multiplication of a subalgebra.    𝒰   (  𝔤  )       𝒰  𝔤    \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})   is naturally a left   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module, and together with this structure, it is a    (  𝔤  ,   𝒰   (  𝔟  )    )     𝔤    𝒰  𝔟     (\mathfrak{g},\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{b}))   - bimodule .   Now we can define the Verma module (with respect to   λ   λ   \lambda   ) as       M  λ   =    𝒰   (  𝔤  )     ⊗   𝒰   (  𝔟  )      F  λ         subscript  M  λ     subscript  tensor-product    𝒰  𝔟      𝒰  𝔤    subscript  F  λ      M_{\lambda}=\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})\otimes_{\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{b})}F_{\lambda}   which is naturally a left   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module (i.e. a representation of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   ). The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem implies that the underlying vector space of    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   is isomorphic to       𝒰   (   𝔤  -   )     ⊗  F    F  λ       subscript  tensor-product  F     𝒰   subscript  𝔤      subscript  F  λ     \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g}_{-})\otimes_{F}F_{\lambda}   where    𝔤  -     subscript  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}_{-}   is the Lie subalgebra generated by the negative root spaces of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   .  Basic properties  Verma modules, considered as   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   - modules , are highest weight modules , i.e. they are generated by a highest weight vector . This highest weight vector is    1  ⊗  1     tensor-product  1  1    1\otimes 1   (the first   1   1   1   is the unit in    𝒰   (  𝔤  )       𝒰  𝔤    \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})   and the second is the unit in the field   F   F   F   , considered as the   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   - module     F  λ     subscript  F  λ    F_{\lambda}   ) and it has weight   λ   λ   \lambda   .  Verma modules are weight modules , i.e.    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   is a direct sum of all its weight spaces . Each weight space in    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   is finite-dimensional and the dimension of the   μ   μ   \mu   -weight space    M  μ     subscript  M  μ    M_{\mu}   is the number of possibilities how to obtain    λ  -  μ      λ  μ    \lambda-\mu   as a sum of positive roots (this is closely related to the so-called Kostant partition function ).  Verma modules have a very important property: If   V   V   V   is any representation generated by a highest weight vector of weight   λ   λ   \lambda   , there is a surjective    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   - homomorphism       M  λ   →  V   .     normal-→   subscript  M  λ   V    M_{\lambda}\to V.   That is, all representations with highest weight   λ   λ   \lambda   that are generated by the highest weight vector (so called highest weight modules ) are quotients of     M  λ   .     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}.       M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   contains a unique maximal submodule , and its quotient is the unique (up to isomorphism ) irreducible representation with highest weight    λ  .    λ   \lambda.     The Verma module    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   itself is irreducible if and only if none of the coordinates of   λ   λ   \lambda   in the basis of fundamental weights is from the set    {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  }     0  1  2  normal-…    \{0,1,2,\ldots\}   .  The Verma module    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   is called regular , if its highest weight λ is on the affine Weyl orbit of a dominant weight    λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   . In other word, there exist an element w of the Weyl group W such that      λ  =   w  ⋅   λ  ~        λ   normal-⋅  w   normal-~  λ      \lambda=w\cdot\tilde{\lambda}   where   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   is the affine action of the Weyl group.  The Verma module    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   is called singular , if there is no dominant weight on the affine orbit of λ. In this case, there exists a weight    λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   so that     λ  ~   +  δ       normal-~  λ   δ    \tilde{\lambda}+\delta   is on the wall of the fundamental Weyl chamber (δ is the sum of all fundamental weights ).  Homomorphisms of Verma modules  For any two weights    λ  ,  μ     λ  μ    \lambda,\mu   a non-trivial homomorphism       M  μ   →   M  λ      normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     M_{\mu}\rightarrow M_{\lambda}     may exist only if   μ   μ   \mu   and   λ   λ   \lambda   are linked with an affine action of the Weyl group    W   W   W   of the Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . This follows easily from the Harish-Chandra theorem on infinitesimal central characters .  Each homomorphism of Verma modules is injective and the dimension       dim   (   Hom   (   M  μ   ,   M  λ   )    )    ≤  1       dimension   Hom   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     1    \dim(\operatorname{Hom}(M_{\mu},M_{\lambda}))\leq 1     for any    μ  ,  λ     μ  λ    \mu,\lambda   . So, there exists a nonzero     M  μ   →   M  λ      normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     M_{\mu}\rightarrow M_{\lambda}   if and only if    M  μ     subscript  M  μ    M_{\mu}   is isomorphic to a (unique) submodule of    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   .  The full classification of Verma module homomorphisms was done by Bernstein-Gelfand-Gelfand 1 and Verma 2 and can be summed up in the following statement:   There exists a nonzero homomorphism     M  μ   →   M  λ      normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     M_{\mu}\rightarrow M_{\lambda}   if and only if there exists a sequence of weights        μ  =   ν  0   ≤   ν  1   ≤  …  ≤   ν  k   =  λ        μ   subscript  ν  0         subscript  ν  1        normal-…        subscript  ν  k        λ     \mu=\nu_{0}\leq\nu_{1}\leq\ldots\leq\nu_{k}=\lambda        such that      ν   i  -  1    +  δ   =    s   γ  i     (    ν  i   +  δ   )           subscript  ν    i  1    δ      subscript  s   subscript  γ  i       subscript  ν  i   δ      \nu_{i-1}+\delta=s_{\gamma_{i}}(\nu_{i}+\delta)   for some positive roots    γ  i     subscript  γ  i    \gamma_{i}   (and    s   γ  i      subscript  s   subscript  γ  i     s_{\gamma_{i}}   is the corresponding root reflection and   δ   δ   \delta   is the sum of all fundamental weights ) and for each     1  ≤  i  ≤  k   ,    (    ν  i   +  δ   )    (   H   γ  i    )       formulae-sequence      1  i       k         subscript  ν  i   δ    subscript  H   subscript  γ  i       1\leq i\leq k,(\nu_{i}+\delta)(H_{\gamma_{i}})   is a natural number (    H   γ  i      subscript  H   subscript  γ  i     H_{\gamma_{i}}   is the coroot associated to the root    γ  i     subscript  γ  i    \gamma_{i}   ).   If the Verma modules    M  μ     subscript  M  μ    M_{\mu}   and    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   are regular , then there exists a unique dominant weight     λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   and unique elements w , w ′ of the Weyl group  W such that   P    μ  =    w  ′   ⋅   λ  ~        μ   normal-⋅   superscript  w  normal-′    normal-~  λ      \mu=w^{\prime}\cdot\tilde{\lambda}      and       λ  =   w  ⋅   λ  ~     ,      λ   normal-⋅  w   normal-~  λ      \lambda=w\cdot\tilde{\lambda},     where   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   is the affine action of the Weyl group. If the weights are further integral , then there exists a nonzero homomorphism       M  μ   →   M  λ      normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     M_{\mu}\to M_{\lambda}     if and only if      w  ≤   w  ′       w   superscript  w  normal-′     w\leq w^{\prime}     in the Bruhat ordering of the Weyl group.  Jordan–Hölder series  Let      0  ⊂  A  ⊂  B  ⊂   M  λ         0  A       B        subscript  M  λ      0\subset A\subset B\subset M_{\lambda}   be a sequence of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -modules so that the quotient B/A is irreducible with highest weight μ. Then there exists a nonzero homomorphism     M  μ   →   M  λ      normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     M_{\mu}\to M_{\lambda}   .  An easy consequence of this is, that for any highest weight modules      V  μ   ,   V  λ       subscript  V  μ    subscript  V  λ     V_{\mu},V_{\lambda}   such that       V  μ   ⊂   V  λ        subscript  V  μ    subscript  V  λ     V_{\mu}\subset V_{\lambda}   there exists a nonzero homomorphism     M  μ   →   M  λ      normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     M_{\mu}\to M_{\lambda}   .  Bernstein–Gelfand–Gelfand resolution  Let    V  λ     subscript  V  λ    V_{\lambda}   be a finite-dimensional irreducible representation of the Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   with highest weight λ. We know from the section about homomorphisms of Verma modules that there exists a homomorphism       M    w  ′   ⋅  λ    →   M   w  ⋅  λ       normal-→   subscript  M   normal-⋅   superscript  w  normal-′   λ     subscript  M   normal-⋅  w  λ      M_{w^{\prime}\cdot\lambda}\to M_{w\cdot\lambda}     if and only if      w  ≤   w  ′       w   superscript  w  normal-′     w\leq w^{\prime}     in the Bruhat ordering of the Weyl group . The following theorem describes a resolution of    V  λ     subscript  V  λ    V_{\lambda}   in terms of Verma modules (it was proved by Bernstein – Gelfand – Gelfand in 1975 3 ) :   There exists an exact sequence of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -homomorphisms      0  →    ⊕    w  ∈  W   ,    ℓ   (  w  )    =  n      M   w  ⋅  λ     →  ⋯  →    ⊕    w  ∈  W   ,    ℓ   (  w  )    =  2      M   w  ⋅  λ     →    ⊕    w  ∈  W   ,    ℓ   (  w  )    =  1      M   w  ⋅  λ     →   M  λ   →   V  λ   →  0       normal-→  0    subscript  direct-sum   formulae-sequence    w  W       normal-ℓ  w   n      subscript  M   normal-⋅  w  λ       normal-→    normal-⋯    normal-→      subscript  direct-sum   formulae-sequence    w  W       normal-ℓ  w   2      subscript  M   normal-⋅  w  λ       normal-→      subscript  direct-sum   formulae-sequence    w  W       normal-ℓ  w   1      subscript  M   normal-⋅  w  λ       normal-→     subscript  M  λ     normal-→     subscript  V  λ     normal-→    0     0\to\oplus_{w\in W,\,\,\ell(w)=n}M_{w\cdot\lambda}\to\cdots\to\oplus_{w\in W,%
 \,\,\ell(w)=2}M_{w\cdot\lambda}\to\oplus_{w\in W,\,\,\ell(w)=1}M_{w\cdot%
 \lambda}\to M_{\lambda}\to V_{\lambda}\to 0   where n is the length of the largest element of the Weyl group.   A similar resolution exists for generalized Verma modules as well. It is denoted shortly as the BGG resolution .  Recently, these resolutions were studied in special cases, because of their connections to invariant differential operators in a special type of Cartan geometry , the parabolic geometries . These are Cartan geometries modeled on the pair ( G , P ) where G is a Lie group and P a parabolic subgroup ). 4  See also   Generalized Verma module  Weyl module   Notes  References    .   .   .   .    .
