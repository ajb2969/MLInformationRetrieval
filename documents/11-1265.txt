Gibberellin beta-D-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a gibberellin beta-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + gibberellin 
 
 
 
  UDP + gibberellin 2-O-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and gibberellin, whereas its two products are UDP and gibberellin 2-O-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:gibberellin 2-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-gibberellate 7-glucosyltransferase, and uridine diphosphoglucose-gibberellate 3-O-glucosyltransferase.
