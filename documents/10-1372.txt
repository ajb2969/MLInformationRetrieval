   Acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme      Acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme   In enzymology , an acetylacetone-cleaving enzyme () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pentane-2,4-dione + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + 2-oxopropanal   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are pentane-2,4-dione and O 2 , whereas its two products are acetate and 2-oxopropanal .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetylacetone:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include Dke1 , acetylacetone dioxygenase , diketone cleaving dioxygenase , and diketone cleaving enzyme .
