   SVJ      SVJ   SVJ or the Stochastic Volatility Jump model is a model suggested by Bates . This is a model that fits the observed implied volatility surface well. The model is a Heston process with an added Merton log-normal jump.  Model  The model is originally proposed by Bates (1996) assumes the following correlated processes:       d  S   =    μ   S   d  t   +    ν    S   d   Z  1    +    (    e   α  +   δ  ϵ     -  1   )   S  d  q          d  S       μ  S  d  t       ν   S  d   subscript  Z  1         superscript  e    α    δ  ϵ     1   S  d  q      dS=\mu S\,dt+\sqrt{\nu}S\,dZ_{1}+(e^{\alpha+\delta\epsilon}-1)Sdq        d  ν   =    -   λ   (   ν  -   ν  ¯    )   d  t    +   η   ν   d   Z  2           d  ν         λ    ν   normal-¯  ν    d  t      η    ν   d   subscript  Z  2       d\nu=-\lambda(\nu-\overline{\nu})dt+\eta\sqrt{\nu}dZ_{2}        corr   (   d   Z  1    ,   d   Z  2    )    =  ρ       corr    d   subscript  Z  1      d   subscript  Z  2     ρ    \operatorname{corr}(dZ_{1},dZ_{2})=\rho     "  Category:Mathematical finance
