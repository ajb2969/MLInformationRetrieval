Cauchy–Hadamard theorem
In [[mathematics]], the '''Cauchy–Hadamard theorem''' is a result in [[complex analysis]] named after the [[France|French]] [[mathematician]]s [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]] and [[Jacques Hadamard]], describing the [[radius of convergence]] of a [[power series]]. It was published in 1821 by Cauchy,{{citation|first=A. L.|last=Cauchy|authorlink=Augustin Louis Cauchy|title=Analyse algébrique|year=1821}}. but remained relatively unknown until Hadamard rediscovered it.{{citation|title=The Higher Calculus: A History of Real and Complex Analysis fro
 m Euler to Weierstrass|first=Umberto|last=Bottazzini|publisher=Springer-Verlag|year=1986|isbn=978-0-387-96302-0|pages=116–117}}. Translated from the Italian by Warren Van Egmond. Hadamard's first publication of this result was in 1888;1 he also included it as part of his 1892 Ph.D. thesis.2
Theory for one complex variable
Statement of the theorem
Consider the formal power series in one complex variable z of the form



where 
 
 

Then the radius of convergence of ƒ at the point a is given by



where lim sup denotes the limit superior, the limit as n approaches infinity of the supremum of the sequence values after the nth position. If the sequence values are unbounded so that the lim sup is ∞, then the power series does not converge near a, while if the lim sup is 0 then the radius of convergence is ∞, meaning that the series converges on the entire plane.
Proof of the theorem
3 Without loss of generality assume that 
 
 
 
 . We will show first that the power series 
 
 
 
  converges for 
 
 
 
 .
First suppose 
 
 
 
  not be zero or ±infinity. For any 
 
 
 
 , there exists only a finite number of 
 
 
 
  such that

 
 . Now 
 
 
 
  for all but a finite number of 
 
 
 
 , so the series 
 
 
 
  converges if 
 
 
 
 . This proves the first part.
Conversely, for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for infinitely many 
 
 
 
 , so if 
 
 
 
 , we see that the series cannot converge because its nth term does not tend to 0. Quod erat demonstrandum.
Several complex variables
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a multi-index (a n-tuple of integers) with 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  converges with radius of convergence 
 
 
 
  (which is also a multi-index) if and only if
$\lim_{|\alpha|\to\infty} \sqrt[|\alpha|]{|c_\alpha|\rho^\alpha}=1$
to the multidimensional power series
$\sum_{\alpha\geq0}c_\alpha(z-a)^\alpha := \sum_{\alpha_1\geq0,\ldots,\alpha_n\geq0}c_{\alpha_1,\ldots,\alpha_n}(z_1-a_1)^{\alpha_1}\ldots(z_n-a_n)^{\alpha_n}$
