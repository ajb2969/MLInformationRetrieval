   Arterial resistivity index      Arterial resistivity index   The arterial resistivity index (also called as Resistance index , abbreviated as RI), developed by Leandre Pourcelot , is a measure of pulsatile blood flow that reflects the resistance to blood flow caused by microvascular bed distal to the site of measurement.  Calculation  The formula used to calculate resistance index is: 1       R  I   =     v   s  y  s  t  o  l  e    -   v   d  i  a  s  t  o  l  e      v   s  y  s  t  o  l  e           R  I        subscript  v    s  y  s  t  o  l  e     subscript  v    d  i  a  s  t  o  l  e      subscript  v    s  y  s  t  o  l  e       RI=\frac{v_{systole}-v_{diastole}}{v_{systole}}     Description      Resistance index   Description       0   Continuous flow     1   Systolic flow, but no diastolic flow     >1   Reversed diastolic flow     The RI is altered not by vascular resistance alone but by the combination of vascular resistance and vascular compliance. 2 3  Uses   It is used in ultrasound testing of umbilical artery for placental insufficiency . RI should not exceed 0.60 at 30 weeks of gestation . 4   See also   Pulsatility index  Leandre Pourcelot (French)   References  External links   Resistivity index (English/Spanish)  Pulsatility index (Spanish)   "  Category:Cardiovascular diseases  Category:Medical tests  Category:Medical ultrasonography     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
