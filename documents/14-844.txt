Arterial resistivity index




Arterial resistivity index

The arterial resistivity index (also called as Resistance index, abbreviated as RI), developed by Leandre Pourcelot, is a measure of pulsatile blood flow that reflects the resistance to blood flow caused by microvascular bed distal to the site of measurement.
Calculation
The formula used to calculate resistance index is:1



Description




Resistance index

Description





0

Continuous flow



1

Systolic flow, but no diastolic flow



>1

Reversed diastolic flow



The RI is altered not by vascular resistance alone but by the combination of vascular resistance and vascular compliance.23
Uses

It is used in ultrasound testing of umbilical artery for placental insufficiency. RI should not exceed 0.60 at 30 weeks of gestation.4
