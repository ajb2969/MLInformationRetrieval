   Isoelastic function      Isoelastic function   In mathematical economics , an isoelastic function , sometimes constant elasticity function , is a function that exhibits a constant elasticity , i.e. has a constant elasticity coefficient . The elasticity is the ratio of the percentage change in the dependent variable to the percentage causative change in the independent variable , in the limit as the changes approach zero in magnitude.  For an elasticity coefficient   r   r   r   (which can take on any real value), the function's general form is given by        f   (  x  )    =   k   x  r     ,        f  x     k   superscript  x  r      f(x)={kx^{r}},   where   k   k   k   and   r   r   r   are constants. The elasticity is by definition       elasticity  =      ∂  f    (  x  )     ∂  x     x   f   (  x  )      =     ∂   ln  f     (  x  )     ∂   ln  x      ,        elasticity          f   x     x      x    f  x                  ln  f    x       ln  x        \text{elasticity}=\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x}\frac{x}{f(x)}=\frac{%
 \partial\text{ln}f(x)}{\partial\text{ln}x},     which for this function simply equals r .  Examples  Demand functions  An example in microeconomics is the constant elasticity demand function , in which p is the price of a product and D ( p ) is the resulting quantity demanded by consumers. For most goods the elasticity r (the responsiveness of quantity demanded to price) is negative, so it can be convenient to write the constant elasticity demand function with a negative sign on the exponent, in order for the coefficient   r   r   r   to take on a positive value:        D   (  p  )    =   k   p   -  r      ,        D  p     k   superscript  p    r       D(p)={kp^{-r}},   where    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   is now interpreted as the unsigned magnitude of the responsiveness. 1  Utility functions in the presence of risk  The constant elasticity function is also used in the theory of choice under risk aversion , which usually assumes that risk-averse decision-makers maximize the expected value of a concave  von Neumann-Morgenstern utility function . In this context, with a constant elasticity of utility with respect to, say, wealth, optimal decisions on such things as shares of stocks in a portfolio are independent of the scale of the decision-maker's wealth. The constant elasticity utility function in this context is generally written as       U   (  x  )    =    1   1  -  γ     x   1  -  γ           U  x       1    1  γ     superscript  x    1  γ       U(x)=\frac{1}{1-\gamma}x^{1-\gamma}     where x is wealth and    1  -  γ      1  γ    1-\gamma   is the elasticity, with    γ  >  0      γ  0    \gamma>0   ,   γ   γ   \gamma   ≠ 1 referred to as the constant coefficient of relative risk aversion (with risk aversion approaching infinity as   γ   γ   \gamma   → ∞).
