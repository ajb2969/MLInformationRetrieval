   Neighbourhood space      Neighbourhood space   In topology and related areas of mathematics , a neighbourhood space is a set  X such that for each    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   there is an associated neighbourhood system     ℜ  x     subscript  ℜ  x    \mathfrak{R}_{x}   . 1  A subset O of a neighbourhood space is called open if for every    x  ∈  O      x  O    x\in O   is a neighbourhood of x. Under this definition the open sets of a neighbourhood space give rise to a topological space . Conversely, every topological space is a neighbourhood space under the usual definition of a neighbourhood in a topological space. 2  See also   neighbourhood   References    "  Category:General topology     ↩
