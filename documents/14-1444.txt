Neighbourhood space

In topology and related areas of mathematics, a neighbourhood space is a set X such that for each 
 
 
 
  there is an associated neighbourhood system

 
 .1
A subset O of a neighbourhood space is called open if for every 
 
 
 
  is a neighbourhood of x. Under this definition the open sets of a neighbourhood space give rise to a topological space. Conversely, every topological space is a neighbourhood space under the usual definition of a neighbourhood in a topological space.2
