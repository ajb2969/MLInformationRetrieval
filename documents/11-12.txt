Tartrate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a tartrate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R,R)-tartrate 
 
 
 
  D-glycerate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (R,R)-tartrate, and two products, D-glycerate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R,R)-tartrate carboxy-lyase (D-glycerate-forming). This enzyme is also called (R,R)-tartrate carboxy-lyase.
