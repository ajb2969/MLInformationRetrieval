L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a L-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-arabinose + NAD+

 
  L-arabinono-1,4-lactone + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-arabinose and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are L-arabinono-1,4-lactone, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arabinose:NAD+ 1-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
