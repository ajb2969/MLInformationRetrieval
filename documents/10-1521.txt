NADH dehydrogenase (quinone)




NADH dehydrogenase (quinone)

In enzymology, a NADH dehydrogenase (quinone) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

NADH + H+ + acceptor 
 
 
 
  NAD+ + reduced acceptor
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADH, H+, and acceptor, whereas its two products are NAD+ and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADH:(quinone-acceptor) oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (quinone) dehydrogenase, NADH-quinone oxidoreductase, NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase, DPNH-menadione reductase, D-diaphorase, and NADH2 dehydrogenase (quinone), and mitochondrial (mt) complex I. This enzyme participates in oxidative phosphorylation. Several compounds are known to inhibit this enzyme, including AMP, and 2,4-Dinitrophenol.
Structural studies
Several structures are available of this enzyme, which is part of the respiratory chain. It is a multi-subunit enzyme in which this activity is located in the hydrophilic domain. The subunits of the membrane-embedded domain are responsible for proton translocation.
