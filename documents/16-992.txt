Monotone comparative statics
'''Monotone comparative statics''' is a sub
 -field of comparative statics that focuses on the conditions under which endogenous variables undergo monotone changes (that is, either increasing or decreasing) when there is a change in the exogenous parameters. Traditionally, comparative results in economics are obtained using the Implicit Function Theorem, an approach that requires the concavity and differentiability of the objective function as well as the interiority and uniqueness of the optimal solution. The methods of monotone comparative statics typically dispense with these assumptions. It focuses on the main property underpinning monotone comparative statics, which is a form of complementarity between the endogenous variable and exogenous parameter. Roughly speaking, a maximization problem displays complementarity if a higher value of the exogenous parameter increases the marginal return of the endogenous variable. This guarantees that the set of solutions to the optimization problem is increasing with respect to the exogenous parameter.
Basic results
Motivation
Let 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a family of functions parameterized by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a partially ordered set (or poset, for short). How does the correspondence

 
  vary with 
 
 
 
 ?
Standard comparative statics approach: Assume that set 
 
 
 
  is a compact interval and 
 
 
 
  is a continuously differentiable, strictly quasiconcave function of 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the unique maximizer of 
 
 
 
 , it suffices to show that 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 , which guarantees that 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
 . This guarantees that the optimum has shifted to the right, i.e., 
 
 
 
 . This approach makes various assumptions, most notably the quasiconcavity of 
 
 
 
 .
One-dimensional optimization problems
While it is clear what it means for a unique optimal solution to be increasing, it is not immediately clear what it means for the correspondence 
 
 
 
  to be increasing in 
 
 
 
 . The standard definition adopted by the literature is the following.
Definition (strong set order):1 Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be subsets of 
 
 
 
 . Set 
 
 
 
  dominates 
 
 
 
  in the strong set order (
 
 
 
 ) if for any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
In particular, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 . The correspondence 
 
 
 
  is said to be increasing if 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
 .
The notion of complementarity between exogenous and endogenous variables is formally captured by single crossing differences.
Definition (single crossing function): Let 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a single crossing function if for any 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 .
Definition (single crossing differences):2 The family of functions 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , obey single crossing differences (or satisfy the single crossing property) if for all 
 
 
 
 , function 
 
 
 
  is a single crossing function.
Obviously, an increasing function is a single crossing function and, if 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
  (in the above definition, for any 
 
 
 
 ), we say that 
 
 
 
  obey increasing differences. Unlike increasing differences, single crossing differences is an ordinal property, i.e., if 
 
 
 
  obey single crossing differences, then so do 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  for some function 
 
 
 
  that is strictly increasing in 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem 1:3 Define 
 
 
 
 . The family 
 
 
 
  obey single crossing differences if and only if for all 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 .

Proof: Assume 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . We have to show that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We only need to consider the case where 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
 , we obtain 
 
 
 
 , which guarantees that 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
 . If not, 
 
 
 
  which implies (by single crossing differences) that 
 
 
 
 , contradicting the optimality of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . To show the necessity of single crossing differences, set 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
  guarantees that, if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . Q.E.D.


Application (monopoly output and changes in costs): A monopolist chooses 
 
 
 
  to maximise its profit 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the inverse demand function and 
 
 
 
  is the constant marginal cost. Note that 
 
 
 
  obey single crossing differences. Indeed, take any 
 
 
 
  and assume that 
 
 
 
 ; for any 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , we obtain 
 
 
 
 . By Theorem 1, the profit-maximizing output decreases as the marginal cost of output increases, i.e., as 
 
 
 
  decreases.
Interval dominance order
Single crossing differences is not a necessary condition for the optimal solution to be increasing with respect to a parameter. In fact, the condition is necessary only for 
 
 
 
  to be increasing in 
 
 
 
  for any

 
 . Once the sets are restricted to a narrower class of subsets of 
 
 
 
 , the single crossing differences condition is no longer necessary.
Definition (Interval):4 Let 
 
 
 
 . A set 
 
 
 
  is an interval of 
 
 
 
  if, whenever 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are in 
 
 
 
 , then any 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is also in 
 
 
 
 .
For example, if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is an interval of 
 
 
 
  but not 
 
 
 
 . Denote 
 
 
 
 .
Definition (Interval Dominance Order):5 The family 
 
 
 
  obey the interval dominance order (IDO) if for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 .
Like single crossing differences, the interval dominance order (IDO) is an ordinal property. An example of an IDO family is a family of quasiconcave functions 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  increasing in 
 
 
 
 . Such a family need not obey single crossing differences.
A function 
 
 
 
  is regular if 
 
 
 
  is non-empty for any 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the interval 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem 2:6 Denote 
 
 
 
 . A family of regular functions 
 
 
 
  obeys the interval dominance order if and only if 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
  for all intervals 
 
 
 
 .

Proof: To show the sufficiency of IDO, take any two 
 
 
 
 , and assume that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We only need to consider the case where 
 
 
 
 . By definition 
 
 
 
 , for all 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, by IDO we have 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, it must be that 
 
 
 
 . Otherwise, i.e., if 
 
 
 
 , then by IDO we have 
 
 
 
 , which contradicts that 
 
 
 
 . To show the necessity of IDO, assume that there is an interval 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . This means that 
 
 
 
 . There are two possible violations of IDO. One possibility is that 
 
 
 
 . In this case, by the regularity of 
 
 
 
 , the set 
 
 
 
  is non-empty but does not contain 
 
 
 
  which is impossible since 
 
 
 
  increases in 
 
 
 
 . Another possible violation of IDO occurs if 
 
 
 
  but 
 
 
 
 . In this case, the set 
 
 
 
  either contains 
 
 
 
 , which is not possible since 
 
 
 
  increases in 
 
 
 
  (note that in this case 
 
 
 
 ) or it does not contain 
 
 
 
 , which also violates monotonicity of 
 
 
 
 . Q.E.D.


The next result gives useful sufficient conditions for single crossing differences and IDO.
Proposition 1:7 Let 
 
 
 
  be an interval of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a family of continuously differentiable functions. (i) If, for any 
 
 
 
 , there exists a number 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  obey single crossing differences. (ii) If, for any 
 
 
 
 , there exists a nondecreasing, strictly positive function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  obey IDO.
Application (Optimal stopping problem):8 At each moment in time, agent gains profit of 
 
 
 
 , which can be positive or negative. If agent decides to stop at time 
 
 
 
 , the present value of his accumulated profit is



where 
 
 
 
  is the discount rate. Since 
 
 
 
 , the function 
 
 
 
  has many turning points and they do not vary with the discount rate. We claim that the optimal stopping time is decreasing in 
 
 
 
 , i.e., if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 . Take any 
 
 
 
 . Then, 
 
 
 
  Since 
 
 
 
  is positive and increasing, Proposition 1 says that 
 
 
 
  obey IDO and, by Theorem 2, the set of optimal stopping times is decreasing.
Multi-dimensional optimization problems
The above results can be extended to a multi-dimensional setting. Let 
 
 
 
  be a lattice. For any two 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , we denote their supremum (or least upper bound, or join) by 
 
 
 
  and their infimum (or greatest lower bound, or meet) by 
 
 
 
 .
Definition (Strong Set Order):9 Let 
 
 
 
  be a lattice and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be subsets of 
 
 
 
 . We say that 
 
 
 
  dominates 
 
 
 
  in the strong set order (
 
 
 
  ) if for any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
Examples of the strong set order in higher dimensions.

Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be some closed intervals in 
 
 
 
 . Clearly 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the standard ordering on 
 
 
 
 , is a lattice. Therefore, as it was shown in the previous section 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ;


Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be some hyperrectangles. That is, there exist some vectors 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the natural, coordinate-wise ordering on 
 
 
 
 . Note that 
 
 
 
  is a lattice. Moreover, 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ;


Let 
 
 
 
  be a space of all probability distributions with support being a subset of 
 
 
 
 , endowed with the first order stochastic dominance order 
 
 
 
 . Note that 
 
 
 
  is a lattice. Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  denote sets of probability distributions with support 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. Then, 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

Definition (Quasisupermodular function):10 Let 
 
 
 
  be a lattice. The function 
 
 
 
  is quasisupermodular (QSM) if



The function 
 
 
 
  is said to be a supermodular function if 
 
 
 
  Every supermodular function is quasisupermodular. As in the case of single crossing differences, and unlike supermodularity, quasisupermodularity is an ordinal property. That is, if function 
 
 
 
  is quasisupermodular, then so is function 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is some strictly increasing function.
Theorem 3:11 Let 
 
 
 
  is a lattice, 
 
 
 
  a partially ordered set, and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  subsets of 
 
 
 
 . Given 
 
 
 
 , we denote 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 


Proof:

 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . By quasisupermodularity, 
 
 
 
 , and by the single crossing differences, 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Now assume that 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 . By quasisupermodularity, 
 
 
 
 , and by single crossing differences 
 
 
 
 . But this contradicts that 
 
 
 
 . Hence, 
 
 
 
 .
 



 
 . Set 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then, 
 
 
 
  and thus 
 
 
 
 , which guarantees that, if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . To show that single crossing differences also hold, set 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
  guarantees that, if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . Q.E.D.
Application (Production with multiple goods):12 Let 
 
 
 
  denote the vector of inputs (drawn from a sublattice 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 ) of a profit-maximizing firm, 
 
 
 
  be the vector of input prices, and 
 
 
 
  the revenue function mapping input vector 
 
 
 
  to revenue (in 
 
 
 
 ). The firm's profit is 
 
 
 
 . For any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
 . Hence, 
 
 
 
  has increasing differences (and so it obeys single crossing differences). Moreover, if 
 
 
 
  is supermodular, then so is 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, it is quasisupermodular and by Theorem 3, 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Constrained optimization problems
In some important economic applications, the relevant change in the constraint set cannot be easily understood as an increase with respect to the strong set order and so Theorem 3 cannot be easily applied. For example, consider a consumer who maximizes a utility function 
 
 
 
  subject to a budget constraint. At price 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and wealth 
 
 
 
 , his budget set is 
 
 
 
  and his demand set at 
 
 
 
  is (by definition) 
 
 
 
 . A basic property of consumer demand is normality, which means (in the case where demand is unique) that the demand of each good is increasing in wealth. Theorem 3 cannot be straightforwardly applied to obtain conditions for normality, because 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  (when 
 
 
 
  is derived from the Euclidean order). In this case, the following result holds.
Theorem 4:13 Suppose 
 
 
 
  is supermodular and concave. Then the demand correspondence is normal in the following sense: suppose 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; then there is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The supermodularity of 
 
 
 
  alone guarantees that, for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . Note that the four points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  form a rectangle in Euclidean space (in the sense that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are orthogonal). On the other hand, supermodularity and concavity together guarantee that 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . In this case, crucially, the four points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  form a backward-leaning parallelogram in Euclidean space.
Monotone comparative statics under uncertainty
Let 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be a family of real-valued functions defined on 
 
 
 
  that obey single crossing differences or the interval dominance order. Theorem 1 and 3 tell us that 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
 . Interpreting 
 
 
 
  to be the state of the world, this says that the optimal action is increasing in the state if the state is known. Suppose, however, that the action 
 
 
 
  is taken before 
 
 
 
  is realized; then it seems reasonable that the optimal action should increase with the likelihood of higher states. To capture this notion formally, let 
 
 
 
  be a family of density functions parameterized by 
 
 
 
  in the poset 
 
 
 
 , where higher 
 
 
 
  is associated with a higher likelihood of higher states, either in the sense of first order stochastic dominance or the monotone likelihood ratio property. Choosing under uncertainty, the agent maximizes



For 
 
 
 
  to be increasing in 
 
 
 
 , it suffices (by Theorems 1 and 2) that family 
 
 
 
  obey single crossing differences or the interval dominance order. The results in this section give condition under which this holds.
Theorem 5: Suppose 
 
 

 
  obeys increasing differences. If 
 
 
 
  is ordered with respect to first order stochastic dominance, then 
 
 
 
  obeys increasing differences.

Proof: For any 
 
 
 
 , define 
 
 
 
 . Then, 
 
 
 
 , or equivalntly 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  obeys increasing differences, 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
  and first order stochastic dominance guarantees 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
 . Q.E.D.


In the following theorem, X can be either ``single crossing differences" or ``the interval dominance order".
Theorem 6:14 Suppose 
 
 
 
  (for 
 
 
 
 ) obeys X. Then the family 
 
 
 
  obeys X if 
 
 
 
  is ordered with respect to the monotone likelihood ratio property.
The monotone likelihood ratio condition in this theorem cannot be weakened, as the next result demonstrates.
Proposition 2: Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two probability mass functions defined on 
 
 
 
  and suppose 
 
 
 
  is does not dominate 
 
 
 
  with respect to the monotone likelihood ratio property. Then there is a family of functions 
 
 
 
 , defined on 
 
 
 
 , that obey single crossing differences, such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  (for 
 
 
 
 ).
Application (Optimal portfolio problem): An agent maximizes expected utility with the strictly increasing Bernoulli utility function 
 
 
 
 . (Concavity is not assumed, so we allow the agent to be risk loving.) The wealth of the agent, 
 
 
 
 , can be invested in a safe or risky asset. The prices of the two assets are normalized at 1. The safe asset gives a constant return 
 
 
 
 , while the return of the risky asset 
 
 
 
  is governed by the probability distribution 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  denote the agent's investment in the risky asset. Then the wealth of the agent in state 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . The agent chooses 
 
 
 
  to maximize



Note that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , obeys single crossing (though not necessarily increasing) differences. By Theorem 6, 
 
 
 
  obeys single crossing differences, and hence 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  is ordered with respect to the monotone likelihood ratio property.
Aggregation of the single crossing property
While the sum of increasing functions is also increasing, it is clear that the single crossing property need not be preserved by aggregation. For the sum of single crossing functions to have the same property requires that the functions be related to each other in a particular manner.
Definition (monotone signed-ratio):15 Let 
 
 
 
  be a poset. Two functions 
 
 
 
  obey signed{ -}ratio monotonicity if, for any 
 
 
 
 , the following holds:

if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then










if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then









Proposition 3: Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two single crossing functions. Then 
 
 
 
  is a single crossing function for any non{-}negative scalars 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  obey signed-ratio monotonicity.

Proof: Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Define 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is a single crossing function, it must be that 
 
 
 
 , for any 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, recall that since 
 
 
 
  is a single crossing function, then 
 
 
 
 . By rearranging the above inequality, we conclude that
 










To prove the converse, without loss of generality assume that 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that
 
 :


\alpha f(s) + g(s) \geq (>) 0. 

If both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  since both functions are single crossing. Hence, 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  obey signed{-}ratio monotonicity it must be that
 










Since 
 
 
 
  is a single crossing function, 
 
 
 
 , and so 
 
 
Q.E.D.


This result can be generalized to infinite sums in the following sense.
Theorem 7:16 Let 
 
 
 
  be a finite measure space and suppose that, for each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a bounded and measurable function of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a single crossing function if, for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , the pair of functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  satisfy signed-ratio monotonicity. This condition is also necessary if 
 
 
 
  contains all singleton sets and 
 
 
 
  is required to be an single crossing function for any finite measure 
 
 
 
 .
Application (Monopoly problem under uncertainty):17 A firm faces uncertainty over the demand for its output 
 
 
 
  and the profit at state 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the marginal cost and 
 
 
 
  is the inverse demand function in state 
 
 
 
 . The firm maximizes



where 
 
 
 
  is the probability of state 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the Bernoulli utility function representing the firm’s attitude towards uncertainty. By Theorem 1, 
 
 
 
  is increasing in 
 
 
 
  (i.e., output falls with marginal cost) if the family 
 
 
 
  obeys single crossing differences. By definition, the latter says that, for any 
 
 
 
 , the function



is a single crossing function. For each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is s single crossing function of 
 
 
 
 . However, unless 
 
 
 
  is linear, 
 
 
 
  will not, in general, be increasing in 
 
 
 
 . Applying Theorem 6, 
 
 
 
  is a single crossing function if, for any 
 
 
 
 , the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (of 
 
 
 
 ) obey signed-ratio monotonicity. This is guaranteed when (i) 
 
 
 
  is decreasing in 
 
 
 
  and increasing in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  obeys increasing differences; and (ii) 
 
 
 
  is twice differentiable, with 
 
 
 
 , and obeys decreasing absolute risk aversion (DARA).
