   Productive matrix      Productive matrix   In linear algebra , a square  nonnegative matrix  $A$ of order $n$ is said to be productive , or to be a Leontief matrix , if there exists a $n \times 1$ nonnegative column matrix  $P$ such as $P-AP$ is a positive matrix .  History  The concept of productive matrix was developed by the economist Wassily Leontief ( Nobel Prize in Economics in 1973) in order to model and analyze the relations between the different sectors of an economy. 1 The interdependency linkages between the latter can be examined by the input-output model with empirical data.  Explicit definition  The matrix $A\in\mathrm{M}_n(\R)$ is productive if and only if $A \geqslant 0$ and $\exists P \in\mathrm{M}_{n,1}(\R), P>0$ such as $P-AP>0$ .  Examples  The matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1/2 & 1/2 \\ 1/4 & 1/2 & 0 \\ \end{pmatrix}$ is productive.  $\forall a\in\R_+$ , the matrix $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0 & a \\ 0 & 0 \\ \end{pmatrix}$ is productive since $P = \begin{pmatrix} a+1 \\ 1 \\ \end{pmatrix}$ verifies the inequalities of definition.  Properties 2  Characterization  Theorem A nonnegative matrix $A\in\mathrm{M}_n(\R)$ is productive if and only if $I_n - A$ is invertible with a nonnegative inverse.  Demonstration  Direct involvement :   Let $U \in\mathrm{M}_{n,1}(\R), P>0$ .  Thus the matrix $P = (I_n - A)^{-1}U$ is nonnegative as being the product of two nonnegative matrices.  Moreover, $P - AP = (I_n - A) P = (I_n - A) (I_n - A)^{-1} U = U$ .  Hence $P - AP > 0$ .  Therefore $A$ is productive.   Reciprocal involvement :   We shall proceed by reductio ad absurdum .  Let us assume $\exists P > 0$ such as $V = P - AP > 0$ & $I_n - A$ is singular .  The endomorphism canonically associated with $I_n - A$ can not be injective by singularity of the matrix.  Thus $\exists Z\in\mathrm{M}_{n,1}(\R)$ non zero such as $(I_n - A) Z = 0$ .  The matrix $-Z$ verifies the same properties as $Z$ , therefore we can choose $Z$ as an element of the kernel with at least one positive entry;  Hence $c = \sup_{i \in [|1,n|]}\frac{z_i}{p_i}$ is nonnegative and reached with at least one value $k \in [|1,n|]$ .  By definition of $V$ and of $Z$ , we can infer that: $$cv_k = c (p_k - \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}p_i) = cp_k -  \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}cp_i$$  $$cp_k = z_k =  \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}z_i$$   Thus $cv_k =  \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki} (z_j - cp_j) \leq\ 0$ .  Yet we know that $c > 0$ and that $v_k > 0$ .  Therefore there is a contradiction, ipso facto  $I_n - A$ is necessarily invertible.  Now let us assume $I_n - A$ is invertible but with at least one negative entry in its inverse.  Hence $\exists X \in\mathrm{M}_{n,1}(\R), X  \geqslant 0$ such as there is at least one negative entry in $Y = (I_n - A)^{-1} X$ .  Then $c = \sup_{i \in [|1,n|]}-\frac{y_i}{p_i}$ is positive and reached with at least one value $k \in [|1,n|]$ .  By definition of $V$ and of $X$ , we can infer that: $$cv_k = c (p_k - \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}p_i) = -y_k  -\sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}cp_i$$  $$x_k = y_k - \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki}y_i$$  $$cv_k + x_k = - \sum_{i=1}^n a_{ki} (cp_i + y_i)$$   Thus $x_k \leq\ - cv_k < 0$ since $\forall i \in [|1,n|], a_ki\geqslant 0, cp_i + y_i \geqslant 0$ .  Yet we know that $X \geqslant 0$ .  Therefore ther is a contradiction, ipso facto  $(I_n - A)^{-1}$ is necessarily nonnegative.   Transposition  Proposition The transpose of a productive matrix is productive.  Demonstration   Let $A\in\mathrm{M}_n(\R)$ a productive matrix.  Then $(I_n - A)^{-1}$ exists and is nonnegative.  Yet $((I_n - ^{\operatorname t}\!A))^{-1} = (^{\operatorname t}\!(I_n - A))^{-1} = ^{\operatorname t}\!((I_n - A)^{-1})$   Hence $(I_n - ^{\operatorname t}\!A)$ is invertible with a nonnegative inverse.  Therefore $^{\operatorname t}\!A$ is productive.   Application  With a matrix approach of the input-output model , the consumption matrix is productive if it is economically viable and if the latter and the demand vector are nonnegative.
