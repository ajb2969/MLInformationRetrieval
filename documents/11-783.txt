   Pyrithiamine deaminase      Pyrithiamine deaminase   In enzymology , a pyrithiamine deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-(4-amino-2-methylpyrimid-5-ylmethyl)-3-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-2- methylpyridinium bromide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-(4-hydroxy-2-methylpyrimid-5-ylmethyl)-3-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-2- methylpyridinium bromide + NH 3    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 1-(4-amino-2-methylpyrimid-5-ylmethyl)-3-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-2- , methylpyridinium bromide , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 1-(4-hydroxy-2-methylpyrimid-5-ylmethyl)-3-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-2- , methylpyridinium bromide , and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(4-amino-2-methylpyrimid-5-ylmethyl)-3-(beta-hydroxyethyl)-2-methy lpyridinium-bromide aminohydrolase .
