   Gaussian isoperimetric inequality      Gaussian isoperimetric inequality   In mathematics, the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality , proved by Boris Tsirelson and Vladimir Sudakov and independently by Christer Borell , states that among all sets of given Gaussian measure in the n -dimensional Euclidean space , half-spaces have the minimal Gaussian boundary measure .  Mathematical formulation  Let   A   A   \scriptstyle A   be a measurable subset of    ùêë  n     superscript  ùêë  n    \scriptstyle\mathbf{R}^{n}   endowed with the Gaussian measure Œ≥  n . Denote by       A  Œµ   =   {   x  ‚àà    ùêë  n     |    dist   (  x  ,  A  )    ‚â§  Œµ   }        subscript  A  Œµ    conditional-set    x   superscript  ùêë  n        dist   x  A    Œµ      A_{\varepsilon}=\left\{x\in\mathbf{R}^{n}\,|\,\text{dist}(x,A)\leq\varepsilon\right\}     the Œµ-extension of A . Then the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality states that         lim inf   Œµ  ‚Üí   +  0       Œµ   -  1     {     Œ≥  n    (   A  Œµ   )    -    Œ≥  n    (  A  )     }     ‚â•   œÜ   (    Œ¶   -  1     (    Œ≥  n    (  A  )    )    )     ,        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-‚Üí  Œµ    0        superscript  Œµ    1          superscript  Œ≥  n    subscript  A  Œµ       superscript  Œ≥  n   A         œÜ     superscript  normal-Œ¶    1       superscript  Œ≥  n   A       \liminf_{\varepsilon\to+0}\varepsilon^{-1}\left\{\gamma^{n}(A_{\varepsilon})-%
 \gamma^{n}(A)\right\}\geq\varphi(\Phi^{-1}(\gamma^{n}(A))),     where         œÜ   (  t  )    =     exp   (   -    t  2   /  2    )      2  œÄ     and      Œ¶   (  t  )    =    ‚à´   -  ‚àû   t    œÜ   (  s  )   d  s      .     formulae-sequence      œÜ  t             superscript  t  2   2         2  œÄ     and        normal-Œ¶  t     superscript   subscript        t     œÜ  s  d  s       \varphi(t)=\frac{\exp(-t^{2}/2)}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\quad{\rm and}\quad\Phi(t)=\int_{%
 -\infty}^{t}\varphi(s)\,ds.     Remarks on the proofs  The original proofs by Sudakov, Tsirelson and Borell were based on Paul L√©vy 's spherical isoperimetric inequality . Another approach is due to Bobkov, who introduced a functional inequality generalizing the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality and derived it from a certain two-point inequality. Bakry and Ledoux gave another proof of Bobkov's functional inequality based on the semigroup techniques which works in a much more abstract setting. Later Barthe and Maurey gave yet another proof using the Brownian motion .  The Gaussian isoperimetric inequality also follows from Ehrhard's inequality (cf. Lata≈Ça, Borell).
