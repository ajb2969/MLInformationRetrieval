Gaussian isoperimetric inequality

In mathematics, the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality, proved by Boris Tsirelson and Vladimir Sudakov and independently by Christer Borell, states that among all sets of given Gaussian measure in the n-dimensional Euclidean space, half-spaces have the minimal Gaussian boundary measure.
Mathematical formulation
Let 
 
 
 
  be a measurable subset of 
 
 
 
  endowed with the Gaussian measure γ n. Denote by



the ε-extension of A. Then the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality states that

Remarks on the proofs
The original proofs by Sudakov, Tsirelson and Borell were based on Paul Lévy's spherical isoperimetric inequality. Another approach is due to Bobkov, who introduced a functional inequality generalizing the Gaussian isoperimetric inequality and derived it from a certain two-point inequality. Bakry and Ledoux gave another proof of Bobkov's functional inequality based on the semigroup techniques which works in a much more abstract setting. Later Barthe and Maurey gave yet another proof using the Brownian motion.
The Gaussian isoperimetric inequality also follows from Ehrhard's inequality (cf. Latała, Borell).
