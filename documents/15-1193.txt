Lupanine 17-hydroxylase (cytochrome c)

Lupanine 17-hydroxylase (cytochrome c) (, lupanine dehydrogenase (cytochrome c)) is an enzyme with system name lupanine:cytochrome c-oxidoreductase (17-hydroxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

lupanine + 2 ferricytochrome c + H2O 
 
 
 
  17-hydroxylupanine + 2 ferrocytochrome c + 2 H+


The enzyme isolated from Pseudomonas putida contains heme c and requires pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) for activity
