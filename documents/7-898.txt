Schreier vector

In mathematics, especially the field of computational group theory, a Schreier vector is a tool for reducing the time and space complexity required to calculate orbits of a permutation group.
Overview
Suppose G is a finite group with generating sequence 
 
 
 
  which acts on the finite set 
 
 
 
 . A common task in computational group theory is to compute the orbit of some element 
 
 
 
  under G. At the same time, one can record a Schreier vector for 
 
 
 
 . This vector can then be used to find an element 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
 , for any 
 
 
 
 . Use of Schreier vectors to perform this requires less storage space and time complexity than storing these g explicitly.
Formal definition
All variables used here are defined in the overview.
A Schreier vector for

Use in algorithms
Here we illustrate, using pseudocode, the use of Schreier vectors in two algorithms

Algorithm to compute the orbit of ω under G and the corresponding Schreier vector


Input: ω in Ω, 
 
 



for i in { 0, 1, …, n }:
 
set v[i] = 0
 




set orbit = { ω }, v[ω] = −1
 


for α in orbit and i in { 1, 2, …, r }:
 
if 
 
 
 
  is not in orbit:
 
append 
 
 
 
  to orbit

set 
 
 







return orbit, v



Algorithm to find a g in G such that ωg = α for some α in Ω, using the v from the first algorithm


Input: v, α, X



if v[α] = 0:
 
return false
 




set g = e, and k = v[α] (where e is the identity element of G)
 


while k ≠ −1:
 
set 
 
 





return g
