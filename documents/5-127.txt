   Adjunction space      Adjunction space   In mathematics , an adjunction space (or attaching space ) is a common construction in topology where one topological space is attached or "glued" onto another. Specifically, let X and Y be topological spaces with A a subspace of Y . Let f : A → X be a continuous map (called the attaching map ). One forms the adjunction space X ∪ f  Y by taking the disjoint union of X and Y and identifying  x with f ( x ) for all x in A . Schematically,      X   ∪  f   Y  =   (  X  ∐  Y  )   /   {  f   (  A  )   ∼  A  }   .     fragments  X   subscript   f   Y    fragments  normal-(  X  coproduct  Y  normal-)     fragments  normal-{  f   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)   similar-to  A  normal-}   normal-.    X\cup_{f}Y=(X\amalg Y)/\{f(A)\sim A\}.     Sometimes, the adjunction is written as    X    +  f    Y      subscript   f   X  Y    X+\!_{f}\,Y   . Intuitively, we think of Y as being glued onto X via the map f .  As a set, X ∪ f  Y consists of the disjoint union of X and ( Y − A ). The topology, however, is specified by the quotient construction. In the case where A is a closed subspace of Y one can show that the map X → X ∪ f  Y is a closed embedding and ( Y − A ) → X ∪ f  Y is an open embedding.  Examples   A common example of an adjunction space is given when Y is a closed n - ball (or cell ) and A is the boundary of the ball, the ( n −1)- sphere . Inductively attaching cells along their spherical boundaries to this space results in an example of a CW complex .  Adjunction spaces are also used to define connected sums of manifolds . Here, one first removes open balls from X and Y before attaching the boundaries of the removed balls along an attaching map.  If A is a space with one point then the adjunction is the wedge sum of X and Y .  If X is a space with one point then the adjunction is the quotient Y / A .   Categorical description  The attaching construction is an example of a pushout in the category of topological spaces . That is to say, the adjunction space is universal with respect to following commutative diagram :   (Figure)  AdjunctionSpace-01.svg    Here i is the inclusion map and φ X , φ Y are the maps obtained by composing the quotient map with the canonical injections into the disjoint union of X and Y . One can form a more general pushout by replacing i with an arbitrary continuous map g — the construction is similar. Conversely, if f is also an inclusion the attaching construction is to simply glue X and Y together along their common subspace.
