   Square root of a 2 by 2 matrix      Square root of a 2 by 2 matrix   A square root of a 2 by 2 matrix  M is another 2 by 2 matrix R such that M = R 2 , where R 2 stands for the matrix product of R with itself. In general there can be no, two, four or even an infinitude of square root matrices. In many cases such a matrix R can be obtained by an explicit formula.  A 2 × 2 matrix with two distinct nonzero eigenvalues has four square roots. A positive-definite matrix has precisely one positive-definite square root.  Square roots of a matrix of any dimension come in pairs: If R is a square root of M , then – R is also a square root of M , since (– R )(– R ) = (–1)(–1)( RR ) = R 2 = M .  One formula  Let 1      M  =   (     A    B      C    D     )       M    A  B    C  D      M=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}A&B\\
 C&D\end{array}\right)   where A , B , C , and D may be real or complex numbers. Furthermore, let τ = A + D be the trace of M , and δ = AD - BC be its determinant . Let s be such that s 2 = δ , and t be such that t 2 = τ + 2 s . That is,        s  =   ±   δ     ,   t  =   ±    τ  +   2  s        .     formulae-sequence    s   plus-or-minus    δ       t   plus-or-minus      τ    2  s         s=\pm\sqrt{\delta},\quad\quad t=\pm\sqrt{\tau+2s}.   Then, if t ≠ 0, a square root of M is       R  =    1  t    (      A  +  s     B      C     D  +  s      )     .      R      1  t       A  s   B    C    D  s        R=\frac{1}{t}\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}A+s&B\\
 C&D+s\end{array}\right).   Indeed, the square of R is         R  2     =      1   t  2     (        (   A  +  s   )   2   +   B  C         (   A  +  s   )   B   +   B   (   D  +  s   )           C   (   A  +  s   )    +    (   D  +  s   )   C         (   D  +  s   )   2   +   B  C       )         =        1   A  +  D  +   2  s      (      A   (   A  +  D  +   2  s    )        (   A  +  D  +   2  s    )   B        C   (   A  +  D  +   2  s    )       D   (   A  +  D  +   2  s    )       )    =  M   .          superscript  R  2        1   superscript  t  2         superscript    A  s   2     B  C          A  s   B     B    D  s           C    A  s        D  s   C       superscript    D  s   2     B  C          missing-subexpression          1    A  D    2  s         A    A  D    2  s         A  D    2  s    B       C    A  D    2  s       D    A  D    2  s        M      \begin{array}[]{rcl}R^{2}&=&\displaystyle\frac{1}{t^{2}}\left(\begin{array}[]{%
 cc}(A+s)^{2}+BC&(A+s)B+B(D+s)\\
 C(A+s)+(D+s)C&(D+s)^{2}+BC\end{array}\right)\\
 &=&\displaystyle\frac{1}{A+D+2s}\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}A(A+D+2s)&(A+D+2s)B\\
 C(A+D+2s)&D(A+D+2s)\end{array}\right)\;=\;M.\end{array}   Note that R may have complex entries even if M is a real matrix; this will be the case, in particular, if the determinant δ is negative. Also, note that R is positive when s>0 and t>0 .  Special cases of the formula  If M is an idempotent matrix , meaning that MM = M , then if it is not the identity matrix its determinant is zero, and its trace equals its rank which (excluding the zero matrix) is 1. Then the above formula has s = 0 and   τ   τ   \tau   = 1, giving M and - M as two square roots of M .  In general, the formula above will provide four distinct square roots R , one for each choice of signs for s and t . If the determinant δ is zero but the trace τ is nonzero, the formula will give only two distinct solutions. It also gives only two distinct solutions if δ is nonzero and τ 2 = 4 δ (the case of duplicate eigenvalues ), in which case one of the choices for s will make the denominator t be zero.  The formula above fails completely if δ and τ are both zero; that is, if D = − A and A 2 = − BC , so that both the trace and the determinant of the matrix are zero. In this case, if M is the null matrix (with A = B = C = D = 0), then the null matrix is also a square root of M , as are       R  =    (     0    0      c    0     )   and     R  =   (     0    b      0    0     )       formulae-sequence    R     0  0    c  0    and      R    0  b    0  0       R=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}0&0\\
 c&0\end{array}\right)\quad\text{and}\quad R=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}0&b\\
 0&0\end{array}\right)     for any real or complex values of b and c . Otherwise M has no square root.  Simpler formulas for special matrices  Diagonal matrix  If M is diagonal (that is, B = C = 0), one can use the simplified formula      R  =   (     a    0      0    d     )       R    a  0    0  d      R=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}a&0\\
 0&d\end{array}\right)   where a = ±√ A and d = ±√ D ; which, depending on the sign choices, gives four, two, or one distinct matrices, if none of, only one of, or both A and D are zero, respectively.  Identity matrix  Because it has duplicate eigenvalues , the 2×2 identity matrix     (          1    0      0    1     )      absent    1  0    0  1     \bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}\\
 1&0\\
 0&1\end{smallmatrix}\bigr)   has infinitely many symmetric rational square roots given by         1  t     (          s     r  ;       r     -  s      )    ,        1  t     absent    s  r    r    s       \tfrac{1}{t}\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}\\
 s&r\\
 r&-s\end{smallmatrix}\bigr),         1  t    (          s     -  r        -  r      -  s      )    ,        1  t     absent    s    r       r     s       \tfrac{1}{t}\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}\\
 s&-r\\
 -r&-s\end{smallmatrix}\bigr),         1  t    (           -  s      r  ;       r     s  ;      )    ,        1  t     absent      s   r    r  s      \tfrac{1}{t}\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}\\
 -s&r\\
 r&s\end{smallmatrix}\bigr),         1  t    (           -  s      -  r        -  r      s  ;      )    ,        1  t     absent      s     r       r   s      \tfrac{1}{t}\bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}\\
 -s&-r\\
 -r&s\end{smallmatrix}\bigr),        (          1    0      0     ±  1      )   ,      absent    1  0    0   plus-or-minus  1      \bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}\\
 1&0\\
 0&\pm 1\end{smallmatrix}\bigr),   and     (           -  1     0      0     ±  1      )   ,      absent      1   0    0   plus-or-minus  1      \bigl(\begin{smallmatrix}\\
 -1&0\\
 0&\pm 1\end{smallmatrix}\bigr),   where    (  r  ,  s  ,  t  )     r  s  t    (r,s,t)   is any Pythagorean triple —that is, any set of positive integers such that       r  2   +   s  2    =   t  2    .         superscript  r  2    superscript  s  2     superscript  t  2     r^{2}+s^{2}=t^{2}.    2 In addition, any non-integer, irrational, or complex values of r, s, t satisfying      r  2   +   s  2    =   t  2          superscript  r  2    superscript  s  2     superscript  t  2     r^{2}+s^{2}=t^{2}   give square root matrices. The identity matrix also has infinitely many non-symmetric square roots.  Matrix with one off-diagonal zero  If B is zero but A and D are not both zero, one can use       R  =   (     a    0       C  /   (   a  +  d   )      d     )    .      R    a  0      C    a  d    d      R=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}a&0\\
 C/(a+d)&d\end{array}\right).   This formula will provide two solutions if A = D , and four otherwise. A similar formula can be used when C is zero but A and D are not both zero.
