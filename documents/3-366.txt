   Colombeau algebra      Colombeau algebra   In mathematics , a Colombeau algebra is an algebra of a certain kind containing the space of Schwartz distributions . While in classical distribution theory a general multiplication of distributions is not possible, Colombeau algebras provide a rigorous framework for this.  Such a multiplication of distributions has long been believed to be impossible because of L. Schwartz' impossibility result, which basically states that there cannot be a differential algebra containing the space of distributions and preserving the product of continuous functions. However, if one only wants to preserve the product of smooth functions instead such a construction becomes possible as demonstrated first by Colombeau.  As a mathematical tool, Colombeau algebras can be said to combine a treatment of singularities, differentiation and nonlinear operations in one framework, lifting the limitations of distribution theory. These algebras have found numerous applications in the fields of partial differential equations, geophysics, microlocal analysis and general relativity so far.  Schwartz' Impossibility Result  Attempting to embed the space     𝒟  ′    (  ℝ  )        superscript  𝒟  normal-′   ℝ    \mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R})   of distributions on   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   into an associative algebra    (   A   (  ℝ  )    ,  ∘  ,  +  )       A  ℝ       (A(\mathbb{R}),\circ,+)   , the following requirements seem to be natural:        𝒟  ′    (  ℝ  )        superscript  𝒟  normal-′   ℝ    \mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R})   is linearly embedded into    A   (  ℝ  )       A  ℝ    A(\mathbb{R})   such that the constant function   1   1   1   becomes the unity in    A   (  ℝ  )       A  ℝ    A(\mathbb{R})   ,  There is a partial derivative operator   ∂     \partial   on    A   (  ℝ  )       A  ℝ    A(\mathbb{R})   which is linear and satisfies the Leibnitz rule,  the restriction of   ∂     \partial   to     𝒟  ′    (  ℝ  )        superscript  𝒟  normal-′   ℝ    \mathcal{D}^{\prime}(\mathbb{R})   coincides with the usual partial derivative,  the restriction of   ∘     \circ   to      C   (  ℝ  )    ×  C    (  ℝ  )           C  ℝ   C   ℝ    C(\mathbb{R})\times C(\mathbb{R})   coincides with the pointwise product.   However, L. Schwartz' result 1 implies that these requirements cannot hold simultaneously. The same is true even if, in 4., one replaces    C   (  ℝ  )       C  ℝ    C(\mathbb{R})   by     C  k    (  ℝ  )        superscript  C  k   ℝ    C^{k}(\mathbb{R})   , the space of   k   k   k   times continuously differentiable functions. While this result has often been interpreted as saying that a general multiplication of distributions is not possible, in fact it only states that one cannot unrestrictedly combine differentiation, multiplication of continuous functions and the presence of singular objects like the Dirac delta.  Colombeau algebras are constructed to satisfy conditions 1.-3. and a condition like 4., but with      C   (  ℝ  )    ×  C    (  ℝ  )           C  ℝ   C   ℝ    C(\mathbb{R})\times C(\mathbb{R})   replaced by       C  ∞    (  ℝ  )    ×   C  ∞     (  ℝ  )            superscript  C    ℝ    superscript  C     ℝ    C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})\times C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R})   , i.e., they preserve the product of smooth (infinitely differentiable) functions only.  Basic Idea  It is defined as a quotient algebra          C  M  ∞    (   ℝ  n   )    /   C  N  ∞     (   ℝ  n   )    .           subscript   superscript  C    M    superscript  ℝ  n     subscript   superscript  C    N     superscript  ℝ  n     C^{\infty}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})/C^{\infty}_{N}(\mathbb{R}^{n}).     Here the moderate functions on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   are defined as       C  M  ∞    (   ℝ  n   )        subscript   superscript  C    M    superscript  ℝ  n     C^{\infty}_{M}(\mathbb{R}^{n})     which are families ( f ε ) of smooth functions on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   such that      f  :    ℝ  +   →    C  ∞    (   ℝ  n   )        normal-:  f   normal-→   subscript  ℝ       superscript  C     superscript  ℝ  n       {f:}\mathbb{R}_{+}\to C^{\infty}(\mathbb{R}^{n})     (where R + =(0,∞)) is the set of " regularization " indices, and for all compact subsets K of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   and multiindices α we have N > 0 such that       sup   x  ∈  K    |    ∂   |  α  |       (   ∂   x  1    )    α  1    ⋯    (   ∂   x  n    )    α  n       f  ε    (  x  )   |  =  O   (   ε   -  N    )    (  ε  →  0  )   .     fragments   subscript  supremum    x  K    normal-|     superscript     α       superscript     subscript  x  1     subscript  α  1    normal-⋯   superscript     subscript  x  n     subscript  α  n       subscript  f  ε    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-|   O   fragments  normal-(   superscript  ε    N    normal-)   italic-   fragments  normal-(  ε  normal-→  0  normal-)   normal-.    \sup_{x\in K}\left|\frac{\partial^{|\alpha|}}{(\partial x_{1})^{\alpha_{1}}%
 \cdots(\partial x_{n})^{\alpha_{n}}}f_{\varepsilon}(x)\right|=O(\varepsilon^{-%
 N})\qquad(\varepsilon\to 0).     The ideal      C  N  ∞    (   ℝ  n   )        subscript   superscript  C    N    superscript  ℝ  n     C^{\infty}_{N}(\mathbb{R}^{n})   of negligible functions is defined in the same way but with the partial derivatives instead bounded by O( ε N ) for all  N > 0.  An introduction to Colombeau Algebras is given in here 2  Embedding of distributions  The space(s) of Schwartz distributions can be embedded into this simplified algebra by (component-wise) convolution with any element of the algebra having as representative a δ-net , i.e. such that     ϕ  ε   →  δ     normal-→   subscript  ϕ  ε   δ    \phi_{\varepsilon}\to\delta   in '' D' '' as ε→0.  This embedding is non-canonical, because it depends on the choice of the δ-net. However, there are versions of Colombeau algebras (so called full algebras) which allow for canonic embeddings of distributions. A well known full version is obtained by adding the mollifiers as second indexing set.  See also   Generalized function   Notes  References   Colombeau, J.
