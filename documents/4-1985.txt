   Gyroelongated triangular bicupola      Gyroelongated triangular bicupola   In geometry , the gyroelongated triangular bicupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 44 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by gyroelongating a triangular bicupola (either J 27 or the cuboctahedron ) by inserting a hexagonal antiprism between its congruent halves.  The gyroelongated triangular bicupola is one of five Johnson solids which are chiral , meaning that they have a "left-handed" and a "right-handed" form. In the illustration to the right, each square face on the bottom half of the figure is connected by a path of two triangular faces to a square face above it and to the right. In the figure of opposite chirality (the mirror image of the illustrated figure), each bottom square would be connected to a square face above it and to the left. The two chiral forms of J 44 are not considered different Johnson solids.  Formulae  The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    2    (    5  3   +    1  +   3      )    a  3    ≈   4.69456...   a  3          V      2       5  3       1    3       superscript  a  3           4.69456...   superscript  a  3       V=\sqrt{2}(\frac{5}{3}+\sqrt{1+\sqrt{3}})a^{3}\approx 4.69456...a^{3}       A  =    (   6  +   5   3     )    a  2    ≈   14.6603...   a  2          A      6    5    3      superscript  a  2           14.6603...   superscript  a  2       A=(6+5\sqrt{3})a^{2}\approx 14.6603...a^{2}     References  External links     "  Category:Johnson solids  Category:Chiral polyhedra     Stephen Wolfram , " Gyroelongated triangular bicupola " from Wolfram Alpha .
