3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholest-24-enoyl-CoA hydratase

In enzymology, a 3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholest-24-enoyl-CoA hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  (24E)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholest-24-enoyl-CoA + H2O
 

Thus, the substrate of this enzyme are (24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA, whereas its two products are (24E)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholest-24-enoyl-CoA and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA hydro-lyase [(24E)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha-trihydroxy-5beta-cholest-24-enoyl-CoA-forming]. Other names in common use include 46 kDa hydratase 2, and (24R,25R)-3alpha,7alpha,12alpha,24-tetrahydroxy-5beta-cholestanoyl-CoA hydro-lyase.
