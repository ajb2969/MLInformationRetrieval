   Prostaglandin-F synthase      Prostaglandin-F synthase   In enzymology , a prostaglandin-F synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,11alpha,15-trihydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,15-dihydroxy-11-oxoprosta-5,13-dienoate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,11alpha,15-trihydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,15-dihydroxy-11-oxoprosta-5,13-dienoate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (5Z,13E)-(15S)-9alpha,11alpha,15-trihydroxyprosta-5,13-dienoate:NADP + 11-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include prostaglandin-D 2 11-reductase , reductase, 15-hydroxy-11-oxoprostaglandin , PGD 2 11-ketoreductase , PGF 2α synthetase , prostaglandin 11-ketoreductase , prostaglandin D 2 -ketoreductase , prostaglandin F synthase , prostaglandin F synthetase , synthetase, prostaglandin F 2α , prostaglandin-D 2 11-reductase , PGF synthetase , NADPH-dependent prostaglandin D 2 11-keto reductase , and prostaglandin 11-keto reductase . This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism .  Structural studies  , 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
