   Gradient-related      Gradient-related   Gradient-related is a term used in multivariable calculus to describe a direction. A direction sequence    {   d  k   }      superscript  d  k     \{d^{k}\}   is gradient-related to    {   x  k   }      superscript  x  k     \{x^{k}\}   if for any subsequence     {   x  k   }    k  ∈  K      subscript    superscript  x  k      k  K     \{x^{k}\}_{k\in K}   that converges to a nonstationary point, the corresponding subsequence     {   d  k   }    k  ∈  K      subscript    superscript  d  k      k  K     \{d^{k}\}_{k\in K}   is bounded and satisfies''        lim sup    k  →  ∞   ,   k  ∈  K       ∇  f     (   x  k   )   ′    d  k     <  0.        subscript  limit-supremum   formulae-sequence   normal-→  k      k  K        normal-∇  f    superscript   superscript  x  k   normal-′    superscript  d  k     0.    \limsup_{k\rightarrow\infty,k\in K}\nabla f(x^{k})^{\prime}d^{k}<0.     A gradient-related direction is usually encountered in the gradient -based iterative optimisation of a function   f   f   f   . At each iteration   k   k   k   the current vector is    x  k     superscript  x  k    x^{k}   and we move in the direction    d  k     superscript  d  k    d^{k}   , thus generating a sequence of directions.  It is easy to guarantee that the directions we generate are gradient-related, by for example setting them equal to the gradient at each point.  "  Category:Vector calculus
