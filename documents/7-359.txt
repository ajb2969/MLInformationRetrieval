Gradient-related

Gradient-related is a term used in multivariable calculus to describe a direction. A direction sequence 
 
 
 
  is gradient-related to 
 
 
 
  if for any subsequence 
 
 
 
  that converges to a nonstationary point, the corresponding subsequence 
 
 
 
 
  is bounded and satisfies''



A gradient-related direction is usually encountered in the gradient-based iterative optimisation of a function 
 
 
 
 . At each iteration 
 
 
 
  the current vector is 
 
 
 
  and we move in the direction 
 
 
 
 
 , thus generating a sequence of directions.
It is easy to guarantee that the directions we generate are gradient-related, by for example setting them equal to the gradient at each point.
