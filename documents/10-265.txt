   Call volume (telecommunications)      Call volume (telecommunications)   In telecommunications , call volume refers to the number of telephone calls made during a certain time period. Depending on context, the phrase may refer to either the number of calls made to a specific physical area or telephone number (such as an emergency service ) or the number of calls made between two or more areas (e.g. cities).  Calls Per Second or CPS refers to how many telephone calls can be handled in a second. CPS is one measure of the performance of Switching systems .  Various formulas exist to forecast the number of calls that might be made; another key distinction concerns whether long or short-term trends are to be predicted. 1  Forecast Formulas  Perhaps the simplest formula used to forecast call volume is the linear equation       y  =    m  x   +  b    ,      y      m  x   b     y=mx+b,     where y is the expected call volume, x is time, and m and b are constants.  However, this is suitable for long-term trends only, 2 and further assumes that growth will be linear. Another formula, seen in a mathematics  textbook , 3 is the inverse square equation       C  =    0.02   P  1    P  2     d  2     ,      C      0.02   subscript  P  1    subscript  P  2     superscript  d  2      C=\frac{0.02P_{1}P_{2}}{d^{2}},     where C is the number of expected calls between two cities (during one day), P 1 is the population of the first city (in thousands), P 2 is the population of the other city (also in thousands), and d is the distance between them (units unclear in the book, but probably miles).
