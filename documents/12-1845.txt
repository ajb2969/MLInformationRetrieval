   Bondi accretion      Bondi accretion   In astrophysics , the Bondi accretion , named after Hermann Bondi , is spherical accretion onto a compact object traveling through the interstellar medium . It is generally used in the context of neutron star and black hole accretion. To achieve an approximate form of the Bondi accretion rate, accretion is assumed to occur at a rate        M  ˙   ≃   π   R  2   ρ  v    ,     similar-to-or-equals   normal-˙  M     π   superscript  R  2   ρ  v     \dot{M}\simeq\pi R^{2}\rho v,     where   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the ambient density,   v   v   v   is either the velocity of the object or the sound speed     c  s     subscript  c  s    c_{s}   in the surrounding medium if the object's velocity is lower than the sound speed, and the radius   R   R   R   provides an effective area. The effective radius is acquired by equating the object's escape velocity and the relevant speed, i.e.          2  G  M   R    ≃   c  s    ,     similar-to-or-equals        2  G  M   R     subscript  c  s     \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{R}}\simeq c_{s},     or      R  ≃    2  G  M    c  s  2       similar-to-or-equals  R      2  G  M    superscript   subscript  c  s   2      R\simeq\frac{2GM}{c_{s}^{2}}   .  The accretion rate therefore becomes       M  ˙   ≃    4  π  ρ   G  2    M  2     c  s  3       similar-to-or-equals   normal-˙  M       4  π  ρ   superscript  G  2    superscript  M  2     superscript   subscript  c  s   3      \dot{M}\simeq\frac{4\pi\rho G^{2}M^{2}}{c_{s}^{3}}   .  These are only scaling relations rather than rigorous definitions. A more complete solution can be found in Bondi's original work and two other papers.
