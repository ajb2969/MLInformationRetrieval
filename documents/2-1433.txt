   Supercompact cardinal      Supercompact cardinal   In set theory , a supercompact cardinal is a type of large cardinal . They display a variety of reflection properties.  Formal definition  If λ is any ordinal , κ is λ-supercompact means that there exists an elementary embedding j from the universe V into a transitive inner model  M with critical point κ, j (κ)>λ and        M    λ   ⊆   M    .       superscript  M  λ   M    {}^{\lambda}M\subseteq M\,.     That is, M contains all of its λ-sequences. Then κ is supercompact means that it is λ-supercompact for all ordinals λ.  Alternatively, an uncountable cardinal κ is supercompact if for every A such that | A | ≥ κ there exists a normal measure over [ A ] , in the following sense.  [ A ] is defined as follows:         [  A  ]     <  κ    :=   {   x  ⊆  A   |    |  x  |   <  κ   }    .     assign   superscript   delimited-[]  A     absent  κ     conditional-set    x  A       x   κ      [A]^{<\kappa}:=\{x\subseteq A||x|<\kappa\}\,.     An ultrafilter U over [ A ] is fine if it is κ-complete and     {   x  ∈    [  A  ]     <  κ     |   a  ∈  x   }   ∈  U       conditional-set    x   superscript   delimited-[]  A     absent  κ       a  x    U    \{x\in[A]^{<\kappa}|a\in x\}\in U   , for every    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   . A normal measure over [ A ] is a fine ultrafilter  U over [ A ] with the additional property that every function    f  :     [  A  ]     <  κ    →  A      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript   delimited-[]  A     absent  κ    A     f:[A]^{<\kappa}\to A   such that     {   x  ∈    [  A  ]     <  κ     |    f   (  x  )    ∈  x   }   ∈  U       conditional-set    x   superscript   delimited-[]  A     absent  κ         f  x   x    U    \{x\in[A]^{<\kappa}|f(x)\in x\}\in U   is constant on a set in   U   U   U   . Here "constant on a set in U " means that there is    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   such that     {   x  ∈    [  A  ]     <  κ     |    f   (  x  )    =  a   }   ∈  U       conditional-set    x   superscript   delimited-[]  A     absent  κ         f  x   a    U    \{x\in[A]^{<\kappa}|f(x)=a\}\in U   .  Properties  Supercompact cardinals have reflection properties. If a cardinal with some property (say a 3- huge cardinal ) that is witnessed by a structure of limited rank exists above a supercompact cardinal κ, then a cardinal with that property exists below κ. For example, if κ is supercompact and the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis holds below κ then it holds everywhere because a bijection between the powerset of ν and a cardinal at least ν ++ would be a witness of limited rank for the failure of GCH at ν so it would also have to exist below κ.  Finding a canonical inner model for supercompact cardinals is one of the major problems of inner model theory .  See also  Strongly compact cardinal  References       "  Category:Large cardinals
