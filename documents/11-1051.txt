   1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol transaminase      1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol transaminase   In enzymology , a 1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1D-1-guanidino-1-deoxy-3-dehydro-scyllo-inositol + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol and pyruvate , whereas its two products are 1D-1-guanidino-1-deoxy-3-dehydro-scyllo-inositol and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1D-1-guanidino-3-amino-1,3-dideoxy-scyllo-inositol:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include guanidinoaminodideoxy-scyllo-inositol-pyruvate aminotransferase , and L-alanine-N-amidino-3-(or 5-)keto-scyllo-inosamine transaminase .
