   Tate cohomology group      Tate cohomology group   In mathematics , Tate cohomology groups are a slightly modified form of the usual cohomology groups of a finite group that combine homology and cohomology groups into one sequence. They were introduced by , and are used in class field theory .  Definition  If G is a finite group and A a G -module , then there is a natural map N from H 0 ( G , A ) to H 0 ( G , A ) taking a representative a to Σ g ( a ) (the sum over all G -conjugates of a ). The Tate cohomology groups       H  ^   n    (  G  ,  A  )        superscript   normal-^  H   n    G  A     \hat{H}^{n}(G,A)   are defined by          H  ^   n    (  G  ,  A  )    =    H  n    (  G  ,  A  )           superscript   normal-^  H   n    G  A       superscript  H  n    G  A      \hat{H}^{n}(G,A)=H^{n}(G,A)   for n ≥ 1.         H  ^   0    (  G  ,  A  )    =          superscript   normal-^  H   0    G  A    absent    \hat{H}^{0}(G,A)=   quotient of H 0 ( G , A ) by norms         H  ^    -  1     (  G  ,  A  )    =          superscript   normal-^  H     1     G  A    absent    \hat{H}^{-1}(G,A)=   quotient of norm 0 elements of H 0 ( G , A ) by principal norm 0 elements         H  ^   n    (  G  ,  A  )    =    H   -   (   n  +  1   )      (  G  ,  A  )           superscript   normal-^  H   n    G  A       subscript  H      n  1      G  A      \hat{H}^{n}(G,A)=H_{-(n+1)}(G,A)   for n ≤ −2.   Properties  If      0  ⟶  A  ⟶  B  ⟶  C  ⟶  0       normal-⟶  0  A    normal-⟶    B    normal-⟶    C    normal-⟶    0     0\longrightarrow A\longrightarrow B\longrightarrow C\longrightarrow 0   is a short exact sequence of G -modules, then we get the usual long exact sequence of Tate cohomology groups:      ⋯  ⟶     H  ^   n    (  G  ,  A  )    ⟶     H  ^   n    (  G  ,  B  )    ⟶     H  ^   n    (  G  ,  C  )    ⟶     H  ^    n  +  1     (  G  ,  A  )    ⟶     H  ^    n  +  1     (  G  ,  B  )   ⋯        normal-⟶  normal-⋯     superscript   normal-^  H   n    G  A      normal-⟶       superscript   normal-^  H   n    G  B      normal-⟶       superscript   normal-^  H   n    G  C      normal-⟶       superscript   normal-^  H     n  1     G  A      normal-⟶       superscript   normal-^  H     n  1     G  B   normal-⋯      \cdots\longrightarrow\hat{H}^{n}(G,A)\longrightarrow\hat{H}^{n}(G,B)%
 \longrightarrow\hat{H}^{n}(G,C)\longrightarrow\hat{H}^{n+1}(G,A)%
 \longrightarrow\hat{H}^{n+1}(G,B)\cdots     If A is an induced G module then all Tate cohomology groups of A vanish.  The zeroth Tate cohomology group of A is   (Fixed points of G on A )/(Obvious fixed points of G acting on A )   where by the "obvious" fixed point we mean those of the form Σ g ( a ). In other words, the zeroth cohomology group in some sense describes the non-obvious fixed points of G acting on A .  The Tate cohomology groups are characterized by the three properties above.  Tate's theorem  Tate's theorem  gives conditions for multiplication by a cohomology class to be an isomorphism between cohomology groups. There are several slightly different versions of it; a version that is particularly convenient for class field theory is as follows:  Suppose that A is a module over a finite group G and a is an element of H 2 ( G , A ), such that for every subgroup E of G   H 1 ( E , A ) is trivial, and  H 2 ( E , A ) is generated by Res(a) which has order E .   Then cup product with a is an isomorphism          H  ^   n    (  G  ,  ℤ  )    ⟶     H  ^    n  +  2     (  G  ,  A  )       normal-⟶     superscript   normal-^  H   n    G  ℤ       superscript   normal-^  H     n  2     G  A      \hat{H}^{n}(G,\mathbb{Z})\longrightarrow\hat{H}^{n+2}(G,A)      for all n ; in other words the graded Tate cohomology of A is isomorphic to the Tate cohomology with integral coefficients, with the degree shifted by 2.  Tate-Farrell cohomology  Farrell extended Tate cohomology groups to the case of all groups G of finite virtual cohomological dimension . In Farrell's theory, the groups      H  ^   n    (  G  ,  A  )        superscript   normal-^  H   n    G  A     \hat{H}^{n}(G,A)   are isomorphic to the usual cohomology groups whenever n is greater than the virtual cohomological dimension of the group G . Finite groups have virtual cohomological dimension 0, and in this case Farrell's cohomology groups are the same as those of Tate.  See also   Herbrand quotient  Class formation   References   M. F.
