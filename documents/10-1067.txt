   Flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase      Flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a flavonoid 3'-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction 1   a flavonoid + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 3'-hydroxyflavonoid + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are flavonoid , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 3'-hydroxyflavonoid , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is flavonoid,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (3'-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase , flavonoid 3-hydroxylase (erroneous) , NADPH:flavonoid-3'-hydroxylase , and flavonoid 3-monooxygenase (erroneous) . This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis .
