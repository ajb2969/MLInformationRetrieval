   Dimethylmalate dehydrogenase      Dimethylmalate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a dimethylmalate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-3,3-dimethylmalate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + CO 2 + NADH   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-3,3-dimethylmalate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate , CO 2 , and NADH .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-3,3-dimethylmalate:NAD + oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme is also called beta,beta-dimethylmalate dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis . It has 5 cofactors : ammonia , manganese , cobalt , potassium , and NH 4 + .
