   Roshko number      Roshko number   In fluid mechanics , the Roshko number ( Ro ) is a dimensionless number describing oscillating flow mechanisms. It is named after the American Professor of Aeronautics Anatol Roshko . It is defined as      Ro  =    f   L  2    ν   =    St   Re         Ro      f   superscript  L  2    ν          St  Re      \mathrm{Ro}={fL^{2}\over\nu}=\mathrm{St}\,\mathrm{Re}     where   St is the dimensionless Strouhal number ;  Re is the Reynolds number ;  f is the frequency of vortex  shedding ;  L is the characteristic length (for example hydraulic diameter );  ν is the kinematic viscosity of the fluid.
