   Purine imidazole-ring cyclase      Purine imidazole-ring cyclase   In enzymology , a purine imidazole-ring cyclase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   DNA 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   DNA adenine + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , DNA 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine , and two products , DNA adenine and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically amidine lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is DNA-4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine C8-N9-lyase (cyclizing DNA-adenine-forming) . Other names in common use include DNA-4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine 8-C,9-N-lyase (cyclizing) , DNA-4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine 8-C,9-N-lyase (cyclizing , and DNA-adenine-forming) .
