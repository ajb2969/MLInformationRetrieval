   Guanylate kinase      Guanylate kinase   In enzymology , a guanylate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + GMP    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    ADP + GDP    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and GMP , whereas its two products are ADP and GDP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a phosphate group as acceptor. This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Guanylate kinase catalyzes the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of GMP into GDP. 1 It is essential for recycling GMP and indirectly, cGMP. In prokaryotes (such as Escherichia coli), lower eukaryotes (such as yeast) and in vertebrates, GK is a highly conserved monomeric protein of about 200 amino acids. GK has been shown to be structurally similar to protein A57R (or SalG2R) from various strains of Vaccinia virus. 2 3 4  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:(d)GMP phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include"   deoxyguanylate kinase,  5'-GMP kinase,  GMP kinase,  guanosine monophosphate kinase, and  ATP:GMP phosphotransferase.
