Kaempferol 3-O-galactosyltransferase

In enzymology, a kaempferol 3-O-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-galactose + kaempferol 
 
 
 
  UDP + kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-galactoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and kaempferol, whereas its two products are UDP and kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-galactoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:kaempferol 3-O-beta-D-galactosyltransferase. This enzyme is also called F3GalTase.
