<h1>List of military nuclear accidents</h1>
<hr/>

<p>This article lists notable military accidents involving nuclear material. Civilian accidents are listed at <a href="List_of_civilian_nuclear_accidents" title="wikilink">List of civilian nuclear accidents</a>. For a general discussion of both civilian and military accidents, see <a href="nuclear_and_radiation_accidents" title="wikilink">nuclear and radiation accidents</a>. </p>
<h2 id="scope-of-this-article">Scope of this article</h2>

<p>In listing military nuclear accidents, the following criteria have been adopted:</p>
<ol>
<li>There must be well-attested and substantial health damage, property damage or contamination.</li>
<li>The damage must be related directly to radioactive material, not merely (for example) at a nuclear power plant.</li>
<li>To qualify as "military", the nuclear operation/material must be principally for military purposes.</li>
<li>To qualify as "accident", the damage should not be intentional, unlike in <a href="nuclear_warfare" title="wikilink">nuclear warfare</a>.</li>
</ol>

<li>June 23, 1942 – <a class="uri" href="Leipzig" title="wikilink">Leipzig</a>, <a class="uri" href="Germany" title="wikilink">Germany</a> (then <a href="Nazi_Germany" title="wikilink">Nazi Germany</a>) – Steam explosion and reactor fire
<ul>
<li>Shortly after the Leipzig L-IV <a href="atomic_pile" title="wikilink">atomic pile</a> — worked on by <a href="Werner_Heisenberg" title="wikilink">Werner Heisenberg</a> and <a href="Robert_Doepel" title="wikilink">Robert Doepel</a> — demonstrated Germany's first signs of neutron propagation, the device was checked for a possible <a href="heavy_water" title="wikilink">heavy water</a> leak. During the inspection, air leaked in, igniting the uranium powder inside. The burning uranium boiled the water jacket, generating enough steam pressure to blow the reactor apart. Burning uranium powder scattered throughout the lab causing a larger fire at the facility.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a><ref></ref></li>

<li>August 21, 1945 – <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>, <a href="Los_Alamos,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Los Alamos, New Mexico</a>, <a class="uri" href="USA" title="wikilink">USA</a> – Accidental criticality
<ul>
<li><a href="Harry_K._Daghlian,_Jr." title="wikilink">Harry K. Daghlian, Jr.</a> dropped a <a href="tungsten_carbide" title="wikilink">tungsten carbide</a> brick onto a <a class="uri" href="plutonium" title="wikilink">plutonium</a> core, inadvertently creating a <a href="criticality_accident" title="wikilink">critical mass</a> at the Los Alamos Omega site. He quickly removed the brick, but was fatally <a href="radiation_poisoning" title="wikilink">irradiated</a>, dying September 15.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>May 21, 1946 – <a href="Los_Alamos_National_Laboratory" title="wikilink">Los Alamos National Laboratory</a>, Los Alamos, <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a>, USA – Accidental criticality
<ul>
<li>While demonstrating his technique to visiting scientists at Los Alamos, Canadian <a href="Nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">physicist</a> <a href="Louis_Slotin" title="wikilink">Louis Slotin</a> manually assembled a <a href="critical_mass_(nuclear)" title="wikilink">critical mass</a> of <a class="uri" href="plutonium" title="wikilink">plutonium</a>. A momentary slip of a screwdriver caused a <a href="prompt_critical" title="wikilink">prompt critical</a> reaction. Slotin died on May 30 from massive radiation poisoning, with an estimated dose of 1,000 <a href="rad_(unit)" title="wikilink">rads</a> (rad), or 10 <a href="gray_(unit)" title="wikilink">grays</a> (Gy). Seven observers, who received doses as high as 166 rads, survived, yet three died within a few decades from conditions believed to be radiation-related.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>In the above incidents, both Daghlian (August 21, 1945 case) and Slotin (May 21, 1946 case), were working with the same bomb core which became known as the "<a href="demon_core" title="wikilink">demon core</a>", which was eventually utilized for the <a href="Operation_Crossroads#Test_Able" title="wikilink"><em>Able</em> test detonation</a> on July 1, 1946.</p>

<li>February 13, 1950 – <a href="Pacific_Ocean" title="wikilink">Pacific Ocean</a>, off Coast of <a href="British_Columbia" title="wikilink">British Columbia</a> – Non-nuclear detonation of an atomic bomb
<ul>
<li>A USAF <a href="B-36_bomber" title="wikilink">B-36 bomber</a>, <a href="B-36B_44-92075" title="wikilink">AF Ser. No. 44-92075</a>, was flying a simulated combat mission from <a href="Eielson_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Eielson Air Force Base</a>, near <a href="Fairbanks,_Alaska" title="wikilink">Fairbanks, Alaska</a>, to <a href="Carswell_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Carswell Air Force Base</a> in <a href="Fort_Worth,_Texas" title="wikilink">Fort Worth, Texas</a>, carrying one weapon containing a dummy warhead. The warhead contained uranium instead of plutonium. After six hours of flight, the bomber experienced mechanical problems and was forced to shut down three of its six engines at an altitude of . Fearing that severe weather and icing would jeopardize a safe emergency landing, the weapon was jettisoned over the Pacific Ocean from a height of . The weapon's <a href="high_explosive" title="wikilink">high explosives</a> detonated upon impact with a bright flash visible. All of the sixteen crew members and one passenger were able to parachute from the plane and twelve were subsequently rescued from <a href="Princess_Royal_Island" title="wikilink">Princess Royal Island</a>. The Pentagon's summary report does not mention if the weapon was later recovered.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>

<li>April 11, 1950 – <a href="Albuquerque,_New_Mexico" title="wikilink">Albuquerque, New Mexico</a>, USA – Loss and recovery of nuclear materials
<ul>
<li>Three minutes after departure from <a href="Kirtland_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Kirtland Air Force Base</a> in Albuquerque a USAF <a href="Boeing_B-29_Superfortress" title="wikilink">B-29 bomber</a> carrying a nuclear weapon, four spare detonators, and a crew of thirteen crashed into a mountain near Manzano Base. The crash resulted in a fire which the <em><a href="New_York_Times" title="wikilink">New York Times</a></em> reported as being visible from . The bomb's casing was completely demolished and its high explosives ignited upon contact with the plane's burning fuel. However, according to the Department of Defense, the four spare detonators and all nuclear components were recovered. A nuclear detonation was not possible because, while on board, the weapon's core was not in the weapon for safety reasons. All thirteen crew members died.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></li>

In the resulting fire, the bomb's high explosive material exploded, killing nineteen people from the crew and rescue personnel. Brigadier General <a href="Robert_F._Travis" title="wikilink">Robert F. Travis</a> was among the dead.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></li>

<li>March 1, 1954 – <a href="Bikini_Atoll" title="wikilink">Bikini Atoll</a>, <a href="Marshall_Islands" title="wikilink">Republic of the Marshall Islands</a> (then <a href="Trust_Territory_of_the_Pacific_Islands" title="wikilink">Trust Territory of the Pacific Islands</a>) – Nuclear test accident
<ul>
<li>During the <a href="Castle_Bravo_test" title="wikilink">Castle Bravo test</a> of the first deployable <a href="Thermonuclear_weapon" title="wikilink">hydrogen bomb</a>, a miscalculation resulted in the explosion being over twice as large as predicted, with a total explosive force of . Of the total yield,  were from fission of the natural uranium tamper, but those fission reactions were quite dirty, producing a large amount of <a href="Nuclear_fallout" title="wikilink">fallout</a>. Combined with the much larger than expected yield and an unanticipated wind shift <a href="nuclear_radiation" title="wikilink">radioactive</a> fallout was spread eastward onto the inhabited <a href="Rongelap_Atoll" title="wikilink">Rongelap</a> and <a href="Rongerik_Atoll" title="wikilink">Rongerik Atolls</a>. These islands were not evacuated before the explosion due to the financial cost involved, but many of the <a href="Marshall_Islands" title="wikilink">Marshall Islands</a> natives have since suffered from radiation burns and radioactive <a href="dust" title="wikilink">dusting</a> and also similar fates as the Japanese fishermen and have received little, if any, compensation from the <a href="U.S._government" title="wikilink">federal government</a>. A Japanese fishing boat, the <em><a href="Daigo_Fukuryū_Maru" title="wikilink">Daigo Fukuryu Maru/Lucky Dragon</a></em>, also came into contact with the fallout, which caused many of the crew to become ill, with one fatality. The test resulted in an international uproar and reignited Japanese concerns about radiation, especially with regard to the possible <a href="Radioactive_contamination" title="wikilink">contamination</a> of fish. Personal accounts of the Rongelap people can be seen in the documentary <em><a href="Children_of_Armageddon" title="wikilink">Children of Armageddon</a></em>.</li>

<ul>
<li>A USAF <a class="uri" href="B-47" title="wikilink">B-47</a> crashed into a storage igloo spreading burning fuel over three <a href="Mark_6_nuclear_bomb" title="wikilink">Mark 6 nuclear bombs</a> at <a href="RAF_Lakenheath" title="wikilink">RAF Lakenheath</a>. A bomb disposal expert stated it was a miracle exposed detonators on one bomb did not fire, which presumably would have released nuclear material into the environment.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></li>

<li>May 22, 1957 – <a href="Kirtland_AFB" title="wikilink">Kirtland AFB</a> in <a href="New_Mexico" title="wikilink">New Mexico</a>, USA – Non-nuclear detonation of an atomic weapon
<ul>
<li>A B-36 ferrying a nuclear weapon from Biggs AFB to Kirtland AFB dropped a nuclear weapon on approach to Kirtland AFB. The weapon struck the ground 4.5 miles south of the Kirtland control tower and 0.3 miles west of the Sandia Base reservation. The weapon was completely destroyed by the detonation of its high explosive material, creating a crater 12 feet deep and 25 feet in diameter. Radioactive contamination at the crater lip amounted to 0.5 <a class="uri" href="milliroentgen" title="wikilink">milliroentgen</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>

<li>September 11, 1957 – <a href="Rocky_Flats_Plant" title="wikilink">Rocky Flats Plant</a>, <a href="Golden,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Golden, Colorado</a>, USA – Fire, release of nuclear materials
<ul>
<li>A fire began in a theoretically fireproof area inside the plutonium processing building, in a materials handling <a href="glovebox" title="wikilink">glove box</a> and spread through the ventilation system into the <a href="stack_filter" title="wikilink">stack filters</a> at the Rocky Flats weapons mill  from <a href="Denver,_Colorado" title="wikilink">Denver, Colorado</a>. The fire quickly spread to the plutonium as various safety features failed. As the containment ability of the facility became compromised, plumes of radioactive smoke were sent high into the air. The fire raged inside the building for 13 hours over the night of the 11th &amp; 12th before firefighters could finally extinguish it. In the aftermath, Department of Energy officials, and the Dow Chemical officials who ran the facility, did not admit the extent of the catastrophe, or the radiation danger, to local officials or the media. Knowledge of the extent of the damage and contamination was kept from the public for years. After the fire, plutonium was detected 30 miles from the plant - heavily contaminating the region, including a school 12 miles away, as well as including Denver and its environs. An independent group of scientists conducting off-site testing 13 years later found plutonium contamination in areas in nearby Rocky Flats to be 400 to 1,500 times higher than normal, higher than any ever recorded near any urban area, including Nagasaki. The Atomic Energy Commission then conducted its own off-site study, and that study confirmed plutonium contamination as far as thirty miles from the plant.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></li>

<ul>
<li><em>See <a href="Kyshtym_disaster" title="wikilink">Kyshtym disaster</a></em>. A cooling system failure at the <a class="uri" href="Mayak" title="wikilink">Mayak</a> nuclear processing plant resulted in a major explosion and release of radioactive materials. A large area was subjected to radioactive contamination and thousands of local inhabitants were evacuated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a></li>
</ul></li>
<li>October 8–12, 1957 – <a class="uri" href="Sellafield" title="wikilink">Sellafield</a>, <a class="uri" href="Cumbria" title="wikilink">Cumbria</a>, UK – Reactor core fire
<ul>
<li><em>See <a href="Windscale_fire" title="wikilink">Windscale fire</a></em>. Technicians mistakenly overheated Windscale <a href="Pile_(nuclear_reactor)" title="wikilink">Pile</a> No. 1 during an <a href="annealing_(metallurgy)" title="wikilink">annealing</a> process to release <a href="Wigner_energy" title="wikilink">Wigner energy</a> from <a class="uri" href="graphite" title="wikilink">graphite</a> portions of the reactor. Poorly placed temperature sensors indicated the reactor was cooling rather than heating. The excess heat led to the failure of a nuclear cartridge, which in turn allowed uranium and irradiated graphite to react with air. The resulting fire burned for days, damaging a significant portion of the reactor core. About 150 burning fuel cells could not be lifted from the core, but operators succeeded in creating a <a class="uri" href="firebreak" title="wikilink">firebreak</a> by removing nearby fuel cells. An effort to cool the graphite core with water eventually quenched the fire. The reactor had released radioactive gases into the surrounding countryside, primarily in the form of <a class="uri" href="iodine-131" title="wikilink">iodine-131</a> (<sup>131</sup>I). <a class="uri" href="Milk" title="wikilink">Milk</a> distribution was banned in a  area around the reactor for several weeks. A 1987 report by the National Radiological Protection Board predicted the accident would cause as many as 33 long-term cancer deaths, although the Medical Research Council Committee concluded that "it is in the highest degree unlikely that any harm has been done to the health of anybody, whether a worker in the Windscale plant or a member of the general public." The reactor that burned was one of two air-cooled, graphite-moderated natural uranium reactors at the site used for production of <a class="uri" href="plutonium" title="wikilink">plutonium</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></li>

<ul>
<li><em>See <a href="1958_Tybee_Island_mid-air_collision" title="wikilink">1958 Tybee Island mid-air collision</a></em>. A USAF B-47 bomber jettisoned a <a href="Mark_15_nuclear_bomb" title="wikilink">Mark 15 Mod 0 nuclear bomb</a> over the Atlantic Ocean after a <a href="midair_collision" title="wikilink">midair collision</a> with a USAF <a href="North_American_F-86_Sabre" title="wikilink">F-86 Sabre</a> during a simulated combat mission from <a href="Homestead_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Homestead Air Force Base</a>, Florida. The F-86's pilot <a href="ejection_seat" title="wikilink">ejected</a> and <a href="parachute" title="wikilink">parachuted</a> to safety. The USAF claimed the B-47 tried landing at <a href="Hunter_Air_Force_Base" title="wikilink">Hunter Air Force Base</a>, Georgia three times before the bomb was jettisoned at  near <a href="Tybee_Island,_Georgia" title="wikilink">Tybee Island</a>, <a href="Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="wikilink">Georgia</a>. The B-47 pilot successfully landed in one attempt only after he first jettisoned the bomb. A  area near <a href="Wassaw_Sound" title="wikilink">Wassaw Sound</a> was searched for nine weeks before the search was called off. The bomb was searched for in 2001 and not found. A group of investigators in 2004 claimed to have found an underwater object which they think is the bomb.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></li>

Six percent of the explosion's radioactive products were vented. The plume released 6.7 MCi of radioactive material, including 80 kCi of <a class="uri" href="Iodine-131" title="wikilink">Iodine-131</a> and a high ratio of noble gases.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> After dropping a portion of its load in the area, the hot cloud's lighter particles were carried to three altitudes and conveyed by winter storms and the jet stream to be deposited heavily as <a class="uri" href="radionuclide" title="wikilink">radionuclide</a>-laden snow in <a href="Lassen_County,_California" title="wikilink">Lassen</a> and <a href="Sierra_County,_California" title="wikilink">Sierra</a> counties in northeast California, and to lesser degrees in northern Nevada, southern Idaho and some eastern sections of Oregon and Washington states.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> The three diverging jet stream layers conducted radionuclides across the US to Canada, the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic Ocean. Some 86 workers at the site were exposed to radioactivity, but according to the Department of Energy none received a dose exceeding site guidelines and, similarly, radiation drifting offsite was not considered to pose a hazard by the DOE.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> In March 2009, <a href="TIME_magazine" title="wikilink">TIME magazine</a> identified the Baneberry Test as one of the world's worst nuclear disasters.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a></li>
