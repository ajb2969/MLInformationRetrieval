   2-hydroxyglutarate synthase      2-hydroxyglutarate synthase   In enzymology , a 2-hydroxyglutarate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   propanoyl-CoA + H 2 O + glyoxylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-hydroxyglutarate + CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are propanoyl-CoA , H 2 O , and glyoxylate , whereas its two products are 2-hydroxyglutarate and CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases that convert acyl groups into alkyl groups on transfer. The systematic name of this enzyme class is propanoyl-CoA:glyoxylate C-propanoyltransferase (thioester-hydrolysing, 2-carboxyethyl-forming) . Other names in common use include 2-hydroxyglutaratic synthetase , 2-hydroxyglutaric synthetase , alpha-hydroxyglutarate synthase , hydroxyglutarate synthase , and 2-hydroxyglutarate glyoxylate-lyase (CoA-propanoylating) . This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism .
