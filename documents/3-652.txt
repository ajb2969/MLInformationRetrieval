   Brauer group      Brauer group   In mathematics , the Brauer group of a field  K is an abelian group whose elements are Morita equivalence classes of central simple algebras of finite rank over K and addition is induced by the tensor product of algebras. It arose out of attempts to classify division algebras over a field and is named after the algebraist Richard Brauer . The group may also be defined in terms of Galois cohomology . More generally, the Brauer group of a scheme is defined in terms of Azumaya algebras .  Construction  A central simple algebra (CSA) over a field K is a finite-dimensional associative K -algebra  A , which is a simple ring , and for which the center is exactly K . Note that CSAs are in general not division algebras, though CSAs can be used to classify division algebras.  For example, the complex numbers C form a CSA over themselves, but not over R (the center is C itself, hence too large to be CSA over R ). The finite-dimensional division algebras with center R (that means the dimension over R is finite) are the real numbers and the quaternions by a theorem of Frobenius , while any matrix ring over the reals or quaternions – M( n , R ) or M( n , H ) – is a CSA over the reals, but not a division algebra (if    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   ).  We obtain an equivalence relation on CSAs over K by the Artin–Wedderburn theorem ( Wedderburn 's part, in fact), to express any CSA as a M( n , D ) for some division algebra D . If we look just at D , that is, if we impose an equivalence relation identifying M( m , D ) with M( n , D ) for all integers m and n at least 1, we get the Brauer equivalence and the Brauer classes .  Given central simple algebras A and B , one can look at the their tensor product A ⊗ B as a K -algebra (see tensor product of R-algebras ). It turns out that this is always central simple. A slick way to see this is to use a characterisation: a central simple algebra over K is a K -algebra that becomes a matrix ring when we extend the field of scalars to an algebraic closure of K .  Given this closure property for CSAs, they form a monoid under tensor product, compatible with Brauer equivalence, and the Brauer classes are all invertible : the inverse class to that of an algebra A is the one containing the opposite algebra  A op (the opposite ring with the same action by K since the image of K → A is in the center of A ). In other words, for a CSA A we have A ⊗ A op = M( n 2 , K ), where n is the degree of A over K . (This provides a substantial reason for caring about the notion of an opposite algebra: it provides the inverse in the Brauer group.)  Examples   In the following cases, every finite-dimensional central division algebra over a field K is K itself, so that the Brauer group Br( K ) is trivial :     K is an algebraically closed field : 1 more generally, this is true for any pseudo algebraically closed field 2 or quasi-algebraically closed field . 3      K is a finite field ( Wedderburn's theorem ); 4 5      K is the function field of an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field ( Tsen's theorem ); 6      An algebraic extension of Q containing all roots of unity . 7     The Brauer group Br( R ) of the field R of real numbers is the cyclic group of order two. There are just two non-isomorphic real division algebras with center R : the algebra R itself and the quaternion algebra H . 8 Since H ⊗ H ≅ M(4, R ), the class of H has order two in the Brauer group. More generally, any real closed field has Brauer group of order two. 9    K is complete under a discrete valuation with finite residue field. Br( K ) is isomorphic to Q / Z . 10   Brauer group and class field theory  The notion of Brauer group plays an important role in the modern formulation of the class field theory . If K v is a non-archimedean local field , the Hasse invariants gives a canonical isomorphism inv v : Br( K v ) → Q / Z constructed in local class field theory . 11 12 13 An element of the Brauer group of order n can be represented by a cyclic division algebra of dimension n 2 . 14  The case of a global field  K is addressed by the global class field theory . If D is a central simple algebra over K and v is a valuation then D ⊗ K v is a central simple algebra over K v , the local completion of K at v . This defines a homomorphism from the Brauer group of K into the Brauer group of K v . A given central simple algebra D splits for all but finitely many v , so that the image of D under almost all such homomorphisms is 0. The Brauer group Br( K ) fits into an exact sequence 15 16       0  →   Br   (  K  )    →    ⊕   v  ∈  S     Br   (   K  v   )     →   𝐐  /  𝐙   →  0   ,       normal-→  0    Br  K     normal-→      subscript  direct-sum    v  S      Br   subscript  K  v       normal-→      𝐐  𝐙     normal-→    0     0\rightarrow\textrm{Br}(K)\rightarrow\bigoplus_{v\in S}\textrm{Br}(K_{v})%
 \rightarrow\mathbf{Q}/\mathbf{Z}\rightarrow 0,     where S is the set of all valuations of K and the right arrow is the direct sum of the local invariants: the Brauer group of the real numbers is identified with (1/2) Z / Z . The injectivity of the left arrow is the content of the Albert–Brauer–Hasse–Noether theorem . Exactness in the middle term is a deep fact from the global class field theory. The group Q / Z on the right may be interpreted as the "Brauer group" of the class formation of idele classes associated to K .  Properties   Base change from a field K to an extension field  L gives a restriction map from Br( K ) to Br( L ). The kernel is the group Br( L / K ) of classes of K -algebras that split over L .  The Brauer group of any field is a torsion group. 17   General theory  For an arbitrary field K , the Brauer group may be expressed in terms of Galois cohomology as follows: 18        Br   (  K  )    ≅    H  2    (   Gal   (    K  s   /  K   )    ,   K   s   *   )     .        Br  K      superscript  H  2      Gal     superscript  K  s   K     superscript   superscript  K  s         \textrm{Br}(K)\cong H^{2}(\textrm{Gal}(K^{s}/K),{K^{s}}^{*}).     Here, K s is the separable closure of K , which coincides with the algebraic closure when K is a perfect field . Note that every finite dimensional central simple algebra has a separable splitting field. 19  The isomorphism of the Brauer group with a Galois cohomology group can be described as follows. If D is a division algebra over K of dimension n 2 containing a Galois extension L of degree n over K , then the subgroup of elements of D * that normalize L is an extension of the Galois group Gal( L / K ) by the nonzero elements L * of L , so corresponds to an element of H 2 (Gal( L / K ), L *).  A generalisation of the Brauer group to the case of commutative rings was introduced by Maurice Auslander and Oscar Goldman , 20 and more generally for schemes by Alexander Grothendieck . In their approach, central simple algebras over a field are replaced with Azumaya algebras . 21  See also   Algebraic K-theory   Notes  References              Further reading     External links   PlanetMath page  MathWorld page   "  Category:Ring theory  Category:Algebraic number theory     Lorenz (2008) p.164 ↩  ↩  Serre (1979) p.161 ↩   Serre (1979) p.162 ↩    Serre (1979) p.163 ↩    Lorenz (2008) p.232 ↩  Serre (1967) p.137 ↩  Shatz (1972) p.155 ↩  Lorenz (2008) p.226 ↩   Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.159 ↩  Lorenz (2008) p.194 ↩  Serre (1979) pp.157-159 ↩  Jacobson (1996) p.93 ↩  ↩  Saltman (1999) p.21 ↩
