Quintic threefold

In mathematics, a quintic threefold is a degree 5 dimension 3 hypersurface in 4-dimensional projective space. Non-singular quintic threefolds are Calabi–Yau manifolds.

Rational curves
conjectured that the number of rational curves of a given degree on a generic quintic threefold is finite. (Some smooth but non-generic quintic threefolds have infinite families of lines on them.) This was verified for degrees up to 7 by  who also calculated the number 609250 of degree 2 rational curves.  conjectured a general formula for the virtual number of rational curves of any degree, which was proved by  (the fact that the virtual number equals the actual number relies on confirmation of Clemens' conjecture, currently known for degree at most 11 ). The number of rational curves of various degrees on a generic quintic threefold is given by

5, 2875, 609250, 317206375, 242467530000, ....
 

Since the generic quintic threefold is a Calabi–Yau threefold and the moduli space of rational curves of a given degree is a discrete, finite set (hence compact), these have well-defined Donaldson–Thomas invariants (the "virtual number of points"); at least for degree 1 and 2, these agree with the actual number of points.
