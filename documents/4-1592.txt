   Vitali–Hahn–Saks theorem      Vitali–Hahn–Saks theorem   In mathematics , the Vitali–Hahn–Saks theorem , introduced by , , and , states that given μ n for each integer n >0, a countably additive function defined on a fixed sigma-algebra Σ, with values in a given Banach space  B , such that        lim   n  →  ∞      μ  n    (  X  )     =   μ   (  X  )          subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  μ  n   X      μ  X     \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\mu_{n}(X)=\mu(X)     exists for every set X in Σ, then μ is also countably additive. In other words, the limit of a sequence of vector measures is a vector measure.  References         "  Category:Theorems in measure theory
