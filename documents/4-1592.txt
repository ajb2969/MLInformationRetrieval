Vitali–Hahn–Saks theorem

In mathematics, the Vitali–Hahn–Saks theorem, introduced by , , and , states that given μn for each integer n >0, a countably additive function defined on a fixed sigma-algebra Σ, with values in a given Banach space B, such that



exists for every set X in Σ, then μ is also countably additive. In other words, the limit of a sequence of vector measures is a vector measure.
