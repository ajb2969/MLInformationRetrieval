In mathematics, the Wright omega function or Wright function,1 denoted ω, is defined in terms of the Lambert W function as:



Uses
One of the main applications of this function is in the resolution of the equation z = ln(z), as the only solution is given by z = e−ω(π i).
y = ω(z) is the unique solution, when 
 
 
 
 
  for x ≤ −1, of the equation y + ln(y) = z. Except on those two rays, the Wright omega function is continuous, even analytic.
Properties
The Wright omega function satisfies the relation 
 
 
 
 .
It also satisfies the differential equation



wherever ω is analytic (as can be seen by performing separation of variables and recovering the equation 
 
 
 
 ), and as a consequence its integral can be expressed as:



Its Taylor series around the point 
 
 
 
  takes the form :



where



in which



is a second-order Eulerian number.
