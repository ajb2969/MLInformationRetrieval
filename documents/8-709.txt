   Elliptic unit      Elliptic unit   In mathematics , elliptic units are certain units of abelian extensions of imaginary quadratic fields constructed using singular values of modular functions , or division values of elliptic functions . They were introduced by Gilles Robert in 1973, and were used by John Coates and Andrew Wiles in their work on the Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer conjecture . Elliptic units are an analogue for imaginary quadratic fields of cyclotomic units . They form an example of an Euler system .  A system of elliptic units may be constructed for an elliptic curve  E with complex multiplication by the ring of integers  R of an imaginary quadratic field F . For simplicity we assume that F has class number one. Let a be an ideal of R with generator α. For a Weierstrass model of E , define        Θ  𝐚   =    α   -  12     Δ  E    N  𝐚   -  1      ∏     𝐚  P   =  0   ,   P  ≠  0        (   x  -   x   (  P  )     )    -  6        .       subscript  normal-Θ  𝐚      superscript  α    12     superscript   subscript  normal-Δ  E       N  𝐚   1      subscript  product   formulae-sequence      𝐚  P   0     P  0      superscript    x    x  P      6        \Theta_{\mathbf{a}}=\alpha^{-12}\Delta_{E}^{N\mathbf{a}-1}\prod_{\mathbf{a}P=0%
 ,P\neq 0}(x-x(P))^{-6}\ .     where Δ is the discriminant and x is the X-coordinate on the Weierstrass model. The function Θ is independent of the choice of model, and is defined over the field of definition of E .  Let b be an ideal of R coprime to a and Q an R -generator of the b -torsion. Then Θ a ( Q ) is defined over the ray class field  K ( b ), and if b is not a prime power then Θ a ( Q ) is a global unit: if b is a power of a prime p then Θ a ( Q ) is a unit away from p .  The function Θ a satisfies a distribution relation for b = (β) coprime to a :         ∏    𝐛  Q   =  0      Θ  𝐚    (   P  +  R   )     =    Θ  𝐚    (   β  P   )     .        subscript  product      𝐛  Q   0       subscript  normal-Θ  𝐚     P  R        subscript  normal-Θ  𝐚     β  P      \prod_{\mathbf{b}Q=0}\Theta_{\mathbf{a}}(P+R)=\Theta_{\mathbf{a}}(\beta P)\ .
