Brauner space

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics Brauner space is a complete compactly generated locally convex space

 
  having a sequence of compact sets 
 
 
 
  such that every other compact set 
 
 
 
  is contained in some 
 
 
 
 .
Brauner spaces are named after Kalman Brauner,1 who first started to study them. All Brauner spaces are stereotype and are in the stereotype duality relations with Fréchet spaces:23
:* for any Fréchet space 
 
 
 
  its stereotype dual space4

 
  is a Brauner space,
:* and vice versa, for any Brauner space 
 
 
 
  its stereotype dual space 
 
 
 
  is a Fréchet space.
Examples

Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
 -compact locally compact topological space, and 
 
 
 
  the space of all functions on 
 
 
 
  (with values in 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 ), endowed with the usual topology of uniform convergence on compact sets in 
 
 
 
 . The dual space 
 
 
 
  of measures with compact support in 
 
 
 
  with the topology of uniform convergence on compact sets in 
 
 
 
  is a Brauner space.


Let 
 
 
 
  be a smooth manifold, and 
 
 
 
  the space of smooth functions on 
 
 
 
  (with values in 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 ), endowed with the usual topology of uniform convergence with each derivative on compact sets in 
 
 
 
 . The dual space 
 
 
 
  of distributions with compact support in 
 
 
 
  with the topology of uniform convergence on bounded sets in 
 
 
 
  is a Brauner space.


Let 
 
 
 
  be a Stein manifold and 
 
 
 
  the space of holomorphic functions on 
 
 
 
  with the usual topology of uniform convergence on compact sets in 
 
 
 
 . The dual space 
 
 
 
  of analytic functionals on 
 
 
 
  with the topology of uniform convergence on biunded sets in 
 
 
 
  is a Brauner space.


Let 
 
 
 
  be a compactly generated Stein group. The space 
 
 
 
  of holomorphic functions of exponential type on 
 
 
 
  is a Brauner space with respect to a natural topology.5
