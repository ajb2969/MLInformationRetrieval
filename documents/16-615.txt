   Brauner space      Brauner space   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics  Brauner space is a complete  compactly generated  locally convex space    X   X   X   having a sequence of compact sets    K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   such that every other compact set    T  ⊆  X      T  X    T\subseteq X   is contained in some    K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   .  Brauner spaces are named after Kalman Brauner, 1 who first started to study them. All Brauner spaces are stereotype and are in the stereotype duality relations with Fréchet spaces : 2 3  :* for any Fréchet space   X   X   X   its stereotype dual space 4     X  ⋆     superscript  X  normal-⋆    X^{\star}   is a Brauner space,  :* and vice versa, for any Brauner space   X   X   X   its stereotype dual space    X  ⋆     superscript  X  normal-⋆    X^{\star}   is a Fréchet space.
