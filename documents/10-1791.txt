S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione synthase




S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione synthase

In enzymology, a S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione 
 
 
 
  glutathione + formaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione, and two products, glutathione and formaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione formaldehyde-lyase (glutathione-forming). Other names in common use include glutathione-dependent formaldehyde-activating enzyme, Gfa, and S-(hydroxymethyl)glutathione formaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in methane metabolism.
