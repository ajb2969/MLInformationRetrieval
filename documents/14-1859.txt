   Typing environment      Typing environment   In type theory a typing environment (or variable assignment ) represents the association between variables names and data types . More formally an environment   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is a set or ordered list of pairs    ⟨  x  ,  τ  ⟩     x  τ    \langle x,\tau\rangle   , usually written as    x  :  τ     normal-:  x  τ    x:\tau   , where   x   x   x   is a variable and   τ   τ   \tau   its type.  In statically typed  programming languages these environments are used and maintained by type rules to type check a given program or expression.
