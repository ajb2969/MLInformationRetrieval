Typing environment

In type theory a typing environment (or variable assignment) represents the association between variables names and data types. More formally an environment 
 
 
 
  is a set or ordered list of pairs 
 
 
 
 , usually written as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a variable and 
 
 
 
 
  its type.
In statically typed programming languages these environments are used and maintained by type rules to type check a given program or expression.
