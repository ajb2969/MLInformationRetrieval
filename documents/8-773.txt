Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo

In computational statistics, reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo is an extension to standard Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methodology that allows simulation of the posterior distribution on spaces of varying dimensions.1 Thus, the simulation is possible even if the number of parameters in the model is not known.
Let



be a model indicator and 
 
 
 
  the parameter space whose number of dimensions 
 
 
 
  depends on the model 
 
 
 
 . The model indication need not be finite. The stationary distribution is the joint posterior distribution of 
 
 
 
  that takes the values 
 
 
 
 .
The proposal 
 
 
 
  can be constructed with a mapping

 
  of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is drawn from a random component 
 
 
 
  with density 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . The move to state 
 
 
 
  can thus be formulated as



The function



must be one to one and differentiable, and have a non-zero support:



so that there exists an inverse function



that is differentiable. Therefore, the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  must be of equal dimension, which is the case if the dimension criterion



is met where 
 
 
 
  is the dimension of 
 
 
 
 . This is known as dimension matching.
If 
 
 
 
  then the dimensional matching condition can be reduced to



with



The acceptance probability will be given by



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the absolute value and 
 
 
 
  is the joint posterior probability



where 
 
 
 
  is the normalising constant.
