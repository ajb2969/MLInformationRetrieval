<h1>Rational homotopy theory</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In mathematics, <strong>rational homotopy theory</strong> is the study of the rational homotopy type of a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">space</a>, which means roughly that one ignores all <a href="Torsion_(algebra)" title="wikilink">torsion</a> in the <a href="homotopy_group" title="wikilink">homotopy groups</a>. It was started by  and .</p>

<p>Rational homotopy types of simply connected spaces can be identified with (isomorphism classes of) certain algebraic objects called minimal Sullivan algebras, which are <a href="Commutativity" title="wikilink">commutative</a> <a href="differential_graded_algebra" title="wikilink">differential graded algebras</a> over the <a href="rational_number" title="wikilink">rational numbers</a> satisfying certain conditions.</p>

<p>The standard textbook on rational homotopy theory is .</p>

<p>A <strong>rational space</strong> is a <a href="simply_connected_space" title="wikilink">simply connected space</a> all of whose homotopy groups are <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector spaces</a> over the rational numbers. If <em>X</em> is any simply connected <a href="CW_complex" title="wikilink">CW complex</a>, then there is a rational space <em>Y</em>, unique up to <a href="homotopy_equivalence" title="wikilink">homotopy equivalence</a>, and a map from <em>X</em> to <em>Y</em> inducing an <a class="uri" href="isomorphism" title="wikilink">isomorphism</a> on homotopy groups <a href="tensor_product" title="wikilink">tensored</a> with the rational numbers. The space <em>Y</em> is called the <strong>rationalization</strong> of <em>X</em>, and is the <a href="localization_of_a_topological_space" title="wikilink">localization</a> of <em>X</em> at the rationals, and is the <strong>rational homotopy type</strong> of <em>X</em>. Informally, it is obtained from <em>X</em> by killing all torsion in the homotopy groups of <em>X</em>.</p>

<p>A <strong>Sullivan algebra</strong> is a commutative differential graded algebra over the rationals <strong>Q</strong>, whose underlying algebra is the free commutative graded algebra Λ(<em>V</em>) on a graded vector space</p>

<p>satisfying the following "nilpotence condition on <em>d</em> ": <em>V</em> is the union of an increasing series of graded subspaces <em>V</em>(0)⊆<em>V</em>(1)⊆ where <em>d</em> = 0 on <em>V</em>(0) and <em>d</em>(<em>V</em>(<em>k</em>)) is contained in Λ(<em>V</em>(<em>k</em> − 1)). Here "commutative" means commutative in the graded sense, sometimes called <a class="uri" href="supercommutative" title="wikilink">supercommutative</a>. Thus <em>ab</em> = (−1)<sup>deg(<em>a</em>)deg(<em>b</em>)</sup><em>ba</em>.)</p>

<p>The Sullivan algebra is called <strong>minimal</strong> if the image of <em>d</em> is contained in Λ<sup>+</sup>(<em>V</em>)<sup>2</sup>, where Λ<sup>+</sup>(<em>V</em>) is the direct sum of the positive degree subspaces of Λ(<em>V</em>).</p>

<p>A <strong>Sullivan model</strong> for a commutative differential graded algebra <em>A</em> is an <a href="algebra_homomorphism" title="wikilink">algebra homomorphism</a> from a Sullivan algebra Λ(<em>V</em>) that is an isomorphism on <a class="uri" href="cohomology" title="wikilink">cohomology</a>. If <em>A</em><sup>0</sup> = <strong>Q</strong> then <em>A</em> has a minimal Sullivan model which is unique up to isomorphism. (Warning: a minimal Sullivan algebra with the same cohomology as <em>A</em> need not be a minimal Sullivan model for <em>A</em>: it is also necessary that the isomorphism of cohomology be induced by an algebra homomorphism. There are examples of non-isomorphic minimal Sullivan models with the same cohomology algebra.)</p>
<h2 id="the-sullivan-minimal-model-of-a-topological-space">The Sullivan minimal model of a topological space</h2>

<p>For any topological space <em>X</em> Sullivan defined a commutative differential graded algebra <em>A</em><sub><em>PL</em></sub>(<em>X</em>), called the algebra of polynomial differential forms on <em>X</em> with rational coefficients. An element of this algebra consists of (roughly) a polynomial form on each singular simplex of <em>X</em>, compatible with face and degeneracy maps. This algebra is usually very large (uncountable dimension) but can be replaced by a much smaller algebra. More precisely, any differential graded algebra with the same Sullivan minimal model as <em>A</em><sub><em>PL</em></sub>(<em>X</em>) is called a <strong>model</strong> for the space <em>X</em>, and determines the rational homotopy type of <em>X</em> when <em>X</em> is simply connected.</p>

<p>To any simply connected CW complex <em>X</em> with all rational homology groups of finite dimension one can assign a minimal Sullivan algebra Λ<em>V</em> of <em>A</em><sub><em>PL</em></sub>(<em>X</em>), which has the property that <em>V</em><sup>1</sup> = 0 and all the <em>V</em><sup><em>k</em></sup> of finite dimension. This is called the Sullivan minimal model of <em>X</em>, and is unique up to isomorphism. This gives an equivalence between rational homotopy types of such spaces and such algebras, such that:</p>
<ul>
<li>The rational cohomology of the space is the cohomology of its Sullivan minimal model.</li>
<li>The spaces of indecomposables in <em>V</em> are the duals of the rational homotopy groups of the space <em>X</em>.</li>
<li>The <a href="Whitehead_product" title="wikilink">Whitehead product</a> on rational homotopy is the dual of the "quadratic part" of the differential <em>d</em>.</li>
<li>Two spaces have the same rational homotopy type if and only if their minimal Sullivan algebras are isomorphic.</li>
<li>There is a simply connected space <em>X</em> corresponding to each possible Sullivan algebra with <em>V</em><sup>1</sup> = 0 and all the <em>V</em><sup><em>k</em></sup> of finite dimension.</li>
</ul>

<p>When <em>X</em> is a <a href="smooth_manifold" title="wikilink">smooth manifold</a>, the differential algebra of smooth <a href="differential_form" title="wikilink">differential forms</a> on <em>X</em> (the <a href="De_Rham_cohomology" title="wikilink">de Rham complex</a>) is almost a model for <em>X</em>; more precisely it is the tensor product of a model for <em>X</em> with the reals and therefore determines the <strong>real homotopy type</strong>. One can go further and define the <strong>p-adic homotopy type</strong> and the <strong>adelic homotopy type</strong> and compare them to the rational homotopy type.</p>

<p>The results above for simply connected spaces can easily be extended to <a href="nilpotent_space" title="wikilink">nilpotent spaces</a> (whose fundamental group is <a href="nilpotent_group" title="wikilink">nilpotent</a> and acts nilpotently on the higher homotopy groups). For more general fundamental groups things get more complicated; for example, the homotopy groups need not be finitely generated even if there are only a finite number of cells of the CW complex in each dimension.</p>
<h2 id="formal-spaces">Formal spaces</h2>

<p>A commutative differential graded algebra <em>A</em>, again with <em>A</em><sup>0</sup> = <strong>Q</strong>, is called <strong>formal</strong> if <em>A</em> has a model with vanishing differential. This is equivalent to requiring that the cohomology algebra of <em>A</em> (viewed as a differential algebra with trivial differential) is a model for <em>A</em> (though it does not have to be the <em>minimal</em> model). This means that the rational homotopy of a formal space is particularly easy to work out.</p>

<p>Examples of formal spaces include <a href="Hypersphere" title="wikilink">spheres</a>, <a href="H-space" title="wikilink">H-spaces</a>, <a href="symmetric_space" title="wikilink">symmetric spaces</a>, and <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact</a> <a href="Kähler_manifold" title="wikilink">Kähler manifolds</a> . Formality is preserved under <a href="wedge_sum" title="wikilink">wedge sums</a> and <a href="direct_product" title="wikilink">direct products</a>; it is also preserved under <a href="connected_sum" title="wikilink">connected sums</a> for manifolds.</p>

<p>On the other hand, <a href="nilmanifold" title="wikilink">nilmanifolds</a> are almost never formal: if <em>M<sup>n</sup></em> is a compact formal nilmanifold, then <em>M<sup>n</sup>=T<sup>n</sup></em>, the <em>n</em>-dimensional <a class="uri" href="torus" title="wikilink">torus</a> . The simplest example of a non-formal compact nilmanifold is the <strong>Heisenberg manifold</strong>, the quotient of the <a href="Heisenberg_group" title="wikilink">Heisenberg group</a> of 3×3 upper triangular matrices with 1's on the diagonal by its subgroup of matrices with integral coefficients. <a href="Symplectic_manifold" title="wikilink">Symplectic manifolds</a> need not be formal: the simplest example is the Kodaira-Thurston manifold (the product of the Heisenberg manifold with a circle). Examples of non-formal, simply connected symplectic manifolds were given in .</p>

<p>Non-formality may often be detected by <a href="Massey_product" title="wikilink">Massey products</a>. Indeed, if a differential graded algebra <em>A</em> is formal, then all (higher order) Massey products must vanish. The converse is not true: formality means, roughly speaking, the "uniform" vanishing of all Massey products. The complement of the <a href="Borromean_rings" title="wikilink">Borromean rings</a> is a non-formal space: it supports a non-trivial triple Massey product.</p>

<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>If <em>X</em> is a sphere of odd dimension 2<em>n</em> + 1 &gt; 1, its minimal Sullivan model has 1 generator <em>a</em> of degree 2<em>n</em> + 1 with <em>da</em> = 0, and a basis of elements 1, <em>a</em>.</li>
<li>If <em>X</em> is a sphere of even dimension 2<em>n</em> &gt; 0, its minimal Sullivan model has 2 generators <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> of degrees 2<em>n</em> and 4<em>n</em> − 1, with <em>db</em> = <em>a</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>da</em> = 0, and a basis of elements 1, <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>→ <em>a</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>ab</em>→<em>a</em><sup>3</sup>, <em>a</em><sup>2</sup><em>b</em>→<em>a</em><sup>4</sup>, ... where the arrow indicated the action of <em>d</em>.</li>
<li>Suppose that <em>V</em> has 4 elements <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, <em>x</em>, <em>y</em> of degrees 2, 3, 3 and 4 with differentials <em>da</em> = 0, <em>db</em> = 0, <em>dx</em> = <em>a</em><sup>2</sup>, <em>dy</em> = <em>ab</em>. Then this algebra is a minimal Sullivan algebra that is not formal. The cohomology algebra has nontrivial components only in dimension 2,3,6, generated respectively by <em>a</em>, <em>b</em> and <em>xb-ay</em>. Any homomorphism from <em>V</em> to its cohomology algebra would map <em>y</em> to 0, <em>x</em> to a multiple of <em>b</em>, so it would surely map <em>xb-ay</em> to 0. So <em>V</em> cannot be a model for its cohomology algebra. The corresponding topological spaces are two spaces with the same rational <a href="cohomology_ring" title="wikilink">cohomology ring</a> but different rational homotopy types. Notice that <em>xb-ay</em> is in the Massey product
