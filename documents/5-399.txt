   Fibered knot      Fibered knot   (Figure)  Figure-eight knot  is fibered.   In knot theory , a branch of mathematics , a knot or link    K   K   K   in the 3-dimensional sphere     S  3     superscript  S  3    S^{3}   is called fibered or fibred (sometimes Neuwirth knot in older texts, after Lee Neuwirth ) if there is a 1-parameter family    F  t     subscript  F  t    F_{t}   of Seifert surfaces for   K   K   K   , where the parameter   t   t   t   runs through the points of the unit circle     S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   , such that if   s   s   s   is not equal to   t   t   t   then the intersection of    F  s     subscript  F  s    F_{s}   and    F  t     subscript  F  t    F_{t}   is exactly   K   K   K   .  For example:   The unknot , trefoil knot , and figure-eight knot are fibered knots.    The Hopf link is a fibered link.   Fibered knots and links arise naturally, but not exclusively, in complex algebraic geometry . For instance, each singular point of a complex plane curve can be described topologically as the cone on a fibered knot or link called the link of the singularity . The trefoil knot is the link of the cusp singularity      z  2   +   w  3        superscript  z  2    superscript  w  3     z^{2}+w^{3}   ; the Hopf link (oriented correctly) is the link of the node singularity      z  2   +   w  2        superscript  z  2    superscript  w  2     z^{2}+w^{2}   . In these cases, the family of Seifert surfaces is an aspect of the Milnor fibration of the singularity.  A knot is fibered if and only if it is the binding of some open book decomposition of    S  3     superscript  S  3    S^{3}   .  Knots that are not fibered  The Alexander polynomial of a fibered knot is monic, i.e. the coefficients of the highest and lowest powers of t are plus or minus 1. Examples of knots with nonmonic Alexander polynomials abound, for example the twist knots have Alexander polynomials qt − (2 q + 1) + qt −1 , where q is the number of half-twists. 1 In particular the Stevedore's knot is not fibered.
