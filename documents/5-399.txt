Fibered knot

(Figure)
Figure-eight knot is fibered.

In knot theory, a branch of mathematics, a knot or link

 
  in the 3-dimensional sphere

 
  is called fibered or fibred (sometimes Neuwirth knot in older texts, after Lee Neuwirth) if there is a 1-parameter family 
 
 
 
  of Seifert surfaces for 
 
 
 
 , where the parameter 
 
 
 
  runs through the points of the unit circle

 
 , such that if 
 
 
 
  is not equal to 
 
 
 
  then the intersection of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is exactly 
 
 
 
 .
For example:

The unknot, trefoil knot, and figure-eight knot are fibered knots.


The Hopf link is a fibered link.

Fibered knots and links arise naturally, but not exclusively, in complex algebraic geometry. For instance, each singular point of a complex plane curve can be described topologically as the cone on a fibered knot or link called the link of the singularity. The trefoil knot is the link of the cusp singularity

 
 ; the Hopf link (oriented correctly) is the link of the node singularity

 
 . In these cases, the family of Seifert surfaces is an aspect of the Milnor fibration of the singularity.
A knot is fibered if and only if it is the binding of some open book decomposition of 
 
 
 
 .
Knots that are not fibered
 The Alexander polynomial of a fibered knot is monic, i.e. the coefficients of the highest and lowest powers of t are plus or minus 1. Examples of knots with nonmonic Alexander polynomials abound, for example the twist knots have Alexander polynomials qt − (2q + 1) + qt−1, where q is the number of half-twists.1 In particular the Stevedore's knot is not fibered.
