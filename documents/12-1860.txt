Template modeling score
In [[bioinformatics]], the '''template modeling score''' or '''TM-score''' is a measure of similarity between two [[protein structure]]s with different [[tertiary structure]]s. The TM-score is intended as a more accurate measure of the 
 quality of full-length protein structures than the often used RMSD and GDT measures. The TM-score indicates the difference between two structures by a score between 
 
 
 
 , where 1 indicates a perfect match between two structures.1 Generally scores below 0.20 corresponds to randomly chosen unrelated proteins whereas structures with a score higher than 0.5 assume roughly the same fold.2 A quantitative study 3 shows that proteins of TM-score = 0.5 have a posterior probability of 37% in the same CATH topology family and of 13% in the same SCOP fold family. The probabilities increase rapidly when TM-score > 0.5. The TM-score is designed to be independent of protein lengths.
