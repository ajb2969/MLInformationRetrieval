   Template modeling score      Template modeling score  In [[bioinformatics]], the '''template modeling score''' or '''TM-score''' is a measure of similarity between two [[protein structure]]s with different [[tertiary structure]]s. The TM-score is intended as a more accurate measure of the quality of full-length protein structures than the often used RMSD and GDT measures. The TM-score indicates the difference between two structures by a score between    (  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    (0,1]   , where 1 indicates a perfect match between two structures. 1 Generally scores below 0.20 corresponds to randomly chosen unrelated proteins whereas structures with a score higher than 0.5 assume roughly the same fold. 2 A quantitative study 3 shows that proteins of TM-score = 0.5 have a posterior probability of 37% in the same CATH topology family and of 13% in the same SCOP fold family. The probabilities increase rapidly when TM-score > 0.5. The TM-score is designed to be independent of protein lengths.  The equation      TM-score  =   max   [    1   L  target      ∑  i   L  aligned     1   1  +    (    d  i     d  0    (   L  target   )     )   2       ]        TM-score        1   subscript  L  target      superscript   subscript   i    subscript  L  aligned      1    1   superscript     subscript  d  i      subscript  d  0    subscript  L  target     2          \text{TM-score}=\max\left[\frac{1}{L_{\text{target}}}\sum_{i}^{L_{\text{%
 aligned}}}\frac{1}{1+\left(\frac{d_{i}}{d_{0}(L_{\text{target}})}\right)^{2}}\right]     where    L  target     subscript  L  target    L_{\text{target}}   and    L  aligned     subscript  L  aligned    L_{\text{aligned}}   are the lengths of the target protein and the aligned region respectively.    d  i     subscript  d  i    d_{i}   is the distance between the   i   i   i   th pair of residues and        d  0    (   L  target   )    =    1.24     L  target   -  15   3    -  1.8          subscript  d  0    subscript  L  target        1.24     3      subscript  L  target   15     1.8     d_{0}(L_{\text{target}})=1.24\sqrt[3]{L_{\text{target}}-15}-1.8     is a distance scale that normalizes distances.
