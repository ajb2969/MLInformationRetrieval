Tetrahydroxypteridine cycloisomerase

In enzymology, a tetrahydroxypteridine cycloisomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

tetrahydroxypteridine 
 
 
 
  xanthine-8-carboxylate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, tetrahydroxypteridine, and one product, xanthine-8-carboxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is tetrahydroxypteridine lyase (isomerizing). It employs one cofactor, NAD+.
