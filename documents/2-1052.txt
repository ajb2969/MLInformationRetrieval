   Rayleigh law      Rayleigh law   The Rayleigh law describes the behavior of ferromagnetic materials at low fields .  Ferromagnetic materials consist of magnetic domains . When a small external field   H   H   H   is applied, domains parallel to the external field start to grow. In this region, domain walls are moving. They are hindered by material defects. Lord Rayleigh investigated this first 1 and quantified the magnetization   M   M   M   as a linear and quadratic term in the field:       M  =     χ  0   H   +    α  R    μ  0    H  2      .      M       subscript  χ  0   H      subscript  α  R    subscript  μ  0    superscript  H  2       M=\chi_{0}H+\alpha_{R}\mu_{0}H^{2}.     Here    χ  0     subscript  χ  0    \chi_{0}   is the initial susceptibility , describing the reversible part of magnetisation reversal. The Rayleigh constant    α  R     subscript  α  R    \alpha_{R}   describes the irreversible Barkhausen jumps .  The Rayleigh law was derived theoretically by Louis Néel ., 2 3  The same law describes polarization 4 and direct 5 and converse 6  piezoelectric response of some ferroelectric and ferroelectric- ferroelastic materials. The common feature for ferromagnetic, ferroelectric and ferroelastic materials (i.e., ferroic materials) are domains whose boundaries (domain walls) can be moved by magnetic, electric or mechanical fields.
