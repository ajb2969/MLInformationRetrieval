   Electromagnetic electron wave      Electromagnetic electron wave   In plasma physics , an electromagnetic electron wave is a wave in a plasma which has a magnetic field component and in which primarily the electrons oscillate.  In an unmagnetized plasma, an electromagnetic electron wave is simply a light wave modified by the plasma. In a magnetized plasma, there are two modes perpendicular to the field, the O and X modes, and two modes parallel to the field, the R and L waves.  Cut-off frequency and critical density  In an unmagnetized plasma in the high frequency or low density limit, i.e. for    ω  ≫    (    4  π   n  e    e  2    /   m  e    )    1  /  2       much-greater-than  ω   superscript      4  π   subscript  n  e    superscript  e  2     subscript  m  e      1  2      \omega>>(4\pi n_{e}e^{2}/m_{e})^{1/2}   or     n  e   ≪      m  e     ω  2     /  4   π   e  2       much-less-than   subscript  n  e          subscript  m  e    superscript  ω  2    4   π   superscript  e  2      n_{e}<   , the wave speed is the speed of light in vacuum. As the density increases, the phase velocity increases and the group velocity decreases until the cut-off frequency where the light frequency is equal to the plasma frequency. This density is known as the critical density for the angular frequency ω of that wave and is given by 1       n  c   =        ε  o     m  e     e  2      ω  2         subscript  n  c          subscript  ε  o    subscript  m  e     superscript  e  2     superscript  ω  2      n_{c}=\frac{\varepsilon_{o}\,m_{e}}{e^{2}}\,\omega^{2}   .  If the critical density is exceeded, the plasma is called over-dense .  In a magnetized plasma, except for the O wave, the cut-off relationships are more complex.  O wave  The O wave is the "ordinary" wave in the sense that its dispersion relation is the same as that in an unmagnetized plasma. It is plane polarized with E 1 || B 0 . It has a cut-off at the plasma frequency .  X wave  The X wave is the "extraordinary" wave because it has a more complicated dispersion relation. It is partly transverse (with E 1 ⊥ B 0 ) and partly longitudinal. As the density is increased, the phase velocity rises from c until the cut-off at ω R is reached. As the density is further increased, the wave is evanescent until the resonance at the upper hybrid frequency ω h . Then it can propagate again until the second cut-off at ω L . The cut-off frequencies are given by 2       ω  R   =    1  2    [    ω  c   +    (    ω  c  2   +   4   ω  p  2     )    1  /  2     ]         subscript  ω  R       1  2    delimited-[]     subscript  ω  c    superscript     superscript   subscript  ω  c   2     4   superscript   subscript  ω  p   2       1  2         \omega_{R}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\omega_{c}+(\omega_{c}^{2}+4\omega_{p}^{2})^{1/2}\right]          ω  L   =    1  2    [    -   ω  c    +    (    ω  c  2   +   4   ω  p  2     )    1  /  2     ]         subscript  ω  L       1  2    delimited-[]       subscript  ω  c     superscript     superscript   subscript  ω  c   2     4   superscript   subscript  ω  p   2       1  2         \omega_{L}=\frac{1}{2}\left[-\omega_{c}+(\omega_{c}^{2}+4\omega_{p}^{2})^{1/2}\right]   where    ω  c     subscript  ω  c    \omega_{c}   is the electron cyclotron resonance frequency, and    ω  p     subscript  ω  p    \omega_{p}   is the electron plasma frequency .  R wave and L wave  The R wave and the L wave are right-hand and left-hand circularly polarized, respectively. The R wave has a cut-off at ω R (hence the designation of this frequency) and a resonance at ω c . The L wave has a cut-off at ω L and no resonance. R waves at frequencies below ω c /2 are also known as whistler modes . 3  Dispersion relations  The dispersion relation can be written as an expression for the frequency (squared), but it is also common to write it as an expression for the index of refraction  ck /ω (squared).
