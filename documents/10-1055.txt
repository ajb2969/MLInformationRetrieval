   Deacetoxycephalosporin-C hydroxylase      Deacetoxycephalosporin-C hydroxylase   In enzymology , a deacetoxycephalosporin-C hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   deacetoxycephalosporin C + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   deacetylcephalosporin C + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are deacetoxycephalosporin C , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are deacetylcephalosporin C , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deacetoxycephalosporin-C,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include deacetylcephalosporin C synthase , 3'-methylcephem hydroxylase , DACS , DAOC hydroxylase , and deacetoxycephalosporin C hydroxylase . This enzyme participates in penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis .  References           "  Category:EC 1.14.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
