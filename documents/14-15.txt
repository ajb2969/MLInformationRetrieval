   Torsionless module      Torsionless module   In abstract algebra , a module  M over a ring  R is called torsionless if it can be embedded into some direct product  R I . Equivalently, M is torsionless if each non-zero element of M has non-zero image under some R -linear functional f :       f  ∈   M  ∗   =    Hom  R    (  M  ,  R  )     ,    f   (  m  )    ≠  0.      formulae-sequence      f   superscript  M  normal-∗          subscript  Hom  R   M  R         f  m   0.     f\in M^{\ast}=\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M,R),\quad f(m)\neq 0.     This notion was introduced by Hyman Bass .  Properties and examples  A module is torsionless if and only if the canonical map into its double dual,      M  →   M    ∗  ∗    =   Hom  R    (   M  ∗   ,  R  )   ,  m  ↦   (  f  ↦  f   (  m  )   )   ,  m  ∈  M  ,  f  ∈   M  ∗   ,     fragments  M  normal-→   superscript  M   normal-∗  absent  normal-∗      subscript  Hom  R    fragments  normal-(   superscript  M  normal-∗   normal-,  R  normal-)   normal-,  m  maps-to   fragments  normal-(  f  maps-to  f   fragments  normal-(  m  normal-)   normal-)   normal-,  m   M  normal-,  f    superscript  M  normal-∗   normal-,    M\to M^{\ast\ast}=\operatorname{Hom}_{R}(M^{\ast},R),\quad m\mapsto(f\mapsto f%
 (m)),m\in M,f\in M^{\ast},     is injective . If this map is bijective then the module is called reflexive . For this reason, torsionless modules are also known as semi-reflexive .   A free module is torsionless. More generally, a direct sum of torsionless modules is torsionless.  A free module is reflexive if it is finitely generated , but for some rings there are also infinitely generated free modules that are reflexive. For instance, the direct sum of countably many copies of the integers is a reflexive module over the integers, see for instance. P. C. Eklof and A. H. Mekler,   Almost free modules, North-Holland Mathematical Library vol. 46, North-Holland, Amsterdam 1990   A submodule of a torsionless module is torsionless. In particular, any projective module over R is torsionless; any left ideal of R is a torsionless left module, and similarly for the right ideals.  Any torsionless module over a domain is a torsion-free module , but the converse is not true, as Q is a torsion-free Z -module which is not torsionless.  If R is a commutative ring which is an integral domain and M is a finitely generated torsion-free module then M can be embedded into R n and hence M is torsionless.  Suppose that N is a right R -module, then its dual N * has a structure of a left R -module. It turns out that any left R -module arising in this way is torsionless (similarly, any right R -module that is a dual of a left R -module is torsionless).  Over a Dedekind domain, a finitely generated module is reflexive if and only if it is torsion-free. 1    Let R be a Noetherian ring and M a reflexive finitely generated module over R . Then    M   ⊗  R   S      subscript  tensor-product  R   M  S    M\otimes_{R}S   is a reflexive module over S whenever S is flat over R . 2   Relation with semihereditary rings  Stephen Chase proved the following characterization of semihereditary rings in connection with torsionless modules:  For any ring R , the following conditions are equivalent:   R is left semihereditary.  All torsionless right R -modules are flat .  The ring R is left coherent and satisfies any of the four conditions that are known to be equivalent:  All right ideals of R are flat.  All left ideals of R are flat.  Submodules of all right flat R -modules are flat.  Submodules of all left flat R -modules are flat.    (The mixture of left/right adjectives in the statement is not a mistake.)

Conversely, over a Dedekind domain, a finitely generated torsion-free module is projective and a projective module is reflexive (the existence of a dual basis ). ↩  ↩
