   Gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase      Gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a gamma-guanidinobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-guanidinobutanal + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-guanidinobutanoate + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 4-guanidinobutanal , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 4-guanidinobutanoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-guanidinobutanal:NAD+ 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include alpha-guanidinobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase , 4-guanidinobutyraldehyde dehydrogenase , and GBAL dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups .  References     "  Category:EC 1.2.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
