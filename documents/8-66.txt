   Satisfiability modulo theories      Satisfiability modulo theories   In computer science and mathematical logic , the satisfiability modulo theories ( SMT ) problem is a decision problem for logical formulas with respect to combinations of background theories expressed in classical first-order logic with equality. Examples of theories typically used in computer science are the theory of real numbers , the theory of integers , and the theories of various data structures such as lists , arrays , bit vectors and so on. SMT can be thought of as a form of the constraint satisfaction problem and thus a certain formalized approach to constraint programming .  Basic terminology  Formally speaking, an SMT instance is a formula in first-order logic , where some function and predicate symbols have additional interpretations, and SMT is the problem of determining whether such a formula is satisfiable. In other words, imagine an instance of the Boolean satisfiability problem (SAT) in which some of the binary variables are replaced by predicates over a suitable set of non-binary variables. A predicate is basically a binary-valued function of non-binary variables. Example predicates include linear inequalities (e.g.,       3  x   +   2  y    -  z   ‚â•  4            3  x     2  y    z   4    3x+2y-z\geq 4   ) or equalities involving uninterpreted terms and function symbols (e.g.,     f   (   f   (  u  ,  v  )    ,  v  )    =   f   (  u  ,  v  )          f     f   u  v    v      f   u  v      f(f(u,v),v)=f(u,v)   where   f   f   f   is some unspecified function of two unspecified arguments.) These predicates are classified according to each respective theory assigned. For instance, linear inequalities over real variables are evaluated using the rules of the theory of linear real arithmetic , whereas predicates involving uninterpreted terms and function symbols are evaluated using the rules of the theory of uninterpreted functions with equality (sometimes referred to as the empty theory ). Other theories include the theories of arrays and list structures (useful for modeling and verifying software programs ), and the theory of bit vectors (useful in modeling and verifying hardware designs ). Subtheories are also possible: for example, difference logic is a sub-theory of linear arithmetic in which each inequality is restricted to have the form     x  -  y   >  c        x  y   c    x-y>c   for variables   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   and constant   c   c   c   .  Most SMT solvers support only quantifier free fragments of their logics.  Expressive power of SMT  An SMT instance is a generalization of a Boolean SAT instance in which various sets of variables are replaced by predicates from a variety of underlying theories. Obviously, SMT formulas provide a much richer modeling language than is possible with Boolean SAT formulas. For example, an SMT formula allows us to model the datapath operations of a microprocessor at the word rather than the bit level.  By comparison, answer set programming is also based on predicates (more precisely, on atomic sentences created from atomic formula ). Unlike SMT, answer-set programs do not have quantifiers, and cannot easily express constraints such as linear arithmetic or difference logic ‚ÄîASP is at best suitable for boolean problems that reduce to the free theory of uninterpreted functions. Implementing 32-bit integers as bitvectors in ASP suffers from most of the same problems that early SMT solvers faced: "obvious" identities such as x + y = y + x are difficult to deduce.  Constraint logic programming does provide support for linear arithmetic constraints, but within a completely different theoretical framework.  SMT solver approaches  Early attempts for solving SMT instances involved translating them to Boolean SAT instances (e.g., a 32-bit integer variable would be encoded by 32 bit variables with appropriate weights and word-level operations such as 'plus' would be replaced by lower-level logic operations on the bits) and passing this formula to a Boolean SAT solver. This approach, which is referred to as the eager approach , has its merits: by pre-processing the SMT formula into an equivalent Boolean SAT formula we can use existing Boolean SAT solvers "as-is" and leverage their performance and capacity improvements over time. On the other hand, the loss of the high-level semantics of the underlying theories means that the Boolean SAT solver has to work a lot harder than necessary to discover "obvious" facts (such as     x  +  y   =   y  +  x         x  y     y  x     x+y=y+x   for integer addition.) This observation led to the development of a number of SMT solvers that tightly integrate the Boolean reasoning of a DPLL -style search with theory-specific solvers ( T-solvers ) that handle conjunctions (ANDs) of predicates from a given theory. This approach is referred to as the lazy approach .  Dubbed DPLL(T), 1 this architecture gives the responsibility of Boolean reasoning to the DPLL-based SAT solver which, in turn, interacts with a solver for theory T through a well-defined interface. The theory solver need only worry about checking the feasibility of conjunctions of theory predicates passed on to it from the SAT solver as it explores the Boolean search space of the formula. For this integration to work well, however, the theory solver must be able to participate in propagation and conflict analysis, i.e., it must be able to infer new facts from already established facts, as well as to supply succinct explanations of infeasibility when theory conflicts arise. In other words, the theory solver must be incremental and backtrackable .  SMT for undecidable theories  Most of the common SMT approaches support decidable theories. However, many real-world systems can only be modelled by means of non-linear arithmetic over the real numbers involving transcendental functions , e.g. an aircraft and its behavior. This fact motivates an extension of the SMT problem to non-linear theories, e.g. determine whether           (  sin    (  x  )   3   =  cos   (  log   (  y  )   ‚ãÖ  x  )   ‚à®  b  ‚à®  -   x  2   ‚â•  2.3  y  )   ‚àß   (  ¬¨  b  ‚à®  y  <  -  34.4  ‚à®  exp   (  x  )   >   y  x   )           missing-subexpression    fragments   fragments  normal-(    superscript   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   3      fragments  normal-(    fragments  normal-(  y  normal-)   normal-‚ãÖ  x  normal-)    b     superscript  x  2    2.3  y  normal-)     fragments  normal-(   b   y    34.4     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)      y  x   normal-)       \begin{array}[]{lr}&(\sin(x)^{3}=\cos(\log(y)\cdot x)\vee b\vee-x^{2}\geq 2.3y%
 )\wedge\left(\neg b\vee y<-34.4\vee\exp(x)>{y\over x}\right)\end{array}     where       b  ‚àà   ùîπ  ,  x    ,   y  ‚àà  ‚Ñù      formulae-sequence    b   ùîπ  x      y  ‚Ñù     b\in{\mathbb{B}},x,y\in{\mathbb{R}}     is satisfiable. Then, such problems become undecidable in general. (It is important to note, however, that the theory of real closed fields , and thus the full first order theory of the real numbers , are decidable using quantifier elimination . This is due to Alfred Tarski .) The first order theory of the natural numbers with addition (but not multiplication), called Presburger arithmetic , is also decidable. Since multiplication by constants can be implemented as nested additions, the arithmetic in many computer programs can be expressed using Presburger arithmetic, resulting in decidable formulas.  Examples of SMT solvers addressing Boolean combinations of theory atoms from undecidable arithmetic theories over the reals are ABsolver, 2 which employs a classical DPLL(T) architecture with a non-linear optimization packet as (necessarily incomplete) subordinate theory solver, and iSAT 1 , building on a unification of DPLL SAT-solving and interval constraint propagation called the iSAT algorithm. 3  SMT solvers  The table below summarizes some of the features of the many available SMT solvers. The column "SMT-LIB" indicates compatibility with the SMT-LIB language; many systems marked 'yes' may support only older versions of SMT-LIB, or offer only partial support for the language. The column "CVC" indicates support for the CVC language. The column "DIMACS" indicates support for the DIMACS format.  Projects differ not only in features and performance, but also in the viability of the surrounding community, its ongoing interest in a project, and its ability to contribute documentation, fixes, tests and enhancements.

Verification  Computer-aided verification of software programs often uses SMT solvers. A common technique is to translate preconditions, postconditions, loop conditions, and assertions into SMT formulas in order to determine if all properties can hold.  There are many verifiers built on top of the Z3 SMT solver. Boogie is an intermediate verification language that uses Z3 to automatically check simple imperative programs. The 3 verifier for concurrent C uses Boogie, as well as Dafny for imperative object-based programs, Chalice for concurrent programs, and Spec# for C#. F* is a dependently typed language that uses Z3 to find proofs; the compiler carries these proofs through to produce proof-carrying bytecode.  There are also many verifiers built on top of the Alt-Ergo SMT solver. Here is a list of mature applications:   Why3 , a platform for deductive program verification, uses Alt-Ergo as its main prover;  CAVEAT, a C-verifier developed by CEA and used by Airbus; Alt-Ergo was included in the qualification DO-178C of one of its recent aircraft;  Frama-C , a framework to analyse C-code, uses Alt-Ergo in the Jessie and WP plugins (dedicated to "deductive program verification");  SPARK , uses CVC4 and Alt-Ergo (behind GNATprove) to automate the verification of some assertions in SPARK 2014;  Atelier-B can use Alt-Ergo instead of its main prover (increasing success from 84% to 98% on the ANR Bware project benchmarks );  Rodin , a B-method framework developed by Systerel, can use Alt-Ergo as a back-end;  Cubicle , an open source model checker for verifying safety properties of array-based transition systems.  EasyCrypt , a toolset for reasoning about relational properties of probabilistic computations with adversarial code.   Many SMT solvers implement a common interface format called SMTLIB2 (such files usually have the extension " .smt2 "). The LiquidHaskell tool implements a refinement type based verifier for Haskell that can use any SMTLIB2 compliant solver, e.g. CVC4, MathSat, or Z3.  Symbolic-execution based analysis and testing  An important application of SMT solvers is symbolic execution for analysis and testing of programs (e.g., concolic testing ), aimed particularly at finding security vulnerabilities. Important actively-maintained tools in this category include SAGE from Microsoft Research , KLEE , and S2E . SMT solvers that are particularly useful for symbolic-execution applications include Z3 , STP , Z3str2 , and Boolector .  See also   Answer set programming   Notes    References   Vijay Ganesh (PhD.
