   Continuous Hahn polynomials      Continuous Hahn polynomials   In mathematics, the continuous Hahn polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials in the Askey scheme of hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials. They are defined in terms of generalized hypergeometric functions by        p  n    (  x  ;  a  ,  b  ,  c  ,  d  )    =    i  n       (   a  +  c   )   n     (   a  +  d   )   n     n  !

Closely related polynomials include the dual Hahn polynomials  R n ( x ;γ,δ, N ), the Hahn polynomials , and the continuous dual Hahn polynomials  S n ( x ; a , b , c ). These polynomials all have q -analogs with an extra parameter q , such as the q-Hahn polynomials  Q n ( x ;α,β, N ; q ), and so on.
