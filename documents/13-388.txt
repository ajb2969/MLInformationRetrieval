Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund inequality

In mathematics, the Marcinkiewicz–Zygmund inequality, named after Józef Marcinkiewicz and Antoni Zygmund, gives relations between moments of a collection of independent random variables. It is a generalization of the rule for the sum of variances of independent random variables to moments of arbitrary order.

The second-order case
In the case

$$\mathrm{Var}\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\right)=E\left(  \left\vert \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\right\vert ^{2}\right)  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j=1}^{n}E\left( x_{i}\overline{x}_{j}\right)  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}E\left(  \left\vert x_{i}\right\vert ^{2}\right)  =\sum_{i=1}^{n}\mathrm{Var}\left(x_{i}\right).$$

Several similar moment inequalities are known as Khintchine inequality and Rosenthal inequalities, and there are also extensions to more general symmetric statistics of independent random variables.1
