Loop entropy

Loop entropy is the entropy lost upon bringing together two residues of a polymer within a prescribed distance. For a single loop, the entropy varies logarithmically with the number of residues 
 
 
 
  in the loop



where 
 
 
 
  is Boltzmann's constant and 
 
 
 
  is a coefficient that depends on the properties of the polymer. This entropy formula corresponds to a power-law distribution 
 
 
 
  for the probability of the residues contacting.
The loop entropy may also vary with the position of the contacting residues. Residues near the ends of the polymer are more likely to contact (quantitatively, have a lower 
 
 
 
 ) than those in the middle (i.e., far from the ends), primarily due to excluded volume effects.
Wang-Uhlenbeck entropy
The loop entropy formula becomes more complicated with multiples loops, but may be determined for a Gaussian polymer using a matrix method developed by Wang and Uhlenbeck. Let there be 
 
 
 
  contacts among the residues, which define 
 
 
 
  loops of the polymers. The Wang-Uhlenbeck matrix 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
  symmetric, real matrix whose elements 
 
 
 
  equal the number of common residues between loops 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The entropy of making the specified contacts equals



As an example, consider the entropy lost upon making the contacts between residues 26 and 84 and residues 58 and 110 in a polymer (cf. ribonuclease A). The first and second loops have lengths 58 (=84-26) and 52 (=110-58), respectively, and they have 26 (=84-58) residues in common. The corresponding Wang-Uhlenbeck matrix is


 
  whose determinant is 2340. Taking the logarithm and multiplying by the constants 
 
 
 
  gives the entropy.
