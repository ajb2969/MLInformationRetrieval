   Fibonacci retracement      Fibonacci retracement   (Figure)  Fibonacci retracement levels shown on the USD/CAD currency pair . In this case, price retraced approximately 38.2% of a move down before continuing.   In finance , Fibonacci retracement is a method of technical analysis for determining support and resistance levels. They are named after their use of the Fibonacci sequence . Fibonacci retracement is based on the idea that markets will retrace a predictable portion of a move, after which they will continue to move in the original direction.  The appearance of retracement can be ascribed to ordinary price volatility as described by Burton Malkiel , a Princeton  economist in his book A Random Walk Down Wall Street , who found no reliable predictions in technical analysis methods taken as a whole. Malkiel argues that asset prices typically exhibit signs of random walk and that one cannot consistently outperform market averages . Fibonacci retracement is created by taking two extreme points on a chart and dividing the vertical distance by the key Fibonacci ratios. 0.0% is considered to be the start of the retracement, while 100.0% is a complete reversal to the original part of the move. Once these levels are identified, horizontal lines are drawn and used to identify possible support and resistance levels.  Fibonacci ratios  Fibonacci ratios are mathematical relationships, expressed as ratios, derived from the Fibonacci sequence . The key Fibonacci ratios are 0%, 23.6%, 38.2%, 61.8%, and 100%.       F   100  %    =    (    1  +   5    2   )   0   =   1          subscript  F   percent  100     superscript      1    5    2   0        1     F_{100\%}=\left(\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}\right)^{0}=1\,     The key Fibonacci ratio of 0.618 is derived by dividing any number in the sequence by the number that immediately follows it. For example: 8/13 is approximately 0.6154, and 55/89 is approximately 0.6180.       F   61.8  %    =    (    1  +   5    2   )    -  1    ≈   0.618034          subscript  F   percent  61.8     superscript      1    5    2     1         0.618034     F_{61.8\%}=\left({\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}\right)^{-1}\approx 0.618034\,     The 0.382 ratio is found by dividing any number in the sequence by the number that is found two places to the right. For example: 34/89 is approximately 0.3820.       F   38.2  %    =    (    1  +   5    2   )    -  2    ≈   0.381966          subscript  F   percent  38.2     superscript      1    5    2     2         0.381966     F_{38.2\%}=\left({\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}\right)^{-2}\approx 0.381966\,     The 0.236 ratio is found by dividing any number in the sequence by the number that is three places to the right. For example: 55/233 is approximately 0.2361.       F   23.6  %    =    (    1  +   5    2   )    -  3    ≈   0.236068          subscript  F   percent  23.6     superscript      1    5    2     3         0.236068     F_{23.6\%}=\left({\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}\right)^{-3}\approx 0.236068\,     The 0 ratio is :       F   0  %    =    (    1  +   5    2   )    -  ∞    =   0          subscript  F   percent  0     superscript      1    5    2             0     F_{0\%}=\left({\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}\right)^{-\infty}=0\,     Other ratios  The 0.764 ratio is the result of subtracting 0.236 from the number 1.       F   76.4  %    =   1  -    (    1  +   5    2   )    -  3     ≈   0.763932          subscript  F   percent  76.4      1   superscript      1    5    2     3          0.763932     F_{76.4\%}=1-\left({\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}\right)^{-3}\approx 0.763932\,     The 0.786 ratio is :       F   78.6  %    =    (    1  +   5    2   )    -   1  2     ≈   0.786151          subscript  F   percent  78.6     superscript      1    5    2       1  2          0.786151     F_{78.6\%}=\left({\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}}\right)^{-\frac{1}{2}}\approx 0.786151\,     The 0.500 ratio is derived from dividing the number 1 (second number in the sequence ) by the number 2 (third number in the sequence ).       F   50  %    =   1  2   =   0.500000          subscript  F   percent  50      1  2        0.500000     F_{50\%}=\frac{1}{2}=0.500000\,     Academic studies  References         External links   What is Fibonacci retracement, and where do the ratios that are used come from? at investopedia.com  Fibonacci Retracements at stockcharts.com  Number Sequence Fibonacci Retracement at tradersdaytrading.com   "  Category:Chart overlays  Category:Fibonacci numbers
