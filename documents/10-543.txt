   Hydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate dehydrogenase      Hydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a hydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (1S,3R,4S)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexane-1-carboxylate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (1S,4S)-4-hydroxy-3-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (1S,3R,4S)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexane-1-carboxylate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are (1S,4S)-4-hydroxy-3-oxocyclohexane-1-carboxylate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (1S,3R,4S)-3,4-dihydroxycyclohexane-1-carboxylate:NAD + 3-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include dihydroxycyclohexanecarboxylate dehydrogenase , and (−)t-3,t-4-dihydroxycyclohexane-c-1-carboxylate-NAD + oxidoreductase .
