The Pareto distribution, named after the Italian civil engineer, economist, and sociologist Vilfredo Pareto, is a power law probability distribution that is used in description of social, scientific, geophysical, actuarial, and many other types of observable phenomena.
Definition
If X is a random variable with a Pareto (Type I) distribution,1 then the probability that X is greater than some number x, i.e. the survival function (also called tail function), is given by



where xm is the (necessarily positive) minimum possible value of X, and α is a positive parameter. The Pareto Type I distribution is characterized by a scale parameter xm and a shape parameter α, which is known as the tail index. When this distribution is used to model the distribution of wealth, then the parameter α is called the Pareto index.
Properties
Cumulative distribution function
From the definition, the cumulative distribution function of a Pareto random variable with parameters α and xm is



When plotted on linear axes, the distribution assumes the familiar J-shaped curve which approaches each of the orthogonal axes asymptotically. All segments of the curve are self-similar (subject to appropriate scaling factors). When plotted in a log-log plot, the distribution is represented by a straight line.
Probability density function
It follows (by differentiation) that the probability density function is



Moments and characteristic function

The expected value of a random variable following a Pareto distribution is


:

\frac{\alpha x_\mathrm{m}}{\alpha-1} & \alpha>1. \end{cases}

The variance of a random variable following a Pareto distribution is







\infty & \alpha\in(1,2], \\ \left(\frac{x_\mathrm{m}}{\alpha-1}\right)^2 \frac{\alpha}{\alpha-2} & \alpha>2. \end{cases}

(If α ≤ 1, the variance does not exist.)
 


The raw moments are










The moment generating function is only defined for non-positive values t ≤ 0 as













The characteristic function is given by










where Γ(a, x) is the incomplete gamma function.
 

Conditional distributions
The conditional probability distribution of a Pareto-distributed random variable, given the event that it is greater than or equal to a particular number 
 
 
 
  exceeding 
 
 
 
 , is a Pareto distribution with the same Pareto index 
 
 
 
  but with minimum 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
 .
A characterization theorem
Suppose 
 
 
 
  are independent identically distributed random variables whose probability distribution is supported on the interval 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 . Suppose that for all 
 
 
 
 , the two random variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent. Then the common distribution is a Pareto distribution.

Generalized Pareto distributions
There is a hierarchy 45 of Pareto distributions known as Pareto Type I, II, III, IV, and Feller–Pareto distributions.678 Pareto Type IV contains Pareto Type I–III as special cases. The Feller–Pareto910 distribution generalizes Pareto Type IV.
Pareto types I–IV
The Pareto distribution hierarchy is summarized in the next table comparing the survival functions (complementary CDF).
When μ = 0, the Pareto distribution Type II is also known as the Lomax distribution.11
In this section, the symbol xm, used before to indicate the minimum value of x, is replaced by σ.

The finiteness of the mean, and the existence and the finiteness of the variance depend on the tail index α (inequality index γ). In particular, fractional δ-moments are finite for some δ > 0, as shown in the table below, where δ is not necessarily an integer.

Feller–Pareto distribution
Feller1213 defines a Pareto variable by transformation U = Y−1 − 1 of a beta random variable Y, whose probability density function is



where B( ) is the beta function. If



then W has a Feller–Pareto distribution FP(μ, σ, γ, γ1, γ2).14
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent Gamma variables, another construction of a Feller–Pareto (FP) variable is15

Applications
Pareto originally used this distribution to describe the allocation of wealth among individuals since it seemed to show rather well the way that a larger portion of the wealth of any society is owned by a smaller percentage of the people in that society. He also used it to describe distribution of income.16 This idea is sometimes expressed more simply as the Pareto principle or the "80-20 rule" which says that 20% of the population controls 80% of the wealth.17 However, the 80-20 rule corresponds to a particular value of α, and in fact, Pareto's data on British income taxes in his Cours d'économie politique indicates that about 30% of the population had about 70% of the income. The probability density function (PDF) graph at the beginning of this article shows that the "probability" or fraction of the population that owns a small amount of wealth per person is rather high, and then decreases steadily as wealth increases. (Note that the Pareto distribution is not realistic for wealth for the lower end. In fact, net worth may even be negative.) This distribution is not limited to describing wealth or income, but to many situations in which an equilibrium is found in the distribution of the "small" to the "large". The following examples are sometimes seen as approximately Pareto-distributed:

The sizes of human settlements (few cities, many hamlets/villages)18
File size distribution of Internet traffic which uses the TCP protocol (many smaller files, few larger ones)19
Hard disk drive error rates20
Clusters of Bose–Einstein condensate near absolute zero21
The values of oil reserves in oil fields (a few large fields, many small fields)22
The length distribution in jobs assigned supercomputers (a few large ones, many small ones)
The standardized price returns on individual stocks 23

In hydrology the Pareto distribution is applied to extreme events such as annually maximum one-day rainfalls and river discharges. The blue picture illustrates an example of fitting the Pareto distribution to ranked annually maximum one-day rainfalls showing also the 90% confidence belt based on the binomial distribution. The rainfall data are represented by plotting positions as part of the cumulative frequency analysis.

Relation to other distributions
Relation to the exponential distribution
The Pareto distribution is related to the exponential distribution as follows. If X is Pareto-distributed with minimum xm and index α, then



is exponentially distributed with rate parameter α. Equivalently, if Y is exponentially distributed with rate α, then



is Pareto-distributed with minimum xm and index α.
This can be shown using the standard change of variable techniques:


 
  and shape 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to the generalized Pareto distribution with location 
 
 
 
 , scale 
 
 
 
  and shape 
 
 
 
 . Vice versa one can get the Pareto distribution from the GPD by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Relation to Zipf's law
Pareto distributions are continuous probability distributions. Zipf's law, also sometimes called the zeta distribution, may be thought of as a discrete counterpart of the Pareto distribution.
Relation to the "Pareto principle"
The "80-20 law", according to which 20% of all people receive 80% of all income, and 20% of the most affluent 20% receive 80% of that 80%, and so on, holds precisely when the Pareto index is α = log4(5) = log(5)/log(4), approximately 1.161. This result can be derived from the Lorenz curve formula given below. Moreover, the following have been shown27 to be mathematically equivalent:

Income is distributed according to a Pareto distribution with index α > 1.
There is some number 0 ≤ p ≤ 1/2 such that 100p % of all people receive 100(1 − p) % of all income, and similarly for every real (not necessarily integer) n > 0, 100pn % of all people receive 100(1 − p)n percentage of all income.

This does not apply only to income, but also to wealth, or to anything else that can be modeled by this distribution.
This excludes Pareto distributions in which 0 L(F)=\frac{\int_{x_\mathrm{m}}^{x(F)}xf(x)\,dx}{\int_{x_\mathrm{m}}^\infty xf(x)\,dx} =\frac{\int_0^F x(F')\,dF'}{\int_0^1 x(F')\,dF'}
where x(F) is the inverse of the CDF. For the Pareto distribution,



and the Lorenz curve is calculated to be



Although the numerator and denominator in the expression for 
 
 
 
  diverge for 
 
 
 
 , their ratio does not, yielding L=0 in these cases, which yields a Gini coefficient of unity. Examples of the Lorenz curve for a number of Pareto distributions are shown in the graph on the right.
The Gini coefficient is a measure of the deviation of the Lorenz curve from the equidistribution line which is a line connecting [0, 0] and [1, 1], which is shown in black (α = ∞) in the Lorenz plot on the right. Specifically, the Gini coefficient is twice the area between the Lorenz curve and the equidistribution line. The Gini coefficient for the Pareto distribution is then calculated (for 
 
 
 
 ) to be



(see Aaberge 2005).
Parameter estimation
The likelihood function for the Pareto distribution parameters α and xm, given a sample x = (x1, x2, ..., xn), is



Therefore, the logarithmic likelihood function is



It can be seen that 
 
 
 
  is monotonically increasing with xm, that is, the greater the value of xm, the greater the value of the likelihood function. Hence, since x ≥ xm, we conclude that



To find the estimator for α, we compute the corresponding partial derivative and determine where it is zero:



Thus the maximum likelihood estimator for α is:



The expected statistical error is:28



Malik (1970)29 gives the exact joint distribution of 
 
 
 
 . In particular, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent and 
 
 
 
  is Pareto with scale parameter xm and shape parameter nα, whereas 
 
 
 
  has an Inverse-gamma distribution with shape and scale parameters n−1 and nα, respectively.
Graphical representation
The characteristic curved 'Long Tail' distribution when plotted on a linear scale, masks the underlying simplicity of the function when plotted on a log-log graph, which then takes the form of a straight line with negative gradient: It follows from the formula for the probability density function that for x ≥ xm,



Since α is positive, the gradient −(α+1) is negative.
Random sample generation
Random samples can be generated using inverse transform sampling. Given a random variate U drawn from the uniform distribution on the unit interval (0, 1], the variate T given by



is Pareto-distributed.30 If U is uniformly distributed on [0, 1), it can be exchanged with (1 − U).

The bounded (or truncated) Pareto distribution has three parameters α, L and H. As in the standard Pareto distribution α determines the shape. L denotes the minimal value, and H denotes the maximal value. (The variance in the table on the right should be interpreted as the second moment).
The probability density function is



where L ≤ x ≤ H, and α > 0.
Generating bounded Pareto random variables
If U is uniformly distributed on (0, 1), then applying inverse-transform method 31



$$x = \left(-\frac{U H^\alpha - U L^\alpha - H^\alpha}{H^\alpha L^\alpha}\right)^{-\frac{1}{\alpha}}$$
is a bounded Pareto-distributed.  {{-}}
Symmetric Pareto distribution
The symmetric Pareto distribution can be defined by the probability density function:32
$$f(x;\alpha,x_\mathrm{m}) = \begin{cases}
 \tfrac{1}{2}\alpha x_\mathrm{m}^\alpha |x|^{-\alpha-1} & |x|>x_\mathrm{m} \\
 0 & \text{otherwise}.
 \end{cases}$$
It has a similar shape to a Pareto distribution for x > xm and is mirror symmetric about the vertical axis.
