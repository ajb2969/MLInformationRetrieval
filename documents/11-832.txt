3-oxoadipyl-CoA thiolase

In enzymology, a 3-oxoadipyl-CoA thiolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

succinyl-CoA + acetyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  CoA + 3-oxoadipyl-CoA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and acetyl-CoA, whereas its two products are CoA and 3-oxoadipyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:acetyl-CoA C-succinyltransferase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation.
3-Oxoadipyl-CoA thiolase belongs to the thiolase family of enzymes.
