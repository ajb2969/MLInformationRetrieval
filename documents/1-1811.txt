   Finitely generated abelian group      Finitely generated abelian group   In abstract algebra , an abelian group is called finitely generated if there exist finitely many elements x 1 , ..., x s in G such that every x in G can be written in the form   x = n 1 x 1 + n 2 x 2 + ... + n s x s    with integers  n 1 , ..., n s . In this case, we say that the set  is a generating set of G or that x 1 , ..., x s  generate  G .  Clearly, every finite abelian group is finitely generated. The finitely generated abelian groups are of a rather simple structure and can be completely classified, as will be explained below.  Examples   The integers     (  ℤ  ,  +  )     ℤ     \left(\mathbb{Z},+\right)   are a finitely generated abelian group.  The integers modulo   n   n   n    ,    (   ℤ  n   ,  +  )      subscript  ℤ  n      \left(\mathbb{Z}_{n},+\right)   are a finitely generated abelian group.  Any direct sum of finitely many finitely generated abelian groups is again a finitely generated abelian group.  Every lattice forms a finitely generated free abelian group .   There are no other examples (up to isomorphism). In particular, the group    (  ℚ  ,  +  )     ℚ     \left(\mathbb{Q},+\right)   of rational numbers is not finitely generated: 1 if     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}   are rational numbers, pick a natural number    k   k   k    coprime to all the denominators; then    1  /  k      1  k    1/k   cannot be generated by     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}   . The group    (   ℚ  *   ,  ⋅  )      superscript  ℚ    normal-⋅    \left(\mathbb{Q}^{*},\cdot\right)   of non-zero rational numbers is also not finitely generated. The groups of real numbers under addition  and real numbers under multiplication  are also not finitely generated. 2 3  Classification  The fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups (which is a special case of the structure theorem for finitely generated modules over a principal ideal domain ) can be stated two ways (analogously with principal ideal domains ):  Primary decomposition  The primary decomposition formulation states that every finitely generated abelian group G is isomorphic to a direct sum of primary cyclic groups and infinite cyclic groups . A primary cyclic group is one whose order is a power of a prime . That is, every finitely generated abelian group is isomorphic to a group of the form        ℤ  n   ⊕   ℤ   q  1    ⊕  ⋯  ⊕   ℤ   q  t     ,     direct-sum   superscript  ℤ  n    subscript  ℤ   subscript  q  1    normal-⋯   subscript  ℤ   subscript  q  t      \mathbb{Z}^{n}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{q_{1}}\oplus\cdots\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{q_{t}},   where the rank  n ≥ 0, and the numbers q 1 , ..., q t are powers of (not necessarily distinct) prime numbers. In particular, G is finite if and only if n = 0. The values of n , q 1 , ..., q t are ( up to rearranging the indices) uniquely determined by G .  Invariant factor decomposition  We can also write any finitely generated abelian group G as a direct sum of the form        ℤ  n   ⊕   ℤ   k  1    ⊕  ⋯  ⊕   ℤ   k  u     ,     direct-sum   superscript  ℤ  n    subscript  ℤ   subscript  k  1    normal-⋯   subscript  ℤ   subscript  k  u      \mathbb{Z}^{n}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{k_{1}}\oplus\cdots\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{k_{u}},   where k 1  divides  k 2 , which divides k 3 and so on up to k u . Again, the rank n and the invariant factors  k 1 , ..., k u are uniquely determined by G (here with a unique order).  Equivalence  These statements are equivalent because of the Chinese remainder theorem , which here states that     ℤ  m   ≃    ℤ  j   ⊕   ℤ  k       similar-to-or-equals   subscript  ℤ  m    direct-sum   subscript  ℤ  j    subscript  ℤ  k      \mathbb{Z}_{m}\simeq\mathbb{Z}_{j}\oplus\mathbb{Z}_{k}   if and only if j and k are coprime and m = jk .  Corollaries  Stated differently the fundamental theorem says that a finitely generated abelian group is the direct sum of a free abelian group of finite rank and a finite abelian group, each of those being unique up to isomorphism. The finite abelian group is just the torsion subgroup of G . The rank of G is defined as the rank of the torsion-free part of G ; this is just the number n in the above formulas.  A corollary to the fundamental theorem is that every finitely generated torsion-free abelian group is free abelian. The finitely generated condition is essential here   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   is torsion-free but not free abelian.  Every subgroup and factor group of a finitely generated abelian group is again finitely generated abelian. The finitely generated abelian groups, together with the group homomorphisms , form an abelian category which is a Serre subcategory of the category of abelian groups .  Non-finitely generated abelian groups  Note that not every abelian group of finite rank is finitely generated; the rank 1 group   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   is one counterexample, and the rank-0 group given by a direct sum of countably infinitely many copies of    ℤ  2     subscript  ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}_{2}   is another one.
