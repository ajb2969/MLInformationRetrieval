   Abel equation of the first kind      Abel equation of the first kind   In mathematics , an Abel equation of the first kind , named after Niels Henrik Abel , is any ordinary differential equation that is cubic in the unknown function. In other words, it is an equation of the form       y  ′   =     f  3    (  x  )    y  3    +    f  2    (  x  )    y  2    +    f  1    (  x  )   y   +    f  0    (  x  )          superscript  y  normal-′        subscript  f  3   x   superscript  y  3       subscript  f  2   x   superscript  y  2       subscript  f  1   x  y      subscript  f  0   x      y^{\prime}=f_{3}(x)y^{3}+f_{2}(x)y^{2}+f_{1}(x)y+f_{0}(x)\,     where      f  3    (  x  )    ≠  0         subscript  f  3   x   0    f_{3}(x)\neq 0   . If      f  3    (  x  )    =  0         subscript  f  3   x   0    f_{3}(x)=0   and      f  0    (  x  )    =  0         subscript  f  0   x   0    f_{0}(x)=0   , or      f  2    (  x  )    =  0         subscript  f  2   x   0    f_{2}(x)=0   and      f  0    (  x  )    =  0         subscript  f  0   x   0    f_{0}(x)=0   , the equation reduces to a Bernoulli equation , while if      f  3    (  x  )    =  0         subscript  f  3   x   0    f_{3}(x)=0   the equation reduces to a Riccati equation .  Properties  The substitution    y  =    1  u        y    1  u     y=\dfrac{1}{u}   brings the Abel equation of the first kind to the " Abel equation of the second kind " of the form        u   u  ′    =    -    f  0    (  x  )    u  3     -    f  1    (  x  )    u  2    -    f  2    (  x  )   u   -    f  3    (  x  )      .        u   superscript  u  normal-′           subscript  f  0   x   superscript  u  3        subscript  f  1   x   superscript  u  2       subscript  f  2   x  u      subscript  f  3   x      uu^{\prime}=-f_{0}(x)u^{3}-f_{1}(x)u^{2}-f_{2}(x)u-f_{3}(x).\,     The substitution     ξ   ξ   \displaystyle\xi     brings the Abel equation of the first kind to the canonical form        u  ′   =    u  3   +   ϕ   (  ξ  )      .       superscript  u  normal-′      superscript  u  3     ϕ  ξ      u^{\prime}=u^{3}+\phi(\xi).\,     Dimitrios E. Panayotounakos and Theodoros I. Zarmpoutis discovered an analytic method to solve the above equation generally. 1  Notes  References   On the Solution of the Unforced Damped Dufﬁng Oscillator with No Linear Stiffness Term  Construction of Exact Parametric or Closed Form Solutions of Some Unsolvable Classes of Nonlinear ODEs (Abel's Nonlinear ODEs of the First Kind and Relative Degenerate Equations)  Mancas, Stefan C., Rosu, Haret C., Integrable dissipative nonlinear second order differential equations via factorizations and Abel equations .
