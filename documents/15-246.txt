Abel equation of the first kind

In mathematics, an Abel equation of the first kind, named after Niels Henrik Abel, is any ordinary differential equation that is cubic in the unknown function. In other words, it is an equation of the form



where 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the equation reduces to a Bernoulli equation, while if 
 
 
 
  the equation reduces to a Riccati equation.
Properties
The substitution 
 
 
 
  brings the Abel equation of the first kind to the "Abel equation of the second kind" of the form



The substitution



brings the Abel equation of the first kind to the canonical form



Dimitrios E. Panayotounakos and Theodoros I. Zarmpoutis discovered an analytic method to solve the above equation generally.1
