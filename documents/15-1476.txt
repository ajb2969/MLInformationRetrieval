Glucosylglycerate synthase




Glucosylglycerate synthase

Glucosylglycerate synthase (, Ggs (gene)) is an enzyme with system name ADP-glucose:D-glycerate 2-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ADP-glucose + D-glycerate

 
  2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-D-glycerate + ADP
 

Persephonella marina possesses two enzymatic systems for the synthesis of glucosylglycerate.
