Log-spectral distance

The log-spectral distance (LSD), also referred to as log-spectral distortion, is a distance measure (expressed in dB) between two spectra. The log-spectral distance between spectra 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is defined as:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are power spectra. Unlike the Itakura–Saito distance, the log-spectral distance is symmetric.
