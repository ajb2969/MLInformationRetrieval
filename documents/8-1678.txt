   Fiber bundle construction theorem      Fiber bundle construction theorem   In mathematics , the fiber bundle construction theorem is a theorem which constructs a fiber bundle from a given base space, fiber and a suitable set of transition functions . The theorem also gives conditions under which two such bundles are isomorphic . The theorem is important in the associated bundle construction where one starts with a given bundle and surgically replaces the fiber with a new space while keeping all other data the same.  Formal statement  Let X and F be topological spaces and let G be a topological group with a continuous left action on F . Given an open cover { U i } of X and a set of continuous functions       t   i  j    :     U  i   ∩   U  j    →   G       normal-:   subscript  t    i  j     normal-→     subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j    G     t_{ij}:U_{i}\cap U_{j}\to G\,   defined on each nonempty overlap, such that the cocycle condition         t   i  k     (  x  )    =    t   i  j     (  x  )    t   j  k     (  x  )       ∀  x   ∈    U  i   ∩   U  j   ∩   U  k        formulae-sequence       subscript  t    i  k    x      subscript  t    i  j    x   subscript  t    j  k    x       for-all  x      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j    subscript  U  k       t_{ik}(x)=t_{ij}(x)t_{jk}(x)\qquad\forall x\in U_{i}\cap U_{j}\cap U_{k}   holds, there exists a fiber bundle E → X with fiber F and structure group G that is trivializable over { U i } with transition functions t ij .  Let E ′ be another fiber bundle with the same base space, fiber, structure group, and trivializing neighborhoods, but transition functions t ′ ij . If the action of G on F is faithful , then E ′ and E are isomorphic if and only if there exist functions       t  i   :    U  i   →   G       normal-:   subscript  t  i    normal-→   subscript  U  i   G     t_{i}:U_{i}\to G\,   such that          t   i  j   ′    (  x  )    =    t  i     (  x  )    -  1     t   i  j     (  x  )    t  j    (  x  )       ∀  x   ∈    U  i   ∩   U  j      .     formulae-sequence       subscript   superscript  t  normal-′     i  j    x      subscript  t  i    superscript  x    1     subscript  t    i  j    x   subscript  t  j   x       for-all  x      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j       t^{\prime}_{ij}(x)=t_{i}(x)^{-1}t_{ij}(x)t_{j}(x)\qquad\forall x\in U_{i}\cap U%
 _{j}.   Taking t i to be constant functions to the identity in G , we see that two fiber bundles with the same base, fiber, structure group, trivializing neighborhoods, and transition functions are isomorphic.  A similar theorem holds in the smooth category, where X and Y are smooth manifolds , G is a Lie group with a smooth left action on Y and the maps t ij are all smooth.  Construction  The proof of the theorem is constructive . That is, it actually constructs a fiber bundle with the given properties. One starts by taking the disjoint union of the product spaces  U i × F      T  =    ∐   i  ∈  I      U  i   ×  F    =   {   (  i  ,  x  ,  y  )   :    i  ∈  I   ,    x  ∈   U  i    ,   y  ∈  F     }         T    subscript  coproduct    i  I       subscript  U  i   F          conditional-set   i  x  y    formulae-sequence    i  I    formulae-sequence    x   subscript  U  i      y  F         T=\coprod_{i\in I}U_{i}\times F=\{(i,x,y):i\in I,x\in U_{i},y\in F\}   and then forms the quotient by the equivalence relation         (  j  ,  x  ,  y  )   ∼   (  i  ,  x  ,     t   i  j     (  x  )    ⋅  y   )       ∀  x   ∈    U  i   ∩   U  j     ,   y  ∈  F     .     formulae-sequence   similar-to   j  x  y    i  x   normal-⋅     subscript  t    i  j    x   y      formulae-sequence     for-all  x      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j       y  F      (j,x,y)\sim(i,x,t_{ij}(x)\cdot y)\qquad\forall x\in U_{i}\cap U_{j},y\in F.   The total space E of the bundle is T /~ and the projection π : E → X is the map which sends the equivalence class of ( i , x , y ) to x . The local trivializations       ϕ  i   :     π   -  1     (   U  i   )    →    U  i   ×   F        normal-:   subscript  ϕ  i    normal-→     superscript  π    1     subscript  U  i       subscript  U  i   F      \phi_{i}:\pi^{-1}(U_{i})\to U_{i}\times F\,   are then defined by         ϕ  i   -  1     (  x  ,  y  )    =   [   (  i  ,  x  ,  y  )   ]    .         superscript   subscript  ϕ  i     1     x  y     delimited-[]   i  x  y      \phi_{i}^{-1}(x,y)=[(i,x,y)].     Associated bundle  Let E → X a fiber bundle with fiber F and structure group G , and let F ′ be another left G -space. One can form an associated bundle E ′ → X a with fiber F ′ and structure group G by taking any local trivialization of E and replacing F by F ′ in the construction theorem. If one takes F ′ to be G with the action of left multiplication then one obtains the associated principal bundle .  References     See Part I, §2.10 and §3.
