Separable filter

A separable filter in image processing can be written as product of two more simple filters. Typically a 2-dimensional convolution operation is separated into 2 onedimensional filters. This reduces the cost of computing the operator.
Examples
1. A twodimensional smoothing filter is separated in this sample:



2. Gaussian blur (smoothing)



3. Sobel operator (edge detection)



This works also for Prewitt operator.
