   Exner equation      Exner equation   (Figure)  This rock belonging to University of Minnesota Professor of Geology Chris Paola is inscribed with the Exner equation.   The Exner equation is a statement of conservation of mass that applies to sediment in a fluvial system such as a river . 1 It was developed by the Austrian meteorologist and sedimentologist Felix Maria Exner , from whom it derives its name. 2  The equation  The Exner equation describes conservation of mass between sediment in the bed of a channel and sediment that is being transported . It states that bed elevation increases (the bed aggrades ) proportionally to the amount of sediment that drops out of transport, and conversely decreases (the bed degrades ) proportionally to the amount of sediment that becomes entrained by the flow.  Basic equation  The equation states that the change in bed elevation,   η   η   \eta   , over time,   t   t   t   , is equal to one over the grain packing density,    ε  o     subscript  ε  o    \varepsilon_{o}   , times the negative divergence of sediment flux ,    q  s     subscript  q  s    q_{s}   .        ∂  η    ∂  t    =   -     1   ε  o    ∇   ⋅   𝐪  𝐬             η     t       normal-⋅      1   subscript  ε  o    normal-∇    subscript  𝐪  𝐬       \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t}=-\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{o}}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{q%
 _{s}}     Note that    ε  o     subscript  ε  o    \varepsilon_{o}   can also be expressed as    (   1  -   λ  p    )      1   subscript  λ  p     (1-\lambda_{p})   , where    λ  p     subscript  λ  p    \lambda_{p}   equals the bed porosity .  Good values of    ε  o     subscript  ε  o    \varepsilon_{o}   for natural systems range from 0.45 to 0.75. 3 A typical good value for spherical grains is 0.64, as given by random close packing . An upper bound for close-packed spherical grains is 0.74048. (See sphere packing for more details); this degree of packing is extremely improbable in natural systems, making random close packing the more realistic upper bound on grain packing density.  Often, for reasons of computational convenience and/or lack of data, the Exner equation is used in its one-dimensional form. This is generally done with respect to the down-stream direction   x   x   x   , as one is typically interested in the down-stream distribution of erosion and deposition though a river reach.        ∂  η    ∂  t    =   -    1   ε  o      ∂   𝐪  𝐬     ∂  x              η     t          1   subscript  ε  o         subscript  𝐪  𝐬      x        \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t}=-\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{o}}\frac{\partial%
 \mathbf{q_{s}}}{\partial x}     Including external changes in elevation  An additional form of the Exner equation adds a subsidence term,   σ   σ   \sigma   , to the mass-balance. This allows the absolute elevation of the bed   η   η   \eta   to be tracked over time in a situation in which it is being changed by outside influences, such as tectonic or compression-related subsidence ( isostatic compression or rebound ). In the convention of the following equation,   σ   σ   \sigma   is positive with an increase in elevation over time and is negative with a decrease in elevation over time.        ∂  η    ∂  t    =    -     1   ε  o    ∇   ⋅   𝐪  𝐬     +  σ           η     t         normal-⋅      1   subscript  ε  o    normal-∇    subscript  𝐪  𝐬     σ     \frac{\partial\eta}{\partial t}=-\frac{1}{\varepsilon_{o}}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{q%
