Fatty-acid peroxidase

In enzymology, a fatty-acid peroxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

palmitate + 2 H2O2

 
  pentadecanal + CO2 + 3 H2O
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are palmitate and H2O2, whereas its 3 products are pentadecanal, CO2, and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a peroxide as acceptor (peroxidases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is hexadecanoate:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called long chain fatty acid peroxidase.
