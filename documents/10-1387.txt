   Fatty-acid peroxidase      Fatty-acid peroxidase   In enzymology , a fatty-acid peroxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   palmitate + 2 H 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pentadecanal + CO 2 + 3 H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are palmitate and H 2 O 2 , whereas its 3 products are pentadecanal , CO 2 , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a peroxide as acceptor (peroxidases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is hexadecanoate:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called long chain fatty acid peroxidase .
