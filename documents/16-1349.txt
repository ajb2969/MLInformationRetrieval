Ore algebra

In computer algebra, an Ore algebra is a special kind of iterated Ore extension that can be used to represent linear functional operators, including linear differential and/or recurrence operators.1 The concept is named after Øystein Ore.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a (commutative) field and 
 
 
 
  be a commutative polynomial ring (with 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 ). The iterated skew polynomial ring

 
  is called an Ore algebra when the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  commute for 
 
 
 
 , and satisfy 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
Ore algebras satisfy the Ore condition, and thus can be embedded in a (skew) field of fractions.
The constraint of commutation in the definition makes Ore algebras have a non-commutative generalization theory of Gröbner basis for their left ideals.
