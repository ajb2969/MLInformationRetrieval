   Ore algebra      Ore algebra   In computer algebra , an Ore algebra is a special kind of iterated Ore extension that can be used to represent linear functional operators, including linear differential and/or recurrence operators. 1 The concept is named after Øystein Ore .  Definition  Let   K   K   K   be a (commutative) field and    A  =   K   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  s   ]        A    K    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  s       A=K[x_{1},\ldots,x_{s}]   be a commutative polynomial ring (with    A  =  K      A  K    A=K   when    s  =  0      s  0    s=0   ). The iterated skew polynomial ring     A   [   ∂  1   ;   σ  1   ,   δ  1   ]   ⋯   [   ∂  r   ;   σ  r   ,   δ  r   ]       A    subscript   1    subscript  σ  1    subscript  δ  1    normal-⋯    subscript   r    subscript  σ  r    subscript  δ  r      A[\partial_{1};\sigma_{1},\delta_{1}]\cdots[\partial_{r};\sigma_{r},\delta_{r}]   is called an Ore algebra when the    σ  i     subscript  σ  i    \sigma_{i}   and    δ  j     subscript  δ  j    \delta_{j}   commute for    i  ≠  j      i  j    i\neq j   , and satisfy      σ  i    (   ∂  j   )    =   ∂  j          subscript  σ  i    subscript   j     subscript   j     \sigma_{i}(\partial_{j})=\partial_{j}   ,      δ  i    (   ∂  j   )    =  0         subscript  δ  i    subscript   j    0    \delta_{i}(\partial_{j})=0   for    i  >  j      i  j    i>j   .  Properties  Ore algebras satisfy the Ore condition , and thus can be embedded in a (skew) field of fractions.  The constraint of commutation in the definition makes Ore algebras have a non-commutative generalization theory of Gröbner basis for their left ideals.
