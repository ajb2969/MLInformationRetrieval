   Unisolvent point set      Unisolvent point set   In approximation theory , a finite collection of points    X  ⊂   R  n       X   superscript  R  n     X\subset R^{n}   is often called unisolvent for a space   W   W   W   if any element    w  ∈  W      w  W    w\in W   is uniquely determined by its values on   X   X   X   .    X   X   X   is unisolvent for    Π  n  m     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  m   n    \Pi^{m}_{n}   (polynomials in n variables of degree at most m) if there exists a unique polynomial in    Π  n  m     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  m   n    \Pi^{m}_{n}   of lowest possible degree which interpolates the data   X   X   X   .  Simple examples in   R   R   R   would be the fact that two distinct points determine a line, three points determine a parabola, etc. It is clear that over   R   R   R   , any collection of k + 1 distinct points will uniquely determine a polynomial of lowest possible degree in    Π  k     superscript  normal-Π  k    \Pi^{k}   .
