Unisolvent point set

In approximation theory, a finite collection of points 
 
 
 
  is often called unisolvent for a space 
 
 
 
  if any element 
 
 
 
  is uniquely determined by its values on 
 
 
 
 .

 
  is unisolvent for 
 
 
 
  (polynomials in n variables of degree at most m) if there exists a unique polynomial in 
 
 
 
  of lowest possible degree which interpolates the data 
 
 
 
 .
Simple examples in 
 
 
 
  would be the fact that two distinct points determine a line, three points determine a parabola, etc. It is clear that over 
 
 
 
 , any collection of k + 1 distinct points will uniquely determine a polynomial of lowest possible degree in 
 
 
 
 .
