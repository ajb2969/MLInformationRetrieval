Malliavin derivative

In mathematics, the Malliavin derivative is a notion of derivative in the Malliavin calculus. Intuitively, it is the notion of derivative appropriate to paths in classical Wiener space, which are "usually" not differentiable in the usual sense. 
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Cameron–Martin space, and 
 
 
 
  denote classical Wiener space:


 
 ;



By the Sobolev embedding theorem, 
 
 
 
 . Let


 
  denote the inclusion map.
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  is Fréchet differentiable. Then the Fréchet derivative is a map



i.e., for paths 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is an element of 
 
 
 
 , the dual space to 
 
 
 
 . Denote by 
 
 
 
  the continuous linear map

 
  defined by



sometimes known as the H-derivative. Now define 
 
 
 
  to be the adjoint of 
 
 
 
  in the sense that



Then the Malliavin derivative

 
  is defined by



The domain of 
 
 
 
  is the set 
 
 
 
  of all Fréchet differentiable real-valued functions on 
 
 
 
 ; the codomain is 
 
 
 
 .
The Skorokhod integral

 
  is defined to be the adjoint of the Malliavin derivative:
