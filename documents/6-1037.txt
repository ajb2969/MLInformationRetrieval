Raised cosine distribution

In probability theory and statistics, the raised cosine distribution is a continuous probability distribution supported on the interval 
 
 
 
 . The probability density function (pdf) is



for 
 
 
 
  and zero otherwise. The cumulative distribution function is



for 
 
 
 
  and zero for 
 
 
 
  and unity for 
 
 
 
 .
The moments of the raised cosine distribution are somewhat complicated, but are considerably simplified for the standard raised cosine distribution. The standard raised cosine distribution is just the raised cosine distribution with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Because the standard raised cosine distribution is an even function, the odd moments are zero. The even moments are given by:






where 
 
 
 
  is a generalized hypergeometric function.
Differential equation
The pdf of the raised cosine distribution is a solution to the following differential equation:
