Lipoate—protein ligase

Lipoate—protein ligase (, LplA, lipoate protein ligase, lipoate-protein ligase A, LPL, LPL-B) is an enzyme with system name ATP:lipoate adenylyltransferase.1234567 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) ATP + lipoate

diphosphate + lipoyl-AMP
 
(2) lipoyl-AMP + apoprotein
