In probability theory and statistics, the skew normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution that generalises the normal distribution to allow for non-zero skewness.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the standard normal probability density function


 
  with the cumulative distribution function given by


 
 ,
where erf is the error function. Then the probability density function (pdf) of the skew-normal distribution with parameter 
 
 
 
  is given by



This distribution was first introduced by O'Hagan and Leonard (1976).
A stochastic process that underpins the distribution was described by Andel, Netuka and Zvara (1984).1 Both the distribution and its stochastic process underpinnings were consequences of the symmetry argument developed in Chan and Tong (1986), which applies to multivariate cases beyond normality, e.g. skew multivariate t distribution and others.
To add location and scale parameters to this, one makes the usual transform 
 
 
 
 . One can verify that the normal distribution is recovered when 
 
 
 
 , and that the absolute value of the skewness increases as the absolute value of 
 
 
 
  increases. The distribution is right skewed if 
 
 
 
  and is left skewed if 
 
 
 
 . The probability density function with location 
 
 
 
 , scale 
 
 
 
 , and parameter 
 
 
 
  becomes


 
  Note, however, that the skewness of the distribution is limited to the interval 
 
 
 
 .
Estimation
Maximum likelihood estimates for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  can be computed numerically, but no closed-form expression for the estimates is available unless 
 
 
 
 . If a closed-form expression is needed, the method of moments can be applied to estimate 
 
 
 
  from the sample skew, by inverting the skewness equation. This yields the estimate



where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the sample skew. The sign of 
 
 
 
  is the same as the sign of 
 
 
 
 . Consequently, 
 
 
 
 .
The maximum (theoretical) skewness is obtained by setting 
 
 
 
  in the skewness equation, giving 
 
 
 
 . However it is possible that the sample skewness is larger, and then 
 
 
 
  cannot be determined from these equations. When using the method of moments in an automatic fashion, for example to give starting values for maximum likelihood iteration, one should therefore let (for example) 
 
 
 
 .
Concern has been expressed about the impact of skew normal methods on the reliability of inferences based upon them.2
Differential equation
The differential equation leading to the pdf of the skew normal distribution is
