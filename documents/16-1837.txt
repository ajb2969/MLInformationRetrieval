   Inserter category      Inserter category   In category theory , a branch of mathematics , the inserter category is a way of constructing a new category from two functors between two categories.  Definition  If C and D are two categories and F and G are two functors from C to D , the inserter category Ins ( F , G ) is the category whose objects are pairs ( X , f ) where X is an object of C and f is a morphism in D from F ( X ) to G ( X ) and whose morphisms from ( X , f ) to ( Y , g ) are morphisms h in C from X to Y such that      G   (  h  )    ∘  f   =    g  ∘  F    (  h  )            G  h   f       g  F   h     G(h)\circ f=g\circ F(h)   .  Properties  A natural transformation from F to G is equivalently a section of the forgetful functor from Ins ( F , G ) to C .  See also   Comma category   References  "  Category:Category theory
