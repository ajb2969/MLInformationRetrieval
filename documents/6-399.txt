   Distribution ensemble      Distribution ensemble   In cryptography , a distribution ensemble or probability ensemble is a family of distributions or random variables     X  =    {   X  i   }    i  ‚àà  I        X   subscript    subscript  X  i      i  I      X=\{X_{i}\}_{i\in I}   where   I   I   I   is a ( countable ) index set, and each    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   is a random variable, or probability distribution. Often    I  =  ùí©      I  ùí©    I=\mathcal{N}   and it is required that each    X  n     subscript  X  n    X_{n}   have a certain property for n sufficiently large.  A uniform ensemble     U  =    {   U  n   }    n  ‚àà  ‚Ñï        U   subscript    subscript  U  n      n  ‚Ñï      U=\{U_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   is a distribution ensemble , uniformly distributed over strings of length n .
