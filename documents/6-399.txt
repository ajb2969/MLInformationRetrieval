Distribution ensemble

In cryptography, a distribution ensemble or probability ensemble is a family of distributions or random variables

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a (countable) index set, and each 
 
 
 
  is a random variable, or probability distribution. Often 
 
 
 
  and it is required that each 
 
 
 
  have a certain property for n sufficiently large.
A uniform ensemble

 
  is a distribution ensemble, uniformly distributed over strings of lengthÂ n.
