   Dual basis      Dual basis   In linear algebra , given a vector space  V with a basis B of vectors indexed by an index set  I (the cardinality of I is the dimensionality of V ), its dual set is a set B ∗ of vectors in the dual space  V ∗ with the same index set I such that B and B ∗ form a biorthogonal system . The dual set is always linearly independent but does not necessarily span V ∗ . If it does span V ∗ , then B ∗ is called the dual basis for the basis B .  Denoting the indexed vector sets as    B  =    {   v  i   }    i  ∈  I        B   subscript    subscript  v  i      i  I      B=\{v_{i}\}_{i\in I}   and     B  *   =    {   v  i   }    i  ∈  I         superscript  B     subscript    superscript  v  i      i  I      B^{*}=\{v^{i}\}_{i\in I}   , being biorthogonal means that the elements pair to 1 if the indexes are equal, and to zero otherwise. Symbolically, evaluating a dual vector in V ∗ on a vector in the original space V :        v  i    (   v  j   )    =   δ  j  i   =   {     1      if  i   =  j       0      if  i   ≠   j  ,                 superscript  v  i    subscript  v  j     subscript   superscript  δ  i   j         cases  1      if  i   j   0      if  i     j  ,        v^{i}(v_{j})=\delta^{i}_{j}=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }i=j\\
 0&\text{if }i\neq j\text{,}\end{cases}   where    δ  j  i     subscript   superscript  δ  i   j    \delta^{i}_{j}   is the Kronecker delta symbol.  A categorical and algebraic construction of the dual space  Another way to introduce the dual space of a vector space ( module ) is by introducing it in a categorical sense. To do this, let   A   A   A   be a module defined over the ring   R   R   R   (that is,   A   A   A   is an object in the category    R  -  𝐌𝐨𝐝      R  -  𝐌𝐨𝐝    R\text{-}\mathbf{Mod}   ). Then we define the dual space of   A   A   A   , denoted    A  ∗     superscript  A  normal-∗    A^{\ast}   , to be     Hom  R    (  A  ,  R  )        subscript  Hom  R    A  R     \text{Hom}_{R}(A,R)   , the module formed of all   R   R   R   -linear module homomorphisms from   A   A   A   into   R   R   R   . Note then that we may define a dual to the dual, referred to as the double dual of   A   A   A   , written as    A    ∗  ∗      superscript  A   normal-∗  absent  normal-∗     A^{\ast\ast}   , and defined as     Hom  R    (   A  ∗   ,  R  )        subscript  Hom  R     superscript  A  normal-∗   R     \text{Hom}_{R}(A^{\ast},R)   .  To formally construct a basis for the dual space, we shall now restrict our view to the case where   F   F   F   is a finite-dimensional free (left)   R   R   R   -module, where   R   R   R   is a ring of unity. Then, we assume that the set   X   X   X   is a basis for   F   F   F   . From here, we define the Kronecker Delta function    δ   x  y      subscript  δ    x  y     \delta_{xy}   over the basis   X   X   X   by     δ   x  y    =  1       subscript  δ    x  y    1    \delta_{xy}=1   if    x  =  y      x  y    x=y   and     δ   x  y    =  0       subscript  δ    x  y    0    \delta_{xy}=0   if    x  ≠  y      x  y    x\neq y   . Then the set    S  =   {   f  x   :  F  →   R   |   f  x    (  y  )   =   δ   x  y    }      fragments  S    fragments  normal-{   subscript  f  x   normal-:  F  normal-→  R  normal-|   subscript  f  x    fragments  normal-(  y  normal-)     subscript  δ    x  y    normal-}     S=\{f_{x}:F\to R\;|\;f_{x}(y)=\delta_{xy}\}   describes a linearly independent set with each     f  x   ∈    Hom  R    (  F  ,  R  )         subscript  f  x      subscript  Hom  R    F  R      f_{x}\in\text{Hom}_{R}(F,R)   . Since   F   F   F   is finite-dimensional, the basis   X   X   X   is of finite cardinality. Then, the set   S   S   S   is a basis to    F  ∗     superscript  F  normal-∗    F^{\ast}   and    F  ∗     superscript  F  normal-∗    F^{\ast}   is a free (right)   R   R   R   -module.  Existence and uniqueness  The dual set always exists and gives an injection from V into V ∗ , namely the mapping that sends v i to v i . This says, in particular, that the dual space has dimension greater or equal to that of V .  However, the dual set of an infinite-dimensional V does not span its dual space V ∗ . For example, consider the map w in V ∗ from V into the underlying scalars F given by for all i . This map is clearly nonzero on all v i . If w were a finite linear combination of the dual basis vectors v i , say    w  =    ∑   i  ∈  K      α  i    v  i         w    subscript     i  K       subscript  α  i    superscript  v  i       w=\sum_{i\in K}\alpha_{i}v^{i}   for a finite subset K of I , then for any j not in K ,     w   (   v  j   )    =    (    ∑   i  ∈  K      α  i    v  i     )    (   v  j   )    =  0          w   subscript  v  j        subscript     i  K       subscript  α  i    superscript  v  i      subscript  v  j         0     w(v_{j})=(\sum_{i\in K}\alpha_{i}v^{i})(v_{j})=0   , contradicting the definition of w . So, this w does not lie in the span of the dual set.  The dual of an infinite-dimensional space has greater dimensionality (this being a greater infinite cardinality) than the original space has, and thus these cannot have a basis with the same indexing set. However, a dual set of vectors exists, which defines a subspace of the dual isomorphic to the original space. Further, for topological vector spaces , a continuous dual space can be defined, in which case a dual basis may exist.   Finite-dimensional vector spaces   In the case of finite-dimensional vector spaces, the dual set is always a dual basis and it is unique. These bases are denoted by  and . If one denotes the evaluation of a covector on a vector as a pairing, the biorthogonality condition becomes:        ⟨   e  i   ,   e  j   ⟩   =   δ  j  i    .        superscript  e  i    subscript  e  j     subscript   superscript  δ  i   j     \left\langle e^{i},e_{j}\right\rangle=\delta^{i}_{j}.     The association of a dual basis with a basis gives a map from the space of bases of V to the space of bases of V ∗ , and this is also an isomorphism. For topological fields such as the real numbers, the space of duals is a topological space , and this gives a homeomorphism between the Stiefel manifolds of bases of these spaces.  Introduction  To perform operations with a vector, we must have a straightforward method of calculating its components. In a Cartesian frame the necessary operation is simple dot product by the base vector.  e.g.    𝐱  =     x  1    𝐢  1    +    x  2    𝐢  2    +    x  3    𝐢  3         𝐱       superscript  x  1    subscript  𝐢  1       superscript  x  2    subscript  𝐢  2       superscript  x  3    subscript  𝐢  3       \mathbf{x}=x^{1}\mathbf{i}_{1}+x^{2}\mathbf{i}_{2}+x^{3}\mathbf{i}_{3}     where    𝐢  k     subscript  𝐢  k    \mathbf{i}_{k}   is the bases in Cartesian frame.The components of   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   can be found by       x  k   =   𝐱  ⋅   𝐢  k         superscript  x  k    normal-⋅  𝐱   subscript  𝐢  k      x^{k}=\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{i}_{k}     In non-Cartesian frame, we do not necessarily have e i · e j =0 for all i≠j. However, it may still be possible to find a vector e i such that       x  i   =  𝐱  ⋅   𝐞  i    (  i  =  1  ,  2  ,  3  )      fragments   superscript  x  i    x  normal-⋅   superscript  𝐞  i   italic-   fragments  normal-(  i   1  normal-,  2  normal-,  3  normal-)     x^{i}=\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{e}^{i}\qquad(i=1,2,3)   .  the equality holds when e i is the dual base of e i  In Cartesian frame, we have     𝐞  k   =   𝐞  k   =   𝐢  k          superscript  𝐞  k    subscript  𝐞  k         subscript  𝐢  k      \mathbf{e}^{k}=\mathbf{e}_{k}=\mathbf{i}_{k}     Examples  For example, the standard basis vectors of R 2 (the Cartesian plane ) are       {   𝐞  1   ,   𝐞  2   }   =   {   (     1      0     )   ,   (     0      1     )   }         subscript  𝐞  1    subscript  𝐞  2       1    0      0    1       \{\mathbf{e}_{1},\mathbf{e}_{2}\}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}1\\
 0\end{pmatrix},\begin{pmatrix}0\\
 1\end{pmatrix}\right\}   and the standard basis vectors of its dual space R 2 * are       {   𝐞  1   ,   𝐞  2   }   =    {   (     1    0     )   ,   (     0    1     )   }   .         superscript  𝐞  1    superscript  𝐞  2         1  0      0  1     .     \{\mathbf{e}^{1},\mathbf{e}^{2}\}=\left\{\begin{pmatrix}1&0\end{pmatrix},%
 \begin{pmatrix}0&1\end{pmatrix}\right\}\text{.}     In 3-dimensional Euclidean space , for a given basis { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 }, you can find the biorthogonal (dual) basis { e 1 , e 2 , e 3 } by formulas below:         𝐞  1   =    (     𝐞  2   ×   𝐞  3    V   )   T    ,     𝐞  2   =    (     𝐞  3   ×   𝐞  1    V   )   T    ,    𝐞  3   =    (     𝐞  1   ×   𝐞  2    V   )   T      .     formulae-sequence     superscript  𝐞  1    superscript       subscript  𝐞  2    subscript  𝐞  3    V   T     formulae-sequence     superscript  𝐞  2    superscript       subscript  𝐞  3    subscript  𝐞  1    V   T       superscript  𝐞  3    superscript       subscript  𝐞  1    subscript  𝐞  2    V   T       \mathbf{e}^{1}=\left(\frac{\mathbf{e}_{2}\times\mathbf{e}_{3}}{V}\right)^{%
