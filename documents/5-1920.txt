   Spectral resolution      Spectral resolution   The spectral resolution of a spectrograph , or, more generally, of a frequency spectrum , is a measure of its ability to resolve features in the electromagnetic spectrum . It is usually denoted by    Δ  λ      normal-Δ  λ    \Delta\lambda   , and is closely related to the resolving power of the spectrograph, defined as      R  =   λ   Δ  λ        R    λ    normal-Δ  λ      R={\lambda\over\Delta\lambda}   ,  where    Δ  λ      normal-Δ  λ    \Delta\lambda   is the smallest difference in wavelengths that can be distinguished at a wavelength of   λ   λ   \lambda   . For example, the Space Telescope Imaging Spectrograph (STIS) can distinguish features 0.17 nm apart at a wavelength of 1000 nm, giving it a resolution of 0.17 nm and a resolving power of about 5,900. An example of a high resolution spectrograph is the Cryogenic High-Resolution IR  Echelle Spectrograph (CRIRES) installed at ESO 's Very Large Telescope , which has a spectral resolving power of up to 100,000. 1  Doppler effect  The spectral resolution can also be expressed in terms of physical quantities, such as velocity; then it describes the difference between velocities    Δ  v      normal-Δ  v    \Delta v   that can be distinguished through the Doppler effect . Then, the resolution is    Δ  v      normal-Δ  v    \Delta v   and the resolving power is      R  =   c   Δ  v        R    c    normal-Δ  v      R={c\over\Delta v}     where   c   c   c   is the speed of light . The STIS example above then has a spectral resolution of 51 km/s .  IUPAC definition  IUPAC defines resolution in optical spectroscopy as the minimum wavenumber, wavelength or frequency difference between two lines in a spectrum that can be distinguished. 2 Resolving power, R , is given by the transition wavenumber, wavelength or frequency, divided by the resolution. 3  See also   Angular resolution  Resolution (mass spectrometry)   References  Further reading   Kim Quijano, J., et al.
