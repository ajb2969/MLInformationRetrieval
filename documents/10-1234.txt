   Secondary-alcohol oxidase      Secondary-alcohol oxidase   In enzymology , a secondary-alcohol oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a secondary alcohol + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a ketone + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are secondary alcohol and O 2 , whereas its two products are ketone and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is secondary-alcohol:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include polyvinyl alcohol oxidase , and secondary alcohol oxidase .
