   3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid kinase      3-Deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid kinase   3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic acid kinase (, kdkA (gene) , Kdo kinase ) is an enzyme with system name ATP:(KDO)-lipid IVA 3-deoxy-alpha-D-manno-oct-2-ulopyranose 4-phosphotransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   alpha-Kdo-(2->6)-lipid IVA + ATP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-O-phospho-alpha-Kdo-(2->6)-lipid IVA + ADP   The enzyme phosphorylates the 4-OH position of KDO in (KDO)-lipid IVA.
