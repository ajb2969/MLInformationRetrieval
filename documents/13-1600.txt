   Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes      Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes   In algebraic geometry , a branch of mathematics , the Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes , named after Solomon Lefschetz , is a classical statement relating holomorphic line bundles on a compact  Kähler manifold to classes in its integral cohomology . It is the only case of the Hodge conjecture which has been proved for all Kähler manifolds. 1  Statement of the theorem  Let X be a compact Kähler manifold. The first Chern class  c 1 gives a map from holomorphic line bundles to . By Hodge theory , the de Rham cohomology group H 2 ( X , C ) decomposes as a direct sum , and it can be proven that the image of c 1 lies in H 1,1 ( X ). The theorem says that the map to is surjective.  In the special case where X is a projective variety , holomorphic line bundles are in bijection with linear equivalences class of divisors , and given a divisor D on X with associated line bundle O(D) , the class c 1 ( O(D) ) is Poincaré dual to the homology class given by D . Thus, this establishes the usual formulation of the Hodge conjecture for divisors in projective varieties.  Proof using normal functions  Lefschetz's original proof 2 worked on projective surfaces and used normal functions, which were introduced by Poincaré. Suppose that C t is a pencil of curves on X . Each of these curves has a Jacobian variety  JC t (if a curve is singular, there is an appropriate generalized Jacobian variety). These can be assembled into a family   𝒥   𝒥   \mathcal{J}   , the Jacobian of the pencil, which comes with a projection map π to the base T of the pencil. A normal function is a (holomorphic) section of π.  Fix an embedding of X in P N , and choose a pencil of curves C t on X . For a fixed curve Γ on X , the intersection of Γ and C t is a divisor on C t , where d is the degree of X . Fix a base point p 0 of the pencil. Then the divisor is a divisor of degree zero, and consequently it determines a class ν Γ ( t ) in the Jacobian JC t for all t . The map from t to ν Γ ( t ) is a normal function.  Henri Poincaré proved that for a general pencil of curves, all normal functions arose as ν Γ ( t ) for some choice of Γ. Lefschetz proved that any normal function determined a class in H 2 ( X , Z ) and that the class of ν Γ is the fundamental class of Γ. Furthermore, he proved that a class in H 2 ( X , Z ) is the class of a normal function if and only if it lies in H 1,1 . Together with Poincaré's existence theorem, this proves the theorem on (1,1)-classes.  Proof using sheaf cohomology  Because X is a complex manifold, it admits an exponential sheaf sequence 3      0  →   𝐙  ¯    ⟶   2  π  i     𝒪  X    ⟶  exp    𝒪  X  ×   →  0.       normal-→  0   normal-¯  𝐙      superscript  normal-⟶    2  π  i       subscript  𝒪  X      superscript  normal-⟶  exp      superscript   subscript  𝒪  X       normal-→    0.     0\to\underline{\mathbf{Z}}\stackrel{2\pi i}{\longrightarrow}\mathcal{O}_{X}%
 \stackrel{\operatorname{exp}}{\longrightarrow}\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\times}\to 0.   Taking sheaf cohomology of this exact sequence gives maps         H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X  ×   )     →   c  1      H  2    (  X  ,  𝐙  )     →   i  *      H  2    (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )     .        superscript  normal-→   subscript  c  1       superscript  H  1    X   superscript   subscript  𝒪  X          superscript  H  2    X  𝐙       superscript  normal-→   subscript  i          superscript  H  2    X   subscript  𝒪  X        H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\times})\stackrel{c_{1}}{\to}H^{2}(X,\mathbf{Z})%
 \stackrel{i_{*}}{\to}H^{2}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}).   The group  of line bundles on X is isomorphic to     H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X  ×   )        superscript  H  1    X   superscript   subscript  𝒪  X        H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{\times})   . The first Chern class map is c 1 by definition, so it suffices to show that i * is zero.  Because X is Kähler, Hodge theory implies that      H  2    (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )    ≅    H   0  ,  2     (  X  )           superscript  H  2    X   subscript  𝒪  X        superscript  H   0  2    X     H^{2}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})\cong H^{0,2}(X)   . However, i * factors through the map from H 2 ( X , Z ) to H 2 ( X , C ), and on H 2 ( X , C ), i * is the restriction of the projection onto H 0,2 ( X ). It follows that it is zero on , and consequently that the cycle class map is surjective. 4  References    Bibliography     Reprinted in   "  Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
