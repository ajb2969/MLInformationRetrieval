   Template:Image label marker/doc      Template:Image label marker/doc   Usage  Purpose  The purpose of this template is to allow accurate placement of an image and/or text label over another source image, irrespective of scaling of the source image. It is based on the  template. However, a drawback with that template is that the placement gets slightly inaccurate if you scale the source image (because of the way calculations are done), and thus you might have to manually recalculate the placement.  This template also has similarities with the  template. That template however sadly doesn't allow for scaling. It is also limited to 30 labels, although for most purposes that is probably more than enough.  This template is however much more bloated than either of those templates, and you might want to consider if you can use one of the templates that are simpler and easier to use.  Example usage    This template assumes you first introduce a background image by calling . By doing so this also requires it to be ended with . Example with two smilies  placed as the “eyes” on this beach image.  {{Image label begin|image=Beach Smile.jpg|float=right|title=Example}}
 {{Image label marker|x=1079|y=1033|image=Face-grin.svg|marker_size=15|x_orig=2749}}
 {{Image label marker|x=1601|y=1020|image=Face-grin.svg|marker_size=15|x_orig=2749}}
 {{Image label end}}  For full list of available options/parameters see further below. In this example the following are used   Image label begin}}  .  x_orig = 2749 is in this example the width of the original beach image, which can be found out through various methods. One way to find out is the way Wikipedia/Commons lists it below the image where it says “Full resolution” when you view the image information and its license.  x = 1079 is the x-coordinate on the full resolution image where the  is to be placed. There are various methods to find out this, and depends on what tools you have available.  y = 1033 is the y-coordinate on the full resolution image where the  is to be placed.  image = Face-grin.svg is the image to be used as a marker, since the default marker image  is not used.  marker_size = 15 is the width of the marker image .     If scaling the beach image down (or up), the only changes that need to be done is changing every occurrence of the width parameter, and the placement of overlying marker images (and their corresponding text) should scale accordingly.  {{Image label begin|image=Beach Smile.jpg|float=right|title=Example}}

 }}  Please note that many of these parameters are used in calculations. Due to constraints the template will think a parameter that is given, but is actually empty or contains spaces, still has a value and thus will give an error during calculations. The error might look something like this: {{#expr: 0+}}.

 }+y_{adjust}+y_{textadjust}     Template parameters  None of the template parameters are technically required, however not supplying a few of them will make the template behave oddly, or make the use of this template unnecessary. For this reason some of the parameters are listed as "required".      Parameter name   Alternate names   Required   Description   Recommended values       x_marker_orig   x x-marker-orig   yes   The horizontal x -location on the original image where you want the centre of the marker to be located.   1 … x orig     y_marker_orig   y y-marker-orig   yes   The vertical y -location on the original image where you want the centre of the marker to be located.       x_scaled   scale width x-scaled   yes   The width of the resized image in pixels. Default is scaling it down (or up) to 250 pixels.       y_scaled   height y-scaled   no   The calculated height of the resized image in pixels. Note that the actual image height is implicitly set with . Thus y scaled is mainly used internally, and by default it is calculated based on x scaled . If you do use this parameter, then you should also fill in a value for y orig or the calculations will end up wrong.       x_orig   width_orig x-orig width-orig   yes   The width of the original image in pixels. If this value isn't corresponding with the original image's actual width, the calculations may be faulty.      y_orig   height_orig y-orig height-orig   no   The height of the original image in pixels. If this value isn't corresponding with the original image's actual height, the calculations may be faulty. You need to fill in a value for this parameter if you already used the y scaled parameter option, otherwise the calculations will end up wrong.      text    no   The text accompanying the marker image and shown close to the calculated (x, y) position. Default is no text.   Any text     image    no   The image placed at the calculated (x, y) position. Default is Red pog.svg .   Any image     marker_size   marker-size   no   The size (height and width) of the marker image that is placed. Default is 7 pixels wide. If the size is set to 0 , then no image will be shown. It is assumed the shown marker image is a square so the height is equal to its width. If it is not a square you can modify the placement with the x adjust and/or y adjust options.      x_adjust   x-adjust   no   A number of pixels you want the marker image to be moved horizontally after the initial scaling calculation has been done. Use for example if after calculation a rounding error moves the marker image a bit off from its wanted position. Default is 0 .       y_adjust   y-adjust   no   A number of pixels you want the marker image to be moved vertically after the initial scaling calculation has been done. Use for example if the marker image is not a square, or if after calculation a rounding error moves the marker image a bit off from its wanted position. Default is 0 .       x_textadjust   x-textadjust   no   A number of pixels you want the text's upper left corner to be moved horizontally after the initial scaling calculation has been done. Use for example if after calculation a rounding error or the font size moves the text's upper left corner a bit off from its wanted position. If a marker image was shown the default value is 3 pixels to give a little room between the image and the text. Otherwise the default is 0 .       y_textadjust   y-textadjust   no   A number of pixels you want the text's upper left corner to be moved vertically after the initial scaling calculation has been done. Use for example if after calculation a rounding error or the font size moves the text's upper left corner a bit off from its wanted position. Default is 0 .       show_image   showimage show-image   no   If this parameter contains anything else than its default value yes then the marker image will not be shown. Another way to do the same is to set the marker_size to 0 .   Any text or value     text_color   color text-color   no   CSS -option specifying the color of the text accompanying the marker image. This value follows the valid options for specifying a web color with CSS. Default is black .   predefined color name or  or      text_align   text-align   no   CSS -option specifying the alignment of the accompanying marker text. Default value is left .   left , right , center , justify     text_width   text-width   no   CSS -option specifying the column width of the text accompanying the marker image. By default this is not set and follows the browser's calculations. Note that you need to add the units px or % etc, or otherwise the CSS the template generates will be incorrect.   auto , ,     font_size   font-size   no   CSS -option specifying the font size of the text accompanying the marker image. This value follows the valid options for specifying a font size with CSS. Predefined relative font sizes are xx-small , x-small , small , medium , large , x-large , xx-large , or it can be specified with a number in points  pt , pixels  px , ems  em , percent % , cm , etc. By default this is not set and follows the text, font and style around the image.   F.ex. 10 pt , 20 px , 1.5 em , 125 % , …     style    no   Any other CSS you want applied to the text. You need to write this out in full and as valid CSS. This will be applied to the whole text's (rectangle) bounding box, so if you want some CSS applied to only parts of the text you should not use this option, but instead use  some text  on the specific parts of the text itself.   Any valid CSS     See also    , allows text notes to overlap image, allows cropping   , an alternative   - places up to 30 marker images of various chooseable kinds over a base image with optional grid and legend   - places one image over another   - places up to 50 image layers over one another   - places a single image over another at a map coordinate location   , related template to Location map with specific features    "  Category:Graphics templates
