Uniformly convex space

In mathematics, uniformly convex spaces (or uniformly rotund spaces) are common examples of reflexive Banach spaces. The concept of uniform convexity was first introduced by James A. Clarkson in 1936.
Definition
A uniformly convex space is a normed vector space so that, for every 
 
 
 
  there is some 
 
 
 
  so that for any two vectors with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the condition



implies that:



Intuitively, the center of a line segment inside the unit ball must lie deep inside the unit ball unless the segment is short.
Properties

The Milmanâ€“Pettis theorem states that every uniformly convex Banach space is reflexive, while the converse is not true.
If 
 
 
 
  is a sequence in a uniformly convex Banach space which converges weakly to 
 
 
 
  and satisfies 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  converges strongly to 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
 .
A Banach space 
 
 
 
  is uniformly convex if and only if its dual 
 
 
 
  is uniformly smooth.
Every uniformly convex space is strictly convex.

Examples

Every Hilbert space is uniformly convex.
Every closed subspace of a uniformly convex Banach space is uniformly convex.
Hanner's inequalities imply that Lp spaces 
Conversely, 
 
 
 
  is not uniformly convex. For example, in 
 
 
 
  consider 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , but
