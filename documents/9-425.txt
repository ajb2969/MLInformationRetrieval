   Uniformly convex space      Uniformly convex space   In mathematics , uniformly convex spaces (or uniformly rotund spaces ) are common examples of reflexive  Banach spaces . The concept of uniform convexity was first introduced by James A. Clarkson in 1936.  Definition  A uniformly convex space is a normed vector space so that, for every    0  <  ϵ  ≤  2        0  ϵ       2     0<\epsilon\leq 2   there is some    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   so that for any two vectors with     ∥  x  ∥   =  1       norm  x   1    \|x\|=1   and      ∥  y  ∥   =  1   ,       norm  y   1    \|y\|=1,   the condition        ∥    x  +  y   2   ∥   ≥   1  -  δ    .       norm      x  y   2      1  δ     \left\|\frac{x+y}{2}\right\|\geq 1-\delta.     implies that:       ∥   x  -  y   ∥   ≤  ϵ       norm    x  y    ϵ    \|x-y\|\leq\epsilon     Intuitively, the center of a line segment inside the unit ball must lie deep inside the unit ball unless the segment is short.  Properties   The Milman–Pettis theorem states that every uniformly convex Banach space is reflexive , while the converse is not true.  If     {   f  n   }    n  =  1   ∞     superscript   subscript    subscript  f  n      n  1       \{f_{n}\}_{n=1}^{\infty}   is a sequence in a uniformly convex Banach space which converges weakly to   f   f   f   and satisfies      ∥   f  n   ∥   →   ∥  f  ∥    ,     normal-→   norm   subscript  f  n     norm  f     \|f_{n}\|\to\|f\|,   then    f  n     subscript  f  n    f_{n}   converges strongly to   f   f   f   , that is,     ∥    f  n   -  f   ∥   →  0     normal-→   norm     subscript  f  n   f    0    \|f_{n}-f\|\to 0   .  A Banach space   X   X   X   is uniformly convex if and only if its dual    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   is uniformly smooth .  Every uniformly convex space is strictly convex .   Examples   Every Hilbert space is uniformly convex.  Every closed subspace of a uniformly convex Banach space is uniformly convex.  Hanner's inequalities imply that L p spaces  (1 are uniformly convex.  Conversely,    L  ∞     superscript  L     L^{\infty}   is not uniformly convex. For example, in    ℝ  2     superscript  ℝ  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   consider    x  =   (  1  ,  1  )       x   1  1     x=(1,1)   and    y  =   (  0  ,  1  )       y   0  1     y=(0,1)   . Then      ∥  x  ∥   ∞   =    ∥  y  ∥   ∞   =  1         subscript   norm  x      subscript   norm  y          1     \|x\|_{\infty}=\|y\|_{\infty}=1   and      ∥   x  +  y   ∥   ∞   =    ∥   (  1  ,  2  )   ∥   ∞   =  2         subscript   norm    x  y       subscript   norm   1  2           2     \|x+y\|_{\infty}=\|(1,2)\|_{\infty}=2   , but      ∥   x  -  y   ∥   ∞   =    ∥   (  1  ,  0  )   ∥   ∞   =  1         subscript   norm    x  y       subscript   norm   1  0           1     \|x-y\|_{\infty}=\|(1,0)\|_{\infty}=1   .
