   Hat operator      Hat operator   The hat operator is a mathematical notation with various uses in different branches of science and mathematics .  Hat matrix  In statistics, the hat matrix H projects the observed values y of response variable to the predicted values ŷ :        𝐲  ^   =   H  𝐲    .       normal-^  𝐲     H  𝐲     \hat{\mathbf{y}}=H\mathbf{y}.     Cross product  In screw theory , one use of the hat operator is to represent the cross product operation. Since the cross product is a linear transformation , it can be represented as a matrix . The hat operator takes a vector and transforms it into its equivalent matrix.       𝐚  ×  𝐛   =    𝐚  ^   𝐛         𝐚  𝐛      normal-^  𝐚   𝐛     \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}=\mathbf{\hat{a}}\mathbf{b}     For example, in three dimensions,       𝐚  ×  𝐛   =    [      a  x        a  y        a  z      ]   ×   [      b  x        b  y        b  z      ]    =    [     0     -   a  z       a  y        a  z     0     -   a  x         -   a  y       a  x     0     ]    [      b  x        b  y        b  z      ]    =    𝐚  ^   𝐛           𝐚  𝐛        subscript  a  x      subscript  a  y      subscript  a  z        subscript  b  x      subscript  b  y      subscript  b  z               0     subscript  a  z     subscript  a  y      subscript  a  z   0     subscript  a  x         subscript  a  y     subscript  a  x   0       subscript  b  x      subscript  b  y      subscript  b  z              normal-^  𝐚   𝐛      \mathbf{a}\times\mathbf{b}=\begin{bmatrix}a_{x}\\

 a_{z}&0&-a_{x}\\
 -a_{y}&a_{x}&0\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}b_{x}\\
 b_{y}\\
 b_{z}\end{bmatrix}=\mathbf{\hat{a}}\mathbf{b}     Unit Vector  Estimated Value  In statistics , the hat is used to denote an estimator or an estimated value, as opposed to its theoretical counterpart. For example, in the context of errors and residuals , the "hat" over the letter ε indicates an observable estimate (the residuals) of an unobservable quantity called ε (the statistical errors).
