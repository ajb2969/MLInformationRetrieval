Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH)




Trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH)

In enzymology, a trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA + NADPH + H+

 
  acyl-CoA + NADP+


Thus, the three substrates of this enzyme are trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-CoA, NADPH, and H+, whereas its two products are acyl-CoA and NADP+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:NADP+ trans-2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NADPH-dependent trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase, reductase, trans-enoyl coenzyme A, and trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase (NADPH). This enzyme participates in fatty acid elongation in mitochondria and polyunsaturated fatty acid biosynthesis.
Structural studies
