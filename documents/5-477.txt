   Stiefel manifold      Stiefel manifold   In mathematics , the Stiefel manifold  V k ( R n ) is the set of all orthonormal  k -frames in R n . That is, it is the set of ordered k -tuples of orthonormal vectors in R n . It is named after Swiss mathematician Eduard Stiefel . Likewise one can define the complex Stiefel manifold V k ( C n ) of orthonormal k -frames in C n and the quaternionic Stiefel manifold V k ( H n ) of orthonormal k -frames in H n . More generally, the construction applies to any real, complex, or quaternionic inner product space .  In some contexts, a non- compact Stiefel manifold is defined as the set of all linearly independent  k -frames in R n , C n , or H n ; this is homotopy equivalent, as the compact Stiefel manifold is a deformation retract of the non-compact one, by Gram‚ÄìSchmidt . Statements about the non-compact form correspond to those for the compact form, replacing the orthogonal group (or unitary or symplectic group) with the general linear group .  Topology  Let F stand for R , C , or H . The Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) can be thought of as a set of n √ó k  matrices by writing a k -frame as a matrix of k  column vectors in F n . The orthonormality condition is expressed by A * A = 1 where A * denotes the conjugate transpose of A and 1 denotes the k √ó k  identity matrix . We then have         V  k    (   ùîΩ  n   )    =   {   A  ‚àà   ùîΩ   n  √ó  k     :     A  ‚àó   A   =  1   }    .         subscript  V  k    superscript  ùîΩ  n     conditional-set    A   superscript  ùîΩ    n  k          superscript  A  normal-‚àó   A   1      V_{k}(\mathbb{F}^{n})=\left\{A\in\mathbb{F}^{n\times k}:A^{\ast}A=1\right\}.     The topology on V k ( F n ) is the subspace topology inherited from F n √ó k . With this topology V k ( F n ) is a compact  manifold whose dimension is given by       dim    V  k    (   ‚Ñù  n   )     =    n  k   -    1  2   k   (   k  +  1   )          dimension     subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚Ñù  n         n  k       1  2   k    k  1       \dim V_{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n})=nk-\frac{1}{2}k(k+1)          dim    V  k    (   ‚ÑÇ  n   )     =    2  n  k   -   k  2         dimension     subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚ÑÇ  n         2  n  k    superscript  k  2      \dim V_{k}(\mathbb{C}^{n})=2nk-k^{2}           dim    V  k    (   ‚Ñç  n   )     =    4  n  k   -   k   (    2  k   -  1   )      .       dimension     subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚Ñç  n         4  n  k     k      2  k   1       \dim V_{k}(\mathbb{H}^{n})=4nk-k(2k-1).     As a homogeneous space  Each of the Stiefel manifolds V k ( F n ) can be viewed as a homogeneous space for the action of a classical group in a natural manner.  Every orthogonal transformation of a k -frame in R n results in another k -frame, and any two k -frames are related by some orthogonal transformation. In other words, the orthogonal group O( n ) acts transitively on V k ( R n ). The stabilizer subgroup of a given frame is the subgroup isomorphic to O( n ‚àí k ) which acts nontrivially on the orthogonal complement of the space spanned by that frame.  Likewise the unitary group U( n ) acts transitively on V k ( C n ) with stabilizer subgroup U( n ‚àí k ) and the symplectic group Sp( n ) acts transitively on V k ( H n ) with stabilizer subgroup Sp( n ‚àí k ).  In each case V k ( F n ) can be viewed as a homogeneous space:       V  k    (   ‚Ñù  n   )        subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚Ñù  n     \displaystyle V_{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n})     When k = n , the corresponding action is free so that the Stiefel manifold V n ( F n ) is a principal homogeneous space for the corresponding classical group.  When k is strictly less than n then the special orthogonal group SO( n ) also acts transitively on V k ( R n ) with stabilizer subgroup isomorphic to SO( n ‚àí k ) so that          V  k    (   ‚Ñù  n   )    ‚âÖ     SO   (  n  )    /  SO    (   n  -  k   )       for  k   <  n    .     formulae-sequence       subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚Ñù  n          SO  n   SO     n  k         for  k   n     V_{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\cong\mbox{SO}(n)/\mbox{SO}(n-k)\qquad\mbox{for }k   The same holds for the action of the special unitary group on V k ( C n )          V  k    (   ‚ÑÇ  n   )    ‚âÖ     SU   (  n  )    /  SU    (   n  -  k   )       for  k   <  n    .     formulae-sequence       subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚ÑÇ  n          SU  n   SU     n  k         for  k   n     V_{k}(\mathbb{C}^{n})\cong\mbox{SU}(n)/\mbox{SU}(n-k)\qquad\mbox{for }k     Thus for k = n ‚àí¬†1, the Stiefel manifold is a principal homogeneous space for the corresponding special classical group.  Uniform measure  The Stiefel manifold can be equipped with a uniform measure , i.e. a Borel measure that is invariant under the action of the groups noted above. For example, V 1 ( R 2 ), which is isomorphic to the unit circle in the Euclidean plane, has as its uniform measure the obvious uniform measure ( arc length ) on the circle. It is straightforward to sample this measure on V k ( F n ) using Gaussian random matrices : if A ‚àà F n √ó k is a random matrix with independent entries identically distributed according to the standard normal distribution on F , and A = QR is the QR factorization of A , then the matrices Q ‚àà F n √ó k and R ‚àà F k √ó k are independent random variables and Q is distributed according to the uniform measure on V k ( F n ). This result is a consequence of the Bartlett Decomposition Theorem . 1  Special cases      k = 1           V  1    (   ‚Ñù  n   )        =   S   n  -  1           V  1    (   ‚ÑÇ  n   )        =   S    2  n   -  1           V  1    (   ‚Ñç  n   )        =   S    4  n   -  1              subscript  V  1    superscript  ‚Ñù  n      absent   superscript  S    n  1          subscript  V  1    superscript  ‚ÑÇ  n      absent   superscript  S      2  n   1          subscript  V  1    superscript  ‚Ñç  n      absent   superscript  S      4  n   1        \begin{aligned}\displaystyle V_{1}(\mathbb{R}^{n})&\displaystyle=S^{n-1}\\

Given a 2-frame in R n , let the first vector define a point in S n ‚àí1 and the second a unit tangent vector to the sphere at that point. In this way, the Stiefel manifold V 2 ( R n ) may be identified with the unit tangent bundle   When k = n or n ‚àí1 we saw in the previous section that V k ( F n ) is a principal homogeneous space, and therefore diffeomorphic to the corresponding classical group. These are listed in the table at the right.    Functoriality  Given an orthogonal inclusion between vector spaces     X  ‚Ü™  Y   ,     normal-‚Ü™  X  Y    X\hookrightarrow Y,   the image of a set of k orthonormal vectors is orthonormal, so there is an induced closed inclusion of Stiefel manifolds,       V  k    (  X  )    ‚Ü™    V  k    (  Y  )     ,     normal-‚Ü™     subscript  V  k   X      subscript  V  k   Y     V_{k}(X)\hookrightarrow V_{k}(Y),   and this is functorial . More subtly, given an n -dimensional vector space X, the dual basis construction gives a bijection between bases for X and bases for the dual space X * , which is continuous, and thus yields a homeomorphism of top Stiefel manifolds       V  n    (  X  )     ‚Üí  ‚àº     V  n    (   X  *   )     .      superscript  normal-‚Üí  similar-to      subscript  V  n   X      subscript  V  n    superscript  X       V_{n}(X)\stackrel{\sim}{\to}V_{n}(X^{*}).   This is also functorial for isomorphisms of vector spaces.  As a principal bundle  There is a natural projection      p  :     V  k    (   ùîΩ  n   )    ‚Üí    G  k    (   ùîΩ  n   )        normal-:  p   normal-‚Üí     subscript  V  k    superscript  ùîΩ  n       subscript  G  k    superscript  ùîΩ  n       p:V_{k}(\mathbb{F}^{n})\to G_{k}(\mathbb{F}^{n})   from the Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) to the Grassmannian of k -planes in F n which sends a k -frame to the subspace spanned by that frame. The fiber over a given point P in G k ( F n ) is the set of all orthonormal k -frames contained in the space P .  This projection has the structure of a principal G -bundle where G is the associated classical group of degree k . Take the real case for concreteness. There is a natural right action of O( k ) on V k ( R n ) which rotates a k -frame in the space it spans. This action is free but not transitive. The orbits of this action are precisely the orthonormal k -frames spanning a given k -dimensional subspace; that is, they are the fibers of the map p . Similar arguments hold in the complex and quaternionic cases.  We then have a sequence of principal bundles:      O   (  k  )       normal-O  k    \displaystyle\mathrm{O}(k)     The vector bundles  associated to these principal bundles via the natural action of G on F k are just the tautological bundles over the Grassmannians. In other words, the Stiefel manifold V k ( F n ) is the orthogonal, unitary, or symplectic frame bundle associated to the tautological bundle on a Grassmannian.  When one passes to the n ‚Üí ‚àû limit, these bundles become the universal bundles for the classical groups.  Homotopy  The Stiefel manifolds fit into a family of fibrations       V   k  -  1     (   ‚Ñù   n  -  1    )    ‚Üí    V  k    (   ‚Ñù  n   )    ‚Üí   S   n  -  1         normal-‚Üí     subscript  V    k  1     superscript  ‚Ñù    n  1        subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚Ñù  n      normal-‚Üí     superscript  S    n  1       V_{k-1}(\mathbb{R}^{n-1})\to V_{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\to S^{n-1}   , thus the first non-trivial homotopy group of the space V k ( R n ) is in dimension n ‚àí k . Moreover,      œÄ   n  -  k     V  k    (   ‚Ñù  n   )    ‚âÉ  ‚Ñ§     similar-to-or-equals     subscript  œÄ    n  k     subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚Ñù  n    ‚Ñ§    \pi_{n-k}V_{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\simeq\mathbb{Z}   if n ‚àí k ‚àà 2 Z or if k = 1.      œÄ   n  -  k     V  k    (   ‚Ñù  n   )    ‚âÉ   ‚Ñ§  2      similar-to-or-equals     subscript  œÄ    n  k     subscript  V  k    superscript  ‚Ñù  n     subscript  ‚Ñ§  2     \pi_{n-k}V_{k}(\mathbb{R}^{n})\simeq\mathbb{Z}_{2}   if n ‚àí k is odd and k > 1. This result is used in the obstruction-theoretic definition of Stiefel‚ÄìWhitney classes .
