Limit comparison test

In mathematics, the limit comparison test (LCT) (in contrast with the related direct comparison test) is a method of testing for the convergence of an infinite series.
Statement
Suppose that we have two series 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
Then if 
 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  then either both series converge or both series diverge.
Proof
Because 
 
 
 
  we know that for all 
 
 
 
  there is an integer 
 
 
 
  such that for all 
 
 
 
 
  we have that 
 
 
 
 , or what is the same








 
  As 
 
 
 
 
  we can choose 
 
 
 
  to be sufficiently small such that 
 
 
 
  is positive. So 
 
 
 
  and by the direct comparison test, if 
 
 
 
  converges then so does 
 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly 
 
 
 
 , so if 
 
 
 
  converges, again by the direct comparison test, so does 
 
 
 
 .
That is both series converge or both series diverge.
Example
We want to determine if the series 
 
 
 
  converges. For this we compare with the convergent series 
 
 
 
 
 .
As 
 
 
 
  we have that the original series also converges.
One-sided version
One can state a one-sided comparison test by using limit superior. Let 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . Then if 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  converges, necessarily 
 
 
 
  converges.
Example
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all natural numbers 
 
 
 
 
 . Now 
 
 
 
  does not exist, so we cannot apply the standard comparison test. However, 
 
 
 
  and since 
 
 
 
  converges, the one-sided comparison test implies that 
 
 
 
  converges.
Converse of the one-sided comparison test
Let 
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  diverges and 
 
 
 
  converges, then necessarily 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
 
 . The essential content here is that in some sense the numbers 
 
 
 
  are larger than the numbers 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Let 
 
 
 
  be analytic in the unit disc 
 
 
 
  and have image of finite area. By Parseval's formula the area of the image of 
 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . Moreover, 
 
 
 
  diverges. Therefore by the converse of the comparison test, we have 
 
 
 
 , that is, 
 
 
 
 .
