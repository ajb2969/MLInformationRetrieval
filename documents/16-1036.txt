   Coexistence theory      Coexistence theory   (Figure)  Coexistence theory attempts to explain the paradox of the plankton -- how can ecologically similar species coexist without competitively excluding each other?   Coexistence theory is a mathematical model in community ecology that describes how stable communities of multiple species can assemble even among similar species living in similar environments. Coexistence theory explains the stable coexistence of species as an interaction between two opposing forces: fitness differences between species, which should drive the best-adapted species to exclude others within a particular ecological niche , and variation in the environment over an area, which produces multiple niches for species to occupy. In this model, the only way a community can achieve stability is through frequency-dependent population growth, i.e. when all participating species grow at a positive rate when their density is low. In such communities, any species that becomes rare will experience positive growth, pushing its population to recover and making local extinction unlikely.  Types of coexistence mechanisms  Coexistence theory categorizes mechanisms driving coexistence into two main categories: 1   Equalizing mechanisms tend to reduce fitness differences between individuals in a community, reducing the ability of a species to competitively exclude others. For example, only species that can survive in dry environments could possibly survive in a desert; any species ill-adapted to deserts will be entirely excluded by environmental filtering. Fitness differences between desert communities would therefore be lower than expected by chance, which in turn would promote species coexistence: when all species are similarly fit, it becomes harder for any one species to outcompete others.  Stabilizing mechanisms favour the recovery of species from low densities. A community consisting of several species cannot be considered stable unless each species is capable of recovering when rare in the community: otherwise, any chance event that depletes numbers of one species below a recovery threshold would drive it to local extinction, changing the community composition. A general way of measuring the effect of stabilizing mechanisms is by calculating the growth rate of species i in a community as    #:      r  i   ^   =    b  i    (     k  i   -   k  ^    +  A   )         normal-^   subscript  r  i       subscript  b  i        subscript  k  i    normal-^  k    A      \hat{r_{i}}=b_{i}(k_{i}-\hat{k}+A)     #:where:  #:*     r  i   ^     normal-^   subscript  r  i     \hat{r_{i}}   is the growth rate of the species i under consideration,  #:*    b  i     subscript  b  i    b_{i}   is a species-specific factor that describes the relationship between the fitness difference and the growth rate.  #:*     k  i   -   k  ^        subscript  k  i    normal-^  k     k_{i}-\hat{k}   is the difference between the fitness of species i when compared to the average fitness of the community excluding species i . When species i is rare, it will only have a positive growth rate if its fitness is above the community average, i.e. where this value is greater than zero.  #:*   A   A   A   measures the effect of all stabilizing mechanisms acting within this community.  Stabilizing mechanisms  Coexistence theory considers a community to be stable if the species within it can recover from low densities. Chesson proposed three main mechanisms which might stabilize communities in 2000: 2   The storage effect allows a species to "store" the benefits of a productive time period (when thinking temporally) or a productive area (when thinking spatially), and use it to survive during less productive times or in less productive areas. A species at low densities could use these stored resources to grow at a faster rate than species at high densities.  Fitness-density covariance is a special case of the storage effect that results from an uneven distribution of species within a landscape. Areas where a species is particularly fit—for a dry-adapted species, this might be patches of dry scrub in an otherwise wet landscape—will have a high density of the 'fit' species. This high density may itself lower the relative fitness of this species, such as by forcing it to divide limited resources between more individuals, thus further reduce the effective fitness difference between itself and less dense species.  Relative nonlinearity of competition occurs when species benefit in different ways from an increase in resources. For example, two species might coexist if one can outcompete the other when resources are rare, while the other can outcompete the first when resources are abundant. Resources in such a community might be expected to fluctuate between rarity and abundance as populations of these two species alternately rise and fall.   Empirical evidence  A recent review paper 3 reviewed different approaches that tested coexistence theory, and identified three main ways to separate the contributions of stabilizing niche and relative fitness differences within a community. These are:   Experimental manipulations , which involved determining the effect of relative fitness or stabilizing mechanisms by manipulating resources or competitive advantages.  Trait-Phylogeny-Environment relationships , in which, the phylogeny of members of a set of communities can be tested for evidence of trait clustering, which would suggest that certain traits are important (and perhaps necessary) to thrive in that environment, or trait overdispersion, which would suggest a high ability of species to exclude close relatives. Such tests have been widely used, although they have also been criticized as simplistic and flawed. 4  Demographic analyses , which can be used to recognize frequency- or density-dependent processes simply by measuring the number and per-capita growth rates of species in natural communities over time. If such processes are operating, the per-capita growth rate would vary with the number of individuals in species comprising the community.
