2'-N-acetylparomamine deacetylase

2'-N-acetylparomamine deacetylase (, btrD (gene), neoL (gene), kanN (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 2'-N-acetylparomamine hydrolase (acetate-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2'-N-acetylparomamine + H2O $\rightleftharpoons$ paromamine + acetate


This enzyme takes part in the biosynthetic pathways of several clinically important aminocyclitol antibiotics, including kanamycin, butirosin, neomycin and ribostamycin.
