   Nest algebra      Nest algebra   In functional analysis , a branch of mathematics, nest algebras are a class of operator algebras that generalise the upper-triangular matrix algebras to a Hilbert space context. They were introduced by  and have many interesting properties. They are non- selfadjoint algebras, are closed in the weak operator topology and are reflexive .  Nest algebras are among the simplest examples of commutative subspace lattice algebras . Indeed, they are formally defined as the algebra of bounded operators leaving invariant each subspace contained in a subspace nest , that is, a set of subspaces which is totally ordered by inclusion and is also a complete lattice . Since the orthogonal projections corresponding to the subspaces in a nest commute , nests are commutative subspace lattices.  By way of an example, let us apply this definition to recover the finite-dimensional upper-triangular matrices. Let us work in the   n   n   n   - dimensional  complex  vector space     ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   , and let     e  1   ,   e  2   ,  …  ,   e  n       subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2   normal-…   subscript  e  n     e_{1},e_{2},\dots,e_{n}   be the standard basis . For    j  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  n       j   0  1  2  normal-…  n     j=0,1,2,\dots,n   , let    S  j     subscript  S  j    S_{j}   be the   j   j   j   -dimensional subspace of    ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}    spanned by the first   j   j   j   basis vectors     e  1   ,  …  ,   e  j       subscript  e  1   normal-…   subscript  e  j     e_{1},\dots,e_{j}   . Let      N  =   {   (  0  )   =   S  0   ,   S  1   ,   S  2   ,  …  ,   S   n  -  1    ,   S  n   =   ℂ  n   }   ;     fragments  N    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)     subscript  S  0   normal-,   subscript  S  1   normal-,   subscript  S  2   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,   subscript  S    n  1    normal-,   subscript  S  n     superscript  ℂ  n   normal-}   normal-;    N=\{(0)=S_{0},S_{1},S_{2},\dots,S_{n-1},S_{n}=\mathbb{C}^{n}\};     then N is a subspace nest, and the corresponding nest algebra of n × n complex matrices M leaving each subspace in N invariant   that is, satisfying     M  S   ⊆  S        M  S   S    MS\subseteq S   for each S in N – is precisely the set of upper-triangular matrices.  If we omit one or more of the subspaces S j from N then the corresponding nest algebra consists of block upper-triangular matrices.  Properties   Nest algebras are hyperreflexive with distance constant 1.   See also   flag manifold   References     "  Category:Operator theory  Category:Operator algebras
