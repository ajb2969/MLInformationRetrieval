Erythritol kinase




Erythritol kinase

In enzymology, an erythritol kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + erythritol 
 
 
 
  ADP + D-erythritol 4-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and erythritol, whereas its two products are ADP and D-erythritol 4-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:erythritol 4-phosphotransferase. This enzyme is also called erythritol kinase (phosphorylating).
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
