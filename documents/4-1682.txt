   Classification of Clifford algebras      Classification of Clifford algebras   In abstract algebra , in particular in the theory of nondegenerate  quadratic forms on vector spaces , the structures of finite-dimensional  real and complex  Clifford algebras have been completely classified. In each case, the Clifford algebra is algebra isomorphic to a full matrix ring over R , C , or H (the quaternions ), or to a direct sum of two such algebras, though not in a canonical way. Below it is shown that distinct Clifford algebras may be algebra isomorphic, as is the case of Cℓ 2,0 ( R ) and Cℓ 1,1 ( R ) which are both isomorphic to the ring of two-by-two matrices over the real numbers.  Notation and conventions  The Clifford product is the manifest ring product for the Clifford algebra, and all algebra homomorphisms in this article are with respect to this ring product. Other products defined within Clifford algebras, such as the exterior product , are not used here. This article uses the (+) sign convention for Clifford multiplication so that       v  2   =   Q   (  v  )         superscript  v  2     Q  v     v^{2}=Q(v)\,   for all vectors , where Q is the quadratic form on the vector space V . We will denote the algebra of matrices with entries in the division algebra  K by M n ( K ) or M( n , K ). The direct sum of two such identical algebras will be denoted by .  Bott periodicity  Clifford algebras exhibit a 2-fold periodicity over the complex numbers and an 8-fold periodicity over the real numbers, which is related to the same periodicities for homotopy groups of the stable unitary group and stable orthogonal group , and is called Bott periodicity . The connection is explained by the geometric model of loop spaces approach to Bott periodicity: there 2-fold/8-fold periodic embeddings of the classical groups in each other (corresponding to isomorphism groups of Clifford algebras), and their successive quotients are symmetric spaces which are homotopy equivalent to the loop spaces of the unitary/orthogonal group.  Complex case  The complex case is particularly simple: every nondegenerate quadratic form on a complex vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form       Q   (  u  )    =    u  1  2   +   u  2  2   +  ⋯  +   u  n  2          Q  u      superscript   subscript  u  1   2    superscript   subscript  u  2   2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  u  n   2      Q(u)=u_{1}^{2}+u_{2}^{2}+\cdots+u_{n}^{2}   where n = dim V , so there is essentially only one Clifford algebra in each dimension. We will denote the Clifford algebra on C n with the standard quadratic form by Cℓ n ( C ).  There are two separate cases to consider, according to whether n is even or odd. When n is even the algebra Cℓ n ( C ) is central simple and so by the Artin-Wedderburn theorem is isomorphic to a matrix algebra over C . When n is odd, the center includes not only the scalars but the pseudoscalars (degree n elements) as well. We can always find a normalized pseudoscalar ω such that ω 2 = 1. Define the operators        P  ±   =    1  2    (   1  ±  ω   )     .       subscript  P  plus-or-minus       1  2    plus-or-minus  1  ω      P_{\pm}=\frac{1}{2}(1\pm\omega).   These two operators form a complete set of orthogonal idempotents , and since they are central they give a decomposition of Cℓ n ( C ) into a direct sum of two algebras        C    ℓ  n    (  𝐂  )    =     C    ℓ  n  +    (  𝐂  )    ⊕    C    ℓ  n  -    (  𝐂  )           C   subscript  normal-ℓ  n   𝐂    direct-sum    C   superscript   subscript  normal-ℓ  n     𝐂     C   superscript   subscript  normal-ℓ  n     𝐂      C\!\ell_{n}(\mathbf{C})=C\!\ell_{n}^{+}(\mathbf{C})\oplus C\!\ell_{n}^{-}(%
 \mathbf{C})   where      C    ℓ  n  ±    (  𝐂  )    =    P  ±    C    ℓ  n    (  𝐂  )          C   superscript   subscript  normal-ℓ  n   plus-or-minus   𝐂      subscript  P  plus-or-minus   C   subscript  normal-ℓ  n   𝐂     C\!\ell_{n}^{\pm}(\mathbf{C})=P_{\pm}C\!\ell_{n}(\mathbf{C})   . The algebras Cℓ n ± ( C ) are just the positive and negative eigenspaces of ω and the P ± are just the projection operators. Since ω is odd these algebras are mixed by α (the linear map on V defined by ):       α   (    C    ℓ  n  ±    (  𝐂  )    )    =    C    ℓ  n  ∓    (  𝐂  )          α    C   superscript   subscript  normal-ℓ  n   plus-or-minus   𝐂      C   superscript   subscript  normal-ℓ  n   minus-or-plus   𝐂     \alpha(C\!\ell_{n}^{\pm}(\mathbf{C}))=C\!\ell_{n}^{\mp}(\mathbf{C})   . and therefore isomorphic (since α is an automorphism ). These two isomorphic algebras are each central simple and so, again, isomorphic to a matrix algebra over C . The sizes of the matrices can be determined from the fact that the dimension of Cℓ n ( C ) is 2 n . What we have then is the following table:       n   Cℓ n ( C )     2 m   M(2 m , C )     2 m +1   M(2 m , C ) ⊕ M(2 m , C )      The even subalgebra of Cℓ n ( C ) is (non-canonically) isomorphic to Cℓ n −1 ( C ). When n is even, the even subalgebra can be identified with the block diagonal matrices (when partitioned into 2×2 block matrix ). When n is odd, the even subalgebra are those elements of for which the two factors are identical. Picking either piece then gives an isomorphism with .  Real case  The real case is significantly more complicated, exhibiting a periodicity of 8 rather than 2, and there is a 2-parameter family of Clifford algebras.  Classification of quadratic form  Firstly, there are non-isomorphic quadratic forms of a given degree, classified by signature.  Every nondegenerate quadratic form on a real vector space is equivalent to the standard diagonal form:       Q   (  u  )    =     u  1  2   +  ⋯  +   u  p  2    -   u   p  +  1   2   -  ⋯  -   u   p  +  q   2          Q  u        superscript   subscript  u  1   2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  u  p   2     superscript   subscript  u    p  1    2   normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  u    p  q    2      Q(u)=u_{1}^{2}+\cdots+u_{p}^{2}-u_{p+1}^{2}-\cdots-u_{p+q}^{2}   where  is the dimension of the vector space. The pair of integers ( p , q ) is called the signature of the quadratic form. The real vector space with this quadratic form is often denoted R p , q . The Clifford algebra on R p , q is denoted Cℓ p , q ( R ).  A standard orthonormal basis { e i } for R p , q consists of  mutually orthogonal vectors, p of which have norm +1 and q of which have norm −1.  Unit pseudoscalar  The unit pseudoscalar in Cℓ p , q ( R ) is defined as       ω  =    e  1    e  2   ⋯   e  n     .      ω     subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2   normal-⋯   subscript  e  n      \omega=e_{1}e_{2}\cdots e_{n}.   This is both a Coxeter element of sorts (product of reflections) and a longest element of a Coxeter group in the Bruhat order ; this is an analogy. It corresponds to and generalizes a volume form (in the exterior algebra ; for the trivial quadratic form, the unit pseudoscalar is a volume form), and lifts reflection through the origin (meaning that the image of the unit pseudoscalar is reflection through the origin, in the orthogonal group ).  To compute the square     ω  2   =    (    e  1    e  2   ⋯   e  n    )    (    e  1    e  2   ⋯   e  n    )         superscript  ω  2        subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2   normal-⋯   subscript  e  n       subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2   normal-⋯   subscript  e  n       \omega^{2}=(e_{1}e_{2}\cdots e_{n})(e_{1}e_{2}\cdots e_{n})   , one can either reverse the order of the second group, yielding    sgn   (  σ  )    e  1    e  2   ⋯   e  n    e  n   ⋯   e  2    e  1       sgn  σ   subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2   normal-⋯   subscript  e  n    subscript  e  n   normal-⋯   subscript  e  2    subscript  e  1     \mbox{sgn}(\sigma)e_{1}e_{2}\cdots e_{n}e_{n}\cdots e_{2}e_{1}   , or apply a perfect shuffle , yielding    sgn   (  σ  )    (    e  1    e  1    e  2    e  2   ⋯   e  n    e  n    )       sgn  σ     subscript  e  1    subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2    subscript  e  2   normal-⋯   subscript  e  n    subscript  e  n      \mbox{sgn}(\sigma)(e_{1}e_{1}e_{2}e_{2}\cdots e_{n}e_{n})   . These both have sign      (   -  1   )    ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋    =    (   -  1   )     n   (   n  -  1   )    /  2         superscript    1       n  2      superscript    1       n    n  1    2      (-1)^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}=(-1)^{n(n-1)/2}   , which is 4-periodic ( proof ), and combined with      e  i    e  i    =   ±  1          subscript  e  i    subscript  e  i     plus-or-minus  1     e_{i}e_{i}=\pm 1   , this shows that the square of ω is given by       ω  2   =     (   -  1   )     n   (   n  -  1   )    /  2      (   -  1   )   q    =    (   -  1   )      (   p  -  q   )    (   p  -  q  -  1   )    /  2    =   {      +  1       p  -  q   ≡   0  ,   1  mod  4          -  1       p  -  q   ≡   2  ,   3  mod  4.                superscript  ω  2      superscript    1       n    n  1    2     superscript    1   q          superscript    1         p  q     p  q  1    2          cases    1       p  q    0   modulo  1  4       1       p  q    2   modulo  3  4.         \omega^{2}=(-1)^{n(n-1)/2}(-1)^{q}=(-1)^{(p-q)(p-q-1)/2}=\begin{cases}+1&p-q%
 \equiv 0,1\mod{4}\\
 -1&p-q\equiv 2,3\mod{4}.\end{cases}   Note that, unlike the complex case, it is not always possible to find a pseudoscalar which squares to +1.  Center  If n (equivalently, ) is even, the algebra Cℓ p , q ( R ) is central simple and so isomorphic to a matrix algebra over R or H by the Artin–Wedderburn theorem .  If n (equivalently, ) is odd then the algebra is no longer central simple but rather has a center which includes the pseudoscalars as well as the scalars. If n is odd and (equivalently, if ) then, just as in the complex case, the algebra Cℓ p , q ( R ) decomposes into a direct sum of isomorphic algebras       C   ℓ   p  ,  q     (  𝐑  )    =    C   ℓ   p  ,  q   +    (  𝐑  )    ⊕   C   ℓ   p  ,  q   -    (  𝐑  )           C   subscript  normal-ℓ   p  q    𝐑    direct-sum    C   superscript   subscript  normal-ℓ   p  q      𝐑     C   superscript   subscript  normal-ℓ   p  q      𝐑      C\ell_{p,q}(\mathbf{R})=C\ell_{p,q}^{+}(\mathbf{R})\oplus C\ell_{p,q}^{-}(%
 \mathbf{R})   each of which is central simple and so isomorphic to matrix algebra over R or H .  If n is odd and ω 2 = −1 (equivalently, if ) then the center of Cℓ p , q ( R ) is isomorphic to C and can be considered as a complex algebra. As a complex algebra, it is central simple and so isomorphic to a matrix algebra over C .  Classification  All told there are three properties which determine the class of the algebra Cℓ p , q ( R ):   signature mod 2: n is even/odd: central simple or not  signature mod 4: ω 2 = ±1: if not central simple, center is  or C  signature mod 8: the Brauer class of the algebra ( n even) or even subalgebra ( n odd) is R or H   Each of these properties depends only on the signature modulo 8. The complete classification table is given below. The size of the matrices is determined by the requirement that Cℓ p , q ( R ) have dimension 2 p + q .       p − q mod 8   ω 2   Cℓ p , q ( R )  ( n = p + q )   p − q mod 8   ω 2   Cℓ p , q ( R )  ( n = p + q )     0   +   M(2 n /2 , R )   1   +   M(2 ( n −1)/2 , R )⊕M(2 ( n −1)/2 , R )     2   −   M(2 n/2 , R )   3   −   M(2 ( n −1)/2 , C )     4   +   M(2 ( n −2)/2 , H )   5   +   M(2 ( n −3)/2 , H )⊕M(2 ( n −3)/2 , H )     6   −   M(2 ( n −2)/2 , H )   7   −   M(2 ( n −1)/2 , C )       It may be seen that of all matrix ring types mentioned, there is only one type shared between both complex and real algebras: the type M(2 m , C ). For example, Cℓ 2 ( C ) and Cℓ 3,0 ( R ) are both determined to be M 2 ( C ). It is important to note that there is a difference in the classifying isomorphisms used. Since the Cℓ 2 ( C ) is algebra isomorphic via a C -linear map (which is necessarily R -linear), and Cℓ 3,0 ( R ) is algebra isomorphic via an R -linear map, Cℓ 2 ( C ) and Cℓ 3,0 ( R ) are R -algebra isomorphic.  A table of this classification for  follows.

From these Bott periodicity follows:        C   ℓ    p  +  8   ,  q     (  𝐑  )    =   C   ℓ    p  +  4   ,   q  +  4      (  𝐑  )    =    M   2  4     (   C   ℓ   p  ,  q     (  𝐑  )    )     .

(The table is symmetric about columns with signature 1, 5, −3, −7, and so forth.)
