   5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase      5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase   In enzymology , a 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 5-formyltetrahydrofolate (folinic acid)   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically the cyclo-ligases, which form carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclo-ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate synthetase , formyltetrahydrofolic cyclodehydrase , and 5-formyltetrahydrofolate cyclodehydrase . This enzyme participates in one carbon pool by folate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
