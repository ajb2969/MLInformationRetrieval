AGM method

In mathematics, the AGM method (for arithmetic–geometric mean) makes it possible to construct fast algorithms for calculation of exponential and trigonometric functions, and some mathematical constants and in particular, to quickly compute 
 
 
.
Method
Gauss noticed12 that the sequences



as



have the same limit:



the arithmetic–geometric mean.
It is possible to use this fact to construct fast algorithms for calculating elementary transcendental functions and some classical constants, in particular, the constant 

.
Applications
The number π
For example, according to the Gauss–Salamin formula:3



where



which can be computed without loss of precision using



Complete elliptic integral K(α)
At the same time, if we take



then



where K(α) is a complete elliptic integral



Other applications
Using this property of the AGM and also the ascending transformations of Landen,4 Richard Brent5 suggested the first AGM algorithms for fast evaluation of elementary transcendental functions (ex, cos x, sin x). Subsequently, many authors went on to study the use of the AGM algorithms, see, for example, the book Pi and the AGM by Jonathan and Peter Borwein.6
