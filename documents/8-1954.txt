   HisB      HisB   The hisB gene, found in the enterobacteria (such as E. coli ), in Campylobacter jejuni and in Xylella / Xanthomonas encodes a protein involved in catalysis of two step in histidine biosynthesis (the sixth and eight step), namely the bifunctional Imidazoleglycerol-phosphate dehydratase / histidinol-phosphatase . 1  The former function (), found at the N-terminal , dehydrated d -erythroimidazoleglycerolphosphate to imidazoleacetolphosphate, the latter function (), found at the C-terminal , dephosphorylates l -histidinolphosphate producing histidinol. 2 3 4  The firth step is catalysed instead by histadinolphosphate aminotransferase (encoded by hisC ) 5  The peptide is 40.5kDa and associates to form a hexamer (unless truncated) 6  In E. coli hisB is found on the hisGDCBHAFI operon 7  The phosphatase activity possess a substrate ambiguity and overexpression of hisB can rescue phosphoserine phosphatase (serB) knockouts. 8  Reactions  hisB-N   D-erythro-1-(imidazol-4-yl)glycerol 3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-(imidazol-4-yl)-2-oxopropyl phosphate + H 2 O   hisB-C   L-histidinol phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-histidinol + phosphate   Non-fusion protein in other species  HIS3 from Saccharomyces cerevisiae is not a fused IGP dehydratase and hisidinol phosphatase, but an IGPD only (homologous to hisB-N). Whereas HIS2 is the HP (analogous to hisB-C, called hisJ in some prokaryotes).  References  "  Category:Genes     ↩  Parker95: Parker, A.R., Moore, J.A., Schwab, J.M., Davisson, V.J. (1995).
