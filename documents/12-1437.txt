Papyrus 29

Papyrus 29 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 
 
 
29, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Acts of the Apostles, it contains only Acts 26:7-8 and 26:20. The manuscript paleographically has been assigned to the early 3rd century.1
Description
The Greek text of this codex is too short to put in a family. Grenfell and Hunt noticed its agreement with Codex Bezae, 1597, and some Old-Latin manuscripts.2 According to Aland it is a "free text" and it was placed by him in Category I.3 According to Bruce M. Metzger and David Alan Black4 the manuscript might be related to the Western text-type, but Philip Comfort stated "the fragment is too small to be certain of its textual character".5
It is currently housed at the Bodleian Library, Gr. bibl. g. 4 (P) in Oxford.67
