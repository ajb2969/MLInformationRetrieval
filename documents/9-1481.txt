   Woods–Saxon potential      Woods–Saxon potential   (Figure)  Woods–Saxon potential for , relative to V 0 with a    =     =      The Woods–Saxon potential is a mean field  potential for the nucleons ( protons and neutrons ) inside the atomic nucleus , which is used to approximately describe the forces applied on each nucleon , in the shell model for the structure of the nucleus.  The form of the potential, as a function of the distance r from the center of nucleus, is:       V   (  r  )    =   -    V  0    1  +   exp   (    r  -  R   a   )             V  r        subscript  V  0     1        r  R   a         V(r)=-\frac{V_{0}}{1+\exp({r-R\over a})}     where V 0 (having dimension of energy) represents the potential well depth, a is a length representing the "surface thickness" of the nucleus, and    R  =    r  0    A   1  /  3         R     subscript  r  0    superscript  A    1  3       R=r_{0}A^{1/3}   is the nuclear radius where }} and A is the mass number .  Typical values for the parameters are: , .  For large atomic number A this potential is similar to a potential well . It has the following desired properties   It is monotonically increasing with distance, i.e. attracting.  For large A , it is approximately flat in the center.  Nucleons near the surface of the nucleus (i.e. having  within a distance of order a ) experience a large force towards the center.  It rapidly approaches zero as r goes to infinity (), reflecting the short-distance nature of the strong nuclear force .   When using the Schrödinger equation to find the energy levels of nucleons subjected to the Woods–Saxon potential, it cannot be solved analytically , and must be treated numerically.
