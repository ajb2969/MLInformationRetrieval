Milner–Rado paradox

In set theory, a branch of mathematics, the Milner – Rado paradox, found by , states that every ordinal number α less than the successor κ+ of some cardinal number κ can be written as the union of sets X1,X2,... where Xn is of order type at most κn for n a positive integer.
Proof
The proof is by transfinite induction. Let 

 be a limit ordinal (the induction is trivial for successor ordinals), and for each 

, let 

 be a partition of 

 satisfying the requirements of the theorem.
Fix an increasing sequence 
 
 
cofinal in 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
 .
Note 
 
 
 
 .
Define:



Observe that:



and so 

.
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the order type of 

. As for the order types, clearly 
 
 
 
 .
Noting that the sets 
 
 
 
  form a consecutive sequence of ordinal intervals, and that each 
 
 
 
  is a tail segment of 
 
 
 
 
  we get that:
