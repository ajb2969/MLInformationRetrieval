   Partition matroid      Partition matroid   In mathematics, a partition matroid or partitional matroid is a matroid formed from a direct sum of uniform matroids . 1  Definition  Let    B  i     subscript  B  i    B_{i}   be a collection of disjoint sets , and let    d  i     subscript  d  i    d_{i}   be integers with    0  ≤   d  i   ≤   |   B  i   |         0   subscript  d  i           subscript  B  i       0\leq d_{i}\leq|B_{i}|   . Define a set   I   I   I   to be "independent" when, for every index   i   i   i   ,     |   I  ∩   B  i    |   ≤   d  i           I   subscript  B  i      subscript  d  i     |I\cap B_{i}|\leq d_{i}   . Then the sets that are independent sets in this way form the independent sets of a matroid , called a partition matroid. The sets    B  i     subscript  B  i    B_{i}   are called the blocks of the partition matroid. A basis of the matroid is a set whose intersection with every block    B  i     subscript  B  i    B_{i}   has size exactly    d  i     subscript  d  i    d_{i}   , and a circuit of the matroid is a subset of a single block    B  i     subscript  B  i    B_{i}   with size exactly     d  i   +  1       subscript  d  i   1    d_{i}+1   . The rank of the matroid is    ∑   d  i        subscript  d  i     \sum d_{i}   . 2  Every uniform matroid     U    n  r      fragments  U   superscript   subscript  absent  n   r     U{}^{r}_{n}   is a partition matroid, with a single block    B  1     subscript  B  1    B_{1}   of   n   n   n   elements and with     d  1   =  r       subscript  d  1   r    d_{1}=r   . Every partition matroid is the direct sum of a collection of uniform matroids, one for each of its blocks.  In some publications, the notion of a partition matroid is defined more restrictively, with every     d  i   =  1       subscript  d  i   1    d_{i}=1   . The partitions that obey this more restrictive definition are the transversal matroids of the family of disjoint sets given by their blocks. 3  Properties  As with the uniform matroids they are formed from, the dual matroid of a partition matroid is also a partition matroid, and every minor of a partition matroid is also a partition matroid. Direct sums of partition matroids are partition matroids as well.  Matching  A maximum matching in a graph is a set of edges that is as large as possible subject to the condition that no two edges share an endpoint. In a bipartite graph with bipartition    (  U  ,  V  )     U  V    (U,V)   , the sets of edges satisfying the condition that no two edges share an endpoint in   U   U   U   are the independent sets of a partition matroid with one block per vertex in   U   U   U   and with each of the numbers    d  i     subscript  d  i    d_{i}   equal to one. The sets of edges satisfying the condition that no two edges share an endpoint in   V   V   V   are the independent sets of a second partition matroid. Therefore, the bipartite maximum matching problem can be represented as a matroid intersection of these two matroids. 4  More generally the matchings of a graph may be represented as an intersection of two matroids if and only if every odd cycle in the graph is a triangle containing two or more degree-two vertices. 5  Clique complexes  A clique complex is a family of sets of vertices of a graph   G   G   G   that induce complete subgraphs of   G   G   G   . A clique complex forms a matroid if and only if   G   G   G   is a complete multipartite graph , and in this case the resulting matroid is a partition matroid. The clique complexes are exactly the set systems that can be formed as intersections of families of partition matroids for which every     d  i   =  1       subscript  d  i   1    d_{i}=1   . 6  Enumeration  The number of distinct partition matroids that can be defined over a set of   n   n   n   labeled elements, for    n  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …       n   0  1  2  normal-…     n=0,1,2,\dots   , is   1, 2, 5, 16, 62, 276, 1377, 7596, 45789, 298626, 2090910, ... .   The exponential generating function of this sequence is     f   (  x  )    =   exp   (     e  x    (   x  -  1   )    +   2  x   +  1   )          f  x          superscript  e  x     x  1      2  x   1      f(x)=\exp(e^{x}(x-1)+2x+1)   . 7  References  "  Category:Matroid theory  Category:Matching     . ↩  . ↩  E.g., see .  uses the broader definition but notes that the     d  i   =  1       subscript  d  i   1    d_{i}=1   restriction is useful in many applications. ↩  . ↩  . ↩  .
