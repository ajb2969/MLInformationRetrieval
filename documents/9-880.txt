   1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + ⋯      1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + ⋯   In mathematics , the infinite series  1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · · is an example of one of the first infinite series to be summed in the history of mathematics ; it was used by Archimedes circa 250–200 BC. 1 As it is a geometric series with first term 1/4 and common ratio 1/4, its sum is         1  4    1  -   1  4     =   1  3    .          1  4     1    1  4       1  3     \frac{\frac{1}{4}}{1-\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{1}{3}.     Visual demonstrations  The series 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + 1/256 + · · · lends itself to some particularly simple visual demonstrations because a square and a triangle both divide into four similar pieces, each of which contains 1/4 the area of the original.  In the figure on the left, 2 3 if the large square is taken to have area 1, then the largest black square has area (1/2)(1/2) = 1/4. Likewise, the second largest black square has area 1/16, and the third largest black square has area 1/64. The area taken up by all of the black squares together is therefore 1/4 + 1/16 + 1/64 + · · ·, and this is also the area taken up by the gray squares and the white squares. Since these three areas cover the unit square, the figure demonstrates that       3   (    1  4   +   1   4  2    +   1   4  3    +   1   4  4    +  ⋯   )    =  1.        3      1  4     1   superscript  4  2      1   superscript  4  3      1   superscript  4  4    normal-⋯    1.    3\left(\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4^{2}}+\frac{1}{4^{3}}+\frac{1}{4^{4}}+\cdots%
 \right)=1.     Archimedes' own illustration, adapted at top, 4 was slightly different, being closer to the equation  (Figure)  3 s = 1 again         3  4   +   3   4  2    +   3   4  3    +   3   4  4    +  ⋯   =  1.          3  4     3   superscript  4  2      3   superscript  4  3      3   superscript  4  4    normal-⋯   1.    \frac{3}{4}+\frac{3}{4^{2}}+\frac{3}{4^{3}}+\frac{3}{4^{4}}+\cdots=1.   See below for details on Archimedes' interpretation.  The same geometric strategy also works for triangles , as in the figure on the right: 5 6 7 if the large triangle has area 1, then the largest black triangle has area 1/4, and so on. The figure as a whole has a self-similarity between the large triangle and its upper sub-triangle. A related construction making the figure similar to all three of its corner pieces produces the Sierpinski triangle . 8  Proof by Archimedes  (Figure)  This curve is a parabola. The dots on the secant line  AE are equally spaced. Archimedes showed that the sum of the areas of triangles ABC and CDE is 1/4 of the area of triangle ACE . He then constructs another layer of four triangles atop those, the sum of whose areas is 1/4 of the sum of the areas of ABC and CDE , and then another layer of eight triangles atop that, having 1/4 of that area, and so on. He concluded that the area between the secant line and the curve is 4/3 the area of triangle ACE .   Archimedes encounters the series in his work Quadrature of the Parabola . He is finding the area inside a parabola by the method of exhaustion, and he gets a series of triangles; each stage of the construction adds an area 1/4 times the area of the previous stage. His desired result in that the total area is 4/3 the area of the first stage. To get there, he takes a break from parabolas to introduce an algebraic lemma:  Proposition 23. Given a series of areas A , B , C , D , … , Z , of which A is the greatest, and each is equal to four times the next in order, then 9        A  +  B  +  C  +  D  +  ⋯  +  Z  +    1  3   Z    =    4  3   A    .        A  B  C  D  normal-⋯  Z      1  3   Z        4  3   A     A+B+C+D+\cdots+Z+\frac{1}{3}Z=\frac{4}{3}A.     Archimedes proves the proposition by first calculating         B  +  C  +  ⋯  +  Z  +   B  3   +   C  3   +  ⋯  +   Z  3      =       4  B   3   +    4  C   3   +  ⋯  +    4  Z   3         =       1  3    (   A  +  B  +  ⋯  +  Y   )    .           B  C  normal-⋯  Z    B  3     C  3   normal-⋯    Z  3           4  B   3       4  C   3   normal-⋯      4  Z   3       missing-subexpression        1  3     A  B  normal-⋯  Y       \begin{array}[]{rcl}\displaystyle B+C+\cdots+Z+\frac{B}{3}+\frac{C}{3}+\cdots+%
 \frac{Z}{3}&=&\displaystyle\frac{4B}{3}+\frac{4C}{3}+\cdots+\frac{4Z}{3}\\
 &=&\displaystyle\frac{1}{3}(A+B+\cdots+Y).\end{array}   On the other hand,         B  3   +   C  3   +  ⋯  +   Y  3    =    1  3    (   B  +  C  +  ⋯  +  Y   )     .          B  3     C  3   normal-⋯    Y  3        1  3     B  C  normal-⋯  Y      \frac{B}{3}+\frac{C}{3}+\cdots+\frac{Y}{3}=\frac{1}{3}(B+C+\cdots+Y).     Subtracting this equation from the previous equation yields       B  +  C  +  ⋯  +  Z  +   Z  3    =    1  3   A         B  C  normal-⋯  Z    Z  3        1  3   A     B+C+\cdots+Z+\frac{Z}{3}=\frac{1}{3}A   and adding A to both sides gives the desired result. 10  Today, a more standard phrasing of Archimedes' proposition is that the partial sums of the series  are:        1  +   1  4   +   1   4  2    +  ⋯  +   1   4  n     =    1  -    (   1  4   )    n  +  1      1  -   1  4      .        1    1  4     1   superscript  4  2    normal-⋯    1   superscript  4  n         1   superscript    1  4     n  1       1    1  4       1+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4^{2}}+\cdots+\frac{1}{4^{n}}=\frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{4}%
 \right)^{n+1}}{1-\frac{1}{4}}.     This form can be proved by multiplying both sides by 1 − 1/4 and observing that all but the first and the last of the terms on the left-hand side of the equation cancel in pairs. The same strategy works for any finite geometric series .  The limit  Archimedes' Proposition 24 applies the finite (but indeterminate) sum in Proposition 23 to the area inside a parabola by a double reductio ad absurdum . He does not quite 11 take the limit of the above partial sums, but in modern calculus this step is easy enough:         lim   n  →  ∞      1  -    (   1  4   )    n  +  1      1  -   1  4      =   1   1  -   1  4     =   4  3    .          subscript    normal-→  n         1   superscript    1  4     n  1       1    1  4        1    1    1  4            4  3      \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1-\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)^{n+1}}{1-\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{%
 1}{1-\frac{1}{4}}=\frac{4}{3}.     Since the sum of an infinite series is defined as the limit of its partial sums,        1  +   1  4   +   1   4  2    +   1   4  3    +  ⋯   =   4  3    .        1    1  4     1   superscript  4  2      1   superscript  4  3    normal-⋯     4  3     1+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4^{2}}+\frac{1}{4^{3}}+\cdots=\frac{4}{3}.
