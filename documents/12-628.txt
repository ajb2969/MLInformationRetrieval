   Δ13C      Δ13C     In geochemistry , paleoclimatology and paleoceanography  δ 13 C (pronounced "delta thirteen cee") is an isotopic signature , a measure of the ratio of stable isotopes  13 C : 12 C , reported in parts per thousand (per mil, ‰). 1  The definition is, in per mil:       δ  13   C  =   (     (    C    13    C    12    )   sample     (    C    13    C    12    )   standard    -  1  )   *     1000   o      /   o  o        fragments   superscript  δ  13   C    fragments  normal-(     subscript     superscript  normal-C  13    superscript  normal-C  12    sample    subscript     superscript  normal-C  13    superscript  normal-C  12    standard     1  normal-)     superscript  1000  o    subscript     o  o      \mathrm{\delta^{13}C}=\Biggl(\mathrm{\frac{\bigl(\frac{{}^{13}C}{{}^{12}C}%

 *1000\ ^{o}\!/\!_{oo}     where the standard is an established reference material.  δ 13 C varies in time as a function of productivity, organic carbon burial and vegetation type.  Reference standard  The standard established for carbon-13 work was the Pee Dee Belemnite (PDB) and was based on a Cretaceous marine fossil, Belemnitella americana , which was from the Pee Dee Formation in South Carolina . This material had an anomalously high 13 C: 12 C ratio (0.0112372), and was established as δ 13 C value of zero. Use of this standard gives most natural material a negative δ 13 C. 2 A material with a ratio of 0.010743 for example would have a δ 13 C value of (0.010743/0.0112372 − 1)*1000 = −44. The standards are used for verifying the accuracy of mass spectroscopy; as isotope studies became more common, the demand for the standard exhausted the supply. Other standards calibrated to the same ratio, including one known as VPDB (for "Vienna PDB"), have replaced the original. 3  What affects δ 13 C?  Methane has a very light δ 13 C signature: biogenic methane of −60‰ thermogenic methane −40‰. The release of large amounts of methane clathrate can impact on global δ 13 C values, as at the PETM . 4  More commonly, the ratio is affected by variations in primary productivity and organic burial. Organisms preferentially take up light 12 C, and have a δ 13 C signature of about −25‰, depending on their metabolic pathway . Therefore, higher δ 13 C in marine fossils, is indicative of an increase in the abundance of vegetation.  An increase in primary productivity causes a corresponding rise in δ 13 C values as more 12 C is locked up in plants. This signal is also a function of the amount of carbon burial; when organic carbon is buried, more 12 C is locked out of the system in sediments than the background ratio (because organic carbon is lighter).  Geologically significant δ 13 C excursions  C 3 and C 4 plants have different signatures, allowing the importance of C 4 grasses to be detected through time in the δ 13 C record. 5 Whereas  plants have a δ 13 C of −16 to −10 ‰,  plants have a δ 13 C of −33 to −24‰. 6  Mass extinctions are often marked by a negative δ 13 C anomaly thought to represent a decrease in primary productivity and release of plant-based carbon  The evolution of large land plants in the late Devonian led to increased organic carbon burial and consequently a rise in δ 13 C. 7  See also     Isotopic signature  Isotope analysis  Isotope geochemistry  Isotopic labeling   Notes  References     "  Category:Bioindicators  Category:Carbon  Category:Isotopes of carbon  Category:Environmental isotopes  Category:Geochemistry  Category:Paleoclimatology     ↩  http://www.uga.edu/sisbl/stable.html#calib Overview of Stable Isotope Research – The Stable Isotope/Soil Biology Laboratory of the University of Georgia Institute of Ecology ↩  Miller & Wheeler, Biological Oceanography , p. 186. ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  http://www.lpi.usra.edu/meetings/impact2000/pdf/3072.pdf ↩
