   Banach limit      Banach limit   In mathematical analysis , a Banach limit is a continuous  linear functional     ϕ  :    ℓ  ∞   →  ℂ      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→   superscript  normal-ℓ    ℂ     \phi:\ell^{\infty}\to\mathbb{C}   defined on the Banach space     ℓ  ∞     superscript  normal-ℓ     \ell^{\infty}   of all bounded complex -valued sequences such that for all sequences    x  =   (   x  n   )       x   subscript  x  n     x=(x_{n})   ,    y  =   (   y  n   )       y   subscript  y  n     y=(y_{n})   in    ℓ  ∞     superscript  normal-ℓ     \ell^{\infty}   , and complex numbers   α   α   \alpha   :        ϕ   (    α  x   +  y   )    =    α  ϕ   (  x  )    +   ϕ   (  y  )           ϕ      α  x   y        α  ϕ  x     ϕ  y      \phi(\alpha x+y)=\alpha\phi(x)+\phi(y)   (linearity);  if     x  n   ≥  0       subscript  x  n   0    x_{n}\geq 0   for all    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   , then     ϕ   (  x  )    ≥  0        ϕ  x   0    \phi(x)\geq 0   (positivity);       ϕ   (  x  )    =   ϕ   (   S  x   )          ϕ  x     ϕ    S  x      \phi(x)=\phi(Sx)   , where   S   S   S   is the shift operator defined by      (   S  x   )   n   =   x   n  +  1         subscript    S  x   n    subscript  x    n  1      (Sx)_{n}=x_{n+1}   (shift-invariance);  if   x   x   x   is a convergent sequence , then     ϕ   (  x  )    =   lim  x         ϕ  x     x     \phi(x)=\lim x   .   Hence,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is an extension of the continuous functional     lim  x   :   c  ↦  ℂ      normal-:    x    maps-to  c  ℂ     \lim x:c\mapsto\mathbb{C}   where    c  ⊂   ℓ  ∞       c   superscript  normal-ℓ      c\subset\ell^{\infty}   is the complex vector space of all sequences with converge to a (usual) limit in   ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   .  In other words, a Banach limit extends the usual limits, is linear, shift-invariant and positive. However, there exist sequences for which the values of two Banach limits do not agree. We say that the Banach limit is not uniquely determined in this case.  As a consequence of the above properties, a Banach limit also satisfies:        lim inf   n  →  ∞     x  n    ≤   ϕ   (  x  )    ≤    lim sup   n  →  ∞     x  n            subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n      subscript  x  n      ϕ  x          subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n      subscript  x  n       \liminf_{n\to\infty}x_{n}\leq\phi(x)\leq\limsup_{n\to\infty}x_{n}     The existence of Banach limits is usually proved using the Hahn–Banach theorem (analyst's approach), or using ultrafilters (this approach is more frequent in set-theoretical expositions). These proofs necessarily use the Axiom of choice (so called non-effective proof).  Almost convergence  There are non-convergent sequences which have a uniquely determined Banach limit. For example, if    x  =   (  1  ,  0  ,  1  ,  0  ,  …  )       x   1  0  1  0  normal-…     x=(1,0,1,0,\ldots)   , then     x  +   S   (  x  )     =   (  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  …  )         x    S  x     1  1  1  normal-…     x+S(x)=(1,1,1,\ldots)   is a constant sequence, and       2  ϕ   (  x  )    =    ϕ   (  x  )    +   ϕ   (   S  x   )     =   ϕ   (   x  +   S  x    )    =   ϕ   (   (  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  …  )   )    =   lim   (   (  1  ,  1  ,  1  ,  …  )   )    =  1          2  ϕ  x       ϕ  x     ϕ    S  x            ϕ    x    S  x            ϕ   1  1  1  normal-…            1  1  1  normal-…         1     2\phi(x)=\phi(x)+\phi(Sx)=\phi(x+Sx)=\phi((1,1,1,\ldots))=\lim((1,1,1,\ldots))=1     holds. Thus, for any Banach limit, this sequence has limit    1  /  2      1  2    1/2   .  A bounded sequence   x   x   x   with the property, that for every Banach limit   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   the value    ϕ   (  x  )       ϕ  x    \phi(x)   is the same, is called almost convergent .  Ba spaces  Given a convergent sequence    x  =   (   x  n   )       x   subscript  x  n     x=(x_{n})   in    c  ⊂   ℓ  ∞       c   superscript  normal-ℓ      c\subset\ell^{\infty}   , the ordinary limit of   x   x   x   does not arise from an element of    ℓ  1     superscript  normal-ℓ  1    \ell^{1}   , if the duality    <   ℓ  1   ,   ℓ  ∞   >     fragments    superscript  normal-ℓ  1   normal-,   superscript  normal-ℓ       {<}\ell^{1},\ell^{\infty}{>}   is considered. The latter means    ℓ  ∞     superscript  normal-ℓ     \ell^{\infty}   is the continuous dual space (dual Banach space) of    ℓ  1     superscript  normal-ℓ  1    \ell^{1}   , and consequently,    ℓ  1     superscript  normal-ℓ  1    \ell^{1}   induces continuous linear functionals on    ℓ  ∞     superscript  normal-ℓ     \ell^{\infty}   , but not all. Any Banach limit on    ℓ  ∞     superscript  normal-ℓ     \ell^{\infty}   is an example of an element of the dual Banach space of    ℓ  ∞     superscript  normal-ℓ     \ell^{\infty}   which is not in    ℓ  1     superscript  normal-ℓ  1    \ell^{1}   . The dual of    ℓ  ∞     superscript  normal-ℓ     \ell^{\infty}   is known as the ba space , and consists of all (signed) finitely additive measures on the sigma-algebra of all subsets of the natural numbers, or equivalently, all (signed) Borel measures on the Stone–Čech compactification of the natural numbers.
