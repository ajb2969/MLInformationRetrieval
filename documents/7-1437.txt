CAIDI

The Customer Average Interruption Duration Index (CAIDI) is a reliability index commonly used by electric power utilities.1 It is related to SAIDI and SAIFI, and is calculated as



where 
 
 
 
  is the failure rate, 
 
 
 
  is the number of customers, and 
 
 
 
  is the annual outage time for location 
 
 
 
 . In other words,



CAIDI gives the average outage duration that any given customer would experience. CAIDI can also be viewed as the average restoration time.
CAIDI is measured in units of time, often minutes or hours. It is usually measured over the course of a year, and according to IEEE Standard 1366-1998 the median value for North American utilities is approximately 1.36 hours.
