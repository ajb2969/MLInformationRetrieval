If     p   (  z  )    =     a  n    z  n    +    a   n  -  1     z   n  -  1     +  ⋯  +    a  2    z  2    +    a  1   z   +   a  0    =  0          p  z        subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n       subscript  a    n  1     superscript  z    n  1     normal-⋯     subscript  a  2    superscript  z  2       subscript  a  1   z    subscript  a  0         0     p(z)=a_{n}z^{n}+a_{n-1}z^{n-1}+\cdots+a_{2}z^{2}+a_{1}z+a_{0}=0   , then   z   z   z   is called a zero of    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   . If   z   z   z   is real, then   z   z   z   is a real zero of    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   ; if   z   z   z   is imaginary, the   z   z   z   is a complex zero of    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   , although complex zeros include both real and imaginary zeros.  The fundamental theorem of algebra states that every polynomial function of degree    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   has at least one complex zero. It follows that every polynomial function of degree    n  ≥  1      n  1    n\geq 1   has exactly   n   n   n   complex zeros, not necessarily distinct.   If the degree of the polynomial function is 1, i.e.,     p   (  x  )    =     a  1   x   +   a  0          p  x        subscript  a  1   x    subscript  a  0      p(x)=a_{1}x+a_{0}   , then its (only) zero is     -   a  0     a  1          subscript  a  0     subscript  a  1     \frac{-a_{0}}{a_{1}}   .  If the degree of the polynomial function is 2, i.e.,     p   (  x  )    =     a  2    x  2    +    a  1   x   +   a  0          p  x        subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2       subscript  a  1   x    subscript  a  0      p(x)=a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}   , then its two zeros (not necessarily distinct) are      -   a  1    +     a  1    2   -   4   a  2    a  0        2   a  2             subscript  a  1         superscript   subscript  a  1   2     4   subscript  a  2    subscript  a  0         2   subscript  a  2      \frac{-a_{1}+\sqrt{{a_{1}}^{2}-4a_{2}a_{0}}}{2a_{2}}   and      -   a  1    -     a  1    2   -   4   a  2    a  0        2   a  2             subscript  a  1         superscript   subscript  a  1   2     4   subscript  a  2    subscript  a  0         2   subscript  a  2      \frac{-a_{1}-\sqrt{{a_{1}}^{2}-4a_{2}a_{0}}}{2a_{2}}   .   A degree one polynomial is also known as a linear function , whereas a degree two polynomial is also known as a quadratic function and its two zeros are merely a direct result of the quadratic formula . However, difficulty rises when the degree of the polynomial, n , is higher than 2. There is a cubic formula for a cubic function (a degree three polynomial) and there is a quartic formula for a quartic function (a degree four polynomial), but they are very complicated. There is no general formula for a polynomial function of degree 5 or higher (see Abel–Ruffini theorem ).  The theorems  Remainder theorem  The remainder theorem states that if    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   is divided by    x  -  c      x  c    x-c   , then the remainder is    p   (  c  )       p  c    p(c)   .  For example, when     p   (  x  )    =     x  3   +   2  x    -  3         p  x        superscript  x  3     2  x    3     p(x)=x^{3}+2x-3   is divided by    x  -  2      x  2    x-2   , the remainder (if we do not care about the quotient) will be     p   (  2  )    =     2  3   +   2   (  2  )     -  3   =  9          p  2        superscript  2  3     2  2    3        9     p(2)=2^{3}+2(2)-3=9   . When    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   is divided by    x  +  1      x  1    x+1   , the remainder is     p   (   -  1   )    =      (   -  1   )   3   +   2   (   -  1   )     -  3   =   -  6           p    1         superscript    1   3     2    1     3          6      p(-1)=(-1)^{3}+2(-1)-3=-6   . However, this theorem is most useful when the remainder is 0 since it will yield a zero of    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   . For example,    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   is divided by    x  -  1      x  1    x-1   , the remainder is     p   (  1  )    =      (  1  )   3   +   2   (  1  )     -  3   =  0          p  1        superscript  1  3     2  1    3        0     p(1)=(1)^{3}+2(1)-3=0   , so 1 is a zero of    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   (by the definition of zero of a polynomial function).  de:Nullstelle "  Category:Theorems in complex analysis
