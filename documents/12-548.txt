Sion's minimax theorem

In mathematics, and in particular game theory, Sion's minimax theorem is a generalization of John von Neumann's minimax theorem, named after Maurice Sion.
It states:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a compact convex subset of a linear topological space and 
 
 
 
  a convex subset of a linear topological space. If 
 
 
 
  is a real-valued function on 
 
 
 
  with


upper semicontinuous and quasiconcave on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  lower semicontinuous and quasi-convex on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 

then,
