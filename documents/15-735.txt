   Skorokhod problem      Skorokhod problem   In probability theory , a the Skorokhod problem is the problem of solving a stochastic differential equation with a reflecting boundary condition. 1  The problem is named after Anatoliy Skorokhod who first published the solution to a stochastic differential equation for a reflecting Brownian motion . 2 3 4  Problem statement  The classic version of the problem states 5 that given a càdlàg process { X ( t ), t ≥ 0} and an M-matrix  R , then stochastic processes { W ( t ), t ≥ 0} and { Z ( t ), t ≥ 0} are said to solve the Skorokhod problem if for all non-negative t values,   W ( t ) = X ( t ) + R Z ( t ) ≥ 0  Z (0) = 0 and d Z ( t ) ≥ 0        ∫  0  t     W  i    (  s  )   d   Z  i    (  s  )     =  0        superscript   subscript   0   t      subscript  W  i   s  d   subscript  Z  i   s    0    \int_{0}^{t}W_{i}(s)\text{d}Z_{i}(s)=0   .   The matrix R is often known as the reflection matrix, W ( t ) as the reflected process and Z ( t ) as the regulator process.  References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
