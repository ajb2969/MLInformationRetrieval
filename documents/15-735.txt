Skorokhod problem

In probability theory, a the Skorokhod problem is the problem of solving a stochastic differential equation with a reflecting boundary condition.1
The problem is named after Anatoliy Skorokhod who first published the solution to a stochastic differential equation for a reflecting Brownian motion.234
Problem statement
The classic version of the problem states5 that given a càdlàg process {X(t), t ≥ 0} and an M-matrix R, then stochastic processes {W(t), t ≥ 0} and {Z(t), t ≥ 0} are said to solve the Skorokhod problem if for all non-negative t values,

W(t) = X(t) + R Z(t) ≥ 0
Z(0) = 0 and dZ(t) ≥ 0


 
 .

The matrix R is often known as the reflection matrix, W(t) as the reflected process and Z(t) as the regulator process.
