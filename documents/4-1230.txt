   Principal branch      Principal branch   In mathematics , a principal branch is a function which selects one branch ("slice") of a multi-valued function . Most often, this applies to functions defined on the complex plane .  Examples  (Figure)  Principal branch of arg(z)   Trigonometric inverses  Principal branches are used in the definition of many inverse trigonometric functions , such as the selection either to define that or that .  Exponentiation to fractional powers  A more familiar principal branch function, limited to real numbers, is that of a positive real number raised to the power of    1  /  2      1  2    1/2   .  For example, take the relation  x 1/2 }} , where   x   x   x   is any positive real number.  This relation can be satisfied by any value of   y   y   y   equal to a square root of   x   x   x   (either positive or negative). By convention,    x      x    \sqrt{x}   is used to denote the positive square root of   x   x   x   .  In this instance, the positive square root function is taken as the principal branch of the multi-valued relation .  Complex logarithms  One way to view a principal branch is to look specifically at the exponential function , and the logarithm , as it is defined in complex analysis .  The exponential function is single-valued, where is defined as:       e  z   =     e  a    cos  b    +   i   e  a    sin  b          superscript  e  z        superscript  e  a     b      i   superscript  e  a     b       e^{z}=e^{a}\cos b+ie^{a}\sin b   where    z  =   a  +   i  b        z    a    i  b      z=a+ib   .  However, the periodic nature of the trigonometric functions involved makes it clear that the logarithm is not so uniquely determined. One way to see this is to look at the following:       Re   (   log  z   )    =   log     a  2   +   b  2           Re    z           superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2        \operatorname{Re}(\log z)=\log\sqrt{a^{2}+b^{2}}     and       Im   (   log  z   )    =    atan2   (  b  ,  a  )    +   2  π  k         Im    z       atan2  b  a     2  π  k      \operatorname{Im}(\log z)=\operatorname{atan2}(b,a)+2\pi k   where   k   k   k   is any integer and    a  t  a  n  2      a  t  a  n  2    atan2   is arctangent with the appropriate sign correction .  Any number    l  o  g  z      l  o  g  z    logz   defined by such criteria has the property that  z }} .  In this manner log function is a multi-valued function (often referred to as a "multifunction" in the context of complex analysis). A branch cut, usually along the negative real axis, can limit the imaginary part so it lies between    −  π      normal-−  π    −π   and   π   π   π   . These are the chosen principal values .  This is the principal branch of the log function. Often it is defined using a capital letter,    L  o  g  z      L  o  g  z    Logz   .
