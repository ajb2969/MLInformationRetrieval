Softening

Softening is a numerical trick used in N-body techniques to prevent numerical divergences when a particle comes too close to another (and the force goes to infinity). This is obtained by modifying the gravitational potential of each particle as



where 
 
 
 
  is the softening parameter. The value of the softening parameter should be set small enough to keep simulations realistic.
