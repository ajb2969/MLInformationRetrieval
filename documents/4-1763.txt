   Softening      Softening   Softening is a numerical trick used in N-body techniques to prevent numerical divergences when a particle comes too close to another (and the force goes to infinity). This is obtained by modifying the gravitational potential of each particle as       Φ  =   -   1     r  2   +   ϵ  2        ,      normal-Φ      1       superscript  r  2    superscript  ϵ  2         \Phi=-\frac{1}{\sqrt{r^{2}+\epsilon^{2}}},     where   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is the softening parameter. The value of the softening parameter should be set small enough to keep simulations realistic.  "  Category:Computational physics
