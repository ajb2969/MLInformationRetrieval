   Sigma-ideal      Sigma-ideal   In mathematics , particularly measure theory , a σ -ideal of a sigma-algebra ( σ , read "sigma," means countable in this context) is a subset with certain desirable closure properties. It is a special type of ideal . Its most frequent application is perhaps in probability theory .  Let ( X ,Σ) be a measurable space (meaning Σ is a σ -algebra of subsets of X ). A subset N of Σ is a σ -ideal if the following properties are satisfied:  (i) Ø ∈ N ;  (ii) When A ∈ N and B ∈ Σ , B ⊆ A ⇒ B ∈ N ;  (iii)       {   A  n   }    n  ∈  ℕ    ⊆  N  ⇒    ⋃   n  ∈  ℕ     A  n    ∈  N   .         subscript    subscript  A  n      n  ℕ    N    normal-⇒      subscript     n  ℕ     subscript  A  n         N     \left\{A_{n}\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\subseteq N\Rightarrow\bigcup_{n\in%
 \mathbb{N}}A_{n}\in N.     Briefly, a sigma-ideal must contain the empty set and contain subsets and countable unions of its elements. The concept of σ -ideal is dual to that of a countably  complete ( σ -) filter .  If a measure  μ is given on ( X ,Σ), the set of μ - negligible sets ( S ∈ Σ such that μ ( S ) = 0 ) is a σ -ideal.  The notion can be generalized to preorders ( P ,≤,0) with a bottom element 0 as follows: I is a σ -ideal of P just when  (i') 0 ∈ I ,  (ii') x ≤ y & y ∈ I ⇒ x ∈ I , and  (iii') given a family x n ∈ I ( n ∈ N ), there is y ∈ I such that x n ≤ y for each n  Thus I contains the bottom element, is downward closed, and is closed under countable  suprema (which must exist). It is natural in this context to ask that P itself have countable suprema.  References   Bauer, Heinz (2001): Measure and Integration Theory . Walter de Gruyter GmbH & Co.
