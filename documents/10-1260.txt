   Aldehyde dehydrogenase (FAD-independent)      Aldehyde dehydrogenase (FAD-independent)   In enzymology , an aldehyde dehydrogenase (FAD-independent) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aldehyde + H 2 O + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a carboxylate + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are aldehyde , H 2 O , and acceptor , whereas its two products are carboxylate and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aldehyde:acceptor oxidoreductase (FAD-independent) . Other names in common use include aldehyde oxidase , aldehyde oxidoreductase , Mop , and AORDd .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
