   Limaçon trisectrix      Limaçon trisectrix   (Figure)  Limaçon Trisectrix   In geometry , a limaçon trisectrix (called simply a trisectrix by some authors) is a member of the Limaçon family of curves which has the trisectrix , or angle trisection , property. It can be defined as locus of the point of intersection of two lines, each rotating at a uniform rate about separate points, so that the ratio of the rates of rotation is 2:3 and the lines initially coincide with the line between the two points. Thus, it is an example of a sectrix of Maclaurin .  Equations  If the first line is rotating about the origin, forming angle θ with the x -axis, and the second line is rotating about the point ( a , 0) with angle 3θ/2, then the angle between them is θ/2 and the law of sines can be used to determine the distance from the point of intersection to the origin as      r  =   a    sin    3  2   θ     sin    1  2   θ      =   a   (    3    cos  2      1  2    θ     -    sin  2      1  2    θ     )    =   a   (   1  +   2   cos  θ     )          r    a          3  2   θ          1  2   θ             a      3    superscript   2       1  2   θ       superscript   2       1  2   θ             a    1    2    θ         r=a\frac{\sin\tfrac{3}{2}\theta}{\sin\tfrac{1}{2}\theta}=a(3\cos^{2}\tfrac{1}{%
 2}\theta-\sin^{2}\tfrac{1}{2}\theta)=a(1+2\cos\theta)   . This is the equation with polar coordinates , showing that the curve is a Limaçon. The curve crosses itself at the origin, the rightmost point of the outer loop is at (3 a , 0) and the tip of the inner loop is at ( a , 0).  If the curve is shifted so that the origin is at the tip of the inner loop then the equation becomes      r  =   2  a   cos   θ  3         r    2  a      θ  3       r=2a\cos{\theta\over 3}   so it is also in the rose family of curves.  The trisection property  There are several ways to use the curve to trisect an angle. Let φ be the angle to be trisected. First, draw a ray from the tip of the small loop at ( a , 0) with angle φ with the x -axis. Let P be the point where the ray intersects the curve, assumed to be on the outer loop if φ is small. Draw another ray from the origin to P . Then the angle between the two rays at P trisects φ. This follows easily from the construction of the curve given above.  For the second method, draw a circle of radius a and center at the origin. Draw a ray from the origin with angle φ with the x -axis. Let S be the point where this ray intersects the circle and draw the line from S to ( a , 0). Let J be the point where this line intersects the curve, assumed to be on the inner loop if φ is small. The line from the origin to J has angle φ/3 with the x -axis.  By rotating the curve, the second form of the equation becomes      r  =   a   sin   θ  3         r    a      θ  3       r=a\sin{\theta\over 3}   . So if a right triangle is constructed with side r and hypotenuse a then the angle between them will be θ/3. It is straightforward to generate a third method from this.
