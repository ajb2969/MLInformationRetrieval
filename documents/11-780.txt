   Protein-arginine deiminase      Protein-arginine deiminase   In enzymology , a protein-arginine deiminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes a form of post translational modification called arginine de-imination or citrullination :   protein L-arginine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   protein L-citrulline + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are protein L-arginine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are protein L-citrulline and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is protein-L-arginine iminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called peptidylarginine deiminase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
