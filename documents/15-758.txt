Hua's identity

In algebra, Hua's identity1 states that for any elements a, b in a division ring,


 
  whenever 
 
 
 
 . Replacing 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  gives another equivalent form of the identity:



An important application of the identity is a proof of Hua's theorem.23 The theorem says that if 
 
 
 
  is a function between division rings and if 
 
 
 
  satisfies:


 
  then 
 
 
 
  is either a homomorphism or an antihomomorphism. The theorem is important because of the connection to the fundamental theorem of projective geometry.
Proof
