Partial geometry

An incidence structure

 
  consists of points 
 
 
 
 , lines 
 
 
 
 , and flags 
 
 
 
  where a point 
 
 
 
  is said to be incident with a line 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 . It is a (finite) partial geometry if there are integers

 
  such that:

For any pair of distinct points 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , there is at most one line incident with both of them.
Each line is incident with 
 
 
 
  points.
Each point is incident with 
 
 
 
  lines.
If a point 
 
 
 
  and a line 
 
 
 
  are not incident, there are exactly 
 
 
 
  pairs 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  is incident with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is incident with 
 
 
 
 .

A partial geometry with these parameters is denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
Properties

The number of points is given by 
 
 
 
  and the number of lines by 
 
 
 
 .
The point graph of a 
 
 
 
  is a strongly regular graph

 
 .
Partial geometries are dual structures : the dual of a 
 
 
 
  is simply a 
 
 
 
 .

Special case

The generalized quadrangles are exactly those partial geometries 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
The Steiner systems are precisely those partial geometries 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
