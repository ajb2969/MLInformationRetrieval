   Partial geometry      Partial geometry   An incidence structure     C  =   (  P  ,  L  ,  I  )       C   P  L  I     C=(P,L,I)   consists of points   P   P   P   , lines   L   L   L   , and flags    I  ⊆   P  ×  L       I    P  L     I\subseteq P\times L   where a point   p   p   p   is said to be incident with a line   l   l   l   if     (  p  ,  l  )   ∈  I       p  l   I    (p,l)\in I   . It is a ( finite ) partial geometry if there are integers      s  ,  t  ,  α   ≥  1       s  t  α   1    s,t,\alpha\geq 1   such that:   For any pair of distinct points   p   p   p   and   q   q   q   , there is at most one line incident with both of them.  Each line is incident with    s  +  1      s  1    s+1   points.  Each point is incident with    t  +  1      t  1    t+1   lines.  If a point   p   p   p   and a line   l   l   l   are not incident, there are exactly   α   α   \alpha   pairs     (  q  ,  m  )   ∈  I       q  m   I    (q,m)\in I   , such that   p   p   p   is incident with   m   m   m   and   q   q   q   is incident with   l   l   l   .   A partial geometry with these parameters is denoted by    p  g   (  s  ,  t  ,  α  )       p  g   s  t  α     pg(s,t,\alpha)   .  Properties   The number of points is given by      (   s  +  1   )    (    s  t   +  α   )    α          s  1       s  t   α    α    \frac{(s+1)(st+\alpha)}{\alpha}   and the number of lines by      (   t  +  1   )    (    s  t   +  α   )    α          t  1       s  t   α    α    \frac{(t+1)(st+\alpha)}{\alpha}   .  The point graph of a    p  g   (  s  ,  t  ,  α  )       p  g   s  t  α     pg(s,t,\alpha)   is a strongly regular graph     s  r  g   (    (   s  +  1   )     (    s  t   +  α   )   α    ,   s   (   t  +  1   )    ,    s  -  1   +   t   (   α  -  1   )     ,   α   (   t  +  1   )    )       s  r  g       s  1         s  t   α   α      s    t  1        s  1     t    α  1       α    t  1       srg((s+1)\frac{(st+\alpha)}{\alpha},s(t+1),s-1+t(\alpha-1),\alpha(t+1))   .  Partial geometries are dual structures : the dual of a    p  g   (  s  ,  t  ,  α  )       p  g   s  t  α     pg(s,t,\alpha)   is simply a    p  g   (  t  ,  s  ,  α  )       p  g   t  s  α     pg(t,s,\alpha)   .   Special case   The generalized quadrangles are exactly those partial geometries    p  g   (  s  ,  t  ,  α  )       p  g   s  t  α     pg(s,t,\alpha)   with    α  =  1      α  1    \alpha=1   .  The Steiner systems are precisely those partial geometries    p  g   (  s  ,  t  ,  α  )       p  g   s  t  α     pg(s,t,\alpha)   with    α  =   s  +  1       α    s  1     \alpha=s+1   .
