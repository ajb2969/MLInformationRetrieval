It is named for the mathematician Eduard Čech .  Motivation  Let X be a topological space, and let   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   be an open cover of X . Define a simplicial complex     N   (  𝒰  )       N  𝒰    N(\mathcal{U})   , called the nerve of the covering, as follows:   There is one vertex for each element of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   .  There is one edge for each pair      U  1   ,   U  2    ∈  𝒰        subscript  U  1    subscript  U  2    𝒰    U_{1},U_{2}\in\mathcal{U}   such that      U  1   ∩   U  2    ≠  ∅         subscript  U  1    subscript  U  2       U_{1}\cap U_{2}\neq\emptyset   .  In general, there is one k -simplex for each k+1 -element subset    {   U  0   ,  …  ,   U  k   }      subscript  U  0   normal-…   subscript  U  k     \{U_{0},\ldots,U_{k}\}\,\!   of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   for which      U  0   ∩  ⋯  ∩   U  k    ≠  ∅         subscript  U  0   normal-⋯   subscript  U  k       U_{0}\cap\cdots\cap U_{k}\neq\emptyset\,\!   .   Geometrically, the nerve    N   (  𝒰  )       N  𝒰    N(\mathcal{U})   is essentially a "dual complex" (in the sense of a dual graph , or Poincaré duality ) for the covering   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   .  The idea of Čech cohomology is that, if we choose a "nice" cover   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   consisting of sufficiently small open sets, the resulting simplicial complex    N   (  𝒰  )       N  𝒰    N(\mathcal{U})   should be a good combinatorial model for the space X . For such a cover, the Čech cohomology of X is defined to be the simplicial  cohomology of the nerve.  This idea can be formalized by the notion of a good cover , for which every open set and every finite intersection of open sets is contractible . However, a more general approach is to take the direct limit of the cohomology groups of the nerve over the system of all possible open covers of X , ordered by refinement . This is the approach adopted below.  Construction  Let   X   X   X   be a topological space , and let   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   be a presheaf of abelian groups on   X   X   X   . Let   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   be an open cover of   X   X   X   .  Simplex  A q - simplex    σ   σ   \sigma   of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   is an ordered collection of    q  +  1      q  1    q+1   sets chosen from   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   , such that the intersection of all these sets is non-empty. This intersection is called the support of   σ   σ   \sigma   and is denoted    |  σ  |      σ    |\sigma|   .  Now let    σ  =    (   U  i   )    i  ∈   {  0  ,  …  ,  q  }         σ   subscript   subscript  U  i     i   0  normal-…  q       \sigma=(U_{i})_{i\in\{0,\ldots,q\}}   be such a q -simplex. The j-th partial boundary of   σ   σ   \sigma   is defined to be the (q-1) -simplex obtained by removing the j -th set from   σ   σ   \sigma   , that is:         ∂  j   σ   :=    (   U  i   )    i  ∈    {  0  ,  …  ,  q  }   ∖   {  j  }       .     assign    subscript   j   σ    subscript   subscript  U  i     i     0  normal-…  q    j        \partial_{j}\sigma:=(U_{i})_{i\in\{0,\ldots,q\}\setminus\{j\}}.   The boundary of   σ   σ   \sigma   is defined as the alternating sum of the partial boundaries:        ∂  σ   :=    ∑   j  =  0   q      (   -  1   )    j  +  1      ∂  j   σ      .     assign    σ     superscript   subscript     j  0    q      superscript    1     j  1      subscript   j   σ       \partial\sigma:=\sum_{j=0}^{q}(-1)^{j+1}\partial_{j}\sigma.     Cochain  A q - cochain of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   with coefficients in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is a map which associates to each q -simplex σ an element of    ℱ   (   |  σ  |   )       ℱ    σ     \mathcal{F}(|\sigma|)   and we denote the set of all q -cochains of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   with coefficients in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   by     C  q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )        superscript  C  q    𝒰  ℱ     C^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})   .     C  q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )        superscript  C  q    𝒰  ℱ     C^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})   is an abelian group by pointwise addition.  Differential  The cochain groups can be made into a cochain complex     (    C  .    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    ,  δ  )        superscript  C  .    𝒰  ℱ    δ    (C^{\textbf{.}}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F}),\delta)   by defining the coboundary operator      δ  q   :     C  q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    →    C   q  +  1     (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )        normal-:   subscript  δ  q    normal-→     superscript  C  q    𝒰  ℱ       superscript  C    q  1     𝒰  ℱ       \delta_{q}:C^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})\to C^{q+1}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})   by        (    δ  q   ω   )    (  σ  )    :=    ∑   j  =  0    q  +  1       (   -  1   )   j    res   |  σ  |    |    ∂  j   σ   |    ω   (    ∂  j   σ   )        assign       subscript  δ  q   ω   σ     superscript   subscript     j  0      q  1       superscript    1   j    subscript   superscript  res      subscript   j   σ       σ    ω    subscript   j   σ       \quad(\delta_{q}\omega)(\sigma):=\sum_{j=0}^{q+1}(-1)^{j}\mathrm{res}^{|%
 \partial_{j}\sigma|}_{|\sigma|}\omega(\partial_{j}\sigma)   ,  where    res   |  σ  |    |    ∂  j   σ   |      subscript   superscript  res      subscript   j   σ       σ     \mathrm{res}^{|\partial_{j}\sigma|}_{|\sigma|}   is the restriction morphism     ℱ   (   |    ∂  j   σ   |   )       ℱ      subscript   j   σ      \mathcal{F}(|\partial_{j}\sigma|)   to     ℱ   (   |  σ  |   )    .      ℱ    σ     \mathcal{F}(|\sigma|).     A calculation shows that      δ   q  +  1    ∘   δ  q    =  0         subscript  δ    q  1     subscript  δ  q    0    \delta_{q+1}\circ\delta_{q}=0   .  The coboundary operator is also sometimes called the codifferential .  Cocycle  A q -cochain is called a q -cocycle if it is in the kernel of δ, hence      Z  q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    :=   ker   (    δ  q   :     C  q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    →    C   q  +  1     (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )      )       assign     superscript  Z  q    𝒰  ℱ     kernel   normal-:   subscript  δ  q    normal-→     superscript  C  q    𝒰  ℱ       superscript  C    q  1     𝒰  ℱ         Z^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F}):=\ker\left(\delta_{q}:C^{q}(\mathcal{U},%
 \mathcal{F})\to C^{q+1}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})\right)   is the set of all q -cocycles.  Thus a (q-1)-cochain f is a cocycle if for all q -simplices σ the cocycle condition      ∑   j  =  0    q  -  1       (   -  1   )   j    res   |  σ  |    |    ∂  j   σ   |    f   (    ∂  j   σ   )     =  0        superscript   subscript     j  0      q  1       superscript    1   j    subscript   superscript  res      subscript   j   σ       σ    f    subscript   j   σ     0    \sum_{j=0}^{q-1}(-1)^{j}\mathrm{res}^{|\partial_{j}\sigma|}_{|\sigma|}f(%
 \partial_{j}\sigma)=0   holds. In particular, a 1-cochain f is a 1-cocycle if          ∀    {  A  ,  B  ,  C  }   ⊂  𝒰     U   :=   A  ∩  B  ∩  C    ,        f   (   B  ∩  C   )    |   U   -     f   (   A  ∩  C   )    |   U    +     f   (   A  ∩  B   )    |   U    =  0.      formulae-sequence   assign    subscript  for-all     A  B  C   𝒰    U     A  B  C           evaluated-at    f    B  C    U    evaluated-at    f    A  C    U     evaluated-at    f    A  B    U    0.     \forall_{\{A,B,C\}\subset\mathcal{U}}\ U:=A\cap B\cap C,\ f(B\cap C)|_{U}-f(A%
 \cap C)|_{U}+f(A\cap B)|_{U}=0.     Coboundary  A q -cochain is called a q -coboundary if it is in the image of δ and     B  q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )   :=  im   (   δ   q  -  1    :   C   q  -  1     (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )   →   C  q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )   )      fragments   superscript  B  q    fragments  normal-(  U  normal-,  F  normal-)   assign  im   fragments  normal-(   subscript  δ    q  1    normal-:   superscript  C    q  1     fragments  normal-(  U  normal-,  F  normal-)   normal-→   superscript  C  q    fragments  normal-(  U  normal-,  F  normal-)   normal-)     B^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F}):=\mathrm{im}\left(\delta_{q-1}:C^{q-1}(\mathcal%
 {U},\mathcal{F})\to C^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})\right)   is the set of all q -coboundaries.  For example, a 1-cochain f is a 1-coboundary if there exists a 0-cochain h such that        ∀    {  A  ,  B  }   ⊂  𝒰    ,  U   :=   A  ∩  B    ,    f   (  U  )    =    (   δ  h   )    (  U  )    =      h   (  A  )    |   U   -     h   (  B  )    |   U      .     formulae-sequence   assign    subscript  for-all     A  B   𝒰    U     A  B          f  U       δ  h   U           evaluated-at    h  A   U    evaluated-at    h  B   U        \forall_{\{A,B\}\subset\mathcal{U}},U:=A\cap B,f(U)=(\delta h)(U)=h(A)|_{U}-h(%
 B)|_{U}.     Cohomology  The Čech cohomology of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   with values in   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is defined to be the cohomology of the cochain complex    (    C  .    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    ,  δ  )        superscript  C  .    𝒰  ℱ    δ    (C^{\textbf{.}}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F}),\delta)   . Thus the q th Čech cohomology is given by         H  ˇ   q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    :=    H  q    (   (    C  .    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    ,  δ  )   )    =      Z  q    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    /   B  q     (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )         assign     superscript   normal-ˇ  H   q    𝒰  ℱ       superscript  H  q       superscript  C  .    𝒰  ℱ    δ                superscript  Z  q    𝒰  ℱ     superscript  B  q     𝒰  ℱ       \check{H}^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F}):=H^{q}((C^{\textbf{.}}(\mathcal{U},%
 \mathcal{F}),\delta))=Z^{q}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})/B^{q}(\mathcal{U},%
 \mathcal{F})   .  The Čech cohomology of X is defined by considering refinements of open covers. If   𝒱   𝒱   \mathcal{V}   is a refinement of   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   then there is a map in cohomology        H  ˇ   *    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )    →     H  ˇ   *    (  𝒱  ,  ℱ  )     .     normal-→     superscript   normal-ˇ  H      𝒰  ℱ       superscript   normal-ˇ  H      𝒱  ℱ      \check{H}^{*}(\mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})\to\check{H}^{*}(\mathcal{V},\mathcal{F}).   The open covers of X form a directed set under refinement, so the above map leads to a direct system of abelian groups. The Čech cohomology of X with values in    ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}    is defined as the direct limit       H  ˇ    (  X  ,  ℱ  )    :=     lim  →   𝒰     H  ˇ    (  𝒰  ,  ℱ  )        assign     normal-ˇ  H    X  ℱ      subscript  injective-limit  𝒰      normal-ˇ  H    𝒰  ℱ       \check{H}(X,\mathcal{F}):=\underrightarrow{\lim}_{\mathcal{U}}\check{H}(%
 \mathcal{U},\mathcal{F})   of this system.  The Čech cohomology of X with coefficients in a fixed abelian group A , denoted     H  ˇ    (  X  ;  A  )        normal-ˇ  H    X  A     \check{H}(X;A)   , is defined as     H  ˇ    (  X  ,   ℱ  A   )        normal-ˇ  H    X   subscript  ℱ  A      \check{H}(X,\mathcal{F}_{A})   where    ℱ  A     subscript  ℱ  A    \mathcal{F}_{A}   is the constant sheaf on X determined by A .  A variant of Čech cohomology, called numerable Čech cohomology , is defined as above, except that all open covers considered are required to be numerable : that is, there is a partition of unity {ρ i } such that each support    {   x   |    ρ  i    (  x  )    >   0   }       x   ket     subscript  ρ  i   x    0     \{x|\rho_{i}(x)>0\}   is contained in some element of the cover. If X is paracompact and Hausdorff , then numerable Čech cohomology agrees with the usual Čech cohomology.  Relation to other cohomology theories  If X is homotopy equivalent to a CW complex , then the Čech cohomology      H  ˇ   *    (  X  ;  A  )        superscript   normal-ˇ  H      X  A     \check{H}^{*}(X;A)   is naturally isomorphic to the singular cohomology      H  *    (  X  ;  A  )        superscript  H     X  A     H^{*}(X;A)\,   . If X is a differentiable manifold , then      H  ˇ   *    (  X  ;  ℝ  )        superscript   normal-ˇ  H      X  ℝ     \check{H}^{*}(X;\mathbb{R})   is also naturally isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology ; the article on de Rham cohomology provides a brief review of this isomorphism. For less well-behaved spaces, Čech cohomology differs from singular cohomology. For example if X is the closed topologist's sine curve , then        H  ˇ   1    (  X  ;  ℤ  )    =  ℤ   ,         superscript   normal-ˇ  H   1    X  ℤ    ℤ    \check{H}^{1}(X;\mathbb{Z})=\mathbb{Z},   whereas      H  1    (  X  ;  ℤ  )    =  0.         superscript  H  1    X  ℤ    0.    H^{1}(X;\mathbb{Z})=0.     If X is a differentiable manifold and the cover   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   of X is a "good cover" ( i.e. all the sets U α are contractible to a point, and all finite intersections of sets in   𝒰   𝒰   \mathcal{U}   are either empty or contractible to a point), then      H  ˇ   *    (  𝒰  ;  ℝ  )        superscript   normal-ˇ  H      𝒰  ℝ     \check{H}^{*}(\mathcal{U};\mathbb{R})   is isomorphic to the de Rham cohomology.  If X is compact Hausdorff, then Čech cohomology (with coefficients in a discrete group) is isomorphic to Alexander-Spanier cohomology .  In algebraic geometry  Čech cohomology can be defined more generally for objects in a site  C endowed with a topology. This applies, for example, to the Zariski site or the etale site of a scheme  X . The Čech cohomology with values in some sheaf  F is defined as          H  ˇ   n    (  X  ,  F  )    :=     lim  →   𝒰      H  ˇ   n    (  𝒰  ,  F  )      .     assign     superscript   normal-ˇ  H   n    X  F      subscript  injective-limit  𝒰      superscript   normal-ˇ  H   n    𝒰  F       \check{H}^{n}(X,F):=\underrightarrow{\lim}_{\mathcal{U}}\check{H}^{n}(\mathcal%
 {U},F).   where the colimit runs over all coverings (with respect to the chosen topology) of X . Here      H  ˇ   n    (  𝒰  ,  F  )        superscript   normal-ˇ  H   n    𝒰  F     \check{H}^{n}(\mathcal{U},F)   is defined as above, except that the r -fold intersections of open subsets inside the ambient topological space are replaced by the r -fold fiber product        𝒰   ×  X  r    :=   𝒰   ×  X   …   ×  X   𝒰    .     assign   superscript  𝒰   subscript   superscript   r   X      subscript   X   𝒰  normal-…  𝒰     \mathcal{U}^{\times^{r}_{X}}:=\mathcal{U}\times_{X}\dots\times_{X}\mathcal{U}.     As in the classical situation of topological spaces, there is always a map        H  n    (  X  ,  F  )    →     H  ˇ   n    (  X  ,  F  )       normal-→     superscript  H  n    X  F       superscript   normal-ˇ  H   n    X  F      H^{n}(X,F)\rightarrow\check{H}^{n}(X,F)   from sheaf cohomology to Čech cohomology. It is always an isomorphism in degrees n = 0 and 1, but may fail to be so in general. For the Zariski topology on a Noetherian  separated scheme , Čech and sheaf cohomology agree for any quasi-coherent sheaf . For the etale topology , the two cohomologies agree for any sheaf, provided that any finite set of points in the base scheme X are contained in some open affine subscheme. This is satisfied, for example, if X is quasi-projective over an affine scheme . 2  The possible difference between Cech cohomology and sheaf cohomology is a motivation for the use of hypercoverings : these are more general objects than the Cech nerve         N  X   𝒰   :   …  →   𝒰   ×  X   𝒰   ×  X   𝒰   →   𝒰   ×  X   𝒰   →  𝒰    .     normal-:     subscript  N  X   𝒰      normal-→  normal-…    subscript   X   𝒰  𝒰  𝒰     normal-→      subscript   X   𝒰  𝒰     normal-→    𝒰      N_{X}\mathcal{U}:\dots\rightarrow\mathcal{U}\times_{X}\mathcal{U}\times_{X}%
 \mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{U}\times_{X}\mathcal{U}\rightarrow\mathcal{U}.   A hypercovering K ∗ of X is a simplicial object in C , i.e., a collection of objects K n together with boundary and degeneracy maps. Applying a sheaf F to K ∗ yields a simplicial abelian group  F ( K ∗ ) whose n -th cohomology group is denoted H n ( F ( K ∗ )). (This group is the same as      H  ˇ   n    (  𝒰  ,  F  )        superscript   normal-ˇ  H   n    𝒰  F     \check{H}^{n}(\mathcal{U},F)   in case K equals     N  X   𝒰       subscript  N  X   𝒰    N_{X}\mathcal{U}   .) Then, it can be shown that there is a canonical isomorphism         H  n    (  X  ,  F  )    =     lim  →    K  *      H  n    (   F   (   K  *   )    )      ,         superscript  H  n    X  F      subscript  injective-limit   subscript  K        superscript  H  n     F   subscript  K         H^{n}(X,F)=\underrightarrow{\lim}_{K_{*}}H^{n}(F(K_{*})),   where the colimit now runs over all hypercoverings. 3  References        ISBN 0-387-90419-0.
