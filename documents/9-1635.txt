   Containment order      Containment order   In the mathematical field of order theory , a containment order is the partial order that arises as the subset -containment relation on some collection of objects. In a simple way, every poset  P = (≤, X ) is ( isomorphic to) a containment order (just as every group is isomorphic to a permutation group - see Cayley's theorem ). To see this, associate to each element x of X the set         X  ≤    (  x  )    =   {   y  ∈  X   |   y  ≤  x   }    ;         subscript  X    x    conditional-set    y  X     y  x      X_{\leq}(x)=\{y\in X|y\leq x\};     then the transitivity of ≤ ensures that for all a and b in X , we have         X  ≤    (  a  )    ⊆    X  ≤    (  b  )   precisely when  a   ≤  b   .           subscript  X    a      subscript  X    b  precisely when  a        b     X_{\leq}(a)\subseteq X_{\leq}(b)\mbox{ precisely when }a\leq b.     There can be sets   S   S   S   of cardinality less than    |  X  |      X    |X|   such that P is isomorphic to the containment order on S. The size of the smallest possible S is called the 2-dimension of S .  Several important classes of poset arise as containment orders for some natural collections, like the Boolean lattice  Q n , which is the collection of all 2 n subsets of an n -element set, the interval-containment orders , which are precisely the orders of order dimension at most two, and the dimension- n orders, which are the containment orders on collections of n -boxes anchored at the origin . Other containment orders that are interesting in their own right include the circle orders , which arise from disks in the plane, and the angle orders .
