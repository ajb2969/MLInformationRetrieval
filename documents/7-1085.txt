In complex analysis, a branch of mathematics, a holomorphic function is said to be of exponential type C if its growth is bounded by the exponential function eC|z| for some constant C as |z|→∞. When a function is bounded in this way, it is then possible to express it as certain kinds of convergent summations over a series of other complex functions, as well as understanding when it is possible to apply techniques such as Borel summation, or, for example, to apply the Mellin transform, or to perform approximations using the Euler-MacLaurin formula. The general case is handled by Nachbin's theorem, which defines the analogous notion of Ψ-type for a general function Ψ(z) as opposed to ez.
Basic idea
A function f(z) defined on the complex plane is said to be of exponential type if there exist constants M and τ such that



in the limit of 
 
 
 
 . Here, the complex variable z was written as 
 
 
 
  to emphasize that the limit must hold in all directions θ. Letting τ stand for the infimum of all such τ, one then says that the function f is of exponential type τ.
For example, let 
 
 
 
 . Then one says that 
 
 
 
  is of exponential type π, since π is the smallest number that bounds the growth of 
 
 
 
  along the imaginary axis. So, for this example, Carlson's theorem cannot apply, as it requires functions of exponential type less than π. Similarly, the Euler-MacLaurin formula cannot be applied either, as it, too, expresses an theorem ultimately anchored in the theory of finite differences.
Formal definition
A holomorphic function

Exponential type with respect to a symmetric convex body

Fréchet space
Collections of functions of exponential type 
 
 
 
  can form a complete uniform space, namely a Fréchet space, by the topology induced by the countable family of norms
$$\|f\|_{n} = \sup_{z \in \mathbb{C}} \exp \left[-\left(\tau + \frac{1}{n}\right)|z|\right]|f(z)|$$
