   Exponential type      Exponential type   (Figure)  The graph of the function in gray is    e   -   π   z  2        superscript  e      π   superscript  z  2       e^{-\pi z^{2}}   , the Gaussian restricted to the real axis. The Gaussian does not have exponential type, but the functions in red and blue are one sided approximations that have exponential type    2  π      2  π    2\pi   .   In complex analysis , a branch of mathematics , a holomorphic function is said to be of exponential type C if its growth is bounded by the exponential function  e C|z| for some constant C as | z |→∞. When a function is bounded in this way, it is then possible to express it as certain kinds of convergent summations over a series of other complex functions, as well as understanding when it is possible to apply techniques such as Borel summation , or, for example, to apply the Mellin transform , or to perform approximations using the Euler-MacLaurin formula . The general case is handled by Nachbin's theorem , which defines the analogous notion of Ψ-type for a general function Ψ(z) as opposed to e z .  Basic idea  A function f ( z ) defined on the complex plane is said to be of exponential type if there exist constants M and τ such that       |   f   (   r   e   i  θ     )    |   ≤   M   e   τ  r             f    r   superscript  e    i  θ         M   superscript  e    τ  r       |f(re^{i\theta})|\leq Me^{\tau r}     in the limit of    r  →  ∞     normal-→  r     r\to\infty   . Here, the complex variable  z was written as    z  =   r   e   i  θ         z    r   superscript  e    i  θ       z=re^{i\theta}   to emphasize that the limit must hold in all directions θ. Letting τ stand for the infimum of all such τ, one then says that the function f is of exponential type τ .  For example, let     f   (  z  )    =   sin   (   π  z   )          f  z       π  z      f(z)=\sin(\pi z)   . Then one says that    sin   (   π  z   )         π  z     \sin(\pi z)   is of exponential type π, since π is the smallest number that bounds the growth of    sin   (   π  z   )         π  z     \sin(\pi z)   along the imaginary axis. So, for this example, Carlson's theorem cannot apply, as it requires functions of exponential type less than π. Similarly, the Euler-MacLaurin formula cannot be applied either, as it, too, expresses an theorem ultimately anchored in the theory of finite differences .  Formal definition  A holomorphic function     F   (  z  )       F  z    F(z)   is said to be of exponential type     σ  >  0      σ  0    \sigma>0   if for every    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   there exists a constant    A  ε     subscript  A  ε    A_{\varepsilon}   such that       |   F   (  z  )    |   ≤    A  ε    e    (   σ  +  ε   )    |  z  |              F  z       subscript  A  ε    superscript  e      σ  ε     z        |F(z)|\leq A_{\varepsilon}e^{(\sigma+\varepsilon)|z|}     for     |  z  |   →  ∞     normal-→    z      |z|\to\infty   where    z  ∈  ℂ      z  ℂ    z\in\mathbb{C}   . We say    F   (  z  )       F  z    F(z)   is of exponential type if    F   (  z  )       F  z    F(z)   is of exponential type   σ   σ   \sigma   for some    σ  >  0      σ  0    \sigma>0   . The number       τ   (  F  )    =  σ  =    lim sup    |  z  |   →  ∞       |  z  |    -  1     log   |   F   (  z  )    |              τ  F   σ         subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→    z         superscript    z     1          F  z          \tau(F)=\sigma=\displaystyle\limsup_{|z|\rightarrow\infty}|z|^{-1}\log|F(z)|     is the exponential type of    F   (  z  )       F  z    F(z)   .  Exponential type with respect to a symmetric convex body  has given a generalization of exponential type for entire functions of several complex variables . Suppose   K   K   K   is a convex , compact , and symmetric subset of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . It is known that for every such   K   K   K   there is an associated norm     ∥  ⋅   ∥  K      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to  K     \|\cdot\|_{K}   with the property that      K  =   {   x  ∈   ℝ  n    :     ∥  x  ∥   K   ≤  1   }       K   conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  n       subscript   norm  x   K   1      K=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:\|x\|_{K}\leq 1\}   . In other words,   K   K   K   is the unit ball in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   with respect to    ∥  ⋅   ∥  K      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to  K     \|\cdot\|_{K}   . The set       K  *   =   {   y  ∈   ℝ  n    :    x  ⋅  y   ≤   1  for all  x   ∈  K   }        superscript  K     conditional-set    y   superscript  ℝ  n         normal-⋅  x  y     1  for all  x        K       K^{*}=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{n}:x\cdot y\leq 1\text{ for all }x\in{K}\}   is called the polar set and is also a convex , compact , and symmetric subset of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . Furthermore, we can write        ∥  x  ∥   K   =    sup   y  ∈   K  *      |   x  ⋅  y   |         subscript   norm  x   K     subscript  supremum    y   superscript  K         normal-⋅  x  y       \|x\|_{K}=\displaystyle\sup_{y\in K^{*}}|x\cdot y|   .  We extend    ∥  ⋅   ∥  K      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to  K     \|\cdot\|_{K}   from    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   to    ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   by         ∥  z  ∥   K   =    sup   y  ∈   K  *      |   z  ⋅  y   |     .       subscript   norm  z   K     subscript  supremum    y   superscript  K         normal-⋅  z  y       \|z\|_{K}=\displaystyle\sup_{y\in K^{*}}|z\cdot y|.     An entire function    F   (  z  )       F  z    F(z)   of   n   n   n   -complex variables is said to be of exponential type with respect to   K   K   K   if for every    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   there exists a constant    A  ε     subscript  A  ε    A_{\varepsilon}   such that     τ   τ   \tau   .
