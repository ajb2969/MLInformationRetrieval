   Affine group      Affine group   In mathematics , the affine group or general affine group of any affine space over a field  K is the group of all invertible affine transformations from the space into itself.  It is a Lie group if K is the real or complex field or quaternions .  Relation to general linear group  Construction from general linear group  Concretely, given a vector space V, it has an underlying affine space  A obtained by ‚Äúforgetting‚Äù the origin, with V acting by translations, and the affine group of A can be described concretely as the semidirect product of V by GL( V ), the general linear group of V :       Aff   (  A  )    =   V  ‚ãä   GL   (  V  )          Aff  A    right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  V   GL  V      \operatorname{Aff}(A)=V\rtimes\operatorname{GL}(V)   The action of GL( V ) on V is the natural one (linear transformations are automorphisms), so this defines a semidirect product.  In terms of matrices, one writes:       Aff   (  n  ,  K  )    =    K  n   ‚ãä   GL   (  n  ,  K  )          Aff  n  K    right-normal-factor-semidirect-product   superscript  K  n    GL  n  K      \operatorname{Aff}(n,K)=K^{n}\rtimes\operatorname{GL}(n,K)   where here the natural action of GL( n , K ) on K n is matrix multiplication of a vector.  Stabilizer of a point  Given the affine group of an affine space A , the stabilizer of a point p is isomorphic to the general linear group of the same dimension (so the stabilizer of a point in Aff(2, R ) is isomorphic to GL(2, R )); formally, it is the general linear group of the vector space    (  A  ,  p  )     A  p    (A,p)   : recall that if one fixes a point, an affine space becomes a vector space.  All these subgroups are conjugate, where conjugation is given by translation from p to q (which is uniquely defined), however, no particular subgroup is a natural choice, since no point is special ‚Äì this corresponds to the multiple choices of transverse subgroup, or splitting of the short exact sequence      1  ‚Üí  V  ‚Üí   V  ‚ãä   GL   (  V  )     ‚Üí   GL   (  V  )    ‚Üí  1       normal-‚Üí  1  V    normal-‚Üí     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  V   GL  V      normal-‚Üí     GL  V     normal-‚Üí    1     1\to V\to V\rtimes\operatorname{GL}(V)\to\operatorname{GL}(V)\to 1   .  In the case that the affine group was constructed by starting with a vector space, the subgroup that stabilizes the origin (of the vector space) is the original GL( V ).  Matrix representation  Representing the affine group as a semidirect product of V by GL( V ), then by construction of the semidirect product , the elements are pairs ( M , v ), where v is a vector in V and M is a linear transform in GL( V ), and multiplication is given by:         (  M  ,  v  )   ‚ãÖ   (  N  ,  w  )    =   (   M  N   ,   v  +   M  w    )    .       normal-‚ãÖ   M  v    N  w       M  N     v    M  w       (M,v)\cdot(N,w)=(MN,v+Mw).\,     This can be represented as the ( n +¬†1)√ó( n +¬†1) block matrix :      (     M    v      0    1     )      M  v    0  1     \left(\begin{array}[]{c|c}M&v;\\
 \hline 0&1\end{array}\right)     where M is an n √ó n matrix over K , v an n √ó¬†1 column vector, 0 is a 1¬†√ó n row of zeros, and 1 is the 1¬†√ó¬†1 identity block matrix.  Formally, Aff( V ) is naturally isomorphic to a subgroup of    GL   (   V  ‚äï  K   )      GL   direct-sum  V  K     \operatorname{GL}(V\oplus K)   , with V embedded as the affine plane    {   (  v  ,  1  )   |   v  ‚àà  V   }     conditional-set   v  1     v  V     \{(v,1)|v\in V\}   , namely the stabilizer of this affine plane; the above matrix formulation is the (transpose of) the realization of this, with the ( n √ó n and 1¬†√ó¬†1) blocks corresponding to the direct sum decomposition    V  ‚äï  K     direct-sum  V  K    V\oplus K   .  A similar representation is any ( n +¬†1)√ó( n +¬†1) matrix in which the entries in each column sum to 1. 1 The similarity  P for passing from the above kind to this kind is the ( n +¬†1)√ó( n +¬†1) identity matrix with the bottom row replaced by a row of all ones.  Each of these two classes of matrices is closed under matrix multiplication.  Planar affine group  According to Artzy , 2 "The linear part of each affinity [of the real affine plane] can be brought into one of the following standard forms by a coordinate transformation followed by a dilation from the origin:         x  ‚Ü¶    a  x   +   b  y     ,    y  ‚Ü¶     -   b  x    +   a  y    ,  a    ,    b  ‚â†  0   ,     a  2   +   b  2    =  1      ,     formulae-sequence   maps-to  x      a  x     b  y      formulae-sequence   maps-to  y         b  x      a  y    a     formulae-sequence    b  0        superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    1       x\mapsto ax+by,\quad y\mapsto-bx+ay,\quad a,b\neq 0,\quad a^{2}+b^{2}=1,           x  ‚Ü¶   x  +   b  y     ,    y  ‚Ü¶  y   ,   b  ‚â†  0     ,     formulae-sequence   maps-to  x    x    b  y      formulae-sequence   maps-to  y  y     b  0      x\mapsto x+by,\quad y\mapsto y,\quad b\neq 0,           x  ‚Ü¶   a  x    ,    y  ‚Ü¶   y  /  a    ,   a  ‚â†  0     ,     formulae-sequence   maps-to  x    a  x     formulae-sequence   maps-to  y    y  a      a  0      x\mapsto ax,\quad y\mapsto y/a,\quad a\neq 0,   where the coefficients a, b, c , and d are real numbers."   Case (1) corresponds to similarity transformations which generate a subgroup of similarities. Euclidean geometry corresponds to the subgroup of congruencies. It is characterized by Euclidean distance or angle , which are invariant under the subgroup of rotations.  Case (2) corresponds to shear mappings . An important application is absolute time and space where Galilean transformations relate frames of reference. They generate the Galilean group.  Case (3) corresponds to squeeze mapping . These transformations generate a subgroup, of the planar affine group, called the Lorentz group of the plane. The geometry associated with this group is characterized by hyperbolic angle , which is a measure that is invariant under the subgroup of squeeze mappings.  Using the above matrix representation of the affine group on the plane, the matrix M is a 2 √ó 2 real matrix . Accordingly, a non-singular M must have one of three forms that correspond to the trichotomy of Artzy.  Other affine groups  General case  Given any subgroup    G  <   G  L   (  V  )        G    G  L  V     G   of the general linear group , one can produce an affine group, sometimes denoted    Aff   (  G  )      Aff  G    \operatorname{Aff}(G)   analogously as     Aff   (  G  )    :=   V  ‚ãä  G      assign   Aff  G    right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  V  G     \operatorname{Aff}(G):=V\rtimes G   .  More generally and abstractly, given any group G and a representation of G on a vector space V ,    œÅ  :   G  ‚Üí   GL   (  V  )        normal-:  œÅ   normal-‚Üí  G   GL  V      \rho\colon G\to\operatorname{GL}(V)   one gets 3 an associated affine group    V   ‚ãä  œÅ   G      subscript  right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  œÅ   V  G    V\rtimes_{\rho}G   : one can say that the affine group obtained is ‚Äúa group extension by a vector representation‚Äù, and as above, one has the short exact sequence:      1  ‚Üí  V  ‚Üí   V   ‚ãä  œÅ   G   ‚Üí  G  ‚Üí  1.       normal-‚Üí  1  V    normal-‚Üí      subscript  right-normal-factor-semidirect-product  œÅ   V  G     normal-‚Üí    G    normal-‚Üí    1.     1\to V\to V\rtimes_{\rho}G\to G\to 1.     Special affine group  The subset of all invertible affine transformations preserving a fixed volume form, or in terms of the semi-direct product, the set of all elements ( M , v ) with M of determinant 1, is a subgroup known as the special affine group .  Projective subgroup  Presuming knowledge of projectivity and the projective group of projective geometry , the affine group can be easily specified. For example, G√ºnter Ewald wrote:. 4   The set   ùîì   ùîì   \mathfrak{P}   of all projective collineations of P n is a group which we may call the projective group of P n . If we proceed from P n to the affine space A n by declaring a hyperplane œâ to be a hyperplane at infinity , we obtain the affine group    ùîÑ   ùîÑ   \mathfrak{A}   of A n as the subgroup of   ùîì   ùîì   \mathfrak{P}   consisting of all elements of   ùîì   ùîì   \mathfrak{P}   that leave œâ fixed.     ùîÑ  ‚äÇ  ùîì      ùîÑ  ùîì    \mathfrak{A}\subset\mathfrak{P}       Poincar√© group  The Poincar√© group is the affine group of the Lorentz group     O   (  1  ,  3  )       O   1  3     O(1,3)        ùêë   1  ,  3    ‚ãä   O   (  1  ,  3  )       right-normal-factor-semidirect-product   superscript  ùêë   1  3     normal-O  1  3     \mathbf{R}^{1,3}\rtimes\operatorname{O}(1,3)     This example is very important in relativity .
