Abel's summation formula

In mathematics, Abel's summation formula, introduced by Niels Henrik Abel, is intensively used in number theory to compute series.
Identity
Let 
 
 
 
  be a sequence of real or complex numbers and 
 
 
 
  a function of class 

. Then



where



Indeed, this is integration by parts for a Riemann–Stieltjes integral.
More generally, we have



Examples
Euler–Mascheroni constant
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and



which is a method to represent the Euler–Mascheroni constant.
Representation of Riemann's zeta function
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  and



The formula holds for 
 
 
 
  It may be used to derive Dirichlet's theorem, that is, 
 
 
 
  has a simple pole with residue 1 in s = 1.
Reciprocal of Riemann zeta function
If 
 
 
 
  is the Möbius function and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is Mertens function and



This formula holds for
