   Benzoyl-CoA reductase      Benzoyl-CoA reductase   In enzymology , a benzoyl-CoA reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzoyl-CoA + reduced acceptor + 2 ATP + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA + acceptor + 2 ADP + 2 phosphate   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are benzoyl-CoA , reduced acceptor , ATP , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA , acceptor , ADP , and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cyclohexa-1,5-diene-1-carbonyl-CoA:acceptor oxidoreductase (aromatizing, ATP-forming) . This enzyme is also called benzoyl-CoA reductase (dearomatizing) . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation . It has 2 cofactors : manganese , and Magnesium .
