Abc conjecture




Abc conjecture

The abc conjecture (also known as the Oesterlé–Masser conjecture) is a conjecture in number theory, first proposed by  and  as an integer analogue of the Mason–Stothers theorem for polynomials. The conjecture is stated in terms of three positive integers, a, b and c (hence the name), which have no common factors greater than 1 and satisfy a + b = c. If d denotes the product of the distinct prime factors of abc, the conjecture essentially states that d is usually not much smaller than c. In other words: if a and b are composed from large powers of primes, then c is usually not divisible by large powers of primes. The precise statement is given below.
The abc conjecture has already become well known for the number of interesting consequences it entails. Many famous conjectures and theorems in number theory would follow immediately from the abc conjecture.  described the abc conjecture as "the most important unsolved problem in Diophantine analysis".
Several solutions have been proposed to the abc conjecture, the most recent of which is still being evaluated by the mathematical community.
Formulations
The abc conjecture can be expressed as follows: For every ε > 0, there are only finitely many triples of coprime positive integers a + b 
 
 
 
  c such that c > d1+ε, where d denotes the product of the distinct prime factors of abc.
To illustrate the terms used, if

a = 16 = 24,
 
b = 17, and
 
c = 16 + 17 = 33 = 3·11,
 

then d = 2·17·3·11 = 1122, which is greater than c. Therefore, for all ε > 0, c is not greater than d1+ε. According to the conjecture, most coprime triples where  are like the ones used in this example, and for only a few exceptions is c > d1+ε.
To add more terminology: For a positive integer n, the radical of n, denoted rad(n), is the product of the distinct prime factors of n. For example

rad(16) = rad(24) = 2,
rad(17) = 17,
rad(18) = rad(2·32) = 2·3 = 6.

If a, b, and c are coprime1 positive integers such that a + b = c, it turns out that "usually" c  ABC Conjecture. For every ε > 0, there exist only finitely many triples (a, b, c) of positive coprime integers, with a + b = c, such that



An equivalent formulation states that:

ABC Conjecture II. For every ε > 0, there exists a constant Kε such that for all triples (a, b, c) of coprime positive integers, with a + b = c, the inequality



holds.

A third formulation of the conjecture involves the quality q(a, b, c) of the triple (a, b, c), defined as



For example,

q(4, 127, 131) = log(131) / log(rad(4·127·131)) = log(131) / log(2·127·131) = 0.46820...
q(3, 125, 128) = log(128) / log(rad(3·125·128)) = log(128) / log(30) = 1.426565...

A typical triple (a, b, c) of coprime positive integers with a + b = c will have c  1 such as in the second example are rather special, they consist of numbers divisible by high powers of small prime numbers.

ABC Conjecture III. For every ε > 0, there exist only finitely many triples (a, b, c) of coprime positive integers with a + b = c such that q(a, b, c) > 1 + ε.

Whereas it is known that there are infinitely many triples (a, b, c) of coprime positive integers with a + b = c such that q(a, b, c) > 1, the conjecture predicts that only finitely many of those have q > 1.01 or q > 1.001 or even q > 1.0001, etc.
Examples of triples with small radical
The condition that ε > 0 is necessary for the truth of the conjecture, as there exist infinitely many triples a, b, c with rad(abc) 6n − 1,

c = 26n.
 

As a and c together contribute only a factor of two to the radical, while b is divisible by 9, rad(abc)  1. This is because rad(abc) = rad(a)rad(b)rad(c) = 2rad(b). b = 64n − 1n = (64 − 1)(...) = 32 × 7 × (...). So b = 32r for some r. So rad(b) = rad(32r) ≤ 3r = b/3. So rad(abc) = 2rad(b) ≤ 2b/3  2 will make b divisible by p2, because 2p(p−1) ≡ 1 (mod p2) and 2p(p−1) − 1 will be a factor of b.
A list of the highest-quality triples (triples with a particularly small radical relative to c) is given below; the highest quality, 1.6299, was found by Eric Reyssat  for

a = 2,
 
b = 310·109 = 6,436,341,
 
c = 235 = 6,436,343,
 
rad(abc) = 15042.
 

Some consequences
The abc conjecture has a large number of consequences. These include both known results (some of which have been proven separately since the conjecture has been stated) and conjectures for which it gives a conditional proof. While an earlier proof of the conjecture would have been more significant in terms of consequences, the abc conjecture itself remains of interest for the other conjectures it would prove, together with its numerous links with deep questions in number theory.

Thue–Siegel–Roth theorem on diophantine approximation of algebraic numbers
Fermat's Last Theorem for all sufficiently large exponents (already proven in general by Andrew Wiles) 
The Mordell conjecture (already proven in general by Gerd Faltings) 
The Erdős–Woods conjecture except for a finite number of counterexamples 
The existence of infinitely many non-Wieferich primes in every base b > 1 
The weak form of Marshall Hall's conjecture on the separation between squares and cubes of integers 
The Fermat–Catalan conjecture, a generalization of Fermat's last theorem concerning powers that are sums of powers 
The L function  formed with the Legendre symbol, has no Siegel zero (this consequence actually requires a uniform version of the abc conjecture in number fields, not only the abc conjecture as formulated above for rational integers) 
P(x) has only finitely many perfect powers for integral x for P a polynomial with at least three simple zeros.2
A generalization of Tijdeman's theorem concerning the number of solutions of ym = xn + k (Tijdeman's theorem answers the case k = 1), and Pillai's conjecture (1931) concerning the number of solutions of Aym = Bxn + k.
It is equivalent to the Granville–Langevin conjecture, that if f is a square-free binary form of degree n > 2, then for every real β > 2 there is a constant C(f, β) such that for all coprime integers x,y, the radical of f(x, y) exceeds C·max{|x|,|y|}n−β.34
It is equivalent to the modified Szpiro conjecture, which would yield a bound of rad(abc)1.2+ε .

has shown that the abc conjecture implies that the Diophantine equation n! + A= k2 has only finitely many solutions for any given integer A.
There are ~cfN positive integers n ≤ N for which f(n)/B' is square-free, with cf > 0 a positive constant defined as 
 
 
 
 . 

Fermat's Last theorem
Fermat's Last Theorem was proven by Andrew Wiles, and the proof is famous for its difficulty. But if a strong effective form of the abc conjecture is correct, the proof of Fermat's Last theorem becomes much shorter and easier as follows:5
 If abc conjecture is correct when K = 1 and ε ＝ 1, and when the co-prime natural numbers A, B, C satisfy an equation A + B = C, we have C 2.
We assume the co-prime natural numbers an, bn, cn satisfy an + bn = cn, replacing A to an, B to bn, C to cn. This equation an + bn = cn is the Fermat's Last theorem. Then we get:


 
  (Because 
 
 


 
 .)
Now we get:


 
  That is why n must be smaller than 6. But for exponents n = 3, 4, 5, we already have proofs, which were proved before (Fermat, Euler, Dirichlet or Legendre), so no three positive integers a, b, and c can satisfy the equation an + bn = cn for any integer value of n > 2.6
In this argument one can allow ε to be smaller and K to be larger, at the cost of requiring explicit checks that there are no small solutions to the Fermat equation. These checks are possible for reasonable values of ε and K, but it is possible (even perhaps likely) that a proof of the abc conjecture will give only ineffective bounds on K in terms of ε. In this case the deduction yields only the weaker statement that there are finitely many solutions to the Fermat equation. This is stronger than Faltings' theorem, which states that there are finitely many solutions to the Fermat equation for each n.
Theoretical results
The abc conjecture implies that c can be bounded above by a near-linear function of the radical of abc. However, exponential bounds are known. Specifically, the following bounds have been proven:


 
  ,


 
  , and


 
  .
In these bounds, K1 is a constant that does not depend on a, b, or c, and K2 and K3 are constants that depend on ε (in an effectively computable way) but not on a, b, or c. The bounds apply to any triple for which c > 2.
Computational results
In 2006, the Mathematics Department of Leiden University in the Netherlands, together with the Dutch Kennislink science institute, launched the ABC@Home project, a grid computing system, which aims to discover additional triples a, b, c with rad(abc)  17 |- !   ! q > 1 ! q > 1.05 ! q > 1.1 ! q > 1.2 ! q > 1.3 ! q > 1.4 |- ! c 2 | 6 || 4 || 4 || 2 || 0 || 0 |- ! c 3 | 31 || 17 || 14 || 8 || 3 || 1 |- ! c 4 | 120 || 74 || 50 || 22 || 8 || 3 |- ! c 5 | 418 || 240 || 152 || 51 || 13 || 6 |- ! c 6 | 1,268 || 667 || 379 || 102 || 29 || 11 |- ! c 7 | 3,499 || 1,669 || 856 || 210 || 60 || 17 |- ! c 8 | 8,987 || 3,869 || 1,801 || 384 || 98 || 25 |- ! c 9 | 22,316 || 8,742 || 3,693 || 706 || 144 || 34 |- ! c 10 | 51,677 || 18,233 || 7,035 || 1,159 || 218 || 51 |- ! c 11 | 116,978 || 37,612 || 13,266 || 1,947 || 327 || 64 |- ! c 12 | 252,856 || 73,714 || 23,773 || 3,028 || 455 || 74 |- ! c 13 | 528,275 || 139,762 || 41,438 || 4,519 || 599 || 84 |- ! c 14 | 1,075,319 || 258,168 || 70,047 || 6,665 || 769 || 98 |- ! c 15 | 2,131,671 || 463,446 || 115,041 || 9,497 || 998 || 112 |- ! c 16 | 4,119,410 || 812,499 || 184,727 || 13,118 || 1,232 || 126 |- ! c 17 | 7,801,334 || 1,396,909 || 290,965 || 17,890 || 1,530 || 143 |- ! c 18 | 14,482,065 || 2,352,105 || 449,194 || 24,013 || 1,843 || 160 |- |}

Refined forms and generalizations
A stronger inequality proposed by  states that in the inequality, one can replace rad(abc) by

ε−ω rad(abc),
 

where ω is the total number of distinct primes dividing a, b and c .
Andrew Granville noticed that the minimum of the function 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
  occurs when 
 
 
 
 .
This incited  to propose a sharper form of the abc conjecture, namely:


 
  with 
 
 
 
  an absolute constant. After some computational experiments in order to find a value for 
 
 
 
 , he found that a value of 
 
 
 
  was admissible.
This version is called "explicit abc conjecture".
From the previous inequality, Baker deduced a stronger form of the original abc conjecture: let a, b, c be coprime positive integers with a + b = c; then we have

formulated the n conjecture—a version of the abc conjecture involving n > 2 integers.
Attempts at solution
Lucien Szpiro attempted a solution in 2007, but it was found to be incorrect.10
In August 2012, Shinichi Mochizuki released a series of four preprints containing a claim to a proof of the abc conjecture.11 Mochizuki calls the theory on which this proof is based "inter-universal Teichmüller theory", and it has other applications, including a proof of Szpiro's conjecture and Vojta's conjecture.12 Experts were expected to take months to check Mochizuki's new mathematical machinery, which was developed over decades in 500 pages of preprints and several of his prior papers.13
When an error in one of the articles was pointed out by Vesselin Dimitrov and Akshay Venkatesh in October 2012, Mochizuki posted a comment on his website acknowledging the mistake, stating that it would not affect the result, and promising a corrected version in the near future.14 He revised all of his papers on "inter-universal Teichmüller theory", the latest of which is dated May 2015.15 Mochizuki has refused all requests for media interviews, but released progress reports in December 201316 and December 2014.17 According to Mochizuki, verification of the core proof is "for all practical purposes, complete." However, he also stated that an official declaration shouldn't happen until some time later in the 2010s, due to the importance of the results and new techniques. In addition, he predicts that there are no proofs of the abc conjecture that use significantly different techniques than those used in his papers.18 There was a workshop on IUT at Kyoto University in March 2015 and another one will be held at Clay Mathematics Institute in December 2015.19
