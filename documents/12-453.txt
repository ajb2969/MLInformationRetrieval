Simply connected at infinity

In topology, a branch of mathematics, a topological space X is said to be simply connected at infinity if for all compact subsets C of X, there is a compact set D in X containing C so that the induced map



is trivial. Intuitively, this is the property that loops far away from a small subspace of X can be collapsed, no matter how bad the small subspace is.
The Whitehead manifold is an example of a 3-manifold that is contractible but not simply connected at infinity. Since this property is invariant under homeomorphism, this proves that the Whitehead manifold is not homeomorphic to R3.
However, it is a theorem of John R. Stallings1 that for 
 
 
 
 , a contractible n-manifold is homeomorphic to Rn precisely when it is simply connected at infinity.
