   Simply connected at infinity      Simply connected at infinity   In topology , a branch of mathematics, a topological space  X is said to be simply connected at infinity if for all compact subsets C of X , there is a compact set D in X containing C so that the induced map        π  1    (   X  -  D   )    →    π  1    (   X  -  C   )       normal-→     subscript  π  1     X  D       subscript  π  1     X  C      \pi_{1}(X-D)\to\pi_{1}(X-C)\,     is trivial. Intuitively, this is the property that loops far away from a small subspace of X can be collapsed, no matter how bad the small subspace is.  The Whitehead manifold is an example of a 3- manifold that is contractible but not simply connected at infinity. Since this property is invariant under homeomorphism , this proves that the Whitehead manifold is not homeomorphic to R 3 .  However, it is a theorem of John R. Stallings 1 that for    n  ≥  5      n  5    n\geq 5   , a contractible n -manifold is homeomorphic to R n precisely when it is simply connected at infinity.
