Paranormal subgroup

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a paranormal subgroup is a subgroup such that the subgroup generated by it and any conjugate of it, is also generated by it and a conjugate of it within that subgroup.

  generated by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is also equal to 
 
 
 
 . Equivalently, a subgroup is paranormal if its weak closure and normal closure coincide in all intermediate subgroups.
Here are some facts relating paranormality to other subgroup properties:

Every pronormal subgroup, and hence, every normal subgroup and every abnormal subgroup, is paranormal.
Every paranormal subgroup is a polynormal subgroup.
In finite solvable groups, every polynormal subgroup is paranormal.
