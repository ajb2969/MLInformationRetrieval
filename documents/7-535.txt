   Paranormal subgroup      Paranormal subgroup   In mathematics , in the field of group theory , a paranormal subgroup is a subgroup such that the subgroup generated by it and any conjugate of it, is also generated by it and a conjugate of it within that subgroup.  In symbols,   H   H   H   is paranormal in   G   G   G   if given any   g   g   g   in   G   G   G   , the subgroup   K   K   K   generated by   H   H   H   and    H  g     superscript  H  g    H^{g}   is also equal to    H  K     superscript  H  K    H^{K}   . Equivalently, a subgroup is paranormal if its weak closure and normal closure coincide in all intermediate subgroups.  Here are some facts relating paranormality to other subgroup properties:   Every pronormal subgroup , and hence, every normal subgroup and every abnormal subgroup , is paranormal.  Every paranormal subgroup is a polynormal subgroup .  In finite solvable groups, every polynormal subgroup is paranormal.   "  Category:Subgroup properties
