   5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate Delta-isomerase      5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate Delta-isomerase   In enzymology , a 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-carboxy-2-oxohept-3-enedioate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate , and one product , 5-carboxy-2-oxohept-3-enedioate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-carboxymethyl-2-hydroxymuconate Delta2,Delta4-2-oxo,Delta3-isomerase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and benzoate degradation via hydroxylation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
