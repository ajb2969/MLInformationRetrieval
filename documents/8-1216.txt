Tight closure

In mathematics, in the area of commutative algebra, tight closure is an operation defined on ideals in positive characteristic. It was introduced by .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a commutative noetherian ring containing a field of characteristic 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
  is a prime number.
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be an ideal of 
 
 
 
 . The tight closure of 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is another ideal of 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
 
 . The ideal 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows.


 
  if and only if there exists a 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is not contained in any minimal prime ideal of 
 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is reduced, then one can instead consider all 
 
 
 
 .
Here 
 
 
 
 
  is used to denote the ideal of 
 
 
 
  generated by the 
 
 
 
 'th powers of elements of 
 
 
 
 , called the 
 
 
 
 th Frobenius power of 
 
 
 
 
 .
An ideal is called tightly closed if 
 
 
 
 . A ring in which all ideals are tightly closed is called weakly 
 
 
 
 -regular (for Frobenius regular). A previous major open question in tight closure is whether the operation of tight closure commutes with localization, and so there is the additional notion of 
 
 
 
 -regular, which says that all ideals of the ring are still tightly closed in localizations of the ring.
found a counterexample to the localization property of tight closure. However, there is still an open question of whether every weakly 
 
 
 
 -regular ring is 
 
 
 
 
 -regular. That is, if every ideal in a ring is tightly closed, is it true that every ideal in every localization of that ring also tightly closed?
