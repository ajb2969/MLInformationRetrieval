   Tight closure      Tight closure   In mathematics , in the area of commutative algebra , tight closure is an operation defined on ideals in positive characteristic . It was introduced by .  Let   R   R   R   be a commutative noetherian ring containing a field of characteristic    p  >  0      p  0    p>0   . Hence   p   p   p   is a prime number .  Let   I   I   I   be an ideal of   R   R   R   . The tight closure of   I   I   I   , denoted by    I  *     superscript  I     I^{*}   , is another ideal of   R   R   R   containing   I   I   I   . The ideal    I  *     superscript  I     I^{*}   is defined as follows.      z  ∈   I  *       z   superscript  I      z\in I^{*}   if and only if there exists a    c  ∈  R      c  R    c\in R   , where   c   c   c   is not contained in any minimal prime ideal of   R   R   R   , such that     c   z   p  e     ∈   I   [   p  e   ]          c   superscript  z   superscript  p  e      superscript  I   delimited-[]   superscript  p  e       cz^{p^{e}}\in I^{[p^{e}]}   for all    e  ≫  0     much-greater-than  e  0    e\gg 0   . If   R   R   R   is reduced, then one can instead consider all    e  >  0      e  0    e>0   .  Here    I   [   p  e   ]      superscript  I   delimited-[]   superscript  p  e      I^{[p^{e}]}   is used to denote the ideal of   R   R   R   generated by the    p  e     superscript  p  e    p^{e}   'th powers of elements of   I   I   I   , called the   e   e   e   th Frobenius power of   I   I   I   .  An ideal is called tightly closed if    I  =   I  *       I   superscript  I      I=I^{*}   . A ring in which all ideals are tightly closed is called weakly   F   F   F   -regular (for Frobenius regular). A previous major open question in tight closure is whether the operation of tight closure commutes with localization , and so there is the additional notion of   F   F   F   -regular, which says that all ideals of the ring are still tightly closed in localizations of the ring.  found a counterexample to the localization property of tight closure. However, there is still an open question of whether every weakly   F   F   F   -regular ring is   F   F   F   -regular. That is, if every ideal in a ring is tightly closed, is it true that every ideal in every localization of that ring also tightly closed?
