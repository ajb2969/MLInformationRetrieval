   6-methylsalicylate decarboxylase      6-methylsalicylate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a 6-methylsalicylate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-methylsalicylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-cresol + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 6-methylsalicylate , and two products , 3-cresol and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-methylsalicylate carboxy-lyase (3-cresol-forming) . Other names in common use include 6-methylsalicylic acid (2,6-cresotic acid) decarboxylase , 6-MSA decarboxylase , and 6-methylsalicylate carboxy-lyase .
