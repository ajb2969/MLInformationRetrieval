   Cellulose synthase (GDP-forming)      Cellulose synthase (GDP-forming)   In enzymology , a cellulose synthase (GDP-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP-glucose + (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)n   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)n + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-glucose and (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)n , whereas its two products are GDP and (1,4-beta-D-glucosyl)n+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-glucose:1,4-beta-D-glucan 4-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include cellulose synthase (guanosine diphosphate-forming) , cellulose synthetase , guanosine diphosphoglucose-1,4-beta-glucan glucosyltransferase , and guanosine diphosphoglucose-cellulose glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
