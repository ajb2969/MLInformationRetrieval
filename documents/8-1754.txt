Shift matrix

In mathematics, a shift matrix is a binary matrix with ones only on the superdiagonal or subdiagonal, and zeroes elsewhere. A shift matrix U with ones on the superdiagonal is an upper shift matrix. The alternative subdiagonal matrix L is unsurprisingly known as a lower shift matrix. The (i,j):th component of U and L are


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Kronecker delta symbol.
For example, the 5×5 shift matrices are






U_5=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix} \quad L_5=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}. 
Clearly, the transpose of a lower shift matrix is an upper shift matrix and vice versa.
As a linear transformation, a lower shift matrix shifts the components of a row vector one position to the right, with a zero appearing in the first position. An upper shift matrix shifts the components of a row vector one position to the left, with a zero appearing in the last position.1
Premultiplying a matrix A by a lower shift matrix results in the elements of A being shifted downward by one position, with zeroes appearing in the top row. Postmultiplication by a lower shift matrix results in a shift left. Similar operations involving an upper shift matrix result in the opposite shift.
Clearly all shift matrices are nilpotent; an n by n shift matrix S becomes the null matrix when raised to the power of its dimension n.
Properties
Let L and U be the n by n lower and upper shift matrices, respectively. The following properties hold for both U and L. Let us therefore only list the properties for U:

det(U) = 0
trace(U) = 0
rank(U) = n−1
The characteristic polynomials of U is





Un = 0. This follows from the previous property by the Cayley–Hamilton theorem.


The permanent of U is 0.

The following properties show how U and L are related:

LT = U; UT = L


The null spaces of U and L are








The spectrum of U and L is 
 
 
 
 . The algebraic multiplicity of 0 is n, and its geometric multiplicity is 1. From the expressions for the null spaces, it follows that (up to a scaling) the only eigenvector for U is 
 
 
 
 , and the only eigenvector for L is 
 
 
 
 .


For LU and UL we have








These matrices are both idempotent, symmetric, and have the same rank as U and L



Ln-aUn-a + LaUa = Un-aLn-a + UaLa = I (the identity matrix), for any integer a between 0 and n inclusive.

If N is any nilpotent matrix, then N is similar to a block diagonal matrix of the form


 
  where each of the blocks S1, S2, ..., Sr is a shift matrix (possibly of different sizes).23
Examples






S=\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 1 & 0 \end{pmatrix}; \quad A=\begin{pmatrix} 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 3 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 \end{pmatrix}.
Then 
 
 

Clearly there are many possible permutations. For example, 
 
 
 
  is equal to the matrix A shifted up and left along the main diagonal.






S^{T}AS=\begin{pmatrix} 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 3 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 2 & 2 & 2 & 1 & 0 \\ 1 & 1 & 1 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 \end{pmatrix}.
