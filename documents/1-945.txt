   Subset      Subset   (Figure)  Euler diagram showing  A is a proper subset of B and conversely B is a proper superset of A   In mathematics , especially in set theory , a set  A is a subset of a set B , or equivalently B is a superset of A , if A is "contained" inside B , that is, all elements of A are also elements of B . A and B may coincide. The relationship of one set being a subset of another is called inclusion or sometimes containment .  The subset relation defines a partial order on sets.  The algebra of subsets forms a Boolean algebra in which the subset relation is called inclusion .  Definitions  If A and B are sets and every element of A is also an element of B , then:  :* A is a subset of (or is included in) B , denoted by    A  ⊆  B      A  B    A\subseteq B   ,   or equivalently  B is a superset of (or includes) A , denoted by     B  ⊇  A   .      A  B    B\supseteq A.        If A is a subset of B , but A is not equal to B (i.e. there exists at least one element of B which is not an element of A ), then  :* A is also a proper (or strict ) subset of B ; this is written as     A  ⊊  B   .      A  B    A\subsetneq B.      or equivalently  B is a proper superset of A ; this is written as     B  ⊋  A   .      A  B    B\supsetneq A.        For any set S , the inclusion relation ⊆ is a partial order on the set    𝒫   (  S  )       𝒫  S    \mathcal{P}(S)   of all subsets of S (the power set of S ).  When quantified,    A  ⊆  B      A  normal-⊆  B    A⊆B   is represented as: }. 1   ⊂ and ⊃ symbols  Some authors use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to indicate subset and superset respectively; that is, with the same meaning and instead of the symbols, ⊆ and ⊇. 2 So for example, for these authors, it is true of every set A that .  Other authors prefer to use the symbols ⊂ and ⊃ to indicate proper subset and superset, respectively, instead of ⊊ and ⊋. 3 This usage makes ⊆ and ⊂ analogous to the inequality symbols ≤ and <. a="" also="" always="" an="" and="" another="" any="" are="" as="" b="{1," both="" but="" by="" can="" cardinality="" cases="" concept="" convention="" corresponds="" counter="" d="{1," definitely="" denoted="" diagram="" does="" e="{1," elements="" en.svg="" equal="" example="" examples="=" except="" expressions="" false="" finite="" for="" form="" former="" given="" greater="" has="" if="" in="" infinite="" initial="" intuition.="" is="" it="" itself="" itself.="" larger="" latter="" less="" likewise="" may="" not="" number="" numbers="" odd="" of="" one="" or="" points="" polygons="" proper="" rational="" regular="" run="" same="" segment="" set="" set.="" sets="" similarly="" size="" subset="" subset.="" such="" than="" that="" the="" then="" these="" this="" thus="" to="" true="" true.="" two="" using="" which="" whole="" widths="270" x="" x.=""> File:Example of A is a proper subset of B.svg|A is a proper subset of B File:Example of C is no proper subset of B.svg|C is a subset but no proper subset of B .  Other properties of inclusion  Inclusion is the canonical partial order in the sense that every partially ordered set ( X ,   ⪯   precedes-or-equals   \preceq   ) is isomorphic to some collection of sets ordered by inclusion. The ordinal numbers are a simple example—if each ordinal n is identified with the set [ n ] of all ordinals less than or equal to n , then a ≤ b if and only if [ a ] ⊆ [ b ].  For the power set     𝒫   (  S  )       𝒫  S    \mathcal{P}(S)   of a set S , the inclusion partial order is (up to an order isomorphism ) the Cartesian product of k = | S | (the cardinality of S ) copies of the partial order on {0,1} for which 0 1, s 2 , …, s k } and associating with each subset T ⊆ S (which is to say with each element of 2 S ) the k -tuple from {0,1} k of which the i th coordinate is 1 if and only if s i is a member of T .
