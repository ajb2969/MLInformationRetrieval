   Whitney umbrella      Whitney umbrella   right|frame|240px|Section of the surface In mathematics , the Whitney umbrella (or Whitney's umbrella and sometimes called a Cayley umbrella ) is a self-intersecting surface placed in three dimensions . It is the union of all straight lines that pass through points of a fixed parabola and are perpendicular to a fixed straight line, parallel to the axis of the parabola and lying on its perpendicular bisecting plane .  Formulas  Whitney's umbrella can be given by the parametric equations in Cartesian coordinates      x   (  u  ,  v  )    =   u  v         x   u  v      u  v     x(u,v)=uv   ;     y   (  u  ,  v  )    =  u        y   u  v    u    y(u,v)=u   ;     z   (  u  ,  v  )    =   v  2         z   u  v     superscript  v  2     z(u,v)=v^{2}   where the parameters u and v range over the real numbers . It is also given by the implicit equation       x  2   =    y  2   z        superscript  x  2      superscript  y  2   z     x^{2}=y^{2}z   This formula also includes the negative z axis (which is called the handle of the umbrella).  Properties  (Figure)  Whitney umbrella as a ruled surface, generated by a moving straight line.   (Figure)  Whitney umbrella made with a single string inside a plastic cube.   Whitney's umbrella is a ruled surface and a right conoid . It is important in the field of singularity theory , as a simple local model of a pinch point  singularity . The pinch point and the fold singularity are the only stable local singularities of maps from R 2 to R 3 .  It is named after the American  mathematician  Hassler Whitney .  In string theory , a Whitney brane is a D7-brane wrapping a variety whose singularities are locally modeled by the Whitney umbrella. Whitney branes appear naturally when taking Sen's weak coupling limit of F-theory .  See also   Cross-cap  Right conoid  Ruled surface   References    (Images and movies of the Whitney umbrella.)
