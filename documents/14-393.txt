   Topological category      Topological category   In category theory , a discipline in mathematics , the notion of topological category has a number of different, inequivalent definitions.  In one approach, a topological category is a category that is enriched over the category of compactly generated  Hausdorff spaces . They can be used as a foundation for higher category theory , where they can play the role of (∞,1)-categories. An important example of a topological category in this sense is given by the category of CW complexes , where each set Hom( X , Y ) of continuous maps from X to Y is equipped with the compact-open topology .  In another approach, a topological category is defined as a category   C   C   C   along with a forgetful functor     T  :   C  →  𝐒𝐞𝐭      normal-:  T   normal-→  C  𝐒𝐞𝐭     T:C\to\mathbf{Set}   that maps to the category of sets and has the following three properties:      C   C   C   admits initial (or weak) structures with respect to   T   T   T     Constant functions in   𝐒𝐞𝐭   𝐒𝐞𝐭   \mathbf{Set}   lift to   C   C   C   - morphisms  Fibers       T   -  1    x   ,  x   ∈  𝐒𝐞𝐭          superscript  T    1    x   x   𝐒𝐞𝐭    T^{-1}x,x\in\mathbf{Set}   are small (they are sets and not proper classes ).   An example of a topological category in this sense is the categories of all topological spaces with continuous maps, where one uses the standard forgetful functor. 1  See also   Infinity category  Simplicial category   References     "  Category:Category theory     ↩
