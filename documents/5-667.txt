   Birkhoff interpolation      Birkhoff interpolation   In mathematics , Birkhoff interpolation is an extension of polynomial interpolation . It refers to the problem finding a polynomial p of degree d such that certain derivatives have specified values at specified points:          p   (   n  i   )     (   x  i   )    =   y  i      for  i   =   1  ,  …  ,  d     ,     formulae-sequence       superscript  p   subscript  n  i     subscript  x  i     subscript  y  i        for  i    1  normal-…  d      p^{(n_{i})}(x_{i})=y_{i}\qquad\mbox{for }i=1,\ldots,d,   where the data points    (   x  i   ,   y  i   )      subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i     (x_{i},y_{i})   and the nonnegative integers    n  i     subscript  n  i    n_{i}   are given. It differs from Hermite interpolation in that it is possible to specify derivatives of p at some points without specifying the lower derivatives or the polynomial itself. The name refers to George David Birkhoff , who first studied the problem in .  In contrast to Lagrange interpolation and Hermite interpolation , a Birkhoff interpolation problem does not always have a unique solution. For instance, there is no quadratic polynomial p such that p (−1) = p (1) = 0 and p ′(0) = 1. On the other hand, the Birkhoff interpolation problem where the values of p ′(−1), p (0) and p ′(1) are given always has a unique solution .  An important problem in the theory of Birkhoff interpolation is to classify those problems that have a unique solution.  formulates the problem as follows. Let d denote the number of conditions (as above) and let k be the number of interpolation points. Given a d -by- k matrix E , all of whose entries are either 0 or 1, such that exactly d entries are 1, then the corresponding problem is to determine p such that         p   (  j  )     (   x  i   )    =   y   i  ,  j       for all   (  i  ,  j  )   with   e   i  j     =  1.      formulae-sequence       superscript  p  j    subscript  x  i     subscript  y   i  j         for all   i  j   with   subscript  e    i  j     1.     p^{(j)}(x_{i})=y_{i,j}\qquad\text{for all }(i,j)\text{ with }e_{ij}=1.   The matrix E is called the incidence matrix. For example, the incidence matrices for the interpolation problems mentioned in the previous paragraph are:        [     1    0    0      0    1    0      1    0    0     ]   and   [     0    1    0      1    0    0      0    1    0     ]    .       1  0  0    0  1  0    1  0  0    and    0  1  0    1  0  0    0  1  0      \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0\\
 0&1&0\\
 1&0&0\end{bmatrix}\quad\text{and}\quad\begin{bmatrix}0&1&0\\
 1&0&0\\
 0&1&0\end{bmatrix}.   Now the question is: does a Birkhoff interpolation problem with a given incidence matrix have a unique solution for any choice of the interpolation points?  The case with k = 2 interpolation points was tackled by . Let S m denote the sum of the entries in the first m columns of the incidence matrix:        S  m   =    ∑   i  =  1   k     ∑   j  =  1   m    e   i  j       .       subscript  S  m     superscript   subscript     i  1    k     superscript   subscript     j  1    m    subscript  e    i  j        S_{m}=\sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{m}e_{ij}.   Then the Birkhoff interpolation problem with k = 2 has a unique solution if and only if S m ≥ m for all m .  showed that this is a necessary condition for all values of k .
