Birkhoff interpolation

In mathematics, Birkhoff interpolation is an extension of polynomial interpolation. It refers to the problem finding a polynomial p of degree d such that certain derivatives have specified values at specified points:


 
  where the data points 
 
 
 
  and the nonnegative integers 
 
 
 
  are given. It differs from Hermite interpolation in that it is possible to specify derivatives of p at some points without specifying the lower derivatives or the polynomial itself. The name refers to George David Birkhoff, who first studied the problem in .
In contrast to Lagrange interpolation and Hermite interpolation, a Birkhoff interpolation problem does not always have a unique solution. For instance, there is no quadratic polynomial p such that p(−1) = p(1) = 0 and p′(0) = 1. On the other hand, the Birkhoff interpolation problem where the values of p′(−1), p(0) and p′(1) are given always has a unique solution .
An important problem in the theory of Birkhoff interpolation is to classify those problems that have a unique solution.  formulates the problem as follows. Let d denote the number of conditions (as above) and let k be the number of interpolation points. Given a d-by-k matrix E, all of whose entries are either 0 or 1, such that exactly d entries are 1, then the corresponding problem is to determine p such that


 
  The matrix E is called the incidence matrix. For example, the incidence matrices for the interpolation problems mentioned in the previous paragraph are:


 
  Now the question is: does a Birkhoff interpolation problem with a given incidence matrix have a unique solution for any choice of the interpolation points?
The case with k = 2 interpolation points was tackled by . Let Sm denote the sum of the entries in the first m columns of the incidence matrix:


 
  Then the Birkhoff interpolation problem with k = 2 has a unique solution if and only if Sm ≥ m for all m.  showed that this is a necessary condition for all values of k.
