Flavone apiosyltransferase




Flavone apiosyltransferase

In enzymology, a flavone apiosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-apiose + 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside 
 
 
 
  UDP + 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone 7-O-[beta-D-apiosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside]
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-apiose and 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside, whereas its 3 products are UDP, 5,7,4'-trihydroxyflavone (apigenin), and 7-O-[beta-D-apiosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside].
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 'UDP-apiose:5,4'-dihydroxyflavone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside 2-O-beta-D-apiofuranosyltransferase'''. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoapiose-flavone apiosyltransferase, and UDP-apiose:7-O-(beta-D-glucosyl)-flavone apiosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis.
