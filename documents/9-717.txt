   Commutant lifting theorem      Commutant lifting theorem   In operator theory , the commutant lifting theorem , due to Sz.-Nagy and Foias , is a powerful theorem used to prove several interpolation results.  Statement  The commutant lifting theorem states that if T is a contraction on a Hilbert space  H , U is its minimal unitary dilation acting on some Hilbert space K (which can be shown to exist by Sz.-Nagy's dilation theorem ), and R is an operator on H commuting with T , then there is an operator S on K commuting with U such that        R   T  n    =       P  H   S   U  n    |   H    ∀  n    ≥  0   ,          R   superscript  T  n       evaluated-at     subscript  P  H   S   superscript  U  n    H    for-all  n         0     RT^{n}=P_{H}SU^{n}|_{H}\;\forall n\geq 0,     and        ∥  S  ∥   =   ∥  R  ∥    .       norm  S    norm  R     \|S\|=\|R\|.     In other words, an operator from the commutant of T can be "lifted" to an operator in the commutant of the unitary dilation of T .  Applications  The commutant lifting theorem can be used to prove the left Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation theorem, the Sarason interpolation theorem , and the two-sided Nudelman theorem, among others.
