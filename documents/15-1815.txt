Cross Gramian

In control theory, the cross Gramian is a Gramian matrix used to determine how controllable and observable a linear system is.1 2
For the stable time-invariant linear system






the cross Gramian is defined as:



and thus also given by the solution to the Sylvester equation:



The triple 
 
 
 
  is controllable and observable if and only if the matrix 
 
 
 
  is nonsingular, (i.e. 
 
 
 
  has full rank, for any 
 
 
 
 ).
If the associated system 
 
 
 
  is furthermore symmetric, such that there exists a transformation 
 
 
 
  with






then the absolute value of the eigenvalues of the cross Gramian equal Hankel singular values:3



Thus the direct truncation of the singular value decomposition of the cross Gramian allows model order reduction (see 1) without a balancing procedure as opposed to balanced truncation.
Note
The cross Gramian is also referred to by
