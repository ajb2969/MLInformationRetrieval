   Cross Gramian      Cross Gramian   In control theory , the cross Gramian is a Gramian matrix used to determine how controllable and observable a linear system is. 1  2  For the stable time-invariant linear system       x  ˙   =    A  x   +   B   u          normal-˙  x       A  x     B  u      \dot{x}=Ax+Bu\,         y  =   C   x        y    C  x     y=Cx\,     the cross Gramian is defined as:       W  X   :=    ∫  0  ∞     e   A  t    B  C   e   A  t    d   t        assign   subscript  W  X     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e    A  t    B  C   superscript  e    A  t    d  t      W_{X}:=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{At}BCe^{At}dt\,     and thus also given by the solution to the Sylvester equation :        A   W  X    +    W  X   A    =   -   B   C             A   subscript  W  X       subscript  W  X   A        B  C      AW_{X}+W_{X}A=-BC\,     The triple    (  A  ,  B  ,  C  )     A  B  C    (A,B,C)   is controllable and observable if and only if the matrix    W  X     subscript  W  X    W_{X}   is nonsingular , (i.e.    W  X     subscript  W  X    W_{X}   has full rank, for any    t  >  0      t  0    t>0   ).  If the associated system    (  A  ,  B  ,  C  )     A  B  C    (A,B,C)   is furthermore symmetric, such that there exists a transformation   J   J   J   with       A  J   =   J    A  T           A  J     J   superscript  A  T      AJ=JA^{T}\,         B  =   J    C  T         B    J   superscript  C  T      B=JC^{T}\,     then the absolute value of the eigenvalues of the cross Gramian equal Hankel singular values : 3        |   λ   (   W  X   )    |   =    λ   (    W  C    W  O    )      .          λ   subscript  W  X         λ     subscript  W  C    subscript  W  O        |\lambda(W_{X})|=\sqrt{\lambda(W_{C}W_{O})}.\,     Thus the direct truncation of the singular value decomposition of the cross Gramian allows model order reduction (see 1 ) without a balancing procedure as opposed to balanced truncation .  Note  The cross Gramian is also referred to by    W   C  O      subscript  W    C  O     W_{CO}   .
