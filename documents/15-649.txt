   Splicing rule      Splicing rule   In mathematics and computer science, a splicing rule is a transformation on formal languages which formalises the action of gene splicing in molecular biology . A splicing language is a language generated by iterated application of a splicing rule: the splicing languages form a proper subset of the regular languages .  Definition  Let A be an alphabet and L a language, that is, a subset of the free monoid A ∗ . A splicing rule is a quadruple r = ( a , b , c , d ) of elements of A ∗ , and the action of the rule r on L is to produce the language        r   (  L  )    =   {   x  a  d  y   :     x  a  b  q   ,   p  c  d  y    ∈  L   }    .        r  L    conditional-set    x  a  d  y        x  a  b  q     p  c  d  y    L      r(L)=\{xady:xabq,pcdy\in L\}\ .     If R is a set of rules then R ( L ) is the union of the languages produced by the rules of R . We say that R  respects  L if R ( L ) is a subset of L . The R -closure of L is the union of L and all iterates of R on L : clearly it is respected by R . A splicing language is the R -closure of a finite language. 1  A rule set R is reflexive if ( a , b , c , d ) in R implies that ( a , b , a , b ) and ( c , d , c , d ) are in R . A splicing language is reflexive if it is defined by a reflexive rule set. 2  Examples   Let A = { a , b , c }. The rule ( caba , a , cab , a ) applied to the finite set { cabb , cabab , cabaab } generates the regular language caba ∗ b . 3   Properties   All splicing languages are regular. 4  Not all regular languages are splicing. 5 An example is ( aa ) ∗ over { a , b }. 6  If L is a regular language on the alphabet A , and z is a letter not in A , then the language { zw : w in L } is a splicing language. 7  There is an algorithm to determine whether a given regular language is a reflexive splicing language. 8  The set of splicing rules that respect a regular language can be determined from the syntactic monoid of the language. 9   References     "  Category:Semigroup theory  Category:Formal languages  Category:Combinatorics on words     Anderson (2006) p. 236 ↩   Anderson (2006) p. 238 ↩  Anderson (2006) p. 239 ↩  Anderson (2006) p. 240 ↩    Anderson (2006) p. 242 ↩  Anderson (2006) p. 241 ↩
