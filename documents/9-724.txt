   Mosco convergence      Mosco convergence   In mathematical analysis , Mosco convergence is a notion of convergence for functionals that is used in nonlinear analysis and set-valued analysis . It is a particular case of Γ-convergence . Mosco convergence is sometimes phrased as “weak Γ-liminf and strong Γ-limsup” convergence since it uses both the weak and strong topologies on a topological vector space  X .  Mosco convergence is named after Italian  mathematician  Umberto Mosco , a current Harold J. Gay 1 professor of mathematics at Worcester Polytechnic Institute .  Definition  Let X be a topological vector space and let X ∗ denote the dual space of continuous linear functionals on X . Let F n : X → [0, +∞] be functionals on X for each n = 1, 2, ... The sequence (or, more generally, net ) ( F n ) is said to Mosco converge to another functional F : X → [0, +∞] if the following two conditions hold:   lower bound inequality: for each sequence of elements x n ∈ X  converging weakly to x ∈ X ,            lim inf   n  →  ∞      F  n    (   x  n   )     ≥   F   (  x  )     ;        subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n        subscript  F  n    subscript  x  n       F  x     \liminf_{n\to\infty}F_{n}(x_{n})\geq F(x);         upper bound inequality: for every x ∈ X there exists an approximating sequence of elements x n ∈ X , converging strongly to x , such that            lim sup   n  →  ∞      F  n    (   x  n   )     ≤   F   (  x  )     .        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-→  n        subscript  F  n    subscript  x  n       F  x     \limsup_{n\to\infty}F_{n}(x_{n})\leq F(x).        Since lower and upper bound inequalities of this type are used in the definition of Γ-convergence, Mosco convergence is sometimes phrased as “weak Γ-liminf and strong Γ-limsup” convergence. Mosco convergence is sometimes abbreviated to M-convergence and denoted by         M-lim   n  →  ∞     F  n    =   F  or   F  n     →   n  →  ∞   M   F   .          subscript  M-lim   normal-→  n      subscript  F  n      F  or   subscript  F  n        normal-→  n     normal-M  normal-→      F     \mathop{\text{M-lim}}_{n\to\infty}F_{n}=F\text{ or }F_{n}\xrightarrow[n\to%
