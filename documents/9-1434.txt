   Metric outer measure      Metric outer measure   In mathematics , a metric outer measure is an outer measure  μ defined on the subsets of a given metric space ( X , d ) such that       μ   (   A  ∪  B   )    =    μ   (  A  )    +   μ   (  B  )           μ    A  B        μ  A     μ  B      \mu(A\cup B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B)     for every pair of positively separated subsets A and B of X .  Construction of metric outer measures  Let τ : Σ → [0, +∞] be a set function defined on a class Σ of subsets of X containing the empty set ∅, such that τ (∅) = 0. One can show that the set function μ defined by        μ   (  E  )    =    lim   δ  →  0      μ  δ    (  E  )      ,        μ  E     subscript    normal-→  δ  0       subscript  μ  δ   E      \mu(E)=\lim_{\delta\to 0}\mu_{\delta}(E),   where         μ  δ    (  E  )    =   inf   {    ∑   i  =  1   ∞    τ   (   C  i   )     |     C  i   ∈  Σ   ,     diam   (   C  i   )    ≤  δ   ,     ⋃   i  =  1   ∞    C  i    ⊇  E     }     ,         subscript  μ  δ   E    infimum   conditional-set    superscript   subscript     i  1        τ   subscript  C  i      formulae-sequence     subscript  C  i   normal-Σ    formulae-sequence      diam   subscript  C  i    δ     E    superscript   subscript     i  1       subscript  C  i           \mu_{\delta}(E)=\inf\left\{\left.\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\tau(C_{i})\right|C_{i}\in%
 \Sigma,\mathrm{diam}(C_{i})\leq\delta,\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}C_{i}\supseteq E%
 \right\},     is not only an outer measure, but in fact a metric outer measure as well. (Some authors prefer to take a supremum over δ > 0 rather than a limit as δ → 0; the two give the same result, since μ δ ( E ) increases as δ decreases.)  For the function τ one can use        τ   (  C  )    =   diam    (  C  )   s     ,        τ  C     diam   superscript  C  s      \tau(C)=\mathrm{diam}(C)^{s},\,     where s is a positive constant; this τ is defined on the power set of all subsets of X ; the associated measure μ is the s -dimensional Hausdorff measure . More generally, one could use any so-called dimension function .  This construction is very important in fractal geometry , since this is how the Hausdorff and packing measures are obtained.  Properties of metric outer measures  Let μ be a metric outer measure on a metric space ( X , d ).   For any sequence of subsets A n , n ∈ N , of X with           A  1   ⊆   A  2   ⊆  …  ⊆  A  =    ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    A  n     ,         subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2        normal-…       A         superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n       A_{1}\subseteq A_{2}\subseteq\dots\subseteq A=\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n},         and such that A n and A \ A n +1 are positively separated, it follows that           μ   (  A  )    =    sup   n  ∈  ℕ     μ   (   A  n   )      .        μ  A     subscript  supremum    n  ℕ      μ   subscript  A  n       \mu(A)=\sup_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mu(A_{n}).         All the d - closed subsets  E of X are μ -measurable in the sense that they satisfy the following version of Carathéodory's criterion: for all sets A and B with A ⊆ E and B ⊆ X \ E ,           μ   (   A  ∪  B   )    =    μ   (  A  )    +   μ   (  B  )      .        μ    A  B        μ  A     μ  B      \mu(A\cup B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B).         Consequently, all the Borel subsets of X — those obtainable as countable unions, intersections and set-theoretic differences of open/closed sets — are μ -measurable.
