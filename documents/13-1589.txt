   Unibranch local ring      Unibranch local ring   In algebraic geometry , a local ring  A is said to be unibranch if the reduced ring  A red (obtained by quotienting A by its nilradical ) is an integral domain , and the integral closure  B of A red is also a local ring. A unibranch local ring is said to be geometrically unibranch if the residue field of B is a purely inseparable extension of the residue field of A red . A complex variety X is called topologically unibranch at a point x if for all complements Y of closed algebraic subsets of X there is a fundamental system of neighborhoods (in the classical topology) of x whose intersection with Y is connected.  In particular, a normal ring is unibranch. The notions of unibranch and geometrically unibranch points are used in some theorems in algebraic geometry. For example, there is the following result:  Theorem Let X and Y be two integral locally noetherian schemes and    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f\colon X\to Y   a proper  dominant morphism . Denote their function fields by K(X) and K(Y) , respectively. Suppose that the algebraic closure of K(Y) in K(X) has separable degree n and that    y  ∈  Y      y  Y    y\in Y   is unibranch. Then the fiber     f   -  1     (  y  )        superscript  f    1    y    f^{-1}(y)   has at most n connected components. In particular, if f is birational , then the fibers of unibranch points are connected.  In EGA, the theorem is obtained as a corollary of Zariski's main theorem .
