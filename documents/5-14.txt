Autocovariance

In probability and statistics, given a stochastic process

 
 , the autocovariance is a function that gives the covariance of the process with itself at pairs of time points. With the usual notation E  for the expectation operator, if the process has the mean function 
 
 
 
 , then the autocovariance is given by



Autocovariance is related to the more commonly used autocorrelation of the process in question.
In the case of a random vector 
 
 
 
 , the autocovariance would be a square n by n matrix 
 
 
 
  with entries 
 
 
 
  This is commonly known as the covariance matrix or matrix of covariances of the given random vector.
Stationarity
If X(t) is stationary process, then the following are true:


 
  for all t, s
and



where



is the lag time, or the amount of time by which the signal has been shifted.
As a result, the autocovariance becomes



















where 
 
 
 
  is the autocorrelation of the signal with variance 
 
 
 
 . Some authors do not normalize the autocorrelation function.1 In those literatures, 
 
 
 
 .
Normalization
When normalized by dividing by the variance σ2, the autocovariance C becomes the autocorrelation coefficient function c,2



However, often the autocovariance is called autocorrelation even if this normalization has not been performed.
The autocovariance can be thought of as a measure of how similar a signal is to a time-shifted version of itself with an autocovariance of σ2 indicating perfect correlation at that lag. The normalization with the variance will put this into the range [−1, 1].
