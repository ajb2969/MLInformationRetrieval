   Presentation of a monoid      Presentation of a monoid   In algebra , a presentation of a monoid (or semigroup ) is a description of a monoid (or semigroup ) in terms of a set Σ of generators and a set of relations on the free monoid Σ ∗ (or free semigroup Σ + ) generated by Σ. The monoid is then presented as the quotient of the free monoid by these relations. This is an analogue of a group presentation in group theory .  As a mathematical structure, a monoid presentation is identical to a string rewriting system (also known as semi-Thue system). Every monoid may be presented by a semi-Thue system (possibly over an infinite alphabet). 1  A presentation should not be confused with a representation .  Construction  The relations are given as a (finite) binary relation  R on Σ ∗ . To form the quotient monoid, these relations are extended to monoid congruences as follows.  First, one takes the symmetric closure R ∪ R −1 of R . This is then extended to a symmetric relation E ⊂ Σ ∗ × Σ ∗ by defining x ~ E  y if and only if x = sut and y = svt for some strings u , v , s , t ∈ Σ ∗ with ( u , v ) ∈ R ∪ R −1 . Finally, one takes the reflexive and transitive closure of E , which is then a monoid congruence.  In the typical situation, the relation R is simply given as a set of equations, so that    R  =   {   u  1   =   v  1   ,  ⋯  ,   u  n   =   v  n   }      fragments  R    fragments  normal-{   subscript  u  1     subscript  v  1   normal-,  normal-⋯  normal-,   subscript  u  n     subscript  v  n   normal-}     R=\{u_{1}=v_{1},\cdots,u_{n}=v_{n}\}   . Thus, for example,      ⟨   p  ,   q    |    p  q   =  1   ⟩     inner-product   p  q       p  q   1     \langle p,q\,|\;pq=1\rangle   is the equational presentation for the bicyclic monoid , and      ⟨   a  ,   b    |     a  b  a   =   b  a  a    ,    b  b  a   =   b  a  b     ⟩     inner-product   a  b    formulae-sequence      a  b  a     b  a  a        b  b  a     b  a  b       \langle a,b\,|\;aba=baa,bba=bab\rangle   is the plactic monoid of degree 2 (it has infinite order). Elements of this plactic monoid may be written as     a  i    b  j     (   b  a   )   k        superscript  a  i    superscript  b  j    superscript    b  a   k     a^{i}b^{j}(ba)^{k}   for integers i , j , k , as the relations show that ba commutes with both a and b .  Inverse monoids and semigroups  Presentations of inverse monoids and semigroups can be defined in a similar way using a pair      (  X  ;  T  )     X  T    (X;T)   where       (   X  ∪   X   -  1     )   *     superscript    X   superscript  X    1        (X\cup X^{-1})^{*}     is the free monoid with involution on   X   X   X   , and      T  ⊆     (   X  ∪   X   -  1     )   *   ×    (   X  ∪   X   -  1     )   *        T     superscript    X   superscript  X    1        superscript    X   superscript  X    1          T\subseteq(X\cup X^{-1})^{*}\times(X\cup X^{-1})^{*}     is a binary relation between words. We denote by    T  e     superscript  T  normal-e    T^{\mathrm{e}}   (respectively    T  c     superscript  T  normal-c    T^{\mathrm{c}}   ) the equivalence relation (respectively, the congruence ) generated by T .  We use this pair of objects to define an inverse monoid        Inv  1    ⟨  X  |  T  ⟩    .       superscript  Inv  1    inner-product  X  T     \mathrm{Inv}^{1}\langle X|T\rangle.     Let    ρ  X     subscript  ρ  X    \rho_{X}   be the Wagner congruence on   X   X   X   , we define the inverse monoid       Inv  1    ⟨  X  |  T  ⟩        superscript  Inv  1    inner-product  X  T     \mathrm{Inv}^{1}\langle X|T\rangle     presented by    (  X  ;  T  )     X  T    (X;T)   as         Inv  1    ⟨  X  |  T  ⟩    =     (   X  ∪   X   -  1     )   *   /    (   T  ∪   ρ  X    )   c     .         superscript  Inv  1    inner-product  X  T       superscript    X   superscript  X    1        superscript    T   subscript  ρ  X    normal-c      \mathrm{Inv}^{1}\langle X|T\rangle=(X\cup X^{-1})^{*}/(T\cup\rho_{X})^{\mathrm%
 {c}}.     In the previous discussion, if we replace everywhere     (   X  ∪   X   -  1     )   *     superscript    X   superscript  X    1        ({X\cup X^{-1}})^{*}   with     (   X  ∪   X   -  1     )   +     superscript    X   superscript  X    1        ({X\cup X^{-1}})^{+}   we obtain a presentation (for an inverse semigroup)     (  X  ;  T  )     X  T    (X;T)   and an inverse semigroup    Inv   ⟨  X  |  T  ⟩       Inv   inner-product  X  T     \mathrm{Inv}\langle X|T\rangle    presented by    (  X  ;  T  )     X  T    (X;T)   .  A trivial but important example is the free inverse monoid (or free inverse semigroup ) on   X   X   X   , that is usually denoted by    FIM   (  X  )       FIM  X    \mathrm{FIM}(X)   (respectively    FIS   (  X  )       FIS  X    \mathrm{FIS}(X)   ) and is defined by        FIM   (  X  )    =    Inv  1    ⟨  X  |  ∅  ⟩    =     (   X  ∪   X   -  1     )   *   /   ρ  X     ,          FIM  X      superscript  Inv  1    inner-product  X             superscript    X   superscript  X    1        subscript  ρ  X       \mathrm{FIM}(X)=\mathrm{Inv}^{1}\langle X|\varnothing\rangle=({X\cup X^{-1}})^%
