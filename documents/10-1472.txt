   FMN reductase      FMN reductase   In enzymology , an FMN reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   FMNH 2 + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   FMN + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are FMNH2 , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are FMN , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is FMNH2:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NAD(P)H-FMN reductase , NAD(P)H-dependent FMN reductase , NAD(P)H:FMN oxidoreductase , NAD(P)H:flavin oxidoreductase , NAD(P)H2 dehydrogenase (FMN) , NAD(P)H2:FMN oxidoreductase , SsuE , riboflavin mononucleotide reductase , flavine mononucleotide reductase , riboflavin mononucleotide (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , (phosphate)) reductase , flavin mononucleotide reductase , and riboflavine mononucleotide reductase .
