Orthogonal projections in B 6  Coxeter plane |} In six-dimensional geometry , a rectified 6-orthoplex is a convex uniform 6-polytope , being a rectification of the regular 6-orthoplex .  There are unique 6 degrees of rectifications, the zeroth being the 6-orthoplex , and the 6th and last being the 6-cube . Vertices of the rectified 6-orthoplex are located at the edge-centers of the 6-orthoplex. Vertices of the birectified 6-orthoplex are located in the triangular face centers of the 6-orthoplex.

Cartesian coordinates  Cartesian coordinates for the vertices of a rectified hexacross, centered at the origin, edge length    2      2    \sqrt{2}   are all permutations of:   (±1,±1,0,0,0,0)   Root vectors  The 60 vertices represent the root vectors of the simple Lie group D 6 . The vertices can be seen in 3 hyperplanes , with the 15 vertices rectified 5-simplexs cells on opposite sides, and 30 vertices of an expanded 5-simplex passing through the center. When combined with the 12 vertices of the 6-orthoplex, these vertices represent the 72 root vectors of the B 6 and C 6 simple Lie groups.
