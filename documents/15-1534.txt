   7-Dimethylallyltryptophan synthase      7-Dimethylallyltryptophan synthase   7-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase (, 7-DMATS ) is an enzyme with system name dimethylallyl-diphosphate:L-tryptophan 7-dimethylallyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   dimethylallyl diphosphate + L- tryptophan    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + 7-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-L-tryptophan   This enzyme is more flexible towards the aromatic substrate than EC 2.5.1.34 (4-dimethylallyltryptophan synthase).
