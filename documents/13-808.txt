   Decisional composite residuosity assumption      Decisional composite residuosity assumption   The decisional composite residuosity assumption (DCRA) is a mathematical assumption used in cryptography . In particular, the assumption is used in the proof of the Paillier cryptosystem .  Informally the DCRA states that given a composite  n and an integer  z , it is hard to decide whether z is a n -residue modulo  n 2 or not, i.e., whether there exists y such that       z  â‰¡    y  n      (   mod   n  2    )     .      z   annotated   superscript  y  n    pmod   superscript  n  2       z\equiv y^{n}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n^{2}).\,     See also   Computational hardness assumption  Quadratic residuosity problem  Higher residuosity problem   References   P.
