   Myhill isomorphism theorem      Myhill isomorphism theorem   In computability theory the Myhill isomorphism theorem , named after John Myhill , provides a characterization for two numberings to induce the same notion of computability on a set.  Myhill isomorphism theorem  Sets A and B of natural numbers are said to be recursively isomorphic if there is a total  computable  bijection  f from the set of natural numbers to itself such that f ( A ) = B .  A set A of natural numbers is said to be one-one reducible to a set B if there is a total computable injection f on the natural numbers such that     f   (  A  )    ⊆  B        f  A   B    f(A)\subseteq B   and     f   (   ℕ  ∖  A   )    ⊆   ℕ  ∖  B         f    ℕ  A      ℕ  B     f(\mathbb{N}\setminus A)\subseteq\mathbb{N}\setminus B   .  Myhill's isomorphism theorem states that two sets A and B of natural numbers are recursively isomorphic if and only if A is one-reducible to B and B is one-reducible to A . The theorem is proved by an effective version of the argument used for the Schroeder–Bernstein theorem .  A corollary of Myhill's theorem is that two total numberings are one-equivalent if and only if they are computably isomorphic .  References    .   .   "  Category:Computability theory
