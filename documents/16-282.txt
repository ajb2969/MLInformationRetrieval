Tetrahydrosarcinapterin synthase

Tetrahydrosarcinapterin synthase (, H4MPT:alpha-L-glutamate ligase, MJ0620, MptN protein) is an enzyme with system name tetrahydromethanopterin:alpha-L-glutamate ligase (ADP-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + tetrahydromethanopterin + L-glutamate

 
  ADP + phosphate + 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrosarcinapterin
 

This enzyme catalyses the biosynthesis of 5,6,7,8-tetrahydrosarcinapterin.
