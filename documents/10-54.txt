   Multipliers and centralizers (Banach spaces)      Multipliers and centralizers (Banach spaces)   In mathematics , multipliers and centralizers are algebraic objects in the study of Banach spaces . They are used, for example, in generalizations of the Banach-Stone theorem .  Definitions  Let ( X , ||·||) be a Banach space over a field K (either the real or complex numbers ), and let Ext( X ) be the set of extreme points of the closed unit ball of the continuous dual space  X ∗ .  A continuous linear operator  T : X → X is said to be a multiplier if every point p in Ext( X ) is an eigenvector for the adjoint operator  T ∗ : X ∗ → X ∗ . That is, there exists a function a T : Ext( X ) → K such that        p  ∘  T   =    a  T    (  p  )   p  for all  p   ∈   Ext   (  X  )     ,          p  T      subscript  a  T   p  p  for all  p          Ext  X      p\circ T=a_{T}(p)p\mbox{ for all }p\in\mathrm{Ext}(X),     making     a  T    (  p  )        subscript  a  T   p    a_{T}(p)   the eigenvalue corresponding to p . Given two multipliers S and T on X , S is said to be an adjoint for T if        a  S   =    a  T   ¯    ,       subscript  a  S    normal-¯   subscript  a  T      a_{S}=\overline{a_{T}},     i.e. a S agrees with a T in the real case, and with the complex conjugate of a T in the complex case.  The centralizer of X , denoted Z ( X ), is the set of all multipliers on X for which an adjoint exists.  Properties   The multiplier adjoint of a multiplier T , if it exists, is unique; the unique adjoint of T is denoted T ∗ .  If the field K is the real numbers, then every multiplier on X lies in the centralizer of X .   References      "  Category:Banach spaces  Category:Operator theory
