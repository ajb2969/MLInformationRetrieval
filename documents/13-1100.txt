   Effective Polish space      Effective Polish space   In mathematical logic , an effective Polish space is a complete  separable  metric space that has a computable presentation . Such spaces are studied in effective descriptive set theory and in constructive analysis . In particular, standard examples of Polish spaces such as the real line , the Cantor set and the Baire space are all effective Polish spaces.  Definition  An effective Polish space is a complete separable metric space X with metric d such that there is a countable dense set C = ( c 0 , c 1 ,...) that makes the following two relations on    ℕ  4     superscript  ℕ  4    \mathbb{N}^{4}   computable (Moschovakis 2009:96-7):       P   (  i  ,  j  ,  k  ,  m  )    ≡   d   (   c  i   ,   c  j   )    ≤   m   k  +  1            P   i  j  k  m      d    subscript  c  i    subscript  c  j            m    k  1       P(i,j,k,m)\equiv d(c_{i},c_{j})\leq\frac{m}{k+1}          Q   (  i  ,  j  ,  k  ,  m  )    ≡   d   (   c  i   ,   c  j   )    <   m   k  +  1            Q   i  j  k  m      d    subscript  c  i    subscript  c  j            m    k  1       Q(i,j,k,m)\equiv d(c_{i},c_{j})<\frac{m}{k+1}     References   Yiannis N.
