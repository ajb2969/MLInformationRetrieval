   Luteolin-7-O-diglucuronide 4'-O-glucuronosyltransferase      Luteolin-7-O-diglucuronide 4'-O-glucuronosyltransferase   In enzymology , a luteolin-7-O-diglucuronide 4'-O-glucuronosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucuronate + luteolin 7-O-beta-D-diglucuronide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + luteolin 7-O-[beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucuronide]-4'-O-beta-D- glucuronide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucuronate and luteolin 7-O-beta-D-diglucuronide , whereas its 4 products are UDP , luteolin , [[7-O-[beta-D-glucuronosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucuronide]-4'-O-beta-D-]], and glucuronide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucuronate:luteolin-7-O-beta-D-diglucuronide 4'-O-glucuronosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucuronate-luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide , glucuronosyltransferase , UDP-glucuronate:luteolin 7-O-diglucuronide-glucuronosyltransferase , UDPglucuronate:luteolin , 7-O-diglucuronide-4'-O-glucuronosyl-transferase , and LDT .
