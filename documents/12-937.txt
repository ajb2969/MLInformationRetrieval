   Haloform reaction      Haloform reaction   The haloform reaction is a chemical reaction where a haloform (CHX 3 , where X is a halogen ) is produced by the exhaustive halogenation of a methyl ketone (a molecule containing the R–CO–CH 3 group) in the presence of a base . 1 R may be alkyl or aryl . The reaction can be used to produce chloroform (CHCl 3 ), bromoform (CHBr 3 ), or iodoform (CHI 3 ).  (Figure)  Haloform reaction scheme   Scope  Substrates that successfully undergo the haloform reaction are methyl ketones and secondary alcohols oxidizable to methyl ketones, such as isopropanol . The only primary alcohol and aldehyde to undergo this reaction are ethanol and ethanal , respectively. 1,3-Diketones such as acetylacetone also give the haloform reaction. β-ketoacids such as acetoacetic acid will also give the test upon heating. Acetyl chloride and acetamide don't give this test. The halogen used may be chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Fluoroform (CHF 3 ) cannot be prepared from a methyl ketone by the haloform reaction due to the instability of hypofluorite , but compounds of the type RCOCF 3 do cleave with base to produce fluoroform; this is equivalent to the second and third steps in the process shown above.  Mechanism  In the first step, the halogen disproportionates in the presence of hydroxide to give the halide and hypohalite (example with bromine, but reaction is the same in case of chlorine and iodine; one should only substitute Br for Cl or I):         Br  2   +   2    OH  -      →    Br  -   +   BrO  -   +    H  2   O       normal-→     subscript  Br  2     2   superscript  OH         superscript  Br     superscript  BrO       subscript  H  2   O      \mbox{Br}_{2}+2\mbox{OH}^{{}-{}}~{}\rightarrow~{}\mbox{Br}^{{}-{}}+\mbox{BrO}^%

The enolate undergoes electrophilic attack by the hypohalite (containing a halogen with a formal +1 charge).        (2) When the α position has been exhaustively halogenated, the molecule undergoes a nucleophilic acyl substitution by hydroxide, with − CX 3 being the leaving group stabilized by three electron-withdrawing groups . In the third step the − CX 3 anion abstracts a proton from either the solvent or the carboxylic acid formed in the previous step, and forms the haloform.            (Figure)  Haloform startAnimGif      animation       Uses  This reaction was traditionally used as a chemical test for qualitative organic analysis to determine the presence of a methyl ketone, or a secondary alcohol oxidizable to a methyl ketone through the iodoform test . Nowadays, spectroscopic techniques such as NMR and infrared are easy and quick to perform instead of qualitative tests. Iodoform reaction is used as test reaction of ethyl alcohol in given sample of alcohols.  It was formerly used to produce iodoform, bromoform, and even chloroform industrially.  In organic chemistry , this reaction may be used to convert a terminal methyl ketone into the analogous carboxylic acid.  Iodoform test  When iodine and sodium hydroxide are used as the reagents, a positive reaction gives iodoform. Iodoform (CHI 3 ) is a pale-yellow substance. Due to its high molar mass caused by the three iodine atoms, it is solid at room temperature (cf. chloroform and bromoform). It is insoluble in water and has an antiseptic smell. A visible precipitate of this compound will form from a sample only when either a methyl ketone, ethanal, ethanol, or a methyl secondary alcohol is present.  History  The haloform reaction is one of the oldest organic reactions known. 2 In 1822, Serullas added potassium metal to a solution of iodine in ethanol and water to form potassium formate and iodoform, called in the language of that time hydroiodide of carbon . 3 In 1831, Justus von Liebig reported the reaction of chloral with calcium hydroxide to form chloroform and calcium formate. The reaction was rediscovered by Adolf Lieben in 1870. The iodoform test is also called the Lieben haloform reaction . A review of the Haloform reaction with a history section was published in 1934. 4  Byproducts  If NaOH is used as the base, then three equivalents of water and three equivalents of NaX will also be produced.
