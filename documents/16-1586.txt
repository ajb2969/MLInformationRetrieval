   Semi-simplicity      Semi-simplicity   In mathematics, semi-simplicity is a widespread concept in disciplines such as linear algebra , abstract algebra , representation theory , category theory and algebraic geometry . A semi-simple object is one that can be decomposed into a sum of simple objects, and simple objects are those which do not contain non-trivial sub-objects. The precise definitions of these words depends on the context.  For example, if G is a finite group , then a finite-dimensional representation  V over a field is said to be simple if the only subrepresentations it contains are either {0} or V (these are also called irreducible representations ). Then Maschke's theorem says that any finite-dimensional representation is a direct sum of simple representations (provided the characteristic does not divide the order of the group). So, in this case, every representation of a finite group is semi-simple . Especially in algebra and representation theory, "semi-simplicity" is also called complete reducibility . For example, Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility says a finite-dimensional representation of a semisimple compact Lie group is semisimple.  A square matrix (in other words a linear operator    T  :   V  →  V      normal-:  T   normal-→  V  V     T:V\to V   with V finite dimensional vector space) is said to be simple if the only subspaces which are invariant under T are {0} and V . If the field is algebraically closed (such as the complex numbers ), then the only simple matrices are of size 1 by 1. A semi-simple matrix is one that is similar to a direct sum of simple matrices ; if the field is algebraically closed, this is the same as being diagonalizable .  These notions of semi-simplicity can be unified using the language of semi-simple modules , and generalized to semi-simple categories .  Introductory example of vector spaces  If one considers all vector spaces (over a field , such as the real numbers), the simple vector spaces are those which contain no proper subspaces. Therefore, the one- dimensional vector spaces are the simple ones. So it is a basic result of linear algebra that any finite-dimensional vector space is the direct sum of simple vector spaces; in other words, all finite-dimensional vector spaces are semi-simple.  Semi-simple modules and rings  For a fixed ring  R , an R -module M is simple, if it has no submodules other than 0 and M . The module M is semi-simple if it is the direct sum of simple modules. Finally, R is called a semi-simple ring if it is semi-simple as an R -module. As it turns out, this is equivalent to requiring that any finitely generated  R -module M is semi-simple. 1  Examples of semi-simple rings include fields and, more generally, finite direct products of fields. For a finite group G  Maschke's theorem asserts that the group ring  R [ G ] over some ring R is semi-simple if and only if R is semi-simple and | G | is invertible in R . Since the theory of modules of R [ G ] is the same as the representation theory of G on R -modules, this fact is an important dichotomy, which causes modular representation theory , i.e., the case when | G | does divide the characteristic of R to be more difficult than the case when | G | does not divide the characteristic, in particular if R is a field of characteristic zero. By the Artin–Wedderburn theorem , a unital Artinian ring R is semisimple if and only if it is (isomorphic to)         M  n    (   D  1   )    ×   M  n     (   D  2   )    ×  ⋯  ×   M  n     (   D  r   )                subscript  M  n    subscript  D  1     subscript  M  n     subscript  D  2    normal-⋯   subscript  M  n     subscript  D  r     M_{n}(D_{1})\times M_{n}(D_{2})\times\cdots\times M_{n}(D_{r})   , where each    D  i     subscript  D  i    D_{i}   is a division ring and     M  n    (  D  )        subscript  M  n   D    M_{n}(D)   is the ring of n -by- n matrices with entries in D .  As indicated above, the theory of semi-simple rings is much more easy than the one of general rings. For example, any short exact sequence      0  →   M  ′   →  M  →   M  ′′   →  0       normal-→  0   superscript  M  normal-′     normal-→    M    normal-→     superscript  M  ′′     normal-→    0     0\to M^{\prime}\to M\to M^{\prime\prime}\to 0   of modules over a semi-simple ring must split, i.e.,    M  ≅    M  ′   ⊕   M  ′′        M   direct-sum   superscript  M  normal-′    superscript  M  ′′      M\cong M^{\prime}\oplus M^{\prime\prime}   . From the point of view of homological algebra , this means that there are no non-trivial extensions . The ring Z of integers is not semi-simple: Z is not the direct sum of n Z and Z / n .  Semi-simple matrices  A matrix or, equivalently, a linear operator  T on a finite-dimensional vector space  V is called semi-simple if every T - invariant subspace has a complementary  T -invariant subspace. 2 3 This is equivalent to the minimal polynomial of T being square-free.  For vector spaces over an algebraically closed field F , semi-simplicity of a matrix is equivalent to diagonalizability . 4 This is because such an operator always has an eigenvector; if it is, in addition, semi-simple, then it has a complementary invariant hyperplane , which itself has an eigenvector, and thus by induction is diagonalizable. Conversely, diagonalizable operators are easily seen to be semi-simple, as invariant subspaces are direct sums of eigenspaces, and any basis for this space can be extended to an eigenbasis.  Actually this notion of semi-simplicity is a special case of the one of rings: T is semi-simple if and only if the subalgebra     F   [  T  ]    ⊂    End  F    (  V  )          F   delimited-[]  T      subscript  End  F   V     F[T]\subset\operatorname{End}_{F}(V)   generated by the powers (i.e., iterations) of T inside the ring of endomorphisms of V is semi-simple.  Semi-simple categories  Many of the above notions of semi-simplicity are recovered by the concept of a semi-simple category C . Briefly, a category is a collection of objects and maps between such objects, the idea being that the maps between the objects preserve some structure inherent in these objects. For example, R -modules and R -linear maps between them form a category, for any ring R .  An abelian category 5  C is called semi-simple if there is a collection of simple objects     X  α   ∈  C       subscript  X  α   C    X_{\alpha}\in C   , i.e., ones which have no subobject other than the zero object 0 and    X  α     subscript  X  α    X_{\alpha}   itself, such that any object X is the direct sum (i.e., coproduct or, equivalently, product) of simple objects.  With this terminology, a ring R is semi-simple if and only if the category of finitely generated R -modules is semisimple. An example from Hodge theory is the category of polarizable pure Hodge structures , i.e., pure Hodge structures equipped with a suitable positive definite bilinear. The presence of this so-called polarization causes the category of polarizable Hodge structures to be semi-simple. 6 Another example from algebraic geometry is the category of pure motives of smooth  projective varieties over a field k     Mot    (  k  )   ∼      fragments  Mot   subscript   fragments  normal-(  k  normal-)   similar-to     \operatorname{Mot}(k)_{\sim}   modulo an adequate equivalence relation    ∼   similar-to   \sim   . As was conjectured by Grothendieck and shown by Jannsen , this category is semi-simple if and only if the equivalence relation is numerical equivalence . 7 This fact is a conceptual cornerstone in the theory of motives.  Semi-simplicity in representation theory  One can ask whether the category of (say, finite-dimensional) representations of a group G is semisimple or not (in such a category, irreducible representations are precisely simple objects). For example, the category is semisimple if G is a semisimple  compact Lie group ( Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility ).  See also: fusion category (which is semisimple).  See also   A semisimple Lie algebra is a Lie algebra that is a direct sum of simple Lie algebras.  A semisimple algebraic group is a linear algebraic group whose radical of the identity component is trivial.
