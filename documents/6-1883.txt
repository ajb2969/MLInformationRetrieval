   Whitehead product      Whitehead product   In mathematics, the Whitehead product is a graded  quasi-Lie algebra structure on the homotopy groups of a space. It was defined by J. H. C. Whitehead in .  Definition  Given elements $f \in \pi_k(X), g \in \pi_l(X)$ , the Whitehead bracket  $$[f,g] \in \pi_{k+l-1}(X) \,$$  is defined as follows:  The product $S^k \times S^l$ can be obtained by attaching a $(k+l)$ -cell to the wedge sum  $$S^k \vee S^l$$ ;  the attaching map is a map  $$S^{k+l-1} \to S^k \vee S^l. \,$$  Represent $f$ and $g$ by maps  $$f\colon S^k \to X \,$$  and  $$g\colon S^l \to X, \,$$  then compose their wedge with the attaching map, as  $$S^{k+l-1} \to S^k \vee S^l \to X \,$$  The homotopy class of the resulting map does not depend on the choices of representatives, and thus one obtains a well-defined element of  $$\pi_{k+l-1}(X). \,$$  Grading  Note that there is a shift of 1 in the grading (compared to the indexing of homotopy groups ), so $\pi_k(X)$ has degree $(k-1)$ ; equivalently, $L_k = \pi_{k+1}(X)$ (setting L to be the graded quasi-Lie algebra). Thus $L_0 = \pi_1(X)$ acts on each graded component.  Properties  The Whitehead product is bilinear, graded-symmetric, and satisfies the graded Jacobi identity , and is thus a graded  quasi-Lie algebra ; this is proven in  via the Massey triple product .  If $f \in \pi_1(X)$ , then the Whitehead bracket is related to the usual conjugation action of $\pi_1$ on $\pi_k$ by  $$[f,g]=g^f-g, \,$$  where $g^f$ denotes the conjugation of $g$ by $f$ . For $k=1$ , this reduces to  $$[f,g]=fgf^{-1}g^{-1}, \,$$  which is the usual commutator.  The relevant MSC code is: 55Q15, Whitehead products and generalizations.
