Dendrite (mathematics)

In mathematics, a dendrite is a certain type of topological space that may be characterized either as a locally connected dendroid or equivalently as a locally connected continuum that contains no simple closed curves.1
 Dendrites may be used to model certain types of Julia set.2 For example, if 0 is pre-periodic, but not periodic, under the function 
 
 
 
 , then the Julia set of 
 
 
 
  is a dendrite.3
