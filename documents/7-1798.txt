   MIDI Tuning Standard      MIDI Tuning Standard   MIDI Tuning Standard (MTS) is a specification of precise musical pitch agreed to by the MIDI Manufacturers Association in the MIDI protocol. MTS allows for both a bulk tuning dump message, giving a tuning for each of 128 notes , and a tuning message for individual notes as they are played.  Frequency values  If ƒ is a frequency , then the corresponding frequency data value d may be computed by       d  =   69  +   12    log  2    (   f    440   Hz    )       .      d    69    12    subscript   2     f    440  Hz         d=69+12\log_{2}\left(\frac{f}{440\ \mathrm{Hz}}\right).\,     The quantity log 2 ( ƒ / 440 Hz) is the number of octaves above the 440-Hz concert A (it is negative if the frequency is below that pitch). Multiplying it by 12 gives the number of semitones above that frequency. Adding 69 gives the number of semitones above the C five octaves below middle C .  Since 440 Hz is a widely used standard concert A (e.g. USA, UK), and since that is represented in MIDI terms by the integer 69 (nine semitones above middle C, which is 60), this gives a real number which expresses pitch in a manner consistent with MIDI and integer notation , known as the midi note number.  Converting from midi note number (d) to frequency (f) is given by the following formula:      f  =     2    (   d  -  69   )   /  12    ⋅   440     Hz        f     normal-⋅   superscript  2      d  69   12    440   Hz     f=2^{(d-69)/12}\cdot 440\ \mathrm{Hz}\,     Frequency Data Format  The frequency data format allows for the precise notation of frequencies that differ from equal temperament .  "Frequency data shall be defined in [units] which are fractions of a semitone. The frequency range starts at MIDI note 0, C = 8.1758 Hz, and extends above MIDI note 127, G = 12543.875 Hz. The first byte of the frequency data word specifies the highest equal-tempered semitone not exceeding the frequency. The next two bytes (14 bits) specify the fraction of 100 cents above the semitone at which the frequency lies. Effective resolution = 100 cents / 2 14 = .0061 cents." 1  This higher resolution allows a logarithmic representation of pitch in which the semitone is divided into 128 2 = 2 14 = 16384 parts, which means the octave is divided into 196608 (logarithmically) equal parts. These parts are exactly 100/16384 cents (approximately 0.0061 cents) in size, which is far below the threshold of human pitch perception and which therefore allows a very accurate representation of pitch.  Applications  The precision pitch values may be used in microtonal music , just intonation , meantone temperament , or other alternative tunings. Software which supports MTS includes Scala , TiMidity++ , alt-tuner , L'il Miss Scale Oven , Tune Smithy , Max Magic Microtuner , Gervill , and Relayer . Software plugin instruments which support MTS include Pianoteq , Native Instruments FM8, Synthogy Ivory, and Xen-Arts' various xenharmonic VSTi plugins, including the FMTS FM synthesizer, Ivor virtual analog synthesizer, and XenFont SoundFont sample player.
