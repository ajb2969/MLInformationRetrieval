   Deoxynucleotide 3'-phosphatase      Deoxynucleotide 3'-phosphatase   In enzymology , a deoxynucleotide 3'-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a deoxynucleoside 3'-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a deoxynucleoside + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are deoxynucleoside 3'-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are deoxynucleoside and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deoxyribonucleotide 3'-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include 3'-deoxynucleotidase , and 3'-deoxyribonucleotidase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
