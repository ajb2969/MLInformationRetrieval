   EHP spectral sequence      EHP spectral sequence   In mathematics , the EHP spectral sequence is a spectral sequence used for inductively calculating the homotopy groups of spheres localized at some prime  p . It is described in more detail in  and . It is related to the EHP long exact sequence of ; the name "EHP" comes from the fact that Whitehead named 3 of the maps of his sequence "E" (the first letter of the German word "Einhängung" meaning "suspension"), "H" (for Hopf, as this map is the second Hopf-James invariant), and "P" (related to (Whitehead) products).  For p = 2 the spectral sequence uses some exact sequences associated to the fibration        S  n    (  2  )    →   Ω   S   n  +  1     (  2  )    →   Ω   S    2  n   +  1     (  2  )         normal-→     superscript  S  n   2     normal-Ω   superscript  S    n  1    2     normal-→      normal-Ω   superscript  S      2  n   1    2      S^{n}(2)\rightarrow\Omega S^{n+1}(2)\rightarrow\Omega S^{2n+1}(2)   (where Ω stands for a loop space and the (2) is localization of a topological space at the prime 2). This gives a spectral sequence with E 1 k , n term π k + n ( S 2 n −1 (2)) and converging to π * S (2) (stable homotopy of spheres localized at 2). The spectral sequence has the advantage that the input is previously calculated homotopy groups. It was used by  to calculate the first 31 stable homotopy groups of spheres.  For arbitrary primes one uses some fibrations found by :         S  ^    2  n     (  p  )    →   Ω   S    2  n   +  1     (  p  )    →   Ω   S    2  p  n   +  1     (  p  )         normal-→     superscript   normal-^  S     2  n    p     normal-Ω   superscript  S      2  n   1    p     normal-→      normal-Ω   superscript  S      2  p  n   1    p      \widehat{S}^{2n}(p)\rightarrow\Omega S^{2n+1}(p)\rightarrow\Omega S^{2pn+1}(p)           S    2  n   -  1     (  p  )    →   Ω    S  ^    2  n     (  p  )    →   Ω   S    2  p  n   -  1     (  p  )         normal-→     superscript  S      2  n   1    p     normal-Ω   superscript   normal-^  S     2  n    p     normal-→      normal-Ω   superscript  S      2  p  n   1    p      S^{2n-1}(p)\rightarrow\Omega\widehat{S}^{2n}(p)\rightarrow\Omega S^{2pn-1}(p)   where     S  ^    2  n      superscript   normal-^  S     2  n     \widehat{S}^{2n}   is the 2 np − 1 skeleton of the loop space    Ω   S    2  n   +  1        normal-Ω   superscript  S      2  n   1      \Omega S^{2n+1}   . (For p = 2,     S  ^    2  n      superscript   normal-^  S     2  n     \widehat{S}^{2n}   is the same as    S   2  n      superscript  S    2  n     S^{2n}   , so Toda's fibrations at p = 2 are the same as the James fibrations.)
