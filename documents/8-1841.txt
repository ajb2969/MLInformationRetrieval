   Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation      Hubbard–Stratonovich transformation   The Hubbard–Stratonovich (HS) transformation is an exact mathematical  transformation invented by Russian physicist Ruslan L. Stratonovich and popularized by British physicist John Hubbard . It is used to convert a particle theory into its respective field theory by linearizing the density operator in the many-body interaction term of the Hamiltonian and introducing a scalar auxiliary field. It is defined via the integral identity 1  2        exp   {   -    a  2    x  2     }    =      1   2  π  a        ∫   -  ∞   ∞     exp   [    -    y  2    2  a     -   i  x  y    ]    d  y      ,              a  2    superscript  x  2            1    2  π  a       superscript   subscript                     superscript  y  2     2  a       i  x  y     d  y       \exp\left\{-\frac{a}{2}x^{2}\right\}=\sqrt{\frac{1}{2\pi a}}\;\int_{-\infty}^{%
 \infty}\exp\left[-\frac{y^{2}}{2a}-ixy\right]\,dy,     where the real constant    a  >  0      a  0    a>0   . The basic idea of the HS transformation is to reformulate a system of particles interacting through two-body potentials into a system of independent particles interacting with a fluctuating field. The procedure is widely used in polymer physics , classical particle physics, spin glass theory , and electronic structure theory.  Calculation of resulting field theories  The resulting field theories are well-suited for the application of effective approximation techniques, like the mean field approximation. A major difficulty arising in the simulation with such field theories is their highly oscillatory nature in case of strong interactions, which leads to the well-known numerical sign problem . The problem originates from the repulsive part of the interaction potential, which implicates the introduction of the complex factor via the HS transformation.
