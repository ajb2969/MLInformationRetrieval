   L-stability      L-stability   L-stability is a special case of A-stability , a property of Runge–Kutta methods for solving ordinary differential equations . A method is L-stable if it is A-stable and     ϕ   (  z  )    →  0     normal-→    ϕ  z   0    \phi(z)\to 0   as    z  →  ∞     normal-→  z     z\to\infty   , where   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the stability function of the method (the stability function of a Runge–Kutta method is a rational function and thus the limit as    z  →   +  ∞      normal-→  z        z\to+\infty   is the same as the limit as    z  →   -  ∞      normal-→  z        z\to-\infty   ). L-stable methods are in general very good at integrating stiff equations .  References    .   "  Category:Numerical differential equations
