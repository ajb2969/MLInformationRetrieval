L-stability

L-stability is a special case of  A-stability, a property of Runge–Kutta methods for solving ordinary differential equations. A method is L-stable if it is  A-stable and 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the stability function of the method (the stability function of a Runge–Kutta method is a rational function and thus the limit as 
 
 
 
  is the same as the limit as 
 
 
 
 ). L-stable methods are in general very good at integrating stiff equations.
