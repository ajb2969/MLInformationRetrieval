Pythagorean means

  In mathematics, the three classical Pythagorean means are the arithmetic mean (A), the geometric mean (G), and the harmonic mean (H). They are defined by:











Each mean has the following properties:

Value preservation
 
 

First order homogeneity


Invariance under exchange
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Averaging
 
 


These means were studied with proportions by Pythagoreans and later generations of Greek mathematicians (Thomas Heath, History of Ancient Greek Mathematics) because of their importance in geometry and music. The harmonic and arithmetic means are reciprocal duals of each other for positive arguments (
 
 
 
 ) while the geometric mean is its own reciprocal dual.
Inequalities among means
There is an ordering to these means (if all of the 
 
 
 
  are positive)


 
  with equality holding if and only if the 
 
 
 
  are all equal. This is a generalization of the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means and a special case of an inequality for generalized means. The proof follows from the artithmetic-geometric mean inequality, 
 
 
 
 
 , and reciprocal duality (
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are also reciprocal dual to each other).
The study of the pythagorean means is closely related to the study of majorization and Schur-convex functions. The harmonic and geometric means are concave symmetric functions of their arguments, and hence Schur-concave, while the arithmetic mean is a linear function of its arguments, so both concave and convex.
