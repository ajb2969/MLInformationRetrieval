   Joule per mole      Joule per mole   The joule per mole (symbol: J·mol −1 ) is an SI derived unit of energy per amount of material. Energy is measured in joules , and the amount of material is measured in moles . For example, Gibbs free energy is quantified as joules per mole.  Since 1 mole = 6.02214×10 23 particles (atoms, molecules, ions etc.), 1 Joule per mole is equal to 1 Joule divided by 6.02214×10 23 particles, or 1.66054×10 −24 Joule per particle. This very small amount of energy is often expressed in terms of a smaller unit such as the electronvolt (eV, see below).  Physical quantities measured in J·mol −1 usually describe quantities of energy transferred during phase transformations or chemical reactions . Division by the number of moles facilitates comparison between processes involving different quantities of material and between similar processes involving different types of materials. The meaning of such a quantity is always context-dependent and, particularly for chemical reactions, is dependent on the (possibly arbitrary) definition of a 'mole' for a particular process.  For convenience and due to the range of magnitudes involved these quantities are almost always reported in kJ·mol −1 rather than in J·mol −1 . For example, heats of fusion and vaporization are usually of the order of 10 kJ·mol −1 , bond energies are of the order of 100 kJ·mol −1 , and ionization energies of the order of 1000 kJ·mol −1 .  1 kJ·mol −1 is equal to 0.239 kcal·mol −1 or 1.04×10 −2  eV per particle. At room temperature (25 °C , 77 °F , or 298.15 K ) 1 kJ·mol −1 is equal to 0.4034      k  B   T       subscript  k  B   T    k_{B}T    .  References  "  Category:SI derived units
