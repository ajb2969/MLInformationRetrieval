Indoleacetate—lysine synthetase




Indoleacetate—lysine synthetase

In enzymology, an indoleacetate-lysine synthetase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + (indol-3-yl)acetate + L-lysine 
 
 
 
  ADP + phosphate + N6-[(indol-3-yl)acetyl]-L-lysine
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, (indol-3-yl)acetate, and L-lysine, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and [[N6-[(indol-3-yl)acetyl]-L-lysine]].
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is (indol-3-yl)acetate:L-lysine ligase (ADP-forming). This enzyme is also called indoleacetate:L-lysine ligase (ADP-forming).
