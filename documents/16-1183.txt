   Prime avoidance lemma      Prime avoidance lemma   In algebra , the prime avoidance lemma says that if an ideal I in a commutative ring  R is contained in a union of finitely many prime ideals  P i 's, then it is contained in P i for some i .  There are many variations of the lemma (cf. Hochster); for example, if the ring R contains an infinite field or a finite field of sufficiently large cardinality, then the statement follows from a fact in linear algebra that a vector space over an infinite field or a finite field of large cardinality is not a finite union of its proper vector subspaces. 1  Statement and proof  The following statement and argument are perhaps the most standard.  Statement : Let E be a subset of R that is an additive subgroup of R and is multiplicatively closed. Let      I  1   ,   I  2   ,  …  ,   I  n   ,  n   ≥  1        subscript  I  1    subscript  I  2   normal-…   subscript  I  n   n   1    I_{1},I_{2},\dots,I_{n},n\geq 1   be ideals such that    I  i     subscript  I  i    I_{i}   are prime ideals for    i  ≥  3      i  3    i\geq 3   . If E is not contained in any of    I  i     subscript  I  i    I_{i}   's, then E is not contained in the union    ∪   I  i        subscript  I  i     \cup I_{i}   .  Proof by induction on n : The idea is to find an element that is in E and not in any of    I  i     subscript  I  i    I_{i}   's. The basic case n = 1 is trivial. Next suppose n ≥ 2. For each i choose       z  i   ∈  E  -   ∪   j  ≠  i     I  j      fragments   subscript  z  i    E    subscript     j  i     subscript  I  j     z_{i}\in E-\cup_{j\neq i}I_{j}   where the set on the right is nonempty by inductive hypothesis. We can assume     z  i   ∈   I  i        subscript  z  i    subscript  I  i     z_{i}\in I_{i}   for all i ; otherwise, some    z  i     subscript  z  i    z_{i}   avoids all the    I  i     subscript  I  i    I_{i}   's and we are done. Put      z  =     z  1   …   z   n  -  1     +   z  n        z       subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z    n  1      subscript  z  n      z=z_{1}\dots z_{n-1}+z_{n}   . Then z is in E but not in any of    I  i     subscript  I  i    I_{i}   's. Indeed, if z is in    I  i     subscript  I  i    I_{i}   for some    i  ≤   n  -  1       i    n  1     i\leq n-1   , then    z  n     subscript  z  n    z_{n}   is in    I  i     subscript  I  i    I_{i}   , a contradiction. Suppose z is in    I  n     subscript  I  n    I_{n}   . Then     z  1   …   z   n  -  1         subscript  z  1   normal-…   subscript  z    n  1      z_{1}\dots z_{n-1}   is in    I  n     subscript  I  n    I_{n}   . If n is 2, we are done. If n > 2, then, since    I  n     subscript  I  n    I_{n}   is a prime ideal, some      z  i   ,  i   <  n        subscript  z  i   i   n    z_{i},i   is in    I  n     subscript  I  n    I_{n}   , a contradiction.

Consider a finite product of linear functionals , each of which vanishes on a proper subspace that appears in the union; then it is a nonzero polynomial vanishing identically, a contradiction. ↩
