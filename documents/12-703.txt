   Hindmarsh–Rose model      Hindmarsh–Rose model   The Hindmarsh–Rose model of neuronal activity is aimed to study the spiking -bursting behavior of the membrane potential observed in experiments made with a single neuron. The relevant variable is the membrane potential, x ( t ), which is written in dimensionless units . There are two more variables, y ( t ) and z ( t ), which take into account the transport of ions across the membrane through the ion channels . The transport of sodium and potassium ions is made through fast ion channels and its rate is measured by y ( t ), which is called the spiking variable. The transport of other ions is made through slow channels, and is taken into account through z ( t ), which is called the bursting variable. Then, the Hindmarsh–Rose model has the mathematical form of a system of three nonlinear ordinary differential equations on the dimensionless dynamical variables x ( t ), y ( t ), and z ( t ). They read:  (Figure)  Simulation of Hindmarsh–Rose neuron showing typical neuronal bursting .         d  x    d  t          d  x     d  t     \displaystyle\frac{dx}{dt}     where      ϕ   (  x  )       ϕ  x    \displaystyle\phi(x)     The model has eight parameters: a , b , c , d , r , s , x R and I . It is common to fix some of them and let the others be control parameters. Usually the parameter I , which means the current that enters the neuron, is taken as a control parameter. Other control parameters used often in the literature are a , b , c , d , or r , the first four modeling the working of the fast ion channels and the last one the slow ion channels, respectively. Frequently, the parameters held fixed are s = 4 and x R = -8/5. When a , b , c , d are fixed the values given are a = 1, b = 3, c = 1, and d = 5. The parameter r is something of the order of 10 −3 , and I ranges between −10 and 10.  The third state equation:        d  z    d  t          d  z     d  t     \displaystyle\frac{dz}{dt}   allows a great variety of dynamic behaviors of the membrane potential, described by variable x, including unpredictable behavior, which is referred to as chaotic dynamics . This makes the Hindmarsh–Rose model relatively simple and provides a good qualitative description of the many different patterns that are observed empirically.
