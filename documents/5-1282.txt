Rado's theorem (Ramsey theory)

Rado's theorem is a theorem from the branch of mathematics known as Ramsey theory. It is named for the German mathematician Richard Rado. It was proved in his thesis, Studien zur Kombinatorik.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a system of linear equations, where 
 
 
 
  is a matrix with integer entries. This system is said to be 
 
 
-regular if, for every 
 
 
 
 
 -coloring of the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., the system has a monochromatic solution. A system is regular if it is r-regular for all r ≥ 1.
Rado's theorem states that a system 
 
 
 
  is regular if and only if the matrix A satisfies the columns condition. Let ci denote the i-th column of A. The matrix A satisfies the columns condition provided that there exists a partition C1, C2, ..., Cn of the column indices such that if 
 
 
 
 , then

s1 = 0
for all i ≥ 2, si can be written as a rational1 linear combination of the cj's in the Ck with k < i.

Folkman's theorem, the statement that there exist arbitrarily large sets of integers all of whose nonempty sums are monochromatic, may be seen as a special case of Rado's theorem concerning the regularity of the system of equations
