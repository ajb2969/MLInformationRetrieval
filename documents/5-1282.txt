   Rado's theorem (Ramsey theory)      Rado's theorem (Ramsey theory)   Rado's theorem is a theorem from the branch of mathematics known as Ramsey theory . It is named for the German mathematician Richard Rado . It was proved in his thesis, Studien zur Kombinatorik .  Let     A  𝐱   =  𝟎        A  𝐱   0    A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}   be a system of linear equations, where   A   A   A   is a matrix with integer entries. This system is said to be   r   r   r    -regular if, for every   r   r   r   -coloring of the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, ..., the system has a monochromatic solution. A system is regular if it is r-regular for all r ≥ 1.  Rado's theorem states that a system     A  𝐱   =  𝟎        A  𝐱   0    A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{0}   is regular if and only if the matrix A satisfies the columns condition . Let c i denote the i -th column of A . The matrix A satisfies the columns condition provided that there exists a partition C 1 , C 2 , ..., C n of the column indices such that if     s  i   =    Σ   j  ∈   C  i      c  j         subscript  s  i      subscript  normal-Σ    j   subscript  C  i      subscript  c  j      s_{i}=\Sigma_{j\in C_{i}}c_{j}   , then   s 1 = 0  for all i ≥ 2, s i can be written as a rational 1 linear combination of the c j 's in the C k with k < i .   Folkman's theorem , the statement that there exist arbitrarily large sets of integers all of whose nonempty sums are monochromatic, may be seen as a special case of Rado's theorem concerning the regularity of the system of equations        x  T   =    ∑   i  ∈  T     x   {  i  }      ,       subscript  x  T     subscript     i  T     subscript  x   i       x_{T}=\sum_{i\in T}x_{\{i\}},   where T ranges over each nonempty subset of the set 2  References    "  Category:Ramsey theory  Category:Theorems in discrete mathematics     Modern graph theory by Béla Bollobás. 1st ed. 1998.
