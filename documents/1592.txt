   O-phosphoseryl-tRNASec kinase      O-phosphoseryl-tRNASec kinase   O-phosphoseryl-tRNASec kinase (, PSTK , phosphoseryl-tRNA[Ser]Sec kinase , phosphoseryl-tRNASec kinase ) is an enzyme with system name ATP:L-seryl-tRNASec O-phosphotransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ATP + L-seryl-tRNASec   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + O-phospho-L-seryl-tRNASec   In archaea and eukarya  selenocysteine formation is achieved by a two-step process.
