   Hessenberg matrix      Hessenberg matrix   In linear algebra , a Hessenberg matrix is a special kind of square matrix , one that is "almost" triangular . To be exact, an upper Hessenberg matrix has zero entries below the first subdiagonal , and a lower Hessenberg matrix has zero entries above the first superdiagonal . 1 They are named after Karl Hessenberg . 2  For example:      [     1    4    2    3      3    4    1    7      0    2    3    4      0    0    1    3     ]      1  4  2  3    3  4  1  7    0  2  3  4    0  0  1  3     \begin{bmatrix}1&4&2&3\\
 3&4&1&7\\
 0&2&3&4\\
 0&0&1&3\\
 \end{bmatrix}   is upper Hessenberg and      [     1    2    0    0      5    2    3    0      3    4    3    7      5    6    1    1     ]      1  2  0  0    5  2  3  0    3  4  3  7    5  6  1  1     \begin{bmatrix}1&2&0&0\\
 5&2&3&0\\
 3&4&3&7\\
 5&6&1&1\\
 \end{bmatrix}   is lower Hessenberg.  Computer programming  Many linear algebra algorithms require significantly less computational effort when applied to triangular matrices , and this improvement often carries over to Hessenberg matrices as well. If the constraints of a linear algebra problem do not allow a general matrix to be conveniently reduced to a triangular one, reduction to Hessenberg form is often the next best thing. In fact, reduction of any matrix to a Hessenberg form can be achieved in a finite number of steps (for example, through Householder's algorithm of unitary similarity transforms). Subsequent reduction of Hessenberg matrix to a triangular matrix can be achieved through iterative procedures, such as shifted QR -factorization. In eigenvalue algorithms , the Hessenberg matrix can be further reduced to a triangular matrix through Shifted QR-factorization combined with deflation steps. Reducing a general matrix to a Hessenberg matrix and then reducing further to a triangular matrix, instead of directly reducing a general matrix to a triangular matrix, often economizes the arithmetic involved in the QR algorithm for eigenvalue problems.  Properties  The product of a Hessenberg matrix with a triangular matrix is again Hessenberg. More precisely, if A is upper Hessenberg and T is upper triangular, then AT and TA are upper Hessenberg.  A matrix that is both upper Hessenberg and lower Hessenberg is a tridiagonal matrix .  See also   Hessenberg variety   Notes    References    .   .
