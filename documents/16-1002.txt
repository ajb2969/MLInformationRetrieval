Key-independent optimality




Key-independent optimality

Key-independent optimality is a property of some binary search tree data structures in computer science proposed by John Iacono.1 Suppose that key-value pairs are stored in a data structure, and that the keys have no relation to their paired values. A data structure has **key-independent optimality** if, when randomly assigning the keys, the expected performance of the data structure is within a constant factor of the optimal data structure. Key-independent optimality is related to dynamic optimality.
Definitions
There are many binary search tree algorithms that can look up a sequence of 
 
 
 
  keys 
 
 
 
 , where each 
 
 
 
  is a number between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . For each sequence 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the fastest binary search tree algorithm that looks up the elements in 
 
 
 
  in order. Let 
 
 
 
  be one of the 
 
 
 
  possible permutation of the sequence 
 
 
 
 , chosen at random, where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 th entry of 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 . Iacono defined, for a sequence 
 
 
 
 , that 
 
 
 
 
 .
A data structure has key-independent optimality if it can lookup the elements in 
 
 
 
  in time 
 
 
 
 .
Relationship with other bounds
Key-independent optimality has been proved to be asymptotically equivalent to the working set theorem. Splay trees are known to have key-independent optimality.
