   Key-independent optimality      Key-independent optimality   Key-independent optimality is a property of some binary search tree data structures in computer science proposed by John Iacono. 1 Suppose that key-value pairs are stored in a data structure, and that the keys have no relation to their paired values. A data structure has **key-independent optimality** if, when randomly assigning the keys, the expected performance of the data structure is within a constant factor of the optimal data structure. Key-independent optimality is related to dynamic optimality .  Definitions  There are many binary search tree algorithms that can look up a sequence of   m   m   m   keys    X  =    x  1   ,   x  2   ,  ⋯  ,   x  m        X    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  m      X=x_{1},x_{2},\cdots,x_{m}   , where each    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   is a number between   1   1   1   and   n   n   n   . For each sequence   X   X   X   , let    𝑂𝑃𝑇   (  X  )       OPT  X    \textit{OPT}(X)   be the fastest binary search tree algorithm that looks up the elements in   X   X   X   in order. Let   b   b   b   be one of the    n  !      n    n!   possible permutation of the sequence    1  ,  2  ,  ⋯  ,  n     1  2  normal-⋯  n    1,2,\cdots,n   , chosen at random, where    b   (  i  )       b  i    b(i)   is the   i   i   i   th entry of   b   b   b   . Let     b   (  X  )    =    b   (   x  1   )    ,   b   (   x  2   )    ,  ⋯  ,   b   (   x  m   )           b  X      b   subscript  x  1      b   subscript  x  2    normal-⋯    b   subscript  x  m       b(X)=b(x_{1}),b(x_{2}),\cdots,b(x_{m})   . Iacono defined, for a sequence   X   X   X   , that     𝐾𝐼𝑂𝑃𝑇   (  X  )    =   E   [   𝑂𝑃𝑇   (   b   (  X  )    )    ]          KIOPT  X     E   delimited-[]    OPT    b  X        \textit{KIOPT}(X)=E[\textit{OPT}(b(X))]   .  A data structure has key-independent optimality if it can lookup the elements in   X   X   X   in time    O   (   𝐾𝐼𝑂𝑃𝑇   (  X  )    )       O    KIOPT  X     O(\textit{KIOPT}(X))   .  Relationship with other bounds  Key-independent optimality has been proved to be asymptotically equivalent to the working set theorem . Splay trees are known to have key-independent optimality.
