Wall's finiteness obstruction

In geometric topology, a field within mathematics, the obstruction to a finitely dominated space X being homotopy-equivalent to a finite CW-complex is its Wall finiteness obstruction w(X) which is an element in the reduced zeroth algebraic K-theory of the integral group ring

 
 . It is named after the mathematician C. T. C. Wall.
By Milnor's work1 on finitely dominated spaces, no generality is lost in letting X be a CW-complex. A finite domination of X is a finite CW-complex K together with maps 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . By a construction due to Milnor it is possible to extend r to a homotopy equivalence 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a complex obtained from K by attaching cells to kill the relative homotopy groups 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  will be finite if all relative homotopy groups are finitely generated. Wall showed that this will be the case if and only if his finiteness obstruction vanishes. More precisely, using covering space theory and the Hurewicz theorem one can identify 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Wall then showed that the cellular chain complex 
 
 
 
  is chain-homotopy equivalent to a chain complex 
 
 
 
  of finite type of projective 
 
 
 
 -modules, and that 
 
 
 
  will be finitely generated if and only if these modules are stably-free. Stably-free modules vanish in reduced K-theory. This motivates the definition
