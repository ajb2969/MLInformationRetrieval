   Fundamental normality test      Fundamental normality test   In complex analysis , a mathematical discipline, the fundamental normality test gives sufficient conditions to test the normality of a family of analytic functions . It is another name for the stronger version of Montel's Theorem .  Statement of theorem  Let   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   be a family of analytic functions defined on a domain   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   . If there are two fixed complex numbers a and b that are omitted from the range of every ƒ ∈   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , then   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is a normal family on   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   .  The proof relies on properties of the elliptic modular function and can be found here:  See also   Montel's theorem   "  Category:Complex analysis
