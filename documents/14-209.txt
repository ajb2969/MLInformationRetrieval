Fundamental normality test

In complex analysis, a mathematical discipline, the fundamental normality test gives sufficient conditions to test the normality of a family of analytic functions. It is another name for the stronger version of Montel's Theorem.
Statement of theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a family of analytic functions defined on a domain 
 
 
 
 . If there are two fixed complex numbers a and b that are omitted from the range of every ƒ ∈ 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a normal family on 
 
 
 
 .
The proof relies on properties of the elliptic modular function and can be found here:
