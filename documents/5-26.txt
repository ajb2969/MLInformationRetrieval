   Spherical 3-manifold      Spherical 3-manifold   In mathematics , a spherical 3-manifold  M is a 3-manifold of the form      M  =    S  3   /  Γ       M     superscript  S  3   normal-Γ     M=S^{3}/\Gamma   where   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is a finite  subgroup of SO(4)  acting freely by rotations on the 3-sphere     S  3     superscript  S  3    S^{3}   . All such manifolds are prime , orientable , and closed . Spherical 3-manifolds are sometimes called elliptic 3-manifolds or Clifford-Klein manifolds.  Properties  A spherical 3-manifold has a finite fundamental group  isomorphic to Γ itself. The elliptization conjecture , proved by Grigori Perelman , states that conversely all 3-manifolds with finite fundamental group are spherical manifolds.  The fundamental group is either cyclic , or is a central extension of a dihedral , tetrahedral , octahedral , or icosahedral group by a cyclic group of even order. This divides the set of such manifolds into 5 classes, described in the following sections.  The spherical manifolds are exactly the manifolds with spherical geometry, one of the 8 geometries of Thurston's geometrization conjecture .  Cyclic case (lens spaces)  The manifolds     S  3   /  Γ       superscript  S  3   normal-Γ    S^{3}/\Gamma   with Γ cyclic are precisely the 3-dimensional lens spaces . A lens space is not determined by its fundamental group (there are non- homeomorphic lens spaces with isomorphic fundamental groups); but any other spherical manifold is.  Three-dimensional lens spaces arise as quotients of     S  3   ⊂   ℂ  2        superscript  S  3    superscript  ℂ  2     S^{3}\subset\mathbb{C}^{2}   by the action of the group that is generated by elements of the form       (     ω    0      0     ω  q      )   .      ω  0    0   superscript  ω  q      \begin{pmatrix}\omega&0\\
 0&\omega^{q}\end{pmatrix}.     where    ω  =   e    2  π  i   /  p        ω   superscript  e      2  π  i   p      \omega=e^{2\pi i/p}   . Such a lens space    L   (  p  ;  q  )       L   p  q     L(p;q)   has fundamental group     ℤ  /  p   ℤ        ℤ  p   ℤ    \mathbb{Z}/p\mathbb{Z}   for all   q   q   q   , so spaces with different   p   p   p   are not homotopy equivalent. Moreover, classifications up to homeomorphism and homotopy equivalence are known, as follows. The three-dimensional spaces    L   (  p  ;   q  1   )       L   p   subscript  q  1      L(p;q_{1})   and    L   (  p  ;   q  2   )       L   p   subscript  q  2      L(p;q_{2})   are:   homotopy equivalent if and only if      q  1    q  2    ≡    ±   n  2       (   mod  p   )           subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2     annotated   plus-or-minus   superscript  n  2     pmod  p      q_{1}q_{2}\equiv\pm n^{2}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)   for some     n  ∈  ℕ   ;      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N};     homeomorphic if and only if      q  1   ≡    ±   q  2   ±  1        (   mod  p   )     .       subscript  q  1    annotated   plus-or-minus   superscript   subscript  q  2    plus-or-minus  1      pmod  p      q_{1}\equiv\pm q_{2}^{\pm 1}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).      In particular, the lens spaces L (7,1) and L (7,2) give examples of two 3-manifolds that are homotopy equivalent but not homeomorphic.  The lens space L (1,0) is the 3-sphere, and the lens space L (2,1) is 3 dimensional real projective space.  Lens spaces can be represented as Seifert fiber spaces in many ways, usually as fiber spaces over the 2-sphere with at most two exceptional fibers, though the lens space with fundamental group of order 4 also has a representation as a Seifert fiber space over the projective plane with no exceptional fibers.  Dihedral case (prism manifolds)  A prism manifold is a closed 3-dimensional manifold  M whose fundamental group is a central extension of a dihedral group.  The fundamental group π 1 ( M ) of M is a product of a cyclic group of order m with a group having presentation      ⟨   x  ,  y   ∣     x  y   x   -  1     =   y   -  1     ,    x   2  k    =   y  n     ⟩     inner-product   x  y    formulae-sequence      x  y   superscript  x    1      superscript  y    1        superscript  x   superscript  2  k     superscript  y  n       \langle x,y\mid xyx^{-1}=y^{-1},x^{2^{k}}=y^{n}\rangle     for integers k , m , n with k ≥ 1, m ≥ 1, n ≥ 2 and m coprime to 2 n .  Alternatively, the fundamental group has presentation      ⟨   x  ,  y   ∣     x  y   x   -  1     =   y   -  1     ,    x   2  m    =   y  n     ⟩     inner-product   x  y    formulae-sequence      x  y   superscript  x    1      superscript  y    1        superscript  x    2  m     superscript  y  n       \langle x,y\mid xyx^{-1}=y^{-1},x^{2m}=y^{n}\rangle     for coprime integers m , n with m ≥ 1, n ≥ 2. (The n here equals the previous n , and the m here is 2 k -1 times the previous m .)  We continue with the latter presentation. This group is a metacyclic group of order 4 mn with abelianization of order 4 m (so m and n are both determined by this group). The element y generates a cyclic  normal subgroup of order 2 n , and the element x has order 4 m . The center is cyclic of order 2 m and is generated by x 2 , and the quotient by the center is the dihedral group of order 2 n .  When m = 1 this group is a binary dihedral or dicyclic group . The simplest example is m = 1, n = 2, when π 1 ( M ) is the quaternion group of order 8.  Prism manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups: if a closed 3-manifold has the same fundamental group as a prism manifold M , it is homeomorphic to M .  Prism manifolds can be represented as Seifert fiber spaces in two ways.  Tetrahedral case  The fundamental group is a product of a cyclic group of order m with a group having presentation      ⟨   x  ,  y  ,  z   ∣      (   x  y   )   2   =   x  2   =   y  2    ,     z  x   z   -  1     =  y   ,     z  y   z   -  1     =   x  y    ,    z   3  k    =  1      ⟩     inner-product   x  y  z    formulae-sequence       superscript    x  y   2    superscript  x  2         superscript  y  2      formulae-sequence      z  x   superscript  z    1     y    formulae-sequence      z  y   superscript  z    1       x  y       superscript  z   superscript  3  k    1        \langle x,y,z\mid(xy)^{2}=x^{2}=y^{2},zxz^{-1}=y,zyz^{-1}=xy,z^{3^{k}}=1\rangle     for integers k , m with k ≥ 1, m ≥ 1 and m coprime to 6.  Alternatively, the fundamental group has presentation      ⟨   x  ,  y  ,  z   ∣      (   x  y   )   2   =   x  2   =   y  2    ,     z  x   z   -  1     =  y   ,     z  y   z   -  1     =   x  y    ,    z   3  m    =  1      ⟩     inner-product   x  y  z    formulae-sequence       superscript    x  y   2    superscript  x  2         superscript  y  2      formulae-sequence      z  x   superscript  z    1     y    formulae-sequence      z  y   superscript  z    1       x  y       superscript  z    3  m    1        \langle x,y,z\mid(xy)^{2}=x^{2}=y^{2},zxz^{-1}=y,zyz^{-1}=xy,z^{3m}=1\rangle     for an odd integer m ≥ 1. (The m here is 3 k -1 times the previous m .)  We continue with the latter presentation. This group has order 24 m . The elements x and y generate a normal subgroup isomorphic to the quaternion group of order 8. The center is cyclic of order 2 m . It is generated by the elements z 3 and x 2 = y 2 , and the quotient by the center is the tetrahedral group, equivalently, the alternating group  A 4 .  When m = 1 this group is the binary tetrahedral group .  These manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups. They can all be represented in an essentially unique way as Seifert fiber spaces : the quotient manifold is a sphere and there are 3 exceptional fibers of orders 2, 3, and 3.  Octahedral case  The fundamental group is a product of a cyclic group of order m coprime to 6 with the binary octahedral group (of order 48) which has the presentation       ⟨   x  ,  y   ∣     (   x  y   )   2   =   x  3   =   y  4    ⟩   .     inner-product   x  y        superscript    x  y   2    superscript  x  3         superscript  y  4       \langle x,y\mid(xy)^{2}=x^{3}=y^{4}\rangle.     These manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups. They can all be represented in an essentially unique way as Seifert fiber spaces : the quotient manifold is a sphere and there are 3 exceptional fibers of orders 2, 3, and 4.  Icosahedral case  The fundamental group is a product of a cyclic group of order m coprime to 30 with the binary icosahedral group (order 120) which has the presentation       ⟨   x  ,  y   ∣     (   x  y   )   2   =   x  3   =   y  5    ⟩   .     inner-product   x  y        superscript    x  y   2    superscript  x  3         superscript  y  5       \langle x,y\mid(xy)^{2}=x^{3}=y^{5}\rangle.     When m is 1, the manifold is the Poincaré homology sphere .  These manifolds are uniquely determined by their fundamental groups. They can all be represented in an essentially unique way as Seifert fiber spaces: the quotient manifold is a sphere and there are 3 exceptional fibers of orders 2, 3, and 5.
