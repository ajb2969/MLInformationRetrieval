Pinosylvin synthase




Pinosylvin synthase

In enzymology, a pinosylvin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3 malonyl-CoA + cinnamoyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  4 CoA + pinosylvin + 4 CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and cinnamoyl-CoA, whereas its 3 products are CoA, pinosylvin, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:cinnamoyl-CoA malonyltransferase (cyclizing). Other names in common use include stilbene synthase, and pine stilbene synthase. This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.
