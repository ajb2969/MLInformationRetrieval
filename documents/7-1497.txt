Reproductive value is a concept in demography and population genetics that represents the discounted number of future girl children that will be born to a woman of a specific age. Ronald Fisher first defined reproductive value in his 1930 book The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection where he proposed that future offspring be discounted at the rate of growth of the population; this implies that  sexually reproductive value measures the contribution of an individual of a given age to the future growth of the population.12
Definition
Consider a species with a life history table with survival and reproductive parameters given by 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where


 
  = probability of surviving from age 0 to age 
 
 
 
  and


 
  = average number of offspring produced by an individual of age 
 
 

In a population with a discrete set of age classes, Fisher's reproductive value is calculated as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the long-term population growth rate given by the dominant eigenvalue of the Leslie matrix. When age classes are continuous,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the intrinsic rate of increase or Malthusian growth rate.
