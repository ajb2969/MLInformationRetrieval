Poker probability (Omaha)




Poker probability (Omaha)

Omaha Hold'em, (love) like many similar poker variants, is probabilistic. Thus, the probability of many events can be determined by direct calculation. The probabilities are shown here for many commonly occurring events in the game of Omaha hold 'em as well as probabilities and odds for specific situations. In most cases, the probabilities and odds are approximations due to rounding.
When calculating probabilities for a card game such as Omaha, there are two basic approaches.

Determine the number of outcomes that satisfy the condition being evaluated and divide this by the total number of possible outcomes.
Use conditional probabilities, or in more complex situations, a decision graph.

Often, the key to determining probability is selecting the best approach for a given problem. This article uses both of these approaches, but relies primarily on enumeration.
Starting hands
The probability of being dealt various starting hands can be explicitly calculated. In Omaha, a player is dealt four down (or hole) cards. The first card can be any one of 52 playing cards in the deck; the second card can be any one of the 51 remaining cards; the third and fourth any of the 50 and 49 remaining cards, respectively. There are 4! = 24 ways (4! is read "four factorial") to order the four cards (ABCD, ABDC, ACBD, ACDB, ...) which gives 52 × 51 × 50 × 49 ÷ 24 = 270,725 possible starting hand combinations. Alternatively, the number of possible starting hands is represented as the binomial coefficient



which is the number of possible combinations of choosing 4 cards from a deck of 52 playing cards.
The 270,725 starting hands can be reduced for purposes of determining the probability of starting hands for Omaha—since suits have no relative value in poker, many of these hands are identical in value before the flop. The only factors determining the strength of a starting hand are the ranks of the cards and whether cards in the hand share the same suit. Of the 270,725 combinations, there are 16,432 distinct starting hands grouped into 16 shapes. Throughout this article, hand shape is indicated with the ranks denoted using uppercase letters and suits denoted using lower case letters. For example, the hand shape XaXbYaYc is any hand containing two pair (XX and YY) that share one suit (a), but not the other suits (b and c). The 16 hand shapes can be organized into the following five hand types based on the ranks of the cards.

Unlike the rank types, the suit types can be absolutely ranked in terms of starting hand value because suits in poker hands only factor in flushes and straight flushes. From best to worst starting hand value the suit types are: aabb, aabc, aaab, aaaa, and abcd.
The relative probability of being dealt a hand of each given shape is different. The following shows the probabilities and odds of being dealt each shape of starting hand.

Starting hands for straights
In addition to the rank type and suit type of a starting hand, each starting hand also has a sequence type that is useful for estimating the possibility of improving to a straight or straight flush. The sequence type is based on the sequential proximity of the ranks in the hand—the number of different ranks in the hand that can be combined to fill a straight on the board. The ace is a special case in the sequence type because it can be either high or low (i.e. can make a straight with A-2-3-4-5 or 10-J-Q-K-A), and is also both the high and low card in the rank sequence from which straights are formed: A-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9-10-J-Q-K-A.
The sequence type of the hand is only relevant in determining the probability of making a straight or straight flush. In order to make a straight, exactly three community cards must be combined with exactly two cards from the starting hand. Thus the sequence shape of a hand is the number of different combinations of three cards that can make a straight when combined with two cards from the hand. There are 20 different sequence shapes ranging from hands like 2-2-8-K that can't make a straight (0 straight combinations) to hands like 8-9-10-J that can make a straight with 20 different combinations of three ranks (5-6-7, 6-7-8, 6-7-9, 6-7-10, 7-8-9, 7-8-10, 7-8-J, 7-9-10, 7-9-J, 7-10-J, 8-9-Q, 8-10-Q, 8-J-Q, 9-10-Q, 9-J-Q, 9-Q-K, 10-J-Q, 10-Q-K, J-Q-K, Q-K-A). The 20 sequence shapes can be organized by the number of ranks in the starting hand. This is similar to the rank type of the hand, the only difference being that both the rank types two pair (XXYY) and three of a kind (XXXY) have two ranks. The following table shows the four sequence types based on the number of distinct ranks in the starting hand.

Note that the table above shows 36 sequence shapes because although there are only 20 different sequence shapes, the sequence shapes overlap with the sequence types. For example, the sequence shape where two different combinations of three cards can make a straight occurs for hands with two ranks (e.g. 3-6 makes a straight with 2-4-5 or 4-5-7), three ranks (e.g. 2-J-A makes a straight with 10-Q-K or 3-4-5), and four ranks (e.g. 3-9-K-A makes a straight with 2-4-5 or 10-J-Q).
The relative probability of being dealt a hand of each sequence shape is different. The following shows the probabilities and odds of being dealt starting hands of each sequence shape.

As the table indicates, there is a 98.8% chance that a starting hand will have at least one straight draw, but only a 3.3% chance that it will have more than 12 ways to make a straight.
Starting hands for straight flushes
The set of starting hands that can make a straight flush are a subset of the intersection of the set of hands that can make a straight and the set of hands that can make a flush. The hands that can make a straight flush can be organized similar to the parent superset of hands that can make a straight.
The straight flush sequence shape of a hand is the number of different combinations of three cards that can make a straight flush when combined with two cards from the hand. There are 9 different straight flush sequence shapes ranging from hands that can't make a straight flush to hands like  that can make a straight flush with 8 different combinations of three cards (, , , , , , , ).
As with straights, the relative probability of being dealt a hand of each straight flush sequence shape is different. The following shows the probabilities and odds of being dealt starting hands of each straight flush sequence shape.

Low starting hands
Omaha Hi-Low is a high-low split variant where the best qualifying low hand, if any, splits the pot with the high hand. Different cards can be used to form the high and low hands, each using two cards from the player's hand and three from the board, and a single player can win both the high and low pots. In Omaha/8, the most common form played in American casinos, a qualifying low hand is 8-high or lower (8-7-6-5-4 or lower). A less common variant of Omaha Hi-Lo uses a qualifying low hand of 9-high or lower (9-8-7-6-5 or lower).
Suits and cards higher than the maximum qualifying low hand do not factor into low hands and neither do straights and flushes. Based on the ranks of cards, low starting hands in Omaha Hi-Lo are grouped into 12 different low-hand shapes, seven of which have the possibility of making a qualifying low hand. The low hand shapes can be organized by the number of distinct low card ranks in the hand: 0 or 1 low ranks (no low hand possible), 2 low ranks, 3 low ranks and 4 low ranks. The number of distinct low hands depends on the low-hand qualifier.

The probability of making a low hand depends on the number of low card ranks in the hand. However, although both are important, the probability of having the lowest hand depends more on the ranks of the low cards than on the number of low cards.
Hand selection
Beginning hand selection is critical in Omaha. Exactly two hole cards are combined with three community cards to form a hand in Omaha. The most favorable hand shapes have two suits with two cards in each suit, giving the hand two flush draws; have card ranks that are consecutive, giving the hand straight possibilities; and have one or more pairs, giving the hand a pair, and draws to three of a kind, full house and four of a kind possibilities. This makes the hands with the shape XaXbYaYb, with the ranks of X and Y adjacent, great starting hands in Omaha. Against one opponent, AaAbKaKb is the strongest starting hand in Omaha (against multiple opponents, the strongest starting hand is AaAbJaTb), while in Omaha Hi-Low the best starting hand is AaAb2a3b, which gives A-2-3 for making a low hand and straights, two suited aces for nut flushes, and a pair of aces for high. The best low starting hand is A-2-3-4, which makes the nut low hand more than 92% of the time when a qualifying low hand is possible and has a better than 50% chance to win at least a portion of the pot at showdown with an 8-high low qualifier, and at least ⅔ of the time will win at least a portion of the pot with a 9-high qualifier.
Contrary to most poker variants, more is not necessarily better (or the same) in Omaha, because only two hole cards are used. Because of this limitation, hands with more than two of the same suit or more than two of the same rank are weaker than the hand would be with exactly two of the suit or rank. The extra cards of the same suit remove outs for the flush draw and the extra cards of the same rank remove valuable outs for three of a kind, a full house, and four of a kind. The suit type aaaa is only about half as likely to make a flush as aabc. Paradoxically, the worst hand in Omaha hold 'em is four of a kind deuces (twos), because this hand can only make a pair of deuces plus the community cards. A much more common poor starting hand has the shape XaYbZcRd with the ranks of the cards spaced, such as —this hand has no flush draw, limited straight possibilities, and no pairs, although it has many more possibilities than 2-2-2-2 and considerably more than .
Some professional poker players have created point systems for evaluating starting hands in Omaha, with the decision to raise, fold or call based on the number of points assigned to the starting hand.123 However, because of the necessary simplifications point systems make, there is disagreement regarding the value of particular point systems and point systems in general.4
The flop
There are



possible flops assuming a random starting hand. By the turn the total number of combinations has increased to



and on the river there are



possible boards. For a given starting hand there are four known cards, which leaves



possible flops. At the turn the number of combinations is



and on the river there are



possible boards to go with the hand.
An Omaha poker hand consists of two cards from the player's hand and three cards from the board. Therefore, there are



ways to form a poker hand from a starting hand after the flop and


 
  and 
 
 

ways at the turn and river, respectively. By contrast, in Texas hold 'em there are only 
 
 

 
  and 
 
 
 
  ways to form a poker hand on the flop, turn and river, respectively. This increase in opportunities to make a hand means that the average strength of the winning hand in Omaha is higher than in Texas hold' em and other 7-card poker variants.
Making a low hand

See the section "Low starting hands" for a description of low hands in Omaha.


The first question regarding making a low hand in Omaha Hi-Lo is "how often does a qualifying low hand occur?" In order for any hand to qualify for low, the community cards must include at least three cards to a qualifying low hand. If 
 
 
 
  is the maximum rank (8 or 9) of a qualifying low hand, then assuming random starting hands, the probability 
 
 
 
  of the flop containing three cards to a qualifying low hand is



Three ranks from the available low ranks are chosen and each rank can have one of four suits. There are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  ways to choose three low ranks. The number of hands that can make a qualifying low are divided by the 
 
 
 
  possible flops. This gives the following low hand combinations and probabilities on the flop.

Calculating the probability of three low ranks on the board for the turn and river is slightly more complicated because there are multiple possibilities for the fourth card. By the turn a qualifying low is possible with either four low ranks, three low ranks and a pair, or three low ranks and a high card. The probability 
 
 
 
 
  of making at least three cards to a qualifying low hand by the turn is the sum of the probabilities for each of these configurations. Each probability is calculated by dividing the number of combinations that satisfy the conditions by the 
 
 
 
  possible boards on the turn.

As the last table indicates, there is a 60% chance that a low hand is possible at the river with an 8-high qualifying hand, and a 74% chance with a 9-high qualifier. The actually probability that there will be a qualifying low hand is less because there is a very real possibility that even with three cards to a low hand on the board, no player remaining in the hand at showdown can make a qualifying low hand.
Making a low hand based on low hand shape
Any hand starting with at least two different qualifying low ranks has a chance to make a low hand. The more different low ranks a hand has, the better the chances of making a low hand. Also, the more pairs and trips among the low ranks, the less chance there is of a low hand being possible and not being able to make a low hand. The following tables show the probability and odds of making a low hand, missing a low hand when one is possible (at least three qualifying low ranks on the board), and having no low hand possible for each of the starting low hand shapes on the flop, turn and river.

There are several interesting things to note about low hands. With an 8-high qualifier, the shape xyzr, which has four different low ranks, is the only starting hand with a greater than 50% chance of making a low hand before the flop. With a 9-high qualifier, any hand that can make a low hand has a greater than 50% chance of making a low hand. When playing a hand that has no chance at low, a hand like A-A-Q-J, which has two of the low aces, creates a significantly lower chance of there being a low than a hand like K-K-Q-J which has only high cards. With an 8-high qualifier the probability of a low hand being possible is reduced by about 10% (from 68.6% to 61.5%) and with a 9-high qualifier the probability is reduced by about 7% (from 82.2% to 76.2%). This is an often overlooked additional advantage of pocket aces over pocket kings with a high-only hand in Omaha Hi-Lo.
Making the nuts
The nuts is the best possible poker hand that can be made from the community cards. Due to the large number of opportunities to make a hand, it is not uncommon in Omaha for the winning hand to be the nuts, or at least close to it.
On the flop every poker hand uses the three community cards plus two other cards. For each board then, there are 
 
 
 
  ways to make a poker hand and



different possible combinations of poker hands made from the three community cards and two cards from a player's hand. On the turn there are 
 
 
 
  ways to select three community cards and 
 
 
 
  hand combinations giving 4 × 1,128 = 4,512 ways to make a poker hand for each board. This gives



combinations of hands on the turn. Finally, on the river there are 
 
 
 
  ways to select three community cards and 
 
 
 
  hand combinations giving 10,810 ways to make a poker hand for each board, resulting in



poker hand combinations possible on the river. For each board, one or more of the possible poker hands is the nuts.
Making high nuts
In the case of high hands, when the nuts is a royal flush or straight flush, the winning hand is often a flush; when the nuts is four of a kind, the winning hand is often a full house. The lowest hand that can be the nuts is three of a kind, which occurs when there is no straight or flush possible and no pair on the board. The lowest possible nut hand at the river is Q-Q-Q-8-7 which occurs when the board is one of the 600 possible combinations of Q-8-7-3-2 that doesn't have three or more of the same suit.
The following table shows the probability of the nut hand for the board on the flop, turn and river.

Notice that while three of a kind is a 60% favorite to be the nuts after the flop, it's less than 2% to still be on top at the river—although the three of a kind has a good chance of improving to a full house or four of a kind, if it doesn't improve, chances are the nut hand at the river is a straight, flush or straight flush. At the river, having the nuts be four of a kind is more likely (45.2%) than all of the hands ranked below four of a kind combined (44.8%). Also, despite the rarity of straight flushes at showdown, 10% of the boards will have one as the nut hand by the river.
Straight flush
A straight flush is possible whenever the board contains at least three cards of the same suit where the ranks of the suited cards can create a straight with the addition of exactly two ranks. For three ranks, the two lower ranks must be chosen from the up to four next lower ranks, counting the rank of ace as low when trying to make the straight A-2-3-4-5. There are 10 possible straights (Ace high to 5 high). A straight is also possible with any three ranks from A to 4, which gives 
 
 
 
  ways. This gives



combinations for a straight flush after the flop. With four or five cards of different ranks, the determination of the number of rank sets that yield a straight with the addition of exactly two cards is more involved because any enumeration must eliminate rank sets that are counted more than once, but it turns out that there are 432 such rank sets with four ranks and 1,208 with five ranks.5 At the turn there are two ways to make a straight flush—there can either be four cards of the same suit with a rank set that allows a straight, or three cards of the same suit that allow a straight combined with any of the 39 cards with a different suit. This gives



combinations after the turn. At the river a straight flush is possible with a suited rank set of either five cards, four cards combined with one of the 39 cards of another suit, or three cards combined with two of the remaining 39 cards, giving



combinations.
Four of a kind
Four of a kind is the nuts whenever there is a pair or three of a kind on the board and no possibility for a straight flush. After the flop, three of a kind is possible by choosing one of the 13 ranks and three of the four cards in that rank; a pair is possible by choosing one of the 13 ranks and two of the four cards in that rank combined with a card in one of the other 12 ranks in any of the four suits. So on the flop there are



boards with a pair or three of a kind. At the turn there can either be three of a kind and another rank, two pair, or one pair and two other ranks. In the case with one pair, any straight flushes made possible by the three different ranks must be subtracted. At the turn, the number of possible straight flushes with a pair on the board is one of the 64 rank sets with three cards that can make a straight in one of the four suits combined with a card that pairs one of the three cards to the straight flush, which is 
 
 
 
 . So there are



combinations that make four of a kind possible at the turn. On the river, four of a kind can be made when there is either a full house on the board, three of a kind and two other ranks, two pair and one other rank, or a pair and three other ranks. With three of a kind or two pair, any straight flushes made possible by the three different ranks must be subtracted and with a pair, any straight flushes made possible by the four different ranks are subtracted. For three of a kind, choose one of the three cards for the straight flush and then choose 2 of the 3 remaining cards of that rank to make three of a kind for 
 
 
 
  possible straight flushes. With two pair, choose two of the three cards that make a possible straight flush and then choose one of the three remaining cards for each rank to make one of 
 
 
 
  straight flushes. With a pair there are three cases where a straight flush is possible that have a total of 97,536 combinations:

the three non-pair ranks have the same suit as one of the cards in the pair and the four suited cards form one of the 432 rank sets that allows a straight (example ), so choosing one of the four suited ranks and one of the three remaining cards of that rank gives 
 
 
 
  possible straight flushes;
two of the non-pair ranks have the same suit as one of the cards in the pair and the three suited cards form one of the 64 rank sets that allows a straight (example ), so choosing one of the three suited ranks and one of the three remaining cards of that rank to combine with a card from one of the 10 remaining ranks in one of the three remaining suits gives 
 
 
 
  possible straight flushes;
the three non-pair ranks share a suit that is different from either of the suits in the pair and the three suited cards form one of the 64 rank sets that allows a straight (example ), so choose one of the 10 remaining ranks not used by the suited cards and choose two of the three cards of that rank that have a different suit to give 
 
 
 
  possible straight flushes.

Altogether there are















full houses












three of a kind












two pair












one pair




for a total of









combinations on the river that make four of a kind possible without making a straight flush possible.
Full house
Oddly enough, a full house can only be the nuts when there is four of a kind on the board (or if quads are not possible because you hold one of the cards necessary). This means that there is no chance of a full house being the nuts on the flop. On the turn and river there are


 
  and 
 
 

combinations that make four of a kind, respectively.
Flush
A flush is the nuts when no two cards share the same rank (no pairs, trips or quads) and there are three or more cards of the same suit that do not form a rank set that can make a straight. The number of rank sets that can't make a straight is 
 
 
 
  with three cards, 
 
 
 
  with four cards, and 
 
 
 
  with five cards. On the flop all three cards must be part of the flush which gives



combinations where the nuts is a flush. On the turn a nut flush is possible with either four cards of the same suit that form one of the 283 rank sets that doesn't allow a straight or with three cards of the same suit that form one of the 222 rank sets that doesn't allow a straight combined with one of the other 10 ranks in one of the other three suits. This gives



ways for a flush to be the nuts on the turn. On the river there are three ways to make a nut flush—five cards of the same suit that form one of 79 rank sets that can't make a straight; four cards of the same suit that can't make a straight combined with a card in one of the other nine ranks and one of the other three suits; or three cards of the same suit that can't make a straight combinded with two of the remaining 10 ranks, each selected from the three remaining suits. So there are



combinations on the river where the nut hand is a flush.
Straight
A straight is the nuts when no two cards share the same rank (no pairs, trips or quads), the ranks form a rank set that makes a straight possible with the addition of two cards, and no more than two cards share the same suit. Given 
 
 
 
  cards of distinct ranks, there are 
 
 
 
  ways to assign suits to the cards. This includes 4 suit sets that assign the same suit to each card; 
 
 
 
  suit sets that assign the same suit to 
 
 
 
  cards, and 
 
 
 
  suit sets that assign the same suit to 
 
 
 
  cards. The number of combinations on the flop where a straight is the nuts is then the 64 rank sets that allow a straight multiplied by the 
 
 
 
  suit sets that don't have three of the same suit:



For four ranks, there are 
 
 
 
  suit sets that have either three or four of the same suit, giving 
 
 
 
  suit sets where no more than two cards share the same suit. For five ranks there are 
 
 
 
  suit sets that have three or more of the same suit and 
 
 
 
  suit sets where no more than two cards share the same suit. This gives


 
  and 
 
 

combinations on the turn and river, respectively, where the nut hand is a straight.
Three of a kind
Finally, three of a kind is only the nuts when no two cards share the same rank (no pairs, trips or quads), the ranks form a rank set that can't make a straight with the addition of two cards, and no more than two cards share the same suit. As with a straight, the number of combinations is the number of possible rank sets multiplied by the number of allowed suit sets. On the flop, turn and river, respectively, the number of combinations where three of a kind is the nuts are


 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Making low nuts

''See the section Low starting hands for a description of low starting hand shapes.''
 

In Omaha Hi-Lo, it is often the case that when there is a low hand, the winning hand is the nut low hand. When there are more than two people in the pot at showdown and a low hand is possible, it is not uncommon for two or more players to both have the nut low hand. This makes playing a hand that is only contesting for the low half of the pot risky. For example, if at showdown there are two players in the pot and they each have the nut low hand but different high hands, the player with the better high hand will win 75% of the pot (split the low half and win the high half) and the other player wins just 25% of the pot (called "getting quartered").
A hand must have at least two different ranks from {A, 2, 3, 4, 5} in order to make a nut low hand. As with low starting hands in general, there are seven different shapes of low hands that can make the nut low. The probability of being dealt each of these hands is different. Using * to represent any of the 32 cards higher than 5 and lower case letters to represent card ranks from A–5, the following gives the probability of being dealt the various low hand shapes that can make a nut low.

As the table shows, there is a better than 44% chance of having a hand that has a possibility of making a nut low hand.
While the table above shows 105 distinct hands that can make a nut low, there are actually 165 different cases to consider. The extra cases come from how the * ranks higher than 5 are assigned. More low ranks in the hand decreases the number of low cards available to make a low hand possible, although they increase the chance of the hand making a non-nut low hand. For shapes xxy* and xyz*, * can either be a qualifying low rank higher than 5, or a non-qualifying high rank. This doubles the distinct hands to consider in these cases, adding 20 and 10 distinct hands for xxy* and xyz*, respectively. For shape xy** there are four ways ** can be assigned: either two different qualifying low ranks, the same qualifying low rank (a low pair), one qualifying low rank and one high rank, or two high ranks. This adds 3 × 10 = 30 more distinct hands for a total of 60 additional distinct hands.
The probability of a hand making the nut low depends on several aspects of the hand:

How many different ranks from A–5 the hand has;
The rank of the second lowest rank in the hand (2–5);
Pairs and trips involving the lowest two ranks—more cards here reduces the chance of the low being counterfeited (shapes xxy*, xxxy, xxyy, and xxyz);
The rank of the third lowest rank in the hand (shapes xyz*, xxyz, and xyzr);
The rank of the fourth lowest rank in the hand (shape xyzr);
Whether ranks above 5 can qualify for a low hand—that is, for the shapes xy**, xxy* and xyz*, if * is one or more cards of rank 6–8 or 6–9 for 8-high and 9-high qualifiers, respectively (more low cards here reduces the chance of a low hand being possible);
Pairs involving the third lowest rank in the hand when the third lowest rank can qualify for a low hand (shapes xy** and xxyz).

Perhaps surprisingly, although it affects the strength of non-nut low hands, the rank of the lowest card has no influence on either making a low hand or making the nut low hand. So the hands A-4-K-K and 3-4-10-K have the same probability of making both a nut-low hand and any low hand, although A-4-K-K is likely to make a better non-nut low hand. The hand A-4-7-K will have a slightly lower chance of making the nut low than either of the previous hands because the 7 in the hand reduces the chance of the board 2-3-7-10-J or A-2-7-10-J, which make nut low hands for A-4-K-K and 3-4-10-K, respectively. However, A-4-7-K will have a better chance of making a non-nut low hand because boards like 4-5-6-10-J still make a non-nut low for it, but make no low hand for either A-4-K-K or 3-4-10-K.
Combining the hands into groups based on the factors that determine the probabilities for making the nut low hand and making low hands, the 165 different cases fall into 56 groupings. The nut low hand shapes are denoted using the lower case letters x and y to represent qualifying low ranks higher than 5 (6–8 or 6–9 for 8- and 9-high qualifiers, respectively), and * to represent any high card. The following tables give the probability for select starting hands to make the nut low hand and make a non-nut low hand on the flop, turn and river. The hands in the table are listed in order of the probability of having the nut hand on the river, from highest probability to lowest. (See Probability of making the nut low hand in Omaha hold 'em for complete tables of all 165 nut low hand shapes.) The tables also give the probability that the hand will make a nut low hand if at least three different low ranks are on the board, making a low hand possible. See the section Making a low hand for the probabilities of a low hand being possible and the probability of making or missing a low hand when one is possible.

Making high hands
The probabilities for making high hands in Omaha hold 'em fall into three categories based on the poker hand:

Rank-based hands that are based solely on the rank type of the starting hand. This includes the poker hands four of a kind, full house, three of a kind, two pair, one pair, and no pair (high card).
Suit-based hands that are based solely on the suit type of the starting hand. The flush is the only poker hand based solely on suit.
Sequence-based hands that are based on the rank sequences in the starting hand. This includes both straights and straight flushes.

Making hands based on rank type

See the section "Starting hands" for a description of starting hands and rank types.


The probability of making either four of a kind, a full house, three of a kind, two pair, one pair or no pair depends only on the rank type of the starting hand. This ignores when these hands also make straights, flushes and straight flushes—these hands are based on the suit type and rank sequences of the starting hand. Starting hands consisting of four of a kind can only make a full house, two pair or one pair. Starting hands that include at least two cards of the same rank can make no less than one pair. The rank types have the following probabilities of improving on the flop, turn and river.

Not surprisingly, starting with two pair gives the best overall chance of making four of a kind, a full house or three of a kind; one pair has the next best chance for each of these hands. Two pair will improve to at least three of a kind by the river more than one in three times and will make a full house or four of a kind almost one in six times. However, starting with three of a kind is only marginally better than starting with no pair, and starting with three of a kind actually yields the lowest probability of making four of a kind. Starting with four of a kind has very few possibilities to improve—there is almost never a reason to play these hands.
See Probability derivations for making rank-based hands in Omaha hold 'em for the derivations for the probabilities in the preceding tables of making hands based on the rank type of the hand.
Making a flush

See the section "Starting hands" for a description of starting hands and suit types.


The probability of making a flush depends only on the suit type of the starting hand. This ignores when these hands also make four of a kind and full houses—these hands are based on the rank type of the starting hand. Starting hands consisting of all four suits (suit type abcd) can't make a flush. The starting hands that can make straight flushes are a subset of the hands that can make flushes and the boards that make straight flushes are a subset of the boards that make flushes. The subset of both starting hands and boards that can make straight flushes are based on the rank sequences of their respective suited cards.
To make a flush on the flop, all three cards must be the same suit. If 
 
 
 
  is the number of cards with the same suit in the hand (s = 2, 3, 4) then the probability 
 
 
 
  of making a flush on the flop with that suit is



On the turn a flush is possible with either four cards of the same suit, or three cards of the same suit combined with one of the 
 
 
 
  cards from one of the other suits, which gives the probability



for completing a flush in a suit by the turn. On the river there are three ways to fill a flush—five cards of the same suit; four cards of the same suit combined with one of the 35 + s cards in one of the other three suits; or three cards of the same suit combinded with two of the remaining 35 + s cards in one of the other three suits. This gives the probability



of making the flush by the river. For hands with flush draws in two suits (suit type aabb), multiply the probability of making a flush with two suited cards (s = 2) by the two suits to give probabilities of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The suit types with at least two of the same suit have the following probabilities of making a flush on the flop, turn and river.

Making a straight flush

See the section "Starting hands for straight flushes" for a description of straight flush starting hand types.


The probability of making a straight flush depends primarily on the number of different sets of three cards that can fill a straight flush in the hand. For convenience, the term straight flush sequence means a three-card set that can make a straight flush when combined with the starting hand. A secondary factor to the number of straight flush sequences, although much less significant, is the amount of overlap (shared cards) in the straight flush sequences—the more overlap, the lower the probability for a straight flush on the turn and river. More overlap reduces the probability because some of the board combinations make more than one straight flush and are thus counted multiple times.
For example, the hand  makes a straight flush with either of the two straight flush sequences  or , which have no overlap. The hand  makes a straight flush with either of the two straight flush sequences  or , which have an overlap of two cards—the  and . On the turn, the board  satisfies both sets and is only counted once, making the frequency of boards that make a straight flush on the turn for  one less than for . On the river, any of the 44 remaining cards combined with  makes two straight flushes, making the frequency of boards 44 less.
To make a straight flush on the flop, the three cards on the board must exactly match one of the straight flush sequences for the hand. If 
 
 
 
  is the number of straight flush sequences for a hand, then the frequency 
 
 
 
 
  of boards that make a straight flush on the flop is



On the turn, one of the 
 
 
 
  straight flush sequences can be combined with any of the remaining 45 cards. Enumerating the frequencies this way ends up counting any board that can form two different straight flushes twice. On the turn, for every pair of three card sets that share two cards (for example  and ) there is exactly one board that makes two straight flushes ( in the example). Where 
 
 
 
  is the number of boards containing four cards that make exactly two straight flushes, then the frequency 
 
 
 
  of boards that make a straight flush on the turn is



On the river, one of the 
 
 
 
  straight flush sequences can be combined with any two of the remaining 45 cards. Now all boards that make exactly two straight flushes are counted twice, and all boards the make exactly three straight flushes are counted three time. Where 
 
 
 
  is the number of boards containing five cards that make exactly two straight flushes and 
 
 
 
  is the number of boards containing five cards that make exactly three straight flushes, then the frequency 
 
 
 
  of boards that make a straight flush on the river is



The probabilities of making a straight flush are the same for any two starting hands that can make a straight flush with exactly two straight flush sequences that contain no overlap. So  (which makes a straight flush with either  or ) and  have the same probabilities on the flop, turn and river. Likewise,  (which makes a straight flush with either  or ) and  each make a straight flush with one of two straight flush sequences, with two cards overlapping.
A complete straight flush hand pattern is then the number of straight flush sequences for the hand combined with the overlaps between all of the straight flush sequences. The following rules can be used to derive a notation for describing complete straight flush hand patterns:

Label each element in each straight flush sequence according to the number of straight flush sequences that contain it.
Sort the labelled elements of each straight flush sequence to derive the labeled straight flush sequence. Arbitrarily, choose to sort the elements in descending order.
Sort the labelled straight flush sequences. Arbitrarily, choose to sort the straight flush sequences in descending order.

Each element can be either the low, middle, or high rank of a straight flush sequence. Using numbers to label the straight flush sequence elements, each element in a straight flush sequence is assigned a label from 1–3 depending on whether it appears in 1, 2 or 3 straight flush sequences. For example, the two straight flush sequences for a hand  and  are labelled as 111 and 111 since each element appears in only a single straight flush sequence, and the straight flush hand pattern is 111+111. The two straight flush sequences  and  are labelled as 221 and 221, and the straight flush hand pattern is 221+221.
To determine the probability of making a straight flush from any starting hand, first identify all of the straight flush hand patterns, and then determine the probabilities for each hand pattern. It turns out that there are 32 hand patterns possible using a single suit to make the straight flush, with either 2, 3, or 4 cards from the suit being used to make straight flushes. The following table shows each of the single-suit straight flush hand patterns, listed in order of probability of making a straight flush on the river, from highest to lowest probability.

Of the 32 hand patterns that can make a straight flush in one suit, four of the hand patterns (111, 211+211, 322+321+321, and 332+332+321+321) use exactly two cards in the suit. For hands that can make a straight flush in two suits, each of these hand patterns can be used by one of the two suits. This gives 
 
 
different combinations of single suit hand patterns for making a straight flush in one of two suits. There is no overlap in the straight flush sequences between suits and it is not possible to make a straight flush in more than one suit. Therefore, where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the probabilities of making a flush in each of the two suits, then the probability 
 
 
 
  of making a straight flush in either suit is 
 
 
 
 
 . The following table gives the double-suit straight flush hand patterns, listed in order of probability of making a straight flush on the river, from highest to lowest probability.

Making a straight

See the section "Starting hands for straights" for a description of starting hands for straights and sequence types.


The probability of making a straight depends on how many different arrangements of three ranks can make a straight when combined with two ranks from the hand (the sequence type of the hand) and the probability of each of those arrangements occurring. The probability of an arrangement of three ranks appearing depends on the number of cards available for each rank. There are four different possibilities for the cards available for the three ranks based on how the ranks overlap with cards in the hand:

There is no overlap between the three ranks and the ranks in the hand. Every hand that can make a straight has at least one set of three ranks with no overlap that makes a straight.
One of the three ranks is the same as the rank of an unpaired rank in the hand. This is possible when the hand has three ranks that are part of a straight, such as {5, 6, 9}, which are part of the straight 5-6-7-8-9.
One of the three ranks is the same as the rank of a paired rank in the hand. For example, the hand  makes a straight with {4, 5, 7}.
Two of the three ranks are the same as the ranks of unpaired ranks in the hand. This is possible when the hand is four different ranks that are part of a straight, such as the hand {6-7-8-9}, which is part of the straights 5-6-7-8-9 and 6-7-8-9-T.

Naming these rank sets based on the number of cards available for each rank gives the rank sets 444, 443, 442 and 433, respectively. The number of ways to make each three-card straight rank set are:

To calculate the probability of a hand making a straight it is necessary to first determine the number of rank sets of each type can make a straight. If 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the number of rank sets of the respective types that make a straight, then ignoring straight flushes, the number of combinations that produce a straight for the hand is



To account for straight flushes simply subtract the number of rank sets that produce a straight flush from the total. The hand with the best probability for making a straight is a hand with a sequence type of 20, consisting of four consecutive ranks from 4-5-6-7 to 8-9-T-J. These hands have two rank sets of type 444, six ranks sets of type 443 and twelve of type 433, giving (2 × 64) + (6 × 48) + (12 × 36) = 848 different three-card combinations that produce a straight.
To make a straight on the flop, all three cards must be different ranks in the rank set. This gives the probability



That gives a hand of sequence type 20 with four different suits (thus no chance for a straight flush) a probability of approximately 4.9% of making a straight on the flop.

Notes


The odds presented in this article use the notation x : 1 which translates to x to 1 odds against the event happening. The odds are calculated from the probability p of the event happening using the formula: odds = [(1 − p) ÷ p] : 1, or odds = [(1 ÷ p) − 1] : 1. Another way of expressing the odds x : 1 is to state that there is a 1 in x+1 chance of the event occurring or the probability of the event occurring is 1 ÷ (x + 1). So for example, the odds of a role of a fair six-sided die coming up three is 5 : 1 against because there are 5 chances for a number other than three and 1 chance for a three; alternatively, this could be described as a 1 in 6 chance or 
 
 
 
  probability of a three being rolled because the three is 1 of 6 equally-likely possible outcomes.
