Max-plus algebra

A max-plus algebra is a semiring over the union of real numbers and ε = 
 
 
 
 , equipped with maximum and addition as the two binary operations. It can be used appropriately to determine marking times within a given Petri net and a vector filled with marking state at the beginning.
Operators
Scalar operations
Let a and b be real scalars or ε. Then the operations maximum (implied by the max operator 
 
 
 
 ) and addition (plus operator 
 
 
 
 ) for these scalars are defined as






Watch: Max-operator 
 
 
 
  can easily be confused with the addition operation. Similar to the conventional algebra, all 
 
 
 
  - operations have a higher precedence than 
 
 
 
  - operations.
Matrix operations
Max-plus algebra can be used for matrix operands A, B likewise, where the size of both matrices is the same. To perform the A

B - operation, the elements of the resulting matrix at (row i, column j) have to be set up by the maximum operation of both corresponding elements of the matrices A and B:



The 
 
 
 
  - operation is similar to the algorithm of Matrix multiplication, however, every "+" calculation has to be substituted by an 
 
 
 
  - operation and every "
 
 
 
 " calculation by a 
 
 
 
  - operation. More precisely, to perform the A

B - operation, where A is a m×p matrix and B is a p×n matrix, the elements of the resulting matrix at (row i, column j) are determined by matrices A (row i) and B (column j):



Useful enhancement elements
In order to handle marking times like 
 
 
 
  which means "never before", the ε-element has been established by ε
 
 
 
 . According to the idea of infinity, the following equations can be found:

ε 
 
 
 
  a = a
 
ε 
 
 
 
  a = ε
 

To point the zero number out, the element e was defined by 
 
 
 
 . Therefore:

e

a = a


Obviously, ε is the neutral element for the 
 
 
 
  - operation, as e is for the 
 
 
 
  - operation
