   Max-plus algebra      Max-plus algebra   A max-plus algebra is a semiring over the union of real numbers and ε =    -  ∞         -\infty   , equipped with maximum and addition as the two binary operations. It can be used appropriately to determine marking times within a given Petri net and a vector filled with marking state at the beginning.  Operators  Scalar operations  Let a and b be real scalars or ε. Then the operations maximum (implied by the max operator   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   ) and addition ( plus operator   ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   ) for these scalars are defined as       a  ⊕  b   =   max   (  a  ,  b  )         direct-sum  a  b     a  b     a\oplus b=\max(a,b)          a  ⊗  b   =   a  +  b        tensor-product  a  b     a  b     a\otimes b=a+b     Watch : Max-operator   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   can easily be confused with the addition operation. Similar to the conventional algebra, all   ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   - operations have a higher precedence than   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   - operations.  Matrix operations  Max-plus algebra can be used for matrix operands A , B likewise, where the size of both matrices is the same. To perform the A    ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus    B - operation, the elements of the resulting matrix at (row i, column j) have to be set up by the maximum operation of both corresponding elements of the matrices A and B :        [   A  ⊕  B   ]    i  j    =     [  A  ]    i  j    ⊕    [  B  ]    i  j     =   max   (    [  A  ]    i  j    ,    [  B  ]    i  j    )           subscript   delimited-[]   direct-sum  A  B      i  j     direct-sum   subscript   delimited-[]  A     i  j     subscript   delimited-[]  B     i  j             subscript   delimited-[]  A     i  j     subscript   delimited-[]  B     i  j        [A\oplus B]_{ij}=[A]_{ij}\oplus[B]_{ij}=\max([A]_{ij},[B]_{ij})     The   ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   - operation is similar to the algorithm of Matrix multiplication , however, every "+" calculation has to be substituted by an   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   - operation and every "   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   " calculation by a   ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   - operation. More precisely, to perform the A    ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes    B - operation, where A is a m × p matrix and B is a p × n matrix, the elements of the resulting matrix at (row i, column j) are determined by matrices A (row i) and B (column j):        [   A  ⊗  B   ]    i  j    =    ⊕   k  =  1   p    (     [  A  ]    i  k    ⊗    [  B  ]    k  j     )    =   max   (     [  A  ]    i  1    +    [  B  ]    1  j     ,  …  ,     [  A  ]    i  p    +    [  B  ]    p  j     )           subscript   delimited-[]   tensor-product  A  B      i  j      superscript   subscript  direct-sum    k  1    p    tensor-product   subscript   delimited-[]  A     i  k     subscript   delimited-[]  B     k  j                subscript   delimited-[]  A     i  1     subscript   delimited-[]  B     1  j     normal-…     subscript   delimited-[]  A     i  p     subscript   delimited-[]  B     p  j         [A\otimes B]_{ij}=\bigoplus_{k=1}^{p}([A]_{ik}\otimes[B]_{kj})=\max([A]_{i1}+[%
 B]_{1j},\dots,[A]_{ip}+[B]_{pj})     Useful enhancement elements  In order to handle marking times like    -  ∞         -\infty   which means "never before", the ε-element has been established by ε     =   -  ∞       absent        =-\infty   . According to the idea of infinity, the following equations can be found:   ε   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   a = a  ε   ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   a = ε   To point the zero number out, the element e was defined by    e  =  0      e  0    e=0   . Therefore:   e    ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes    a = a    Obviously, ε is the neutral element for the   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   - operation, as e is for the   ⊗   tensor-product   \otimes   - operation  Algebra properties   associativity:           (   a  ⊕  b   )   ⊕  c   =   a  ⊕   (   b  ⊕  c   )         direct-sum   direct-sum  a  b   c    direct-sum  a   direct-sum  b  c      (a\oplus b)\oplus c=a\oplus(b\oplus c)                (   a  ⊗  b   )   ⊗  c   =   a  ⊗   (   b  ⊗  c   )         tensor-product   tensor-product  a  b   c    tensor-product  a   tensor-product  b  c      (a\otimes b)\otimes c=a\otimes(b\otimes c)         commutativity :          a  ⊕  b   =   b  ⊕  a        direct-sum  a  b    direct-sum  b  a     a\oplus b=b\oplus a               a  ⊗  b   =   b  ⊗  a        tensor-product  a  b    tensor-product  b  a     a\otimes b=b\otimes a         distributivity:           (   a  ⊕  b   )   ⊗  c   =    a  ⊗  c   ⊕   b  ⊗  c         tensor-product   direct-sum  a  b   c    direct-sum   tensor-product  a  c    tensor-product  b  c      (a\oplus b)\otimes c=a\otimes c\oplus b\otimes c         zero element :          a  ⊕  ε   =  a       direct-sum  a  ε   a    a\oplus\varepsilon=a         unit element:          a  ⊗  e   =  a       tensor-product  a  e   a    a\otimes e=a         idempotency of   ⊕   direct-sum   \oplus   :          a  ⊕  a   =  a       direct-sum  a  a   a    a\oplus a=a        See also   Tropical geometry   Additional reading     External links   http://maxplus.org  http://amadeus.inria.fr/gaubert/maxplus.html  http://press.princeton.edu/titles/8120.html   fr:Algèbre max-plus "  Category:Algebras
