Median algebra

In mathematics, a median algebra is a set with a ternary operation

 
  satisfying a set of axioms which generalise the notion of median or majority function, as a Boolean function.
The axioms are














The second and third axioms imply commutativity: it is possible (but not easy) to show that in the presence of the other three, axiom (3) is redundant. The fourth axiom implies associativity. There are other possible axiom systems: for example the two








also suffice.
In a Boolean algebra, or more generally a distributive lattice, the median function 
 
 
 
  satisfies these axioms, so that every Boolean algebra and every distributive lattice forms a median algebra.
Birkhoff and Kiss showed that a median algebra with elements 0 and 1 satisfying  = x is a distributive lattice.
Relation to median graphs
A median graph is an undirected graph in which for every three vertices x, y, and z there is a unique vertex  that belongs to shortest paths between any two of x, y, and z. If this is the case, then the operation  defines a median algebra having the vertices of the graph as its elements.
Conversely, in any median algebra, one may define an interval [x, z] to be the set of elements y such that  = y. One may define a graph from a median algebra by creating a vertex for each algebra element and an edge for each pair (x, z) such that the interval [x, z] contains no other elements. If the algebra has the property that every interval is finite, then this graph is a median graph, and it accurately represents the algebra in that the median operation defined by shortest paths on the graph coincides with the algebra's original median operation.
