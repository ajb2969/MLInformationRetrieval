   Median algebra      Median algebra   In mathematics , a median algebra is a set with a ternary operation     ⟨  x  ,  y  ,  z  ⟩     x  y  z    \langle x,y,z\rangle   satisfying a set of axioms which generalise the notion of median or majority function , as a Boolean function .  The axioms are        ⟨  x  ,  y  ,  y  ⟩   =  y       x  y  y   y    \langle x,y,y\rangle=y          ⟨  x  ,  y  ,  z  ⟩   =   ⟨  z  ,  x  ,  y  ⟩        x  y  z    z  x  y     \langle x,y,z\rangle=\langle z,x,y\rangle          ⟨  x  ,  y  ,  z  ⟩   =   ⟨  x  ,  z  ,  y  ⟩        x  y  z    x  z  y     \langle x,y,z\rangle=\langle x,z,y\rangle          ⟨   ⟨  x  ,  w  ,  y  ⟩   ,  w  ,  z  ⟩   =   ⟨  x  ,  w  ,   ⟨  y  ,  w  ,  z  ⟩   ⟩         x  w  y   w  z    x  w   y  w  z      \langle\langle x,w,y\rangle,w,z\rangle=\langle x,w,\langle y,w,z\rangle\rangle      The second and third axioms imply commutativity : it is possible (but not easy) to show that in the presence of the other three, axiom (3) is redundant. The fourth axiom implies associativity. There are other possible axiom systems: for example the two        ⟨  x  ,  y  ,  y  ⟩   =  y       x  y  y   y    \langle x,y,y\rangle=y          ⟨  u  ,  v  ,   ⟨  u  ,  w  ,  x  ⟩   ⟩   =   ⟨  u  ,  x  ,   ⟨  w  ,  u  ,  v  ⟩   ⟩        u  v   u  w  x     u  x   w  u  v      \langle u,v,\langle u,w,x\rangle\rangle=\langle u,x,\langle w,u,v\rangle\rangle      also suffice.  In a Boolean algebra , or more generally a distributive lattice , the median function     ⟨  x  ,  y  ,  z  ⟩   =    (   x  ∨  y   )   ∧   (   y  ∨  z   )   ∧   (   z  ∨  x   )         x  y  z       x  y     y  z     z  x      \langle x,y,z\rangle=(x\vee y)\wedge(y\vee z)\wedge(z\vee x)   satisfies these axioms, so that every Boolean algebra and every distributive lattice forms a median algebra.  Birkhoff and Kiss showed that a median algebra with elements 0 and 1 satisfying  = x is a distributive lattice .  Relation to median graphs  A median graph is an undirected graph in which for every three vertices x , y , and z there is a unique vertex  that belongs to shortest paths between any two of x , y , and z . If this is the case, then the operation  defines a median algebra having the vertices of the graph as its elements.  Conversely, in any median algebra, one may define an interval [ x , z ] to be the set of elements y such that  = y . One may define a graph from a median algebra by creating a vertex for each algebra element and an edge for each pair ( x , z ) such that the interval [ x , z ] contains no other elements. If the algebra has the property that every interval is finite, then this graph is a median graph, and it accurately represents the algebra in that the median operation defined by shortest paths on the graph coincides with the algebra's original median operation.
