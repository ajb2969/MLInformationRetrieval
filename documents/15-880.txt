Acrylyl-CoA reductase (NADPH)

Acrylyl-CoA reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme with system name propanoyl-CoA:NADP+ oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

propanoyl-CoA + NADP+

 
  acryloyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


This enzyme catalyses a step in the 3-hydroxypropionate/4-hydroxybutyrate cycle, an autotrophic CO2 fixation pathway found in some Thermoacidophilic archaea.
