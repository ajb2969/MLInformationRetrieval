   Sinc numerical methods      Sinc numerical methods   In numerical analysis and applied mathematics , sinc numerical methods are numerical techniques 1 for finding approximate solutions of partial differential equations and integral equations based on the translates of sinc function and Cardinal function C(f,h) which is an expansion of f defined by       C   (  f  ,  h  )    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞    f   (   k  h   )   sinc   (    x  h   -  k   )           C   f  h   x     superscript   subscript     k            f    k  h   sinc      x  h   k       C(f,h)(x)=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}f(kh)\,\textrm{sinc}\left(\dfrac{x}{h}-k\right)   where the step size h>0 and where the sinc function is defined by       sinc   (  x  )    =    sin   (   π  x   )     π  x          sinc  x         π  x      π  x      \textrm{sinc}(x)=\frac{\sin(\pi x)}{\pi x}   Sinc approximation methods excel for problems whose solutions may have singularities, or infinite domains, or boundary layers.  The truncated Sinc expansion of f is defined by the following series:        C   M  ,  N     (  f  ,  h  )    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =   -  M    N    f   (   k  h   )   sinc   (    x  h   -  k   )            subscript  C   M  N     f  h   x     superscript   subscript     k    M     N     f    k  h   sinc      x  h   k       C_{M,N}(f,h)(x)=\displaystyle\sum_{k=-M}^{N}f(kh)\,\textrm{sinc}\left(\dfrac{x%
 }{h}-k\right)   .  Sinc numerical methods cover   function approximation,  approximation of derivatives ,  approximate definite and indefinite integration ,  approximate solution of initial and boundary value ordinary differential equation (ODE) problems,  approximation and inversion of Fourier and Laplace transforms,  approximation of Hilbert transforms ,  approximation of definite and indefinite convolution ,  approximate solution of partial differential equations,  approximate solution of integral equations ,  construction of conformal maps.   Indeed, Sinc are ubiquitous for approximating every operation of calculus  In the standard setup of the sinc numerical methods, the errors (in big O notation ) are known to be    O   (   e   -   c   n      )       O   superscript  e      c    n        O\left(e^{-c\sqrt{n}}\right)   with some c>0, where n is the number of nodes or bases used in the methods. However, Sugihara 2 has recently found that the errors in the Sinc numerical methods based on double exponential transformation are    O   (   e   -    k  n    ln  n      )       O   superscript  e        k  n     n        O\left(e^{-\frac{kn}{\ln n}}\right)   with some k>0, in a setup that is also meaningful both theoretically and practically and are found to be best possible in a certain mathematical sense.
