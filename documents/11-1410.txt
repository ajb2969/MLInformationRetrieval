   2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase      2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase   In enzymology , a 2-dehydro-3-deoxygluconokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 6-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate , whereas its two products are ADP and 6-phospho-2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate 6-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxygluconokinase , 2-keto-3-deoxy-D-gluconic acid kinase , 2-keto-3-deoxygluconokinase (phosphorylating) , 2-keto-3-deoxygluconate kinase , and ketodeoxygluconokinase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway and pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
