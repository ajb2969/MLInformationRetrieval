Draft:Suslin homology

In mathematics, the Suslin homology is a homology theory attached to algebraic varieties. By definition, given an abelian group A and a scheme X of finite type over a field k, the theory is given by


1 where C is a free abelian group generated by integral subschemes of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an i-simplex, that are finite and surjective over 
 
 
 
 
 .
