   Draft:Suslin homology      Draft:Suslin homology   In mathematics, the Suslin homology is a homology theory attached to algebraic varieties. By definition, given an abelian group A and a scheme X of finite type over a field k , the theory is given by        H  i    (  X  ,  A  )    =    Tor  i  ℤ    (  C  ,  A  )           subscript  H  i    X  A      superscript   subscript  Tor  i   ℤ   C  A     H_{i}(X,A)=\operatorname{Tor}_{i}^{\mathbb{Z}}(C,A)    1 where C is a free abelian group generated by integral subschemes of     △  i   ×  X       superscript  normal-△  i   X    \triangle^{i}\times X   , where    △  i     superscript  normal-△  i    \triangle^{i}   is an i -simplex, that are finite and surjective over    △  i     superscript  normal-△  i    \triangle^{i}   .
