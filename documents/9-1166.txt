   Eötvös rule      Eötvös rule   (Figure)  Temperature dependence of the surface tension of benzene   The Eötvös rule , named after the Hungarian physicist Loránd (Roland) Eötvös (1848–1919) enables the prediction of the surface tension of an arbitrary liquid pure substance at all temperatures . The density , molar mass and the critical temperature of the liquid have to be known. At the critical point the surface tension is zero.  The first assumption of the Eötvös rule is:  1. The surface tension is a linear function of the temperature.   This assumption is approximately fulfilled for most known liquids. When plotting the surface tension versus the temperature a fairly straight line can be seen which has a surface tension of zero at the critical temperature.   The Eötvös rule also gives a relation of the surface tension behaviour of different liquids in respect to each other:  2. The temperature dependence of the surface tension can be plotted for all liquids in a way that the data collapses to a single master curve. To do so either the molar mass, the density, or the molar volume of the corresponding liquid has to be known.  The Eötvös rule  If V is the molar volume and T c the critical temperature of a liquid the surface tension γ is given by 1       γ   V   2  /  3     =   k   (    T  c   -  T   )          γ   superscript  V    2  3       k     subscript  T  c   T      \gamma V^{2/3}=k(T_{c}-T)\,   where k is a constant valid for all liquids. The Eötvös constant has a value of 2.1×10 −7  J /(K· mol 2/3 ).  More precise values can be gained when considering that the line normally passes the temperature axis 6 K before the critical point:       γ   V   2  /  3     =   k   (    T  c   -    6   K   -  T   )          γ   superscript  V    2  3       k     subscript  T  c     6  normal-K   T      \gamma V^{2/3}=k(T_{c}-6\ \mathrm{K}-T)\,     The molar volume V is given by the molar mass M and the density ρ      V  =   M  /   ρ        V    M  ρ     V=M/\rho\,     The term    γ   V   2  /  3        γ   superscript  V    2  3      \gamma V^{2/3}   is also referred to as the "molar surface tension" γ mol :       γ   m  o  l    =   γ    V   2  /  3           subscript  γ    m  o  l      γ   superscript  V    2  3       \gamma_{mol}=\gamma V^{2/3}\,     A useful representation that prevents the use of the unit mol −2/3 is given by the Avogadro constant N A :      γ  =    k  ′     (   M   ρ   N  A     )    -   2  /  3      (    T  c   -    6   K   -  T   )    =    k  ′     (    N  A   V   )    2  /  3     (    T  c   -    6   K   -  T   )          γ     superscript  k  normal-′    superscript    M    ρ   subscript  N  A         2  3        subscript  T  c     6  normal-K   T            superscript  k  normal-′    superscript     subscript  N  A   V     2  3       subscript  T  c     6  normal-K   T       \gamma=k^{\prime}\left(\frac{M}{\rho N_{A}}\right)^{-2/3}(T_{c}-6\ \mathrm{K}-%
 T)=k^{\prime}\left(\frac{N_{A}}{V}\right)^{2/3}(T_{c}-6\ \mathrm{K}-T)     As John Lennard-Jones and Corner showed in 1940 by means of the statistical mechanics the constant k ′ is nearly equal to the Boltzmann constant .  Water  For water, the following equation is valid between 0 and 100 °C.      γ  =      0.07275   N   /  m   ⋅   (   1  -   0.002  ⋅   (   T  -    291   K    )     )        γ   normal-⋅      0.07275  normal-N   normal-m     1   normal-⋅  0.002    T    291  normal-K         \gamma=0.07275\ \mathrm{N/m}\cdot(1-0.002\cdot(T-291\ \mathrm{K}))     Historical  As a student, Eötvös started to research surface tension and developed a new method for its determination. The Eötvös rule was first found phenomenologically and published in 1886. 2 In 1893 William Ramsay and Shields showed an improved version considering that the line normally passes the temperature axis 6 K before the critical point. John Lennard-Jones and Corner published (1940) a derivation of the equation by means of statistical mechanics . In 1945 E. A. Guggenheim gave a further improved variant of the equation.
