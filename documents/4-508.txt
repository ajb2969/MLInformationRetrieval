Lucas sequence

In mathematics, the Lucas sequences Un(P,Q) and Vn(P,Q) are certain integer sequences that satisfy the recurrence relation

xn = P xn−1 − Q xn−2


where P and Q are fixed integers. Any other sequence satisfying this recurrence relation can be represented as a linear combination of the Lucas sequences Un(P,Q) and Vn(P,Q).
More generally, Lucas sequences Un(P,Q) and Vn(P,Q) represent sequences of polynomials in P and Q with integer coefficients.
Famous examples of Lucas sequences include the Fibonacci numbers, Mersenne numbers, Pell numbers, Lucas numbers, Jacobsthal numbers, and a superset of Fermat numbers. Lucas sequences are named after the French mathematician Édouard Lucas.
Recurrence relations
Given two integer parameters P and Q, the Lucas sequences of the first kind Un(P,Q) and of the second kind Vn(P,Q) are defined by the recurrence relations:









and









It is not hard to show that for 
 
 
 
 ,






Examples
Initial terms of Lucas sequences Un(P,Q) and Vn(P,Q) are given in the table:






















































































































Algebraic relations
The characteristic equation of the recurrence relation for Lucas sequences 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is:



It has the discriminant

 
  and the roots:



Thus:









Note that the sequence 
 
 
 
  and the sequence 
 
 
 
  also satisfy the recurrence relation. However these might not be integer sequences.
Distinct roots
When 
 
 
 
 , a and b are distinct and one quickly verifies that





 
 .
It follows that the terms of Lucas sequences can be expressed in terms of a and b as follows






Repeated root
The case 
 
 
 
  occurs exactly when 
 
 
 
  for some integer S so that 
 
 
 
 . In this case one easily finds that

Additional sequences having the same discriminant
If the Lucas sequences 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have discriminant 
 
 
 
 , then the sequences based on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  where





 
  have the same discriminant
 
 
 
 .
Other relations
The terms of Lucas sequences satisfy relations that are generalizations of those between Fibonacci numbers

 
  and Lucas numbers

 
 . For example:




General

P = 1, Q = -1

































































Among the consequences is that 
 
 
 
  is a multiple of 
 
 
 
 , i.e., the sequence 
 
 
 
  is a divisibility sequence. This implies, in particular, that 
 
 
 
  can be prime only when n is prime. Another consequence is an analog of exponentiation by squaring that allows fast computation of 
 
 
 
  for large values of n. These facts are used in the Lucas–Lehmer primality test.
Carmichael's theorem states that all but finitely many of the terms in a Lucas sequence have a prime factor that does not divide any earlier term in the sequence .
Specific names
The Lucas sequences for some values of P and Q have specific names:

Un(1,−1) : Fibonacci numbers

Vn(1,−1) : Lucas numbers

Un(2,−1) : Pell numbers

Vn(2,−1) : Companion Pell numbers or Pell-Lucas numbers
 
Un(1,−2) : Jacobsthal numbers

Vn(1,−2) : Jacobsthal-Lucas numbers

Un(3, 2) : Mersenne numbers 2n − 1
 
Vn(3, 2) : Numbers of the form 2n + 1, which include the Fermat numbers .
 
Un(x,−1) : Fibonacci polynomials

Vn(x,−1) : Lucas polynomials

Un(x+1, x) : Repunits base x

Vn(x+1, x) : xn + 1
 

Some Lucas sequences have entries in the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences:

Applications

Lucas sequences are used in probabilistic Lucas pseudoprime tests, which are part of the commonly used Baillie-PSW primality test.


Lucas sequences are used in some primality proof methods, including the Lucas-Lehmer-Riesel test, and the N+1 and hybrid N-1/N+1 methods such as those in Brillhart-Lehmer-Selfridge 19751


LUC is a public-key cryptosystem based on Lucas sequences2 that implements the analogs of ElGamal (LUCELG), Diffie-Hellman (LUCDIF), and RSA (LUCRSA). The encryption of the message in LUC is computed as a term of certain Lucas sequence, instead of using modular exponentiation as in RSA or Diffie-Hellman. However, a paper by Bleichenbacher et al.3 shows that many of the supposed security advantages of LUC over cryptosystems based on modular exponentiation are either not present, or not as substantial as claimed.
