   3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase      3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase   In enzymology , a 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tetrahydrofolate + 2-dehydropantoate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate , 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are tetrahydrofolate and 2-dehydropantoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the hydroxymethyl-, formyl- and related transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate hydroxymethyltransferase . Other names in common use include alpha-ketoisovalerate hydroxymethyltransferase , dehydropantoate hydroxymethyltransferase , ketopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase , oxopantoate hydroxymethyltransferase , 5,10-methylene tetrahydrofolate:alpha-ketoisovalerate , and hydroxymethyltransferase . This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
