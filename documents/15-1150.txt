Indole-3-pyruvate monooxygenase

Indole-3-pyruvate monooxygenase (, YUC2 (gene), spi1 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name indole-3-pyruvate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (1-hydroxylating, decarboxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(indol-3-yl)pyruvate + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  (indol-3-yl)acetate + NADP+ + H2O + CO2


Indole-3-pyruvate monooxygenase is a plant enzyme.
