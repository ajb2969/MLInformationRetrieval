Reflexive sheaf

In algebraic geometry, a reflexive sheaf is a coherent sheaf that is isomorphic to its second dual (as a sheaf of modules) via the canonical map. The second dual of a coherent sheaf is called the reflexive hull of the sheaf. A basic example of a reflexive sheaf is a locally free sheaf and, in practice, a reflexive sheaf is thought of as a kind of a vector bundle modulo some singularity. The notion is important both in scheme theory and complex algebraic geometry.
A reflexive sheaf is torsion-free. The dual of a coherent sheaf is reflexive.1 Usually, the product of reflexive sheaves is defined as the reflexive hull of their tensor products (so the result is reflexive.)
A coherent sheaf F is said to be "normal" in the sense of Barth if the restriction 
 
 
 
  is bijective for every open subset U and a closed subset Y of U of codimension at least 2. With this terminology, a coherent sheaf on an integral normal scheme is reflexive if and only if it is torsion-free and normal in the sense of Barth.2 A reflexive sheaf of rank one on an integral locally factorial scheme is invertible.3
A divisorial sheaf on a scheme X is a rank-one reflexive sheaf that is locally free at the generic points of the conductor DX of X.4
