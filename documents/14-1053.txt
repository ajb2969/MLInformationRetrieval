   Kummer's congruence      Kummer's congruence   In mathematics , Kummer's congruences are some congruences involving Bernoulli numbers , found by .  used Kummer's congruences to define the p-adic zeta function .  Statement  The simplest form of Kummer's congruence states that        B  h   h   ≡    B  k   k    (   mod  p   )   whenever  h  ≡  k   (   mod   p  -  1    )      fragments     subscript  B  h   h       subscript  B  k   k    pmod  p   whenever  h   k   pmod    p  1      \frac{B_{h}}{h}\equiv\frac{B_{k}}{k}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)\text{ whenever }%
 h\equiv k\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p-1)   where p is a prime, h and k are positive even integers not divisible by p −1 and the numbers B h are Bernoulli numbers .  More generally if h and k are positive even integers not divisible by p − 1, then        (   1  -   p   h  -  1     )     B  h   h    ≡     (   1  -   p   k  -  1     )     B  k   k       (   mod   p   a  +  1     )            1   superscript  p    h  1        subscript  B  h   h     annotated      1   superscript  p    k  1        subscript  B  k   k     pmod   superscript  p    a  1        (1-p^{h-1})\frac{B_{h}}{h}\equiv(1-p^{k-1})\frac{B_{k}}{k}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod%
 }}p^{a+1})   whenever      h  ≡   k     (   mod   φ   (   p   a  +  1    )     )        h   annotated  k   pmod    φ   superscript  p    a  1         h\equiv k\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\varphi(p^{a+1}))     where φ( p a +1 ) is the Euler totient function , evaluated at p a +1 and a is a non negative integer. At a = 0, the expression takes the simpler form, as seen above. The two sides of the Kummer congruence are essentially values of the p-adic zeta function , and the Kummer congruences imply that the p -adic zeta function for negative integers is continuous, so can be extended by continuity to all p -adic integers.
