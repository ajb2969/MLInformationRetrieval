   Lacto-N-biosidase      Lacto-N-biosidase   Lacto-N-biosidase () is an enzyme with system name oligosaccharide lacto-N-biosylhydrolase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-D-GlcNAc + beta-D-Gal-(1->4)-D-Glc  (2) lacto-N-tetraose + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   lacto-N-biose + lactose    The enzyme from Streptomyces specifically hydrolyses the terminal lacto-N-biosyl residue (beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-D-GlcNAc) from the non-reducing end of oligosaccharides with the structure beta-D-Gal-(1->3)-beta-D-GlcNAc-(1->3)-beta-D-Gal-(1->R).
