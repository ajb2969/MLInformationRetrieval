<h1>Mirror</h1>
<hr/>
<p> </p>
<p>A <strong>mirror</strong> is an object that <a href="Reflection_(physics)" title="wikilink">reflects</a> light in such a way that, for incident light in some range of wavelengths, the reflected light preserves many or most of the detailed physical characteristics of the original light. This is different from other light-reflecting objects that do not preserve much of the original wave signal other than color and diffuse reflected light.</p>
<p>The most familiar type of mirror is the <a href="plane_mirror" title="wikilink">plane mirror</a>, which has a flat screen surface. <a href="Curved_mirror" title="wikilink">Curved mirrors</a> are also used, to produce <a href="magnification" title="wikilink">magnified</a> or diminished images or focus light or simply distort the reflected image.</p>
<p>Mirrors are commonly used for <a href="personal_grooming" title="wikilink">personal grooming</a> or admiring oneself (in which case the <a href="Archaism" title="wikilink">archaic term</a> <strong>looking-glass</strong> is sometimes still used), decoration, and architecture. Mirrors are also used in scientific apparatus such as <a href="telescope" title="wikilink">telescopes</a> and <a href="laser" title="wikilink">lasers</a>, cameras, and industrial machinery. Most mirrors are designed for <a href="visible_light" title="wikilink">visible light</a>; however, mirrors designed for other <a href="wavelength" title="wikilink">wavelengths</a> of <a href="electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikilink">electromagnetic radiation</a> are also used.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>  The first mirrors used by people were most likely pools of dark, still water, or water collected in a primitive vessel of some sort. The earliest manufactured mirrors were pieces of polished stone such as <a class="uri" href="obsidian" title="wikilink">obsidian</a>, a naturally occurring <a href="volcanic_glass" title="wikilink">volcanic glass</a>. Examples of obsidian mirrors found in <a class="uri" href="Anatolia" title="wikilink">Anatolia</a> (modern-day Turkey) have been dated to around 6000 BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Polished stone mirrors from Central and South America date from around 2000 BC onwards.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> Mirrors of polished copper were crafted in <a class="uri" href="Mesopotamia" title="wikilink">Mesopotamia</a> from 4000 BC,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> and in ancient Egypt from around 3000 BC.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In China, <a href="bronze_mirror" title="wikilink">bronze mirrors</a> were manufactured from around 2000 BC,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> some of the earliest bronze and copper examples being produced by the <a href="Qijia_culture" title="wikilink">Qijia culture</a>. Mirrors made of other metal mixtures (<a href="alloy" title="wikilink">alloys</a>) such as copper and tin <a href="speculum_metal" title="wikilink">speculum metal</a> may have also been produced in China and India.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Mirrors of speculum metal or any precious metal were hard to produce and were only owned by the wealthy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<p>Metal-coated glass mirrors are said to have been invented in <a class="uri" href="Sidon" title="wikilink">Sidon</a> (modern-day Lebanon) in the first century AD,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and glass mirrors backed with <a href="gold_leaf" title="wikilink">gold leaf</a> are mentioned by the Roman author <a href="Pliny_the_Elder" title="wikilink">Pliny</a> in his <em><a href="Natural_History_(Pliny)" title="wikilink">Natural History</a></em>, written in about 77 AD.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> The Romans also developed a technique for creating crude mirrors by coating blown glass with molten lead.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Parabolic_mirror" title="wikilink">Parabolic mirrors</a> were described and studied in <a href="classical_antiquity" title="wikilink">classical antiquity</a> by the mathematician <a href="Diocles_(mathematician)" title="wikilink">Diocles</a> in his work <em>On Burning Mirrors</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="Ptolemy" title="wikilink">Ptolemy</a> conducted a number of experiments with curved polished iron mirrors,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> and discussed plane, convex spherical, and concave spherical mirrors in his <em>Optics</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="Parabolic_mirror" title="wikilink">Parabolic mirrors</a> were also described by the physicist <a href="Ibn_Sahl" title="wikilink">Ibn Sahl</a> in the 10th century,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> and <a href="Ibn_al-Haytham" title="wikilink">Ibn al-Haytham</a> discussed <a href="Curved_mirror" title="wikilink">concave and convex mirrors</a> in both <a href="Cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylindrical</a> and <a href="Spherical_geometry" title="wikilink">spherical geometries</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> carried out a number of experiments with mirrors, and solved the problem of finding the point on a convex mirror at which a ray coming from one point is reflected to another point.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> By the 11th century, clear glass mirrors were being produced in <a href="Al-Andalus" title="wikilink">Moorish Spain</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>In China, people began making mirrors with the use of silver-mercury <a href="amalgam_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">amalgams</a> as early as 500 AD.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> Some time during the early <a class="uri" href="Renaissance" title="wikilink">Renaissance</a>, European manufacturers perfected a superior method of coating glass with a tin-mercury amalgam. The exact date and location of the discovery is unknown, but in the 16th century, <a class="uri" href="Venice" title="wikilink">Venice</a>, a city famed for its glass-making expertise, became a centre of mirror production using this new technique. Glass mirrors from this period were extremely expensive luxuries.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The <a class="uri" href="Saint-Gobain" title="wikilink">Saint-Gobain</a> factory, founded by royal initiative in France, was an important manufacturer, and <a href="Bohemia" title="wikilink">Bohemian</a> and German glass, often rather cheaper, was also important.</p>
<p>The invention of the <a href="silvering" title="wikilink">silvered-glass</a> mirror is credited to German chemist <a href="Justus_von_Liebig" title="wikilink">Justus von Liebig</a> in 1835.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> His process involved the deposition of a thin layer of metallic silver onto glass through the chemical reduction of <a href="silver_nitrate" title="wikilink">silver nitrate</a>. This <a class="uri" href="silvering" title="wikilink">silvering</a> process was adapted for mass manufacturing and led to the greater availability of affordable mirrors. Nowadays, mirrors are often produced by the <a href="wet_deposition" title="wikilink">wet deposition</a> of silver (or sometimes aluminum via vacuum deposition)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> directly onto the glass substrate.</p>
<h2 id="manufacturing">Manufacturing</h2>
<p>Mirrors are manufactured by applying a <a href="silvering" title="wikilink">reflective coating</a> to a suitable <a href="substrate_(materials_science)" title="wikilink">substrate</a>. The most common substrate is glass, due to its transparency, ease of fabrication, rigidity, hardness, and ability to take a smooth finish. The reflective coating is typically applied to the back surface of the glass, so that the reflecting side of the coating is protected from corrosion and accidental damage by the glass on one side and the coating itself and optional paint for further protection on the other.</p>
<p>In classical antiquity, mirrors were made of solid metal (bronze, later silver) and were too expensive for widespread use by common people; they were also prone to <a class="uri" href="corrosion" title="wikilink">corrosion</a>. Due to the low <a class="uri" href="reflectivity" title="wikilink">reflectivity</a> of polished metal, these mirrors also gave a darker image than modern ones, making them unsuitable for indoor use with the artificial lighting of the time (<a href="candle" title="wikilink">candles</a> or <a href="lantern" title="wikilink">lanterns</a>).</p>
<p>The method of making mirrors out of <a href="flat_glass" title="wikilink">plate glass</a> was invented by 16th-century Venetian glassmakers on the island of <a class="uri" href="Murano" title="wikilink">Murano</a>, who covered the back of the glass with <a href="mercury_(element)" title="wikilink">mercury</a>, obtaining near-perfect and undistorted reflection. For over one hundred years, Venetian mirrors installed in richly decorated frames served as luxury decorations for palaces throughout Europe, but the secret of the mercury process eventually arrived in London and Paris during the 17th century, due to industrial espionage. French workshops succeeded in large scale industrialization of the process, eventually making mirrors affordable to the masses, although mercury's <a class="uri" href="toxicity" title="wikilink">toxicity</a> remained a problem.</p>
<p>In modern times, the mirror <a href="Substrate_(materials_science)" title="wikilink">substrate</a> is shaped, polished and cleaned, and is then coated. Glass mirrors are most often coated with silver<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> or aluminium, implemented by a series of coatings:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="Tin(II)_chloride" title="wikilink">Tin(II) chloride</a></li>
<li>Silver</li>
<li>Chemical <a href="catalyst" title="wikilink">activator</a></li>
<li>Copper</li>
<li><a class="uri" href="Paint" title="wikilink">Paint</a></li>
</ol>
<p>The <a href="tin(II)_chloride" title="wikilink">tin(II) chloride</a> is applied because silver will not bond with the glass. The activator causes the tin/silver to harden. Copper is added for long-term durability.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> The <a class="uri" href="paint" title="wikilink">paint</a> protects the coating on the back of the mirror from scratches and other accidental damage.</p>
<p>In some applications, generally those that are cost-sensitive or that require great durability, mirrors are made from a single, bulk material such as polished metal. For technical applications such as <a class="uri" href="laser" title="wikilink">laser</a> mirrors, the reflective coating is typically applied by <a href="vacuum_deposition" title="wikilink">vacuum deposition</a> on the <em>front</em> surface of the substrate. This eliminates <a class="uri" href="refraction" title="wikilink">refraction</a> and double reflections (a weak reflection from the surface of the glass, and a stronger one from the reflecting metal) and reduces absorption of light by the mirror. Technical mirrors may use a silver, aluminium, or gold coating (the latter typically for <a class="uri" href="infrared" title="wikilink">infrared</a> mirrors), and achieve reflectivities of 90–95% when new. A protective transparent overcoat may be applied to prevent <a class="uri" href="oxidation" title="wikilink">oxidation</a> of the reflective layer. Applications requiring higher reflectivity or greater durability, where wide <a href="bandwidth_(signal_processing)" title="wikilink">bandwidth</a> is not essential, use <a href="dielectric_mirror" title="wikilink">dielectric coatings</a>, which can achieve reflectivities as high as 99.999% over a narrow range of wavelengths.</p>
<h2 id="types-of-glass-mirrors">Types of glass mirrors</h2>
<p> </p>
<p>There are many types of glass mirrors, each representing a different manufacturing process and reflection type.</p>
<p>An <strong>aluminium glass mirror</strong> is made of a <a href="float_glass" title="wikilink">float glass</a> manufactured using vacuum coating, i.e. aluminium powder is evaporated (or "sputtered") onto the exposed surface of the glass in a vacuum chamber and then coated with two or more layers of waterproof protective paint.</p>
<p>A <strong>low aluminium glass mirror</strong> is manufactured by coating silver and two layers of protective paint on the back surface of glass. A low aluminium glass mirror is very clear, light transmissive, smooth, and reflects accurate natural colors. This type of glass is widely used for framing presentations and exhibitions in which a precise color representation of the artwork is truly essential or when the background color of the frame is predominantly white.</p>
<p>A <strong>safety glass mirror</strong> is made by adhering a special protective film to the back surface of a silver glass mirror, which prevents injuries in case the mirror is broken. This kind of mirror is used for furniture, doors, glass walls, commercial shelves, or public areas.</p>
<p>A <strong>silkscreen printed glass mirror</strong> is produced using <a class="uri" href="inorganic" title="wikilink">inorganic</a> color ink that prints patterns through a special <a href="silkscreen" title="wikilink">screen</a> onto glass. Various colors, patterns, and glass shapes are available. Such a glass mirror is durable and more moisture resistant than ordinary printed glass and can serve for over 20 years. This type of glass is widely used for decorative purposes (e.g., on mirrors, table tops, doors, windows, kitchen <a href="Cutting_board" title="wikilink">chop boards</a>, etc.).</p>
<p>A <strong>silver glass mirror</strong> is an ordinary mirror, coated on its back surface with silver, which produces images by reflection. This kind of glass mirror is produced by coating a silver, copper film and two or more layers of waterproof paint on the back surface of float glass, which perfectly resists acid and moisture. A silver glass mirror provides clear and actual images, is quite durable, and is widely used for furniture, bathroom and other decorative purposes.</p>
<p>Decorative glass mirrors are usually handcrafted. A variety of shades, shapes and glass thickness are often available. </p>

<h3 id="shape-of-a-mirrors-surface">Shape of a mirror's surface</h3>
<p>A beam of light reflects off a mirror at an angle of reflection equal to its <a href="angle_of_incidence" title="wikilink">angle of incidence</a> (if the size of a mirror is much larger than the wavelength of light). That is, if the beam of light is shining on a mirror's surface, at a <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span>° angle vertically, then it reflects from the point of incidence at a <span class="LaTeX">$\theta$</span>° angle from vertically in the opposite direction. This law mathematically follows from the interference of a <a href="plane_wave" title="wikilink">plane wave</a> on a flat boundary (of much larger size than the wavelength).</p>
<ul>
<li>In a <strong>plane mirror</strong>, a <a href="parallel_(geometry)" title="wikilink">parallel</a> beam of light changes its direction as a whole, while still remaining parallel; the images formed by a plane mirror are <a href="virtual_image" title="wikilink">virtual images</a>, of the same size as the original object (see <a href="mirror_image" title="wikilink">mirror image</a>).</li>
<li>In a <strong><a href="concave_mirror" title="wikilink">concave mirror</a></strong>, parallel beams of light become a convergent beam, whose rays intersect in the <a href="Focus_(optics)" title="wikilink">focus</a> of the mirror. Also known as converging mirror</li>
<li>In a <strong><a href="convex_mirror" title="wikilink">convex mirror</a></strong>, parallel beams become divergent, with the <a href="ray_(optics)" title="wikilink">rays</a> appearing to diverge from a common point of intersection "behind" the mirror.</li>
<li><strong>Spherical concave and convex mirrors</strong> do not focus parallel rays to a single point due to <a href="spherical_aberration" title="wikilink">spherical aberration</a>. However, the ideal of focusing to a point is a commonly-used approximation. <strong><a href="Parabolic_reflector" title="wikilink">Parabolic reflectors</a></strong> resolve this, allowing incoming parallel rays (for example, light from a distant star) to be focused to a small spot; almost an ideal point. Parabolic reflectors are not suitable for imaging nearby objects because the light rays are not parallel.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mirror-image">Mirror image</h3>
<p>Objects viewed in a (plane) mirror will appear laterally inverted (e.g., if one raises one's right hand, the image's left hand will appear to go up in the mirror), but not vertically inverted (in the image a person's head still appears above his body). However, a mirror does not usually "swap" left and right any more than it swaps top and bottom. A mirror typically reverses the forward/backward axis. To be precise, it reverses the object in the direction perpendicular to the mirror surface (the normal). Because left and right are defined relative to front-back and top-bottom, the "flipping" of front and back results in the perception of a left-right reversal in the image. (If you stand side-on to a mirror, the mirror really does reverse your left and right, because that's the direction perpendicular to the mirror.)</p>
<p>Looking at an image of oneself with the front-back axis flipped results in the perception of an image with its left-right axis flipped. When reflected in the mirror, your right hand remains directly opposite your real right hand, but it is perceived as the left hand of your image. When a person looks into a mirror, the image is actually front-back reversed, which is an effect similar to the <a href="hollow-mask_illusion" title="wikilink">hollow-mask illusion</a>. Notice that a mirror image is fundamentally different from the object and cannot be reproduced by simply rotating the object.</p>
<p>For things that may be considered as two-dimensional objects (like text), front-back reversal cannot usually explain the observed reversal. In the same way that text on a piece of paper appears reversed if held up to a light and viewed from behind, text held facing a mirror will appear reversed, because the observer is behind the text. Another way to understand the reversals observed in images of objects that are effectively two-dimensional is that the inversion of left and right in a mirror is due to the way human beings turn their bodies. To turn from viewing the side of the object facing the mirror to view the reflection in the mirror requires the observer to look in the opposite direction. To look in another direction, human beings turn their heads about a vertical axis. This causes a left-right reversal in the image but not an up-down reversal. If a person instead turns by bending over and looking at the mirror image between his/her legs, up-down will appear reversed but not left-right. This sort of reversal is simply a change relative to the observer and not a change intrinsic to the image itself, as with a three-dimensional object.</p>

<dt>One-way mirrors</dt>
<dd>One-way mirrors (also called two-way mirrors) work by overwhelming dim transmitted light with bright reflected light. A true one-way mirror that actually allows light to be transmitted in one direction only without requiring external energy is not possible as it violates the <a href="second_law_of_thermodynamics" title="wikilink">second law of thermodynamics</a>: if one placed a cold object on the transmitting side and a hot one on the blocked side, radiant energy would be transferred from the cold to the hot object. Thus, though a one-way mirror can be made to appear to work in only one direction at a time, it is actually reflective from either side.

<h3 id="signaling">Signaling</h3>
<p>With the sun as light source, a mirror can be used to signal by variations in the orientation of the mirror.

This technique was used by <a href="Indigenous_peoples_of_the_Americas" title="wikilink">Native American</a> tribes and numerous <a href="military" title="wikilink">militaries</a> to transmit information between distant outposts.</p>
<p>Mirrors can also be used for search to attract the attention of <a href="search_and_rescue" title="wikilink">search and rescue</a> helicopters. Specialized signaling mirrors are available and are often included in military <a href="survival_kit" title="wikilink">survival kits</a>.</p>
<h3 id="technology">Technology</h3>
<h4 id="televisions-and-projectors">Televisions and projectors</h4>
<p>Microscopic mirrors are a core element of many of the largest <a href="HDTV" title="wikilink">high-definition</a> televisions and <a href="video_projector" title="wikilink">video projectors</a>. A common technology of this type is <a href="Texas_Instruments" title="wikilink">Texas Instruments</a>' <a href="digital_light_processing" title="wikilink">DLP</a>. A DLP chip is a postage stamp-sized microchip whose surface is an array of millions of microscopic mirrors. The picture is created as the individual mirrors move to either reflect light toward the projection surface (<a class="uri" href="pixel" title="wikilink">pixel</a> on), or toward a light absorbing surface (pixel off).</p>
<p>Other projection technologies involving mirrors include <a class="uri" href="LCoS" title="wikilink">LCoS</a>. Like a DLP chip, LCoS is a microchip of similar size, but rather than millions of individual mirrors, there is a single mirror that is actively shielded by a <a href="liquid_crystal" title="wikilink">liquid crystal</a> matrix with up to millions of <a class="uri" href="pixels" title="wikilink">pixels</a>. The picture, formed as light, is either reflected toward the projection surface (pixel on), or absorbed by the activated <a class="uri" href="LCD" title="wikilink">LCD</a> pixels (pixel off). LCoS-based televisions and projectors often use 3 chips, one for each primary color.</p>
<p>Large mirrors are used in rear projection televisions. Light (for example from a DLP as mentioned above) is "folded" by one or more mirrors so that the television set is compact.</p>

<p><a href="Telescope" title="wikilink">Telescopes</a> and other precision instruments use <em>front silvered</em> or <a href="first_surface_mirrors" title="wikilink">first surface mirrors</a>, where the reflecting surface is placed on the front (or first) surface of the glass (this eliminates reflection from glass surface ordinary back mirrors have). Some of them use silver, but most are aluminium, which is more reflective at short wavelengths than silver. All of these coatings are easily damaged and require special handling. They reflect 90% to 95% of the incident light when new. The coatings are typically applied by <a href="vacuum_deposition" title="wikilink">vacuum deposition</a>. A protective overcoat is usually applied before the mirror is removed from the vacuum, because the coating otherwise begins to corrode as soon as it is exposed to oxygen and humidity in the air. <em>Front silvered</em> mirrors have to be resurfaced occasionally to keep their quality. There are optical mirrors such as <a href="mangin_mirror" title="wikilink">mangin mirrors</a> that are <em>second surface mirrors</em> (reflective coating on the rear surface) as part of their optical designs, usually to correct <a href="optical_aberration" title="wikilink">optical aberrations</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

</figure>
<p>The reflectivity of the mirror coating can be measured using a <a href="Spectrophotometer" title="wikilink">reflectometer</a> and for a particular metal it will be different for different wavelengths of light. This is exploited in some <a class="uri" href="optical" title="wikilink">optical</a> work to make <a href="cold_mirror" title="wikilink">cold mirrors</a> and <a href="hot_mirror" title="wikilink">hot mirrors</a>. A cold mirror is made by using a transparent substrate and choosing a coating material that is more reflective to visible light and more transmissive to <a class="uri" href="infrared" title="wikilink">infrared</a> light.</p>
<p>A hot mirror is the opposite, the coating preferentially reflects infrared. Mirror surfaces are sometimes given thin film overcoatings both to retard degradation of the surface and to increase their reflectivity in parts of the spectrum where they will be used. For instance, aluminum mirrors are commonly coated with silicon dioxide or magnesium fluoride. The reflectivity as a function of wavelength depends on both the thickness of the coating and on how it is applied.</p>
<p>  For scientific <a href="optics" title="wikilink">optical</a> work, <a href="dielectric_mirror" title="wikilink">dielectric mirrors</a> are often used. These are glass (or sometimes other material) substrates on which one or more layers of dielectric material are deposited, to form an optical coating. By careful choice of the type and thickness of the dielectric layers, the range of wavelengths and amount of light reflected from the mirror can be specified. The best mirrors of this type can reflect >99.999% of the light (in a narrow range of wavelengths) which is incident on the mirror. Such mirrors are often used in <a href="laser" title="wikilink">lasers</a>.</p>
<p>In astronomy, <a href="adaptive_optics" title="wikilink">adaptive optics</a> is a technique to measure variable image distortions and adapt a <a href="deformable_mirror" title="wikilink">deformable mirror</a> accordingly on a timescale of milliseconds, to compensate for the distortions.</p>
<p>Although most mirrors are designed to reflect visible light, surfaces reflecting other forms of electromagnetic radiation are also called "mirrors". The mirrors for other ranges of <a href="electromagnetic_waves" title="wikilink">electromagnetic waves</a> are used in optics and <a class="uri" href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomy</a>.

<p>Two or more mirrors aligned exactly parallel and facing each other can give an <a href="infinite_regress" title="wikilink">infinite regress</a> of reflections, called an <a href="infinity_mirror" title="wikilink">infinity mirror</a> effect.

<h4 id="military-applications">Military applications</h4>
<p>It has been said that <a class="uri" href="Archimedes" title="wikilink">Archimedes</a> used a large array of mirrors to burn <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Roman</a> ships during an attack on Syracuse. This has never been proven or disproved; however, it has been put to the test. Recently, on a popular <a href="Discovery_Channel" title="wikilink">Discovery Channel</a> show, <em><a class="uri" href="MythBusters" title="wikilink">MythBusters</a></em>, a team from <a class="uri" href="MIT" title="wikilink">MIT</a> tried to recreate the famous "Archimedes Death Ray". They were <a href="http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www//experiments/deathray/10_Mythbusters.html">unsuccessful</a> at starting a fire on the ship. Previous attempts to light the boat on fire using only the bronze mirrors available in Archimedes' time were unsuccessful, and the time taken to ignite the craft would have made its use impractical, resulting in the MythBusters team deeming the myth "busted". It was however found that the mirrors made it very difficult for the passengers of the targeted boat to see, likely helping to cause their defeat, which may have been the origin of the myth. (See <a href="solar_power_tower" title="wikilink">solar power tower</a> for a practical use of this technique.)</p>

<h3 id="architecture">Architecture</h3>
<p>  Mirrors are a popular design theme in architecture, particularly with <a href="Modern_architecture" title="wikilink">late modern</a> and <a href="Post-modern_architecture" title="wikilink">post-modernist</a> high-rise buildings in major cities. Early examples include the Campbell Center in <a class="uri" href="Dallas" title="wikilink">Dallas</a>, which opened in 1972,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and the <a href="John_Hancock_Tower" title="wikilink">John Hancock Tower</a> in Boston.</p>
<p>More recently, two skyscrapers designed by architect <a href="Rafael_Viñoly" title="wikilink">Rafael Viñoly</a>, the <a class="uri" href="Vdara" title="wikilink">Vdara</a> in Las Vegas and <a href="20_Fenchurch_Street" title="wikilink">20 Fenchurch Street</a> in London, have experienced unusual problems due to their concave curved glass exteriors acting as respectively cylindrical and spherical reflectors for sunlight. In 2010, the Las Vegas Review Journal reported that sunlight reflected off the Vdara's south-facing tower could singe swimmers in the hotel pool, as well as melting plastic cups and shopping bags; employees of the hotel referred to the phenomenon as the "Vdara death ray",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> aka the "<a class="uri" href="fryscraper" title="wikilink">fryscraper</a>."

<h4 id="paintings">Paintings</h4>
<p> Painters depicting someone gazing into a mirror often also show the person's reflection. This is a kind of abstraction—in most cases the angle of view is such that the person's reflection should not be visible. Similarly, in movies and <a href="Photography" title="wikilink">still photography</a> an actor or actress is often shown ostensibly looking at him- or herself in the mirror, and yet the reflection faces the camera. In reality, the actor or actress sees only the camera and its operator in this case, not their own reflection.</p>
<p>The mirror is the central device in some of the greatest of European paintings:</p>

<li><a href="Leonardo_da_Vinci" title="wikilink">Leonardo da Vinci</a> called the mirror the "master of painters". He recommended, "When you wish to see whether your whole picture accords with what you have portrayed from nature take a mirror and reflect the actual object in it. Compare what is reflected with your painting and carefully consider whether both likenesses of the subject correspond, particularly in regard to the mirror."</li>
<li>Many <a class="uri" href="self-portraits" title="wikilink">self-portraits</a> are made possible through the use of mirrors:

<ul>
<li>Mirrors, typically large and unframed, are frequently used in <a href="interior_decoration" title="wikilink">interior decoration</a> to create an illusion of space and amplify the apparent size of a room.
