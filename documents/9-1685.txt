   Clock angle problem      Clock angle problem    Clock angle problems are a type of mathematical problem which involve finding the angles between the hands of an analog clock .  Math problem  Clock angle problems relate two different measurements: angles and time . The angle is typically measured in degrees from the mark of number 12 clockwise. The time is usually based on 12-hour clock .  A method to solve such problems is to consider the rate of change of the angle in degrees per minute. The hour hand of a normal 12-hour analogue clock turns 360° in 12 hours (720 minutes) or 0.5° per minute. The minute hand rotates through 360° in 60 minutes or 6° per minute. 1  Equation for the angle of the hour hand       θ  hr   =    1  2    M  Σ    =    1  2    (    60  H   +  M   )           subscript  θ  hr       1  2    subscript  M  normal-Σ             1  2       60  H   M       \theta_{\text{hr}}=\frac{1}{2}M_{\Sigma}=\frac{1}{2}(60H+M)     where:      θ   θ   \scriptstyle\theta   is the angle in degrees of the hand measured clockwise from the 12     H   H   \scriptstyle H   is the hour.     M   M   \scriptstyle M   is the minutes past the hour.      M  Σ     subscript  M  normal-Σ    \scriptstyle M_{\Sigma}   is the minutes past 12 o'clock.   Equation for the angle of the minute hand       θ  min.   =   6  M        subscript  θ  min.     6  M     \theta_{\text{min.}}=6M     where:      θ   θ   \scriptstyle\theta   is the angle in degrees of the hand measured clockwise from the 12 o'clock position.     M   M   \scriptstyle M   is the minute.   Example  The time is 5:24. The angle in degrees of the hour hand is:       θ  hr   =    1  2    (    60  ×  5   +  24   )    =  162         subscript  θ  hr       1  2       60  5   24         162     \theta_{\text{hr}}=\frac{1}{2}(60\times 5+24)=162     The angle in degrees of the minute hand is:       θ  min.   =   6  ×  24   =  144         subscript  θ  min.     6  24        144     \theta_{\text{min.}}=6\times 24=144     Equation for the angle between the hands  The angle between the hands can be found using the following formula:      Δ  θ      normal-Δ  θ    \displaystyle\Delta\theta     where      H   H   \scriptstyle H   is the hour     M   M   \scriptstyle M   is the minute   Example  The time is 2:20.      Δ  θ      normal-Δ  θ    \displaystyle\Delta\theta     When are the hour and minute hands of a clock superimposed?  The hour and minute hands are superimposed only when their angle is the same.      θ  hr     subscript  θ  hr    \displaystyle\theta_{\text{hr}}      H   H   \scriptstyle H   is an integer in the range 0–11. This gives times of: 0:00, 1:05.    45  ¯     normal-¯  45    \overline{45}   , 2:10.    90  ¯     normal-¯  90    \overline{90}   , 3:16.    36  ¯     normal-¯  36    \overline{36}   , etc. (0.    45  ¯     normal-¯  45    \overline{45}   minutes are exactly 27.    27  ¯     normal-¯  27    \overline{27}   seconds.)
