   Stress–strain index      Stress–strain index   The stress – strain index (SSI), of a bone , is a surrogate measure of bone strength 1 determined from a cross-sectional scan by QCT or pQCT ( radiological scan ). The stress–strain index is used to compare the structural parameters determined by analysis of QCT/pQCT cross-sectional scans to the results of three point bending test .  Definition  It is calculated using the following formula: 2      S  S  I   =    ∑   i  =  0   n      r  i  2   a   (    C  D    N  D    )     r   m  a  x            S  S  I     superscript   subscript     i  0    n        superscript   subscript  r  i   2   a      C  D     N  D      subscript  r    m  a  x        SSI=\sum_{i=0}^{n}{{r_{i}^{2}a({{CD}\over{ND}})}\over{r_{max}}}     Where:   r max is the distance of voxel from centre  CD is the apparent cortical (bone)  density  ND is the normal (cortical bone) density  r i is the pixel position from the centre  a is the area of a pixel   History and relation to moments of inertia  It was developed by the manufacturer of a peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT) scanner, 3 and is considered to be by some an improvement over the information provided by calculating the area moments of inertia and polar moments of inertia .
