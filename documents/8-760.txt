Stress–strain index




Stress–strain index

The stress–strain index (SSI), of a bone, is a surrogate measure of bone strength1 determined from a cross-sectional scan by QCT or pQCT (radiological scan). The stress–strain index is used to compare the structural parameters determined by analysis of QCT/pQCT cross-sectional scans to the results of three point bending test.
Definition
It is calculated using the following formula:2


Where:

rmax is the distance of voxel from centre
CD is the apparent cortical (bone) density
ND is the normal (cortical bone) density
ri is the pixel position from the centre
a is the area of a pixel

History and relation to moments of inertia
It was developed by the manufacturer of a peripheral quantitative CT (pQCT) scanner,3 and is considered to be by some an improvement over the information provided by calculating the area moments of inertia and polar moments of inertia.
