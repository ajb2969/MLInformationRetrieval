   Paper bag problem      Paper bag problem   In geometry , the paper bag problem or teabag problem is to calculate the maximum possible inflated volume of an initially flat sealed rectangular bag which has the same shape as a cushion or pillow , made out of two pieces of material which can bend but not stretch.  (Figure)  A cushion filled with stuffing   (Figure)  A numerical simulation of an inflated teabag (with crimping smoothed out)   According to Anthony C. Robin , an approximate formula for the capacity of a sealed expanded bag is:      V  =   w  3    (  h  /   (  π  w  )   -  0.142   (  1  -   10  (   -  h  /  w  )   )   )  ,     fragments  V    superscript  w  3    fragments  normal-(  h    fragments  normal-(  π  w  normal-)    0.142   fragments  normal-(  1    superscript  10  normal-(    h   w  normal-)   normal-)   normal-)  normal-,    V=w^{3}\left(h/\left(\pi w\right)-0.142\left(1-10^{\left(}-h/w\right)\right)%
 \right),     where w is the width of the bag (the shorter dimension), h is the height (the longer dimension), and V is the maximum volume. The approximation ignores the crimping round the equator of the bag.  A very rough approximation to the capacity of a bag that is open at one edge is:      V  =   w  3    (  h  /   (  π  w  )   -  0.071   (  1  -   10  (   -  2  h  /  w  )   )   )     fragments  V    superscript  w  3    fragments  normal-(  h    fragments  normal-(  π  w  normal-)    0.071   fragments  normal-(  1    superscript  10  normal-(    2  h   w  normal-)   normal-)   normal-)    V=w^{3}\left(h/\left(\pi w\right)-0.071\left(1-10^{\left(}-2h/w\right)\right)\right)     (This latter formula assumes that the corners at the bottom of the bag are linked by a single edge, and that the base of the bag is not a more complex shape such as a lens ).  The square teabag  In the special case where the bag is sealed on all edges and is square with unit sides, h = w = 1, and so the first formula estimates a volume for this of roughly:      V  =    1  π   -   0.142  ⋅  0.9        V      1  π    normal-⋅  0.142  0.9      V=\frac{1}{\pi}-0.142\cdot 0.9     or roughly 0.19. According to Andrew Kepert at the University of Newcastle, Australia , an upper bound for this version of the teabag problem is 0.217+, and he has made a construction that appears to give a volume of 0.2055+.  In the article referred to above A C Robin also found a more complicated formula for the general paper bag. Whilst this is beyond the scope of a general work, it is of interest to note that for the tea bag case this formula gives 0.2017, unfortunately not within the bounds given by Kepert (i.e., 0.2055+ ≤ maximum volume ≤ 0.217+).
