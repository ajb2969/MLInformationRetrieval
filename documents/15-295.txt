   Zinbiel algebra      Zinbiel algebra   In mathematics , a Zinbiel algebra or dual Leibniz algebra is a module over a commutative ring with a bilinear product satisfying the defining identity:         (   a  ∘  b   )   ∘  c   =    a  ∘   (   b  ∘  c   )    +   a  ∘   (   c  ∘  b   )      .          a  b   c       a    b  c      a    c  b       (a\circ b)\circ c=a\circ(b\circ c)+a\circ(c\circ b).     Zinbiel algebras were introduced by . The name was proposed by J.-M. Lemaire as being "opposite" to Leibniz algebra. 1  The symmetrised product       a  ⋆  b   =    a  ∘  b   +   b  ∘  a         normal-⋆  a  b       a  b     b  a      a\star b=a\circ b+b\circ a     is associative.  A Zinbiel algebra is the Koszul dual concept to a Leibniz algebra . The free Zinbiel algebra over V is the tensor algebra with product         (    x  0   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   x  p    )   ∘   (    x   p  +  1    ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   x   p  +  q     )    =    x  0     ∑   (  p  ,  q  )     (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x   p  +  q    )      ,         tensor-product   subscript  x  0   normal-⋯   subscript  x  p     tensor-product   subscript  x    p  1    normal-⋯   subscript  x    p  q         subscript  x  0     subscript    p  q      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x    p  q         (x_{0}\otimes\cdots\otimes x_{p})\circ(x_{p+1}\otimes\cdots\otimes x_{p+q})=x_%
