Zinbiel algebras were introduced by . The name was proposed by J.-M. Lemaire as being "opposite" to Leibniz algebra.1
The symmetrised product



is associative.
A Zinbiel algebra is the Koszul dual concept to a Leibniz algebra. The free Zinbiel algebra over V is the tensor algebra with product



where the sum is over all (p,q) shuffles.2
