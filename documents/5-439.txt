   Mixed anomaly      Mixed anomaly   In theoretical physics , a mixed anomaly is an example of an anomaly : it is an effect of quantum mechanics — usually a one-loop diagram — that implies that the classically valid general covariance and gauge symmetry of a theory of general relativity combined with gauge fields and fermionic fields cannot be preserved simultaneously in the quantum theory.  The adjective "mixed" usually refers to a mixture of a gravitational anomaly and gauge anomaly .  The anomaly usually appears as a Feynman diagram with a chiral  fermion running in the loop (a polygon) with n−k external gravitons and k external gauge bosons attached to the loop where    n  =   1  +   D  /  2        n    1    D  2      n=1+D/2   where   D   D   D   is the spacetime dimension. Anomalies occur only in even spacetime dimensions. For example, the anomalies in the usual 4 spacetime dimensions arise from triangle Feynman diagrams.
