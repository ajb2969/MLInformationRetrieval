   Ectoine synthase      Ectoine synthase   In enzymology , an ectoine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N 4 -acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-ectoine + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , N4-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutanoate , and two products , L-ectoine and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N4-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutanoate hydro-lyase (L-ectoine-forming) . Other names in common use include N-acetyldiaminobutyrate dehydratase , N-acetyldiaminobutanoate dehydratase , L-ectoine synthase , EctC , and 4-N-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutanoate hydro-lyase (L-ectoine-forming) . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism .  References        "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
