Ectoine synthase

In enzymology, an ectoine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N4-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutanoate 
 
 
 
  L-ectoine + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, N4-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutanoate, and two products, L-ectoine and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N4-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutanoate hydro-lyase (L-ectoine-forming). Other names in common use include N-acetyldiaminobutyrate dehydratase, N-acetyldiaminobutanoate dehydratase, L-ectoine synthase, EctC, and 4-N-acetyl-L-2,4-diaminobutanoate hydro-lyase (L-ectoine-forming). This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism.
