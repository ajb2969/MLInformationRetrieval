   Gauge gravitation theory      Gauge gravitation theory   In quantum field theory , gauge gravitation theory is the effort to extend Yang–Mills theory , which provides a universal description of the fundamental interactions, to describe gravity . It should not be confused with the related but distinct gauge theory gravity .  The first gauge model of gravity was suggested by R. Utiyama in 1956 1 just two years after birth of the gauge theory itself. 2 However, the initial attempts to construct the gauge theory of gravity by analogy with the gauge models of internal symmetries encountered a problem of treating general covariant transformations and establishing the gauge status of a pseudo-Riemannian metric (a tetrad field).  In order to overcome this drawback, representing tetrad fields as gauge fields of the translation group was attempted. 3 Infinitesimal generators of general covariant transformations were considered as those of the translation gauge group, and a tetrad (coframe) field was identified with the translation part of an affine connection on a world manifold    X   X   X   . Any such connection is a sum    K  =   Γ  +  Θ       K    normal-Γ  normal-Θ     K=\Gamma+\Theta   of a linear world connection    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   and a soldering form    Θ  =     Θ  μ  a   d   x  μ    ⊗   ϑ  a        normal-Θ   tensor-product     superscript   subscript  normal-Θ  μ   a   d   superscript  x  μ     subscript  ϑ  a      \Theta=\Theta_{\mu}^{a}dx^{\mu}\otimes\vartheta_{a}   where     ϑ  a   =    ϑ  a  λ    ∂  λ         subscript  ϑ  a      superscript   subscript  ϑ  a   λ    subscript   λ      \vartheta_{a}=\vartheta_{a}^{\lambda}\partial_{\lambda}   is a non-holonomic frame. For instance, if   K   K   K   is the Cartan connection, then    Θ  =  θ  =    d   x  μ    ⊗   ∂  μ          normal-Θ  θ        tensor-product    d   superscript  x  μ     subscript   μ       \Theta=\theta=dx^{\mu}\otimes\partial_{\mu}   is the canonical soldering form on   X   X   X   . There are different physical interpretations of the translation part   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   of affine connections . In gauge theory of dislocations, a field   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   describes a distortion. 4 At the same time, given a linear frame    ϑ  a     subscript  ϑ  a    \vartheta_{a}   , the decomposition    θ  =    ϑ  a   ⊗   ϑ  a        θ   tensor-product   superscript  ϑ  a    subscript  ϑ  a      \theta=\vartheta^{a}\otimes\vartheta_{a}   motivates many authors to treat a coframe    ϑ  a     superscript  ϑ  a    \vartheta^{a}   as a translation gauge field. 5  Difficulties of constructing gauge gravitation theory by analogy with the Yang-Mills one result from the gauge transformations in these theories belonging to different classes. In the case of internal symmetries, the gauge transformations are just vertical automorphisms of a principal bundle     P  →  X     normal-→  P  X    P\to X   leaving its base   X   X   X   fixed. On the other hand, gravitation theory is built on the principal bundle    F  X      F  X    FX   of the tangent frames to   X   X   X   . It belongs to the category of natural bundles     T  →  X     normal-→  T  X    T\to X   for which diffeomorphisms of the base   X   X   X   canonically give rise to automorphisms of   T   T   T   . 6 These automorphisms are called general covariant transformations. General covariant transformations are sufficient in order to restate Einstein's General Relativity and metric-affine gravitation theory as the gauge ones.  In terms of gauge theory on natural bundles, gauge fields are linear connections on a world manifold   X   X   X   , defined as principal connections on the linear frame bundle     F  X      F  X    FX   , and a metric (tetrad) gravitational field plays the role of a Higgs field responsible for spontaneous symmetry breaking of general covariant transformations. 7  Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a quantum effect when the vacuum is not invariant under the transformation group. In classical gauge theory , spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs if the structure group    G   G   G   of a principal bundle     P  →  X     normal-→  P  X    P\to X   is reducible to a closed subgroup   H   H   H   , i.e., there exists a principal subbundle of   P   P   P   with the structure group    H   H   H   . 8 By virtue of the well-known theorem, there exists one-to-one correspondence between the reduced principal subbundles of   P   P   P   with the structure group   H   H   H   and the global sections of the quotient bundle     P  /  H   →  X     normal-→    P  H   X    P/H\to X   . These sections are treated as classical Higgs fields.  The idea of the pseudo-Riemannian metric as a Higgs field appeared while constructing non-linear (induced) representations of the general linear group    G  L   (  4  ,  ℝ  )       G  L   4  ℝ     GL(4,\mathbb{R})   , of which the Lorentz group is a Cartan subgroup. 9 The geometric equivalence principle postulating the existence of a reference frame in which Lorentz invariants are defined on the whole world manifold is the theoretical justification of that the structure group     G  L   (  4  ,  ℝ  )       G  L   4  ℝ     GL(4,\mathbb{R})   of the linear frame bundle    F  X      F  X    FX   is reduced to the Lorentz group . Then the very definition of a pseudo-Riemannian metric on a manifold   X   X   X   as a global section of the quotient bundle       F  X   /  O    (  1  ,  3  )    →  X     normal-→        F  X   O    1  3    X    FX/O(1,3)\to X   leads to its physical interpretation as a Higgs field . The physical reason for world symmetry breaking is the existence of Dirac fermion matter, whose symmetry group is the universal two-sheeted covering    S  L   (  2  ,  ℂ  )       S  L   2  ℂ     SL(2,\mathbb{C})   of the restricted Lorentz group ,    S   O  +    (  1  ,  3  )       S   superscript  O     1  3     SO^{+}(1,3)   . 10  See also  Notes  References   I.
