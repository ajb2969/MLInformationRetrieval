D-dopachrome decarboxylase

In enzymology, a D-dopachrome decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-dopachrome 
 
 
 
  5,6-dihydroxyindole + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-dopachrome, and two products, 5,6-dihydroxyindole and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-dopachrome carboxy-lyase (5,6-dihydroxyindole-forming). Other names in common use include phenylpyruvate tautomerase II, D-tautomerase, D-dopachrome tautomerase, and D-dopachrome carboxy-lyase.
