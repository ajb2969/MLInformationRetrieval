   Zodi      Zodi   The zodi is a unit of zodiacal dust . 1 One zodi is the amount of interplanetary dust in the inner solar system . 2 This dust absorbs light from the Sun and re-radiates it as thermal radiation. The luminosity of the zodiacal dust in the Solar System is about    10   -  7      superscript  10    7     10^{-7}   relative to the luminosity of the Sun, 3 in The Astrophysical Journal, 713, p. 816 and in practice, this is the observable characteristic defining one zodi.
