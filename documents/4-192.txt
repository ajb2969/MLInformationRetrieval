Exact trigonometric constants

  Exact algebraic expressions for trigonometric values are sometimes useful, mainly for simplifying solutions into radical forms which allow further simplification.
All values of the sines, cosines, and tangents of angles at 3° increments are derivable in radicals using identities—the half-angle identity, the double-angle identity, and the angle addition/subtraction identity—and using values for 0°, 30°, 36°, and 45°. Note that 1° = 
 
 
 
 /180 radians.
According to Niven's theorem, the only rational values of the sine function for which the argument is a rational number of degrees are 0, 1/2,  1, −1/2, and −1.
Fermat number
The list in this article is incomplete in at least two senses. First, it is always possible to apply the half-angle formula to find an exact expression for the cosine of one-half of any angle on the list, then half of that angle, etc. Second, this article exploits only the first two of five known Fermat primes: 3 and 5, whereas algebraic expressions also exist for the functions of 2
 
 
 
 /17, 2
 
 
 
 /257, and 2
 
 
 
 
 /65537. In practice, all values of sines, cosines, and tangents not found in this article are approximated using the techniques described at Generating trigonometric tables.
Table of constants
Values outside the [0°, 45°] angle range are trivially derived from these values, using circle axis reflection symmetry. (See Trigonometric identity.)
In the entries below, when a certain number of degrees is related to a regular polygon, the relation is that the number of degrees in each angle of the polygon is (n – 2) times the indicated number of degrees (where n is the number of sides). This is because the sum of the angles of any n-gon is 180°×(n – 2) and so the measure of each angle of any regular n-gon is 180°×(n – 2) ÷ n. Thus for example the entry "45°: square" means that, with n = 4, 180° ÷ n = 45°, and the number of degrees in each angle of a square is (n – 2)×45° = 90°.

Uses for constants
As an example of the use of these constants, consider a dodecahedron with the following volume, where a is the length of an edge:

Derivation triangles
(Figure)
Regular polygon (N-sided) and its fundamental right triangle. Angles: a = 180/n° and b =90(1 − 2/n)°

The derivation of sine, cosine, and tangent constants into radial forms is based upon the constructibility of right triangles.
Here right triangles made from symmetry sections of regular polygons are used to calculate fundamental trigonometric ratios. Each right triangle represents three points in a regular polygon: a vertex, an edge center containing that vertex, and the polygon center. An n-gon can be divided into 2n right triangles with angles of {180/n, 90 − 180/n, 90} degrees, for n in 3, 4, 5, ...
Constructibility of 3, 4, 5, and 15-sided polygons are the basis, and angle bisectors allow multiples of two to also be derived.

 , i.e., the reciprocal of the golden ratio, from Ptolemy's theorem 

Geometrical method
Applying Ptolemy's theorem to the cyclic quadrilateral ABCD defined by four successive vertices of the pentagon, we can find that:



which is the reciprocal 1/φ of the golden ratio. crd is the chord function,



(See also Ptolemy's table of chords.)
Thus



(Alternatively, without using Ptolemy's theorem, label as X the intersection of AC and BD, and note by considering angles that triangle AXB is isosceles, so AX = AB = a. Triangles AXD and CXB are similar, because AD is parallel to BC. So XC = a·(a/b). But AX + XC = AC, so a + a2/b = b. Solving this gives a/b = 1/φ, as above).

6° is 36 − 30, 12° is 30 − 18, 24° is 54 − 30, and 42° is 60 − 18; so we use the subtraction formulas for sine and cosine.

 /60

3° is 18 − 15, 21° is 36 − 15, 33° is 18 + 15, and 39° is 54 − 15, so we use the subtraction (or addition) formulas for sine and cosine.
 

Strategies for simplifying expressions
Rationalize the denominator

If the denominator is a square root, multiply the numerator and denominator by that radical.
 
If the denominator is the sum or difference of two terms, multiply the numerator and denominator by the conjugate of the denominator. The conjugate is the identical, except the sign between the terms is changed.
 
Sometimes you need to rationalize the denominator more than once.
 

Split a fraction in two

Sometimes it helps to split the fraction into the sum of two fractions and then simplify both separately.
 

Squaring and square rooting

If there is a complicated term, with only one kind of radical in a term, this plan may help. Square the term, combine like terms, and take the square root. This may leave a big radical with a smaller radical inside, but it is often better than the original.
 

Simplification of nested radical expressions
In general nested radicals cannot be reduced.
But if for 
 
 
 
 ,



is rational, and both



are rational, then
