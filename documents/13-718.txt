   Exponential map (discrete dynamical systems)      Exponential map (discrete dynamical systems)   In the theory of dynamical systems , the exponential map can be used as the evolution function of the discrete nonlinear dynamical system . 1  Family  The family of exponential functions is called exponential family .  Forms  There are many forms of these maps, 2 many of which are equivalent under a coordinate transformation. For example two of the most common ones are:        E  c   :   z  →    e  z   +   c        normal-:   subscript  E  c    normal-→  z     superscript  e  z   c      E_{c}:z\to e^{z}+c\,          E  λ   :   z  →   λ  *   e  z        normal-:   subscript  E  λ    normal-→  z    λ   superscript  e  z       E_{\lambda}:z\to\lambda*e^{z}      The second one can be mapped to the first using the fact that    λ  *   e  z   .  =   e   z  +   l  n   (  λ  )         fragments  λ    superscript  e  z   normal-.    superscript  e    z    l  n  λ       \lambda*e^{z}.=e^{z+ln(\lambda)}   , so     E  λ   :   z  →    e  z   +   l  n   (  λ  )         normal-:   subscript  E  λ    normal-→  z     superscript  e  z     l  n  λ       E_{\lambda}:z\to e^{z}+ln(\lambda)   is the same under the transformation    z  =   z  +   l  n   (  λ  )         z    z    l  n  λ      z=z+ln(\lambda)   . The only difference is that, due to multi-valued properties of exponentiation, there may be a few select cases that can only be found in one version. Similar arguments can be made for many other formulas.
