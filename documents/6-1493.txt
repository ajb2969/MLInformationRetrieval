   Roy's identity      Roy's identity   Roy's identity (named for French  economist  René Roy ) is a major result in microeconomics having applications in consumer choice and the theory of the firm . The lemma relates the ordinary (Marshallian) demand function to the derivatives of the indirect utility function . Specifically, where    V   (  P  ,  Y  )       V   P  Y     V(P,Y)   is the indirect utility function, then the Marshallian demand function for good   i   i   i   can be calculated as:       x  i  m   =   -     ∂  V    ∂   p  i       ∂  V    ∂  Y           superscript   subscript  x  i   m           V      subscript  p  i         V     Y        x_{i}^{m}=-\frac{\frac{\partial V}{\partial p_{i}}}{\frac{\partial V}{\partial
 Y}}     where   P   P   P   is the price vector of goods and   Y   Y   Y   is income.  Derivation of Roy's identity  Roy's identity reformulates Shephard's lemma in order to get a Marshallian demand function for an individual and a good (   i   i   i   ) from some indirect utility function.  The first step is to consider the trivial identity obtained by substituting the expenditure function for wealth or income    Y   Y   Y   in the indirect utility function     V   (  P  ,  Y  )       V   P  Y     V(P,Y)   , at a utility of   u   u   u   :       V   (  P  ,   e   (  P  ,  u  )    )    =  u        V   P    e   P  u      u    V(P,e(P,u))=u     This says that the indirect utility function evaluated in such a way that minimizes the cost for achieving a certain utility given a set of prices (a vector   p   p   p   ) is equal to that utility when evaluated at those prices.  Taking the derivative of both sides of this equation with respect to the price of a single good    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   (with the utility level held constant) gives:           ∂  V    [  P  ,   e   (  P  ,  u  )    ]     ∂  Y       ∂  e    (  P  ,  u  )     ∂   p  i      +     ∂  V    [  P  ,   e   (  P  ,  u  )    ]     ∂   p  i      =  0                V    P    e   P  u        Y          e    P  u       subscript  p  i            V    P    e   P  u         subscript  p  i      0    \frac{\partial V[P,e(P,u)]}{\partial Y}\frac{\partial e(P,u)}{\partial p_{i}}+%
 \frac{\partial V[P,e(P,u)]}{\partial p_{i}}=0   .  Rearranging gives the desired result:       -      ∂  V    [  P  ,   e   (  P  ,  u  )    ]     ∂   p  i        ∂  V    [  P  ,   e   (  P  ,  u  )    ]     ∂  Y      =     ∂  e    (  P  ,  u  )     ∂   p  i     =    h  i    (  P  ,  u  )    =    x  i    (  P  ,   e   (  P  ,  u  )    )                    V    P    e   P  u         subscript  p  i           V    P    e   P  u        Y            e    P  u       subscript  p  i             subscript  h  i    P  u            subscript  x  i    P    e   P  u         -\frac{\frac{\partial V[P,e(P,u)]}{\partial p_{i}}}{\frac{\partial V[P,e(P,u)]%
 }{\partial Y}}=\frac{\partial e(P,u)}{\partial p_{i}}=h_{i}(P,u)=x_{i}(P,e(P,u))     with the second-to-last equality following from Shephard's lemma and the last equality from a basic property of Hicksian demand .  Alternative proof for the differentiable case  There is a simpler proof of Roy's identity, stated for the two-good case for simplicity.  The indirect utility function    V   (   p  1   ,   p  2   ,  Y  )       V    subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   Y     V(p_{1},p_{2},Y)   is the maximand of the constrained optimization problem characterized by the following Lagrangian:      ℒ  =    U   (   x  1   ,   x  2   )    +   λ   (   Y  -    p  1    x  1    -    p  2    x  2     )         ℒ      U    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2       λ    Y     subscript  p  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  p  2    subscript  x  2         \mathcal{L}=U(x_{1},x_{2})+\lambda(Y-p_{1}x_{1}-p_{2}x_{2})     By the envelope theorem , the derivatives of the maximand    V   (   p  1   ,   p  2   ,  Y  )       V    subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2   Y     V(p_{1},p_{2},Y)   with respect to the parameters can be computed as such:        ∂  V    ∂   p  1     =   -   λ   x  1  m             V      subscript  p  1         λ   superscript   subscript  x  1   m       \frac{\partial V}{\partial p_{1}}=-\lambda x_{1}^{m}           ∂  V    ∂  Y    =  λ          V     Y    λ    \frac{\partial V}{\partial Y}=\lambda     where    x  1  m     superscript   subscript  x  1   m    x_{1}^{m}   is the maximizer (i.e. the Marshallian demand function for good 1). Simple arithmetic then gives Roy's Identity:       -     ∂  V    ∂   p  1       ∂  V    ∂  Y      =   -    -   λ   x  1  m     λ    =   x  1  m                 V      subscript  p  1         V     Y              λ   superscript   subscript  x  1   m     λ          superscript   subscript  x  1   m      -\frac{\frac{\partial V}{\partial p_{1}}}{\frac{\partial V}{\partial Y}}=-%
 \frac{-\lambda x_{1}^{m}}{\lambda}=x_{1}^{m}     Application  This gives a method of deriving the Marshallian demand function of a good for some consumer from the indirect utility function of that consumer. It is also fundamental in deriving the Slutsky equation .  References     "  Category:Microeconomics  Category:Underlying principles of microeconomic behavior  Category:Consumer theory
