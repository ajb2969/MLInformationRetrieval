   Diagonal form      Diagonal form   In mathematics , a diagonal form is an algebraic form ( homogeneous polynomial ) without cross-terms involving different indeterminates . That is, it is      Σ   a  i    x  i    m       normal-Σ   subscript  a  i    superscript   subscript  x  i   m     \Sigma a_{i}{x_{i}}^{m}     for some given degree m , summed for 1 ≤ i ≤ n .  Such forms F , and the hypersurfaces  F = 0 they define in projective space , are very special in geometric terms, with many symmetries. They also include famous cases like the Fermat curves , and other examples well known in the theory of Diophantine equations .  A great deal has been worked out about their theory: algebraic geometry , local zeta-functions via Jacobi sums , Hardy-Littlewood circle method .  Examples         X  2   +   Y  2    -   Z  2    =  0           superscript  X  2    superscript  Y  2     superscript  Z  2    0    X^{2}+Y^{2}-Z^{2}=0   is the unit circle in P 2        X  2   -   Y  2   -   Z  2    =  0         superscript  X  2    superscript  Y  2    superscript  Z  2    0    X^{2}-Y^{2}-Z^{2}=0   is the unit hyperbola in P 2 .        x  0  3   +   x  1  3   +   x  2  3   +   x  3  3    =  0         superscript   subscript  x  0   3    superscript   subscript  x  1   3    superscript   subscript  x  2   3    superscript   subscript  x  3   3    0    x_{0}^{3}+x_{1}^{3}+x_{2}^{3}+x_{3}^{3}=0   gives the Fermat cubic surface in P 3 with 27 lines. The 27 lines in this example are easy to describe explicitly: they are the 9 lines of the form ( x : ax : y : by ) where a and b are fixed numbers with cube −1, and their 18 conjugates under permutations of coordinates.        x  0  4   +   x  1  4   +   x  2  4   +   x  3  4    =  0         superscript   subscript  x  0   4    superscript   subscript  x  1   4    superscript   subscript  x  2   4    superscript   subscript  x  3   4    0    x_{0}^{4}+x_{1}^{4}+x_{2}^{4}+x_{3}^{4}=0   gives a K3 surface in P 3 .
