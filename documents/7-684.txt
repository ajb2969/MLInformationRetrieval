Quasitriangular Hopf algebra

In mathematics, a Hopf algebra, H, is quasitriangular1 if there exists an invertible element, R, of 
 
 
 
  such that
:*
 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the coproduct on H, and the linear map 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 ,

where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , are algebra morphisms determined by









R is called the R-matrix.
As a consequence of the properties of quasitriangularity, the R-matrix, R, is a solution of the Yang-Baxter equation (and so a module V of H can be used to determine quasi-invariants of braids, knots and links). Also as a consequence of the properties of quasitriangularity, 
 
 
 
 ; moreover 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . One may further show that the antipode S must be a linear isomorphism, and thus S2 is an automorphism. In fact, S2 is given by conjugating by an invertible element
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  (cf. Ribbon Hopf algebras).
It is possible to construct a quasitriangular Hopf algebra from a Hopf algebra and its dual, using the Drinfeld quantum double construction.
Twisting
The property of being a quasi-triangular Hopf algebra is preserved by twisting via an invertible element 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and satisfying the cocycle condition



Furthermore, 
 
 
 
 
  is invertible and the twisted antipode is given by 
 
 
 
 , with the twisted comultiplication, R-matrix and co-unit change according to those defined for the quasi-triangular Quasi-Hopf algebra. Such a twist is known as an admissible (or Drinfeld) twist.
