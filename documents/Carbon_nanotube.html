<p><strong>Carbon nanotubes</strong> (<strong>CNTs</strong>) are <a href="allotropes_of_carbon" title="wikilink">allotropes of carbon</a> with a <a class="uri" href="cylindrical" title="wikilink">cylindrical</a> <a class="uri" href="nanostructure" title="wikilink">nanostructure</a>. Nanotubes have been constructed with length-to-diameter ratio of up to 132,000,000:1,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> significantly larger than for any other material. These cylindrical <a class="uri" href="carbon" title="wikilink">carbon</a> <a href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecules</a> have unusual properties, which are valuable for <a class="uri" href="nanotechnology" title="wikilink">nanotechnology</a>, <a class="uri" href="electronics" title="wikilink">electronics</a>, <a class="uri" href="optics" title="wikilink">optics</a> and other fields of <a href="materials_science" title="wikilink">materials science</a> and technology. In particular, owing to their extraordinary <a href="thermal_conductivity" title="wikilink">thermal conductivity</a> and mechanical and <a href="electricity" title="wikilink">electrical</a> properties, carbon nanotubes find applications as additives to various structural materials. For instance, nanotubes form a tiny portion of the material(s) in some (primarily <a href="carbon_fiber" title="wikilink">carbon fiber</a>) baseball bats, golf clubs, car parts or <a href="damascus_steel" title="wikilink">damascus steel</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Nanotubes are members of the <a class="uri" href="fullerene" title="wikilink">fullerene</a> structural family. Their name is derived from their long, hollow structure with the walls formed by one-atom-thick sheets of carbon, called <a class="uri" href="graphene" title="wikilink">graphene</a>. These sheets are rolled at specific and discrete ("<a href="chirality" title="wikilink">chiral</a>") angles, and the combination of the rolling angle and radius decides the nanotube properties; for example, whether the individual nanotube shell is a <a class="uri" href="metal" title="wikilink">metal</a> or <a class="uri" href="semiconductor" title="wikilink">semiconductor</a>. Nanotubes are categorized as <a href="#Single-walled" title="wikilink">single-walled nanotubes</a> (SWNTs) and <a href="#Multi-walled" title="wikilink">multi-walled nanotubes</a> (MWNTs). Individual nanotubes naturally align themselves into "ropes" held together by <a href="van_der_Waals_force" title="wikilink">van der Waals forces</a>, more specifically, pi-stacking.</p>

<p>Applied <a href="quantum_chemistry" title="wikilink">quantum chemistry</a>, specifically, <a href="orbital_hybridization" title="wikilink">orbital hybridization</a> best describes chemical bonding in nanotubes. The <a href="chemical_bonding" title="wikilink">chemical bonding</a> of nanotubes is composed entirely of <a href="Sp2_bond" title="wikilink"><em>sp</em><sup>2</sup> bonds</a>, similar to those of <a class="uri" href="graphite" title="wikilink">graphite</a>. These bonds, which are stronger than the <a href="Sp3_bond" title="wikilink"><em>sp</em><sup>3</sup> bonds</a> found in <a href="alkane" title="wikilink">alkanes</a> and <a class="uri" href="diamond" title="wikilink">diamond</a>, provide nanotubes with their unique strength. </p>

<p>There is no consensus on some terms describing carbon nanotubes in scientific literature: both "-wall" and "-walled" are being used in combination with "single", "double", "triple" or "multi", and the letter C is often omitted in the abbreviation; for example, multi-walled carbon nanotube (MWNT).</p>

<p>Most single-walled nanotubes (SWNTs) have a diameter of close to 1 nanometer, with a tube length that can be many millions of times longer. The structure of a SWNT can be conceptualized by wrapping a one-atom-thick layer of graphite called graphene into a seamless cylinder. The way the graphene sheet is wrapped is represented by a pair of indices (<em>n</em>,<em>m</em>). The integers <em>n</em> and <em>m</em> denote the number of unit <a href="Vector_(geometric)" title="wikilink">vectors</a> along two directions in the honeycomb <a href="crystal_lattice" title="wikilink">crystal lattice</a> of graphene. If <em>m</em> = 0, the nanotubes are called zigzag nanotubes, and if <em>n</em> = <em>m</em>, the nanotubes are called armchair nanotubes. Otherwise, they are called chiral. The diameter of an ideal nanotube can be calculated from its (n,m) indices as follows</p>

<p>SWNTs are an important variety of carbon nanotube because most of their properties change significantly with the (<em>n</em>,<em>m</em>) values, and this dependence is non-monotonic (see <a href="Optical_properties_of_carbon_nanotubes#Kataura_plot" title="wikilink">Kataura plot</a>). In particular, their <a href="band_gap" title="wikilink">band gap</a> can vary from zero to about 2 eV and their electrical conductivity can show metallic or semiconducting behavior. Single-walled nanotubes are likely candidates for miniaturizing electronics. The most basic building block of these systems is the electric wire, and SWNTs with diameters of an order of a nanometer can be excellent conductors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> One useful application of SWNTs is in the development of the first intermolecular <a href="field-effect_transistor" title="wikilink">field-effect transistors</a> (FET). The first intermolecular <a href="logic_gate" title="wikilink">logic gate</a> using SWCNT FETs was made in 2001.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> A logic gate requires both a p-FET and an n-FET. Because SWNTs are p-FETs when exposed to oxygen and n-FETs otherwise, it is possible to protect half of an SWNT from oxygen exposure, while exposing the other half to oxygen. This results in a single SWNT that acts as a <em>not</em> logic gate with both p and n-type FETs within the same molecule.</p>

<p> Single-walled nanotubes are dropping precipitously in price, from around $1500 per gram as of 2000 to retail prices of around $50 per gram of as-produced 40–60% by weight SWNTs as of March 2010.</p>

<p>SWNTs have been viewed as too expensive for widespread application but are forecast to make a large impact in electronics applications by 2020 according to The Global Market for Carbon Nanotubes report.</p>
<h3 id="multi-walled">Multi-walled</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>Multi-walled nanotubes (MWNTs) consist of multiple rolled layers (concentric tubes) of graphene. There are two models that can be used to describe the structures of multi-walled nanotubes. In the <em><a href="Matryoshka_doll" title="wikilink">Russian Doll</a></em> model, sheets of graphite are arranged in concentric cylinders, e.g., a (0,8) single-walled nanotube (SWNT) within a larger (0,17) single-walled nanotube. In the <em><a href="Scroll_(parchment)" title="wikilink">Parchment</a></em> model, a single sheet of graphite is rolled in around itself, resembling a scroll of parchment or a rolled newspaper. The interlayer distance in multi-walled nanotubes is close to the distance between graphene layers in graphite, approximately 3.4 Å. The Russian Doll structure is observed more commonly. Its individual shells can be described as SWNTs, which can be metallic or semiconducting. Because of statistical probability and restrictions on the relative diameters of the individual tubes, one of the shells, and thus the whole MWNT, is usually a zero-gap metal.</p>

<p>Double-walled carbon nanotubes (DWNTs) form a special class of nanotubes because their morphology and properties are similar to those of SWNTs but their resistance to chemicals is significantly improved. This is especially important when <a href="Surface_functionalization" title="wikilink">functionalization</a> is required (this means grafting of chemical functions at the surface of the nanotubes) to add new properties to the CNT. In the case of SWNTs, covalent functionalization will break some C=C <a href="double_bond" title="wikilink">double bonds</a>, leaving "holes" in the structure on the nanotube and, thus, modifying both its mechanical and electrical properties. In the case of DWNTs, only the outer wall is modified. DWNT synthesis on the gram-scale was first proposed in 2003<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> by the CCVD technique, from the selective reduction of oxide solutions in methane and hydrogen.</p>

<p>The telescopic motion ability of inner shells<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> and their unique mechanical properties<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> will permit the use of multi-walled nanotubes as main movable arms in coming nanomechanical devices. Retraction force that occurs to telescopic motion caused by the <a href="Lennard-Jones_interaction" title="wikilink">Lennard-Jones interaction</a> between shells and its value is about 1.5 nN.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="torus">Torus</h3>

<p>In theory, a nanotorus is a carbon nanotube bent into a <a class="uri" href="torus" title="wikilink">torus</a> (doughnut shape). Nanotori are predicted to have many unique properties, such as magnetic moments 1000 times larger than previously expected for certain specific radii.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Properties such as <a href="magnetic_moment" title="wikilink">magnetic moment</a>, thermal stability, etc. vary widely depending on radius of the torus and radius of the tube.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nanobud">Nanobud</h3>

<p> <a href="Carbon_nanobud" title="wikilink">Carbon nanobuds</a> are a newly created material combining two previously discovered allotropes of carbon: carbon nanotubes and <a href="fullerene" title="wikilink">fullerenes</a>. In this new material, fullerene-like "buds" are covalently bonded to the outer sidewalls of the underlying carbon nanotube. This hybrid material has useful properties of both fullerenes and carbon nanotubes. In particular, they have been found to be exceptionally good field emitters. In composite materials, the attached fullerene molecules may function as molecular anchors preventing slipping of the nanotubes, thus improving the composite’s mechanical properties.</p>
<h3 id="three-dimensional-carbon-nanotube-architectures">Three-dimensional carbon nanotube architectures</h3>

<p> Recently, several studies have highlighted the prospect of using carbon nanotubes as building blocks to fabricate three-dimensional macroscopic (&gt;1mm in all three dimensions) all-carbon devices. Lalwani et al. have reported a novel radical initiated thermal crosslinking method to fabricate macroscopic, free-standing, porous, all-carbon scaffolds using single- and multi-walled carbon nanotubes as building blocks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> These scaffolds possess macro-, micro-, and nano- structured pores and the porosity can be tailored for specific applications. These 3D all-carbon scaffolds/architectures may be used for the fabrication of the next generation of energy storage, supercapacitors, field emission transistors, high-performance catalysis, photovoltaics, and biomedical devices and implants. In addition, the mechanical behaviour of carbon nanotube micro-architectures can easily be modified by the infiltration and deposition of thin conformal coatings.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="graphenated-carbon-nanotubes-g-cnts">Graphenated carbon nanotubes (g-CNTs)</h3>

<p><embed src="SEM of carbon nanotubes with graphene foliates of varying density, deposited via microwave plasma enhanced CVD.tif" title="fig:SEM series of graphenated CNTs with varying foliate density"></embed> Graphenated CNTs are a relatively new hybrid that combines <a href="Graphite" title="wikilink">graphitic</a> foliates grown along the sidewalls of multiwalled or bamboo style CNTs. Yu <em>et al.</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> reported on "chemically bonded graphene leaves" growing along the sidewalls of CNTs. Stoner <em>et al.</em><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> described these structures as "graphenated CNTs" and reported in their use for enhanced <a class="uri" href="supercapacitor" title="wikilink">supercapacitor</a> performance. Hsu <em>et al.</em> further reported on similar structures formed on carbon fiber paper, also for use in <a class="uri" href="supercapacitor" title="wikilink">supercapacitor</a> applications.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> The foliate density can vary as a function of deposition conditions (e.g. temperature and time) with their structure ranging from few layers of <a class="uri" href="graphene" title="wikilink">graphene</a> (</p>

<p>The fundamental advantage of an integrated <a class="uri" href="graphene" title="wikilink">graphene</a>-CNT structure is the high surface area three-dimensional framework of the CNTs coupled with the high edge density of graphene. <a class="uri" href="Graphene" title="wikilink">Graphene</a> edges provide significantly higher charge density and reactivity than the basal plane, but they are difficult to arrange in a three-dimensional, high volume-density geometry. CNTs are readily aligned in a high density geometry (i.e., a vertically aligned forest)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> but lack high charge density surfaces—the sidewalls of the CNTs are similar to the basal plane of graphene and exhibit low charge density except where edge defects exist. Depositing a high density of graphene foliates along the length of aligned CNTs can significantly increase the total <a href="Capacitance" title="wikilink">charge capacity</a> per unit of nominal area as compared to other carbon nanostructures.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="nitrogen-doped-carbon-nanotubes">Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes</h3>

<p>Nitrogen doped carbon nanotubes (N-CNTs) can be produced through five main methods, <a href="chemical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">chemical vapor deposition</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> high-temperature and high-pressure reactions, gas-solid reaction of amorphous carbon with NH<sub>3</sub> at high temperature,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a> solid reaction,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a> and solvothermal synthesis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a></p>

<p>N-CNTs can also be prepared by a CVD method of pyrolyzing <a class="uri" href="melamine" title="wikilink">melamine</a> under Ar at elevated temperatures of 800–980 °C. However synthesis by CVD of melamine results in the formation of bamboo-structured CNTs. XPS spectra of grown N-CNTs reveal nitrogen in five main components, pyridinic nitrogen, pyrrolic nitrogen, quaternary nitrogen, and nitrogen oxides. Furthermore synthesis temperature affects the type of nitrogen configuration.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a></p>

<p>Nitrogen doping plays a pivotal role in <a class="uri" href="lithium" title="wikilink">lithium</a> storage, as it creates defects in the CNT walls allowing for Li ions to diffuse into interwall space. It also increases capacity by providing more favorable bind of N-doped sites. N-CNTs are also much more reactive to <a href="metal_oxide" title="wikilink">metal oxide</a> nanoparticle deposition which can further enhance storage capacity, especially in anode materials for <a href="Lithium-ion_battery" title="wikilink">Li-ion batteries</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> However boron-doped nanotubes have been shown to make batteries with triple capacity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></p>

<p>Cup-stacked carbon nanotubes (CSCNTs) differ from other quasi-1D carbon structures, which normally behave as quasi-metallic conductors of electrons. CSCNTs exhibit semiconducting behaviors due to the stacking microstructure of graphene layers.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="extreme-carbon-nanotubes">Extreme carbon nanotubes</h3>

<p> The observation of the <em>longest</em> carbon nanotubes grown so far are over 1/2 m (550 mm long) was reported in 2013.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> These nanotubes were grown on Si substrates using an improved <a href="chemical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">chemical vapor deposition</a> (CVD) method and represent electrically uniform arrays of single-walled carbon nanotubes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>shortest</em> carbon nanotube is the organic compound cycloparaphenylene, which was synthesized in early 2009.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>thinnest</em> carbon nanotube is the armchair (2,2) CNT with a diameter of 0.3 nm. This nanotube was grown inside a multi-walled carbon nanotube. Assigning of carbon nanotube type was done by a combination of <a href="high-resolution_transmission_electron_microscopy" title="wikilink">high-resolution transmission electron microscopy</a> (HRTEM), <a href="Raman_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">Raman spectroscopy</a> and <a href="density_functional_theory" title="wikilink">density functional theory</a> (DFT) calculations.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>thinnest freestanding</em> single-walled carbon nanotube is about 0.43 nm in diameter. Researchers suggested that it can be either (5,1) or (4,2) SWCNT, but the exact type of carbon nanotube remains questionable.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> (3,3), (4,3) and (5,1) carbon nanotubes (all about 0.4 nm in diameter) were unambiguously identified using aberration-corrected <a href="high-resolution_transmission_electron_microscopy" title="wikilink">high-resolution transmission electron microscopy</a> inside double-walled CNTs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a></p>

<p>The <em>highest density</em> of CNTs was achieved in 2013, grown on a conductive titanium-coated copper surface that was coated with co-catalysts cobalt and molybdenum at lower than typical temperatures of 450 °C. The tubes averaged a height of 380 nm and a mass density of 1.6 g cm<sup>−3</sup>.

<p>Carbon nanotubes are the strongest and stiffest materials yet discovered in terms of <a href="tensile_strength" title="wikilink">tensile strength</a> and <a href="elastic_modulus" title="wikilink">elastic modulus</a> respectively. This strength results from the covalent sp<sup>2</sup> bonds formed between the individual carbon atoms.

Further studies, such as one conducted in 2008, revealed that individual CNT shells have strengths of up to ~, which is in agreement with quantum/atomistic models.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Since carbon nanotubes have a low density for a solid of 1.3 to 1.4 g/cm<sup>3</sup>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn45" id="fnref45"><sup>45</sup></a> its <a href="specific_strength" title="wikilink">specific strength</a> of up to 48,000 kN·m·kg<sup>−1</sup> is the best of known materials, compared to high-carbon steel's 154 kN·m·kg<sup>−1</sup>.</p>

<p>Under excessive tensile strain, the tubes will undergo <a href="plastic_deformation" title="wikilink">plastic deformation</a>, which means the deformation is permanent. This deformation begins at strains of approximately 5% and can increase the maximum strain the tubes undergo before fracture by releasing strain energy.</p>

<p>Although the strength of individual CNT shells is extremely high, weak shear interactions between adjacent shells and tubes lead to significant reduction in the effective strength of multi-walled carbon nanotubes and carbon nanotube bundles down to only a few GPa.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn46" id="fnref46"><sup>46</sup></a> This limitation has been recently addressed by applying high-energy electron irradiation, which crosslinks inner shells and tubes, and effectively increases the strength of these materials to ~60 GPa for multi-walled carbon nanotubes<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn47" id="fnref47"><sup>47</sup></a> and ~17 GPa for double-walled carbon nanotube bundles.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn48" id="fnref48"><sup>48</sup></a></p>

<p><sup>E</sup>Experimental observation; <sup>T</sup>Theoretical prediction</p>

<p>The above discussion referred to axial properties of the nanotube, whereas simple geometrical considerations suggest that carbon nanotubes should be much softer in the radial direction than along the tube axis. Indeed, <a href="Transmission_electron_microscopy" title="wikilink">TEM</a> observation of radial elasticity suggested that even the van der Waals forces can deform two adjacent nanotubes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a> Nanoindentation experiments, performed by several groups on multiwalled carbon nanotubes<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> and tapping/contact mode <a href="atomic_force_microscope" title="wikilink">atomic force microscope</a> measurements performed on single-walled carbon nanotubes,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a> indicated a Young's modulus of the order of several GPa, confirming that CNTs are indeed rather soft in the radial direction.</p>
<h3 id="hardness">Hardness</h3>

<p>Standard single-walled carbon nanotubes can withstand a pressure up to 25 GPa without deformation. They then undergo a transformation to superhard phase nanotubes. Maximum pressures measured using current experimental techniques are around 55 GPa. However, these new superhard phase nanotubes collapse at an even higher, albeit unknown, pressure.</p>

<p>The <a href="bulk_modulus" title="wikilink">bulk modulus</a> of superhard phase nanotubes is 462 to 546 GPa, even higher than that of diamond (420 GPa for single diamond crystal).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="wettability">Wettability</h3>

<p>The surface wettability of CNT is of importance for its applications in various settings. Although the intrinsic contact angle of graphite is around 90°, the contact angles of most as-synthesized CNT arrays are over 160°, exhibiting a superhydrophobic property. By applying a low voltage as low as 1.3V, the extreme water repellant surface can be switched into superhydrophilic. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="kinetic-properties">Kinetic properties</h3>

<p>Multi-walled nanotubes are multiple concentric nanotubes precisely nested within one another. These exhibit a striking telescoping property whereby an inner nanotube core may slide, almost without friction, within its outer nanotube shell, thus creating an atomically perfect linear or rotational bearing. This is one of the first true examples of <a href="molecular_nanotechnology" title="wikilink">molecular nanotechnology</a>, the precise positioning of atoms to create useful machines. Already, this property has been utilized to create the world's smallest rotational <a href="Synthetic_molecular_motors" title="wikilink">motor</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a> Future applications such as a gigahertz mechanical oscillator are also envisioned.</p>
<h3 id="electrical-properties">Electrical properties</h3>

<p> Because of the symmetry and unique electronic structure of graphene, the structure of a nanotube strongly affects its electrical properties. For a given (<em>n</em>,<em>m</em>) nanotube, if <em>n</em> = <em>m</em>, the nanotube is metallic; if <em>n</em> − <em>m</em> is a multiple of 3, then the nanotube is semiconducting with a very small band gap, otherwise the nanotube is a moderate <a class="uri" href="semiconductor" title="wikilink">semiconductor</a>. Thus all armchair (<em>n</em> = <em>m</em>) nanotubes are metallic, and nanotubes (6,4), (9,1), etc. are semiconducting.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a></p>

<p>However, this rule has exceptions, because curvature effects in small diameter tubes can strongly influence electrical properties. Thus, a (5,0) SWCNT that should be semiconducting in fact is metallic according to the calculations. Likewise, zigzag and chiral SWCNTs with small diameters that should be metallic have a finite gap (armchair nanotubes remain metallic).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a> In theory, metallic nanotubes can carry an electric current density of 4 × 10<sup>9</sup> A/cm<sup>2</sup>, which is more than 1,000 times greater than those of metals such as <a class="uri" href="copper" title="wikilink">copper</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a> where for copper interconnects current densities are limited by <a class="uri" href="electromigration" title="wikilink">electromigration</a>.</p>

<p>Because of its nanoscale cross-section, electrons propagate only along the tube's axis. As a result, carbon nanotubes are frequently referred to as one-dimensional conductors. The maximum <a href="electrical_conductance" title="wikilink">electrical conductance</a> of a single-walled carbon nanotube is 2<em>G</em><sub>0</sub>, where <em>G</em><sub>0</sub> = 2<em>e</em><sup>2</sup>/<em>h</em> is the <a href="Conductance_quantum" title="wikilink">conductance of a single ballistic quantum channel</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a></p>

<p>Intrinsic <a class="uri" href="superconductivity" title="wikilink">superconductivity</a> has been reported,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> although other experiments found no evidence of this, leaving the claim a subject of debate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="optical-properties">Optical properties</h3>
<h3 id="thermal-properties">Thermal properties</h3>

<p>All nanotubes are expected to be very good <a href="thermal_conductor" title="wikilink">thermal conductors</a> along the tube, exhibiting a property known as "<a href="ballistic_conduction" title="wikilink">ballistic conduction</a>", but good insulators laterally to the tube axis. Measurements show that a SWNT has a room-temperature thermal conductivity along its axis of about 3500 W·m<sup>−1</sup>·K<sup>−1</sup>;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> compare this to copper, a metal well known for its good <a href="thermal_conductivity" title="wikilink">thermal conductivity</a>, which transmits 385 W·m<sup>−1</sup>·K<sup>−1</sup>. A SWNT has a room-temperature thermal conductivity across its axis (in the radial direction) of about 1.52 W·m<sup>−1</sup>·K<sup>−1</sup>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a> which is about as thermally conductive as soil. The temperature stability of carbon nanotubes is estimated to be up to 2800 °C in <a class="uri" href="vacuum" title="wikilink">vacuum</a> and about 750 °C in air.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="defects">Defects</h3>

<p>As with any material, the existence of a <a href="crystallographic_defect" title="wikilink">crystallographic defect</a> affects the material properties. Defects can occur in the form of atomic <a href="Vacancy_defect" title="wikilink">vacancies</a>. High levels of such defects can lower the tensile strength by up to 85%. An important example is the <a href="Stone_Wales_defect" title="wikilink">Stone Wales defect</a>, which creates a pentagon and heptagon pair by rearrangement of the bonds. Because of the very small structure of CNTs, the tensile strength of the tube is dependent on its weakest segment in a similar manner to a chain, where the strength of the weakest link becomes the maximum strength of the chain.</p>

<p>Crystallographic defects also affect the tube's electrical properties. A common result is lowered conductivity through the defective region of the tube. A defect in armchair-type tubes (which can conduct electricity) can cause the surrounding region to become semiconducting, and single monatomic vacancies induce magnetic properties.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a></p>

<p>Crystallographic defects strongly affect the tube's thermal properties. Such defects lead to <a class="uri" href="phonon" title="wikilink">phonon</a> scattering, which in turn increases the relaxation rate of the phonons. This reduces the <a href="mean_free_path" title="wikilink">mean free path</a> and reduces the thermal conductivity of nanotube structures. Phonon transport simulations indicate that substitutional defects such as nitrogen or boron will primarily lead to scattering of high-frequency optical phonons. However, larger-scale defects such as <a href="Stone_Wales_defect" title="wikilink">Stone Wales defects</a> cause phonon scattering over a wide range of frequencies, leading to a greater reduction in thermal conductivity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn75" id="fnref75"><sup>75</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="toxicity">Toxicity</h3>

<p>The toxicity of carbon nanotubes has been an important question in nanotechnology. As of 2007, such research had just begun. The data is still fragmentary and subject to criticism. Preliminary results highlight the difficulties in evaluating the toxicity of this heterogeneous material. Parameters such as structure, size <a href="Frequency_distribution" title="wikilink">distribution</a>, <a href="surface_area" title="wikilink">surface area</a>, surface chemistry, <a href="surface_charge" title="wikilink">surface charge</a>, and <a href="Flocculation" title="wikilink">agglomeration</a> state as well as purity of the samples, have considerable impact on the <a href="Reactivity_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">reactivity</a> of carbon nanotubes. However, available data clearly show that, under some conditions, nanotubes can cross membrane barriers, which suggests that, if raw materials reach the organs, they can induce harmful effects such as inflammatory and fibrotic reactions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn76" id="fnref76"><sup>76</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn77" id="fnref77"><sup>77</sup></a></p>

<p>Under certain conditions CNTs can enter human cells and accumulate in the <a class="uri" href="cytoplasm" title="wikilink">cytoplasm</a>, causing cell death.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn78" id="fnref78"><sup>78</sup></a></p>

<p>Results of rodent studies collectively show that regardless of the process by which CNTs were synthesized and the types and amounts of metals they contained, CNTs were capable of producing <a class="uri" href="inflammation" title="wikilink">inflammation</a>, <a href="Granuloma" title="wikilink">epithelioid granulomas</a> (microscopic nodules), <a class="uri" href="fibrosis" title="wikilink">fibrosis</a>, and biochemical/toxicological changes in the lungs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn79" id="fnref79"><sup>79</sup></a> Comparative toxicity studies in which mice were given equal weights of test materials showed that SWCNTs were more toxic than <a class="uri" href="quartz" title="wikilink">quartz</a>, which is considered a serious occupational health hazard when chronically inhaled. As a control, ultrafine <a href="carbon_black" title="wikilink">carbon black</a> was shown to produce minimal lung responses.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn80" id="fnref80"><sup>80</sup></a></p>

<p>Carbon nanotubes deposit in the <a href="alveolar_ducts" title="wikilink">alveolar ducts</a> by aligning lengthwise with the airways; the nanotubes will often combine with metals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn81" id="fnref81"><sup>81</sup></a> The needle-like fiber shape of CNTs is similar to <a href="asbestos_fibers" title="wikilink">asbestos fibers</a>. This raises the idea that widespread use of carbon nanotubes may lead to <a class="uri" href="pleural" title="wikilink">pleural</a> mesothelioma, a cancer of the lining of the lungs, or <a href="peritoneal_mesothelioma" title="wikilink">peritoneal mesothelioma</a>, a cancer of the lining of the abdomen (both caused by exposure to asbestos). A recently published pilot study supports this prediction.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn82" id="fnref82"><sup>82</sup></a> Scientists exposed the <a class="uri" href="mesothelial" title="wikilink">mesothelial</a> lining of the body cavity of mice to long multiwalled carbon nanotubes and observed asbestos-like, length-dependent, pathogenic behavior that included inflammation and formation of lesions known as <a class="uri" href="granulomas" title="wikilink">granulomas</a>. Authors of the study conclude: <mtpl></mtpl></p>

<p>Although further research is required, the available data suggest that under certain conditions, especially those involving chronic exposure, carbon nanotubes can pose a serious risk to human health.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn83" id="fnref83"><sup>83</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn84" id="fnref84"><sup>84</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn85" id="fnref85"><sup>85</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn86" id="fnref86"><sup>86</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="synthesis">Synthesis</h2>

<p> Techniques have been developed to produce nanotubes in sizable quantities, including arc discharge, laser ablation, high-pressure carbon monoxide disproportionation, and <a href="chemical_vapor_deposition" title="wikilink">chemical vapor deposition</a> (CVD). Most of these processes take place in a vacuum or with process gases. CVD growth of CNTs can occur in vacuum or at atmospheric pressure. Large quantities of nanotubes can be synthesized by these methods; advances in catalysis and continuous growth are making CNTs more commercially viable.</p>
<h3 id="arc-discharge">Arc discharge</h3>

<p>Nanotubes were observed in 1991 in the carbon soot of graphite <a href="electrode" title="wikilink">electrodes</a> during an arc discharge, by using a current of 100 <a href="ampere" title="wikilink">amps</a>, that was intended to produce fullerenes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn87" id="fnref87"><sup>87</sup></a> However the first <a class="uri" href="macroscopic" title="wikilink">macroscopic</a> production of carbon nanotubes was made in 1992 by two researchers at <a class="uri" href="NEC" title="wikilink">NEC</a>'s Fundamental Research Laboratory.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn88" id="fnref88"><sup>88</sup></a> The method used was the same as in 1991. During this process, the carbon contained in the negative electrode sublimates because of the high-discharge temperatures.</p>

<p>The yield for this method is up to 30% by weight and it produces both single- and multi-walled nanotubes with lengths of up to 50 micrometers with few structural defects.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn89" id="fnref89"><sup>89</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="laser-ablation">Laser ablation</h3>

<p>In laser ablation, a <a href="pulsed_laser" title="wikilink">pulsed laser</a> vaporizes a graphite target in a high-temperature reactor while an <a href="inert_gas" title="wikilink">inert gas</a> is bled into the chamber. Nanotubes develop on the cooler surfaces of the reactor as the vaporized carbon condenses. A water-cooled surface may be included in the system to collect the nanotubes.</p>

<p>This process was developed by Dr. <a href="Richard_Smalley" title="wikilink">Richard Smalley</a> and co-workers at <a href="Rice_University" title="wikilink">Rice University</a>, who at the time of the discovery of carbon nanotubes, were blasting metals with a laser to produce various metal molecules. When they heard of the existence of nanotubes they replaced the metals with graphite to create multi-walled carbon nanotubes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn90" id="fnref90"><sup>90</sup></a> Later that year the team used a composite of graphite and metal catalyst particles (the best yield was from a <a class="uri" href="cobalt" title="wikilink">cobalt</a> and <a class="uri" href="nickel" title="wikilink">nickel</a> mixture) to synthesize single-walled carbon nanotubes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn91" id="fnref91"><sup>91</sup></a></p>

<p>The laser ablation method yields around 70% and produces primarily single-walled carbon nanotubes with a controllable diameter determined by the reaction <a class="uri" href="temperature" title="wikilink">temperature</a>. However, it is more expensive than either arc discharge or chemical vapor deposition.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn92" id="fnref92"><sup>92</sup></a></p>

<p>The effective equation for few cycle optical pulse dynamics was obtained by virtue of the Boltzmann collision-less equation solution for conduction band electrons of semiconductor carbon nanotubes in the case when medium with carbon nanotubes has spatially-modulated refractive index. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn93" id="fnref93"><sup>93</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="plasma-torch">Plasma torch</h3>

<p>Single-walled carbon nanotubes can also be synthesized by a thermal plasma method. It was first invented in 2000 at INRS (Institut National de la Recherche Scientifique in Varennes, Canada), by Olivier Smiljanic. In this method, the aim is to reproduce the conditions prevailing in the arc discharge and laser ablation approaches, but a carbon-containing gas is used instead of graphite vapors to supply the carbon necessary for the production of SWNT. Doing so, the growth of SWNT is more efficient (decomposing a carbon containing gas can be 10 times less energy-consuming than graphite vaporization). It is also continuous and occurs at low cost. To produce a continuous process, a gas mixture composed of argon, ethylene and <a class="uri" href="ferrocene" title="wikilink">ferrocene</a> is introduced into a microwave plasma torch, where it is atomized by the atmospheric pressure plasma, which has the form of an intense 'flame'. The fumes created by the flame are found to contain SWNT, metallic and carbon nanoparticles and amorphous carbon.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn94" id="fnref94"><sup>94</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn95" id="fnref95"><sup>95</sup></a></p>

<p>Another way to produce single-walled carbon nanotubes with a plasma torch, is to use the induction thermal plasma method, implemented in 2005 by groups from the University of Sherbrooke and the National Research Council of Canada.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn96" id="fnref96"><sup>96</sup></a> The method is similar to arc-discharge in that both use ionized gas to reach the high temperature necessary to vaporize carbon-containing substances and the metal catalysts necessary for the ensuing nanotube growth. The thermal plasma is induced by high frequency oscillating currents in a coil, and is maintained in flowing inert gas. Typically, a feedstock of carbon black and metal catalyst particles is fed into the plasma, and then cooled down to form single-walled carbon nanotubes. Different single-wall carbon nanotube diameter distributions can be synthesized.</p>

<p>The induction thermal plasma method can produce up to 2 grams of nanotube material per minute, which is higher than the arc-discharge or the laser ablation methods.</p>
<h3 id="chemical-vapor-deposition-cvd">Chemical vapor deposition (CVD)</h3>

<p> The catalytic vapor phase deposition of carbon was reported in 1952<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn97" id="fnref97"><sup>97</sup></a> and 1959,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn98" id="fnref98"><sup>98</sup></a> but it was not until 1993<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn99" id="fnref99"><sup>99</sup></a> that carbon nanotubes were formed by this process. In 2007, researchers at the <a href="University_of_Cincinnati" title="wikilink">University of Cincinnati</a> (UC) developed a process to grow aligned carbon nanotube arrays of length 18 mm on a FirstNano ET3000 carbon nanotube growth system.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn100" id="fnref100"><sup>100</sup></a></p>

<p>During CVD, a substrate is prepared with a layer of metal catalyst particles, most commonly nickel, cobalt,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn101" id="fnref101"><sup>101</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a>, or a combination.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn102" id="fnref102"><sup>102</sup></a> The metal nanoparticles can also be produced by other ways, including reduction of oxides or oxides solid solutions. The diameters of the nanotubes that are to be grown are related to the size of the metal particles. This can be controlled by patterned (or masked) deposition of the metal, annealing, or by plasma etching of a metal layer. The substrate is heated to approximately 700 °C. To initiate the growth of nanotubes, two gases are bled into the reactor: a process gas (such as <a class="uri" href="ammonia" title="wikilink">ammonia</a>, <a class="uri" href="nitrogen" title="wikilink">nitrogen</a> or <a class="uri" href="hydrogen" title="wikilink">hydrogen</a>) and a carbon-containing gas (such as <a class="uri" href="acetylene" title="wikilink">acetylene</a>, <a class="uri" href="ethylene" title="wikilink">ethylene</a>, <a class="uri" href="ethanol" title="wikilink">ethanol</a> or <a class="uri" href="methane" title="wikilink">methane</a>). Nanotubes grow at the sites of the metal catalyst; the carbon-containing gas is broken apart at the surface of the catalyst particle, and the carbon is transported to the edges of the particle, where it forms the nanotubes. This mechanism is still being studied.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn103" id="fnref103"><sup>103</sup></a> The catalyst particles can stay at the tips of the growing nanotube during growth, or remain at the nanotube base, depending on the adhesion between the catalyst particle and the substrate.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn104" id="fnref104"><sup>104</sup></a> Thermal catalytic decomposition of hydrocarbon has become an active area of research and can be a promising route for the bulk production of CNTs. Fluidised bed reactor is the most widely used reactor for CNT preparation. Scale-up of the reactor is the major challenge.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn105" id="fnref105"><sup>105</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn106" id="fnref106"><sup>106</sup></a></p>

<p>CVD is the most widely used method for the production of carbon nanotubes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn107" id="fnref107"><sup>107</sup></a> For this purpose, the metal nanoparticles are mixed with a catalyst support such as MgO or Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> to increase the surface area for higher yield of the catalytic reaction of the carbon feedstock with the metal particles. One issue in this synthesis route is the removal of the catalyst support via an acid treatment, which sometimes could destroy the original structure of the carbon nanotubes. However, alternative catalyst supports that are soluble in water have proven effective for nanotube growth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn108" id="fnref108"><sup>108</sup></a></p>

<p>If a <a href="plasma_(physics)" title="wikilink">plasma</a> is generated by the application of a strong electric field during growth (plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition), then the nanotube growth will follow the direction of the electric field.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn109" id="fnref109"><sup>109</sup></a> By adjusting the geometry of the reactor it is possible to synthesize vertically aligned carbon nanotubes<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn110" id="fnref110"><sup>110</sup></a> (i.e., perpendicular to the substrate), a morphology that has been of interest to researchers interested in electron emission from nanotubes. Without the plasma, the resulting nanotubes are often randomly oriented. Under certain reaction conditions, even in the absence of a plasma, closely spaced nanotubes will maintain a vertical growth direction resulting in a dense array of tubes resembling a carpet or forest.</p>

<p>Of the various means for nanotube synthesis, CVD shows the most promise for industrial-scale deposition, because of its price/unit ratio, and because CVD is capable of growing nanotubes directly on a desired substrate, whereas the nanotubes must be collected in the other growth techniques. The growth sites are controllable by careful deposition of the catalyst.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn111" id="fnref111"><sup>111</sup></a> In 2007, a team from <a href="Meijo_University" title="wikilink">Meijo University</a> demonstrated a high-efficiency CVD technique for growing carbon nanotubes from <a class="uri" href="camphor" title="wikilink">camphor</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn112" id="fnref112"><sup>112</sup></a> Researchers at <a href="Rice_University" title="wikilink">Rice University</a>, until recently led by the late <a href="Richard_Smalley" title="wikilink">Richard Smalley</a>, have concentrated upon finding methods to produce large, pure amounts of particular types of nanotubes. Their approach grows long fibers from many small seeds cut from a single nanotube; all of the resulting fibers were found to be of the same diameter as the original nanotube and are expected to be of the same type as the original nanotube.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn113" id="fnref113"><sup>113</sup></a></p>

The synthesis efficiency is about 100 times higher than for the <a href="laser_ablation" title="wikilink">laser ablation</a> method. The time required to make SWNT forests of the height of 2.5 mm by this method was 10 minutes in 2004. Those SWNT forests can be easily separated from the catalyst, yielding clean SWNT material (purity &gt;99.98%) without further purification. For comparison, the as-grown HiPco CNTs contain about 5–35%<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn117" id="fnref117"><sup>117</sup></a> of metal impurities; it is therefore purified through dispersion and centrifugation that damages the nanotubes. Super-growth avoids this problem. Patterned highly organized single-walled nanotube structures were successfully fabricated using the super-growth technique.</p>

<p>The <a href="mass_density" title="wikilink">mass density</a> of super-growth CNTs is about 0.037 g/cm<sup>3</sup>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn118" id="fnref118"><sup>118</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn119" id="fnref119"><sup>119</sup></a> It is much lower than that of conventional CNT powders (~1.34 g/cm<sup>3</sup>), probably because the latter contain metals and <a href="amorphous_carbon" title="wikilink">amorphous carbon</a>.</p>

<p>The super-growth method is basically a variation of CVD.

Many MWNTs are included so that the diameter of the tube is wide.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn121" id="fnref121"><sup>121</sup></a></p>

<p>The vertically aligned nanotube forests originate from a "zipping effect" when they are immersed in a solvent and dried. The zipping effect is caused by the surface tension of the solvent and the van der Waals forces between the carbon nanotubes. It aligns the nanotubes into a dense material, which can be formed in various shapes, such as sheets and bars, by applying weak compression during the process. Densification increases the <a href="Vickers_hardness" title="wikilink">Vickers hardness</a> by about 70 times and density is 0.55 g/cm<sup>3</sup>. The packed carbon nanotubes are more than 1 mm long and have a carbon purity of 99.9% or higher; they also retain the desirable alignment properties of the nanotubes forest.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn122" id="fnref122"><sup>122</sup></a></p>

<p> Many electronic applications of carbon nanotubes crucially rely on techniques of selectively producing either semiconducting or metallic CNTs, preferably of a certain chirality. Several methods of separating semiconducting and metallic CNTs are known, but most of them are not yet suitable for large-scale technological processes. The most efficient method relies on density-gradient ultracentrifugation, which separates surfactant-wrapped nanotubes by the minute difference in their density. This density difference often translates into difference in the nanotube diameter and (semi)conducting properties.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn140" id="fnref140"><sup>140</sup></a> Another method of separation uses a sequence of freezing, thawing, and compression of SWNTs embedded in <a class="uri" href="agarose" title="wikilink">agarose</a> gel. This process results in a solution containing 70% metallic SWNTs and leaves a gel containing 95% semiconducting SWNTs. The diluted solutions separated by this method show various colors.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn141" id="fnref141"><sup>141</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn142" id="fnref142"><sup>142</sup></a> The separated carbon nanotubes using this method have been applied to electrodes, e.g. electric double-layer capacitor.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn143" id="fnref143"><sup>143</sup></a> Moreover, SWNTs can be separated by the <a href="column_chromatography" title="wikilink">column chromatography</a> method. Yield is 95% in semiconductor type SWNT and 90% in metallic type SWNT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn144" id="fnref144"><sup>144</sup></a></p>

<p>In addition to separation of semiconducting and metallic SWNTs, it is possible to sort SWNTs by length, diameter, and chirality. The highest resolution length sorting, with length variation of  SWNT diameter separation has been achieved by density-gradient ultracentrifugation (DGU)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn145" id="fnref145"><sup>145</sup></a> using surfactant-dispersed SWNTs and by ion-exchange chromatography (IEC) for DNA-SWNT.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn146" id="fnref146"><sup>146</sup></a> Purification of individual chiralities has also been demonstrated with IEC of DNA-SWNT: specific short DNA oligomers can be used to isolate individual SWNT chiralities. Thus far, 12 chiralities have been isolated at purities ranging from 70% for (8,3) and (9,5) SWNTs to 90% for (6,5), (7,5) and (10,5)SWNTs.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn147" id="fnref147"><sup>147</sup></a> There have been successful efforts to integrate these purified nanotubes into devices, e. g.

<p>An alternative to separation is development of a selective growth of semiconducting or metallic CNTs.

<p>In November 2012 researchers at the American <a href="National_Institute_of_Standards_and_Technology" title="wikilink">National Institute of Standards and Technology</a> (NIST) proved that single-wall carbon nanotubes may help protect DNA molecules from damage by <a class="uri" href="oxidation" title="wikilink">oxidation</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn166" id="fnref166"><sup>166</sup></a></p>

<p>A highly effective method of delivering carbon nanotubes into cells is <a href="CellSqueeze" title="wikilink">Cell squeezing</a>, a high-throughput vector-free microfluidic platform for intracellular delivery developed at the <a href="Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">Massachusetts Institute of Technology</a> in the labs of <a href="Robert_S._Langer" title="wikilink">Robert S.

<p>Carbon nanotubes have furthermore been grown inside microfluidic channels for chemical analysis, based on electrochromatography. Here, the high surface-area-to-volume ratio and high hydrophobicity of CNTs are used in order to greatly decrease the analysis time of small neutral molecules that typically require large bulky equipment for analysis.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn168" id="fnref168"><sup>168</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn169" id="fnref169"><sup>169</sup></a></p>

<p>Because of the carbon nanotube's superior mechanical properties, many structures have been proposed ranging from everyday items like clothes and sports gear to combat jackets and <a href="space_elevator" title="wikilink">space elevators</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn170" id="fnref170"><sup>170</sup></a> However, the space elevator will require further efforts in refining carbon nanotube technology, as the practical tensile strength of carbon nanotubes must be greatly improved.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn171" id="fnref171"><sup>171</sup></a></p>

<p>For perspective, outstanding breakthroughs have already been made. Pioneering work led by Ray H. Baughman at the NanoTech Institute has shown that single and multi-walled nanotubes can produce materials with toughness unmatched in the man-made and natural worlds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn172" id="fnref172"><sup>172</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn173" id="fnref173"><sup>173</sup></a></p>

<p> Carbon nanotubes are also a promising material as building blocks in bio-mimetic hierarchical composite materials given their exceptional mechanical properties (~1 TPa in modulus, and ~100 GPa in strength). Initial attempts to incorporate CNTs into hierarchical structures led to mechanical properties that were significantly lower than these achievable limits. Windle <em>et al.</em> have used an <em>in situ</em> chemical vapor deposition (CVD) spinning method to produce continuous CNT yarns from CVD-grown CNT aerogels.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn174" id="fnref174"><sup>174</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn175" id="fnref175"><sup>175</sup></a> With this technology, they fabricated CNT yarns with strengths as high as ~9 GPa at small gage lengths of ~1 mm, however, defects resulted in a reduction of specific strength to ~1 GPa at 20 mm gage length.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn176" id="fnref176"><sup>176</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn177" id="fnref177"><sup>177</sup></a> Espinosa <em>et al.</em> developed high performance DWNT-polymer composite yarns by twisting and stretching ribbons of randomly oriented bundles of DWNTs thinly coated with polymeric organic compounds.

<p>Because of the high mechanical strength of carbon nanotubes, research is being made into weaving them into clothes to create stab-proof and bulletproof clothing. The nanotubes would effectively stop the bullet from penetrating the body, although the bullet's kinetic energy would likely cause broken bones and internal bleeding.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn180" id="fnref180"><sup>180</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="electrical-circuits">Electrical circuits</h3>

<p>Nanotube-based <a href="transistor" title="wikilink">transistors</a>, also known as <a href="carbon_nanotube_field-effect_transistor" title="wikilink">carbon nanotube field-effect transistors</a> (CNTFETs), have been made that operate at room temperature and that are capable of digital switching using a single electron.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn181" id="fnref181"><sup>181</sup></a> However, one major obstacle to realization of nanotubes has been the lack of technology for mass production. In 2001 IBM researchers demonstrated how metallic nanotubes can be destroyed, leaving semiconducting ones behind for use as transistors. Their process is called "constructive destruction," which includes the automatic destruction of defective nanotubes on the <a href="wafer_(electronics)" title="wikilink">wafer</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn182" id="fnref182"><sup>182</sup></a> This process, however, only gives control over the electrical properties on a statistical scale.</p>

<p>The potential of carbon nanotubes was demonstrated in 2003 when room-temperature ballistic transistors with ohmic metal contacts and <a href="High-k_dielectric" title="wikilink">high-k gate</a> dielectric were reported, showing 20–30x higher ON current than state-of-the-art Si <a href="MOSFET" title="wikilink">MOSFETs</a>. This presented an important advance in the field as CNT was shown to potentially outperform Si. At the time, a major challenge was ohmic metal contact formation. In this regard, <a class="uri" href="palladium" title="wikilink">palladium</a>, which is a high-<a href="work_function" title="wikilink">work function</a> metal was shown to exhibit <a href="Schottky_barrier" title="wikilink">Schottky barrier</a>-free contacts to semiconducting nanotubes with diameters &gt;1.7 nm.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn183" id="fnref183"><sup>183</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn184" id="fnref184"><sup>184</sup></a></p>

<p>The first nanotube integrated memory circuit was made in 2004. One of the main challenges has been regulating the conductivity of nanotubes. Depending on subtle surface features a nanotube may act as a plain <a href="Electrical_conductor" title="wikilink">conductor</a> or as a semiconductor. A fully automated method has however been developed to remove non-semiconductor tubes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn185" id="fnref185"><sup>185</sup></a></p>

<p>Another way to make carbon nanotube transistors has been to use random networks of them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn186" id="fnref186"><sup>186</sup></a> By doing so one averages all of their electrical differences and one can produce devices in large scale at the wafer level.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn187" id="fnref187"><sup>187</sup></a> This approach was first patented by Nanomix Inc.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn188" id="fnref188"><sup>188</sup></a> (date of original application June 2002<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn189" id="fnref189"><sup>189</sup></a>). It was first published in the academic literature by the <a href="United_States_Naval_Research_Laboratory" title="wikilink">United States Naval Research Laboratory</a> in 2003 through independent research work.

<p>Large structures of carbon nanotubes can be used for thermal management of electronic circuits. An approximately 1 mm–thick carbon nanotube layer was used as a special material to fabricate coolers, this material has very low density, ~20 times lower weight than a similar copper structure, while the cooling properties are similar for the two materials.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn192" id="fnref192"><sup>192</sup></a></p>

<p>Wires for carrying electric current may be fabricated from pure nanotubes and nanotube-polymer composites. It has already been demonstrated that carbon nanotube wires can successfully be used for power or data transmission.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn196" id="fnref196"><sup>196</sup></a> Recently small wires have been fabricated with specific conductivity exceeding copper and aluminum;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn197" id="fnref197"><sup>197</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn198" id="fnref198"><sup>198</sup></a> these cables are the highest conductivity carbon nanotube and also highest conductivity non-metal cables.

Thus, this Carbon nanotube-copper (CNT-Cu) composite possesses the highest observed current-carrying capacity among electrical conductors. Thus for a given cross-section of electrical conductor, the CNT-Cu composite can withstand and transport one hundred times higher current compared to metals such as copper and gold.</p>
<h3 id="actuators">Actuators</h3>

<p>The exceptional electrical and mechanical properties of carbon nanotubes have made them alternatives to the traditional electrical actuators for both microscopic and macroscopic applications. Carbon nanotubes are very good conductors of both electricity and heat, and they are also very strong and elastic molecules in certain directions.</p>
<h3 id="paper-batteries">Paper batteries</h3>

<p>A <a href="paper_battery" title="wikilink">paper battery</a> is a <a href="Battery_(electricity)" title="wikilink">battery</a> engineered to use a paper-thin sheet of <a class="uri" href="cellulose" title="wikilink">cellulose</a> (which is the major constituent of regular paper, among other things) infused with aligned carbon nanotubes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn200" id="fnref200"><sup>200</sup></a> The nanotubes act as <a class="uri" href="electrodes" title="wikilink">electrodes</a>; allowing the storage devices to conduct electricity.

<h3 id="solar-cells">Solar cells</h3>

<p>One of the promising applications of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs) is their use in solar panels, due to their strong UV/Vis-NIR absorption characteristics. Research has shown that they can provide a sizable increase in efficiency, even at their current unoptimized state. Solar cells developed at the <a href="New_Jersey_Institute_of_Technology" title="wikilink">New Jersey Institute of Technology</a> use a carbon nanotube complex, formed by a mixture of carbon nanotubes and carbon <a href="Buckyball_(molecule)" title="wikilink">buckyballs</a> (known as <a href="fullerene" title="wikilink">fullerenes</a>) to form snake-like structures. Buckyballs trap electrons, but they can't make electrons flow. Add sunlight to excite the polymers, and the buckyballs will grab the electrons. Nanotubes, behaving like copper wires, will then be able to make the electrons or current flow.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn201" id="fnref201"><sup>201</sup></a></p>

<p>Additional research has been conducted on creating SWNT hybrid solar panels to increase the efficiency further. These hybrids are created by combining SWNT's with photo-excitable electron donors to increase the number of electrons generated. It has been found that the interaction between the photo-excited <a class="uri" href="porphyrin" title="wikilink">porphyrin</a> and SWNT generates electro-hole pairs at the SWNT surfaces. This phenomenon has been observed experimentally, and contributes practically to an increase in efficiency up to 8.5%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn202" id="fnref202"><sup>202</sup></a> </p>
<h3 id="hydrogen-storage">Hydrogen storage</h3>

<p>In addition to being able to store electrical energy, there has been some research in using carbon nanotubes to store hydrogen to be used as a fuel source. By taking advantage of the capillary effects of the small carbon nanotubes, it is possible to condense gases in high density inside single-walled nanotubes. This allows for gases, most notably hydrogen (H<sub>2</sub>), to be stored at high densities without being condensed into a liquid. Potentially, this storage method could be used on vehicles in place of gas fuel tanks for a hydrogen-powered car. A current issue regarding hydrogen-powered vehicles is the on-board storage of the fuel. Current storage methods involve cooling and condensing the H<sub>2</sub> gas to a liquid state for storage which causes a loss of potential energy (25–45%) when compared to the energy associated with the gaseous state. Storage using SWNTs would allow one to keep the H2 in its gaseous state, thereby increasing the storage efficiency. This method allows for a volume to energy ratio slightly smaller to that of current gas powered vehicles, allowing for a slightly lower but comparable range.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn203" id="fnref203"><sup>203</sup></a></p>

<p>An area of controversy and frequent experimentation regarding the storage of hydrogen by adsorption in carbon nanotubes is the efficiency by which this process occurs. The effectiveness of hydrogen storage is integral to its use as a primary fuel source since hydrogen only contains about one fourth the energy per unit volume as gasoline. Studies however show that what is the most important is the surface area of the materials used. Hence activated carbon with surface area of 2600 m2/g can store up to 5,8% w/w. In all these carbonaceous materials, hydrogen is stored by physisorption at 70-90K.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn204" id="fnref204"><sup>204</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="experimental-capacity">Experimental capacity</h4>

<p>One experiment<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn205" id="fnref205"><sup>205</sup></a> sought to determine the amount of hydrogen stored in CNTs by utilizing <a href="elastic_recoil_detection_analysis" title="wikilink">elastic recoil detection analysis</a> (ERDA). CNTs (primarily SWNTs) were synthesized via <a href="chemical_vapor_disposition" title="wikilink">chemical vapor disposition</a> (CVD) and subjected to a two-stage purification process including air oxidation and acid treatment, then formed into flat, uniform discs and exposed to pure, pressurized hydrogen at various temperatures. When the data was analyzed, it was found that the ability of CNTs to store hydrogen decreased as temperature increased. Moreover, the highest hydrogen concentration measured was ~0.18%; significantly lower than commercially viable hydrogen storage needs to be. A separate experimental work performed by using a gravimetric method also revealed the maximum hydrogen uptake capacity of CNTs to be as low as 0.2%.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn206" id="fnref206"><sup>206</sup></a></p>

<p>In another experiment,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn207" id="fnref207"><sup>207</sup></a> CNTs were synthesized via CVD and their structure was characterized using <a href="Raman_spectroscopy" title="wikilink">Raman spectroscopy</a>. Utilizing <a href="microwave_digestion" title="wikilink">microwave digestion</a>, the samples were exposed to different acid concentrations and different temperatures for various amounts of time in an attempt to find the optimum purification method for SWNTs of the diameter determined earlier. The purified samples were then exposed to hydrogen gas at various high pressures, and their <a class="uri" href="adsorption" title="wikilink">adsorption</a> by weight percent was plotted. The data showed that hydrogen adsorption levels of up to 3.7% are possible with a very pure sample and under the proper conditions. It is thought that microwave digestion helps improve the hydrogen adsorption capacity of the CNTs by opening up the ends, allowing access to the inner cavities of the nanotubes.</p>
<h4 id="limitations-on-efficient-hydrogen-adsorption">Limitations on efficient hydrogen adsorption</h4>

<p>The biggest obstacle to efficient hydrogen storage using CNTs is the purity of the nanotubes. To achieve maximum hydrogen adsorption, there must be minimum <a class="uri" href="graphene" title="wikilink">graphene</a>, amorphous carbon, and metallic deposits in the nanotube sample. Current methods of CNT synthesis require a purification step. However, even with pure nanotubes, the absorption capacity is only maximized under high pressures, which are undesirable in commercial fuel tanks.</p>
<h3 id="supercapacitor">Supercapacitor</h3>

<p>MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics uses nanotubes to improve <a class="uri" href="supercapacitors" title="wikilink">supercapacitors</a>. The activated charcoal used in conventional ultracapacitors has many small hollow spaces of various size, which create together a large surface to store electric charge. But as charge is quantized into elementary charges, i.e. electrons, and each such elementary charge needs a minimum space, a significant fraction of the electrode surface is not available for storage because the hollow spaces are not compatible with the charge's requirements. With a nanotube electrode the spaces may be tailored to size—few too large or too small—and consequently the capacity should be increased considerably.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn208" id="fnref208"><sup>208</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="radar-absorption">Radar absorption</h3>

<p>Radars work in the microwave frequency range, which can be absorbed by MWNTs. Applying the MWNTs to the aircraft would cause the radar to be absorbed and therefore seem to have a smaller <a href="radar_cross-section" title="wikilink">radar cross-section</a>. One such application could be to paint the nanotubes onto the plane. Recently there has been some work done at the <a href="University_of_Michigan" title="wikilink">University of Michigan</a> regarding carbon nanotubes usefulness as <a href="stealth_technology" title="wikilink">stealth technology</a> on aircraft. It has been found that in addition to the radar absorbing properties, the nanotubes neither reflect nor scatter visible light, making it essentially invisible at night, much like painting current <a href="stealth_aircraft" title="wikilink">stealth aircraft</a> black except much more effective. Current limitations in manufacturing, however, mean that current production of nanotube-coated aircraft is not possible. One theory to overcome these current limitations is to cover small particles with the nanotubes and suspend the nanotube-covered particles in a medium such as paint, which can then be applied to a surface, like a stealth aircraft.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn209" id="fnref209"><sup>209</sup></a></p>

<p>A spray-on mixture of carbon nanotubes and ceramic demonstrates unprecedented ability to resist damage while absorbing laser light. Such coatings that absorb as the energy of high-powered lasers without breaking down are essential for optical power detectors that measure the output of such lasers. These are used, for example, in military equipment for defusing unexploded mines. The composite consists of multiwall carbon nanotubes and a ceramic made of silicon, carbon and nitrogen. Including boron boosts the breakdown temperature. The nanotubes and graphene-like carbon transmit heat well, while the oxidation-resistant ceramic boosts damage resistance. Creating the coating involves dispersing the nanotubes in <a class="uri" href="toluene" title="wikilink">toluene</a>, to which a clear liquid polymer containing boron was added. The mixture was heated to . The result is crushed into a fine powder, dispersed again in toluene and sprayed in a thin coat on a copper surface. The coating absorbed 97.5 percent of the light from a far-infrared laser and tolerated 15 kilowatts per square centimeter for 10 seconds. Damage tolerance is about 50 percent higher than for similar coatings, e.g., nanotubes alone and carbon paint.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn220" id="fnref220"><sup>220</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn221" id="fnref221"><sup>221</sup></a></p>

<p>A CNT nano-structured sponge (nanosponge) containing sulfur and iron is more effective at soaking up water contaminants such as oil, fertilizers, pesticides and pharmaceuticals.

<p>Carbon nanotubes have been implemented in nanoelectromechanical systems, including mechanical memory elements (<a href="Nano-RAM" title="wikilink">NRAM</a> being developed by <a href="Nantero" title="wikilink">Nantero Inc.</a>) and nanoscale electric motors (see <a class="uri" href="Nanomotor" title="wikilink">Nanomotor</a> or <a href="Nanotube_nanomotor" title="wikilink">Nanotube nanomotor</a>).</p>

<p>Carboxyl-modified single-walled carbon nanotubes (so called zig-zag, armchair type) can act as sensors of atoms and ions of alkali metals Na, Li, K.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn234" id="fnref234"><sup>234</sup></a> In May 2005, Nanomix Inc. placed on the market a hydrogen sensor that integrated carbon nanotubes on a silicon platform. Since then, Nanomix has been patenting many such sensor applications, such as in the field of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, glucose, DNA detection, etc. End of 2014, Tulane University researchers have tested Nanomix's fast and fully automated point of care diagnostic system in Sierra Leone to help for rapid testing for <a class="uri" href="Ebola" title="wikilink">Ebola</a>. Nanomix announced that a product could be launched within three to six months.</p>

Carbon nanotube films are substantially more mechanically robust than ITO films, making them ideal for high-reliability <a href="touchscreen" title="wikilink">touchscreens</a> and flexible displays. Printable water-based inks of carbon nanotubes are desired to enable the production of these films to replace ITO.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn235" id="fnref235"><sup>235</sup></a> Nanotube films show promise for use in displays for computers, cell phones, <a href="Personal_digital_assistant" title="wikilink">PDAs</a>, and <a href="Automated_teller_machine" title="wikilink">ATMs</a>.</p>

<p>A <a class="uri" href="nanoradio" title="wikilink">nanoradio</a>, a radio receiver consisting of a single nanotube, was demonstrated in 2007.</p>

<p>A <a class="uri" href="flywheel" title="wikilink">flywheel</a> made of carbon nanotubes could be spun at extremely high velocity on a floating magnetic axis in a vacuum, and potentially store energy at a <a href="Energy_density" title="wikilink">density</a> approaching that of conventional fossil fuels. Since energy can be added to and removed from flywheels very efficiently in the form of electricity, this might offer a way of <a href="Grid_energy_storage" title="wikilink">storing electricity</a>, making the electrical grid more efficient and variable power suppliers (like wind turbines) more useful in meeting energy needs. The practicality of this depends heavily upon the cost of making massive, unbroken nanotube structures, and their failure rate under stress.</p>

<p><a href="Carbon_nanotube_springs" title="wikilink">Carbon nanotube springs</a> have the potential to indefinitely store elastic potential energy at ten times the density of lithium-ion batteries with flexible charge and discharge rates and extremely high cycling durability.</p>

<p>Ultra-short SWNTs (US-tubes) have been used as nanoscaled capsules for delivering MRI contrast agents in vivo.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn236" id="fnref236"><sup>236</sup></a></p>

<p>Carbon nanotubes provide a certain potential for <a href="carbocatalysis" title="wikilink">metal-free catalysis</a> of inorganic and organic reactions. For instance, oxygen groups attached to the surface of carbon nanotubes have the potential to catalyze oxidative <a href="dehydrogenation" title="wikilink">dehydrogenations</a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn237" id="fnref237"><sup>237</sup></a> or selective <a class="uri" href="oxidations" title="wikilink">oxidations</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn238" id="fnref238"><sup>238</sup></a> Nitrogen-doped carbon nanotubes may replace <a class="uri" href="platinum" title="wikilink">platinum</a> catalysts used to reduce oxygen in <a href="fuel_cell" title="wikilink">fuel cells</a>. A forest of vertically aligned nanotubes can reduce oxygen in alkaline solution more effectively than platinum, which has been used in such applications since the 1960s. Here, the nanotubes have the added benefit of not being subject to carbon monoxide poisoning.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn239" id="fnref239"><sup>239</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Wake_Forest_University" title="wikilink">Wake Forest University</a> engineers are using multiwalled carbon nanotubes to enhance the brightness of <a href="field-induced_polymer_electroluminescent" title="wikilink">field-induced polymer electroluminescent</a> technology, potentially offering a step forward in the search for safe, pleasing, high-efficiency lighting. In this technology, moldable polymer matrix emits light when exposed to an electric current. It could eventually yield high-efficiency lights without the mercury vapor of <a href="compact_fluorescent_lamps" title="wikilink">compact fluorescent lamps</a> or the bluish tint of some fluorescents and LEDs, which has been linked with circadian rhythm disruption.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn240" id="fnref240"><sup>240</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="discovery">Discovery</h2>

<p>The true identity of the discoverers of carbon nanotubes is a subject of some controversy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn244" id="fnref244"><sup>244</sup></a> For years, scientists assumed that <a href="Sumio_Iijima" title="wikilink">Sumio Iijima</a> of <a class="uri" href="NEC" title="wikilink">NEC</a> had discovered carbon nanotubes in 1991. He published a paper describing his discovery which initiated a flurry of excitement and could be credited by inspiring the many scientists now studying applications of carbon nanotubes. Though Iijima has been given much of the credit for discovering carbon nanotubes, it turns out that the timeline of carbon nanotubes goes back much further than 1991.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn245" id="fnref245"><sup>245</sup></a> In 1952 L. V. Radushkevich and V. M. Lukyanovich published clear images of 50 nanometer diameter tubes made of carbon in the Soviet <em>Journal of Physical Chemistry</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn246" id="fnref246"><sup>246</sup></a> This discovery was largely unnoticed, as the article was published in Russian, and Western scientists' access to Soviet press was limited during the <a href="Cold_War" title="wikilink">Cold War</a>. Before they came to be known as carbon nanotubes, in 1976, <a href="Morinobu_Endo" title="wikilink">Morinobu Endo</a> of <a class="uri" href="CNRS" title="wikilink">CNRS</a> observed hollow tubes of rolled up graphite sheets synthesised by a chemical vapour-growth technique.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn247" id="fnref247"><sup>247</sup></a> The first specimens observed would later come to be known as single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWNTs).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn248" id="fnref248"><sup>248</sup></a> The three scientists have been the first ones to show images of a nanotube with a solitary graphene wall.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn249" id="fnref249"><sup>249</sup></a></p>

<p>Endo, in his early review of vapor-phase-grown carbon fibers (VPCF), also reminded us that he had observed a hollow tube, linearly extended with parallel carbon layer faces near the fiber core.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn250" id="fnref250"><sup>250</sup></a> This appears to be the observation of multi-walled carbon nanotubes at the center of the fiber.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn251" id="fnref251"><sup>251</sup></a> The mass-produced MWCNTs today are strongly related to the VPGCF developed by Endo.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn252" id="fnref252"><sup>252</sup></a> In fact, they call it the “Endo-process”, out of respect for his early work and patents<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn253" id="fnref253"><sup>253</sup></a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn254" id="fnref254"><sup>254</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1979, John Abrahamson presented evidence of carbon nanotubes at the 14th Biennial Conference of Carbon at <a href="Pennsylvania_State_University" title="wikilink">Pennsylvania State University</a>. The conference paper described carbon nanotubes as carbon fibers that were produced on carbon anodes during arc discharge. A characterization of these fibers was given as well as hypotheses for their growth in a nitrogen atmosphere at low pressures.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn255" id="fnref255"><sup>255</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1981, a group of Soviet scientists published the results of chemical and structural characterization of carbon nanoparticles produced by a thermocatalytical disproportionation of carbon monoxide. Using TEM images and <a href="X-ray_scattering_techniques" title="wikilink">XRD</a> patterns, the authors suggested that their “carbon multi-layer tubular crystals” were formed by rolling graphene layers into cylinders. They speculated that by rolling graphene layers into a cylinder, many different arrangements of graphene hexagonal nets are possible. They suggested two possibilities of such arrangements: circular arrangement (armchair nanotube) and a spiral, helical arrangement (chiral tube).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn256" id="fnref256"><sup>256</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1987, Howard G. Tennett of Hyperion Catalysis was issued a U.S. patent for the production of "cylindrical discrete carbon fibrils" with a "constant diameter between about 3.5 and about 70 nanometers..., length 10<sup>2</sup> times the diameter, and an outer region of multiple essentially continuous layers of ordered carbon atoms and a distinct inner core...."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn257" id="fnref257"><sup>257</sup></a></p>

<p>Iijima's discovery of multi-walled carbon nanotubes in the insoluble material of arc-burned graphite rods in 1991<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn258" id="fnref258"><sup>258</sup></a> and Mintmire, Dunlap, and White's independent prediction that if single-walled carbon nanotubes could be made, then they would exhibit remarkable conducting properties<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn259" id="fnref259"><sup>259</sup></a> helped create the initial buzz that is now associated with carbon nanotubes. Nanotube research accelerated greatly following the independent discoveries<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn260" id="fnref260"><sup>260</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn261" id="fnref261"><sup>261</sup></a> by Bethune at IBM and Iijima at NEC of <em>single-walled</em> carbon nanotubes and methods to specifically produce them by adding transition-metal catalysts to the carbon in an arc discharge. The arc discharge technique was well-known to produce the famed Buckminster fullerene on a preparative scale,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn262" id="fnref262"><sup>262</sup></a> and these results appeared to extend the run of accidental discoveries relating to fullerenes. The discovery of nanotubes remains a contentious issue. Many believe that Iijima's report in 1991 is of particular importance because it brought carbon nanotubes into the awareness of the scientific community as a whole.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn263" id="fnref263"><sup>263</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn264" id="fnref264"><sup>264</sup></a></p>
