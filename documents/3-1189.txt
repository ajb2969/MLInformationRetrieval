   555 timer IC      555 timer IC   The 555 timer IC is an integrated circuit (chip) used in a variety of timer , pulse generation, and oscillator applications. The 555 can be used to provide time delays, as an oscillator , and as a flip-flop element . Derivatives provide up to four timing circuits in one package.  Introduced in 1971 by American company Signetics , the 555 is still in widespread use due to its ease of use, low price, and stability. It is now made by many companies in the original bipolar and also in low-power CMOS types. , it was estimated that 1 billion units are manufactured every year. 1  Design    The IC was designed in 1971 by Hans Camenzind under contract to Signetics , which was later acquired by Dutch company Philips Semiconductors (now NXP ).  Depending on the manufacturer, the standard 555 package includes 25 transistors , 2 diodes and 15 resistors on a silicon chip installed in an 8-pin mini dual-in-line package ( DIP-8 ). 2 Variants available include the 556 (a 14-pin DIP combining two 555s on one chip), and the two 558 & 559s (both a 16-pin DIP combining four slightly modified 555s with DIS & THR connected internally, and TR is falling edge sensitive instead of level sensitive).  The NE555 parts were commercial temperature range, 0 °C to +70 °C, and the SE555 part number designated the military temperature range, −55 °C to +125 °C. These were available in both high-reliability metal can (T package) and inexpensive epoxy plastic (V package) packages. Thus the full part numbers were NE555V, NE555T, SE555V, and SE555T. It has been hypothesized that the 555 got its name from the three 5 kΩ resistors used within, 3 but Hans Camenzind has stated that the number was arbitrary. 4  Low-power versions of the 555 are also available, such as the 7555 and CMOS TLC555. 5 The 7555 is designed to cause less supply noise than the classic 555 and the manufacturer claims that it usually does not require a "control" capacitor and in many cases does not require a decoupling capacitor on the power supply. Those parts should generally be included, however, because noise produced by the timer or variation in power supply voltage might interfere with other parts of a circuit or influence its threshold voltages.  Pins  (Figure)  Pinout diagram   The connection of the pins for a DIP package is as follows:      Pin   Name   Purpose       1   GND   Ground reference voltage, low level (0 V)     2   TRIG   The OUT pin goes high and a timing interval starts when this input falls below 1/2 of CTRL voltage (which is typically 1/3 V CC , CTRL being 2/3 V CC by default if CTRL is left open).     3   OUT   This output is driven to approximately 1.7 V below + V CC , or to GND.     4        R  E  S  E  T   ¯     normal-¯    R  E  S  E  T     \overline{RESET}      A timing interval may be reset by driving this input to GND, but the timing does not begin again until RESET rises above approximately 0.7 volts. Overrides TRIG which overrides THR.     5   CTRL   Provides "control" access to the internal voltage divider (by default, 2/3 V CC ).     6   THR   The timing (OUT high) interval ends when the voltage at THR ("threshold") is greater than that at CTRL (2/3 V CC if CTRL is open).     7   DIS   Open collector output which may discharge a capacitor between intervals. In phase with output.     8   V CC   Positive supply voltage, which is usually between 3 and 15 V depending on the variation.     Pin 5 is also sometimes called the CONTROL VOLTAGE pin. By applying a voltage to the CONTROL VOLTAGE input one can alter the timing characteristics of the device. In most applications, the CONTROL VOLTAGE input is not used. It is usual to connect a 10 nF capacitor between pin 5 and 0 V to prevent interference. The CONTROL VOLTAGE input can be used to build an astable multivibrator with a frequency modulated output.  Modes  The IC 555 has three operating modes:   Bistable mode or Schmitt trigger – the 555 can operate as a flip-flop , if the DIS pin is not connected and no capacitor is used. Uses include bounce-free latched switches.  Monostable mode – in this mode, the 555 functions as a "one-shot" pulse generator. Applications include timers, missing pulse detection, bouncefree switches, touch switches, frequency divider, capacitance measurement, pulse-width modulation (PWM) and so on.  Astable (free-running) mode – the 555 can operate as an electronic oscillator . Uses include LED and lamp flashers, pulse generation, logic clocks, tone generation, security alarms, pulse position modulation and so on. The 555 can be used as a simple ADC , converting an analog value to a pulse length (e.g., selecting a thermistor as timing resistor allows the use of the 555 in a temperature sensor and the period of the output pulse is determined by the temperature). The use of a microprocessor-based circuit can then convert the pulse period to temperature, linearize it and even provide calibration means.   Bistable  In bistable (also called Schmitt trigger ) mode, the 555 timer acts as a basic flip-flop. The trigger and reset inputs (pins 2 and 4 respectively on a 555) are held high via pull-up resistors while the threshold input (pin 6) is simply floating. Thus configured, pulling the trigger momentarily to ground acts as a 'set' and transitions the output pin (pin 3) to Vcc (high state). Pulling the reset input to ground acts as a 'reset' and transitions the output pin to ground (low state). No timing capacitors are required in a bistable configuration. Pin 5 (control voltage) is connected to ground via a small-value capacitor (usually 0.01 to 0.1 μF). Pin 7 (discharge) is left floating. 6   Monostable  The output pulse ends when the voltage on the capacitor equals 2/3 of the supply voltage. The output pulse width can be lengthened or shortened to the need of the specific application by adjusting the values of R and C. 7  The output pulse width of time t , which is the time it takes to charge C to 2/3 of the supply voltage, is given by      t  =   R  C   ln   (  3  )     ≈   1.1  R  C         t    R  C    3           1.1  R  C      t=RC\ln(3)\approx 1.1RC     where t is in seconds, R is in ohms (resistance) and C is in farads (capacitance).  While using the timer IC in monostable mode, the main disadvantage is that the time span between any two triggering pulses must be greater than the RC time constant. 8   Astable  In astable mode, the 555 timer puts out a continuous stream of rectangular pulses having a specified frequency. Resistor R 1 is connected between V CC and the discharge pin (pin 7) and another resistor (R 2 ) is connected between the discharge pin (pin 7), and the trigger (pin 2) and threshold (pin 6) pins that share a common node. Hence the capacitor is charged through R 1 and R 2 , and discharged only through R 2 , since pin 7 has low impedance to ground during output low intervals of the cycle, therefore discharging the capacitor.  In the astable mode, the frequency of the pulse stream depends on the values of R 1 , R 2 and C:      f  =   1    ln   (  2  )    ⋅  C  ⋅   (    R  1   +   2   R  2     )         f    1   normal-⋅    2   C     subscript  R  1     2   subscript  R  2         f=\frac{1}{\ln(2)\cdot C\cdot(R_{1}+2R_{2})}    9  The high time from each pulse is given by:      high  =    ln   (  2  )    ⋅   (    R  1   +   R  2    )   ⋅  C       high   normal-⋅    2      subscript  R  1    subscript  R  2    C     \mathrm{high}=\ln(2)\cdot(R_{1}+R_{2})\cdot C     and the low time from each pulse is given by:      low  =    ln   (  2  )    ⋅   R  2   ⋅  C       low   normal-⋅    2    subscript  R  2   C     \mathrm{low}=\ln(2)\cdot R_{2}\cdot C     where R 1 and R 2 are the values of the resistors in ohms and C is the value of the capacitor in farads .  The power capability of R 1 must be greater than     V   c  c   2    R  1        superscript   subscript  V    c  c    2    subscript  R  1     \frac{V_{cc}^{2}}{R_{1}}   .  Particularly with bipolar 555s, low values of    R  1     subscript  R  1    R_{1}   must be avoided so that the output stays saturated near zero volts during discharge, as assumed by the above equation. Otherwise the output low time will be greater than calculated above. The first cycle will take appreciably longer than the calculated time, as the capacitor must charge from 0V to 2/3 of V CC from power-up, but only from 1/3 of V CC to 2/3 of V CC on subsequent cycles.  To have an output high time shorter than the low time (i.e., a duty cycle less than 50%) a small diode (that is fast enough for the application) can be placed in parallel with R 2 , with the cathode on the capacitor side. This bypasses R 2 during the high part of the cycle so that the high interval depends only on R 1 and C, with an adjustment based the voltage drop across the diode. The voltage drop across the diode slows charging on the capacitor so that the high time is a longer than the expected and often-cited ln(2)*R 1 C = 0.693 R 1 C. The low time will be the same as above, 0.693 R 1 C. With the bypass diode, the high time is      high  =     R  1   C   ⋅   ln   (     2   V  cc    -   3   V  diode       V  cc   -   3   V  diode      )         high   normal-⋅     subscript  R  1   C           2   subscript  V  cc      3   subscript  V  diode        subscript  V  cc     3   subscript  V  diode          \mathrm{high}=R_{1}C\cdot\ln\left(\frac{2V_{\textrm{cc}}-3V_{\textrm{diode}}}{%
 V_{\textrm{cc}}-3V_{\textrm{diode}}}\right)     where V diode is when the diode's "on" current is 1/2 of V cc /R 1 which can be determined from its datasheet or by testing. As an extreme example, when V cc = 5 and V diode = 0.7, high time = 1.00 R 1 C which is 45% longer than the "expected" 0.693 R 1 C. At the other extreme, when V cc = 15 and V diode = 0.3, the high time = 0.725 R 1 C which is closer to the expected 0.693 R 1 C. The equation reduces to the expected 0.693 R 1 C if V diode = 0.  The operation of RESET in this mode is not well defined, some manufacturers' parts will hold the output state to what it was when RESET is taken low, others will send the output either high or low.  The astable configuration, with two resistors, cannot produce a 50% duty cycle. To produce a 50% duty cycle, eliminate R1, disconnect pin 7 and connect the supply end of R2 to pin 3, the output pin. This circuit is similar to using an inverter gate as an oscillator, but with fewer components than the astable configuration, and a much higher power output than a TTL or CMOS gate. The duty cycle for either the 555 or inverter-gate timer will not be precisely 50% due to the fact the timing network is supplied from the devices output pin, which has different internal resistances depending on whether it is in the high or low state (high side drivers tend to be more resistive).  Specifications  These specifications apply to the NE555. Other 555 timers can have different specifications depending on the grade (military, medical, etc.).      Supply voltage ( V CC )   4.5 to 15 V     Supply current ( V CC = +5 V)   3 to 6 mA     Supply current ( V CC = +15 V)   10 to 15 mA     Output current (maximum)   200 mA     Maximum Power dissipation   600 mW     Power consumption (minimum operating)   30 mW@5V, 225 mW@15V     Operating temperature   0 to 70 °C     Derivatives  Many pin-compatible variants, including CMOS versions, have been built by various companies. Bigger packages also exist with two or four timers on the same chip. The 555 is also known under the following type numbers:      Manufacturer   Model   Remark       Custom Silicon Solutions 10   CSS555/CSS555C   CMOS from 1.2 V, IDD < 5 µA     CEMI   ULY7855      ECG Philips   ECG955M      Exar   XR-555      Fairchild Semiconductor   NE555/KA555      GoldStar   GSC555   CMOS     Harris   HA555      Hitachi   HA17555      IK Semicon   ILC555   CMOS from 2 V     Intersil   SE555/NE555      Intersil   ICM7555   CMOS     Lithic Systems   LC555      Maxim   ICM7555   CMOS from 2 V     Motorola   MC1455/MC1555      National Semiconductor   LM1455/LM555/LM555C      National Semiconductor   LMC555   CMOS from 1.5 V     NTE Sylvania   NTE955M      Raytheon   RM555/RC555      RCA   CA555/CA555C      STMicroelectronics   NE555N/ K3T647      STMicroelectronics   TS555   CMOS from 2 V     Texas Instruments   SN52555/SN72555      Texas Instruments   TLC555   CMOS from 2 V     USSR   К1006ВИ1      X-REL Semiconductor   XTR655   Operation from -60°C to 250+°C     Zetex   ZSCT1555 ( discontinued )   down to 0.9 V     NXP Semiconductors   ICM7555   CMOS     HFO / East Germany   B555      556 dual timer  The dual version is called 556. It features two complete 555s in a 14 pin DIL package.  558 quad timer  The quad version is called 558 and has 16 pins. To fit four 555s into a 16 pin package the power, control voltage, and reset lines are shared by all four modules. Each module's discharge and threshold circuits are wired together internally.  Example applications  Joystick interface circuit using the 558 quad timer  The Apple II  microcomputer used a quad timer 558 in monostable (or "one-shot") mode to interface up to four "game paddles" or two joysticks to the host computer. It also used a single 555 for flashing the display cursor.  A similar circuit was used in the IBM PC . 11 In the joystick interface circuit of the IBM PC, the capacitor of the RC network (see Monostable Mode above) was generally a 10 nF capacitor. The resistor of the RC network consisted of the potentiometer inside the joystick along with an external resistor of 2.2 kΩ. 12 The joystick potentiometer acted as a variable resistor. By moving the joystick, the resistance of the joystick increased from a small value up to about 100 kΩ. The joystick operated at 5 V. 13  Software running in the host computer started the process of determining the joystick position by writing to a special address (ISA bus I/O address 201h). 14 15 This would result in a trigger signal to the quad timer, which would cause the capacitor of the RC network to begin charging and cause the quad timer to output a pulse. The width of the pulse was determined by how long it took the C to charge up to 2/3 of 5 V (or about 3.33 V), which was in turn determined by the joystick position. 16 17 The software then measured the pulse width to determine the joystick position. A wide pulse represented the full-right joystick position, for example, while a narrow pulse represented the full-left joystick position. 18  See also   Counter  OpAmp  Oscillator  RC circuit   References  Further reading   555 Timer Applications Sourcebook Experiments ; H.
