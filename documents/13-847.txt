   Ranklet      Ranklet   In statistics , a ranklet is an orientation-selective non-parametric feature which is based on the computation of Mann–Whitney–Wilcoxon (MWW) rank-sum test statistics. Ranklets achieve similar response to Haar wavelets as they share the same pattern of orientation-selectivity, multi-scale nature and a suitable notion of completeness.  Rank-based (non-parametric) features have become popular in the field of image processing for their robustness in detecting outliers and invariance to monotonic transformations such as brightness, contrast changes and gamma correction .  The MWW is a combination of Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Mann–Whitney U-test. It is a non-parametric alternative to the t-test used to test the hypothesis for the comparison of two independent distributions. It assesses whether two samples of observations, usually referred as Treatment T and Control C , come from the same distribution but do not have to be normally distributed.  The Wilcoxon rank-sum statistics W s is determined as:       W  s   =    ∑   i  =  1   N     π  i    V  i   where   π  i     =   rank of element  i  and   V  i    =   {     0      for   π  i    ∈  C       1      for   π  i    ∈  T              subscript  W  s     subscript   superscript   N     i  1       subscript  π  i    subscript  V  i   where   subscript  π  i            rank of element  i  and   subscript  V  i          cases  0      for   subscript  π  i    C   1      for   subscript  π  i    T       W_{s}=\sum^{N}_{i=1}\pi_{i}V_{i}\text{ where }\pi_{i}=\text{rank of element }i%
 \text{ and }V_{i}=\begin{cases}0&\text{ for }\pi_{i}\in C\\
 1&\text{ for }\pi_{i}\in T\end{cases}     Subsequently, let MW be the Mann–Whitney statistics defined by:       M  W   =    W  s   -    m   (   m  +  1   )    2          M  W      subscript  W  s       m    m  1    2      MW=W_{s}-\frac{m(m+1)}{2}     where m is the number of Treatment values.  A ranklet R is defined as the normalization of MW in the range [−1, +1]:      R  =     M  W     m  n   /  2    -  1       R        M  W       m  n   2    1     R=\frac{MW}{mn/2}-1     where a positive value means that the Treatment region is brighter than the Control region, and a negative value otherwise.  Example  Suppose    T  =   {  5  ,  9  ,  1  ,  10  ,  15  }       T   5  9  1  10  15     T=\{5,9,1,10,15\}   and    C  =   {  20  ,  4  ,  7  ,  13  ,  19  ,  11  }       C   20  4  7  13  19  11     C=\{20,4,7,13,19,11\}   then       Intensity   1    4    5    7    9    10    11    13    15    19    20      Sample   T    C    T    C    T    T    C    C    T    C    C      Rank   1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8    9    10    11             W  s   =   {   1  +  3  +  5  +  6  +  9   }   =  24         subscript  W  s      1  3  5  6  9         24     W_{s}=\Big\{1+3+5+6+9\Big\}=24          M  W   =   24  -   [    5  ×   (   5  +  1   )    /  2   ]    =  9          M  W     24   delimited-[]      5    5  1    2          9     MW=24-[5\times(5+1)/2]=9         R  =    [   9  /   [    5  ×  6   /  2   ]    ]   -  1   =   -  0.4         R     delimited-[]    9   delimited-[]      5  6   2      1          0.4      R=[9/[5\times 6/2]]-1=-0.4      Hence, in the above example the Control region was a little bit brighter than the Treatment region.  Method  Since Ranklets are non-linear filters, they can only be applied in the spatial domain. Filtering with Ranklets involves dividing an image window W into Treatment and Control regions as shown in the image below:  (Figure)  Orientation-Selective Ranklets   Subsequently, Wilcoxon rank-sum test statistics are computed in order to determine the intensity variations among conveniently chosen regions (according to the required orientation) of the samples in W . The intensity values of both regions are then replaced by the respective ranking scores. These ranking scores determine a pairwise comparison between the T and C regions. This means that a ranklet essentially counts the number of T x C pairs which are brighter in the T set. Hence a positive value means that the Treatment values are brighter than the Control values, and vice versa.
