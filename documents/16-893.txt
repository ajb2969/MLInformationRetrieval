Revised simplex method

In mathematical optimization, the revised simplex method is a variant of George Dantzig's simplex method for linear programming.
The revised simplex method is mathematically equivalent to the standard simplex method but differs in implementation. Instead of maintaining a tableau which explicitly represents the constraints adjusted to a set of basic variables, it maintains a representation of a basis of the matrix representing the constraints. The matrix-oriented approach allows for greater computational efficiency by enabling sparse matrix operations.
Problem formulation
For the rest of the discussion, it is assumed that a linear programming problem has been converted into the following standard form:


 
  where . Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the constraint matrix 
 
 
 
  has full row rank and that the problem is feasible, i.e., there is at least one 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is rank-deficient, either there are redundant constraints, or the problem is infeasible. Both situations can be handled by a presolve step.
Algorithmic description
Optimality conditions
For linear programming, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are both necessary and sufficient for optimality. The KKT conditions of a linear programming problem in the standard form is



where 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. The last condition, which is equivalent to  0}} for all 
 
 

By what is sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of linear programming, a vertex 
 
 
 
 
  of the feasible polytope can be identified by be a basis 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  chosen from the latter's columns. Since 
 
 
 
  has full rank, 
 
 
 
  is nonsingular. Without loss of generality, assume that 
 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is given by



where . Partition 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  accordingly into



To satisfy the complementary slackness condition, let  0}}. It follows that



which implies that



If  at this point, the KKT conditions are satisfied, and thus 
 
 
 
  is optimal.
Pivot operation
If the KKT conditions are violated, a pivot operation consisting of introducing a column of 
 
 
 
  into the basis at the expense of an existing column in 
 
 
 
 
  is performed. In the absence of degeneracy, a pivot operation always results in a strict decrease in . Therefore, if the problem is bounded, the revised simplex method must terminate at an optimal vertex after repeated pivot operations because there are only a finite number of vertices.
Select an index 
 
 




i.e., every unit increase in  will results in a decrease by  in . Since


 must be correspondingly decreased by  B−1A'qxq}} subject to . Let  B−1A'q}}. If 
 
 
 
 
 , no matter how much  is increased,  will stay nonnegative. Hence,  can be arbitrarily decreased, and thus the problem is unbounded. Otherwise, select an index  argmin1≤i≤m {{(}}xi/di {{!}} di > 0{{)}}}} as the leaving index. This choice effectively increases  from zero until  is reduced to zero while maintaining feasibility. The pivot operation concludes with replacing  with  in the basis.
Numerical example
Consider a linear program where



Let



initially, which corresponds to a feasible vertex  [0 0 0 10 15]T}}. At this moment,



Choose 
 
 
 
  as the entering index. Then  [1 3]T}}, which means a unit increase in  will results in  and  being decreased by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. Therefore,  is increased to 
 
 
 
 
 , at which point  is reduced to zero, and 
 
 
 
 
  becomes the leaving index.
After the pivot operation,



Correspondingly,



A positive  indicates that 
 
 
 
 
  is now optimal.
Practical issues
Degeneracy
Because the revised simplex method is mathematically equivalent to the simplex method, it also suffers from degeneracy, where a pivot operation does not result in a decrease in , and a chain of pivot operations causes the basis to cycle. A perturbation or lexicographic strategy can be used to prevent cycling and guarantee termination.
Basis representation
Two types of linear systems involving 
 
 
 
  are present in the revised simplex method:
$$\begin{align}
 \boldsymbol{B z} & = \boldsymbol{y}, \\
 \boldsymbol{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{z} & = \boldsymbol{y}.
 \end{align}$$
Instead of refactorizing $\mathbf{ B } $, usually an LU factorization is directly updated after each pivot operation, for which purpose there exist several strategies such as the Forrest−Tomlin and Bartels−Golub methods. However, the amount of data representing the updates as well as numerical errors builds up over time and makes periodic refactorization necessary.
