   Revised simplex method      Revised simplex method   In mathematical optimization , the revised simplex method is a variant of George Dantzig 's simplex method for linear programming .  The revised simplex method is mathematically equivalent to the standard simplex method but differs in implementation. Instead of maintaining a tableau which explicitly represents the constraints adjusted to a set of basic variables, it maintains a representation of a basis of the matrix representing the constraints. The matrix-oriented approach allows for greater computational efficiency by enabling sparse matrix operations.  Problem formulation  For the rest of the discussion, it is assumed that a linear programming problem has been converted into the following standard form:        minimize      𝒄  T   𝒙       subject to       𝑨  𝒙   =  𝒃   ,   𝒙  ≥  𝟎          minimize     superscript  𝒄  normal-T   𝒙     subject to   formulae-sequence      𝑨  𝒙   𝒃     𝒙  0       \begin{array}[]{rl}\text{minimize}&\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}}\boldsymbol{x}\\
 \text{subject to}&\boldsymbol{Ax}=\boldsymbol{b},\boldsymbol{x}\geq\boldsymbol%
 {0}\end{array}   where . Without loss of generality, it is assumed that the constraint matrix   𝐀   𝐀   \mathbf{A}   has full row rank and that the problem is feasible, i.e., there is at least one    𝐱  ≥  𝟎      𝐱  normal-≥  0    \mathbf{x}≥\mathbf{0}   such that    𝐀𝐱  =  𝐛      𝐀𝐱  𝐛    \mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}   . If   𝐀   𝐀   \mathbf{A}   is rank-deficient, either there are redundant constraints, or the problem is infeasible. Both situations can be handled by a presolve step.  Algorithmic description  Optimality conditions  For linear programming, the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are both necessary and sufficient for optimality. The KKT conditions of a linear programming problem in the standard form is      𝑨  𝒙      𝑨  𝒙    \displaystyle\boldsymbol{Ax}     where   λ   λ   \mathbf{λ}   and   𝐬   𝐬   \mathbf{s}   are the Lagrange multipliers associated with the constraints    𝐀𝐱  =  𝐛      𝐀𝐱  𝐛    \mathbf{Ax}=\mathbf{b}   and    𝐱  ≥  𝟎      𝐱  normal-≥  0    \mathbf{x}≥\mathbf{0}   , respectively. The last condition, which is equivalent to 0}} for all   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}     By what is sometimes known as the fundamental theorem of linear programming , a vertex   𝐁   𝐁   \mathbf{B}   of the feasible polytope can be identified by be a basis   𝐀   𝐀   \mathbf{A}   of   𝐀   𝐀   \mathbf{A}   chosen from the latter's columns. Since   𝐁   𝐁   \mathbf{B}   has full rank,    𝐀  =   B  𝐁𝐍       𝐀    B  𝐁𝐍     \mathbf{A}=B\mathbf{B}\mathbf{N}   is nonsingular. Without loss of generality, assume that   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   . Then    𝒙  =   [      𝒙  𝑩        𝒙  𝑵      ]   =   [       𝑩   -  1    𝒃       𝟎     ]         𝒙     subscript  𝒙  𝑩      subscript  𝒙  𝑵               superscript  𝑩    1    𝒃     0       \boldsymbol{x}=\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{x_{B}}\\
 \boldsymbol{x_{N}}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}\boldsymbol{B}^{-1}\boldsymbol{%
 b}\\
 \boldsymbol{0}\end{bmatrix}   is given by     𝐜   𝐜   \mathbf{c}     where . Partition   𝐬   𝐬   \mathbf{s}   and   𝒄   𝒄   \displaystyle\boldsymbol{c}   accordingly into       𝑩  T   𝝀       superscript  𝑩  normal-T   𝝀    \displaystyle\boldsymbol{B}^{\mathrm{T}}\boldsymbol{\lambda}     To satisfy the complementary slackness condition, let  0 }} . It follows that     𝝀   𝝀   \displaystyle\boldsymbol{\lambda}     which implies that     𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}     If at this point, the KKT conditions are satisfied, and thus   𝐍   𝐍   \mathbf{N}   is optimal.  Pivot operation  If the KKT conditions are violated, a pivot operation consisting of introducing a column of   𝐁   𝐁   \mathbf{B}   into the basis at the expense of an existing column in   𝐀   𝐀   \mathbf{A}   is performed. In the absence of degeneracy , a pivot operation always results in a strict decrease in . Therefore, if the problem is bounded, the revised simplex method must terminate at an optimal vertex after repeated pivot operations because there are only a finite number of vertices.  Select an index       ∂   (    𝒄  T   𝒙   )     ∂   x  q     =   s  q    ,             superscript  𝒄  normal-T   𝒙       subscript  x  q      subscript  s  q     \frac{\partial(\boldsymbol{c}^{\mathrm{T}}\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_{q}}=s_{%
 q},         𝐝  ≤  𝟎      𝐝  normal-≤  0    \mathbf{d}≤\mathbf{0}     i.e., every unit increase in will results in a decrease by in . Since     𝒄   𝒄   \displaystyle\boldsymbol{c}    must be correspondingly decreased by  B −1 A ' q x q }} subject to . Let  B −1 A ' q }} . If   𝑩   𝑩   \displaystyle\boldsymbol{B}   , no matter how much is increased, will stay nonnegative. Hence, can be arbitrarily decreased, and thus the problem is unbounded. Otherwise, select an index argmin 1≤ i ≤ m {{(}} x i / d i {{!}} d i > 0{{)}}}} as the leaving index . This choice effectively increases from zero until is reduced to zero while maintaining feasibility. The pivot operation concludes with replacing with in the basis.  Numerical example  Consider a linear program where     𝝀   𝝀   \displaystyle\boldsymbol{\lambda}     Let      q  =  3      q  3    q=3     initially, which corresponds to a feasible vertex [0 0 0 10 15] T }} . At this moment,     1   1   1     Choose   3   3   3   as the entering index. Then [1 3] T }} , which means a unit increase in will results in and being decreased by   5   5   5   and    p  =  5      p  5    p=5   , respectively. Therefore, is increased to   𝑩   𝑩   \displaystyle\boldsymbol{B}   , at which point is reduced to zero, and   𝒙   𝒙   \displaystyle\boldsymbol{x}   becomes the leaving index.  After the pivot operation,     𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}     Correspondingly,     𝐁   𝐁   \mathbf{B}     A positive indicates that    𝑩  𝒛      𝑩  𝒛    \displaystyle\boldsymbol{Bz}   is now optimal.  Practical issues  Degeneracy  Because the revised simplex method is mathematically equivalent to the simplex method, it also suffers from degeneracy, where a pivot operation does not result in a decrease in , and a chain of pivot operations causes the basis to cycle. A perturbation or lexicographic strategy can be used to prevent cycling and guarantee termination.  Basis representation  Two types of linear systems involving   𝐁   𝐁   \mathbf{B}   are present in the revised simplex method:  $$\begin{align}
 \boldsymbol{B z} & = \boldsymbol{y}, \\
 \boldsymbol{B}^{\mathrm{T}} \boldsymbol{z} & = \boldsymbol{y}.
 \end{align}$$  Instead of refactorizing $\mathbf{ B } $ , usually an LU factorization is directly updated after each pivot operation, for which purpose there exist several strategies such as the Forrest−Tomlin and Bartels−Golub methods. However, the amount of data representing the updates as well as numerical errors builds up over time and makes periodic refactorization necessary.
