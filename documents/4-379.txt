Electroweak scale

In particle physics, the electroweak scale is the energy scale around 246 GeV, a typical energy of processes described by the electroweak theory. The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the vacuum expectation value

 
  of the Higgs field (where 
 
 
 
  is the Fermi coupling constant).
