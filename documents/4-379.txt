   Electroweak scale      Electroweak scale   In particle physics , the electroweak scale is the energy scale around 246 GeV , a typical energy of processes described by the electroweak theory . The particular number 246 GeV is taken to be the vacuum expectation value     v  =    (    G  F    2    )    -   1  /  2         v   superscript     subscript  G  F     2        1  2       v=(G_{F}\sqrt{2})^{-1/2}   of the Higgs field (where    G  F     subscript  G  F    G_{F}   is the Fermi coupling constant ).
