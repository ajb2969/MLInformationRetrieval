Linolenate 9R-lipoxygenase

Linolenate 9R-lipoxygenase (, NspLOX, (9R)-LOX, linoleate 9R-dioxygenase) is an enzyme with system name alpha-linolenate:oxygen (9R)-oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

alpha-linolenate + O2

 
  (9R,10E,12Z,15Z)-9-hydroperoxyoctadeca-10,12,15-trienoate
 

In cyanobacteria the enzyme is involved in oxylipin biosynthesis.
