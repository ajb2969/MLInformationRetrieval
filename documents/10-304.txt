Shilov boundary

In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Shilov boundary is the smallest closed subset of the structure space of a commutative Banach algebra where an analog of the maximum modulus principle holds. It is named after its discoverer, Georgii Evgen'evich Shilov.
Precise definition and existence
Let 
 
 
 
  be a commutative Banach algebra and let 
 
 
 
  be its structure space equipped with the relative weak*-topology of the dual

 
 . A closed (in this topology) subset 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is called a boundary of 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . The set 
 
 
 
 
  is called the Shilov boundary. It has been proved by Shilov1 that 
 
 
 
  is a boundary of 
 
 
 
 .
Thus one may also say that Shilov boundary is the unique set 
 
 
 
  which satisfies



 
  is a boundary of 
 
 
 
 
 , and
whenever 
 
 
 
  is a boundary of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .

Examples

Let 
 
 
 
  be the open unit disc in the complex plane and let



 
 
  be the disc algebra, i.e. the functions holomorphic in 
 
 
 
  and continuous in the closure of 
 
 
 
  with supremum norm and usual algebraic operations. Then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
