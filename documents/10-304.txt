   Shilov boundary      Shilov boundary   In functional analysis , a branch of mathematics, the Shilov boundary is the smallest closed subset of the structure space of a commutative  Banach algebra where an analog of the maximum modulus principle holds. It is named after its discoverer, Georgii Evgen'evich Shilov .  Precise definition and existence  Let   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   be a commutative  Banach algebra and let    Δ  𝒜      normal-Δ  𝒜    \Delta\mathcal{A}   be its structure space equipped with the relative  weak*-topology of the dual     𝒜  *     superscript  𝒜     {\mathcal{A}}^{*}   . A closed (in this topology) subset   F   F   F   of    Δ  𝒜      normal-Δ  𝒜    \Delta{\mathcal{A}}   is called a boundary of   𝒜   𝒜   {\mathcal{A}}   if      max   f  ∈   Δ  𝒜      |   x   (  f  )    |    =    max   f  ∈  F     |   x   (  f  )    |          subscript     f    normal-Δ  𝒜         x  f       subscript     f  F        x  f       \max_{f\in\Delta{\mathcal{A}}}|x(f)|=\max_{f\in F}|x(f)|   for all    x  ∈  𝒜      x  𝒜    x\in\mathcal{A}   . The set    S  =   ⋂   {  F  :   F  is a boundary of  𝒜   }        S     conditional-set  F    F  is a boundary of  𝒜       S=\bigcap\{F:F\text{ is a boundary of }{\mathcal{A}}\}   is called the Shilov boundary . It has been proved by Shilov 1 that   S   S   S   is a boundary of   𝒜   𝒜   {\mathcal{A}}   .  Thus one may also say that Shilov boundary is the unique set    S  ⊂   Δ  𝒜       S    normal-Δ  𝒜     S\subset\Delta\mathcal{A}   which satisfies      S   S   S   is a boundary of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   , and  whenever   F   F   F   is a boundary of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   , then    S  ⊂  F      S  F    S\subset F   .   Examples   Let    𝔻  =   {   z  ∈  ℂ   :    |  z  |   <  1   }       𝔻   conditional-set    z  ℂ       z   1      \mathbb{D}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}:|z|<1\}   be the open unit disc in the complex plane and let       𝒜  =    ℋ   (  𝔻  )    ∩   𝒞   (   𝔻  ¯   )         𝒜      ℋ  𝔻     𝒞   normal-¯  𝔻       {\mathcal{A}}={\mathcal{H}}(\mathbb{D})\cap{\mathcal{C}}(\bar{\mathbb{D}})   be the disc algebra , i.e. the functions holomorphic in   𝔻   𝔻   \mathbb{D}   and continuous in the closure of   𝔻   𝔻   \mathbb{D}   with supremum norm and usual algebraic operations. Then     Δ  𝒜   =   𝔻  ¯         normal-Δ  𝒜    normal-¯  𝔻     \Delta{\mathcal{A}}=\bar{\mathbb{D}}   and    S  =   {  |  z  |  =  1  }      fragments  S    fragments  normal-{  normal-|  z  normal-|   1  normal-}     S=\{|z|=1\}   .
