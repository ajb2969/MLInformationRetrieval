   Uroporphyrinogen-III C-methyltransferase      Uroporphyrinogen-III C-methyltransferase   Uroporphyrinogen-III C-methyltransferase (, uroporphyrinogen methyltransferase , uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase , adenosylmethionine-uroporphyrinogen III methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine-dependent uroporphyrinogen III methylase , uroporphyrinogen-III methylase , SirA , CysG , uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:uroporphyrin-III C-methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:uroporphyrinogen-III C-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   2 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uroporphyrinogen III   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-2 (overall reaction)  (1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uroporphyrinogen III   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-1  (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + precorrin-1   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + precorrin-2   Uroporphyrinogen-III C-methyltransferase catalyses two methylation reactions, the first forming precorrin-1 and the second leading to the formation of precorrin-2.
