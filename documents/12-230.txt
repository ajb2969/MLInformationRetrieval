Size function

Size functions are shape descriptors, in a geometrical/topological sense. They are functions from the half-plane 
 
 
 
  is defined in the following way. For every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is equal to the number of connected components of the set 
 
 
 
 
  that contain at least one point at which the measuring function (a continuous function from a topological space

 
  to 
 
 
1 2) 
 
 
 
  takes a value smaller than or equal to 
 
 
 
  .3 The concept of size function can be easily extended to the case of a measuring function 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is endowed with the usual partial order .4 A survey about size functions (and size theory) can be found in .5 
History and applications
Size functions were introduced in 6 for the particular case of 
 
 
 
  equal to the topological space of all piecewise 
 
 
 
  closed paths in a 
 
 
closed manifold embedded in a Euclidean space. Here the topology on 
 
 
 
 
  is induced by the 
 
 
 
 -norm, while the measuring function

 
  takes each path 
 
 
 
  to its length. In 7 the case of 
 
 
 
  equal to the topological space of all ordered 
 
 
 
 
 -tuples of points in a submanifold of a Euclidean space is considered. Here the topology on 
 
 
 
  is induced by the metric 
 
 
 
 .
An extension of the concept of size function to algebraic topology was made in 8 where the concept of size homotopy group was introduced. Here measuring functions taking values in 
 
 
 
  are allowed. An extension to homology theory (the size functor) was introduced in .9 The concepts of size homotopy group and size functor are strictly related to the concept of persistent homology group 10 studied in persistent homology. It is worth to point out that the size function is the rank of the 
 
 
 
 -th persistent homology group, while the relation between the persistent homology group and the size homotopy group is analogous to the one existing between homology groups and homotopy groups.
Size functions have been initially introduced as a mathematical tool for shape comparison in computer vision and pattern recognition, and have constituted the seed of size theory 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 .19 The main point is that size functions are invariant for every transformation preserving the measuring function. Hence, they can be adapted to many different applications, by simply changing the measuring function in order to get the wanted invariance. Moreover, size functions show properties of relative resistance to noise, depending on the fact that they distribute the information all over the half-plane 
 
 
 
 
 .
Main properties
Assume that 
 
 
 
  is a compact locally connected Hausdorff space. The following statements hold:
¤ every size function 
 
 
 
  is a non-decreasing function in the variable 
 
 
 
  and a non-increasing function in the variable 
 
 
 
 .
¤ every size function 
 
 
 
 
  is locally right-constant in both its variables.
¤ for every 
 
 
 
  is finite.
¤ for every 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
¤ for every 
 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
  equals the number of connected components of 
 
 
 
  on which the minimum value of 
 
 
 
  is smaller than or equal to 
 
 
 
 .
If we also assume that 
 
 
 
 
  is a smooth closed manifold and 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -function, the following useful property holds:
¤ in order that 
 
 
 
  is a discontinuity point for 
 
 
 
  it is necessary that either 
 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  or both are critical values for 
 
 
 
  .20
A strong link between the concept of size function and the concept of natural pseudodistance

 
  between the size pairs 
 
 
 
  exists 21 22
¤ if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 .
The previous result gives an easy way to get lower bounds for the natural pseudodistance and is one of the main motivation to introduce the concept of size function.
Representation by formal series
An algebraic representation of size functions in terms of collections of points and lines in the real plane with multiplicities, i.e. as particular formal series, was furnished in 23 24 .25 The points (called cornerpoints) and lines (called cornerlines) of such formal series encode the information about discontinuities of the corresponding size functions, while their multiplicities contain the information about the values taken by the size function.
Formally:

cornerpoints are defined as those points 
 
 
 
 , with 



 
  is positive. The number 
 
 
 
  is said to be the multiplicity of 
 
 
 
 .

cornerlines and are defined as those lines 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  The number $\mu (r)\$ is sad to be the '' multiplicity'' of $r\$.

Representation Theorem: For every ${\bar x}<{\bar y}$, it holds $\ell _{({M},\varphi )}({\bar x},{\bar y})=\sum _{p=(x,y)\atop x\le {\bar x}, y>\bar y }\mu\big(p\big)+\sum _{r:x=k\atop k\le {\bar x} }\mu\big(r\big)$

This representation contains the same amount of information about the shape under study as the original size function does, but is much more concise.
This algebraic approach to size functions leads to the definition of new similarity measures between shapes, by translating the problem of comparing size functions into the problem of comparing formal series. The most studied among these metrics between size function is the matching distance.26
