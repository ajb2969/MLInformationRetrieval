Carlactone synthase

Carlactone synthase (, CCD8 (gene), MAX4 (gene), NCED8 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 9-cis-10'-apo-beta-carotenal:O2 oxidoreductase (14,15-cleaving, carlactone-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

9-cis-10'-apo-beta-carotenal + 2 O2

carlactone + (2E,4E,6E)-7-hydroxy-4-methylhepta-2,4,6-trienal
 

Carlactone synthase contains Fe2+.
