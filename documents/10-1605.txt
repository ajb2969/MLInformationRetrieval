   5-(carboxyamino)imidazole ribonucleotide mutase      5-(carboxyamino)imidazole ribonucleotide mutase   In enzymology , a 5-(carboxyamino)imidazole ribonucleotide mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-carboxyamino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 5-carboxyamino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole , and one product , 5-amino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole-4-carboxylate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-carboxyamino-1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)imidazole carboxymutase . Other names in common use include N5-CAIR mutase , PurE , N5-carboxyaminoimidazole ribonucleotide mutase , and class I PurE .
