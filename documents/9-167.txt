   Groundwater discharge      Groundwater discharge   Groundwater discharge is the volumetric flow rate of groundwater through an aquifer .  Total groundwater discharge, as reported through a specified area, is similarly expressed as:      Q  =     d  h    d  l    K  A       Q        d  h     d  l    K  A     Q=\frac{dh}{dl}KA   where   Q is the total groundwater discharge ([L 3 ·T −1 ]; m 3 /s),  K is the hydraulic conductivity of the aquifer ([L·T −1 ]; m/s),  dh/dl is the hydraulic gradient ([L·L −1 ]; unitless), and  A is the area which the groundwater is flowing through ([L 2 ]; m 2 )   For example, this can be used to determine the flow rate of water flowing along a plane with known geometry.
