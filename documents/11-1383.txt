Undecaprenyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase

In enzymology, an undecaprenyl-phosphate mannosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

GDP-mannose + undecaprenyl phosphate 
 
 
 
  GDP + D-mannosyl-1-phosphoundecaprenol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-mannose and undecaprenyl phosphate, whereas its two products are GDP and D-mannosyl-1-phosphoundecaprenol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-mannose:undecaprenyl-phosphate D-mannosyltransferase. Other names in common use include guanosine diphosphomannose-undecaprenyl phosphate, mannosyltransferase, GDP mannose-undecaprenyl phosphate mannosyltransferase, and GDP-D-mannose:lipid phosphate transmannosylase. It employs one cofactor, phosphatidylglycerol. Sources of this enzyme includes Micrococcus luteus, Phaseolus aureus, Mycobacterium smegmatis and cotton fibers.
