   Biotin-independent malonate decarboxylase      Biotin-independent malonate decarboxylase   Biotin-independent malonate decarboxylase (, malonate decarboxylase (without biotin) , malonate decarboxylase , MDC ) is an enzyme with system name malonate carboxy-lyase (biotin-independent) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   malonate + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    acetate + CO 2    Two types of malonate decarboxylase are currently known, both of which form multienzyme complexes.
