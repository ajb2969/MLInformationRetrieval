   Lysine N-acetyltransferase      Lysine N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a lysine N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl phosphate + L-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphate + N 6 -acetyl-L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl phosphate and L-lysine , whereas its two products are phosphate and N6-acetyl-L-lysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-phosphate:L-lysine N6-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include lysine acetyltransferase , and acetyl-phosphate:L-lysine 6-N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in lysine degradation .
