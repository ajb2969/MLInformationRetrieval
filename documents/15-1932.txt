   Standard dimension ratio      Standard dimension ratio   Standard dimension ratio ( SDR ) is a method of rating a pipe's durability against pressure . The standard dimension ratio describes the correlation between the pipe dimension and the thickness of the pipe wall.  Common nominations are SDR11, SDR17 and SDR34. Pipes with a lower SDR can withstand higher pressures.
