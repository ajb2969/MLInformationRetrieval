   Parallel computation thesis      Parallel computation thesis   In computational complexity theory , the parallel computation thesis is a hypothesis which states that the time used by a (reasonable) parallel machine is polynomially related to the space used by a sequential machine. The parallel computation thesis was set forth by Chandra and Stockmeyer in 1976. 1  In other words, for a computational model which allows computations to branch and run in parallel without bound, a formal language which is decidable under the model using no more than    t   (  n  )       t  n    t(n)   steps for inputs of length n is decidable by a non-branching machine using no more than    t    (  n  )   k       t   superscript  n  k     t(n)^{k}   units of storage for some constant k . Similarly, if a machine in the unbranching model decides a language using no more than    s   (  n  )       s  n    s(n)   storage, a machine in the parallel model can decide the language in no more than    s    (  n  )   k       s   superscript  n  k     s(n)^{k}   steps for some constant k .  The parallel computation thesis is not a rigorous formal statement, as it does not clearly define what constitutes an acceptable parallel model. A parallel machine must be sufficiently powerful to emulate the sequential machine in time polynomially related to the sequential space; compare Turing machine , non-deterministic Turing machine , and alternating Turing machine . N. Blum (1983) introduced a model for which the thesis does not hold. 2 However, the model allows    2   2   O   (   T   (  n  )    )        superscript  2   superscript  2    O    T  n       2^{2^{O(T(n))}}   parallel threads of computation after    T   (  n  )       T  n    T(n)   steps. (See Big O notation .) Parberry (1986) suggested a more "reasonable" bound would be    2   O   (   T   (  n  )    )       superscript  2    O    T  n      2^{O(T(n))}   or    2   T    (  n  )    O   (  1  )         superscript  2    T   superscript  n    O  1       2^{T(n)^{O(1)}}   , in defense of the thesis. 3 Goldschlager (1982) proposed a model which is sufficiently universal to emulate all "reasonable" parallel models, which adheres to the thesis. 4 Chandra and Stockmeyer originally formalized and proved results related to the thesis for deterministic and alternating Turing machines, which is where the thesis originated. 5  References  "  Category:Parallel computing  Category:Theory of computation     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
