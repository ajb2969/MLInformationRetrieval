   Intermediate logic      Intermediate logic   In mathematical logic , a superintuitionistic logic is a propositional logic extending intuitionistic logic . Classical logic is the strongest consistent superintuitionistic logic; thus, consistent superintuitionistic logics are called intermediate logics (the logics are intermediate between intuitionistic logic and classical logic).  Definition  A superintuitionistic logic is a set L of propositional formulas in a countable set of variables p i satisfying the following properties:   1. all axioms of intuitionistic logic belong to L ;  2. if F and G are formulas such that F and F ‚Üí G both belong to L , then G also belongs to L (closure under modus ponens );  3. if F ( p 1 , p 2 , ..., p n ) is a formula of L , and G 1 , G 2 , ..., G n are any formulas, then F ( G 1 , G 2 , ..., G n ) belongs to L (closure under substitution).   Such a logic is intermediate if furthermore   4. L is not the set of all formulas.   Properties and examples  There exists a continuum of different intermediate logics. Specific intermediate logics are often constructed by adding one or more axioms to intuitionistic logic, or by a semantical description. Examples of intermediate logics include:   intuitionistic logic ( IPC , Int , IL , H )  classical logic ( CPC , Cl , CL ):  =  =  the logic of the weak excluded middle ( KC , Jankov 's logic, De Morgan logic Constructive Logic and the Medvedev Lattice,   Sebastiaan A.

Classical logic is the only coatom in the lattice of superintuitionistic logics; the lattice of intermediate logics also has a unique coatom, namely SmL .  The tools for studying intermediate logics are similar to those used for intuitionistic logic, such as Kripke semantics . For example, G√∂del‚ÄìDummett logic has a simple semantic characterization in terms of total orders .  Semantics  Given a Heyting algebra  H , the set of propositional formulas that are valid in H is an intermediate logic. Conversely, given an intermediate logic it is possible to construct its Lindenbaum algebra which is a Heyting algebra.  An intuitionistic Kripke frame  F is a partially ordered set , and a Kripke model M is a Kripke frame with valuation such that    {  x  ‚à£    M  ,  x   ‚ä©  p   }     conditional-set  x   forces   M  x   p     \{x\mid M,x\Vdash p\}   is an upper subset of F . The set of propositional formulas that are valid in F is an intermediate logic. Given an intermediate logic L it is possible to construct a Kripke model M such that the logic of M is L (this construction is called canonical model ). A Kripke frame with this property may not exist, but a general frame always does.  Relation to modal logics  Let A be a propositional formula. The G√∂del‚ÄìTarski translation of A is defined recursively as follows:        T   (   p  n   )    =   ‚ñ°   p  n          T   subscript  p  n      normal-‚ñ°   subscript  p  n      T(p_{n})=\Box p_{n}          T   (   ¬¨  A   )    =   ‚ñ°  ¬¨  T   (  A  )          T     A      normal-‚ñ°   T  A     T(\neg A)=\Box\neg T(A)          T   (   A  and  B   )    =   T   (  A  )   and  T   (  B  )          T    A  italic- and  B      T  A  italic- and  T  B     T(A\and B)=T(A)\and T(B)          T   (   A  ‚à®  B   )    =    T   (  A  )    ‚à®   T   (  B  )           T    A  B        T  A     T  B      T(A\vee B)=T(A)\vee T(B)         T   (  A  ‚Üí  B  )   =  ‚ñ°   (  T   (  A  )   ‚Üí  T   (  B  )   )      fragments  T   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-‚Üí  B  normal-)    ‚ñ°   fragments  normal-(  T   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)   normal-‚Üí  T   fragments  normal-(  B  normal-)   normal-)     T(A\to B)=\Box(T(A)\to T(B))      If M is a modal logic extending S4 then œÅ M = { A | T ( A ) ‚àà M } is a superintuitionistic logic, and M is called a modal companion of œÅ M . In particular:   IPC = œÅ S4  KC = œÅ S4.2  LC = œÅ S4.3  CPC = œÅ S5   For every intermediate logic L there are many modal logics M such that L = œÅ M .  References     Toshio Umezawa.
