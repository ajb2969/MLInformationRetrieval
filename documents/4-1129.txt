   70 Ophiuchi      70 Ophiuchi   70 Ophiuchi is a binary  star system located 16.6 light years away from the Earth . It is in the constellation  Ophiuchus . At magnitude 4 it appears as a dim star visible to the unaided eye away from city lights. 1  Binary star  The primary star is a yellow-orange main sequence dwarf BY Draconis variable 2 of spectral type K0, and the secondary star is an orange main sequence dwarf of spectral type K4. 3 The two stars orbit each other at an average distance of 23.2 AUs . But since the orbit is highly elliptical (at e=0.499), the separation between the two varies from 11.4 to 34.8 AUs, with one orbit taking 83.38 years to complete. 4  History  This star system was first cataloged by William Herschel in the late 18th century in his study of binary stars. Herschel proved that this system as a gravitationally bound binary system where the two stars orbited around a common center of mass . This was an important contribution to the proof that Newton's law of universal gravitation applied to objects beyond the solar system . He commented at the time that there was a possible third unseen companion affecting the orbit of the two visible stars. 5  Distance           Claims of a planetary system  In 1855, Capt. W. S. Jacob of the Madras Observatory of the East India Company claimed that the orbit of the binary showed an anomaly, and it was "highly probable" that there was a "planetary body in connection with this system". 6  T. J. J. See made a stronger claim for the existence of a dark companion in this system in 1899, 7 but Forest Ray Moulton soon published a paper proving that a three-body system with the specified orbital parameters would be highly unstable. 8 The claims by Jacob and See have both been shown to be erroneous. 9 Jacob's claim was probably one of the first for an exoplanet based on astrometric evidence. A claim of a planetary system was again made by Dirk Reuyl and Erik Holberg in 1943. The companion was estimated to have a mass one tenth the mass of the Sun . 10 This caused quite a sensation at the time but later observations have gradually discredited this claim. 11  Refining planetary boundaries  The negative results of past studies does not completely rule out the possibility of planets. In 2006 a McDonald Observatory team has set limits to the presence of one or more planets around 70 Ophiuchi with masses between 0.46 and 12.8 Jupiter masses and average separations spanning between 0.05 and 5.2 AU . 12  See also   Barnard's Star  List of the nearest stars  70 Ophiuchi in fiction   References  Notes  =5.5 and the absolute visual magnitude of the Sun     M   V  ⊙    =  4.83       subscript  M   subscript  V  direct-product    4.83    \scriptstyle M_{V_{\odot}}=4.83   , the visual luminosity can be calculated by       L   V  ∗     L   V  ⊙      =   10   0.4   (    M   V  ⊙    -   M   V  ∗     )            subscript  L   subscript  V  normal-∗     subscript  L   subscript  V  direct-product      superscript  10    0.4     subscript  M   subscript  V  direct-product     subscript  M   subscript  V  normal-∗         \scriptstyle\frac{L_{V_{\ast}}}{L_{V_{\odot}}}=10^{0.4\left(M_{V_{\odot}}-M_{V%
