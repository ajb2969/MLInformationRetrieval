Petersson inner product

In mathematics the Petersson inner product is an inner product defined on the space of entire modular forms. It was introduced by the German mathematician Hans Petersson.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be the space of entire modular forms of weight 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the space of cusp forms.
The mapping 
 
 
 
 ,



is called Petersson inner product, where



is a fundamental region of the modular group

 
  and for 
 
 




is the hyperbolic volume form.
Properties
The integral is absolutely convergent and the Petersson inner product is a positive definite Hermite form.
For the Hecke operators

 
 , and for forms 
 
 
 
  of level 
 
 
 
 , we have:



This can be used to show that the space of cusp forms of level 
 
 
 
  has an orthonormal basis consisting of simultaneous eigenfunctions for the Hecke operators and the Fourier coefficients of these forms are all real.
