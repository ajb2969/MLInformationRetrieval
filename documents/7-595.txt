   Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem      Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem   The Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem is a theorem in stochastic calculus stating the conditions under which a submartingale may be decomposed in a unique way as the sum of a martingale and an increasing  predictable process . It is named for Joseph L. Doob and Paul-André Meyer .  History  In 1953, Doob published the Doob decomposition theorem which gives a unique decomposition for certain discrete time martingales. 1 He conjectured a continuous time version of the theorem and in two publications in 1962 and 1963 Paul-André Meyer proved such a theorem, which became known as the Doob-Meyer decomposition. 2 3 In honor of Doob, Meyer used the term "class D" to refer to the class of supermartingales for which his unique decomposition theorem applied. 4  Class D Supermartingales  A càdlàg  submartingale    Z   Z   Z   is of Class D if     Z  0   =  0       subscript  Z  0   0    Z_{0}=0   and the collection      {   Z  T   ∣  T a finite valued stopping time  }     conditional-set   subscript  Z  T   T a finite valued stopping time    \{Z_{T}\mid\text{T a finite valued stopping time}\}   is uniformly integrable . 5  The theorem  Let   Z   Z   Z   be a cadlag submartingale of class D with     Z  0   =  0       subscript  Z  0   0    Z_{0}=0   . Then there exists a unique, increasing, predictable process    A   A   A   with     A  0   =  0       subscript  A  0   0    A_{0}=0   such that     M  t   =    Z  t   -   A  t         subscript  M  t      subscript  Z  t    subscript  A  t      M_{t}=Z_{t}-A_{t}   is a uniformly integrable martingale. 6  See also   Doob decomposition theorem   Notes  References        External links   The Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem with proof, by Jan van Neerven   "  Category:Martingale theory  Category:Statistical theorems  Category:Probability theorems     Doob 1953 ↩  Meyer 1952 ↩  Meyer 1963 ↩  Protter 2005 ↩  Protter (2005) ↩
