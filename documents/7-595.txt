Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem

The Doob–Meyer decomposition theorem is a theorem in stochastic calculus stating the conditions under which a submartingale may be decomposed in a unique way as the sum of a martingale and an increasing predictable process. It is named for Joseph L. Doob and Paul-André Meyer.
History
In 1953, Doob published the Doob decomposition theorem which gives a unique decomposition for certain discrete time martingales.1 He conjectured a continuous time version of the theorem and in two publications in 1962 and 1963 Paul-André Meyer proved such a theorem, which became known as the Doob-Meyer decomposition.23 In honor of Doob, Meyer used the term "class D" to refer to the class of supermartingales for which his unique decomposition theorem applied.4
Class D Supermartingales
A càdlàg submartingale

 
  is of Class D if 
 
 
 
  and the collection


 
  is uniformly integrable.5
The theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a cadlag submartingale of class D with 
 
 
 
 . Then there exists a unique, increasing, predictable process

 
  with 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a uniformly integrable martingale.6
