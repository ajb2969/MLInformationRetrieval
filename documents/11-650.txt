   2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(acetamidomethylene)succinate hydrolase      2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(acetamidomethylene)succinate hydrolase   In enzymology , a 2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(acetamidomethylene)succinate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(acetamidomethylene)succinate + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + 2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-oxobutanoate + NH 3 + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(acetamidomethylene)succinate and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are acetate , 2-(hydroxymethyl)-4-oxobutanoate , NH 3 , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-(hydroxymethyl)-3-(acetamidomethylene)succinate amidohydrolase (deaminating, decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include compound B hydrolase , alpha-hydroxymethyl-alpha'-(N-acetylaminomethylene)succinic acid , and hydrolase . This enzyme participates in vitamin B 6 metabolism .
