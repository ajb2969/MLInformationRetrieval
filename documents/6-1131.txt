   Shortest common supersequence problem      Shortest common supersequence problem   In computer science , the shortest common supersequence problem is a problem closely related to the longest common subsequence problem . Given two sequences X = 1,...,x m > and Y = 1,...,y n >, a sequence U = 1,...,u k > is a common supersequence of X and Y if U is a supersequence of both X and Y . In other words, a shortest common supersequence of strings x and y is a shortest string z such that both x and y are subsequences of z.  A shortest common supersequence (scs) is a common supersequence of minimal length. In the shortest common supersequence problem, the two sequences X and Y are given and the task is to find a shortest possible common supersequence of these sequences. In general, an scs is not unique.  For two input sequences, an scs can be formed from a longest common subsequence (lcs) easily. For example, if X      [   1..  m   ]   =   a  b  c  b  d  a  b        delimited-[]    1..  m      a  b  c  b  d  a  b     [1..m]=abcbdab   and Y      [   1..  n   ]   =   b  d  c  a  b  a        delimited-[]    1..  n      b  d  c  a  b  a     [1..n]=bdcaba   , the lcs is Z      [   1..  r   ]   =   b  c  b  a        delimited-[]    1..  r      b  c  b  a     [1..r]=bcba   . By inserting the non-lcs symbols while preserving the symbol order, we get the scs: U      [   1..  t   ]   =   a  b  d  c  a  b  d  a  b        delimited-[]    1..  t      a  b  d  c  a  b  d  a  b     [1..t]=abdcabdab   .  It is quite clear that     r  +  t   =   m  +  n         r  t     m  n     r+t=m+n   for two input sequences. However, for three or more input sequences this does not hold. Note also, that the lcs and the scs problems are not dual problems .  For the more general problem of finding a string, S which is a superstring of a set of strings S 1 , S 2 ,..., S l , the problem is NP-Complete . 1 Also, good approximations can be found for the average case but not for the worst case. 2 3  References      External links   Dictionary of Algorithms and Data Structures: shortest common supersequence   "  Category:Problems on strings  Category:Combinatorics  Category:Formal languages  Category:Dynamic programming     ↩  ↩  ↩
