Boyer–Lindquist coordinates

In the mathematical description of general relativity, the Boyer–Lindquist coordinates are a generalization of the coordinates used for the metric of a Schwarzschild black hole that can be used to express the metric of a Kerr black hole.
The coordinate transformation from Boyer–Lindquist coordinates 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  to cartesian coordinates x, y, z is given by














The line element for a black hole with mass 
 
 
 
 , angular momentum 
 
 
 
 , and charge 
 
 
 
  in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates and natural units (
 
 
 
 
 ) is








where










 
 , the angular momentum per unit mass of the black hole
 



Note that in natural units 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  all have units of length. This line element describes the Kerr–Newman metric.
The Hamiltonian for test particle motion in Kerr spacetime was separable in Boyer–Lindquist coordinates. Using Hamilton-Jacobi theory one can derive a fourth constant of the motion known as Carter's constant.1
