Gaisser–Hillas function

The Gaisser–Hillas function is used in astroparticle physics. It parameterizes the longitudinal particle density in a cosmic ray air shower. The function was proposed in 1977 by Thomas K. Gaisser and Anthony M. Hillas.1
The number of particles 
 
 
 
 
  as a function of traversed atmospheric depth 
 
 
 
  is expressed as



where 
 
 
 
  is maximum number of particles observed at depth 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are primary mass and energy dependent parameters.
Using substitutions


 
 ,  
 
 
 
   and  
 
 

the function can be written in an alternative one-parametric (m) form2 as
