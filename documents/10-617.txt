   Tartrate dehydrogenase      Tartrate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a tartrate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   tartrate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxaloglycolate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are tartrate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are oxaloglycolate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is tartrate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called mesotartrate dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , manganese .
