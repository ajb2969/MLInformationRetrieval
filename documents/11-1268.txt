   Glucomannan 4-beta-mannosyltransferase      Glucomannan 4-beta-mannosyltransferase   In enzymology , a glucomannan 4-beta-mannosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP-mannose + (glucomannan)n   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + (glucomannan)n + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-mannose and (glucomannan)n , whereas its two products are GDP and (glucomannan)n+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDPmannose:glucomannan 1,4-beta-D-mannosyltransferase . Other names in common use include GDP-man-beta-mannan manosyltransferase , and glucomannan-synthase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
