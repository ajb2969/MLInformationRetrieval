In probability theory, the inverse Gaussian distribution (also known as the Wald distribution) is a two-parameter family of continuous probability distributions with support on (0,∞).
Its probability density function is given by



for x > 0, where 
 
 
 
  is the mean and 
 
 
 
  is the shape parameter.
As λ tends to infinity, the inverse Gaussian distribution becomes more like a normal (Gaussian) distribution. The inverse Gaussian distribution has several properties analogous to a Gaussian distribution. The name can be misleading: it is an "inverse" only in that, while the Gaussian describes a Brownian Motion's level at a fixed time, the inverse Gaussian describes the distribution of the time a Brownian Motion with positive drift takes to reach a fixed positive level.
Its cumulant generating function (logarithm of the characteristic function) is the inverse of the cumulant generating function of a Gaussian random variable.
To indicate that a random variable X is inverse Gaussian-distributed with mean μ and shape parameter λ we write



Properties
Summation
If Xi has a IG(μ0wi, λ0wi2) distribution for i = 1, 2, ..., n and all Xi are independent, then



Note that



is constant for all i. This is a necessary condition for the summation. Otherwise S would not be inverse Gaussian.
Scaling
For any t > 0 it holds that



Exponential family
The inverse Gaussian distribution is a two-parameter exponential family with natural parameters -λ/(2μ²) and -λ/2, and natural statistics X and 1/X.
Differential equation



Relationship with Brownian motion
The stochastic process Xt given by






(where Wt is a standard Brownian motion and 
 
 
 
 ) is a Brownian motion with drift ν.
Then, the first passage time for a fixed level 
 
 
 
  by Xt is distributed according to an inverse-gaussian:



When drift is zero
A common special case of the above arises when the Brownian motion has no drift. In that case, parameter μ tends to infinity, and the first passage time for fixed level α has probability density function



This is a Lévy distribution with parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Maximum likelihood
The model where



with all wi known, (μ, λ) unknown and all Xi independent has the following likelihood function



Solving the likelihood equation yields the following maximum likelihood estimates



 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent and



Generating random variates from an inverse-Gaussian distribution
The following algorithm may be used.1
Generate a random variate from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and 1 standard deviation



Square the value



and use this relation



Generate another random variate, this time sampled from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1



If



then return


 
  else return

 public double inverseGaussian(double mu, double lambda) {

        double v = rand.nextGaussian();   // sample from a normal distribution with a mean of 0 and 1 standard deviation
        double y = v*v;
        double x = mu + (mu*mu*y)/(2*lambda) - (mu/(2*lambda)) * Math.sqrt(4*mu*lambda*y + mu*mu*y*y);
        double test = rand.nextDouble();  // sample from a uniform distribution between 0 and 1
        if (test <= (mu)/(mu + x))
               return x;
        else
               return (mu*mu)/x;

The convolution of a inverse Gaussian distribution (a Wald distribution) and an exponential (an ex-Wald distribution) is used as a model for response times in psychology,2 with visual search as one example.3
History
This distribution appears to have been first derived by Schrödinger in 1915 as the time to first passage of a Brownian motion.4 The name inverse Gaussian was proposed by Tweedie in 1945.5 Wald re-derived this distribution in 1947 as the limiting form of a sample in a sequential probability ratio test. Tweedie investigated this distribution in 1957 and established some of its statistical properties.
Software
The R programming language has software for this distribution.6 The inverse Gaussian distribution can be called using the statmod package.
