   Clifford's theorem on special divisors      Clifford's theorem on special divisors   In mathematics , Clifford's theorem on special divisors is a result of  on algebraic curves , showing the constraints on special linear systems on a curve C .  Statement  If D is a divisor on C , then D is (abstractly) a formal sum of points P on C (with integer coefficients), and in this application a set of constraints to be applied to functions on C (if C is a Riemann surface , these are meromorphic functions , and in general lie in the function field of C ). Functions in this sense have a divisor of zeros and poles, counted with multiplicity ; a divisor D is here of interest as a set of constraints on functions, insisting that poles at given points are only as bad as the positive coefficients in D indicate, and that zeros at points in D with a negative coefficient have at least that multiplicity. The dimension of the vector space   L ( D )   of such functions is finite, and denoted ℓ ( D ). Conventionally the linear system of divisors attached to D is then attributed dimension r ( D ) = ℓ ( D ) − 1, which is the dimension of the projective space parametrizing it.  The other significant invariant of D is its degree, d , which is the sum of all its coefficients.  A divisor is called special if ℓ ( K − D ) > 0, where K is the canonical divisor . 1  In this notation, Clifford's theorem is the statement that for an effective special divisor  D ,   ℓ ( D ) − 1 ≤ d /2,   together with the information that the case of equality here is only for D zero or canonical, or C a hyperelliptic curve and D linearly equivalent to an integral multiple of a hyperelliptic divisor.  The Clifford index of C is then defined as the minimum value of the d − 2 r ( D ), taken over all special divisors (that are not canonical or trivial). Clifford's theorem is then the statement that this is non-negative. The Clifford index for a generic curve of genus  g is the floor function of        g  -  1   2   .        g  1   2    \frac{g-1}{2}.     The Clifford index measures how far the curve is from being hyperelliptic. It may be thought of as a refinement of the gonality : in many cases the Clifford index is equal to the gonality minus 2. 2  Green's Conjecture  A conjecture of Mark Green states that the Clifford index for a curve over the complex numbers that is not hyperelliptic should be determined by the extent to which C as canonical curve has linear syzygies. In detail, the invariant a ( C ) is determined by the minimal free resolution of the homogeneous coordinate ring of C in its canonical embedding, as the largest index i for which the graded Betti number β i , i + 2 is zero. Green and Lazarsfeld showed that a ( C ) + 1 is a lower bound for the Clifford index, and Green's conjecture is that equality always holds. There are numerous partial results. 3  Claire Voisin was awarded the Ruth Lyttle Satter Prize in Mathematics for her solution of the generic case of Green's conjecture in two papers. 4 5 The case of Green's conjecture for generic curves had attracted a huge amount of effort by algebraic geometers over twenty years before finally being laid to rest by Voisin. 6 The conjecture for arbitrary curves remains open.
