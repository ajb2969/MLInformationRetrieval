   Washburn's equation      Washburn's equation  In [[physics]], '''Washburn's equation''' describes [[capillary action|capillary flow]] in a bundle of parallel cylindrical tubes; it is extended with some issues also to imbibition into porous materials. The equation is named after Edward Wight Washburn; 1 also known as Lucas–Washburn  equation , considering that Richard Lucas 2 wrote a similar paper three years earlier, or the Bell-Cameron-Lucas-Washburn  equation , considering J.M. Bell and F.K. Cameron's discovery of the form of the equation fifteen years earlier. 3  Derivation  In case of a fully wettable capillary, it is       L  2   =    γ  D  t    4  η         superscript  L  2       γ  D  t     4  η      L^{2}=\frac{\gamma Dt}{4\eta}     where   t   t   t   is the time for a liquid of dynamic viscosity    η   η   \eta   and surface tension    γ   γ   \gamma   to penetrate a distance   L   L   L   into the capillary whose pore diameter is   D   D   D   . In case of a porous materials many issues have been raised both about the physical meaning of the calculated pore diameter   D   D   D    4 and the real possibility to use this equation for the calculation of the contact angle of the solid. 5  The equation is derived for capillary flow in a cylindrical tube in the absence of a gravitational field , but according to physicist Len Fisher can be extremely accurate for more complex materials including biscuits (see dunk (biscuit) ). Following National biscuit dunking day , some newspaper articles quoted the equation as Fisher's equation .  In his paper from 1921 Washburn applies Poiseuille's Law for fluid motion in a circular tube. Inserting the expression for the differential volume in terms of the length   l   l   l   of fluid in the tube     d  V   =   π   r  2   d  l         d  V     π   superscript  r  2   d  l     dV=\pi r^{2}dl   , one obtains        δ  l    δ  t    =     ∑  P    8   r  2   η  l     (    r  4   +   4  ϵ   r  3     )            δ  l     δ  t          P     8   superscript  r  2   η  l       superscript  r  4     4  ϵ   superscript  r  3        \frac{\delta l}{\delta t}=\frac{\sum P}{8r^{2}\eta l}(r^{4}+4\epsilon r^{3})     where    ∑  P      P    \sum P   is the sum over the participating pressures, such as the atmospheric pressure    P  A     subscript  P  A    P_{A}   , the hydrostatic pressure    P  h     subscript  P  h    P_{h}   and the equivalent pressure due to capillary forces    P  c     subscript  P  c    P_{c}   .   η   η   \eta   is the viscosity of the liquid, and   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is the coefficient of slip, which is assumed to be 0 for wetting materials.   r   r   r   is the radius of the capillary. The pressures in turn can be written as       P  h   =    h  g  ρ   -   l  g  ρ   sin  ψ          subscript  P  h       h  g  ρ     l  g  ρ    ψ       P_{h}=hg\rho-lg\rho\sin\psi          P  c   =     2  γ   r    cos  ϕ         subscript  P  c         2  γ   r     ϕ      P_{c}=\frac{2\gamma}{r}\cos\phi     where   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of the liquid and   γ   γ   \gamma   its surface tension .   ψ   ψ   \psi   is the angle of the tube with respect to the horizontal axis.   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is the contact angle of the liquid on the capillary material. Substituting these expressions leads to the first-order differential equation for the distance the fluid penetrates into the tube   l   l   l   :        δ  l    δ  t    =     [    P  A   +   g  ρ   (   h  -   l   sin  ψ     )    +     2  γ   r    cos  ϕ     ]    (    r  4   +   4  ϵ   r  3     )     8   r  2   η  l            δ  l     δ  t         delimited-[]     subscript  P  A     g  ρ    h    l    ψ            2  γ   r     ϕ         superscript  r  4     4  ϵ   superscript  r  3        8   superscript  r  2   η  l      \frac{\delta l}{\delta t}=\frac{[P_{A}+g\rho(h-l\sin\psi)+\frac{2\gamma}{r}%
 \cos\phi](r^{4}+4\epsilon r^{3})}{8r^{2}\eta l}     Washburn's constant  The Washburn constant may be included in Washburn's equation.  It is calculated as follows:         10  4    [    μ  m   cm   ]    [   N   m  2    ]     68947.6   [   dynes   cm  2    ]     =   0.1450   (  38  )             superscript  10  4    delimited-[]      μ  normal-m   cm     delimited-[]    normal-N   superscript  normal-m  2        68947.6   delimited-[]    dynes   superscript  cm  2         0.1450  38     \frac{10^{4}\left[\mathrm{\frac{\mu m}{cm}}\right]\left[\mathrm{\frac{N}{m^{2}%
 }}\right]}{68947.6\left[\mathrm{\frac{dynes}{cm^{2}}}\right]}=0.1450(38)    6 7  Applications  Inkjet printing  The penetration of a liquid into the substrate flowing under its own capillary pressure can be calculated using a simplified version of Washburn's equation: 8 9      l  =     [    r   cos  θ    2   ]    1  2      [   γ  η   ]    1  2     t   1  2         l     superscript   delimited-[]      r    θ    2      1  2     superscript   delimited-[]    γ  η      1  2     superscript  t    1  2       l=\left[\frac{r\cos\theta}{2}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}\left[\frac{\gamma}{\eta}%
 \right]^{\frac{1}{2}}t^{\frac{1}{2}}   where the surface tension-to-viscosity ratio     [   γ  η   ]    1  2      superscript   delimited-[]    γ  η      1  2     \left[\tfrac{\gamma}{\eta}\right]^{\frac{1}{2}}   represents the speed of ink penetration into the substrate.
