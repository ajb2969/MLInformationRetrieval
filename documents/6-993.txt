Sphericity

 Sphericity is a measure of how spherical (round) an object is. As such, it is a specific example of a compactness measure of a shape. Defined by Wadell in 1935,1 the sphericity, 
 
 
 
 , of a particle is: the ratio of the surface area of a sphere (with the same volume as the given particle) to the surface area of the particle:



where 
 
 
 
  is volume of the particle and 
 
 
 
  is the surface area of the particle. The sphericity of a sphere is 1 and, by the isoperimetric inequality, any particle which is not a sphere will have sphericity less than 1.
Ellipsoidal objects
The sphericity, 
 
 
 
 , of an oblate spheroid (similar to the shape of the planet Earth) is:



where a and b are the semi-major and semi-minor axes respectively.
Derivation
Hakon Wadell defined sphericity as the surface area of a sphere of the same volume as the particle divided by the actual surface area of the particle.
First we need to write surface area of the sphere, 
 
 
 
  in terms of the volume of the particle, 
 
 




therefore



hence we define 
 
 
 
  as:
