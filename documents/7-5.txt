Spinor field

In differential geometry, given a spin structure on a n-dimensional Riemannian manifold (M, g) a section of the spinor bundle S is called a spinor field. The complex vector bundle


 
  is associated to the corresponding principal bundle


 
  of spin frames over M via the spin representation of its structure group Spin(n) on the space of spinors Δn.
Formal definition
Let (P, FP) be a spin structure on a Riemannian manifold (M, g) that is, an equivariant lift of the oriented orthonormal frame bundle

 
  with respect to the double covering 
 
 

One usually defines the spinor bundle1

 
  to be the complex vector bundle



associated to the spin structure P via the spin representation

 
  where U(W) denotes the group of unitary operators acting on a Hilbert space W.
A spinor field is defined to be a section of the spinor bundle S, i.e., a smooth mapping 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is the identity mapping idM of M.
