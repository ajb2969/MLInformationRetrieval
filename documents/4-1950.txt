   Path (topology)      Path (topology)   (Figure)  The points traced by a path from A to B in R ². However, different paths can trace the same set of points.   In mathematics , a path in a topological space  X is a continuous function  f from the unit interval  I = [0,1] to X   f : I → X .   The initial point of the path is f (0) and the terminal point is f (1). One often speaks of a "path from x to y " where x and y are the initial and terminal points of the path. Note that a path is not just a subset of X which "looks like" a curve , it also includes a parameterization . For example, the maps f ( x ) = x and g ( x ) = x 2 represent two different paths from 0 to 1 on the real line.  A loop in a space X based at x ∈ X is a path from x to x . A loop may be equally well regarded as a map f : I → X with f (0) = f (1) or as a continuous map from the unit circle  S 1 to X   f : S 1 → X .   This is because S 1 may be regarded as a quotient of I under the identification 0 ∼ 1. The set of all loops in X forms a space called the loop space of X .  A topological space for which there exists a path connecting any two points is said to be path-connected . Any space may be broken up into a set of path-connected components . The set of path-connected components of a space X is often denoted π 0 ( X );.  One can also define paths and loops in pointed spaces , which are important in homotopy theory . If X is a topological space with basepoint x 0 , then a path in X is one whose initial point is x 0 . Likewise, a loop in X is one that is based at x 0 .  Homotopy of paths  Paths and loops are central subjects of study in the branch of algebraic topology called homotopy theory . A homotopy of paths makes precise the notion of continuously deforming a path while keeping its endpoints fixed.  Specifically, a homotopy of paths, or path-homotopy , in X is a family of paths f t : I → X indexed by I such that   f t (0) = x 0 and f t (1) = x 1 are fixed.  the map F : I × I → X given by F ( s , t ) = f t ( s ) is continuous.   The paths f 0 and f 1 connected by a homotopy are said to homotopic (or more precisely path-homotopic , to distinguish between the relation defined on all continuous functions between fixed spaces). One can likewise define a homotopy of loops keeping the base point fixed.  The relation of being homotopic is an equivalence relation on paths in a topological space. The equivalence class of a path f under this relation is called the homotopy class of f , often denoted [ f ].  Path composition  One can compose paths in a topological space in an obvious manner. Suppose f is a path from x to y and g is a path from y to z . The path fg is defined as the path obtained by first traversing f and then traversing g :       f  g   (  s  )    =   {      f   (   2  s   )       0  ≤  s  ≤    1  2          g   (    2  s   -  1   )         1  2    ≤  s  ≤  1.             f  g  s    cases    f    2  s        0  s         1  2       g      2  s   1          1  2   s       1.       fg(s)=\begin{cases}f(2s)&0\leq s\leq\frac{1}{2}\\
 g(2s-1)&\frac{1}{2}\leq s\leq 1.\end{cases}   Clearly path composition is only defined when the terminal point of f coincides with the initial point of g . If one considers all loops based at a point x 0 , then path composition is a binary operation .  Path composition, whenever defined, is not associative due to the difference in parametrization. However it is associative up to path-homotopy. That is, [( fg ) h ] = [ f ( gh )]. Path composition defines a group structure on the set of homotopy classes of loops based at a point x 0 in X . The resultant group is called the fundamental group of X based at x 0 , usually denoted π 1 ( X , x 0 ).  In situations calling for associativity of path composition "on the nose," a path in X may instead be defined as a continuous map from an interval [0, a ] to X for any real a ≥ 0. A path f of this kind has a length | f | defined as a . Path composition is then defined as before with the following modification:       f  g   (  s  )    =   {      f   (  s  )       0  ≤  s  ≤   |  f  |         g   (   s  -   |  f  |    )        |  f  |   ≤  s  ≤    |  f  |   +   |  g  |               f  g  s    cases    f  s       0  s         f       g    s    f           f   s           f     g         fg(s)=\begin{cases}f(s)&0\leq s\leq|f|\\
 g(s-|f|)&|f|\leq s\leq|f|+|g|\end{cases}   Whereas with the previous definition, f , g , and fg all have length 1 (the length of the domain of the map), this definition makes | fg | = | f | + | g |. What made associativity fail for the previous definition is that although ( fg ) h and f ( gh ) have the same length, namely 1, the midpoint of ( fg ) h occurred between g and h , whereas the midpoint of f ( gh ) occurred between f and g . With this modified definition ( fg ) h and f ( gh ) have the same length, namely | f |+| g |+| h |, and the same midpoint, found at (| f |+| g |+| h |)/2 in both ( fg ) h and f ( gh ); more generally they have the same parametrization throughout.  Fundamental groupoid  There is a categorical picture of paths which is sometimes useful. Any topological space X gives rise to a category where the objects are the points of X and the morphisms are the homotopy classes of paths. Since any morphism in this category is an isomorphism this category is a groupoid , called the fundamental groupoid of X . Loops in this category are the endomorphisms (all of which are actually automorphisms ). The automorphism group of a point x 0 in X is just the fundamental group based at X . More generally, one can define the fundamental groupoid on any subset A of X , using homotopy classes of paths joining points of A . This is convenient for the Van Kampen's Theorem .
