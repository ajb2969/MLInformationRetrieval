   Cartesian product of graphs      Cartesian product of graphs   In graph theory , the Cartesian product  G    □   normal-□   \square    H of graphs G and H is a graph such that   the vertex set of G    □   normal-□   \square    H is the Cartesian product  V(G) × V(H) ; and  any two vertices (u,u') and (v,v') are adjacent in G    □   normal-□   \square    H if and only if either  u = v and ''u' '' is adjacent with ''v' '' in H , or  ''u' '' = ''v' '' and u is adjacent with v in G .    Cartesian product graphs can be recognized efficiently, in time O( m log n ) for a graph with m edges and n vertices. The operation is commutative as an operation on isomorphism  classes of graphs, and more strongly the graphs G    □   normal-□   \square    H and H    □   normal-□   \square    G are naturally isomorphic , but it is not commutative as an operation on labeled graphs. The operation is also associative , as the graphs ( F    □   normal-□   \square    G )   □   normal-□   \square    H and F    □   normal-□   \square   ( G    □   normal-□   \square    H ) are naturally isomorphic.  The notation G × H is occasionally also used for Cartesian products of graphs, but is more commonly used for another construction known as the tensor product of graphs . The square symbol is the more common and unambiguous notation for the Cartesian product of graphs. It shows visually the four edges resulting from the Cartesian product of two edges.  Examples   The Cartesian product of two edges is a cycle on four vertices: K 2    □   normal-□   \square   K 2 = C 4 .  The Cartesian product of K 2 and a path graph is a ladder graph .  The Cartesian product of two path graphs is a grid graph .  The Cartesian product of n edges is a hypercube:            (   K  2   )    □  n    =   Q  n    .       superscript   subscript  K  2     normal-□  n     subscript  Q  n     (K_{2})^{\square n}=Q_{n}.       Thus, the Cartesian product of two hypercube graphs is another hypercube: Q i    □   normal-□   \square   Q j = Q i+j .    The Cartesian product of two median graphs is another median graph.  The graph of vertices and edges of an n- prism is the Cartesian product graph K 2    □   normal-□   \square   C n .  The rook's graph is the Cartesian product of two complete graphs.   Properties  If a connected graph is a Cartesian product, it can be factorized uniquely as a product of prime factors, graphs that cannot themselves be decomposed as products of graphs. 1 However,  describe a disconnected graph that can be expressed in two different ways as a Cartesian product of prime graphs:   (K 1 + K 2 + K 2 2 )   □   normal-□   \square   (K 1 + K 2 3 ) = (K 1 + K 2 2 + K 2 4 )   □   normal-□   \square   (K 1 + K 2 ),   where the plus sign denotes disjoint union and the superscripts denote exponentiation over Cartesian products.  A Cartesian product is vertex transitive if and only if each of its factors is. 2  A Cartesian product is bipartite if and only if each of its factors is. More generally, the chromatic number of the Cartesian product satisfies the equation   χ(G   □   normal-□   \square   H) = max {χ(G), χ(H)}. The Hedetniemi conjecture states a related equality for the tensor product of graphs . The independence number of a Cartesian product is not so easily calculated, but as  showed it satisfies the inequalities  α( G )α( H ) + min{|V( G )|-α( G ),|V( H )|-α( H )} ≤ α( G    □   normal-□   \square    H ) ≤ min{α( G ) |V( H )|, α( H ) |V( G )|}.   The Vizing conjecture states that the domination number of a Cartesian product satisfies the inequality   γ( G    □   normal-□   \square    H ) ≥ γ( G )γ( H ).   Algebraic graph theory  Algebraic graph theory can be used to analyse the Cartesian graph product. If the graph    G  1     subscript  G  1    G_{1}   has    n  1     subscript  n  1    n_{1}   vertices and the     n  1   ×   n  1        subscript  n  1    subscript  n  1     n_{1}\times n_{1}   adjacency matrix    𝐀  1     subscript  𝐀  1    \mathbf{A}_{1}   , and the graph    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   has    n  2     subscript  n  2    n_{2}   vertices and the     n  2   ×   n  2        subscript  n  2    subscript  n  2     n_{2}\times n_{2}   adjacency matrix    𝐀  2     subscript  𝐀  2    \mathbf{A}_{2}   , then the adjacency matrix of the Cartesian product of both graphs is given by       𝐀   1  □  2    =     𝐀  1   ⊗   𝐈   n  2     +    𝐈   n  1    ⊗   𝐀  2          subscript  𝐀    1  normal-□  2       tensor-product   subscript  𝐀  1    subscript  𝐈   subscript  n  2      tensor-product   subscript  𝐈   subscript  n  1     subscript  𝐀  2       \mathbf{A}_{1\square 2}=\mathbf{A}_{1}\otimes\mathbf{I}_{n_{2}}+\mathbf{I}_{n_%

History  According to , Cartesian products of graphs were defined in 1912 by Whitehead and Russell . They were repeatedly rediscovered later, notably by .
