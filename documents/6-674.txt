   Reflection group      Reflection group   In group theory and geometry , a reflection group is a discrete group which is generated by a set of reflections of a finite-dimensional Euclidean space . The symmetry group of a regular polytope or of a tiling of the Euclidean space by congruent copies of a regular polytope is necessarily a reflection group. Reflection groups also include Weyl groups and crystallographic Coxeter groups . While the orthogonal group is generated by reflections (by the Cartan–Dieudonné theorem ), it is a continuous group (indeed, Lie group ), not a discrete group, and is generally considered separately.  Definition  Let E be a finite-dimensional Euclidean space . A finite reflection group is a subgroup of the general linear group of E which is generated by a set of orthogonal reflections across hyperplanes passing through the origin. An affine reflection group is a discrete subgroup of the affine group of E that is generated by a set of affine reflections of E (without the requirement that the reflection hyperplanes pass through the origin).  The corresponding notions can be defined over other fields , leading to complex reflection groups and analogues of reflection groups over a finite field .  Examples  Plane  In two dimensions, the finite reflection groups are the dihedral groups , which are generated by reflection in two lines that form an angle of     2  π   /  n        2  π   n    2\pi/n   and correspond to the Coxeter diagram       I  2    (  n  )    .       subscript  I  2   n    I_{2}(n).   Conversely, the cyclic point groups in two dimensions are not generated by reflections, and indeed contain no reflections – they are however subgroups of index 2 of a dihedral group.  Infinite reflection groups include the frieze groups      *   ∞  ∞       absent         *\infty\infty   and     *   22  ∞       absent    22      *22\infty   and the wallpaper groups     *  *         **   ,     *  2222      absent  2222    *2222   ,     *  333      absent  333    *333   ,     *  442      absent  442    *442   and     *  632      absent  632    *632   . If the angle between two lines is an irrational multiple of pi, the group generated by reflections in these lines is infinite and non-discrete, hence, it is not a reflection group.  Space  Finite reflection groups are the point groups  C nv , D nh , and the symmetry groups of the five Platonic solids . Dual regular polyhedra (cube and octahedron, as well as dodecahedron and icosahedron) give rise to isomorphic symmetry groups. The classification of finite reflection groups of R 3 is an instance of the ADE classification .  Kaleidoscopes  Reflection groups have deep relations with kaleidoscopes , as discussed in .  Relation with Coxeter groups  A reflection group W admits a presentation of a special kind discovered and studied by H.S.M. Coxeter . The reflections in the faces of a fixed fundamental "chamber" are generators r i of W of order 2. All relations between them formally follow from the relations        (    r  i    r  j    )    c   i  j     =  1       superscript     subscript  r  i    subscript  r  j     subscript  c    i  j     1    (r_{i}r_{j})^{c_{ij}}=1     expressing the fact that the product of the reflections r i and r j in two hyperplanes H i and H j meeting at an angle    π  /   c   i  j        π   subscript  c    i  j      \pi/c_{ij}   is a rotation by the angle     2  π   /   c   i  j          2  π    subscript  c    i  j      2\pi/c_{ij}   fixing the subspace H i ∩ H j of codimension 2. Thus, viewed as an abstract group, every reflection group is a Coxeter group .  Finite fields  When working over finite fields, one defines a "reflection" as a map that fixes a hyperplane (otherwise for example there would be no reflections in characteristic 2, as     -  1   =  1        1   1    -1=1   so reflections are the identity). Geometrically, this amounts to including shears in a hyperplane. Reflection groups over finite fields of characteristic not 2 were classified in .  Generalizations  Discrete isometry groups of more general Riemannian manifolds generated by reflections have also been considered. The most important class arises from Riemannian symmetric spaces of rank 1: the n-sphere  S n , corresponding to finite reflection groups, the Euclidean space R n , corresponding to affine reflection groups, and the hyperbolic space  H n , where the corresponding groups are called hyperbolic reflection groups . In two dimensions, triangle groups include reflection groups of all three kinds.
