Phosphoramidate—hexose phosphotransferase




Phosphoramidate—hexose phosphotransferase

In enzymology, a phosphoramidate-hexose phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phosphoramidate + hexose 
 
 
 
  NH3 + alpha-D-hexose 1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphoramidate and hexose, whereas its two products are NH3 and alpha-D-hexose 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoramidate:hexose 1-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include phosphoramidate-hexose transphosphorylase, and phosphoramidic-hexose transphosphorylase.
