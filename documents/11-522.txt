N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphatase




N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphatase

In enzymology, a N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acylneuraminate 9-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  N-acylneuraminate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acylneuraminate 9-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are N-acylneuraminate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acylneuraminate-9-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include acylneuraminate 9-phosphatase, N-acylneuraminic acid 9-phosphate phosphatase, and N-acylneuraminic (sialic) acid 9-phosphatase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
