   Xylonate dehydratase      Xylonate dehydratase   In enzymology , a xylonate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-xylonate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-xylonate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-xylonate , and two products , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-xylonate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-xylonate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-xylonate-forming) . Other names in common use include D-xylo-aldonate dehydratase , D-xylonate dehydratase , and D-xylonate hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .
