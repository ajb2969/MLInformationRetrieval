Degree matrix

In the mathematical field of graph theory the degree matrix is a diagonal matrix which contains information about the degree of each vertex—that is, the number of edges attached to each vertex.1 It is used together with the adjacency matrix to construct the Laplacian matrix of a graph.2
Definition
Given a graph 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  the degree matrix

 
  for 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
diagonal matrix defined as3



where the degree 
 
 
 
  of a vertex counts the number of times an edge terminates at that vertex. In an undirected graph, this means that each new loop increases the degree of a vertex by two. In a directed graph, the term degree may refer either to indegree (the number of incoming edges at each vertex) or outdegree (the number of outgoing edges at each vertex).
