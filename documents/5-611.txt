   Degree matrix      Degree matrix   In the mathematical field of graph theory the degree matrix is a diagonal matrix which contains information about the degree of each vertex —that is, the number of edges attached to each vertex. 1 It is used together with the adjacency matrix to construct the Laplacian matrix of a graph. 2  Definition  Given a graph    G  =   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G=(V,E)   with     |  V  |   =  n        V   n    |V|=n   the degree matrix    D   D   D   for   G   G   G   is a    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n    diagonal matrix defined as 3       d   i  ,  j    :=   {      deg   (   v  i   )         if   i   =  j       0    otherwise         fragments   subscript  d   i  j    assign   fragments  normal-{     degree   subscript  v  i        if  i   j     0  otherwise       d_{i,j}:=\left\{\begin{matrix}\deg(v_{i})&\mbox{if}\ i=j\\
 0&\mbox{otherwise}\end{matrix}\right.     where the degree    deg   (   v  i   )      degree   subscript  v  i     \deg(v_{i})   of a vertex counts the number of times an edge terminates at that vertex. In an undirected graph , this means that each new loop increases the degree of a vertex by two. In a directed graph , the term degree may refer either to indegree (the number of incoming edges at each vertex) or outdegree (the number of outgoing edges at each vertex).
