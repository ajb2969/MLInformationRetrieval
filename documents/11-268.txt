   Bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (asymmetrical)      Bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (asymmetrical)   In enzymology , a bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphatase (asymmetrical) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   P 1 ,P 4 -bis(5'-guanosyl) tetraphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GTP + GMP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are P1,P4-bis(5'-guanosyl) tetraphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are GTP and GMP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is P1,P4-bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphate nucleotidohydrolase . Other names in common use include bis(5'-guanosyl)-tetraphosphatase , bis(5'-adenosyl)-tetraphosphatase , diguanosinetetraphosphatase (asymmetrical) , dinucleosidetetraphosphatase (asymmetrical) , diadenosine P1,P4-tetraphosphatase , dinucleoside tetraphosphatase , and 1-P,4-P-bis(5'-nucleosyl)-tetraphosphate nucleotidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and pyrimidine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
