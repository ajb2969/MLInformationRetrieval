   Lebesgue's lemma      Lebesgue's lemma   For Lebesgue's lemma for open covers of compact spaces in topology see Lebesgue's number lemma  In mathematics , Lebesgue's lemma is an important statement in approximation theory . It provides a bound for the projection error.  Statement  Let ( V , ||·||) be a normed vector space , U be a subspace of V and let   P   P   P   be a linear projector on   U   U   U   . Then, for each v in V :        ∥   v  -   P  v    ∥   ≤    (   1  +   ∥  P  ∥    )     inf   u  ∈  U     ∥   v  -  u   ∥      .       norm    v    P  v         1   norm  P      subscript  infimum    u  U     norm    v  u        \|v-Pv\|\leq(1+\|P\|)\inf_{u\in U}\|v-u\|.
