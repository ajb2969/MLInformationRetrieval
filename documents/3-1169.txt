   Low-discrepancy sequence      Low-discrepancy sequence   In mathematics , a low-discrepancy sequence is a sequence with the property that for all values of N , its subsequence x 1 , ..., x N has a low discrepancy .  Roughly speaking, the discrepancy of a sequence is low if the proportion of points in the sequence falling into an arbitrary set B is close to proportional to the measure of B , as would happen on average (but not for particular samples) in the case of an equidistributed sequence . Specific definitions of discrepancy differ regarding the choice of B ( hyperspheres , hypercubes, etc.) and how the discrepancy for every B is computed (usually normalized) and combined (usually by taking the worst value).  Low-discrepancy sequences are also called quasi-random or sub-random sequences, due to their common use as a replacement of uniformly distributed random numbers . The "quasi" modifier is used to denote more clearly that the values of a low-discrepancy sequence are neither random nor pseudorandom, but such sequences share some properties of random variables and in certain applications such as the quasi-Monte Carlo method their lower discrepancy is an important advantage.  Applications  (Figure)  Error in estimated kurtosis as a function of number of datapoints. 'Additive subrandom' gives the maximum error when c =¬†(‚àö5¬†‚àí¬†1)/2. 'Random' gives the average error over six runs of random numbers, where the average is taken to reduce the magnitude of the wild fluctuations   Subrandom numbers have an advantage over pure random numbers in that they cover the domain of interest quickly and evenly. They have an advantage over purely deterministic methods in that deterministic methods only give high accuracy when the number of datapoints is pre-set whereas in using subrandom numbers the accuracy improves continually as more datapoints are added.  Two useful applications are in finding the characteristic function of a probability density function , and in finding the derivative function of a deterministic function with a small amount of noise. Subrandom numbers allow higher-order moments to be calculated to high accuracy very quickly.  Applications that don't involve sorting would be in finding the mean , standard deviation , skewness and kurtosis of a statistical distribution, and in finding the integral and global maxima and minima of difficult deterministic functions. Subrandom numbers can also be used for providing starting points for deterministic algorithms that only work locally, such as Newton‚ÄìRaphson iteration .  Subrandom numbers can also be combined with search algorithms. A binary tree Quicksort -style algorithm ought to work exceptionally well because subrandom numbers flatten the tree far better than random numbers, and the flatter the tree the faster the sorting. With a search algorithm, subrandom numbers can be used to find the mode , median , confidence intervals and cumulative distribution of a statistical distribution, and all local minima and all solutions of deterministic functions.  Low-discrepancy sequences in numerical integration  At least three methods of numerical integration can be phrased as follows. Given a set { x 1 , ..., x N } in the interval [0,1], approximate the integral of a function f as the average of the function evaluated at those points:         ‚à´  0  1    f   (  u  )   d  u    ‚âà     1  N      ‚àë   i  =  1   N    f   (   x  i   )       .        superscript   subscript   0   1     f  u  d  u        1  N     superscript   subscript     i  1    N     f   subscript  x  i        \int_{0}^{1}f(u)\,du\approx\frac{1}{N}\,\sum_{i=1}^{N}f(x_{i}).     If the points are chosen as x i = i / N , this is the rectangle rule . If the points are chosen to be randomly (or pseudorandomly ) distributed, this is the Monte Carlo method . If the points are chosen as elements of a low-discrepancy sequence, this is the quasi-Monte Carlo method . A remarkable result, the Koksma‚ÄìHlawka inequality (stated below), shows that the error of such a method can be bounded by the product of two terms, one of which depends only on f , and the other one is the discrepancy of the set { x 1 , ..., x N }.  It is convenient to construct the set { x 1 , ..., x N } in such a way that if a set with N +1 elements is constructed, the previous N elements need not be recomputed. The rectangle rule uses points set which have low discrepancy, but in general the elements must be recomputed if N is increased. Elements need not be recomputed in the Monte Carlo method if N is increased, but the point sets do not have minimal discrepancy. By using low-discrepancy sequences, the quasi-Monte Carlo method has the desirable features of the other two methods.  Definition of discrepancy  The discrepancy of a set P = { x 1 , ..., x N } is defined, using Niederreiter's notation, as        D  N    (  P  )    =    sup   B  ‚àà  J     |     A   (  B  ;  P  )    N   -    Œª  s    (  B  )     |           subscript  D  N   P     subscript  supremum    B  J            A   B  P    N      subscript  Œª  s   B        D_{N}(P)=\sup_{B\in J}\left|\frac{A(B;P)}{N}-\lambda_{s}(B)\right|     where Œª s is the s -dimensional Lebesgue measure , A ( B ; P ) is the number of points in P that fall into B , and J is the set of s -dimensional intervals or boxes of the form        ‚àè   i  =  1   s    [   a  i   ,   b  i   )    =   {   ùê±  ‚àà   ùêë  s    :    a  i   ‚â§   x  i   <   b  i    }         superscript   subscript  product    i  1    s     subscript  a  i    subscript  b  i      conditional-set    ùê±   superscript  ùêë  s         subscript  a  i    subscript  x  i         subscript  b  i        \prod_{i=1}^{s}[a_{i},b_{i})=\{\mathbf{x}\in\mathbf{R}^{s}:a_{i}\leq x_{i}     where    0  ‚â§   a  i   <   b  i   ‚â§  1        0   subscript  a  i         subscript  b  i        1     0\leq a_{i}   .  The star-discrepancy  D * N ( P ) is defined similarly, except that the supremum is taken over the set J * of rectangular boxes of the form       ‚àè   i  =  1   s    [  0  ,   u  i   )       superscript   subscript  product    i  1    s    0   subscript  u  i      \prod_{i=1}^{s}[0,u_{i})     where u i is in the half-open interval [0, 1).

The Koksma - Hlawka inequality is sharp in the following sense: For any point set { x 1 ,..., x N } in I s and any    œµ  >  0      œµ  0    \epsilon>0   , there is a function f with bounded variation and V(f)=1 such that        |     1  N     ‚àë   i  =  1   N    f   (   x  i   )      -    ‚à´    I  ¬Ø   s     f   (  u  )   d  u     |   >     D  N  *    (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  N   )    -  œµ    .              1  N     superscript   subscript     i  1    N     f   subscript  x  i        subscript    superscript   normal-¬Ø  I   s      f  u  d  u           superscript   subscript  D  N       subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  N     œµ     \left|\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^{N}f(x_{i})-\int_{\bar{I}^{s}}f(u)\,du\right|>D_{N%

Construction of low-discrepancy sequences  Because any distribution of random numbers can be mapped onto a uniform distribution, and subrandom numbers are mapped in the same way, this article only concerns generation of subrandom numbers on a multidimensional uniform distribution.  There are constructions of sequences known such that         D  N  *    (   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  N   )    ‚â§   C     (   ln  N   )   s   N     .         superscript   subscript  D  N       subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  N       C     superscript    N   s   N      D_{N}^{*}(x_{1},\ldots,x_{N})\leq C\frac{(\ln N)^{s}}{N}.   where C is a certain constant, depending on the sequence. After Conjecture 2, these sequences are believed to have the best possible order of convergence. Examples below are the van der Corput sequence , the Halton sequences , and the Sobol sequences .  Random numbers  Sequences of subrandom numbers can be generated from random numbers by imposing a negative correlation on those random numbers. One way to do this is to start with a set of random numbers    r  i     subscript  r  i    r_{i}   on    [  0  ,  0.5  )     0  0.5    [0,0.5)   and construct subrandom numbers    s  i     subscript  s  i    s_{i}   which are uniform on    [  0  ,  1  )     0  1    [0,1)   using:       s  i   =   r  i        subscript  s  i    subscript  r  i     s_{i}=r_{i}   for   i   i   i   odd and     s  i   =   0.5  +   r  i         subscript  s  i     0.5   subscript  r  i      s_{i}=0.5+r_{i}   for   i   i   i   even.  A second way to do it with the starting random numbers is to construct a random walk with offset 0.5 as in:        s  i   =     s   i  -  1    +  0.5  +   r  i       (   mod  1   )     .       subscript  s  i    annotated     subscript  s    i  1    0.5   subscript  r  i     pmod  1      s_{i}=s_{i-1}+0.5+r_{i}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}1).\,     That is, take the previous subrandom number, add 0.5 and the random number, and take the result modulo 1.  For more than one dimension, Latin squares of the appropriate dimension can be used to provide offsets to ensure that the whole domain is covered evenly.  (Figure)  Coverage of the unit square.

Additive recurrence  For any irrational   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   , the sequence       s  n   =   {    s  0   +   n  Œ±    }        subscript  s  n       subscript  s  0     n  Œ±       s_{n}=\{s_{0}+n\alpha\}     has discrepancy tending to 0. (Note the sequence can be defined recursively by     s   n  +  1    =    (    s  n   +  Œ±   )   mod  1        subscript  s    n  1     modulo     subscript  s  n   Œ±   1     s_{n+1}=(s_{n}+\alpha)\bmod\,1   .) A good value of   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   gives lower discrepancy than a sequence of independent uniform random numbers.  The discrepancy can be bounded by the approximation exponent of   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   . If the approximation exponent is   Œº   Œº   \mu   , then for any    œµ  >  0      œµ  0    \epsilon>0   , the following bound holds: 1         D  N    (   (   s  n   )   )    =    O  œµ    (   N    -   1  /   (   Œº  -  1   )     +  œµ    )     .         subscript  D  N    subscript  s  n       subscript  O  œµ    superscript  N        1    Œº  1     œµ       D_{N}((s_{n}))=O_{\epsilon}(N^{-1/(\mu-1)+\epsilon}).     By the Thue-Siegel-Roth theorem , the approximation exponent of any irrational algebraic number is 2, giving a bound of    N    -  1   +  œµ      superscript  N      1   œµ     N^{-1+\epsilon}   above.  The value of   c   c   c   with lowest discrepancy is 2      c  =     5   -  1   2   ‚âà  0.618034.        c        5   1   2        0.618034.     c=\frac{\sqrt{5}-1}{2}\approx 0.618034.     Another value that is nearly as good is:      c  =    2   -  1   ‚âà   0.414214.         c      2   1        0.414214.     c=\sqrt{2}-1\approx 0.414214.\,     In more than one dimension, separate subrandom numbers are needed for each dimension. In higher dimensions, one set of values that can be used is the square roots of primes from two up, all taken modulo 1:      c  =    2   ,   3   ,   5   ,   7   ,   11   ,   ‚Ä¶        c     2     3     5     7     11   normal-‚Ä¶     c=\sqrt{2},\sqrt{3},\sqrt{5},\sqrt{7},\sqrt{11},\ldots\,     The recurrence relation above is similar to the recurrence relation used by a Linear congruential generator , a poor-quality pseudorandom number generator: 3       r  i   =  mod   (  a   r   i  -  1    +  c  ,  m  )      fragments   subscript  r  i    modulo   fragments  normal-(  a   subscript  r    i  1     c  normal-,  m  normal-)     r_{i}=\bmod(ar_{i-1}+c,m)     For the low discrepancy additive recurrence above, a and m are chosen to be 1. Note, however, that this will not generate independent random numbers, so should not be used for purposes requiring independence. The list of pseudorandom number generators lists methods for generating independent pseudorandom numbers.  Sobol sequence  The Antonov‚ÄìSaleev variant of the Sobol sequence generates numbers between zero and one directly as binary fractions of length   w   w   w   , from a set of   w   w   w   special binary fractions,       V  i   ,  i   =  1   ,   2  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  w      formulae-sequence      subscript  V  i   i   1    2  normal-‚Ä¶  w     V_{i},i=1,2,\dots,w   called direction numbers. The bits of the Gray code of   i   i   i   ,    G   (  i  )       G  i    G(i)   , are used to select direction numbers. To get the Sobol sequence value    s  i     subscript  s  i    s_{i}   take the exclusive or of the binary value of the Gray code of   i   i   i   with the appropriate direction number. The number of dimensions required affects the choice of    V  i     subscript  V  i    V_{i}   .  van der Corput sequence  Let      n  =    ‚àë   k  =  0    L  -  1      d  k    (  n  )    b  k         n    superscript   subscript     k  0      L  1       subscript  d  k   n   superscript  b  k       n=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_{k}(n)b^{k}     be the b -ary representation of the positive integer n ‚â• 1, i.e. 0 ‚â§ d k ( n )  g_b(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^{-k-1}.  Then there is a constant C depending only on b such that ( g b ( n )) n ‚â• 1 satisfies         D  N  *    (    g  b    (  1  )    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,    g  b    (  N  )    )    ‚â§   C    log  N   N     ,         subscript   superscript  D    N       subscript  g  b   1   normal-‚Ä¶     subscript  g  b   N       C      N   N      D^{*}_{N}(g_{b}(1),\dots,g_{b}(N))\leq C\frac{\log N}{N},     where D * N is the star discrepancy .  Halton sequence    The Halton sequence is a natural generalization of the van der Corput sequence to higher dimensions. Let s be an arbitrary dimension and b 1 , ..., b s be arbitrary coprime integers greater than 1. Define        x   (  n  )    =   (    g   b  1     (  n  )    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,    g   b  s     (  n  )    )    .        x  n       subscript  g   subscript  b  1    n   normal-‚Ä¶     subscript  g   subscript  b  s    n      x(n)=(g_{b_{1}}(n),\dots,g_{b_{s}}(n)).     Then there is a constant C depending only on b 1 , ..., b s , such that sequence { x ( n )} n ‚â•1 is a s -dimensional sequence with         D  N  *    (   x   (  1  )    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x   (  N  )    )    ‚â§    C  ‚Ä≤      (   log  N   )   s   N     .         subscript   superscript  D    N      x  1   normal-‚Ä¶    x  N        superscript  C  normal-‚Ä≤      superscript    N   s   N      D^{*}_{N}(x(1),\dots,x(N))\leq C^{\prime}\frac{(\log N)^{s}}{N}.     Hammersley set  Let b 1 ,..., b s-1 be coprime positive integers greater than 1. For given s and N , the s -dimensional Hammersley set of size N is defined by 4       x   (  n  )    =   (    g   b  1     (  n  )    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,    g   b   s  -  1      (  n  )    ,   n  N   )         x  n       subscript  g   subscript  b  1    n   normal-‚Ä¶     subscript  g   subscript  b    s  1     n     n  N      x(n)=(g_{b_{1}}(n),\dots,g_{b_{s-1}}(n),\frac{n}{N})     for n = 1, ..., N . Then        D  N  *    (   x   (  1  )    ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x   (  N  )    )    ‚â§   C     (   log  N   )    s  -  1    N           subscript   superscript  D    N      x  1   normal-‚Ä¶    x  N       C     superscript    N     s  1    N      D^{*}_{N}(x(1),\dots,x(N))\leq C\frac{(\log N)^{s-1}}{N}     where C is a constant depending only on b 1 , ..., b s ‚àí1 .  Poisson disk sampling  Poisson disk sampling is popular in video games to rapidly placing objects in a way that appears random-looking but guarantees that every two points are separated by at least the specified minimum distance. 5  Graphical examples  The points plotted below are the first 100, 1000, and 10000 elements in a sequence of the Sobol' type. For comparison, 10000 elements of a sequence of pseudorandom points are also shown. The low-discrepancy sequence was generated by TOMS algorithm 659. 6 An implementation of the algorithm in Fortran is available from Netlib .
