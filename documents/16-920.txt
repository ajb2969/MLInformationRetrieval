   Semi-invariant of a quiver      Semi-invariant of a quiver   In mathematics, given a quiver Q with set of vertices Q 0 and set of arrows Q 1 , a representation of Q assigns a vector space V i to each vertex and a linear map V ( α ): V ( s ( α )) → V ( t ( α )) to each arrow α , where s ( α ), t ( α ) are, respectively, the starting and the ending vertices of α. Given an element d ∈ ℕ Q 0 , the set of representations of Q with dim V i = d (i) for each i has a vector space structure.  It is naturally endowed with an action of the algebraic group ∏ i∈ Q 0 GL( d ( i )) by simultaneous base change. Such action induces one on the ring of functions. The ones which are invariants up to a character of the group are called semi-invariants . They form a ring whose structure reflects representation-theoretical properties of the quiver .  Definitions  Let Q = (Q 0 ,Q 1 , s , t ) be a quiver . Consider a dimension vector d , that is an element in ℕ Q 0 . The set of d -dimensional representations is given by       Rep   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    :=   {   V  ∈   Rep   (  Q  )     :    V  i   =   𝐝   (  i  )     }      assign   Rep  Q  𝐝    conditional-set    V   Rep  Q       subscript  V  i     𝐝  i       \operatorname{Rep}(Q,\mathbf{d}):=\{V\in\operatorname{Rep}(Q):V_{i}=\mathbf{d}%

 {\mathbf{d}(t(\alpha))})     Such affine variety is endowed with an action of the algebraic group GL( d ) := ∏ i ∈ Q 0 GL( d ( i )) by simultaneous base change on each vertex:          G  L   (  𝐝  )    ×   Rep   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )       ⟶     Rep   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )         (   (   g  i   )   ,   (   V  i   ,   V   (  α  )    )   )     ⟼     (   V  i   ,      g   t   (  α  )     ⋅  V    (  α  )    ⋅   g   s   (  α  )     -  1     )             G  L  𝐝    Rep  Q  𝐝    normal-⟶   Rep  Q  𝐝       subscript  g  i     subscript  V  i     V  α     normal-⟼    subscript  V  i    normal-⋅     normal-⋅   subscript  g    t  α    V   α    superscript   subscript  g    s  α      1         \begin{array}[]{ccc}GL(\mathbf{d})\times\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\mathbf{d})&%

We have an induces action on the coordinate ring k [Rep(Q, d )] by defining:           G  L   (  𝐝  )    ×  k    [   Rep   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    ]      ⟶     k  Rep   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )   ]        (  g  ,  f  )     ⟼     g  ⋅  f   (  -  )   :=  f   (   g   -  1    .  -  )                G  L  𝐝   k    delimited-[]   Rep  Q  𝐝     normal-⟶   fragments  k  Rep   fragments  normal-(  Q  normal-,  d  normal-)   normal-]      g  f   normal-⟼   fragments  g  normal-⋅  f   fragments  normal-(   normal-)   assign  f   fragments  normal-(   superscript  g    1    normal-.   normal-)       \begin{array}[]{ccc}GL(\mathbf{d})\times k[\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\mathbf{d})]&%

The set of invariants       I   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    :=   k    [   Rep   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    ]    G  L   (  𝐝  )         assign    I   Q  𝐝      k   superscript   delimited-[]   Rep  Q  𝐝      G  L  𝐝       I(Q,\mathbf{d}):=k[\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\mathbf{d})]^{GL(\mathbf{d})}     is in general a subalgebra of k [Rep(Q, d )].  Example  Consider the 1-loop quiver Q:  (Figure)  1-loop quiver   For d = ( n ) the representation space is End( k n ) and the action of GL( n ) is given by usual conjugation. The invariant ring is       I   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    =   k   [   c  1   ,  …  ,   c  n   ]          I   Q  𝐝      k    subscript  c  1   normal-…   subscript  c  n       I(Q,\mathbf{d})=k[c_{1},\ldots,c_{n}]     where the c i s are defined, for any A ∈ End( k n ), as the coefficients of the characteristic polynomial       det   (   A  -   t  𝕀    )    =     t  n   -    c  1    (  A  )    t   n  -  1      +  ⋯  +     (   -  1   )   n    c  n    (  A  )             A    t  𝕀          superscript  t  n      subscript  c  1   A   superscript  t    n  1      normal-⋯     superscript    1   n    subscript  c  n   A      \det(A-t\mathbb{I})=t^{n}-c_{1}(A)t^{n-1}+\cdots+(-1)^{n}c_{n}(A)     Semi-invariants  In case Q has neither loops nor cycles the variety k [Rep(Q, d )] has a unique closed orbit corresponding to the unique d -dimensional semi-simple representation, therefore any invariant function is constant.  Elements which are invariants with respect to the subgroup SL( d ) := ∏ { i ∈ Q 0 } SL( d ( i )) form a ring, SI(Q, d ), with a richer structure called ring of semi-invariants. It decomposes as       S  I   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    =    ⊕   σ  ∈   ℤ   Q  0       S  I    (  Q  ,  𝐝  )   σ           S  I   Q  𝐝      subscript  direct-sum    σ   superscript  ℤ   subscript  Q  0        S  I   subscript   Q  𝐝   σ       SI(Q,\mathbf{d})=\bigoplus_{\sigma\in\mathbb{Z}^{Q_{0}}}SI(Q,\mathbf{d})_{\sigma}     where        S  I    (  Q  ,  𝐝  )   σ    :=   {   f  ∈   k   [   Rep   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    ]     :     g  ⋅  f   =    ∏   i  ∈   Q  0      det     (   g  i   )    σ  i    f      ,    ∀  g   ∈   G  L   (  𝐝  )      }    .     assign    S  I   subscript   Q  𝐝   σ     conditional-set    f    k   delimited-[]   Rep  Q  𝐝       formulae-sequence     normal-⋅  g  f     subscript  product    i   subscript  Q  0          superscript   subscript  g  i    subscript  σ  i    f         for-all  g     G  L  𝐝        SI(Q,\mathbf{d})_{\sigma}:=\{f\in k[\operatorname{Rep}(Q,\mathbf{d})]:g\cdot f%
 =\prod_{i\in Q_{0}}\det(g_{i})^{\sigma_{i}}f,\forall g\in GL(\mathbf{d})\}.     A function belonging to SI(Q, d ) σ is called semi-invariant of weight σ .  Example  Consider the quiver Q:      1   →  𝛼   2      α  normal-→   1  2    1\xrightarrow{\ \ \alpha\ }2     Fix d = ( n , n ). In this case k [Rep( Q ,( n , n ))] is congruent to the set of square matrices of size n : M ( n ). The function defined, for any B ∈ M ( n ), as det u ( B ( α )) is a semi-invariant of weight ( u ,− u ) in fact        (   g  1   ,   g  2   )   ⋅    det  u    (  B  )     =    det  u    (    g  2   -  1    B   g  1    )    =    det  u     (   g  1   )     det   -  u      (   g  2   )     det  u    (  B  )               normal-⋅    subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2      superscript   u   B      superscript   u      superscript   subscript  g  2     1    B   subscript  g  1            superscript   u      subscript  g  1     superscript     u       subscript  g  2     superscript   u   B          (g_{1},g_{2})\cdot{\det}^{u}(B)={\det}^{u}(g_{2}^{-1}Bg_{1})={\det}^{u}(g_{1})%
 {\det}^{-u}(g_{2}){\det}^{u}(B)     The ring of semi-invariants equals the polynomial ring generated by det, i.e.       𝖲𝖨   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    =   k   [  det  ]          𝖲𝖨   Q  𝐝      k   delimited-[]       \mathsf{SI}(Q,\mathbf{d})=k[\det]     Characterization of representation type through semi-invariant theory  For quivers of finite representation-type, that is to say Dynkin quivers , the vector space k [Rep(Q, d )] admits an open dense orbit. In other words it is a prehomogenous vector space . Sato and Kimura described the ring of semi-invariants in such case.  Sato–Kimura theorem  Let Q be a Dynkin quiver , d a dimension vector. Let ∑ be the set of weights σ such that there exists f σ ∈ SI(Q, d ) σ non-zero and irreducible. Then the following properties hold true.  i) For every weight σ we have dim k SI(Q, d ) σ ≤ 1.  ii) All weights in ∑ are linearly independent over ℚ.  iii) SI(Q, d ) is the polynomial ring generated by the f σ 's, σ ∈ ∑.  Furthermore we have an interpretation for the generators of this polynomial algebra. Let O be the open orbit, then k [Rep(Q, d )] \ O = Z 1 ∪ ... ∪ Z t where each Z i is closed and irreducible. We can assume that the Z i s are arranged in increasing order with respect to the codimension so that the first l have codimension one and Z i is the zero-set of the irreducible polynomial f 1 , then SI(Q, d ) = k [ f 1 , ..., f l ].  Example  In the example above the action of GL( n , n ) has an open orbit on M ( n ) consisting of invertible matrices. Then we immediately recover SI(Q,( n , n )) = k [det].  Skowronski–Weyman provided a geometric characterization of the class of tame quivers (i.e. Dynkin and Euclidean quivers ) in terms of semi-invariants.  Skowronski–Weyman theorem  Let Q be a finite connected quiver. The following are equivalent:  i) Q is either a Dynkin quiver or an Euclidean quiver .  ii) For each dimension vector d , the algebra SI(Q, d ) is complete intersection.  iii) For each dimension vector d , the algebra SI(Q, d ) is either a polynomial algebra or a hypersurface.  Example  Consider the Euclidean quiver Q:  (Figure)  4-subspace quiver   Pick the dimension vector d = (1,1,1,1,2). An element V ∈ k [Rep(Q, d )] can be identified with a 4-ple ( A 1 , A 2 , A 3 , A 4 ) of matrices in M (1,2). Call D i , j the function defined on each V as det( A i , A j ). Such functions generate the ring of semi-invariants:       S  I   (  Q  ,  𝐝  )    =    k   [   D   1  ,  2    ,   D   3  ,  4    ,   D   1  ,  4    ,   D   2  ,  3    ,   D   1  ,  3    ,   D   2  ,  4    ]        D   1  ,  2     D   3  ,  4     +    D   1  ,  4     D   2  ,  3      -    D   1  ,  3     D   2  ,  4             S  I   Q  𝐝        k    subscript  D   1  2     subscript  D   3  4     subscript  D   1  4     subscript  D   2  3     subscript  D   1  3     subscript  D   2  4             subscript  D   1  2     subscript  D   3  4        subscript  D   1  4     subscript  D   2  3         subscript  D   1  3     subscript  D   2  4         SI(Q,\mathbf{d})=\frac{k[D_{1,2},D_{3,4},D_{1,4},D_{2,3},D_{1,3},D_{2,4}]}{D_{%
