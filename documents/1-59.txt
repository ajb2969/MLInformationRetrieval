   Abbe number      Abbe number   (Figure)  An Abbe diagram plots the Abbe number against refractive index for a range of different glasses (red dots). Glasses are classified using the Schott Glass letter-number code to reflect their composition and position on the diagram.

It is named after Ernst Abbe (1840–1905), the German physicist who defined it.  The Abbe number, 2 3  V D , of a material is defined as        V  D   =     n  D   -  1     n  F   -   n  C      ,       subscript  V  D        subscript  n  D   1      subscript  n  F    subscript  n  C       V_{D}=\frac{n_{D}-1}{n_{F}-n_{C}},     where n D , n F and n C are the refractive indices of the material at the wavelengths of the Fraunhofer D-, F- and C- spectral lines (589.3 nm , 486.1 nm and 656.3 nm respectively).  Abbe numbers are used to classify glass and other optically transparent materials. For example, flint glass has V 50. Typical values of V range from around 20 for very dense flint glass, around 30 for polycarbonate plastics, and up to 65 for very light crown glass, and up to 85 for fluor -crown glass. Abbe numbers are only a useful measure of dispersion for visible light, and for other wavelengths, or for higher precision work, the group velocity dispersion (the full dispersion relation) is used.  Due to the difficulty and inconvenience in producing sodium and hydrogen lines, alternate definitions of the Abbe number are used in some contexts ( ISO 7944). 4 The value V d is given by       V  d   =     n  d   -  1     n  F   -   n  C          subscript  V  d        subscript  n  d   1      subscript  n  F    subscript  n  C       V_{d}=\frac{n_{d}-1}{n_{F}-n_{C}}   which defines the Abbe number with respect to the yellow Fraunhofer d (or D 3 ) helium line at 587.5618 nm wavelength. It can also be defined using the green mercury E-line at 546.073 nm:       V  e   =     n  e   -  1     n   F  ′    -   n   C  ′           subscript  V  e        subscript  n  e   1      subscript  n   superscript  F  normal-′     subscript  n   superscript  C  normal-′        V_{e}=\frac{n_{e}-1}{n_{F^{\prime}}-n_{C^{\prime}}}   where F' and C' are the blue and red cadmium lines at 480.0 nm and 643.8 nm, respectively.  An Abbe diagram is produced by plotting the Abbe number V d of a material versus its refractive index n d . Glasses can then be categorised by their composition and position on the diagram. This can be a letter-number code, as used in the Schott Glass catalogue, or a 6-digit glass code .  Abbe numbers are used to calculate the necessary focal lengths of achromatic doublet  lenses to minimize chromatic aberration .  The following table lists standard wavelengths at which n is usually determined, indicated by subscripts. 5 For example, n D is measured at 589.3 nm:      λ in nm   Fraunhofer's symbol   Light source   Color       365.01   i   Hg   UV     404.66   h   Hg   violet     435.84   g   Hg   blue     479.99   F'   Cd   blue     486.13   F   H   blue     546.07   e   Hg   green     587.56   d   He   yellow     589.3   D   Na   yellow     643.85   C'   Cd   red     656.27   C   H   red     706.52   r   He   red     768.2   A'   K   IR     852.11   s   Cs   IR     1013.98   t   Hg   IR     See also   Abbe prism  Abbe refractometer  Calculation of glass properties , including Abbe number  Glass code   References  External links   Abbe graph and data for 356 glasses from Ohara, Hoya, and Schott   "  Category:Dimensionless numbers  Category:Optics  Category:Glass physics     Abbe number calculation of glasses ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  L.
