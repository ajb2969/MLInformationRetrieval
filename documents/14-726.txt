Algebraic interior
In [[functional analysis]], a branch of mathematics, the '''algebraic interior''' or '''radial kernel''' of a subset of a [[vector space
 ]] is a refinement of the concept of the interior. It is the subset of points contained in a given set that it is absorbing with respect to, i.e. the radial points of the set.1 The elements of the algebraic interior are often referred to as internal points.23
Formally, if 
 
 
 
  is a linear space then the algebraic interior of 
 
 
 
  is

Relation to interior
Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological vector space, 
 
 
 
  denote the interior operator, and 
 
 
 
  then:




If 
 
 
 
  is nonempty convex and 
 
 
 
  is finite-dimensional, then

If 
 
 
 
  is convex with non-empty interior, then

If 
 
 
 
  is a closed convex set and 
 
 
 
  is a complete metric space, then
