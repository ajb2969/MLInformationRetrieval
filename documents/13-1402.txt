In this system, the base physical units are chosen so that the total mass, M , the gravitational constant , G , and the virial radius , R , are normalized. The underlying assumption is that the system of N objects (stars) satisfies the virial theorem . The consequence of standard N-body units is that the velocity dispersion of the system, v , is      1  2     2         1  2     2     \scriptstyle\frac{1}{2}\sqrt{2}   and that the dynamical or crossing time, t , is    2   2       2    2     \scriptstyle 2\sqrt{2}   . The use of standard N-body units was advocated by Michel Hénon in 1971. 1 Early adopters of this system of units included H. Cohn in 1979 2 and D. Heggie and R. Mathieu in 1986. 3 At the conference MODEST14 in 2014, D. Heggie proposed that the community abandon the name "N-body units" and replace it with the name "Hénon units" to commemorate the originator. 4  References  External links   N-Body Units  STELLAR DYNAMICS by D.C.
