   Nucleus (order theory)      Nucleus (order theory)   In mathematics, and especially in order theory , a nucleus is a function   F   F   F   on a meet-semilattice    𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   such that (for every   p   p   p   in   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   ): 1       p  ≤   F   (  p  )        p    F  p     p\leq F(p)          F   (   F   (  p  )    )    =   F   (  p  )          F    F  p      F  p     F(F(p))=F(p)          F   (   p  ∧  q   )    =    F   (  p  )    ∧   F   (  q  )           F    p  q        F  p     F  q      F(p\wedge q)=F(p)\wedge F(q)      Every nucleus is evidently a monotone function.  Frames and locales  Usually, the term nucleus is used in frames and locales theory (when the semilattice   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   is a frame).  Proposition: If   F   F   F   is a nucleus on a frame   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   , then the poset    Fix   (  F  )      Fix  F    \operatorname{Fix}(F)   of fixed points of   F   F   F   , with order inherited from   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   , is also a frame. 2  References  "  Category:Order theory     ↩  ↩
