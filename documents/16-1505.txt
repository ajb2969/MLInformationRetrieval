Nucleus (order theory)

In mathematics, and especially in order theory, a nucleus is a function 
 
 
 
  on a meet-semilattice

 
  such that (for every 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 ):1











Every nucleus is evidently a monotone function.
Frames and locales
Usually, the term nucleus is used in frames and locales theory (when the semilattice 
 
 
 
  is a frame).
Proposition: If 
 
 
 
 
  is a nucleus on a frame 
 
 
 
 , then the poset 
 
 
 
  of fixed points of 
 
 
 
 , with order inherited from 
 
 
 
 , is also a frame.2
