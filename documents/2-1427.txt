   Mahlo cardinal      Mahlo cardinal   In mathematics , a Mahlo cardinal is a certain kind of large cardinal number. Mahlo cardinals were first described by . As with all large cardinals, none of these varieties of Mahlo cardinals can be proved to exist by ZFC (assuming ZFC is consistent).  A cardinal number κ is called Mahlo if κ is inaccessible and the set U = {λ \aleph_0 with the required property because {2,3,4,...} is club in ω but contains no regular ordinals; so κ is uncountable. And it is a regular limit of regular cardinals; so it is weakly inaccessible. Then one uses the set of uncountable limit cardinals below κ as a club set to show that the stationary set may be assumed to consist of weak inaccessibles.   If κ is weakly Mahlo and also a strong limit, then κ is Mahlo.   κ is weakly inaccessible and a strong limit, so it is strongly inaccessible.  We show that the set of uncountable strong limit cardinals below κ is club in κ. Let μ 0 be the larger of the threshold and ω 1 . For each finite n, let μ n+1 = 2 μ n which is less than κ because it is a strong limit cardinal. Then their limit is a strong limit cardinal and is less than κ by its regularity. The limits of uncountable strong limit cardinals are also uncountable strong limit cardinals. So the set of them is club in κ. Intersect that club set with the stationary set of weakly inaccessible cardinals less than κ to get a stationary set of strongly inaccessible cardinals less than κ.  Example: showing that Mahlo cardinals are hyper-inaccessible  Suppose κ is Mahlo. We proceed by transfinite induction on α to show that κ is α-inaccessible for any α ≤ κ. Since κ is Mahlo, κ is inaccessible; and thus 0-inaccessible, which is the same thing.  If κ is α-inaccessible, then there are β-inaccessibles (for β 0. Then pick an α 0 -inaccessible, call it α 1 . Keep repeating this and taking limits at limits until you reach a fixed point, call it μ. Then μ has the required property (being a simultaneous limit of α-inaccessibles for all α +-Mahlo''' if and only if it is inaccessible and there is a normal (i.e. nontrivial and closed under diagonal intersections ) κ-complete filter on the power set of κ that is closed under the Mahlo operation, which maps the set of ordinals S to {α   ∈     \in    S : α has uncountable cofinality and S∩α is stationary in α}  The properties of being inaccessible, Mahlo, weakly Mahlo, α-Mahlo, greatly Mahlo, etc. are preserved if we replace the universe by an inner model .  The Mahlo operation  If X is a class of ordinals, them we can form a new class of ordinals M ( X ) consisting of the ordinals α of uncountable cofinality such that α∩ X is stationary in α. This operation M is called the Mahlo operation . It can be used to define Mahlo cardinals: for example, if X is the class of regular cardinals, then M ( X ) is the class of weakly Mahlo cardinals. The condition that α has uncountable cofinality ensures that the closed unbounded subsets of α are closed under intersection and so form a filter; in practice the elements of X often already have uncountable cofinality in which case this condition is redundant. Some authors add the condition that α is in X , which in practice usually makes little difference as it is often automatically satisfied.  For a fixed regular uncountable cardinal κ, the Mahlo operation induces an operation on the Boolean algebra of all subsets of κ modulo the non-stationary ideal.  The Mahlo operation can be iterated transfinitely as follows:   M 0 ( X ) = X  M α+1 ( X ) = M ( M α ( X ))  If α is a limit ordinal then M α ( X ) is the intersection of M β ( X ) for β<α   These iterated Mahlo operations produce the classes of α-Mahlo cardinals starting with the class of strongly inaccessible cardinals.  It is also possible to diagonalize this process by defining   M Δ ( X ) is the set of ordinals α that are in M β ( X ) for β<α.   And of course this diagonalization process can be iterated too. The diagonalized Mahlo operation produces the hyper-Mahlo cardinals, and so on.  See also   Inaccessible cardinal  Stationary set  Inner model   References         "  Category:Large cardinals
