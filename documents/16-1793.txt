Draft:Differential graded module

A 
 
 
 
 -graded module together with a differential; i.e., a square-zero endomorphism of the module.
Example: spectral sequence
The category of differential modules over a ring R coincides with the category of modules over the ring 
 
 
 
  of dual numbers over R.(Cartan-Eilenberg)
