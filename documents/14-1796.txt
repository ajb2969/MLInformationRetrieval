   Τ-additivity      Τ-additivity   In mathematics , in the field of measure theory , τ-additivity is a certain property of measures on topological spaces .  A measure µ on a space X , defined on a sigma-algebra Σ is said to be τ-additive, if for any upward-directed family    𝒢  ⊆  Σ      𝒢  normal-Σ    \mathcal{G}\subseteq\Sigma   of nonempty open sets, such that its union is in Σ, the measure of the union is the supremum of measures of elements of   𝒢   𝒢   \mathcal{G}   , i.e.:       μ   (   ⋃  𝒢   )    =    sup   G  ∈  𝒢     μ   (  G  )           μ    𝒢      subscript  supremum    G  𝒢      μ  G      \mu\left(\bigcup\mathcal{G}\right)=\sup_{G\in\mathcal{G}}\mu(G)     References    .
