Albrecht v. Herald Co.

Albrecht v. Herald Co., , was a decision by the United States Supreme Court, which held that wholesalers could not require franchisees and retailers of their products to sell items at a certain price; advertisements regarding sales, therefore, always included the language "Available at participating retailers only". This broad rule was reversed in 1997 by State Oil Co. v. Khan, which held that such price-setting was not inherently anti-competitive and not a violation of antitrust law.
Albrecht drew heavy criticism by economists, because vertical price fixing, particularly in the newspaper industry, actually increases consumer welfare, which is considered to be a primary goal of antitrust.12
Facts
Lester J. Albrecht, an independent newspaper carrier, bought from Herald Publishing Company at wholesale and sold at retail copies of Herald's morning newspaper, the St. Louis Globe-Democrat, under an exclusive territory arrangement terminable if a carrier exceeded the maximum retail price advertised by Albrecht. When Albrecht exceeded that price, Herald Co. protested to him and then informed Albrecht's subscribers that it would itself deliver the paper at the lower price. Herald Co. engaged an agency (Milne) to solicit petitioner's customers. About 300 of Albrecht's 1200 subscribers switched to direct delivery by Herald.
Herald Co. later turned these customers over, without cost, to another carrier (Kroner), who was aware of Herald's purpose and knew that he might have to return the route if Albrecht discontinued his pricing practice. Herald Co. told Albrecht that he could have his customers back if he adhered to the suggested price. Albrecht filed a treble-damage complaint which, as later amended, charged a combination in restraint of trade in violation of section 1 of the Sherman Antitrust Act, between Herald, Albrecht's customers, Milne, and Kroner. Albrecht's appointment as carrier was terminated and Herald sold his route.
Judgment
The Supreme Court held that Herald Co. acted unlawfully by requiring retailers to sell newspapers at a particular price. 
Economic background
A newspaper's profits are determined by its circulation $n$ and the number of advertisements $a$ it sells. Like in every circulation industry, circulation depends upon the price of a copy, as well as the amount of advertising$$n = N(P_{n}, a)$$. Similarly, the demand for advertising space is determined by $a = A(P_{a}, n)$. In other words: the higher the circulation, the higher the demand for advertising space. The profit-maxizing newspaper monopolist therefore sets his copy price as:
$P_{n} = \frac{C_{n} - \frac{\part A}{\part n}(P_{a} - \frac{\part C}{\part a})}{1 - \frac{\delta}{\epsilon_{n}}}$
where $C_{n}$ is the cost per copy, $\frac{\part C}{\part a}$ is the marginal cost of advertisement, $\epsilon_{n} = -\frac{\part N}{\part P_{n}}\frac{P_{n}}{n}$ is the traditional price elasticity of demand, and $\delta = 1 - \frac{\part N}{\part a} \frac{\part A}{\part n}$ captures the feedback effect of lower copy prices inducing more advertising and vice versa. Most important is the term $-\frac{\part A}{\part n}(P_{a} - \frac{\part C}{\part a})$, which captures the marginal advertising profit from selling additional advertising due to increased circulation.3 The newspaper monopolist's optimal price is therefore lower than for traditional monopolists in non-circulation industries.
