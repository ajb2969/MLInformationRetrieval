   Perfect spline      Perfect spline   In the mathematical subfields function theory and numerical analysis , a univariate polynomial spline of order   m   m   m   is called a perfect spline if its   m   m   m   -th derivative is equal to    +  1      1    +1   or    -  1      1    -1   between knots and changes its sign at every knot.  The term was coined by Isaac Jacob Schoenberg .  Perfect splines often give solutions to various extremal problems in mathematics. For example norms of periodic perfect splines (they are sometimes called Euler perfect splines ) are equal to Favard's constants .  "  Category:Splines  Category:Interpolation
