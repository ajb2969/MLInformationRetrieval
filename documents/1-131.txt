They are indexed by two nonnegative integers; the binomial coefficient indexed by n and k is usually written    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   . It is the coefficient of the x  k term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial  power (1 + x )  n . Under suitable circumstances the value of the coefficient is given by the expression     n  !     k  !     (   n  -  k   )   !          n       k       n  k       \tfrac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!}   . Arranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of n , and in which k ranges from 0 to n , gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle .  This family of numbers also arises in many areas of mathematics other than algebra, especially in combinatorics .    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   is often read aloud as " n choose k ", because there are    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. The properties of binomial coefficients have led to extending the meaning of the symbol    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   beyond the basic case where n and k are nonnegative integers with ; such expressions are still called binomial coefficients.  The notation    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   was introduced by Andreas von Ettingshausen in 1826, 1 although the numbers were already known centuries before that (see Pascal's triangle ). The earliest known detailed discussion of binomial coefficients is in a tenth-century commentary, by Halayudha , on an ancient Sanskrit text, Pingala 's Chandaḥśāstra. In about 1150, the Indian mathematician Bhaskaracharya gave an exposition of binomial coefficients in his book Lilavati . 2  Alternative notations include C ( n , k ), n C k , n C k , C k n , C n k , 3  C n , k in all of which the C stands for combinations or choices . Many calculators use similar variants of the C notation as it can be represented on a single-line display.  Definition and interpretations  For natural numbers (taken to include 0) n and k , the binomial coefficient    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   can be defined as the coefficient of the monomial  X k in the expansion of . The same coefficient also occurs (if ) in the binomial formula (valid for any elements x , y of a commutative ring ), which explains the name "binomial coefficient".  Another occurrence of this number is in combinatorics, where it gives the number of ways, disregarding order, that k objects can be chosen from among n objects; more formally, the number of k -element subsets (or k - combinations ) of an n -element set. This number can be seen as equal to the one of the first definition, independently of any of the formulas below to compute it: if in each of the n factors of the power one temporarily labels the term X with an index i (running from 1 to n ), then each subset of k indices gives after expansion a contribution X k , and the coefficient of that monomial in the result will be the number of such subsets. This shows in particular that    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   is a natural number for any natural numbers n and k . There are many other combinatorial interpretations of binomial coefficients (counting problems for which the answer is given by a binomial coefficient expression), for instance the number of words formed of n  bits (digits 0 or 1) whose sum is k is given by    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   , while the number of ways to write    k  =    a  1   +   a  2   +  ⋯  +   a  n        k     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯   subscript  a  n      k=a_{1}+a_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}   where every a i is a nonnegative integer is given by    (        n  +  k   -  1        n  -  1       )     binomial      n  k   1     n  1     {\textstyle\left({{n+k-1}\atop{n-1}}\right)}   . Most of these interpretations are easily seen to be equivalent to counting k -combinations.  Computing the value of binomial coefficients  Several methods exist to compute the value of    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   without actually expanding a binomial power or counting k -combinations.  Recursive formula  One method uses the recursive , purely additive, formula         (     n      k     )   =     (      n  -  1        k  -  1      )   +   (      n  -  1       k     )     for all integers  n   ,  k    :   1  ≤  k  ≤   n  -  1     ,     normal-:     binomial  n  k       binomial    n  1     k  1     binomial    n  1   k      for all integers  n   k        1  k         n  1       {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}={\left({{n-1}\atop{k-1}}\right)}+{\left({{n-1}%
 \atop{k}}\right)}\quad\text{for all integers }n,k:1\leq k\leq n-1,     with initial/boundary values         (     n      0     )   =   (     n      n     )   =  1     for all integers  n   ≥  0    ,     formulae-sequence       binomial  n  0    binomial  n  n        1        for all integers  n   0     {\left({{n}\atop{0}}\right)}={\left({{n}\atop{n}}\right)}=1\quad\text{for all %
 integers }n\geq 0,     The formula follows from considering the set {1,2,3,…, n } and counting separately (a) the k -element groupings that include a particular set element, say “ i ”, in every group (since “ i ” is already chosen to fill one spot in every group, we need only choose k − 1 from the remaining n − 1) and (b) all the k -groupings that don’t include “ i ”; this enumerates all the possible k -combinations of n elements. It also follows from tracing the contributions to X k in . As there is zero X n +1 or X −1 in , one might extend the definition beyond the above boundaries to include    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   = 0 when either k > n or k \binom nk = \frac{n^{\underline{k}}}{k!} = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-(k-1))}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}=\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{n-(k-i)}{i}=\prod_{i=1}^k \frac{n+1-i}{i},  where the numerator of the first fraction    n   k  ¯      superscript  n   normal-¯  k     n^{\underline{k}}   is expressed as a falling factorial power . This formula is easiest to understand for the combinatorial interpretation of binomial coefficients. The numerator gives the number of ways to select a sequence of k distinct objects, retaining the order of selection, from a set of n objects. The denominator counts the number of distinct sequences that define the same k -combination when order is disregarded.  Factorial formula  Finally, though computationally unsuitable, there is the compact form, often used in proofs and derivations, which makes repeated use of the familiar factorial function:         (     n      k     )   =    n  !     k  !     (   n  -  k   )   !        for  0   ≤  k  ≤  n    ,     formulae-sequence     binomial  n  k       n       k       n  k             for  0   k       n      {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}=\frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!}\quad\text{for }\ 0\leq k%
 \leq n,     where n ! denotes the factorial of n . This formula follows from the multiplicative formula above by multiplying numerator and denominator by ; as a consequence it involves many factors common to numerator and denominator. It is less practical for explicit computation unless common factors are first cancelled (in particular since factorial values grow very rapidly). The formula does exhibit a symmetry that is less evident from the multiplicative formula (though it is from the definitions)  which leads to a more efficient multiplicative computational routine. Using the falling factorial notation ,        (     n      k     )   =   {       n   k  ¯    /   k  !         if   k   ≤    n  2           n    n  -  k   ¯    /    (   n  -  k   )   !         if   k   >    n  2          .       binomial  n  k    cases     superscript  n   normal-¯  k      k        if  k     n  2       superscript  n   normal-¯    n  k         n  k         if  k     n  2       {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}=\begin{cases}n^{\underline{k}}/k!&\text{if }\ k%
 \leq\frac{n}{2}\\
 n^{\underline{n-k}}/(n-k)!&\text{if }\ k>\frac{n}{2}\end{cases}.     Generalization and connection to the binomial series  The multiplicative formula allows the definition of binomial coefficients to be extended 4 by replacing n by an arbitrary number α (negative, real, complex) or even an element of any commutative ring in which all positive integers are invertible:         (     α      k     )   =    α   k  ¯     k  !    =    α   (   α  -  1   )    (   α  -  2   )   ⋯   (    α  -  k   +  1   )     k   (   k  -  1   )    (   k  -  2   )   ⋯  1       for  k   ∈   𝒩  and arbitrary  α     .     formulae-sequence       binomial  α  k      superscript  α   normal-¯  k      k             α    α  1     α  2   normal-⋯      α  k   1      k    k  1     k  2   normal-⋯  1          for  k     𝒩  and arbitrary  α      {\left({{\alpha}\atop{k}}\right)}=\frac{\alpha^{\underline{k}}}{k!}=\frac{%
 \alpha(\alpha-1)(\alpha-2)\cdots(\alpha-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 1}\quad\text{%
 for }k\in\mathcal{N}\text{ and arbitrary }\alpha.     With this definition one has a generalization of the binomial formula (with one of the variables set to 1), which justifies still calling the    (      α      k      )     binomial  α  k    {\textstyle\left({{\alpha}\atop{k}}\right)}   binomial coefficients:  This formula is valid for all complex numbers α and X with | X | (1+X)^\alpha(1+X)^\beta=(1+X)^{\alpha+\beta} \quad\text{and}\quad ((1+X)^\alpha)^\beta=(1+X)^{\alpha\beta}.  If α is a nonnegative integer n , then all terms with k > n are zero, and the infinite series becomes a finite sum, thereby recovering the binomial formula. However for other values of α , including negative integers and rational numbers, the series is really infinite.  Pascal's triangle  (Figure)  1000th row of Pascal's triangle, arranged vertically, with grey-scale representations of decimal digits of the coefficients, right-aligned. The left boundary of the image corresponds roughly to the graph of the logarithm of the binomial coefficients, and illustrates that they form a log-concave sequence .   Pascal's rule is the important recurrence relation which can be used to prove by mathematical induction that    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   is a natural number for all n and k , (equivalent to the statement that k! divides the product of k consecutive integers), a fact that is not immediately obvious from formula (1) .  Pascal's rule also gives rise to Pascal's triangle :        0:           1             1:          1    1            2:         1    2    1           3:        1    3    3    1          4:       1    4    6    4    1         5:      1    5    10    10    5    1        6:     1    6    15    20    15    6    1       7:    1    7    21    35    35    21    7    1      8:   1    8    28    56    70    56    28    8    1       Row number n contains the numbers    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   for k = 0,…, n . It is constructed by starting with ones at the outside and then always adding two adjacent numbers and writing the sum directly underneath. This method allows the quick calculation of binomial coefficients without the need for fractions or multiplications. For instance, by looking at row number 5 of the triangle, one can quickly read off that   ( x + y ) 5 = 1  x 5 + 5  x 4 y + 10  x 3 y 2 + 10  x 2 y 3 + 5  x  y 4 + 1  y 5 .   The differences between elements on other diagonals are the elements in the previous diagonal, as a consequence of the recurrence relation () above.  Combinatorics and statistics  Binomial coefficients are of importance in combinatorics , because they provide ready formulas for certain frequent counting problems:   There are    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements. See Combination .  There are    (        n  +  k   -  1       k      )     binomial      n  k   1   k    {\textstyle\left({{n+k-1}\atop{k}}\right)}   ways to choose k elements from a set of n elements if repetitions are allowed. See Multiset .  There are    (       n  +  k       k      )     binomial    n  k   k    {\textstyle\left({{n+k}\atop{k}}\right)}    strings containing k ones and n zeros.  There are    (       n  +  1       k      )     binomial    n  1   k    {\textstyle\left({{n+1}\atop{k}}\right)}   strings consisting of k ones and n zeros such that no two ones are adjacent. 5  The Catalan numbers are      1   n  +  1     (       2  n       n      )    .        1    n  1     binomial    2  n   n     \tfrac{1}{n+1}{\textstyle\left({{2n}\atop{n}}\right)}.     The binomial distribution in statistics is      (      n      k      )    p  k      (   1  -  p   )    n  -  k      .       binomial  n  k    superscript  p  k    superscript    1  p     n  k      {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}p^{k}(1-p)^{n-k}\!.      Binomial coefficients as polynomials  For any nonnegative integer k , the expression    (       t      k       )     binomial  t  k    \scriptstyle{{\left({{t}\atop{k}}\right)}}   can be simplified and defined as a polynomial divided by k !:        (     t      k     )   =     (  t  )   k    k  !    =     (  t  )   k     (  k  )   k    =    t   (   t  -  1   )    (   t  -  2   )   ⋯   (    t  -  k   +  1   )      k   (   k  -  1   )    (   k  -  2   )   ⋯  2   ⋅  1     ;         binomial  t  k      subscript  t  k     k            subscript  t  k    subscript  k  k             t    t  1     t  2   normal-⋯      t  k   1     normal-⋅    k    k  1     k  2   normal-⋯  2   1       {\left({{t}\atop{k}}\right)}=\frac{(t)_{k}}{k!}=\frac{(t)_{k}}{(k)_{k}}=\frac{%
 t(t-1)(t-2)\cdots(t-k+1)}{k(k-1)(k-2)\cdots 2\cdot 1};\,\!     This presents a polynomial in t with rational coefficients.  As such, it can be evaluated at any real or complex number t to define binomial coefficients with such first arguments. These "generalized binomial coefficients" appear in Newton's generalized binomial theorem .  For each k , the polynomial    (      t      k      )     binomial  t  k    {\textstyle\left({{t}\atop{k}}\right)}   can be characterized as the unique degree k polynomial p ( t ) satisfying p (0) = p (1) = ... = p ( k − 1) = 0 and p ( k ) = 1.  Its coefficients are expressible in terms of Stirling numbers of the first kind :        (     t      k     )   =    ∑   i  =  0   k     [     k      i     ]     t  i    k  !       .       binomial  t  k     superscript   subscript     i  0    k      delimited-[]   STACKED  k  i       superscript  t  i     k        {\left({{t}\atop{k}}\right)}=\sum_{i=0}^{k}\left[{k\atop i}\right]\frac{t^{i}}%
 {k!}.   The derivative of    (      t      k      )     binomial  t  k    {\textstyle\left({{t}\atop{k}}\right)}   can be calculated by logarithmic differentiation :         d   d  t     (     t      k     )    =    (     t      k     )     ∑   i  =  0    k  -  1      1   t  -  i        .          normal-d    normal-d  t     binomial  t  k       binomial  t  k     superscript   subscript     i  0      k  1      1    t  i        \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}{\left({{t}\atop{k}}\right)}={\left({{t}\atop{k}%
 }\right)}\sum_{i=0}^{k-1}\frac{1}{t-i}\,.     Binomial coefficients as a basis for the space of polynomials  Over any field of characteristic 0 (that is, any field that contains the rational numbers ), each polynomial p ( t ) of degree at most d is uniquely expressible as a linear combination     ∑   k  =  0   d     a  k    (      t      k      )        superscript   subscript     k  0    d      subscript  a  k    binomial  t  k      \sum_{k=0}^{d}a_{k}{\left({{t}\atop{k}}\right)}   of binomial coefficients. The coefficient a k is the k th difference of the sequence p (0), p (1), …, p ( k ). Explicitly, 6   Integer-valued polynomials  Each polynomial    (      t      k      )     binomial  t  k    {\textstyle\left({{t}\atop{k}}\right)}   is integer-valued : it takes integer values at integer inputs. (One way to prove this is by induction on k , using Pascal's identity .) Therefore any integer linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials is integer-valued too. Conversely, () shows that any integer-valued polynomial is an integer linear combination of these binomial coefficient polynomials. More generally, for any subring R of a characteristic 0 field K , a polynomial in K [ t ] takes values in R at all integers if and only if it is an R -linear combination of binomial coefficient polynomials.  Example  The integer-valued polynomial 3 t (3 t + 1)/2 can be rewritten as        9   (       t      2       )    +   6   (       t      1       )    +   0   (       t      0       )     .        9   binomial  t  2      6   binomial  t  1      0   binomial  t  0      9{\textstyle\left({{t}\atop{2}}\right)}+6{\textstyle\left({{t}\atop{1}}\right)%
 }+0{\textstyle\left({{t}\atop{0}}\right)}.     Identities involving binomial coefficients  The factorial formula facilitates relating nearby binomial coefficients. For instance, if k is a positive integer and n is arbitrary, then  and, with a little more work,         (      n  -  1       k     )   -   (      n  -  1        k  -  1      )    =     n  -   2  k    n    (     n      k     )     .         binomial    n  1   k    binomial    n  1     k  1           n    2  k    n    binomial  n  k      {\left({{n-1}\atop{k}}\right)}-{\left({{n-1}\atop{k-1}}\right)}=\frac{n-2k}{n}%
 {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}.   Moreover, the following may be useful:         (     n      h     )    (      n  -  h       k     )    =    (     n      k     )    (      n  -  k       h     )     .         binomial  n  h    binomial    n  h   k       binomial  n  k    binomial    n  k   h      {\left({{n}\atop{h}}\right)}{\left({{n-h}\atop{k}}\right)}={\left({{n}\atop{k}%
 }\right)}{\left({{n-k}\atop{h}}\right)}.   For constant n , we have the following recurrence:        (     n      k     )   =      n  +  1   -  k   k    (     n       k  -  1      )     .       binomial  n  k           n  1   k   k    binomial  n    k  1       {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}=\frac{n+1-k}{k}{\left({{n}\atop{k-1}}\right)}.     Series involving binomial coefficients  The formula  is obtained from () by setting x = 1 and y = 1. This is equivalent to saying that the elements in one row of Pascal's triangle always add up to two raised to an integer power. A combinatorial interpretation of this fact involving double counting is given by counting subsets of size 0, size 1, size 2, and so on up to size n of a set S of n elements. Since we count the number of subsets of size i for 0 ≤ i ≤ n , this sum must be equal to the number of subsets of S , which is known to be 2 n . That is, () is the statement that the power set of a finite set with n elements has size 2 n . More explicitly, consider a bit string with n digits. This bit string can be used to represent 2 n numbers. Now consider all of the bit strings with no ones in them. There is just one, or rather n choose 0. Next consider the number of bit strings with just a single one in them. There are n , or rather n choose 1. Continuing this way we can see that the equation above holds.  The formulas  and      ∑   k  =  0   n     k  2    (      n      k      )     =    (   n  +   n  2    )    2   n  -  2           superscript   subscript     k  0    n      superscript  k  2    binomial  n  k         n   superscript  n  2     superscript  2    n  2       \sum_{k=0}^{n}k^{2}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}=(n+n^{2})2^{n-2}   follow from () after differentiating with respect to x (twice in the latter) and then substituting x = 1.  The Chu–Vandermonde identity , which holds for any complex-values m and n and any non-negative integer k , is  and can be found by examination of the coefficient of    x  k     superscript  x  k    x^{k}   in the expansion of (1 + x ) m (1 + x ) n − m = (1 + x ) n using equation (). When m = 1, equation () reduces to equation ().  A similar looking formula, which applies for any integers j , k , and n satisfying 0 ≤ j ≤ k ≤ n , is  and can be found by examination of the coefficient of    x   n  +  1      superscript  x    n  1     x^{n+1}   in the expansion of     x   (    x  j     (   1  -  x   )    j  +  1     )    (    x   k  -  j      (   1  -  x   )     k  -  j   +  1     )    =    x   k  +  1      (   1  -  x   )    k  +  2           x     superscript  x  j    superscript    1  x     j  1        superscript  x    k  j     superscript    1  x       k  j   1         superscript  x    k  1     superscript    1  x     k  2       x\left(\tfrac{x^{j}}{(1-x)^{j+1}}\right)\left(\tfrac{x^{k-j}}{(1-x)^{k-j+1}}%
 \right)=\tfrac{x^{k+1}}{(1-x)^{k+2}}   using       x  l     (   1  -  x   )    l  +  1     =    ∑   p  =  0   ∞     (      p      l      )     x  p       .         superscript  x  l    superscript    1  x     l  1       superscript   subscript     p  0         binomial  p  l    superscript  x  p       \tfrac{x^{l}}{(1-x)^{l+1}}=\sum_{p=0}^{\infty}{\textstyle\left({{p}\atop{l}}%
 \right)}x^{p}\,.   When j = k , equation () gives         ∑   m  =  0   n    (       m      k       )    =    (        n  +  1        k  +  1        )     .        superscript   subscript     m  0    n    binomial  m  k     binomial    n  1     k  1      \sum_{m=0}^{n}{\textstyle\left({{m}\atop{k}}\right)}={\textstyle\left({{n+1}%
 \atop{k+1}}\right)}\,.     From expansion () using n = 2 m , k = m , and (), one finds  Let F ( n ) denote the n -th Fibonacci number . We obtain a formula about the diagonals of Pascal's triangle       ∑   k  =  0    ⌊   n  2   ⌋     (       n  -  k       k      )    =   F   (   n  +  1   )     .        superscript   subscript     k  0        n  2      binomial    n  k   k      F    n  1      \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}{\textstyle\left({{n-k}\atop{k}}\right)}%
 =F(n+1).     This can be proved by induction using () or by Zeckendorf's representation (Just note that the lhs gives the number of subsets of { F (2),..., F ( n )} without consecutive members, which also form all the numbers below F ( n + 1)). A combinatorial proof is given below.  Another identity that follows from () with j=k-1 is       ∑   j  =  k   n     (    n  +  1   -  j   )    (       j  -  1        k  -  1       )     =   (       n  +  1        k  +  1       )    .        superscript   subscript     j  k    n         n  1   j    binomial    j  1     k  1       binomial    n  1     k  1      \sum_{j=k}^{n}(n+1-j){\textstyle\left({{j-1}\atop{k-1}}\right)}={\textstyle%
 \left({{n+1}\atop{k+1}}\right)}.     Although there is no closed formula for       ∑   j  =  0   k    (       n      j       )       superscript   subscript     j  0    k    binomial  n  j     \sum_{j=0}^{k}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{j}}\right)}     (unless one resorts to Hypergeometric functions ), 7 one can again use () and induction, to show that for k = 0, ..., n − 1      ∑   j  =  0   k      (   -  1   )   j    (      n      j      )     =     (   -  1   )   k    (       n  -  1       k      )          superscript   subscript     j  0    k      superscript    1   j    binomial  n  j        superscript    1   k    binomial    n  1   k      \sum_{j=0}^{k}(-1)^{j}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{j}}\right)}=(-1)^{k}{%

Differentiating () k times and setting x = −1 yields this for     P   (  x  )    =   x   (   x  -  1   )   ⋯   (    x  -  k   +  1   )          P  x     x    x  1   normal-⋯      x  k   1      P(x)=x(x-1)\cdots(x-k+1)   , when 0 ≤ k \sum_{j=0}^n (-1)^j\tbinom n j P(n-j) = n!a_n| 10 }}  where    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   is the coefficient of degree n in P ( x ).  More generally for (),        ∑   j  =  0   n      (   -  1   )   j    (      n      j      )   P   (   m  +    (   n  -  j   )   d    )     =    d  n    n  !    a  n          superscript   subscript     j  0    n      superscript    1   j    binomial  n  j   P    m      n  j   d         superscript  d  n     n    subscript  a  n      \sum_{j=0}^{n}(-1)^{j}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{j}}\right)}P(m+(n-j)d)=d^{n}n%
 !a_{n}   where m and d are complex numbers. This follows immediately applying () to the polynomial Q(x):=P(m + dx) instead of P(x) , and observing that Q(x) has still degree less than or equal to n , and that its coefficient of degree n is d n a n .  The series        k  -  1   k     ∑   j  =  0   ∞    1   (       j  +  x       k      )      =   1   (       x  -  1        k  -  1       )              k  1   k     superscript   subscript     j  0        1   binomial    j  x   k        1   binomial    x  1     k  1       \frac{k-1}{k}\sum_{j=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{{\left({{j+x}\atop{k}}\right)}}=\frac%

It follows from       k  -  1   k     ∑   j  =  0   M    1   (       j  +  x       k      )      =    1   (       x  -  1        k  -  1       )    -   1   (       M  +  x        k  -  1       )               k  1   k     superscript   subscript     j  0    M     1   binomial    j  x   k          1   binomial    x  1     k  1       1   binomial    M  x     k  1        \frac{k-1}{k}\sum_{j=0}^{M}\frac{1}{{\left({{j+x}\atop{k}}\right)}}=\frac{1}{{%

Using () one can derive      ∑   i  =  0   n    i    (      n      i      )   2     =    n  2    (       2  n       n      )          superscript   subscript     i  0    n     i   superscript   binomial  n  i   2         n  2    binomial    2  n   n      \sum_{i=0}^{n}{i{\left({{n}\atop{i}}\right)}^{2}}=\frac{n}{2}{\left({{2n}\atop%

Series multisection gives the following identity for the sum of binomial coefficients taken with a step s and offset t     n  ≥  q      n  q    {n}\geq{q}     Identities with combinatorial proofs  Many identities involving binomial coefficients can be proved by combinatorial means . For example, the following identity for nonnegative integers      ∑   k  =  q   n     (       n      k       )    (       k      q       )     =    2   n  -  q     (       n      q       )          superscript   subscript     k  q    n      binomial  n  k    binomial  k  q        superscript  2    n  q     binomial  n  q      \sum_{k=q}^{n}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}{\textstyle\left({{k}\atop%
 {q}}\right)}=2^{n-q}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{q}}\right)}   (which reduces to () when q = 1):      (      n      q      )     binomial  n  q    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{q}}\right)}     can be given a double counting proof as follows. The left side counts the number of ways of selecting a subset of [ n ] = {1, 2, …, n} with at least q elements, and marking q elements among those selected. The right side counts the same parameter, because there are     2   n  -  q    .     superscript  2    n  q     2^{n-q}.   ways of choosing a set of q marks and they occur in all subsets that additionally contain some subset of the remaining elements, of which there are     (     n      k     )   =    (      n  -  1        k  -  1      )   +   (      n  -  1       k     )         binomial  n  k      binomial    n  1     k  1     binomial    n  1   k      {n\choose k}={n-1\choose k-1}+{n-1\choose k}     In the Pascal's rule         ∑   k  =  0   n     (       n      k       )   2    =   (        2  n       n       )    .        superscript   subscript     k  0    n    superscript   binomial  n  k   2     binomial    2  n   n     \sum_{k=0}^{n}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}^{2}={\textstyle\left({{2n%
 }\atop{n}}\right)}.   both sides count the number of k -element subsets of [ n ] with the right hand side ﬁrst grouping them into those that contain element n and those that do not.  The identity () also has a combinatorial proof. The identity reads      2  n      2  n    2n     Suppose you have    (       2  n       n      )     binomial    2  n   n    {\textstyle\left({{2n}\atop{n}}\right)}   empty squares arranged in a row and you want to mark (select) n of them. There are    n  -  k      n  k    n-k   ways to do this. On the other hand, you may select your n squares by selecting k squares from among the first n and       ∑   k  =  0   n     (       n      k       )    (       n       n  -  k        )     =   (        2  n       n       )    .        superscript   subscript     k  0    n      binomial  n  k    binomial  n    n  k       binomial    2  n   n     \sum_{k=0}^{n}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}{\textstyle\left({{n}\atop%
 {n-k}}\right)}={\textstyle\left({{2n}\atop{n}}\right)}.   squares from the remaining n squares; any k from 0 to n will work. This gives        ∑   k  =  0    ⌊   n  2   ⌋     (        n  -  k       k       )    =   F   (   n  +  1   )          superscript   subscript     k  0        n  2      binomial    n  k   k      F    n  1      \sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor}{\textstyle\left({{n-k}\atop{k}}\right)}%
 =F(n+1)   Now apply () to get the result.  The identity ( 9 ),      (       n  -  k       k      )     binomial    n  k   k    {\textstyle\left({{n-k}\atop{k}}\right)}     has the following combinatorial proof. The number    (  0  ,  0  )     0  0    (0,0)   denotes the number of paths in a two-dimensional lattice from    (  k  ,   n  -  k   )     k    n  k     (k,n-k)   to    (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)   using steps    (  1  ,  1  )     1  1    (1,1)   and    (   n  -  k   )      n  k    (n-k)   . This is easy to see: there are   k   k   k   steps in total and one may choose the    (  1  ,  1  )     1  1    (1,1)       (  1  ,  1  )     1  1    (1,1)   steps. Now, replace each    (  0  ,  2  )     0  2    (0,2)   step by a   k   k   k   step; note that there are exactly    (  0  ,  n  )     0  n    (0,n)   . Then one arrives at point    (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)   using steps    (  0  ,  2  )     0  2    (0,2)   and   k   k   k   . Doing this for all   0   0    between    ⌊   n  2   ⌋        n  2     \lfloor\frac{n}{2}\rfloor   and    (  0  ,  0  )     0  0    (0,0)   gives all paths from    (  0  ,  n  )     0  n    (0,n)   to    (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)   using steps    (  0  ,  2  )     0  2    (0,2)   and    F   (   n  +  1   )       F    n  1     F(n+1)   . Clearly, there are exactly      ∑   0  ≤  k  ≤  n     (      n      k      )    =   2  n         subscript       0  k       n      binomial  n  k     superscript  2  n     \sum_{0\leq{k}\leq{n}}{\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}=2^{n}   such paths.  Sum of coefficients row  The number of k - combinations for all k ,     2  n   -  1       superscript  2  n   1    2^{n}-1   , is the sum of the n th row (counting from 0) of the binomial coefficients.

Generating functions  Ordinary generating functions  For a fixed n , the ordinary generating function of the sequence       ∑  k     (     n      k     )    x  k     =    (   1  +  x   )   n    .        subscript   k      binomial  n  k    superscript  x  k      superscript    1  x   n     \sum_{k}{n\choose k}x^{k}=(1+x)^{n}.   is:       (      0      k      )   ,   (      1      k      )   ,   (      2      k      )   ,  …      binomial  0  k    binomial  1  k    binomial  2  k   normal-…    {0\choose k},\;{1\choose k},\;{2\choose k},\;\ldots     For a fixed k , the ordinary generating function of the sequence       ∑   n  =  k   ∞     (     n      k     )    y  n     =    y  k     (   1  -  y   )    k  +  1      .        superscript   subscript     n  k         binomial  n  k    superscript  y  n        superscript  y  k    superscript    1  y     k  1       \sum_{n=k}^{\infty}{n\choose k}y^{n}=\frac{y^{k}}{(1-y)^{k+1}}.   is:         ∑   n  ,  k      (     n      k     )    x  k    y  n     =   1   1  -  y  -   x  y      .        subscript    n  k       binomial  n  k    superscript  x  k    superscript  y  n       1    1  y    x  y       \sum_{n,k}{n\choose k}x^{k}y^{n}=\frac{1}{1-y-xy}.     The bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is:         ∑   n  ,  k      (      n  +  k       k     )    x  k    y  n     =   1   1  -  x  -  y     .        subscript    n  k       binomial    n  k   k    superscript  x  k    superscript  y  n       1    1  x  y      \sum_{n,k}{n+k\choose k}x^{k}y^{n}=\frac{1}{1-x-y}.     Another bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients, which is symmetric, is:         ∑   n  ,  k      1    (   n  +  k   )   !     (      n  +  k       k     )    x  k    y  n     =   e   x  +  y     .        subscript    n  k        1      n  k      binomial    n  k   k    superscript  x  k    superscript  y  n      superscript  e    x  y      \sum_{n,k}\frac{1}{(n+k)!}{n+k\choose k}x^{k}y^{n}=e^{x+y}.     Exponential generating function  The exponential bivariate generating function of the binomial coefficients is:      (       m  +  n       m      )     binomial    m  n   m    {\textstyle\left({{m+n}\atop{m}}\right)}     Divisibility properties  In 1852, Kummer proved that if m and n are nonnegative integers and p is a prime number, then the largest power of p dividing    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   equals p c , where c is the number of carries when m and n are added in base p . Equivalently, the exponent of a prime p in    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   equals the number of nonnegative integers j such that the fractional part of k / p j is greater than the fractional part of n / p j . It can be deduced from this that    (       p  r       s      )     binomial   superscript  p  r   s    {\textstyle\left({{p^{r}}\atop{s}}\right)}   is divisible by n / gcd ( n , k ). In particular therefore it follows that p divides    (      9      6      )     binomial  9  6    {\textstyle\left({{9}\atop{6}}\right)}   for all positive integers r and s such that s  r . However this is not true of higher powers of p : for example 9 does not divide    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   .  A somewhat surprising result by David Singmaster (1974) is that any integer divides almost all binomial coefficients. More precisely, fix an integer d and let f ( N ) denote the number of binomial coefficients      lim   N  →  ∞      f   (  N  )      N   (   N  +  1   )    /  2     =  1.        subscript    normal-→  N         f  N       N    N  1    2     1.    \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{f(N)}{N(N+1)/2}=1.   with n \tbinom n k. Then      (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   Since the number of binomial coefficients     (     p      k     )   =     p  ⋅   (   p  -  1   )    ⋯   (    p  -  k   +  1   )      k  ⋅   (   k  -  1   )    ⋯  1         binomial  p  k        normal-⋅  p    p  1    normal-⋯      p  k   1       normal-⋅  k    k  1    normal-⋯  1      {\left({{p}\atop{k}}\right)}=\frac{p\cdot(p-1)\cdots(p-k+1)}{k\cdot(k-1)\cdots
 1}   with n \binom n 1, \binom n 2, \ldots, \binom n{n-1}  are divisible by n .  Proof: When p is prime, p divides      (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}   for all 0  \binom n p = \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-p+1)}{p!}=\frac{k(n-1)(n-2)\cdots(n-p+1)}{(p-1)!}\not\equiv 0 \pmod{n} otherwise the numerator k ( n − 1)( n − 2)×...×( n − p + 1) has to be divisible by n = k × p , this can only be the case when ( n − 1)( n − 2)×...×( n − p + 1) is divisible by p . But n is divisible by p , so p does not divide n − 1, n − 2, ..., n − p + 1 and because p is prime, we know that p does not divide ( n − 1)( n − 2)×...×( n − p + 1) and so the numerator cannot be divisible by n .

A simple and rough upper bound for the sum of binomial coefficients can be obtained using the binomial theorem :        (     n      k     )   =     2  n      1  2   n  π      e   -     (   k  -   (   n  /  2   )    )   2    n  /  2       [   1  +   O   (   1   n    )     ]     .       binomial  n  k        superscript  2  n         1  2   n  π      superscript  e       superscript    k    n  2    2     n  2       delimited-[]    1    O    1    n          {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}=\frac{2^{n}}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}n\pi}}e^{-\frac{(k-%
 (n/2))^{2}}{n/2}}\left[1+O\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{n}}\right)\right].     Approximations  For large values of n, the following gives an approximation of the binomial coefficient based on its relation to the normal distribution       n  p   ,   n  p   (   1  -  p   )         n  p     n  p    1  p      np,np(1-p)     This follows from the bounds on the Central Limit Theorem , taking a normal distribution with the same expectation and variance as the binomial distribution (    p  =   1  -  p   =   1  /  2         p    1  p          1  2      p=1-p=1/2   ), centering the probabilities, by setting     (     n        k  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,   k  r       )   =    n  !      k  1   !     k  2   !   ⋯    k  r   !          binomial  n    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-…   subscript  k  r         n        subscript  k  1       subscript  k  2    normal-⋯     subscript  k  r        {n\choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{r}}=\frac{n!}{k_{1}!k_{2}!\cdots k_{r}!}   , and multiplying both by .  Generalizations  Generalization to multinomials  Binomial coefficients can be generalized to multinomial coefficients defined to be the number:         ∑   i  =  1   r    k  i    =  n   .        superscript   subscript     i  1    r    subscript  k  i    n    \sum_{i=1}^{r}k_{i}=n.   where        (    x  1   +   x  2   +  ⋯  +   x  r    )   n   .     superscript     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-⋯   subscript  x  r    n    (x_{1}+x_{2}+\cdots+x_{r})^{n}.     While the binomial coefficients represent the coefficients of ( x + y ) n , the multinomial coefficients represent the coefficients of the polynomial        (     n        k  1   ,   k  2       )   =   (     n        k  1   ,   n  -   k  1        )   =   (     n       k  1      )   =   (     n       k  2      )    .         binomial  n    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2      binomial  n    subscript  k  1     n   subscript  k  1            binomial  n   subscript  k  1          binomial  n   subscript  k  2       {n\choose k_{1},k_{2}}={n\choose k_{1},n-k_{1}}={n\choose k_{1}}={n\choose k_{%

The case r = 2 gives binomial coefficients:       (     n        k  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,   k  r       )   =    (      n  -  1          k  1   -  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,   k  r       )   +   (      n  -  1         k  1   ,    k  2   -  1   ,  …  ,   k  r       )   +  …  +   (      n  -  1         k  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,    k  r   -  1       )         binomial  n    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-…   subscript  k  r        binomial    n  1       subscript  k  1   1    subscript  k  2   normal-…   subscript  k  r      binomial    n  1     subscript  k  1      subscript  k  2   1   normal-…   subscript  k  r     normal-…   binomial    n  1     subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-…     subscript  k  r   1        {n\choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{r}}={n-1\choose k_{1}-1,k_{2},\ldots,k_{r}}+{n%

 {r}-1}     The combinatorial interpretation of multinomial coefficients is distribution of n distinguishable elements over r (distinguishable) containers, each containing exactly k i elements, where i is the index of the container.  Multinomial coefficients have many properties similar to these of binomial coefficients, for example the recurrence relation:       (     n        k  1   ,   k  2   ,  …  ,   k  r       )   =   (     n        k   σ  1    ,   k   σ  2    ,  …  ,   k   σ  r        )        binomial  n    subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2   normal-…   subscript  k  r      binomial  n    subscript  k   subscript  σ  1     subscript  k   subscript  σ  2    normal-…   subscript  k   subscript  σ  r        {n\choose k_{1},k_{2},\ldots,k_{r}}={n\choose k_{\sigma_{1}},k_{\sigma_{2}},%
 \ldots,k_{\sigma_{r}}}   and symmetry:      (   σ  i   )     subscript  σ  i    (\sigma_{i})   where    z  0     subscript  z  0    z_{0}   is a permutation of (1,2,..., r ).  Taylor series  Using Stirling numbers of the first kind the series expansion around any arbitrarily chosen point     (      z      k      )   =     1   k  !        ∑   i  =  0   k      z  i    s   k  ,  i            binomial  z  k       1    k      superscript   subscript     i  0    k      superscript  z  i    subscript  s   k  i         \displaystyle{z\choose k}=\frac{1}{k!}\sum_{i=0}^{k}z^{i}s_{k,i}   is     n   n   n     === Binomial coefficient with n = ½ === The definition of the binomial coefficients can be extended to the case where   k   k   k   is real and   k   k   k   is integer.  In particular, the following identity holds for any non-negative integer      (      1  /  2       k     )   =    (      2  k       k     )      (   -  1   )    k  +  1      2   2  k     (    2  k   -  1   )       .       binomial    1  2   k      binomial    2  k   k      superscript    1     k  1       superscript  2    2  k        2  k   1        {{1/2}\choose{k}}={{2k}\choose{k}}\frac{(-1)^{k+1}}{2^{2k}(2k-1)}.   :       1  +  x         1  x     \sqrt{1+x}     This shows up when expanding       1  +  x    =    ∑   k  ⩾  0      (        1  /  2       k       )    x  k      .          1  x      subscript     k  0       binomial    1  2   k    superscript  x  k       \sqrt{1+x}=\sum_{k\geqslant 0}{{\textstyle\left({{1/2}\atop{k}}\right)}}x^{k}.   into a power series using the Newton binomial series :        (     z      m     )    (     z      n     )    =    ∑   k  =  0   m     (       m  +  n   -  k        k  ,   m  -  k   ,   n  -  k       )    (     z        m  +  n   -  k      )            binomial  z  m    binomial  z  n      superscript   subscript     k  0    m      binomial      m  n   k    k    m  k     n  k      binomial  z      m  n   k        {z\choose m}{z\choose n}=\sum_{k=0}^{m}{m+n-k\choose k,m-k,n-k}{z\choose m+n-k}     Identity for the product of binomial coefficients  One can express the product of binomial coefficients as a linear combination of binomial coefficients:        1   (      z      n      )    =    ∑   i  =  0    n  -  1       (   -  1   )    n  -  1  -  i     (     n      i     )     n  -  i    z  -  i       ,        1   binomial  z  n      superscript   subscript     i  0      n  1       superscript    1     n  1  i     binomial  n  i       n  i     z  i        \frac{1}{{z\choose n}}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(-1)^{n-1-i}{n\choose i}\frac{n-i}{z-i},     where the connection coefficients are multinomial coefficients . In terms of labelled combinatorial objects, the connection coefficients represent the number of ways to assign m+n-k labels to a pair of labelled combinatorial objects—of weight m and n respectively—that have had their first k labels identified, or glued together to get a new labelled combinatorial object of weight m+n-k . (That is, to separate the labels into three portions to apply to the glued part, the unglued part of the first object, and the unglued part of the second object.) In this regard, binomial coefficients are to exponential generating series what falling factorials are to ordinary generating series.  Partial fraction decomposition  The partial fraction decomposition of the reciprocal is given by        1   (       z  +  n       n      )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n      (   -  1   )    i  -  1     (      n      i      )    i   z  +  i       .        1   binomial    z  n   n      superscript   subscript     i  1    n      superscript    1     i  1     binomial  n  i     i    z  i        \frac{1}{{z+n\choose n}}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{i-1}{n\choose i}\frac{i}{z+i}.   and       (   1  +  z   )   α   =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     (     α      n     )    z  n     =   1  +    (     α      1     )   z   +    (     α      2     )    z  2    +  ⋯    .         superscript    1  z   α     superscript   subscript     n  0         binomial  α  n    superscript  z  n            1     binomial  α  1   z      binomial  α  2    superscript  z  2    normal-⋯      (1+z)^{\alpha}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{\alpha\choose n}z^{n}=1+{\alpha\choose 1}z+%
 {\alpha\choose 2}z^{2}+\cdots.     Newton's binomial series  Newton's binomial series, named after Sir Isaac Newton , is a generalization of the binomial theorem to infinite series:       1    (   1  -  z   )    α  +  1     =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     (      n  +  α       n     )    z  n           1   superscript    1  z     α  1       superscript   subscript     n  0         binomial    n  α   n    superscript  z  n       \frac{1}{(1-z)^{\alpha+1}}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}{n+\alpha\choose n}z^{n}     The identity can be obtained by showing that both sides satisfy the differential equation (1 + z ) f '( z ) = α f ( z ).  The radius of convergence of this series is 1. An alternative expression is       (     n      k     )   =     (   -  1   )   k    (      k  -  n  -  1       k     )         binomial  n  k      superscript    1   k    binomial    k  n  1   k      {n\choose k}=(-1)^{k}{k-n-1\choose k}     where the identity      (    (      n      k      )    )     binomial  n  k    \left(\!\!{\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}\!\!\right)     is applied.  Multiset (rising) binomial coefficient  Binomial coefficients count subsets of prescribed size from a given set. A related combinatorial problem is to count multisets of prescribed size with elements drawn from a given set, that is, to count the number of ways to select a certain number of elements from a given set with the possibility of selecting the same element repeatedly. The resulting numbers are called multiset coefficients ; 11 the number of ways to "multichoose" (i.e., choose with replacement) k items from an n element set is denoted      (      f      k      )   =   (    (      r      k      )    )   =   (        r  +  k   -  1       k      )    .         binomial  f  k    binomial  r  k         binomial      r  k   1   k      {\left({{f}\atop{k}}\right)}=\left(\!\!{\left({{r}\atop{k}}\right)}\!\!\right)%

Multiset coefficients may be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients by the rule          (  f  )   k   =   f   k  ¯    =     (    f  -  k   +  1   )   ⋯   (   f  -  3   )    ⋅   (   f  -  2   )   ⋅   (   f  -  1   )   ⋅  f          subscript  f  k    superscript  f   normal-¯  k          normal-⋅        f  k   1   normal-⋯    f  3      f  2     f  1   f      (f)_{k}=f^{\underline{k}}=(f-k+1)\cdots(f-3)\cdot(f-2)\cdot(f-1)\cdot f        One possible alternative characterization of this identity is as follows: We may define the falling factorial as         \color   w  h  i  t  e  |   r   (  k  )    =   r   k  ¯    =  r  ⋅   (  r  +  1  )   ⋅   (  r  +  2  )   ⋅   (  r  +  3  )   ⋯   (  r  +  k  -  1  )      fragments  \color  w  h  i  t  e  normal-|   superscript  r  k     superscript  r   normal-¯  k     r  normal-⋅   fragments  normal-(  r   1  normal-)   normal-⋅   fragments  normal-(  r   2  normal-)   normal-⋅   fragments  normal-(  r   3  normal-)   normal-⋯   fragments  normal-(  r   k   1  normal-)     {\color{white}{\big|}}r^{(k)}=\,r^{\overline{k}}=\,r\cdot(r+1)\cdot(r+2)\cdot(%

Then the binomial coefficients may be written as         (    (      r      k      )    )   =    r   (  k  )     k  !    =     r  ⋅   (   r  +  1   )   ⋅   (   r  +  2   )    ⋯   (    r  +  k   -  1   )      1  ⋅  2  ⋅  3  ⋅  4  ⋅  5   ⋯  k           binomial  r  k      superscript  r  k     k              normal-⋅  r    r  1     r  2    normal-⋯      r  k   1       normal-⋅  1  2  3  4  5   normal-⋯  k       \left(\!\!{\left({{r}\atop{k}}\right)}\!\!\right)=\frac{r^{(k)}}{k!}=\frac{r%
 \cdot(r+1)\cdot(r+2)\cdots(r+k-1)}{1\cdot 2\cdot 3\cdot 4\cdot 5\cdots k}   ,     while the corresponding multiset coefficient is defined by replacing the falling with the rising factorial:        (       -  n       k      )     binomial    n   k    \displaystyle{\left({{-n}\atop{k}}\right)}   .     Generalization to negative integers  For any n ,      n  =   -  1       n    1     n=-1   In particular, binomial coefficients evaluated at negative integers are given by signed multiset coefficients. In the special case       (   -  1   )   k   =   (       -  1       k      )   =   (    (       -  k       k      )    )    .         superscript    1   k    binomial    1   k         binomial    k   k      (-1)^{k}={\left({{-1}\atop{k}}\right)}=\left(\!\!{\left({{-k}\atop{k}}\right)}%
 \!\!\right)\,.   , this reduces to    (       -  4       7      )     binomial    4   7    \displaystyle{\left({{-4}\atop{7}}\right)}     For example, if n = -4 and k = 7, then r = 4 and f = 10:        (     x      y     )   =    Γ   (   x  +  1   )     Γ   (   y  +  1   )   Γ   (    x  -  y   +  1   )     =   1    (   x  +  1   )    \Beta    (    x  -  y   +  1   ,   y  +  1   )      .         binomial  x  y       normal-Γ    x  1      normal-Γ    y  1   normal-Γ      x  y   1            1      x  1   \Beta       x  y   1     y  1         {x\choose y}=\frac{\Gamma(x+1)}{\Gamma(y+1)\Gamma(x-y+1)}=\frac{1}{(x+1)\Beta(%
 x-y+1,y+1)}.     Two real or complex valued arguments  The binomial coefficient is generalized to two real or complex valued arguments using the gamma function or beta function via     Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   This definition inherits these following additional properties from      (     x      y     )   =     sin   (   y  π   )     sin   (   x  π   )      (       -  y   -  1         -  x   -  1      )    =     sin   (    (   x  -  y   )   π   )     sin   (   x  π   )      (      y  -  x  -  1       y     )     ;         binomial  x  y           y  π        x  π      binomial      y   1       x   1                    x  y   π        x  π      binomial    y  x  1   y       {x\choose y}=\frac{\sin(y\pi)}{\sin(x\pi)}{-y-1\choose-x-1}=\frac{\sin((x-y)%
 \pi)}{\sin(x\pi)}{y-x-1\choose y};   :         (     x      y     )   ⋅   (     y      x     )    =    sin   (    (   x  -  y   )   π   )      (   x  -  y   )   π     .       normal-⋅   binomial  x  y    binomial  y  x            x  y   π        x  y   π      {x\choose y}\cdot{y\choose x}=\frac{\sin((x-y)\pi)}{(x-y)\pi}.   moreover,       (       n      m       )   =   (       n       n  -  m        )        binomial  n  m    binomial  n    n  m      \textstyle{{n\choose m}={n\choose n-m}}     The resulting function has been little-studied, apparently first being graphed in . Notably, many binomial identities fail     (       -  n       m      )   =   (       -  n         -  n   -  m       )        binomial    n   m    binomial    n       n   m      \textstyle{{-n\choose m}={-n\choose-n-m}}   but    -  n      n    -n   for n positive (so    y  =  x      y  x    y=x   negative). The behavior is quite complex, and markedly different in various octants (that is, with respect to the x and y axes and the line    0  ≤  y  ≤  x        0  y       x     0\leq y\leq x   ), with the behavior for negative x having singularities at negative integer values and a checkerboard of positive and negative regions:   in the octant    0  ≤  x  ≤  y        0  x       y     0\leq x\leq y   it is a smoothly interpolated form of the usual binomial, with a ridge ("Pascal's ridge").  in the octant     x  ≥  0   ,   y  ≤  0      formulae-sequence    x  0     y  0     x\geq 0,y\leq 0   and in the quadrant     x  ≤  0   ,   y  ≥  0      formulae-sequence    x  0     y  0     x\leq 0,y\geq 0   the function is close to zero.  in the quadrant     (   -  n   ,   m  +  1   )   ,   (   -  n   ,  m  )   ,   (    -  n   -  1   ,   m  -  1   )   ,   (    -  n   -  1   ,  m  )         n     m  1       n   m        n   1     m  1         n   1   m     (-n,m+1),(-n,m),(-n-1,m-1),(-n-1,m)   the function is alternatingly very large positive and negative on the parallelograms with vertices    0  >  x  >  y        0  x       y     0>x>y     in the octant     -  1   >  y  >   x  +  1           1   y         x  1      -1>y>x+1   the behavior is again alternatingly very large positive and negative, but on a square grid.  in the octant     (     α      β     )   =   |   {   B  ⊆  A   :    |  B  |   =  β   }   |        binomial  α  β      conditional-set    B  A       B   β       {\alpha\choose\beta}=|\{B\subseteq A:|B|=\beta\}|   it is close to zero, except for near the singularities.   Generalization to q -series  The binomial coefficient has a q-analog generalization known as the Gaussian binomial coefficient .  Generalization to infinite cardinals  The definition of the binomial coefficient can be generalized to infinite cardinals by defining:     α   α   \alpha     where A is some set with cardinality    α   α   \alpha   . One can show that the generalized binomial coefficient is well-defined, in the sense that no matter what set we choose to represent the cardinal number    (      α      β      )     binomial  α  β    {\alpha\choose\beta}   ,     (      α      α      )   =   2  α        binomial  α  α    superscript  2  α     {\alpha\choose\alpha}=2^{\alpha}   will remain the same. For finite cardinals, this definition coincides with the standard definition of the binomial coefficient.  Assuming the Axiom of Choice , one can show that   α   α   \alpha   for any infinite cardinal    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {n\choose k}   .  Binomial coefficient in programming languages  The notation     (     n       k  +  1      )   =     n  -  k    k  +  1     (     n      k     )         binomial  n    k  1          n  k     k  1     binomial  n  k      {n\choose k+1}=\frac{n-k}{k+1}{n\choose k}   is convenient in handwriting but inconvenient for typewriters and computer terminals . Many programming languages do not offer a standard subroutine for computing the binomial coefficient, but for example both the APL programming language and the (related) J programming language use the exclamation mark: k ! n .  Naive implementations of the factorial formula, such as the following snippet in Python :  from math import factorial def binomialCoefficient(n, k): return factorial(n) // (factorial(k) * factorial(n - k))  are very slow and are useless for calculating factorials of very high numbers (in languages such as C or Java they suffer from overflow errors because of this reason). A direct implementation of the multiplicative formula works well:  def binomialCoefficient(n, k): if k <  0  or k > n: return  0  if k ==  0  or k == n: return  1 k =  min (k, n - k) # take advantage of symmetry c =  1  for i in  range (k):
         c = c * (n - i) / (i +  1 ) return c  (In Python, range(k) produces a list from 0 to k-1.)  Pascal's rule provides a recursive definition which can also be implemented in Python , although it is less efficient:  def binomialCoefficient(n, k): if k <  0  or k > n: return  0  if k > n - k: # take advantage of symmetry k = n - k if k ==  0  or n <=  1 : return  1  return binomialCoefficient(n -1 , k) + binomialCoefficient(n -1 , k -1 )  The example mentioned above can be also written in functional style. The following Scheme example uses the recursive definition       (     n       k  +  1      )   =    [    (   n  -  k   )    (     n      k     )    ]   ÷   (   k  +  1   )         binomial  n    k  1       delimited-[]      n  k    binomial  n  k       k  1      {n\choose k+1}=\left[(n-k){n\choose k}\right]\div(k+1)   Rational arithmetic can be easily avoided using integer division        (     n      k     )   =    n  !     k  !     (   n  -  k   )   !     =    Γ   (   n  +  1   )     Γ   (   k  +  1   )   Γ   (    n  -  k   +  1   )     =   exp   (     ln  Γ    (   n  +  1   )    -    ln  Γ    (   k  +  1   )    -    ln  Γ    (    n  -  k   +  1   )     )     ,         binomial  n  k       n       k       n  k               normal-Γ    n  1      normal-Γ    k  1   normal-Γ      n  k   1                  normal-Γ     n  1        normal-Γ     k  1        normal-Γ       n  k   1         {n\choose k}=\frac{n!}{k!\,(n-k)!}=\frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(k+1)\,\Gamma(n-k+%
 1)}=\exp(\ln\Gamma(n+1)-\ln\Gamma(k+1)-\ln\Gamma(n-k+1)),   The following implementation uses all these ideas  ( define  (binomial n k) ;; Helper function to compute C(n,k) via forward recursion ( define  (binomial-iter n k i prev)
     ( if ( >= i k)
       prev
      (binomial-iter n k ( + i 1 ) ( / (* ( - n i) prev) ( + i 1 ))))) ;; Use symmetry property C(n,k)=C(n, n-k) ( if ( < k ( - n k))
     (binomial-iter n k 0  1 )
     (binomial-iter n ( - n k) 0  1 )))  Another way to compute the binomial coefficient when using large numbers is to recognize that     ln     \ln     where    Γ   (  n  )       normal-Γ  n    \Gamma(n)      n   n   n   denotes the natural logarithm of the gamma function at     (      n      k      )   =  0       binomial  n  k   0    {\textstyle\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}=0   . It is a special function that is easily computed and is standard in some programming languages such as using log_gamma in Maxima , LogGamma in Mathematica , gammaln in MATLAB , or lgamma in R . Roundoff error may cause the returned value to not be an integer.
