It is called paracompact because it has infinite cells . Each cell consists of a hexagonal tiling whose vertices lie on a horosphere : a flat plane in hyperbolic space that approaches a single ideal point at infinity.  The Schläfli symbol of the hexagonal tiling honeycomb is {6,3,6}. Since that of the hexagonal tiling of the plane is {6,3}, this honeycomb has six such hexagonal tilings meeting at each edge. Since the Schläfli symbol of the triangular tiling is {3,6}, the vertex figure of this honeycomb is a triangular tiling. Thus, infinitely many hexagonal tilings meet at each vertex of this honeycomb. 1   Images  It is analogous to the 2D hyperbolic infinite-order apeirogonal tiling , {∞,∞} with infinite apeirogonal faces and with all vertices are on the ideal surface.      This honeycomb contains ,  that tile 2- hypercycle surfaces, similar to thes paracompact tilings, , :      Symmetry  (Figure)  Subgroup relations: ↔   This honeycomb has a half symmetry construction is , which looks identical by cells and needs faces colored by their symmetry position to be distinct. Another lower symmetry, [6,3 * ,6], index 6 exists with a nonsimplex fundamental domain.
