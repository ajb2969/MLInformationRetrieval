   Meissel–Mertens constant      Meissel–Mertens constant   [ constant definition.svg|thumb|300px|In the limit, the sum of the reciprocals of the primes M = \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty } \left( \sum_{p \leq n} \frac{1}{p} - \ln(\ln(n)) \right)=\gamma + \sum_{p} \left[ \ln\! \left( 1 - \frac{1}{p} \right) + \frac{1}{p} \right .  Here γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant , which has an analogous definition involving a sum over all integers (not just the primes).  The value of M is approximately   M ≈ 0.2614972128476427837554268386086958590516... .   Mertens' second theorem establishes that the limit exists.  The fact that there are two logarithms (log of a log) in the limit for the Meissel–Mertens constant may be thought of as a consequence of the combination of the prime number theorem and the limit of the Euler–Mascheroni constant.  In popular culture  The Meisel-Mertens constant was used by Google when bidding in the Nortel patent auction. Google posted three bids based on mathematical numbers: $1,902,160,540 ( Brun's constant ), $2,614,972,128 (Meissel–Mertens constant), and $3.14159 billion ( π ). 1  See also   Divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes  Prime zeta function   References  External links    On the remainder in a series of Mertens (postscript file)   "  Category:Mathematical constants     ↩
