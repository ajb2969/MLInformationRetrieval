   Multiplicative function      Multiplicative function    Outside number theory, the term multiplicative function is usually used for completely multiplicative functions . This article discusses number theoretic multiplicative functions.    In number theory , a multiplicative function is an arithmetic function  f ( n ) of the positive integer  n with the property that f (1) = 1 and whenever a and b are coprime , then   f ( ab ) = f ( a ) f ( b ).   An arithmetic function f ( n ) is said to be completely multiplicative (or totally multiplicative ) if f (1) = 1 and f ( ab ) = f ( a ) f ( b ) holds for all positive integers a and b , even when they are not coprime.  Examples  Some multiplicative functions are defined to make formulas easier to write:   1( n ): the constant function, defined by 1( n ) = 1 (completely multiplicative)         1  C    (  n  )        subscript  1  C   n    1_{C}(n)   the indicator function of the set    C  ‚äÇ  ‚Ñ§      C  ‚Ñ§    C\subset\mathbb{Z}   . This is multiplicative if the set C has the property that if a and b are in C , gcd( a , b )=1, then ab is also in C. This is the case if C is the set of squares, cubes, or higher powers, or if C is the set of square-free numbers.    Id( n ): identity function , defined by Id( n ) = n (completely multiplicative)    Id k ( n ): the power functions, defined by Id k ( n ) = n k for any complex number k (completely multiplicative). As special cases we have  Id 0 ( n ) = 1( n ) and  Id 1 ( n ) = Id( n ).        œµ   œµ   \epsilon   ( n ): the function defined by   œµ   œµ   \epsilon   ( n ) = 1 if n = 1 and 0 otherwise, sometimes called multiplication unit for Dirichlet convolution or simply the unit function ; the Kronecker delta Œ¥ i n ; sometimes written as u ( n ), not to be confused with   Œº   Œº   \mu   ( n ) (completely multiplicative).   Other examples of multiplicative functions include many functions of importance in number theory, such as:   gcd( n , k ): the greatest common divisor of n and k , as a function of n , where k is a fixed integer.       œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   ( n ): Euler's totient function    œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   , counting the positive integers coprime to (but not bigger than) n       Œº   Œº   \mu   ( n ): the M√∂bius function , the parity (‚àí1 for odd, +1 for even) of the number of prime factors of square-free numbers; 0 if n is not square-free       œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    k ( n ): the divisor function , which is the sum of the k -th powers of all the positive divisors of n (where k may be any complex number ). Special cases we have     œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    0 ( n ) = d ( n ) the number of positive divisors of n ,     œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    1 ( n ) =   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   ( n ), the sum of all the positive divisors of n .         a   (  n  )       a  n    a(n)   : the number of non-isomorphic abelian groups of order n.       Œª   Œª   \lambda   ( n ): the Liouville function , Œª( n ) = (‚àí1) Œ©( n ) where Œ©( n ) is the total number of primes (counted with multiplicity) dividing n . (completely multiplicative).       Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   ( n ), defined by   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   ( n ) = (‚àí1)    œâ   œâ   \omega   (n) , where the additive function    œâ   œâ   \omega   ( n ) is the number of distinct primes dividing n .    All Dirichlet characters are completely multiplicative functions. For example  ( n / p ), the Legendre symbol , considered as a function of n where p is a fixed prime number .    An example of a non-multiplicative function is the arithmetic function r 2 ( n ) - the number of representations of n as a sum of squares of two integers, positive , negative , or zero , where in counting the number of ways, reversal of order is allowed. For example:   1 = 1 2 + 0 2 = (-1) 2 + 0 2 = 0 2 + 1 2 = 0 2 + (-1) 2    and therefore r 2 (1) = 4 ‚â† 1. This shows that the function is not multiplicative. However, r 2 ( n )/4 is multiplicative.  In the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences , sequences of values of a multiplicative function have the keyword "mult".  See arithmetic function for some other examples of non-multiplicative functions.  Properties  A multiplicative function is completely determined by its values at the powers of prime numbers , a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . Thus, if n is a product of powers of distinct primes, say n = p a  q b ..., then f ( n ) = f ( p a ) f ( q b ) ...  This property of multiplicative functions significantly reduces the need for computation, as in the following examples for n = 144 = 2 4 ¬∑ 3 2 :   d(144) =   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    0 (144) =   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    0 (2 4 )   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    0 (3 2 ) = (1 0 + 2 0 + 4 0 + 8 0 + 16 0 )(1 0 + 3 0 + 9 0 ) = 5 ¬∑ 3 = 15,     œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   (144) =   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    1 (144) =   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    1 (2 4 )   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    1 (3 2 ) = (1 1 + 2 1 + 4 1 + 8 1 + 16 1 )(1 1 + 3 1 + 9 1 ) = 31 ¬∑ 13 = 403,     œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    * (144) =   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    * (2 4 )   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    * (3 2 ) = (1 1 + 16 1 )(1 1 + 9 1 ) = 17 ¬∑ 10 = 170.   Similarly, we have:     œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   (144)=   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   (2 4 )   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   (3 2 ) = 8 ¬∑ 6 = 48  In general, if f ( n ) is a multiplicative function and a , b are any two positive integers, then   f ( a ) ¬∑ f ( b ) = f ( gcd ( a , b )) ¬∑ f ( lcm ( a , b )).   Every completely multiplicative function is a homomorphism of monoids and is completely determined by its restriction to the prime numbers.  Convolution  If f and g are two multiplicative functions, one defines a new multiplicative function f * g , the Dirichlet convolution of f and g , by        (    f   *  g   )    (  n  )    =    ‚àë   d  |  n     f   (  d  )   g   (   n  d   )             f  g   n     subscript    fragments  d  normal-|  n      f  d  g    n  d       (f\,*\,g)(n)=\sum_{d|n}f(d)\,g\left(\frac{n}{d}\right)   where the sum extends over all positive divisors d of n . With this operation, the set of all multiplicative functions turns into an abelian group ; the identity element is   œµ   œµ   \epsilon   . Convolution is commutative, associative, and distributive over addition.  Relations among the multiplicative functions discussed above include:      Œº   Œº   \mu   * 1 =   œµ   œµ   \epsilon   (the M√∂bius inversion formula )  (   Œº   Œº   \mu   Id k ) * Id k =   œµ   œµ   \epsilon   (generalized M√∂bius inversion)     œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   * 1 = Id  d = 1 * 1     œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   = Id * 1 =   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   * d     œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    k = Id k * 1  Id =   œÜ   œÜ   \varphi   * 1 =   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   *   Œº   Œº   \mu     Id k =   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma    k *   Œº   Œº   \mu      The Dirichlet convolution can be defined for general arithmetic functions, and yields a ring structure, the Dirichlet ring .

Multiplicative function over  Let A = , the polynomial ring over the finite field with q elements. A is principal ideal domain and therefore A is unique factorization domain .  a complex-valued function   Œª   Œª   \lambda   on A is called multiplicative if     Œª   (   f  g   )    =   Œª   (  f  )   Œª   (  g  )          Œª    f  g      Œª  f  Œª  g     \lambda(fg)=\lambda(f)\lambda(g)   , whenever f and g are relatively prime .  Zeta function and Dirichlet series in  Let h be a polynomial arithmetic function (i.e. a function on set of monic polynomials over A ). Its corresponding Dirichlet series define to be        D  h    (  s  )    =    ‚àë   f  monic     h   (  f  )     |  f  |    -  s             subscript  D  h   s     subscript     f  monic      h  f   superscript    f     s        D_{h}(s)=\sum_{f\text{ monic}}h(f)|f|^{-s}   ,  where for    g  ‚àà  A      g  A    g\in A   , set     |  g  |   =   q   d  e  g   (  g  )           g    superscript  q    d  e  g  g      |g|=q^{deg(g)}   if    g  ‚â†  0      g  0    g\neq 0   , and     |  g  |   =  0        g   0    |g|=0   otherwise.  The polynomial zeta function is then        Œ∂  A    (  s  )    =    ‚àë   f  monic      |  f  |    -  s            subscript  Œ∂  A   s     subscript     f  monic     superscript    f     s       \zeta_{A}(s)=\sum_{f\text{ monic}}|f|^{-s}   .  Similar to the situation in   ùêç   ùêç   \mathbf{N}   , every Dirichlet series of a multiplicative function  h has a product representation (Euler product):        D  h    (  s  )    =    ‚àè  P    (    ‚àë   n   =  0    ‚àû    h   (   P  n   )     |  P  |    -   s  n       )           subscript  D  h   s     subscript  product  P     superscript   subscript     n    0         h   superscript  P  n    superscript    P       s  n          D_{h}(s)=\prod_{P}(\sum_{n\mathop{=}0}^{\infty}h(P^{n})|P|^{-sn})   ,  Where the product runs over all monic irreducible polynomials P .  For example, the product representation of the zeta function is as for the integers      Œ∂  A    (  s  )    =    ‚àè  P     (   1  -    |  P  |    -  s     )    -  1            subscript  Œ∂  A   s     subscript  product  P    superscript    1   superscript    P     s       1       \zeta_{A}(s)=\prod_{P}(1-|P|^{-s})^{-1}   .  Unlike the classical zeta function ,     Œ∂  A    (  s  )        subscript  Œ∂  A   s    \zeta_{A}(s)   is a simple rational function:        Œ∂  A    (  s  )    =    ‚àë  f    (    |  f  |    -  s    )    =    ‚àë  n     ‚àë  deg(f)=n    q   -   s  n       =    ‚àë  n    (   q   n  -   s  n     )    =    (   1  -   q   1  -  s     )    -  1             subscript  Œ∂  A   s     subscript   f    superscript    f     s            subscript   n     subscript   deg(f)=n    superscript  q      s  n              subscript   n    superscript  q    n    s  n            superscript    1   superscript  q    1  s       1       \zeta_{A}(s)=\sum_{f}(|f|^{-s})=\sum_{n}\sum_{\text{deg(f)=n}}q^{-sn}=\sum_{n}%
 (q^{n-sn})=(1-q^{1-s})^{-1}   .  In a similar way, If ∆í and g are two polynomial arithmetic functions, one defines ∆í * g , the Dirichlet convolution of ∆í and g , by       (   f  *  g   )    (  m  )         f  g   m    \displaystyle(f*g)(m)     where the sum extends over all monic divisors  d of m , or equivalently over all pairs ( a , b ) of monic polynomials whose product is m . The identity      D  h    D  g    =   D   h  *  g           subscript  D  h    subscript  D  g     subscript  D    h  g      D_{h}D_{g}=D_{h*g}   still holds.
