   Douglas' lemma      Douglas' lemma   In operator theory , an area of mathematics, Douglas' lemma relates factorization , range inclusion, and majorization of Hilbert space operators. It is generally attributed to Ronald G. Douglas , although Douglas acknowledges that aspects of the result may already have been known. The statement of the result is as follows:  Theorem : If A and B are bounded operators on a Hilbert space H , the following are equivalent:         im   (  A  )    ⊆   im   (  B  )     .        im  A     im  B     \text{im}(A)\subseteq\text{im}(B).\,          A   A  *    ≤    λ  2   B   B  *          A   superscript  A        superscript  λ  2   B   superscript  B       AA^{*}\leq\lambda^{2}BB^{*}   for some    λ  ≥   0.       λ  0.    \lambda\geq 0.\,     There exists a bounded operator C on H such that A = BC .   Moreover, if these equivalent conditions hold, then there is a unique operator C such that          ∥  C  ∥   2   =   inf   {  μ  :    A   A  *    ≤   μ  B   B  *     }     .       superscript   norm  C   2    infimum   conditional-set  μ      A   superscript  A       μ  B   superscript  B          \|C\|^{2}=\inf\{\mu:\,AA^{*}\leq\mu BB^{*}\}.     ker( A ) = ker( C )       im   (  C  )    ⊆    im   (   B  *   )    ¯         im  C    normal-¯    im   superscript  B        \text{im}(C)\subseteq\overline{\text{im}(B^{*})}      A generalization of Douglas' lemma for unbounded operators on a Banach space is given in. 1  See also  Positive operator  References   Douglas, R.G.: "On Majorization, Factorization, and Range Inclusion of Operators on Hilbert Space".
