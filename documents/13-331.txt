   Kemnitz's conjecture      Kemnitz's conjecture   In additive number theory , Kemnitz's conjecture states that every set of lattice points in the plane has a large subset whose centroid is also a lattice point. It was proved independently in the autumn of 2003 by Christian Reiher and Carlos di Fiore .  The exact formulation of this conjecture is as follows:   Let   n   n   n   be a natural number and   S   S   S   a set of 4 n − 3 lattice points in plane. Then there exists a subset     S  1   ⊆  S       subscript  S  1   S    S_{1}\subseteq S   with   n   n   n   points such that the centroid of all points from    S  1     subscript  S  1    S_{1}   is also a lattice point.   Kemnitz's conjecture was formulated in 1983 by Arnfried Kemnitz as a generalization of the Erdős–Ginzburg–Ziv theorem , an analogous one-dimensional result stating that every 2 n − 1 integers have a subset of size n whose average is an integer. In 2000, Lajos Rónyai proved a weakened form of Kemnitz's conjecture for sets with 4 n − 2 lattice points. Then, in 2003, Christian Reiher proved the full conjecture using the Chevalley–Warning theorem .
