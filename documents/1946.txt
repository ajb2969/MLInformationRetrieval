   Ganea conjecture      Ganea conjecture   Ganea's conjecture is a claim in algebraic topology , now disproved. It states that        cat   (   X  ×   S  n    )    =    cat   (  X  )    +  1    ,   n  >  0      formulae-sequence      cat    X   superscript  S  n         cat  X   1      n  0     \text{cat}(X\times S^{n})=\text{cat}(X)+1,n>0\,\!   where cat( X ) is the Lusternik–Schnirelmann category of a topological space  X , and S n is the n dimensional sphere .  The inequality       cat   (   X  ×  Y   )    ≤    cat   (  X  )    +   cat   (  Y  )           cat    X  Y        cat  X     cat  Y      \text{cat}(X\times Y)\leq\text{cat}(X)+\text{cat}(Y)   holds for any pair of spaces, X and Y . Furthermore, cat( S n )=1, for any sphere S n , n >0. Thus, the conjecture amounts to cat( X × S n ) ≥ cat( X ) + 1.  The conjecture was formulated by Tudor Ganea in 1971. Many particular cases of this conjecture were proved, till finally Norio Iwase gave a counterexample in 1998. In a follow-up paper from 2002, Iwase gave an even stronger counterexample, with X a closed, smooth manifold . This counterexample also disproved a related conjecture, stating that        cat   (   M  -  p   )    =    cat   (  M  )    -  1    ,        cat    M  p        cat  M   1     \text{cat}(M-{p})=\text{cat}(M)-1,   for a closed manifold M and p a point in M .  This work raises the question: For which spaces X is the Ganea condition, cat( X × S n ) = cat( X ) + 1, satisfied? It has been conjectured that these are precisely the spaces X for which cat( X ) equals a related invariant, Qcat( X ).
