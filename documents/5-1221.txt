   Fodor's lemma      Fodor's lemma   In mathematics , particularly in set theory , Fodor's lemma states the following:  If   κ   κ   \kappa   is a regular , uncountable  cardinal ,   S   S   S   is a stationary subset of   κ   κ   \kappa   , and    f  :   S  →  κ      normal-:  f   normal-→  S  κ     f:S\rightarrow\kappa   is regressive (that is,     f   (  α  )    <  α        f  α   α    f(\alpha)<\alpha   for any    α  ∈  S      α  S    \alpha\in S   ,    α  ≠  0      α  0    \alpha\neq 0   ) then there is some   γ   γ   \gamma   and some stationary     S  0   ⊆  S       subscript  S  0   S    S_{0}\subseteq S   such that     f   (  α  )    =  γ        f  α   γ    f(\alpha)=\gamma   for any    α  ∈   S  0       α   subscript  S  0     \alpha\in S_{0}   . In modern parlance, the nonstationary ideal is normal .  Proof  We can assume that    0  ∉  S      0  S    0\notin S   (by removing 0, if necessary). If Fodor's lemma is false, for every    α  <  κ      α  κ    \alpha<\kappa   there is some club set     C  α     subscript  C  α    C_{\alpha}   such that      C  α   ∩    f   -  1     (  α  )     =  ∅         subscript  C  α      superscript  f    1    α       C_{\alpha}\cap f^{-1}(\alpha)=\emptyset   . Let    C  =    Δ   α  <  κ     C  α        C     subscript  normal-Δ    α  κ     subscript  C  α      C=\Delta_{\alpha<\kappa}C_{\alpha}   . The club sets are closed under diagonal intersection , so   C   C   C   is also club and therefore there is some    α  ∈   S  ∩  C       α    S  C     \alpha\in S\cap C   . Then    α  ∈   C  β       α   subscript  C  β     \alpha\in C_{\beta}   for each    β  <  α      β  α    \beta<\alpha   , and so there can be no    β  <  α      β  α    \beta<\alpha   such that    α  ∈    f   -  1     (  β  )        α     superscript  f    1    β     \alpha\in f^{-1}(\beta)   , so     f   (  α  )    ≥  α        f  α   α    f(\alpha)\geq\alpha   , a contradiction .  The lemma was first proved by the Hungarian set theorist, Géza Fodor in 1956. It is sometimes also called "The Pressing Down Lemma".  Fodor's lemma also holds for Thomas Jech 's notion of stationary sets as well as for the general notion of stationary set.  Fodor's lemma for trees  Another related statement, also known as Fodor's lemma (or Pressing-Down-lemma), is the following:  For every non-special tree   T   T   T   and regressive mapping    f  :   T  →  T      normal-:  f   normal-→  T  T     f:T\rightarrow T   (that is,    t  ∈  T      t  T    t\in T   , for every    S  ⊂  T      S  T    S\subset T   ), there is a non-special subtree   f   f   f   on which $f$ is constant.
