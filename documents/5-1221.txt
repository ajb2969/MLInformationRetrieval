Fodor's lemma

In mathematics, particularly in set theory, Fodor's lemma states the following:
If 
 
 
 
  is a regular, uncountable cardinal, 
 
 
 
  is a stationary subset of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is regressive (that is, 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ) then there is some 
 
 
 
  and some stationary 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 . In modern parlance, the nonstationary ideal is normal.
Proof
We can assume that 
 
 
 
  (by removing 0, if necessary). If Fodor's lemma is false, for every 
 
 
 
  there is some club set

 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 . The club sets are closed under diagonal intersection, so 
 
 
 
  is also club and therefore there is some 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
 , and so there can be no 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 , a contradiction.
The lemma was first proved by the Hungarian set theorist, GÃ©za Fodor in 1956. It is sometimes also called "The Pressing Down Lemma".
Fodor's lemma also holds for Thomas Jech's notion of stationary sets as well as for the general notion of stationary set.
Fodor's lemma for trees
Another related statement, also known as Fodor's lemma (or Pressing-Down-lemma), is the following:
For every non-special tree 
 
 
 
  and regressive mapping 
 
 
 
  (that is, 
 
 
 
 , for every 
 
 
 
 ), there is a non-special subtree 
 
 
 
  on which $f$ is constant.
