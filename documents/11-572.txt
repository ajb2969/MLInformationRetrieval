Wax-ester hydrolase

In enzymology, a wax-ester hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a wax ester + H2O 
 
 
 
  a long-chain alcohol + a long-chain carboxylate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are wax ester and H2O, whereas its two products are long-chain alcohol and long-chain carboxylate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is wax-ester acylhydrolase. Other names in common use include jojoba wax esterase, and WEH.
