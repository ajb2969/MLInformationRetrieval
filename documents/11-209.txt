   Glycerol dehydratase      Glycerol dehydratase   In enzymology , a glycerol dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   glycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxypropanal + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , glycerol , and two products , 3-hydroxypropanal and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycerol hydro-lyase (3-hydroxypropanol-forming) . Other names in common use include glycerol dehydrase , and glycerol hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism . It employs one cofactor , cobalamin .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
