   Born rule      Born rule    Not to be confused with the Cauchy–Born rule in crystal mechanics.    The Born rule (also called the Born law , Born's rule , or Born's law ) is a law of quantum mechanics which gives the probability that a measurement on a quantum system will yield a given result. It is named after its originator, the physicist Max Born . The Born rule is one of the key principles of quantum mechanics. There have been many attempts to derive the Born rule from the other assumptions of quantum mechanics , with inconclusive results; for example while it has been claimed that Born's law can be derived from the Many Worlds Interpretation the proofs have been criticized as circular. 1 However, within the Quantum Bayesianism interpretation of quantum theory, it has been shown to be an extension of the standard Law of Total Probability , which takes into account the Hilbert space dimension of the physical system involved. 2 The Born rule can however be derived in the ambit of so-called Hidden-Measurements Interpretation of quantum mechanics, by averaging over all possible measurement-interactions that can take place between the quantum entity and the measuring system. 3 4  The rule  The Born rule states that if an observable corresponding to a Hermitian operator    A   A   A   with discrete spectrum is measured in a system with normalized wave function     |  ψ   \rang      fragments  normal-|  ψ  \rang    \scriptstyle|\psi\rang   ( see  bra–ket notation ), then   the measured result will be one of the eigenvalues    λ   λ   \lambda   of   A   A   A   , and  the probability of measuring a given eigenvalue    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   will equal     \lang   ψ   |   P  i   |   ψ   \rang       \lang  ψ     subscript  P  i    ψ  \rang    \scriptstyle\lang\psi|P_{i}|\psi\rang   , where    P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   is the projection onto the eigenspace of   A   A   A   corresponding to    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   .    (In the case where the eigenspace of   A   A   A   corresponding to    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   is one-dimensional and spanned by the normalized eigenvector    |   λ  i    \rang      fragments  normal-|   subscript  λ  i   \rang    \scriptstyle|\lambda_{i}\rang   ,    P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   is equal to    |    λ  i    \rang    \lang    λ  i    |         subscript  λ  i   \rang  \lang   subscript  λ  i      \scriptstyle|\lambda_{i}\rang\lang\lambda_{i}|   , so the probability     \lang   ψ   |   P  i   |   ψ   \rang       \lang  ψ     subscript  P  i    ψ  \rang    \scriptstyle\lang\psi|P_{i}|\psi\rang   is equal to     \lang   ψ   |    λ  i    \rang    \lang    λ  i    |   ψ   \rang       \lang  ψ       subscript  λ  i   \rang  \lang   subscript  λ  i     ψ  \rang    \scriptstyle\lang\psi|\lambda_{i}\rang\lang\lambda_{i}|\psi\rang   . Since the complex number      \lang    λ  i   |  ψ   \rang      fragments  \lang   subscript  λ  i   normal-|  ψ  \rang    \scriptstyle\lang\lambda_{i}|\psi\rang   is known as the probability amplitude that the state vector    |  ψ   \rang      fragments  normal-|  ψ  \rang    \scriptstyle|\psi\rang   assigns to the eigenvector    |   λ  i    \rang      fragments  normal-|   subscript  λ  i   \rang    \scriptstyle|\lambda_{i}\rang   , it is common to describe the Born rule as telling us that probability is equal to the amplitude-squared (really the amplitude times its own complex conjugate ). Equivalently, the probability can be written as    |   \lang    λ  i   |  ψ   \rang    |  2      fragments  normal-|  \lang   subscript  λ  i   normal-|  ψ  \rang   superscript  normal-|  2     \scriptstyle|\lang\lambda_{i}|\psi\rang|^{2}   .)   In the case where the spectrum of   A   A   A   is not wholly discrete, the spectral theorem proves the existence of a certain projection-valued measure    Q   Q   Q   , the spectral measure of   A   A   A   . In this case,   the probability that the result of the measurement lies in a measurable set   M   M   M   will be given by     \lang   ψ   |   Q   (  M  )    |   ψ   \rang       \lang  ψ      Q  M    ψ  \rang    \scriptstyle\lang\psi|Q(M)|\psi\rang   .   If we are given a wave function   ψ   ψ   \scriptstyle\psi   for a single structureless particle in position space, this reduces to saying that the probability density function    p   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )       p   x  y  z     p(x,y,z)   for a measurement of the position at time    t  0     subscript  t  0    t_{0}   will be given by     p   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =         p   x  y  z    absent    p(x,y,z)=         |   ψ   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ,   t  0   )    |   2   .     superscript      ψ   x  y  z   subscript  t  0      2    \scriptstyle|\psi(x,y,z,t_{0})|^{2}.     History  The Born rule was formulated by Born in a 1926 paper. 5 In this paper, Born solves the Schrödinger equation for a scattering problem and, inspired by Einstein's work on the photoelectric effect, 6 concluded, in a footnote, that the Born rule gives the only possible interpretation of the solution. In 1954, together with Walther Bothe , Born was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for this and other work. 7  John von Neumann discussed the application of spectral theory to Born's rule in his 1932 book. 8  See also   Quantum non-equilibrium  Gleason's theorem  Transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics  Hidden-measurements interpretation of quantum mechanics   References  External links   Quantum Mechanics Not in Jeopardy: Physicists Confirm a Decades-Old Key Principle Experimentally ScienceDaily (July 23, 2010)   "  Category:Quantum measurement     N.P.
