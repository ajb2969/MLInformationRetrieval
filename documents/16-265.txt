D-alanine—(R)-lactate ligase

D-alanine—(R)-lactate ligase (, VanA, VanB, VanD) is an enzyme with system name D-alanine:(R)-lactate ligase (ADP-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-alanine + (R)-lactate + ATP $\rightleftharpoons$ D-alanyl-(R)-lactate + ADP + phosphate


The product of this enzyme can be incorporated into the peptidoglycan pentapeptide instead of the usual D-alanyl-D-alanine dipeptide.
