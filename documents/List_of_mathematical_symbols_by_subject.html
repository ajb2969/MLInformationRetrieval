<h1>List of mathematical symbols by subject</h1>
<hr/>

<p>This <strong>list of mathematical symbols by subject</strong> shows a selection of the most common symbols that are used in modern mathematical notation within formulas, grouped by mathematical topic. As it is virtually impossible to list all the symbols ever used in mathematics, only those symbols which occur often in mathematics or mathematics education are included. Many of the characters are standardized, for example in DIN 1302 <em>General mathematical symbols</em> or <a href="ISO_80000-2" title="wikilink">DIN EN ISO 80000-2 <em>Quantities and units â€“ Part 2: Mathematical signs for science and technology</em></a>.</p>

<p>The following list is largely limited to non-alphanumeric characters. It is divided by areas of mathematics and grouped within sub-regions. Some symbols have a different meaning depending on the context and appear accordingly several times in the list. Further information on the symbols and their meaning can be found in the respective linked articles.</p>

<p>The following information is provided for each mathematical symbol:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symbol:</strong> The symbol as it is represented by <a class="uri" href="LaTeX" title="wikilink">LaTeX</a>. If there are several typographic variants, only one of the variants is shown.</li>
<li><strong>Usage:</strong> An exemplary use of the symbol in a formula. Letters here stand as a placeholder for numbers, variables or complex expressions. Different possible applications are listed separately.</li>
<li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> A short textual description of the meaning of the formula in the previous column.</li>
<li><strong>Article:</strong> The Wikipedia article that discusses the meaning (semantics) of the symbol.</li>
<li><strong>LaTeX:</strong> The <a class="uri" href="LaTeX" title="wikilink">LaTeX</a> command that creates the icon. Characters from the <a class="uri" href="ASCII" title="wikilink">ASCII</a> character set can be used directly, with a few exceptions (pound sign #, backslash \, braces {}, and percent sign %). High-and low-position is indicated via the characters ^ and _ and is not explicitly specified.</li>
<li><strong>HTML:</strong> The icon in <a class="uri" href="HTML" title="wikilink">HTML</a>, if it is defined as a named mark. Non-named characters can be indicated in the form can </li></ul></body></html>
