   Courant algebroid      Courant algebroid  In a field of [[mathematics]] known as [[differential geometry]], a '''Courant algebroid''' is a structure which, in a certain sense, blends the co ncepts of Lie algebroid and of quadratic Lie algebra . This notion, which plays a fundamental role in the study of Hitchin's generalized complex structures , was originally introduced by Zhang-Ju Liu, Alan Weinstein and Ping Xu in their investigation of doubles of Lie bialgebroids in 1997. 1 Liu, Weinstein and Xu named it after Courant , who had implicitly devised earlier in 1990 2 the standard prototype of Courant algebroid through his discovery of a skew symmetric bracket on     T  M   ⊕    T  *   M      direct-sum    T  M      superscript  T    M     TM\oplus T^{*}M   , called Courant bracket today, which fails to satisfy the Jacobi identity. Both this standard example and the double of a Lie bialgebra are special instances of Courant algebroids.  Definition  A Courant algebroid consists of the data a vector bundle    E  →  M     normal-→  E  M    E\to M   with a bracket     [  .  ,  .  ]   :  Γ  E  ×  Γ  E  →  Γ  E     fragments   fragments  normal-[  normal-.  normal-,  normal-.  normal-]   normal-:  Γ  E   Γ  E  normal-→  Γ  E    [.,.]:\Gamma E\times\Gamma E\to\Gamma E   , a non degenerate fiber-wise inner product     ⟨  .  ,  .  ⟩   :  E  ×  E  →  M  ×   \R      fragments   fragments  normal-⟨  normal-.  normal-,  normal-.  normal-⟩   normal-:  E   E  normal-→  M   \R    \langle.,.\rangle:E\times E\to M\times\R   , and a bundle map    ρ  :   E  →   T  M       normal-:  ρ   normal-→  E    T  M      \rho:E\to TM   subject to the following axioms,       [  ϕ  ,   [  χ  ,  ψ  ]   ]   =    [   [  ϕ  ,  χ  ]   ,  ψ  ]   +   [  χ  ,   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   ]         ϕ   χ  ψ        ϕ  χ   ψ    χ   ϕ  ψ       [\phi,[\chi,\psi]]=[[\phi,\chi],\psi]+[\chi,[\phi,\psi]]          [  ϕ  ,   f  ψ   ]   =    ρ   (  ϕ  )   f  ψ   +   f   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]          ϕ    f  ψ        ρ  ϕ  f  ψ     f   ϕ  ψ       [\phi,f\psi]=\rho(\phi)f\psi+f[\phi,\psi]          [  ϕ  ,  ϕ  ]   =     1  2    D   ⟨  ϕ  ,  ϕ  ⟩         ϕ  ϕ       1  2   D   ϕ  ϕ      [\phi,\phi]=\tfrac{1}{2}D\langle\phi,\phi\rangle          ρ   (  ϕ  )    ⟨  ψ  ,  ψ  ⟩    =   2   ⟨   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   ,  ψ  ⟩          ρ  ϕ   ψ  ψ      2    ϕ  ψ   ψ      \rho(\phi)\langle\psi,\psi\rangle=2\langle[\phi,\psi],\psi\rangle     where φ,ψ,χ are sections of E and f is a smooth function on the base manifold M . D is the combination     κ   -  1     ρ  T   d       superscript  κ    1     superscript  ρ  T   d    \kappa^{-1}\rho^{T}d   with d the de Rham differential,    ρ  T     superscript  ρ  T    \rho^{T}   the dual map of   ρ   ρ   \rho   , and κ the map from E to    E  *     superscript  E     E^{*}   induced by the inner product.  Properties  The bracket is not skew-symmetric as one can see from the third axiom. Instead it fulfills a certain Jacobi-identity (first axiom) and a Leibniz rule (second axiom). From these two axioms one can derive that the anchor map ρ is a morphism of brackets:          ρ   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]    =   [   ρ   (  ϕ  )    ,   ρ   (  ψ  )    ]    .        ρ   ϕ  ψ       ρ  ϕ     ρ  ψ      \rho[\phi,\psi]=[\rho(\phi),\rho(\psi)].        The fourth rule is an invariance of the inner product under the bracket. Polarization leads to          ρ   (  ϕ  )    ⟨  χ  ,  ψ  ⟩    =    ⟨   [  ϕ  ,  χ  ]   ,  ψ  ⟩   +   ⟨  χ  ,   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   ⟩     .        ρ  ϕ   χ  ψ        ϕ  χ   ψ    χ   ϕ  ψ       \rho(\phi)\langle\chi,\psi\rangle=\langle[\phi,\chi],\psi\rangle+\langle\chi,[%
 \phi,\psi]\rangle.        Examples  An example of the Courant algebroid is the Dorfman bracket 3 on the direct sum     T  M   ⊕    T  *   M      direct-sum    T  M      superscript  T    M     TM\oplus T^{*}M   with a twist introduced by Ševera, 4 (1998) defined as:         [   X  +  ξ   ,   Y  +  η   ]   =    [  X  ,  Y  ]   +   (       ℒ  X    η   -   i   (  Y  )   d  ξ    +   i   (  X  )   i   (  Y  )   H    )           X  ξ     Y  η       X  Y          subscript  ℒ  X   η     i  Y  d  ξ      i  X  i  Y  H       [X+\xi,Y+\eta]=[X,Y]+(\mathcal{L}_{X}\,\eta-i(Y)d\xi+i(X)i(Y)H)        where X,Y are vector fields, '' ξ,η'' are 1-forms and H is a closed 3-form twisting the bracket. This bracket is used to describe the integrability of generalized complex structures .  A more general example arises from a Lie algebroid A whose induced differential on    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   will be written as d again. Then use the same formula as for the Dorfman bracket with H an A -3-form closed under d .  Another example of a Courant algebroid is a quadratic Lie algebra, i.e. a Lie algebra with an invariant scalar product. Here the base manifold is just a point and thus the anchor map (and D ) are trivial.  The example described in the paper by Weinstein et al. comes from a Lie bialgebroid, i.e. A a Lie algebroid (with anchor    ρ  A     subscript  ρ  A    \rho_{A}   and bracket     [  .  ,  .  ]   A     subscript   fragments  normal-[  normal-.  normal-,  normal-.  normal-]   A    [.,.]_{A}   ), also its dual    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   a Lie algebroid (inducing the differential    d   A  *      subscript  d   superscript  A      d_{A^{*}}   on     ∧  *   A      superscript     A    \wedge^{*}A   ) and      d   A  *      [  X  ,  Y  ]   A    =     [    d   A  *    X   ,  Y  ]   A   +    [  X  ,    d   A  *    Y   ]   A           subscript  d   superscript  A      subscript   X  Y   A       subscript      subscript  d   superscript  A     X   Y   A    subscript   X     subscript  d   superscript  A     Y    A      d_{A^{*}}[X,Y]_{A}=[d_{A^{*}}X,Y]_{A}+[X,d_{A^{*}}Y]_{A}   (where on the RHS you extend the A -bracket to     ∧  *   A      superscript     A    \wedge^{*}A   using graded Leibniz rule). This notion is symmetric in A and    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   (see Roytenberg). Here    E  =   A  ⊕   A  *        E   direct-sum  A   superscript  A       E=A\oplus A^{*}   with anchor     ρ   (   X  +  α   )    =     ρ  A    (  X  )    +    ρ   A  *     (  α  )           ρ    X  α         subscript  ρ  A   X      subscript  ρ   superscript  A     α      \rho(X+\alpha)=\rho_{A}(X)+\rho_{A^{*}}(\alpha)   and the bracket is the skew-symmetrization of the above in X and α (equivalently in Y and β ):       [   X  +  α   ,   Y  +  β   ]   =    (      [  X  ,  Y  ]   A   +    ℒ  α   A  *    Y    -    i  β    d   A  *    X    )   +   (      [  α  ,  β  ]    A  *    +    ℒ  X  A   β    -    i  Y    d  A   α    )           X  α     Y  β           subscript   X  Y   A      subscript   superscript  ℒ   superscript  A     α   Y       subscript  i  β    subscript  d   superscript  A     X         subscript   α  β    superscript  A        subscript   superscript  ℒ  A   X   β       subscript  i  Y    subscript  d  A   α       [X+\alpha,Y+\beta]=([X,Y]_{A}+\mathcal{L}^{A^{*}}_{\alpha}Y-i_{\beta}d_{A^{*}}%
 X)+([\alpha,\beta]_{A^{*}}+\mathcal{L}^{A}_{X}\beta-i_{Y}d_{A}\alpha)     Skew-symmetric bracket  Instead of the definition above one can introduce a skew-symmetric bracket as       [   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   ]   =    1  2     (   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   -   [  ψ  ,  ϕ  ]   .  )      fragments   fragments  normal-[   fragments  normal-[  ϕ  normal-,  ψ  normal-]   normal-]      1  2    fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-[  ϕ  normal-,  ψ  normal-]     fragments  normal-[  ψ  normal-,  ϕ  normal-]   normal-.  normal-)     [[\phi,\psi]]=\tfrac{1}{2}\big([\phi,\psi]-[\psi,\phi]\big.)     This fulfills a homotopic Jacobi-identity.        [   [  ϕ  ,   [   [  ψ  ,  χ  ]   ]   ]   ]   +  cycl.   =   D  T   (  ϕ  ,  ψ  ,  χ  )           delimited-[]   ϕ   delimited-[]   ψ  χ      cycl.     D  T   ϕ  ψ  χ      [[\phi,[[\psi,\chi]]\,]]+\text{cycl.}=DT(\phi,\psi,\chi)     where T is       T   (  ϕ  ,  ψ  ,  χ  )    =     1  3    ⟨   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   ,  χ  ⟩    +  cycl.         T   ϕ  ψ  χ          1  3     ϕ  ψ   χ    cycl.     T(\phi,\psi,\chi)=\frac{1}{3}\langle[\phi,\psi],\chi\rangle+\text{cycl.}     The Leibniz rule and the invariance of the scalar product become modified by the relation     [   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   ]   =    [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   -    1  2   D   ⟨  ϕ  ,  ψ  ⟩          delimited-[]   ϕ  ψ       ϕ  ψ       1  2   D   ϕ  ψ       [[\phi,\psi]]=[\phi,\psi]-\tfrac{1}{2}D\langle\phi,\psi\rangle   and the violation of skew-symmetry gets replaced by the axiom         ρ  ∘  D   =  0        ρ  D   0    \rho\circ D=0        The skew-symmetric bracket together with the derivation D and the Jacobiator T form a strongly homotopic Lie algebra .  Dirac structures  Given a Courant algebroid with the inner product    ⟨  .  ,  .  ⟩     fragments  normal-⟨  normal-.  normal-,  normal-.  normal-⟩    \langle.,.\rangle   of split signature (e.g. the standard one     T  M   ⊕    T  *   M      direct-sum    T  M      superscript  T    M     TM\oplus T^{*}M   ), then a Dirac structure is a maximally isotropic integrable vector subbundle L → M , i.e.       ⟨  L  ,  L  ⟩   ≡  0       L  L   0    \langle L,L\rangle\equiv 0   ,        rk   L   =     1  2     rk   E         rk  L       1  2   rk  E     \mathrm{rk}\,L=\tfrac{1}{2}\mathrm{rk}\,E   ,       [   Γ  L   ,   Γ  L   ]   ⊂   Γ  L          normal-Γ  L     normal-Γ  L      normal-Γ  L     [\Gamma L,\Gamma L]\subset\Gamma L   .  Examples  As discovered by Courant and parallel by Dorfman, the graph of a 2-form ω ∈ Ω 2 ( M ) is maximally isotropic and moreover integrable iff d ω = 0, i.e. the 2-form is closed under the de Rham differential, i.e. a presymplectic structure.  A second class of examples arises from bivectors    Π  ∈   Γ   (    ∧  2    T  M    )        normal-Π    normal-Γ    superscript   2     T  M       \Pi\in\Gamma(\wedge^{2}TM)   whose graph is maximally isotropic and integrable iff [Π,Π] = 0, i.e. Π is a Poisson bivector on M .  Generalized complex structures  (see also the main article generalized complex geometry )  Given a Courant algebroid with inner product of split signature. A generalized complex structure L → M is a Dirac structure in the complexified Courant algebroid with the additional property       L  ∩   L  ¯    =  0        L   normal-¯  L    0    L\cap\bar{L}=0     where     ¯     normal-¯  absent    \bar{\ }   means complex conjugation with respect to the standard complex structure on the complexification.  As studied in detail by Gualtieri 5 the generalized complex structures permit the study of geometry analogous to complex geometry .  Examples  Examples are beside presymplectic and Poisson structures also the graph of a complex structure  J : TM → TM .
