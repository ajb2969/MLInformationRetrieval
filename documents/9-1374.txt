   Quantum instrument      Quantum instrument   In physics , a quantum instrument is a mathematical abstraction of a quantum measurement , capturing both the classical and quantum outputs. It combines the concepts of measurement and quantum operation .  Definition  Quantum instruments are usually defined as a weighted collection of completely positive maps , the sum of which is trace preserving. That is, it is a collection    ℰ  k     subscript  ℰ  k    \mathcal{E}_{k}   of operators that act as       ρ   A  B    →    ρ  ~    A   A  ′   B    :=    ∑  k       ℰ  k    (   ρ   A  B    )    ⊗   |  k  ⟩      ⟨  k  |    A  ′           normal-→   superscript  ρ    A  B     superscript   normal-~  ρ     A   superscript  A  normal-′   B      assign      subscript   k      tensor-product     subscript  ℰ  k    superscript  ρ    A  B      ket  k     superscript   bra  k    superscript  A  normal-′         \rho^{AB}\rightarrow\tilde{\rho}^{AA^{\prime}B}:=\sum_{k}\mathcal{E}_{k}\left(%
 \rho^{AB}\right)\otimes|k\rangle\langle k|^{A^{\prime}}     A quantum instrument is more general than a quantum operation because it records the outcome k of which operator acted on the state. An expanded development of quantum instruments is given in quantum channel .  References   E. Davies, J. Lewis. An operational approach to quantum probability, Comm. Math.
