Quantum instrument

In physics, a quantum instrument is a mathematical abstraction of a quantum measurement, capturing both the classical and quantum outputs. It combines the concepts of measurement and quantum operation.
Definition
Quantum instruments are usually defined as a weighted collection of completely positive maps, the sum of which is trace preserving. That is, it is a collection 
 
 
 
  of operators that act as



A quantum instrument is more general than a quantum operation because it records the outcome k of which operator acted on the state. An expanded development of quantum instruments is given in quantum channel.
