   Farrell–Markushevich theorem      Farrell–Markushevich theorem   In mathematics , the Farrell–Markushevich theorem , proved independently by O. J. Farrell (1899–1981) and A. I. Markushevich (1908–1979) in 1934, is a result concerning the approximation in mean square of holomorphic functions on a bounded open set in the complex plane by complex polynomials. It states that complex polynomials form a dense subspace of the Bergman space of a domain bounded by a simple closed Jordan curve . The Gram–Schmidt process can be used to construct an orthonormal basis in the Bergman space and hence an explicit form of the Bergman kernel , which in turn yields an explicit Riemann mapping function for the domain.  Proof  Let Ω be the bounded Jordan domain and let Ω n be bounded Jordan domains decreasing to Ω, with Ω n containing the closure of Ω n + 1 . By the Riemann mapping theorem there is a conformal mapping f n of Ω n onto Ω, normalised to fix a given point in Ω with positive derivative there. By the Carathéodory kernel theorem  f n ( z ) converges uniformly on compacta in Ω to z . See:      In fact Carathéodory's theorem implies that the inverse maps tend uniformly on compacta to z . Given a subsequence of f n , it has a subsequence, convergent on compacta in Ω. Since the inverse functions converge to z , it follows that the subsequence converges to z on compacta. Hence f n converges to z on compacta in Ω.  As a consequence the derivative of f n tends to 1 uniformly on compacta.  Let g be a square integrable holomorphic function on Ω, i.e. an element of the Bergman space A 2 (Ω). Define g n on Ω n by g n ( z ) = g ( f n ( z )) f n '( z ). By change of variable         ∥   g  n   ∥    Ω  n   2   =    ∥  g  ∥   Ω  2    .       subscript   superscript   norm   subscript  g  n    2    subscript  normal-Ω  n     superscript   subscript   norm  g   normal-Ω   2     \displaystyle{\|g_{n}\|^{2}_{\Omega_{n}}=\|g\|_{\Omega}^{2}.}     Let h n be the restriction of g n to Ω. Then the norm of h n is less than that of g n . Thus these norms are uniformly bounded. Passing to a subsequence if necessary, it can therefore be assumed that h n has a weak limit in A 2 (Ω). On the other hand h n tends uniformly on compacta to g . Since the evaluation maps are continuous linear functions on A 2 (Ω), g is the weak limit of h n . On the other hand, by Runge's theorem , h n lies in the closed subspace K of A 2 (Ω) generated by complex polynomials. Hence g lies in the weak closure of K , which is K itself. 1  See also   Mergelyan's theorem   Notes  References       "  Category:Theorems in functional analysis  Category:Operator theory  Category:Theorems in complex analysis     ↩
