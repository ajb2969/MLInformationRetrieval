RRNA (adenosine-2'-O-)-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a rRNA (adenosine-2'-O-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + rRNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + rRNA containing a single residue of 2'-O-methyladenosine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and rRNA, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and rRNA containing a single residue of 2'-O-methyladenosine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:rRNA (adenosine-2'-O)-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include ribosomal ribonucleate adenosine 2'-methyltransferase, rRNA adenosine 2'-methylase, RNA-pentose methylase, and thiostrepton-resistance methylase.
