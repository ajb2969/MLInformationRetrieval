Gelfond's constant

In mathematics, Gelfond's constant, named after Aleksandr Gelfond, is e

, that is, e to the power of 

. Like both e and 
 
 
 
 , this constant is a transcendental number. This was first established by Gelfond and may now be considered as an application of the Gelfond–Schneider theorem, noting the fact that



where i is the imaginary unit. Since −i is algebraic but not rational, e

 is transcendental. The constant was mentioned in Hilbert's seventh problem.1 A related constant is 
 
 
 
 , known as the Gelfond–Schneider constant. The related value 
 
 
 
  + e

 is also irrational.2
Numerical value

Geometric peculiarity
The volume of the n-dimensional ball (or n-ball), is given by:



where 
 
 
 
  is its radius and 
 
 
 
  is the gamma function. Any even-dimensional unit ball has volume:



and, summing up all the unit-ball volumes of even-dimension gives:4
