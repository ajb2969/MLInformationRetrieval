   Steane code      Steane code   The Steane code is a tool in quantum error correction introduced by Andrew Steane in 1996. It is a perfect  CSS code (Calderbank-Shor-Steane), using the classical binary self-dual [7,4,3] Hamming code to correct for qubit flip errors (X errors) and the dual of the Hamming code, the [7,3,3] code, to correct for phase flip errors (Z errors). The Steane code is able to correct arbitrary single qubit errors.  In the stabilizer formalism , the Steane code has 6 generators, and the check matrix in standard form is      [     H    0      0    H     ]      H  0    0  H     \begin{bmatrix}H&0\\
 0&H\end{bmatrix}     where H is the parity-check matrix of the Hamming code and is given by       H  =   [     1    0    0    1    0    1    1      0    1    0    1    1    0    1      0    0    1    0    1    1    1     ]    .      H    1  0  0  1  0  1  1    0  1  0  1  1  0  1    0  0  1  0  1  1  1      H=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&1&0&1&1\\
