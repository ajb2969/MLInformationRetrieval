   Nitrite reductase (NAD(P)H)      Nitrite reductase (NAD(P)H)   In enzymology , a nitrite reductase [NAD(P)H] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ammonium hydroxide + 3 NAD(P) + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nitrite + 3 NAD(P)H + 3 H +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are ammonium hydroxide , NAD + , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are nitrite , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ammonium-hydroxide:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include nitrite reductase (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , (phosphate)) , NADH-nitrite oxidoreductase , NADPH-nitrite reductase , assimilatory nitrite reductase , nitrite reductase [NAD(P)H2] , and NAD(P)H2:nitrite oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism . It has 3 cofactors : FAD , Iron , and Siroheme .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
