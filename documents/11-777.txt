Phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase




Phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase

In enzymology, a phosphoribosyl-AMP cyclohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-AMP + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-[(5- phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino]imidazole-4-carboxamide
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-AMP and H2O, whereas its two products are 1-(5-phosphoribosyl)-5-[(5- and [[phosphoribosylamino)methylideneamino]imidazole-4-carboxamide]].
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(5-phospho-D-ribosyl)-AMP 1,6-hydrolase. Other names in common use include PRAMP-cyclohydrolase, and phosphoribosyladenosine monophosphate cyclohydrolase. This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism.
