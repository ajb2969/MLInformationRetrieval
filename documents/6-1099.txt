   Topological algebra      Topological algebra   In mathematics , a topological algebra  A over a topological field  K is a topological vector space together with a continuous multiplication      ⋅  :  A  ×  A  ⟶  A     fragments  normal-⋅  normal-:  A   A  normal-⟶  A    \cdot:A\times A\longrightarrow A          (  a  ,  b  )   ⟼   a  ⋅  b      normal-⟼   a  b    normal-⋅  a  b     (a,b)\longmapsto a\cdot b     that makes it an algebra over K . A unital associative topological algebra is a topological ring . An example of a topological algebra is the algebra C[0,1] of continuous real-valued functions on the closed unit interval [0,1], or more generally any Banach algebra .  The term was coined by David van Dantzig ; it appears in the title of his doctoral dissertation (1931).  The natural notion of subspace in a topological algebra is that of a (topologically) closed subalgebra . A topological algebra A is said to be generated by a subset S if A itself is the smallest closed subalgebra of A that contains S . For example by the Stone–Weierstrass theorem , the set {id [0,1] } consisting only of the identity function id [0,1] is a generating set of the Banach algebra C[0,1].
