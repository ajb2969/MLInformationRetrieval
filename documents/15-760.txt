Hochster–Roberts theorem

In algebra, the Hochster–Roberts theorem, introduced by , states that rings of invariants of reductive groups acting on regular rings are Cohen–Macaulay.
In other words,1

If V is a rational representation of a reductive group G over a field k, then there exist algebraically independent invariant homogeneous polynomials 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a free finite graded module over 
 
 
 
 .
 

proved that if a variety has rational singularities then so does its quotient by the action of a reductive group; this implies the Hochster–Roberts theorem as rational singularities are Cohen–Macaulay.
