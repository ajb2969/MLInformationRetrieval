   Donald C. Spencer      Donald C. Spencer   Donald Clayton Spencer (April 25, 1912 – December 23, 2001) was an American  mathematician , known for work on deformation theory of structures arising in differential geometry , and on several complex variables from the point of view of partial differential equations . He was born in Boulder, Colorado , and educated at the University of Colorado and MIT .  He wrote a Ph.D. in diophantine approximation under J. E. Littlewood and G.H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge , completed in 1939. He had positions at MIT and Stanford before his appointment in 1950 at Princeton University . There he was involved in a series of collaborative works with Kunihiko Kodaira on the deformation of complex structures , which had some influence on the theory of complex manifolds and algebraic geometry , and the conception of moduli spaces .  He also was led to formulate the d-bar Neumann problem , for the operator      ∂  ¯     normal-¯     \bar{\partial}     (see complex differential form ) in PDE theory, to extend Hodge theory and the n -dimensional Cauchy-Riemann equations to the non-compact case. This is used to show existence theorems for holomorphic functions .  He later worked on pseudogroups and their deformation theory, based on a fresh approach to overdetermined systems of PDEs (bypassing the Cartan-Kähler ideas based on differential forms by making an intensive use of jets ). Formulated at the level of various chain complexes , this gives rise to what is now called Spencer cohomology , a subtle and difficult theory both of formal and of analytical structure. This is a kind of Koszul complex theory, taken up by numerous mathematicians during the 1960s. In particular a theory for Lie equations formulated by Malgrange emerged, giving a very broad formulation of the notion of integrability .  After his death, a mountain peak outside of Silverton, Colorado was named in his honor. 1  See also   Kodaira–Spencer mapping   Publications     2   3     References  External links        "  Category:1912 births  Category:2001 deaths  Category:20th-century American mathematicians  Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni  Category:National Medal of Science laureates  Category:People from Boulder, Colorado  Category:Princeton University faculty  Category:University of Colorado alumni     ↩  ↩  ↩
