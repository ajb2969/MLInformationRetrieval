3'-hydroxy-N-methyl-(S)-coclaurine 4'-O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a 3'-hydroxy-N-methyl-(S)-coclaurine 4'-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3'-hydroxy-N-methyl-(S)-coclaurine $\rightleftharpoons$ S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (S)-reticuline
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 3'-hydroxy-N-methyl-(S)-coclaurine, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and (S)-reticuline.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:3'-hydroxy-N-methyl-(S)-coclaurine 4'-O-methyltransferase. This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i.
