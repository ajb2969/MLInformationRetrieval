   Intensity (heat transfer)      Intensity (heat transfer)   In the field of heat transfer , intensity of radiation    I   I   I   is a measure of the distribution of radiant heat flux per unit area and solid angle , in a particular direction, defined according to       d  q   =    I   d   ω    cos    θ   d  A           d  q     I  d  ω      θ  d  A       dq=I\,d\omega\,\cos\theta\,dA     where       d  A      d  A    dA   is the infinitesimal source area      d  q      d  q    dq   is the outgoing heat transfer from the area    d  A      d  A    dA         d  ω      d  ω    d\omega   is the solid angle subtended by the infinitesimal 'target' (or 'aperture') area    d   A  a       d   subscript  A  a     dA_{a}        θ   θ   \theta   is the angle between the source area normal vector and the line-of-sight between the source and the target areas.   Typical units of intensity are W·m −2 ·sr −1 .  Intensity can sometimes be called radiance , especially in other fields of study.  The emissive power of a surface can be determined by integrating the intensity of emitted radiation over a hemisphere surrounding the surface:      q  =    ∫   ϕ  =  0    2  π      ∫   θ  =  0    π  /  2     I   cos  θ    sin   θ  d  θ  d  ϕ           q    superscript   subscript     ϕ  0      2  π      superscript   subscript     θ  0      π  2      I    θ       θ  d  θ  d  ϕ         q=\int_{\phi=0}^{2\pi}\int_{\theta=0}^{\pi/2}I\cos\theta\sin\theta d\theta d\phi     For diffuse emitters, the emitted radiation intensity is the same in all directions, with the result that      E  =   π  I       E    π  I     E=\pi I     The factor   π   π   \pi   (which really should have the units of steradians ) is a result of the fact that intensity is defined to exclude the effect of reduced view factor at large values   θ   θ   \theta   ; note that the solid angle corresponding to a hemisphere is equal to    2  π      2  π    2\pi   steradians.  Spectral intensity     I  λ     subscript  I  λ    I_{\lambda}   is the corresponding spectral measurement of intensity; in other words, the intensity as a function of wavelength .
