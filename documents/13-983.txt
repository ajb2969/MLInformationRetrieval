   Étale algebra      Étale algebra   In commutative algebra , an étale or separable  algebra is a special type of algebra, one that is isomorphic to a finite product of separable extensions.  Definitions  Let   K   K   K   be a field and   ℜ   ℜ   \mathfrak{R}   be a   K   K   K   -algebra. Then   ℜ   ℜ   \mathfrak{R}   is called étale or separable if     ℜ   ⊗  K    K  ¯    ≅    K  ¯   ×  ⋯  ×   K  ¯          subscript  tensor-product  K   ℜ   normal-¯  K       normal-¯  K   normal-⋯   normal-¯  K      \mathfrak{R}\otimes_{K}\bar{K}\cong\bar{K}\times\cdots\times\bar{K}   .  Alternatively an étale algebra is an algebra isomorphic to a finite product of separable extensions.  A third definition says that an étale algebra is a finite dimensional commutative algebra whose trace form ( x , y ) = Tr( xy ) is non-degenerate  The name "étale algebra" comes from the fact that a finite dimensional commutative algebra over a field algebra is étale if and only if      Spec   ℜ   →    Spec   K      normal-→    Spec  ℜ     Spec  K     \mathrm{Spec}\,\mathfrak{R}\to\mathrm{Spec}\,K   is an étale morphism .  Properties  The category of étale algebras over a field k is equivalent to the category of finite G -sets (with continuous G -action), where G is the absolute Galois group of k . In particular étale algebras of dimension n are classified by conjugacy classes of continuous homomorphisms from the absolute Galois group to the symmetric group S n .
