Étale algebra

In commutative algebra, an étale or separable algebra is a special type of algebra, one that is isomorphic to a finite product of separable extensions.
Definitions
Let 
 
 
 
  be a field and 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
 -algebra. Then 
 
 
 
  is called étale or separable if 
 
 
 
  .
Alternatively an étale algebra is an algebra isomorphic to a finite product of separable extensions.
A third definition says that an étale algebra is a finite dimensional commutative algebra whose trace form (x,y) = Tr(xy) is non-degenerate
The name "étale algebra" comes from the fact that a finite dimensional commutative algebra over a field algebra is étale if and only if 
 
 
 
  is an étale morphism.
Properties
The category of étale algebras over a field k is equivalent to the category of finite G-sets (with continuous G-action), where G is the absolute Galois group of k. In particular étale algebras of dimension n are classified by conjugacy classes of continuous homomorphisms from the absolute Galois group to the symmetric group Sn.
