   D-alanine 2-hydroxymethyltransferase      D-alanine 2-hydroxymethyltransferase   In enzymology , a D-alanine 2-hydroxymethyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + D-alanine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tetrahydrofolate + 2-methylserine   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate , D-alanine , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are tetrahydrofolate and 2-methylserine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the hydroxymethyl-, formyl- and related transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:D-alanine 2-hydroxymethyltransferase . This enzyme is also called 2-methylserine hydroxymethyltransferase . This enzyme participates in one carbon pool by folate .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
