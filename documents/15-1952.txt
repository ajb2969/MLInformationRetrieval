Ring of p-adic periods

In mathematics, Fontaine's period rings are a collection of commutative rings first defined by Jean-Marc Fontaine that are used to classify p-adic Galois representations.
The ring BdR
The ring 
 
 
 
  is defined as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the completion of 
 
 
 
 . Let



So an element of 
 
 
 
  is a sequence 
 
 
 
  of elements 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . There is a natural projection map 
 
 
 
  given by 
 
 
 
 . There is also a multiplicative (but not additive) map 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
 , where the 
 
 
 
  are arbitrary lifts of the 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . The composite of 
 
 
 
  with the projection 
 
 
 
  is just 
 
 
 
 . The general theory of Witt vectors yields a unique ring homomorphism 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Teichm√ºller representative of 
 
 
 
 . The ring 
 
 
 
  is defined to be completion of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the ideal 
 
 
 
 . The field 
 
 
 
  is just the field of fractions of
