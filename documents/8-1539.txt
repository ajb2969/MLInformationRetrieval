Minkowski–Steiner formula

In mathematics, the Minkowski–Steiner formula is a formula relating the surface area and volume of compact subsets of Euclidean space. More precisely, it defines the surface area as the "derivative" of enclosed volume in an appropriate sense.
The Minkowski–Steiner formula is used, together with the Brunn–Minkowski theorem, to prove the isoperimetric inequality. It is named after Hermann Minkowski and Jakob Steiner.
Statement of the Minkowski-Steiner formula
Let 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be a compact set. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the Lebesgue measure (volume) of 
 
 
 
 . Define the quantity 
 
 
 
  by the Minkowski–Steiner formula



where



denotes the closed ball of radius

 
 , and



is the Minkowski sum of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , so that



Remarks
Surface measure
For "sufficiently regular" sets 
 
 
 
 , the quantity 
 
 
 
  does indeed correspond with the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional measure of the boundary

 
  of 
 
 
 
 . See Federer (1969) for a full treatment of this problem.
Convex sets
When the set 
 
 
 
  is a convex set, the lim-inf above is a true limit, and one can show that



where the 
 
 
 
  are some continuous functions of 
 
 
 
  (see quermassintegrals) and 
 
 
 
  denotes the measure (volume) of the unit ball in 
 
 
 
 :



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Gamma function.
Example: volume and surface area of a ball
Taking 
 
 
 
  gives the following well-known formula for the surface area of the sphere of radius 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 :














where 
 
 
 
  is as above.
