   3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-androstane-17-one 3alpha-dehydrogenase      3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-androstane-17-one 3alpha-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-androstane-17-one 3alpha-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-androstane-17-one + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5beta-androstane-3,17-dione + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-androstane-17-one and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 5beta-androstane-3,17-dione , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-steroid:NAD + 3-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include etiocholanolone 3alpha-dehydrogenase , etiocholanolone 3alpha-dehydrogenase , and 3alpha-hydroxy-5beta-steroid dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in androgen and estrogen metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
