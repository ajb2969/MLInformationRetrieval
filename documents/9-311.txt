   Discrete measure      Discrete measure   (Figure)  Schematic representation of the Dirac measure by a line surmounted by an arrow. The Dirac measure is a discrete measure whose support is the point 0. The Dirac measure of any set containing 0 is 1, and the measure of any set not containing 0 is 0.   In mathematics , more precisely in measure theory , a measure on the real line is called a discrete measure (in respect to the Lebesgue measure ) if it is at most concentrated on a countable set . Note that the support need not be a discrete set . Geometrically, a discrete measure (on the real line, with respect to Lebesgue measure) is a collection of point masses.  Definition and properties  A measure   μ   μ   \mu   defined on the Lebesgue measurable sets of the real line with values in    [  0  ,  ∞  ]     0     [0,\infty]   is said to be discrete if there exists a (possibly finite) sequence of numbers       s  1   ,   s  2   ,   …       subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-…    s_{1},s_{2},\dots\,     such that       μ   (   ℝ  \   {   s  1   ,   s  2   ,  …  }    )    =  0.        μ   normal-\  ℝ    subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-…     0.    \mu(\mathbb{R}\backslash\{s_{1},s_{2},\dots\})=0.     The simplest example of a discrete measure on the real line is the Dirac delta function     δ  .    δ   \delta.   One has     δ   (   ℝ  \   {  0  }    )    =  0        δ   normal-\  ℝ   0     0    \delta(\mathbb{R}\backslash\{0\})=0   and     δ   (   {  0  }   )    =  1.        δ   0    1.    \delta(\{0\})=1.     More generally, if     s  1   ,   s  2   ,  …      subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-…    s_{1},s_{2},\dots   is a (possibly finite) sequence of real numbers,     a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…    a_{1},a_{2},\dots   is a sequence of numbers in    [  0  ,  ∞  ]     0     [0,\infty]   of the same length, one can consider the Dirac measures     δ   s  i      subscript  δ   subscript  s  i     \delta_{s_{i}}   defined by        δ   s  i     (  X  )    =   {     1      if   s  i    ∈  X       0      if   s  i    ∉  X              subscript  δ   subscript  s  i    X    cases  1      if   subscript  s  i    X   0      if   subscript  s  i    X      \delta_{s_{i}}(X)=\begin{cases}1&\mbox{ if }s_{i}\in X\\
 0&\mbox{ if }s_{i}\not\in X\\
 \end{cases}   for any Lebesgue measurable set    X  .    X   X.   Then, the measure      μ  =    ∑  i     a  i    δ   s  i          μ    subscript   i      subscript  a  i    subscript  δ   subscript  s  i        \mu=\sum_{i}a_{i}\delta_{s_{i}}     is a discrete measure. In fact, one may prove that any discrete measure on the real line has this form for appropriately chosen sequences     s  1   ,   s  2   ,  …      subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-…    s_{1},s_{2},\dots   and     a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…    a_{1},a_{2},\dots     Extensions  One may extend the notion of discrete measures to more general measure spaces . Given a measure space     (  X  ,  Σ  )   ,     X  normal-Σ    (X,\Sigma),   and two measures   μ   μ   \mu   and   ν   ν   \nu   on it,   μ   μ   \mu   is said to be discrete in respect to   ν   ν   \nu   if there exists an at most countable subset   S   S   S   of   X   X   X   such that   All singletons    {  s  }     s    \{s\}   with   s   s   s   in   S   S   S   are measurable (which implies that any subset of   S   S   S   is measurable)       ν   (  S  )    =   0         ν  S   0    \nu(S)=0\,          μ   (   X  \  S   )    =   0.         μ   normal-\  X  S    0.    \mu(X\backslash S)=0.\,      Notice that the first two requirements are always satisfied for an at most countable subset of the real line if   ν   ν   \nu   is the Lebesgue measure, so they were not necessary in the first definition above.  As in the case of measures on the real line, a measure   μ   μ   \mu   on    (  X  ,  Σ  )     X  normal-Σ    (X,\Sigma)   is discrete in respect to another measure   ν   ν   \nu   on the same space if and only if   μ   μ   \mu   has the form      μ  =    ∑  i     a  i    δ   s  i          μ    subscript   i      subscript  a  i    subscript  δ   subscript  s  i        \mu=\sum_{i}a_{i}\delta_{s_{i}}     where     S  =   {   s  1   ,   s  2   ,  …  }    ,      S    subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-…     S=\{s_{1},s_{2},\dots\},   the singletons    {   s  i   }      subscript  s  i     \{s_{i}\}   are in    Σ  ,    normal-Σ   \Sigma,   and their   ν   ν   \nu   measure is 0.  One can also define the concept of discreteness for signed measures . Then, instead of conditions 2 and 3 above one should ask that   ν   ν   \nu   be zero on all measurable subsets of   S   S   S   and   μ   μ   \mu   be zero on measurable subsets of     X  \  S   .     normal-\  X  S    X\backslash S.
