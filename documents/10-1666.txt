L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase




L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase

In enzymology, a L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-ribulose 5-phosphate 
 
 
 
  L-xylulose 5-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-ribulose 5-phosphate, and one product, L-xylulose 5-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-ribulose-5-phosphate 3-epimerase. Other names in common use include L-xylulose 5-phosphate 3-epimerase, UlaE, and SgaU. This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
