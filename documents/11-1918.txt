   Hamaker constant      Hamaker constant   The Hamaker constant A can be defined for a Van der Waals (VdW) body-body interaction:      A  =    π  2   ×  C  ×   ρ  1   ×   ρ  2        A     superscript  π  2   C   subscript  ρ  1    subscript  ρ  2      A=\pi^{2}\times C\times\rho_{1}\times\rho_{2}   where    ρ  1     subscript  ρ  1    \rho_{1}   and    ρ  2     subscript  ρ  2    \rho_{2}   are the number of atoms per unit volume in two interacting bodies and C is the coefficient in the particle-particle pair interaction. 1  The Hamaker constant provides the means to determine the interaction parameter C from the Van der Waals pair potential,     w   (  r  )    =   -   C  /   r  6           w  r       C   superscript  r  6       w(r)=-C/r^{6}   .  Hamaker's method and the associated Hamaker constant ignores the influence of an intervening medium between the two particles of interaction. In the 1950s Lifshitz developed a description of the VdW energy but with consideration of the dielectric properties of this intervening medium (often a continuous phase).  The Van der Waals forces are effective only up to several hundred angstroms. When the interactions are too far apart the dispersion potential decays faster than    1  /   r  6       1   superscript  r  6     1/r^{6}   ; this is called the retarded regime and the result is a Casimir–Polder force .
