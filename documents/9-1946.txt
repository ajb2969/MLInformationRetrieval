Discounted maximum loss

Discounted maximum loss, also known as worst-case risk measure, is the present value of the worst-case scenario for a financial portfolio.
In investment, in order to protect the value of an investment, one must consider all possible alternatives to the initial investment. How one does this comes down to personal preference; however, the worst possible alternative is generally considered to be the benchmark against which all other options are measured. The present value of this worst possible outcome is the discounted maximum loss.
Definition
Given a finite state space 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a portfolio with profit 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the order statistic the discounted maximum loss is simply 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the discount factor.
Given a general probability space

 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a portfolio with discounted return 
 
 
 
  for state 
 
 
 
 . Then the discounted maximum loss can be written as 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the essential infimum.1
Properties

The discounted maximum loss is the expected shortfall at level 
 
 
 
 . It is therefore a coherent risk measure.
The worst-case risk measure 
 
 
 
  is the most conservative (normalized) risk measure in the sense that for any risk measure 
 
 
 
  and any portfolio 
 
 
 
  then

Example
As an example, assume that a portfolio is currently worth 100, and the discount factor is 0.8 (corresponding to an interest rate of 25%):




probability

value





of event

of the portfolio



40%

110



30%

70



20%

150



10%

20



In this case the maximum loss is from 100 to 20 = 80, so the discounted maximum loss is simply
