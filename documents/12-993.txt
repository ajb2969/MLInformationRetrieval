   Valuative criterion      Valuative criterion   In mathematics , specifically algebraic geometry , the valuative criteria are a collection of results that make it possible to decide whether a morphism of algebraic varieties , or more generally schemes , is universally closed , separated , or proper .  Statement of the valuative criteria  Recall that a valuation ring A is a domain, so if K is the field of fractions of A , then Spec K is the generic point of Spec A .  Let X and Y be schemes, and let f : X → Y be a morphism of schemes. Then the following are equivalent:   f is separated (resp. universally closed, resp. proper)  f is quasi-separated (resp. quasi-compact and separated, resp. of finite type) and for every valuation ring A , if ''Y' '' = Spec A and ''X' '' denotes the generic point of ''Y' '', then for every morphism ''Y' '' → Y and every morphism ''X' '' → X which lifts the generic point, then there exists at most one (resp. at least one, resp. exactly one) lift ''Y' '' → X .   The lifting condition is equivalent to specifying that the natural morphism        Hom  Y    (   Y  ′   ,  X  )    →    Hom  Y    (   Spec  K   ,  X  )       normal-→     subscript  Hom  Y     superscript  Y  normal-′   X       subscript  Hom  Y      Spec  K   X      \text{Hom}_{Y}(Y^{\prime},X)\to\text{Hom}_{Y}(\text{Spec}K,X)   is injective (resp. surjective, resp. bijective).
