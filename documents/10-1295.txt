   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating)      Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating)   In enzymology , a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (phosphorylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + phosphate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate , phosphate , and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (phosphorylating) . Other names in common use include triosephosphate dehydrogenase , dehydrogenase, glyceraldehyde phosphate , phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase , 3-phosphoglyceraldehyde dehydrogenase , NAD+-dependent glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase , glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD+) , NADH-glyceraldehyde phosphate dehydrogenase , and glyceraldehyde-3-P-dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in glycolysis / gluconeogenesis .
