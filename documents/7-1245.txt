Auxiliary field

In physics, and especially quantum field theory, an auxiliary field is one whose equations of motion admit a single solution. Therefore, the Lagrangian describing such a field 
 
 
 
  contains an algebraic quadratic term and an arbitrary linear term, while it contains no kinetic terms (derivatives of the field):

 
 .
 The equation of motion for 
 
 
 
  is
 
 
 
  and the Lagrangian becomes: 
 
 
 
 . Auxiliary fields do not propagate and hence the content of any theory remains unchanged by adding such fields by hand. If we have an initial Lagrangian

 
  describing a field 
 
 
 
  then the Lagrangian describing both fields is:

 
 .
 Therefore, auxiliary fields can be employed to cancel quadratic terms in 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and linearize the action


Examples of auxiliary fields are the complex scalar field F in a chiral superfield, the real scalar field D in a vector superfield, the scalar field B in BRST and the field in the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation.
The quantum mechanical effect of adding an auxiliary field is the same as the classical, since the path integral over such a field is Gaussian. To wit:
