   Auxiliary field      Auxiliary field   In physics , and especially quantum field theory , an auxiliary field is one whose equations of motion admit a single solution. Therefore, the Lagrangian describing such a field   A   A   A   contains an algebraic quadratic term and an arbitrary linear term, while it contains no kinetic terms (derivatives of the field):      ℒ   a  u  x    =     1  2    (  A  ,  A  )    +   (   f   (  φ  )    ,  A  )         subscript  ℒ    a  u  x          1  2    A  A       f  φ   A      \mathcal{L}_{aux}=\frac{1}{2}(A,A)+(f(\varphi),A)   . The equation of motion for   A   A   A   is     A   (  φ  )    =   -   f   (  φ  )           A  φ       f  φ      A(\varphi)=-f(\varphi)   and the Lagrangian becomes:     ℒ   a  u  x    =   -    1  2    (   f   (  φ  )    ,   f   (  φ  )    )          subscript  ℒ    a  u  x          1  2      f  φ     f  φ        \mathcal{L}_{aux}=-\frac{1}{2}(f(\varphi),f(\varphi))   . Auxiliary fields do not propagate and hence the content of any theory remains unchanged by adding such fields by hand. If we have an initial Lagrangian     ℒ  0     subscript  ℒ  0    \mathcal{L}_{0}   describing a field   φ   φ   \varphi   then the Lagrangian describing both fields is:     ℒ  =     ℒ  0    (  φ  )    +   ℒ   a  u  x     =     ℒ  0    (  φ  )    -    1  2    (   f   (  φ  )    ,   f   (  φ  )    )           ℒ       subscript  ℒ  0   φ    subscript  ℒ    a  u  x               subscript  ℒ  0   φ       1  2      f  φ     f  φ         \mathcal{L}=\mathcal{L}_{0}(\varphi)+\mathcal{L}_{aux}=\mathcal{L}_{0}(\varphi%
 )-\frac{1}{2}(f(\varphi),f(\varphi))   . Therefore, auxiliary fields can be employed to cancel quadratic terms in   φ   φ   \varphi   in    ℒ  0     subscript  ℒ  0    \mathcal{L}_{0}   and linearize the action      𝒮  =   ∫    ℒ    d  n   x     .      𝒮      ℒ   superscript  d  n   x      \mathcal{S}=\int{\mathcal{L}\,d^{n}x}.     Examples of auxiliary fields are the complex scalar field F in a chiral superfield , the real scalar field D in a vector superfield , the scalar field B in BRST and the field in the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation .  The quantum mechanical effect of adding an auxiliary field is the same as the classical , since the path integral over such a field is Gaussian . To wit:         ∫   -  ∞   ∞     d   A    e    -    1  2    A  2     +   A  f       =     2  π     e   -    f  2   2            superscript   subscript            d  A   superscript  e          1  2    superscript  A  2       A  f             2  π     superscript  e       superscript  f  2   2        \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\!dA\,e^{-\frac{1}{2}A^{2}+Af}=\sqrt{2\pi}e^{-\frac{f^{%
