   Dimethylamine dehydrogenase      Dimethylamine dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a dimethylamine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dimethylamine + H 2 O + electron-transferring flavoprotein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   methylamine + formaldehyde + reduced electron-transferring flavoprotein   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are dimethylamine , H 2 O , and electron-transferring flavoprotein , whereas its 3 products are methylamine , formaldehyde , and reduced electron-transferring flavoprotein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with a flavin as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dimethylamine:electron-transferring flavoprotein oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in methane metabolism . It employs one cofactor , FMN .
