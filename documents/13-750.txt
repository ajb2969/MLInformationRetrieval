Small control property

In nonlinear control theory, a non-linear system of the form 
 
 
 
  is said to satisfy the small control property if for every 
 
 
 
  there exists a 
 
 
 
  so that for all 
 
 
 
  there exists a 
 
 
 
  so that the time derivative of the system's Lyapunov function is negative definite at that point.
In other words, even if the control input is arbitrarily small, a starting configuration close enough to the origin of the system can be found that is asymptotically stabilizable by such an input.
