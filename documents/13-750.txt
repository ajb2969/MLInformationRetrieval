   Small control property      Small control property   In nonlinear control theory, a non-linear system of the form     x  ˙   =   f   (  x  ,  u  )         normal-˙  x     f   x  u      \dot{x}=f(x,u)   is said to satisfy the small control property if for every    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   there exists a    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   so that for all     ∥  x  ∥   <  δ       norm  x   δ    \|x\|<\delta   there exists a     ∥  u  ∥   <  ε       norm  u   ε    \|u\|<\varepsilon   so that the time derivative of the system's Lyapunov function is negative definite at that point.  In other words, even if the control input is arbitrarily small, a starting configuration close enough to the origin of the system can be found that is asymptotically stabilizable by such an input.
