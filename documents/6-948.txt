   Complete numbering      Complete numbering   In computability theory  complete numberings are generalizations of Gödel numbering first introduced by A.I. Mal'tsev in 1963. They are studied because several important results like the Kleene's recursion theorem and Rice's theorem , which were originally proven for the Gödel-numbered set of computable functions , still hold for arbitrary sets with complete numberings.  Definition  A numbering    ν   ν   \nu   of a set   A   A   A   is called complete (with respect to an element    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   ) if for every partial computable function    f   f   f   there exists a total computable function    h   h   h   so that      ν  ∘  h   (  i  )   =   {       ν  ∘  f    (  i  )          if   i   ∈   dom   (  f  )     ,       a     otherwise  .          fragments  ν   h   fragments  normal-(  i  normal-)     fragments  normal-{        ν  f   i       if  i     dom  f      a  otherwise       \nu\circ h(i)=\left\{\begin{matrix}\nu\circ f(i)&\mbox{if}\ i\in\mathrm{dom}(f%
 ),\\
 a&\mbox{otherwise}.\end{matrix}\right.     The numbering   ν   ν   \nu   is called precomplete if          ν  ∘  f    (  i  )    =    ν  ∘  h    (  i  )      i  ∈   dom   (  f  )      .     formulae-sequence        ν  f   i       ν  h   i      i    dom  f      \nu\circ f(i)=\nu\circ h(i)\qquad i\in\mathrm{dom}(f).\,     Examples   any numbering of a singleton set is complete  the identity function on the natural numbers is not complete  a Gödel numbering is precomplete   References   A.I.
