Complete numbering

In computability theory complete numberings are generalizations of Gödel numbering first introduced by A.I. Mal'tsev in 1963. They are studied because several important results like the Kleene's recursion theorem and Rice's theorem, which were originally proven for the Gödel-numbered set of computable functions, still hold for arbitrary sets with complete numberings.
Definition
A numbering

 
  of a set 
 
 
 
  is called complete (with respect to an element 
 
 
 
 ) if for every partial computable function

 
  there exists a total computable function

 
  so that



The numbering 
 
 
 
  is called precomplete if



Examples

any numbering of a singleton set is complete
the identity function on the natural numbers is not complete
a Gödel numbering is precomplete
