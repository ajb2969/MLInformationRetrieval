   Lethargy theorem      Lethargy theorem   In mathematics , a lethargy theorem is a statement about the distance of points in a metric space from members of a sequence of subspaces; one application in numerical analysis is to approximation theory , where such theorems quantify the difficulty of approximating general functions by functions of special form, such as polynomials . In more recent work, the convergence of a sequence of operators is studied: these operators generalise the projections of the earlier work.  Bernstein's lethargy theorem  Let     V  1   ⊂   V  2   ⊂  …         subscript  V  1    subscript  V  2        normal-…     V_{1}\subset V_{2}\subset\ldots   be a strictly ascending sequence of finite-dimensional linear subspaces of a Banach space  X , and let     ϵ  1   ≥   ϵ  2   ≥  …         subscript  ϵ  1    subscript  ϵ  2        normal-…     \epsilon_{1}\geq\epsilon_{2}\geq\ldots   be a decreasing sequence of real numbers tending to zero. Then there exists a point x in X such that the distance of x to V i is exactly    ϵ  i     subscript  ϵ  i    \epsilon_{i}   .
