   Convex body      Convex body   (Figure)  A dodecahedron is a convex body.   In mathematics , a convex body in n - dimensional  Euclidean space      \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   is a compact  convex set with non- empty  interior .  A convex body K is called symmetric if it is centrally symmetric with respect to the origin, i.e. a point x lies in K  if and only if its antipode , âˆ’ x , also lies in K . Symmetric convex bodies are in a one-to-one correspondence with the unit balls of norms on R n .  Important examples of convex bodies are the Euclidean ball , the hypercube and the cross-polytope .
