   BEST theorem      BEST theorem   In graph theory , a part of discrete mathematics , the BEST theorem gives a product formula for the number of Eulerian circuits in directed (oriented) graphs . The name is an acronym of the names of people who discovered it: de B ruijn , van Aardenne- E hrenfest , S mith and T utte .  Precise statement  Let G = ( V , E ) be a directed graph. An Eulerian circuit is a directed closed path which visits each edge exactly once. In 1736, Euler showed that G has an Eulerian circuit if and only if G is connected and the indegree is equal to outdegree at every vertex. In this case G is called Eulerian. We denote these in- and out-degree of a vertex v by deg( v ).  The BEST theorem states that the number ec( G ) of Eulerian circuits in a connected Eulerian graph G is given by the formula        ec   (  G  )    =    t  w    (  G  )     ∏   v  ∈  V      (    deg   (  v  )    -  1   )   !      .       ec  G      subscript  t  w   G    subscript  product    v  V         degree  v   1        \operatorname{ec}(G)=t_{w}(G)\prod_{v\in V}\bigl(\deg(v)-1\bigr)!.     Here t w ( G ) is the number of arborescences , which are trees directed towards the root at a fixed vertex w in G . The number t w (G) can be computed as a determinant , by the version of the matrix tree theorem for directed graphs. It is a property of Eulerian graphs that t v ( G ) = t w ( G ) for every two vertices v and w in a connected Eulerian graph G .  Applications  The BEST theorem shows that the number of Eulerian circuits in directed graphs can be computed in polynomial time , a problem which is #P-complete for undirected graphs. 1 It is also used in the asymptotic enumeration of Eulerian circuits of complete and complete bipartite graphs . 2 3  History  The BEST theorem was first stated in this form in a "note added in proof" to the Aardenne-Ehrenfest and de Bruijn paper (1951). The original proof was bijective and generalized the de Bruijn sequences . It is a variation on an earlier result by Smith and Tutte (1941).  Notes  References    .   .   .   .   .   .
