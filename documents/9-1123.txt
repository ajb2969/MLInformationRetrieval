   Shephard's problem      Shephard's problem   In mathematics , Shephard's problem , is the following geometrical question asked by : if K and L are centrally symmetric convex bodies in n - dimensional  Euclidean space such that whenever K and L are projected onto a hyperplane , the volume of the projection of K is smaller than the volume of the projection of L , then does it follow that the volume of K is smaller than that of L ?  In this case, "centrally symmetric" means that the reflection of K in the origin, −K , is a translate of K , and similarly for L . If π k : R n → Π k is a projection of R n onto some k -dimensional hyperplane Π k (not necessarily a coordinate hyperplane) and V k denotes k -dimensional volume, Shephard's problem is to determine the truth or falsity of the implication         V  k    (    π  k    (  K  )    )    ≤    V  k    (    π  k    (  L  )    )   for all  1   ≤  k  <  n  ⟹    V  n    (  K  )    ≤    V  n    (  L  )     .           subscript  V  k      subscript  π  k   K       subscript  V  k      subscript  π  k   L   for all  1        k       n          subscript  V  n   K           subscript  V  n   L      V_{k}(\pi_{k}(K))\leq V_{k}(\pi_{k}(L))\mbox{ for all }1\leq k     V k ( π k ( K )) is sometimes known as the brightness of K and the function V k  o  π k as a ( k -dimensional) brightness function .  In dimensions n = 1 and 2, the answer to Shephard's problem is "yes". In 1967, however, Petty and Schneider showed that the answer is "no" for every n ≥ 3. The solution of Shephard's problem requires Minkowski's first inequality for convex bodies .
