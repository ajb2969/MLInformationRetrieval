Profunctor

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, profunctors are a generalization of relations and also of bimodules. They are related to the notion of correspondences.
Definition
A profunctor (also named distributor by the French school and module by the Sydney school) 
 
 
 
  from a category

 
  to a category 
 
 
 
 , written


 
 ,
is defined to be a functor



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the opposite category of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes the category of sets. Given morphisms 
 
 
 
 
  respectively in 
 
 
 
  and an element 
 
 
 
 , we write 
 
 
 
  to denote the actions.
Using the cartesian closure of 
 
 
 
 , the category of small categories, the profunctor 
 
 
 
 
  can be seen as a functor



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the category 
 
 
 
  of presheaves over 
 
 
 
 .
A correspondence from 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is a profunctor 
 
 
 
 .
Composition of profunctors
The composite 
 
 
 
  of two profunctors


 
  and 
 
 

is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is the left Kan extension of the functor 
 
 
 
  along the Yoneda functor

 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  (which to every object 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  associates the functor 
 
 
 
 ).
It can be shown that



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the least equivalence relation such that 
 
 
 
  whenever there exists a morphism 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 .
The bicategory of profunctors
Composition of profunctors is associative only up to isomorphism (because the product is not strictly associative in Set). The best one can hope is therefore to build a bicategory Prof whose

0-cells are small categories,
1-cells between two small categories are the profunctors between those categories,
2-cells between two profunctors are the natural transformations between those profunctors.

Properties
Lifting functors to profunctors
A functor 
 
 
 
  can be seen as a profunctor 
 
 
 
  by postcomposing with the Yoneda functor:


 
 .
It can be shown that such a profunctor 
 
 
 
  has a right adjoint. Moreover, this is a characterization: a profunctor 
 
 
 
 
  has a right adjoint if and only if 
 
 
 
  factors through the Cauchy completion of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. there exists a functor 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
