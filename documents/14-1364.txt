Riemann invariant

Riemann invariants are mathematical transformations made on a system of conservation equations to make them more easily solvable. Riemann invariants are constant along the characteristic curves of the partial differential equations where they obtain the name invariant. They were first obtained by Bernhard Riemann in his work on plane waves in gas dynamics.1
Mathematical theory
Consider the set of conservation equations:



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the elements of the matrices

 
  and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are elements of vectors. It will be asked if it is possible to rewrite this equation to



To do this curves will be introduced in the 
 
 
 
  plane defined by the vector field

 
 . The term in the brackets will be rewritten in terms of a total derivative where 
 
 
 
  are parametrized as 
 
 




comparing the last two equations we find



which can be now written in characteristic form



where we must have the conditions






where 
 
 
 
  can be eliminated to give the necessary condition



so for a nontrival solution is the determinant



For Riemann invariants we are concerned with the case when the matrix 
 
 
 
  is an identity matrix to form



notice this is homogeneous due to the vector 
 
 
 
  being zero. In characteristic form the system is


 
  with 
 
 

Where 
 
 
 
  is the left eigenvector of the matrix 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the characteristic speeds of the eigenvalues of the matrix 
 
 
 
  which satisfy



To simplify these characteristic equations we can make the transformations such that 
 
 

which form



An integrating factor

 
  can be multiplied in to help integrate this. So the system now has the characteristic form


 
  on 
 
 

which is equivalent to the diagonal system2




The solution of this system can be given by the generalized hodograph method.34
Example
Consider the shallow water equations






write this system in matrix form



where the matrix 
 
 
 
  from the analysis above the eigenvalues and eigenvectors need to be found.The eigenvalues are found to satisfy



to give



and the eigenvectors are found to be



where the Riemann invariants are






In shallow water equations there is the relation 
 
 
 
  to give the Riemann invariants






to give the equations






Which can be solved by the hodograph transformation. If the matrix form of the system of pde's is in the form



Then it may be possible to multiply across by the inverse matrix 
 
 
 
  so long as the matrix determinant of 
 
 
 
  is not zero.
