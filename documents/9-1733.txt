   Caristi fixed-point theorem      Caristi fixed-point theorem   In mathematics , the Caristi fixed-point theorem (also known as the Caristi–Kirk fixed-point theorem ) generalizes the Banach fixed point theorem for maps of a complete  metric space into itself. Caristi's fixed-point theorem is a variation of the ε - variational principle of  Ekeland (1974, 1979). Moreover, the conclusion of Caristi's theorem is equivalent to metric completeness, as proved by Weston (1977). The original result is due to the mathematicians James Caristi and William Arthur Kirk .  Statement of the theorem  Let ( X , d ) be a complete metric space. Let T : X → X and f : X → [0, +∞) be a lower semicontinuous function from X into the non-negative real numbers . Suppose that, for all points x in X ,        d   (  x  ,   T   (  x  )    )    ≤    f   (  x  )    -   f   (   T   (  x  )    )      .        d   x    T  x         f  x     f    T  x       d\big(x,T(x)\big)\leq f(x)-f\big(T(x)\big).     Then T has a fixed point in X , i.e. a point x 0 such that T ( x 0 ) = x 0 .  References        "  Category:Fixed-point theorems  Category:Theorems in real analysis  Category:Metric geometry
