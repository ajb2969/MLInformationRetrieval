True longitude




True longitude

In celestial mechanics true longitude is the ecliptic longitude at which an orbiting body could actually be found if its inclination were zero. Together with the inclination and the ascending node, the true longitude can tell us the precise direction from the central object at which the body would be located at a particular time.
Calculation
The true longitude 
 
 
 
  can be calculated as follows:1 2 3


where:



 
  is orbit's true anomaly,


 
  is the longitude of orbit's periapsis,


 
  is the argument of periapsis, and


 
  is the longitude of the orbit's ascending node,
