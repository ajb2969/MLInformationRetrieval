   Fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory      Fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory   In algebra, the fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory describes the effects of changing the ring of K-groups from a ring R to    R   [  t  ]       R   delimited-[]  t     R[t]   or    R   [  t  ,   t   -  1    ]       R   t   superscript  t    1       R[t,t^{-1}]   . The theorem was first proved by Bass for     K  0   ,   K  1       subscript  K  0    subscript  K  1     K_{0},K_{1}   and was later extended to higher K-groups by Quillen.  Let     G  i    (  R  )        subscript  G  i   R    G_{i}(R)   be the algebraic K-theory of the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian ring R ; explicitly, we can take      G  i    (  R  )    =    π  i    (    B  +    f-gen-Mod  R    )           subscript  G  i   R      subscript  π  i      superscript  B     subscript  f-gen-Mod  R       G_{i}(R)=\pi_{i}(B^{+}\text{f-gen-Mod}_{R})   , where     B  +   =   Ω  B  Q        superscript  B      normal-Ω  B  Q     B^{+}=\Omega BQ   is given by Quillen's Q-construction . If R is a regular ring (i.e., has finite global dimension ), then       G  i    (  R  )    =    K  i    (  R  )     ,         subscript  G  i   R      subscript  K  i   R     G_{i}(R)=K_{i}(R),   the i -th K-group of R . 1 This is an immediate consequence of the resolution theorem , which compares the K-theories of two different categories (with inclusion relation.)  For a noetherian ring  R , the fundamental theorem states: 2   (i)       G  i    (   R   [  t  ]    )    =    G  i    (  R  )     ,   i  ≥  0      formulae-sequence       subscript  G  i     R   delimited-[]  t        subscript  G  i   R      i  0     G_{i}(R[t])=G_{i}(R),\,i\geq 0   .  (ii)       G  i    (   R   [  t  ,   t   -  1    ]    )    =     G  i    (  R  )    ⊕    G   i  -  1     (  R  )      ,    i  ≥  0   ,     G   -  1     (  R  )    =  0       formulae-sequence       subscript  G  i     R   t   superscript  t    1        direct-sum     subscript  G  i   R      subscript  G    i  1    R      formulae-sequence    i  0        subscript  G    1    R   0      G_{i}(R[t,t^{-1}])=G_{i}(R)\oplus G_{i-1}(R),\,i\geq 0,\,G_{-1}(R)=0   .   The proof of the theorem uses the Q-construction . There is also a version of the theorem for the singular case (for    K  i     subscript  K  i    K_{i}   ); this is the version proved in Grayson's paper.
