Fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory

In algebra, the fundamental theorem of algebraic K-theory describes the effects of changing the ring of K-groups from a ring R to 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . The theorem was first proved by Bass for 
 
 
 
  and was later extended to higher K-groups by Quillen.
Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the algebraic K-theory of the category of finitely generated modules over a noetherian ring R; explicitly, we can take 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is given by Quillen's Q-construction. If R is a regular ring (i.e., has finite global dimension), then 
 
 
 
  the i-th K-group of R.1 This is an immediate consequence of the resolution theorem, which compares the K-theories of two different categories (with inclusion relation.)
For a noetherian ring R, the fundamental theorem states:2

(i) 
 
 
 
 .
(ii) 
 
 
 
 
 .

The proof of the theorem uses the Q-construction. There is also a version of the theorem for the singular case (for 
 
 
 
 ); this is the version proved in Grayson's paper.
