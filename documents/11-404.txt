2-Carboxy-D-arabinitol-1-phosphatase

In enzymology, a 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol-1-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  2-carboxy-D-arabinitol + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, to be specific, those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol-1-phosphate 1-phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include 2-carboxyarabinitol 1-phosphatase, and 2-carboxy-D-arabinitol 1-phosphate phosphohydrolase.
