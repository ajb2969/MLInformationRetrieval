   Boundary-incompressible surface      Boundary-incompressible surface   In low-dimensional topology , a boundary-incompressible surface is a two-dimensional surface within a three-dimensional manifold whose topology cannot be made simpler by a certain type of operation known as boundary compression .  Suppose M is a 3-manifold  with boundary . Suppose also that S is a compact surface with boundary that is properly embedded in M , meaning that the boundary of S is a subset of the boundary of M and the interior points of S are a subset of the interior points of M . A boundary-compressing disk for S in M is defined to be a disk D in M such that     D  ∩  S   =  α        D  S   α    D\cap S=\alpha   and     D  ∩   ∂  M    =  β        D    M    β    D\cap\partial M=\beta   are arcs in    ∂  D      D    \partial D   , with     α  ∪  β   =   ∂  D         α  β     D     \alpha\cup\beta=\partial D   ,     α  ∩  β   =   ∂  α   =   ∂  β           α  β     α          β      \alpha\cap\beta=\partial\alpha=\partial\beta   , and   α   α   \alpha   is an essential arc in S (   α   α   \alpha   does not cobound a disk in S with another arc in    ∂  S      S    \partial S   ).  The surface S is said to be boundary-compressible if either S is a disk that cobounds a ball with a disk in    ∂  M      M    \partial M   or there exists a boundary-compressing disk for S in M . Otherwise, S is boundary-incompressible .  Alternatively, one can relax this definition by dropping the requirement that the surface be properly embedded. Suppose now that S is a compact surface (with boundary) embedded in the boundary of a 3-manifold M . Suppose further that D is a properly embedded disk in M such that D intersects S in an essential arc (one that does not cobound a disk in S with another arc in    ∂  S      S    \partial S   ). Then D is called a boundary-compressing disk for S in M . As above, S is said to be boundary-compressible if either S is a disk in    ∂  M      M    \partial M   or there exists a boundary-compressing disk for S in M . Otherwise, S is boundary-incompressible.  For instance, if K is a trefoil knot embedded in the boundary of a solid torus V and S is the closure of a small annular neighborhood of K in    ∂  V      V    \partial V   , then S is not properly embedded in V since the interior of S is not contained in the interior of V . However, S is embedded in    ∂  V      V    \partial V   and there does not exist a boundary-compressing disk for S in V , so S is boundary-incompressible by the second definition.
