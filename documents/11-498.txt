Glycosulfatase




Glycosulfatase

In enzymology, a glycosulfatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glucose 6-sulfate + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucose 6-sulfate and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucose and sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on sulfuric ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sugar-sulfate sulfohydrolase. This enzyme is also called glucosulfatase. This enzyme participates in glycolysis / gluconeogenesis.
