Simplicial localization

In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the simplicial localization of a category C with respect to a class W of morphisms of C is a simplicial category LC whose 
 
 
 
  is the localization

 
  of C with respect to W; that is, 
 
 
 
  for any objects x, y in C. The notion is due to Dwyer and Kan.
