   Simplicial localization      Simplicial localization   In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the simplicial localization of a category  C with respect to a class W of morphisms of C is a simplicial category  LC whose    π  0     subscript  π  0    \pi_{0}   is the localization     C   [   W   -  1    ]       C   delimited-[]   superscript  W    1       C[W^{-1}]   of C with respect to W ; that is,      π  0   L  C   (  x  ,  y  )    =   C   [   W   -  1    ]    (  x  ,  y  )           subscript  π  0   L  C   x  y      C   delimited-[]   superscript  W    1      x  y      \pi_{0}LC(x,y)=C[W^{-1}](x,y)   for any objects x , y in C . The notion is due to Dwyer and Kan .  References   W. G.
