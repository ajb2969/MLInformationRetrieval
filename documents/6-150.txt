Abel polynomials

The Abel polynomials in mathematics form a polynomial sequence, the nth term of which is of the form



The sequence is named after Niels Henrik Abel (1802-1829), the Norwegian mathematician.
This polynomial sequence is of binomial type: conversely, every polynomial sequence of binomial type may be obtained from the Abel sequence in the umbral calculus.
