   Gosset–Elte figures      Gosset–Elte figures   In geometry , the Gosset–Elte figures , named by Coxeter after Thorold Gosset and E. L. Elte , are a group of uniform polytopes which are not regular , generated by a Wythoff construction with mirrors all related by order-2 and order-3 dihedral angles. They can be seen as one-end-ringed  Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams .  The Coxeter symbol for these figures has the form k i,j , where each letter represents a length of order-3 branches on a Coxeter–Dynkin diagram with a single ring on the end node of a k length sequence of branches. The vertex figure of k i,j is ( k − 1) i,j , and each of its facets are represented by subtracting one from one of the nonzero subscripts, i.e. k i − 1, j and k i , j − 1 . 1  Rectified simplices are included in the list as limiting cases with k =0. Similarly 0 i,j,k represents a bifurcated graph with a central node ringed.  History  Coxeter named these figures as k i,j (or k ij ) in shorthand and gave credit of their discovery to Gosset and Elte: 2   Thorold Gosset first published a list of ''regular and semi-regular figures in space of n dimensions'' 3 in 1900, enumerating polytopes with one or more types of regular polytope faces. This included the rectified 5-cell  0 21 in 4-space, demipenteract  1 21 in 5-space, 2 21 in 6-space, 3 21 in 7-space, 4 21 in 8-space, and 5 21 infinite tessellation in 8-space.  E. L. Elte independently enumerated a different semiregular list in his 1912 book, The Semiregular Polytopes of the Hyperspaces . 4 He called them semiregular polytopes of the first kind , limiting his search to one or two types of regular or semiregular k-faces.   Elte's enumeration included all the k ij polytopes except for the 1 42 which has 3 types of 6-faces.  The set of figures extend into honeycombs of (2,2,2), (3,3,1), and (5,4,1) families in 6,7,8 dimensional Euclidean spaces respectively. Gosset's list included the 5 21 honeycomb as the only semiregular one in his definition.  Definition  The polytopes and honeycombs in this family can be seen within ADE classification .  A finite polytope k ij exists if        1   i  +  1    +   1   j  +  1    +   1   k  +  1     >  1          1    i  1      1    j  1      1    k  1     1    \frac{1}{i+1}+\frac{1}{j+1}+\frac{1}{k+1}>1   or equal for Euclidean honeycombs, and less for hyperbolic honeycombs.  The Coxeter group  [3 i,j,k ] can generate up to 3 unique uniform Gosset–Elte figures with Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams with one end node ringed. By Coxeter 's notation, each figure is represented by k ij to mean the end-node on the k -length sequence is ringed.  The simplex family can be seen as a limiting case with k =0, and all rectified (single-ring) Coxeter–Dynkin diagrams.  A-family [3 n ] (rectified simplices )  The family of n - simplices contain Gosset–Elte figures of the form 0 ij as all rectified forms of the n -simplex ( i + j = n − 1).  They are listed below, along with their Coxeter–Dynkin diagram , with each dimensional family drawn as a graphic orthogonal projection in the plane of the Petrie polygon of the regular simplex.

Rectified n - demihypercubes , a lower symmetry form of a birectified n -cube, can also be represented as 0 k11 .

The 4-dimensional affine Coxeter group ,     Q  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  Q   4    {\tilde{Q}}_{4}   , [3 1,1,1,1 ], has four order-3 branches, and can express one honeycomb, 1 111 , , represents a lower symmetry form of the 16-cell honeycomb , and 0 1111 ,  for the rectified 16-cell honeycomb . The 5-dimensional hyperbolic Coxeter group ,     L  ¯   4     subscript   normal-¯  L   4    {\bar{L}}_{4}   , [3 1,1,1,1,1 ], has five order-3 branches, and can express one honeycomb, 1 1111 ,  and its rectification as 0 11111 , .
