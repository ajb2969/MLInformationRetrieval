   Conjugacy class sum      Conjugacy class sum   In abstract algebra , a conjugacy class sum , or simply class sum , is a function defined for each conjugacy class of a finite group  G as the sum of the elements in that conjugacy class. The class sums of a group form a basis for the center of the associated group algebra .  Definition  Let G be a finite group, and let C 1 ,...,C k be the distinct conjugacy classes of G . For 1≤ i ≤ k , define         C  i   ¯   =    ∑   g  ∈   C  i     g    .       normal-¯   subscript  C  i      subscript     g   subscript  C  i     g     \overline{C_{i}}=\sum_{g\in C_{i}}g.     The functions      C  1   ¯   ,  …  ,    C  k   ¯       normal-¯   subscript  C  1    normal-…   normal-¯   subscript  C  k      \overline{C_{1}},\ldots,\overline{C_{k}}   are the class sums of G .  In the Group Algebra  Let C G be the complex group algebra over G . Then the center of C G , denoted Z ( C G ), is defined by       Z   (   𝐂  G   )    =   {   f  ∈   𝐂  G    ∣     ∀  g   ∈   𝐂  G    ,    f  g   =   g  f     }         Z    𝐂  G     conditional-set    f    𝐂  G     formulae-sequence     for-all  g     𝐂  G        f  g     g  f        Z(\mathbf{C}G)=\{f\in\mathbf{C}G\mid\forall g\in\mathbf{C}G,fg=gf\}   .  This is equal to the set of all class functions (functions which are constant on conjugacy classes). To see this, note that f is central if and only if f ( yx )= f ( xy ) for all x,y ∈ G . Replacing y by yx −1 , this condition becomes        f   (   x  y   x   -  1     )    =   f   (  y  )   for  x    ,   y  ∈  G      formulae-sequence      f    x  y   superscript  x    1        f  y  for  x      y  G     f(xyx^{-1})=f(y)\text{ for }x,y\in G   .  The class sums are a basis for the set of all class functions, and thus they are a basis for the center of the algebra.  In particular, this shows that the dimension of Z ( C G ) is equal to the number of class sums of G .  References   Goodman, Roe; and Wallach, Nolan (2009).
