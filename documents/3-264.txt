   Uniform norm      Uniform norm   (Figure)  The perimeter of the square is the set of points in R 2 where the sup norm equals a fixed positive constant.   In mathematical analysis , the uniform norm (or sup norm ) assigns to real- or complex -valued bounded functions f defined on a set S the non-negative number         ∥  f  ∥   ∞   =    ∥  f  ∥    ∞  ,  S    =   sup   {   |   f   (  x  )    |   :   x  ∈   S    }     .         subscript   norm  f      subscript   norm  f     S          supremum   conditional-set      f  x      x  S        \|f\|_{\infty}=\|f\|_{\infty,S}=\sup\left\{\,\left|f(x)\right|:x\in S\,\right\}.     This norm is also called the supremum norm, the Chebyshev norm, or the infinity norm. The name "uniform norm" derives from the fact that a sequence of functions    {   f  n   }      subscript  f  n     \{f_{n}\}   converges to f under the metric derived from the uniform norm if and only if    f  n     subscript  f  n    f_{n}   converges to   f   f   f    uniformly . 1  If we allow unbounded functions, this formula does not yield a norm or metric in a strict sense, although the obtained so-called extended metric still allows one to define a topology on the function space in question.  If f is a continuous function on a closed interval , or more generally a compact set, then it is bounded and the supremum in the above definition is attained by the Weierstrass extreme value theorem , so we can replace the supremum by the maximum. In this case, the norm is also called the maximum norm . In particular, for the case of a vector    x  =   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       x    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      x=(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})   in finite  dimensional  coordinate space , it takes the form         ∥  x  ∥   ∞   =   max   {   |   x  1   |   ,  …  ,   |   x  n   |   }     .       subscript   norm  x          subscript  x  1    normal-…     subscript  x  n       \|x\|_{\infty}=\max\{|x_{1}|,\dots,|x_{n}|\}.     The reason for the subscript "∞" is that whenever f is continuous         lim   p  →  ∞      ∥  f  ∥   p    =    ∥  f  ∥   ∞    ,        subscript    normal-→  p      subscript   norm  f   p     subscript   norm  f       \lim_{p\rightarrow\infty}\|f\|_{p}=\|f\|_{\infty},     where        ∥  f  ∥   p   =    (    ∫  D       |  f  |   p    d  μ    )    1  /  p         subscript   norm  f   p    superscript    subscript   D      superscript    f   p   d  μ      1  p      \|f\|_{p}=\left(\int_{D}\left|f\right|^{p}\,d\mu\right)^{1/p}     where D is the domain of f (and the integral amounts to a sum if D is a discrete set ).  The binary function       d   (  f  ,  g  )    =    ∥   f  -  g   ∥   ∞         d   f  g     subscript   norm    f  g        d(f,g)=\|f-g\|_{\infty}     is then a metric on the space of all bounded functions (and, obviously, any of its subsets) on a particular domain. A sequence { f n : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } converges uniformly to a function f if and only if        lim   n  →  ∞      ∥    f  n   -  f   ∥   ∞    =   0.         subscript    normal-→  n      subscript   norm     subscript  f  n   f       0.    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\|f_{n}-f\|_{\infty}=0.\,     We can define closed sets and closures of sets with respect to this metric topology; closed sets in the uniform norm are sometimes called uniformly closed and closures uniform closures . The uniform closure of a set of functions A is the space of all functions that can be approximated by a sequence of uniformly-converging functions on A. For instance, one restatement of the Stone–Weierstrass theorem is that the set of all continuous functions on    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   is the uniform closure of the set of polynomials on    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   .  For complex  continuous functions over a compact space , this turns it into a C* algebra .
