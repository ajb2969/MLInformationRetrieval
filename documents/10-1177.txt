   Beurling–Lax theorem      Beurling–Lax theorem   In mathematics , the ' Beurling–Lax theorem ' is a theorem due to  and  which characterizes the shift - invariant subspaces of the Hardy space      H  2    (  𝔻  ,  ℂ  )        superscript  H  2    𝔻  ℂ     H^{2}(\mathbb{D},\mathbb{C})   . It states that each such space is of the form       θ   H  2    (  𝔻  ,  ℂ  )    ,      θ   superscript  H  2    𝔻  ℂ     \theta H^{2}(\mathbb{D},\mathbb{C}),     for some inner function    θ   θ   \theta   .
