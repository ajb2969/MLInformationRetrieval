Absorbing set

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics an absorbing set in a vector space is a set S which can be inflated to include any element of the vector space. Alternative terms are radial or absorbent set.
Definition
Given a vector space X over the field F of real or complex numbers, a set S is called absorbing if for all 
 
 
 
  there exists a real number r such that

Examples

In a semi normed vector space the unit ball is absorbing.
