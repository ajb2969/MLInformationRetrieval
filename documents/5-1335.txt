   Absorbing set      Absorbing set   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics an absorbing set in a vector space is a set  S which can be inflated to include any element of the vector space. Alternative terms are radial or absorbent set .  Definition  Given a vector space X over the field  F of real or complex numbers, a set S is called absorbing if for all    x  ‚àà  X      x  X    x\in X   there exists a real number r such that        ‚àÄ  Œ±   ‚àà  ùîΩ   :    |  Œ±  |   ‚â•  r  ‚áí  x  ‚àà   Œ±  S       normal-:     for-all  Œ±   ùîΩ         Œ±   r    normal-‚áí    x         Œ±  S       \forall\alpha\in\mathbb{F}:|\alpha|\geq r\Rightarrow x\in\alpha S   with       Œ±  S   :=   {   Œ±  s   ‚à£   s  ‚àà  S   }      assign    Œ±  S    conditional-set    Œ±  s     s  S      \alpha S:=\{\alpha s\mid s\in S\}     Examples   In a semi normed vector space the unit ball is absorbing.
