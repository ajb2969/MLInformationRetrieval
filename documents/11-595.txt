   3alpha(S)-strictosidine beta-glucosidase      3alpha(S)-strictosidine beta-glucosidase   In enzymology , a 3alpha(S)-strictosidine beta-glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   strictosidine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + strictosidine aglycone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are strictosidine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-glucose and strictosidine aglycone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is strictosidine beta-D-glucohydrolase . This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis .
