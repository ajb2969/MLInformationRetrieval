 Nikola Tesla (10 July 1856 - 7 January 1943) was a world-renown inventor, physicist, mechanical engineer and electrical engineer. He is best known for his revolutionary work in the discipline of electricity and magnetism. Tesla's patents and theoretical work contributed to modern alternating current electric power (AC) systems, including the polyphase power distribution systems and the AC motor and even the inventor of the radio. His contribution was recognised and the derived SI unit measuring magnetic flux density or magnetic induction (commonly known as the magnetic field

 
 ), the tesla, was named in his honour."
