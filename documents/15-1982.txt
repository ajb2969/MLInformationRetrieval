   2-iminoacetate synthase      2-iminoacetate synthase   2-iminoacetate synthase (, thiH (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name L-tyrosine 4-methylphenol-lyase (2-iminoacetate-forming) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   L- tyrosine + S-adenosyl-L-methionine + reduced acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-iminoacetate + 4- methylphenol + 5'-deoxyadenosine + L- methionine + acceptor + 2 H +    This enzyme binds a 4Fe-4S cluster.
