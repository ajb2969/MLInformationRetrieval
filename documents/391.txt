   Thymidine-triphosphatase      Thymidine-triphosphatase   In enzymology , a thymidine-triphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dTTP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dTDP + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dTTP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dTDP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dTTP nucleotidohydrolase . Other names in common use include thymidine triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase , dTTPase , and deoxythymidine-5'-triphosphatase . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.6.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
