   Chiral homology      Chiral homology   In mathematics , chiral homology , introduced by Beilinson−Drinfeld, is, in their words, "a “quantum” version of (the algebra of functions on) the space of global horizontal sections of an affine    𝒟  X     subscript  𝒟  X    \mathcal{D}_{X}   -scheme (i.e., the space of global solutions of a system of non-linear differential equations)."  Lurie's topological chiral homology gives a generalization. 1  See also   Ran space  Chiral Lie algebra   References   Ch. 4 of Beilinson−Drinfeld, Chiral algebras, available at 1   "  Category:Homological algebra     ↩
