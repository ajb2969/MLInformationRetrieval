   10-deacetylbaccatin III 10-O-acetyltransferase      10-deacetylbaccatin III 10-O-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a 10-deacetylbaccatin III 10-O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + 10-deacetylbaccatin III   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + baccatin III   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and 10-deacetylbaccatin III , whereas its two products are CoA and baccatin III .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:taxan-10beta-ol O-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis .
