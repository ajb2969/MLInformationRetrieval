   Chladni's law      Chladni's law   Chladni's law , named after Ernst Chladni , relates the frequency of modes of vibration for flat circular surfaces with fixed center as a function of the numbers m of diametric (linear) nodes and n of radial (circular) nodes. It is stated as the equation      f  =   C    (   m  +   2  n    )   p        f    C   superscript    m    2  n    p      f=C(m+2n)^{p}   where C and p are coefficients which depend on the properties of the plate. 1  For flat circular plates, p is roughly 2, but Chladni's law can also be used to describe the vibrations of cymbals , handbells , and church bells in which case p can vary from 1.4 to 2.4. 2 In fact, p can even vary for a single object, depending on which family of modes is being examined.
