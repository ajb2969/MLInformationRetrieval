O-phospho-L-serine—tRNA ligase

O-phospho-L-serine---tRNA ligase (, O-phosphoseryl-tRNA ligase, non-canonical O-phosphoseryl-tRNA synthetase, SepRS) is an enzyme with system name O-phospho-L-serine:tRNACys ligase (AMP-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + O-phospho-L-serine + tRNACys 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + O-phospho-L-seryl-tRNACys
 

In organisms like Archaeoglobus fulgidus, this enzyme ligates O-phosphoserine to tRNACys.
