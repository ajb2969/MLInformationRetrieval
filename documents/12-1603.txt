Papyrus 103 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 
 
 
103, is a copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Gospel of Matthew.
Description
The surviving texts of Matthew are verses 13:55-56; 14:3-5, they are in a fragmentary condition. The manuscript palaeographically has been assigned to the late 2nd or early 3rd century.
Probably together with Papyrus 77 it belonged to the same codex.1

Text

The Greek text of the codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. According to Comfort it is proto-Alexandrian text.
In Matthew 13:55, the name of Jesus' second brother reads [...]ης so that both Ἰωάννης (John) and Ἰωσῆς (Joses) are possible original readings.
