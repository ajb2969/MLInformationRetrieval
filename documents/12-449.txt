Computable real function

In mathematical logic, specifically computability theory, a function

 
  is sequentially computable if, for every computable sequence

 
  of real numbers, the sequence

 
  is also computable.
A function 
 
 
 
  is effectively uniformly continuous if there exists a recursive function

 
  such that, if



then



A real function is computable if it is both sequentially computable and effectively uniformly continuous,1
These definitions can be generalized to functions of more than one variable or functions only defined on a subset of 
 
 
 
  The generalizations of the latter two need not be restated. A suitable generalization of the first definition is:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a subset of 
 
 
 
  A function 
 
 
 
  is sequentially computable if, for every 
 
 
 
 -tuplet 
 
 
 
  of computable sequences of real numbers such that



the sequence 
 
 
 
  is also computable.
