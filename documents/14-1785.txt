Peeling theorem

In general relativity, the peeling theorem describes the asymptotic behavior of the Weyl tensor as one goes to null infinity. Let 
 
 
 
  be a null geodesic in a spacetime

 
  from a point p to null infinity, with affine parameter

 
 . Then the theorem states that, as 
 
 
 
  tends to infinity:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Weyl tensor, and we used the abstract index notation. Moreover, in the Petrov classification, 
 
 
 
  is type IV, 
 
 
 
  is type III, 
 
 
 
  is type II (or II-II) and 
 
 
 
  is type I.
