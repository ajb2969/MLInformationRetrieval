2-Amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase

2-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase (, ADIC synthase, 2-amino-2-deoxyisochorismate synthase, SgcD) is an enzyme with system name (2S)-2-amino-4-deoxychorismate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2S)-2-amino-4-deoxychorismate + L-glutamate

chorismate + L-glutamine
 

This enzyme requires Mg2+. The reaction occurs in the reverse direction.
