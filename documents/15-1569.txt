   2-Amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase      2-Amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase   2-amino-4-deoxychorismate synthase (, ADIC synthase , 2-amino-2-deoxyisochorismate synthase , SgcD ) is an enzyme with system name (2S)-2-amino-4-deoxychorismate:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (2S)-2-amino-4-deoxychorismate + L- glutamate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    chorismate + L-glutamine   This enzyme requires Mg 2+ . The reaction occurs in the reverse direction.  References  External links     "  Category:EC 2.6.1     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
