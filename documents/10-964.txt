   Tryptophan alpha,beta-oxidase      Tryptophan alpha,beta-oxidase   In enzymology , a tryptophan alpha,beta-oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-tryptophan + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alpha,beta-didehydrotryptophan + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-tryptophan and O 2 , whereas its two products are alpha,beta-didehydrotryptophan and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tryptophan:oxygen alpha,beta-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include L-tryptophan 2',3'-oxidase , and L-tryptophan alpha,beta-dehydrogenase . It employs one cofactor , heme .  References      "  Category:EC 1.3.3  Category:Heme enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
