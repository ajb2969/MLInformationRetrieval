   Crocco's theorem      Crocco's theorem   Crocco's theorem is a fluid dynamics theorem relating the flow velocity , vorticity , and stagnation pressure (or entropy ) of a potential flow . Crocco's theorem gives the relation between the thermodynamics and fluid kinematics. The theorem was first enunciated by Alexander Friedmann for the particular case of a perfect gas and published in 1922: 1        D  𝐮    D  t    =    T   ∇  s    -   ∇  h            D  𝐮     D  t        T   normal-∇  s     normal-∇  h      \frac{D\mathbf{u}}{Dt}=T\nabla\,s-\nabla\,h     However, usually this theorem is connected with the name of Italian scientist Luigi Crocco , 2 a son of Gaetano Crocco .  Consider an element of fluid in the flow field subjected to translational and rotational motion: because stagnation pressure loss and entropy generation can be viewed as essentially the same thing, there are three popular forms for writing Crocco's theorem:   Stagnation pressure     𝐮  ×  𝝎   =   v   ∇   p  0           𝐮  𝝎     v   normal-∇   subscript  p  0       \mathbf{u}\times\boldsymbol{\omega}=v\nabla p_{0}    3  Entropy (the following form holds for plane steady flows)     T    d  s    d  n     =     d   h  0     d  n    +   u  ω          T      d  s     d  n           d   subscript  h  0      d  n      u  ω      T\frac{ds}{dn}=\frac{dh_{0}}{dn}+u\omega    4  Momentum        ∂  𝐮    ∂  t    +   ∇   (     u  2   2   +  h   )     =    u  ×  𝝎   +   T   ∇  s    +  𝐠    ,            𝐮     t     normal-∇       superscript  u  2   2   h         u  𝝎     T   normal-∇  s    𝐠     \frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\nabla\left(\frac{u^{2}}{2}+h\right)=u%
 \times\boldsymbol{\omega}+T\nabla s+\mathbf{g},      In the above equations,   𝐮   𝐮   \mathbf{u}   is the flow velocity vector,   ω   ω   \omega   is the vorticity,   v   v   v   is the specific volume,    p  0     subscript  p  0    p_{0}   is the stagnation pressure ,   T   T   T   is temperature ,   s   s   s   is specific entropy ,   h   h   h   is specific enthalpy ,   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is specific body force , and   n   n   n   is the direction normal to the streamlines. All quantities considered (entropy, enthalpy, and body force) are specific , in the sense of "per unit mass".  References        "  Category:Fluid dynamics     Friedmann A.
