Phloretin hydrolase




Phloretin hydrolase

In enzymology, a phloretin hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phloretin + H2O 
 
 
 
  phloretate + phloroglucinol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phloretin and H2O, whereas its two products are phloretate and phloroglucinol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carbon–carbon bonds in ketonic substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxydehydrochalcone 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzenehydrolase. This enzyme is also called lactase-phlorizin hydrolase.
