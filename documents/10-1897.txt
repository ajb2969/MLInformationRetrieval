   Phloretin hydrolase      Phloretin hydrolase   In enzymology , a phloretin hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phloretin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phloretate + phloroglucinol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phloretin and H 2 O , whereas its two products are phloretate and phloroglucinol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon–carbon bonds in ketonic substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2',4,4',6'-tetrahydroxydehydrochalcone 1,3,5-trihydroxybenzenehydrolase . This enzyme is also called lactase-phlorizin hydrolase .
