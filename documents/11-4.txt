Propioin synthase




Propioin synthase

In enzymology, a propioin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-hydroxy-3-hexanone 
 
 
 
  2 propanal
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4-hydroxy-3-hexanone, and one product, propanal.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxy-3-hexanone propanal-lyase (propanal-forming). Other names in common use include 4-hydroxy-3-hexanone aldolase, and 4-hydroxy-3-hexanone propanal-lyase.
