Stretch rule

In physics, the stretch rule (sometimes referred to as Routh's rule) states that the moment of inertia of a rigid object is unchanged when the object is stretched parallel to an axis of rotation that is a principal axis, provided that the distribution of mass remains unchanged except in the direction parallel to the axis.1 This operation leaves cylinders oriented parallel to the axis unchanged in radius.
This rule can be applied with the parallel axis theorem and the perpendicular axes rule to find moments of inertia for a variety of shapes.
Derivation
The (scalar) moment of inertia of a rigid body around the z-axis is given by:



Where 
 
 
 
  is the distance of a point from the z-axis. We can expand as follows, since we are dealing with stretching over the z-axis only:



Here, 
 
 
 
 
  is the body's height. Stretching the object by a factor of 
 
 
 
  along the z-axis is equivalent to dividing the mass density by 
 
 
 
  (meaning 
 
 
 
 ), as well as integrating over new limits 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  (the new height of the object), thus leaving the total mass unchanged. This means the new moment of inertia will be:
