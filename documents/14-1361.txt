   Mehler–Fock transform      Mehler–Fock transform   In mathematics, the Mehler–Fock transform is an integral transform introduced by  and rediscovered by .  It is given by        F   (  x  )    =    ∫  0  ∞     P    i  t   -   1  /  2      (  x  )   f   (  t  )   d  t     ,        F  x     superscript   subscript   0        subscript  P      i  t     1  2     x  f  t  d  t      F(x)=\int_{0}^{\infty}P_{it-1/2}(x)f(t)dt,     where P is a Legendre function of the first kind.
