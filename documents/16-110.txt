Alpha-terpinene synthase

Alpha-terpinene synthase () is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, alpha-terpinene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate $\rightleftharpoons$ alpha-terpinene + diphosphate


The enzyme has been characterized from Dysphania ambrosioides (American wormseed).
