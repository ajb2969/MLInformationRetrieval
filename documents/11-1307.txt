Lipopolysaccharide 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase

In enzymology, a lipopolysaccharide 3-alpha-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-galactose + lipopolysaccharide 
 
 
 
  UDP + 3-alpha-D-galactosyl-[lipopolysaccharide glucose]
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and lipopolysaccharide, whereas its two products are UDP and 3-alpha-D-galactosyl-[lipopolysaccharide glucose].
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:lipopolysaccharide 3-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP-galactose:lipopolysaccharide alpha,3-galactosyltransferase, UDP-galactose:polysaccharide galactosyltransferase, uridine diphosphate galactose:lipopolysaccharide, alpha-3-galactosyltransferase, uridine diphosphogalactose-lipopolysaccharide, and alpha,3-galactosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2.
Structural studies
