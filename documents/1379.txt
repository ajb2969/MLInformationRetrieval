   Four-frequency      Four-frequency   The four-frequency of a photon is defined by       N  a   =   (  ν  ,   ν  𝐧   )        superscript  N  a    ν    ν  𝐧      N^{a}=\left(\nu,\nu\mathbf{n}\right)     where   ν   ν   \nu   is the photon's frequency and   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}   is a unit vector in the direction of the photon's motion. The four-frequency is always a future-pointing and null vector . An observer moving with four-velocity    V   V   V   will observe a frequency        1  c    η   (   N  a   ,  V  )         1  c   η    superscript  N  a   V     \tfrac{1}{c}\eta(N^{a},V)     Where   η   η   \eta   is the Minkowski inner-product (+---)  Closely related to the four-frequency is the wave four-vector defined by       K  a   =   (   ω  c   ,  𝐤  )        superscript  K  a      ω  c   𝐤     K^{a}=\left(\frac{\omega}{c},\mathbf{k}\right)     where    ω  =   2  π  ν       ω    2  π  ν     \omega=2\pi\nu   ,   c   c   c   is the speed of light and    𝐤  =     2  π   λ   𝐧       𝐤        2  π   λ   𝐧     \mathbf{k}=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\mathbf{n}   and   λ   λ   \lambda   is the wavelength of the photon. The wave four-vector is more often used in practice than the four-frequency, but the two vectors are related (using    c  =   ν  λ       c    ν  λ     c=\nu\lambda   ) by       K  a   =     2  π   c    N  a         superscript  K  a         2  π   c    superscript  N  a      K^{a}=\frac{2\pi}{c}N^{a}     References       "  Category:Minkowski spacetime
