   Nucleoside oxidase      Nucleoside oxidase   Nucleoside oxidase () is an enzyme with system name nucleoside:oxygen 5'-oxidoreductase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   inosine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   9-riburonosylhypoxanthine + H 2 O  (1a) 2 inosine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 5'-dehydroinosine + 2 H 2 O  (1b) 2 5'-dehydroinosine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 9-riburonosylhypoxanthine   This enzyme could use other purine and pyrimidine  nucleosides (as well as 2'- deoxynucleosides ) are substrates.
