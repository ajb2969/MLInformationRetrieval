Nucleoside oxidase

Nucleoside oxidase () is an enzyme with system name nucleoside:oxygen 5'-oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

inosine + O2

 
  9-riburonosylhypoxanthine + H2O
 
(1a) 2 inosine + O2

 
  2 5'-dehydroinosine + 2 H2O
 
(1b) 2 5'-dehydroinosine + O2

 
  2 9-riburonosylhypoxanthine
 

This enzyme could use other purine and pyrimidine nucleosides (as well as 2'-deoxynucleosides) are substrates.
