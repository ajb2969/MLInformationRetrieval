Effective medium approximations or effective medium theory (sometimes abbreviated as EMA or EMT) pertains to analytical or theoretical modeling that describes the macroscopic properties of composite materials. EMAs or EMTs are developed from averaging the multiple values of the constituents that directly make up the composite material. At the constituent level, the values of the materials vary and are inhomogeneous. Precise calculation of the many constituent values is nearly impossible. However, theories have been developed that can produce acceptable approximations which in turn describe useful parameters and properties of the composite material as a whole. In this sense, effective medium approximations are descriptions of a medium (composite material) based on the properties and the relative fractions of its components and are derived from calculations.12
Applications
They can be discrete models such as applied to resistor networks or continuum theories as applied to elasticity or viscosity but most of the current theories have difficulty in describing percolating systems. Indeed, among the numerous effective medium approximations, only Bruggeman’s symmetrical theory is able to predict a threshold. This characteristic feature of the latter theory puts it in the same category as other mean field theories of critical phenomena.
There are many different effective medium approximations,3 each of them being more or less accurate in distinct conditions. Nevertheless, they all assume that the macroscopic system is homogeneous and typical of all mean field theories, they fail to predict the properties of a multiphase medium close to the percolation threshold due to the absence of long-range correlations or critical fluctuations in the theory.
The properties under consideration are usually the conductivity

 
  or the dielectric constant

 
  of the medium. These parameters are interchangeable in the formulas in a whole range of models due to the wide applicability of the Laplace equation. The problems that fall outside of this class are mainly in the field of elasticity and hydrodynamics, due to the higher order tensorial character of the effective medium constants.
Bruggeman's Model
Formulas
Without any loss of generality, we shall consider the study of the effective conductivity (which can be either dc or ac) for a system made up of spherical multicomponent inclusions with different arbitrary conductivities. Then the Bruggeman formula takes the form:
Circular and spherical inclusions



In a system of Euclidean spatial dimension 
 
 
 
 
  that has an arbitrary number of components,4 the sum is made over all the constituents. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are respectively the fraction and the conductivity of each component, and 
 
 
 
  is the effective conductivity of the medium. (The sum over the 
 
 
 
 's is unity.)
Elliptical and ellipsoidal inclusions



This is a generalization of Eq. (1) to a biphasic system with ellipsoidal inclusions of conductivity 
 
 
 
  into a matrix of conductivity 
 
 
 
 .5 The fraction of inclusions is 
 
 
 
  and the system is 
 
 
 
  dimensional. For randomly oriented inclusions,



where the 
 
 
 
 's denote the appropriate doublet/triplet of depolarization factors which is governed by the ratios between the axis of the ellipse/ellipsoid. For example: in the case of a circle {
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 } and in the case of a sphere {
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 }. (The sum over the 
 
 
 
  's is unity.)
The most general case to which the Bruggeman approach has been applied involves bianisotropic ellipsoidal inclusions.6
Derivation
The figure illustrates a two-component medium.7 Let us consider the cross-hatched volume of conductivity 
 
 
 
 , take it as a sphere of volume 
 
 
 
  and assume it is embedded in a uniform medium with an effective conductivity 
 
 
 
 
 . If the electric field far from the inclusion is 
 
 
 
  then elementary considerations lead to a dipole moment associated with the volume



This polarization produces a deviation from 
 
 
 
 . If the average deviation is to vanish, the total polarization summed over the two types of inclusion must vanish. Thus



where 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are respectively the volume fraction of material 1 and 2. This can be easily extended to a system of dimension 
 
 
 
  that has an arbitrary number of components. All cases can be combined to yield Eq. (1).
Eq. (1) can also be obtained by requiring the deviation in current to vanish 8 9 . It has been derived here from the assumption that the inclusions are spherical and it can be modified for shapes with other depolarization factors; leading to Eq. (2).
A more general derivation applicable to bianisotropic materials is also available.10
Modeling of percolating systems
The main approximation is that all the domains are located in an equivalent mean field. Unfortunately, it is not the case close to the percolation threshold where the system is governed by the largest cluster of conductors, which is a fractal, and long-range correlations that are totally absent from Bruggeman's simple formula. The threshold values are in general not correctly predicted. It is 33% in the EMA, in three dimensions, far from the 16% expected from percolation theory and observed in experiments. However, in two dimensions, the EMA gives a threshold of 50% and has been proven to model percolation relatively well 11 12 13 .
Maxwell Garnett Equation
In the Maxwell Garnett Approximation the effective medium consists of a matrix medium with 
 
 
 
  and inclusions with 
 
 
 
 .
Formula
The Maxwell Garnett equation reads:14


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the effective dielectric constant of the medium, 
 
 
 
  is the one of the inclusions and 
 
 
 
  is the one of the matrix; 
 
 
 
  is the volume fraction of the inclusions.
The Maxwell Garnett equation is solved by:


15 16 so long as the denominator does not vanish. A simple MATLAB calculator using this formula is as follows.
% This simple MATLAB calculator computes the effective dielectric
 % constant of a mixture of an inclusion material in a base medium
 % according to the Maxwell Garnett theory as introduced in:
 % http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_Medium_Approximations
 % INPUTS:
 %   eps_base: dielectric constant of base material;
 %   eps_incl: dielectric constant of inclusion material;
 %   vol_incl: volume portion of inclusion material;
 % OUTPUT:
 %   eps_mean: effective dielectric constant of the mixture.
 
 function [eps_mean] = MaxwellGarnettFormula(eps_base, eps_incl, vol_incl)
 
 small_number_cutoff = 1e-6;
 
 if vol_incl < 0 || vol_incl > 1
     disp(['WARNING: volume portion of inclusion material is out of range!']);
 end
 factor_up = 2*(1-vol_incl)*eps_base+(1+2*vol_incl)*eps_incl;
 factor_down = (2+vol_incl)*eps_base+(1-vol_incl)*eps_incl;
 if abs(factor_down) < small_number_cutoff
     disp(['WARNING: the effective medium is singular!']);
     eps_mean = 0;
 else
     eps_mean = eps_base*factor_up/factor_down;
 end
Derivation
For the derivation of the Maxwell Garnett equation we start with an array of polarizable particles. By using the Lorentz local field concept, we obtain the Clausius-Mossotti relation:


 
  Where 
 
 
 
  is the number of particles per unit volume. By using elementary electrostatics, we get for a spherical inclusion with dielectric constant 
 
 
 
  and a radius 
 
 
 
  a polarisability 
 
 
 
 
 :


 
  If we combine 
 
 
 
  with the Clausius Mosotti equation, we get:


 
  Where 
 
 
 
  is the effective dielectric constant of the medium, 
 
 
 
 
  is the one of the inclusions; 
 
 
 
  is the volume fraction of the inclusions.
 As the model of Maxwell Garnett is a composition of a matrix medium with inclusions we enhance the equation:



Validity
In general terms, the Maxwell Garnett EMA is expected to be valid at low volume fractions 
 
 
 
  since it is assumed that the domains are spatially separated .17
