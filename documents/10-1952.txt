   Branched-chain-2-oxoacid decarboxylase      Branched-chain-2-oxoacid decarboxylase   In enzymology , a branched-chain-2-oxoacid decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-methylbutanal + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate , and two products , 2-methylbutanal and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate carboxy-lyase (2-methylbutanal-forming) . Other names in common use include branched-chain oxo acid decarboxylase , branched-chain alpha-keto acid decarboxylase , branched-chain keto acid decarboxylase , BCKA , and (3S)-3-methyl-2-oxopentanoate carboxy-lyase .
