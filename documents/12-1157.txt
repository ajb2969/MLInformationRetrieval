   Bispinor      Bispinor   In physics , a bispinor is an object with four complex components which transform in a specific way under Lorentz transformations : specifically, a bispinor is an element of a 4-dimensional complex  vector space considered as a (½,0)⊕(0,½) representation of the Lorentz group . 1 Bispinors are, for example, used to describe relativistic spin-½ wave functions.  In the Weyl basis , a bispinor      ψ  =   (      ψ  L        ψ  R      )       ψ     subscript  ψ  L      subscript  ψ  R       \psi=\left(\begin{array}[]{c}\psi_{L}\\
 \psi_{R}\end{array}\right)   consists of two (two-component) Weyl spinors    ψ  L     subscript  ψ  L    \psi_{L}   and    ψ  R     subscript  ψ  R    \psi_{R}   which transform, correspondingly, under (½,0) and (0,½) representations of the    S  O   (  1  ,  3  )       S  O   1  3     SO(1,3)   group (the Lorentz group without parity transformations ). Under parity transformation the Weyl spinors transform into each other.  The Dirac bispinor is connected with the Weyl bispinor by a unitary transformation to the Dirac basis ,       ψ  →    1   2     [     1    1       -  1     1     ]   ψ   =    1   2     (       ψ  R   +   ψ  L          ψ  R   -   ψ  L       )     .       normal-→  ψ      1    2     delimited-[]    1  1      1   1     ψ            1    2         subscript  ψ  R    subscript  ψ  L         subscript  ψ  R    subscript  ψ  L          \psi\rightarrow{1\over\sqrt{2}}\left[\begin{array}[]{cc}1&1\\
 -1&1\end{array}\right]\psi={1\over\sqrt{2}}\left(\begin{array}[]{c}\psi_{R}+%
 \psi_{L}\\
 \psi_{R}-\psi_{L}\end{array}\right).   The Dirac basis is the one most widely used in the literature.  Expressions for Lorentz transformations of bispinors  A bispinor field    ψ   (  x  )       ψ  x    \psi(x)   transforms according to a rule        ψ  a    (  x  )    →    ψ   ′   a    (  x  )    =   S    [  Λ  ]   b  a    ψ  b    (    Λ   -  1    x   )         normal-→     superscript  ψ  a   x      superscript   superscript  ψ  normal-′   a   x          S   subscript   superscript   delimited-[]  normal-Λ   a   b    superscript  ψ  b      superscript  normal-Λ    1    x       \psi^{a}(x)\to{\psi^{\prime}}^{a}(x)=S[\Lambda]^{a}_{b}\psi^{b}(\Lambda^{-1}x)   where   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   is a Lorentz transformation . Here the coordinates of physical points are multiplied on the left by   Λ   normal-Λ   \Lambda   , so the point with coordinate     Λ   -  1    x       superscript  normal-Λ    1    x    \Lambda^{-1}x   before the transformation has coordinate   x   x   x   after the transformation.  In the Weyl basis, explicit transformation matrices for a boost    Λ   b  o  o  s  t      subscript  normal-Λ    b  o  o  s  t     \Lambda_{boost}   and for a rotation    Λ   r  o  t      subscript  normal-Λ    r  o  t     \Lambda_{rot}   are the following: 2       S   [   Λ   b  o  o  s  t    ]    =   (      e   +    χ  ⋅  σ   /  2       0      0     e   ;   -    χ  ⋅  σ   /  2         )         S   delimited-[]   subscript  normal-Λ    b  o  o  s  t         superscript  e       normal-⋅  χ  σ   2     0    0   fragments  e   superscript  normal-;       normal-⋅  χ  σ   2          S[\Lambda_{boost}]=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}e^{+\chi\cdot\sigma/2}&0\\
 0&e^{-\chi\cdot\sigma/2}\end{array}\right)          S   [   Λ   r  o  t    ]    =   (      e   +     i  ϕ   ⋅  σ   /  2       0      0     e   ;   +     i  ϕ   ⋅  σ   /  2         )         S   delimited-[]   subscript  normal-Λ    r  o  t         superscript  e       normal-⋅    i  ϕ   σ   2     0    0   fragments  e   superscript  normal-;       normal-⋅    i  ϕ   σ   2          S[\Lambda_{rot}]=\left(\begin{array}[]{cc}e^{+i\phi\cdot\sigma/2}&0\\
 0&e^{+i\phi\cdot\sigma/2}\end{array}\right)     Here   χ   χ   \chi   is the boost parameter, and    ϕ  i     superscript  ϕ  i    \phi^{i}   represents rotation around the    x  i     superscript  x  i    x^{i}   axis.    σ  i     subscript  σ  i    \sigma_{i}   are the Pauli matrices . The exponential is the exponential map , in this case the matrix exponential defined by putting the matrix into the usual power series for the exponential function.  Properties  A bilinear form of bispinors can be reduced to five irreducible (under the Lorentz group) objects:   scalar ,     ψ  ¯   ψ       normal-¯  ψ   ψ    \bar{\psi}\psi   ;  pseudo-scalar ,     ψ  ¯    γ  5   ψ       normal-¯  ψ    subscript  γ  5   ψ    \bar{\psi}\gamma_{5}\psi   ;  vector ,     ψ  ¯    γ  μ   ψ       normal-¯  ψ    superscript  γ  μ   ψ    \bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi   ;  pseudo-vector ,     ψ  ¯    γ  μ    γ  5   ψ       normal-¯  ψ    superscript  γ  μ    subscript  γ  5   ψ    \bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\gamma_{5}\psi   ;  antisymmetric tensor,     ψ  ¯    (     γ  μ    γ  ν    -    γ  ν    γ  μ     )   ψ       normal-¯  ψ        superscript  γ  μ    superscript  γ  ν       superscript  γ  ν    superscript  γ  μ     ψ    \bar{\psi}(\gamma^{\mu}\gamma^{\nu}-\gamma^{\nu}\gamma^{\mu})\psi   ,   where     ψ  ¯   ≡    ψ  †    γ  0         normal-¯  ψ      superscript  ψ  normal-†    subscript  γ  0      \bar{\psi}\equiv\psi^{\dagger}\gamma_{0}   and    {   γ  μ   ,   γ  5   }      superscript  γ  μ    subscript  γ  5     \{\gamma^{\mu},\gamma_{5}\}   are the gamma matrices .  A suitable Lagrangian for the relativistic spin-½ field can be built out of these, and is given as       ℒ  =     i  2    (     ψ  ¯    γ  μ     ∂  μ   ψ    -    ∂  μ     ψ  ¯    γ  μ   ψ     )    -   m   ψ  ¯    ψ      .      ℒ        i  2        normal-¯  ψ    superscript  γ  μ     subscript   μ   ψ      subscript   μ      normal-¯  ψ    superscript  γ  μ   ψ        m   normal-¯  ψ   ψ      \mathcal{L}={i\over 2}\left(\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\partial_{\mu}\psi-\partial_%
 {\mu}\bar{\psi}\gamma^{\mu}\psi\right)-m\bar{\psi}\psi\;.   The Dirac equation can be derived from this Lagrangian by using the Euler–Lagrange equation .  Derivation of a bispinor representation  Introduction  This outline describes one type of bispinors as elements of a particular representation space of the (½,0)⊕ (0,½) representation of the Lorentz group. This representation space is related to, but not identical to, the (½,0)⊕ (0,½) representation space contained in the Clifford algebra over Minkowski spacetime as described in the article Spinors . Language and terminology is used as in Representation theory of the Lorentz group . The only property of Clifford algebras that is essential for the presentation is the defining property given in  below. The basis elements of    𝐬𝐨   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐬𝐨   3  1     \mathbf{so}(3;1)    are labeled .  A representation of the Lie algebra    𝐬𝐨   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐬𝐨   3  1     \mathbf{so}(3;1)   of the Lorentz group    𝐎   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐎   3  1     \mathbf{O}(3;1)   will emerge among matrices that will be chosen as a basis (as a vector space) of the complex Clifford algebra over spacetime. These    4  ×  4      4  normal-×  4    4×4   matrices are then exponentiated yielding a representation of . This representation, that turns out to be a     (   1  2   ,  0  )   ⊕   (  0  ,   1  2   )          1  2   0   normal-⊕   0    1  2      (\frac{1}{2},0)⊕(0,\frac{1}{2})   representation, will act on an arbitrary 4-dimensional complex vector space, which will simply be taken as , and its elements will be bispinors.  For reference, the commutation relations of    𝐬𝐨   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐬𝐨   3  1     \mathbf{so}(3;1)   are  with the spacetime metric    η  =   d  i  a  g   (   −  1   ,  1  ,  1  ,  1  )        η    d  i  a  g     normal-−  1   1  1  1      η=diag(−1,1,1,1)   .  The Gamma Matrices  Let γ μ denote a set of four 4-dimensional Gamma matrices , here called the Dirac matrices . The Dirac matrices satisfy  where } is the anticommutator , is a    4  ×  4      4  normal-×  4    4×4   unit matrix, and is the spacetime metric with signature (-,+,+,+). This is the defining condition for a generating set of a Clifford algebra . Further basis elements of the Clifford algebra are given by  Only six of the matrices are linearly independent. This follows directly from their definition since −σ νμ }} . They act on the subspace the span in the passive sense , according to  In , the second equality follows from property  of the Clifford algebra.  Lie algebra embedding of so(3;1) in C ℓ 4 (C)  Now define an action of    𝐬𝐨   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐬𝐨   3  1     \mathbf{so}(3;1)   on the , and the linear subspace  they span in , given by  The last equality in (C4) , which follows from (C2) and the property (D1) of the gamma matrices, shows that the constitute a representation of    𝐬𝐨   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐬𝐨   3  1     \mathbf{so}(3;1)   since the commutation relations in  are exactly those of    𝐬𝐨   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐬𝐨   3  1     \mathbf{so}(3;1)   . The action of can be either be thought of as 6-dimensional matrices multiplying the basis vectors , since the space in spanned by the is 6-dimensional, or it can be thought of as the action by commutation on the . In the following, }}  The and the are both (disjoint) subsets of the basis elements of C ℓ 4 ( C ), generated by the 4-dimensional Dirac matrices in 4 spacetime dimensions. The Lie algebra of    𝐬𝐨   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐬𝐨   3  1     \mathbf{so}(3;1)   is thus embedded in C ℓ 4 ( C ) by   π   π   π   as the real subspace of C ℓ 4 ( C ) spanned by the . For a full description of the remaining basis elements other than and of the Clifford algebra, please see the article Dirac algebra .  Bispinors introduced  Now introduce any 4-dimensional complex vector space U where the γ μ act by matrix multiplication. Here  C 4 }} will do nicely. Let e ω μν M μν }} be a Lorentz transformation and define the action of the Lorentz group on U to be        u  →   S   (  Λ  )   u   =    e   i  π   (    ω   μ  ν     M   μ  ν     )     u    ;    u  α   →     [   e    ω   μ  ν     σ   μ  ν      ]   α    u   β   β       .     formulae-sequence     normal-→  u    S  normal-Λ  u           superscript  e    i  π     subscript  ω    μ  ν     superscript  M    μ  ν       u      normal-→   superscript  u  α      superscript   delimited-[]   superscript  e     subscript  ω    μ  ν     superscript  σ    μ  ν       α    subscript   superscript  u  β   β       u\rightarrow S(\Lambda)u=e^{i\pi(\omega_{\mu\nu}M^{\mu\nu})}u;\quad u^{\alpha}%
 \rightarrow[e^{\omega_{\mu\nu}\sigma^{{\mu\nu}}}]^{\alpha}{}_{\beta}u^{\beta}.     Since the according to  constitute a representation of    𝐬𝐨   (  3  ;  1  )       𝐬𝐨   3  1     \mathbf{so}(3;1)   , the induced map  according to general theory either is a representation or a projective representation of . It will turn out to be a projective representation. The elements of U , when endowed with the transformation rule given by S , are called bispinors or simply spinors .  A choice of Dirac matrices  It remains to choose a set of Dirac matrices in order to obtain the spin representation   S   S   S   . One such choice, appropriate for the ultrarelativistic limit , is  where the are the Pauli matrices . In this representation of the Clifford algebra generators, the become  This representation is manifestly not irreducible, since the matrices are all block diagonal . But by irreducibility of the Pauli matrices, the representation cannot be further reduced. Since it is a 4-dimensional, the only possibility is that it is a     (   1  2   ,  0  )   ⊕   (  0  ,   1  2   )          1  2   0   normal-⊕   0    1  2      (\frac{1}{2},0)⊕(0,\frac{1}{2})   representation, i.e. a bispinor representation. Now using the recipe of exponentiation of the Lie algebra representation to obtain a representation of ,  a projective 2-valued representation is obtained. Here   φ   φ   φ   is a vector of rotation parameters with , and   χ   χ   χ   is a vector of boost parameters . With the conventions used here one may write  for a bispinor field. Here, the upper component corresponds to a right  Weyl spinor . To include space parity inversion in this formalism, one sets  as representative for    P  =   d  i  a  g   (  1  ,   −  1   ,   −  1   ,   −  1   )        P    d  i  a  g   1    normal-−  1     normal-−  1     normal-−  1       P=diag(1,−1,−1,−1)   . It seen that the representation is irreducible when space parity inversion included.  An example  Let 2πM 12 }} so that   X   X   X   generates a rotation around the z-axis by an angle of    2  π      2  π    2π   . Then e iX {{=}} I ∈ SO(3;1) + }} but -I ∈ GL( U )}} . Here,   I   I   I   denotes the identity element. If    X  =  0      X  0    X=0   is chosen instead, then still e iX {{=}} I ∈ SO(3;1) + }} , but now I ∈ GL( U )}} .  This illustrates the double valued nature of a spin representation. The identity in gets mapped into either    -   I  ∈  G  L   (  U  )          I  normal-∈  G  L  U     -I∈GL(U)   or    I  ∈  G  L   (  U  )       I  normal-∈  G  L  U    I∈GL(U)   depending on the choice of Lie algebra element to represent it. In the first case, one can speculate that a rotation of an angle    2  π      2  π    2π   will turn a bispinor into minus itself, and that it requires a    4  π      4  π    4π   rotation to rotate a bispinor back into itself. What really happens is that the identity in is mapped to    -  I      I    -I   in    G  L   (  U  )       G  L  U    GL(U)   with an unfortunate choice of   X   X   X   .  It is impossible to continuously choose   X   X   X   for all so that   S   S   S   is a continuous representation. Suppose that one defines   S   S   S   along a loop in    S  O   (  3  ;  1  )       S  O   3  1     SO(3;1)   such that 2πtM 12 , 0 ≤ t ≤ 1}} . This is a closed loop in    S  O   (  3  ;  1  )       S  O   3  1     SO(3;1)   , i.e. rotations ranging from 0 to    2  π      2  π    2π   around the z-axis under the exponential mapping, but it is only "half"" a loop in    G  L   (  U  )       G  L  U    GL(U)   , ending at    -  I      I    -I   . In addition, the value of    I  ∈  S  O   (  3  ;  1  )       I  normal-∈  S  O   3  1     I∈SO(3;1)   is ambiguous, since    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   and    t  =   2  π       t    2  π     t=2π   gives different values for    I  ∈  S  O   (  3  ;  1  )       I  normal-∈  S  O   3  1     I∈SO(3;1)   .  The Dirac algebra  The representation   S   S   S   on bispinors will induce a representation of on    E  n  d   (  U  )       E  n  d  U    End(U)   , the set of linear operators on U . This space corresponds to the Clifford algebra itself so that all linear operators on U are elements of the latter. This representation, and how it decomposes as a direct sum of irreducible representations, is described in the article on Dirac algebra . One of the consequences is the decomposition of the bilinear forms on    U  ×  U      U  normal-×  U    U×U   . This decomposition hints how to couple any bispinor field with other fields in a Lagrangian to yield Lorentz scalars .
