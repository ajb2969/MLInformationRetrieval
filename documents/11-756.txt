N-feruloylglycine deacylase




N-feruloylglycine deacylase

In enzymology, a N-feruloylglycine deacylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-feruloylglycine + H2O 
 
 
 
  ferulate + glycine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-feruloylglycine and H2O, whereas its two products are ferulate and glycine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-feruloylglycine amidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called N-feruloylglycine hydrolase.
