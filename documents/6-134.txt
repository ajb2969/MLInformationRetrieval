   Ammonium hydrosulfide      Ammonium hydrosulfide   Ammonium hydrosulfide is the chemical compound with the formula (NH 4 )SH. It is the salt derived from the ammonium  cation and the hydrosulfide  anion . The salt exists as colourless, water-soluble, micaceous crystals. On Earth the compound is encountered mainly as a solution, not as the solid, but NH 4 SH ice is believed to be a substantial component of the cloud decks of the gas-giant planets Jupiter and Saturn , with sulfur produced by its photolysis responsible for the color of some of those planets' clouds. It can be generated by mixing hydrogen sulfide and ammonia .  Preparation  Solutions of ammonium hydrosulfide can be prepared by passing hydrogen sulfide gas through concentrated ammonia solution. 1 According to a detailed 1895 report, hydrogen sulfide reacts with concentrated aqueous ammonia solution at room temperature to give (NH 4 ) 2 S·2NH 4 HS. When this species is cooled to 0 °C and treated with additional hydrogen sulfide, one obtains (NH 4 ) 2 S·12NH 4 HS. 2 An ice-cold solution of this substance kept at 0 °C and having hydrogen sulfide continually passed through it gives the hydrosulfide.  The common " stink bomb " consists of an aqueous solution of ammonium sulfide. The mixture easily converts to ammonia and hydrogen sulfide gases. This conversion illustrates the ease of the following equilibrium:   (NH 4 )SH    ←  →     normal-→  normal-←    \overrightarrow{\leftarrow}   NH 3 + H 2 S   Both ammonia and hydrogen sulfide have a powerfully unpleasant smell.
