Stolz–Cesàro theorem

In mathematics, the Stolz–Cesàro theorem, named after mathematicians Otto Stolz and Ernesto Cesàro, is a criterion for proving the convergence of a sequence.
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be two sequences of real numbers. Assume that 
 
 
 
  is strictly monotone and divergent sequence (i.e. strictly increasing and approaches 
 
 
 
  or strictly decreasing and approaches 
 
 
 
 ) and the following limit exists:



Then, the limit



also exists and it is equal to ℓ.
The general form of the Stolz–Cesàro theorem is the following (see http://www.imomath.com/index.php?options=686): If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two sequences such that 
 
 
 
  is monotone and unbounded, then:



The Stolz–Cesàro theorem can be viewed as a generalization of the Cesàro mean, but also as a l'Hôpital's rule for sequences. The ∞/∞ case is stated and proved on pages 173—175 of Stolz's 1885 book S and also on page 54 of Cesàro's 1888 article C. It appears as Problem 70 in Pólya and Szegő.
