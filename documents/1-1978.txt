   Unbinilium      Unbinilium   Unbinilium , or eka - radium or element 120 , is the temporary, systematic element name of a hypothetical chemical element in the periodic table with the temporary symbol Ubn and the atomic number 120. Since unbinilium should be an alkaline earth metal , it may have properties similar to radium or barium .  Attempts to date to synthesize the element using fusion reactions at low excitation energy have met with failure, though there are reports that the fission of unbinilium nuclei at very high excitation has been successfully measured, indicating a strong shell effect at Z=120.  Attempts at synthesis  Neutron evaporation  Following the success in obtaining ununoctium by the reaction between 249 Cf and 48 Ca , the discoverers started similar experiments in hope of creating unbinilium (element 120) from nuclei of 58 Fe and 244 Pu . 1 Isotopes of unbinilium are predicted to have alpha decay half-lives of the order of microseconds . 2 3 In March–April 2007, the synthesis of unbinilium was attempted at the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna by bombarding a plutonium -244 target with iron -58 ions . 4 Initial analysis revealed that no atoms of element 120 were produced providing a limit of 400 fb for the cross section at the energy studied. 5         Pu   94  244     +  26  58   Fe    →  120  302    Ubn  *   →    𝑓𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛   𝑜𝑛𝑙𝑦         subscript   superscript  normal-→  302   120     subscript   superscript   58   26    superscript   subscript  Pu  94   244   Fe    superscript  Ubn      normal-→      𝑓𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑜𝑛𝑙𝑦      \,{}^{244}_{94}\mathrm{Pu}+\,^{58}_{26}\mathrm{Fe}\to\,^{302}_{120}\mathrm{Ubn%
 }^{*}\to\ \mathit{fission\ only}     The Russian team are planning to upgrade their facilities before attempting the reaction again. 6  In April 2007, the team at GSI attempted to create unbinilium using uranium -238 and nickel -64: 7         U   92  238     +  28  64   Ni    →  120  302    Ubn  *   →    𝑓𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛   𝑜𝑛𝑙𝑦         subscript   superscript  normal-→  302   120     subscript   superscript   64   28    superscript   subscript  normal-U  92   238   Ni    superscript  Ubn      normal-→      𝑓𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛  𝑜𝑛𝑙𝑦      \,{}^{238}_{92}\mathrm{U}+\,^{64}_{28}\mathrm{Ni}\to\,^{302}_{120}\mathrm{Ubn}%
 ^{*}\to\ \mathit{fission\ only}     No atoms were detected providing a limit of 1.6 pb on the cross section at the energy provided. The GSI repeated the experiment with higher sensitivity in three separate runs from April–May 2007, Jan–March 2008, and Sept–Oct 2008, all with negative results and providing a cross section limit of 90 fb. 8  In June–July 2010, scientists at the GSI attempted the fusion reaction: 9         Cm   96  248     +  24  54   Cr    →  120  302    Ubn  *       subscript   superscript  normal-→  302   120     subscript   superscript   54   24    superscript   subscript  Cm  96   248   Cr    superscript  Ubn      \,{}^{248}_{96}\mathrm{Cm}+\,^{54}_{24}\mathrm{Cr}\to\,^{302}_{120}\mathrm{Ubn%
 }^{*}     They were unable to detect any atoms, but exact details are not currently available. 10  In August–October 2011, a different team at the GSI using the TASCA facility tried the new reaction: 11         Cf   98  249     +  22  50   Ti    →  120  299    Ubn  *       subscript   superscript  normal-→  299   120     subscript   superscript   50   22    superscript   subscript  Cf  98   249   Ti    superscript  Ubn      \,{}^{249}_{98}\mathrm{Cf}+\,^{50}_{22}\mathrm{Ti}\to\,^{299}_{120}\mathrm{Ubn%
 }^{*}     Results from this experiment are not yet available. 12  Compound nucleus fission  Unbinilium is of interest because it is part of the hypothesized island of stability , with the compound nucleus  302 Ubn being the most stable of those that can be created directly by current methods. It has been calculated that Z=120 may in fact be the next proton magic number, rather than at Z=114 or 126.  Several experiments have been performed between 2000–2008 at the Flerov laboratory of Nuclear Reactions in Dubna studying the fission characteristics of the compound nucleus 302 Ubn. Two nuclear reactions have been used, namely 244 Pu+ 58 Fe and 238 U+ 64 Ni. The results have revealed how nuclei such as this fission predominantly by expelling closed shell nuclei such as 132 Sn (Z=50, N=82). It was also found that the yield for the fusion-fission pathway was similar between 48 Ca and 58 Fe projectiles, indicating a possible future use of 58 Fe projectiles in superheavy element formation. 13  In 2008, the team at GANIL, France, described the results from a new technique which attempts to measure the fission half-life of a compound nucleus at high excitation energy, since the yields are significantly higher than from neutron evaporation channels. It is also a useful method for probing the effects of shell closures on the survivability of compound nuclei in the super-heavy region, which can indicate the exact position of the next proton shell (Z=114, 120, 124, or 126). The team studied the nuclear fusion reaction between uranium ions and a target of natural nickel:            U   92  238     +  28   n  a  t    Ni    →   296  ,  298  ,  299  ,  300  ,  302     Ubn  *   →  𝑓𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛   .        superscript  normal-→   296  298  299  300  302      subscript   superscript     n  a  t    28    superscript   subscript  normal-U  92   238   Ni    superscript  Ubn      normal-→    𝑓𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛     \,{}^{238}_{92}\mathrm{U}+\,^{nat}_{28}\mathrm{Ni}\to\,^{296,298,299,300,302}%
 \mathrm{Ubn}^{*}\to\ \mathit{fission}.        The results indicated that nuclei of unbinilium were produced at high (~70 MeV) excitation energy which underwent fission with measurable half-lives > 10 −18 s. Although very short (indeed, insufficient for the element to be considered by IUPAC to exist), the ability to measure such a process indicates a strong shell effect at Z=120. At lower excitation energy (see neutron evaporation), the effect of the shell will be enhanced and ground-state nuclei can be expected to have relatively long half-lives. This result could partially explain the relatively long half-life of 294 Uuo measured in experiments at Dubna. Similar experiments have indicated a similar phenomenon at Z=124 (see unbiquadium ) but not for flerovium , suggesting that the next proton shell does in fact lie at Z>120. 14 15  Future reactions  The team at RIKEN have begun a program utilizing 248 Cm targets and have indicated future experiments to probe the possibility of Z=120 being the next magic number using the aforementioned nuclear reactions to form 302 Ubn. 16  Calculated decay characteristics  In a quantum tunneling model with mass estimates from a macroscopic-microscopic model, the alpha-decay half-lives of several unbinilium isotopes ( 292–304 Ubn) have been predicted to be around 1–20 microseconds. 17 18 19 20  Extrapolated chemical properties  Unbinilium should be highly reactive, according to periodic trends, as this element is in the same periodic table column as the alkaline earth metals . It would be much more reactive than any other lighter elements of this group. If group reactivity is followed, this element would react violently in air to form an oxide (UbnO), in water to form the hydroxide, which would be a strong base and highly explosive in terms of flammability, and with the halogens to form salts (such as UbnCl 2 ). 21  Although unbinilium is expected to behave typically for an alkaline earth metal, showing a strong +2 oxidation state , the energetic properties of its valence electrons would increase its ionization energies ; hence, unbinilium may have a lower metallic and ionic radius than expected, and may behave more similarly to calcium and strontium than barium or radium . 22 Unbinilium is also predicted to be the first alkaline earth metal to display the +4 oxidation state, due to the ionization energy of the 7p 3/2 electrons, which is predicted to be very low. 23 The +1 state may also be stable in isolation. 24  ==Target-projectile combinations leading to Z=120 compound nuclei== The below table contains various combinations of targets and projectiles which could be used to form compound nuclei with an atomic number of 120.
