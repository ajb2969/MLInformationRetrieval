   Hadamard regularization      Hadamard regularization   In mathematics, Hadamard regularization (also called Hadamard finite part or Hadamard's partie finie ) is a method of regularizing divergent integrals by dropping some divergent terms and keeping the finite part, introduced by .  showed that this can be interpreted as taking the meromorphic continuation of a convergent integral.  If the Cauchy principal value integral  $$\mathcal{C}\int_a^b \frac{f(t)}{t-x} \, dt \quad (\hbox{for } a exists, then it may be differentiated with respect to $x$ to obtain the Hadamard finite part integral as follows:
 
 : \frac{d}{dx} \left(\mathcal{C}\int_{a}^{b} \frac{f(t)}{t-x} \,dt\right)=\mathcal{H}\int_a^b \frac{f(t)}{(t-x)^2}\, dt \quad (\hbox{for } a Note that the symbols \mathcal{C}$$ and $\mathcal{H}$ are used here to denote Cauchy principal value and Hadamard finite-part integrals respectively.  The Hadamard finite part integral above (for $a ) may also be given by the following equivalent definitions:  $$\mathcal{H}\int_a^b \frac{f(t)}{(t-x)^2}\, dt = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} \left\{ \int_a^{x-\varepsilon}\frac{f(t)}{(t-x)^2}\,dt + \int_{x+\varepsilon}^b\frac{f(t)}{(t-x)^2}\,dt -\frac{2f(x)}{\varepsilon}\right\},$$  $$\mathcal{H}\int_a^b \frac{f(t)}{(t-x)^2}\, dt = \lim_{\varepsilon \to 0^+} \left\{ \int_a^{b}\frac{(t-x)^{2}f(t)}
 {((t-x)^2+\varepsilon^2)^2}\,dt -\frac{\pi f(x)}{2\varepsilon}-\frac{f(x)}{2}(\frac{1}{b-x}-\frac{1}{a-x})\right\}.$$  The definitions above may be derived by assuming that the function $f ( t )$ is differentiable infinitely many times at $t = x for a , that is, by assuming that $f ( t )$ can be represented by its Taylor series about $t = x$ . For details, see . (Note that the term $− f\frac{(}{x} ( 1\frac{b}{−} − 1\frac{a}{−} )$ in the second equivalent definition above is missing in  but this is corrected in the errata sheet of the book.)  Integral equations containing Hadamard finite part integrals (with $f ( t )$ unknown) are termed hypersingular integral equations. Hypersingular integral equations arise in the formulation of many problems in mechanics, such as in fracture analysis.  References    .   .   .   .   .   .
