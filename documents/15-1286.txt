   TRNA (cytidine56-2'-O)-methyltransferase      TRNA (cytidine56-2'-O)-methyltransferase   tRNA (cytidine56-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, aTrm 56 , tRNA ribose 2'-O-methyltransferase aTrm 56 , PAB1040 (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytidine56-2'-O)-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine 56 in tRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine 56 in tRNA   The archaeal enzyme specifically catalyses the S-adenosyl-L-methionine dependent 2'-O-ribose methylation of cytidine at position 56 in tRNA transcripts.
