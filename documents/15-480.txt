Determinant identities

In mathematics the determinant is an operator which has certain useful identities.
Identities


 
  where In is the  identity matrix.




For square matrices A and B of equal size,










 
  for an  matrix.
If A is a triangular matrix, i.e.  whenever  or, alternatively, whenever , then its determinant equals the product of the diagonal entries: 
 
 

Schur complement
The following identity holds for a Schur complement of a square matrix:
The Schur complement arises as the result of performing a block Gaussian elimination by multiplying the matrix M from the right with the "block lower triangular" matrix



Here Ip denotes a p×p identity matrix. After multiplication with the matrix L the Schur complement appears in the upper p×p block. The product matrix is


 
 
  That is, we have shown that
