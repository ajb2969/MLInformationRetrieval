   Rational set      Rational set   In computer science , more precisely in automata theory, a rational set of a monoid is an element of the minimal class of subsets of this monoid which contains all finite subsets and is closed under union , product and Kleene star . Rational sets are useful in automata theory , formal languages and algebra .  A rational set generalizes the notion of rational (regular) language (understood as defined by regular expressions ) to monoids that are not necessarily free .  Definition  Let   N   N   N   be a monoid . The set    RAT   (  N  )       RAT  N    \mathrm{RAT}(N)   of rational subsets of   N   N   N   is the smallest set that contains every finite set and is closed under   union : if     A  ,  B   ∈   RAT   (  N  )         A  B     RAT  N     A,B\in\mathrm{RAT}(N)   then     A  ∪  B   ∈   RAT   (  N  )          A  B     RAT  N     A\cup B\in\mathrm{RAT}(N)     product: if     A  ,  B   ∈   RAT   (  N  )         A  B     RAT  N     A,B\in\mathrm{RAT}(N)   then     A  ×  B   =   {   a  ×  b   ∣    a  ∈  A   ,   b  ∈  B    }   ∈   RAT   (  N  )            A  B    conditional-set    a  b    formulae-sequence    a  A     b  B            RAT  N      A\times B=\{a\times b\mid a\in A,b\in B\}\in\mathrm{RAT}(N)     Kleene star if    A  ∈   RAT   (  N  )        A    RAT  N     A\in\mathrm{RAT}(N)   then     A  *   =    ⋃   i  =  1   ∞    A  i    ∈   RAT   (  N  )           superscript  A      superscript   subscript     i  1       superscript  A  i           RAT  N      A^{*}=\bigcup_{i=1}^{\infty}A^{i}\in\mathrm{RAT}(N)   where     A  1   =  A       superscript  A  1   A    A^{1}=A   and     A   n  +  1    =    A  n   ×  A        superscript  A    n  1       superscript  A  n   A     A^{n+1}=A^{n}\times A   .   This means that any rational subset of   N   N   N   can be obtained by taking a finite number of finite subsets of   N   N   N   and applying the union, product and Kleene star operations a finite number of times.  In general a rational subset of a monoid need not form a submonoid of the monoid.  Example  Let   A   A   A   be an alphabet , the set    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   of words over   A   A   A   is a monoid. The rational subset of    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   are precisely the regular languages . Indeed this language may be defined by a finite regular expression .  The rational subsets of   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   are the ultimately periodic sets of integers. More generally, the rational subsets of    ℕ  k     superscript  ℕ  k    \mathbb{N}^{k}   are the semilinear sets . 1  Properties  McKnight's theorem states that if   N   N   N   is finitely generated then its recognizable subset are rational sets. This is not true in general, i.e.    RAT   (  N  )       RAT  N    \mathrm{RAT}(N)   is not closed under complement . Let    N  =     {  a  }   *   ×    {  b  ,  c  }   *        N     superscript   a      superscript   b  c        N=\{a\}^{*}\times\{b,c\}^{*}   , the sets    U  =   {   (   a  n   ,    b  n    c  m    )   ∣    n  ,  m   ∈  ℕ   }       U   conditional-set    superscript  a  n      superscript  b  n    superscript  c  m        n  m   ℕ      U=\{(a^{n},b^{n}c^{m})\mid n,m\in\mathbb{N}\}   and    V  =   {   (   a  n   ,    b  m    c  n    )   ∣    n  ,  m   ∈  ℕ   }       V   conditional-set    superscript  a  n      superscript  b  m    superscript  c  n        n  m   ℕ      V=\{(a^{n},b^{m}c^{n})\mid n,m\in\mathbb{N}\}   are recognizable but    W  =   U  ∩  V   =   {   (   a  n   ,    b  n    c  n    )   ∣   n  ∈  ℕ   }         W    U  V         conditional-set    superscript  a  n      superscript  b  n    superscript  c  n       n  ℕ       W=U\cap V=\{(a^{n},b^{n}c^{n})\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}   is not because its projection to the second element    {    b  n    m  n    ∣   n  ∈  ℕ   }     conditional-set     superscript  b  n    superscript  m  n      n  ℕ     \{b^{n}m^{n}\mid n\in\mathbb{N}\}   is not rational.  The intersection of a rational subset and of a recognizable subset is rational.  Rational sets are closed under morphism: given   N   N   N   and   M   M   M   two monoids and    ϕ  :   N  →  M      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  N  M     \phi:N\rightarrow M   a morphism, if    S  ∈   RAT   (  N  )        S    RAT  N     S\in\mathrm{RAT}(N)   then     ϕ   (  S  )    =   {   ϕ   (  x  )    ∣   x  ∈  S   }   ∈   RAT   (  M  )            ϕ  S    conditional-set    ϕ  x     x  S           RAT  M      \phi(S)=\{\phi(x)\mid x\in S\}\in\mathrm{RAT}(M)   .  For finite groups the following result of Anissimov and Seifert is well known: a subgroup  H of a finitely generated group  G is recognizable if and only if H has finite index in G . In contrast, H is rational if and only if H is finitely generated. 2  Rational relations and rational functions  A binary relation between monoids M and N is a rational relation if the graph of the relation, regarded as a subset of M × N is a rational set in the product monoid. A function from M to N is a rational function if the graph of the function is a rational set. 3  See also   Rational series  Recognizable set  Rational monoid   References    Jean-Eric Pin, Mathematical Foundations of Automata Theory , Chapter IV: Recognisable and rational sets  Rational Sets in Commutative Monoids   Further reading     "  Category:Automata theory     Mathematical Foundations of Automata Theory ↩   preprint ↩  ↩
