   Slowed rotor      Slowed rotor   (Figure)  size=334px|right|The McDonnell XV-1 could slow its rotor from 410 to 180 RPM   Slowed rotor is a concept in designing and flying certain rotorcraft . Reducing the rotational speed of the rotor reduces the drag , enabling the aircraft to go faster and/or fly more economically.  Background  Rotors of conventional helicopters are designed to operate in a narrow range of RPM , 1 2 3 4 5 6 causing suboptimal operation in large parts of the flight envelope . 7  Two main issues restrict the speed of rotorcraft: 8 9 10 11 12    Retreating blade stall . As the helicopter goes faster, the retreating blade sees slow air while the advancing blade sees fast air. If not counteracted by flapping , 13 this would cause dissymmetry of lift and eventually retreating blade stall, 14 15 16 17 and blade stability suffers as the blade reaches its limits for flapping. 18 19    Air compressibility near the rotor blade tip. The advancing blade tip may approach the speed of sound where compressibility effects prevent further increase in speed . 20 21 22 23   These (and other) 24 25 problems limit the practical speed of helicopters to around . 26 27 28 29 30 At the extreme, the theoretical top speed for a rotary winged aircraft is about , 31 close to the current official speed record for a conventional helicopter held by a Westland Lynx , which flew at  in 1986 32 and its blade tips were nearly Mach 1. 33  Theory  For rotorcrafts, "Advance ratio" (or Mu, symbol   μ   μ   \mu   ) is defined as the aircraft forward speed V divided by its relative blade tip speed. 34 35 36 Maximum mu is a critical design factor for rotorcraft, 37 and the optimum for traditional helicopters is around 0.4. 38 39  The "relative blade tip speed" u is the tip speed relative to the aircraft (not the airspeed of the tip). Thus the formula for Advance ratio is      μ  =   V  u   =   V   Ω  ⋅  R          μ    V  u          V   normal-⋅  normal-Ω  R       \mu=\frac{V}{u}=\frac{V}{\Omega\cdot R}   where Omega (Ω) is the rotor's angular velocity , and R is the rotor radius (about the length of one rotor blade) 40 41 42  When the rotor blade is perpendicular to the aircraft and advancing, its tip airspeed V t is the aircraft speed plus relative blade tip speed, or V t = V + u . 43 44 At mu=1, V is equal to u and the tip airspeed is twice the aircraft speed.  At the same position on the opposite side (retreating blade), the tip airspeed is the aircraft speed minus relative blade tip speed, or V t = V - u . At mu=1, the tip airspeed is zero. 45 46 At a mu between 0.7 to 1.0, most of the retreating side has reverse airflow. 47  Although rotor characteristics are fundamental to rotorcraft performance, 48 little public analytical and experimental knowledge exists between advance ratios of 0.45 to 1.0, 49 50 and none is known above 1.0. 51 52  Computer simulations are not capable of adequate predictions at high mu. 53 The region of reverse flow on the retreating blade is not well understood, 54 however some research have been conducted. 55  The profile drag of a rotor corresponds to the cube of its rotational speed . 56 57 Reducing the rotational speed is therefore a significant reduction of rotor drag, allowing higher aircraft speed 58 or lower power consumption.  Aircraft  Traditional helicopters get both their propulsion and lift from the main rotor, and by using a dedicated propulsion device such as a propeller or jet engine , the rotor burden is lessened. 59 If wings are also used to lift the aircraft, the rotor can be unloaded (partially or fully) and its rotational speed further reduced, enabling higher aircraft speed. Compound helicopters use these methods, 60 but the Boeing A160 Hummingbird shows that rotor-slowing is possible without wings or propellers, and regular helicopters may reduce rotor speed to 85% using 19% less power. Alternatively, research suggests that twin-engine helicopters may decrease consumption by 30% 61 -40% when running only one engine, given adequate height and velocity well inside the safe areas of the height–velocity diagram . 62  As of 2012, no compound or hybrid wing/rotor (manned) aircraft has been produced in quantity, and only a few have been flown as experimental aircraft, 63 mainly because the increased complexities have not been justified by military or civilian markets. 64 Varying the rotor speed may induce severe vibrations at specific resonance frequencies. 65  Contra-rotating rotors like on Sikorsky X2 solve the problem of lift dissymmetry by having both left and right sides provide near equal lift with less flapping. 66 67 The X2 deals with the compressibility issue by reducing its rotor speed 68 from 446 to 360 RPM 69 70 to keep the advancing blade tip below the sound barrier when going above 200 knots. 71  List of slowed rotor aircraft  Sorted by year.
