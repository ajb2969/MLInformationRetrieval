   2,4'-dihydroxyacetophenone dioxygenase      2,4'-dihydroxyacetophenone dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 2,4'-dihydroxyacetophenone dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,4'-dihydroxyacetophenone + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxybenzoate + formate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2,4'-dihydroxyacetophenone and O 2 , whereas its two products are 4-hydroxybenzoate and formate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,4'-dihydroxyacetophenone oxidoreductase (C-C-bond-cleaving) . This enzyme is also called (4-hydroxybenzoyl)methanol oxygenase . This enzyme participates in bisphenol a degradation .  References     "  Category:EC 1.13.11  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
