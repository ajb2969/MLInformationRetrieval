   Krull ring      Krull ring   In commutative algebra, a Krull ring or Krull domain is a commutative ring with a well behaved theory of prime factorization. They were introduced by . They are a higher-dimensional generalization of Dedekind domains , which are exactly the Krull domains of dimension at most 1.  In this article, a ring is commutative and has unity.  Formal definition  Let   A   A   A   be an integral domain and let   P   P   P   be the set of all prime ideals of   A   A   A   of height one, that is, the set of all prime ideals properly containing no nonzero prime ideal. Then   A   A   A   is a Krull ring if       A  ùî≠     subscript  A  ùî≠    A_{\mathfrak{p}}   is a discrete valuation ring for all    ùî≠  ‚àà  P      ùî≠  P    \mathfrak{p}\in P   ,     A   A   A   is the intersection of these discrete valuation rings (considered as subrings of the quotient field of   A   A   A   ).  Any nonzero element of   A   A   A   is contained in only a finite number of height 1 prime ideals.   Properties  A Krull domain is a unique factorization domain if and only if every prime ideal of height one is principal. 1  Let A be a Zariski ring (e.g., a local noetherian ring). If the completion    A  ^     normal-^  A    \widehat{A}   is a Krull domain, then A is a Krull domain. 2  Examples   Every integrally closed  noetherian  domain is a Krull ring. In particular, Dedekind domains are Krull rings. Conversely Krull rings are integrally closed, so a Noetherian domain is Krull if and only if it is integrally closed.  If   A   A   A   is a Krull ring then so is the polynomial ring     A   [  x  ]       A   delimited-[]  x     A[x]   and the formal power series ring     A   [   [  x  ]   ]       A   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  x      A[[x]]   .  The polynomial ring    R   [   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   ,  ‚Ä¶  ]       R    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3   normal-‚Ä¶     R[x_{1},x_{2},x_{3},\ldots]   in infinitely many variables over a unique factorization domain    R   R   R   is a Krull ring which is not noetherian. In general, any unique factorization domain is a Krull ring.  Let   A   A   A   be a Noetherian  domain with quotient field    K   K   K   , and   L   L   L   be a finite algebraic extension of   K   K   K   . Then the integral closure of   A   A   A   in   L   L   L   is a Krull ring ( Mori‚ÄìNagata theorem ). 3   The divisor class group of a Krull ring  A (Weil) divisor of a Krull ring A is a formal integral linear combination of the height 1 prime ideals, and these form a group D ( A ). A divisor of the form div( x ) for some non-zero x in A is called a principal divisor, and the principal divisors form a subgroup of the group of divisors. The quotient of the group of divisors by the subgroup of principal divisors is called the divisor class group of A .  A Cartier divisor of a Krull ring is a locally principal (Weil) divisor. The Cartier divisors form a subgroup of the group of divisors containing the principal divisors. The quotient of the Cartier divisors by the principal divisors is a subgroup of the divisor class group, isomorphic to the Picard group of invertible sheaves on Spec( A ).  Example: in the ring k [ x , y , z ]/( xy ‚Äì z 2 ] the divisor class group has order 2, generated by the divisor y = z , but the Picard subgroup is the trivial group.
