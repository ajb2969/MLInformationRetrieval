   Pyrimidine-deoxynucleoside 1'-dioxygenase      Pyrimidine-deoxynucleoside 1'-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a pyrimidine-deoxynucleoside 1'-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2'-deoxyuridine + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   uracil + 2-deoxyribonolactone + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2'-deoxyuridine , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 4 products are uracil , 2-deoxyribonolactone , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2'-deoxyuridine,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (1'-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called deoxyuridine-uridine 1'-dioxygenase . It has 2 cofactors : iron , and Ascorbate .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.11  Category:Iron enzymes  Category:Ascorbate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
