Log-space transducer

A log space transducer (LST) is a type of Turing machine used for log-space reductions.
A log space transducer, 
 
 
 
 , has three tapes:

A read-only input tape.
A read/write work tape (bounded to at most 
 
 
 
  symbols).
A write-only, write-once output tape.



 
  will be designed to compute a log-space computable function

 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is the alphabet of both the input and output tapes). If 
 
 
 
  is executed with 
 
 
 
  on its input tape, when the machine halts, it will have 
 
 
 
  remaining on its output tape.
A language 
 
 
 
  is said to be log-space reducible to a language 
 
 
 
  if there exists a log-space computable function, 
 
 
 
 , which will convert an input from problem 
 
 
 
  into an input to problem 
 
 
 
 . I.E. 
 
 
 
 .
This seems like a rather convoluted idea, but it has two useful properties that are desirable for a reduction:

The property of transitivity holds. (A reduces to B and B reduces to C implies A reduces to C).
If A reduces to B, and B is in L, then we know A is in L.

Transitivity holds because it is possible to feed the output tape of one reducer (A->B) to another (B->C). At first glance, this seems incorrect because the A->C reducer needs to store the output tape from the A->B reducer onto the work tape in order to feed it into the B->C reducer, but this is not true. Each time the B->C reducer needs to access its input tape, the A->C reducer can re-run the A->B reducer, and so the output of the A->B reducer never needs to be stored entirely at once.
