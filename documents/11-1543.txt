   N-acetylglucosamine kinase      N-acetylglucosamine kinase   In enzymology , a N-acetylglucosamine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine , whereas its two products are ADP and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:N-acetyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include acetylglucosamine kinase (phosphorylating) , ATP:2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase , 2-acetylamino-2-deoxy-D-glucose kinase , and acetylaminodeoxyglucokinase . This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and aminosugars metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
