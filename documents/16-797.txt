Four-spiral semigroup
In [[mathematics]], the  '''four-spiral semigroup''' is a special [[semigroup]] generated by four [[idempotent]] elements. This special semigroup was first studied by Karl Byleen in a doctoral dissertation submitted to the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1977.{{cite book|last=Byleen, K.|title=''The Structure of Regular and Inverse Semigroups'', Doctoral Dissertation|year=1977|pub
 lisher=University of Nebraska}}1 It has several interesting properties: it is one of the most important examples of bi-simple but not completely-simple semigroups;2 it is also an important example of a fundamental regular semigroup;3 it is an indispensable building block of bisimple, idempotent-generated regular semigroups.4 A certain semigroup, called double four-spiral semigroup, generated by five idempotent elements has also been studied along with the four-spiral semigroup.56
Definition
The four-spiral semigroup, denoted by Sp4, is the free semigroup generated by four elements a, b, c, and d satisfying the following eleven conditions:7
:* a2 = a, b2 = b, c2 = c, d2 = d.
:* ab = b, ba = a, bc = b, cb = c, cd = d, dc = c.
:* da = d.
The first set of conditions imply that the elements a, b, c, d are idempotents. The second set of conditions imply that a R b L c R d where R and L are the Green's relations in a semigroup. The lone condition in the third set can be written as d ωl a, where ωl is a biorder relation defined by Nambooripad. The diagram below summarises the various relations among a, b, c, d:

General elements
Every element of Sp4 can be written uniquely in one of the following forms:9


[c] (ac)m [a]
 
[d] (bd)n [b]
 
[c] (ac)m ad (bd)n [b]
 



where m and n are non-negative integers and terms in square brackets may be omitted as long as the remaining product is not empty. The forms of these elements imply that Sp4 has a partition Sp4 = A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D ∪ E where


A = { a(ca)n, (bd)n+1, a(ca)md(bd)n : m, n non-negative integers }
 
B = { (ac)n+1, b(db)n, a(ca)m(db) n+1 : m, n non-negative integers }
 
C = { c(ac)m, (db)n+1, (ca)m+1(db)n+1 : m, n non-negative integers }
 
D = { d(bd)n, (ca)m+1(db)n+1d : m, n non-negative integers }
 
E = { (ca)m : m positive integer }
 



The sets A, B, C, D are bicyclic semigroups, E is an infinite cyclic semigroup and the subsemigroup D ∪ E is a nonregular semigroup.
Idempotent elements
The set of idempotents of Sp4,10 is {an, bn, cn, dn : n = 0, 1, 2 ,...} where, a0 = a, b0 = b, c0 = c, d0 = d, and for n = 0, 1, 2 ,....,


an+1 = a(ca)n(db)nd

bn+1 = a(ca)n(db)n+1

cn+1 = (ca)n+1(db)n+1

dn+1 = (ca)n+1(db)n+ld




The sets of idempotents in the subsemigroups A, B, C, D (there are no idempotents in the subsemigoup E) are respectively:


EA = { an : n = 0,1,2, ... }
 
EB = { bn : n = 0,1,2, ... }
 
EC = { cn : n = 0,1,2, ... }
 
ED = { dn : n = 0,1,2, ... }
 



Four-spiral semigroup as a Rees-matrix semigroup
Let S be the set of all quadruples (r, x, y, s) where r, s, ∈ { 0, 1 } and x and y are nonnegative integers and define a binary operation in S by



The set S with this operation is a Rees matrix semigroup over the bicyclic semigroup, and the four-spiral semigroup Sp4 is isomorphic to S.11
Properties

By definition itself, the four-spiral semigroup is an idempotent generated semigroup (Sp4 is generated by the four idempotents a, b. c, d.)
The four-spiral semigroup is a fundamental semigroup, that is, the only congruence on Sp4 which is contained in the Green's relation H in Sp4 is the equality relation.

Double four-spiral semigroup
The fundamental double four-spiral semigroup, denoted by DSp4, is the semigroup generated by five elements a, b, c, d, e satisfying the following conditions:1213
:*a2 = a, b2 = b, c2 = c, d2 = d, e2 = e
:*ab = b, ba = a, bc = b, cb = c, cd = d, dc = c, de = d, ed = e
:*ae = e, ea = e
The first set of conditions imply that the elements a, b, c, d, e are idempotents. The second set of conditions state the Green's relations among these idempotents, namely, a R b L c R d L e. The two conditions in the third set imply that e ω a where ω is the biorder relation defined as ω = ωl ∩ ωr.
