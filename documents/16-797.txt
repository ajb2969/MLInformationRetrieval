   Four-spiral semigroup      Four-spiral semigroup  In [[mathematics]], the  '''four-spiral semigroup''' is a special [[semigroup]] generated by four [[idempotent]] elements. This special semigroup was first studied by Karl Byleen in a doctoral dissertation submitted to the [[University of Nebraska]] in 1977. {{cite book|last=Byleen, K.|title=''The Structure of Regular and Inverse Semigroups'', Doctoral Dissertation|year=1977|pub lisher=University of Nebraska}} 1 It has several interesting properties: it is one of the most important examples of bi-simple but not completely-simple semigroups; 2 it is also an important example of a fundamental regular semigroup ; 3 it is an indispensable building block of bisimple, idempotent-generated regular semigroups. 4 A certain semigroup, called double four-spiral semigroup , generated by five idempotent elements has also been studied along with the four-spiral semigroup. 5 6  Definition  The four-spiral semigroup, denoted by Sp 4 , is the free semigroup generated by four elements a , b , c , and d satisfying the following eleven conditions: 7  :* a 2 = a , b 2 = b , c 2 = c , d 2 = d .  :* ab = b , ba = a , bc = b , cb = c , cd = d , dc = c .  :* da = d .  The first set of conditions imply that the elements a , b , c , d are idempotents. The second set of conditions imply that a R b L c R d where R and L are the Green's relations in a semigroup. The lone condition in the third set can be written as d ω l  a , where ω l is a biorder relation defined by Nambooripad . The diagram below summarises the various relations among a , b , c , d :              ℛ               a    ⟷    b          ω  l     ↑       ↕    ℒ         d    ⟷    c               ℛ              absent  absent  ℛ  absent  absent    absent  a  normal-⟷  b  absent     superscript  ω  l   normal-↑  absent  normal-↕  ℒ    absent  d  normal-⟷  c  absent    absent  absent  ℛ  absent  absent     \begin{matrix}&&\mathcal{R}&&\\

In this diagram, elements in the same row are R-related , elements in the same column are L-related , and the order proceeds down the four diagonals (away from the center).   (Figure)  The structure of the four-spiral semigroup Sp4. The set of idempotents (red coloured points) and the subsemigroups A, B, C, D, E are shown. 8   General elements  Every element of Sp 4 can be written uniquely in one of the following forms: 9    [ c ] ( ac ) m [a]  [ d ] ( bd ) n [ b ]  [ c ] ( ac ) m  ad ( bd ) n [ b ]     where m and n are non-negative integers and terms in square brackets may be omitted as long as the remaining product is not empty. The forms of these elements imply that Sp 4 has a partition  Sp 4 = A ∪ B ∪ C ∪ D ∪ E where    A = { a ( ca ) n , ( bd ) n +1 , a ( ca ) m d ( bd ) n : m , n non-negative integers }  B = { ( ac ) n +1 , b ( db ) n , a ( ca ) m ( db ) n +1 : m , n non-negative integers }  C = { c ( ac ) m , ( db ) n +1 , ( ca ) m +1 ( db ) n +1 : m , n non-negative integers }  D = { d ( bd ) n , ( ca ) m +1 ( db ) n +1 d : m , n non-negative integers }  E = { ( ca ) m : m positive integer }     The sets A , B , C , D are bicyclic semigroups , E is an infinite cyclic semigroup and the subsemigroup D ∪ E is a nonregular semigroup .  Idempotent elements  The set of idempotents of Sp 4 , 10 is { a n , b n , c n , d n : n = 0, 1, 2 ,...} where, a 0 = a , b 0 = b , c 0 = c , d 0 = d , and for n = 0, 1, 2 ,....,    a n +1 = a ( ca ) n ( db ) n d   b n +1 = a ( ca ) n ( db ) n +1   c n +1 = ( ca ) n +1 ( db ) n +1   d n +1 = ( ca ) n +1 ( db ) n +l d      The sets of idempotents in the subsemigroups A , B , C , D (there are no idempotents in the subsemigoup E ) are respectively:    E A = { a n : n = 0,1,2, ... }  E B = { b n : n = 0,1,2, ... }  E C = { c n : n = 0,1,2, ... }  E D = { d n : n = 0,1,2, ... }     Four-spiral semigroup as a Rees-matrix semigroup  Let S be the set of all quadruples ( r , x , y , s ) where r , s , ∈ { 0, 1 } and x and y are nonnegative integers and define a binary operation in S by        (  r  ,  x  ,  y  ,  s  )   *   (  t  ,  z  ,  w  ,  u  )    =   {      (  r  ,    x  -  y   +   max   (  y  ,   z  +  1   )     ,     max   (   y  -  1   ,  z  )    -  z   +  w   ,  u  )        if  s   =  0   ,   t  =  1         (  r  ,    x  -  y   +   max   (  y  ,  z  )     ,     max   (  y  ,  z  )    -  z   +  w   ,  u  )     otherwise.             r  x  y  s    t  z  w  u     cases   r      x  y     y    z  1             y  1   z   z   w   u    formulae-sequence      if  s   0     t  1     r      x  y     y  z          y  z   z   w   u   otherwise.     (r,x,y,s)*(t,z,w,u)=\begin{cases}(r,x-y+\max(y,z+1),\max(y-1,z)-z+w,u)&\text{%
 if }s=0,t=1\\
 (r,x-y+\max(y,z),\max(y,z)-z+w,u)&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}     The set S with this operation is a Rees matrix semigroup over the bicyclic semigroup , and the four-spiral semigroup Sp 4 is isomorphic to S . 11  Properties   By definition itself, the four-spiral semigroup is an idempotent generated semigroup ( Sp 4 is generated by the four idempotents a , b . c , d .)  The four-spiral semigroup is a fundamental semigroup, that is, the only congruence on Sp 4 which is contained in the Green's relation H in Sp 4 is the equality relation.   Double four-spiral semigroup  The fundamental double four-spiral semigroup , denoted by DSp 4 , is the semigroup generated by five elements a , b , c , d , e satisfying the following conditions: 12 13  :* a 2 = a , b 2 = b , c 2 = c , d 2 = d , e 2 = e  :* ab = b , ba = a , bc = b , cb = c , cd = d , dc = c , de = d , ed = e  :* ae = e , ea = e  The first set of conditions imply that the elements a , b , c , d , e are idempotents. The second set of conditions state the Green's relations among these idempotents, namely, a R b L c R d L e . The two conditions in the third set imply that e ω a where ω is the biorder relation defined as ω = ω l ∩ ω r .  References  "  Category:Semigroup theory     ↩  ↩         ↩    ↩
