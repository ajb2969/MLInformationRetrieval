Lactotriaosylceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase

Lactotriaosylceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase (, beta4Gal-T4, UDP-galactose:N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide beta-1,4-galactosyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name UDP-alpha-D-galactose:N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide 4-beta-D-galactosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-alpha-D-galactose + N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide 
 
 
 
  UDP + beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-galactosaminyl-(1->3)-beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-beta-D-glucosyl-(11)-ceramide
