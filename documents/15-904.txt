Phycoerythrobilin synthase (, PebS) is an enzyme with system name (3Z)-phycoerythrobilin:ferredoxin oxidoreductase (from biliverdin IX alpha).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(3Z)-phycoerythrobilin + 2 oxidized ferredoxin

biliverdin IX alpha + 2 reduced ferredoxin
 

This enzyme, from a cyanophage infecting oceanic cyanobacteria of the Prochlorococcus genus.
