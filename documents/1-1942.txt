   Chirp      Chirp   A chirp is a signal in which the frequency increases ('up-chirp') or decreases ('down-chirp') with time. In some sources, the term chirp is used interchangeably with sweep signal . 1 It is commonly used in sonar and radar , but has other applications, such as in spread spectrum communications. In spread spectrum usage, SAW devices such as RACs are often used to generate and demodulate the chirped signals. In optics , ultrashort  laser pulses also exhibit chirp, which, in optical transmission systems interacts with the dispersion properties of the materials, increasing or decreasing total pulse dispersion as the signal propagates. The name is a reference to the chirping sound made by birds; see bird vocalization .  Types of chirp  Linear chirp    In a linear chirp, the instantaneous frequency     f   (  t  )       f  t    f(t)   varies linearly with time:       f   (  t  )    =    f  0   +   k  t          f  t      subscript  f  0     k  t      f(t)=f_{0}+kt     where    f  0     subscript  f  0    f_{0}   is the starting frequency (at time    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   ), and   k   k   k   is the rate of frequency increase or chirp rate .      k  =     f  1   -   f  0    T       k       subscript  f  1    subscript  f  0    T     k=\frac{f_{1}-f_{0}}{T}     where    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   is the final frequency and    f  0     subscript  f  0    f_{0}   is the starting frequency.   T   T   T   is the time it takes to sweep from    f  0     subscript  f  0    f_{0}   to    f  1     subscript  f  1    f_{1}   .  The corresponding time-domain function for the phase of any oscillating signal is the integral of the frequency function, since one expects the phase to grow like     ϕ   (   t  +   Δ  t    )    ≃    ϕ   (  t  )    +   2  π  f   (  t  )   Δ  t       similar-to-or-equals    ϕ    t    normal-Δ  t         ϕ  t     2  π  f  t  normal-Δ  t      \phi(t+\Delta t)\simeq\phi(t)+2\pi f(t)\,\Delta t   , i.e., that the derivative of the phase is the angular frequency      ϕ  ′    (  t  )    =   2   π   f   (  t  )           superscript  ϕ  normal-′   t     2  π  f  t     \phi^{\prime}(t)=2\pi\,f(t)   .  For the linear chirp, this results in:      ϕ   (  t  )       ϕ  t    \displaystyle\phi(t)     where    ϕ  0     subscript  ϕ  0    \phi_{0}   is the initial phase (at time    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   ). Thus this is also called quadratic-phase signal . 2  The corresponding time-domain function for a sinusoidal linear chirp is the sine of the phase in radians:       x   (  t  )    =   sin   [    ϕ  0   +   2  π   (     f  0   t   +    k  2    t  2     )     ]          x  t        subscript  ϕ  0     2  π       subscript  f  0   t       k  2    superscript  t  2          x(t)=\sin\left[\phi_{0}+2\pi\left(f_{0}t+\frac{k}{2}t^{2}\right)\right]     In the frequency domain, the instantaneous frequency described by the equation     f   (  t  )    =    f  0   +   k  t          f  t      subscript  f  0     k  t      f(t)=f_{0}+kt   is accompanied by additional frequencies ( harmonics ) which exist as a fundamental consequence of frequency modulation . These harmonics are quantifiably described through the use of Bessel functions . However, with the aid of a frequency vs. time profile  spectrogram one can readily see that the linear chirp has spectral components at harmonics of the fundamental chirp.  Exponential chirp    In a geometric chirp , also called an exponential chirp , the frequency of the signal varies with a geometric relationship over time. In other words, if two points in the waveform are chosen,    t  1     subscript  t  1    t_{1}   and    t  2     subscript  t  2    t_{2}   , and the time interval between them     t  2   -   t  1        subscript  t  2    subscript  t  1     t_{2}-t_{1}   is kept constant, the frequency ratio      f   (   t  2   )    /  f    (   t  1   )           f   subscript  t  2    f    subscript  t  1     f(t_{2})/f(t_{1})   will also be constant.  In an exponential chirp, the frequency of the signal varies exponentially as a function of time:       f   (  t  )    =    f  0    k  t          f  t      subscript  f  0    superscript  k  t      f(t)=f_{0}k^{t}     where    f  0     subscript  f  0    f_{0}   is the starting frequency (at    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   ), and   k   k   k   is the rate of exponential increase in frequency. Unlike the linear chirp, which has a constant chirp rate, an exponential chirp has an exponentially increasing chirp rate.  The corresponding time-domain function for the phase of an exponential chirp is the integral of the frequency:      ϕ   (  t  )       ϕ  t    \displaystyle\phi(t)     Where    ϕ  0     subscript  ϕ  0    \phi_{0}   is the initial phase (at    t  =  0      t  0    t=0   ).  The corresponding time-domain function for a sinusoidal exponential chirp is the sine of the phase in radians:       x   (  t  )    =   sin   [    ϕ  0   +   2  π   f  0    (     k  t   -  1    ln   (  k  )     )     ]          x  t        subscript  ϕ  0     2  π   subscript  f  0        superscript  k  t   1     k         x(t)=\sin\left[\phi_{0}+2\pi f_{0}\left(\frac{k^{t}-1}{\ln(k)}\right)\right]     As was the case for the Linear Chirp, the instantaneous frequency of the Exponential Chirp consists of the fundamental frequency     f   (  t  )    =    f  0    k  t          f  t      subscript  f  0    superscript  k  t      f(t)=f_{0}k^{t}   accompanied by additional harmonics .  Generation of a chirp signal  A chirp signal can be generated with analog circuitry via a VCO , and a linearly or exponentially ramping control voltage . It can also be generated digitally by a DSP and DAC , using a Direct digital synthesizer (DDS) and by varying the step in the numerically controlled oscillator. It can also be generated by a YIG oscillator.  Relation to an impulse signal  A chirp signal shares the same spectral content with an impulse signal . However, unlike in the impulse signal, spectral components of the chirp signal have different phases, 3 4 5 i.e., their power spectra are alike but the phase spectra are distinct. Dispersion of a signal propagation medium may result in unintentional conversion of impulse signals into chirps. On the other hand, many practical applications, such as chirped pulse amplifiers or echolocation systems, 6 use chirp signals instead of impulses because of their inherently lower PAPR .  Uses and occurrences  Chirp modulation  Chirp modulation, or linear frequency modulation for digital communication was patented by Sidney Darlington in 1954 with significant later work performed by Winkler in 1962. This type of modulation employs sinusoidal waveforms whose instantaneous frequency increases or decreases linearly over time. These waveforms are commonly referred to as linear chirps or simply chirps.  Hence the rate at which their frequency changes is called the chirp rate . In binary chirp modulation, binary data is transmitted by mapping the bits into chirps of opposite chirp rates. For instance, over one bit period "1" is assigned a chirp with positive rate a and "0" a chirp with negative rate −a . Chirps have been heavily used in radar applications and as a result advanced sources for transmission and matched filters for reception of linear chirps are available.  (Figure)  (a) In image processing, direct periodicity seldom occurs, but, rather, periodicity-in-perspective is encountered. (b) Repeating structures like the alternating dark space inside the windows, and light space of the white concrete, "chirp" (increase in frequency) towards the right. (c) Thus the best fit chirp for image processing is often a projective chirp.   Chirplet transform  Another kind of chirp is the projective chirp, of the form:      g  =   f   [     a  ⋅  x   +  b     c  ⋅  x   +  1    ]        g    f   delimited-[]       normal-⋅  a  x   b      normal-⋅  c  x   1        g=f\left[\frac{a\cdot x+b}{c\cdot x+1}\right]   ,  having the three parameters a (scale), b (translation), and c (chirpiness). The projective chirp is ideally suited to image processing , and forms the basis for the projective chirplet transform .

Chirp rate  Chirp rate is the instantaneous rate of change of the frequency of a waveform. If a waveform is defined as:       x   (  t  )    =   sin   (   ϕ   (  t  )    )          x  t       ϕ  t      x(t)=\sin\left(\phi(t)\right)   then the instantaneous frequency is defined to be:       f   (  t  )    =    1   2  π      d  ϕ   (  t  )     d  t           f  t       1    2  π        d  ϕ  t     d  t       f(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d\phi(t)}{dt}   and the chirp rate is defined to be:       c   (  t  )    =    1   2  π       d  2   ϕ   (  t  )     d   t  2            c  t       1    2  π         superscript  d  2   ϕ  t     d   superscript  t  2        c(t)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\frac{d^{2}\phi(t)}{dt^{2}}     See also   Chirp spectrum - Analysis of the frequency spectrum of chirp signals  Chirp compression - Further information on compression techniques  Chirp Spread Spectrum - A part of the wireless telecommunications standard IEEE 802.15.4a CSS (see Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) PHY Presentation for IEEE P802.15.4a ).
