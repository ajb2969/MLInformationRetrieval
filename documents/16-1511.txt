Wiener–Lévy theorem

Wiener–Lévy theorem is a theorem in Fourier analysis, which states that a function of an absolutely convergent Fourier series has an absolutely convergent Fourier series under some conditions. The theorem was named after Norbert Wiener and Paul Lévy.
Norbert Wiener first proved Wiener's 1/f theorem,1 see Wiener's theorem. It states that if 
 
 
 
  has absolutely convergent Fourier series and is never zero, then its inverse 
 
 
 
  also has an absolutely convergent Fourier series.
Wiener–Levy theorem
Paul Levy generalized Wiener's result,2 showing that
Let 
 
 
 
  be a absolutely convergent Fourier series with


 
 . The values of 
 
 
 
  lie on a curve 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is an analytic (not necessarily single-valued) function of a complex variable which is regular at every point of 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  has an absolutely convergent Fourier series.
The proof can be found in the Zygmund's classic trigonometric series book.3
Example
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is characteristic function of discrete probability distribution. So 
 
 
 
  is an absolutely convergent Fourier series. If 
 
 
 
  has no zeros, then we have


 
 , where 
 
 
 
 .
The statistical application of this example can be found in discrete pseudo compound Poisson distribution and Zero-inflated model.
