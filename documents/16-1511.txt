   Wiener–Lévy theorem      Wiener–Lévy theorem   Wiener–Lévy theorem is a theorem in Fourier analysis , which states that a function of an absolutely convergent Fourier series has an absolutely convergent Fourier series under some conditions. The theorem was named after Norbert Wiener and Paul Lévy .  Norbert Wiener first proved Wiener's 1/ f theorem, 1 see Wiener's theorem . It states that if   f   f   f   has absolutely convergent Fourier series and is never zero, then its inverse    1  /  f      1  f    1/f   also has an absolutely convergent Fourier series.  Wiener–Levy theorem  Paul Levy generalized Wiener's result, 2 showing that  Let      F   (  θ  )    =    ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞     c  k    e   i  k  θ       ,   θ  ∈   [  0  ,   2  π   ]       formulae-sequence      F  θ     superscript   subscript     k             subscript  c  k    superscript  e    i  k  θ         θ   0    2  π       F(\theta)=\sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{{c_{k}}{e^{ik\theta}}},\theta\in[0,%
 2\pi]   be a absolutely convergent Fourier series with       ∥  F  ∥   =    ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞    |   c  k   |    <  ∞         norm  F     superscript   subscript     k             subscript  c  k              \left\|F\right\|=\sum\limits_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{\left|{{c_{k}}}\right|}<\infty   . The values of    F   (  θ  )       F  θ    F(\theta)   lie on a curve   C   C   C   , and    H   (  t  )       H  t    H(t)   is an analytic (not necessarily single-valued) function of a complex variable which is regular at every point of   C   C   C   . Then    H   [   F   (  θ  )    ]       H   delimited-[]    F  θ      H[F(\theta)]   has an absolutely convergent Fourier series.  The proof can be found in the Zygmund's classic trigonometric series book. 3  Example  Let     H   (  θ  )    =   l  n   (  θ  )          H  θ     l  n  θ     H(\theta)=ln(\theta)   and    F   (  θ  )   =   ∑   k  =  0   ∞    p  k    e   i  k  θ    ,   (   ∑   k  =  0   ∞    p  k   =  1  )      fragments  F   fragments  normal-(  θ  normal-)     superscript   subscript     k  0       subscript  p  k    superscript  e    i  k  θ    normal-,   fragments  normal-(   superscript   subscript     k  0       subscript  p  k    1  normal-)     F(\theta)=\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}{{p_{k}}{e^{ik\theta}}},(\sum\limits_{k=0}%
 ^{\infty}{{p_{k}}=1})   is characteristic function of discrete probability distribution. So    F   (  θ  )       F  θ    F(\theta)   is an absolutely convergent Fourier series. If    F   (  θ  )       F  θ    F(\theta)   has no zeros, then we have       H   [   F   (  θ  )    ]    =   l  n   (    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     p  k    e   i  k  θ      )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     c  k    e   i  k  θ              H   delimited-[]    F  θ       l  n    superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  p  k    superscript  e    i  k  θ              superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  c  k    superscript  e    i  k  θ         H[F(\theta)]=ln(\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}{{p_{k}}{e^{ik\theta}}})=\sum\limits%
 _{k=0}^{\infty}{{c_{k}}{e^{ik\theta}}}   , where     ∥  H  ∥   =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞    |   c  k   |    <  ∞         norm  H     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  c  k              \left\|H\right\|=\sum\limits_{k=0}^{\infty}{\left|{{c_{k}}}\right|}<\infty   .  The statistical application of this example can be found in discrete pseudo compound Poisson distribution and Zero-inflated model .
