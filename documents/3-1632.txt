Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius

Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius (1883–1970) was a German fluid dynamics physicist.
He was one of the first students of Prandtl who provided a mathematical basis for boundary-layer drag but also showed as early as 1911 that the resistance to flow through smooth pipes could be expressed in terms of the Reynolds number for both laminar and turbulent flow. After six years in science he changed to Ingenieurschule Hamburg (today: University of Applied Sciences Hamburg) and became a Professor. On 1 April 1962 Heinrich Blasius celebrated his 50th anniversary and was active in teaching until he died on 24 April 1970.
One of his most notable contributions involves a description of the steady two-dimensional boundary-layer that forms on a semi-infinite plate that is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow 
 
 
 
 .
Blasius' theorem
For a steady fluid flow with complex potential 
 
 
 
  around a fixed body enclosed by a contour 
 
 
 
 , the net force on the body due to fluid motion is given by 1



where 
 
 
 
  is the constant fluid density. This is a contour integral which may be computed by using Cauchy's residue theorem.
