   Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius      Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius   Paul Richard Heinrich Blasius (1883–1970) was a German  fluid dynamics  physicist .  He was one of the first students of Prandtl who provided a mathematical basis for boundary-layer drag but also showed as early as 1911 that the resistance to flow through smooth pipes could be expressed in terms of the Reynolds number for both laminar and turbulent flow. After six years in science he changed to Ingenieurschule Hamburg (today: University of Applied Sciences Hamburg) and became a Professor. On 1 April 1962 Heinrich Blasius celebrated his 50th anniversary and was active in teaching until he died on 24 April 1970.  One of his most notable contributions involves a description of the steady two-dimensional boundary-layer that forms on a semi-infinite plate that is held parallel to a constant unidirectional flow   U   U   U   .  Blasius' theorem  For a steady fluid flow with complex potential    w   (  z  )       w  z    w(z)   around a fixed body enclosed by a contour   C   C   C   , the net force on the body due to fluid motion is given by 1        F  x   -   i   F  y     =     i  ρ   2     ∮  C       (    d  w    d  z    )   2    d  z            subscript  F  x     i   subscript  F  y           i  ρ   2     subscript  contour-integral  C      superscript      normal-d  w     normal-d  z    2   normal-d  z       F_{x}-iF_{y}=\frac{i\rho}{2}\oint_{C}\left(\frac{\mathrm{d}w}{\mathrm{d}z}%
 \right)^{2}\,\mathrm{d}z     where   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the constant fluid density. This is a contour integral which may be computed by using Cauchy's residue theorem .
