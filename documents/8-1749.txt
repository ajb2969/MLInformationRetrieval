Cylindric algebra

The notion of cylindric algebra, invented by Alfred Tarski, arises naturally in the algebraization of first-order logic with equality. This is comparable to the role Boolean algebras play for propositional logic. Indeed, cylindric algebras are Boolean algebras equipped with additional cylindrification operations that model quantification and equality. They differ from polyadic algebras in that the latter do not model equality.
Definition of a cylindric algebra
A cylindric algebra of dimension

 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is any ordinal number) is an algebraic structure 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a Boolean algebra, 
 
 
 
  a unary operator on 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  a distinguished element of 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , such that the following hold:
(C1) 
 
 

(C2) 
 
 

(C3) 
 
 

(C4) 
 
 

(C5) 
 
 

(C6) If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 

(C7) If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 

Assuming a presentation of first-order logic without function symbols, the operator 
 
 
 
  models existential quantification over variable 
 
 
 
  in formula 
 
 
 
  while the operator 
 
 
 
  models the equality of variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Henceforth, reformulated using standard logical notations, the axioms read as
(C1) 
 
 

(C2) 
 
 

(C3) 
 
 

(C4) 
 
 

(C5) 
 
 

(C6) If 
 
 
 
  is a variable different from both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 

(C7) If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are different variables, then 
 
 

Generalizations
Recently, cylindric algebras have been generalized to the many-sorted case, which allows for a better modeling of the duality between first-order formulas and terms.
