3-oxolaurate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a 3-oxolaurate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-oxododecanoate 
 
 
 
  2-undecanone + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-oxododecanoate, and two products, 2-undecanone and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxododecanoate carboxy-lyase (2-undecanone-forming). Other names in common use include beta-ketolaurate decarboxylase, beta-ketoacyl decarboxylase, and 3-oxododecanoate carboxy-lyase.
