   Landau's problems      Landau's problems   At the 1912 International Congress of Mathematicians , Edmund Landau listed four basic problems about primes . These problems were characterised in his speech as "unattackable at the present state of science" and are now known as Landau's problems . They are as follows:   Goldbach's conjecture : Can every even integer greater than 2 be written as the sum of two primes?  Twin prime conjecture : Are there infinitely many primes p such that p + 2 is prime?  Legendre's conjecture : Does there always exist at least one prime between consecutive perfect squares ?  Are there infinitely many primes p such that p − 1 is a perfect square? In other words: Are there infinitely many primes of the form n 2 + 1? .   , all four problems are unresolved.  Progress toward solutions  Goldbach's conjecture  Vinogradov's theorem proves Goldbach's weak conjecture for sufficiently large n . In 2013 Harald Helfgott proved the weak conjecture for all odd numbers greater than 5. 1 2 3  Chen's theorem proves that for all sufficiently large n ,     2  n   =   p  +  q         2  n     p  q     2n=p+q   where p is prime and q is either prime or semiprime . Montgomery and Vaughan showed that the exceptional set (even numbers not expressible as the sum of two primes) was of density zero. 4  Twin prime conjecture  Yitang Zhang 5 showed that there are infinitely many prime pairs with gap bounded by 70 million, and this result has been improved to gaps of length 246 by a collaborative effort. 6 Under the generalized Elliott–Halberstam conjecture this was improved to 6, extending earlier work by Maynard 7 and Goldston , Pintz & Yıldırım . 8  Chen showed that there are infinitely many primes p (later called Chen primes ) such that p +2 is either a prime or a semiprime.  Legendre's conjecture  It suffices to check that each prime gap starting at p is smaller than    2   p       2    p     2\sqrt{p}   . A table of maximal prime gaps shows that the conjecture holds to 4×10 18 . 9 A counterexample near 10 18 would require a prime gap fifty million times the size of the average gap. Matomäki shows that there are at most    x   1  /  6      superscript  x    1  6     x^{1/6}   exceptional primes followed by gaps larger than     2  p         2  p     \sqrt{2p}   ; in particular,          ∑    x  ≤   p  n   ≤   2  x       p   n  +  1    -   p  n    >   x   1  /  2        p   n  +  1     -   p  n    ≪   x   2  /  3     .     much-less-than      subscript    superscript      x   subscript  p  n          2  x          subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n     superscript  x    1  2        subscript  p    n  1      subscript  p  n     superscript  x    2  3      \sum_{\stackrel{p_{n+1}-p_{n}>x^{1/2}}{x\leq p_{n}\leq 2x}}p_{n+1}-p_{n}\ll x^%
 {2/3}.    10  A result due to Ingham shows that there is a prime between    n  3     superscript  n  3    n^{3}   and     (   n  +  1   )   3     superscript    n  1   3    (n+1)^{3}   for every large enough n . 11  Near-square primes  The Friedlander–Iwaniec theorem shows that infinitely many primes are of the form     x  2   +   y  4        superscript  x  2    superscript  y  4     x^{2}+y^{4}   .  Iwaniec showed that there are infinitely many numbers of the form     n  2   +  1       superscript  n  2   1    n^{2}+1   with at most two prime factors. 12 13  Notes  External links     "  Category:Conjectures about prime numbers  Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  Yitang Zhang, Bounded gaps between primes , Annals of Mathematics  179 (2014), pp. 1121–1174 from Volume 179 (2014), Issue 3 ↩  D.
