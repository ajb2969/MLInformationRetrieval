Biotin carboxylase

In enzymology, a biotin carboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein + CO2

 
  ADP + phosphate + carboxybiotin-carboxyl-carrier protein
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, biotin-carboxyl-carrier protein, and CO2, whereas its 3 products are ADP, phosphate, and carboxybiotin-carboxyl-carrier protein.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is biotin-carboxyl-carrier-protein:carbon-dioxide ligase (ADP-forming). This enzyme is also called biotin carboxylase (component of acetyl CoA carboxylase). This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis.
A C-terminal conserved domain within this enzyme contains most of the active site residues.1
