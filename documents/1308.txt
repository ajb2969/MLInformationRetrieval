   Mycothiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase      Mycothiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a mycothiol-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   formaldehyde + mycothiol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-formylmycothiol + NADH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are formaldehyde , mycothiol , and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are S-formylmycothiol , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formaldehyde:NAD+ oxidoreductase (mycothiol-formylating) . This enzyme is also called NAD/factor-dependent formaldehyde dehydrogenase .
