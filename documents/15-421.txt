G-expectation

In probability theory, the g-expectation is a nonlinear expectation based on a backwards stochastic differential equation (BSDE) originally developed by Shige Peng.1
Definition
Given a probability space 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  is a (d-dimensional) Wiener process (on that space). Given the filtration generated by 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
measurable. Consider the BSDE given by:


 
 
  Then the g-expectation for 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 
 . Note that if 
 
 
 
  is an m-dimensional vector, then 
 
 
 
  (for each time 
 
 
 
 ) is an m-dimensional vector and 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 
  matrix.
In fact the conditional expectation is given by 
 
 
 
  and much like the formal definition for conditional expectation it follows that 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
  (and the 
 
 
 
  function is the indicator function).2
Existence and uniqueness
Let 
 
 
 
 
  satisfy:



 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -adapted process for every 
 
 



 
  the L2 space (where 
 
 
 
 
  is a norm in 
 
 
 
 )


 
  is Lipschitz continuous in 
 
 
 
 , i.e. for every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  it follows that 
 
 
 
  for some constant 
 
 


Then for any random variable 
 
 
 
  there exists a unique pair of 
 
 
 
 -adapted processes 
 
 
 
 
  which satisfy the stochastic differential equation.3
In particular, if 
 
 
 
  additionally satisfies:



 
  is continuous in time (
 
 
 
 )


 
  for all 
 
 


then for the terminal random variable 
 
 
 
  it follows that the solution processes 
 
 
 
  are square integrable. Therefore 
 
 
 
  is square integrable for all times 
 
 
 
 .4
