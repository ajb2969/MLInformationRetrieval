   Retinal oxidase      Retinal oxidase   In enzymology , a retinal oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   retinal + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   retinoic acid + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are retinal , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are retinoic acid and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is retinal:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called retinene oxidase . This enzyme participates in retinol metabolism .
