   Venoyl-CoA hydratase 2      Venoyl-CoA hydratase 2   Enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 (, 2-enoyl-CoA hydratase 2 , AtECH2 , ECH2 , MaoC , MFE-2 , PhaJAc , D-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase , D-specific 2-trans-enoyl-CoA hydratase ) is an enzyme with system name (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA hydro-lyase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (3R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (2E)-2-enoyl-CoA + H 2 O   This enzyme catalyses a hydration step in peroxisomal beta-oxidation.
