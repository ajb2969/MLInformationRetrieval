   Gallery of named graphs      Gallery of named graphs   Some of the finite structures considered in graph theory have names, sometimes inspired by the graph's topology, and sometimes after their discoverer. A famous example is the Petersen graph , a concrete graph on 10 vertices that appears as a minimal example or counterexample in many different contexts.

Fullerene graphs  In graph theory, the term fullerene refers to any 3- regular , planar graph with all faces of size 5 or 6 (including the external face). It follows from Euler's polyhedron formula , V – E + F = 2 (where V , E , F indicate the number of vertices, edges, and faces), that there are exactly 12 pentagons in a fullerene and V /2–10 hexagons. Fullerene graphs are the Schlegel representations of the corresponding fullerene compounds.

Brinkmann and A. Dress. 3 G. Brinkmann also provided a freely available implementation, called fullgen .  Platonic solids  The complete graph on four vertices forms the skeleton of the tetrahedron , and more generally the complete graphs form skeletons of simplices . The hypercube graphs are also skeletons of higher-dimensional regular polytopes .
