   Cousin's theorem      Cousin's theorem   In real analysis , a branch of mathematics, Cousin's theorem states that:   If for every point of a closed region (in modern terms, " closed and bounded ") there is a circle of finite radius (in modern term, a " neighborhood ") , then the region can be divided into a finite number of subregions such that each subregion is interior to a circle of a given set having its center in the subregion. 1    This result was proved and established by Pierre Cousin, a student of Henri Poincaré , in 1895, and it is an extension of the original Heine–Borel theorem on compactness for arbitrary covers of any compact subsets of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . However, Pierre Cousin did not receive any credit. Cousin's theorem was generally attributed to Henri Lebesgue and renamed as Borel–Lebesgue theorem , who was aware of this result in 1898 and proved this in his dissertation in 1903. 2  Nowadays, it is stated as:   Let   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   be a full cover of [ a , b ], that is, a collection of closed subintervals of [ a , b ] with the property that for every x ∈[ a , b ], there exists a δ >0 so that   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   contains all subintervals of [ a , b ] which contains x and length smaller than δ . Then there exists a partition { I 1 , I 2 ,..., I n } of non-overlapping intervals for [ a , b ], where I i =[ x i-1 , x i ]∈   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   and a=x 0 1 <... x="">n=b ... for all 1≤i≤n .   Further, Cousin's theorem is mainly only used in Henstock–Kurzweil integral and is often called Fineness Theorem or Cousin's lemma. It can be stated as:   If I := [ a , b ] ⊆ R n is a nondegenerate  compact interval and δ is any gauge defined on I , then there always exists a tagged partition of I that is δ -fine. 3    Notes  References   Hildebrandt, T.
