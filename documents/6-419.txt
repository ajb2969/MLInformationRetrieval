   Generalized arithmetic progression      Generalized arithmetic progression   In mathematics , a multiple arithmetic progression , generalized arithmetic progression , k - dimensional arithmetic progression or a linear set , is a set of integers or tuples of integers constructed as an arithmetic progression is, but allowing several possible differences. So, for example, we start at 17 and may add a multiple of 3 or of 5, repeatedly. In algebraic terms we look at integers      a  +   m  b   +   n  c   +  …      a    m  b     n  c   normal-…    a+mb+nc+\ldots     where    a  ,  b  ,  c     a  b  c    a,b,c   and so on are fixed, and    m  ,  n     m  n    m,n   and so on are confined to some ranges     0   0     ≤    m   m   m    ≤    M   M   M     and so on, for a finite progression. The number   k   k   k   , that is the number of permissible differences, is called the dimension of the generalized progression.  More generally, let      L   (  C  ;  P  )       L   C  P     L(C;P)     be the set of all elements   x   x   x   in    N  n     superscript  N  n    N^{n}   of the form       x  =    c  0   +    ∑   i  =  1   m     k  i    x  i       ,      x     subscript  c  0     superscript   subscript     i  1    m      subscript  k  i    subscript  x  i        x=c_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{m}k_{i}x_{i},     with    c  0     subscript  c  0    c_{0}   in   C   C   C   ,     x  1   ,  …  ,   x  m       subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  m     x_{1},\ldots,x_{m}   in   P   P   P   , and     k  1   ,  …  ,   k  m       subscript  k  1   normal-…   subscript  k  m     k_{1},\ldots,k_{m}   in   N   N   N   .   L   L   L   is said to be a linear set if   C   C   C   consists of exactly one element, and   P   P   P   is finite.  A subset of    N  n     superscript  N  n    N^{n}   is said to be semilinear if it is a finite union of linear sets.
