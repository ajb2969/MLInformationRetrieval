Generalized arithmetic progression

In mathematics, a multiple arithmetic progression, generalized arithmetic progression, k-dimensional arithmetic progression or a linear set, is a set of integers or tuples of integers constructed as an arithmetic progression is, but allowing several possible differences. So, for example, we start at 17 and may add a multiple of 3 or of 5, repeatedly. In algebraic terms we look at integers



where 
 
 
 
  and so on are fixed, and 
 
 
 
  and so on are confined to some ranges


 ≤ 

 ≤ 


and so on, for a finite progression. The number  
 
 
 
 , that is the number of permissible differences, is called the dimension of the generalized progression.
More generally, let



be the set of all elements 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  of the form

  in

  is said to be a linear set if 
 
 
 
  consists of exactly one element, and 
 
 
 
  is finite.
A subset of
