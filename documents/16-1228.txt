   Multi-surface method      Multi-surface method   The multi-surface method (MSM) is a form of decision making using the concept of piecewise-linear separability of datasets to categorize data.  Introduction  Two datasets are linearly separable if their convex hulls do not intersect. The method may be formulated as a feedforward neural network with weights that are trained via linear programming . Comparisons between neural networks trained with the MSM versus backpropagation show MSM is better able to classify data. 1 The decision problem associated linear program for the MSM is NP-Complete .  Mathematical Formulation  Given two finite disjoint point sets     𝒜  ,  ℬ   ∈   ℝ  n        𝒜  ℬ    superscript  ℝ  n     \mathcal{A,B}\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   , find a discriminant,    f  :    ℝ  n   →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n   ℝ     f:\mathbb{R}^{n}\to\mathbb{R}   such that      f   (  𝒜  )    >  0   ,    f   (  ℬ  )    ≤  0      formulae-sequence      f  𝒜   0       f  ℬ   0     f(\mathcal{A})>0,f(\mathcal{B})\leq 0   . If the intersection of convex hulls of the two sets is the empty set, then it is possible to use a single linear program to obtain a linear discriminant of the form,     f   (  x  )    =    c  x   +  γ         f  x       c  x   γ     f(x)=cx+\gamma   . Usually, in real applications, the sets' convex hulls do intersect, and a (often non-convex) piecewise-linear discriminant can be used, through the use of several linear programs. 2  See also   Backpropagation  Linear Programming   References  "  Category:Neural networks     Neural Network Training via Linear Programing , Advances in Optimization and Parallel Computing, 1992, p. 56 ↩  "Pattern Recognition via Linear Programming: Theory and Application to Medical Diagnosis", O.
