   Aspartate—tRNA(Asn) ligase      Aspartate—tRNA(Asn) ligase   In enzymology , an asparagine-tRNAAsn ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-asparagine + tRNAAsx   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + asparaginyl-tRNAAsx   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-asparagine , and tRNAAsx , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and asparaginyl-tRNAAsx .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-asparaginyl:tRNAAsx ligase (AMP-forming) . This enzyme is also called nondiscriminating asparaginyl-tRNA synthetase . This enzyme participates in alanine and asparagine metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 6.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
