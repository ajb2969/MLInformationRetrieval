   Basic pitch count estimator      Basic pitch count estimator   In baseball statistics , the Basic Pitch Count Estimator is a statistic used to try to estimate the number of pitches thrown by a pitcher where there is no pitch count data available. The formula was first derived by Tom M. Tango . The formula is     3.3  P  A   +   1.5  S  O   +   2.2  B  B         3.3  P  A     1.5  S  O     2.2  B  B     3.3PA+1.5SO+2.2BB    1 , where PA is equivalent to the number of plate appearances against the pitcher, SO is equal to strikeouts thrown (Ks), and BB is the number of walks thrown (BB, or bases on balls).  Since 2007 the formula has been updated by Brian Yonushonis. This newer formula that he uses is E(Pitches)=3.29*PA+1.92*K+2.04*RBB-1.05*IBB-0.2*HA+PA*(0.755-PIP%)  Ex from 2014 for Top 5 pitchers Player, Actual, Estimated Price, 3730, 3874 Cueto, 3659, 3726 Scherzer, 3638, 3552 Shields, 3632, 3480 Dickey, 3513, 3452  See also   Pitch count  Batters Faced by Pitcher   "  Category:Pitching statistics
