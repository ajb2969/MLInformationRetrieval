   Molien series      Molien series   In mathematics , a Molien series is a generating function attached to a linear representation ρ of a group  G on a finite-dimensional vector space  V . It counts the homogeneous polynomials of a given total degree  d that are invariants for G . It is named for Theodor Molien .  Formulation  More formally, there is a vector space of such polynomials, for each given value of d = 0, 1, 2, ..., and we write n d for its vector space dimension , or in other words the number of linearly independent homogeneous invariants of a given degree. In more algebraic terms, take the d -th symmetric power of V , and the representation of G on it arising from ρ. The invariants form the subspace consisting of all vectors fixed by all elements of G , and n d is its dimension.  The Molien series is then by definition the formal power series        M   (  t  )    =    ∑  d     n  d    t  d      .        M  t     subscript   d      subscript  n  d    superscript  t  d       M(t)=\sum_{d}n_{d}t^{d}.     This can be looked at another way, by considering the representation of G on the symmetric algebra of V , and then the whole subalgebra  R of G -invariants. Then n d is the dimension of the homogeneous part of R of dimension d , when we look at it as graded ring . In this way a Molien series is also a kind of Hilbert function . Without further hypotheses not a great deal can be said, but assuming some conditions of finiteness it is then possible to show that the Molien series is a rational function . The case of finite groups is most often studied.  Formula  Molien showed that       M   (  t  )    =    1   |  G  |      ∑   g  ∈  G     1   det   (   I  -   t  g    )             M  t       1    G      subscript     g  G      1      I    t  g          M(t)=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\frac{1}{\det(I-tg)}     This means that the coefficient of t d in this series is the dimension n d defined above. It assumes that the characteristic of the field does not divide | G | (but even without this assumption, Molien's formula in the form       |  G  |   ⋅  M    (  t  )    =    ∑   g  ∈  G     1   det   (   I  -   t  g    )             normal-⋅    G   M   t     subscript     g  G      1      I    t  g         |G|\cdot M(t)=\sum_{g\in G}\frac{1}{\det(I-tg)}   is valid, although it does not help with computing M ( t )).  Example  Consider    S  3     subscript  S  3    S_{3}   acting on R 3 by permuting the coordinates. Note that    det   (   I  -   t  g    )         I    t  g      \det(I-tg)   is constant on conjugacy classes, so it is enough to take one from each of the three classes in    S  3     subscript  S  3    S_{3}   ; so      det   (   I  -   t  e    )    =    (   1  -  t   )   3    ,    det   (   I  -   t   σ  2     )    =    (   1  -  t   )    (   1  -   t  2    )        formulae-sequence        I    t  e      superscript    1  t   3          I    t   subscript  σ  2          1  t     1   superscript  t  2        \det(I-te)=(1-t)^{3},\det(I-t\sigma_{2})=(1-t)(1-t^{2})   and     det   (   1  -   t   σ  3     )    =   (   1  -   t  3    )           1    t   subscript  σ  3        1   superscript  t  3      \det(1-t\sigma_{3})=(1-t^{3})   where     σ  2   =   (  1  ,  2  )        subscript  σ  2    1  2     \sigma_{2}=(1,2)   and     σ  3   =   (  1  ,  2  ,  3  )        subscript  σ  3    1  2  3     \sigma_{3}=(1,2,3)   .  Then       M   (  t  )    =    1  6    (    1    (   1  -  t   )   3    +   3    (   1  -  t   )    (   1  -   t  2    )     +   2   1  -   t  3      )    =   1    (   1  -  t   )    (   1  -   t  2    )    (   1  -   t  3    )             M  t       1  6       1   superscript    1  t   3      3      1  t     1   superscript  t  2        2    1   superscript  t  3              1      1  t     1   superscript  t  2      1   superscript  t  3         M(t)=\frac{1}{6}\left(\frac{1}{(1-t)^{3}}+\frac{3}{(1-t)(1-t^{2})}+\frac{2}{1-%
 t^{3}}\right)=\frac{1}{(1-t)(1-t^{2})(1-t^{3})}     References   David A. Cox, John B. Little, Donal O'Shea (2005), Using Algebraic Geometry , pp. 295–8     "  Category:Invariant theory  Category:Representation theory of groups
