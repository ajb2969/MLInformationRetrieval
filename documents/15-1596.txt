   D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose-7-phosphate kinase      D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose-7-phosphate kinase   D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose-7-phosphate kinase (, D-alpha-D-heptose-7-phosphate kinase , hdda (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name ATP:D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose 7-phosphate + ATP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose 1,7-bisphosphate + ADP   The enzyme participates in biosynthesis of GDP-D-glycero-alpha-D-manno-heptose.
