Tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase




Tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase

In enzymology, a tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

dimethylallyl diphosphate + L-tryptophan 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + 4-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-L-tryptophan
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dimethylallyl diphosphate and L-tryptophan, whereas its two products are diphosphate and 4-(3-methylbut-2-enyl)-L-tryptophan.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dimethylallyl-diphosphate:L-tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase. Other names in common use include dimethylallylpyrophosphate:L-tryptophan dimethylallyltransferase, dimethylallyltryptophan synthetase, dimethylallylpyrophosphate:tryptophan dimethylallyl transferase, DMAT synthetase, and 4-(gamma,gamma-dimethylallyl)tryptophan synthase.
