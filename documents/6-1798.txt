   Acnode      Acnode   (Figure)  An acnode at the origin (curve described in text)   An acnode is an isolated point not on a curve , but whose coordinates satisfy the equation of the curve. The term " isolated point or hermit point " is an equivalent term. 1  Acnodes are commonly found in the study of algebraic curves over fields which are not algebraically closed , defined as the zero set of a polynomial of two variables. For example the equation       f   (  x  ,  y  )    =     y  2   +   x  2    -   x  3    =   0           f   x  y         superscript  y  2    superscript  x  2     superscript  x  3         0     f(x,y)=y^{2}+x^{2}-x^{3}=0\;   has an acnode at the origin of    ℝ  2     superscript  ℝ  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   , because it is equivalent to       y  2   =    x  2    (   x  -  1   )         superscript  y  2      superscript  x  2     x  1      y^{2}=x^{2}(x-1)   and     x  2    (   x  -  1   )        superscript  x  2     x  1     x^{2}(x-1)   is non-negative when   x   x   x   ≥ 1 and when    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   . Thus, over the real numbers the equation has no solutions for    x  <  1      x  1    x<1   except for (0, 0).  In contrast, over the complex numbers the origin is not isolated since square roots of negative real numbers exist.  An acnode is a singularity of the function, where both partial derivatives     ∂  f    ∂  x         f     x     \partial f\over\partial x   and     ∂  f    ∂  y         f     y     \partial f\over\partial y   vanish. Further the Hessian matrix of second derivatives will be positive definite or negative definite . Hence the function has a local minimum or a local maximum.
