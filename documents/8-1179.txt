Formation matrix

In statistics and information theory, the expected formation matrix of a likelihood function

 
  is the matrix inverse of the Fisher information matrix of 
 
 
 
 , while the observed formation matrix of 
 
 
 
  is the inverse of the observed information matrix of 
 
 
 
 .1
Currently, no notation for dealing with formation matrices is widely used, but in books and articles by Ole E. Barndorff-Nielsen and Peter McCullagh, the symbol 
 
 
 
  is used to denote the element of the i-th line and j-th column of the observed formation matrix. The geometric interpretation of the Fisher information matrix (metric) leads to a notation of 
 
 
 
  following the notation of the (contravariant) metric tensor in differential geometry. The Fisher information metric is denoted by 
 
 
 
  so that using Einstein notation we have 
 
 
 
 .
These matrices appear naturally in the asymptotic expansion of the distribution of many statistics related to the likelihood ratio.
