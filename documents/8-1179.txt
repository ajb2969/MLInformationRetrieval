   Formation matrix      Formation matrix   In statistics and information theory , the expected formation matrix of a likelihood function     L   (  θ  )       L  θ    L(\theta)   is the matrix inverse of the Fisher information matrix of    L   (  θ  )       L  θ    L(\theta)   , while the observed formation matrix of    L   (  θ  )       L  θ    L(\theta)   is the inverse of the observed information matrix of    L   (  θ  )       L  θ    L(\theta)   . 1  Currently, no notation for dealing with formation matrices is widely used, but in books and articles by Ole E. Barndorff-Nielsen and Peter McCullagh , the symbol    j   i  j      superscript  j    i  j     j^{ij}   is used to denote the element of the i-th line and j-th column of the observed formation matrix. The geometric interpretation of the Fisher information matrix (metric) leads to a notation of    g   i  j      superscript  g    i  j     g^{ij}   following the notation of the ( contravariant ) metric tensor in differential geometry . The Fisher information metric is denoted by    g   i  j      subscript  g    i  j     g_{ij}   so that using Einstein notation we have      g   i  k     g   k  j     =   δ  i  j          subscript  g    i  k     superscript  g    k  j      superscript   subscript  δ  i   j     g_{ik}g^{kj}=\delta_{i}^{j}   .  These matrices appear naturally in the asymptotic expansion of the distribution of many statistics related to the likelihood ratio .
