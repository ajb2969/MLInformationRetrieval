Elliptic cylindrical coordinates

(Figure)
Coordinate surfaces of elliptic cylindrical coordinates. The yellow sheet is the prism of a half-hyperbola corresponding to ν=-45°, whereas the red tube is an elliptical prism corresponding to μ=1. The blue sheet corresponds to z=1. The three surfaces intersect at the point P (shown as a black sphere) with Cartesian coordinates roughly (2.182, -1.661, 1.0). The foci of the ellipse and hyperbola lie at x = ±2.0.

Elliptic cylindrical coordinates are a three-dimensional orthogonal coordinate system that results from projecting the two-dimensional elliptic coordinate system in the perpendicular 
 
 
 
 -direction. Hence, the coordinate surfaces are prisms of confocal ellipses and hyperbolae. The two foci

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are generally taken to be fixed at 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, on the 
 
 
 
 -axis of the Cartesian coordinate system.
Basic definition
The most common definition of elliptic cylindrical coordinates 
 
 
 
  is









where 
 
 
 
  is a nonnegative real number and 
 
 
 
 .
These definitions correspond to ellipses and hyperbolae. The trigonometric identity



shows that curves of constant 
 
 
 
  form ellipses, whereas the hyperbolic trigonometric identity



shows that curves of constant 
 
 
 
  form hyperbolae.
Scale factors
The scale factors for the elliptic cylindrical coordinates 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are equal



whereas the remaining scale factor 
 
 
 
 . Consequently, an infinitesimal volume element equals



and the Laplacian equals



Other differential operators such as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in the coordinates 
 
 
 
  by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates.
Alternative definition
An alternative and geometrically intuitive set of elliptic coordinates 
 
 
 
  are sometimes used, where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Hence, the curves of constant 
 
 
 
  are ellipses, whereas the curves of constant 
 
 
 
  are hyperbolae. The coordinate 
 
 
 
  must belong to the interval [-1, 1], whereas the 
 
 
 
  coordinate must be greater than or equal to one.
The coordinates 
 
 
 
  have a simple relation to the distances to the foci 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . For any point in the (x,y) plane, the sum

 
  of its distances to the foci equals 
 
 
 
 , whereas their difference

 
  equals 
 
 
 
 . Thus, the distance to 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 , whereas the distance to 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . (Recall that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are located at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively.)
A drawback of these coordinates is that they do not have a 1-to-1 transformation to the Cartesian coordinates






Alternative scale factors
The scale factors for the alternative elliptic coordinates 
 
 
 
  are






and, of course, 
 
 
 
 . Hence, the infinitesimal volume element becomes



and the Laplacian equals



Other differential operators such as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be expressed in the coordinates 
 
 
 
  by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates.
Applications
The classic applications of elliptic cylindrical coordinates are in solving partial differential equations, e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation, for which elliptic cylindrical coordinates allow a separation of variables. A typical example would be the electric field surrounding a flat conducting plate of width 
 
 
 
 .
The three-dimensional wave equation, when expressed in elliptic cylindrical coordinates, may be solved by separation of variables, leading to the Mathieu differential equations.
The geometric properties of elliptic coordinates can also be useful. A typical example might involve an integration over all pairs of vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  that sum to a fixed vector 
 
 
 
 , where the integrand was a function of the vector lengths 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . (In such a case, one would position 
 
 
 
  between the two foci and aligned with the 
 
 
 
 -axis, i.e., 
 
 
 
 .) For concreteness, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  could represent the momenta of a particle and its decomposition products, respectively, and the integrand might involve the kinetic energies of the products (which are proportional to the squared lengths of the momenta).
