   Hydroxylamine reductase      Hydroxylamine reductase   In enzymology , a hydroxylamine reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NH 3 + H 2 O + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hydroxylamine + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NH 3 , H 2 O , and acceptor , whereas its two products are hydroxylamine and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on other nitrogenous compounds as donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ammonia:acceptor oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include hydroxylamine (acceptor) reductase , and ammonia:(acceptor) oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Flavoprotein .
