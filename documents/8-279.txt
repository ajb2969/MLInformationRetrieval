Voigt effect

thumb|right|upright=2.5|Schematic of the polar Kerr effect, longitudinal Kerr effect and the Voigt effect The Voigt effect is a magneto-optical phenomenon which rotates and elliptizes a linearly polarised light.1 Unlike many other magneto-optical effects such as the Kerr or Faraday effect which are linearly proportional to the magnetization (or to the applied magnetic field for a non magnetized material), the Voigt effect is proportional to the square of the magnetization (or square of the magnetic field) and can be seen experimentally at normal incidence. Commonly in literature, one can find several denomination for this effect such as Cotton-Moutton effect (in reference of french scientists Aimé Cotton and Henri Mouton), the Voigt effect (in reference of the German scientist Woldemar Voigt) or also as magnetic-linear birefringence. This last denomination is closer from the physical sense where the Voigt effect is a magnetic birefringence of the material with an indice of refraction parallel (
 
 
 
 ) and perpendicular 
 
 
 
 ) to the magnetization vector or to the applied magnetic field.2
For an electromagnetic wave with a linear incident polarisation 
 
 
 
  and a sample which exhibit an in-plane magnetized sample 
 
 
 
  , the expression of the rotation 
 
 
 
  is :

  the parameter responsible of the Voigt effect. Detailed calculation and an illustration are given in section below.

As the others magneto-optical effect, the theory is developped in a standard way with the utilisation of an effective dielectric tensor from which we calculate eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
Here, we consider an incident polarisation with 
 
 
 
  the electric field and a homogenously in-plane magnetized sample 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is referred from the [100] crystallographic direction. The aim is to calculate 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the rotation of polarization due to the coupling of the light with the magnetization. Let us notice that

Dielectric tensor
Following the notation of Hubert,3 the generalized dielectric cubic tensor 
 
 
 
  take the following form :



where 
 
 
 
  is the material dielectric constant, 
 
 
 
  the Voigt parameter, 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  two cubic constants describing magneto-optical effect depending of 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is the reduce 
 
 
 
 . Calculation is made in the spherical approximation with 
 
 
 
 
  . At the present moment, there is no evidence that this approximation is not valid, as the observation of Voigt effect is rare because extremely small with respect to the Kerr effect.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors
To calculate the eigenvalues and eigenvectors, we consider the propagation equation derived from the Maxwell equations, with the convention 
 
 
 
  . :



When the magnetization is perpendicular to the propagation wavevector, on the contrary of the Kerr effect, 
 
 
 
  may have all his three components equals to zero making calculations rather more complicated and Fresnels equations are no longer valid. A way to simplify the problem consist to use the electric field displacement vector 
 
 
 
  . Since 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
  . The inconvenient is to deal with the inverse dielectric tensor which may be complicated to handle.
Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are found by solving the propagation equation on 
 
 
 
  which gives the following system of equation :


 
  where 
 
 
 
  represent the inverse 
 
 
 
  element of the dielectric tensor 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . After a straightforward calculation of the system's determinant, one has to make a developpement on 2nd order in 
 
 
 
  and first order of 
 
 
 
 . This lead to the two eigenvalues corresponding the two refraction indices :




The corresponding eigenvectors for 
 
 
 
  and for 
 
 
 
  are :



Continuity relation
Knowing the eigenvectors and eigenvalues inside the material, one have to calculate 
 
 
 
  the reflected electromagnetic vector usually detected in experiments. We use the continuity equations for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the induction defined from Maxwell equation by 
 
 
 
 . Inside the medium, the electromagnetic field is decomposed on the derived eigenvectors 
 
 
 
 . The system of equation to solve is :



The solution of this system of equation are :




Calculation of rotation angle
The rotation angle 
 
 
 
  and the ellipticity angle 
 
 
 
  are defined from the ratio 
 
 
 
 
  with the two following formula :



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent the real and imaginary part of 
 
 
 
 . Using the two previously calculated component, one obtain :


 
 
 This gives for the Voigt rotation :

As an illustration of the application of Voigt effect, we give an example in the magnetic semiconductor (Ga,Mn)As were a giant Voigt effect was observed.4 At low temperature (without entering in detail, in general for 
 
 
 
 ) for a material with an in-plane magnetization, (Ga,Mn)As exhibit a biaxial anisotropy with the magnetization aligned along (or close to)  directions.
A typical hysteresis cycle containing the Voigt effect is shown in the figure (). This cycle was obtained by sending a linearly polarized light along the [110] direction with an incident angle of approximately 3°, and measuring the rotation due to magneto-optical effects of the reflected light beam. As one can see, on the contrary of common longitudinal/polar Kerr effect, the hysteresis cycle is even with respect to the magnetization which is a signature of the Voigt effect. Nevertheless this cycle was obtained with a light incidence very close to normal, it exhibits also a small odd part and a correct treatment has to be carried out in order to extract the symetric part of the hysteris corresponding to the Voigt effect, and the asymetric corresponding to the longitudinal Kerr effect.
In the case of the hysteresis presented here, the field was applied along the [1-10] direction. The switching mechanism is as follow :

We start with a high negative field and the magnetization is close to the [-1-10] direction at position 1.
The magnetic field is decreasing leading to a coherent magnetization rotation from 1 to 2
At positive field, the magnetization switch brutally from 2 to 3 by nucleation and propagation of magnetic domains giving a first coercive field named here 
 
 

The magnetization stay close to the state 3 while rotating coherently to the state 4, closer from the applied field direction.
Again the magnetization switches abruptly from 4 to 5 by nucleation and propagation of magnetic domains. This switching is due to the fact that the final equilibrium position is closer from the state 5 with respect to the state 4 (and so his magnetic energy is lower). This gives another coercive field named 
 
 

Finaly the magnetization rotates coherently from the state 5 to the state 6.

The simulation of this scenario is given in the figure b, with 
 
 
 
 
 . As one can see, the simulated hysteresis is qualitatively the same with respect to the experimental one. Nottice that the amplitude at 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  are approximately twice of
