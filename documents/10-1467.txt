   Enzyme-thiol transhydrogenase (glutathione-disulfide)      Enzyme-thiol transhydrogenase (glutathione-disulfide)   In enzymology , an enzyme-thiol transhydrogenase (glutathione-disulfide) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   [xanthine dehydrogenase] + glutathione disulfide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [xanthine oxidase] + 2 glutathione   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are xanthine dehydrogenase and glutathione disulfide , whereas its two products are xanthine oxidase and glutathione .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is [xanthine-dehydrogenase]:glutathione-disulfide S-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include [xanthine-dehydrogenase]:oxidized-glutathione S-oxidoreductase , enzyme-thiol transhydrogenase (oxidized-glutathione) , glutathione-dependent thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase , and thiol:disulfide oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in glutathione metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.8.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
