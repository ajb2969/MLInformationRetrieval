3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate aldolase

In enzymology, a 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + D-arabinose
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate, and two products, pyruvate and D-arabinose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate D-arabinose-lyase (pyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate aldolase, KDOaldolase, 3-deoxyoctulosonic aldolase, 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonic aldolase, 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonic aldolase, and 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate D-arabinose-lyase.
