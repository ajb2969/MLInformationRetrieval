   Pseudo algebraically closed field      Pseudo algebraically closed field   In mathematics , a field    K   K   K   is pseudo algebraically closed if it satisfies certain properties which hold for any algebraically closed field . The concept was introduced by James Ax in 1967. 1  Formulation  A field K is pseudo algebraically closed (usually abbreviated by PAC 2 ) if one of the following equivalent conditions holds:   Each absolutely irreducible variety   V   V   V   defined over   K   K   K   has a   K   K   K   - rational point .  For each absolutely irreducible polynomial    f  ‚àà   K   [   T  1   ,   T  2   ,  ‚ãØ  ,   T  r   ,  X  ]        f    K    subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2   normal-‚ãØ   subscript  T  r   X      f\in K[T_{1},T_{2},\cdots,T_{r},X]   with      ‚àÇ  f    ‚àÇ  X    ‚â†  0          f     X    0    \frac{\partial f}{\partial X}\not=0   and for each nonzero    g  ‚àà   K   [   T  1   ,   T  2   ,  ‚ãØ  ,   T  r   ]        g    K    subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2   normal-‚ãØ   subscript  T  r       g\in K[T_{1},T_{2},\cdots,T_{r}]   there exists     (  ùêö  ,  b  )   ‚àà   K   r  +  1         a  b    superscript  K    r  1      (\textbf{a},b)\in K^{r+1}   such that     f   (  ùêö  ,  b  )    =  0        f   a  b    0    f(\textbf{a},b)=0   and     g   (  ùêö  )    ‚â†  0        g  a   0    g(\textbf{a})\not=0   .  Each absolutely irreducible polynomial    f  ‚àà   K   [  T  ,  X  ]        f    K   T  X      f\in K[T,X]   has infinitely many   K   K   K   -rational points.  If   R   R   R   is a finitely generated integral domain over   K   K   K   with quotient field which is regular over   K   K   K   , then there exist a homomorphism    h  :   R  ‚Üí  K      normal-:  h   normal-‚Üí  R  K     h:R\to K   such that     h   (  a  )    =  a        h  a   a    h(a)=a   for each    a  ‚àà  K      a  K    a\in K      Examples   Algebraically closed fields and separably closed fields are always PAC.    Pseudo-finite fields and hyper-finite fields are PAC.    A non-principal ultraproduct of distinct finite fields is (pseudo-finite and hence 3 ) PAC. 4 Ax deduces this from the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields . 5    Infinite algebraic extensions of finite fields are PAC. 6    The PAC Nullstellensatz . The absolute Galois group    G   G   G   of a field   K   K   K   is profinite , hence compact , and hence equipped with a normalized Haar measure . Let   K   K   K   be a countable Hilbertian field and let   e   e   e   be a positive integer. Then for almost all   e   e   e   -tuple     (   œÉ  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   œÉ  e   )   ‚àà   G  e         subscript  œÉ  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  œÉ  e     superscript  G  e     (\sigma_{1},...,\sigma_{e})\in G^{e}   , the fixed field of the subgroup generated by the automorphisms is PAC. Here the phrase "almost all" means "all but a set of measure zero". 7 (This result is a consequence of Hilbert's irreducibility theorem.)    Let K be the maximal totally real  Galois extension of the rational numbers and i the square root of -1. Then K ( i ) is PAC.   Properties   The Brauer group of a PAC field is trivial, 8 as any Severi‚ÄìBrauer variety has a rational point. 9  The absolute Galois group of a PAC field is a projective profinite group ; equivalently, it has cohomological dimension at most 1. 10  A PAC field of characteristic zero is C1 . 11   References     "  Category:Algebraic geometry  Category:Field theory     Fried & Jarden (2008) p.218 ‚Ü©   Fried & Jarden (2008) p.449 ‚Ü©  Fried & Jarden (2008) p.192 ‚Ü©   Fried & Jarden (2008) p.196 ‚Ü©  Fried & Jarden (2008) p.380 ‚Ü©  Fried & Jarden (2008) p.209 ‚Ü©   Fried & Jarden (2008) p.210 ‚Ü©  Fried & Jarden (2008) p.462 ‚Ü©
