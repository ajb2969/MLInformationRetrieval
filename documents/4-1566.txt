   Primitive cell      Primitive cell   A primitive cell is a unit cell constructed so that it contains only one lattice point (each vertex of the cell sits on a lattice point which is shared with the surrounding cells, each lattice point is said to contribute 1/n to the total number of lattice points in the cell where n is the number of cells sharing the lattice point). 1 A primitive cell is built on the primitive basis of the direct lattice , namely a crystallographic basis of the vector lattice L such that every lattice vector t of L may be obtained as an integral linear combination of the basis vectors, a, b, c.  Used predominantly in geometry , solid state physics , and mineralogy , particularly in describing crystal structure , a primitive cell is a minimum volume cell corresponding to a single lattice point of a structure with translational symmetry in 2 dimensions, 3 dimensions, or other dimensions. A lattice can be characterized by the geometry of its primitive cell .  The primitive cell is a fundamental domain with respect to translational symmetry only. In the case of additional symmetries a fundamental domain is smaller.  A crystal can be categorized by its lattice and the atoms that lie in a primitive cell (the basis ). A cell will fill all the lattice space without leaving gaps by repetition of crystal translation operations.  Primitive translation vectors are used to define a crystal translation vector,    T  →     normal-→  T    \vec{T}   , and also gives a lattice cell of smallest volume for a particular lattice. The lattice and translation vectors     a  →   1     subscript   normal-→  a   1    \vec{a}_{1}   ,     a  →   2     subscript   normal-→  a   2    \vec{a}_{2}   , and     a  →   3     subscript   normal-→  a   3    \vec{a}_{3}   are primitive if the atoms look the same from any lattice points using integers    u  1     subscript  u  1    u_{1}   ,    u  2     subscript  u  2    u_{2}   , and    u  3     subscript  u  3    u_{3}   .       T  →   =     u  1     a  →   1    +    u  2     a  →   2    +    u  3     a  →   3          normal-→  T        subscript  u  1    subscript   normal-→  a   1       subscript  u  2    subscript   normal-→  a   2       subscript  u  3    subscript   normal-→  a   3       \vec{T}=u_{1}\vec{a}_{1}+u_{2}\vec{a}_{2}+u_{3}\vec{a}_{3}     The primitive cell is defined by the primitive axes (vectors)     a  →   1     subscript   normal-→  a   1    \vec{a}_{1}   ,     a  →   2     subscript   normal-→  a   2    \vec{a}_{2}   , and     a  →   3     subscript   normal-→  a   3    \vec{a}_{3}   . The volume,    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   , of the primitive cell is given by the parallelepiped from the above axes as        V  p   =   |     a  →   1   ⋅   (     a  →   2   ×    a  →   3    )    |    .       subscript  V  p      normal-⋅   subscript   normal-→  a   1      subscript   normal-→  a   2    subscript   normal-→  a   3        V_{p}=|\vec{a}_{1}\cdot(\vec{a}_{2}\times\vec{a}_{3})|.
