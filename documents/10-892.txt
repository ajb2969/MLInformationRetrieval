   5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydroquinoline dehydrogenase      5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydroquinoline dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydroquinoline dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydroquinoline + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydroquinoline and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2-dihydroquinoline , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,6-dihydroxy-3-methyl-2-oxo-1,2,5,6-tetrahydroquinoline:NAD+ oxidoreductase .
