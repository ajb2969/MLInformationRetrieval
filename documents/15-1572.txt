DTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose transaminase

DTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose transaminase (, TylB, TDP-3-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose 3-aminotransferase, TDP-3-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose 3-aminotransferase, dTDP-3-keto-6-deoxy-D-glucose 3-aminotransferase, dTDP-3-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose 3-aminotransferase) is an enzyme with system name dTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

dTDP-3-amino-3,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose + 2-oxoglutarate

 
  dTDP-3-dehydro-6-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranose + L-glutamate


This enzyme is a pyridoxal-phosphate protein.
