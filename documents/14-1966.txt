Distortion risk measure

In financial mathematics, a distortion risk measure is a type of risk measure which is related to the cumulative distribution function of the return of a financial portfolio.
Mathematical definition
The function 
 
 
 
  associated with the distortion function

 
  is a distortion risk measure if for any random variable of gains 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is the Lp space) then


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the cumulative distribution function for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the dual distortion function 
 
 
 
 .1
If 
 
 
almost surely then 
 
 
 
  is given by the Choquet integral, i.e. 
 
 
23 Equivalently, 
 
 
4 such that 
 
 
 
  is the probability measure generated by 
 
 
 
 , i.e. for any 
 
 
 
  the sigma-algebra then 
 
 
 
 .5
Properties
In addition to the properties of general risk measures, distortion risk measures also have:

Law invariant: If the distribution of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the same then 
 
 
 
 .
Monotone with respect to first order stochastic dominance.
 
If 
 
 
 
  is a concave distortion function, then 
 
 
 
  is monotone with respect to second order stochastic dominance.



 
  is a concave distortion function if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a coherent risk measure.67
