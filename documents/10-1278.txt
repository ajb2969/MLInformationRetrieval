   Carboxylate reductase      Carboxylate reductase   In enzymology , a carboxylate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an aldehyde + acceptor + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a carboxylate + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are aldehyde , acceptor , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are carboxylate and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aldehyde:acceptor oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called aldehyde:(acceptor) oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , tungsten .  References     "  Category:EC 1.2.99  Category:Tungsten enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
