Quantum dynamical semigroup

In quantum mechanics, and especially the theory of open quantum systems, a quantum dynamical semigroup is family of quantum dynamical maps

 
  on the space of density matrices indexed by a single time parameter 
 
 
 
  that obey the semigroup property


 
  A quantum dynamical semigroup is generated by a Lindblad superoperator. The generator can be obtained by


 
  which, by the linearity of 
 
 
 
 , is a linear superoperator. The semigroup can be recovered as
