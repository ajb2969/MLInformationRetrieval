   Butyrate—acetoacetate CoA-transferase      Butyrate—acetoacetate CoA-transferase   In enzymology , a butyrate-acetoacetate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   butanoyl-CoA + acetoacetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   butanoate + acetoacetyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are butanoyl-CoA and acetoacetate , whereas its two products are butanoate and acetoacetyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is butanoyl-CoA:acetoacetate CoA-transferase . Other names in common use include butyryl coenzyme A-acetoacetate coenzyme A-transferase , and butyryl-CoA-acetoacetate CoA-transferase .
