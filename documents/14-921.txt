Inflation-restriction exact sequence

In mathematics, the inflation-restriction exact sequence is an exact sequence occurring in group cohomology and is a special case of the five-term exact sequence arising from the study of spectral sequences.
Specifically, let G be a group, N a normal subgroup, and A an abelian group which is equipped with an action of G, i.e., a homomorphism from G to the automorphism group of A. The quotient group G/N acts on ''AN = { a 
 
 
 
  A : na = a '' for all '' n 
 
 
 
  N}''. Then the inflation-restriction exact sequence is:


0 → H 1(G/N, AN) → H 1(G, A) → H 1(N, A)G/N → H 2(G/N, AN) →H 2(G, A)
 





In this sequence, there are maps

inflation H 1(G/N, AN) → H 1(G, A)
restriction H 1(G, A) → H 1(N, A)G/N
transgression H 1(N, A)G/N → H 2(G/N, AN)
inflation H 2(G/N, AN) →H 2(G, A)

The inflation and restriction are defined for general n:

inflation Hn(G/N, AN) → Hn(G, A)
restriction Hn(G, A) → Hn(N, A)G/N

The transgression is defined for general n

transgression Hn(N, A)G/N → Hn+1(G/N, AN)

only if Hi(N, A)G/N = 0 for i ≤ n-1.1
The sequence for general n may be deduced from the case n=1 by dimension-shifting or from the Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence.2
