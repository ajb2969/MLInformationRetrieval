   Inflation-restriction exact sequence      Inflation-restriction exact sequence   In mathematics, the inflation-restriction exact sequence is an exact sequence occurring in group cohomology and is a special case of the five-term exact sequence arising from the study of spectral sequences .  Specifically, let G be a group , N a normal subgroup , and A an abelian group which is equipped with an action of G , i.e., a homomorphism from G to the automorphism group of A . The quotient group G/N acts on ''A N = { a   ∈     \in   A : na = a '' for all '' n   ∈     \in   N}''. Then the inflation-restriction exact sequence is:    0 → H 1 ( G / N , A N ) → H 1 ( G , A ) → H 1 ( N , A ) G / N → H 2 ( G / N , A N ) → H 2 ( G , A )       In this sequence, there are maps   inflation  H 1 ( G / N , A N ) → H 1 ( G , A )  restriction  H 1 ( G , A ) → H 1 ( N , A ) G / N  transgression  H 1 ( N , A ) G / N → H 2 ( G / N , A N )  inflation  H 2 ( G / N , A N ) → H 2 ( G , A )   The inflation and restriction are defined for general n :   inflation  H n ( G / N , A N ) → H n ( G , A )  restriction  H n ( G , A ) → H n ( N , A ) G / N   The transgression is defined for general n   transgression  H n ( N , A ) G / N → H n +1 ( G / N , A N )   only if H i ( N , A ) G / N = 0 for i ≤ n -1. 1  The sequence for general n may be deduced from the case n =1 by dimension-shifting or from the Lyndon–Hochschild–Serre spectral sequence . 2  References          "  Category:Homological algebra     Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.67 ↩  Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.68 ↩
