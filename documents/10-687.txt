   (-)-menthol dehydrogenase      (-)-menthol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a (−)-menthol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (−)-menthol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (−)-menthone + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (−)-menthol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are (−)-menthone , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (−)-menthol:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called monoterpenoid dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis.
