   Total angular momentum quantum number      Total angular momentum quantum number   In quantum mechanics , the total angular momentum quantum number parameterises the total angular momentum of a given particle , by combining its orbital angular momentum and its intrinsic angular momentum (i.e., its spin ).  If s is the particle's spin angular momentum and ℓ its orbital angular momentum vector, the total angular momentum j is      𝐣  =   𝐬  +  ℓ       𝐣    𝐬  bold-ℓ     \mathbf{j}=\mathbf{s}+\boldsymbol{\ell}     The associated quantum number is the main total angular momentum quantum number  j . It can take the following range of values, jumping only in integer steps:       |   ℓ  -  s   |   ≤  j  ≤   ℓ  +  s             normal-ℓ  s    j         normal-ℓ  s      |\ell-s|\leq j\leq\ell+s     where ℓ is the azimuthal quantum number (parameterizing the orbital angular momentum) and s is the spin quantum number (parameterizing the spin).  The relation between the total angular momentum vector j and the total angular momentum quantum number j is given by the usual relation (see angular momentum quantum number )       ∥  𝐣  ∥   =       j    (   j  +  1   )      ℏ        norm  𝐣         j    j  1     Planck-constant-over-2-pi     \|\mathbf{j}\|=\sqrt{j\,(j+1)}\,\hbar     the vector's z -projection is given by       j  z   =     m  j    ℏ        subscript  j  z      subscript  m  j   Planck-constant-over-2-pi     j_{z}=m_{j}\,\hbar     where m j is the secondary total angular momentum quantum number . It ranges from − j to + j in steps of one. This generates 2 j + 1 different values of m j .  The total angular momentum corresponds to the Casimir invariant of the Lie algebra  so (3) of the three-dimensional rotation group .
