Conformal Killing equation

In conformal geometry, the conformal Killing equation on a manifold of space-dimension n with metric

 
  describes those vector fields 
 
 
 
  which preserve 
 
 
 
  up to scale, i.e.


 
  for some function 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is the Lie derivative). Vector fields that satisfy the conformal Killing equation are exactly those vector fields whose flow preserves the conformal structure of the manifold. The name Killing refers to Wilhelm Killing, who first investigated the Killing equation for vector fields that preserve a Riemannian metric.
By taking the trace we find that necessarily 
 
 
 
 . Therefore we can write the conformal Killing equation as


 
  In abstract indices,


 
  where the round brackets denote symmetrization.
For any 
 
 
 
  but 2, there is a finite number of solutions, specifying the conformal symmetry of that space, but in two dimensions, there is an infinity of solutions.
