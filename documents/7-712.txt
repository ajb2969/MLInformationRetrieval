   Multiple-conclusion logic      Multiple-conclusion logic   A multiple-conclusion logic is one in which logical consequence is a relation ,   ⊢   proves   \vdash   , between two sets of sentences (or propositions ).    Γ  ⊢  Δ     proves  normal-Γ  normal-Δ    \Gamma\vdash\Delta   is typically interpreted as meaning that whenever each element of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is true, some element of   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is true; and whenever each element of   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is false, some element of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is false.  This form of logic was developed in the 1970s by D. J. Shoesmith and Timothy Smiley 1 but has not been widely adopted.  Some logicians favor a multiple-conclusion consequence relation over the more traditional single-conclusion relation on the grounds that the latter is asymmetric (in the informal, non-mathematical sense) and favors truth over falsity (or assertion over denial).
