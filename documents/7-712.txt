Multiple-conclusion logic




Multiple-conclusion logic

A multiple-conclusion logic is one in which logical consequence is a relation, 
 
 
 
 , between two sets of sentences (or propositions). 
 
 
 
  is typically interpreted as meaning that whenever each element of 
 
 
 
 
  is true, some element of 
 
 
 
  is true; and whenever each element of 
 
 
 
  is false, some element of 
 
 
 
  is false.
This form of logic was developed in the 1970s by D. J. Shoesmith and Timothy Smiley1 but has not been widely adopted.
Some logicians favor a multiple-conclusion consequence relation over the more traditional single-conclusion relation on the grounds that the latter is asymmetric (in the informal, non-mathematical sense) and favors truth over falsity (or assertion over denial).
