   L-arabinitol 2-dehydrogenase      L-arabinitol 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a L-arabinitol 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-arabinitol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-ribulose + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-arabinitol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are L-ribulose , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arabinitol:NAD + 2-oxidoreductase (L-ribulose-forming) . Other names in common use include L-arabinitol dehydrogenase (ribulose-forming) , and L-arabinitol (ribulose-forming) dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
