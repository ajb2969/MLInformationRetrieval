   Combinant      Combinant   In the mathematical theory of probability , the combinants  c n of a random variable X are defined via the combinant-generating function  G ( t ), which is defined from the moment generating function  M ( z ) as        G  X    (  t  )    =    M  X    (   log   (   1  +  t   )    )           subscript  G  X   t      subscript  M  X       1  t       G_{X}(t)=M_{X}(\log(1+t))     which can be expressed directly in terms of a random variable X as          G  X    (  t  )    :=   E   [    (   1  +  t   )   X   ]     ,   t  ∈  ℝ    ,     formulae-sequence   assign     subscript  G  X   t     E   delimited-[]   superscript    1  t   X        t  ℝ     G_{X}(t):=E\left[(1+t)^{X}\right],\quad t\in\mathbb{R},     wherever this expectation exists.  The n th combinant can be obtained as the n th derivatives of the logarithm of combinant generating function evaluated at –1 divided by n factorial:       c  n   =      1   n  !      ∂  n    ∂   t  n      log   (   G   (  t  )    )     |    t  =   -  1          subscript  c  n    evaluated-at      1    n       superscript   n      superscript  t  n         G  t       t    1       c_{n}=\frac{1}{n!}\frac{\partial^{n}}{\partial t^{n}}\log(G(t))\bigg|_{t=-1}     Important features in common with the cumulants are:   the combinants share the additivity property of the cumulants;  for infinite divisibility (probability) distributions, both sets of moments are strictly positive.
