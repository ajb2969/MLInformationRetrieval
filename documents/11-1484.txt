   Farnesyl-diphosphate kinase      Farnesyl-diphosphate kinase   In enzymology , a farnesyl-diphosphate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + farnesyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + farnesyl triphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and farnesyl diphosphate , whereas its two products are ADP and farnesyl triphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:farnesyl-diphosphate phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called farnesyl pyrophosphate kinase .
