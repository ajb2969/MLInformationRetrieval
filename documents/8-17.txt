Hemicompact space

In mathematics, in the field of topology, a topological space is said to be hemicompact if it has a sequence of compact subsets such that every compact subset of the space lies inside some compact set in the sequence. Clearly, this forces the union of the sequence to be the whole space, because every point is compact and hence must lie in one of the compact sets.
Examples

Every compact space is hemicompact.
The real line is hemicompact.
Every locally compact Lindelöf space is hemicompact.

Properties
Every hemicompact space is σ-compact and if in addition it is first countable then it is locally compact.
If 
 
 
 
  is a hemicompact space, then the space 
 
 
 
  of all continuous functions 
 
 
 
  to a metric space

 
  with the compact-open topology is metrizable. To see this, take a sequence 
 
 
 
  of compact subsets of 
 
 
 
  such that every compact subset of 
 
 
 
  lies inside some compact set in this sequence (the existence of such a sequence follows from the hemicompactness of 
 
 
 
 ). Denote


 
  for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then


 
  defines a metric on 
 
 
 
  which induces the compact-open topology.
