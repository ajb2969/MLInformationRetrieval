Analytic polyhedron

In mathematics, especially several complex variables, an analytic polyhedron is a subset of the complex space  of the form



where 
 
 
 
  is a bounded connected open subset of  and 
 
 
 
  are holomorphic on 
 
 
 
 .1 If 
 
 
 
  above are polynomials, then the set is called a polynomial polyhedron. Every analytic polyhedron is a domain of holomorphy and it is thus pseudo-convex.
The boundary of an analytic polyhedron is the union of the set of hypersurfaces



An analytic polyhedron is a Weil polyhedron, or Weil domain if the intersection of 
 
 
 
  hypersurfaces has dimension no greater than
