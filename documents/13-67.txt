   Analytic polyhedron      Analytic polyhedron   In mathematics , especially several complex variables , an analytic polyhedron is a subset of the complex space  of the form      {   z  ∈  D   :     |    f  j    (  z  )    |   <  1   ,   1  ≤  j  ≤  N    }     conditional-set    z  D    formulae-sequence         subscript  f  j   z    1       1  j       N       \{z\in D:|f_{j}(z)|<1,1\leq j\leq N\}\,     where   D   D   D   is a bounded connected open subset of and    f  j     subscript  f  j    f_{j}   are holomorphic on   D   D   D   . 1 If    f  j     subscript  f  j    f_{j}   above are polynomials, then the set is called a polynomial polyhedron . Every analytic polyhedron is a domain of holomorphy and it is thus pseudo-convex .  The boundary of an analytic polyhedron is the union of the set of hypersurfaces         σ  j   =   {   z  ∈  D   :    |    f  j    (  z  )    |   =  1   }    ,   1  ≤  j  ≤  N    .     formulae-sequence     subscript  σ  j    conditional-set    z  D          subscript  f  j   z    1         1  j       N      \sigma_{j}=\{z\in D:|f_{j}(z)|=1\},1\leq j\leq N.     An analytic polyhedron is a Weil polyhedron , or Weil domain if the intersection of   k   k   k   hypersurfaces has dimension no greater than     2  n   -  k        2  n   k    2n-k   . 2  See also   Behnke–Stein theorem  Bergman–Weil formula   Notes  References    .
