   Valuation (measure theory)      Valuation (measure theory)   In measure theory , or at least in the approach to it via the domain theory , a valuation is a map from the class of open sets of a topological space to the set positive  real numbers including infinity . It is a concept closely related to that of a measure , and as such, it finds applications in measure theory, probability theory , and theoretical computer science .  Domain/Measure theory definition  Let    (  X  ,  𝒯  )     X  𝒯    \scriptstyle(X,\mathcal{T})   be a topological space: a valuation is any map      v  :   𝒯  →    ℝ  +   ∪   {   +  ∞   }        normal-:  v   normal-→  𝒯     superscript  ℝ              v:\mathcal{T}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}\cup\{+\infty\}     satisfying the following three properties          v   (  ∅  )    =  0      Strictness property        v   (  U  )    ≤   v   (  V  )           if   U   ⊆   V  U    ,   V  ∈  𝒯      Monotonicity property         v   (   U  ∪  V   )    +   v   (   U  ∩  V   )     =    v   (  U  )    +   v   (  V  )           ∀  U   ,  V   ∈  𝒯     Modularity property            v    0    missing-subexpression   Strictness property        v  U     v  V     formulae-sequence      if  U    V  U      V  𝒯    Monotonicity property          v    U  V      v    U  V         v  U     v  V         for-all  U   V   𝒯   Modularity property     \begin{array}[]{lll}v(\varnothing)=0&&\scriptstyle{\text{Strictness property}}%
 \\
 v(U)\leq v(V)&\mbox{if}~{}U\subseteq V\quad U,V\in\mathcal{T}&\scriptstyle{%
 \text{Monotonicity property}}\\
 v(U\cup V)+v(U\cap V)=v(U)+v(V)&\forall U,V\in\mathcal{T}&\scriptstyle{\text{%
 Modularity property}}\end{array}     The definition immediately shows the relationship between a valuation and a measure: the properties of the two mathematical object are often very similar if not identical, the only difference being that the domain of a measure is the Borel algebra of the given topological space, while the domain of a valuation is the class of open sets. Further details and references can be found in  and .  Continuous valuation  A valuation (as defined in domain theory/measure theory) is said to be continuous if for every directed family      {   U  i   }    i  ∈  I      subscript    subscript  U  i      i  I     \scriptstyle\{U_{i}\}_{i\in I}    of open sets (i.e. an indexed family of open sets which is also directed in the sense that for each pair of indexes   i   i   i   and   j   j   j   belonging to the index set    I   I   I   , there exists an index   k   k   k   such that     U  i   ⊆   U  k        subscript  U  i    subscript  U  k     \scriptstyle U_{i}\subseteq U_{k}   and     U  j   ⊆   U  k        subscript  U  j    subscript  U  k     \scriptstyle U_{j}\subseteq U_{k}   ) the following equality holds:        v   (    ⋃   i  ∈  I     U  i    )    =    sup   i  ∈  I     v   (   U  i   )      .        v    subscript     i  I     subscript  U  i       subscript  supremum    i  I      v   subscript  U  i       v\left(\bigcup_{i\in I}U_{i}\right)=\sup_{i\in I}v(U_{i}).     Simple valuation  A valuation (as defined in domain theory/measure theory) is said to be simple if it is a finite  linear combination with non-negative  coefficients of Dirac valuations , i.e.        v   (  U  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     a  i    δ   x  i     (  U  )        ∀  U   ∈  𝒯      formulae-sequence      v  U     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  a  i    subscript  δ   subscript  x  i    U        for-all  U   𝒯     v(U)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}\delta_{x_{i}}(U)\quad\forall U\in\mathcal{T}     where    a  i     subscript  a  i    a_{i}   is always greather than or at least equal to zero for all index   i   i   i   . Simple valuations are obviously continuous in the above sense. The supremum of a directed family of simple valuations (i.e. an indexed family of simple valuations which is also directed in the sense that for each pair of indexes   i   i   i   and   j   j   j   belonging to the index set   I   I   I   , there exists an index   k   k   k   such that      v  i    (  U  )    ≤    v  k    (  U  )           subscript  v  i   U      subscript  v  k   U     \scriptstyle v_{i}(U)\leq v_{k}(U)\!   and      v  j    (  U  )    ⊆    v  k    (  U  )           subscript  v  j   U      subscript  v  k   U     \scriptstyle v_{j}(U)\subseteq v_{k}(U)\!   ) is called quasi-simple valuation          v  ¯    (  U  )    =    sup   i  ∈  I      v  i    (  U  )        ∀  U   ∈  𝒯    .     formulae-sequence       normal-¯  v   U     subscript  supremum    i  I       subscript  v  i   U        for-all  U   𝒯     \bar{v}(U)=\sup_{i\in I}v_{i}(U)\quad\forall U\in\mathcal{T}.\,     See also   The extension problem for a given valuation (in the sense of domain theory/measure theory) consists in finding under what type of conditions it can be extended to a measure on a proper topological space, which may or may not be the same space where it is defined: the papers  and  in the reference section are devoted to this aim and give also several historical details.  The concepts of valuation on convex sets and valuation on manifolds are a generalization of valuation in the sense of domain /measure theory. A valuation on convex sets is allowed to assume complex values , and the underlying topological space is the set of non-empty convex compact subsets of a finite-dimensional vector space : a valuation on manifolds is a complex valued finitely additive measure defined on a proper subset of the class of all compact submanifolds of the given manifolds . Details can be found in several arxiv  papers of prof. Semyon Alesker.   Examples  Dirac valuation  Let    (  X  ,  𝒯  )     X  𝒯    \scriptstyle(X,\mathcal{T})   be a topological space, and let    x   x   x    be a point of    X   X   X    : the map         δ  x    (  U  )    =   {     0       if   x   ∉  U       1       if   x   ∈  U          ∀  U   ∈  𝒯      formulae-sequence       subscript  δ  x   U    cases  0      if  x   U   1      if  x   U        for-all  U   𝒯     \delta_{x}(U)=\begin{cases}0&\mbox{if}~{}x\notin U\\
 1&\mbox{if}~{}x\in U\end{cases}\quad\forall U\in\mathcal{T}   is a valuation in the domain theory/measure theory, sense called Dirac valuation . This concept bears its origin from distribution theory as it is an obvious transposition to valuation theory of Dirac distribution : as seen above, Dirac valuations are the " bricks " simple valuations are made of.
