   Glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase      Glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:alpha-D-glucosamine-1-phosphate N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
