 An example of multi-bead FENE model

FENE stands for the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic model of a long-chained polymer. It simplifies the chain of monomers by connecting a sequence of beads with nonlinear springs. The spring force law is governed by inverse Langevin function or approximated by the Warner's relationship
