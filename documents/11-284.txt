   FENE      FENE   (Figure)  An example of multi-bead FENE model   FENE stands for the finitely extensible nonlinear elastic model of a long-chained polymer . It simplifies the chain of monomers by connecting a sequence of beads with nonlinear springs. The spring force law is governed by inverse Langevin function or approximated by the Warner's relationship       F  i   =    H   R  i     1  -    (    R  i   /   L   m  a  x     )   2          subscript  F  i       H   subscript  R  i      1   superscript     subscript  R  i    subscript  L    m  a  x     2       F_{i}=\frac{HR_{i}}{1-(R_{i}/L_{max})^{2}}     See also   FENE-P   References   Dynamics of dissolved polymer chains in isotropic turbulence   External links   QPolymer: an open source (for Mac OS X) FENE model Brownian dynamics simulation software   "  Category:Polymers
