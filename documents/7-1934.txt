A circular mil is a unit of area, equal to the area of a circle with a diameter of one mil (one thousandth of an inch). It corresponds to 5.067×10−4 mm². It is a unit intended for referring to the area of a wire with a circular cross section. As the area in circular mils can be calculated without reference to π, the unit makes conversion between cross section and diameter of a wire considerably easier.
The area in circular mils, A, of a circle with a diameter of d mils, is given by the formula:



Electricians in Canada and the United States are familiar with the circular mil because the National Electrical Code (NEC) uses the circular mil to define wire sizes larger than 0000 AWG. In many NEC publications and uses, large wires may be expressed in thousands of circular mils, which is abbreviated in two different ways: MCM1 or kcmil.2 For example, one common wire size used in the NEC has a cross-section of 250,000 circular mils, written as 250 kcmil or 250 MCM, which is the first size larger than 0000 AWG used within the NEC.
Equivalence to other units of area
Although square mils are rarely used, it is convenient to convert between square inches and circular mils. As a classic example taken from the NEC, a 0000 AWG solid wire is defined to have a diameter of exactly 0.46 inch.
Formula 1: Square Mil

Note: 1 inch = 1000 mils



 
  inch = 460 mils
 





 
  = 211,600 circular mils
 
(This is the same result as the AWG circular mil formula shown below for n=-3)

Therefore, the following conversions apply: 
 *'''To obtain square mils   ⇒ (''# of circular mils'') × π ÷ 4 '''
 *'''To obtain square inches ⇒ (''# of circular mils'') × π ÷ 4,000,000'''
 *'''To obtain circular mils ⇒ (''# of square mils'')   × 4 ÷ π '''
 *'''To obtain circular mils ⇒ (''# of square inches'') × 4,000,000 ÷ π'''
 
1 circular mil is approximately equal to:

0.7854 square mils (1 square mil is about 1.273 circular mils)
7.854×10−7 square inches (1 square inch is about 1.273 million circular mils)
5.067×10−10 square metres
506.7 μm²

1000 circular mils = 1 MCM or 1 kcmil, and is (approximately) equal to:

0.5067 mm², so 2 kcmil ≈ 1 mm² (a 1.3% error)

Therefore, for practical purposes such as wire choice, 2 kcmil ≈ 1 mm² is a reasonable rule of thumb for many applications.
When large diameter wire sizes are specified in kcmil, such as the ubiquitous 250 kcmil or 350 kcmil wires, the wire's diameter can be easily determined with the following formula:
Formula 6: Diameter

Note: We first convert from kcmil to circular mil

  = 500 mils = 0.500 inch
 

Thus, this wire would have a diameter of a half inch or 12.7 mm.
AWG circular mil formula
The formula to calculate the circular mil for any given AWG (American Wire Gauge) size is as follows. An represents the circular mil area for the AWG size n.




For example, a number 12 gauge wire would use n = 12; and the calculated result would be 6529.946789 circular mils

Sizes with multiple zeros are successively larger than the number 0 gauge size and can be denoted using "number of zeros/0"; for example 4/0 for the number 0000 gauge. For an m/0 AWG wire size, use

n = −(m−1) = 1−m in the above formula.
 

For example, the number 0000 gauge or 4/0 gauge, would use n = −3; and the calculated result would be 211,600 circular mils.
Standard sizes
Standard sizes are from 250 to 400 in increments of 50 kcmil, 400 to 1000 in increments of 100 kcmil, and from 1000 to 2000 in increments of 250 kcmil.3
The diameter in the table below is that of a solid rod with the given conductor area in circular mils. Stranded wire is around 5% larger in diameter to allow for gaps between the strands, depending on the number and size of strands.

Circular inch
Cardarelli has asserted that the "circular inch" (cin) was used as a unit for the measurement of wire sizes, with a conversion of 1 circular inch = 1,000,000 circular mil.4 The Oxford English Dictionary does not acknowledge the use of "circular inch", although it has an entry for "circular mil".5
