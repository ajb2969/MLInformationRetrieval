Plotkin bound

In the mathematics of coding theory, the Plotkin bound, named after Morris Plotkin, is a limit (or bound) on the maximum possible number of codewords in binary codes of given length n and given minimum distance d.
Statement of the bound
A code is considered "binary" if the codewords use symbols from the binary alphabet

 
 . In particular, if all codewords have a fixed length n, then the binary code has length n. Equivalently, in this case the codewords can be considered elements of vector space

 
  over the finite field

 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the minimum distance of 
 
 
 
 , i.e.


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Hamming distance between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The expression 
 
 
 
  represents the maximum number of possible codewords in a binary code of length 
 
 
 
  and minimum distanceÂ 
 
 
 
 . The Plotkin bound places a limit on this expression.
Theorem (Plotkin bound):
i) If 
 
 
 
  is even and 
 
 
 
 , then



ii) If 
 
 
 
  is odd and 
 
 
 
 , then



iii) If 
 
 
 
  is even, then



iv) If 
 
 
 
  is odd, then

  denotes the floor function.
Proof of case i
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Hamming distance of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be the number of elements in 
 
 
 
  (thus, 
 
 
 
  is equal to 
 
 
 
 ). The bound is proved by bounding the quantity 
 
 
 
  in two different ways.
On the one hand, there are 
 
 
 
  choices for 
 
 
 
  and for each such choice, there are 
 
 
 
  choices for 
 
 
 
 . Since by definition 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
 ), it follows that



On the other hand, let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
  matrix whose rows are the elements of 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the number of zeros contained in the 
 
 
 
 'th column of 
 
 
 
 . This means that the 
 
 
 
 'th column contains 
 
 
 
  ones. Each choice of a zero and a one in the same column contributes exactly 
 
 
 
  (because 
 
 
 
 ) to the sum 
 
 
 
  and therefore



If 
 
 
 
  is even, then the quantity on the right is maximized if and only if 
 
 
 
  holds for all 
 
 
 
 , then



Combining the upper and lower bounds for 
 
 
 
  that we have just derived,



which given that 
 
 
 
  is equivalent to



Since 
 
 
 
  is even, it follows that



On the other hand, if 
 
 
 
  is odd, then 
 
 
 
  is maximized when 
 
 
 
  which implies that



Combining the upper and lower bounds for 
 
 
 
 , this means that



or, using that 
 
 
 
 ,



Since 
 
 
 
  is an integer,



This completes the proof of the bound.
