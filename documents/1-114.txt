Biconditional elimination

Biconditional elimination is the name of two valid rules of inference of propositional logic. It allows for one to infer a conditional from a biconditional. If 
 
 
 
  is true, then one may infer that 
 
 
 
  is true, and also that 
 
 
 
  is true.1 For example, if it's true that I'm breathing if and only if I'm alive, then it's true that if I'm breathing, I'm alive; likewise, it's true that if I'm alive, I'm breathing. The rules can be stated formally as:


 
  and



where the rule is that wherever an instance of "
 
 
 
 " appears on a line of a proof, either "
 
 
 
 " or "
 
 
 
 " can be placed on a subsequent line;
Formal notation
The biconditional elimination rule may be written in sequent notation:


 
  and



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
 , in the first case, and 
 
 
 
  in the other are syntactic consequences of 
 
 
 
 
  in some logical system;
or as the statement of a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:






where 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
