   Site-specific DNA-methyltransferase (adenine-specific)      Site-specific DNA-methyltransferase (adenine-specific)   Site-specific DNA-methyltransferase (adenine-specific) (, modification methylase , restriction-modification system ) is an enzyme . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + DNA adenine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + DNA 6-methylaminopurine   This is a large group of enzymes. 4  References  See also   DNA methyltransferase   External links     "  Category:EC 2.1.1     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
