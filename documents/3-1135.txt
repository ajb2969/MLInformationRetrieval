   Particle in a ring      Particle in a ring   In quantum mechanics , the case of a particle in a one-dimensional ring is similar to the particle in a box . The Schrödinger equation for a free particle which is restricted to a ring (technically, whose configuration space is the circle     S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   ) is       -     ℏ  2    2  m      ∇  2   ψ     =   E  ψ              superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2     2  m      superscript  normal-∇  2   ψ       E  ψ     -\frac{\hbar^{2}}{2m}\nabla^{2}\psi=E\psi     Wave function  Using polar coordinates on the 1-dimensional ring of radius R, the wave function depends only on the angular  coordinate , and so       ∇  2   =    1   R  2      ∂  2    ∂   θ  2           superscript  normal-∇  2       1   superscript  R  2       superscript   2      superscript  θ  2        \nabla^{2}=\frac{1}{R^{2}}\frac{\partial^{2}}{\partial\theta^{2}}     Requiring that the wave function be periodic in    θ    θ   \ \theta   with a period    2  π      2  π    2\pi   (from the demand that the wave functions be single-valued functions on the circle ), and that they be normalized leads to the conditions        ∫  0   2  π        |   ψ   (  θ  )    |   2    R  d  θ    =  1        superscript   subscript   0     2  π       superscript      ψ  θ    2   R  d  θ    1    \int_{0}^{2\pi}\left|\psi(\theta)\right|^{2}\,Rd\theta=1   ,  and        ψ    (  θ  )    =   ψ   (   θ  +   2  π    )          ψ  θ     ψ    θ    2  π       \ \psi(\theta)=\ \psi(\theta+2\pi)     Under these conditions, the solution to the Schrödinger equation is given by        ψ  ±    (  θ  )    =     1    2  π  R       e   ±   i   R  ℏ     2  m  E    θ             subscript  ψ  plus-or-minus   θ       1      2  π  R      superscript  e   plus-or-minus    i    R  Planck-constant-over-2-pi       2  m  E    θ        \psi_{\pm}(\theta)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi R}}\,e^{\pm i\frac{R}{\hbar}\sqrt{2mE}\theta}     Energy eigenvalues  The energy  eigenvalues    E   E   E   are quantized because of the periodic boundary conditions , and they are required to satisfy       e   ±   i   r  ℏ     2  m  E    θ     =   e   ±   i   r  ℏ     2  m  E     (   θ  +   2  π    )           superscript  e   plus-or-minus    i    r  Planck-constant-over-2-pi       2  m  E    θ      superscript  e   plus-or-minus    i    r  Planck-constant-over-2-pi       2  m  E      θ    2  π         e^{\pm i\frac{r}{\hbar}\sqrt{2mE}\theta}=e^{\pm i\frac{r}{\hbar}\sqrt{2mE}(%

Therefore there are 2n+1 states with energies up to an energy indexed by the number n.  The case of a particle in a one-dimensional ring is an instructive example when studying the quantization of angular momentum for, say, an electron orbiting the nucleus . The azimuthal wave functions in that case are identical to the energy eigenfunctions of the particle on a ring.  The statement that any wavefunction for the particle on a ring can be written as a superposition of energy  eigenfunctions is exactly identical to the Fourier theorem about the development of any periodic function in a Fourier series .  This simple model can be used to find approximate energy levels of some ring molecules, such as benzene.  Application  In organic chemistry , aromatic compounds contain atomic rings, such as benzene rings (the Kekulé structure) consisting of five or six, usually carbon , atoms. So does the surface of " buckyballs " (buckminsterfullerene). These molecules are exceptionally stable.  The above explains why the ring behaves like a circular waveguide , with the valence electrons orbiting in both directions.  To fill all energy levels up to n requires    2  ×   (    2  n   +  1   )       2      2  n   1     2\times(2n+1)   electrons, as electrons have additionally two possible orientations of their spins.  The rule that     4  n   +  2        4  n   2    4n+2   excess electrons in the ring produces an exceptionally stable ("aromatic") compound, is known as the Hückel's rule .  Further in rotational spectroscopy this model may be used as an approximation of rotational energy levels.
