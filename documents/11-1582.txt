   Polynucleotide 5'-hydroxyl-kinase      Polynucleotide 5'-hydroxyl-kinase   In enzymology , a polynucleotide 5'-hydroxyl-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 5'-dephospho-DNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 5'-phospho-DNA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 5'-dephospho-DNA , whereas its two products are ADP and 5'-phospho-DNA . Polynucleotide kinase is a T7 bacteriophage (or T4 bacteriophage ) enzyme that catalyzes the transfer of a gamma- phosphate from ATP to the free hydroxyl end of the 5' DNA or RNA . The resulting product could be used to end-label DNA or RNA, or in a ligation reaction.  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:5'-dephosphopolynucleotide 5'-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include:   ATP:5'-dephosphopolynucleotide 5'-phosphatase  PNK  polynucleotide 5'-hydroxyl kinase (phosphorylating),  5'-hydroxyl polynucleotide kinase,  5'-hydroxyl polyribonucleotide kinase,  5'-hydroxyl RNA kinase,  DNA 5'-hydroxyl kinase,  DNA kinase,  polynucleotide kinase, and  polynucleotide 5'-hydroxy-kinase.
