   Holomorphically convex hull      Holomorphically convex hull   In mathematics , more precisely in complex analysis , the holomorphically convex hull of a given compact set in the n - dimensional  complex space C n is defined as follows.  Let    G  ⊂   ℂ  n       G   superscript  ℂ  n     G\subset{\mathbb{C}}^{n}   be a domain (an open and connected  set ), or alternatively for a more general definition, let   G   G   G   be an   n   n   n   dimensional complex analytic manifold . Further let    𝒪   (  G  )       𝒪  G    {\mathcal{O}}(G)   stand for the set of holomorphic functions on    G  .    G   G.   For a compact set    K  ⊂  G      K  G    K\subset G   , the holomorphically convex hull of   K   K   K   is         K  ^   G   :=   {   z  ∈  G   |    |   f   (  z  )    |   ≤    sup   w  ∈  K      |   f   (  w  )    |   for all  f    ∈   𝒪   (  G  )     }    .     assign   subscript   normal-^  K   G    conditional-set    z  G           f  z      subscript  supremum    w  K          f  w    for all  f           𝒪  G        \hat{K}_{G}:=\{z\in G\big|\left|f(z)\right|\leq\sup_{w\in K}\left|f(w)\right|%
 \mbox{ for all }f\in{\mathcal{O}}(G)\}.     (One obtains a narrower concept of polynomially convex hull by requiring in the above definition that f be a polynomial .)  The domain   G   G   G   is called holomorphically convex if for every    K  ⊂  G      K  G    K\subset G   compact in   G   G   G   ,     K  ^   G     subscript   normal-^  K   G    \hat{K}_{G}   is also compact in   G   G   G   . Sometimes this is just abbreviated as holomorph-convex .  When    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   , any domain   G   G   G   is holomorphically convex since then     K  ^   G     subscript   normal-^  K   G    \hat{K}_{G}   is the union of   K   K   K   with the relatively compact components of     G  ∖  K   ⊂  G        G  K   G    G\setminus K\subset G   . Also note that being holomorphically convex is the same as being a domain of holomorphy (The Cartan–Thullen theorem). These concepts are more important in the case n > 1 of several complex variables .  See also   Stein manifold  Pseudoconvexity   References   Lars Hörmander .
