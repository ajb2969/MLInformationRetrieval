Holomorphically convex hull

In mathematics, more precisely in complex analysis, the holomorphically convex hull of a given compact set in the n-dimensional complex space Cn is defined as follows.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a domain (an open and connected set), or alternatively for a more general definition, let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
  dimensional complex analytic manifold. Further let 
 
 
 
  stand for the set of holomorphic functions on 
 
 
 
 
  For a compact set 
 
 
 
 , the holomorphically convex hull of 
 
 
 
  is



(One obtains a narrower concept of polynomially convex hull by requiring in the above definition that f be a polynomial.)
The domain 
 
 
 
  is called holomorphically convex if for every 
 
 
 
 
  compact in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is also compact in 
 
 
 
 . Sometimes this is just abbreviated as holomorph-convex.
When 
 
 
 
 , any domain 
 
 
 
 
  is holomorphically convex since then 
 
 
 
  is the union of 
 
 
 
  with the relatively compact components of 
 
 
 
 . Also note that being holomorphically convex is the same as being a domain of holomorphy (The Cartan–Thullen theorem). These concepts are more important in the case n > 1 of several complex variables.
