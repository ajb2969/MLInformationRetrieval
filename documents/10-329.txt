Cameron–Erdős conjecture

In combinatorics, the Cameron–Erdős conjecture (now a theorem) is the statement that the number of sum-free sets contained in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 

The sum of two odd numbers is even, so a set of odd numbers is always sum-free. There are 
 
 
 
  odd numbers in |N|, and so 
 
 
 
  subsets of odd numbers in |N|. The Cameron–Erdős conjecture says that this counts a constant proportion of the sum-free sets.
The conjecture was stated by Peter Cameron and Paul Erdős in 1988.1 It was proved by Ben Green2 and independently by Alexander Sapozhenko34 in 2003.
