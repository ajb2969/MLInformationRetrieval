   Cameron–Erdős conjecture      Cameron–Erdős conjecture   In combinatorics , the Cameron–Erdős conjecture (now a theorem) is the statement that the number of sum-free sets contained in     |  N  |   =   {  1  ,  …  ,  N  }         N    1  normal-…  N     |N|=\{1,\ldots,N\}   is     O   (   2   N  /  2    )    .      O   superscript  2    N  2      O\left({2^{N/2}}\right).     The sum of two odd numbers is even, so a set of odd numbers is always sum-free. There are    ⌈   N  /  2   ⌉        N  2     \lceil N/2\rceil   odd numbers in | N |, and so    2   N  /  2      superscript  2    N  2     2^{N/2}   subsets of odd numbers in | N |. The Cameron–Erdős conjecture says that this counts a constant proportion of the sum-free sets.  The conjecture was stated by Peter Cameron and Paul Erdős in 1988. 1 It was proved by Ben Green 2 and independently by Alexander Sapozhenko 3 4 in 2003.
