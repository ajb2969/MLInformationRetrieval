Reciprocal gamma function 1/Γ(z) in the complex plane. The color of a point z encodes the value of 1/Γ(z). Strong colors denote values close to zero and hue encodes the value's argument.

In mathematics, the reciprocal gamma function is the function



where Γ(z) denotes the gamma function. Since the gamma function is meromorphic and nonzero everywhere in the complex plane, its reciprocal is an entire function. As an entire function, it is of order 1 (meaning that 
 
 
 
  grows no faster than 
 
 
 
 ), but of infinite type (meaning that 
 
 
 
  grows faster than any multiple of |z|, since its growth is approximately proportional to 
 
 
 
  in the left-hand plane).
The reciprocal is sometimes used as a starting point for numerical computation of the gamma function, and a few software libraries provide it separately from the regular gamma function.
Karl Weierstrass called the reciprocal gamma function the "factorielle" and used it in his development of the Weierstrass factorization theorem.
Taylor series
Taylor series expansion around 0 gives



where γ is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. For k > 2, the coefficient ak for the zk term can be computed recursively as



where ζ(s) is the Riemann zeta function. For small values, this gives the following values:

Asymptotic expansion
As |z| goes to infinity at a constant arg(z) we have:



Contour integral representation
An integral representation due to Hermann Hankel is



where C is a path encircling 0 in the positive direction, beginning at and returning to positive infinity with respect for the branch cut along the positive real axis. According to Schmelzer & Trefethen, numerical evaluation of Hankel's integral is the basis of some of the best methods for computing the gamma function.
Integral along the real axis
Integration of the reciprocal gamma function along the positive real axis gives the value



which is known as the Fransén–Robinson constant.
