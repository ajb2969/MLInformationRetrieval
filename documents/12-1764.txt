Electron-capture mass spectrometry

Electron-capture mass spectrometry (EC-MS) is a type of mass spectrometry that uses electron capture ionization (ECI) to form negative ions from chemical compounds with positive electron affinities. The approach is particularly effective for electrophiles. In contrast to electron ionization, EC-MS uses low energy electrons in a gas discharge. The technique can be used with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry.1
Mechanism
The attachment of a low energy electron can give rise to two possible reactions for the compound, as shown below. Either the compound attaches an electron to form a radical anion,


 
 ,
or the compound fragments, resulting in electron capture dissociation (ECD).2 ECD forms an anion fragment and a radical fragment


 
 .
Fragmentation in ECI has been studied by tandem mass spectrometry.3
