   Electron-capture mass spectrometry      Electron-capture mass spectrometry   Electron-capture mass spectrometry ( EC-MS ) is a type of mass spectrometry that uses electron capture ionization (ECI) to form negative ions from chemical compounds with positive electron affinities . The approach is particularly effective for electrophiles . In contrast to electron ionization , EC-MS uses low energy electrons in a gas discharge . The technique can be used with gas chromatography-mass spectrometry . 1  Mechanism  The attachment of a low energy electron can give rise to two possible reactions for the compound, as shown below. Either the compound attaches an electron to form a radical  anion ,        A  B   +   e  -    →   A   B    -  ∙        normal-→      A  B    superscript  e       A   superscript  B    absent  normal-∙       AB+e^{-}\to AB^{-\bullet}   ,  or the compound fragments, resulting in electron capture dissociation (ECD). 2 ECD forms an anion fragment and a radical fragment        A  B   +   e  -    →    A  -   +   B  ∙       normal-→      A  B    superscript  e        superscript  A     superscript  B  normal-∙      AB+e^{-}\to A^{-}+B^{\bullet}   .  Fragmentation in ECI has been studied by tandem mass spectrometry . 3  See also   Electron capture detector   References  "  Category:Ion source     ↩  ↩  ↩
