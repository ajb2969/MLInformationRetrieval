   Yuan-Cheng Fung      Yuan-Cheng Fung   Yuan-Cheng "Bert" Fung (born 1919) is an American bioengineer and scientist. He is regarded as a founding figure of bioengineering , tissue engineering , and the "Founder of Modern Biomechanics ". 1  Biography  Fung was born in Jiangsu Province, China in 1919. He earned a Bachelor's degree in 1941 and a Master's degree in 1943 from the National Central University (later renamed Nanjing University in mainland China and reinstated in Taiwan ), and earned a Ph.D. from the California Institute of Technology in the United States in 1948.  Fung currently is Professor Emeritus and Research Engineer at the University of California, San Diego (UCSD) . He published prominent texts including the bestselling CLASSICAL AND COMPUTATIONAL SOLID MECHANICS (published by World Scientific) along with Pin Tong who was then at Hong Kong University of Science & Technology.  Research  He is the author of numerous books including Foundations of Solid Mechanics, Continuum Mechanics, and a series of books on Biomechanics. He is also one of the principal founders of the Journal of Biomechanics and was a past chair of the ASME International Applied Mechanics Division . In 1972, Fung established the Biomechanics Symposium under the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. This biannual summer meeting, first held at the Georgia Institute of Technology, became the annual Summer Bioengineering Conference. Fung and colleagues were also the first to recognize the importance of residual stress on arterial mechanical behavior. 2  Fung's Law  Fung's famous exponential strain constitutive equation for preconditioned soft tissues is      w  =    1  2    [   q  +   c   (    e  Q   -  1   )     ]        w      1  2    delimited-[]    q    c     superscript  e  Q   1         w=\frac{1}{2}\left[q+c\left(e^{Q}-1\right)\right]   with       q  =    a   i  j  k  l     E   i  j     E   k  l       Q  =    b   i  j  k  l     E   i  j     E   k  l         formulae-sequence    q     subscript  a    i  j  k  l     subscript  E    i  j     subscript  E    k  l        Q     subscript  b    i  j  k  l     subscript  E    i  j     subscript  E    k  l        q=a_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl}\qquad Q=b_{ijkl}E_{ij}E_{kl}   quadratic forms of Green-Lagrange strains     E   i  j      subscript  E    i  j     E_{ij}   and    a   i  j  k  l      subscript  a    i  j  k  l     a_{ijkl}   ,    b   i  j  k  l      subscript  b    i  j  k  l     b_{ijkl}   and   c   c   c   material constants. 3    w   w   w   is a strain energy function per volume unit, which is the mechanical strain energy for a given temperature. Materials that follow this law are known as Fung-elastic . 4  Honors and awards   Theodore von Karman Medal , 1976  Otto Laporte Award , 1977  Worcester Reed Warner Medal, 1984 5  Jean-Leonard-Marie Poiseuille Award, 1986 6  Timoshenko Medal , 1991  Lissner Award for Bioengineering, from ASME  Borelli Medal, from ASB  Landis Award, from Microcirculation Society  Alza Award, from BMES  Melville Medal, 1994 7  United States National Academy of Engineering Founders Award (NAE Founders Award), 1998  National Medal of Science , 2000  Fritz J. and Dolores H.
