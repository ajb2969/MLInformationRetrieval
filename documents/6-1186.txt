   Gamma Lyrae      Gamma Lyrae   Gamma Lyrae (γ Lyr, γ Lyrae) is the second brightest  star in the northern constellation of Lyra . It has the traditional names Sulafat (Sulaphat), from the Arabic al-sulḥafāt "turtle", and Jugum , 1 from the Latin "yoke". The connection with turtles is that fine harps were traditionally made of tortoiseshell . The apparent visual magnitude of Sulafat is 3.3, 2 which is readily visible to the naked eye. Parallax measurements yield an estimated distance of  from the Earth .  This is a giant star with a stellar classification of B9 III, 3 indicating it has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence . The effective temperature of the outer envelope of this star is 10,080 K, 4 giving it the blue-white hue typical of a B-type star. 5 The interferometry -measured angular diameter of this star is , 6 which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of roughly 15 times the radius of the Sun . 7  In 1909, Canadian astronomer Samuel A. Mitchell identified this star as a spectroscopic binary , although he was unable to split the absorption lines of the components. He found that a period of 25.6 days matched his measurements. 8 It was reported as a spectroscopic binary as recently as 2001, 9 but is now believed to be a single star 10 11 with a high rate of rotation for stars of this type. 12  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 30\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 13  14  15  16  17  18  }}  External links     "  Category:Lyra (constellation)  Lyrae, Gamma  Category:Stars with proper names                 ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
