Glucosylceramidase

In enzymology, a glucosylceramidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + N-acylsphingosine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glucose and N-acylsphingosine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucosyl-N-acylsphingosine glucohydrolase. Other names in common use include:

psychosine hydrolase,
glucosphingosine glucosylhydrolase,
GlcCer-beta-glucosidase,
beta-D-glucocerebrosidase,
glucosylcerebrosidase,
beta-glucosylceramidase,
ceramide glucosidase,
glucocerebrosidase,
glucosylsphingosine beta-glucosidase,
and glucosylsphingosine beta-D-glucosidase.

This enzyme participates in sphingolipid metabolism and degradation of glycan structures.
