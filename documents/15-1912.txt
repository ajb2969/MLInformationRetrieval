Connection (affine bundle)

Let 
 
 
 
  be an affine bundle modelled over a vector bundle 
 
 
 
 . A connection

 
  on 
 
 
 
 
  is called the affine connection if it as a section 
 
 
 
  of the jet bundle

 
  of 
 
 
 
  is an affine bundle morphism over 
 
 
 
 . In particular, this is the case of an affine connection on the tangent bundle

 
 
  of a smooth manifold

 
 .
With respect to affine bundle coordinates 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , an affine connection 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 
  is given by the tangent-valued connection form



An affine bundle is a fiber bundle with a general affine structure group

 
  of affine transformations of its typical fiber 
 
 
 
  of dimension 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, an affine connection is associated to a principal connection. It always exists.
For any affine connection 
 
 
 
 , the corresponding linear derivative

 
  of an affine morphism 
 
 
 
  defines a unique linear connection on a vector bundle 
 
 
 
 . With respect to linear bundle coordinates 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , this connection reads



Since every vector bundle is an affine bundle, any linear connection on a vector bundle also is an affine connection.
If 
 
 
 
  is a vector bundle, both an affine connection 
 
 
 
  and an associated linear connection 
 
 
 
  are connections on the same vector bundle 
 
 
 
 , and their difference is a basic soldering form on 
 
 
 
 . Thus, every affine connection on a vector bundle 
 
 
 
  is a sum of a linear connection and a basic soldering form on 
 
 
 
 .
It should be noted that, due to the canonical vertical splitting 
 
 
 
 , this soldering form is brought into a vector-valued form

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a fiber basis for 
 
 
 
 .
Given an affine connection 
 
 
 
  on a vector bundle 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the curvatures of a connection 
 
 
 
  and the associated linear connection 
 
 
 
 , respectively. It is readily observed that 
 
 
 
 , where



is the torsion of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the basic soldering form 
 
 
 
 .
In particular, let us consider the tangent bundle 
 
 
 
  of a manifold 
 
 
 
  coordinated by 
 
 
 
 . There is the canonical soldering form 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  which coincides with the tautological one-form

 
  on 
 
 
 
  due to the canonical vertical splitting 
 
 
 
 . Given an arbitrary linear connection 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , the corresponding affine connection



on 
 
 
 
  is the Cartan connection. The torsion of the Cartan connection 
 
 
 
  with respect to the soldering form 
 
 
 
  coincides with the torsion of a linear connection 
 
 
 
 , and its curvature is a sum 
 
 
 
  of the curvature and the torsion of 
 
 
 
 .
