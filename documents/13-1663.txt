   P-derivation      P-derivation   In mathematics , more specifically differential algebra , a p -derivation (for p a prime number) on a ring  R , is a mapping from R to R that satisfies certain conditions outlined directly below. The notion of a p -derivation is related to that of a derivation in differential algebra.  Definition  Let p be a prime number. A p -derivation or Buium derivative on a ring   R   R   R   is a map of sets    δ  :   R  →  R      normal-:  δ   normal-→  R  R     \delta:R\to R   that satisfies the following " product rule ":        δ  p    (   a  b   )    =     δ  p    (  a  )    b  p    +    a  p    δ  p    (  b  )    +   p   δ  p    (  a  )    δ  p    (  b  )            subscript  δ  p     a  b         subscript  δ  p   a   superscript  b  p       superscript  a  p    subscript  δ  p   b     p   subscript  δ  p   a   subscript  δ  p   b      \delta_{p}(ab)=\delta_{p}(a)b^{p}+a^{p}\delta_{p}(b)+p\delta_{p}(a)\delta_{p}(b)     and "sum rule":        δ  p    (   a  +  b   )    =     δ  p    (  a  )    +    δ  p    (  b  )    +      a  p   +   b  p    -    (   a  +  b   )   p    p           subscript  δ  p     a  b         subscript  δ  p   a      subscript  δ  p   b          superscript  a  p    superscript  b  p     superscript    a  b   p    p      \delta_{p}(a+b)=\delta_{p}(a)+\delta_{p}(b)+\frac{a^{p}+b^{p}-(a+b)^{p}}{p}   .  as well as        δ  p    (  1  )    =  0         subscript  δ  p   1   0    \delta_{p}(1)=0   .  Note that in the "sum rule" we are not really dividing by p , since all the relevant binomial coefficients in the numerator are divisible by p , so this definition applies in the case when   R   R   R   has p - torsion .  Relation to Frobenius Endomorphisms  A map    σ  :   R  →  R      normal-:  σ   normal-→  R  R     \sigma:R\to R   is a lift of the Frobenius endomorphism provided     σ   (  x  )    =    x  p   mod   p  R          σ  x    modulo   superscript  x  p     p  R      \sigma(x)=x^{p}\mod pR   . An example such lift could come from the Artin map .  If    (  R  ,  δ  )     R  δ    (R,\delta)   is a ring with a p -derivation, then the map     σ   (  x  )    :=    x  p   +   p  δ   (  x  )        assign    σ  x      superscript  x  p     p  δ  x      \sigma(x):=x^{p}+p\delta(x)   defines a ring endomorphism which is a lift of the frobenius endomorphism. When the ring R is p -torsion free the correspondence is a bijection.  Examples   For    R  =  ℤ      R  ℤ    R=\mathbb{Z}   the unique p -derivation is the map         δ   (  x  )    =    x  -   x  p    p    .        δ  x       x   superscript  x  p    p     \delta(x)=\frac{x-x^{p}}{p}.   The quotient is well-defined because of Fermat's Little Theorem .   If R is any p -torsion free ring and    σ  :   R  →  R      normal-:  σ   normal-→  R  R     \sigma:R\to R   is a lift of the Frobenius endomorphism then        δ   (  x  )    =     σ   (  x  )    -   x  p    p         δ  x         σ  x    superscript  x  p    p     \delta(x)=\frac{\sigma(x)-x^{p}}{p}   defines a p -derivation.
