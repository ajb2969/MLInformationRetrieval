P-derivation

In mathematics, more specifically differential algebra, a p-derivation (for p a prime number) on a ring R, is a mapping from R to R that satisfies certain conditions outlined directly below. The notion of a p-derivation is related to that of a derivation in differential algebra.
Definition
Let p be a prime number. A p-derivation or Buium derivative on a ring 
 
 
 
  is a map of sets 
 
 
 
  that satisfies the following "product rule":



and "sum rule":


 
 .
as well as


 
 .
Note that in the "sum rule" we are not really dividing by p, since all the relevant binomial coefficients in the numerator are divisible by p, so this definition applies in the case when 
 
 
 
  has p-torsion.
Relation to Frobenius Endomorphisms
A map 
 
 
 
  is a lift of the Frobenius endomorphism provided 
 
 
 
 . An example such lift could come from the Artin map.
If 
 
 
 
 
  is a ring with a p-derivation, then the map 
 
 
 
  defines a ring endomorphism which is a lift of the frobenius endomorphism. When the ring R is p-torsion free the correspondence is a bijection.
Examples

For 
 
 
 
  the unique p-derivation is the map



 
  The quotient is well-defined because of Fermat's Little Theorem.

If R is any p-torsion free ring and 
 
 
 
  is a lift of the Frobenius endomorphism then



 
  defines a p-derivation.
