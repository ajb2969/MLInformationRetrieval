   2,5-didehydrogluconate reductase      2,5-didehydrogluconate reductase   In enzymology , a 2,5-didehydrogluconate reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-dehydro-D-gluconate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,5-didehydro-D-gluconate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-dehydro-D-gluconate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 2,5-didehydro-D-gluconate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-dehydro-D-gluconate:NADP + 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 2,5-diketo-D-gluconate reductase , and YqhE reductase .
