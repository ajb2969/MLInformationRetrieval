   Phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase      Phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase   In enzymology , a phosphoinositide 5-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4,5-bisphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol 4-phosphate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphatidyl-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate 4-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include type II inositol polyphosphate 5-phosphatase , triphosphoinositide phosphatase , IP3 phosphatase , PtdIns(4,5)P2 phosphatase , triphosphoinositide phosphomonoesterase , diphosphoinositide phosphatase , inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase , inositol triphosphate 5-phosphomonoesterase , phosphatidylinositol-bisphosphatase , phosphatidyl-myo-inositol-4,5-bisphosphate phosphatase , phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate phosphatase , polyphosphoinositol lipid 5-phosphatase , and phosphatidyl-inositol-bisphosphate phosphatase . This enzyme participates in inositol phosphate metabolism and phosphatidylinositol signaling system .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .  References     Cockcroft, S.
