Free Poisson distribution

In the mathematics of free probability theory, the free Poisson distribution is a counterpart of the Poisson distribution in conventional probability theory.
Definition
The free Poisson distribution1 with jump size 
 
 
 
  and rate 
 
 
 
  arises in free probability theory as the limit of repeated free convolution



as N → ∞.
In other words, let 
 
 
 
  be random variables so that 
 
 
 
  has value 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
  and value 0 with the remaining probability. Assume also that the family 
 
 
 
  are freely independent. Then the limit as 
 
 
 
  of the law of 
 
 
 
  is given by the Free Poisson law with parameters 
 
 
 
 .
This definition is analogous to one of the ways in which the classical Poisson distribution is obtained from a (classical) Poisson process.
The measure associated to the free Poisson law is given by



where



and has support 
 
 
 
 .
This law also arises in random matrix theory as the Marchenko–Pastur law. Its free cumulants are all equal to 
 
 
 
 .
Some transforms of this law
We give values of some important transforms of the free Poisson law; the computation can be found in e.g. in the book Lectures on the Combinatorics of Free Probability by A. Nica and R. Speicher2
The R-transform of the free Poisson law is given by



The Stieltjes transformation (also known as the Cauchy transform) is given by



The S-transform is given by



in the case that
