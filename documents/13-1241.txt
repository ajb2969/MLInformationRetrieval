   Free Poisson distribution      Free Poisson distribution   In the mathematics of free probability theory, the free Poisson distribution is a counterpart of the Poisson distribution in conventional probability theory.  Definition  The free Poisson distribution 1 with jump size   α   α   \alpha   and rate   λ   λ   \lambda   arises in free probability theory as the limit of repeated free convolution       (     (   1  -   λ  N    )    δ  0    +    λ  N    δ  α     )    ⊞  N      superscript        1    λ  N     subscript  δ  0        λ  N    subscript  δ  α      normal-⊞  N     \left(\left(1-\frac{\lambda}{N}\right)\delta_{0}+\frac{\lambda}{N}\delta_{%
 \alpha}\right)^{\boxplus N}     as N → ∞.  In other words, let    X  N     subscript  X  N    X_{N}   be random variables so that    X  N     subscript  X  N    X_{N}   has value   α   α   \alpha   with probability    λ  N      λ  N    \frac{\lambda}{N}   and value 0 with the remaining probability. Assume also that the family     X  1   ,   X  2   ,  …      subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2   normal-…    X_{1},X_{2},\ldots   are freely independent . Then the limit as    N  →  ∞     normal-→  N     N\to\infty   of the law of     X  1   +  ⋯  +   X  N        subscript  X  1   normal-⋯   subscript  X  N     X_{1}+\cdots+X_{N}   is given by the Free Poisson law with parameters    λ  ,  α     λ  α    \lambda,\alpha   .  This definition is analogous to one of the ways in which the classical Poisson distribution is obtained from a (classical) Poisson process.  The measure associated to the free Poisson law is given by      μ  =   {         (   1  -  λ   )    δ  0    +   λ  ν    ,       if  0   ≤  λ  ≤  1        ν  ,        if  λ   >  1   ,           μ   cases        1  λ    subscript  δ  0      λ  ν          if  0   λ       1    ν      if  λ   1      \mu=\begin{cases}(1-\lambda)\delta_{0}+\lambda\nu,&\text{if }0\leq\lambda\leq 1%
 \\
 \nu,&\text{if }\lambda>1,\end{cases}     where      ν  =    1   2  π  α  t        4  λ   α  2    -    (   t  -   α   (   1  +  λ   )     )   2      d  t       ν      1    2  π  α  t          4  λ   superscript  α  2     superscript    t    α    1  λ     2     d  t     \nu=\frac{1}{2\pi\alpha t}\sqrt{4\lambda\alpha^{2}-(t-\alpha(1+\lambda))^{2}}%
 \,dt     and has support    [   α    (   1  -   λ    )   2    ,   α    (   1  +   λ    )   2    ]       α   superscript    1    λ    2      α   superscript    1    λ    2      [\alpha(1-\sqrt{\lambda})^{2},\alpha(1+\sqrt{\lambda})^{2}]   .  This law also arises in random matrix theory as the Marchenko–Pastur law . Its free cumulants are all equal to   λ   λ   \lambda   .  Some transforms of this law  We give values of some important transforms of the free Poisson law; the computation can be found in e.g. in the book Lectures on the Combinatorics of Free Probability by A. Nica and R. Speicher 2  The R-transform of the free Poisson law is given by        R   (  z  )    =    λ  α    1  -   α  z      .        R  z       λ  α     1    α  z       R(z)=\frac{\lambda\alpha}{1-\alpha z}.     The Stieltjes transformation (also known as the Cauchy transform) is given by       G   (  z  )    =     z  +  α   -   λ  α   -      (   z  -   α   (   1  +  λ   )     )   2   -   4  λ   α  2        2  α  z          G  z         z  α     λ  α        superscript    z    α    1  λ     2     4  λ   superscript  α  2         2  α  z      G(z)=\frac{z+\alpha-\lambda\alpha-\sqrt{(z-\alpha(1+\lambda))^{2}-4\lambda%
 \alpha^{2}}}{2\alpha z}     The S-transform is given by       S   (  z  )    =   1   z  +  λ          S  z     1    z  λ      S(z)=\frac{1}{z+\lambda}     in the case that    α  =  1      α  1    \alpha=1   .
