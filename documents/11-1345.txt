   Phenol beta-glucosyltransferase      Phenol beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a phenol beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + a phenol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + an aryl beta-D-glucoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and phenol , whereas its two products are UDP and aryl beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:phenol beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDPglucosyltransferase , phenol-beta-D-glucosyltransferase , UDP glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose glucosyltransferase , and uridine diphosphoglucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
