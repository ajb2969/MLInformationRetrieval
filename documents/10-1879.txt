   Saint-Venant's theorem      Saint-Venant's theorem   In solid mechanics , it is common to analyze the properties of beams with constant cross section. Saint-Venant's theorem states that the simply connected cross section with maximal torsional  rigidity is a circle. 1 It is named after the French mathematician Adhémar Jean Claude Barré de Saint-Venant .  Given a simply connected domain D in the plane with area A ,   ρ   ρ   \rho   the radius and   σ   σ   \sigma   the area of its greatest inscribed circle, the torsional rigidity P of D is defined by       P  =   4    sup  f      (   ∫    ∫  D     f   d   x   d  y     )   2     ∫    ∫  D    f  x  2     +     f  y  2    d   x   d  y        .      P    4    subscript  supremum  f      superscript      subscript   D     f  d  x  d  y     2         subscript   D    superscript   subscript  f  x   2        superscript   subscript  f  y   2   d  x  d  y         P=4\sup_{f}\frac{\left(\int\int\limits_{D}f\,dx\,dy\right)^{2}}{\int\int%
 \limits_{D}f_{x}^{2}+f_{y}^{2}\,dx\,dy}.     Here the supremum is taken over all the continuously differentiable functions vanishing on the boundary of D . The existence of this supremum is a consequence of Poincaré inequality .  Saint-Venant 2 conjectured in 1856 that of all domains D of equal area A the circular one has the greatest torsional rigidity, that is       P  ≤   P  circle   ≤    A  2    2  π     .        P   subscript  P  circle           superscript  A  2     2  π       P\leq P_{\text{circle}}\leq\frac{A^{2}}{2\pi}.     A rigorous proof of this inequality was not given until 1948 by Pólya . 3 Another proof was given by Davenport and reported in. 4 A more general proof and an estimate      P  <   4   ρ  2   A       P    4   superscript  ρ  2   A     P<4\rho^{2}A     is given by Makai. 5  Notes    "  Category:Elasticity (physics)  Category:Calculus of variations  Category:Inequalities  Category:Physics theorems     E.
