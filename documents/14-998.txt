Sanov's theorem

In information theory, Sanov's theorem gives a bound on the probability of observing an atypical sequence of samples from a given probability distribution.
Let A be a set of probability distributions over an alphabet X, and let q be an arbitrary distribution over X (where q may or may not be in A). Suppose we draw n i.i.d. samples from q, represented by the vector 
 
 
 
 . Further, let us ask that the empirical distribution, 
 
 
 
 , of the samples falls within the set A—formally, we write 
 
 
 
 . Then,


 
 ,
where



 
  is shorthand for 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  is the information projection of q onto A.

In words, the probability of drawing an atypical distribution is proportional to the KL distance from the true distribution to the atypical one; in the case that we consider a set of possible atypical distributions, there is a dominant atypical distribution, given by the information projection.
Furthermore, if A is a closed set,
