   Difference hierarchy      Difference hierarchy   In set theory , the difference hierarchy over a pointclass is a hierarchy of larger pointclasses generated by taking differences of sets. If Γ is a pointclass, then the set of differences in Γ is    {  A  :  ∃  C  ,  D  ∈  Γ   (  A  =  C  ∖  D  )   }     fragments  normal-{  A  normal-:   C  normal-,  D   Γ   fragments  normal-(  A   C   D  normal-)   normal-}    \{A:\exists C,D\in\Gamma(A=C\setminus D)\}   . In usual notation, this set is denoted by 2-Γ. The next level of the hierarchy is denoted by 3-Γ and consists of differences of three sets:    {  A  :  ∃  C  ,  D  ,  E  ∈  Γ   (  A  =  C  ∖   (  D  ∖  E  )   )   }     fragments  normal-{  A  normal-:   C  normal-,  D  normal-,  E   Γ   fragments  normal-(  A   C    fragments  normal-(  D   E  normal-)   normal-)   normal-}    \{A:\exists C,D,E\in\Gamma(A=C\setminus(D\setminus E))\}   . This definition can be extended recursively into the transfinite to α-Γ for some ordinal α. 1  In the Borel and projective hierarchies , Felix Hausdorff proved that the countable levels of the difference hierarchy over Π 0 γ and Π 1 γ give Δ 0 γ+1 and Δ 1 γ+1 , respectively. 2  References  "  Category:Descriptive set theory  Category:Mathematical logic hierarchies     . ↩  .
