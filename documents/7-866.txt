Difference hierarchy

In set theory, the difference hierarchy over a pointclass is a hierarchy of larger pointclasses generated by taking differences of sets. If Γ is a pointclass, then the set of differences in Γ is 
 
 
 
 . In usual notation, this set is denoted by 2-Γ. The next level of the hierarchy is denoted by 3-Γ and consists of differences of three sets: 
 
 
 
 . This definition can be extended recursively into the transfinite to α-Γ for some ordinal α.1
In the Borel and projective hierarchies, Felix Hausdorff proved that the countable levels of the difference hierarchy over Π0γ and Π1γ give Δ0γ+1 and Δ1γ+1, respectively.2
