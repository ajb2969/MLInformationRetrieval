   Cetraxate benzylesterase      Cetraxate benzylesterase   In enzymology , a cetraxate benzylesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cetraxate benzyl ester + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cetraxate + benzyl alcohol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cetraxate benzyl ester and H 2 O , whereas its two products are cetraxate and benzyl alcohol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cetraxate-benzyl-ester benzylhydrolase .
