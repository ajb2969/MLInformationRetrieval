   Elimination rate constant      Elimination rate constant   The elimination rate constant  K is a value used in pharmacokinetics to describe the rate at which a drug is removed from the system. 1  It is often abbreviated K or K e . It is equivalent to the fraction of a substance that is removed per unit time measured at any particular instant and has units of T −1 . This can be expressed mathematically with the differential equation       C   t  +   d  t     =    C  t   -     C  t   ⋅  K  ⋅  d   t         subscript  C    t    d  t        subscript  C  t      normal-⋅   subscript  C  t   K  d   t      C_{t+dt}=C_{t}-C_{t}\cdot K\cdot dt   , where    C  t     subscript  C  t    C_{t}   is the blood plasma concentration of drug in the system at a given point in time   t   t   t   ,    d  t      d  t    dt   is an infinitely small change in time, and    C   t  +   d  t       subscript  C    t    d  t      C_{t+dt}   is the concentration of drug in the system after the infinitely small change in time.  The solution of this differential equation is useful in calculating the concentration after the administration of a single dose of drug via IV bolus injection:       C  t   =    C  0   ⋅    e   -   K  t            subscript  C  t    normal-⋅   subscript  C  0    superscript  e      K  t        C_{t}=C_{0}\cdot e^{-Kt}\,      C t is concentration after time t  C 0 is the initial concentration ( t =0)  K is the elimination rate constant   Sample values and equations  References  "  Category:Pharmacokinetics     ↩
