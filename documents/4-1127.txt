Hotelling's T-squared distribution




Hotelling's T-squared distribution

In statistics Hotelling's T-squared distribution is a univariate distribution proportional to the F-distribution and arises importantly as the distribution of a set of statistics which are natural generalizations of the statistics underlying Student's t-distribution. In particular, the distribution arises in multivariate statistics in undertaking tests of the differences between the (multivariate) means of different populations, where tests for univariate problems would make use of a t-test.
The distribution is named for Harold Hotelling, who developed it1 as a generalization of Student's t-distribution.
The distribution
If the vector pd1 is Gaussian multivariate-distributed with zero mean and unit covariance matrix N(p01,pIp) and mMp is a p x p matrix with a Wishart distribution with unit scale matrix and m degrees of freedom W(pIp,m) then m(1'd' pM−1pd'1) has a Hotelling T2 distribution with dimensionality parameter p and m degrees of freedom.2
If the notation 
 
 
 
  is used to denote a random variable having Hotelling's T-squared distribution with parameters p and m then, if a random variable X has Hotelling's T-squared distribution,


 
  then3


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the F-distribution with parameters p and m−p+1.
Hotelling's T-squared statistic
Hotelling's T-squared statistic is a generalization of Student's t statistic that is used in multivariate hypothesis testing, and is defined as follows.4
Let 
 
 
 
  denote a p-variate normal distribution with location

 
  and covariance

 
 
 . Let



be n independent random variables, which may be represented as 
 
 
 
  column vectors of real numbers. Define



to be the sample mean. It can be shown that



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the chi-squared distribution with p degrees of freedom. To show this use the fact that 
 
 
 
  and then derive the characteristic function of the random variable 
 
 
 
 . This is done below,


























However, 
 
 
 
 
  is often unknown and we wish to do hypothesis testing on the location 
 
 
 
 .
Sum of p squared t's
Define



to be the sample covariance. Here we denote transpose by an apostrophe. It can be shown that 
 
 
 
  is positive-definite and 
 
 
 
  follows a p-variate Wishart distribution with n−1 degrees of freedom.5 Hotelling's T-squared statistic is then defined6 to be



and, also from above,



i.e.



where 
 
 
 
  is the F-distribution with parameters p and n−p. In order to calculate a p value, multiply the t2 statistic by the above constant and use the F-distribution.
Hotelling's two-sample T-squared statistic
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , with the samples independently drawn from two independent multivariate normal distributions with the same mean and covariance, and we define


 
  as the sample means, and


 
  as the unbiased pooled covariance matrix estimate, then Hotelling's two-sample T-squared statistic is



and it can be related to the F-distribution by7



The non-null distribution of this statistic is the noncentral F-distribution (the ratio of a non-central Chi-squared random variable and an independent central Chi-squared random variable)


 
  with


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the difference vector between the population means.
More robust and powerful tests than Hotelling's two-sample test have been proposed in the literature, see for example the interpont distance based tests which can be applied also when the number of variables is comparable with, or even larger than, the number of subjects.89
In the two variable case, the formula simplifies nicely allowing appreciation of how the correlation, 
 
 
 
 , between the variables affects 
 
 
 
 . If we define


 
  and


 
  then


 
  Thus, if the differences in the two rows of the vector 
 
 
 
  are of the same sign, in general, 
 
 
 
  becomes smaller as 
 
 
 
  becomes more positive. If the differences are of opposite sign 
 
 
 
  becomes larger as 
 
 
 
  becomes more positive.
