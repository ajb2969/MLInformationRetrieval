Power residue symbol

In algebraic number theory the n-th power residue symbol (for an integer n > 2) is a generalization of the (quadratic) Legendre symbol to n-th powers. These symbols are used in the statement and proof of cubic, quartic, Eisenstein, and related higher1 reciprocity laws.2
Background and notation
Let k be an algebraic number field with ring of integers   
 
 
 
   that contains a primitive n-th root of unity   
 
 

Let   
 
 
 
    be a prime ideal and assume that n and 
 
 
 
  are coprime (i.e. 
 
 
 
 .)
The norm of  
 
 
 
   is defined as the cardinality of the residue class ring   
 
 
 
    (since 
 
 
 
  is prime this is a finite field)
There is an analogue of Fermat's theorem in   
 
 
 
   If   
 
 
 
    then



And finally,   
 
 
 
    These facts imply that


 
    is well-defined and congruent to a unique n-th root of unity ζns.
Definition
This root of unity is called the n-th power residue symbol for   
 
 
   and is denoted by



Properties
The n-th power symbol has properties completely analogous to those of the classical (quadratic) Legendre symbol:



In all cases (zero and nonzero)









Relation to the Hilbert symbol
The n-th power residue symbol is related to the Hilbert symbol

 
  for the prime 
 
 
 
  by



in the case 
 
 
 
  coprime to n, where 
 
 
 
  is any uniformising element for the local field

Generalizations
The n-th power symbol may be extended to take non-prime ideals or non-zero elements as its "denominator", in the same way that the Jacobi symbol extends the Legendre symbol.
Any ideal 
 
 
 
  is the product of prime ideals, and in one way only:



The n-th power symbol is extended multiplicatively:



If 
 
 
 
  is not zero the symbol 
 
 
 
  is defined as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the principal ideal generated by 
 
 

\mbox{ then } \bigg(\frac{\alpha}{\mathfrak{a} }\bigg)_n = \left(\frac{\beta}{\mathfrak{a} }\right)_n.

 }}
\mbox{ then } \left(\frac{\alpha}{\mathfrak{a} }\right)_n =1.

Power reciprocity law
The power reciprocity law, the analogue of the law of quadratic reciprocity, may be formulated in terms of the Hilbert symbols as4


 
 , whenever 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are coprime.
