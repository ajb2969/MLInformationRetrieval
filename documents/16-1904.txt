   Positive real numbers      Positive real numbers   In mathematics , the set of positive real numbers ,     ℝ    >  0    =   {   x  ∈  ℝ   ∣   x  >  0   }        subscript  ℝ    absent  0     conditional-set    x  ℝ     x  0      \mathbb{R}_{>0}=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x>0\right\}   , is the subset of those real numbers that are greather than zero.  Notation  Alternative to    ℝ    >  0      subscript  ℝ    absent  0     \mathbb{R}_{>0}   , the non-standard symbols    ℝ  +     subscript  ℝ     \mathbb{R}_{+}   and    ℝ  +     superscript  ℝ     \mathbb{R}^{+}   are often used. However, this may lead to confusion, as some authors use them to denote the set of non-negative real numbers ,     ℝ    ≥  0    =   {   x  ∈  ℝ   ∣   x  ≥  0   }        subscript  ℝ    absent  0     conditional-set    x  ℝ     x  0      \mathbb{R}_{\geq 0}=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}\mid x\geq 0\right\}   , which explicitly includes zero. The non-negative reals serve as the range for metrics , norms and measures in mathematics.  Properties  The set    ℝ    >  0      subscript  ℝ    absent  0     \mathbb{R}_{>0}   is closed under addition, multiplication, and division. It inherits a topology from the real line and, thus, has the structure of a multiplicative topological group or of an additive topological semigroup .       ℝ    >  0    =    (  0  ,  1  )   ∪   {  1  }   ∪   (  1  ,  ∞  )         subscript  ℝ    absent  0       0  1    1    1       \mathbb{R}_{>0}=(0,1)\cup\{1\}\cup(1,\infty)   and the multiplicative inverse function exchanges the intervals. The functions floor ,    floor  :     [  1  ,  ∞  )   →  ℕ   ,   x  ↦   ⌊  x  ⌋        normal-:  floor   formulae-sequence   normal-→   1    ℕ    maps-to  x    x       \operatorname{floor}:[1,\infty)\to\mathbb{N},\,x\mapsto\lfloor x\rfloor   , and excess ,    excess  :     [  1  ,  ∞  )   →   (  0  ,  1  )    ,   x  ↦   x  -   ⌊  x  ⌋         normal-:  excess   formulae-sequence   normal-→   1     0  1     maps-to  x    x    x        \operatorname{excess}:[1,\infty)\to(0,1),\,x\mapsto x-\lfloor x\rfloor   , have been used to describe an element    x  ∈   ℝ    >  0        x   subscript  ℝ    absent  0      x\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}   as a continued fraction     [   n  1   ;   n  2   ,   n  3   ,  …  ]      subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2    subscript  n  3   normal-…    [n_{1};n_{2},n_{3},\ldots]   which is a sequence of integers obtained from the floor function after the excess has been reciprocated. For    x  ∈  ℚ      x  ℚ    x\in\mathbb{Q}   the sequence terminates with an exact fractional expression of   x   x   x   , and for quadratic irrational    x   x   x   the sequence becomes a periodic continued fraction .  In a complex plane ,    ℝ    >  0      subscript  ℝ    absent  0     \mathbb{R}_{>0}   is identified with the positive real axis and is usually drawn as a horizontal ray . This ray is used as reference in the polar form of a complex number . The real positive axis corresponds to complex numbers     z  =    |  z  |    e   i  φ         z      z    superscript  normal-e    normal-i  φ       z=|z|\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}\varphi}   with argument     φ  =  0      φ  0    \varphi=0   .  In the study of classical groups , for every    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   , there is a normal subgroup relation SL( n ,ℝ ◁ GL( n ,ℝ), the general linear group , such that the quotient group is the positive real numbers. In this context    ℝ    >  0      subscript  ℝ    absent  0     \mathbb{R}_{>0}   is considered to be a Lie group .  Logarithmic measure  If     [  a  ,  b  ]   ⊆   R    >  0         a  b    subscript  normal-R    absent  0      [a,b]\subseteq\mathrm{R}_{>0}   is an interval , then     μ   (   [  a  ,  b  ]   )    =   log   (   b  /  a   )          μ   a  b        b  a      \mu([a,b])=\log(b/a)   determines a measure on certain subsets of    ℝ    >  0      subscript  ℝ    absent  0     \mathbb{R}_{>0}   . In fact, it is an invariant measure with respect to multiplication     [  a  ,  b  ]   →   [   a  z   ,   b  z   ]      normal-→   a  b      a  z     b  z      [a,b]\to[az,bz]   by a    z  ∈   ℝ    >  0        z   subscript  ℝ    absent  0      z\in\mathbb{R}_{>0}   . In the context of topological groups, this measure is an example of a Haar measure .  The utility of this measure is shown in its use for describing stellar magnitudes and noise levels in decibels , among other applications of the logarithmic scale . For purposes of international standards ISO 80000-3 the dimensionless quantities are referred to as level (logarithmic quantity) .
