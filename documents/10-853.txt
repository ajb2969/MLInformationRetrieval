TRNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a tRNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + tRNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tRNA containing 5-methylcytosine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and tRNA, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tRNA containing 5-methylcytosine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytosine-5-)-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include transfer ribonucleate cytosine 5-methyltransferase, and transfer RNA cytosine 5-methyltransferase.
