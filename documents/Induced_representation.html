<h1>Induced representation</h1>
<hr/>
<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, and in particular <a href="group_representation" title="wikilink">group representation</a> theory, the <strong>induced representation</strong> is one of the major general operations for passing from a representation of a <a class="uri" href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroup</a> <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> to a representation of the (whole) <a href="group_(mathematics)" title="wikilink"> group</a> <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> itself. It was initially defined as a construction by <a href="Ferdinand_Georg_Frobenius" title="wikilink">Frobenius</a>, for <a href="linear_representation" title="wikilink">linear representations</a> of <a href="finite_group" title="wikilink">finite groups</a>. It includes as special cases the action of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> on the cosets <span class="LaTeX">$G / H$</span> by permutation, which is the case of the induced representation starting with the trivial one-dimensional representation of <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>. If  this becomes the <a href="regular_representation" title="wikilink">regular representation</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>. Therefore induced representations are rich objects, in the sense that they include or detect many interesting representations. The idea is by no means limited to the case of finite groups, but the theory in that case is particularly well-behaved.</p>
<h2 id="alternate-formulations">Alternate formulations</h2>
<p>The central theorem in the finite group case is the <strong>Frobenius reciprocity theorem</strong>. It is stated in terms of another construction of representations, the <em>restriction map</em> (which is a <a class="uri" href="functor" title="wikilink">functor</a>): any linear representation of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>, as a <span class="LaTeX">$K G G$</span>-<a href="module_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">module</a> where <span class="LaTeX">$K G G$</span> is the <a href="group_ring" title="wikilink">group ring</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> over a field <span class="LaTeX">$K$</span>, is also a <span class="LaTeX">$K H H$</span>-module. The theorem states that, given representations <span class="LaTeX">$ρ$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$σ$</span> of <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>, the space of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>-<a class="uri" href="equivariant" title="wikilink">equivariant</a> linear maps from <span class="LaTeX">$ρ$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$Ind( σ )$</span> has the same dimension as that of the <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>-equivariant linear maps from <span class="LaTeX">$Res( ρ )$</span> to <span class="LaTeX">$σ$</span>. (Here Res stands for <a href="restricted_representation" title="wikilink">restricted representation</a>, and Ind for induced representation.) It is useful (in the typical case of non-modular representations, anyway - say with <span class="LaTeX">$K = \mathbf{ C } $</span>) for computing the decomposition of the induced representation: we can do calculations on the side of <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>, which is the 'small' group.</p>
<p>The <strong>Frobenius formula</strong> states that if <span class="LaTeX">$χ$</span> is the character of the representation <span class="LaTeX">$σ$</span>, given by <span class="LaTeX">$χ ( h ) = Tr σ ( h )$</span>, then the character <span class="LaTeX">$ψ$</span> of the induced representation is given by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\psi(g) = \sum_{x\in G / H} \widehat{\chi}\left(x^{-1}gx \right),$$</span></p>
<p>where</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\widehat{\chi} (g) = \begin{cases} \chi(g) & g \in H \\ 0 & \text{otherwise}\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>Frobenius reciprocity shows that Res and Ind are <a href="adjoint_functor" title="wikilink">adjoint functors</a>. More precisely, Ind is the left adjoint to Res. But in the finite group case, it is also a right adjoint, so (Res, Ind) is a <a href="Frobenius_pair" title="wikilink">Frobenius pair</a>. The content of that statement is more than the dimensions: it requires that the isomorphism of vector spaces of intertwining maps be <em>natural</em>, in the sense of <a href="category_theory" title="wikilink">category theory</a>. It actually suggests that <strong>induced representation</strong> can in this case be defined by means of the adjunction. That's not the only way to do it - and perhaps not the only helpful way - but it means that the theory will not be <em><a href="ad_hoc" title="wikilink">ad hoc</a></em> in its start.</p>
<p>One can therefore make the reciprocity theorem the way to define the induced representation. There is another way, suggested by the permutation examples of the introductory paragraph. The induced representation <span class="LaTeX">$Ind( σ )$</span> should be realized as a space of functions on <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> transforming under <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> according to the representation <span class="LaTeX">$σ$</span>. Therefore if <span class="LaTeX">$σ$</span> acts on the <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector space</a> <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>, we should look at <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>-valued functions on <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> on which <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> acts <em>via</em> <span class="LaTeX">$σ$</span> (this must be said carefully with explicit talk about left- and right-actions; see below). This approach allows the induced representation to be a kind of <a href="free_module" title="wikilink">free module</a> construction.</p>
<p>The two approaches outlined above can be reconciled in the case of finite groups, by using the <a href="tensor_product" title="wikilink">tensor product</a> with <span class="LaTeX">$K G G$</span> as a <span class="LaTeX">$K H H$</span>-module. There is a third and classical approach, of simply writing down the <a href="character_(group_theory)" title="wikilink">character</a> (trace) of the induced representation, in terms of conjugation in <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> of elements <span class="LaTeX">$g$</span> into <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>.</p>
<p>The reciprocity formula can sometimes be generalized to more general topological groups; for example, the <a href="Selberg_trace_formula" title="wikilink">Selberg trace formula</a> and the <a href="Arthur-Selberg_trace_formula" title="wikilink">Arthur-Selberg trace formula</a> are generalizations of Frobenius reciprocity to discrete cofinite subgroups of certain locally compact groups.</p>
<h2 id="construction">Construction</h2>
<h3 id="algebraic">Algebraic</h3>
<p>Let <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> be a finite group and <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> any subgroup of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>. Furthermore let <span class="LaTeX">$( π , V )$</span> be a representation of <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>. Let <span class="LaTeX">$n = G G : H$</span> be the <a href="Index_of_a_subgroup" title="wikilink">index</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> in <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> and let <mtpl></mtpl> be a full set of representatives in <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> of the cosets in <span class="LaTeX">$G / H$</span>. The induced representation <span class="LaTeX">$Ind  π$</span> can be thought of as acting on the following space:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$W=\bigoplus_{i=1}^n x_i V.$$</span></p>
<p>Here each <mtpl></mtpl> is an <a class="uri" href="isomorphic" title="wikilink">isomorphic</a> copy of the vector space <em>V</em>. For each <em>g</em> in <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> and each <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> there is an <em>h</em> = <em>h<sub>i</sub></em> in <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> and <em>j</em> = <em>j</em>(<em>i</em>) in {1, ..., <em>n</em>} such that <em>gx<sub>i</sub></em> = <em>x<sub>j</sub>h</em>. This is just another way of saying that <mtpl></mtpl> is a full set of representatives. Via the induced representation <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> acts on <span class="LaTeX">$W$</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$g\cdot\sum_{i=1}^n x_i v_i=\sum_{i=1}^n x_{j(i)} \pi(h_i) v_i$$</span></p>
<p>where <span class="LaTeX">$v_i \in V$</span> for each <em>i</em>.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier this construction is equivalent to defining <mtpl> <em>K</em>[<em>G</em>] ⊗<sub><em>K</em>[<em>H</em>]</sub> <em>V</em>}}</mtpl>. This latter formula can also be used to define <span class="LaTeX">$Ind  π$</span> for any group <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> and subgroup <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span>, without requiring any finiteness.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="analytic">Analytic</h3>
<p>If <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> is a <a href="locally_compact" title="wikilink">locally compact</a> <a href="topological_group" title="wikilink">topological group</a> (possibly infinite) and <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> is a <a href="Closed_set" title="wikilink">closed</a> <a class="uri" href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroup</a> then there is a common analytic construction of the induced representation. Let <span class="LaTeX">$( π , V )$</span> be a <a href="continuous_function" title="wikilink">continuous</a> representation of <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> into a <a href="Hilbert_space" title="wikilink">Hilbert space</a> <em>V</em>. We can then let:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\operatorname{Ind}_H^G\pi= \left \{f:G \to V \ : \ f(hg)=\pi(h)f(g) \text{ and } f \in L^2(G) \right\}.$$</span></p>
<p>Here <mtpl></mtpl> is taken with respect to a <a href="Haar_measure" title="wikilink">Haar measure</a>. The group <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> acts on the induced representation space by right translation, that is, (<em>g</em>·<em>f</em>)(<em>x</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>xg</em>).</p>
<p>This construction is often modified in various ways to fit the applications needed. A common version is called <strong>normalized induction</strong> and usually uses the same notation. The definition of the representation space is as follows:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\operatorname{Ind}_H^G\pi= \left \{f : G \to V \ : \ f(hg)=\Delta_G^{-\frac{1}{2}}(h)\Delta_H^{\frac{1}{2}}(h)\pi(h)f(g) \text{ and } f\in L^2(G) \right \}.$$</span></p>
<p>Here <mtpl></mtpl> are the <a href="Haar_measure#The_modular_function" title="wikilink">modular functions</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> respectively. With the addition of the <em>normalizing</em> factors this induction <a class="uri" href="functor" title="wikilink">functor</a> takes <a href="unitary_representation" title="wikilink">unitary representations</a> to unitary representations.</p>
<p>One other variation on induction is called <strong>compact induction</strong>. This is just standard induction restricted to functions with <a href="compact_support" title="wikilink">compact support</a>. Formally it is denoted by ind and defined as:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\operatorname{ind}_H^G\pi= \left \{f:G \to V \ : \ f(hg)=\pi(h)f(g) \text{ and } f \text{ has compact support mod } H \right \}.$$</span></p>
<p>Note that if <span class="LaTeX">$G / H$</span> is compact then Ind and ind are the same functor.</p>
<h3 id="geometric">Geometric</h3>
<p>Suppose <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> is a <a href="topological_group" title="wikilink">topological group</a> and <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> is a <a href="Closed_set" title="wikilink">closed</a> <a class="uri" href="subgroup" title="wikilink">subgroup</a> of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>. Also, suppose <span class="LaTeX">$σ$</span> is a realization of <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> over the space <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>. The product <span class="LaTeX">$V × G$</span> is a realization of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> as follows:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$g'[(x,g)]=\left(x,gg'^{-1}\right)$$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$g$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$g ′$</span> are elements of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$x$</span> is an element of <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span>.</p>
<p>Define the <a href="equivalence_relation" title="wikilink">equivalence relation</a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$(x, g) \sim (h[x], hg).$$</span></p>
<p>Note that this equivalence relation is invariant under the action of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>. In other words, <span class="LaTeX">$V × G /~$</span> is a realization of <span class="LaTeX">$G$</span>,</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$g^{-1}hg[(x,g)]=(x,h^{-1}g)\sim(h[x],g).$$</span></p>
<p>In other words, <span class="LaTeX">$V × G /~$</span> is a <a href="fiber_bundle" title="wikilink">fiber bundle</a> over the <a href="Quotient_space_(topology)" title="wikilink">quotient space</a> <span class="LaTeX">$G / H$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$H$</span> as the <a href="structure_group" title="wikilink">structure group</a> and <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> as the fiber.</p>
<p>Now suppose <span class="LaTeX">$σ$</span> is a representation and <span class="LaTeX">$V$</span> is a vector space. The previous construction defines a vector bundle over <span class="LaTeX">$G / H$</span>. The space of sections of this vector bundle is the induced representation.</p>
<p>In the case of <a href="unitary_representation" title="wikilink">unitary representations</a> of locally compact groups, the induction construction can be formulated in terms of <a href="system_of_imprimitivity" title="wikilink">systems of imprimitivity</a>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<p>For any group, the induced representation of the <a href="trivial_representation" title="wikilink">trivial representation</a> of the <a href="trivial_subgroup" title="wikilink">trivial subgroup</a> is the right <a href="regular_representation" title="wikilink">regular representation</a>. More generally the induced representation of the <a href="trivial_representation" title="wikilink">trivial representation</a> of any subgroup is the permutation representation on the cosets of that subgroup.</p>
<p>An induced representation of a one dimensional representation is called a <strong>monomial representation</strong>, because it can be represented as <a href="monomial_matrix" title="wikilink">monomial matrices</a>. Some groups have the property that all of their irreducible representations are monomial, the so-called <a href="monomial_group" title="wikilink">monomial groups</a>.</p>
<p>In Lie theory, an extremely important example is <a href="parabolic_induction" title="wikilink">parabolic induction</a>: inducing representations of a <a href="reductive_group" title="wikilink">reductive group</a> from representations of its <a href="parabolic_subgroup" title="wikilink">parabolic subgroups</a>. This leads, via the <a href="philosophy_of_cusp_forms" title="wikilink">philosophy of cusp forms</a>, to the <a href="Langlands_program" title="wikilink">Langlands program</a>.</p>
