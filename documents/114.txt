   Cauchy index      Cauchy index   In mathematical analysis , the Cauchy index is an integer associated to a real rational function over an interval . By the Routh–Hurwitz theorem , we have the following interpretation: the Cauchy index of   r ( x ) = p ( x )/ q ( x )   over the real line is the difference between the number of roots of f ( z ) located in the right half-plane and those located in the left half-plane. The complex polynomial f ( z ) is such that   f ( iy ) = q ( y ) + ip ( y ).   We must also assume that p has degree less than the degree of q .  Definition   The Cauchy index was first defined for a pole s of the rational function r by Augustin Louis Cauchy in 1837 using one-sided limits as:         I  s   r   =   {       +  1   ,        if    lim   x  ↑  s     r   (  x  )      =    -   ∞    ∧    lim   x  ↓  s     r   (  x  )      =   +  ∞    ,         -  1   ,        if    lim   x  ↑  s     r   (  x  )      =    +   ∞    ∧    lim   x  ↓  s     r   (  x  )      =   -  ∞    ,        0  ,     otherwise.             subscript  I  s   r    cases    1         if    subscript    normal-↑  x  s      r  x             subscript    normal-↓  x  s      r  x                  1         if    subscript    normal-↑  x  s      r  x             subscript    normal-↓  x  s      r  x                0  otherwise.     I_{s}r=\begin{cases}+1,&\text{if }\displaystyle\lim_{x\uparrow s}r(x)=-\infty%
 \;\land\;\lim_{x\downarrow s}r(x)=+\infty,\\
 -1,&\text{if }\displaystyle\lim_{x\uparrow s}r(x)=+\infty\;\land\;\lim_{x%
 \downarrow s}r(x)=-\infty,\\
 0,&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}      A generalization over the compact interval [ a , b ] is direct (when neither a nor b are poles of r ( x )): it is the sum of the Cauchy indices    I  s     subscript  I  s    I_{s}   of r for each s located in the interval. We usually denote it by     I  a  b   r       superscript   subscript  I  a   b   r    I_{a}^{b}r   .    We can then generalize to intervals of type    [   -  ∞   ,   +  ∞   ]               [-\infty,+\infty]   since the number of poles of r is a finite number (by taking the limit of the Cauchy index over [ a , b ] for a and b going to infinity).   Examples  (Figure)  A rational function    Consider the rational function:         r   (  x  )    =     4   x  3    -   3  x       16   x  5    -   20   x  3     +   5  x     =    p   (  x  )     q   (  x  )      .          r  x         4   superscript  x  3      3  x          16   superscript  x  5      20   superscript  x  3       5  x              p  x     q  x       r(x)=\frac{4x^{3}-3x}{16x^{5}-20x^{3}+5x}=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}.   We recognize in p ( x ) and q ( x ) respectively the Chebyshev polynomials of degree 3 and 5. Therefore r ( x ) has poles     x  1   =  0.9511       subscript  x  1   0.9511    x_{1}=0.9511   ,     x  2   =  0.5878       subscript  x  2   0.5878    x_{2}=0.5878   ,     x  3   =  0       subscript  x  3   0    x_{3}=0   ,     x  4   =   -  0.5878        subscript  x  4     0.5878     x_{4}=-0.5878   and     x  5   =   -  0.9511        subscript  x  5     0.9511     x_{5}=-0.9511   , i.e.     x  j   =   cos   (      (    2  i   -  1   )   π   /  2   n   )         subscript  x  j               2  i   1   π   2   n      x_{j}=\cos((2i-1)\pi/2n)   for    j  =   1  ,  …  ,  5       j   1  normal-…  5     j=1,...,5   . We can see on the picture that      I   x  1    r   =    I   x  2    r   =  1           subscript  I   subscript  x  1    r      subscript  I   subscript  x  2    r        1     I_{x_{1}}r=I_{x_{2}}r=1   and      I   x  4    r   =    I   x  5    r   =   -  1            subscript  I   subscript  x  4    r      subscript  I   subscript  x  5    r          1      I_{x_{4}}r=I_{x_{5}}r=-1   . For the pole in zero, we have      I   x  3    r   =  0         subscript  I   subscript  x  3    r   0    I_{x_{3}}r=0   since the left and right limits are equal (which is because p ( x ) also has a root in zero). We conclude that      I   -  1   1   r   =  0  =    I   -  ∞    +  ∞    r            superscript   subscript  I    1    1   r   0          superscript   subscript  I            r      I_{-1}^{1}r=0=I_{-\infty}^{+\infty}r   since q ( x ) has only five roots, all in [−1,1]. We cannot use here the Routh–Hurwitz theorem as each complex polynomial with f ( iy ) = q ( y ) + ip ( y ) has a zero on the imaginary line (namely at the origin).
