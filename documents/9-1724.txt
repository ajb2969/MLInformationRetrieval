Trimaximal mixing

Trimaximal mixing1 (also known as threefold maximal mixing2) refers to the highly symmetric, maximally CP-violating, 
 
 
fermion mixing configuration, characterised by a unitary matrix (
 
 
 
 ) having all its elements equal in modulus (
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 ) as may be written, e.g.:



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the complex cube roots of unity. In the standard PDG3 convention, trimaximal mixing corresponds to
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The Jarlskog 
 
 
 
 -violating parameter 
 
 
4 takes its extremal value 
 
 
 
 .
Originally proposed as a candidate lepton mixing matrix,56 and actively studied78910 as such (and even as a candidate quark mixing matrix11), trimaximal mixing is now definitively ruled-out as a phenomenologically viable lepton mixing scheme by neutrino oscillation experiments, especially the CHOOZ reactor experiment,12 in favour of the no longer tenable (related) tribimaximal mixing13 scheme.
