   Trimaximal mixing      Trimaximal mixing   Trimaximal mixing 1 (also known as threefold maximal mixing 2 ) refers to the highly symmetric, maximally CP-violating,    3  ×  3      3  3    3\times 3    fermion mixing configuration, characterised by a unitary matrix (   U   U   U   ) having all its elements equal in modulus (     |   U   a  i    |   =   1  /   3           subscript  U    a  i       1    3      |U_{ai}|=1/\sqrt{3}   ,      a  ,  i   =  1   ,   2  ,  3      formulae-sequence     a  i   1    2  3     a,i=1,2,3   ) as may be written, e.g.:      U  =   [       1   3         1   3         1   3           ω   3         1   3          ω  ¯    3            ω  ¯    3         1   3         ω   3        ]   ⇒   (    |   U   i  α    |   2   )   =   [       1  3        1  3        1  3          1  3        1  3        1  3          1  3        1  3        1  3       ]         U      1    3      1    3      1    3        ω    3      1    3       normal-¯  ω     3         normal-¯  ω     3      1    3      ω    3        normal-⇒     superscript     subscript  U    i  α     2            1  3     1  3     1  3       1  3     1  3     1  3       1  3     1  3     1  3        U=\begin{bmatrix}\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}&\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}&\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}\\

In the standard PDG 3 convention, trimaximal mixing corresponds to     θ  12   =   θ  23   =   π  /  4          subscript  θ  12    subscript  θ  23          π  4      \theta_{12}=\theta_{23}=\pi/4   ,     θ  13   =    sin   -  1     (   1  /   3    )         subscript  θ  13     superscript     1      1    3       \theta_{13}=\sin^{-1}(1/\sqrt{3})   and    δ  =   π  /  2       δ    π  2     \delta=\pi/2   . The Jarlskog    C  P      C  P    CP   -violating parameter   J   J   J    4 takes its extremal value     |  J  |   =   1  /   (   6   3    )          J     1    6    3       |J|=1/(6\sqrt{3})   .  Originally proposed as a candidate lepton mixing matrix, 5 6 and actively studied 7 8 9 10 as such (and even as a candidate quark mixing matrix 11 ), trimaximal mixing is now definitively ruled-out as a phenomenologically viable lepton mixing scheme by neutrino oscillation experiments, especially the CHOOZ reactor experiment, 12 in favour of the no longer tenable (related) tribimaximal mixing 13 scheme.
