Wiener amalgam space

In mathematics, amalgam spaces categorize functions with regard to their local and global behavior. While the concept of function spaces treating local and global behavior separately was already known earlier, Wiener amalgams, as the term is used today, were introduced by Hans Georg Feichtinger in 1980. The concept is named after Norbert Wiener.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a normed space with norm

  and global component 
 
 
 
 , a weighted 
 
 
 
  space with non-negative weight 
 
 
 
 , is defined by



where

 , for all 
 
 
 
 . Again, the space defined is independent of 
 
 
 
 . As the definition suggests, Wiener amalgams are useful to describe functions showing characteristic local and global behavior.2
