   Local Euler characteristic formula      Local Euler characteristic formula   In the mathematical field of Galois cohomology , the local Euler characteristic formula is a result due to John Tate that computes the Euler characteristic of the group cohomology of the absolute Galois group  G K of a non-archimedean local field  K .  Statement  Let K be a non-archimedean local field, let K s denote a separable closure of K , let G K =¬†Gal( K s / K ) be the absolute Galois group of K , and let H i ( K , M ) denote the group cohomology of G K with coefficients in M . Since the cohomological dimension of G K is two, 1  H i ( K , M )¬†=¬†0 for i ‚â•¬†3. Therefore, the Euler characteristic only involves the groups with i =¬†0,¬†1,¬†2.  Case of finite modules  Let M be a G K -module of finite order  m . The Euler characteristic of M is defined to be 2       œá   (   G  K   ,  M  )    =      #   H  0    (  K  ,  M  )    ‚ãÖ  #    H  2    (  K  ,  M  )     #   H  1    (  K  ,  M  )           œá    subscript  G  K   M         normal-‚ãÖ    normal-#   superscript  H  0    K  M    normal-#    superscript  H  2    K  M      normal-#   superscript  H  1    K  M       \chi(G_{K},M)=\frac{\#H^{0}(K,M)\cdot\#H^{2}(K,M)}{\#H^{1}(K,M)}   (the i th cohomology groups for i ‚â•¬†3 appear tacitly as their sizes are all one).  Let R denote the ring of integers of K . Tate's result then states that if m is relatively prime to the characteristic of K , then 3        œá   (   G  K   ,  M  )    =    (     #  R   /  m   R   )    -  1     ,        œá    subscript  G  K   M     superscript        normal-#  R   m   R     1      \chi(G_{K},M)=\left(\#R/mR\right)^{-1},   i.e. the inverse of the order of the quotient ring  R / mR .  Two special cases worth singling out are the following. If the order of M is relatively prime to the characteristic of the residue field of K , then the Euler characteristic is one. If K is a finite extension of the p -adic numbers  Q p , and if v p denotes the p -adic valuation , then       œá   (   G  K   ,  M  )    =   p   -   [  K  :   ùêê  p   ]    v  p    (  m  )           œá    subscript  G  K   M     superscript  p   fragments    fragments  normal-[  K  normal-:   subscript  ùêê  p   normal-]    subscript  v  p    fragments  normal-(  m  normal-)       \chi(G_{K},M)=p^{-[K:\mathbf{Q}_{p}]v_{p}(m)}   where [ K : Q p ] is the degree of K over Q p .  The Euler characteristic can be rewritten, using local Tate duality , as       œá   (   G  K   ,  M  )    =      #   H  0    (  K  ,  M  )    ‚ãÖ  #    H  0    (  K  ,   M  ‚Ä≤   )     #   H  1    (  K  ,  M  )           œá    subscript  G  K   M         normal-‚ãÖ    normal-#   superscript  H  0    K  M    normal-#    superscript  H  0    K   superscript  M  normal-‚Ä≤       normal-#   superscript  H  1    K  M       \chi(G_{K},M)=\frac{\#H^{0}(K,M)\cdot\#H^{0}(K,M^{\prime})}{\#H^{1}(K,M)}   where M ‚Ä≤ is the local Tate dual of M .
