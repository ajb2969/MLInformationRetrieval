A polynomial of degree 0 is always homogeneous; it is simply an element of the field or ring of the coefficients, usually called a constant or a scalar. A form of degree 1 is a linear form. 2 A form of degree 2 is a quadratic form . In geometry , the Euclidean distance is the square root of a quadratic form.  Homogeneous polynomials are ubiquitous in mathematics and physics. 3 They play a fundamental role in algebraic geometry, as a projective algebraic variety is defined as the set of the common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials.  Properties  A homogeneous polynomial defines a homogeneous function . This means that a multivariate polynomial  P is homogeneous of degree d if and only if        P   (   λ   x  1    ,  …  ,   λ   x  n    )    =     λ  d    P   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )     ,        P     λ   subscript  x  1    normal-…    λ   subscript  x  n         superscript  λ  d   P    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       P(\lambda x_{1},\ldots,\lambda x_{n})=\lambda^{d}\,P(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})\,,   for every   λ   λ   \lambda   in the field of the coefficients . In particular, if P is homogeneous then         P   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =   0  ⇒      P   (   λ   x  1    ,  …  ,   λ   x  n    )    =  0    ,     formulae-sequence      P    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n      0  normal-⇒        P     λ   subscript  x  1    normal-…    λ   subscript  x  n      0     P(x_{1},\ldots,x_{n})=0\quad\Rightarrow\quad P(\lambda x_{1},\ldots,\lambda x_%
 {n})=0,   for every    λ  .    λ   \lambda.   This property is fundamental in the definition of a projective variety .  Any nonzero polynomial may be decomposed, in a unique way, as a sum of homogeneous polynomials of different degrees, which are called the homogeneous components of the polynomial.  Given a polynomial ring     R  =   K   [   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ]        R    K    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       R=K[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}]   over a field (or, more generally, a ring ) K , the homogeneous polynomials of degree d form a vector space (or a module ), commonly denoted     R  d   .     subscript  R  d    R_{d}.   The above unique decomposition means that   R   R   R   is the direct sum of the    R  d     subscript  R  d    R_{d}   (sum over all nonnegative integers ).  The dimension of the vector space (or free module )    R  d     subscript  R  d    R_{d}   is the number of different monomials of degree d in n variables (that is the maximal number of nonzero terms in a homogeneous polynomial of degree d in n variables). It is equal to the binomial coefficient        (       d  +  n   -  1        n  -  1      )   =   (       d  +  n   -  1       d     )   =     (    d  +  n   -  1   )   !     d  !     (   n  -  1   )   !      .         binomial      d  n   1     n  1     binomial      d  n   1   d                d  n   1        d       n  1         {\left({{d+n-1}\atop{n-1}}\right)}={\left({{d+n-1}\atop{d}}\right)}=\frac{(d+n%
 -1)!}{d!(n-1)!}.     Homogenization  A non-homogeneous polynomial P ( x 1 ,..., x n ) can be homogenized by introducing an additional variable x 0 and defining the homogeneous polynomial sometimes denoted h P : 4         P    h    (   x  0   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =    x  0  d   P   (    x  1    x  0    ,  …  ,    x  n    x  0    )     ,         superscript  P  h     subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n        superscript   subscript  x  0   d   P      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  0    normal-…     subscript  x  n    subscript  x  0        {{}^{h}\!P}(x_{0},x_{1},\dots,x_{n})=x_{0}^{d}P\left(\frac{x_{1}}{x_{0}},\dots%
 ,\frac{x_{n}}{x_{0}}\right),   where d is the degree of P . For example, if       P  =    x  3  3   +    x  1    x  2    +  7    ,      P     superscript   subscript  x  3   3      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    7     P=x_{3}^{3}+x_{1}x_{2}+7,   then        P    h   =    x  3  3   +    x  0    x  1    x  2    +   7   x  0  3      .       superscript  P  h      superscript   subscript  x  3   3      subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      7   superscript   subscript  x  0   3       {}^{h}\!P=x_{3}^{3}+x_{0}x_{1}x_{2}+7x_{0}^{3}.     A homogenized polynomial can be dehomogenized by setting the additional variable x 0 = 1. That is        P   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =    P    h    (  1  ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )     .        P    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n        superscript  P  h    1   subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n       P(x_{1},\dots,x_{n})={{}^{h}\!P}(1,x_{1},\dots,x_{n}).     Algebraic forms in general  Algebraic forms, or simply forms, generalize quadratic forms to any degree, and have in the past also been known as quantics (a term that originated with Cayley ). To specify a type of form, one has to give the degree d and the number of variables n . A form is over some given field  K , if it maps from K n to K , where n is the number of variables of the form.  A form f over some field K in n variables represents 0 if there exists an element ( x 1 , ..., x n ) in K n such that f ( x 1 ,..., x n ) = 0 and at least one of the x i is not equal to zero.  A quadratic form over the field of the real numbers represents 0 if and only if it is not definite .

"Linear functional" is rarely used for finite-dimensional vector spaces. ↩  Homogeneous polynomials in physics often appear as a consequence of dimensional analysis , where measured quantities must match in real-world problems. ↩  D.
