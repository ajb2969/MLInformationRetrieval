Zero-dimensional space

In mathematics, a zero-dimensional topological space (or nildimensional) is a topological space that has dimension zero with respect to one of several inequivalent notions of assigning a dimension to a given topological space.12 An illustration of a nildimensional space is a point.3
Definition
Specifically:

A topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the Lebesgue covering dimension if every finite open cover of the space has a finite refinement which is a cover of the space by open sets such that any point in the space is contained in exactly one open set of this refinement.
A topological space is zero-dimensional with respect to the small inductive dimension if it has a base consisting of clopen sets.

The two notions above agree for separable, metrisable spaces.
Properties of spaces with covering dimension zero

A zero-dimensional Hausdorff space is necessarily totally disconnected, but the converse fails. However, a locally compact Hausdorff space is zero-dimensional if and only if it is totally disconnected. (See  for the non-trivial direction.)


Zero-dimensional Polish spaces are a particularly convenient setting for descriptive set theory. Examples of such spaces include the Cantor space and Baire space.


Hausdorff zero-dimensional spaces are precisely the subspaces of topological powers

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is given the discrete topology. Such a space is sometimes called a Cantor cube. If 
 
 
 
  is countably infinite, 
 
 
 
  is the Cantor space.
