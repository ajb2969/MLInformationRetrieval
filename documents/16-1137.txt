Mean of a function

In calculus, and especially multivariable calculus, the mean of a function is loosely defined as the average value of the function over its domain. In one variable, the mean of a function f(x) over the interval (a,b) is defined by



Recall that a defining property of the average value 
 
 
 
  of finitely many numbers 
 
 
 
  is that 
 
 
 
 . In other words, 
 
 
 
  is the constant value which when added to itself 
 
 
 
  times equals the result of adding the 
 
 
 
  terms of 
 
 
 
 . By analogy, a defining property of the average value 
 
 
 
  of a function over the interval 
 
 
 
  is that



In other words, 
 
 
 
  is the constant value which when integrated over 
 
 
 
  equals the result of integrating 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 
 
 . But by the second fundamental theorem of calculus, the integral of a constant 
 
 
 
  is just



See also the first mean value theorem for integration, which guarantees that if 
 
 
 
  is continuous then there exists a point 
 
 
 
  such that



The point 
 
 
 
  is called the mean value of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . So we write 
 
 
 
  and rearrange the preceding equation to get the above definition.
In several variables, the mean over a relatively compact domain U in a Euclidean space is defined by



This generalizes the arithmetic mean. On the other hand, it is also possible to generalize the geometric mean to functions by defining the geometric mean of f to be



More generally, in measure theory and probability theory, either sort of mean plays an important role. In this context, Jensen's inequality places sharp estimates on the relationship between these two different notions of the mean of a function.
There is also a harmonic average of functions and a quadratic average (or root mean square) of functions.
