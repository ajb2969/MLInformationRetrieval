   Mean of a function      Mean of a function   In calculus , and especially multivariable calculus , the mean of a function is loosely defined as the average value of the function over its domain . In one variable, the mean of a function f ( x ) over the interval ( a,b ) is defined by        f  ¯   =    1   b  -  a      ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  x      .       normal-¯  f       1    b  a      superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  x       \bar{f}=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx.     Recall that a defining property of the average value    y  ¯     normal-¯  y    \bar{y}   of finitely many numbers     y  1   ,   y  2   ,  …  ,   y  n       subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2   normal-…   subscript  y  n     y_{1},y_{2},\dots,y_{n}   is that     n   y  ¯    =    y  1   +   y  2   +  ⋯  +   y  n          n   normal-¯  y       subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2   normal-⋯   subscript  y  n      n\bar{y}=y_{1}+y_{2}+\cdots+y_{n}   . In other words,    y  ¯     normal-¯  y    \bar{y}   is the constant value which when added to itself   n   n   n   times equals the result of adding the   n   n   n   terms of    y  i     subscript  y  i    y_{i}   . By analogy, a defining property of the average value    f  ¯     normal-¯  f    \bar{f}   of a function over the interval    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   is that        ∫  a  b      f  ¯    d  x    =    ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  x          superscript   subscript   a   b      normal-¯  f   d  x      superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  x      \int_{a}^{b}\bar{f}\,dx=\int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx     In other words,    f  ¯     normal-¯  f    \bar{f}   is the constant value which when integrated over    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   equals the result of integrating    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   over    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   . But by the second fundamental theorem of calculus , the integral of a constant    f  ¯     normal-¯  f    \bar{f}   is just        ∫  a  b      f  ¯    d  x    =      f  ¯   x   |   a  b   =     f  ¯   b   -    f  ¯   a    =    (   b  -  a   )    f  ¯            superscript   subscript   a   b      normal-¯  f   d  x     evaluated-at     normal-¯  f   x   a  b             normal-¯  f   b      normal-¯  f   a             b  a    normal-¯  f       \int_{a}^{b}\bar{f}\,dx=\bar{f}x\bigr|_{a}^{b}=\bar{f}b-\bar{f}a=(b-a)\bar{f}     See also the first mean value theorem for integration , which guarantees that if   f   f   f   is continuous then there exists a point    c  ∈   (  a  ,  b  )       c   a  b     c\in(a,b)   such that        ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )   d  x    =   f   (  c  )    (   b  -  a   )          superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x  d  x      f  c    b  a      \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\,dx=f(c)(b-a)     The point    f   (  c  )       f  c    f(c)   is called the mean value of    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   on    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   . So we write     f  ¯   =   f   (  c  )         normal-¯  f     f  c     \bar{f}=f(c)   and rearrange the preceding equation to get the above definition.  In several variables, the mean over a relatively compact  domain  U in a Euclidean space is defined by        f  ¯   =    1   Vol   (  U  )       ∫  U   f     .       normal-¯  f       1    Vol  U      subscript   U   f      \bar{f}=\frac{1}{\hbox{Vol}(U)}\int_{U}f.     This generalizes the arithmetic mean. On the other hand, it is also possible to generalize the geometric mean to functions by defining the geometric mean of f to be       exp   (    1   Vol   (  U  )       ∫  U    log  f     )    .          1    Vol  U      subscript   U     f       \exp\left(\frac{1}{\hbox{Vol}(U)}\int_{U}\log f\right).     More generally, in measure theory and probability theory , either sort of mean plays an important role. In this context, Jensen's inequality places sharp estimates on the relationship between these two different notions of the mean of a function.  There is also a harmonic average of functions and a quadratic average (or root mean square ) of functions.  See also   Mean   "  Category:Means  Category:Calculus
