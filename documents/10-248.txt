Smooth coarea formula

In Riemannian geometry, the smooth coarea formulas relate integrals over the domain of certain mappings with integrals over their codomains.
Let 
 
 
 
  be smooth Riemannian manifolds of respective dimensions 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a smooth surjection such that the pushforward (differential) of 
 
 
 
  is surjective almost everywhere. Let 
 
 
 
  a measurable function. Then, the following two equalities hold:






where 
 
 
 
  is the normal Jacobian of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the determinant of the derivative restricted to the orthogonal complement of its kernel.
Note that from Sard's lemma almost every point 
 
 
 
  is a regular point of 
 
 
 
  and hence the set 
 
 
 
  is a Riemannian submanifold of 
 
 
 
 , so the integrals in the right-hand side of the formulas above make sense.
