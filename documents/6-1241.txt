The quadrifolium (also known as four-leaved clover1) is a type of rose curve with n=2. It has polar equation:



with corresponding algebraic equation



Rotated by 45°, this becomes



with corresponding algebraic equation



In either form, it is a plane algebraic curve of genus zero.
The dual curve to the quadrifolium is

The area inside the curve is 
 
 
 
 , which is exactly half of the area of the circumcircle of the quadrifolium. The length of the curve is ca. 9.6884.2
