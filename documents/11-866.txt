   Beta-glucogallin O-galloyltransferase      Beta-glucogallin O-galloyltransferase   In enzymology , a beta-glucogallin O-galloyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + 1-O,6-O-digalloyl-beta-D-glucose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose , and two products , D-glucose and 1-O,6-O-digalloyl-beta-D-glucose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose:1-O-galloyl-beta-D-glucose O-galloyltransferase .  References      "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
