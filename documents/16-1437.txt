Gopakumar–Vafa invariant

In theoretical physics Rajesh Gopakumar and Cumrun Vafa introduced new topological invariants, which named Gopakumar–Vafa invariant, that represent the number of BPS states on Calabi–Yau 3-fold, in a series of papers. (see , and also see , .)　They lead the following formula generating function for the Gromov–Witten invariant on Calabi–Yau 3-fold M.



where 
 
 
 
  is Gromov–Witten invariant, 
 
 
 
  the number of pseudoholomorphic curves with genus g and 
 
 
 
  the number of the BPS states.
As a partition function in topological quantum field theory
Gopakumar–Vafa invariants can be viewed as a partition function in topological quantum field theory.　They are proposed to be the partition function in Gopakumar–Vafa form:
