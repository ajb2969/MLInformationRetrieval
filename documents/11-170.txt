Abietadiene synthase

In enzymology, an abietadiene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(+)-copalyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (−)-abietadiene + diphosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (+)-copalyl diphosphate, and two products, (−)-abietadiene and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+)-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase [cyclizing (−)-abietadiene-forming]. This enzyme is also called copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing). This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis.
It has recently been shown (Keeling, et al., 2011) that the orthologous gene in Norway spruce (Picea abies) does not produce abietadiene directly, but instead produces a thermally unstable allylic tertiary alcohol 13-hydroxy-8(14)- abietene, which readily dehydrates to abietadiene, levopimaradiene, palustradiene, and neoabietadiene, when analyzed by the commonly used gas chromatography. This has been confirmed in the other conifer species, lodgepole pine ("Pinus contorta") and Jack pine ("Pinus banksiana") (Hall et al., 2013).
