   Order isomorphism      Order isomorphism   In the mathematical field of order theory an order isomorphism is a special kind of monotone function that constitutes a suitable notion of isomorphism for partially ordered sets (posets). Whenever two posets are order isomorphic, they can be considered to be "essentially the same" in the sense that one of the orders can be obtained from the other just by renaming of elements. Two strictly weaker notions that relate to order isomorphisms are order embeddings and Galois connections . 1  Definition  Formally, given two posets    (  S  ,   ≤  S   )     S   subscript   S     (S,\leq_{S})   and    (  T  ,   ≤  T   )     T   subscript   T     (T,\leq_{T})   , an order isomorphism from    (  S  ,   ≤  S   )     S   subscript   S     (S,\leq_{S})   to    (  T  ,   ≤  T   )     T   subscript   T     (T,\leq_{T})   is a bijective function    f   f   f   from   S   S   S   to   T   T   T   with the property that, for every   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   in   S   S   S   ,    x   ≤  S   y      subscript   S   x  y    x\leq_{S}y   if and only if     f   (  x  )     ≤  T    f   (  y  )        subscript   T     f  x     f  y     f(x)\leq_{T}f(y)   . That is, it is a bijective order-embedding . 2  It is also possible to define an order isomorphism to be a surjective order-embedding. The two assumptions that   f   f   f   cover all the elements of   T   T   T   and that it preserve orderings, are enough to ensure that   f   f   f   is also one-to-one, for if     f   (  x  )    =   f   (  y  )          f  x     f  y     f(x)=f(y)   then (by the assumption that   f   f   f   preserves the order) it would follow that    x  ≤  y      x  y    x\leq y   and    y  ≤  x      y  x    y\leq x   , implying by the definition of a partial order that    x  =  y      x  y    x=y   .  Yet another characterization of order isomorphisms is that they are exactly the monotone  bijections that have a monotone inverse. 3  An order isomorphism from a partially ordered set to itself is called an order automorphism . 4  Examples   The identity function on any partially ordered set is always an order automorphism.  Negation is an order isomorphism from    (  ℝ  ,  ≤  )     ℝ     (\mathbb{R},\leq)   to    (  ℝ  ,  ≥  )     ℝ     (\mathbb{R},\geq)   (where   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   is the set of real numbers and   ≤     \leq   denotes the usual numerical comparison), since − x ≥ − y if and only if x ≤ y . 5  The open interval     (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)   (again, ordered numerically) does not have an order isomorphism to or from the closed interval     [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   : the closed interval has a least element, but the open interval does not, and order isomorphisms must preserve the existence of least elements. 6   Order types  If   f   f   f   is an order isomorphism, then so is its inverse function . Also, if   f   f   f   is an order isomorphism from    (  S  ,   ≤  S   )     S   subscript   S     (S,\leq_{S})   to    (  T  ,   ≤  T   )     T   subscript   T     (T,\leq_{T})   and   g   g   g   is an order isomorphism from    (  T  ,   ≤  T   )     T   subscript   T     (T,\leq_{T})   to    (  U  ,   ≤  U   )     U   subscript   U     (U,\leq_{U})   , then the function composition of   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   is itself an order isomorphism, from    (  S  ,   ≤  S   )     S   subscript   S     (S,\leq_{S})   to    (  U  ,   ≤  U   )     U   subscript   U     (U,\leq_{U})   . 7  Two partially ordered sets are said to be order isomorphic when there exists an order isomorphism from one to the other. 8 Identity functions, function inverses, and compositions of functions correspond, respectively, to the three defining characteristics of an equivalence relation : reflexivity , symmetry , and transitivity . Therefore, order isomorphism is an equivalence relation. The class of partially ordered sets can be partitioned by it into equivalence classes , families of partially ordered sets that are all isomorphic to each other. These equivalence classes are called order types .  See also   Permutation pattern , a permutation that is order-isomorphic to a subsequence of another permutation   Notes  References    .   .   .
