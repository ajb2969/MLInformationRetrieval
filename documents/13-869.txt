Order isomorphism

In the mathematical field of order theory an order isomorphism is a special kind of monotone function that constitutes a suitable notion of isomorphism for partially ordered sets (posets). Whenever two posets are order isomorphic, they can be considered to be "essentially the same" in the sense that one of the orders can be obtained from the other just by renaming of elements. Two strictly weaker notions that relate to order isomorphisms are order embeddings and Galois connections.1
Definition
Formally, given two posets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , an order isomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is a bijective function

 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  with the property that, for every 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 . That is, it is a bijective order-embedding.2
It is also possible to define an order isomorphism to be a surjective order-embedding. The two assumptions that 
 
 
 
  cover all the elements of 
 
 
 
  and that it preserve orderings, are enough to ensure that 
 
 
 
  is also one-to-one, for if 
 
 
 
  then (by the assumption that 
 
 
 
  preserves the order) it would follow that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , implying by the definition of a partial order that 
 
 
 
 .
Yet another characterization of order isomorphisms is that they are exactly the monotone bijections that have a monotone inverse.3
An order isomorphism from a partially ordered set to itself is called an order automorphism.4
Examples

The identity function on any partially ordered set is always an order automorphism.
Negation is an order isomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is the set of real numbers and 
 
 
 
  denotes the usual numerical comparison), since −x ≥ −y if and only if x ≤ y.5
The open interval

 
  (again, ordered numerically) does not have an order isomorphism to or from the closed interval

 
 : the closed interval has a least element, but the open interval does not, and order isomorphisms must preserve the existence of least elements.6

Order types
If 
 
 
 
  is an order isomorphism, then so is its inverse function. Also, if 
 
 
 
  is an order isomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an order isomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , then the function composition of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is itself an order isomorphism, from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .7
Two partially ordered sets are said to be order isomorphic when there exists an order isomorphism from one to the other.8 Identity functions, function inverses, and compositions of functions correspond, respectively, to the three defining characteristics of an equivalence relation: reflexivity, symmetry, and transitivity. Therefore, order isomorphism is an equivalence relation. The class of partially ordered sets can be partitioned by it into equivalence classes, families of partially ordered sets that are all isomorphic to each other. These equivalence classes are called order types.
