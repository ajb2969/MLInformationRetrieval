Berndt–Hall–Hall–Hausman algorithm

The Berndt–Hall–Hall–Hausman (BHHH) algorithm is a numerical optimization algorithm similar to the Gauss–Newton algorithm. It is named after the four originators: Ernst R. Berndt, B. Hall, Robert Hall, and Jerry Hausman.
Usage
If a nonlinear model is fitted to the data one often needs to estimate coefficients through optimization. A number of optimisation algorithms have the following general structure. Suppose that the function to be optimized is Q(β). Then the algorithms are iterative, defining a sequence of approximations, βk given by


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the parameter estimate at step k, and 
 
 
 
  is a parameter (called step size) which partly determines the particular algorithm. For the BHHH algorithm λk is determined by calculations within a given iterative step, involving a line-search until a point ''βk''+1 is found satisfying certain criteria. In addition, for the BHHH algorithm, Q has the form


 
  and A is calculated using


 
  In other cases, e.g. Newton–Raphson, 
 
 
 
  can have other forms. The BHHH algorithm has the advantage that, if certain conditions apply, convergence of the iterative procedure is guaranteed.
