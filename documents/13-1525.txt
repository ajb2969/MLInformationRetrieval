In probability theory and statistics, the bivariate von Mises distribution is a probability distribution describing values on a torus. It may be thought of as an analogue on the torus of the bivariate normal distribution. The distribution belongs to the field of directional statistics. The general bivariate von Mises distribution was first proposed by Kanti Mardia in 1975.12 One of its variants is today used in the field of bioinformatics to formulate a probabilistic model of protein structure in atomic detail.34
Definition
The bivariate von Mises distribution is a probability distribution defined on the torus, 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . The probability density function of the general bivariate von Mises distribution for the angles 
 
 
 
  is given by5



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the means for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  their concentration and the matrix 
 
 
 
  is related to their correlation.
Two commonly used variants of the bivariate von Mises distribution are the sine and cosine variant.
The cosine variant of the bivariate von Mises distribution6 has the probability density function



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the means for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  their concentration and 
 
 
 
  is related to their correlation. 
 
 
 
  is the normalization constant. This distribution with 
 
 
 
 =0 has been used for kernel density estimates of the distribution of the protein dihedral angles 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .7
The sine variant has the probability density function8



where the parameters have the same interpretation.
