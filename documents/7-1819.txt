   Zero-lift drag coefficient      Zero-lift drag coefficient   In aerodynamics , the zero-lift drag coefficient     C   D  ,  0      subscript  C   D  0     C_{D,0}   is a dimensionless parameter which relates an aircraft's zero-lift drag  force to its size, speed, and flying altitude.  Mathematically, zero-lift drag coefficient is defined as     C   D  ,  0    =    C  D   -   C   D  ,  i          subscript  C   D  0       subscript  C  D    subscript  C   D  i       C_{D,0}=C_{D}-C_{D,i}   , where    C  D     subscript  C  D    C_{D}   is the total drag coefficient for a given power, speed, and altitude, and    C   D  ,  i      subscript  C   D  i     C_{D,i}   is the lift-induced drag coefficient at the same conditions. Thus, zero-lift drag coefficient is reflective of parasitic drag which makes it very useful in understanding how "clean" or streamlined an aircraft's aerodynamics are. For example, a Sopwith Camel biplane of World War I which had many wires and bracing struts as well as fixed landing gear, had a zero-lift drag coefficient of approximately 0.0378. Compare a    C   D  ,  0      subscript  C   D  0     C_{D,0}   value of 0.0161 for the streamlined P-51 Mustang of World War II 1 which compares very favorably even with the best modern aircraft.  The drag at zero-lift can be more easily conceptualized as the drag area (    f   f   f    ) which is simply the product of zero-lift drag coefficient and aircraft's wing area (     C   D  ,  0    ×  S       subscript  C   D  0    S    C_{D,0}\times S   where   S   S   S   is the wing area). Parasitic drag experienced by an aircraft with a given drag area is approximately equal to the drag of a flat square disk with the same area which is held perpendicular to the direction of flight. The Sopwith Camel has a drag area of , compared to  for the P-51. Both aircraft have a similar wing area, again reflecting the Mustang's superior aerodynamics in spite of much larger size. 2 In another comparison with the Camel, a very large but streamlined aircraft such as the Lockheed Constellation has a considerably smaller zero-lift drag coefficient (0.0211 vs. 0.0378) in spite of having a much larger drag area (34.82 ft² vs. 8.73 ft²).  Furthermore, an aircraft's maximum speed is proportional to the cube root of the ratio of power to drag area, that is:        V   m  a  x     ∝     p  o  w  e  r   /  f   3      proportional-to   subscript  V    m  a  x       3       p  o  w  e  r   f      V_{max}\ \propto\ \sqrt[3]{power/f}   . 3  Estimating zero-lift drag 4  As noted earlier,     C   D  ,  0    =    C  D   -   C   D  ,  i          subscript  C   D  0       subscript  C  D    subscript  C   D  i       C_{D,0}=C_{D}-C_{D,i}   .  The total drag coefficient can be estimated as:       C  D   =    550  η  P     1  2    ρ  0    [   σ  S    (   1.47  V   )   3    ]          subscript  C  D       550  η  P       1  2    subscript  ρ  0    delimited-[]    σ  S   superscript    1.47  V   3         C_{D}=\frac{550\eta P}{\frac{1}{2}\rho_{0}[\sigma S(1.47V)^{3}]}   ,  where   η   η   \eta   is the propulsive efficiency , P is engine power in horsepower ,    ρ  0     subscript  ρ  0    \rho_{0}   sea-level air density in slugs /cubic foot,   σ   σ   \sigma   is the atmospheric density ratio for an altitude other than sea level, S is the aircraft's wing area in square feet, and V is the aircraft's speed in miles per hour. Substituting 0.002378 for    ρ  0     subscript  ρ  0    \rho_{0}   , the equation is simplified to:       C  D   =    1.456  ×   10  5     (    η  P    σ  S   V  3     )         subscript  C  D       1.456   superscript  10  5        η  P     σ  S   superscript  V  3        C_{D}=1.456\times 10^{5}(\frac{\eta P}{\sigma SV^{3}})   .  The induced drag coefficient can be estimated as:       C   D  ,  i    =    C  L  2    π  A  ϵ         subscript  C   D  i       superscript   subscript  C  L   2     π  A  ϵ      C_{D,i}=\frac{C_{L}^{2}}{\pi A\epsilon}   ,  where    C  L     subscript  C  L    C_{L}   is the lift coefficient , A is the aspect ratio , and   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   is the aircraft's efficiency factor.  Substituting for    C  L     subscript  C  L    C_{L}   gives:       C   D  ,  i    =     4.822  ×   10  4     A  ϵ   σ  2    V  4       (   W  /  S   )   2         subscript  C   D  i          4.822   superscript  10  4      A  ϵ   superscript  σ  2    superscript  V  4      superscript    W  S   2      C_{D,i}=\frac{4.822\times 10^{4}}{A\epsilon\sigma^{2}V^{4}}(W/S)^{2}   ,  where W/S is the wing loading in lb/ft².
