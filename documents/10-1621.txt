Aspartate racemase




Aspartate racemase

In enzymology, an aspartate racemase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-aspartate 
 
 
 
  D-aspartate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, L-aspartate, and one product, D-aspartate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aspartate racemase. Other names in common use include D-aspartate racemase, and McyF. This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism.
Structural studies
