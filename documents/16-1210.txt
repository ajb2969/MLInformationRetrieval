   Conductor of an elliptic curve      Conductor of an elliptic curve   In mathematics, the conductor of an elliptic curve over the field of rational numbers , or more generally a local or global field , is an integral ideal analogous to the Artin conductor of a Galois representation. It is given as a product of prime ideals , together with associated exponents, which encode the ramification in the field extensions generated by the points of finite order in the group law of the elliptic curve . The primes involved in the conductor are precisely the primes of bad reduction of the curve: this is the N√©ron‚ÄìOgg‚ÄìShafarevich criterion .  Ogg's formula expresses the conductor in terms of the discriminant and the number of components of the special fiber over a local field, which can be computed using Tate's algorithm .  History  The conductor of an elliptic curve over a local field was implicitly studied (but not named) by  in the form of an integer invariant Œµ+Œ¥ which later turned out to be the exponent of the conductor.  The conductor of an elliptic curve over the rationals was introduced and named by  as a constant appearing in the functional equation of its L-series, analogous to the way the conductor of a global field appears in the functional equation of its zeta function. He showed that it could be written as a product over primes with exponents given by order(Œî) ‚àí Œº + 1, which by Ogg's formula is equal to Œµ+Œ¥. A similar definition works for any global field. Weil also suggested that the conductor was equal to the level of a modular form corresponding to the elliptic curve.  extended the theory to conductors of abelian varieties.  Definition  Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a local field  K and p the prime ideal of the ring of integers of K . We consider a minimal equation for E : a generalised Weierstrass equation whose coefficients are p -integral and with the valuation of the discriminant ŒΩ p (Œî) as small as possible. If the discriminant is a p -unit then E has good reduction at p and the exponent of the conductor is zero.  We can write the exponent f of the conductor as a sum Œµ + Œ¥ of 2 terms, corresponding to the tame and wild ramification. The tame ramification part Œµ is defined in terms of the reduction type: Œµ=0 for good reduction, Œµ=1 for multiplicative reduction and Œµ=2 for additive reduction. The wild ramification term Œ¥ is zero unless p divides 2 or 3, and in the latter cases it is defined in terms of the wild ramification of the extensions of K by the division points of E by Serre's formula       Œ¥  =    dim    Z  /  l   Z      Hom    Z  l    [  G  ]      (  P  ,  M  )      .      Œ¥    subscript  dimension      Z  l   Z       subscript  Hom     subscript  Z  l    delimited-[]  G      P  M       \delta=\dim_{Z/lZ}\text{Hom}_{Z_{l}[G]}(P,M).   Here M is the group of points on the elliptic curve of order l for a prime l , P is the Swan representation , and G the Galois group of a finite extension of K such that the points of M are defined over it (so that G acts on M )  Ogg's formula  The exponent of the conductor is related to other invariants of the elliptic curve by Ogg's formula:        f  ùê©   =      ŒΩ  ùê©    (  Œî  )    +  1   -   n     ,       subscript  f  ùê©          subscript  ŒΩ  ùê©   normal-Œî   1   n     f_{\mathbf{p}}=\nu_{\mathbf{p}}(\Delta)+1-n\ ,   where n is the number of components (without counting multiplicities) of the singular fibre of the N√©ron minimal model for E. (This is sometimes used as a definition of the conductor).  Ogg's original proof used a lot of case by case checking, especially in characteristics 2 and 3.  gave a uniform proof and generalized Ogg's formula to more general arithmetic surfaces.  We can also describe Œµ in terms of the valuation of the j-invariant ŒΩ p ( j ): it is 0 in the case of good reduction; otherwise it is 1 if ŒΩ p ( j ) p ( j ) ‚â• 0.  Global conductor  Let E be an elliptic curve defined over a number field K . The global conductor is the ideal given by the product over primes of K        f   (  E  )    =    ‚àè  ùê©     ùê©   f  ùê©       .        f  E     subscript  product  ùê©    superscript  ùê©   subscript  f  ùê©       f(E)=\prod_{\mathbf{p}}\mathbf{p}^{f_{\mathbf{p}}}\ .     This is a finite product as the primes of bad reduction are contained in the set of primes divisors of the discriminant of any model for E with global integral coefficients.
