   Stein manifold      Stein manifold   In the theory of several complex variables and complex manifolds in mathematics, a Stein manifold is a complex submanifold of the vector space of n  complex dimensions. They were introduced by and named after . A Stein space is similar to a Stein manifold but is allowed to have singularities. Stein spaces are the analogues of affine varieties or affine schemes in algebraic geometry.  Definition  A complex manifold    X   X   X   of complex dimension   n   n   n   is called a Stein manifold if the following conditions hold:      X   X   X   is holomorphically convex, i.e. for every compact subset    K  ⊂  X      K  X    K\subset X   , the so-called holomorphic convex hull ,           K  ¯   =   {   z  ∈  X   :    |   f   (  z  )    |   ≤    sup  K     |  f  |    ∀  f     ∈   𝒪   (  X  )     }    ,       normal-¯  K    conditional-set    z  X           f  z      subscript  supremum  K       f    for-all  f            𝒪  X        \bar{K}=\{z\in X:|f(z)|\leq\sup_{K}|f|\ \forall f\in\mathcal{O}(X)\},         is again a compact subset of   X   X   X   . Here    𝒪   (  X  )       𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}(X)   denotes the ring of holomorphic functions on   X   X   X   .       X   X   X   is holomorphically separable, i.e. if    x  ≠  y      x  y    x\neq y   are two points in   X   X   X   , then there is a holomorphic function         f  ∈   𝒪   (  X  )        f    𝒪  X     f\in\mathcal{O}(X)         such that      f   (  x  )    ≠   f   (  y  )     .        f  x     f  y     f(x)\neq f(y).      Non-compact Riemann surfaces are Stein  Let X be a connected non-compact Riemann surface. A deep theorem of Behnke and Stein (1948) asserts that X is a Stein manifold.  Another result, attributed to Grauert and Röhrl (1956), states moreover that every holomorphic vector bundle on X is trivial.  In particular, every line bundle is trivial, so      H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X  *   )    =  0         superscript  H  1    X   superscript   subscript  𝒪  X       0    H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*})=0   . The exponential sheaf sequence leads to the following exact sequence:        H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )    ⟶    H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X  *   )    ⟶    H  2    (  X  ,  ℤ  )    ⟶    H  2    (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )         normal-⟶     superscript  H  1    X   subscript  𝒪  X        superscript  H  1    X   superscript   subscript  𝒪  X         normal-⟶       superscript  H  2    X  ℤ      normal-⟶       superscript  H  2    X   subscript  𝒪  X        H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})\longrightarrow H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*})%
 \longrightarrow H^{2}(X,\mathbb{Z})\longrightarrow H^{2}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})     Now Cartan's theorem B shows that      H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )    =    H  2    (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )    =  0           superscript  H  1    X   subscript  𝒪  X        superscript  H  2    X   subscript  𝒪  X          0     H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})=H^{2}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X})=0   , therefore      H  2    (  X  ,  ℤ  )    =  0         superscript  H  2    X  ℤ    0    H^{2}(X,\mathbb{Z})=0   .  This is related to the solution of the Cousin problems , and more precisely to the second Cousin problem.  Properties and examples of Stein manifolds   The standard complex space    ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   is a Stein manifold.  Every domain of holomorphy in    ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    \mathbb{C}^{n}   is a Stein manifold.  It can be shown quite easily that every closed complex submanifold of a Stein manifold is a Stein manifold, too.  The embedding theorem for Stein manifolds states the following: Every Stein manifold   X   X   X   of complex dimension   n   n   n   can be embedded into    ℂ    2  n   +  1      superscript  ℂ      2  n   1     \mathbb{C}^{2n+1}   by a biholomorphic  proper map .   These facts imply that a Stein manifold is a closed complex submanifold of complex space, whose complex structure is that of the ambient space (because the embedding is biholomorphic).   In one complex dimension the Stein condition can be simplified: a connected Riemann surface is a Stein manifold if and only if it is not compact. This can be proved using a version of the Runge theorem for Riemann surfaces, due to Behnke and Stein.  Every Stein manifold   X   X   X   is holomorphically spreadable, i.e. for every point    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   , there are   n   n   n   holomorphic functions defined on all of   X   X   X   which form a local coordinate system when restricted to some open neighborhood of   x   x   x   .  Being a Stein manifold is equivalent to being a (complex) strongly pseudoconvex manifold . The latter means that it has a strongly pseudoconvex (or plurisubharmonic ) exhaustive function, i.e. a smooth real function   ψ   ψ   \psi   on   X   X   X   (which can be assumed to be a Morse function ) with     i   ∂    ∂  ¯   ψ     >  0        i       normal-¯    ψ     0    i\partial\bar{\partial}\psi>0   , such that the subsets    {    z  ∈  X   ,    ψ   (  z  )    ≤  c    }      formulae-sequence    z  X       ψ  z   c      \{z\in X,\psi(z)\leq c\}   are compact in   X   X   X   for every real number   c   c   c   . This is a solution to the so-called Levi problem , 1 named after E. E. Levi (1911). The function   ψ   ψ   \psi   invites a generalization of Stein manifold to the idea of a corresponding class of compact complex manifolds with boundary called Stein domains . A Stein domain is the preimage    {  z  |    -  ∞   ≤   ψ   (  z  )    ≤  c   }     conditional-set  z            ψ  z        c      \{z|-\infty\leq\psi(z)\leq c\}   . Some authors call such manifolds therefore strictly pseudoconvex manifolds.  Related to the previous item, another equivalent and more topological definition in complex dimension 2 is the following: a Stein surface is a complex surface X with a real-valued Morse function f on X such that, away from the critical points of f , the field of complex tangencies to the preimage X c = f −1 ( c ) is a contact structure that induces an orientation on X c agreeing with the usual orientation as the boundary of f −1 (−∞, c ). That is, f −1 (−∞, c ) is a Stein filling of X c .   Numerous further characterizations of such manifolds exist, in particular capturing the property of their having "many" holomorphic functions taking values in the complex numbers. See for example Cartan's theorems A and B , relating to sheaf cohomology . The initial impetus was to have a description of the properties of the domain of definition of the (maximal) analytic continuation of an analytic function .  In the GAGA set of analogies, Stein manifolds correspond to affine varieties .  Stein manifolds are in some sense dual to the elliptic manifolds in complex analysis which admit "many" holomorphic functions from the complex numbers into themselves. It is known that a Stein manifold is elliptic if and only if it is fibrant in the sense of so-called "holomorphic homotopy theory".  Relation to smooth manifolds  Every compact smooth manifold of dimension 2n, which has only handles of index ≤ n, has a Stein structure provided n>2, and when n=2 the same holds provided the 2-handles are attached with certain framings (framing less than the Thurston-Bennequin framing). 2 3 Every closed smooth 4-manifold is a union of two Stein 4-manifolds glued along their common boundary. 4  Notes    References    (including a proof of Behnke-Stein and Grauert-Röhrl theorems)   (including a proof of the embedding theorem)   (definitions and constructions of Stein domains and manifolds in dimension 4)     "  Category:Complex manifolds     PlanetMath: solution of the Levi problem ↩  Y.
