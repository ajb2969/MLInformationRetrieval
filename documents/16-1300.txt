Kardashian Index

The Kardashian Index (K-Index), named after Kim Kardashian, is a metric measuring the discrepancy between a scientist's social media profile and publication record.1 Proposed in 2014, the measure compares the number of followers a research scientist has on Twitter to the number of citations they have for their peer-reviewed work.
The relationship between the number of Twitter followers (F) and the number of citations (C) is described as:



The Kardashian Index is thus calculated as:



where F(a) is the actual number of Twitter followers of researcher X and F(c) is the number researcher should have given their citations.
Interpretation
A high K-index indicates an over-blown scientific fame while a low K-index suggests that a scientist is being undervalued. According to the author, researchers whose K-index > 5 can be considered 'Science Kardashians'.
Criticism
The K-index suggests that the number of citations of a given scientist is comparable to his or her scientific value. This assumption has been criticized.23
