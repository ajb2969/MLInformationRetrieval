   Convex position      Convex position   In discrete and computational geometry , a set of points in the Euclidean plane is said to be in convex position or convex independent if none of the points can be represented as a convex combination of the others. 1 A finite set of points is in convex position if all of the points are vertices of their convex hull . 2 More generally, a family of convex sets is said to be in convex position if they are pairwise disjoint and none of them is contained in the convex hull of the others. 3  An assumption of convex position can make certain computational problems easier to solve. For instance, the traveling salesman problem , NP-hard for arbitrary sets of points in the plane, is trivial for points in convex position: the optimal tour is the convex hull. 4 Similarly, the minimum-weight triangulation is NP-hard for arbitrary point sets, 5 but solvable in polynomial time by dynamic programming for points in convex position. 6  The Erdős–Szekeres theorem guarantees that every set of n points in general position (no three in a line) has at least a logarithmic number of points in convex position. 7 If n points are chosen uniformly at random in a unit square , the probability that they are in convex position is 8        (    (       2  n   -  2        n  -  1      )   /   n  !    )   2   .     superscript     binomial      2  n   2     n  1      n    2    \left({\left({{2n-2}\atop{n-1}}\right)}/n!\right)^{2}.
