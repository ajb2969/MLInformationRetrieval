   Capillary pressure      Capillary pressure   In fluid statics , capillary pressure is the difference in pressure across the interface between two immiscible fluids, and thus defined as       p  c   =    p  non-wetting phase   -   p  wetting phase         subscript  p  c      subscript  p  non-wetting phase    subscript  p  wetting phase      p_{c}=p_{\text{non-wetting phase}}-p_{\text{wetting phase}}   In oil-water systems, water is typically the wetting phase, while for gas-oil systems, oil is typically the wetting phase.  The Young–Laplace equation states that this pressure difference is proportional to the interfacial tension ,   γ   γ   \gamma   , and inversely proportional to the effective radius,   r   r   r   , of the interface, it also depends on the wetting angle ,   θ   θ   \theta   , of the liquid on the surface of the capillary.       p  c   =    2  γ   cos  θ    r        subscript  p  c       2  γ    θ    r     p_{c}=\frac{2\gamma\cos\theta}{r}     The equation for capillary pressure is only valid under capillary equilibrium, which means that there can not be any flowing phases.  In porous media  In porous media , capillary pressure is the force necessary to squeeze a hydrocarbon droplet through a pore throat (works against the interfacial tension between oil and water phases) and is higher for smaller pore diameter. The expression for the capillary pressure remains as before, i.e.,      p  c   =    p  non-wetting phase   -   p  wetting phase.         subscript  p  c      subscript  p  non-wetting phase    subscript  p  wetting phase.      p_{c}=p_{\text{non-wetting phase}}-p_{\text{wetting phase.}}   However, the quantities    p  c     subscript  p  c    p_{c}   ,    p  non-wetting phase     subscript  p  non-wetting phase    p_{\text{non-wetting phase}}   and    p  wetting phase     subscript  p  wetting phase    p_{\text{wetting phase}}   are quantities that are obtained by averaging these quantities within the pore space of porous media either statistically or using the volume averaging method. 1  The Brooks-Corey correlation Brooks, R.H. and Corey, A.T.: “Hydraulic properties of porous  media,” Hydraulic paper no. 3, Colorado State University, 1964. for capillary pressure reads       p  c   =   c   S  w   -  a          subscript  p  c     c   superscript   subscript  S  w     a       p_{c}=cS_{w}^{-a}   where   c   c   c   is the entry capillary pressure,    1  /  a      1  a    1/a   is the pore-size distribution index and    S  w     subscript  S  w    S_{w}   is the normalized water saturation (see Relative permeability )  See also   Capillary action  Capillary number  Disjoining pressure  Leverett J-function  Young–Laplace equation  Amott test  Laplace pressure   References   Kim Kinoshita, Electrochemical Oxygen Technology p139, John Wiley & Sons, Inc. 1992.
