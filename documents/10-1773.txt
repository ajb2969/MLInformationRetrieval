   L-2-amino-4-chloropent-4-enoate dehydrochlorinase      L-2-amino-4-chloropent-4-enoate dehydrochlorinase   In enzymology , a L-2-amino-4-chloropent-4-enoate dehydrochlorinase (), an enzyme , catalyzes the chemical reaction .   L-2-amino-4-chloropent-4-enoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxopent-4-enoate + chloride + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-2-amino-4-chloropent-4-enoate and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 2-oxopent-4-enoate , chloride , and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-halide lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-2-amino-4-chloropent-4-enoate chloride-lyase (adding H 2 O deaminating; 2-oxopent-4-enoate-forming) . Other names in common use include L-2-amino-4-chloro-4-pentenoate dehalogenase , and L-2-amino-4-chloropent-4-enoate chloride-lyase (deaminating) .
