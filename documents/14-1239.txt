   Irrational winding of a torus      Irrational winding of a torus   In topology , a branch of mathematics, an irrational winding of a torus is a continuous injection of a line into a torus that is used to set up several counterexamples. 1 A related notion is the Kronecker foliation of a torus, a foliation formed by the set of all translates of a given irrational winding.  Definition  One way of constructing a torus is as the quotient space      T  2   =    ℝ  2   /   ℤ  2         superscript  T  2      superscript  ℝ  2    superscript  ℤ  2      T^{2}=\mathbb{R}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}^{2}   of a two-dimensional real vector space by the additive subgroup of integer vectors, with the corresponding projection     π  :    ℝ  2   →   T  2       normal-:  π   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  2    superscript  T  2      \pi:\mathbb{R}^{2}\to T^{2}   . Each point in the torus has as its preimage one of the translates of the square lattice    ℤ  2     superscript  ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}^{2}   in    ℝ  2     superscript  ℝ  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   , and   π   π   \pi   factors through a map that takes any point in the plane to a point in the unit square      [  0  ,  1  )   2     superscript   0  1   2    [0,1)^{2}   given by the fractional parts of the original point's Cartesian coordinates. Now consider a line in    ℝ  2     superscript  ℝ  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   given by the equation y = kx . If the slope k of the line is rational , then it can be represented by a fraction and a corresponding lattice point of    ℤ  2     superscript  ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}^{2}   . It can be shown that then the projection of this line is a simple  closed curve on a torus. If, however, k is irrational , then it will not cross any lattice points except 0, which means that its projection on the torus will not be a closed curve, and the restriction of   π   π   \pi   on this line is injective . Moreover, it can be shown that the image of this restricted projection as a subspace, called the irrational winding of a torus, is dense in the torus.  Applications  Irrational windings of a torus may be used to set up counter-examples related to monomorphisms . An irrational winding is an immersed submanifold but not a regular submanifold of the torus, which shows that the image of a manifold under a continuous injection to another manifold is not necessarily a (regular) submanifold. 2 Irrational windings are also examples of the fact that the induced submanifold topology does not have to coincide with the subspace topology of the submanifold 3   Secondly, the torus can be considered as a Lie group       U   (  1  )    ×  U    (  1  )           U  1   U   1    U(1)\times U(1)   , and the line can be considered as   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . Then it is easy to show that the image of the continuous and analytic group homomorphism     x  ↦   (   e   i  x    ,   e   i  k  x    )      maps-to  x    superscript  e    i  x     superscript  e    i  k  x       x\mapsto(e^{ix},e^{ikx})   is not a Lie subgroup 4 5 (because it's not closed in the torus – see the closed subgroup theorem ) while, of course, it is still a group. It may also be used to show that if a subgroup H of the Lie group G is not closed, the quotient G/H does not need to be a submanifold 6 and might even fail to be a Hausdorff space .
