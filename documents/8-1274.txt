Hopf manifold

In complex geometry, a Hopf manifold  is obtained as a quotient of the complex vector space (with zero deleted) 
 
 
 
  by a free action of the group

 
  of integers, with the generator 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
  acting by holomorphic contractions. Here, a holomorphic contraction is a map 
 
 
 
  such that a sufficiently big iteration 
 
 
 
  puts any given compact subset

 
  onto an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of 0.
Two dimensional Hopf manifolds are called Hopf surfaces.
Examples
In a typical situation, 
 
 
 
  is generated by a linear contraction, usually a diagonal matrix

 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  a complex number, 
 
 
 
 . Such manifold is called a classical Hopf manifold.
Properties
A Hopf manifold 
 
 
 
  is diffeomorphic to 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
 
 , it is non-Kähler. In fact, it is not even symplectic because the second cohomology group is zero.
Hypercomplex structure
Even-dimensional Hopf manifolds admit hypercomplex structure. The Hopf surface is the only compact hypercomplex manifold of quaternionic dimension 1 which is not hyperkähler.
