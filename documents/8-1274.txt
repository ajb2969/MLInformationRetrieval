   Hopf manifold      Hopf manifold   In complex geometry , a Hopf manifold is obtained as a quotient of the complex vector space (with zero deleted)    (    ℂ  n   \  0   )     normal-\   superscript  ℂ  n   0    ({\mathbb{C}}^{n}\backslash 0)   by a free action of the group     Γ  ≅  ℤ      normal-Γ  ℤ    \Gamma\cong{\mathbb{Z}}   of integers , with the generator   γ   γ   \gamma   of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   acting by holomorphic contractions . Here, a holomorphic contraction is a map    γ  :    ℂ  n   ↦   ℂ  n       normal-:  γ   maps-to   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  n      \gamma:\;{\mathbb{C}}^{n}\mapsto{\mathbb{C}}^{n}   such that a sufficiently big iteration     γ   N     superscript  γ  N    \;\gamma^{N}   puts any given compact subset     ℂ  n     superscript  ℂ  n    {\mathbb{C}}^{n}   onto an arbitrarily small neighbourhood of 0.  Two dimensional Hopf manifolds are called Hopf surfaces .  Examples  In a typical situation,   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is generated by a linear contraction, usually a diagonal matrix      q  ⋅  I   d       normal-⋅  q  I   d    q\cdot Id   , with    q  ∈  ℂ      q  ℂ    q\in{\mathbb{C}}   a complex number,    0  <   |  q  |   <  1        0    q        1     0<|q|<1   . Such manifold is called a classical Hopf manifold .  Properties  A Hopf manifold    H  :=    (    ℂ  n   \  0   )   /  ℤ      assign  H     normal-\   superscript  ℂ  n   0   ℤ     H:=({\mathbb{C}}^{n}\backslash 0)/{\mathbb{Z}}   is diffeomorphic to     S    2  n   -  1    ×   S  1        superscript  S      2  n   1     superscript  S  1     S^{2n-1}\times S^{1}   . For    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   , it is non- Kähler . In fact, it is not even symplectic because the second cohomology group is zero.  Hypercomplex structure  Even-dimensional Hopf manifolds admit hypercomplex structure . The Hopf surface is the only compact hypercomplex manifold of quaternionic dimension 1 which is not hyperkähler .  References      "  Category:Complex manifolds
