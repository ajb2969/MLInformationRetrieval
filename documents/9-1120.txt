Quasi-polynomial

In mathematics, a quasi-polynomial (pseudo-polynomial) is a generalization of polynomials. While the coefficients of a polynomial come from a ring, the coefficients of quasi-polynomials are instead periodic functions with integral period. Quasi-polynomials appear throughout much of combinatorics as the enumerators for various objects.
A quasi-polynomial can be written as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a periodic function with integral period. If 
 
 
 
  is not identically zero, then the degree of q is d. Equivalently, a function 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-polynomial if there exist polynomials 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 . The polynomials 
 
 
 
  are called the constituents of f.
Examples

Given a d-dimensional polytope P with rational vertices 
 
 
 
 , define tP to be the convex hull of 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-polynomial in t of degree d. In this case, L(P,t) is a function 
 
 
 
 . This is known as the Ehrhart quasi-polynomial, named after Eug√®ne Ehrhart.
Given two quasi-polynomials F and G, the convolution of F and G is



 
  which is a quasi-polynomial with degree
