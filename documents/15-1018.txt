   Catalase-peroxidase      Catalase-peroxidase   Catalase-peroxidase (, katG (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name donor:hydrogen-peroxide oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) donor + H 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxidized donor + 2 H 2 O  (2) 2 H 2 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   O 2 + 2 H 2 O   This enzyme is a strong catalase with H 2 O 2 as donor which releases O 2 .
