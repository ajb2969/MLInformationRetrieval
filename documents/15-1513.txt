Starch synthase (maltosyl-transferring)

Starch synthase (maltosyl-transferring) (, alpha1,4-glucan:maltose-1-P maltosyltransferase, GMPMT) is an enzyme with system name alpha-maltose 1-phosphate:(1->4)-alpha-D-glucan 4-alpha-D-maltosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

alpha-maltose 1-phosphate + [(1->4)-alpha-D-glucosyl]n 
 
 
phosphate + [(1->4)-alpha-D-glucosyl]n+2
 

The enzyme from the bacterium Mycobacterium smegmatis is specific for maltose.
