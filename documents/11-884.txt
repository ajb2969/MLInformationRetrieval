   Deacetylvindoline O-acetyltransferase      Deacetylvindoline O-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a deacetylvindoline O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + deacetylvindoline   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + vindoline   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and deacetylvindoline , whereas its two products are CoA and vindoline .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include deacetylvindoline acetyltransferase , DAT , 17-O-deacetylvindoline-17-O-acetyltransferase , acetylcoenzyme A-deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase , acetyl-CoA-17-O-deacetylvindoline 17-O-acetyltransferase , acetylcoenzyme A:deacetylvindoline 4-O-acetyltransferase , acetylcoenzyme A:deacetylvindoline O-acetyltransferase , 17-O-deacetylvindoline O-acetyltransferase , and acetyl-CoA:17-O-deacetylvindoline 17-O-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in terpene indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis.  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
