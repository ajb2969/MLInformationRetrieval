   Base change      Base change   In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry , base change refers to a number of similar theorems concerning the cohomology of sheaves on algebro-geometric objects such as varieties or schemes .  The situation of a base change theorem typically is as follows: given two maps of, say, schemes,    f  :   Y  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  Y  X     f:Y\rightarrow X   ,    g  :    X  ′   →  X      normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  X  normal-′   X     g:X^{\prime}\rightarrow X   , let    f  ′     superscript  f  normal-′    f^{\prime}   and    g  ′     superscript  g  normal-′    g^{\prime}   be the projections from the fiber product      Y  ′   :=   Y   ×  X    X  ′       assign   superscript  Y  normal-′     subscript   X   Y   superscript  X  normal-′      Y^{\prime}:=Y\times_{X}X^{\prime}   to    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   and   Y   Y   Y   , respectively. Moreover, let a sheaf   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   on X' be given. Then, there is a natural map (obtained by means of adjunction; see base change map )         f  *    R  i    g  *   ℱ   →    R  i    g  *  ′    f   ′  *    ℱ    .     normal-→     superscript  f     superscript  R  i    subscript  g    ℱ      superscript  R  i    subscript   superscript  g  normal-′      superscript  f   normal-′     ℱ     f^{*}R^{i}g_{*}\mathcal{F}\rightarrow R^{i}g^{\prime}_{*}f^{\prime*}\mathcal{F}.   Depending on the type of sheaf, and on the type of the morphisms g and f , this map is an isomorphism (of sheaves on Y ) in some cases. Here     R  i    g  *   ℱ       superscript  R  i    subscript  g    ℱ    R^{i}g_{*}\mathcal{F}   denotes the higher direct image of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   under g . As the stalk of this sheaf at a point on Y is closely related to the cohomology of the fiber of the point under g , this statement is paraphrased by saying that "cohomology commutes with base extension". 1   Flat base change for quasi-coherent sheaves  The base change holds for a quasi-coherent sheaf    ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   (on    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   ), provided that the map f is flat (together with a number of technical conditions: g needs to be a separated  morphism of finite type , the schemes involved need to be Noetherian).  Proper base change for etale sheaves  The base change holds for etale torsion sheaves, provided that g is proper . 2  Smooth base change for etale sheaves  The base change holds for etale torsion sheaves, whose torsion is prime to the residue characteristics of X , provided f is smooth and g is quasi-compact. 3  See also   Grothendieck's relative point of view in algebraic geometry  Change of base (disambiguation)  Base change lifting of automorphic forms   Notes    References      "  Category:Sheaf theory     ↩  ↩  ↩
