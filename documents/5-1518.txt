Base change

In mathematics, especially in algebraic geometry, base change refers to a number of similar theorems concerning the cohomology of sheaves on algebro-geometric objects such as varieties or schemes.
The situation of a base change theorem typically is as follows: given two maps of, say, schemes, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the projections from the fiber product

 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. Moreover, let a sheaf 
 
 
 
  on X' be given. Then, there is a natural map (obtained by means of adjunction; see base change map)


 
  Depending on the type of sheaf, and on the type of the morphisms g and f, this map is an isomorphism (of sheaves on Y) in some cases. Here 
 
 
 
  denotes the higher direct image of 
 
 
 
  under g. As the stalk of this sheaf at a point on Y is closely related to the cohomology of the fiber of the point under g, this statement is paraphrased by saying that "cohomology commutes with base extension".1 
Flat base change for quasi-coherent sheaves
The base change holds for a quasi-coherent sheaf

 
  (on 
 
 
 
 ), provided that the map f is flat (together with a number of technical conditions: g needs to be a separated morphism of finite type, the schemes involved need to be Noetherian).
Proper base change for etale sheaves
The base change holds for etale torsion sheaves, provided that g is proper.2
Smooth base change for etale sheaves
The base change holds for etale torsion sheaves, whose torsion is prime to the residue characteristics of X, provided f is smooth and g is quasi-compact.3
