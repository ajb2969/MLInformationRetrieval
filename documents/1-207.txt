Conjunction introduction

Conjunction introduction (often abbreviated simply as conjunction and also called and introduction123) is a valid rule of inference of propositional logic. The rule makes it possible to introduce a conjunction into a logical proof. It is the inference that if the proposition p is true, and proposition q is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions p and q is true. For example, if it's true that it's raining, and it's true that I'm inside, then it's true that "it's raining and I'm inside". The rule can be stated:



where the rule is that wherever an instance of "
 
 
 
 " and "
 
 
 
 " appear on lines of a proof, a "
 
 
 
 " can be placed on a subsequent line.
Formal notation
The conjunction introduction rule may be written in sequent notation:



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are each on lines of a proof in some logical system;
where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
