   Conjunction introduction      Conjunction introduction   Conjunction introduction (often abbreviated simply as conjunction and also called and introduction 1 2 3 ) is a valid  rule of inference of propositional logic . The rule makes it possible to introduce a conjunction into a logical proof . It is the inference that if the proposition  p is true, and proposition q is true, then the logical conjunction of the two propositions p and q is true. For example, if it's true that it's raining, and it's true that I'm inside, then it's true that "it's raining and I'm inside". The rule can be stated:       P  ,  Q     ∴   P  and  Q         P  Q    therefore  absent    P  italic- and  Q      \frac{P,Q}{\therefore P\and Q}     where the rule is that wherever an instance of "   P   P   P   " and "   Q   Q   Q   " appear on lines of a proof, a "    P  and  Q      P  italic- and  Q    P\and Q   " can be placed on a subsequent line.  Formal notation  The conjunction introduction rule may be written in sequent notation:       P  ,  Q   ⊢   P  and  Q      proves   P  Q     P  italic- and  Q     P,Q\vdash P\and Q     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical  symbol meaning that    P  and  Q      P  italic- and  Q    P\and Q   is a syntactic consequence if   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   are each on lines of a proof in some logical system ;  where   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   are propositions expressed in some formal system .
