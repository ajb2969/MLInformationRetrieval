   Mannitol 2-dehydrogenase      Mannitol 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a mannitol 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-mannitol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-fructose + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-mannitol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are D-fructose , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannitol:NAD + 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include D-mannitol dehydrogenase , and mannitol dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
