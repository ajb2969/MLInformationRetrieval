   Alkylacetylglycerophosphatase      Alkylacetylglycerophosphatase   In enzymology , an alkylacetylglycerophosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include 1-alkyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-P:acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase , and alkylacetylglycerophosphate phosphatase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism .
