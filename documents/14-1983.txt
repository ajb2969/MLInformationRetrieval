Multivariate Pareto distribution

In statistics, a multivariate Pareto distribution is a multivariate extension of a univariate Pareto distribution.1
There are several different types of univariate Pareto distributions including Pareto Types I−IV and Feller−Pareto.2 Multivariate Pareto distributions have been defined for many of these types.
Bivariate Pareto distributions
Bivariate Pareto distribution of the first kind
Mardia (1962)3 defined a bivariate distribution with cumulative distribution function (CDF) given by



and joint density function


 
  The marginal distributions are Pareto Type 1 with density functions



The means and variances of the marginal distributions are


 
  and for a > 2, X1 and X2 are positively correlated with



Bivariate Pareto distribution of the second kind
Arnold4 suggests representing the bivariate Pareto Type I complementary CDF by


 
  If the location and scale parameter are allowed to differ, the complementary CDF is



which has Pareto Type II univariate marginal distributions. This distribution is called a multivariate Pareto distribution of type II by Arnold.5 (This definition is not equivalent to Mardia's bivariate Pareto distribution of the second kind.)6
For a > 1, the marginal means are


 
  while for a > 2, the variances, covariance, and correlation are the same as for multivariate Pareto of the first kind.
Multivariate Pareto distributions
Multivariate Pareto distribution of the first kind
Mardia's7 Multivariate Pareto distribution of the First Kind has the joint probability density function given by



The marginal distributions have the same form as (1), and the one-dimensional marginal distributions have a Pareto Type I distribution. The complementary CDF is



The marginal means and variances are given by


 
  If a > 2 the covariances and correlations are positive with



Multivariate Pareto distribution of the second kind
Arnold8 suggests representing the multivariate Pareto Type I complementary CDF by


 
  If the location and scale parameter are allowed to differ, the complementary CDF is



which has marginal distributions of the same type (3) and Pareto Type II univariate marginal distributions. This distribution is called a multivariate Pareto distribution of type II by Arnold.9
For a > 1, the marginal means are


 
  while for a > 2, the variances, covariances, and correlations are the same as for multivariate Pareto of the first kind.
Multivariate Pareto distribution of the fourth kind
A random vector X has a k-dimensional multivariate Pareto distribution of the Fourth Kind10 if its joint survival function is


 
  The k1-dimensional marginal distributions (''k1 X_i = \mu_i + (W_i / Z)^{\gamma_i}, \qquad i=1,\dots,k, \qquad (5)  where


 
  are independent gamma variables.11 The marginal distributions and conditional distributions are of the same type (5); that is, they are multivariate Feller–Pareto distributions. The one–dimensional marginal distributions are of Feller−Pareto type.
