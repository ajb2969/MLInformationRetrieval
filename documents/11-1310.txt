Lipopolysaccharide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase

In enzymology, a lipopolysaccharide N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + lipopolysaccharide 
 
 
 
  UDP + N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyllipopolysaccharide
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and lipopolysaccharide, whereas its two products are UDP and N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyllipopolysaccharide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:lipopolysaccharide N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP-N-acetylglucosamine-lipopolysaccharide, N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase, uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-lipopolysaccharide, and acetylglucosaminyltransferase. This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2.
