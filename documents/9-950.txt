Exner function

The Exner function is an important parameter in atmospheric modeling. The Exner function can be viewed as non-dimensionalized pressure and can be defined as:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the pressure at the surface, usually taken as 1000 hPa; 
 
 
 
  is the gas constant for dry air; 
 
 
 
  is the heat capacity of dry air at constant pressure; 
 
 
 
  is the absolute temperature; and 
 
 
 
  is the potential temperature.
