   Exner function      Exner function   The Exner function is an important parameter in atmospheric modeling . The Exner function can be viewed as non-dimensionalized pressure and can be defined as:      Π  =    (   p   p  0    )     R  d   /   c  p     =   T  θ         normal-Π   superscript    p   subscript  p  0       subscript  R  d    subscript  c  p            T  θ      \Pi=\left(\frac{p}{p_{0}}\right)^{R_{d}/c_{p}}=\frac{T}{\theta}   where    p  0     subscript  p  0    p_{0}   is the pressure at the surface , usually taken as 1000 hPa ;    R  d     subscript  R  d    R_{d}   is the gas constant for dry air;    c  p     subscript  c  p    c_{p}   is the heat capacity of dry air at constant pressure;   T   T   T   is the absolute temperature ; and   θ   θ   \theta   is the potential temperature .
