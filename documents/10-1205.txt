D-sorbitol dehydrogenase (acceptor)




D-sorbitol dehydrogenase (acceptor)

In enzymology, a D-sorbitol dehydrogenase (acceptor) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-sorbitol + acceptor 
 
 
 
  L-sorbose + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-sorbitol and acceptor, whereas its two products are L-sorbose and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-sorbitol:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called D-sorbitol:(acceptor) 1-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
