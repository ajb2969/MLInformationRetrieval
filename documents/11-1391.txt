Zeatin O-beta-D-xylosyltransferase




Zeatin O-beta-D-xylosyltransferase

In enzymology, a zeatin O-beta-D-xylosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-D-xylose + zeatin 
 
 
 
  UDP + O-beta-D-xylosylzeatin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-D-xylose and zeatin, whereas its two products are UDP and O-beta-D-xylosylzeatin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-xylose:zeatin O-beta-D-xylosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoxylose-zeatin xylosyltransferase, and zeatin O-xylosyltransferase.
