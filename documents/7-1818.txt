   Passive integrator circuit      Passive integrator circuit     Passive integrator circuit is a simple four-terminal network consisting of two passive elements. It is also the simplest (first-order) low-pass filter .  We'll analyze only the first circuit; the second is very similar.  Transfer function  A transfer ratio is a gain factor for the sinusoidal input signal with given frequency.  A transfer function shows the dependence of the transfer ratio from the signal frequency, given that the input signal is sinusoidal.  According to Ohm's law ,        Y  =   X    Z  C     Z  C   +   Z  R      =   X    1   j  ω  C      1   j  ω  C    +  R     =   X   1   1  +   j  ω  R  C       ,        Y    X     subscript  Z  C      subscript  Z  C    subscript  Z  R             X      1    j  ω  C        1    j  ω  C    R            X    1    1    j  ω  R  C         Y=X\frac{Z_{C}}{Z_{C}+Z_{R}}=X\frac{\frac{1}{j\omega C}}{\frac{1}{j\omega C}+R%
 }=X\frac{1}{1+j\omega RC},      where   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   are input and output signals' amplitudes respectively, and    Z  R     subscript  Z  R    Z_{R}   and    Z  C     subscript  Z  C    Z_{C}   are the resistor's and capacitor's  impedances . Therefore, the complex transfer function is         K   (   j  ω   )    =   1   1  +   j  ω  R  C     =   1   1  +    j  ω    ω  0       ,          K    j  ω      1    1    j  ω  R  C            1    1      j  ω    subscript  ω  0         K(j\omega)=\frac{1}{1+j\omega RC}=\frac{1}{1+\frac{j\omega}{\omega_{0}}},      where         ω  0   =   1   R  C     .       subscript  ω  0     1    R  C      \omega_{0}=\frac{1}{RC}.      Amplitude transfer function         H   (  ω  )    =   |   K   (   j  ω   )    |   =   1    1  +    (   ω   ω  0    )   2       .          H  ω       K    j  ω            1      1   superscript    ω   subscript  ω  0    2         H(\omega)=|K(j\omega)|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)%
 ^{2}}}.      Phase transfer function         ϕ   (  ω  )    =    arg  K    (   j  ω   )    =   -   arctan   ω   ω  0       .          ϕ  ω       K     j  ω               ω   subscript  ω  0         \phi(\omega)=\arg K(j\omega)=-\arctan\frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}.      (Figure)  Amplitude and phase transfer functions for a passive integrator circuit   Transfer functions for the second circuit are the same (with     ω  0   =   R  L        subscript  ω  0     R  L     \omega_{0}=\frac{R}{L}   ).  Impulse response  The circuit's Impulse response can be derived as an inverse Laplace transform of the complex transfer function:         h   (  t  )    =    ℒ   -  1     {   K   (  p  )    }    =    ∫   β  -   j  ∞     β  +   j  ∞      K   (  p  )     e   p  t     d  p    =    ω  0    e   -    ω  0   t      =    1  τ    e   -   t  τ       ,          h  t      superscript  ℒ    1       K  p            superscript   subscript     β    j        β    j        K  p   superscript  e    p  t    d  p            subscript  ω  0    superscript  e       subscript  ω  0   t               1  τ    superscript  e      t  τ         h(t)=\mathcal{L}^{-1}\left\{K(p)\right\}=\int_{\beta-j\infty}^{\beta+j\infty}K%
 (p)e^{pt}\,dp=\omega_{0}e^{-\omega_{0}t}=\frac{1}{\tau}e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}},      where    τ  =   1   ω  0        τ    1   subscript  ω  0      \tau=\frac{1}{\omega_{0}}   is a time constant.
