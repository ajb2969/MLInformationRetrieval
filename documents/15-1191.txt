3-Oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehyde dehydrogenase

3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehyde dehydrogenase (, paaZ (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA semialdehyde + NADP+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  3-oxo-5,6-dehydrosuberyl-CoA + NADPH + H+


The enzyme from Escherichia coli is a bifunctional protein that also acts as EC 3.7.1.16, oxepin-CoA hydrolase.
