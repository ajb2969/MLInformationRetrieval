   Brauer–Siegel theorem      Brauer–Siegel theorem   In mathematics , the Brauer–Siegel theorem , named after Richard Brauer and Carl Ludwig Siegel , is an asymptotic result on the behaviour of algebraic number fields , obtained by Richard Brauer and Carl Ludwig Siegel . It attempts to generalise the results known on the class numbers of imaginary quadratic fields , to a more general sequence of number fields        K  1   ,   K  2   ,  …   .      subscript  K  1    subscript  K  2   normal-…    K_{1},K_{2},\ldots.     In all cases other than the rational field Q and imaginary quadratic fields, the regulator  R i of K i must be taken into account, because K i then has units of infinite order by Dirichlet's unit theorem . The quantitative hypothesis of the standard Brauer–Siegel theorem is that if D i is the discriminant of K i , then         [    K  i   :  Q   ]    log   |   D  i   |     →   0  as  i   →  ∞   .       normal-→     delimited-[]   normal-:   subscript  K  i   Q         subscript  D  i        0  as  i     normal-→        \frac{[K_{i}:Q]}{\log|D_{i}|}\to 0\text{ as }i\to\infty.     Assuming that, and the algebraic hypothesis that K i is a Galois extension of Q , the conclusion is that        log   (    h  i    R  i    )     log    |   D  i   |      →   1  as  i   →  ∞       normal-→         subscript  h  i    subscript  R  i            subscript  D  i         1  as  i     normal-→        \frac{\log(h_{i}R_{i})}{\log\sqrt{|D_{i}|}}\to 1\text{ as }i\to\infty     where h i is the class number of K i .  This result is ineffective , as indeed was the result on quadratic fields on which it built. Effective results in the same direction were initiated in work of Harold Stark from the early 1970s.
