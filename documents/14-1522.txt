   György Paál      György Paál   György Paál ( Budapest , 1934 – Budapest, 1992) 1 was a Hungarian  astronomer and cosmologist .  Work  In the late 50-s Paál studied the quasar and galaxy cluster distributions. In 1970 from redshift quantization he came up with the idea that the Universe might has nontrivial topological structure. 2  In 1992, G. Paal, et al.  3 and A. Holba, et al.  4 reanalyzed the redshift data from a fairly large sample of galaxies and concluded that there was an unexplained periodicity of redshifts.  From the observed galaxy distribution in 1992 Paal et al. 5 suggested non zero cosmological constant . Two years later in another paper 6 they suggested     Ω  Λ   ≃   2  /  3      similar-to-or-equals   subscript  normal-Ω  normal-Λ     2  3     \Omega_{\Lambda}\simeq 2/3   . 7 Later observations confirmed this value. 8  Membership  Cosmological Committee of IAU 9  Awards  László Detre award.
