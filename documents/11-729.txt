   Hippurate hydrolase      Hippurate hydrolase   In enzymology , a hippurate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   hippurate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzoate + glycine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are hippurate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are benzoate and glycine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-benzoylamino-acid amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism .
