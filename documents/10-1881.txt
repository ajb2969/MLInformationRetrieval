   2,6-dioxo-6-phenylhexa-3-enoate hydrolase      2,6-dioxo-6-phenylhexa-3-enoate hydrolase   In enzymology , a 2,6-dioxo-6-phenylhexa-3-enoate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,6-dioxo-6-phenylhexa-3-enoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzoate + 2-oxopent-4-enoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2,6-dioxo-6-phenylhexa-3-enoate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are benzoate and 2-oxopent-4-enoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carbon-carbon bonds in ketonic substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,6-dioxo-6-phenylhexa-3-enoate benzoylhydrolase . This enzyme is also called HOHPDA hydrolase . This enzyme participates in biphenyl degradation and fluorene degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
