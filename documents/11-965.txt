   Phosphatidylcholine—retinol O-acyltransferase      Phosphatidylcholine—retinol O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a phosphatidylcholine---retinol O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phosphatidylcholine + retinol---[cellular-retinol-binding-protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-acylglycerophosphocholine + retinyl-ester---[cellular-retinol-binding-protein]   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphatidylcholine and retinol---[cellular-retinol-binding-protein ], whereas its two products are 2-acylglycerophosphocholine and retinyl-ester---[cellular-retinol-binding-protein ].  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphatidylcholine:retinol---[cellular-retinol-binding-protein] O-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include lecithin---retinol acyltransferase , phosphatidylcholine:retinol-(cellular-retinol-binding-protein) , and O-acyltransferase .
