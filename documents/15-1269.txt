TRNA (cytidine32/uridine32-2'-O)-methyltransferase

TRNA (cytidine32/uridine32-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, YfhQ, tRNA:Cm32/Um32 methyltransferase, TrMet(Xm32), TrmJ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytidine32/uridine32-2'-O)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine32 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine32 in tRNA
 
(2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uridine32 in tRNA 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyluridine32 in tRNA
 

In Escherichia coli YfhQ is the only methyltransferase responsible for the formation of 2'-O-methylcytidine32 in tRNA.
