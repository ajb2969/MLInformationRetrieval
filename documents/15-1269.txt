   TRNA (cytidine32/uridine32-2'-O)-methyltransferase      TRNA (cytidine32/uridine32-2'-O)-methyltransferase   TRNA (cytidine 32 /uridine 32 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, YfhQ , tRNA:Cm 32 /Um 32 methyltransferase , TrMet(Xm 32 ) , TrmJ ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytidine 32 /uridine 32 -2'-O)-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine 32 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine 32 in tRNA  (2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + uridine 32 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyluridine32 in tRNA   In Escherichia coli YfhQ is the only methyltransferase responsible for the formation of 2'-O-methylcytidine32 in tRNA.
