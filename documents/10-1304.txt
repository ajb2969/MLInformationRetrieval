   Long-chain-fatty-acyl-CoA reductase      Long-chain-fatty-acyl-CoA reductase   In enzymology , a long-chain-fatty-acyl-CoA reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a long-chain aldehyde + CoA + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a long-chain acyl-CoA + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are long-chain aldehyde , CoA , and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are long-chain acyl-CoA , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is long-chain-aldehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase (acyl-CoA-forming) . Other names in common use include acyl-CoA reductase , and acyl coenzyme A reductase .
