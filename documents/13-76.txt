   Verbal subgroup      Verbal subgroup   In mathematics , especially in the area of abstract algebra known as group theory , a verbal subgroup is any subgroup of a group definable as the subgroup generated by the set of all elements formed by choices of elements for a given set of words . For example, given the word xy , the corresponding verbal subgroup of    {   x  y   }       x  y     \{xy\}   would be generated by the set of all products of two elements in the group, substituting any element for x and any element for y , and hence would be the group itself. On the other hand the verbal subgroup of    {   x  2   ,   x   y  2    x   -  1     }      superscript  x  2     x   superscript  y  2    superscript  x    1       \{x^{2},xy^{2}x^{-1}\}   would be generated by the set of squares and their conjugates . Verbal subgroups are particularly important as the only fully characteristic subgroups of a free group and therefore represent the generic example of fully characteristic subgroups, .
