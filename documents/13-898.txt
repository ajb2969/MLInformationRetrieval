Kostant partition function

In representation theory, a branch of mathematics, the Kostant partition function, introduced by , of a root system

 
  is the number of ways one can represent a vector (weight) as an integral non-negative sum of the positive roots

 
 . Kostant used it to rewrite the Weyl character formula for the multiplicity of a weight of an irreducible representation of a semisimple Lie algebra.
The Kostant partition function can also be defined for Kacâ€“Moody algebras and has similar properties.
Relation to the Weyl character formula
The values of Kostant's partition function are given by the coefficients of the power series expansion of



where the product is over all positive roots. Using Weyl's denominator formula



shows that the Weyl character formula



can also be written as



This allows the multiplicities of finite-dimensional irreducible representations in Weyl's character formula to be written as a finite sum involving values of the Kostant partition function, as these are the coefficients of the power series expansion of the denominator of the right hand side.
