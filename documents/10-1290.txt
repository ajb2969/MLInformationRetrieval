   Glutamyl-tRNA reductase      Glutamyl-tRNA reductase   A glutamyl-tRNA reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamate 1-semialdehyde + NADP + + tRNAGlu   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-glutamyl-tRNAGlu + NADPH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamate 1-semialdehyde , NADP + , and tRNA(Glu) , whereas its 3 products are L-glutamyl-tRNA(Glu) , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , to be specific, those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate-semialdehyde: NADP+ oxidoreductase (L-glutamyl-tRNAGlu-forming) . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
