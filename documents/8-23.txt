Bitopological space

In mathematics, a bitopological space is a set endowed with two topologies. Typically, if the set is 
 
 
 
  and the topologies are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then the bitopological space is referred to as 
 
 
 
 .
Continuity
A map

 
  from a bitopological space 
 
 
 
  to another bitopological space 
 
 
 
  is called continuous or sometimes pairwise continuous if 
 
 
 
  is continuous both as a map from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and as map from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
Bitopological variants of topological properties
Corresponding to well-known properties of topological spaces, there are versions for bitopological spaces.

A bitopological space 
 
 
 
  is pairwise compact if each cover 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , contains a finite subcover. In this case, 
 
 
 
  must contain at least one member from 
 
 
 
  and at least one member from 
 
 

A bitopological space 
 
 
 
  is pairwise Hausdorff if for any two distinct points 
 
 
 
  there exist disjoint 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
A bitopological space 
 
 
 
  is pairwise zero-dimensional if opens in 
 
 
 
  which are closed in 
 
 
 
  form a basis for 
 
 
 
 , and opens in 
 
 
 
  which are closed in 
 
 
 
  form a basis for 
 
 
 
 .
A bitopological space 
 
 
 
  is called binormal if for every 
 
 

 
 -closed and 
 
 

 
 -closed sets there are 
 
 

 
 -open and 
 
 

 
 -open sets such that 
 
 

 
 , and
