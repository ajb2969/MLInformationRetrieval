   Linear response function      Linear response function   A linear response function describes the input-output relationship of a signal transducer such as a radio turning electromagnetic waves into music or a neuron turning synaptic input into a response. Because of its many applications in information theory , physics and engineering there exist alternative names for specific linear response functions such as susceptibility , impulse response or impedance , see also transfer function . The concept of a Green's function or fundamental solution of an ordinary differential equation is closely related.  Mathematical definition  Denote the input of a system by    h   (  t  )       h  t    h(t)   (e.g. a force ), and the response of the system by    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   (e.g. a position). Generally, the value of    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   will depend not only on the present value of    h   (  t  )       h  t    h(t)   , but also on past values. Approximately    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   is a weighted sum of the previous values of    h   (   t  ′   )       h   superscript  t  normal-′     h(t^{\prime})   , with the weights given by the linear response function    χ   (   t  -   t  ′    )       χ    t   superscript  t  normal-′      \chi(t-t^{\prime})   :        x   (  t  )    =     ∫   -  ∞   t    d    t  ′    χ   (   t  -   t  ′    )   h   (   t  ′   )     +   …     .        x  t       superscript   subscript        t     d   superscript  t  normal-′   χ    t   superscript  t  normal-′    h   superscript  t  normal-′     normal-…     x(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{t}dt^{\prime}\,\chi(t-t^{\prime})h(t^{\prime})+\dots\,.     The explicit term on the r.h.s. is the leading order term of a Volterra expansion for the full nonlinear response. If the system in question is highly non-linear, higher order terms in the expansion, denoted by the dots, become important and the signal transducer can not adequately be described just by its linear response function.  The complex-valued Fourier transform      χ  ~    (  ω  )        normal-~  χ   ω    \tilde{\chi}(\omega)   of the linear response function is very useful as it describes the output of the system if the input is a sine wave     h   (  t  )    =    h  0   ⋅   sin   (   ω  t   )           h  t    normal-⋅   subscript  h  0       ω  t       h(t)=h_{0}\cdot\sin(\omega t)   with frequency   ω   ω   \omega   . The output reads        x   (  t  )    =    |    χ  ~    (  ω  )    |   ⋅   h  0   ⋅   sin   (    ω  t   +    arg   χ  ~     (  ω  )     )      ,        x  t    normal-⋅       normal-~  χ   ω     subscript  h  0         ω  t        normal-~  χ    ω        x(t)=|\tilde{\chi}(\omega)|\cdot h_{0}\cdot\sin(\omega t+\arg\tilde{\chi}(%
 \omega))\,,     with amplitude gain     |    χ  ~    (  ω  )    |         normal-~  χ   ω     |\tilde{\chi}(\omega)|   and phase shift      arg   χ  ~     (  ω  )          normal-~  χ    ω    \arg\tilde{\chi}(\omega)   .  Example  Consider a damped harmonic oscillator with input given by an external driving force    h   (  t  )       h  t    h(t)   ,          x  ¨    (  t  )    +   γ   x  ˙    (  t  )    +    ω  0  2   x   (  t  )     =   h   (  t  )     .           normal-¨  x   t     γ   normal-˙  x   t      superscript   subscript  ω  0   2   x  t      h  t     \ddot{x}(t)+\gamma\dot{x}(t)+\omega_{0}^{2}x(t)=h(t).\,     The complex-valued Fourier transform of the linear response function is given by         χ  ~    (  ω  )    =     x  ~    (  ω  )      h  ~    (  ω  )     =   1     ω  0  2   -   ω  2    +   i  γ  ω      .           normal-~  χ   ω        normal-~  x   ω      normal-~  h   ω           1       superscript   subscript  ω  0   2    superscript  ω  2      i  γ  ω        \tilde{\chi}(\omega)=\frac{\tilde{x}(\omega)}{\tilde{h}(\omega)}=\frac{1}{%
 \omega_{0}^{2}-\omega^{2}+i\gamma\omega}.\,     The amplitude gain is given by the magnitude of the complex number      χ  ~    (  ω  )    ,       normal-~  χ   ω    \tilde{\chi}(\omega),   and the phase shift by the arctan of the imaginary part of the function, divided by the real one.  From this representation, we see that for small   γ   γ   \gamma   the Fourier transform     χ  ~    (  ω  )        normal-~  χ   ω    \tilde{\chi}(\omega)   of the linear response function yields a pronounced maximum (" Resonance ") at the frequency    ω  ≈   ω  0       ω   subscript  ω  0     \omega\approx\omega_{0}   . The linear response function for a harmonic oscillator is mathematically identical to that of an RLC circuit . The width of the maximum    ,  Δ  ω  ,     fragments  normal-,  Δ  ω  normal-,    ,\Delta\omega,   typically is much smaller than     ω  0   ,     subscript  ω  0    \omega_{0},   so that the Quality factor     S  :=     ω  0   /  Δ   ω      assign  S       subscript  ω  0   normal-Δ   ω     S:=\omega_{0}/\Delta\omega   can be extremely large.  Kubo formula  The exposition of linear response theory, in the context of quantum statistics , can be found in a paper by Ryogo Kubo . 1 This defines particularly the Kubo formula , which considers the general case that the "force" h(t) is a perturbation of the basic operator of the system, the Hamiltonian ,      H  ^   0   →     H  ^   0   -   h   (   t  ′   )    B  ^    (   t  ′   )        normal-→   subscript   normal-^  H   0      subscript   normal-^  H   0     h   superscript  t  normal-′    normal-^  B    superscript  t  normal-′       \hat{H}_{0}\to\hat{H}_{0}-h(t^{\prime})\hat{B}(t^{\prime})\,   where    B  ^     normal-^  B    \hat{B}   corresponds to a measurable quantity as input, while the output x(t) is the perturbation of the thermal expectation of another measurable quantity      A  ^    (  t  )    .       normal-^  A   t    \hat{A}(t).   . The Kubo formula then defines the quantum-statistical calculation of the susceptibility     χ   (   t  -   t  ′    )       χ    t   superscript  t  normal-′      \chi(t-t^{\prime})   by a general formula involving only the mentioned operators.  As a consequence of the principle of causality the complex-valued function     χ  ~    (  ω  )        normal-~  χ   ω    \tilde{\chi}(\omega)   has poles only in the lower half-plane. This leads to the Kramers-Kronig relations , which relates the real and the imaginary parts of     χ  ~    (  ω  )        normal-~  χ   ω    \tilde{\chi}(\omega)   by integration. The simplest example is once more the damped harmonic oscillator . 2  See also   Convolution  Green–Kubo relations  Fluctuation theorem  Dispersion (optics)  Lindblad equation  Semilinear response   References    External links   Linear Response Functions in Eva Pavarini, Erik Koch, Dieter Vollhardt, and Alexander Lichtenstein (eds.): DMFT at 25: Infinite Dimensions, Verlag des Forschungszentrum Jülich, 2014 ISBN 978-3-89336-953-9   "  Category:Concepts in physics     Kubo, R., Statistical Mechanical Theory of Irreversible Processes I , Journal of the Physical Society of Japan, vol. 12 , pp. 570–586 (1957). ↩  De Clozeaux, Linear Response Theory , in: E.
