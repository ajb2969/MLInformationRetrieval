Exact C*-algebra

In mathematics, an exact C*-algebra is a C*-algebra that preserves exact sequences under the minimum tensor product.
Definition
A C*-algebra E is exact if, for any short exact sequence,



the sequence



where âŠ—min denotes the minimum tensor product, is also exact.
Properties
Exact C*-algebras have the following equivalent characterizations:

A C*-algebra A is exact if and only if A is nuclearly embeddable into B(H), the C*-algebra of all bounded operators on a Hilbert space H.
A separable C*-algebra A is exact if and only if it is isomorphic to a subalgebra of the Cuntz algebra

 
 .

All nuclear C*-algebras and their C*-subalgebras are exact.
