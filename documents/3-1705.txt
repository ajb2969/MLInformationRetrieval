   Hilbert transform      Hilbert transform   In mathematics and in signal processing , the Hilbert transform is a linear operator which takes a function, u ( t ), and produces a function, H ( u )( t ), with the same domain . The Hilbert transform is important in the field of signal processing where it is used to derive the analytic representation of a signal u ( t ). This means that the real signal u ( t ) is extended into the complex plane such that it satisfies the Cauchy-Riemann equations . For example, the Hilbert transform leads to the harmonic conjugate of a given function in Fourier analysis , aka harmonic analysis . Equivalently, it is an example of a singular integral operator and of a Fourier multiplier .  The Hilbert transform was originally defined for periodic functions , or equivalently for functions on the circle , in which case it is given by convolution with the Hilbert kernel . More commonly, however, the Hilbert transform refers to a convolution with the Cauchy kernel , for functions defined on the real line  R (the boundary of the upper half-plane ). The Hilbert transform is closely related to the Paley–Wiener theorem , another result relating holomorphic functions in the upper half-plane and Fourier transforms of functions on the real line.  The Hilbert transform is named after David Hilbert , who first introduced the operator in order to solve a special case of the Riemann–Hilbert problem for holomorphic functions .  Introduction  The Hilbert transform of u can be thought of as the convolution of u ( t ) with the function h ( t ) = 1/(π t ). Because h ( t ) is not integrable , the integrals defining the convolution do not converge. Instead, the Hilbert transform is defined using the Cauchy principal value (denoted here by p.v.). Explicitly, the Hilbert transform of a function (or signal) u ( t ) is given by:       H   (  u  )    (  t  )    =   p.v.    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    u   (  τ  )   h   (   t  -  τ   )   d  τ     =     1  π    p.v.    ∫   -  ∞   ∞       u   (  τ  )     t  -  τ     d  τ             H  u  t     p.v.    superscript   subscript            u  τ  h    t  τ   d  τ              1  π   p.v.    superscript   subscript                u  τ     t  τ    d  τ        H(u)(t)=\text{p.v.}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u(\tau)h(t-\tau)\,d\tau=\frac{1}{\pi%
 }\ \text{p.v.}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{u(\tau)}{t-\tau}\,d\tau     provided this integral exists as a principal value. This is precisely the convolution of u with the tempered distribution p.v. 1/π t (due to ; see ). Alternatively, by changing variables, the principal value integral can be written explicitly  as:        H   (  u  )    (  t  )    =   -    1  π     lim   ε  →  0      ∫  ε  ∞        u   (   t  +  τ   )    -   u   (   t  -  τ   )     τ    d  τ        .        H  u  t         1  π     subscript    normal-→  ε  0      superscript   subscript   ε             u    t  τ      u    t  τ     τ   d  τ         H(u)(t)=-\frac{1}{\pi}\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0}\int_{\varepsilon}^{%
 \infty}\frac{u(t+\tau)-u(t-\tau)}{\tau}\,d\tau.     When the Hilbert transform is applied twice in succession to a function u , the result is negative u :       H   (   H   (  u  )    )    (  t  )    =   -   u   (  t  )           H    H  u   t       u  t      H(H(u))(t)=-u(t)     provided the integrals defining both iterations converge in a suitable sense. In particular, the inverse transform is − H . This fact can most easily be seen by considering the effect of the Hilbert transform on the Fourier transform of u ( t ) (see Relationship with the Fourier transform , below).  For an analytic function in upper half-plane , the Hilbert transform describes the relationship between the real part and the imaginary part of the boundary values. That is, if f ( z ) is analytic in the plane Im z > 0 and u ( t ) = Re f ( t + 0· i ) then Im f ( t + 0· i ) = H ( u )( t ) up to an additive constant, provided this Hilbert transform exists.  Notation  In signal processing the Hilbert transform of u ( t ) is commonly denoted by     u  ^    (  t  )        normal-^  u   t    \widehat{u}(t)\,   (e.g., ). However, in mathematics, this notation is already extensively used to denote the Fourier transform of u ( t ) (e.g., ). Occasionally, the Hilbert transform may be denoted by     u  ~    (  t  )        normal-~  u   t    \tilde{u}(t)   . Furthermore, many sources define the Hilbert transform as the negative of the one defined here (e.g., ).  History  The Hilbert transform arose in Hilbert's 1905 work on a problem posed by Riemann concerning analytic functions (; ) which has come to be known as the Riemann–Hilbert problem . Hilbert's work was mainly concerned with the Hilbert transform for functions defined on the circle (; ). Some of his earlier work related to the Discrete Hilbert Transform dates back to lectures he gave in Göttingen. The results were later published by Hermann Weyl in his dissertation . Schur improved Hilbert's results about the discrete Hilbert transform and extended them to the integral case . These results were restricted to the spaces L 2 and ℓ 2 . In 1928, Marcel Riesz proved that the Hilbert transform can be defined for u in L p ( R ) for 1 ≤ p p ( R ) for 1 H (ω) = − i'' sgn(ω) where sgn is the signum function . Therefore:       ℱ   (   H   (  u  )    )    (  ω  )    =     (   -    i    sgn   (  ω  )      )   ⋅  ℱ    (  u  )    (  ω  )          ℱ    H  u   ω      normal-⋅      i   sgn  ω     ℱ   u  ω     \mathcal{F}(H(u))(\omega)=(-i\,\operatorname{sgn}(\omega))\cdot\mathcal{F}(u)(\omega)     where   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   denotes the Fourier transform . Since sgn( x ) = sgn(2π x ), it follows that this result applies to the three common definitions of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   .  By Euler's formula ,        σ  H    (  ω  )    =   {       i  =   e   +    i  π   2      ,       for  ω   <  0        0  ,       for  ω   =  0          -  i   =   e   -    i  π   2      ,       for  ω   >  0              subscript  σ  H   ω    cases    i   superscript  e        i  π   2          for  ω   0   0      for  ω   0       i    superscript  e        i  π   2          for  ω   0      \sigma_{H}(\omega)=\begin{cases}i=e^{+\frac{i\pi}{2}},&\mbox{for }\omega<0\\
 0,&\mbox{for }\omega=0\\
 -i=e^{-\frac{i\pi}{2}},&\mbox{for }\omega>0\end{cases}     Therefore H ( u )( t ) has the effect of shifting the phase of the negative frequency components of u ( t ) by +90° (π/2 radians) and the phase of the positive frequency components by −90°. And i · H ( u )( t ) has the effect of restoring the positive frequency components while shifting the negative frequency ones an additional +90°, resulting in their negation.  When the Hilbert transform is applied twice, the phase of the negative and positive frequency components of u ( t ) are respectively shifted by +180° and −180°, which are equivalent amounts. The signal is negated; i.e., H ( H ( u )) = − u , because:         (    σ  H    (  ω  )    )   2   =   e   ±   i  π     =   -  1      for  ω   ≠  0      formulae-sequence       superscript     subscript  σ  H   ω   2    superscript  e   plus-or-minus    i  π            1         for  ω   0     \big(\sigma_{H}(\omega)\big)^{2}=e^{\pm i\pi}=-1\qquad\text{for }\omega\neq 0     Table of selected Hilbert transforms      Signal     u   (  t  )       u  t    u(t)\,      Hilbert transform 1     H   (  u  )    (  t  )       H  u  t    H(u)(t)              sin   (  t  )       t    \sin(t)    2       -   cos   (  t  )          t     -\cos(t)            cos   (  t  )       t    \cos(t)    3       sin   (  t  )       t    \sin(t)\,            exp   (   i  t   )         i  t     \exp\left(it\right)          -   i   exp   (   i  t   )           i      i  t       -i\exp\left(it\right)            exp   (   -   i  t    )           i  t      \exp\left(-it\right)          i   exp   (   -   i  t    )        i        i  t       i\exp\left(-it\right)            1    t  2   +  1       1     superscript  t  2   1     1\over t^{2}+1          t    t  2   +  1       t     superscript  t  2   1     t\over t^{2}+1            e   -   t  2       superscript  e     superscript  t  2      e^{-t^{2}}          2   π   -   1  /  2     F   (  t  )       2   superscript  π      1  2     F  t    2\pi^{-1/2}F(t)   see Dawson function     Sinc function      sin   (  t  )    t        t   t    \sin(t)\over t           1  -   cos   (  t  )     t        1    t    t    1-\cos(t)\over t        Rectangular function     ⊓   (  t  )      square-intersection  t    \sqcap(t)           1  π    log   |    t  +   1  2     t  -   1  2     |          1  π           t    1  2      t    1  2         {1\over\pi}\log\left|{t+{1\over 2}\over t-{1\over 2}}\right|        Dirac delta function     δ   (  t  )       δ  t    \delta(t)\,          1   π  t       1    π  t     {1\over\pi t}        Characteristic Function      χ   [  a  ,  b  ]     (  t  )        subscript  χ   a  b    t    \chi_{[a,b]}(t)\,           1  π   ln   |    t  -  a    t  -  b    |         1  π   ln        t  a     t  b       {\frac{1}{\pi}\text{ln}\left|\frac{t-a}{t-b}\right|}         Notes     An extensive table of Hilbert transforms is available (). Note that the Hilbert transform of a constant is zero.  Domain of definition  It is by no means obvious that the Hilbert transform is well-defined at all, as the improper integral defining it must converge in a suitable sense. However, the Hilbert transform is well-defined for a broad class of functions, namely those in [[Lp space|''L p  ( R )]] for 1p ( R ) for 1H(u)(t) = -\frac{1}{\pi}\lim_{\varepsilon\rightarrow 0}\int_\epsilon^\infty \frac{u(t + \tau) - u(t - \tau)}{\tau}\,d\tau  exists for almost every  t . The limit function is also in L p ( R ) and is in fact the limit in the mean of the improper integral as well. That is,       -    1  π     ∫  ϵ  ∞        u   (   t  +  τ   )    -   u   (   t  -  τ   )     τ    d  τ      →   H   (  u  )    (  t  )       normal-→        1  π     superscript   subscript   ϵ             u    t  τ      u    t  τ     τ   d  τ        H  u  t     -\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{\epsilon}^{\infty}\frac{u(t+\tau)-u(t-\tau)}{\tau}\,d\tau%
 \to H(u)(t)     as ε→0 in the L p -norm, as well as pointwise almost everywhere, by the Titchmarsh theorem .  In the case p =1, the Hilbert transform still converges pointwise almost everywhere, but may fail to be itself integrable even locally . In particular, convergence in the mean does not in general happen in this case. The Hilbert transform of an L 1 function does converge, however, in L 1 -weak, and the Hilbert transform is a bounded operator from L 1 to L 1,w . (In particular, since the Hilbert transform is also a multiplier operator on L 2 , Marcinkiewicz interpolation and a duality argument furnishes an alternative proof that H is bounded on L p .)  Properties  Boundedness  If 1 p ( R ) is a bounded linear operator , meaning that there exists a constant C p such that        ∥   H  u   ∥   p   ≤    C  p     ∥  u  ∥   p         subscript   norm    H  u    p      subscript  C  p    subscript   norm  u   p      \|Hu\|_{p}\leq C_{p}\|u\|_{p}     for all u ∈ L p ( R ). This theorem is due to ; see also . The best constant C p is given by       C  p   =   {      tan    π   2  p          for  1   <  p  ≤  2        cot    π   2  p          for  2   <  p  <  ∞            subscript  C  p    cases      π    2  p           for  1   p       2        π    2  p           for  2   p             C_{p}=\begin{cases}\tan\frac{\pi}{2p}&\text{for }1     This result is due to ; see also . The same best constants hold for the periodic Hilbert transform.  The boundedness of the Hilbert transform implies the L p ( R ) convergence of the symmetric partial sum operator        S  R   f   =    ∫   -  R   R     f  ^    (  ξ  )     e   2  π  i  x  ξ     d  ξ           subscript  S  R   f     superscript   subscript     R    R      normal-^  f   ξ   superscript  e    2  π  i  x  ξ    d  ξ      S_{R}f=\int_{-R}^{R}\hat{f}({\xi})e^{2\pi ix\xi}\,d\xi     to f in L p ( R ), see for example .  Anti-self adjointness  The Hilbert transform is an anti- self adjoint operator relative to the duality pairing between L p ( R ) and the dual space L q ( R ), where p and q are Hölder conjugates and 1 \langle Hu, v \rangle = \langle u, -Hv \rangle  for u ∈ L p ( R ) and v ∈ L q ( R ) .  Inverse transform  The Hilbert transform is an anti-involution , meaning that       H   (   H   (  u  )    )    =   -  u         H    H  u      u     H(H(u))=-u     provided each transform is well-defined. Since H preserves the space L p ( R ), this implies in particular that the Hilbert transform is invertible on L p ( R ), and that       H   -  1    =   -  H        superscript  H    1      H     H^{-1}=-H     Differentiation  Formally, the derivative of the Hilbert transform is the Hilbert transform of the derivative, i.e. these two linear operators commute:       H   (    d  u    d  t    )    =    d   d  t    H   (  u  )          H      d  u     d  t         d    d  t    H  u     H\left(\frac{du}{dt}\right)=\frac{d}{dt}H(u)     Iterating this identity,       H   (     d  k   u    d   t  k     )    =     d  k    d   t  k     H   (  u  )          H       superscript  d  k   u     d   superscript  t  k           superscript  d  k     d   superscript  t  k     H  u     H\left(\frac{d^{k}u}{dt^{k}}\right)=\frac{d^{k}}{dt^{k}}H(u)     This is rigorously true as stated provided u and its first k derivatives belong to L p ( R ) . One can check this easily in the frequency domain, where differentiation becomes multiplication by ω.  Convolutions  The Hilbert transform can formally be realized as a convolution with the tempered distribution        h   (  t  )    =   p.v.   1   π  t           h  t     p.v.    1    π  t       h(t)=\text{p.v. }\frac{1}{\pi t}     Thus formally,       H   (  u  )    =   h  *  u         H  u     h  u     H(u)=h*u     However, a priori this may only be defined for u a distribution of compact support . It is possible to work somewhat rigorously with this since compactly supported functions (which are distributions a fortiori ) are dense in L p . Alternatively, one may use the fact that h ( t ) is the distributional derivative of the function log| t |/π; to wit      H   (  u  )    (  t  )   =   d   d  t     (   1  π    (  u  *  log  |  ⋅  |  )    (  t  )   )      fragments  H   fragments  normal-(  u  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)      d    d  t     fragments  normal-(    1  π    fragments  normal-(  u    normal-|  normal-⋅  normal-|  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-)     H(u)(t)=\frac{d}{dt}\left(\frac{1}{\pi}(u*\log|\cdot|)(t)\right)     For most operational purposes the Hilbert transform can be treated as a convolution. For example, in a formal sense, the Hilbert transform of a convolution is the convolution of the Hilbert transform on either factor:       H   (   u  *  v   )    =    H   (  u  )    *  v   =    u  *  H    (  v  )            H    u  v        H  u   v            u  H   v      H(u*v)=H(u)*v=u*H(v)     This is rigorously true if u and v are compactly supported distributions since, in that case,       h  *   (   u  *  v   )    =    (   h  *  u   )   *  v   =   u  *   (   h  *  v   )            h    u  v        h  u   v          u    h  v       h*(u*v)=(h*u)*v=u*(h*v)     By passing to an appropriate limit, it is thus also true if u ∈ L p and v ∈ L r provided      1  <    1  p   +   1  r        1      1  p     1  r      1<\frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{r}     a theorem due to .  Invariance  The Hilbert transform has the following invariance properties on L 2 ( R ).   It commutes with translations. That is, it commutes with the operators T a ƒ( x ) = ƒ( x + a ) for all a in R  It commutes with positive dilations. That is it commutes with the operators M λ ƒ( x ) = ƒ(λ x ) for all λ > 0.  It anticommutes with the reflection R ƒ( x ) = ƒ(−x).   Up to a multiplicative constant, the Hilbert transform is the only bounded operator on L 2 with these properties .  In fact there is a larger group of operators commuting with the Hilbert transform. The group SL(2, R ) acts by unitary operators U g on the space L 2 ( R ) by the formula         U  g   -  1    f   (  x  )    =     (    c  x   +  d   )    -  1    f   (     a  x   +  b     c  x   +  d    )     ,   g  =   (     a    b      c    d     )       formulae-sequence       superscript   subscript  U  g     1    f  x      superscript      c  x   d     1    f        a  x   b       c  x   d        g    a  b    c  d       \displaystyle{U_{g}^{-1}f(x)=(cx+d)^{-1}f\left({ax+b\over cx+d}\right),\,\,\,g%
 =\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}}     This unitary representation is an example of a principal series representation of SL(2, R ). In this case it is reducible, splitting as the orthogonal sum of two invariant subspaces, Hardy space  H 2 ( R ) and its conjugate. These are the spaces of L 2 boundary values of holomorphic functions on the upper and lower halfplanes. H 2 ( R ) and its conjugate consist of exactly those L 2 functions with Fourier transforms vanishing on the negative and positive parts of the real axis respectively. Since the Hilbert transform is equal to H = - i (2 P - I ), with P being the orthogonal projection from L 2 ( R ) onto H 2 ( R ), it follows that H 2 ( R ) and its orthogonal are eigenspaces of H for the eigenvalues ± i . In other words H commutes with the operators U g . The restrictions of the operators U g to H 2 ( R ) and its conjugate give irreducible representations of SL(2, R )—the so-called limit of discrete series representations . See:        Extending the domain of definition  Hilbert transform of distributions  It is further possible to extend the Hilbert transform to certain spaces of distributions . Since the Hilbert transform commutes with differentiation, and is a bounded operator on L p , H restricts to give a continuous transform on the inverse limit of Sobolev spaces :       𝒟   L  p    =     lim  ⟵    n  →  ∞     W   n  ,  p     (  ℝ  )         subscript  𝒟   superscript  L  p        normal-→  n     normal-⟵      superscript  W   n  p    ℝ     \mathcal{D}_{L^{p}}=\underset{n\to\infty}{\underset{\longleftarrow}{\lim}}W^{n%
 ,p}(\mathbb{R})     The Hilbert transform can then be defined on the dual space of    𝒟   L  p      subscript  𝒟   superscript  L  p     \mathcal{D}_{L^{p}}   , denoted    𝒟   L  p   ′     superscript   subscript  𝒟   superscript  L  p    normal-′    \mathcal{D}_{L^{p}}^{\prime}   , consisting of L p distributions. This is accomplished by the duality pairing: for    u  ∈   𝒟   L  p   ′       u   subscript   superscript  𝒟  normal-′    superscript  L  p      u\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{L^{p}}   , define     H   (  u  )    ∈   𝒟   L  p   ′         H  u    subscript   superscript  𝒟  normal-′    superscript  L  p      H(u)\in\mathcal{D}^{\prime}_{L^{p}}   by       ⟨   H  u   ,  v  ⟩    =  def    ⟨  u  ,   -   H  v    ⟩          H  u   v    def     u      H  v       \langle Hu,v\rangle\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}\langle u,-Hv\rangle     for all    v  ∈   𝒟   L  p        v   subscript  𝒟   superscript  L  p      v\in\mathcal{D}_{L^{p}}   .  It is possible to define the Hilbert transform on the space of tempered distributions as well by an approach due to , but considerably more care is needed because of the singularity in the integral.  Hilbert transform of bounded functions  The Hilbert transform can be defined for functions in L ∞ ( R ) as well, but it requires some modifications and caveats. Properly understood, the Hilbert transform maps L ∞ ( R ) to the Banach space of bounded mean oscillation (BMO) classes.  Interpreted naively, the Hilbert transform of a bounded function is clearly ill-defined. For instance, with u = sgn( x ), the integral defining H ( u ) diverges almost everywhere to ±∞. To alleviate such difficulties, the Hilbert transform of an L ∞ -function is therefore defined by the following regularized form of the integral       H   (  u  )    (  t  )    =   p.v.    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    u   (  τ  )    {    h   (   t  -  τ   )    -    h  0    (   -  τ   )     }   d  τ           H  u  t     p.v.    superscript   subscript            u  τ       h    t  τ       subscript  h  0     τ      d  τ       H(u)(t)=\text{p.v.}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}u(\tau)\left\{h(t-\tau)-h_{0}(-\tau)%
 \right\}\,d\tau     where as above h ( x ) = 1/π x and        h  0    (  x  )    =   {     0       if    |  x  |    <  1         1   π  x       otherwise             subscript  h  0   x    cases  0      if    x    1     1    π  x    otherwise     h_{0}(x)=\begin{cases}0&\mathrm{if\ }|x|<1\\
 \frac{1}{\pi x}&\mathrm{otherwise}\end{cases}     The modified transform H agrees with the original transform on functions of compact support by a general result of ; see . The resulting integral, furthermore, converges pointwise almost everywhere, and with respect to the BMO norm, to a function of bounded mean oscillation.  A deep result of  and  is that a function is of bounded mean oscillation if and only if it has the form ƒ + H ( g ) for some ƒ , g ∈ L ∞ ( R ).  Conjugate functions  The Hilbert transform can be understood in terms of a pair of functions f ( x ) and g ( x ) such that the function       F   (  x  )    =    f   (  x  )    +   i  g   (  x  )           F  x       f  x     i  g  x      F(x)=f(x)+ig(x)   is the boundary value of a holomorphic function  F ( z ) in the upper half-plane . Under these circumstances, if f and g are sufficiently integrable, then one is the Hilbert transform of the other.  Suppose that f ∈ L p ( R ). Then, by the theory of the Poisson integral , f admits a unique harmonic extension into the upper half-plane, and this extension is given by       u   (   x  +   i  y    )    =   u   (  x  ,  y  )    =    1  π     ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  s  )     y     (   x  -  s   )   2   +   y  2      d  s             u    x    i  y       u   x  y             1  π     superscript   subscript            f  s    y     superscript    x  s   2    superscript  y  2     d  s        u(x+iy)=u(x,y)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(s)\frac{y}{(x-s)^{2}+y^{2%
 }}\,ds     which is the convolution of f with the Poisson kernel       P   (  x  ,  y  )    =    1  π    y    x  2   +   y  2            P   x  y        1  π     y     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        P(x,y)=\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{y}{x^{2}+y^{2}}     Furthermore, there is a unique harmonic function v defined in the upper half-plane such that F ( z ) = u ( z ) + i v ( z ) is holomorphic and        lim   y  →  ∞     v   (   x  +   i  y    )     =  0        subscript    normal-→  y       v    x    i  y      0    \lim_{y\to\infty}v(x+iy)=0     This harmonic function is obtained from f by taking a convolution with the conjugate Poisson kernel       Q   (  x  ,  y  )    =    1  π    x    x  2   +   y  2            Q   x  y        1  π     x     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        Q(x,y)=\frac{1}{\pi}\frac{x}{x^{2}+y^{2}}     Thus       v   (  x  ,  y  )    =    1  π     ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  s  )      x  -  s      (   x  -  s   )   2   +   y  2      d  s           v   x  y        1  π     superscript   subscript            f  s      x  s      superscript    x  s   2    superscript  y  2     d  s       v(x,y)=\frac{1}{\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(s)\frac{x-s}{(x-s)^{2}+y^{2}}\,ds     Indeed, the real and imaginary parts of the Cauchy kernel are       i   π  z    =    P   (  x  ,  y  )    +   i  Q   (  x  ,  y  )           i    π  z        P   x  y      i  Q   x  y       \frac{i}{\pi z}=P(x,y)+iQ(x,y)     so that F = u + i v is holomorphic by Cauchy's integral formula .  The function v obtained from u in this way is called the harmonic conjugate of u . The (non-tangential) boundary limit of v ( x , y ) as y → 0 is the Hilbert transform of f . Thus, succinctly,       H   (  f  )    =    lim   y  →  0      Q   (  -  ,  y  )    ⋆  f          H  f     subscript    normal-→  y  0     normal-⋆    Q    y    f      H(f)=\lim_{y\to 0}Q(-,y)\star f     Titchmarsh's theorem  A theorem due to Edward Charles Titchmarsh makes precise the relationship between the boundary values of holomorphic functions in the upper half-plane and the Hilbert transform . It gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a complex-valued square-integrable function F ( x ) on the real line to be the boundary value of a function in the Hardy space  H 2 ( U ) of holomorphic functions in the upper half-plane U .  The theorem states that the following conditions for a complex-valued square-integrable function F : R → C are equivalent:   F ( x ) is the limit as z → x of a holomorphic function F ( z ) in the upper half-plane such that           ∫   -  ∞   ∞       |   F   (   x  +   i  y    )    |   2    d  x    <  K        superscript   subscript             superscript      F    x    i  y      2   d  x    K    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(x+iy)|^{2}\,dx         The real and imaginary parts of the Fourier transform of F(x) are Hilbert transforms of each other.    The Fourier transform     ℱ   (  F  )    (  x  )       ℱ  F  x    \mathcal{F}(F)(x)   vanishes for x < 0.   A weaker result is true for functions of class L p for p > 1 . Specifically, if F ( z ) is a holomorphic function such that        ∫   -  ∞   ∞       |   F   (   x  +   i  y    )    |   p    d  x    <  K        superscript   subscript             superscript      F    x    i  y      p   d  x    K    \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}|F(x+iy)|^{p}\,dx     for all y , then there is a complex-valued function F ( x ) in L p ( R ) such that F ( x + i y ) → F ( x ) in the L p norm as y → 0 (as well as holding pointwise almost everywhere ). Furthermore,       F   (  x  )    =    f   (  x  )    -   i  g   (  x  )           F  x       f  x     i  g  x      F(x)=f(x)-ig(x)     where ƒ is a real-valued function in L p ( R ) and g is the Hilbert transform (of class L p ) of ƒ.  This is not true in the case p = 1. In fact, the Hilbert transform of an L 1 function ƒ need not converge in the mean to another L 1 function. Nevertheless , the Hilbert transform of ƒ does converge almost everywhere to a finite function g such that        ∫   -  ∞   ∞        |   g   (  x  )    |   p    1  +   x  2      d  x    <  ∞        superscript   subscript               superscript      g  x    p     1   superscript  x  2     d  x       \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{|g(x)|^{p}}{1+x^{2}}\,dx<\infty     This result is directly analogous to one by Andrey Kolmogorov for Hardy functions in the disc .  Riemann–Hilbert problem  One form of the Riemann–Hilbert problem seeks to identify pairs of functions F + and F − such that F + is holomorphic on the upper half-plane and F − is holomorphic on the lower half-plane, such that for x along the real axis,         F  +    (  x  )    -    F  -    (  x  )     =   f   (  x  )             subscript  F    x      subscript  F    x      f  x     F_{+}(x)-F_{-}(x)=f(x)     where f ( x ) is some given real-valued function of x ∈ R . The left-hand side of this equation may be understood either as the difference of the limits of F ± from the appropriate half-planes, or as a hyperfunction distribution. Two functions of this form are a solution of the Riemann–Hilbert problem.  Formally, if F ± solve the Riemann–Hilbert problem       f   (  x  )    =     F  +    (  x  )    -    F  -    (  x  )           f  x        subscript  F    x      subscript  F    x      f(x)=F_{+}(x)-F_{-}(x)     then the Hilbert transform of f ( x ) is given by       H   (  f  )    (  x  )    =    1  i    (     F  +    (  x  )    +    F  -    (  x  )     )          H  f  x       1  i        subscript  F    x      subscript  F    x       H(f)(x)=\frac{1}{i}(F_{+}(x)+F_{-}(x))   .  Hilbert transform on the circle  For a periodic function f the circular Hilbert transform is defined as        f  ~    (  x  )    =    1   2  π    p.v.    ∫  0   2  π     f   (  t  )    cot   (    x  -  t   2   )    d  t            normal-~  f   x       1    2  π    p.v.    superscript   subscript   0     2  π      f  t        x  t   2    d  t       \tilde{f}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\text{ p.v.}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(t)\cot\left(\frac{x-t}%
 {2}\right)\,dt     The circular Hilbert transform is used in giving a characterization of Hardy space and in the study of the conjugate function in Fourier series. The kernel,      cot   (     x  -  t   2    )           x  t   2     \scriptstyle\cot\left(\frac{x-t}{2}\right)   is known as the Hilbert kernel since it was in this form the Hilbert transform was originally studied .  The Hilbert kernel (for the circular Hilbert transform) can be obtained by making the Cauchy kernel 1/ x periodic. More precisely, for x ≠0        1  2    cot   (   x  2   )     =    1  x   +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (    1   x  +   2  n  π     +   1   x  -   2  n  π      )             1  2       x  2         1  x     superscript   subscript     n  1          1    x    2  n  π       1    x    2  n  π          \frac{1}{2}\cot\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)=\frac{1}{x}+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(%
 \frac{1}{x+2n\pi}+\frac{1}{x-2n\pi}\right)     Many results about the circular Hilbert transform may be derived from the corresponding results for the Hilbert transform from this correspondence.  Another more direct connection is provided by the Cayley transform C ( x ) = ( x – i ) / ( x + i ), which carries the real line onto the circle and the upper half plane onto the unit disk. It induces a unitary map       U  f   (  x  )    =    π   -   1  2       (   x  +  i   )    -  1    f   (   C   (  x  )    )          U  f  x      superscript  π      1  2      superscript    x  i     1    f    C  x      \displaystyle{Uf(x)=\pi^{-\frac{1}{2}}(x+i)^{-1}f(C(x))}     of L 2 ( T ) onto L 2 ( R ). The operator U carries the Hardy space H 2 ( T ) onto the Hardy space H 2 ( R ). 4  Hilbert transform in signal processing  Bedrosian's theorem  Bedrosian's theorem states that the Hilbert transform of the product of a low-pass and a high-pass signal with non-overlapping spectra is given by the product of the low-pass signal and the Hilbert transform of the high-pass signal, or       H   (    f   L  P     (  t  )    f   H  P     (  t  )    )    =    f   L  P     (  t  )   H   (    f   H  P     (  t  )    )          H     subscript  f    L  P    t   subscript  f    H  P    t       subscript  f    L  P    t  H     subscript  f    H  P    t      H(f_{LP}(t)f_{HP}(t))=f_{LP}(t)H(f_{HP}(t))     where f LP and f HP are the low- and high-pass signals respectively .  Amplitude modulated signals are modeled as the product of a bandlimited "message" waveform, u m ( t ), and a sinusoidal "carrier":       u   (  t  )    =     u  m    (  t  )    ⋅   cos   (    ω  t   +  ϕ   )           u  t    normal-⋅     subscript  u  m   t         ω  t   ϕ       u(t)=u_{m}(t)\cdot\cos(\omega t+\phi)     When u m ( t ) has no frequency content above the carrier frequency,     ω   2  π    Hz,        ω    2  π    Hz,    \frac{\omega}{2\pi}\text{ Hz,}   then by Bedrosian's theorem:       H   (  u  )    (  t  )    =     u  m    (  t  )    ⋅   sin   (    ω  t   +  ϕ   )           H  u  t    normal-⋅     subscript  u  m   t         ω  t   ϕ       H(u)(t)=u_{m}(t)\cdot\sin(\omega t+\phi)     Analytic representation  In the context of signal processing, the conjugate function interpretation of the Hilbert transform, discussed above, gives the analytic representation of a signal u ( t ):        u  a    (  t  )    =    u   (  t  )    +    i  ⋅  H    (  u  )    (  t  )            subscript  u  a   t       u  t      normal-⋅  i  H   u  t      u_{a}(t)=u(t)+i\cdot H(u)(t)     which is a holomorphic function in the upper half plane.  For the narrowband model [above], the analytic representation is:             u  a    (  t  )        subscript  u  a   t    u_{a}(t)           =      u  m    (  t  )    ⋅   cos   (    ω  t   +  ϕ   )     +     i  ⋅   u  m     (  t  )    ⋅   sin   (    ω  t   +  ϕ   )          absent     normal-⋅     subscript  u  m   t         ω  t   ϕ      normal-⋅     normal-⋅  i   subscript  u  m    t         ω  t   ϕ        =u_{m}(t)\cdot\cos(\omega t+\phi)+i\cdot u_{m}(t)\cdot\sin(\omega t+\phi)              =     u  m    (  t  )    ⋅   [    cos   (    ω  t   +  ϕ   )    +   i  ⋅   sin   (    ω  t   +  ϕ   )      ]        absent   normal-⋅     subscript  u  m   t    delimited-[]          ω  t   ϕ     normal-⋅  i        ω  t   ϕ          =u_{m}(t)\cdot\left[\cos(\omega t+\phi)+i\cdot\sin(\omega t+\phi)\right]          This complex heterodyne operation shifts all the frequency components of u m ( t ) above 0 Hz. In that case, the imaginary part of the result is a Hilbert transform of the real part. This is an indirect way to produce Hilbert transforms.  Phase/frequency modulation  The form:       u   (  t  )    =   A  ⋅   cos   (    ω  t   +    ϕ  m    (  t  )     )           u  t    normal-⋅  A        ω  t      subscript  ϕ  m   t        u(t)=A\cdot\cos(\omega t+\phi_{m}(t))     is called phase (or frequency) modulation . The instantaneous frequency is     ω  +    ϕ  m  ′    (  t  )     .      ω     superscript   subscript  ϕ  m   normal-′   t     \omega+\phi_{m}^{\prime}(t).

If u is a function of a non-temporal variable (e.g., spatial) the non-causality might not be a problem. The filter is also of infinite support which may be a problem in certain applications. Another issue relates to what happens with the zero frequency (DC), which can be avoided by assuring that s does not contain a DC-component.  A practical implementation in many cases implies that a finite support filter, which in addition is made causal by means of a suitable delay, is used to approximate the computation. The approximation may also imply that only a specific frequency range is subject to the characteristic phase shift related to the Hilbert transform. See also quadrature filter .

The inverse DTFT, using the convolution theorem , is :       u  ^    [  n  ]        normal-^  u    delimited-[]  n     \displaystyle\hat{u}[n]     where :       h   [  n  ]      =  def     {      0  ,      for  n  even         2   π  n         for  n  odd   ,           superscript   def     h   delimited-[]  n     cases  0    for  n  even     2    π  n      for  n  odd      h[n]\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \begin{cases}0,&\mbox{for }n\mbox{ even}\\
 \frac{2}{\pi n}&\mbox{for }n\mbox{ odd},\end{cases}     which is an infinite impulse response (IIR). When the convolution is performed numerically, an FIR approximation is substituted for h [ n ], as shown in Figure 1 . An FIR filter with an odd number of anti-symmetric coefficients is called Type III , which inherently exhibits responses of zero magnitude at frequencies 0 and Nyquist, resulting in this case in a bandpass filter shape. A Type IV design (even number of anti-symmetric coefficients) is shown in Figure 2 . Since the magnitude response at Nyquist does not drop out, it approximates an ideal Hilbert transformer a little better than the odd-tap filter. However :   A typical (i.e. properly filtered and sampled) u [ n ] sequence has no useful components at the Nyquist frequency.  The Type IV impulse response requires a ½ sample shift in the h[n] sequence. That causes the zero-valued coefficients to become non-zero, as seen in Figure 2. So a Type III design is potentially twice as efficient as Type IV.  The group delay of a Type III design is an integer number of samples, which facilitates aligning     u  ^    [  n  ]        normal-^  u    delimited-[]  n     \hat{u}[n]   with     u   [  n  ]    ,      u   delimited-[]  n     u[n],   to create an analytic signal . The group delay of Type IV is halfway between two samples.   With an FIR approximation to h [ n ], denoted below by      h  ~    [  n  ]    ,       normal-~  h    delimited-[]  n     \tilde{h}[n],   a method called overlap-save is often used to perform the convolution on a long u [ n ] sequence. Segments of length N are convolved with the M filter coefficients, where N > M , resulting in N-M+1 samples of     u  ^   .     normal-^  u    \hat{u}.   The usual implementation actually convolves the u[n] segments with the periodic summation : 5          h  ~   N    [  n  ]      =  def      ∑   m  =   -  ∞    ∞     h  ~    [   n  -   m  N    ]      ,      superscript   def      subscript   normal-~  h   N    delimited-[]  n      superscript   subscript     m             normal-~  h    delimited-[]    n    m  N         \tilde{h}_{N}[n]\ \stackrel{\text{def}}{=}\ \sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}\tilde{h}%
 [n-mN],     which only affects the values of the M-1 outputs that are discarded from each block of N. A tempting shortcut in that implementation is to substitute samples of -i•sgn(ω) (whose real and imaginary components are all just 0 or ±1) for the array FFT      (   h  ~   )   .     normal-~  h    \left(\tilde{h}\right).   That has the effect of convolving with the periodic summation of h [ n ]. Figure 3 compares a half-cycle of h N [ n ] with an equivalent length portion of h [ n ]. Figure 4 is an example of using both the FIR approximation and the DTFT samples. In the example, a sine function is created by computing the Discrete Hilbert transform of a cosine function, which was processed in 4 overlapping segments, and pieced back together. As the FIR result (blue) shows, the distortions apparent in the DTFT result (red) are not caused by the difference between h [ n ] and h N [ n ] (green and red in Fig 3). The fact that h N [ n ] is tapered ( windowed ) is actually helpful in this context. The real problem is that it's not windowed enough. Effectively, M=N, whereas the overlap-save method needs M N [ n'']. The red graph in Figure 5 is the difference between a sine function and the convolution of h 256 [ n ] with 256 samples of a cosine function. The durations of the edge effects are essentially the rise and fall times of the h [ n ] impulse response. The amplitude of the edge effects can be reduced about 50% by increasing N, as shown in the blue graph.  Number Theoretic Hilbert transform  The number theoretic Hilbert transform is an extension () of the discrete Hilbert transform to integers modulo an appropriate prime number. In this it follows the generalization of discrete Fourier transform to number theoretic transforms. The number theoretic Hilbert transform can be used to generate sets of orthogonal discrete sequences().
