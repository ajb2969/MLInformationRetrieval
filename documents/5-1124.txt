   C parity      C parity   In physics , the C parity or charge parity is a multiplicative quantum number of some particles that describes their behavior under the symmetry operation of charge conjugation .  Charge conjugation changes the sign of all quantum charges (that is, additive quantum numbers ), including the electrical charge , baryon number and lepton number , and the flavor charges strangeness , charm , bottomness , topness and Isospin ( I 3 ). In contrast, it doesn't affect the mass , linear momentum or spin of a particle.  Formalism  Consider an operation   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   that transforms a particle into its antiparticle ,         𝒞    |  ψ  ⟩    =   |   ψ  ¯   ⟩    .        𝒞   ket  ψ     ket   normal-¯  ψ      \mathcal{C}\,|\psi\rangle=|\bar{\psi}\rangle.   Both states must be normalizable, so that       1  =   ⟨  ψ  |  ψ  ⟩   =   ⟨   ψ  ¯   |   ψ  ¯   ⟩   =   ⟨  ψ  |    𝒞  †   𝒞   |  ψ  ⟩    ,        1   inner-product  ψ  ψ         inner-product   normal-¯  ψ    normal-¯  ψ          quantum-operator-product  ψ     superscript  𝒞  normal-†   𝒞   ψ      1=\langle\psi|\psi\rangle=\langle\bar{\psi}|\bar{\psi}\rangle=\langle\psi|%
 \mathcal{C}^{\dagger}\mathcal{C}|\psi\rangle,   which implies that   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   is unitary,       𝒞   𝒞  †    =  1.        𝒞   superscript  𝒞  normal-†    1.    \mathcal{C}\mathcal{C}^{\dagger}=\mathbf{1}.   By acting on the particle twice with the   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   operator,         𝒞  2    |  ψ  ⟩    =   𝒞   |   ψ  ¯   ⟩    =   |  ψ  ⟩    ,           superscript  𝒞  2    ket  ψ      𝒞   ket   normal-¯  ψ           ket  ψ      \mathcal{C}^{2}|\psi\rangle=\mathcal{C}|\bar{\psi}\rangle=|\psi\rangle,   we see that     𝒞  2   =  𝟏       superscript  𝒞  2   1    \mathcal{C}^{2}=\mathbf{1}   and    𝒞  =   𝒞   -  1        𝒞   superscript  𝒞    1      \mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}^{-1}   . Putting this all together, we see that       𝒞  =   𝒞  †    ,      𝒞   superscript  𝒞  normal-†     \mathcal{C}=\mathcal{C}^{\dagger},   meaning that the charge conjugation operator is Hermitian and therefore a physically observable quantity.  Eigenvalues  For the eigenstates of charge conjugation,        𝒞    |  ψ  ⟩    =     η  C     |  ψ  ⟩          𝒞   ket  ψ       subscript  η  C    ket  ψ      \mathcal{C}\,|\psi\rangle=\eta_{C}\,|{\psi}\rangle   .  As with parity transformations , applying   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   twice must leave the particle's state unchanged,        𝒞  2    |  ψ  ⟩    =    η  C   𝒞   |  ψ  ⟩    =    η  C  2    |  ψ  ⟩    =   |  ψ  ⟩            superscript  𝒞  2    ket  ψ       subscript  η  C   𝒞   ket  ψ            superscript   subscript  η  C   2    ket  ψ          ket  ψ      \mathcal{C}^{2}|\psi\rangle=\eta_{C}\mathcal{C}|{\psi}\rangle=\eta_{C}^{2}|%
 \psi\rangle=|\psi\rangle   allowing only eigenvalues of     η  C   =   ±  1        subscript  η  C    plus-or-minus  1     \eta_{C}=\pm 1   the so-called C-parity or charge parity of the particle.  Eigenstates  The above implies that    𝒞   |  ψ  ⟩       𝒞   ket  ψ     \mathcal{C}|\psi\rangle   and    |  ψ  ⟩     ket  ψ    |\psi\rangle   have exactly the same quantum charges, so only truly neutral systems – those where all quantum charges and the magnetic moment are zero – are eigenstates of charge parity, that is, the photon and particle-antiparticle bound states like the neutral pion, η or the positronium.  Multiparticle systems  For a system of free particles, the C parity is the product of C parities for each particle.  In a pair of bound bosons there is an additional component due to the orbital angular momentum. For example, in a bound state of two pions , π + π − with an orbital angular momentum  L , exchanging π + and π − inverts the relative position vector, which is identical to a parity operation. Under this operation, the angular part of the spatial wave function contributes a phase factor of (−1) L , where L is the angular momentum quantum number associated with L .        𝒞    |     π  +     π  -    ⟩    =      (   -  1   )   L     |     π  +     π  -    ⟩          𝒞   ket     superscript  π     superscript  π          superscript    1   L    ket     superscript  π     superscript  π         \mathcal{C}\,|\pi^{+}\,\pi^{-}\rangle=(-1)^{L}\,|\pi^{+}\,\pi^{-}\rangle   . With a two- fermion system, two extra factors appear: one comes from the spin part of the wave function, and the second from the exchange of a fermion by its antifermion.        𝒞    |    f    f  ¯    ⟩    =     (   -  1   )   L     (   -  1   )    S  +  1     (   -  1   )    |    f    f  ¯    ⟩    =      (   -  1   )    L  +  S      |    f    f  ¯    ⟩            𝒞   ket    f   normal-¯  f         superscript    1   L    superscript    1     S  1      1    ket    f   normal-¯  f              superscript    1     L  S     ket    f   normal-¯  f         \mathcal{C}\,|f\,\bar{f}\rangle=(-1)^{L}(-1)^{S+1}(-1)\,|f\,\bar{f}\rangle=(-1%
 )^{L+S}\,|f\,\bar{f}\rangle     Bound states can be described with the spectroscopic notation  2 S +1 L J (see term symbol ), where S is the total spin quantum number, L the total orbital momentum quantum number and J the total angular momentum quantum number . Example: the positronium is a bound state electron - positron similar to an hydrogen  atom . The parapositronium and ortopositronium correspond to the states 1 S 0 and 3 S 1 .   With S = 0 spins are anti-parallel, and with S = 1 they are parallel. This gives a multiplicity (2 S +1) of 1 or 3, respectively  The total orbital angular momentum quantum number is L = 0 (S, in spectroscopic notation)  Total angular momentum quantum number is J = 0, 1  C parity η C = (−1) L + S = +1, −1, respectively. Since charge parity is preserved, annihilation of these states in photons ( η C (γ) = −1) must be:          1 S 0   →   γ + γ      3 S 1   →   γ + γ + γ     η C :   +1   =   (−1) × (−1)    −1   =   (−1) × (−1) × (−1)       Experimental tests of C-parity conservation        π  0   →   3  γ      normal-→   superscript  π  0     3  γ     \pi^{0}\rightarrow 3\gamma   : The neutral pion,    π  0     superscript  π  0    \pi^{0}   , is observed to decay to two photons,γ+γ. We can infer that the pion therefore has     η  C   =    (   -  1   )   2   =  1         subscript  η  C    superscript    1   2        1     \eta_{C}=(-1)^{2}=1   , but each additional γ introduces a factor of -1 to the overall C parity of the pion. The decay to 3γ would violate C parity conservation. A search for this decay was conducted 1 using pions created in the reaction      π  -   +  p   →    π  0   +  n      normal-→     superscript  π    p      superscript  π  0   n     \pi^{-}+p\rightarrow\pi^{0}+n   .        η  →    π  +    π  -    π  0       normal-→  η     superscript  π     superscript  π     superscript  π  0      \eta\rightarrow\pi^{+}\pi^{-}\pi^{0}    2 Decay of the Eta meson .        p   p  ¯       p   normal-¯  p     p\bar{p}   annihilations 3   References    "  Category:Quantum mechanics  Category:Quantum field theory     ↩  ↩  ↩
