   Heath-Brown–Moroz constant      Heath-Brown–Moroz constant   The Heath-Brown–Moroz constant C , 1 named for Roger Heath-Brown and Boris Moroz , is defined as      C  =    ∏  p      (   1  -   1  p    )   7    (   1  +     7  p   +  1    p  2     )     =  0.001317641...

C=\prod_{p}\left(1-\frac{1}{p}\right)^{7}\left(1+\frac{7p+1}{p^{2}}\right)=0.0%
 01317641...     where p runs over the primes .  This constant is part of an asymptotic estimate for the distribution of rational points of bounded height on the cubic surface  X 0 3 = X 1 X 2 X 3 . Let H be a positive real number and N ( H ) the number of solutions to the equation X 0 3 = X 1 X 2 X 3 with all the X i non-negative integers less than or equal to H and their greatest common divisor equal to 1. Then        N   (  H  )    =    C  ⋅    H    (   log  H   )   6     4  ×   6  !      +   O   (   H    (   log  H   )   5    )      .
