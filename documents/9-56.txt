Melnikov distance

One of the main tools to determine the existence of (or non-existence of) chaos in a perturbed hamiltonian system is the Melnikov theory. In this theory, the distance between the stable and unstable manifolds of the perturbed system is calculated up to the first order term. Consider a smooth dynamical system 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  periodic with period 
 
 
 
 
 . Suppose for 
 
 
 
  the system has a hyperbolic fixed point x0 and a homoclinic orbit

 
  corresponding to this fixed point. Then for sufficiently small 
 
 
 
  there exists a T-periodic hyperbolic solution. The stable and unstable manifolds of this periodic solution intersect transversally. The distance between these manifolds measured along a direction that is perpendicular to the unperturbed homoclinc orbit 
 
 
 
  is called the Melnikov distance. If 
 
 
 
 
  denotes this distance, then 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
  is called the Melnikov function.
