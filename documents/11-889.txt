   Diamine N-acetyltransferase      Diamine N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a diamine N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + an alkane-alpha,omega-diamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + an N-acetyldiamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and alkane-alpha,omega-diamine , whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyldiamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:alkane-alpha,omega-diamine N-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include spermidine acetyltransferase , putrescine acetyltransferase , putrescine (diamine)-acetylating enzyme , diamine acetyltransferase , spermidine/spermine N1-acetyltransferase , spermidine N1-acetyltransferase , acetyl-coenzyme A-1,4-diaminobutane N-acetyltransferase , putrescine acetylase , and putrescine N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
