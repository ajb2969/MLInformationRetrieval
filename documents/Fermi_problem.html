<h1>Fermi problem</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a> or <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a> <a class="uri" href="education" title="wikilink">education</a>, a <strong>Fermi problem</strong>, <strong>Fermi quiz</strong>, <strong>Fermi question</strong>, <strong>Fermi estimate</strong>, or <strong>Order estimation</strong> is an <a href="Estimation_theory" title="wikilink">estimation</a> problem designed to teach <a href="dimensional_analysis" title="wikilink">dimensional analysis</a>, <a class="uri" href="approximation" title="wikilink">approximation</a>, and the importance of clearly identifying one's assumptions. The solution of such a problem is usually a <a href="back-of-the-envelope_calculation" title="wikilink">back-of-the-envelope calculation</a>. The estimation technique is named after physicist <a href="Enrico_Fermi" title="wikilink">Enrico Fermi</a> as he was known for his ability to make good approximate calculations with little or no actual data. Fermi problems typically involve making justified guesses about quantities and their <a class="uri" href="variance" title="wikilink">variance</a> or lower and upper bounds.</p>
<h2 id="historical-background">Historical background</h2>

<p>An example is <a href="Enrico_Fermi" title="wikilink">Enrico Fermi</a>'s estimate of the strength of the <a href="atomic_bomb" title="wikilink">atomic bomb</a> that detonated at the <a href="Trinity_test" title="wikilink">Trinity test</a>, based on the distance traveled by pieces of paper he dropped from his hand during the blast.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Fermi's estimate of 10 kilotons of <a class="uri" href="TNT" title="wikilink">TNT</a> was remarkably close to the now-accepted value of around 20 kilotons.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>The classic Fermi problem, generally attributed to Fermi,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> is "How many <a href="piano_tuner" title="wikilink">piano tuners</a> are there in <a class="uri" href="Chicago" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>?" A typical solution to this problem involves multiplying a series of estimates that yield the correct answer if the estimates are correct. For example, we might make the following assumptions:</p>
<ol>
<li>There are approximately 9,000,000 people living in Chicago.</li>
<li>On average, there are two persons in each household in Chicago.</li>
<li>Roughly one household in twenty has a piano that is tuned regularly.</li>
<li>Pianos that are tuned regularly are tuned on average about once per year.</li>
<li>It takes a piano tuner about two hours to tune a piano, including travel time.</li>
<li>Each piano tuner works eight hours in a day, five days in a week, and 50 weeks in a year.</li>
</ol>

<p>From these assumptions, we can compute that the number of piano tunings in a single year in Chicago is</p>
<dl>
<dd>(9,000,000 persons in Chicago) / (2 persons/household) × (1 piano/20 households) × (1 piano tuning per piano per year) = 225,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>We can similarly calculate that the average piano tuner performs</p>
<dl>
<dd>(50 weeks/year)×(5 days/week)×(8 hours/day)/(2 hours to tune a piano) = 1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>Dividing gives</p>
<dl>
<dd>(225,000 piano tunings per year in Chicago) / (1000 piano tunings per year per piano tuner) = 225 piano tuners in Chicago.
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The actual number of piano tuners in Chicago is about 290.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>A famous example of a Fermi-problem-like estimate is the <a href="Drake_equation" title="wikilink">Drake equation</a>, which seeks to estimate the number of intelligent civilizations in the galaxy. The basic question of why, if there were a significant number of such civilizations, ours has never encountered any others is called the <a href="Fermi_paradox" title="wikilink">Fermi paradox</a>.</p>
<h2 id="advantages-and-scope">Advantages and scope</h2>

<p>Scientists often look for Fermi estimates of the answer to a problem before turning to more sophisticated methods to calculate a precise answer. This provides a useful check on the results. While the estimate is almost certainly incorrect, it is also a simple calculation that allows for easy error checking, and to find faulty assumptions if the figure produced is far beyond what we might reasonably expect. By contrast, precise calculations can be extremely complex but with the expectation that the answer they produce is correct. The far larger number of factors and operations involved can obscure a very significant error, either in mathematical process or in the assumptions the equation is based on, but the result may still be assumed to be right because it has been derived from a precise formula that is expected to yield good results. Without a reasonable frame of reference to work from it is seldom clear if a result is acceptably precise or is many degrees of magnitude (tens or hundreds of times) too big or too small. The Fermi estimation gives a quick, simple way to obtain this frame of reference for what might reasonably be expected to be the answer, giving context to the results.</p>

<p>As long as the initial assumptions in the estimate are reasonable quantities, the result obtained will give an answer within the same scale as the correct result, and if not gives a base for understanding why this is the case. For example, if the estimate tells you there should be a hundred or so tuners but the precise answer tells you there are many thousands then you know you need to find out why there is this divergence from the expected result. First looking for errors, then for factors the estimation didn't take account of - Does Chicago have a number of music schools or other places with a disproportionately high ratio of pianos to people? Whether close or very far from the observed results, the context the estimation provides gives useful information both about the process of calculation and the assumptions that have been used to look at problems.</p>

<p>Fermi estimates are also useful in approaching problems where the optimal choice of calculation method depends on the expected size of the answer. For instance, a Fermi estimate might indicate whether the internal stresses of a structure are low enough that it can be accurately described by <a href="linear_elasticity" title="wikilink">linear elasticity</a>; or if the estimate already bears significant relationship in <a href="scale_(disambiguation)" title="wikilink">scale</a> relative to some other value, for example, if a structure will be over-engineered to withstand loads several times greater than the estimate.</p>

<p>Although Fermi calculations are often not accurate, as there may be many problems with their assumptions, this sort of analysis does tell us what to look for to get a better answer. For the above example, we might try to find a better estimate of the number of pianos tuned by a piano tuner in a typical day, or look up an accurate number for the population of Chicago. It also gives us a rough estimate that may be good enough for some purposes: if we want to start a store in Chicago that sells piano tuning equipment, and we calculate that we need 10,000 potential customers to stay in business, we can reasonably assume that the above estimate is far enough below 10,000 that we should consider a different business plan (and, with a little more work, we could compute a rough upper bound on the number of piano tuners by considering the most extreme <em>reasonable</em> values that could appear in each of our assumptions).</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>Fermi estimates generally work because the estimations of the individual terms are often close to correct, and overestimates and underestimates help cancel each other out. That is, if there is no consistent bias, a Fermi calculation that involves the multiplication of several estimated factors (such as the number of piano tuners in Chicago) will <em>probably</em> be more accurate than might be first supposed.</p>

<p>In detail, multiplying estimates corresponds to adding their logarithms; thus one obtains a sort of <a href="Wiener_process" title="wikilink">Wiener process</a> or <a href="random_walk" title="wikilink">random walk</a> on the <a href="logarithmic_scale" title="wikilink">logarithmic scale</a>, which diffuses as

 in the number of summands.</p>

<p>For instance, if one makes a 9-step Fermi estimate, at each step overestimating or underestimating the correct number by a factor of 2 (or with a standard deviation 2), then after 9 steps the standard error will have grown by a logarithmic factor of

 (about 2.71 orders of magnitude). If one has a shorter chain or estimates more accurately, the overall estimate will be correspondingly better.</p>
