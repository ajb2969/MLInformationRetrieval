   Airport reference temperature      Airport reference temperature   Airport reference temperature is defined as the monthly mean of average daily temperature ( T a ) for the hottest month of the year plus one-third the difference of this temperature ( T a ) and the monthly mean of the maximum daily temperature ( T m ) for the same month of the year.  Thus airport reference temperature is        T  a   +     T  m   -   T  a    3    .       subscript  T  a        subscript  T  m    subscript  T  a    3     T_{a}+\frac{T_{m}-T_{a}}{3}.
