Averaged over a large number of cores in order to isolate a global signal.     (Figure)  Climate record of Lisiecki and Raymo (2005) constructed by combining measurements from 57 globally distributed deep sea sediment cores. The measured quantity is oxygen isotope fractionation (δ 18 O) in benthic foraminifera. 1      In geochemistry , paleoclimatology and paleoceanography  δ 18 O or delta-O-18 is a measure of the ratio of stable isotopes  18 O: 16 O ( oxygen-18 : oxygen-16 ). It is commonly used as a measure of the temperature of precipitation , as a measure of groundwater/mineral interactions, and as an indicator of processes that show isotopic fractionation , like methanogenesis . In paleosciences, 18 O: 16 O data from corals , foraminifera and ice cores are used as a proxy for temperature. The definition is, in "per mil" (‰, parts per thousand):       δ  18   O  =   (     (    O    18    O    16    )    s  a  m  p  l  e      (    O    18    O    16    )    s  t  a  n  d  a  r  d     -  1  )   *     1000   o      /   o  o        fragments   superscript  δ  18   O    fragments  normal-(     subscript     superscript  O  18    superscript  O  16      s  a  m  p  l  e     subscript     superscript  O  18    superscript  O  16      s  t  a  n  d  a  r  d      1  normal-)     superscript  1000  o    subscript     o  o      \delta^{18}O=\Biggl(\frac{\bigl(\frac{{}^{18}O}{{}^{16}O}\bigr)_{sample}}{%

Mechanism  Foraminifera shells are composed of calcium carbonate (CaCO 3 ) and are found in many common geological environments. The ratio of 18 O to 16 O in the shell is used to indirectly determine the temperature of the surrounding water at the time the shell was formed. The ratio varies slightly depending on the temperature of the surrounding water, as well as other factors such as the water's salinity, and the volume of water locked up in ice sheets.  also reflects local evaporation and freshwater input, as rainwater is 16 O enriched—a result of the preferential evaporation of the lighter 16 O from seawater. Consequently, the surface ocean contains greater amounts of 18 O around the subtropics and tropics where there is more evaporation, and lesser amounts of 18 O in the mid-latitudes where it rains more.  Similarly, when water vapor condenses, heavier water molecules holding 18 O atoms tend to condense and precipitate first. The water vapor gradient heading from the tropics to the poles gradually becomes more and more depleted of 18 O. Snow falling in Canada has much less H 2 18 O than rain in Florida ; similarly, snow falling in the center of ice sheets has a lighter  signature than that at its margins, since heavier 18 O precipitates first.  Changes in climate that alter global patterns of evaporation and precipitation therefore change the background δ 18 O ratio.  Calculations  If the signal can be attributed to temperature change alone, with the effects of salinity and ice volume change ignored, a  increase of 0.22‰ is equivalent to a 1 °C (1.8 °F) cooling. 3 Temperature can also be calculated using the equation:       T   (  deg C  )    =   16.9  -    4.0  ×   δ  18     O  calcite    -    δ  18    O  seawater           T  deg C     16.9      4.0   superscript  δ  18     subscript  normal-O  calcite       superscript  δ  18    subscript  normal-O  seawater       T(\text{deg C})=16.9-4.0\times\mathrm{\delta^{18}O_{calcite}}-\mathrm{\delta^{%
