   Nonlinear distortion      Nonlinear distortion   Nonlinear distortion is a term used (in fields such as electronics , audio and telecommunications) to describe the phenomenon of a non-linear relationship between the "input" and "output" signals of - for example - an electronic device.  Model  For many devices, a linear model is accurate only for small signal levels. For example, at 2 volts input, a typical audio amplifier might put out 20 V, meaning the linear gain is 10 V/V. For 3 V input, it might then output 30 V. However, the model implies that at 50 V input it would produce 500 V, which is not possible with most amplifiers.  Mathematically, the input-output relationship of many devices should be described by a polynomial or Taylor series , as shown below.      v  =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞     a  k    u  k         v    superscript   subscript     k  1         subscript  a  k    superscript  u  k       v=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}a_{k}u^{k}     For larger values of u , the higher order coefficients such as    a  2     subscript  a  2    a_{2}   and    a  3     subscript  a  3    a_{3}   come into play.  Effects of nonlinearity  Nonlinearity can have several effects, which are unwanted in typical situations. The    a  3     subscript  a  3    a_{3}   term for example would, when the input is a sine wave with frequency   ω   ω   \omega   , result in an extra sine wave at    3  ω      3  ω    3\omega   , as shown below.      v  =     (    a  1   +    3  4    a  3     )   s  i  n   (   ω  t   )    -    1  4    a  3   s  i  n   (   3  ω  t   )         v         subscript  a  1       3  4    subscript  a  3     s  i  n    ω  t        1  4    subscript  a  3   s  i  n    3  ω  t       v=(a_{1}+\frac{3}{4}a_{3})sin(\omega t)-\frac{1}{4}a_{3}sin(3\omega t)     In certain situations, this spurious signal can be filtered away because the " harmonic "    3  ω      3  ω    3\omega   lies far outside the frequency range used, but in cable television, for example, third order distortion could cause a 200 MHz signal to interfere with the regular channel at 600 MHz.  Nonlinear distortion applied to a superposition of two signals at different frequencies causes the circuit to act as a frequency mixer , creating intermodulation distortion .
