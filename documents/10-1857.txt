   Quercetin-3,3'-bissulfate 7-sulfotransferase      Quercetin-3,3'-bissulfate 7-sulfotransferase   In enzymology , a quercetin-3,3'-bissulfate 7-sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + quercetin 3,3'-bissulfate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + quercetin 3,7,3'-trissulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and quercetin 3,3'-bissulfate , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and quercetin 3,7,3'-trissulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:quercetin-3,3'-bissulfate 7-sulfotransferase . Other names in common use include flavonol 7-sulfotransferase , 7-sulfotransferase , and PAPS:flavonol 3,3'/3,4'-disulfate 7-sulfotransferase .
