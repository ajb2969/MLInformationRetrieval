   Half-exponential function      Half-exponential function   In mathematics, a half-exponential function is a function ƒ so that if ƒ is composed with itself the result is exponential: 1        f   (   f   (  x  )    )    =   a   b  x     .        f    f  x      a   superscript  b  x      f(f(x))=ab^{x}.\,     Another definition is that ƒ is half-exponential if it is non-decreasing and ƒ −1 ( x C ) ≤ o(log x ). for every C > 0. 2  It has been proven that every function ƒ composed of basic arithmetic operations, exponentials, and logarithms, then ƒ ( ƒ ( x )) is either subexponential or superexponential: 3 half-exponential functions are not expressible in terms of elementary functions .  There are infinitely many functions whose self-composition is the same exponential function as each other. In particular, for every   A   A   A   in the open interval    (  0  ,  1  )     0  1    (0,1)   and for every continuous  strictly increasing function  g from    [  0  ,  A  ]     0  A    [0,A]   onto    [  A  ,  1  ]     A  1    [A,1]   , there is an extension of this function to a continuous monotonic function   f   f   f   on the real numbers such that     f   (   f   (  x  )    )    =   exp  x         f    f  x      x     f(f(x))=\exp x   . 4 In particular,       f   (  x  )    =   {      g   (  x  )         if  x   ∈   [  0  ,  A  ]    ,        exp   (    g   -  1     (  x  )    )         if  x   ∈   (  A  ,  1  ]    ,        exp   (   f   (   ln   (  x  )    )    )         if  x   ∈   (  1  ,  ∞  )    ,        ln   (   f   (   exp   (  x  )    )    )         if  x   ∈   (   -  ∞   ,  0  )    .             f  x    cases    g  x       if  x    0  A         superscript  g    1    x        if  x    A  1        f    x         if  x    1         f    x         if  x        0       f(x)=\begin{cases}g(x)&\mbox{if }x\in[0,A],\\
 \exp(g^{-1}(x))&\mbox{if }x\in(A,1],\\
 \exp(f(\ln(x)))&\mbox{if }x\in(1,\infty),\\
 \ln(f(\exp(x)))&\mbox{if }x\in(-\infty,0).\\
 \end{cases}     Half-exponential functions are used in computational complexity theory for growth rates "intermediate" between polynomial and exponential. 5  See also   Functional square root   References  External links   http://mathoverflow.net/questions/12081/does-the-exponential-function-have-a-square-root  http://mathoverflow.net/questions/45477/closed-form-functions-with-half-exponential-growth   "  Category:Analysis of algorithms  Category:Computational complexity theory     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
