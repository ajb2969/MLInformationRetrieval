Half-exponential function

In mathematics, a half-exponential function is a function ƒ so that if ƒ is composed with itself the result is exponential:1



Another definition is that ƒ is half-exponential if it is non-decreasing and ƒ−1(xC) ≤ o(log x). for every C > 0.2
It has been proven that every function ƒ composed of basic arithmetic operations, exponentials, and logarithms, then ƒ(ƒ(x)) is either subexponential or superexponential:3 half-exponential functions are not expressible in terms of elementary functions.
There are infinitely many functions whose self-composition is the same exponential function as each other. In particular, for every 
 
 
 
  in the open interval 
 
 
 
  and for every continuous strictly increasing function g from 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
 , there is an extension of this function to a continuous monotonic function 
 
 
 
  on the real numbers such that 
 
 
 
 .4 In particular,



Half-exponential functions are used in computational complexity theory for growth rates "intermediate" between polynomial and exponential.5
