   Łoś–Tarski preservation theorem      Łoś–Tarski preservation theorem   The Łoś–Tarski theorem is a theorem in model theory , a branch of mathematics , that states that the set of formulas preserved under taking substructures is exactly the set of universal formulas (Hodges 1997).  Statement  Let   T   T   T   be a theory in a first-order language   L   L   L   and    Φ   (   x  ¯   )       normal-Φ   normal-¯  x     \Phi(\bar{x})   a set of formulas of   L   L   L   . (The set of sequence of variables    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   need not be finite.) Then the following are equivalent:   If   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are models of   T   T   T   ,    A  ⊆  B      A  B    A\subseteq B   ,    a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \bar{a}   is a sequence of elements of   A   A   A   and    B  ⊧   ⋀   Φ   (   a  ¯   )        models  B      normal-Φ   normal-¯  a       B\models\bigwedge\Phi(\bar{a})   , then    A  ⊧   ⋀   Φ   (   a  ¯   )        models  A      normal-Φ   normal-¯  a       A\models\bigwedge\Phi(\bar{a})   . (   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is preserved in substructures for models of   T   T   T   )     Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is equivalent modulo   T   T   T   to a set    Ψ   (   x  ¯   )       normal-Ψ   normal-¯  x     \Psi(\bar{x})   of    ∀  1     subscript  for-all  1    \forall_{1}   formulas of   L   L   L   .   A formula is    ∀  1     subscript  for-all  1    \forall_{1}   if and only if it is of the form    ∀    x  ¯    [   ψ   (   x  ¯   )    ]       for-all     normal-¯  x    delimited-[]    ψ   normal-¯  x        \forall\bar{x}[\psi(\bar{x})]   where    ψ   (   x  ¯   )       ψ   normal-¯  x     \psi(\bar{x})   is quantifier-free.  Note that this property fails for finite models .  References   Peter G. Hinman (2005), Fundamentals of Mathematical Logic , A K Peters, ISBN 1568812620.
