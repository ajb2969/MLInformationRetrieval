Łoś–Tarski preservation theorem

The Łoś–Tarski theorem is a theorem in model theory, a branch of mathematics, that states that the set of formulas preserved under taking substructures is exactly the set of universal formulas (Hodges 1997).
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a theory in a first-order language 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  a set of formulas of 
 
 
 
 . (The set of sequence of variables 
 
 
 
  need not be finite.) Then the following are equivalent:

If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are models of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a sequence of elements of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
 (
 
 
 
  is preserved in substructures for models of 
 
 
 
 )


 
  is equivalent modulo 
 
 
 
  to a set 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  formulas of 
 
 
 
 .

A formula is 
 
 
 
  if and only if it is of the form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is quantifier-free.
Note that this property fails for finite models.
