   Separable partial differential equation      Separable partial differential equation   A separable  partial differential equation (PDE) is one that can be broken into a set of separate equations of lower dimensionality (fewer independent variables) by a method of separation of variables . This generally relies upon the problem having some special form or symmetry . In this way, the PDE can be solved by solving a set of simpler PDEs, or even ordinary differential equations (ODEs) if the problem can be broken down into one-dimensional equations.  The most common form of separation of variables is simple separation of variables in which a solution is obtained by assuming a solution of the form given by a product of functions of each individual coordinate.There is a special form of separation of variables called   R   R   R   -separation of variables which is accomplished by writing the solution as a particular fixed function of the coordinates multiplied by a product of functions of each individual coordinate. Laplace's equation on    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    {\mathbb{R}}^{n}   is an example of a partial differential equation which admits solutions through   R   R   R   -separation of variables; in the three-dimensional case this uses 6-sphere coordinates .  (This should not be confused with the case of a separable ODE, which refers to a somewhat different class of problems that can be broken into a pair of integrals ; see separation of variables .)  Example  For example, consider the time-independent Schrödinger equation        [    -   ∇  2    +   V   (  𝐱  )     ]   ψ   (  𝐱  )    =   E  ψ   (  𝐱  )           delimited-[]       superscript  normal-∇  2      V  𝐱     ψ  𝐱     E  ψ  𝐱     [-\nabla^{2}+V(\mathbf{x})]\psi(\mathbf{x})=E\psi(\mathbf{x})     for the function    ψ   (  𝐱  )       ψ  𝐱    \psi(\mathbf{x})   (in dimensionless units, for simplicity). (Equivalently, consider the inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation .) If the function    V   (  𝐱  )       V  𝐱    V(\mathbf{x})   in three dimensions is of the form        V   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    =     V  1    (   x  1   )    +    V  2    (   x  2   )    +    V  3    (   x  3   )      ,        V    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3          subscript  V  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  V  2    subscript  x  2       subscript  V  3    subscript  x  3       V(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=V_{1}(x_{1})+V_{2}(x_{2})+V_{3}(x_{3}),     then it turns out that the problem can be separated into three one-dimensional ODEs for functions     ψ  1    (   x  1   )        subscript  ψ  1    subscript  x  1     \psi_{1}(x_{1})   ,     ψ  2    (   x  2   )        subscript  ψ  2    subscript  x  2     \psi_{2}(x_{2})   , and     ψ  3    (   x  3   )        subscript  ψ  3    subscript  x  3     \psi_{3}(x_{3})   , and the final solution can be written as     ψ   (  𝐱  )    =        ψ  1    (   x  1   )    ⋅   ψ  2     (   x  2   )    ⋅   ψ  3     (   x  3   )          ψ  𝐱      normal-⋅     normal-⋅     subscript  ψ  1    subscript  x  1     subscript  ψ  2     subscript  x  2     subscript  ψ  3     subscript  x  3      \psi(\mathbf{x})=\psi_{1}(x_{1})\cdot\psi_{2}(x_{2})\cdot\psi_{3}(x_{3})   .
