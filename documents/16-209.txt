23S rRNA pseudouridine746 synthase

23S rRNA pseudouridine746 synthase (, RluA, 23S RNA PSI746 synthase, 23S rRNA pseudouridine synthase, pseudouridine synthase RluA) is an enzyme with system name 23S rRNA-uridine746 uracil mutase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

23S rRNA uridine746

 
  23S rRNA pseudouridine746


RluA is the only protein responsible for the in vivo formation of 23S RNA pseudouridine746.
