   Scale height      Scale height   In various scientific contexts, a scale height is a distance over which a quantity decreases by a factor of e (approximately 2.71828, the base of natural logarithms ). It is usually denoted by the capital letter H .  Scale height used in a simple atmospheric pressure model  For planetary atmospheres, scale height is the increase in altitude for which the atmospheric pressure decreases by a factor of e . The scale height remains constant for a particular temperature. It can be calculated by 1 2      H  =    k  T    M  g        H      k  T     M  g      H=\frac{kT}{Mg}     or equivalently      H  =    R  T   g       H      R  T   g     H=\frac{RT}{g}     where:   k = Boltzmann constant = 1.38 x 10 −23 J·K −1  R = Specific gas constant  T = mean atmospheric temperature in kelvins = 250 K   for Earth   M = mean mass of a molecule (units kg)  g = acceleration due to gravity on planetary surface (m/s²)   The pressure (force per unit area) at a given altitude is a result of the weight of the overlying atmosphere. If at a height of z the atmosphere has density  ρ and pressure P , then moving upwards at an infinitesimally small height dz will decrease the pressure by amount dP , equal to the weight of a layer of atmosphere of thickness dz .  Thus:        d  P    d  z    =   -   g  ρ            d  P     d  z        g  ρ      \frac{dP}{dz}=-g\rho     where g is the acceleration due to gravity. For small dz it is possible to assume g to be constant; the minus sign indicates that as the height increases the pressure decreases. Therefore, using the equation of state for an ideal gas of mean molecular mass M at temperature T, the density can be expressed as      ρ  =    M  P    k  T        ρ      M  P     k  T      \rho=\frac{MP}{kT}     Combining these equations gives        d  P   P   =    -   d  z      k  T    M  g             d  P   P         d  z        k  T     M  g       \frac{dP}{P}=\frac{-dz}{\frac{kT}{Mg}}     which can then be incorporated with the equation for H given above to give:        d  P   P   =   -    d  z   H            d  P   P         d  z   H      \frac{dP}{P}=-\frac{dz}{H}     which will not change unless the temperature does. Integrating the above and assuming where P 0 is the pressure at height z = 0 (pressure at sea level ) the pressure at height z can be written as:      P  =    P  0    exp   (   -   z  H    )         P     subscript  P  0         z  H        P=P_{0}\exp\left(-\frac{z}{H}\right)     This translates as the pressure decreasing exponentially with height. 3  In the Earth's atmosphere , the pressure at sea level P 0 averages about 1.01×10 5 Pa, the mean molecular mass of dry air is 28.964 u and hence 28.964 × 1.660×10 −27 = 4.808×10 −26 kg, and g = 9.81 m/s². As a function of temperature the scale height of the Earth's atmosphere is therefore 1.38/(4.808×9.81)×10 3 = 29.26 m/deg. This yields the following scale heights for representative air temperatures.   T = 290 K, H = 8500 m  T = 273 K, H = 8000 m  T = 260 K, H = 7610 m  T = 210 K, H = 6000 m   These figures should be compared with the temperature and density of the Earth's atmosphere plotted at NRLMSISE-00 , which shows the air density dropping from 1200 g/m 3 at sea level to 0.5 3 = .125 g/m 3 at 70 km, a factor of 9600, indicating an average scale height of 70/ln(9600) = 7.64 km, consistent with the indicated average air temperature over that range of close to 260 K.  Note:   Density is related to pressure by the ideal gas laws. Therefore—with some departures caused by varying temperature—density will also decrease exponentially with height from a sea level value of ρ 0 roughly equal to 1.2 kg m −3  At heights over 100 km, molecular diffusion means that each molecular atomic species has its own scale height.
