   Rayleigh mixture distribution      Rayleigh mixture distribution   In probability theory and statistics a Rayleigh mixture distribution is a weighted mixture of multiple probability distributions where the weightings are equal to the weightings of a Rayleigh distribution . 1 Since the probability density function for a (standard) Rayleigh distribution is given by 2         f   (  x  ;  σ  )    =    x   σ  2     e   -     x  2   /  2    σ  2        ,   x  ≥  0    ,     formulae-sequence      f   x  σ        x   superscript  σ  2     superscript  e         superscript  x  2   2    superscript  σ  2          x  0     f(x;\sigma)=\frac{x}{\sigma^{2}}e^{-x^{2}/2\sigma^{2}},\quad x\geq 0,     Rayleigh mixture distributions have probability density functions of the form        f   (  x  ;  σ  ,  n  )    =    ∫  0  ∞      r   e   -     r  2   /  2    σ  2        σ  2    τ   (  x  ,  r  ;  n  )   d  r     ,        f   x  σ  n      superscript   subscript   0           r   superscript  e         superscript  r  2   2    superscript  σ  2        superscript  σ  2    τ   x  r  n   normal-d  r      f(x;\sigma,n)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{re^{-r^{2}/2\sigma^{2}}}{\sigma^{2}}\tau(%
 x,r;n)\,\mathrm{d}r,     where    τ   (  x  ,  r  ;  n  )       τ   x  r  n     \tau(x,r;n)   is a well-defined probability density function or sampling distribution . 3  The Rayleigh mixture distribution is one of many types of compound distributions in which the appearance of a value in a sample or population might be interpreted as a function of other underlying random variables. Mixture distributions are often used in mixture models , which are used to express probabilities of sub-populations within a larger population.
