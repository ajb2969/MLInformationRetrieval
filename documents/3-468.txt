   Truncated dodecahedron      Truncated dodecahedron   In geometry , the truncated dodecahedron is an Archimedean solid . It has 12 regular decagonal faces, 20 regular triangular faces, 60 vertices and 90 edges. __TOC__  Geometric relations  This polyhedron can be formed from a dodecahedron by truncating (cutting off) the corners so the pentagon faces become decagons and the corners become triangles .  It is used in the cell-transitive hyperbolic space-filling tessellation, the bitruncated icosahedral honeycomb .  Area and volume  The area A and the volume  V of a truncated dodecahedron of edge length a are:      A  =   5   (    3   +   6    5  +   2   5        )    a  2    ≈   100.99076   a  2          A    5      3     6      5    2    5         superscript  a  2           100.99076   superscript  a  2       A=5\left(\sqrt{3}+6\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}}\right)a^{2}\approx 100.99076a^{2}         V  =    5  12    (   99  +   47   5     )    a  3    ≈   85.0396646   a  3          V      5  12     99    47    5      superscript  a  3           85.0396646   superscript  a  3       V=\frac{5}{12}\left(99+47\sqrt{5}\right)a^{3}\approx 85.0396646a^{3}     Cartesian coordinates  The following Cartesian coordinates define the vertices of a truncated  dodecahedron with edge length 2(ϕ−1), centered at the origin: 1   (0, ±1/ϕ, ±(2+ϕ))  (±(2+ϕ), 0, ±1/ϕ)  (±1/ϕ, ±(2+ϕ), 0)  (±1/ϕ, ±ϕ, ±2ϕ)  (±2ϕ, ±1/ϕ, ±ϕ)  (±ϕ, ±2ϕ, ±1/ϕ)  (±ϕ, ±2, ±ϕ 2 )  (±ϕ 2 , ±ϕ, ±2)  (±2, ±ϕ 2 , ±ϕ)   where ϕ = (1 + √5) / 2 is the golden ratio .  Orthogonal projections  The truncated dodecahedron has five special orthogonal projections , centered, on a vertex, on two types of edges, and two types of faces: hexagonal and pentagonal. The last two correspond to the A 2 and H 2  Coxeter planes .      Orthogonal projections     Centered by     Image     Projective symmetry     Dual image     Spherical tilings and Schlegel diagrams  The truncated dodecahedron can also be represented as a spherical tiling , and projected onto the plane via a stereographic projection . This projection is conformal , preserving angles but not areas or lengths. Straight lines on the sphere are projected as circular arcs on the plane.  Schlegel diagrams are similar, with a perspective projection and straight edges.
