(+)-beta-pinene synthase

(+)-beta-pinene synthase (, (+)-pinene cyclase, cyclase III) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((+)-beta-pinene-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate

 
  (+)-beta-pinene + diphosphate


Cyclase III from Salvia officinalis (sage) gives roughly equal parts of (+)-beta-pinene and (+)-alpha-pinene.
