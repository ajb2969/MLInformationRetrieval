   (+)-beta-pinene synthase      (+)-beta-pinene synthase   (+)-beta-pinene synthase (, (+)-pinene cyclase , cyclase III ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((+)-beta-pinene-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+)- beta-pinene + diphosphate    Cyclase III from Salvia officinalis (sage) gives roughly equal parts of (+)-beta-pinene and (+)- alpha-pinene .
