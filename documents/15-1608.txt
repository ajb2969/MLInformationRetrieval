Fbsp wavelet




Fbsp wavelet

In applied mathematics, fbsp wavelets are frequency B-spline wavelets.
fbsp m-fb-fc
These frequency B-spline wavelets are complex wavelets whose spectrum are spline.



where sinc function that appears in Shannon sampling theorem.

m > 1 is the order of the spline
fb is a bandwidth parameter
fc is the wavelet center frequency

Clearly, Shannon wavelet (sinc wavelet) is a particular case of fbsp.
