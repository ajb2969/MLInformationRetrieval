   DNA oxidative demethylase      DNA oxidative demethylase   DNA oxidative demethylase (, alkylated DNA repair protein , alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase ABH1 , alkB (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name methyl DNA-base, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (formaldehyde-forming) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   DNA-base-CH 3 + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   DNA-base + formaldehyde + succinate + CO 2    DNA oxidative demethylase contains iron ; activity is somewhat stimulated by ascorbate .
