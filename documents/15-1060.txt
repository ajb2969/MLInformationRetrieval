DNA oxidative demethylase

DNA oxidative demethylase (, alkylated DNA repair protein, alpha-ketoglutarate-dependent dioxygenase ABH1, alkB (gene)) is an enzyme with system name methyl DNA-base, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (formaldehyde-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

DNA-base-CH3 + 2-oxoglutarate + O2

 
  DNA-base + formaldehyde + succinate + CO2


DNA oxidative demethylase contains iron; activity is somewhat stimulated by ascorbate.
