   Ethylene oxide      Ethylene oxide   Ethylene oxide , properly called oxirane by IUPAC , is the organic compound with the formula . It is a cyclic ether. (A cyclic ether consists of an alkane with an oxygen atom bonded to two carbon atoms of the alkane, forming a ring.) Ethylene oxide is a colorless flammable gas at room temperature, with a faintly sweet odor; it is the simplest epoxide : a three-membered ring consisting of one oxygen atom and two carbon atoms. Because of its special molecular structure, ethylene oxide easily participates in addition reactions ; e.g., opening its ring and thus easily polymerizing . Ethylene oxide is isomeric with acetaldehyde and with vinyl alcohol .  Although it is a vital raw material with diverse applications, including the manufacture of products like polysorbate 20 and polyethylene glycol (PEG) that are often more effective and less toxic than alternative materials, ethylene oxide itself is a very hazardous substance. At room temperature it is a flammable, carcinogenic, mutagenic , irritating, and anaesthetic gas, with a misleadingly pleasant aroma.  The chemical reactivity that is responsible for many of ethylene oxide's hazards has also made it a key industrial chemical. Although too dangerous for direct household use and generally unfamiliar to consumers, ethylene oxide is used industrially for making many consumer products as well as non-consumer chemicals and intermediates. Ethylene oxide is important or critical to the production of detergents, thickeners, solvents, plastics, and various organic chemicals such as ethylene glycol , ethanolamines, simple and complex glycols, polyglycol ethers and other compounds. As a poison gas that leaves no residue on items it contacts, pure ethylene oxide is a disinfectant that is widely used in hospitals and the medical equipment industry to replace steam in the sterilization of heat-sensitive tools and equipment, such as disposable plastic syringes. 1  Ethylene oxide is industrially produced by direct oxidation of ethylene in the presence of silver  catalyst . It is extremely flammable and explosive and is used as a main component of thermobaric weapons ; 2 3 therefore, it is commonly handled and shipped as a refrigerated liquid. 4  History  Ethylene oxide was first reported in 1859 by the French chemist Charles-Adolphe Wurtz , 5 who prepared it by treating 2-chloroethanol with potassium hydroxide :   Cl–CH 2 CH 2 –OH + KOH → (CH 2 CH 2 )O + KCl + H 2 O   Wurtz measured the boiling point of ethylene oxide as 13.5 °C, slightly higher than the present value, and discovered the ability of ethylene oxide to react with acids and salts of metals. 6 Wurtz mistakenly assumed that ethylene oxide has the properties of an organic base. This misconception persisted until 1896 when Georg Bredig found that ethylene oxide is not an electrolyte . 7 8 That it differed from other ethers — particularly by its propensity to engage in addition reactions, which are typical of unsaturated compounds — had long been a matter of debate. The heterocyclic triangular structure of ethylene oxide was proposed by 1868 or earlier. 9  Wurtz's 1859 synthesis long remained the only method of preparing ethylene oxide, despite numerous attempts, including by Wurtz himself, to produce ethylene oxide directly from ethylene . 10 Only in 1931 did French chemist Theodore Lefort develop a method of direct oxidation of ethylene in the presence of silver  catalyst . 11 Since 1940, almost all industrial production of ethylene oxide has relied on this process. 12 Sterilization by ethylene oxide for the preservation of spices was patented in 1938 by the American chemist Lloyd Hall . Ethylene oxide achieved industrial importance during World War I as a precursor to both the coolant ethylene glycol and the chemical weapon  mustard gas .  Molecular structure and properties  (Figure)  Ethylene-oxide.png   The epoxy cycle of ethylene oxide is an almost regular triangle with bond angles of about 60° and a significant angular strain corresponding to the energy of 105 kJ/mol. 13 14 For comparison, in alcohols the C–O–H angle is about 110°; in ethers , the C–O–C angle is 120°. The moment of inertia about the principal axes are I A = 32.921×10 −40 g·cm², I B = 37.926×10 −40 g·cm² and I C = 59.510×10 −40 g·cm². 15 The dipole moment at a temperature in the range 17–176 °C is 6.26×10 −30 C·m. 16  The relative instability of the carbon-oxygen bonds in the molecule is revealed by the comparison in the table of the energy required to break two C–O bonds in the ethylene oxide or one C–O bond in ethanol and dimethyl ether : 17      Reaction   ΔH° 298 , kJ/mol   Method     (C 2 H 4 )O → C 2 H 4 + O (cleavage of two bonds)   354.38   Calculated, from atomic enthalpies     C 2 H 5 OH → C 2 H 5 + OH (breaking one bond)   405.85   Electron impact     CH 3 OCH 3 → CH 3 O + CH 3 (breaking one bond)   334.72   Calculated using enthalpies of radicals formation     This instability determines the chemical activity of ethylene oxide and explains the ease of opening its cycle in addition reactions (see Chemical properties ).  Physical properties  Ethylene oxide is a colorless gas at 25 °C and is a mobile liquid at 0 °C – viscosity of liquid ethylene oxide at 0 °C is about 5.5 times lower than that of water. The gas has a characteristic sweet odor of ether, noticeable when its concentration in air exceeds 500 ppm. 18 Ethylene oxide is readily soluble in water, ethanol , diethyl ether and many organic solvents. 19  Main thermodynamical constants are: 20   Standard molar heat capacity , C p ° = 48.19 J/(mol·K);  Standard enthalpy of formation, ΔH° 298 = −51.037 kJ/mol;  Standard entropy , S° 298 = 243.4 J/(mol·K);  Gibbs free energy , ΔG° 298 = −11.68 kJ/mol;  Heat of combustion , ΔH c ° = −1306 kJ/mol. 21   The surface tension of liquid ethylene oxide, at the interface with its own steam, is 35.8 mJ/m 2 at −50.1 °C and 27.6 mJ/m 2 at −0.1 °C. 22  The boiling point increases with the vapor pressure as follows: 23 57.7 (2 atm), 83.6 (5 atm) and 114.0 (10 atm).  Viscosity decreases with temperature with the values of 0.577 kPa·s at −49.8 °C, 0.488 kPa·s at −38.2 °C, 0.394 kPa·s at −21.0 °C and 0.320 kPa·s at 0 °C. 24  Between −91 °C and 10.5 °C, vapor pressure p (in mmHg) varies with temperature (T in °C) as lg p = 6.251 – 1115.1/(244.14 + T). 25      Properties of liquid ethylene oxide 26   Temperature, °C   Steam pressure, kPa   Enthalpy of the liquid, J/g   Enthalpy of vaporization, J/g   Density, kg/L   Heat capacity , J/(kg·K)   Thermal conductivity , W/(m·K)     −40 °C   8.35   0   628.6   0.9488   1878   0.20     −20 °C   25.73   38.8   605.4   0.9232   1912   0.18     0 °C   65.82   77.3   581.7   0.8969   1954   0.16     20 °C   145.8   115.3   557.3   0.8697   2008   0.15     40 °C   288.4   153.2   532.1   0.8413   2092   0.14     60 °C   521.2   191.8   505.7   0.8108   2247   0.14     80 °C   875.4   232.6   477.4   0.7794   2426   0.14     100 °C   1385.4   277.8   445.5   0.7443   2782   0.13     120 °C   2088   330.4   407.5   0.7052   3293   N/A*     140 °C   3020   393.5   359.4   0.6609   4225   N/A     160 °C   4224   469.2   297.1   0.608   N/A   N/A     180 °C   5741   551.2   222.5   0.533   N/A   N/A     195.8 °C   7191   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A   N/A     *N/A – data not available.

Chemical properties  Ethylene oxide readily reacts with diverse compounds with opening of the ring. Its typical reactions are with nucleophiles which proceed via the S N 2 mechanism both in acidic (weak nucleophiles: water, alcohols) and alkaline media (strong nucleophiles: OH − , RO − , NH 3 , RNH 2 , RR'NH, etc.). 28 The general reaction scheme is      and more specific reactions are described below.  Addition of water and alcohols  Aqueous solutions of ethylene oxide are rather stable and can exist for a long time without any noticeable chemical reaction, but adding a small amount of acid, such as strongly diluted sulfuric acid , immediately leads to the formation of ethylene glycol , even at room temperature:   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + H 2 O → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –OH   The reaction also occurs in the gas phase, in the presence of a phosphoric acid salt as a catalyst. 29  The reaction is usually carried out at about 60 °C with a large excess of water, in order to prevent the reaction of the formed ethylene glycol with ethylene oxide that would form di- and triethylene glycol : 30   2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + H 2 O → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –O–CH 2 CH 2 –OH    3 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + H 2 O → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –O–CH 2 CH 2 –O–CH 2 CH 2 –OH   The use of alkaline catalysts may lead to the formation of polyethylene glycol :   n (CH 2 CH 2 )O + H 2 O → HO–(–CH 2 CH 2 –O–) n –H   Reactions with alcohols proceed similarly yielding ethylene glycol ethers:   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + C 2 H 5 OH → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –OC 2 H 5     2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + C 2 H 5 OH → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –O–CH 2 CH 2 –OC 2 H 5    Reactions with lower alcohols occur less actively than with water and require more severe conditions, such as heating to 160 °C and pressurizing to 3 MPa and adding an acid or alkali catalyst.  Reactions of ethylene oxide with fatty alcohols proceed in the presence of sodium metal, sodium hydroxide or boron trifluoride and are used for the synthesis of surfactants . 31  Addition of carboxylic acids and their derivatives  Reactions of ethylene oxide with carboxylic acids in the presence of a catalyst results in incomplete and with anhydrides in complete glycol esters:   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + CH 3 COOH → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –OCOCH 3     (CH 2 CH 2 )O + (CH 3 CO) 2 O → CH 3 COO–CH 2 CH 2 –OCOCH 3    The addition of acid amides proceeds similarly:   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + CH 3 CONH 2 → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –NHCOCH 3    Addition of ethylene oxide to higher carboxylic acids is carried out at elevated temperatures (typically 140–180 °C) and pressure (0.3–0.5 MPa) in an inert atmosphere, in presence of an alkaline catalyst (concentration 0.01–2%), such as hydroxide or carbonate of sodium or potassium. 32 The carboxylate ion acts as nucleophile in the reaction:   RCOOH + OH − → RCOO − + H 2 O    (CH 2 CH 2 )O + RCOO − → RCOOCH 2 CH 2 O −     RCOOCH 2 CH 2 O − + RCOOH → RCOOCH 2 CH 2 OH + RCOO −    Adding ammonia and amines  Ethylene oxide reacts with ammonia forming a mixture of mono-, di- and tri- ethanolamines . The reaction is stimulated by adding a small amount of water.   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + NH 3 → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –NH 2     2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + NH 3 → (HO–CH 2 CH 2 ) 2 NH    3 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + NH 3 → (HO–CH 2 CH 2 ) 3 N   Similarly proceed the reactions with primary and secondary amines:   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + RNH 2 → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –NHR   Dialkylamino ethanols can further react with ethylene oxide, forming amino polyethylene glycols: 33   n (CH 2 CH 2 )O + R 2 NCH 2 CH 2 OH → R 2 NCH 2 CH 2 O–(–CH 2 CH 2 O–) n –H   Trimethylamine reacts with ethylene oxide in the presence of water, forming choline : 34   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + (CH 3 ) 3 N + H 2 O → [HOCH 2 CH 2 N (CH 3 ) 3 ] + OH −    Aromatic primary and secondary amines also react with ethylene oxide, forming the corresponding arylamino alcohols.  Halide addition  Ethylene oxide readily reacts with aqueous solutions of hydrochloric , hydrobromic and hydroiodic acids to form halohydrins . The reaction occurs easier with the last two acids:   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + HCl → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –Cl   The reaction with these acids competes with the acid-catalyzed hydration of ethylene oxide; therefore, there is always a by-product of ethylene glycol with an admixture of diethylene glycol. For a cleaner product, the reaction is conducted in the gas phase or in an organic solvent.  Ethylene fluorohydrin is obtained differently, by boiling hydrogen fluoride with a 5–6% solution of ethylene oxide in diethyl ether . The ether normally has a water content of 1.5–2%; in absence of water, ethylene oxide polymerizes. 35  Halohydrins can also be obtained by passing ethylene oxide through aqueous solutions of metal halides: 36   2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + CuCl 2 + 2 H 2 O → 2 HO–CH 2 CH 2 –Cl + Cu(OH) 2 ↓   Metalorganic addition  Interaction of ethylene oxide with organomagnesium compounds, which are Grignard reagents , can be regarded as nucleophilic substitution influenced by carbanion organometallic compounds. The final product of the reaction is a primary alcohol:         (    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    )   𝖮   +  𝖱𝖬𝗀𝖡𝗋   →    𝖱   -    𝖢𝖧  𝟤     𝖢𝖧  𝟤     -   𝖮𝖬𝗀𝖡𝗋      →    𝖧  𝟤   𝖮       𝖱   -    𝖢𝖧  𝟤     𝖢𝖧  𝟤     -  𝖮𝖧        normal-→         subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮   𝖱𝖬𝗀𝖡𝗋     𝖱     subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮𝖬𝗀𝖡𝗋         subscript  𝖧  2   𝖮   normal-→       𝖱     subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮𝖧      \mathsf{(CH_{2}CH_{2})O+RMgBr}\rightarrow\mathsf{R\!\!-\!\!CH_{2}CH_{2}\!\!-\!%

One method is the cationic cyclopolymerization of ethylene oxide, limiting the size of the formed cycle: 42   n (CH 2 CH 2 )O → (–CH 2 CH 2 –O–) n    To suppress the formation of other linear polymers the reaction is carried out in a highly dilute solution. 43  Reaction of ethylene oxide with sulfur dioxide in the presence of caesium salts leads to the formation of an 11-membered heterocyclic compound which has the complexing properties of crown ethers: 44      Isomerization  When ethylene oxide is heated to about 400 °C, or to 150–300 °C in the presence of a catalyst ( Al 2 O 3 , H 3 PO 4 , etc.), it isomerizes into acetaldehyde : 45        (    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    )    𝖮      →      𝟤𝟢𝟢   𝗈   𝖢   ,    𝖠𝗅  𝟤    𝖮  𝟥         𝖢𝖧  𝟥   𝖢𝖧𝖮           superscript  200  𝗈   𝖢      subscript  𝖠𝗅  2    subscript  𝖮  3     normal-→        subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮      subscript  𝖢𝖧  3   𝖢𝖧𝖮     \mathsf{(CH_{2}CH_{2})O\ \xrightarrow{200\ ^{o}C,\ Al_{2}O_{3}}\ CH_{3}CHO}     The radical mechanism was proposed by Sidney W. Benson to explain this reaction in the gas phase; it comprises the following stages: 46  1) (CH 2 CH 2 )O ↔ •CH 2 CH 2 O• → CH 3 CHO*  2) CH 3 CHO* → CH 3 • + CHO•  3) CH 3 CHO* + M → CH 3 CHO + M*  In reaction 3), M refers to the wall of the reaction vessel or to a heterogeneous catalyst. The moiety CH 3 CHO* represents a short-lived (lifetime of 10 −8.5 seconds), activated molecule of acetaldehyde. Its excess energy is about 355.6 kJ/mol, which exceeds by 29.3 kJ/mol the binding energy of the C-C bond in acetaldehyde. 47  In absence of a catalyst, the thermal isomerization of ethylene oxide is never selective and apart from acetaldehyde yields significant amount of by-products (see section Thermal decomposition ). 48  Reduction reaction  Ethylene oxide can be hydrogenated into ethanol in the presence of a catalyst, such as nickel , platinum , palladium , 49  boranes , lithium aluminium hydride and some other hydrides . 50         (    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    )   𝖮   +    𝖧  𝟤       →      𝟪𝟢   𝗈   𝖢   ,  𝖭𝗂       𝖢  𝟤    𝖧  𝟧   𝖮𝖧           superscript  80  𝗈   𝖢   𝖭𝗂   normal-→          subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮    subscript  𝖧  2       subscript  𝖢  2    subscript  𝖧  5   𝖮𝖧     \mathsf{(CH_{2}CH_{2})O+H_{2}\ \xrightarrow{80\ ^{o}C,\ Ni}\ C_{2}H_{5}OH}     Conversely, with some other catalysts, ethylene oxide may be reduced by hydrogen to ethylene with the yield up to 70%.

The selectivity and speed of dimerization can be increased by adding a catalyst, such as platinum, platinum-palladium or iodine with sulfolan ; however, 2-methyl-1,3- dioxolane is formed as a side product in the last case. 54  Polymerization  Liquid ethylene oxide can form polyethyleneglycols . The polymerization can proceed via radical and ionic mechanisms, but only the latter has a wide practical application. 55  Cationic polymerization of ethylene oxide is assisted by protonic acids ( HClO 4 , HCl ), Lewis acids ( SnCl 4 , BF 3 , etc.), organometallic compounds or more complex reagents: 56       𝗇   (    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    )    𝖮      →   𝖲𝗇𝖢𝗅  𝟦       (    -    𝖢𝖧  𝟤     𝖢𝖧  𝟤      -    𝖮   -    )   𝗇        subscript  𝖲𝗇𝖢𝗅  4   normal-→     𝗇     subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮    subscript         subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2      limit-from  𝖮     𝗇     \mathsf{n(CH_{2}CH_{2})O\ \xrightarrow{SnCl_{4}}\ (-\!CH_{2}CH_{2}\!\!-\!\!O\!%
 -)_{n}}     The reaction mechanism is as follows. 57 At the first stage, the catalyst (MX m ) is initiated by alkyl-or acylhalogen or by compounds with active hydrogen atoms, usually water, alcohol or glycol:   MX m + ROH → MX m RO − H +    The resulting active complex reacts with ethylene oxide via the S N 2 mechanism:   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + MX m RO − H + → (CH 2 CH 2 )O•••H + O − RMX m     (CH 2 CH 2 )O•••H + O − RMX m → HO–CH 2 CH 2 + + MX m RO − 2     HO–CH 2 CH 2 + + n (CH 2 CH 2 )O → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –(O–CH 2 CH 2 ) n +    The chain breaks as   HO–CH 2 CH 2 –(O–CH 2 CH 2 ) n + + MX m RO − → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –(O–CH 2 CH 2 ) n –OR + MX m     H(O–CH 2 CH 2 ) n –O–CH 2 –CH 2 + + MX m RO − → H(O–CH 2 CH 2 ) n –O–CH=CH 2 + MX m + ROH   Anionic polymerization of ethylene oxide is assisted by bases, such as alkoxides , hydroxides , carbonates or other compounds of alkali or alkaline earth metals . 58 The reaction mechanism is as follows: 59   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + RONa → RO–CH 2 CH 2 –O − Na +     RO–CH 2 CH 2 –O − Na + + n (CH 2 CH 2 )O → RO–(CH 2 CH 2 –O) n –CH 2 CH 2 –O − Na +     RO–(CH 2 CH 2 –O) n –CH 2 CH 2 –O − Na + → RO–(CH 2 CH 2 –O) n –CH=CH 2 + NaOH    RO–(CH 2 CH 2 –O) n –CH 2 CH 2 –O − Na + + H 2 O → RO–(CH 2 CH 2 –O) (n+1) OH + NaOH   Thermal decomposition  Ethylene oxide is relatively stable to heating – in the absence of a catalyst, it does not dissociate up to 300 °C, and only above 570 °C there is a major exothermic decomposition, which proceeds through the radical mechanism. 60 The first stage involves isomerization , however high temperature accelerates the radical processes. They result in a gas mixture containing acetaldehyde, ethane, ethyl, methane, hydrogen, carbon dioxide, ketene and formaldehyde . 61 High-temperature pyrolysis (830–1200 K) at elevated pressure in an inert atmosphere leads to a more complex composition of the gas mixture, which also contains acetylene and propane . 62 Contrary to the isomerization, initiation of the chain occurs mainly as follows: 63   (CH 2 CH 2 )O → •CH 2 CH 2 O• → CH 2 O + CH 2 :   When carrying the thermal decomposition of ethylene oxide in the presence of transition metal compounds as catalysts, it is possible not only to reduce its temperature, but also to have ethyl as the main product, that is to reverse the ethylene oxide synthesis reaction.  Other reactions  Thiocyanate ions or thiourea transform ethylene oxide into thiiranes (ethylene sulfides): 64   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + (NH 2 ) 2 C=S → (CH 2 CH 2 )S + (NH 2 ) 2 C=O       Reaction of phosphorus pentachloride with ethylene oxide produces ethylene dichloride : 65   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + PCl 5 → Cl–CH 2 CH 2 –Cl + POCl 3    Other dichloro derivatives of ethylene oxide can be obtained by combined action of sulfuryl chloride (SOCl 2 ) and pyridine and of triphenylphosphine and carbon tetrachloride . 66  Phosphorus trichloride reacts with ethylene oxide forming chloroethyl esters of phosphorous acid: 67   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + PCl 3 → Cl–CH 2 CH 2 –OPCl 2     2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + PCl 3 → (Cl–CH 2 CH 2 –O) 2 PCl    3 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + PCl 3 → Cl–CH 2 CH 2 –O) 3 P   The reaction product of ethylene oxide with acyl chlorides in the presence of sodium iodide is a complex iodoethyl ether: 68   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + RCOCl + NaI → RC(O)–OCH 2 CH 2 –I + NaCl   Heating ethylene oxide to 100 °C with carbon dioxide , in a non-polar solvent in the presence of bis -(triphenylphosphine)-nickel(0) results in ethylene carbonate : 69      In industry, a similar reaction is carried out at high pressure and temperature in the presence of quaternary ammonium or phosphonium salts as a catalyst. 70  Reaction of ethylene oxide with formaldehyde at 80–150 °C in the presence of a catalyst leads to the formation of 1,3-dioxolane : 71      Substituting formaldehyde by other aldehydes or ketones results in a 2-substituted 1,3-dioxolane (yield: 70–85%, catalyst: tetraethylammonium bromide). 72  Catalytic hydroformylation of ethylene oxide gives hydroxypropanal which can be hydrogenated to propane-1,3-diol : 73         (    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    )   𝖮   +  𝖢𝖮  +   𝖧  𝟤    →    𝖢𝖧𝖮   -    𝖢𝖧  𝟤     𝖢𝖧  𝟤     -   𝖮𝖧      →   +   𝖧  𝟤        𝖧𝖮   -    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤     𝖢𝖧  𝟤     -  𝖮𝖧        normal-→         subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮   𝖢𝖮   subscript  𝖧  2      𝖢𝖧𝖮     subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮𝖧         subscript  𝖧  2    normal-→       𝖧𝖮     subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮𝖧      \mathsf{(CH_{2}CH_{2})O+CO+H_{2}}\rightarrow\mathsf{CHO\!\!-\!\!CH_{2}CH_{2}\!%

The above reaction is slow and has low yield, therefore it is not used in the industry. 77  Other preparative methods  Other synthesis methods include 78 reaction of diiodo ethane with silver oxide :   I–CH 2 CH 2 –I + Ag 2 O → (CH 2 CH 2 )O + 2 AgI   and decomposition of ethylene carbonate at 200–210 °C in the presence of hexachloroethane :      Industrial synthesis  History  Commercial production of ethylene oxide dates back to 1914 when BASF built the first factory which used the chlorohydrin process (reaction of ethylene chlorohydrin with calcium hydroxide). The chlorohydrin process was unattractive for several reasons, including low efficiency and loss of valuable chlorine into calcium chloride . 79 More efficient direct oxidation of ethylene by air was invented by Lefort in 1931 and in 1937 Union Carbide opened the first plant using this process. It was further improved in 1958 by Shell Oil Co. by replacing air with oxygen and using elevated temperature of 200–300 °C and pressure (1–3 MPa). 80 This more efficient routine accounted for about half of ethylene oxide production in the 1950s in the U.S., and after 1975 it completely replaced the previous methods. 81 The production of ethylene oxide accounts for approximately 11% of worldwide ethylene demand. 82  Chlorohydrin process of production of ethylene oxide  Although the chlorohydrin process is almost entirely superseded in the industry by the direct oxidation of ethylene, the knowledge of this method is still important for educational reasons and because it is still used in the production of propylene oxide . 83 The process consists of three major steps: synthesis of ethylene chlorohydrin, dehydrochlorination of ethylene chlorohydrin to ethylene oxide and purification of ethylene oxide. Those steps are carried continuously. In the first column, hypochlorination of ethylene is carried out as follows: 84   Cl 2 + H 2 O → HOCl + HCl    CH 2 =CH 2 + HOCl → OH–CH 2 CH 2 –Cl    CH 2 =CH 2 + Cl 2 → Cl–CH 2 CH 2 –Cl   To suppress the conversion of ethylene into the ethylene dichloride (the last reaction), the concentration of ethylene is maintained at about 4–6%, and the solution is heated by steam to the boiling point. 85  Next, aqueous solution of ethylene chlorohydrin enters the second column, where it reacts with a 30% solution of calcium hydroxide at 100 °C: 86   2 OH–CH 2 CH 2 –Cl + Ca(OH) 2 → 2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + CaCl 2 + 2H 2 O   The produced ethylene oxide is purified by rectification . The chlorohydrin process allows to reach 95% conversion of ethylene chlorohydrin. The yield of ethylene oxide is about 80% of the theoretical value; for 1 ton of ethylene oxide, about 200 kg of ethylene dichloride is produced. 87 But, the major drawbacks of this process are high chlorine consumption and effluent load. This process is now obsolete.  Direct oxidation of ethylene  Usage in global industry  Direct oxidation of ethylene was patented by Lefort in 1931. This method was repeatedly modified for industrial use, and at least four major variations are known. They all use oxidation by oxygen or air and a silver-based catalyst, but differ in the technological details and hardware implementations. 88  Union Carbide (currently a division of Dow Chemical Company ) was the first company to develop the direct oxidation process. 89  A similar production method was developed by Scientific Design Co., but it received wider use because of the licensing system – it accounts for 25% of the world's production and for 75% of world's licensed production of ethylene oxide. 90 91 A proprietary variation of this method is used by Japan Catalytic Chemical Co., which adapted synthesis of both ethylene oxide and ethylene glycol in a single industrial complex.  A different modification was developed Shell International Chemicals BV. Their method is rather flexible with regard to the specific requirements of specific industries; it is characterized by high selectivity with respect to the ethylene oxide product and long lifetime of the catalyst (3 years). It accounts for about 40% of global production. 92  Older factories typically use air for oxidation whereas newer plants and processes, such as METEOR and Japan Catalytic, favor oxygen. 93  Chemistry and kinetics of the direct oxidation process  Formally, the direct oxidation process is expressed by the following equation:       𝟤  𝖢    𝖧  𝟤     =    𝖢𝖧  𝟤   +    𝖮  𝟤      →  𝖠𝗀    2   (    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    )   𝖮           2  𝖢   subscript  𝖧  2       subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖮  2       𝖠𝗀  normal-→       2     subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮      \mathsf{2CH_{2}\!\!=\!\!CH_{2}+O_{2}\ \xrightarrow{Ag}\ 2(CH_{2}CH_{2})O}   ΔH = -105 kJ/mol  However, significant yield of carbon dioxide and water is observed in practice, which can be explained by the complete oxidation of ethylene or ethylene oxide:   CH 2 =CH 2 + 3 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 O ΔH = -1327 kJ/mol    (CH 2 CH 2 )O + 2.5 O 2 → 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 O ΔH = -1223 kJ/mol   The process of heterogeneous catalytic oxidation of ethylene was studied by P. A. Kilty and W. M. H. Sachtler, who suggested the following mechanism: 94   O 2 + 4 Ag(adj) → 4 Ag + 2 O 2− (ads)  O 2 + Ag → Ag + + O 2 −   O 2 − (ads) + CH 2 =CH 2 → (CH 2 CH 2 )O + O(ads)  6 O (ads) + CH 2 =CH 2 → 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 O   Here (ads) refers to particles adsorbed on the catalyst surface and (adj) to particles of silver, directly adjacent to the oxygen atoms. In this process, 1,2-dichloroethane, vinyl chloride are used as inhibitors so as to prevent further oxidation of ethylene oxide to CO 2 and H 2 O. Here, the chemisorbed chlorine hinders dissociative chemisorption of atomic oxygen.  Thus the overall reaction is expressed as   7 CH 2 =CH 2 + 6 O 2 → 6 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + 2 CO 2 + 2 H 2 O   and the maximum degree of conversion of ethylene to ethylene oxide is 6/7 or 85.7%. 95  The catalyst for the reaction is metallic silver deposited on various matrixes, including pumice , silica gel , various silicates and aluminosilicates , alumina and silicon carbide , and activated by certain additives ( antimony , bismuth , barium peroxide , etc.). 96 The process temperature was optimized as 220–280 °C. Lower temperatures reduce the activity of the catalyst, and higher temperatures promote the complete oxidation of ethylene thereby reducing the yield of ethylene oxide. Elevated pressure of 1–3 MPa increases the productivity of the catalyst and facilitates absorption of ethylene oxide from the reacting gases. 97  Whereas oxidation by air is still being used, oxygen (> 95% purity) is preferred for several reasons, such as higher molar yield of ethylene oxide (75–82% for oxygen vs. 63–75% for air), higher reaction rate (no gas dilution) and no need of separating nitrogen in the reaction products. 98 99  Process overview  The production of ethylene oxide on a commercial scale is attained with the unification of the following unit processes :   Main reactor  Ethylene oxide scrubber  Ethylene oxide de-sorber  Stripping and distillation column  CO 2 scrubber and CO 2 de-scrubber   Main Reactor: The main reactor consists of thousands of catalyst tubes in bundles. These tubes are generally 6 to 15 m long with an inner diameter of 20 to 50 mm. The catalyst packed in these tubes is in the form of spheres or rings of diameter 3 to 10 mm. The operating conditions of 200 o C to 300 o C with a pressure of 1 to 3 MPa prevail in the reactor. To maintain this temperature, the cooling system of the reactor plays a vital role. With the aging of the catalyst, its selectivity decreases and it produces more exothermic side products of CO 2 .  Ethylene oxide scrubber: After the gaseous stream from the main reactor, containing ethylene oxide (1–2%) and CO 2 (5%), is cooled, it is then passed to the ethylene oxide scrubber. Here, water is used as the scrubbing media which scrubs away majority of ethylene oxide along with some amounts of CO 2 , N 2 , CH 2 CH 2 , CH 4 and aldehydes (introduced by the recycle stream). Also, a small proportion of the gas leaving the ethylene oxide scrubber (0.1 – 0.2%) is removed continuously (combusted) to prevent the buildup of inert compounds (N 2 , Ar, and C 2 H 6 ), which are introduced as impurities with the reactants.  Ethylene oxide de-sorber: The aqueous stream resulting from the above scrubbing process is then sent to the ethylene oxide de-sorber. Here, ethylene oxide is obtained as the overhead product, whereas the bottom product obtained is known as the ‘glycol bleed’. When ethylene oxide is scrubbed from the recycle gas with an aqueous solution, ethylene glycols (viz. mono-ethylene glycol, di-ethylene glycol and other poly-ethylene glycols) get unavoidably produced. Thus, in-order to prevent them from building up in the system, they are continuously bled off.  Stripping and distillation column: Here, the ethylene oxide stream is stripped off its low boiling components and then distilled in-order to separate it into water and ethylene oxide.  CO 2 scrubber: The recycle stream obtained from the ethylene oxide scrubber is compressed and a side-stream is fed to the CO 2 scrubber. Here, CO 2 gets dissolved into the hot aqueous solution of potassium carbonate (i.e. the scrubbing media). The dissolution of CO 2 is not only a physical phenomenon, but a chemical phenomenon as well, for, the CO 2 reacts with potassium carbonate to produce potassium hydrogen carbonate.  K 2 CO 3 + CO 2 + H 2 O → 2 KHCO 3  CO 2 de-scrubber: The above potassium carbonate solution (enriched with CO 2 ) is then sent to the CO 2 de-scrubber where CO 2 is de-scrubbed by stepwise (usually two steps) flashing. The first step is done to remove the hydrocarbon gases, and the second step is employed to strip off CO 2 .  World production of ethylene oxide  The world production of ethylene oxide was 20 million tonnes in 2009, 100 19 million tonnes in 2008 and 18 million tonnes in 2007. 101 This places ethylene oxide 14th most produced organic chemical, whereas the most produced one was ethylene with 113 million tonnes. 102 SRI Consulting forecasted the growth of consumption of ethylene oxide of 4.4% per year during 2008–2013 and 3% from 2013 to 2018. 103  In 2004, the global production of ethylene oxide by region was as follows: 104      Align = "center" Region   Align = "center" Number of major producers   Align = "center" Production, thousand tonnes     North America  United States  Canada  Mexico   10 3 3   4009 1084 350     South America  Brazil  Venezuela   2 1   312 82     Europe  Belgium  France  Germany  Netherlands  Spain  Turkey  United Kingdom  Eastern Europe   2 1 4 2 1 1 1 no data   770 215 995 460 100 115 300 950     Middle East  Iran  Kuwait  Saudi Arabia   2 1 2   201 350 1781     Asia  China  Taiwan  India  Indonesia  Japan  Malaysia  South Korea  Singapore   No data 4 2 1 4 1 3 1   1354 820 488 175 949 385 740 80     The world's largest producers of ethylene oxide are Dow Chemical Company (3–3.5 million tonnes in 2006 105 ), Saudi Basic Industries (2000–2500 tonnes in 2006 106 ), Royal Dutch Shell (1.328 million tonnes in 2008–2009 107 108 109 110 ), BASF (1.175 million tonnes in 2008–2009 111 ), China Petrochemical Corporation (~1 million tonnes in 2006 112 ), Formosa Plastics (~1 million tonnes in 2006 113 ) and Ineos (0.92 million tonnes in 2008–2009). 114  Applications  (Figure)  Global industrial use of ethylene oxide in 2007. 115   Ethylene oxide is one of the most important raw materials used in large-scale chemical production. Most ethylene oxide is used for synthesis of ethylene glycols , including diethylene glycol and triethylene glycol, that accounts for up to 75% of global consumption. Other important products include ethylene glycol ethers, ethanolamines and ethoxylates. Among glycols, ethylene glycol is used as antifreeze , in the production of polyester and polyethylene terephthalate (PET – raw material for plastic bottles), liquid coolants and solvents.

They are used in the manufacture of detergents, surfactants, emulsifiers and dispersants . 116  Whereas synthesis of ethylene glycols is the major application of ethylene oxide, its percentage varies greatly depending on the region: from 44% in the Western Europe , 63% in Japan and 73% in North America to 90% in the rest of Asia and 99% in Africa . 117  Production of ethylene glycol  Ethylene glycol is industrially produced by non-catalytic hydration of ethylene oxide at a temperature of 200 °C and a pressure of 1.5–2 MPa: 118   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + H 2 O → HOCH 2 CH 2 OH   By-products of the reaction are diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol and polyglycols with the total of about 10%, which are separated from the ethylene glycol by distillation at reduced pressure. 119  Another synthesis method is the reaction of ethylene oxide and CO 2 (temperature 80–120 °C and pressure of 5.2 MPa) yielding ethylene carbonate and its subsequent hydrolysis with decarboxylation: 120         (    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    )   𝖮   +   𝖢𝖮  𝟤    →    (    𝖮   -    𝖢𝖧  𝟤     𝖢𝖧  𝟤     -  𝖮   )    𝖢    =   𝖮      →   +    𝖧  𝟤   𝖮      -   𝖢𝖮  𝟤        𝖧𝖮𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤   𝖮𝖧        normal-→         subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮    subscript  𝖢𝖮  2        𝖮     subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮   𝖢        𝖮        subscript  𝖢𝖮  2          subscript  𝖧  2   𝖮    normal-→         subscript  𝖧𝖮𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2   𝖮𝖧      \mathsf{(CH_{2}CH_{2})O+CO_{2}}\rightarrow\mathsf{(O\!\!-\!\!CH_{2}CH_{2}\!\!-%

The glycol yield is 99–99.5%, with other glycols practically absent. The main advantage of the process is production of pure ethylene glycol without the need for further purification. The first commercial plant which uses this method was opened in 2008 in South Korea. 122 Dow METEOR (Most Effective Technology for Ethylene Oxide Reactions) is an integrated technology for producing ethylene oxide and its subsequent hydrolysis into ethylene glycol. The glycol yield is 90–93%. The main advantage of the process is relative simplicity, using fewer stages and less equipment.  Production of glycol ethers  The major industrial esters of mono-, di- and triethylene glycols are methyl, ethyl and normal butyl ethers, as well as their acetates and phthalates. The synthesis involves reaction of the appropriate alcohol with ethylene oxide: 123   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + ROH → HOCH 2 CH 2 OR    (CH 2 CH 2 )O + HOCH 2 CH 2 OR → HOCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 OR    (CH 2 CH 2 )O + HOCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 OR → HOCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 OCH 2 CH 2 OR   The reaction of monoesters with an acid or its anhydride leads to the formation of the esters:   CH 3 COOH + HOCH 2 CH 2 OR → ROCH 2 CH 2 OCOCH 3 + H 2 O   Production of ethanolamines  In the industry, ethanolamines (mono-, di- and triethanolamines) are produced by reacting ammonia and ethylene oxide in anhydrous medium at a temperature of 40–70 °C and pressure of 1.5–3.5 MPa: 124   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + NH 3 → HOCH 2 CH 2 NH 2     2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + NH 3 → (HOCH 2 CH 2 ) 2 NH    3 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + NH 3 → (HOCH 2 CH 2 ) 3 N   All three ethanolamines are produced in the process, while ammonia and part of methylamine are recycled. The final products are separated by vacuum distillation . Hydroxyalkylamines are produced in a similar process:   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + RNH 2 → HOCH 2 CH 2 NHR    2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + RNH 2 → (HOCH 2 CH 2 ) 2 NR   Monosubstituted products are formed by reacting a large excess of amine with ethylene oxide in presence of water and at a temperature below 100 °C. Disubstituted products are obtained with a small excess of ethylene oxide, at a temperature of 120–140 °C and a pressure of 0.3–0.5 MPa. 125 126  Production of ethoxylates  Industrial production of ethoxylates is realized by a direct reaction of higher alcohols, acids or amines with ethylene oxide in the presence of an alkaline catalyst at a temperature of 120–180 °C. Modern plants producing ethoxylates are usually based on the BUSS LOOP reactors technology, 127 which is based on a three-stage continuous process. In the first stage, the initiator or catalyst of the reaction and the feedstock are fed into the container, where they are mixed, heated and vacuum dried. Then reaction is carried out in a special insulated reactor in an inert atmosphere (nitrogen) to prevent a possible explosion of ethylene oxide. Finally, the reaction mixture is neutralized, degassed and purified. 128  Production of acrylonitrile  Currently, most acrylonitrile (90% in 2008) is produced by the SOHIO method, which is based on the catalytic oxidation of propylene in the presence of ammonia and bismuth phosphomolybdate. However, until 1960 a key production process was addition of hydrogen cyanide to ethylene oxide, followed by dehydration of the resulting cyanohydrin : 129  130         (    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    )   𝖮   +  𝖧𝖢𝖭   →    𝖧𝖮𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖧  𝟤    𝖢𝖭      →      -    𝖧  𝟤   𝖮       𝖢𝖧  𝟤    =    𝖢𝖧   -  𝖢𝖭        normal-→         subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2    𝖮   𝖧𝖢𝖭      subscript  𝖧𝖮𝖢𝖧  2    subscript  𝖢𝖧  2   𝖢𝖭           subscript  𝖧  2   𝖮     normal-→       subscript  𝖢𝖧  2          𝖢𝖧  𝖢𝖭      \mathsf{(CH_{2}CH_{2})O+HCN}\rightarrow\mathsf{HOCH_{2}CH_{2}CN\ \xrightarrow[%
 -H_{2}O]{\ }CH_{2}\!\!=\!\!CH\!\!-\!\!CN}     Addition of hydrocyanic acid to ethylene oxide is carried out in the presence of a catalyst ( sodium hydroxide and diethylamine ), and dehydration of cyanohydrin occurs in the gas phase upon the catalytic action of aluminium oxide . 131  Non-industrial uses  The direct use of ethylene oxide accounts for only 0.05% (2004 data) of its global production. 132 Ethylene oxide is used as a sterilizing agent, disinfecting agent and fumigant as a mixture with carbon dioxide (8.5–80% of ethylene oxide), nitrogen or dichlorodifluoromethane (12% ethylene oxide). It is applied for gas-phase sterilization of medical equipment and instruments, packaging materials and clothing, surgical and scientific equipment; 133 for processing of storage facilities (tobacco, packages of grain, sacks of rice, etc.), clothing, furs and valuable documents. 134  Healthcare sterilant  Ethylene oxide is one of the most commonly used sterilization methods in the healthcare industry because of its non-damaging effects for delicate instruments and devices that require sterilization, and for its wide range of material compatibility. 135 It is used for instruments that cannot tolerate heat, moisture or abrasive chemicals, such as electronics, optical equipment, paper, rubber and plastics. 136 It was developed in the 1940s as a sterilant by the US military, and its use as a medical sterilant dates to the late 50s, when the McDonald process was patented for medical devices. 137 The Anprolene system was patented in the 1960s 138 by Andersen Products, 139 and it remains the most commonly used system in several niche markets, notably the veterinary market and some international markets. 140 It relies on the use of a flexible sterilization chamber and an EtO cartridge for small volume sterilization, and where environmental and/or portability considerations dictate the use of a low dose. It is therefore referred to as the " flexible chamber sterilization " method, or the " gas diffusion sterilization " method. The operation of EtO sterilization is overseen by the EPA through the National Emission Standard for Hazardous Air Pollutants. 141  Niche uses  Ethylene oxide is used as an accelerator of maturation of tobacco leaves and fungicide . 142 Ethylene oxide is also used as a main component of thermobaric weapons (fuel-air explosives). 143 144 145  Ethylene is used in the synthesis in 2-butoxyethanol , which is a solvent used in many products. 146  Identification of ethylene oxide  Gas chromatography is the principal method for analysis and detection of ethylene oxide. 147  An inexpensive test for ethylene oxide exploits its precipitation of solids hydroxides of metals when it is passed through aqueous solutions of their salts:   2 (CH 2 CH 2 )O + MnCl 2 + 2 H 2 O → 2 HO–CH 2 CH 2 –Cl + Mn(OH) 2 ↓   Similarly, ethylene oxide is detected by the bright pink color of the indicator when passing air through aqueous solutions of some salts of sodium or potassium (chlorides, iodides, thiosulfates, etc.) with the addition of phenolphthalein : 148   (CH 2 CH 2 )O + NaCl + H 2 O → HO–CH 2 CH 2 –Cl + NaOH   Other methods of ethylene oxide detection are 149 color reactions with pyridine derivatives and hydrolysis of ethylene glycol with periodic acid . The produced iodic acid is detected with silver nitrate .  Fire and explosion hazards  Ethylene oxide is extremely flammable and its mixtures with air are explosive. When heated, it may rapidly expand causing fire and explosion. 150 The Autoignition temperature is 429 °C, decomposition temperature of 571 °C at 101.3 kPa, minimum inflammable content in the air is 2.7%, 151 and maximum limit is 100%. The NFPA rating is NFPA 704 . 152 Ethylene oxide in presence of water can hydrolyze to ethylene glycol and form poly ethylene oxide which then eventually gets oxidized by air and leads to hotspots that can trigger to explosive decomposition.  Fires caused by ethylene oxide are extinguished by traditional media, including foam , carbon dioxide or water. Suppression of this activity can be done by blanketing with an inert gas until total pressure reaches non explosive range. Extinguishing of burning ethylene oxide is complicated by that it can continue burning in an inert atmosphere and in water solutions. Fire suppression is reached only upon dilution with water above 22:1. 153  Physiological effects  Effect on microorganisms  The disinfectant effect of ethylene oxide is similar to that of sterilization by heat, but because of limited penetration, it affects only the surface.  Effects on humans and animals  Ethylene oxide is an alkylating agent ; it has irritating, sensitizing and narcotic effects. 154 Chronic exposure to ethylene oxide is also mutagenic . The International Agency for Research on Cancer classifies ethylene oxide into group 1, meaning it is a proven carcinogen . 155 156 Ethylene oxide is classified as a class 2 carcinogen by the German MAK commission and as a class A2 carcinogen by the ACGIH. A 2003 study of 7,576 women exposed while at work in commercial sterilization facilities in the U.S. suggests ethylene oxide is associated with breast cancer incidence. 157 A 2004 follow up study analyzing 18,235 men and women workers exposed to ethylene oxide from 1987 to 1998 concluded "There was little evidence of any excess cancer mortality for the cohort as a whole, with the exception of bone cancer based on small numbers. Positive exposure-response trends for lymphoid tumors were found for males only. Reasons for the sex specificity of this effect are not known. There was also some evidence of a positive exposure-response for breast cancer mortality." 158 An increased incidence of brain tumors and mononuclear cell leukemia was found in rats that had inhaled ethylene oxide at concentrations of 10, 33, or 100 mL/m 3 over a period of two years. 159 An increased incidence of peritoneal mesotheliomas was also observed in the animals exposed to concentrations of 33 and 100 mL/m 3 . Results of human epidemiological studies on workers exposed to ethylene oxide differ. There is evidence from both human and animal studies that inhalation exposure to ethylene oxide can result in a wide range of carcinogenic effects.  Ethylene oxide is toxic by inhalation with an U.S. OSHA permissible exposure limit calculated as a TWA (time weighted average) over 8 hours of 1 ppm, and a short term exposure limit (excursion limit) calculated as a TWA over 15 minutes of 5 ppm. 160 At concentrations in the air about 200 parts per million, ethylene oxide irritates mucous membranes of the nose and throat; higher contents cause damage to the trachea and bronchi, progressing into the partial collapse of the lungs. High concentrations can cause pulmonary edema and damage the cardiovascular system; the damaging effect of ethylene oxide may occur only after 72 hours after exposure. 161 The maximum content of ethylene oxide in the air according to the U.S. standards ( ACGIH ) is 1.8 mg/m 3 . 162  NIOSH has determined that the Immediately Dangerous to Life and Health level (IDLH) is 800 ppm. 163  Because the odor threshold for ethylene oxide varies between 250 and 700 ppm, the gas will already be at toxic concentrations when it can be smelled. Even then, the odor of ethylene oxide is sweet, aromatic, and can easily be mistaken for the pleasant aroma of diethyl ether , a common laboratory solvent of very low toxicity. In view of these insidious warning properties, continuous electrochemical monitors are standard practice, and it is forbidden to use ethylene oxide to fumigate building interiors in the EU and some other jurisdictions. 164  Ethylene oxide causes acute poisoning, accompanied by a variety of symptoms. 165 Central nervous system effects are frequently associated with human exposure to ethylene oxide in occupational settings. Headache, nausea and vomiting have been reported for more than fifty years. Peripheral neuropathy, impaired hand-eye coordination and memory loss have been reported in more recent case studies of chronically-exposed workers at estimated average exposure levels as low as 3 ppm (with possible short-term peaks as high as 700 ppm). 166 The metabolism of ethylene oxide is not completely known. Data from animal studies indicate two possible pathways for the metabolism of ethylene oxide: hydrolysis to ethylene glycol and glutathione conjugation to form mercapturic acid and meththio-metabolites.  Ethylene oxide easily penetrates through the clothing and footwear, causing skin irritation and dermatitis with the formation of blisters, fever and leukocytosis . 167  Toxicity data for ethylene oxide are as follows: 168   Eye exposure: 18 mg/6 hours (rabbit)  Oral: 72 mg/kg (rat, LD 50 ), 1186 mg/kg (rat, TD Lo ), 5112 mg/kg (rat, TD )  Inhalation: 12,500 ppm (human, TC Lo ), 960 ppm/4 hours (dog, LC 50 ) 33–50 ppm (rat or mouse, TC), 800 ppm/4 hours (rat or mouse, LC 50 )  Subcutaneous injection : 100 mg/kg (cat, LD Lo ), 292 mg/kg (mouse, TD Lo ) 900–2600 mg/kg (mouse, TD), 187 mg/kg (rat, LD 50 ).  Intraperitoneal injection : 750 mg/kg (mouse, TD Lo ), 175 mg/kg (mouse, LD 50 )  Intravenous injection: 175 mg/kg (rabbit, LD 50 ), 290 mg/kg (mouse, LD 50 )   Global demand  Global EO demand has expanded from 16.6 Mt (megatonne) in 2004 to 20 Mt in 2009, while demand for refined EO expanded from 4.64 Mt in 2004 to 5.6 Mt in 2008. In 2009, demand is estimated to have declined to about 5.2 Mt. Total EO demand registered a growth rate of 5.6% per annum during the period 2005 to 2009 and is projected to grow at 5.7% per annum during 2009 to 2013. 169  References  External links   EOSA Promoting the safe use of Ethylene Oxide for Sterilization  WebBook page for C2H4O  National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health – Ethylene Oxide Topic Page  CDC – NIOSH Pocket Guide to Chemical Hazards  EOSA memo about Ethylene Oxide (EtO) facts   "  Category:Epoxides  Category:Hazardous air pollutants  Category:IARC Group 1 carcinogens  Category:Monomers  Category:Occupational safety and health  Category:Suspected testicular toxicants  Category:Commodity chemicals  Category:Gaseous signaling molecules     ↩    Rebsdat, Siegfried and Mayer, Dieter (2005) "Ethylene Oxide" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry .
