   Fiber bundle      Fiber bundle   (Figure)  A cylindrical hairbrush showing the intuition behind the term "fiber bundle". This hairbrush is like a fiber bundle in which the base space is a cylinder and the fibers ( bristles ) are line segments. The mapping π: E → B would take a point on any bristle and map it to its root on the cylinder.   In mathematics , and particularly topology , a fiber bundle (or, in British English , fibre bundle ) is a space that is locally a product space , but globally may have a different topological structure . Specifically, the similarity between a space E and a product space B × F is defined using a continuous  surjective  map      π  :   E  →  B      normal-:  π   normal-→  E  B     \pi\colon E\to B     that in small regions of E behaves just like a projection from corresponding regions of B × F to B . The map π, called the projection or submersion of the bundle, is regarded as part of the structure of the bundle. The space E is known as the total space of the fiber bundle, B as the base space , and F the fiber .  In the trivial case, E is just B × F , and the map π is just the projection from the product space to the first factor. This is called a trivial bundle . Examples of non-trivial fiber bundles include the Möbius strip and Klein bottle , as well as nontrivial covering spaces . Fiber bundles such as the tangent bundle of a manifold and more general vector bundles play an important role in differential geometry and differential topology , as do principal bundles .  Mappings between total spaces of fiber bundles that "commute" with the projection maps are known as bundle maps , and the class of fiber bundles forms a category with respect to such mappings. A bundle map from the base space itself (with the identity mapping as projection) to E is called a section of E . Fiber bundles can be specialized in a number of ways, the most common of which is requiring that the transitions between the local trivial patches lie in a certain topological group , known as the structure group , acting on the fiber F .  Formal definition  A fiber bundle is a structure ( E , B , π, F ), where E , B , and F are topological spaces and π : E → B is a continuous  surjection satisfying a local triviality condition outlined below. The space B is called the base space of the bundle, E the total space , and F the fiber . The map π is called the projection map (or bundle projection). We shall assume in what follows that the base space B is connected .  We require that for every x in E , there is an open neighborhood  U ⊂ B of π( x ) (which will be called a trivializing neighborhood) such that there is a homeomorphism φ: π −1 ( U ) → U × F (where U × F is the product space) in such a way that π agrees with the projection onto the first factor. That is, the following diagram should commute :   Local triviality condition|230px   where proj 1 : U × F → U is the natural projection and φ : π −1 ( U ) → U × F is a homeomorphism. The set of all {( U i , φ i )} is called a local trivialization of the bundle.  Thus for any p in B , the preimage π −1 ({ p }) is homeomorphic to F (since proj 1 −1 ({ p }) clearly is) and is called the fiber over p . Every fiber bundle π : E → B is an open map , since projections of products are open maps. Therefore B carries the quotient topology determined by the map π.  A fiber bundle ( E , B , π, F ) is often denoted      F  ⟶   E     →  𝜋    B       normal-⟶  F  E     π  normal-→     B     F\longrightarrow E\ \xrightarrow{\,\ \pi\ }\ B   that, in analogy with a short exact sequence , indicates which space is the fiber, total space and base space, as well as the map from total to base space.  A smooth fiber bundle is a fiber bundle in the category of smooth manifolds . That is, E , B , and F are required to be smooth manifolds and all the functions above are required to be smooth maps .  Examples  Trivial bundle  Let E = B × F and let π : E → B be the projection onto the first factor. Then E is a fiber bundle (of F ) over B . Here E is not just locally a product but globally one. Any such fiber bundle is called a trivial bundle . Any fiber bundle over a contractible CW-complex is trivial.  Möbius strip  Perhaps the simplest example of a nontrivial bundle E is the Möbius strip . It has the circle that runs lengthwise along the center of the strip as a base B and a line segment for the fiber F , so the Möbius strip is a bundle of the line segment over the circle. A neighborhood U of a point x ∈ B is an arc; in the picture, this is the length of one of the squares. The preimage     π   -  1     (  U  )        superscript  π    1    U    \pi^{-1}(U)   in the picture is a (somewhat twisted) slice of the strip four squares wide and one long. The homeomorphism φ maps the preimage of U to a slice of a cylinder: curved, but not twisted.  The corresponding trivial bundle B × F would be a cylinder , but the Möbius strip has an overall "twist". Note that this twist is visible only globally; locally the Möbius strip and the cylinder are identical (making a single vertical cut in either gives the same space).  Klein bottle  A similar nontrivial bundle is the Klein bottle which can be viewed as a "twisted" circle bundle over another circle. The corresponding non-twisted (trivial) bundle is the 2- torus , S 1 × S 1 .     (Figure)  The Klein bottle immersed in three-dimensional space.   (Figure)  A torus.      Covering map  A covering space is a fiber bundle such that the bundle projection is a local homeomorphism . It follows that the fiber is a discrete space .  Vector and principal bundles  A special class of fiber bundles, called vector bundles , are those whose fibers are vector spaces (to qualify as a vector bundle the structure group of the bundle — see below — must be a linear group ). Important examples of vector bundles include the tangent bundle and cotangent bundle of a smooth manifold. From any vector bundle, one can construct the frame bundle of bases which is a principal bundle (see below).  Another special class of fiber bundles, called principal bundles , are bundles on whose fibers a free and transitive action by a group G is given, so that each fiber is a principal homogeneous space . The bundle is often specified along with the group by referring to it as a principal G -bundle. The group G is also the structure group of the bundle. Given a representation ρ of G on a vector space V , a vector bundle with ρ( G )⊆Aut( V ) as a structure group may be constructed, known as the associated bundle .  Sphere bundles  A sphere bundle is a fiber bundle whose fiber is an n -sphere . Given a vector bundle E with a metric (such as the tangent bundle to a Riemannian manifold ) one can construct the associated unit sphere bundle , for which the fiber over a point x is the set of all unit vectors in E x . When the vector bundle in question is the tangent bundle T( M ), the unit sphere bundle is known as the unit tangent bundle , and is denoted UT( M ). A sphere bundle is partially characterized by its Euler class , which is a degree n +1 cohomology class in the total space of the bundle. In the case n =1 the sphere bundle is called a circle bundle and the Euler class is equal to the first Chern class , which characterizes the topology of the bundle completely. For any n , given the Euler class of a bundle, one can calculate its cohomology using a long exact sequence called the Gysin sequence .  See also: Wang sequence  Mapping tori  If X is a topological space and f : X → X is a homeomorphism then the mapping torus  M f has a natural structure of a fiber bundle over the circle with fiber X . Mapping tori of homeomorphisms of surfaces are of particular importance in 3-manifold topology .  Quotient spaces  If G is a topological group and H is a closed subgroup , then under some circumstances, the quotient space  G / H together with the quotient map π : G → G / H is a fiber bundle, whose fiber is the topological space H . A necessary and sufficient condition for ( G , G / H ,π, H ) to form a fiber bundle is that the mapping π admit local cross-sections .  The most general conditions under which the quotient map will admit local cross-sections are not known, although if G is a Lie group and H a closed subgroup (and thus a Lie subgroup by Cartan's theorem ), then the quotient map is a fiber bundle. One example of this is the Hopf fibration , S 3 → S 2 which is a fiber bundle over the sphere S 2 whose total space is S 3 . From the perspective of Lie groups, S 3 can be identified with the special unitary group SU(2). The abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to the circle group U(1), and the quotient SU(2)/U(1) is diffeomorphic to the sphere.  More generally, if G is any topological group and H a closed subgroup which also happens to be a Lie group, then G → G / H is a fiber bundle.  Sections  A section (or cross section ) of a fiber bundle π is a continuous map f : B → E such that π( f ( x ))= x for all x in B . Since bundles do not in general have globally defined sections, one of the purposes of the theory is to account for their existence. The obstruction to the existence of a section can often be measured by a cohomology class, which leads to the theory of characteristic classes in algebraic topology .  The most well-known example is the hairy ball theorem , where the Euler class is the obstruction to the tangent bundle of the 2-sphere having a nowhere vanishing section.  Often one would like to define sections only locally (especially when global sections do not exist). A local section of a fiber bundle is a continuous map f : U → E where U is an open set in B and π( f ( x ))= x for all x in U . If ( U , φ) is a local trivialization chart then local sections always exist over U . Such sections are in 1-1 correspondence with continuous maps U → F . Sections form a sheaf .  Structure groups and transition functions  Fiber bundles often come with a group of symmetries which describe the matching conditions between overlapping local trivialization charts. Specifically, let G be a topological group which acts continuously on the fiber space F on the left. We lose nothing if we require G to act effectively on F so that it may be thought of as a group of homeomorphisms of F . A G - atlas for the bundle ( E , B , π, F ) is a local trivialization such that for any two overlapping charts ( U i , φ i ) and ( U j , φ j ) the function        φ  i    φ  j   -  1     :     (    U  i   ∩   U  j    )   ×  F   →    (    U  i   ∩   U  j    )   ×  F       normal-:     subscript  φ  i    superscript   subscript  φ  j     1      normal-→       subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j    F        subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j    F      \varphi_{i}\varphi_{j}^{-1}\colon(U_{i}\cap U_{j})\times F\to(U_{i}\cap U_{j})\times
 F   is given by        φ  i    φ  j   -  1     (  x  ,  ξ  )    =   (  x  ,    t   i  j     (  x  )   ξ   )          subscript  φ  i    superscript   subscript  φ  j     1     x  ξ     x     subscript  t    i  j    x  ξ      \varphi_{i}\varphi_{j}^{-1}(x,\xi)=(x,t_{ij}(x)\xi)   where t ij : U i ∩ U j → G is a continuous map called a transition function . Two G -atlases are equivalent if their union is also a G -atlas. A G -bundle is a fiber bundle with an equivalence class of G -atlases. The group G is called the structure group of the bundle; the analogous term in physics is gauge group .  In the smooth category, a G -bundle is a smooth fiber bundle where G is a Lie group and the corresponding action on F is smooth and the transition functions are all smooth maps.  The transition functions t ij satisfy the following conditions         t   i  i     (  x  )    =   1          subscript  t    i  i    x   1    t_{ii}(x)=1\,           t   i  j     (  x  )    =    t   j  i       (  x  )    -  1             subscript  t    i  j    x      subscript  t    j  i     superscript  x    1       t_{ij}(x)=t_{ji}(x)^{-1}\,            t   i  k     (  x  )    =    t   i  j     (  x  )    t   j  k     (  x  )     .         subscript  t    i  k    x      subscript  t    i  j    x   subscript  t    j  k    x     t_{ik}(x)=t_{ij}(x)t_{jk}(x).\,      The third condition applies on triple overlaps U i ∩ U j ∩ U k and is called the cocycle condition (see Čech cohomology ). The importance of this is that the transition functions determine the fiber bundle (if one assumes the Čech cocycle condition).  A principal G -bundle is a G -bundle where the fiber F is a principal homogeneous space for the left action of G itself (equivalently, one can specify that the action of G on the fiber F is free and transitive). In this case, it is often a matter of convenience to identify F with G and so obtain a (right) action of G on the principal bundle.  Bundle maps  It is useful to have notions of a mapping between two fiber bundles. Suppose that M and N are base spaces, and π E : E → M and π F : F → N are fiber bundles over M and N , respectively. A bundle map (or bundle morphism ) consists of a pair of continuous 1 functions      φ  :   E  →   F  ,  f    :   M  →  N        normal-:  φ   normal-→  E   F  f      normal-:     normal-→  M  N      \varphi\colon E\to F,\quad f\colon M\to N   such that      π  F   ∘  φ   =   f  ∘   π  E           subscript  π  F   φ     f   subscript  π  E      \pi_{F}\circ\varphi=f\circ\pi_{E}   . That is, the following diagram commutes :  For fiber bundles with structure group G and whose total spaces are (right) G -spaces (such as a principal bundle), bundle morphisms are also required to be G - equivariant on the fibers. This means that    φ  :   E  →  F      normal-:  φ   normal-→  E  F     \varphi\colon E\to F   is also G -morphism from one G -space to another, i.e.,     φ   (   x  s   )    =   φ   (  x  )   s         φ    x  s      φ  x  s     \varphi(xs)=\varphi(x)s   for all    x  ∈  E      x  E    x\in E   and    s  ∈  G      s  G    s\in G   .  In case the base spaces M and N coincide, then a bundle morphism over M from the fiber bundle π E : E → M to π F : F → M is a map φ : E → F such that     π  E   =    π  F   ∘  φ        subscript  π  E      subscript  π  F   φ     \pi_{E}=\pi_{F}\circ\varphi   . This means that the bundle map φ : E → F covers the identity of M . That is,    f  ≡   id  M       f   subscript  id  M     f\equiv{\mathrm{id}}_{M}   and the diagram commutes  Assume that both π E : E → M and π F : F → M are defined over the same base space M . A bundle isomorphism is a bundle map    (  φ  ,  f  )     φ  f    (\varphi,f)   between π E : E → M and π F : F → M such that    f  ≡   id  M       f   subscript  id  M     f\equiv{\mathrm{id}}_{M}   and such that φ is also a homeomorphism. 2  Differentiable fiber bundles  In the category of differentiable manifolds , fiber bundles arise naturally as submersions of one manifold to another. Not every (differentiable) submersion ƒ : M → N from a differentiable manifold M to another differentiable manifold N gives rise to a differentiable fiber bundle. For one thing, the map must be surjective, and ( M , N ,ƒ) is called a fibered manifold . However, this necessary condition is not quite sufficient, and there are a variety of sufficient conditions in common use.  If M and N are compact and connected, then any submersion f : M → N gives rise to a fiber bundle in the sense that there is a fiber space F diffeomorphic to each of the fibers such that ( E , B ,π, F ) = ( M , N ,ƒ, F ) is a fiber bundle. (Surjectivity of ƒ follows by the assumptions already given in this case.) More generally, the assumption of compactness can be relaxed if the submersion ƒ : M → N is assumed to be a surjective proper map , meaning that ƒ −1 ( K ) is compact for every compact subset K of N . Another sufficient condition, due to , is that if ƒ : M → N is a surjective submersion with M and N  differentiable manifolds such that the preimage ƒ −1 { x } is compact and connected for all x ∈ N , then ƒ admits a compatible fiber bundle structure .  Generalizations   The notion of a bundle applies to many more categories in mathematics, at the expense of appropriately modifying the local triviality condition; cf. principal homogeneous space and torsor (algebraic geometry) .  In topology, a fibration is a mapping π : E → B which has certain homotopy-theoretic properties in common with fiber bundles. Specifically, under mild technical assumptions a fiber bundle always has the homotopy lifting property or homotopy covering property (see  for details). This is the defining property of a fibration.
