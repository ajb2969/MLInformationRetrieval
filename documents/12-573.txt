Weber's modular functions

 
  named after the mathematician H. M. Weber
Weber functions Eν are solutions of an inhomogeneous Bessel equation, and are linear combinations of Anger functions if ν is not an integer, or linear combinations of Struve functions if ν is an integer
Weber–Hermite function is another name for parabolic cylinder functions, which are solutions of Weber's (differential) equation
