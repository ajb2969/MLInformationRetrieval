   Weber function      Weber function   In mathematics, Weber function can refer to several different families of functions, mostly named after the physicist H. F. Weber or the mathematician H. M. Weber :   Weber's modular functions     f  ,   f  1   ,   f  2      f   subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2     f,f_{1},f_{2}   named after the mathematician H. M. Weber  Weber functions E ν are solutions of an inhomogeneous Bessel equation, and are linear combinations of Anger functions if ν is not an integer, or linear combinations of Struve functions if ν is an integer  Weber–Hermite function is another name for parabolic cylinder functions, which are solutions of Weber's (differential) equation   "
