   Glycoprotein O-fatty-acyltransferase      Glycoprotein O-fatty-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycoprotein O-fatty-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   palmitoyl-CoA + mucus glycoprotein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + O-palmitoylglycoprotein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are palmitoyl-CoA and mucus glycoprotein , whereas its two products are CoA and O-palmitoylglycoprotein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is fatty-acyl-CoA:mucus-glycoprotein fatty-acyltransferase . This enzyme is also called protein acyltransferase .
