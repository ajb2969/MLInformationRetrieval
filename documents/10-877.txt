   2-alkenal reductase      2-alkenal reductase   In enzymology , a 2-alkenal reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   n-alkanal + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   alk-2-enal + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are n-alkanal , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are alk-2-enal , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is n-alkanal:NAD(P)+ 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NAD(P)H-dependent alkenal/one oxidoreductase , and NADPH:2-alkenal alpha,beta-hydrogenase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
