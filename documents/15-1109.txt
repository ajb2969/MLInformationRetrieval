Phenylalanine N-monooxygenase

Phenylalanine N-monooxygenase (, phenylalanine N-hydroxylase, CYP79A2) is an enzyme with system name L-phenylalanine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (N-hydroxylating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-phenylalanine + 2 O2 + 2 NADPH + 2 H+

 
  (E)-phenylacetaldoxime + 2 NADP+ + CO2 + 3 H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) L-phenylalanine + O2 + NADPH + H+

 
  N-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine + NADP+ + H2O:
 
(1b) N-hydroxy-L-phenylalanine + O2 + NADPH + H+

 
  N,N-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine + NADP+ + H2O
 
(1c) N,N-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine 
 
 
 
  (E)-phenylacetaldoxime + CO2 + H2O
 

Phenylalanine N-monooxygenase is a heme-thiolate protein (P-450).
