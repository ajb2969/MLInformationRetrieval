   Primitive element (co-algebra)      Primitive element (co-algebra)   In algebra, a primitive element of a co-algebra  C (over an element g ) is an element x that satisfies       μ   (  x  )    =    x  ⊗  g   +   g  ⊗  x          μ  x      tensor-product  x  g    tensor-product  g  x      \mu(x)=x\otimes g+g\otimes x   where   μ   μ   \mu   is the co-multiplication and g is an element of C that maps to the multiplicative identity 1 of the base field under the co-unit ( g is called group-like). C is said to be primitively generated if it is generated by primitive elements.  If C is a bi-algebra ; i.e., a co-algebra that is also an algebra, then one usually takes g to be 1, the multiplicative identity of C .  If C is a bi-algebra, then the set of primitive elements form a Lie algebra with the usual commutator bracket     [  x  ,  y  ]   =    x  y   -   y  x         x  y       x  y     y  x      [x,y]=xy-yx   ( graded commutator if C is graded.)  If A is a (certain graded) Hopf algebra over a field of characteristic zero, then the Milnor–Moore theorem states the universal enveloping algebra of the graded Lie algebra of primitive elements of A is isomorphic to A .
