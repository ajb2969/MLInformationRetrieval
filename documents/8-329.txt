   Zero-stage      Zero-stage   Jet engines are often uprated by adding a zero-stage to the front of a compressor . 1  At a given core size, adding a stage to the front of the compressor not only increases the cycle overall pressure ratio , but increases the core mass flow.  This is demonstrated by the following relationship:       w  2   =    (     w  2     T  3     /   P  3    )   *   (    P  3   /   P  2    )   *   (     T  2   /   T  3     )   *   (    P  2   /    T  2     )         subscript  w  2          subscript  w  2      subscript  T  3      subscript  P  3       subscript  P  3    subscript  P  2         subscript  T  2    subscript  T  3        subscript  P  2      subscript  T  2        w_{2}=(w_{2}\sqrt{T_{3}}/P_{3})*(P_{3}/P_{2})*(\sqrt{T_{2}/T_{3}})*(P_{2}/%
 \sqrt{T_{2}})\,     where:  core mass flow =      w  2      subscript  w  2    w_{2}\,     core size =     (     w  2     T  3     /   P  3    )         subscript  w  2      subscript  T  3      subscript  P  3     (w_{2}\sqrt{T_{3}}/P_{3})\,     core total head pressure ratio =     (    P  3   /   P  2    )       subscript  P  3    subscript  P  2     (P_{3}/P_{2})\,     inverse of core total head temperature ratio =      T  2   /    T  3         subscript  T  2    subscript  T  3     T_{2}/T_{3}\,    i.e. f(      P  3   /    P  2         subscript  P  3    subscript  P  2     P_{3}/P_{2}\,    )  core entry total pressure =      P  2      subscript  P  2    P_{2}\,     core entry total temperature =      T  2      subscript  T  2    T_{2}\,     So basically, increasing     (    P  3   /   P  2    )       subscript  P  3    subscript  P  2     (P_{3}/P_{2})\,    increases      w  2      subscript  w  2    w_{2}\,    .  On the other hand, adding a stage to the rear of the compressor increases overall pressure ratio, decreases core size, but has no effect on core flow. This option also needs a Turbine with a significantly smaller flow capacity to drive the compressor.  References  "  Category:Jet engines     Hooker, Sir Stanley (1984).
