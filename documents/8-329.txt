Zero-stage




Zero-stage

Jet engines are often uprated by adding a zero-stage to the front of a compressor.1
At a given core size, adding a stage to the front of the compressor not only increases the cycle overall pressure ratio, but increases the core mass flow.
This is demonstrated by the following relationship:



where:
core mass flow = 


core size =


core total head pressure ratio = 


inverse of core total head temperature ratio = 

 i.e. f(

)
core entry total pressure = 


core entry total temperature = 


So basically, increasing 

 increases 

.
On the other hand, adding a stage to the rear of the compressor increases overall pressure ratio, decreases core size, but has no effect on core flow. This option also needs a Turbine with a significantly smaller flow capacity to drive the compressor.
