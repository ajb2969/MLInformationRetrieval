   Gibbs–Helmholtz equation      Gibbs–Helmholtz equation   The Gibbs–Helmholtz equation is a thermodynamic  equation used for calculating changes in the Gibbs energy of a system as a function of temperature . It is named after Josiah Willard Gibbs and Hermann von Helmholtz .  Equation  The equation is: 1  where H is the enthalpy , T the absolute temperature and G the Gibbs free energy of the system, all at constant pressure  p . The equation states that the change in the G/T ratio at constant pressure as a result of an infinitesimally small change in temperature is a factor H/T 2 ..  Chemical reactions  The typical applications are to chemical reactions . The equation reads: 2        (    ∂   (    Δ   G  ⊖    /  T   )     ∂  T    )   p   =   -    Δ  H    T  2          subscript          normal-Δ   superscript  G  symmetric-difference    T      T    p         normal-Δ  H    superscript  T  2       \left(\frac{\partial(\Delta G^{\ominus}/T)}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=-\frac{%
 \Delta H}{T^{2}}     with Δ G as the change in Gibbs energy and Δ H as the enthalpy change (considered independent of temperature). The o denotes standard pressure (1 bar).  Integrating with respect to T (again p is constant) it becomes:         Δ   G  ⊖    (   T  2   )     T  2    -    Δ   G  ⊖    (   T  1   )     T  1     =   Δ   H  ⊖    (  p  )    (    1   T  2    -   1   T  1     )              normal-Δ   superscript  G  symmetric-difference    subscript  T  2     subscript  T  2        normal-Δ   superscript  G  symmetric-difference    subscript  T  1     subscript  T  1       normal-Δ   superscript  H  symmetric-difference   p      1   subscript  T  2      1   subscript  T  1        \frac{\Delta G^{\ominus}(T_{2})}{T_{2}}-\frac{\Delta G^{\ominus}(T_{1})}{T_{1}%
 }=\Delta H^{\ominus}(p)\left(\frac{1}{T_{2}}-\frac{1}{T_{1}}\right)     This equation quickly enables the calculation of the Gibbs free energy change for a chemical reaction at any temperature T 2 with knowledge of just the Standard Gibbs free energy change of formation and the Standard enthalpy change of formation for the individual components.  Also, using the reaction isotherm equation, 3 that is        Δ   G  ⊖    T   =   -   R   ln  K             normal-Δ   superscript  G  symmetric-difference    T       R    K       \frac{\Delta G^{\ominus}}{T}=-R\ln K     which relates the Gibbs energy to a chemical equilibrium constant , the van 't Hoff equation can be derived. 4  Derivation  Background  The definition of the Gibbs function is      H  =   G  +   S  T        H    G    S  T      H=G+ST\,\!     where H is the enthalpy defined by:      H  =   U  +   p  V        H    U    p  V      H=U+pV\,\!     Taking differentials of each definition to find dH and dG , then using the fundamental thermodynamic relation , aka "master equation" (always true for reversible or irreversible  processes ):       d  U   =    T  d  S   -   p  d  V          d  U       T  d  S     p  d  V      dU=TdS-pdV\,\!     where S is the entropy , V is volume , (minus sign due to reversibility, in which dU = 0: work other than pressure-volume may be done and is equal to − pV ) leads to the "reversed" form of the initial fundamental relation into a new master equation:       d  G   =    -   S  d  T    +   V  d  p          d  G         S  d  T      V  d  p      dG=-SdT+Vdp\,\!     This is the Gibbs free energy for a closed system. The Gibbs–Helmholtz equation can be derived by this second master equation, and the chain rule for partial derivatives . 5        Derivation       Starting from the equation       d  G   =    -   S  d  T    +   V  d  p    =      ∂  G    ∂  T    d  T   +     ∂  G    ∂  p    d  p            d  G         S  d  T      V  d  p                 G     T    d  T         G     p    d  p       dG=-SdT+Vdp=\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}dT+\frac{\partial G}{\partial p}dp\,\!   at constant pressure meaning dp = 0. Then dG reduces to         d   G  p    =   -   S  d  T    =     (    ∂  G    ∂  T    )   p   d  T      →   -  S    =    (    ∂  G    ∂  T    )   p     .     formulae-sequence        d   subscript  G  p        S  d  T            subscript      G     T    p   d  T        normal-→    S     subscript      G     T    p      dG_{p}=-SdT=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p}dT\quad\rightarrow%
 \quad-S=\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p}.\,\!   The dependence of the ratio G/T on T is found by the product rule of differentiation :        (    ∂   (   G  /  T   )     ∂  T    )   p   =     1  T     (    ∂  G    ∂  T    )   p    +   G    ∂   (   T   -  1    )     ∂  T      =     T    (     ∂  G    ∂  T     )   p    -  G    T  2    =     -   S  T    -  G    T  2    =   -   H   T  2            subscript        G  T      T    p         1  T    subscript      G     T    p      G       superscript  T    1       T                 T   subscript      G     T    p    G    superscript  T  2                 S  T    G    superscript  T  2             H   superscript  T  2        \left(\frac{\partial(G/T)}{\partial T}\right)_{p}=\frac{1}{T}\left(\frac{%
 \partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p}+G\frac{\partial(T^{-1})}{\partial T}=\dfrac%
 {T\left(\dfrac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_{p}-G}{T^{2}}=\frac{-ST-G}{T^{2}%
