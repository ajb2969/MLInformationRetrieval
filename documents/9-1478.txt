   Borell–Brascamp–Lieb inequality      Borell–Brascamp–Lieb inequality   In mathematics , the Borell–Brascamp–Lieb inequality is an integral  inequality due to many different mathematicians but named after Christer Borell , Herm Jan Brascamp and Elliott Lieb .  The result was proved for p > 0 by Henstock and Macbeath in 1953. The case p = 0 is known as the Prékopa–Leindler inequality and was re-discovered by Brascamp and Lieb in 1976, when they proved the general version below; working independently, Borell had done the same in 1975. The nomenclature of "Borell–Brascamp–Lieb inequality" is due to Cordero-Erausquin, McCann and Schmuckenschläger, who in 2001 generalized the result to Riemannian manifolds such as the sphere and hyperbolic space .  Statement of the inequality in R n  Let 0 n → [0, +∞) be integrable functions such that, for all x and y in R n ,        h   (     (   1  -  λ   )   x   +   λ  y    )    ≥    M  p    (   f   (  x  )    ,   g   (  y  )    ,  λ  )     ,        h        1  λ   x     λ  y        subscript  M  p      f  x     g  y   λ      h\left((1-\lambda)x+\lambda y\right)\geq M_{p}\left(f(x),g(y),\lambda\right),     where       M  p    (  a  ,  b  ,  λ  )        subscript  M  p    a  b  λ     \displaystyle M_{p}(a,b,\lambda)     Then         ∫   ℝ  n     h   (  x  )   d  x    ≥    M   p  /   (    n  p   +  1   )      (    ∫   ℝ  n     f   (  x  )   d  x    ,    ∫   ℝ  n     g   (  x  )   d  x    ,  λ  )     .        subscript    superscript  ℝ  n      h  x  normal-d  x       subscript  M    p      n  p   1        subscript    superscript  ℝ  n      f  x  normal-d  x      subscript    superscript  ℝ  n      g  x  normal-d  x    λ      \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}h(x)\,\mathrm{d}x\geq M_{p/(np+1)}\left(\int_{\mathbb{R}^%
 {n}}f(x)\,\mathrm{d}x,\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}}g(x)\,\mathrm{d}x,\lambda\right).     (When p = −1 / n , the convention is to take p / ( n  p + 1) to be −∞; when p = +∞, it is taken to be 1 / n .)  References         "  Category:Geometric inequalities  Category:Integral geometry
