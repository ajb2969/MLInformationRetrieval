   Hoeffding's independence test      Hoeffding's independence test   In statistics , Hoeffding's test of independence , named after Wassily Hoeffding , is a test based on the population measure of deviation from independence      H  =   ∫      (    F  12   -    F  1    F  2     )   2    d    F  12          H       superscript     subscript  F  12      subscript  F  1    subscript  F  2     2   d   subscript  F  12       H=\int(F_{12}-F_{1}F_{2})^{2}\,dF_{12}\!     where    F  12     subscript  F  12    F_{12}   is the joint distribution function of two random variables, and    F  1     subscript  F  1    F_{1}   and    F  2     subscript  F  2    F_{2}   are their marginal distribution functions. Hoeffding derived an unbiased estimator of   H   H   H   that can be used to test for independence , and is consistent for any continuous alternative . The test should only be applied to data drawn from a continuous distribution , since   H   H   H   has a defect for discontinuous    F  12     subscript  F  12    F_{12}   , namely that it is not necessarily zero when     F  12   =    F  1    F  2         subscript  F  12      subscript  F  1    subscript  F  2      F_{12}=F_{1}F_{2}   .  A recent paper 1 describes both the calculation of a sample based version of this measure for use as a test statistic, and calculation of the null distribution of this test statistic.
