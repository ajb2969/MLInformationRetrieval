Hoeffding's independence test

In statistics, Hoeffding's test of independence, named after Wassily Hoeffding, is a test based on the population measure of deviation from independence



where 
 
 
 
  is the joint distribution function of two random variables, and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are their marginal distribution functions. Hoeffding derived an unbiased estimator of 
 
 
 
  that can be used to test for independence, and is consistent for any continuous alternative. The test should only be applied to data drawn from a continuous distribution, since 
 
 
 
  has a defect for discontinuous 
 
 
 
 , namely that it is not necessarily zero when 
 
 
 
 .
A recent paper1 describes both the calculation of a sample based version of this measure for use as a test statistic, and calculation of the null distribution of this test statistic.
