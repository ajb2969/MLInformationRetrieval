   Conformal vector field      Conformal vector field   A conformal vector field (often conformal Killing vector field and occasionally conformal or conformal collineation ) of a Riemannian manifold     (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   is a vector field    X   X   X   that satisfies:        ℒ  X   g   =   φ  g          subscript  ℒ  X   g     φ  g     \mathcal{L}_{X}g=\varphi g     for some smooth real-valued function   φ   φ   \varphi   on   M   M   M   , where     ℒ  X   g       subscript  ℒ  X   g    \mathcal{L}_{X}g   denotes the Lie derivative of the metric   g   g   g   with respect to   X   X   X   . In the case that   φ   φ   \varphi   is identically zero,   X   X   X   is called a Killing vector field .
