Conformal vector field

A conformal vector field (often conformal Killing vector field and occasionally conformal or conformal collineation) of a Riemannian manifold

 
  is a vector field

 
  that satisfies:



for some smooth real-valued function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Lie derivative of the metric 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
 . In the case that 
 
 
 
  is identically zero, 
 
 
 
  is called a Killing vector field.
