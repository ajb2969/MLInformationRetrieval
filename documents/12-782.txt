   Plancherel theorem for spherical functions      Plancherel theorem for spherical functions   In mathematics , the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions is an important result in the representation theory of semisimple Lie groups , due in its final form to Harish-Chandra . It is a natural generalisation in non-commutative harmonic analysis of the Plancherel formula and Fourier inversion formula in the representation theory of the group of real numbers in classical harmonic analysis and has a similarly close interconnection with the theory of differential equations . It is the special case for zonal spherical functions of the general Plancherel theorem for semisimple Lie groups, also proved by Harish-Chandra. The Plancherel theorem gives the eigenfunction expansion of radial functions for the Laplacian operator on the associated symmetric space  X ; it also gives the direct integral decomposition into irreducible representations of the regular representation on L 2 ( X ). In the case of hyperbolic space , these expansions were known from prior results of Mehler, Weyl and Fock .  The main reference for almost all this material is the encyclopedic text of .  History  The first versions of an abstract Plancherel formula for the Fourier transform on a unimodular  locally compact group  G were due to Segal and Mautner. 1 At around the same time, Harish-Chandra 2 3 and Gelfand & Naimark 4 5 derived an explicit formula for SL(2,R) and complex semisimple Lie groups , so in particular the Lorentz groups . A simpler abstract formula was derived by Mautner for a "topological" symmetric space G / K corresponding to a maximal compact subgroup  K . Godement gave a more concrete and satisfactory form for positive definite  spherical functions , a class of special functions on G / K . Since when G is a semisimple Lie group these spherical functions φ λ were naturally labelled by a parameter λ in the quotient of a Euclidean space by the action of a finite reflection group , it became a central problem to determine explicitly the Plancherel measure in terms of this parametrization. Generalizing the ideas of Hermann Weyl from the spectral theory of ordinary differential equations , Harish-Chandra 6 7 introduced his celebrated c-function  c (λ) to describe the asymptotic behaviour of the spherical functions φ λ and proposed c (λ) −2  d λ as the Plancherel measure. He verified this formula for the special cases when G is complex or real rank one, thus in particular covering the case when G / K is a hyperbolic space . The general case was reduced to two conjectures about the properties of the c-function and the so-called spherical Fourier transform. Explicit formulas for the c-function were later obtained for a large class of classical semisimple Lie groups by Bhanu-Murthy. In turn these formulas prompted Gindikin and Karpelevič to derive a product formula 8 for the c-function, reducing the computation to Harish-Chandra's formula for the rank 1 case. Their work finally enabled Harish-Chandra to complete his proof of the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions in 1966. 9  In many special cases, for example for complex semisimple group or the Lorentz groups, there are simple methods to develop the theory directly. Certain subgroups of these groups can be treated by techniques generalising the well-known " method of descent " due to Jacques Hadamard . In particular  gave a general method for deducing properties of the spherical transform for a real semisimple group from that of its complexification.  One of the principal applications and motivations for the spherical transform was Selberg's trace formula . The classical Poisson summation formula combines the Fourier inversion formula on a vector group with summation over a cocompact lattice. In Selberg's analogue of this formula, the vector group is replaced by G / K , the Fourier transform by the spherical transform and the lattice by a cocompact (or cofinite) discrete subgroup. The original paper of  implicitly invokes the spherical transform; it was  who brought the transform to the fore, giving in particular an elementary treatment for SL(2, R ) along the lines sketched by Selberg.  Spherical functions  Let G be a semisimple  Lie group and K a maximal compact subgroup of G . The Hecke algebra  C c ( K \ G / K ), consisting of compactly supported K -biinvariant continuous functions on G , acts by convolution on the Hilbert space  H = L 2 ( G / K ). Because G / K is a symmetric space , this *-algebra is commutative . The closure of its (the Hecke algebra's) image in the operator norm is a non-unital commutative C* algebra    𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   , so by the Gelfand isomorphism can be identified with the continuous functions vanishing at infinity on its spectrum  X . 10 Points in the spectrum are given by continuous *-homomorphisms of   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   into C , i.e. characters of   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   .  If S ' denotes the commutant of a set of operators S on H , then    𝔄  ′     superscript  𝔄  normal-′    \mathfrak{A}^{\prime}   can be identified with the commutant of the regular representation of G on H . Now   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   leaves invariant the subspace H 0 of K -invariant vectors in H . Moreover the abelian von Neumann algebra it generates on H 0 is maximal Abelian. By spectral theory , there is an essentially unique 11  measure μ on the locally compact space X and a unitary transformation U between H 0 and L 2 ( X , μ) which carries the operators in   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   onto the corresponding multiplication operators .  The transformation U is called the spherical Fourier transform or sometimes just the spherical transform and μ is called the Plancherel measure . The Hilbert space H 0 can be identified with L 2 ( K \ G / K ), the space of K -biinvariant square integrable functions on G .  The characters χ λ of   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   (i.e. the points of X ) can be described by positive definite  spherical functions φ λ on G , via the formula         χ  λ    (   π   (  f  )    )    =    ∫  G      f   (  g  )    ⋅   φ  λ     (  g  )   d  g     .         subscript  χ  λ     π  f      subscript   G      normal-⋅    f  g    subscript  φ  λ    g  d  g      \chi_{\lambda}(\pi(f))=\int_{G}f(g)\cdot\varphi_{\lambda}(g)\,dg.     for f in C c ( K \ G / K ), where π( f ) denotes the convolution operator in   𝔄   𝔄   \mathfrak{A}   and the integral is with respect to Haar measure on G .  The spherical functions φ λ on G are given by Harish-Chandra's formula :               φ  λ    (  g  )    =    ∫  K     λ  ′      (   g  k   )    -  1     d  k     .         subscript  φ  λ   g     subscript   K      superscript  λ  normal-′    superscript    g  k     1    d  k      \varphi_{\lambda}(g)=\int_{K}\lambda^{\prime}(gk)^{-1}\,dk.          In this formula:   the integral is with respect to Haar measure on K ;  λ is an element of A * =Hom( A , T ) where A is the Abelian vector subgroup in the Iwasawa decomposition  G = KAN of G ;  λ' is defined on G by first extending λ to a character of the solvable subgroup  AN , using the group homomorphism onto A , and then setting           λ  ′    (   k  x   )    =    Δ   A  N      (  x  )    1  /  2    λ   (  x  )           superscript  λ  normal-′     k  x       subscript  normal-Δ    A  N     superscript  x    1  2    λ  x     \lambda^{\prime}(kx)=\Delta_{AN}(x)^{1/2}\lambda(x)         for k in K and x in AN , where Δ AN is the modular function of AN .    Two different characters λ 1 and λ 2 give the same spherical function if and only if λ 1 = λ 2 · s , where s is in the Weyl group of A          W  =      N  K    (  A  )    /   C  K     (  A  )     ,      W         subscript  N  K   A    subscript  C  K    A     W=N_{K}(A)/C_{K}(A),         the quotient of the normaliser of A in K by its centraliser , a finite reflection group .   It follows that   X can be identified with the quotient space A */ W .   Spherical principal series  The spherical function φ λ can be identified with the matrix coefficient of the spherical principal series of G . If M is the centralizer of A in K , this is defined as the unitary representation π λ of G  induced by the character of B = MAN given by the composition of the homomorphism of MAN onto A and the character λ. The induced representation is defined on functions f on G with       f   (   g  b   )    =   Δ    (  b  )    1  /  2    λ   (  b  )   f   (  g  )          f    g  b      normal-Δ   superscript  b    1  2    λ  b  f  g     f(gb)=\Delta(b)^{1/2}\lambda(b)f(g)     for b in B by        π   (  g  )   f   (  x  )    =   f   (    g   -  1    x   )     ,        π  g  f  x     f     superscript  g    1    x      \pi(g)f(x)=f(g^{-1}x),     where         ∥  f  ∥   2   =    ∫  K       |   f   (  k  )    |   2    d  k    <  ∞   .         superscript   norm  f   2     subscript   K      superscript      f  k    2   d  k             \|f\|^{2}=\int_{K}|f(k)|^{2}\,dk<\infty.     The functions f can be identified with functions in L 2 ( K / M ) and         χ  λ    (  g  )    =   (   π   (  g  )   1   ,  1  )    .         subscript  χ  λ   g      π  g  1   1     \chi_{\lambda}(g)=(\pi(g)1,1).     As  proved, the representations of the spherical principal series are irreducible and two representations π λ and π μ are unitarily equivalent if and only if μ = σ(λ) for some σ in the Weyl group of A .  Example: SL(2,C)  The group G = SL(2, C ) acts transitively on the quaternionic upper half space       ℌ  3   =   {   x  +   y  i   +   t  j   |  t  >   0    }        superscript  ℌ  3      x    y  i     t  j   ket  t   0       \mathfrak{H}^{3}=\{x+yi+tj|t>0\}     by Möbius transformations . The complex matrix      g  =   (     a    b      c    d     )       g    a  b    c  d      g=\begin{pmatrix}a&b\\
 c&d\end{pmatrix}     acts as        g   (  w  )    =    (    a  w   +  b   )     (    c  w   +  d   )    -  1      .        g  w         a  w   b    superscript      c  w   d     1       g(w)=(aw+b)(cw+d)^{-1}.     The stabiliser of the point j is the maximal compact subgroup K = SU(2), so that    ℌ  3     superscript  ℌ  3    \mathfrak{H}^{3}   = G / K . It carries the G -invariant Riemannian metric       d   s  2    =    r   -  2     (    d   x  2    +   d   y  2    +   d   r  2     )          d   superscript  s  2       superscript  r    2        d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2      d   superscript  r  2        ds^{2}=r^{-2}(dx^{2}+dy^{2}+dr^{2})     with associated volume element       d  V   =     r   -  3     d   x   d   y   d  r         d  V      superscript  r    3    d  x  d  y  d  r     dV=r^{-3}\,dx\,dy\,dr     and Laplacian operator       Δ  =    -    r  2    (    ∂  x  2   +   ∂  y  2   +   ∂  r  2    )     +   r   ∂  r      .      normal-Δ         superscript  r  2      superscript   subscript   x   2    superscript   subscript   y   2    superscript   subscript   r   2        r   subscript   r       \Delta=-r^{2}(\partial_{x}^{2}+\partial_{y}^{2}+\partial_{r}^{2})+r\partial_{r}.     Every point in    ℌ  3     superscript  ℌ  3    \mathfrak{H}^{3}   can be written as k ( e t j ) with k in SU(2) and t determined up to a sign. The Laplacian has the following form on functions invariant under SU(2), regarded as functions of the real parameter t :       Δ  =    -   ∂  t  2    -   2   coth  t    ∂  t      .      normal-Δ       superscript   subscript   t   2      2   hyperbolic-cotangent  t    subscript   t       \Delta=-\partial_{t}^{2}-2\coth t\partial_{t}.     The integral of an SU(2)-invariant function is given by        ∫    f   d  V    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  t  )     sinh  2     t   d  t       .          f  d  V      superscript   subscript            f  t    superscript   2     t  d  t        \int f\,dV=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)\,\sinh^{2}t\,dt.     Identifying the square integrable SU(2)-invariant functions with L 2 ( R ) by the unitary transformation Uf ( t ) = f ( t ) sinh t , Δ is transformed into the operator        U  *   Δ  U   =    -    d  2    d   t  2      +  1.          superscript  U    normal-Δ  U          superscript  d  2     d   superscript  t  2      1.     U^{*}\Delta U=-{d^{2}\over dt^{2}}+1.     By the Plancherel theorem and Fourier inversion formula for R , any SU(2)-invariant function f can be expressed in terms of the spherical functions         Φ  λ    (  t  )    =    sin   λ  t     λ   sinh  t      ,         subscript  normal-Φ  λ   t         λ  t      λ    t       \Phi_{\lambda}(t)={\sin\lambda t\over\lambda\sinh t},     by the spherical transform        f  ~    (  λ  )    =   ∫   f    Φ   -  λ     d  V           normal-~  f   λ       f   subscript  normal-Φ    λ    d  V      \tilde{f}(\lambda)=\int f\Phi_{-\lambda}\,dV     and the spherical inversion formula        f   (  x  )    =   ∫    f  ~    (  λ  )    Φ  λ    (  x  )     λ  2    d  λ     .        f  x        normal-~  f   λ   subscript  normal-Φ  λ   x   superscript  λ  2   d  λ      f(x)=\int\tilde{f}(\lambda)\Phi_{\lambda}(x)\lambda^{2}\,d\lambda.

For biinvariant functions this establishes the Plancherel theorem for spherical functions : the map      U  :    f  ↦   f  ~    ,     L  2    (    K  \  G   /  K   )    →    L  2    (  ℝ  ,     λ  2    d  λ   )         normal-:  U   formulae-sequence   maps-to  f   normal-~  f     normal-→     superscript  L  2      normal-\  K  G   K       superscript  L  2    ℝ     superscript  λ  2   d  λ         U:f\mapsto\tilde{f},\,\,L^{2}(K\backslash G/K)\rightarrow L^{2}({\mathbb{R}},%

The spherical function Φ λ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian:        Δ   Φ  λ    =    (    λ  2   +  1   )    Φ  λ     .        normal-Δ   subscript  normal-Φ  λ         superscript  λ  2   1    subscript  normal-Φ  λ      \displaystyle{\Delta\Phi_{\lambda}=(\lambda^{2}+1)\Phi_{\lambda}.}     Schwartz functions on R are the spherical transforms of functions f belonging to the Harish-Chandra Schwartz space       𝒮  =   {  f  |     sup  t    |     (   1  +   t  2    )   N     (   I  +  Δ   )   M   f   (  t  )    sinh   (  t  )     |    <  ∞   }    .

By the Paley-Wiener theorem , the spherical transforms of smooth SU(2)-invariant functions of compact support are precisely functions on R which are restrictions of holomorphic functions on C satisfying an exponential growth condition        |   F   (  λ  )    |   ≤   C   e   R  ⋅   |    Im   λ   |       .

As a function on G , Φ λ is the matrix coefficient of the spherical principal series defined on L 2 ( C ), where C is identified with the boundary of    ℌ  3     superscript  ℌ  3    \mathfrak{H}^{3}   . The representation is given by the formula         π  λ    (   g   -  1    )   ξ   (  z  )    =     |    c  z   +  d   |     -  2   -   i  λ     ξ   (   g   (  z  )    )     .         subscript  π  λ    superscript  g    1    ξ  z      superscript        c  z   d        2     i  λ     ξ    g  z      \pi_{\lambda}(g^{-1})\xi(z)=|cz+d|^{-2-i\lambda}\xi(g(z)).     The function        ξ  0    (  z  )    =    π   -  1      (   1  +    |  z  |   2    )    -  2            subscript  ξ  0   z      superscript  π    1     superscript    1   superscript    z   2      2       \xi_{0}(z)=\pi^{-1}(1+|z|^{2})^{-2}     is fixed by SU(2) and         Φ  λ    (  g  )    =   (    π  λ    (  g  )    ξ  0    ,   ξ  0   )    .         subscript  normal-Φ  λ   g       subscript  π  λ   g   subscript  ξ  0     subscript  ξ  0      \Phi_{\lambda}(g)=(\pi_{\lambda}(g)\xi_{0},\xi_{0}).

Every point in    ℌ  2     superscript  ℌ  2    \mathfrak{H}^{2}   can be written as k ( e t  i ) with k in SO(2) and t determined up to a sign. The Laplacian has the following form on functions invariant under SO(2), regarded as functions of the real parameter t :       Δ  =    -   ∂  t  2    -    coth  t    ∂  t      .      normal-Δ       superscript   subscript   t   2       hyperbolic-cotangent  t    subscript   t       \Delta=-\partial_{t}^{2}-\coth t\partial_{t}.     The integral of an SO(2)-invariant function is given by        ∫    f   d  A    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    f   (  t  )    |   sinh  t   |   d  t     .          f  d  A      superscript   subscript            f  t      t    d  t      \int f\,dA=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(t)\,|\sinh t|\,dt.     There are several methods for deriving the corresponding eigenfunction expansion for this ordinary differential equation including:   the classical spectral theory of ordinary differential equations applied to the hypergeometric equation (Mehler, Weyl, Fock);  variants of Hadamard's method of descent, realising 2-dimensional hyperbolic space as the quotient of 3-dimensional hyperbolic space by the free action of a 1-parameter subgroup of SL(2, C );  Abel's integral equation, following Selberg and Godement;  orbital integrals (Harish-Chandra, Gelfand & Naimark).   The second and third technique will be described below, with two different methods of descent: the classical one due Hadamard, familiar from treatments of the heat equation 12 and the wave equation 13 on hyperbolic space; and Flensted-Jensen's method on the hyperboloid.

Both these results can be deduced by descent from the corresponding results for SL(2, C ), 15 by verifying directly that the spherical transform satisfies the given growth conditions 16 17 and then using the relation      (    M  1  *   F   )   ∼   =   F  ~        superscript     superscript   subscript  M  1     F   similar-to    normal-~  F     {(M_{1}^{*}F)}^{\sim}=\tilde{F}   .

The symmetric space SL(2, C )/SU(2) can be identified with the space H 3 of positive 2×2 matrices A with determinant 1      A  =   (      a  +  b      x  +   i  y         x  -   i  y       a  -  b      )       A      a  b     x    i  y        x    i  y      a  b       A=\begin{pmatrix}a+b&x+iy\\

Similarly the action of SO(2) acts by rotation on the coordinates ( b , x ) leaving a and y unchanged. The space H 2 of real-valued positive matrices A with y = 0 can be identified with the orbit of the identity matrix under SL(2, R ). Taking coordinates ( b , x , y ) in H 3 and ( b , x ) on H 2 the volume and area elements are given by         d  V   =      (   1  +   r  2    )    -   1  /  2      d   b   d   x   d  y    ,    d  A   =      (   1  +   r  2    )    -   1  /  2      d   b   d  x     ,     formulae-sequence      d  V      superscript    1   superscript  r  2        1  2     d  b  d  x  d  y        d  A      superscript    1   superscript  r  2        1  2     d  b  d  x      dV=(1+r^{2})^{-1/2}\,db\,dx\,dy,\,\,\,dA=(1+r^{2})^{-1/2}\,db\,dx,     where r 2 equals b 2 + x 2 + y 2 or b 2 + x 2 , so that r is related to hyperbolic distance from the origin by    r  =   sinh  t       r    t     r=\sinh t   .  The Laplacian operators are given by the formula        Δ  n   =    -   L  n    -   R  n  2   -    (   n  -  1   )    R  n      ,       subscript  normal-Δ  n        subscript  L  n     superscript   subscript  R  n   2       n  1    subscript  R  n       \Delta_{n}=-L_{n}-R_{n}^{2}-(n-1)R_{n},\,     where        L  2   =    ∂  b  2   +   ∂  x  2     ,    R  2   =    b   ∂  b    +   x   ∂  x         formulae-sequence     subscript  L  2      superscript   subscript   b   2    superscript   subscript   x   2        subscript  R  2       b   subscript   b      x   subscript   x        L_{2}=\partial_{b}^{2}+\partial_{x}^{2},\,\,\,R_{2}=b\partial_{b}+x\partial_{x}     and         L  3   =    ∂  b  2   +   ∂  x  2   +   ∂  y  2     ,    R  3   =    b   ∂  b    +   x   ∂  x    +   y   ∂  y       .     formulae-sequence     subscript  L  3      superscript   subscript   b   2    superscript   subscript   x   2    superscript   subscript   y   2        subscript  R  3       b   subscript   b      x   subscript   x      y   subscript   y        L_{3}=\partial_{b}^{2}+\partial_{x}^{2}+\partial_{y}^{2},\,\,\,R_{3}=b\partial%

On the other hand         ∂  t  2   +    (    coth  t   +   tanh  t    )    ∂  t     =    ∂  t  2   +   2   coth   (   2  t   )     ∂  t      .         superscript   subscript   t   2        hyperbolic-cotangent  t     t     subscript   t        superscript   subscript   t   2     2   hyperbolic-cotangent    2  t     subscript   t       \partial_{t}^{2}+(\coth t+\tanh t)\partial_{t}=\partial_{t}^{2}+2\coth(2t)%
 \partial_{t}.     Thus, setting Sf ( t ) = f (2 t ),         (    Δ  2   -   R  2    )   S  f   =   4  S   Δ  2   f    ,           subscript  normal-Δ  2    subscript  R  2    S  f     4  S   subscript  normal-Δ  2   f     \displaystyle{(\Delta_{2}-R_{2})Sf=4S\Delta_{2}f},     leading to the fundamental descent relation of Flensted-Jensen for M 0 = ES :         Δ  3    M  0   f   =   4   M  0    Δ  2   f    .         subscript  normal-Δ  3    subscript  M  0   f     4   subscript  M  0    subscript  normal-Δ  2   f     \displaystyle{\Delta_{3}M_{0}f=4M_{0}\Delta_{2}f.}     The same relation holds with M 0 by M , where Mf is obtained by averaging M 0 f over SU(2).  The extension Ef is constant in the y variable and therefore invariant under the transformations g s . On the other hand for F a suitable function on H 3 , the function QF defined by       Q  F   =    ∫   K  1      F  ∘    g  s     d  s          Q  F     subscript    subscript  K  1        F   subscript  g  s    d  s      QF=\int_{K_{1}}F\circ g_{s}\,ds     is independent of the y variable. A straightforward change of variables shows that         ∫   H  3      F   d  V    =    ∫   H  2       (   1  +   b  2   +   x  2    )    1  /  2    Q   F   d  A     .        subscript    superscript  H  3      F  d  V      subscript    superscript  H  2       superscript    1   superscript  b  2    superscript  x  2      1  2    Q  F  d  A      \int_{H^{3}}F\,dV=\int_{H^{2}}(1+b^{2}+x^{2})^{1/2}QF\,dA.     Since K 1 commutes with SO(2), QF is SO(2)--invariant if F is, in particular if F is SU(2)-invariant. In this case QF is a function of r or t , so that M * F can be defined by         M  *   F   (  t  )    =   Q  F   (   t  /  2   )     .         superscript  M    F  t     Q  F    t  2      M^{*}F(t)=QF(t/2).     The integral formula above then yields        ∫   H  3      F   d  V    =    ∫   H  2      M  *    F   d  A          subscript    superscript  H  3      F  d  V      subscript    superscript  H  2       superscript  M    F  d  A      \int_{H^{3}}F\,dV=\int_{H^{2}}M^{*}F\,dA     and hence, since for f SO(2)-invariant,         M  *    (    (   M  f   )   ⋅  F   )    =   f  ⋅   (    M  *   F   )     ,         superscript  M     normal-⋅    M  f   F     normal-⋅  f     superscript  M    F      M^{*}((Mf)\cdot F)=f\cdot(M^{*}F),     the following adjoint formula:         ∫   H  3       (   M  f   )   ⋅   F    d  V    =    ∫   H  2      f  ⋅   (   M  *  F   )    d  V     .        subscript    superscript  H  3       normal-⋅    M  f   F   d  V      subscript    superscript  H  2       normal-⋅  f    M  F    d  V      \int_{H^{3}}(Mf)\cdot F\,dV=\int_{H^{2}}f\cdot(M*F)\,dV.     As a consequence         M  *    Δ  3    =   4   Δ  2    M  *     .         superscript  M     subscript  normal-Δ  3      4   subscript  normal-Δ  2    superscript  M       M^{*}\Delta_{3}=4\Delta_{2}M^{*}.     Thus, as in the case of Hadamard's method of descent.        M  *    Φ   2  λ     =   b   (  λ  )    φ  λ           superscript  M     subscript  normal-Φ    2  λ       b  λ   subscript  φ  λ      M^{*}\Phi_{2\lambda}=b(\lambda)\varphi_{\lambda}     with       b   (  λ  )    =    M  *    Φ   2  λ     (  0  )    =   π   tanh   π  λ             b  λ      superscript  M     subscript  normal-Φ    2  λ    0          π      π  λ        \displaystyle{b(\lambda)=M^{*}\Phi_{2\lambda}(0)=\pi\tanh\pi\lambda}     and        Φ   2  λ    =   M   φ  λ     .       subscript  normal-Φ    2  λ      M   subscript  φ  λ      \Phi_{2\lambda}=M\varphi_{\lambda}.     It follows that          (    M  *   F   )   ∼    (  λ  )    =    F  ~    (   2  λ   )     .         superscript     superscript  M    F   similar-to   λ      normal-~  F     2  λ      {(M^{*}F)}^{\sim}(\lambda)=\tilde{F}(2\lambda).     Taking f = M * F , the SL(2, C ) inversion formula for F then immediately yields        f   (  x  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     φ  λ    (  x  )    f  ~    (  λ  )     λ  π   2    tanh   (    π  λ   2   )    d  λ     ,        f  x     superscript   subscript             subscript  φ  λ   x   normal-~  f   λ      λ  π   2         π  λ   2    d  λ      f(x)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\varphi_{\lambda}(x)\tilde{f}(\lambda)\,{\lambda%

Combining this with the above inversion formula for f 1 yields the general spherical inversion formula:        f   (  w  )    =    1   π  2      ∫  0  ∞     f  ~    (  λ  )    φ  λ    (  w  )     λ  π   2    tanh   (    π  λ   2   )    d  λ      .        f  w       1   superscript  π  2      superscript   subscript   0        normal-~  f   λ   subscript  φ  λ   w      λ  π   2         π  λ   2    d  λ       f(w)={1\over\pi^{2}}\int_{0}^{\infty}\tilde{f}(\lambda)\varphi_{\lambda}(w){%

Other special cases  All complex semisimple Lie groups or the Lorentz groups SO 0 ( N ,1) with N odd can be treated directly by reduction to the usual Fourier transform. 20 21 The remaining real Lorentz groups can be deduced by Flensted-Jensen's method of descent, as can other semisimple Lie groups of real rank one. 22 Flensted-Jensen's method of descent also applies to the treatment of real semisimple Lie groups for which the Lie algebras are normal real forms of complex semisimple Lie algebras. 23 The special case of SL(N, R ) is treated in detail in ; this group is also the normal real form of SL(N, C ).  The approach of  applies to a wide class of real semisimple Lie groups of arbitrary real rank and yields the explicit product form of the Plancherel measure on   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   * without using Harish-Chandra's expansion of the spherical functions φ λ in terms of his c-function, discussed below. Although less general, it gives a simpler approach to the Plancherel theorem for this class of groups.  Complex semisimple Lie groups  If G is a complex semisimple Lie group, it is the complexification of its maximal compact subgroup U , a compact semisimple Lie group. If   𝔤   𝔤   {\mathfrak{g}}   and   𝔲   𝔲   \mathfrak{u}   are their Lie algebras, then       𝔤  =   𝔲  ⊕   i  𝔲     .      𝔤   direct-sum  𝔲    i  𝔲      \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{u}\oplus i\mathfrak{u}.     Let T be a maximal torus in U with Lie algebra   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   . Then setting        A  =   exp   i  𝔱     ,   P  =   exp   i  𝔲      ,     formulae-sequence    A      i  𝔱       P      i  𝔲       A=\exp i\mathfrak{t},\,\,P=\exp i\mathfrak{u},     there is the Cartan decomposition :       G  =   P  ⋅  U   =   U  A  U    .        G   normal-⋅  P  U          U  A  U      G=P\cdot U=UAU.     The finite-dimensional irreducible representations π λ of U are indexed by certain λ in    𝔱  *     superscript  𝔱     \mathfrak{t}^{*}   . 24 The corresponding character formula and dimension formula of Hermann Weyl give explicit formulas for       χ  λ    (   e  X   )   =   Tr    π  λ    (   e  X   )   ,   (  X  ∈  𝔱  )   )  ,  d  (  λ  )  =   dim   π    λ   .     fragments   subscript  χ  λ    fragments  normal-(   superscript  e  X   normal-)    Tr   subscript  π  λ    fragments  normal-(   superscript  e  X   normal-)   normal-,   fragments  normal-(  X   t  normal-)   normal-)  normal-,  d  normal-(  λ  normal-)   dim  π   λ   normal-.    \chi_{\lambda}(e^{X})={\rm Tr}\,\pi_{\lambda}(e^{X}),(X\in\mathfrak{t})),\,\,%
 \,d(\lambda)={\rm dim}\,\pi_{\lambda}.     These formulas, initially defined on     𝔱  *   ×  𝔱       superscript  𝔱    𝔱    \mathfrak{t}^{*}\times\mathfrak{t}   and    𝔱  *     superscript  𝔱     \mathfrak{t}^{*}   , extend holomorphic to their complexifications. Moreover         χ  λ    (   e  X   )    =     ∑   σ  ∈  W     sign   (  σ  )    e   i  λ   (   σ  X   )        δ   (   e  X   )      ,         subscript  χ  λ    superscript  e  X        subscript     σ  W      sign  σ   superscript  e    i  λ    σ  X         δ   superscript  e  X       \chi_{\lambda}(e^{X})={\sum_{\sigma\in W}{\rm sign}(\sigma)e^{i\lambda(\sigma X%
 )}\over\delta(e^{X})},     where W is the Weyl group     W  =     N  U    (  T  )    /  T       W       subscript  N  U   T   T     W=N_{U}(T)/T   and δ( e X ) is given by a product formula (Weyl's denominator formula) which extends holomorphically to the complexification of   𝔱   𝔱   \mathfrak{t}   . There is a similar product formula for d (λ), a polynomial in λ.  On the complex group G , the integral of a U -biinvariant function F can be evaluated as         ∫  G    F   (  g  )   d  g    =    1   |  W  |      ∫  𝔞    F   (   e  X   )      |   δ   (   e  X   )    |   2    d  X      .        subscript   G     F  g  d  g        1    W      subscript   𝔞     F   superscript  e  X    superscript      δ   superscript  e  X     2   d  X       \int_{G}F(g)\,dg={1\over|W|}\int_{\mathfrak{a}}F(e^{X})\,|\delta(e^{X})|^{2}\,dX.     where    𝔞  =   i  𝔱       𝔞    i  𝔱     \mathfrak{a}=i\mathfrak{t}   .  The spherical functions of G are labelled by λ in    𝔞  =   i   𝔱  *        𝔞    i   superscript  𝔱       \mathfrak{a}=i\mathfrak{t}^{*}   and given by the Harish-Chandra-Berezin formula 25         Φ  λ    (   e  X   )    =     χ  λ    (   e  X   )     d   (  λ  )      .         subscript  normal-Φ  λ    superscript  e  X         subscript  χ  λ    superscript  e  X      d  λ      \Phi_{\lambda}(e^{X})={\chi_{\lambda}(e^{X})\over d(\lambda)}.     They are the matrix coefficients of the irreducible spherical principal series of G induced from the character of the Borel subgroup of G corresponding to λ; these representations are irreducible and can all be realized on L 2 ( U / T ).  The spherical transform of a U -biinvariant function F is given by        F  ~    (  λ  )    =    ∫  G    F   (  g  )    Φ   -  λ     (  g  )   d  g           normal-~  F   λ     subscript   G     F  g   subscript  normal-Φ    λ    g  d  g      \tilde{F}(\lambda)=\int_{G}F(g)\Phi_{-\lambda}(g)\,dg     and the spherical inversion formula by        F   (  g  )    =    1   |  W  |      ∫   𝔞  *      F  ~    (  λ  )    Φ  λ    (  g  )      |   d   (  λ  )    |   2     d   λ     =    ∫   𝔞  +  *      F  ~    (  λ  )    Φ  λ    (  g  )      |   d   (  λ  )    |   2     d   λ     ,          F  g       1    W      subscript    superscript  𝔞        normal-~  F   λ   subscript  normal-Φ  λ   g   superscript      d  λ    2   d  λ            subscript    subscript   superscript  𝔞          normal-~  F   λ   subscript  normal-Φ  λ   g   superscript      d  λ    2   d  λ       F(g)={1\over|W|}\int_{{\mathfrak{a}}^{*}}\tilde{F}(\lambda)\Phi_{\lambda}(g)|d%

In fact the result follows from the Fourier inversion formula on   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   since 26        d   (  λ  )   δ   (   e  X   )    Φ  λ    (   e  X   )    =    ∑   σ  ∈  W     sign   (  σ  )    e   i  λ   (  X  )        ,        d  λ  δ   superscript  e  X    subscript  normal-Φ  λ    superscript  e  X      subscript     σ  W      sign  σ   superscript  e    i  λ  X        d(\lambda)\delta(e^{X})\Phi_{\lambda}(e^{X})=\sum_{\sigma\in W}{\rm sign}(%
 \sigma)e^{i\lambda(X)},     so that      d   (  λ  )    ¯    F  ~    (  λ  )        normal-¯    d  λ     normal-~  F   λ    \displaystyle\overline{d(\lambda)}\tilde{F}(\lambda)   is just the Fourier transform of    F   (   e  X   )   δ   (   e  X   )       F   superscript  e  X   δ   superscript  e  X     \displaystyle F(e^{X})\delta(e^{X})   .  Note that the symmetric space  G / U has as compact dual 27 the compact symmetric space U x U / U , where U is the diagonal subgroup. The spherical functions for the latter space, which can be identified with U itself, are the normalized characters χ λ / d (λ) indexed by lattice points in the interior of    𝔞  +  *     subscript   superscript  𝔞       {\mathfrak{a}}^{*}_{+}   and the role of A is played by T . The spherical transform of f of a class function on U is given by        f  ~    (  λ  )    =    ∫  U    f   (  u  )        χ  λ    (  u  )    ¯    d   (  λ  )      d  u           normal-~  f   λ     subscript   U     f  u     normal-¯     subscript  χ  λ   u      d  λ    d  u      \tilde{f}(\lambda)=\int_{U}f(u){\overline{\chi_{\lambda}(u)}\over d(\lambda)}%
 \,du     and the spherical inversion formula now follows from the theory of Fourier series on T :        f   (  u  )    =    ∑  λ     f  ~    (  λ  )      χ  λ    (  u  )     d   (  λ  )     d    (  λ  )   2      .        f  u     subscript   λ      normal-~  f   λ       subscript  χ  λ   u     d  λ    d   superscript  λ  2       f(u)=\sum_{\lambda}\tilde{f}(\lambda){\chi_{\lambda}(u)\over d(\lambda)}d(%

There is an evident duality between these formulas and those for the non-compact dual. 28  Real semisimple Lie groups  Let G 0 be a normal real form of the complex semisimple Lie group G , the fixed points of an involution σ, conjugate linear on the Lie algebra of G . Let τ be a Cartan involution of G 0 extended to an involution of G , complex linear on its Lie algebra, chosen to commute with σ. The fixed point subgroup of τσ is a compact real form U of G , intersecting G 0 in a maximal compact subgroup K 0 . The fixed point subgroup of τ is K , the complexification of K 0 . Let G 0 = K 0 · P 0 be the corresponding Cartan decomposition of G 0 and let A be a maximal Abelian subgroup of P 0 .  proved that       G  =   K   A  +   U    ,      G    K   subscript  A    U     \displaystyle G=KA_{+}U,     where A + is the image of the closure of a Weyl chamber in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   under the exponential map. Moreover         K  \  G   /  U   =   A  +    .         normal-\  K  G   U    subscript  A      K\backslash G/U=A_{+}.     Since         K  0   \   G  0    /   K  0    =   A  +          normal-\   subscript  K  0    subscript  G  0     subscript  K  0     subscript  A      K_{0}\backslash G_{0}/K_{0}=A_{+}     it follows that there is a canonical identification between K \ G / U , K 0 \ G 0 / K 0 and A + . Thus K 0 -biinvariant functions on G 0 can be identified with functions on A + as can functions on G that are left invariant under K and right invariant under U . Let f be a function in     C  c  ∞    (     K  0   \   G  0    /   K  0    )        subscript   superscript  C    c      normal-\   subscript  K  0    subscript  G  0     subscript  K  0      C^{\infty}_{c}(K_{0}\backslash G_{0}/K_{0})   and define Mf in     C  c  ∞    (    U  \  G   /  U   )        subscript   superscript  C    c      normal-\  U  G   U     C^{\infty}_{c}(U\backslash G/U)   by        M  f   (  a  )    =    ∫  U    f   (   u   a  2    )   d  u     .        M  f  a     subscript   U     f    u   superscript  a  2    d  u      \displaystyle Mf(a)=\int_{U}f(ua^{2})\,du.     Here a third Cartan decomposition of G = UAU has been used to identify U \ G / U with A + .  Let Δ be the Laplacian on G 0 / K 0 and let Δ c be the Laplacian on G / U . Then        4  M  Δ   =    Δ  c   M    .        4  M  normal-Δ      subscript  normal-Δ  c   M     \displaystyle 4M\Delta=\Delta_{c}M.     For F in     C  c  ∞    (    U  \  G   /  U   )        subscript   superscript  C    c      normal-\  U  G   U     C^{\infty}_{c}(U\backslash G/U)   , define M * F in     C  c  ∞    (     K  0   \   G  0    /   K  0    )        subscript   superscript  C    c      normal-\   subscript  K  0    subscript  G  0     subscript  K  0      C^{\infty}_{c}(K_{0}\backslash G_{0}/K_{0})   by         M  *   F   (   a  2   )    =    ∫  K    F   (   g  a   )   d  g     .         superscript  M    F   superscript  a  2      subscript   K     F    g  a   d  g      \displaystyle M^{*}F(a^{2})=\int_{K}F(ga)\,dg.     Then M and M * satisfy the duality relations         ∫   G  /  U      (   M  f   )   ⋅  F    =    ∫    G  0   /   K  0      f  ⋅   (    M  *   F   )      .        subscript     G  U     normal-⋅    M  f   F      subscript      subscript  G  0    subscript  K  0      normal-⋅  f     superscript  M    F       \displaystyle\int_{G/U}(Mf)\cdot F=\int_{G_{0}/K_{0}}f\cdot(M^{*}F).     In particular         M  *    Δ  c    =   4  Δ   M  *     .         superscript  M     subscript  normal-Δ  c      4  normal-Δ   superscript  M       \displaystyle M^{*}\Delta_{c}=4\Delta M^{*}.     There is a similar compatibility for other operators in the center of the universal enveloping algebra of G 0 . It follows from the eigenfunction characterisation of spherical functions that     M  *    Φ   2  λ         superscript  M     subscript  normal-Φ    2  λ      M^{*}\Phi_{2\lambda}   is proportional to φ λ on G 0 , the constant of proportionality being given by        b   (  λ  )    =    M  *    Φ   2  λ     (  1  )    =    ∫  K     Φ   2  λ     (  k  )   d  k     .          b  λ      superscript  M     subscript  normal-Φ    2  λ    1          subscript   K      subscript  normal-Φ    2  λ    k  d  k       b(\lambda)=M^{*}\Phi_{2\lambda}(1)=\int_{K}\Phi_{2\lambda}(k)\,dk.     Moreover in this case 29          (    M  *   F   )   ∼    (  λ  )    =    F  ~    (   2  λ   )     .         superscript     superscript  M    F   similar-to   λ      normal-~  F     2  λ      \displaystyle(M^{*}F)^{\sim}(\lambda)=\tilde{F}(2\lambda).     If f = M * F , then the spherical inversion formula for F on G implies that for f on G 0 : 30 31        f   (  g  )    =    ∫   𝔞  +  *        f  ~    (  λ  )    φ  λ    (  g  )    2    dim   A     ⋅   |   b   (  λ  )    |   ⋅     |   d   (   2  λ   )    |   2     d  λ     ,        f  g     subscript    subscript   superscript  𝔞          normal-⋅     normal-~  f   λ   subscript  φ  λ   g   superscript  2    dim  A         b  λ     superscript      d    2  λ     2    d  λ      f(g)=\int_{\mathfrak{a}^{*}_{+}}\tilde{f}(\lambda)\varphi_{\lambda}(g)\,\,2^{{%

The direct calculation of the integral for b (λ), generalising the computation of  for SL(2, R ), was left as an open problem by . 32 An explicit product formula for b (λ) was known from the prior determination of the Plancherel measure by , giving 33 34        b   (  λ  )    =     C  ⋅  d     (   2  λ   )    -  1     ⋅    ∏   α  >  0     tanh    π   (  α  ,  λ  )     (  α  ,  α  )        ,        b  λ    normal-⋅     normal-⋅  C  d    superscript    2  λ     1       subscript  product    α  0          π   α  λ     α  α         b(\lambda)=C\cdot d(2\lambda)^{-1}\cdot\prod_{\alpha>0}\tanh{\pi(\alpha,%

Let    𝔤  ±     subscript  𝔤  plus-or-minus    \mathfrak{g}_{\pm}   be the ±1 eigenspaces of σ in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , so that    𝔨  =   𝔤  +       𝔨   subscript  𝔤      \mathfrak{k}=\mathfrak{g}_{+}   is the Lie algebra of K and    𝔭  =   𝔤  -       𝔭   subscript  𝔤      \mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{g}_{-}   give the Cartan decomposition        𝔤  =   𝔨  +  𝔭    ,   G  =   exp   𝔭  ⋅  K      .     formulae-sequence    𝔤    𝔨  𝔭      G     normal-⋅  𝔭  K       \mathfrak{g}=\mathfrak{k}+\mathfrak{p},\,\,G=\exp\mathfrak{p}\cdot K.     Let   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   be a maximal Abelian subalgebra of   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   and for α in    𝔞  *     superscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}^{*}   let       𝔤  α   =   {  X  ∈  𝔤  :   [  H  ,  X  ]   =  α   (  H  )    X    (  H  ∈  𝔞  )   }   .     fragments   subscript  𝔤  α     fragments  normal-{  X   g  normal-:   fragments  normal-[  H  normal-,  X  normal-]    α   fragments  normal-(  H  normal-)   X   fragments  normal-(  H   a  normal-)   normal-}   normal-.    \mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}=\{X\in\mathfrak{g}:[H,X]=\alpha(H)X\,\,(H\in\mathfrak{a}%
 )\}.     If α ≠ 0 and     𝔤  α   ≠   (  0  )        subscript  𝔤  α   0    \mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}\neq(0)   , then α is called a restricted root and m α = dim    𝔤  α     subscript  𝔤  α    \mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}   is called its multiplicity . Let A = exp   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , so that G = KAK .The restriction of the Killing form defines an inner product on   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   and hence   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , which allows    𝔞  *     superscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}^{*}   to be identified with   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   . With respect to this inner product, the restricted roots Σ give a root system . Its Weyl group can be identified with    W  =      N  K    (  A  )    /   C  K     (  A  )        W         subscript  N  K   A    subscript  C  K    A     W=N_{K}(A)/C_{K}(A)   . A choice of positive roots defines a Weyl chamber    𝔞  +  *     superscript   subscript  𝔞       \mathfrak{a}_{+}^{*}   . The reduced root system Σ 0 consists of roots α such that α/2 is not a root.  Defining the spherical functions φ λ as above for λ in    𝔞  *     superscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}^{*}   , the spherical transform of f in C c ∞ ( K \ G / K ) is defined by         f  ~    (  λ  )    =    ∫  G    f   (  g  )    φ   -  λ     (  g  )   d  g     .         normal-~  f   λ     subscript   G     f  g   subscript  φ    λ    g  d  g      \tilde{f}(\lambda)=\int_{G}f(g)\varphi_{-\lambda}(g)\,dg.     The spherical inversion formula states that        f   (  g  )    =    ∫   𝔞  +  *      f  ~    (  λ  )    φ  λ    (  g  )      |   c   (  λ  )    |    -  2     d  λ     ,        f  g     subscript    subscript   superscript  𝔞          normal-~  f   λ   subscript  φ  λ   g   superscript      c  λ      2    d  λ      f(g)=\int_{\mathfrak{a}^{*}_{+}}\tilde{f}(\lambda)\varphi_{\lambda}(g)\,|c(%

The Plancherel theorem for spherical functions states that the map      W  :    f  ↦   f  ~    ,     L  2    (    K  \  G   /  K   )    →    L  2    (   𝔞  +  *   ,      |   c   (  λ  )    |    -  2     d  λ   )         normal-:  W   formulae-sequence   maps-to  f   normal-~  f     normal-→     superscript  L  2      normal-\  K  G   K       superscript  L  2     superscript   subscript  𝔞         superscript      c  λ      2    d  λ         W:f\mapsto\tilde{f},\,\,\,\ L^{2}(K\backslash G/K)\rightarrow L^{2}(\mathfrak{%
 a}_{+}^{*},|c(\lambda)|^{-2}\,d\lambda)     is unitary and transforms convolution by    f  ∈    L  1    (    K  \  G   /  K   )        f     superscript  L  1      normal-\  K  G   K      f\in L^{1}(K\backslash G/K)   into multiplication by    f  ~     normal-~  f    \tilde{f}   .  Harish-Chandra's spherical function expansion  Since G = KAK , functions on G / K that are invariant under K can be identified with functions on A , and hence   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , that are invariant under the Weyl group W . In particular since the Laplacian Δ on G / K commutes with the action of G , it defines a second order differential operator L on   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , invariant under W , called the radial part of the Laplacian . In general if X is in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , it defines a first order differential operator (or vector field) by        X  f   (  y  )    =      d   d  t    f   (   y  +   t  X    )    |    t  =  0     .        X  f  y    evaluated-at      d    d  t    f    y    t  X       t  0      Xf(y)={d\over dt}f(y+tX)|_{t=0}.     L can be expressed in terms of these operators by the formula 36       L  =    Δ  𝔞   -    ∑   α  >  0       m  α     coth    α    A  α         ,      L     subscript  normal-Δ  𝔞     subscript     α  0       subscript  m  α    hyperbolic-cotangent    α   subscript  A  α          \displaystyle L=\Delta_{\mathfrak{a}}-\sum_{\alpha>0}m_{\alpha}\,\coth\alpha\,%
 A_{\alpha},     where A α in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   is defined by       (   A  α   ,  X  )   =   α   (  X  )          subscript  A  α   X     α  X     \displaystyle(A_{\alpha},X)=\alpha(X)     and       Δ  𝔞   =   -   ∑   X  i  2          subscript  normal-Δ  𝔞        superscript   subscript  X  i   2       \Delta_{\mathfrak{a}}=-\sum X_{i}^{2}     is the Laplacian on   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , corresponding to any choice of orthonormal basis ( X i ).  Thus       L  =    L  0   -    ∑   α  >  0       m  α     (    coth  α   -  1   )    A  α       ,      L     subscript  L  0     subscript     α  0       subscript  m  α      hyperbolic-cotangent  α   1    subscript  A  α        L=L_{0}-\sum_{\alpha>0}m_{\alpha}\,(\coth\alpha-1)A_{\alpha},     where        L  0   =    Δ  𝔞   -    ∑   α  >  0     A  α      ,       subscript  L  0      subscript  normal-Δ  𝔞     subscript     α  0     subscript  A  α       L_{0}=\Delta_{\mathfrak{a}}-\sum_{\alpha>0}A_{\alpha},     so that L can be regarded as a perturbation of the constant-coefficient operator L 0 .  Now the spherical function φ λ is an eigenfunction of the Laplacian:       Δ   φ  λ    =    (     ∥  λ  ∥   2   +    ∥  ρ  ∥   2    )    φ  λ          normal-Δ   subscript  φ  λ         superscript   norm  λ   2    superscript   norm  ρ   2     subscript  φ  λ      \Delta\varphi_{\lambda}=(\|\lambda\|^{2}+\|\rho\|^{2})\varphi_{\lambda}     and therefore of L , when viewed as a W -invariant function on   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   .  Since e i λ–ρ and its transforms under W are eigenfunctions of L 0 with the same eigenvalue, it is natural look for a formula for φ λ in terms of a perturbation series        f  λ   =    e    i  λ   -  ρ      ∑   μ  ∈  Λ      a  μ    (  λ  )    e   -  μ        ,       subscript  f  λ      superscript  e      i  λ   ρ      subscript     μ  normal-Λ       subscript  a  μ   λ   superscript  e    μ         f_{\lambda}=e^{i\lambda-\rho}\sum_{\mu\in\Lambda}a_{\mu}(\lambda)e^{-\mu},     with Λ the cone of all non-negative integer combinations of positive roots, and the transforms of f λ under W . The expansion         coth  x   -  1   =   2    ∑   m  >  0     e   -   2  m  x        ,         hyperbolic-cotangent  x   1     2    subscript     m  0     superscript  e      2  m  x         \displaystyle\coth x-1=2\sum_{m>0}e^{-2mx},     leads to a recursive formula for the coefficients a μ (λ). In particular they are uniquely determined and the series and its derivatives converges absolutely on    𝔞  +     subscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}_{+}   , a fundamental domain for W . Remarkably it turns out that f λ is also an eigenfunction of the other G -invariant differential operators on G / K , each of which induces a W -invariant differential operator on   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   .  It follows that φ λ can be expressed in terms as a linear combination of f λ and its transforms under W : 37        φ  λ   =    ∑   s  ∈  W     c   (   s  λ   )    f   s  λ       .       subscript  φ  λ     subscript     s  W      c    s  λ    subscript  f    s  λ        \varphi_{\lambda}=\sum_{s\in W}c(s\lambda)f_{s\lambda}.     Here c (λ) is Harish-Chandra's c-function . It describes the asymptotic behaviour of φ λ in    𝔞  +     subscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}_{+}   , since 38        φ  λ    (    e  t   X   )    ∼   c   (  λ  )    e    (    i  λ   -  ρ   )   X  t        similar-to     subscript  φ  λ      superscript  e  t   X      c  λ   superscript  e        i  λ   ρ   X  t       \varphi_{\lambda}(e^{t}X)\sim c(\lambda)e^{(i\lambda-\rho)Xt}     for X in    𝔞  +     subscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}_{+}   and t >0 large.  Harish-Chandra obtained a second integral formula for φ λ and hence c (λ) using the Bruhat decomposition of G : 39       G  =    ⋃   s  ∈  W     B  s  B     ,      G    subscript     s  W      B  s  B      G=\bigcup_{s\in W}BsB,     where B = MAN and the union is disjoint. Taking the Coxeter element  s 0 of W , the unique element mapping    𝔞  +     subscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}_{+}   onto    -   𝔞  +        subscript  𝔞      -\mathfrak{a}_{+}   , it follows that σ( N ) has a dense open orbit G / B = K / M whose complement is a union of cells of strictly smaller dimension and therefore has measure zero. It follows that the integral formula for φ λ initially defined over K / M         φ  λ    (  g  )    =    ∫   K  /  M      λ  ′      (   g  k   )    -  1     d  k     .         subscript  φ  λ   g     subscript     K  M       superscript  λ  normal-′    superscript    g  k     1    d  k      \varphi_{\lambda}(g)=\int_{K/M}\lambda^{\prime}(gk)^{-1}\,dk.     can be transferred to σ( N ): 40         φ  λ    (   e  X   )    =    e    i  λ   -  ρ      ∫   σ   (  N  )           λ  ′    (  n  )    ¯     λ  ′    (    e  X   n   e   -  X     )      d  n      ,         subscript  φ  λ    superscript  e  X       superscript  e      i  λ   ρ      subscript     σ  N         normal-¯     superscript  λ  normal-′   n       superscript  λ  normal-′      superscript  e  X   n   superscript  e    X       d  n       \varphi_{\lambda}(e^{X})=e^{i\lambda-\rho}\int_{\sigma(N)}{\overline{\lambda^{%
 \prime}(n)}\over\lambda^{\prime}(e^{X}ne^{-X})}\,dn,     for X in   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   .  Since        lim   t  →  ∞      e   t  X    n   e   -   t  X       =  1        subscript    normal-→  t        superscript  e    t  X    n   superscript  e      t  X       1    \lim_{t\rightarrow\infty}e^{tX}ne^{-tX}=1     for X in    𝔞  +     subscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}_{+}   , the asymptotic behaviour of φ λ can be read off from this integral, leading to the formula: 41        c   (  λ  )    =    ∫   σ   (  N  )          λ  ′    (  n  )    ¯    d  n     .        c  λ     subscript     σ  N       normal-¯     superscript  λ  normal-′   n    d  n      c(\lambda)=\int_{\sigma(N)}\overline{\lambda^{\prime}(n)}\,dn.     Harish-Chandra's c-function  The many roles of Harish-Chandra's c -function in non-commutative harmonic analysis are surveyed in . Although it was originally introduced by Harish-Chandra in the asymptotic expansions of spherical functions, discussed above, it was also soon understood to be intimately related to intertwining operators between induced representations, first studied in this context by . These operators exhibit the unitary equivalence between π λ and π s λ for s in the Weyl group and a c -function c s (λ) can be attached to each such operator: namely the value at 1 of the intertwining operator applied to ξ 0 , the constant function 1, in L 2 ( K / M ). 42 Equivalently, since ξ 0 is up to scalar multiplication the unique vector fixed by K , it is an eigenvector of the intertwining operator with eigenvalue c s (λ). These operators all act on the same space L 2 ( K / M ), which can be identified with the representation induced from the 1-dimensional representation defined by λ on MAN . Once A has been chosen, the compact subgroup M is uniquely determined as the centraliser of A in K . The nilpotent subgroup N , however, depends on a choice of a Weyl chamber in    𝔞  *     superscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}^{*}   , the various choices being permuted by the Weyl group W = M ' / M , where M ' is the normaliser of A in K . The standard intertwining operator corresponding to ( s , λ) is defined on the induced representation by 43        A   (  s  ,  λ  )   F   (  k  )    =    ∫    σ   (  N  )    ∩    s   -  1    N  s      F   (   k  s  n   )   d  n     ,        A   s  λ   F  k     subscript       σ  N      superscript  s    1    N  s       F    k  s  n   d  n      \displaystyle A(s,\lambda)F(k)=\int_{\sigma(N)\cap s^{-1}Ns}F(ksn)\,dn,     where σ is the Cartan involution. It satisfies the intertwining relation        A   (  s  ,  λ  )    π  λ    (  g  )    =    π   s  λ     (  g  )   A   (  s  ,  λ  )     .        A   s  λ    subscript  π  λ   g      subscript  π    s  λ    g  A   s  λ      \displaystyle A(s,\lambda)\pi_{\lambda}(g)=\pi_{s\lambda}(g)A(s,\lambda).     The key property of the intertwining operators and their integrals is the multiplicative cocycle property 44        A   (    s  1    s  2    ,  λ  )    =   A   (   s  1   ,    s  2   λ   )   A   (   s  2   ,  λ  )     ,        A      subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2    λ      A    subscript  s  1      subscript  s  2   λ    A    subscript  s  2   λ      \displaystyle A(s_{1}s_{2},\lambda)=A(s_{1},s_{2}\lambda)A(s_{2},\lambda),     whenever       ℓ   (    s  1    s  2    )    =    ℓ   (   s  1   )    +   ℓ   (   s  2   )           normal-ℓ     subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2         normal-ℓ   subscript  s  1      normal-ℓ   subscript  s  2       \ell(s_{1}s_{2})=\ell(s_{1})+\ell(s_{2})     for the length function on the Weyl group associated with the choice of Weyl chamber. For s in W , this is the number of chambers crossed by the straight line segment between X and sX for any point X in the interior of the chamber. The unique element of greatest length s 0 , namely the number of positive restricted roots, is the unique element that carries the Weyl chamber    𝔞  +  *     superscript   subscript  𝔞       \mathfrak{a}_{+}^{*}   onto    -   𝔞  +  *        superscript   subscript  𝔞        -\mathfrak{a}_{+}^{*}   . By Harish-Chandra's integral formula, it corresponds to Harish-Chandra's c -function:        c   (  λ  )    =    c   s  0     (  λ  )     .        c  λ      subscript  c   subscript  s  0    λ     c(\lambda)=c_{s_{0}}(\lambda).     The c -functions are in general defined by the equation        A   (  s  ,  λ  )    ξ  0    =    c  s    (  λ  )    ξ  0     ,        A   s  λ    subscript  ξ  0       subscript  c  s   λ   subscript  ξ  0      \displaystyle A(s,\lambda)\xi_{0}=c_{s}(\lambda)\xi_{0},     where ξ 0 is the constant function 1 in L 2 ( K / M ). The cocycle property of the intertwining operators implies a similar multiplicative property for the c -functions:        c    s  1    s  2      (  λ  )    =    c   s  1     (    s  2   λ   )    c   s  2     (  λ  )           subscript  c     subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2     λ      subscript  c   subscript  s  1       subscript  s  2   λ    subscript  c   subscript  s  2    λ     c_{s_{1}s_{2}}(\lambda)=c_{s_{1}}(s_{2}\lambda)c_{s_{2}}(\lambda)     provided        ℓ   (    s  1    s  2    )    =    ℓ   (   s  1   )    +   ℓ   (   s  2   )      .        normal-ℓ     subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2         normal-ℓ   subscript  s  1      normal-ℓ   subscript  s  2       \ell(s_{1}s_{2})=\ell(s_{1})+\ell(s_{2}).     This reduces the computation of c s to the case when s = s α , the reflection in a (simple) root α, the so-called "rank-one reduction" of . In fact the integral involves only the closed connected subgroup G α corresponding to the Lie subalgebra generated by    𝔤   ±  α      subscript  𝔤   plus-or-minus  α     \mathfrak{g}_{\pm\alpha}   where α lies in Σ 0 + . 45 Then G α is a real semisimple Lie group with real rank one, i.e. dim A α = 1, and c s is just the Harish-Chandra c -function of G α . In this case the c -function can be computed directly by various means:   by noting that φ λ can be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function for which the asymptotic expansion is known from the classical formulas of Gauss for the connection coefficients ; 46 47    by directly computing the integral, which can be expressed as an integral in two variables and hence a product of two beta functions . 48 49   This yields the following formula:         c   s  α     (  λ  )    =    c  0      2   -   i   (  λ  ,   α  0   )      Γ   (   i   (  λ  ,   α  0   )    )     Γ   (   1  2    (   1  2    m  α   +  1  +  i   (  λ  ,   α  0   )   )   Γ   (   1  2    (   1  2    m  α   +   m   2  α    +  i   (  λ  ,   α  0   )   )         ,         subscript  c   subscript  s  α    λ      subscript  c  0        superscript  2      i   λ   subscript  α  0       normal-Γ    i   λ   subscript  α  0       fragments  Γ   fragments  normal-(    1  2    fragments  normal-(    1  2    subscript  m  α    1   i   fragments  normal-(  λ  normal-,   subscript  α  0   normal-)   normal-)   Γ   fragments  normal-(    1  2    fragments  normal-(    1  2    subscript  m  α     subscript  m    2  α     i   fragments  normal-(  λ  normal-,   subscript  α  0   normal-)   normal-)          c_{s_{\alpha}}(\lambda)=c_{0}{2^{-i(\lambda,\alpha_{0})}\Gamma(i(\lambda,%
 \alpha_{0}))\over\Gamma({1\over 2}({1\over 2}m_{\alpha}+1+i(\lambda,\alpha_{0}%
 ))\Gamma({1\over 2}({1\over 2}m_{\alpha}+m_{2\alpha}+i(\lambda,\alpha_{0}))},     where        c  0   =    2     m  α   /  2   +   m   2  α      Γ   (    1  2    (    m  α   +   m   2  α    +  1   )    )     .       subscript  c  0      superscript  2       subscript  m  α   2    subscript  m    2  α      normal-Γ      1  2      subscript  m  α    subscript  m    2  α    1       c_{0}=2^{m_{\alpha}/2+m_{2\alpha}}\Gamma({1\over 2}(m_{\alpha}+m_{2\alpha}+1)).     The general Gindikin–Karpelevich formula for c (λ) is an immediate consequence of this formula and the multiplicative properties of c s (λ).  Paley–Wiener theorem  The Paley-Wiener theorem generalizes the classical Paley-Wiener theorem by characterizing the spherical transforms of smooth K -bivariant functions of compact support on G . It is a necessary and sufficient condition that the spherical transform be W -invariant and that there is an R > 0 such that for each N there is an estimate        |    f  ~    (  λ  )    |   ≤    C  N     (   1  +   |  λ  |    )    -  N     e   R   |    Im   λ   |       .           normal-~  f   λ       subscript  C  N    superscript    1    λ      N     superscript  e    R      Im  λ         |\tilde{f}(\lambda)|\leq C_{N}(1+|\lambda|)^{-N}e^{R|{\rm Im}\,\lambda|}.     In this case f is supported in the closed ball of radius R about the origin in G / K .  This was proved by Helgason and Gangolli ( pg. 37).  The theorem was later proved by  independently of the spherical inversion theorem, using a modification of his method of reduction to the complex case. 50  Rosenberg's proof of inversion formula  noticed that the Paley-Wiener theorem and the spherical inversion theorem could be proved simultaneously, by a trick which considerably simplified previous proofs.  The first step of his proof consists in showing directly that the inverse transform, defined using Harish-Chandra's c -function, defines a function supported in the closed ball of radius R about the origin if the Paley-Wiener estimate is satisfied. This follows because the integrand defining the inverse transform extends to a meromorphic function on the complexification of    𝔞  *     superscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}^{*}   ; the integral can be shifted to     𝔞  *   +   i  μ  t        superscript  𝔞      i  μ  t     \mathfrak{a}^{*}+i\mu t   for μ in    𝔞  +  *     subscript   superscript  𝔞       \mathfrak{a}^{*}_{+}   and t > 0. Using Harish-Chandra's expansion of φ λ and the formulas for c (λ) in terms of Gamma functions , the integral can be bounded for t large and hence can be shown to vanish outside the closed ball of radius R about the origin. 51  This part of the Paley-Wiener theorem shows that       T   (  f  )    =    ∫   𝔞  +  *      f  ~    (  λ  )      |   c   (  λ  )    |    -  2     d  λ          T  f     subscript    superscript   subscript  𝔞          normal-~  f   λ   superscript      c  λ      2    d  λ      \displaystyle T(f)=\int_{\mathfrak{a}_{+}^{*}}\tilde{f}(\lambda)|c(\lambda)|^{%
 -2}\,d\lambda     defines a distribution on G / K with support at the origin o . A further estimate for the integral shows that it is in fact given by a measure and that therefore there is a constant C such that        T   (  f  )    =   C  f   (  o  )     .        T  f     C  f  o     \displaystyle T(f)=Cf(o).     By applying this result to         f  1    (  g  )    =    ∫  K    f   (    x   -  1    k  g   )   d  k     ,         subscript  f  1   g     subscript   K     f     superscript  x    1    k  g   d  k      f_{1}(g)=\int_{K}f(x^{-1}kg)\,dk,     it follows that        C  f   =    ∫   𝔞  +  *      f  ~    (  λ  )    φ  λ      |   c   (  λ  )    |    -  2     d  λ     .

 {-2}\,d\lambda.     A further scaling argument allows the inequality C = 1 to be deduced from the Plancherel theorem and Paley-Wiener theorem on   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   . 52 53  Schwartz functions  The Harish-Chandra Schwartz space can be defined as 54        𝒮   (    K  \  G   /  K   )    =   {   f  ∈    C  ∞     (   G  /  K   )   K     :     sup  x    |     (   1  +   d   (  x  ,  o  )     )   m     (   Δ  +  I   )   n   f   (  x  )    |    <  ∞   }    .

 }(\Delta+I)^{n}f(x)|<\infty\}.     Under the spherical transform it is mapped onto    𝒮    (   𝔞  *   )   W       𝒮   superscript   superscript  𝔞    W     \mathcal{S}(\mathfrak{a}^{*})^{W}   , the space of W -invariant Schwartz functions on    𝔞  *     superscript  𝔞     \mathfrak{a}^{*}   .  The original proof of Harish-Chandra was a long argument by induction. 55 56 57 found a short and simple proof, allowing the result to be deduced directly from versions of the Paley-Wiener and spherical inversion formula. He proved that the spherical transform of a Harish-Chandra Schwartz function is a classical Schwartz function. His key observation was then to show that the inverse transform was continuous on the Paley-Wiener space endowed with classical Schwartz space seminorms , using classical estimates.
