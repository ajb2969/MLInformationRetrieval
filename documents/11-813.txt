   1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase      1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a 1-acylglycerol-3-phosphate O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate , whereas its two products are CoA and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:1-acyl-sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 2-O-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include 1-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate acyltransferase , 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase , 1-acylglycero-3-phosphate acyltransferase , 1-acylglycerolphosphate acyltransferase , 1-acylglycerophosphate acyltransferase , and lysophosphatidic acid-acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : glycerolipid metabolism , glycerophospholipid metabolism , and ether lipid metabolism .
