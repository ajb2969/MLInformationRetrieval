   Kingman's formula      Kingman's formula   In queueing theory , a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability , Kingman's formula is an approximation for the mean waiting time in a G/G/1 queue . 1 The formula is the product of three terms which depend on utilization, variability and service time. It was first published by John Kingman in his 1961 paper The single server queue in heavy traffic . 2 It is known to be generally very accurate, especially for a system operating close to saturation. 3  Statement of formula  Kingman's approximation states       𝔼   (   W  q   )    ≈    (   ρ   1  -  ρ    )    (     c  a  2   +   c  s  2    2   )   τ         𝔼   subscript  W  q        ρ    1  ρ         superscript   subscript  c  a   2    superscript   subscript  c  s   2    2   τ     \mathbb{E}(W_{q})\approx\left(\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}\right)\left(\frac{c_{a}^{2}+%
 c_{s}^{2}}{2}\right)\tau   where τ is the mean service time (i.e. μ = 1/ τ is the service rate), λ is the mean arrival rate, ρ = λ / μ is the utilization, c a is the coefficient of variation for arrivals (that is the standard deviation of arrival times divided by the mean arrival time) and c s is the coefficient of variation for service times.
