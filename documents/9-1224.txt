Publicly Verifiable Secret Sharing

In cryptography, a secret sharing scheme is publicly verifiable (PVSS) if it is a verifiable secret sharing scheme and if any party involved can verify the validity of the shares distributed by the dealer. 
The method introduced here according to the paper by Chunming Tang, Dingyi Pei, Zhuo Liu, and Yong He is non-interactive and maintains this property throughout the protocol.
Initialization
The PVSS scheme dictates an initialization process in which:

All system parameters are generated.
Each participant must have a registered public key.

Excluding the initialization process, the PVSS consists of two phases:
Distribution
1.Distribution of secret 
 
 
 
  shares is performed by the dealer 
 
 
 
 , which does the following:

The dealer creates 
 
 
 
  for each participant 
 
 
 
 
  respectively.
The dealer publishes the encrypted share 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
 .
The dealer also publishes a string 
 
 
 
  to show that each 
 
 
 
  encrypts 
 
 


(note
 
 
 
  guarantees that the reconstruction protocol will result in the same 
 
 
 
 .
2. Verification of the shares:

Anybody knowing the public keys for the encryption methods 
 
 
 
 , can verify the shares.
If one or more verifications fails the dealer fails and the protocol is aborted.

Reconstruction
1. Decryption of the shares:

The Participants 
 
 
 
  decrypts their share of the secret 
 
 
 
 
  using 
 
 
 
 .

(note: fault-tolerance can be allowed here: it's not required that all participants succeed in decrypting 
 
 
 
  as long as a qualified set of participants are successful to decrypt 
 
 
 
 ).

The participant release 
 
 
 
  plus a string 
 
 
 
 
  this shows the released share is correct.

2. Pooling the shares:

Using the strings 
 
 
 
  to exclude the participants which are dishonest or failed to decrypt 
 
 
 
 .
Reconstruction 
 
 
 
  can be done from the shares of any qualified set of participants.

Chaums and Pedersen Scheme
A proposed protocol proving
 
 
 
  :

The prover chooses a random 
 
 

The verifier send a random challenge 
 
 

The prover responds with 
 
 

The verifier checks 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 


Denote this protocol as
 
 

 A generalization of 
 
 
 
  is denoted as
 
 
 
  where as
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :

The prover chooses a random 
 
 
 
 
  and sends 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

The verifier send a random challenge 
 
 
 
 .
The prover responds with 
 
 
 
  , 
 
 
 
 
 .
The verifier checks 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 


The Chaums and Pedersen method is an interactive method and needs some modification to be used in a non-interactive way: Replacing the randomly chosen 
 
 
 
  by a 'secure hash' function with 
 
 
 
  as input value.
