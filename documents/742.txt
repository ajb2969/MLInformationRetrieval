   Homotopy group with coefficients      Homotopy group with coefficients   In topology, a branch of mathematics, for    i  ≥  2      i  2    i\geq 2   , the i -th homotopy group with coefficients in an abelian group G of a based space X is the pointed set of homotopy classes of based maps from the Moore space of type    (  G  ,  i  )     G  i    (G,i)   to X , and is denoted by     π  i    (  X  ;  G  )        subscript  π  i    X  G     \pi_{i}(X;G)   . 1 For    i  ≥  3      i  3    i\geq 3   ,     π  i    (  X  ;  G  )        subscript  π  i    X  G     \pi_{i}(X;G)   is a group. Note     π  i    (  X  ;  ℤ  )        subscript  π  i    X  ℤ     \pi_{i}(X;\mathbb{Z})   are the usual homotopy groups of X .  References   C.
