L-olivosyl-oleandolide 3-O-methyltransferase

L-olivosyl-oleandolide 3-O-methyltransferase (, OleY) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:L-olivosyl-oleandolide B 3-O-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + L-olivosyl-oleandolide 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + L-oleandrosyl-oleandolide
 

The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the macrolide antibiotic oleandomycin in Streptomyces antibioticus.
