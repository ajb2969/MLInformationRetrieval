In geometry , the bicorn , also known as a cocked hat curve due to its resemblance to a bicorne , is a rational  quartic curve defined by the equation         y  2    (    a  2   -   x  2    )    =    (     x  2   +   2  a  y    -   a  2    )   2    .         superscript  y  2      superscript  a  2    superscript  x  2      superscript       superscript  x  2     2  a  y     superscript  a  2    2     y^{2}(a^{2}-x^{2})=(x^{2}+2ay-a^{2})^{2}.   It has two cusps and is symmetric about the y-axis.  History  In 1864, James Joseph Sylvester studied the curve          y  4   -   x   y  3    -   8  x   y  2     +   36   x  2   y   +   16   x  2     -   27   x  3     =  0             superscript  y  4     x   superscript  y  3      8  x   superscript  y  2       36   superscript  x  2   y     16   superscript  x  2       27   superscript  x  3     0    y^{4}-xy^{3}-8xy^{2}+36x^{2}y+16x^{2}-27x^{3}=0   in connection with the classification of quintic equations ; he named the curve a bicorn because it has two cusps. This curve was further studied by Arthur Cayley in 1867.  Properties  The bicorn is a plane algebraic curve of degree four and genus zero. It has two cusp singularities in the real plane, and a double point in the complex projective plane at x=0, z=0 . If we move x=0 and z=0 to the origin substituting and perform an imaginary rotation on x bu substituting ix/z for x and 1/z for y in the bicorn curve, we obtain         (     x  2   -   2  a  z    +    a  2    z  2     )   2   =    x  2   +    a  2    z  2      .       superscript       superscript  x  2     2  a  z       superscript  a  2    superscript  z  2     2      superscript  x  2      superscript  a  2    superscript  z  2       (x^{2}-2az+a^{2}z^{2})^{2}=x^{2}+a^{2}z^{2}.\,   This curve, a limaçon , has an ordinary double point at the origin, and two nodes in the complex plane, at x = ± i and z=1.  The parametric equations of a bicorn curve are:      x  =   a   sin   (  θ  )         x    a    θ      x=a\sin(\theta)   and    y  =      cos  2    (  θ  )     (   2  +   cos   (  θ  )     )     3  +    sin  2    (  θ  )          y        superscript   2   θ     2    θ       3    superscript   2   θ       y=\frac{\cos^{2}(\theta)\left(2+\cos(\theta)\right)}{3+\sin^{2}(\theta)}   with     -  π   ≤  θ  ≤  π          π   θ       π     -\pi\leq\theta\leq\pi     See also   List of curves   References    "Bicorn" at The MacTutor History of Mathematics archive   "Bicorne" at Encyclopédie des Formes Mathématiques Remarquables  The Collected Mathematical Papers of James Joseph Sylvester.
