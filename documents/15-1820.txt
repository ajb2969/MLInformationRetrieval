   Supermetric      Supermetric   Supersymmetry gauge theory including supergravity is mainly developed as a Yang - Mills type theory with spontaneous breakdown of supersymmetries. There are various superextensions of pseudo-orthogonal Lie algebras and the Poincaré Lie algebra . The nonlinear realization of some Lie superalgebras have been studied. However, supergravity introduced in SUSY gauge theory has no geometric feature as a supermetric.  In gauge theory on a principal bundle     P  →  M     normal-→  P  M    P\to M   with a structure group   K   K   K   , spontaneous symmetry breaking is characterized as a reduction of   K   K   K   to some closed subgroup   H   H   H   . By the well-known theorem, such a reduction takes place if and only if there exists a global section   h   h   h   of the quotient bundle     P  /  H   →  M     normal-→    P  H   M    P/H\to M   . This section is treated as a classical Higgs field .  In particular, this is the case of gauge gravitation theory where    P  =   F  M       P    F  M     P=FM   is a principal frame bundle of linear frames in the tangent bundle     T  M      T  M    TM   of a world manifold    M   M   M   . In accordance with the geometric equivalence principle , its structure group    G  L   (  n  ,  ℝ  )       G  L   n  ℝ     GL(n,\mathbb{R})   is reduced to the Lorentz group     O   (  1  ,  3  )       O   1  3     O(1,3)   , and the associated global section of the quotient bundle      F  M   /  O    (  1  ,  3  )           F  M   O    1  3     FM/O(1,3)   is a pseudo-Riemannian metric on   M   M   M   , i.e., a gravitational field in General Relativity .  Similarly, a supermetric can be defined as a global section of a certain quotient superbundle.  It should be emphasized that there are different notions of a supermanifold . Lie supergroups and principal superbundles are considered in the category of   G   G   G   -supermanifolds. Let     P  ^   →   M  ^      normal-→   normal-^  P    normal-^  M     \widehat{P}\to\widehat{M}   be a principal superbundle with a structure Lie supergroup    K  ^     normal-^  K    \widehat{K}   , and let    H  ^     normal-^  H    \widehat{H}   be a closed Lie supersubgroup of    K  ^     normal-^  K    \widehat{K}   such that     K  ^   →    K  ^   /   H  ^       normal-→   normal-^  K      normal-^  K    normal-^  H      \widehat{K}\to\widehat{K}/\widehat{H}   is a principal superbundle. There is one-to-one correspondence between the principal supersubbundles of    P  ^     normal-^  P    \widehat{P}   with the structure Lie supergroup    H  ^     normal-^  H    \widehat{H}   and the global sections of the quotient superbundle      P  ^   /   H  ^    →   M  ^      normal-→     normal-^  P    normal-^  H     normal-^  M     \widehat{P}/\widehat{H}\to\widehat{M}   with a typical fiber     K  ^   /   H  ^        normal-^  K    normal-^  H     \widehat{K}/\widehat{H}   .  A key point is that underlying spaces of   G   G   G   -supermanifolds are smooth real manifolds , but possessing very particular transition functions. Therefore, the condition of local triviality of the quotient     K  ^   →    K  ^   /   H  ^       normal-→   normal-^  K      normal-^  K    normal-^  H      \widehat{K}\to\widehat{K}/\widehat{H}   is rather restrictive. It is satisfied in the most interesting case for applications when    K  ^     normal-^  K    \widehat{K}   is a supermatrix group and    H  ^     normal-^  H    \widehat{H}   is its Cartan supersubgroup. For instance, let     P  ^   =   F   M  ^         normal-^  P     F   normal-^  M      \widehat{P}=F\widehat{M}   be a principal superbundle of graded frames in the tangent superspaces over a supermanifold    M  ^     normal-^  M    \widehat{M}   of even-odd dimensione    (  n  ,   2  m   )     n    2  m     (n,2m)   . If its structure general linear supergroup     K  ^   =    G  L   ^    (  n  |  2  m  ;  Λ  )      fragments   normal-^  K     normal-^    G  L     fragments  normal-(  n  normal-|  2  m  normal-;  Λ  normal-)     \widehat{K}=\widehat{GL}(n|2m;\Lambda)   is reduced to the orthogonal-symplectic supersubgroup     H  ^   =    O  S   ^   p   (  n  |  m  ;  Λ  )      fragments   normal-^  H     normal-^    O  S    p   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-|  m  normal-;  Λ  normal-)     \widehat{H}=\widehat{OS}p(n|m;\Lambda)   , one can think of the corresponding global section of the quotient superbundle      F   M  ^    /   H  ^    →   M  ^      normal-→      F   normal-^  M     normal-^  H     normal-^  M     F\widehat{M}/\widehat{H}\to\widehat{M}   as being a supermetric on a supermanifold    M  ^     normal-^  M    \widehat{M}   .  In particular, this is the case of a super-Euclidean metric on a superspace     B   n  |  2  m      superscript  B   fragments  n  normal-|  2  m     B^{n|2m}   .
