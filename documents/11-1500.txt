   Glucuronokinase      Glucuronokinase   In enzymology , a glucuronokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + D-glucuronate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 1-phospho-alpha-D-glucuronate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-glucuronate , whereas its two products are ADP and 1-phospho-alpha-D-glucuronate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-glucuronate 1-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include glucuronokinase (phosphorylating) , and glucurono-glucuronokinase . This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
