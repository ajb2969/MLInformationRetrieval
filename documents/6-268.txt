‡Second column of table indicates solubility at each given temperature in volume of CO2 as it would be measured at 101.3 kPa and 0 °C per volume of water. 
The solubility is given for "pure water", i.e., water which contain only CO2. This water is going to be acidic. For example, at 25 °C the pH of 3.9 is expected (see carbonic acid). At less acidic pH values, the solubility will increase because of the pH-dependent speciation of CO2.

Table data obtained from CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics 44th ed. Annotation "(s)" indicates equilibrium temperature of vapor over solid. Otherwise temperature is equilibrium of vapor over liquid. For kPa values, where datum is whole numbers of atmospheres exact kPa values are given, elsewhere 2 significant figures derived from mm Hg data.

Liquid/vapor equilibrium thermodynamic data
The table below gives thermodynamic data of liquid CO2 in equilibrium with its vapor at various temperatures. Heat content data, heat of vaporization, and entropy values are relative to the liquid state at 0 °C temperature and 3483 kPa pressure. To convert heat values to joules per mole values, multiply by 44.095 grams/mole. To convert densities to moles/liter, multiply by 22.678 cm3-mole/liter-gram. Data obtained from CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 44th ed. pages 2560-2561, except for critical temperature line (31.1 °C) and temperatures –30 °C and below, which are taken from Lange's Handbook of Chemistry, 10th ed. page 1463.

Because nitrogen and oxygen are symmetrical and carbon dioxide and water vapor are not, the air in an infrared spectrophotometer may show absorbances for CO2 and water. This is easily overcome by subtracting a blank spectrum from the experimental spectrum, and instruments are often purged with dry nitrogen as well.↩
