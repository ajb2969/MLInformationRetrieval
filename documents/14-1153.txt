   Reflection principle (Wiener process)      Reflection principle (Wiener process)   (Figure)  Wiener process and its reflection upon reaching a crossing point|Simulation of Wiener process (black curve). When the process reaches the crossing point at a =50 at t    ≈     \approx   3000, both the original process and its reflection (red curve) about the a =50 line (blue line) are shown. After the crossing point, both black and red curves have the same distribution.   In the theory of probability for stochastic processes , the reflection principle for a Wiener process states that if the path of a Wiener process f ( t ) reaches a value f ( s ) = a at time t = s , then the subsequent path after time s has the same distribution as the reflection of the subsequent path about the value a . 1 More formally, the reflection principle refers to a lemma concerning the distribution of the supremum of the Wiener process, or Brownian motion. The result relates the distribution of the supremum of Brownian motion up to time t to the distribution of the process at time t . It is a corollary of the strong Markov property of Brownian motion.  Statement  If    (    W   (  t  )    :   t  ≥  0    )     normal-:    W  t     t  0     (W(t):t\geq 0)   is a Wiener process, and    a  >  0      a  0    a>0   is a threshold (also called a crossing point), then the lemma states:      ℙ   (   sup   0  ≤  s  ≤  t    W   (  s  )   ≥  a  )   =  2  ℙ   (  W   (  t  )   ≥  a  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  supremum      0  s       t     W   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)    a  normal-)    2  P   fragments  normal-(  W   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    a  normal-)     \mathbb{P}\left(\sup_{0\leq s\leq t}W(s)\geq a\right)=2\mathbb{P}(W(t)\geq a)     In a stronger form, the reflection principle says that if   τ   τ   \tau   is a stopping time then the reflection of the Wiener process starting at   τ   τ   \tau   , denoted    (     W  τ    (  t  )    :   t  ≥  0    )     normal-:     superscript  W  τ   t     t  0     (W^{\tau}(t):t\geq 0)   , is also a Wiener process, where:        W  τ    (  t  )   =  W   (  t  )    χ  {   t  ≤  τ  }   +   (  2  W   (  τ  )   -  W   (  t  )   )    χ  {   t  >  τ  }     fragments   fragments   superscript  W  τ    fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    W   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    subscript  χ  normal-{   t   τ  normal-}     fragments  normal-(  2  W   fragments  normal-(  τ  normal-)    W   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-)    subscript  χ  normal-{   t   τ  normal-}    W^{\tau}(t)=W(t)\chi_{\left\{}t\leq\tau\right\}+(2W(\tau)-W(t))\chi_{\left\{}t%
 >\tau\right\}     The stronger form implies the original lemma by choosing    τ  =   inf   {   t  ≥  0   :    W   (  t  )    =  a   }        τ   infimum   conditional-set    t  0       W  t   a       \tau=\inf\left\{t\geq 0:W(t)=a\right\}   .  Proof  The earliest stopping time for reaching crossing point a ,     τ  a   :=   inf   {  t  :    W   (  t  )    =  a   }       assign   subscript  τ  a    infimum   conditional-set  t      W  t   a       \tau_{a}:=\inf\left\{t:W(t)=a\right\}   , is an almost surely bounded stopping time. Then we can apply the strong Markov property to deduce that a relative path subsequent to    τ  a     subscript  τ  a    \tau_{a}   , given by     X  t   :=    W   (   t  +   τ  a    )    -  a      assign   subscript  X  t       W    t   subscript  τ  a     a     X_{t}:=W(t+\tau_{a})-a   , is also simple Brownian motion independent of    ℱ   τ  a   W     subscript   superscript  ℱ  W    subscript  τ  a     \mathcal{F}^{W}_{\tau_{a}}   . Then the probability distribution for the last time    W   (  s  )       W  s    W(s)   is at or above the threshold   a   a   a   in the time interval    [  0  ,  t  ]     0  t    [0,t]   can be decomposed as      ℙ   (   sup   0  ≤  s  ≤  t    W   (  s  )   ≥  a  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  supremum      0  s       t     W   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)    a  normal-)     \displaystyle\mathbb{P}(\sup_{0\leq s\leq t}W(s)\geq a)   . By the tower property for conditional expectations , the second term reduces to:      ℙ   (   sup   0  ≤  s  ≤  t    W   (  s  )   ≥  a  ,  X   (  t  -   τ  a   )   <  0  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   subscript  supremum      0  s       t     W   fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)    a  normal-,  X   fragments  normal-(  t    subscript  τ  a   normal-)    0  normal-)     \displaystyle\mathbb{P}(\sup_{0\leq s\leq t}W(s)\geq a,X(t-\tau_{a})<0)   since    X   (  t  )       X  t    X(t)   is a standard Brownian motion independent of    ℱ   τ  a   W     subscript   superscript  ℱ  W    subscript  τ  a     \mathcal{F}^{W}_{\tau_{a}}   and has probability    1  /  2      1  2    1/2   of being less than   0   0    . The proof of the lemma is completed by substituting this into the first equation. 2  Consequences  The reflection principle is often used to simplify distributional properties of Brownian motion. Considering Brownian motion on the restricted interval    (    W   (  t  )    :   t  ∈   [  0  ,  1  ]     )     normal-:    W  t     t   0  1      (W(t):t\in[0,1])   then the reflection principle allows us to prove that the location of the maxima    t  max     subscript  t  max    t_{\text{max}}   , satisfying     W   (   t  max   )    =    sup   0  ≤  s  ≤  1     W   (  s  )           W   subscript  t  max      subscript  supremum      0  s       1       W  s      W(t_{\text{max}})=\sup_{0\leq s\leq 1}W(s)   , has the arcsine distribution . This is one of the Lévy arcsine laws . 3  References  "  Category:Articles created via the Article Wizard  Category:Stochastic calculus     ↩  Mörters, P.; Peres,Y. (2010) Brownian Motion , CUP.
