Schröder's equation

Schröder's equation,123 named after Ernst Schröder, is a functional equation with one independent variable: given the function 
 
 
 
 , find the function 
 
 
 
  such that:  Schröder's equation is an eigenvalue equation for the composition operator , which sends a function 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a fixed point of 
 
 
 
 , meaning 
 
 
 
 , then either 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
 ) or 
 
 
 
 =1. Thus, provided 
 
 
 
  is finite and 
 
 
 
  does not vanish or diverge, the eigenvalue

 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 .
Functional significance
For

  is analytic on the unit disk, fixes 0, and 0 $h ′(0)$| $Ψ$ satisfying Schröder's equation. This is one of the first steps in a long line of theorems fruitful for understanding composition operators on analytic function spaces, cf. Koenigs function.
Equations such as Schröder's are suitable to encoding self-similarity, and have thus been extensively utilized in studies of nonlinear dynamics (often referred to colloquially as chaos theory). It is also used in studies of turbulence, as well as the renormalization group.45
An equivalent transpose form of Schröder's equation for the inverse Ψ−1}} of Schröder's conjugacy function is 
 
 
 
 . The change of variables 
 
 
 
  (the Abel function) further converts Schröder's equation to the older Abel equation, 
 
 
 
 . Similarly, the change of variables 
 
 
 
  converts Schröder's equation to Böttcher's equation, (φ(x))s}}.
Moreover, for the velocity,6

 
 ,   Julia's equation,   
 
 
 
 , holds.
The n-th power of a solution of Schröder's equation provides a solution of Schröder's equation with eigenvalue , instead. In the same vein, for an invertible solution 
 
 
 
  of Schröder's equation, the (non-invertible) function 
 
 
 
  is also a solution, for any periodic function 
 
 
 
  with period 
 
 
 
 . All solutions of Schröder's equation are related in this manner.
Solutions
Schröder's equation was solved analytically if 
 
 
 
  is an attracting (but not superattracting) fixed point, that is 0 $h (a) )$| 7
In the case of a superattracting fixed point, |
 
 
 
 | = 0, Schröder's equation is unwieldy, and had best be transformed to Böttcher's equation.8
There are a good number of particular solutions dating back to Schröder's original 1870 paper.9
The series expansion around a fixed point and the relevant convergence properties of the solution for the resulting orbit and its analyticity properties are cogently summarized by Szekeres.10 Several of the solutions are furnished in terms of asymptotic series, cf. Carleman matrix.
Applications
It is used to analyse discrete dynamical systems by finding a new coordinate system in which the system (orbit) generated by h(x) looks simpler, a mere dilation.
More specifically, a system for which a discrete unit time step amounts to 
 
 
 
 , can have its smooth orbit (or flow) reconstructed from the solution of the above Schröder's equation, its [[Topological conjugacy|conjugacy
equation]].
That is,    Ψ−1(s Ψ(x)) ≡ h1(x)}}.
In general, all of its functional iterates (its regular iteration group, cf. iterated function) are provided by the orbit  for 
 
 
 
  real — not necessarily positive or integer. (Thus a full continuous group.) The set of , i.e., of all positive integer iterates of 
 
 
 
  (semigroup) is called the splinter (or Picard sequence) of 
 
 
 
 .
However, all iterates (fractional, infinitesimal, or negative) of 
 
 
 
  are likewise specified through the coordinate transformation 
 
 
 
  determined to solve Schröder's equation: a holographic continuous interpolation of the initial discrete recursion 
 
 
 
  has been constructed;11 in effect, the entire orbit.
For instance, the functional square root is  Ψ−1 (s½ Ψ(x) )}}, so that  h (x)}}, and so on.

For example,12 special cases of the logistic map such as the chaotic case 
 
 
 
  were already worked out by Schröder in his original paper13 (cf. p. 306),

In fact, this solution is seen to result as motion dictated by a sequence of switchback potentials,14 , a generic feature of continuous iterates effected by Schröder's equation.
A nonchaotic case he also illustrated with his method, 
 
 
 
 , yields
