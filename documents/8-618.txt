   Schr√∂der's equation      Schr√∂der's equation   Schr√∂der's equation , 1 2 3 named after Ernst Schr√∂der , is a functional equation with one independent variable: given the function    h   (  x  )       h  x    h(x)   , find the function    Œ®   (  x  )       normal-Œ®  x    Œ®(x)   such that:  Schr√∂der's equation is an eigenvalue equation for the composition operator  , which sends a function    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   to    f   (   h   (  x  )    )       f    h  x     f(h(x))   .  If   a   a   a   is a fixed point of    h   (  x  )       h  x    h(x)   , meaning     h   (  a  )    =  a        h  a   a    h(a)=a   , then either     Œ®   (  a  )    =  0        normal-Œ®  a   0    Œ®(a)=0   (or   ‚àû   normal-‚àû   ‚àû   ) or   s   s   s   =1. Thus, provided    Œ®   (  a  )       normal-Œ®  a    Œ®(a)   is finite and    (  ùêö  )    ùêö   \mathbf{(a)}   does not vanish or diverge, the eigenvalue    s   s   s   is given by    s  =   h   (  a  )        s    h  a     s=h(a)   .  Functional significance  For    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   , if   h   h   h   is analytic on the unit disk, fixes 0, and 0¬†$h ‚Ä≤(0)$|¬†$Œ®$ satisfying Schr√∂der's equation. This is one of the first steps in a long line of theorems fruitful for understanding composition operators on analytic function spaces, cf. Koenigs function .  Equations such as Schr√∂der's are suitable to encoding self-similarity , and have thus been extensively utilized in studies of nonlinear dynamics (often referred to colloquially as chaos theory ). It is also used in studies of turbulence , as well as the renormalization group . 4 5  An equivalent transpose form of Schr√∂der's equation for the inverse Œ® ‚àí1 }} of Schr√∂der's conjugacy function is     h   (   Œ¶   (  y  )    )    =   Œ¶   (   s  y   )          h    normal-Œ¶  y      normal-Œ¶    s  y      h(Œ¶(y))=Œ¶(sy)   . The change of variables     Œ±   (  x  )    =     l  o  g   (   Œ®   (  x  )    )    /  l   o  g   (  s  )          Œ±  x         l  o  g    normal-Œ®  x    l   o  g  s     Œ±(x)=log(Œ®(x))/log(s)   (the Abel function ) further converts Schr√∂der's equation to the older Abel equation ,     Œ±   (   h   (  x  )    )    =    Œ±   (  x  )    +  1         Œ±    h  x        Œ±  x   1     Œ±(h(x))=Œ±(x)+1   . Similarly, the change of variables     Œ®   (  x  )    =   l  o  g   (   œÜ   (  x  )    )          normal-Œ®  x     l  o  g    œÜ  x      Œ®(x)=log(œÜ(x))   converts Schr√∂der's equation to B√∂ttcher's equation , ( œÜ ( x )) s }} .  Moreover, for the velocity, 6      Œ≤   (  x  )    =   Œ®  /  Œ®         Œ≤  x     normal-Œ®  normal-Œ®     Œ≤(x)=Œ®/Œ®   , Julia 's equation ,     Œ≤   (   f   (  x  )    )    =   f   (  x  )   Œ≤   (  x  )          Œ≤    f  x      f  x  Œ≤  x     Œ≤(f(x))=f(x)Œ≤(x)   , holds.  The n -th power of a solution of Schr√∂der's equation provides a solution of Schr√∂der's equation with eigenvalue , instead. In the same vein, for an invertible solution    Œ®   (  x  )       normal-Œ®  x    Œ®(x)   of Schr√∂der's equation, the (non-invertible) function    Œ®   (  x  )   k   (   l  o  g  Œ®   (  x  )    )       normal-Œ®  x  k    l  o  g  normal-Œ®  x     Œ®(x)k(logŒ®(x))   is also a solution, for any periodic function    k   (  x  )       k  x    k(x)   with period    l  o  g   (  s  )       l  o  g  s    log(s)   . All solutions of Schr√∂der's equation are related in this manner.  Solutions  Schr√∂der's equation was solved analytically if   a   a   a   is an attracting (but not superattracting) fixed point, that is 0 $h (a) )$| 7  In the case of a superattracting fixed point, |    h   (  a  )   )     fragments  h   fragments  normal-(  a  normal-)   normal-)    h(a))   | = 0, Schr√∂der's equation is unwieldy, and had best be transformed to B√∂ttcher's equation . 8  There are a good number of particular solutions dating back to Schr√∂der's original 1870 paper. 9  The series expansion around a fixed point and the relevant convergence properties of the solution for the resulting orbit and its analyticity properties are cogently summarized by Szekeres . 10 Several of the solutions are furnished in terms of asymptotic series , cf. Carleman matrix .  Applications  It is used to analyse discrete dynamical systems by finding a new coordinate system in which the system (orbit) generated by h ( x ) looks simpler, a mere dilation.  More specifically, a system for which a discrete unit time step amounts to    x  ‚Üí  h   (  x  )       x  normal-‚Üí  h  x    x‚Üíh(x)   , can have its smooth orbit (or flow ) reconstructed from the solution of the above Schr√∂der's equation, its [[Topological conjugacy|conjugacy  equation]].  That is,  Œ® ‚àí1 ( s  Œ® ( x )) ‚â° h 1 ( x )}} .  In general, all of its functional iterates (its regular iteration group , cf. iterated function ) are provided by the orbit for   t   t   t   real ‚Äî not necessarily positive or integer. (Thus a full continuous group .) The set of , i.e., of all positive integer iterates of    h   (  x  )       h  x    h(x)   ( semigroup ) is called the splinter (or Picard sequence) of    h   (  x  )       h  x    h(x)   .  However, all iterates (fractional, infinitesimal, or negative) of    h   (  x  )       h  x    h(x)   are likewise specified through the coordinate transformation    Œ®   (  x  )       normal-Œ®  x    Œ®(x)   determined to solve Schr√∂der's equation: a holographic continuous interpolation of the initial discrete recursion    x  ‚Üí  h   (  x  )       x  normal-‚Üí  h  x    x‚Üíh(x)   has been constructed; 11 in effect, the entire orbit .  For instance, the functional square root is  Œ® ‚àí1 ( s ¬Ω  Œ® ( x ) )}} , so that  h ( x )}} , and so on.

Chaos is evident in the orbit sweeping all   x   x   x   s at all times.]]  For example, 12 special cases of the logistic map such as the chaotic case     h   (  x  )    =   4  x   (   1  ‚àí  x   )          h  x     4  x    1  normal-‚àí  x      h(x)=4x(1‚àíx)   were already worked out by Schr√∂der in his original paper 13 (cf. p.¬†306),        Œ®   (  x  )    =   a  r  c  s  i  n  ¬≤   (   ‚àö  x   )          normal-Œ®  x     a  r  c  s  i  n  normal-¬≤    normal-‚àö  x      Œ®(x)=arcsin¬≤(‚àöx)   ,    s  =  4      s  4    s=4   , and hence sin¬≤(2 t arcsin(‚àö x ))}} .   In fact, this solution is seen to result as motion dictated by a sequence of switchback potentials, 14  , a generic feature of continuous iterates effected by Schr√∂der's equation.  A nonchaotic case he also illustrated with his method,     h   (  x  )    =   2  x   (   1  ‚àí  x   )          h  x     2  x    1  normal-‚àí  x      h(x)=2x(1‚àíx)   , yields        Œ®   (  x  )    =   ‚àí  ¬Ω  l  n   (   1  ‚àí  2  x   )          normal-Œ®  x     normal-‚àí  normal-¬Ω  l  n    1  normal-‚àí  2  x      Œ®(x)=‚àí¬Ωln(1‚àí2x)   , and hence ‚àí¬Ω((1‚àí2 x ) 2 t ‚àí1)}} .   Likewise, for the Beverton‚ÄìHolt model ,     h   (  x  )    =   x  /   (   2  ‚àí  x   )          h  x     x    2  normal-‚àí  x      h(x)=x/(2‚àíx)   , one readily finds 15      Œ®   (  x  )    =   x  /   (   1  ‚àí  x   )          normal-Œ®  x     x    1  normal-‚àí  x      Œ®(x)=x/(1‚àíx)   , so that 16         h  t    (  x  )    =    Œ®   -  1     (    2   -  t    Œ®   (  x  )    )    =    x    2  t   +   x   (   1  -   2  t    )        .           subscript  h  t   x      superscript  normal-Œ®    1       superscript  2    t    normal-Œ®  x           x     superscript  2  t     x    1   superscript  2  t          h_{t}(x)=\Psi^{-1}(2^{-t}\Psi(x))=\frac{x}{2^{t}+x(1-2^{t})}~{}.
