   Sobolev spaces for planar domains      Sobolev spaces for planar domains   In mathematics , Sobolev spaces for planar domains are one of the principal techniques used in the theory of partial differential equations for solving the Dirichlet and Neumann boundary value problems for the Laplacian in a bounded domain in the plane with smooth boundary. The methods use the theory of bounded operators on Hilbert space . They can be used to deduce regularity properties of solutions and to solve the corresponding eigenvalue problems.  Sobolev spaces with boundary conditions  Let be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. Since   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   is contained in a large square in , it can be regarded as a domain in by identifying opposite sides of the square. The theory of Sobolev spaces on can be found in , an account which is followed in several later textbooks such as  and .  For   k   k   k   an integer, the (restricted) Sobolev space     H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   is defined as the closure of    C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)   in the standard Sobolev space  .   L 2 (Ω)}} .    Vanishing properties on boundary: For    k  >  0      k  0    k>0   the elements of    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   are referred to as " functions on   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   which vanish with their first    k  −  1      k  normal-−  1    k−1   derivatives on    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   ." 1 In fact if agrees with a function in    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   , then ∂  α f }} is in . Let be such that in the Sobolev norm, and set ∂  α f n }} . Thus in    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   . Hence for and  a ∂ x + b ∂ y }} ,           ∬  Ω     (    g   (   D  h   )    +    (   D  g   )   h    )   d   x   d  y    =    lim   n  →  0      ∬  Ω     (    g   (   D   h  n    )    +    (   D  g   )    h  n     )   d   x   d  y     =  0.          subscript  double-integral  normal-Ω         g    D  h        D  g   h    d  x  d  y      subscript    normal-→  n  0      subscript  double-integral  normal-Ω         g    D   subscript  h  n         D  g    subscript  h  n     d  x  d  y          0.     \iint_{\Omega}\left(g(Dh)+(Dg)h\right)\,dx\,dy=\lim_{n\to 0}\iint_{\Omega}%
 \left(g(Dh_{n})+(Dg)h_{n}\right)\,dx\,dy=0.         By Green's theorem this implies             ∫   ∂  Ω     g  k    =  0   ,   k  =   h   cos   (   𝐧  ⋅   (  a  ,  b  )    )       ,     formulae-sequence      subscript     normal-Ω      g  k    0     k    h     normal-⋅  𝐧   a  b         \int_{\partial\Omega}gk=0,\qquad k=h\cos\left(\mathbf{n}\cdot(a,b)\right),         where   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}   the unit normal to the boundary. Since such   k   k   k   form a dense subspace of , it follows that    g  =  0      g  0    g=0   on    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   .    Support properties: Let be the complement of    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   and define restricted Sobolev spaces analogously for . Both sets of spaces have a natural pairing with . The Sobolev space for   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   is the annihilator in the Sobolev space for of and that for is the annihilator of    C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)   . 2 In fact this is proved by locally applying a small translation to move the domain inside itself and then smoothing by a smooth convolution operator.    Suppose   g   g   g   in annihilates . By compactness, there are finitely many opens covering    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   such that the closure of is disjoint from    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   and each is an open disc about a boundary point such that in small translations in the direction of the normal vector carry    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   into   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   . Add an open with closure in to produce a cover of and let be a partition of unity subordinate to this cover. If translation by   n   n   n   is denoted by , then          {   g  t   =   ψ  0   g  +   ∑   i  =  1   N    ψ  n    λ   t   n  i     g  }   ⟶  g  ,     fragments   fragments  normal-{   subscript  g  t     subscript  ψ  0   g    superscript   subscript     i  1    N    subscript  ψ  n    subscript  λ    t   subscript  n  i     g  normal-}   normal-⟶  g  normal-,    \left\{g_{t}=\psi_{0}g+\sum_{i=1}^{N}\psi_{n}\lambda_{tn_{i}}g\right\}%
 \longrightarrow g,         as   t   t   t   decreases to   0   0    and still lie in the annihilator, indeed they are in the annihilator for a larger domain than , the complement of which lies in   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   . Convolving by smooth functions of small support produces smooth approximations in the annihilator of a slightly smaller domain still with complement in   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   . These are necessarily smooth functions of compact support in   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   .    Further vanishing properties on the boundary: The characterization in terms of annihilators shows that lies in    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   if (and only if) it and its derivatives of order less than   k   k   k   vanish on    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   . 3 In fact   f   f   f   can be extended to by setting it to be   0   0    on . The extension   F   F   F   defines as element in using the formula            ∥  h  ∥    (  k  )   2   =    ∑   j  =  0   k     (      k      j      )     ∥     ∂  x  j    ∂  y   k  -  j     h   ∥   2      ,       superscript   subscript   norm  h   k   2     superscript   subscript     j  0    k      binomial  k  j    superscript   norm     superscript   subscript   x   j    superscript   subscript   y     k  j     h    2       \|h\|_{(k)}^{2}=\sum_{j=0}^{k}{k\choose j}\left\|\partial_{x}^{j}\partial_{y}^%
 {k-j}h\right\|^{2},         and satisfies     (  F  ,  g  )   =  0       F  g   0    (F,g)=0   for g in .    Duality: For    k  ≥  0      k  normal-≥  0    k≥0   , define to be the orthogonal complement of in . Let be the orthogonal projection onto , so that  I − P k }} is the orthogonal projection onto . When    k  =  0      k  0    k=0   , this just gives L 2 (Ω)}} . If and , then           (  f  ,  g  )   =   (  f  ,    P  k   g   )    .       f  g    f     subscript  P  k   g      (f,g)=(f,P_{k}g).         This implies that under the pairing between and , and are each other's duals.    Approximation by smooth functions: The image of    C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)   is dense in for    k  ≤  0      k  normal-≤  0    k≤0   . This is obvious for    k  =  0      k  0    k=0   since the sum    C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)   + is dense in . Density for    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)       Canonical isometries: The operator gives an isometry of    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   into and of    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   onto . In fact the first statement follows because it is true on . That is an isometry on    C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)   follows using the density of    f  ,   g  ∈  C   (  Ω  )       f    g  normal-∈  C  normal-Ω     f,g∈C(Ω)   in : for   ∆   normal-∆   ∆   we have:     \begin{align}     \left \|P_k (I+\Delta)^k f \right \|_{(-k)} &= \sup_{\|g\|_{(-k)}=1} \left|\left ((I+\Delta)^kf,g \right )_{(-k)} \right | \\ &= \sup_{\|g\|_{(-k)}=1} |(f,g)| \\ &=\|f\|_{(k)}. \end{align}   Since the adjoint map between the duals can by identified with this map, it follows that is a unitary map.   Application to Dirichlet problem  Invertibility of   ∆   normal-∆   ∆     The operator    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   defines an isomorphism between   0   0    and . In fact it is a Fredholm operator of index   ∆   normal-∆   ∆   . The kernel of   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   in consists of constant functions and none of these except zero vanish on the boundary of    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   . Hence the kernel of    (  0  )    0   (0)   is   ∆   normal-∆   ∆   and     ∆  f   =  g        normal-∆  f   g    ∆f=g   is invertible.  In particular the equation    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   has a unique solution in   g   g   g   for   T   T   T   in .  Eigenvalue problem  Let     T  =    R  1    Δ   -  1     R  0     ,      T     subscript  R  1    superscript  normal-Δ    1     subscript  R  0      T=R_{1}\Delta^{-1}R_{0},   be the operator on defined by     H   H   H     where is the inclusion of in and of   T   T   T   in , both compact operators by Rellich's theorem. The operator     (   T  f   ,  f  )   >  0         T  f   f   0    (Tf,f)>0   is compact, self-adjoint and with   f   f   f   for all      T   f  n    =    μ  n    f  n     ,     μ  n   >  0   ,    μ  n   →  0.       formulae-sequence      T   subscript  f  n       subscript  μ  n    subscript  f  n      formulae-sequence     subscript  μ  n   0    normal-→   subscript  μ  n   0.      Tf_{n}=\mu_{n}f_{n},\qquad\mu_{n}>0,\mu_{n}\to 0.   . By the spectral theorem , there is a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions in with      H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)     Since , lies in       Δ   f  n    =    λ  n    f  n     ,     λ  n   >  0   ,    λ  n   →  ∞     .     formulae-sequence      normal-Δ   subscript  f  n       subscript  λ  n    subscript  f  n      formulae-sequence     subscript  λ  n   0    normal-→   subscript  λ  n        \Delta f_{n}=\lambda_{n}f_{n},\qquad\lambda_{n}>0,\lambda_{n}\to\infty.   . Setting  μ − n }} , the are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian:         Δ  f   =  u   ,    u  ∈    H   -  1     (  Ω  )     ,   f  ∈    H  0  1    (  Ω  )       ,     formulae-sequence      normal-Δ  f   u    formulae-sequence    u     superscript  H    1    normal-Ω      f     subscript   superscript  H  1   0   normal-Ω       \Delta f=u,\qquad u\in H^{-1}(\Omega),f\in H^{1}_{0}(\Omega),     Sobolev spaces without boundary condition  To determine the regularity properties of the eigenfunctions and solutions of      H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)     enlargements of the Sobolev spaces   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   have to be considered. Let be the space of smooth functions on    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   which with their derivatives extend continuously to       ∥  f  ∥    (  k  )   2   =    ∑   j  =  0   k     (     k      j     )     ∥     ∂  x  j    ∂  y   k  -  j     f   ∥   2      .       superscript   subscript   norm  f   k   2     superscript   subscript     j  0    k      binomial  k  j    superscript   norm     superscript   subscript   x   j    superscript   subscript   y     k  j     f    2       \|f\|_{(k)}^{2}=\sum_{j=0}^{k}{k\choose j}\left\|\partial_{x}^{j}\partial_{y}^%
 {k-j}f\right\|^{2}.   . By Borel's lemma , these are precisely the restrictions of smooth functions on . The Sobolev space is defined to the Hilbert space completion of this space for the norm      C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)     This norm agrees with the Sobolev norm on    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   so that    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   can be regarded as a closed subspace of . Unlike    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   , is not naturally a subspace of , but the map restricting smooth functions from to    C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)   is continuous for the Sobolev norm so extends by continuity to a map .   Invariance under diffeomorphism: Any diffeomorphism between the closures of two smooth domains induces an isomorphism between the Sobolev space. This is a simple consequence of the chain rule for derivatives.  Extension theorem: The restriction of to the orthogonal complement of its kernel defines an isomorphism onto . The extension map is defined to be the inverse of this map: it is an isomorphism (not necessarily norm preserving) of onto the orthogonal complement of such that  I }} . On   E   E   E   , it agrees with the natural inclusion map. Bounded extension maps of this kind from to were constructed first constructed by Hestenes and Lions. For smooth curves the Seeley extension theorem provides an extension which is continuous in all the Sobolev norms. A version of the extension which applies in the case where the boundary is just a Lipschitz curve was constructed by Calderón using singular integral operators and generalized by .    It is sufficient to construct an extension    I  ×  𝐓      I  normal-×  𝐓    I×\mathbf{T}   for a neighbourhood of a closed annulus, since a collar around the boundary is diffeomorphic to an annulus   I   I   I   with   𝐓   𝐓   \mathbf{T}   a closed interval in   ψ   ψ   ψ   . Taking a smooth bump function    0  ≤  ψ  ≤  1      0  normal-≤  ψ  normal-≤  1    0≤ψ≤1   with     E   (   ψ  f   )    +    (   1  −  ψ   )   f         E    ψ  f        1  normal-−  ψ   f     E(ψf)+(1−ψ)f   , equal to 1 near the boundary and 0 outside the collar,   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   will provide an extension on   I   I   I   . On the annulus, the problem reduces to finding an extension for in . Using a partition of unity the task of extending reduces to a neighbourhood of the end points of      E   (  f  )    =    ∑   m  =  0   k     a  m   f   (   -   x   m  +  1     )      .        E  f     superscript   subscript     m  0    k      subscript  a  m   f      x    m  1         E(f)=\sum_{m=0}^{k}a_{m}f\left(-\frac{x}{m+1}\right).   . Assuming 0 is the left end point, an extension is given locally by           ∑   m  =  0   k      (    -  m   -  1   )    -  k     a  m     =  1.        superscript   subscript     m  0    k      superscript      m   1     k     subscript  a  m     1.    \sum_{m=0}^{k}(-m-1)^{-k}a_{m}=1.         Matching the first derivatives of order k or less at 0, gives         E   (  f  )       E  f    E(f)         This matrix equation is solvable because the determinant is non-zero by Vandermonde's formula . It is straightforward to check that the formula for    ⋯  ⊂    H  2    (  Ω  )    ⊂    H  1    (  Ω  )    ⊂    H  0    (  Ω  )    ⊂    H  0   -  1     (  Ω  )    ⊂    H  0   -  2     (  Ω  )    ⊂  ⋯        normal-⋯     superscript  H  2   normal-Ω           superscript  H  1   normal-Ω           superscript  H  0   normal-Ω           subscript   superscript  H    1    0   normal-Ω           subscript   superscript  H    2    0   normal-Ω        normal-⋯     \cdots\subset H^{2}(\Omega)\subset H^{1}(\Omega)\subset H^{0}(\Omega)\subset H%
 ^{-1}_{0}(\Omega)\subset H^{-2}_{0}(\Omega)\subset\cdots   , when appropriately modified with bump functions, leads to an extension which is continuous in the above Sobolev norm. 4     Restriction theorem: The restriction map is surjective with H(Ω c )}} . This is an immediate consequence of the extension theorem and the support properties for Sobolev spaces with boundary condition.    Duality:  is naturally the dual of H − k 0 (Ω). Again this is an immediate consequence of the restriction theorem. Thus the Sobolev spaces form a chain:        f   f   f         The differentiation operators carry each Sobolev space into the larger one with index 1 less.    Sobolev embedding theorem:  is contained in . This is an immediate consequence of the extension theorem and the Sobolev embedding theorem for .    Characterization:  consists of    C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)   in H 0 (Ω)}} such that all the derivatives ∂ α f lie in for |α| ≤ k .Here the derivatives are taken within the chain of Sobolev spaces above. See:     Since       (   f  α   ,  φ  )   =     (   -  1   )    |  α  |     (  f  ,    ∂  α   φ   )     ,     |  α  |   ≤  k   ,   φ  ∈    C  c  ∞    (  Ω  )       .     formulae-sequence      subscript  f  α   φ      superscript    1     α     f    superscript   α   φ       formulae-sequence      α   k     φ     subscript   superscript  C    c   normal-Ω       \left(f_{\alpha},\varphi\right)=(-1)^{|\alpha|}\left(f,\partial^{\alpha}%
 \varphi\right),\qquad|\alpha|\leq k,\varphi\in C^{\infty}_{c}(\Omega).   is weakly dense in , this condition is equivalent to the existence of functions f α such that        f   f   f         To prove the characterization, note that if   f   f   f   is in , then lies in H k −|α| (Ω) and hence in L 2 (Ω)}} . Conversely the result is well known for the Sobolev spaces : the assumption implies that the is in and the corresponding condition on the Fourier coefficients of   f   f   f   shows that     −  −  δ   ,   δ  ×  𝐓        normal-−  normal-−  δ     δ  normal-×  𝐓     −−δ,δ×\mathbf{T}   lies in . Similarly the result an be proved directly for an annulus   f   f   f   . In fact by the argument on the restriction of    R  >  1      R  1    R>1   to any smaller annulus [−δ',δ'] × T lies in : equivalently the restriction of the function  f ( Rx , y )}} lies in for    R  →  1      R  normal-→  1    R→1   . On the other hand in as   f   f   f   , so that   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   must lie in . The case for a general domain   f   f   f   reduces to these two cases since    f  =    ψ  f   +    (   1  −  ψ   )   f        f      ψ  f       1  normal-−  ψ   f      f=ψf+(1−ψ)f   can be written as   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   with ψ a bump function supported in    1  −  ψ      1  normal-−  ψ    1−ψ   such that   f   f   f   is supported in a collar of the boundary.    Regularity theorem: If   f   f   f   in has both derivatives and in then    C   (  Ω  )       C  normal-Ω    C(Ω)   lies in . This is an immediate consequence of the characterization of above.

Solving the Dirichlet problem  The dual Dirichlet problem can be used to solve the Dirichlet problem:     g   g   g     By Borel's lemma   G   G   G   is the restriction of a function   F   F   F   in . Let     ∆  F   =   ∆  G         normal-∆  F     normal-∆  G     ∆F=∆G   be the smooth solution of    F  =  0      F  0    F=0   with    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   on    f  =   G  −  F       f    G  normal-−  F     f=G−F   . Then   g   g   g   solves the Dirichlet problem. By the maximal principle , the solution is unique. 6  Application to smooth Riemann mapping theorem  The solution to the Dirichlet problem can be used to prove a strong form of the Riemann mapping theorem for simply connected domains with smooth boundary. The method also applies to a region diffeomorphic to an annulus. 7 For multiply connected regions with smooth boundary  have given a method for mapping the region onto a disc with circular holes. Their method involves solving the Dirichlet problem with a non-linear boundary condition. They construct a function   g   g   g   such that:      Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   is harmonic in the interior of    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   ;  On   κ   κ   κ   we have:  κ − Ke G }} , where    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   is the curvature of the boundary curve, is the derivative in the direction normal to   K   K   K   and   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   is constant on each boundary component.   gives a proof of the Riemann mapping theorem for a simply connected domain    0  ∈  Ω      0  normal-∈  normal-Ω    0∈Ω   with smooth boundary. Translating if necessary, it can be assumed that    U   (  z  )       U  z    U(z)   . The solution of the Dirichlet problem shows that there is a unique smooth function    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   on   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   which is harmonic in    −  l  o  g   |  z  |       normal-−  l  o  g    z     −log|z|   and equals    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   on     G   (  z  )    =    l  o  g   |  z  |    +   U   (  z  )           G  z       l  o  g    z      U  z      G(z)=log|z|+U(z)   . Define the Green's function by    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   . It vanishes on   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   and is harmonic on   0   0    away from   V   V   V   . The harmonic conjugate    U   U   U   of   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   is the unique real function on    U  +   i  V       U    i  V     U+iV   such that    U  x     subscript  U  x    \displaystyle U_{x}   is holomorphic. As such it must satisfy the Cauchy-Riemann equations :        V   (  z  )    =     ∫  0  z   -    U  y   d  x    +    V  x   d  y     ,        V  z        superscript   subscript   0   z      subscript  U  y   d  x       subscript  V  x   d  y      V(z)=\int_{0}^{z}-U_{y}dx+V_{x}dy,     The solution is given by      Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}     where the integral is taken over any path in   U   U   U   . It is easily verified that and exist and are given by the corresponding derivatives of   V   V   V   . Thus    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   is a smooth function on   0   0    , vanishing at    f  =   U  +   i  V        f    U    i  V      f=U+iV   . By the Cauchy-Riemann    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   is smooth on   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   , holomorphic on     f   (  0  )    =  0        f  0   0    f(0)=0   and    H  =    a  r  g  z   +   V   (  z  )         H      a  r  g  z     V  z      H=argz+V(z)   . The function    2  π      2  π    2π   is only defined up to multiples of     F   (  z  )    =   e    G   (  z  )    +   i  H   (  z  )      =   z   e   f   (  z  )              F  z    superscript  e      G  z     i  H  z            z   superscript  e    f  z        F(z)=e^{G(z)+iH(z)}=ze^{f(z)}   , but the function     Ω   normal-Ω   Ω     is a holomorphic on    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   and smooth on     F   (  0  )    =  0        F  0   0    F(0)=0   . By construction,     |   F   (  z  )    |   =  1          F  z    1    |F(z)|=1   and    z  ∈  ∂  Ω      z  normal-∈  normal-∂  normal-Ω    z∈∂Ω   for   z   z   z   . Since   1   1   1   has winding number     F   (  z  )       F  z    F(z)   , so too does     F   (  z  )    =  0        F  z   0    F(z)=0   . On the other hand    z  =  0      z  0    z=0   only for   F   F   F   where there is a simple zero. So by the argument principle    𝐃   𝐃   \mathbf{D}   assumes every value in the unit disc,    F  ′      F  normal-′    F′   , exactly once and   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   does not vanish inside   H   H   H   . To check that the derivative on the boundary curve is non-zero amounts to computing the derivative of , i.e. the derivative of   G   G   G   should not vanish on the boundary curve. By the Cauchy-Riemann equations these tangential derivative are up to a sign the directional derivative in the direction of the normal to the boundary. But   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   vanishes on the boundary and is strictly negative in   G   G   G   since F {{!}} {{=}} e G }} . The Hopf lemma implies that the directional derivative of   F   F   F   in the direction of the outward normal is strictly positive. So on the boundary curve,   F   F   F   has nowhere vanishing derivative. Since the boundary curve has winding number one,    F  :    Ω  ¯   →   𝐃  ¯       normal-:  F     normal-¯  normal-Ω   normal-→   normal-¯  𝐃      F:\overline{Ω}→\overline{\mathbf{D}}   defines a diffeomorphism of the boundary curve onto the unit circle. Accordingly    Ω  →  𝐃      normal-Ω  normal-→  𝐃    Ω→\mathbf{D}   is a smooth diffeomorphism, which restricts to a holomorphic map   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   and a smooth diffeomorphism between the boundaries.  Similar arguments can be applied to prove the Riemann mapping theorem for a doubly connected domain   u   u   u   bounded by simple smooth curves (the inner curve) and (the outer curve). By translating we can assume 1 lies on the outer boundary. Let    U  =  0      U  0    U=0   be the smooth solution of the Dirichlet problem with    −  1      normal-−  1    −1   on the outer curve and   z   z   z   on the inner curve. By the maximum principle    Ω   normal-Ω   Ω        U   U   U     on each boundary curve. The harmonic conjugate     V   (  z  )    =     ∫  1  z   -     u  y    d  x    +     u  x    d  y          V  z        superscript   subscript   1   z      subscript  u  y   d  x       subscript  u  x   d  y      V(z)=\int_{1}^{z}-u_{y}\,dx+u_{x}\,dy   of    2  π      2  π    2π   can again be defined by       F   (  z  )    =   e    U   (  z  )    +   i  V   (  z  )            F  z    superscript  e      U  z     i  V  z       \displaystyle{F(z)=e^{U(z)+iV(z)}}     and is well-defined up to multiples of    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{Ω}   . The function     Ω   normal-Ω   Ω     is smooth on     |  F  |   =  1        F   1    |F|=1   and holomorphic in   F   F   F   . On the outer curve   1   1   1   and on the inner curve F {{!}} {{=}} e − c {{=}} r . The tangential derivatives on the outer curves are nowhere vanishing by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, since the normal derivatives are nowhere vanishing. The normalization of the integrals implies that   0   0    restricts to a diffeomorphism between the boundary curves and the two concentric circles.

 \oplus H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega)\to(0),     It follows that there is a trace map τ of H k (Ω) onto H k − ½ (∂Ω). Indeed take a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary and a smooth function ψ supported in the collar and equal to 1 near the boundary. Multiplication by ψ carries functions into H k of the collar, which can be identified with H k of an annulus for which there is a trace map. The invariance under diffeomorphims (or coordinate change) of the half-integer Sobolev spaces on the circle follows from the fact that an equivalent norm on H k + ½ ( T ) is given by 11        (  0  )   →    H  0  k    (  Ω  )    →    H  k    (  Ω  )    →    ⊕   j  =  1   k     H   j  -   1  2      (   ∂  Ω   )     →   (  0  )    .       normal-→  0     subscript   superscript  H  k   0   normal-Ω     normal-→       superscript  H  k   normal-Ω     normal-→      superscript   subscript  direct-sum    j  1    k      superscript  H    j    1  2       normal-Ω       normal-→    0     (0)\to H^{k}_{0}(\Omega)\to H^{k}(\Omega)\to\bigoplus_{j=1}^{k}H^{j-\frac{1}{2%
 }}(\partial\Omega)\to(0).     It is also a consequence of the properties of τ and E (the "trace theorem"). 12 In fact any diffeomorphism f of T induces a diffeomorphism F of T 2 by acting only on the second factor. Invariance of H k ( T 2 ) under the induced map F * therefore implies invariance of H k − ½ ( T ) under f *, since f * = τ ∘ F * ∘ E .  Further consequences of the trace theorem are the two exact sequences 13 14     f   f   f     and     Δ   normal-Δ   Δ     where the last map takes f in H 2 (Ω) to f | ∂Ω and ∂ n f | ∂Ω . There are generalizations of these sequences to H k (Ω) involving higher powers of the normal derivative in the trace map:     Ω   normal-Ω   Ω     The trace map to takes f to ∂Ω }}  Abstract formulation of boundary value problems  The Sobolev space approach to the Neumann problem cannot be phrased quite as directly as that for the Dirichlet problem. The main reason is that for a function    H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)   in , the normal derivative ∂Ω }} cannot be a priori defined at the level of Sobolev spaces. Instead an alternative formulation of boundary value problems for the Laplacian   Δ   normal-Δ   Δ   on a bounded region   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   in the plane is used. It employs Dirichlet forms , sesqulinear bilinear forms on ,   Δ   normal-Δ   Δ   or an intermediate closed subspace. Integration over the boundary is not involved in defining the Dirichlet form. Instead, if the Dirichlet form satisfies a certain positivity condition, termed coerciveness , solution can be shown to exist in a weak sense, so-called "weak solutions". A general regularity theorem than implies that the solutions of the boundary value problem must lie in , so that they are strong solutions and satisfy boundary conditions involving the restriction of a function and its normal derivative to the boundary. The Dirichlet problem can equally well be phrased in these terms, but because the trace map ∂Ω }} is already defined on , Dirichlet forms do not need to be mentioned explicitly and the operator formulation is more direct. A unified discussion is given in  and briefly summarised below. It is explained how the Dirichlet problem, as discussed above, fits into this framework. Then a detailed treatment of the Neumann problem from this point of view is given following .  The Hilbert space formulation of boundary value problems for the Laplacian    D   (  f  ,  g  )       D   f  g     D(f,g)   on a bounded region     D   (  f  ,  g  )    =   (   ∆  f   ,  g  )         D   f  g       normal-∆  f   g     D(f,g)=(∆f,g)   in the plane proceeds from the following data: 15   A closed subspace .

A weak solution of the boundary value problem given initial data    H  =   H   (  Ω  )        H    H  normal-Ω     H=H(Ω)   in is defined by the following:         D   (  f  ,  g  )    =    (   Δ  f   ,  g  )   ,  f    ,   g  ∈  H    .     formulae-sequence      D   f  g        normal-Δ  f   g   f      g  H     D(f,g)=(\Delta f,g),\qquad f,g\in H.

Hence the Neumann problem has a unique solution up to adding constants. 16  Consider the Hermitian form on defined by      H   (  Ω  )       H  normal-Ω    H(Ω)     Since is in duality with      D   (  u  ,  v  )    =   (   L  u   ,  v  )    .

The difference quotients can be formed for the flow and lie in , so the first inequality is applicable:     g   g   g     The commutators are uniformly bounded as operators from to   h   h   h   . This is equivalent to checking the inequality        [   δ  h   ,   ∑    a  α    ∂  α     ]   =    (     δ  h    (   a  α   )    ∘   R  h    )    ∂  α     .        superscript  δ  h        subscript  a  α    superscript   α             superscript  δ  h    subscript  a  α     subscript  R  h     superscript   α      \left[\delta^{h},\sum a_{\alpha}\partial^{\alpha}\right]=\left(\delta^{h}(a_{%

This can be checked directly on an annulus, using invariance of Sobolev spaces under dffeomorphisms and the fact that for the annulus the commutator of with a differential operator is obtained by applying the difference operator to the coefficients after having applied to the function: 17      Y  w      Y  w    Yw     Hence the difference quotients are uniformly bounded, and therefore with         ∥   V  w   ∥    (  1  )    ≤    C  ′′    (     ∥   L  w   ∥    (  0  )    +    ∥  w  ∥    (  1  )     )     .       subscript   norm    V  w    1      superscript  C  ′′      subscript   norm    L  w    0    subscript   norm  w   1       \|Vw\|_{(1)}\leq C^{\prime\prime}\left(\|Lw\|_{(0)}+\|w\|_{(1)}\right).     Hence and   W   W   W   satisfies a similar inequality to   A   A   \displaystyle A   :       (   L  w   ,  φ  )   =   (   ∆  w   ,  φ  )          L  w   φ      normal-∆  w   φ     (Lw,φ)=(∆w,φ)     Let    φ  ∈  C   (  Ω  )       φ  normal-∈  C  normal-Ω    φ∈C(Ω)   be the orthogonal vector field. As for the Dirichlet problem, to show that , it suffices to show that .  To check this, it is enough to show that . As before      L  w      L  w    Lw     are vector fields. On the other hand    ∆  w      normal-∆  w    ∆w   for   Ω   normal-Ω   Ω   , so that    (    W  2   w   ,  φ  )        superscript  W  2   w   φ    \displaystyle\left(W^{2}w,\varphi\right)   and     L  w   =   ∆  w         L  w     normal-∆  w     Lw=∆w   define the same distribution on   φ   φ   φ   . Hence      V  w      V  w    Vw     Since the terms on the right hand side are pairings with functions in , the regularity criterion shows that . Hence     ∥   W  w   ∥    (  1  )      subscript   norm    W  w    1    \displaystyle\|Ww\|_{(1)}   since both terms lie in and have the same inner products with     ∥  w  ∥    (  2  )      subscript   norm  w   2    \displaystyle\|w\|_{(2)}   's.  Moreover the inequalities for     ∥  u  ∥    (  2  )      subscript   norm  u   2    \displaystyle\|u\|_{(2)}   show that      (  f  ,  v  )     f  v    \displaystyle(f,v)     Hence           ∂  n   u   |    ∂  Ω    =  0   ,       evaluated-at    subscript   n   u     normal-Ω    0    \partial_{n}u|_{\partial\Omega}=0,     It follows that  v + w ∈ H 2 (Ω)}} .

Thus for ,     u   u   u     Hence the Neumann boundary conditions are satisfied:      k  ≥  1      k  normal-≥  1    k≥1     where the left hand side is regarded as an element of and hence .  Regularity of strong solutions  The main result here states that if and ∂Ω {{=}} 0}} , then and      k  =  1      k  1    k=1     for some constant independent of   u   u   u   .  Like the ocrresponding result for the Dirichlet problem, this is proved by induction on    k  =  0      k  0    k=0   . For       Z  u   |    ∂  Ω    =  0.       evaluated-at    Z  u     normal-Ω    0.    Zu|_{\partial\Omega}=0.   ,   Z   Z   Z   is also a weak solution of the Neumann problem so satisfies the estimate above for   Y   Y   Y   . The Neumann boundary condition can be written     Z   Z   Z     Since   D   D   D   commutes with the vector field     D  u   =  f        D  u   f    Du=f   corresponding to the period flow , the inductive method of proof used for the Dirichlet problem works equally well in this case: for the difference quotients preserve the boundary condition when expressed in terms of   f   f   f   . 18  Smoothness of eigenfunctions  It follows by induction from the regularity theorem for the Neumann problem that the eigenfunctions of   u   u   u   in lie in . Moreover any solution of   u   u   u   with   u   u   u   in and    ∂  Ω      normal-∂  normal-Ω    ∂Ω   in must have    {         Δ  f   |   Ω   =  0             ∂  n   f   |    ∂  Ω    =  g      g  ∈    C  ∞    (   ∂  Ω   )           cases     evaluated-at    normal-Δ  f   normal-Ω   0   otherwise     evaluated-at    subscript   n   f     normal-Ω    g     g     superscript  C      normal-Ω       \begin{cases}\Delta f|_{\Omega}=0\\
 \partial_{n}f|_{\partial\Omega}=g&g\in C^{\infty}(\partial\Omega)\end{cases}   in . In both cases by the vanishing properties, the normal derivatives of the eigenfunctions and   g   g   g   vanish on   F   F   F   .  Solving the associated Neumann problem  The method above can be used to solve the associated Neumann boundary value problem:     u   u   u     By Borel's lemma     ∆  u   =   −  ∆  F         normal-∆  u     normal-−  normal-∆  F     ∆u=−∆F   is the restriction of a function . Let    f  =   u  +  F       f    u  F     f=u+F   be a smooth function such that  G }} near the boundary. Let $u$ be the solution of $∆ u = −∆ F$ with 0}} . Then $f = u + F$ solves the boundary value problem. 19  Notes  References                    "  Category:Partial differential equations  Category:Harmonic analysis  Category:Operator theory  Category:Functional analysis     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
