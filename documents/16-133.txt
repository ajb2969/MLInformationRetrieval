(+)-epi-alpha-bisabolol synthase

(+)-epi-alpha-bisabolol synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (+)-epi-alpha-bisabolol-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  (+)-epi-alpha-bisabolol + diphosphate


This enzyme is isolated from the plant Phyla dulcis (Aztec sweet herb).
