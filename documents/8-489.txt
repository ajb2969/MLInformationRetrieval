Hata model for open areas

The Hata model for open areas, also known as the Okumura–Hata model from its origins in the Okumura model, is the most widely used model for predicting the behavior of cellular radio transmissions in open areas. It further exploits the graphical information from the Okumura model. Two additional varieties for transmission are urban areas and suburban areas.
The Hata model for open areas predicts the total path loss along a link of terrestrial microwave or other type of cellular communications. It is a function of transmission frequency and the median path loss in urban areas.
Applicable to/under conditions
This version of Hata model is applicable to the transmissions in open areas where no obstructions block the transmission link. It is suited for both point-to-point and broadcast transmissions.
Coverage
Frequency: 150 MHz to 1.5 GHz
Mathematical formulation
The Hata model for open areas is formulated as:



where

LO = Path loss in open area. Unit: decibel (dB)
LU = Path loss in urban areas for small sized city. Unit: decibel (dB)
f = Frequency of transmission. Unit: Megahertz (MHz).

Points to note
This model is dependent on the Hata model for urban areas.
