   Baire function      Baire function   In mathematics , Baire functions are functions obtained from continuous functions by transfinite iteration of the operation of forming pointwise limits of sequences of functions. They were introduced by . A Baire set is a set whose characteristic function is a Baire function (not necessarily of any particular class, as defined below).  Classification of Baire functions  Baire functions of class n , for any countable ordinal number  n , form a vector space of real-valued functions defined on a topological space , as follows.   The Baire class 0 functions are the continuous functions .    The Baire class 1 functions are those functions which are the pointwise limit of a sequence of Baire class 0 functions.    In general, the Baire class n functions are all functions which are the pointwise limit of a sequence of functions of Baire class less than n .   Some authors define the classes slightly differently, by removing all functions of class less than n from the functions of class n . This means that each Baire function has a well defined class, but the functions of given class no longer form a vector space.  Henri Lebesgue proved that (for functions on the unit interval) each Baire class of a countable ordinal number contains functions not in any smaller class, and that there exist functions which are not in any Baire class.  Baire class 1  Examples:   The derivative of any differentiable function is of class 1. An example of a differentiable function whose derivative is not continuous (at x =0) is the function equal to     x  2    sin   (   1  /  x   )         superscript  x  2       1  x      x^{2}\sin(1/x)   when x ≠0, and 0 when x =0. An infinite sum of similar functions (scaled and displaced by rational numbers) can even give a differentiable function whose derivative is discontinuous on a dense set. However, it necessarily has points of continuity, which follows easily from The Baire Characterisation Theorem (below; take K = X = R ).  The function equal to 1 if x is an integer and 0 otherwise. (An infinite number of large discontinuities.)  The function that is 0 for irrational x and 1/ q for a rational number p / q (in reduced form). (A dense set of discontinuities, namely the set of rational numbers.)  The characteristic function of the Cantor set , which gives 1 if x is in the Cantor set and 0 otherwise. This function is 0 for an uncountable set of x values, and 1 for an uncountable set. It is discontinuous wherever it equals 1 and continuous wherever it equals 0. It is approximated by the continuous functions      g  n    (  x  )    =   max   (  0  ,   1  -   n  d   (  x  ,  C  )     )           subscript  g  n   x     0    1    n  d   x  C        g_{n}(x)=\max(0,{1-nd(x,C)})   , where    d   (  x  ,  C  )       d   x  C     d(x,C)   is the distance of x from the nearest point in the Cantor set.   The Baire Characterisation Theorem states that a real valued function f defined on a Banach space X is a Baire-1 function if and only if for every non-empty closed subset K of X, the restriction of f to K has a point of continuity relative to the topology of K.  By another theorem of Baire, for every Baire-1 function the points of continuity are a comeager  G δ set .  Baire class 2  Examples:   An example of a Baire class two function on the interval [0,1] that is not of class 1 is the characteristic function of the rational numbers,    χ  ℚ     subscript  χ  ℚ    \chi_{\mathbb{Q}}   , also known as the Dirichlet function . It is discontinuous everywhere.
