   Clifford semigroup      Clifford semigroup   A Clifford semigroup (sometimes also called "inverse Clifford semigroup") is a completely regular  inverse semigroup . It is an inverse semigroup with 1      x   x   -  1     =    x   -  1    x         x   superscript  x    1        superscript  x    1    x     xx^{-1}=x^{-1}x   . Examples of Clifford semigroups are groups and commutative inverse semigroups.  In a Clifford semigroup, 2       x  y   =   y  x    ↔     x   -  1    y   =   y   x   -  1         normal-↔      x  y     y  x         superscript  x    1    y     y   superscript  x    1        xy=yx\leftrightarrow x^{-1}y=yx^{-1}   .
