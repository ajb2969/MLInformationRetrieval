   Voronoi deformation density      Voronoi deformation density   Voronoi deformation density (VDD) is a method employed in computational chemistry to compute the atomic charge distribution of a molecule in order to provide information about its chemical properties. The method is based on the partitioning of space into non-overlapping atomic areas modelled as Voronoi cells and then computing the deformation density within those cells (i.e. the extent to which electron density differs from that of an unbonded atom). 1  The VDD charge Q A of atom A is computed as the (numerical) integral of the deformation density ∆ ρ ( r ) = ρ ( r ) – Σ B ρ B ( r ) associated with the formation of the molecule from its atoms over the volume of the Voronoi cell of atom A:       Q  A   =   -    ∫   Voronoi cell  A      (    ρ   (  𝐫  )    -    ∑  B     ρ  B    (  𝐫  )      )   d  𝐫          subscript  Q  A       subscript     Voronoi cell  A          ρ  𝐫     subscript   B      subscript  ρ  B   𝐫     d  𝐫       Q_{A}=-\int\limits_{\text{Voronoi cell }A}\Big(\rho(\mathbf{r})-\sum_{B}\rho_{%
 B}(\mathbf{r})\Big)d\mathbf{r}     The Voronoi cell of atom A is defined as the compartment of space bounded by the bond midplanes on and perpendicular to all bond axes between nucleus A and its neighboring nuclei (cf. the Wigner–Seitz cells in crystals). The Voronoi cell of atom A is therefore the region of space closer to nucleus A than to any other nucleus. Furthermore, ρ ( r ) is the electron density of the molecule and Σ B ρ B ( r ) the superposition of atomic densities ρ B of a fictitious promolecule without chemical interactions that is associated with the situation in which all atoms are neutral.  Note that an atomic charge is not a physical observable . Nevertheless, it has been proven a useful means to compactly describe and analyze the electron density distribution in a molecule , which is important for understanding the behavior of the latter. In this connection, it is an asset of VDD atomic charges Q A that they have a rather straightforward and transparent interpretation. Instead of measuring the amount of charge associated with a particular atom A, Q A directly monitors how much charge flows, due to chemical interactions, out of ( Q A > 0) or into ( Q A   "  Category:Computational chemistry     "Voronoi Deformation Density (VDD) Charges: Assessment of the Mulliken, Bader, Hirshfeld, Weinhold, and VDD Methods for Charge Analysis" C.
