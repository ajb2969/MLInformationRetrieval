Totally positive matrix

In mathematics, a totally positive matrix is a square matrix in which the determinant of every square submatrix, including the minors, is not negative.1 A totally positive matrix also has all nonnegative eigenvalues.
Definition
Let



be an n × n matrix, where n, p, k,  are all integers so that:



Then A a totally positive matrix if:2



for all p. Each integer p corresponds to a p × p submatrix of A.
History
Topics which historically led to the development of the theory of total positivity include the study of:3

the spectral properties of kernels and matrices which are totally positive,
ordinary differential equations whose Green's function is totally positive (by M. G. Krein and some colleagues in the mid-1930s),
the variation diminishing properties (started by I. J. Schoenberg in 1930),
Pólya frequency functions (by I. J. Schoenberg in the late 1940s and early 1950s).

Examples
For example, a Vandermonde matrix whose nodes are positive and increasing is a totally positive matrix.
