   Bounded deformation      Bounded deformation   In mathematics , a function of bounded deformation is a function whose distributional derivatives are not quite well-behaved -enough to qualify as functions of bounded variation , although the symmetric part of the derivative matrix does meet that condition. Thought of as deformations of elasto - plastic bodies, functions of bounded deformation play a major role in the mathematical study of materials , e.g. the Francfort-Marigo model of brittle crack evolution .  More precisely, given an open subset Ω of R n , a function u : Ω → R n is said to be of bounded deformation if the symmetrized gradient  ε ( u ) of u ,       ε   (  u  )    =     ∇  u   +   ∇   u  ⊤     2         ε  u        normal-∇  u    normal-∇   superscript  u  top     2     \varepsilon(u)=\frac{\nabla u+\nabla u^{\top}}{2}     is a bounded , symmetric  n × n matrix-valued Radon measure . The collection of all functions of bounded deformation is denoted BD(Ω; R n ), or simply BD, introduced essentially by P.-M.Subsequent in 1978. BD is a strictly larger space than the space BV of functions of bounded variation .  One can show that if u is of bounded deformation then the measure ε ( u ) can be decomposed into three parts: one absolutely continuous with respect to Lebesgue measure , denoted e ( u ) d x ; a jump part, supported on a rectifiable ( n − 1)-dimensional set J u of points where u has two different approximate limits u + and u − , together with a normal vector  ν u ; and a " Cantor part ", which vanishes on Borel sets of finite H n −1 -measure (where H k denotes k -dimensional Hausdorff measure ).  A function u is said to be of special bounded deformation if the Cantor part of ε ( u ) vanishes, so that the measure can be written as      ε   (  u  )   =  e   (  u  )   d  x  +   (   u  +    (  x  )   -   u  -    (  x  )   )   ⊙   ν  u    (  x  )    H   n  -  1    |   J  u   ,     fragments  ε   fragments  normal-(  u  normal-)    e   fragments  normal-(  u  normal-)   d  x    fragments  normal-(   subscript  u     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     subscript  u     fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-)   direct-product   subscript  ν  u    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    superscript  H    n  1    normal-|   subscript  J  u   normal-,    \varepsilon(u)=e(u)\,\mathrm{d}x+\big(u_{+}(x)-u_{-}(x)\big)\odot\nu_{u}(x)H^{%

The collection of all functions of special bounded deformation is denoted SBD(Ω; R n ), or simply SBD.
