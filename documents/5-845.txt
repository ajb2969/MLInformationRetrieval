   Beta Librae      Beta Librae   Beta Librae (β Lib, β Librae) is the Bayer designation for a star in the zodiac  constellation of Libra . It has the traditional name Zubeneschamali and the Latin name Lanx Borealis , 1 meaning "the northern scale [of the Balance]". The name "Zubeneschamali" is derived from the Arabic ّالزُبَانَى الشَمَالِي ( al-zubānā al-šamāliyy ) meaning "The Northern Claw". 2 The apparent visual magnitude of this star is 2.6, 3 making it the brightest member of Libra. From parallax measurements, its distance can be estimated as  from Earth . 4  Description  Based upon the features of its spectrum , Beta Librae has a stellar classification of B8 V, 5 making it a B-type main sequence star . It is about 130 times more luminous than the Sun and has a surface temperature of , 6 double that of the Sun. This high temperature produces light with a simple spectrum, making it ideal for examining the interstellar gas and dust between us and the star. Like many stars of its kind, it is spinning rapidly, over 100 times faster than the Sun with a projected rotational velocity of . 7 The measured angular diameter of the primary star is 0.801 mas . 8 At the estimated distance of this system, this yields a physical size of about 4.9 times the radius of the Sun . 9 This type of massive, hydrogen-fusing star often appears blue-white, and is usually stated to be white or bluish by modern observers, but earlier observers often described Beta Librae as the only greenish star visible to the naked eye. 10 There seems to be no generally accepted explanation for why some observers see it as green.  The small periodic variations in the magnitude of the Beta Librae suggests the presence of a companion star which is not directly observable from Earth. 11 However, it is categorized as a single star. 12  History  According to Eratosthenes Beta Librae was observed to be brighter than Antares . Ptolemy , 350 years later, said it was as bright as Antares. The discrepancy may be due to Antares becoming brighter, but this is not known for certain. It could simply be caused by Beta Librae being a variable star , showing a present day variability of 0.03 of a magnitude. 13  See also   List of stars in Libra  Beta Librae in fiction  Zubenelgenubi   References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 9.8\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 14  15  16  17  18  }}  External links    – Find more Arabic Star Names and their meanings.
