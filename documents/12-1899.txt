   Vectorial addition chain      Vectorial addition chain   In mathematics, for positive integers k and s , a vectorial addition chain is a sequence V of k -dimensional vectors of nonnegative integers v i for − k + 1 ≤ i ≤ s together with a sequence w , such that   v -k+1 = [1,0,0,,...0,0]  v -k+2 = [0,1,0,,...0,0]   .  .      v 0 = [0,0,0,,...0,1]  v i = v j + v r for all 1≤i≤s with -k+1≤j,r≤i-1  v s = [ n 0 ,..., n k-1 ]  w = ( w 1 ,... w s ), w i =(j,r).   For example, a vectorial addition chain for [22,18,3] is   V =([1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1],[1,1,0],[2,2,0],[4,4,0],[5,4,0],[10,8,0],[11,9,0],[11,9,1],[22,18,2],[22,18,3])  w =((-2,-1),(1,1),(2,2),(-2,3),(4,4),(1,5),(0,6),(7,7),(0,8))   Vectorial addition chains are well suited to perform multi- exponentiation :   Input : Elements x 0 ,..., x k-1 of an abelian group  G and a vectorial addition chain of dimension k computing [ n 0 ,..., n k-1 ]  Output :The element x 0 n 0 ... x k-1 n r-1   for  i = -k +1 to 0 do  y i    ←   normal-←   \leftarrow    x i+k-1  for  i = 1 to  s  do  y i    ←   normal-←   \leftarrow    y j × y r  return  y s     Addition sequence  An addition sequence for the set of integer S ={n 0 , ...,n r-1 } is an addition chain  v that contains every element of S .  For example, an addition sequence computing   {47,117,343,499}   is   (1,2,4,8,10,11,18,36, 47 ,55,91,109, 117 ,226, 343 ,434,489, 499 ).   It's possible to find addition sequence from vectorial addition chains and vice versa, so they are in a sense dual. 1  See also   Addition chain  Addition-chain exponentiation  Exponentiation by squaring  Non-adjacent form   References  "  Category:Addition chains     Cohen, H., Frey, G.
