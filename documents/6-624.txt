Daniel Goldston

Daniel Alan Goldston (born January 4, 1954 in Oakland, California) is an American mathematician who specializes in number theory. He is currently a professor of mathematics at San Jose State University.
Goldston is best known for the following result that he, János Pintz, and Cem Yıldırım proved in 2005:1



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the nth prime number. In other words, for every 
 
 
 
 , there exist infinitely many pairs of consecutive primes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which are closer to each other than the average distance between consecutive primes by a factor of 
 
 
 
 , i.e., $p_{n+1}-p_n.
 
 This result was originally reported in 2003 by Goldston and Yıldırım but was later retracted.http://aimath.org/primegaps/http://www.aimath.org/primegaps/residueerror/ Then Pintz joined the team and they completed the proof in 2005.
 
 In fact, if they assume the [[Elliott–Halberstam conjecture]], then they can also show that primes within 16 of each other occur infinitely often, which is related to the [[Twin prime|twin prime conjecture]].
