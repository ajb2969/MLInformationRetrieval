   Phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine N-methyltransferase      Phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + phosphatidyl-N-dimethylethanolamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and phosphatidyl-N-dimethylethanolamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine N-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine methyltransferase , methyltransferase II , phospholipid methyltransferase , PLMT , phosphatidyl-N-methylethanolamine methyltransferase , phosphatidyl-N-monomethylethanolamine methyltransferase , phosphatidylethanolamine methyltransferase I , and phosphatidylmonomethylethanolamine methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycine , serine and threonine  metabolism and glycerophospholipid  metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
