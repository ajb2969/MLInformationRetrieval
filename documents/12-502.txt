   Partial word      Partial word   A partial word is a string that may contain a number of "do not know" or "do not care" symbols i.e. placeholders in the string where the symbol value is not known or not specified. More formally, a partial word is a partial function     u  :    {  0  ,  …  ,   n  -  1   }   →  A      normal-:  u   normal-→   0  normal-…    n  1    A     u:\{0,\ldots,n-1\}\rightarrow A   where   A   A   A   is some finite alphabet. If u ( k ) is not defined for some    k  ∈   {  0  ,  …  ,   n  -  1   }       k   0  normal-…    n  1      k\in\{0,\ldots,n-1\}   then the unknown element at place k in the string is called a "hole". In regular expressions (following the POSIX standard) a hole is represented by the metacharacter ".". For example, aab.ab.b is a partial word of length 8 over the alphabet A ={ a , b } in which the fourth and seventh characters are holes. 1  See also   String   References    "  Category:Combinatorics on words  Category:String (computer science)     Algorithmic Combinatorics on Words REU ↩
