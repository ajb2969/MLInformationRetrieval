Factorial moment generating function

In probability theory and statistics, the factorial moment generating function of the probability distribution of a real-valued random variable X is defined as


 
  for all complex numbers t for which this expected value exists. This is the case at least for all t on the unit circle

 
 , see characteristic function. If X is a discrete random variable taking values only in the set {0,1, ...} of non-negative integers, then 
 
 
 
  is also called probability-generating function of X and 
 
 
 
  is well-defined at least for all t on the closed unit disk

 
 .
The factorial moment generating function generates the factorial moments of the probability distribution. Provided 
 
 
 
  exists in a neighbourhood of t = 1, the nth factorial moment is given by 1


 
  where the Pochhammer symbol (x)n is the falling factorial


 
  (Many mathematicians, especially in the field of special functions, use the same notation to represent the rising factorial.)
Example
Suppose X has a Poisson distribution with expected value λ, then its factorial moment generating function is


 
  (use the definition of the exponential function) and thus we have
