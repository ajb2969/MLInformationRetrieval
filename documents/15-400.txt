The facets of all omnitruncated simplectic honeycombs are called permutahedra and can be positioned in n+1 space with integral coordinates, permutations of the whole numbers (0,1,..,n).

  lattice
The A
 
 
 
  lattice (also called A
 
 
 
 ) is the union of nine A8 lattices, and has the vertex arrangement of the dual honeycomb to the omnitruncated 8-simplex honeycomb, and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is an omnitruncated 8-simplex
