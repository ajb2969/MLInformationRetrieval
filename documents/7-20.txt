Transcritical bifurcation

In bifurcation theory, a field within mathematics, a transcritical bifurcation is a particular kind of local bifurcation, meaning that it is characterized by an equilibrium having an eigenvalue whose real part passes through zero.  A transcritical bifurcation is one in which a fixed point exists for all values of a parameter and is never destroyed. However, such a fixed point interchanges its stability with another fixed point as the parameter is varied.1 In other words, both before and after the bifurcation, there is one unstable and one stable fixed point. However, their stability is exchanged when they collide. So the unstable fixed point becomes stable and vice versa.
The normal form of a transcritical bifurcation is



This equation is similar to the logistic equation but in this case we allow 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to be positive or negative (while in the logistic equation 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  must be non-negative). The two fixed points are at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . When the parameter 
 
 
 
  is negative, the fixed point at 
 
 
 
  is stable and the fixed point 
 
 
 
  is unstable. But for 
 
 
 
 , the point at 
 
 
 
  is unstable and the point at 
 
 
 
  is stable. So the bifurcation occurs at 
 
 
 
 .
A typical example (in real life) could be the consumer-producer problem where the consumption is proportional to the (quantity of) resource.
For example:


 
  where



 
  is the logistic equation of resource growth; and


 
  is the consumption, proportional to the resource 
 
 
 
 .
