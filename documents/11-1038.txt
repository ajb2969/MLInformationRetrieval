Thiamine-phosphate diphosphorylase




Thiamine-phosphate diphosphorylase

In enzymology, a thiamine-phosphate diphosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine diphosphate + 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphono-oxyethyl)thiazole 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + thiamine phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine diphosphate and 4-methyl-5-(2-phosphono-oxyethyl)thiazole, whereas its two products are diphosphate and thiamine phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-methyl-4-amino-5-hydroxymethylpyrimidine-diphosphate:4-methyl-5-(2 -phosphoethyl)thiazole 2-methyl-4-aminopyrimidine-5-methenyltransferase. Other names in common use include thiamine phosphate pyrophosphorylase, thiamine monophosphate pyrophosphorylase, and TMP-PPase. This enzyme participates in thiamine metabolism.
