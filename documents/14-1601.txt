   Percobaltate      Percobaltate   Percobaltates are chemical compounds where the oxidation state of cobalt is +5, which is highest known oxidation state of cobalt. Its general formula is . Impure sodium percobaltate can be produced by the reaction of cobalt(II,III) oxide and sodium oxide ; the oxidant is dioxygen:        4   Co  3    O  4    +   18  N   a  2   O   +   7   O  2     →   12  N   a  3    CoO  4       normal-→      4   subscript  Co  3    subscript  normal-O  4      18  normal-N   subscript  normal-a  2   normal-O     7   subscript  normal-O  2       12  normal-N   subscript  normal-a  3    subscript  CoO  4      \rm\ 4Co_{3}O_{4}+18Na_{2}O+7O_{2}\rightarrow 12Na_{3}CoO_{4}     The potassium salt can be synthesized similarly. Its magnetic moment has indicated the existence of cobalt(V). 1  See also   Caesium hexafluorocobaltate(IV)   References  "  Category:Salts  Category:Cobalt compounds     ↩
