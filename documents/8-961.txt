   Weight (strings)      Weight (strings)   The   a   a   a   - weight of a string, for   a   a   a   a letter, is the number of times that letter occurs in the string. More precisely, let   A   A   A   be a finite set (called the alphabet ),    a  ‚àà  A      a  A    a\in A   a letter of   A   A   A   , and    c  ‚àà   A  *       c   superscript  A      c\in A^{*}   a string (where    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   is the free monoid generated by the elements of   A   A   A   , equivalently the set of strings, including the empty string, whose letters are from   A   A   A   ). Then the   a   a   a   - weight of   c   c   c   , denoted by     wt  a    (  c  )        subscript  wt  a   c    \mathrm{wt}_{a}(c)   , is the number of times the generator   a   a   a   occurs in the unique expression for   c   c   c   as a product (concatenation) of letters in   A   A   A   .  If   A   A   A   is an abelian group , the Hamming weight     wt   (  c  )       wt  c    \mathrm{wt}(c)   of   c   c   c   , often simply referred to as "weight", is the number of nonzero letters in   c   c   c   .  Examples   Let    A  =   {  x  ,  y  ,  z  }       A   x  y  z     A=\{x,y,z\}   . In the string    c  =   y  x  x  z  y  y  z  x  y  z  z  y  x       c    y  x  x  z  y  y  z  x  y  z  z  y  x     c=yxxzyyzxyzzyx   ,   y   y   y   occurs 5 times, so the   y   y   y   -weight of   c   c   c   is      wt  y    (  c  )    =  5         subscript  wt  y   c   5    \mathrm{wt}_{y}(c)=5   .  Let    A  =   ùêô  3   =   {  0  ,  1  ,  2  }         A   subscript  ùêô  3         0  1  2      A=\mathbf{Z}_{3}=\{0,1,2\}   (an abelian group) and    c  =  002001200      c  002001200    c=002001200   . Then      wt  0    (  c  )    =  6         subscript  wt  0   c   6    \mathrm{wt}_{0}(c)=6   ,      wt  1    (  c  )    =  1         subscript  wt  1   c   1    \mathrm{wt}_{1}(c)=1   ,      wt  2    (  c  )    =  2         subscript  wt  2   c   2    \mathrm{wt}_{2}(c)=2   and     wt   (  c  )    =     wt  1    (  c  )    +    wt  2    (  c  )     =  3          wt  c        subscript  wt  1   c      subscript  wt  2   c         3     \mathrm{wt}(c)=\mathrm{wt}_{1}(c)+\mathrm{wt}_{2}(c)=3   .
