Weight (strings)

The 
 
 
 
 -weight of a string, for 
 
 
 
  a letter, is the number of times that letter occurs in the string. More precisely, let 
 
 
 
  be a finite set (called the alphabet), 
 
 
 
 
  a letter of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  a string (where 
 
 
 
  is the free monoid generated by the elements of 
 
 
 
 , equivalently the set of strings, including the empty string, whose letters are from 
 
 
 
 
 ). Then the 
 
 
 
 -weight of 
 
 
 
 , denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is the number of times the generator 
 
 
 
  occurs in the unique expression for 
 
 
 
 
  as a product (concatenation) of letters in 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is an abelian group, the Hamming weight

 
  of 
 
 
 
 , often simply referred to as "weight", is the number of nonzero letters in 
 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

Let 
 
 
 
 . In the string 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  occurs 5 times, so the 
 
 
 
 -weight of 
 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  (an abelian group) and 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and
