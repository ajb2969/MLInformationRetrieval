== Summary == A diagram of the spectral response of a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG). The reflected power, 
 
 
 
 , is shown as a function of the wavelength, 
 
 
 
 . The central wavelength, 
 
 
 
 , is called the Bragg wavelength. The spacing between the first two minima, 
 
 
 
 , is the bandwidth. The peak reflected power 
 
 
 
 , at the Bragg wavelength is also shown. The secondary peaks are referred to as side lobes.
