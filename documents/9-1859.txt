   File:Fbg2.GIF      File:Fbg2.GIF   == Summary == A diagram of the spectral response of a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG). The reflected power,     P  B    (  λ  )        subscript  P  B   λ    P_{B}(\lambda)   , is shown as a function of the wavelength,   λ   λ   \lambda   . The central wavelength,    λ  B     subscript  λ  B    \lambda_{B}   , is called the Bragg wavelength. The spacing between the first two minima,    Δ   λ  B       normal-Δ   subscript  λ  B     \Delta\lambda_{B}   , is the bandwidth. The peak reflected power     P  B    (   λ  B   )        subscript  P  B    subscript  λ  B     P_{B}(\lambda_{B})   , at the Bragg wavelength is also shown. The secondary peaks are referred to as side lobes.  Licensing  Uploader drew the image  "
