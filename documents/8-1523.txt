Levinson's inequality

In mathematics, '''Levinson's inequality ''' is the following inequality, due to Norman Levinson, involving positive numbers. Let 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a given function having a third derivative on the range 
 
 
 
 , and such that



for all 
 
 
 
 . Suppose 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

The Ky Fan inequality is the special case of Levinson's inequality where
$$p_i=1,\  a=\frac{1}{2},$$
and
$$f(x)=\log x. \,$$
