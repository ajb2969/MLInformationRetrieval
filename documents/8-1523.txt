   Levinson's inequality      Levinson's inequality   In mathematics , '''Levinson's inequality ''' is the following inequality, due to Norman Levinson , involving positive numbers. Let    a  >  0      a  0    a>0   and let   f   f   f   be a given function having a third derivative on the range    (  0  ,   2  a   )     0    2  a     (0,2a)   , and such that        f  ′′′    (  x  )    ≥  0         superscript  f  ′′′   x   0    f^{\prime\prime\prime}(x)\geq 0     for all    x  ∈   (  0  ,   2  a   )       x   0    2  a      x\in(0,2a)   . Suppose       p  i   =  1   ,   a  =   1  2     ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  p  i   1     a    1  2      p_{i}=1,\ a=\frac{1}{2},   and      f   (  x  )    =   log  x    .        f  x     x     f(x)=\log x.\,     The Ky Fan inequality is the special case of Levinson's inequality where  $$p_i=1,\  a=\frac{1}{2},$$  and  $$f(x)=\log x. \,$$  References   Scott Lawrence and Daniel Segalman: A generalization of two inequalities involving means , Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society.
