Abel's irreducibility theorem
In mathematics, '''Abel's irreducibility theorem''', a [[field theory (mathematics)|field theory]] result described in 1829 by [[Niels Henrik Abel]],{{citation|last=Abel|first=N. H.|authorlink=Niels Henrik Abel|title=Mémoire sur une classe particulière d'équations résolubles algébriquement|trans_title=Note on a particular class of algebraically solvable equations|journal=[[Crelle's Journal|Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik]]|volume=4|pages=131–156|year=1829|doi=10.1515/crll.1829.4.131}}. asserts that if ''ƒ''(''x'') is a [[polynomial]] over a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''F'' that shares a root with a polynomial ''g''(''x'') that is  [[irreducible polynomial|irre
 ducible]] over F, then every root of g(x) is a root of ƒ(x). Equivalently, if ƒ(x) shares at least one root with g(x) then ƒ is divisible evenly by g(x), meaning that ƒ(x) can be factored as g(x)h(x) with h(x) also having coefficients in F.12
Corollaries of the theorem include:3

If ƒ(x) is irreducible, there is no lower-degree polynomial (other than the zero polynomial) that shares any root with it. For example, x2 − 2 is irreducible over the rational numbers and has 
 
 
 
  as a root; hence there is no linear or constant polynomial over the rationals having 
 
 
 
  as a root. Furthermore, there is no same-degree polynomial that shares any roots with ƒ(x), other than constant multiples of ƒ(x).
If ƒ(x) ≠ g(x) are two different irreducible monic polynomials, then they share no roots.

This theorem, for minimal polynomials rather than irreducible polynomials more generally, is Lemma 4.1.3 of . Irreducible polynomials, divided by their leading coefficient, are minimal for their roots (Cox Proposition 4.1.5), and all minimal polynomials are irreducible, so Cox's formulation is equivalent to Abel's. .
