   Hartree      Hartree   The hartree (symbol: E h or Ha ), also known as the Hartree energy , is the atomic unit of energy , named after the British  physicist  Douglas Hartree . It is defined as 2 R ∞ hc , where R ∞ is the Rydberg constant , h is the Planck constant and c is the speed of light . The 2010 CODATA recommended value is E h =  = . 1 The 2006 CODATA recommended value was E h =  = .  The hartree energy is approximately the electric potential energy of the hydrogen  atom in its ground state and, by the virial theorem , approximately twice its ionization energy ; the relationships are not exact because of the finite mass of the nucleus of the hydrogen atom and relativistic corrections .  The hartree is usually used as a unit of energy in atomic physics and computational chemistry : for experimental measurements at the atomic scale, the electronvolt (eV) or the reciprocal centimetre (cm −1 ) are much more widely used.
