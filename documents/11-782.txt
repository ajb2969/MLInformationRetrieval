   Pterin deaminase      Pterin deaminase   In enzymology , a pterin deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,4-dihydroxypteridine + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2,4-dihydroxypteridine and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-amino-4-hydroxypteridine aminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called acrasinase .
