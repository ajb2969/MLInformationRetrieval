   Overfull graph      Overfull graph   In graph theory , an overfull graph is a graph whose size is greater than the product of its maximum degree and half of its order  floored , i.e.     |  E  |   >   Δ   (  G  )    ⌊    |  V  |   /  2   ⌋          E     normal-Δ  G        V   2       |E|>\Delta(G)\lfloor|V|/2\rfloor   where    |  E  |      E    |E|   is the size of G ,    Δ   (  G  )       normal-Δ  G    \displaystyle\Delta(G)   is the maximum degree of G , and    |  V  |      V    |V|   is the order of G . The concept of an overfull subgraph , an overfull graph that is a subgraph , immediately follows. An alternate, stricter definition of an overfull subgraph S of a graph G requires     Δ   (  G  )    =   Δ   (  S  )          normal-Δ  G     normal-Δ  S     \displaystyle\Delta(G)=\Delta(S)   .  Properties  A few properties of overfull graphs:   Overfull graphs are of odd order.  Overfull graphs are class 2 . That is, they require at least    Δ  +  1      normal-Δ  1    Δ+1   colors in any edge coloring .  A graph G , with an overfull subgraph S such that     Δ   (  G  )    =   Δ   (  S  )          normal-Δ  G     normal-Δ  S     \displaystyle\Delta(G)=\Delta(S)   , is of class 2.   Overfull conjecture  In 1986, Chetwynd and Hilton posited the following conjecture that is now known as the overfull conjecture . 1   A graph G with     Δ   (  G  )    ≥   n  /  3         normal-Δ  G     n  3     \Delta(G)\geq n/3   is class 2 if and only if it has an overfull subgraph S such that     Δ   (  G  )    =   Δ   (  S  )          normal-Δ  G     normal-Δ  S     \displaystyle\Delta(G)=\Delta(S)   .   This conjecture, if true, would have numerous implications in graph theory, including the 1-factorization conjecture . 2  Algorithms  For graphs in which    Δ  ≥   n  3       normal-Δ    n  3     \Delta\geq\frac{n}{3}   , there are at most three induced overfull subgraphs, and it is possible to find an overfull subgraph in polynomial time . When    Δ  ≥   n  2       normal-Δ    n  2     \Delta\geq\frac{n}{2}   , there is at most one induced overfull subgraph, and it is possible to find it in linear time. 3  References  "  Category:Graph families     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
