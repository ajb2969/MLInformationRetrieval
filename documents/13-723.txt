Overfull graph

In graph theory, an overfull graph is a graph whose size is greater than the product of its maximum degree and half of its order floored, i.e. 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the size of G, 
 
 
 
 
  is the maximum degree of G, and 
 
 
 
  is the order of G. The concept of an overfull subgraph, an overfull graph that is a subgraph, immediately follows. An alternate, stricter definition of an overfull subgraph S of a graph G requires 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
A few properties of overfull graphs:

Overfull graphs are of odd order.
Overfull graphs are class 2. That is, they require at least 
 
 
 
  colors in any edge coloring.
A graph G, with an overfull subgraph S such that 
 
 
 
 , is of class 2.

Overfull conjecture
In 1986, Chetwynd and Hilton posited the following conjecture that is now known as the overfull conjecture.1

A graph G with 
 
 
 
 
  is class 2 if and only if it has an overfull subgraph S such that 
 
 
 
 .
 

This conjecture, if true, would have numerous implications in graph theory, including the 1-factorization conjecture.2
Algorithms
For graphs in which 
 
 
 
 , there are at most three induced overfull subgraphs, and it is possible to find an overfull subgraph in polynomial time. When 
 
 
 
 , there is at most one induced overfull subgraph, and it is possible to find it in linear time.3
