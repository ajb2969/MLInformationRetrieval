Derrick's theorem

Derrick's theorem is an argument due to a physicist G.H. Derrick which shows that stationary localized solutions to a nonlinear wave equation or nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation in spatial dimensions three and higher are unstable.
Original argument
Derrick's paper,1 which was considered an obstacle to interpreting soliton-like solutions as particles, contained the following physical argument about non-existence of stable localized stationary solutions to the nonlinear wave equation


 
 , now known under the name of Derrick's Theorem. (Above, 
 
 
 
  is a differentiable function with 
 
 
 
 .)
The energy of the time-independent solution 
 
 
 
  is given by



A necessary condition for the solution to be stable is 
 
 
 
 . Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a localized solution of 
 
 
 
 . Define 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary constant, and write 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . Then


 
  Whence 
 
 
 
 , and since 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  That is, 
 
 
 
  for a variation corresponding to a uniform stretching of the particle. Hence the solution 
 
 
 
  is unstable.
The above argument also works for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
Pohozaev's identity
More generally,2 let 
 
 
 
  be continuous, with 
 
 
 
 . Denote 
 
 
 
 . Let


 
  be a solution to the equation


 
 , in the sense of distributions. Then 
 
 
 
  satisfies the relation


 
  known as Pohozaev's identity.3 It result is similar to the Virial theorem.
Interpretation in the Hamiltonian form
We may write the equation 
 
 
 
  in the Hamiltonian form

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  are functions of 
 
 
 
 , the Hamilton function is given by


 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are the variational derivatives of 
 
 
 
 .
Then the stationary solution 
 
 
 
  has the energy 
 
 
 
  and satisfies the equation


 
  with 
 
 
 
  denoting a variational derivative of the functional

 
 . Although the solution 
 
 
 
  is a critical point of 
 
 
 
  (since 
 
 
 
 ), Derrick's argument shows that 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 , hence 
 
 
 
  is not a point of the local minimum of the energy functional 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, physically, the solution 
 
 
 
  is expected to be unstable.
Stability of localized time-periodic solutions
Derrick describes some possible ways out of this difficulty, including the conjecture that Elementary particles might correspond to stable, localized solutions which are periodic in time, rather than time-independent. Indeed, it was later shown4 that a time-periodic solitary wave

 
  with frequency 
 
 
 
  may be orbitally stable if the Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion is satisfied.
