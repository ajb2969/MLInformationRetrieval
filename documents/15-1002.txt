   Wave maps equation      Wave maps equation   In mathematical physics, the wave maps equation is        D  α     ∂  α   u    =   0          superscript  D  α     subscript   α   u    0    D^{\alpha}\partial_{\alpha}u=0\,     where   D   D   D   is a connection . 1 2  It can be considered, in some ways a natural extension of the wave equation for Riemannian manifolds . 3  References  "  Category:Equations     ↩  ↩  http://www.math.ucla.edu/~tao/preprints/wavemaps.pdf ↩
