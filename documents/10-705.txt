General matrix notation of a VAR(p)

This page shows the details for different matrix notations of a vector autoregression process with k variables.
Var(p)


 
  Where each 
 
 
 
  is a vector of length k and each 
 
 
 
  is a k × k matrix.
Large matrix notation



Equation by regression notation
Rewriting the y variables one to one gives:






Concise matrix notation
One can rewrite a VAR(p) with k variables in a general way which includes T+1 observations 
 
 
 
  through 
 
 




Where:









and



One can then solve for the coefficient matrix B (e.g. using an ordinary least squares estimation of 
 
 
 
 )
