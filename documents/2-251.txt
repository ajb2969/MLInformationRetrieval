Liouville function

The Liouville function, denoted by λ(n) and named after Joseph Liouville, is an important function in number theory.
If n is a positive integer, then λ(n) is defined as:



where Ω(n) is the number of prime factors of n, counted with multiplicity .
λ is completely multiplicative since Ω(n) is completely additive, i.e.: Ω(ab) = Ω(a) + Ω(b). The number one has no prime factors, so Ω(1) = 0 and therefore λ(1) = 1. The Liouville function satisfies the identity:



The Liouville function's Dirichlet inverse is the absolute value of the Möbius function.
Series
The Dirichlet series for the Liouville function is related to the Riemann zeta function by



The Lambert series for the Liouville function is



where 
 
 
 
  is the Jacobi theta function.
Conjectures

 

The Pólya conjecture is a conjecture made by George Pólya in 1919. Defining



the conjecture states that 
 
 
 
  for n > 1. This turned out to be false. The smallest counter-example is n = 906150257, found by Minoru Tanaka in 1980. It has since been shown that L(n) > 0.0618672√n for infinitely many positive integers n,1 while it can also be shown that L(n) T(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\lambda(k)}{k}.
It was open for some time whether T(n) ≥ 0 for sufficiently big n ≥ n0 (this "conjecture" is occasionally (but incorrectly) attributed to Pál Turán). This was then disproved by Haselgrove in 1958 (see the reference below), who showed that T(n) takes negative values infinitely often. A confirmation of this positivity conjecture would have led to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis, as was shown by Pál Turán.
