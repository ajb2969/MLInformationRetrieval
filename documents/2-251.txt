   Liouville function      Liouville function   The Liouville function , denoted by λ( n ) and named after Joseph Liouville , is an important function in number theory .  If n is a positive integer , then λ( n ) is defined as:        λ   (  n  )    =    (   -  1   )    Ω   (  n  )      ,        λ  n    superscript    1     normal-Ω  n      \lambda(n)=(-1)^{\Omega(n)},\,\!     where Ω( n ) is the number of prime  factors of n , counted with multiplicity .  λ is completely multiplicative since Ω( n ) is completely additive , i.e.: Ω( ab ) = Ω( a ) + Ω( b ). The number one has no prime factors, so Ω(1) = 0 and therefore λ(1) = 1. The Liouville function satisfies the identity :        ∑   d  |  n     λ   (  d  )     =   {     1     if  n  is a perfect square,       0    otherwise.            subscript    fragments  d  normal-|  n      λ  d     cases  1    if  n  is a perfect square,   0  otherwise.     \sum_{d|n}\lambda(d)=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }n\text{ is a perfect square,}\\
 0&\text{otherwise.}\end{cases}     The Liouville function's Dirichlet inverse is the absolute value of the Möbius function .  Series  The Dirichlet series for the Liouville function is related to the Riemann zeta function by         ζ   (   2  s   )     ζ   (  s  )     =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     λ   (  n  )     n  s      .          ζ    2  s      ζ  s      superscript   subscript     n  1          λ  n    superscript  n  s       \frac{\zeta(2s)}{\zeta(s)}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\lambda(n)}{n^{s}}.     The Lambert series for the Liouville function is         ∑   n  =  1   ∞     λ   (  n  )    q  n     1  -   q  n      =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    q   n  2     =    1  2    (     ϑ  3    (  q  )    -  1   )     ,          superscript   subscript     n  1          λ  n   superscript  q  n      1   superscript  q  n        superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript  q   superscript  n  2              1  2        subscript  ϑ  3   q   1       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{\lambda(n)q^{n}}{1-q^{n}}=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}q^{n^{2}%
 }=\frac{1}{2}\left(\vartheta_{3}(q)-1\right),     where     ϑ  3    (  q  )        subscript  ϑ  3   q    \vartheta_{3}(q)   is the Jacobi theta function .  Conjectures      The Pólya conjecture is a conjecture made by George Pólya in 1919. Defining        L   (  n  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   n    λ   (  k  )      ,        L  n     superscript   subscript     k  1    n     λ  k      L(n)=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\lambda(k),     the conjecture states that     L   (  n  )    ≤  0        L  n   0    L(n)\leq 0   for n > 1. This turned out to be false. The smallest counter-example is n = 906150257, found by Minoru Tanaka in 1980. It has since been shown that L ( n ) > 0.0618672√ n for infinitely many positive integers n , 1 while it can also be shown that L ( n ) T(n) = \sum_{k=1}^n \frac{\lambda(k)}{k}.  It was open for some time whether T ( n ) ≥ 0 for sufficiently big n ≥ n 0 (this "conjecture" is occasionally (but incorrectly) attributed to Pál Turán ). This was then disproved by Haselgrove in 1958 (see the reference below), who showed that T ( n ) takes negative values infinitely often. A confirmation of this positivity conjecture would have led to a proof of the Riemann hypothesis , as was shown by Pál Turán.  References          "  Category:Multiplicative functions     P.
