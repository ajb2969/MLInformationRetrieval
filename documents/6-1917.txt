   Prime decomposition (3-manifold)      Prime decomposition (3-manifold)   In mathematics , the prime decomposition theorem for 3-manifolds states that every compact , orientable  3-manifold is the connected sum of a unique ( up to  homeomorphism ) collection of prime 3-manifolds .  A manifold is prime if it cannot be presented as a connected sum of more than one manifold, none of which is the sphere of the same dimension. This condition is necessary since for any manifold M of dimension   n   n   n   it is true that       M  =   M  #   S  n     .      M    M  normal-#   superscript  S  n      M=M\#S^{n}.     (where M#S n means the connected sum of M and S n ). If P is a prime 3-manifold then either it is S 2 × S 1 or the non-orientable S 2  bundle over S 1 , or it is irreducible , which means that any embedded 2-sphere bounds a ball. So the theorem can be restated to say that there is a unique connected sum decomposition into irreducible 3-manifolds and fiber bundles of S 2 over S 1 .  The prime decomposition holds also for non-orientable 3-manifolds, but the uniqueness statement must be modified slightly: every compact, non-orientable 3-manifold is a connected sum of irreducible 3-manifolds and non-orientable S 2  bundles over S 1 . This sum is unique as long as we specify that each summand is either irreducible or a non-orientable S 2  bundle over S 1 .  The proof is based on normal surface techniques originated by Hellmuth Kneser . Existence was proven by Kneser, but the exact formulation and proof of the uniqueness was done more than 30 years later by John Milnor .  References   J.
