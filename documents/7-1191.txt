   Relevance vector machine      Relevance vector machine   In mathematics , a relevance vector machine (RVM) is a machine learning technique that uses Bayesian inference to obtain parsimonious solutions for regression and probabilistic classification . 1 The RVM has an identical functional form to the support vector machine , but provides probabilistic classification.  It is actually equivalent to a Gaussian process model with covariance function :       k   (  𝐱  ,   𝐱  ′   )    =    ∑   j  =  1   N     1   α  j    φ   (  𝐱  ,   𝐱  j   )   φ   (   𝐱  ′   ,   𝐱  j   )           k   𝐱   superscript  𝐱  normal-′       superscript   subscript     j  1    N       1   subscript  α  j    φ   𝐱   subscript  𝐱  j    φ    superscript  𝐱  normal-′    subscript  𝐱  j        k(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{x^{\prime}})=\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{1}{\alpha_{j}}\varphi(%
 \mathbf{x},\mathbf{x}_{j})\varphi(\mathbf{x}^{\prime},\mathbf{x}_{j})   where   φ   φ   \varphi   is the kernel function (usually Gaussian),    α  j     subscript  α  j    \alpha_{j}   's as the variances of the prior on the weight vector    w  ∼   N   (  0  ,    α   -  1    I   )       similar-to  w    N   0     superscript  α    1    I       w\sim N(0,\alpha^{-1}I)   ,and     𝐱  1   ,  …  ,   𝐱  N       subscript  𝐱  1   normal-…   subscript  𝐱  N     \mathbf{x}_{1},\ldots,\mathbf{x}_{N}   are the input vectors of the training set .  Compared to that of support vector machines (SVM), the Bayesian formulation of the RVM avoids the set of free parameters of the SVM (that usually require cross-validation-based post-optimizations). However RVMs use an expectation maximization (EM)-like learning method and are therefore at risk of local minima. This is unlike the standard sequential minimal optimization (SMO)-based algorithms employed by SVMs , which are guaranteed to find a global optimum (of the convex problem).
