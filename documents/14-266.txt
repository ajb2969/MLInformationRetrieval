   Permutation representation (disambiguation)      Permutation representation (disambiguation)   In mathematics , a permutation representation of a (typically finite) group    G   G   G   can refer to two closely related notions: a representation of   G   G   G   as a group of permutations , or as a group of permutation matrices .  Abstract permutation representation  A permutation representation of a group    G   G   G   on a set    X   X   X   is a homomorphism from   G   G   G   to the symmetric group of   X   X   X   :       ρ  :   G  →   Sym   (  X  )      .     normal-:  ρ   normal-→  G   Sym  X      \rho\colon G\to\operatorname{Sym}(X).   The image    ρ   (  G  )    \sub    Sym   (  X  )        ρ  G  \sub   Sym  X     \rho(G)\sub\operatorname{Sym}(X)   is a permutation group and the elements of   G   G   G   are represented as permutations of   X   X   X   . A permutation representation is equivalent to an action of   G   G   G   on the set   X   X   X   :        G  ×  X   →  X   .     normal-→    G  X   X    G\times X\to X.   See the article on group action for further details.  Linear permutation representation  If   G   G   G   is a permutation group of degree   n   n   n   , then the permutation representation of   G   G   G   is the linear representation of   G   G   G         ρ  :   G  →    GL  n    (  K  )        normal-:  ρ   normal-→  G    subscript  GL  n   K      \rho\colon G\to\operatorname{GL}_{n}(K)   which maps    g  ∈  G      g  G    g\in G   to the corresponding permutation matrix (Here   K   K   K   is an arbitrary field ). That is,   G   G   G   acts on    K  n     superscript  K  n    K^{n}   by permuting the standard basis vectors.  This notion of a permutation representation can, of course, be composed with the previous one to represent an arbitrary abstract group   G   G   G   as a group of permutation matrices. One first represents   G   G   G   as a permutation group and then maps each permutation to the corresponding matrix.  "
