Permutation representation (disambiguation)

In mathematics, a permutation representation of a (typically finite) group

 
  can refer to two closely related notions: a representation of 
 
 
 
  as a group of permutations, or as a group of permutation matrices.
Abstract permutation representation
A permutation representation of a group

 
  on a set

 
  is a homomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to the symmetric group of 
 
 
 
 :


 
  The image 
 
 
 
  is a permutation group and the elements of 
 
 
 
  are represented as permutations of 
 
 
 
 . A permutation representation is equivalent to an action of 
 
 
 
  on the set 
 
 
 
 :


 
  See the article on group action for further details.
Linear permutation representation
If 
 
 
 
  is a permutation group of degree 
 
 
 
 , then the permutation representation of 
 
 
 
  is the linear representation of 
 
 



 
  which maps 
 
 
 
  to the corresponding permutation matrix (Here 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary field). That is, 
 
 
 
  acts on 
 
 
 
  by permuting the standard basis vectors.
This notion of a permutation representation can, of course, be composed with the previous one to represent an arbitrary abstract group 
 
 
 
  as a group of permutation matrices. One first represents 
 
 
 
  as a permutation group and then maps each permutation to the corresponding matrix.
