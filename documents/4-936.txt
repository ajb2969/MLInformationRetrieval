Reflective caustic generated from a circle and parallel rays

In differential geometry and geometric optics, a caustic is the envelope of rays either reflected or refracted by a manifold. It is related to the concept of caustics in optics. The ray's source may be a point (called the radiant) or parallel rays from a point at infinity, in which case a direction vector of the rays must be specified.
More generally, especially as applied to symplectic geometry and singularity theory, a caustic is the critical value set of a Lagrangian mapping  where  is a Lagrangian immersion of a Lagrangian submanifold L into a symplectic manifold M, and  is a Lagrangian fibration of the symplectic manifold M. The caustic is a subset of the Lagrangian fibration's base space B.1
Catacaustic
A catacaustic is the reflective case.
With a radiant, it is the evolute of the orthotomic of the radiant.
The planar, parallel-source-rays case: suppose the direction vector is 
 
 
 
  and the mirror curve is parametrised as 
 
 
 
 . The normal vector at a point is 
 
 
 
 ; the reflection of the direction vector is (normal needs special normalization)


 
  Having components of found reflected vector treat it as a tangent


 
  Using the simplest envelope form






 
  which may be unaesthetic, but 
 
 
 
  gives a linear system in 
 
 
 
  and so it is elementary to obtain a parametrisation of the catacaustic. Cramer's rule would serve.
Example
Let the direction vector be (0,1) and the mirror be 
 
 
 
  Then


 
    
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
    
 
 
 
    
 
 






 
  and 
 
 
 
  has solution 
 
 
 
 ; i.e., light entering a parabolic mirror parallel to its axis is reflected through the focus.
