Lactoyl-CoA dehydratase




Lactoyl-CoA dehydratase

In enzymology, a lactoyl-CoA dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

lactoyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  acryloyl-CoA + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, lactoyl-CoA, and two products, acryloyl-CoA and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is lactoyl-CoA hydro-lyase (acryloyl-CoA-forming). Other names in common use include lactoyl coenzyme A dehydratase, lactyl-coenzyme A dehydrase, lactyl CoA dehydratase, acrylyl coenzyme A hydratase, and lactoyl-CoA hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in propanoate metabolism and styrene degradation.
