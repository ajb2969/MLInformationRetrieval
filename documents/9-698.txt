This happens when all the critical points of   f   f   f   are pre-periodic. Such critical points are often called Misiurewicz points .  Spine  The most studied polynomials are probably those of the form     f   (  z  )    =    z  2   +  c         f  z      superscript  z  2   c     f(z)=z^{2}+c   , which are often denoted by    f  c     subscript  f  c    f_{c}   , where   c   c   c   is any complex number. In this case, the spine     S  c      subscript  S  c    S_{c}\,   of the filled Julia set    K    K   \ K\,   is defined as arc between    β    β   \beta\,    -fixed point and    -   β       β    -\beta\,   ,       S  c   =   [   -  β   ,  β  ]        subscript  S  c      β   β     S_{c}=\left[-\beta,\beta\right]\,     with such properties:   spine lies inside    K    K   \ K\,   . 1 This makes sense when    K    K   K\,   is connected and full 2  spine is invariant under 180 degree rotation,  spine is a finite topological tree,  Critical point      z   c  r    =   0        subscript  z    c  r    0    z_{cr}=0\,   always belongs to the spine. 3      β    β   \beta\,    -fixed point is a landing point of external ray of angle zero    ℛ  0  K     subscript   superscript  ℛ  K   0    \mathcal{R}^{K}_{0}   ,      -   β       β    -\beta\,   is landing point of external ray     ℛ   1  /  2   K     subscript   superscript  ℛ  K     1  2     \mathcal{R}^{K}_{1/2}   .
