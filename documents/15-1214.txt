8-hydroxyfuranocoumarin 8-O-methyltransferase

8-hydroxyfuranocoumarin 8-O-methyltransferase (, furanocoumarin 8-methyltransferase, furanocoumarin 8-O-methyl-transferase, xanthotoxol 8-O-methyltransferase, XMT, SAM:xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:8-hydroxyfuranocoumarin 8-O-methyltransferase, xanthotoxol methyltransferase, xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine-xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:8-hydroxyfurocoumarin 8-O-methyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + an 8-hydroxyfurocoumarin 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + an 8-methoxyfurocoumarin (general reaction)
 
(2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + xanthotoxol 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + xanthotoxin
 

8-hydroxyfuranocoumarin 8-O-methyltransferase converts xanthotoxol into xanthotoxin.
