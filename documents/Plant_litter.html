<p><strong>Litterfall</strong>, <strong>plant litter</strong>, <strong>leaf litter</strong>, <strong>tree litter</strong>, <strong>soil litter</strong>, or <strong>duff</strong>, is dead <a class="uri" href="plant" title="wikilink">plant</a> material, such as <a href="leaf" title="wikilink">leaves</a>, <a class="uri" href="bark" title="wikilink">bark</a>, <a href="Needle_(botany)" title="wikilink">needles</a>, and <a href="twig" title="wikilink">twigs</a>, that has fallen to the ground. This <a class="uri" href="detritus" title="wikilink">detritus</a> or dead organic material and its constituent nutrients are added to the top layer of soil, commonly known as the litter layer or <a href="O_horizon" title="wikilink">O horizon</a> ("O" for "organic"). Litter has occupied the attention of ecologists at length for the reasons that it is an instrumental factor in ecosystem dynamics, is indicative of ecological <a href="Productivity_(ecology)" title="wikilink">productivity</a>, and may be useful in predicting regional <a href="nutrient_cycle" title="wikilink">nutrient cycling</a> and <a href="Fertility_(soil)" title="wikilink">soil fertility</a>.</p>

</figure>

<p>Litterfall is characterized as fresh, undecomposed, and easily recognizable (by species and type) plant debris. This can be anything from leaves, cones, needles, twigs, bark, seeds/nuts, logs, or reproductive organs (e.g. the <a class="uri" href="stamen" title="wikilink">stamen</a> of flowering plants). Items larger than 2 cm diameter are referred to as <a href="coarse_woody_debris" title="wikilink">coarse litter</a>, while anything smaller is referred to as fine litter or litter. The type of litterfall is most directly affected by <a class="uri" href="ecosystem" title="wikilink">ecosystem</a> type. For example, leaf tissues account for about 70 percent of litterfall in forests, but woody litter tends to increase with forest age.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> In grasslands, there is very little aboveground <a class="uri" href="perennial" title="wikilink">perennial</a> tissue so the annual litterfall is very low and quite nearly equal to the net primary production.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>In <a href="soil_science" title="wikilink">soil science</a>, soil litter is classified in three layers, which form on the surface of the O Horizon. These are the L, F, and H layers:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> </p>

<p>The litter layer is quite variable in its thickness, decomposition rate and nutrient content and is affected in part by <a class="uri" href="seasonality" title="wikilink">seasonality</a>, plant species, climate, soil fertility, elevation, and <a class="uri" href="latitude" title="wikilink">latitude</a>. The most extreme variability of litterfall is seen as a function of seasonality; each individual species of plant has seasonal losses of certain parts of its body, which can be determined by the collection and classification of plant litterfall throughout the year, and in turn affects the thickness of the litter layer. In tropical environments, the largest amount of debris falls in the latter part of dry seasons and early during wet season.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> As a result of this variability due to seasons, the decomposition rate for any given area will also be variable.</p>

<p> Latitude also has a strong effect on litterfall rates and thickness. Specifically, litterfall declines with increasing latitude. In tropical rainforests, there is a thin litter layer due to the rapid decomposition,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> while in <a href="boreal_forests" title="wikilink">boreal forests</a>, the rate of decomposition is slower and leads to the accumulation of a thick litter layer, also known as a <a href="Humus" title="wikilink">mor</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Net primary production works inversely to this trend, suggesting that the accumulation of organic matter is mainly a result of decomposition rate.</p>

<p>Surface detritus facilitates the capture and infiltration of rainwater into lower soil layers. Soil litter protects soil aggregates from raindrop impact, preventing the release of clay and silt particles from plugging soil pores.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Releasing clay and silt particles reduces the capacity for soil to absorb water and increases cross surface flow, accelerating soil <a class="uri" href="erosion" title="wikilink">erosion</a>. In addition soil litter reduces <a href="Aeolian_processes" title="wikilink">wind erosion</a> by preventing soil from losing moisture and providing cover preventing soil transportation.</p>

<p>Organic matter accumulation also helps protect soils from <a class="uri" href="wildfire" title="wikilink">wildfire</a> damage. Soil litter can be completely removed depending on intensity and severity of wildfires and season.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> Regions will high frequency wildfires have reduced vegetation density and reduced soil litter accumulation. Climate also influences the depth of plant litter. Typically humid tropic and sub-tropic climates have reduced organic matter layers and horizons due to year round decomposition and high vegetation density and growth. In temperate and cold climates, litter tends to accuculate and decompose slower due to a shorter growing season.</p>
<h2 id="net-primary-productivity">Net primary productivity</h2>

<p>Net <a href="primary_production" title="wikilink">primary production</a> and litterfall are intimately connected. In every terrestrial ecosystem, the largest fraction of all net primary production is lost to <a class="uri" href="herbivores" title="wikilink">herbivores</a> and litterfall. Therefore these factors must be accounted for. Ecologists account for this effect by subtracting the accumulated litterfall from the net primary production, resulting in what is called the <em>true increment</em> of net primary production. Due to their interconnectedness, global patterns of litterfall are similar to global patterns of net primary productivity.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="habitat-and-food">Habitat and food</h2>

<p>Litter provides <a href="Habitat_(ecology)" title="wikilink">habitat</a> for a variety of organisms.</p>

</figure>

<p>Certain plants are specially adapted for germinating and thriving in the litter layers. For example, bluebell (<em><a href="Hyacinthoides_non-scripta" title="wikilink">Hyacinthoides non-scripta</a></em>) shoots puncture the layer to emerge in spring. Some plants with <a href="rhizome" title="wikilink">rhizomes</a>, such as common wood sorrel (<em><a href="Oxalis_acetosella" title="wikilink">Oxalis acetosella</a></em>) do well in this habitat.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="detritivores-and-other-decomposers">Detritivores and other decomposers</h3>

<p>Many organisms that live on the forest floor are <a class="uri" href="decomposers" title="wikilink">decomposers</a>, such as <a class="uri" href="fungi" title="wikilink">fungi</a>. Organisms whose diet consists of plant detritus, such as <a href="earthworm" title="wikilink">earthworms</a>, are termed <a href="detritivore" title="wikilink">detritivores</a>. The community of decomposers in the litter layer also includes <a class="uri" href="bacteria" title="wikilink">bacteria</a>, <a class="uri" href="amoeba" title="wikilink">amoeba</a>, <a href="nematode" title="wikilink">nematodes</a>, <a class="uri" href="rotifer" title="wikilink">rotifer</a>, <a href="springtail" title="wikilink">springtails</a>, <a class="uri" href="cryptostigmata" title="wikilink">cryptostigmata</a>, <a href="Enchytraeidae" title="wikilink">potworms</a>, insect <a href="larva" title="wikilink">larvae</a>, <a href="Mollusca" title="wikilink">mollusks</a>, <a href="Oribatida" title="wikilink">oribatid mites</a>, <a href="woodlouse" title="wikilink">woodlice</a>, and <a href="millipede" title="wikilink">millipedes</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Their consumption of the litterfall results in the breakdown of simple carbon compounds into <a href="carbon_dioxide" title="wikilink">carbon dioxide</a> (CO<sub>2</sub>) and <a class="uri" href="water" title="wikilink">water</a> (H<sub>2</sub>O), and releases inorganic <a class="uri" href="ions" title="wikilink">ions</a> (like <a class="uri" href="nitrogen" title="wikilink">nitrogen</a> and <a class="uri" href="phosphorus" title="wikilink">phosphorus</a>) into the soil where the surrounding plants can then reabsorb the nutrients that were shed as litterfall. In this way, litterfall becomes an important part of the nutrient cycle that sustains forest environments.</p>

<p>As litter decomposes, nutrients are released into the environment. The portion of the litter that is not readily decomposable is known as <a class="uri" href="humus" title="wikilink">humus</a>. Litter aids in soil moisture retention by cooling the ground surface and holding moisture in decaying organic matter. The flora and fauna working to decompose soil litter also aid in <a href="soil_respiration" title="wikilink">soil respiration</a>. A litter layer of decomposing <a class="uri" href="biomass" title="wikilink">biomass</a> provides a continuous energy source for macro- and micro-organisms.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Numerous <a href="reptile" title="wikilink">reptiles</a>, <a href="amphibian" title="wikilink">amphibians</a>, <a href="bird" title="wikilink">birds</a>, and even some <a href="mammal" title="wikilink">mammals</a> rely on litter for shelter and forage. For example, amphibians such as <a href="salamander" title="wikilink">salamanders</a> and <a href="caecilian" title="wikilink">caecilians</a> inhabit the damp <a class="uri" href="microclimate" title="wikilink">microclimate</a> underneath fallen leaves for part or all of their life cycle. This makes them difficult to observe. A <a class="uri" href="BBC" title="wikilink">BBC</a> film crew captured footage of a female caecilian with young for the first time in a documentary that aired in 2008.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Some species of birds require leaf litter both for foraging and as material used to construct <a href="nest" title="wikilink">nests</a>, such as the <a class="uri" href="ovenbird" title="wikilink">ovenbird</a> of eastern North America.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Sometimes litterfall even provides energy to much larger mammals, such as in <a href="boreal_forest" title="wikilink">boreal forests</a> where <a class="uri" href="lichen" title="wikilink">lichen</a> litterfall is one of the main constituents of wintering <a class="uri" href="deer" title="wikilink">deer</a> and <a class="uri" href="elk" title="wikilink">elk</a> diets.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="nutrient-cycle">Nutrient cycle</h2>

<p>During leaf <a class="uri" href="senescence" title="wikilink">senescence</a>, a portion of the plant’s nutrients are reabsorbed into the leaves. The nutrient concentrations in litterfall differ from the nutrient concentrations in the mature foliage by the reabsorption of constituents during leaf senescence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Plants that grow in areas with low nutrient availability tend to produce litter with low nutrient concentrations, but a larger proportion of the available nutrients is reabsorbed. After senescence, the nutrient-enriched leaves become litterfall and settle on the soil below.</p>

</figure>

<p>Litterfall is the dominant pathway for nutrient return to the soil, especially for <a class="uri" href="nitrogen" title="wikilink">nitrogen</a> (N) and <a class="uri" href="phosphorus" title="wikilink">phosphorus</a> (P). The accumulation of these nutrients in the top layer of soil is known as <a href="immobilization_(soil_science)" title="wikilink">soil immobilization</a>. Once the litterfall has settled, decomposition of the litter layer, accomplished through the leaching of nutrients by rainfall and <a class="uri" href="throughfall" title="wikilink">throughfall</a> and by the efforts of detritivores, releases the breakdown products into the soil below and therefore contributes to the <a class="uri" href="cation" title="wikilink">cation</a> exchange capacity of the soil. This holds especially true for highly weathered tropical soils.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Leaching_(agriculture)" title="wikilink">Leaching</a> is the process by which cations such as <a class="uri" href="iron" title="wikilink">iron</a> (Fe) and <a class="uri" href="aluminum" title="wikilink">aluminum</a> (Al), as well as organic matter are removed from the litterfall and transported downward into the soil below. This process is known as <a class="uri" href="podzolization" title="wikilink">podzolization</a> and is particularly intense in boreal and cool temperate forests that are mainly constituted by <a class="uri" href="coniferous" title="wikilink">coniferous</a> pines whose litterfall is rich in <a href="natural_phenol" title="wikilink">phenolic compounds</a> and <a href="fulvic_acid" title="wikilink">fulvic acid</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a></p>

<p>By the process of biological decomposition by <a class="uri" href="microfauna" title="wikilink">microfauna</a>, bacteria, and fungi, CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O, nutrient <a href="Chemical_element" title="wikilink">elements</a>, and an exceedingly resistant organic compound called <a class="uri" href="humus" title="wikilink">humus</a> are released. <a class="uri" href="Humus" title="wikilink">Humus</a> composes the bulk of organic matter in the lower soil profile.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a></p>

<p>The decline of nutrient ratios is also a function of decomposition of litterfall (i.e. as litterfall decomposes, more nutrients enter the soil below and the litter will have a lower nutrient ratio). Litterfall containing high nutrient concentrations will decompose more rapidly and <a class="uri" href="asymptote" title="wikilink">asymptote</a> as those nutrients decrease.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> Knowing this, ecologists have been able to use nutrient concentrations as measured by <a href="remote_sensing" title="wikilink">remote sensing</a> as an index of a potential rate of decomposition for any given area.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Globally, data from various forest ecosystems shows an inverse relationship in the decline in nutrient ratios to the apparent nutrition availability of the forest.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>

<p>Once nutrients have re-entered the soil, the plants can then reabsorb them through their <a href="root" title="wikilink">roots</a>. Therefore, nutrient reabsorption during senescence presents an opportunity for a plant’s future net primary production use. A relationship between nutrient stores can also be defined as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>annual storage of nutrients in plant tissues + replacement of losses from litterfall and leaching = the amount of uptake in an ecosystem
</dd>
</dl>
<h2 id="collection-and-analysis">Collection and analysis</h2>

<p>The main objectives of litterfall sampling and analysis are to quantify litterfall production and chemical composition over time in order to assess the variation in litterfall quantities, and hence its role in nutrient cycling across an environmental gradient of <a class="uri" href="climate" title="wikilink">climate</a> (moisture and temperature) and soil conditions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Ecologists employ a simple approach to the collection of litterfall, most of which centers around once piece of equipment, known as a <strong>litterbag</strong>. A litterbag is simply any type of container that can be set out in any given area for a specified amount of time to collect the plant litter that falls from the <a href="canopy_(biology)" title="wikilink">canopy</a> above.  Litterbags are generally set in random locations within a given area and marked with <a class="uri" href="GPS" title="wikilink">GPS</a> or local coordinates, and then monitored on a specific time interval. Once the samples have been collected, they are usually classified on type, size and <a class="uri" href="species" title="wikilink">species</a> (if possible) and recorded on a spreadsheet.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> When measuring bulk litterfall for an area, ecologists will weigh the dry contents of the litterbag. By this method litterfall flux can be defined as:</p>
<dl>
<dd>litterfall (kg m<sup>−2</sup> yr<sup>−1</sup>) = total litter mass (kg) / litterbag area (m<sup>2</sup>)<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a>
</dd>
</dl>

<p>The litterbag may also be used to study decomposition of the litter layer. By confining fresh litter in the mesh bags and placing them on the ground, an ecologist can monitor and collect the decay measurements of that litter.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> An <a href="exponential_decay" title="wikilink">exponential decay</a> pattern has been produced by this type of experiment
