Kleene's O

In set theory and computability theory, Kleene's 
 
 
 is a canonical subset of the natural numbers when regarded as ordinal notations. It contains ordinal notations for every recursive ordinal, that is, ordinals below Church–Kleene ordinal, 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is the first ordinal not representable in a computable system of ordinal notations the elements of 
 
 
 
  can be regarded as the canonical ordinal notations.
Kleene (1938) described a system of notation for all recursive ordinals (those less than the Church–Kleene ordinal). It uses a subset of the natural numbers instead of finite strings of symbols. Unfortunately, there is in general no effective way to tell whether some natural number represents an ordinal, or whether two numbers represent the same ordinal. However, one can effectively find notations which represent the ordinal sum, product, and power (see ordinal arithmetic) of any two given notations in Kleene's 
 
 
 
 ; and given any notation for an ordinal, there is a recursively enumerable set of notations which contains one element for each smaller ordinal and is effectively ordered.
Kleene's 
 
 

The basic idea of Kleene's system of ordinal notations is to build up ordinals in an effective manner. For members 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , the ordinal for which 
 
 
 
  is a notation is 
 
 
 
 . The standard definition proceeds via transfinite induction and the ordering 
 
 
 
  (a partial ordering of Kleene's 
 
 
 
 ) is defined simultaneously.

The natural number 0 belongs to Kleene's 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  belongs to Kleene's 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  belongs to Kleene's 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
 -th partial recursive function. If 
 
 
 
  is total, with range contained in 
 
 
 
 , and for every natural number 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  belongs to Kleene's 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  for each 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  is a notation for the limit of the ordinals 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  for every natural number 
 
 
 
 .


 
  and 
 
 
 
  imply 
 
 
 
  (this guarantees that 
 
 
 
  is transitive.)

This definition has the advantages that one can recursively enumerate the predecessors of a given ordinal (though not in the 
 
 
 
  ordering) and that the notations are downward closed, i.e., if there is a notation for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then there is a notation for 
 
 
 
 .

 , so

  only branches at limit ordinals; and at each notation of a limit ordinal, 
 
 
 
  is infinitely branching.
Since every recursive function has countably many indices, each infinite ordinal receives countably many notations; the finite ordinals have unique notations, 
 
 
 
  usually denoted 
 
 
 
 .
The first ordinal that doesn't receive a notation is called the Church–Kleene ordinal and is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . Since there are only countably many recursive functions, the ordinal 
 
 
 
  is evidently countable.
The ordinals with a notation in Kleene's 
 
 
 
  are exactly the recursive ordinals. (The fact that every recursive ordinal has a notation follows from the closure of this system of ordinal notations under successor and effective limits.)


 
  is not recursively enumerable, but there is a recursively enumerable relation which agrees with 
 
 
 
  precisely on members of 
 
 
 
 .
For any notation 
 
 
 
 , the set 
 
 
 
  of notations below 
 
 
 
  is recursively enumerable. However, Kleene's 
 
 
 
 , when taken as a whole, is 
 
 
 
  (see analytical hierarchy).
In fact, 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -complete and every 
 
 
 
  subset of 
 
 
 
  is effectively bounded in 
 
 
 
  (a result of Spector).


 
  is the universal system of ordinal notations in the sense that any specific set of ordinal notations can be mapped into it in a straightforward way. More precisely, there is a recursive function 
 
 
 
  such that if 
 
 
 
  is an index for a recursive well-ordering, then 
 
 
 
  is a member of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is order-isomorphic to an initial segment of the set 
 
 
 
 .
There is a recursive function 
 
 
 
 , which, for members of 
 
 
 
 , mimics ordinal addition and has the property that

Properties of paths in 
 
 

A path in 
 
 
 
  is a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  which is totally ordered by 
 
 
 
  and is closed under predecessors, i.e. if 
 
 
 
  is a member of a path 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is also a member of 
 
 
 
 . A path 
 
 
 
  is maximal if there is no element of 
 
 
 
  which is above (in the sense of 
 
 
 
 ) every member of 
 
 
 
 , otherwise 
 
 
 
  is non-maximal.

A path 
 
 
 
  is non-maximal if and only if 
 
 
 
  is recursively enumerable (r.e.). It follows by remarks above that every element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  determines a non-maximal path 
 
 
 
 ; and every non-maximal path is so determined.
There are 
 
 
 
  maximal paths through 
 
 
 
 ; since they are maximal, they are non-r.e.
In fact, there are 
 
 
 
  maximal paths within

 
  of length 
 
 
 
 . (Crossley, Schütte)
For every non-zero ordinal 
 
 
 
 , there are 
 
 
 
  maximal paths within 
 
 
 
  of length 
 
 
 
 . (Aczel)
Further, if 
 
 
 
  is a path whose length is not a multiple of 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is not maximal. (Aczel)
For each r.e. degree 
 
 
 
 , there is a member 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that the path 
 
 
 
  has many-one degree 
 
 
 
 . In fact, for each recursive ordinal 
 
 
 
 , a notation 
 
 
 
  exists with 
 
 
 
 . (Jockusch)
There exist 
 
 
 
  paths through 
 
 
 
  which are 
 
 
 
 . Given a progression of recursively enumerable theories based on iterating Uniform Reflection, each such path is incomplete with respect to the set of true 
 
 
 
  sentences. (Feferman & Spector)
There exist 
 
 
 
  paths through 
 
 
 
  each initial segment of which is not merely r.e., but recursive. (Jockusch)
Various other paths in 
 
 
 
  have been shown to exist, each with specific kinds of reducibility properties. (See references below)
