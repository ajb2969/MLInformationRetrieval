   Major index      Major index   In mathematics (and particularly in combinatorics ), the major index of a permutation is the sum of the positions of the descents of the permutation. In symbols, the major index of the permutation w is        maj   (  w  )    =    ∑    w   (  i  )    >   w   (   i  +  1   )      i    .       maj  w     subscript       w  i     w    i  1      i     \operatorname{maj}(w)=\sum_{w(i)>w(i+1)}i.     For example, if w is given in one-line notation by w = 351624 (that is, w is the permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6} such that w (1) = 3, w (2) = 5, etc.) then w has descents at positions 2 (from 5 to 1) and 4 (from 6 to 2) and so maj( w ) = 2 + 4 = 6.  This statistic is named after Major Percy Alexander MacMahon who showed in 1913 that the distribution of the major index on all permutations of a fixed length is the same as the distribution of inversions . That is, the number of permutations of length n with k inversions is the same as the number of permutations of length n with major index equal to k . (These numbers are known as Mahonian numbers , also in honor of MacMahon. 1 ) In fact, a stronger result is true: the number of permutations of length n with major index k and i inversions is the same as the number of permutations of length n with major index i and k inversions, that is, the two statistics are equidistributed. For example, the number of permutations of length 4 with given major index and number of inversions is given in the table below.          0    1    2    3    4    5    6      0    1    0    0    0    0    0    0      1    0    1    1    1    0    0    0      2    0    1    2    1    1    0    0      3    0    1    1    2    1    1    0      4    0    0    1    1    2    1    0      5    0    0    0    1    1    1    0      6    0    0    0    0    0    0    1         missing-subexpression   0  1  2  3  4  5  6    0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0    1  0  1  1  1  0  0  0    2  0  1  2  1  1  0  0    3  0  1  1  2  1  1  0    4  0  0  1  1  2  1  0    5  0  0  0  1  1  1  0    6  0  0  0  0  0  0  1     \begin{array}[]{c|ccccccc}&0&1&2&3&4&5&6\\
