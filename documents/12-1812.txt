   Liquid junction potential      Liquid junction potential   Liquid junction potential occurs when two solutions of different concentrations are in contact with each other. The more concentrated solution will have a tendency to diffuse into the comparatively less concentrated one. The rate of diffusion of each ion will be roughly proportional to its speed in an electric field. If the anions diffuse more rapidly than the cations , they will diffuse ahead into the dilute solution, leaving the latter negatively charged and the concentrated solution positively charged. This will result in an electrical double layer of positive and negative charges at the junction of the two solutions. Thus at the point of junction, a potential difference will develop because of the ionic transfer . This potential is called liquid junction potential or diffusion potential. The magnitude of the potential depends on the relative speeds of the ions' movement.  Calculation  The liquid junction potential cannot be measured directly but calculated. The Electromotive force (EMF) of a concentration cell with transference includes the liquid junction potential.

The most common method of eliminating the liquid junction potential is to place a salt bridge consisting of a saturated solution of potassium chloride (KCl) and ammonium nitrate (NH 4 NO 3 ) with lithium acetate (CH 3 COOLi) between the two solutions constituting the junction. When such a bridge is used, the ions in the bridge are present in large excess at the junction and they carry almost the whole of the current across the boundary. The efficiency of KCl/NH 4 NO 3 is connected with the fact that in these salts, the transport numbers of anions and cations are the same.
