   Gδ set      Gδ set   In the mathematical field of topology , a G δ set is a subset of a topological space that is a countable intersection of open sets. The notation originated in Germany with G for Gebiet ( German : area, or neighborhood) meaning open set in this case and δ for Durchschnitt ( German : intersection ). The term inner limiting set is also used. G δ sets, and their dual F σ sets , are the second level of the Borel hierarchy .  Definition  In a topological space a G δ set is a countable  intersection of open sets . The G δ sets are exactly the level    𝚷  2  0     subscript   superscript  𝚷  0   2    \mathbf{\Pi}^{0}_{2}   sets of the Borel hierarchy .  Examples   Any open set is trivially a G δ set    The irrational numbers are a G δ set in the real numbers R . They can be written as the countable intersection of the sets { q } C where q is rational .    The set of rational numbers Q is not a G δ set in R . If Q were the intersection of open sets A n , each A n would be dense in R because Q is dense in R . However, the construction above gave the irrational numbers as a countable intersection of open dense subsets. Taking the intersection of both of these sets gives the empty set as a countable intersection of open dense sets in R , a violation of the Baire category theorem .    The zero-set of a derivative of an everywhere differentiable real-valued function on R is a G δ set; it can be a dense set with empty interior, as shown by Pompeiu's construction .   A more elaborate example of a G δ set is given by the following theorem:  Theorem: The set    D  =   {   f  ∈   C   (   [  0  ,  1  ]   )     :   f  is not differentiable at any point of   [  0  ,  1  ]    }       D   conditional-set    f    C   0  1       f  is not differentiable at any point of   0  1       D=\left\{f\in C([0,1]):f\text{ is not differentiable at any point of }[0,1]\right\}   contains a dense G δ subset of the metric space    C   (   [  0  ,  1  ]   )       C   0  1     C([0,1])   . (See Weierstrass function#Density of nowhere-differentiable functions .)  Properties  The notion of G δ sets in metric (and topological ) spaces is strongly related to the notion of completeness of the metric space as well as to the Baire category theorem . This is described by the Mazurkiewicz theorem:  Theorem ( Mazurkiewicz ): Let    (  𝒳  ,  ρ  )     𝒳  ρ    (\mathcal{X},\rho)   be a complete metric space and    A  ⊂  𝒳      A  𝒳    A\subset\mathcal{X}   . Then the following are equivalent:      A   A   A   is a G δ subset of   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}     There is a metric    σ   σ   \sigma   on   A   A   A   which is equivalent to    ρ  |  A     fragments  ρ  normal-|  A    \rho|A   such that    (  A  ,  σ  )     A  σ    (A,\sigma)   is a complete metric space.   A key property of    G  δ     subscript  G  δ    G_{\delta}   sets is that they are the possible sets at which a function from a topological space to a metric space is continuous . Formally: The set of points where a function   f   f   f   is continuous is a    G  δ     subscript  G  δ    G_{\delta}   set. This is because continuity at a point   p   p   p   can be defined by a    Π  2  0     subscript   superscript  normal-Π  0   2    \Pi^{0}_{2}   formula, namely: For all positive integers   n   n   n   , there is an open set   U   U   U   containing   p   p   p   such that     d   (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    <   1  /  n         d     f  x     f  y       1  n     d(f(x),f(y))<1/n   for all    x  ,  y     x  y    x,y   in   U   U   U   . If a value of   n   n   n   is fixed, the set of   p   p   p   for which there is such a corresponding open   U   U   U   is itself an open set (being a union of open sets), and the universal quantifier on   n   n   n   corresponds to the (countable) intersection of these sets. In the real line, the converse holds as well; for any G δ subset A of the real line, there is a function f : R → R which is continuous exactly at the points in A . As a consequence, while it is possible for the irrationals to be the set of continuity points of a function (see the popcorn function ), it is impossible to construct a function which is continuous only on the rational numbers.  Basic properties   The complement of a G δ set is an F σ set.    The intersection of countably many G δ sets is a G δ set, and the union of finitely many G δ sets is a G δ set; a countable union of G δ sets is called a G δσ set.    In metrizable spaces, every closed set is a G δ set and, dually, every open set is an F σ set.    A subspace  A of a completely metrizable space X is itself completely metrizable if and only if A is a G δ set in X .    A set that contains the intersection of a countable collection of dense open sets is called comeagre or residual. These sets are used to define generic properties of topological spaces of functions.   The following results regard Polish spaces : 1   Let    (  𝒳  ,  𝒯  )     𝒳  𝒯    (\mathcal{X},\mathcal{T})   be a Polish topological space and let    G  ⊂  𝒳      G  𝒳    G\subset\mathcal{X}   be a G δ set (with respect to   𝒯   𝒯   \mathcal{T}   ). Then   G   G   G   is a Polish space with respect to the subspace topology on it.    Topological characterization of Polish spaces: If   𝒳   𝒳   \mathcal{X}   is a Polish space then it is homeomorphic to a G δ subset of a compact  metric space .   G δ space  A G δ space is a topological space in which every closed set is a G δ set . A normal space which is also a G δ space is perfectly normal . Every metrizable space is perfectly normal, and every perfectly normal space is completely normal : neither implication is reversible.
