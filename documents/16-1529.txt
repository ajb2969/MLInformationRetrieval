   Draft:Locally free sheaf and an algebraic vector bundle      Draft:Locally free sheaf and an algebraic vector bundle   To fix the idea, it is useful to consider vector bundles in topology first. Let E be a vector bundle of rank n over a topological space X . If E is trivial, then the continuous sections of E over an open set U can be identified with n -tuple of continuous functions on U . Thus, the sheaf of continuous sections     E  ~   =   Γ   (  -  ,  E  )         normal-~  E     normal-Γ    E      \tilde{E}=\Gamma(-,E)   can be identified with the direct sum of n -copies of    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   . It follows that, in general, there are open cover U i of X such that         E  ~    U  i    ≃   𝒪   U  i    ⊕  n     .     similar-to-or-equals   subscript   normal-~  E    subscript  U  i     superscript   subscript  𝒪   subscript  U  i     direct-sum  n      \tilde{E}_{U_{i}}\simeq\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}}^{\oplus n}.     Let F be a locally free sheaf of rank n on a Noetherian scheme  X . Then, by definition, there are open affine cover U i of X such that         F  |    U  i    ≃   𝒪   U  i    ⊕  n     .     similar-to-or-equals   evaluated-at  F   subscript  U  i     superscript   subscript  𝒪   subscript  U  i     direct-sum  n      F|_{U_{i}}\simeq\mathcal{O}_{U_{i}}^{\oplus n}.   The overlaps determine the functions:        g   i  j    ∈   Aut   (   Γ   (    U  i   ∩   U  j    ,  𝒪  )    )     ,       subscript  g    i  j     Aut    normal-Γ      subscript  U  i    subscript  U  j    𝒪       g_{ij}\in\operatorname{Aut}(\Gamma(U_{i}\cap U_{j},\mathcal{O})),   that satisfies the cocycle condition :         g   i  k    ∘   g   k  j     =   g   i  j     .         subscript  g    i  k     subscript  g    k  j      subscript  g    i  j      g_{ik}\circ g_{kj}=g_{ij}.   Conversely, as in topology, the transition functions determine a locally free sheaf of rank n (since free sheaves glue if and only if cocycle condition holds.)  In algebraic geometry, to give a vector space is to give its coordinate ring ( ring of polynomial functions )    V  ↦   Spec   Sym   (   V  *   )        maps-to  V   Spec   Sym   superscript  V        V\mapsto\operatorname{Spec}\operatorname{Sym}(V^{*})   is the equivalence between the category of vector spaces and the category of affine spaces. This correspondence globalizes: the category of algebraic vector bundles is equivalent to the category of locally free sheaves."
