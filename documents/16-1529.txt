Draft:Locally free sheaf and an algebraic vector bundle

To fix the idea, it is useful to consider vector bundles in topology first. Let E be a vector bundle of rank n over a topological space X. If E is trivial, then the continuous sections of E over an open set U can be identified with n-tuple of continuous functions on U. Thus, the sheaf of continuous sections 
 
 
 
  can be identified with the direct sum of n-copies of 
 
 
 
 . It follows that, in general, there are open cover Ui of X such that



Let F be a locally free sheaf of rank n on a Noetherian scheme X. Then, by definition, there are open affine cover Ui of X such that


 
  The overlaps determine the functions:


 
  that satisfies the cocycle condition:


 
  Conversely, as in topology, the transition functions determine a locally free sheaf of rank n (since free sheaves glue if and only if cocycle condition holds.)
In algebraic geometry, to give a vector space is to give its coordinate ring (ring of polynomial functions)
 
 
 
  is the equivalence between the category of vector spaces and the category of affine spaces. This correspondence globalizes: the category of algebraic vector bundles is equivalent to the category of locally free sheaves."
