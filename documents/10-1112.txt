   Plasmanylethanolamine desaturase      Plasmanylethanolamine desaturase   In enzymology , a plasmanylethanolamine desaturase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   O-1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   O-1-alk-1-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + A + 2 H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are O-1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine , an electron acceptor AH 2 , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are O-1-alk-1-enyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine , the reduction product A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is O-1-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine,hydrogen-donor:oxy gen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include alkylacylglycerophosphoethanolamine desaturase , alkylacylglycero-phosphorylethanolamine dehydrogenase , dehydrogenase, alkyl-acylglycerophosphorylethanolamine , 1-O-alkyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine desaturase , and 1-O-alkyl 2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphorylethanolamine desaturase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism . It has 3 cofactors : ATP , Manganese , and Magnesium .
