   Steenrod algebra      Steenrod algebra   In algebraic topology , a Steenrod algebra was defined by  to be the algebra of stable cohomology operations for mod p cohomology.  For a given prime number  p , the Steenrod algebra A p is the graded Hopf algebra over the field F p of order p , consisting of all stable cohomology operations for mod p  cohomology . It is generated by the Steenrod squares introduced by  for p =2, and by the Steenrod reduced p th powers introduced in  and the Bockstein homomorphism for p >2.  The term "Steenrod algebra" is also sometimes used for the algebra of cohomology operations of a generalized cohomology theory .  Cohomology operations  A cohomology operation is a natural transformation between cohomology functors. For example, if we take cohomology with coefficients in a ring , the cup product squaring operation yields a family of cohomology operations:        H  n    (  X  ;  R  )    →    H   2  n     (  X  ;  R  )       normal-→     superscript  H  n    X  R       superscript  H    2  n     X  R      H^{n}(X;R)\to H^{2n}(X;R)          x  ↦  x  ⌣  x   .       maps-to  x  x    normal-⌣    x     x\mapsto x\smile x.     Cohomology operations need not be homomorphisms of graded rings, see the Cartan formula below.  These operations do not commute with suspension , that is they are unstable. (This is because if Y is a suspension of a space X , the cup product on the cohomology of Y is trivial.) Norman Steenrod constructed stable operations       S   q  i    :     H  n    (  X  ;   𝐙  /  2   )    →    H   n  +  i     (  X  ;   𝐙  /  2   )        normal-:    S   superscript  q  i     normal-→     superscript  H  n    X    𝐙  2        superscript  H    n  i     X    𝐙  2        Sq^{i}\colon H^{n}(X;\mathbf{Z}/2)\to H^{n+i}(X;\mathbf{Z}/2)          P  i   :     H  n    (  X  ;   𝐙  /  p   )    →    H   n  +   2  i   (   p  -  1   )       (  X  ;   𝐙  /  p   )        normal-:   superscript  P  i    normal-→     superscript  H  n    X    𝐙  p        superscript  H    n    2  i    p  1       X    𝐙  p        P^{i}\colon H^{n}(X;\mathbf{Z}/p)\to H^{n+2i(p-1)}(X;\mathbf{Z}/p)     for all i greater than zero. The notation Sq and their name, the Steenrod squares, comes from the fact that Sq n restricted to classes of degree n is the cup square. There are analogous operations for odd primary coefficients, usually denoted P i and called the reduced p -th power operations. The Sq i generate a connected graded algebra over Z/2 , where the multiplication is given by composition of operations. This is the mod 2 Steenrod algebra. In the case p > 2, the mod p Steenrod algebra is generated by the P i and the Bockstein operation β associated to the short exact sequence      0  →   𝐙  /  p   →   𝐙  /   p  2    →   𝐙  /  p   →  0.       normal-→  0    𝐙  p     normal-→      𝐙   superscript  p  2      normal-→      𝐙  p     normal-→    0.     0\to\mathbf{Z}/p\to\mathbf{Z}/p^{2}\to\mathbf{Z}/p\to 0.     In the case p =2, the Bockstein element is Sq 1 and the reduced p -th power P i is Sq 2 i .  Axiomatic characterization  showed that the Steenrod squares Sq n :H m →H m + n are characterized by the following 5 axioms:   Naturality: Sq n is an additive homomorphism from H m ( X , Z /2 Z ) to H m + n ( X , Z /2 Z ), and is natural meaning that for any map f : X → Y , f *( Sq n x ) = Sq n f *(x).  Sq 0 is the identity homomorphism.  Sq n is the cup square on classes of degree n .  If n >deg( x ) then Sq n ( x ) = 0  Cartan Formula    S   q  n    (  x  ⌣  y  )   =   ∑    i  +  j   =  n     (  S   q  i   x  )   ⌣   (  S   q  j   y  )      fragments  S   superscript  q  n    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-⌣  y  normal-)     subscript       i  j   n     fragments  normal-(  S   superscript  q  i   x  normal-)   normal-⌣   fragments  normal-(  S   superscript  q  j   y  normal-)     Sq^{n}(x\smile y)=\sum_{i+j=n}(Sq^{i}x)\smile(Sq^{j}y)      In addition the Steenrod squares have the following properties:   Sq 1 is the Bockstein homomorphism of the exact sequence    0  →   𝐙  /  2   →   𝐙  /  4   →   𝐙  /  2   →  0.       normal-→  0    𝐙  2     normal-→      𝐙  4     normal-→      𝐙  2     normal-→    0.     0\to\mathbf{Z}/2\to\mathbf{Z}/4\to\mathbf{Z}/2\to 0.     They satisfy the Adem relations, described below.  They commute with the suspension homomorphism and the boundary operator.   Similarly the following axioms characterize the reduced p -th powers for p > 2.   Naturality: P n is an additive homomorphism from H m ( X , Z /''p Z ) to H m +2 n ( p −1) ( X , Z / p' 'Z ), and is natural.  P 0 is the identity homomorphism.  P n is the cup p -th power on classes of degree 2 n .  If 2 n >dim( X ) then P n ( x ) = 0  Cartan Formula     P  n    (  x  ⌣  y  )   =   ∑    i  +  j   =  n     (   P  i   x  )   ⌣   (   P  j   y  )      fragments   superscript  P  n    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-⌣  y  normal-)     subscript       i  j   n     fragments  normal-(   superscript  P  i   x  normal-)   normal-⌣   fragments  normal-(   superscript  P  j   y  normal-)     P^{n}(x\smile y)=\sum_{i+j=n}(P^{i}x)\smile(P^{j}y)      As before, the reduced p -th powers also satisfy Adem relations and commute with the suspension and boundary operators.  Adem relations  The Adem relations for p =2 were conjectured by  and proved by  and are given by       S   q  i   S   q  j    =    ∑   k  =  0    [   i  /  2   ]      (      j  -  k  -  1        i  -   2  k       )   S   q    i  +  j   -  k    S   q  k           S   superscript  q  i   S   superscript  q  j      superscript   subscript     k  0     delimited-[]    i  2        binomial    j  k  1     i    2  k     S   superscript  q      i  j   k    S   superscript  q  k       Sq^{i}Sq^{j}=\sum_{k=0}^{[i/2]}{j-k-1\choose i-2k}Sq^{i+j-k}Sq^{k}     for all i , j > 0 such that i P^{a}P^{b} = \sum_i (-1)^{a+i}{(p-1)(b-i)-1 \choose a-pi} P^{a+b-i}P^i for a P^{a}\beta P^{b} = \sum_i (-1)^{a+i}{(p-1)(b-i) \choose a-pi} \beta P^{a+b-i}P^i+ \sum_i (-1)^{a+i+1}{(p-1)(b-i)-1 \choose a-pi-1} P^{a+b-i}\beta P^i for a ≤ pb  Bullett–Macdonald identities  reformulated the Adem relations as the following Bullett–Macdonald identities.  For p =2 put       P   (  t  )    =    ∑   i  ≥  0      t  i    Sq  i           P  t     subscript     i  0       superscript  t  i    superscript  Sq  i       P(t)=\sum_{i\geq 0}t^{i}\text{Sq}^{i}   then the Adem relations are equivalent to         P   (    s  2   +   s  t    )    ⋅  P    (   t  2   )    =     P   (    t  2   +   s  t    )    ⋅  P    (   s  2   )           normal-⋅    P     superscript  s  2     s  t     P    superscript  t  2       normal-⋅    P     superscript  t  2     s  t     P    superscript  s  2      P(s^{2}+st)\cdot P(t^{2})=P(t^{2}+st)\cdot P(s^{2})     For p >2 put       P   (  t  )    =    ∑   i  ≥  0      t  i    P  i           P  t     subscript     i  0       superscript  t  i    superscript  P  i       P(t)=\sum_{i\geq 0}t^{i}\text{P}^{i}   then the Adem relations are equivalent to the statement that       (   1  +   s  Ad  β    )   P   (    t  p   +    t   p  -  1    s   +  ⋯  +   t   s   p  -  1      )   P   (   s  p   )         1    s  Ad  β    P     superscript  t  p      superscript  t    p  1    s   normal-⋯    t   superscript  s    p  1      P   superscript  s  p     (1+s\text{Ad}\beta)P(t^{p}+t^{p-1}s+\cdots+ts^{p-1})P(s^{p})   is symmetric in s and t . Here β is the Bockstein operation and (Ad β) P = β P − P β.  Construction  Suppose that π is any degree n subgroup of the symmetric group on n points, u a cohomology class in H q ( X , B ), A an abelian group acted on by π, and c a cohomology class in H i (π, A ).  showed how to construct a reduced power u n / c in H kq− i (X ,( A ⊗ B ⊗ B ⊗...⊗ B'')/π) as follows.   Taking the external product of u with itself n times gives an equivariant cocycle on X n with coefficients in B ⊗ B ⊗...⊗ B .  Choose E to be a contractible space on which π acts freely and an equivariant map from E × X to X n . Pulling back u n by this map gives an equivariant cocyle on E × X and therefore a cocycle of E /π× X with coefficients in B ⊗ B ⊗...⊗ B .  Taking a slant product with c in H i ( E /π, A )gives a cocycle of X with coefficients in H 0 (π, A ⊗ B ⊗ B ⊗...⊗ B )   The Steenrod squares and reduced powers are special cases of this construction where π is a cyclic group of prime order p = n acting as a cyclic permutation of n elements, and the groups A and B are cyclic of order p , so that H 0 (π, A ⊗ B ⊗ B ⊗...⊗ B ) is also cyclic of order p .  The structure of the Steenrod algebra  (for p =2) and  (for p >2) described the structure of the Steenrod algebra of stable mod p cohomology operations, showing that it is generated by the Bockstein homomorphism together with the Steenrod reduced powers, and the Adem relations generate the ideal of relations between these generators. In particular they found an explicit basis for the Steenrod algebra. This basis relies on a certain notion of admissibility for integer sequences. We say a sequence       i  1   ,   i  2   ,  …  ,   i  n       subscript  i  1    subscript  i  2   normal-…   subscript  i  n     i_{1},i_{2},\ldots,i_{n}     is admissible if for each j , i j ≥ 2 i j +1 . Then the elements        S   q  I    =   S   q   i  1    …  S   q   i  n      ,        S   superscript  q  I      S   superscript  q   subscript  i  1    normal-…  S   superscript  q   subscript  i  n       Sq^{I}=Sq^{i_{1}}\ldots Sq^{i_{n}},     where I is an admissible sequence, form a basis (the Serre-Cartan basis) for the mod 2 Steenrod algebra. There is a similar basis for the case p > 2 consisting of the elements        S   q  p  I    =   S   q  p   i  1    …  S   q  p   i  n      ,        S   superscript   subscript  q  p   I      S   superscript   subscript  q  p    subscript  i  1    normal-…  S   superscript   subscript  q  p    subscript  i  n       Sq_{p}^{I}=Sq_{p}^{i_{1}}\ldots Sq_{p}^{i_{n}},     such that       i  j   ≥   p   i   j  +  1          subscript  i  j     p   subscript  i    j  1       i_{j}\geq pi_{j+1}          i  j   ≡   0  ,   1  mod   2   (   p  -  1   )           subscript  i  j    0   modulo  1    2    p  1        i_{j}\equiv 0,1\bmod 2(p-1)          S   q  p   2  k   (   p  -  1   )      =   P  k         S   superscript   subscript  q  p     2  k    p  1       superscript  P  k     Sq_{p}^{2k(p-1)}=P^{k}          S   q  p    2  k   (   p  -  1   )    +  1     =   β   P  k          S   superscript   subscript  q  p       2  k    p  1    1       β   superscript  P  k      Sq_{p}^{2k(p-1)+1}=\beta P^{k}     Hopf algebra structure and the Milnor basis  The Steenrod algebra has more structure than a graded F p -algebra. It is also a Hopf algebra , so that in particular there is a diagonal or comultiplication map       ψ  :   A  →   A  ⊗  A     .     normal-:  ψ   normal-→  A   tensor-product  A  A      \psi\colon A\to A\otimes A.     induced by the Cartan formula for the action of the Steenrod algebra on the cup product. It is easier to describe than the product map, and is given by       ψ   (   S   q  k    )    =    ∑    i  +  j   =  k       S   q  i    ⊗  S    q  j           ψ    S   superscript  q  k       subscript       i  j   k       tensor-product    S   superscript  q  i    S    superscript  q  j       \psi(Sq^{k})=\sum_{i+j=k}Sq^{i}\otimes Sq^{j}          ψ   (   P  k   )    =    ∑    i  +  j   =  k      P  i   ⊗   P  j           ψ   superscript  P  k      subscript       i  j   k     tensor-product   superscript  P  i    superscript  P  j       \psi(P^{k})=\sum_{i+j=k}P^{i}\otimes P^{j}           ψ   (  β  )    =    β  ⊗  1   +   1  ⊗  β     .        ψ  β      tensor-product  β  1    tensor-product  1  β      \psi(\beta)=\beta\otimes 1+1\otimes\beta.     The linear dual of ψ makes the (graded) linear dual  A * of A into an algebra.  proved, for p = 2, that A * is a polynomial algebra , with one generator ξ k of degree 2 k - 1, for every k , and for p >2 the dual Steenrod algebra A * is the tensor product of the polynomial algebra in generators ξ k of degree 2 p k - 2 ( k ≥1) and the exterior algebra in generators τ k of degree 2 p k - 1 ( k ≥0). The monomial basis for A * then gives another choice of basis for A , called the Milnor basis. The dual to the Steenrod algebra is often more convenient to work with, because the multiplication is (super) commutative. The comultiplication for A * is the dual of the product on A ; it is given by        ψ   (   ξ  n   )    =    ∑   i  =  0   n     ξ   n  -  i    p  i    ⊗   ξ  i      .        ψ   subscript  ξ  n      superscript   subscript     i  0    n    tensor-product   superscript   subscript  ξ    n  i     superscript  p  i     subscript  ξ  i       \psi(\xi_{n})=\sum_{i=0}^{n}\xi_{n-i}^{p^{i}}\otimes\xi_{i}.   where ξ 0 =1, and       ψ   (   τ  n   )    =     τ  n   ⊗  1   +    ∑   i  =  0   n     ξ   n  -  i    p  i    ⊗   τ  i            ψ   subscript  τ  n       tensor-product   subscript  τ  n   1     superscript   subscript     i  0    n    tensor-product   superscript   subscript  ξ    n  i     superscript  p  i     subscript  τ  i        \psi(\tau_{n})=\tau_{n}\otimes 1+\sum_{i=0}^{n}\xi_{n-i}^{p^{i}}\otimes\tau_{i}   if p >2  The only primitive elements of A * for p =2 are the    ξ  1   2  i      superscript   subscript  ξ  1    superscript  2  i     \xi_{1}^{2^{i}}   , and these are dual to the    S   q   2  i        S   superscript  q   superscript  2  i      Sq^{2^{i}}   (the only indecomposables of A ).  Relation to formal groups  The dual Steenrod algebras are supercommutative Hopf algebras, so their spectra are algebra supergroup schemes. These group schemes are closely related to the automorphisms of 1-dimensional additive formal groups. For example, if p =2 then the dual Steenrod algebra is the group scheme of automorphisms of the 1-dimensional additive formal group scheme x + y that are the identity to first order. These automorphisms are of the form      x  →   x  +    ξ  1    x  2    +    ξ  2    x  4    +    ξ  3    x  8    +  ⋯      normal-→  x    x     subscript  ξ  1    superscript  x  2       subscript  ξ  2    superscript  x  4       subscript  ξ  3    superscript  x  8    normal-⋯     x\rightarrow x+\xi_{1}x^{2}+\xi_{2}x^{4}+\xi_{3}x^{8}+\cdots     Algebraic construction  gave the following algebraic construction of the Steenrod algebra over a finite field  F q of order q . If V is a vector space over F q then write SV for the symmetric algebra of V . There is an algebra homomorphism  P ( x )       P   (  x  )    :    S  V   [   [  x  ]   ]    →   S  V   [   [  x  ]   ]        normal-:    P  x    normal-→    S  V   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  x       S  V   delimited-[]   delimited-[]  x        P(x):SV[[x]]\rightarrow SV[[x]]   such that       P   (  x  )    (  v  )    =   v  +   F   (  v  )   x    =   v  +    v  q   x            P  x  v     v    F  v  x           v     superscript  v  q   x       \displaystyle P(x)(v)=v+F(v)x=v+v^{q}x   for v ∈ V , where F is the Frobenius endomorphism of SV . If we put       P   (  x  )    (  f  )    =   ∑    P  i    (  f  )    x  i           P  x  f        superscript  P  i   f   superscript  x  i       P(x)(f)=\sum P^{i}(f)x^{i}   (for p >2) or       P   (  x  )    (  f  )    =   ∑   S   q   2  i     (  f  )    x  i           P  x  f       S   superscript  q    2  i    f   superscript  x  i       P(x)(f)=\sum Sq^{2i}(f)x^{i}   (for p =2) for f ∈ SV then if V is infinite dimensional the elements P i generate an algebra isomorphism to the subalgebra of the Steenrod algebra generated by the reduced p ′th powers for p odd, or the even Steenrod squares Sq 2 i for p =2.  Applications  The most famous early applications of the Steenrod algebra to outstanding topological problems were the solutions by J. Frank Adams of the Hopf invariant one problem and the vector fields on spheres problem. Independently Milnor and Bott, as well as Kervaire, gave a second solution of the Hopf invariant one problem, using operations in K-theory ; these are the Adams operations . One application of the mod 2 Steenrod algebra that is fairly elementary is the following theorem.  Theorem . If there is a map S 2 n - 1 → S n of Hopf invariant one , then n is a power of 2.  The proof uses the fact that each Sq k is decomposable for k which is not a power of 2; that is, such an element is a product of squares of strictly smaller degree.  Connection to the Adams spectral sequence and the homotopy groups of spheres  The cohomology of the Steenrod algebra is the E 2 term for the ( p -local ) Adams spectral sequence , whose abutment is the p -component of the stable homotopy groups of spheres. More specifically, the E 2 term of this spectral sequence may be identified as        Ext  A   s  ,  t     (   𝐅  p   ,   𝐅  p   )    .       subscript   superscript  Ext   s  t    A     subscript  𝐅  p    subscript  𝐅  p      \mathrm{Ext}^{s,t}_{A}(\mathbf{F}_{p},\mathbf{F}_{p}).     This is what is meant by the aphorism "the cohomology of the Steenrod algebra is an approximation to the stable homotopy groups of spheres."
