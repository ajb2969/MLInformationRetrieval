   Pentagonal prism      Pentagonal prism   In geometry , the pentagonal prism is a prism with a pentagonal base. It is a type of heptahedron with 7 faces , 15 edges , and 10 vertices .  As a semiregular (or uniform) polyhedron  If faces are all regular, the pentagonal prism is a semiregular polyhedron , more generally, a uniform polyhedron , and the third in an infinite set of prisms formed by square sides and two regular polygon caps. It can be seen as a truncated  pentagonal hosohedron , represented by Schl√§fli symbol t{2,5}. Alternately it can be seen as the Cartesian product of a regular pentagon and a line segment , and represented by the product {5}x{}. The dual of a pentagonal prism is a pentagonal bipyramid .  The symmetry group of a right pentagonal prism is D 5h of order 20. The rotation group is D 5 of order 10.  Volume  The volume, as for all prisms, is the product of the area of the pentagonal base times the height or distance along any edge perpendicular to the base. For a uniform pentagonal prism with edges h the formula is        h  3   4     5   (   5  +   2   5     )            superscript  h  3   4       5    5    2    5         \frac{h^{3}}{4}\sqrt{5(5+2\sqrt{5})}     Use  Nonuniform pentagonal prisms called pentaprisms are also used in optics to rotate an image through a right angle without changing its chirality .
