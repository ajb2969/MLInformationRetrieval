   Zymology      Zymology   Zymology is the study of zymurgy (from the Greek: ζύμωσις+ἔργον, the workings of fermentation), the area of applied science related to fermentation . It deals with the biochemical processes involved in fermentation, with yeast and bacteria selection and physiology , and with the practical issues of fermentation, including brewing , wine making , fermenting milk and other fermented foods . Zymology is also known as zymurgy .  Fermentation  Fermentation can be simply defined, in this context, as the conversion of sugar molecules into ethanol and carbon dioxide by yeast .

Pasteur originally defined fermentation as respiration without air .  Pasteur performed careful research and concluded, "I am of the opinion that alcoholic fermentation never occurs without simultaneous organization, development and multiplication of cells . . .. If asked, in what consists the chemical act whereby the sugar is decomposed . . . I am completely ignorant of it." .  The German  Eduard Buchner , winner of the 1907 Nobel Prize in chemistry, later determined that fermentation was actually caused by a yeast secretion that he termed zymase .  The research efforts undertaken by the Danish  Carlsberg scientists greatly accelerated the increase in knowledge about yeast and brewing. The Carlsberg scientists are generally acknowledged as jump-starting the entire field of molecular biology .
