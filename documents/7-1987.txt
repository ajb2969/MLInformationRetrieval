Most distant

OGLE-2005-BLG-390Lb4

OGLE-2005-BLG-390L5

21,500 ± 3,300 light years

An analysis of the lightcurve of the microlensing event PA-99-N2 suggests the presence of a planet orbiting a star in the Andromeda Galaxy (2.54 ± 0.11 Mly).6 A controversial microlensing event of lobe A of the double gravitationally lensed Q0957+561 suggests that there is a planet in the lensing galaxy lying at redshift 0.355 (3.7 Gly).''78

4.37 light years11

With a mass of about 1.1 times the mass of Earth, it is very similar in size to Earth.



Star with the brightest apparent magnitude with a planet

Pollux b

Pollux12

Apparent magnitude is 1.14

The evidence of planets around Vega with an apparent magnitude of 0.03 is strongly suggested by circumstellar disks surrounding it. Currently no planets have been confirmed yet.13



Largest angular distance separation from its host star

GU Piscium b

GU Piscium

42 arc seconds14

WD 0806-661 b has an angular separation of 130.208333 arc seconds from WD 0806-661. However, its planetary origin is unknown.

DENIS-P J082303.1-49120116

Jupiter masses17

Most massive planet in the NASA Exoplanet Archive although, according to most definitions of planet, it may be too massive to be a planet, and may be a brown dwarf instead. It is part of an ultracool binary system.18



Least massive

0.02 MEarth2324

Mass of PSR B1257+12 A is based on an assumption of coplanarity with the outer two planets. The least massive exoplanet for which a true mass is known is Gliese 581 e with a mass of 2 MEarth.

HAT-P-32b 25

HAT-P-32

CT Chamaeleontis b is slightly larger at 2.2 Jupiter radii, but may be a brown dwarf star

Kepler-37

0.30 Earth radii

Slightly larger than the Moon.



Most dense

PSR J1719-1438 b

PSR J1719-1438

Pulsar planet; minimum density is inferred via Roche limit of the host star.



Least dense

Kepler-51c, b and/or possibly d26

Kepler-5127

~ 0.03 g/cm328

The densities of Kepler-51 b and c have been constrained to be below 0.05 g/cm3 (expected value 0.03 g/cm3 for each). The density of Kepler-51d is determined to be 0.046±0.009 g/cm3.29

Lowest metallicity

Kepler-271b,c

Kepler-271

−0.951 dex

BD+20°2457 may be the lowest metallicity planet host ([Fe/H]=−1.00), however the proposed planetary system is dynamically unstable. 2 The next lowest-metallicity system is Kepler-271. Planets were announced around even the extremely low metallicity stars HIP 13044 and HIP 11952, however these claims have since been disproven.
