   GDP-4-dehydro-D-rhamnose reductase      GDP-4-dehydro-D-rhamnose reductase   In enzymology , a GDP-4-dehydro-D-rhamnose reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP-6-deoxy-D-mannose + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are GDP-6-deoxy-D-mannose , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are GDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-mannose , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-6-deoxy-D-mannose:NAD(P) + 4-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include GDP-4-keto-6-deoxy-D-mannose reductase , GDP-4-keto-D-rhamnose reductase , and guanosine diphosphate-4-keto-D-rhamnose reductase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism .
