De Branges space

In mathematics, a de Branges space (sometimes written De Branges space) is a concept in functional analysis and is constructed from a de Branges function.
The concept is named after Louis de Branges who proved numerous results regarding these spaces, especially as Hilbert spaces, and used those results to prove the Bieberbach conjecture.
De Branges functions
A de Branges function is an entire function E from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  that satisfies the inequality 
 
 
 
 , for all z in the upper half of the complex plane

 
 .
Definition 1
Given a de Branges function E, the de Branges space B(E) is defined as the set of all entire functions F such that



where:



 
  is the open upper half of the complex plane.


 
 .


 
  is the usual Hardy space on the open upper half plane.

Definition 2
A de Branges space can also be defined as all entire functions F satisfying all of the following conditions:








As Hilbert spaces
Given a de Branges space B(E). Define the scalar product:



A de Branges space with such a scalar product can be proven to be a Hilbert space.
