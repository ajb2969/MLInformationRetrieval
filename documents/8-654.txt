   Elementary matrix      Elementary matrix   In mathematics , an elementary matrix is a matrix which differs from the identity matrix by one single elementary row operation. The elementary matrices generate the general linear group of invertible matrices . Left multiplication (pre-multiplication) by an elementary matrix represents elementary row operations , while right multiplication (post-multiplication) represents elementary column operations . The acronym "ERO" is commonly used for "elementary row operations".  Elementary row operations are used in Gaussian elimination to reduce a matrix to row echelon form . They are also used in Gauss-Jordan elimination to further reduce the matrix to reduced row echelon form .  Operations  There are three types of elementary matrices, which correspond to three types of row operations (respectively, column operations):   Row switching: A row within the matrix can be switched with another row.       R  i   ↔   R  j      normal-↔   subscript  R  i    subscript  R  j     R_{i}\leftrightarrow R_{j}       Row multiplication: Each element in a row can be multiplied by a non-zero constant.        k   R  i    →   R  i    ,    where  k   ≠  0      formulae-sequence   normal-→    k   subscript  R  i     subscript  R  i        where  k   0     kR_{i}\rightarrow R_{i},\ \mbox{where }k\neq 0       Row addition: A row can be replaced by the sum of that row and a multiple of another row.         R  i   +   k   R  j     →   R  i    ,    where  i   ≠  j      formulae-sequence   normal-→     subscript  R  i     k   subscript  R  j      subscript  R  i        where  i   j     R_{i}+kR_{j}\rightarrow R_{i},\mbox{where }i\neq j      If E is an elementary matrix, as described below, to apply the elementary row operation to a matrix A , one multiplies the elementary matrix on the left, E⋅A . The elementary matrix for any row operation is obtained by executing the operation on the identity matrix .  Row-switching transformations  The first type of row operation on a matrix A switches all matrix elements on row i with their counterparts on row j . The corresponding elementary matrix is obtained by swapping row i and row j of the identity matrix .        T   i  ,  j    =   [     1                              ⋱                              0       1                     ⋱                        1       0                              ⋱                              1     ]         subscript  T   i  j      1  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  normal-⋱  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  0  absent  1  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  1  absent  0  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱  absent    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  1      T_{i,j}=\begin{bmatrix}1&&&&&&&\\
 &\ddots&&&&&&\\
 &&0&&1&&\\
 &&&\ddots&&&&\\
 &&1&&0&&\\
 &&&&&&\ddots&\\
 &&&&&&&1\end{bmatrix}\quad      So T ij ⋅A is the matrix produced by exchanging row i and row j of A .   Properties  :*The inverse of this matrix is itself: T ij −1 =T ij .  :*Since the determinant of the identity matrix is unity, det[ T ij ] = −1. It follows that for any square matrix A (of the correct size), we have det[ T ij A ] = −det[ A ].  Row-multiplying transformations  The next type of row operation on a matrix A multiplies all elements on row i by m where m is a non-zero scalar (usually a real number). The corresponding elementary matrix is a diagonal matrix, with diagonal entries 1 everywhere except in the i th position, where it is m .         T  i    (  m  )    =   [     1                           ⋱                           1                           m                           1                           ⋱                           1     ]           subscript  T  i   m     1  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  normal-⋱  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  1  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  m  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  absent  1  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱  absent    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  1      T_{i}(m)=\begin{bmatrix}1&&&&&&\\
 &\ddots&&&&&\\
 &&1&&&&\\
 &&&m&&&\\
 &&&&1&&\\
 &&&&&\ddots&\\
 &&&&&&1\end{bmatrix}\quad      So T i (m)⋅A is the matrix produced from A by multiplying row i by m .   Properties  :*The inverse of this matrix is: T i ( m ) −1 = T i (1/ m ).  :*The matrix and its inverse are diagonal matrices .  :*det[ T i (m)] = m . Therefore for a square matrix A (of the correct size), we have det[ T i ( m ) A ] = m det[ A ].  Row-addition transformations  The final type of row operation on a matrix A adds row j multiplied by a scalar m to row i . The corresponding elementary matrix is the identity matrix but with an m in the ( i,j ) position.        T   i  ,  j     (  m  )    =   [     1                              ⋱                              1                              ⋱                        m       1                              ⋱                              1     ]          subscript  T   i  j    m     1  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  normal-⋱  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  1  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱  absent  absent  absent  absent    absent  absent  m  absent  1  absent  absent    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  normal-⋱  absent    absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  absent  1      T_{i,j}(m)=\begin{bmatrix}1&&&&&&&\\
 &\ddots&&&&&&\\
 &&1&&&&&\\
 &&&\ddots&&&&\\
 &&m&&1&&\\
 &&&&&&\ddots&\\
 &&&&&&&1\end{bmatrix}      So T i,j (m)⋅A is the matrix produced from A by adding m times row j to row i .   Properties  :*These transformations are a kind of shear mapping , also known as a transvections .  :* T ij ( m ) −1 = T ij (− m ) (inverse matrix).  :*The matrix and its inverse are triangular matrices .  :*det[ T ij ( m )] = 1. Therefore, for a square matrix A (of the correct size) we have det[ T ij ( m ) A ] = det[ A ].  :*Row-addition transforms satisfy the Steinberg relations .
