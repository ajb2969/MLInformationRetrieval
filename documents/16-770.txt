   BzK galaxy      BzK galaxy   In astrophysics, a BzK galaxy is a galaxy that has been selected as star-forming or passive based on its photometry in the B, z, and K photometric bands .  The selection criteria, as originally defined, 1 are as follows:   Star-forming BzK (sBzK) galaxies satisfy     B  z  K   ≡     (   z  -  K   )    A  B    -    (   B  -  z   )    A  B     ≥   -  0.2           B  z  K      subscript    z  K     A  B     subscript    B  z     A  B            0.2      BzK\equiv(z-K)_{AB}-(B-z)_{AB}\geq-0.2     Passive BzK (pBzK) galaxies satisfy     B  z  K   <   -  0.2         B  z  K     0.2     BzK<-0.2   and      (   z  -  K   )    A  B    >  2.5       subscript    z  K     A  B    2.5    (z-K)_{AB}>2.5      See also   Lyman-break galaxy   References  "  Category:Galaxies     ↩
