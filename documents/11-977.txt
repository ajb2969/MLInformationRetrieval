   Quinate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase      Quinate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase   In enzymology , a quinate O-hydroxycinnamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   feruloyl-CoA + quinate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + O-feruloylquinate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are feruloyl-CoA and quinate , whereas its two products are CoA and O-feruloylquinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is feruloyl-CoA:quinate O-(hydroxycinnamoyl)transferase . This enzyme is also called hydroxycinnamoyl coenzyme A-quinate transferase . This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis .  References       "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Hydroxycinnamic acids metabolism
