The Cartesian product of an n -polytope and an m -polytope is an ( n + m )-polytope, where n and m are 2 ( polygon ) or higher.  The lowest-dimensional duoprisms exist in 4-dimensional space as 4-polytopes being the Cartesian product of two polygons in 2-dimensional Euclidean space . More precisely, it is the set of points:        P  1   ×   P  2    =   {   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  ,  w  )   |     (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   P  1    ,    (  z  ,  w  )   ∈   P  2     }          subscript  P  1    subscript  P  2     conditional-set   x  y  z  w    formulae-sequence     x  y    subscript  P  1       z  w    subscript  P  2        P_{1}\times P_{2}=\{(x,y,z,w)|(x,y)\in P_{1},(z,w)\in P_{2}\}     where P 1 and P 2 are the sets of the points contained in the respective polygons. Such a duoprism is convex if both bases are convex, and is bounded by prismatic cells .  Nomenclature  Four-dimensional duoprisms are considered to be prismatic 4-polytopes. A duoprism constructed from two regular polygons of the same edge length is a uniform duoprism .  A duoprism made of n -polygons and m -polygons is named by prefixing 'duoprism' with the names of the base polygons, for example: a triangular-pentagonal duoprism is the Cartesian product of a triangle and a pentagon.  An alternative, more concise way of specifying a particular duoprism is by prefixing with numbers denoting the base polygons, for example: 3,5-duoprism for the triangular-pentagonal duoprism.  Other alternative names:   q -gonal- p -gonal prism  q -gonal- p -gonal double prism  q -gonal- p -gonal hyperprism   The term duoprism is coined by George Olshevsky , shortened from double prism . John Horton Conway proposed a similar name proprism for product prism , a Cartesian product of two or more polytopes of dimension at least two. The duoprisms are proprisms formed from exactly two polytopes.  Example 16-16 duoprism      Schlegel diagram  Projection from the center of one 16-gonal prism, and all but one of the opposite 16-gonal prisms are shown.   net  The two sets of 16-gonal prisms are shown. The top and bottom faces of the vertical cylinder are connected when folded together in 4D.     Geometry of 4-dimensional duoprisms  A 4-dimensional uniform duoprism is created by the product of a regular n -sided polygon and a regular m -sided polygon with the same edge length. It is bounded by n  m -gonal prisms and m  n -gonal prisms. For example, the Cartesian product of a triangle and a hexagon is a duoprism bounded by 6 triangular prisms and 3 hexagonal prisms.   When m and n are identical, the resulting duoprism is bounded by 2 n identical n -gonal prisms. For example, the Cartesian product of two triangles is a duoprism bounded by 6 triangular prisms.    When m and n are identically 4, the resulting duoprism is bounded by 8 square prisms ( cubes ), and is identical to the tesseract .   The m -gonal prisms are attached to each other via their m -gonal faces, and form a closed loop. Similarly, the n -gonal prisms are attached to each other via their n -gonal faces, and form a second loop perpendicular to the first. These two loops are attached to each other via their square faces, and are mutually perpendicular.  As m and n approach infinity, the corresponding duoprisms approach the duocylinder . As such, duoprisms are useful as non- quadric approximations of the duocylinder.

Similarly a 6-6 duoprism projected into 3D approximates a torus , hexagonal both in plan and in section.     The p-q duoprisms are identical to the q-p duoprisms, but look different in these projections because they are projected in the center of different cells.

There are n vertices projected into the center. For 4,4, it represents the A 3 Coxeter plane of the tesseract . The 5,5 projection is identical to the 3D rhombic triacontahedron .

The 2 n  n -gonal faces can be seen as removed. (skew polyhedra can be seen in the same way by a n-m duoprism, but these are not regular .)  {{-}}  Duoantiprism  Like the antiprisms as alternated prisms , there is a set of 4-dimensional duoantiprisms: 4-polytopes that can be created by an alternation operation applied to a duoprism. The alternated vertices create nonregular tetrahedral cells, except for the special case, the 4-4 duoprism ( tesseract ) which creates the uniform (and regular) 16-cell . The 16-cell is the only convex uniform duoantiprism.  The duoprisms , t 0,1,2,3 {p,2,q}, can be alternated into , ht 0,1,2,3 {p,2,q}, the "duoantiprisms", which cannot be made uniform in general. The only convex uniform solution is the trivial case of p=q=2, which is a lower symmetry construction of the tesseract , t 0,1,2,3 {2,2,2}, with its alternation as the 16-cell , , s{2}s{2}.  The only nonconvex uniform solution is p=5, q=5/3, ht 0,1,2,3 {5,2,5/3}, , constructed from 10 pentagonal antiprisms , 10 pentagrammic crossed-antiprisms , and 50 tetrahedra, known as the great duoantiprism (gudap). 1 2  k_22 polytopes  The 3-3 duoprism , -1 22 , is first in a dimensional series of uniform polytopes, expressed by Coxeter as k 22 series. The 3-3 duoprism is the vertex figure for the second, the birectified 5-simplex . The fourth figure is a Euclidean honeycomb, 2 22 , and the final is a paracompact hyperbolic honeycomb, 3 22 , with Coxeter group [3 2,2,3 ],     T  ¯   7     subscript   normal-¯  T   7    {\bar{T}}_{7}   . Each progressive uniform polytope is constructed from the previous as its vertex figure .
