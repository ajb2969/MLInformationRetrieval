   Quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase      Quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a quinoprotein glucose dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucose + ubiquinone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucono-1,5-lactone + ubiquinol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glucose and ubiquinone , whereas its two products are D-glucono-1,5-lactone and ubiquinol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with a quinone or similar compound as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucose:ubiquinone oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include D-glucose:(pyrroloquinoline-quinone) 1-oxidoreductase , glucose dehydrogenase (PQQ-dependent) , glucose dehydrogenase (pyrroloquinoline-quinone) , and quinoprotein D-glucose dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway . It employs one cofactor , PQQ .  References          External links    The CAS registry number for this enzyme class is 81669-60-5.
