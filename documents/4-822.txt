   Ramanujan graph      Ramanujan graph   In spectral graph theory , a Ramanujan graph , named after Srinivasa Ramanujan , is a regular  graph whose spectral gap is almost as large as possible (see extremal graph theory ). Such graphs are excellent spectral expanders .  Examples of Ramanujan graphs include the clique , the biclique     K   n  ,  n      subscript  K   n  n     K_{n,n}   , and the Petersen graph . As Murty's survey paper notes, Ramanujan graphs "fuse diverse branches of pure mathematics, namely, number theory , representation theory , and algebraic geometry ". As observed by Toshikazu Sunada , a regular graph is Ramanujan if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analog of the Riemann hypothesis . 1  Definition  Let   G   G   G   be a connected   d   d   d   -regular graph with   n   n   n   vertices, and let     λ  0   ≥   λ  1   ≥  …  ≥   λ   n  -  1           subscript  λ  0    subscript  λ  1        normal-…        subscript  λ    n  1       \lambda_{0}\geq\lambda_{1}\geq\ldots\geq\lambda_{n-1}   be the eigenvalues of the adjacency matrix of   G   G   G   . Because   G   G   G   is connected and   d   d   d   -regular, its eigenvalues satisfy    d  =   λ  0   >   λ  1         d   subscript  λ  0         subscript  λ  1      d=\lambda_{0}>\lambda_{1}        ≥  …  ≥   λ   n  -  1    ≥   -  d         absent  normal-…        subscript  λ    n  1           d      \geq\ldots\geq\lambda_{n-1}\geq-d   . Whenever there exists    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   with     |   λ  i   |   <  d         subscript  λ  i    d    |\lambda_{i}|   , define        λ   (  G  )    =    max    |   λ  i   |   <  d     |   λ  i   |     .        λ  G     subscript        subscript  λ  i    d       subscript  λ  i       \lambda(G)=\max_{|\lambda_{i}|     A   d   d   d   -regular graph   G   G   G   is a Ramanujan graph if     λ   (  G  )    ≤   2    d  -  1           λ  G     2      d  1       \lambda(G)\leq 2\sqrt{d-1}   .  A Ramanujan graph is characterized as a regular graph whose Ihara zeta function satisfies an analogue of the Riemann Hypothesis .  Extremality of Ramanujan graphs  For a fixed   d   d   d   and large   n   n   n   , the   d   d   d   -regular,   n   n   n   -vertex Ramanujan graphs nearly minimize    λ   (  G  )       λ  G    \lambda(G)   . If   G   G   G   is a   d   d   d   -regular graph with diameter    m   m   m   , a theorem due to Nilli 2 states        λ  1   ≥    2    d  -  1     -     2    d  -  1     -  1    ⌊   m  /  2   ⌋      .       subscript  λ  1       2      d  1           2      d  1     1       m  2        \lambda_{1}\geq 2\sqrt{d-1}-\frac{2\sqrt{d-1}-1}{\lfloor m/2\rfloor}.     Whenever   G   G   G   is   d   d   d   -regular and connected on at least three vertices,     |   λ  1   |   <  d         subscript  λ  1    d    |\lambda_{1}|   , and therefore     λ   (  G  )    ≥   λ  1         λ  G    subscript  λ  1     \lambda(G)\geq\lambda_{1}   . Let    𝒢  n  d     superscript   subscript  𝒢  n   d    \mathcal{G}_{n}^{d}   be the set of all connected   d   d   d   -regular graphs   G   G   G   with at least   n   n   n   vertices. Because the minimum diameter of graphs in    𝒢  n  d     superscript   subscript  𝒢  n   d    \mathcal{G}_{n}^{d}   approaches infinity for fixed   d   d   d   and increasing   n   n   n   , Nilli's theorem implies an earlier theorem of Alon and Boppana which states         lim   n  →  ∞      inf   G  ∈   𝒢  n  d      λ   (  G  )      ≥   2    d  -  1      .        subscript    normal-→  n       subscript  infimum    G   superscript   subscript  𝒢  n   d       λ  G       2      d  1       \lim_{n\to\infty}\inf_{G\in\mathcal{G}_{n}^{d}}\lambda(G)\geq 2\sqrt{d-1}.     Constructions  Constructions of Ramanujan graphs are often algebraic. Lubotzky , Phillips and Sarnak show how to construct an infinite family of p +1-regular Ramanujan graphs, whenever p ≡ 1 (mod 4) is a prime . Their proof uses the Ramanujan conjecture , which led to the name of Ramanujan graphs. Morgenstern extended the construction of Lubotzky, Phillips and Sarnak to all prime powers. Adam Marcus, Daniel Spielman and Nikhil Srivastava showed an explicit construction of   d   d   d   -regular Ramanujan graphs for any   d   d   d   .
