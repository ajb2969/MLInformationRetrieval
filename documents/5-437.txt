   Gravitational anomaly      Gravitational anomaly   In theoretical physics , a gravitational anomaly is an example of a gauge anomaly : it is an effect of quantum mechanics –usually a one-loop diagram —that invalidates the general covariance of a theory of general relativity combined with some other fields. The adjective "gravitational" is derived from the symmetry of a gravitational theory, namely from general covariance. A gravitational anomaly is generally synonmous with diffeomorphism anomaly , since general covariance is symmetry under coordinate reparametrization; i.e. diffeomorphism .  General covariance is the basis of general relativity , the current theory of gravitation . Moreover, it is necessary for the consistency of any theory of quantum gravity , since it is required in order to cancel unphysical degrees of freedom with a negative norm, namely gravitons polarized along the time direction. Therefore all gravitational anomalies must cancel out.  The anomaly usually appears as a Feynman diagram with a chiral  fermion running in the loop (a polygon) with n external gravitons attached to the loop where    n  =   1  +   D  /  2        n    1    D  2      n=1+D/2   where   D   D   D   is the spacetime dimension. Field-theoretic pure gravitational anomalies occur only in even spacetime dimensions. 1 However, diffeomorphism anomalies can occur in the case of an odd-dimensional spacetime manifold with boundary. 2  See also   Gravity anomaly , a different concept in geodesy and geophysics dealing with differences between observed values of gravity and predicted values for that location  Mixed anomaly  Green-Schwarz mechanism   References     "  Category:Anomalies in physics  Category:Quantum gravity     ↩
