   18S rRNA (adenine1779-N6/adenine1780-N6)-dimethyltransferase      18S rRNA (adenine1779-N6/adenine1780-N6)-dimethyltransferase   18S rRNA (adenine 1779 -N 6 /adenine 1780 -N 6 )-dimethyltransferase (, 18S rRNA dimethylase Dim1p , Dim1p , ScDim1 , m2(6)A dimethylase , KIDIM1 ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:18S rRNA (adenine 1779 -N 6 /adenine 1780 -N6)-dimethyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   4 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 1779 / adenine 1780 in 18S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 6 -dimethyladenine 1779 /N 6 -dimethyladenine 1780 in 18S rRNA   DIM1 is involved in pre-rRNA processing.
