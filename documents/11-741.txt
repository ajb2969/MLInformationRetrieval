   Mimosinase      Mimosinase   In enzymology , a mimosinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyridin-1-yl)propanoate + H 2 O $\rightleftharpoons$ 3-hydroxy-4H-pyrid-4-one + L-serine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2-amino-3-(3-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyridin-1-yl)propanoate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 3-hydroxy-4H-pyrid-4-one and L-serine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is mimosine amidohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
