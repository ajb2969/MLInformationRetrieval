   Ba space      Ba space   In mathematics , the ba space     b  a   (  Σ  )       b  a  normal-Σ    ba(\Sigma)   of an algebra of sets    Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   is the Banach space consisting of all bounded and finitely additive signed measures on   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   . The norm is defined as the variation , that is      ∥  ν  ∥   =    |  ν  |    (  X  )     .       norm  ν       ν   X     \|\nu\|=|\nu|(X).     If Σ is a sigma-algebra , then the space    c  a   (  Σ  )       c  a  normal-Σ    ca(\Sigma)   is defined as the subset of    b  a   (  Σ  )       b  a  normal-Σ    ba(\Sigma)   consisting of countably additive measures .  The notation ba is a mnemonic for bounded additive and ca is short for countably additive .  If X is a topological space , and Σ is the sigma-algebra of Borel sets in X , then    r  c  a   (  X  )       r  c  a  X    rca(X)   is the subspace of    c  a   (  Σ  )       c  a  normal-Σ    ca(\Sigma)   consisting of all regular  Borel measures on X .  Properties  All three spaces are complete (they are Banach spaces ) with respect to the same norm defined by the total variation, and thus    c  a   (  Σ  )       c  a  normal-Σ    ca(\Sigma)   is a closed subset of    b  a   (  Σ  )       b  a  normal-Σ    ba(\Sigma)   , and    r  c  a   (  X  )       r  c  a  X    rca(X)   is a closed set of    c  a   (  Σ  )       c  a  normal-Σ    ca(\Sigma)   for Σ the algebra of Borel sets on X . The space of simple functions on   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   is dense in    b  a   (  Σ  )       b  a  normal-Σ    ba(\Sigma)   .  The ba space of the power set of the natural numbers , ba (2 N ), is often denoted as simply    b  a      b  a    ba   and is isomorphic to the dual space of the ℓ ∞ space .  Dual of B(Σ)  Let B(Σ) be the space of bounded Σ-measurable functions, equipped with the uniform norm . Then ba (Σ) = B(Σ)* is the continuous dual space of B(Σ). This is due to  and . This is a kind of Riesz representation theorem which allows for a measure to be represented as a linear functional on measurable functions. In particular, this isomorphism allows one to define the integral with respect to a finitely additive measure (note that the usual Lebesgue integral requires countable additivity). This is due to , and is often used to define the integral with respect to vector measures , and especially vector-valued Radon measures .  The topological duality ba (Σ) = B(Σ)* is easy to see. There is an obvious algebraic duality between the vector space of all finitely additive measures σ on Σ and the vector space of simple functions (     μ   (  A  )    =   ζ   (   1  A   )          μ  A     ζ   subscript  1  A      \mu(A)=\zeta\left(1_{A}\right)   ). It is easy to check that the linear form induced by σ is continuous in the sup-norm iff σ is bounded, and the result follows since a linear form on the dense subspace of simple functions extends to an element of B(Σ)* iff it is continuous in the sup-norm.  Dual of L ∞ ( μ )  If Σ is a sigma-algebra and μ is a sigma-additive positive measure on Σ then the Lp space  L ∞ ( μ ) endowed with the essential supremum norm is by definition the quotient space of B(Σ) by the closed subspace of bounded μ -null functions:        N  μ   :=   {   f  ∈   B   (  Σ  )     :   f  =    0   μ  -almost everywhere    }    .     assign   subscript  N  μ    conditional-set    f    B  normal-Σ      f    0  μ  -almost everywhere       N_{\mu}:=\{f\in B(\Sigma):f=0\ \mu\text{-almost everywhere}\}.   The dual Banach space L ∞ ( μ )* is thus isomorphic to        N  μ  ⟂   =   {   σ  ∈   b  a   (  Σ  )     :    μ   (  A  )    =  0  ⇒   σ   (  A  )    =   0  for any  A   ∈  Σ   }    ,       superscript   subscript  N  μ   perpendicular-to    conditional-set    σ    b  a  normal-Σ          μ  A   0    normal-⇒      σ  A          0  for any  A        normal-Σ       N_{\mu}^{\perp}=\{\sigma\in ba(\Sigma):\mu(A)=0\Rightarrow\sigma(A)=0\text{ %
 for any }A\in\Sigma\},   i.e. the space of finitely additive signed measures on Σ that are absolutely continuous with respect to μ ( μ -a.c. for short).  When the measure space is furthermore sigma-finite then L ∞ ( μ ) is in turn dual to L 1 ( μ ), which by the Radon–Nikodym theorem is identified with the set of all countably additive  μ -a.c. measures. In other words the inclusion in the bidual        L  1    (  μ  )    ⊂    L  1     (  μ  )     *  *     =    L  ∞     (  μ  )   *             superscript  L  1   μ      superscript  L  1    superscript  μ    absent              superscript  L     superscript  μ        L^{1}(\mu)\subset L^{1}(\mu)^{**}=L^{\infty}(\mu)^{*}   is isomorphic to the inclusion of the space of countably additive μ -a.c. bounded measures inside the space of all finitely additive μ -a.c. bounded measures.
