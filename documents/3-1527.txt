   Octagonal number      Octagonal number   An octagonal number is a figurate number that represents an octagon . The octagonal number for n is given by the formula 3 n 2 - 2 n , with n > 0. The first few octagonal numbers are:  1 , 8 , 21 , 40 , 65 , 96 , 133 , 176 , 225, 280 , 341, 408, 481, 560, 645, 736, 833, 936  Octagonal numbers can be formed by placing triangular numbers on the four sides of a square. To put it algebraically, the n -th octagonal number is        x  n   =    n  2   +   4    ∑   k  =  1    n  -  1    k     =    3   n  2    -   2  n     .         subscript  x  n      superscript  n  2     4    superscript   subscript     k  1      n  1    k              3   superscript  n  2      2  n       x_{n}=n^{2}+4\sum_{k=1}^{n-1}k=3n^{2}-2n.     The octagonal number for n can also be calculated by adding the square of n to twice the ( n - 1 )th pronic number .  Octagonal numbers consistently alternate parity .  Octagonal numbers are occasionally referred to as " star numbers ," though that term is more commonly used to refer to centered dodecagonal numbers. 1  Test for octagonal numbers  Solving the formula for the n -th octagonal number,     x  n   ,     subscript  x  n    x_{n},   for n gives       n  =       3   x  n    +  1    +  1   3    .      n            3   subscript  x  n    1    1   3     n=\frac{\sqrt{3x_{n}+1}+1}{3}.   An arbitrary number x can be checked for octagonality by putting it in this equation. If n is an integer, then x is the n -th octagonal number. If n is not an integer, then x is not octagonal.
