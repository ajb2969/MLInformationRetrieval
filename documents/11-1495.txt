   Glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase      Glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase   In enzymology , a glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CTP + alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + CDP-glucose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CTP and alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are diphosphate and CDP-glucose . 1 2  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is CTP:alpha-D-glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase . Other names in common use include CDP glucose pyrophosphorylase , cytidine diphosphoglucose pyrophosphorylase , cytidine diphosphate glucose pyrophosphorylase , cytidine diphosphate-D-glucose pyrophosphorylase , and CTP:D-glucose-1-phosphate cytidylyltransferase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism and nucleotide sugars metabolism . 3  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
