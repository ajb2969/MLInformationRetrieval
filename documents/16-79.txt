Alpha-eudesmol synthase

Alpha-eudesmol synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (alpha-eudesmol-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  alpha-eudesmol + diphosphate


The recombinant enzyme from ginger (Zingiber zerumbet) gives beta-eudesmol, 10-epi-gamma-eudesmol, alpha-eudesmol and aristolene.
