Diphosphoinositol-polyphosphate diphosphatase




Diphosphoinositol-polyphosphate diphosphatase

In enzymology, a diphosphoinositol-polyphosphate diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

diphospho-myo-inositol polyphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  myo-inositol polyphosphate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are diphospho-myo-inositol polyphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are myo-inositol polyphosphate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is diphospho-myo-inositol-polyphosphate diphosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include diphosphoinositol-polyphosphate phosphohydrolase, and DIPP.
