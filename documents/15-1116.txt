   Dimethyl-sulfide monooxygenase      Dimethyl-sulfide monooxygenase   Dimethyl-sulfide monooxygenase (, dimethylsulfide monooxygenase ) is an enzyme with system name dimethyl sulfide,NADH:oxygen oxidoreductase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   dimethyl sulfide + O 2 + NADH + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    methanethiol + formaldehyde + NAD + + H 2 O   Dimethyl-sulfide monooxygenase has lower activity with diethyl sulfide and other short-chain alkyl methyl sulfides. 2 3  References  External links     "  Category:EC 1.14.13     ↩  ↩  ↩
