Generalized Pareto distribution

In statistics, the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) is a family of continuous probability distributions. It is often used to model the tails of another distribution. It is specified by three parameters: location 
 
 
 
 , scale 
 
 
 
 , and shape 
 
 
 
 .12 Sometimes it is specified by only scale and shape3 and sometimes only by its shape parameter. Some references give the shape parameter as 
 
 
 
 .4
Definition
The standard cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the GPD is defined by5



where the support is 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .



Differential equation
The cdf of the GPD is a solution of the following differential equation:



Characterization
The related location-scale family of distributions is obtained by replacing the argument z by 
 
 
 
 
  and adjusting the support accordingly: The cumulative distribution function is



for 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .
The probability density function (pdf) is


 
 ,
or equivalently


 
 ,
again, for 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  when 
 
 
 
 .
The pdf is a solution of the following differential equation:



Characteristic and Moment Generating Functions
The characteristic  and moment generating functions are derived and skewness and kurtosis are obtained from MGF by Muraleedharan and Guedes Soares6
Special cases

If the shape 
 
 
 
  and location 
 
 
 
  are both zero, the GPD is equivalent to the exponential distribution.
With shape 
 
 
 
  and location 
 
 
 
 , the GPD is equivalent to the Pareto distribution with scale 
 
 
 
  and shape 
 
 
 
 .

Generating generalized Pareto random variables
If U is uniformly distributed on (0, 1], then


 
  and



Both formulas are obtained by inversion of the cdf.
In Matlab Statistics Toolbox, you can easily use "gprnd" command to generate generalized Pareto random numbers.
With GNU R you can use the packages POT or evd with the "rgpd" command (see for exact usage: http://rss.acs.unt.edu/Rdoc/library/POT/html/simGPD.html)
