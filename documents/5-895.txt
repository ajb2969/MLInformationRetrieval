   Inversive congruential generator      Inversive congruential generator   Inversive congruential generators are a type of nonlinear congruential pseudorandom number generator , which use the modular multiplicative inverse (if it exists) to generate the next number in a sequence. The standard formula for an inversive congruential generator, modulo some prime q is:             x  0   =        subscript  x  0   absent    x_{0}=   seed           x   i  +  1    ≡    (    a   x  i   -  1     +  c   )   mod  q        subscript  x    i  1     modulo      a   superscript   subscript  x  i     1     c   q     x_{i+1}\equiv(ax_{i}^{-1}+c)\mod q      | if     x  i   ≠  0       subscript  x  i   0    x_{i}\neq 0             x   i  +  1    =  c       subscript  x    i  1    c    x_{i+1}=c      if     x  i   =  0       subscript  x  i   0    x_{i}=0          Such a generator is denoted symbolically as ICG(q,a,c,seed) and is said to be an ICG with parameters q , a , c and seed seed .  Period  The sequence     (   x  n   )    n  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  x  n     n  0     (x_{n})_{n\geq 0}   must have     x  i   =   x  j        subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j     x_{i}=x_{j}   after finitely many steps and since the next element depends only on its direct predecessor also     x   i  +  1    =   x   j  +  1         subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x    j  1      x_{i+1}=x_{j+1}   etc. The maximum length that the period  T for a function modulo q can have is . If the polynomial      f   (  x  )    =    x  2   -   c  x   -  a   ∈    𝔽  q    [  x  ]            f  x      superscript  x  2     c  x   a           subscript  𝔽  q    delimited-[]  x       f(x)=x^{2}-cx-a\in\mathbb{F}_{q}[x]   (polynomial ring over    𝔽  q     subscript  𝔽  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   ) is primitive , then the sequence will have the maximum length. Such polynomials are called inversive maximal period (IMP) polynomials. The sufficient condition for maximum sequence period is a proper choice of parameters a and c according to the algorithm described in. 1 Eichenauer-Herrmann, Lehn, Grothe and Niederreiter have shown that inversive congruential generators have good uniformity properties, in particular with regard to lattice structure and serial correlations.  Example  ICG(5,2,3,1) gives the sequence:(1,0,3,2,4,1,.....) (as in     ∈   𝔽  5       absent   subscript  𝔽  5     \in\mathbb{F}_{5}   , 1 and 4 are their own inverse, 2 is the inverse of 3 and conversely). In this example     f   (  x  )    =    x  2   -   3  x   -  2         f  x      superscript  x  2     3  x   2     f(x)=x^{2}-3x-2   is irreducible in     𝔽  5    [  x  ]        subscript  𝔽  5    delimited-[]  x     \mathbb{F}_{5}[x]   as neither 0,1,2,3 or 4 are roots, and therefore the period is equal to .In order to show that f is primitive one should show that x is a primitive element of      𝔽  5    [  x  ]    /   (  f  )          subscript  𝔽  5    delimited-[]  x    f    \mathbb{F}_{5}[x]/(f)   .  Compound Inversive Generator  The construction of a Compound Inversive Generator (CIG) relies on combining two or more congruential inversive generators according to the method described below.  Let     p  1   ,  …  ,   p  r       subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  r     p_{1},\dots,p_{r}   be distinct prime integers, each     p  j   ≥  5       subscript  p  j   5    p_{j}\geq 5   . For each index j,1≤ j ≤ r, let     (   x  n   )    n  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  x  n     n  0     (x_{n})_{n\geq 0}   be a sequence of elements of     ∈   𝔽   p  j        absent   subscript  𝔽   subscript  p  j      \in\mathbb{F}_{p_{j}}   , that is periodic with period length    p  j     subscript  p  j    p_{j}   . In other words,     {   x  n   (  j  )    |  0  ≤  n  ≤   p  j   }   =  ∈   𝔽   p  j       fragments   fragments  normal-{   superscript   subscript  x  n   j   normal-|  0   n    subscript  p  j   normal-}      subscript  𝔽   subscript  p  j      \{x_{n}^{(j)}|0\leq n\leq p_{j}\}=\in\mathbb{F}_{p_{j}}   .  For each index j, 1≤ j ≤ r, we consider     T  j   =   T  /   p  j         subscript  T  j     T   subscript  p  j      T_{j}=T/p_{j}   where    T  =    p  1   ⋯   p  r        T     subscript  p  1   normal-⋯   subscript  p  r      T=p_{1}\cdots p_{r}   is the period length of the following sequence     (   x  n   )    n  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  x  n     n  0     (x_{n})_{n\geq 0}   .  The sequence     (   x  n   )    n  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  x  n     n  0     (x_{n})_{n\geq 0}   of compound pseudorandom numbers is defined as the sum       x  n   =      T  1    x  n   (  1  )     +    T  2    x  n   (  2  )     +  …  +    T  r    x  n   (  r  )      mod  T        subscript  x  n    modulo       subscript  T  1    superscript   subscript  x  n   1       subscript  T  2    superscript   subscript  x  n   2    normal-…     subscript  T  r    superscript   subscript  x  n   r     T     x_{n}=T_{1}x_{n}^{(1)}+T_{2}x_{n}^{(2)}+\dots+T_{r}x_{n}^{(r)}\mod T   . The compound approach allows combining Inversive Congruential Generators, provided they have full period, in parallel generation systems.  Example  Let     p  1   =  5       subscript  p  1   5    p_{1}=5   and     p  2   =  7   (  r  =  2  )      fragments   subscript  p  2    7   fragments  normal-(  r   2  normal-)     p_{2}=7(r=2)   . To simplify, take      (   x  n   (  1  )    )    n  ≥  0    =   (  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  …  )        subscript   superscript   subscript  x  n   1     n  0     0  1  2  3  4  normal-…     (x_{n}^{(1)})_{n\geq 0}=(0,1,2,3,4,\dots)   and      (   x  n   (  2  )    )    n  ≥  0    =   (  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  5  ,  6  ,  …  )        subscript   superscript   subscript  x  n   2     n  0     0  1  2  3  4  5  6  normal-…     (x_{n}^{(2)})_{n\geq 0}=(0,1,2,3,4,5,6,\dots)   . We compute for every 1≤ j≤ 35,     x  j   =     7   x  j   (  1  )     +   5   x  j   (  2  )      mod  35        subscript  x  j    modulo      7   superscript   subscript  x  j   1      5   superscript   subscript  x  j   2     35     x_{j}=7x_{j}^{(1)}+5x_{j}^{(2)}\mod 35   then      (   x  n   )    n  ≥  0    =   (  0  ,  12  ,  24  ,  1  ,  13  ,  25  ,  2  ,  14  ,  26  ,  3  ,  15  ,  27  ,  4  ,  16  ,  28  ,  5  ,  17  ,  29  ,  6  ,  18  ,  30  ,  7  ,  19  ,  31  ,  8  ,  20  ,  32  ,  9  ,  21  ,  33  ,  10  ,  22  ,  34  ,  11  ,  23  )        subscript   subscript  x  n     n  0     0  12  24  1  13  25  2  14  26  3  15  27  4  16  28  5  17  29  6  18  30  7  19  31  8  20  32  9  21  33  10  22  34  11  23     (x_{n})_{n\geq 0}=(0,12,24,1,13,25,2,14,26,3,15,27,4,16,28,5,17,29,6,18,30,7,1%
 9,31,8,20,32,9,21,33,10,22,34,11,23)   (we have to do the 35 different sums to obtain 0+0 and we begin the same sequence again, the period is     5  ×  7   =   35         5  7   35    5\times 7=35\,   ). This method allows obtaining very long period and modular operations may be carried out with relatively small moduli.  Advantages of CIG  The CIG are accepted for practical purposes for a number of reason.  Firstly, binary sequences produced in this way are free of undesirable statistical deviations. Inversive sequences extensively tested with variety of statistical tests remain stable under the variation of parameter. 2 3 4  Secondly, there exists a steady and simple way of parameter choice, based on the Chou algorithm 5 that guarantees maximum period length.  Thirdly, compound approach has the same properties as single inversive generators 6 7 but it also provides period length significantly greater than obtained by a single Inversive Congruential Generator. They seem to be designed for application with multiprocessor parallel hardware platforms.  There exists an algorithm 8 which allows designing compound generators with predictable period length, predictable linear complexity level, with excellent statistical properties of produced bit streams.  The procedure of designing this complex structure starts with defining finite field of p elements and ends with choosing the parameters a and c for each Inversive Congruential Generator being the component of the compound generator. It means that each generator is associated to a fixed IMP polynomial. Such a condition is sufficient for maximum period of each Inversive Congruential Generator 9 and finally for maximum period of the compound generator. The construction of IMP polynomials is the most efficient approach to find parameters for Inversive Congruential Generator with maximum period length.  Discrepancy and its boundaries  Equidistribution and statistical independence properties of the generated sequences, which are very important for their usability in a stochastic simulation , can be analyzed based on the discrepancy of s-tuples of successive pseudorandom numbers with    s  =  1      s  1    s=1   and    s  =  2      s  2    s=2   respectively.  The discrepancy computes the distance of a generator from a uniform one, a low discrepancy means that the sequence generated can be used for cryptographic purposes and the first aim of the Inversive congruential generator is to provide pseudorandom numbers.

These two theorems show that the CIG is not perfect because the discrepancy is greater strictly than a positive value but also the CIG is not the worst generator as the discrepancy is lower than a value less than 1.  There exist also theorems which bound the average value of the discrepancy for Compound Inversive Generators and also ones which take values such that the discrepancy is bounded by some value depending on the parameters.
