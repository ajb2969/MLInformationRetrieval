   Equally spaced polynomial      Equally spaced polynomial   An equally spaced polynomial (ESP) is a polynomial used in finite fields , specifically GF(2) ( binary ).  An s-ESP of degree sm can be written as:       E  S  P   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   m    x   s  i           E  S  P  x     superscript   subscript     i  0    m    superscript  x    s  i       ESP(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{m}x^{si}   for    i  =   0  ,  1  ,  …  ,  m       i   0  1  normal-…  m     i=0,1,\ldots,m     or       E  S  P   (  x  )    =    x   s  m    +   x   s   (   m  -  1   )     +  ⋯  +   x  s   +  1.         E  S  P  x      superscript  x    s  m     superscript  x    s    m  1     normal-⋯   superscript  x  s   1.     ESP(x)=x^{sm}+x^{s(m-1)}+\cdots+x^{s}+1.     Properties  Over GF(2) the ESP has many interesting properties, including:   The Hamming weight of the ESP is m + 1.   A 1-ESP is known as an all one polynomial and has additional properties including the above.  References  "  Category:Field theory  Category:Polynomials
