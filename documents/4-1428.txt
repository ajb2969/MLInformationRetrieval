Equally spaced polynomial

An equally spaced polynomial (ESP) is a polynomial used in finite fields, specifically GF(2) (binary).
An s-ESP of degree sm can be written as:


 
  for 
 
 

or



Properties
Over GF(2) the ESP has many interesting properties, including:

The Hamming weight of the ESP is m + 1.

A 1-ESP is known as an all one polynomial and has additional properties including the above.
