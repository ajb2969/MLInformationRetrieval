   Sturm separation theorem      Sturm separation theorem   In mathematics , in the field of ordinary differential equations , Sturm separation theorem , named after Jacques Charles François Sturm , describes the location of roots of homogeneous  second order  linear differential equations . Basically the theorem states that given two linear independent solutions of such an equation the zeros of the two solutions are alternating.  Sturm separation theorem  Given a homogeneous second order linear differential equation and two continuous linear independent solutions u ( x ) and v ( x ) with x 0 and x 1 successive roots of u ( x ), then v ( x ) has exactly one root in the open interval ] x 0 , x 1 [. It is a special case of the Sturm-Picone comparison theorem .  Proof  Since   u   u   \displaystyle u   and   v   v   \displaystyle v   are linearly independent it follows that the Wronskian     W   [  u  ,  v  ]       W   u  v     \displaystyle W[u,v]   must satisfy     W   [  u  ,  v  ]    (  x  )    ≡   W   (  x  )    ≠  0          W   u  v   x     W  x        0     W[u,v](x)\equiv W(x)\neq 0   for all   x   x   \displaystyle x   where the differential equation is defined, say   I   I   \displaystyle I   . Without loss of generality, suppose that     W   (  x  )    <   0    ∀    x     ∈  I          W  x     0    for-all     x          I     W(x)<0\mbox{ }\forall\mbox{ }x\in I   . Then        u   (  x  )    v  ′    (  x  )    -    u  ′    (  x  )   v   (  x  )     ≠  0.          u  x   superscript  v  normal-′   x      superscript  u  normal-′   x  v  x    0.    u(x)v^{\prime}(x)-u^{\prime}(x)v(x)\neq 0.   So at    x  =   x  0       x   subscript  x  0     \displaystyle x=x_{0}          W   (   x  0   )    =   -    u  ′    (   x  0   )   v   (   x  0   )           W   subscript  x  0         superscript  u  normal-′    subscript  x  0   v   subscript  x  0       W(x_{0})=-u^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)v\left(x_{0}\right)   and either     u  ′    (   x  0   )        superscript  u  normal-′    subscript  x  0     u^{\prime}\left(x_{0}\right)   and    v   (   x  0   )       v   subscript  x  0     v\left(x_{0}\right)   are both positive or both negative. Without loss of generality, suppose that they are both positive. Now, at    x  =   x  1       x   subscript  x  1     \displaystyle x=x_{1}          W   (   x  1   )    =   -    u  ′    (   x  1   )   v   (   x  1   )           W   subscript  x  1         superscript  u  normal-′    subscript  x  1   v   subscript  x  1       W(x_{1})=-u^{\prime}\left(x_{1}\right)v\left(x_{1}\right)   and since    x  =   x  0       x   subscript  x  0     \displaystyle x=x_{0}   and    x  =   x  1       x   subscript  x  1     \displaystyle x=x_{1}   are successive zeros of    u   (  x  )       u  x    \displaystyle u(x)   it causes      u  ′    (   x  1   )    <  0         superscript  u  normal-′    subscript  x  1    0    u^{\prime}\left(x_{1}\right)<0   . Thus, to keep     W   (  x  )    <  0        W  x   0    \displaystyle W(x)<0   we must have     v   (   x  1   )    <  0        v   subscript  x  1    0    v\left(x_{1}\right)<0   . We see this by observing that if      u  ′    (  x  )    >   0    ∀    x     ∈   (   x  0   ,   x  1   ]            superscript  u  normal-′   x     0    for-all     x            subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1       \displaystyle u^{\prime}(x)>0\mbox{ }\forall\mbox{ }x\in\left(x_{0},x_{1}\right]   then    u   (  x  )       u  x    \displaystyle u(x)   would be increasing (away from the   x   x   \displaystyle x   -axis), which would never lead to a zero at    x  =   x  1       x   subscript  x  1     \displaystyle x=x_{1}   . So for a zero to occur at    x  =   x  1       x   subscript  x  1     \displaystyle x=x_{1}   at most      u  ′    (   x  1   )    =  0         superscript  u  normal-′    subscript  x  1    0    u^{\prime}\left(x_{1}\right)=0   (i.e.,      u  ′    (   x  1   )    ≤  0         superscript  u  normal-′    subscript  x  1    0    u^{\prime}\left(x_{1}\right)\leq 0   and it turns out, by our result from the Wronskian that      u  ′    (   x  1   )    ≤  0         superscript  u  normal-′    subscript  x  1    0    u^{\prime}\left(x_{1}\right)\leq 0   ). So somewhere in the interval    (   x  0   ,   x  1   )      subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1     \left(x_{0},x_{1}\right)   the sign of    v   (  x  )       v  x    \displaystyle v(x)   changed. By the Intermediate Value Theorem there exists     x  *   ∈   (   x  0   ,   x  1   )        superscript  x      subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1      x^{*}\in\left(x_{0},x_{1}\right)   such that     v   (   x  *   )    =  0        v   superscript  x     0    v\left(x^{*}\right)=0   .  On the other hand, there can be only one zero in    (   x  0   ,   x  1   )      subscript  x  0    subscript  x  1     \left(x_{0},x_{1}\right)   , because otherwise v would have two zeros and there would be no zeros of u in between, and it was just proved that this is impossible.
