   Planck temperature      Planck temperature   Planck temperature , denoted by T P , is the unit of temperature in the system of natural units known as Planck units .  It serves as the defining unit of the Planck temperature scale. In this scale the magnitude of the Planck temperature is equal to 1, while that of absolute zero is 0. Unlike Planck length and Planck time , which are defined as the smallest possible measurable units of length and time, Planck temperature is defined as the largest possible measurable unit of temperature. Other temperatures can be converted to Planck temperature units. For example, 0 °C = 273.15 K = 1.9279 × 10 −30 T P .  The Planck temperature in more common units of temperature is 2.55 × 10 32 degrees Fahrenheit (255 nonillion degrees Fahrenheit), and 1.417*10 32 degrees Celsius (141.7 nonillion degrees Celsius).  Definition  The Planck temperature is defined as:       T  P   =     m  P    c  2    k   =     ℏ   c  5     G   k  2             subscript  T  P        subscript  m  P    superscript  c  2    k              Planck-constant-over-2-pi   superscript  c  5      G   superscript  k  2         T_{\text{P}}=\frac{m_{\text{P}}c^{2}}{k}=\sqrt{\frac{\hbar c^{5}}{Gk^{2}}}   = 1.416833(85) × 10 32  K / - where:   m P is the Planck mass ,  c is speed of light in a vacuum,     ℏ   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   \hbar   is the reduced Planck constant defined as      ℏ   =   h   2  π     ,      Planck-constant-over-2-pi    h    2  π      \hbar\ =\frac{h}{2\pi},     k is the Boltzmann constant ,  G is the gravitational constant .   The two digits between the parentheses are used to denote the standard error of the last two digits of the estimated value. 1  Significance  As for most of Planck units, a Planck temperature of 1 (unity) is a fundamental limit of quantum theory , in combination with gravitation , as presently understood. In other words, the wavelength of an object can be calculated by its temperature. If an object were to reach the temperature of 1.41 x 10 32 Kelvin ( T P ), the radiation it would emit would have a wavelength of 1.616 x 10 −26 nanometers ( Planck length ), at which point quantum gravitational effects become relevant. At temperatures greater than or equal to T P , current physical theory breaks down because we lack a theory of quantum gravity . 2  See also   Absolute hot  Hagedorn temperature  Orders of magnitude (temperature)  Planck constant  Planck units   Notes and references  External links   NIST reference: Planck temperature  What is the opposite of absolute zero?
