   Gauss–Markov process      Gauss–Markov process   Gauss–Markov stochastic processes (named after Carl Friedrich Gauss and Andrey Markov ) are stochastic processes that satisfy the requirements for both Gaussian processes and Markov processes . 1 2 The stationary Gauss–Markov process is a very special case because it is unique, except for some trivial exceptions.  Every Gauss–Markov process X ( t ) possesses the three following properties:   If h ( t ) is a non-zero scalar function of t , then Z ( t ) = h ( t ) X ( t ) is also a Gauss–Markov process  If f ( t ) is a non-decreasing scalar function of t , then Z ( t ) = X ( f ( t )) is also a Gauss–Markov process  There exists a non-zero scalar function h ( t ) and a non-decreasing scalar function f ( t ) such that X ( t ) = h ( t ) W ( f ( t )), where W ( t ) is the standard Wiener process .   Property (3) means that every Gauss–Markov process can be synthesized from the standard Wiener process (SWP).  Properties of the Stationary Gauss-Markov Processes  A stationary Gauss–Markov process with variance      𝐄   (    X  2    (  t  )    )    =   σ  2         E     superscript  X  2   t     superscript  σ  2     \textbf{E}(X^{2}(t))=\sigma^{2}   and time constant     β   -  1      superscript  β    1     \beta^{-1}   has the following properties.  Exponential autocorrelation :         𝐑  x    (  τ  )    =    σ  2    e   -   β   |  τ  |        .         subscript  R  x   τ      superscript  σ  2    superscript  e      β    τ         \textbf{R}_{x}(\tau)=\sigma^{2}e^{-\beta|\tau|}.\,     A power spectral density (PSD) function that has the same shape as the Cauchy distribution :         𝐒  x    (   j  ω   )    =    2   σ  2   β     ω  2   +   β  2      .         subscript  S  x     j  ω        2   superscript  σ  2   β      superscript  ω  2    superscript  β  2       \textbf{S}_{x}(j\omega)=\frac{2\sigma^{2}\beta}{\omega^{2}+\beta^{2}}.\,     (Note that the Cauchy distribution and this spectrum differ by scale factors.)  The above yields the following spectral factorization:         𝐒  x    (  s  )    =    2   σ  2   β     -   s  2    +   β  2     =        2  β     σ    (   s  +  β   )    ⋅       2  β     σ    (    -  s   +  β   )      .           subscript  S  x   s       2   superscript  σ  2   β        superscript  s  2     superscript  β  2           normal-⋅          2  β    σ     s  β            2  β    σ       s   β        \textbf{S}_{x}(s)=\frac{2\sigma^{2}\beta}{-s^{2}+\beta^{2}}=\frac{\sqrt{2\beta%
 }\,\sigma}{(s+\beta)}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{2\beta}\,\sigma}{(-s+\beta)}.     which is important in Wiener filtering and other areas.  There are also some trivial exceptions to all of the above.  See also  Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process  References  "  Category:Markov processes     ↩  ↩
