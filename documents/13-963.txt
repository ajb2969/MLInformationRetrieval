   Brinkmann graph      Brinkmann graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the Brinkmann graph is a 4- regular graph with 21 vertices and 42 edges discovered by Gunnar Brinkmann in 1992. 1 2 It was first published by Brinkmann and Meringer in 1997. 3  It has chromatic number 4, chromatic index 5, radius 3, diameter 3 and girth 5. It is also a 3- vertex-connected graph and a 3- edge-connected graph .  By Brooks’ theorem , every k -regular graph (except for odd cycles and cliques) has chromatic number at most k . It was also known since 1959 that, for every k and l there exist k -chromatic graphs with girth l . 4 In connection with these two results and several examples including the Chvátal graph, Branko Grünbaum conjectured in 1970 that for every k and l there exist k -chromatic k -regular graphs with girth l . 5 The Chvátal graph solves the case k = l = 4 of this conjecture and the Brinkmann graph solves the case k =  4, l = 5. Grünbaum's conjecture was disproved for sufficiently large k by Johannsen, who showed that the chromatic number of a triangle-free graph is O(Δ/log Δ) where Δ is the maximum vertex degree and the O introduces big O notation . 6 However, despite this disproof, it remains of interest to find examples and only very few are known.  The chromatic polynomial of the Brinkmann graph is x 21 - 42 x 20 + 861 x 19 - 11480 x 18 + 111881 x 17 - 848708 x 16 + 5207711 x 15 - 26500254 x 14 + 113675219 x 13 - 415278052 x 12 + 1299042255 x 11 - 3483798283 x 10 + 7987607279 x 9 - 15547364853 x 8 + 25384350310 x 7 - 34133692383 x 6 + 36783818141 x 5 - 30480167403 x 4 + 18168142566 x 3 - 6896700738 x 2 + 1242405972 x .  Algebraic properties  The Brinkmann graph is not a vertex-transitive graph and its full automorphism group is isomorphic to the dihedral group of order 14, the group of symmetries of an heptagon , including both rotations and reflections.  The characteristic polynomial of the Brinkmann graph is     (   x  -  4   )    (   x  -  2   )    (   x  +  2   )     (     x  3   -   x  2   -   2  x    +  1   )   2         x  4     x  2     x  2    superscript       superscript  x  3    superscript  x  2     2  x    1   2     (x-4)(x-2)(x+2)(x^{3}-x^{2}-2x+1)^{2}        (       x  6   +   3   x  5     -   8   x  4    -   21   x  3     +   27   x  2    +   38  x    -  41   )   2     superscript           superscript  x  6     3   superscript  x  5       8   superscript  x  4      21   superscript  x  3       27   superscript  x  2      38  x    41   2    (x^{6}+3x^{5}-8x^{4}-21x^{3}+27x^{2}+38x-41)^{2}   .
