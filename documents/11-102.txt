   Lysine—tRNA(Pyl) ligase      Lysine—tRNA(Pyl) ligase   In enzymology , a lysine-tRNAPyl ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-lysine + tRNAPyl   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-lysyl-tRNAPyl   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-lysine , and tRNA(Pyl) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and L-lysyl-tRNA(Pyl) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-lysine:tRNAPyl ligase (AMP-forming) .  References      "  Category:EC 6.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
