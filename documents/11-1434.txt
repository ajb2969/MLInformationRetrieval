   Alkylglycerol kinase      Alkylglycerol kinase   In enzymology , an alkylglycerol kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 1-O-alkyl-sn- glycerol    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycerol , whereas its two products are ADP and 1-O-alkyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1-O-alkyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include 1-alkylglycerol kinase (phosphorylating) , ATP-alkylglycerol phosphotransferase , alkylglycerol phosphotransferase , and ATP: 1-alkyl-sn-glycerol phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
