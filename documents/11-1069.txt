   Asparagine—oxo-acid transaminase      Asparagine—oxo-acid transaminase   In enzymology , an asparagine-oxo-acid transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-asparagine + a 2-oxo acid   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxosuccinamate + an amino acid   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-asparagine and 2-oxo acid , whereas its two products are 2-oxosuccinamate and amino acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-asparagine:2-oxo-acid aminotransferase . This enzyme is also called asparagine-keto acid aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in alanine and aspartate metabolism and tetracycline biosynthesis . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
