   Toda field theory      Toda field theory   In the study of field theory and partial differential equations , a Toda field theory (named after Morikazu Toda ) is derived from the following Lagrangian :       ℒ  =     1  2    [    (    ∂  ϕ    ∂  t    ,    ∂  ϕ    ∂  t    )   -   (    ∂  ϕ    ∂  x    ,    ∂  ϕ    ∂  x    )    ]    -     m  2    β  2      ∑   i  =  1   r     n  i    e    β   α  i    ⋅  ϕ         .      ℒ        1  2    delimited-[]         ϕ     t        ϕ     t          ϕ     x        ϕ     x             superscript  m  2    superscript  β  2      superscript   subscript     i  1    r      subscript  n  i    superscript  e   normal-⋅    β   subscript  α  i    ϕ          \mathcal{L}=\frac{1}{2}\left[\left({\partial\phi\over\partial t},{\partial\phi%
 \over\partial t}\right)-\left({\partial\phi\over\partial x},{\partial\phi\over%
 \partial x}\right)\right]-{m^{2}\over\beta^{2}}\sum_{i=1}^{r}n_{i}e^{\beta%

Here x and t are spacetime coordinates, (,) is the Killing form of a real r-dimensional Cartan algebra    𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   of a Kac–Moody algebra over   𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   , α i is the i th  simple root in some root basis, n i is the Coxeter number , m is the mass (or bare mass in the quantum field theory version) and β is the coupling constant .  Then a Toda field theory is the study of a function φ mapping 2-dimensional Minkowski space satisfying the corresponding Euler–Lagrange equations .  If the Kac–Moody algebra is finite, it's called a Toda field theory. If it is affine, it is called an affine Toda field theory (after the component of φ which decouples is removed) and if it is hyperbolic , it is called a hyperbolic Toda field theory.  Toda field theories are integrable models and their solutions describe solitons .  Examples  Liouville field theory is associated to the A 1  Cartan matrix .  The sinh-Gordon model is the affine Toda field theory with the generalized Cartan matrix      (     2     -  2        -  2     2     )      2    2       2   2     \begin{pmatrix}2&-2\\
 -2&2\end{pmatrix}     and a positive value for β after we project out a component of φ which decouples.  The sine-Gordon model is the model with the same Cartan matrix but an imaginary β.  References     "  Category:Lattice models  Category:Lie algebras  Category:Exactly solvable models
