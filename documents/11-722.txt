Glutathionylspermidine amidase

In enzymology, a glutathionylspermidine amidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

glutathionylspermidine + H2O 
 
 
 
  glutathione + spermidine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glutathionylspermidine and H2O, whereas its two products are glutathione and spermidine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is gamma-L-glutamyl-L-cysteinyl-glycine:spermidine amidase. This enzyme is also called glutathionylspermidine amidohydrolase (spermidine-forming). This enzyme participates in glutathione metabolism.
