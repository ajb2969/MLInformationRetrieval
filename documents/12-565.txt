   Modal matrix      Modal matrix   In linear algebra , the modal matrix is used in the diagonalization process involving eigenvalues and eigenvectors . 1  Specifically the modal matrix   M   M   M   for the matrix   A   A   A   is the n × n matrix formed with the eigenvectors of   A   A   A   as columns in   M   M   M   . It is utilized in the similarity transformation       D  =    M   -  1    A  M    ,      D     superscript  M    1    A  M     D=M^{-1}AM,     where   D   D   D   is an n × n  diagonal matrix with the eigenvalues of   A   A   A   on the main diagonal of   D   D   D   and zeros elsewhere. The matrix   D   D   D   is called the spectral matrix for   A   A   A   . The eigenvalues must appear left to right, top to bottom in the same order as their corresponding eigenvectors are arranged left to right in   M   M   M   . 2  Example  The matrix      A  =   (     3    2    0      2    0    0      1    0    2     )       A    3  2  0    2  0  0    1  0  2      A=\begin{pmatrix}3&2&0\\
 2&0&0\\
 1&0&2\end{pmatrix}     has eigenvalues and corresponding eigenvectors         λ  1   =   -  1    ,    𝕓  1   =   (   -  3   ,  6  ,  1  )     ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  λ  1     1       subscript  𝕓  1      3   6  1      \lambda_{1}=-1,\quad\,\mathbb{b}_{1}=\left(-3,6,1\right),            λ  2   =  2   ,    𝕓  2   =   (  0  ,  0  ,  1  )     ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  λ  2   2      subscript  𝕓  2    0  0  1      \lambda_{2}=2,\qquad\mathbb{b}_{2}=\left(0,0,1\right),            λ  3   =  4   ,    𝕓  3   =   (  2  ,  1  ,  1  )     .     formulae-sequence     subscript  λ  3   4      subscript  𝕓  3    2  1  1      \lambda_{3}=4,\qquad\mathbb{b}_{3}=\left(2,1,1\right).     A diagonal matrix   D   D   D   , similar to   A   A   A   is       D  =   (      -  1     0    0      0    2    0      0    0    4     )    .      D      1   0  0    0  2  0    0  0  4      D=\begin{pmatrix}-1&0&0\\
 0&2&0\\
 0&0&4\end{pmatrix}.     One possible choice for an invertible matrix    M   M   M   such that     D  =    M   -  1    A  M    ,      D     superscript  M    1    A  M     D=M^{-1}AM,   is       M  =   (      -  3     0    2      6    0    1      1    1    1     )    .      M      3   0  2    6  0  1    1  1  1      M=\begin{pmatrix}-3&0&2\\
 6&0&1\\
 1&1&1\end{pmatrix}.    3  Note that since eigenvectors themselves are not unique, and since the columns of both   M   M   M   and   D   D   D   may be interchanged, it follows that both   M   M   M   and   D   D   D   are not unique. 4  Generalized modal matrix  Let   A   A   A   be an n × n matrix. A generalized modal matrix    M   M   M   for   A   A   A   is an n × n matrix whose columns, considered as vectors, form a canonical basis for   A   A   A   and appear in   M   M   M   according to the following rules:   All Jordan chains consisting of one vector (that is, one vector in length) appear in the first columns of   M   M   M   .  All vectors of one chain appear together in adjacent columns of   M   M   M   .  Each chain appears in   M   M   M   in order of increasing rank (that is, the generalized eigenvector of rank 1 appears before the generalized eigenvector of rank 2 of the same chain, which appears before the generalized eigenvector of rank 3 of the same chain, etc.). 5   One can show that         where   J   J   J   is a matrix in Jordan normal form . By premultiplying by    M   -  1      superscript  M    1     M^{-1}   , we obtain         Note that when computing these matrices, equation () is the easiest of the two equations to verify, since it does not require inverting a matrix. 6  Example  This example illustrates a generalized modal matrix with four Jordan chains. Unfortunately, it is a little difficult to construct an interesting example of low order. 7 The matrix      A  =   (      -  1     0     -  1     1    1    3    0      0    1    0    0    0    0    0      2    1    2     -  1      -  1      -  6     0       -  2     0     -  1     2    1    3    0      0    0    0    0    1    0    0      0    0    0    0    0    1    0       -  1      -  1     0    1    2    4    1     )       A      1   0    1   1  1  3  0    0  1  0  0  0  0  0    2  1  2    1     1     6   0      2   0    1   2  1  3  0    0  0  0  0  1  0  0    0  0  0  0  0  1  0      1     1   0  1  2  4  1      A=\begin{pmatrix}-1&0&-1&1&1&3&0\\

A canonical basis for   A   A   A   will consist of one linearly independent generalized eigenvector of rank 3 (generalized eigenvector rank; see generalized eigenvector ), two of rank 2 and four of rank 1; or equivalently, one chain of three vectors    {   𝕩  3   ,   𝕩  2   ,   𝕩  1   }      subscript  𝕩  3    subscript  𝕩  2    subscript  𝕩  1     \left\{\mathbb{x}_{3},\mathbb{x}_{2},\mathbb{x}_{1}\right\}   , one chain of two vectors    {   𝕪  2   ,   𝕪  1   }      subscript  𝕪  2    subscript  𝕪  1     \left\{\mathbb{y}_{2},\mathbb{y}_{1}\right\}   , and two chains of one vector    {   𝕫  1   }      subscript  𝕫  1     \left\{\mathbb{z}_{1}\right\}   ,    {   𝕨  1   }      subscript  𝕨  1     \left\{\mathbb{w}_{1}\right\}   .  An "almost diagonal" matrix   J   J   J   in Jordan normal form , similar to   A   A   A   is obtained as follows:       M  =   (      𝕫  1      𝕨  1      𝕩  1      𝕩  2      𝕩  3      𝕪  1      𝕪  2      )   =   (     0    1     -  1     0    0     -  2     1      0    3    0    0    1    0    0       -  1     1    1    1    0    2    0       -  2     0     -  1     0    0     -  2     0      1    0    0    0    0    0    0      0    1    0    0    0    0    0      0    0    0     -  1     0     -  1     0     )    ,        M     subscript  𝕫  1    subscript  𝕨  1    subscript  𝕩  1    subscript  𝕩  2    subscript  𝕩  3    subscript  𝕪  1    subscript  𝕪  2            0  1    1   0  0    2   1    0  3  0  0  1  0  0      1   1  1  1  0  2  0      2   0    1   0  0    2   0    1  0  0  0  0  0  0    0  1  0  0  0  0  0    0  0  0    1   0    1   0       M=\begin{pmatrix}\mathbb{z}_{1}&\mathbb{w}_{1}&\mathbb{x}_{1}&\mathbb{x}_{2}&%
