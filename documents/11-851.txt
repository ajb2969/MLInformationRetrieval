Aminoglycoside N3'-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, an aminoglycoside N3'-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + a 2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic 
 
 
 
  CoA + N3'-acetyl-2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and 2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic, whereas its two products are CoA and N3'-acetyl-2-deoxystreptamine antibiotic.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:2-deoxystreptamine-antibiotic N3'-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include 3'-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase, and 3-N-aminoglycoside acetyltransferase.
