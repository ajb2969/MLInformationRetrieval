   Credit valuation adjustment      Credit valuation adjustment   Credit valuation adjustment (CVA) is the difference between the risk-free portfolio value and the true portfolio value that takes into account the possibility of a counterparty ’s default. In other words, CVA is the market value of counterparty credit risk .  Unilateral CVA is given by the risk-neutral expectation of the discounted loss. The risk-neutral expectation can be written as      CVA  =   E  Q    [   L  *   ]   =   (  1  -  R  )    ∫  0  T    E  Q    [    B  0    B  t    E   (  t  )   |  τ  =  t  ]   d  PD   (  0  ,  t  )      fragments  CVA    superscript  E  Q    fragments  normal-[   superscript  L    normal-]     fragments  normal-(  1   R  normal-)    superscript   subscript   0   T    superscript  E  Q    fragments  normal-[     subscript  B  0    subscript  B  t    E   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)   normal-|  τ   t  normal-]   d  PD   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-,  t  normal-)     \mathrm{CVA}=E^{Q}[L^{*}]=(1-R)\int_{0}^{T}E^{Q}\left[\frac{B_{0}}{B_{t}}E(t)|%

These probabilities can be obtained from the term structure of credit default swap (CDS) spreads.  More generally CVA can refer to a few different concepts:   The mathematical concept as defined above;  A part of the regulatory Capital and RWA (Risk weighted asset) calculation introduced under Basel 3;  The CVA desk of an investment bank, whose purpose is to:  hedge for possible losses due to counterparty default;  hedge to reduce the amount of capital required under the CVA calculation of Basel 3;   The "CVA charge". The hedging of the CVA desk has a cost associated to it, i.e. the bank has to buy the hedging instrument. This cost is then allocated to each business line of an investment bank (usually as a contra revenue). This allocated cost is called the "CVA Charge".   Exposure, independent of counterparty default  Assuming independence between exposure and counterparty’s credit quality greatly simplifies the analysis. Under this assumption this simplifies to      CVA  =    (   1  -  R   )     ∫  0  T     EE  *    (  t  )   d  PD   (  0  ,  t  )          CVA      1  R     superscript   subscript   0   T      superscript  EE    t  d  PD   0  t        \mathrm{CVA}=(1-R)\int_{0}^{T}\mathrm{EE}^{*}(t)~{}d\mathrm{PD}(0,t)     where    EE  *     superscript  EE     \mathrm{EE}^{*}   is the risk-neutral discounted expected exposure (EE)  The function of the CVA desk and implications for technology solution  In the view of leading investment banks , CVA is essentially an activity carried out by both finance and a trading desk in the Front Office. Tier 1 banks either already generate counterparty EPE and ENE (expected positive/negative exposure) under the ownership of the CVA desk (although this often has another name) or plan to do so. Whilst a CVA platform is based on an exposure measurement platform, the requirements of an active CVA desk differ from those of a Risk Control group and it is not uncommon to see institutions use different systems for risk exposure management on one hand and CVA pricing and hedging on the other.
