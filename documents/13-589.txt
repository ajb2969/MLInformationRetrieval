   Matérn covariance function      Matérn covariance function   In statistics , the Matérn covariance (named after the Swedish forestry statistician Bertil Matérn 1 ) is a covariance function used in spatial statistics , geostatistics , machine learning , image analysis, and other applications of multivariate statistical analysis on metric spaces . It is commonly used to define the statistical covariance between measurements made at two points that are d units distant from each other. Since the covariance only depends on distances between points, it is stationary . If the distance is Euclidean distance , the Matérn covariance is also isotropic .  The Matérn covariance between two points separated by d distance units is given by        C   (  d  )    =    σ  2    1   Γ   (  ν  )    2   ν  -  1        (     2  ν     d  ρ    )   ν    K  ν    (     2  ν     d  ρ    )     ,        C  d      superscript  σ  2     1    normal-Γ  ν   superscript  2    ν  1       superscript        2  ν      d  ρ    ν    subscript  K  ν         2  ν      d  ρ       C(d)=\sigma^{2}\frac{1}{\Gamma(\nu)2^{\nu-1}}\Bigg(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}%
 \Bigg)^{\nu}K_{\nu}\Bigg(\sqrt{2\nu}\frac{d}{\rho}\Bigg),     where Γ is the gamma function , K ν is the modified Bessel function of the second kind, and ρ and ν are non-negative parameters of the covariance.  A Gaussian process with Matérn covariance has sample paths that are    ⌊   ν  -  1   ⌋        ν  1     \lfloor\nu-1\rfloor   times differentiable. 2 As    ν  →  ∞     normal-→  ν     \nu\rightarrow\infty   , the Matérn covariance converges to the squared exponential covariance function        C   (  d  )    =    σ  2    exp   (   -     d  2   /  2    ρ  2     )      .        C  d      superscript  σ  2            superscript  d  2   2    superscript  ρ  2         C(d)=\sigma^{2}\exp(-d^{2}/2\rho^{2}).     When    ν  =   1  /  2       ν    1  2     \nu=1/2   , the Matérn covariance is identical to the exponential covariance function. In fact, 3         C   (  d  )    =    σ  2    exp   (   -   d  ρ    )       ν  =    1  2      ,     formulae-sequence      C  d      superscript  σ  2         d  ρ         ν    1  2      C(d)=\sigma^{2}\exp\Bigg(-\frac{d}{\rho}\Bigg)\quad\quad\nu=\tfrac{1}{2},            C   (  d  )    =    σ  2    (   1  +     3   d   ρ    )    exp   (   -     3   d   ρ    )       ν  =    3  2      ,     formulae-sequence      C  d      superscript  σ  2     1        3   d   ρ              3   d   ρ         ν    3  2      C(d)=\sigma^{2}\Bigg(1+\frac{\sqrt{3}d}{\rho}\Bigg)\exp\Bigg(-\frac{\sqrt{3}d}%
