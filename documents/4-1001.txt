The conchoid(s) of de Sluze is a family of plane curves studied in 1662 by René François Walter, baron de Sluze.1
The curves are defined by the polar equation


 
 . In cartesian coordinates, the curves satisfy the implicit equation


 
  except that for a=0 the implicit form has an acnode (0,0) not present in polar form.
They are rational, circular, cubic plane curves.
These expressions have an asymptote x=1 (for a≠0). The point most distant from the asymptote is (1+a,0). (0,0) is a crunode for aa \ge -1,


 
  while for 
 
 
 
 , the area is


 
  If 
 
 
 
 , the curve will have a loop. The area of the loop is



Four of the family have names of their own:

a=0, line (asymptote to the rest of the family)
 
a=−1, cissoid of Diocles

a=−2, right strophoid

a=−4, trisectrix of Maclaurin
