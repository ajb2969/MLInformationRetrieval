   Conchoid of de Sluze      Conchoid of de Sluze   (Figure)  The Conchoid of de Sluze for several values of a   The conchoid(s) of de Sluze is a family of plane curves studied in 1662 by René François Walter , baron de Sluze. 1  The curves are defined by the polar equation      r  =    sec  θ   +   a   cos   θ          r      θ     a    θ       r=\sec\theta+a\cos\theta\,   . In cartesian coordinates , the curves satisfy the implicit equation        (   x  -  1   )    (    x  2   +   y  2    )    =   a    x  2             x  1      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       a   superscript  x  2      (x-1)(x^{2}+y^{2})=ax^{2}\,   except that for a =0 the implicit form has an acnode (0,0) not present in polar form.  They are rational , circular , cubic plane curves .  These expressions have an asymptote  x =1 (for a ≠0). The point most distant from the asymptote is (1+ a ,0). (0,0) is a crunode for a a \ge -1,       |  a  |    (   1  +   a  /  4    )    π         a     1    a  4    π    |a|(1+a/4)\pi\,   while for    a  <   -  1       a    1     a<-1   , the area is         (   1  -   a  2    )     -   (   a  +  1   )      -   a   (   2  +   a  2    )    arcsin   1    -  a        .          1    a  2          a  1        a    2    a  2        1      a         \left(1-\frac{a}{2}\right)\sqrt{-(a+1)}-a\left(2+\frac{a}{2}\right)\arcsin%

The area of the loop is         (   2  +   a  2    )   a   arccos   1    -  a       +    (   1  -   a  2    )     -   (   a  +  1   )       .          2    a  2    a      1      a           1    a  2          a  1        \left(2+\frac{a}{2}\right)a\arccos\frac{1}{\sqrt{-a}}+\left(1-\frac{a}{2}%
