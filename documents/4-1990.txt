   Bipolar coordinates      Bipolar coordinates   (Figure)  |thumb|right|350px|Bipolar coordinate system   Bipolar coordinates are a two-dimensional orthogonal  coordinate system . There are two commonly defined types of bipolar coordinates. 1 The first is based on the Apollonian circles . The curves of constant σ and of τ are circles that intersect at right angles. The coordinates have two foci  F 1 and F 2 , which are generally taken to be fixed at (− a , 0) and ( a , 0), respectively, on the x -axis of a Cartesian coordinate system . The second system is two-center bipolar coordinates . There is also a third coordinate system that is based on two poles ( biangular coordinates ).  The term "bipolar" is sometimes used to describe other curves having two singular points (foci), such as ellipses , hyperbolas , and Cassini ovals . However, the term bipolar coordinates is reserved for the coordinates described here, and never used to describe coordinates associated with those other curves, such as elliptic coordinates .  (Figure)  Geometric interpretation of the bipolar coordinates. The angle σ is formed by the two foci and the point P , whereas τ is the logarithm of the ratio of distances to the foci. The corresponding circles of constant σ and τ are shown in red and blue, respectively, and meet at right angles (magenta box); they are orthogonal.   Definition  The most common definition of bipolar coordinates ( σ , τ ) is      x  =    a     sinh  τ     cosh  τ   -   cos  σ          x    a      τ       τ     σ        x=a\ \frac{\sinh\tau}{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}         y  =    a     sin  σ     cosh  τ   -   cos  σ          y    a      σ       τ     σ        y=a\ \frac{\sin\sigma}{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}     where the σ -coordinate of a point P equals the angle F 1  P  F 2 and the τ -coordinate equals the natural logarithm of the ratio of the distances d 1 and d 2 to the foci      τ  =   ln    d  1    d  2         τ       subscript  d  1    subscript  d  2       \tau=\ln\frac{d_{1}}{d_{2}}     (Recall that F 1 and F 2 are located at (− a , 0) and ( a , 0), respectively.) Equivalently       x  +   i  y    =   a  i   cot   (    σ  +   i  τ    2   )           x    i  y      a  i        σ    i  τ    2       x+iy=ai\cot\left(\frac{\sigma+i\tau}{2}\right)    2 3  Curves of constant σ and τ  (Figure)  Bipolar sigma isosurfaces.png   (Figure)  Bipolar tau isosurfaces.png   The curves of constant σ correspond to non-concentric circles        x  2   +    (   y  -   a   cot  σ     )   2    =    a  2     sin  2   σ           superscript  x  2    superscript    y    a    σ     2       superscript  a  2     superscript   2   σ      x^{2}+\left(y-a\cot\sigma\right)^{2}=\frac{a^{2}}{\sin^{2}\sigma}     that intersect at the two foci. The centers of the constant- σ circles lie on the y -axis. Circles of positive σ are centered above the x -axis, whereas those of negative σ lie below the axis. As the magnitude | σ | increases, the radius of the circles decreases and the center approaches the origin (0, 0), which is reached when | σ | = π /2, its maximum value.  The curves of constant   τ   τ   \tau   are non-intersecting circles of different radii        y  2   +    (   x  -   a   coth  τ     )   2    =    a  2     sinh  2   τ           superscript  y  2    superscript    x    a   hyperbolic-cotangent  τ     2       superscript  a  2     superscript   2   τ      y^{2}+\left(x-a\coth\tau\right)^{2}=\frac{a^{2}}{\sinh^{2}\tau}     that surround the foci but again are not concentric. The centers of the constant- τ circles lie on the x -axis. The circles of positive τ lie in the right-hand side of the plane ( x > 0), whereas the circles of negative τ lie in the left-hand side of the plane ( x   \tau = \frac{1}{2} \ln \frac{(x + a)^2 + y^2}{(x - a)^2 + y^2}  and        π  -  σ   =   2   arctan    2  a  y      a  2   -   x  2   -   y  2    +      (    a  2   -   x  2   -   y  2    )   2   +   4   a  2    y  2           .        π  σ     2        2  a  y        superscript  a  2    superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2         superscript     superscript  a  2    superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    2     4   superscript  a  2    superscript  y  2            \pi-\sigma=2\arctan\frac{2ay}{a^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2}+\sqrt{(a^{2}-x^{2}-y^{2})^{2}+%

We notice also those two remarkable identities:       tanh  τ   =    2  a  x     x  2   +   y  2   +   a  2           τ       2  a  x      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  a  2       \tanh\tau=\frac{2ax}{x^{2}+y^{2}+a^{2}}   and        tan  σ   =    2  a  y      x  2   +   y  2    -   a  2      .        σ       2  a  y        superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  a  2       \tan\sigma=\frac{2ay}{x^{2}+y^{2}-a^{2}}.     Scale factors  The scale factors for the bipolar coordinates ( σ , τ ) are equal       h  σ   =   h  τ   =   a    cosh  τ   -   cos  σ            subscript  h  σ    subscript  h  τ          a      τ     σ        h_{\sigma}=h_{\tau}=\frac{a}{\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma}     Thus, the infinitesimal area element equals       d  A   =      a  2     (    cosh  τ   -   cos  σ    )   2     d   σ   d  τ         d  A        superscript  a  2    superscript      τ     σ    2    d  σ  d  τ     dA=\frac{a^{2}}{\left(\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma\right)^{2}}\,d\sigma\,d\tau     and the Laplacian is given by        ∇  2   Φ   =    1   a  2      (    cosh  τ   -   cos  σ    )   2    (      ∂  2   Φ    ∂   σ  2     +     ∂  2   Φ    ∂   τ  2      )          superscript  normal-∇  2   normal-Φ       1   superscript  a  2     superscript      τ     σ    2         superscript   2   normal-Φ      superscript  σ  2         superscript   2   normal-Φ      superscript  τ  2         \nabla^{2}\Phi=\frac{1}{a^{2}}\left(\cosh\tau-\cos\sigma\right)^{2}\left(\frac%

 }}\right)     Other differential operators such as    ∇  ⋅  𝐅     normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐅    \nabla\cdot\mathbf{F}   and    ∇  ×  𝐅      normal-∇  𝐅    \nabla\times\mathbf{F}   can be expressed in the coordinates ( σ , τ ) by substituting the scale factors into the general formulae found in orthogonal coordinates .  Applications  The classic applications of bipolar coordinates are in solving partial differential equations , e.g., Laplace's equation or the Helmholtz equation , for which bipolar coordinates allow a separation of variables . A typical example would be the electric field surrounding two parallel cylindrical conductors.  Extension to 3-dimensions  Bipolar coordinates form the basis for several sets of three-dimensional orthogonal coordinates . The bipolar cylindrical coordinates are produced by projecting in the z -direction. The bispherical coordinates are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the   x   x   x   -axis, i.e., the axis connecting the foci, whereas the toroidal coordinates are produced by rotating the bipolar coordinates about the y -axis, i.e., the axis separating the foci.
