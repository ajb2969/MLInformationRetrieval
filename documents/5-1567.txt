   Dobinski's formula      Dobinski's formula   In combinatorial mathematics, Dobiński’s formula 1 states that the number of partitions of a set of n members is        1  e     ∑   k  =  0   ∞     k  n    k  !      .        1  e     superscript   subscript     k  0         superscript  k  n     k       {1\over e}\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}{k^{n}\over k!}.     The formula is named after G. Dobiński, who published it in 1877. The number on both sides of the formula has come to be called the n th Bell number  B n , after the later work of Eric Temple Bell .  The above formula can be seen as a particular case, for    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   , of the more general relation:        1  e     ∑   k  =  x   ∞     k  n     (   k  -  x   )   !      =    ∑   k  =  0   n     (     n      k     )    B  k    x   n  -  k              1  e     superscript   subscript     k  x         superscript  k  n       k  x         superscript   subscript     k  0    n      binomial  n  k    subscript  B  k    superscript  x    n  k        {1\over e}\sum_{k=x}^{\infty}{k^{n}\over(k-x)!}=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose k}B_{k%

Today, Dobinski's formula is sometimes stated by saying the number of partitions of a set of size n equals the n th moment of that distribution.  A proof  The proof given here is an adaptation to probabilistic language, of the proof given by Rota . 2  Combinatorialists use the Pochhammer symbol ( x ) n to denote the falling factorial        (  x  )   n   =   x   (   x  -  1   )    (   x  -  2   )   ⋯   (    x  -  n   +  1   )         subscript  x  n     x    x  1     x  2   normal-⋯      x  n   1      (x)_{n}=x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-n+1)\,     (whereas, in the theory of special functions , the same notation denotes the rising factorial). If x and n are nonnegative integers, 0 ≤ n ≤ x , then ( x ) n is the number of one-to-one functions that map a size- n set into a size- x set.  Let ƒ be any function from a size- n set A into a size- x set B . For any u ∈ B , let ƒ −1 ( u ) = { v ∈ A : ƒ ( v ) = u }. Then { ƒ −1 ( u ) : u ∈ B } is a partition of A , coming from the equivalence relation of "being in the same fiber ". This equivalence relation is called the " kernel " of the function ƒ . Any function from A into B factors into   one function that maps a member of A to that part of the kernel to which it belongs, and  another function, which is necessarily one-to-one, that maps the kernel into B .   The first of these two factors is completely determined by the partition π that is the kernel. The number of one-to-one functions from π into B is ( x ) |π| , where |π| is the number of parts in the partition π. Thus the total number of functions from a size- n set A into a size- x set B is        ∑  π     (  x  )    |  π  |     ,      subscript   π    subscript  x    π      \sum_{\pi}(x)_{|\pi|},\,     the index π running through the set of all partitions of A . On the other hand, the number of functions from A into B is clearly x n . Therefore we have        x  n   =    ∑  π     (  x  )    |  π  |      .       superscript  x  n     subscript   π    subscript  x    π       x^{n}=\sum_{\pi}(x)_{|\pi|}.\,     If X is a Poisson-distributed  random variable with expected value 1, then we get that the n th moment of this probability distribution is        E   (   X  n   )    =    ∑  π    E   (    (  X  )    |  π  |    )      .        E   superscript  X  n      subscript   π     E   subscript  X    π        E(X^{n})=\sum_{\pi}E((X)_{|\pi|}).\,     But all of the factorial moments E(( X ) k ) of this probability distribution are equal to 1. Therefore        E   (   X  n   )    =    ∑  π   1    ,        E   superscript  X  n      subscript   π   1     E(X^{n})=\sum_{\pi}1,\,     and this is just the number of partitions of the set A .
