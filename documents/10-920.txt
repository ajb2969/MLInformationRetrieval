   Delta24(241)-sterol reductase      Delta24(241)-sterol reductase   In enzymology , a Delta24(241)-sterol reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ergosterol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ergosta-5,7,22,24(241)-tetraen-3beta-ol + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ergosterol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are ergosta-5,7,22,24(241)-tetraen-3beta-ol , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ergosterol:NADP+ Delta24(241)-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include sterol Delta24(28)-methylene reductase , and sterol Delta24(28)-reductase . This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids .
