   Fractional quantum mechanics      Fractional quantum mechanics   In physics , fractional quantum mechanics is a generalization of standard quantum mechanics , which naturally comes out when the Brownian-like quantum paths substitute with the Lévy-like ones in the Feynman path integral . It has been discovered by Nick Laskin who coined the term fractional quantum mechanics . 1  Fundamentals  Standard quantum mechanics can be approached in three different ways: the matrix mechanics , the Schrödinger equation and the Feynman path integral .  The Feynman path integral 2 is the path integral over Brownian-like quantum-mechanical paths. Fractional quantum mechanics has been discovered by Nick Laskin (1999) as a result of expanding the Feynman path integral , from the Brownian-like to the Lévy-like quantum mechanical paths. A path integral over the Lévy-like quantum-mechanical paths results in a generalization of quantum mechanics . 3 If the Feynman path integral leads to the well known Schrödinger equation , then the path integral over Lévy trajectories leads to the fractional Schrödinger equation . 4 The Lévy process is characterized by the Lévy index α , 0 S. G. Samko, A. A. Kilbas, and O. I. Marichev, Fractional Integrals and Derivatives, Theory and Applications ~Gordon and Breach, Amsterdam, 1993 This is the key point to launch the term fractional Schrödinger equation and more general term fractional quantum mechanics . As mentioned above, at α = 2 the Lévy motion becomes Brownian motion . Thus, fractional quantum mechanics includes standard quantum mechanics as a particular case at α = 2. The quantum-mechanical path integral over the Lévy paths at α = 2 becomes the well-known Feynman path integral and the fractional Schrödinger equation becomes the well-known Schrödinger equation .  Fractional Schrödinger equation  The fractional Schrödinger equation discovered by Nick Laskin has the following form (see, Refs.[1,3,4])       i  ℏ     ∂  ψ    (  𝐫  ,  t  )     ∂  t     =     D  α     (   -    ℏ  2   Δ    )    α  /  2    ψ   (  𝐫  ,  t  )    +   V   (  𝐫  ,  t  )   ψ   (  𝐫  ,  t  )           i  Planck-constant-over-2-pi        ψ    𝐫  t      t          subscript  D  α    superscript       superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2   normal-Δ      α  2    ψ   𝐫  t      V   𝐫  t   ψ   𝐫  t       i\hbar\frac{\partial\psi(\mathbf{r},t)}{\partial t}=D_{\alpha}(-\hbar^{2}%

Further,   D α is a scale constant with physical dimension [D α ] = [energy] 1 − α ·[length] α [time] − α , at α = 2, D 2 =1/2 m , where m is a particle mass,  the operator (− ħ 2 Δ) α /2 is the 3-dimensional fractional quantum Riesz derivative defined by (see, Refs.[3, 4]);          (-\hbar ^2\Delta )^{\alpha /2}\psi (\mathbf{r},t)=\frac 1{(2\pi \hbar )^3}\int d^3pe^{i \mathbf{p}\cdot \mathbf{r}/\hbar}|\mathbf{p}|^\alpha \varphi ( \mathbf{p},t),  Here, the wave functions in the position and momentum spaces ;    ψ   (  𝐫  ,  t  )       ψ   𝐫  t     \psi(\mathbf{r},t)   and    φ   (  𝐩  ,  t  )       φ   𝐩  t     \varphi(\mathbf{p},t)   are related each other by the 3-dimensional Fourier transforms :         ψ   (  𝐫  ,  t  )    =    1    (   2  π  ℏ   )   3     ∫    d  3   p   e     i  𝐩   ⋅  𝐫   /  ℏ    φ   (  𝐩  ,  t  )       ,    φ   (  𝐩  ,  t  )    =   ∫    d  3   r   e   -     i  𝐩   ⋅  𝐫   /  ℏ     ψ   (  𝐫  ,  t  )       .     formulae-sequence      ψ   𝐫  t        1   superscript    2  π  Planck-constant-over-2-pi   3         superscript  d  3   p   superscript  e     normal-⋅    i  𝐩   𝐫   Planck-constant-over-2-pi    φ   𝐩  t           φ   𝐩  t         superscript  d  3   r   superscript  e       normal-⋅    i  𝐩   𝐫   Planck-constant-over-2-pi     ψ   𝐫  t        \psi(\mathbf{r},t)=\frac{1}{(2\pi\hbar)^{3}}\int d^{3}pe^{i\mathbf{p}\cdot%
