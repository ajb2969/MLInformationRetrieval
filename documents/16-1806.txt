   Variables sampling plan      Variables sampling plan   A variables sampling plan is an acceptance sampling technique. Plans for variables are intended for quality characteristics that are measured in a continuous scale. This plan requires the knowledge of the statistical model e.g. normal distribution . The historical evolution of this technique dates back to the seminal work of Wallis (1943). The purpose of a plan for variables is to assess whether the process is operating far enough from the specification limit. Plans for variables may produce a similar OC curve to attribute plans with significantly less sample size. The decision criterion of these plans are        X  ¯   +   k  σ    ⩽   U  S  L          normal-¯  X     k  σ      U  S  L     \bar{X}+k\sigma\leqslant USL   or      X  ¯   -   k  σ    ⩾   L  S  L          normal-¯  X     k  σ      L  S  L     \bar{X}-k\sigma\geqslant LSL   where    X  ¯     normal-¯  X    \bar{X}   and   σ   σ   \sigma   are the sample mean and the standard deviation respectively,   k   k   k   is the critical distance,    U  S  L      U  S  L    USL   and    L  S  L      L  S  L    LSL   are the upper and lower regulatory limits. When the above expression is satisfied the proportion nonconforming is lower that expected and therefore the lot is accepted.  A variables sampling plan can be designed so that the OC curve passes through two points (AQL,   α   α   \alpha   ) and (LQL,   β   β   \beta   ). AQL and LQL are the Acceptable quality limit and the limiting quality level respectively.   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   are the producer and consumer’s risks. The required sample size (   n   n   n   ) and the critical distance (   k   k   k   ) can be obtained as      k  =      Z   L  Q  L     Z  α    +    Z   A  Q  L     Z  β       Z  α   +   Z  β         k         subscript  Z    L  Q  L     subscript  Z  α       subscript  Z    A  Q  L     subscript  Z  β        subscript  Z  α    subscript  Z  β       k=\frac{Z_{LQL}Z_{\alpha}+Z_{AQL}Z_{\beta}}{Z_{\alpha}+Z_{\beta}}   where   Z   Z   Z   is the normal distribution function.  When the dispersion is known the required sample size (   n   n   n   ) is obtained from      n  =    (     Z  α   +   Z  β      Z   A  Q  L    -   Z   L  Q  L      )   2       n   superscript       subscript  Z  α    subscript  Z  β       subscript  Z    A  Q  L     subscript  Z    L  Q  L      2     n=\left(\frac{Z_{\alpha}+Z_{\beta}}{Z_{AQL}-Z_{LQL}}\right)^{2}     while for unknown   σ   σ   \sigma   the sample size is approximately      n  =     (     Z  α   +   Z  β      Z   A  Q  L    -   Z   L  Q  L      )   2    (   1  +    k  2   2    )        n     superscript       subscript  Z  α    subscript  Z  β       subscript  Z    A  Q  L     subscript  Z    L  Q  L      2     1     superscript  k  2   2       n=\left(\frac{Z_{\alpha}+Z_{\beta}}{Z_{AQL}-Z_{LQL}}\right)^{2}\left(1+\frac{k%
 ^{2}}{2}\right)     The MIL-STD-414 provides tables to obtain the required sample size and the critical distance according to the type of inspection.
