   Point-to-point Lee model      Point-to-point Lee model   The Lee model for point-to-point mode is a radio propagation model that operates around 900 MHz. Built as two different modes, this model includes an adjustment factor that can be adjusted to make the model more flexible to different regions of propagation.  Applicable to/under conditions  This model is suitable for using in data collected in a specific area for point-to-point links.  Coverage  Frequency : 900 MHz band  Mathematical formulation  The model  The Lee model for point to point mode is formally expressed as:      L  =      L  0    +   γ  g   log   d      -   10   (    log   F  A    -   2   log   (    H   E  T    30   )      )         L       subscript  L  0     γ  g    d       10       subscript  F  A      2       subscript  H    E  T    30          L=L_{0}\;+\;\gamma g\log d\;-10(\log{F_{A}}-2\log(\frac{H_{ET}}{30}))     where,  L = The median  path loss .
