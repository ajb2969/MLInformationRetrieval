   Theta function of a lattice      Theta function of a lattice   In mathematics , the theta function of a lattice is a function whose coefficients give the number of vectors of a given norm.  Definition  One can associate to any (positive-definite) lattice Λ a theta function given by         Θ  Λ    (  τ  )    =    ∑   x  ∈  Λ     e   i  π  τ    ∥  x  ∥   2          Im   τ   >  0.      formulae-sequence       subscript  normal-Θ  normal-Λ   τ     subscript     x  normal-Λ     superscript  e    i  π  τ   superscript   norm  x   2           Im  τ   0.     \Theta_{\Lambda}(\tau)=\sum_{x\in\Lambda}e^{i\pi\tau\|x\|^{2}}\qquad\mathrm{Im%
 }\,\tau>0.     The theta function of a lattice is then a holomorphic function on the upper half-plane . Furthermore, the theta function of an even unimodular lattice of rank n is actually a modular form of weight n /2. The theta function of an integral lattice is often written as a power series in    q  =   e   2  i  π  τ        q   superscript  e    2  i  π  τ      q=e^{2i\pi\tau}   so that the coefficient of q n gives the number of lattice vectors of norm 2 n .
