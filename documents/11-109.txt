Oxalate—CoA ligase




Oxalate—CoA ligase

In enzymology, an oxalate-CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + oxalate + CoA 
 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + oxalyl-CoA
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, oxalate, and CoA, whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and oxalyl-CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is oxalate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include oxalyl-CoA synthetase, and oxalyl coenzyme A synthetase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
Organisms with Oxalate-CoA Ligases include:
Arabidopsis thaliana1
Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2
