Fusion frame

In mathematics, a fusion frame of a vector space is a natural extension of a frame. It is an additive construct of several, potentially "overlapping" frames. The motivation for this concept comes from the event that a signal can not be acquired by a single sensor alone (a constraint found by limitations of hardware or data throughput), rather the partial components of the signal must be collected via a network of sensors, and the partial signal representations are then fused into the complete signal.
By construction, fusion frames easily lend themselves to parallel or distributed processing1 of sensor networks consisting of arbitrary overlapping sensor fields.
Definition
Given a Hilbert space

 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be closed subspaces of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an index set. Let 
 
 
 
  be a set of scalar weights. Then 
 
 
 
  is a fusion frame of 
 
 
 
  if there exist constants 
 
 
 
  such that for all 
 
 
 
  we have


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  denotes the orthogonal projection onto the subspace 
 
 
 
 .
Local frame representation
Let 
 
 
 
  be a closed subspace, and let 
 
 
 
  be an orthonormal basis of 
 
 
 
 . Then for all 
 
 
 
 , the orthogonal projection of 
 
 
 
  onto 
 
 
 
  is given by

Fusion frame operator
For finite frames (i.e., 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ), the fusion frame operator can be constructed with a matrix.3 Let 
 
 
 
  be a fusion frame for 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be a frame for the subspace 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  an index set for each 
 
 
 
 . With



and



where 
 
 
 
  is the canonical dual frame of 
 
 
 
 , the fusion frame operator 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
 .
The fusion frame operator 
 
 
 
  is then given by an 
 
 
 
  matrix.
