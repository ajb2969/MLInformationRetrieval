   Nagata–Biran conjecture      Nagata–Biran conjecture   In mathematics , the Nagata–Biran conjecture, named after Masayoshi Nagata and Paul Biran , is a generalisation of the Nagata conjecture to arbitrary polarised surfaces.  Let X be a smooth algebraic surface and L be an ample line bundle on X of degree d . The Nagata–Biran conjecture states that for sufficiently large r the Seshadri constant satisfies        ε   (   p  1   ,  …  ,   p  r   ;  X  ,  L  )    =   d   r     .        ε    subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  r   X  L      d    r      \varepsilon(p_{1},\ldots,p_{r};X,L)={d\over\sqrt{r}}.
