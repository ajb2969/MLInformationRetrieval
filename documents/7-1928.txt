Data was calculated as follows       ∫  γ    ρ   (   h  ∘  γ   )   d  s       subscript   γ     ρ    h  γ   d  s     \int_{\gamma}\rho(h\circ\gamma)\,ds   where γ is the path from where the sun hits the atmosphere along the line of sight, and continues in the direction of the oberserver's horizon. ρ is taken to be the usual isothermal atmospheric density. The integral is normalized so that the path from ground to zenith is exactly 1 airmass. The earth's curvature was taken into account.  Licensing  "
