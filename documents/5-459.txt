Time of flight detector

A time of flight (TOF) detector is a particle detector which can discriminate between a lighter and a heavier elementary particle of same momentum using their time of flight between two scintillators. The first of the scintillators activates a clock upon being hit while the other stops the clock upon being hit. If the two masses are denoted by 
 
 
 
 and 
 
 
 
  and have velocities 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then the time of flight difference is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the distance between the scintillators. The approximation is in the relativistic limit at momentum 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes the speed of light in vacuum. Usually, 
 
 
 
  is the apparatus' time resolution (~200 ps).
