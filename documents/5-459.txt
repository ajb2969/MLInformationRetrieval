   Time of flight detector      Time of flight detector   A time of flight (TOF) detector is a particle detector which can discriminate between a lighter and a heavier elementary particle of same momentum using their time of flight between two scintillators . The first of the scintillators activates a clock upon being hit while the other stops the clock upon being hit. If the two masses are denoted by    m  1     subscript  m  1    m_{1}   and    m  2     subscript  m  2    m_{2}   and have velocities    v  1     subscript  v  1    v_{1}   and    v  2     subscript  v  2    v_{2}   then the time of flight difference is given by       δ  t   =   L   (    1   v  1    -   1   v  2     )    ≈     L  c    2   p  2      (    m  1  2   -   m  2  2    )            δ  t     L      1   subscript  v  1      1   subscript  v  2                 L  c     2   superscript  p  2        superscript   subscript  m  1   2    superscript   subscript  m  2   2        \delta t=L\left(\frac{1}{v_{1}}-\frac{1}{v_{2}}\right)\approx\frac{Lc}{2p^{2}}%
 (m_{1}^{2}-m_{2}^{2})   where   L   L   L   is the distance between the scintillators. The approximation is in the relativistic limit at momentum   p   p   p   and   c   c   c   denotes the speed of light in vacuum. Usually,    δ  t      δ  t    \delta t   is the apparatus' time resolution (~200 ps).  See also   Time-of-flight  Time-of-flight mass spectrometry   "  Category:Particle detectors
