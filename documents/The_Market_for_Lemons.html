<h1>The Market for Lemons</h1>
<hr/>

<p> <strong>"The Market for Lemons: Quality Uncertainty and the Market Mechanism"</strong> is a 1970 paper by the economist <a href="George_Akerlof" title="wikilink">George Akerlof</a>. It discusses <a href="information_asymmetry" title="wikilink">information asymmetry</a>, which occurs when the seller knows more about a product than the buyer. A <a href="lemon_(automobile)" title="wikilink">lemon</a> is an American slang term for a car that is found to be defective only after it has been bought. Akerlof, <a href="Michael_Spence" title="wikilink">Michael Spence</a>, and <a href="Joseph_Stiglitz" title="wikilink">Joseph Stiglitz</a> jointly received the <a href="Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences" title="wikilink">Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences</a> in 2001 for their research related to asymmetric information. Akerlof's paper uses the <a href="Market_(economics)" title="wikilink">market</a> for <a href="used_car" title="wikilink">used cars</a> as an example of the problem of quality uncertainty.

<h2 id="thesis">Thesis</h2>

<p> Akerlof's paper uses the <a href="market_(economics)" title="wikilink">market</a> for <a href="used_car" title="wikilink">used cars</a> as an example of the problem of quality uncertainty. A used car is one in which ownership is transferred from one person to another, after a period of use by its first owner and its inevitable wear and tear. There are good used cars ("cherries") and defective used cars ("lemons"), normally as a consequence of several not-always-traceable variables, such as the owner's driving style, quality and frequency of maintenance, and accident history. Because many important mechanical parts and other elements are hidden from view and not easily accessible for inspection, the buyer of a car does not know beforehand whether it is a cherry or a lemon. So the buyer's best guess for a given car is that the car is of average quality; accordingly, he/she will be willing to pay for it only the price of a car of known average quality. This means that the owner of a carefully maintained, never-abused, good used car will be unable to get a high enough price to make selling that car worthwhile.</p>

<p>Therefore, owners of good cars will not place their cars on the used car market. The withdrawal of good cars reduces the average quality of cars on the market, causing buyers to revise downward their expectations for any given car. This, in turn, motivates the owners of moderately good cars not to sell, and so on. The result is that a market in which there is <a href="information_asymmetry" title="wikilink">asymmetric information</a> with respect to quality shows characteristics similar to those described by <a href="Gresham's_Law" title="wikilink">Gresham's Law</a>: the bad drives out the good. (Although Gresham's principle applies more specifically to exchange rates, modified analogies can be drawn.) <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

 is any arbitrary positive price, it is shown that no cars will be sold at any positive price at all. The market for used cars collapses when there is asymmetric information.</p>
<h2 id="asymmetric-information">Asymmetric information</h2>

<p>The paper by Akerlof describes how the interaction between quality heterogeneity and <a href="information_asymmetry" title="wikilink">asymmetric information</a> can lead to the disappearance of a market where guarantees are indefinite. In this model, as quality is undistinguishable beforehand by the buyer (due to the asymmetry of information), incentives exist for the seller to pass off low-quality goods as higher-quality ones. The buyer, however, takes this incentive into consideration, and takes the quality of the goods to be uncertain. Only the average quality of the goods will be considered, which in turn will have the side effect that goods that are above average in terms of quality will be driven out of the market. This mechanism is repeated until a <a href="no-trade_equilibrium" title="wikilink">no-trade equilibrium</a> is reached.</p>

<p>As a consequence of the mechanism described in this paper, markets may fail to exist altogether in certain situations involving quality uncertainty. Examples given in Akerlof's paper include the market for used cars, the dearth of formal credit markets in developing countries, and the difficulties that the elderly encounter in buying health insurance. However, not all players in a given market will follow the same rules or have the same aptitude of assessing quality. So there will always be a distinct advantage for some vendors to offer low-quality goods to the less-informed segment of a market that, on the whole, appears to be of reasonable quality and have reasonable guarantees of certainty. This is part of the basis for the idiom <a href="buyer_beware" title="wikilink">buyer beware</a>.</p>

<p>This is likely the basis for the idiom that an <a href="informed_consumer" title="wikilink">informed consumer</a> is a better consumer. An example of this might be the subjective quality of fine food and wine. Individual consumers know best what they prefer to eat, and quality is almost always assessed in fine establishments by smell and taste before they pay. That is, if a customer in a fine establishment orders a lobster and the meat is not fresh, he can send the lobster back to the kitchen and refuse to pay for it. However, a definition of 'highest quality' for food eludes providers. Thus, a large variety of better-quality and higher-priced restaurants are supported.</p>
<h2 id="critical-reception">Critical reception</h2>

<p>George E. Hoffer and Michael D. Pratt state that the “economic literature is divided on whether a lemons market actually exists in used vehicles”. The authors’ research supports the hypothesis that “known defects provisions”, used by US states (e.g., Wisconsin) to regulate used car sales, have been ineffectual, because the quality of used vehicles sold in these states is not significantly better than the vehicles in neighboring states without such consumer protection legislation.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Both the <em><a href="American_Economic_Review" title="wikilink">American Economic Review</a></em> and the <em><a href="Review_of_Economic_Studies" title="wikilink">Review of Economic Studies</a></em> rejected the paper for "triviality", while the reviewers for <em><a href="Journal_of_Political_Economy" title="wikilink">Journal of Political Economy</a></em> rejected it as incorrect, arguing that, if this paper were correct, then no goods could be traded.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> Only on the fourth attempt did the paper get published in <em><a href="Quarterly_Journal_of_Economics" title="wikilink">Quarterly Journal of Economics</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Today, the paper is one of the most-cited papers in modern economic theory (more than 8,530 citations in academic papers as of May 2011).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It has profoundly influenced virtually every field of economics, from industrial organisation and public finance to macroeconomics and contract theory.</p>
<h2 id="criteria">Criteria</h2>

<p>A lemon market will be produced by the following:</p>
<ol>
<li>Asymmetry of information, in which no buyers can accurately assess the value of a product through examination before sale is made and all sellers can more accurately assess the value of a product prior to sale</li>
<li>An incentive exists for the seller to pass off a low-quality product as a higher-quality one</li>
<li>Sellers have no credible disclosure technology (sellers with a great car have no way to disclose this credibly to buyers)</li>
<li>Either a continuum of seller qualities exists or the average seller type is sufficiently low (buyers are sufficiently pessimistic about the seller's quality)</li>
<li>Deficiency of <em>effective</em> public quality assurances (by reputation or regulation and/or of <em>effective</em> guarantees/warranties)</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="impact-on-markets">Impact on markets</h2>

<p>The article draws some conclusions about the cost of dishonesty in markets in general:</p>
<h2 id="laws-in-the-united-states">Laws in the United States</h2>

<p>Five years after Akerlof's paper was published, the United States enacted a federal "lemon law" (the <a href="Magnuson–Moss_Warranty_Act" title="wikilink">Magnuson–Moss Warranty Act</a>) that protects citizens of all states. There are also state laws regarding "lemons" which vary by state and may not necessarily cover used or leased vehicles. The rights afforded to consumers by "lemon laws" may exceed the warranties expressed in purchase contracts. These state laws provide remedies to consumers for automobiles that repeatedly fail to meet certain standards of quality and performance. "Lemon law" is the common nickname for these laws, but each state has different names for the laws and acts, which may also cover more than just automobiles. In California and federal law, "Lemon Laws" cover anything mechanical.</p>

<p>The federal "lemon law" also provides the warrantor may be obligated to pay your attorney fees if you prevail in a lemon , as do most state lemon laws. If a car has to be repaired for the same defect four or more times and the problem is still occurring, the car may be deemed to be "a lemon". The defect must substantially hinder the vehicle's use, value, or safety. Purchasers who knowingly purchase a car in "as is" condition accept the defects and void their rights under the "lemon law".</p>
<h2 id="criticism">Criticism</h2>

<p>Criticism for this theory stems from the fact that it ignores that consumers themselves can seek ways to assure the quality of a car and that a used-car salesperson may work to maintain his reputation rather than pass off a "lemon". The issue of reputation, however, would not apply to private individual sellers who do not intend to sell another car in the near future. </p>

<p><a href="Libertarianism" title="wikilink">Libertarians</a>, like William L. Anderson, oppose the regulatory approach proposed by the authors of the paper, observing that some used-car markets haven't broken down even without lemon legislation and that the lemon problem creates entrepreneurial opportunities for alternative marketplaces or customers' knowledgeable friends.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
