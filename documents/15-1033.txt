5-nitrosalicylate dioxygenase

5-nitrosalicylate dioxygenase (, naaB (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 5-nitrosalicylate:oxygen 1,2-oxidoreductase (decyclizing).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

5-nitrosalicylate + O2

 
  2-oxo-3-(5-oxofuran-2-ylidene)propanoate + nitrite (overall reaction)
 
(1a) 5-nitrosalicylate + O2

 
  4-nitro-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienedioate
 
(1b) 4-nitro-6-oxohepta-2,4-dienedioate 
 
 
 
  2-oxo-3-(5-oxofuran-2-ylidene)propanoate + nitrite (spontaneous reaction)
 

The enzyme from soil bacterium Bradyrhizobium sp. JS329 participates in 5-nitroanthranilate degradation.
