   Papyrus 4      Papyrus 4   Papyrus 4 (   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    4 , part of Suppl. Gr. 1120 ) is an early New Testament papyrus of the Gospel of Luke in Greek . It is dated as being a late 2nd/early 3rd century manuscript .  Description  It is one of the earliest manuscripts (along with P 75 ) 1 of the Gospel of Luke and contains extensive sections of its first six chapters. 2 It is currently housed in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (Suppl. Gr. 1120) in Paris.  It contains texts of Luke: 1:58-59; 1:62-2:1; 2:6-7; 3:8-4:2; 4:29-32, 34-35; 5:3-8; 5:30-6:16  The Greek text-type of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian . Aland placed it in Category I . 3 There is agreement with Papyrus 75 in 93%. 4   Notable readings   In Luke 6:2 — οὐκ ἔξεστιν ( not lawful ) for οὐκ ἔξεστιν ποιεῖν ( not lawful to do ); the reading is supported only by Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209 , ( Codex Bezae ), Codex Nitriensis , 700 , lat, cop sa , cop bo , arm, geo; 5  P 4 was used as stuffing for the binding of "a codex of Philo, written in the later third century and found in a jar which had been walled up in a house at Coptos [in 250]." 6  Philip Comfort and David Barret in their book Text of the Earliest NT Greek Manuscripts argue that P 4 came from the same codex as P 64/67 , the Magdalen papyrus , and date the texts to 150-175. 7 Willker tentatively agrees stating 'The [3rd century] dating given is that of NA . Some date it into the 2nd CE (e.g. Roberts and Comfort). This is quite probable considering the use as binding material for a 3rd CE codex'. 8 Comfort and Barret also show that   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    4 and [[Magdalen papyrus|P 64+67]] have affinities with a number of late 2nd century papyri. 9 Roberts (1979), Skeat (1997), 10 Willker 11 and Stanton 12 also date the text to the late 2nd century, leading Gregory to conclude that '[t]here is good reason to believe that P 4 ... may have been written late in the 2nd century...'. 13 Most recently Charlesworth has concluded 'that P 64+67 and P 4 , though written by the same scribe, are not from the same ... codex.' 14  See also   List of New Testament papyri   Notes  References   Charlesworth, SD (2007) T.
