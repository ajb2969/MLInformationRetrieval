   Dual (category theory)      Dual (category theory)    For general notions of duality in mathematics, see duality (mathematics) .    In category theory , a branch of mathematics , duality is a correspondence between properties of a category C and so-called dual properties of the opposite category  C op . Given a statement regarding the category C , by interchanging the source and target of each morphism as well as interchanging the order of composing two morphisms, a corresponding dual statement is obtained regarding the opposite category C op . Duality , as such, is the assertion that truth is invariant under this operation on statements. In other words, if a statement is true about C , then its dual statement is true about C op . Also, if a statement is false about C , then its dual has to be false about C op .  Given a concrete category  C , it is often the case that the opposite category C op per se is abstract. C op need not be a category that arises from mathematical practice. In this case, another category D is also termed to be in duality with C if D and C op are equivalent as categories .  In the case when C and its opposite C op are equivalent, such a category is self-dual . 1  Formal definition  We define the elementary language of category theory as the two-sorted first order language with objects and morphisms as distinct sorts, together with the relations of an object being the source or target of a morphism and a symbol for composing two morphisms.  Let σ be any statement in this language. We form the dual σ op as follows:   Interchange each occurrence of "source" in σ with "target".  Interchange the order of composing morphisms. That is, replace each occurrence of    g  ∘  f      g  f    g\circ f   with    f  ∘  g      f  g    f\circ g      Informally, these conditions state that the dual of a statement is formed by reversing arrows and compositions .  Duality is the observation that σ is true for some category C if and only if σ op is true for C op .  Examples   A morphism    f  :   A  →  B      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  B     f\colon A\to B   is a monomorphism if     f  ∘  g   =   f  ∘  h         f  g     f  h     f\circ g=f\circ h   implies    g  =  h      g  h    g=h   . Performing the dual operation, we get the statement that     g  ∘  f   =   h  ∘  f         g  f     h  f     g\circ f=h\circ f   implies     g  =  h   .      g  h    g=h.   For a morphism    f  :   B  →  A      normal-:  f   normal-→  B  A     f\colon B\to A   , this is precisely what it means for f to be an epimorphism . In short, the property of being a monomorphism is dual to the property of being an epimorphism.   Applying duality, this means that a morphism in some category C is a monomorphism if and only if the reverse morphism in the opposite category C op is an epimorphism.   An example comes from reversing the direction of inequalities in a partial order . So if X is a set and ≤ a partial order relation, we can define a new partial order relation ≤ new by     x ≤ new  y if and only if y ≤ x .     This example on orders is a special case, since partial orders correspond to a certain kind of category in which Hom( A , B ) can have at most one element. In applications to logic, this then looks like a very general description of negation (that is, proofs run in the opposite direction). For example, if we take the opposite of a lattice , we will find that meets and joins have their roles interchanged. This is an abstract form of De Morgan's laws , or of duality applied to lattices.   Limits and colimits are dual notions.    Fibrations and cofibrations are examples of dual notions in algebraic topology and homotopy theory . In this context, the duality is often called Eckmann–Hilton duality .
