   F. and M. Riesz theorem      F. and M. Riesz theorem   In mathematics , the F. and M. Riesz theorem is a result of the brothers Frigyes Riesz and Marcel Riesz , on analytic measures . It states that for a measure μ on the circle , any part of μ that is not absolutely continuous with respect to the Lebesgue measure  d θ can be detected by means of Fourier coefficients . More precisely, it states that if the Fourier–Stieltjes coefficients of   μ   μ   \mu   satisfy         μ  ^   n   =    ∫  0   2  π      e   -   i  n  θ       d  μ   (  θ  )     2  π      =  0   ,         subscript   normal-^  μ   n     superscript   subscript   0     2  π       superscript  normal-e      i  n  θ         d  μ  θ     2  π           0     \hat{\mu}_{n}=\int_{0}^{2\pi}{\rm e}^{-in\theta}\frac{d\mu(\theta)}{2\pi}=0,   for all    n  <  0      n  0    n<0   , then μ is absolutely continuous with respect to d θ.  The original statements are rather different (see Zygmund, Trigonometric Series , VII.8). The formulation here is as in Rudin, Real and Complex Analysis , p.335. The proof given uses the Poisson kernel and the existence of boundary values for the Hardy space  H 1 .  References   F. and M.
