Bott–Samelson variety

In mathematics, Bott–Samelson varieties were introduced independently by  and  (who named them Bott–Samelson varieties) as an algebraic group analogue of the spaces constructed for compact groups by . They are sometimes desingularizations of Schubert varieties.
A Bott–Samelson variety Z can be constructed as


 
  where B is a Borel subgroup of a reductive algebraic group G and the Ps are minimal parabolic subgroups containing B. (An element b of B acts on P on the right as right multiplication by b and acts on P on the left as left multiplication by b−1.) Taking the product of its coordinates gives a proper map from the Bott–Samelson variety Z to the flag variety G/B whose image is a Schubert variety. In some cases this map is birational and gives a desingularization of the Schubert variety.
