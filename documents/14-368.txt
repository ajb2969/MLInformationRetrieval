   Helly space      Helly space   In mathematics, and particularly functional analysis , the Helly space , named after Eduard Helly , consists of all monotonically increasing  functions , where [0,1] denotes the closed interval given by the set of all x such that 1 In other words, for all  we have  and also if  then  Let the closed interval [0,1] be denoted simply by I . We can form the space I I by taking the uncountable  Cartesian product of closed intervals: 2       I  I   =    ∏   i  ∈  I     I  i         superscript  I  I     subscript  product    i  I     subscript  I  i      I^{I}=\prod_{i\in I}I_{i}   The space I I is exactly the space of functions . For each point x in [0,1] we assign the point ƒ( x ) in 3  Topology  The Helly space is a subset of ''I I'' . The space ''I I'' has its own topology, namely the product topology . 4 The Helly space has a topology; namely the induced topology as a subset of ''I I'' . 5  References  "  Category:Functional analysis     ↩  ↩  ↩
