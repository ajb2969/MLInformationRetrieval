Helly space

In mathematics, and particularly functional analysis, the Helly space, named after Eduard Helly, consists of all monotonically increasing functions , where [0,1] denotes the closed interval given by the set of all x such that 1 In other words, for all  we have  and also if  then 
Let the closed interval [0,1] be denoted simply by I. We can form the space II by taking the uncountable Cartesian product of closed intervals:2


 
  The space II is exactly the space of functions . For each point x in [0,1] we assign the point Æ’(x) in 3
Topology
The Helly space is a subset of ''II''. The space ''II'' has its own topology, namely the product topology.4 The Helly space has a topology; namely the induced topology as a subset of ''II''.5
