   Carmichael number      Carmichael number   In number theory , a Carmichael number is a composite number    n   n   n   which satisfies the modular arithmetic congruence relation:       b   n  -  1    ≡   1     (   mod  n   )         superscript  b    n  1     annotated  1   pmod  n      b^{n-1}\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n)   for all integers   n   n   n   . They are named for Robert Carmichael . The Carmichael numbers are the subset K 1 of the Knödel numbers .  Overview  Fermat's little theorem states that that if p is a prime number , then for any integer  b , the number b  p − b is an integer multiple of p . Carmichael numbers are composite numbers which have the same property of modular arithmetic congruence. In fact, Carmichael numbers are also called Fermat pseudoprimes or absolute Fermat pseudoprimes . Carmichael numbers are important because they pass the Fermat primality test but are not actually prime. Since Carmichael numbers exist, this primality test cannot be relied upon to prove the primality of a number, although it can still be used to prove a number is composite. This makes tests based on Fermat's Little Theorem risky compared to other more stringent tests such as the Solovay-Strassen primality test or a strong pseudoprime test. Still, as numbers become larger, Carmichael numbers become very rare. For example, there are 20,138,200 Carmichael numbers between 1 and 10 21 (approximately one in 50 trillion (5*10 13 ) numbers). 1  Korselt's criterion  An alternative and equivalent definition of Carmichael numbers is given by Korselt's criterion .   Theorem ( A. Korselt 1899): A positive composite integer   n   n   n   is a Carmichael number if and only if   p   p   p   is square-free , and for all prime divisors    n   n   n   of    p  -  1  ∣  n  -  1     fragments  p   1  normal-∣  n   1    p-1\mid n-1   , it is true that    p  -  1  ∣  n  -  1     fragments  p   1  normal-∣  n   1    p-1\mid n-1   .   It follows from this theorem that all Carmichael numbers are odd , since any even composite number that is square-free (and hence has only one prime factor of two) will have at least one odd prime factor, and thus    -  1      1    -1   results in an even dividing an odd, a contradiction. (The oddness of Carmichael numbers also follows from the fact that    561  =   3  ⋅  11  ⋅  17       561   normal-⋅  3  11  17     561=3\cdot 11\cdot 17   is a Fermat witness for any even composite number.) From the criterion it also follows that Carmichael numbers are cyclic . 2 3  Discovery  Korselt was the first who observed the basic properties of Carmichael numbers, but he could not find any examples. In 1910, Carmichael 4 found the first and smallest such number, 561, which explains the name "Carmichael number".  That 561 is a Carmichael number can be seen with Korselt's criterion. Indeed,    2  ∣  560     fragments  2  normal-∣  560    2\mid 560   is square-free and    10  ∣  560     fragments  10  normal-∣  560    10\mid 560   ,    16  ∣  560     fragments  16  normal-∣  560    16\mid 560   and    1105  =  5  ⋅  13  ⋅  17   (  4  ∣  1104  ;  12  ∣  1104  ;  16  ∣  1104  )      fragments  1105   5  normal-⋅  13  normal-⋅  17  italic-   fragments  normal-(  4  normal-∣  1104  normal-;  12  normal-∣  1104  normal-;  16  normal-∣  1104  normal-)     1105=5\cdot 13\cdot 17\qquad(4\mid 1104;\quad 12\mid 1104;\quad 16\mid 1104)   .

His work, however, remained unnoticed.  J. Chernick 6 proved a theorem in 1939 which can be used to construct a subset of Carmichael numbers. The number   n   n   n   is a Carmichael number if its three factors are all prime. Whether this formula produces an infinite quantity of Carmichael numbers is an open question (though it is implied by Dickson's conjecture ).  Paul Erdős heuristically argued there should be infinitely many Carmichael numbers. In 1994 it was shown by W. R. (Red) Alford , Andrew Granville and Carl Pomerance that there really do exist infinitely many Carmichael numbers. Specifically, they showed that for sufficiently large    n   2  /  7      superscript  n    2  7     n^{2/7}   , there are at least   n   n   n   Carmichael numbers between 1 and    k  =   3  ,  4  ,  5  ,  …       k   3  4  5  normal-…     k=3,4,5,\ldots   . 7  Löh and Niebuhr in 1992 found some very large Carmichael numbers, including one with 1,101,518 factors and over 16 million digits.

In 1956, Erdős improved the bound to 9      k  2     subscript  k  2    k_{2}     for some constant    C   (  X  )       C  X    C(X)   . He further gave a heuristic argument suggesting that this upper bound should be close to the true growth rate of    X  =   10  n       X   superscript  10  n     X=10^{n}   . The table below gives approximate minimal values for the constant k in the Erdős bound for   n   n   n   as n grows:             C   (  X  )    >   X   2  7     .

Regarding the asymptotic distribution of Carmichael numbers, there have been several conjectures. In 1956, Erdős 12 conjectured that there were    X   1  -     {   1  +   o   (  1  )     }    log   log   log  X       log   log  X         superscript  X    1         1    o  1           X          X        X^{1-{\frac{\{1+o(1)\}\log\log\log X}{\log\log X}}}   Carmichael numbers for X sufficiently large. In 1981, Pomerance 13 sharpened Erdős' heuristic arguments to conjecture that there are     𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}     Carmichael numbers up to X . However, inside current computational ranges (such as the counts of Carmichael numbers performed by Pinch 14 up to 10 21 ), these conjectures are not yet borne out by the data.  Generalizations  The notion of Carmichael number generalizes to a Carmichael ideal in any number field K . For any nonzero prime ideal    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    {\mathcal{O}}_{K}   in     α   N   (  𝔭  )     ≡   α  mod  𝔭        superscript  α    normal-N  𝔭     modulo  α  𝔭     \alpha^{{\rm N}(\mathfrak{p})}\equiv\alpha\bmod{\mathfrak{p}}   , we have   α   α   \alpha   for all    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    {\mathcal{O}}_{K}   in    N   (  𝔭  )       normal-N  𝔭    {\rm N}(\mathfrak{p})   , where   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is the norm of the ideal     m  p   ≡   m  mod  p        superscript  m  p    modulo  m  p     m^{p}\equiv m\bmod p   . (This generalizes Fermat's little theorem, that   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   for all integers m when p is prime.) Call a nonzero ideal    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    {\mathcal{O}}_{K}   in     α   N   (  𝔞  )     ≡   α  mod  𝔞        superscript  α    normal-N  𝔞     modulo  α  𝔞     \alpha^{{\rm N}(\mathfrak{a})}\equiv\alpha\bmod{\mathfrak{a}}   Carmichael if it is not a prime ideal and    α  ∈   𝒪  K       α   subscript  𝒪  K     \alpha\in{\mathcal{O}}_{K}   for all    N   (  𝔞  )       normal-N  𝔞    {\rm N}(\mathfrak{a})   , where   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   is the norm of the ideal   𝐐   𝐐   \mathbf{Q}   . When K is   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , the ideal    𝔞  =   (  a  )       𝔞  a    \mathfrak{a}=(a)   is principal, and if we let a be its positive generator then the ideal    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    {\mathcal{O}}_{K}   is Carmichael exactly when a is a Carmichael number in the usual sense.  When K is larger than the rationals it is easy to write down Carmichael ideals in    p   𝒪  K       p   subscript  𝒪  K     p{\mathcal{O}}_{K}   : for any prime number p that splits completely in K , the principal ideal    𝒪  K     subscript  𝒪  K    {\mathcal{O}}_{K}   is a Carmichael ideal. Since infinitely many prime numbers split completely in any number field, there are infinitely many Carmichael ideals in     gcd   (    ∑   x  =  1    n  -  1     x   n  -  1     ,  n  )    =  1          superscript   subscript     x  1      n  1     superscript  x    n  1     n   1    \gcd\left(\sum_{x=1}^{n-1}x^{n-1},n\right)=1   . For example, if p is any prime number that is 1 mod 4, the ideal ( p ) in the Gaussian integers Z [ i ] is a Carmichael ideal.  Both prime and Carmichael numbers satisfy the following equality:      10  12     superscript  10  12    10^{12}     Higher-order Carmichael numbers  Carmichael numbers can be generalized using concepts of abstract algebra .  The above definition states that a composite integer n is Carmichael precisely when the n th-power-raising function p n from the ring  Z n of integers modulo n to itself is the identity function. The identity is the only Z n - algebra  endomorphism on Z n so we can restate the definition as asking that p n be an algebra endomorphism of Z n . As above, p n satisfies the same property whenever n is prime.  The n th-power-raising function p n is also defined on any Z n -algebra A . A theorem states that n is prime if and only if all such functions p n are algebra endomorphisms.  In-between these two conditions lies the definition of Carmichael number of order m for any positive integer m as any composite number n such that p n is an endomorphism on every Z n -algebra that can be generated as Z n - module by m elements. Carmichael numbers of order 1 are just the ordinary Carmichael numbers.  An order 2 Carmichael number  According to Howe, 17 · 31 · 41 · 43 · 89 · 97 · 167 · 331 is an order 2 Carmichael number. This product is equal to 443,372,888,629,441.  Properties  Korselt's criterion can be generalized to higher-order Carmichael numbers, as shown by Howe. 15  A heuristic argument, given in the same paper, appears to suggest that there are infinitely many Carmichael numbers of order m , for any m . However, not a single Carmichael number of order 3 or above is known.
