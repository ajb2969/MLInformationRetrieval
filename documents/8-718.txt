   Cyclotomic unit      Cyclotomic unit   In mathematics, a cyclotomic unit (or circular unit ) is a unit of an algebraic number field which is the product of numbers of the form (ζ − 1) for ζ an n th  root of unity and 0 Washington, Theorem 8.2  Note also that if n is a composite number , the subgroup of cyclotomic units generated by (ζ − 1)/(ζ − 1)with ( a , n ) = 1 is not of finite index in general. 1  The cyclotomic units satisfy distribution relations . Let a be a rational number prime to p and let g a denote exp(2πi a )−1. Then for a ≠ 0 we have      ∏    p  b   =  a     g  b    =   g  a         subscript  product      p  b   a     subscript  g  b     subscript  g  a     \prod_{pb=a}g_{b}=g_{a}   . 2  Using these distribution relations and the symmetry relation ζ − 1 = -ζ (ζ − 1) a basis B n of the cyclotomic units can be constructed with the property that B d ⊆ B n for d | n . 3  See also   Elliptic unit  Modular unit   References       "  Category:Algebraic number theory  Category:Cyclotomic fields     Washington, 8.8, page 150, for n equal to 55. ↩  Lang (1990) p.157 ↩  http://perisic.com/cyclotomic ↩
