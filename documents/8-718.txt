Cyclotomic unit

In mathematics, a cyclotomic unit (or circular unit) is a unit of an algebraic number field which is the product of numbers of the form (ζ − 1) for ζ an nth root of unity and 0 Washington, Theorem 8.2
Note also that if n is a composite number, the subgroup of cyclotomic units generated by (ζ − 1)/(ζ − 1)with (a, n) = 1 is not of finite index in general.1
The cyclotomic units satisfy distribution relations. Let a be a rational number prime to p and let ga denote exp(2πia)−1. Then for a≠ 0 we have

Using these distribution relations and the symmetry relation ζ − 1 = -ζ (ζ − 1) a basis Bn of the cyclotomic units can be constructed with the property that Bd ⊆ Bn for d | n.3
