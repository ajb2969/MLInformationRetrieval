Källén–Lehmann spectral representation

The Källén–Lehmann spectral representation gives a general expression for the two-point function of an interacting quantum field theory as a sum of free propagators. It was discovered by Gunnar Källén and Harry Lehmann independently.12 This can be written as



being 
 
 
 
  the spectral density function that should be positive definite. In a gauge theory, this latter condition cannot be granted but nevertheless a spectral representation can be provided.3 This belongs to non-perturbative techniques of quantum field theory.
Mathematical derivation
In order to derive a spectral representation for the propagator of a field 
 
 
 
 , one consider a complete set of states 
 
 
 
 
  so that, for the two-point function one can write



We can now use Poincaré invariance of the vacuum to write down



Let us introduce the spectral density function


 
 .
We have used the fact that our two-point function, being a function of 
 
 
 
 , can only depend on 
 
 
 
 
 . Besides, all the intermediate states have 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It is immediate to realize that the spectral density function is real and positive. So, one can write



and we freely interchange the integration, this should be done carefully from a mathematical standpoint but here we ignore this, and write this expression as



being


 
 .
From CPT theorem we also know that holds an identical expression for 
 
 
 
  and so we arrive at the expression for the chronologically ordered product of fields



being now



a free particle propagator. Now, as we have the exact propagator given by the chronologically ordered two-point function, we have obtained the spectral decomposition.
