Destructive dilemma

Destructive dilemma12 is the name of a valid rule of inference of propositional logic. It is the inference that, if P implies Q and R implies S and either Q is false or S is false, then either P or R must be false. In sum, if two conditionals are true, but one of their consequents is false, then one of their antecedents has to be false. Destructive dilemma is the disjunctive version of modus tollens. The disjunctive version of modus ponens is the constructive dilemma. The rule can be stated:



where the rule is that wherever instances of "
 
 
 
 ", "
 
 
 
 ", and "
 
 
 
 " appear on lines of a proof, "
 
 
 
 " can be placed on a subsequent line.
Formal notation
The destructive dilemma rule may be written in sequent notation:



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  in some logical system;
and expressed as a truth-functional tautology or theorem of propositional logic:



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
Natural language example

If it rains, we will stay inside.
 
If it is sunny, we will go for a walk.
 
Either we will not stay inside, or we will not go for a walk, or both.
 
Therefore, either it will not rain, or it will not be sunny, or both.
