   ATP deaminase      ATP deaminase   In enzymology , an ATP deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ITP + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ITP and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP aminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called adenosine triphosphate deaminase .
