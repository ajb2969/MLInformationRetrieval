   Mean arterial pressure      Mean arterial pressure   The mean arterial pressure ( MAP ) is a term used in medicine to describe an average blood pressure in an individual. 1 It is defined as the average arterial pressure during a single cardiac cycle .  Calculation  Total Peripheral Resistance (TPR) is represented mathematically by the formula:  R = ΔP/Q 2  R is TPR. ΔP is the change in pressure across the systemic circulation from its beginning to its end. Q is the flow through the vasculature (equal to cardiac output)  In other words:  Total Peripheral Resistance = (Mean Arterial Pressure - Mean Venous Pressure) / Cardiac Output  Therefore, Mean arterial pressure can be determined from: 3       M  A  P   =    (     C  O   ⋅  S   V  R   )   +   C  V  P          M  A  P        normal-⋅    C  O   S   V  R     C  V  P      MAP=(CO\cdot SVR)+CVP   where:       C  O      C  O    CO   is cardiac output      S  V  R      S  V  R    SVR   is systemic vascular resistance      C  V  P      C  V  P    CVP   is central venous pressure and usually small enough to be neglected in this formula.   Estimation  At normal resting heart rates    M  A  P      M  A  P    MAP   can be approximated using the more easily measured systolic and diastolic pressures ,    S  P      S  P    SP   and    D  P      D  P    DP   : 4 5 6       M  A  P   ≃    D  P   +    1  3    (    S  P   -   D  P    )        similar-to-or-equals    M  A  P       D  P       1  3       S  P     D  P        MAP\simeq DP+\frac{1}{3}(SP-DP)   or equivalently       M  A  P   ≃     2  3    (   D  P   )    +    1  3    (   S  P   )        similar-to-or-equals    M  A  P         2  3     D  P        1  3     S  P       MAP\simeq\frac{2}{3}(DP)+\frac{1}{3}(SP)     or equivalently       M  A  P   ≃     (    2  ×  D   P   )   +   S  P    3      similar-to-or-equals    M  A  P           2  D   P     S  P    3     MAP\simeq\frac{(2\times DP)+SP}{3}   or equivalently       M  A  P   ≃    D  P   +    1  3   P  P       similar-to-or-equals    M  A  P       D  P       1  3   P  P      MAP\simeq DP+\frac{1}{3}PP   where    P  P      P  P    PP   is the pulse pressure ,     S  P   -   D  P         S  P     D  P     SP-DP     At high heart rates    M  A  P      M  A  P    MAP   is more closely approximated by the arithmetic mean of systolic and diastolic pressures because of the change in shape of the arterial pressure pulse.  Clinical significance      M  A  P      M  A  P    MAP   is considered to be the perfusion pressure seen by organs in the body.  It is believed that a    M  A  P      M  A  P    MAP   that is greater than 60 mmHg is enough to sustain the organs of the average person.    M  A  P      M  A  P    MAP   is normally between 70 and 110 mmHg . 7 MAP may be used similarly to Systolic blood pressure in for target blood pressure. Both have been shown advantageous targets for sepsis, trauma, stroke, intracranial bleed, and hypertensive emergencies. 8  If the    M  A  P      M  A  P    MAP   falls below this number for an appreciable time, vital organs will not get enough Oxygen perfusion, and will become hypoxic , a condition called ischemia .
