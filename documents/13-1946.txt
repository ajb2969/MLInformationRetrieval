   Cycle decomposition (graph theory)      Cycle decomposition (graph theory)   In graph theory , a cycle decomposition is a decomposition (a partitioning of a graph's edges) into cycles . Every vertex in a graph that has a cycle decomposition must have even degree.  Cycle decomposition of    K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   and     K  n   -  I       subscript  K  n   I    K_{n}-I     Brian Alspach and Heather Gavlas established necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a decomposition of a complete graph of even order minus a 1-factor into even cycles and a complete graph of odd order into odd cycles. 1 Their proof relies on Cayley graphs , in particular, circulant graphs , and many of their decompositions come from the action of a permutation on a fixed subgraph.  They proved that for positive even integers   m   m   m   and   n   n   n   with    4  ≤  m  ≤  n        4  m       n     4\leq m\leq n   ,the graph     K  n   -  I       subscript  K  n   I    K_{n}-I   (where   I   I   I   is a 1-factor) can be decomposed into cycles of length   m   m   m   if and only if the number of edges in     K  n   -  I       subscript  K  n   I    K_{n}-I   is a multiple of   m   m   m   . Also, for positive odd integers   m   m   m   and   n   n   n   with 3≤m≤n, the graph    K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   can be decomposed into cycles of length   m   m   m   if and only if the number of edges in    K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   is a multiple of   m   m   m   .
