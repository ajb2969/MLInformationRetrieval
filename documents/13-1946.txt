Cycle decomposition (graph theory)

In graph theory, a cycle decomposition is a decomposition (a partitioning of a graph's edges) into cycles. Every vertex in a graph that has a cycle decomposition must have even degree.

Brian Alspach and Heather Gavlas established necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of a decomposition of a complete graph of even order minus a 1-factor into even cycles and a complete graph of odd order into odd cycles.1 Their proof relies on Cayley graphs, in particular, circulant graphs, and many of their decompositions come from the action of a permutation on a fixed subgraph.
They proved that for positive even integers

 ,the graph 
 
 
 
  (where 
 
 
 
  is a 1-factor) can be decomposed into cycles of length 
 
 
 
  if and only if the number of edges in 
 
 
 
  is a multiple of 
 
 
 
 . Also, for positive odd integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with 3≤m≤n, the graph 
 
 
 
  can be decomposed into cycles of length 
 
 
 
  if and only if the number of edges in 
 
 
 
  is a multiple of
