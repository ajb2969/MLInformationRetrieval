   Counter automaton      Counter automaton   In computer science , a counter automaton is a Pushdown automaton with only two symbols, A and the initial symbol in    Γ    normal-Γ   \Gamma\,   (the finite set of stack symbols). This class of automata can recognize a subset of Context free languages, for instance the language:      {    a  n    b  n    :   n  ∈  ℕ   }     conditional-set     superscript  a  n    superscript  b  n      n  ℕ     \{\ a^{n}b^{n}:n\in\mathbb{N}\}     To accept the above language, let x be a word on the form above. The automaton can use the symbol A to count the number of a 's in x (writing an A for each a in x ) and deleting an A for each b in x .  "  Category:Automata theory  Category:Models of computation
