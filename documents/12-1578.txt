Counter automaton

In computer science, a counter automaton is a Pushdown automaton with only two symbols, A and the initial symbol in 
 
 
 
  (the finite set of stack symbols). This class of automata can recognize a subset of Context free languages, for instance the language:



To accept the above language, let x be a word on the form above. The automaton can use the symbol A to count the number of a's in x (writing an A for each a in x) and deleting an A for each b in x.
