Abel–Plana formula

In mathematics, the Abel–Plana formula is a summation formula discovered independently by  and . It states that



It holds for functions f that are holomorphic in the region Re(z) ≥ 0, and satisfy a suitable growth condition in this region; for example it is enough to assume that |f| is bounded by C/|z|1+ε in this region for some constants C, ε > 0, though the formula also holds under much weaker bounds. .
An example is provided by the Hurwitz zeta function,



Abel also gave the following variation for alternating sums:
