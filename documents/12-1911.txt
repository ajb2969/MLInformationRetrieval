Markov kernel

In probability theory, a Markov kernel (or stochastic kernel) is a map that plays the role, in the general theory of Markov processes, that the transition matrix does in the theory of Markov processes with a finite state space.12
Formal definition
Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be measurable spaces. A Markov kernel with source 
 
 
 
  and target 
 
 
 
  is a map 
 
 
 
  with the following properties:

The map 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  - measureable for every 
 
 
 
 .
The map 
 
 
 
  is a probability measure on 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 .

(i.e. It associates to each point 
 
 
 
  a probability measure

 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that, for every measurable set 
 
 
 
 , the map 
 
 
 
  is measurable with respect to the 
 
 
 
 -algebra 
 
 
 
 .)
Examples

Simple random walk: Take 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then the Markov kernel 
 
 
 
  with



 
 , describes the transition rule for the random walk on 
 
 
 
 . Where 
 
 
 
  is the indicator function.

Galton-Watson process: Take 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , then



 
  with i.i.d. random variables

 
 .

General Markov processes with finite state space: Take 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then the transition rule can be represented as a stochastic matrix

 
  with 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 . In the convention of Markov kernels we write

Properties
Semidirect product
Let 
 
 
 
  be a probability space and 
 
 
 
  a Markov kernel from 
 
 
 
  to some 
 
 
 
 . Then there exists a unique measure 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , s.t.


 
 .
Regular conditional distribution
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Borel space, 
 
 
 
  a 
 
 
 
  - valued random variable on the measure space 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  a sub-
 
 
 
 -algebra. Then there exists a Markov kernel 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , s.t. 
 
 
 
  is a version of the conditional expectation

 
  for every 
 
 
 
 , i.e.


 
 .
It is called regular conditional distribution of 
 
 
 
  given 
 
 
 
  and is not uniquely defined.
