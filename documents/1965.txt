   Abstract elementary class      Abstract elementary class   In model theory , a discipline within mathematical logic , an abstract elementary class , or AEC for short, is a class of models with a partial order similar to the relation of an elementary substructure of an elementary class in first-order model theory. They were introduced by Saharon Shelah . 1  Definition      ⟨  K  ,   ≺  K   ⟩     K   subscript  precedes  K     \langle K,\prec_{K}\rangle   , for   K   K   K   a class of structures in some language    L  =   L   (  K  )        L    L  K     L=L(K)   , is an AEC if it has the following properties:       ≺  K     subscript  precedes  K    \prec_{K}   is a partial order on   K   K   K   .  If    M   ≺  K   N      subscript  precedes  K   M  N    M\prec_{K}N   then   M   M   M   is a substructure of   N   N   N   .  Isomorphisms    K   K   K   is closed under isomorphisms , and if      M  ,  N  ,   M  ′   ,   N  ′    ∈  K   ,       M  N   superscript  M  normal-′    superscript  N  normal-′    K    M,N,M^{\prime},N^{\prime}\in K,        f  :   M  ≃   M  ′     ,     normal-:  f   similar-to-or-equals  M   superscript  M  normal-′      f\colon M\simeq M^{\prime},        g  :   N  ≃   N  ′     ,     normal-:  g   similar-to-or-equals  N   superscript  N  normal-′      g\colon N\simeq N^{\prime},        f  ⊆  g   ,      f  g    f\subseteq g,   and     M   ≺  K   N   ,      subscript  precedes  K   M  N    M\prec_{K}N,   then      M  ′    ≺  K    N  ′    .      subscript  precedes  K    superscript  M  normal-′    superscript  N  normal-′     M^{\prime}\prec_{K}N^{\prime}.     Coherence : If      M  1    ≺  K    M  3    ,      subscript  precedes  K    subscript  M  1    subscript  M  3     M_{1}\prec_{K}M_{3},         M  2    ≺  K    M  3    ,      subscript  precedes  K    subscript  M  2    subscript  M  3     M_{2}\prec_{K}M_{3},   and      M  1   ⊆   M  2    ,       subscript  M  1    subscript  M  2     M_{1}\subseteq M_{2},   then      M  1    ≺  K    M  2    .      subscript  precedes  K    subscript  M  1    subscript  M  2     M_{1}\prec_{K}M_{2}.     Tarski–Vaught chain axioms : If   γ   γ   \gamma   is an ordinal and     {   M  α   ∣   α  <   γ    }   ⊆  K       conditional-set   subscript  M  α     α  γ    K    \{\,M_{\alpha}\mid\alpha<\gamma\,\}\subseteq K   is a chain (i.e.    α  <  β  <  γ  ⟹   M  α    ≺  K    M  β         α  β       γ        subscript  M  α      subscript  precedes  K      subscript  M  β      \alpha<\beta<\gamma\implies M_{\alpha}\prec_{K}M_{\beta}   ), then:        ⋃   α  <  γ     M  α    ∈  K        subscript     α  γ     subscript  M  α    K    \bigcup_{\alpha<\gamma}M_{\alpha}\in K     If     M  α    ≺  K   N      subscript  precedes  K    subscript  M  α   N    M_{\alpha}\prec_{K}N   , for all    α  <  γ      α  γ    \alpha<\gamma   , then      ⋃   α  <  γ     M  α     ≺  K   N      subscript  precedes  K     subscript     α  γ     subscript  M  α    N    \bigcup_{\alpha<\gamma}M_{\alpha}\prec_{K}N      Löwenheim–Skolem axiom : There exists a cardinal     μ  ≥    |   L   (  K  )    |   +   ℵ  0        μ        L  K     subscript  normal-ℵ  0      \mu\geq|L(K)|+\aleph_{0}   , such that if   A   A   A   is a subset of the universe of   M   M   M   , then there is   N   N   N   in   K   K   K   whose universe contains   A   A   A   such that     ∥  N  ∥   ≤    |  A  |   +  μ        norm  N       A   μ     \|N\|\leq|A|+\mu   and    N   ≺  K   M      subscript  precedes  K   N  M    N\prec_{K}M   . We let    LS   (  K  )      LS  K    \operatorname{LS}(K)   denote the least such   μ   μ   \mu   and call it the Löwenheim–Skolem number of   K   K   K   .   Note that we usually do not care about the models of size less than the Löwenheim–Skolem number and often assume that there are none (we will adopt this convention in this article). This is justified since we can always remove all such models from an AEC without influencing its structure above the Löwenheim–Skolem number.  A   K   K   K   -embedding is a map    f  :   M  →  N      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  N     f:M\rightarrow N   for     M  ,  N   ∈  K       M  N   K    M,N\in K   such that     f   [  M  ]     ≺  K   N      subscript  precedes  K     f   delimited-[]  M    N    f[M]\prec_{K}N   and   f   f   f   is an isomorphism from   M   M   M   onto    f   [  M  ]       f   delimited-[]  M     f[M]   . If   K   K   K   is clear from context, we omit it.  Examples  The following are examples of abstract elementary classes: 2   An Elementary class is the most basic example of an AEC: If T is a first-order theory, then the class    Mod   (  T  )      Mod  T    \operatorname{Mod}(T)   of models of T together with elementary substructure forms an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number |T| .  If   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a sentence in the infinitary logic     L    ω  1   ,  ω      subscript  L    subscript  ω  1   ω     L_{\omega_{1},\omega}   , and   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is a countable fragment containing   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , then    ⟨   Mod   (  T  )    ,   ≺  ℱ   ⟩      Mod  T    subscript  precedes  ℱ     \langle\operatorname{Mod}(T),\prec_{\mathcal{F}}\rangle   is an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   . This can be generalized to other logics, like    L   κ  ,  ω      subscript  L   κ  ω     L_{\kappa,\omega}   , or     L    ω  1   ,  ω     (  Q  )        subscript  L    subscript  ω  1   ω    Q    L_{\omega_{1},\omega}(Q)   , where   Q   Q   Q   expresses "there exists uncountably many".  If T is a first-order countable superstable theory, the set of    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   -saturated models of T , together with elementary substructure, is an AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number    2   ℵ  0      superscript  2   subscript  normal-ℵ  0     2^{\aleph_{0}}   .  Zilber's pseudo-exponential fields form an AEC.   Common assumptions  AECs are very general objects and one usually make some of the assumptions below when studying them:   An AEC has joint embedding if any two model can be embedded inside a common model.  An AEC has no maximal model if any model has a proper extension.  An AEC   K   K   K   has amalgamation if for any triple      M  0   ,   M  1   ,   M  2    ∈  K        subscript  M  0    subscript  M  1    subscript  M  2    K    M_{0},M_{1},M_{2}\in K   with     M  0    ≺  K    M  1       subscript  precedes  K    subscript  M  0    subscript  M  1     M_{0}\prec_{K}M_{1}   ,     M  0    ≺  K    M  2       subscript  precedes  K    subscript  M  0    subscript  M  2     M_{0}\prec_{K}M_{2}   , there is    N  ∈  K      N  K    N\in K   and embeddings of    M  1     subscript  M  1    M_{1}   and    M  2     subscript  M  2    M_{2}   inside   N   N   N   that fix    M  0     subscript  M  0    M_{0}   pointwise.   Note that in elementary classes, joint embedding holds whenever the theory is complete , while amalgamation and no maximal models are well-known consequences of the compactness theorem . These three assumptions allow us to build a universal model-homogeneous monster model   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   , exactly as in the elementary case.  Another assumption that one can make is tameness .  Shelah's categoricity conjecture  Shelah introduced AECs to provide a uniform framework in which to generalize first-order classification theory . Classification theory started with Morley's categoricity theorem , so it is natural to ask whether a similar result holds in AECs. This is Shelah's categoricity conjecture . It states that there should be a Hanf number for categoricity:  For every AEC K there should be a cardinal   μ   μ   \mu   depending only on    LS   (  K  )      LS  K    \operatorname{LS}(K)   such that if K is categorical in some     λ  ≥  μ      λ  μ    \lambda\geq\mu   (i.e. K has exactly one (up to isomorphism) model of size   λ   λ   \lambda   ), then K is categorical in   θ   θ   \theta   for all     θ  ≥  μ      θ  μ    \theta\geq\mu   .  Several approximations have been published (see for example the results section below), assuming set-theoretic assumptions (such as the existence of large cardinals or variations of the generalized continuum hypothesis ), or model-theoretic assumptions (such as amalgamation or tameness). As of 2014, the original conjecture remains open.  Results  The following are some important results about AECs. Except for the last, all results are due to Shelah.   Shelah's Presentation Theorem : 3 Any AEC   K   K   K   is    PC   2   LS   (  K  )        subscript  PC   superscript  2   LS  K      \operatorname{PC}_{2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}}   : it is a reduct of a class of models of a first-order theory omitting at most    2   LS   (  K  )       superscript  2   LS  K     2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)}    types .  Hanf number for existence : 4 Any AEC   K   K   K   which has a model of size    ℶ    (   2   LS   (  K  )     )   +      subscript  normal-ℶ   superscript   superscript  2   LS  K        \beth_{(2^{\operatorname{LS}(K)})^{+}}   has models of arbitrarily large sizes.  Amalgamation from categoricity : 5 If K is an AEC categorical in   λ   λ   \lambda   and    λ  +     superscript  λ     \lambda^{+}   and     2  λ   <   2   λ  +         superscript  2  λ    superscript  2   superscript  λ       2^{\lambda}<2^{\lambda^{+}}   , then K has amalgamation for models of size   λ   λ   \lambda   .  Existence from categoricity : 6 If K is a    PC   ℵ  0      subscript  PC   subscript  normal-ℵ  0     \operatorname{PC}_{\aleph_{0}}   AEC with Löwenheim–Skolem number    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   and K is categorical in    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   and    ℵ  1     subscript  normal-ℵ  1    \aleph_{1}   , then K has a model of size    ℵ  2     subscript  normal-ℵ  2    \aleph_{2}   . In particular, no sentence of     L    ω  1   ,  ω     (  Q  )        subscript  L    subscript  ω  1   ω    Q    L_{\omega_{1},\omega}(Q)   can have exactly one uncountable model.  Approximations to Shelah's categoricity conjecture :  Downward transfer from a successor : 7 If K is an abstract elementary class with amalgamation that is categorical in a "high-enough" successor    λ   λ   \lambda   , then K is categorical in all high-enough    μ  ≤  λ      μ  λ    \mu\leq\lambda   .  Shelah's categoricity conjecture for a successor from large cardinals : 8 If there are class-many strongly compact cardinals , then Shelah's categoricity conjecture holds when we start with categoricity at a successor.
