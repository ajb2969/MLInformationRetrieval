   Covariance operator      Covariance operator   In probability theory , for a probability measure  P on a Hilbert space  H with inner product     ⟨  ⋅  ,  ⋅  ⟩     normal-⋅  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle   , the covariance of P is the bilinear form Cov: H × H → R given by       Cov   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ∫  H     ⟨  x  ,  z  ⟩    ⟨  y  ,  z  ⟩   d  𝐏   (  z  )           Cov   x  y      subscript   H      x  z    y  z   normal-d  𝐏  z      \mathrm{Cov}(x,y)=\int_{H}\langle x,z\rangle\langle y,z\rangle\,\mathrm{d}%
 \mathbf{P}(z)     for all x and y in H . The covariance operator  C is then defined by       Cov   (  x  ,  y  )    =   ⟨   C  x   ,  y  ⟩         Cov   x  y       C  x   y     \mathrm{Cov}(x,y)=\langle Cx,y\rangle     (from the Riesz representation theorem , such operator exists if Cov is bounded ). Since Cov is symmetric in its arguments, the covariance operator is self-adjoint (the infinite-dimensional analogy of the transposition symmetry in the finite-dimensional case). When P is a centred Gaussian measure , C is also a nuclear operator . In particular, it is a compact operator of trace class , that is, it has finite trace .  Even more generally, for a probability measure  P on a Banach space  B , the covariance of P is the bilinear form on the algebraic dual  B # , defined by       Cov   (  x  ,  y  )    =    ∫  B     ⟨  x  ,  z  ⟩    ⟨  y  ,  z  ⟩   d  𝐏   (  z  )           Cov   x  y      subscript   B      x  z    y  z   normal-d  𝐏  z      \mathrm{Cov}(x,y)=\int_{B}\langle x,z\rangle\langle y,z\rangle\,\mathrm{d}%
 \mathbf{P}(z)     where    ⟨  x  ,  z  ⟩     x  z    \langle x,z\rangle   is now the value of the linear functional x on the element z .  Quite similarly, the covariance function of a function-valued random element (in special cases called random process or random field ) z is       Cov   (  x  ,  y  )    =   ∫   z   (  x  )   z   (  y  )   d  𝐏   (  z  )     =   E   (   z   (  x  )   z   (  y  )    )            Cov   x  y        z  x  z  y  normal-d  𝐏  z           E    z  x  z  y       \mathrm{Cov}(x,y)=\int z(x)z(y)\,\mathrm{d}\mathbf{P}(z)=E(z(x)z(y))     where z ( x ) is now the value of the function z at the point x , i.e., the value of the linear functional     u  ↦   u   (  x  )       maps-to  u    u  x     u\mapsto u(x)   evaluated at z .
