   Torsion constant      Torsion constant   The torsion constant is a geometrical property of a bar's cross-section which is involved in the relationship between angle of twist and applied torque along the axis of the bar, for a homogeneous linear-elastic bar. The torsion constant, together with material properties and length, describes a bar's torsional stiffness . The SI unit for torsion constant is m 4 .  History  In 1820, the French engineer A. Duleau derived analytically that the torsion constant of a beam is identical to the second moment of area normal to the section J zz , which has an exact analytic equation, by assuming that a plane section before twisting remains plane after twisting, and a diameter remains a straight line. Unfortunately, that assumption is correct only in beams with circular cross-sections, and is incorrect for any other shape where warping takes place. 1  For non-circular cross-sections, there are no exact analytical equations for finding the torsion constant. However approximate solutions have been found for many shapes. Non-circular cross-section always have warping deformations that require numerical methods to allow the exact calculation of the torsion constant. 2  The torsional stiffness of a beams with non-circular cross sections is significantly increased if the warping of the end sections is restrained by, for example, stiff end blocks. 3  Partial Derivation  For a beam of uniform cross-section along its length:      θ  =    T  L    J  G        θ      T  L     J  G      \theta=\frac{TL}{JG}   where     θ   θ   \theta   is the angle of twist in radians   T is the applied torque  L is the beam length  J is the torsional constant  G is the Modulus of rigidity (shear modulus) of the material   (Figure)  TorsionConstantBar.svg   Examples for specific uniform cross-sectional shapes  Circle       J   z  z    =    J   x  x    +   J   y  y     =     π   r  4    4   +    π   r  4    4    =    π   r  4    2          subscript  J    z  z       subscript  J    x  x     subscript  J    y  y                π   superscript  r  4    4       π   superscript  r  4    4             π   superscript  r  4    2      J_{zz}=J_{xx}+J_{yy}=\frac{\pi r^{4}}{4}+\frac{\pi r^{4}}{4}=\frac{\pi r^{4}}{2}    4 where   r is the radius   This is identical to the second moment of area J zz and is exact.  alternatively write    J  =    π   D  4    32       J      π   superscript  D  4    32     J=\frac{\pi D^{4}}{32}    5 where   D is the Diameter   Ellipse      J  ≈    π   a  3    b  3      a  2   +   b  2         J      π   superscript  a  3    superscript  b  3       superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2       J\approx\frac{\pi a^{3}b^{3}}{a^{2}+b^{2}}    6 7 where   a is the major radius  b is the minor radius   Square      J  ≈   2.25   a  4        J    2.25   superscript  a  4      J\approx\,2.25a^{4}    8 where   a is half the side length   Rectangle      J  ≈   β  a   b  3        J    β  a   superscript  b  3      J\approx\beta ab^{3}   where   a is the length of the long side  b is the length of the short side     β   β   \beta   is found from the following table:       a/b      β   β   \beta          1.0   0.141     1.5   0.196     2.0   0.229     2.5   0.249     3.0   0.263     4.0   0.281     5.0   0.291     6.0   0.299     10.0   0.312        ∞     \infty      0.333     9  Alternatively the following equation can be used with an error of not greater than 4%:     J  ≈   a   b  3    (    1  3   -   0.21   b  a    (   1  -    b  4    12   a  4      )     )        J    a   superscript  b  3       1  3     0.21    b  a     1     superscript  b  4     12   superscript  a  4           J\approx ab^{3}\left(\frac{1}{3}-0.21\frac{b}{a}\left(1-\frac{b^{4}}{12a^{4}}%
