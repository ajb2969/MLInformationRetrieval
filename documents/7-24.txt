Amagat

An amagat is a practical unit of number density. Although it can be applied to any substance at any conditions, it is defined as the number of ideal gas molecules per unit volume at 1 atm (= 101.325 kPa) and 0 °C (= 273.15 K).1 It is named after Emile Amagat, who also has Amagat's law named after him. The abbreviated form of amagat is "amg."
Definition
Number density in amg, denoted here by 
 
 
 
 , is defined as


 
 ,
where n0 = 1 amg = 2.686 7805
 
 
 
  m−3 = 44.615 036 mol/m3 is the Loschmidt constant.
In practice, number density of an ideal gas at pressure P and temperature T can be calculated as2


 
 , where T0 = 273.15 K and p0 = 101.325 kPa.
Example
Number density of an ideal gas (such as air) at room temperature (20 °C) and 1 atm (101.325 kPa) is


 
 .
