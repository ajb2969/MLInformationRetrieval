   Amagat      Amagat   An amagat is a practical unit of number density . Although it can be applied to any substance at any conditions, it is defined as the number of ideal gas  molecules per unit volume at 1 atm (= 101.325 kPa ) and 0 °C (= 273.15 K). 1 It is named after Emile Amagat , who also has Amagat's law named after him. The abbreviated form of amagat is "amg."  Definition  Number density in amg, denoted here by   η   η   \eta   , is defined as      η  =   n   n  0        η    n   subscript  n  0      \eta=\frac{n}{n_{0}}   ,  where n 0 = 1 amg = 2.686 7805     ×    10  2   5       absent     superscript  10  2   5     \times 10^{2}5   m −3 = 44.615 036 mol/m 3 is the Loschmidt constant .  In practice, number density of an ideal gas at pressure P and temperature T can be calculated as 2      η  =    (   p   p  0    )    (    T  0   T   )   amg       η      p   subscript  p  0       subscript  T  0   T   amg     \eta=\left(\frac{p}{p_{0}}\right)\left(\frac{T_{0}}{T}\right)\,{\rm amg}   , where T 0 = 273.15 K and p 0 = 101.325 kPa .  Example  Number density of an ideal gas (such as air) at room temperature (20 °C ) and 1 atm (101.325 kPa) is      η  =    (     1   atm    p  0    )    (     273.15   K     (   273.15  +  20   )   K    )   amg   =    0.932   amg         η        1  atm    subscript  p  0        273.15  normal-K       273.15  20   normal-K    amg          0.932  amg      \eta=\left(\frac{1\,{\rm atm}}{p_{0}}\right)\left(\frac{273.15\,{\rm K}}{(273.%
 15+20)\,{\rm K}}\right){\rm amg}=0.932\,{\rm amg}   .  References  "  Category:Amount of substance  Category:Units of density  Category:Physical chemistry     ↩  In this formula, absolute units of pressure and temperature, relative to vacuum and absolute zero , must be used. ↩
