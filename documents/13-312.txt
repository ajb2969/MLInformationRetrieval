Invertible module

In mathematics, particularly commutative algebra, an invertible module is intuitively a module that has an inverse with respect to the tensor product. Invertible modules form the foundation for the definition of invertible sheaves in algebraic geometry.
Formally, a finitely generated module M over a ring R is said to be invertible if it is locally a free module of rank 1. In other words 
 
 
 
  for all primes P of R. Now, if M is an invertible R-module, then its dual  Hom(M,R)}} is its inverse with respect to the tensor product, i.e. 
 
 
 
 .
The theory of invertible modules is closely related to the theory of codimension one varieties including the theory of divisors.
