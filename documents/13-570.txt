   Mumford vanishing theorem      Mumford vanishing theorem   In algebraic geometry , the Mumford vanishing theorem states that if L is a semi-ample invertible sheaf with Iitaka dimension at least 2 on a complex projective manifold , then         H  i    (  X  ,   L   -  1    )    =   0  for  i   =  0   ,  1.     formulae-sequence         superscript  H  i    X   superscript  L    1        0  for  i        0    1.    H^{i}(X,L^{-1})=0\text{ for }i=0,1.     The Mumford vanishing theorem is related to the Ramanujam vanishing theorem , and is generalized by the Kawamataâ€“Viehweg vanishing theorem .
