Mumford vanishing theorem

In algebraic geometry, the Mumford vanishing theorem  states that if L is a semi-ample invertible sheaf with Iitaka dimension at least 2 on a complex projective manifold, then



The Mumford vanishing theorem is related to the Ramanujam vanishing theorem, and is generalized by the Kawamataâ€“Viehweg vanishing theorem.
