Arogenate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)

In enzymology, an arogenate dehydrogenase [NAD(P)+] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-arogenate + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  L-tyrosine + NAD(P)H + CO2


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-arogenate, NAD+, and NADP+, whereas its 4 products are L-tyrosine, NADH, NADPH, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arogenate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating). Other names in common use include arogenic dehydrogenase (ambiguous), cyclohexadienyl dehydrogenase, and pretyrosine dehydrogenase (ambiguous).
