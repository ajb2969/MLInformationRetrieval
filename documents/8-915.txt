   Gallium trichloride      Gallium trichloride   Gallium trichloride is the chemical compound with the formula GaCl 3 . Solid gallium trichloride exists as a dimer with the formula Ga 2 Cl 6 . 1 It is colourless and soluble in virtually all solvents, even alkanes, which is truly unusual for a metal halide. It is the main precursor to most derivatives of gallium and a reagent in organic synthesis . 2  As a Lewis acid , GaCl 3 is milder than aluminium trichloride . Gallium(III) is easier to reduce than Al(III), so the chemistry of reduced gallium compounds is more extensive than for aluminium. Ga 2 Cl 4 is known whereas the corresponding Al 2 Cl 4 is not. The coordination chemistry of Ga(III) and Fe(III) are similar, and gallium(III) compounds have been used as diamagnetic analogues of ferric compounds.  Preparation  Gallium trichloride can be prepared from the elements, heating gallium metal in a stream of chlorine , and purifying the product by sublimation under vacuum. 3 4   2 Ga + 3 Cl 2 → 2 GaCl 3    It can also be prepared from the gallium oxide by heating with thionyl chloride : 5   Ga 2 O 3 + 3 SOCl 2 → 2 GaCl 3 + 3 SO 2    Structure  The dimeric structure involving two chlorine bridging atoms with the gallium atoms essentially tetrahedrally coordinated by chlorine is surprising, as the chlorides of the two members of group 13 above and below gallium, AlCl 3 and InCl 3 both contain 6 coordinate metal atoms in a three-dimensional structure. As a consequence of its structure where there are no significant lattice forces, gallium trichloride has the lowest melting point of all of the aluminium, gallium and indium trihalides. The formula of Ga 2 Cl 6 is often written as Ga 2 (μ-Cl) 2 Cl 4 . In the gas phase the dimers dissociate to trigonal planar monomers.  Complexes  Gallium is the lightest member of Group 13 to have a full d shell, (gallium has the electronic configuration Ar 3 d 10 4 s 2 4 p 1) below the valence electrons that could take part in d -π bonding with ligands. The low oxidation state of Ga in Ga(III)Cl 3 , along with the low electronegativity and high polarisability , allow Ga(III)Cl 3 to behave as a "Soft Acid" in terms of the HSAB theory . The strength of the bonds between gallium halides and ligands have been extensively studied. What emerges is:   GaCl 3 is a weaker Lewis acid than AlCl 3 towards N and O donors e.g. pyridine  GaCl 3 is a stronger Lewis acid than AlCl 3 towards thioethers e.g. dimethyl sulfide , Me 2 S   With a chloride ion as ligand the tetrahedral GaCl 4 − ion is produced, the 6 coordinate GaCl 6 3− cannot be made. Compounds like KGa 2 Cl 7 that have a chloride bridged anion are known 6 In a molten mixture of KCl and GaCl 3 , the following equilibrium exists:   2 GaCl 4 −     ←  →     normal-→  normal-←    \overrightarrow{\leftarrow}   Ga 2 Cl 7 − + Cl −    Use in detection of solar neutrinos  110 tons of gallium trichloride aqueous solution was used in the GALLEX and GNO experiments performed at Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso in Italy to detect solar neutrinos . In these experiments, germanium -71 was produced by neutrino interactions with the isotope gallium-71 (which has a natural abundance of 40%), and the subsequent beta decays of germanium-71 were measured. 7  See also   Gallium halides   References        External links     "  Category:Inorganic compounds  Category:Gallium compounds  Category:Chlorides  Category:Metal halides     Wells, A.F.
