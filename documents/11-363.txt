   Nucleoside-triphosphatase      Nucleoside-triphosphatase   In enzymology , a nucleoside-triphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NTP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NDP + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are NTP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are NDP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is unspecific diphosphate phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include nucleoside triphosphate phosphohydrolase , nucleoside-5-triphosphate phosphohydrolase , and nucleoside 5-triphosphatase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and thiamine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
