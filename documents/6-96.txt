Riemann's differential equation

In mathematics, Riemann's differential equation, named after Bernhard Riemann, is a generalization of the hypergeometric differential equation, allowing the regular singular points to occur anywhere on the Riemann sphere, rather than merely at 0, 1, and ∞. The equation is also known as the Papperitz equation.1
The hypergeometric differential equation is a second-order linear differential equation which has three regular singular points, 0, 1 and 
 
 
 
 . That equation admits two linearly independent solutions; near a singularity 
 
 
 
 , the solutions take the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a local variable, and 
 
 
 
  is locally holomorphic with 
 
 
 
 . The real number 
 
 
 
  is called the exponent of the solution at 
 
 
 
 . Let α, β and γ be the exponents of one solution solution at 0, 1 and ∞ respectively; and let α', β' and γ' be that of the other. Then


 
  By applying suitable changes of variable, it is possible to transform the hypergeometric equation: Applying Möbius transformations will adjust the positions of the RSPs, while other transformations (see below) can change the exponents at the RSPs , subject to the exponents adding up to 1.
Definition
The differential equation is given by









\frac{\alpha\alpha' (a-b)(a-c)} {z-a} +\frac{\beta\beta' (b-c)(b-a)} {z-b} +\frac{\gamma\gamma' (c-a)(c-b)} {z-c} \right] \frac{w}{(z-a)(z-b)(z-c)}=0.
The regular singular points are 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . The exponents of the solutions at these RSPs are, respectively, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
 . As before, the exponents are subject to the condition



Solutions and relationship with the hypergeometric function
The solutions are denoted by the Riemann P-symbol (also known as the Papperitz symbol)



The standard hypergeometric function may be expressed as



The P-functions obey a number of identities; one of them allows a general P-function to be expressed in terms of the hypergeometric function. It is



In other words, one may write the solutions in terms of the hypergeometric function as



The full complement of Kummer's 24 solutions may be obtained in this way; see the article hypergeometric differential equation for a treatment of Kummer's solutions.
Fractional linear transformations
The P-function possesses a simple symmetry under the action of fractional linear transformations known as Möbius transformations (that are the conformal remappings of the Riemann sphere), or equivalently, under the action of the group 
 
 
 
 . Given arbitrary complex numbers
