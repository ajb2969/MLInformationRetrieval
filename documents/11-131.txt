Tubulin—tyrosine ligase




Tubulin—tyrosine ligase

In enzymology, a tubulin-tyrosine ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + detyrosinated alpha-tubulin + L-tyrosine 
 
 
 
  alpha-tubulin + ADP + phosphate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, detyrosinated alpha-tubulin, and L-tyrosine, whereas its 3 products are alpha-tubulin, ADP, and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is alpha-tubulin:L-tyrosine ligase (ADP-forming).
