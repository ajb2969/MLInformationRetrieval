   Local field      Local field   In mathematics , a local field is a special type of field that is a locally compact  topological field with respect to a non-discrete topology . 1 Given such a field, an absolute value can be defined on it. There are two basic types of local field: those in which the absolute value is archimedean and those in which it is not. In the first case, one calls the local field an archimedean local field , in the second case, one calls it a non-archimedean local field . Local fields arise naturally in number theory as completions of global fields .  Every local field is isomorphic (as a topological field) to one of the following:   Archimedean local fields ( characteristic zero): the real numbers  R , and the complex numbers  C .  Non-archimedean local fields of characteristic zero: finite extensions of the p -adic numbers  Q p (where p is any prime number ).  Non-archimedean local fields of characteristic p (for p any given prime number): the field of formal Laurent series  F q (( T )) over a finite field  F q (where q is a power of p ).   There is an equivalent definition of non-archimedean local field: it is a field that is complete with respect to a discrete valuation and whose residue field is finite. However, some authors consider a more general notion, requiring only that the residue field be perfect , not necessarily finite. 2 This article uses the former definition.  Induced absolute value  Given a locally compact topological field K , an absolute value can be defined as follows. First, consider the additive group of the field. As a locally compact topological group , it has a unique (up to positive scalar multiple) Haar measure μ. The absolute value is defined so as to measure the change in size of a set after multiplying it by an element of K . Specifically, define |·| : K → R by 3       |  a  |   :=    μ   (   a  X   )     μ   (  X  )        assign    a       μ    a  X      μ  X      |a|:=\frac{\mu(aX)}{\mu(X)}   for any measurable subset X of K (with 0 Corollary 1, page 5 of  Explicitly, for a positive real number m , define the subset B m of K by        B  m   :=   {   a  ∈  K   :    |  a  |   ≤  m   }    .     assign   subscript  B  m    conditional-set    a  K       a   m      B_{m}:=\{a\in K:|a|\leq m\}.   Then, the B m make up a neighbourhood basis of 0 in K .  Non-archimedean local field theory  For a non-archimedean local field F (with absolute value denoted by |·|), the following objects are important:   its ring of integers     𝒪  =   {   a  ∈  F   :    |  a  |   ≤  1   }       𝒪   conditional-set    a  F       a   1      \mathcal{O}=\{a\in F:|a|\leq 1\}   which is a discrete valuation ring , is the closed unit ball of F , and is compact ;  the units in its ring of integers     𝒪  ×   =   {   a  ∈  F   :    |  a  |   =  1   }        superscript  𝒪     conditional-set    a  F       a   1      \mathcal{O}^{\times}=\{a\in F:|a|=1\}   which forms a group and is the unit sphere of F ;  the unique non-zero prime ideal    𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   in its ring of integers which is its open unit ball    {   a  ∈  F   :    |  a  |   <  1   }     conditional-set    a  F       a   1     \{a\in F:|a|<1\}   ;  a generator ϖ of   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   called a uniformizer of F ;  its residue field    k  =   𝒪  /  𝔪       k    𝒪  𝔪     k=\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{m}   which is finite (since it is compact and discrete ).   Every non-zero element a of F can be written as a = ϖ n u with u a unit, and n a unique integer. The normalized valuation of F is the surjective function  v : F → Z ∪ {∞} defined by sending a non-zero a to the unique integer n such that a = ϖ n u with u a unit, and by sending 0 to ∞. If q is the cardinality of the residue field, the absolute value on F induced by its structure as a local field is given by 4        |  a  |   =   q   -   v   (  a  )       .        a    superscript  q      v  a       |a|=q^{-v(a)}.     An equivalent definition of a non-archimedean local field is that it is a field that is complete with respect to a discrete valuation and whose residue field is finite.  Examples   The p -adic numbers : the ring of integers of Q p is the ring of p -adic integers Z p . Its prime ideal is p Z p and its residue field is Z / p Z . Every non-zero element of Q p can be written as u  p n where u is a unit in Z p and n is an integer, then v ( u  p n ) = n for the normalized valuation.  The formal Laurent series over a finite field : the ring of integers of F q (( T )) is the ring of formal power series  F q [[ T ]]. Its prime ideal is ( T ) (i.e. the power series whose constant term is zero) and its residue field is F q . Its normalized valuation is related to the (lower) degree of a formal Laurent series as follows:        v   (    ∑   i  =   -  m    ∞     a  i    T  i     )    =   -  m         v    superscript   subscript     i    m          subscript  a  i    superscript  T  i        m     v\left(\sum_{i=-m}^{\infty}a_{i}T^{i}\right)=-m   (where a − m is non-zero).     The formal Laurent series over the complex numbers is not a local field. For example, its residue field is C [[ T ]]/( T ) = C , which is not finite.   Higher unit groups  The n th higher unit group of a non-archimedean local field F is       U   (  n  )    =   1  +   𝔪  n    =   {   u  ∈   𝒪  ×    :   u  ≡    1    (    mod    𝔪  n    )     }          superscript  U  n     1   superscript  𝔪  n          conditional-set    u   superscript  𝒪       u    1    mod   superscript  𝔪  n          U^{(n)}=1+\mathfrak{m}^{n}=\left\{u\in\mathcal{O}^{\times}:u\equiv 1\,(\mathrm%
 {mod}\,\mathfrak{m}^{n})\right\}   for n ≥ 1. The group U (1) is called the group of principal units , and any element of it is called a principal unit . The full unit group    𝒪  ×     superscript  𝒪     \mathcal{O}^{\times}   is denoted U (0) .  The higher unit groups provide a decreasing filtration of the unit group       𝒪  ×   ⊇   U   (  1  )    ⊇   U   (  2  )    ⊇  ⋯       superset-of-or-equals   superscript  𝒪     superscript  U  1     superset-of-or-equals     superscript  U  2     superset-of-or-equals    normal-⋯     \mathcal{O}^{\times}\supseteq U^{(1)}\supseteq U^{(2)}\supseteq\cdots   whose quotients are given by        𝒪  ×   /   U   (  n  )     ≅      (   𝒪  /   𝔪  n    )   ×    and    U   (  n  )     /   U   (   n  +  1   )     ≈   𝒪  /  𝔪            superscript  𝒪     superscript  U  n         superscript    𝒪   superscript  𝔪  n      and   superscript  U  n     superscript  U    n  1            𝒪  𝔪      \mathcal{O}^{\times}/U^{(n)}\cong\left(\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{m}^{n}\right)^{%
 \times}\text{ and }\,U^{(n)}/U^{(n+1)}\approx\mathcal{O}/\mathfrak{m}   for n ≥ 1. 5 (Here "   ≈     \approx   " means a non-canonical isomorphism.)  Structure of the unit group  The multiplicative group of non-zero elements of a non-archimedean local field F is isomorphic to       F  ×   ≅    (  ϖ  )   ×   μ   q  -  1    ×   U   (  1  )          superscript  F      ϖ   subscript  μ    q  1     superscript  U  1      F^{\times}\cong(\varpi)\times\mu_{q-1}\times U^{(1)}   where q is the order of the residue field, and μ q −1 is the group of ( q −1)st roots of unity (in F ). Its structure as an abelian group depends on its characteristic :   If F has positive characteristic p , then          F  ×   ≅   𝐙  ⊕   𝐙  /   (   q  -  1   )    ⊕   𝐙  p  𝐍         superscript  F     direct-sum  𝐙    𝐙    q  1     superscript   subscript  𝐙  p   𝐍      F^{\times}\cong\mathbf{Z}\oplus\mathbf{Z}/{(q-1)}\oplus\mathbf{Z}_{p}^{\mathbf%
 {N}}       where N denotes the natural numbers ;    If F has characteristic zero (i.e. it is a finite extension of Q p of degree d ), then          F  ×   ≅   𝐙  ⊕   𝐙  /   (   q  -  1   )    ⊕   𝐙  /   p  a    ⊕   𝐙  p  d         superscript  F     direct-sum  𝐙    𝐙    q  1      𝐙   superscript  p  a     superscript   subscript  𝐙  p   d      F^{\times}\cong\mathbf{Z}\oplus\mathbf{Z}/(q-1)\oplus\mathbf{Z}/p^{a}\oplus%
 \mathbf{Z}_{p}^{d}       where a ≥ 0 is defined so that the group of p -power roots of unity in F is    μ   p  a      subscript  μ   superscript  p  a     \mu_{p^{a}}   . 6    Higher-dimensional local fields  It is natural to introduce non-archimedean local fields in a uniform geometric way as the field of fractions of the completion of the local ring of a one-dimensional arithmetic scheme of rank 1 at its non-singular point. For generalizations, a local field is sometimes called a one-dimensional local field .  For a non-negative integer  n , an n -dimensional local field is a complete discrete valuation field whose residue field is an ( n − 1)-dimensional local field. 7 Depending on the definition of local field, a zero-dimensional local field is then either a finite field (with the definition used in this article), or a quasi-finite field , 8 or a perfect field.  From the geometric point of view, n -dimensional local fields with last finite residue field are naturally associated to a complete flag of subschemes of an n -dimensional arithmetic scheme.
