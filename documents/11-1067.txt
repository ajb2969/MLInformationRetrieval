Aromatic-amino-acid—glyoxylate transaminase

In enzymology, an aromatic-amino-acid-glyoxylate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

an aromatic amino acid + glyoxylate 
 
 
 
  an aromatic oxo acid + glycine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are aromatic amino acid and glyoxylate, whereas its two products are aromatic oxo acid and glycine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aromatic-amino-acid:glyoxylate aminotransferase.
