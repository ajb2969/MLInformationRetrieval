Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra
'''Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebras''' ('''LM''n'' algebras''') were introduced in the 1940s by [[Grigore Moisil]] (initially under the name of '''Łukasiewicz algebras'''Andrei Popescu, ''[http://www.jstor.org/stable/20016741 Łukasiewicz-Moisil Relation Algebras]'', Studia Logica, Vol. 81, No. 2 (Nov., 2005), pp. 167-189) in the hope of giving [[Algebraic semantics (mathematical logic)|algebraic semantics]] for the ''n''-valued [[Łukasiewicz logic]]. However, in 1956 Alan Rose discovered that for ''n'' ≥ 5, the Łukasiewicz–Moisil algebra does not [[model (mathematical logic)|model]] the Łukasiewicz logic. A faithful model for the ℵ0-valued (infinitely-many-valued) [[Łukasiewicz–Tarski logic]] was provided by [[C. C. Chang]]'s [[MV-algebra]], introduced in 1958. For the axiomatically more complicated (finite) ''n''-valued Łukasiewicz logics, suitable algebras were 
 published in 1977 by Revaz Grigolia and called MVn-algebras.1 MVn-algebras are a subclass of LMn-algebras, and the inclusion is strict for n ≥ 5.2 In 1982 Roberto Cignoli published some additional constraints that added to LMn-algebras produce proper models for n-valued Łukasiewicz logic; Cignoli called his discovery proper Łukasiewicz algebras.3
Moisil however published in 1964 a logic to match his algebra (in the general n ≥ 5 case), now called Moisil logic.4 After coming in contact with Zadeh's fuzzy logic, in 1968 Moisil also introduced an infinitely-many-valued logic variant and its corresponding LMθ algebras.5 Although the Łukasiewicz implication cannot be defined in a LMn algebra for n ≥ 5, the Heyting implication can be, i.e. LMn algebras are Heyting algebras; as a result, Moisil logics can also be developed (from a purely logical standpoint) in the framework of Brower’s intuitionistic logic.6
Definition
A LMn algebra is a De Morgan algebra (a notion also introduced by Moisil) with n-1 additional unary, "modal" operations
 
 
 
 , i.e. an algebra of signature

 
  where J = { 1, 2, ... n-1 }. (Some sources denote the additional operators as 
 
 
 
  to emphasize that they depend on the order n of the algebra.7) The additional unary operators ∇j must satisfy the following axioms for all x, y ∈ A and j, k ∈ J:8
















if 
 
 
 
  for all j ∈ J, then x = y.

(The adjective "modal" is related to the [ultimately failed] program of Tarksi and Łukasiewicz to axiomatize modal logic using many-valued logic.)
Elementary properties
The duals of some of the above axioms follow as properties:9








Additionally
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .10 In other words, the unary "modal" operations 
 
 
 
  are lattice endomorphisms.11
Examples
LM2 algebras are the Boolean algebras. The canonical Łukasiewicz algebra 
 
 
 
  that Moisil had in mind were over the set L_n = } with negation 
 
 
 
  conjunction 
 
 
 
  and disjunction 
 
 
 
  and the unary "modal" operators:



If B is a Boolean algebra, then the algebra over the set B[2] ≝ {(x, y) ∈ B×B | x ≤ y} with the lattice operations defined pointwise and with ¬(x, y) ≝ (¬y, ¬x), and with the unary "modal" operators ∇2(x, y) ≝ (y, y) and ∇1(x, y) = ¬∇2¬(x, y) = (x, x) [derived by axiom 4] is a three-valued Łukasiewicz algebra.12
Representation
Moisil proved that every LMn algebra can be embedded in a direct product (of copies) of the canonical 
 
 
 
  algebra. As a corollary, every LMn algebra is a subdirect product of subalgebras of 
 
 
 
 .13
The Heyting implication can be defined as:14



Antonio Monteiro showed that for every monadic Boolean algebra one can construct a trivalent Łukasiewicz algebra (by taking certain equivalence classes) and that any trivalent Łukasiewicz algebra is isomorphic to a Łukasiewicz algebra thus derived from a monadic Boolean algebra.1516 Cignoli summarizes the importance of this result as: "Since it was shown by Halmos that monadic Boolean algebras are the algebraic counterpart of classical first order monadic calculus, Monteiro considered that the representation of three-valued Łukasiewicz algebras into monadic Boolean algebras gives a proof of the consistency of Łukasiewicz three-valued logic relative to classical logic."17
