<h1>Artificial gravity</h1>
<hr/>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Artificial gravity</strong> is the theoretical increase or decrease of apparent <a href="gravitation" title="wikilink">gravity</a> (<a class="uri" href="g-force" title="wikilink">g-force</a>) by artificial means, particularly in space, but also on Earth. It can be practically achieved by the use of different forces, particularly the <a href="centripetal_force" title="wikilink">centripetal force</a> and <a href="linear_acceleration" title="wikilink">linear acceleration</a>.</p>

<p>The creation of artificial gravity is considered desirable for long-term space travel or habitation, for ease of mobility, for in-space fluid management, and to avoid the adverse long-term <a href="Effect_of_spaceflight_on_the_human_body" title="wikilink">health effects of weightlessness</a>.</p>

<p>A number of methods for generating artificial gravity have been proposed for many years, as well as an even larger number of <a href="science_fiction" title="wikilink">science fiction</a> approaches using both real and <a href="fictitious_force" title="wikilink">fictitious forces</a>. Practical <a href="outer_space" title="wikilink">outer space</a> applications of artificial gravity for humans have not yet been built and flown, principally due to the large size of the spacecraft that would be required to produce the necessary amount of <a href="centripetal_acceleration" title="wikilink">centripetal acceleration</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="requirement-for-gravity">Requirement for gravity</h2>

<p>Without <a class="uri" href="g-force" title="wikilink">g-force</a>, <a href="space_adaptation_syndrome" title="wikilink">space adaptation syndrome</a> occurs in some humans and animals. Many adaptations occur over a few days, but over a long period of time bone density decreases, and some of this decrease may be permanent. The minimal g-force required to avoid bone loss is not known—nearly all current experience is with g-forces of 1 <a href="Standard_gravity" title="wikilink"><em>g</em></a> (on the surface of the Earth) or 0 <em>g</em> in orbit. There has not been sufficient time spent on the Moon to determine whether or not lunar gravity is sufficient.</p>

<p>A limited amount of experimentation has been done by Dr. Alfred Smith, of the <a href="University_of_California" title="wikilink">University of California</a>, with chickens, since they are <a href="biped" title="wikilink">bipeds</a>, and mice experiencing high g-force over long periods in large <a class="uri" href="centrifuges" title="wikilink">centrifuges</a> on the Earth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Rats have been exposed to continuous artificial gravity of 1 <em>g</em> during Russian biosatellite missions lasting two weeks. The muscle and bone loss in these animals was found to be less than rats in 0 <em>g</em>. Astronauts were exposed to artificial gravity levels ranging from 0.2 to 1 <em>g</em> for a few minutes during several spaceflight missions, using linear sleds or rotating chairs. They did not perceive any changes in their spatial orientation when the g level was lower than 0.5 <em>g</em> at the <a href="inner_ear" title="wikilink">inner ear</a> level, where the sensory receptors for gravity perception are located.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="methods-for-generating-artificial-gravity">Methods for generating artificial gravity</h2>

<p>Gravity can be simulated in numerous ways:</p>
<h3 id="rotation">Rotation</h3>

<p> </p>

<p>A rotating spacecraft will produce the feeling of gravity on its inside hull. The rotation drives any object inside the spacecraft toward the hull, thereby giving the appearance of a gravitational pull directed outward. Often referred to as a <a href="centrifugal_force" title="wikilink">centrifugal force</a>, the "pull" is actually a manifestation of the objects inside the spacecraft attempting to travel in a straight line due to inertia. The spacecraft's hull provides the <a href="centripetal_force" title="wikilink">centripetal force</a> required for the objects to travel in a circle (if they continued in a straight line, they would leave the spacecraft's confines). Thus, the gravity felt by the objects is simply the reaction force of the object on the hull reacting to the centripetal force of the hull on the object, in accordance with <a href="Newton's_Third_Law" title="wikilink">Newton's Third Law</a>.</p>

<p>From the <a href="rotating_reference_frame" title="wikilink">point of view of people rotating with the habitat</a>, artificial gravity by rotation behaves in some ways similarly to normal gravity but has the following effects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="Centrifugal_force" title="wikilink">Centrifugal force</a>: Unlike real gravity, which pulls towards a center, this pseudo-force in rotating reference frames gives a rotational 'gravity' that pushes away from the axis of rotation. Artificial gravity levels vary proportionately with the distance from the centre of rotation. With a small radius of rotation, the amount of gravity felt at one's head would be significantly different from the amount felt at one's feet. This could make movement and changing body position awkward. In accordance with the <a href="Centripetal_force#Formula" title="wikilink">physics involved</a>, slower rotations or larger rotational radii would reduce or eliminate this problem, per <a href="Newton's_Third_Law" title="wikilink">Newton's Third Law</a></li>
<li>The <a href="Coriolis_effect" title="wikilink">Coriolis effect</a> gives an apparent force that acts on objects that move relative to a rotating reference frame. This apparent force acts at right angles to the motion and the rotation axis and tends to curve the motion in the opposite sense to the habitat's spin. If an <a class="uri" href="astronaut" title="wikilink">astronaut</a> inside a rotating artificial gravity environment moves towards or away from the axis of rotation, he will feel a force pushing him towards or away from the direction of spin. These forces act on the inner ear and can cause <a class="uri" href="dizziness" title="wikilink">dizziness</a>, <a class="uri" href="nausea" title="wikilink">nausea</a> and disorientation. Lengthening the period of rotation (slower spin rate) reduces the Coriolis force and its effects. It is generally believed that at 2 <a href="Revolutions_per_minute" title="wikilink">rpm</a> or less, no adverse effects from the Coriolis forces will occur; at higher rates some people can become accustomed to it and some do not; but at rates above 7 rpm few if any can become accustomed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> It is not yet known if very long exposures to high levels of Coriolis forces can increase the likelihood of becoming accustomed. The nausea-inducing effects of Coriolis forces can also be mitigated by restraining movement of the head.</li>
</ul>

<p>This form of artificial gravity gives additional system issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kinetic energy: Spinning up parts or all of the habitat requires energy. This would require a propulsion system and propellant of some kind to spin up (or spin down) or a motor and counterweight of some kind (possibly in the form of another living area) to spin in the opposite direction.</li>
<li>Extra strength is needed in the structure to keep it from flying apart due to the rotation. However, the amount of structure needed over and above that to hold a breathable atmosphere (10 tonnes force per square meter at 1 atmosphere) is relatively modest for most structures.</li>
<li>If parts of the structure are intentionally not spinning, <a class="uri" href="friction" title="wikilink">friction</a> and similar <a href="torque" title="wikilink">torques</a> will cause the rates of spin to converge (as well as causing the otherwise-stationary parts to spin), requiring motors and power to be used to compensate for the losses due to friction.</li>
<li>A traversable interface between parts of the station spinning relative to each other requires large vacuum-tight axial seals.</li>

<p>The engineering challenges of creating a rotating spacecraft are comparatively modest to any other proposed approach. Theoretical spacecraft designs using artificial gravity have a great number of variants with intrinsic problems and advantages. To reduce Coriolis forces to livable levels, a rate of spin of 2 rpm or less would be needed. To produce 1<a href="g-force" title="wikilink"><em>g</em></a>, the radius of rotation would have to be 224 m (735 ft) or greater, which would make for a very large spaceship. To reduce mass, the support along the diameter could consist of nothing but a cable connecting two sections of the spaceship, possibly a habitat module and a counterweight consisting of every other part of the spacecraft. It is not yet known if exposure to high gravity for short periods of time is as beneficial to health as continuous exposure to normal gravity. It is also not known how effective low levels of gravity would be to countering the adverse effects on health of weightlessness. Artificial gravity at 0.1<em>g</em> would require a radius of only 22 m (74 ft). Likewise, at a radius of 10 m, about 10 rpm would be required to produce Earth gravity (at the hips; gravity would be 11% higher at the feet), or 14 rpm to produce 2<em>g</em>. If brief exposure to high gravity can negate the health effects of weightlessness, then a small centrifuge could be used as an exercise area.</p>

<p>In <a href="amusement_park" title="wikilink">amusement parks</a>, <a href="pendulum_ride" title="wikilink">pendulum rides</a> and <a href="centrifuge" title="wikilink">centrifuges</a> provide rotational force. <a href="Roller_coaster" title="wikilink">Roller coasters</a> also do, whenever they go over dips, humps, or loops. When going over a hill, time in which zero or negative gravity is felt is called <a class="uri" href="air-time" title="wikilink">air-time</a>, which can be divided into "floater air time" (for zero gravity) and "ejector air time" (for negative gravity).</p>
<h3 id="linear-acceleration">Linear acceleration</h3>

<p>Linear acceleration, even at a low level, can provide sufficient <a class="uri" href="g-force" title="wikilink">g-force</a> to provide useful benefits. Any spacecraft could continuously accelerate in a straight line, forcing objects inside the spacecraft in the opposite direction of the direction of acceleration.</p>

<p>Most <a href="Rocket_engine#Chemically_powered" title="wikilink">chemical</a> <a href="Spacecraft_propulsion#Reaction_engines" title="wikilink">reaction rockets</a> already accelerate at a sufficient rate to produce several times Earth's g-force but can only maintain these accelerations for several minutes because of a limited supply of fuel.</p>

<p>A propulsion system with a very high <a href="specific_impulse" title="wikilink">specific impulse</a> (that is, good efficiency in the use of <a href="reaction_mass" title="wikilink">reaction mass</a> that must be carried along and used for propulsion on the journey) could accelerate more slowly producing useful levels of artificial gravity for long periods of time. A variety of <a href="Spacecraft_propulsion#Electromagnetic_propulsion" title="wikilink">electric propulsion</a> systems provide examples. Two examples of this long-duration, <a href="thrust-to-weight_ratio" title="wikilink">low-thrust</a>, high-impulse propulsion that have either been practically used on spacecraft or are planned in for near-term in-space use are <a href="Hall_effect_thruster" title="wikilink">Hall effect thrusters</a> and <a href="Variable_Specific_Impulse_Magnetoplasma_Rocket" title="wikilink">Variable Specific Impulse Magnetoplasma Rockets</a> (VASIMR). Both provide very high <a href="specific_impulse" title="wikilink">specific impulse</a> but relatively low thrust, compared to the more typical chemical reaction rockets. They are thus ideally suited for long-duration firings which would provide limited amounts of, but long-term, milli-g levels of artificial gravity in spacecraft.</p>

<p>Low-impulse but long-term linear acceleration has been proposed for various interplanetary missions. For example, even heavy (100 <a class="uri" href="tonne" title="wikilink">tonne</a>) cargo payloads to Mars could be transported to Mars in  and retain approximately 55 percent of the <a href="low_Earth_orbit" title="wikilink">LEO</a> vehicle mass upon arrival into a Mars orbit, providing a low-gravity gradient to the spacecraft during the entire journey.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>Constant linear acceleration could theoretically provide relatively short flight times around the solar system. If a propulsion technique able to support 1<em>g</em> of acceleration continuously were available, a spaceship accelerating (and then decelerating for the second half of the journey) at 1<em>g</em> would reach <a class="uri" href="Mars" title="wikilink">Mars</a> within a few days.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>In a number of science fiction plots, acceleration is used to produce artificial gravity for <a href="Interstellar_travel" title="wikilink">interstellar</a> spacecraft, propelled by as yet <a class="uri" href="theoretical" title="wikilink">theoretical</a> or <a href="Spacecraft_propulsion#Hypothetical_methods" title="wikilink">hypothetical</a> means.</p>

<p>This effect of linear acceleration is very well understood, and is routinely used for 0<em>g</em> cryogenic fluid management for post-launch (subsequent) in-space firings of <a href="upper_stage" title="wikilink">upper stage</a> rockets.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p><a href="Roller_coaster" title="wikilink">Roller coasters</a>, especially <a href="launched_roller_coasters" title="wikilink">launched roller coasters</a> or those that rely on <a href="electromagnetic_propulsion" title="wikilink">electromagnetic propulsion</a>, can provide linear acceleration "gravity", and so can relatively high acceleration vehicles, such as <a href="sports_car" title="wikilink">sports cars</a>. Linear acceleration can be used to provide <a class="uri" href="air-time" title="wikilink">air-time</a> on roller coasters and other thrill rides, such as the <a href="Twilight_Zone_Tower_of_Terror" title="wikilink">Twilight Zone Tower of Terror</a>.</p>
<h3 id="magnetism">Magnetism</h3>

<p> A similar effect to gravity has been created through <a class="uri" href="diamagnetism" title="wikilink">diamagnetism</a>. It requires magnets with extremely powerful magnetic fields. Such devices have been made that were able to levitate at most a small mouse<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a> and thus produced a 1 <em>g</em> field to cancel the Earth's. Sufficiently powerful magnets require either expensive <a class="uri" href="cryogenics" title="wikilink">cryogenics</a> to keep them <a class="uri" href="superconductive" title="wikilink">superconductive</a>, or require several megawatts of power.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>With such extremely strong magnetic fields, safety for use with humans is unclear. In addition, it would involve avoiding any ferromagnetic or paramagnetic materials near the strong magnetic field required for diamagnetism to be evident.</p>

<p>Facilities using diamagnetism may prove workable for laboratories simulating low gravity conditions here on Earth. The mouse was levitated against Earth's gravity, creating a condition similar to <a class="uri" href="microgravity" title="wikilink">microgravity</a>. Lower forces may also be generated to simulate a condition similar to lunar or Martian gravity with small <a href="model_organisms" title="wikilink">model organisms</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hypothetical-gravity-generatorgravitomagnetism">Hypothetical gravity generator/gravitomagnetism</h3>

<p>In science fiction, artificial gravity (or cancellation of gravity) or "paragravity"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> is sometimes present in spacecraft that are neither rotating nor accelerating. At present, there is no confirmed technique that can simulate gravity other than actual mass or acceleration. There have been many claims over the years of such a device. <a href="Eugene_Podkletnov" title="wikilink">Eugene Podkletnov</a>, a Russian engineer, has claimed since the early 1990s to have made such a device consisting of a spinning superconductor producing a powerful <a href="Gravitomagnetism" title="wikilink">gravitomagnetic</a> field, but there has been no verification or even negative results from third parties. In 2006, a research group funded by <a href="European_Space_Agency" title="wikilink">ESA</a> claimed to have created a similar device that demonstrated positive results for the production of gravitomagnetism, although it produced only 100 millionths of a <em><a href="standard_gravity" title="wikilink">g</a></em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> <a href="String_theory" title="wikilink">String theory</a> predicts that gravity and electromagnetism unify in hidden dimensions and that extremely short photons can enter those dimensions.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="training-for-high--or-low-gravity-environments">Training for high- or low-gravity environments</h2>
<h3 id="centrifuge">Centrifuge</h3>

<p><strong>High-G training</strong> is done by aviators and astronauts who are subject to high levels of acceleration ('G') in large-radius centrifuges. It is designed to prevent a <em>g-induced Loss Of Consciousness</em> (abbreviated <a class="uri" href="G-LOC" title="wikilink">G-LOC</a>), a situation when <a href="g-force#Human_g-force_experience" title="wikilink"><em>g</em>-forces</a> move the blood away from the brain to the extent that <a class="uri" href="consciousness" title="wikilink">consciousness</a> is lost. Incidents of acceleration-induced loss of consciousness have caused fatal accidents in aircraft capable of sustaining high-<em>g</em> for considerable periods.</p>
<h3 id="parabolic-flight">Parabolic flight</h3>

<p><em>Weightless Wonder</em> is the nickname for the NASA aircraft that flies parabolic trajectories and briefly provides a nearly weightless environment in which to train <a href="astronaut" title="wikilink">astronauts</a>, conduct research, and film motion pictures.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> The parabolic trajectory creates a vertical linear acceleration which matches that of gravity, giving <a class="uri" href="zero-g" title="wikilink">zero-g</a> for a short time, usually 20–30 seconds, followed by approximately 1.8g for a similar period. The nickname <a href="Vomit_Comet" title="wikilink">Vomit Comet</a> is also used to refer to motion sickness that is often experienced by the aircraft passengers during these parabolic trajectories. Such <a href="reduced_gravity_aircraft" title="wikilink">reduced gravity aircraft</a> are nowadays operated by several organizations world wide.</p>

<p>A <strong>Neutral Buoyancy Laboratory</strong> (NBL) is an <a class="uri" href="astronaut" title="wikilink">astronaut</a> training facility, such as the Sonny Carter Training Facility at the <a href="NASA_Johnson_Space_Center" title="wikilink">NASA Johnson Space Center</a> in <a href="Houston,_Texas" title="wikilink">Houston, Texas</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> The NBL is a large indoor pool of water, the largest in the world,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a> in which astronauts may perform simulated <a href="Extra-vehicular_activity" title="wikilink">EVA</a> tasks in preparation for space missions. The NBL contains full-sized mock-ups of the <a href="Space_Shuttle" title="wikilink">Space Shuttle</a> cargo bay, flight payloads, and the <a href="International_Space_Station" title="wikilink">International Space Station</a> (ISS).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a></p>

<p>The principle of <a href="neutral_buoyancy" title="wikilink">neutral buoyancy</a> is used to simulate the weightless environment of space.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> The suited astronauts are lowered into the pool using an <a href="overhead_crane" title="wikilink">overhead crane</a> and their weight is adjusted by support divers so that they experience no <a href="buoyancy" title="wikilink">buoyant</a> force and no <a href="Moment_(physics)" title="wikilink">rotational moment</a> about their <a href="center_of_mass" title="wikilink">center of mass</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> The suits worn in the NBL are down-rated from fully flight-rated <a href="Extravehicular_Mobility_Unit" title="wikilink">EMU</a> suits like those in use on the space shuttle and International Space Station.</p>

<p>The NBL tank itself is  in length,  wide, and  deep, and contains 6.2 million gallons (23.5 million litres) of water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Divers breathe <a class="uri" href="nitrox" title="wikilink">nitrox</a> while working in the tank.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<p>Neutral buoyancy in a pool is not <a class="uri" href="weightlessness" title="wikilink">weightlessness</a>, since the balance organs in the inner ear still sense the up-down direction of gravity. Also, there is a significant amount of <a href="Drag_(physics)" title="wikilink">drag</a> presented by water.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a> Generally, drag effects are minimized by doing tasks slowly in the water. Another difference between neutral buoyancy simulation in a pool and actual EVA during spaceflight is that the temperature of the pool and the lighting conditions are maintained constant.</p>

<p>The <a href="Gemini_11" title="wikilink">Gemini 11</a> mission attempted to produce artificial gravity by rotating the capsule around the <a href="Agena_Target_Vehicle" title="wikilink">Agena Target Vehicle</a> which it was attached to by a 36-meter tether. They were able to generate a small amount of artificial gravity, about 0.00015 g, by firing their side thrusters to slowly rotate the combined craft like a slow-motion pair of <a class="uri" href="bolas" title="wikilink">bolas</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> The resultant force was too small to be felt by either astronaut, but objects were observed moving towards the "floor" of the capsule.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="proposals">Proposals</h2>

<p> There have been a number of proposals that have incorporated artificial gravity into their design.</p>
<ul>
<li>Discovery II: Was a 2005 vehicle proposal capable of delivering a 172 metric ton crew to Jupiter's orbit in only 118 days. A very small portion of the 1,690 mt craft would incorporate a centrifuge where the crew would reside.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="Nautilus-X" title="wikilink">Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle</a> (MMSEV): this 2011 <a class="uri" href="NASA" title="wikilink">NASA</a> proposal for a long-duration crewed space transport vehicle includes a rotational artificial gravity <a href="space_habitat" title="wikilink">space habitat</a> intended to promote crew-health for a crew of up to six persons on missions of up to two years duration. The <a href="gravity" title="wikilink">partial-g</a> <a href="torus" title="wikilink">torus-ring</a> <a class="uri" href="centrifuge" title="wikilink">centrifuge</a> would utilize both standard metal-frame and <a href="Inflatable_space_habitat" title="wikilink">inflatable</a> spacecraft structures and would provide 0.11 to  if built with the  diameter option.<ref name="fiso20110126b"></ref></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><a href="Nautilus-X#ISS_centrifuge_demonstration" title="wikilink">ISS Centrifuge Demo</a>: Also proposed in 2011 as a demonstration project preparatory to the final design of the larger torus centrifuge space habitat for the Multi-Mission Space Exploration Vehicle. The structure would have an outside diameter of  with a  ring interior cross-section diameter and would provide 0.08 to  partial gravity. This test and evaluation centrifuge would have the capability to become a Sleep Module for ISS crew.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a></li>

<li><a href="Mars_Direct" title="wikilink">Mars Direct</a>: A plan for a manned <a class="uri" href="Mars" title="wikilink">Mars</a> mission created by NASA engineers <a href="Robert_Zubrin" title="wikilink">Robert Zubrin</a> and <a href="David_Baker_(aerospace_engineer)" title="wikilink">David Baker</a> in 1990, later expanded upon in Zubrin's 1996 book <a href="The_Case_for_Mars" title="wikilink">The Case for Mars</a>. The "Mars Habitat Unit", which would carry astronauts to Mars to join the previously-launched "Earth Return Vehicle", would have had artificial gravity generated during flight by tying the spent upper stage of the booster to the Habitat Unit, and setting them both rotating about a common axis.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The proposed <a class="uri" href="Tempo3" title="wikilink">Tempo3</a> mission rotates two halves of a spacecraft connected by a tether to test the feasibility of simulating gravity on a manned mission to Mars.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Mars_Gravity_Biosatellite" title="wikilink">Mars Gravity Biosatellite</a> was a proposed mission meant to study the effect of artificial gravity on mammals. An artificial gravity field of 0.38<em>g</em> (<a class="uri" href="Mars" title="wikilink">Mars</a> gravity) was to be produced by rotation (32 rpm, radius of ca. 30 cm). Fifteen mice would have orbited Earth (<a href="Low_Earth_orbit" title="wikilink">Low Earth orbit</a>) for five weeks and then land alive. However the program was canceled on June 24, 2009 due to lack of funding and shifting priorities at NASA.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a></li>
