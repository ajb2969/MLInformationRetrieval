Invested capital

Invested capital represents the total cash investment that shareholders and debtholders have made in a company. There are two different but completely equivalent methods for calculating invested capital.1 The operating approach is calculated as:
Invested capital = operating net working capital + net property, plant & equipment + capitalized operating leases + other operating assets + operating intangibles − other operating liabilities − cumulative adjustment for amortization of R&D;
Equivalently, the financing approach is calculated as




Invested capital =

total debt and leases



+

total equity and equity equivalents



−

non-operating cash and investments



In symbols:



Invested capital is used in several important measurements of financial performance, including return on invested capital, economic value added, and free cash flow.
