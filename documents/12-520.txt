Sharp map

In differential geometry, the sharp map is the mapping that converts coordinate 1-forms into corresponding coordinate basis vectors.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a manifold and 
 
 
 
  denote the space of all sections of its tangent bundle. Fix a nondegenerate (0,2)-tensor field

 
  , i.e., a metric tensor or a symplectic form. The definition


 
  yields a linear map sometimes called the flat map


 
  which is an isomorphism, since 
 
 
 
  is non-degenerate. Its inverse


 
  is called the sharp map.
