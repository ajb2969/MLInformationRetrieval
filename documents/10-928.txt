Enoyl-(acyl-carrier-protein) reductase (NADPH, B-specific)

In enzymology, an enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADPH, B-specific) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + NADP+

 
  trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are trans-2,3-dehydroacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein], NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, to be specific, those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:NADP+ oxidoreductase (B-specific). Other names in common use include acyl-ACP dehydrogenase, reductase, enoyl-[acyl carrier protein] (reduced nicotinamide, adenine dinucleotide phosphate), NADPH 2-enoyl Co A reductase, enoyl acyl-carrier-protein reductase, enoyl-ACP reductase, and enoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] reductase (NADPH, B-specific). This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis.
Structural studies
