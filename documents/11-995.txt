   Triacylglycerol—sterol O-acyltransferase      Triacylglycerol—sterol O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a triacylglycerol---sterol O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   triacylglycerol + a 3beta-hydroxysterol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diacylglycerol + a 3beta-hydroxysterol ester   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are triacylglycerol and 3beta-hydroxysterol , whereas its two products are diacylglycerol and 3beta-hydroxysterol ester .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is triacylglycerol:3beta-hydroxysterol O-acyltransferase . This enzyme is also called triacylglycerol:sterol acyltransferase .
