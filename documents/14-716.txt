   Auslander–Buchsbaum formula      Auslander–Buchsbaum formula   In commutative algebra , the Auslander–Buchsbaum formula , introduced by , states that if R is a commutative Noetherian  local ring and M is a non-zero finitely generated  R -module of finite projective dimension , then          pd  R    (  M  )    +   depth   (  M  )     =   depth   (  R  )     .           subscript  pd  R   M     depth  M      depth  R     \mathrm{pd}_{R}(M)+\mathrm{depth}(M)=\mathrm{depth}(R).     Here pd stands for the projective dimension of a module, and depth for the depth of a module.  Applications  The Auslander–Buchsbaum formula implies that a Noetherian local ring is regular if, and only if, it has finite global dimension . In turn this implies that the localization of a regular local ring is regular.  If A is a local finitely generated R -algebra (over a regular local ring R ), then the Auslander–Buchsbaum formula implies that A is Cohen–Macaulay if, and only if, pd R A = codim R A .
