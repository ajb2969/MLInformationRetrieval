Methylumbelliferyl-acetate deacetylase




Methylumbelliferyl-acetate deacetylase

In enzymology, a methylumbelliferyl-acetate deacetylase (, esterase D) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-methylumbelliferyl acetate + H2O 
 
 
 
  4-methylumbelliferone + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-methylumbelliferyl acetate and H2O, whereas its two products are 4-methylumbelliferone and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-methylumbelliferyl-acetate acylhydrolase. This enzyme is also called esterase D.
