Axiom S5




Axiom S5

Axiom (5) extends the modal logic M, to form the modal logic S5. Which in turn, consists of modal logic called K, in honour of Saul Kripke. It is the most basic modal logic, is formed with propositional calculus formulas and tautologies, and inference apparatus with substitution and modus ponens, but extending the syntax with the modal operator necessarily

 
  and its dual possibly

 
 . To deal with the new formulas of the form 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the following rules complement the inference apparatus of K:

the distribution axiom 
 
 

necessitation rule 
 
 


The logic M is K plus the axiom:

(M) 
 
 


which restricts the accessibility relation of the Kripke frame to be reflexive.
The modal logic S5 is obtained by adding the axiom:

(5) 
 
 


The (5) axiom restricts the accessibility relation

 
 , of the Kripke frame to be euclidean, i.e. 
 
 
 
 .
In S5 formulas of the form 
 
 
 
  can be simplified to 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is formed by any (finite) number of either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  operators or both. The same stands for formulas of the form 
 
 
 
  which can be simplified to 
 
 
 
 .
