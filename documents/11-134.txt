   Ubiquitin—calmodulin ligase      Ubiquitin—calmodulin ligase   In enzymology , an ubiquitin-calmodulin ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   n ATP + calmodulin + n ubiquitin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   n AMP + n diphosphate + (ubiquitin)n-calmodulin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , calmodulin , and ubiquitin , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and (ubiquitin)n-calmodulin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is calmodulin:ubiquitin ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include ubiquityl-calmodulin synthase , ubiquitin-calmodulin synthetase , ubiquityl-calmodulin synthetase , and uCaM-synthetase .
