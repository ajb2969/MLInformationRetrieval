   Phase-type distribution      Phase-type distribution   A phase-type distribution is a probability distribution constructed by a convolution of exponential distributions . 1 It results from a system of one or more inter-related Poisson processes occurring in sequence , or phases. The sequence in which each of the phases occur may itself be a stochastic process . The distribution can be represented by a random variable describing the time until absorption of a Markov process with one absorbing state. Each of the states of the Markov process represents one of the phases.  It has a discrete time equivalent the discrete phase-type distribution .  The set of phase-type distributions is dense in the field of all positive-valued distributions, that is, it can be used to approximate any positive-valued distribution.  Definition  Consider a continuous-time Markov process with m +¬†1 states, where m ‚â•¬†1, such that the states 1,..., m are transient states and state 0 is an absorbing state. Further, let the process have an initial probability of starting in any of the m +¬†1 phases given by the probability vector ( Œ± 0 , Œ± ) where Œ± 0 is a scalar and Œ± is a 1¬†√ó m vector.  The continuous phase-type distribution is the distribution of time from the above process's starting until absorption in the absorbing state.  This process can be written in the form of a transition rate matrix ,       Q  =   [     0    ùüé       ùêí  0     S     ]    ,      Q   delimited-[]    0  0     superscript  ùêí  0   S       {Q}=\left[\begin{matrix}0&\mathbf{0}\\
 \mathbf{S}^{0}&{S}\\
 \end{matrix}\right],     where S is an m √ó m matrix and ''S '' 0 = ‚ÄìS 1 . Here 1 represents an m √ó¬†1 vector with every element being¬†1.  Characterization  The distribution of time X until the process reaches the absorbing state is said to be phase-type distributed and is denoted PH( Œ± , S ).  The distribution function of X is given by,        F   (  x  )    =   1  -   ùú∂   exp   (   S  x   )    ùüè     ,        F  x     1    ùú∂      S  x    1      F(x)=1-\boldsymbol{\alpha}\exp({S}x)\mathbf{1},     and the density function,        f   (  x  )    =   ùú∂   exp   (   S  x   )     ùêí  ùüé     ,        f  x     ùú∂      S  x     superscript  ùêí  0      f(x)=\boldsymbol{\alpha}\exp({S}x)\mathbf{S^{0}},     for all x > 0, where exp(¬†¬∑¬†) is the matrix exponential . It is usually assumed the probability of process starting in the absorbing state is zero (i.e. Œ± 0 = 0). The moments of the distribution function are given by       E   [   X  n   ]    =     (   -  1   )   n    n  !   ùú∂   S   -  n    1.         E   delimited-[]   superscript  X  n        superscript    1   n     n   ùú∂   superscript  S    n    1.     E[X^{n}]=(-1)^{n}n!\boldsymbol{\alpha}{S}^{-n}\mathbf{1}.     Special cases  The following probability distributions are all considered special cases of a continuous phase-type distribution:   Degenerate distribution , point mass at zero or the empty phase-type distribution - 0 phases.  Exponential distribution - 1 phase.  Erlang distribution - 2 or more identical phases in sequence.  Deterministic distribution (or constant) - The limiting case of an Erlang distribution, as the number of phases become infinite, while the time in each state becomes zero.  Coxian distribution - 2 or more (not necessarily identical) phases in sequence, with a probability of transitioning to the terminating/absorbing state after each phase.  Hyper-exponential distribution (also called a mixture of exponential) - 2 or more non-identical phases, that each have a probability of occurring in a mutually exclusive, or parallel, manner. (Note: The exponential distribution is the degenerate situation when all the parallel phases are identical.)  Hypoexponential distribution - 2 or more phases in sequence, can be non-identical or a mixture of identical and non-identical phases, generalises the Erlang.   As the phase-type distribution is dense in the field of all positive-valued distributions, we can represent any positive valued distribution. However, the phase-type is a light-tailed or platikurtic distribution. So the representation of heavy-tailed or leptokurtic distribution by phase type is an approximation, even if the precision of the approximation can be as good as we want.  Examples  In all the following examples it is assumed that there is no probability mass at zero, that is Œ± 0 = 0.  Exponential distribution  The simplest non-trivial example of a phase-type distribution is the exponential distribution of parameter Œª. The parameter of the phase-type distribution are : S = -Œª and Œ± = 1.  Hyper-exponential or mixture of exponential distribution  The mixture of exponential or hyper-exponential distribution with Œª 1 ,Œª 2 ,...,Œª n >0 can be represented as a phase type distribution with      ùú∂  =   (   Œ±  1   ,   Œ±  2   ,   Œ±  3   ,   Œ±  4   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   Œ±  n   )       ùú∂    subscript  Œ±  1    subscript  Œ±  2    subscript  Œ±  3    subscript  Œ±  4   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  Œ±  n      \boldsymbol{\alpha}=(\alpha_{1},\alpha_{2},\alpha_{3},\alpha_{4},...,\alpha_{n})   with      ‚àë   i  =  1   n    Œ±  i    =  1        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  Œ±  i    1    \sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}=1   and       S  =   [      -   Œª  1      0    0    0    0      0     -   Œª  2      0    0    0      0    0     -   Œª  3      0    0      0    0    0     -   Œª  4      0      0    0    0    0     -   Œª  5       ]    .

The Erlang distribution can be written in the form of a phase-type distribution by making S a k √ó k matrix with diagonal elements -Œª and super-diagonal elements Œª, with the probability of starting in state 1 equal to 1.

For a given number of phases, the Erlang distribution is the phase type distribution with smallest coefficient of variation. 2  The hypoexponential distribution is a generalisation of the Erlang distribution by having different rates for each transition (the non-homogeneous case).  Mixture of Erlang distribution  The mixture of two Erlang distribution with parameter E (3,Œ≤ 1 ), E (3,Œ≤ 2 ) and (Œ± 1 ,Œ± 2 ) (such that Œ± 1 + Œ± 2 = 1 and for each i , Œ± i ‚â• 0) can be represented as a phase type distribution with       ùú∂  =   (   Œ±  1   ,  0  ,  0  ,   Œ±  2   ,  0  ,  0  )    ,      ùú∂    subscript  Œ±  1   0  0   subscript  Œ±  2   0  0     \boldsymbol{\alpha}=(\alpha_{1},0,0,\alpha_{2},0,0),     and       S  =   [      -   Œ≤  1       Œ≤  1     0    0    0    0      0     -   Œ≤  1       Œ≤  1     0    0    0      0    0     -   Œ≤  1      0    0    0      0    0    0     -   Œ≤  2       Œ≤  2     0      0    0    0    0     -   Œ≤  2       Œ≤  2       0    0    0    0    0     -   Œ≤  2       ]    .

Instead of only being able to enter the absorbing state from state k it can be reached from any phase.

In the case where all p i = 1 we have the hypoexponential distribution. The Coxian distribution is extremely important as any acyclic phase-type distribution has an equivalent Coxian representation.  The generalised Coxian distribution relaxes the condition that requires starting in the first phase.  Generating samples from phase-type distributed random variables  BuTools includes methods for generating samples from phase-type distributed random variables. 3  Approximating other distributions  Any distribution can be arbitrarily well approximated by a phase type distribution. 4 5 In practice, however, approximations can be poor when the size of the approximating process is fixed. Approximating a deterministic distribution of time 1 with 10 phases, each of average length 0.1 will have variance 0.1 (because the Erlang distribution has smallest variance 6 ).

It provides a graphical user interface and yields good fitting results with only little user interaction. 12  jPhase is a Java library which can also compute metrics for queues using the fitted phase type distribution 13   See also   Discrete phase-type distribution  Continuous-time Markov process  Exponential distribution  Hyper-exponential distribution  Queueing theory   References   M.
