   Pyrroloquinoline-quinone synthase      Pyrroloquinoline-quinone synthase   In enzymology , a pyrroloquinoline-quinone synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-7,8-dioxo-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydroquinoline-2,4-dicarboxylate + 3 O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4,5-dioxo-3a,4,5,6,7,8,9,9b-octahydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-f]quinoline- 2,7,9-tricarboxylate + 2 H 2 O 2 + 2 H 2 O   The two substrates of this enzyme are 6-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-7,8-dioxo-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydroquinoline-2,4-dicarboxylate, and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 4,5-dioxo-3a,4,5,6,7,8,9,9b-octahydro-1H-pyrrolo[2,3-f]quinoline-2,7,9-tricarboxylate, H 2 O 2 , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)-7,8-dioxo-1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8-octahydroquinol ine-2,4-dicarboxylate:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing) . This enzyme is also called PqqC .  References         "  Category:EC 1.3.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
