   Bessel–Clifford function      Bessel–Clifford function   In mathematical analysis , the Bessel–Clifford function , named after Friedrich Bessel and William Kingdon Clifford , is an entire function of two complex variables that can be used to provide an alternative development of the theory of Bessel functions . If       π   (  x  )    =   1   Π   (  x  )     =   1   Γ   (   x  +  1   )             π  x     1    normal-Π  x           1    normal-Γ    x  1        \pi(x)=\frac{1}{\Pi(x)}=\frac{1}{\Gamma(x+1)}     is the entire function defined by means of the reciprocal Gamma function , then the Bessel–Clifford function is defined by the series        𝒞  n    (  z  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞    π   (   k  +  n   )     z  k    k  !             subscript  𝒞  n   z     superscript   subscript     k  0        π    k  n      superscript  z  k     k        {\mathcal{C}}_{n}(z)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\pi(k+n)\frac{z^{k}}{k!}     The ratio of successive terms is z / k ( n + k ), which for all values of z and n tends to zero with increasing k . By the ratio test , this series converges absolutely for all z and n , and uniformly for all regions with bounded | z |, and hence the Bessel–Clifford function is an entire function of the two complex variables n and z .  Differential equation of the Bessel–Clifford function  It follows from the above series on differentiating with respect to x that     𝒞  n    (  x  )        subscript  𝒞  n   x    {\mathcal{C}}_{n}(x)   satisfies the linear second-order homogeneous differential equation      x   y  ′′   +   (  n  +  1  )    y  ′   =  y  .     fragments  x   superscript  y  ′′     fragments  normal-(  n   1  normal-)    superscript  y  normal-′    y  normal-.  italic-    xy^{\prime\prime}+(n+1)y^{\prime}=y.\qquad     This equation is of generalized hypergeometric type, and in fact the Bessel–Clifford function is up to a scaling factor a Pochhammer–Barnes hypergeometric function ; we have       𝒞  n    (  z  )   =  π    (  n  )   0    F  1    (  ;  n  +  1  ;  z  )   .     fragments   subscript  𝒞  n    fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)    π   subscript   fragments  normal-(  n  normal-)   0    subscript  F  1    fragments  normal-(  normal-;  n   1  normal-;  z  normal-)   normal-.    {\mathcal{C}}_{n}(z)=\pi(n)\ _{0}F_{1}(;n+1;z).     Unless n is a negative integer, in which case the right hand side is undefined, the two definitions are essentially equivalent; the hypergeometric function being normalized so that its value at z = 0 is one.  Relation to Bessel functions  The Bessel function of the first kind can be defined in terms of the Bessel–Clifford function as         J  n    (  z  )    =     (   z  2   )   n    𝒞  n    (   -    z  2   4    )     ;         subscript  J  n   z      superscript    z  2   n    subscript  𝒞  n        superscript  z  2   4       J_{n}(z)=\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^{n}{\mathcal{C}}_{n}\left(-\frac{z^{2}}{4}%
 \right);     when n is not an integer we can see from this that the Bessel function is not entire. Similarly, the modified Bessel function of the first kind can be defined as         I  n    (  z  )    =     (   z  2   )   n    𝒞  n    (    z  2   4   )     .         subscript  I  n   z      superscript    z  2   n    subscript  𝒞  n      superscript  z  2   4      I_{n}(z)=\left(\frac{z}{2}\right)^{n}{\mathcal{C}}_{n}\left(\frac{z^{2}}{4}%
 \right).     The procedure can of course be reversed, so that we may define the Bessel–Clifford function as         𝒞  n    (  z  )    =    z   -   n  /  2      I  n    (   2   z    )     ;         subscript  𝒞  n   z      superscript  z      n  2      subscript  I  n     2    z       {\mathcal{C}}_{n}(z)=z^{-n/2}I_{n}(2\sqrt{z});     but from this starting point we would then need to show   𝒞   𝒞   {\mathcal{C}}   was entire.  Recurrence relation  From the defining series, it follows immediately that       d   d  x     𝒞  n    (  x  )    =    𝒞   n  +  1     (  x  )     .          d    d  x     subscript  𝒞  n   x      subscript  𝒞    n  1    x     \frac{d}{dx}{\mathcal{C}}_{n}(x)={\mathcal{C}}_{n+1}(x).     Using this, we may rewrite the differential equation for   𝒞   𝒞   {\mathcal{C}}   as         x   𝒞   n  +  2     (  x  )    +    (   n  +  1   )    𝒞   n  +  1     (  x  )     =    𝒞  n    (  x  )     ,          x   subscript  𝒞    n  2    x       n  1    subscript  𝒞    n  1    x       subscript  𝒞  n   x     x{\mathcal{C}}_{n+2}(x)+(n+1){\mathcal{C}}_{n+1}(x)={\mathcal{C}}_{n}(x),     which defines the recurrence relationship for the Bessel–Clifford function. This is equivalent to a similar relation for 0 F 1 . We have, as a special case of Gauss's continued fraction          𝒞   n  +  1     (  x  )      𝒞  n    (  x  )     =   1   n  +  1  +    x   n  +  2  +    x   n  +  3  +    x  ⋱             .           subscript  𝒞    n  1    x      subscript  𝒞  n   x     continued-fraction  1    n  1   continued-fraction  x    n  2   continued-fraction  x    n  3   continued-fraction  x  normal-⋱           \frac{{\mathcal{C}}_{n+1}(x)}{{\mathcal{C}}_{n}(x)}=\cfrac{1}{n+1+\cfrac{x}{n+%
 2+\cfrac{x}{n+3+\cfrac{x}{\ddots}}}}.     It can be shown that this continued fraction converges in all cases.  The Bessel–Clifford function of the second kind  The Bessel–Clifford differential equation         x   y  ′′    +    (   n  +  1   )    y  ′     =  y           x   superscript  y  ′′        n  1    superscript  y  normal-′     y    xy^{\prime\prime}+(n+1)y^{\prime}=y\qquad     has two linearly independent solutions. Since the origin is a regular singular point of the differential equation, and since   𝒞   𝒞   {\mathcal{C}}   is entire, the second solution must be singular at the origin.  If we set        𝒦  n    (  x  )    =    1  2     ∫  0  ∞     exp   (    -  t   -   x  t    )      d  t    t   n  +  1               subscript  𝒦  n   x       1  2     superscript   subscript   0             t     x  t         d  t    superscript  t    n  1          {\mathcal{K}}_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{0}^{\infty}\exp\left(-t-\frac{x}{t}%
 \right)\frac{dt}{t^{n+1}}     which converges for     ℜ   (  x  )    >  0        x   0    \Re(x)>0   , and analytically continue it, we obtain a second linearly independent solution to the differential equation.  The factor of 1/2 is inserted in order to make   𝒦   𝒦   {\mathcal{K}}   correspond to the Bessel functions of the second kind. We have         K  n    (  x  )    =     (   x  2   )   n    𝒦  n    (    x  2   4   )     .         subscript  K  n   x      superscript    x  2   n    subscript  𝒦  n      superscript  x  2   4      K_{n}(x)=\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{n}{\mathcal{K}}_{n}\left(\frac{x^{2}}{4}%
 \right).     and         Y  n    (  x  )    =     (   x  2   )   n    𝒦  n    (   -    x  2   4    )     .         subscript  Y  n   x      superscript    x  2   n    subscript  𝒦  n        superscript  x  2   4       Y_{n}(x)=\left(\frac{x}{2}\right)^{n}{\mathcal{K}}_{n}\left(-\frac{x^{2}}{4}%
 \right).     In terms of K , we have         𝒦  n    (  x  )    =    x   -   n  /  2      K  n    (   2   x    )     .         subscript  𝒦  n   x      superscript  x      n  2      subscript  K  n     2    x       {\mathcal{K}}_{n}(x)=x^{-n/2}K_{n}(2\sqrt{x}).     Hence just as the Bessel function and modified Bessel function of the first kind can both be expressed in terms of   𝒞   𝒞   {\mathcal{C}}   , those of the second kind can both be expressed in terms of   𝒦   𝒦   {\mathcal{K}}   .  Generating function  If we multiply the absolutely convergent series for exp( t ) and exp( z / t ) together, we get (when t is not zero) an absolutely convergent series for exp( t + z / t ). Collecting terms in t , we find on comparison with the power series definition for    𝒞  n     subscript  𝒞  n    {\mathcal{C}}_{n}   that we have        exp   (   t  +   z  t    )    =    ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     t  n    𝒞  n    (  z  )      .          t    z  t       superscript   subscript     n             superscript  t  n    subscript  𝒞  n   z      \exp\left(t+\frac{z}{t}\right)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}t^{n}{\mathcal{C}}_{n}%
 (z).     This generating function can then be used to obtain further formulas, in particular we may use Cauchy's integral formula and obtain    𝒞  n     subscript  𝒞  n    {\mathcal{C}}_{n}   for integer n as       𝒞  n    (  z  )   =   1   2  π  i     ∮  C      exp   (   z  +   z  /  t    )     t   n  +  1      d  t  =   1   2  π     ∫  0   2  π    exp   (  z   (  1  +  exp   (  -  i  θ  )   )   -  n  i  θ  )   )  d  θ  .     fragments   subscript  𝒞  n    fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)      1    2  π  i     subscript  contour-integral  C         z    z  t      superscript  t    n  1     d  t     1    2  π     superscript   subscript   0     2  π      fragments  normal-(  z   fragments  normal-(  1     fragments  normal-(   i  θ  normal-)   normal-)    n  i  θ  normal-)   normal-)  d  θ  normal-.    {\mathcal{C}}_{n}(z)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\oint_{C}\frac{\exp(z+z/t)}{t^{n+1}}\,dt=%
 \frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\exp(z(1+\exp(-i\theta))-ni\theta))\,d\theta.     References    .   .   .   .   .   .   "  Category:Special hypergeometric functions
