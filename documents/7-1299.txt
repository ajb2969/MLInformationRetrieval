   Infinite dihedral group      Infinite dihedral group   In mathematics , the infinite dihedral group Dih ∞ is an infinite group with properties analogous to those of the finite dihedral groups .  In two dimensional geometry, the infinite dihedral group represents the 4th frieze group symmetry, p1m1 , seen as an infinite set of parallel reflections along an axis.  Definition  Every dihedral group is generated by a rotation r and a reflection; if the rotation is a rational multiple of a full rotation, then there is some integer n such that r n is the identity, and we have a finite dihedral group of order 2 n . If the rotation is not a rational multiple of a full rotation, then there is no such n and the resulting group has infinitely many elements and is called Dih ∞ . It has presentations      ⟨   r  ,  s   ∣     s  2   =  1   ,    s  r  s   =   r   -  1      ⟩     inner-product   r  s    formulae-sequence     superscript  s  2   1       s  r  s    superscript  r    1        \langle r,s\mid s^{2}=1,srs=r^{-1}\rangle\,\!         ⟨   x  ,  y   ∣    x  2   =   y  2   =  1   ⟩     inner-product   x  y        superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        1      \langle x,y\mid x^{2}=y^{2}=1\rangle\,\!    1  and is isomorphic to a semidirect product of Z and Z /2, and to the free product  Z /2 * Z /2. It is the automorphism group of the graph consisting of a path infinite to both sides. Correspondingly, it is the isometry group of Z (see also symmetry groups in one dimension ), the group of permutations α: Z → Z satisfying | i - j | = |α( i ) - α( j )|, for all i, j in Z . 2  The infinite dihedral group can also be defined as the holomorph of the infinite cyclic group .  Aliasing  A concrete example of infinite dihedral symmetry is in aliasing of real-valued signals; this is realized as follows. If sampling a signal ( signal processing term for a function) at frequency f s , then the functions sin( ft ) and sin(( f + f s ) t ) cannot be distinguished (and likewise for cos), which gives the translation ( r ) element – translation by f s (the detected frequency is periodic ). Further, for a real signal, cos(− ft ) = cos( ft ) and sin(− ft ) = −sin( ft ), so every negative frequency has a corresponding positive frequency (this is not true for complex signals), and gives the reflection ( f ) element, namely f ↦ − f . Together these give further reflection symmetries, at 0.5 f s , f s , 1.5 f s , etc.; this phenomenon is called folding , as the graph of the detected signal "folds back" on itself, as depicted in the diagram at right.  Formally, the quotient under aliasing is the orbifold [0, 0.5 f s ], with a Z /2 action at the endpoints (the orbifold points), corresponding to reflection.
