   Allose kinase      Allose kinase   In enzymology , an allose kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + D-allose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + D-allose 6-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-allose , whereas its two products are ADP and D-allose 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-allose 6-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include allokinase (phosphorylating) , allokinase , D-allokinase , and D-allose-6-kinase .
