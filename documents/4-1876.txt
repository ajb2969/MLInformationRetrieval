   Amber (color)      Amber (color)   (Figure)  These pendants made of amber are also amber-colored .   The color amber is a pure chroma color, located on the color wheel midway between the color gold and orange . The color-name is derived from the material also known as amber , which is commonly found in a range of yellow-orange-brown-red colors; likewise, as a color amber can refer to a range of yellow-orange colors. In English the first recorded use of the term as a color-name, rather than a reference to the specific substance, was in 1500. 1  SAE/ECE amber  Amber is one of several technically defined colors used in automotive signal lamps. In North America, SAE standard J578 governs the colorimetry of vehicle lights, 2 while outside North America the internationalized European ECE regulations hold force. 3 Both standards designate a range of orange-yellow hues in the CIE color space as "amber".  In the past, the ECE amber definition was more restrictive than the SAE definition, but the current ECE definition is identical to the more permissive SAE standard. The SAE formally uses the term "yellow amber", though the color is most often referred to as "yellow". This is not the same as selective yellow , a color used in some fog lamps and headlamps .  Formal definitions  (Figure)  A turn signal emitting amber light.   Previously, ECE amber was defined according to the 1968 Convention on Road Traffic, 4 as follows:      Limit towards green       y  ≤  0.429      y  0.429    y\leq 0.429        Limit towards red       y  ≥  0.398      y  0.398    y\geq 0.398        Limit towards white       z  ≤  0.007      z  0.007    z\leq 0.007        Recent revisions to the ECE regulations have aligned ECE Amber with SAE Yellow , defined as follows:      Limit towards green       y  ≤   x  -  0.120       y    x  0.120     y\leq x-0.120        Limit towards red       y  ≥  0.390      y  0.390    y\geq 0.390        Limit towards white       y  ≥   0.790  -   0.670  x        y    0.790    0.670  x      y\geq 0.790-0.670x        The entirety of these definitions lie outside the gamut of the sRGB color space — such a pure color cannot be represented using RGB primaries. The color box shown above is a desaturated approximation, created by taking the centroid of the standard definition and moving it towards the D65 white point , until it meets the sRGB gamut triangle. {{-}}  Amber in culture  Computers   VT220 computer terminals were available with amber phosphors on their CRTs .   Interior design   The original Amber Room in the Catherine Palace of Tsarskoye Selo near Saint Petersburg was a complete chamber decoration of amber panels backed with gold leaf and mirrors . Due to its singular beauty, it was sometimes dubbed the Eighth Wonder of the World .   Sports   In gaelic games  Armagh play in a darker Amber color (the amber that is prevalent in the Irish flag ), Offaly play in the original colors of the Irish flag (Green, white and Amber) and Kilkenny also play in black and amber, albeit a more yellow amber.  Amber is a color worn by English Football Clubs Hull City AFC , Bradford City AFC , Barnet FC , Shrewsbury Town FC (As part of stripes), Mansfield Town and Cambridge United FC . The color is also worn by the Scottish football club Motherwell FC , as well as many other sports clubs around the world.   Transportation planning   Amber is used in traffic lights and turn signals .   Amber is also used in business management to indicate a status of work as in RAG status. R stands for Red, A stands for Amber, usually represented as Yellow color in the reports and G standing for Green. Typically Green indicates that all is well, no action needed, Yellow indicates a wait and watch approach or some actions to make the status green, and Red indicating that the work/project is not as planned and requires immediate attention and corrective actions to turn the project/work to Green status.
