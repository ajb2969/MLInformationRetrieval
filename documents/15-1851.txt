   Diophantine quintuple      Diophantine quintuple   In mathematics, a diophantine m -tuple is a set of m positive integers    {   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,   a  4   ,  …  ,   a  m   }      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3    subscript  a  4   normal-…   subscript  a  m     \{a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},a_{4},\ldots,a_{m}\}   such that      a  i    a  j    +  1         subscript  a  i    subscript  a  j    1    a_{i}a_{j}+1   is a perfect square for any    1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  m        1  i       j       m     1\leq i   . 1  Diophantus himself found the set    {   1  16   ,   33  16   ,   17  4   ,   105  16   }       1  16     33  16     17  4     105  16     \left\{\frac{1}{16},\frac{33}{16},\frac{17}{4},\frac{105}{16}\right\}   of rationals which has the property that each      a  i    a  j    +  1         subscript  a  i    subscript  a  j    1    a_{i}a_{j}+1   is a rational square . 2 More recently, sets of six positive rationals have been found. 3  The first diophantine quadruple was found by Fermat     {  1  ,  3  ,  8  ,  120  }     1  3  8  120    \{1,3,8,120\}   . 4 It was proved in 1969 by Baker and Davenport 5 that a fifth positive integer cannot be added to this set. However, Euler was able to extend this set by adding the rational number    777480  8288641      777480  8288641    \frac{777480}{8288641}   . 6  No ( integer ) diophantine quintuples are known, and it is an open problem whether any exist. 7 Dujella has shown that at most a finite number of diophantine quintuples exist. 8  References  External links   Andrej Dujella's pages on diophantine m -tuples   "  Category:Diophantine equations       ↩      ↩
