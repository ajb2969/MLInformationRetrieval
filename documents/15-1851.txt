Diophantine quintuple

In mathematics, a diophantine m-tuple is a set of m positive integers 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is a perfect square for any 
 
 
 
 .1
Diophantus himself found the set 
 
 
 
  of rationals which has the property that each 
 
 
 
  is a rational square.2 More recently, sets of six positive rationals have been found.3
The first diophantine quadruple was found by Fermat

 
 .4 It was proved in 1969 by Baker and Davenport 5 that a fifth positive integer cannot be added to this set. However, Euler was able to extend this set by adding the rational number 
 
 
 
 .6
No (integer) diophantine quintuples are known, and it is an open problem whether any exist.7 Dujella has shown that at most a finite number of diophantine quintuples exist.8
