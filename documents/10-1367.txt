   3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase      3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-hydroxy-1H-quinolin-4-one + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-formylanthranilate + CO   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-hydroxy-1H-quinolin-4-one and O 2 , whereas its two products are N-formylanthranilate and CO .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxy-1H-quinolin-4-one 2,4-dioxygenase (CO-forming) . Other names in common use include (1H)-3-hydroxy-4-oxoquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase , 3-hydroxy-4-oxo-1,4-dihydroquinoline 2,4-dioxygenase , 3-hydroxy-4(1H)-one, 2,4-dioxygenase , and quinoline-3,4-diol 2,4-dioxygenase .
