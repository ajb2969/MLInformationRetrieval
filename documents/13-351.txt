Spectral signal-to-noise ratio

In applied mathematics, the two-dimensional Spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) measures the normalised cross-correlation coefficient between several two-dimensional images over corresponding rings in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency . It is a multi-particle extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC), which is related to the Fourier shell correlation. The SSNR is a popular method for finding the resolution of a class average in cryo-electron microscopy.
