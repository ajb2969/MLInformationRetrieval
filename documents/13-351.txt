   Spectral signal-to-noise ratio      Spectral signal-to-noise ratio   In applied mathematics , the two-dimensional Spectral signal-to-noise ratio (SSNR) measures the normalised cross-correlation coefficient between several two-dimensional images over corresponding rings in Fourier space as a function of spatial frequency . It is a multi-particle extension of the Fourier ring correlation (FRC), which is related to the Fourier shell correlation . The SSNR is a popular method for finding the resolution of a class average in cryo-electron microscopy .  Calculation       S  S  N  R   (  r  )    =       ∑    r  i   ∈  R       |     ∑   k  i      F    r  i   ,  k     |   2       K   K  -  1        ∑    r  i   ∈  R        ∑   k  i       |    F    r  i   ,  k    -    F  ¯    r  i     |   2       -  1         S  S  N  R  r         subscript      subscript  r  i   R     superscript      subscript    subscript  k  i     subscript  F    subscript  r  i   k      2        K    K  1      subscript      subscript  r  i   R      subscript    subscript  k  i     superscript       subscript  F    subscript  r  i   k     subscript   normal-¯  F    subscript  r  i      2       1     SSNR(r)=\frac{\displaystyle\sum_{r_{i}\in R}\left|\sum_{k_{i}}{F_{r_{i},k}}%

It is possible convert the SSNR into an equivalent FRC using the following formula:       F  R  C   =    S  S  N  R     S  S  N  R   +  1          F  R  C       S  S  N  R       S  S  N  R   1      FRC=\frac{SSNR}{SSNR+1}     See also   Resolution (electron density)  Fourier shell correlation   Notes  References           "  Category:Applied mathematics  Category:Engineering ratios  Category:Measurement  Category:Microscopes
