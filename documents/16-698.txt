   Suspension of a ring      Suspension of a ring   In algebra, more specifically in algebraic K-theory , the suspension    Σ  R      normal-Σ  R    \Sigma R   of a ring R is given by 1      Σ   (  R  )    =     C   (  R  )    /  M    (  R  )          normal-Σ  R         C  R   M   R     \Sigma(R)=C(R)/M(R)   where    C   (  R  )       C  R    C(R)   is the ring of all infinite matrices with coefficients in R having only finitely many nonzero elements in each row or column and    M   (  R  )       M  R    M(R)   is its ideal of matrices having only finitely many nonzero elements. It is an analog of suspension in topology.  One then has      K  i    (  R  )    ≃    K   i  +  1     (   Σ  R   )       similar-to-or-equals     subscript  K  i   R      subscript  K    i  1      normal-Σ  R      K_{i}(R)\simeq K_{i+1}(\Sigma R)   .
