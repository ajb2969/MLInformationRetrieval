Suspension of a ring

In algebra, more specifically in algebraic K-theory, the suspension 
 
 
 
  of a ring R is given by1

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the ring of all infinite matrices with coefficients in R having only finitely many nonzero elements in each row or column and 
 
 
 
  is its ideal of matrices having only finitely many nonzero elements. It is an analog of suspension in topology.
One then has
