Argumentation framework

An argumentation framework, or argumentation system, is a way to deal with contentious information and draw conclusions from it.
In an abstract argumentation framework,1 entry-level information is a set of abstract arguments that, for instance, represent data or a proposition. Conflicts between arguments are represented by a binary relation on the set of arguments. In concrete terms, you represent an argumentation framework with a directed graph such that the nodes are the arguments, and the arrows represent the attack relation. There exist some extensions of the Dung's framework, like the logic-based argumentation frameworks2 or the value-based argumentation frameworks.3
Abstract argumentation frameworks
Formal framework
Abstract argumentation frameworks, also called argumentation frameworks à la Dung, are defined formally as a pair:

A set of abstract elements called arguments, denoted 
 
 

A binary relation on 
 
 
 
 , called attack relation, denoted 
 
 


thumb|left|upright=1|The graph built from the system 
 
 
 
 . For instance, the argumentation system 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  contains four arguments (
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) and three attacks (
 
 
 
  attacks 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  attacks 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  attacks 
 
 
 
 ).
Dung defines some notions :

an argument 
 
 
 
  is acceptable with respect to 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  defends 
 
 
 
 , that is 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ,
a set of arguments 
 
 
 
  is conflict-free if there is no attack between its arguments, formally 
 
 
 
 ,
a set of arguments 
 
 
 
  is admissible if and only if it is conflict-free and all its arguments are acceptables with respect to 
 
 
 
 .

Different semantics of acceptance
Extensions
To decide if an argument can be accepted or not, or if several arguments can be accepted together, Dung defines several semantics of acceptance that allow, given an argumentation system, to compute sets of arguments, called extensions. For instance, given 
 
 
 
 ,



 
  is a complete extension of 
 
 
 
  only if it is an admissible set and every acceptable argument with respect to 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is a preferred extension of 
 
 
 
  only if it is a maximal element (with respect to the set-theoretical inclusion) among the admissible sets with respect to 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is a stable extension of 
 
 
 
  only if it is a conflict-free set that attacks every argument that does not belong in 
 
 
 
  (formally, 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is the (unique) grounded extension of 
 
 
 
  only if it is the smallest element (with respect to set inclusion) among the complete extensions of 
 
 
 
 .

There exists some inclusions between the sets of extensions built with these semantics :

Every stable extension is preferred,
Every preferred extension is complete,
The grounded extension is complete,
If the system is well founded (there exists no infinite sequence 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ), all these semantics coincide—only one extension is grounded, stable, preferred, and complete.

Some other semantics have been defined.For instance,

Ideal : see Dung, Mancarella and Toni (2006)
Eager : see Caminada (2007)

One introduce the notation 
 
 
 
  to note the set of 
 
 
 
 -extensions of the system 
 
 
 
 .
In the case of the system 
 
 
 
  in the figure above, 
 
 
 
  for every Dung's semantic—the system is well-founded. That explains why the semantics coincide, and the accepted arguments are
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Labellings
Labellings are a more expressive way than extensions to express the acceptance of the arguments. Concretely, a labelling is a mapping that associates every argument with a label in (the argument is accepted), out (the argument is rejected), or undec (the argument is undefined—not accepted or refused). One can also note a labelling as a set of pairs 
 
 
 
 .
Such a mapping does not make sense without additional constraint. The notion of reinstatement labelling guarantees the sense of the mapping. 
 
 
 
  is a reinstatement labelling on the system 
 
 
 
  if and only if :



 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 



 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 



 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 


One can convert every extension into a reinstatement labelling: the arguments of the extension are in, those attacked by an argument of the extension are out, and the others are undec. Conversely, one can build an extension from a reinstatement labelling just by keeping the arguments in. Indeed, Caminada4 proved that the reinstatement labellings and the complete extensions can be mapped in a bijective way. Moreover, the other Datung's semantics can be associated to some particular sets of reinstatement labellings.
Reinstatement labellings distinguish arguments not accepted because they are attacked by accepted arguments from undefined arguments—that is, those that are not defended cannot defend themselves. An argument is undec if it is attacked by at least another undec. If it is attacked only by arguments out, it must be in, and if it is attacked only by arguments in, then it is out.
The unique reinstatement labelling that corresponds to the system 
 
 
 
  above is 
 
 
 
 .
Inference from an argumentation system
In the general case when several extensions are computed for a given semantic 
 
 
 
 , the agent that reasons from the system can use several mechanism to infer information:5

Credulous inference: the agent accepts an argument if it belongs to at least one of the 
 
 
 
 -extensions—in which case, the agent risks accepting some arguments that are not acceptable together (
 
 
 
  attacks 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  each belongs to an extension)
Skeptical inference: the agent accepts an argument only if it belongs to every 
 
 
 
 -extension. In this case, the agent risks deducing too little information (if the intersection of the extensions is empty or has a very small cardinal).

For these two methods to infer information, one can identify the set of accepted arguments, respectively 
 
 
 
  the set of the arguments credulously accepted under the semantic 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  the set of arguments accepted skeptically under the semantic 
 
 
 
  (the 
 
 
 
  can be missed if there is no possible ambiguity about the semantic).
Of course, when there is only one extension (for instance, when the system is well-founded), this problem is very simple: the agent accepts arguments of the unique extension and rejects others.
The same reasoning can be done with labellings that correspond to the chosen semantic : an argument can be accepted if it is in for each labelling and refused if it is out for each labelling, the others being in an undecided state (the status of the arguments can remind the epistemic states of a belief in the AGM framework for dynamic of beliefs6).
Equivalence between argumentation frameworks
There exists several criterions of equivalence between argumentation frameworks. Most of those criterions concern the sets of extensions or the set of accepted arguments. Formally, given a semantic 
 
 
 
  :



 
  : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they have the same set of 
 
 
 
 -extensions, that is 
 
 
 
  ;


 
  : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept skeptically the same arguments, that is 
 
 
 
  ;


 
  : two argumentation frameworks are equivalent if they accept credulously the same arguments, that is 
 
 
 
 .

The strong equivalence7 says that two systems 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are equivalent if and only if for all other system 
 
 
 
 , the union of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  is equivalent (for a given criterion) with the union of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .8
Other kind of argumentation frameworks
The abstract framework of Dung has been instantiated to several particular cases.
Logic-based argumentation frameworks
In the case of logic-based argumentation frameworks, an argument is not an abstract entity, but a pair, where the first part is a minimal consistent set of formulae enough to prove the formula for the second part of the argument. Formally, an argument is a pair 
 
 
 
  such that









 
  is a minimal set of 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a set of formulae used by the agent to reason.

One calls 
 
 
 
  a consequence of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  a support of 
 
 
 
 .
In this case, the attack relation is not given in an explicit way, as a subset of the Cartesian product 
 
 
 
 , but as a property that indicates if an argument attacks another. For instance,

Relation defeater

 
  attacks 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 

Relation undercut

 
  attacks 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 

Relation rebuttal

 
  attacks 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a tautology

Given a particular attack relation, one can build a graph and reason in a similar way to the abstract argumentation frameworks (use of semantics to build extension, skeptical or credulous inference), the difference is that the information inferred from a logic based argumentation framework is a set of formulae (the consequences of the accepted arguments).
Value-based argumentation frameworks
The value-based argumentation frameworks come from the idea that during an exchange of arguments, some can be stronger than others with respect to a certain value they advance, and so the success of an attack between arguments depends of the difference of these values.
Formally, a value-based argumentation framework is a tuple 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  similar to the standard framework (a set of arguments and a binary relation on this set), 
 
 
 
  is a non empty set of values, 
 
 
 
  is a mapping that associates each element from 
 
 
 
  to an element from 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a preference relation (transitive, irreflexive and asymmetric) on 
 
 
 
 .
In this framework, an argument 
 
 
 
  defeats another argument 
 
 
 
  if and only if



 
  attacks 
 
 
 
  in the "standard" meaning
 
 
 
  ;
and 
 
 
 
 , that is the value advanced by 
 
 
 
  is not preferred to the one advanced by 
 
 
 
 .

One remarks that an attack succeeds if both arguments are associated to the same value, or if there is no preference between their respective values.
