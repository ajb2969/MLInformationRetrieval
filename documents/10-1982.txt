Lactate aldolase




Lactate aldolase

In enzymology, a lactate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-lactate 
 
 
 
  formate + acetaldehyde
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (S)-lactate, and two products, formate and acetaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-lactate acetaldehyde-lyase (formate-forming). Other names in common use include lactate synthase, and (S)-lactate acetaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism.
