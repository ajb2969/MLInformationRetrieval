   Fresnel–Arago laws      Fresnel–Arago laws   The Fresnel–Arago laws are three laws which summarise some of the more important properties of interference between light of different states of polarization . Augustin-Jean Fresnel and François Arago , both discovered the laws, which bear their name.  The laws are as follows: 1   Two orthogonal , coherent linearly polarized waves cannot interfere.  Two parallel coherent linearly polarized waves will interfere in the same way as natural light .  The two constituent orthogonal linearly polarized states of natural light cannot interfere to form a readily observable interference pattern, even if rotated into alignment (because they are incoherent).   One may understand this more clearly when considering two waves, given by the form      𝐄  𝟏    (  𝐫  ,  t  )    =    𝐄  01    cos   (      𝐤  𝟏   ⋅  𝐫   -   ω  t    +   ϵ  1    )            subscript  𝐄  1    𝐫  t       subscript  𝐄  01          normal-⋅   subscript  𝐤  1   𝐫     ω  t     subscript  ϵ  1        \mathbf{E_{1}}(\mathbf{r},t)=\mathbf{E}_{01}\cos(\mathbf{k_{1}\cdot r}-\omega t%
 +\epsilon_{1})   and      𝐄  𝟐    (  𝐫  ,  t  )    =    𝐄  02    cos   (      𝐤  𝟐   ⋅  𝐫   -   ω  t    +   ϵ  2    )            subscript  𝐄  2    𝐫  t       subscript  𝐄  02          normal-⋅   subscript  𝐤  2   𝐫     ω  t     subscript  ϵ  2        \mathbf{E_{2}}(\mathbf{r},t)=\mathbf{E}_{02}\cos(\mathbf{k_{2}\cdot r}-\omega t%
 +\epsilon_{2})   , where the boldface indicates that the relevant quantity is a vector , interfering. We know that the intensity of light goes as the electric field squared (in fact,    I  =   ϵ  v    ⟨   𝐄  2   ⟩   T        I    ϵ  v   subscript   delimited-⟨⟩   superscript  𝐄  2    T      I=\epsilon v\langle\mathbf{E}^{2}\rangle_{T}   , where the angled brackets denote a time average), and so we just add the fields before squaring them. Extensive algebra 2 yields an interference term in the intensity of the resultant wave, namely:     I  12   =     ϵ  v   𝐄  𝟎𝟏    ⋅   𝐄  𝟎𝟐     cos  δ         subscript  I  12      normal-⋅    ϵ  v   subscript  𝐄  01     subscript  𝐄  02      δ      I_{12}=\epsilon v\mathbf{E_{01}\cdot E_{02}}\cos\delta   , where    δ  =   (       𝐤  𝟏   ⋅  𝐫   -    𝐤  𝟐   ⋅  𝐫    +   ϵ  1    -   ϵ  2    )       δ         normal-⋅   subscript  𝐤  1   𝐫    normal-⋅   subscript  𝐤  2   𝐫     subscript  ϵ  1     subscript  ϵ  2      \delta=(\mathbf{k_{1}\cdot r-k_{2}\cdot r}+\epsilon_{1}-\epsilon_{2})   represents the phase difference arising from a combined path length and initial phase-angle difference.  Now it can be seen that if    𝐄  𝟎𝟏     subscript  𝐄  01    \mathbf{E_{01}}   is perpendicular to    𝐄  𝟎𝟐     subscript  𝐄  02    \mathbf{E_{02}}   (as in the case of the first Fresnel–Arago law),     I  12   =  0       subscript  I  12   0    I_{12}=0   and there is no interference. On the other hand, if    𝐄  𝟎𝟏     subscript  𝐄  01    \mathbf{E_{01}}   is parallel to    𝐄  𝟎𝟐     subscript  𝐄  02    \mathbf{E_{02}}   (as in the case of the second Fresnel–Arago law), the interference term produces a variation in the light intensity corresponding to    cos  δ      δ    \cos\delta   . Finally, if natural light is decomposed into orthogonal linear polarizations (as in the third Fresnel–Arago law), these states are incoherent, meaning that the phase difference   δ   δ   \delta   will be fluctuating so quickly and randomly that after time-averaging we have      ⟨   cos  δ   ⟩   T   =  0       subscript   delimited-⟨⟩    δ    T   0    \langle\cos\delta\rangle_{T}=0   , so again     I  12   =  0       subscript  I  12   0    I_{12}=0   and there is no interference (even if    𝐄  𝟎𝟏     subscript  𝐄  01    \mathbf{E_{01}}   is rotated so that it is parallel to    𝐄  𝟎𝟐     subscript  𝐄  02    \mathbf{E_{02}}   ).
