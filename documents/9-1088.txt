Monodromy theorem

 
In complex analysis, the monodromy theorem is an important result about analytic continuation of a complex-analytic function to a larger set. The idea is that one can extend a complex-analytic function (from here on called simply analytic function) along curves starting in the original domain of the function and ending in the larger set. A potential problem of this analytic continuation along a curve strategy is there are usually many curves which end up at the same point in the larger set. The monodromy theorem gives sufficient conditions for analytic continuation to give the same value at a given point regardless of the curve used to get there, so that the resulting extended analytic function is well-defined and single-valued.
Before stating this theorem it is necessary to define analytic continuation along a curve and study its properties.
Analytic continuation along a curve
The definition of analytic continuation along a curve is a bit technical, but the basic idea is that one starts with an analytic function defined around a point, and one extends that function along a curve via analytic functions defined on small overlapping disks covering that curve.
Formally, consider a curve (a continuous function) 
 
 
 
  Let 
 
 
 
  be an analytic function defined on an open disk

 
  centered at 
 
 
 
 
  An analytic continuation of the pair 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
  is a collection of pairs 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  such that



 
 
  and 
 
 

For each 
 
 

 
  is an open disk centered at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  is an analytic function
For each 
 
 
 
  there exists 
 
 
 
  such that for all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  one has that 
 
 
 
 
  (which implies that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have a non-empty intersection) and the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  coincide on the intersection 
 
 


Properties of analytic continuation along a curve
Analytic continuation along a curve is essentially unique, in the sense that given two analytic continuations 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

 
  of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
 
  the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  coincide on 
 
 
 
  Informally, this says that any two analytic continuations of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
 
  will end up with the same values in a neighborhood of 
 
 

If the curve 
 
 
 
  is closed (that is, 
 
 
 
 ), one need not have 
 
 
 
  equal 
 
 
 
 
  in a neighborhood of 
 
 
 
  For example, if one starts at a point 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and the complex logarithm defined in a neighborhood of this point, and one lets 
 
 
 
  be the circle of radius 
 
 
 
 
  centered at the origin (traveled counterclockwise from 
 
 
 
 ), then by doing an analytic continuation along this curve one will end up with a value of the logarithm at 
 
 
 
  which is 
 
 
 
  plus the original value (see the second illustration on the right).
Monodromy theorem
 As noticed earlier, two analytic continuations along the same curve yield the same result at the curve's endpoint. However, given two different curves branching out from the same point around which an analytic function is defined, with the curves reconnecting at the end, it is not true in general that the analytic continuations of that function along the two curves will yield the same value at their common endpoint.
Indeed, one can consider, as in the previous section, the complex logarithm defined in a neighborhood of a point 
 
 
 
  and the circle centered at the origin and radius 
 
 
 
 
  Then, it is possible to travel from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  in two ways, counterclockwise, on the upper half-plane arc of this circle, and clockwise, on the lower half-plane arc. The values of the logarithm at 
 
 
 
  obtained by analytic continuation along these two arcs will differ by 
 
 

If, however, one can continuously deform one of the curves into another while keeping the starting points and ending points fixed, and analytic continuation is possible on each of the intermediate curves, then the analytic continuations along the two curves will yield the same results at their common endpoint. This is called the monodromy theorem and its statement is made precise below.

Let 
 
 
 
 
  be an open disk in the complex plane centered at a point 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a complex-analytic function. Let 
 
 
 
  be another point in the complex plane. If there exists a family of curves 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  the function 
 
 
 
  is continuous, and for each 
 
 
 
 
  it is possible to do an analytic continuation of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
  then the analytic continuations of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  will yield the same values at 
 
 


The monodromy theorem makes it possible to extend an analytic function to a larger set via curves connecting a point in the original domain of the function to points in the larger set. The theorem below which states that is also called the monodromy theorem.

Let 
 
 
 
  be an open disk in the complex plane centered at a point 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a complex-analytic function. If 
 
 
 
 
  is an open simply-connected set containing 
 
 
 
 , and it is possible to perform an analytic continuation of 
 
 
 
  on any curve contained in 
 
 
 
  which starts at 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 
  admits a direct analytic continuation to 
 
 
 
  meaning that there exists a complex-analytic function 
 
 
 
  whose restriction to 
 
 
 
  is
