Infinitesimal generator (stochastic processes)

In mathematics — specifically, in stochastic analysis — the infinitesimal generator of a stochastic process is a partial differential operator that encodes a great deal of information about the process. The generator is used in evolution equations such as the Kolmogorov backward equation (which describes the evolution of statistics of the process); its L2 Hermitian adjoint is used in evolution equations such as the Fokker–Planck equation (which describes the evolution of the probability density functions of the process).
Definition
Let X : [0, +∞) × Ω → Rn defined on a probability space (Ω, Σ, P) be an Itô diffusion satisfying a stochastic differential equation of the form



where B is an m-dimensional Brownian motion and b : Rn → Rn and σ : Rn → Rn×m are the drift and diffusion fields respectively. For a point x ∈ Rn, let Px denote the law of X given initial datum X0 = x, and let Ex denote expectation with respect to Px.
The infinitesimal generator of X is the operator A, which is defined to act on suitable functions f : Rn → R by



The set of all functions f for which this limit exists at a point x is denoted DA(x), while DA denotes the set of all f for which the limit exists for all x ∈ Rn. One can show that any compactly-supported C2 (twice differentiable with continuous second derivative) function f lies in DA and that
