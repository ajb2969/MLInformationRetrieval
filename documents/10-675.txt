   3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase      3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 3-hydroxypropionate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-hydroxypropanoate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-oxopropanoate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-hydroxypropanoate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 3-oxopropanoate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-hydroxypropanoate:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in beta-alanine metabolism and propanoate metabolism .
