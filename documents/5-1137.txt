Complete set of commuting observables




Complete set of commuting observables

In quantum mechanics, a complete set of commuting observables (CSCO) is a set of commuting operators whose eigenvalues completely specify the state of a system.1
Since each pair of observables in the set commutes, the observables are all compatible so that the measurement of one observable has no effect on the result of measuring another observable in the set. It is therefore not necessary to specify the order in which the different observables are measured. Measurement of the complete set of observables constitutes a complete measurement, in the sense that it projects the quantum state of the system onto a unique and known vector in the basis defined by the set of operators. That is, to prepare the completely specified state, we have to take any state arbitrarily, and then perform a succession of measurements corresponding to all the observables in the set, until it becomes a uniquely specified vector in the Hilbert space.
The Compatibility Theorem
Let us have two observables, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , represented by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then any one of the following statements implies the other two:



 
  and 
 
 
 
  are compatible observables.


 
  and 
 
 
 
  have a common eigenbasis.
The operators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are commuting, that is, 
 
 
 
 .

Proofs






Proof that compatible observables commute.





Let 
 
 
 
  be a complete set of common eigenkets of the two compatible observables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , corresponding to the sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. Then we can write


 
  Now, we can expand any arbitrary state ket 
 
 
 
  in the complete set 
 
 
 
  as


 
  So, using the above result, we can see that


 
  This implies 
 
 
 
 , which means that the two operators commute.











Proof that commuting observables possess a complete set of common eigenfunctions.





''When 
 
 
 
  has non-degenerate eigenvalues:''

Let 
 
 
 
  be a complete set of eigenkets of 
 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the set of eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 . If the operators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  commute, we can write


 
  So, we can say that 
 
 
 
 
  is an eigenket of 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
 . The non-degeneracy of 
 
 
 
  implies that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  can differ at most by a multiplicative constant. We call this constant 
 
 
 
 . So,


 
  So, 
 
 
 
  is eigenket of the operators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
simultaneously.

''When 
 
 
 
  has degenerate eigenvalues:''

We suppose 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  -fold degenerate. Let the corresponding linearly independent eigenkets be 
 
 
 
  Since 
 
 
 
 
 , we reason as above to find that 
 
 
 
  is an eigenket of 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the degenerate eigenvalue 
 
 
 
 . So, we can expand 
 
 
 
  in the basis of the degenerate eigenkets of 
 
 
 
 
 :


 
  The 
 
 
 
  are the expansion coefficients. We now sum over all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  constants 
 
 
 
 
 . So,


 
  So, 
 
 
 
  will be an eigenket of 
 
 
 
  with the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  if we have


 
  This constitutes a system of 
 
 
 
  linear equations for the constants 
 
 
 
 . A non-trivial solution exists if


 
  This is an equation of order 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 
 , and has 
 
 
 
  roots. For each root 
 
 
 
  we have a value of 
 
 
 
 , say, 
 
 
 
 . Now, the ket


 
  is simultaneously an eigenket of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively.





Discussion
We consider the two above observables 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Suppose there exists a complete set of kets 
 
 
 
  whose every element is simultaneously an eigenket of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then we say that 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are compatible. If we denote the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  corresponding to 
 
 
 
  respectively by 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we can write






If the system happens to be in one of the eigenstates, say, 
 
 
 
 , then both 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be simultaneously measured to any arbitrary level of precision, and we will get the results 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively. This idea can be extended to more than two observables.
Examples of Compatible Observables
The Cartesian components of the position operator 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . These components are all compatible. Similarly, the Cartesian components of the momentum operator 
 
 
 
 , that is 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are also compatible.
Formal Definition of a CSCO (Complete Set of Commuting Observables)
A set of observables 
 
 
 
  is called a CSCO if:

All the observables commute in pairs.
If we specify the eigenvalues of all the operators in the CSCO, we identify a unique eigenvector in the Hilbert space of the system.

If we are given a CSCO, we can choose a basis for the space of states made of common eigenvectors of the corresponding operators. We can uniquely identify each eigenvector by the set of eigenvalues it corresponds to.
Discussion
Let us have an operator 
 
 
 
  of an observable 
 
 
 
 , which has all non-degenerate eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 
 . As a result, there is one unique eigenstate corresponding to each eigenvalue, allowing us to label these by their respective eigenvalues. For example, the eigenstate of 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  can be labelled as 
 
 
 
 . Such an observable is itself a self-sufficient CSCO.
However, if some of the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  are degenerate, then the above result no longer holds. In such a case, we need to distinguish between the eigenfunctions corresponding to the same eigenvalue. To do this, a second observable is introduced (let us call that 
 
 
 
 
 ), which is compatible with 
 
 
 
 . The compatibility theorem tells us that a common basis of eigenfunctions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be found. Now if each pair of the eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  uniquely specifies a state vector of this basis, we claim to have formed a CSCO: the set 
 
 
 
 
 . The degeneracy in 
 
 
 
  is completely removed.
It may so happen, nonetheless, that the degeneracy is not completely lifted. That is, there exists at least one pair 
 
 
 
  which does not uniquely identify one eigenvector. In this case, we repeat the above process by adding another observable 
 
 
 
 , which is compatible with both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . If the basis of common eigenfunctions of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is unique, that is, uniquely specified by the set of eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 , then we have formed a CSCO
 
 
 
 . If not, we add one more compatible observable and continue the process till a CSCO is obtained.
The same vector space may have distinct complete sets of commuting operators.
Suppose we are given a finite CSCO 
 
 
 
 . Then we can expand any general state in the Hilbert space as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the eigenkets of the operators 
 
 
 
 , and form a basis space. That is,


 
 , etc
If we measure 
 
 
 
  in the state 
 
 
 
  then the probability that we simultaneously measure 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 .
For a complete set of commuting operators, we can find a unique unitary transformation which will simultaneously diagonalize all of them. If there are more than one such unitary transformations, then we can say that the set is not yet complete.
Examples
The Hydrogenic Atom

Main article: Hydrogen-like Atom.
 

Two components of the angular momentum operator 
 
 
 
 
  do not commute, but satisfy the commutation relations:


 
  So, any CSCO cannot involve more than one component of 
 
 
 
 . It can be shown that the square of the angular momentum operator, 
 
 
 
 , commutes with 
 
 
 
 .


 
  Also, the Hamiltonian

 
  is a function of 
 
 
 
  only and has rotational invariance, where 
 
 
 
  is the reduced mass of the system. Since the components of 
 
 
 
  are generators of rotation, it can be shown that


 
  Therefore a commuting set consists of 
 
 
 
 , one component of 
 
 
 
  (which is taken to be 
 
 
 
 ) and 
 
 
 
 . The solution of the problem tells us that disregarding spin of the electrons, the set 
 
 
 
 
  forms a CSCO. Let 
 
 
 
  be any basis state in the Hilbert space of the hydrogenic atom. Then















That is, the set of eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 
  or more simply, 
 
 
 
  completely specifies a unique eigenstate of the Hydrogenic atom.
The Free Particle
For a free particle, the Hamiltonian is 
 
 
 
  is invariant under translations. Translation commutes with the Hamiltonian
 
 
 
 . However, if we express the Hamiltonian in the basis of the translation operator, we will find that 
 
 
 
  has doubly degenerate eigenvalues. It can be shown that to make the CSCO in this case, we need another operator called the parity operator 
 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 .
 
 
 
  forms a CSCO.
Again, let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the degenerate eigenstates of 
 
 
 
 
 corresponding the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
 , i.e.





 
  The degeneracy in 
 
 
 
  is removed by the momentum operator 
 
 
 
 
 .





 
  So, 
 
 
 
  forms a CSCO.
Addition of Angular Momenta
We consider the case of two systems, 1 and 2, with respective angular momentum operators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . We can write the eigenstates of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
  and of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 .











 
  Then the basis states of the complete system are 
 
 
 
  given by


 
  Therefore, for the complete system, the set of eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  completely specifies a unique basis state, and 
 
 
 
  forms a CSCO. Equivalently, there exists another set of basis states for the system, in terms of the total angular momentum operator 
 
 
 
 
 . The eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  takes on the values 
 
 
 
 , and those of 
 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . The basis states of the operators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
 
 
 . Thus we may also specify a unique basis state in the Hilbert space of the complete system by the set of eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 , and the corresponding CSCO is 
 
 
 
 .
