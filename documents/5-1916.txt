   Normed algebra      Normed algebra   In mathematics, a normed algebra  A refers to an algebra over a field which has a sub-multiplicative norm :          ∀  x   ,  y   ∈  A     ∥   x  y   ∥   ≤    ∥  x  ∥    ∥  y  ∥        formulae-sequence      for-all  x   y   A      norm    x  y       norm  x    norm  y       \forall x,y\in A\qquad\|xy\|\leq\|x\|\|y\|      Optionally, it is sometimes required to have a multiplicative identity 1     A     A    {}_{A}   such as ║1     A     A    {}_{A}   ║ = 1.
