Arruda–Boyce model

In continuum mechanics, an Arruda–Boyce model1 is a hyperelastic constitutive model used to describe the mechanical behavior of rubber and other polymeric substances. This model is based on the statistical mechanics of a material with a cubic representative volume element containing eight chains along the diagonal directions. The material is assumed to be incompressible.
The strain energy density function for the incompressible Arruda–Boyce model is given by2


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of chain segments, 
 
 
 
  is the Boltzmann constant, 
 
 
 
  is the temperature in Kelvin, 
 
 
 
  is the number of chains in the network of a cross-linked polymer,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the first invariant of the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor, and 
 
 
 
  is the inverse Langevin function which can approximated by


 
  For small deformations the Arruda–Boyce model reduces to the Gaussian network based neo-Hookean solid model. It can be shown3 that the Gent model is a simple and accurate approximation of the Arruda–Boyce model.
Alternative expressions for the Arruda–Boyce model
An alternative form of the Arruda–Boyce model, using the first five terms of the inverse Langevin function, is4


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a material constant. The quantity 
 
 
 
  can also be interpreted as a measure of the limiting network stretch.
If 
 
 
 
  is the stretch at which the polymer chain network becomes locked, we can express the Arruda–Boyce strain energy density as


 
  We may alternatively express the Arruda–Boyce model in the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

If the rubber is compressible, a dependence on 
 
 
 
  can be introduced into the strain energy density; 
 
 
 
  being the deformation gradient. Several possibilities exist, among which the Kaliske–Rothert5 extension has been found to be reasonably accurate. With that extension, the Arruda-Boyce strain energy density function can be expressed as


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a material constant and 
 
 
 
  . For consistency with linear elasticity, we must have 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the bulk modulus.
Consistency condition
For the incompressible Arruda–Boyce model to be consistent with linear elasticity, with 
 
 
 
  as the shear modulus of the material, the following condition has to be satisfied:


 
  From the Arruda–Boyce strain energy density function, we have,


 
  Therefore, at 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  Substituting in the values of 
 
 
 
  leads to the consistency condition



Stress-deformation relations
The Cauchy stress for the incompressible Arruda–Boyce model is given by



Uniaxial extension
 For uniaxial extension in the 
 
 
 
 -direction, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
 
  If 
 
 
 
 , we have


 
  Therefore,


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Equibiaxial extension
For equibiaxial extension in the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  directions, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Planar extension
Planar extension tests are carried out on thin specimens which are constrained from deforming in one direction. For planar extension in the 
 
 
 
  directions with the 
 
 
 
  direction constrained, the principal stretches are 
 
 
 
 . From incompressibility 
 
 
 
 . Hence 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,


 
  The left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor can then be expressed as


 
  If the directions of the principal stretches are oriented with the coordinate basis vectors, we have


 
  The engineering strain is 
 
 
 
 . The engineering stress is



Simple shear
The deformation gradient for a simple shear deformation has the form6


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are reference orthonormal basis vectors in the plane of deformation and the shear deformation is given by


 
  In matrix form, the deformation gradient and the left Cauchy–Green deformation tensor may then be expressed as


 
  Therefore,


 
  and the Cauchy stress is given by



Statistical mechanics of polymer deformation
The Arruda–Boyce model is based on the statistical mechanics of polymer chains. In this approach, each macromolecule is described as a chain of 
 
 
 
  segments, each of length 
 
 
 
 . If we assume that the initial configuration of a chain can be described by a random walk, then the initial chain length is


 
  If we assume that one end of the chain is at the origin, then the probability that a block of size 
 
 
 
 
  around the origin will contain the other end of the chain, 
 
 
 
 , assuming a Gaussian probability density function, is


 
  The configurational entropy of a single chain from Boltzmann statistical mechanics is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a constant. The total entropy in a network of 
 
 
 
 
  chains is therefore


 
  where an affine deformation has been assumed. Therefore the strain energy of the deformed network is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the temperature.
