   Primordial element (algebra)      Primordial element (algebra)   In algebra , a primordial element is a particular kind of a vector in a vector space . Let V be a vector space over a field  k and fix a basis for V of vectors    e  i     subscript  e  i    e_{i}   for    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   . By the definition of a basis, every vector v in V can be expressed uniquely as       v  =    ∑   i  ∈  I      a  i    (  v  )    e  i      .      v    subscript     i  I       subscript  a  i   v   subscript  e  i       v=\sum_{i\in I}a_{i}(v)e_{i}.   Define     I   (  v  )    =   {   i  ∈  I   ∣     a  i    (  v  )    ≠  0   }         I  v    conditional-set    i  I        subscript  a  i   v   0      I(v)=\{i\in I\mid a_{i}(v)\neq 0\}   , the set of indices for which the expression of v has a nonzero coefficient. Given a subspace W of V , a nonzero vector w in W is said to be "primordial" if it has the following two properties: 1       I   (  w  )       I  w    I(w)   is minimal among the sets    I   (   w  ′   )       I   superscript  w  normal-′     I(w^{\prime})   ,    0  ≠   w  ′   ∈  W        0   superscript  w  normal-′        W     0\neq w^{\prime}\in W   and        a  i    (  w  )    =  1         subscript  a  i   w   1    a_{i}(w)=1   for some i .
