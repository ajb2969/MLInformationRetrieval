Primordial element (algebra)

In algebra, a primordial element is a particular kind of a vector in a vector space. Let V be a vector space over a field k and fix a basis for V of vectors 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . By the definition of a basis, every vector v in V can be expressed uniquely as


 
  Define 
 
 
 
 
 , the set of indices for which the expression of v has a nonzero coefficient. Given a subspace W of V, a nonzero vector w in W is said to be "primordial" if it has the following two properties:1



 
  is minimal among the sets 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and


 
  for some i.
