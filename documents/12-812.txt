Nielsen–Schreier theorem

In group theory, a branch of mathematics, the Nielsen–Schreier theorem states that every subgroup of a free group is itself free.123 It is named after Jakob Nielsen and Otto Schreier.
Statement of the theorem
A free group may be defined from a group presentation consisting of a set of generators and the empty set of relations (equations that the generators satisfy). That is, it is the unique group in which every element is a product of some sequence of generators and their inverses, and in which there are no equations between group elements that do not follow in a trivial way from the equations  describing the relation between a generator and its inverse. The elements of a free group may be described as all of the possible reduced words; these are strings of generators and their inverses, in which no generator is adjacent to its own inverse. Two reduced words may be multiplied by concatenating them and then removing any generator-inverse pairs that result from the concatenation.
The Nielsen–Schreier theorem states that if 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of a free group, then 
 
 
 
  is itself isomorphic to a free group. That is, there exists a subset 
 
 
 
  of elements of 
 
 
 
  such that every element in 
 
 
 
  is a product of members of 
 
 
 
  and their inverses, and such that 
 
 
 
  satisfies no nontrivial relations.
The Nielsen–Schreier formula, or Schreier index formula, quantifies the result: if 
 
 
 
  is a free group on 
 
 
 
  generators, and 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of index

 
  then 
 
 
 
  is free of rank4



Example
Let 
 
 
 
  be the free group with two generators, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be the subgroup consisting of all reduced words that are products of evenly many generators or their inverses. Then 
 
 
 
  is itself generated by the six elements 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , , 
 
 
 
 , , and 
 
 
 
 . A factorization of any reduced word in 
 
 
 
  into these generators and their inverses may be constructed simply by taking consecutive pairs of symbols in the reduced word. However, this is not a free presentation of 
 
 
 
  because it satisfies the relations  and . Instead, 
 
 
 
  is generated as a free group by the three elements 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Any factorization of a word into a product of generators from the six-element generating set } can be transformed into a product of generators from this smaller set by replacing 
 
 
 
  with , replacing 
 
 
 
  with , and replacing 
 
 
 
  with . There are no additional relations satisfied by these three generators, so 
 
 
 
  is the free group generated by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .5 The Nielsen–Schreier theorem states that this example is not a coincidence: like 
 
 
 
 , every subgroup of a free group can be generated as a free group, possibly with a larger set of generators.
Proof
It is possible to prove the Nielsen–Scheier theorem using topology.6 A free group 
 
 
 
  on a set of generators is the fundamental group of a bouquet of circles, a topological graph with a single vertex and with an edge for each generator.7 Any subgroup 
 
 
 
  of the fundamental group is itself a fundamental group of a covering space of the bouquet, a (possibly infinite) topological Schreier coset graph that has one vertex for each coset of the subgroup.8 And in any topological graph, it is possible to shrink the edges of a spanning tree of the graph, producing a bouquet of circles that has the same fundamental group 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is the fundamental group of a bouquet of circles, it is itself free.9 This proof is due to ; the original proof by Schreier forms the Schreier graph in a different way as a quotient of the Cayley graph of 
 
 
 
  modulo the action of 
 
 
 
 .
According to Schreier's subgroup lemma, a set of generators for a free presentation of 
 
 
 
  may be constructed from cycles in the covering graph formed by concatenating a spanning tree path from a base point (the coset of the identity) to one of the cosets, a single non-tree edge, and an inverse spanning tree path from the other endpoint of the edge back to the base point.10
Axiomatic foundations
Although several different proofs of the Nielsen–Schreier theorem are known, they all depend on the axiom of choice. In the proof based on fundamental groups of bouquets, for instance, the axiom of choice appears in the guise of the statement that every connected graph has a spanning tree. The use of this axiom is necessary, as there exist models of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory in which the axiom of choice and the Nielsen–Schreier theorem are both false. The Nielsen–Schreier theorem in turn implies a weaker version of the axiom of choice, for finite sets.11
History
The Nielsen–Schreier theorem is a non-abelian analogue of an older result of Richard Dedekind, that every subgroup of a free abelian group is free abelian.12  originally proved a restricted form of the theorem, stating that any finitely-generated subgroup of a free group is free. His proof involves performing a sequence of Nielsen transformations on the subgroup's generating set that reduce their length (as reduced words in the free group from which they are drawn).1314 Otto Schreier proved the Nielsen–Schreier theorem in its full generality in his 1926 habilitation thesis, Die Untergruppen der freien Gruppe, also published in 1927 in Abh. math. Sem. Hamburg. Univ.1516
The topological proof based on fundamental groups of bouquets of circles is due to . Another topological proof, based on the Bass–Serre theory of group actions on trees, was published by .17
