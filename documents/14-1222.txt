   Binomial ring      Binomial ring   In mathematics, a binomial ring is a ring whose additive group is torsion-free that contains all binomial coefficients       (     x      n     )   =    x   (   x  -  1   )   ⋯   (    x  -  n   +  1   )     n  !         binomial  x  n       x    x  1   normal-⋯      x  n   1      n      {\left({{x}\atop{n}}\right)}=\frac{x(x-1)\cdots(x-n+1)}{n!}     for x in the ring and n a positive integer. Binomial rings were introduced by .  showed that binomial rings are essentially the same as λ-rings such that all Adams operations are the identity.  References       "  Category:Ring theory
