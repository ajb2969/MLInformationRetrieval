List of Los Angeles Clippers seasons

 The Los Angeles Clippers are a professional basketball team based in Los Angeles, California, United States. They play in the National Basketball Association (NBA) and are a member of the NBA Western Conference's Pacific Division. The Clippers were founded in 1970 as the Buffalo Braves. They were one of three franchises that joined the NBA in the 1970–71 season. The Braves moved to San Diego, California after the 1977–78 season, and became known as the San Diego Clippers.1 For the 1984–85 NBA season, the Clippers moved north to Los Angeles and became known as the Los Angeles Clippers.
On October 14, 1970, the Braves beat the Cleveland Cavaliers 107–92 in their first game.2 In the 1972 NBA Draft, the Braves selected Bob McAdoo,3 who later won such awards as Rookie of the Year and Most Valuable Player.4 During McAdoo's years (1972–76) with the franchise,5 the Braves reached the post-season three times and had a record of nine wins and 13 losses during that time.
Overall, the Clippers have qualified for the post-season eleven times; most recently in the 2014–15 season. Unfortunately, they passed the first round of the playoffs only five times (1975–76, 2005–06, 2011–12, 2013-14 and 2014-15). Additionally, the Clippers have never won league or Conference titles, let alone play in either title game in their 45-year history, and the 30-year drought between winning a playoffs round is the longest in league history.6 They also have only eleven seasons with a winning percentage of .500 or better, and as a result, in their April 17, 2000 issue, the Sports Illustrated had three Clippers fans on the cover that stated "The worst franchise in sports history".7 However, with the additions of Blake Griffin and Chris Paul, they have made steady progress as a title contender in recent years. They got their first division title in the 2012-13 season, their 43rd year in the league, and repeated the following year.8 Overall, their winning percentage through the years is .389, with 1416 wins and 2226 losses.
