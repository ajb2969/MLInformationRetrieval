Tait equation

In fluid mechanics, the Tait equation is an equation of state, used to relate liquid density to pressure. The equation was originally published by Peter Guthrie Tait in 1888.1 It is sometimes written as



or in the integrated form



where



 
  is the compressibility of the substance (often,  water) (in units of barâˆ’1)


 
  is the specific volume of the substance (in units of ml/g)


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are functions of temperature that are independent of pressure2
