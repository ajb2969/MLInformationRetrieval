   Psi (letter)      Psi (letter)   (Figure)  The Greek alphabet on a black-figure pottery vessel, with an archaic chickenfoot-shaped psi.   Psi (uppercase , lowercase ; Psi ) is the 23rd letter of the Greek alphabet and has a numeric value of 700. In both Classical and Modern Greek , the letter indicates the combination /ps/ (as in English word "lapse").  For Greek loanwords in Latin and modern languages with Latin alphabets, psi is usually transliterated as "ps". In English, the letter is pronounced  or sometimes . (In Greek, it is pronounced .)  The letter's origin is uncertain. It may or may not derive from the Phoenician alphabet . It appears in the 7th century BC, expressing /ps/ in the Eastern alphabets, but /kʰ/ in the Western alphabets (the sound expressed by Χ in the Eastern alphabets). In writing, the early letter appears in an angular shape (). There were early graphical variants that omitted the stem ("chickenfoot-shaped psi" as:  or ).  The Western letter (expressing /kʰ/, later /x/) was adopted into the Old Italic alphabets , and its shape is also continued into the Algiz rune of the Elder Futhark . The classical Greek letter was adopted into the early Cyrillic alphabet as " ".  Use as a symbol  The letter psi is commonly used in physics to represent wave functions in quantum mechanics , such as in the Schrödinger equation and bra–ket notation     ⟨  ϕ  |  ψ  ⟩     inner-product  ϕ  ψ    \langle\phi|\psi\rangle   . It is also used to represent the (generalized) positional states of a qubit in a quantum computer .  Psi is also used as the symbol for the polygamma function , defined by        ψ   (  m  )     (  z  )    =     d  m    d   z  m        Γ  ′    (  z  )     Γ   (  z  )             superscript  ψ  m   z        superscript  d  m     d   superscript  z  m          superscript  normal-Γ  normal-′   z     normal-Γ  z       \psi^{(m)}(z)=\frac{d^{m}}{dz^{m}}\frac{\Gamma^{\prime}(z)}{\Gamma(z)}   where    Γ   (  z  )       normal-Γ  z    \Gamma(z)   is the gamma function .  The letters Ψ or ψ can also be a symbol for:   psychology , psychiatry , and sometimes parapsychology (involving paranormal or relating with the supernatural subjects, especially research into extrasensory perception).  In mathematics, the reciprocal Fibonacci constant .  Water potential in movement of water between plant cells.  In biochemistry , it denotes the rare nucleotide  pseudouridilic acid .

In the computability theory ,     ψ  P    (  x  )        subscript  ψ  P   x    \psi_{P}(x)\,\!   represents the return value   Y   Y   Y\,\!   of a program   P   P   P\,\!   .  In circadian physiology , ψ represents the phase relationship between a zeitgeber and a biological rhythm .
