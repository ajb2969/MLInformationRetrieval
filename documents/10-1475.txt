Glutamate synthase (NADH)

In enzymology, a glutamate synthase (NADH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 L-glutamate + NAD+

 
  L-glutamine + 2-oxoglutarate + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamate and NAD+, whereas its 4 products are L-glutamine, 2-oxoglutarate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and nitrogen assimilation. It employs one cofactor, FMN.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (transaminating). Other names in common use include:

glutamate (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide) synthase,
glutamate synthase (NADH),
L-glutamate synthetase(NADH),
NADH-dependent glutamate synthase,
NADH-glutamate synthase, and
NADH-Glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (NADH-GOGAT).
