Rogers polynomials

In mathematics, the Rogers polynomials, also called Rogers–Askey–Ismail polynomials and continuous q-ultraspherical polynomials, are a family of orthogonal polynomials introduced by  in the course of his work on the Rogers–Ramanujan identities. They are q-analogs of ultraspherical polynomials, and are the Macdonald polynomials for the special case of the A1 affine root system .
and  discuss the properties of Rogers polynomials in detail.
Definition
The Rogers polynomials can be defined in terms of the descending Pochhammer symbol and the basic hypergeometric series by


 
  where x = cos(θ).
