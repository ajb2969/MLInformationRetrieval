Uniform integrability

Uniform integrability is an important concept in real analysis, functional analysis and measure theory, and plays a vital role in the theory of martingales.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a positive measure space. A set 
 
 
 
  is called uniformly integrable if to each 
 
 
 
  there corresponds a 
 
 
 
  such that



whenever 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Formal definition
The following definition applies.1

A class 
 
 
 
  of random variables is called uniformly integrable (UI) if given 
 
 
 
 , there exists 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the indicator function

 
 .


An alternative definition involving two clauses may be presented as follows: A class 
 
 
 
  of random variables is called uniformly integrable if:
 
There exists a finite 
 
 
 
  such that, for every 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
For every 
 
 
 
  there exists 
 
 
 
  such that, for every measurable 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and every 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .

The following results apply.

Definition 1 could be rewritten by taking the limits as










A non-UI sequence. Let 
 
 
 
 , and define







 n, & \omega\in (0,1/n), \\
 0 , & \text{otherwise.} \end{cases}

Clearly 
 
 
 
 , and indeed 
 
 
 
  for all n. However,
 
 



and comparing with definition 1, it is seen that the sequence is not uniformly integrable.

By using Definition 2 in the above example, it can be seen that the first clause is satisfied as 
 
 
 
  norm of all 
 
 
 
 s are 1 i.e., bounded. But the second clause does not hold as given any 
 
 
 
  positive, there is an interval 
 
 
 
  with measure less than 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a UI random variable, by splitting






and bounding each of the two, it can be seen that a uniformly integrable random variable is always bounded in 
 
 
 
 .
 


If any sequence of random variables 
 
 
 
  is dominated by an integrable, non-negative 
 
 
 
 : that is, for all ω and n,








then the class 
 
 
 
  of random variables 
 
 
 
  is uniformly integrable.
 


A class of random variables bounded in 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
 ) is uniformly integrable.

Relation to convergence of random variables

A sequence 
 
 
 
  converges to 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
 
  norm if and only if it converges in measure to 
 
 
 
  and it is uniformly integrable. In probability terms, a sequence of random variables converging in probability also converge in the mean if and only if they are uniformly integrable.4 This is a generalization of the dominated convergence theorem.
