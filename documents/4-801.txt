   Representable functor      Representable functor   In mathematics , particularly category theory , a representable functor is a functor of a special form from an arbitrary category into the category of sets . Such functors give representations of an abstract category in terms of known structures (i.e. sets and functions ) allowing one to utilize, as much as possible, knowledge about the category of sets in other settings.  From another point of view, representable functors for a category C are the functors given with C . Their theory is a vast generalisation of upper sets in posets , and of Cayley's theorem in group theory .  Definition  Let C be a locally small category and let Set be the category of sets . For each object A of C let Hom( A ,‚Äì) be the hom functor that maps objects X to the set Hom( A , X ).  A functor  F : C ‚Üí Set is said to be representable if it is naturally isomorphic to Hom( A ,‚Äì) for some object A of C . A representation of F is a pair ( A , Œ¶) where   Œ¶ : Hom( A ,‚Äì) ‚Üí F    is a natural isomorphism.  A contravariant functor  G from C to Set is the same thing as a functor G : C op ‚Üí Set and is commonly called a presheaf . A presheaf is representable when it is naturally isomorphic to the contravariant hom-functor Hom(‚Äì, A ) for some object A of C .  Universal elements  According to Yoneda's lemma , natural transformations from Hom( A ,‚Äì) to F are in one-to-one correspondence with the elements of F ( A ). Given a natural transformation Œ¶ : Hom( A ,‚Äì) ‚Üí F the corresponding element u ‚àà F ( A ) is given by       u  =    Œ¶  A    (   id  A   )     .      u     subscript  normal-Œ¶  A    subscript  id  A      u=\Phi_{A}(\mathrm{id}_{A}).\,   Conversely, given any element u ‚àà F ( A ) we may define a natural transformation Œ¶ : Hom( A ,‚Äì) ‚Üí F via        Œ¶  X    (  f  )    =    (   F  f   )    (  u  )           subscript  normal-Œ¶  X   f       F  f   u     \Phi_{X}(f)=(Ff)(u)\,   where f is an element of Hom( A , X ). In order to get a representation of F we want to know when the natural transformation induced by u is an isomorphism. This leads to the following definition:   A universal element of a functor F : C ‚Üí Set is a pair ( A , u ) consisting of an object A of C and an element u ‚àà F ( A ) such that for every pair ( X , v ) with v ‚àà F ( X ) there exists a unique morphism f : A ‚Üí X such that ( Ff ) u = v .   A universal element may be viewed as a universal morphism from the one-point set {‚Ä¢} to the functor F or as an initial object in the category of elements of F .  The natural transformation induced by an element u ‚àà F ( A ) is an isomorphism if and only if ( A , u ) is a universal element of F . We therefore conclude that representations of F are in one-to-one correspondence with universal elements of F . For this reason, it is common to refer to universal elements ( A , u ) as representations.  Examples   Consider the contravariant functor P : Set ‚Üí Set which maps each set to its power set and each function to its inverse image map. To represent this functor we need a pair ( A , u ) where A is a set and u is a subset of A , i.e. an element of P ( A ), such that for all sets X , the hom-set Hom( X , A ) is isomorphic to P ( X ) via Œ¶ X ( f ) = ( Pf ) u = f ‚àí1 ( u ). Take A = {0,1} and u = {1}. Given a subset S ‚äÜ X the corresponding function from X to A is the characteristic function of S .  Forgetful functors to Set are very often representable. In particular, a forgetful functor is represented by ( A , u ) whenever A is a free object over a singleton set with generator u .  The forgetful functor Grp ‚Üí Set on the category of groups is represented by ( Z , 1).  The forgetful functor Ring ‚Üí Set on the category of rings is represented by ( Z [ x ], x ), the polynomial ring in one variable with integer  coefficients .  The forgetful functor Vect ‚Üí Set on the category of real vector spaces is represented by ( R , 1).  The forgetful functor Top ‚Üí Set on the category of topological spaces is represented by any singleton topological space with its unique element.   A group  G can be considered a category (even a groupoid ) with one object which we denote by ‚Ä¢. A functor from G to Set then corresponds to a G -set . The unique hom-functor Hom(‚Ä¢,‚Äì) from G to Set corresponds to the canonical G -set G with the action of left multiplication. Standard arguments from group theory show that a functor from G to Set is representable if and only if the corresponding G -set is simply transitive (i.e. a G -torsor or heap ). Choosing a representation amounts to choosing an identity for the heap.  Let C be the category of CW-complexes with morphisms given by homotopy classes of continuous functions. For each natural number n there is a contravariant functor H n : C ‚Üí Ab which assigns each CW-complex its n th  cohomology group (with integer coefficients). Composing this with the forgetful functor we have a contravariant functor from C to Set . Brown's representability theorem in algebraic topology says that this functor is represented by a CW-complex K ( Z , n ) called an Eilenberg‚ÄìMac Lane space .   Properties  Uniqueness  Representations of functors are unique up to a unique isomorphism. That is, if ( A 1 ,Œ¶ 1 ) and ( A 2 ,Œ¶ 2 ) represent the same functor, then there exists a unique isomorphism œÜ : A 1 ‚Üí A 2 such that        Œ¶  1   -  1    ‚àò   Œ¶  2    =   Hom   (  œÜ  ,  -  )           superscript   subscript  normal-Œ¶  1     1     subscript  normal-Œ¶  2      Hom   œÜ       \Phi_{1}^{-1}\circ\Phi_{2}=\mathrm{Hom}(\varphi,-)   as natural isomorphisms from Hom( A 2 ,‚Äì) to Hom( A 1 ,‚Äì). This fact follows easily from Yoneda's lemma .  Stated in terms of universal elements: if ( A 1 , u 1 ) and ( A 2 , u 2 ) represent the same functor, then there exists a unique isomorphism œÜ : A 1 ‚Üí A 2 such that         (   F  œÜ   )    u  1    =   u  2    .          F  œÜ    subscript  u  1     subscript  u  2     (F\varphi)u_{1}=u_{2}.     Preservation of limits  Representable functors are naturally isomorphic to Hom functors and therefore share their properties. In particular, (covariant) representable functors preserve all limits . It follows that any functor which fails to preserve some limit is not representable.  Contravariant representable functors take colimits to limits.  Left adjoint  Any functor K : C ‚Üí Set with a left adjoint  F : Set ‚Üí C is represented by ( FX , Œ∑ X (‚Ä¢)) where X = {‚Ä¢} is a singleton set and Œ∑ is the unit of the adjunction.  Conversely, if K is represented by a pair ( A , u ) and all small copowers of A exist in C then K has a left adjoint F which sends each set I to the I th copower of A .  Therefore, if C is a category with all small copowers, a functor K : C ‚Üí Set is representable if and only if it has a left adjoint.  Relation to universal morphisms and adjoints  The categorical notions of universal morphisms and adjoint functors can both be expressed using representable functors.  Let G : D ‚Üí C be a functor and let X be an object of C . Then ( A ,œÜ) is a universal morphism from X to G  if and only if ( A ,œÜ) is a representation of the functor Hom C ( X , G ‚Äì) from D to Set . It follows that G has a left-adjoint F if and only if Hom C ( X , G ‚Äì) is representable for all X in C . The natural isomorphism Œ¶ X : Hom D ( FX ,‚Äì) ‚Üí Hom C ( X , G ‚Äì) yields the adjointness; that is       Œ¶   X  ,  Y    :     Hom  ùíü    (   F  X   ,  Y  )    ‚Üí    Hom  ùíû    (  X  ,   G  Y   )        normal-:   subscript  normal-Œ¶   X  Y     normal-‚Üí     subscript  Hom  ùíü      F  X   Y       subscript  Hom  ùíû    X    G  Y        \Phi_{X,Y}\colon\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{D}}(FX,Y)\to\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(%
 X,GY)   is a bijection for all X and Y .  The dual statements are also true. Let F : C ‚Üí D be a functor and let Y be an object of D . Then ( A ,œÜ) is a universal morphism from F to Y if and only if ( A ,œÜ) is a representation of the functor Hom D ( F ‚Äì, Y ) from C to Set . It follows that F has a right-adjoint G if and only if Hom D ( F ‚Äì, Y ) is representable for all Y in D .  See also   Subobject classifier   References     "
