   Wreath product      Wreath product   In mathematics , the wreath product of group theory is a specialized product of two groups, based on a semidirect product . Wreath products are used in the classification of permutation groups and also provide a way of constructing interesting examples of groups.  Given two groups A and H , there exist two variations of the wreath product: the unrestricted wreath product  A Wr H (also written A ≀ H ) and the restricted wreath product  A wr H . Given a set Ω with an H -action there exists a generalisation of the wreath product which is denoted by A Wr Ω  H or A wr Ω  H respectively.  The notion generalizes to semigroups and is a central construction in the Krohn-Rhodes structure theory of finite semigroups.  Definition  Let A and H be groups and Ω a set with H  acting on it. Let K be the direct product      K  ≡    ∏    ω   ∈  Ω     A  ω        K    subscript  product    ω  normal-Ω     subscript  A  ω      K\equiv\prod_{\omega\,\in\,\Omega}A_{\omega}     of copies of A ω := A indexed by the set Ω. The elements of K can be seen as arbitrary sequences ( a ω ) of elements of A indexed by Ω with component wise multiplication. Then the action of H on Ω extends in a natural way to an action of H on the group K by       h   (   a  ω   )    ≡   (   a    h   -  1    ω    )         h   subscript  a  ω     subscript  a     superscript  h    1    ω      h(a_{\omega})\equiv(a_{h^{-1}\omega})   .  Then the unrestricted wreath product  A Wr Ω  H of A by H is the semidirect product  K ⋊ H . The subgroup K of A Wr Ω  H is called the base of the wreath product.  The restricted wreath product  A wr Ω  H is constructed in the same way as the unrestricted wreath product except that one uses the direct sum      K  ≡    ⊕    ω   ∈  Ω     A  ω        K    subscript  direct-sum    ω  normal-Ω     subscript  A  ω      K\equiv\bigoplus_{\omega\,\in\,\Omega}A_{\omega}     as the base of the wreath product. In this case the elements of K are sequences ( a ω ) of elements in A indexed by Ω of which all but finitely many a ω are the identity element of A .  In the most common case, one takes Ω := H , where H  acts in a natural way on itself by left multiplication. In this case, the unrestricted and restricted wreath product may be denoted by A Wr H and A wr H respectively. This is called the regular wreath product.  Notation and conventions  The structure of the wreath product of A by H depends on the H -set Ω and in case Ω is infinite it also depends on whether one uses the restricted or unrestricted wreath product. However, in literature the notation used may be deficient and one needs to pay attention on the circumstances.   In literature A ≀ Ω H may stand for the unrestricted wreath product A Wr Ω  H or the restricted wreath product A wr Ω  H .    Similarly, A ≀ H may stand for the unrestricted regular wreath product A Wr H or the restricted regular wreath product A wr H .    In literature the H -set Ω may be omitted from the notation even if Ω≠H.    In the special case that H = S n is the symmetric group of degree n it is common in the literature to assume that Ω={1,..., n } (with the natural action of S n ) and then omit Ω from the notation. That is, A ≀ S n commonly denotes A ≀ {1,..., n } S n instead of the regular wreath product A ≀ S n S n . In the first case the base group is the product of n copies of A , in the latter it is the product of n ! copies of A .   Properties   Since the finite direct product is the same as the finite direct sum of groups, it follows that the unrestricted A Wr Ω  H and the restricted wreath product A wr Ω  H agree if the H -set Ω is finite. In particular this is true when Ω = H is finite.    A wr Ω  H is always a subgroup of A Wr Ω  H .    Universal Embedding Theorem: If G is an extension of A by H , then there exists a subgroup of the unrestricted wreath product A ≀ H which is isomorphic to G . 1 This is also known as the Krasner-Kaloujnine embedding theorem . The Krohn-Rhodes theorem involves what is basically the semigroup equivalent of this. 2    If A , H and Ω are finite, then     | A ≀ Ω H | = | A | |Ω| | H |. 3      Canonical actions of wreath products  If the group A acts on a set Λ then there are two canonical ways to construct sets from Ω and Λ on which A Wr Ω  H (and therefore also A wr Ω  H ) can act.   The imprimitive wreath product action on Λ×Ω.    If (( a ω ), h )∈ A Wr Ω  H and (λ,ω')∈Λ×Ω, then           (   (   a  ω   )   ,  h  )   ⋅   (  λ  ,   ω  ′   )    :=   (    a   h   (   ω  ′   )     λ   ,   h   ω  ′    )      assign   normal-⋅    subscript  a  ω   h    λ   superscript  ω  normal-′         subscript  a    h   superscript  ω  normal-′     λ     h   superscript  ω  normal-′       ((a_{\omega}),h)\cdot(\lambda,\omega^{\prime}):=(a_{h(\omega^{\prime})}\lambda%
 ,h\omega^{\prime})   .      The primitive wreath product action on Λ Ω .    An element in Λ Ω is a sequence (λ ω ) indexed by the H -set Ω. Given an element (( a ω ), h ) ∈ A Wr Ω  H its operation on (λ ω )∈Λ Ω is given by           (   (   a  ω   )   ,  h  )   ⋅   (   λ  ω   )    :=   (    a    h   -  1    ω     λ    h   -  1    ω     )      assign   normal-⋅    subscript  a  ω   h    subscript  λ  ω       subscript  a     superscript  h    1    ω     subscript  λ     superscript  h    1    ω       ((a_{\omega}),h)\cdot(\lambda_{\omega}):=(a_{h^{-1}\omega}\lambda_{h^{-1}%
 \omega})   .     Examples   The Lamplighter group is the restricted wreath product ℤ 2 ≀ℤ.    ℤ m ≀ S n ( Generalized symmetric group ).    The base of this wreath product is the n -fold direct product     ℤ m n = ℤ m × ... × ℤ m       of copies of ℤ m where the action φ : S n → Aut(ℤ m n ) of the symmetric group  S n of degree n is given by     φ(σ)(α 1 ,..., α n ) := (α σ(1) ,..., α σ( n ) ). 4       S 2 ≀ S n ( Hyperoctahedral group ).    The action of S n on {1,..., n } is as above. Since the symmetric group S 2 of degree 2 is isomorphic to ℤ 2 the hyperoctahedral group is a special case of a generalized symmetric group. 5     The smallest non-trivial wreath product is ℤ 2 ≀ℤ 2 , which is the two-dimensional case of the above hyperoctahedral group. It is the symmetry group of the square, also called Dih 4 , the dihedral group of order 8.    Let p be a prime and let n ≥1. Let P be a Sylow p -subgroup of the symmetric group S p n of degree p n . Then P is isomorphic to the iterated regular wreath product W n = ℤ p ≀ ℤ p ≀...≀ℤ p of n copies of ℤ p . Here W 1 := ℤ p and W k := W k -1 ≀ℤ p for all k ≥2. 6 7 For instance, the Sylow 2-subgroup of S 4 is the above ℤ 2 ≀ℤ 2 group.    The Rubik's Cube group is a subgroup of index 12 in the product of wreath products, (ℤ 3 ≀ S 8 ) × (ℤ 2 ≀ S 12 ), the factors corresponding to the symmetries of the 8 corners and 12 edges.
