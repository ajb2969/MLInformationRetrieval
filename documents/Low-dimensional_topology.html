<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, <strong>low-dimensional topology</strong> is the branch of <a class="uri" href="topology" title="wikilink">topology</a> that studies <a href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifolds</a> of four or fewer <a href="dimension" title="wikilink">dimensions</a>. Representative topics are the structure theory of <a href="3-manifold" title="wikilink">3-manifolds</a> and 4-manifolds, <a href="knot_theory" title="wikilink">knot theory</a>, and <a href="braid_group" title="wikilink">braid groups</a>. It can be regarded as a part of <a href="geometric_topology" title="wikilink">geometric topology</a>.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>

<p>A number of advances starting in the 1960s had the effect of emphasising low dimensions in topology. The solution by <a class="uri" href="Smale" title="wikilink">Smale</a>, in 1961, of the <a href="Poincaré_conjecture" title="wikilink">Poincaré conjecture</a> in higher dimensions made dimensions three and four seem the hardest; and indeed they required new methods, while the freedom of higher dimensions meant that questions could be reduced to computational methods available in <a href="surgery_theory" title="wikilink">surgery theory</a>. <a href="William_Thurston" title="wikilink">Thurston's</a> <a href="geometrization_conjecture" title="wikilink">geometrization conjecture</a>, formulated in the late 1970s, offered a framework that suggested geometry and topology were closely intertwined in low dimensions, and Thurston's proof of geometrization for <a href="Haken_manifold" title="wikilink">Haken manifolds</a> utilized a variety of tools from previously only weakly linked areas of mathematics. <a href="Vaughan_Jones" title="wikilink">Vaughan Jones</a>' discovery of the <a href="Jones_polynomial" title="wikilink">Jones polynomial</a> in the early 1980s not only led knot theory in new directions but gave rise to still mysterious connections between low-dimensional topology and mathematical physics. In 2002 <a href="Grigori_Perelman" title="wikilink">Grigori Perelman</a> announced a proof of the three-dimensional Poincaré conjecture, using <a href="Richard_Hamilton_(professor)" title="wikilink">Richard Hamilton</a>'s <a href="Ricci_flow" title="wikilink">Ricci flow</a>, an idea belonging to the field of <a href="geometric_analysis" title="wikilink">geometric analysis</a>.</p>

<p>Overall, this progress has led to better integration of the field into the rest of mathematics.</p>
<h2 id="two-dimensions">Two dimensions</h2>

<p>A <a class="uri" href="surface" title="wikilink">surface</a> is a <a class="uri" href="two-dimensional" title="wikilink">two-dimensional</a>, <a href="topological_manifold" title="wikilink">topological manifold</a>. The most familiar examples are those that arise as the boundaries of solid objects in ordinary three-dimensional <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a> <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup> — for example, the surface of a <a href="ball_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">ball</a>. On the other hand, there are surfaces, such as the <a href="Klein_bottle" title="wikilink">Klein bottle</a>, that cannot be <a href="embedding" title="wikilink">embedded</a> in three-dimensional Euclidean space without introducing <a href="singularity_theory" title="wikilink">singularities</a> or self-intersections.</p>
<h3 id="classification-of-surfaces">Classification of surfaces</h3>

<p>The <em>classification theorem of closed surfaces</em> states that any <a href="connected_(topology)" title="wikilink">connected</a> closed surface is homeomorphic to some member of one of these three families:</p>

<p>The surfaces in the first two families are <a href="orientability" title="wikilink">orientable</a>. It is convenient to combine the two families by regarding the sphere as the connected sum of 0 tori. The number <em>g</em> of tori involved is called the <em>genus</em> of the surface. The sphere and the torus have Euler characteristics 2 and 0, respectively, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of <em>g</em> tori is .</p>

<p>The surfaces in the third family are nonorientable. The Euler characteristic of the real projective plane is 1, and in general the Euler characteristic of the connected sum of <em>k</em> of them is .</p>
<h3 id="teichmüller-space">Teichmüller space</h3>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, the <strong>Teichmüller space</strong> <em>T<sub>X</sub></em> of a (real) topological surface <em>X</em>, is a space that parameterizes <a href="complex_manifold" title="wikilink">complex structures</a> on <em>X</em> up to the action of <a href="homeomorphism" title="wikilink">homeomorphisms</a> that are <a href="Homotopy#Isotopy" title="wikilink">isotopic</a> to the <a href="identity_function" title="wikilink">identity homeomorphism</a>. Each point in <em>T<sub>X</sub></em> may be regarded as an isomorphism class of 'marked' <a href="Riemann_surface" title="wikilink">Riemann surfaces</a> where a 'marking' is an isotopy class of homeomorphisms from <em>X</em> to <em>X</em>. The Teichmüller space is the <a href="orbifold" title="wikilink">universal covering orbifold</a> of the (Riemann) moduli space.</p>

<p>Teichmüller space has a canonical <a href="complex_number" title="wikilink">complex</a> <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a> structure and a wealth of natural metrics. The underlying topological space of Teichmüller space was studied by Fricke, and the Teichmüller metric on it was introduced by .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="uniformization-theorem">Uniformization theorem</h3>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, the <strong>uniformization theorem</strong> says that every <a href="simply_connected" title="wikilink">simply connected</a> <a href="Riemann_surface" title="wikilink">Riemann surface</a> is <a href="Conformal_equivalence" title="wikilink">conformally equivalent</a> to one of the three domains: the open <a href="unit_disk" title="wikilink">unit disk</a>, the <a href="complex_plane" title="wikilink">complex plane</a>, or the <a href="Riemann_sphere" title="wikilink">Riemann sphere</a>. In particular it admits a <a href="Riemannian_metric" title="wikilink">Riemannian metric</a> of <a href="constant_curvature" title="wikilink">constant curvature</a>. This classifies Riemannian surfaces as elliptic (positively curved – rather, admitting a constant positively curved metric), parabolic (flat), and hyperbolic (negatively curved) according to their <a href="universal_cover" title="wikilink">universal cover</a>.</p>

<p>The uniformization theorem is a generalization of the <a href="Riemann_mapping_theorem" title="wikilink">Riemann mapping theorem</a> from proper simply connected <a href="open_set" title="wikilink">open</a> <a href="subset" title="wikilink">subsets</a> of the plane to arbitrary simply connected Riemann surfaces.</p>
<h2 id="three-dimensions">Three dimensions</h2>

<p>A <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> <em>X</em> is a 3-manifold if every point in <em>X</em> has a <a href="neighbourhood_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">neighbourhood</a> that is <a class="uri" href="homeomorphic" title="wikilink">homeomorphic</a> to <a href="Euclidean_3-space" title="wikilink">Euclidean 3-space</a>.</p>

<p>The topological, <a href="Piecewise_linear_manifold" title="wikilink">piecewise-linear</a>, and smooth categories are all equivalent in three dimensions, so little distinction is made in whether we are dealing with say, topological 3-manifolds, or smooth 3-manifolds.</p>

<p>Phenomena in three dimensions can be strikingly different from phenomena in other dimensions, and so there is a prevalence of very specialized techniques that do not generalize to dimensions greater than three. This special role has led to the discovery of close connections to a diversity of other fields, such as <a href="knot_theory" title="wikilink">knot theory</a>, <a href="geometric_group_theory" title="wikilink">geometric group theory</a>, <a href="hyperbolic_geometry" title="wikilink">hyperbolic geometry</a>, <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>, <a href="Teichmüller_space" title="wikilink">Teichmüller theory</a>, <a href="topological_quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">topological quantum field theory</a>, <a href="gauge_theory" title="wikilink">gauge theory</a>, <a href="Floer_homology" title="wikilink">Floer homology</a>, and <a href="partial_differential_equations" title="wikilink">partial differential equations</a>. 3-manifold theory is considered a part of low-dimensional topology or <a href="geometric_topology" title="wikilink">geometric topology</a>.</p>
<h3 id="knot-and-braid-theory">Knot and braid theory</h3>

<p><a href="Knot_theory" title="wikilink">Knot theory</a> is the study of <a href="knot_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">mathematical knots</a>. While inspired by knots which appear in daily life in shoelaces and rope, a mathematician's knot differs in that the ends are joined together so that it cannot be undone. In mathematical language, a knot is an <a class="uri" href="embedding" title="wikilink">embedding</a> of a <a class="uri" href="circle" title="wikilink">circle</a> in 3-dimensional <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a>, <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup> (since we're using topology, a circle isn't bound to the classical geometric concept, but to all of its <a href="homeomorphism" title="wikilink">homeomorphisms</a>). Two mathematical knots are equivalent if one can be transformed into the other via a deformation of <strong>R</strong><sup>3</sup> upon itself (known as an <a href="ambient_isotopy" title="wikilink">ambient isotopy</a>); these transformations correspond to manipulations of a knotted string that do not involve cutting the string or passing the string through itself.</p>

<p><a href="Knot_complement" title="wikilink">Knot complements</a> are frequently-studied 3-manifolds. The knot complement of a <a href="tame_knot" title="wikilink">tame knot</a> <em>K</em> is the three-dimensional space surrounding the knot. To make this precise, suppose that <em>K</em> is a knot in a three-manifold <em>M</em> (most often, <em>M</em> is the <a class="uri" href="3-sphere" title="wikilink">3-sphere</a>). Let <em>N</em> be a <a href="tubular_neighborhood" title="wikilink">tubular neighborhood</a> of <em>K</em>; so <em>N</em> is a <a href="solid_torus" title="wikilink">solid torus</a>. The knot complement is then the <a href="complement_(set_theory)" title="wikilink">complement</a> of <em>N</em>,</p>

<p>A related topic is <a href="braid_theory" title="wikilink">braid theory</a>. Braid theory is an abstract <a href="geometry" title="wikilink">geometric</a> <a class="uri" href="theory" title="wikilink">theory</a> studying the everyday <a class="uri" href="braid" title="wikilink">braid</a> concept, and some generalizations. The idea is that braids can be organized into <a href="group_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">groups</a>, in which the group operation is 'do the first braid on a set of strings, and then follow it with a second on the twisted strings'. Such groups may be described by explicit <a href="presentation_of_a_group" title="wikilink">presentations</a>, as was shown by .<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> For an elementary treatment along these lines, see the article on <a href="braid_group" title="wikilink">braid groups</a>. Braid groups may also be given a deeper mathematical interpretation: as the <a href="fundamental_group" title="wikilink">fundamental group</a> of certain <a href="configuration_space" title="wikilink">configuration spaces</a>.</p>
<h3 id="hyperbolic-3-manifolds">Hyperbolic 3-manifolds</h3>

<p>A <a href="hyperbolic_3-manifold" title="wikilink">hyperbolic 3-manifold</a> is a <a class="uri" href="3-manifold" title="wikilink">3-manifold</a> equipped with a <a href="complete_space" title="wikilink">complete</a> <a href="Riemannian_metric" title="wikilink">Riemannian metric</a> of constant <a href="sectional_curvature" title="wikilink">sectional curvature</a> -1. In other words, it is the quotient of three-dimensional <a href="hyperbolic_space" title="wikilink">hyperbolic space</a> by a subgroup of hyperbolic isometries acting freely and <a href="Properly_discontinuous_action" title="wikilink">properly discontinuously</a>. See also <a href="Kleinian_model" title="wikilink">Kleinian model</a>.</p>

<p>Its thick-thin decomposition has a thin part consisting of tubular neighborhoods of closed geodesics and/or ends which are the product of a Euclidean surface and the closed half-ray. The manifold is of finite volume if and only if its thick part is compact. In this case, the ends are of the form torus cross the closed half-ray and are called <strong>cusps</strong>. Knot complements are the most commonly studied cusped manifolds.</p>
<h3 id="poincare-conjecture-and-geometrization">Poincare conjecture and Geometrization</h3>

<p><a href="Thurston's_geometrization_conjecture" title="wikilink">Thurston's geometrization conjecture</a> states that certain three-dimensional <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological spaces</a> each have a unique geometric structure that can be associated with them. It is an analogue of the <a href="uniformization_theorem" title="wikilink">uniformization theorem</a> for two-dimensional <a class="uri" href="surfaces" title="wikilink">surfaces</a>, which states that every <a href="simply_connected" title="wikilink">simply-connected</a> <a href="Riemann_surface" title="wikilink">Riemann surface</a> can be given one of three geometries (<a href="Euclidean_geometry" title="wikilink">Euclidean</a>, <a href="Spherical_geometry" title="wikilink">spherical</a>, or <a href="hyperbolic_geometry" title="wikilink">hyperbolic</a>). In three dimensions, it is not always possible to assign a single geometry to a whole topological space. Instead, the geometrization conjecture states that every closed <a class="uri" href="3-manifold" title="wikilink">3-manifold</a> can be decomposed in a canonical way into pieces that each have one of eight types of geometric structure. The conjecture was proposed by , and implies several other conjectures, such as the <a href="Poincaré_conjecture" title="wikilink">Poincaré conjecture</a> and Thurston's <a href="elliptization_conjecture" title="wikilink">elliptization conjecture</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="four-dimensions">Four dimensions</h2>

<p>A <strong>4-manifold</strong> is a 4-dimensional <a href="topological_manifold" title="wikilink">topological manifold</a>. A <strong>smooth 4-manifold</strong> is a 4-manifold with a <a href="smooth_structure" title="wikilink">smooth structure</a>. In dimension four, in marked contrast with lower dimensions, topological and smooth manifolds are quite different. There exist some topological 4-manifolds which admit no smooth structure and even if there exists a smooth structure it need not be unique (i.e. there are smooth 4-manifolds which are <a class="uri" href="homeomorphic" title="wikilink">homeomorphic</a> but not <a class="uri" href="diffeomorphic" title="wikilink">diffeomorphic</a>).</p>

<p>4-manifolds are of importance in physics because, in <a href="General_Relativity" title="wikilink">General Relativity</a>, <a class="uri" href="spacetime" title="wikilink">spacetime</a> is modeled as a <a class="uri" href="pseudo-Riemannian" title="wikilink">pseudo-Riemannian</a> 4-manifold.</p>
<h3 id="exotic-r4">Exotic R<sup>4</sup></h3>

<p>An <strong>exotic</strong> <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup> is a <a href="differentiable_manifold" title="wikilink">differentiable manifold</a> that is <a class="uri" href="homeomorphic" title="wikilink">homeomorphic</a> but not <a href="diffeomorphism" title="wikilink">diffeomorphic</a> to the <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a> <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup>. The first examples were found in the early 1980s by <a href="Michael_Freedman" title="wikilink">Michael Freedman</a>, by using the contrast between Freedman's theorems about topological 4-manifolds, and <a href="Simon_Donaldson" title="wikilink">Simon Donaldson</a>'s theorems about smooth 4-manifolds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> There is a <a href="cardinality_of_the_continuum" title="wikilink">continuum</a> of non-diffeomorphic <a href="differentiable_structure" title="wikilink">differentiable structures</a> of <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup>, as was shown first by <a href="Clifford_Taubes" title="wikilink">Clifford Taubes</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Prior to this construction, non-diffeomorphic <a href="smooth_structure" title="wikilink">smooth structures</a> on spheres — <a href="exotic_sphere" title="wikilink">exotic spheres</a> — were already known to exist, although the question of the existence of such structures for the particular case of the <a class="uri" href="4-sphere" title="wikilink">4-sphere</a> remained open (and still remains open as of 2014). For any positive integer <em>n</em> other than 4, there are no exotic smooth structures on <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup>; in other words, if <em>n</em> ≠ 4 then any smooth manifold homeomorphic to <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup> is diffeomorphic to <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="other-special-phenomena-in-4-dimensions">Other special phenomena in 4 dimensions</h3>

<p>There are several fundamental theorems about manifolds that can be proved by low-dimensional methods in dimensions at most 3, and by completely different high-dimensional methods in dimension at least 5, but which are false in dimension 4. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>In dimensions other than 4, the <a href="Kirby–Siebenmann_invariant" title="wikilink">Kirby–Siebenmann invariant</a> provides the obstruction to the existence of a PL structure; in other words a compact topological manifold has a PL structure if and only if its Kirby–Siebenmann invariant in H<sup>4</sup>(<em>M</em>,<strong>Z</strong>/2<strong>Z</strong>) vanishes. In dimension 3 and lower, every topological manifold admits an essentially unique PL structure. In dimension 4 there are many examples with vanishing Kirby–Siebenmann invariant but no PL structure.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>In any dimension other than 4, a compact topological manifold has only a finite number of essentially distinct PL or smooth structures. In dimension 4, compact manifolds can have a countable infinite number of non-diffeomorphic smooth structures.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Four is the only dimension <em>n</em> for which <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup> can have an exotic smooth structure. <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup> has an uncountable number of exotic smooth structures; see <a href="exotic_R4" title="wikilink">exotic <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup></a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The solution to the smooth <a href="Poincaré_conjecture" title="wikilink">Poincaré conjecture</a> is known in all dimensions other than 4 (it is usually false in dimensions at least 7; see <a href="exotic_sphere" title="wikilink">exotic sphere</a>). The Poincaré conjecture for <a href="PL_manifold" title="wikilink">PL manifolds</a> has been proved for all dimensions other than 4, but it is not known whether it is true in 4 dimensions (it is equivalent to the smooth Poincaré conjecture in 4 dimensions).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The smooth <a href="h-cobordism_theorem" title="wikilink">h-cobordism theorem</a> holds for cobordisms provided that neither the cobordism nor its boundary has dimension 4. It can fail if the boundary of the cobordism has dimension 4 (as shown by Donaldson). If the cobordism has dimension 4, then it is unknown whether the h-cobordism theorem holds.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A topological manifold of dimension not equal to 4 has a handlebody decomposition. Manifolds of dimension 4 have a handlebody decomposition if and only if they are smoothable.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>There are compact 4-dimensional topological manifolds that are not homeomorphic to any simplicial complex. In dimension at least 5 the existence of topological manifolds not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex was an open problem. In 2013 Ciprian Manolescu posted a preprint on the ArXiv showing that there are manifolds in each dimension greater than or equal to 5, that are not homeomorphic to a simplicial complex.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="a-few-typical-theorems-that-distinguish-low-dimensional-topology">A few typical theorems that distinguish low-dimensional topology</h2>

<p>There are several theorems that in effect state that many of the most basic tools used to study high-dimensional manifolds do not apply to low-dimensional manifolds, such as:</p>

<p><strong>Steenrod's theorem</strong> states that an orientable 3-manifold has a trivial <a href="tangent_bundle" title="wikilink">tangent bundle</a>. Stated another way, the only <a href="characteristic_class" title="wikilink">characteristic class</a> of a 3-manifold is the obstruction to orientability.</p>

<p>Any closed 3-manifold is the boundary of a 4-manifold. This theorem is due independently to several people: it follows from the <a href="Max_Dehn" title="wikilink">Dehn</a>–<a href="W._B._R._Lickorish" title="wikilink">Lickorish</a> theorem via a <a href="Heegaard_splitting" title="wikilink">Heegaard splitting</a> of the 3-manifold. It also follows from <a href="René_Thom" title="wikilink">René Thom</a>'s computation of the <a class="uri" href="cobordism" title="wikilink">cobordism</a> ring of closed manifolds.</p>

<p>The existence of <a href="Exotic_R4" title="wikilink">exotic smooth structures on <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup></a>. This was originally observed by <a href="Michael_Freedman" title="wikilink">Michael Freedman</a>, based on the work of <a href="Simon_Donaldson" title="wikilink">Simon Donaldson</a> and <a href="Andrew_Casson" title="wikilink">Andrew Casson</a>. It has since been elaborated by Freedman, <a href="Robert_Gompf" title="wikilink">Robert Gompf</a>, <a href="Clifford_Taubes" title="wikilink">Clifford Taubes</a> and <a href="Laurence_Taylor" title="wikilink">Laurence Taylor</a> to show there exists a continuum of non-diffeomorphic smooth structures on <strong>R</strong><sup>4</sup>. Meanwhile, <strong>R</strong><sup>n</sup> is known to have exactly one smooth structure up to diffeomorphism provided <em>n</em> ≠ 4.</p>
