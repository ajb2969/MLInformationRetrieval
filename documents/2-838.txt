   Counting measure      Counting measure   In mathematics , the counting measure is an intuitive way to put a measure on any set : the "size" of a subset is taken to be the number of elements in the subset, if the subset has finitely many elements, and ∞ if the subset is infinite . 1  The counting measure can be defined on any measurable set, but is mostly used on countable sets. 2  In formal notation, we can make any set X into a measurable space by taking the sigma-algebra    Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   of measurable subsets to consist of all subsets of   X   X   X   . Then the counting measure   μ   μ   \mu   on this measurable space    (  X  ,  Σ  )     X  normal-Σ    (X,\Sigma)   is the positive measure    Σ  →   [  0  ,   +  ∞   ]      normal-→  normal-Σ   0         \Sigma\rightarrow[0,+\infty]   defined by       μ   (  A  )    =   {      |  A  |      if  A  is finite        +  ∞      if  A  is infinite             μ  A    cases    A     if  A  is finite         if  A  is infinite      \mu(A)=\begin{cases}|A|&\text{if }A\text{ is finite}\\
 +\infty&\text{if }A\text{ is infinite}\end{cases}     for all    A  ∈  Σ      A  normal-Σ    A\in\Sigma   , where    |  A  |      A    |A|   denotes the cardinality of the set   A   A   A   . 3  The counting measure on    (  X  ,  Σ  )     X  normal-Σ    (X,\Sigma)   is σ-finite if and only if the space   X   X   X   is countable . 4  Discussion  The counting measure is a special case of a more general construct. With the notation as above, any function    f  :   X  →   [  0  ,  ∞  )       normal-:  f   normal-→  X   0       f\colon X\to[0,\infty)   defines a measure   μ   μ   \mu   on    (  X  ,  Σ  )     X  normal-Σ    (X,\Sigma)   via      μ   (  A  ⊆  X  )   :=   ∑   a  ∈  A    f   (  a  )   ,     fragments  μ   fragments  normal-(  A   X  normal-)   assign   subscript     a  A    f   fragments  normal-(  a  normal-)   normal-,    \mu(A\subseteq X):=\sum_{a\in A}f(a),   where the possibly uncountable sum of real numbers is defined to be the sup of the sums over all finite subsets, i.e.,         ∑   y  ∈  Y  ⊆  ℝ    y   :=    sup    F  ⊆  Y   ,    |  F  |   <  ∞      {    ∑   y  ∈  F    y   }     .     assign    subscript       y  Y       ℝ     y     subscript  supremum   formulae-sequence    F  Y       F          subscript     y  F    y       \sum_{y\in Y\subseteq\mathbb{R}}y:=\sup_{F\subseteq Y,|F|<\infty}\left\{\sum_{%
 y\in F}y\right\}.   Taking f(x)=1 for all x in X produces the counting measure.  Notes  References   Schilling, René L. (2005)."Measures, Integral and Martingales". Cambridge University Press.
