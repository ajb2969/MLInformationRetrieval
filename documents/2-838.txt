Counting measure

In mathematics, the counting measure is an intuitive way to put a measure on any set: the "size" of a subset is taken to be the number of elements in the subset, if the subset has finitely many elements, and ∞ if the subset is infinite.1
The counting measure can be defined on any measurable set, but is mostly used on countable sets.2
In formal notation, we can make any set X into a measurable space by taking the sigma-algebra

 
  of measurable subsets to consist of all subsets of 
 
 
 
 . Then the counting measure 
 
 
 
  on this measurable space 
 
 
 
  is the positive measure 
 
 
 
  defined by



for all 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the cardinality of the set 
 
 
 
 .3
The counting measure on 
 
 
 
  is σ-finite if and only if the space 
 
 
 
  is countable.4
Discussion
The counting measure is a special case of a more general construct. With the notation as above, any function 
 
 
 
  defines a measure 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  via


 
  where the possibly uncountable sum of real numbers is defined to be the sup of the sums over all finite subsets, i.e.,


 
  Taking f(x)=1 for all x in X produces the counting measure.
