   Hyperbolic spiral      Hyperbolic spiral   thumb|200px|right|Hyperbolic spiral for a=2  A hyperbolic spiral is a transcendental  plane curve also known as a reciprocal spiral . 1 A hyperbolic spiral is the opposite of an Archimedean spiral 2 and is a type of Cotes' spiral .  Pierre Varignon first studied the curve in 1704. 3 Later Johann Bernoulli and Roger Cotes worked on the curve as well.  Equation  The hyperbolic spiral has the polar equation:      r  =   a  θ       r    a  θ     r=\frac{a}{\theta}     It begins at an infinite distance from the pole in the center (for θ starting from zero r = a/θ starts from infinity), and it winds faster and faster around as it approaches the pole; the distance from any point to the pole, following the curve, is infinite. Applying the transformation from the polar coordinate system:        x  =   r   cos  θ     ,   y  =   r   sin  θ      ,     formulae-sequence    x    r    θ       y    r    θ       x=r\cos\theta,\qquad y=r\sin\theta,   leads to the following parametric representation in Cartesian coordinates :        x  =   a    cos  t   t     ,   y  =   a    sin  t   t      ,     formulae-sequence    x    a      t   t       y    a      t   t       x=a{\cos t\over t},\qquad y=a{\sin t\over t},   where the parameter  t is an equivalent of the polar coordinate θ.  Properties  Asymptote  The spiral has an asymptote at y = a : for t approaching zero the ordinate approaches a , while the abscissa grows to infinity:         lim   t  →  0    x   =   a    lim   t  →  0      cos  t   t     =  ∞   ,          subscript    normal-→  t  0    x     a    subscript    normal-→  t  0        t   t              \lim_{t\to 0}x=a\lim_{t\to 0}{\cos t\over t}=\infty,            lim   t  →  0    y   =   a    lim   t  →  0      sin  t   t     =   a  ⋅  1   =  a   .          subscript    normal-→  t  0    y     a    subscript    normal-→  t  0        t   t           normal-⋅  a  1        a     \lim_{t\to 0}y=a\lim_{t\to 0}{\sin t\over t}=a\cdot 1=a.     Curvature  Using the representation of the hyperbolic spiral in polar coordinates, the curvature can be found by      κ  =      r  2   +   2   r  θ  2     -   r   r   θ  θ        (    r  2   +   r  θ  2    )    3  /  2         κ         superscript  r  2     2   superscript   subscript  r  θ   2       r   subscript  r    θ  θ       superscript     superscript  r  2    subscript   superscript  r  2   θ      3  2       \kappa={r^{2}+2r_{\theta}^{2}-rr_{\theta\theta}\over(r^{2}+r^{2}_{\theta})^{3/%
 2}}     where       r  θ   =    d  r    d  θ    =    -  a    θ  2           subscript  r  θ       d  r     d  θ             a    superscript  θ  2       r_{\theta}={dr\over d\theta}={-a\over\theta^{2}}     and        r   θ  θ    =     d  2   r    d   θ  2     =    2  a    θ  3     .         subscript  r    θ  θ         superscript  d  2   r     d   superscript  θ  2              2  a    superscript  θ  3       r_{\theta\theta}={d^{2}r\over d\theta^{2}}={2a\over\theta^{3}}.     Then the curvature at   θ   θ   \theta   reduces to        κ   (  θ  )    =    θ  4    a    (    θ  2   +  1   )    3  /  2       .        κ  θ      superscript  θ  4     a   superscript     superscript  θ  2   1     3  2        \kappa(\theta)={\theta^{4}\over a(\theta^{2}+1)^{3/2}}.     The curvature tends to infinity as   θ   θ   \theta   tends to infinity. For values of   θ   θ   \theta   between 0 and 1, the curvature increases exponentially, and for values greater than 1, the curvature increases at an approximately linear rate with respect to the angle.  Tangents  The tangential angle of the hyperbolic curve is        ϕ   (  θ  )    =   -    tan   -  1    θ     .        ϕ  θ       superscript     1    θ      \phi(\theta)=-\tan^{-1}\theta.
