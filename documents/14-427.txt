Jacobi method for complex Hermitian matrices

In mathematics, the Jacobi method for complex Hermitian matrices is a generalization of the Jacobi iteration method. The Jacobi iteration method is also explained in "Introduction to Linear Algebra" by .
Derivation
The complex unitary rotation matrices Rpq can be used for Jacobi iteration of complex Hermitian matrices in order to find a numerical estimation of their eigenvectors and eigenvalues simultaneously.
Similar to the Givens rotation matrices, Rpq are defined as:



Each rotation matrix, Rpq, will modify only the pth and qth rows or columns of a matrix M if it is applied from left or right, respectively:



A Hermitian matrix, H is defined by the conjugate transpose symmetry property:



By definition, the complex conjugate of a complex unitary rotation matrix, R is its inverse and also a complex unitary rotation matrix:



Hence, the complex equivalent Givens transformation

 
  of a Hermitian matrix H is also a Hermitian matrix similar to H:



The elements of T can be calculated by the relations above. The important elements for the Jacobi iteration are the following four:



Each Jacobi iteration with RJpq generates a transformed matrix, TJ, with TJp,q = 0. The rotation matrix RJp,q is defined as a product of two complex unitary rotation matrices.



where the phase terms, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are given by:



Finally, it is important to note that the product of two complex rotation matrices for given angles θ1 and θ2 cannot be transformed into a single complex unitary rotation matrix Rpq(θ). The product of two complex rotation matrices are given by:
