   Arginine—tRNA ligase      Arginine—tRNA ligase   In enzymology , an arginine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-arginine + tRNAArg   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-arginyl-tRNAArg   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-arginine , and tRNA(Arg) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and L-arginyl-tRNA(Arg) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-arginine:tRNAArg ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include arginyl-tRNA synthetase , arginyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase , arginyl-transfer RNA synthetase , arginyl transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase , arginine-tRNA synthetase , and arginine translase . This enzyme participates in arginine and proline metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis .  It contains a conserved domain at the N terminus called arginyl tRNA synthetase N terminal domain or additional domain 1 (Add-1). This domain is about 140 residues long and it has been suggested that it is involved in tRNA recognition. 1  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
