   Christofides algorithm      Christofides algorithm   The goal of the Christofides approximation algorithm (named after Nicos Christofides) is to find a solution to the instances of the traveling salesman problem where the edge weights satisfy the triangle inequality . Let    G  =   (  V  ,  w  )       G   V  w     G=(V,w)   be an instance of TSP, i.e.   G   G   G   is a complete graph on the set   V   V   V   of vertices with weight function   w   w   w   assigning a nonnegative real weight to every edge of   G   G   G   .  Algorithm  In pseudo-code :   Create a minimum spanning tree    T   T   T   of   G   G   G   .  Let   O   O   O   be the set of vertices with odd degree in   T   T   T   and find a perfect matching    M   M   M   with minimum weight in the complete graph over the vertices from   O   O   O   .  Combine the edges of   M   M   M   and   T   T   T   to form a multigraph    H   H   H   .  Form an Eulerian circuit in   H   H   H   (H is Eulerian because it is connected, with only even-degree vertices ).  Make the circuit found in previous step Hamiltonian by skipping visited nodes ( shortcutting ).   Approximation ratio  The cost of the solution produced by the algorithm is within 3/2 of the optimum.  The proof is as follows:  Let denote the edge set of the optimal solution of TSP for . Because is connected, it contains some spanning tree and thus . Further let   B   B   B   denote the edge set of the optimal solution of TSP for the complete graph over vertices from   O   O   O   . Because the edge weights are triangular (so visiting more nodes cannot reduce total cost), we know that . We show that there is a perfect matching of vertices from   O   O   O   with weight under and therefore we have the same upper bound for   M   M   M   (because   M   M   M   is a perfect matching of minimum cost). Because   O   O   O   must contain an even number of vertices, a perfect matching exists. Let be the (only) Eulerian path in    (  O  ,  B  )     O  B    (O,B)   . Clearly both and are perfect matchings and the weight of at least one of them is less than or equal to . Thus and from the triangle inequality it follows that the algorithm is 3/2-approximative.

(Figure)  TuM.svg    Unite matching and spanning tree (    T  ∪  M      T  M    T\cup M   ).    (Figure)  Eulertour.svg    Calculate Euler tour on    T  ∪  M      T  M    T\cup M   (A-B-C-A-D-E-A).    (Figure)  Eulertour bereinigt.svg    Remove reoccuring vertices and replace by direct connections (A-B-C-D-E-A). In metric graphs, this step can not lengthen the tour. This tour is the algorithm's output.
