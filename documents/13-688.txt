   Bull graph      Bull graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the bull graph is a planar  undirected graph with 5 vertices and 5 edges, in the form of a triangle with two disjoint pendant edges. 1  It has chromatic number 3, chromatic index 3, radius 2, diameter 3 and girth 3. It is also a 1- vertex-connected graph and a 1- edge-connected graph .  Bull-free graphs  A graph is bull-free if it has no bull as an induced subgraph . The triangle-free graphs are bull-free graphs, since every bull contains a triangle. The strong perfect graph theorem was proven for bull-free graphs long before its proof for general graphs, 2 and a polynomial time recognition algorithm for Bull-free perfect graphs is known. 3  Maria Chudnovsky and Shmuel Safra have studied bull-free graphs more generally, showing that any such graph must have either a large clique or a large independent set , 4 and developing a general structure theory for these graphs. 5 6 7  Chromatic and characteristic polynomial  [[ File:Chromatically equivalent graphs.svg|thumb|left|200px|   The three graphs with a chromatic polynomial equal to     (   x  -  2   )     (   x  -  1   )   3   x        x  2    superscript    x  1   3   x    (x-2)(x-1)^{3}x   .   ]]  The chromatic polynomial of the bull graph is     (   x  -  2   )     (   x  -  1   )   3   x        x  2    superscript    x  1   3   x    (x-2)(x-1)^{3}x   .
