   Succinyl-CoA hydrolase      Succinyl-CoA hydrolase   In enzymology , a succinyl-CoA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinyl-CoA + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + succinate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and H 2 O , whereas its two products are CoA and succinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA hydrolase . Other names in common use include succinyl-CoA acylase , succinyl coenzyme A hydrolase , and succinyl coenzyme A deacylase . This enzyme participates in citrate cycle (tca cycle) .
