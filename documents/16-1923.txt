N conjecture

In number theory the n conjecture is a conjecture stated by  as a generalization of the abc conjecture to more than three integers.
Formulations
Given 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  satisfy three conditions:

(i) 
 
 

(ii) 
 
 

(iii) no proper subsum of 
 
 
 
  equals 
 
 


First formulation
The n conjecture states that for every 
 
 
 
 , there is a constant 
 
 
 
 , depending on 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , such that:





where 
 
 
 
  denotes the radical of the integer 
 
 
 
 , defined as the product of the distinct prime factors of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Second formulation
Define the quality of 
 
 
 
  as


 
  The n conjecture states that 
 
 
 
 .
Stronger form
proposed a stronger variant of the n conjecture, where setwise coprimeness of 
 
 
 
  is replaced by pairwise coprimeness of 
 
 
 
 
 .
There are two different formulations of this strong n conjecture.
Given 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  satisfy three conditions:

(i) 
 
 
 
  are pairwise coprime
 
(ii) 
 
 

(iii) no proper subsum of 
 
 
 
 
  equals 
 
 


First formulation
