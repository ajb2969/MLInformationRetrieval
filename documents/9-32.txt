   Dense-in-itself      Dense-in-itself   In mathematics , a subset    A   A   A   of a topological space is said to be dense-in-itself if   A   A   A   contains no isolated points .  Every dense-in-itself closed set is perfect . Conversely, every perfect set is dense-in-itself.  A simple example of a set which is dense-in-itself but not closed (and hence not a perfect set) is the subset of irrational numbers (considered as a subset of the real numbers ). This set is dense-in-itself because every neighborhood of an irrational number   x   x   x   contains at least one other irrational number    y  ≠  x      y  x    y\neq x   . On the other hand, this set of irrationals is not closed because every rational number lies in its closure . For similar reasons, the set of rational numbers (also considered as a subset of the real numbers ) is also dense-in-itself but not closed.  The above examples, the irrationals and the rationals, are also dense sets in their topological space, namely   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . As an example that is dense-in-itself but not dense in its topological space, consider    ℚ  ∩   [  0  ,  1  ]       ℚ   0  1     \mathbb{Q}\cap[0,1]   . This set is not dense in   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   but is dense-in-itself.  See also   Nowhere dense set  Dense order  Perfect space  Glossary of topology   References     "  Category:Topology
