Altronate dehydratase

In enzymology, an altronate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-altronate 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-altronate, and two products, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-altronate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate-forming). This enzyme is also called D-altronate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
