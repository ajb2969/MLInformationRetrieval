   Hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase (geranylgeranyl-diphosphate specific)      Hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase (geranylgeranyl-diphosphate specific)   Hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase (geranylgeranyl-diphosphate specific) (, HexPS , (all-E) hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase , (all-trans) hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase , hexaprenyl pyrophosphate synthase , HexPPs , hexaprenyl diphosphate synthase ) is an enzyme with system name geranylgeranyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate transferase (adding 2 isopentenyl units) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranylgeranyl diphosphate + 2 isopentenyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 diphosphate + all-trans-hexaprenyl diphosphate   The enzyme prefers geranylgeranyl diphosphate to farnesyl diphosphate as an allylic substrate.
