Precorrin-2 dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a precorrin-2 dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

precorrin-2 + NAD+

 
  sirohydrochlorin + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are precorrin 2 and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are sirohydrochlorin, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is precorrin-2:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include Met8p, SirC, and CysG. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism.
