<h1>Join-calculus</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The <strong>join-calculus</strong> is a <a href="process_calculus" title="wikilink">process calculus</a> developed at <a class="uri" href="INRIA" title="wikilink">INRIA</a>. The join-calculus was developed to provide a formal basis for the design of distributed programming languages, and therefore intentionally avoids communications constructs found in other process calculi, such as <a href="synchronous_rendezvous" title="wikilink">rendezvous</a> communications, which are difficult to implement in a distributed setting.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Despite this limitation, the join-calculus is as expressive as the full <a href="Pi-calculus" title="wikilink"><span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>-calculus</a>. Encodings of the <span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>-calculus in the join-calculus, and vice versa, have been demonstrated.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The join-calculus is a member of the <a href="Pi-calculus" title="wikilink"><span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>-calculus</a> family of process calculi, and can be considered, at its core, an asynchronous <span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>-calculus with several strong restrictions:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<ul>
<li>Scope restriction, reception, and replicated reception are syntactically merged into a single construct, the <em>definition</em>;</li>
<li>Communication occurs only on defined names;</li>
<li>For every defined name there is exactly one replicated reception.</li>
</ul>
<p>However, as a language for programming, the join-calculus offers at least one convenience over the <span class="LaTeX">$\pi$</span>-calculus — namely the use of <em>multi-way join patterns</em>, the ability to match against messages from multiple channels simultaneously.</p>
<h2 id="languages-based-on-the-join-calculus">Languages based on the join-calculus</h2>
<p>The join-calculus programming language is a new language based on the join-calculus process calculus. It is implemented as an interpreter written in <a class="uri" href="OCaml" title="wikilink">OCaml</a>, and supports statically typed distributed programming, transparent remote communication, agent-based mobility, and failure-detection.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<p>Many implementations of the join-calculus were made as extensions of existing programming languages:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="uri" href="JoCaml" title="wikilink">JoCaml</a> is a version of <a class="uri" href="OCaml" title="wikilink">OCaml</a> extended with join-calculus primitives.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="Polyphonic_C_sharp" title="wikilink">Polyphonic C#</a> and its successor <a class="uri" href="Cω" title="wikilink">Cω</a> extend <a href="C_Sharp_(programming_language)" title="wikilink">C#</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>MC# and Parallel C# extend Polyphonic C#.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><a href="Join_Java" title="wikilink">Join Java</a> extends <a href="Java_(programming_language)" title="wikilink">Java</a>.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A Concurrent Basic proposal that uses Join-calculus</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>JErlang (the J is for Join, erjang is Erlang for the JVM)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="embeddings-in-other-programming-languages">Embeddings in other programming languages</h2>
<p>These implementations do not change the underlying programming language but introduce join calculus operations through a custom library:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Boost.Join library is an implementation in C++ within the Boost framework.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The ScalaJoins library is in Scala.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Joinads - various implementations of join calculus in F#.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>CocoaJoin is an experimental implementation in Objective-C for iOS and Mac OS X.</li>
</ul>
