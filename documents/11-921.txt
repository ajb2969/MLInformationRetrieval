   Glycerophospholipid acyltransferase (CoA-dependent)      Glycerophospholipid acyltransferase (CoA-dependent)   In enzymology , a glycerophospholipid acyltransferase (CoA-dependent) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine , whereas its two products are 1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and 1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-organyl-2-acyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine:1-organyl-2-lyso-sn-gly cero-3-phosphoethanolamine acyltransferase (CoA-dependent) .
