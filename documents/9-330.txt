   Equiareal map      Equiareal map   In differential geometry , an equiareal map is a smooth map from one surface to another that preserves the area of figures. If M and N are two surfaces in the Euclidean space  R 3 , then an equi-areal map ƒ can be characterized by any of the following equivalent conditions:   The surface area of ƒ ( U ) is equal to the area of U for every open set  U on M .  The pullback of the area element μ N on N is equal to μ M , the area element on M .  At each point p of M , and tangent vectors  v and w to M at p ,          |     d   f  p    (  v  )    ×  d    f  p    (  w  )    |   =   |   v  ×  w   |               d   subscript  f  p   v   d    subscript  f  p   w        v  w      |df_{p}(v)\times df_{p}(w)|=|v\times w|\,       where × denotes the Euclidean cross product of vectors and dƒ denotes the pushforward along ƒ .   An example of an equiareal map, due to Archimedes of Syracuse , is the projection from the unit sphere to the unit cylinder outward from their common axis. An explicit formula is       f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )    =   (   x     x  2   +   y  2      ,   y     x  2   +   y  2      ,  z  )         f   x  y  z       x       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        y       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      z     f(x,y,z)=\left(\frac{x}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}},\frac{y}{\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}},z\right)   for ( x , y , z ) a point on the unit sphere.  In the context of geographic maps , a map projection is called equiareal , area-preserving , or more commonly equi-area , if areas are preserved up to a constant factor; embedding the target map, usually considered a subset of R 2 , in the obvious way in R 3 , the requirement above then is weakened to:       |     d   f  p    (  v  )    ×  d    f  p    (  w  )    |   =   κ   |   v  ×  w   |                d   subscript  f  p   v   d    subscript  f  p   w      κ      v  w       |df_{p}(v)\times df_{p}(w)|=\kappa|v\times w|\,     for some κ > 0 not depending on   v   v   v   and   w   w   w   . For examples of such projections, see Equal-area map projections . Linear equi-areal maps are 2 × 2 real matrices making up the group SL(2, R ) of special linear transformations.
