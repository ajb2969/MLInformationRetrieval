   Conjugate index      Conjugate index   In mathematics , two real numbers      p  ,  q   >  1       p  q   1    p,q>1   are called conjugate indices if        1  p   +   1  q    =  1.          1  p     1  q    1.    \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{q}=1.     Formally, we will also define    q  =  ∞      q     q=\infty   as conjugate to    p  =  1      p  1    p=1   and vice versa .  Conjugate indices are used in Hölder's inequality . Also, if     p  ,  q   >  1       p  q   1    p,q>1   are conjugate indices, the spaces L p and L q are dual to each other (see L p space ).
