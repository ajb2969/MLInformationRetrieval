Conjugate index

In mathematics, two real numbers

 
  are called conjugate indices if



Formally, we will also define 
 
 
 
  as conjugate to 
 
 
 
  and vice versa.
Conjugate indices are used in Hölder's inequality. Also, if 
 
 
 
  are conjugate indices, the spaces Lp and Lq are dual to each other (see Lp space).
