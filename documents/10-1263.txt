Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)




Aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+)

In enzymology, an aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

an aldehyde + NADP+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  an acid + NADPH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are aldehyde, NADP+, and H2O, whereas its 3 products are acid, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aldehyde:NADP+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include NADP+-acetaldehyde dehydrogenase, NADP+-dependent aldehyde dehydrogenase, and aldehyde dehydrogenase (NADP+). This enzyme participates in caprolactam degradation.
