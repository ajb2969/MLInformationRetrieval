Smale's problems
'''Smale's problems''' are a list of eighteen [[unsolved problems in mathematics]] that was proposed by [[Stephen Smale|Steve Smale]] in 1998,{{cite journal | first = Steve | last = Smale|title = Mathematical Problems for the Next Century|journal = Mathematical Intelligencer|year =1998|volume=20|number=2|pages=7–15|id = |doi=10.1007/bf03025291}} republished in 1999.1 Smale composed this list in reply to a request from Vladimir Arnold, then vice-president of the International Mathematical Union, who asked several mathematicians to propose a list of problems for the 21st century. Arnold's inspiration came from the list of Hilbert's problems that had been published at the beginning of the 20th century.

Formulation
Status




1
Riemann hypothesis (see also Hilbert's eighth problem)





2
Poincaré conjecture
Proved by Grigori Perelman in 2003 using Ricci flow.234


3
Does P = NP?



4
Shub–Smale τ-conjecture on the integer zeros of a polynomial of one variable56



5
Height bounds for Diophantine curves



6
Finiteness of the number of relative equilibria in celestial mechanics
Proved for five bodies by A. Albouy and V. Kaloshin in 2012.7


7
Distribution of points on the 2-sphere
A noteworthy form of this problem is the Thomson Problem of equal point charges on a unit sphere governed by the electrostatic Coulomb's law. Very few exact N-point solutions are known while most solutions are numerical. Numerical solutions to this problem have been shown to correspond well with features of electron shell-filling in Atomic structure found throughout the periodic table.8 A well-defined, intermediate step to this problem involving a point charge at the origin has been reported.9


8
Extend the mathematical model of general equilibrium theory to include price adjustments



9
The linear programming problem: find a strongly-polynomial time algorithm which for given matrix A ∈ Rm×n and b ∈ Rm decides whether there exists x ∈ Rn with Ax ≥ b.



10
Pugh's closing lemma (higher order of smoothness)



11
Is one-dimensional dynamics generally hyperbolic?
Smale states two variants of this problem: the complex-variable one ("Can a complex polynomial $T$ be approximated by one of the same degree with the property that every critical point tends to a periodic sink under iteration?") and the real-variable version ("Can a smooth map $T : 0,1 1 → 0,1 1$ be  approximated by one which is hyperbolic, for all $r > 1?$"). The former remains open even in the simplest parameter space of polynomials, the Mandelbrot set. The latter was proved by Kozlovski, Shen and van Strien10 in 2007.


12
Centralizers of diffeomorphisms
Solved in the C1 topology by C. Bonatti, S. Crovisier and Amie Wilkinson11 in 2009.


13
Hilbert's 16th problem





14
Lorenz attractor
Solved by Warwick Tucker in 2002 using interval arithmetic.12


15
Do the Navier–Stokes equations in R3 always have a unique smooth solution that extends for all time?



16
Jacobian conjecture



17
Solving polynomial equations in polynomial time in the average case
C. Beltrán and L. M. Pardo found a uniform probabilistic algorithm (average Las Vegas algorithm) for Smale's 17th problem.1314 A deterministic algorithm for Smale's 17th problem has not been found yet, but a partial answer has been given by F. Cucker and P. Bürgisser who proceeded to the smoothed analysis of a probabilistic algorithm à la Beltrán-Pardo, and then exhibited a deterministic algorithm running in time $N^{O(\log\log N)}$.15


18
Limits of intelligence




Smale also listed 3 additional problems:16

Mean value problem
Is the three-sphere a minimal set?
Is an Anosov diffeomorphism of a compact manifold topologically the same as the Lie group model of John Franks?
