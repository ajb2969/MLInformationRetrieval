   Weighing matrix      Weighing matrix   In mathematics , a weighing matrix  W of order n and weight w is an n × n (0,1,-1)-matrix such that     W   W  T    =   w   I  n          W   superscript  W  T      w   subscript  I  n      WW^{T}=wI_{n}   , where    W  T     superscript  W  T    W^{T}   is the transpose of   W   W   W   and    I  n     subscript  I  n    I_{n}   is the identity matrix of order   n   n   n   .  For convenience, a weighing matrix of order n and weight w is often denoted by W ( n , w ). A W ( n , n ) is a Hadamard matrix and a W(n,n-1) is equivalent to a conference matrix .  Properties  Some properties are immediate from the definition. If W is a W ( n , w ), then:   The rows of W are pairwise orthogonal (that is, every pair of rows you pick from W will be orthogonal). Similarly, the columns are pairwise orthogonal.  Each row and each column of W has exactly w non-zero elements.        W  T   W   =   w  I          superscript  W  T   W     w  I     W^{T}W=wI   , since the definition means that     W   -  1    =    w   -  1     W  T         superscript  W    1       superscript  w    1     superscript  W  T      W^{-1}=w^{-1}W^{T}   , where    W   -  1      superscript  W    1     W^{-1}   is the inverse of   W   W   W   .       det   (  W  )    =   ±   w   n  /  2          det  W    plus-or-minus   superscript  w    n  2       \operatorname{det}(W)=\pm w^{n/2}   where    det   (  W  )      det  W    \operatorname{det}(W)   is the determinant of   W   W   W   .   Examples  Note that when weighing matrices are displayed, the symbol   -     -   is used to represent -1. Here are two examples:  This is a W ( 2 , 2 ):      (     1    1      1    -     )      1  1    1      \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\
 1&-\end{pmatrix}     This is a W ( 7 , 4 ):      (     1    1    1    1    0    0    0      1    -    0    0    1    1    0      1    0    -    0    -    0    1      1    0    0    -    0    -    -      0    1    -    0    0    1    -      0    1    0    -    1    0    1      0    0    1    -    -    1    0     )      1  1  1  1  0  0  0    1   0  0  1  1  0    1  0   0   0  1    1  0  0   0      0  1   0  0  1     0  1  0   1  0  1    0  0  1    1  0     \begin{pmatrix}1&1&1&1&0&0&0\\
 1&-&0&0&1&1&0\\
 1&0&-&0&-&0&1\\
 1&0&0&-&0&-&-\\
 0&1&-&0&0&1&-\\
 0&1&0&-&1&0&1\\
 0&0&1&-&-&1&0\end{pmatrix}     Equivalence  Two weighing matrices are considered to be equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by a series of permutations and negations of the rows and columns of the matrix. The classification of weighing matrices is complete for cases where w ≤ 5 as well as all cases where n ≤ 15 are also completed. 1 However, very little has been done beyond this with exception to classifying circulant weighing matrices. 2 3  Open Questions  There are many open questions about weighing matrices. The main question about weighing matrices is their existence: for which values of n and w does there exist a W ( n , w )? A great deal about this is unknown. An equally important but often overlooked question about weighing matrices is their enumeration: for a given n and w , how many W ( n , w )'s are there?
