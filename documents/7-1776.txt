   Metric connection      Metric connection   In mathematics , a metric connection is a connection in a vector bundle  E equipped with a metric for which the inner product of any two vectors will remain the same when those vectors are parallel transported along any curve. Other common equivalent formulations of a metric connection include:   A connection for which the covariant derivatives of the metric on E vanish.  A principal connection on the bundle of orthonormal frames of E .   A special case of a metric connection is the Levi-Civita connection . Here the bundle E is the tangent bundle of a manifold. In addition to being a metric connection, the Levi-Civita connection is required to be torsion free .  Riemannian connections  An important special case of a metric connection is a Riemannian connection . This is a connection   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   on the tangent bundle of a pseudo-Riemannian manifold ( M , g ) such that      ∇  X   g   =  0        subscript  normal-∇  X   g   0    \nabla_{X}g=0   for all vector fields X on M . Equivalently,   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   is Riemannian if the parallel transport it defines preserves the metric g .  A given connection   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   is Riemannian if and only if       X  g   (  Y  ,  Z  )    =    g   (    ∇  X   Y   ,  Z  )    +   g   (  Y  ,    ∇  X   Z   )           X  g   Y  Z        g     subscript  normal-∇  X   Y   Z      g   Y    subscript  normal-∇  X   Z        Xg(Y,Z)=g(\nabla_{X}Y,Z)+g(Y,\nabla_{X}Z)   for all vector fields X , Y and Z on M , where    X  g   (  Y  ,  Z  )       X  g   Y  Z     Xg(Y,Z)   denotes the derivative of the function    g   (  Y  ,  Z  )       g   Y  Z     g(Y,Z)   along this vector field   X   X   X   .  The Levi-Civita connection is the torsion-free Riemannian connection on a manifold. It is unique by the fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry .  Metric compatibility  In mathematics, given a metric tensor     g   a  b      subscript  g    a  b     g_{ab}   , a covariant derivative is said to be compatible with the metric if the following condition is satisfied:         ∇  c     g   a  b     =  0.        subscript  normal-∇  c    subscript  g    a  b     0.    \nabla_{c}\,g_{ab}=0.     Although other covariant derivatives may be supported within the metric, usually one only ever considers the metric-compatible one. This is because given two covariant derivatives,   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   and    ∇  ′     superscript  normal-∇  normal-′    \nabla^{\prime}   , there exists a tensor for transforming from one to the other:         ∇  a    x  b    =     ∇  a  ′    x  b    -    C   a  b     c    x  c      .        subscript  normal-∇  a    subscript  x  b        superscript   subscript  normal-∇  a   normal-′    subscript  x  b       superscript   subscript  C    a  b    c    subscript  x  c       \nabla_{a}x_{b}=\nabla_{a}^{\prime}x_{b}-{C_{ab}}^{c}x_{c}.     If the space is also torsion-free , then the tensor    C   a  b     c     superscript   subscript  C    a  b    c    {C_{ab}}^{c}   is symmetric in its first two indices.
