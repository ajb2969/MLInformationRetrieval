Absolute neutrophil count

Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) is a measure of the number of neutrophil granulocytes1 (also known as polymorphonuclear cells, PMN's, polys, granulocytes, segmented neutrophils or segs) present in the blood. Neutrophils are a type of white blood cell that fights against infection.
The ANC is almost always part of a larger blood panel called the complete blood count. The ANC is calculated from measurements of the total number of white blood cells (WBC), usually based on the combined percentage of mature neutrophils (sometimes called "segs," or segmented cells) and bands, which are immature neutrophils.
Clinical significance
The reference range for ANC in adults varies by study, but 1500 to 8000 cells per microliter is typical. An ANC less than 500 cells/µL is defined as neutropenia and significantly increases risk of infection. Neutropenia is the condition of a low ANC, and the most common condition where an ANC would be measured is in the setting of chemotherapy for cancer.
Neutrophilia indicates an elevated count. This is also known as a "left shift" and can be indicative of:

Premature release of myeloid cells from the bone marrow.
A leukemoid reaction.

Calculation
ANC = 
 
 

or
ANC = (Absolute-Polys + Absolute-Bands)
In the above, we assume that the WBC is given in cells/µL (or thousand cells/mL, i.e. K/mL) such as 8,800 cells/µL or 8,800 K/mL; if the WBC were given in K/µL (instead of cells/µL or K/mL), such as 8.8 K/µL, you would first convert to cells/µL by multiplying the WBC by 1000.
The unit of ANC is cells per microliter of blood (abbreviated cells/µL; a microliter is equal to one cubic millimeter because 1,000,000 cubic millimeters are equal to one liter).
