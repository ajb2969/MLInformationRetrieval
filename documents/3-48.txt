   Almost perfect number      Almost perfect number  In [[mathematics]], an '''almost perfect number''' (sometimes also called '''slightly defective''' or '''least deficient''' '''number''') is a [[natural number]] ''n'' such that the [[summation|sum]] of all [[divisor]]s of n (the sum-of-divisors function  σ ( n )) is equal to 2 n − 1, the sum of all proper divisors of n , s ( n ) = σ ( n ) − n , then being equal to n − 1. The only known almost perfect numbers are powers of 2 with non-negative exponents . Therefore the only known odd almost perfect number is 2 0 = 1, and the only known even almost perfect numbers are those of the form 2 k for some positive number k ; however, it has not been shown that all almost perfect numbers are of this form. It is known that an odd almost perfect number greater than 1 would have at least 6 prime factors. 1 2  If m is an odd almost perfect number then  is a Descartes number . 3 Moreover if a and b are positive odd integers such that $b+3 and such that {{nowrap|4''m'' − ''a''}} and {{nowrap|4''m'' + ''b''}} are both primes, then {{nowrap|m''(4''m'' − ''a'')(4''m'' + ''b'')}} would be an odd [[weird number]]. {{cite journal
