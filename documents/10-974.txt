   Columbamine oxidase      Columbamine oxidase   In enzymology , a columbamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 columbamine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 berberine + 2 H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are columbamine and O 2 , whereas its two products are berberine and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on X-H and Y-H to form an X-Y bond with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is columbamine:oxygen oxidoreductase (cyclizing) . This enzyme is also called berberine synthase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i . It employs one cofactor , iron .  References     "  Category:EC 1.21.3  Category:Iron enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
