Augmented Dickey–Fuller test

In statistics and econometrics, an augmented Dickey–Fuller test (ADF) is a test for a unit root in a time series sample. It is an augmented version of the Dickey–Fuller test for a larger and more complicated set of time series models. The augmented Dickey–Fuller (ADF) statistic, used in the test, is a negative number. The more negative it is, the stronger the rejection of the hypothesis that there is a unit root at some level of confidence.1
Testing procedure
The testing procedure for the ADF test is the same as for the Dickey–Fuller test but it is applied to the model



where 
 
 
 
  is a constant, 
 
 
 
  the coefficient on a time trend and 
 
 
 
  the lag order of the autoregressive process. Imposing the constraints 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  corresponds to modelling a random walk and using the constraint 
 
 
 
  corresponds to modelling a random walk with a drift. Consequently, there are three main versions of the test, analogous to the ones discussed on Dickey–Fuller test (see that page for a discussion on dealing with uncertainty about including the intercept and deterministic time trend terms in the test equation.)
By including lags of the order p the ADF formulation allows for higher-order autoregressive processes. This means that the lag length p has to be determined when applying the test. One possible approach is to test down from high orders and examine the t-values on coefficients. An alternative approach is to examine information criteria such as the Akaike information criterion, Bayesian information criterion or the Hannan–Quinn information criterion.
The unit root test is then carried out under the null hypothesis 
 
 
 
  against the alternative hypothesis of 
 
 
 
  Once a value for the test statistic



is computed it can be compared to the relevant critical value for the Dickey–Fuller Test. If the test statistic is less (this test is non symmetrical so we do not consider an absolute value) than the (larger negative) critical value, then the null hypothesis of 
 
 
 
  is rejected and no unit root is present.
Intuition
The intuition behind the test is that if the series is integrated then the lagged level of the series (
 
 
 
 ) will provide no relevant information in predicting the change in 
 
 
 
  besides the one obtained in the lagged changes (
 
 
 
 ). In this case the 
 
 
 
  null hypothesis is not rejected.
Examples
A model that includes a constant and a time trend is estimated using sample of 50 observations and yields the 
 
 
 
  statistic of −4.57. This is more negative than the tabulated critical value of −3.50, so at the 95 per cent level the null hypothesis of a unit root will be rejected.

Alternatives
There are alternative unit root tests such as the Phillips–Perron test or the ADF-GLS procedure developed by Elliott, Rothenberg and Stock (1996).3
