   √âtale morphism      √âtale morphism   In algebraic geometry , an √©tale morphism () is a morphism of schemes that is formally √©tale and locally of finite presentation. This is an algebraic analogue of the notion of a local isomorphism in the complex analytic topology. They satisfy the hypotheses of the implicit function theorem , but because open sets in the Zariski topology are so large, they are not necessarily local isomorphisms. Despite this, √©tale maps retain many of the properties of local analytic isomorphisms, and are useful in defining the algebraic fundamental group and the √©tale topology .  The word √©tale is a French adjective , which means "slack", as in "slack tide", or, figuratively, calm, immobile, something left to settle. 1  Definition  Let    œï  :   R  ‚Üí  S      normal-:  œï   normal-‚Üí  R  S     \phi:R\to S   be a ring homomorphism . This makes   S   S   S   an   R   R   R   -algebra. Choose a monic polynomial    f   f   f   in    R   [  x  ]       R   delimited-[]  x     R[x]   and a polynomial   g   g   g   in    R   [  x  ]       R   delimited-[]  x     R[x]   such that the derivative     f  ‚Ä≤     superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤    f^{\prime}   of   f   f   f   is a unit in     (     R   [  x  ]    /  f   R   [  x  ]    )   g     subscript        R   delimited-[]  x    f   R   delimited-[]  x    g    (R[x]/fR[x])_{g}   . We say that   œï   œï   \phi   is standard √©tale if   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   can be chosen so that   S   S   S   is isomorphic as an   R   R   R   -algebra to     (     R   [  x  ]    /  f   R   [  x  ]    )   g     subscript        R   delimited-[]  x    f   R   delimited-[]  x    g    (R[x]/fR[x])_{g}   and   œï   œï   \phi   is the canonical map.  Let    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be a morphism of schemes . We say that   f   f   f   is √©tale if it has any of the following equivalent properties:      f   f   f   is flat and unramified . 2     f   f   f   is a smooth morphism and unramified. 3     f   f   f   is flat, locally of finite presentation , and for every   y   y   y   in   Y   Y   Y   , the fiber     f   -  1     (  y  )        superscript  f    1    y    f^{-1}(y)   is the disjoint union of points, each of which is the spectrum of a finite separable field extension of the residue field    Œ∫   (  y  )       Œ∫  y    \kappa(y)   . 4     f   f   f   is flat, locally of finite presentation, and for every   y   y   y   in   Y   Y   Y   and every algebraic closure    k  ‚Ä≤     superscript  k  normal-‚Ä≤    k^{\prime}   of the residue field    Œ∫   (  y  )       Œ∫  y    \kappa(y)   , the geometric fiber      f   -  1     (  y  )     ‚äó   Œ∫   (  y  )      k  ‚Ä≤       subscript  tensor-product    Œ∫  y       superscript  f    1    y    superscript  k  normal-‚Ä≤     f^{-1}(y)\otimes_{\kappa(y)}k^{\prime}   is the disjoint union of points, each of which is isomorphic to    Spec   k  ‚Ä≤       Spec   superscript  k  normal-‚Ä≤     \mbox{Spec }k^{\prime}   . 5     f   f   f   is a smooth morphism of relative dimension zero. 6     f   f   f   is a smooth morphism and a locally quasi-finite morphism . 7     f   f   f   is locally of finite presentation and is locally a standard √©tale morphism, that is,  For every   x   x   x   in   X   X   X   , let    y  =   f   (  x  )        y    f  x     y=f(x)   . Then there is an open affine neighborhood  of   y   y   y   and an open affine neighborhood  of   x   x   x   such that  is contained in  and such that the ring homomorphism  induced by   f   f   f   is standard √©tale. 8       f   f   f   is locally of finite presentation and is formally √©tale . 9     f   f   f   is locally of finite presentation and is formally √©tale for maps from local rings, that is:  Let A be a local ring and J be an ideal of A such that 0}} . Set  and Spec A / J }} , and let be the canonical closed immersion. Let z denote the closed point of Z 0 . Let  and be morphisms such that  h ( i ( z ))}} . Then there exists a unique Y -morphism  such that  g 0 }} . 10     Assume that   Y   Y   Y   is locally noetherian and f is locally of finite type. For   x   x   x   in   X   X   X   , let    y  =   f   (  x  )        y    f  x     y=f(x)   and let      ùí™  ^    Y  ,  y    ‚Üí    ùí™  ^    X  ,  x       normal-‚Üí   subscript   normal-^  ùí™    Y  y     subscript   normal-^  ùí™    X  x      \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{Y,y}\to\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,x}   be the induced map on completed local rings. Then the following are equivalent:      f   f   f   is √©tale.  For every   x   x   x   in   X   X   X   , the induced map on completed local rings is formally √©tale for the adic topology. 11  For every   x   x   x   in   X   X   X   ,     ùí™  ^    X  ,  x      subscript   normal-^  ùí™    X  x     \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,x}   is a free     ùí™  ^    Y  ,  y      subscript   normal-^  ùí™    Y  y     \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{Y,y}   -module and the fiber       ùí™  ^    X  ,  x    /   m  y      ùí™  ^    X  ,  x           subscript   normal-^  ùí™    X  x     subscript  m  y     subscript   normal-^  ùí™    X  x      \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,x}/m_{y}\hat{\mathcal{O}}_{X,x}   is a field which is a finite separable field extension of the residue field    Œ∫   (  y  )       Œ∫  y    \kappa(y)   . 12 (Here    m  y     subscript  m  y    m_{y}   is the maximal ideal of     ùí™  ^    Y  ,  y      subscript   normal-^  ùí™    Y  y     \hat{\mathcal{O}}_{Y,y}   .)  f is formally √©tale for maps of local rings with the following additional properties. The local ring A may be assumed Artinian. If m is the maximal ideal of A , then J may be assumed to satisfy . Finally, the morphism on residue fields  may be assumed to be an isomorphism. 13   If in addition all the maps on residue fields     Œ∫   (  y  )    ‚Üí   Œ∫   (  x  )       normal-‚Üí    Œ∫  y     Œ∫  x     \kappa(y)\to\kappa(x)   are isomorphisms, or if    Œ∫   (  y  )       Œ∫  y    \kappa(y)   is separably closed, then   f   f   f   is √©tale if and only if for every   x   x   x   in   X   X   X   , the induced map on completed local rings is an isomorphism. 14  Examples of √©tale morphisms  Any open immersion is √©tale because it is locally an isomorphism.  Morphisms induced by finite separable field extensions are √©tale.  Any ring homomorphism of the form    R  ‚Üí  S  =    R    [   x  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   ]   g    /   (   f  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   f  n   )         normal-‚Üí  R  S           R   subscript    subscript  x  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n    g      subscript  f  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  f  n        R\to S=R[x_{1},\ldots,x_{n}]_{g}/(f_{1},\ldots,f_{n})   , where all the    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   are polynomials, and where the Jacobian determinant    det   (    ‚àÇ   f  i    /   ‚àÇ   x  j     )            subscript  f  i       subscript  x  j       \det(\partial f_{i}/\partial x_{j})   is a unit in   S   S   S   , is √©tale.  Expanding upon the previous example, suppose that we have a morphism   f   f   f   of smooth complex algebraic varieties. Since   f   f   f   is given by equations, we can interpret it as a map of complex manifolds. Whenever the Jacobian of   f   f   f   is nonzero,   f   f   f   is a local isomorphism of complex manifolds by the implicit function theorem . By the previous example, having non-zero Jacobian is the same as being √©tale.  Let    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   be a dominant morphism of finite type with X , Y locally noetherian, irreducible and Y normal. If f is unramified , then it is √©tale. 15  For a field K , any K -algebra A is necessarily flat. Therefore, A is an etale algebra if and only if it is unramified, which is also equivalent to        A   ‚äó  K    K  ¬Ø    ‚âÖ    K  ¬Ø   ‚äï  ‚Ä¶  ‚äï   K  ¬Ø     ,        subscript  tensor-product  K   A   normal-¬Ø  K     direct-sum   normal-¬Ø  K   normal-‚Ä¶   normal-¬Ø  K      A\otimes_{K}\bar{K}\cong\bar{K}\oplus...\oplus\bar{K},   where    K  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  K    \bar{K}   is the separable closure of the field K and the right hand side is a finite direct sum, all of whose summands are    K  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  K    \bar{K}   . This characterization of etale K -algebras is a stepping stone in reinterpreting classical Galois theory (see Grothendieck's Galois theory ).  Properties of √©tale morphisms   √âtale morphisms are preserved under composition and base change.  √âtale morphisms are local on the source and on the base. In other words,    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is √©tale if and only if for each covering of   X   X   X   by open subschemes the restriction of   f   f   f   to each of the open subschemes of the covering is √©tale, and also if and only if for each cover of   Y   Y   Y   by open subschemes the induced morphisms     f   (  U  )    :    X   √ó  Y   U   ‚Üí  U      normal-:   subscript  f  U    normal-‚Üí    subscript   Y   X  U   U     f_{(U)}:X\times_{Y}U\to U   is √©tale for each subscheme   U   U   U   of the covering. In particular, it is possible to test the property of being √©tale on open affines    V  =   Spec   (  B  )    ‚Üí  U  =   Spec   (  A  )          V   Spec  B     normal-‚Üí    U        Spec  A      V=\operatorname{Spec}(B)\to U=\operatorname{Spec}(A)   .  The product of a finite family of √©tale morphisms is √©tale.  Given a finite family of morphisms    {   f  Œ±   :    X  Œ±   ‚Üí  Y   }     conditional-set   subscript  f  Œ±    normal-‚Üí   subscript  X  Œ±   Y     \{f_{\alpha}:X_{\alpha}\to Y\}   , the disjoint union     ‚àê   f  Œ±    :    ‚àê   X  Œ±    ‚Üí  Y      normal-:   coproduct   subscript  f  Œ±     normal-‚Üí   coproduct   subscript  X  Œ±    Y     \coprod f_{\alpha}:\coprod X_{\alpha}\to Y   is √©tale if and only if each    f  Œ±     subscript  f  Œ±    f_{\alpha}   is √©tale.  Let    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   and    g  :   Y  ‚Üí  Z      normal-:  g   normal-‚Üí  Y  Z     g:Y\to Z   , and assume that   g   g   g   is unramified and    g  f      g  f    gf   is √©tale. Then   f   f   f   is √©tale. In particular, if   X   X   X   and    X  ‚Ä≤     superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤    X^{\prime}   are √©tale over   Y   Y   Y   , then any   Y   Y   Y   -morphism between   X   X   X   and    X  ‚Ä≤     superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤    X^{\prime}   is √©tale.  Quasi-compact √©tale morphisms are quasi-finite .  A morphism    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is an open immersion if and only if it is √©tale and radicial . 16  If    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is √©tale and surjective, then     dim  X   =   dim  Y        dimension  X    dimension  Y     \dim X=\dim Y   (finite or otherwise).   √âtale morphisms and the inverse function theorem  As said in the introduction, √©tale morphisms   f : X ‚Üí Y    are the algebraic counterpart of local diffeomorphisms . More precisely, a morphism between smooth varieties is √©tale at a point iff the differential between the corresponding tangent spaces is an isomorphism. This is in turn precisely the condition needed to ensure that a map between manifolds is a local diffeomorphism, i.e. for any point y ‚àà Y , there is an open neighborhood U of x such that the restriction of f to U is a diffeomorphism. This conclusion does not hold in algebraic geometry, because the topology is too coarse. For example, consider the projection f of the parabola   y = x 2    to the y -axis. This morphism is √©tale at every point except the origin (0, 0), because the differential is given by 2 x , which does not vanish at these points.  However, there is no ( Zariski- )local inverse of f , just because the square root is not an algebraic map , not being given by polynomials. However, there is a remedy for this situation, using the √©tale topology. The precise statement is as follows: if    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   is √©tale and quasi-compact, then for any point y lying in f ( X ), there is an √©tale morphism V ‚Üí Y containing y in its image ( V can be thought of as an √©tale open neighborhood of y ), such that when we base change f to V , then     X   √ó  Y   V   ‚Üí  V     normal-‚Üí    subscript   Y   X  V   V    X\times_{Y}V\to V   (the first member would be the pre-image of V by f if V were a Zariski open neighborhood) is a finite disjoint union of open subsets isomorphic to V . In other words, √©tale-locally in Y , the morphism f is a topological finite cover.  For a smooth morphism    f  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f:X\to Y   of relative dimension n , √©tale-locally in X and in Y , f is an open immersion into an affine space    ùî∏  Y  n     subscript   superscript  ùî∏  n   Y    \mathbb{A}^{n}_{Y}   . This is the √©tale analogue version of the structure theorem on submersions .  References  Bibliography         J. S. Milne (2008).
