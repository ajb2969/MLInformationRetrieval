   Shift operator      Shift operator   In mathematics , and in particular functional analysis , the shift operator or translation operator is an operator that takes a function    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   to its translation     f   (   x  +  a   )       f    x  a     f(x+a)   . 1 In time series analysis , the shift operator is called the lag operator .  Shift operators are examples of linear operators , important for their simplicity and natural occurrence. The shift operator action on functions of a real variable plays an important role in harmonic analysis , for example, it appears in the definitions of almost periodic functions , positive definite functions , and convolution . 2 Shifts of sequences (functions of an integer variable) appear in diverse areas such as Hardy spaces , the theory of abelian varieties , and the theory of symbolic dynamics , for which the baker's map is an explicit representation.  Definition  Functions of a real variable  The shift operator (    t  ‚àà  ùêë      t  normal-‚àà  ùêë    t‚àà\mathbf{R}   ) takes a function   f   f   f   on R to its translation ,         f  t    (  x  )    =   f   (   x  +  t   )     .         subscript  f  t   x     f    x  t      f_{t}(x)=f(x+t)~{}.     A practical representation of the linear operator in terms of the plain derivative was introduced by Lagrange ,        T  t   =    e   t   d   d  x        ,       superscript  T  t    superscript  e    t    d    d  x        T^{t}=e^{t\frac{d}{dx}}~{},   which may be interpreted operationally through its formal Taylor expansion in t ; and whose action on the monomial x n is evident by the binomial theorem , and thus on all series in x . 3  Sequences  The left shift operator acts on one-sided infinite sequence of numbers by       S  *   :    (   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  ‚Ä¶  )   ‚Ü¶   (   a  2   ,   a  3   ,   a  4   ,  ‚Ä¶  )       normal-:   superscript  S     maps-to    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-‚Ä¶     subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3    subscript  a  4   normal-‚Ä¶      S^{*}:(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots)\mapsto(a_{2},a_{3},a_{4},\ldots)     and on two-sided infinite sequences by       T  :     (   a  k   )    k  =   -  ‚àû    ‚àû   ‚Ü¶    (   a   k  +  1    )    k  =   -  ‚àû    ‚àû     .     normal-:  T   maps-to   superscript   subscript   subscript  a  k     k           superscript   subscript   subscript  a    k  1      k             T:(a_{k})_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\mapsto(a_{k+1})_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}.     The right shift operator acts on one-sided infinite sequence of numbers by      S  :    (   a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,  ‚Ä¶  )   ‚Ü¶   (  0  ,   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  ‚Ä¶  )       normal-:  S   maps-to    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-‚Ä¶    0   subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-‚Ä¶      S:(a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},\ldots)\mapsto(0,a_{1},a_{2},\ldots)     and on two-sided infinite sequences by        T   -  1    :     (   a  k   )    k  =   -  ‚àû    ‚àû   ‚Ü¶    (   a   k  -  1    )    k  =   -  ‚àû    ‚àû     .     normal-:   superscript  T    1     maps-to   superscript   subscript   subscript  a  k     k           superscript   subscript   subscript  a    k  1      k             T^{-1}:(a_{k})_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}\mapsto(a_{k-1})_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}.     The right and left shift operators acting on two-sided infinite sequences are called bilateral shifts.  Abelian groups  In general, if   f   f   f   is a function on an Abelian group    G   G   G   , and   g   g   g   is an element of   G   G   G   , the shift operator maps   f   f   f   to         f  g    (  h  )    =   f   (   g  +  h   )     .         subscript  f  g   h     f    g  h      f_{g}(h)=f(g+h).    4  Properties of the shift operator  The shift operator acting on real- or complex-valued functions or sequences is a linear operator which preserves most of the standard norms which appear in functional analysis. Therefore it is usually a continuous operator with norm one.  Action on Hilbert spaces  The shift operator acting on two-sided sequences is a unitary operator on . The shift operator acting on functions of a real variable is a unitary operator on .  In both cases, the (left) shift operator satisfies the following commutation relation with the Fourier transform:        ‚Ñ±   T  t    =    M  t   ‚Ñ±    ,        ‚Ñ±   superscript  T  t       superscript  M  t   ‚Ñ±     \mathcal{F}T^{t}=M^{t}\mathcal{F},     where is the multiplication operator by    e  x  p   (   i  t  x   )       e  x  p    i  t  x     exp(itx)   . Therefore the spectrum of is the unit circle.  The one-sided shift   S   S   S   acting on is a proper isometry with range equal to all vectors which vanish in the first coordinate . The operator S is a compression of T ‚àí1 , in the sense that         T   -  1    y   =   S  x  for each  x   ‚àà    ‚Ñì  2    (  ‚Ñï  )     ,           superscript  T    1    y     S  x  for each  x           superscript  normal-‚Ñì  2   ‚Ñï      T^{-1}y=Sx\text{ for each }x\in\ell^{2}(\mathbb{N}),\,     where   y   y   y   is the vector in with = for    i  ‚â•   0      i  normal-‚â•  normal-  0    i‚â•¬†0   and =   0   0    for   Œ¶   normal-Œ¶   Œ¶     The spectrum of S is the unit disk. The shift S is one example of a Fredholm operator ; it has Fredholm index¬†‚àí1.  Generalisation  Jean Delsarte introduced the notion of generalised shift operator (also called generalised displacement operator ); it was further developed by Boris Levitan . 5 6 7  A family of operators  acting on a space   X   X   X   of functions from a set   ùêÇ   ùêÇ   \mathbf{C}   to    e  ‚àà  X      e  normal-‚àà  X    e‚ààX   is called a family of generalised shift operators if the following properties hold:   Associativity: let = . Then = .  There exists   ùêó   ùêó   \mathbf{X}   such that is the identity operator.   In this case, the set $\mathbf{ X } $ is called a hypergroup .
