   N-acetylhexosamine 1-dehydrogenase      N-acetylhexosamine 1-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a N-acetylhexosamine 1-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-acetyl-D-glucosaminate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are N-acetyl-D-glucosaminate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acetyl-D-hexosamine:NAD + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include N-acetylhexosamine dehydrogenase , and N-acetyl-D-hexosamine dehydrogenase .
