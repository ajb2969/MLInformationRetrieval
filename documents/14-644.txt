   Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity      Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity   The R=T model , 1 also known as Jackiw – Teitelboim gravity is a theory of gravity with dilaton coupling in one spatial and one time dimension. It should not be confused 2 3 with the CGHS model or Liouville gravity . The action is given by      S  =    1  κ    ∫    d  2    x     -  g     [     -   R  Φ    -    1  2    g   μ  ν      ∇  μ   Φ     ∇  ν   Φ    -  Λ   +   κ   ℒ  mat     ]          S      1  κ        superscript  d  2   x      g     delimited-[]          R  normal-Φ        1  2    superscript  g    μ  ν      subscript  normal-∇  μ   normal-Φ     subscript  normal-∇  ν   normal-Φ    normal-Λ     κ   subscript  ℒ  mat           S=\frac{1}{\kappa}\int d^{2}x\,\sqrt{-g}\left[-R\Phi-\frac{1}{2}g^{\mu\nu}%
 \nabla_{\mu}\Phi\nabla_{\nu}\Phi-\Lambda+\kappa\mathcal{L}_{\text{mat}}\right]   where Φ is the dilaton,    ∇  μ     subscript  normal-∇  μ    \nabla_{\mu}   denotes the covariant derivative and the equation of motion is       R  -  Λ   =   κ  T         R  normal-Λ     κ  T     R-\Lambda=\kappa T   The metric in this case is more amenable to analytical solutions than the general 3+1D case. For example, in 1+1D, the metric for the case of two mutually interacting bodies can be solved exactly in terms of the Lambert W function , even with an additional electromagnetic field (see quantum gravity and references for details).
