Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity

The R=T model,1 also known as Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity is a theory of gravity with dilaton coupling in one spatial and one time dimension. It should not be confused23 with the CGHS model or Liouville gravity. The action is given by


 
  where Φ is the dilaton, 
 
 
 
  denotes the covariant derivative and the equation of motion is


 
  The metric in this case is more amenable to analytical solutions than the general 3+1D case. For example, in 1+1D, the metric for the case of two mutually interacting bodies can be solved exactly in terms of the Lambert W function, even with an additional electromagnetic field (see quantum gravity and references for details).
