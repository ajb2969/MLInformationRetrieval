   Self-similarity      Self-similarity   __NOTOC__  In mathematics , a self-similar object is exactly or approximately similar to a part of itself (i.e. the whole has the same shape as one or more of the parts). Many objects in the real world, such as coastlines , are statistically self-similar: parts of them show the same statistical properties at many scales. 1 Self-similarity is a typical property of fractals . Scale invariance is an exact form of self-similarity where at any magnification there is a smaller piece of the object that is similar to the whole. For instance, a side of the Koch snowflake is both symmetrical and scale-invariant; it can be continually magnified 3x without changing shape. The non-trivial similarity evident in fractals is distinguished by their fine structure, or detail on arbitrarily small scales. As a counterexample , whereas any portion of a straight line may resemble the whole, further detail is not revealed.  Definition  A compact  topological space  X is self-similar if there exists a finite set  S indexing a set of non- surjective  homeomorphisms     {   f  s   :   s  ‚àà  S   }     conditional-set   subscript  f  s     s  S     \{f_{s}:s\in S\}   for which      X  =    ‚ãÉ   s  ‚àà  S      f  s    (  X  )         X    subscript     s  S       subscript  f  s   X      X=\bigcup_{s\in S}f_{s}(X)     If    X  ‚äÇ  Y      X  Y    X\subset Y   , we call X self-similar if it is the only non-empty  subset of Y such that the equation above holds for    {   f  s   :   s  ‚àà  S   }     conditional-set   subscript  f  s     s  S     \{f_{s}:s\in S\}   . We call      ùîè  =   (  X  ,  S  ,   {   f  s   :   s  ‚àà  S   }   )       ùîè   X  S   conditional-set   subscript  f  s     s  S       \mathfrak{L}=(X,S,\{f_{s}:s\in S\})     a self-similar structure . The homeomorphisms may be iterated , resulting in an iterated function system . The composition of functions creates the algebraic structure of a monoid . When the set S has only two elements, the monoid is known as the dyadic monoid . The dyadic monoid can be visualized as an infinite binary tree ; more generally, if the set S has p elements, then the monoid may be represented as a p-adic tree.  The automorphisms of the dyadic monoid is the modular group ; the automorphisms can be pictured as hyperbolic rotations of the binary tree.  A more general notion than self-similarity is Self-affinity .  Examples    The Mandelbrot set is also self-similar around Misiurewicz points .  Self-similarity has important consequences for the design of computer networks, as typical network traffic has self-similar properties. For example, in teletraffic engineering , packet switched data traffic patterns seem to be statistically self-similar. 2 This property means that simple models using a Poisson distribution are inaccurate, and networks designed without taking self-similarity into account are likely to function in unexpected ways.  Similarly, stock market movements are described as displaying self-affinity , i.e. they appear self-similar when transformed via an appropriate affine transformation for the level of detail being shown. 3  Andrew Lo describes stock market log return self-similarity in econometrics . 4  Finite subdivision rules are a powerful technique for building self-similar sets, including the Cantor set and the Sierpinski triangle .  (Figure)  A triangle subdivided repeatedly using barycentric subdivision . The complement of the large circles is becoming a Sierpinski carpet   In nature  Self-similarity can be found in nature, as well. To the right is a mathematically generated, perfectly self-similar image of a fern , which bears a marked resemblance to natural ferns. Other plants, such as Romanesco broccoli , exhibit strong self-similarity.  In music   A Shepard tone is self-similar in the frequency or wavelength domains.  The Danish  composer  Per N√∏rg√•rd has made use of a self-similar integer sequence named the 'infinity series' in much of his music.
