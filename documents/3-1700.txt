   Continuity correction      Continuity correction   In probability theory , a continuity correction is an adjustment that is made when a discrete distribution is approximated by a continuous distribution.  Examples  Binomial  If a random variable  X has a binomial distribution with parameters n and p , i.e., X is distributed as the number of "successes" in n independent Bernoulli trials with probability p of success on each trial, then  $$P(X\leq x) = P(X for any ''x'' ∈ {0, 1, 2, ... ''n''}.  If ''np'' and ''np''(1 − ''p'') are large (sometimes taken to mean ≥ 5), then the probability above is fairly well approximated by
 
 : P(Y\leq x+1/2)$$  where Y is a normally distributed random variable with the same expected value and the same variance as X , i.e., E( Y ) = np and var( Y ) = np (1 − p ). This addition of 1/2 to x is a continuity correction.  Poisson  A continuity correction can also be applied when other discrete distributions supported on the integers are approximated by the normal distribution. For example, if X has a Poisson distribution with expected value λ then the variance of X is also λ, and  $$P(X\leq x)=P(X if ''Y'' is normally distributed with expectation and variance both λ.
 
 ==Applications==
 Before the ready availability of [[statistical software]] having the ability to evaluate probability distribution functions accurately, continuity corrections played an important role in the practical application of [[statistical hypothesis test|statistical tests]] in which the test statistic has a discrete distribution: it was a special importance for manual calculations. A particular example of this is the [[binomial test]], involving the [[binomial distribution]], as in [[checking whether a coin is fair]]. Where extreme accuracy is not necessary, computer calculations for some ranges of parameters may still rely on using continuity corrections to improve accuracy while retaining simplicity.
