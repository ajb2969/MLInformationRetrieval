   Index set (recursion theory)      Index set (recursion theory)   In the field of recursion theory , index sets describe classes of partial recursive functions , specifically they give all indices of functions in that class according to a fixed enumeration of partial recursive functions (a Gödel numbering ).  Definition  Fix an enumeration of all partial recursive functions, or equivalently of recursively enumerable sets whereby the e th such set is    W  e     subscript  W  e    W_{e}   and the e th such function (whose domain is    W  e     subscript  W  e    W_{e}   ) is    ϕ  e     subscript  ϕ  e    \phi_{e}   .  Let   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   be a class of partial recursive functions. If    A  =   {  x  :    ϕ  x   ∈  𝒜   }       A   conditional-set  x     subscript  ϕ  x   𝒜      A=\{x:\phi_{x}\in\mathcal{A}\}   then   A   A   A   is the index set of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   . In general   A   A   A   is an index set if for every     x  ,  y   ∈  ℕ       x  y   ℕ    x,y\in\mathbb{N}   with     ϕ  x   ≃   ϕ  y      similar-to-or-equals   subscript  ϕ  x    subscript  ϕ  y     \phi_{x}\simeq\phi_{y}   (i.e. they index the same function), we have     x  ∈  A   ↔   y  ∈  A      normal-↔    x  A     y  A     x\in A\leftrightarrow y\in A   . Intuitively, these are the sets of natural numbers that we describe only with reference to the functions they index.  Index sets and Rice's theorem  Most index sets are incomputable (non-recursive) aside from two trivial exceptions. This is stated in Rice's theorem :   Let   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   be a class of partial recursive functions with index set   C   C   C   . Then   C   C   C   is recursive if and only if   C   C   C   is empty, or   C   C   C   is all of   ω   ω   \omega   .   where   ω   ω   \omega   is the set of natural numbers , including zero .  Rice's theorem says "any nontrivial property of partial recursive functions is undecidable" 1  Notes  References      "  Category:Computability theory     ; page 151 ↩
