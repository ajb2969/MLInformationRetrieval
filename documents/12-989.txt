Index set (recursion theory)

In the field of recursion theory, index sets describe classes of partial recursive functions, specifically they give all indices of functions in that class according to a fixed enumeration of partial recursive functions (a GÃ¶del numbering).
Definition
Fix an enumeration of all partial recursive functions, or equivalently of recursively enumerable sets whereby the eth such set is 
 
 
 
  and the eth such function (whose domain is 
 
 
 
 ) is 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a class of partial recursive functions. If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is the index set of 
 
 
 
 . In general 
 
 
 
  is an index set if for every 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  (i.e. they index the same function), we have 
 
 
 
 . Intuitively, these are the sets of natural numbers that we describe only with reference to the functions they index.
Index sets and Rice's theorem
Most index sets are incomputable (non-recursive) aside from two trivial exceptions. This is stated in Rice's theorem:

Let 
 
 
 
  be a class of partial recursive functions with index set 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is recursive if and only if 
 
 
 
  is empty, or 
 
 
 
  is all of 
 
 
 
 .

where 
 
 
 
  is the set of natural numbers, including zero.
Rice's theorem says "any nontrivial property of partial recursive functions is undecidable"1
