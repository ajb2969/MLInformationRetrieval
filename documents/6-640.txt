   Numbering (computability theory)      Numbering (computability theory)   In computability theory a numbering is the assignment of natural numbers to a set of objects such as functions, rational numbers , graphs , or words in some language . A numbering can be used to transfer the idea of computability and related concepts, which are originally defined on the natural numbers using computable functions , to these different types of objects.  Common examples of numberings include G√∂del numberings in first-order logic and admissible numberings of the set of partial computable functions.  Definition and examples  A numbering of a set    S    S   S\!   is a surjective  partial function from   ‚Ñï   ‚Ñï   \mathbb{N}   to S (Ershov 1999:477). The value of a numbering ŒΩ at a number i (if defined) is often written ŒΩ 'i'' instead of the usual    ŒΩ   (  i  )       ŒΩ  i    \nu(i)\!   .  For example, the set of all finite subsets of   ‚Ñï   ‚Ñï   \mathbb{N}   has a numbering Œ≥ in which     Œ≥   (  ‚àÖ  )    =  0        Œ≥    0    \gamma(\emptyset)=0   and     Œ≥   (   {   a  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   a  k   }   )    =    ‚àë   i  ‚â§  k     2   a  i           Œ≥    subscript  a  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  a  k       subscript     i  k     superscript  2   subscript  a  i       \gamma(\{a_{0},\ldots,a_{k}\})=\sum_{i\leq k}2^{a_{i}}   (Ershov 1999:477).  As a second example, a fixed G√∂del numbering    œÜ  i     subscript  œÜ  i    \varphi_{i}   of the computable partial functions can be used to define a numbering W of the recursively enumerable sets , by letting by W ( i ) be the domain of œÜ i .  Types of numberings  A numbering is total if it is a total function. If the domain of a partial numbering is recursively enumerable then there always exists an equivalent total numbering (equivalence of numberings is defined below).  A numbering Œ∑ is decidable if the set    {   (  x  ,  y  )   :    Œ∑   (  x  )    =   Œ∑   (  y  )     }     conditional-set   x  y       Œ∑  x     Œ∑  y      \{(x,y):\eta(x)=\eta(y)\}   is a decidable set.  A numbering Œ∑ is single-valued if Œ∑( x ) = Œ∑( y ) if and only if x = y ; in other words if Œ∑ is an injective function. A single-valued numbering of the set of partial computable functions is called a Friedberg numbering .  Comparison of numberings  There is a partial ordering on the set of all numberings. Let       ŒΩ  1   :  ‚äÜ  ‚Ñï  ‚Üí   S  1      fragments   subscript  ŒΩ  1   normal-:   N  normal-‚Üí   subscript  S  1     \nu_{1}:\subseteq\mathbb{N}\to S_{1}   and       ŒΩ  2   :  ‚äÜ  ‚Ñï  ‚Üí   S  2      fragments   subscript  ŒΩ  2   normal-:   N  normal-‚Üí   subscript  S  2     \nu_{2}:\subseteq\mathbb{N}\to S_{2}   be two numbering. Then    ŒΩ  1     subscript  ŒΩ  1    \nu_{1}   is reducible to    ŒΩ  2     subscript  ŒΩ  2    \nu_{2}   , written     ŒΩ  1   ‚â§   ŒΩ  2        subscript  ŒΩ  1    subscript  ŒΩ  2     \nu_{1}\leq\nu_{2}   , if         ‚àÉ  f   ‚àà     ùêè   (  1  )      ‚àÄ  i    ‚àà   Domain   (   ŒΩ  1   )     :     ŒΩ  1    (  i  )    =     ŒΩ  2   ‚àò  f    (  i  )      .     normal-:        f      superscript  ùêè  1    for-all  i           Domain   subscript  ŒΩ  1           subscript  ŒΩ  1   i        subscript  ŒΩ  2   f   i      \exists f\in\mathbf{P}^{(1)}\,\forall i\in\mathrm{Domain}(\nu_{1}):\nu_{1}(i)=%
 \nu_{2}\circ f(i).     If     ŒΩ  1   ‚â§   ŒΩ  2        subscript  ŒΩ  1    subscript  ŒΩ  2     \nu_{1}\leq\nu_{2}   and     ŒΩ  1   ‚â•   ŒΩ  2        subscript  ŒΩ  1    subscript  ŒΩ  2     \nu_{1}\geq\nu_{2}   then    ŒΩ  1     subscript  ŒΩ  1    \nu_{1}   is equivalent to    ŒΩ  2     subscript  ŒΩ  2    \nu_{2}   ; this is written     ŒΩ  1   ‚â°   ŒΩ  2        subscript  ŒΩ  1    subscript  ŒΩ  2     \nu_{1}\equiv\nu_{2}   .  Computable numberings  When the objects of the set S are sufficiently "constructive", it is common to look at numberings that can be effectively decoded (Ershov 1999:486). For example, if S consists of recursively enumerable sets, the numbering Œ∑ is computable if the set of pairs ( x , y ) where y ‚ààŒ∑( x ) is recursively enumerable. Similarly, a numbering g of partial functions is computable if the relation R ( x , y , z ) = "[ g ( x )]( y ) = z " is partial recursive (Ershov 1999:487).  A computable numbering is called principal if every computable numbering of the same set is reducible to it. Both the set of all r.e. subsets of   ‚Ñï   ‚Ñï   \mathbb{N}   and the set of all partial computable functions have principle numberings (Ershov 1999:487). A principle numbering of the set of partial recursive functions is known as an admissible numbering in the literature.
