   Harnack's inequality      Harnack's inequality  In ma thematics, Harnack's inequality is an inequality relating the values of a positive harmonic function at two points, introduced by .  and  generalized Harnack's inequality to solutions of elliptic or parabolic partial differential equations . Perelman 's solution of the Poincaré conjecture uses a version of the Harnack inequality, found by , for the Ricci flow . Harnack's inequality is used to prove Harnack's theorem about the convergence of sequences of harmonic functions. Harnack's inequality can also be used to show the interior regularity of weak solutions of partial differential equations.  The statement   Harnack's inequality applies to a non-negative function f defined on a closed ball in R n with radius R and centre x 0 . It states that, if f is continuous on the closed ball and harmonic on its interior, then for any point x with | x - x 0 | = r \displaystylef(x_0)\le f(x) \le {1+(r/R)\over [1-(r/R)]^{n-1}} f(x_0).}  In the plane R 2 ( n = 2) the inequality can be written:          R  -  r    R  +  r    f   (   x  0   )    ≤   f   (  x  )    ≤     R  +  r    R  -  r    f   (   x  0   )     .

For general domains   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   in    𝐑  n     superscript  𝐑  n    \mathbf{R}^{n}   the inequality can be stated as follows: If   ω   ω   \omega   is a bounded domain with     ω  ¯   ⊂  Ω       normal-¯  ω   normal-Ω    \bar{\omega}\subset\Omega   , then there is a constant   C   C   C   such that  for every twice differentiable, harmonic and nonnegative function    u   (  x  )       u  x    u(x)   . The constant   C   C   C   is independent of   u   u   u   ; it depends only on the domains   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   and   ω   ω   \omega   .  Proof of Harnack's inequality in a ball  By Poisson's formula        f   (  x  )    =    1   ω   n  -  1       ∫    |   y  -   x  0    |   =  R         R  2   -   r  2     R    |   x  -  y   |   n     ⋅  f    (  y  )   d  y      ,        f  x       1   subscript  ω    n  1       subscript         y   subscript  x  0     R       normal-⋅       superscript  R  2    superscript  r  2      R   superscript      x  y    n     f   y  d  y       \displaystyle{f(x)={1\over\omega_{n-1}}\int_{|y-x_{0}|=R}{R^{2}-r^{2}\over R|x%
 -y|^{n}}\cdot f(y)\,dy,}     where ω n − 1 is the area of the unit sphere in R n and r = | x - x 0 |.  Since        R  -  r   ≤   |   x  -  y   |   ≤   R  +  r    ,          R  r       x  y           R  r      \displaystyle{R-r\leq|x-y|\leq R+r,}     the kernel in the integrand satisfies         R  -  r    R    (   R  +  r   )    n  -  1      ≤     R  2   -   r  2     R    |   x  -  y   |   n     ≤    R  +  r    R    (   R  -  r   )    n  -  1       .            R  r     R   superscript    R  r     n  1           superscript  R  2    superscript  r  2      R   superscript      x  y    n              R  r     R   superscript    R  r     n  1         \displaystyle{{R-r\over R(R+r)^{n-1}}\leq{R^{2}-r^{2}\over R|x-y|^{n}}\leq{R+r%
 \over R(R-r)^{n-1}}.}     Harnack's inequality follows by substituting this inequality in the above integral and using the fact that the average of a harmonic function over a sphere equals it value at the center of the sphere:        f   (   x  0   )    =    1    R   n  -  1     ω   n  -  1        ∫    |   y  -   x  0    |   =  R     f   (  y  )   d  y      .        f   subscript  x  0        1     superscript  R    n  1     subscript  ω    n  1        subscript         y   subscript  x  0     R      f  y  d  y       \displaystyle{f(x_{0})={1\over R^{n-1}\omega_{n-1}}\int_{|y-x_{0}|=R}f(y)\,dy.}     Elliptic partial differential equations  For elliptic partial differential equations, Harnack's inequality states that the supremum of a positive solution in some connected open region is bounded by some constant times the infimum, possibly with an added term containing a functional norm of the data:       sup  u   ≤   C   (    inf  u   +   ||  f  ||    )         supremum  u     C     infimum  u    norm  f       \sup u\leq C(\inf u+||f||)   The constant depends on the ellipticity of the equation and the connected open region.  Parabolic partial differential equations  There is a version of Harnack's inequality for linear parabolic PDEs such as heat equation .

Suppose that     u   (  t  ,  x  )    ∈    C  2    (    (  0  ,  T  )   ×  ℳ   )          u   t  x       superscript  C  2      0  T   ℳ      u(t,x)\in C^{2}((0,T)\times\mathcal{M})   is a solution of         ∂  u    ∂  t    -   ℒ  u    ≥  0            u     t      ℒ  u    0    \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}-\mathcal{L}u\geq 0   in     (  0  ,  T  )   ×  ℳ       0  T   ℳ    (0,T)\times\mathcal{M}     such that        u    (  t  ,  x  )    ≥  0        u   t  x    0    \quad u(t,x)\geq 0   in      (  0  ,  T  )   ×  ℳ   .       0  T   ℳ    \quad(0,T)\times\mathcal{M}.     Let   K   K   K   be a compact subset of   ℳ   ℳ   \mathcal{M}   and choose    τ  ∈   (  0  ,  T  )       τ   0  T     \tau\in(0,T)   . Then there exists a constant     C   >  0      C  0    \quad C>0   (depending only on   K   K   K   ,   τ   τ   \tau   and the coefficients of   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   ) such that, for each     t   ∈   (  τ  ,  T  )       t   τ  T     \quad t\in(\tau,T)   ,         sup  K    u   (   t  -  τ   ,  ⋅  )     ≤   C    inf  K    u   (  t  ,  ⋅  )       .        subscript  supremum  K     u     t  τ   normal-⋅       C    subscript  infimum  K     u   t  normal-⋅        \sup_{K}u(t-\tau,\cdot)\leq C\inf_{K}u(t,\cdot).\,     See also   Harnack's theorem  Harmonic function   References              L.
