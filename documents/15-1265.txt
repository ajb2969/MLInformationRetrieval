Cobalt-precorrin-7 (C15)-methyltransferase (decarboxylating)

Cobalt-precorrin-7 (C15)-methyltransferase (decarboxylating) (, CbiT) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-7 C15-methyltransferase (C-12-decarboxylating).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

cobalt-precorrin-7 + S-adenosyl-L-methionine

 
  cobalt-precorrin-8x + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + CO2


This enzyme catalyses both methylation at C-15 and decarboxylation of the C-12 acetate side chain of cobalt-precorrin-7.
