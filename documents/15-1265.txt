   Cobalt-precorrin-7 (C15)-methyltransferase (decarboxylating)      Cobalt-precorrin-7 (C15)-methyltransferase (decarboxylating)   Cobalt-precorrin-7 (C 15 )-methyltransferase (decarboxylating) (, CbiT ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:precorrin-7 C 15 -methyltransferase (C-12-decarboxylating) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   cobalt-precorrin-7 + S-adenosyl-L-methionine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cobalt-precorrin-8x + S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + CO 2    This enzyme catalyses both methylation at C-15 and decarboxylation of the C-12 acetate side chain of cobalt-precorrin-7.
