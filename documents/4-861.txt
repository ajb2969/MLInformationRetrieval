Complex Mexican hat wavelet

In applied mathematics, the complex Mexican hat wavelet is a low-oscillation, complex-valued, wavelet for the continuous wavelet transform. This wavelet is formulated in terms of its Fourier transform as the Hilbert analytic signal of the conventional Mexican hat wavelet:



Temporally, this wavelet can be expressed in terms of the error function, as:



This wavelet has 
 
 
asymptotic temporal decay in 
 
 
 
 , dominated by the discontinuity of the second derivative of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 .
This wavelet was proposed in 2002 by Addison et al.1 for applications requiring high temporal precision time-frequency analysis.
