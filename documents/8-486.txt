Stewart–Walker lemma

The Stewart–Walker lemma provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the linear perturbation of a tensor field to be gauge-invariant. 
 
 
if and only if one of the following holds
1. 
 
 

2. 
 
 
 
  is a constant scalar field
3. 
 
 
 
 
  is a linear combination of products of delta functions 
 
 

Derivation
A 1-parameter family of manifolds denoted by 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  has metric

 
 . These manifolds can be put together to form a 5-manifold 
 
 
 
 
 . A smooth curve 
 
 
 
  can be constructed through 
 
 
 
  with tangent 5-vector 
 
 
 
 , transverse to 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 
  is defined so that if 
 
 
 
  is the family of 1-parameter maps which map 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then a point 
 
 
 
  can be written as 
 
 
 
 
 . This also defines a pull back

 
  that maps a tensor field 
 
 
 
  back onto 
 
 
 
 . Given sufficient smoothness a Taylor expansion can be defined



 
 
  is the linear perturbation of 
 
 
 
 . However, since the choice of 
 
 
 
  is dependent on the choice of gauge another gauge can be taken. Therefore the differences in gauge become 
 
 
 
 . Picking a chart where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  which is a well defined vector in any 
 
 
 
  and gives the result



The only three possible ways this can be satisfied are those of the lemma.
