   Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem      Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem   The Denjoy–Carleman–Ahlfors theorem states that the number of asymptotic values attained by a non-constant entire function of order ρ on curves going outwards toward infinite absolute value is less than or equal to 2ρ. It was first conjectured by Arnaud Denjoy in 1907. 1  Torsten Carleman showed that the number of asymptotic values was less than or equal to (5/2)ρ in 1921. 2 In 1929 Lars Ahlfors confirmed Denjoy's conjecture of 2ρ. 3 Finally, in 1933, Carleman published a very short proof. 4  The use of the term "asymptotic value" does not mean that the ratio of that value to the value of the function approaches 1 (as in asymptotic analysis ) as one moves along a certain curve, but rather that the function value approaches the asymptotic value along the curve. For example, as one moves along the real axis toward negative infinity, the function    exp   (  z  )       z    \exp(z)   approaches zero, but the quotient    0  /   exp   (  z  )        0    z     0/\exp(z)   does not go to 1.  Examples  The function    exp   (  z  )       z    \exp(z)   is of order 1 and has only one asymptotic value, namely 0. The same is true of the function      sin   (  z  )    /  z   ,        z   z    \sin(z)/z,   but the asymptote is attained in two opposite directions.  A case where the number of asymptotic values is equal to 2ρ is the sine integral      Si   (  z  )    =    ∫  0  z       sin  ζ   ζ    d  ζ          Si  z     superscript   subscript   0   z         ζ   ζ   d  ζ      \text{Si}(z)=\int_{0}^{z}\frac{\sin\zeta}{\zeta}\,d\zeta   , a function of order 1 which goes to −π/2 along the real axis going toward negative infinity, and to +π/2 in the opposite direction.  The integral of the function      a   sin   (   z  2   )     /  z   +    b   sin   (   z  2   )     /   z  2            a     superscript  z  2     z       b     superscript  z  2      superscript  z  2      a\sin(z^{2})/z+b\sin(z^{2})/z^{2}   is an example of a function of order 2 with four asymptotic values (if b is not zero), approached as one goes outward from zero along the real and imaginary axes.  More generally,      f   (  z  )    =    ∫  0  z      sin   (   ζ  ρ   )     ζ  ρ    d  ζ     ,        f  z     superscript   subscript   0   z          superscript  ζ  ρ     superscript  ζ  ρ    d  ζ      f(z)=\int_{0}^{z}\frac{\sin(\zeta^{\rho})}{\zeta^{\rho}}d\zeta,   with ρ any positive integer, is of order ρ and has 2ρ asymptotic values.  It is clear that the theorem applies to polynomials only if they are not constant. A constant polynomial has 1 asymptotic value, but is of order 0.
