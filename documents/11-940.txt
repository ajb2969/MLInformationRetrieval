   Isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase      Isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase   In enzymology , an isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phenylacetyl-CoA + isopenicillin N + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + penicillin G + L-2-aminohexanedioate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are phenylacetyl-CoA , isopenicillin N , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are CoA , penicillin G , and L-2-aminohexanedioate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:isopenicillin N N-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include acyl-coenzyme A:isopenicillin N acyltransferase , and isopenicillin N:acyl-CoA: acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in hydrophobic penicillins biosynthesis .
