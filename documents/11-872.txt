Biphenyl synthase

In enzymology, a biphenyl synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

3 malonyl-CoA + benzoyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  4 CoA + 3,5-dihydroxybiphenyl + 4 CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and benzoyl-CoA, whereas its 3 products are CoA, 3,5-dihydroxybiphenyl, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:benzoyl-CoA malonyltransferase. This enzyme is also called BIS.
