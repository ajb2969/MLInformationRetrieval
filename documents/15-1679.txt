Pyrethroid hydrolase

Pyrethroid hydrolase (, pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase, pyrethroid-hydrolysing esterase, pyrethroid-hydrolyzing esterase, pyrethroid-selective esterase, pyrethroid-cleaving enzyme, permethrinase, PytH, EstP) is an enzyme with system name pyrethroid-ester hydrolase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

trans-permethrin + H2O 
 
 
 
  (3-phenoxyphenyl)methanol + (1S,3R)-3-(2,2-dichloroethenyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate
 

The enzyme is involved in degradation of pyrethroid pesticides.
