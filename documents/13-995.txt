   Triatomic molecule      Triatomic molecule    Triatomic molecules are molecules composed of three atoms , of either the same or different chemical elements . Examples include H 2 O , CO 2 (pictured) and HCN .  Molecular vibrations  The vibrational modes of a triatomic molecule can be determined in specific cases.  Symmetric linear molecules  A symmetric linear molecule ABA can perform:   Antisymmetric longitudinal vibrations with frequency        ω  a   =      k  1   M     m  A    m  B           subscript  ω  a          subscript  k  1   M      subscript  m  A    subscript  m  B        \omega_{a}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{1}M}{m_{A}m_{B}}}      Symmetric longitudinal vibrations with frequency        ω   s  1    =     k  1    m  A          subscript  ω    s  1         subscript  k  1    subscript  m  A       \omega_{s1}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{1}}{m_{A}}}      Symmetric transversal vibrations with frequency        ω   s  2    =     2   k  2   M     m  A    m  B           subscript  ω    s  2          2   subscript  k  2   M      subscript  m  A    subscript  m  B        \omega_{s2}=\sqrt{\frac{2k_{2}M}{m_{A}m_{B}}}   In the previous formulas, M is the total mass of the molecule, m A and m B are the masses of the elements A and B, k 1 and k 2 are the spring constants of the molecule along its axis and perpendicular to it.  Types  Homonuclear  Homonuclear triatomic molecules contain three of the same kind of atom. Ozone , O 3 is an example of a triatomic molecule with all atoms the same. Triatomic hydrogen , H 3 , is unstable and breaks up spontaneously. H 3 + , the trihydrogen cation is stable by itself and is symmetric. 4 He 3 , the helium trimer is only weakly bound by van der Waals force and is in a Efimov state . 1  Trisulfur (S 3 ) is analogous to ozone.
