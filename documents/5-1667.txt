Gilbert–Varshamov bound

In coding theory, the Gilbert–Varshamov bound (due to Edgar Gilbert1 and independently Rom Varshamov2) is a limit on the parameters of a (not necessarily linear) code. It is occasionally known as the Gilbert–Shannon–Varshamov bound (or the GSV bound), but the name "Gilbert–Varshamov bound" is by far the most popular. Varshamov proved this bound by using the probabilistic method for linear code. For more about that proof, see: GV-linear-code.
Statement of the bound
Let



denote the maximum possible size of a q-ary code 
 
 
 
  with length n and minimum Hamming weight d (a q-ary code is a code over the field

 
  of q elements).
Then:



Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  be a code of length 
 
 
 
  and minimum Hamming distance

 
  having maximal size:



Then for all 
 
 
 
 
  , there exists at least one codeword 
 
 
 
  such that the Hamming distance 
 
 
 
  between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  satisfies



since otherwise we could add x to the code whilst maintaining the code's minimum Hamming distance d – a contradiction on the maximality of 
 
 
 
 .
Hence the whole of 
 
 
 
  is contained in the union of all balls of radius d − 1 having their centre at some 
 
 
 
  :



Now each ball has size



since we may allow (or choose) up to 
 
 
 
  of the 
 
 
 
  components of a codeword to deviate (from the value of the corresponding component of the ball's centre) to one of 
 
 
 
  possible other values (recall: the code is q-ary: it takes values in 
 
 
 
 ). Hence we deduce



That is:



(using the fact
 
 
 
 ).
An improvement in the prime power case
For q a prime power, one can improve the bound to 
 
 
 
  where k is the greatest integer for which
