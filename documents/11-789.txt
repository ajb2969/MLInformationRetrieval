Succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase

In enzymology, a succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-succinyl-LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate + H2O 
 
 
 
  succinate + LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-succinyl-LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate and H2O, whereas its two products are succinate and LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-succinyl-LL-2,6-diaminoheptanedioate amidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called N-succinyl-L-alpha,epsilon-diaminopimelic acid deacylase. This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis.
