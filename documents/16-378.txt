M2-brane

In theoretical physics, an M2-brane, is a spatially extended mathematical object that appears in string theory and in related theories (e.g. M-theory, F-theory). In particular, it is a solution of eleven-dimensional supergravity which possesses a three-dimensional world volume.
Description
The M2-brane solution can be found1 by requiring 
 
 
 
  symmetry of the solution and solving the supergravity equations of motion with the p-brane ansatz. The solution is given by a metric and three-form gauge field which, in isotropic coordinates, can be written as


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the flat-space metric and the distinction has been made between world volume 
 
 
 
  and transverse 
 
 
 
  coordinates. The constant 
 
 
 
  is proportional to the charge of the brane which is given by the integral of 
 
 
 
  over the boundary of the transverse space of the brane.2
