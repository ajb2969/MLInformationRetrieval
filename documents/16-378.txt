   M2-brane      M2-brane   In theoretical physics , an M2-brane , is a spatially extended mathematical object that appears in string theory and in related theories (e.g. M-theory , F-theory ). In particular, it is a solution of eleven-dimensional supergravity which possesses a three-dimensional world volume .  Description  The M2-brane solution can be found 1 by requiring       (   P  o  i  n  c  a  r  e   )   3   ×  S   O   (  8  )          subscript    P  o  i  n  c  a  r  e   3   S   O  8    (Poincare)_{3}\times SO(8)   symmetry of the solution and solving the supergravity equations of motion with the p-brane ansatz. The solution is given by a metric and three- form gauge field which, in isotropic coordinates, can be written as      d   s   M  2   2       d   subscript   superscript  s  2     M  2      \displaystyle ds^{2}_{M2}   where   η   η   \eta   is the flat-space metric and the distinction has been made between world volume    x  μ     superscript  x  μ    x^{\mu}   and transverse    x  i     superscript  x  i    x^{i}   coordinates. The constant   q   q   q   is proportional to the charge of the brane which is given by the integral of   F   F   F   over the boundary of the transverse space of the brane. 2  See also   String theory  Membrane (M-theory)  M-theory   External links   http://www.superstringtheory.com/   References  "  Category:String theory  Category:Physical cosmology     K.
