   Growing degree-day      Growing degree-day   Growing degree days (GDD), also called growing degree units (GDUs), are a heuristic tool in phenology . GDD are a measure of heat accumulation used by horticulturists , gardeners , and farmers to predict plant and animal development rates such as the date that a flower will bloom, or a crop will reach maturity.  Introduction  In the absence of extreme conditions such as unseasonal drought or disease, plants grow in a cumulative stepwise manner which is strongly influenced by the ambient temperature. Growing degree days take aspects of local weather into account and allow gardeners to predict (or, in greenhouses , even to control) the plants’ pace toward maturity.  Unless stressed by other environmental factors like moisture, the development rate from emergence to maturity for many plants depends upon the daily air temperature. Because many developmental events of plants and insects depend on the accumulation of specific quantities of heat, it is possible to predict when these events should occur during a growing season regardless of differences in temperatures from year to year. Growing degrees (GDs) is defined as the number of temperature degrees above a certain threshold base temperature, which varies among crop species. The base temperature is that temperature below which plant growth is zero. GDs are calculated each day as maximum temperature plus the minimum temperature divided by 2 (or the mean temperature), minus the base temperature. GDUs are accumulated by adding each day’s GDs contribution as the season progresses.  GDUs can be used to: assess the suitability of a region for production of a particular crop; estimate the growth-stages of crops, weeds or even life stages of insects; predict maturity and cutting dates of forage crops; predict best timing of fertilizer or pesticide application; estimate the heat stress on crops; plan spacing of planting dates to produce separate harvest dates. Crop specific indices that employ separate equations for the influence of the daily minimum (nighttime) and the maximum (daytime) temperatures on growth are called crop heat units (CHUs).  GDD calculation  GDD are calculated by taking the average of the daily maximum and minimum temperatures compared to a base temperature, T base , (usually 10 °C). As an equation:        G  D  D   =      T  max   +   T  min    2   -   T  base     .        G  D  D          subscript  T  max    subscript  T  min    2    subscript  T  base      GDD=\frac{T_{\mathrm{max}}+T_{\mathrm{min}}}{2}-T_{\mathrm{base}}.     If the mean daily temperature is lower than the base temperature then GDD=0.  GDDs are typically measured from the winter low. Any temperature below T base is set to T base before calculating the average. Likewise, the maximum temperature is usually capped at 30 °C because most plants and insects do not grow any faster above that temperature. However, some warm temperate and tropical plants do have significant requirements for days above 30 °C to mature fruit or seeds.  For example, a day with a high of 23 °C and a low of 12 °C (and a base of 10 °C) would contribute 7.5 GDDs.         23  +  12   2   -  10   =  7.5            23  12   2   10   7.5    \frac{23+12}{2}-10=7.5     A day with a high of 13 °C and a low of 10 °C (and a base of 10 °C) would contribute 1.5 GDDs.         13  +  10   2   -  10   =  1.5            13  10   2   10   1.5    \frac{13+10}{2}-10=1.5     Plant development      Common name   Latin name   Number of growing degree days baseline 10 °C       Witch-hazel   Hamamelis spp.   begins flowering at <1 GDD     Red maple   Acer rubrum   begins flowering at 1-27 GDD     Forsythia   Forsythia spp.   begin flowering at 1-27 GDD     Sugar maple   Acer saccharum   begin flowering at 1-27 GDD     Norway maple   Acer platanoides   begins flowering at 30-50 GDD     White ash   Fraxinus americana   begins flowering at 30-50 GDD     Crabapple   Malus spp.   begins flowering at 50-80 GDD     Common Broom   Cytisus scoparius   begins flowering at 50-80 GDD     Horsechestnut   Aesculus hippocastanum   begin flowering at 80-110 GDD     Common lilac   Syringa vulgaris   begin flowering at 80-110 GDD     Beach plum   Prunus maritima   full bloom at 80-110 GDD     Black locust   Robinia pseudoacacia   begins flowering at 140-160 GDD     Catalpa   Catalpa speciosa   begins flowering at 250-330 GDD     Privet   Ligustrum spp.   begins flowering at 330-400 GDD     Elderberry   Sambucus canadensis   begins flowering at 330-400 GDD     Purple loosestrife   Lythrum salicaria   begins flowering at 400-450 GDD     Sumac   Rhus typhina   begins flowering at 450-500 GDD     Butterfly bush   Buddleia davidii   begins flowering at 550-650 GDD     Corn (maize)   Zea mays   800 to 1400 GDD to crop maturity     Dry beans   Phaseolus vulgaris   1100-1300 GDD to maturity depending on cultivar and soil conditions     Sugar Beet   Beta vulgaris   130 GDD to emergence and 1400-1500 GDD to maturity     Barley   Hordeum vulgare   125-162 GDD to emergence and 1290-1540 GDD to maturity     Wheat (Hard Red)   Triticum aestivum   143-178 GDD to emergence and 1550-1680 GDD to maturity (there may be confusion between Celsius and Fahrenheit, 1680 is probably Fahrenheit)     Oats   Avena sativa   1500-1750 GDD to maturity     European Corn Borer   Ostrinia nubilalis   207 - Emergence of first spring moths     Pest control  Insect development and growing degree days are also used by some farmers and horticulturalists to time their use of organic or biological pest control or other pest control methods so they are applying the procedure or treatment at the point that the pest is most vulnerable. For example:   Black cutworm larvae have grown large enough to start causing economic damage at 165 GDD  Azalea Lace Bug emerges at about 130 GDD  Boxwood leaf miner emerges at about 250 GDD   Honeybees  Several beekeepers are now researching the correlation between growing degree days-GDD and the lifecycle of a honeybee colony.  Baselines  10 °C is the most common base for GDD calculations, however, the optimal base is often determined experimentally based on the lifecycle of the plant or insect in question.   5.5 °C wheat , barley , rye , oats , flaxseed , lettuce , asparagus  6 °C Stalk Borer  7 °C Corn rootworm  8 °C sunflower , potato  9 °C Alfalfa weevil  10 °C maize (including sweet corn), sorghum , rice , soybeans , tomato , Black cutworm , European Corn Borer , Coffee (Jaramillo-Robledo & Guzman-Martinez published by Cenicafé ), standard baseline for insect and mite pests of woody plants  11 °C Green Cloverworm  12 °C many other crop calculations  30 °C the USDA measure heat zones in GDD above 30 °C; for many plants this is significant for seed maturation, e.g. reed ( Phragmites ) requires at least some days reaching this temperature to mature viable seeds   GDDs may be calculated using either Celsius or Fahrenheit, though they must be converted appropriately; 5 GDD C = 9 GDD F  See also   Degree day  Growing season  Heating degree day  Weather derivatives  Winkler scale  Phenology   References  Notes  Bibliography     External links   Growing Degree Days as a Method of Rating the Maturity of Corn Hybrids  Current year-to-date GDDs for selected US cities  a table of GDDs necessary for grapes  GDDs to various stages of maturity for selected crops  University of Massachusetts Amherst Extension, Integrated Pest management Tools, web site accessed Jan 2005  Online GDD calculator   "  Category:Climatology  Category:Horticulture and gardening  Category:Agricultural terminology  Category:Pest control  Category:Seasons  Category:Meteorological indices
