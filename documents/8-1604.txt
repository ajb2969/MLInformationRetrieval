Non-exact solutions in general relativity

Non-exact solutions in general relativity are solutions of Albert Einstein's field equations of general relativity which hold only approximately. These solutions are typically found by treating the gravitational field, 
 
 
 
 , as a background space-time, 
 
 
 
 , (which is usually an exact solution) plus some small perturbation, 
 
 
 
 . Then one is able to solve the Einstein field equations as a series in 
 
 
 
 , dropping higher order terms for simplicity.
A common example of this method results in the linearised Einstein field equations. In this case we expand the full space-time metric about the flat Minkowski metric,
