   Non-exact solutions in general relativity      Non-exact solutions in general relativity   Non-exact solutions in general relativity are solutions of Albert Einstein's field equations of general relativity which hold only approximately. These solutions are typically found by treating the gravitational field,   g   g   g   , as a background space-time,   Œ≥   Œ≥   \gamma   , (which is usually an exact solution) plus some small perturbation,   h   h   h   . Then one is able to solve the Einstein field equations as a series in   h   h   h   , dropping higher order terms for simplicity.  A common example of this method results in the linearised Einstein field equations . In this case we expand the full space-time metric about the flat Minkowski metric ,    Œ∑   Œº  ŒΩ      subscript  Œ∑    Œº  ŒΩ     \eta_{\mu\nu}   :         g   Œº  ŒΩ    =    Œ∑   Œº  ŒΩ    +   h   Œº  ŒΩ    +   ùí™   (   h  2   )          subscript  g    Œº  ŒΩ       subscript  Œ∑    Œº  ŒΩ     subscript  h    Œº  ŒΩ      ùí™   superscript  h  2       g_{\mu\nu}=\eta_{\mu\nu}+h_{\mu\nu}+\mathcal{O}(h^{2})   ,     and dropping all terms which are of second or higher order in   h   h   h   . 1  See also   Exact solutions in general relativity  Linearized gravity  Post-Newtonian expansion  Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism  Numerical relativity   References  "  Category:General relativity     ‚Ü©
