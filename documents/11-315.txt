Orbit (control theory)

The notion of orbit of a control system used in mathematical control theory is a particular case of the notion of orbit in group theory.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
  control system, where 
 
 
 
  belongs to a finite-dimensional manifold 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  belongs to a control set 
 
 
 
 . Consider the family 
 
 
 
  and assume that every vector field in 
 
 
 
  is complete. For every 
 
 
 
 
  and every real 
 
 
 
 , denote by 
 
 
 
  the flow of 
 
 
 
  at time 
 
 
 
 .
The orbit of the control system 
 
 
 
 
  through a point 
 
 
 
  is the subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  defined by




Remarks

The difference between orbits and attainable sets is that, whereas for attainable sets only forward-in-time motions are allowed, both forward and backward motions are permitted for orbits. In particular, if the family 
 
 
 
 
  is symmetric (i.e., 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 ), then orbits and attainable sets coincide.
The hypothesis that every vector field of 
 
 
 
  is complete simplifies the notations but can be dropped. In this case one has to replace flows of vector fields by local versions of them.
Orbit theorem (Nagano-Sussmann)
Each orbit 
 
 
 
  is an immersed submanifold of 
 
 
 
 
 .
The tangent space to the orbit 
 
 
 
  at a point 
 
 
 
  is the linear subspace of 
 
 
 
  spanned by the vectors 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  denotes the pushforward of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  belongs to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  is a diffeomorphism of 
 
 
 
  of the form 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If all the vector fields of the family 
 
 
 
 
  are analytic, then 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the evaluation at 
 
 
 
  of the Lie algebra generated by 
 
 
 
  with respect to the Lie bracket of vector fields. Otherwise, the inclusion 
 
 
 
 
  holds true.
Corollary (Rashevsky-Chow theorem)
If 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
  and if 
 
 
 
  is connected, then each orbit is equal to the whole manifold 
 
 
 
 .
