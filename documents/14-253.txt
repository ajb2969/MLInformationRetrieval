Photon surface

Photon sphere (definition1):
 A photon sphere of a static spherically symmetric metric is a timelike hypersurface 
 
 
 
  if the deflection angle of a light ray with the closest distance of approach 
 
 
 
  diverges as 
 
 

For a general static spherically symmetric metric



the photon sphere equation is:



The concept of a photon sphere in a static spherically metric was generalized to a photon surface of any metric.
Photon surface (definition2) :
 A photon surface of (M,g) is an immersed, nowhere spacelike hypersurface S of (M,' g') such that, for every point p∈S and every null vector k∈TpS, there exists a null geodesic

 
 :(-ε,ε)→M of (M,g) such that 
 
 
 
 (0)=k, |γ|⊂S.
Both definitions give the same result for a general static spherically symmetric metric.3
Theorem:4
 Subject to an energy condition, a black hole in any spherically symmetric spacetime must be surrounded by a photon sphere. Conversely, subject to an energy condition, any photon sphere must cover more than a certain amount of matter, a black hole, or a naked singularity.
