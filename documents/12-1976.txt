   Post-wall waveguide      Post-wall waveguide   A post-wall waveguide (also known as substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) or a laminated waveguide) is a synthetic rectangular electromagnetic waveguide formed in a dielectric substrate by densely arraying metallized posts or via-holes which connect the upper and lower metal plates of the substrate. The waveguide can be easily fabricated with low-cost and mass-production using through-hole techniques where the post walls consists of via fences . The post-wall waveguide is known to have similar guided wave and mode characteristics to the conventional rectangular waveguide with equivalent guided wavelength.  For instance, the equivalent width of a rectangular waveguide compared to a SIW is described in the approximation:       a   R  W  G    =     a   S  I  W    -    1.08    (   2  r   )   2    /  p    +    0.1    (   2  r   )   2    /   a   S  I  W           subscript  a    R  W  G         subscript  a    S  I  W        1.08   superscript    2  r   2    p        0.1   superscript    2  r   2     subscript  a    S  I  W        a_{RWG}=a_{SIW}-1.08(2r)^{2}/p+0.1(2r)^{2}/a_{SIW}     where   p   p   p   is the distance between the posts in the post wall,   r   r   r   describes the radius, and    a   R  W  G      subscript  a    R  W  G     a_{RWG}   as well as    a   S  I  W      subscript  a    S  I  W     a_{SIW}   are the widths of the rectangular waveguide, resp. SIW.  External links   siwspace.com â€“ A web on Substrate integrated waveguide   "  Category:Electronic design  Category:Microwave technology
