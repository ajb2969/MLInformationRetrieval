Orientation character

In algebraic topology, a branch of mathematics, an orientation character on a group

 
  is a group homomorphism


 
 . This notion is of particular significance in surgery theory.
Motivation
Given a manifold M, one takes 
 
 
 
  (the fundamental group), and then 
 
 
 
  sends an element of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  if and only if the class it represents is orientation-reversing.
This map 
 
 
 
  is trivial if and only if M is orientable.
The orientation character is an algebraic structure on the fundamental group of a manifold, which captures which loops are orientation reversing and which are orientation preserving.
Twisted group algebra
The orientation character defines a twisted involution (*-ring structure) on the group ring

 
 , by 
 
 
 
  (i.e., 
 
 
 
 , accordingly as 
 
 
 
  is orientation preserving or reversing). This is denoted 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

In real projective spaces, the orientation character evaluates trivially on loops if the dimension is odd, and assigns -1 to noncontractible loops in even dimension.

Properties
The orientation character is either trivial or has kernel an index 2 subgroup, which determines the map completely.
