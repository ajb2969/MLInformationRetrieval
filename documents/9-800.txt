   Orientation character      Orientation character   In algebraic topology , a branch of mathematics , an orientation character on a group    π   π   \pi   is a group homomorphism      ω  :   π  →   {   ±  1   }       normal-:  ω   normal-→  π    plus-or-minus  1       \omega\colon\pi\to\left\{\pm 1\right\}   . This notion is of particular significance in surgery theory .  Motivation  Given a manifold  M , one takes    π  =    π  1   M       π     subscript  π  1   M     \pi=\pi_{1}M   (the fundamental group ), and then   ω   ω   \omega   sends an element of   π   π   \pi   to    -  1      1    -1   if and only if the class it represents is orientation-reversing.  This map   ω   ω   \omega   is trivial if and only if M is orientable .  The orientation character is an algebraic structure on the fundamental group of a manifold, which captures which loops are orientation reversing and which are orientation preserving.  Twisted group algebra  The orientation character defines a twisted involution ( *-ring structure) on the group ring     𝐙   [  π  ]       𝐙   delimited-[]  π     \mathbf{Z}[\pi]   , by    g  ↦   ω   (  g  )    g   -  1        maps-to  g    ω  g   superscript  g    1       g\mapsto\omega(g)g^{-1}   (i.e.,    ±   g   -  1       plus-or-minus   superscript  g    1      \pm g^{-1}   , accordingly as   g   g   g   is orientation preserving or reversing). This is denoted    𝐙    [  π  ]   ω       𝐙   superscript   delimited-[]  π   ω     \mathbf{Z}[\pi]^{\omega}   .  Examples   In real projective spaces , the orientation character evaluates trivially on loops if the dimension is odd, and assigns -1 to noncontractible loops in even dimension.   Properties  The orientation character is either trivial or has kernel an index 2 subgroup, which determines the map completely.
