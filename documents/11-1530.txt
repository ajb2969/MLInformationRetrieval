   Kanamycin kinase      Kanamycin kinase   In enzymology , a kanamycin kinase also known as aminoglycoside-3'-phosphotransferase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + kanamycin    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + kanamycin 3'-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and kanamycin , whereas its two products are ADP and kanamycin 3'-phosphate . 1  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:kanamycin 3'-O-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called neomycin-kanamycin phosphotransferase .
