16S rRNA (cytidine1402-2'-O)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (cytidine1402-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, RsmI, YraL) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytidine1402-2'-O)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine1402 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine1402 in 16S rRNA
 

RsmI catalyses the 2'-O-methylation of cytidine1402.
