   16S rRNA (cytidine1402-2'-O)-methyltransferase      16S rRNA (cytidine1402-2'-O)-methyltransferase   16S rRNA (cytidine 1402 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, RsmI , YraL ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytidine 1402 -2'-O)-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine 1402 in 16S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine 1402 in 16S rRNA   RsmI catalyses the 2'-O-methylation of cytidine 1402 .
