   Steryl-beta-glucosidase      Steryl-beta-glucosidase   In enzymology , a steryl-beta-glucosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cholesteryl-beta-D-glucoside + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + cholesterol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cholesteryl-beta-D-glucoside and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-glucose and cholesterol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cholesteryl-beta-D-glucoside glucohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
