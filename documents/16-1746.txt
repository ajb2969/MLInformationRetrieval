   Supertransitive class      Supertransitive class   In set theory , a supertransitive class is a transitive class  1 which includes as a subset the power set of each of its elements .  Formally, let A be a transitive class. Then A is supertransitive if and only if       (  ∀  x  )    (  x  ∈  A  →  𝒫   (  x  )   ⊆  A  )   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  for-all  x  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  x   A  normal-→  P   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    A  normal-)   normal-.    (\forall x)(x\in A\to\mathcal{P}(x)\subseteq A).    2 Here P ( x ) denotes the power set of x . 3  See also   Transitive set  Rank (set theory)   References  "  Category:Set theory     Any element of a transitive set must also be its subset.
