Biorthogonal system

In mathematics, a biorthogonal system is a pair of indexed families of vectors


 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that


 
  where E and F form a pair of topological vector spaces that are in duality, 
 
 
 
  is a bilinear mapping and 
 
 
 
  is the Kronecker delta.
A biorthogonal system in which 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is an orthonormal system.
An example is the pair of sets of respectively left and right eigenvectors of a matrix, indexed by eigenvalue.
Projection
Related to a biorthogonal system is the projection


 
 , where 
 
 
 
 ; its image is the linear span of 
 
 
 
 , and the kernel is 
 
 
 
 .
Construction
Given a possibly non-orthogonal set of vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the projection related is


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the matrix with entries 
 
 
 
 .



 
 , and 
 
 
 
  then is an orthogonal system.
