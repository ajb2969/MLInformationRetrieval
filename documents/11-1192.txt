3-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 4-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a 3-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide 4-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

GDP-beta-L-fucose + beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R 
 
 
 
  GDP + beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-[alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->4)]-N-acetyl-beta-D- glucosaminyl-R
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP-beta-L-fucose and beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R, whereas its 3 products are GDP, [[beta-D-galactosyl-(1->3)-[alpha-L-fucosyl-(1->4)]-N-acetyl-beta-D-]], and glucosaminyl-R.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP-L-fucose:3-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R 4I-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include (Lea)-dependent (alpha-3/4)-fucosyltransferase, alpha(1,3/1,4) fucosyltransferase III, alpha-(1->4)-L-fucosyltransferase, alpha-4-L-fucosyltransferase, beta-acetylglucosaminylsaccharide fucosyltransferase, FucT-II, Lewis alpha-(1->3/4)-fucosyltransferase, Lewis blood group alpha-(1->3/4)-fucosyltransferase, Lewis(Le) blood group gene-dependent, alpha-(1->3/4)-L-fucosyltransferase, blood group Lewis alpha-4-fucosyltransferase, blood-group substance Lea-dependent fucosyltransferase, guanosine diphosphofucose-beta-acetylglucosaminylsaccharide, 4-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase, guanosine diphosphofucose-glycoprotein 4-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase, guanosine diphosphofucose-glycoprotein 4-alpha-fucosyltransferase, 3-alpha-galactosyl-N-acetylglucosaminide, 4-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase, GDP-beta-L-fucose:3-beta-D-galactosyl-N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl-R, and 4I-alpha-L-fucosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - lactoseries, glycosphingolipid biosynthesis - neo-lactoseries, and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2.
