Next-generation matrix

In epidemiology, the next-generation matrix is a method used to derive the basic reproduction number, for a compartmental model of the spread of infectious diseases. This method is given by Diekmann et al. (1990)1 and Driessche and Watmough (2002).2 To calculate the basic reproduction number by using a next-generation matrix, the whole population is divided into 
 
 
 
  compartments in which there are 
 
 
 
  be the numbers of infected individuals in the 
 
 
 
  infected compartment at time t. Now, the epidemic model is


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  In the above equations, 
 
 
 
  represents the rate of appearance of new infections in compartment 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  represents the rate of transfer of individuals into compartment 
 
 
 
  by all other means, and 
 
 
 
  represents the rate of transfer of individuals out of compartment 
 
 
 
 . The above model can also be written as



where



and



Let 
 
 
 
  be the disease-free equilibrium. The values of the Jacobian matrices

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are:



and


 
  respectively.
Here, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are m × m matrices, defined as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Now, the matrix 
 
 
 
  is known as the next-generation matrix. The largest eigenvalue or spectral radius of $FV^{-1}$ is the basic reproduction number of the model.
