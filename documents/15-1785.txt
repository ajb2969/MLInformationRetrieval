   Dirac equation in curved spacetime      Dirac equation in curved spacetime   In mathematical physics , the Dirac equation in curved spacetime generalizes the original Dirac equation to curved space .  It can be written by using vierbein fields and the gravitational spin connection . The vierbein defines a local rest frame , allowing the constant Dirac matrices to act at each spacetime point. In this way, Dirac's equation takes the following form in curved spacetime: 1        i   γ  a    e  a  μ    D  μ   Ψ   -   m  Ψ    =  0.          i   superscript  γ  a    superscript   subscript  e  a   μ    subscript  D  μ   normal-Ψ     m  normal-Ψ    0.    i\gamma^{a}e_{a}^{\mu}D_{\mu}\Psi-m\Psi=0.     Here is the vierbein and is the covariant derivative for fermionic fields , defined as follows        D  μ   =    ∂  μ   -    i  4    ω  μ   a  b     σ   a  b       ,       subscript  D  μ      subscript   μ       i  4    superscript   subscript  ω  μ     a  b     subscript  σ    a  b        D_{\mu}=\partial_{\mu}-\frac{i}{4}\omega_{\mu}^{ab}\sigma_{ab},     where is the commutator of Dirac matrices:        σ   a  b    =    i  2    [   γ  a   ,   γ  b   ]     ,       subscript  σ    a  b        i  2     subscript  γ  a    subscript  γ  b       \sigma_{ab}=\frac{i}{2}\left[\gamma_{a},\gamma_{b}\right],     and are the spin connection components.  Note that here Latin indices denote the "Lorentzian" vierbein labels while Greek indices denote manifold coordinate indices.
