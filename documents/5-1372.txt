Sublinear function

A sublinear function (or functional, as is more often used in functional analysis), in linear algebra and related areas of mathematics, is a function 
 
 
 
  on a vector space V over F, an ordered field (e.g. the real numbers

 
 ), which satisfies


 
   for any positive 
 
 
 
  and any x ∈ V (positive homogeneity),


 
   for any x, y ∈ V (subadditivity).
In functional analysis the name Banach functional is used for sublinear function, especially when formulating Hahn–Banach theorem.
In computer science, a function 
 
 
 
  is called sublinear if 
 
 
 
  in asymptotic notation (Notice the small 
 
 
 
 ). Formally, 
 
 
 
  if and only if, for any given 
 
 
 
 , there exists an 
 
 
 
  such that1



This means that for any linear function 
 
 
 
 , for sufficiently large input 
 
 
 
  grows slower than 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

Every (semi-)norm is a sublinear function. The opposite is not true, because (semi-)norms can have their domain vector space over any field (not necessarily ordered) and must have 
 
 
 
  as their codomain.

Properties

Every sublinear function is a convex functional.

Operators
The concept can be extended to operators that are homogeneous and subadditive. This requires only that the codomain be, say, an ordered vector space to make sense of the conditions.
