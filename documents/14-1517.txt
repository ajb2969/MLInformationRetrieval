Predictable process

In stochastic analysis, a part of the mathematical theory of probability, a predictable process is a stochastic process whose value is knowable at a prior time. The predictable processes form the smallest class that is closed under taking limits of sequences and contains all adapted left-continuous processes.
Mathematical definition
Discrete-time process
Given a filtered probability space

 
 , then a stochastic process 
 
 
 
  is predictable if 
 
 
 
  is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra

 
  for each n.1
Continuous-time process
Given a filtered probability space 
 
 
 
 , then a continuous-time stochastic process

 
  is predictable if 
 
 
 
 , considered as a mapping from 
 
 
 
 , is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by all left-continuous adapted processes.2
Examples

Every deterministic process is a predictable process.
Every continuous-time adapted process that is left continuous is a predictable process.
