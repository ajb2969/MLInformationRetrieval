   Predictable process      Predictable process   In stochastic analysis , a part of the mathematical theory of probability , a predictable process is a stochastic process whose value is knowable at a prior time. The predictable processes form the smallest class that is closed under taking limits of sequences and contains all adapted left-continuous processes.  Mathematical definition  Discrete-time process  Given a filtered probability space     (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,    (   ℱ  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ    ,  ℙ  )     normal-Ω  ℱ   subscript   subscript  ℱ  n     n  ℕ    ℙ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}},\mathbb{P})   , then a stochastic process     (   X  n   )    n  ∈  ℕ      subscript   subscript  X  n     n  ℕ     (X_{n})_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   is predictable if    X   n  +  1      subscript  X    n  1     X_{n+1}   is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra     ℱ  n     subscript  ℱ  n    \mathcal{F}_{n}   for each n . 1  Continuous-time process  Given a filtered probability space    (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,    (   ℱ  t   )    t  ≥  0    ,  ℙ  )     normal-Ω  ℱ   subscript   subscript  ℱ  t     t  0    ℙ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},(\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t\geq 0},\mathbb{P})   , then a continuous-time stochastic process      (   X  t   )    t  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  X  t     t  0     (X_{t})_{t\geq 0}   is predictable if   X   X   X   , considered as a mapping from    Ω  ×   ℝ  +       normal-Ω   subscript  ℝ      \Omega\times\mathbb{R}_{+}   , is measurable with respect to the σ-algebra generated by all left-continuous adapted processes. 2  Examples   Every deterministic process is a predictable process.  Every continuous-time adapted process that is left continuous is a predictable process.   See also   Adapted process  Martingale   References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩  ↩
