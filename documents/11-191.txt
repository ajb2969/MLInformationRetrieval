   Cyclohexyl-isocyanide hydratase      Cyclohexyl-isocyanide hydratase   In enzymology , a cyclohexyl-isocyanide hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-cyclohexylformamide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cyclohexyl isocyanide + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , N-cyclohexylformamide , and two products , cyclohexyl isocyanide and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-cyclohexylformamide hydro-lyase (cyclohexyl-isocyanide-forming) . Other names in common use include isonitrile hydratase , and N-cyclohexylformamide hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in caprolactam degradation .
