   Inhabited set      Inhabited set   In constructive mathematics , a set  A is inhabited if there exists an element    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   . In classical mathematics, this is the same as the set being nonempty; however, this equivalence is not valid in intuitionistic logic .  Comparison with nonempty sets  In classical mathematics , a set is inhabited if and only if it is not the empty set . These definitions diverge in constructive mathematics , however. A set A is nonempty if it is not empty, that is, if      ¬   [  ∀  z   (  z  ∉  A  )   ]   .     fragments    fragments  normal-[  for-all  z   fragments  normal-(  z   A  normal-)   normal-]   normal-.    \lnot[\forall z(z\not\in A)].   It is inhabited if      ∃  z   (  z  ∈  A  )   .     fragments   z   fragments  normal-(  z   A  normal-)   normal-.    \exists z(z\in A).   In intuitionistic logic, the negation of a universal quantifier is weaker than an existential quantifier, not equivalent to it as in classical logic .  Example  Because inhabited sets are the same as nonempty sets in classical logic, it is not possible to produce a model in the classical sense that contains a nonempty set X but does not satisfy " X is inhabited". But it is possible to construct a Kripke model  M that satisfies " X is nonempty" without satisfying " X is inhabited". Because an implication is provable in intuitionistic logic if and only if it is true in every Kripke model, this means that one cannot prove in this logic that " X is nonempty" implies " X is inhabited".  The possibility of this construction relies on the intuitionistic interpretation of the existential quantifier. In an intuitionistic setting, in order for    ∃   z  ϕ   (  z  )          z  ϕ  z     \exists z\phi(z)   to hold, for some formula   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   , it is necessary for a specific value of z satisfying   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   to be known.  For example, consider a subset X of {0,1} specified by the following rule: 0 belongs to X if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is true, and 1 belongs to X if and only if the Riemann hypothesis is false. If we assume that Riemann hypothesis is either true or false, then X is not empty, but any constructive proof that X is inhabited would either prove that 0 is in X or that 1 is in X . Thus a constructive proof that X is inhabited would determine the truth value of the Riemann hypothesis, which is not known, By replacing the Riemann hypothesis in this example by a generic proposition, one can construct a Kripke model with a set that is neither empty nor inhabited (even if the Riemann hypothesis itself is ever proved or refuted).
