Secologanin synthase




Secologanin synthase

In enzymology, a secologanin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

loganin + NADPH + H+ + O2

 
  secologanin + NADP+ + 2 H2O
 

The 4 substrates of this enzyme are loganin, NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas its 3 products are secologanin, NADP+, and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is loganin:oxygen oxidoreductase (ring-cleaving). This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac alkaloid biosynthesis.
