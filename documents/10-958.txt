   Secologanin synthase      Secologanin synthase   In enzymology , a secologanin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   loganin + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   secologanin + NADP + + 2 H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are loganin , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are secologanin , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is loganin:oxygen oxidoreductase (ring-cleaving) . This enzyme participates in indole and ipecac  alkaloid biosynthesis.
