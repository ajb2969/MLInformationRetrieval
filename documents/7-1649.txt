   Iterated monodromy group      Iterated monodromy group   In geometric group theory and dynamical systems the iterated monodromy group of a covering map is a group describing the monodromy action of the fundamental group on all iterations of the covering. A single covering map between spaces is therefore used to create a tower of coverings, by placing the covering over itself repeatedly. In terms of the Galois theory of covering spaces , this construction on spaces is expected to correspond to a construction on groups. The iterated monodromy group provides this construction, and it is applied to encode the combinatorics and symbolic dynamics of the covering, and provide examples of self-similar groups .  Definition  The iterated monodromy group of f is the following quotient group :       IMG  f   :=     π  1    (  X  ,  t  )      ⋂   n  ∈  ℕ      Ker    ϝ  n         assign    IMG  f        subscript  π  1    X  t      subscript     n  ℕ      Ker   superscript  ϝ  n        \mathrm{IMG}f:=\frac{\pi_{1}(X,t)}{\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}\mathrm{Ker}\,%

Action  The iterated monodromy group acts by automorphism on the rooted tree of preimages        T  f   :=    ⊔   n  ≥  0      f   -  n     (  t  )      ,     assign   subscript  T  f     subscript  square-union    n  0       superscript  f    n    t      T_{f}:=\bigsqcup_{n\geq 0}f^{-n}(t),   where a vertex    z  ∈    f   -  n     (  t  )        z     superscript  f    n    t     z\in f^{-n}(t)   is connected by an edge with     f   (  z  )    ∈    f   -   (   n  -  1   )      (  t  )          f  z      superscript  f      n  1     t     f(z)\in f^{-(n-1)}(t)   .  Examples  Iterated monodromy groups of rational functions  Let :   f be a complex rational function      P  f     subscript  P  f    P_{f}   be the union of forward orbits of its critical points (the post-critical set ).   If    P  f     subscript  P  f    P_{f}   is finite (or has a finite set of accumulation points ), then the iterated monodromy group of f is the iterated monodromy group of the covering    f  :     C  ^   ∖    f   -  1     (   P  f   )     →    C  ^   ∖   P  f        normal-:  f   normal-→     normal-^  C      superscript  f    1     subscript  P  f        normal-^  C    subscript  P  f       f:\hat{C}\setminus f^{-1}(P_{f})\rightarrow\hat{C}\setminus P_{f}   , where    C  ^     normal-^  C    \hat{C}   is the Riemann sphere .  Iterated monodromy groups of rational functions usually have exotic properties from the point of view of classical group theory. Most of them are infinitely presented, many have intermediate growth .
