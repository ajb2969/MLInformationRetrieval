   Mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (GDP)      Mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (GDP)   In enzymology , a mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase (GDP) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP + alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphate + GDP-mannose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP and alpha-D-mannose 1-phosphate , whereas its two products are phosphate and GDP-mannose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP:alpha-D-mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism .  Other common names   GDP mannose phosphorylase  Mannose 1-phosphate (guanosine diphosphate) guanylyltransferase  GDP mannose phosphorylase  GDP-mannose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase  Guanosine diphosphate-mannose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase  Guanosine diphosphomannose phosphorylase  Mannose 1-phosphate guanylyltransferase  GDP:D-mannose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase   References     "  Category:EC 2.7.7  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
