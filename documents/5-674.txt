   Kuder–Richardson Formula 20      Kuder–Richardson Formula 20   In statistics , the Kuder–Richardson Formula 20 (KR-20) first published in 1937 1 is a measure of internal consistency reliability for measures with dichotomous choices. It is analogous to Cronbach's α , except Cronbach's α is also used for non-dichotomous (continuous) measures. 2 It is often claimed that a high KR-20 coefficient (e.g., > 0.90) indicates a homogeneous test . However, like Cronbach's α, homogeneity (that is, unidimensionality) is actually an assumption, not a conclusion, of reliability coefficients. It is possible, for example, to have a high KR-20 with a multidimensional scale, especially with a large number of items.  Values can range from 0.00 to 1.00 (sometimes expressed as 0 to 100), with high values indicating that the examination is likely to correlate with alternate forms (a desirable characteristic). The KR-20 may be affected by difficulty of the test, the spread in scores and the length of the examination.  In the case when scores are not tau-equivalent (for example when there is not homogeneous but rather examination items of increasing difficulty) then the KR-20 is an indication of the lower bound of internal consistency (reliability).  The formula for KR-20 for a test with K test items numbered i =1 to K is      r  =    K   K  -  1     [   1  -     ∑   i  =  1   K     p  i    q  i      σ  X  2     ]        r      K    K  1     delimited-[]    1      superscript   subscript     i  1    K      subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i      subscript   superscript  σ  2   X         r=\frac{K}{K-1}\left[1-\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{K}p_{i}q_{i}}{\sigma^{2}_{X}}\right]     where p i is the proportion of correct responses to test item i , q i is the proportion of incorrect responses to test item i (so that p i + q i = 1), and the variance for the denominator is        σ  X  2   =     ∑   i  =  1   n      (    X  i   -   X  ¯    )   2     n    .       subscript   superscript  σ  2   X       superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript     subscript  X  i    normal-¯  X    2    n     \sigma^{2}_{X}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}(X_{i}-\bar{X})^{2}\,{}}{n}.     where n is the total sample size.  If it is important to use unbiased operators then the sum of squares should be divided by degrees of freedom ( n − 1) and the probabilities are multiplied by      n   n  -  1       n    n  1     \frac{n}{n-1}     Since Cronbach's α was published in 1951, there has been no known advantage to KR-20 over Cronbach. KR-20 is seen as a derivative of the Cronbach formula, with the advantage to Cronbach that it can handle both dichotomous and continuous variables. The KR-20 formula can't be used when multiple-choice questions involve partial credit, and it requires detailed item analysis. 3  References  External links   Statistical analysis of multiple choice exams  Quality of assessment chapter in Illinois State Assessment handbook (1995)   "  Category:Comparison of assessments  Category:Psychometrics  Category:Educational psychology research methods     Kuder, G.
