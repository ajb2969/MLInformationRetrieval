   Fixed-point index      Fixed-point index   In mathematics , the fixed-point index is a concept in topological  fixed-point theory, and in particular Nielsen theory . The fixed-point index can be thought of as a multiplicity measurement for fixed points.  The index can be easily defined in the setting of complex analysis : Let f ( z ) be a holomorphic mapping on the complex plane, and let z 0 be a fixed point of f . Then the function f ( z ) − z is holomorphic, and has an isolated zero at z 0 . We define the fixed point index of f at z 0 , denoted i ( f , z 0 ), to be the multiplicity of the zero of the function f ( z ) − z at the point z 0 .  In real Euclidean space, the fixed-point index is defined as follows: If x 0 is an isolated fixed point of f , then let g be the function defined by        g   (  x  )    =    x  -   f   (  x  )      ||   x  -   f   (  x  )     ||     .        g  x       x    f  x     norm    x    f  x        g(x)=\frac{x-f(x)}{||x-f(x)||}.\,     Then g has an isolated singularity at x 0 , and maps the boundary of some deleted neighborhood of x 0 to the unit sphere. We define i ( f , x 0 ) to be the Brouwer  degree of the mapping induced by g on some suitably chosen small sphere around x 0 . 1  The Lefschetz–Hopf theorem  The importance of the fixed-point index is largely due to its role in the Lefschetz – Hopf theorem, which states:         ∑   x  ∈   Fix   (  f  )       i   (  f  ,  x  )     =   Λ  f    ,        subscript     x    Fix  f       i   f  x      subscript  normal-Λ  f     \sum_{x\in\mathrm{Fix}(f)}i(f,x)=\Lambda_{f},     where Fix( f ) is the set of fixed points of f , and Λ f is the Lefschetz number of f .  Since the quantity on the left-hand side of the above is clearly zero when f has no fixed points, the Lefschetz–Hopf theorem trivially implies the Lefschetz fixed point theorem .
