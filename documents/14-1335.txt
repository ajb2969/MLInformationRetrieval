   Tricomi–Carlitz polynomials      Tricomi–Carlitz polynomials   In mathematics, the Tricomi–Carlitz polynomials or (Carlitz–)Karlin–McGregor polynomials are polynomials studied by  and  and , related to random walks on the positive integers .  They are given in terms of Laguerre polynomials by         l  n    (  x  )    =     (   -  1   )   n    L  n   (   x  -  n   )     (  x  )     .         subscript  l  n   x      superscript    1   n    superscript   subscript  L  n     x  n    x     \displaystyle l_{n}(x)=(-1)^{n}L_{n}^{(x-n)}(x).     They are special cases of the Chihara–Ismail polynomials .  References       "  Category:Orthogonal polynomials
