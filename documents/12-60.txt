The    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   and s chart plots the mean value for the quality characteristic across all units in the sample,     x  ¯   i     subscript   normal-¯  x   i    \bar{x}_{i}   , plus the standard deviation of the quality characteristic across all units in the sample as follows:      s  =      ∑   i  =  1   n     (    x  i   -   x  ¯    )   2     n  -  1         s        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript     subscript  x  i    normal-¯  x    2      n  1       s=\sqrt{\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}{\left(x_{i}-\bar{x}\right)}^{2}}{n-1}}   .  The normal distribution is the basis for the charts and requires the following assumptions:   The quality characteristic to be monitored is adequately modeled by a normally-distributed  random variable  The parameters μ and σ for the random variable are the same for each unit and each unit is independent of its predecessors or successors  The inspection procedure is same for each sample and is carried out consistently from sample to sample   The control limits for this chart type are: 3        B  3    s  ¯        subscript  B  3    normal-¯  s     B_{3}\bar{s}   (lower) and     B  4    s  ¯        subscript  B  4    normal-¯  s     B_{4}\bar{s}   (upper) for monitoring the process variability       x  ¯   ±    A  3    s  ¯       plus-or-minus   normal-¯  x      subscript  A  3    normal-¯  s      \bar{x}\pm A_{3}\bar{s}   for monitoring the process mean    where    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   and     s  ¯   =      ∑   i  =  1   m     s  i    m        normal-¯  s       superscript   subscript     i  1    m    subscript  s  i    m     \bar{s}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{m}s_{i}}{m}   are the estimates of the long-term process mean and range established during control-chart setup and A 3 , B 3 , and B 4 are sample size-specific anti-biasing constants. The anti-biasing constants are typically found in the appendices of textbooks on statistical process control .   As with the     x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   and R and individuals control charts , the    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   chart is only valid if the within-sample variability is constant. 4 Thus, the s chart is examined before the    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   chart; if the s chart indicates the sample variability is in statistical control, then the    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   chart is examined to determine if the sample mean is also in statistical control. If on the other hand, the sample variability is not in statistical control, then the entire process is judged to be not in statistical control regardless of what the    x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   chart indicates.  When samples collected from the process are of unequal sizes (arising from a mistake in collecting them, for example), there are two approaches:      Technique   Description       Use variable-width control limits 5   Each observation plots against its own control limits as determined by the sample size-specific values, n i , of A 3 , B 3 , and B 4     Use control limits based on an average sample size 6   Control limits are fixed at the modal (or most common) sample size-specific value of A 3 , B 3 , and B 4     See also       x  ¯     normal-¯  x    \bar{x}   and R chart  Shewhart individuals control chart   References  "  Category:Quality control tools  Category:Statistical charts and diagrams     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
