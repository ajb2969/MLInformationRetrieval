   Regular conditional probability      Regular conditional probability   Regular conditional probability is a concept that has developed to overcome certain difficulties in formally defining conditional probabilities for continuous probability distributions . It is defined as an alternative probability measure conditioned on a particular value of a random variable .  Motivation  Normally we define the conditional probability of an event A given an event B as:      P   (  A  |  B  )   =    P   (   A  ∩  B   )     P   (  B  )     .     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-|  B  normal-)        P    A  B      P  B    normal-.    P(A|B)=\frac{P(A\cap B)}{P(B)}.   The difficulty with this arises when the event B is too small to have a non-zero probability. For example, suppose we have a random variable  X with a uniform distribution on     [  0  ,  1  ]   ,     0  1    [0,1],   and B is the event that    X  =   2  /  3.       X    2  3.     X=2/3.   Clearly the probability of B in this case is      P   (  B  )    =  0   ,        P  B   0    P(B)=0,   but nonetheless we would still like to assign meaning to a conditional probability such as    P   (  A  |  X  =  2  /  3  )   .     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-|  X   2   3  normal-)   normal-.    P(A|X=2/3).   To do so rigorously requires the definition of a regular conditional probability.  Definition  Let    (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  P  )     normal-Ω  ℱ  P    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)   be a probability space , and let    T  :   Ω  →  E      normal-:  T   normal-→  normal-Ω  E     T:\Omega\rightarrow E   be a random variable , defined as a Borel- measurable function from   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   to its state space      (  E  ,  ℰ  )   .     E  ℰ    (E,\mathcal{E}).   Then a regular conditional probability is defined as a function     ν  :    E  ×  ℱ   →   [  0  ,  1  ]     ,     normal-:  ν   normal-→    E  ℱ    0  1      \nu:E\times\mathcal{F}\rightarrow[0,1],   called a "transition probability", where    ν   (  x  ,  A  )       ν   x  A     \nu(x,A)   is a valid probability measure (in its second argument) on   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   for all    x  ∈  E      x  E    x\in E   and a measurable function in E (in its first argument) for all     A  ∈  ℱ   ,      A  ℱ    A\in\mathcal{F},   such that for all    A  ∈  ℱ      A  ℱ    A\in\mathcal{F}   and all    B  ∈  ℰ      B  ℰ    B\in\mathcal{E}    1        P   (   A  ∩    T   -  1     (  B  )     )    =    ∫  B    ν   (  x  ,  A  )   P   (    T   -  1     (   d  x   )    )      .        P    A     superscript  T    1    B       subscript   B     ν   x  A   P     superscript  T    1      d  x        P\big(A\cap T^{-1}(B)\big)=\int_{B}\nu(x,A)\,P\big(T^{-1}(dx)\big).     To express this in our more familiar notation:      P   (  A  |  T  =  x  )   =  ν   (  x  ,  A  )   ,     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-|  T   x  normal-)    ν   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-,  A  normal-)   normal-,    P(A|T=x)=\nu(x,A),   where     x  ∈    supp   T    ,      x    supp  T     x\in\mathrm{supp}\,T,   i.e. the topological support of the pushforward measure        T  *   P   =   P   (    T   -  1     (  ⋅  )    )     .         subscript  T    P     P     superscript  T    1    normal-⋅      T_{*}P=P\big(T^{-1}(\cdot)\big).   As can be seen from the integral above, the value of   ν   ν   \nu   for points x outside the support of the random variable is meaningless; its significance as a conditional probability is strictly limited to the support of T .  The measurable space     (  Ω  ,  ℱ  )     normal-Ω  ℱ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F})   is said to have the regular conditional probability property if for all probability measures    P   P   P   on     (  Ω  ,  ℱ  )   ,     normal-Ω  ℱ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F}),   all random variables on    (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  P  )     normal-Ω  ℱ  P    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},P)   admit a regular conditional probability. A Radon space , in particular, has this property.  See also conditional probability and conditional probability distribution .  Alternate definition  Consider a Radon space   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   (that is a probability measure defined on a Radon space endowed with the Borel sigma-algebra) and a real-valued random variable T . As discussed above, in this case there exists a regular conditional probability with respect to T . Moreover we can alternatively define the regular conditional probability for an event A given a particular value t of the random variable T in the following manner:      P   (  A  |  T  =  t  )   =   lim   U  ⊃   {  T  =  t  }       P   (   A  ∩  U   )     P   (  U  )     ,     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-|  T   t  normal-)     subscript    fragments  U  superset-of   fragments  normal-{  T   t  normal-}         P    A  U      P  U    normal-,    P(A|T=t)=\lim_{U\supset\{T=t\}}\frac{P(A\cap U)}{P(U)},     where the limit is taken over the net of open  neighborhoods  U of t as they become smaller with respect to set inclusion . This limit is defined if and only if the probability space is Radon , and only in the support of T , as described in the article. This is the restriction of the transition probability to the support of T . To describe this limiting process rigorously:  For every     ϵ  >  0   ,      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0,   there exists an open neighborhood U of t , such that for every open V with     t  ∈  V  ⊂  U   ,        t  V       U     t\in V\subset U,           |     P   (   A  ∩  V   )     P   (  V  )     -  L   |   <  ϵ   ,              P    A  V      P  V    L    ϵ    \left|\frac{P(A\cap V)}{P(V)}-L\right|<\epsilon,   where    L  =  P   (  A  |  T  =  t  )      fragments  L   P   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-|  T   t  normal-)     L=P(A|T=t)   is the limit.  Example  To continue with our motivating example above, we consider a real-valued random variable X and write      P   (  A  |  X  =   x  0   )   =  ν   (   x  0   ,  A  )   =   lim   ϵ  →   0  +       P   (  A  ∩   {   x  0   -  ϵ  <  X  <   x  0   +  ϵ  }   )     P   (   {   x  0   -  ϵ  <  X  <   x  0   +  ϵ  }   )     ,     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-|  X    subscript  x  0   normal-)    ν   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  0   normal-,  A  normal-)     subscript    normal-→  ϵ   limit-from  0         fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  A    fragments  normal-{   subscript  x  0    ϵ   X    subscript  x  0    ϵ  normal-}   normal-)     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{   subscript  x  0    ϵ   X    subscript  x  0    ϵ  normal-}   normal-)     normal-,    P(A|X=x_{0})=\nu(x_{0},A)=\lim_{\epsilon\rightarrow 0+}\frac{P(A\cap\{x_{0}-%
 \epsilon   (where     x  0   =   2  /  3        subscript  x  0     2  3     x_{0}=2/3   for the example given.) This limit, if it exists, is a regular conditional probability for X , restricted to      supp   X   .      supp  X    \mathrm{supp}\,X.     In any case, it is easy to see that this limit fails to exist for    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   outside the support of X : since the support of a random variable is defined as the set of all points in its state space whose every neighborhood has positive probability, for every point    x  0     subscript  x  0    x_{0}   outside the support of X (by definition) there will be an    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   such that    P   (   {   x  0   -  ϵ  <  X  <   x  0   +  ϵ  }   )   =  0.     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-{   subscript  x  0    ϵ   X    subscript  x  0    ϵ  normal-}   normal-)    0.    P(\{x_{0}-\epsilon     Thus if X is distributed uniformly on     [  0  ,  1  ]   ,     0  1    [0,1],   it is truly meaningless to condition a probability on "    X  =   3  /  2       X    3  2     X=3/2   ".
