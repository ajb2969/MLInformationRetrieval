Centered cube number

 A centered cube number is a centered figurate number that counts the number of points in a three-dimensional pattern formed by a point surrounded by concentric cubical layers of points, with i2 points on the square faces of the ith layer. Equivalently, it is the number of points in a body-centered cubic pattern within a cube that has n + 1 points along each of its edges.
The first few centered cube numbers are

1, 9, 35, 91, 189, 341, 559, 855, 1241, 1729, 2331, 3059, 3925, 4941, 6119, 7471, 9009, ... .
 

Formulas
The centered cube number for a pattern with n concentric layers around the central point is given by the formula1



The same number can also be expressed as a trapezoidal number (difference of two triangular numbers), or a sum of consecutive numbers, as2



Properties
Because of the factorization 
 
 
 
 , it is impossible for a centered cube number to be a prime number.3 The only centered cube number that is also a square number is 9.45
