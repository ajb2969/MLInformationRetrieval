   Centered cube number      Centered cube number   A centered cube number is a centered  figurate number that counts the number of points in a three-dimensional pattern formed by a point surrounded by concentric cubical layers of points, with i 2 points on the square faces of the i th layer. Equivalently, it is the number of points in a body-centered cubic pattern within a cube that has n + 1 points along each of its edges.  The first few centered cube numbers are   1 , 9 , 35 , 91 , 189 , 341, 559, 855, 1241, 1729 , 2331, 3059, 3925, 4941, 6119, 7471, 9009, ... .   Formulas  The centered cube number for a pattern with n concentric layers around the central point is given by the formula 1         n  3   +    (   n  +  1   )   3    =    (    2  n   +  1   )    (    n  2   +  n  +  1   )     .         superscript  n  3    superscript    n  1   3          2  n   1      superscript  n  2   n  1      n^{3}+(n+1)^{3}=(2n+1)(n^{2}+n+1).     The same number can also be expressed as a trapezoidal number (difference of two triangular numbers ), or a sum of consecutive numbers, as 2         (        (   n  +  1   )   2   +  1       2     )   -   (       n  2   +  1       2     )    =    (    n  2   +  1   )   +   (    n  2   +  2   )   +  ⋯  +    (   n  +  1   )   2     .         binomial     superscript    n  1   2   1   2    binomial     superscript  n  2   1   2         superscript  n  2   1      superscript  n  2   2   normal-⋯   superscript    n  1   2      {\left({{(n+1)^{2}+1}\atop{2}}\right)}-{\left({{n^{2}+1}\atop{2}}\right)}=(n^{%
 2}+1)+(n^{2}+2)+\cdots+(n+1)^{2}.     Properties  Because of the factorization     (    2  n   +  1   )    (    n  2   +  n  +  1   )           2  n   1      superscript  n  2   n  1     (2n+1)(n^{2}+n+1)   , it is impossible for a centered cube number to be a prime number . 3 The only centered cube number that is also a square number is 9. 4 5  See also   Cube number   References  External links     "  Category:Figurate numbers     . ↩  . ↩  ↩  . ↩  . ↩
