Fiber derivative

In the context of Lagrangian Mechanics the fiber derivative is used to convert between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian forms. In particular, if 
 
 
 
  is the configuration manifold then the Lagrangian 
 
 
 
  is defined on the tangent bundle

 
  and the Hamiltonian is defined on the cotangent bundle

 
 â€”the fiber derivative is a map 
 
 
 
  such that


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are vectors from the same tangent space. When restricted to a particular point, the fiber derivative is a Legendre transformation.
