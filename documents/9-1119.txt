   Fiber derivative      Fiber derivative   In the context of Lagrangian Mechanics the fiber derivative is used to convert between the Lagrangian and Hamiltonian forms. In particular, if   Q   Q   Q   is the configuration manifold then the Lagrangian   L   L   L   is defined on the tangent bundle     T  Q      T  Q    TQ   and the Hamiltonian is defined on the cotangent bundle      T  *   Q       superscript  T    Q    T^{*}Q   —the fiber derivative is a map     𝔽  L   :    T  Q   →    T  *   Q       normal-:    𝔽  L    normal-→    T  Q      superscript  T    Q      \mathbb{F}L:TQ\rightarrow T^{*}Q   such that        𝔽  L   (  v  )    ⋅  w   =      d   d  s    |    s  =  0    L   (   v  +   s  w    )         normal-⋅    𝔽  L  v   w      evaluated-at    d    d  s      s  0    L    v    s  w       \mathbb{F}L(v)\cdot w=\frac{d}{ds}|_{s=0}L(v+sw)   ,  where   v   v   v   and   w   w   w   are vectors from the same tangent space. When restricted to a particular point, the fiber derivative is a Legendre transformation .  "  Category:Lagrangian mechanics
