   Chebotaryov theorem on roots of unity      Chebotaryov theorem on roots of unity   The theorem state that all submatrices of a DFT matrix of prime length are invertible.  The Chebotaryov theorem on roots of unity was originally a conjecture made by Ostrowski in the context of lacunary series . Chebotaryov was the first to prove it, in the 1930s. This proof involves tools from Galois theory and did not please Ostrowski , who made comments arguing that it " does not meet the requirements of mathematical esthetics " . 1  Several proofs have been proposed since, 2 and it has even been discovered independently by Dieudonné . 3  Statement  Let   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   be a matrix with entries      a   i  j    =   ω   i  j     ,    1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  n       formulae-sequence     subscript  a    i  j     superscript  ω    i  j      formulae-sequence    1  i     j  n      a_{ij}=\omega^{ij},1\leq i,j\leq n   , where     ω  =   e    2  i  π   /  n     ,   n  ∈  ℕ      formulae-sequence    ω   superscript  e      2  i  π   n       n  ℕ     \omega=e^{2i\pi/n},n\in\mathbb{N}   . If   n   n   n   is prime then any minor of   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is non-zero.  Applications  For signal processing purposes, 4 as a consequence of the Chebotaryov theorem on roots of unity , T. Tao stated an extension of the uncertainty principle . 5  Notes    References             "  Category:Theorems in linear algebra  Category:Theorems in algebraic number theory     Stevenhagen et Al., 1996 ↩  P.E.
