Hahn–Banach theorem




Hahn–Banach theorem
In [[mathematics]], the '''Hahn–Banach Theorem''' is a central tool in [[functional analysis]]. It allows the extension of [[Bounded operator|bounded linear functionals]] defined on a subspace of some [[vector space]] to the whole space, and it also shows that there are "enough" [[continuous function (topology)|continuous]] linear functionals defined on every [[normed vec
 tor space]] to make the study of the dual space "interesting". Another version of Hahn–Banach theorem is known as Hahn–Banach separation theorem or the separating hyperplane theorem, and has numerous uses in convex geometry. It is named for Hans Hahn and Stefan Banach who proved this theorem independently in the late 1920s, although a special case1 was proved earlier (in 1912) by Eduard Helly,2 and a general extension theorem from which the Hahn–Banach theorem can be derived was proved in 1923 by Marcel Riesz.3
Formulation
The most general formulation of the theorem needs some preparation. Given a real vector space

 
 , a function

 
  is called sublinear if

Positive Homogeneity:

 
  for all ,
Subadditivity:

 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .

Every seminorm on 
 
 
 
  (in particular, every norm on 
 
 
 
 ) is sublinear. Other sublinear functions can be useful as well, especially Minkowski functionals of convex sets.
Hahn–Banach Theorem . If 
 
 
 
  is a sublinear function, and 
 
 
 
  is a linear functional on a linear subspace

 
  which is dominated by 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



then there exists a linear extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  to the whole space 
 
 
 
 , i.e., there exists a linear functional 
 
 
 
  such that






Hahn–Banach Theorem (Alternate Version). Set 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
 -vector space with a seminorm 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -linear functional on a 
 
 
 
 -linear subspace 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  which is dominated by 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  in absolute value,



then there exists a linear extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  to the whole space 
 
 
 
 , i.e., there exists a 
 
 
 
 -linear functional 
 
 
 
  such that






In the complex case of the alternate version, the 
 
 
 
 -linearity assumptions demand, in addition to the assumptions for the real case, that for every vector 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The extension 
 
 
 
  is in general not uniquely specified by 
 
 
 
  and the proof gives no explicit method as to how to find 
 
 
 
 . The usual proof for the case of an infinite dimensional space 
 
 
 
  uses Zorn's lemma or, equivalently, the axiom of choice. It is now known (see section 4.0) that the ultrafilter lemma, which is slightly weaker than the axiom of choice, is actually strong enough.
It is possible to relax slightly the subadditivity condition on 
 
 
 
 , requiring only that (Reed and Simon, 1980):



This reveals the intimate connection between the Hahn–Banach theorem and convexity.
The Mizar project has completely formalized and automatically checked the proof of the Hahn–Banach theorem in the HAHNBAN file.
Important consequences
The theorem has several important consequences, some of which are also sometimes called "Hahn–Banach theorem":

If 
 
 
 
  is a normed vector space with linear subspace 
 
 
 
  (not necessarily closed) and if 
 
 
 
  is continuous and linear, then there exists an extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  which is also continuous and linear and which has the same norm as 
 
 
 
  (see Banach space for a discussion of the norm of a linear map). In other words, in the category of normed vector spaces, the space 
 
 
 
  is an injective object.
If 
 
 
 
  is a normed vector space with linear subspace 
 
 
 
  (not necessarily closed) and if 
 
 
 
  is an element of 
 
 
 
  not in the closure of 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a continuous linear map 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and ψ{{!!}} {{=}} dist(z, U)−1}}.
In particular, if 
 
 
 
  is a normed vector space and if 
 
 
 
  is any element of 
 
 
 
 , then there exists a continuous linear map 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This implies that the natural injection

 
  from a reflexive normed space 
 
 
 
  into its double dual

 
  is isometric.

Hahn–Banach separation theorem
Another version of Hahn–Banach theorem is known as the Hahn–Banach separation theorem.4 It has numerous uses in convex geometry,5 optimization theory, and economics. The separation theorem is derived from the original form of the theorem.
Theorem. Set 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a topological vector space over 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  are convex, non-empty disjoint subsets of 
 
 
 
 , then:

If 
 
 
 
  is open, then there exists a continuous linear map 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  is locally convex, 
 
 
 
  is compact, and 
 
 
 
  closed, then there exists a continuous linear map 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 


Geometric Hahn–Banach theorem
One form of Hahn–Banach theorem is known as the Geometric Hahn-Banach Theorem, or Mazur's Theorem.6
Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  be a convex set having a nonempty interior in a real normed linear vector space 
 
 
 
 . Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a linear variety in 
 
 
 
  containing no interior points of 
 
 
 
 . Then there is a closed hyperplane in 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
  but containing no interior points of 
 
 
 
 ; i.e., there is an element 
 
 
 
  and a constant 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

This can be generalized to an arbitrary topological vector space, which need not be locally convex or even Hausdorff, as:7
Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  be a vector subspace of the topological vector space 
 
 
 
 . Suppose 
 
 
 
  is a non-empty convex open subset of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . Then there is a closed hyperplane 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
Relation to axiom of choice
As mentioned earlier, the axiom of choice implies the Hahn–Banach theorem. The converse is not true. One way to see that is by noting that the ultrafilter lemma (or equivalently, the Boolean prime ideal theorem), which is strictly weaker than the axiom of choice, can be used to show the Hahn–Banach theorem, although the converse is not the case.
The Hahn–Banach theorem is equivalent to the following:8

(∗): On every Boolean algebra 
 
 
 
  there exists a "probability charge", that is: a nonconstant finitely additive map from 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 .
 

(The Boolean prime ideal theorem is easily seen to be equivalent to the statement that there are always probability charges which take only the values 0 and 1.)
In ZF, one can show that the Hahn–Banach theorem is enough to derive the existence of a non-Lebesgue measurable set.9 Moreover, the Hahn–Banach theorem implies the Banach-Tarski paradox.10
For separable Banach spaces, D. K. Brown and S. G. Simpson proved that the Hahn–Banach theorem follows from WKL0, a weak subsystem of second-order arithmetic that takes a form of König's Lemma restricted to binary trees as an axiom. In fact, they prove that under a weak set of assumptions, the two are equivalent, an example of Reverse mathematics.1112
Consequences
Topological vector spaces
If 
 
 
 
  is a topological vector space, not necessarily Hausdorff or locally convex, then there exists a non-zero continuous linear form if and only if 
 
 
 
  contains a nonempty, proper, convex, open set 
 
 
 
 .13 So if the continuous dual space of 
 
 
 
 , is non-trivial then by considering 
 
 
 
  with the weak topology induced by 
 
 
 
  becomes a locally convex topological vector space with a non-trivial topology that is weaker than original topology on 
 
 
 
 . If in addition, 
 
 
 
  separates points on 
 
 
 
  (which means that for each 
 
 
 
  there is a linear functional in 
 
 
 
  that's non-zero on 
 
 
 
 ) then 
 
 
 
  with this weak topology becomes Hausdorff. This sometimes allows some results from locally convex topological vector spaces to be applied to non-Hausdorff and non-locally convex spaces.
The dual space 
 
 

We have the following consequence of the Hahn–Banach theorem.
Proposition. Let 
 
 



 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . In addition, $| F | = V ( ρ )$, where $V ( ρ )$ denotes the total variation of $ρ$.
