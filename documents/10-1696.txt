Prostaglandin-A1 Delta-isomerase

In enzymology, a prostaglandin-A1 Delta-isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(13E)-(15S)-15-hydroxy-9-oxoprosta-10,13-dienoate 
 
 
 
  (13E)-(15S)-15-hydroxy-9-oxoprosta-11,13-dienoate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (13E)-(15S)-15-hydroxy-9-oxoprosta-10,13-dienoate (Prostaglandin A1 or PGA1), and one product, (13E)-(15S)-15-hydroxy-9-oxoprosta-11,13-dienoate (Prostaglandin C1).
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases transposing C=C bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (13E)-(15S)-15-hydroxy-9-oxoprosta-10,13-dienoate Delta10-Delta11-isomerase. This enzyme is also called prostaglandin A isomerase.
