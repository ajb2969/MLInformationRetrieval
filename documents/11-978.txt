Retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase




Retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase

In enzymology, a retinol O-fatty-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acyl-CoA + retinol 
 
 
 
  CoA + retinyl ester
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and retinol, whereas its two products are CoA and retinyl ester.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:retinol O-acyltransferase. Other names in common use include retinol acyltransferase, and retinol fatty-acyltransferase. This enzyme participates in retinol metabolism.
