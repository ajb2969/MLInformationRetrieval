Glucuronate-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase

In enzymology, a glucuronate-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UTP + 1-phospho-alpha-D-glucuronate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + UDP-glucuronate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UTP and 1-phospho-alpha-D-glucuronate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and UDP-glucuronate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is UTP:1-phospho-alpha-D-glucuronate uridylyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP-glucuronate pyrophosphorylase, UDP-D-glucuronic acid pyrophosphorylase, UDP-glucuronic acid pyrophosphorylase, and uridine diphosphoglucuronic pyrophosphorylase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions and ascorbate and aldarate metabolism.
