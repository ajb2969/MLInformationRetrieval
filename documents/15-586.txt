   Nodary      Nodary   (Figure)  Nodary curve.   In physics and geometry , the nodary is the curve that is traced by the focus of a hyperbola as it rolls without slipping along the axis, a roulette curve . 1  The differential equation of the curve is      y  2   +    2  a  y     1  +   y   ′  2        =   b  2          superscript  y  2       2  a  y       1   superscript  y   normal-′  2         superscript  b  2     y^{2}+\frac{2ay}{\sqrt{1+y^{\prime 2}}}=b^{2}   . It has parametric equation       x   (  u  )    =    a   sn   (  u  ,  k  )     +    (   a  /  k   )    (     (   1  -   k  2    )   u   -   E   (  u  ,  k  )     )           x  u       a   sn  u  k        a  k         1   superscript  k  2    u     E   u  k         x(u)=a\operatorname{sn}(u,k)+(a/k)\big((1-k^{2})u-E(u,k)\big)          y   (  u  )    =    -   a   cn   (  u  ,  k  )      +    (   a  /  k   )    dn   (  u  ,  k  )            y  u         a   cn  u  k         a  k    dn  u  k       y(u)=-a\operatorname{cn}(u,k)+(a/k)\operatorname{dn}(u,k)   where    k  =   cos   (    tan   -  1     (   b  /  a   )    )        k      superscript     1      b  a       k=\cos(\tan^{-1}(b/a))   is the elliptic modulus and    E   (  u  ,  k  )       E   u  k     E(u,k)   is the incomplete elliptic integral of the second kind and sn, cn and dn are Jacobi's elliptic functions . 2  The surface of revolution is the nodoid  constant mean curvature surface .
