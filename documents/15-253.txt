Maximum common edge subgraph problem

Given two graphs

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the maximum common edge subgraph problem is the problem of finding a graph 
 
 
 
  with as many edges as possible which is isomorphic to both a subgraph of 
 
 
 
  and a subgraph of 
 
 
 
 .
The maximum common edge subgraph problem on general graphs is NP-complete as it is a generalization of subgraph isomorphism: a graph 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to a subgraph of another graph 
 
 
 
  if and only if the maximum common edge subgraph of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has the same number of edges as 
 
 
 
 . Unless the two inputs 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to the maximum common edge subgraph problem are required to have the same number of vertices, the problem is APX-hard.1
