   Maximum common edge subgraph problem      Maximum common edge subgraph problem   Given two graphs    G   G   G   and    G  ′     superscript  G  normal-′    G^{\prime}   , the maximum common edge subgraph problem is the problem of finding a graph   H   H   H   with as many edges as possible which is isomorphic to both a subgraph of   G   G   G   and a subgraph of    G  ′     superscript  G  normal-′    G^{\prime}   .  The maximum common edge subgraph problem on general graphs is NP-complete as it is a generalization of subgraph isomorphism : a graph   H   H   H   is isomorphic to a subgraph of another graph   G   G   G   if and only if the maximum common edge subgraph of   G   G   G   and   H   H   H   has the same number of edges as   H   H   H   . Unless the two inputs   G   G   G   and    G  ′     superscript  G  normal-′    G^{\prime}   to the maximum common edge subgraph problem are required to have the same number of vertices, the problem is APX-hard . 1  See also   Maximum common subgraph isomorphism problem  Subgraph isomorphism problem  Induced subgraph isomorphism problem   References  "  Category:Computational problems in graph theory     . ↩
