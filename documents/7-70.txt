Coadjoint representation

In mathematics, the coadjoint representation

 
  of a Lie group

 
  is the dual of the adjoint representation. If 
 
 
 
  denotes the Lie algebra of 
 
 
 
 , the corresponding action of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , the dual space to 
 
 
 
 , is called the coadjoint action. A geometrical interpretation is as the action by left-translation on the space of right-invariant 1-forms on 
 
 
 
 .
The importance of the coadjoint representation was emphasised by work of Alexandre Kirillov, who showed that for nilpotent Lie groups

 
  a basic role in their representation theory is played by coadjoint orbit. In the Kirillov method of orbits, representations of 
 
 
 
  are constructed geometrically starting from the coadjoint orbits. In some sense those play a substitute role for the conjugacy classes of 
 
 
 
 , which again may be complicated, while the orbits are relatively tractable.
Formal definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a Lie group and 
 
 
 
  be its Lie algebra. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the adjoint representation of 
 
 
 
 . Then the coadjoint representation

 
  is defined as 
 
 
 
 . More explicitly,


 
  for 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the value of a linear functional 
 
 
 
  on a vector 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the representation of the Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  induced by the coadjoint representation of the Lie group 
 
 
 
 . Then for 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the adjoint representation of the Lie algebra

 
 . One may make this observation from the infinitesimal version of the defining equation for 
 
 
 
  above, which is as follows :

Coadjoint orbit
A coadjoint orbit 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  in the dual space 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  may be defined either extrinsically, as the actual orbit

 
  inside 
 
 
 
 , or intrinsically as the homogeneous space

 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the stabilizer of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the coadjoint action; this distinction is worth making since the embedding of the orbit may be complicated.
The coadjoint orbits are submanifolds of 
 
 
 
  and carry a natural symplectic structure. On each orbit 
 
 
 
 , there is a closed non-degenerate 
 
 
 
 -invariant 2-form

 
  inherited from 
 
 
 
  in the following manner. Let 
 
 
 
  be an antisymmetric bilinear form on 
 
 
 
  defined by,



Then one may define 
 
 
 
  by


 
 .
The well-definedness, non-degeneracy, and 
 
 
 
 -invariance of 
 
 
 
  follow from the following facts:
(i) The tangent space 
 
 
 
  may be identified with 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Lie algebra of 
 
 
 
 .
(ii) The kernel of 
 
 
 
  is exactly 
 
 
 
 .
(iii) 
 
 
 
  is invariant under 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is also closed. The canonical 2-form

 
  is sometimes referred to as the Kirillov-Kostant-Souriau symplectic form on the coadjoint orbit.
Properties of coadjoint orbits
The coadjoint action on a coadjoint orbit 
 
 
 
  is a Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
 -action with moment map given by
