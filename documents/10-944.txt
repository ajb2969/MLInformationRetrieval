In recreational mathematics an almost integer is any number that is very close to an integer. Well-known examples of almost integers are high powers of the golden ratio

 
 , for example:











The fact that these powers approach integers is non-coincidental, which is trivially seen because the golden ratio is a Pisot-Vijayaraghavan number.
Other occurrences of non-coincidental near-integers involve the three largest Heegner numbers:











where the non-coincidence can be better appreciated when expressed in the common simple form:2








 
  where


 
  and the reason for the squares being due to certain Eisenstein series. The constant 
 
 
 
  is sometimes referred to as Ramanujan's constant.
Almost integers that involve the mathematical constants pi and e have often puzzled mathematicians. An example is
 
 
 
  To date, no explanation has been given for why Gelfond's constant ( 
 
 
 
  ) is nearly identical to 
 
 
 
 ,3 which is therefore considered a mathematical coincidence.
