   Universal representation (C*-algebra)      Universal representation (C*-algebra)   In the theory of C*-algebras , the universal representation of a C*-algebra is a faithful representation which is the direct sum of the GNS representations corresponding to the states of the C*-algebra. The various properties of the universal representation are used to obtain information about the ideals and quotients of the C*-algebra. The close relationship between an arbitrary representation of a C*-algebra and its universal representation can be exploited to obtain several criteria for determining whether a linear functional on the algebra is ultraweakly continuous. The method of using the properties of the universal representation as a tool to prove results about the C*-algebra and its representations is commonly referred to as universal representation techniques in the literature.  Formal definition and properties   Definition. Let A be a C*-algebra with state space  S . The representation     Φ  :=    ∑   ρ  ∈  S    ⊕   π  ρ       assign  normal-Φ   direct-sum   subscript     ρ  S     subscript  π  ρ      \Phi:=\sum_{\rho\in S}\oplus\;\pi_{\rho}      on the Hilbert space    H  Φ     subscript  H  normal-Φ    H_{\Phi}   is known as the universal representation of A .   As the universal representation is faithful, A is *-isomorphic to the C*-subalgebra Φ( A ) of B(H Φ ) .  States of Φ( A )  With τ a state of A , let π τ denote the corresponding GNS representation on the Hilbert space H τ . Using the notation defined here , τ is ω x ∘ π τ for a suitable unit vector x (= x τ ) in H τ . Thus τ is ω y ∘ Φ, where y is the unit vector ∑ ρ∈ S ⊕ y ρ in H Φ , defined by y τ =x, y ρ =0(ρ≠τ). Since the mapping τ → τ ∘ Φ −1 takes the state space of A onto the state space of Φ( A ), it follows that each state of Φ( A ) is a vector state .  Bounded functionals of Φ( A )  Let Φ( A ) − denote the weak-operator closure of Φ( A ) in B(H Φ ) . Each bounded linear functional ρ on Φ( A ) is weak-operator continuous and extends uniquely preserving norm, to a weak-operator continuous linear functional    ρ  ¯     normal-¯  ρ    \overline{ρ}   on the von Neumann algebra Φ( A ) − . If ρ is hermitian, or positive, the same is true of    ρ  ¯     normal-¯  ρ    \overline{ρ}   . The mapping ρ →    ρ  ¯     normal-¯  ρ    \overline{ρ}   is an isometric isomorphism from the dual space Φ( A ) * onto the predual of Φ( A ) − . As the set of linear functionals determining the weak topologies coincide, the weak-operator topology on Φ( A ) − coincides with the ultraweak topology. Thus the weak-operator and ultraweak topologies on Φ( A ) both coincide with the weak topology of Φ( A ) obtained from its norm-dual as a Banach space.  Ideals of Φ( A )  If K is a convex subset of Φ( A ), the ultraweak closure of K (denoted by K − )coincides with the strong-operator, weak-operator closures of K in B(H Φ ) . The norm closure of K is Φ( A ) ∩ K − . One can give a description of norm-closed left ideals in Φ( A ) from the structure theory of ideals for von Neumann algebras, which is relatively much more simple. If K is a norm-closed left ideal in Φ( A ), there is a projection E in Φ( A ) − such that       K  =    Φ   (  A  )    ∩   Φ    (  A  )   -   E     ,    K  -   =   Φ    (  A  )   -   E       formulae-sequence    K      normal-Φ  A     normal-Φ   superscript  A    E        superscript  K      normal-Φ   superscript  A    E      K=\Phi(A)\cap\Phi(A)^{-}E,K^{-}=\Phi(A)^{-}E   If K is a norm-closed two-sided ideal in Φ( A ), E lies in the center of Φ( A ) − .  Representations of A  If π is a representation of A , there is a projection P in the center of Φ( A ) − and a *-isomorphism α from the von Neumann algebra Φ( A ) − P onto π( A ) − such that π( a ) = α(Φ( a ) P ) for each a in A . This can be conveniently captured in the commutative diagram below :      Here ψ is the map that sends a to aP , α 0 denotes the restriction of α to Φ( A ) P , ι denotes the inclusion map.  As α is ultraweakly bicontinuous, the same is true of α 0 . Moreover, ψ is ultraweakly continuous, and is a *-isomorphism if π is a faithful representation.  Ultraweakly continuous, and singular components  Let A be a C*-algebra acting on a Hilbert space H . For ρ in A * and S in Φ( A ) − , let S ρ in A * be defined by S ρ( a ) = (Φ( a )S) for all a in A . If P is the projection in the above commutative diagram when π: A → B(H) is the inclusion mapping, then ρ in A * is ultraweakly continuous if and only if ρ = P ρ. A functional ρ in A * is said to be singular if P ρ = 0. Each ρ in A * can be uniquely expressed in the form ρ=ρ u +ρ s , with ρ u ultraweakly continuous and ρ s singular. Moreover, ||ρ||=||ρ u ||+||ρ s || and if ρ is positive, or hermitian, the same is true of ρ u , ρ s .
