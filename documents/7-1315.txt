Round function

In topology and in calculus, a round function is a scalar function

 
 , over a manifold

 
 , whose critical points form one or several connected components, each homeomorphic to the circle

 
 , also called critical loops. They are special cases of Morse-Bott functions.

For instance
For example, let 
 
 
 
  be the torus. Let



Then we know that a map



given by



is a parametrization for almost all of 
 
 
 
 . Now, via the projection 
 
 
 
  we get the restriction



 
  is a function whose critical sets are determined by



this is if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
These two values for 
 
 
 
  give the critical sets






which represent two extremal circles over the torus 
 
 
 
 .
Observe that the Hessian for this function is



which clearly it reveals itself as rank of 
 
 
 
  equal to one at the tagged circles, making the critical point degenerate, that is, showing that the critical points are not isolated.
Round complexity
Mimicking the L–S category theory one can define the round complexity asking for whether or not exist round functions on manifolds and/or for the minimum number of critical loops.
