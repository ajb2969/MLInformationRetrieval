   Conjunction elimination      Conjunction elimination   In propositional logic , conjunction elimination (also called and  elimination , ∧ elimination , 1 or simplification ) 2 3 4 is a valid  immediate inference , argument form and rule of inference which makes the inference that, if the conjunction  A and B is true, then A is true, and B is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer proofs by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself.  An example in English :   It's raining and it's pouring.  Therefore it's raining.   The rule consists of two separate sub-rules, which can be expressed in formal language as:       P  ∧  Q     ∴  P         P  Q    therefore  absent  P     \frac{P\land Q}{\therefore P}     and       P  ∧  Q     ∴  Q         P  Q    therefore  absent  Q     \frac{P\land Q}{\therefore Q}     The two sub-rules together mean that, whenever an instance of "    P  ∧  Q      P  Q    P\land Q   " appears on a line of a proof, either "   P   P   P   " or "   Q   Q   Q   " can be placed on a subsequent line by itself. The above example in English is an application of the first sub-rule.  Formal notation  The conjunction elimination sub-rules may be written in sequent notation:       (   P  ∧  Q   )   ⊢  P     proves    P  Q   P    (P\land Q)\vdash P   and       (   P  ∧  Q   )   ⊢  Q     proves    P  Q   Q    (P\land Q)\vdash Q     where   ⊢   proves   \vdash   is a metalogical symbol meaning that   P   P   P   is a syntactic consequence of    P  ∧  Q      P  Q    P\land Q   and   Q   Q   Q   is also a syntactic consequence of    P  ∧  Q      P  Q    P\land Q   in logical system ;  and expressed as truth-functional tautologies or theorems of propositional logic:       (   P  ∧  Q   )   →  P     normal-→    P  Q   P    (P\land Q)\to P   and       (   P  ∧  Q   )   →  Q     normal-→    P  Q   Q    (P\land Q)\to Q     where   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   are propositions expressed in some formal system .
