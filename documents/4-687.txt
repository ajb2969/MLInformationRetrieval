Conjunction elimination

In propositional logic, conjunction elimination (also called and elimination, ∧ elimination,1 or simplification)234 is a valid immediate inference, argument form and rule of inference which makes the inference that, if the conjunction A and B is true, then A is true, and B is true. The rule makes it possible to shorten longer proofs by deriving one of the conjuncts of a conjunction on a line by itself.
An example in English:

It's raining and it's pouring.
 
Therefore it's raining.
 

The rule consists of two separate sub-rules, which can be expressed in formal language as:



and



The two sub-rules together mean that, whenever an instance of "
 
 
 
 " appears on a line of a proof, either "
 
 
 
 
 " or "
 
 
 
 " can be placed on a subsequent line by itself. The above example in English is an application of the first sub-rule.
Formal notation
The conjunction elimination sub-rules may be written in sequent notation:


 
  and



where 
 
 
 
  is a metalogical symbol meaning that 
 
 
 
 
  is a syntactic consequence of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is also a syntactic consequence of 
 
 
 
  in logical system;
and expressed as truth-functional tautologies or theorems of propositional logic:


 
  and



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are propositions expressed in some formal system.
