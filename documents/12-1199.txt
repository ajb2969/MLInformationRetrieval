   Contact type      Contact type   In mathematics , more precisely in symplectic geometry , a hypersurface    Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   of a symplectic manifold     (  M  ,  ω  )     M  ω    (M,\omega)   is said to be of contact type if there is 1-form   α   α   \alpha   such that      j  *    (  ω  )    =   d  α          superscript  j    ω     d  α     j^{*}(\omega)=d\alpha   and    (  Σ  ,  α  )     normal-Σ  α    (\Sigma,\alpha)   is a contact manifold , where    j  :   Σ  →  M      normal-:  j   normal-→  normal-Σ  M     j:\Sigma\to M   is the natural inclusion. The terminology was first coined by Alan Weinstein .  See also   Weinstein conjecture   References  "  Category:Symplectic geometry
