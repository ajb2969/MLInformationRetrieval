Contact type

In mathematics, more precisely in symplectic geometry, a hypersurface

 
  of a symplectic manifold

 
  is said to be of contact type if there is 1-form 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a contact manifold, where 
 
 
 
  is the natural inclusion. The terminology was first coined by Alan Weinstein.
