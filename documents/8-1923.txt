   Control point (mathematics)      Control point (mathematics)   In computer-aided geometric design a control point is a member of a set of points used to determine the shape of a spline curve or, more generally, a surface or higher-dimensional object. 1  For Bézier curves , it has become customary to refer to the   d   d   d   -vectors p      i     i    {}_{i}   in a parametric representation    ∑  i     subscript   i    \sum_{i}    p     ϕ  i    i      subscript   subscript  ϕ  i   i    {}_{i}\phi_{i}   of a curve or surface in   d   d   d   -space as control points , while the scalar-valued functions    ϕ  i     subscript  ϕ  i    \phi_{i}   , defined over the relevant parameter domain, are the corresponding weight or blending functions . Some would reasonably insist, in order to give intuitive geometric meaning to the word `control', that the blending functions form a partition of unity , i.e., that the    ϕ  i     subscript  ϕ  i    \phi_{i}   are nonnegative and sum to one. This property implies that the curve lies within the convex hull of its control points. 2 This is the case for Bézier's representation of a polynomial curve as well as for the B-spline representation of a spline curve or tensor-product spline surface.
