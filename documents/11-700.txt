   Cytosine deaminase      Cytosine deaminase   In enzymology , a cytosine deaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cytosine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   uracil + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cytosine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are uracil and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cytosine aminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called isocytosine deaminase . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 13 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
