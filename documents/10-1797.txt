3-hydroxymethylcephem carbamoyltransferase

In enzymology, a 3-hydroxymethylcephem carbamoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

carbamoyl phosphate + a 3-hydroxymethylceph-3-em-4-carboxylate 
 
 
 
  phosphate + a 3-carbamoyloxymethylcephem
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are carbamoyl phosphate and 3-hydroxymethylceph-3-em-4-carboxylate, whereas its two products are phosphate and 3-carbamoyloxymethylcephem.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the carboxy- and carbamoyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carbamoyl-phosphate:3-hydroxymethylceph-3-em-4-carboxylate carbamoyltransferase. This enzyme has at least one effector, ATP.
