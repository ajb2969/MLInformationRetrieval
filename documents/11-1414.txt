   3-phosphoglyceroyl-phosphate—polyphosphate phosphotransferase      3-phosphoglyceroyl-phosphate—polyphosphate phosphotransferase   In enzymology , a 3-phosphoglyceroyl-phosphate—polyphosphate phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate + (phosphate)n   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-phosphoglycerate + (phosphate)n + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl phosphate and (phosphate)n , whereas its two products are 3-phosphoglycerate and (phosphate)n+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-phospho-D-glyceroyl-phosphate:polyphosphate phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include diphosphoglycerate-polyphosphate phosphotransferase , and 1,3-diphosphoglycerate-polyphosphate phosphotransferase .
