Desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + desulfoglucotropeolin 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + glucotropeolin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and desulfoglucotropeolin, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and glucotropeolin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase. Other names in common use include PAPS-desulfoglucosinolate sulfotransferase, 3'-phosphoadenosine-5'-phosphosulfate:desulfoglucosinolate, and sulfotransferase.
