Aspartate—phenylpyruvate transaminase

In enzymology, an aspartate-phenylpyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

L-aspartate + phenylpyruvate 
 
 
 
  oxaloacetate + L-phenylalanine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-aspartate and phenylpyruvate, whereas its two products are oxaloacetate and L-phenylalanine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-aspartate:phenylpyruvate aminotransferase. This enzyme is also called aspartate-phenylpyruvate aminotransferase.
