   (heparan sulfate)-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 3      (heparan sulfate)-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 3   In enzymology , a [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase 3 () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + [heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and heparan sulfate - glucosamine , whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and heparan sulfate - glucosamine 3-sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:[heparan sulfate]-glucosamine 3-sulfotransferase . This enzyme participates in heparan sulfate biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 .  References        "  Category:EC 2.8.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
