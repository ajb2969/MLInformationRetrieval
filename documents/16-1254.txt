   Painlevé conjecture      Painlevé conjecture   In physics , the Painlevé conjecture is a conjecture about singularities among the solutions to the n -body problem : there are noncollision singularities for n ≥ 4. 1 2  The conjecture has been proven for n ≥ 5 by Jeff Xia. 3 4 The 4-particle case remains an open problem. 5  Background and statement  Solutions    (  𝐪  ,  𝐩  )     𝐪  𝐩    (\mathbf{q},\mathbf{p})   of the n -body problem      𝐪  ˙   =    M   -  1    𝐩    ,    𝐩  ˙   =    ∇  U    (  𝐪  )        formulae-sequence     normal-˙  𝐪      superscript  M    1    𝐩       normal-˙  𝐩      normal-∇  U   𝐪      \dot{\mathbf{q}}=M^{-1}\mathbf{p},\dot{\mathbf{p}}=\nabla U(\mathbf{q})   (where M are the masses and U denotes the gravitational potential ) are said to have a singularity if there is a sequence of times    t  n     subscript  t  n    t_{n}   converging to a finite    t  *     superscript  t     t^{*}   where      ∇  U    (   𝐪   (   t  n   )    )    →  ∞     normal-→     normal-∇  U     𝐪   subscript  t  n        \nabla U(\mathbf{q}(t_{n}))\rightarrow\infty   . That is, the forces and accelerations become infinite at some finite point in time.  A collision singularity occurs if    𝐪   (  t  )       𝐪  t    \mathbf{q}(t)   tends to a definite limit when    t  →   t  *      normal-→  t   superscript  t      t\rightarrow t^{*}   tends to a definite limit as     J   (  𝐪  )    =    ∑  i     m  i     |   𝐪  i   |   2           J  𝐪     subscript   i      subscript  m  i    superscript     subscript  𝐪  i    2       J(\mathbf{q})=\sum_{i}m_{i}|\mathbf{q}_{i}|^{2}   , where   𝐪   𝐪   \mathbf{q}   is the moment of intertia . 6 This implies that a necessary condition for a noncollision singularity is that the velocity of at least one particle becomes unbounded (since the positions $\mathbf{q}$ remain finite up to this point). 7  Mather and McGehee managed to prove in 1975 that that a noncollision singularity can occur in the co-linear 4-body problem (that is, with all bodies on a line), but only after an infinite number of (regularized) binary collisions. 8  Donald G. Saari proved in 1977 that for almost all (in the sense of Lebesgue measure ) initial conditions in the plane or space for 2, 3 and 4-body problems there are singularity-free solutions. 9  In 1984 Joe Gerver gave an argument for a noncollision singularity in the planar 5-body problem with no collisions. 10 He later found a proof for the 3 n body case. 11  Finally, in his 1988 doctoral dissertation, Jeff Xia demonstrated a 5-body configuration that experiences a noncollision singularity. 12 13  Joe Gerver has given a heuristic model for the existence of 4-body singularities 14 but at present no formal proof exists.
