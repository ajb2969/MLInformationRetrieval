Painlevé conjecture

 In physics, the Painlevé conjecture is a conjecture about singularities among the solutions to the n-body problem: there are noncollision singularities for n ≥ 4.12
The conjecture has been proven for n ≥ 5 by Jeff Xia.34 The 4-particle case remains an open problem.5
Background and statement
Solutions 
 
 
 
  of the n-body problem 
 
 
 
  (where M are the masses and U denotes the gravitational potential) are said to have a singularity if there is a sequence of times 
 
 
 
  converging to a finite 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 . That is, the forces and accelerations become infinite at some finite point in time.
A collision singularity occurs if 
 
 
 
  tends to a definite limit when 
 
 
 
  tends to a definite limit as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the moment of intertia.6 This implies that a necessary condition for a noncollision singularity is that the velocity of at least one particle becomes unbounded (since the positions $\mathbf{q}$ remain finite up to this point).7
Mather and McGehee managed to prove in 1975 that that a noncollision singularity can occur in the co-linear 4-body problem (that is, with all bodies on a line), but only after an infinite number of (regularized) binary collisions.8
Donald G. Saari proved in 1977 that for almost all (in the sense of Lebesgue measure) initial conditions in the plane or space for 2, 3 and 4-body problems there are singularity-free solutions.9
In 1984 Joe Gerver gave an argument for a noncollision singularity in the planar 5-body problem with no collisions.10 He later found a proof for the 3n body case.11
Finally, in his 1988 doctoral dissertation, Jeff Xia demonstrated a 5-body configuration that experiences a noncollision singularity.1213
Joe Gerver has given a heuristic model for the existence of 4-body singularities14 but at present no formal proof exists.
