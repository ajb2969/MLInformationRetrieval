   Fiat–Shamir heuristic      Fiat–Shamir heuristic   The Fiat–Shamir heuristic is a technique in cryptography for taking an interactive proof of knowledge and creating a digital signature based on it. This way, some fact (for example, knowledge of a certain number secret to the public) can be proven without revealing underlying information. The technique is due to Fiat and Shamir (1986). 1 The original interactive proof must have the property of being public-coin , for the method to work. For the algorithm specified below, a reader should be familiar with the laws of modular arithmetic , especially with multiplicative groups of integers modulo n with prime n .  The heuristic was originally presented without a proof of security; later, Pointcheval and Stern 2 proved its security against chosen message attacks in the random oracle model , that is, under the assumption that random oracles exist. In the case that random oracles don't exist, the Fiat–Shamir heuristic has been proven insecure by Goldwasser and Kalai. 3 The Fiat–Shamir heuristic thus demonstrates a major application of random oracles. If the hash value used below does not depend on the (public) value of y , the security of the scheme is weakened, as a malicious prover can then select a certain value x so that the product cx is known. 4  More generally, the Fiat–Shamir heuristic may also be viewed as converting a public-coin interactive proof of knowledge into a non-interactive proof of knowledge . If the interactive proof is an identification protocol, then the non-interactive version can be used directly as a digital signature.  Example  Here is an interactive proof of knowledge of a discrete logarithm. 5   Alice want to prove to Bob that she knows   x   x   x   : the discrete logarithm of    y  =   g  x       y   superscript  g  x     y=g^{x}   to the base   g   g   g   .  She picks a random    v  ∈    \Z   q       v   subscript  \Z  q     v\in\Z_{q}   , computes    t  =   g  v       t   superscript  g  v     t=g^{v}   and sends   t   t   t   to Bob.  Bob picks a random    c  ∈    \Z   q  *       c   subscript   superscript  \Z    q     c\in\Z^{*}_{q}   and sends it to Alice.  Alice computes    r  =   v  -   c  x        r    v    c  x      r=v-cx   and returns   r   r   r   to Bob.  He checks if    t  ≡    g  r    y  c        t     superscript  g  r    superscript  y  c      t\equiv g^{r}y^{c}   (it holds, because      g  r    y  c    =    g   v  -   c  x      g   x  c     =   g  v   =  t           superscript  g  r    superscript  y  c       superscript  g    v    c  x      superscript  g    x  c           superscript  g  v        t     g^{r}y^{c}=g^{v-cx}g^{xc}=g^{v}=t   ).   Fiat-Shamir heuristic allows to replace the interactive step 3 with a non-interactive  random oracle access. In practice, we can use a cryptographic hash function instead. 6   Alice want to prove that she knows   x   x   x   : discrete logarithm of    y  =   g  x       y   superscript  g  x     y=g^{x}   to the base   g   g   g   .  She picks a random    v  ∈    \Z   q       v   subscript  \Z  q     v\in\Z_{q}   and computes    t  =   g  v       t   superscript  g  v     t=g^{v}   .  Alice computes    c  =   H   (  g  ,  y  ,  t  )        c    H   g  y  t      c=H(g,y,t)   , where    H   (  )       H     H()   is a cryptographic hash function.  She computes    r  =   v  -   c  x        r    v    c  x      r=v-cx   . The resulting proof is the pair    (  t  ,  r  )     t  r    (t,r)   . Since   r   r   r   is an exponent of   g   g   g   , the modulus would be    q  -  1      q  1    q-1   .  Anyone can check if    t  ≡    g  r    y  c        t     superscript  g  r    superscript  y  c      t\equiv g^{r}y^{c}   .
