   Uniformization (set theory)      Uniformization (set theory)   In set theory , the axiom of uniformization , a weak form of the axiom of choice , states that if   R   R   R   is a subset of    X  ×  Y      X  Y    X\times Y   , where   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   are Polish spaces , then there is a subset   f   f   f   of   R   R   R   that is a partial function from   X   X   X   to   Y   Y   Y   , and whose domain (in the sense of the set of all   x   x   x   such that    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   exists) equals      {   x  ∈  X   |    ∃  y   ∈   Y   (  x  ,  y  )    ∈  R   }     conditional-set    x  X         y     Y   x  y         R      \{x\in X|\exists y\in Y(x,y)\in R\}\,   Such a function is called a uniformizing function for   R   R   R   , or a uniformization of   R   R   R   .  (Figure)  Uniformization of relation R (light blue) by function f (red).   To see the relationship with the axiom of choice, observe that   R   R   R   can be thought of as associating, to each element of   X   X   X   , a subset of   Y   Y   Y   . A uniformization of   R   R   R   then picks exactly one element from each such subset, whenever the subset is nonempty . Thus, allowing arbitrary sets X and Y (rather than just Polish spaces) would make the axiom of uniformization equivalent to AC.  A pointclass    𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   is said to have the uniformization property if every relation   R   R   R   in   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   can be uniformized by a partial function in   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   . The uniformization property is implied by the scale property , at least for adequate pointclasses of a certain form.  It follows from ZFC alone that    𝚷  1  1     subscript   superscript  𝚷  1   1    \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{1}_{1}   and    𝚺  2  1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1   2    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{2}   have the uniformization property. It follows from the existence of sufficient large cardinals that       𝚷    2  n   +  1   1     subscript   superscript  𝚷  1       2  n   1     \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{1}_{2n+1}   and    𝚺    2  n   +  2   1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1       2  n   2     \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{2n+2}   have the uniformization property for every natural number    n   n   n   .  Therefore, the collection of projective sets has the uniformization property.  Every relation in L(R) can be uniformized, but not necessarily by a function in L(R). In fact, L(R) does not have the uniformization property (equivalently, L(R) does not satisfy the axiom of uniformization).  (Note: it's trivial that every relation in L(R) can be uniformized in V , assuming V satisfies AC. The point is that every such relation can be uniformized in some transitive inner model of V in which AD holds.)
