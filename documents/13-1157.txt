N-curve

We take the functional theoretic algebra C[0, 1] of curves. For each loop γ at 1, and each positive integer n, we define a curve 
 
 
 
  called n-curve. The n-curves are interesting in two ways.

Their f-products, sums and differences give rise to many beautiful curves.
Using the n-curves, we can define a transformation of curves, called n-curving.

Multiplicative inverse of a curve
A curve γ in the functional theoretic algebra C[0, 1], is invertible, i.e.



exists if



If 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , then



The set G of invertible curves is a non-commutative group under multiplication. Also the set H of loops at 1 is an Abelian subgroup of G. If 
 
 
 
 , then the mapping 
 
 
 
  is an inner automorphism of the group G.
We use these concepts to define n-curves and n-curving.
n-curves and their products
If x is a real number and [x] denotes the greatest integer not greater than x, then 
 
 

If 
 
 
 
  and n is a positive integer, then define a curve 
 
 
 
  by



 
  is also a loop at 1 and we call it an n-curve. Note that every curve in H is a 1-curve.
Suppose 
 
 
 
  Then, since 
 
 
 
 .
Example 1: Product of the astroid with the n-curve of the unit circle
Let us take u, the unit circle centered at the origin and α, the astroid. The n-curve of u is given by,



and the astroid is



The parametric equations of their product 
 
 
 
  are






See the figure.
Since both 
 
 
 
  are loops at 1, so is the product.

Example 3: n-Curve of the Rhodonea minus the Rhodonea curve
Let us take the Rhodonea Curve



If 
 
 
 
  denotes the curve,



The parametric equations of 
 
 
 
  are







n-Curving
If 
 
 
 
 , then, as mentioned above, the n-curve 
 
 
 
 . Therefore the mapping 
 
 
 
  is an inner automorphism of the group G. We extend this map to the whole of C[0, 1], denote it by 
 
 
 
  and call it n-curving with γ. It can be verified that



This new curve has the same initial and end points as α.
Example 1 of n-curving
Let ρ denote the Rhodonea curve

 
 , which is a loop at 1. Its parametric equations are






With the loop ρ we shall n-curve the cosine curve



The curve 
 
 
 
  has the parametric equations



See the figure.
It is a curve that starts at the point (0, 1) and ends at (2π, 1). 
Example 2 of n-curving
Let χ denote the Cosine Curve



With another Rhodonea Curve



we shall n-curve the cosine curve.
The rhodonea curve can also be given as



The curve 
 
 
 
  has the parametric equations






See the figure for

Generalized n-curving
In the FTA C[0, 1] of curves, instead of e we shall take an arbitrary curve 
 
 
 
 , a loop at 1. This is justified since



Then, for a curve γ in C[0, 1],


 
  and



If 
 
 
 
 , the mapping


 
  given by



is the n-curving. We get the formula



Thus given any two loops 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  at 1, we get a transformation of curve


 
  given by the above formula.
This we shall call generalized n-curving.
Example 1
Let us take 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as the unit circle ``u.’’ and 
 
 
 
  as the cosine curve



Note that 
 
 

For the transformed curve for 
 
 
 
 , see the figure.
The transformed curve 
 
 
 
  has the parametric equations

Example 2
Denote the curve called Crooked Egg by 
 
 
 
  whose polar equation is



Its parametric equations are






Let us take 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

where 
 
 
 
  is the unit circle.
The n-curved Archimedean spiral has the parametric equations
