   Order of magnitude      Order of magnitude   Orders of magnitude are written in powers of 10 . For example, the order of magnitude of 1500 is 3, since 1500 may be written as 1.5 × 10 3 .  Differences in order of magnitude can be measured on the logarithmic scale in " decades " (i.e., factors of ten). 1 Examples of numbers of different magnitudes can be found at Orders of magnitude (numbers) .   Uses  Orders of magnitude are used to make approximate comparisons. If numbers differ by 1 order of magnitude, x is about ten times different in quantity than y . If values differ by 2 orders of magnitude, they differ by a factor of about 100 . Two numbers of the same order of magnitude have roughly the same scale: the larger value is less than ten times the smaller value.

More precisely, the order of magnitude of a number can be defined in terms of the common logarithm , usually as the integer part of the logarithm, obtained by truncation . For example, the number 4,000,000 has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602; its order of magnitude is 6. When truncating, a number of this order of magnitude is between 10 6 and 10 7 . In a similar example, with the phrase "He had a seven-figure income", the order of magnitude is the number of figures minus one, so it is very easily determined without a calculator to be 6. An order of magnitude is an approximate position on a logarithmic scale .  An order-of-magnitude estimate of a variable whose precise value is unknown is an estimate rounded to the nearest power of ten. For example, an order-of-magnitude estimate for a variable between about 3 billion and 30 billion (such as the human  population of the Earth ) is 10 billion . To round a number to its nearest order of magnitude, one rounds its logarithm to the nearest integer. Thus 4,000,000, which has a logarithm (in base 10) of 6.602, has 7 as its nearest order of magnitude, because "nearest" implies rounding rather than truncation. For a number written in scientific notation, this logarithmic rounding scale requires rounding up to the next power of ten when the multiplier is greater than the square root of ten (about 3.162). For example, the nearest order of magnitude for 1.7 × 10 8 is 8, whereas the nearest order of magnitude for 3.7 × 10 8 is 9. An order-of-magnitude estimate is sometimes also called a zeroth order approximation .  An order-of-magnitude difference between two values is a factor of 10. For example, the mass of the planet Saturn is 95 times that of Earth , so Saturn is two orders of magnitude more massive than Earth. Order-of-magnitude differences are called decades when measured on a logarithmic scale .  Non-decimal orders of magnitude  Other orders of magnitude may be calculated using bases other than 10. The ancient Greeks ranked the nighttime brightness of celestial bodies by 6 levels in which each level was the fifth root of one hundred (about 2.512) as bright as the nearest weaker level of brightness, and thus the brightest level being 5 orders of magnitude brighter than the weakest indicates that it is (100 1/5 ) 5 or a factor of 100 times brighter.  The different decimal  numeral systems of the world use a larger base to better envision the size of the number, and have created names for the powers of this larger base. The table shows what number the order of magnitude aim at for base 10 and for base 1,000,000. It can be seen that the order of magnitude is included in the number name in this example, because bi- means 2 and tri- means 3 (these make sense in the long scale only), and the suffix -illion tells that the base is 1,000,000. But the number names billion, trillion themselves (here with other meaning than in the first chapter) are not names of the orders of magnitudes, they are names of "magnitudes", that is the numbers 1,000,000,000,000 etc.      order of magnitude   is log 10 of   is log 1000000 of   short scale   long scale       1   10   1,000,000   million   million     2   100   1,000,000,000,000   trillion   billion     3   1000   1,000,000,000,000,000,000   quintillion   trillion     SI units in the table at right are used together with SI prefixes , which were devised with mainly base 1000 magnitudes in mind. The IEC standard prefixes with base 1024 were invented for use in electronic technology.  The ancient apparent magnitudes for the brightness of stars uses the base     100  5   ≈  2.512         5   100   2.512    \sqrt[5]{100}\approx 2.512   and is reversed. The modernized version has however turned into a logarithmic scale with non-integer values.  Extremely large numbers  For extremely large numbers , a generalized order of magnitude can be based on their double logarithm or super-logarithm . Rounding these downward to an integer gives categories between very "round numbers", rounding them to the nearest integer and applying the inverse function gives the "nearest" round number.  The double logarithm yields the categories:   ..., 1.0023–1.023, 1.023–1.26, 1.26–10, 10–10 10 , 10 10 –10 100 , 10 100 –10 1000 , ...   (the first two mentioned, and the extension to the left, may not be very useful, they merely demonstrate how the sequence mathematically continues to the left).  The super-logarithm yields the categories:       0  -  1   ,   1  -  10   ,   10  -   10  10    ,    10  10   -   10   10  10     ,    10   10  10    -   10   10   10  10      ,  …       0  1     1  10     10   superscript  10  10       superscript  10  10    superscript  10   superscript  10  10        superscript  10   superscript  10  10     superscript  10   superscript  10   superscript  10  10      normal-…    0-1,1-10,10-10^{10},10^{10}-10^{10^{10}},10^{10^{10}}-10^{10^{10^{10}}},\dots   , or   negative numbers, 0–1, 1–10, 10–1e10, 1e10–10 1e10 , 10 1e10 – 4 10, 4 10– 5 10, etc. (see tetration )   The "midpoints" which determine which round number is nearer are in the first case:   1.076, 2.071, 1453, 4.20e31, 1.69e316,...   and, depending on the interpolation method, in the second case   −.301, .5, 3.162, 1453, 1e1453,      (  10  ↑  )   1    10  1453      fragments   superscript   fragments  normal-(  10  normal-↑  normal-)   1    superscript  10  1453     (10\uparrow)^{1}10^{1453}   ,      (  10  ↑  )   2    10  1453      fragments   superscript   fragments  normal-(  10  normal-↑  normal-)   2    superscript  10  1453     (10\uparrow)^{2}10^{1453}   ,... (see notation of extremely large numbers )   For extremely small numbers (in the sense of close to zero) neither method is suitable directly, but the generalized order of magnitude of the reciprocal can be considered.  Similar to the logarithmic scale one can have a double logarithmic scale (example provided here ) and super-logarithmic scale. The intervals above all have the same length on them, with the "midpoints" actually midway. More generally, a point midway between two points corresponds to the generalised f-mean with f ( x ) the corresponding function log log x or slog x . In the case of log log x , this mean of two numbers (e.g. 2 and 16 giving 4) does not depend on the base of the logarithm, just like in the case of log x ( geometric mean , 2 and 8 giving 4), but unlike in the case of log log log x (4 and 65536 giving 16 if the base is 2, but, otherwise).
