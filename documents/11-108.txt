   NAD+ synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)      NAD+ synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)   In enzymology , a NAD+ synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + deamido-NAD + + L-glutamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + NAD + + L-glutamate. In eukaryotes, this enzyme contains a glutaminase domain related to nitrilase. 1    The substrates of this enzyme are ATP , deamido-NAD+ , L-glutamine , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are AMP , diphosphate , NAD + , and glutamate 2  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deamido-NAD+:L-glutamine amido-ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include NAD+ synthetase (glutamine-hydrolysing) , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide synthetase (glutamine) , desamidonicotinamide adenine dinucleotide amidotransferase , and DPN synthetase . This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
