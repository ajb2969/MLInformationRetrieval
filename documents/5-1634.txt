   Linear code      Linear code   In coding theory , a linear code is an error-correcting code for which any linear combination of codewords is also a codeword. Linear codes are traditionally partitioned into block codes and convolutional codes , although turbo codes can be seen as a hybrid of these two types. 1 Linear codes allow for more efficient encoding and decoding algorithms than other codes (cf. syndrome decoding ).  Linear codes are used in forward error correction and are applied in methods for transmitting symbols (e.g., bits ) on a communications channel so that, if errors occur in the communication, some errors can be corrected or detected by the recipient of a message block. The codewords in a linear block code are blocks of symbols which are encoded using more symbols than the original value to be sent. A linear code of length n transmits blocks containing n symbols. For example, the [7,4,3] Hamming code is a linear binary code which represents 4-bit messages using 7-bit codewords. Two distinct codewords differ in at least three bits. As a consequence, up to two errors per codeword can be detected while a single error can be corrected. 2 This code contains 2 4 =16 codewords.  Definition and parameters  A linear code of length n and rank k is a linear subspace  C with dimension  k of the vector space     𝔽  q  n     superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   where    𝔽  q     subscript  𝔽  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   is the finite field with q elements. Such a code is called a q -ary code. If q = 2 or q = 3, the code is described as a binary code , or a ternary code respectively. The vectors in C are called codewords . The size of a code is the number of codewords and equals q k .  The weight of a codeword is the number of its elements that are nonzero and the distance between two codewords is the Hamming distance between them, that is, the number of elements in which they differ. The distance d of a linear code is minimum weight of its nonzero codewords, or equivalently, the minimum distance between distinct codewords. A linear code of length n , dimension k , and distance d is called an [ n , k , d ] code.  Remark: We want to give    𝔽  q  n     superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   the usual standard basis because each coordinate represents a "bit" which is transmitted across a "noisy channel" with some small probability of transmission error (a binary symmetric channel ). If some other basis is used then this model cannot be used and the Hamming metric does not measure the number of errors in transmission, as we want it to.  Generator and check matrices  As a linear subspace of    𝔽  q  n     superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   , the entire code C (which may be very large) may be represented as the span of a minimal set of codewords (known as a basis in linear algebra ). These basis codewords are often collated in the rows of a matrix G known as a generating matrix for the code C . When G has the block matrix form    G  =   (   I  k   |  A  )      fragments  G    fragments  normal-(   subscript  I  k   normal-|  A  normal-)     G=(I_{k}|A)   , where    I  k     subscript  I  k    I_{k}   denotes the    k  ×  k      k  k    k\times k   identity matrix and A is some    k  ×   (   n  -  k   )       k    n  k     k\times(n-k)   matrix, then we say G is in standard form .  A matrix H representing a linear function    ϕ  :    𝔽  q  n   →   𝔽  q   n  -  k        normal-:  ϕ   normal-→   superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    superscript   subscript  𝔽  q     n  k       \phi:\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}\to\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n-k}   whose kernel is C is called a check matrix of C (or sometimes a parity check matrix). Equivalently, H is a matrix whose null space is C . If C is a code with a generating matrix G in standard form, G = ( I k | A ), then H = (− A t | I n − k ) is a check matrix for C. The code generated by H is called the dual code of C.  Linearity guarantees that the minimum Hamming distance  d between a codeword c 0 and any of the other codewords c ≠ c 0 is independent of c 0 . This follows from the property that the difference c − c 0 of two codewords in C is also a codeword (i.e., an element of the subspace C ), and the property that d ( c , c 0 ) = d ( c − c 0 , 0). These properties imply that          min    c  ∈  C   ,   c  ≠   c  0      d    (  c  ,   c  0   )    =     min    c  ∈  C   ,   c  ≠   c  0      d    (   c  -   c  0    ,  0  )    =     min    c  ∈  C   ,   c  ≠  0     d    (  c  ,  0  )    =  d   .            subscript    formulae-sequence    c  C     c   subscript  c  0      d    c   subscript  c  0         subscript    formulae-sequence    c  C     c   subscript  c  0      d      c   subscript  c  0    0             subscript    formulae-sequence    c  C     c  0     d    c  0         d     \min_{c\in C,\ c\neq c_{0}}d(c,c_{0})=\min_{c\in C,c\neq c_{0}}d(c-c_{0},0)=%
 \min_{c\in C,c\neq 0}d(c,0)=d.     In other words, in order to find out the minimum distance between the codewords of a linear code, one would only need to look at the non-zero codewords. The non-zero codeword with the smallest weight has then the minimum distance to the zero codeword, and hence determines the minimum distance of the code.  The distance d of a linear code C also equals the minimum number of linearly dependent columns of the check matrix H .  Proof: Because     𝑯  ⋅   𝒄  T    =  𝟎       normal-⋅  𝑯   superscript  𝒄  T    0    \boldsymbol{H}\cdot\boldsymbol{c}^{T}=\boldsymbol{0}   , which is equivalent to      ∑   i  =  1   n    (    c  i   ⋅   𝑯  𝒊    )    =  𝟎        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    normal-⋅   subscript  c  i    subscript  𝑯  𝒊     0    \sum_{i=1}^{n}(c_{i}\cdot\boldsymbol{H_{i}})=\boldsymbol{0}   , where    𝑯  𝒊     subscript  𝑯  𝒊    \boldsymbol{H_{i}}   is the    i   t  h      superscript  i    t  h     i^{th}   column of   𝑯   𝑯   \boldsymbol{H}   . Remove those items with     c  i   =  0       subscript  c  i   0    c_{i}=0   , those    𝑯  𝒊     subscript  𝑯  𝒊    \boldsymbol{H_{i}}   with     c  i   ≠  0       subscript  c  i   0    c_{i}\neq 0   are linearly dependent. Therefore   d   d   d   is at least the minimum number of linearly dependent columns. On another hand, consider the minimum set of linearly dependent columns    {   𝑯  𝒋   |   j  ∈  S   }     conditional-set   subscript  𝑯  𝒋     j  S     \{\boldsymbol{H_{j}}|j\in S\}   where   S   S   S   is the column index set.      ∑   i  =  1   n    (    c  i   ⋅   𝑯  𝒊    )    =     ∑   j  ∈  S     (    c  j   ⋅   𝑯  𝒋    )    +    ∑   j  ∉  S     (    c  j   ⋅   𝑯  𝒋    )     =  𝟎          superscript   subscript     i  1    n    normal-⋅   subscript  c  i    subscript  𝑯  𝒊         subscript     j  S     normal-⋅   subscript  c  j    subscript  𝑯  𝒋       subscript     j  S     normal-⋅   subscript  c  j    subscript  𝑯  𝒋           0     \sum_{i=1}^{n}(c_{i}\cdot\boldsymbol{H_{i}})=\sum_{j\in S}(c_{j}\cdot%
 \boldsymbol{H_{j}})+\sum_{j\notin S}(c_{j}\cdot\boldsymbol{H_{j}})=\boldsymbol%
 {0}   . Now consider the vector    𝒄  ′     superscript  𝒄  bold-′    \boldsymbol{c^{\prime}}   such that     c  j    ′    =  0       superscript   subscript  c  j    normal-′    0    c_{j}^{{}^{\prime}}=0   if    j  ∉  S      j  S    j\notin S   . Note     𝒄  ′   ∈  C       superscript  𝒄  bold-′   C    \boldsymbol{c^{\prime}}\in C   because     𝑯  ⋅   𝒄   ′   T    =  𝟎       normal-⋅  𝑯   superscript   superscript  𝒄  bold-′   T    0    \boldsymbol{H}\cdot\boldsymbol{c^{\prime}}^{T}=\boldsymbol{0}   . Therefore we have    d  ≤   w  t   (   𝒄  ′   )        d    w  t   superscript  𝒄  bold-′      d\leq wt(\boldsymbol{c^{\prime}})   , which is the minimum number of linearly dependent columns in   𝑯   𝑯   \boldsymbol{H}   . The claimed property is therefore proved.  Example: Hamming codes  As the first class of linear codes developed for error correction purpose, the Hamming codes has been widely used in digital communication systems. For any positive integer    r  ≥  2      r  2    r\geq 2   , there exists a     [    2  r   -  1   ,    2  r   -  r  -  1   ,  3  ]   2     subscript      superscript  2  r   1      superscript  2  r   r  1   3   2    [2^{r}-1,2^{r}-r-1,3]_{2}   Hamming code. Since    d  =  3      d  3    d=3   , this Hamming code can correct 1-bit error.  Example : The linear block code with the following generator matrix and parity check matrix is a     [  7  ,  4  ,  3  ]   2     subscript   7  4  3   2    [7,4,3]_{2}   Hamming code.       𝑮  =   (     1 0 0 0 1 1 0      0 1 0 0 0 1 1      0 0 1 0 1 1 1      0 0 0 1 1 0 1     )    ,      𝑮    1 0 0 0 1 1 0    0 1 0 0 0 1 1    0 0 1 0 1 1 1    0 0 0 1 1 0 1      \boldsymbol{G}=\begin{pmatrix}1\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 1\ 0\\
 0\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 1\\
 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 1\ 1\\
 0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 1\ 0\ 1\end{pmatrix},       𝑯  =   (     1 0 1 1 1 0 0      1 1 1 0 0 1 0      0 1 1 1 0 0 1     )       𝑯    1 0 1 1 1 0 0    1 1 1 0 0 1 0    0 1 1 1 0 0 1      \boldsymbol{H}=\begin{pmatrix}1\ 0\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 0\ 0\\
 1\ 1\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 0\\
 0\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 1\end{pmatrix}     Example: Hadamard codes  Hadamard code is a     [   2  r   ,  r  ,   2   r  -  1    ]   2     subscript    superscript  2  r   r   superscript  2    r  1     2    [2^{r},r,2^{r-1}]_{2}   linear code and is capable of correcting many errors. Hadamard code could be constructed column by column : the    i   t  h      superscript  i    t  h     i^{th}   column is the bits of the binary representation of integer   i   i   i   , as shown in the following example. Hadamard code has minimum distance    2   r  -  1      superscript  2    r  1     2^{r-1}   and therefore can correct     2   r  -  2    -  1       superscript  2    r  2    1    2^{r-2}-1   errors.  Example : The linear block code with the following generator matrix is a     [  8  ,  3  ,  4  ]   2     subscript   8  3  4   2    [8,3,4]_{2}   Hadamard code:     𝑮   H  a  d    =   (     0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1      0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1      0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1     )        subscript  𝑮    H  a  d      0 0 0 0 1 1 1 1    0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1    0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1      \boldsymbol{G}_{Had}=\begin{pmatrix}0\ 0\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 1\ 1\ 1\\
 0\ 0\ 1\ 1\ 0\ 0\ 1\ 1\\
 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\ 0\ 1\end{pmatrix}   .  Hadamard code is a special case of Reed-Muller code . If we take the first column (the all-zero column) out from    𝑮   H  a  d      subscript  𝑮    H  a  d     \boldsymbol{G}_{Had}   , we get     [  7  ,  3  ,  4  ]   2     subscript   7  3  4   2    [7,3,4]_{2}    simplex code , which is the ''dual code '' of Hamming code.  Nearest neighbor algorithm  The parameter d is closely related to the error correcting ability of the code. The following construction/algorithm illustrates this (called the nearest neighbor decoding algorithm):  Input: A "received vector" v in    𝔽  q  n     superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   .  Output: A codeword w in C closest to v.   Enumerate the elements of the ball of (Hamming) radius t around the received word v, denoted B t (v).  For each w in B t (v), check if w in C. If so, return w as the solution!   Fail when enumeration is complete and no solution has been found.   Note: "fail" is not returned unless t > ( d − 1)/2. We say that a linear C is t -error correcting if there is at most one codeword in B t (v), for each v in    𝔽  q  n     superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   .  Popular notation  Codes in general are often denoted by the letter C , and a code of length n and of rank  k (i.e., having k code words in its basis and k rows in its generating matrix ) is generally referred to as an ( n , k ) code. Linear block codes are frequently denoted as [ n , k , d ] codes, where d refers to the code's minimum Hamming distance between any two code words.  Remark. The [ n , k , d ] notation should not be confused with the ( n , M , d ) notation used to denote a non-linear code of length n , size M (i.e., having M code words), and minimum Hamming distance d .  Singleton bound  Lemma ( Singleton bound ): Every linear [n,k,d] code C satisfies     k  +  d   ≤   n  +  1         k  d     n  1     k+d\leq n+1   .  A code C whose parameters satisfy k+d=n+1 is called maximum distance separable or MDS . Such codes, when they exist, are in some sense best possible.  If C 1 and C 2 are two codes of length n and if there is a permutation p in the symmetric group S n for which (c 1 ,...,c n ) in C 1 if and only if (c p(1) ,...,c p(n) ) in C 2 , then we say C 1 and C 2 are permutation equivalent . In more generality, if there is an    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n    monomial matrix     M  :    𝔽  q  n   →   𝔽  q  n       normal-:  M   normal-→   superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n      M\colon\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}\to\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   which sends C 1 isomorphically to C 2 then we say C 1 and C 2 are equivalent .  Lemma : Any linear code is permutation equivalent to a code which is in standard form.  Examples  Some examples of linear codes include:   Repetition codes  Parity codes  Cyclic codes  Hamming codes  Golay code , both the binary and ternary versions  Polynomial codes , of which BCH codes are an example  Reed–Solomon codes  Reed–Muller codes  Goppa codes  Low-density parity-check codes  Expander codes  Multidimensional parity-check codes   Generalization  Hamming spaces over non-field alphabets have also been considered, especially over finite rings (most notably over Z 4 ) giving rise to modules instead of vector spaces and ring-linear codes (identified with submodules ) instead of linear codes. The typical metric used in this case the Lee distance . There exist a Gray isometry between    ℤ  2   2  m      superscript   subscript  ℤ  2     2  m     \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{2m}   (i.e. GF(2 2m )) with the Hamming distance and    ℤ  4  m     superscript   subscript  ℤ  4   m    \mathbb{Z}_{4}^{m}   (also denoted as GR(4,m)) with the Lee distance; its main attraction is that it establishes a correspondence between some "good" codes that are not linear over    ℤ  2   2  m      superscript   subscript  ℤ  2     2  m     \mathbb{Z}_{2}^{2m}   as images of ring-linear codes from    ℤ  4  m     superscript   subscript  ℤ  4   m    \mathbb{Z}_{4}^{m}   . 3 4 5  More recently, some authors have referred to such codes over rings simply as linear codes as well. 6  See also   Decoding methods   References      Chapter 5 contains a more gentle introduction (than this article) to the subject of linear codes.
