   Affine curvature      Affine curvature    This article is about the curvature of affine plane curves, not to be confused with the curvature of an affine connection .    Special affine curvature , also known as the equi-affine curvature or affine curvature , is a particular type of curvature that is defined on a plane curve that remains unchanged under a special affine transformation (an affine transformation that preserves area ). The curves of constant equi-affine curvature k are precisely all non-singular plane conics . Those with k > 0 are ellipses , those with k = 0 are parabolas , and those with k 1, P 2 , P 3 , P 4 on the curve, as each of the points approaches P :         P  1   ,   P  2   ,   P  3   ,   P  4    →  P   .     normal-→    subscript  P  1    subscript  P  2    subscript  P  3    subscript  P  4    P    P_{1},P_{2},P_{3},P_{4}\to P.     In some contexts, the affine curvature refers to a differential invariant κ of the general affine group , which may readily obtained from the special affine curvature k by κ = k −3/2 d k /d s , where s is the special affine arc length. Where the general affine group is not used, the special affine curvature k is sometimes also called the affine curvature .  Formal definition  Special affine arclength  To define the special affine curvature, it is necessary first to define the special affine arclength (also called the equi-affine arclength ). Consider an affine plane curve    β   (  t  )       β  t    \beta(t)   . Choose co-ordinates for the affine plane such that the area of the parallelogram spanned by two vectors    a  =   (   a  1   ,   a  2   )       a    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2      a=(a_{1},\;a_{2})   and    b  =   (   b  1   ,   b  2   )       b    subscript  b  1    subscript  b  2      b=(b_{1},\;b_{2})   is given by the determinant        det   [    a   b   ]    =     a  1    b  2    -    a  2    b  1      .         delimited-[]    a  b          subscript  a  1    subscript  b  2       subscript  a  2    subscript  b  1       \det\left[a\;b\right]=a_{1}b_{2}-a_{2}b_{1}.     In particular, the determinant      det   [        d  β    d  t           d  2   β    d   t  2         ]             d  β     d  t         superscript  d  2   β     d   superscript  t  2         \det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{dt}&\frac{d^{2}\beta}{dt^{2}}\end{bmatrix}   is a well-defined invariant of the special affine group, and gives the signed area of the parallelogram spanned by the velocity and acceleration of the curve β. Consider a reparameterization of the curve β, say with a new parameter s related to t by means of a regular reparameterization s = s ( t ). This determinant undergoes then a transformation of the following sort, by the chain rule :      det   [       d  β    d  t         d  2   β    d   t  2        ]             d  β     d  t         superscript  d  2   β     d   superscript  t  2         \displaystyle\det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{dt}&\frac{d^{2}\beta}{dt^{2}}%
 \end{bmatrix}   The reparameterization can be chosen so that       det   [        d  β    d  s           d  2   β    d   s  2         ]    =  1              d  β     d  s         superscript  d  2   β     d   superscript  s  2        1    \det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{ds}&\frac{d^{2}\beta}{ds^{2}}\end{bmatrix}=1   provided the velocity and acceleration, dβ/d t and d 2 β/d t 2 are linearly independent . Existence and uniqueness of such a parameterization follows by integration:        s   (  t  )    =    ∫  a  t       det   [        d  β    d  t           d  2   β    d   t  2         ]    3    d  t     .        s  t     superscript   subscript   a   t        3           d  β     d  t         superscript  d  2   β     d   superscript  t  2         d  t      s(t)=\int_{a}^{t}\sqrt[3]{\det\begin{bmatrix}\frac{d\beta}{dt}&\frac{d^{2}%
 \beta}{dt^{2}}\end{bmatrix}}\,\,dt.     This integral is called the special affine arclength , and a curve carrying this parameterization is said to be parameterized with respect to its special affine arclength.  Special affine curvature  Suppose that β( s ) is a curve parameterized with its special affine arclength. Then the special affine curvature (or equi-affine curvature ) is given by        k   (  s  )    =   det   [       β  ′′    (  s  )        β  ′′′    (  s  )       ]     .        k  s          superscript  β  ′′   s      superscript  β  ′′′   s        k(s)=\det\begin{bmatrix}\beta^{\prime\prime}(s)&\beta^{\prime\prime\prime}(s)%
 \end{bmatrix}.     Here β′ denotes the derivative of β with respect to s .  More generally (; ), for a plane curve with arbitrary parameterization       t  ↦   (   x   (  t  )    ,   y   (  t  )    )    ,     maps-to  t     x  t     y  t      t\mapsto(x(t),y(t)),     the special affine curvature is:      k   (  t  )       k  t    \displaystyle k(t)     provided the first and second derivatives of the curve are linearly independent. In the special case of a graph y = y ( x ), these formulas reduce to      k  =   -    1  2     (   1    (   y  ′′   )    2  /  3     )   ′′     =     1  3     y  ′′′′     (   y  ′′   )    5  /  3      -    5  9      (   y  ′′′   )   2     (   y  ′′   )    8  /  3             k        1  2    superscript    1   superscript   superscript  y  ′′     2  3     ′′                1  3      superscript  y  ′′′′    superscript   superscript  y  ′′     5  3          5  9      superscript   superscript  y  ′′′   2    superscript   superscript  y  ′′     8  3          k=-\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{(y^{\prime\prime})^{2/3}}\right)^{\prime\prime}=%
 \frac{1}{3}\frac{y^{\prime\prime\prime\prime}}{(y^{\prime\prime})^{5/3}}-\frac%
 {5}{9}\frac{(y^{\prime\prime\prime})^{2}}{(y^{\prime\prime})^{8/3}}     where the prime denotes differentiation with respect to x (; ).  Affine curvature  Suppose as above that β( s ) is a curve parameterized by special affine arclength. There are a pair of invariants of the curve that are invariant under the full general affine group  — the group of all affine motions of the plane, not just those that are area-preserving. The first of these is       σ  =   ∫      k   (  s  )      d  s     ,      σ          k  s    d  s      \sigma=\int\sqrt{k(s)}\,ds,     sometimes called the affine arclength (although this risks confusion with the special affine arclength described above). The second is referred to as the affine curvature :       κ  =    1   k   3  /  2       d  k    d  s      .      κ      1   superscript  k    3  2         d  k     d  s       \kappa=\frac{1}{k^{3/2}}\frac{dk}{ds}.     Conics  Suppose that β( s ) is a curve parameterized by special affine arclength with constant affine curvature k . Let         C  β    (  s  )    =   [       β  ′    (  s  )        β  ′′    (  s  )       ]    .         subscript  C  β   s        superscript  β  normal-′   s      superscript  β  ′′   s       C_{\beta}(s)=\begin{bmatrix}\beta^{\prime}(s)&\beta^{\prime\prime}(s)\end{%
 bmatrix}.     Note that det C β , since β is assumed to carry the special affine arclength parameterization, and that       k  =   det   (   C  β  ′   )     .      k     superscript   subscript  C  β   normal-′      k=\det(C_{\beta}^{\prime}).\,     It follows from the form of C β that        C  β  ′   =    C  β    [     0     -  k       1    0     ]     .       superscript   subscript  C  β   normal-′      subscript  C  β     0    k     1  0       C_{\beta}^{\prime}=C_{\beta}\begin{bmatrix}0&-k\\
 1&0\end{bmatrix}.     By applying a suitable special affine transformation, we can arrange that C β (0) = I is the identity matrix. Since k is constant, it follows that C β is given by the matrix exponential       C  β    (  s  )        subscript  C  β   s    \displaystyle C_{\beta}(s)     The three cases are now as follows.   k = 0   If the curvature vanishes identically, then upon passing to a limit,        C  β    (  s  )    =   [     1    0      s    1     ]          subscript  C  β   s     1  0    s  1      C_{\beta}(s)=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
 s&1\end{bmatrix}     so β'( s ) = (1,s), and so integration gives       β   (  s  )    =   (  s  ,    s  2   /  2   )         β  s    s     superscript  s  2   2      \beta(s)=(s,s^{2}/2)\,     up to an overall constant translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the parabola y = x 2 /2.   k > 0   If the special affine curvature is positive, then it follows that        β  ′    (  s  )    =   (   cos    k   s    ,    1   k     sin    k   s     )          superscript  β  normal-′   s          k   s        1    k          k   s        \beta^{\prime}(s)=\left(\cos\sqrt{k}s,\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\sin\sqrt{k}s\right)     so that       β   (  s  )    =   (    1   k     sin    k   s     ,   -    1  k    cos    k   s      )         β  s        1    k          k   s           1  k         k   s         \beta(s)=\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{k}}\sin\sqrt{k}s,-\frac{1}{k}\cos\sqrt{k}s\right)     up to a translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the ellipse kx 2 + k 2 y 2 = 1.   k < 0   If k is negative, then the trigonometric functions in C β give way to hyperbolic functions :         C  β    (  s  )    =   [      cosh     |  k  |    s         |  k  |     sinh     |  k  |    s            1    |  k  |       sinh     |  k  |    s        cosh     |  k  |    s       ]    .         subscript  C  β   s             k    s          k            k    s           1      k             k    s             k    s        C_{\beta}(s)=\begin{bmatrix}\cosh\sqrt{|k|}s&\sqrt{|k|}\sinh\sqrt{|k|}s\\
 \frac{1}{\sqrt{|k|}}\sinh\sqrt{|k|}s&\cosh\sqrt{|k|}s\end{bmatrix}.     Thus       β   (  s  )    =   (    1    |  k  |      sinh     |  k  |    s     ,    1   |  k  |     cosh     |  k  |    s     )         β  s        1      k             k    s         1    k            k    s        \beta(s)=\left(\frac{1}{\sqrt{|k|}}\sinh\sqrt{|k|}s,\frac{1}{|k|}\cosh\sqrt{|k%
 |}s\right)     up to a translation, which is the special affine parameterization of the hyperbola        -    |  k  |    x  2     +     |  k  |   2    y  2     =  1.              k    superscript  x  2        superscript    k   2    superscript  y  2     1.    -|k|x^{2}+|k|^{2}y^{2}=1.     Characterization up to affine congruence  The special affine curvature of an immersed curve is the only (local) invariant of the curve in the following sense:   If two curves have the same special affine curvature at every point, then one curve is obtained from the other by means of a special affine transformation.   In fact, a slightly stronger statement holds:   Given any continuous function k : [ a , b ] → R , there exists a curve β whose first and second derivatives are linearly independent, such that the special affine curvature of β relative to the special affine parameterization is equal to the given function k . The curve β is uniquely determined up to a special affine transformation.   This is analogous to the fundamental theorem of curves in the classical Euclidean differential geometry of curves , in which the complete classification of plane curves up to Euclidean motion depends on a single function κ, the curvature of the curve. It follows essentially by applying the Picard–Lindelöf theorem to the system       C  β  ′   =    C  β    [     0     -  k       1    0     ]         superscript   subscript  C  β   normal-′      subscript  C  β     0    k     1  0       C_{\beta}^{\prime}=C_{\beta}\begin{bmatrix}0&-k\\
 1&0\end{bmatrix}     where C β = [β′ β′′]. An alternative approach, rooted in the theory of moving frames , is to apply the existence of a primitive for the Darboux derivative .  Derivation of the curvature by affine invariance  The special affine curvature can be derived explicitly by techniques of invariant theory . For simplicity, suppose that an affine plane curve is given in the form of a graph y = y ( x ). The special affine group acts on the Cartesian plane via transformations of the form     x   x   \displaystyle x   with ad − bc = 1. The following vector fields span the Lie algebra of infinitesimal generators of the special affine group:        T  1   =   ∂  x    ,    T  2   =   ∂  y       formulae-sequence     subscript  T  1    subscript   x       subscript  T  2     y      T_{1}=\partial_{x},\quad T_{2}=\partial y            X  1   =   x   ∂  y     ,     X  2   =   y   ∂  x     ,   H  =    x   ∂  x    -   y   ∂  y        .     formulae-sequence     subscript  X  1     x   subscript   y      formulae-sequence     subscript  X  2     y   subscript   x       H      x   subscript   x      y   subscript   y         X_{1}=x\partial_{y},\quad X_{2}=y\partial_{x},\quad H=x\partial_{x}-y\partial_%
 {y}.     An affine transformation not only acts on points, but also on the tangent lines to graphs of the form y = y ( x ). That is, there is an action of the special affine group on triples of coordinates       (  x  ,  y  ,   y  ′   )   .     x  y   superscript  y  normal-′     (x,y,y^{\prime}).\,     The group action is generated by vector fields       T  1   (  1  )    ,   T  2   (  1  )    ,   X  1   (  1  )    ,   X  2   (  1  )    ,   H   (  1  )        superscript   subscript  T  1   1    superscript   subscript  T  2   1    superscript   subscript  X  1   1    superscript   subscript  X  2   1    superscript  H  1     T_{1}^{(1)},T_{2}^{(1)},X_{1}^{(1)},X_{2}^{(1)},H^{(1)}   defined on the space of three variables ( x , y , y ′). These vector fields can be determined by the following two requirements:   Under the projection onto the xy -plane, they must to project to the corresponding original generators of the action     T  1   ,   T  2   ,   X  1   ,   X  2   ,  H      subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2    subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2   H    T_{1},T_{2},X_{1},X_{2},H   , respectively.  The vectors must preserve up to scale the contact structure of the jet space           θ  1   =    d  y   -    y  ′   d  x     .       subscript  θ  1       d  y      superscript  y  normal-′   d  x      \theta_{1}=dy-y^{\prime}dx.       Concretely, this means that the generators X (1) must satisfy       L   X   (  1  )      θ  1    ≡   0     (   mod   θ  1    )           subscript  L   superscript  X  1     subscript  θ  1     annotated  0   pmod   subscript  θ  1       L_{X^{(1)}}\theta_{1}\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\theta_{1})      where L is the Lie derivative .   Similarly, the action of the group can be extended to the space of any number of derivatives       (  x  ,  y  ,   y  ′   ,   y  ′′   ,  …  ,   y   (  k  )    )   .     x  y   superscript  y  normal-′    superscript  y  ′′   normal-…   superscript  y  k     (x,y,y^{\prime},y^{\prime\prime},\dots,y^{(k)}).   The prolonged vector fields generating the action of the special affine group must then inductively satisfy, for each generator X ∈ { T 1 , T 2 , X 1 , X 2 , H }:   The projection of X (k) onto the space of variables ( x , y , y ′,…, y ( k −1) ) is X ( k −1) .  X ( k ) preserves the contact ideal:           L   X   (  k  )      θ  k    ≡   0     (   mod    θ  1   ,  …  ,   θ  k     )           subscript  L   superscript  X  k     subscript  θ  k     annotated  0   pmod    subscript  θ  1   normal-…   subscript  θ  k        L_{X^{(k)}}\theta_{k}\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}\theta_{1},\dots,\theta_{k})       where       θ  i   =    d   y   (   i  -  1   )     -    y   (  i  )    d  x     .       subscript  θ  i       d   superscript  y    i  1        superscript  y  i   d  x      \theta_{i}=dy^{(i-1)}-y^{(i)}dx.       Carrying out the inductive construction up to order 4 gives        T  1   (  4  )    =   ∂  x    ,    T  2   (  4  )    =   ∂  y       formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  T  1   4    subscript   x       superscript   subscript  T  2   4    subscript   y      T_{1}^{(4)}=\partial_{x},\quad T_{2}^{(4)}=\partial_{y}          X  1   (  4  )    =    x   ∂  y    +   ∂   y  ′          superscript   subscript  X  1   4       x   subscript   y     subscript    superscript  y  normal-′       X_{1}^{(4)}=x\partial_{y}+\partial_{y^{\prime}}          X  2   (  4  )    =   y   ∂  x         superscript   subscript  X  2   4     y   subscript   x      \displaystyle X_{2}^{(4)}=y\partial_{x}           H   (  4  )    =    x   ∂  x    -   y   ∂  y    -   2   y  ′    ∂   y  ′     -   3   y  ′′    ∂   y  ′′     -   4   y  ′′′    ∂   y  ′′′     -   5   y  ′′′′    ∂   y  ′′′′       .       superscript  H  4       x   subscript   x      y   subscript   y      2   superscript  y  normal-′    subscript    superscript  y  normal-′       3   superscript  y  ′′    subscript    superscript  y  ′′       4   superscript  y  ′′′    subscript    superscript  y  ′′′       5   superscript  y  ′′′′    subscript    superscript  y  ′′′′        H^{(4)}=x\partial_{x}-y\partial_{y}-2y^{\prime}\partial_{y^{\prime}}-3y^{%

 \frac{5}{9}\frac{(y^{\prime\prime\prime})^{2}}{(y^{\prime\prime})^{8/3}}   does not depend explicitly on x , y , or y ′, and so satisfies        T  1   (  4  )    k   =    T  2   (  4  )    k   =    X  1   (  4  )    k   =  0.           superscript   subscript  T  1   4   k      superscript   subscript  T  2   4   k           superscript   subscript  X  1   4   k        0.     T_{1}^{(4)}k=T_{2}^{(4)}k=X_{1}^{(4)}k=0.   The vector field H acts diagonally as a modified homogeneity operator , and it is readily verified that H (4) k = 0. Finally,        X  2   (  4  )    k   =    1  2     [  H  ,   X  1   ]    (  4  )    k   =    1  2    [   H   (  4  )    ,   X   1   (  4  )     ]   k   =  0.           superscript   subscript  X  2   4   k       1  2    superscript   H    X  1    4   k            1  2     superscript  H  4     X   superscript  1  4     k        0.     X_{2}^{(4)}k=\frac{1}{2}[H,X1]^{(4)}k=\frac{1}{2}[H^{(4)},X1^{(4)}]k=0.     The five vector fields       T  1   (  4  )    ,   T  2   (  4  )    ,   X  1   (  4  )    ,   X  2   (  4  )    ,   H   (  4  )        superscript   subscript  T  1   4    superscript   subscript  T  2   4    superscript   subscript  X  1   4    superscript   subscript  X  2   4    superscript  H  4     T_{1}^{(4)},T_{2}^{(4)},X_{1}^{(4)},X_{2}^{(4)},H^{(4)}   form an involutive distribution on (an open subset of) R 6 so that, by the Frobenius integration theorem , they integrate locally to give a foliation of R 6 by five-dimensional leaves. Concretely, each leaf is a local orbit of the special affine group. The function k parameterizes these leaves.  Human Motor System  Human curvilinear 2-dimensional drawing movements tend to follow the equi-affine parametrization. 1 This is more commonly known as the two thirds power law, according to which the hand's speed is proportional to the Euclidean curvature raised to the minus third power. 2 Namely,       v  =   γ   κ   -   1  3       ,      v    γ   superscript  κ      1  3        v=\gamma\kappa^{-\frac{1}{3}},   where   v   v   v   is the speed of the hand,   κ   κ   \kappa   is the Euclidean curvature and   γ   γ   \gamma   is a constant termed the velocity gain factor.
