   Ratio test      Ratio test   In mathematics , the ratio test is a test (or "criterion") for the convergence of a series        ∑   n  =  1   ∞    a  n    ,      superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}a_{n},     where each term is a real or complex number and is nonzero when   n   n   n   is large. The test was first published by Jean le Rond d'Alembert and is sometimes known as '''d'Alembert's ratio test '''or as the Cauchy ratio test . 1  Motivation  Given the following geometric series :        ∑   n  =  1   ∞     (   1  2   )   n    =    1  2   +   1  4   +   1  8   +  ⋯         superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript    1  2   n        1  2     1  4     1  8   normal-⋯     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{4}+\frac{%
 1}{8}+\cdots     The quotient        a   n  +  1    /   a  n    =     (   1  /  2   )    n  +  1    /    (   1  /  2   )   n           subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n       superscript    1  2     n  1     superscript    1  2   n      a_{n+1}/a_{n}=(1/2)^{n+1}/(1/2)^{n}     of any two adjacent terms is 1/2. The sum of the first m terms is given by:       1  -   1   2  m     .      1    1   superscript  2  m      1-\frac{1}{2^{m}}.     As m increases, this converges to 1, so the sum of the series is 1. On the other hand given this geometric series:        ∑   n  =  1   ∞    2  n    =   2  +  4  +  8  +  ⋯         superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript  2  n      2  4  8  normal-⋯     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}2^{n}=2+4+8+\cdots   The quotient     a   n  +  1    /   a  n        subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n     a_{n+1}/a_{n}   of any two adjacent terms is 2. The sum of the first m terms is given by        2   m  +  1    -  2   ,       superscript  2    m  1    2    2^{m+1}-2,   which increases without bound as m increases, so this series diverges. More generally, the sum of the first m terms of the geometric series is given by:         ∑   n  =  1   m    r  n    =    r   r  -  1     (    r  m   -  1   )     .        superscript   subscript     n  1    m    superscript  r  n        r    r  1       superscript  r  m   1      \sum_{n=1}^{m}r^{n}=\frac{r}{r-1}(r^{m}-1).     Whether this converges or diverges as m increases depends on whether r , the quotient of any two adjacent terms, is less than or greater than 1. Now consider the series:        ∑   n  =  1   ∞      n  +  1   n     (   1  2   )   n     =     2  1   ⋅   1  2    +    3  2   ⋅   1  4    +    4  3   ⋅   1  8    +  ⋯         superscript   subscript     n  1            n  1   n    superscript    1  2   n        normal-⋅    2  1     1  2     normal-⋅    3  2     1  4     normal-⋅    4  3     1  8    normal-⋯     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{n+1}{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}=\frac{2}{1}\cdot%
 \frac{1}{2}+\frac{3}{2}\cdot\frac{1}{4}+\frac{4}{3}\cdot\frac{1}{8}+\cdots     This is similar to the first convergent sequence above, except that now the ratio of two terms is not fixed at exactly 1/2:         (     n  +  1   n     (   1  2   )   n    )   /   (    n   n  -  1      (   1  2   )    n  -  1     )    =     n  2   -  1    2   n  2     =    1  2   -   1   2   n  2       .                n  1   n    superscript    1  2   n        n    n  1     superscript    1  2     n  1           superscript  n  2   1     2   superscript  n  2              1  2     1    2   superscript  n  2         \left(\frac{n+1}{n}\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n}\right)/\left(\frac{n}{n-1}%
 \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^{n-1}\right)=\frac{n^{2}-1}{2n^{2}}=\frac{1}{2}-\frac%
 {1}{2n^{2}}.     However, as n increases, the ratio still tends in the limit towards the same constant 1/2. The ratio test generalizes the simple test for geometric series to more complex series like this one where the quotient of two terms is not fixed, but in the limit tends towards a fixed value. The rules are similar: if the quotient approaches a value less than one, the series converges, whereas if it approaches a value greater than one, the series diverges.  The test  The usual form of the test makes use of the limit {a_n}\right|.| 1 }} The ratio test states that:   if L < 1 then the series converges absolutely ;  if L > 1 then the series does not converge;  if L = 1 or the limit fails to exist, then the test is inconclusive, because there exist both convergent and divergent series that satisfy this case.   It is possible to make the ratio test applicable to certain cases where the limit L fails to exist, if limit superior and limit inferior are used. The test criteria can also be refined so that the test is sometimes conclusive even when L = 1. More specifically, let      R  =   lim   sup   |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |         R     supremum       subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n         R=\lim\sup\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|         r  =   lim   inf   |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |         r     infimum       subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n         r=\lim\inf\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|   .  Then the ratio test states that: 2 3   if R < 1, the series converges absolutely;  if r > 1, the series diverges;  if     |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |   ≥  1           subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n     1    \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|\geq 1   for all large n (regardless of the value of r ), the series also diverges; this is because    |   a  n   |       subscript  a  n     |a_{n}|   is nonzero and increasing and hence does not approach zero;  the test is otherwise inconclusive.   If the limit L in () exists, we must have L=R=r . So the original ratio test is a weaker version of the refined one.  Examples  === Convergent because L \sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{n}{e^n}  Putting this into the ratio test:      L  =    lim   n  →  ∞     |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |    =    lim   n  →  ∞     |     n  +  1    e   n  +  1      n   e  n     |    =   1  e   <  1.        L    subscript    normal-→  n          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n             subscript    normal-→  n             n  1    superscript  e    n  1       n   superscript  e  n              1  e        1.     L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|%
 \frac{\frac{n+1}{e^{n+1}}}{\frac{n}{e^{n}}}\right|=\frac{1}{e}<1.     As every term is positive, the series converges.  Divergent because L>1  Consider the series        ∑   n  =  1   ∞     e  n   n    .      superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript  e  n   n     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{e^{n}}{n}.     Putting this into the ratio test:      L  =    lim   n  →  ∞     |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |    =    lim   n  →  ∞     |     e   n  +  1     n  +  1      e  n   n    |    =  e  >  1.        L    subscript    normal-→  n          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n             subscript    normal-→  n            superscript  e    n  1      n  1       superscript  e  n   n           e       1.     L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|%
 \frac{\frac{e^{n+1}}{n+1}}{\frac{e^{n}}{n}}\right|=e>1.     Thus the series diverges.  === Inconclusive because L =1 === Consider the three series        ∑   n  =  1   ∞   1   ,      superscript   subscript     n  1      1    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1,           ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n  2     ,      superscript   subscript     n  1        1   superscript  n  2      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n^{2}},           ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )   n    1  n     .      superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1   n     1  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}\frac{1}{n}.     The first series diverges, the second one converges absolutely and the third one converges conditionally. However, the term-by-term magnitude ratios    |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |         subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n      \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|   of the three series are respectively 1,     n  2     (   n  +  1   )   2        superscript  n  2    superscript    n  1   2     \frac{n^{2}}{(n+1)^{2}}   and    n   n  +  1       n    n  1     \frac{n}{n+1}   . So, in all three cases, we have      lim   n  →  ∞     |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |    =  1        subscript    normal-→  n          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n      1    \lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|=1   . This illustrates that when L =1, the series may converge or diverge and hence the original ratio test is inconclusive. For the first series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞   1      superscript   subscript     n  1      1    \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}1   , however, as the term-by-term magnitude ratio     |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |   =  1           subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n     1    \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|=1   for all n , we can apply the third criterion in the refined version of the ratio test to conclude that the series diverges.  Proof  Below is a proof of the validity of the original ratio test.  Suppose that    L  =    lim   n  →  ∞     |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |    <  1        L    subscript    normal-→  n          subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n           1     L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|<1   . We can then show that the series converges absolutely by showing that its terms will eventually become less than those of a certain convergent geometric series . To do this, let    r  =    L  +  1   2       r      L  1   2     r=\frac{L+1}{2}   . Then r is strictly between L and 1, and     |   a   n  +  1    |   <   r   |   a  n   |           subscript  a    n  1       r     subscript  a  n       |a_{n+1}|   for sufficiently large n (say, n greater than N). Hence     |   a   n  +  i    |   <    r  i    |   a  n   |           subscript  a    n  i        superscript  r  i      subscript  a  n       |a_{n+i}|   for each n > N and i > 0 , and so         ∑   i  =   N  +  1    ∞    |   a  i   |    =    ∑   i  =  1   ∞    |   a   N  +  i    |    <    ∑   i  =  1   ∞     r  i    |   a   N  +  1    |     =    |   a   N  +  1    |     ∑   i  =  1   ∞    r  i     =    |   a   N  +  1    |    r   1  -  r     <  ∞   .          superscript   subscript     i    N  1          subscript  a  i       superscript   subscript     i  1         subscript  a    N  i             superscript   subscript     i  1         superscript  r  i      subscript  a    N  1                 subscript  a    N  1       superscript   subscript     i  1       superscript  r  i               subscript  a    N  1       r    1  r              \sum_{i=N+1}^{\infty}|a_{i}|=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}\left|a_{N+i}\right|<\sum_{i=1%
 }^{\infty}r^{i}|a_{N+1}|=|a_{N+1}|\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}r^{i}=|a_{N+1}|\frac{r}{1%
 -r}<\infty.     That is, the series converges absolutely.  On the other hand, if L > 1, then     |   a   n  +  1    |   >   |   a  n   |          subscript  a    n  1        subscript  a  n      |a_{n+1}|>|a_{n}|   for sufficiently large n, so that the limit of the summands is non-zero. Hence the series diverges.  == Extensions for L = 1 ==  As seen in the previous example, the ratio test may be inconclusive when the limit of the ratio is 1. Extensions to ratio test, however, sometimes allows one to deal with this case. For instance, the aforementioned refined version of the test handles the case       |    a   n  +  1     a  n    |   ≥  1.           subscript  a    n  1     subscript  a  n     1.    \left|\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_{n}}\right|\geq 1.     Below are some other extensions.  Raabe's test  This extension is due to Joseph Ludwig Raabe . It states that if         lim   n  →  ∞     |    a  n    a   n  +  1     |    =  1   ,        subscript    normal-→  n          subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1       1    \lim_{n\to\infty}\left|\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}\right|=1,            lim   n  →  ∞     n   (    |    a  n    a   n  +  1     |   -  1   )     =  R   ,        subscript    normal-→  n       n         subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1      1     R    \lim_{n\to\infty}n\left(\left|\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}\right|-1\right)=R,     then the series will be absolutely convergent if R>1 and divergent if R http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RaabesTest.html d'Alembert's ratio test and Raabe's test are the first and second theorems in a hierarchy of such theorems due to Augustus De Morgan .  Proof of Raabe's test  Let    R  >  p  >  1        R  p       1     R>p>1   . Then:        lim   n  →  ∞     n   (    |    a  n    a   n  +  1     |   -  1   )     =  R  >  p  =    lim   n  →  ∞     n   (     (   1  +   1  n    )   p   -  1   )             subscript    normal-→  n       n         subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1      1     R       p         subscript    normal-→  n       n     superscript    1    1  n    p   1        \lim_{n\to\infty}n\left(\left|\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}\right|-1\right)=R>p=\lim_{%
 n\to\infty}n\left(\left(1+\frac{1}{n}\right)^{p}-1\right)           ⇒   n   (    |    a  n    a   n  +  1     |   -  1   )     >   n   (     (   1  +   1  n    )   p   -  1   )      for large  n      formulae-sequence     normal-⇒    n         subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1      1       n     superscript    1    1  n    p   1       for large  n     \Rightarrow\quad n\left(\left|\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}\right|-1\right)>n\left(%

The divergence for    R  <  1      R  1    R<1   follows by comparing with the harmonic series . 4  Higher order tests  The next cases in de Morgan's hierarchy are Bertrand's and Gauss's test. Each test involves slightly different higher order asymptotics. Bertrand's test asserts that if       |    a  n    a   n  +  1     |   =   1  +   1  n   +    ρ  n    n   ln  n               subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1        1    1  n      subscript  ρ  n     n    n        \left|\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}\right|=1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{\rho_{n}}{n\ln n}   then the series converges if lim inf ρ n > 1, and diverges if lim sup ρ n  http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BertrandsTest.html  Gauss's test asserts that if       |    a  n    a   n  +  1     |   =   1  +   h  n   +    C  n    n  r              subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1        1    h  n      subscript  C  n    superscript  n  r       \left|\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}\right|=1+\frac{h}{n}+\frac{C_{n}}{n^{r}}   where r > 1 and C n is bounded, then the series converges if h > 1 and diverges if h ≤ 1. 5  These are both special cases of Kummer's test for the convergence of the series Σ a n , for positive a n . Let ζ n be an auxiliary sequence of positive constants. Let       ρ  =    lim   n  →  ∞     (     ζ  n     a  n    a   n  +  1      -   ζ   n  +  1     )     .      ρ    subscript    normal-→  n          subscript  ζ  n      subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1       subscript  ζ    n  1        \rho=\lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\zeta_{n}\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}-\zeta_{n+1}\right).     Then if ρ > 0, the series converges. If ρ  n diverges, then the series diverges. Otherwise the test is inconclusive. 6  Proof of Kummer's test  If    ρ  >  0      ρ  0    \rho>0   then fix a positive number    0  <  δ  <  ρ        0  δ       ρ     0<\delta<\rho   . There exists a natural number    N  0     subscript  N  0    N_{0}   such that for every    n  >   N  0       n   subscript  N  0     n>N_{0}   we have       δ  ≤     ζ  n     a  n    a   n  +  1      -   ζ   n  +  1      .      δ       subscript  ζ  n      subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1       subscript  ζ    n  1       \delta\leq\zeta_{n}\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n+1}}-\zeta_{n+1}.   Since     a   n  +  1    >  0       subscript  a    n  1    0    a_{n+1}>0   we obtain that for every    n  >   N  0       n   subscript  N  0     n>N_{0}   holds:       0  ≤   δ   a   n  +  1     ≤     ζ  n    a  n    -    ζ   n  +  1     a   n  +  1       .        0    δ   subscript  a    n  1               subscript  ζ  n    subscript  a  n       subscript  ζ    n  1     subscript  a    n  1         0\leq\delta a_{n+1}\leq\zeta_{n}a_{n}-\zeta_{n+1}a_{n+1}.   In particular      ζ   n  +  1     a   n  +  1     ≤    ζ  n    a  n           subscript  ζ    n  1     subscript  a    n  1        subscript  ζ  n    subscript  a  n      \zeta_{n+1}a_{n+1}\leq\zeta_{n}a_{n}   for all    n  ≥   N  0       n   subscript  N  0     n\geq N_{0}   which means that starting from the index    N  0     subscript  N  0    N_{0}   the sequence      ζ  n    a  n    >  0         subscript  ζ  n    subscript  a  n    0    \zeta_{n}a_{n}>0   is monotonically decreasing and positive which in particular implies that it is bounded below by 0. Therefore the limit        lim   n  →  ∞      ζ  n    a  n     =  L        subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  ζ  n    subscript  a  n     L    \lim_{n\to\infty}\zeta_{n}a_{n}=L   exists. This implies that the positive telescoping series       ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (     ζ  n    a  n    -    ζ   n  +  1     a   n  +  1      )       superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  ζ  n    subscript  a  n       subscript  ζ    n  1     subscript  a    n  1        \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\Big(\zeta_{n}a_{n}-\zeta_{n+1}a_{n+1}\Big)   are convergent, and since for all    n  >   N  0       n   subscript  N  0     n>N_{0}   we have       δ   a   n  +  1     ≤     ζ  n    a  n    -    ζ   n  +  1     a   n  +  1            δ   subscript  a    n  1          subscript  ζ  n    subscript  a  n       subscript  ζ    n  1     subscript  a    n  1        \delta a_{n+1}\leq\zeta_{n}a_{n}-\zeta_{n+1}a_{n+1}   by the Direct comparison test for positive series we conclude that the series     ∑   n  =  1   ∞    δ   a   n  +  1         superscript   subscript     n  1        δ   subscript  a    n  1       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\delta a_{n+1}   are convergent.  On the other hand, if    ρ  <  0      ρ  0    \rho<0   , then there is an N such that     ζ  n    a  n        subscript  ζ  n    subscript  a  n     \zeta_{n}a_{n}   is increasing for    n  >  N      n  N    n>N   . In particular, there exists an    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   for which      ζ  n    a  n    >  ϵ         subscript  ζ  n    subscript  a  n    ϵ    \zeta_{n}a_{n}>\epsilon   for all    n  >  N      n  N    n>N   , and so      ∑  n    a  n    =   ∑     a  n    ζ  n    /   ζ  n           subscript   n    subscript  a  n           subscript  a  n    subscript  ζ  n     subscript  ζ  n       \sum_{n}a_{n}=\sum a_{n}\zeta_{n}/\zeta_{n}   diverges by comparison with     ∑  n    ϵ  /   ζ  n        subscript   n     ϵ   subscript  ζ  n      \sum_{n}\epsilon/\zeta_{n}   .
