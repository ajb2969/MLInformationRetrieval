Ratio test

In mathematics, the ratio test is a test (or "criterion") for the convergence of a series



where each term is a real or complex number and  is nonzero when 
 
 
 
  is large. The test was first published by Jean le Rond d'Alembert and is sometimes known as '''d'Alembert's ratio test '''or as the Cauchy ratio test.1
Motivation
Given the following geometric series:



The quotient



of any two adjacent terms is 1/2. The sum of the first m terms is given by:



As m increases, this converges to 1, so the sum of the series is 1. On the other hand given this geometric series:


 
  The quotient 
 
 
 
  of any two adjacent terms is 2. The sum of the first m terms is given by


 
  which increases without bound as m increases, so this series diverges. More generally, the sum of the first m terms of the geometric series is given by:



Whether this converges or diverges as m increases depends on whether r, the quotient of any two adjacent terms, is less than or greater than 1. Now consider the series:



This is similar to the first convergent sequence above, except that now the ratio of two terms is not fixed at exactly 1/2:



However, as n increases, the ratio still tends in the limit towards the same constant 1/2. The ratio test generalizes the simple test for geometric series to more complex series like this one where the quotient of two terms is not fixed, but in the limit tends towards a fixed value. The rules are similar: if the quotient approaches a value less than one, the series converges, whereas if it approaches a value greater than one, the series diverges.
The test
The usual form of the test makes use of the limit {a_n}\right|.|1}} The ratio test states that:

if L < 1 then the series converges absolutely;
if L > 1 then the series does not converge;
if L = 1 or the limit fails to exist, then the test is inconclusive, because there exist both convergent and divergent series that satisfy this case.

It is possible to make the ratio test applicable to certain cases where the limit L fails to exist, if limit superior and limit inferior are used. The test criteria can also be refined so that the test is sometimes conclusive even when L = 1. More specifically, let





 
 .
Then the ratio test states that:23

if R < 1, the series converges absolutely;
if r > 1, the series diverges;
if 
 
 
 
  for all large n (regardless of the value of r), the series also diverges; this is because 
 
 
 
  is nonzero and increasing and hence  does not approach zero;
the test is otherwise inconclusive.

If the limit L in () exists, we must have L=R=r. So the original ratio test is a weaker version of the refined one.
Examples
=== Convergent because L\sum_{n=1}^\infty\frac{n}{e^n}
Putting this into the ratio test:



As every term is positive, the series converges.
Divergent because L>1
Consider the series



Putting this into the ratio test:



Thus the series diverges.
=== Inconclusive because L=1 === Consider the three series









The first series diverges, the second one converges absolutely and the third one converges conditionally. However, the term-by-term magnitude ratios 
 
 
 
  of the three series are respectively 1,    
 
 
 
     and 
 
 
 
 . So, in all three cases, we have
 
 
 
 . This illustrates that when L=1, the series may converge or diverge and hence the original ratio test is inconclusive. For the first series 
 
 
 
 , however, as the term-by-term magnitude ratio 
 
 
 
  for all n, we can apply the third criterion in the refined version of the ratio test to conclude that the series diverges.
Proof
 Below is a proof of the validity of the original ratio test.
Suppose that 
 
 
 
 . We can then show that the series converges absolutely by showing that its terms will eventually become less than those of a certain convergent geometric series. To do this, let 
 
 
 
 . Then r is strictly between L and 1, and 
 
 
 
  for sufficiently large n (say, n greater than N). Hence 
 
 
 
  for each n > N and i > 0, and so



That is, the series converges absolutely.
On the other hand, if L > 1, then 
 
 
 
  for sufficiently large n, so that the limit of the summands is non-zero. Hence the series diverges.
== Extensions for L = 1 == 
As seen in the previous example, the ratio test may be inconclusive when the limit of the ratio is 1. Extensions to ratio test, however, sometimes allows one to deal with this case. For instance, the aforementioned refined version of the test handles the case



Below are some other extensions.
Raabe's test
This extension is due to Joseph Ludwig Raabe. It states that if






then the series will be absolutely convergent if R>1 and divergent if Rhttp://mathworld.wolfram.com/RaabesTest.html d'Alembert's ratio test and Raabe's test are the first and second theorems in a hierarchy of such theorems due to Augustus De Morgan.
Proof of Raabe's test
Let 
 
 
 
 . Then:








 
  and since the  p-series

 
  converges for 
 
 
 
  the series 
 
 
 
  converges for 
 
 
 
 . The divergence for 
 
 
 
  follows by comparing with the harmonic series.4
Higher order tests
The next cases in de Morgan's hierarchy are Bertrand's and Gauss's test. Each test involves slightly different higher order asymptotics. Bertrand's test asserts that if


 
  then the series converges if lim inf ρn > 1, and diverges if lim sup ρn http://mathworld.wolfram.com/BertrandsTest.html
Gauss's test asserts that if


 
  where r > 1 and Cn is bounded, then the series converges if h > 1 and diverges if h ≤ 1.5
These are both special cases of Kummer's test for the convergence of the series Σan, for positive an. Let ζn be an auxiliary sequence of positive constants. Let



Then if ρ > 0, the series converges. If ρ n diverges, then the series diverges. Otherwise the test is inconclusive.6
Proof of Kummer's test
If 
 
 
 
  then fix a positive number 
 
 
 
 . There exists a natural number 
 
 
 
  such that for every 
 
 
 
  we have


 
  Since 
 
 
 
  we obtain that for every 
 
 
 
  holds:


 
  In particular 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  which means that starting from the index 
 
 
 
  the sequence 
 
 
 
  is monotonically decreasing and positive which in particular implies that it is bounded below by 0. Therefore the limit


 
  exists. This implies that the positive telescoping series


 
  are convergent, and since for all 
 
 
 
  we have


 
  by the Direct comparison test for positive series we conclude that the series 
 
 
 
  are convergent.
On the other hand, if 
 
 
 
 , then there is an N such that 
 
 
 
  is increasing for 
 
 
 
 . In particular, there exists an 
 
 
 
  for which 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and so 
 
 
 
  diverges by comparison with 
 
 
 
 .
