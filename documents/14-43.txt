Reflectance difference spectroscopy

Reflectance difference spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique which measures the difference in reflectance of two beams of light that are shone in normal incident on a surface with different linear polarizations.1 It is also known as reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS).2
It is calculated as:



 
  and 
 
 
 
  are reflectance in two different polarizations.
