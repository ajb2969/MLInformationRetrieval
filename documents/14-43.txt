   Reflectance difference spectroscopy      Reflectance difference spectroscopy   Reflectance difference spectroscopy is a spectroscopic technique which measures the difference in reflectance of two beams of light that are shone in normal incident on a surface with different linear polarizations . 1 It is also known as reflectance anisotropy spectroscopy (RAS). 2  It is calculated as:       R  D  S   =   2     r  α   -   r  β      r  α   +   r  β            R  D  S     2       subscript  r  α    subscript  r  β       subscript  r  α    subscript  r  β        RDS=2\frac{r_{\alpha}-r_{\beta}}{r_{\alpha}+r_{\beta}}       r  α     subscript  r  α    r_{\alpha}   and    r  β     subscript  r  β    r_{\beta}   are reflectance in two different polarizations.
