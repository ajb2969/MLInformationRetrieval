   Signed distance function      Signed distance function   In mathematics and applications, the signed distance function of a set Ω in a metric space , also called the oriented distance function , determines the distance of a given point x from the boundary of Ω , with the sign determined by whether x is in Ω . The function has positive values at points x inside Ω , it decreases in value as x approaches the boundary of Ω where the signed distance function is zero, and it takes negative values outside of Ω .  Definition  If ( Ω , d ) is a metric space, the signed distance function  f is defined by       f   (  x  )    =   {      d   (  x  ,   Ω  c   )        if  x   ∈  Ω        -   d   (  x  ,  Ω  )         if  x   ∈   Ω  c              f  x    cases    d   x   superscript  normal-Ω  c         if  x   normal-Ω       d   x  normal-Ω         if  x    superscript  normal-Ω  c       f(x)=\begin{cases}d(x,\Omega^{c})&\mbox{ if }x\in\Omega\\
 -d(x,\Omega)&\mbox{ if }x\in\Omega^{c}\end{cases}     where       d   (  x  ,  Ω  )    =    inf   y  ∈  Ω     d   (  x  ,  y  )           d   x  normal-Ω      subscript  infimum    y  normal-Ω      d   x  y       d(x,\Omega)=\inf_{y\in\Omega}d(x,y)     and inf denotes the infimum .  Properties in Euclidean space  If Ω is a subset of the Euclidean space  R n with piecewise  smooth boundary, then the signed distance function is differentiable almost everywhere , and its gradient satisfies the eikonal equation       |   ∇  f   |   =  1.         normal-∇  f    1.    |\nabla f|=1.     If the boundary of Ω is C k for k ≥2 (see differentiability classes ) then d is C k on points sufficiently close to the boundary of Ω . In particular, on the boundary f satisfies         ∇  f    (  x  )    =   N   (  x  )     ,         normal-∇  f   x     N  x     \nabla f(x)=N(x),     where N is the inward normal vector field. The signed distance function is thus a differentiable extension of the normal vector field. In particular, the Hessian of the signed distance function on the boundary of Ω gives the Weingarten map .  If, further, Γ is a region sufficiently close to the boundary of Ω that f is twice continuously differentiable on it, then there is an explicit formula involving the Weingarten map W x for the Jacobian of changing variables in terms of the signed distance function and nearest boundary point. Specifically, if T (∂ Ω , μ ) is the set of points within distance μ of the boundary of Ω (i.e. the tubular neighbourhood of radius μ ), and g is an absolutely integrable function on Γ , then         ∫   T   (   ∂  Ω   ,  μ  )      g   (  x  )   d  x    =    ∫   ∂  Ω      ∫   -  μ   μ    g   (   u  +   λ  N   (  u  )     )    det    (   I  -   λ   W  u     )   d   λ   d   S  u         ,        subscript     T     normal-Ω   μ       g  x  d  x      subscript     normal-Ω      superscript   subscript     μ    μ     g    u    λ  N  u          I    λ   subscript  W  u     d  λ  d   subscript  S  u          \int_{T(\partial\Omega,\mu)}g(x)\,dx=\int_{\partial\Omega}\int_{-\mu}^{\mu}g(u%

Algorithms  Algorithms for calculating the signed distance function include the efficient fast marching method , fast sweeping method 1 and the more general level set method .  Applications  Signed distance functions are applied for example in computer vision .  They have also recently been used in a method (advanced by Valve Software ) to render smooth fonts at large sizes (or alternatively at high DPI ) using GPU acceleration. 2 Valve's method computed signed distance fields in raster space in order to avoid of the computational complexity of solving the problem in the (continuous) vector space. More recently piece-wise approximation solutions have been proposed (which for example approximate a Bezier with arc splines), but even this way the computation can be too slow for real-time rendering , and it has to be assisted by grid-based discretization techniques to approximate (and cull from the computation) the distance to points that are too far away. 3  See also   Level set method  Eikonal equation  Parallel (aka offset) curve   Notes  References     (or the Appendix of the 1977 1st ed.)
