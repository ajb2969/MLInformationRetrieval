(+)-car-3-ene synthase

(+)-car-3-ene synthase (, 3-carene cyclase, 3-carene synthase, 3CAR, (+)-3-carene synthase) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (+)-car-3-ene-forming).123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranyl diphosphate

 
  (+)-car-3-ene + diphosphate


The enzyme reacts with (3S)-linalyl diphosphate twice as rapidly as geranyl diphosphate.
