   (+)-car-3-ene synthase      (+)-car-3-ene synthase   (+)-car-3-ene synthase (, 3-carene cyclase , 3-carene synthase , 3CAR , (+)-3-carene synthase ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (+)-car-3-ene-forming) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+)-car-3-ene + diphosphate    The enzyme reacts with (3S)-linalyl diphosphate twice as rapidly as geranyl diphosphate.
