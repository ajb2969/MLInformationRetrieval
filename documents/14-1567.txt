   Electromigrated nanogaps      Electromigrated nanogaps   Electromigrated Nanogaps are gaps formed in metallic bridges formed by the process of electromigration .  Theory  A nanosized contact formed by electromigration acts like a waveguide for electrons. The nanocontact essentially acts like a one-dimensional wire with a conductance of    G  =    2   e  2    /  h       G      2   superscript  e  2    h     G=2e^{2}/h   . The current in a wire is the velocity of the electrons multiplied by the charge and number per unit length,    I  =    v  e  N   /  L       I      v  e  N   L     I=veN/L   or    G  =     v  e  N   /  L   V       G        v  e  N   L   V     G=veN/LV   . This gives a conductance of    G  =     v   e  2   N   /  L   E       G        v   superscript  e  2   N   L   E     G=ve^{2}N/LE   . In nano scale bridges the conductance falls in discrete steps of multiples of the quantum conductance    G  =    2   e  2    /  h       G      2   superscript  e  2    h     G=2e^{2}/h   .  Uses   Electromigrated Nanogaps have shown great promise as electrodes in use in molecular scale electronics. 1    Researcher have used feedback controlled electromigration to investigate the magnetoresistance of a quantum spin valve .
