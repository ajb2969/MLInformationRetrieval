A circular sector or circle sector (symbol: ⌔), is the portion of a disk enclosed by two radii and an arc, where the smaller area is known as the minor sector and the larger being the major sector. In the diagram, θ is the central angle in radians, 
 
 
 
  the radius of the circle, and 
 
 
 
  is the arc length of the minor sector.
A sector with the central angle of 180° is called a half-disk and is bounded by a diameter and a semicircle. Sectors with other central angles are sometimes given special names, these include quadrants (90°), sextants (60°) and octants (45°).
The angle formed by connecting the endpoints of the arc to any point on the circumference that is not in the sector is equal to half the central angle.
Area
The total area of a circle is 
 
 
 
 . The area of the sector can be obtained by multiplying the circle's area by the ratio of the angle and 
 
 
 
  (because the area of the sector is proportional to the angle, and 
 
 
 
  is the angle for the whole circle, in radians):


 
  The area of a sector in terms of 
 
 
 
  can be obtained by multiplying the total area 
 
 
 
 by the ratio of 
 
 
 
 
  to the total perimeter 
 
 
 
 .



Another approach is to consider this area as the result of the following integral :



Converting the central angle into degrees gives



Arc length
The length L of the arc of a sector is given by



where θ is in radians.
If the angle is given in degrees, then



Perimeter
The length of the perimeter of a sector is the sum of the arc length and the two radii:



where θ is in radians.
