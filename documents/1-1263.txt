   Coherence length      Coherence length   In physics , coherence length is the propagation distance over which a coherent wave (e.g. an electromagnetic wave ) maintains a specified degree of coherence . Wave interference is strong when the paths taken by all of the interfering waves differ by less than the coherence length. A wave with a longer coherence length is closer to a perfect sinusoidal wave. Coherence length is important in holography and telecommunications engineering .  This article focuses on the coherence of classical electromagnetic fields. In quantum mechanics , there is a mathematically analogous concept of the quantum coherence length of a wave function .  Formulas  In radio-band systems, the coherence length is approximated by       L  =   c    n   Δ  f     ,      L    c    n  normal-Δ  f      L={c\over n\,\Delta f},     where c is the speed of light in a vacuum, n is the refractive index of the medium , and    Δ  f      normal-Δ  f    \Delta f   is the bandwidth of the source.  In optical communications , the coherence length   L   L   L   is given by 1       L  =     2   ln   (  2  )      π  n      λ  2    Δ  λ      ,      L        2    2      π  n       superscript  λ  2     normal-Δ  λ       L={2\ln(2)\over\pi n}{\lambda^{2}\over\Delta\lambda},     where   λ   λ   \lambda   is the central wavelength of the source,   n   n   n   is the refractive index of the medium , and    Δ  λ      normal-Δ  λ    \Delta\lambda   is the spectral width of the source. If the source has a Gaussian spectrum with FWHM spectral width    Δ  λ      normal-Δ  λ    \Delta\lambda   , then a path offset of ±   L   L   L   will reduce the fringe visibility to 50%.  Coherence length is usually applied to the optical regime.  The expression above is a frequently used approximation. Due to ambiguities in the definition of spectral width of a source, however, the following definition of coherence length has been suggested:  The coherence length can be measured using a Michelson interferometer and is the optical path length difference of a self-interfering laser beam which corresponds to a     1  /  e   =   37  %         1  e    percent  37     1/e=37\%   fringe visibility, 2 where the fringe visibility is defined as       V  =     I  max   -   I  min      I  max   +   I  min      ,      V       subscript  I     subscript  I        subscript  I     subscript  I        V={I_{\max}-I_{\min}\over I_{\max}+I_{\min}},\,     where   I   I   I   is the fringe intensity.  In long-distance transmission systems, the coherence length may be reduced by propagation factors such as dispersion , scattering , and diffraction .  Lasers  Multimode helium–neon lasers have a typical coherence length of 20 cm, while the coherence length of singlemode ones can exceed 100 m. Semiconductor lasers reach some 100 m. Singlemode fiber lasers with linewidths of a few kHz can have coherence lengths exceeding 100 km. Similar coherence lengths can be reached with optical frequency combs due to the narrow linewidth of each tooth. Non-zero visibility is present only for short intervals of pulses repeated after cavity length distances up to this long coherence length.
