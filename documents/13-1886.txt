   Sample matrix inversion      Sample matrix inversion   Sample matrix inversion (or direct matrix inversion ) is an algorithm that estimates weights of an array ( adaptive filter ) by replacing the correlation matrix  R u with its estimate. Using K samples       x   (  k  )    ,  k   =  1   ,   2  ,  …  ,   K  -  1       formulae-sequence       x  k   k   1    2  normal-…    K  1      x(k),k=1,2,\dots,K-1   , an unbiased estimate of R u , the correlation matrix of the array signals, may be obtained by means of a simple averaging scheme:          R  ^   u    (  k  )    =    (   1  /  k   )    ∑   (   x   (  k  )    x  H    (  k  )    )      .         subscript   normal-^  R   u   k       1  k       x  k   superscript  x  H   k       \hat{R}_{u}(k)=(1/k)\sum(x(k)x^{H}(k)).   The expression of the theoretically optimal weights requires the inverse of R u , and the inverse of the estimates matrix is then used for finding estimated optimal weights.
