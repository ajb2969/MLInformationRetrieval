   Strange–Rahman–Smith equation      Strange–Rahman–Smith equation   The Strange–Rahman–Smith equation is used in the cryoporometry method of measuring porosity . NMR cryoporometry  1 2 3 is a recent technique for measuring total porosity and pore size distributions. NMRC is based on two equations, the Gibbs–Thomson equation , that maps the melting point depression to pore size, and the Strange–Rahman–Smith equation 4 that maps the melted signal amplitude at a particular temperature to pore volume.  Equation  If the pores of the porous material are filled with a liquid, then the incremental volume of the pores    Δ  v      normal-Δ  v    \Delta v   with pore diameter between   x   x   x   and    x  +    Δ   x       x    normal-Δ  x     x+\Delta\,x   may be obtained from the increase in melted liquid volume for an increase of temperature between   T   T   T   and    T  +   Δ  T       T    normal-Δ  T     T+\Delta T   by: 5       d  v    d  x    =    d   v    k   G  T       d    T    x  2             d  v     d  x        d  v   subscript  k    G  T       d  T   superscript  x  2       \frac{dv}{dx}=\frac{dv\,k_{GT}}{d\,T\,x^{2}}     Where    k   G  T      subscript  k    G  T     k_{GT}   is the Gibbs–Thomson coefficient for the liquid in the pores.
