   Isolating neighborhood      Isolating neighborhood   In the theory of dynamical systems , an isolating neighborhood is a compact set in the phase space of an invertible dynamical system with the property that any orbit contained entirely in the set belongs to its interior . This is a basic notion in the Conley index theory. Its variant for non-invertible systems is used in formulating a precise mathematical definition of an attractor .  Definition  Conley index theory  Let X be the phase space of an invertible discrete or continuous dynamical system with evolution operator        F  t   :    X  →  X   ,   t  ∈   ℤ  ,  ℝ      .     normal-:   subscript  F  t    formulae-sequence   normal-→  X  X     t   ℤ  ℝ       F_{t}:X\to X,\quad t\in\mathbb{Z},\mathbb{R}.     A compact subset N is called an isolating neighborhood if        Inv   (  N  ,  F  )    :=   {   x  ∈  N   :     F  t    (  x  )    ∈    N   for all  t    }   ⊆   Int  N    ,       assign   Inv  N  F    conditional-set    x  N        subscript  F  t   x     N  for all  t           Int  N      \operatorname{Inv}(N,F):=\{x\in N:F_{t}(x)\in N{\ }\text{for all }t\}\subseteq%
 \operatorname{Int}\,N,     where Int N is the interior of N . The set Inv( N , F ) consists of all points whose trajectory remains in N for all positive and negative times. A set S is an isolated (or locally maximal) invariant set if S = Inv( N , F ) for some isolating neighborhood N .  Milnor's definition of attractor  Let      f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f:X\to X     be a (non-invertible) discrete dynamical system. A compact invariant set A is called isolated , with (forward) isolating neighborhood  N if A is the intersection of forward images of N and moreover, A is contained in the interior of N :        A  =    ⋂   n  ≥  0      f  n    (  N  )      ,   A  ⊆   Int  N     .     formulae-sequence    A    subscript     n  0       superscript  f  n   N       A   Int  N      A=\bigcap_{n\geq 0}f^{n}(N),\quad A\subseteq\operatorname{Int}\,N.     It is not assumed that the set N is either invariant or open.  See also   Limit set   References   Konstantin Mischaikow, Marian Mrozek, Conley index .
