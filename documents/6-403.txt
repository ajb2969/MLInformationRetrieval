Acentric factor

The acentric factor 
 
 
 
  is a conceptual number introduced by Kenneth Pitzer in 1955, proven to be very useful in the description of matter.1 It has become a standard for the phase characterization of single & pure components. The other state description parameters are molecular weight, critical temperature, critical pressure, and critical volume.The acentric factor is said to be a measure of the non-sphericity (centricity) of molecules.2
It is defined as:


 
 .
where 
 
 
 
  is the reduced temperature, 
 
 
 
  is the reduced pressure saturation of vapors.
For many monatomic fluids


 
 , is close to 0.1, therefore 
 
 
 
 . In many cases, 
 
 
 
  lies above the boiling temperature of gases at atmosphere pressure.
Values of 
 
 
 
  can be determined for any fluid from 
 
 
 
 , and a vapor measurement from 
 
 
 
 , and for many liquid state matter is tabulated into many thermodynamical tables.
The definition of 
 
 
 
  gives zero-value for the noble gases argon, krypton, and xenon. 
 
 
 
  is almost exactly zero for other spherical molecules.3 Experimental data yields compressibility factors for all fluids that are correlated by the same curves when 
 
 
 
  (compressibility factor) is represented as a function of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This is the basis premises of three-parameter theorem of corresponding states:
All fluids at any 
 
 
 
 -value, in 
 
 
 
  conditions, have about the same 
 
 
 
 -value, and same degree of convergence.
