   Acentric factor      Acentric factor   The acentric factor   ω   ω   \omega   is a conceptual number introduced by Kenneth Pitzer in 1955, proven to be very useful in the description of matter. 1 It has become a standard for the phase characterization of single & pure components. The other state description parameters are molecular weight , critical temperature , critical pressure , and critical volume . The acentric factor is said to be a measure of the non-sphericity (centricity) of molecules. 2  It is defined as:       ω  =    -    log  10    (   p  r  sat   )     -  1    ,     at    T  r    =  0.7      formulae-sequence    ω        subscript   10    subscript   superscript  p  sat   r     1        at   subscript  T  r    0.7     \omega=-\log_{10}(p^{\rm{sat}}_{r})-1,{\rm\ at\ }T_{r}=0.7   .  where     T  r   =   T   T  c         subscript  T  r     T   subscript  T  c      T_{r}=\frac{T}{T_{c}}   is the reduced temperature ,     p  r  sat   =    p  sat    p  c         subscript   superscript  p  sat   r      superscript  p  sat    subscript  p  c      p^{\rm{sat}}_{r}=\frac{p^{\rm{sat}}}{p_{c}}   is the reduced pressure saturation of vapors .  For many monatomic fluids         p  r  sat     at    T  r    =  0.7         superscript   subscript  p  r   sat   at   subscript  T  r    0.7    p_{r}^{\rm{sat}}{\rm\ at\ }T_{r}=0.7   , is close to 0.1, therefore    ω  →  0     normal-→  ω  0    \omega\to 0   . In many cases,     T  r   =  0.7       subscript  T  r   0.7    T_{r}=0.7   lies above the boiling temperature of gases at atmosphere pressure.  Values of   ω   ω   \omega   can be determined for any fluid from    {   T  r   ,   p  r   }      subscript  T  r    subscript  p  r     \{T_{r},p_{r}\}   , and a vapor measurement from     T  r   =  0.7       subscript  T  r   0.7    T_{r}=0.7   , and for many liquid state matter is tabulated into many thermodynamical tables.  The definition of   ω   ω   \omega   gives zero-value for the noble gases  argon , krypton , and xenon .   ω   ω   \omega   is almost exactly zero for other spherical molecules. 3 Experimental data yields compressibility factors for all fluids that are correlated by the same curves when   Z   Z   Z   ( compressibility factor ) is represented as a function of    T  r     subscript  T  r    T_{r}   and    p  r     subscript  p  r    p_{r}   . This is the basis premises of three-parameter theorem of corresponding states :  All fluids at any   ω   ω   \omega   -value, in      {   T  r   ,   p  r   }   =   c  o  n  s  t    .        subscript  T  r    subscript  p  r      c  o  n  s  t     \{T_{r},p_{r}\}=const.   conditions, have about the same   Z   Z   Z   -value, and same degree of convergence.
