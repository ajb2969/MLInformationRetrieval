   Meso-tartrate dehydrogenase      Meso-tartrate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a meso-tartrate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   meso-tartrate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dihydroxyfumarate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are meso- tartaric acid and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are dihydroxyfumarate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is meso-tartrate:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylic acid and dicarboxylic acid metabolism.
