   Flory–Rehner equation      Flory–Rehner equation   In polymer science  Flory–Rehner equation is an equation that describes the mixing of polymer and liquid  molecules as predicted by the equilibrium swelling theory of Flory and Rehner. 1 It describes the equilibrium swelling of a lightly crosslinked polymer in terms of crosslink density and the quality of the solvent . The theory considers forces arising from three sources: 2   The entropy change caused by mixing of polymer and solvent.  The entropy change caused by reduction in numbers of possible chain conformations on swelling.  The heat of mixing of polymer and solvent, which may be positive, negative, or zero.   The equation is written as —       -   [    ln   (   1  -   ν  2    )    +   ν  2   +    χ  1    ν  2  2     ]    =    V  1   n   (    ν  2   1  3    -    ν  2   2    )           delimited-[]        1   subscript  ν  2      subscript  ν  2      subscript  χ  1    superscript   subscript  ν  2   2          subscript  V  1   n     superscript   subscript  ν  2     1  3       subscript  ν  2   2       -\left[\ln{\left(1-\nu_{2}\right)}+\nu_{2}+\chi_{1}\nu_{2}^{2}\right]=V_{1}n%
 \left(\nu_{2}^{\frac{1}{3}}-\frac{\nu_{2}}{2}\right)     where,    ν  2     subscript  ν  2    \nu_{2}   is the volume fraction of polymer in the swollen mass,    V  1     subscript  V  1    V_{1}   the molar volume of the solvent,   n   n   n   is the number of network chain segments bounded on both ends by crosslinks, and    χ  1     subscript  χ  1    \chi_{1}   is the Flory solvent-polymer interaction term. 3  In its full form, the equation is written as 4 —       -   [    ln   (   1  -   ν  2    )    +   ν  2   +    χ  1    ν  2  2     ]    =     V  1     ν  ¯    M  c      (   1  -    2   M  c    M    )    (    ν  2   1  3    -    ν  2   2    )           delimited-[]        1   subscript  ν  2      subscript  ν  2      subscript  χ  1    superscript   subscript  ν  2   2            subscript  V  1      normal-¯  ν    subscript  M  c       1      2   subscript  M  c    M       superscript   subscript  ν  2     1  3       subscript  ν  2   2       -\left[\ln{\left(1-\nu_{2}\right)}+\nu_{2}+\chi_{1}\nu_{2}^{2}\right]=\frac{V_%
