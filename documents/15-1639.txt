   UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine diphosphorylase      UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine diphosphorylase   UDP-N-acetylgalactosamine diphosphorylase () is an enzyme with system name UTP:N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine-1-phosphate uridylyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   UTP + N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    diphosphate + UDP-N-acetyl-alpha-D-galactosamine   The enzyme from plants and animals also acts on N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosamine 1-phosphate.
