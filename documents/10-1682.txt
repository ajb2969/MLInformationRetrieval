   Nocardicin-A epimerase      Nocardicin-A epimerase   In enzymology , a nocardicin-A epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   isonocardicin A   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   nocardicin A   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , isonocardicin A , and one product , nocardicin A .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on amino acids and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nocardicin-A epimerase . This enzyme is also called isonocardicin A epimerase .
