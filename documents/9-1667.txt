Stefan's formula

In thermodynamics, Stefan’s formula says that the specific surface energy at a given interface is determined by the respective enthalpy difference 
 
 
 
 .



where σ is the specific surface energy, NA is Avogadro's number, 
 
 

is a steric dimensionless coefficient, and Vm is the molar volume.
