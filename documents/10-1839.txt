   Formyl-CoA transferase      Formyl-CoA transferase   In enzymology , a formyl-CoA transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   formyl-CoA + oxalate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   formate + oxalyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are formyl-CoA and oxalate , whereas its two products are formate and oxalyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formyl-CoA:oxalate CoA-transferase . Other names in common use include formyl-coenzyme A transferase , and formyl-CoA oxalate CoA-transferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
