   Holtsmark distribution      Holtsmark distribution   The (one-dimensional) Holtsmark distribution is a continuous probability distribution . The Holtsmark distribution is a special case of a stable distribution with the index of stability or shape parameter   α   α   \alpha   equal to 3/2 and skewness parameter   β   β   \beta   of zero. Since   β   β   \beta   equals zero, the distribution is symmetric, and thus an example of a symmetric alpha-stable distribution. The Holtsmark distribution is one of the few examples of a stable distribution for which a closed form expression of the probability density function is known. However, its probability density function is not expressible in terms of elementary functions ; rather, the probability density function is expressed in terms of hypergeometric functions .  The Holtsmark distribution has applications in plasma physics and astrophysics. 1 In 1919, Norwegian physicist J. Holtsmark proposed the distribution as a model for the fluctuating fields in plasma due to chaotic motion of charged particles. 2 It is also applicable to other types of Coulomb forces, in particular to modeling of gravitating bodies, and thus is important in astrophysics. 3 4  Characteristic function  The characteristic function of a symmetric stable distribution is:        φ   (  t  ;  μ  ,  c  )    =   exp   [    i  t   μ    -     |   c  t   |   α     ]     ,        φ   t  μ  c          i  t  μ    superscript      c  t    α       \varphi(t;\mu,c)=\exp\left[~{}it\mu\!-\!|ct|^{\alpha}~{}\right],     where   α   α   \alpha   is the shape parameter, or index of stability,   μ   μ   \mu   is the location parameter , and c is the scale parameter .  Since the Holtsmark distribution has     α  =   3  /  2    ,      α    3  2     \alpha=3/2,   its characteristic function is: 5        φ   (  t  ;  μ  ,  c  )    =   exp   [    i  t   μ    -     |   c  t   |    3  /  2      ]     .        φ   t  μ  c          i  t  μ    superscript      c  t      3  2        \varphi(t;\mu,c)=\exp\left[~{}it\mu\!-\!|ct|^{3/2}~{}\right].     Since the Holtsmark distribution is a stable distribution with ,   μ   μ   \mu   represents the mean of the distribution. 6 7 Since ,   μ   μ   \mu   also represents the median and mode of the distribution. And since , the variance of the Holtsmark distribution is infinite. 8 All higher moments of the distribution are also infinite. 9 Like other stable distributions (other than the normal distribution), since the variance is infinite the dispersion in the distribution is reflected by the scale parameter , c. An alternate approach to describing the dispersion of the distribution is through fractional moments. 10  Probability density function  In general, the probability density function , f ( x ), of a continuous probability distribution can be derived from its characteristic function by:        f   (  x  )    =    1   2  π      ∫   -  ∞   ∞    φ   (  t  )     e   -   i  x  t      d  t      .        f  x       1    2  π      superscript   subscript            φ  t   superscript  e      i  x  t     d  t       f(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\varphi(t)e^{-ixt}\,dt.     Most stable distributions do not have a known closed form expression for their probability density functions. Only the normal , Cauchy and Lévy distributions have known closed form expressions in terms of elementary functions . 11 The Holtsmark distribution is one of two symmetric stable distributions to have a known closed form expression in terms of hypergeometric functions . 12 When   μ   μ   \mu   is equal to 0 and the scale parameter is equal to 1, the Holtsmark distribution has the probability density function:      f   (  x  ;  0  ,  1  )       f   x  0  1     \displaystyle f(x;0,1)     where    Γ   (  x  )       normal-Γ  x    {\Gamma(x)}   is the gamma function and      F  n    m      (  )        subscript   subscript  F  n   m      \;{}_{m}F_{n}()   is a hypergeometric function . 13  References     "  Category:Continuous distributions  Category:Probability distributions with non-finite variance  Category:Power laws  Category:Stable distributions  Category:Probability distributions  Category:Location-scale family probability distributions      ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩       ↩
