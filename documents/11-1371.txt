   Steroid N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase      Steroid N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase   In enzymology , a steroid N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + estradiol-17alpha 3-D-glucuronoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 17alpha-(N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)-estradiol 3-D-glucuronoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and estradiol-17alpha 3-D-glucuronoside , whereas its two products are UDP and 17alpha-(N-acetyl-D-glucosaminyl)-estradiol 3-D-glucuronoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine:estradiol-17alpha-3-D-glucuronoside 17alpha-N-acetylglucosaminyltransferase . Other names in common use include hydroxy steroid acetylglucosaminyltransferase , steroid acetylglucosaminyltransferase , uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine-steroid , and acetylglucosaminyltransferase .
