Ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase

In enzymology, an ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ethanolamine phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  acetaldehyde + NH3 + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ethanolamine phosphate and H2O, whereas its 3 products are acetaldehyde, NH3, and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ethanolamine-phosphate phosphate-lyase (deaminating acetaldehyde-forming). Other names in common use include O-phosphoethanolamine-phospholyase, amino alcohol O-phosphate phospholyase, O-phosphorylethanol-amine phospho-lyase, and ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase (deaminating). It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
