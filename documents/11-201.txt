   Ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase      Ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase   In enzymology , an ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ethanolamine phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetaldehyde + NH 3 + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ethanolamine phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are acetaldehyde , NH 3 , and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ethanolamine-phosphate phosphate-lyase (deaminating acetaldehyde-forming) . Other names in common use include O-phosphoethanolamine-phospholyase , amino alcohol O-phosphate phospholyase , O-phosphorylethanol-amine phospho-lyase , and ethanolamine-phosphate phospho-lyase (deaminating) . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  References      "  Category:EC 4.2.3  Category:Pyridoxal phosphate enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
