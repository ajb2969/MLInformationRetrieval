Tetradecagon

In geometry, a tetradecagon (or tetrakaidecagon) is a polygon with 14 sides and angles.
A regular tetradecagon has Schläfli symbol {14} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated heptagon, t{7}, which alternates two types of edges.

Numismatic use
The regular tetradecagon is used as the shape of some commemorative gold and silver Malaysian coins, the number of sides representing the 14 states of the Malaysian Federation.1
Construction
A regular tetradecagon cannot be constructed using a compass and straightedge.2 However, it is constructible using neusis, or with an angle trisector. The animation below gives an approximation of about 0.05° on the center angle:

Related figures
A tetradecagram is a 14-sided star polygon, represented by symbol {14/n}. There are two regular star polygons: {14/3} and {14/5}, using the same vertices, but connecting every third or fifth points. There are also three compounds: {14/2} is reduced to 2{7} as two heptagons, while {14/4} and {14/6} are reduced to 2{7/2} and 2{7/3} as two different heptagrams, and finally {14/7} is reduced to seven digons.

Deeper truncations of the regular heptagon and heptagrams can produce isogonal (vertex-transitive) intermediate tetradecagram forms with equally spaced vertices and two edge lengths. Other truncations can form double covering polyons 2{p/q}, namely: t{7/6}={14/6}=2{7/3}, t{7/4}={14/4}=2{7/2}, and t{7/2}={14/2}=2{7}.3
