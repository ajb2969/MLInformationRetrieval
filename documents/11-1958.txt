   Laplace operators in differential geometry      Laplace operators in differential geometry   In differential geometry there are a number of second-order, linear, elliptic  differential operators bearing the name Laplacian . This article provides an overview of some of them.  Connection Laplacian  The connection Laplacian , also known as the rough Laplacian , is a differential operator acting on the various tensor bundles of a manifold, defined in terms of a Riemannian - or pseudo-Riemannian metric. When applied to functions (i.e. tensors of rank 0), the connection Laplacian is often called the Laplace–Beltrami operator . It is defined as the trace of the second covariant derivative :        Δ  T   =   -    tr     ∇  2   T      ,        normal-Δ  T       tr    superscript  normal-∇  2   T       \Delta T=-\text{tr}\;\nabla^{2}T,   where T is any tensor,   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   is the Levi-Civita connection associated to the metric, and the trace is taken with respect to the metric. Recall that the second covariant derivative of T is defined as         ∇   X  ,  Y   2   T   =   -   (      ∇  X    ∇  Y    T   -    ∇    ∇  X   Y    T    )     .        subscript   superscript  normal-∇  2    X  Y    T          subscript  normal-∇  X    subscript  normal-∇  Y    T     subscript  normal-∇    subscript  normal-∇  X   Y    T       \nabla^{2}_{X,Y}T=-\left(\nabla_{X}\nabla_{Y}T-\nabla_{\nabla_{X}Y}T\right).     Note that with this definition, the connection Laplacian has negative spectrum . On functions, it agrees with the operator given as the divergence of the gradient.  If connection of interest is Levi-Civita connection one can find a convenient formula for Laplacian of scalar function in terms of partial derivatives with respect to chosen coordinates:       Δ  ϕ   =     |  g  |    -   1  /  2        ∂  μ    (     |  g  |    1  /  2     g   μ  ν     ∂  ν    )    ϕ          normal-Δ  ϕ      superscript    g       1  2        subscript   μ      superscript    g     1  2     superscript  g    μ  ν     subscript   ν     ϕ      \Delta\phi=|g|^{-1/2}\partial_{\mu}\left(|g|^{1/2}g^{\mu\nu}\partial_{\nu}%
 \right)\phi     where   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is scalar function,    |  g  |      g    |g|   is absolute value of determinant of metric (the use of absolute value is necessary in Pseudo Riemmanian case , for example in General Relativity ) and    g   μ  ν      superscript  g    μ  ν     g^{\mu\nu}   denotes inverse of the metric tensor  Hodge Laplacian  The Hodge Laplacian , also known as the Laplace–de Rham operator , is a differential operator acting on differential forms . (Abstractly, it is a second order operator on each exterior power of the cotangent bundle .) This operator is defined on any manifold equipped with a Riemannian - or pseudo-Riemannian metric.       Δ  =    d  δ   +   δ  d    =    (   d  +  δ   )   2    ,        normal-Δ      normal-d  δ     δ  normal-d          superscript    normal-d  δ   2      \Delta=\mathrm{d}\delta+\delta\mathrm{d}=(\mathrm{d}+\delta)^{2},\;     where d is the exterior derivative or differential and δ is the codifferential . The Hodge Laplacian on a compact manifold has nonnegative spectrum .  The connection Laplacian may also be taken to act on differential forms by restricting it to act on skew-symmetric tensors. The connection Laplacian differs from the Hodge Laplacian by means of a Weitzenböck identity .  Bochner Laplacian  The Bochner Laplacian is defined differently from the connection Laplacian, but the two will turn out to differ only by a sign, whenever the former is defined. Let M be a compact, oriented manifold equipped with a metric. Let E be a vector bundle over M equipped with a fiber metric and a compatible connection,   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   . This connection gives rise to a differential operator        ∇  :    Γ   (  E  )    →   Γ   (     T  *   M   ⊗  E   )        normal-:  normal-∇   normal-→    normal-Γ  E     normal-Γ   tensor-product     superscript  T    M   E       \nabla:\Gamma(E)\rightarrow\Gamma(T^{*}M\otimes E)        where    Γ   (  E  )       normal-Γ  E    \Gamma(E)   denotes smooth sections of E , and T * M is the cotangent bundle of M . It is possible to take the    L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   -adjoint of   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   , giving a differential operator          ∇  *   :    Γ   (     T  *   M   ⊗  E   )    →   Γ   (  E  )      .     normal-:   superscript  normal-∇     normal-→    normal-Γ   tensor-product     superscript  T    M   E      normal-Γ  E      \nabla^{*}:\Gamma(T^{*}M\otimes E)\rightarrow\Gamma(E).        The Bochner Laplacian is given by        Δ  =    ∇  *   ∇       normal-Δ    superscript  normal-∇    normal-∇     \Delta=\nabla^{*}\nabla        which is a second order operator acting on sections of the vector bundle E . Note that the connection Laplacian and Bochner Laplacian differ only by a sign:          ∇  *   ∇   =   -    tr    ∇  2           superscript  normal-∇    normal-∇       tr   superscript  normal-∇  2       \nabla^{*}\nabla=-\text{tr}\,\nabla^{2}        Lichnerowicz Laplacian  The Lichnerowicz Laplacian 1 is defined on symmetric tensors by taking    ∇  :    Γ   (    Sym  k    (   T  M   )    )    →   Γ   (    Sym   k  +  1     (   T  M   )    )        normal-:  normal-∇   normal-→    normal-Γ    superscript  Sym  k     T  M       normal-Γ    superscript  Sym    k  1      T  M        \nabla:\Gamma(\operatorname{Sym}^{k}(TM))\to\Gamma(\operatorname{Sym}^{k+1}(TM))   to be the symmetrized covariant derivative. The Lichnerowicz Laplacian is then defined by     Δ  L   =    ∇  *   ∇        subscript  normal-Δ  L     superscript  normal-∇    normal-∇     \Delta_{L}=\nabla^{*}\nabla   , where    ∇  *     superscript  normal-∇     \nabla^{*}   is the formal adjoint. The Lichnerowicz Laplacian differs from the usual tensor Laplacian by a Weitzenbock formula involving the Riemann curvature tensor , and has natural applications in the study of Ricci flow and the prescribed Ricci curvature problem .  Conformal Laplacian  On a Riemannian manifold , one can define the conformal Laplacian as an operator on smooth functions; it differs from the Laplace–Beltrami operator by a term involving the scalar curvature of the underlying metric. In dimension n ≥ 3, the conformal Laplacian, denoted L , acts on a smooth function u by        L  u   =    -   4    n  -  1    n  -  2    Δ  u    +   R  u     ,        L  u         4      n  1     n  2    normal-Δ  u      R  u      Lu=-4\frac{n-1}{n-2}\Delta u+Ru,     where Δ is the Laplace-Beltrami operator (of negative spectrum), and R is the scalar curvature. This operator often makes an appearance when studying how the scalar curvature behaves under a conformal change of a Riemannian metric. If n ≥ 3 and g is a metric and u is a smooth, positive function, then the conformal metric       g  ~   =    u   4  /   (   n  -  2   )      g         normal-~  g      superscript  u    4    n  2     g     \tilde{g}=u^{4/(n-2)}g\,     has scalar curvature given by        R  ~   =    u   -    (   n  +  2   )   /   (   n  -  2   )      L  u    .       normal-~  R      superscript  u        n  2     n  2      L  u     \tilde{R}=u^{-(n+2)/(n-2)}Lu.\,     See also   Weitzenböck identity   References    "  Category:Differential operators  Category:Differential geometry     ↩
