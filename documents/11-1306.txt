Lipid-A-disaccharide synthase

In enzymology, a lipid-A-disaccharide synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)glucosamine + 2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-beta-D-glucosaminyl 1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  UDP + 2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-D-glucosaminyl-1,6-beta-D-2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-beta-D-glucosaminyl 1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)glucosamine and 2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-beta-D-glucosaminyl 1-phosphate, whereas its 2 products are UDP and 2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-D-glucosaminyl-1,6-beta-D-2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-beta-D-glucosaminyl 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)glucosamine:2,3-bis-(3-hydroxytet radecanoyl)-beta-D-glucosaminyl-1-phosphate 2,3-bis(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-glucosaminyltransferase. This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis.
