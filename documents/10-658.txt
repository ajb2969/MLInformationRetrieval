   3alpha-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate dehydrogenase      3alpha-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 3alpha-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3alpha-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-oxoglycyrrhetinate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3alpha-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 3-oxoglycyrrhetinate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3alpha-hydroxyglycyrrhetinate:NADP + 3-oxidoreductase .
