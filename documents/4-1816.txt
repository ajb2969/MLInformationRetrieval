   Whitney immersion theorem      Whitney immersion theorem   In differential topology , the Whitney immersion theorem states that for    m  >  1      m  1    m>1   , any smooth   m   m   m   -dimensional manifold (required also to be Hausdorff and second-countable ) has a one-to-one immersion in Euclidean     2  m      2  m    2m   -space, and a (not necessarily one-to-one) immersion in    (    2  m   -  1   )        2  m   1    (2m-1)   -space. Similarly, every smooth   m   m   m   -dimensional manifold can be immersed in the     2  m   -  1        2  m   1    2m-1   -dimensional sphere (this removes the    m  >  1      m  1    m>1   constraint).  The weak version, for     2  m   +  1        2  m   1    2m+1   , is due to transversality ( general position , dimension counting ): two m -dimensional manifolds in    ùêë   2  m      superscript  ùêë    2  m     \mathbf{R}^{2m}   intersect generically in a 0-dimensional space.  Further Results  Massey went on to prove that every n-dimensional manifold is cobordant to a manifold that immerses in    S    2  n   -   a   (  n  )        superscript  S      2  n     a  n      S^{2n-a(n)}   where    a   (  n  )       a  n    a(n)   is the number of 1's that appear in the binary expansion of   n   n   n   . In the same paper, Massey proved that for every n there is manifold (which happens to be a product of real projective spaces) that does not immerse in    S    2  n   -  1  -   a   (  n  )        superscript  S      2  n   1    a  n      S^{2n-1-a(n)}   . The conjecture that every n-manifold immerses in    S    2  n   -   a   (  n  )        superscript  S      2  n     a  n      S^{2n-a(n)}   became known as the Immersion Conjecture which was eventually solved in the affirmative by Ralph Cohen .
