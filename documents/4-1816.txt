Whitney immersion theorem




Whitney immersion theorem

In differential topology, the Whitney immersion theorem states that for 
 
 
 
 , any smooth 
 
 
 
 -dimensional manifold (required also to be Hausdorff and second-countable) has a one-to-one immersion in Euclidean

 
 -space, and a (not necessarily one-to-one) immersion in 
 
 
 
 -space. Similarly, every smooth 
 
 
 
 -dimensional manifold can be immersed in the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional sphere (this removes the 
 
 
 
  constraint).
The weak version, for 
 
 
 
 , is due to transversality (general position, dimension counting): two m-dimensional manifolds in 
 
 
 
  intersect generically in a 0-dimensional space.
Further Results
Massey went on to prove that every n-dimensional manifold is cobordant to a manifold that immerses in 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of 1's that appear in the binary expansion of 
 
 
 
 . In the same paper, Massey proved that for every n there is manifold (which happens to be a product of real projective spaces) that does not immerse in 
 
 
 
 . The conjecture that every n-manifold immerses in 
 
 
 
  became known as the Immersion Conjecture which was eventually solved in the affirmative by Ralph Cohen .
