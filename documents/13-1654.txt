   Mudrock line      Mudrock line   In rock physics and petrophysics , the mudrock line , also called Castagna's equation or Castagna's relation , is an empirical linear relation between seismic  P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity in brine -saturated siliciclastic rocks (i.e. sandstones and shales ).  The equation reads:       V  p   =    1.16   V  s    +  1.36        subscript  V  p       1.16   subscript  V  s    1.36     V_{p}=1.16V_{s}+1.36     Where    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   and    V  s     subscript  V  s    V_{s}   refer to P-wave velocity and S-wave velocity, respectively. 1 Velocities are given in kilometers per second (km/s).  The name of the equation refers to John Castagna , professor of exploration geophysics at the University of Houston , 2 who discovered the relation while working for ARCO , an oil company that is now a subsidiary of BP .
