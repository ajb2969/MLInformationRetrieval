   Fuzzy sphere      Fuzzy sphere   In mathematics , the fuzzy sphere is one of the simplest and most canonical examples of non-commutative geometry . Ordinarily, the functions defined on a sphere form a commuting algebra. A fuzzy sphere differs from an ordinary sphere because the algebra of functions on it is not commutative. It is generated by spherical harmonics whose spin l is at most equal to some j . The terms in the product of two spherical harmonics that involve spherical harmonics with spin exceeding j are simply omitted in the product. This truncation replaces an infinite-dimensional commutative algebra by a    j  2     superscript  j  2    j^{2}   -dimensional non-commutative algebra.  The simplest way to see this sphere is to realize this truncated algebra of functions as a matrix algebra on some finite-dimensional vector space. Take the three j -dimensional matrices       J  a   ,  a   =  1   ,   2  ,  3      formulae-sequence      subscript  J  a   a   1    2  3     J_{a},~{}a=1,2,3   that form a basis for the j dimensional irreducible representation of the Lie algebra SU(2) . They satisfy the relations     [   J  a   ,   J  b   ]   =   i   ϵ   a  b  c     J  c          subscript  J  a    subscript  J  b      i   subscript  ϵ    a  b  c     subscript  J  c      [J_{a},J_{b}]=i\epsilon_{abc}J_{c}   , where    ϵ   a  b  c      subscript  ϵ    a  b  c     \epsilon_{abc}   is the totally antisymmetric symbol with     ϵ  123   =  1       subscript  ϵ  123   1    \epsilon_{123}=1   , and generate via the matrix product the algebra    M  j     subscript  M  j    M_{j}   of j dimensional matrices. The value of the SU(2)  Casimir operator in this representation is        J  1  2   +   J  2  2   +   J  3  2    =    1  4    (    j  2   -  1   )   I          superscript   subscript  J  1   2    superscript   subscript  J  2   2    superscript   subscript  J  3   2        1  4      superscript  j  2   1   I     J_{1}^{2}+J_{2}^{2}+J_{3}^{2}=\frac{1}{4}(j^{2}-1)I     where I is the j -dimensional identity matrix. Thus, if we define the 'coordinates'     x  a   =   k   r   -  1     J  a         subscript  x  a     k   superscript  r    1     subscript  J  a      x_{a}=kr^{-1}J_{a}   where r is the radius of the sphere and k is a parameter, related to r and j by     4   r  4    =    k  2    (    j  2   -  1   )          4   superscript  r  4       superscript  k  2      superscript  j  2   1      4r^{4}=k^{2}(j^{2}-1)   , then the above equation concerning the Casimir operator can be rewritten as        x  1  2   +   x  2  2   +   x  3  2    =   r  2          superscript   subscript  x  1   2    superscript   subscript  x  2   2    superscript   subscript  x  3   2     superscript  r  2     x_{1}^{2}+x_{2}^{2}+x_{3}^{2}=r^{2}   ,  which is the usual relation for the coordinates on a sphere of radius r embedded in three dimensional space.  One can define an integral on this space, by        ∫   S  2     f  d  Ω    :=   2  π   k   Tr   (  F  )       assign    subscript    superscript  S  2      f  d  normal-Ω      2  π  k  Tr  F     \int_{S^{2}}fd\Omega:=2\pi k\,\text{Tr}(F)     where F is the matrix corresponding to the function f . For example, the integral of unity, which gives the surface of the sphere in the commutative case is here equal to       2  π   k   Tr   (  I  )    =   2  π  k  j   =   4  π   r  2    j     j  2   -  1              2  π  k  Tr  I     2  π  k  j          4  π   superscript  r  2     j       superscript  j  2   1         2\pi k\,\text{Tr}(I)=2\pi kj=4\pi r^{2}\frac{j}{\sqrt{j^{2}-1}}     which converges to the value of the surface of the sphere if one takes j to infinity.
