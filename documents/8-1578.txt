   Root mean square fluctuation      Root mean square fluctuation   The mean square fluctuation ( MSF ) is a measure of the deviation between the position of particle i and some reference position.       M  S  F   =     1  T     ∑    t  j   =  1   T     (     x  i    (   t  j   )    -    x  ~   i    )   2            M  S  F         1  T     superscript   subscript      subscript  t  j   1    T    superscript       subscript  x  i    subscript  t  j     subscript   normal-~  x   i    2        MSF=\sqrt{\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t_{j}=1}^{T}(x_{i}(t_{j})-\tilde{x}_{i})^{2}}   ,  where T is the time over which one wants to average, and     x  ~   i     subscript   normal-~  x   i    \tilde{x}_{i}   is the reference position of particle i. Typically this reference position will be the time-averaged position of the same particle i, i.e.     x  ¯   i     subscript   normal-¯  x   i    \overline{x}_{i}     Note that the difference between RMSD and RMSF is that with the latter the average is taken over time, giving a value for each particle i. With RMSD the average is taken over the particles, giving time resolved values.
