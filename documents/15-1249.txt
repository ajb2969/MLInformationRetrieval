16S rRNA (adenine1408-N1)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (adenine1408-N1)-methyltransferase (, kanamycin-apramycin resistance methylase, 16S rRNA:m1A1408 methyltransferase, KamB, NpmA, 16S rRNA m1A1408 methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (adenine1408-N1)-methyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine1408 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methyladenine1408 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme provides a panaminoglycoside resistance through interference with the binding of aminoglycosides.
