   16S rRNA (adenine1408-N1)-methyltransferase      16S rRNA (adenine1408-N1)-methyltransferase   16S rRNA (adenine 1408 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, kanamycin-apramycin resistance methylase , 16S rRNA:m1A1408 methyltransferase , KamB , NpmA , 16S rRNA m1A1408 methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (adenine 1408 -N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenine 1408 in 16S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 - methyladenine 1408 in 16S rRNA   The enzyme provides a panaminoglycoside resistance through interference with the binding of aminoglycosides .
