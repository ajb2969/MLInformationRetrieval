Test vector

In computer science and engineering, a test vector is a set of inputs provided to a system in order to test that system.
Rationale
In computer science and engineering, a system acts as a computable function. An example of a specific function could be 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the output of the system and 
 
 
 
  is the input; however, most systems' inputs are not one-dimensional. When the inputs are multi-dimensional, we could say that the system takes the form 
 
 
 
  ; however, we can generalize this equation to a general form 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the result of the system's execution, 
 
 
 
  belongs to the set of computable functions, and 
 
 
 
  is an input vector. While testing the system, various test vectors must be used to examine the system's behavior with differing inputs.
Example
For an example, consider a login page with two input fields: a username field and a password field. In that case, the login system can be described as:



with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  designating login successful, and 
 
 
 
  designating login failure, respectively.
Making things more generic, we can suggest that the function 
 
 
 
  takes input as a 2-dimensional vector and outputs a one-dimensional vector (scalar). This can be written in the following way:-



with 
 
 

In this case, 
 
 
 
  is called the input vector, and 
 
 
 
  is called the output vector.
In order to test the login page, it is necessary to pass some sample input vectors 
 
 
 
 . In this context 
 
 
 
  is called a test vector.
