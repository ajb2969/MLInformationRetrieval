   Test vector      Test vector   In computer science and engineering , a test vector is a set of inputs provided to a system in order to test that system.  Rationale  In computer science and engineering, a system acts as a computable function . An example of a specific function could be    y  =   f   (  x  )        y    f  x     y=f(x)   where   y   y   y   is the output of the system and   x   x   x   is the input; however, most systems' inputs are not one-dimensional. When the inputs are multi-dimensional, we could say that the system takes the form    y  =   f   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  )        y    f    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…      y=f(x_{1},x_{2},...)   ; however, we can generalize this equation to a general form    Y  =   C   (  X  )        Y    C  X     Y=C(X)   where   Y   Y   Y   is the result of the system's execution,   C   C   C   belongs to the set of computable functions , and   X   X   X   is an input vector. While testing the system, various test vectors must be used to examine the system's behavior with differing inputs.  Example  For an example, consider a login page with two input fields: a username field and a password field. In that case, the login system can be described as:      y  =   L   (  u  ,  p  )        y    L   u  p      y=L(u,p)     with    y  ∈   {   t  r  u  e   ,   f  a  l  s  e   }       y     t  r  u  e     f  a  l  s  e      y\in\{true,false\}   and     u  ,  p   ∈   {   S  t  r  i  n  g   }        u  p      S  t  r  i  n  g      u,p\in\{String\}   , with    t  r  u  e      t  r  u  e    true   designating login successful, and    f  a  l  s  e      f  a  l  s  e    false   designating login failure, respectively.  Making things more generic, we can suggest that the function   L   L   L   takes input as a 2-dimensional vector and outputs a one-dimensional vector ( scalar ). This can be written in the following way:-      Y  =   L   (  X  )        Y    L  X     Y=L(X)     with     X  =   [   x  1   ,   x  2   ]   =   [  u  ,  p  ]    ;   Y  =   [   y  1   ]       formulae-sequence      X    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2          u  p       Y   delimited-[]   subscript  y  1       X=[x_{1},x_{2}]=[u,p]\;;\;Y=[y_{1}]     In this case,   X   X   X   is called the input vector, and   Y   Y   Y   is called the output vector.  In order to test the login page, it is necessary to pass some sample input vectors    {   X  1   ,   X  2   ,   X  3   ,  …  }      subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2    subscript  X  3   normal-…    \{X_{1},X_{2},X_{3},...\}   . In this context    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   is called a test vector.
