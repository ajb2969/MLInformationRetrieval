In statistics, Knockoff Filter1 is a feature selection (variable selection) procedure proposed by Rina Foygel Barber and Emmanuel Candès which control the False Discovery Rate for a linear regression model in classical setting (When there is at least many observations as variables ).
Method Set Up
For linear regression model:


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the response, 
 
 
 
  is the design matrix. We have an unknown coefficients vector 
 
 
 
  as well as Gaussian noise 
 
 
 
 .
The False Discovery Rate in linear regression is defined as follow:
If there is a variable selection method gives you a indices set 
 
 
 
 , then


 
 ,
where the notation 
 
 
 
 . The FDR is said to be controlled at level 
 
 
 
  means that FDR 
 
 
 
  for all coefficient 
 
 
 
 .
To set up "Knockoff Filter", first normalize the design matrix

 
 , and calculate the Gram matrix

 
 . Then construct a knock off 
 
 
 
  for each column of design matrix

 
  such that


 
  and 
 
 

where 
 
 
 
  is a nonnegative vector. Thus 
 
 
 
  exhibits the same covariance structure as the original design matrix

 
  and also


 
  for all 
 
 


Then Construct the augmented matrix

 
 . Use the LASSO model



to this augmented matrix to select the feature. Define statistics 
 
 
 
 . Then the Lasso model gives a 
 
 
 
 -dimension statistics 
 
 
 
 .
Define the statistics 
 
 
 
  for each variable:



then define a threshold



The select the model 
 
 
 
  as



Advantages of Knockoff
It is proved by Rina Foygel Barber and Emmanuel Candès that for any 
 
 
 
 , the knockoff method defined above satisfies:



Which means that the False Discovery Rate is well controlled.
