   Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator      Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator   In mathematics , the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator is a generalization of the Laplace operator to an infinite-dimensional setting. The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator plays a significant role in the Malliavin calculus .  Introduction: the finite-dimensional picture  The Laplacian  Consider the gradient operator ∇ acting on scalar functions f : R n → R ; the gradient of a scalar function is a vector field  v = ∇ f : R n → R n . The divergence operator div, acting on vector fields to produce scalar fields, is the adjoint operator to ∇. The Laplace operator Δ is then the composition of the divergence and gradient operators:      Δ  =   div  ∘  ∇       normal-Δ    div  normal-∇     \Delta=\mathrm{div}\circ\nabla   ,  acting on scalar functions to produce scalar functions. Note that A = −Δ is a positive operator, whereas Δ is a dissipative operator .  Using spectral theory , one can define a square root (1 − Δ) 1/2 for the operator (1 − Δ). This square root satisfies the following relation involving the Sobolev H 1 -norm and L 2 -norm for suitable scalar functions f :         ∥  f  ∥    H  1   2   =    ∥     (   1  -  Δ   )    1  /  2    f   ∥    L  2   2    .       superscript   subscript   norm  f    superscript  H  1    2    superscript   subscript   norm     superscript    1  normal-Δ     1  2    f     superscript  L  2    2     \big\|f\big\|_{H^{1}}^{2}=\big\|(1-\Delta)^{1/2}f\big\|_{L^{2}}^{2}.     The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator  Often, when working on R n , one works with respect to Lebesgue measure , which has many nice properties. However, remember that the aim is to work in infinite -dimensional spaces, and it is a fact that there is no infinite-dimensional Lebesgue measure . Instead, if one is studying some separable  Banach space  E , what does make sense is a notion of Gaussian measure ; in particular, the abstract Wiener space construction makes sense.  To get some intuition about what can be expected in the infinite-dimensional setting, consider standard Gaussian measure γ n on R n : for Borel subsets A of R n ,         γ  n    (  A  )    :=    ∫  A      (   2  π   )    -   n  /  2      exp   (   -     |  x  |   2   /  2    )    d  x     .     assign     superscript  γ  n   A     subscript   A      superscript    2  π       n  2            superscript    x   2   2     normal-d  x      \gamma^{n}(A):=\int_{A}(2\pi)^{-n/2}\exp(-|x|^{2}/2)\,\mathrm{d}x.     This makes ( R n , B ( R n ), γ n ) into a probability space ; E will denote expectation with respect to γ n .  The gradient operator ∇ acts on a (differentiable) function φ : R n → R to give a vector field ∇ φ : R n → R n .  The divergence operator  δ (to be more precise, δ n , since it depends on the dimension) is now defined to be the adjoint of ∇ in the Hilbert space sense, in the Hilbert space L 2 ( R n , B ( R n ), γ n ; R ). In other words, δ acts on a vector field v : R n → R n to give a scalar function δv : R n → R , and satisfies the formula        𝔼   [   ∇   f  ⋅  v    ]    =   𝔼   [   f  δ  v   ]     .        𝔼   delimited-[]   normal-∇   normal-⋅  f  v        𝔼   delimited-[]    f  δ  v       \mathbb{E}\big[\nabla f\cdot v\big]=\mathbb{E}\big[f\delta v\big].     On the left, the product is the pointwise Euclidean dot product of two vector fields; on the right, it is just the pointwise multiplication of two functions. Using integration by parts , one can check that δ acts on a vector field v with components v i , i = 1, ..., n , as follows:        δ  v   (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n    (     x  i    v  i    (  x  )    -     ∂   v  i     ∂   x  i      (  x  )     )     .        δ  v  x     superscript   subscript     i  1    n        subscript  x  i    superscript  v  i   x          superscript  v  i       subscript  x  i     x       \delta v(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left(x_{i}v^{i}(x)-\frac{\partial v^{i}}{\partial x%
 _{i}}(x)\right).     The change of notation from “div” to “ δ ” is for two reasons: first, δ is the notation used in infinite dimensions (the Malliavin calculus); secondly, δ is really the negative of the usual divergence.  The (finite-dimensional) Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator  L (or, to be more precise, L m ) is defined by       L  :=   -   δ  ∘  ∇     ,     assign  L      δ  normal-∇      L:=-\delta\circ\nabla,     with the useful formula that for any f and g smooth enough for all the terms to make sense,        δ   (   f   ∇  g    )    =    -    ∇  f   ⋅   ∇  g     -   f  L  g     .        δ    f   normal-∇  g          normal-⋅   normal-∇  f    normal-∇  g       f  L  g      \delta(f\nabla g)=-\nabla f\cdot\nabla g-fLg.     The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator L is related to the usual Laplacian Δ by        L  f   (  x  )    =    Δ  f   (  x  )    -    x  ⋅   ∇  f     (  x  )      .        L  f  x       normal-Δ  f  x      normal-⋅  x   normal-∇  f    x      Lf(x)=\Delta f(x)-x\cdot\nabla f(x).     The Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator for a separable Banach space  Consider now an abstract Wiener space  E with Cameron-Martin Hilbert space H and Wiener measure γ . Let D denote the Malliavin derivative . The Malliavin derivative D is an unbounded operator from L 2 ( E , γ ; R ) into L 2 ( E , γ ; H ) – in some sense, it measures “how random” a function on E is. The domain of D is not the whole of L 2 ( E , γ ; R ), but is a dense  linear subspace , the Watanabe-Sobolev space, often denoted by    𝔻   1  ,  2      superscript  𝔻   1  2     \mathbb{D}^{1,2}   (once differentiable in the sense of Malliavin, with derivative in L 2 ).  Again, δ is defined to be the adjoint of the gradient operator (in this case, the Malliavin derivative is playing the role of the gradient operator). The operator δ is also known the Skorokhod integral , which is an anticipating stochastic integral ; it is this set-up that gives rise to the slogan “stochastic integrals are divergences”. δ satisfies the identity       𝔼   [    ⟨   D  F   ,  v  ⟩   H   ]    =   𝔼   [   F  δ  v   ]          𝔼   delimited-[]   subscript     normal-D  F   v   H       𝔼   delimited-[]    F  δ  v       \mathbb{E}\big[\langle\mathrm{D}F,v\rangle_{H}\big]=\mathbb{E}\big[F\delta v\big]     for all F in    𝔻   1  ,  2      superscript  𝔻   1  2     \mathbb{D}^{1,2}   and v in the domain of δ .  Then the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck operator for E is the operator L defined by       L  :=   -   δ  ∘  D     .     assign  L      δ  normal-D      L:=-\delta\circ\mathrm{D}.
