Event structure

In mathematics and computer science, an event structure represents a set of events, some of which can only be performed after another (there is a dependency between the events) and some of which might not be performed together (there is a conflict between the events).
Formal definition
An event structure

 
  consists of

a set 
 
 
 
  of events
a partial order relation on 
 
 
 
  called causal dependency,
an irreflexive symmetric relation 
 
 
 
  called incompatibility (or conflict)

such that

finite causes: for every event 
 
 
 
 , the set 
 
 
 
  of predecessors of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is finite
hereditary conflict: for every events 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 .
