   Event structure      Event structure   In mathematics and computer science , an event structure represents a set of events, some of which can only be performed after another (there is a dependency between the events) and some of which might not be performed together (there is a conflict between the events).  Formal definition  An event structure     (  E  ,  ≤  ,  #  )     E   normal-#    (E,\leq,\#)   consists of   a set   E   E   E   of events  a partial order relation on   E   E   E   called causal dependency ,  an irreflexive  symmetric relation   #   normal-#   \#   called incompatibility (or conflict )   such that   finite causes : for every event    e  ∈  E      e  E    e\in E   , the set     [  e  ]   =   {   f  ∈  E   |   f  ≤  e   }        delimited-[]  e    conditional-set    f  E     f  e      [e]=\{f\in E|f\leq e\}   of predecessors of   e   e   e   in   E   E   E   is finite  hereditary conflict : for every events     d  ,  e  ,  f   ∈  E       d  e  f   E    d,e,f\in E   , if    d  ≤  e      d  e    d\leq e   and    d  #  f      d  normal-#  f    d\#f   then    e  #  f      e  normal-#  f    e\#f   .
