   Pohlmeyer charge      Pohlmeyer charge   In theoretical physics  Pohlmeyer charge , named for Klaus Pohlmeyer , is a conserved charge invariant under the Virasoro algebra or its generalization. It can be obtained by expanding the holonomies (generating functions)       P   T   r    exp   i   T  μ      ∮   d  σ   A  σ   (  μ  )     (  σ  )         P  T  r      i   subscript  T  μ      contour-integral    d  σ   superscript   subscript  A  σ   μ   σ      P\,Tr\,\exp iT_{\mu}\oint d\sigma A_{\sigma}^{(\mu)}(\sigma)     with respect to the constant matrices T . The gauge field    A  σ  μ     superscript   subscript  A  σ   μ    A_{\sigma}^{\mu}   is defined as a combination of    ∂   X  μ        superscript  X  μ     \partial X^{\mu}   and its conjugate.  According to the logic of loop quantum gravity and algebraic quantum field theory , these charges are the right physical quantities that should be used for quantization. This logic is however incompatible with the standard and well-established methods of quantum field theory based on Fock space and perturbation theory .  "  Category:Theoretical physics
