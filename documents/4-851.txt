   Centered triangular number      Centered triangular number   A centered (or centred ) triangular number is a centered  figurate number that represents a triangle with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center in successive triangular layers. The centered triangular number for n is given by the formula         3   n  2    +   3  n   +  2   2   .          3   superscript  n  2      3  n   2   2    {{3n^{2}+3n+2}\over 2}.     The following image shows the building of the centered triangular numbers using the associated figures: at each step the previous figure, shown in red, is surrounded by a triangle of new points, in blue.  (Figure)  construction   The first few centered triangular numbers are:   1 , 4 , 10 , 19 , 31 , 46 , 64 , 85 , 109 , 136 , 166, 199, 235, 274, 316, 361, 409, 460, 514, 571, 631, 694, 760, 829, 901, 976, 1054, 1135, 1219, 1306, 1396, 1489, 1585, 1684, 1786, 1891, 1999, 2110, 2224, 2341, 2461, 2584, 2710, 2839, 2971, … .   Each centered triangular number from 10 onwards is the sum of three consecutive regular triangular numbers . Also each centered triangular number has a remainder of 1 when divided by three and the quotient (if positive) is the previous regular triangular number.  The sum of the first n centered triangular numbers is the magic constant for an n by n normal magic square for n > 2.  Centered triangular prime  A centered triangular prime is a centered triangular number that is prime . The first few centered triangular primes are   19, 31, 109, 199, 409, … .
