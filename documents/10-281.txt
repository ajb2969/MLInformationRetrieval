Bending stiffness

The bending stiffness (
 
 
 
 ) is the resistance of a member against bending deformation. It is a function of elastic modulus

 
 , the area moment of inertia

 
  of the beam cross-section about the axis of interest, length of the beam and beam boundary condition. Bending stiffness of a beam can analytically be derived from the equation of beam deflection when it is applied by a force.



where 
 
 
 
  is the applied force and 
 
 
 
  is the deflection. According to elementary beam theory, the relationship between the applied bending moment 
 
 
 
  and the resulting curvature

 
  of the beam is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the deflection of the beam and 
 
 
 
  is the distance along the beam. Double integration of the above equation leads to computing the deflection of the beam, and in turn, the bending stiffness of the beam. Bending stiffness in beams is also known as Flexural rigidity.
