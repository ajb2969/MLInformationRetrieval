   Rudin–Shapiro sequence      Rudin–Shapiro sequence   In mathematics the Rudin–Shapiro sequence , also known as the Golay–Rudin–Shapiro sequence is an infinite automatic sequence named after Marcel Golay , Walter Rudin and Harold S. Shapiro , who independently investigated its properties. 1  Definition  Each term of the Rudin–Shapiro sequence is either +1 or −1. The n th term of the sequence, b n , is defined by the rules:       a  n   =    ∑    ε  i    ε   i  +  1            subscript  a  n        subscript  ε  i    subscript  ε    i  1        a_{n}=\textstyle\sum\varepsilon_{i}\varepsilon_{i+1}          b  n   =    (   -  1   )    a  n         subscript  b  n    superscript    1    subscript  a  n      b_{n}=(-1)^{a_{n}}     where the ε i are the digits in the binary expansion of n . Thus a n counts the number of (possibly overlapping) occurrences of the sub-string 11 in the binary expansion of n , and b n is +1 if a n is even and −1 if a n is odd. 2 3 4  For example, a 6 = 1 and b 6 = −1 because the binary representation of 6 is 110, which contains one occurrence of 11; whereas a 7 = 2 and b 7 = +1 because the binary representation of 7 is 111, which contains two (overlapping) occurrences of 11.  Starting at n = 0, the first few terms of the a n sequence are:   0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 2, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 3, ...   and the corresponding terms b n of the Rudin–Shapiro sequence are:   +1, +1, +1, −1, +1, +1, −1, +1, +1, +1, +1, −1, −1, −1, +1, −1, ...   Properties  The Rudin–Shapiro sequence can be generated by a four state automaton . 5  There is a recursive definition 6      {      b   2  n        =   b  n         b    2  n   +  1        =     (   -  1   )   n    b  n           cases   subscript  b    2  n      absent   subscript  b  n     subscript  b      2  n   1      absent     superscript    1   n    subscript  b  n       \begin{cases}b_{2n}&=b_{n}\\
 b_{2n+1}&=(-1)^{n}b_{n}\end{cases}     The values of the terms a n and b n in the Rudin–Shapiro sequence can be found recursively as follows. If n = m .2 k where m is odd then       a  n   =   {      a    (   m  -  1   )   /  4        if  m   =   1  mod  4          a    (   m  -  1   )   /  2    +  1       if  m   =   3  mod  4             subscript  a  n    cases   subscript  a      m  1   4        if  m    modulo  1  4       subscript  a      m  1   2    1       if  m    modulo  3  4       a_{n}=\begin{cases}a_{(m-1)/4}&\text{if }m=1\mod 4\\
 a_{(m-1)/2}+1&\text{if }m=3\mod 4\end{cases}          b  n   =   {      b    (   m  -  1   )   /  4        if  m   =   1  mod  4         -   b    (   m  -  1   )   /  2         if  m   =   3  mod  4             subscript  b  n    cases   subscript  b      m  1   4        if  m    modulo  1  4       subscript  b      m  1   2         if  m    modulo  3  4       b_{n}=\begin{cases}b_{(m-1)/4}&\text{if }m=1\mod 4\\
 -b_{(m-1)/2}&\text{if }m=3\mod 4\end{cases}     Thus a 108 = a 13 + 1 = a 3 + 1 = a 1 + 2 = a 0 + 2 = 2, which can be verified by observing that the binary representation of 108, which is 1101100, contains two sub-strings 11. And so b 108 = (−1) 2 = +1.  The Rudin-Shapiro word +1 +1 +1 −1 +1 +1 −1 +1 +1 +1 +1 −1 −1 −1 +1 −1 ..., which is created by concatenating the terms of the Rudin–Shapiro sequence, is a fixed point of the morphism or string substitution rules   +1 +1 → +1 +1 +1 −1  +1 −1 → +1 +1 −1 +1  −1 +1 → −1 −1 +1 −1  −1 −1 → −1 −1 −1 +1   as follows:   +1 +1 → +1 +1 +1 −1 → +1 +1 +1 −1 +1 +1 −1 +1 → +1 +1 +1 −1 +1 +1 −1 +1 +1 +1 +1 −1 −1 −1 +1 −1 ...   It can be seen from the morphism rules that the Rudin–Shapiro string contains at most four consecutive +1s and at most four consecutive −1s.
