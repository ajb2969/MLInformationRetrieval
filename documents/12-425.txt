   Generalized Verma module      Generalized Verma module   In mathematics , generalized Verma modules are a generalization of a (true) Verma module , 1 and are objects in the representation theory of Lie algebras . They were studied originally by James Lepowsky in the nineteen seventies. The motivation for their study is that their homomorphisms correspond to invariant differential operators over generalized flag manifolds . The study of these operators is an important part of the theory of parabolic geometries .  Definition  Let   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   be a semisimple Lie algebra and   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   a parabolic subalgebra of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . For any irreducible finite-dimensional representation    V   V   V   of   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   we define the generalized Verma module to be the relative tensor product        M  𝔭    (  V  )    :=    𝒰   (  𝔤  )     ⊗   𝒰   (  𝔭  )     V      assign     subscript  M  𝔭   V     subscript  tensor-product    𝒰  𝔭      𝒰  𝔤   V     M_{\mathfrak{p}}(V):=\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})\otimes_{\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{p%
 })}V   .  The action of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is left multiplication in    𝒰   (  𝔤  )       𝒰  𝔤    \mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g})   .  If λ is the highest weight of V, we sometimes denote the Verma module by     M  𝔭    (  λ  )        subscript  M  𝔭   λ    M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   .  Note that     M  𝔭    (  λ  )        subscript  M  𝔭   λ    M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   makes sense only for   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   -dominant and   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   -integral weights (see weight )   λ   λ   \lambda   .  It is well known that a parabolic subalgebra    𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   determines a unique grading     𝔤  =    ⊕   j  =   -  k    k    𝔤  j        𝔤    superscript   subscript  direct-sum    j    k     k    subscript  𝔤  j      \mathfrak{g}=\oplus_{j=-k}^{k}\mathfrak{g}_{j}   so that    𝔭  =    ⊕   j  ≥  0     𝔤  j        𝔭    subscript  direct-sum    j  0     subscript  𝔤  j      \mathfrak{p}=\oplus_{j\geq 0}\mathfrak{g}_{j}   . Let     𝔤  -   :=    ⊕   j  <  0     𝔤  j       assign   subscript  𝔤      subscript  direct-sum    j  0     subscript  𝔤  j      \mathfrak{g}_{-}:=\oplus_{j<0}\mathfrak{g}_{j}   . It follows from the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem that, as a vector space (and even as a    𝔤  -     subscript  𝔤     \mathfrak{g}_{-}   - module and as a    𝔤  0     subscript  𝔤  0    \mathfrak{g}_{0}   -module),        M  𝔭    (  V  )    ≃    𝒰   (   𝔤  -   )    ⊗  V      similar-to-or-equals     subscript  M  𝔭   V    tensor-product    𝒰   subscript  𝔤     V     M_{\mathfrak{p}}(V)\simeq\mathcal{U}(\mathfrak{g}_{-})\otimes V   .  In further text, we will denote a generalized Verma module simply by GVM.  Properties of GVMs  GVM's are highest weight modules and their highest weight λ is the highest weight of the representation V. If    v  λ     subscript  v  λ    v_{\lambda}   is the highest weight vector in V, then    1  ⊗   v  λ      tensor-product  1   subscript  v  λ     1\otimes v_{\lambda}   is the highest weight vector in     M  𝔭    (  λ  )        subscript  M  𝔭   λ    M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   .  GVM's are weight modules , i.e. they are direct sum of its weight spaces and these weight spaces are finite-dimensional.  As all highest weight modules , GVM's are quotients of Verma modules. The kernel of the projection      M  λ   →    M  𝔭    (  λ  )       normal-→   subscript  M  λ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ     M_{\lambda}\to M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   is        (  1  )    K  λ    :=    ∑   α  ∈  S     M    s  α   ⋅  λ     ⊂   M  λ        assign   1   subscript  K  λ      subscript     α  S     subscript  M   normal-⋅   subscript  s  α   λ           subscript  M  λ      (1)\quad K_{\lambda}:=\sum_{\alpha\in S}M_{s_{\alpha}\cdot\lambda}\subset M_{\lambda}   where    S  ⊂  Δ      S  normal-Δ    S\subset\Delta   is the set of those simple roots α such that the negative root spaces of root    -  α      α    -\alpha   are in   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   (the set S determines uniquely the subalgebra   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   ),    s  α     subscript  s  α    s_{\alpha}   is the root reflection with respect to the root α and     s  α   ⋅  λ     normal-⋅   subscript  s  α   λ    s_{\alpha}\cdot\lambda   is the affine action of    s  α     subscript  s  α    s_{\alpha}   on λ. It follows from the theory of (true) Verma modules that    M    s  α   ⋅  λ      subscript  M   normal-⋅   subscript  s  α   λ     M_{s_{\alpha}\cdot\lambda}   is isomorphic to a unique submodule of    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   . In (1), we identified     M    s  α   ⋅  λ    ⊂   M  λ        subscript  M   normal-⋅   subscript  s  α   λ     subscript  M  λ     M_{s_{\alpha}\cdot\lambda}\subset M_{\lambda}   . The sum in (1) is not direct .  In the special case when    S  =  ∅      S     S=\emptyset   , the parabolic subalgebra   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is the Borel subalgebra and the GVM coincides with (true) Verma module. In the other extremal case when    S  =  Δ      S  normal-Δ    S=\Delta   ,    𝔭  =  𝔤      𝔭  𝔤    \mathfrak{p}=\mathfrak{g}   and the GVM is isomorphic to the inducing representation V.  The GVM     M  𝔭    (  λ  )        subscript  M  𝔭   λ    M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   is called regular , if its highest weight λ is on the affine Weyl orbit of a dominant weight    λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   . In other word, there exist an element w of the Weyl group W such that      λ  =   w  ⋅   λ  ~        λ   normal-⋅  w   normal-~  λ      \lambda=w\cdot\tilde{\lambda}   where   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   is the affine action of the Weyl group.  The Verma module    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   is called singular , if there is no dominant weight on the affine orbit of λ. In this case, there exists a weight    λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   so that     λ  ~   +  δ       normal-~  λ   δ    \tilde{\lambda}+\delta   is on the wall of the fundamental Weyl chamber (δ is the sum of all fundamental weights ).  Homomorphisms of GVMs  By a homomorphism of GVMs we mean   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -homomorphism.  For any two weights    λ  ,  μ     λ  μ    \lambda,\mu   a homomorphism        M  𝔭    (  μ  )    →    M  𝔭    (  λ  )       normal-→     subscript  M  𝔭   μ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ     M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mu)\rightarrow M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)     may exist only if   μ   μ   \mu   and   λ   λ   \lambda   are linked with an affine action of the Weyl group    W   W   W   of the Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . This follows easily from the Harish-Chandra theorem on infinitesimal central characters .  Unlike in the case of (true) Verma modules , the homomorphisms of GVM's are in general not injective and the dimension      d  i  m   (   H  o  m   (    M  𝔭    (  μ  )    ,    M  𝔭    (  λ  )    )    )       d  i  m    H  o  m      subscript  M  𝔭   μ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ       dim(Hom(M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mu),M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)))     may be larger than one in some specific cases.  If    f  :    M  μ   →   M  λ       normal-:  f   normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ      f:M_{\mu}\to M_{\lambda}   is a homomorphism of (true) Verma modules,    K  μ     subscript  K  μ    K_{\mu}   resp.    K  λ     subscript  K  λ    K_{\lambda}   is the kernels of the projection     M  μ   →    M  𝔭    (  μ  )       normal-→   subscript  M  μ      subscript  M  𝔭   μ     M_{\mu}\to M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mu)   , resp.     M  λ   →    M  𝔭    (  λ  )       normal-→   subscript  M  λ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ     M_{\lambda}\to M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   , then there exists a homomorphism     K  μ   →   K  λ      normal-→   subscript  K  μ    subscript  K  λ     K_{\mu}\to K_{\lambda}   and f factors to a homomorphism of generalized Verma modules      M  𝔭    (  μ  )    →    M  𝔭    (  λ  )       normal-→     subscript  M  𝔭   μ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ     M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mu)\to M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   . Such a homomorphism (that is a factor of a homomorphism of Verma modules) is called standard . However, the standard homomorphism may be zero in some cases.  Standard  Let us suppose that there exists a nontrivial homomorphism of true Verma moduls     M  μ   →   M  λ      normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     M_{\mu}\to M_{\lambda}   . Let    S  ⊂  Δ      S  normal-Δ    S\subset\Delta   be the set of those simple roots α such that the negative root spaces of root    -  α      α    -\alpha   are in   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   (like in section Properties ). The following theorem is proved by Lepowsky : 2   The standard homomorphism      M  𝔭    (  μ  )    →    M  𝔭    (  λ  )       normal-→     subscript  M  𝔭   μ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ     M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mu)\to M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   is zero if and only if there exists    α  ∈  S      α  S    \alpha\in S   such that    M  μ     subscript  M  μ    M_{\mu}   is isomorphic to a submodule of    M    s  α   ⋅  λ      subscript  M   normal-⋅   subscript  s  α   λ     M_{s_{\alpha}\cdot\lambda}   (    s  α     subscript  s  α    s_{\alpha}   is the corresponding root reflection and   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   is the affine action ).   The structure of GVMs on the affine orbit of a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -dominant and   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -integral weight     λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   can be described explicitly. If W is the Weyl group of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , there exists a subset     W  𝔭   ⊂  W       superscript  W  𝔭   W    W^{\mathfrak{p}}\subset W   of such elements, so that     w  ∈   W  𝔭    ⇔   w   (   λ  ~   )       normal-⇔    w   superscript  W  𝔭      w   normal-~  λ      w\in W^{\mathfrak{p}}\Leftrightarrow w(\tilde{\lambda})   is   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   -dominant. It can be shown that     W  𝔭   ≃    W  𝔭   \  W      similar-to-or-equals   superscript  W  𝔭    normal-\   subscript  W  𝔭   W     W^{\mathfrak{p}}\simeq W_{\mathfrak{p}}\backslash W   where    W  𝔭     subscript  W  𝔭    W_{\mathfrak{p}}   is the Weyl group of   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   (in particular,    W  𝔭     superscript  W  𝔭    W^{\mathfrak{p}}   does not depend on the choice of    λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   ). The map    w  ∈   W  𝔭   ↦    M  𝔭    (   w  ⋅   λ  ~    )          w   superscript  W  𝔭     maps-to       subscript  M  𝔭    normal-⋅  w   normal-~  λ        w\in W^{\mathfrak{p}}\mapsto M_{\mathfrak{p}}(w\cdot\tilde{\lambda})   is a bijection between    W  𝔭     superscript  W  𝔭    W^{\mathfrak{p}}   and the set of GVM's with highest weights on the affine orbit of    λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   . Let as suppose that    μ  =    w  ′   ⋅   λ  ~        μ   normal-⋅   superscript  w  normal-′    normal-~  λ      \mu=w^{\prime}\cdot\tilde{\lambda}   ,    λ  =   w  ⋅   λ  ~        λ   normal-⋅  w   normal-~  λ      \lambda=w\cdot\tilde{\lambda}   and    w  ≤   w  ′       w   superscript  w  normal-′     w\leq w^{\prime}   in the Bruhat ordering (otherwise, there is no homomorphism of (true) Verma modules     M  μ   →   M  λ      normal-→   subscript  M  μ    subscript  M  λ     M_{\mu}\to M_{\lambda}   and the standard homomorphism does not make sense, see Homomorphisms of Verma modules ).  The following statements follow from the above theorem and the structure of    W  𝔭     superscript  W  𝔭    W^{\mathfrak{p}}   :   Theorem. If     w  ′   =    s  γ   w        superscript  w  normal-′      subscript  s  γ   w     w^{\prime}=s_{\gamma}w   for some positive root    γ   γ   \gamma   and the length (see Bruhat ordering ) l(w')=l(w)+1, then there exists a nonzero standard homomorphism      M  𝔭    (  μ  )    →    M  𝔭    (  λ  )       normal-→     subscript  M  𝔭   μ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ     M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mu)\to M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   .    Theorem . The standard homomorphism      M  𝔭    (  μ  )    →    M  𝔭    (  λ  )       normal-→     subscript  M  𝔭   μ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ     M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mu)\to M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   is zero if and only if there exists     w  ′′   ∈  W       superscript  w  ′′   W    w^{\prime\prime}\in W   such that    w  ≤   w  ′′   ≤   w  ′         w   superscript  w  ′′         superscript  w  normal-′      w\leq w^{\prime\prime}\leq w^{\prime}   and     w  ′′   ∉   W  𝔭        superscript  w  ′′    superscript  W  𝔭     w^{\prime\prime}\notin W^{\mathfrak{p}}   .   However, if    λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   is only dominant but not integral, there may still exist   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   -dominant and   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   -integral weights on its affine orbit.  The situation is even more complicated if the GVM's have singular character, i.e. there   μ   μ   \mu   and   λ   λ   \lambda   are on the affine orbit of some    λ  ~     normal-~  λ    \tilde{\lambda}   such that     λ  ~   +  δ       normal-~  λ   δ    \tilde{\lambda}+\delta   is on the wall of the fundamental Weyl chamber .  Nonstandard  A homomorphism      M  𝔭    (  μ  )    →    M  𝔭    (  λ  )       normal-→     subscript  M  𝔭   μ      subscript  M  𝔭   λ     M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\mu)\to M_{\mathfrak{p}}(\lambda)   is called nonstandard , if it is not standard. It may happen that the standard homomorphism of GVMs is zero but there still exists a nonstandard homomorphism.
