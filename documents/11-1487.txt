   Fucokinase      Fucokinase   In enzymology , a fucokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-fucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + beta-L-fucose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-fucose , whereas its two products are ADP and beta-L-fucose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:beta-L-fucose 1-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include fucokinase (phosphorylating) , fucose kinase , L-fucose kinase , L-fucokinase , ATP:6-deoxy-L-galactose 1-phosphotransferase , and ATP:L-fucose 1-phosphotransferase . Fucokinase is commonly abbreviated as fuc-K . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
