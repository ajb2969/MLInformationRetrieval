   Reduction criterion      Reduction criterion   In quantum information theory , the reduction criterion is a necessary condition a mixed state must satisfy in order for it to be separable . In other words, the reduction criterion is a separability criterion . It was first proved in 1 and independently formulated in. 2 Violation of the reduction criterion is closely related to the distillability of the state in question. 3  Details  Let H 1 and H 2 be Hilbert spaces of finite dimensions n and m respectively. L ( H i ) will denote the space of linear operators acting on H i . Consider a bipartite quantum system whose state space is the tensor product       H  =    H  1   ⊗   H  2     .      H   tensor-product   subscript  H  1    subscript  H  2      H=H_{1}\otimes H_{2}.     An (un-normalized) mixed state ρ is a positive linear operator (density matrix) acting on H .  A linear map Φ: L ( H 2 ) → L ( H 1 ) is said to be positive if it preserves the cone of positive elements, i.e. A is positive implied Φ ( A ) is also.  From the one-to-one correspondence between positive maps and entanglement witnesses , we have that a state ρ is entangled if and only if there exists a positive map Φ such that       (   I  ⊗  Φ   )    (  ρ  )        tensor-product  I  normal-Φ   ρ    (I\otimes\Phi)(\rho)     is not positive. Therefore, if ρ is separable, then for all positive map Φ,        (   I  ⊗  Φ   )    (  ρ  )    ≥  0.         tensor-product  I  normal-Φ   ρ   0.    (I\otimes\Phi)(\rho)\geq 0.     Thus every positive, but not completely positive , map Φ gives rise to a necessary condition for separability in this way. The reduction criterion is a particular example of this.  Suppose H 1 = H 2 . Define the positive map Φ: L ( H 2 ) → L ( H 1 ) by        Φ   (  A  )    =    Tr  A   -  A    .        normal-Φ  A      Tr  A   A     \Phi(A)=\operatorname{Tr}A-A.     It is known that Φ is positive but not completely positive. So a mixed state ρ being separable implies        (   I  ⊗  Φ   )    (  ρ  )    ≥  0.         tensor-product  I  normal-Φ   ρ   0.    (I\otimes\Phi)(\rho)\geq 0.     Direct calculation shows that the above expression is the same as        I  ⊗   ρ  1    -  ρ   ≥  0         tensor-product  I   subscript  ρ  1    ρ   0    I\otimes\rho_{1}-\rho\geq 0     where ρ 1 is the partial trace of ρ with respect to the second system. The dual relation         ρ  2   ⊗  I   -  ρ   ≥  0         tensor-product   subscript  ρ  2   I   ρ   0    \rho_{2}\otimes I-\rho\geq 0     is obtained in the analogous fashion. The reduction criterion consists of the above two inequalities.  References   4  5   "  Category:Quantum information science        ↩  ↩
