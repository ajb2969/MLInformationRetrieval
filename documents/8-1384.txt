Reduction criterion

In quantum information theory, the reduction criterion is a necessary condition a mixed state must satisfy in order for it to be separable. In other words, the reduction criterion is a separability criterion. It was first proved in 1 and independently formulated in.2 Violation of the reduction criterion is closely related to the distillability of the state in question.3

Let H1 and H2 be Hilbert spaces of finite dimensions n and m respectively. L(Hi) will denote the space of linear operators acting on Hi. Consider a bipartite quantum system whose state space is the tensor product



An (un-normalized) mixed state ρ is a positive linear operator (density matrix) acting on H.
A linear map Φ: L(H2) → L(H1) is said to be positive if it preserves the cone of positive elements, i.e. A is positive implied Φ(A) is also.
From the one-to-one correspondence between positive maps and entanglement witnesses, we have that a state ρ is entangled if and only if there exists a positive map Φ such that



is not positive. Therefore, if ρ is separable, then for all positive map Φ,



Thus every positive, but not completely positive, map Φ gives rise to a necessary condition for separability in this way. The reduction criterion is a particular example of this.
Suppose H1 = H2. Define the positive map Φ: L(H2) → L(H1) by



It is known that Φ is positive but not completely positive. So a mixed state ρ being separable implies



Direct calculation shows that the above expression is the same as



where ρ1 is the partial trace of ρ with respect to the second system. The dual relation



is obtained in the analogous fashion. The reduction criterion consists of the above two inequalities.
