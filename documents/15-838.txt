Prosolanapyrone-II oxidase

Prosolanapyrone-II oxidase (, Sol5, SPS, solanapyrone synthase (bifunctional enzyme: prosolanapyrone II oxidase/prosolanapyrone III cycloisomerase), prosolanapyrone II oxidase) is an enzyme with system name prosolanapyrone-II:oxygen 3'-oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

prosolanapyrone II + O2

 
  prosolanapyrone III + H2O2


This enzyme participates in the biosynthesis of the phytotoxin solanapyrone by some fungi.
