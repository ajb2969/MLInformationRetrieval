Transmittance

 
Transmittance of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in transmitting radiant energy. It is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is transmitted through a sample, in contrast to the transmission coefficient, which is the ratio of the transmitted to incident electric field.1
Internal transmittance refers to energy loss by absorption, whereas (total) transmittance is that due to absorption, scattering, reflection, etc.
Mathematical definitions
Hemispherical transmittance
Hemispherical transmittance of a surface, denoted T, is defined as2


 
  where

Φet is the radiant flux transmitted by that surface;
Φei is the radiant flux received by that surface.

Spectral hemispherical transmittance
Spectral hemispherical transmittance in frequency and spectral hemispherical transmittance in wavelength of a surface, denoted Tν and Tλ respectively, are defined as3





 
  where

Φe,νt is the spectral radiant flux in frequency transmitted by that surface;
Φe,νi is the spectral radiant flux in frequency received by that surface;
Φe,λt is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength transmitted by that surface;
Φe,λi is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength received by that surface.

Directional transmittance
Directional transmittance of a surface, denoted TΩ, is defined as4


 
  where

Le,Ωt is the radiance transmitted by that surface;
Le,Ωi is the radiance received by that surface.

Spectral directional transmittance
Spectral directional transmittance in frequency and spectral directional transmittance in wavelength of a surface, denoted Tν,Ω and Tλ,Ω respectively, are defined as5





 
  where

Le,Ω,νt is the spectral radiance in frequency transmitted by that surface;
Le,Ω,νi is the spectral radiance received by that surface;
Le,Ω,λt is the spectral radiance in wavelength transmitted by that surface;
Le,Ω,λi is the spectral radiance in wavelength received by that surface.

Beer–Lambert law
By definition, transmittance is related to optical depth and to absorbance as


 
  where

τ is the optical depth;
A is the absorbance.

The Beer–Lambert law states that, for N attenuating species in the material sample,


 
  or equivalently that





 
  where

σi is the attenuation cross section of the attenuating specie i in the material sample;
ni is the number density of the attenuating specie i in the material sample;
εi is the molar attenuation coefficient of the attenuating specie i in the material sample;
ci is the amount concentration of the attenuating specie i in the material sample;
ℓ is the path length of the beam of light through the material sample.

Attenuation cross section and molar attenuation coefficient are related by


 
  and number density and amount concentration by


 
  where NA is the Avogadro constant.
In case of uniform attenuation, these relations become6


 
  or equivalently






Cases of non-uniform attenuation occur in atmospheric science applications and radiation shielding theory for instance.
