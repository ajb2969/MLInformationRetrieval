Marchenko equation

In mathematical physics, more specific in the one-dimensional inverse scattering problem, the Marchenko equation, named after Vladimir Marchenko, is derived by computing the Fourier transform of the scattering relation:



where



is a symmetric kernel, so that



which is computed from the scattering data. Solving the Marchenko equation one obtains the kernel of the transformation operator 
 
 
 
 
  from which the potential can be read off.
This equation is derived from the Gel'fand-Levitan integral equation, using the Povzner-Levitan representation.
