   Conditioned disjunction      Conditioned disjunction   In logic, conditioned disjunction (sometimes called conditional disjunction ) is a ternary  logical connective introduced by Church . 1 Given operands p , q , and r , which represent truth-valued  propositions , the meaning of the conditioned disjunction  is given by:       [  p  ,  q  ,  r  ]   ↔   (  q  →  p  )   and   (  ¬  q  →  r  )      fragments   fragments  normal-[  p  normal-,  q  normal-,  r  normal-]   normal-↔   fragments  normal-(  q  normal-→  p  normal-)   and   fragments  normal-(   q  normal-→  r  normal-)     [p,q,r]~{}\leftrightarrow~{}(q\rightarrow p)\and(\neg q\rightarrow r)   In words,  is equivalent to: "if q then p , else r ", or " p or r , according as q or not q ". This may also be stated as " q implies p and, not q implies r ". So, for any values of p , q , and r , the value of  is the value of p when q is true, and is the value of r otherwise.  The conditioned disjunction is also equivalent to:       (   q  and  p   )    (   ¬  q  and  r   )         q  italic- and  p      q  italic- and  r     (q\and p)(\neg q\and r)   and has the same truth table as the "ternary" ( ?: ) operator in many programming languages.  In conjunction with truth constants denoting each truth-value, conditioned disjunction is truth-functionally complete for classical logic . 2 Its truth table is the following:      Conditioned disjunction     p     T     T     T     T     F     F     F     F     There are other truth-functionally complete ternary connectives.
