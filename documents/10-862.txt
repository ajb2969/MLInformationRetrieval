Xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + xanthotoxol 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + O-methylxanthotoxol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and xanthotoxol, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and O-methylxanthotoxol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase. This enzyme is also called xanthotoxol methyltransferase.
