Hall's universal group

In algebra, Hall's universal group is a countable locally finite group, say U, which is uniquely characterized by the following properties.

Every finite group G admits a monomorphism to U.


All such monomorphisms are conjugate by inner automorphisms of U.

It was defined by Philip Hall in 1959,1 and has the universal property that all countable locally finite groups embed into it.
Construction
Take any group 
 
 
 
  of order 
 
 
 
 . Denote by 
 
 
 
  the group 
 
 
 
  of permutations of elements of 
 
 
 
 , by 
 
 
 
  the group



and so on. Since a group acts faithfully on itself by permutations



according to Cayley's theorem, this gives a chain of monomorphisms



A direct limit (that is, a union) of all 
 
 
 
  is Hall's universal group U.
Indeed, U then contains a symmetric group of arbitrarily large order, and any group admits a monomorphism to a group of permutations, as explained above. Let G be a finite group admitting two embeddings to U. Since U is a direct limit and G is finite, the images of these two embeddings belong to 
 
 
 
 . The group 
 
 
 
  acts on 
 
 
 
  by permutations, and conjugates all possible embeddings 
 
 
 
 .
