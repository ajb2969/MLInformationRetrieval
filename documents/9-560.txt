   Hall's universal group      Hall's universal group   In algebra , Hall's universal group is a countable locally finite group , say U , which is uniquely characterized by the following properties.   Every finite group G admits a monomorphism to U .    All such monomorphisms are conjugate by inner automorphisms of U .   It was defined by Philip Hall in 1959, 1 and has the universal property that all countable locally finite groups embed into it.  Construction  Take any group    Γ  0     subscript  normal-Γ  0    \Gamma_{0}   of order     ≥  3      absent  3    \geq 3   . Denote by    Γ  1     subscript  normal-Γ  1    \Gamma_{1}   the group    S   Γ  0      subscript  S   subscript  normal-Γ  0     S_{\Gamma_{0}}   of permutations of elements of    Γ  0     subscript  normal-Γ  0    \Gamma_{0}   , by    Γ  2     subscript  normal-Γ  2    \Gamma_{2}   the group       S   Γ  1    =    S   S   Γ  0           subscript  S   subscript  normal-Γ  1     subscript  S   subscript  S   subscript  normal-Γ  0       S_{\Gamma_{1}}=S_{S_{\Gamma_{0}}}\,     and so on. Since a group acts faithfully on itself by permutations      x  ↦   g   x       maps-to  x    g  x     x\mapsto gx\,     according to Cayley's theorem , this gives a chain of monomorphisms        Γ  0   ↪   Γ  1   ↪   Γ  2   ↪  ⋯   .       normal-↪   subscript  normal-Γ  0    subscript  normal-Γ  1     normal-↪     subscript  normal-Γ  2     normal-↪    normal-⋯     \Gamma_{0}\hookrightarrow\Gamma_{1}\hookrightarrow\Gamma_{2}\hookrightarrow%
 \cdots.\,     A direct limit (that is, a union) of all    Γ  i     subscript  normal-Γ  i    \Gamma_{i}   is Hall's universal group U .  Indeed, U then contains a symmetric group of arbitrarily large order, and any group admits a monomorphism to a group of permutations , as explained above. Let G be a finite group admitting two embeddings to U . Since U is a direct limit and G is finite, the images of these two embeddings belong to     Γ  i   ⊂  U       subscript  normal-Γ  i   U    \Gamma_{i}\subset U   . The group     Γ   i  +  1    =   S   Γ  i         subscript  normal-Γ    i  1     subscript  S   subscript  normal-Γ  i      \Gamma_{i+1}=S_{\Gamma_{i}}   acts on    Γ  i     subscript  normal-Γ  i    \Gamma_{i}   by permutations, and conjugates all possible embeddings    G  ↪  U     normal-↪  G  U    G\hookrightarrow U   .
