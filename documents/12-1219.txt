   Megagon      Megagon   A megagon is a polygon with 1 million sides ( mega- , from the Greek μέγας megas, meaning "great"). 1 2 Even if drawn at the size of the Earth, a regular megagon would be very difficult to distinguish from a circle .  A regular megagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {1000000} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated 500000-gon, t{500000}, which alternates two types of edges.  Properties  A regular megagon has an interior angle of 179.99964°. 3 The area of a regular megagon with sides of length a is given by       A  =   250000   a  2    cot   π  1000000      .      A    250000   superscript  a  2       π  1000000       A=250000a^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{1000000}.     The perimeter of a regular megagon inscribed in the unit circle is:       2000000   sin   π  1000000     ,      2000000      π  1000000      2000000\sin\frac{\pi}{1000000},   which is very close to 2π. In fact, for a circle the size of the Earth 's equator, with a circumference of 40,075 kilometres, one edge of a megagon inscribed in such a circle would be about 40 meters long. The difference between the perimeter of the inscribed megagon and the circumference of this circle comes to less than 1/16 millimeters. 4  Because 1000000 = 2 6 × 5 6 , the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Fermat primes nor a power of two. Thus the regular megagon is not a constructible polygon . Indeed, it is not even constructible with the use of neusis or an angle trisector, as the number of sides is neither a product of distinct Pierpont primes , nor a power of two, three, or six.  Philosophical application  Like René Descartes ' example of the chiliagon , the million-sided polygon has been used as an illustration of a well-defined concept that cannot be visualised. 5 6 7 8 9 10 11  The megagon is also used as an illustration of the convergence of regular polygons to a circle. 12  Megagram  A megagram is an million-sided star polygon . There are 199,999 regular forms 13 given by Schläfli symbols of the form {1000000/ n }, where n is an integer between 2 and 500,000 that is coprime to 1,000,000. There are also 300,000 regular star figures in the remaining cases.  References  "  Category:Polygons      Dugopolski, Mark, College Algebra and Trigonometry , 2nd ed, Addison-Wesley, 1999. Page 505.
