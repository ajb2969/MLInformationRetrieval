Chlorogenate hydrolase




Chlorogenate hydrolase

In enzymology, a chlorogenate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

chlorogenate + H2O 
 
 
 
  caffeate + quinate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chlorogenate and H2O, whereas its two products are caffeate and quinate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chlorogenate hydrolase. Other names in common use include chlorogenase, and chlorogenic acid esterase.
