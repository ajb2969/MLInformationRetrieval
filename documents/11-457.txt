   Chlorogenate hydrolase      Chlorogenate hydrolase   In enzymology , a chlorogenate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   chlorogenate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   caffeate + quinate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are chlorogenate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are caffeate and quinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is chlorogenate hydrolase . Other names in common use include chlorogenase , and chlorogenic acid esterase .  References      "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
