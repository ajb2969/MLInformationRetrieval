   Secular equilibrium      Secular equilibrium   In nuclear physics , secular equilibrium is a situation in which the quantity of a radioactive  isotope remains constant because its production rate (e.g., due to decay of a parent isotope) is equal to its decay rate.  Secular equilibrium in radioactive decay  Secular equilibrium can only occur in a radioactive decay chain if the half-life of the daughter radionuclide B is much shorter than the half-life of the parent radionuclide A. In such a situation, the decay rate of A, and hence the production rate of B, is approximately constant, because the half-life of A is very long compared to the timescales being considered. The quantity of radionuclide B builds up until the number of B atoms decaying per unit time becomes equal to the number being produced per unit time; the quantity of radionuclide B then reaches a constant, equilibrium value. Assuming the initial concentration of radionuclide B is zero, full equilibrium usually takes several half-lives of radionuclide B to establish.  The quantity of radionuclide B when secular equilibrium is reached is determined by the quantity of its parent A and the half-lives of the two radionuclide. This can be seen from the time rate of change of the number of atoms of radionuclide B:        d   N  B     d  t    =     λ  A    N  A    -    λ  B    N  B             d   subscript  N  B      d  t         subscript  λ  A    subscript  N  A       subscript  λ  B    subscript  N  B       \frac{dN_{B}}{dt}=\lambda_{A}N_{A}-\lambda_{B}N_{B}   ,  where λ A and λ B are the decay constants of radionuclide A and B, related to their half-lives t 1/2 by    λ  =    l  n   (  2  )    /   t   1  /  2         λ      l  n  2    subscript  t    1  2       \lambda=ln(2)/t_{1/2}   , and N A and N B are the number of atoms of A and B at a given time.  Secular equilibrium occurs when       d   N  B    /  d   t   =  0            d   subscript  N  B    d   t   0    dN_{B}/dt=0   , or       N  B   =     λ  A    λ  B     N  A         subscript  N  B        subscript  λ  A    subscript  λ  B     subscript  N  A      N_{B}=\frac{\lambda_{A}}{\lambda_{B}}N_{A}   .  Over long enough times, comparable to the half-life of radionuclide A, the secular equilibrium is only approximate; N A decays away according to        N  A    (  t  )    =    N  A    (  0  )    e   -    λ  A   t             subscript  N  A   t      subscript  N  A   0   superscript  e       subscript  λ  A   t        N_{A}(t)=N_{A}(0)e^{-\lambda_{A}t}   ,  and the "equilibrium" quantity of radionuclide B declines in turn. For times short compared to the half-life of A,      λ  A   t   ≪  1     much-less-than     subscript  λ  A   t   1    \lambda_{A}t\ll 1   and the exponential can be approximated as 1.
