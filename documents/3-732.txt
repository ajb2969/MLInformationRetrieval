   Random Fibonacci sequence      Random Fibonacci sequence   In mathematics, the random Fibonacci sequence is a stochastic analogue of the Fibonacci sequence defined by the recurrence relation  f n = f n −1 ± f n −2 , where the signs + or − are chosen at random with equal probability 1/2, independently for different n . By a theorem of Harry Kesten and Hillel Furstenberg , random recurrent sequences of this kind grow at a certain exponential rate , but it is difficult to compute the rate explicitly. In 1999, Divakar Viswanath showed that the growth rate of the random Fibonacci sequence is equal to 1.1319882487943…, a mathematical constant that was later named Viswanath's constant. 1 2 3  Description  The random Fibonacci sequence is an integer random sequence { f n }, where f 1 = f 2 = 1 and the subsequent terms are determined from the random recurrence relation       f  n   =   {        f   n  -  1    +   f   n  -  2     ,      with probability 1/2  ;          f   n  -  1    -   f   n  -  2     ,      with probability 1/2  .            subscript  f  n    cases     subscript  f    n  1     subscript  f    n  2     with probability 1/2     subscript  f    n  1     subscript  f    n  2     with probability 1/2     f_{n}=\begin{cases}f_{n-1}+f_{n-2},&\text{ with probability 1/2};\\
 f_{n-1}-f_{n-2},&\text{ with probability 1/2}.\end{cases}     A run of the random Fibonacci sequence starts with 1,1 and the value of the each subsequent term is determined by a fair coin toss: given two consecutive elements of the sequence, the next element is either their sum or their difference with probability 1/2, independently of all the choices made previously. If in the random Fibonacci sequence the plus sign is chosen at each step, the corresponding run is the Fibonacci sequence { F n },       1  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  5  ,  8  ,  13  ,  21  ,  34  ,  55  ,  …   .     1  1  2  3  5  8  13  21  34  55  normal-…    1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,\ldots.     If the signs alternate in minus-plus-plus-minus-plus-plus-... pattern, the result is the sequence       1  ,  1  ,  0  ,  1  ,  1  ,  0  ,  1  ,  1  ,  0  ,  1  ,  …   .     1  1  0  1  1  0  1  1  0  1  normal-…    1,1,0,1,1,0,1,1,0,1,\ldots.     However, such patterns occur with vanishing probability in a random experiment. In a typical run, the terms will not follow a predictable pattern:       1  ,  1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  1  ,   -  2   ,   -  3   ,   -  5   ,   -  2   ,   -  3   ,    …  for the signs   +   ,  +  ,  +  ,  -  ,  -  ,  +  ,  -  ,  -  ,  …   .     1  1  2  3  1    2     3     5     2     3    limit-from    normal-…  for the signs            normal-…    1,1,2,3,1,-2,-3,-5,-2,-3,\ldots\text{ for the signs }+,+,+,-,-,+,-,-,\ldots.     Similarly to the deterministic case, the random Fibonacci sequence may be profitably described via matrices:        (      f   n  -  1         f  n      )   =    (     0    1       ±  1     1     )    (      f   n  -  2         f   n  -  1       )     ,       binomial   subscript  f    n  1     subscript  f  n        0  1     plus-or-minus  1   1     binomial   subscript  f    n  2     subscript  f    n  1        {f_{n-1}\choose f_{n}}=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 \pm 1&1\end{pmatrix}{f_{n-2}\choose f_{n-1}},     where the signs are chosen independently for different n with equal probabilities for + or −. Thus        (      f   n  -  1         f  n      )   =    M  n    M   n  -  1    …   M  3    (      f  1        f  2      )     ,       binomial   subscript  f    n  1     subscript  f  n       subscript  M  n    subscript  M    n  1    normal-…   subscript  M  3    binomial   subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2       {f_{n-1}\choose f_{n}}=M_{n}M_{n-1}\ldots M_{3}{f_{1}\choose f_{2}},     where { M k } is a sequence of independent identically distributed random matrices taking values A or B with probability 1/2:        A  =   (     0    1      1    1     )    ,   B  =   (     0    1       -  1     1     )     .     formulae-sequence    A    0  1    1  1       B    0  1      1   1       A=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 1&1\end{pmatrix},\quad B=\begin{pmatrix}0&1\\
 -1&1\end{pmatrix}.     Growth rate  Johannes Kepler discovered that as n increases, the ratio of the successive terms of the Fibonacci sequence { F n } approaches the golden ratio      φ  =    (   1  +   5    )   /  2    ,      φ      1    5    2     \varphi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2,   which is approximately 1.61803. In 1765, Leonhard Euler published an explicit formula, known today as the Binet formula ,        F  n   =     φ  n   -    (   -   1  /  φ    )   n     5     .       subscript  F  n        superscript  φ  n    superscript      1  φ    n      5      F_{n}={{\varphi^{n}-(-1/\varphi)^{n}}\over{\sqrt{5}}}.     It demonstrates that the Fibonacci numbers grow at an exponential rate equal to the golden ratio φ .  In 1960, Hillel Furstenberg and Harry Kesten showed that for a general class of random matrix products, the norm grows as λ n , where n is the number of factors. Their results apply to a broad class of random sequence generating processes that includes the random Fibonacci sequence. As a consequence, the n th root of | f n | converges to a constant value almost surely , or with probability one:         |   f  n   |   n   →   1.13198824  …  as  n   →  ∞   .       normal-→     n      subscript  f  n       1.13198824  normal-…  as  n     normal-→        \sqrt[n]{|f_{n}|}\to 1.13198824\dots\text{ as }n\to\infty.     An explicit expression for this constant was found by Divakar Viswanath in 1999. It uses Furstenberg's formula for the Lyapunov exponent of a random matrix product and integration over a certain fractal measure on the Stern–Brocot tree . Moreover, Viswanath computed the numerical value above using floating point arithmetics validated by an analysis of the rounding error .
