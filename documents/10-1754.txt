   Glucosaminate ammonia-lyase      Glucosaminate ammonia-lyase   In enzymology , a glucosaminate ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucosaminate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate + NH 3    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-glucosaminate , and two products , 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucosaminate ammonia-lyase (isomerizing 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-gluconate-forming) . Other names in common use include glucosaminic dehydrase , D-glucosaminate dehydratase , D-glucosaminic acid dehydrase , aminodeoxygluconate dehydratase , 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-gluconate hydro-lyase (deaminating) , aminodeoxygluconate ammonia-lyase , 2-amino-2-deoxy-D-gluconate ammonia-lyase , and D-glucosaminate ammonia-lyase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
