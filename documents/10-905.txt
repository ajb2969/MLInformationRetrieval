   Biochanin-A reductase      Biochanin-A reductase   In enzymology , a biochanin-A reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dihydrobiochanin A + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   biochanin A + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dihydrobiochanin A and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are biochanin A , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dihydrobiochanin-A:NADP+ Delta2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in isoflavonoid biosynthesis .
