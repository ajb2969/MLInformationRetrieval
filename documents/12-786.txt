   Tutte matrix      Tutte matrix   In graph theory , the Tutte matrix  A of a graph  G = ( V , E ) is a matrix used to determine the existence of a perfect matching : that is, a set of edges which is incident with each vertex exactly once.  If the set of vertices V has n elements then the Tutte matrix is an n × n matrix A with entries  $$A_{ij} = \begin{cases} x_{ij}\;\;\mbox{if}\;(i,j) \in E \mbox{ and } i j\\
 0\;\;\;\;\mbox{otherwise} \end{cases} $$  where the x ij are indeterminates. The determinant of this skew-symmetric matrix is then a polynomial (in the variables x ij , ''i
