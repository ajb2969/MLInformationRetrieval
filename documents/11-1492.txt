Gluconokinase




Gluconokinase

In enzymology, a gluconokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + D-gluconate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 6-phospho-D-gluconate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-gluconate, whereas its two products are ADP and 6-phospho-D-gluconate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-gluconate 6-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include gluconokinase (phosphorylating), and gluconate kinase. This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway.
