Craps principle

In probability theory, the craps principle is a theorem about event probabilities under repeated iid trials. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote two mutually exclusive events which might occur on a given trial. Then for each trial, the conditional probability that 
 
 
 
  occurs given that 
 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  occur is



The events 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  need not be collectively exhaustive.
Proof
Since 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are mutually exclusive,



Also due to mutual exclusion,



By conditional probability,



Combining these three yields the desired result.
Application
If the trials are repetitions of a game between two players, and the events are






then the craps principle gives the respective conditional probabilities of each player winning a certain repetition, given that someone wins (i.e., given that a draw does not occur). In fact, the result is only affected by the relative marginal probabilities of winning 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  ; in particular, the probability of a draw is irrelevant.
Stopping
If the game is played repeatedly until someone wins, then the conditional probability above turns out to be the probability that the player wins the game.
Etymology
If the game being played is craps, then this principle can greatly simplify the computation of the probability of winning in a certain scenario. Specifically, if the first roll is a 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, or 10, then the dice are repeatedly re-rolled until one of two events occurs:






Since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are mutually exclusive, the craps principle applies. For example, if the original roll was a 4, then the probability of winning is



This avoids having to sum the infinite series corresponding to all the possible outcomes:



Mathematically, we can express the probability of rolling 
 
 
 
 
  ties followed by rolling the point:



The summation becomes an infinite geometric series:









= \frac{\operatorname{P}[E_1]}{\operatorname{P}[E_1]+\operatorname{P}[E_2]} 
which agrees with the earlier result.
