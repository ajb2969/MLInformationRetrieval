   Musselman's theorem      Musselman's theorem   In Euclidean geometry , Musselman's theorem is a property of certain circles defined by an arbitrary triangle .  Specifically, let   T   T   T   be a triangle, and   A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   , and   C   C   C   its vertices . Let    A  *     superscript  A     A^{*}   ,    B  *     superscript  B     B^{*}   , and    C  *     superscript  C     C^{*}   be the vertices of the reflection triangle     T  *     superscript  T     T^{*}   , obtained by mirroring each vertex of   T   T   T   across the opposite side. 1 Let   O   O   O   be the circumcenter of   T   T   T   . Consider the three circles    S  A     subscript  S  A    S_{A}   ,    S  B     subscript  S  B    S_{B}   , and    S  C     subscript  S  C    S_{C}   defined by the points     A    O    A  *       A  O   superscript  A      A\,O\,A^{*}   ,     B    O    B  *       B  O   superscript  B      B\,O\,B^{*}   , and     C    O    C  *       C  O   superscript  C      C\,O\,C^{*}   , respectively. The theorem says that these three Musselman circles meet in a point   M   M   M   , that is the inverse with respect to the circumcenter of   T   T   T   of the isogonal conjugate or the nine-point center of   T   T   T   . 2  The common point   M   M   M   is the Gilbert point of   T   T   T   , which is point    X  1157     subscript  X  1157    X_{1157}   in Clark Kimberling's list of triangle centers . 3 4  History  The theorem was proposed as an advanced problem by J. R. Musselman and R. Goormaghtigh in 1939, 5 and a proof was presented by them in 1941. 6 A generalization of this result was stated and proved by Goormaghtigh. 7  Goormaghtigh’s generalization  The generalization of Musselman's theorem by Goormaghtigh does not mention the circles explicitly.  As before, let   A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   , and   C   C   C   be the vertices of a triangle   T   T   T   , and   O   O   O   its circumcenter. Let   H   H   H   be the orthocenter of   T   T   T   , that is, the intersection of its three altitude lines . Let    A  ′     superscript  A  normal-′    A^{\prime}   ,    B  ′     superscript  B  normal-′    B^{\prime}   , and    C  ′     superscript  C  normal-′    C^{\prime}   be three points on the segments    O  A      O  A    OA   ,    O  B      O  B    OB   , and    O  C      O  C    OC   , such that       O   A  ′    /  O   A   =     O   B  ′    /  O   B   =     O   C  ′    /  O   C   =  t              O   superscript  A  normal-′    O   A         O   superscript  B  normal-′    O   B              O   superscript  C  normal-′    O   C        t     OA^{\prime}/OA=OB^{\prime}/OB=OC^{\prime}/OC=t   . Consider the three lines    L  A     subscript  L  A    L_{A}   ,    L  B     subscript  L  B    L_{B}   , and    L  C     subscript  L  C    L_{C}   , perpendicular to    O  A      O  A    OA   ,    O  B      O  B    OB   , and    O  C      O  C    OC   though the points    A  ′     superscript  A  normal-′    A^{\prime}   ,    B  ′     superscript  B  normal-′    B^{\prime}   , and    C  ′     superscript  C  normal-′    C^{\prime}   , respectively. Let    P  A     subscript  P  A    P_{A}   ,    P  B     subscript  P  B    P_{B}   , and    P  C     subscript  P  C    P_{C}   be the intersections of these perpendicular with the lines    B  C      B  C    BC   ,    C  A      C  A    CA   , and    A  B      A  B    AB   , respectively.  It had been observed by J. Neuberg , in 1884, that the three points    P  A     subscript  P  A    P_{A}   ,    P  B     subscript  P  B    P_{B}   , and    P  C     subscript  P  C    P_{C}   lie on a common line   R   R   R   . 8 Let   N   N   N   be the projection of the circumcenter   O   O   O   on the line   R   R   R   , and    N  ′     superscript  N  normal-′    N^{\prime}   the point on    O  N      O  N    ON   such that       O   N  ′    /  O   N   =  t            O   superscript  N  normal-′    O   N   t    ON^{\prime}/ON=t   . Goormaghtigh proved that    N  ′     superscript  N  normal-′    N^{\prime}   is the inverse with respect to the circumcircle of   T   T   T   of the isogonal conjugate of the point   Q   Q   Q   on the Euler line     O  H      O  H    OH   , such that       Q  H   /  Q   O   =   2  t             Q  H   Q   O     2  t     QH/QO=2t   . 9 10  References   11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19   "  Category:Euclidean geometry  Category:Theorems in geometry               Jean-Louis Ayme (), le point de Kosnitza , page 10.
