Musselman's theorem

In Euclidean geometry, Musselman's theorem is a property of certain circles defined by an arbitrary triangle.
Specifically, let 
 
 
 
  be a triangle, and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  its vertices. Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be the vertices of the reflection triangle

 
 , obtained by mirroring each vertex of 
 
 
 
  across the opposite side.1 Let 
 
 
 
  be the circumcenter of 
 
 
 
 . Consider the three circles 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  defined by the points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. The theorem says that these three Musselman circles meet in a point 
 
 
 
 , that is the inverse with respect to the circumcenter of 
 
 
 
  of the isogonal conjugate or the nine-point center of 
 
 
 
 .2
The common point 
 
 
 
  is the Gilbert point of 
 
 
 
 , which is point 
 
 
 
  in Clark Kimberling's list of triangle centers.34
History
The theorem was proposed as an advanced problem by J. R. Musselman and R. Goormaghtigh in 1939,5 and a proof was presented by them in 1941.6 A generalization of this result was stated and proved by Goormaghtigh.7
Goormaghtigh’s generalization
The generalization of Musselman's theorem by Goormaghtigh does not mention the circles explicitly.
As before, let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be the vertices of a triangle 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  its circumcenter. Let 
 
 
 
  be the orthocenter of 
 
 
 
 , that is, the intersection of its three altitude lines. Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be three points on the segments 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 . Consider the three lines 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , perpendicular to 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  though the points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be the intersections of these perpendicular with the lines 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively.
It had been observed by J. Neuberg, in 1884, that the three points 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  lie on a common line 
 
 
 
 .8 Let 
 
 
 
  be the projection of the circumcenter 
 
 
 
  on the line 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  the point on 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Goormaghtigh proved that 
 
 
 
  is the inverse with respect to the circumcircle of 
 
 
 
  of the isogonal conjugate of the point 
 
 
 
  on the Euler line

 
 , such that
