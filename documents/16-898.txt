Quotient by an equivalence relation




Quotient by an equivalence relation

In mathematics, given a category C, a quotient of an object X by an equivalence relation

 
  is a coequalizer for the pair of maps


 
  where R is an object in C and "f is an equivalence relation" means that, for any object T in C, the image (which is a set) of 
 
 
 
  is an equivalence relation; that is, 
 
 
 
  is in it if and only if 
 
 
 
  is in it, etc.
The basic case in practice is when C is the category of all schemes over some scheme S. But the notion is flexible and one can also take C to be the category of sheaves.
Examples

Let X be a set and consider some equivalence relation on it. Let Q be the set of all equivalence classes in X. Then the map 
 
 
 
  that sends an element x to an equivalence class to which x belong is a quotient.
In the above example, Q is a subset of the power set H of X. In algebraic geometry, one might replace H by a Hilbert scheme or disjoint union of Hilbert schemes. In fact, Grothendieck constructed a relative Picard scheme of a flat projective scheme X1 as a quotient Q (of the scheme Z parametrizing relative effective divisors on X) that is a closed scheme of a Hilbert scheme H. The quotient map 
 
 
 
  can then be thought of as a relative version of the Abel map.

One also needs to assume the geometric fibers are integral schemes; Mumford's example shows the "integral" cannot be omitted.
