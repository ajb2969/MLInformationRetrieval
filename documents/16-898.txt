   Quotient by an equivalence relation      Quotient by an equivalence relation   In mathematics, given a category C , a quotient of an object X  by an equivalence relation     f  :   R  ‚Üí   X  √ó  X       normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  R    X  X      f:R\to X\times X   is a coequalizer for the pair of maps            R   ‚Üí  ùëì   X   √ó  X    ‚Üí   pr  i    X   ,  i   =  1   ,  2   ,     formulae-sequence           R   f  normal-‚Üí   X   X     subscript  pr  i   normal-‚Üí   X   i   1   2    R\overset{f}{\to}X\times X\overset{\operatorname{pr}_{i}}{\to}X,\,i=1,2,   where R is an object in C and " f is an equivalence relation" means that, for any object T in C , the image (which is a set) of    f  :    R   (  T  )    =   Mor   (  T  ,  R  )    ‚Üí     X   (  T  )    √ó  X    (  T  )        normal-:  f        R  T    Mor  T  R     normal-‚Üí          X  T   X   T       f:R(T)=\operatorname{Mor}(T,R)\to X(T)\times X(T)   is an equivalence relation ; that is,    (  x  ,  y  )     x  y    (x,y)   is in it if and only if    (  y  ,  x  )     y  x    (y,x)   is in it, etc.  The basic case in practice is when C is the category of all schemes over some scheme S . But the notion is flexible and one can also take C to be the category of sheaves .  Examples   Let X be a set and consider some equivalence relation on it. Let Q be the set of all equivalence classes in X . Then the map    q  :   X  ‚Üí  Q      normal-:  q   normal-‚Üí  X  Q     q:X\to Q   that sends an element x to an equivalence class to which x belong is a quotient.  In the above example, Q is a subset of the power set  H of X . In algebraic geometry, one might replace H by a Hilbert scheme or disjoint union of Hilbert schemes. In fact, Grothendieck constructed a relative Picard scheme of a flat projective scheme X 1 as a quotient Q (of the scheme Z parametrizing relative effective divisors on X ) that is a closed scheme of a Hilbert scheme H . The quotient map    q  :   Z  ‚Üí  Q      normal-:  q   normal-‚Üí  Z  Q     q:Z\to Q   can then be thought of as a relative version of the Abel map .
