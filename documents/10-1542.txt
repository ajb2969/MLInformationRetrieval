   Phenylalanine dehydrogenase      Phenylalanine dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a phenylalanine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-phenylalanine + H 2 O + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phenylpyruvate + NH 3 + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-phenylalanine , H 2 O , and NAD + , whereas its 4 products are phenylpyruvate , NH 3 , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-phenylalanine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include L-phenylalanine dehydrogenase , and PHD . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism and phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
