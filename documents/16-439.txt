The tessellation fills space by 8-simplex , truncated 8-simplex , bitruncated 8-simplex , tritruncated 8-simplex , and quadritruncated 8-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 2:2:2:2:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.  It can be constructed by nine sets of parallel hyperplanes that divide space. The hyperplane intersections generate cyclotruncated 7-simplex honeycomb divisions on each hyperplane.
