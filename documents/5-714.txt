Stieltjes constants

(Figure)
The area of the blue region converges on the Euler–Mascheroni constant, which is the 0th Stieltjes constant.

In mathematics, the Stieltjes constants are the numbers 
 
 
 
  that occur in the Laurent series expansion of the Riemann zeta function:



The zero'th constant 
 
 
 
  is known as the Euler–Mascheroni constant.
Representations
The Stieltjes constants are given by the limit



(In the case n = 0, the first summand requires evaluation of 00, which is taken to be 1.)
Cauchy's differentiation formula leads to the integral representation



Various representations in terms of integrals and infinite series are given in works of Jensen, Franel, Hermite, Hardy, Ramanujan, Ainsworth, Howell, Coppo, Connon, Coffey, Choi, Blagouchine and some other authors.123456 In particular, Jensen-Franel's integral formula, often erroneously attributed to Ainsworth and Howell, states that

As concerns series representations, a famous series implying an integer part of a logarithm was given by Hardy in 191212


 
  Israilov13 gave semi-convergent series in terms of Bernoulli numbers




 
  Oloa and Tauraso14 showed that series with harmonic numbers may lead to Stieltjes constants


 
  Blagouchine15 obtained slowly-convergent series involving unsigned Stirling numbers of the first kind




 
  as well as semi-convergent series with rational terms only


 
  where m=0,1,2,... Several other series are given in works of Coffey.1617
Asymptotic growth
The Stieltjes constants satisfy the bound


 
  given by Berndt in 1972.18 Better bounds were obtained by Lavrik, Israilov, Matsuoka, Nan-You, Williams, Knessl, Coffey, Adell, Saad-Eddin, Fekih-Ahmed and Blagouchine (see the list of references given in19). One of the best estimations, in terms of elementary functions, belongs to Matsuoka:



As concerns estimations resorting to non-elementary functions, Knessl, Coffey20 and Fekih-Ahmed21 obtained quite accurate results. For example, Knessl and Coffey give the following formula that approximates the Stieltjes constants relatively well for large n.22 If v is the unique solution of

Up to n = 100000, the Knessl-Coffey approximation correctly predicts the sign of γn with the single exception of n = 137.23

For large n, the Stieltjes constants grow rapidly in absolute value, and change signs in a complex pattern.
Further information related to the numerical evaluation of Stieltjes constants may be found in works of Keiper,24 Kreminski,25 Plouffe26 and Johansson.27 The latter author provided values of the Stieltjes constants up to n = 100000, accurate to over 10000 digits each. The numerical values can be retrieved from the LMFDB 1.
Generalized Stieltjes constants
General information
More generally, one can define Stieltjes constants γn(a) that occur in the Laurent series expansion of the Hurwitz zeta function:



Here a is a complex number with Re(a)>0. Since the Hurwitz zeta function is a generalization of the Riemann zeta function, we have γn(1)=γn The zero'th constant is simply the digamma-function γ0(a)=-Ψ(a),28 while other constants are not known to be reducible to any elementary or classical function of analysis. Nevertheless, there are numeorous representations for them. For example, there exists the following asymptotic representation


 
  due to Berndt and Wilton. The analog of Jensen-Franel's formula for the generalized Stieltjes constant is the Hermite formula29



Generalized Stieltjes constants satisfy the following recurrent relationship


 
  as well as the multiplication theorem


 
  where 
 
 
 
  denotes the binomial coefficient (see30 and,31 pp. 101–102).
First generalized Stieltjes constant
The first generalized Stieltjes constant has a number of remarkable properties.

Malmsten's identity (reflection formula for the first generalized Stieltjes constants): the reflection formula for the first generalized Stieltjes constant has the following form



 
  where m and n are positive integers such that mV. Adamchik. A class of logarithmic integrals. Proceedings of the 1997 International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Computation, pp. 1-8, 1997. However, very recently Blagouchine found that this identity, albeit in a slightly different form, was first obtained by Carl Malmsten in 1846.3233

Rational arguments theorem: the first generalized Stieltjes constant at rational argument may be evaluated in a quasi closed-form via the following formula



 
  due also to Blagouchine in.3435 An alternative proof was later proposed by Coffey.36

Finite summations: there are numerous summation formulae for the first generalized Stieltjes constants. For example



 
  For more details and further summation formulae, see.3738

Some particular values: some particular values of the first generalized Stieltjes constant at rational arguments may be reduced to the gamma-function, the first Stieltjes constant and elementary functions. For instance,



 
  At points 1/4, 3/4 and 1/3, values of first generalized Stieltjes constants were independently obtained by Connon39 and Blagouchine40


 
  At points 2/3, 1/6 and 5/6


 
  such values were calculated by Blagouchine.41 To the latter author are also due


 
  as well as some further values.
Second generalized Stieltjes constant
The second generalized Stieltjes constant is much less studied than the first constant. Blagouchine showed that, similarly to the first generalized Stieltjes constant, the second generalized Stieltjes constant at rational argument may be evaluated via the following formula


 
  A similar result was later obtained by Coffey by another method.42
