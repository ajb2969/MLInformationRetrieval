   Swap regret      Swap regret   Swap regret is a concept from game theory . It is a generalization of regret in a repeated, n -decision game.  Definition  A player's swap-regret is defined to be the following:       swap-regret  =    ∑   i  =  1   n      max   j  ≤  n     1  T      ∑   t  =  1   T     x  i  t   ⋅   (    p  j  t   -   p  i  t    )        .      swap-regret    superscript   subscript     i  1    n       subscript     j  n      1  T      superscript   subscript     t  1    T    normal-⋅   subscript   superscript  x  t   i      subscript   superscript  p  t   j    subscript   superscript  p  t   i          \mbox{swap-regret}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}\max_{j\leq n}\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t=1}^{T}x^{t}_%
 {i}\cdot(p^{t}_{j}-p^{t}_{i}).\,     Intuitively, it is how much a player could improve by switching each occurrence of decision i to the best decision j possible in hindsight. The swap regret is always nonnegative.  Swap regret is useful for computing correlated equilibria .  References    .   "  Category:Game theory
