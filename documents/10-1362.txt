   2-nitropropane dioxygenase      2-nitropropane dioxygenase   In enzymology , a 2-nitropropane dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 2-nitropropane + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 acetone + 2 nitrite   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-nitropropane and O 2 , whereas its two products are acetone and nitrite .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-nitropropane:oxygen 2-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in nitrogen metabolism . It has 3 cofactors : FAD , Iron , and FMN .  Structural studies  As of late 2007 Steve Fuhrer from the DHPA solved this very complex formula to find, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
