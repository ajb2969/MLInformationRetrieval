   Central angle      Central angle   (Figure)  Angle AOB forms a central angle   A central angle is an angle whose apex (vertex) is the center O of a circle and whose legs (sides) are radii intersecting the circle in two distinct points A and B thereby subtending an arc between those two points whose angle is (by definition) equal to that of the central angle itself. 1 It is also known as the arc segment 's angular distance .  When defining or drawing a central angle, in addition to specifying the points A and B, one must specify and/or denote whether the angle being defined is the convex angle (180°).   The size of a central angle Θ is: 0°<Θ<360° оr 0<Θ<2π ( radians )   Formulas   If the intersection points A and B of the legs of the angle with the circle form a diameter , then Θ=180° is a straight angle . (In radians, Θ=π.)   Let L be the minor arc of the circle between points A and B, and let R be the radius of the circle. 2     (Figure)  Angle central convex.svg      Central angle. Convex. Includes minor arc L      If the central angle Θ includes L , then         0  ∘   <  Θ  <    180  ∘     ,   Θ  =    (    180  L    π  R    )   ∘   =   L  R       formulae-sequence       superscript  0    normal-Θ        superscript  180          normal-Θ   superscript      180  L     π  R             L  R       0^{\circ}<\Theta<180^{\circ}\,,\,\,\Theta=\left({\frac{180L}{\pi R}}\right)^{%

So:      L  =     Θ   360  ∘    ⋅  2   π   R    ⇒  Θ  =    (    180  L    π  R    )   ∘         L     normal-⋅    normal-Θ   superscript  360     2   π  R     normal-⇒    normal-Θ        superscript      180  L     π  R         L=\frac{\Theta}{360^{\circ}}\cdot 2\pi R\,\Rightarrow\,\Theta=\left({\frac{180%

Does not include L     Proof (for radians): The circumference of a circle with radius R is: 2πR, and the minor arc L is the ( Θ / 2π ) proportional part of the whole circumference (see arc ). So:      L  =     Θ   2  π    ⋅  2   π   R    ⇒  Θ  =   L  R         L     normal-⋅    normal-Θ    2  π    2   π  R     normal-⇒    normal-Θ         L  R      L=\frac{\Theta}{2\pi}\cdot 2\pi R\,\Rightarrow\,\Theta=\frac{L}{R}       If the central angle Θ does not include the minor arc L , then the Θ is a reflex angle and:         180  ∘   <  Θ  <    360  ∘     ,   Θ  =    (   360  -    180  L    π  R     )   ∘   =    2  π   -   L  R        formulae-sequence       superscript  180    normal-Θ        superscript  360          normal-Θ   superscript    360      180  L     π  R                2  π     L  R        180^{\circ}<\Theta<360^{\circ}\,,\,\,\Theta=\left(360-\frac{180L}{\pi R}\right%
