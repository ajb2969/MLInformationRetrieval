   Brieskorn manifold      Brieskorn manifold   In mathematics, a Brieskorn manifold or Brieskorn–Phạm manifold , introduced by , is the intersection of a small sphere around the origin with the singular hypersurface        x  1   k  1    +  ⋯  +   x  n   k  n     =  0         superscript   subscript  x  1    subscript  k  1    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  x  n    subscript  k  n     0    x_{1}^{k_{1}}+\cdots+x_{n}^{k_{n}}=0   studied by .  Brieskorn manifolds give examples of exotic spheres .  References      This book describes Brieskorn's work relating exotic spheres to singularities of complex manifolds.
