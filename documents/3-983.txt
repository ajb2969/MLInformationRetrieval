   Cube (algebra)      Cube (algebra)   In arithmetic and algebra , the cube of a number   n   n   n   is its third power : the result of the number multiplied by itself twice:   .   It is also the number multiplied by its square :   .   This is also the volume formula for a geometric cube with sides of length   n   n   n   , giving rise to the name. The inverse operation of finding a number whose cube is   n   n   n   is called extracting the cube root of   n   n   n   . It determines the side of the cube of a given volume. It is also   n   n   n   raised to the one-third power.  Both cube and cube root are odd functions :   .   The cube of a number or any other mathematical expression is denoted by a superscript 3, for example 2 3 = 8 or .  In integers  A cube number , or a perfect cube , or sometimes just a cube , is a number which is the cube of an integer . The positive perfect cubes up to 60 3 are :      1 3 = 1   11 3 = 1331   21 3 = 9261   31 3 = 29,791   41 3 = 68,921   51 3 = 132,651     2 3 = 8   12 3 = 1728   22 3 = 10,648   32 3 = 32,768   42 3 = 74,088   52 3 = 140,608     3 3 = 27   13 3 = 2197   23 3 = 12,167   33 3 = 35,937   43 3 = 79,507   53 3 = 148,877     4 3 = 64   14 3 = 2744   24 3 = 13,824   34 3 = 39,304   44 3 = 85,184   54 3 = 157,464     5 3 = 125   15 3 = 3375   25 3 = 15,625   35 3 = 42,875   45 3 = 91,125   55 3 = 166,375     6 3 = 216   16 3 = 4096   26 3 = 17,576   36 3 = 46,656   46 3 = 97,336   56 3 = 175,616     7 3 = 343   17 3 = 4913   27 3 = 19,683   37 3 = 50,653   47 3 = 103,823   57 3 = 185,193     8 3 = 512   18 3 = 5832   28 3 = 21,952   38 3 = 54,872   48 3 = 110,592   58 3 = 195,112     9 3 = 729   19 3 = 6859   29 3 = 24,389   39 3 = 59,319   49 3 = 117,649   59 3 = 205,379     10 3 = 1000   20 3 = 8000   30 3 = 27,000   40 3 = 64,000   50 3 = 125,000   60 3 = 216,000     Geometrically speaking, a positive number   m   m   m   is a perfect cube if and only if one can arrange   m   m   m   solid unit cubes into a larger, solid cube. For example, 27 small cubes can be arranged into one larger one with the appearance of a Rubik's Cube , since 3 × 3 × 3 = 27.  The difference between the cubes of consecutive integers can be expressed as follows:   .   or   .   There is no smallest perfect cube, since the cube of a negative integer is negative. For example, (−4) × (−4) × (−4) = −64.  Base ten  Unlike perfect squares , perfect cubes do not have a small number of possibilities for the last two digits. Except for cubes divisible by 5, where only 25 , 75 and 00 can be the last two digits, any pair of digits with the last digit odd can be a perfect cube. With even cubes, there is considerable restriction, for only 00 , ''o 2 , e 4 , o 6 ' and e 8''' can be the last two digits of a perfect cube (where o stands for any odd digit and e for any even digit). Some cube numbers are also square numbers; for example, 64 is a square number (8 × 8) and a cube number (4 × 4 × 4). This happens if and only if the number is a perfect sixth power.  The last digits of each 3rd power are:      | 0   1   8   7   4   5   6   3   2   9      It is, however, easy to show that most numbers are not perfect cubes because all perfect cubes must have digital root  1 , 8 or 9 . Moreover, the digital root of any number's cube can be determined by the remainder the number gives when divided by 3:   If the number is divisible by 3, its cube has digital root 9;  If it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, its cube has digital root 1;  If it has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, its cube has digital root 8.   Waring's problem for cubes  Every positive integer can be written as the sum of nine (or fewer) positive cubes. This upper limit of nine cubes cannot be reduced because, for example, 23 cannot be written as the sum of fewer than nine positive cubes:   23 = 2 3 + 2 3 + 1 3 + 1 3 + 1 3 + 1 3 + 1 3 + 1 3 + 1 3 .   Fermat's last theorem for cubes  The equation has no non-trivial (i.e.    x  y  z  ≠  0      x  y  z  normal-≠  0    xyz≠0   ) solutions in integers. In fact, it has none in Eisenstein integers . 1  Both of these statements are also true for the equation 2  .  Sum of first n cubes  The sum of the first   n   n   n   cubes is the   n   n   n   th triangle number squared:         1  3   +   2  3   +  …  +   n  3    =    (   1  +  2  +  …  +  n   )   2   =    (    n   (   n  +  1   )    2   )   2    .           superscript  1  3    superscript  2  3   normal-…   superscript  n  3     superscript    1  2  normal-…  n   2         superscript      n    n  1    2   2      1^{3}+2^{3}+\dots+n^{3}=(1+2+\dots+n)^{2}=\left(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\right)^{2}.     For example, the sum of the first 5 cubes is the square of the 5th triangular number,        1  3   +   2  3   +   3  3   +   4  3   +   5  3    =    15  2           superscript  1  3    superscript  2  3    superscript  3  3    superscript  4  3    superscript  5  3     superscript  15  2     1^{3}+2^{3}+3^{3}+4^{3}+5^{3}=15^{2}\,     A similar result can be given for the sum of the first   y   y   y    odd cubes,        1  3   +   3  3   +  …  +    (    2  y   -  1   )   3    =    (   x  y   )   2          superscript  1  3    superscript  3  3   normal-…   superscript      2  y   1   3     superscript    x  y   2     1^{3}+3^{3}+\dots+(2y-1)^{3}=(xy)^{2}     but   x   x   x   ,   y   y   y   must satisfy the negative Pell equation       x  2   -   2   y  2     =   -  1          superscript  x  2     2   superscript  y  2       1     x^{2}-2y^{2}=-1   . For example, for    y  =  5      y  5    y=5   and   29   29   29   , then,        1  3   +   3  3   +  …  +   9  3    =     (   7  ⋅  5   )   2           superscript  1  3    superscript  3  3   normal-…   superscript  9  3     superscript   normal-⋅  7  5   2     1^{3}+3^{3}+\dots+9^{3}=(7\cdot 5)^{2}\,           1  3   +   3  3   +  …  +   57  3    =    (   41  ⋅  29   )   2          superscript  1  3    superscript  3  3   normal-…   superscript  57  3     superscript   normal-⋅  41  29   2     1^{3}+3^{3}+\dots+57^{3}=(41\cdot 29)^{2}     and so on. Also, every even  perfect number , except the first one, is the sum of the first odd cubes,      28  =    2  2    (    2  3   -  1   )    =    1  3   +   3  3          28     superscript  2  2      superscript  2  3   1            superscript  1  3    superscript  3  3       28=2^{2}(2^{3}-1)=1^{3}+3^{3}         496  =    2  4    (    2  5   -  1   )    =    1  3   +   3  3   +   5  3   +   7  3          496     superscript  2  4      superscript  2  5   1            superscript  1  3    superscript  3  3    superscript  5  3    superscript  7  3       496=2^{4}(2^{5}-1)=1^{3}+3^{3}+5^{3}+7^{3}         8128  =    2  6    (    2  7   -  1   )    =    1  3   +   3  3   +   5  3   +   7  3   +   9  3   +   11  3   +   13  3   +   15  3          8128     superscript  2  6      superscript  2  7   1            superscript  1  3    superscript  3  3    superscript  5  3    superscript  7  3    superscript  9  3    superscript  11  3    superscript  13  3    superscript  15  3       8128=2^{6}(2^{7}-1)=1^{3}+3^{3}+5^{3}+7^{3}+9^{3}+11^{3}+13^{3}+15^{3}     Sum of cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression  There are examples of cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression whose sum is a cube:        3  3   +   4  3   +   5  3    =   6  3          superscript  3  3    superscript  4  3    superscript  5  3     superscript  6  3     3^{3}+4^{3}+5^{3}=6^{3}           11  3   +   12  3   +   13  3   +   14  3    =   20  3          superscript  11  3    superscript  12  3    superscript  13  3    superscript  14  3     superscript  20  3     11^{3}+12^{3}+13^{3}+14^{3}=20^{3}           31  3   +   33  3   +   35  3   +   37  3   +   39  3   +   41  3    =   66  3          superscript  31  3    superscript  33  3    superscript  35  3    superscript  37  3    superscript  39  3    superscript  41  3     superscript  66  3     31^{3}+33^{3}+35^{3}+37^{3}+39^{3}+41^{3}=66^{3}     with the first one also known as Plato's number .

In rational numbers  Every positive rational number is the sum of three positive rational cubes, 4 and there are rationals that are not the sum of two rational cubes. 5  In real numbers, other fields, and rings  In real numbers , the cube function preserves the order: larger numbers have larger cubes. In other words, cubes (strictly) monotonically increase . Also, its codomain is the entire real line : the function is a surjection (takes all possible values). Only three numbers equal to the own cubes: , , and . If   p   p   p     Volumes of similar Euclidean solids are related as cubes of their linear sizes.  In complex numbers , the cube of a purely imaginary number is also purely imaginary. For example, .  The derivative of equals to .  Cubes occasionally have the surjective property in other fields , such as in for such prime   n   n   n   that   n   n   n   , 6 but not necessarily: see the counterexample with rationals above . Also in only three elements 0, ±1 are perfect cubes, of seven total. −1, 0, and 1 are perfect cubes anywhere and the only elements of a field equal to the own cubes: .  History  Determination of the cubes of large numbers was very common in many ancient civilizations . Mesopotamian mathematicians created cuneiform tablets with tables for calculating cubes and cube roots by the Old Babylonian period (20th to 16th centuries BC). 7 8 Cubic equations were known to the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus . 9  Hero of Alexandria devised a method for calculating cube roots in the 1st century CE. 10 Methods for solving cubic equations and extracting cube roots appear in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art , a Chinese mathematical text compiled around the 2nd century BCE and commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century CE. 11 The Indian mathematician Aryabhata wrote an explanation of cubes in his work Aryabhatiya . In 2010 Alberto Zanoni found a new algorithm 12 to compute the cube of a long integer in a certain range, faster than squaring-and-multiplying.
