Cube (algebra)

 In arithmetic and algebra, the cube of a number 
 
 
 
  is its third power: the result of the number multiplied by itself twice:

.
 

It is also the number multiplied by its square:

.
 

This is also the volume formula for a geometric cube with sides of length 
 
 
 
 , giving rise to the name. The inverse operation of finding a number whose cube is 
 
 
 
  is called extracting the cube root of 
 
 
 
 . It determines the side of the cube of a given volume. It is also 
 
 
 
  raised to the one-third power.
Both cube and cube root are odd functions:

.
 

The cube of a number or any other mathematical expression is denoted by a superscript 3, for example 23 = 8 or .
In integers
A cube number, or a perfect cube, or sometimes just a cube, is a number which is the cube of an integer. The positive perfect cubes up to 603 are :

Geometrically speaking, a positive number 
 
 
 
  is a perfect cube if and only if one can arrange 
 
 
 
  solid unit cubes into a larger, solid cube. For example, 27 small cubes can be arranged into one larger one with the appearance of a Rubik's Cube, since 3 × 3 × 3 = 27.
The difference between the cubes of consecutive integers can be expressed as follows:

.
 

or

.
 

There is no smallest perfect cube, since the cube of a negative integer is negative. For example, (−4) × (−4) × (−4) = −64.
Base ten
Unlike perfect squares, perfect cubes do not have a small number of possibilities for the last two digits. Except for cubes divisible by 5, where only 25, 75 and 00 can be the last two digits, any pair of digits with the last digit odd can be a perfect cube. With even cubes, there is considerable restriction, for only 00, ''o2, e4, o6' and e8''' can be the last two digits of a perfect cube (where o stands for any odd digit and e for any even digit). Some cube numbers are also square numbers; for example, 64 is a square number (8 × 8) and a cube number (4 × 4 × 4). This happens if and only if the number is a perfect sixth power.
The last digits of each 3rd power are:




| 0

1

8

7

4

5

6

3

2

9




It is, however, easy to show that most numbers are not perfect cubes because all perfect cubes must have digital root 1, 8 or 9. Moreover, the digital root of any number's cube can be determined by the remainder the number gives when divided by 3:

If the number is divisible by 3, its cube has digital root 9;
If it has a remainder of 1 when divided by 3, its cube has digital root 1;
If it has a remainder of 2 when divided by 3, its cube has digital root 8.

Waring's problem for cubes
Every positive integer can be written as the sum of nine (or fewer) positive cubes. This upper limit of nine cubes cannot be reduced because, for example, 23 cannot be written as the sum of fewer than nine positive cubes:

23 = 23 + 23 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13 + 13.
 

Fermat's last theorem for cubes
The equation  has no non-trivial (i.e. 
 
 
 
 ) solutions in integers. In fact, it has none in Eisenstein integers.1
Both of these statements are also true for the equation2 .
Sum of first n cubes
The sum of the first 
 
 
 
  cubes is the 
 
 
 
 th triangle number squared:



For example, the sum of the first 5 cubes is the square of the 5th triangular number,



A similar result can be given for the sum of the first 
 
 
odd cubes,



but 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  must satisfy the negative Pell equation

 
 . For example, for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then,






and so on. Also, every even perfect number, except the first one, is the sum of the first  odd cubes,









Sum of cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression
There are examples of cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression whose sum is a cube:









with the first one also known as Plato's number. The formula 
 
 
 
  for finding the sum of 
 
 
 
  cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression with common difference 
 
 
 
  and initial cube ,



is given by



A parametric solution to



is known for the special case of 
 
 
 
 , or consecutive cubes, but only sporadic solutions are known for integer 
 
 
 
 , such as 
 
 
 
  = 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 37, 39, etc.3
Cubes as sums of successive odd integers
In the sequence of odd integers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, ..., the first one is a cube (1 = 13); the sum of the next two is the next cube (3+5 = 23); the sum of the next three is the next cube (7+9+11 = 33); and so forth.
In rational numbers
Every positive rational number is the sum of three positive rational cubes,4 and there are rationals that are not the sum of two rational cubes.5
In real numbers, other fields, and rings
 In real numbers, the cube function preserves the order: larger numbers have larger cubes. In other words, cubes (strictly) monotonically increase. Also, its codomain is the entire real line: the function  is a surjection (takes all possible values). Only three numbers equal to the own cubes: , , and . If 
 
 

Volumes of similar Euclidean solids are related as cubes of their linear sizes.
In complex numbers, the cube of a purely imaginary number is also purely imaginary. For example, .
The derivative of  equals to .
Cubes occasionally have the surjective property in other fields, such as in  for such prime 
 
 
 
  that 
 
 
 
 ,6 but not necessarily: see the counterexample with rationals above. Also in  only three elements 0, ±1 are perfect cubes, of seven total. −1, 0, and 1 are perfect cubes anywhere and the only elements of a field equal to the own cubes: .
History
Determination of the cubes of large numbers was very common in many ancient civilizations. Mesopotamian mathematicians created cuneiform tablets with tables for calculating cubes and cube roots by the Old Babylonian period (20th to 16th centuries BC).78 Cubic equations were known to the ancient Greek mathematician Diophantus.9 Hero of Alexandria devised a method for calculating cube roots in the 1st century CE.10 Methods for solving cubic equations and extracting cube roots appear in The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, a Chinese mathematical text compiled around the 2nd century BCE and commented on by Liu Hui in the 3rd century CE.11 The Indian mathematician Aryabhata wrote an explanation of cubes in his work Aryabhatiya. In 2010 Alberto Zanoni found a new algorithm12 to compute the cube of a long integer in a certain range, faster than squaring-and-multiplying.
