Subordinator (mathematics)

In the mathematics of probability, a subordinator is a concept related to stochastic processes. A subordinator is itself a stochastic process of the evolution of time within another stochastic process, the subordinated stochastic process. In other words, a subordinator will determine the random number of "time steps" that occur within the subordinated process for a given unit of chronological time.
In order to be a subordinator a process must be a Lévy process.1 It also must be increasing, almost surely.2
Examples
The variance gamma process can be described as a Brownian motion subject to a gamma subordinator.3 If a Brownian motion, 
 
 
 
 , with drift 
 
 
 
  is subjected to a random time change which follows a gamma process, 
 
 
 
 , the variance gamma process will follow:



The Cauchy process can be described as a Brownian motion subject to a Lévy subordinator.4
