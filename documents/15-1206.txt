   Subordinator (mathematics)      Subordinator (mathematics)   In the mathematics of probability , a subordinator is a concept related to stochastic processes . A subordinator is itself a stochastic process of the evolution of time within another stochastic process, the subordinated stochastic process. In other words, a subordinator will determine the random number of "time steps" that occur within the subordinated process for a given unit of chronological time.  In order to be a subordinator a process must be a Lévy process . 1 It also must be increasing, almost surely . 2  Examples  The variance gamma process can be described as a Brownian motion subject to a gamma subordinator . 3 If a Brownian motion ,    W   (  t  )       W  t    W(t)   , with drift    θ  t      θ  t    \theta t   is subjected to a random time change which follows a gamma process ,    Γ   (  t  ;  1  ,  ν  )       normal-Γ   t  1  ν     \Gamma(t;1,\nu)   , the variance gamma process will follow:         X   V  G     (  t  ;  σ  ,  ν  ,  θ  )    :=     θ   Γ   (  t  ;  1  ,  ν  )    +    σ   W   (   Γ   (  t  ;  1  ,  ν  )    )      .     assign     superscript  X    V  G     t  σ  ν  θ        θ  normal-Γ   t  1  ν      σ  W    normal-Γ   t  1  ν        X^{VG}(t;\sigma,\nu,\theta)\;:=\;\theta\,\Gamma(t;1,\nu)+\sigma\,W(\Gamma(t;1,%
 \nu)).     The Cauchy process can be described as a Brownian motion subject to a Lévy subordinator . 4  References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩
