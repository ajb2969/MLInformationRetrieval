   Incidence coloring      Incidence coloring   In graph theory , coloring generally implies assignment of labels to vertices, edges or faces in a graph . The incidence coloring is a special graph labeling where in each incidence of an edge with a vertex is assigned a color under certain constraints.  Definitions  Let G = (V, E) be a simple graph with vertex set (non-empty) V and edge set E. An incidence is defined as a pair (v, e) where v ϵ V(G) is an end point of e ϵ E(G). In simple words, we say that vertex v is incident to edge e. Consider a set of incidences, say, I(G) = {(v,e) : v ϵ V(G) and e ϵ E(G) and v ϵ e}. 1 The two incidences (v,e) and (u,f) are said to be adjacent if one of the given conditions holds: (i) v = u, e ≠ f, (ii) e = f, v ≠ u, (iii) e = {v, u}, f = {u, w} and v ≠ w.  An incidence coloring of G can be defined as a function c: I(G) → N such that c((v, e)) ≠ c((u,f)) for any incidences (v, e) and (u, f) that are adjacent. This implies that incidence coloring assigns distinct colors to neighborly incidences. [Generally, a simplified notation c(v, u) is used instead of c((v, e)).] The minimum number of colors needed for incidence coloring of a graph is known as incidence chromatic number or incidence coloring number of G, represented by    χ  i     subscript  χ  i    \chi_{i}   (G). This notation was introduced by Jennifer J. Quinn Massey and Richard A. Brualdi in 1993.  Let A be a finite subset of N, the set of natural numbers. A is an interval iff it contains all the numbers between minimum of A and maximum of A. Consider c to be an incidence coloring of graph G. Let    A  c     subscript  A  c    A_{c}   (v) = {c(v,e) : v is an end point of edge e where e belongs to edge set E}. An interval incidence coloring of G is an incidence coloring c of graph G such that for each vertex v in V(G), the set    A  c     subscript  A  c    A_{c}   (v) is an interval. 2  The interval incidence coloring number of G is the minimum number of colors used for the interval incidence coloring of G. It is denoted by IIC(G). If only IIC(G) colors are used for the interval incidence coloring, then it is said to be minimal.  History  The concept of incidence coloring was introduced by Brualdi and Massey in 1993. They bounded it in terms of Δ(G), the maximum degree of a graph G. Initially, the incidence chromatic number of trees, complete bipartite graphs and complete graphs was found out. They also conjectured that all graphs can have an incidence coloring using Δ(G) + 2 colors (Incidence coloring conjecture - ICC). This conjecture was disproved by Guiduli, who showed that incidence coloring concept is a directed star arboricity case, 3 introduced by Alon and Algor. His counter example showed that incidence chromatic number is at most Δ(G) + O(log Δ(G)). 4  Chen et al. found the incidence chromatic number of paths , fans, cycles , wheels, complete tripartite graph and adding edge wheels. Few years later, Shiu et al. showed that this conjecture is true for certain cubic graphs such as cubic Hamiltonian graphs. He showed that in case of outerplanar graph of maximum degree 4, the incidence chromatic number is not 5. The bounds for incidence chromatic number of various graph classes is found out now.  Basic Results  Consider a graph G with maximum degree Δ(G).   The trivial lower bound for    χ  i     subscript  χ  i    \chi_{i}   (G) is given as    χ  i     subscript  χ  i    \chi_{i}   (G) ≥ Δ(G) + 1. The bound is attained by trees and complete graphs.      χ  i     subscript  χ  i    \chi_{i}   (G) = n when G =    K  n     subscript  K  n    K_{n}   (G) with n ≥ 2.  Let G be a tree of order n where n ≥ 2. Then,    χ  i     subscript  χ  i    \chi_{i}   (G) = Δ(G) + 1.  For a complete bipartite graph     K   m  ,  n      subscript  K   m  n     K_{m,n}   with m ≥ n ≥ 2, incidence chromatic number is m + 2.  For any graph G,    χ  i     subscript  χ  i    \chi_{i}   (G) ≤ 2Δ(G).   All these results were determined and proved by Brualdi and Massey(1993). Shiu, Sun and Wu have proposed certain necessary conditions for graph to meet the quality    χ  i     subscript  χ  i    \chi_{i}   (G) = Δ(G) + 1.  Incidence Coloring of some graph classes  Incidence coloring of meshes  Several algorithms are introduced to provide incidence coloring of meshes 5 like square meshes , honeycomb meshes and hexagonal meshes. These algorithms are optimal. For each mesh, the incidence colors can be made in the linear time with the least number of colors. It is found out that Δ(G) + 1 colors are required for incidence coloring of square meshes, honeycomb meshes and hexagonal meshes.   The incidence chromatic number of a square mesh is 5.  The incidence chromatic number of a hexagonal mesh is 7.  The incidence chromatic number of a honeycomb mesh is 4.   Incidence coloring of Halin graphs  For a Halin graph G with maximum degree greater than 4, the incidence chromatic number is Δ(G) + 1; which was proved by Chen, Wang and Pang. In case of Halin graphs with Δ(G) = 3 or 4, Jing-Zhe Qu determined that the incidence chromatic number to be 5 or 6 respectively. If Halin graph G contains a tree T, then incidence chromatic number of    H  2     superscript  H  2    H^{2}   is at most Δ(    T  2     superscript  T  2    T^{2}   ) + Δ(T) + 8. 6 Every cubic Halin graph other than complete graph on 4 vertices satisfies incidence coloring with Δ + 2 colors (Result proved by Shiu and Sun). Su, Meng and Guo extended this result and showed that all pseudo-Halin graphs satisfy incidence coloring conjecture. However, when the incidence coloring number of Halin graphs with low degree is Δ(G) + 1 colors is still an unsolved problem.  Incidence coloring of outerplanar graphs  Consider an outerplanar graph G. Let vertex v in G be a cut vertex such that G – v is union of graphs    H  1     subscript  H  1    H_{1}   and    H  2     subscript  H  2    H_{2}   . Let graph    G  1     subscript  G  1    G_{1}   be the induced subgraph on vertex v and vertices of    H  1     subscript  H  1    H_{1}   ; and graph    G  2     subscript  G  2    G_{2}   be the induced subgraph on vertex v and vertices of    H  2     subscript  H  2    H_{2}   . Then incidence chromatic number of G is maximum among incidence chromatic number of     G  1   ,   G  2       subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2     G_{1},G_{2}   and 1 +    d  G     subscript  d  G    d_{G}   (v) where    d  G     subscript  d  G    d_{G}   (v) is the degree of vertex v in G.  The incidence chromatic number of an outerplanar graph G is at most Δ(G) + 2 where Δ(G) is maximum degree of G. In case of outerplanar graphs with Δ(G) greater than 3, the incidence chromatic number is Δ(G) +1.  With the use of techniques such as exchange of colors, double inductions, etc., it is found out that for every outerplanar graph, there exists a (Δ + 2, 2) – incidence coloring. 7 The solution for incidence chromatic number of the outerplanar graph G having Δ(G) = 3 and 2-connected outerplanar graph is still an open question.  Incidence coloring of k-degenerated graphs  There are several graph classes for which incidence chromatic number is bounded by maximum degree plus some fixed constant.   Incidence chromatic number of a cubic graph G is at most ∆(G)+2.  Incidence chromatic number of k-degenerated graphs G is at most ∆(G)+2k-1.  Incidence chromatic number of k 4 minor free graphs G is at most ∆(G)+2 and it form a tight bound.  Incidence chromatic number of a planar graph G is at most ∆(G)+7.
