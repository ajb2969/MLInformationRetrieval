Fejér kernel

In mathematics, the Fejér kernel is a summability kernel used to express the effect of Cesàro summation on Fourier series. It is a non-negative kernel, giving rise to an approximate identity. It is named after the Hungarian mathematician Lipót Fejér (1880–1959). 
Definition
The Fejér kernel is defined as



where


 
  is the kth order Dirichlet kernel. It can also be written in a closed form as


 
 ,
where this expression is defined.1
The Fejér kernel can also be expressed as


 
 .
Properties
The Fejér kernel is a positive summability kernel. An important property of the Fejér kernel is 
 
 
 
  with average value of 
 
 
 
 .
Convolution
The convolution Fn is positive: for 
 
 
 
  of period 
 
 
 
  it satisfies



Since 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 , which is Cesàro summation of Fourier series.
By Young's inequality,


 
  for every 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 .
Additionally, if 
 
 
 
 , then


a.e. Since 
 
 
 
  is finite, 
 
 
 
 , so the result holds for other 
 
 
 
  spaces, 
 
 
 
  as well.
If 
 
 
 
  is continuous, then the convergence is uniform, yielding a proof of the Weierstrass theorem.

One consequence of the pointwise a.e. convergence is the uniquess of Fourier coefficients: If 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  a.e. This follows from writing 
 
 
 
 , which depends only on the Fourier coefficients.
A second consequence is that if 
 
 
 
  exists a.e., then 
 
 
 
  a.e., since Cesàro means 
 
 
 
  converge to the original sequence limit if it exists.
