Hermitian wavelet

Hermitian wavelets are a family of continuous wavelets, used in the continuous wavelet transform. The 
 
 
 
  Hermitian wavelet is defined as the 
 
 
 
  derivative of a Gaussian distribution:



where 
 
 
 
 
  denotes the 
 
 
Hermite polynomial.
The normalisation coefficient 
 
 
 
  is given by:



The prefactor 
 
 
 
  in the resolution of the identity of the continuous wavelet transform for this wavelet is given by:



i.e. Hermitian wavelets are admissible for all positive 
 
 
 
 .
In computer vision and image processing, Gaussian derivative operators of different orders are frequently used as a basis for expressing various types of visual operations; see scale space and N-jet.
Examples of Hermitian wavelets: Starting from a Gaussian function with 
 
 
 
 :



the first 3 derivatives read



and their 
 
 
 
  norms 
 
 

So the wavelets which are the negative normalized derivatives are:
