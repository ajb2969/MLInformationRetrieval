The centered pentagonal number for n is given by the formula         5   n  2    +   5  n   +  2   2   .          5   superscript  n  2      5  n   2   2    {{5n^{2}+5n+2}\over 2}.     The first few centered pentagonal numbers are  1 , 6 , 16 , 31 , 51 , 76 , 106 , 141 , 181 , 226 , 276, 331, 391, 456, 526, 601, 681, 766, 856, 951, 1051, 1156, 1266, 1381, 1501, 1626, 1756, 1891, 2031, 2176, 2326, 2481, 2641, 2806, 2976 .  The parity of centered pentagonal numbers follows the pattern even-even-odd-odd, and in base 10 the units follow the pattern 6-6-1-1.
