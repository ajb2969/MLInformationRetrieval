   Special affine group      Special affine group   In the mathematical study of transformation groups , the special affine group is the group of affine transformations of a fixed affine space which preserve volume . This is the affine analogue of the special linear group .  On R n , every special affine transformation has the form      𝐱  ↦    A  𝐱   +  𝐛      maps-to  𝐱      A  𝐱   𝐛     \mathbf{x}\mapsto A\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{b}     where A is an n × n  matrix of determinant one, and b is a fixed vector in R n . The special affine group is a subgroup of the affine group .  "  Category:Lie groups
