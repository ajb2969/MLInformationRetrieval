   Local zeta-function      Local zeta-function   Suppose that V is a non-singular  n -dimensional projective algebraic variety over the field F q with q elements. In number theory , the local zeta function  Z ( V , s ) of V (sometimes called the congruent zeta function ) is defined as       Z   (  V  ,  s  )    =   exp   (    ∑   m  =  1   ∞      N  m   m     (   q   -  s    )   m     )          Z   V  s        superscript   subscript     m  1           subscript  N  m   m    superscript   superscript  q    s    m        Z(V,s)=\exp\left(\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}\frac{N_{m}}{m}(q^{-s})^{m}\right)     where N m is the number of points of V defined over the degree m extension F q m of F q . By the variable transformation    u  =   q   -  s        u   superscript  q    s      u=q^{-s}   , then it is defined by       Z   (  V  ,  u  )    =   exp   (    ∑   m  =  1   ∞     N  m     u  m   m     )          Z   V  u        superscript   subscript     m  1         subscript  N  m      superscript  u  m   m        \mathit{Z}(V,u)=\exp\left(\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}N_{m}\frac{u^{m}}{m}\right)     as the formal power series of the variable u .  Equivalently, sometimes it is defined as follows:        (  1  )    Z   (  V  ,  0  )     =   1        1    Z   V  0     1    (1)\ \ \mathit{Z}(V,0)=1\,            (  2  )     d   d  u     log  Z    (  V  ,  u  )     =    ∑   m  =  1   ∞     N  m     u   m  -  1        .       2      d    d  u      Z    V  u       superscript   subscript     m  1         subscript  N  m    superscript  u    m  1        (2)\ \ \frac{d}{du}\log\mathit{Z}(V,u)=\sum_{m=1}^{\infty}N_{m}u^{m-1}\ .     In other word, the local zeta function Z(V,u) with coefficients in the finite field  F is defined as a function whose logarithmic derivative generates the numbers N m of the solutions of equation, defining V , in the m degree extension F m .  Formulation  Given F , there is, up to isomorphism , just one field F k with       [   F  k   :  F  ]   =   k      fragments   fragments  normal-[   subscript  F  k   normal-:  F  normal-]    k    [F_{k}:F]=k\,   ,  for k = 1, 2, ... . Given a set of polynomial equations — or an algebraic variety  V — defined over F , we can count the number       N  k      subscript  N  k    N_{k}\,     of solutions in F k and create the generating function       G   (  t  )    =     N  1   t   +     N  2    t  2    /  2   +     N  3    t  3    /  3   +   ⋯          G  t        subscript  N  1   t        subscript  N  2    superscript  t  2    2        subscript  N  3    superscript  t  3    3   normal-⋯     G(t)=N_{1}t+N_{2}t^{2}/2+N_{3}t^{3}/3+\cdots\,   .  The correct definition for Z ( t ) is to make log Z equal to G , and so      Z  =   exp   (   G   (  t  )    )        Z      G  t      Z=\exp(G(t))\,     we will have Z (0) = 1 since G (0) = 0, and Z ( t ) is a priori a formal power series .  Note that the logarithmic derivative         Z  ′    (  t  )    /  Z    (  t  )            superscript  Z  normal-′   t   Z   t    Z^{\prime}(t)/Z(t)\,     equals the generating function        G  ′    (  t  )    =    N  1   +    N  2    t  1    +    N  3    t  2    +   ⋯           superscript  G  normal-′   t      subscript  N  1      subscript  N  2    superscript  t  1       subscript  N  3    superscript  t  2    normal-⋯     G^{\prime}(t)=N_{1}+N_{2}t^{1}+N_{3}t^{2}+\cdots\,   .  Examples  For example, assume all the N k are 1; this happens for example if we start with an equation like X = 0, so that geometrically we are taking V a point. Then       G   (  t  )    =   -   log   (   1  -  t   )           G  t         1  t       G(t)=-\log(1-t)     is the expansion of a logarithm (for | t | Z(t) = \frac{1}{(1 - t)}\ .  To take something more interesting, let V be the projective line over F . If F has q elements, then this has q + 1 points, including as we must the one point at infinity . Therefore we shall have       N  k   =    q  k   +  1        subscript  N  k      superscript  q  k   1     N_{k}=q^{k}+1     and       G   (  t  )    =    -   log   (   1  -  t   )     -   log   (   1  -   q  t    )           G  t           1  t         1    q  t        G(t)=-\log(1-t)-\log(1-qt)     for | t | small enough.  In this case we have        Z   (  t  )    =    1    (   1  -  t   )    (   1  -   q  t    )       .        Z  t     1      1  t     1    q  t        Z(t)=\frac{1}{(1-t)(1-qt)}\ .     The first study of these functions was in the 1923 dissertation of Emil Artin . He obtained results for the case of hyperelliptic curve , and conjectured the further main points of the theory as applied to curves. The theory was then developed by F. K. Schmidt and Helmut Hasse . 1 The earliest known non-trivial cases of local zeta-functions were implicit in Carl Friedrich Gauss 's Disquisitiones Arithmeticae , article 358; there certain particular examples of elliptic curves over finite fields having complex multiplication have their points counted by means of cyclotomy . 2  For the definition and some examples, see also. 3  Motivations  The relationship between the definitions of G and Z can be explained in a number of ways. (See for example the infinite product formula for Z below.) In practice it makes Z a rational function of t , something that is interesting even in the case of V an elliptic curve over finite field.  It is the functions Z that are designed to multiply, to get global zeta functions . Those involve different finite fields (for example the whole family of fields Z / p Z as p runs over all prime numbers ). In that connection, the variable t undergoes substitution by p -s , where s is the complex variable traditionally used in Dirichlet series . (For details see Hasse-Weil zeta-function .)  With that understanding, the products of the Z in the two cases used as examples come out as    ζ   (  s  )       ζ  s    \zeta(s)   and    ζ   (  s  )   ζ   (   s  -  1   )       ζ  s  ζ    s  1     \zeta(s)\zeta(s-1)   .  Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields  For projective curves C over F that are non-singular , it can be shown that        Z   (  t  )    =     P   (  t  )      (   1  -  t   )    (   1  -   q  t    )       ,        Z  t       P  t       1  t     1    q  t        Z(t)=\frac{P(t)}{(1-t)(1-qt)}\ ,     with P ( t ) a polynomial, of degree 2 g where g is the genus of C . Rewriting        P   (  t  )    =    ∏   i  =  1    2  g     (   1  -    ω  i   u    )     ,        P  t     subscript   superscript  product    2  g      i  1      1     subscript  ω  i   u       P(t)=\prod^{2g}_{i=1}(1-\omega_{i}u)\ ,     the Riemann hypothesis for curves over finite fields states        |   ω  i   |   =    q   1  /  2      .         subscript  ω  i     superscript  q    1  2      |\omega_{i}|=q^{1/2}\ .     For example, for the elliptic curve case there are two roots, and it is easy to show the absolute values of the roots are q 1/2 . Hasse's theorem is that they have the same absolute value; and this has immediate consequences for the number of points.  André Weil proved this for the general case, around 1940 ( Comptes Rendus note, April 1940): he spent much time in the years after that writing up the algebraic geometry involved. This led him to the general Weil conjectures , Alexander Grothendieck developed the scheme theory for the sake of resolving it and finally, Pierre Deligne had proved a generation later. See étale cohomology for the basic formulae of the general theory.  General formulas for the zeta function  It is a consequence of the Lefschetz trace formula for the Frobenius morphism that      Z   (  X  ,  t  )   =   ∏   i  =  0    2   dim  X     det    (  1  -  t   Frob  q   |   H  c  i    (   X  ¯   ,   ℚ  ℓ   )   )     (   -  1   )    i  +  1     .     fragments  Z   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-,  t  normal-)     superscript   subscript  product    i  0      2   dimension  X       superscript   fragments  normal-(  1   t   subscript  Frob  q   normal-|   subscript   superscript  H  i   c    fragments  normal-(   normal-¯  X   normal-,   subscript  ℚ  normal-ℓ   normal-)   normal-)    superscript    1     i  1     normal-.    Z(X,t)=\prod_{i=0}^{2\dim X}\det\big(1-t\mbox{Frob}_{q}|H^{i}_{c}(\overline{X}%
 ,{\mathbb{Q}}_{\ell})\big)^{(-1)^{i+1}}.     Here   X   X   X   is a separated scheme of finite type over the finite field F with   q   q   q   elements, and Frob q is the geometric Frobenius acting on   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   -adic étale cohomology with compact supports of    X  ¯     normal-¯  X    \overline{X}   , the lift of   X   X   X   to the algebraic closure of the field F . This shows that the zeta function is a rational function of   t   t   t   .  An infinite product formula for    Z   (  X  ,  t  )       Z   X  t     Z(X,t)   is        Z   (  X  ,  t  )    =   ∏    (   1  -   t   deg   (  x  )      )    -  1      .        Z   X  t     product   superscript    1   superscript  t   degree  x       1       Z(X,t)=\prod\ (1-t^{\deg(x)})^{-1}.     Here, the product ranges over all closed points x of X and deg( x ) is the degree of x . The local zeta function Z(X, t) is viewed as a function of the complex variable s via the change of variables q -s .  In the case where X is the variety V discussed above, the closed points are the equivalence classes x=[P] of points P on    V  ¯     normal-¯  V    \overline{V}   , where two points are equivalent if they are conjugates over F . The degree of x is the degree of the field extension of F generated by the coordinates of P . The logarithmic derivative of the infinite product Z(X, t) is easily seen to be the generating function discussed above, namely       N  1   +    N  2    t  1    +    N  3    t  2    +   ⋯        subscript  N  1      subscript  N  2    superscript  t  1       subscript  N  3    superscript  t  2    normal-⋯    N_{1}+N_{2}t^{1}+N_{3}t^{2}+\cdots\,   .
