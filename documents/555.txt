   Sinapine esterase      Sinapine esterase   In enzymology , a sinapine esterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sinapoylcholine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sinapate + choline   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sinapoylcholine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are sinapate and choline .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sinapoylcholine sinapohydrolase . This enzyme is also called aromatic choline esterase . This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
