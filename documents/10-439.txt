KdV hierarchy

In mathematics, the KdV hierarchy is an infinite sequence of partial differential equations which starts with the Kortewegâ€“de Vries equation.
Let 
 
 
 
  be translation operator defined on real valued functions as 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be set of all analytic functions that satisfy 
 
 
 
 
 , i.e. periodic functions of period 1. For each 
 
 
 
 , define an operator 
 
 
 
  on the space of smooth functions on 
 
 
 
 . We define the Bloch spectrum

 
  to be the set of 
 
 
 
 
  such that there is a nonzero function 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The KdV hierarchy is a sequence of nonlinear differential operators 
 
 
 
  such that for any 
 
 
 
 
  we have an analytic function 
 
 
 
  and we define 
 
 
 
  to be 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 
  is independent of 
 
 
 
 .
