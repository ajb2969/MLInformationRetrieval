   KdV hierarchy      KdV hierarchy   In mathematics, the KdV hierarchy is an infinite sequence of partial differential equations which starts with the Korteweg–de Vries equation .  Let   T   T   T   be translation operator defined on real valued functions as     T   (  g  )    (  x  )    =   g   (   x  +  1   )          T  g  x     g    x  1      T(g)(x)=g(x+1)   . Let   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   be set of all analytic functions that satisfy     T   (  g  )    (  x  )    =   g   (  x  )          T  g  x     g  x     T(g)(x)=g(x)   , i.e. periodic functions of period 1. For each    g  ∈  𝒞      g  𝒞    g\in\mathcal{C}   , define an operator      L  g    (  ψ  )    (  x  )    =     ψ  ′′    (  x  )    +   g   (  x  )   ψ   (  x  )            subscript  L  g   ψ  x        superscript  ψ  ′′   x     g  x  ψ  x      L_{g}(\psi)(x)=\psi^{\prime\prime}(x)+g(x)\psi(x)   on the space of smooth functions on   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   . We define the Bloch spectrum     ℬ  g     subscript  ℬ  g    \mathcal{B}_{g}   to be the set of     (  λ  ,  α  )   ∈   ℂ  ×   ℂ  *         λ  α     ℂ   superscript  ℂ       (\lambda,\alpha)\in\mathbb{C}\times\mathbb{C}^{*}   such that there is a nonzero function   ψ   ψ   \psi   with      L  g    (  ψ  )    =   λ  ψ          subscript  L  g   ψ     λ  ψ     L_{g}(\psi)=\lambda\psi   and     T   (  ψ  )    =   α  ψ         T  ψ     α  ψ     T(\psi)=\alpha\psi   . The KdV hierarchy is a sequence of nonlinear differential operators     D  i   :   𝒞  →  𝒞      normal-:   subscript  D  i    normal-→  𝒞  𝒞     D_{i}:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{C}   such that for any   i   i   i   we have an analytic function    g   (  x  ,  t  )       g   x  t     g(x,t)   and we define     g  t    (  x  )        subscript  g  t   x    g_{t}(x)   to be    g   (  x  ,  t  )       g   x  t     g(x,t)   and      D  i    (   g  t   )    =    d   d  t     g  t           subscript  D  i    subscript  g  t        d    d  t     subscript  g  t      D_{i}(g_{t})=\frac{d}{dt}g_{t}   , then    ℬ  g     subscript  ℬ  g    \mathcal{B}_{g}   is independent of   t   t   t   .
