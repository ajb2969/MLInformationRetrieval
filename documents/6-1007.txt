   Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelet      Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelet   (Figure)  An example of the 2D wavelet transform that is used in JPEG2000   Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelet are the historically first family of biorthogonal wavelets , which was made popular by Ingrid Daubechies . 1 2 These are not the same as the orthogonal Daubechies wavelets , and also not very similar in shape and properties. However their construction idea is the same.  The JPEG 2000  compression standard uses the biorthogonal CDF 5/3 wavelet (also called the LeGall 5/3 wavelet ) for lossless compression and a CDF 9/7 wavelet for lossy compression .  Properties   The primal generator is a B-spline if the simple factorization      q  prim    (  X  )    =  1         subscript  q  prim   X   1    q_{\mathrm{prim}}(X)=1   (see below) is chosen  The dual generator has the maximum number of smoothness factors which is possible for its length.  All generators and wavelets in this family are symmetric.   Construction  For every positive integer A there exists a unique polynomial     Q  A    (  X  )        subscript  Q  A   X    Q_{A}(X)   of degree A − 1 satisfying the identity           (   1  -   X  2    )   A     Q  A    (  X  )    +      (   X  2   )   A     Q  A    (   2  -  X   )     =  1           superscript    1    X  2    A    subscript  Q  A   X      superscript    X  2   A    subscript  Q  A     2  X     1    \left(1-\frac{X}{2}\right)^{A}\,Q_{A}(X)+\left(\frac{X}{2}\right)^{A}\,Q_{A}(2%
 -X)=1   .  This is the same polynomial as used in the construction of the Daubechies wavelets . But, instead of a spectral factorization, here we try to factor        Q  A    (  X  )    =    q  prim    (  X  )    q  dual    (  X  )           subscript  Q  A   X      subscript  q  prim   X   subscript  q  dual   X     Q_{A}(X)=q_{\mathrm{prim}}(X)\,q_{\mathrm{dual}}(X)   ,  where the factors are polynomials with real coefficients and constant coefficient 1. Then,        a  prim    (  Z  )    =   2    Z  d       (    1  +  Z   2   )   A     q  prim    (   1  -    Z  +   Z   -  1     2    )           subscript  a  prim   Z     2   superscript  Z  d    superscript      1  Z   2   A    subscript  q  prim     1      Z   superscript  Z    1     2       a_{\mathrm{prim}}(Z)=2Z^{d}\,\left(\frac{1+Z}{2}\right)^{A}\,q_{\mathrm{prim}}%
 \left(1-\frac{Z+Z^{-1}}{2}\right)     and        a  dual    (  Z  )    =   2    Z  d       (    1  +  Z   2   )   A     q  dual    (   1  -    Z  +   Z   -  1     2    )           subscript  a  dual   Z     2   superscript  Z  d    superscript      1  Z   2   A    subscript  q  dual     1      Z   superscript  Z    1     2       a_{\mathrm{dual}}(Z)=2Z^{d}\,\left(\frac{1+Z}{2}\right)^{A}\,q_{\mathrm{dual}}%
 \left(1-\frac{Z+Z^{-1}}{2}\right)     form a biorthogonal pair of scaling sequences. d is some integer used to center the symmetric sequences at zero or to make the corresponding discrete filters causal.  Depending on the roots of     Q  A    (  X  )        subscript  Q  A   X    Q_{A}(X)   , there may be up to    2   A  -  1      superscript  2    A  1     2^{A-1}   different factorizations. A simple factorization is      q  prim    (  X  )    =  1         subscript  q  prim   X   1    q_{\mathrm{prim}}(X)=1   and      q  dual    (  X  )    =    Q  A    (  X  )           subscript  q  dual   X      subscript  Q  A   X     q_{\mathrm{dual}}(X)=Q_{A}(X)   , then the   primary   primary   \mathrm{primary}   scaling function is the B-spline of order A − 1 . For A = 1 one obtains the orthogonal Haar wavelet .  Tables of coefficients  For A=2 one obtains in this way the LeGall 5/3-wavelet :      A   Q A (X)   q prim (X)   q dual (X)   a prim (Z)   a dual (Z)       2       1  +  X      1  X    1+X      1       1  +  X      1  X    1+X           1  2      (   1  +  Z   )   2    Z        1  2    superscript    1  Z   2   Z    \frac{1}{2}(1+Z)^{2}\,Z           1  2      (   1  +  Z   )   2     (     -   1  2    +    2   Z    -     1  2     Z  2     )         1  2    superscript    1  Z   2           1  2      2  Z        1  2    superscript  Z  2       \frac{1}{2}(1+Z)^{2}\,\left(-\frac{1}{2}+2\,Z-\frac{1}{2}\,Z^{2}\right)         For A=4 one obtains the 9/7-CDF-wavelet . One gets      Q  4    (  X  )    =   1  +    2   X   +    5  /   2     X  2    +    5  /   2     X  3            subscript  Q  4   X     1    2  X       5  2    superscript  X  2        5  2    superscript  X  3       Q_{4}(X)=1+2\,X+5/2\,X^{2}+5/2\,X^{3}   , this polynomial has exactly one real root, thus it is the product of a linear factor    1  -    c   X       1    c  X     1-c\,X   and a quadratic factor. The coefficient c , which is the inverse of the root, has an approximate value of −1.4603482098.

Neither of this numbering is unique. The number of vanishing moments does not tell about the chosen factorization. A filterbank with filter sizes 7 and 9 can have 6 and 2 vanishing moments when using the trivial factorization, or 4 and 4 vanishing moments as it is the case for the JPEG 2000 wavelet. The same wavelet may therefore be referred to as "CDF 9/7" (based on the filter sizes) or "biorthogonal 4.4" (based on the vanishing moments).  Lifting decomposition  For the trivially factorized filterbanks a lifting decomposition can be explicitly given. 3  Even number of smoothness factors  Let   n   n   n   be the number of smoothness factors in the B-spline lowpass filter, which shall be even.  Then define recursively      a  0     subscript  a  0    \displaystyle a_{0}     The lifting filters are        s  m    (  z  )    =    a  m   ⋅   (    2  ⋅  m   +  1   )   ⋅   (   1  +   z    (   -  1   )   m     )           subscript  s  m   z    normal-⋅   subscript  a  m      normal-⋅  2  m   1     1   superscript  z   superscript    1   m        s_{m}(z)=a_{m}\cdot(2\cdot m+1)\cdot(1+z^{(-1)^{m}})     Conclusively the interim results of the lifting are       x   -  1     (  z  )        subscript  x    1    z    \displaystyle x_{-1}(z)     which leads to        x   n  /  2     (  z  )    =    2   -   n  /  2     ⋅    (   1  +  z   )   n   ⋅   z    n  /  2   mod   2  -   n  /  2              subscript  x    n  2    z    normal-⋅   superscript  2      n  2      superscript    1  z   n    superscript  z   modulo    n  2     2    n  2         x_{n/2}(z)=2^{-n/2}\cdot(1+z)^{n}\cdot z^{n/2\bmod 2-n/2}     The filters    x   n  /  2      subscript  x    n  2     x_{n/2}   and    x    n  /  2   -  1      subscript  x      n  2   1     x_{n/2-1}   constitute the CDF-n,0 filterbank.  Odd number of smoothness factors  Now, let   n   n   n   be odd.  Then define recursively      a  0     subscript  a  0    \displaystyle a_{0}     The lifting filters are        s  m    (  z  )    =     a  m   ⋅   (    (    2  ⋅  m   +  1   )   +    (    2  ⋅  m   -  1   )   ⋅  z    )    /   z   m  mod  2            subscript  s  m   z      normal-⋅   subscript  a  m        normal-⋅  2  m   1    normal-⋅     normal-⋅  2  m   1   z      superscript  z   modulo  m  2       s_{m}(z)=a_{m}\cdot((2\cdot m+1)+(2\cdot m-1)\cdot z)/z^{m\bmod 2}     Conclusively the interim results of the lifting are       x   -  1     (  z  )        subscript  x    1    z    \displaystyle x_{-1}(z)     which leads to        x    (   n  +  1   )   /  2     (  z  )    ∼    (   1  +  z   )   n      similar-to     subscript  x      n  1   2    z    superscript    1  z   n     x_{(n+1)/2}(z)\sim(1+z)^{n}   where we neglect the translation and the constant factor.  The filters    x    (   n  +  1   )   /  2      subscript  x      n  1   2     x_{(n+1)/2}   and    x    (   n  -  1   )   /  2      subscript  x      n  1   2     x_{(n-1)/2}   constitute the CDF-n,1 filterbank.  Applications  The Cohen-Daubechies-Feauveau wavelet and other biorthogonal wavelets have been used to compress fingerprint scans for the FBI. 4 A standard for compressing fingerprints in this way was developed by Tom Hopper (FBI), Jonathan Bradley (Los Alamos National Laboratory) and Chris Brislawn (Los Alamos National Laboratory). 5 By using wavelets, a compression ratio of around 20 to 1 can be achieved, meaning a 10MB image could be reduced to as little as 500KB while still passing recognition tests. 6  External links   JPEG 2000: How does it work?
