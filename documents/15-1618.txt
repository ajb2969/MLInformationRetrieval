   Nucleoside-triphosphate-hexose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase      Nucleoside-triphosphate-hexose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase   Nucleoside-triphosphate-aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase (, NDP hexose pyrophosphorylase , hexose 1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase , hexose nucleotidylating enzyme , nucleoside diphosphohexose pyrophosphorylase , hexose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase , GTP:alpha-D-hexose-1-phosphate guanylyltransferase , GDP hexose pyrophosphorylase , guanosine diphosphohexose pyrophosphorylase , NTP:hexose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name NTP:alpha-D-aldose-1-phosphate nucleotidyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   nucleoside triphosphate + alpha-D-aldose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    diphosphate + NDP-hexose   In decreasing order of activity, guanosine , inosine and adenosine diphosphate hexoses are substrates in the reverse reaction, with either glucose or mannose as the sugar.
