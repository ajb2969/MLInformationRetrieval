   Holeum      Holeum   Holeums are hypothetical stable, quantized gravitational bound states of primordial or micro black holes . Holeums were proposed by L.K. Chavda and Abhijit Chavda in 2002. 1 They have all the properties associated with cold dark matter . Holeums are not black holes , even though they are made up of black holes.  Properties  The binding energy     E  n     subscript  E  n    E_{n}   of a holeum that consists of two identical micro black holes of mass   m   m   m   is given by 2       E  n   =   -    m   c  2    α  g  2     4   n  2           subscript  E  n         m   superscript  c  2    superscript   subscript  α  g   2      4   superscript  n  2        E_{n}=-\frac{mc^{2}\alpha_{g}^{2}}{4n^{2}}     in which   n   n   n   is the principal quantum number ,    n  =   1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  ∞       n   1  2  normal-…      n=1,2,...,\infty   and    α  g     subscript  α  g    \alpha_{g}   is the gravitational counterpart of the fine structure constant . The latter is given by       α  g   =     m  2   G    ℏ  c    =    m  2    m  P  2           subscript  α  g        superscript  m  2   G     Planck-constant-over-2-pi  c            superscript  m  2    superscript   subscript  m  P   2       \alpha_{g}=\frac{m^{2}G}{\hbar c}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}     where:     ℏ   Planck-constant-over-2-pi   \hbar   is the Planck constant divided by    2  π      2  π    2\pi   ;     c   c   c   is the speed of light in vacuum;     G   G   G   is the gravitational constant .  The n th excited state of a holeum then has a mass that is given by       m  H   =    2  m   +    E  n    c  2          subscript  m  H       2  m      subscript  E  n    superscript  c  2       m_{H}=2m+\frac{E_{n}}{c^{2}}     The holeum's atomic transitions cause it to emit gravitational radiation .  The radius of the n th excited state of a holeum is given by       r  n   =    (     n  2   R    α  g  2    )    (    π  2   8   )         subscript  r  n          superscript  n  2   R    superscript   subscript  α  g   2       superscript  π  2   8      r_{n}=\left(\frac{n^{2}R}{\alpha_{g}^{2}}\right)\left(\frac{\pi^{2}}{{8}}\right)     where:      R  =   (    2  m  G    c  2    )       R      2  m  G    superscript  c  2      R=\left(\frac{2mG}{c^{2}}\right)   is the Schwarzschild radius of the two identical micro black holes that constitute the holeum.  The holeum is a stable particle. It is the gravitational analogue of the hydrogen atom . It occupies space. Although it is made up of black holes, it itself is not a black hole. As the holeum is a purely gravitational system, it emits only gravitational radiation and no electromagnetic radiation . The holeum can therefore be considered to be a dark matter particle. 3  Macro holeums and their properties  A macro holeum is a quantized gravitational bound state of a large number of micro black holes. The energy eigenvalues of a macro holeum consisting of   k   k   k   identical micro black holes of mass   m   m   m   are given by 4       E  k   =   -      p  2   m   c  2     2   n  k  2       (   1  -    p  2    6   n  2      )   2          subscript  E  k            superscript  p  2   m   superscript  c  2      2   superscript   subscript  n  k   2      superscript    1     superscript  p  2     6   superscript  n  2      2       E_{k}=-\frac{p^{2}mc^{2}}{2n_{k}^{2}}\left(1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)^{2}     where    p  =   k   α  g        p    k   subscript  α  g      p=k\alpha_{g}   and    k  ≫  2     much-greater-than  k  2    k\gg 2   . The system is simplified by assuming that all the micro black holes in the core are in the same quantum state described by   n   n   n   , and that the outermost,    k   t  h      superscript  k    t  h     k^{th}   micro black hole is in an arbitrary quantum state described by the principal quantum number    n  k     subscript  n  k    n_{k}   .  The physical radius of the bound state is given by       r  k   =     π  2   k  R   n  k  2     16   p  2    (   1  -    p  2    6   n  2      )          subscript  r  k        superscript  π  2   k  R   superscript   subscript  n  k   2      16   superscript  p  2     1     superscript  p  2     6   superscript  n  2          r_{k}=\frac{\pi^{2}kRn_{k}^{2}}{16p^{2}\left(1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)}     The mass of the macro holeum is given by       M  k   =   m  k   (   1  -    p  2    6   n  2      )         subscript  M  k     m  k    1     superscript  p  2     6   superscript  n  2         M_{k}=mk\left(1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)     The Schwarzschild radius of the macro holeum is given by       R  k   =   k  R   (   1  -    p  2    6   n  2      )         subscript  R  k     k  R    1     superscript  p  2     6   superscript  n  2         R_{k}=kR\left(1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)     The entropy of the system is given by       S  k   =    k  2   S   (   1  -    p  2    6   n  2      )         subscript  S  k      superscript  k  2   S    1     superscript  p  2     6   superscript  n  2         S_{k}=k^{2}S\left(1-\frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}\right)     where   S   S   S   is the entropy of the individual micro black holes that constitute the macro holeum.  The ground state of macro holeums  The ground state of macro holeums is characterized by    n  =  ∞      n     n=\infty   and     n  k   =  1       subscript  n  k   1    n_{k}=1   . The holeum has maximum binding energy, minimum physical radius, maximum Schwarzschild radius, maximum mass, and maximum entropy in this state.  Such a system can be thought of as consisting of a gas of    k  -  1      k  1    k-1   free (    n  =  ∞      n     n=\infty   ) micro black holes that is bounded and therefore isolated from the outside world by a solitary outermost micro black hole whose principal quantum number is     n  k   =  1       subscript  n  k   1    n_{k}=1   .  Stability  It can be seen from the above equations that the condition for the stability of holeums is given by        p  2    6   n  2     <  1         superscript  p  2     6   superscript  n  2     1    \frac{p^{2}}{6n^{2}}<1     Substituting the relations    p  =   k   α  g        p    k   subscript  α  g      p=k\alpha_{g}   and     α  g   =    m  2    m  P  2         subscript  α  g      superscript  m  2    superscript   subscript  m  P   2      \alpha_{g}=\frac{m^{2}}{m_{P}^{2}}   into this inequality, the condition for the stability of holeums can be expressed as      m  <  ∞      m     m<\infty   , which gives us     r  k   ⩽   R  k        subscript  r  k    subscript  R  k     r_{k}\leqslant R_{k}   as the condition for stability. Thus, the ground state of holeums is guaranteed to be always stable.  Black holeums  A holeum is a black hole if its physical radius is less than or equal to its Schwarzschild radius, i.e. if      r  k     subscript  r  k    r_{k}     Such holeums are termed black holeums. Substituting the expressions for    R  k     subscript  R  k    R_{k}   and    m  ⩾     m  P   2     (    π   n  k    k   )    1  2         m       subscript  m  P   2    superscript      π   subscript  n  k    k     1  2       m\geqslant\frac{m_{P}}{2}\left(\frac{\pi n_{k}}{k}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}   , and simplifying, we obtain the condition for a holeum to be a black holeum to be       n  k   =  1       subscript  n  k   1    n_{k}=1     For the ground state, which is characterized by    m  ⩾     m  P   2     (   π  k   )    1  2         m       subscript  m  P   2    superscript    π  k     1  2       m\geqslant\frac{m_{P}}{2}\left(\frac{\pi}{k}\right)^{\frac{1}{2}}   , this reduces to     k   k   k     Black holeums are an example of black holes with internal structure. Black holeums are quantum black holes whose internal structure can be fully predicted by means of the quantities   m   m   m   ,   n   n   n   ,    n  k     subscript  n  k    n_{k}   , and $n_{k}$ .  Holeums and cosmology  Holeums are speculated to be the progenitors of a class of short duration gamma ray bursts . 5 6 It is also speculated that holeums give rise to cosmic rays of all energies, including ultra-high-energy cosmic rays . 7  See also   Micro black hole  Black hole electron  Planck particle  Dark Matter   References  External links   Acta Physica: Chronicles the development of the theory of holeums  A Stable Holeum  Gravitational Radiation from Holeums  Constructing a Macro Holeum from the Inside Out  The Black Holeum   "  Category:Physical cosmology  Category:Dark matter  Category:Large-scale structure of the cosmos  Category:Astroparticle physics  Category:Exotic matter  Category:Unsolved problems in physics  Category:Particle physics  Category:Theoretical physics  Category:Hypothetical particles     L.K.
