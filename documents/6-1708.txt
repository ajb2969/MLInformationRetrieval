   Whittaker function      Whittaker function   In mathematics, a Whittaker function is a special solution of Whittaker's equation , a modified form of the confluent hypergeometric equation introduced by  to make the formulas involving the solutions more symmetric. More generally,  introduced Whittaker functions of reductive groups over local fields , where the functions studied by Whittaker are essentially the case where the local field is the real numbers and the group is SL 2 ( R ).  Whittaker's equation is  $$\frac{d^2w}{dz^2}+\left(-\frac{1}{4}+\frac{\kappa}{z}+\frac{1/4-\mu^2}{z^2}\right)w=0.$$ It has a regular singular point at 0 and an irregular singular point at ∞. Two solutions are given by the Whittaker functions  M κ,μ ( z ), W κ,μ ( z ), defined in terms of Kummer's confluent hypergeometric functions  M and U by  $$M_{\kappa,\mu}\left(z\right) = \exp\left(-z/2\right)z^{\mu+\tfrac{1}{2}}M\left(\mu-\kappa+\frac{1}{2}, 1+2\mu; z\right)$$  $$W_{\kappa,\mu}\left(z\right) = \exp\left(-z/2\right)z^{\mu+\tfrac{1}{2}}U\left(\mu-\kappa+\frac{1}{2}, 1+2\mu; z\right).$$  Whittaker functions appear as coefficients of certain representations of the group SL 2 ( R ), called Whittaker models .
