Characteristic equation (calculus)
In [[mathematics]], the '''characteristic equation''' (or '''auxiliary equation''') is an [[Algebraic function|algebraic]] equation of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]]  on which depends the solutions of a given {{nowrap begin}}p>th-order differential equation.1 The characteristic equation can only be formed when the differential equation is linear, homogeneous, and has constant coefficients.2 Such a differential equation, with 
 
 
 
  as the dependent variable and 
 
 
 
  as constants,


 
  will have a characteristic equation of the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are the roots from which the general solution can be formed.345 This method of integrating linear ordinary differential equations with constant coefficients was discovered by Leonhard Euler, who found that the solutions depended on an algebraic 'characteristic' equation.6 The qualities of the Euler's characteristic equation were later considered in greater detail by French mathematicians Augustin-Louis Cauchy and Gaspard Monge.78
Derivation
Starting with a linear homogeneous differential equation with constant coefficients 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  it can be seen that if 
 
 
 
 , each term would be a constant multiple of 
 
 
 
 
 . This results from the fact that the derivative of the exponential function

 
  is a multiple of itself. Therefore, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are all multiples. This suggests that certain values of 
 
 
 
 
  will allow multiples of 
 
 
 
  to sum to zero, thus solving the homogeneous differential equation.9 In order to solve for 
 
 
 
 , one can substitute 
 
 
 
  and its derivatives into the differential equation to get


 
  Since 
 
 
 
 
  can never equate to zero, it can be divided out, giving the characteristic equation


 
  By solving for the roots, 
 
 
 
 , in this characteristic equation, one can find the general solution to the differential equation.1011 For example, if 
 
 
 
  is found to equal to 3, then the general solution will be 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary constant.
Formation of the general solution
Solving the characteristic equation for its roots, 
 
 
 
 , allows one to find the general solution of the differential equation. The roots may be real and/or complex, as well as distinct and/or repeated. If a characteristic equation has parts with distinct real roots, 
 
 
 
  repeated roots, and/or 
 
 
 
  complex roots corresponding to general solutions of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively, then the general solution to the differential equation is



Distinct real roots
The superposition principle for linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients says that if 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
linearly independent solutions to a particular differential equation, then 
 
 
 
 
  is also a solution for all values 
 
 
 
 .1213 Therefore, if the characteristic equation has distinct real roots 
 
 
 
 , then a general solution will be of the form



Repeated real roots
If the characteristic equation has a root 
 
 
 
  that is repeated 
 
 
 
 
  times, then it is clear that 
 
 
 
  is at least one solution.14 However, this solution lacks linearly independent solutions from the other 
 
 
 
  roots. Since 
 
 
 
  has multiplicity 
 
 
 
 , the differential equation can be factored into15


 
  The fact that 
 
 
 
  is one solution allows one to presume that the general solution may be of the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a function to be determined. Substituting 
 
 
 
  gives


 
  when 
 
 
 
 . By applying this fact 
 
 
 
  times, it follows that


 
  By dividing out 
 
 
 
 , it can be seen that


 
  However, this is the case if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a polynomial of degree 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
 .16 Since 
 
 
 
 , the part of the general solution corresponding to 
 
 
 
 
  is



Complex roots
If the characteristic equation has complex roots of the form 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then the general solution is accordingly 
 
 
 
 . However, by Euler's formula, which states that 
 
 
 
 
 , this solution can be rewritten as follows:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are constants that can be complex.17
Note that if 
 
 
 
 , then the particular solution 
 
 
 
  is formed.
Similarly, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then the independent solution formed is 
 
 
 
 . Thus by the superposition principle for linear homogeneous differential equations with constant coefficients, the part of a differential equation having complex roots 
 
 
 
  will result in the following general solution
