List of definite integrals

In mathematics, the definite integral:



is the area of the region in the xy-plane bounded by the graph of f, the x-axis, and the lines x = a and x = b, such that area above the x-axis adds to the total, and that below the x-axis subtracts from the total.
The fundamental theorem of calculus establishes the relationship between indefinite and definite integrals and introduces a technique for evaluating definite integrals.
If the interval is infinite the definite integral is called an improper integral and defined by using appropriate limiting procedures. for example:



The following is a list of the most common definite Integrals. For a list of indefinite integrals see List of indefinite integrals
Definite integrals involving rational or irrational expression






































 
  (see Dirichlet integral)




























































Definite integrals involving exponential functions





































































Definite integrals involving logarithmic functions


















$$\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\ln x}{x^2+a^2}\ dx = \frac{\pi \ln a}{2a}\quad a>0$$
Definite integrals involving hyperbolic functions
$\int_{0}^{\infty }\frac{\sin ax}{\sinh bx}\ dx=\frac {\pi}{2b}\tanh \frac{a \pi}{2b}$ $\int_{0}^{\infty }\frac{\cos ax}{\cosh bx}\ dx=\frac {\pi}{2b}\frac{1}{\cosh \frac{a \pi}{2b}}$ $\int_{0}^{\infty }\frac{x}{\sinh ax}\ dx=\frac{\pi^{2}}{4a^{2}}$ $\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\cosh x}\ dx = \pi$
Miscellaneous definite integrals
$\int_{0}^{\infty }\frac{f(ax)-f(bx)}{x}\ dx=[{f(0)-f(\infty)}]\ln \frac{b}{a}$
