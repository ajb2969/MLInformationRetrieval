Bhaskara's lemma

Bhaskara's Lemma is an identity used as a lemma during the chakravala method. It states that:


 
  for integers 
 
 
 
  and non-zero integer 
 
 
 
 .
Proof
The proof follows from simple algebraic manipulations as follows: multiply both sides of the equation by 
 
 
 
 , add 
 
 
 
 , factor, and divide by 
 
 
 
 .












So long as neither 
 
 
 
  nor 
 
 
 
  are zero, the implication goes in both directions. (Note also that the lemma holds for real or complex numbers as well as integers.)
