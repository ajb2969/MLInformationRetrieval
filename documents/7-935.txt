   Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)      Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)   In mathematics , more specifically in abstract algebra , the Frobenius theorem , proved by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1877, characterizes the finite-dimensional  associative  division algebras over the real numbers . According to the theorem, every such algebra is isomorphic to one of the following:      𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   (the real numbers)     𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   (the complex numbers )     𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   (the quaternions ).   These algebras have dimensions    1  ,  2     1  2    1,2   , and   4   4   4   , respectively. Of these three algebras,   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   and   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   are commutative , but   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   is not.  Proof  The main ingredients for the following proof are the Cayley–Hamilton theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra .  Introducing some notation   We identify the real multiples of   1   1   1   with   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   .    When we write    a  ≤  0      a  normal-≤  0    a≤0   for an element   a   a   a   of   D   D   D   , we tacitly assume that   a   a   a   is contained in   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   .    We can consider   D   D   D   as a finite-dimensional   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   - vector space . Any element   d   d   d   of   D   D   D   defines an endomorphism of   D   D   D   by left-multiplication, we identify   d   d   d   with that endomorphism. Therefore we can speak about the trace of   d   d   d   , and its characteristic and minimal  polynomials .    For any   z   z   z   in   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   define the following real quadratic polynomial:           Q   (  z  ;  x  )    =     x  2   -   2    Re   (  z  )    x     +    |  z  |   2    =    (   x  -  z   )    (   x  -   z  ¯    )    ∈   𝐑   [  x  ]     .          Q   z  x         superscript  x  2     2    Re  z   x      superscript    z   2             x  z     x   normal-¯  z            𝐑   delimited-[]  x       Q(z;x)=x^{2}-2\operatorname{Re}(z)x+|z|^{2}=(x-z)(x-\overline{z})\in\mathbf{R}%
 [x].       Note that if    z  ∈   𝐂   𝐑      z  normal-∈  𝐂  𝐑    z∈\mathbf{C}\ \mathbf{R}   then    Q   (  z  ;  x  )       Q   z  x     Q(z;x)   is irreducible over   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   .   The claim  The key to the argument is the following   Claim. The set   V   V   V   of all elements   a   a   a   of   D   D   D   such that is a vector subspace of   D   D   D   of codimension    1   1   1   . Moreover    D  =   𝐑  ⊕  V       D    𝐑  normal-⊕  V     D=\mathbf{R}⊕V   as   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   -vector spaces, which implies that   V   V   V   generates   D   D   D   as an algebra.   Proof of Claim: Let   m   m   m   be the dimension of   D   D   D   as an   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   -vector space, and pick   a   a   a   in   D   D   D   with characteristic polynomial    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   . By the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can write         p   (  x  )    =    (   x  -   t  1    )   ⋯   (   x  -   t  r    )    (   x  -   z  1    )    (   x  -    z  1   ¯    )   ⋯   (   x  -   z  s    )    (   x  -    z  s   ¯    )     ,     t  i   ∈  𝐑   ,    z  j   ∈   𝐂  \  𝐑      .     formulae-sequence      p  x       x   subscript  t  1    normal-⋯    x   subscript  t  r      x   subscript  z  1      x   normal-¯   subscript  z  1     normal-⋯    x   subscript  z  s      x   normal-¯   subscript  z  s        formulae-sequence     subscript  t  i   𝐑      subscript  z  j    normal-\  𝐂  𝐑       p(x)=(x-t_{1})\cdots(x-t_{r})(x-z_{1})(x-\overline{z_{1}})\cdots(x-z_{s})(x-%
 \overline{z_{s}}),\qquad t_{i}\in\mathbf{R},\quad z_{j}\in\mathbf{C}\backslash%
 \mathbf{R}.     We can rewrite    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   in terms of the polynomials    Q   (  z  ;  x  )       Q   z  x     Q(z;x)   :        p   (  x  )    =    (   x  -   t  1    )   ⋯   (   x  -   t  r    )   Q   (   z  1   ;  x  )   ⋯  Q   (   z  s   ;  x  )     .        p  x       x   subscript  t  1    normal-⋯    x   subscript  t  r    Q    subscript  z  1   x   normal-⋯  Q    subscript  z  s   x      p(x)=(x-t_{1})\cdots(x-t_{r})Q(z_{1};x)\cdots Q(z_{s};x).     Since , the polynomials are all irreducible over   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   . By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem,     p   (  a  )    =  0        p  a   0    p(a)=0   and because   D   D   D   is a division algebra, it follows that either 0}} for some   i   i   i   or that 0}} for some   j   j   j   . The first case implies that   a   a   a   is real. In the second case, it follows that is the minimal polynomial of   a   a   a   . Because    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   has the same complex roots as the minimal polynomial and because it is real it follows that       p   (  x  )    =   Q    (   z  j   ;  x  )   k    =    (     x  2   -   2    Re   (   z  j   )    x     +    |   z  j   |   2    )   k           p  x     Q   superscript    subscript  z  j   x   k          superscript       superscript  x  2     2    Re   subscript  z  j    x      superscript     subscript  z  j    2    k      p(x)=Q(z_{j};x)^{k}=\left(x^{2}-2\operatorname{Re}(z_{j})x+|z_{j}|^{2}\right)^%
 {k}     Since    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   is the characteristic polynomial of   a   a   a   the coefficient of in    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   is    t  r   (  a  )       t  r  a    tr(a)   up to a sign. Therefore we read from the above equation we have:     t  r   (  a  )    =  0        t  r  a   0    tr(a)=0   if and only if 0}} , in other words     t  r   (  a  )    =  0        t  r  a   0    tr(a)=0   if and only if −{{!}} z j {{!}} 2 .  So   V   V   V   is the subset of all   a   a   a   with     t  r   (  a  )    =  0        t  r  a   0    tr(a)=0   . In particular, it is a vector subspace. Moreover,   V   V   V   has codimension   1   1   1   since it is the kernel of a non-zero linear form, and note that   D   D   D   is the direct sum of   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   and   V   V   V   as vector spaces.  The finish  For    a  ,  b     a  b    a,b   in   V   V   V   define     B   (  a  ,  b  )    =    (   −  a  b  −  b  a   )   /  2         B   a  b        normal-−  a  b  normal-−  b  a   2     B(a,b)=(−ab−ba)/2   . Because of the identity  ab + ba }} , it follows that    B   (  a  ,  b  )       B   a  b     B(a,b)   is real. Furthermore since , we have:     B   (  a  ,  a  )    >  0        B   a  a    0    B(a,a)>0   for    a  ≠  0      a  normal-≠  0    a≠0   . Thus   B   B   B   is a positive definite  symmetric bilinear form , in other words, an inner product on   V   V   V   .  Let   W   W   W   be a subspace of   V   V   V   that generates   D   D   D   as an algebra and which is minimal with respect to this property. Let be an orthonormal basis of   W   W   W   . With respect to the negative definite bilinear form    −  B      normal-−  B    −B   these elements satisfy the following relations:         e  i  2   =   -  1    ,     e  i    e  j    =   -    e  j    e  i       .     formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  e  i   2     1         subscript  e  i    subscript  e  j         subscript  e  j    subscript  e  i        e_{i}^{2}=-1,\quad e_{i}e_{j}=-e_{j}e_{i}.     If    n  =  0      n  0    n=0   , then   D   D   D   is isomorphic to   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   .  If    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   , then   D   D   D   is generated by   1   1   1   and subject to the relation    e  =   −  1       e    normal-−  1     e=−1   . Hence it is isomorphic to   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   .  If    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   , it has been shown above that   D   D   D   is generated by subject to the relations        e  1  2   =   e  2  2   =   -  1    ,      e  1    e  2    =   -    e  2    e  1      ,     (    e  1    e  2    )    (    e  1    e  2    )    =   -  1.        formulae-sequence       superscript   subscript  e  1   2    superscript   subscript  e  2   2          1      formulae-sequence       subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2         subscript  e  2    subscript  e  1             subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2       subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2       1.       e_{1}^{2}=e_{2}^{2}=-1,\quad e_{1}e_{2}=-e_{2}e_{1},\quad(e_{1}e_{2})(e_{1}e_{%
 2})=-1.   These are precisely the relations for   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   .  If    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   , then   D   D   D   cannot be a division algebra. Assume that    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   . Let  e 1 e 2 e n }} . It is easy to see that 1}} (this only works if    n  >  2      n  2    n>2   ). If   D   D   D   were a division algebra,  u 2 − 1 {{=}} ( u − 1)( u + 1)}} implies    u  =   ±  1       u    normal-±  1     u=±1   , which in turn means: ∓ e 1 e 2 }} and so generate   D   D   D   . This contradicts the minimality of   W   W   W   .  Remarks and related results   The fact that   D   D   D   is generated by subject to the above relations means that   D   D   D   is the Clifford algebra of . The last step shows that the only real Clifford algebras which are division algebras are and .    As a consequence, the only commutative division algebras are   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   and   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   . Also note that   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   is not a   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   -algebra. If it were, then the center of   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   has to contain   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   , but the center of   𝐇   𝐇   \mathbf{H}   is   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   . Therefore, the only division algebra over   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   is   𝐂   𝐂   \mathbf{C}   itself.    This theorem is closely related to Hurwitz's theorem , which states that the only real normed division algebras are    𝐑  ,  𝐂  ,  𝐇     𝐑  𝐂  𝐇    \mathbf{R},\mathbf{C},\mathbf{H}   , and the (non-associative) algebra    𝐎   𝐎   \mathbf{O}    .
