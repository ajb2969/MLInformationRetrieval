Frobenius theorem (real division algebras)

In mathematics, more specifically in abstract algebra, the Frobenius theorem, proved by Ferdinand Georg Frobenius in 1877, characterizes the finite-dimensional associative division algebras over the real numbers. According to the theorem, every such algebra is isomorphic to one of the following:



 
  (the real numbers)


 
  (the complex numbers)


 
  (the quaternions).

These algebras have dimensions 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. Of these three algebras, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are commutative, but 
 
 
 
  is not.
Proof
The main ingredients for the following proof are the Cayley–Hamilton theorem and the fundamental theorem of algebra.
Introducing some notation

We identify the real multiples of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .


When we write 
 
 
 
  for an element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , we tacitly assume that 
 
 
 
  is contained in 
 
 
 
 .


We can consider 
 
 
 
  as a finite-dimensional 
 
 
 
 -vector space. Any element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  defines an endomorphism of 
 
 
 
  by left-multiplication, we identify 
 
 
 
  with that endomorphism. Therefore we can speak about the trace of 
 
 
 
 , and its characteristic and minimal polynomials.


For any 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  define the following real quadratic polynomial:








Note that if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is irreducible over 
 
 
 
 .
 

The claim
The key to the argument is the following

Claim. The set 
 
 
 
  of all elements 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that  is a vector subspace of 
 
 
 
  of codimension

 
 . Moreover 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 -vector spaces, which implies that 
 
 
 
  generates 
 
 
 
  as an algebra.
 

Proof of Claim: Let 
 
 
 
  be the dimension of 
 
 
 
  as an 
 
 
 
 -vector space, and pick 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  with characteristic polynomial 
 
 
 
 . By the fundamental theorem of algebra, we can write



We can rewrite 
 
 
 
  in terms of the polynomials 
 
 
 
 :



Since , the polynomials  are all irreducible over 
 
 
 
 . By the Cayley–Hamilton theorem, 
 
 
 
  and because 
 
 
 
  is a division algebra, it follows that either  0}} for some 
 
 
 
  or that  0}} for some 
 
 
 
 . The first case implies that 
 
 
 
  is real. In the second case, it follows that  is the minimal polynomial of 
 
 
 
 . Because 
 
 
 
  has the same complex roots as the minimal polynomial and because it is real it follows that



Since 
 
 
 
  is the characteristic polynomial of 
 
 
 
  the coefficient of  in 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  up to a sign. Therefore we read from the above equation we have: 
 
 
 
  if and only if  0}}, in other words 
 
 
 
  if and only if  −{{!}}zj{{!}}2 .
So 
 
 
 
  is the subset of all 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 . In particular, it is a vector subspace. Moreover, 
 
 
 
  has codimension 
 
 
 
  since it is the kernel of a non-zero linear form, and note that 
 
 
 
  is the direct sum of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  as vector spaces.
The finish
For 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  define 
 
 
 
 . Because of the identity  ab + ba}}, it follows that 
 
 
 
  is real. Furthermore since , we have: 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is a positive definite symmetric bilinear form, in other words, an inner product on 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be a subspace of 
 
 
 
  that generates 
 
 
 
  as an algebra and which is minimal with respect to this property. Let  be an orthonormal basis of 
 
 
 
 . With respect to the negative definite bilinear form 
 
 
 
  these elements satisfy the following relations:



If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is generated by 
 
 
 
  and  subject to the relation 
 
 
 
 . Hence it is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , it has been shown above that 
 
 
 
  is generated by  subject to the relations


 
  These are precisely the relations for 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  cannot be a division algebra. Assume that 
 
 
 
 . Let  e1e2en}}. It is easy to see that  1}} (this only works if 
 
 
 
 ). If 
 
 
 
  were a division algebra,  u2 − 1 {{=}} (u − 1)(u + 1)}} implies 
 
 
 
 , which in turn means:  ∓e1e2}} and so  generate 
 
 
 
 . This contradicts the minimality of 
 
 
 
 .
Remarks and related results

The fact that 
 
 
 
  is generated by  subject to the above relations means that 
 
 
 
  is the Clifford algebra of . The last step shows that the only real Clifford algebras which are division algebras are  and .


As a consequence, the only commutative division algebras are 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Also note that 
 
 
 
  is not a 
 
 
 
 -algebra. If it were, then the center of 
 
 
 
  has to contain 
 
 
 
 , but the center of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, the only division algebra over 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  itself.


This theorem is closely related to Hurwitz's theorem, which states that the only real normed division algebras are 
 
 
 
 , and the (non-associative) algebra
