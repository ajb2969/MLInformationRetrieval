   Cotangent space      Cotangent space   In differential geometry , one can attach to every point x of a smooth (or differentiable) manifold a vector space called the cotangent space at x . Typically, the cotangent space is defined as the dual space of the tangent space at x , although there are more direct definitions (see below). The elements of the cotangent space are called cotangent vectors or tangent covectors .  Properties  All cotangent spaces on a connected manifold have the same dimension , equal to the dimension of the manifold. All the cotangent spaces of a manifold can be "glued together" (i.e. unioned and endowed with a topology) to form a new differentiable manifold of twice the dimension, the cotangent bundle of the manifold.  The tangent space and the cotangent space at a point are both real vector spaces of the same dimension and therefore isomorphic to each other via many possible isomorphisms. The introduction of a Riemannian metric or a symplectic form gives rise to a natural isomorphism between the tangent space and the cotangent space at a point, associating to any tangent covector a canonical tangent vector.  Formal definitions  Definition as linear functionals  Let M be a smooth manifold and let x be a point in M . Let T x M be the tangent space at x . Then the cotangent space at x is defined as the dual space of T x M :   T x * M = ( T x M ) *    Concretely, elements of the cotangent space are linear functionals on T x M . That is, every element α ∈ T x * M is a linear map   α : T x M → F    where F is the underlying field of the vector space being considered. For example, the field of real numbers . The elements of T x * M are called cotangent vectors.  Alternative definition  In some cases, one might like to have a direct definition of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on M . Informally, we will say that two smooth functions f and g are equivalent at a point x if they have the same first-order behavior near x. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near x.  Let M be a smooth manifold and let x be a point in M . Let I x be the ideal of all functions in C ∞ ( M ) vanishing at x , and let I x 2 be the set of functions of the form     ∑  i     f  i     g  i         subscript   i      subscript  f  i    subscript  g  i      \sum_{i}f_{i}g_{i}\,   , where f i , g i ∈ I x . Then I x and I x 2 are real vector spaces and the cotangent space is defined as the quotient space  T x * M = I x / I x 2 .  This formulation is analogous to the construction of the cotangent space to define the Zariski tangent space in algebraic geometry. The construction also generalizes to locally ringed spaces .  The differential of a function  Let M be a smooth manifold and let f ∈ C ∞ ( M ) be a smooth function . The differential of f at a point x is the map   d f x ( X x ) = X x ( f )   where X x is a tangent vector at x , thought of as a derivation. That is     X   (  f  )    =    ℒ  X   f         X  f      subscript  ℒ  X   f     X(f)=\mathcal{L}_{X}f   is the Lie derivative of f in the direction X , and one has d f ( X )= X ( f ). Equivalently, we can think of tangent vectors as tangents to curves, and write   d f x (γ′(0)) = ( f o γ)′(0)   In either case, d f x is a linear map on T x M and hence it is a tangent covector at x .  We can then define the differential map d : C ∞ ( M ) → T x * M at a point x as the map which sends f to d f x . Properties of the differential map include:   d is a linear map: d( af + bg ) = a d f + b d g for constants a and b ,  d( fg ) x = f ( x )d g x + g ( x )d f x ,   The differential map provides the link between the two alternate definitions of the cotangent space given above. Given a function f ∈ I x (a smooth function vanishing at x ) we can form the linear functional d f x as above. Since the map d restricts to 0 on I x 2 (the reader should verify this), d descends to a map from I x / I x 2 to the dual of the tangent space, ( T x M ) * . One can show that this map is an isomorphism, establishing the equivalence of the two definitions.  The pullback of a smooth map  Just as every differentiable map f : M → N between manifolds induces a linear map (called the pushforward or derivative ) between the tangent spaces       f  *   :     T  x   M   →    T   f   (  x  )     N       normal-:   subscript  f     normal-→     subscript  T  x   M      subscript  T    f  x    N      f_{*}\colon T_{x}M\to T_{f(x)}N   every such map induces a linear map (called the pullback ) between the cotangent spaces, only this time in the reverse direction:       f  *   :     T   f   (  x  )    *   N   →    T  x  *   M       normal-:   superscript  f     normal-→     superscript   subscript  T    f  x      N      superscript   subscript  T  x     M      f^{*}\colon T_{f(x)}^{*}N\to T_{x}^{*}M   The pullback is naturally defined as the dual (or transpose) of the pushforward . Unraveling the definition, this means the following:        (    f  *   θ   )    (   X  x   )    =   θ   (    f  *    X  x    )             superscript  f    θ    subscript  X  x      θ     subscript  f     subscript  X  x       (f^{*}\theta)(X_{x})=\theta(f_{*}X_{x})   where θ ∈ T f ( x ) * N and X x ∈ T x M . Note carefully where everything lives.  If we define tangent covectors in terms of equivalence classes of smooth maps vanishing at a point then the definition of the pullback is even more straightforward. Let g be a smooth function on N vanishing at f ( x ). Then the pullback of the covector determined by g (denoted d g ) is given by         f  *   d  g   =   d   (   g  ∘  f   )     .         superscript  f    normal-d  g     normal-d    g  f      f^{*}\mathrm{d}g=\mathrm{d}(g\circ f).   That is, it is the equivalence class of functions on M vanishing at x determined by g o f .  Exterior powers  The k -th exterior power of the cotangent space, denoted Λ k ( T x * M ), is another important object in differential geometry. Vectors in the k th exterior power, or more precisely sections of the k -th exterior power of the cotangent bundle , are called differential k -forms . They can be thought of as alternating, multilinear maps on k tangent vectors. For this reason, tangent covectors are frequently called one-forms .
