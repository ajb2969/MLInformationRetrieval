   Hydrodynamic radius      Hydrodynamic radius   The hydrodynamic radius of a macromolecule or colloid particle has two meanings. Some books use it as a synonym for the Stokes radius . 1  Others books define a theoretical hydrodynamic radius    R  hyd     subscript  R  hyd    R_{\rm hyd}   . They consider the macromolecule or colloid particle to be a collection of   N   N   N   subparticles. This is done most commonly for polymers ; the subparticles would then be the units of the polymer.    R  hyd     subscript  R  hyd    R_{\rm hyd}   is defined by        1   R  hyd       =  def      1   N  2     ⟨    ∑   i  ≠  j     1   r   i  j      ⟩        superscript   def     1   subscript  R  hyd        1   superscript  N  2     delimited-⟨⟩    subscript     i  j      1   subscript  r    i  j          \frac{1}{R_{\rm hyd}}\ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{1}{N^{2}}\left\langle%
 \sum_{i\neq j}\frac{1}{r_{ij}}\right\rangle     where    r   i  j      subscript  r    i  j     r_{ij}   is the distance between subparticles   i   i   i   and   j   j   j   , and where the angular brackets    ⟨  …  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  normal-…    \langle\ldots\rangle   represent an ensemble average . 2 The theoretical hydrodynamic radius    R  hyd     subscript  R  hyd    R_{\rm hyd}   was originally an estimate by John Gamble Kirkwood of the Stokes radius of a polymer.  The theoretical hydrodynamic radius    R  hyd     subscript  R  hyd    R_{\rm hyd}   arises in the study of the dynamic properties of polymers moving in a solvent . It is often similar in magnitude to the radius of gyration .  Notes    References  Grosberg AY and Khokhlov AR. (1994) Statistical Physics of Macromolecules (translated by Atanov YA), AIP Press.
