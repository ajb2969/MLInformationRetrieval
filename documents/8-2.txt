Hydrodynamic radius

The hydrodynamic radius of a macromolecule or colloid particle has two meanings. Some books use it as a synonym for the Stokes radius. 1
Others books define a theoretical hydrodynamic radius 
 
 
 
 . They consider the macromolecule or colloid particle to be a collection of 
 
 
 
  subparticles. This is done most commonly for polymers; the subparticles would then be the units of the polymer. 
 
 
 
  is defined by



where 
 
 
 
  is the distance between subparticles 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and where the angular brackets 
 
 
 
  represent an ensemble average. 2 The theoretical hydrodynamic radius 
 
 
 
  was originally an estimate by John Gamble Kirkwood of the Stokes radius of a polymer.
The theoretical hydrodynamic radius 
 
 
 
  arises in the study of the dynamic properties of polymers moving in a solvent. It is often similar in magnitude to the radius of gyration.
