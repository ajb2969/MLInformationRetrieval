   Methionine-S-oxide reductase      Methionine-S-oxide reductase   Methionine-S-oxide reductase (, methyl sulfoxide reductase I and II , acetylmethionine sulfoxide reductase , methionine sulfoxide reductase , L-methionine:oxidized-thioredoxin S-oxidoreductase ) is an enzyme with system name L-methionine:thioredoxin-disulfide S-oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   L- methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L- methionine S-oxide + thioredoxin    In the reverse reaction, dithiothreitol can replace reduced thioredoxin.
