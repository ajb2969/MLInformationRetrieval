Methionine-S-oxide reductase

Methionine-S-oxide reductase (, methyl sulfoxide reductase I and II, acetylmethionine sulfoxide reductase, methionine sulfoxide reductase, L-methionine:oxidized-thioredoxin S-oxidoreductase) is an enzyme with system name L-methionine:thioredoxin-disulfide S-oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

L-methionine + thioredoxin disulfide + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-methionine S-oxide + thioredoxin


In the reverse reaction, dithiothreitol can replace reduced thioredoxin.
