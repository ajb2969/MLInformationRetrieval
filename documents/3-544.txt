   Sierpi≈Ñski space      Sierpi≈Ñski space   In mathematics , the Sierpi≈Ñski space (or the connected two-point set ) is a finite topological space with two points, only one of which is closed . It is the smallest example of a topological space which is neither trivial nor discrete . It is named after Wac≈Çaw Sierpi≈Ñski .  The Sierpi≈Ñski space has important relations to the theory of computation and semantics . 1 2  Definition and fundamental properties  Explicitly, the Sierpi≈Ñski space is a topological space  S whose underlying point set is {0,1} and whose open sets are       {  ‚àÖ  ,   {  1  }   ,   {  0  ,  1  }   }   .       1    0  1     \{\varnothing,\{1\},\{0,1\}\}.   The closed sets are       {  ‚àÖ  ,   {  0  }   ,   {  0  ,  1  }   }   .       0    0  1     \{\varnothing,\{0\},\{0,1\}\}.   So the singleton set {0} is closed (but not open) and the set {1} is open (but not closed).  The closure operator on S is determined by          {  0  }   ¬Ø   =   {  0  }    ,     {  1  }   ¬Ø   =   {  0  ,  1  }     .     formulae-sequence     normal-¬Ø   0     0       normal-¬Ø   1     0  1      \overline{\{0\}}=\{0\},\qquad\overline{\{1\}}=\{0,1\}.     A finite topological space is also uniquely determined by its specialization preorder . For the Sierpi≈Ñski space this preorder is actually a partial order and given by       0  ‚â§  0   ,    0  ‚â§  1   ,   1  ‚â§  1.       formulae-sequence    0  0    formulae-sequence    0  1     1  1.      0\leq 0,\qquad 0\leq 1,\qquad 1\leq 1.     Topological properties  The Sierpi≈Ñski space S is a special case of both the finite particular point topology (with particular point 1) and the finite excluded point topology (with excluded point 0). Therefore S has many properties in common with one or both of these families.  Separation   The points 0 and 1 are topologically distinguishable in S since {1} is an open set which contains only one of these points. Therefore S is a Kolmogorov (T 0 ) space .  However, S is not T 1 since the point 1 is not closed. It follows that S is not Hausdorff , or T n for any n ‚â• 1.  S is not regular (or completely regular ) since the point 1 and the disjoint closed set {0} cannot be separated by neighborhoods . (Also regularity in the presence of T 0 would imply Hausdorff.)  S is vacuously  normal and completely normal since there are no nonempty separated sets .  S is not perfectly normal since the disjoint closed sets ‚àÖ and {0} cannot be precisely separated by a function. Indeed {0} cannot be the zero set of any continuous function  S ‚Üí R since every such function is constant .   Connectedness   The Sierpi≈Ñski space S is both hyperconnected (since every nonempty open set contains 1) and ultraconnected (since every nonempty closed set contains 0).  It follows that S is both connected and path connected .  A path from 0 to 1 in S is given by the function: f (0) = 0 and f ( t ) = 1 for t > 0. The function f : I ‚Üí S is continuous since f ‚àí1 (1) = (0,1] which is open in I .  Like all finite topological spaces, S is locally path connected .  The Sierpi≈Ñski space is contractible , so the fundamental group of S is trivial (as are all the higher homotopy groups ).   Compactness   Like all finite topological spaces, the Sierpi≈Ñski space is both compact and second-countable .  The compact subset {1} of S is not closed showing that compact subsets of T 0 spaces need not be closed.  Every open cover of S must contain S itself since S is the only open neighborhood of 0. Therefore every open cover of S has an open subcover consisting of a single set: { S }.  It follows that S is fully normal . 3   Convergence   Every sequence in S  converges to the point 0. This is because the only neighborhood of 0 is S itself.  A sequence in S converges to 1 if and only if the sequence contains only finitely many terms equal to 0 (i.e. the sequence is eventually just 1's).  The point 1 is a cluster point of a sequence in S if and only if the sequence contains infinitely many 1's.  Examples :  1 is not a cluster point of (0,0,0,0,‚Ä¶).  1 is a cluster point (but not a limit) of (0,1,0,1,0,1,‚Ä¶).  The sequence (1,1,1,1,‚Ä¶) converges to both 0 and 1.    Metrizability   The Sierpi≈Ñski space S is not metrizable or even pseudometrizable since every pseudometric space is completely regular but the Sierpi≈Ñski space it is not even regular .  S is generated by the hemimetric (or pseudo - quasimetric )     d   (  0  ,  1  )    =  0        d   0  1    0    d(0,1)=0   and     d   (  1  ,  0  )    =  1        d   1  0    1    d(1,0)=1   .   Other properties   There are only three continuous maps from S to itself: the identity map and the constant maps to 0 and 1.  It follows that the homeomorphism group of S is trivial .   Continuous functions to the Sierpi≈Ñski space  Let X be an arbitrary set. The set of all functions from X to the set {0,1} is typically denoted 2 X . These functions are precisely the characteristic functions of X . Each such function is of the form        œá  U    (  x  )    =   {     1     x  ‚àà  U       0     x  ‚àâ  U              subscript  œá  U   x    cases  1    x  U   0    x  U      \chi_{U}(x)=\begin{cases}1&x\in U\\
 0&x\not\in U\end{cases}   where U is a subset of X . In other words, the set of functions 2 X is in bijective correspondence with P ( X ), the power set of X . Every subset U of X has its characteristic function œá U and every function from X to {0,1} is of this form.  Now suppose X is a topological space and let {0,1} have the Sierpi≈Ñski topology. Then a function œá U : X ‚Üí S is continuous if and only if œá U ‚àí1 (1) is open in X . But, by definition         œá  U   -  1     (  1  )    =  U   .         superscript   subscript  œá  U     1    1   U    \chi_{U}^{-1}(1)=U.   So œá U is continuous if and only if U is open in X . Let C( X , S ) denote the set of all continuous maps from X to S and let T ( X ) denote the topology of X (i.e. the family of all open sets). Then we have a bijection from T ( X ) to C( X , S ) which sends the open set U to œá U .       C   (  X  ,  S  )    ‚âÖ   ùíØ   (  X  )          C   X  S      ùíØ  X     C(X,S)\cong\mathcal{T}(X)   That is, if we identify 2 X with P ( X ), the subset of continuous maps C( X , S ) ‚äÇ 2 X is precisely the topology of X : T ( X ) ‚äÇ P ( X ).  Categorical description  The above construction can be described nicely using the language of category theory . There is contravariant functor  T : Top ‚Üí Set from the category of topological spaces to the category of sets which assigns each topological space X its set of open sets T ( X ) and each continuous function f : X ‚Üí Y the preimage map        f   -  1    :    ùíØ   (  Y  )    ‚Üí   ùíØ   (  X  )      .     normal-:   superscript  f    1     normal-‚Üí    ùíØ  Y     ùíØ  X      f^{-1}:\mathcal{T}(Y)\to\mathcal{T}(X).   The statement then becomes: the functor T is represented by ( S , {1}) where S is the Sierpi≈Ñski space. That is, T is naturally isomorphic to the Hom functor Hom(‚Äì, S ) with the natural isomorphism determined by the universal element {1} ‚àà T ( S ).  The initial topology  Any topological space X has the initial topology induced by the family C( X , S ) of continuous functions to Sierpi≈Ñski space. Indeed, in order to coarsen the topology on X one must remove open sets. But removing the open set U would render œá U discontinuous. So X has the coarsest topology for which each function in C( X , S ) is continuous.  The family of functions C( X , S ) separates points in X if and only if X is a T 0 space . Two points x and y will be separated by the function œá U if and only if the open set U contains precisely one of the two points. This is exactly what it means for x and y to be topologically distinguishable .  Therefore if X is T 0 , we can embed X as a subspace of a product of Sierpi≈Ñski spaces, where there is one copy of S for each open set U in X . The embedding map      e  :   X  ‚Üí    ‚àè   U  ‚àà   ùíØ   (  X  )      S   =   S   ùíØ   (  X  )         normal-:  e     normal-‚Üí  X    subscript  product    U    ùíØ  X     S         superscript  S    ùíØ  X        e:X\to\prod_{U\in\mathcal{T}(X)}S=S^{\mathcal{T}(X)}   is given by        e    (  x  )   U    =    œá  U    (  x  )     .        e   subscript  x  U       subscript  œá  U   x     e(x)_{U}=\chi_{U}(x).\,   Since subspaces and products of T 0 spaces are T 0 , it follows that a topological space is T 0 if and only if it is homeomorphic to a subspace of a power of S .  In algebraic geometry  In algebraic geometry the Sierpi≈Ñski space arises as the spectrum , Spec( R ), of a discrete valuation ring  R such as Z ( p ) (the localization of the integers at the prime ideal generated by the prime number p ). The generic point of Spec( R ), coming from the zero ideal , corresponds to the open point 1, while the special point of Spec( R ), coming from the unique maximal ideal , corresponds to the closed point 0.
