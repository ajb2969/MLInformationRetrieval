   Yao's test      Yao's test   In cryptography and the theory of computation , Yao's test is a test defined by Andrew Chi-Chih Yao in 1982 , 1 against pseudo-random sequences. A sequence of words passes Yao's test if an attacker with reasonable computational power cannot distinguish it from a sequence generated uniformly at random.  Formal statement  Boolean circuits  Let   P   P   P   be a polynomial, and    S  =    {   S  k   }   k       S   subscript    subscript  S  k    k     S=\{S_{k}\}_{k}   be a collection of sets    S  k     subscript  S  k    S_{k}   of    P   (  k  )       P  k    P(k)   -bit long sequences, and for each   k   k   k   , let    Œº  k     subscript  Œº  k    \mu_{k}   be a probability distribution on    S  k     subscript  S  k    S_{k}   , and    P  C     subscript  P  C    P_{C}   be a polynomial. A predicting collection    C  =   {   C  k   }       C    subscript  C  k      C=\{C_{k}\}   is a collection of boolean circuits of size less than     P  C    (  k  )        subscript  P  C   k    P_{C}(k)   . Let    p   k  ,  S   C     superscript   subscript  p   k  S    C    p_{k,S}^{C}   be the probability that on input   s   s   s   , a string randomly selected in    S  k     subscript  S  k    S_{k}   with probability    Œº   (  s  )       Œº  s    \mu(s)   ,      C  k    (  s  )    =  1         subscript  C  k   s   1    C_{k}(s)=1   , i.e.        p   k  ,  S   C   =  ùí´   [   C  k    (  s  )   =  1  |  s  ‚àà   S  k   with probability   Œº  k    (  s  )   ]      fragments   superscript   subscript  p   k  S    C    P   fragments  normal-[   subscript  C  k    fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)    1  normal-|  s    subscript  S  k   with probability   subscript  Œº  k    fragments  normal-(  s  normal-)   normal-]     p_{k,S}^{C}={\mathcal{P}}[C_{k}(s)=1|s\in S_{k}\text{ with probability }\mu_{k%
 }(s)]      Moreover, let    p   k  ,  U   C     superscript   subscript  p   k  U    C    p_{k,U}^{C}   be the probability that      C  k    (  s  )    =  1         subscript  C  k   s   1    C_{k}(s)=1   on input   s   s   s   a    P   (  k  )       P  k    P(k)   -bit long sequence selected uniformly at random in     {  0  ,  1  }    P   (  k  )       superscript   0  1     P  k     \{0,1\}^{P(k)}   . We say that   S   S   S   passes Yao's test if for all predicting collection   C   C   C   , for all but finitely many   k   k   k   , for all polynomial   Q   Q   Q   :        |    p   k  ,  S   C   -   p   k  ,  U   C    |   <   1   Q   (  k  )              superscript   subscript  p   k  S    C    superscript   subscript  p   k  U    C       1    Q  k      |p_{k,S}^{C}-p_{k,U}^{C}|<\frac{1}{Q(k)}      Probabilistic formulation  As in the case of the next-bit test , the predicting collection used in the above definition can be replaced by a probabilistic Turing machine, working in polynomial time. This also yields a strictly stronger definition of Yao's test (see Adleman's theorem ). Indeed, One could decide undecidable properties of the pseudo-random sequence with the non-uniform circuits described above, whereas BPP machines can always be simulated by exponential-time deterministic Turing machines .
