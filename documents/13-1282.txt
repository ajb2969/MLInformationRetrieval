Yao's test

In cryptography and the theory of computation, Yao's test is a test defined by Andrew Chi-Chih Yao in 1982 ,1 against pseudo-random sequences. A sequence of words passes Yao's test if an attacker with reasonable computational power cannot distinguish it from a sequence generated uniformly at random.
Formal statement
Boolean circuits
Let 
 
 
 
  be a polynomial, and 
 
 
 
  be a collection of sets 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 -bit long sequences, and for each 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be a probability distribution on 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be a polynomial. A predicting collection 
 
 
 
  is a collection of boolean circuits of size less than 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the probability that on input 
 
 
 
 , a string randomly selected in 
 
 
 
  with probability 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , i.e.





Moreover, let 
 
 
 
  be the probability that 
 
 
 
  on input 
 
 
 
  a 
 
 
 
 -bit long sequence selected uniformly at random in 
 
 
 
 . We say that 
 
 
 
  passes Yao's test if for all predicting collection 
 
 
 
 , for all but finitely many 
 
 
 
 , for all polynomial 
 
 
 
  :





Probabilistic formulation
As in the case of the next-bit test, the predicting collection used in the above definition can be replaced by a probabilistic Turing machine, working in polynomial time. This also yields a strictly stronger definition of Yao's test (see Adleman's theorem). Indeed, One could decide undecidable properties of the pseudo-random sequence with the non-uniform circuits described above, whereas BPP machines can always be simulated by exponential-time deterministic Turing machines.
