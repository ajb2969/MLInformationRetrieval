Zassenhaus algorithm

In mathematics, the Zassenhaus algorithm1 is a method to calculate a basis for the intersection and sum of two subspaces of a vector space. It is named after Hans Zassenhaus, but no publication of this algorithm by him is known.2 It is used in computer algebra systems.3
Algorithm
Input
Let 
 
 
 
  be a vector space and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  two finite-dimensional subspaces of 
 
 
 
  with the following spanning sets:


 
  and


 
  Finally, let 
 
 
 
  be linearly independent vectors so that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  can be written as


 
  and



Output
The algorithm computes the base of the sum

 
  and a base of the intersection

 
 .
Algorithm
The algorithm creates the following block matrix of size 
 
 
 
 :



Using elementary row operations, this matrix is transformed to the row echelon form. Then, it has the following shape:


 
  Here, 
 
 
 
  stands for arbitrary numbers, and the vectors 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
  are nonzero.
Then 
 
 
 
  with


 
  is a basis of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with


 
  is a basis of 
 
 
 
 .
Proof of correctness
First, we define 
 
 
 
  to be the projection to the first component.
Let 
 
 
 
 
  Then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Also, 
 
 
 
  is the kernel of 
 
 
 
 , the projection restricted to 
 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, 
 
 
 
 .
The Zassenhaus Algorithm calculates a basis of 
 
 
 
 . In the first 
 
 
 
  columns of this matrix, there is a basis 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 
 .
The rows of the form 
 
 
 
  (with 
 
 
 
 ) are obviously in 
 
 
 
 . Because the matrix is in row echelon form, they also linearly independent. All rows which are different from zero (
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 ) are a basis of 
 
 
 
 , so there are 
 
 
 
  such 
 
 
 
 s. Therefore, the 
 
 
 
 s form a basis of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Consider the two subspaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of the vector space 
 
 
 
 .
Using the standard basis, we create the following matrix of dimension 
 
 
 
 :



Using elementary row operations, we transform this matrix into the following matrix:


 
  (some entries have been replaced by "
 
 
 
 " because they are irrelevant to the result).
Therefore, 
 
 
 
  is a basis of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a basis of 
 
 
 
 .
