Telescoping Markov chain

In probability theory, a telescoping Markov chain (TMC) is a vector-valued stochastic process that satisfies a Markov property and admits a hierarchical format through a network of transition matrices with cascading dependence.
For any 
 
 
 
  consider the set of spaces 
 
 
 
 . The hierarchical process 
 
 
 
  defined in the product-space



is said to be a TMC if there is a set of transition probability kernels 
 
 
 
  such that
(1)

 
  is a Markov chain with transition probability matrix 
 
 




(2) there is a cascading dependence in every level of the hierarchy,


 
      for all 
 
 

(3)

 
  satisfies a Markov property with a transition kernel that can be written in terms of the
