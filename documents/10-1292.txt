   Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ferredoxin)      Glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ferredoxin)   In enzymology , a glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (ferredoxin) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate + H 2 O + 2 oxidized ferredoxin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-phospho-D-glycerate + 2 H + + 2 reduced ferredoxin   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate , H 2 O , and oxidized ferredoxin , whereas its 3 products are 3-phospho-D-glycerate , H + , and reduced ferredoxin.  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate:ferredoxin oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include GAPOR , glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate Fd oxidoreductase , and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate ferredoxin reductase .
