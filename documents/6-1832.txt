   Rankine vortex      Rankine vortex   The Rankine vortex is a type of vortex in a viscous fluid. It is named after its discoverer, William John Macquorn Rankine .  A swirling flow in a viscous fluid can be characterized by a forced vortex in its central core, surrounded by a free vortex . In an inviscid fluid, on the other hand, a swirling flow consists entirely of the free vortex with a singularity at its center point instead of the forced vortex core. The tangential velocity 1 of a Rankine vortex with circulation    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   and radius   R   R   R   is        u  θ    (  r  )    =   {       Γ  r   /   (   2  π   R  2    )        r  ≤  R   ,        Γ  /   (   2  π  r   )        r  >  R   .              subscript  u  θ   r    cases      normal-Γ  r     2  π   superscript  R  2       r  R     normal-Γ    2  π  r      r  R      u_{\theta}(r)=\begin{cases}\Gamma r/(2\pi R^{2})&r\leq R,\\
 \Gamma/(2\pi r)&r>R.\end{cases}     The remainder of the velocity components are identically zero, so that the total velocity field is    𝐮  =     u  θ     𝐞  θ        𝐮     subscript  u  θ    subscript  𝐞  θ      \mathbf{u}=u_{\theta}\ \mathbf{e_{\theta}}   .
