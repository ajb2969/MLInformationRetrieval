   Cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase      Cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   catechol + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are catechol , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-1,2-dihydrobenzene-1,2-diol:NAD+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include cis-benzene glycol dehydrogenase , cis-1,2-dihydrocyclohexa-3,5-diene (nicotinamide adenine , and dinucleotide) oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in 4 metabolic pathways : gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation , toluene and xylene degradation , naphthalene and anthracene degradation , and styrene degradation .
