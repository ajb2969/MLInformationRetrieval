   Funk transform      Funk transform   In the mathematical field of integral geometry , the Funk transform (also called Minkowski–Funk transform , Funk–Radon transform or spherical Radon transform ) is an integral transform defined by integrating a function on great circles of the sphere . It was introduced by Paul Funk in 1916, based on the work of . It is closely related to the Radon transform . The original motivation for studying the Funk transform was to describe Zoll metrics on the sphere.  Definition  Classically, the Funk transform is defined as follows. Let ƒ be a continuous function on the 2-sphere in R 3 . Then, for a unit vector  x , let       F  f   (  𝐱  )    =    ∫   𝐮  ∈   C   (  𝐱  )       f   (  𝐮  )   d  s   (  𝐮  )           F  f  𝐱     subscript     𝐮    C  𝐱       f  𝐮  d  s  𝐮      Ff(\mathbf{x})=\int_{\mathbf{u}\in C(\mathbf{x})}f(\mathbf{u})\,ds(\mathbf{u})     where the integral is carried out with respect to the arclength ds of the great circle C ( x ) consisting of all unit vectors perpendicular to x :        C   (  𝐱  )    =   {   𝐮  ∈   S  2    ∣    𝐮  ⋅  𝐱   =  0   }    .        C  𝐱    conditional-set    𝐮   superscript  S  2       normal-⋅  𝐮  𝐱   0      C(\mathbf{x})=\{\mathbf{u}\in S^{2}\mid\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{x}=0\}.     Inversion  Clearly, the Funk transform annihilates all odd functions , and so it is natural to confine attention to the case when ƒ is even. In that case, the Funk transform takes even (continuous) functions to even continuous functions, and is furthermore invertible.  Spherical harmonics  Every square-integrable function    f  ∈    L  2    (   S  2   )        f     superscript  L  2    superscript  S  2      f\in L^{2}(S^{2})   on the sphere can be decomposed into spherical harmonics       f  =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     ∑   k  =   -  n    n     f  ^    (  n  ,  k  )    Y  n  k       .      f    superscript   subscript     n  0        superscript   subscript     k    n     n      normal-^  f    n  k    superscript   subscript  Y  n   k        f=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=-n}^{n}\hat{f}(n,k)Y_{n}^{k}.     Then the Funk transform of f reads      f  =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     ∑   k  =   -  n    n     P  n    (  0  )    f  ^    (  n  ,  k  )    Y  n  k          f    superscript   subscript     n  0        superscript   subscript     k    n     n      subscript  P  n   0   normal-^  f    n  k    superscript   subscript  Y  n   k        f=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\sum_{k=-n}^{n}P_{n}(0)\hat{f}(n,k)Y_{n}^{k}     where      P    2  n   +  1     (  0  )    =  0         subscript  P      2  n   1    0   0    P_{2n+1}(0)=0   for odd values and        P   2  n     (  0  )    =     (   -  1   )   n       1  ⋅  3  ⋅  5   ⋯  2  n   -  1     2  ⋅  4  ⋅  6   ⋯  2  n            subscript  P    2  n    0      superscript    1   n          normal-⋅  1  3  5   normal-⋯  2  n   1      normal-⋅  2  4  6   normal-⋯  2  n       P_{2n}(0)=(-1)^{n}\frac{1\cdot 3\cdot 5\cdots 2n-1}{2\cdot 4\cdot 6\cdots 2n}   for even values. This result was shown by .  Inversion formula  As with the Radon transform, the inversion formula relies on the dual transform, defined by         (    F  *   f   )    (  p  ,  𝐱  )    =    1   2  π   cos  p       ∫     ∥  𝐮  ∥   =  1   ,    𝐱  ⋅  𝐮   =   sin  p       f   (  𝐮  )    |   d  𝐮   |       .           superscript  F    f    p  𝐱        1    2  π    p       subscript    formulae-sequence     norm  𝐮   1      normal-⋅  𝐱  𝐮     p        f  𝐮      d  𝐮         (F^{*}f)(p,\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2\pi\cos p}\int_{\|\mathbf{u}\|=1,\mathbf{x}%
 \cdot\mathbf{u}=\sin p}f(\mathbf{u})\,|d\mathbf{u}|.     This is the average value of the circle function ƒ over circles of arc distance p from the point x . The inverse transform is given by        f   (  𝐱  )    =    1   2  π      {    d   d  u      ∫  0  u     F  *    (   F  f   )    (    cos   -  1    v   ,  𝐱  )   v     (    u  2   -   v  2    )    -   1  /  2      d  v     }    u  =  1      .        f  𝐱       1    2  π     subscript       d    d  u      superscript   subscript   0   u      superscript  F      F  f      superscript     1    v   𝐱   v   superscript     superscript  u  2    superscript  v  2        1  2     d  v        u  1       f(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\left\{\frac{d}{du}\int_{0}^{u}F^{*}(Ff)(\cos^{-1}%
 v,\mathbf{x})v(u^{2}-v^{2})^{-1/2}\,dv\right\}_{u=1}.     Generalization  The classical formulation is invariant under the rotation group SO(3) . It is also possible to formulate the Funk transform in a manner that makes it invariant under the special linear group SL(3, R ), due to . Suppose that ƒ is a homogeneous function of degree −2 on R 3 . Then, for linearly independent vectors x and y , define a function φ by the line integral       φ   (  𝐱  ,  𝐲  )    =    1   2  π     ∮   f   (    u  𝐱   +   v  𝐲    )    (     u   d  v   -    v   d  u    )            φ   𝐱  𝐲        1    2  π     contour-integral    f      u  𝐱     v  𝐲        u  d  v     v  d  u         \varphi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{2\pi}\oint f(u\mathbf{x}+v\mathbf{y})(%
 u\,dv-v\,du)     taken over a simple closed curve encircling the origin once. The differential form      f   (    u  𝐱   +   v  𝐲    )    (     u   d  v   -    v   d  u    )       f      u  𝐱     v  𝐲        u  d  v     v  d  u      f(u\mathbf{x}+v\mathbf{y})(u\,dv-v\,du)     is closed , which follows by the homogeneity of ƒ . By a change of variables , φ satisfies        ϕ   (    a  𝐱   +   b  𝐲    ,    c  𝐱   +   d  𝐲    )    =    1   |    a  d   -   b  c    |    ϕ   (  𝐱  ,  𝐲  )     ,        ϕ       a  𝐱     b  𝐲        c  𝐱     d  𝐲          1        a  d     b  c      ϕ   𝐱  𝐲      \phi(a\mathbf{x}+b\mathbf{y},c\mathbf{x}+d\mathbf{y})=\frac{1}{|ad-bc|}\phi(%
 \mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}),     and so gives a homogeneous function of degree −1 on the exterior square of R 3 ,        F  f   (   𝐱  ∧  𝐲   )    =   ϕ   (  𝐱  ,  𝐲  )     .        F  f    𝐱  𝐲      ϕ   𝐱  𝐲      Ff(\mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{y})=\phi(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{y}).     The function Fƒ : Λ 2 R 3 → R agrees with the Funk transform when ƒ is the degree −2 homogeneous extension of a function on the sphere and the projective space associated to Λ 2 R 3 is identified with the space of all circles on the sphere. Alternatively, Λ 2 R 3 can be identified with R 3 in an SL(3, R )-invariant manner, and so the Funk transform F maps smooth even homogeneous functions of degree −2 on R 3 \{0} to smooth even homogeneous functions of degree −1 on R 3 \{0}.
