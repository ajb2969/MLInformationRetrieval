Palm–Khintchine theorem

In probability theory, the Palm–Khintchine theorem, the work of Conny Palm and Aleksandr Khinchin, expresses that a large number of not necessarily Poissonian renewal processes combined will have Poissonian properties.1
It is used to generalise the behaviour of users or clients in queuing theory. It is also used in dependability and reliability modelling of computing and telecommunications.
According to Heyman and Sobel (2003), the theorem describes that the superposition of a large number of independent equilibrium renewal processes, each with a small intensity, behaves asymptotically like a Poisson process:
Let 
 
 
 
  be independent renewal processes and 
 
 
 
  be the superposition of these processes. Denote by 
 
 
 
  the time between the first and the second renewal epochs in process 
 
 
 
 . Define
 
 
 
  the 
 
 
 
 th counting process, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
If the following assumptions hold
1) For all sufficiently large 
 
 


2) Given 
 
 
 
 , for every 
 
 
 
  and sufficiently large 
 
 

 
  for all 
 
 

then the superposition 
 
 
 
  of the counting processes approaches a Poisson process for 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
