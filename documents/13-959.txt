   Overring      Overring   In mathematics, an overring  B of an integral domain  A is a subring of the field of fractions  K of A that contains A : i.e.,    A  ⊆  B  ⊆  K        A  B       K     A\subseteq B\subseteq K   . 1 For instance, an overring of the integers is a ring in which all elements are rational numbers , such as the ring of dyadic rationals .  A typical example is given by localization : if S is a multiplicatively closed subset of A , then the localization S −1 A is an overring of A . The rings in which every overring is a localization are said to have the QR property; they include the Bézout domains and are a subset of the Prüfer domains . 2 In particular, every overring of the ring of integers arises in this way; for instance, the dyadic rationals are the localization of the integers by the powers of two .
