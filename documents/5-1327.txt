BK-space

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics, a BK-space or Banach coordinate space is a sequence space endowed with a suitable norm to turn it into a Banach space. All BK-spaces are normable FK-spaces.1
Examples

the space of convergent sequences

 
 , the space of null sequences

 
  and the space of bounded sequences

 
  under the supremum norm

2
the space of absolutely p-summable sequences

 
  with 
 
 
 
  and the norm
