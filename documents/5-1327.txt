   BK-space      BK-space   In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics , a BK-space or Banach coordinate space is a sequence space endowed with a suitable norm to turn it into a Banach space . All BK-spaces are normable FK-spaces . 1  Examples   the space of convergent sequences    c   c   c   , the space of null sequences     c  0     subscript  c  0    c_{0}   and the space of bounded sequences     l  ∞     superscript  l     l^{\infty}   under the supremum norm     ∥  ⋅   ∥  ∞      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to      \|\cdot\|_{\infty}    2  the space of absolutely p-summable sequences     l  p     superscript  l  p    l^{p}   with    p  ≥  1      p  1    p\geq 1   and the norm    ∥  ⋅   ∥  p      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to  p     \|\cdot\|_{p}    3   References  "  Category:Banach spaces     . ↩
