Ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase

In enzymology, an ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CTP + ethanolamine phosphate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + CDP-ethanolamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CTP and ethanolamine phosphate, whereas its two products are diphosphate and CDP-ethanolamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is CTP:ethanolamine-phosphate cytidylyltransferase. Other names in common use include phosphorylethanolamine transferase, ET, CTP-phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, phosphoethanolamine cytidylyltransferase, and ethanolamine phosphate cytidylyltransferase. This enzyme participates in aminophosphonate metabolism and glycerophospholipid metabolism.
