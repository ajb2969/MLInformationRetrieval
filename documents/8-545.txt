   Epigraph (mathematics)      Epigraph (mathematics)   In mathematics , the epigraph or supergraph 1 of a function  f : R n → R is the set of points lying on or above its graph :        epi  f   =   {   (  x  ,  μ  )   :    x  ∈   ℝ  n    ,    μ  ∈  ℝ   ,   μ  ≥   f   (  x  )       }   ⊆   ℝ   n  +  1     .          epi  f    conditional-set   x  μ    formulae-sequence    x   superscript  ℝ  n     formulae-sequence    μ  ℝ     μ    f  x             superscript  ℝ    n  1       \mbox{epi}f=\{(x,\mu)\,:\,x\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\,\mu\in\mathbb{R},\,\mu\geq f(x)%
 \}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n+1}.     The strict epigraph is the epigraph with the graph itself removed:         epi  S   f   =   {   (  x  ,  μ  )   :    x  ∈   ℝ  n    ,    μ  ∈  ℝ   ,   μ  >   f   (  x  )       }   ⊆   ℝ   n  +  1     .           subscript  epi  S   f    conditional-set   x  μ    formulae-sequence    x   superscript  ℝ  n     formulae-sequence    μ  ℝ     μ    f  x             superscript  ℝ    n  1       \mbox{epi}_{S}f=\{(x,\mu)\,:\,x\in\mathbb{R}^{n},\,\mu\in\mathbb{R},\,\mu>f(x)%
 \}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n+1}.     The same definitions are valid for a function that takes values in R ∪ ∞. In this case, the epigraph is empty if and only if f is identically equal to infinity.  The domain (rather than the co-domain) of the function is not particularly important for this definition; it can be any linear space 2 or even an arbitrary set 3 instead of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   .  Similarly, the set of points on or below the function is its hypograph .  Properties  A function is convex if and only if its epigraph is a convex set . The epigraph of a real affine function  g : R n → R is a halfspace in R n+1 .  A function is lower semicontinuous if and only if its epigraph is closed .
