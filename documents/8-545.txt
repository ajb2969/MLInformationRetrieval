Epigraph (mathematics)

 In mathematics, the epigraph or supergraph1 of a function f : Rn→R is the set of points lying on or above its graph:



The strict epigraph is the epigraph with the graph itself removed:



The same definitions are valid for a function that takes values in R ∪ ∞. In this case, the epigraph is empty if and only if f is identically equal to infinity.
The domain (rather than the co-domain) of the function is not particularly important for this definition; it can be any linear space2 or even an arbitrary set3 instead of 
 
 
 
 .
Similarly, the set of points on or below the function is its hypograph.
Properties
A function is convex if and only if its epigraph is a convex set. The epigraph of a real affine function g : Rn→R is a halfspace in Rn+1.
A function is lower semicontinuous if and only if its epigraph is closed.
