A HIGH output (1) results only if both the inputs to the AND gate are HIGH (1). If neither or only one input to the AND gate is HIGH, a LOW output results. In another sense, the function of AND effectively finds the minimum between two binary digits, just as the OR function finds the maximum . Therefore, the output is always 0 except when all the inputs are 1s.  Symbols  There are three symbols for AND gates: the American ( ANSI or 'military') symbol and the IEC ('European' or 'rectangular') symbol, as well as the deprecated DIN symbol.

Implementations     (Figure)  NMOS AND gate   (Figure)  AND gate using diodes    (Figure)  AND gate using transistors      An AND gate is usually designed using N-channel (pictured) or P-channel MOSFETs . The digital inputs a and b cause the output F to have the same result as the AND function.  Alternatives  If no specific AND gates are available, one can be made from NAND or NOR gates, because NAND and NOR gates are considered the "universal gates," 1 meaning that they can be used to make all the others.
