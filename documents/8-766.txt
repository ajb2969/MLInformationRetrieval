Steryl-sulfatase

Steryl-sulfatase (, arylsulfatase, steroid sulfatase, sterol sulfatase, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate sulfatase, arylsulfatase C, steroid 3-sulfatase, steroid sulfate sulfohydrolase, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfatase, pregnenolone sulfatase, phenolic steroid sulfatase, 3-beta-hydroxysteroid sulfate sulfatase) is an enzyme with system name steryl-sulfate sulfohydrolase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction
