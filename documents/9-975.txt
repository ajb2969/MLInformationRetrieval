6-simplex

In geometry, a 6-simplex is a self-dual regular 6-polytope. It has 7 vertices, 21 edges, 35 triangle faces, 35 tetrahedral cells, 21 5-cell 4-faces, and 7 5-simplex 5-faces. Its dihedral angle is cos−1(1/6), or approximately 80.41°.
Alternate names
It can also be called a heptapeton, or hepta-6-tope, as a 7-facetted polytope in 6-dimensions. The name heptapeton is derived from hepta for seven facets in Greek and -peta for having five-dimensional facets, and -on. Jonathan Bowers gives a heptapeton the acronym hop.1
Coordinates
The Cartesian coordinates for an origin-centered regular heptapeton having edge length 2 are:


















The vertices of the 6-simplex can be more simply positioned in 7-space as permutations of:

(0,0,0,0,0,0,1)
 

This construction is based on facets of the 7-orthoplex.
