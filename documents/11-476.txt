   Dolichylphosphate-mannose phosphodiesterase      Dolichylphosphate-mannose phosphodiesterase   In enzymology , a dolichylphosphate-mannose phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dolichyl beta-D-mannosyl phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dolichyl phosphate + D-mannose   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl beta-D-mannosyl phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dolichyl phosphate and D-mannose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dolichyl-beta-D-mannosyl-phosphate dolichylphosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called mannosylphosphodolichol phosphodiesterase .
