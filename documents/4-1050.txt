   Nonagonal number      Nonagonal number   A nonagonal number is a figurate number that extends the concept of triangular and square numbers to the nonagon (a nine-sided polygon). However, unlike the triangular and square numbers, the patterns involved in the construction of nonagonal numbers are not rotationally symmetrical. Specifically, the n th nonagonal numbers counts the number of dots in a pattern of n nested nonagons, all sharing a common corner, where the i th nonagon in the pattern has sides made of i dots spaced one unit apart from each other. The nonagonal number for n is given by the formula:        n   (    7  n   -  5   )    2   .        n      7  n   5    2    \frac{n(7n-5)}{2}.     The first few nonagonal numbers are:   1 , 9 , 24 , 46 , 75 , 111 , 154 , 204 , 261, 325, 396, 474, 559, 651, 750, 856, 969, 1089 , 1216, 1350, 1491, 1639, 1794, 1956, 2125, 2301, 2484, 2674, 2871, 3075, 3286, 3504, 3729, 3961, 4200, 4446, 4699, 4959, 5226, 5500, 5781, 6069, 6364, 6666, 6975, 7291, 7614, 7944, 8281, 8625, 8976, 9334, 9699.   The parity of nonagonal numbers follows the pattern odd-odd-even-even.  Letting N(n) give the n th nonagonal number and T(n) the n th triangular number,         7  N   (  n  )    +  3   =   T   (    7  n   -  3   )     .          7  N  n   3     T      7  n   3      {7N(n)+3=T(7n-3)}.     Test for nonagonal numbers       x  =       56  n   +  25    +  5   14    .      x            56  n   25    5   14     x=\frac{\sqrt{56n+25}+5}{14}.   If x is an integer, then n is the xth nonagonal number. If x is not an integer, then n is not nonagonal.  "  Category:Figurate numbers
