NAD(P)+ nucleosidase

In enzymology, a NAD(P)+ nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

NAD(P)+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  ADP-ribose(P) + nicotinamide
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NAD+, NADP+, and H2O, whereas its two products are ADP-ribose and nicotinamide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NAD(P)+ glycohydrolase. Other names in common use include nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) nucleosidase, triphosphopyridine nucleotidase, NAD(P) nucleosidase, NAD(P)ase, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) glycohydrolase. This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.
