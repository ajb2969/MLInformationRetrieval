   Scalar electrodynamics      Scalar electrodynamics   In theoretical physics , scalar electrodynamics is a theory of a U(1) gauge field coupled to a charged spin 0 scalar field that takes the place of the Dirac fermions in "ordinary" quantum electrodynamics . The scalar field is charged, and with an appropriate potential, it has the capacity to break the gauge symmetry via the Abelian Higgs mechanism .  The model consists of a complex scalar field    ϕ   (  x  )       ϕ  x    \phi(x)   minimally coupled to a gauge field     A  μ    (  x  )        subscript  A  μ   x    A_{\mu}(x)   . The dynamics is given by the Lagrangian density       ℒ  =      (    D  μ   ϕ   )   *    D  μ   ϕ   -   U   (    ϕ  *   ϕ   )    -    1  4    F   μ  ν      F   μ  ν        ,      ℒ       superscript     subscript  D  μ   ϕ      superscript  D  μ   ϕ     U     superscript  ϕ    ϕ        1  4    subscript  F    μ  ν     superscript  F    μ  ν        \mathcal{L}=(D_{\mu}\phi)^{*}D^{\mu}\phi-U(\phi^{*}\phi)-\frac{1}{4}F_{\mu\nu}%
 F^{\mu\nu}\ ,     where     F   μ  ν    =   (     ∂  μ    A  ν    -    ∂  ν    A  μ     )        subscript  F    μ  ν        subscript   μ    subscript  A  ν      subscript   ν    subscript  A  μ       F_{\mu\nu}=(\partial_{\mu}A_{\nu}-\partial_{\nu}A_{\mu})   is the electromagnetic field strength,      D  μ   ϕ   =   (     ∂  μ   ϕ   -   i  e   A  μ   ϕ    )          subscript  D  μ   ϕ       subscript   μ   ϕ     i  e   subscript  A  μ   ϕ      D_{\mu}\phi=(\partial_{\mu}\phi-ieA_{\mu}\phi)   is the covariant derivative of the field   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   ,   e   e   e   is the electric charge and    U   (    ϕ  *   ϕ   )       U     superscript  ϕ    ϕ     U(\phi^{*}\phi)   is the potential for the complex scalar field. This model is invariant under gauge transformations parametrized by    λ   (  x  )       λ  x    \lambda(x)           ϕ  ′    (  x  )    =     e   i  e  λ   (  x  )     ϕ   (  x  )    and       A  μ  ′    (  x  )    =     A  μ    (  x  )    +     ∂  μ   λ    (  x  )       .     formulae-sequence       superscript  ϕ  normal-′   x       superscript  e    i  e  λ  x    ϕ  x   and         superscript   subscript  A  μ   normal-′   x        subscript  A  μ   x       subscript   μ   λ   x       \phi^{\prime}(x)=e^{ie\lambda(x)}\phi(x)\quad\textrm{and}\quad A_{\mu}^{\prime%
 }(x)=A_{\mu}(x)+\partial_{\mu}\lambda(x)\ .     If the potential is such that its minimum occurs at non-zero value of    |  ϕ  |      ϕ    |\phi|   , this model exhibits the Higgs mechanism . This can be seen by studying fluctuations about the lowest energy configuration, one sees that gauge field behaves as a massive field with its mass proportional to the   e   e   e   times the minimum value of    |  ϕ  |      ϕ    |\phi|   . As shown in 1973 by Nielsen and Olesen, this model, in    2  +  1      2  1    2+1   dimensions, admits time-independent finite energy configurations corresponding to vortices carrying magnetic flux. The magnetic flux carried by these vortices are quantized (in units of     2  π   e        2  π   e    \tfrac{2\pi}{e}   ) and appears as a topological charge associated with the topological current        J   t  o  p   μ   =    ϵ   μ  ν  ρ      F   ν  ρ       .       superscript   subscript  J    t  o  p    μ      superscript  ϵ    μ  ν  ρ     subscript  F    ν  ρ       J_{top}^{\mu}=\epsilon^{\mu\nu\rho}F_{\nu\rho}\ .     These vortices are similar to the vortices appearing in type-II superconductors. This analogy was used by Nielsen and Olesen in obtaining their solutions.
