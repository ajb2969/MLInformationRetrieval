   Quantum q-Krawtchouk polynomials      Quantum q-Krawtchouk polynomials   In mathematics, the quantum q -Krawtchouk polynomials are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme .  give a detailed list of their properties.  Definition  The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by  $$\displaystyle$$  Orthogonality  Recurrence and difference relations  Rodrigues formula  Generating function  Relation to other polynomials  References       "  Category:Orthogonal polynomials  Category:Q-analogs  Category:Special hypergeometric functions
