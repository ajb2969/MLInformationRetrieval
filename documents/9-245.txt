Sylvester's formula

In matrix theory, Sylvester's formula or Sylvester's matrix theorem (named after J. J. Sylvester) or Lagrange−Sylvester interpolation expresses an analytic function

 
  of a matrix

 
  as a polynomial in 
 
 
 
 , in terms of the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of 
 
 
 
 
 .

1 It states that








where the  are the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 , and the matrices 
 
 
i are the corresponding Frobenius covariants of 
 
 
 
 , which are (projection) matrix Lagrange polynomials of 
 
 
 
 
 .
Sylvester's formula (1883) is only valid for diagonalizable matrices; an extension due to A. Buchheim (1886) covers the general case.
Conditions
Sylvester's formula applies for any diagonalizable matrix

 
  with 
 
 
 
  distinct eigenvalues, 
 
 
1, …, λk, and any function 
 
 
 
  defined on some subset of the complex numbers such that 
 
 
 
 
  is well defined. The last condition means that every eigenvalue  is in the domain of 
 
 
 
 , and that every eigenvalue  with multiplicity 
 
 
i > 1 is in the interior of the domain, with 
 
 
 
  being () times differentiable at .2
Example
Consider the two-by-two matrix:



This matrix has two eigenvalues, 5 and −2. Its Frobenius covariants are



Sylvester's formula then amounts to



For instance, if 
 
 
 
  is defined by  x−1}}, then Sylvester's formula expresses the matrix inverse  A−1}} as
