Kaprekar number

In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, because 45² = 2025 and 20+25 = 45. The Kaprekar numbers are named after D. R. Kaprekar.
Definition
Let X be a non-negative integer. X is a Kaprekar number for base b if there exist non-negative integers n, A, and positive number B satisfying:

X² = Abn + B, where 0 n''
 
X = A + B


Note that X is also a Kaprekar number for base bn, for this specific choice of n. More narrowly, we can define the set K(N) for a given integer N as the set of integers X for which1

X² = AN + B, where 0 < B < N

X = A + B


Each Kaprekar number X for base b is then counted in one of the sets K(b), K(b²), K(b³),….
Examples
297 is a Kaprekar number for base 10, because 297² = 88209, which can be split into 88 and 209, and 88 + 209 = 297. By convention, the second part may start with the digit 0, but must be nonzero. For example, 999 is a Kaprekar number for base 10, because 999² = 998001, which can be split into 998 and 001, and 998 + 001 = 999. But 100 is not; although 100² = 10000 and 100 + 00 = 100, the second part here is zero.
The first few Kaprekar numbers in base 10 are:

1, 9, 45, 55, 99, 297, 703, 999, 2223, 2728, 4879, 4950, 5050, 5292, 7272, 7777, 9999, 17344, 22222, 38962, 77778, 82656, 95121, 99999, 142857, 148149, 181819, 187110, 208495, 318682, 329967, 351352, 356643, 390313, 461539, 466830, 499500, 500500, 533170, ... 
 

In particular, 9, 99, 999… are all Kaprekar numbers. More generally, for any base b, there exist infinitely many Kaprekar numbers, including all numbers of the form bn - 1. Most Kaprekar numbers repeats digits.
The first few Kaprekar numbers are odd numbers.
Properties

It was shown in 20002 that the Kaprekar numbers for base b are in bijection with the unitary divisors of bn − 1, in the following sense. Let Inv(a,b) denote the multiplicative inverse of a modulo b, namely the least positive integer m such that 
 
 
 
 . Then, a number X is in the set K(N) (defined above) if and only if X = d Inv(d, (N-1)/d) for some unitary divisor d of N-1. In particular,
 
For each X in K(N), N - X is in K(N).
In binary, all even perfect numbers are Kaprekar numbers.
