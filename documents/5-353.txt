   Ihara zeta function      Ihara zeta function   In mathematics , the Ihara zeta-function is a zeta function associated with a finite graph . It closely resembles the Selberg zeta-function , and is used to relate closed paths to the spectrum of the adjacency matrix . The Ihara zeta-function was first defined by Yasutaka Ihara in the 1960s in the context of discrete subgroups of the two-by-two p-adic  special linear group . Jean-Pierre Serre suggested in his book Trees that Ihara's original definition can be reinterpreted graph-theoretically. It was Toshikazu Sunada who put this suggestion into practice (1985). As observed by Sunada, a regular graph is a Ramanujan graph if and only if its Ihara zeta function satisfies an analogue of the Riemann hypothesis . 1  Definition  The Ihara zeta-function can be defined by a formula analogous to the Euler product for the Riemann zeta function :       1    ζ  G    (  u  )     =    ∏  p    (   1  -   u   L   (  p  )      )          1     subscript  ζ  G   u      subscript  product  p     1   superscript  u    L  p        \frac{1}{\zeta_{G}(u)}=\prod_{p}({1-u^{L(p)}})     This product is taken over all prime walks p of the graph    G  =   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G=(V,E)   - that is, closed cycles    p  =   (   u  0   ,  ⋯  ,   u    L   (  p  )    -  1    ,   u  0   )       p    subscript  u  0   normal-⋯   subscript  u      L  p   1     subscript  u  0      p=(u_{0},\cdots,u_{L(p)-1},u_{0})   such that         (   u  i   ,   u    (   i  +  1   )   mod   L   (  p  )      )   ∈   E    ;    u  i   ≠   u    (   i  +  2   )   mod   L   (  p  )        ,     formulae-sequence      subscript  u  i    subscript  u   modulo    i  1     L  p      E      subscript  u  i    subscript  u   modulo    i  2     L  p        (u_{i},u_{(i+1)\bmod L(p)})\in E~{};\quad u_{i}\neq u_{(i+2)\bmod L(p)~{}},     and    L   (  p  )       L  p    L(p)   is the length of cycle p , as used in the formulae above. 2 This formulation in graph-theoretic setting is due to Sunada.  Ihara's formula  Ihara (and Sunada in the graph-theoretic setting) showed that for regular graphs the zeta function is a rational function. If G is k -regular with adjacency matrix  A then 3        ζ  G    (  u  )    =   1     (   1  -   u  2    )     χ   (  G  )    -  1     det   (    I  -   A  u    +    (   k  -  1   )    u  2   I    )             subscript  ζ  G   u     1     superscript    1   superscript  u  2        χ  G   1          I    A  u        k  1    superscript  u  2   I         \zeta_{G}(u)=\frac{1}{(1-u^{2})^{\chi(G)-1}\det(I-Au+(k-1)u^{2}I)}     where χ is the circuit rank .  The Ihara zeta-function is in fact always the reciprocal of a polynomial:         ζ  G    (  u  )    =    1   det   (   I  -   T  u    )       ,         subscript  ζ  G   u     1      I    T  u        \zeta_{G}(u)=\frac{1}{\det(I-Tu)}~{},     where T is Hashimoto's edge adjacency operator. Hyman Bass gave a determinant formula involving the adjacency operator.  Applications  The Ihara zeta function plays an important role in the study of free groups , spectral graph theory , and dynamical systems , especially symbolic dynamics , where the Ihara zeta function is an example of a Ruelle zeta function . 4  References          "  Category:Zeta and L-functions  Category:Algebraic graph theory     Terras (1999) p.678 ↩  Terras (2010) p.12 ↩  Terras (1999) p.677 ↩  Terras (2010) p.29 ↩
