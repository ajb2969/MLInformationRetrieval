Agmatine kinase

In enzymology, an agmatine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + agmatine 
 
 
 
  ADP + N4-phosphoagmatine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and agmatine, whereas its two products are ADP and N4-phosphoagmatine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a nitrogenous group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:agmatine N4-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include phosphagen phosphokinase, and ATP:agmatine 4-N-phosphotransferase.
