   Constant (mathematics)      Constant (mathematics)   In mathematics , the adjective constant means non-varying. The noun constant may have two different meanings. It may refer to a fixed and well defined number or other mathematical object . The term mathematical constant (and also physical constant ) is sometimes used to distinguish this meaning from the other one. A constant may also refer to a constant function or its value (it is a common usage to identify them). Such a constant is commonly represented by a variable which does not depend on the main variable(s) of the studied problem. This is the case, for example, for a constant of integration which is an arbitrary constant function (not depending on the variable of integration) added to a particular antiderivative to get all the antiderivatives of the given function.  For example, a general quadratic function is commonly written as:        a   x  2    +   b  x   +   c    ,        a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c    ax^{2}+bx+c\,,     where a , b and c are constants (or parameters), while x is the variable, a placeholder for the argument of the function being studied. A more explicit way to denote this function is       x  ↦    a   x  2    +   b  x   +   c     ,     maps-to  x      a   superscript  x  2      b  x   c     x\mapsto ax^{2}+bx+c\,,     which makes the function-argument status of x clear, and thereby implicitly the constant status of a , b and c . In this example a , b and c are coefficients of the polynomial. Since c occurs in a term that does not involve x , it is called the constant term of the polynomial and can be thought of as the coefficient of x 0 ; any polynomial term or expression of degree zero is a constant. 1  Constant function  A constant may be used to define a constant function that ignores its arguments and always gives the same value. A constant function of a single variable, such as     f   (  x  )    =  5        f  x   5    f(x)=5   , has a graph that is a horizontal straight line, parallel to the x-axis. Such a function always takes the same value (in this case, 5) because its argument does not appear in the expression defining the function.  Context-dependence  The context-dependent nature of the concept of "constant" can be seen in this example from elementary calculus:          d   d  x     2  x        =    lim   h  →  0       2   x  +  h    -   2  x    h         =    lim   h  →  0      2  x      2  h   -  1   h             =    2  x     lim   h  →  0       2  h   -  1   h         since  x  is constant (i.e. does not depend on  h  )           =    2  x   ⋅  𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭    ,       where  𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭  means not depending on  x   .             d    d  x     superscript  2  x      absent    subscript    normal-→  h  0         superscript  2    x  h     superscript  2  x    h       absent    subscript    normal-→  h  0       superscript  2  x        superscript  2  h   1   h         missing-subexpression     absent     superscript  2  x     subscript    normal-→  h  0         superscript  2  h   1   h        since  x  is constant (i.e. does not depend on  h  )      missing-subexpression     absent   normal-⋅   superscript  2  x   𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭      where  𝐜𝐨𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐚𝐧𝐭  means not depending on  x      \begin{array}[]{lll}\frac{d}{dx}2^{x}&=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2^{x+h}-2^{x}}{h}&=%
 \lim_{h\to 0}2^{x}\frac{2^{h}-1}{h}\\
 &=2^{x}\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{2^{h}-1}{h}&\text{since }x\text{ is constant (i.e. %
 does not depend on }h\text{)}\\
 &=2^{x}\cdot\mathbf{constant,}&\text{ where }\mathbf{constant}\text{ means not%
  depending on }x.\end{array}   "Constant" means not depending on some variable; not changing as that variable changes. In the first case above, it means not depending on h ; in the second, it means not depending on x .  Notable mathematical constants  Some values occur frequently in mathematics and are conventionally denoted by a specific symbol. These standard symbols and their values are called mathematical constants. Examples include:   0 ( zero ) .  1 ( one ) , the natural number after zero.  π ( pi ) , the constant representing the ratio of a circle's circumference to its diameter, approximately equal to 3.141592653589793238462643... 2  e , approximately equal to 2.718281828459045235360287...  i , the imaginary unit such that i 2 = -1.      2      2    \sqrt{2}   ( square root of 2 ) , the length of the diagonal of a square with unit sides, approximately equal to 1.414213562373095048801688.  φ ( golden ratio ) , approximately equal to 1.618033988749894848204586, or algebraically,     1  +   5    2        1    5    2    1+\sqrt{5}\over 2   .   Constants in calculus  In calculus , constants are treated in several different ways depending on the operation. For example, the derivative of a constant function is zero. This is because the derivative measures the rate of change of a function with respect to a variable, and since constants, by definition, do not change, their derivative is therefore zero. Conversely, when integrating a constant function, the constant is multiplied by the variable of integration. During the evaluation of a limit , the constant remains the same as it was before and after evaluation.  Integration of a function of one variable often involves a constant of integration . This arises because of the integral operator's nature as the inverse of the differential operator , meaning the aim of integration is to recover the original function before differentiation. The differential of a constant function is zero, as noted above, and the differential operator is a linear operator, so functions that only differ by a constant term have the same derivative. To acknowledge this, a constant of integration is added to an indefinite integral ; this ensures that all possible solutions are included. The constant of integration is generally written as 'c' and represents a constant with a fixed but undefined value.  Examples       f   (  x  )    =  72  ⇒    f  ′    (  x  )    =  0          f  x   72    normal-⇒       superscript  f  normal-′   x        0     f(x)=72\Rightarrow f^{\prime}(x)=0         f   (  x  )    =  72  ⇒   ∫    72   d  x    =    72  x   +  c           f  x   72    normal-⇒        72  d  x             72  x   c      f(x)=72\Rightarrow\int 72\,dx=72x+c         f   (  x  )    =  72  ⇒    lim   x  →  ∞    72   =  72          f  x   72    normal-⇒      subscript    normal-→  x     72        72     f(x)=72\Rightarrow\lim_{x\to\infty}72=72     See also   Expression  Physical constant  Constant (disambiguation)   References  "  Category:Algebra  Category:Elementary mathematics     ↩  ↩
