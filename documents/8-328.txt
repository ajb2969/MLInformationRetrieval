   T-stage      T-stage   T-stage s, sometimes called booster stages, are mounted on the low pressure (LP) shaft of some turbofan engines directly behind the fan. 1  T-stages are used to increase overall pressure ratio and, for a given core size , the core mass flow. This is demonstrated by the following relationship:        w  2   =   (   w  2     T  3    /   P  3   )   )  *  (   P  3   /   P  2   )  *  (   P  2   /   P  1   )  *  (   P  1   /    T  1    )  /  (     T  3   /   T  2     *     T  2   /   T  1     )  ,     fragments   subscript  w  2     fragments  normal-(   subscript  w  2      subscript  T  3      subscript  P  3   normal-)   normal-)   normal-(   subscript  P  3     subscript  P  2   normal-)   normal-(   subscript  P  2     subscript  P  1   normal-)   normal-(   subscript  P  1       subscript  T  1    normal-)   normal-(       subscript  T  3    subscript  T  2           subscript  T  2    subscript  T  1     normal-)  normal-,    w_{2}=(w_{2}\sqrt{T_{3}}/P_{3}))*(P_{3}/P_{2})*(P_{2}/P_{1})*(P_{1}/\sqrt{T_{1%
 }})/(\sqrt{T_{3}/T_{2}}*\sqrt{T_{2}/T_{1}}),        where:    hp compressor entry mass flow =      w  2      subscript  w  2    w_{2}\,        core size =     (     w  2     T  3     /   P  3    )         subscript  w  2      subscript  T  3      subscript  P  3     (w_{2}\sqrt{T_{3}}/P_{3})\,        hp compressor total head pressure ratio =      P  3   /    P  2         subscript  P  3    subscript  P  2     P_{3}/P_{2}\,        lp compressor total head pressure ratio =      P  2   /    P  1         subscript  P  2    subscript  P  1     P_{2}/P_{1}\,        lp compressor entry total pressure =      P  1      subscript  P  1    P_{1}\,        lp compressor entry total temperature =      T  1      subscript  T  1    T_{1}\,        hp compressor total head temperature ratio =      T  3   /    T  2         subscript  T  3    subscript  T  2     T_{3}/T_{2}\,    \, '''     lp compressor total head temperature ratio =      T  2   /    T  1         subscript  T  2    subscript  T  1     T_{2}/T_{1}\,    which varies more slowly than      P  2   /    P  1         subscript  P  2    subscript  P  1     P_{2}/P_{1}\,       So as      P  2   /    P  1         subscript  P  2    subscript  P  1     P_{2}/P_{1}\,    increases with the addition of T-stages,      w  2      subscript  w  2    w_{2}\,    also increases.  T-stages are a popular method for uprating the thrust of an engine (see, for example the Pratt & Whitney Canada PW500 ).  The alternative is to place a zero-stage , mounted on the HP shaft, at the front of the HP compressor. This approach requires a significant change in the HP turbine, whereas a T-stage can, if necessary, be accommodated by simply adding another stage to the rear of the LP turbine.  Although T-stages usually only supercharge the core stream, some engines do feature a deliberately oversized intermediate pressure (IP) compressor, which compresses both the core flow and a proportion of the bypass flow. This enhances the stability of the T-stages during throttling. Where necessary, the alternative is to employ blow-off valves.
