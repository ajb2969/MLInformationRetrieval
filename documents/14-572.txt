   Kazamaki's condition      Kazamaki's condition   In mathematics Kazamaki's condition gives a sufficient criterion ensuring that the Doléans-Dade exponential of a local martingale is a true martingale . This is particularly important if Girsanov's theorem is to be applied to perform a change of measure . Kazamaki's condition is more general than Novikov's condition .  Statement of Kazamaki's condition  Let    M  =    (   M  t   )    t  ≥  0        M   subscript   subscript  M  t     t  0      M=(M_{t})_{t\geq 0}   be a continuous local martingale with respect to a right-continuous filtration      (   ℱ  t   )    t  ≥  0      subscript   subscript  ℱ  t     t  0     (\mathcal{F}_{t})_{t\geq 0}   . If     (   exp   (    M  t   /  2   )    )    t  ≥  0      subscript       subscript  M  t   2      t  0     (\exp(M_{t}/2))_{t\geq 0}   is a uniformly integrable submartingale, then the Doléans-Dade exponential ( M ) of M is a uniformly integrable martingale.
