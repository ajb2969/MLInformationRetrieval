   Skorokhod's embedding theorem      Skorokhod's embedding theorem   In mathematics and probability theory , Skorokhod's embedding theorem is either or both of two theorems that allow one to regard any suitable collection of random variables as a Wiener process ( Brownian motion ) evaluated at a collection of stopping times . Both results are named for the Ukrainian  mathematician  A.V. Skorokhod .  Skorokhod's first embedding theorem  Let X be a real -valued random variable with expected value 0 and finite  variance ; let W denote a canonical real-valued Wiener process. Then there is a stopping time (with respect to the natural filtration of W ), τ , such that W τ has the same distribution as X ,       𝔼   [  τ  ]    =   𝔼   [   X  2   ]          𝔼   delimited-[]  τ      𝔼   delimited-[]   superscript  X  2       \mathbb{E}[\tau]=\mathbb{E}[X^{2}]     and        𝔼   [   τ  2   ]    ≤   4  𝔼   [   X  4   ]     .        𝔼   delimited-[]   superscript  τ  2       4  𝔼   delimited-[]   superscript  X  4       \mathbb{E}[\tau^{2}]\leq 4\mathbb{E}[X^{4}].     Skorokhod's second embedding theorem  Let X 1 , X 2 , ... be a sequence of independent and identically distributed random variables , each with expected value 0 and finite variance, and let        S  n   =    X  1   +  ⋯  +   X  n     .       subscript  S  n      subscript  X  1   normal-⋯   subscript  X  n      S_{n}=X_{1}+\cdots+X_{n}.     Then there is a sequence of stopping times τ 1 ≤ τ 2 ≤ ... such that the    W   τ  n      subscript  W   subscript  τ  n     W_{\tau_{n}}   have the same joint distributions as the partial sums S n and τ 1 , τ 2 − τ 1 , τ 3 − τ 2 , ... are independent and identically distributed random variables satisfying       𝔼   [    τ  n   -   τ   n  -  1     ]    =   𝔼   [   X  1  2   ]          𝔼   delimited-[]     subscript  τ  n    subscript  τ    n  1         𝔼   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  X  1   2       \mathbb{E}[\tau_{n}-\tau_{n-1}]=\mathbb{E}[X_{1}^{2}]     and        𝔼   [    (    τ  n   -   τ   n  -  1     )   2   ]    ≤   4  𝔼   [   X  1  4   ]     .        𝔼   delimited-[]   superscript     subscript  τ  n    subscript  τ    n  1     2       4  𝔼   delimited-[]   superscript   subscript  X  1   4       \mathbb{E}[(\tau_{n}-\tau_{n-1})^{2}]\leq 4\mathbb{E}[X_{1}^{4}].
