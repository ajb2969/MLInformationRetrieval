In functional analysis, a branch of mathematics, the Favard operators are defined by:



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .1 They are named after Jean Favard.
Generalizations
A common generalization is:



where 
 
 
 
  is a positive sequence that converges to 0.2 This reduces to the classical Favard operators when 
 
 
 
 .

This paper also discussed Szász–Mirakyan operators, which is why Favard is sometimes credited with their development (e.g. Favard–Szász operators).
