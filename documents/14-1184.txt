   Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem      Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem   The Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem is often called the second theorem in extreme value theory . It gives the asymptotic tail distribution of a random variable  X , when the true distribution F of X is unknown. Unlike the first theorem (the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem ) in extreme value theory, the interest here is the values above a threshold.  Conditional excess distribution function  If we consider an unknown distribution function   F   F   F   of a random variable   X   X   X   , we are interested in estimating the conditional distribution function    F  u     subscript  F  u    F_{u}   of the variable   X   X   X   above a certain threshold   u   u   u   . This is the so-called conditional excess distribution function, defined as       F  u    (  y  )   =  P   (  X  -  u  ≤  y  |  X  >  u  )   =      F   (   u  +  y   )    -   F   (  u  )      1  -   F   (  u  )          fragments   subscript  F  u    fragments  normal-(  y  normal-)    P   fragments  normal-(  X   u   y  normal-|  X   u  normal-)          F    u  y      F  u      1    F  u       F_{u}(y)=P(X-u\leq y|X>u)=\frac{F(u+y)-F(u)}{1-F(u)}\,     for    0  ≤  y  ≤    x  F   -  u         0  y          subscript  x  F   u      0\leq y\leq x_{F}-u   , where    x  F     subscript  x  F    x_{F}   is either the finite or infinite right endpoint of the underlying distribution   F   F   F   . The function    F  u     subscript  F  u    F_{u}   describes the distribution of the excess value over a threshold   u   u   u   , given that the threshold is exceeded.  Statement  Let    (   X  1   ,   X  2   ,  …  )      subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2   normal-…    (X_{1},X_{2},\ldots)   be a sequence of independent and identically-distributed random variables , and let    F  u     subscript  F  u    F_{u}   be their conditional excess distribution function. Pickands (1975), Balkema and de Haan (1974) posed that for a large class of underlying distribution functions   F   F   F   , and large   u   u   u   ,    F  u     subscript  F  u    F_{u}   is well approximated by the generalized Pareto distribution . That is:         F  u    (  y  )    →    G   k  ,  σ     (  y  )     ,    as  u   →  ∞      formulae-sequence   normal-→     subscript  F  u   y      subscript  G   k  σ    y     normal-→    as  u       F_{u}(y)\rightarrow G_{k,\sigma}(y),\text{ as }u\rightarrow\infty     where         G   k  ,  σ     (  y  )    =   1  -    (   1  +    k  y   /  σ    )    -   1  /  k             subscript  G   k  σ    y     1   superscript    1      k  y   σ        1  k        G_{k,\sigma}(y)=1-(1+ky/\sigma)^{-1/k}   , if    k  ≠  0      k  0    k\neq 0           G   k  ,  σ     (  y  )    =   1  -   e   -   y  /  σ             subscript  G   k  σ    y     1   superscript  e      y  σ        G_{k,\sigma}(y)=1-e^{-y/\sigma}   , if    k  =  0.      k  0.    k=0.      Here σ > 0, and y ≥ 0 when k ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ y ≤ − σ / k when k \sigma, if k = 0.   Uniform distribution on    [  0  ,  σ  ]     0  σ    [0,\sigma]   , if k = -1.  Pareto distribution , if k < 0.
