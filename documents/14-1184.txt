Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem

The Pickands–Balkema–de Haan theorem is often called the second theorem in extreme value theory. It gives the asymptotic tail distribution of a random variable X, when the true distribution F of X is unknown. Unlike the first theorem (the Fisher–Tippett–Gnedenko theorem) in extreme value theory, the interest here is the values above a threshold.
Conditional excess distribution function
If we consider an unknown distribution function 
 
 
 
  of a random variable 
 
 
 
 , we are interested in estimating the conditional distribution function 
 
 
 
  of the variable 
 
 
 
  above a certain threshold 
 
 
 
 . This is the so-called conditional excess distribution function, defined as



for 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is either the finite or infinite right endpoint of the underlying distribution 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
  describes the distribution of the excess value over a threshold 
 
 
 
 , given that the threshold is exceeded.
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a sequence of independent and identically-distributed random variables, and let 
 
 
 
  be their conditional excess distribution function. Pickands (1975), Balkema and de Haan (1974) posed that for a large class of underlying distribution functions 
 
 
 
 , and large 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is well approximated by the generalized Pareto distribution. That is:



where



 
 , if 
 
 



 
 , if 
 
 


Here σ > 0, and y ≥ 0 when k ≥ 0 and 0 ≤ y ≤ −σ/k when k \sigma, if k = 0.

Uniform distribution on 
 
 
 
 , if k = -1.
Pareto distribution, if k < 0.
