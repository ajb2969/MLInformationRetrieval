Conformal loop ensemble

(Figure)
In critical percolation on the honeycomb lattice, each hexagon face is colored red or black independently with equal probability. Every interface separating a black cluster from a red cluster is shown in green. This random collection of interfaces converges in law to CLE6 as the lattice spacing goes to zero.

(Figure)
 To define a random interface converging to SLE, we fix the colors of the hexagons along the boundary of the domain. This procedure defines a single interface separating red hexagons from black hexagons. This path converges in law to SLE6 as the lattice spacing goes to zero.

A conformal loop ensemble (CLEκ) is a random collection of non-crossing loops in a simply connected, open subset of the plane. These random collections of loops are indexed by a parameter κ, which may be any real number between 8/3 and 8. CLEκ is a loop version of the Schramm-Loewner evolution: SLEκ is designed to model a single discrete random interface, while CLEκ models a full collection of interfaces.
In many instances for which there is a conjectured or proved relationship between a discrete model and SLEκ, there is also a conjectured or proved relationship with CLEκ. For example:

CLE3 is the limit of interfaces for the critical Ising model.
CLE4 may be viewed as a set of level lines of the Gaussian free field.
CLE16/3 is a scaling limit of cluster interfaces in critical FK percolation.
CLE6 is a scaling limit of critical percolation on the triangular lattice.

Constructions
For 8/3 κ may be constructed using a branching variation of an SLEκ process (). When 8/3 κ may be alternatively constructed as the collection of outer boundaries of Brownian loop soup clusters ().
Properties
CLEκ is conformally invariant, which means that if 
 
 
 
  is a conformal map, then the law of a CLE in D' is the same as the law of the image of all the CLE loops in D under the map 
 
 
 
 .
Since CLEκ may be defined using an SLEκ process, CLE loops inherit many path properties from SLE. For example, each CLEκ loop is a fractal with almost-sure Hausdorff dimension 1+κ/8. Each loop is almost surely simple (no self intersections) when 8/3
