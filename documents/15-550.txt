It was discovered in 1914. 1 2  Voronoi tessellation  It is the Voronoi tessellation of the carbon atoms in diamond , 3 4 which lie in the diamond cubic crystal structure.  Being composed entirely of triakis truncated tetrahedra , it is cell-transitive .  Relation to quarter cubic honeycomb  It can be seen as the uniform quarter cubic honeycomb where its tetrahedal cells are subdivided by the center point into 4 shorter tetrahedra, and each adjoined to the adjacent truncated tetrahedral cells.
