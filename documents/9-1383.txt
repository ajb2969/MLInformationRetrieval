   Overtime rate      Overtime rate   Overtime rate is a calculation of hours worked by a worker that exceed those hours defined for a standard workweek . This rate can have different meanings in different countries and jurisdictions, depending on how that jurisdiction's labor law defines overtime . In many jurisdictions, additional pay is mandated for certain classes of workers when this set number of hours is exceeded. In others, there is no concept of a standard workweek or analogous time period, and no additional pay for exceeding a set number of hours within that week.  The overtime rate calculates the ratio between employee overtime with the regular hours in a specific time period. Even if the work is planned or scheduled, it can still be considered overtime if it exceeds what is considered the standard workweek in that jurisdiction.  A high overtime rate is a good indicator of a temporary or permanent high workload , and can be a contentious issue in labor-management relations . 1 It could result in a higher illness rate, 2 lower safety rate, 3 higher labor costs, and lower productivity .  United States  In the United States a standard workweek is considered to be 40 hours. Most waged employees or so-called non-exempt workers under U.S. federal labor and tax law must be paid at a wage rate of 150% of their regular hourly rate for hours that exceed 40 in a week. The start of the pay week can be defined by the employer, and need not be a standard calendar week start (e.g., Sunday midnight). Many employees, especially shift workers in the U.S., have some amount of overtime built into their schedules so that 24/7 coverage can be obtained.
