Bisimulation

In theoretical computer science a bisimulation is a binary relation between state transition systems, associating systems that behave in the same way in the sense that one system simulates the other and vice versa.
Intuitively two systems are bisimilar if they match each other's moves. In this sense, each of the systems cannot be distinguished from the other by an observer.
Formal definition
Given a labelled state transition system (
 
 
 
 , Λ, →), a bisimulation relation is a binary relation

 
  over 
 
 
 
  (i.e., 
 
 
 
  ⊆ 
 
 
 
  × 
 
 
 
 ) such that both 
 
 
−1 and 
 
 
 
  are simulations.
Equivalently 
 
 
 
  is a bisimulation if for every pair of elements 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , for all α in Λ:
for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 ,






p \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow} p'
 

implies that there is a 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that
 







q \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow} q'
 

and 
 
 
 
 ;
 

and, symmetrically, for all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 







q \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow} q'
 

implies that there is a 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that
 







p \overset{\alpha}{\rightarrow} p'
 

and 
 
 
 
 .
 

Given two states 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is bisimilar to 
 
 
 
 , written 
 
 
 
 , if there is a bisimulation 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
 .
The bisimilarity relation 
 
 
 
  is an equivalence relation. Furthermore, it is the largest bisimulation relation over a given transition system.
Note that it is not always the case that if 
 
 
 
  simulates 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  simulates 
 
 
 
  then they are bisimilar. For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to be bisimilar, the simulation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  must be the inverse of the simulation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Counter-example (in CCS, describing a coffee machine) 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  simulate each other but are not bisimilar.
Alternative definitions
Relational definition
Bisimulation can be defined in terms of composition of relations as follows.
Given a labelled state transition system

 
 , a bisimulation relation is a binary relation

 
  over 
 
 
 
  (i.e., 
 
 
 
  ⊆ 
 
 
 
  × 
 
 
 
 ) such that 
 
 








and
 
 




From the monotonicity and continuity of relation composition, it follows immediately that the set of the bisimulations is closed under unions (joins in the poset of relations), and a simple algebraic calculation shows that the relation of bisimilarity—the join of all bisimulations—is an equivalence relation. This definition, and the associated treatment of bisimilarity, can be interpreted in any involutive quantale.
Fixpoint definition
Bisimilarity can also be defined in order theoretical fashion, in terms of fixpoint theory, more precisely as the greatest fixed point of a certain function defined below.
Given a labelled state transition system (
 
 
 
 , Λ, →), define 
 
 
 
  to be a function from binary relations over 
 
 
 
  to binary relations over 
 
 
 
 , as follows:
Let 
 
 
 
  be any binary relation over 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is defined to be the set of all pairs 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  × 
 
 
 
  such that:



and



Bisimilarity is then defined to be the greatest fixed point of 
 
 
 
 .
Game theoretical definition
Bisimulation can also be thought of in terms of a game between two players: attacker and defender.
"Attacker" goes first and may choose any valid transition, 
 
 
 
 , from 
 
 
 
 . I.e.:


 
  or 
 
 

The "Defender" must then attempt to match that transition, 
 
 
 
  from either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  depending on the attacker's move. I.e., they must find an 
 
 
 
  such that:


 
  or 
 
 

Attacker and defender continue to take alternating turns until:

The defender is unable to find any valid transitions to match the attacker's move. In this case the attacker wins.
The game reaches states 
 
 
 
  that are both 'dead' (i.e., there are no transitions from either state) In this case the defender wins
The game goes on forever, in which case the defender wins.
The game reaches states 
 
 
 
 , which have already been visited. This is equivalent to an infinite play and counts as a win for the defender.

By the above definition the system is a bisimulation if and only if there exists a winning strategy for the defender.
Coalgebraic definition
A bisimulation for state transition systems is a special case of coalgebraic bisimulation for the type of covariant powerset functor. Note that every state transition system 
 
 
 
  is bijectively a function 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to the powerset of 
 
 
 
  indexed by 
 
 
 
  written as 
 
 
 
 , defined by








Let 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
 -th projection mapping 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively for 
 
 
 
 ; and 
 
 
 
  the forward image of 
 
 
 
  defined by dropping the third component








where 
 
 
 
  is a subset of 
 
 
 
 . Similarly for 
 
 
 
 .
Using the above notations, a relation 
 
 
 
  is a bisimulation on a transition system 
 
 
 
  if and only if there exists a transition system 
 
 
 
  on the relation 
 
 
 
  such that the diagram
frameless|upright=1.5
commutes, i.e. for 
 
 
 
 , the equations








hold where 
 
 
 
  is the functional representation of 
 
 
 
 .
Variants of bisimulation
In special contexts the notion of bisimulation is sometimes refined by adding additional requirements or constraints. For example if the state transition system includes a notion of silent (or internal) action, often denoted with 
 
 
 
 , i.e. actions that are not visible by external observers, then bisimulation can be relaxed to be weak bisimulation, in which if two states 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are bisimilar and there is some number of internal actions leading from 
 
 
 
  to some state 
 
 
 
  then there must exist state 
 
 
 
  such that there is some number (possibly zero) of internal actions leading from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
Typically, if the state transition system gives the operational semantics of a programming language, then the precise definition of bisimulation will be specific to the restrictions of the programming language. Therefore, in general, there may be more than one kind of bisimulation, (bisimilarity resp.) relationship depending on the context.
Bisimulation and modal logic
Since Kripke models are a special case of (labelled) state transition systems, bisimulation is also a topic in modal logic. In fact, modal logic is the fragment of first-order logic invariant under bisimulation (Van Benthem's theorem).
