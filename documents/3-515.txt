   Cofiniteness      Cofiniteness   In mathematics , a cofinite  subset of a set X is a subset A whose complement in X is a finite set. In other words, A contains all but finitely many elements of X . If the complement is not finite, but it is countable, then one says the set is cocountable .  These arise naturally when generalizing structures on finite sets to infinite sets, particularly on infinite products, as in the product topology or direct sum .  Boolean algebras  The set of all subsets of X that are either finite or cofinite forms a Boolean algebra , i.e., it is closed under the operations of union, intersection, and complementation. This Boolean algebra is the finite-cofinite algebra on X . A Boolean algebra A has a unique non-principal ultrafilter (i.e. a maximal filter not generated by a single element of the algebra) if and only if there is an infinite set X such that A is isomorphic to the finite-cofinite algebra on X . In this case, the non-principal ultrafilter is the set of all cofinite sets.  Cofinite topology  The cofinite topology (sometimes called the finite complement topology ) is a topology which can be defined on every set X . It has precisely the empty set and all cofinite subsets of X as open sets. As a consequence, in the cofinite topology, the only closed subsets are finite sets, or the whole of X . Symbolically, one writes the topology as      ùíØ  =   {   A  ‚äÜ  X   ‚à£   A  =    ‚àÖ  or  X   ‚àñ   A  is finite     }       ùíØ   conditional-set    A  X     A       or  X     A  is finite        \mathcal{T}=\{A\subseteq X\mid A=\varnothing\mbox{ or }X\setminus A\mbox{ is %
 finite}\}     This topology occurs naturally in the context of the Zariski topology . Since polynomials over a field  K are zero on finite sets, or the whole of K , the Zariski topology on K (considered as affine line ) is the cofinite topology. The same is true for any irreducible  algebraic curve ; it is not true, for example, for XY = 0 in the plane.  Properties   Subspaces: Every subspace topology of the cofinite topology is also a cofinite topology.  Compactness: Since every open set contains all but finitely many points of X , the space X is compact and sequentially compact .  Separation: The cofinite topology is the coarsest topology satisfying the T 1 axiom ; i.e. it is the smallest topology for which every singleton set is closed. In fact, an arbitrary topology on X satisfies the T 1 axiom if and only if it contains the cofinite topology. If X is finite then the cofinite topology is simply the discrete topology . If X is not finite, then this topology is not T 2 , regular or normal , since no two nonempty open sets are disjoint (i.e. it is hyperconnected ).   Double-pointed cofinite topology  The double-pointed cofinite topology is the cofinite topology with every point doubled; that is, it is the topological product of the cofinite topology with the indiscrete topology . It is not T 0 or T 1 , since the points of the doublet are topologically indistinguishable . It is, however, R 0 since the topologically distinguishable points are separable.  An example of a countable double-pointed cofinite topology is the set of even and odd integers, with a topology that groups them together. Let X be the set of integers, and let O A be a subset of the integers whose complement is the set A . Define a subbase of open sets G x for any integer x to be G x = O { x , x +1} if x is an even number , and G x = O { x -1, x } if x is odd. Then the basis sets of X are generated by finite intersections, that is, for finite A , the open sets of the topology are       U  A   :=    ‚ãÇ   x  ‚àà  A     G  x       assign   subscript  U  A     subscript     x  A     subscript  G  x      U_{A}:=\bigcap_{x\in A}G_{x}     The resulting space is not T 0 (and hence not T 1 ), because the points x and x + 1 (for x even) are topologically indistinguishable. The space is, however, a compact space , since it is covered by a finite union of the U A .  Other examples  Product topology  The product topology on a product of topological spaces    ‚àè   X  i      product   subscript  X  i     \prod X_{i}   has basis     ‚àè   U  i      product   subscript  U  i     \prod U_{i}   where     U  i   ‚äÇ   X  i        subscript  U  i    subscript  X  i     U_{i}\subset X_{i}   is open, and cofinitely many     U  i   =   X  i        subscript  U  i    subscript  X  i     U_{i}=X_{i}   .  The analog (without requiring that cofinitely many are the whole space) is the box topology .  Direct sum  The elements of the direct sum of modules     ‚äï   M  i      direct-sum   subscript  M  i     \bigoplus M_{i}   are sequences     Œ±  i   ‚àà   M  i        subscript  Œ±  i    subscript  M  i     \alpha_{i}\in M_{i}   where cofinitely many     Œ±  i   =  0       subscript  Œ±  i   0    \alpha_{i}=0   .  The analog (without requiring that cofinitely many are zero) is the direct product .  References    (See example 18)   "  Category:Basic concepts in infinite set theory  Category:General topology
