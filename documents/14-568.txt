   Nottingham group      Nottingham group   In the mathematical field of group theory , the Nottingham group is the group J ( F p ) or N ( F p ) consisting of formal power series  t + a 2 t 2 +... with coefficients in F p . The group multiplication is given by formal composition also called substitution. That is, if  $$f = t+ \sum_{n=2}^\infty a_n t^n$$ and if $g$ is another element, then  $$gf = f(g) = g+ \sum_{n=2}^\infty a_n g^n$$ . Notably, the group multiplication is not abelian . The group was studied by  and the name "Nottingham group" refers to Johnson's former domicile. It is a finitely generated pro- p -group.
