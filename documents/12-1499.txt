H square

In mathematics and control theory, H2, or H-square is a Hardy space with square norm. It is a subspace of L2 space, and is thus a Hilbert space. In particular, it is a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.
On the unit circle
In general, elements of L2 on the unit circle are given by



whereas elements of H2 are given by



The projection from L2 to H2 (by setting an = 0 when n \mathcal{L} given by



can be understood as a linear operator



where 
 
 
 
  is the set of square-integrable functions on the positive real number line, and 
 
 
 
  is the right half of the complex plane. It is more; it is an isomorphism, in that it is invertible, and it isometric, in that it satisfies



The Laplace transform is "half" of a Fourier transform; from the decomposition



one then obtains an orthogonal decomposition of 
 
 
 
  into two Hardy spaces



This is essentially the Paley-Wiener theorem.
