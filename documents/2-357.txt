   Overburden pressure      Overburden pressure   Overburden pressure , also called lithostatic pressure , confining pressure or vertical stress , is the pressure or stress imposed on a layer of soil or rock by the weight of overlying material.  The overburden pressure at a depth z is given by       p   (  z  )    =    p  0   +   g    ∫  0  z    ρ   (  z  )   d  z            p  z      subscript  p  0     g    superscript   subscript   0   z     ρ  z  d  z        p(z)=p_{0}+g\int_{0}^{z}\rho(z)\,dz     where ρ(z) is the density of the overlying rock at depth z and g is the acceleration due to gravity . p 0 is the datum pressure, the pressure at the surface.  It may be noted that the above equation implies that gravitational acceleration is a constant over z since it is placed outside of the integral. Strictly speaking, for almost all boundary conditions, g should appear inside the integrand since g is a function of the distance from mass. However, since g varies little over depths which are a very small fraction of the Earth's radius, it is placed outside of the integral in practice for most near-surface applications which require an assessment of lithostatic pressure. In deep-earth geophysics/geodynamics, gravitational acceleration varies significantly over depth, demanding that g be taken, at least, as a function of depth.
