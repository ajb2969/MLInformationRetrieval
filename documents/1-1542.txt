   Data stream      Data stream   In Connection-oriented communication , a data stream is a sequence of digitally encoded  coherent  signals ( packets of data or data packets ) used to transmit or receive information that is in the process of being transmitted. 1  Xputer  In electronics and computer architecture , a data flow determines for which time which data item is scheduled to enter or leave which port of a systolic array , a Reconfigurable Data Path Array or similar pipe network, or other processing unit or block ( cf. main article ).  Often the data stream is seen as the counterpart of an instruction stream, since the von Neumann machine is instruction-stream-driven, whereas its counterpart, the Xputer , is data stream driven.  The term "data stream" has many more meanings, such as by the definition from the context of systolic arrays .  Formal definition  In a formal way, a data stream is any ordered pair     (  s  ,  Δ  )     s  normal-Δ    (s,\Delta)   where:      s   s   s   is a sequence of tuples and     Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   is a sequence of positive real  time intervals .
