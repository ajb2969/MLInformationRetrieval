   Beta-alanyl-CoA ammonia-lyase      Beta-alanyl-CoA ammonia-lyase   In enzymology , a beta-alanyl-CoA ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   beta-alanyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acryloyl-CoA + NH 3    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , beta-alanyl-CoA , and two products , acryloyl-CoA and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is beta-alanyl-CoA ammonia-lyase (acryloyl-CoA-forming) . This enzyme is also called beta-alanyl coenzyme A ammonia-lyase . This enzyme participates in beta-alanine metabolism and propanoate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 4.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
