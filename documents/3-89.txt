   Chebyshev filter      Chebyshev filter   Chebyshev filters are analog or digital filters having a steeper roll-off and more passband  ripple (type I) or stopband ripple (type II) than Butterworth filters . Chebyshev filters have the property that they minimize the error between the idealized and the actual filter characteristic over the range of the filter, but with ripples in the passband. This type of filter is named after Pafnuty Chebyshev because its mathematical characteristics are derived from Chebyshev polynomials .  Because of the passband ripple inherent in Chebyshev filters, the ones that have a smoother response in the passband but a more irregular response in the stopband are preferred for some applications.  Type I Chebyshev filters  (Figure)  The frequency response of a fourth-order type I Chebyshev low-pass filter with    ε  =  1      ε  1    \varepsilon=1      Type I Chebyshev filters are the most common types of Chebyshev filters. The gain (or amplitude ) response as a function of angular frequency   ω   ω   \omega   of the n th-order low-pass filter is equal to the absolute value of the transfer function     H  n    (   j  ω   )        subscript  H  n     j  ω     H_{n}(j\omega)   :        G  n    (  ω  )    =   |    H  n    (   j  ω   )    |   =   1    1  +    ε  2    T  n  2    (   ω   ω  0    )                subscript  G  n   ω        subscript  H  n     j  ω            1      1     superscript  ε  2    superscript   subscript  T  n   2     ω   subscript  ω  0           G_{n}(\omega)=\left|H_{n}(j\omega)\right|=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^{2}T_{n%
 }^{2}\left(\frac{\omega}{\omega_{0}}\right)}}     where   ε   ε   \varepsilon   is the ripple factor,    ω  0     subscript  ω  0    \omega_{0}   is the cutoff frequency and    T  n     subscript  T  n    T_{n}   is a Chebyshev polynomial of the   n   n   n   th order.  The passband exhibits equiripple behavior, with the ripple determined by the ripple factor   ε   ε   \varepsilon   . In the passband, the Chebyshev polynomial alternates between -1 and 1 so the filter gain alternate between maxima at G = 1 and minima at    G  =   1  /    1  +   ε  2          G    1      1   superscript  ε  2        G=1/\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^{2}}   . At the cutoff frequency    ω  0     subscript  ω  0    \omega_{0}   the gain again has the value    1  /    1  +   ε  2         1      1   superscript  ε  2       1/\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^{2}}   but continues to drop into the stop band as the frequency increases. This behavior is shown in the diagram on the right. The common practice of defining the cutoff frequency at −3 dB is usually not applied to Chebyshev filters; instead the cutoff is taken as the point at which the gain falls to the value of the ripple for the final time.  The order of a Chebyshev filter is equal to the number of reactive components (for example, inductors ) needed to realize the filter using analog electronics .  The ripple is often given in dB :   Ripple in dB =    20    log  10     1  +   ε  2          20    subscript   10       1   superscript  ε  2        20\log_{10}\sqrt{1+\varepsilon^{2}}      so that a ripple amplitude of 3 dB results from    ε  =  1.      ε  1.    \varepsilon=1.     An even steeper roll-off can be obtained if ripple is allowed in the stop band, by allowing zeroes on the    j  ω      j  ω    j\omega   -axis in the complex plane. However, this results in less suppression in the stop band. The result is called an elliptic filter , also known as Cauer filter.   Poles and zeroes  (Figure)  Log of the absolute value of the gain of an 8th order Chebyshev type I filter in complex frequency space ( s = σ + jω ) with ε = 0.1 and     ω  0   =  1       subscript  ω  0   1    \omega_{0}=1   . The white spots are poles and are arranged on an ellipse with a semi-axis of 0.3836... in σ and 1.071... in ω. The transfer function poles are those poles in the left half plane. Black corresponds to a gain of 0.05 or less, white corresponds to a gain of 20 or more.   For simplicity, it is assumed that the cutoff frequency is equal to unity. The poles    (   ω   p  m    )     subscript  ω    p  m     (\omega_{pm})   of the gain function of the Chebyshev filter are the zeroes of the denominator of the gain function. Using the complex frequency s , these occur when:       1  +    ε  2    T  n  2    (   -   j  s    )     =   0.         1     superscript  ε  2    superscript   subscript  T  n   2       j  s      0.    1+\varepsilon^{2}T_{n}^{2}(-js)=0.\,     Defining     -   j  s    =   cos   (  θ  )            j  s      θ     -js=\cos(\theta)   and using the trigonometric definition of the Chebyshev polynomials yields:       1  +    ε  2    T  n  2    (   cos   (  θ  )    )     =   1  +    ε  2     cos  2    (   n  θ   )      =   0.           1     superscript  ε  2    superscript   subscript  T  n   2     θ       1     superscript  ε  2     superscript   2     n  θ           0.     1+\varepsilon^{2}T_{n}^{2}(\cos(\theta))=1+\varepsilon^{2}\cos^{2}(n\theta)=0.\,     Solving for   θ   θ   \theta         θ  =     1  n    arccos   (    ±  j   ε   )     +    m  π   n        θ        1  n        plus-or-minus  j   ε         m  π   n      \theta=\frac{1}{n}\arccos\left(\frac{\pm j}{\varepsilon}\right)+\frac{m\pi}{n}     where the multiple values of the arc cosine function are made explicit using the integer index m . The poles of the Chebyshev gain function are then:       s   p  m    =   j   cos   (  θ  )          subscript  s    p  m      j    θ      s_{pm}=j\cos(\theta)\,             =   j   cos   (     1  n    arccos   (    ±  j   ε   )     +    m  π   n    )      .      absent    j          1  n        plus-or-minus  j   ε         m  π   n        =j\cos\left(\frac{1}{n}\arccos\left(\frac{\pm j}{\varepsilon}\right)+\frac{m%
 \pi}{n}\right).        Using the properties of the trigonometric and hyperbolic functions, this may be written in explicitly complex form:       s   p  m   ±   =   ±    sinh   (    1  n   arsinh   (   1  ε   )    )     sin   (   θ  m   )           superscript   subscript  s    p  m    plus-or-minus    plus-or-minus          1  n   arsinh    1  ε        subscript  θ  m        s_{pm}^{\pm}=\pm\sinh\left(\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{arsinh}\left(\frac{1}{%
 \varepsilon}\right)\right)\sin(\theta_{m})       +j \cosh\left(\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{arsinh}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right)\right)\cos(\theta_m)      where m = 1, 2,..., n and        θ  m   =     π  2       2  m   -  1   n     .       subscript  θ  m       π  2         2  m   1   n      \theta_{m}=\frac{\pi}{2}\,\frac{2m-1}{n}.     This may be viewed as an equation parametric in    θ  n     subscript  θ  n    \theta_{n}   and it demonstrates that the poles lie on an ellipse in s -space centered at s = 0 with a real semi-axis of length    sinh   (    arsinh   (   1  /  ε   )    /  n   )           arsinh    1  ε    n     \sinh(\mathrm{arsinh}(1/\varepsilon)/n)   and an imaginary semi-axis of length of     cosh   (    arsinh   (   1  /  ε   )    /  n   )    .          arsinh    1  ε    n     \cosh(\mathrm{arsinh}(1/\varepsilon)/n).     The transfer function  The above expression yields the poles of the gain G . For each complex pole, there is another which is the complex conjugate, and for each conjugate pair there are two more that are the negatives of the pair. The transfer function must be stable, so that its poles are those of the gain that have negative real parts and therefore lie in the left half plane of complex frequency space. The transfer function is then given by       H   (  s  )    =     1    2   n  -  1    ε       ∏   m  =  1   n    1   (   s  -   s   p  m   -    )            H  s       1     superscript  2    n  1    ε      superscript   subscript  product    m  1    n     1    s   superscript   subscript  s    p  m            H(s)=\frac{1}{2^{n-1}\varepsilon}\ \prod_{m=1}^{n}\frac{1}{(s-s_{pm}^{-})}     where    s   p  m   -     superscript   subscript  s    p  m       s_{pm}^{-}   are only those poles with a negative sign in front of the real term in the above equation for the poles.  The group delay  (Figure)  Gain and group delay of a fifth-order type I Chebyshev filter with ε = 0.5.   The group delay is defined as the derivative of the phase with respect to angular frequency and is a measure of the distortion in the signal introduced by phase differences for different frequencies.       τ  g   =   -    d   d  ω     arg   (   H   (   j  ω   )    )           subscript  τ  g         d    d  ω        H    j  ω         \tau_{g}=-\frac{d}{d\omega}\arg(H(j\omega))     The gain and the group delay for a fifth-order type I Chebyshev filter with ε=0.5 are plotted in the graph on the left. It can be seen that there are ripples in the gain and the group delay in the passband but not in the stopband.   Type II Chebyshev filters  (Figure)  The frequency response of a fifth-order type II Chebyshev low-pass filter with    ε  =  0.01      ε  0.01    \varepsilon=0.01      Also known as inverse Chebyshev filters, the Type II Chebyshef filter type is less common because it does not roll off as fast as Type I, and requires more components. It has no ripple in the passband, but does have equiripple in the stopband. The gain is:         G  n    (  ω  ,   ω  0   )    =   1    1  +   1    ε  2    T  n  2    (    ω  0   /  ω   )         .         subscript  G  n    ω   subscript  ω  0       1      1    1     superscript  ε  2    superscript   subscript  T  n   2      subscript  ω  0   ω          G_{n}(\omega,\omega_{0})=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}T_{n}^{2}%
 \left(\omega_{0}/\omega\right)}}}.     In the stopband, the Chebyshev polynomial oscillates between -1 and 1 so that the gain will oscillate between zero and      1    1  +   1   ε  2          1      1    1   superscript  ε  2        \frac{1}{\sqrt{1+\frac{1}{\varepsilon^{2}}}}     and the smallest frequency at which this maximum is attained is the cutoff frequency    ω  o     subscript  ω  o    \omega_{o}   . The parameter ε is thus related to the stopband  attenuation γ in decibels by:       ε  =   1     10   0.1  γ    -  1      .      ε    1       superscript  10    0.1  γ    1       \varepsilon=\frac{1}{\sqrt{10^{0.1\gamma}-1}}.     For a stopband attenuation of 5 dB, ε = 0.6801; for an attenuation of 10 dB, ε = 0.3333. The frequency f 0 = ω 0 /2 π is the cutoff frequency. The 3 dB frequency f H is related to f 0 by:        f  H   =    f  0    cosh   (    1  n     cosh   -  1     1  ε     )      .       subscript  f  H      subscript  f  0         1  n     superscript     1      1  ε         f_{H}=\frac{f_{0}}{\cosh\left(\frac{1}{n}\cosh^{-1}\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right%
 )}.     Poles and zeroes  (Figure)  Log of the absolute value of the gain of an 8th order Chebyshev type II filter in complex frequency space (s=σ+jω) with ε = 0.1 and     ω  0   =  1       subscript  ω  0   1    \omega_{0}=1   . The white spots are poles and the black spots are zeroes. All 16 poles are shown. Each zero has multiplicity of two, and 12 zeroes are shown and four are located outside the picture, two on the positive ω axis, and two on the negative. The poles of the transfer function are poles on the left half plane and the zeroes of the transfer function are the zeroes, but with multiplicity 1. Black corresponds to a gain of 0.05 or less, white corresponds to a gain of 20 or more.   Assuming that the cutoff frequency is equal to unity, the poles    (   ω   p  m    )     subscript  ω    p  m     (\omega_{pm})   of the gain of the Chebyshev filter are the zeroes of the denominator of the gain:       1  +    ε  2    T  n  2    (   -    1  /  j    s   p  m      )     =  0.        1     superscript  ε  2    superscript   subscript  T  n   2         1  j    subscript  s    p  m        0.    1+\varepsilon^{2}T_{n}^{2}(-1/js_{pm})=0.     The poles of gain of the type II Chebyshev filter are the inverse of the poles of the type I filter:       1   s   p  m   ±    =   ±    sinh   (    1  n   arsinh   (   1  ε   )    )     sin   (   θ  m   )            1   superscript   subscript  s    p  m    plus-or-minus     plus-or-minus          1  n   arsinh    1  ε        subscript  θ  m        \frac{1}{s_{pm}^{\pm}}=\pm\sinh\left(\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{arsinh}\left(\frac{1}{%
 \varepsilon}\right)\right)\sin(\theta_{m})         +   j   cosh   (    1  n   arsinh   (   1  ε   )    )     cos   (   θ  m   )           j        1  n   arsinh    1  ε        subscript  θ  m       \qquad+j\cosh\left(\frac{1}{n}\mathrm{arsinh}\left(\frac{1}{\varepsilon}\right%
 )\right)\cos(\theta_{m})     where m = 1, 2, ..., n . The zeroes    (   ω   z  m    )     subscript  ω    z  m     (\omega_{zm})   of the type II Chebyshev filter are the zeroes of the numerator of the gain:        ε  2    T  n  2    (   -    1  /  j    s   z  m      )    =   0.          superscript  ε  2    superscript   subscript  T  n   2         1  j    subscript  s    z  m       0.    \varepsilon^{2}T_{n}^{2}(-1/js_{zm})=0.\,     The zeroes of the type II Chebyshev filter are therefore the inverse of the zeroes of the Chebyshev polynomial.       1  /   s   z  m     =   -   j   cos   (     π  2       2  m   -  1   n    )            1   subscript  s    z  m         j        π  2         2  m   1   n         1/s_{zm}=-j\cos\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\,\frac{2m-1}{n}\right)     for m = 1, 2, ..., n .  The transfer function  The transfer function is given by the poles in the left half plane of the gain function, and has the same zeroes but these zeroes are single rather than double zeroes.  The group delay  (Figure)  Gain and group delay of a fifth-order type II Chebyshev filter with ε = 0.1.   The gain and the group delay for a fifth-order type II Chebyshev filter with ε=0.1 are plotted in the graph on the left. It can be seen that there are ripples in the gain in the stop band but not in the pass band.   Implementation  Cauer topology  A passive LC Chebyshev low-pass filter may be realized using a Cauer topology . The inductor or capacitor values of a nth-order Chebyshev prototype filter may be calculated from the following equations: 1       G  0   =  1       subscript  G  0   1    G_{0}=1          G  1   =    2   A  1    γ        subscript  G  1       2   subscript  A  1    γ     G_{1}=\frac{2A_{1}}{\gamma}           G  k   =    4   A   k  -  1     A  k      B   k  -  1     G   k  -  1       ,   k  =   2  ,  3  ,  4  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence     subscript  G  k       4   subscript  A    k  1     subscript  A  k       subscript  B    k  1     subscript  G    k  1         k   2  3  4  normal-…  n      G_{k}=\frac{4A_{k-1}A_{k}}{B_{k-1}G_{k-1}},\qquad k=2,3,4,\dots,n          G   n  +  1    =   {     1     if  n  odd         coth  2    (    β  4    )       if  n  even            subscript  G    n  1     cases  1    if  n  odd     superscript  hyperbolic-cotangent  2     β  4      if  n  even      G_{n+1}=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }n\text{ odd}\\

(Figure)  Low-pass filter using Cauer topology   The calculated G k values may then be converted into shunt capacitors and series inductors as shown on the right, or they may be converted into series capacitors and shunt inductors. For example,   C 1 shunt = G 1 , L 2 series = G 2 , ...   or   L 1 shunt = G 1 , C 1 series = G 2 , ...   Note that when G 1 is a shunt capacitor or series inductor, G 0 corresponds to the input resistance or conductance, respectively. The same relationship holds for G n+1 and G n . The resulting circuit is a normalized low-pass filter. Using frequency transformations and impedance scaling , the normalized low-pass filter may be transformed into high-pass , band-pass , and band-stop filters of any desired cutoff frequency or bandwidth .  Digital  As with most analog filters, the Chebyshev may be converted to a digital (discrete-time) recursive form via the bilinear transform . However, as digital filters have a finite bandwidth, the response shape of the transformed Chebyshev is warped . Alternatively, the Matched Z-transform method may be used, which does not warp the response.  Comparison with other linear filters  The following illustration shows the Chebyshev filters next to other common filter types obtained with the same number of coefficients (fifth order):  (Figure)  Electronic linear filters.svg   Chebyshev filters are sharper than the Butterworth filter ; they are not as sharp as the elliptic one , but they show fewer ripples over the bandwidth.
