   Pytkeev space      Pytkeev space   In mathematics, and especially topology , a Pytkeev space is a topological space that satisfies qualities more subtle than a convergence of a sequence . They are named after E. G. Pytkeev, who proved in 1983 that sequential spaces have this property. 1  Definitions  Let X be a topological space. For a subset S of X let S denote the closure of S . Then a point x is called a Pytkeev point if for every set A with , there is a countable   π   π   \pi   -net of infinite subsets of A . A Pytkeev space is a space in which every point is a Pytkeev point. 2  Examples   Every sequential space is also a Pytkeev space. This is because, if  then there exists a sequence { a k } that converges to x . So take the countable π-net of infinite subsets of A to be }. 3    If X is a Pytkeev space, then it is also a Weakly Fréchet–Urysohn space .   References  "  Category:Topology     . ↩  ↩
