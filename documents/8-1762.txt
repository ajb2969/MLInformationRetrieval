Spread of a matrix




Spread of a matrix

In mathematics, and more specifically matrix theory, the spread of a matrix is the largest distance in the complex plane between any two eigenvalues of the matrix.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a square matrix with eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 . That is, these values 
 
 
 
  are the complex numbers such that there exists a vector 
 
 
 
  on which 
 
 
 
  acts by scalar multiplication:


 
  Then the spread of 
 
 
 
  is the non-negative number



Examples

For the zero matrix and the identity matrix, the spread is zero. The zero matrix has only zero as its eigenvalues, and the identity matrix has only one as its eigenvalues. In both cases, all eigenvalues are equal, so no two eigenvalues can be at nonzero distance from each other.
For a projection, the only eigenvalues are zero and one. A projection matrix therefore has a spread that is either 
 
 
 
  (if all eigenvalues are equal) or 
 
 
 
  (if there are two different eigenvalues).
All eigenvalues of an unitary matrix

 
  lie on the unit circle. Therefore, in this case, the spread is at most equal to the diameter of the circle, the numberÂ 2.
The spread of a matrix depends only on the spectrum of the matrix (its multiset of eigenvalues). If a second matrix 
 
 
 
  of the same size is invertible, then 
 
 
 
  has the same spectrum as 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, it also has the same spread as 
 
 
 
 .
