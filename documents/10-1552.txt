   Pyrimidodiazepine synthase      Pyrimidodiazepine synthase   In enzymology , a pyrimidodiazepine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a pyrimidodiazepine + glutathione disulfide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin + 2 glutathione   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are pyrimidodiazepine , glutathione disulfide , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 6-pyruvoyltetrahydropterin and glutathione .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyrimidodiazepine:glutathione-disulfide oxidoreductase (ring-opening, cyclizing) . Other names in common use include PDA synthase , pyrimidodiazepine:oxidized-glutathione oxidoreductase (ring-opening, , and cyclizing) . This enzyme participates in glutathione metabolism .
