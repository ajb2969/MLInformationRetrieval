   Acoustic theory      Acoustic theory   Acoustic theory is the field relating to mathematical description of sound waves . It is derived from fluid dynamics . See acoustics for the engineering approach.  The propagation of sound waves in a fluid (such as water) can be modeled by an equation of continuity (conservation of mass ) and an equation of motion (conservation of momentum ) . With some simplifications, in particular constant density, they can be given as follows:         ∂  p    ∂  t     +     κ   ∇   ⋅  𝐮           p     t     normal-⋅    κ  normal-∇   𝐮     \displaystyle\frac{\partial p}{\partial t}+\kappa~{}\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u}   where    p   (  𝐱  ,  t  )       p   𝐱  t     p(\mathbf{x},t)   is the acoustic pressure and    𝐮   (  𝐱  ,  t  )       𝐮   𝐱  t     \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)   is the flow velocity vector,   𝐱   𝐱   \mathbf{x}   is the vector of spatial coordinates    x  ,  y  ,  z     x  y  z    x,y,z   ,   t   t   t   is the time,    ρ  0     subscript  ρ  0    \rho_{0}   is the static mass density of the medium and   κ   κ   \kappa   is the bulk modulus of the medium. The bulk modulus can be expressed in terms of the density and the speed of sound in the medium (    c  0     subscript  c  0    c_{0}   ) as       κ  =    ρ  0     c  0  2      .      κ     subscript  ρ  0    superscript   subscript  c  0   2      \kappa=\rho_{0}c_{0}^{2}~{}.   If the flow velocity field is irrotational ,     ∇  ×  𝐮   =  𝟎        normal-∇  𝐮   0    \nabla\times\mathbf{u}=\mathbf{0}   , then the acoustic wave equation is a combination of these two sets of balance equations and can be expressed as 1            ∂  2   𝐮    ∂   t  2     -     c  0  2      ∇  2   𝐮     =   0  or         ∂  2   p    ∂   t  2     -     c  0  2      ∇  2   p     =  0    ,     formulae-sequence       continued-fraction    superscript   2   𝐮      superscript  t  2        superscript   subscript  c  0   2     superscript  normal-∇  2   𝐮      0  or         continued-fraction    superscript   2   p      superscript  t  2        superscript   subscript  c  0   2     superscript  normal-∇  2   p     0     \cfrac{\partial^{2}\mathbf{u}}{\partial t^{2}}-c_{0}^{2}~{}\nabla^{2}\mathbf{u%

Conservation of momentum  The equations for the conservation of linear momentum for a fluid medium are       ρ   (     ∂  𝐮    ∂  t    +   𝐮  ⋅   ∇  𝐮     )    =    -   ∇  p    +   ∇  ⋅  𝝉   +   ρ  𝐠          ρ        𝐮     t     normal-⋅  𝐮   normal-∇  𝐮           normal-∇  p     normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝝉     ρ  𝐠      \rho\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u%

We make several assumptions to derive the momentum balance equation for an acoustic medium. These assumptions and the resulting forms of the momentum equations are outlined below.  Assumption 1: Newtonian fluid  In acoustics, the fluid medium is assumed to be Newtonian . For a Newtonian fluid, the deviatoric stress tensor is related to the flow velocity by      𝝉  =     μ    [    ∇  𝐮   +    (   ∇  𝐮   )   T    ]    +    λ    (   ∇  ⋅  𝐮   )   1        𝝉      μ   delimited-[]     normal-∇  𝐮    superscript   normal-∇  𝐮   T        λ   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐮   1      \boldsymbol{\tau}=\mu~{}\left[\nabla\mathbf{u}+(\nabla\mathbf{u})^{T}\right]+%
 \lambda~{}(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})~{}\boldsymbol{\mathit{1}}   where   μ   μ   \mu   is the shear viscosity and   λ   λ   \lambda   is the bulk viscosity .  Therefore, the divergence of   𝝉   𝝉   \boldsymbol{\tau}   is given by       ∇  ⋅  𝝉   ≡     ∂   s   i  j      ∂   x  i           normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝝉    continued-fraction     subscript  s    i  j        subscript  x  i       \displaystyle\nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau}\equiv\cfrac{\partial s_{ij}}{%
 \partial x_{i}}   Using the identity      ∇  2   𝐮   =    ∇   (   ∇  ⋅  𝐮   )    -   ∇  ×  ∇  ×  𝐮          superscript  normal-∇  2   𝐮      normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐮      normal-∇  normal-∇  𝐮      \nabla^{2}\mathbf{u}=\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})-\nabla\times\nabla\times%
 \mathbf{u}   , we have        ∇  ⋅  𝝉   =     (    2  μ   +  λ   )    ∇   (   ∇  ⋅  𝐮   )     -     μ   ∇   ×  ∇  ×   𝐮      .       normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝝉           2  μ   λ    normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐮         μ  normal-∇   normal-∇  𝐮      \nabla\cdot\boldsymbol{\tau}=(2\mu+\lambda)~{}\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})-%

The equations for the conservation of momentum may then be written as       ρ   (     ∂  𝐮    ∂  t    +   𝐮  ⋅   ∇  𝐮     )    =      -   ∇  p    +    (    2  μ   +  λ   )    ∇   (   ∇  ⋅  𝐮   )      -     μ   ∇   ×  ∇  ×  𝐮    +   ρ  𝐠          ρ        𝐮     t     normal-⋅  𝐮   normal-∇  𝐮               normal-∇  p          2  μ   λ    normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐮          μ  normal-∇   normal-∇  𝐮      ρ  𝐠      \rho\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u%

 \times\nabla\times\mathbf{u}+\rho\mathbf{g}     Assumption 2: Irrotational flow  For most acoustics problems we assume that the flow is irrotational, that is, the vorticity is zero. In that case       ∇  ×  𝐮   =  0        normal-∇  𝐮   0    \nabla\times\mathbf{u}=0   and the momentum equation reduces to       ρ   (     ∂  𝐮    ∂  t    +   𝐮  ⋅   ∇  𝐮     )    =    -   ∇  p    +    (    2  μ   +  λ   )    ∇   (   ∇  ⋅  𝐮   )     +   ρ  𝐠          ρ        𝐮     t     normal-⋅  𝐮   normal-∇  𝐮           normal-∇  p          2  μ   λ    normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐮       ρ  𝐠      \rho\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u%
 }\right)=-\nabla p+(2\mu+\lambda)~{}\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})+\rho\mathbf{g}     Assumption 3: No body forces  Another frequently made assumption is that effect of body forces on the fluid medium is negligible. The momentum equation then further simplifies to       ρ   (     ∂  𝐮    ∂  t    +   𝐮  ⋅   ∇  𝐮     )    =    -   ∇  p    +    (    2  μ   +  λ   )    ∇   (   ∇  ⋅  𝐮   )            ρ        𝐮     t     normal-⋅  𝐮   normal-∇  𝐮           normal-∇  p          2  μ   λ    normal-∇   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐮        \rho\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u%
 }\right)=-\nabla p+(2\mu+\lambda)~{}\nabla(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})     Assumption 4: No viscous forces  Additionally, if we assume that there are no viscous forces in the medium (the bulk and shear viscosities are zero), the momentum equation takes the form       ρ   (     ∂  𝐮    ∂  t    +   𝐮  ⋅   ∇  𝐮     )    =   -   ∇  p          ρ        𝐮     t     normal-⋅  𝐮   normal-∇  𝐮         normal-∇  p      \rho\left(\frac{\partial\mathbf{u}}{\partial t}+\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u%
 }\right)=-\nabla p     Assumption 5: Small disturbances  An important simplifying assumption for acoustic waves is that the amplitude of the disturbance of the field quantities is small. This assumption leads to the linear or small signal acoustic wave equation. Then we can express the variables as the sum of the (time averaged) mean field (    ⟨  ⋅  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  normal-⋅    \langle\cdot\rangle   ) that varies in space and a small fluctuating field (    ⋅  ~     normal-~  normal-⋅    \tilde{\cdot}   ) that varies in space and time. That is       p  =    ⟨  p  ⟩   +    p  ~      ;    ρ  =    ⟨  ρ  ⟩   +    ρ  ~      ;   𝐮  =    ⟨  𝐮  ⟩   +   𝐮  ~         formulae-sequence    p     delimited-⟨⟩  p    normal-~  p      formulae-sequence    ρ     delimited-⟨⟩  ρ    normal-~  ρ       𝐮     delimited-⟨⟩  𝐮    normal-~  𝐮        p=\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}~{};~{}~{}\rho=\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}~{};%

 \nabla\left[\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}\right]   Since the fluctuations are assumed to be small, products of the fluctuation terms can be neglected (to first order) and we have       ⟨  ρ  ⟩      ∂   𝐮  ~     ∂  t          delimited-⟨⟩  ρ        normal-~  𝐮      t      \displaystyle\langle\rho\rangle~{}\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t}     Assumption 6: Homogeneous medium  Next we assume that the medium is homogeneous; in the sense that the time averaged variables    ⟨  p  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  p    \langle p\rangle   and    ⟨  ρ  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  ρ    \langle\rho\rangle   have zero gradients, i.e.,         ∇   ⟨  p  ⟩    =   0    ;    ∇   ⟨  ρ  ⟩    =   0     .     formulae-sequence     normal-∇  p   0      normal-∇  ρ   0     \nabla\langle p\rangle=0~{};~{}~{}\nabla\langle\rho\rangle=0~{}.   The momentum equation then becomes         ⟨  ρ  ⟩     ∂   𝐮  ~     ∂  t     +    [    ⟨  ρ  ⟩   +   ρ  ~    ]    [    ⟨  𝐮  ⟩   ⋅   ∇   ⟨  𝐮  ⟩     ]    +    ⟨  ρ  ⟩    [     ⟨  𝐮  ⟩   ⋅   ∇   𝐮  ~     +    𝐮  ~   ⋅   ∇   ⟨  𝐮  ⟩      ]     =   -   ∇   p  ~              delimited-⟨⟩  ρ        normal-~  𝐮      t        delimited-[]     delimited-⟨⟩  ρ    normal-~  ρ      delimited-[]   normal-⋅   delimited-⟨⟩  𝐮    normal-∇  𝐮         delimited-⟨⟩  ρ    delimited-[]     normal-⋅   delimited-⟨⟩  𝐮    normal-∇   normal-~  𝐮      normal-⋅   normal-~  𝐮    normal-∇  𝐮           normal-∇   normal-~  p       \langle\rho\rangle~{}\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t}+\left[%

Then the balance of momentum reduces to        ⟨  ρ  ⟩     ∂   𝐮  ~     ∂  t     =   -   ∇   p  ~            delimited-⟨⟩  ρ        normal-~  𝐮      t        normal-∇   normal-~  p       \langle\rho\rangle~{}\frac{\partial\tilde{\mathbf{u}}}{\partial t}=-\nabla%

Conservation of mass  The equation for the conservation of mass in a fluid volume (without any mass sources or sinks) is given by         ∂  ρ    ∂  t    +   ∇  ⋅   (   ρ  𝐮   )     =  0            ρ     t     normal-⋅  normal-∇    ρ  𝐮     0    \frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}+\nabla\cdot(\rho\mathbf{u})=0   where    ρ   (  𝐱  ,  t  )       ρ   𝐱  t     \rho(\mathbf{x},t)   is the mass density of the fluid and    𝐮   (  𝐱  ,  t  )       𝐮   𝐱  t     \mathbf{u}(\mathbf{x},t)   is the flow velocity.  The equation for the conservation of mass for an acoustic medium can also be derived in a manner similar to that used for the conservation of momentum.  Assumption 1: Small disturbances  From the assumption of small disturbances we have       p  =    ⟨  p  ⟩   +    p  ~      ;    ρ  =    ⟨  ρ  ⟩   +    ρ  ~      ;   𝐮  =    ⟨  𝐮  ⟩   +   𝐮  ~         formulae-sequence    p     delimited-⟨⟩  p    normal-~  p      formulae-sequence    ρ     delimited-⟨⟩  ρ    normal-~  ρ       𝐮     delimited-⟨⟩  𝐮    normal-~  𝐮        p=\langle p\rangle+\tilde{p}~{};~{}~{}\rho=\langle\rho\rangle+\tilde{\rho}~{};%

 \alpha^{2}~{}Q   The equation on the left is the Bessel equation which has the general solution       R   (  r  )    =      A  α     J  α    (    k   r   )    +     B  α     J   -  α     (    k   r   )           R  r        subscript  A  α    subscript  J  α     k  r       subscript  B  α    subscript  J    α      k  r       R(r)=A_{\alpha}~{}J_{\alpha}(k~{}r)+B_{\alpha}~{}J_{-\alpha}(k~{}r)   where    J  α     subscript  J  α    J_{\alpha}   is the cylindrical Bessel function of the first kind and     A  α   ,   B  α       subscript  A  α    subscript  B  α     A_{\alpha},B_{\alpha}   are undetermined constants. The equation on the right has the general solution       Q   (  θ  )    =      C  α     e   i  α  θ     +     D  α     e   -   i  α  θ             Q  θ        subscript  C  α    superscript  e    i  α  θ        subscript  D  α    superscript  e      i  α  θ         Q(\theta)=C_{\alpha}~{}e^{i\alpha\theta}+D_{\alpha}~{}e^{-i\alpha\theta}   where     C  α   ,   D  α       subscript  C  α    subscript  D  α     C_{\alpha},D_{\alpha}   are undetermined constants. Then the solution of the acoustic wave equation is       p   (  r  ,  θ  )    =    [      A  α     J  α    (    k   r   )    +     B  α     J   -  α     (    k   r   )     ]    (      C  α     e   i  α  θ     +     D  α     e   -   i  α  θ       )          p   r  θ       delimited-[]       subscript  A  α    subscript  J  α     k  r       subscript  B  α    subscript  J    α      k  r           subscript  C  α    superscript  e    i  α  θ        subscript  D  α    superscript  e      i  α  θ          p(r,\theta)=\left[A_{\alpha}~{}J_{\alpha}(k~{}r)+B_{\alpha}~{}J_{-\alpha}(k~{}%
