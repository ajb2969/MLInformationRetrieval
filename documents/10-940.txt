Phloroglucinol reductase

In enzymology, a phloroglucinol reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

dihydrophloroglucinol + NADP+

 
  phloroglucinol + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dihydrophloroglucinol and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are phloroglucinol, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dihydrophloroglucinol:NADP+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via coa ligation.
