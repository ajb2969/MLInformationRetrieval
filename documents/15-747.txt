Ferrero–Washington theorem

In algebraic number theory, the Ferrero–Washington theorem, proved first by  and later by , states that Iwasawa's μ-invariant vanishes for cyclotomic Zp-extensions of abelian algebraic number fields.
History
introduced the μ-invariant of a Zp-extension and observed that it was zero in all cases he calculated.  used a computer to check that it vanishes for the cyclotomic Zp-extension of the rationals for all primes less than 4000.  later conjectured that the μ-invariant vanishes for any Zp-extension, but shortly after  discovered examples of non-cyclotomic extensions of number fields with non-vanishing μ-invariant showing that his original conjecture was wrong. He suggested, however, that the conjecture might still hold for cyclotomic Zp-extensions.
showed that the vanishing of the μ-invariant for cyclotomic Zp-extensions of the rationals is equivalent to certain congruences between Bernoulli numbers, and  showed that the μ-invariant vanishes in these cases by proving that these congruences hold.
Statement
For a number field K we let Km denote the extension by pm-power roots of unity, 
 
 
 
  the union of the Km and A(p) the maximal unramified abelian p-extension of 
 
 
 
 . Let the Tate module


 
  Then Tp(K) is a pro-p-group and so a Zp-module. Using class field theory one can describe Tp(K) as isomorphic to the inverse limit of the class groups Cm of the Km under norm.1
Iwasawa exhibited Tp(K) as a module over the completion Zp[[T]] and this implies a formula for the exponent of p in the order of the class groups Cm of the form


 
  The Ferrero–Washington theorem states that μ is zero.2
