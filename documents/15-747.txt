   Ferrero–Washington theorem      Ferrero–Washington theorem   In algebraic number theory , the Ferrero–Washington theorem , proved first by  and later by , states that Iwasawa's μ-invariant vanishes for cyclotomic Z p -extensions of abelian algebraic number fields .  History  introduced the μ-invariant of a Z p -extension and observed that it was zero in all cases he calculated.  used a computer to check that it vanishes for the cyclotomic Z p -extension of the rationals for all primes less than 4000.  later conjectured that the μ-invariant vanishes for any Z p -extension, but shortly after  discovered examples of non-cyclotomic extensions of number fields with non-vanishing μ-invariant showing that his original conjecture was wrong. He suggested, however, that the conjecture might still hold for cyclotomic Z p -extensions.  showed that the vanishing of the μ-invariant for cyclotomic Z p -extensions of the rationals is equivalent to certain congruences between Bernoulli numbers , and  showed that the μ-invariant vanishes in these cases by proving that these congruences hold.  Statement  For a number field K we let K m denote the extension by p m -power roots of unity,    K  ^     normal-^  K    \hat{K}   the union of the K m and A ( p ) the maximal unramified abelian p -extension of    K  ^     normal-^  K    \hat{K}   . Let the Tate module         T  p    (  K  )    =   Gal   (    A   (  p  )    /   K  ^    )     .         subscript  T  p   K     Gal     superscript  A  p    normal-^  K       T_{p}(K)=\mathrm{Gal}(A^{(p)}/\hat{K})\ .   Then T p ( K ) is a pro- p -group and so a Z p -module. Using class field theory one can describe T p ( K ) as isomorphic to the inverse limit of the class groups C m of the K m under norm. 1  Iwasawa exhibited T p ( K ) as a module over the completion Z p [ [ T ]] and this implies a formula for the exponent of p in the order of the class groups C m of the form        λ  m   +   μ   p  m    +   κ    .        λ  m     μ   superscript  p  m    κ    \lambda m+\mu p^{m}+\kappa\ .   The Ferrero–Washington theorem states that μ is zero. 2  References            "  Category:Theorems in algebraic number theory     ↩  ↩
