   Star coloring      Star coloring   In graph-theoretic  mathematics , a star coloring of a graph G is a (proper) vertex coloring in which every path on four vertices uses at least three distinct colors. Equivalently, in a star coloring, the induced subgraphs formed by the vertices of any two colors has connected components that are star graphs . Star coloring has been introduced by . The star chromatic number      χ  s    (  G  )        subscript  χ  s   G    \chi_{s}(G)   of G is the least number of colors needed to star color G .  One generalization of star coloring is the closely related concept of acyclic coloring , where it is required that every cycle uses at least three colors, so the two-color induced subgraphs are forests . If we denote the acyclic chromatic number of a graph G by     χ  a    (  G  )        subscript  χ  a   G    \chi_{a}(G)   , we have that      χ  a    (  G  )    ≤    χ  s    (  G  )           subscript  χ  a   G      subscript  χ  s   G     \chi_{a}(G)\leq\chi_{s}(G)   , and in fact every star coloring of G is an acyclic coloring. Actually we can remark that the star coloring is an acyclic coloring such that if we take two classes of colors then the induced subgraph is a bipartite graph composed only of stars. Grünbaum linked star coloring to acyclic coloring by showing that any planar graph has an acyclic chromatic number less than or equal to 9, and by suggesting that this implies that any planar graph has a star chromatic number less than or equal to 9*2^8=2304.  The star chromatic number has been proved to be bounded on every proper minor closed class by . This results was further generalized by  to all low-tree-depth colorings (standard coloring and star coloring being low-tree-depth colorings with respective parameter 1 and 2).  Complexity  It was demonstrated by  that it is NP-complete to determine whether      χ  s    (  G  )    ≤  3         subscript  χ  s   G   3    \chi_{s}(G)\leq 3   , even when G is a graph that is both planar and bipartite .  showed that finding an optimal star coloring is NP-hard even when G is a bipartite graph.  Results  Relation between star coloring and acyclic coloring:  1)For any graph G, A(G)≤     χ  s    (  G  )        subscript  χ  s   G    \chi_{s}(G)   where A(G) is the acyclic chromatic number .  2) For any graph G, if the acyclic chromatic number of G satisfies A(G)≤ k, then the star chromatic number of G satisfies     χ  s    (  G  )        subscript  χ  s   G    \chi_{s}(G)   ≤ k*2^(k-1).
