   Grossberg network      Grossberg network   Grossberg network is a artificial neural network introduced by Stephen Grossberg . It is a self organizing , competitive network based on continuous time. 1 Grossberg a neuroscientist and a biomedical engineer designed this network based on the human visual system .  Shunting model  Shunting model is one of the Grossberg's neural network model based on Leaky integrator , given by the expression:         ϵ  d  n   (  t  )    /  d   t   =     -   n   (  t  )     +    (    b  +   -   n   (  t  )     )    p  +     -    (    n   (  t  )    +   b  -    )     p  -                ϵ  d  n  t   d   t           n  t         superscript  b      n  t     superscript  p            n  t    superscript  b      superscript  p        \epsilon dn(t)/dt=-n(t)+(b^{+}-n(t))p^{+}-(n(t)+b^{-})p^{-}\,     References  "  Category:Artificial neural networks     ↩
