Draft:Portfolio performance contributions

Portfolio performance contributions1 form a summable set of measures which explains and breaks down the different sources of a portfolio global performance in presence of external flows. Portfolio external flows are movements of value in or out of the portfolio such as transfers of cash, securities or other instruments, with no equal simultaneous movement of value in the opposite direction, and which are not income (such as interest, coupons or dividends) or outcome (such as fees) from the investments in the portfolio. The sum of the performance contribution of all the portfolio components (such as securities performance, currencies performance, fees or other portfolio internal sources of performance) equals the total portfolio performance (i.e. portfolio performance contributions are additive).
Formula
The portfolio performance contributions computation algorithm, developed by R. Barbanneau, is as follows:
Introduction
Inputs
Let,



 
  the portfolio total net asset value at time step 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  the portfolio net external cash flow at time step 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  the portfolio component 
 
 
 
  movement quantity (i.e. traded quantity) at time step 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  the quantity held at the beginning of the period, at time step 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  the portfolio component 
 
 
 
  price at time step 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  the portfolio component 
 
 
 
  dividend payment at time step 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  the portfolio component 
 
 
 
  currency exchange rate (against the portfolio base currency) at time step 
 
 
 
 .

Traded quantity adjusted currency exchange rate
The performance contributions inherited from the currency contribution of portfolio components are evaluated by computing the weighted average traded quantity currency exchange rate for each portfolio component at each time step 
 
 
 
  (other valuation methodologies can be used for computation, such as FIFO and LIFO accounting). Let 
 
 
 
  the portfolio component 
 
 
 
  weighted average traded quantity currency exchange rate (against the portfolio base currency) at time step 
 
 
 
 ,



With,






Where 
 
 
 
  is the proportion of the portfolio component 
 
 
 
  traded quantity at time step 
 
 
 
  impacting the weighted average traded quantity currency exchange rate of component 
 
 
 
 ,



Adjustement factor
Each external cash flow has an impact on the performance contributions computation, both at the portfolio level and the portfolio components level. External inflows dilute the performance whereas external outflows concentrate the performance.

Let 
 
 
 
  the portfolio adjustement factor (i.e. the performance dilution or concentration measurement at the portfolio level) at time step 
 
 
 
 ,





Let 
 
 
 
  the portfolio component 
 
 
 
  adjustement factor (i.e. the performance dilution or concentration measurement at the portfolio component 
 
 
 
  level) at time step 
 
 
 
 ,




Global portfolio performance
Let,



 
  the global portfolio performance,


 
  the performance contribution of the 
 
 
 
 -th portfolio component for 
 
 
 
 ,

Each component is decomposed into two sources of performance contribution,



 
  the performance contribution of the 
 
 
 
 -th portfolio component hedged continuously against the currency variations,


 
  the performance contribution of the currency variations of the 
 
 
 
 -th portfolio component,

Hence,



Performance contribution of portfolio components
For every 
 
 
 
 , the performance contribution of the 
 
 
 
 -th portfolio component is computed as follows,



Base contribution



Currency contribution



Interpretation
The portfolio performance contributions algorithm evaluates over a period of time the different sources of performance of a portfolio. By decomposing the contribution of each portfolio component into a base and a currency part, the algorithm allows the computation of contributions to the performance of currencies over a portfolio. Furthermore, the performance contribution of specific portfolio components computation, such as compensatory fees, can be derived from the method by weighting each amount at each time step by the portfolio adjustement factor.
