<h1>Money creation</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="economics" title="wikilink">economics</a>, <strong>money creation</strong> is the process by which the <a href="money_supply" title="wikilink">money supply</a> of a country or a monetary region (such as the <a class="uri" href="Eurozone" title="wikilink">Eurozone</a>) is increased. A <a href="central_bank" title="wikilink">central bank</a> may introduce new money into the economy (termed "expansionary <a href="monetary_policy" title="wikilink">monetary policy</a>", or "money printing" by detractors) by purchasing <a href="financial_asset" title="wikilink">financial assets</a> or lending money to financial institutions. <a href="Commercial_bank" title="wikilink">Commercial bank</a> lending also creates money under the form of <a href="demand_deposit" title="wikilink">demand deposits</a>. When banks had sizable <a href="reserve_requirement" title="wikilink">reserve requirements</a> (freezing an important percentage of their deposits in mandatory reserves at the central bank) it was said that the process multiplied this <a href="base_money" title="wikilink">base money</a> through <a href="fractional_reserve_banking" title="wikilink">fractional reserve banking</a>.</p>

<p><a href="Central_bank" title="wikilink">Central banks</a> monitor the amount of <a class="uri" href="money" title="wikilink">money</a> in the economy by measuring monetary aggregates such as <a href="M2_(economics)" title="wikilink">M2</a>. The effect of monetary policy on the money supply is indicated by comparing these measurements on various dates. For example, in the United States, money supply measured as M2 grew from $6.407 trillion in January 2005, to $8.319 trillion in January 2009.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="money-creation-by-the-commercial-banks">Money creation by the commercial banks</h2>

<p>In the contemporary economic system, most money in circulation exists not as cash or coins but as bank deposits. The main way in which those bank deposits are created, is through loans made by commercial banks. When a bank makes a loan, a deposit is created at the same time in the borrower's bank account. In that way, new money is created as a bookkeeping entry, with the loan representing an <a class="uri" href="asset" title="wikilink">asset</a> and the deposit a <a href="liability_(financial_accounting)" title="wikilink">liability</a> on the bank's balance sheet. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>

<p>Monetary policy regulates a country's <a href="money_supply" title="wikilink">money supply</a>, the amount of broad currency in circulation. Almost all modern nations have <a href="central_bank" title="wikilink">central banks</a> such as the United States <a href="Federal_Reserve_System" title="wikilink">Federal Reserve System</a>, the <a href="European_Central_Bank" title="wikilink">European Central Bank</a> (ECB), and the <a href="People's_Bank_of_China" title="wikilink">People's Bank of China</a> for conducting monetary policy. Charged with the smooth functioning of the money supply and financial markets, these institutions are generally independent of the government <a href="Executive_(government)" title="wikilink">executive</a>.</p>

<p>The primary tool of monetary policy is <a href="open_market_operation" title="wikilink">open market operations</a>: the central bank buys and sells financial assets such as treasury bills, government bonds, or foreign currencies from private parties. Purchases of these assets result in currency entering market circulation, while sales of these assets remove currency. Usually, open market operations are designed to target a specific short-term interest rate. For example, the <a href="U.S._Federal_Reserve" title="wikilink">U.S. Federal Reserve</a> may target the <a href="federal_funds_rate" title="wikilink">federal funds rate</a>, the rate at which member banks <a href="Interbank_lending_market" title="wikilink">lend to one another</a> overnight. In other instances, they might instead target a specific exchange rate relative to some foreign currency, the price of gold, or indices such as the <a href="Consumer_Price_Index" title="wikilink">consumer price index</a>.</p>

<p>Other monetary policy tools to expand the money supply include decreasing interest rates by <a href="Fiat_money" title="wikilink">fiat</a>; increasing the <a href="monetary_base" title="wikilink">monetary base</a>; and decreasing <a href="reserve_requirement" title="wikilink">reserve requirements</a>. Some other means are: <a href="discount_window" title="wikilink">discount window</a> lending (as <a href="lender_of_last_resort" title="wikilink">lender of last resort</a>); <a href="moral_suasion" title="wikilink">moral suasion</a> (cajoling the behavior of certain market players); and "open mouth operations" (publicly asserting future monetary policy). The conduct and effects of monetary policy and the regulation of the banking system are of central concern to <a href="monetary_economics" title="wikilink">monetary economics</a>.</p>
<h3 id="quantitative-easing">Quantitative easing</h3>

<p>Quantitative easing involves the creation of a significant amount of new <a href="Monetary_base" title="wikilink">base money</a> by a central bank by the buying of assets that it usually does not buy. Usually, a central bank will conduct open market operations by buying short-term government bonds or foreign currency. However, during a <a href="financial_crisis" title="wikilink">financial crisis</a>, the central bank may buy other types of financial assets as well. The central bank may buy long-term government bonds, company bonds, asset-backed securities, stocks, or even extend commercial loans. The intent is to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity and promoting bank lending, even when interest rates cannot be pushed any lower.</p>

<p>Quantitative easing increases reserves in the banking system (i.e., deposits of commercial banks at the central bank), giving depository institutions the ability to make new loans. Quantitative easing is usually used when lowering the <a href="discount_window" title="wikilink">discount rate</a> is no longer effective because interest rates are already close to or at zero. In such a case, normal monetary policy cannot further lower interest rates, and the economy is in a <a href="liquidity_trap" title="wikilink">liquidity trap</a>.</p>
<h2 id="physical-currency">Physical currency</h2>

<p>In modern economies, relatively little of the supply of broad money is in physical currency. For example, in December 2010 in the United States, of the $8.853 trillion in broad money supply (M2), only about 10% (or $915.7 billion) consisted of physical coins and paper money.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The manufacturing of new physical money is usually the responsibility of the central bank, or sometimes, the government's <a class="uri" href="treasury" title="wikilink">treasury</a>.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, money creation in a modern economy does not directly involve the manufacturing of new physical money, such as <a href="banknote" title="wikilink">paper currency</a> or metal coins. Instead, when the central bank expands the money supply through <a href="open_market_operations" title="wikilink">open market operations</a> (e.g., by purchasing government bonds), it credits the accounts that commercial banks hold at the central bank (termed <a href="Monetary_base#Management" title="wikilink">high-powered money</a>). Commercial banks may draw on these accounts to withdraw physical money from the central bank. Commercial banks may also return soiled or spoiled currency to the central bank in exchange for new currency.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="money-creation-through-the-fractional-reserve-system">Money creation through the fractional reserve system</h2>

<p>Through <a href="fractional_reserve_banking" title="wikilink">fractional reserve banking</a>, the modern banking system expands the money supply of a country beyond the amount initially created by the central bank.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a> There are two types of money in a fractional-reserve banking system: <a class="uri" href="currency" title="wikilink">currency</a> originally issued by the central bank, and <a href="Deposit_account" title="wikilink">bank deposits</a> at commercial banks:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>
<ol>
<li><em>Central bank money</em> (all money created by the central bank regardless of its form, e.g., banknotes, coins, <a href="electronic_money" title="wikilink">electronic money</a>)</li>
<li><em>Commercial bank money</em> (money created in the banking system through borrowing and lending) – sometimes referred to as <em>checkbook money</em><ref>Chicago Fed – Our Central Bank: <a class="uri" href="http://www.chicagofed.org/consumer_information/the_fed_our_central_bank.cfm">http://www.chicagofed.org/consumer_information/the_fed_our_central_bank.cfm</a></ref></li>
<li>the reference is found in the "Money Manager" section:
<ol>
<li>"the Fed works to control money at its source by affecting the ability of financial institutions to "create" checkbook money through loans or investments. The control lever that the Fed uses in this process is the "reserves" that banks and thrifts must hold."</li>
</ol></li>
</ol>

<p>When a commercial bank loan is extended, new commercial bank money is created if the loan proceeds are issued in the form of an increase in a customer's <a href="demand_deposit" title="wikilink">demand deposit</a> account (that is, an increase in the bank's demand deposit liability owed to the customer). As a loan is paid back through reductions in the demand deposit liabilities the bank owes to a customer, that commercial bank money disappears from existence. Because loans are continually being issued in a normally functioning economy, the amount of broad money in the economy remains relatively stable. Because of this money creation process by the commercial banks, the money supply of a country is usually a multiple larger than the money issued by the central bank; that multiple was traditionally determined by the <a href="reserve_requirement" title="wikilink">reserve requirements</a> and now essentially by other financial ratios (primarily the <a href="capital_adequacy_ratio" title="wikilink">capital adequacy ratio</a> that limits the overall credit creation of a bank) set by the relevant <a href="Bank_regulation" title="wikilink">banking regulators</a> in the jurisdiction.</p>

<h3 id="money-multiplier">Money multiplier</h3>

<p> The most common mechanism used to measure this increase in the money supply is typically called the <em>money multiplier</em>. It calculates the <em>maximum</em> amount of money that an initial deposit can be expanded to with a given reserve ratio – such a factor is called a <em>multiplier.</em> And is the maximum amount of money commercial banks can legally create for a given quantity of reserves.</p>

<p>It is calculated as</p>

<p>In the re-lending model, this is alternatively calculated as a <a href="geometric_series" title="wikilink">geometric series</a> under repeated lending of a geometrically decreasing quantity of money: reserves lead loans. In endogenous money models, loans lead reserves, and it is not interpreted as a geometric series. In practice, because banks often have access to lines of credit, and the money market, and can use day time loans from central banks, there is often no requirement for a pre-existing deposit for the bank to create a loan and have it paid to another bank.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>

<p>The money multiplier is of fundamental importance in <a href="monetary_policy" title="wikilink">monetary policy</a>: if banks lend out close to the maximum allowed, then the broad money supply is approximately central bank money times the multiplier, and central banks may finely control broad money supply by controlling central bank money, the money multiplier linking these quantities; this was the case in the United States from 1959 through September 2008.</p>

<p>If, conversely, banks accumulate <a href="excess_reserves" title="wikilink">excess reserves</a>, as occurred in such <a href="Financial_crisis" title="wikilink">financial crises</a> as the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> and the <a href="Financial_crisis_of_2007–2008" title="wikilink">Financial crisis of 2007–2008</a> – in the United States since October 2008, then this equality breaks down, and central bank money creation may not result in commercial bank money creation, instead remaining as unlent (excess) reserves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> However, the central bank may shrink commercial bank money by shrinking central bank money, since reserves are required – thus fractional-reserve money creation is likened to a string, since the central bank can always <em>pull</em> money out by restricting central bank money, hence reserves, but cannot always <em>push</em> money out by expanding central bank money, since this may result in excess reserves, a situation referred to as "<a href="pushing_on_a_string" title="wikilink">pushing on a string</a>".</p>
<h2 id="alternative-theories">Alternative theories</h2>

<p>There are also <a href="heterodox_economics" title="wikilink">heterodox theories</a> of how money is created. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a class="uri" href="Chartalism" title="wikilink">Chartalism</a> sees the state as creating money when it spends, and destroying it when it taxes. More importantly, the private banking system is not, in empirical terms, reserve-limited, so its creation of money is an <a href="Endogenous_money" title="wikilink">endogenous</a> process, driven by credit demand and lending willingness. This accounts for the power of the state's interest rate policy in governing most of the money supply in normal times. <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a></li>
<li><a href="Credit_money" title="wikilink">Credit Theory of Money</a>. This approach was initiated by <a href="Joseph_Schumpeter" title="wikilink">Joseph Schumpeter</a>. Credit theory asserts the central role of banks as creators and allocators of money supply, and distinguishes between "productive credit creation" (allowing non-inflationary <a href="economic_growth" title="wikilink">economic growth</a> even at <a href="full_employment" title="wikilink">full employment</a>, in the presence of <a href="technological_progress" title="wikilink">technological progress</a>) and "unproductive credit creation" (resulting in <a class="uri" href="inflation" title="wikilink">inflation</a> of either the <a href="consumer_price_inflation" title="wikilink">consumer-</a> or <a href="asset_price_inflation" title="wikilink">asset-price</a> variety).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></li>

They can encourage but, without taking drastic action, they cannot <em>compel.</em> For in the middle of a deep depression just when we want Reserve policy to be most effective, the Member Banks are likely to be timid about buying new investments or making loans. If the Reserve authorities buy government bonds in the open market and thereby swell bank reserves, the banks will not put these funds to work but will simply hold reserves.
