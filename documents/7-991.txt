   Quotient category      Quotient category   In mathematics , a quotient category is a category obtained from another one by identifying sets of morphisms . The notion is similar to that of a quotient group or quotient space , but in the categorical setting.  Definition  Let C be a category. A congruence relation  R on C is given by: for each pair of objects X , Y in C , an equivalence relation  R X , Y on Hom( X , Y ), such that the equivalence relations respect composition of morphisms. That is, if        f  1   ,   f  2    :   X  ‚Üí   Y       normal-:    subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2     normal-‚Üí  X  Y     f_{1},f_{2}:X\to Y\,   are related in Hom( X , Y ) and        g  1   ,   g  2    :   Y  ‚Üí   Z       normal-:    subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2     normal-‚Üí  Y  Z     g_{1},g_{2}:Y\to Z\,   are related in Hom( Y , Z ) then g 1 f 1 , g 1 f 2 , g 2 f 1 and g 2 f 2 are related in Hom( X , Z ).  Given a congruence relation R on C we can define the quotient category  C / R as the category whose objects are those of C and whose morphisms are equivalence classes of morphisms in C . That is,         Hom   ùíû  /  ‚Ñõ     (  X  ,  Y  )    =     Hom  ùíû    (  X  ,  Y  )    /   R   X  ,  Y      .         subscript  Hom    ùíû  ‚Ñõ     X  Y         subscript  Hom  ùíû    X  Y     subscript  R   X  Y       \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}/\mathcal{R}}(X,Y)=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,Y)/R_%
 {X,Y}.     Composition of morphisms in C / R is well-defined since R is a congruence relation.  There is also a notion of taking the quotient of an Abelian category  A by a Serre subcategory  B . This is done as follows. The objects of A/B are the objects of A . Given two objects X and Y of A , we define the set of morphisms from X to Y in A/B to be     lim  ‚Üí     Hom  A    (   X  ‚Ä≤   ,   Y  /   Y  ‚Ä≤    )       injective-limit     subscript  Hom  A     superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤     Y   superscript  Y  normal-‚Ä≤        \underrightarrow{\lim}\mathrm{Hom}_{A}(X^{\prime},Y/Y^{\prime})   where the limit is over subobjects     X  ‚Ä≤   ‚äÜ  X       superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤   X    X^{\prime}\subseteq X   and     Y  ‚Ä≤   ‚äÜ  Y       superscript  Y  normal-‚Ä≤   Y    Y^{\prime}\subseteq Y   such that      X  /   X  ‚Ä≤    ,   Y  ‚Ä≤    ‚àà  B         X   superscript  X  normal-‚Ä≤     superscript  Y  normal-‚Ä≤    B    X/X^{\prime},Y^{\prime}\in B   . Then A/B is an Abelian category, and there is a canonical functor    Q  :   A  ‚Üí   A  /  B       normal-:  Q   normal-‚Üí  A    A  B      Q\colon A\to A/B   . This Abelian quotient satisfies the universal property that if C is any other Abelian category, and    F  :   A  ‚Üí  C      normal-:  F   normal-‚Üí  A  C     F\colon A\to C   is an exact functor such that F(b) is a zero object of C for each    b  ‚àà  B      b  B    b\in B   , then there is a unique exact functor     F  ¬Ø   :    A  /  B   ‚Üí  C      normal-:   normal-¬Ø  F    normal-‚Üí    A  B   C     \overline{F}\colon A/B\to C   such that    F  =    F  ¬Ø   ‚àò  Q       F     normal-¬Ø  F   Q     F=\overline{F}\circ Q   . (See [Gabriel].)  Properties  There is a natural quotient functor from C to C / R which sends each morphism to its equivalence class. This functor is bijective on objects and surjective on Hom-sets (i.e. it is a full functor ).  Examples   Monoids and group may be regarded as categories with one object. In this case the quotient category coincides with the notion of a quotient monoid or a quotient group .  The homotopy category of topological spaces  hTop is a quotient category of Top , the category of topological spaces . The equivalence classes of morphisms are homotopy classes of continuous maps.
