Nicotianamine aminotransferase

In enzymology, a nicotianamine aminotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

nicotianamine + 2-oxoglutarate 
 
 
 
  3"-deamino-3"-oxonicotianamine + L-glutamate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are nicotianamine and 2-oxoglutarate, whereas its two products are 3''-deamino-3''-oxonicotianamine and L-glutamate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nicotianamine:2-oxoglutarate aminotransferase; nicotianamine transaminase. Other names in common use include NAAT, NAAT-I, NAAT-II, and NAAT-III.
