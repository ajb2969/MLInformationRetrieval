   Carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase (cytochrome b-561)      Carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase (cytochrome b-561)   In enzymology , a carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase (cytochrome b-561) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CO + H 2 O + 2 ferricytochrome b-561   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CO 2 + 2 H + + 2 ferrocytochrome b-561   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are CO , H 2 O , and ferricytochrome b-561 , whereas its 3 products are CO 2 , H + , and ferrocytochrome b-561 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is carbon monoxide,water:cytochrome b-561 oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include carbon monoxide oxidase , carbon monoxide oxygenase (cytochrome b-561) , carbon monoxide:methylene blue oxidoreductase , CO dehydrogenase , and carbon-monoxide dehydrogenase .
