   Hyperbolic secant distribution      Hyperbolic secant distribution   In probability theory and statistics , the hyperbolic secant distribution is a continuous probability distribution whose probability density function and characteristic function are proportional to the hyperbolic secant function . The hyperbolic secant function is equivalent to the inverse hyperbolic cosine , and thus this distribution is also called the inverse-cosh distribution .  Explanation  A random variable follows a hyperbolic secant distribution if its probability density function (pdf) can be related to the following standard form of density function by a location and shift transformation:        f   (  x  )    =     1  2     sech   (     π  2    x   )      ,        f  x       1  2    sech      π  2   x       f(x)=\frac{1}{2}\;\operatorname{sech}\!\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\,x\right)\!,     where "sech" denotes the hyperbolic secant function. The cumulative distribution function (cdf) of the standard distribution is        F   (  x  )    =    1  2   +    1  π     arctan    [   sinh   (     π  2    x   )    ]       ,        F  x       1  2       1  π      sinh      π  2   x         F(x)=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{\pi}\arctan\!\left[\operatorname{sinh}\!\left(\frac{%
 \pi}{2}\,x\right)\right]\!,           =    2  π     arctan    [   exp   (     π  2    x   )    ]      .      absent      2  π           π  2   x        =\frac{2}{\pi}\arctan\!\left[\exp\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\,x\right)\right]\!.     where "arctan" is the inverse (circular) tangent function . The inverse cdf (or quantile function) is         F   -  1     (  p  )    =   -     2  π     arsinh   [   cot   (    π   p   )    ]       ,         superscript  F    1    p         2  π    arsinh      π  p         F^{-1}(p)=-\frac{2}{\pi}\,\operatorname{arsinh}\!\left[\cot(\pi\,p)\right]\!,           =     2  π      ln    [   tan   (     π  2    p   )    ]      .      absent      2  π           π  2   p        =\frac{2}{\pi}\,\ln\!\left[\tan\left(\frac{\pi}{2}\,p\right)\right]\!.     where "arsinh" is the inverse hyperbolic sine function and "cot" is the (circular) cotangent function .  The hyperbolic secant distribution shares many properties with the standard normal distribution : it is symmetric with unit variance and zero mean , median and mode , and its pdf is proportional to its characteristic function. However, the hyperbolic secant distribution is leptokurtic ; that is, it has a more acute peak near its mean, and heavier tails, compared with the standard normal distribution.  Johnson et al. (1995, p147) place this distribution in the context of a class of generalised forms of the logistic distribution , but use a different parameterisation of the standard distribution compared to that here. Ding (2014) shows three occurrences of the Hyperbolic secant distribution in statistical modeling and inference.  References    J.
