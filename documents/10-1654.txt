   Isobutyryl-CoA mutase      Isobutyryl-CoA mutase   In enzymology , an isobutyryl-CoA mutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-methylpropanoyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   butanoyl-CoA   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-methylpropanoyl-CoA , and one product , butanoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring other groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-methylpropanoyl-CoA CoA-carbonylmutase . Other names in common use include isobutyryl coenzyme A mutase , and butyryl-CoA:isobutyryl-CoA mutase . It has 2 cofactors : cobalt , and Cobamide coenzyme .  References     "  Category:EC 5.4.99  Category:Cobalt enzymes  Category:Cobamide coenzyme enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
