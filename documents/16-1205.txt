Place-permutation action




Place-permutation action

In mathematics, there are two natural interpretations of the place-permutation action of symmetric groups, in which the group elements act on positions or places. Each may be regarded as either a left or a right action, depending on the order in which one chooses to compose permutations. There are just two interpretations of the meaning of "acting by a permutation 
 
 
 
 " but these lead to four variations, depending whether maps are written on the left or right of their arguments. The presence of so many variations often leads to confusion. When regarding the group algebra of a symmetric group as a diagram algebra1 it is natural to write maps on the right so as to compute compositions of diagrams from left to right.
Maps written on the left
First we assume that maps are written on the left of their arguments, so that compositions take place from right to left. Let 
 
 
 
  be the symmetric group2 on 
 
 
 
  letters, with compositions computed from right to left.
Imagine a situation in which elements of 
 
 
 
  act3 on the “places” (i.e., positions) of something. The places could be vertices of a regular polygon of 
 
 
 
  sides, the tensor positions of a simple tensor, or even the inputs of a polynomial of 
 
 
 
  variables. So we have 
 
 
 
  places, numbered in order from 1 to 
 
 
 
 , occupied by 
 
 
 
  objects that we can number 
 
 
 
 . In short, we can regard our items as a word

 
  of length 
 
 
 
  in which the position of each element is significant. Now what does it mean to act by “place-permutation” on 
 
 
 
 ? There are two possible answers:

an element 
 
 
 
  can move the item in the 
 
 
 
 th place to the 
 
 
 
 th place, or
it can do the opposite, moving an item from the 
 
 
 
 th place to the 
 
 
 
 th place.

Each of these interpretations of the meaning of an “action” by 
 
 
 
  (on the places) is equally natural, and both are widely used by mathematicians. Thus, when encountering an instance of a "place-permutation" action one must take care to determine from the context which interpretation is intended, if the author does not give specific formulas.
Consider the first interpretation. The following descriptions are all equivalent ways to describe the rule for the first interpretation of the action:

For each 
 
 
 
 , move the item in the 
 
 
 
 th place to the 
 
 
 
 th place.
For each 
 
 
 
 , move the item in the 
 
 
 
 th place to the 
 
 
 
 th place.
For each 
 
 
 
 , replace the item in the 
 
 
 
 th position by the one that was in the 
 
 
 
 th place.

This action may be written as the rule 
 
 
 
 .
Now if we act on this by another permutation 
 
 
 
  then we need to first relabel the items by writing 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  takes this to 
 
 
 
  This proves that the action is a left action

 
 .
Now we consider the second interpretation of the action of 
 
 
 
 , which is the opposite of the first. The following descriptions of the second interpretation are all equivalent:

For each 
 
 
 
 , move the item in the 
 
 
 
 th place to the 
 
 
 
 th place.
For each 
 
 
 
 , move the item in the 
 
 
 
 th place to the 
 
 
 
 th place.
For each 
 
 
 
 , replace the item in the 
 
 
 
 th position by the one that was in the 
 
 
 
 th place.

This action may be written as the rule 
 
 
 
 .
In order to act on this by another permutation 
 
 
 
 , again we first relabel the items by writing 
 
 
 
 . Then the action of 
 
 
 
  takes this to 
 
 
 
  This proves that our second interpretation of the action is a right action: 
 
 
 
 .
Example
If 
 
 
 
  is the 3-cycle 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the transposition 
 
 
 
 , then since we write maps on the left of their arguments we have 
 
 
 
  Using the first interpretation we have 
 
 
 
 , the result of which agrees with the action of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
 .
On the other hand, if we use the second interpretation, we have 
 
 
 
 , the result of which agrees with the action of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
 .
Maps written on the right
Sometimes people like to write maps on the right4 of their arguments. This is a convenient convention to adopt when working with symmetric groups as diagram algebras, for instance, since then one may read compositions from left to right instead of from right to left. The question is: how does this affect the two interpretations of the place-permutation action of a symmetric group?
The answer is simple. By writing maps on the right instead of on the left we are reversing the order of composition, so in effect we replace 
 
 
 
  by its opposite group

 
 . This is the same group, but the order of compositions is reversed.
Reversing the order of compositions evidently changes left actions into right ones, and vice versa, changes right actions into left ones. This means that our first interpretation becomes a right action while the second becomes a left one.
In symbols, this means that the action 
 
 
 
  is now a right action, while the action 
 
 
 
  is now a left action.
Example
We let 
 
 
 
  be the 3-cycle 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the transposition 
 
 
 
 , as before. Since we now write maps on the right of their arguments we have 
 
 
 
  Using the first interpretation we have 
 
 
 
 , the result of which agrees with the action of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
 .
On the other hand, if we use the second interpretation, we have 
 
 
 
 , the result of which agrees with the action of 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . So 
 
 
 
 .
Summary
In conclusion, we summarize the four possibilities considered in this article. Here are the four variations:




Rule

Type of action









left action







right action







right action







left action



Although there are four variations, it should be emphasized that there are still only two different ways of acting under consideration; the four variations arise from the choice of writing maps on the left or right, a choice which is purely a matter of convention.
