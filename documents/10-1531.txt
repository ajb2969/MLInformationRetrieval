Nicotine dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a nicotine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-nicotine + acceptor + H2O 
 
 
 
  (S)-6-hydroxynicotine + reduced acceptor
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (S)-nicotine, acceptor, and H2O, whereas its two products are (S)-6-hydroxynicotine and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nicotine:acceptor 6-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating). Other names in common use include nicotine oxidase, D-nicotine oxidase, nicotine:(acceptor) 6-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating), and L-nicotine oxidase. It has 2 cofactors: metal, and FMN.
