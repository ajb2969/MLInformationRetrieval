   L-idonate 5-dehydrogenase      L-idonate 5-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a L-idonate 5-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-idonate + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-dehydrogluconate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-idonate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 5-dehydrogluconate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-idonate:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase .
