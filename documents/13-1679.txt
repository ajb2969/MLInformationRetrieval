   Gardner's relation      Gardner's relation   Gardner's relation , or Gardner's equation , named after G. H. F. Gardner and L. W. Gardner, is an empirically derived equation that relates seismic  P-wave velocity to the bulk density of the lithology in which the wave travels. The equation reads:      ρ  =   α   V  p  β        ρ    α   superscript   subscript  V  p   β      \rho=\alpha V_{p}^{\beta}     where   ρ   ρ   \rho   is bulk density given in g/cm 3 ,    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   is P-wave velocity given in ft/s, and   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   are empirically derived constants that depend on the geology . Gardner et al. proposed that one can obtain a good fit by taking    α  =  0.23      α  0.23    \alpha=0.23   and    β  =  0.25      β  0.25    \beta=0.25   . 1 Assuming this, the equation is reduced to:       ρ  =   0.23   V  p  0.25     .      ρ    0.23   superscript   subscript  V  p   0.25      \rho=0.23V_{p}^{0.25}.     If    V  p     subscript  V  p    V_{p}   is measured in m/s,    α  =  0.31      α  0.31    \alpha=0.31   and the equation is:       ρ  =   0.31   V  p  0.25     .      ρ    0.31   superscript   subscript  V  p   0.25      \rho=0.31V_{p}^{0.25}.     This equation is very popular in petroleum exploration because it can provide information about the lithology from interval velocities obtained from seismic data. The constants   α   α   \alpha   and   β   β   \beta   are usually calibrated from sonic and density well log information but in the absence of these, Gardner's constants are a good approximation.
