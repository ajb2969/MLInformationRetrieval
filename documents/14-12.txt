   Bouc–Wen model of hysteresis      Bouc–Wen model of hysteresis  In [[st ructural engineering]], the Bouc–Wen model of hysteresis is used to describe non-linear hysteretic systems. It was introduced by Bouc 1 2 and extended by Wen, 3 who demonstrated its versatility by producing a variety of hysteretic patterns. This model is able to capture, in analytical form, a range of hysteretic cycle shapes matching the behaviour of a wide class of hysteretical systems. Due to its versatility and mathematical tractability, the Bouc–Wen model has gained popularity. It has been extended and applied to a wide variety of engineering problems, including multi-degree-of-freedom (MDOF) systems, buildings, frames, bidirectional and torsional response of hysteretic systems, two- and three-dimensional continua, soil liquefaction and base isolation systems. The Bouc–Wen model, its variants and extensions have been used in structural control—in particular, in the modeling of behaviour of magneto-rheological dampers, base-isolation devices for buildings and other kinds of damping devices . It has also been used in the modelling and analysis of structures built of reinforced concrete , steel , masonry , and timber.  Model formulation  Consider the equation of motion of a single-degree-of-freedom (sdof) system:  here,   m   m   \textstyle m   represents the mass,    u   (  t  )       u  t    \textstyle u(t)   is the displacement,   c   c   \textstyle c   the linear viscous damping coefficient,    F   (  t  )       F  t    \textstyle F(t)   the restoring force and    f   (  t  )       f  t    \textstyle f(t)   the excitation force while the overdot denotes the derivative with respect to time.  According to the Bouc–Wen model, the restoring force is expressed as:   where    a  :=    k  f    k  i       assign  a     subscript  k  f    subscript  k  i      \textstyle a:=\frac{k_{f}}{k_{i}}   is the ratio of post-yield    k  f     subscript  k  f    \textstyle k_{f}   to pre-yield (elastic)     k  i   :=    F  y    u  y       assign   subscript  k  i      subscript  F  y    subscript  u  y      \textstyle k_{i}:=\frac{F_{y}}{u_{y}}   stiffness,    F  y     subscript  F  y    \textstyle F_{y}   is the yield force,    u  y     subscript  u  y    \textstyle u_{y}   the yield displacement, and    z   (  t  )       z  t    \textstyle z(t)   a non-observable hysteretic parameter (usually called the hysteretic displacement ) that obeys the following nonlinear differential equation with zero initial condition (     z   (  0  )    =  0        z  0   0    \textstyle z(0)=0   ), and that has dimensions of length:  or simply as:  where   sign   sign   \textstyle\operatorname{sign}   denotes the signum function, and   A   A   \textstyle A   ,    β  >  0      β  0    \textstyle\beta>0   ,   γ   γ   \textstyle\gamma   and   n   n   \textstyle n   are dimensionless quantities controlling the behaviour of the model (    n  =  ∞      n     \textstyle n=\infty   retrieves the elastoplastic hysteresis). Take into account that in the original paper of Wen (1976), 4    β   β   \textstyle\beta   is called   α   α   \textstyle\alpha   , and   γ   γ   \textstyle\gamma   is called   β   β   \textstyle\beta   . Nowadays the notation varies from paper to paper and very often the places of   β   β   \textstyle\beta   and   γ   γ   \textstyle\gamma   are exchanged. Here the notation used by Ref. 5 is implemented. The restoring force    F   (  t  )       F  t    \textstyle F(t)   can be decomposed into an elastic and a hysteretic part as follows:  and  therefore, the restoring force can be visualized as two springs connected in parallel.  For small values of the positive exponential parameter   n   n   \textstyle n   the transition from elastic to the post-elastic branch is smooth, while for large values that transition is abrupt. Parameters   A   A   \textstyle A   ,   β   β   \textstyle\beta   and   γ   γ   \textstyle\gamma   control the size and shape of the hysteretic loop. It has been found 6 that the parameters of the Bouc–Wen model are functionally redundant. Removing this redundancy is best achieved by setting    A  =  1      A  1    \textstyle A=1   .  Wen 7 assumed integer values for   n   n   \textstyle n   ; however, all real positive values of   n   n   \textstyle n   are admissible. The parameter   β   β   \textstyle\beta   is positive by assumption, while the admissible values for   γ   γ   \textstyle\gamma   , that is    γ  :=   [   -  β   ,  β  ]      assign  γ     β   β     \textstyle\gamma:=[-\beta,\beta]   , can be derived from a thermodynamical analysis (Baber and Wen (1981) 8 ).  Definitions  Some terms are defined below:   Softening : Slope of hysteresis loop decreases with displacement  Hardening : Slope of hysteresis loop increases with displacement  Pinched hysteresis loops : Thinner loops in the middle than at the ends. Pinching is a sudden loss of stiffness, primarily caused by damage and interaction of structural components under a large deformation. It is caused by closing (or unclosed) cracks and yielding of compression reinforcement before closing the cracks in reinforced concrete members, slipping at bolted joints (in steel construction) and loosening and slipping of the joints caused by previous cyclic loadings in timber structures with dowel-type fasteners (e.g. nails and bolts).  Stiffness degradation : Progressive loss of stiffness in each loading cycle  Strength degradation : Degradation of strength when cyclically loaded to the same displacement level. The term "strength degradation" is somewhat misleading, since strength degradation can only be modeled if displacement is the input function.   Absorbed hysteretic energy  Absorbed hysteretic energy represents the energy dissipated by the hysteretic system, and is quantified as the area of the hysteretic force under total displacement; therefore, the absorbed hysteretic energy (per unit of mass ) can be quantified as  that is,  here     ω  2   :=    k  i   m      assign   superscript  ω  2      subscript  k  i   m     \textstyle\omega^{2}:=\frac{k_{i}}{m}   is the squared pseudo-natural frequency of the non-linear system; the units of this energy are     J  /  k   g        J  k   g    \textstyle J/kg   .  Energy dissipation is a good measure of cumulative damage under stress reversals; it mirrors the loading history, and parallels the process of damage evolution. In the Bouc–Wen–Baber–Noori model, this energy is used to quantify system degradation.  Modifications to the original Bouc–Wen model  Bouc–Wen–Baber–Noori model  An important modification to the original Bouc–Wen model was suggested by Baber and Wen (1981) 9 and Baber and Noori (1985, 1986). 10 11  This modification included strength, stiffness and pinching degradation effects, by means of suitable degradation functions:  where the parameters    ν   (  ε  )       ν  ε    \textstyle\nu(\varepsilon)   ,    η   (  ε  )       η  ε    \textstyle\eta(\varepsilon)   and    h   (  z  )       h  z    \textstyle h(z)   are associated (respectively) with the strength, stiffness and pinching degradation effects. The    ν   (  ε  )       ν  ε    \textstyle\nu(\varepsilon)   ,    A   (  ε  )       A  ε    \textstyle A(\varepsilon)   and    η   (  ε  )       η  ε    \textstyle\eta(\varepsilon)   are defined as linearly-increasing functions of absorbed hysteretic energy   ε   ε   \textstyle\varepsilon   :     The pinching function    h   (  z  )       h  z    \textstyle h(z)   is specified as:  where:    and    z  u     subscript  z  u    \textstyle z_{u}   is the ultimate value of   z   z   \textstyle z   , given by  | Eq.13 }}  Observe that the new parameters included in the model are     δ  ν   >  0       subscript  δ  ν   0    \textstyle\delta_{\nu}>0   ,     δ  A   >  0       subscript  δ  A   0    \textstyle\delta_{A}>0   ,     δ  η   >  0       subscript  δ  η   0    \textstyle\delta_{\eta}>0   ,    ν  0     subscript  ν  0    \textstyle\nu_{0}   ,    A  0     subscript  A  0    \textstyle A_{0}   ,    η  0     subscript  η  0    \textstyle\eta_{0}   ,    ψ  0     subscript  ψ  0    \textstyle\psi_{0}   ,    δ  ψ     subscript  δ  ψ    \textstyle\delta_{\psi}   ,   λ   λ   \textstyle\lambda   ,   p   p   \textstyle p   and   ς   ς   \textstyle\varsigma   . When     δ  ν   =  0       subscript  δ  ν   0    \textstyle\delta_{\nu}=0   ,     δ  η   =  0       subscript  δ  η   0    \textstyle\delta_{\eta}=0   or     h   (  z  )    =  1        h  z   1    \textstyle h(z)=1   no strength degradation, stiffness degradation or pinching effect is included in the model.  Foliente (1993) 12 and Heine (2001) 13 slightly altered the pinching function in order to model slack systems. An example of a slack system is a wood structure where displacement occurs with stiffness seemingly null, as the bolt of the structure is pressed into the wood.  Two-degree-of-freedom generalization  A two-degree-of-freedom generalization was defined by Park et al. (1986) 14 to represent the behaviour of a system constituted of a single mass   m   m   \textstyle m   subject to an excitation acting in two orthogonal (perpendicular) directions. For instance, this model is suited to reproduce the geometrically-linear, uncoupled behaviour of a biaxially-loaded, reinforced concrete column .  Wang and Wen modification  Wang and Wen (1998) 15 suggested the following expression to account for the asymmetric peak restoring force :  where   ϕ   ϕ   \textstyle\phi   is an additional parameter, to be determined.  Asymmetrical hysteresis  Asymmetric hysteretical curves appear due to the asymmetry of the mechanical properties of the tested element, of the imposed cycle motion, or of both. Song and Der Kiureghian (2006) 16 proposed the following function for modelling those asymmetric curves:  where:  and  where    β  i     subscript  β  i    \textstyle\beta_{i}   ,    i  =   1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  6       i   1  2  normal-…  6     \textstyle i=1,2,\ldots,6   are six parameters that have to be determined in the identification process. However, according to Ikhouane et al. (2008), 17 the coefficients    β  2     subscript  β  2    \textstyle\beta_{2}   ,    β  3     subscript  β  3    \textstyle\beta_{3}   and    β  6     subscript  β  6    \textstyle\beta_{6}   should be set to zero.  Calculation of the response based on the excitation time-histories  In displacement-controlled experiments , the time history of the displacement    u   (  t  )       u  t    \textstyle u(t)   and its derivative     u  ˙    (  t  )        normal-˙  u   t    \textstyle\dot{u}(t)   are known; therefore, the calculation of the hysteretic variable and restoring force is performed directly using equations  and .  In force-controlled experiments , ,  and  can be transformed in state space form, using the change of variables      x  1    (  t  )    =   u   (  t  )           subscript  x  1   t     u  t     \textstyle x_{1}(t)=u(t)   ,       x  ˙   1    (  t  )    =    u  ˙    (  t  )    =    x  2    (  t  )             subscript   normal-˙  x   1   t      normal-˙  u   t           subscript  x  2   t      \textstyle\dot{x}_{1}(t)=\dot{u}(t)=x_{2}(t)   ,       x  ˙   2    (  t  )    =    u  ¨    (  t  )           subscript   normal-˙  x   2   t      normal-¨  u   t     \textstyle\dot{x}_{2}(t)=\ddot{u}(t)   and      x  3    (  t  )    =   z   (  t  )           subscript  x  3   t     z  t     \textstyle x_{3}(t)=z(t)   as:  and solved using, for example, the Livermore predictor-corrector method, the Rosenbrock methods or the 4th/5th-order Runge–Kutta method . The latter method is more efficient in terms of computational time; the others are slower, but provide a more accurate answer.  The state-space form of the Bouc–Wen–Baber–Noori model is given by:  This is a stiff ordinary differential equation that can be solved, for example, using the function ode15 of MATLAB .  According to Heine (2001), 18 computing time to solve the model and numeric noise is greatly reduced if both force and displacement are the same order of magnitude; for instance, the units kN and mm are good choices.  Analytical calculation of the hysteretic response  The hysteresis produced by the Bouc–Wen model is rate-independent.  can be written as:  = A - \left[\beta\operatorname{sign}(z(t)\dot{u}(t)) + \gamma \right]|z(t)|^n  | Eq.19 }}  where     u  ˙    (  t  )        normal-˙  u   t    \dot{u}(t)   within the   sign   sign   \operatorname{sign}   function serves only as an indicator of the direction of movement. The indefinite integral of Eq.19 can be expressed analytically in terms of the Gauss hypergeometric function      F  1    2     (  a  ,  b  ,  c  ;  w  )        subscript   subscript  F  1   2    a  b  c  w     {}_{2}F_{1}(a,b,c;w)   . Accounting for initial conditions, the following relation holds: 19  where,    q  =    β   sign   (   z   (  t  )    u  ˙    (  t  )    )     +  γ       q      β   sign    z  t   normal-˙  u   t     γ     q=\beta\operatorname{sign}(z(t)\dot{u}(t))+\gamma   is assumed constant for the (not necessarily small) transition under examination,    A  =  1      A  1    A=1   and    u  0     subscript  u  0    u_{0}   ,    z  0     subscript  z  0    z_{0}   are the initial values of the displacement and the hysteretic parameter, respectively. Eq.20 is solved analytically for   z   z   z   for specific values of the exponential parameter   n   n   n   , i.e. for    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   and    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   . 20 For arbitrary values of   n   n   n   , Eq.20 can be solved efficiently using e.g. bisection – type methods, such as the Brent’s method . 21  Parameter constraints and identification  The parameters of the Bouc–Wen model have the following bounds    a  ∈   (  0  ,  1  )       a   0  1     \textstyle a\in(0,1)   ,     k  i   >  0       subscript  k  i   0    \textstyle k_{i}>0   ,     k  f   >  0       subscript  k  f   0    \textstyle k_{f}>0   ,    c  >  0      c  0    \textstyle c>0   ,    A  >  0      A  0    \textstyle A>0   ,    n  >  1      n  1    \textstyle n>1   ,    β  >  0      β  0    \textstyle\beta>0   ,    γ  ∈   [   -  β   ,  β  ]       γ     β   β     \textstyle\gamma\in[-\beta,\beta]   .  As noted above, Ma et al. (2004) 22 proved that the parameters of the Bouc–Wen model are functionally redundant; that is, there exist multiple parameter vectors that produce an identical response from a given excitation. Removing this redundancy is best achieved by setting    A  =  1      A  1    \textstyle A=1   .  Constantinou and Adnane (1987) 23 suggested imposing the constraint     A   β  +  γ    =  1        A    β  γ    1    \textstyle\frac{A}{\beta+\gamma}=1   in order to reduce the model to a formulation with well-defined properties.  Adopting those constraints, the unknown parameters become   γ   γ   \textstyle\gamma   ,   n   n   \textstyle n   ,   a   a   \textstyle a   ,    k  i     subscript  k  i    \textstyle k_{i}   and   c   c   \textstyle c   .  Determination of the model paremeters using experimental input and output data can be accomplished by system identification techniques. The procedures suggested in the literature include:   Optimization based on the least-squares method, (using Gauss–Newton methods, evolutionary algorithms, genetic algorithms, etc.); in this case, the error difference between the time histories or between the short-time-Fourier transforms of the signals is minimized.  Extended Kalman filter , unscented Kalman filter , particle filters  Differential evolution  Genetic algorithms  Particle Swarm Optimization  Adaptive laws  Hybrid methods 24   Once an identification method has been applied to tune the Bouc–Wen model parameters, the resulting model is considered a good approximation of true hysteresis when the error between the experimental data and the output of the model is small enough (from a practical point of view).  Criticism  The hysteretic Bouc–Wen model has received some criticism regarding its ability to accurately describe the phenomenon of hysteresis in materials. Ikhouane and Rodellar (2005) 25 give some insight regarding the behavior of the Bouc–Wen model and provide evidence that the response of the Bouc–Wen model under periodic input is asymptotically periodic.  Charalampakis and Koumousis (2009) 26 propose a modification on the Bouc–Wen model to eliminate displacement drift, force relaxation and nonclosure of hysteretic loops when the material is subjected to short unloading reloading paths resulting to local violation of Drucker's or Ilyushin's postulate of plasticity.
