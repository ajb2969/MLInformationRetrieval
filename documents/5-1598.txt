   Picard group      Picard group   In mathematics , the Picard group of a ringed space  X , denoted by Pic( X ), is the group of isomorphism classes of invertible sheaves (or line bundles) on X , with the group operation being tensor product . This construction is a global version of the construction of the divisor class group, or ideal class group , and is much used in algebraic geometry and the theory of complex manifolds .  Alternatively, the Picard group can be defined as the sheaf cohomology group        H  1    (  X  ,   ùí™  X  *   )    .       superscript  H  1    X   superscript   subscript  ùí™  X        H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*}).\,     For integral schemes the Picard group is isomorphic to the class group of Cartier divisors . For complex manifolds the exponential sheaf sequence gives basic information on the Picard group.  The name is in honour of √âmile Picard 's theories, in particular of divisors on algebraic surfaces .  Examples   The Picard group of the spectrum of a Dedekind domain is its ideal class group .    The invertible sheaves on projective space  P n ( k ) for k a field , are the twisting  sheaves      ùí™   (  m  )    ,      ùí™  m    \mathcal{O}(m),\,   so the Picard group of P n ( k ) is isomorphic to Z .    The Picard group of the affine line with two origins over k is isomorphic to Z .   Picard scheme  The construction of a scheme structure on ( representable functor version of) the Picard group, the Picard scheme , is an important step in algebraic geometry, in particular in the duality theory of abelian varieties . It was constructed by , and also described by  and . The Picard variety is dual to the Albanese variety of classical algebraic geometry.  In the cases of most importance to classical algebraic geometry, for a non-singular  complete variety  V over a field of characteristic zero, the connected component of the identity in the Picard scheme is an abelian variety written Pic 0 ( V ). In the particular case where V is a curve, this neutral component is the Jacobian variety of V . For fields of positive characteristic however, Igusa constructed an example of a smooth projective surface S with Pic 0 ( S ) non-reduced, and hence not an abelian variety .  The quotient Pic( V )/Pic 0 ( V ) is a finitely-generated abelian group denoted NS( V ), the N√©ron‚ÄìSeveri group of V . In other words the Picard group fits into an exact sequence      1  ‚Üí    Pic  0    (  V  )    ‚Üí   Pic   (  V  )    ‚Üí   NS   (  V  )    ‚Üí   0.        normal-‚Üí  1     superscript  Pic  0   V     normal-‚Üí      Pic  V     normal-‚Üí      NS  V     normal-‚Üí    0.     1\to\mathrm{Pic}^{0}(V)\to\mathrm{Pic}(V)\to\mathrm{NS}(V)\to 0.\,     The fact that the rank is finite is Francesco Severi 's theorem of the base ; the rank is the Picard number of V , often denoted œÅ( V ). Geometrically NS( V ) describes the algebraic equivalence classes of divisors on V ; that is, using a stronger, non-linear equivalence relation in place of linear equivalence of divisors , the classification becomes amenable to discrete invariants. Algebraic equivalence is closely related to numerical equivalence , an essentially topological classification by intersection numbers .  Relative Picard scheme  Let f : X ‚Üí S be a morphism of schemes. The relative Picard functor (or relative Picard scheme if it is a scheme) is given by: 1 for any S -scheme T ,        Pic   X  /  S     (  T  )    =     Pic   (   X  T   )    /   f  T  *     (   Pic   (  T  )    )          subscript  Pic    X  S    T        Pic   subscript  X  T     superscript   subscript  f  T       Pic  T      \operatorname{Pic}_{X/S}(T)=\operatorname{Pic}(X_{T})/f_{T}^{*}(\operatorname{%
 Pic}(T))   where     f  T   :    X  T   ‚Üí  T      normal-:   subscript  f  T    normal-‚Üí   subscript  X  T   T     f_{T}:X_{T}\to T   is the base change of f and f T  * is the pullback.  We say an L in     Pic   X  /  S     (  T  )       subscript  Pic    X  S    T    \operatorname{Pic}_{X/S}(T)   has degree r if for any geometric point s ‚Üí T the pullback     s  *   L       superscript  s    L    s^{*}L   of L along s has degree r as an invertible sheaf over the fiber X s (when the degree is defined for the Picard group of X s .)
