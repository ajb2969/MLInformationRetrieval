   L-xylulose reductase      L-xylulose reductase   Dicarbonyl/L-xylulose reductase, also known as carbonyl reductase II, is an enzyme that in human is encoded by the DCXR gene located on chromosome 17.  The DCXR gene encodes a membrane protein that is approximately 34 kDa in size and composed of 224 amino acids. The protein is highly expressed in the kidney and localizes to the cytoplasmic membrane. 1  Function  DCSR catalyzes the reduction of several L-xylylose as well as a number of pentoses, tetroses, trioses, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds. The enzyme is involved in carbohydrate metabolism, glucose metabolism, the uronate cycle and may play a role in the water absorption and cellular osmoregulation in the proximal renal tubules by producing xylitol . 2  In enzymology , an L-xylulose reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   xylitol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-xylulose + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are xylitol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are L-xylulose , NADPH , and H + .  Image:Xylulose.png| Xylulose  Image:Xylitol-2D-structure.svg| Xylitol (Note conversion of ketone to alcohol )  This enzyme belongs to the superfamily of short-chain oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is xylitol:NADP + 2-oxidoreductase (L-xylulose-forming) .  Clinical significance  A deficiency is responsible for pentosuria . The insufficiency of L-xylulose reductase activity causes an inborn error of metabolism disease characterized by excessive urinary excretion of L-xylulose.  Over-expression and ectopic expression of the protein may be associated with prostate adenocarcinoma . 3  References  External links     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of known structure     ↩  ↩  ↩
