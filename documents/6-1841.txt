Beta Columbae

Beta Columbae (β Columbae, β Col) is the second brightest star in the southern constellation of Columba.1 It has the traditional name Wezn (or Wazn), from the Arabic وزن "weight".23 It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.1,4 which is bright enough to be viewed with the naked eye even from an urban location. Parallax measurements place it at a distance of about  from Earth.5
In Chinese,  (), meaning Son, refers to an asterism consisting of β Columbae and λ Columbae.6 Consequently, β Columbae itself is known as  (, .)7
Properties
The spectrum of Beta Columbae matches a stellar classification of K1 IIICN+1,8 where the 'III' luminosity class indicates this is a giant star that has exhausted the supply of hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence of stars like the Sun. The notation 'CN+1' indicates a higher than normal level of cyanogen (CN) absorption in the atmosphere of the star.9 The interferometry-measured angular diameter of this star, after correcting for limb darkening, is ,10 which, at its estimated distance, equates to a physical radius of about 11.5 times the radius of the Sun.11 Despite having expanded to this radius, Beta Columbae only has about a 10% greater mass than the Sun.12 The outer envelope of this star is radiating energy at an effective temperature of 4,545 K,13 resulting an orange hue that is typical of a cool, K-type star.14
Beta Columbae has a high proper motion across the celestial sphere15 and is moving at an unusually large speed of  relative to the Sun.16 About 107,200 years ago, it made a close approach to the Beta Pictoris system. The estimated separation of the two stars at this time was around  and Beta Columbae may have perturbed outlying planetesimals within the debris disk surrounding Beta Pictoris.17
