   Generic matrix ring      Generic matrix ring   In algebra, a generic matrix ring of size n with variables     X  1   ,   …   X  m        subscript  X  1     normal-…   subscript  X  m      X_{1},\dots X_{m}   , denoted by    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   , is a sort of a universal matrix ring . It is universal in the sense that, given a commutative ring R and n -by- n matrices     A  1   ,  …  ,   A  m       subscript  A  1   normal-…   subscript  A  m     A_{1},\dots,A_{m}   over R , any mapping     X  i   ↦   A  i      maps-to   subscript  X  i    subscript  A  i     X_{i}\mapsto A_{i}   extends to the ring homomorphism (called evaluation)     F  n   →    M  n    (  R  )       normal-→   subscript  F  n      subscript  M  n   R     F_{n}\to M_{n}(R)   .  Explicitly, given a field k , it is the subalgebra    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   of the matrix ring     M  n    (  k   [    (   X  l   )    i  j    |  1  ≤  l  ≤  m  ,  1  ≤  i  ,  j  ≤  n  ]   )      fragments   subscript  M  n    fragments  normal-(  k   fragments  normal-[   subscript   fragments  normal-(   subscript  X  l   normal-)     i  j    normal-|  1   l   m  normal-,  1   i  normal-,  j   n  normal-]   normal-)     M_{n}(k[(X_{l})_{ij}|1\leq l\leq m,1\leq i,j\leq n])   generated by n -by- n matrices     X  1   ,  …  ,   X  m       subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  m     X_{1},\dots,X_{m}   , where     (   X  l   )    i  j      subscript   subscript  X  l     i  j     (X_{l})_{ij}   are matrix entries and commute by definition. For example, if m = 1, then    F  1     subscript  F  1    F_{1}   is a polynomial ring in one variable.  For example, a central polynomial is an element of the ring    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   that will map to a central element under an evaluation. (In fact, it is in the invariant ring     k    [    (   X  l   )    i  j    ]     GL  n    (  k  )         k   superscript   delimited-[]   subscript   subscript  X  l     i  j       subscript  GL  n   k      k[(X_{l})_{ij}]^{\operatorname{GL}_{n}(k)}   since it is central and invariant. 1 )  By definition,    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   is a quotient of the free ring    k   ⟨   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  m   ⟩       k    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  m      k\langle t_{1},\dots,t_{m}\rangle   with     t  i   ↦   X  i      maps-to   subscript  t  i    subscript  X  i     t_{i}\mapsto X_{i}   by the ideal consisting of all p that vanish identically on any n -by- n matrices over k . The universal property means that any ring homomorphism from    k   ⟨   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  m   ⟩       k    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  m      k\langle t_{1},\dots,t_{m}\rangle   to a matrix ring factors through    F  n     subscript  F  n    F_{n}   . This has a following geometric meaning. In algebraic geometry, the polynomial ring    k   [  t  ,  …  ,   t  m   ]       k   t  normal-…   subscript  t  m      k[t,\dots,t_{m}]   is the coordinate ring of the affine space    k  m     superscript  k  m    k^{m}   and to give a point of    k  m     superscript  k  m    k^{m}   is to give a ring homomorphism (evaluation)     k   [  t  ,  …  ,   t  m   ]    →  k     normal-→    k   t  normal-…   subscript  t  m     k    k[t,\dots,t_{m}]\to k   (either by the Hilbert nullstellensatz or by the scheme theory ). The free ring    k   ⟨   t  1   ,  …  ,   t  m   ⟩       k    subscript  t  1   normal-…   subscript  t  m      k\langle t_{1},\dots,t_{m}\rangle   plays the role of the coordinate ring of the affine space in the noncommutative algebraic geometry (i.e., we don't demand free variables to commute) and thus a generic matrix ring of size n is the coordinate ring of a noncommutative affine variety whose points are the Spec's of matrix rings of size n (see below for a more concrete discussion.)  The maximum spectrum of a generic matrix ring  For simplicity, assume k is algebraically closed. Let A be an algebra over k and let     Spec  n    (  A  )       subscript  Spec  n   A    \operatorname{Spec}_{n}(A)   denote the set of all maximal ideals   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   in A such that     A  /  𝔪   ≈    M  n    (  k  )          A  𝔪      subscript  M  n   k     A/\mathfrak{m}\approx M_{n}(k)   . If A is commutative, then     Spec  1    (  A  )       subscript  Spec  1   A    \operatorname{Spec}_{1}(A)   is the maximum spectrum of A and     Spec  n    (  A  )       subscript  Spec  n   A    \operatorname{Spec}_{n}(A)   is empty for any    n  >  1      n  1    n>1   .
