   Tree homomorphism      Tree homomorphism   In computer science , a tree homomorphism is a type of homomorphism defined on trees .  Definition  Given a pair of node-labeled trees    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   , a mapping    ϕ   ϕ   \phi   from the nodes of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   to the nodes of    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   is a tree homomorphism if the following conditions hold:      ϕ   ϕ   \phi   maps the root of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   to the root of    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   ,  if node    n  2     subscript  n  2    n_{2}   is a child of node    n  1     subscript  n  1    n_{1}   in    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   , then    ϕ   (   n  2   )       ϕ   subscript  n  2     \phi(n_{2})   is a child of    ϕ   (   n  1   )       ϕ   subscript  n  1     \phi(n_{1})   in    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   , and  for every node    n  ∈   T  1       n   subscript  T  1     n\in T_{1}   , the label of   n   n   n   in    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   is the same as the label of    ϕ   (  n  )       ϕ  n    \phi(n)   in    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   .
