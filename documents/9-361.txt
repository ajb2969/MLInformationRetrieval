Tree homomorphism

In computer science, a tree homomorphism is a type of homomorphism defined on trees.
Definition
Given a pair of node-labeled trees 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , a mapping

 
  from the nodes of 
 
 
 
  to the nodes of 
 
 
 
  is a tree homomorphism if the following conditions hold:



 
  maps the root of 
 
 
 
  to the root of 
 
 
 
 ,
if node 
 
 
 
  is a child of node 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a child of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , and
for every node 
 
 
 
 , the label of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is the same as the label of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
