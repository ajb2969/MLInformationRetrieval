   Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations      Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations   In physics , specifically general relativity , the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations describe the motion of a spinning massive object, moving in a gravitational field . Other equations with similar names and mathematical forms are the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations and Papapetrou-Dixon equations . All three sets of equations describe the same physics.  They are named for M. Mathisson , 1  W. G. Dixon , 2 and A. Papapetrou . 3  Throughout, this article uses the natural units  c = G = 1, and tensor index notation .  For a particle of mass m , the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations are: 4 5  {ds} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}u^\pi S^{\rho\sigma} R^\lambda{}_{\pi\rho\sigma}        D   S   μ  ν      d  s    +    u  μ    u  σ     D   S   ν  σ      d  s      -    u  ν    u  σ     D   S   μ  σ      d  s      =  0              D   superscript  S    μ  ν       d  s       superscript  u  μ    subscript  u  σ       D   superscript  S    ν  σ       d  s         superscript  u  ν    subscript  u  σ       D   superscript  S    μ  σ       d  s      0    \frac{DS^{\mu\nu}}{ds}+u^{\mu}u_{\sigma}\frac{DS^{\nu\sigma}}{ds}-u^{\nu}u_{%
