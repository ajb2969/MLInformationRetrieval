Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations

In physics, specifically general relativity, the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations describe the motion of a spinning massive object, moving in a gravitational field. Other equations with similar names and mathematical forms are the Mathisson-Papapetrou equations and Papapetrou-Dixon equations. All three sets of equations describe the same physics.
They are named for M. Mathisson,1 W. G. Dixon,2 and A. Papapetrou.3
Throughout, this article uses the natural units c = G = 1, and tensor index notation.
For a particle of mass m, the Mathisson–Papapetrou–Dixon equations are:45
{ds} \right) = -\frac{1}{2}u^\pi S^{\rho\sigma} R^\lambda{}_{\pi\rho\sigma}

where: u is the four velocity (1st order tensor), S the spin tensor (2nd order), R the Riemann curvature tensor (4th order), and the capital "D" indicates the covariant derivative with respect to the particle's proper time s (an affine parameter).
Mathisson–Papapetrou equations
For a particle of mass m, the Mathisson–Papapetrou equations are:67
{ds} + u^\mu u_\sigma \frac{DS^{\nu\sigma}}{ds} - u^\nu u_\sigma \frac{DS^{\mu\sigma}}{ds} = 0 |cellpadding= 6 |border = 1 |border colour = black |background colour=white}}
using the same symbols as above.
