   Hollow matrix      Hollow matrix   In mathematics , a hollow matrix may refer to one of several related classes of matrix .  Sparse  A hollow matrix may be one with "few" non-zero entries: that is, a sparse matrix . 1  Diagonal entries all zero  A hollow matrix may be a square matrix whose diagonal elements are all equal to zero . 2 The most obvious example is the real  skew-symmetric matrix. Other examples are the adjacency matrix of a finite simple graph ; a distance matrix or Euclidean distance matrix .  If A is an n × n hollow matrix, then the elements of A are given by         A   n  ×  n      =      (   a   i  j    )   ;         a   i  j      =    0        if  i   =  j   ,    1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  n     .          subscript  A    n  n      subscript  a    i  j     missing-subexpression      subscript  a    i  j     0   formulae-sequence     if  i   j    formulae-sequence    1  i     j  n        \begin{array}[]{rlll}A_{n\times n}&=&(a_{ij});\\
 a_{ij}&=&0&\mbox{if}\quad i=j,\quad 1\leq i,j\leq n.\end{array}     In other words, any square matrix which takes the form    (     0           0           ⋱           0           0     )      0   missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression      missing-subexpression   0   missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression      missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression   normal-⋱   missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression      missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression   0   missing-subexpression      missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression   0     \left(\begin{array}[]{ccccc}0\\
 &0\\
 &&\ddots\\
 &&&0\\
 &&&&0\end{array}\right)   is a hollow matrix.  For example:    (     0    2    6     1  3     4      2    0    4    8    0      9    4    0    2    933      1    4    4    0    6      7    9    23    8    0     )      0  2  6    1  3   4    2  0  4  8  0    9  4  0  2  933    1  4  4  0  6    7  9  23  8  0     \left(\begin{array}[]{ccccc}0&2&6&\frac{1}{3}&4\\
 2&0&4&8&0\\
 9&4&0&2&933\\
 1&4&4&0&6\\
 7&9&23&8&0\end{array}\right)   is an example of a hollow matrix.  Properties   The trace of A is trivially zero.    The linear map represented by A (with respect to a fixed basis) maps each basis vector e onto the image of the complement of .    Gershgorin's Circle Theorem shows that the moduli of the eigenvalues of A are equal to the sum of the moduli of the non-diagonal row entries.   Block of zeroes  A hollow matrix may be a square n × n matrix with an r × s block of zeroes where r + s > n . 3  References  "  Category:Matrices     ↩  ↩  ↩
