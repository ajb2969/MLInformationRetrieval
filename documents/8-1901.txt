Hollow matrix

In mathematics, a hollow matrix may refer to one of several related classes of matrix.
Sparse
A hollow matrix may be one with "few" non-zero entries: that is, a sparse matrix.1
Diagonal entries all zero
A hollow matrix may be a square matrix whose diagonal elements are all equal to zero .2 The most obvious example is the real skew-symmetric matrix. Other examples are the adjacency matrix of a finite simple graph; a distance matrix or Euclidean distance matrix.
If A is an n×n hollow matrix, then the elements of A are given by



In other words, any square matrix which takes the form 
 
 
 
   is a hollow matrix.
For example: 
 
 
 
   is an example of a hollow matrix.
Properties

The trace of A is trivially zero.


The linear map represented by A (with respect to a fixed basis) maps each basis vector e onto the image of the complement of .


Gershgorin's Circle Theorem shows that the moduli of the eigenvalues of A are equal to the sum of the moduli of the non-diagonal row entries.

Block of zeroes
A hollow matrix may be a square n×n matrix with an r×s block of zeroes where r+s>n.3
