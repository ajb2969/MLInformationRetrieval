Antiquity
 The original Semitic letter may have been inspired by an Egyptian hieroglyph for tp, "head". It was used for  by Semites because in their language, the word for "head" was rêš (also the name of the letter). It developed into Greek 'Ρ'  (rhô) and Latin R.
The descending stroke develops as a graphic variant in some Western Greek alphabets (writing rho as ), but it was not adopted in most Old Italic alphabets; most Old Italic alphabets show variants of their rho between a "P" and a "D" shape, but without the Western Greek descending stroke. Indeed, the oldest known forms of the Latin alphabet itself of the 7th to 6th centuries BC, in the Duenos and the Forum inscription, still write r using the "P" shape of the letter. The Lapis Satricanus inscription shows the form of the Latin alphabet around 500 BC. Here, the rounded, closing Π shape of the p and the Ρ shape of the r have become difficult to distinguish. The descending stroke of the Latin letter R has fully developed by the 3rd century BC, as seen in the Tomb of the Scipios sarcophagus inscriptions of that era. At the same time, the letter P could now be written with its loop fully closed, assuming the shape formerly taken by R.
Cursive
 
The minuscule (lowercase) form (r) developed through several variations on the capital form. Along with Latin minuscule writing in general, it developed ultimately from Roman cursive via the uncial script of Late Antiquity into the Carolingian minuscule of the 9th century.
In handwriting, it was common not to close the bottom of the loop but continue into the leg, saving an extra pen stroke. The loop-leg stroke shortened into the simple arc used in the Carolingian minuscule and until today. 
A calligraphic minuscule r, known as r rotunda (ꝛ), was used in the sequence or, bending the shape of the r to accommodate the bulge of the o (as in oꝛ as opposed to or). Later, the same variant was also used where r followed other lower case letters with a rounded loop towards the right (such as b, h, p) and to write the geminate rr (as ꝛꝛ). Use of r rotunda was mostly tied to blackletter typefaces, and the glyph fell out of use along with blackletter fonts, in English language contexts mostly by the 18th century.
Insular script used a minuscule which retained two downward stroke, but which did not close the loop ("Insular r", ꞃ); this variant survives in the Gaelic type popular in Ireland until the mid 20th century (but now mostly limited to decorative purposes).
Name
The name of the letter in Latin was er (), following the pattern of other letters representing continuants, such as F, L, M, N and S. This name is preserved in French and many other languages. In Middle English, the name of the letter changed from  to , following a pattern exhibited in many other words such as farm (compare French ferme), and star (compare German Stern).
The letter R is sometimes referred to as the littera canina (canine letter). This phrase has Latin origins: the Latin R was trilled to sound like a growling dog. A good example of a trilling R is the Spanish word for dog, perro.2
In William Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet, such a reference is made by Juliet's nurse in Act 2, scene 4, when she calls the letter R "the dog's name". The reference is also found in Ben Jonson's English Grammar.3
Usage
The letter R is the eighth most common letter in English and the fourth-most common consonant (after 't', 'n', and 's').4 R represents a rhotic consonant in many languages, as shown in the table below. The International Phonetic Alphabet uses several variations of the letter to represent the different rhotic consonants;  represents the alveolar trill.




Alveolar trill 

Listen

some dialects of British English or in emphatic speech, standard Dutch, Finnish, Galician, German in some dialects, Hungarian, Icelandic, Italian, Czech, Lithuanian, Latvian, Latin, Norwegian mostly in the northwest, Polish, Catalan, Portuguese (traditional form), Romanian, Scots, Slovak, Spanish and Albanian 'rr', Swedish, Welsh



Alveolar approximant 

Listen

English (most varieties), Dutch in some Dutch dialects (in specific positions of words), Faroese, Sicilian



Alveolar flap / Alveolar tap 

Listen

Portuguese, Catalan, Spanish and Albanian 'r', Turkish, Dutch, Italian, Venetian, Galician, Leonese, Norwegian, Irish



Voiced retroflex fricative 

Listen

Norwegian around Tromsø, Spanish used as an allophone of /r/ in some South American accents



Retroflex approximant 

Listen

some English dialects (in America, South West England, and Dublin), Gutnish



Retroflex flap 

Listen

Norwegian when followed by , sometimes in Scottish English



Uvular trill 

Listen

German stage standard; some Dutch dialects (in Brabant and Limburg, and some city dialects in The Netherlands), Swedish in Southern Sweden, Norwegian in western and southern parts



Voiced uvular fricative 

Listen

German, Danish, French, standard European Portuguese 'rr', standard Brazilian Portuguese 'rr', Puerto Rican Spanish 'rr' and 'r-', Norwegian in western and southern parts.



Other languages may use the letter 'r' in their alphabets (or Latin transliterations schemes) to represent rhotic consonants different from the alveolar trill. In Haitian Creole, it represents a sound so weak that it is often written interchangeably with 'w', e.g. 'Kweyol' for 'Kreyol'.
Brazilian Portuguese has a great number of allophones of  such as , , , , ,  and , the latter three ones can be used only in certain contexts ( and  as 'rr';  in the syllable coda, as an allophone of  according to the European Portuguese norm and  according to the Brazilian Portuguese norm). Usually at least two of them are present in a single dialect, such as Rio de Janeiro's , ,  and, for a few speakers, .
In science, the letter R is a symbol for the gas constant. Mathematicians use 'R' or 
 
 
 
  (an R in blackboard bold, displayed as  in Unicode) for the set of all real numbers.
The letter R is used both inside and outside American English with the letter E to form the ending: "-re", which is used in certain words such as centre. In American English, the "-re" ending is used, but the letters that make up the "-re" ending are inverted, making certain words that use the "-re" ending look like this: center. Pronunciation of words that use "-re" is not affected, because in British English, said word mentioned (centre) uses the same pronunciation as its American English variant.
