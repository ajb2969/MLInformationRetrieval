   Acyclic object      Acyclic object   In mathematics , in the field of homological algebra , given an abelian category    𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   having enough injectives and an additive (covariant) functor      F  :   𝒞  →  𝒟      normal-:  F   normal-→  𝒞  𝒟     F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}   ,  an acyclic object with respect to   F   F   F   , or simply an   F   F   F   -acyclic object, is an object   A   A   A   in   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   such that        R  i   F   (  A  )    =  0         superscript  normal-R  i   F  A   0    {\rm R}^{i}F(A)=0\,\!   for all    i  >  0      i  0    i>0\,\!   ,  where     R  i   F       superscript  normal-R  i   F    {\rm R}^{i}F   are the right derived functors of   F   F   F   .
