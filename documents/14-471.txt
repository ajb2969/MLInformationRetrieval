   QUADPACK      QUADPACK   QUADPACK is a FORTRAN 77  library for numerical integration of one-dimensional functions. 1 It was included in the SLATEC Common Mathematical Library and is therefore in the public domain . 2 The individual subprograms are also available on netlib . 3  The GNU Scientific Library reimplemented the QUADPACK routines in C . SciPy provides a Python interface to QUADPACK. 4 5  Routines  The main focus of QUADPACK is on automatic integration routines in which the user inputs the problem and an absolute or relative error  tolerance and the routine attempts to perform the integration with an error no larger than that requested. There are nine such automatic routines in QUADPACK, in addition to a number of non-automatic routines. All but one of the automatic routines use adaptive quadrature . 6      Summary of naming scheme for automatic routines 7   1st letter   2nd letter   3rd letter   4th letter        Q   Quadrature         N   Non-adaptive     A   Adaptive         G   General integrand     W   Weight function of specified form          Simple integrator     S   Singularities handled     P   Specified points of local difficulty (singularities, discontinuities …)     I   Infinite interval     O   Oscillatory weight function (cos or sin) over a finite interval     F   Fourier transform (cos or sin)     C   Cauchy principal value        Each of the adaptive routines also have versions suffixed by E that have an extended parameter list that provides more information and allows more control. Double precision versions of all routines were released with prefix D.  General-purpose routines  The two general-purpose routines most suitable for use without further analysis of the integrand are QAGS for integration over a finite interval and QAGI for integration over an infinite interval . 8 These two routines are used in GNU Octave (the quad command) 9 and R (the integrate function). 10   QAGS : uses global adaptive quadrature based on 21-point Gauss–Kronrod quadrature within each subinterval, with acceleration by Peter Wynn 's epsilon algorithm . 11 12 QAGI : is the only general-purpose routine for infinite intervals, and maps the infinite interval onto the semi-open interval (0,1] using a transformation then uses the same approach as QAGS, except with 15-point rather than 21-point Gauss–Kronrod quadrature. 13 For an integral over the whole real line, the transformation used is    x  =    (   1  -  t   )   /  t       x      1  t   t     x=(1-t)/t   : 14        \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} f(x) dx = \int_0^1 {dt\over t^2} \left(f\left(\frac{1-t}{t}\right) + f\left(-\frac{1-t}{t}\right)\right) \;.   This is not be the best approach for all integrands: another transformation may be appropriate, or one might prefer to break up the original interval and use QAGI only on the infinite part. 15    Brief overview of the other automatic routines   QNG : simple non-adaptive integrator QAG : simple adaptive integrator QAGP : similar to QAGS but allows user to specify locations of internal singularities, discontinuities etc. QAWO : integral of    c  o  s   (   ω  x   )   f   (  x  )       c  o  s    ω  x   f  x    cos(ωx)f(x)   or    s  i  n   (   ω  x   )   f   (  x  )       s  i  n    ω  x   f  x    sin(ωx)f(x)   over a finite interval QAWF : Fourier transform QAWS : integral of    w   (  x  )   f   (  x  )       w  x  f  x    w(x)f(x)   from   a   a   a   to   b   b   b   , where   f   f   f   is smooth and ( x – a ) α ( b – x ) β log k ( x – a ) log l ( b – x )}} , with     k  ,  l   =   0  o  r  1        k  l     0  o  r  1     k,l=0or1   and     α  ,  β   >   –  1        α  β     normal-–  1     α,β>–1    QAWC : Cauchy principal value of the integral of     f   (  x  )    /   (   x  –  c   )         f  x     x  normal-–  c     f(x)/(x–c)   for user-specified   c   c   c   and   f   f   f    16   See also   List of numerical libraries   References    Further reading      "  Category:Numerical software  Category:Fortran libraries  Category:Numerical integration (quadrature)      ↩  ↩   ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩   ↩   ↩  ↩
