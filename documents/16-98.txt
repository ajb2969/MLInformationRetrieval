   Ent-isokaurene synthase      Ent-isokaurene synthase   Ent-isokaurene synthase (, OsKSL5i , OsKSL6 ) is an enzyme with system name ent-copalyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, ent-isokaurene-forming) . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ent-copalyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ent-isokaurene + diphosphate    Two enzymes of the rice sub-species Oryza sativa ssp. indica, OsKSL5 and OsKSL6, produce ent-isokaurene.
