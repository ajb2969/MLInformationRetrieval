HOL Light

HOL Light is a member of the HOL theorem prover family. Like the other members, it is a proof assistant for classical higher order logic. Compared with other HOL systems, HOL Light is intended to have relatively simple foundations. HOL Light is authored and maintained by the mathematician and computer scientist John Harrison. HOL Light is released under the simplified BSD license.1
Logical foundations
HOL Light is based on a formulation of type theory with equality as the only primitive notion. The primitive rules of inference are the following:








REFL

reflexivity of equality







TRANS

transitivity of equality







MK_COMB

congruence of equality







ABS

abstraction of equality (
 
 
 
  must not be free in 
 
 
 
 )







BETA

connection of abstraction and function application







ASSUME

assuming 
 
 
 
 , prove 
 
 








EQ_MP

relation of equality and deduction







DEDUCT_ANTISYM_RULE

deduce equality from 2-way deducibility







INST

instantiate variables in assumptions and conclusion of theorem







INST_TYPE

instantiate type variables in assumptions and conclusion of theorem



This formulation of type theory is very close to the one described in section II.2 of .
