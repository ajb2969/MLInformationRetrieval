   Pyruvate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)      Pyruvate dehydrogenase (cytochrome)   In enzymology , a pyruvate dehydrogenase (cytochrome) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   pyruvate + ferricytochrome b 1 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + CO 2 + ferrocytochrome b 1    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are pyruvate , ferricytochrome b1 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are acetate , CO 2 , and ferrocytochrome b1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is pyruvate:ferricytochrome-b1 oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include pyruvate dehydrogenase , pyruvic dehydrogenase , pyruvic (cytochrome b1) dehydrogenase , pyruvate:ubiquinone-8-oxidoreductase , and pyruvate oxidase (ambiguous) . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Thiamin diphosphate .
