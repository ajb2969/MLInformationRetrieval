Glycerophosphoinositol glycerophosphodiesterase

In enzymology, a glycerophosphoinositol glycerophosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-(sn-glycero-3-phospho)-1D-myo-inositol + H2O 
 
 
 
  myo-inositol + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-(sn-glycero-3-phospho)-1D-myo-inositol and H2O, whereas its two products are myo-inositol and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(sn-glycero-3-phospho)-1D-myo-inositol glycerophosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include sn-glycero(3)phosphoinositol glycerophosphohydrolase, and sn-glycero-3-phospho-1-inositol glycerophosphohydrolase.
