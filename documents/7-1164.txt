Quadratic form (statistics)

In multivariate statistics, if 
 
 
 
  is a vector of 
 
 
random variables, and 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -dimensional symmetric matrix, then the scalar quantity 
 
 
 
  is known as a quadratic form in 
 
 
 
 .
Expectation
It can be shown that1



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the expected value and variance-covariance matrix of 
 
 
 
 , respectively, and tr denotes the trace of a matrix. This result only depends on the existence of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ; in particular, normality of 
 
 
 
  is not required.
A book treatment of the topic of quadratic forms in random variables is 2
Proof
Since the quadratic form is a scalar quantity 
 
 
 
 . Note that both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are linear operators, so 
 
 
 
 . It follows that


 
  and that, by the cyclic property of the trace operator,



Variance
In general, the variance of a quadratic form depends greatly on the distribution of 
 
 
 
 . However, if 
 
 
does follow a multivariate normal distribution, the variance of the quadratic form becomes particularly tractable. Assume for the moment that 
 
 
 
  is a symmetric matrix. Then,



In fact, this can be generalized to find the covariance between two quadratic forms on the same 
 
 
 
  (once again, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  must both be symmetric):



Computing the variance in the non-symmetric case
Some texts incorrectly state that the above variance or covariance results hold without requiring 
 
 
 
  to be symmetric. The case for general 
 
 
 
  can be derived by noting that



so



But this is a quadratic form in the symmetric matrix 
 
 
 
 , so the mean and variance expressions are the same, provided 
 
 
 
  is replaced by 
 
 
 
  therein.
Examples of quadratic forms
In the setting where one has a set of observations 
 
 
 
  and an operator matrix

 
 , then the residual sum of squares can be written as a quadratic form in 
 
 
 
 :



For procedures where the matrix 
 
 
 
  is symmetric and idempotent, and the errors are Gaussian with covariance matrix 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  has a chi-squared distribution with 
 
 
 
  degrees of freedom and noncentrality parameter 
 
 
 
 , where






may be found by matching the first two central moments of a noncentral chi-squared random variable to the expressions given in the first two sections. If 
 
 
 
  estimates 
 
 
 
  with no bias, then the noncentrality 
 
 
 
  is zero and 
 
 
 
  follows a central chi-squared distribution.
