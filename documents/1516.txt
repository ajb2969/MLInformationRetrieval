   Quasi-algebraically closed field      Quasi-algebraically closed field   In mathematics , a field  F is called quasi-algebraically closed (or C 1 ) if every non-constant homogeneous polynomial  P over F has a non-trivial zero provided the number of its variables is more than its degree. The idea of quasi-algebraically closed fields was investigated by C. C. Tsen , a student of Emmy Noether , in a 1936 paper ; and later by Serge Lang in his 1951 Princeton University dissertation and in his 1952 paper . The idea itself is attributed to Lang's advisor Emil Artin .  Formally, if P is a non-constant homogeneous polynomial in variables   X 1 , ..., X N ,   and of degree d satisfying   d < N    then it has a non-trivial zero over F ; that is, for some x i in F , not all 0, we have   P ( x 1 , ..., x N ) = 0.   In geometric language, the hypersurface defined by P , in projective space of degree N − 2, then has a point over F .  Examples   Any algebraically closed field is quasi-algebraically closed. In fact, any homogeneous polynomial in at least two variables over an algebraically closed field has a non-trivial zero. 1  Any finite field is quasi-algebraically closed by the Chevalley–Warning theorem . 2 3 4  Algebraic function fields over algebraically closed fields are quasi-algebraically closed by Tsen's theorem . 5 6  The maximal unramified extension of a complete field with a discrete valuation and a perfect residue field is quasi-algebraically closed. 7  A complete field with a discrete valuation and an algebraically closed residue field is quasi-algebraically closed by a result of Lang. 8 9  A pseudo algebraically closed field of characteristic zero is quasi-algebraically closed. 10   Properties   Any algebraic extension of a quasi-algebraically closed field is quasi-algebraically closed.  The Brauer group of a finite extension of a quasi-algebraically closed field is trivial. 11 12 13  A quasi-algebraically closed field has cohomological dimension at most 1. 14   C k fields  Quasi-algebraically closed fields are also called C 1 . A C k field , more generally, is one for which any homogeneous polynomial of degree d in N variables has a non-trivial zero, provided   d k < N ,   for k ≥ 1. 15 The condition was first introduced and studied by Lang. 16 If a field is C i then so is a finite extension. 17 18 The C 0 fields are precisely the algebraically closed fields. 19 20  Lang and Nagata proved that if a field is C k , then any extension of transcendence degree  n is C k + n . 21 22 23 The smallest k such that K is a C k field (   ∞     \infty   if no such number exists), is called the diophantine dimension  dd ( K ) of K . 24  C 2 fields  Every finite field is C 2 . 25  Properties  Suppose that the field k is C 2 .   Any skew field D finite over k as centre has the property that the reduced norm  D ∗ → k ∗ is surjective. 26  Every quadratic form in 5 or more variables over k is isotropic . 27   Artin's conjecture  Artin conjectured that p -adic fields were C 2 , but Guy Terjanian found p -adic counterexamples for all p . 28 29 The Ax–Kochen theorem applied methods from model theory to show that Artin's conjecture was true for Q p with p large enough (depending on d ).  Weakly C k fields  A field K is weakly C k , d if for every homogeneous polynomial of degree d in N variables satisfying   d k < N    the Zariski closed set V ( f ) of P n ( K ) contains a subvariety which is Zariski closed over K .  A field which is weakly C k , d for every d is weakly C k . 30  Properties   A C k field is weakly C k . 31  A perfect PAC weakly C k field is C k . 32  A field K is weakly C k , d if and only if every form satisfying the conditions has a point x defined over a field which is a primary extension of K . 33  If a field is weakly C k , then any extension of transcendence degree n is weakly C k + n . 34    Any extension of an algebraically closed field is weakly C 1 . 35  Any field with procyclic absolute Galois group is weakly C 1 . 36  Any field of positive characteristic is weakly C 2 . 37    If the field of rational numbers is weakly C 1 , then every field is weakly C 1 . 38   See also   Brauer's theorem on forms  Tsen rank   Citations  References              "  Category:Field theory  Category:Diophantine geometry     Fried & Jarden (2008) p.455 ↩  Fried & Jarden (2008) p.456 ↩  Serre (1979) p.162 ↩  Gille & Szamuley (2006) p.142 ↩   Gille & Szamuley (2006) p.143 ↩    Gille & Szamuley (2006) p.144 ↩  Fried & Jarden (2008) p.462 ↩  Lorenz (2008) p.181 ↩  Serre (1979) p.161 ↩  Gille & Szamuely (2006) p.141 ↩   Serre (1997) p.87 ↩    Lang (1997) p.245 ↩   Lorenz (2008) p.116 ↩  Lorenz (2008) p.119 ↩  Serre (1997) p.88 ↩  Fried & Jarden (2008) p.459 ↩  ↩     ↩  Lang (1997) p.247 ↩     Fried & Jarden (2008) p.457 ↩      Fried & Jarden (2008) p.461 ↩
