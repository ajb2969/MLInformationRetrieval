   Eilenberg–Ganea theorem      Eilenberg–Ganea theorem   In mathematics , particularly in homological algebra and algebraic topology , the Eilenberg–Ganea theorem states for every finitely generated group G with certain conditions on its cohomological dimension (namely 3 ≤ cd( G ) ≤ n ), one can construct an aspherical  CW complex  X of dimension n whose fundamental group is G . The theorem is named after Polish mathematician Samuel Eilenberg and Romanian mathematician Tudor Ganea . The theorem was first published in a short paper in 1957 in the Annals of Mathematics . 1  Definitions  Group cohomology: Let G be a group and X = K ( G , 1) is the corresponding Eilenberg−MacLane space . Then we have the following singular chain complex which is a free resolution of Z over the group ring  Z [ G ] (where Z is a trivial Z [ G ] module).       ⋯   →    δ  n   +  1      C  n    (  E  )     →   δ  n      C   n  -  1     (  E  )    →  ⋯  →    C  1    (  E  )     →   δ  1      C  0    (  E  )     →  𝜀   Z  →  0   ,           subscript  δ  n   1   normal-→   normal-⋯     subscript  C  n   E       subscript  δ  n   normal-→        subscript  C    n  1    E     normal-→    normal-⋯    normal-→       subscript  C  1   E       subscript  δ  1   normal-→        subscript  C  0   E      ε  normal-→     Z    normal-→    0     \cdots\xrightarrow{\delta_{n}+1}C_{n}(E)\xrightarrow{\delta_{n}}C_{n-1}(E)%

 \xrightarrow{\varepsilon}Z\rightarrow 0,     where E is the universal cover of X and C k ( E ) is the free abelian group generated by singular k chains. Group cohomology of the group G with coefficient in G module M is the cohomology of this chain complex with coefficient in M and is denoted by H * ( G , M ).  Cohomological dimension:  G has cohomological dimension n with coefficients in Z (denoted by cd Z ( G )) if       n  =   sup   {  k  :    There exists a  Z   [  G  ]   module  M  with   H  k    (  G  ,  M  )    ≠  0   }     .      n   supremum   conditional-set  k      There exists a  Z   delimited-[]  G   module  M  with   superscript  H  k    G  M    0       n=\sup\{k:\text{There exists a }Z[G]\text{ module }M\text{ with }H^{k}(G,M)%
 \neq 0\}.     Fact: If G has a projective resolution of length ≤ n , i.e. Z as trivial Z [ G ] module has a projective resolution of length ≤ n if and only if H i Z ( G , M ) = 0 for all Z module M and for all i > n .  Therefore we have an alternative definition of cohomological dimension as follows,  Cohomological dimension of G with coefficient in  Z  is the smallest n (possibly infinity) such that G has a projective resolution of length  n , i.e.  Z  has a projective resolution of length  n  as a trivial  Z [ G ] module.  Eilenberg−Ganea theorem  Let G be a finitely presented group and n ≥ 3 be an integer. Suppose cohomological dimension of G with coefficients in Z , i.e. cd Z ( G ) ≤ n . Then there exists an n -dimensional aspherical  CW complex  X such that the fundamental group of X is G i.e. π 1 ( X ) = G .  Converse  Converse of this theorem is an consequence of cellular homology , and the fact that every free module is projective.  Theorem: Let X be an aspherical n -dimensional CW complex with π 1 ( X ) = G , then cd Z ( G ) ≤ n .  Related results and conjectures  For n = 1 the result is one of the consequences of Stallings theorem about ends of groups . 2  Theorem: Every finitely generated group of cohomological dimension one is free.  For n = 2 the statement is known as Eilenberg–Ganea conjecture .  Eilenberg−Ganea Conjecture: If a group G has cohomological dimension 2 then there is a 2-dimensional aspherical CW complex X with π 1 ( X ) = G .  It is known that given a group G with cd Z ( G ) = 2 there exists a 3-dimensional aspherical CW complex X with π 1 ( X ) = G .
