   Recurrent tensor      Recurrent tensor   In mathematics, a recurrent tensor , with respect to a connection    ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   on a manifold  M , is a tensor  T for which there is a one-form  ω on M such that        ∇  T   =   ω  ⊗  T    .       normal-∇  T    tensor-product  ω  T     \nabla T=\omega\otimes T.\,     Examples  Parallel Tensors  An example for recurrent tensors are parallel tensors which are defined by       ∇  A   =  0       normal-∇  A   0    \nabla A=0   with respect to some connection   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   .  If we take a pseudo-Riemannian manifold     (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   then the metric g is a parallel and therefore recurrent tensor with respect to its Levi-Civita connection , which is defined via        ∇   L  C    g   =  0        superscript  normal-∇    L  C    g   0    \nabla^{LC}g=0   and its property to be torsion-free.  Parallel vector fields (     ∇  X   =  0       normal-∇  X   0    \nabla X=0   ) are examples of recurrent tensors that find importance in mathematical research. For example, if   X   X   X   is a recurrent non-null vector field on a pseudo-Riemannian manifold satisfying       ∇  X   =   ω  ⊗  X        normal-∇  X    tensor-product  ω  X     \nabla X=\omega\otimes X   for some closed one-form    ω   ω   \omega   , then X can be rescaled to a parallel vector field. 1 In particular, non-parallel recurrent vector fields are null vector fields.  Metric space  Another example appears in connection with Weyl structures . Historically, Weyl structures emerged from the considerations of Hermann Weyl with regards to properties of parallel transport of vectors and their length. 2 By demanding that a manifold have an affine parallel transport in such a way that the manifold is locally an affine space , it was shown that the induced connection had a vanishing torsion tensor        T  ∇    (  X  ,  Y  )    =     ∇  X   Y   -    ∇  Y   X   -   [  X  ,  Y  ]    =  0           superscript  T  normal-∇    X  Y        subscript  normal-∇  X   Y     subscript  normal-∇  Y   X    X  Y         0     T^{\nabla}(X,Y)=\nabla_{X}Y-\nabla_{Y}X-[X,Y]=0   . Additionally, he claimed that the manifold must have a particular parallel transport in which the ratio of two transported vectors is fixed. The corresponding connection    ∇  ′     superscript  normal-∇  normal-′    \nabla^{\prime}   which induces such a parallel transport satisfies        ∇  ′   g   =   φ  ⊗  g         superscript  normal-∇  normal-′   g    tensor-product  φ  g     \nabla^{\prime}g=\varphi\otimes g   for some one-form   φ   φ   \varphi   . Such a metric is a recurrent tensor with respect to    ∇  ′     superscript  normal-∇  normal-′    \nabla^{\prime}   . As a result, Weyl called the resulting manifold    (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   with affine connection   ∇   normal-∇   \nabla   and recurrent metric   g   g   g   a metric space. In this sense, Weyl was not just referring to one metric but to the conformal structure defined by   g   g   g   .  Under the conformal transformation    g  →    e  λ   g      normal-→  g     superscript  e  λ   g     g\rightarrow e^{\lambda}g   , the form   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   transforms as    φ  →   φ  -   d  λ       normal-→  φ    φ    d  λ      \varphi\rightarrow\varphi-d\lambda   . This induces a canonical map    F  :    [  g  ]   →    Λ  1    (  M  )        normal-:  F   normal-→   delimited-[]  g      superscript  normal-Λ  1   M      F:[g]\rightarrow\Lambda^{1}(M)   on    (  M  ,   [  g  ]   )     M   delimited-[]  g     (M,[g])   defined by       F   (    e  λ   g   )    :=   φ  -   d  λ       assign    F     superscript  e  λ   g      φ    d  λ      F(e^{\lambda}g):=\varphi-d\lambda   , where    [  g  ]     delimited-[]  g    [g]   is the conformal structure.   F   F   F   is called a Weyl structure, 3 which more generally is defined as a map with property       F   (    e  λ   g   )    =    F   (  g  )    -   d  λ          F     superscript  e  λ   g        F  g     d  λ      F(e^{\lambda}g)=F(g)-d\lambda   .  Recurrent spacetime  One more example of a recurrent tensor is the curvature tensor   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   on a recurrent spacetime, 4 for which       ∇  ℛ   =   ω  ⊗  ℛ        normal-∇  ℛ    tensor-product  ω  ℛ     \nabla\mathcal{R}=\omega\otimes\mathcal{R}   .
