Alveolar gas equation

The partial pressure of oxygen (pO2) in the pulmonary alveoli is required to calculate both the alveolar-arterial gradient of oxygen and the amount of right-to-left cardiac shunt, which are both clinically useful quantities. However it is not practical to take a sample of gas from the alveoli in order to directly measure the partial pressure of oxygen. The alveolar gas equation allows the calculation of the alveolar partial pressure of oxygen from data that is practically measurable. It was first characterized in 1946.1
Assumptions
The equation relies on the following assumptions:

Inspired gas contains no carbon dioxide (CO2) or water
Nitrogen (and any other gases except oxygen) in the inspired gas are in equilibrium with their dissolved states in the blood
Inspired and alveolar gases obey the ideal gas law
Carbon dioxide (CO2) in the alveolar gas is in equilibrium with the arterial blood i.e. that the alveolar and arterial partial pressures are equal
The alveolar gas is saturated with water

Equation



If FIO2 is small, or more specifically if


 then the equation can be simplified to:
