   Heegner's lemma      Heegner's lemma   In mathematics , Heegner's lemma is a lemma used by Kurt Heegner in his paper on the class number problem . His lemma states that if       y  2   =     a  4    x  4    +    a  3    x  3    +    a  2    x  2    +    a  1   x   +    a  0          superscript  y  2        subscript  a  4    superscript  x  4       subscript  a  3    superscript  x  3       subscript  a  2    superscript  x  2       subscript  a  1   x    subscript  a  0      y^{2}=a_{4}x^{4}+a_{3}x^{3}+a_{2}x^{2}+a_{1}x+a_{0}\,     is a curve over a field with a 4 not a square, then it has a solution if it has a solution in an extension of odd degree.
