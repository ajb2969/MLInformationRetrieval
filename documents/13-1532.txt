RSA/Intuitive

Intuitive Proof
The algorithm is based on a Fermat's little theorem


 
  p prime, a & p coprime.
So, if we choose d such that


 
  i.e.


 
  Then for a message m



So a message that is encrypted by raising m to e can be decrypted by raising the result to d.
In order to provide security, RSA actually calculates


 
  (p, q prime) and then d such that


 
  so



We can then continue to calculate



And likewise for q



Now if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 , p, q coprime.
so



An attacker would need to factor n into p and q in order to determine d, and this is a hard problem.
Note that while an attacker could easily calculate f as


 
  that



because n is not prime.
