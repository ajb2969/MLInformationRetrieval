   Tail sequence      Tail sequence   In mathematics , specifically set theory , a tail sequence is an unbounded sequence of contiguous ordinals. Formally, let β be a limit ordinal . Then a γ-sequence    s  ≡    ⟨   s  α   |   α   <  γ  ⟩        s     bra   subscript  s  α    α   delimited-<⟩  γ      s\equiv\langle s_{\alpha}|\alpha<\gamma\rangle   is a tail sequence in β if there exists an ε \beta \setminus \epsilon.
