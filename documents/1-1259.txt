   Circuit reliability      Circuit reliability   Circuit reliability (also time availability ) ( CiR ) is the percentage of time an electronic circuit was available for use in a specified period of scheduled availability . Circuit reliability is given by where T  o is the circuit total outage time, T s is the circuit total scheduled time, and T  a is the circuit total available time .     T  s   =    T  a   +   T  o         subscript  T  s      subscript  T  a    subscript  T  o      T_{s}=T_{a}+T_{o}     In addition, circuit reliability is the expected lifespan of operation of a functioning system under nominal conditions.
