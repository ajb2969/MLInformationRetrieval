   Itakura–Saito distance      Itakura–Saito distance   The Itakura–Saito distance (or Itakura–Saito divergence ) is a measure of the difference between an original spectrum    P   (  ω  )       P  ω    P(\omega)   and an approximation     P  ^    (  ω  )        normal-^  P   ω    \hat{P}(\omega)   of that spectrum. Although it is not a perceptual measure it is intended to reflect perceptual (dis)similarity. It was proposed by Fumitada Itakura and Shuzo Saito in the 1960s while they were with NTT . 1  The distance is defined as: 2        D   I  S     (   P   (  ω  )    ,    P  ^    (  ω  )    )    =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π     [     P   (  ω  )      P  ^    (  ω  )     -   log    P   (  ω  )      P  ^    (  ω  )      -  1   ]   d  ω            subscript  D    I  S       P  ω      normal-^  P   ω         1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π      delimited-[]        P  ω      normal-^  P   ω          P  ω      normal-^  P   ω     1    d  ω       D_{IS}(P(\omega),\hat{P}(\omega))=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}\left[\frac{P%
 (\omega)}{\hat{P}(\omega)}-\log\frac{P(\omega)}{\hat{P}(\omega)}-1\right]\,d\omega     The Itakura–Saito distance is a Bregman divergence , but is not a true metric since it is not symmetric 3 and it does not fulfil triangle inequality.  In Non-negative matrix factorization the Itakura-Saito divergence can be used as a measure of the quality of the factorization: this implies a meaningful statistical model of the components and can be solved through an iterative method. 4  See also   Log-spectral distance   References  "  Category:Signal processing     Itakura, F., & Saito, S.
