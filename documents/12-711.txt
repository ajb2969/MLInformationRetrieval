   Time-inhomogeneous hidden Bernoulli model      Time-inhomogeneous hidden Bernoulli model   Time-inhomogeneous hidden Bernoulli model (TI-HBM) is an alternative to hidden Markov model (HMM) for automatic speech recognition . Contrary to HMM, the state transition process in TI-HBM is not a Markov-dependent process , rather it is a generalized Bernoulli (an independent) process. This difference leads to elimination of dynamic programming at state-level in TI-HBM decoding process. Thus, the computational complexity of TI-HBM for probability evaluation and state estimation is    O   (   N  L   )       O    N  L     O(NL)   (instead of    O   (    N  2   L   )       O     superscript  N  2   L     O(N^{2}L)   in the HMM case, where   N   N   N   and   L   L   L   are number of states and observation sequence length respectively). The TI-HBM is able to model acoustic-unit duration (e.g. phone/word duration) by using a built-in parameter named survival probability. The TI-HBM is simpler and faster than HMM in a phoneme recognition task, but its performance is comparable to HMM.  For details, see 1 or 2 .  References  [1] Jahanshah Kabudian, M.
