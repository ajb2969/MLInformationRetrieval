List of triangle inequalities


For the basic inequality a < b + c, see Triangle inequality.

For inequalities of acute or obtuse triangles, see Acute and obtuse triangles.


In geometry, triangle inequalities are inequalities involving the parameters of triangles, that hold for every triangle. The inequalities give an ordering of two different values: they are of the form "less than", "less than or equal to", "greater than", or "greater than or equal to". The parameters in a triangle inequality can be the side lengths, the semiperimeter, the angle measures, the values of trigonometric functions of those angles, the area of the triangle, the medians of the sides, the altitudes, the lengths of the internal angle bisectors from each angle to the opposite side, the perpendicular bisectors of the sides, the distance from an arbitrary point to another point, the inradius, the exradii, the circumradius, and/or other quantities.
Unless otherwise specified, this article deals with triangles in the Euclidean plane.
Main parameters and notation
The parameters most commonly appearing in triangle inequalities are:

the side lengths a, b, and c;


the semiperimeter s = (a + b + c) / 2 (half the perimeter p);


the angle measures A, B, and C of the angles of the vertices opposite the respective sides a, b, and c (with the vertices denoted with the same symbols as their angle measures);


the values of trigonometric functions of the angles;


the area T of the triangle;


the medians ma, mb, and mc of the sides (each being the length of the line segment from the midpoint of the side to the opposite vertex);


the altitudes ha, hb, and hc (each being the length of a segment perpendicular to one side and reaching from that side (or possibly the extension of that side) to the opposite vertex);


the lengths of the internal angle bisectors ta, tb, and tc (each being a segment from a vertex to the opposite side and bisecting the vertex's angle);


the perpendicular bisectors pa, pb, and pc of the sides (each being the length of a segment perpendicular to one side at its midpoint and reaching to one of the other sides);


the lengths of line segments with an endpoint at an arbitrary point P in the plane (for example, the length of the segment from P to vertex A is denoted PA or AP);


the inradius r (radius of the circle inscribed in the triangle, tangent to all three sides), the exradii ra, rb, and rc (each being the radius of an excircle tangent to side a, b, or c respectively and tangent to the extensions of the other two sides), and the circumradius R (radius of the circle circumscribed around the triangle and passing through all three vertices).

If angle C is obtuse (greater than 90°) then



if C is acute (less than 90°) then



The in-between case of equality when C is a right angle is the Pythagorean theorem.
In general,7



with equality approached in the limit only as the apex angle of an isosceles triangle approaches 180°.
If the centroid of the triangle is inside the triangle's incircle, then8



While all of the above inequalities are true because a, b, and c must follow the basic triangle inequality that the longest side is less than half the perimeter, the following relations hold for all positive a, b, and c:9



each holding with equality only when a = b = c. This says that in the non-equilateral case the harmonic mean of the sides is less than their geometric mean which in turn is less than their arithmetic mean.

and likewise for angles B, C, with equality in the first part if the triangle is isosceles and the apex angle is at least 60° and equality in the second part if and only if the triangle is isosceles with apex angle no greater than 60°.24
Further, any two angle measures A and B opposite sides a and b respectively are related according to25



which is related to the isosceles triangle theorem and its converse, which state that A = B if and only if a = b.
By Euclid's exterior angle theorem, any exterior angle of a triangle is greater than either of the interior angles at the opposite vertices:26

Area
The isoperimetric inequality for triangles in terms of perimeter p and area T states that

Ono's inequality for acute triangles (those with all angles less than 90°) is



The area of the triangle can be compared to the area of the incircle:

If an inner triangle is inscribed in a reference triangle so that the inner triangle's vertices partition the perimeter of the reference triangle into equal length segments, the ratio of their areas is bounded by40



Let the interior angle bisectors of A, B, and C meet the opposite sides at D, E, and F. Then41



Medians and centroid
The three medians

 
  of a triangle each connect a vertex with the midpoint of the opposite side, and the sum of their lengths satisfies42



Moreover,43



with equality only in the equilateral case, and for inradius r,44



If we further denote the intersections of the extended medians with the circumcircle as Ma , Mb , and Mc , then45



The centroid G is the intersection of the medians. Let AG, BG, and CG meet the circumcircle at U, V, and W respectively. Then both46



and



in addition,47



For an acute triangle we have48

Denoting as IA, IB, IC the distances of the incenter from the vertices, the following holds:49



The three medians of any triangle can form the sides of another triangle:50



and



In addition, if

We also have52



For internal angle bisectors ta, tb, tc from vertices A, B, C and circumcenter R and incenter r, we have53



The reciprocals of the altitudes of any triangle can themselves form a triangle:54



Internal angle bisectors and incenter
The internal angle bisectors are segments in the interior of the triangle reaching from one vertex to the opposite side and bisecting the vertex angle into two equal angles. The angle bisectors ta etc. satisfy



in terms of the sides, and



in terms of the altitudes and medians, and likewise for tb and tc .55 Further,56



in terms of the medians.
Let Ta , Tb , and Tc be the lengths of the angle bisectors extended to the circumcircle. Then57

for circumradius R and inradius r, again with equality only in the equilateral case. In addition,.59



For incenter I (the intersection of the internal angle bisectors),60



For midpoints L, M, N of the sides,61



For incenter I, centroid G, circumcenter O, nine-point center N, and orthocenter H, we have for non-equilateral triangles the distance inequalities62



and we have the angle inequality63



In addition,64

Since these triangles have the indicated obtuse angles, we have



and in fact the second of these is equivalent to a result stronger than the first, shown by Euler:6667



The larger of two angles of a triangle has the shorter internal angle bisector:68


 
  we have69



and



Segments from an arbitrary point
Consider any point P in the interior of the triangle, with the triangle's vertices denoted A, B, and C and with the lengths of line segments denoted PA etc. We have70



and more strongly71



We also have72



and likewise for cyclic permutations of the vertices.
If we draw perpendiculars from P to the sides of the triangle, intersecting the sides at D, E, and F, we have73



Further, the Erdős–Mordell inequality states that74 75



with equality in the equilateral case. More strongly, Barrow's inequality states that if the interior bisectors of the angles at P (namely, of ∠APB, ∠BPC, and ∠CPA) intersect the triangle's sides at U, V, and W, then76



Again with distances PD, PE, PF of the interior point P from the sides we have these three inequalities:77









For interior point P with distances PA, PB, PC from the vertices and with triangle area T,78



and79

Moreover, for positive numbers k1, k2, k3, and t with t less than or equal to 1:82



while for t > 1 we have83



There are various inequalities for an arbitrary interior or exterior point in the plane in terms of the radius r of the triangle's inscribed circle. For example,84



Others include:85

also in terms of the semiperimeter.99100 In the latter double inequality, the first part holds with equality if and only if the triangle is isosceles with an apex angle of at least 60°, and the last part holds with equality if and only if the triangle is isosceles with an apex angle of at most 60°. Thus both are equalities if and only if the triangle is equilateral.101
Further,


102
Blundon's inequality states that103



For incircle center I, let AI, BI, and CI extend beyond I to intersect the circumcircle at D, E, and F respectively. Then104



In terms of the vertex angles we have 105



Circumradius and other lengths
For the circumradius R we have106



and107 



We also have108









in terms of the altitudes,



in terms of the medians, and109



in terms of the area.
Moreover, for circumcenter O, let lines AO, BO, and CO intersect the opposite sides BC, CA, and AB at U, V, and W respectively. Then110



For an acute triangle the distance between the circumcenter O and the orthocenter H satisfies111



with the opposite inequality holding for an obtuse triangle.
Inradius, exradii, and other lengths
For the inradius r we have112






in terms of the altitudes, and



in terms of the radii of the excircles. We additionally have


113
and


114
The exradii and medians are related by115



In addition, for an acute triangle the distance between the incircle center I and orthocenter H satisfies116



with the reverse inequality for an obtuse triangle.
Also, an acute triangle satisfies117



in terms of the circumradius R, again with the reverse inequality holding for an obtuse triangle.
If the internal angle bisectors of angles A, B, C meet the opposite sides at U, V, W then118



If the internal angle bisectors through incenter I extend to meet the circumcircle at X, Y and Z then 119



for circumradius R, and120121



If the incircle is tangent to the sides at D, E, F, then122



for semiperimeter s.
Inscribed hexagon
If a tangential hexagon is formed by drawing three segments tangent to a triangle's incircle and parallel to a side, so that the hexagon is inscribed in the triangle with its other three sides coinciding with parts of the triangle's sides, then123



Inscribed triangle
If three points D, E, F on the respective sides AB, BC, and CA of a reference triangle ABC are the vertices of an inscribed triangle, which thereby partitions the reference triangle into four triangles, then the area of the inscribed triangle is greater than the area of at least one of the other interior triangles, unless the vertices of the inscribed triangle are at the midpoints of the sides of the reference triangle (in which case the inscribed triangle is the medial triangle and all four interior triangles have equal areas):124



Inscribed squares
An acute triangle has three inscribed squares, each with one side coinciding with part of a side of the triangle and with the square's other two vertices on the remaining two sides of the triangle. (A right triangle has only two distinct inscribed squares.) If one of these squares has side length xa and another has side length xb with xa b, then125



Moreover, for any square inscribed in any triangle we have126127



Euler line
A triangle's Euler line goes through its orthocenter, its circumcenter, and its centroid, but does not go through its incenter unless the triangle is isosceles.128 For all non-isosceles triangles, the distance d from the incenter to the Euler line satisfies the following inequalities in terms of the triangle's longest median v, its longest side u, and its semiperimeter s:129



For all of these ratios, the upper bound of 1/3 is the tightest possible.130
Right triangle
In right triangles the legs a and b and the hypotenuse c obey the following, with equality only in the isosceles case:131



In terms of the inradius, the hypotenuse obeys132



and in terms of the altitude from the hypotenuse the legs obey133



Isosceles triangle
If the two equal sides of an isosceles triangle have length a and the other side has length c, then the internal angle bisector t from one of the two equal-angled vertices satisfies134



Equilateral triangle
For any point P in the plane of an equilateral triangle ABC, the distances of P from the vertices, PA, PB, and PC, are such that, unless P is on the triangle's circumcircle, they obey the basic triangle inequality and thus can themselves form the sides of a triangle:135



However, when P is on the circumcircle the sum of the distances from P to the nearest two vertices exactly equals the distance to the farthest vertex.
A triangle is equilateral if and only if, for every point P in the plane, with distances PD, PE, and PF to the triangle's sides and distances PA, PB, and PC to its vertices,136








Two triangles
Pedoe's inequality for two triangles, one with sides a, b, and c and area T, and the other with sides d, e, and f and area S, states that
$$d^2(b^2+c^2-a^2)+e^2(a^2+c^2-b^2)+f^2(a^2+b^2-c^2)\geq 16TS,\,$$
with equality if and only if the two triangles are similar.
The hinge theorem or open-mouth theorem states that if two sides of one triangle are congruent to two sides of another triangle, and the included angle of the first is larger than the included angle of the second, then the third side of the first triangle is longer than the third side of the second triangle. That is, in triangles ABC and DEF with sides a, b, c, and d, e, f respectively (with a opposite A etc.), if a = d and b = e and angle C > angle F, then
$$c>f.$$
The converse also holds: if c > f, then C > F.
The angles in any two triangles ABC and DEF are related in terms of the cotangent function according to137
$$\cot A (\cot E + \cot F) + \cot B(\cot F+\cot D) + \cot C(\cot D + \cot E) \geq 2.$$
