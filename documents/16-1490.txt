   Draft:Bock's Parametrization      Draft:Bock's Parametrization   Bock's parametrization is an empirical fitting formula giving the longitudinal energy loss of a high energy particle producing a hadronic shower in an iron -like calorimeter as a function of its depth. The formula was published by Rudolf K. Bock , Traudl Hansl-Kozanecka and T. P. Shah in 1981. 1  Formula  Consider a particle of energy   E   E   E   travelling through a calorimeter consisting of a material with radiation length     X  0     subscript  X  0    X_{0}   and nuclear interaction length    λ   λ   \lambda   . The energy lost by the particle as a function of its depth into the calorimeter   x   x   x   is       Δ  E   (  x  )    =   E   [    w  G   (  a  ,    b  x   /   X  0    )    +    (   1  -  w   )   G   (  c  ,    d  x   /  λ   )     ]          normal-Δ  E  x     E   delimited-[]      w  G   a      b  x    subscript  X  0          1  w   G   c      d  x   λ          \Delta E(x)=E\left[wG(a,bx/X_{0})+(1-w)G(c,dx/\lambda)\right]     where       G   (  q  ,  p  )    =     ∫  0  p     t   q  -  1      e   -  t     d  t      ∫  0  ∞     t   q  -  1      e   -  t     d  t           G   q  p        superscript   subscript   0   p      superscript  t    q  1     superscript  e    t    d  t      superscript   subscript   0        superscript  t    q  1     superscript  e    t    d  t       G(q,p)=\frac{\int_{0}^{p}t^{q-1}e^{-t}\,\text{d}t}{\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{q-1}e^{%
 -t}\,\text{d}t}     and     a   a   \displaystyle a     with   E   E   E   in GeV. The actual energy of the particle at any position is    E  -   Δ  E   (  x  )        E    normal-Δ  E  x     E-\Delta E(x)   . An equivalent definition is     G   (  q  ,  p  )    =     γ   (  q  ,  p  )    /  Γ    (  q  )          G   q  p          γ   q  p    normal-Γ   q     G(q,p)=\gamma(q,p)/\Gamma(q)   where    γ   (  q  ,  p  )       γ   q  p     \gamma(q,p)   is the lower incomplete gamma function and    Γ   (  q  )       normal-Γ  q    \Gamma(q)   is the gamma function .  Limitations  This formula is only valid when   contributions from the lateral energy distribution can be ignored  the energy of the particles is large (at least 10 GeV)  the calorimeter material has a similar radiation length and interaction length as iron (the material with which the fit was calibrated)   References  "     ↩
