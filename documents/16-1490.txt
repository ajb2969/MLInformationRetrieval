Draft:Bock's Parametrization

Bock's parametrization is an empirical fitting formula giving the longitudinal energy loss of a high energy particle producing a hadronic shower in an iron-like calorimeter as a function of its depth. The formula was published by Rudolf K. Bock, Traudl Hansl-Kozanecka and T. P. Shah in 1981.1
Formula
Consider a particle of energy 
 
 
 
  travelling through a calorimeter consisting of a material with radiation length

 
  and nuclear interaction length

 
 . The energy lost by the particle as a function of its depth into the calorimeter 
 
 
 
  is



where



and



with 
 
 
 
  in GeV. The actual energy of the particle at any position is 
 
 
 
 . An equivalent definition is 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the lower incomplete gamma function and 
 
 
 
 
  is the gamma function.
Limitations
This formula is only valid when

contributions from the lateral energy distribution can be ignored
the energy of the particles is large (at least 10 GeV)
the calorimeter material has a similar radiation length and interaction length as iron (the material with which the fit was calibrated)
