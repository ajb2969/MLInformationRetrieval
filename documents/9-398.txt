   Buckley–Leverett equation      Buckley–Leverett equation   In fluid dynamics , the Buckley–Leverett equation is a conservation equation used to model two-phase flow in porous media . 1 The Buckley–Leverett equation or the Buckley–Leverett displacement can be interpreted as a way of incorporating the microscopic effects due to capillary pressure in two-phase flow into Darcy's law .  In a 1D sample ( control volume ), let    S   (  x  ,  t  )       S   x  t     S(x,t)   be the water saturation , then the Buckley–Leverett equation is        ∂  S    ∂  t    =   U   (  S  )     ∂  S    ∂  x             S     t      U  S      S     x       \frac{\partial S}{\partial t}=U(S)\frac{\partial S}{\partial x}     where        U   (  S  )    =    Q   ϕ  A      d  f    d  S      .        U  S       Q    ϕ  A        normal-d  f     normal-d  S       U(S)=\frac{Q}{\phi A}\frac{\mathrm{d}f}{\mathrm{d}S}.      f   f   f   is the fractional flow rate,   Q   Q   Q   is the total flow,   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is porosity and   A   A   A   is area of the cross-section in the sample volume.  Assumptions for validity  The Buckley–Leverett equation is derived for a 1D sample given   mass conservation  capillary pressure      p  c    (  S  )        subscript  p  c   S    p_{c}(S)   is a function of water saturation    S   S   S   only         d   p  c    /  d   S   =  0            normal-d   subscript  p  c    normal-d   S   0    \mathrm{d}p_{c}/\mathrm{d}S=0   causing the pressure gradients of the two phases to be equal.  Flow is Linear  Flow is Steady-State  Formation is one Layer   General solution  The solution of the Buckley–Leverett equation has the form     S   (  x  ,  t  )    =   S   (   x  +   U   (  S  )   t    )          S   x  t      S    x    U  S  t       S(x,t)=S(x+U(S)t)   which means that    U   (  S  )       U  S    U(S)   is the front velocity of the fluids at saturation   S   S   S   .
