Buckley–Leverett equation

In fluid dynamics, the Buckley–Leverett equation is a conservation equation used to model two-phase flow in porous media.1 The Buckley–Leverett equation or the Buckley–Leverett displacement can be interpreted as a way of incorporating the microscopic effects due to capillary pressure in two-phase flow into Darcy's law.
In a 1D sample (control volume), let 
 
 
 
  be the water saturation, then the Buckley–Leverett equation is



where



 
 
  is the fractional flow rate, 
 
 
 
  is the total flow, 
 
 
 
  is porosity and 
 
 
 
  is area of the cross-section in the sample volume.
Assumptions for validity
The Buckley–Leverett equation is derived for a 1D sample given

mass conservation
capillary pressure

 
  is a function of water saturation

 
 
  only


 
  causing the pressure gradients of the two phases to be equal.
Flow is Linear
Flow is Steady-State
Formation is one Layer

General solution
The solution of the Buckley–Leverett equation has the form 
 
 
 
  which means that 
 
 
 
  is the front velocity of the fluids at saturation 
 
 
 
 .
