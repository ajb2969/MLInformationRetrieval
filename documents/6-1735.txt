   Fredholm alternative      Fredholm alternative   In mathematics , the Fredholm alternative , named after Ivar Fredholm , is one of Fredholm's theorems and is a result in Fredholm theory . It may be expressed in several ways, as a theorem of linear algebra , a theorem of integral equations , or as a theorem on Fredholm operators . Part of the result states that a non-zero complex number in the spectrum of a compact operator is an eigenvalue.  Linear algebra  If V is an n -dimensional vector space and    T  :   V  →  V      normal-:  T   normal-→  V  V     T:V\to V   is a linear transformation , then exactly one of the following holds:   For each vector v in V there is a vector u in V so that     T   (  u  )    =  v        T  u   v    T(u)=v   . In other words: T is surjective (and so also bijective, since V is finite-dimensional).       dim   (   ker   (  T  )    )    >  0       dimension   kernel  T    0    \dim(\ker(T))>0   .   A more elementary formulation, in terms of matrices, is as follows. Given an m × n matrix A and a m ×1 column vector b , exactly one of the following must hold:   Either:  A  x = b has a solution x  Or:  A T  y = 0 has a solution y with y T b ≠ 0.   In other words, A  x = b has a solution    (   𝐛  ∈   Im   (  A  )     )      𝐛   Im  A     (\mathbf{b}\in\operatorname{Im}(A))   if and only if for any y s.t. A T  y = 0, y T b = 0    (  𝐛  ∈  ker    (   A  T   )   ⊥   )     fragments  normal-(  b   kernel   superscript   fragments  normal-(   superscript  A  T   normal-)   bottom   normal-)    (\mathbf{b}\in\ker(A^{T})^{\bot})   .  Integral equations  Let    K   (  x  ,  y  )       K   x  y     K(x,y)   be an integral kernel , and consider the homogeneous equation , the Fredholm integral equation ,        λ  φ   (  x  )    -    ∫  a  b    K   (  x  ,  y  )   φ   (  y  )   d  y     =  0          λ  φ  x     superscript   subscript   a   b     K   x  y   φ  y  d  y     0    \lambda\varphi(x)-\int_{a}^{b}K(x,y)\varphi(y)\,dy=0     and the inhomogeneous equation         λ  φ   (  x  )    -    ∫  a  b    K   (  x  ,  y  )   φ   (  y  )   d  y     =   f   (  x  )     .          λ  φ  x     superscript   subscript   a   b     K   x  y   φ  y  d  y       f  x     \lambda\varphi(x)-\int_{a}^{b}K(x,y)\varphi(y)\,dy=f(x).     The Fredholm alternative is the statement that, for every non-zero fixed complex number     λ  ∈  ℂ      λ  ℂ    \lambda\in\mathbb{C}   , either the first equation has a non-trivial solution, or the second equation has a solution for all    f   (  x  )       f  x    f(x)   .  A sufficient condition for this statement to be true is for    K   (  x  ,  y  )       K   x  y     K(x,y)   to be square integrable on the rectangle     [  a  ,  b  ]   ×   [  a  ,  b  ]        a  b    a  b     [a,b]\times[a,b]   (where a and/or b may be minus or plus infinity). The integral operator defined by such a K is called a Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator .  Functional analysis  Results on the Fredholm operator generalize these results to vector spaces of infinite dimensions, Banach spaces .  The integral equation can be reformulated in terms of operator notation as follows. Write (somewhat informally)      T  =   λ  -  K       T    λ  K     T=\lambda-K     to mean       T   (  x  ,  y  )    =     λ   δ   (   x  -  y   )    -   K   (  x  ,  y  )           T   x  y        λ  δ    x  y      K   x  y       T(x,y)=\lambda\;\delta(x-y)-K(x,y)     with    δ   (   x  -  y   )       δ    x  y     \delta(x-y)   the Dirac delta function , considered as a distribution , or generalized function , in two variables. Then by convolution , T induces a linear operator acting on a Banach space V of functions    ϕ   (  x  )       ϕ  x    \phi(x)   , which we also call T , so that      T  :   V  →  V      normal-:  T   normal-→  V  V     T:V\to V     is given by      ϕ  ↦  ψ     maps-to  ϕ  ψ    \phi\mapsto\psi     with   ψ   ψ   \psi   given by        ψ   (  x  )    =    ∫  a  b    T   (  x  ,  y  )   ϕ   (  y  )   d  y    =     λ   ϕ   (  x  )    -    ∫  a  b    K   (  x  ,  y  )   ϕ   (  y  )   d  y      .          ψ  x     superscript   subscript   a   b     T   x  y   ϕ  y  d  y             λ  ϕ  x     superscript   subscript   a   b     K   x  y   ϕ  y  d  y        \psi(x)=\int_{a}^{b}T(x,y)\phi(y)\,dy=\lambda\;\phi(x)-\int_{a}^{b}K(x,y)\phi(%
 y)\,dy.     In this language, the Fredholm alternative for integral equations is seen to be analogous to theFredholm alternative for finite-dimensional linear algebra.  The operator K given by convolution with an L 2 kernel, as above, is known as a Hilbert–Schmidt integral operator . Such operators are always compact . More generally, the Fredholm alternative is valid when K is any compact operator. The Fredholm alternative may be restated in the following form: a nonzero   λ   λ   \lambda   is either an eigenvalue of K , or it lies in the domain of the resolvent        R   (  λ  ;  K  )    =    (   K  -   λ  Id    )    -  1     .        R   λ  K     superscript    K    λ  Id      1      R(\lambda;K)=(K-\lambda\operatorname{Id})^{-1}.     Elliptic partial differential equations  The Fredholm alternative can be applied to solving linear elliptic boundary value problems . The basic result is: if the equation and the appropriate Banach spaces have been set up correctly, then either   (1) The homogeneous equation has a nontrivial solution, or    (2) The inhomogeneous equation can be solved uniquely for each choice of data.   The argument goes as follows. A typical simple-to-understand elliptic operator  L would be the Laplacian plus some lower order terms. Combined with suitable boundary conditions and expressed on a suitable Banach space X (which encodes both the boundary conditions and the desired regularity of the solution), L becomes an unbounded operator from X to itself, and one attempts to solve         L  u   =  f   ,   u  ∈   d  o  m   (  L  )    ⊆  X    ,     formulae-sequence      L  u   f       u    d  o  m  L        X      Lu=f,\qquad u\in dom(L)\subseteq X,     where f ∈ X is some function serving as data for which we want a solution. The Fredholm alternative, together with the theory of elliptic equations, will enable us to organize the solutions of this equation.  A concrete example would be an elliptic boundary-value problem like          (  *  )    L  u    :=    -   Δ  u    +   h   (  x  )   u    =  f    in  Ω    ,     formulae-sequence     assign      L  u          normal-Δ  u      h  x  u         f      in  normal-Ω     (*)\qquad Lu:=-\Delta u+h(x)u=f\qquad\text{in }\Omega,     supplemented with the boundary condition       (  *  *  )   u  =  0  on  ∂  Ω  ,     fragments   fragments  normal-(    normal-)   italic-  u   0  italic-  on   Ω  normal-,    (**)\qquad u=0\qquad\text{on }\partial\Omega,     where Ω ⊆ R n is a bounded open set with smooth boundary and h ( x ) is a fixed coefficient function (a potential, in the case of a Schrödinger operator). The function f ∈ X is the variable data for which we wish to solve the equation. Here one would take X to be the space L 2 (Ω) of all square-integrable functions on Ω, and dom ( L ) is then the Sobolev space  W  2,2 (Ω) ∩ W 0 1,2 (Ω), which amounts to the set of all square-integrable functions on Ω whose weak first and second derivatives exist and are square-integrable, and which satisfy a zero boundary condition on ∂Ω.  If X has been selected correctly (as it has in this example), then for μ 0 >> 0 the operator L + μ 0 is positive , and then employing elliptic estimates , one can prove that L + μ 0 : dom ( L ) → X is a bijection, and its inverse is a compact, everywhere-defined operator K from X to X , with image equal to dom ( L ). We fix one such μ 0 , but its value is not important as it is only a tool.  We may then transform the Fredholm alternative, stated above for compact operators, into a statement about the solvability of the boundary-value problem (*)-(**). The Fredholm alternative, as stated above, asserts:   For each λ ∈ R , either λ is an eigenvalue of K, or the operator K - λ is bijective from X to itself.   Let us explore the two alternatives as they play out for the boundary-value problem. Suppose λ ≠ 0. Then either  (A) λ is an eigenvalue of K ⇔ there is a solution h ∈ dom ( L ) of ( L + μ 0 ) h = λ -1 h ⇔ - μ 0 + λ -1 is an eigenvalue of L .  (B) The operator K - λ : X → X is a bijection ⇔ ( K - λ ) ( L + μ 0 ) = Id - λ ( L + μ 0 ) : dom ( L ) → X is a bijection ⇔ L + μ 0 - λ -1 : dom ( L ) → X is a bijection.  Replacing - μ 0 + λ -1 by λ , and treating the case λ = - μ 0 separately, this yields the following Fredholm alternative for an elliptic boundary-value problem:   For each λ ∈ R , either the homogeneous equation ( L - λ ) u = 0 has a nontrivial solution, or the inhomogeneous equation ( L - λ ) u = f possesses a unique solution u ∈ dom ( L ) for each given datum f ∈ X .   The latter function u solves the boundary-value problem (*)-(**) introduced above. This is the dichotomy that was claimed in (1)-(2) above. By the spectral theorem for compact operators, one also obtains that the set of λ for which the solvability fails is a discrete subset of R (the eigenvalues of L ). The eigenvalues can be thought of as "resonances" that block the solvability of the equation.  See also   Spectral theory of compact operators   References    A. G.
