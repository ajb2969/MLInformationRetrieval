   Pappus's centroid theorem      Pappus's centroid theorem   (Figure)  The theorem applied to an open cylinder, cone and a sphere to obtain their surface areas. The centroids are at a distance a (in red) from the axis of rotation.   In mathematics, Pappus' centroid theorem (also known as the Guldinus theorem , Pappus–Guldinus theorem or Pappus' theorem ) is either of two related theorems dealing with the surface areas and volumes of surfaces and solids of revolution.  The theorem is attributed to Pappus of Alexandria and Paul Guldin .  The first theorem  The first theorem states that the surface area  A of a surface of revolution generated by rotating a plane curve  C about an axis external to C and on the same plane is equal to the product of the arc length  s of C and the distance d traveled by its geometric centroid .       A  =   s  d    .      A    s  d     A=sd.\,     For example, the surface area of the torus with minor radius  r and major radius R is       A  =    (   2  π  r   )    (   2  π  R   )    =   4   π  2   R  r    .        A      2  π  r     2  π  R           4   superscript  π  2   R  r      A=(2\pi r)(2\pi R)=4\pi^{2}Rr.\,     The second theorem  The second theorem states that the volume  V of a solid of revolution generated by rotating a plane figure  F about an external axis is equal to the product of the area A of F and the distance d traveled by its geometric centroid.       V  =   A  d    .      V    A  d     V=Ad.\,     For example, the volume of the torus with minor radius r and major radius R is       V  =    (   π   r  2    )    (   2  π  R   )    =   2   π  2   R   r  2     .        V      π   superscript  r  2      2  π  R           2   superscript  π  2   R   superscript  r  2       V=(\pi r^{2})(2\pi R)=2\pi^{2}Rr^{2}.\,     Generalizations  The theorem can be generalized for arbitrary curves and shapes, under appropriate conditions. 1  References  External links     "  Category:Theorems in calculus  Category:Geometric centers  Category:Theorems in geometry  Category:Area  Category:Volume     ↩
