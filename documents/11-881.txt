   D-amino-acid N-acetyltransferase      D-amino-acid N-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a D-amino-acid N-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + a D-amino acid   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + an N-acetyl-D-amino acid   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and D-amino acid , whereas its two products are CoA and N-acetyl-D-amino acid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:D-amino-acid N-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include D-amino acid acetyltransferase , and D-amino acid-alpha-N-acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism .
