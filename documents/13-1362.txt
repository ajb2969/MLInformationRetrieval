   Metric k-center      Metric k-center   In graph theory , the metric k -center or metric facility location problem is a combinatorial optimization problem studied in theoretical computer science . Given n cities with specified distances, one wants to build k warehouses in different cities and minimize the maximum distance of a city to a warehouse. In graph theory this means finding a set of k vertices for which the largest distance of any point to its closest vertex in the k -set is minimum. The vertices must be in a metric space, or in other words a complete graph that satisfies the triangle inequality .  Formal definition  Given a complete undirected graph G = ( V , E ) with distances d ( v i , v j ) ∈ N satisfying the triangle inequality, find a subset S ⊆ V with | S | = k while minimizing:        max   v  ∈  V      min   s  ∈  S    d     (  v  ,  s  )         subscript     v  V      subscript     s  S    d     v  s     \max_{v\in V}\min_{s\in S}d(v,s)     Computational complexity  If we sort the edges in nondecreasing order of the distances: d ( e 1 ) ≤ d ( e 2 ) ≤ … ≤ d ( e m ) and let G i = ( V i , E i ), where E i = { e 1 , e 2 , …, e i }. The k -center problem is equivalent to finding the smallest index i such that G i has a dominating set of size at most k . 1 Although Dominating Set is NP-complete , the k -center problem remains NP-Hard . This is clear, since the optimality of a given feasible solution for the k -center problem can be determined through the Dominating Set reduction only if we know in first place the size of the optimal solution (i.e. the smallest index i such that G i has a dominating set of size at most k ) , which is precisely the difficult core of the NP-Hard problems.  Approximations  A simple greedy  approximation algorithm that achieves an approximation factor of 2 builds S using a farthest-first traversal in k iterations. The first iteration chooses an arbitrary vertex and adds it to S . Each subsequent iteration chooses a vertex v for which d (S, v) is maximized and adds v to S . The running time of the algorithm is O ( nk ). 2  Another algorithm with the same approximation factor takes advantage of the fact that the k -center problem is equivalent to finding the smallest index i such that G i has a dominating set of size at most k and computes a maximal independent set on the of G i , looking for the smallest index i that has a maximal independent set with a size of at least k . 3  It is not possible to find an approximation algorithm with an approximation factor of 2 − ε for any ε > 0, unless P = NP. 4 Furthermore, the distances of all edges in G must satisfy the triangle inequality if the k -center problem is to be approximated unless P = NP. 5  See also   Traveling salesman problem  Minimum k-cut  Dominating set  Independent set (graph theory)  Facility location problem   Notes    References          "  Category:NP-complete problems  Category:Combinatorial optimization  Category:Computational problems in graph theory  Category:Approximation algorithms     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
