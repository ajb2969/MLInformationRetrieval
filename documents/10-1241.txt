   2,5-dioxovalerate dehydrogenase      2,5-dioxovalerate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 2,5-dioxovalerate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2,5-dioxopentanoate + NADP + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxoglutarate + NADPH + 2 H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 2,5-dioxopentanoate , NADP + , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 2-oxoglutarate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,5-dioxopentanoate:NADP+ 5-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 2-oxoglutarate semialdehyde dehydrogenase , and alpha-ketoglutaric semialdehyde dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .
