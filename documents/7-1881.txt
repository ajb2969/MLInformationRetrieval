   Squared triangular number      Squared triangular number   (Figure)  Visual demonstration that the square of a triangular number equals a sum of cubes.   In number theory , the sum of the first   n   n   n    cubes is the square of the   n   n   n   th triangular number . That is,         1  3   +   2  3   +   3  3   +  ⋯  +   n  3    =    (   1  +  2  +  3  +  ⋯  +  n   )   2    .         superscript  1  3    superscript  2  3    superscript  3  3   normal-⋯   superscript  n  3     superscript    1  2  3  normal-⋯  n   2     1^{3}+2^{3}+3^{3}+\cdots+n^{3}=\left(1+2+3+\cdots+n\right)^{2}.   The same equation may be written more compactly using the mathematical notation for summation :         ∑   k  =  1   n    k  3    =    (    ∑   k  =  1   n   k   )   2    .        superscript   subscript     k  1    n    superscript  k  3     superscript    superscript   subscript     k  1    n   k   2     \sum_{k=1}^{n}k^{3}=\left(\sum_{k=1}^{n}k\right)^{2}.     This identity is sometimes called Nicomachus's theorem .  History  Many early mathematicians have studied and provided proofs of Nicomachus's theorem.  claims that "every student of number theory surely must have marveled at this miraculous fact".  finds references to the identity not only in the works of Nicomachus in what is now Jordan in the first century CE, but also in those of Aryabhata in India in the fifth century, and in those of Al-Karaji circa 1000 in Persia .  mentions several additional early mathematical works on this formula, by Alchabitius (tenth century Arabia), Gersonides (circa 1300 France), and Nilakantha Somayaji (circa 1500 India); he reproduces Nilakantha's visual proof.  Numeric values; geometric and probabilistic interpretation  The sequence of squared triangular numbers is        0  ,  1  ,  9  ,  36  ,  100  ,  225   ,     0  1  9  36  100  225    0,1,9,36,100,225,        441  ,  784  ,  1296  ,  2025  ,  3025  ,  4356  ,  6084  ,  8281   ,     441  784  1296  2025  3025  4356  6084  8281    441,784,1296,2025,3025,4356,6084,8281,   ... .   These numbers can be viewed as figurate numbers , a four-dimensional hyperpyramidal generalization of the triangular numbers and square pyramidal numbers .  As  observes, these numbers also count the number of rectangles with horizontal and vertical sides formed in an    n  ×  n      n  normal-×  n    n×n    grid . For instance, the points of a    4  ×  4      4  normal-×  4    4×4   grid (or a square made up of three smaller squares on a side) can form 36 different rectangles. The number of squares in a square grid is similarly counted by the square pyramidal numbers.  The identity also admits a natural probabilistic interpretation as follows. Let    X  ,  Y  ,  Z  ,  W     X  Y  Z  W    X,Y,Z,W   be four integer numbers independently and uniformly chosen at random between   1   1   1   and   n   n   n   . Then, the probability that   W   W   W   be the largest of the four numbers is equal to the probability that both   Y   Y   Y   is at least as large as   X   X   X   and   W   W   W   is at least as large as   Z   Z   Z   , that is, . Indeed, these probabilities are respectively the left and right sides of the Nichomacus identity, normalized to make probabilities by dividing both sides by .  Proofs  gives a particularly simple derivation, by expanding each cube in the sum into a set of consecutive odd numbers:        ∑   k  =  1   n     k  3       superscript   subscript     k  1    n    superscript  k  3     \displaystyle\sum_{k=1}^{n}k^{3}     The sum of any set of consecutive odd numbers starting from   1   1   1   is a square, and the quantity that is squared is the count of odd numbers in the sum. The latter is easily seen to be a count of the form    1  +  2  +  3  +  4  +  …  +  n      1  2  3  4  normal-…  n    1+2+3+4+...+n   .  thumb |240px |right |A square whose side length is a triangular number can be partitioned into squares and half-squares whose areas add to cubes. From . In the more recent mathematical literature,  uses the rectangle-counting interpretation of these numbers to form a geometric proof of the identity (see also ); he observes that it may also be proved easily (but uninformatively) by induction, and states that  provides "an interesting old Arabic proof".  provides a purely visual proof,  provide two additional proofs, and  gives seven geometric proofs.  Generalizations  A similar result to Nicomachus's theorem holds for all power sums , namely that odd power sums (sums of odd powers) are a polynomial in triangular numbers. These are called Faulhaber polynomials , of which the sum of cubes is the simplest and most elegant example.  studies more general conditions under which the sum of a consecutive sequence of cubes forms a square.  and  study polynomial analogues of the square triangular number formula, in which series of polynomials add to the square of another polynomial.
