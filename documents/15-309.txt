   Fischer group Fi24      Fischer group Fi24     In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Fischer group  Fi 24 or F 24 ′ is a sporadic simple group of order   2 21 {{·}}3 16 {{·}}5 2 {{·}}7 3 {{·}}11{{·}}13{{·}}17{{·}}23{{·}}29  = 1255205709190661721292800  ≈ 1     ×    10  2   4       absent     superscript  10  2   4     \times 10^{2}4   .   History and properties  Fi 24 is one of the 26 sporadic groups and is the largest of the three Fischer groups introduced by  while investigating 3-transposition groups . It is the 3rd largest of the sporadic groups (after the Monster group and Baby Monster group).  The outer automorphism group has order 2, and the Schur multiplier has order 3. The automorphism group is a 3-transposition group Fi 24 , containing the simple group with index 2.  The centralizer of an element of order 3 in the monster group is a triple cover of the automorphism group Fi 24 , as a result of which the prime 3 plays a special role in its theory.  Representations  The centralizer of an element of order 3 in the monster group is a triple cover of the Fischer group, as a result of which the prime 3 plays a special role in its theory. In particular it acts on a vertex operator algebra over the field with 3 elements.  The simple Fischer group has a rank 3 action on a graph of 306936 (=2 3 .3 3 .7 2 .29) vertices corresponding to the 3-transpositions of Fi 24 , with point stabilizer the Fischer group Fi23 .  The triple cover has a complex representation of dimension 783. When reduced modulo 3 this has 1-dimensional invariant subspaces and quotient spaces, giving an irreducible representation of dimension 781 over the field with 3 elements.  Generalized Monstrous Moonshine  Conway and Norton suggested in their 1979 paper that monstrous moonshine is not limited to the monster, but that similar phenomena may be found for other groups. Larissa Queen and others subsequently found that one can construct the expansions of many Hauptmoduln from simple combinations of dimensions of sporadic groups. For Fi 24 (as well as Fi 23 ), the relevant McKay-Thompson series is     T   3  A     (  τ  )        subscript  T    3  A    τ    T_{3A}(\tau)   where one can set the constant term a(0) = 42 (),       j   3  A     (  τ  )        subscript  j    3  A    τ    \displaystyle j_{3A}(\tau)     Maximal subgroups  found the 22 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of Fi 24 as follows:   Fi 23 Centralizes a 3-transposition in the automorphism group Fi 24 .  2.Fi 22 :2  (3 x O(3):3):2  O(2)  3 7 .O 7 (3)  3 1+10 :U 5 (2):2  2 11 .M 24  2 2 .U 6 (2):S 3  2 1+12 :3.U 4 (3).2  3 2+4+8 .(A 5 x 2A 4 ).2  (A 4 x O(2):3):2  He:2 (Two classes, fused by an outer automorphism)  2 3+12 .(L 3 (2) x A 6 )  2 6+8 .(S 3 x A 8 )  (G 2 (3) x 3 2 :2).2  (A 9 x A 5 ):2  A 7 x 7:6  [3 13 ]:(L 3 (3) x 2)  L 2 (8):3 x A 6  U 3 (3):2 (Two classes, fused by an outer automorphism)  L 2 (13):2 (Two classes, fused by an outer automorphism)  29:14   References    contains a complete proof of Fischer's theorem.
