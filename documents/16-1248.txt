Ricci soliton

In differential geometry, a Ricci soliton is a special type of Riemannian metric. Such metrics evolve under Ricci flow only by symmetries of the flow, and they can be viewed as generalizations of Einstein metrics.1 The concept is named after Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro.
Ricci flow solutions are invariant under diffeomorphisms and scaling, so one is led to consider solutions that evolve exactly in these ways. A metric 
 
 
 
  on a smooth manifold 
 
 
 
  is a Ricci soliton if there exists a function 
 
 
 
  and a family of diffeomorphisms 
 
 
 
  such that



is a solution of Ricci flow. In this expression, 
 
 
 
  refers to the pullback off the metric 
 
 
 
  by the diffeomorphism 
 
 
 
 .
Equivalently, a metric 
 
 
 
  is a Ricci soliton if and only if



where 
 
 
 
  is the Ricci curvature tensor, 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a vector field on 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  represents the Lie derivative. This condition is a generalization of the Einstein condition for metrics:
