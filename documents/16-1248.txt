   Ricci soliton      Ricci soliton   In differential geometry , a Ricci soliton is a special type of Riemannian  metric . Such metrics evolve under Ricci flow only by symmetries of the flow, and they can be viewed as generalizations of Einstein metrics. 1 The concept is named after Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro .  Ricci flow solutions are invariant under diffeomorphisms and scaling, so one is led to consider solutions that evolve exactly in these ways. A metric    g  0     subscript  g  0    g_{0}   on a smooth manifold   M   M   M   is a Ricci soliton if there exists a function    σ   (  t  )       σ  t    \sigma(t)   and a family of diffeomorphisms     {   η   (  t  )    }   ⊂   Diff   (  M  )           η  t     Diff  M     \{\eta(t)\}\subset\operatorname{Diff}(M)   such that       g   (  t  )    =   σ   (  t  )   η    (  t  )   *    g  0          g  t     σ  t  η   superscript  t     subscript  g  0      g(t)=\sigma(t)\,\eta(t)^{*}g_{0}     is a solution of Ricci flow. In this expression,    η    (  t  )   *    g  0       η   superscript  t     subscript  g  0     \eta(t)^{*}g_{0}   refers to the pullback off the metric    g  0     subscript  g  0    g_{0}   by the diffeomorphism    η   (  t  )       η  t    \eta(t)   .  Equivalently, a metric    g  0     subscript  g  0    g_{0}   is a Ricci soliton if and only if        Rc   (   g  0   )    =     λ    g  0    +    ℒ  X    g  0      ,       Rc   subscript  g  0        λ   subscript  g  0       subscript  ℒ  X    subscript  g  0       \operatorname{Rc}(g_{0})=\lambda\,g_{0}+\mathcal{L}_{X}g_{0},     where   Rc   Rc   \operatorname{Rc}   is the Ricci curvature tensor,    λ  ∈  ℝ      λ  ℝ    \lambda\in\mathbb{R}   ,   X   X   X   is a vector field on   M   M   M   , and   ℒ   ℒ   \mathcal{L}   represents the Lie derivative . This condition is a generalization of the Einstein condition for metrics:        Rc   (   g  0   )    =    λ    g  0     .       Rc   subscript  g  0      λ   subscript  g  0      \operatorname{Rc}(g_{0})=\lambda\,g_{0}.     References     "  Category:Riemannian geometry     ↩
