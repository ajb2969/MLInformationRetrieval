   Saturation (graph theory)      Saturation (graph theory)   Let    G   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G(V,E)   be a graph and   M   M   M   a matching in   G   G   G   . A vertex    v  ∈   V   (  G  )        v    V  G     v\in V(G)   is said to be saturated by   M   M   M   if there is an edge in   M   M   M   incident to   v   v   v   . A vertex    v  ∈   V   (  G  )        v    V  G     v\in V(G)   with no such edge is said to be unsaturated by   M   M   M   . We also say that   M   M   M    saturates    v   v   v   . 1  See also   Hall's marriage theorem  Bipartite matching   References  "  Category:Matching     [ http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from; ;=objects&id;=4735 Saturate].
