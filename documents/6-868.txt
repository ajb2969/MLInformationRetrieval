Saturation (graph theory)

Let 
 
 
 
  be a graph and 
 
 
 
  a matching in 
 
 
 
 . A vertex 
 
 
 
 
  is said to be saturated by 
 
 
 
  if there is an edge in 
 
 
 
  incident to 
 
 
 
 . A vertex 
 
 
 
  with no such edge is said to be unsaturated by 
 
 
 
 
 . We also say that 
 
 
saturates
