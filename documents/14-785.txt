   Double Chooz      Double Chooz    Double Chooz ( DC ) is a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment in Chooz , France. Its goal is to measure or set a limit on the θ 13 mixing angle, a neutrino oscillation parameter responsible for changing electron neutrinos into other neutrinos. The experiment uses reactors of the Chooz Nuclear Power Plant as a neutrino source and measures the flux of neutrinos they receive. To accomplish this, Double Chooz has a set of two detectors situated 400 meters and 1050 meters from the reactors. Double Chooz is a successor to the CHOOZ experiment; one of its detectors occupies the same site as its predecessor. Until recently all data has been collected using only the far detector; however, the near detector was completed in September 2014, after construction delays. 1  Detector design  Double Chooz uses two identical gadolinium detectors placed around the 4.25 GW thermal power reactors to measure antineutrino disappearance. The two detectors are aptly referred to as "near," 400 meters from the reactor; and "far," 1,050 meters from the reactor. The far detector is placed inside a hill such that there is a 300 meters of water equivalent of shielding from cosmic muons. The detector itself is a calorimetric liquid scintillator consisting of four concentric cylindrical vessels. 2 3  Neutrino target and γ-catcher  The innermost vessel is made with acrylic plastic material and has a diameter of 230 cm, a height of 245.8 cm, and a thickness of 0.8 cm. This chamber is filled with 10,000 liters of Gadolinium (Gd) loaded (1 gram/liter) liquid scintillator; it is the neutrino target. The next layer out is the γ-catcher. It surrounds the neutrino target with a 55 cm thick layer of Gd-free liquid scintillator. The casing for the γ-catcher is 12 cm thick and made of the same material as the neutrino catcher. Due to the materiel's composition, both of these vessels are transparent to photons with a wavelength greater than 400 nm. 4  5  Buffer vessel and PMTs  The buffer vessel is made of stainless steel 304L with dimensions of 552.2 cm wide by 568.0 cm tall and 0.3 cm thick. The remainder of the interior space that isn't occupied by the acrylic double vessel is filled with a non-scintillating mineral oil. On the inner surface of the buffer vessel are 390 10-inch photomultiplier tubes . The purpose of the buffer layer is to shield from radioactivity in the PMTs and the surrounding rock. These to layers in addition to the neutrino target and γ-catcher are collectively referred to as the "inner detector." 6  7  Inner and outer vetos  The inner veto surrounds the buffer vessel with a 50 cm thick layer of scintillating mineral oil. In addition, it has 78 8-inch PMTs distributed on the top, bottom and sides. This inner veto layer serves as an active veto layer for muons and fast neutrons. The surrounding 15 cm thick steel casing further serves to shield against external γ-rays. The outer veto covers the top of the detector tank. It consists of strips with a 5 cm x 1 cm cross section laid in orthogonal directions. 8  9  Data collection  Signals from the inner detector and the inner veto are recorded by 8-bit flash ADC electronics with a sampling rate of 500 MHz. The trigger threshold for the detectors is set to 350 keV, much lower than the 1.02 MeV expected of the electron anti-neutrinos. 10 11  For several years DC has operated with only the far detector and has used models such as Bugey4 to calculate the expected flux. The completed near detector will allow increased precision in the next years of data taking.  Experimental Techniques  Neutrino Mixing  Neutrinos are electrically neutral, extremely light particles that only interact weakly, meaning they can travel vast distances without ever being noticed. One of the properties of neutrinos is that as the propagate they have a chance to oscillate from one flavor (    e  ,  μ  ,  τ     e  μ  τ    e,\mu,\tau   ) to another, and this is the principle under which the experiment operates. The goal of Double Chooz is to more tightly constrain the value for the    θ  13     subscript  θ  13    \theta_{13}   mixing angle.  The Chooz experiment found that the    θ  13     subscript  θ  13    \theta_{13}    mixing angle is constrained to the following        sin  2    (   2   θ  13    )    <  0.2        superscript   2     2   subscript  θ  13     0.2    \sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})<0.2     The goal of the Double Chooz experiment is to continue to explore the    θ  13     subscript  θ  13    \theta_{13}   angle by probing an even smaller region      0.03  <    sin  2    (   2   θ  13    )    <  0.2        0.03    superscript   2     2   subscript  θ  13          0.2     0.03<\sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})<0.2     Observations of the mixing angle are accomplished by observing the     ν  e   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  ν  e     \bar{\nu_{e}}   flux that comes off of the reactors during their fission reactions . The expected     ν  e   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  ν  e     \bar{\nu_{e}}   flux from the reactors is about 50 per day. Due to the one of the neutrino mass-squared difference being much smaller than the other, the Double Chooz experiment only needs to consider a two-flavor oscillation . In the two-flavor model the survival probability of any given neutrino is modeled by       P  =   1  -     sin  2    (   2   θ  13    )      sin  2    (    1.27  Δ   m  31  2   L    E  ν    )     (    natural   units   )      .      P    1      superscript   2     2   subscript  θ  13       superscript   2       1.27  normal-Δ   subscript   superscript  m  2   31   L    subscript  E  ν       natural  units       P=1-\sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})\,\sin^{2}\left(\frac{1.27\Delta m^{2}_{31}L}{E_{\nu%
 }}\right)\,\mathrm{(natural\,units)}.     Here   L   L   L   is the length in meters the neutrino has traveled and    E  ν     subscript  E  ν    E_{\nu}   is the energy of the     ν  e   ¯     normal-¯   subscript  ν  e     \bar{\nu_{e}}   particle. From this the value of the mixing angle can be measured from the oscillation amplitude in reactor neutrino oscillations. 12  Observations  The neutrinos from the reactor are observed via the inverse beta decay (IBD) process          ν  ¯   e   +  p   →    e  +   +  n    .     normal-→     subscript   normal-¯  ν   e   p      superscript  e    n     \bar{\nu}_{e}+p\to e^{+}+n.    13  Since there are backgrounds to consider, candidates for (IBD) are determined by the following: visible energy from the prompt signal must be between 0.5 and 20 MeV; the delayed signal must have an energy between 4 and 10 MeV; the time difference between those two signals must be between 0.5 and 150 microseconds; the distance between the vertices of the two signals should be less than 100 cm; and no other signals (except for the delayed signal) are found 200 microseconds before or 600 microseconds after the prompt signal. Detection of the prompt signal has reached nearly 100% efficiency, however it is not as easy to detect the delayed signal due to issues such as Gd-concentration and neutron scattering models. 14  Results  Mixing angle  In November 2011, first results of the experiment were presented at the LowNu conference in Seoul , hinting at a non-zero value of θ 13 . 15 In a 2012 article using 228 days of data,    θ  13     subscript  θ  13    \theta_{13}   was measured and the no oscillation hypothesis was excluded. 16  Neutron capture on hydrogen was used to produce independent data, which was analysed to yield a separate measurement in 2013: 17         sin  2    (   2   θ  13    )    =   0.097  ±    0.034    (  stat  )    ±    0.034    (  syst  )      .        superscript   2     2   subscript  θ  13      plus-or-minus  0.097    0.034  stat     0.034  syst      \sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})=0.097\pm 0.034\,\mathrm{(stat)}\pm 0.034\,\mathrm{(syst%
 )}.     Using reactor-off data, a background-independent measurement 18 was published July 2014 in Physics Letters B:         sin  2    (   2   θ  13    )    =   0.102  ±    0.028    (  stat  )    ±    0.033    (  syst  )      .        superscript   2     2   subscript  θ  13      plus-or-minus  0.102    0.028  stat     0.033  syst      \sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})=0.102\pm 0.028\,\mathrm{(stat)}\pm 0.033\,\mathrm{(syst%
 )}.     An improved measurement with reduced background and systematic uncertainties after 467.90 days of data was published in JHEP in 2014: 19         sin  2    (   2   θ  13    )    =   0.090   -  0.029    +  0.032     .        superscript   2     2   subscript  θ  13      subscript   superscript  0.090    0.032      0.029      \sin^{2}(2\theta_{13})=0.090^{+0.032}_{-0.029}.     Other Results  DC was able to identify positronium formation in their detector, which delays positron annihilation and distorts the scintillation signal. 20 A tagging algorithm was developed that could be used in neutrino detectors for improved background rejection, which was similarly done by Borexino for cosmogenic 11 C background. An ortho-positronium lifetime of 3.68ns ± 0.15 ns was measured, compatible with other dedicated setups.  Limits on Lorentz violation parameters were also set. 21  Bibliography       References  External links   Project Homepage   "  Category:Neutrino experiments  Category:Reactor neutrino experiments     ↩  http://arxiv.org/pdf/hep-ex/0606025v4.pdf ↩  http://arxiv.org/pdf/1406.7763v4.pdf ↩             Herve de Kerret, "First results from the Double Chooz experiment" , talk at the LowNu conference, Seoul, November 2011, via: http://www.doublechooz.org/Status_and_News/status_and_news.php ↩  ↩  ↩  Phys.Lett.
