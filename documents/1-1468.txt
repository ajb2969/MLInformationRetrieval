Isomorphism theorem

In mathematics, specifically abstract algebra, the isomorphism theorems are three theorems that describe the relationship between quotients, homomorphisms, and subobjects. Versions of the theorems exist for groups, rings, vector spaces, modules, Lie algebras, and various other algebraic structures. In universal algebra, the isomorphism theorems can be generalized to the context of algebras and congruences.
History
The isomorphism theorems were formulated in some generality for homomorphisms of modules by Emmy Noether in her paper Abstrakter Aufbau der Idealtheorie in algebraischen Zahl- und Funktionenkörpern which was published in 1927 in Mathematische Annalen. Less general versions of these theorems can be found in work of Richard Dedekind and previous papers by Noether.
Three years later, B.L. van der Waerden published his influential Algebra, the first abstract algebra textbook that took the groups-rings-fields approach to the subject. Van der Waerden credited lectures by Noether on group theory and Emil Artin on algebra, as well as a seminar conducted by Artin, Wilhelm Blaschke, Otto Schreier, and van der Waerden himself on ideals as the main references. The three isomorphism theorems, called homomorphism theorem, and two laws of isomorphism when applied to groups, appear explicitly.
Groups
We first state the three isomorphism theorems in the context of groups. Note that some sources switch the numbering of the second and third theorems.1 Another variation encountered in the literature, particularly in Van der Waerden's Algebra, is to call first isomorphism theorem the Fundamental Homomorphism Theorem and consequently to decrement the numbering of the remaining isomorphism theorems by one.2 Finally, in the most extensive numbering scheme, the lattice theorem (also known as the correspondence theorem) is sometimes referred to as the fourth isomorphism theorem.
Statement of the theorems
First isomorphism theorem
Let G and H be groups, and let φ: G → H be a homomorphism. Then:

The kernel of φ is a normal subgroup of G,
The image of φ is a subgroup of H, and
The image of φ is isomorphic to the quotient group G / ker(φ).

In particular, if φ is surjective then H is isomorphic to G / ker(φ).
Second isomorphism theorem
Let G be a group. Let S be a subgroup of G, and let N be a normal subgroup of G. Then:

The product SN is a subgroup of G,
The intersection S ∩ N is a normal subgroup of S, and
The quotient groups (SN) / N and S / (S ∩ N) are isomorphic.

Technically, it is not necessary for N to be a normal subgroup, as long as S is a subgroup of the normalizer of N. In this case, the intersection S ∩ N is not a normal subgroup of G, but it is still a normal subgroup of S.
This isomorphism theorem has been called the "diamond theorem" due to the shape of the resulting subgroup lattice with SN at the top, S ∩ N at the bottom and with N and S to the sides.3 It has even been called the "parallelogram rule" (by analogy with the parallelogram rule for vectors) because in the resulting subgroup lattice the two sides assumed to represent the quotient groups (SN) / N and S / (S ∩ N) are "equal" in the sense of isomorphism.4
Third isomorphism theorem
Let G be a group, and N a normal subgroup of G. Then

If 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
Every subgroup of 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
 , for some subgroup 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
 .
Every normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
 , for some normal subgroup 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a normal subgroup of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then the quotient group 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .

W.R. Scott calls it the "Freshman theorem" because the result simply follows by "cancellation" of N.5
Discussion




First isomorphism theorem

The first isomorphism theorem follows from the category theoretical fact that the category of groups is (normal epi, mono)-factorizable; in other words, the normal epimorphisms and the monomorphisms form a factorization system for the category. This is captured in the commutative diagram in the margin, which shows the objects and morphisms whose existence can be deduced from the morphism f: G→H. The diagram shows that every morphism in the category of groups has a kernel in the category theoretical sense; the arbitrary morphism f factors into 
 
 
 
 , where ι is a monomorphism and π is an epimorphism (in a conormal category, all epimorphisms are normal). This is represented in the diagram by an object 
 
 
 
  and a monomorphism 
 
 
 
  (kernels are always monomorphisms), which complete the short exact sequence running from the lower left to the upper right of the diagram. The use of the exact sequence convention saves us from having to draw the zero morphisms from 
 
 
 
  to H and 
 
 
 
 .
If the sequence is right split (i. e., there is a morphism σ that maps 
 
 
 
  to a π-preimage of itself), then G is the semidirect product of the normal subgroup 
 
 
 
  and the subgroup 
 
 
 
 . If it is left split (i. e., there exists some 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 ), then it must also be right split, and 
 
 
 
  is a direct product decomposition of G. In general, the existence of a right split does not imply the existence of a left split; but in an abelian category (such as the abelian groups), left splits and right splits are equivalent by the splitting lemma, and a right split is sufficient to produce a direct sum decomposition 
 
 
 
 . In an abelian category, all monomorphisms are also normal, and the diagram may be extended by a second short exact sequence 
 
 
 
 .
In the second isomorphism theorem, the product SN is the join of S and N in the lattice of subgroups of G, while the intersection S ∩ N is the meet.
The third isomorphism theorem is generalized by the nine lemma to abelian categories and more general maps between objects.
Rings
The statements of the theorems for rings are similar, with the notion of a normal subgroup replaced by the notion of an ideal.
First isomorphism theorem
Let R and S be rings, and let φ: R → S be a ring homomorphism. Then:

The kernel of φ is an ideal of R,
The image of φ is a subring of S, and
The image of φ is isomorphic to the quotient ring R / ker(φ).

In particular, if φ is surjective then S is isomorphic to R / ker(φ).
Second isomorphism theorem
Let R be a ring. Let S be a subring of R, and let I be an ideal of R. Then:

The sum S + I = {s + i | s ∈ S, i ∈ I} is a subring of R,
The intersection S ∩ I is an ideal of S, and
The quotient rings (S + I) / I and S / (S ∩ I) are isomorphic.

Third isomorphism theorem
Let R be a ring, and B an ideal of R. Then

If 
 
 
 
  is a subring of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a subring of 
 
 
 
 .
Every subring of 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
 , for some subring 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is an ideal of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is an ideal of 
 
 
 
 .
Every ideal of 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
 , for some ideal 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is an ideal of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then the quotient ring 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .

Modules
The statements of the isomorphism theorems for modules are particularly simple, since it is possible to form a quotient module from any submodule. The isomorphism theorems for vector spaces and abelian groups are special cases of these. For finite-dimensional vector spaces, all of these theorems follow from the rank-nullity theorem.
For all of the following theorems, the word “module” will mean “R-module”, where R is some fixed ring.
First isomorphism theorem
Let M and N be modules, and let φ: M → N be a module homomorphism. Then:

The kernel of φ is a submodule of M,
The image of φ is a submodule of N, and
The image of φ is isomorphic to the quotient module M / ker(φ).

In particular, if φ is surjective then N is isomorphic to M / ker(φ).
Second isomorphism theorem
Let M be a module, and let S and T be submodules of M. Then:

The sum S + T = {s + t | s ∈ S, t ∈ T} is a submodule of M,
The intersection S ∩ T is a submodule of M, and
The quotient modules (S + T) / T and S / (S ∩ T) are isomorphic.

Third isomorphism theorem
Let M be a module, T a submodule of M.

If 
 
 
 
  is a submodule of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is a submodule of 
 
 
 
 .
Every submodule of 
 
 
 
  is of the form 
 
 
 
 , for some submodule 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a submodule of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then the quotient module 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .

General
To generalise this to universal algebra, normal subgroups need to be replaced by congruences.
A congruence on an algebra

 
  is an equivalence relation 
 
 
 
  which is a subalgebra of 
 
 
 
  endowed with the component-wise operation structure. One can make the set of equivalence classes 
 
 
 
  into an algebra of the same type by defining the operations via representatives; this will be well-defined since 
 
 
 
  is a subalgebra of 
 
 
 
 . The resulting structure is the quotient algebra.
First Isomorphism Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be an algebra homomorphism. Then the image of 
 
 
 
  is a subalgebra of 
 
 
 
 , the relation given by 
 
 
 
  (i.e. the kernel of f) is a congruence on 
 
 
 
 , and the algebras 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are isomorphic. (Note that in the case of a group, f(x)=f(y) iff f(xy-1) = 1, so one recovers the notion of kernel used in group theory in this case.)
Second Isomorphism Theorem
Given an algebra 
 
 
 
 , a subalgebra 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , and a congruence 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the trace of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the collection of equivalence classes that intersect 
 
 
 
 .
Then (i) 
 
 
 
  is a congruence on 
 
 
 
 , (ii) 
 
 
 
  is a subalgebra of 
 
 
 
 , and (iii) the algebra 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the algebra 
 
 
 
 .
Third Isomorphism Theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be an algebra and 
 
 
 
  two congruence relations on 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a congruence on 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .
