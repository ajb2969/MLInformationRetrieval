   Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge problems      Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge problems  The '''Hundred-dollar, Hundred-digit Challenge problems''' are 10 problems in [[numerical mathematics]] pub lished in 2002 by . A $100 prize was offered to whoever produced the most accurate solutions, measured up to 10 significant digits . The deadline for the contest was May 20, 2002. In the end, 20 teams solved all of the problems perfectly within the required precision, and an anonymous donor aided in producing the required prize monies. The challenge and its solutions were described in detail in the book .
