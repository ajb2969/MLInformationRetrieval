   Gaussian curvature      Gaussian curvature   (Figure)  From left to right: a surface of negative Gaussian curvature ( hyperboloid ), a surface of zero Gaussian curvature ( cylinder ), and a surface of positive Gaussian curvature ( sphere ).   In differential geometry , the Gaussian curvature or Gauss curvature of a surface at a point is the product of the principal curvatures , κ 1 and κ 2 , at the given point. It is an intrinsic measure of curvature, depending only on distances that are measured on the surface, not on the way it is isometrically embedded in any space. It is named after Carl Friedrich Gauss , and is the content of his Theorema egregium .  Symbolically, the Gaussian curvature  Κ is defined as        \Kappa   =    κ  1    κ  2     ,      \Kappa     subscript  κ  1    subscript  κ  2      \Kappa=\kappa_{1}\kappa_{2},   where κ 1 and κ 2 are the principal curvatures .  Informal definition  (Figure)  Saddle surface with normal planes in directions of principal curvatures   At any point on a surface we can find a normal vector which is at right angles to the surface; planes containing the normal are called normal planes . The intersection of a normal plane and the surface will form a curve called a normal section and the curvature of this curve is the normal curvature . For most points on most surfaces, different sections will have different curvatures; the maximum and minimum values of these are called the principal curvatures , call these κ 1 , κ 2 . The Gaussian curvature is the product of the two principal curvatures Κ = κ 1 κ 2 .  The sign of the Gaussian curvature can be used to characterise the surface.   If both principal curvatures are the same sign: κ 1 κ 2 > 0, then the Gaussian curvature is positive and the surface is said to have an elliptic point. At such points the surface will be dome like, locally lying on one side of its tangent plane. All sectional curvatures will have the same sign.  If the principal curvatures have different signs: κ 1 κ 2 < 0, then the Gaussian curvature is negative and the surface is said to have a hyperbolic point. At such points the surface will be saddle shaped. For two directions the sectional curvatures will be zero giving the asymptotic directions .  If one of the principal curvatures is zero: κ 1 κ 2 = 0, the Gaussian curvature is zero and the surface is said to have a parabolic point.   Most surfaces will contain regions of positive Gaussian curvature (elliptical points) and regions of negative Gaussian curvature separated by a curve of points with zero Gaussian curvature called a parabolic line .  Further informal discussion  In differential geometry , the two principal curvatures at a given point of a surface are the eigenvalues of the shape operator at the point. They measure how the surface bends by different amounts in different directions at that point. We represent the surface by the implicit function theorem as the graph of a function, f , of two variables, in such a way that the point p is a critical point, i.e., the gradient of f vanishes (this can always be attained by a suitable rigid motion). Then the Gaussian curvature of the surface at p is the determinant of the Hessian matrix of f (being the product of the eigenvalues of the Hessian). (Recall that the Hessian is the 2-by-2 matrix of second derivatives.) This definition allows one immediately to grasp the distinction between cup/cap versus saddle point.  Alternative definitions  It is also given by        \Kappa   =    ⟨    (     ∇  2    ∇  1    -    ∇  1    ∇  2     )    𝐞  1    ,   𝐞  2   ⟩    det  g     ,      \Kappa           subscript  normal-∇  2    subscript  normal-∇  1      subscript  normal-∇  1    subscript  normal-∇  2      subscript  𝐞  1     subscript  𝐞  2      g      \Kappa=\frac{\langle(\nabla_{2}\nabla_{1}-\nabla_{1}\nabla_{2})\mathbf{e}_{1},%
 \mathbf{e}_{2}\rangle}{\det g},   where     ∇  i   =   ∇   𝐞  i         subscript  normal-∇  i    subscript  normal-∇   subscript  𝐞  i      \nabla_{i}=\nabla_{{\mathbf{e}}_{i}}   is the covariant derivative and g is the metric tensor .  At a point p on a regular surface in R 3 , the Gaussian curvature is also given by        K   (  𝐩  )    =   det   (   S   (  𝐩  )    )     ,        K  𝐩       S  𝐩      K(\mathbf{p})=\det(S(\mathbf{p})),   where S is the shape operator .  A useful formula for the Gaussian curvature is Liouville's equation in terms of the Laplacian in isothermal coordinates .  Total curvature  (Figure)  The sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of negative curvature is less than that of a plane triangle.   The surface integral of the Gaussian curvature over some region of a surface is called the total curvature . The total curvature of a geodesic  triangle equals the deviation of the sum of its angles from π. The sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of positive curvature will exceed π, while the sum of the angles of a triangle on a surface of negative curvature will be less than π. On a surface of zero curvature, such as the Euclidean plane , the angles will sum to precisely π radians.         ∑   i  =  1   3    θ  i    =   π  +    ∬  T     K   d  A      .        superscript   subscript     i  1    3    subscript  θ  i      π    subscript  double-integral  T     K  d  A       \sum_{i=1}^{3}\theta_{i}=\pi+\iint_{T}K\,dA.     A more general result is the Gauss–Bonnet theorem .  Important theorems  Theorema egregium  Gauss's Theorema Egregium (Latin: "remarkable theorem") states that Gaussian curvature of a surface can be determined from the measurements of length on the surface itself. In fact, it can be found given the full knowledge of the first fundamental form and expressed via the first fundamental form and its partial derivatives of first and second order. Equivalently, the determinant of the second fundamental form of a surface in R 3 can be so expressed. The "remarkable", and surprising, feature of this theorem is that although the definition of the Gaussian curvature of a surface S in R 3 certainly depends on the way in which the surface is located in space, the end result, the Gaussian curvature itself, is determined by the intrinsic metric of the surface without any further reference to the ambient space: it is an intrinsic  invariant . In particular, the Gaussian curvature is invariant under isometric deformations of the surface.  In contemporary differential geometry , a "surface", viewed abstractly, is a two-dimensional differentiable manifold . To connect this point of view with the classical theory of surfaces , such an abstract surface is embedded into R 3 and endowed with the Riemannian metric given by the first fundamental form. Suppose that the image of the embedding is a surface S in R 3 . A local isometry is a diffeomorphism  f : U → V between open regions of R 3 whose restriction to S ∩ U is an isometry onto its image. Theorema Egregium is then stated as follows:   The Gaussian curvature of an embedded smooth surface in R 3 is invariant under the local isometries.   For example, the Gaussian curvature of a cylindrical tube is zero, the same as for the "unrolled" tube (which is flat). 1 On the other hand, since a sphere of radius R has constant positive curvature R −2 and a flat plane has constant curvature 0, these two surfaces are not isometric, even locally. Thus any planar representation of even a part of a sphere must distort the distances. Therefore, no cartographic projection is perfect.  Gauss–Bonnet theorem  The Gauss–Bonnet theorem links the total curvature of a surface to its Euler characteristic and provides an important link between local geometric properties and global topological properties.  Surfaces of constant curvature   Minding 's theorem (1839) states that all surfaces with the same constant curvature K are locally isometric . A consequence of Minding's theorem is that any surface whose curvature is identically zero can be constructed by bending some plane region. Such surfaces are called developable surfaces . Minding also raised the question whether a closed surface with constant positive curvature is necessarily rigid.    Liebmann's theorem (1900) answered Minding's question. The only regular (of class C 2 ) closed surfaces in R 3 with constant positive Gaussian curvature are spheres . 2 A standard proof uses Hilbert's lemma that points of extreme principal curvature have non-positive Gaussian curvature. 3    Hilbert's theorem (1901) states that there exists no complete analytic (class C ω ) regular surface in R 3 of constant negative Gaussian curvature. In fact, the conclusion also holds for surfaces of class C 2 immersed in R 3 , but breaks down for C 1 -surfaces. The pseudosphere has constant negative Gaussian curvature except at its singular cusp . 4   Alternative formulas   Gaussian curvature of a surface in R 3 can be expressed as the ratio of the determinants of the second and first fundamental forms:          K  =    det   I  I     det  I    =     L  N   -   M  2      E  G   -   F  2      .

The Brioschi formula gives Gaussian curvature solely in terms of the first fundamental form:         K  =     det   |        -     1  2     E   v  v      +   F   u  v     -     1  2     G   u  u           1  2     E  u        F  u   -     1  2     E  v           F  v   -     1  2     G  u       E    F         1  2     G  v      F    G     |    -   det   |     0       1  2     E  v         1  2     G  u           1  2     E  v      E    F         1  2     G  u      F    G     |       (    E  G   -   F  2    )   2        K                      1  2    subscript  E    v  v       subscript  F    u  v         1  2    subscript  G    u  u          1  2    subscript  E  u       subscript  F  u       1  2    subscript  E  v          subscript  F  v       1  2    subscript  G  u     E  F        1  2    subscript  G  v    F  G            0      1  2    subscript  E  v        1  2    subscript  G  u          1  2    subscript  E  v    E  F        1  2    subscript  G  u    F  G        superscript      E  G    superscript  F  2    2      K=\frac{\det\begin{vmatrix}-\frac{1}{2}E_{vv}+F_{uv}-\frac{1}{2}G_{uu}&\frac{1%
