   Two-body problem      Two-body problem   In classical mechanics , the two-body problem is to determine the motion of two point particles that interact only with each other. Common examples include a satellite orbiting a planet , a planet orbiting a star , two stars orbiting each other (a binary star ), and a classical electron orbiting an atomic nucleus (although to solve the electron/nucleus 2-body system correctly a quantum mechanical approach must be used).  The two-body problem can be re-formulated as two one-body problems , a trivial one and one that involves solving for the motion of one particle in an external potential . Since many one-body problems can be solved exactly, the corresponding two-body problem can also be solved. By contrast, the three-body problem (and, more generally, the n -body problem for n ≥ 3) cannot be solved in terms of first integrals, except in special cases.

The goal is to determine the trajectories x 1 ( t ) and x 2 ( t ) for all times t , given the initial positions x 1 ( t = 0) and x 2 ( t = 0) and the initial velocities v 1 ( t = 0) and v 2 ( t = 0).  When applied to the two masses, Newton's second law states that        𝐅  12    (   𝐱  1   ,   𝐱  2   )    =     m  1     𝐱  ¨   1     (   Equation  1   )           subscript  𝐅  12     subscript  𝐱  1    subscript  𝐱  2         subscript  m  1    subscript   normal-¨  𝐱   1      Equation  1      \mathbf{F}_{12}(\mathbf{x}_{1},\mathbf{x}_{2})=m_{1}\ddot{\mathbf{x}}_{1}\quad%

 \quad\quad(\mathrm{Equation}\ 2)     where F 12 is the force on mass 1 due to its interactions with mass 2, and F 21 is the force on mass 2 due to its interactions with mass 1. The two dots on top of the x position vectors denote their second derivative, or their acceleration vectors.  Adding and subtracting these two equations decouples them into two one-body problems, which can be solved independently. Adding equations (1) and (2) results in an equation describing the center of mass ( barycenter ) motion. By contrast, subtracting equation (2) from equation (1) results in an equation that describes how the vector r = x 1 − x 2 between the masses changes with time. The solutions of these independent one-body problems can be combined to obtain the solutions for the trajectories x 1 ( t ) and x 2 ( t ).

The resulting equation:       𝐑  ¨   =  0       normal-¨  𝐑   0    \ddot{\mathbf{R}}=0     shows that the velocity V = d R / dt of the center of mass is constant, from which follows that the total momentum m 1  v 1 + m 2  v 2 is also constant ( conservation of momentum ). Hence, the position R ( t ) of the center of mass can be determined at all times from the initial positions and velocities.  Two-body motion is planar  The motion of two bodies with respect to each other always lies in a plane (in the center of mass frame ). Defining the linear momentum  p and the angular momentum  L by the equations (where μ is the reduced mass )      𝐋  =   𝐫  ×  𝐩   =    𝐫  ×  μ     d  𝐫    d  t           𝐋    𝐫  𝐩            𝐫  μ       d  𝐫     d  t        \mathbf{L}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{p}=\mathbf{r}\times\mu\frac{d\mathbf{r}}{dt}     the rate of change of the angular momentum L equals the net torque  N       𝐍  =    d  𝐋    d  t    =      𝐫  ˙   ×  μ    𝐫  ˙    +    𝐫  ×  μ     𝐫  ¨       ,        𝐍      d  𝐋     d  t                normal-˙  𝐫   μ    normal-˙  𝐫        𝐫  μ    normal-¨  𝐫        \mathbf{N}=\frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}=\dot{\mathbf{r}}\times\mu\dot{\mathbf{r}}+%
 \mathbf{r}\times\mu\ddot{\mathbf{r}}\ ,     and using the property of the vector cross product that v × w = 0 for any vectors v and w pointing in the same direction,        𝐍   =    d  𝐋    d  t    =   𝐫  ×   𝐅     ,        𝐍      d  𝐋     d  t           𝐫  𝐅      \mathbf{N}\ =\ \frac{d\mathbf{L}}{dt}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}\ ,     with F = μ d  2 r / dt  2 .  Introducing the assumption (true of most physical forces, as they obey Newton's strong third law of motion ) that the force between two particles acts along the line between their positions, it follows that r × F = 0 and the angular momentum vector L is constant (conserved). Therefore, the displacement vector r and its velocity v are always in the plane perpendicular to the constant vector L .

 _{2}(t)     Central forces  For many physical problems, the force F ( r ) is a central force , i.e., it is of the form       𝐅   (  𝐫  )    =   F   (  r  )    𝐫  ^          𝐅  𝐫     F  r   normal-^  𝐫      \mathbf{F}(\mathbf{r})=F(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}}   where r = | r | and r̂ = r /r is the corresponding unit vector . We now have:        μ   𝐫  ¨    =   F   (  r  )     𝐫  ^      ,        μ   normal-¨  𝐫      F  r   normal-^  𝐫      \mu\ddot{\mathbf{r}}={F}(r)\hat{\mathbf{r}}\ ,     where F(r) is negative in the case of an attractive force.  Work  The total work done in a given time interval by the forces exerted by two bodies on each other is the same as the work done by one force applied to the total relative displacement.
