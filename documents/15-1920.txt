   Aminopyrimidine aminohydrolase      Aminopyrimidine aminohydrolase   Aminopyrimidine aminohydrolase (, thiaminase , thiaminase II , tenA (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name 4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine aminohydrolase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) 4-amino-5-aminomethyl-2-methylpyrimidine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine + ammonia   (2) thiamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-amino-5-hydroxymethyl-2-methylpyrimidine + 5-(2-hydroxyethyl)-4-methylthiazole   This enzyme was previously known as thiaminase II.
