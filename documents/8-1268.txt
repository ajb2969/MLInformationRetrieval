Leftover hash lemma

The leftover hash lemma is a lemma in cryptography first stated by Russell Impagliazzo, Leonid Levin, and Michael Luby.
Imagine that you have a secret key

 
  that has 
 
 
 
  uniform random bits, and you would like to use this secret key to encrypt a message. Unfortunately, you were a bit careless with the key, and know that an adversary was able to learn about 
 
 
 
  bits of that key, but you do not know which. Can you still use your key, or do you have to throw it away and choose a new key? The leftover hash lemma tells us that we can produce a key of about 
 
 
 
 
  bits, over which the adversary has almost no knowledge. Since the adversary knows all but 
 
 
 
  bits, this is almost optimal.
More precisely, the leftover hash lemma tells us that we can extract a length asymptotic to 
 
 
 
  (the min-entropy of 
 
 
 
 ) bits from a random variable

 
  that are almost uniformly distributed. In other words, an adversary who has some partial knowledge about 
 
 
 
 
 , will have almost no knowledge about the extracted value. That is why this is also called privacy amplification (see privacy amplification section in the article Quantum key distribution).
Randomness extractors achieve the same result, but use (normally) less randomness.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a random variable over 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be a 2-universal hash function. If



then for 
 
 
 
  uniform over 
 
 
 
  and independent of 
 
 
 
 , we have



where 
 
 
 
 
  is uniform over 
 
 
 
  and independent of 
 
 
 
 .1

 
  is the Min-entropy of 
 
 
 
 , which measures the amount of randomness 
 
 
 
 
  has. The min-entropy is always less than or equal to the Shannon entropy. Note that 
 
 
 
  is the probability of correctly guessing 
 
 
 
 . (The best guess is to guess the most probable value.) Therefore, the min-entropy measures how difficult it is to guess 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is a statistical distance between 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
