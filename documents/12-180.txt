   Lateral surface      Lateral surface   The lateral surface of a geometric solid is the face or surface of the sides of the solid. That is, the surface of all faces or sides that are not a base side.  For a cube , the lateral surface area would be the area of four sides. Consider the edge of the cube as   a   a   a   . The area of one square face A face = a ⋅• a = a 2 . Thus the lateral surface of a cube will be the area of four faces: a ⋅ a ⋅ 4 = 4 a 2 . The lateral surface can also be calculated by multiplying the perimeter of the base to the height of the prism. 1  For a cylinder , lateral area is the area of the side surface of the cylinder: A = 2π rh .  For a pyramid , the lateral surface area is the sum of the areas of all of the triangular faces but excluding the area of the base.
