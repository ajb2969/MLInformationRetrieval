McMullen problem

The McMullen problem is an open problem in discrete geometry named after Peter McMullen.
Statement
In 1972, McMullen has proposed the following problem:1

Determine the largest number 
 
 
 
  such that for any given 
 
 
 
  points in general position in affine d-space Rd there is a projective transformation mapping these points into convex position (so they form the vertices of a convex polytope).
 

Equivalent formulations
Gale transform
Using the Gale transform, this problem can be reformulate as:

Determine the smallest number 
 
 
 
  such that every set of 
 
 
 
  points X = {x1, x2, ..., xμ(d)} in linearly general position on Sd-1 it is possible to choose a set Y = {ε1x1,ε2x2,...,εμ(d)xμ(d)} where εi = ±1 for i = 1, 2, ..., μ(d), such that every open hemisphere of Sd−1 contains at least two members of Y.
 

The number 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are connected by the relationships






Partition into nearly-disjoint hulls
Also, by simple geometric observation, it can be reformulate as:

Determine the smallest number 
 
 
 
  such that for every set X of 
 
 
 
  points in Rd there exists a partition of X into two sets A and B with
 









The relation between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is



Projective duality
 The equivalent projective dual statement to the McMullen problem is to determine the largest number 
 
 
 
  such that every set of 
 
 
hyperplanes in general position in d-dimensional real projective space form an arrangement of hyperplanes in which one of the cells is bounded by all of the hyperplanes.
Results
This problem is still open. However, the bounds of 
 
 
 
  are in the following results:

Larman proved that 
 
 
 
 . (1972)2
Michel Las Vergnas proved that 
 
 
 
 . (1986)3
Alfonsín proved that 
 
 
 
 . (2001)4

The conjecture of this problem is 
 
 
 
 , and it is true for d=2,3,4.56
