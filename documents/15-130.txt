   McMullen problem      McMullen problem   The McMullen problem is an open problem in discrete geometry named after Peter McMullen .  Statement  In 1972, McMullen has proposed the following problem: 1   Determine the largest number    ν   (  d  )       ν  d    \nu(d)   such that for any given    ν   (  d  )       ν  d    \nu(d)   points in general position in affine d -space R d there is a projective transformation mapping these points into convex position (so they form the vertices of a convex polytope ).   Equivalent formulations  Gale transform  Using the Gale transform , this problem can be reformulate as:   Determine the smallest number    μ   (  d  )       μ  d    \mu(d)   such that every set of    μ   (  d  )       μ  d    \mu(d)   points X = { x 1 , x 2 , ..., x μ ( d ) } in linearly general position on S d-1 it is possible to choose a set Y = { ε 1 x 1 , ε 2 x 2 ,..., ε μ ( d ) x μ ( d ) } where ε i = ±1 for i = 1, 2, ..., μ ( d ), such that every open hemisphere of S d −1 contains at least two members of Y.   The number    μ   (  k  )       μ  k    \mu(k)   ,    ν   (  d  )       ν  d    \nu(d)   are connected by the relationships       μ   (  k  )    =   min   {  w  ∣   w  ≤   ν   (   w  -  k  -  1   )     }          μ  k     w    w    ν    w  k  1        \mu(k)=\min\{w\mid w\leq\nu(w-k-1)\}\,          ν   (  d  )    =   max   {  w  ∣   w  ≥   μ   (   w  -  d  -  1   )     }          ν  d     w    w    μ    w  d  1        \nu(d)=\max\{w\mid w\geq\mu(w-d-1)\}\,     Partition into nearly-disjoint hulls  Also, by simple geometric observation, it can be reformulate as:   Determine the smallest number    λ   (  d  )       λ  d    \lambda(d)   such that for every set X of    λ   (  d  )       λ  d    \lambda(d)   points in R d there exists a partition of X into two sets A and B with             conv   (   A  \   {  x  }    )    ∩   conv   (   B  \   {  x  }    )     ≠  ∅   ,    ∀  x   ∈  X    .     formulae-sequence       conv   normal-\  A   x      conv   normal-\  B   x           for-all  x   X     \operatorname{conv}(A\backslash\{x\})\cap\operatorname{conv}(B\backslash\{x\})%
 \not=\varnothing,\forall x\in X.\,        The relation between   μ   μ   \mu   and   λ   λ   \lambda   is        μ   (   d  +  1   )    =   λ   (  d  )     ,   d  ≥   1       formulae-sequence      μ    d  1      λ  d      d  1     \mu(d+1)=\lambda(d),\qquad d\geq 1\,     Projective duality  The equivalent projective dual statement to the McMullen problem is to determine the largest number    ν   (  d  )       ν  d    \nu(d)   such that every set of    ν   (  d  )       ν  d    \nu(d)    hyperplanes in general position in d -dimensional real projective space form an arrangement of hyperplanes in which one of the cells is bounded by all of the hyperplanes.  Results  This problem is still open. However, the bounds of    ν   (  d  )       ν  d    \nu(d)   are in the following results:   Larman proved that      2  d   +  1   ≤   ν   (  d  )    ≤    (   d  +  1   )   2             2  d   1     ν  d         superscript    d  1   2      2d+1\leq\nu(d)\leq(d+1)^{2}   . (1972) 2  Michel Las Vergnas proved that     ν   (  d  )    ≤     (   d  +  1   )    (   d  +  2   )    2         ν  d         d  1     d  2    2     \nu(d)\leq\frac{(d+1)(d+2)}{2}   . (1986) 3  Alfonsín proved that     ν   (  d  )    ≤    2  d   +   ⌈    d  +  1   2   ⌉          ν  d       2  d         d  1   2       \nu(d)\leq 2d+\lceil\frac{d+1}{2}\rceil   . (2001) 4   The conjecture of this problem is     ν   (  d  )    =    2  d   +  1         ν  d       2  d   1     \nu(d)=2d+1   , and it is true for d=2,3,4. 5 6  References  "  Category:Discrete geometry  Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics     L.
