   Carboxymethylhydantoinase      Carboxymethylhydantoinase   In enzymology , a carboxymethylhydantoinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-5-carboxymethylhydantoin + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-5-carboxymethylhydantoin and H 2 O , whereas its product is N-carbamoyl-L-aspartate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-5-carboxymethylhydantoin amidohydrolase . This enzyme is also called hydantoin hydrolase .
