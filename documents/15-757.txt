   Bounding point      Bounding point   In functional analysis , a branch of mathematics, a bounding point of a subset of vector space is a conceptual extension of the boundary of the set.  Definition  Let    A  ⊂  X      A  X    A\subset X   for some vector space   X   X   X   . Then    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   is a bounding point for   A   A   A   if it is neither an internal point for   A   A   A   nor its complement . 1  References  "  Category:Topology  Category:Mathematical analysis     ↩
