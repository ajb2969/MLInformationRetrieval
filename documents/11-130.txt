   Tryptophan—tRNA ligase      Tryptophan—tRNA ligase   In enzymology , a tryptophan-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-tryptophan + tRNATrp   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-tryptophyl-tRNATrp   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , L-tryptophan , and tRNA(Trp) , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and L-tryptophyl-tRNATrp .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-tryptophan:tRNATrp ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include tryptophanyl-tRNA synthetase , L-tryptophan-tRNATrp ligase (AMP-forming) , tryptophanyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase , tryptophanyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase , tryptophanyl-transfer RNA synthetase , tryptophanyl ribonucleic synthetase , tryptophanyl-transfer ribonucleic synthetase , tryptophanyl-tRNA synthase , tryptophan translase , and TrpRS . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis .
