Mackey space

In mathematics, particularly in functional analysis, a Mackey space is a locally convex topological vector space X such that the topology of X coincides with the Mackey topology τ(X,X′), the finest topology which still preserves the continuous dual.
Examples
Examples of Mackey spaces include:

All bornological spaces.
All Hausdorff locally convex quasi-barrelled (and hence all Hausdorff locally convex barrelled spaces and all Hausdorff locally convex reflexive spaces).
All Hausdorff locally convex metrizable spaces.1
All Hausdorff locally convex barreled spaces.2
The product, locally convex direct sum, and the inductive limit of a family of Mackey spaces is a Mackey space.3

Properties

A locally convex space 
 
 
 
  with continuous dual 
 
 
 
  is a Mackey space if and only if each convex and 
 
 
 
 -relatively compact subset of 
 
 
 
  is equicontinuous.
The completion of a Mackey space is again a Mackey space.4
A separated quotient of a Mackey space is again a Mackey space.
A Mackey space need not be separable, complete, quasi-barrelled, nor 
 
 
 
 -quasi-barrelled.
