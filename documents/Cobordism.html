<h1>Cobordism</h1>
<hr/>
<p> In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, <strong>cobordism</strong> is a fundamental <a href="equivalence_relation" title="wikilink">equivalence relation</a> on the class of <a href="compact_space" title="wikilink">compact</a> <a href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifolds</a> of the same dimension, set up using the concept of the <a href="boundary_(topology)" title="wikilink">boundary</a> of a manifold. Two manifolds of the same dimension are <em>cobordant</em> if their <a href="disjoint_union" title="wikilink">disjoint union</a> is the <em>boundary</em> of a compact manifold one dimension higher.</p>
<p>The boundary of an (<em>n</em> + 1)-dimensional <a class="uri" href="manifold" title="wikilink">manifold</a> <em>W</em> is an <em>n</em>-dimensional manifold ∂<em>W</em> that is closed, i.e., with empty boundary. In general, a closed manifold need not be a boundary: cobordism theory is the study of the difference between all closed manifolds and those that are boundaries. The theory was originally developed for <a href="smooth_manifold" title="wikilink">smooth manifolds</a> (i.e., differentiable), but there are now also versions for <a href="#Cobordism_of_piecewise_linear_and_topological_manifolds" title="wikilink">piecewise-linear and topological manifolds</a>.</p>
<p>A <em>cobordism</em> between manifolds <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> is a compact manifold <em>W</em> whose boundary is the disjoint union of <em>M</em> and <em>N</em>, <span class="LaTeX">$\partial W=M \sqcup N$</span>.</p>
<p>Cobordisms are studied both for the equivalence relation that they generate, and as objects in their own right. Cobordism is a much coarser equivalence relation than <a class="uri" href="diffeomorphism" title="wikilink">diffeomorphism</a> or <a class="uri" href="homeomorphism" title="wikilink">homeomorphism</a> of manifolds, and is significantly easier to study and compute. It is not possible to classify manifolds up to <a class="uri" href="diffeomorphism" title="wikilink">diffeomorphism</a> or <a class="uri" href="homeomorphism" title="wikilink">homeomorphism</a> in dimensions ≥ 4 – because the <a href="word_problem_for_groups" title="wikilink">word problem for groups</a> cannot be solved – but it is possible to classify manifolds up to cobordism. Cobordisms are central objects of study in <a href="geometric_topology" title="wikilink">geometric topology</a> and <a href="algebraic_topology" title="wikilink">algebraic topology</a>. In geometric topology, cobordisms are <a href="#Connection_with_Morse_theory" title="wikilink">intimately connected</a> with <a href="Morse_theory" title="wikilink">Morse theory</a>, and <a href="h-cobordism" title="wikilink"><em>h</em>-cobordisms</a> are fundamental in the study of high-dimensional manifolds, namely <a href="surgery_theory" title="wikilink">surgery theory</a>. In algebraic topology, cobordism theories are fundamental <a href="extraordinary_cohomology_theories" title="wikilink">extraordinary cohomology theories</a>, and <a href="#Categories_of_cobordisms" title="wikilink">categories of cobordisms</a> are the domains of <a href="topological_quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">topological quantum field theories</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<h3 id="manifolds">Manifolds</h3>
<p>Roughly speaking, an <em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="manifold_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">manifold</a> <em>M</em> is a <a href="topological_space" title="wikilink">topological space</a> <a href="neighborhood_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">locally</a> (i.e., near each point) <a href="homeomorphism" title="wikilink">homeomorphic</a> to an open subset of <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a> <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup>. A <a href="manifold_with_boundary" title="wikilink">manifold with boundary</a> is similar, except that a point of <em>M</em> is allowed to have a neighborhood that is homeomorphic to the <a href="Half-space_(geometry)" title="wikilink">half-space</a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\{(x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n) \in \mathbf R^n \mid x_n \geq 0\}.$$</span></p>
<p>Those points without a neighborhood homeomorphic to an open subset of Euclidean space are the boundary points of <em>M</em>. Finally, a <a href="closed_manifold" title="wikilink">closed manifold</a> is, by definition, a <a href="compact_topological_space" title="wikilink">compact</a> manifold without boundary.</p>
<h3 id="cobordisms">Cobordisms</h3>
<p>An (<em>n</em> + 1)-dimensional <em>cobordism</em> is a <a class="uri" href="quintuple" title="wikilink">quintuple</a> (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>, <em>i</em>, <em>j</em>) consisting of an (<em>n</em> + 1)-dimensional compact differentiable manifold with boundary, <em>W</em>; closed <em>n</em>-manifolds <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>; and <a href="embedding" title="wikilink">embeddings</a> <em>i</em> : <em>M</em> ⊂ ∂<em>W</em>, <em>j</em> : <em>N</em> ⊂ ∂<em>W</em> with disjoint images such that</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\partial W = i(M) \sqcup j(N)~.$$</span></p>
<p>The terminology is usually abbreviated to (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> are called <em>cobordant</em> if such a cobordism exists. All manifolds cobordant to a fixed given manifold <em>M</em> form the <em>cobordism class</em> of <em>M</em>.</p>
<p>Every closed manifold <em>M</em> is the boundary of the non-compact manifold <em>M</em> × [0, 1); for this reason we require <em>W</em> to be compact in the definition of cobordism. Note however that <em>W</em> is <em>not</em> required to be connected; as a consequence, if <em>M</em> = ∂<em>W</em><sub>1</sub> and <em>N</em> = ∂<em>W</em><sub>2</sub>, then <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> are cobordant.</p>
<h3 id="examples">Examples</h3>
<p>The simplest example of a cobordism is the <a href="unit_interval" title="wikilink">unit interval</a> <em>I</em> = [0, 1]. It is a 1-dimensional cobordism between the 0-dimensional manifolds {0}, {1}. More generally, for any closed manifold <em>M</em>, (<em>M</em> × <em>I</em>; {0}, {1}) is a cobordism from <em>M</em> × {0} to <em>M</em> × {1}.</p>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption> A cobordism between a single circle (at the top) and a pair of disjoint circles (at the bottom).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>If <em>M</em> consists of a <a class="uri" href="circle" title="wikilink">circle</a>, and <em>N</em> of two circles, <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> together make up the boundary of a <a href="pair_of_pants_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">pair of pants</a> <em>W</em> (see the figure at right). Thus the pair of pants is a cobordism between <em>M</em> and <em>N</em>. A simpler cobordism between <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> is given by the disjoint union of three disks.</p>
<p>The pair of pants is an example of a more general cobordism: for any two <em>n</em>-dimensional manifolds <em>M</em>, <em>M</em>′, the disjoint union <span class="LaTeX">$M \sqcup M'$</span> is cobordant to the <a href="connected_sum" title="wikilink">connected sum</a> <em>M</em>#<em>M</em>′. The previous example is a particular case, since the connected sum <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup>#<strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup> is isomorphic to <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup>. The connected sum <em>M</em>#<em>M</em>′ is obtained from the disjoint union <span class="LaTeX">$M \sqcup M'$</span> by surgery on an embedding of <strong>S</strong><sup>0</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup><em>n</em></sup> in <span class="LaTeX">$M \sqcup M'$</span>, and the cobordism is the trace of the surgery.</p>
<h3 id="terminology">Terminology</h3>
<p>An <em>n</em>-manifold <em>M</em> is called <em>null-cobordant</em> if there is a cobordism between <em>M</em> and the empty manifold; in other words, if <em>M</em> is the entire boundary of some (<em>n</em> + 1)-manifold. For example, the circle (and more generally, <em>n</em>-sphere) are null-cobordant since they bound an (<em>n</em> + 1)-disk. Also, every orientable surface is null-cobordant, because it is the boundary of a <a class="uri" href="handlebody" title="wikilink">handlebody</a>. On the other hand, the 2<em>n</em>-dimensional <a href="real_projective_space" title="wikilink">real projective space</a> <strong>P</strong><sup>2<em>n</em></sup>(<strong>R</strong>) is a (compact) closed manifold that is not the boundary of a manifold, as is explained below.</p>
<p>The general <em>bordism problem</em> is to calculate the cobordism classes of manifolds subject to various conditions.</p>
<p>Null-cobordisms with additional structure are called <a href="Symplectic_filling" title="wikilink">fillings</a>. "Bordism" and "cobordism" are used by some authors interchangeably; others distinguish them. When one wishes to distinguish the study of cobordism classes from the study of cobordisms as objects in their own right, one calls the equivalence question "bordism of manifolds", and the study of cobordisms as objects "cobordisms of manifolds".</p>
<p>The term "bordism" comes from French , meaning boundary. Hence bordism is the study of boundaries. "Cobordism" means "jointly bound", so <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> are cobordant if they jointly bound a manifold, i.e., if their disjoint union is a boundary. Further, cobordism groups form an extraordinary <em>cohomology theory</em>, hence the co-.</p>
<h3 id="variants">Variants</h3>
<p>The above is the most basic form of the definition. It is also referred to as unoriented bordism. In many situations, the manifolds in question are <a href="orientability" title="wikilink">oriented</a>, or carry some other additional structure referred to as <a class="uri" href="G-structure" title="wikilink">G-structure</a>. This gives rise to <a href="#Oriented_cobordism" title="wikilink">"oriented cobordism"</a> and "cobordism with G-structure", respectively. Under favourable technical conditions these form a <a href="graded_ring" title="wikilink">graded ring</a> called the <strong>cobordism ring</strong> <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega^G_*$</span>, with grading by dimension, addition by disjoint union and multiplication by <a href="cartesian_product" title="wikilink">cartesian product</a>. The cobordism groups <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega^G_*$</span> are the coefficient groups of a <a href="#Cobordism_as_an_extraordinary_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">generalised homology theory</a>.</p>
<p>When there is additional structure, the notion of cobordism must be formulated more precisely: a <em>G</em>-structure on <em>W</em> restricts to a <em>G</em>-structure on <em>M</em> and <em>N</em>. The basic examples are <em>G</em> = O for unoriented cobordism, <em>G</em> = SO for oriented cobordism, and <em>G</em> = U for <a href="complex_cobordism" title="wikilink">complex cobordism</a> using <em>stably</em> <a href="complex_manifold" title="wikilink">complex manifolds</a>. Many more are detailed by Stong.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>In a similar vein, a standard tool in <a href="surgery_theory" title="wikilink">surgery theory</a> is surgery on <a href="normal_invariants" title="wikilink">normal maps</a>: such a process changes a normal map to another normal map within the same <a class="uri" href="bordism" title="wikilink">bordism</a> class.</p>
<p>Instead of considering additional structure, it is also possible to take into account various notions of manifold, especially <a href="Piecewise_linear_manifold" title="wikilink">piecewise linear (PL)</a> and <a href="topological_manifold" title="wikilink">topological manifolds</a>. This gives rise to bordism groups <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega_*^{PL}(X), \Omega_*^{TOP}(X)$</span>, which are harder to compute than the differentiable variants.</p>
<h2 id="surgery-construction">Surgery construction</h2>
<p>Recall that in general, if <em>X</em>, <em>Y</em> are manifolds with boundary, then the boundary of the product manifold is ∂(<em>X</em> × <em>Y</em>) = (∂<em>X</em> × <em>Y</em>) ∪ (<em>X</em> × ∂<em>Y</em>).</p>
<p>Now, given a manifold <em>M</em> of dimension <em>n</em> = <em>p</em> + <em>q</em> and an <a class="uri" href="embedding" title="wikilink">embedding</a> φ : <strong>S</strong><sup><em>p</em></sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup><em>q</em></sup> ⊂ <em>M</em>, define the <em>n</em>-manifold</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$N := (M-\operatorname{int~im}\varphi)\cup_{\varphi|_{\mathbf{S}^p\times \mathbf{S}^{q-1}}} (\mathbf{D}^{p+1}\times \mathbf{S}^{q-1})$$</span></p>
<p>obtained by <a href="Surgery_theory" title="wikilink">surgery</a>, via cutting out the interior of <strong>S</strong><sup><em>p</em></sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup><em>q</em></sup> and gluing in <strong>D</strong><sup><em>p</em>+1</sup> × <strong>S</strong><sup><em>q</em>−1</sup> along their boundary ∂(<strong>S</strong><sup><em>p</em></sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup><em>q</em></sup>) = <strong>S</strong><sup><em>p</em></sup> × <strong>S</strong><sup><em>q</em>−1</sup> = ∂(<strong>D</strong><sup><em>p</em>+1</sup> × <strong>S</strong><sup><em>q</em>−1</sup>). The <strong>trace</strong> of the surgery</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$W := (M\times I) \cup_{\mathbf{S}^p\times \mathbf{D}^q\times \{1\}} (\mathbf{D}^{p+1}\times \mathbf{D}^q)$$</span></p>
<p>defines an <strong>elementary</strong> cobordism (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>). Note that <em>M</em> is obtained from <em>N</em> by surgery on <strong>D</strong><sup><em>p</em>+1</sup> × <strong>S</strong><sup><em>q</em>−1</sup> ⊂ <em>N</em>. This is called <strong>reversing the surgery</strong>.</p>
<p>Every cobordism is a union of elementary cobordisms, by the work of <a href="Marston_Morse" title="wikilink">Morse</a>, <a href="René_Thom" title="wikilink">Thom</a> and <a href="John_Milnor" title="wikilink">Milnor</a>.</p>
<h3 id="examples-1">Examples</h3>
<p> As per the above definition, a surgery on the circle consists of cutting out a copy of <strong>S</strong><sup>0</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup>1</sup> and glueing in <strong>D</strong><sup>1</sup> × <strong>S</strong><sup>0</sup>. The pictures in Fig. 1 show that the result of doing this is either (i) <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup> again, or (ii) two copies of <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>For surgery on the 2-Sphere, In this case there are more possibilities, since we can start by cutting out either <strong>S</strong><sup>0</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup>2</sup> or <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup>1</sup>.</p>
<ul>
<li>(a) <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup>1</sup>: If we remove a cylinder from the 2-sphere, we are left with two disks. We have to glue back in <strong>S</strong><sup>0</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup>2</sup> – that is, two disks - and it's clear that the result of doing so is to give us two disjoint spheres. (Fig. 2a)</li>
</ul>
<figure><b>(Figure)</b>
<figcaption>Fig. 2c. This shape cannot be embedded in 3-space.</figcaption>

<ul>
<li>(b) <strong>S</strong><sup>0</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup>2</sup>: Having cut out two disks <strong>S</strong><sup>0</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup>2</sup>, we glue back in the cylinder <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup> × <strong>D</strong><sup>1</sup>. Interestingly, there are two possible outcomes, depending on whether our glueing maps have the same or opposite orientation on the two boundary circles. If the orientations are the same (Fig. 2b), the resulting manifold is the <a class="uri" href="torus" title="wikilink">torus</a> <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup> × <strong>S</strong><sup>1</sup>, but if they are different, we obtain the <a href="Klein_bottle" title="wikilink">Klein bottle</a> (Fig. 2c).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="morse-functions">Morse functions</h2>
<p>Suppose that <em>f</em> is a <a href="Morse_function" title="wikilink">Morse function</a> on an (<em>n</em> + 1)-dimensional manifold, and suppose that <em>c</em> is a critical value with exactly one critical point in its preimage. If the index of this critical point is <em>p</em> + 1, then the level-set <em>N</em> := <em>f</em><sup>−1</sup>(<em>c</em> + ε) is obtained from <em>M</em> := <em>f</em><sup>−1</sup>(<em>c</em> − ε) by a <em>p</em>-surgery. The inverse image <em>W</em> := <em>f</em><sup>−1</sup>([<em>c</em> − ε, <em>c</em> + ε]) defines a cobordism (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>) that can be identified with the trace of this surgery.</p>
<h3 id="geometry-and-the-connection-with-morse-theory-and-handlebodies">Geometry, and the connection with Morse theory and handlebodies</h3>
<p>Given a cobordism (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>) there exists a smooth function <em>f</em> : <em>W</em> → [0, 1] such that <em>f</em><sup>−1</sup>(0) = <em>M</em>, <em>f</em><sup>−1</sup>(1) = <em>N</em>. By general position, one can assume <em>f</em> is Morse and such that all critical points occur in the interior of <em>W</em>. In this setting <em>f</em> is called a Morse function on a cobordism. The cobordism (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>) is a union of the traces of a sequence of surgeries on <em>M</em>, one for each critical point of <em>f</em>. The manifold <em>W</em> is obtained from <em>M</em> × [0, 1] by attaching one <a href="handle_decomposition" title="wikilink">handle</a> for each critical point of <em>f</em>.</p>
<p> The Morse/Smale theorem states that for a Morse function on a cobordism, the flowlines of <em>f</em>′ give rise to a <a href="handle_decomposition" title="wikilink">handle presentation</a> of the triple (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>). Conversely, given a handle decomposition of a cobordism, it comes from a suitable Morse function. In a suitably normalized setting this process gives a correspondence between handle decompositions and Morse functions on a cobordism.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Cobordism had its roots in the (failed) attempt by <a href="Henri_Poincaré" title="wikilink">Henri Poincaré</a> in 1895 to define <a href="homology_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">homology</a> purely in terms of manifolds . Poincaré simultaneously defined both homology and cobordism, which are not the same, in general. See <a href="#Cobordism_as_an_extraordinary_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory</a> for the relationship between bordism and homology.</p>
<p>Bordism was explicitly introduced by <a href="Lev_Pontryagin" title="wikilink">Lev Pontryagin</a> in geometric work on manifolds. It came to prominence when <a href="René_Thom" title="wikilink">René Thom</a> showed that cobordism groups could be computed by means of <a href="homotopy_theory" title="wikilink">homotopy theory</a>, via the <a href="Thom_complex" title="wikilink">Thom complex</a> construction. Cobordism theory became part of the apparatus of <a href="extraordinary_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">extraordinary cohomology theory</a>, alongside <a class="uri" href="K-theory" title="wikilink">K-theory</a>. It performed an important role, historically speaking, in developments in topology in the 1950s and early 1960s, in particular in the <a href="Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch_theorem" title="wikilink">Hirzebruch–Riemann–Roch theorem</a>, and in the first proofs of the <a href="Atiyah–Singer_index_theorem" title="wikilink">Atiyah–Singer index theorem</a>.</p>
<p>In the 1980s the category with compact manifolds as objects and cobordisms between these as morphisms played a basic role in the Atiyah–Segal axioms for <a href="topological_quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">topological quantum field theory</a>, which is an important part of <a href="quantum_topology" title="wikilink">quantum topology</a>.</p>
<h2 id="categorical-aspects">Categorical aspects</h2>
<p>Cobordisms are objects of study in their own right, apart from cobordism classes. Cobordisms form a <a href="category_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">category</a> whose objects are closed manifolds and whose morphisms are cobordisms. Roughly speaking, composition is given by gluing together cobordisms end-to-end: the composition of (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>) and (<em>W</em>′; <em>N</em>, <em>P</em>) is defined by gluing the right end of the first to the left end of the second, yielding (<em>W</em>′ ∪<sub><em>N</em></sub> <em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>P</em>). A cobordism is a kind of <a class="uri" href="cospan" title="wikilink">cospan</a>:<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> <em>M</em> → <em>W</em> ← <em>N</em>. The category is a <a href="dagger_compact_category" title="wikilink">dagger compact category</a>.</p>
<p>A <a href="topological_quantum_field_theory" title="wikilink">topological quantum field theory</a> is a <a href="monoidal_functor" title="wikilink">monoidal functor</a> from a category of cobordisms to a category of <a href="vector_space" title="wikilink">vector spaces</a>. That is, it is a functor whose value on a disjoint union of manifolds is equivalent to the tensor product of its values on each of the constituent manifolds.</p>
<p>In low dimensions, the bordism question is trivial, but the category of cobordism is still interesting. For instance, the disk bounding the circle corresponds to a null-ary operation, while the cylinder corresponds to a 1-ary operation and the pair of pants to a binary operation.</p>
<h2 id="unoriented-cobordism">Unoriented cobordism</h2>
<p>The set of cobordism classes of closed unoriented <em>n</em>-dimensional manifolds is usually denoted by <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{N}_n$</span> (rather than the more systematic <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega_n^{\text{O}}$</span>); it is an <a href="abelian_group" title="wikilink">abelian group</a> with the disjoint union as operation. More specifically, if [<em>M</em>] and [<em>N</em>] denote the cobordism classes of the manifolds <em>M</em> and <em>N</em> respectively, we define <span class="LaTeX">$[M]+[N] = [M \sqcup N]$</span>; this is a well-defined operation which turns <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{N}_n$</span> into an abelian group. The identity element of this group is the class <span class="LaTeX">$[\emptyset]$</span> consisting of all closed <em>n</em>-manifolds which are boundaries. Further we have <span class="LaTeX">$[M] + [M] = [\emptyset]$</span> for every <em>M</em> since <span class="LaTeX">$M\sqcup M=\partial (M\times [0,1])$</span>. Therefore <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{N}_n$</span> is a vector space over <strong>Z</strong><sub>2</sub>, the <a href="GF(2)" title="wikilink">field with two elements</a>. The cartesian product of manifolds defines a multiplication <span class="LaTeX">$[M][N]=[M \times N]$</span>, so <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{N}_*=\sum\limits_{n \geq 0}\mathfrak{N}_n$</span> is a <a href="graded_algebra" title="wikilink">graded algebra</a>, with the grading given by the dimension.</p>
<p>The cobordism class <span class="LaTeX">$[M] \in \mathfrak{N}_n$</span> of a closed unoriented <em>n</em>-dimensional manifold <em>M</em> is determined by the Stiefel–Whitney <a href="characteristic_number" title="wikilink">characteristic numbers</a> of <em>M</em>, which depend on the stable isomorphism class of the <a href="tangent_bundle" title="wikilink">tangent bundle</a>. Thus if <em>M</em> has a stably trivial tangent bundle then <span class="LaTeX">$[M]=0 \in \mathfrak{N}_n$</span>. In 1954 <a href="René_Thom" title="wikilink">René Thom</a> computed</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\mathfrak{N}_*=\mathbf Z_2[x_i \mid i \geq 1, i \neq 2^j -1 ]$$</span></p>
<p>the polynomial algebra with one generator <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> in each dimension <em>i</em> ≠ 2<sup><em>j</em></sup>−1. Thus two unoriented closed <em>n</em>-dimensional manifolds <em>M</em>,<em>N</em> are cobordant, <span class="LaTeX">$[M]=[N] \in \mathfrak{N}_n$</span>, if and only if for each collection <span class="LaTeX">$(i_1,i_2,\ldots,i_k)$</span> of <em>k</em>-tuples of integers <span class="LaTeX">$i \geq 1, i\neq 2^j-1$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$i_1+i_2+\dots+i_k=n$</span> the Stiefel-Whitney numbers are equal</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\langle w_{i_1}(M)w_{i_2}(M) \cdots w_{i_k}(M),[M] \rangle = 
\langle w_{i_1}(N)w_{i_2}(N) \cdots w_{i_k}(N),[N] \rangle \in \mathbf Z_2$$</span> with <span class="LaTeX">$w_i(M) \in H^i(M;\mathbf Z_2)$</span> the <em>i</em>th <a href="Stiefel-Whitney_class" title="wikilink">Stiefel-Whitney class</a> and <span class="LaTeX">$[M] \in H_n(M;\mathbf Z_2)$</span> the <span class="LaTeX">$\mathbf Z_2$</span>-coefficient <a href="fundamental_class" title="wikilink">fundamental class</a>.</p>
<p>For even <em>i</em> it is possible to choose <em>x<sub>i</sub></em> =[<strong>P</strong><sup><em>i</em></sup>(<strong>R</strong>)], the cobordism class of the <em>i</em>-dimensional <a href="real_projective_space" title="wikilink">real projective space</a>.</p>
<p>The low-dimensional unoriented cobordism groups are</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align}
\mathfrak{N}_0 &=\mathbf{Z}_2, \\
\mathfrak{N}_1 &=0, \\
\mathfrak{N}_2 &=\mathbf{Z}_2, \\
\mathfrak{N}_3 &=0, \\
\mathfrak{N}_4 &=\mathbf{Z}_2 \oplus \mathbf{Z}_2, \\
\mathfrak{N}_5 & =\mathbf{Z}_2.
\end{align}$$</span></p>
<p>This shows, for example, that every 3-dimensional closed manifold is the boundary of a 4-manifold (with boundary).</p>
<p>The <a href="Modular_arithmetic" title="wikilink">mod 2</a> <a href="Euler_characteristic" title="wikilink">Euler characteristic</a> <span class="LaTeX">$\chi(M) \in \mathbf{Z}_2$</span> of an unoriented 2<em>i</em>-dimensional manifold <em>M</em> is an unoriented cobordism invariant.

<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\chi \left (\mathbf{P}^{2i_1} (\mathbf{R})\times \dots \times \mathbf{P}^{2i_k} (\mathbf{R}) \right ) = 1.$$</span></p>
<p>In particular such a product of real projective spaces is not null-cobordant. The mod 2 Euler characteristic map <span class="LaTeX">$\chi: \mathfrak{N}_{2i} \to \mathbf{Z}_2$</span> is onto for all <em>i</em> ≥ 1, and an isomorphism for <em>i</em> = 1.</p>

<p>Cobordism can also be defined for manifolds that have additional structure, notably an orientation. This is made formal in a general way using the notion of <em>X</em>-structure (or <a class="uri" href="G-structure" title="wikilink">G-structure</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> Very briefly, the <a href="normal_bundle" title="wikilink">normal bundle</a> ν of an immersion of <em>M</em> into a sufficiently high-dimensional <a href="Euclidean_space" title="wikilink">Euclidean space</a> <strong>R</strong><sup><em>n</em>+<em>k</em></sup> gives rise to a map from <em>M</em> to the <a class="uri" href="Grassmannian" title="wikilink">Grassmannian</a>, which in turn is a subspace of the <a href="classifying_space" title="wikilink">classifying space</a> of the <a href="orthogonal_group" title="wikilink">orthogonal group</a>: ν: <em>M</em> → <strong>Gr</strong>(<em>n</em>, <em>n</em> + <em>k</em>) → <em>BO</em>(<em>k</em>). Given a collection of spaces and maps <em>X<sub>k</sub></em> → <em>X<sub>k</sub></em><sub>+1</sub> with maps <em>X<sub>k</sub></em> → <em>BO</em>(<em>k</em>) (compatible with the inclusions <em>BO</em>(<em>k</em>) → <em>BO</em>(<em>k</em>+1), an <em>X</em>-structure is a lift of ν to a map <span class="LaTeX">$\tilde \nu: M \to X_k$</span>. Considering only manifolds and cobordisms with <em>X</em>-structure gives rise to a more general notion of cobordism. In particular, <em>X<sub>k</sub></em> may be given by <em>BG</em>(<em>k</em>), where <em>G</em>(<em>k</em>) → <em>O</em>(<em>k</em>) is some group homomorphism. This is referred to as a <a class="uri" href="G-structure" title="wikilink">G-structure</a>. Examples include <em>G</em> = <em>O</em>, the orthogonal group, giving back the unoriented cobordism, but also the subgroup <a href="special_linear_group" title="wikilink">SO(<em>k</em>)</a>, giving rise to <a href="oriented_cobordism" title="wikilink">oriented cobordism</a>, the <a href="spin_group" title="wikilink">spin group</a>, the <a href="unitary_group" title="wikilink">unitary group <em>U</em>(<em>k</em>)</a>, and the trivial group, giving rise to <a href="framed_cobordism" title="wikilink">framed cobordism</a>.</p>
<p>The resulting cobordism groups are then defined analogously to the unoriented case. They are denote by <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega^G_*$</span>.</p>
<h3 id="oriented-cobordism">Oriented cobordism</h3>
<p>Oriented cobordism is the one of manifolds with an SO-structure. Equivalently, all manifolds need to be <a href="orientability" title="wikilink">oriented</a> and cobordisms (<em>W</em>, <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>) (also referred to as <em>oriented cobordisms</em> for clarity) are such that the boundary (with the induced orientations) is <span class="LaTeX">$M \sqcup (-N)$</span>, where −<em>N</em> denotes <em>N</em> with the reversed orientation. For example, boundary of the cylinder <em>M</em> × <em>I</em> is <span class="LaTeX">$M \sqcup (-M)$</span>: both ends have opposite orientations. It is also the correct definition in the sense of <a href="extraordinary_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">extraordinary cohomology theory</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike in the unoriented cobordism group, where every element is two-torsion, 2<em>M</em> is not in general an oriented boundary, that is, 2[<em>M</em>] ≠ 0 belongs to <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega_*^{\text{SO}}.$</span></p>
<p>The oriented cobordism groups are given modulo torsion by</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Omega_*^{\text{SO}}\otimes \mathbf{Q}=\mathbf{Q}[y_{4i}|i \geq 1],$$</span></p>
<p>the polynomial algebra generated by the oriented cobordism classes</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$y_{4i}=\left [\mathbf{P}^{2i}(\mathbf{C}) \right ] \in \Omega_{4i}^{\text{SO}}$$</span></p>
<p>of the <a href="complex_projective_space" title="wikilink">complex projective spaces</a> (Thom, 1952). The oriented cobordism group <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega_*^{\text{SO}}$</span> is determined by the Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin <a href="characteristic_number" title="wikilink">characteristic numbers</a> (Wall, 1960). Two oriented manifolds are oriented cobordant if and only if their Stiefel–Whitney and Pontrjagin numbers are the same.</p>
<p>The low-dimensional oriented cobordism groups are :</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{align} 
\Omega_0^{\text{SO}} &= \mathbf{Z}, \\
\Omega_1^{\text{SO}} &= 0, \\
\Omega_2^{\text{SO}} &= 0, \\
\Omega_3^{\text{SO}} &= 0, \\
\Omega_4^{\text{SO}} &= \mathbf{Z}, \\
\Omega_5^{\text{SO}} &= \mathbf{Z}_2.
\end{align}$$</span></p>
<p>The <a href="Signature_of_a_manifold" title="wikilink">signature</a> of an oriented 4<em>i</em>-dimensional manifold <em>M</em></p>
<dl>
<dd>σ(<em>M</em>) = signature of the intersection form on <em>H</em><sup>2<em>i</em></sup>(<em>M</em>) ∈ <strong>Z</strong>,
</dd>
</dl>
<p>is an oriented cobordism invariant, which is expressed in terms of the Pontrjagin numbers by the <a href="Hirzebruch_signature_theorem" title="wikilink">Hirzebruch signature theorem</a>.</p>
<p>For example, for any <em>i</em><sub>1</sub>, ..., <em>i<sub>k</sub></em> ≥ 1</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\sigma \left (\mathbf{P}^{2i_1}(\mathbf{C}) \times \dots \times \mathbf{P}^{2i_k}(\mathbf{C}) \right) = 1.$$</span></p>
<p>The signature map <span class="LaTeX">$\sigma:\Omega_{4i}^{\text{SO}} \to \mathbf{Z}$</span> is onto for all <em>i</em> ≥ 1, and an isomorphism for <em>i</em> = 1.</p>
<h2 id="cobordism-as-an-extraordinary-cohomology-theory">Cobordism as an extraordinary cohomology theory</h2>
<p>Every <a href="vector_bundle" title="wikilink">vector bundle</a> theory (real, complex etc.) has an <a href="extraordinary_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">extraordinary cohomology theory</a> called <a class="uri" href="K-theory" title="wikilink">K-theory</a>. Similarly, every cobordism theory Ω<sup><em>G</em></sup> has an <a href="extraordinary_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">extraordinary cohomology theory</a>, with homology ("bordism") groups <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega^G_n(X)$</span> and cohomology ("cobordism") groups <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega^n_G(X)$</span> for any space <em>X</em>. The generalized homology groups <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega_*^G(X)$</span> are <a href="Covariance" title="wikilink">covariant</a> in <em>X</em>, and the generalized cohomology groups <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega^*_G(X)$</span> are <a href="Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors" title="wikilink">contravariant</a> in <em>X</em>. The cobordism groups defined above are, from this point of view, the homology groups of a point<span class="LaTeX">$$\Omega_n^G = \Omega_n^G(\text{pt})$$</span>. Then <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega^G_n(X)$</span> is the group of <em>bordism</em> classes of pairs (<em>M</em>, <em>f</em>) with <em>M</em> a closed <em>n</em>-dimensional manifold <em>M</em> (with G-structure) and <em>f</em> : <em>M</em> → <em>X</em> a map. Such pairs (<em>M</em>, <em>f</em>), (<em>N</em>, <em>g</em>) are <em>bordant</em> if there exists a G-cobordism (<em>W</em>; <em>M</em>, <em>N</em>) with a map <em>h</em> : <em>W</em> → <em>X</em>, which restricts to <em>f</em> on <em>M</em>, and to <em>g</em> on <em>N</em>.</p>
<p>An <em>n</em>-dimensional manifold <em>M</em> has a <a href="Homology_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">fundamental homology class</a> [<em>M</em>] ∈ <em>H<sub>n</sub></em>(<em>M</em>) (with coefficients in <strong>Z</strong><sub>2</sub> in general, and in <strong>Z</strong> in the oriented case), defining a natural transformation</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\begin{cases}
\Omega^G_n(X) \to H_n(X) \\
(M,f) \mapsto f_*[M]
\end{cases}$$</span></p>
<p>which is far from being an isomorphism in general.</p>
<p>The bordism and cobordism theories of a space satisfy the <a href="Eilenberg–Steenrod_axioms" title="wikilink">Eilenberg–Steenrod axioms</a> apart from the dimension axiom. This does not mean that the groups <span class="LaTeX">$\Omega^n_G(X)$</span> can be effectively computed once one knows the cobordism theory of a point and the homology of the space <em>X</em>, though the <a href="Atiyah–Hirzebruch_spectral_sequence" title="wikilink">Atiyah–Hirzebruch spectral sequence</a> gives a starting point for calculations. The computation is only easy if the particular cobordism theory <a href="#Cobordism_as_an_extraordinary_cohomology_theory" title="wikilink">reduces to a product of ordinary homology theories</a>, in which case the bordism groups are the ordinary homology groups</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\Omega^G_n(X)=\sum\limits_{p+q=n}H_p(X;\Omega^G_q(\text{pt})).$$</span></p>
<p>This is true for unoriented cobordism. Other cobordism theories do not reduce to ordinary homology in this way, notably <a href="Pontrjagin–Thom_construction#Framed_cobordism" title="wikilink">framed cobordism</a>, oriented cobordism and <a href="complex_cobordism" title="wikilink">complex cobordism</a>. The last-named theory in particular is much used by algebraic topologists as a computational tool (e.g., for the <a href="homotopy_groups_of_spheres" title="wikilink">homotopy groups of spheres</a>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>Cobordism theories are represented by <a href="Thom_spectrum" title="wikilink">Thom spectra</a> <em>MG</em>: given a group <em>G</em>, the Thom spectrum is composed from the <a href="Thom_space" title="wikilink">Thom spaces</a> <em>MG<sub>n</sub></em> of the <a href="tautological_bundle" title="wikilink">standard vector bundles</a> over the <a href="classifying_space" title="wikilink">classifying spaces</a> <em>BG<sub>n</sub></em>. Note that even for similar groups, Thom spectra can be very different: <em>MSO</em> and <em>MO</em> are very different, reflecting the difference between oriented and unoriented cobordism.</p>
<p>From the point of view of spectra, unoriented cobordism is a product of <a href="Eilenberg–MacLane_spectrum" title="wikilink">Eilenberg–MacLane spectra</a> – <em>MO</em> = <em>H</em>(π<sub>∗</sub>(<em>MO</em>)) – while oriented cobordism is a product of Eilenberg–MacLane spectra rationally, and at 2, but not at odd primes: the oriented cobordism spectrum <em>MSO</em> is rather more complicated than <em>MO</em>.</p>
