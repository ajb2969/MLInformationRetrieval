Simplicial homotopy

In algebraic topology, a simplicial homotopy is an analog of a homotopy between topological spaces for simplicial sets. If


 
  are maps between simplicial sets, a simplicial homotopy from f to g is a map


 
  such that the obvious diagram (see [https://books.google.com/books?id=iFv2BwAAQBAJ&pg;;=PA23&lpg;=PA23&dq;=%22simplicial+homotopy%22&source;=bl&ots;=qkFEJf6ZNB&sig;=u0VcENvg59uMv8EBqbTeL9dkPks&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=Kf1qVeWQJ-GIsQT834CgDg&ved;=0CDQQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q;=%22simplicial%20homotopy%22&f;=false]) formed by f, g and h commute; the key is to use the diagram that results in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  for all x in X.
