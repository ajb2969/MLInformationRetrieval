   Simplicial homotopy      Simplicial homotopy   In algebraic topology, a simplicial homotopy is an analog of a homotopy between topological spaces for simplicial sets . If       f  ,  g   :   X  →  Y      normal-:   f  g    normal-→  X  Y     f,g:X\to Y   are maps between simplicial sets, a simplicial homotopy from f to g is a map      h  :    X  ×   △  1    →  Y      normal-:  h   normal-→    X   superscript  normal-△  1    Y     h:X\times\triangle^{1}\to Y   such that the obvious diagram (see [ https://books.google.com/books?id=iFv2BwAAQBAJ&pg; ;=PA23&lpg;=PA23&dq;=%22simplicial+homotopy%22&source;=bl&ots;=qkFEJf6ZNB&sig;=u0VcENvg59uMv8EBqbTeL9dkPks&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=Kf1qVeWQJ-GIsQT834CgDg&ved;=0CDQQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&q;=%22simplicial%20homotopy%22&f;=false]) formed by f , g and h commute; the key is to use the diagram that results in     f   (  x  )    =   h   (  x  ,  0  )          f  x     h   x  0      f(x)=h(x,0)   and     g   (  x  )    =   h   (  x  ,  1  )          g  x     h   x  1      g(x)=h(x,1)   for all x in X .
