Continuous function (set theory)

In mathematics, specifically set theory, a continuous function is a sequence of ordinals such that the values assumed at limit stages are the limits (limit suprema and limit infima) of all values at previous stages. More formally, let γ be an ordinal, and 
 
 
 
  be a γ-sequence of ordinals. Then s is continuous if at every limit ordinal β s_{\beta} = \limsup\{s_{\alpha}| \alpha 
and



Alternatively, s is continuous if s: γ → range(s) is a continuous function when the sets are each equipped with the order topology. These continuous functions are often used in cofinalities and cardinal numbers.
