   Continuous function (set theory)      Continuous function (set theory)   In mathematics , specifically set theory , a continuous function is a sequence of ordinals such that the values assumed at limit stages are the limits ( limit suprema and limit infima ) of all values at previous stages. More formally, let γ be an ordinal, and    s  :=    ⟨   s  α   |   α   <  γ  ⟩       assign  s     bra   subscript  s  α    α   delimited-<⟩  γ      s:=\langle s_{\alpha}|\alpha<\gamma\rangle   be a γ-sequence of ordinals. Then s is continuous if at every limit ordinal β s_{\beta} = \limsup\{s_{\alpha}| \alpha  and        s  β   =   lim inf   {   s  α   |   α  <  β   }    =   sup   {   inf   {   s  α   |   δ  ≤  α  <  β   }    |   δ  <  β   }     .         subscript  s  β    limit-infimum   conditional-set   subscript  s  α     α  β           supremum   conditional-set   infimum   conditional-set   subscript  s  α       δ  α       β        δ  β        s_{\beta}=\liminf\{s_{\alpha}|\alpha<\beta\}=\sup\{\inf\{s_{\alpha}|\delta\leq%
 \alpha<\beta\}|\delta<\beta\}\,.     Alternatively, s is continuous if s : γ → range(s) is a continuous function when the sets are each equipped with the order topology . These continuous functions are often used in cofinalities and cardinal numbers .  References   Thomas Jech .
