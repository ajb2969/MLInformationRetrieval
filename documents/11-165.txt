   4-oxalmesaconate hydratase      4-oxalmesaconate hydratase   In enzymology , a 4-oxalmesaconate hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-hydroxy-4-oxobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (E)-4-oxobut-1-ene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-hydroxy-4-oxobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate , and two products , (E)-4-oxobut-1-ene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-hydroxy-4-oxobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate 2,3-hydro-lyase [(E)-4-oxobut-1-ene-1,2,4-tricarboxylate-forming] . Other names in common use include 4-carboxy-2-oxohexenedioate hydratase , 4-carboxy-2-oxobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate 2,3-hydro-lyase , oxalmesaconate hydratase , gamma-oxalmesaconate hydratase , 4-carboxy-2-oxohexenedioate hydratase , and 2-hydroxy-4-oxobutane-1,2,4-tricarboxylate 2,3-hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in benzoate degradation via hydroxylation .  References     "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
