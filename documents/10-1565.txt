Tauropine dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a tauropine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

tauropine + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  taurine + pyruvate + NADH + H+


The 3 products of this enzyme are tauropine, NAD+, and H2O, whereas its 4 substrates are taurine, pyruvate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N2-(D-1-carboxyethyl)taurine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (taurine-forming). This enzyme is also called 2-N-(D-1-carboxyethyl)taurine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (taurine-forming).
