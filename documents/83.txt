   BCK algebra      BCK algebra   In mathematics, BCI and BCK algebras are algebraic structures, introduced by Y. Imai, K. Iséki and S. Tanaka in 1966, that describe fragments of the propositional calculus involving implication known as BCI and BCK logics .  Definition  BCI algebra  An algebra $\left( X;\ast
 ,0\right)$ of type $\left( 2,0\right)$ is called a BCI-algebra if, for any $x,y,z\in X$ , it satisfies the following conditions. (Informally, we may read $0$ as "truth" and $x\ast y$ as " $y$ implies $x$ ".)   BCI-1: \left( \left( x\ast y\right) \ast \left( x\ast z\right)   \right) \ast \left( z\ast y\right) =0   BCI-2 $$\left( x\ast \left( x\ast y\right) \right) \ast y=0$$ BCI-3 $$x\ast x=0$$ BCI-4 $$x\ast y=0 \and y\ast x=0\implies x=y$$ BCI-5 $$x\ast 0=0 \implies x=0$$   BCK algebra  A BCI-algebra $\left( X;\ast ,0\right)$ is called a BCK-algebra if it satisfies the following condition:   BCK-1 $$\forall x\in X: 0\ast x=0$$   A partial order can then be defined as x ≤ y iff x * y = 0.  A BCK-algebra is said to be commutative if it satisfies:  $$x\ast (x\ast y)= y\ast (y\ast x)$$ In a commutative BCK-algebra x * ( x * y ) = x ∧ y , the greatest lower bound of x and y under the partial order ≤.  A BCK-algebra is said to be bounded if it has a largest element, usually denoted by 1. In a bounded commutative BCK-algebra the least upper bound of two elements x ∨ y = 1 * ((1 * x ) ∧ (1 * y )), which makes it a distributive lattice .  Examples  Every abelian group is a BCI-algebra, with * group subtraction and 0 the group identity.  The subsets of a set form a BCK-algebra, where A*B is the difference A\B (elements in A but not in B), and 0 is the empty set .  A Boolean algebra is a BCK algebra if A * B is defined to be A ∧¬ B ( A does not imply B ).  The bounded commutative BCK-algebras are precisely the MV-algebras .  References         Y.
