   Omega-amidase      Omega-amidase   In enzymology , an omega-amidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a monoamide of a dicarboxylic acid + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a dicarboxylate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are monoamide of a dicarboxylic acid and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dicarboxylate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is omega-amidodicarboxylate amidohydrolase . This enzyme is also called alpha-keto acid-omega-amidase . This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and alanine and aspartate metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
