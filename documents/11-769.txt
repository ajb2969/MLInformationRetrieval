Omega-amidase




Omega-amidase

In enzymology, an omega-amidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

a monoamide of a dicarboxylic acid + H2O 
 
 
 
  a dicarboxylate + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are monoamide of a dicarboxylic acid and H2O, whereas its two products are dicarboxylate and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is omega-amidodicarboxylate amidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called alpha-keto acid-omega-amidase. This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and alanine and aspartate metabolism.
