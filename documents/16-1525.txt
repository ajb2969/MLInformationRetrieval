   Cotangent sheaf      Cotangent sheaf   In algebraic geometry, given a morphism f : X → S of schemes, the cotangent sheaf on X is the sheaf of    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   -modules that represents (or classifies) S - derivations  1 in the sense: for any    𝒪  X     subscript  𝒪  X    \mathcal{O}_{X}   -modules F , there is an isomorphism        Hom   𝒪  X     (   Ω   X  /  S    ,  F  )    =    Der  S    (   𝒪  X   ,  F  )          subscript  Hom   subscript  𝒪  X     subscript  normal-Ω    X  S    F     subscript  Der  S    subscript  𝒪  X   F     \operatorname{Hom}_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}(\Omega_{X/S},F)=\operatorname{Der}_{S}(%
 \mathcal{O}_{X},F)   that depends naturally on F . In other words, the cotangent sheaf is characterized by the universal property: there is the differential    d  :    𝒪  X   →   Ω   X  /  S        normal-:  d   normal-→   subscript  𝒪  X    subscript  normal-Ω    X  S       d:\mathcal{O}_{X}\to\Omega_{X/S}   such that any S -derivation    D  :    𝒪  X   →  F      normal-:  D   normal-→   subscript  𝒪  X   F     D:\mathcal{O}_{X}\to F   factors as    D  =   α  ∘  d       D    α  d     D=\alpha\circ d   with some    α  :    Ω   X  /  S    →  F      normal-:  α   normal-→   subscript  normal-Ω    X  S    F     \alpha:\Omega_{X/S}\to F   .  In the case X and S are affine schemes, the above definition means that    Ω   X  /  S      subscript  normal-Ω    X  S     \Omega_{X/S}   is the module of Kähler differentials . The standard way to construct a cotangent sheaf (e.g., Hartshorne, Ch II. § 8) is through a diagonal morphism (which amounts to gluing modules of Kähler differentials on affine charts to get the globally-defined cotangent sheaf.) The dual module of the cotangent sheaf on a scheme X is called the tangent sheaf on X and is sometimes denoted by    Θ  X     subscript  normal-Θ  X    \Theta_{X}   . In concise terms, this means:         Θ  X    =  def   ℋ  o   m   𝒪  X     (   Ω  X   ,   𝒪  X   )    =   𝒟  e  r   (   𝒪  X   )     .         subscript  normal-Θ  X    def    ℋ  o   subscript  m   subscript  𝒪  X      subscript  normal-Ω  X    subscript  𝒪  X       𝒟  e  r   subscript  𝒪  X      \Theta_{X}\overset{\mathrm{def}}{=}\mathcal{H}om_{\mathcal{O}_{X}}(\Omega_{X},%
 \mathcal{O}_{X})=\mathcal{D}er(\mathcal{O}_{X}).     There are two important exact sequences:   If S → T is a morphism of schemes, then       f  *    Ω   S  /  T     →   Ω   X  /  T    →   Ω   X  /  S    →  0.       normal-→     superscript  f     subscript  normal-Ω    S  T      subscript  normal-Ω    X  T      normal-→     subscript  normal-Ω    X  S      normal-→    0.     f^{*}\Omega_{S/T}\to\Omega_{X/T}\to\Omega_{X/S}\to 0.     If Z is a closed subscheme of X with ideal sheaf I , then      I  /   I  2    →    Ω   X  /  S    ⊗   𝒪  Z    →   Ω   Z  /  S    →  0.       normal-→    I   superscript  I  2     tensor-product   subscript  normal-Ω    X  S     subscript  𝒪  Z      normal-→     subscript  normal-Ω    Z  S      normal-→    0.     I/I^{2}\to\Omega_{X/S}\otimes\mathcal{O}_{Z}\to\Omega_{Z/S}\to 0.    2 3   The cotangent sheaf is closely related to smoothness of a variety or scheme. For example, an algebraic variety is smooth of dimension n if and only if Ω X is a locally free sheaf of rank n . 4  Construction through a diagonal morphism  Let    f  :   X  →  S      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  S     f:X\to S   be a morphism of schemes as in the introduction and Δ: X → X × S  X the diagonal morphism. Then the image of Δ is locally closed ; i.e., closed in some open subset W of X × S  X (the image is closed if and only if f is separated ). Let I be the ideal sheaf of Δ( X ) in W . One then puts:       Ω   X  /  S    =    Δ  *    (   I  /   I  2    )         subscript  normal-Ω    X  S       superscript  normal-Δ      I   superscript  I  2       \Omega_{X/S}=\Delta^{*}(I/I^{2})   and checks this sheaf of modules satisfies the required universal property of a cotangent sheaf (Hartshorne, Ch II. Remark 8.9.2). The construction shows in particular that the cotangent sheaf is quasi-coherent . It is coherent if S is Noetherian and f is of finite type.  Relation to a tautological line bundle  The cotangent sheaf on a projective space is related to the tautological line bundle  O (-1) by the following exact sequence: writing    𝐏  R  n     subscript   superscript  𝐏  n   R    \mathbf{P}^{n}_{R}   for the projective space over a ring R ,      0  →   Ω    𝐏  R  n   /  R    →    𝒪   𝐏  R  n      (   -  1   )    ⊕   (   n  +  1   )      →   𝒪   𝐏  R  n    →  0.       normal-→  0   subscript  normal-Ω     subscript   superscript  𝐏  n   R   R      normal-→       subscript  𝒪   subscript   superscript  𝐏  n   R     superscript    1    direct-sum    n  1        normal-→     subscript  𝒪   subscript   superscript  𝐏  n   R      normal-→    0.     0\to\Omega_{\mathbf{P}^{n}_{R}/R}\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbf{P}^{n}_{R}}(-1)^{%
 \oplus(n+1)}\to\mathcal{O}_{\mathbf{P}^{n}_{R}}\to 0.     (See also Chern class#Complex projective space .)  Cotangent stack  For this notion, see § 1 of   A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld, Quantization of Hitchin’s integrable system and Hecke eigensheaves 1 5    There, the cotangent stack on an algebraic stack X is defined as the relative Spec of the symmetric algebra of the tangent sheaf on X . (Note: in general, if E is a locally free sheaf of finite rank,    𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐜   (   Sym   (   E  ˇ   )    )       𝐒𝐩𝐞𝐜   Sym   normal-ˇ  E      \mathbf{Spec}(\operatorname{Sym}(\check{E}))   is the algebraic vector bundle corresponding to E .)  See also: Hitchin fibration (the cotangent stack of     Bun  G    (  X  )       subscript  Bun  G   X    \operatorname{Bun}_{G}(X)   is the total space of the Hitchin fibration.)
