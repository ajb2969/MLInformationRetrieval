Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress–energy tensor

In mathematical physics, the Belinfante–Rosenfeld tensor is a modification of the energy–momentum tensor that is constructed from the canonical energy–momentum tensor and the spin current so as to be symmetric yet still conserved.
In a classical or quantum local field theory, the generator of Lorentz transformations can be written as an integral



of a local current



Here 
 
 
 
  is the canonical Noether energy–momentum tensor, and 
 
 
 
  is the contribution of the intrinsic (spin) angular momentum. Local conservation of angular momentum



requires that



Thus a source of spin-current implies a non-symmetric canonical energy–momentum tensor.
The Belinfante–Rosenfeld tensor12 is a modification of the energy momentum tensor



that is constructed from the canonical energy momentum tensor and the spin current 
 
 
 
  so as to be symmetric yet still conserved.
An integration by parts shows that



and so a physical interpretation of Belinfante tensor is that it includes the "bound momentum" associated with gradients of the intrinsic angular momentum. In other words, the added term is an analogue of the 
 
 
 
  "bound current" associated with a magnetization density 
 
 
 
 .
The curious combination of spin-current components required to make 
 
 
 
  symmetric and yet still conserved seems totally ad hoc, but it was shown by both Rosenfeld and Belinfante that the modified tensor is precisely the symmetric Hilbert energy–momentum tensor that acts as the source of gravity in general relativity. Just as it is the sum of the bound and free currents that acts as a source of the magnetic field, it is the sum of the bound and free energy–momentum that acts as a source of gravity.
Weinberg defines the Belinfante tensor as3


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Lagrangian (density), the set {Ψ} are the fields appearing in the Lagrangian, the non-Belinfante energy momentum tensor is defined by


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are a set of matrices satisfying the algebra of the homogeneous Lorentz group4
