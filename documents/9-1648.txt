Knödel number

In number theory, a Knödel number for a given positive integer n is a composite number m with the property that each i i^{m - n} \equiv 1 \pmod{m}. The concept is named after Walter Knödel.1 The set of all Knödel numbers for n is denoted Kn.
The special case K1 are the Carmichael numbers.
Every composite number is a Knödel number. This can be seen by setting 
 
 
 
  equal to

Walter Knödel, born May 20th, 1926 in Vienna, earned a Ph.D. in number theory in 1948 (advisors: Edmund Hlawka and Johann Radon) and obtained the habilitation in 1953. Since 1961 he is professor at University of Stuttgart, establishing the new department of computer science. See also The web page on Walter Knödel at the University of Stuttgart.↩
