   Spherium      Spherium   The " spherium " model consists of two electrons trapped on the surface of a sphere of radius   R   R   R   . It has been used by Berry and collaborators 1 to understand both weakly and strongly correlated systems and to suggest an "alternating" version of Hund's rule . Seidl studies this system in the context of density functional theory (DFT) to develop new correlation functionals within the adiabatic connection . 2  The electronic Hamiltonian in atomic units is       H  ^   =     -    ∇  1  2   2    -    ∇  2  2   2    +   1  u         normal-^  H            superscript   subscript  normal-∇  1   2   2       superscript   subscript  normal-∇  2   2   2      1  u      \hat{H}=-\frac{\nabla_{1}^{2}}{2}-\frac{\nabla_{2}^{2}}{2}+\frac{1}{u}     where   u   u   u   is the interelectronic distance. For the singlet S states, it can be then shown 3 that the wave function     S   (  u  )       S  u    S(u)   satisfies the Schrödinger equation         (     u  2    4   R  2     -  1   )      d  2   S   (  u  )     d   u  2      +    (     3  u    4   R  2     -   1  u    )     d  S   (  u  )     d  u     +    1  u   S   (  u  )     =   E  S   (  u  )                 superscript  u  2     4   superscript  R  2     1        superscript  d  2   S  u     d   superscript  u  2              3  u     4   superscript  R  2       1  u        d  S  u     d  u         1  u   S  u      E  S  u     \left(\frac{u^{2}}{4R^{2}}-1\right)\frac{d^{2}S(u)}{du^{2}}+\left(\frac{3u}{4R%
 ^{2}}-\frac{1}{u}\right)\frac{dS(u)}{du}+\frac{1}{u}S(u)=ES(u)     By introducing the dimensionless variable    x  =    u  /  2   R       x      u  2   R     x=u/2R   , this becomes a Heun equation with singular points at    x  =    -  1   ,  0  ,   +  1        x     1   0    1      x=-1,0,+1   . Based on the known solutions of the Heun equation, we seek wave functions of the form       S   (  u  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞      s  k     u  k           S  u     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript  s  k    superscript  u  k       S(u)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}s_{k}\,u^{k}     and substitution into the previous equation yields the recurrence relation       s   k  +  2    =     s   k  +  1    +    [    k   (   k  +  2   )    1   4   R  2      -  E   ]    s  k       (   k  +  2   )   2         subscript  s    k  2         subscript  s    k  1       delimited-[]      k    k  2     1    4   superscript  R  2      E     subscript  s  k      superscript    k  2   2      s_{k+2}=\frac{s_{k+1}+\left[k(k+2)\frac{1}{4R^{2}}-E\right]s_{k}}{(k+2)^{2}}     with the starting values     s  0   =   s  1   =  1         subscript  s  0    subscript  s  1        1     s_{0}=s_{1}=1   . Thus, the Kato cusp condition is         S  ′    (  0  )     S   (  0  )     =  1           superscript  S  normal-′   0     S  0    1    \frac{S^{\prime}(0)}{S(0)}=1   .  The wave function reduces to the polynomial        S   n  ,  m     (  u  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   n      s  k     u  k            subscript  S   n  m    u     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  s  k    superscript  u  k       S_{n,m}(u)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}s_{k}\,u^{k}     (where   m   m   m   the number of roots between   0   0    and    2  R      2  R    2R   ) if, and only if,     s   n  +  1    =   s   n  +  2    =  0         subscript  s    n  1     subscript  s    n  2         0     s_{n+1}=s_{n+2}=0   . Thus, the energy    E   n  ,  m      subscript  E   n  m     E_{n,m}   is a root of the polynomial equation     s   n  +  1    =  0       subscript  s    n  1    0    s_{n+1}=0   (where     deg   s   n  +  1     =   ⌊    (   n  +  1   )   /  2   ⌋        degree   subscript  s    n  1           n  1   2      \deg s_{n+1}=\lfloor(n+1)/2\rfloor   ) and the corresponding radius    R   n  ,  m      subscript  R   n  m     R_{n,m}   is found from the previous equation which yields        R   n  ,  m   2    E   n  ,  m     =    n  2    (    n  2   +  1   )           superscript   subscript  R   n  m    2    subscript  E   n  m         n  2       n  2   1      R_{n,m}^{2}E_{n,m}=\frac{n}{2}\left(\frac{n}{2}+1\right)        S   n  ,  m     (  u  )        subscript  S   n  m    u    S_{n,m}(u)   is the exact wave function of the   m   m   m   -th excited state of singlet S symmetry for the radius    R   n  ,  m      subscript  R   n  m     R_{n,m}   .  We know from the work of Loos and Gill 4 that the HF energy of the lowest singlet S state is     E  HF   =   1  /  R        subscript  E  HF     1  R     E_{\rm HF}=1/R   . It follows that the exact correlation energy for    R  =    3   /  2       R      3   2     R=\sqrt{3}/2   is     E  corr   =   1  -   2  /   3     ≈   -  0.1547          subscript  E  corr     1    2    3            0.1547      E_{\rm corr}=1-2/\sqrt{3}\approx-0.1547   which is much larger than the limiting correlation energies of the helium-like ions (    -  0.0467      0.0467    -0.0467   ) or Hooke's atoms (    -  0.0497      0.0497    -0.0497   ). This confirms the view that electron correlation on the surface of a sphere is qualitatively different from that in three-dimensional physical space.  Spherium on a 3-Sphere  Recent work by Loos et al. 5 considered the case of two electrons confined to a 3-sphere repelling Coulombically. They report a ground state energy of (    -  .0476      .0476    -.0476   ).
