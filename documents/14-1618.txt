Fowlkes–Mallows index

Fowlkes–Mallows index1 is an external evaluation method that is used to determine the similarity between two clusterings (clusters obtained after a clustering algorithm). This measure of similarity could be either between two hierarchical clusterings or a clustering and a benchmark classification. A higher value for the Fowlkes–Mallows index indicates a greater similarity between the clusters and the benchmark classifications.
Preliminaries
The Fowlkes–Mallows index, when results of two clustering algorithms is used to evaluate the results, is defined as2




where 
 
 
 
  is the number of true positives, 
 
 
 
  is the number of false positives, and 
 
 
 
 
  is the number of false negatives.
 

Definition
Consider two hierarchical clusterings of 
 
 
 
  objects labeled 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The trees 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  can be cut to produce 
 
 
 
  clusters for each tree (by either selecting clusters at a particular height of the tree or setting different strength of the hierarchical clustering). For each value of 
 
 
 
 , the following table can then be created



where 
 
 
 
  is of objects common between the 
 
 
 
 
 th cluster of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 th cluster of 
 
 
 
 . The Fowlkes–Mallows index for the specific value of 
 
 
 
  is then defined as


 
  where









 
  can then be calculated for every value of 
 
 
 
 
  and the similarity between the two clusterings can be shown by plotting 
 
 
 
  versus 
 
 
 
 . For each 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 .
Fowlkes–Mallows index can also be defined based on the number of points that are common or uncommon in the two hierarchical clusterings. If we define


 
  as the number of points that are present in the same cluster in both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .


 
  as the number of points that are present in the same cluster in 
 
 
 
  but not in 
 
 
 
 
 .


 
  as the number of points that are present in the same cluster in 
 
 
 
  but not in 
 
 
 
 .


 
  as the number of points that are in different clusters in both 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
It can be shown that the four counts have the following property



and that the Fowlkes–Mallows index for two clusterings can be defined as3




where 
 
 
 
  is the number of true positives, 
 
 
 
 
  is the number of false positives, and 
 
 
 
  is the number of false negatives.
 

Discussion
Since the index is directly proportional to the number of true positives, a higher index means greater similarity between the two clusterings used to determine the index. One of the most basic thing to test the validity of this index is to compare two clusterings that are unrelated to each other. Fowlkes and Mallows showed that on using two unrelated clusterings, the value of this index approaches zero as the number of total data points chosen for clustering increase; whereas the value for the Rand index for the same data quickly approaches 
 
 
4 making Fowlkes–Mallows index a much accurate representation for unrelated data. This index also performs well if noise is added to an existing dataset and their similarity compared. Fowlkes and Mallows showed that the value of the index decreases as the component of the noise increases. The index also showed similarity even when the noisy dataset had different number of clusters than the clusters of the original dataset. Thus making it a reliable tool for measuring similarity between two clusters.
