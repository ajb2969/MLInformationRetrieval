   Telescoping series      Telescoping series   In mathematics , a telescoping series is a series whose partial sums eventually only have a fixed number of terms after cancellation. 1 2 Such a technique is also known as the method of differences .  For example, the series       ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n   (   n  +  1   )         superscript   subscript     n  1        1    n    n  1       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}     simplifies as        ∑   n  =  1   ∞      1   n   (   n  +  1   )          superscript   subscript     n  1        1    n    n  1       \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}     In general  Let    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   be a sequence of numbers. Then,         ∑   n  =  1   N    (    a  n   -   a   n  -  1     )    =    a  N   -   a  0     ,        superscript   subscript     n  1    N      subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1         subscript  a  N    subscript  a  0      \sum_{n=1}^{N}\left(a_{n}-a_{n-1}\right)=a_{N}-a_{0},     and, if     a  n   →  0     normal-→   subscript  a  n   0    a_{n}\rightarrow 0            ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (    a  n   -   a   n  -  1     )    =   -   a  0     .        superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1         subscript  a  0      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\left(a_{n}-a_{n-1}\right)=-a_{0}.     A pitfall  Although telescoping can be a useful technique, there are pitfalls to watch out for:      0  =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞   0   =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (   1  -  1   )    =   1  +    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    (    -  1   +  1   )     =   1         0    superscript   subscript     n  1      0          superscript   subscript     n  1        1  1           1    superscript   subscript     n  1          1   1          1     0=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}0=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(1-1)=1+\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1+1)=1\,     is not correct because this regrouping of terms is invalid unless the individual terms converge to 0; see Grandi's series . The way to avoid this error is to find the sum of the first N terms first and then take the limit as N approaches infinity:        ∑   n  =  1   N      1   n   (   n  +  1   )          superscript   subscript     n  1    N     1    n    n  1       \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{N}\frac{1}{n(n+1)}     More examples   Many trigonometric functions also admit representation as a difference, which allows telescopic cancelling between the consecutive terms.          \begin{align} \sum_{n=1}^N \sin\left(n\right) & {} = \sum_{n=1}^N \frac{1}{2} \csc\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(2\sin\left(\frac{1}{2}\right)\sin\left(n\right)\right) \\ & {} =\frac{1}{2} \csc\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \sum_{n=1}^N \left(\cos\left(\frac{2n-1}{2}\right) -\cos\left(\frac{2n+1}{2}\right)\right) \\ & {} =\frac{1}{2} \csc\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) \left(\cos\left(\frac{1}{2}\right) -\cos\left(\frac{2N+1}{2}\right)\right). \end{align}   Some sums of the form           ∑   n  =  1   N     f   (  n  )     g   (  n  )      ,      superscript   subscript     n  1    N       f  n     g  n      \sum_{n=1}^{N}{f(n)\over g(n)},         where f and g are polynomial functions whose quotient may be broken up into partial fractions , will fail to admit summation by this method. In particular, we have          \begin{align} \sum^\infty_{n=0}\frac{2n+3}{(n+1)(n+2)} & {} =\sum^\infty_{n=0}\left(\frac{1}{n+1}+\frac{1}{n+2}\right) \\ & {} = \left(\frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4}\right) + \cdots \\ & {} \cdots + \left(\frac{1}{n-1} + \frac{1}{n}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n} + \frac{1}{n+1}\right) + \left(\frac{1}{n+1} + \frac{1}{n+2}\right) + \cdots \\ & {} =\infty. \end{align}   The problem is that the terms do not cancel.    Let k be a positive integer. Then           ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1   n   (   n  +  k   )      =    H  k   k         subscript   superscript       n  1      1    n    n  k         subscript  H  k   k     \sum^{\infty}_{n=1}{\frac{1}{n(n+k)}}=\frac{H_{k}}{k}         where H k is the k th harmonic number . All of the terms after 1/( k − 1) cancel.   An application in probability theory  In probability theory , a Poisson process is a stochastic process of which the simplest case involves "occurrences" at random times, the waiting time until the next occurrence having a memoryless  exponential distribution , and the number of "occurrences" in any time interval having a Poisson distribution whose expected value is proportional to the length of the time interval. Let X t be the number of "occurrences" before time t , and let T x be the waiting time until the x th "occurrence". We seek the probability density function of the random variable  T x . We use the probability mass function for the Poisson distribution, which tells us that        Pr   (    X  t   =  x   )    =      (   λ  t   )   x    e   -   λ  t       x  !     ,       Pr     subscript  X  t   x         superscript    λ  t   x    superscript  e      λ  t        x      \Pr(X_{t}=x)=\frac{(\lambda t)^{x}e^{-\lambda t}}{x!},     where λ is the average number of occurrences in any time interval of length 1. Observe that the event { X t ≥ x} is the same as the event { T x ≤ t }, and thus they have the same probability. The density function we seek is therefore      f   (  t  )       f  t    \displaystyle f(t)     The sum telescopes, leaving        f   (  t  )    =     λ  x    t   x  -  1     e   -   λ  t        (   x  -  1   )   !     .        f  t        superscript  λ  x    superscript  t    x  1     superscript  e      λ  t          x  1       f(t)=\frac{\lambda^{x}t^{x-1}e^{-\lambda t}}{(x-1)!}.
