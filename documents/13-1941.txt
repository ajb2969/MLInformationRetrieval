   Veneziano amplitude      Veneziano amplitude   In theoretical physics , the Veneziano amplitude refers to the discovery made in 1968 by Italian theoretical physicist Gabriele Veneziano that the Euler gamma function , when interpreted as a scattering amplitude , has many of the features needed to explain the physical properties of strongly interacting  mesons , such as symmetry and duality. 1  Conformal symmetry was soon discovered. The formula is the following:       Γ   (    -  1   +    1  2     (    k  1   +   k  2    )   2     )   Γ   (    -  1   +    1  2     (    k  2   +   k  3    )   2     )     Γ   (    -  2   +    1  2    (     (    k  1   +   k  2    )   2   +    (    k  2   +   k  3    )   2    )     )          normal-Γ      1       1  2    superscript     subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2    2     normal-Γ      1       1  2    superscript     subscript  k  2    subscript  k  3    2        normal-Γ      2       1  2      superscript     subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2    2    superscript     subscript  k  2    subscript  k  3    2         \frac{\Gamma(-1+\frac{1}{2}(k_{1}+k_{2})^{2})\Gamma(-1+\frac{1}{2}(k_{2}+k_{3}%
 )^{2})}{\Gamma(-2+\frac{1}{2}((k_{1}+k_{2})^{2}+(k_{2}+k_{3})^{2}))}   .  k n is a vector (such as a four-vector ) referring to the momentum of the n th particle. Γ is the gamma function .  This discovery can be considered the birth of string theory , 2 as the discovery and invention of string theory came about as a search for a physical model which would give rise to such a scattering amplitude.
