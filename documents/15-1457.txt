Beta-D-galactosyl-(1-4)-L-rhamnose phosphorylase

Beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-L-rhamnose phosphorylase (, D-galactosyl-beta1->4-L-rhamnose phosphorylase, GalRhaP) is an enzyme with system name beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-L-rhamnose:phosphate 1-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

beta-D-galactosyl-(1->4)-L-rhamnose + phosphate

 
  L-rhamnose + alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate
 

The enzyme from Clostridium phytofermentans is also active towards beta-D-galactosyl derivatives of L-mannose, L-lyxose, D-glucose, 2-deoxy-D-glucose, and D-galactose.
