   Glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase      Glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase   In enzymology , a glutamate-1-semialdehyde 2,1-aminomutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamate 1-semialdehyde   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-aminolevulinate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , L-glutamate-1-semialdehyde , and one product , 5-aminolevulinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring amino groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-4-amino-5-oxopentanoate 4,5-aminomutase . This enzyme is also called glutamate-1-semialdehyde aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll biosynthesis. It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 10 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , and .
