   Wronskian      Wronskian   In mathematics , the Wronskian (or Wrońskian ) is a determinant introduced by  and named by . It is used in the study of differential equations , where it can sometimes show linear independence in a set of solutions.  Definition  The Wronskian of two differentiable functions   f   f   f   and   g   g   g   is     W   (  f  ,  g  )    =   f   g  ′  –  g   f  ′         W   f  g      f  normal-  g  normal-′  normal-–  g  normal-  f  normal-′     W(f,g)=f g′–g f′   .  More generally, for   n   n   n    real - or complex -valued functions , which are    n  –  1      n  normal-–  1    n–1   times differentiable on an interval    I   I   I   , the Wronskian as a function on   I   I   I   is defined by         W   (   f  1   ,  …  ,   f  n   )    (  x  )    =   |       f  1    (  x  )        f  2    (  x  )      ⋯      f  n    (  x  )          f  1  ′    (  x  )        f  2  ′    (  x  )      ⋯      f  n  ′    (  x  )        ⋮    ⋮    ⋱    ⋮        f  1   (   n  -  1   )     (  x  )        f  2   (   n  -  1   )     (  x  )      ⋯      f  n   (   n  -  1   )     (  x  )       |    ,   x  ∈  I    .     formulae-sequence      W    subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f  n    x          subscript  f  1   x      subscript  f  2   x   normal-⋯     subscript  f  n   x        superscript   subscript  f  1   normal-′   x      superscript   subscript  f  2   normal-′   x   normal-⋯     superscript   subscript  f  n   normal-′   x     normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋱  normal-⋮       superscript   subscript  f  1     n  1    x      superscript   subscript  f  2     n  1    x   normal-⋯     superscript   subscript  f  n     n  1    x         x  I     W(f_{1},\ldots,f_{n})(x)=\begin{vmatrix}f_{1}(x)&f_{2}(x)&\cdots&f_{n}(x)\\

 \in I.     That is, it is the determinant of the matrix constructed by placing the functions in the first row, the first derivative of each function in the second row, and so on through the    (   n  –  1   )      n  normal-–  1    (n–1)   th derivative, thus forming a square matrix sometimes called a fundamental matrix .  When the functions are solutions of a linear differential equation , the Wronskian can be found explicitly using Abel's identity , even if the functions are not known explicitly.  The Wronskian and linear independence  If the functions are linearly dependent, then so are the columns of the Wronskian as differentiation is a linear operation, so the Wronskian vanishes. Thus, the Wronskian can be used to show that a set of differentiable functions is linearly independent on an interval by showing that it does not vanish identically.  A common misconception is that    W  =  0      W  0    W=0   everywhere implies linear dependence, but  pointed out that the functions and     |  x  |   x        x   x    |x|x   have continuous derivatives and their Wronskian vanishes everywhere, yet they are not linearly dependent in any neighborhood of   0   0    . There are several extra conditions which ensure that the vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval implies linear dependence.  observed that if the functions are analytic, then the vanishing of the Wronskian in an interval implies that they are linearly dependent.  gave several other conditions for the vanishing of the Wronskian to imply linear dependence; for example, if the Wronskian of   n   n   n   functions is identically zero and the   n   n   n   Wronskians of    n  –  1      n  normal-–  1    n–1   of them do not all vanish at any point then the functions are linearly dependent.  gave a more general condition that together with the vanishing of the Wronskian implies linear dependence.  Generalized Wronskians  For   n   n   n   functions of several variables, a generalized Wronskian is the determinant of an   n   n   n   by   n   n   n   matrix with entries (with   i   i   i     See also   Moore matrix , analogous to the Wronskian with differentiation replaced by the Frobenius endomorphism over a finite field.
