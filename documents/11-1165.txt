   Polynomial Diophantine equation      Polynomial Diophantine equation   In mathematics , a polynomial Diophantine equation is an indeterminate  polynomial  equation for which one seeks solutions restricted to be polynomials in the indeterminate. A Diophantine equation , in general, is one where the solutions are restricted to some algebraic system, typically integers. (In another usage ) Diophantine refers to the Hellenistic mathematician of the 3rd century, Diophantus of Alexandria , who made initial studies of integer Diophantine equations.  An important type of polynomial Diophantine equations takes the form:        s  a   +   t  b    =  c          s  a     t  b    c    sa+tb=c     where a , b , and c are known polynomials, and we wish to solve for s and t .  A simple example (and a solution) is:        s   (    x  2   +  1   )    +   t   (    x  3   +  1   )     =   2  x           s     superscript  x  2   1      t     superscript  x  3   1       2  x     s(x^{2}+1)+t(x^{3}+1)=2x         s  =     -   x  3    -   x  2    +  x       s         superscript  x  3     superscript  x  2    x     s=-x^{3}-x^{2}+x          t  =    x  2   +  x    .      t     superscript  x  2   x     t=x^{2}+x.     A necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial Diophantine equation to have a solution is for c to be a multiple of the GCD of a and b . In the example above, the GCD of a and b was 1, so solutions would exist for any value of c.  Solutions to polynomial Diophantine equations are not unique. Any multiple of    a  b      a  b    ab   (say    r  a  b      r  a  b    rab   ) can be used to transform   s   s   s   and   t   t   t   into another solution     s  ′   =   s  +   r  b         superscript  s  normal-′     s    r  b      s^{\prime}=s+rb        t  ′   =   t  -   r  a         superscript  t  normal-′     t    r  a      t^{\prime}=t-ra   :          (   s  +   r  b    )   a   +    (   t  -   r  a    )   b    =  c   .            s    r  b    a       t    r  a    b    c    (s+rb)a+(t-ra)b=c.     Some polynomial Diophantine equations can be solved using the extended Euclidean algorithm , which works as well with polynomials as it does with integers.  References     "  Category:Algebra
