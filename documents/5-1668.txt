   Goppa code      Goppa code   In mathematics , an algebraic geometric code ( AG-code ), otherwise known as a Goppa code , is a general type of linear code constructed by using an algebraic curve    X   X   X   over a finite field     𝔽  q     subscript  𝔽  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   . Such codes were introduced by Valerii Denisovich Goppa . In particular cases, they can have interesting extremal properties . They should not be confused with Binary Goppa codes that are used, for instance, in the McEliece cryptosystem .  Construction  Traditionally, an AG-code is constructed from a non-singular  projective curve  X over a finite field    𝔽  q     subscript  𝔽  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   by using a number of fixed distinct    𝔽  q     subscript  𝔽  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   - rational points     𝒫   𝒫   \mathcal{P}   := { P 1 , P 2 , ..., P n } ⊂ X (    𝔽  q     subscript  𝔽  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   ) on X .  Let G be a divisor on X , with a support that consists of only rational points and that is disjoint from the    P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   's. Thus   𝒫   𝒫   \mathcal{P}   ∩ supp( G ) = Ø  By the Riemann-Roch theorem, there is a unique finite-dimensional vector space,    L   (  G  )       L  G    L(G)   , with respect to the divisor G . The vector space is a subspace of the function field of X .  There are two main types of AG-codes that can be constructed using the above information.  Function code  The function code (or dual code) with respect to a curve X , a divisor G and the set   𝒫   𝒫   \mathcal{P}   is constructed as follows. Let    D  =    P  1   +   P  2   +  ⋯  +   P  n        D     subscript  P  1    subscript  P  2   normal-⋯   subscript  P  n      D=P_{1}+P_{2}+\cdots+P_{n}   , be a divisor, with the     P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}    defined as above. We usually denote a Goppa code by C ( D , G ). We now know all we need to define the Goppa code: : C ( D , G ) = {( f ( P 1 ), ..., f ( P n ))| f    ∈     \in    L ( G )}⊂    𝔽  q  n     superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   For a fixed basis   f 1 , f 2 , ..., f k    for L ( G ) over    𝔽  q     subscript  𝔽  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   , the corresponding Goppa code in    𝔽  q  n     superscript   subscript  𝔽  q   n    \mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}   is spanned over    𝔽  q     subscript  𝔽  q    \mathbb{F}_{q}   by the vectors   ( f i ( P 1 ), f i ( P 2 ), ..., f i ( P n )).   Therefore      [       f  1    (   P  1   )      …      f  1    (   P  n   )        …    …    …        f  k    (   P  1   )      …      f  k    (   P  n   )       ]         subscript  f  1    subscript  P  1    normal-…     subscript  f  1    subscript  P  n      normal-…  normal-…  normal-…       subscript  f  k    subscript  P  1    normal-…     subscript  f  k    subscript  P  n       \begin{bmatrix}f_{1}(P_{1})&...&f_{1}(P_{n})\\
 ...&...&...\\
 f_{k}(P_{1})&...&f_{k}(P_{n})\end{bmatrix}     is a generator matrix for C ( D , G )  Equivalently, it is defined as the image of      α  :    L   (  G  )    ⟶   𝔽  n       normal-:  α   normal-⟶    L  G    superscript  𝔽  n      \alpha:L(G)\longrightarrow\mathbb{F}^{n}   ,  where f is defined by    f  ⟼   (   f   (   P  1   )    ,  …  ,   f   (   P  n   )    )      normal-⟼  f     f   subscript  P  1    normal-…    f   subscript  P  n       f\longmapsto(f(P_{1}),\dots,f(P_{n}))   .  The following shows how the parameters of the code relate to classical parameters of linear systems of divisors  D on C (cf. Riemann–Roch theorem for more). The notation l ( D ) means the dimension of L ( D ).  Proposition A The dimension of the Goppa code C ( D , G ) is      k  =    l   (  G  )    -   l   (   G  -  D   )         k      l  G     l    G  D       k=l(G)-l(G-D)   ,  Proposition B The minimal distance between two code words is      d  ≥   n  -   deg   (  G  )         d    n   degree  G      d\geq n-\deg(G)   .  Proof A  Since        C   (  D  ,  G  )    ≅    L   (  G  )    /   ker   (  α  )      ,        C   D  G        L  G    kernel  α      C(D,G)\cong L(G)/\ker(\alpha),     we must show that       ker   (  α  )    =   L   (   G  -  D   )         kernel  α     L    G  D      \ker(\alpha)=L(G-D)   .  Suppose    f  ∈   ker   (  α  )        f   kernel  α     f\in\ker(\alpha)   . Then      f   (   P  i   )    =  0   ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence      f   subscript  P  i    0     i   1  normal-…  n      f(P_{i})=0,i=1,\dots,n   , so     div   (  f  )    >  D        div  f   D    \mathrm{div}(f)>D   . Thus,    f  ∈   L   (   G  -  D   )        f    L    G  D      f\in L(G-D)   . Conversely, suppose    f  ∈   L   (   G  -  D   )        f    L    G  D      f\in L(G-D)   . Then       div   (  f  )    >  D        div  f   D    \mathrm{div}(f)>D     since        P  i   <  G   ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence     subscript  P  i   G     i   1  normal-…  n      P_{i}   .  ( G doesn't “fix” the problems with the    -  D      D    -D   , so f must do that instead.) It follows that        f   (   P  i   )    =  0   ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence      f   subscript  P  i    0     i   1  normal-…  n      f(P_{i})=0,i=1,\dots,n   . Proof B To show that    d  ≥   n  -   deg   (  G  )         d    n   degree  G      d\geq n-\deg(G)   , suppose the Hamming weight of    α   (  f  )       α  f    \alpha(f)   is d . That means that     f   (   P  i   )    =  0        f   subscript  P  i    0    f(P_{i})=0   for    n  -  d      n  d    n-d       P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   s, say     P   i  1    ,  …  ,   P   i   n  -  d         subscript  P   subscript  i  1    normal-…   subscript  P   subscript  i    n  d       P_{i_{1}},\dots,P_{i_{n-d}}   . Then    f  ∈   L   (   G  -   P   i  1    -  …  -   P   i   n  -  d      )        f    L    G   subscript  P   subscript  i  1    normal-…   subscript  P   subscript  i    n  d         f\in L(G-P_{i_{1}}-\dots-P_{i_{n-d}})   , and         div   (  f  )    +  G   -   P   i  1    -  …  -   P   i   n  -  d      >  0            div  f   G    subscript  P   subscript  i  1    normal-…   subscript  P   subscript  i    n  d      0    \mathrm{div}(f)+G-P_{i_{1}}-\dots-P_{i_{n-d}}>0   .  Taking degrees on both sides and noting that       deg   (   div   (  f  )    )    =  0       degree    div  f    0    \deg(\mathrm{div}(f))=0   ,  we get        deg   (  G  )    -   (   n  -  d   )    ≥  0         degree  G     n  d    0    \deg(G)-(n-d)\geq 0   ,  so      d  ≥   n  -   deg   (  G  )         d    n   degree  G      d\geq n-\deg(G)   . Q.E.D.  Residue code  The residue code can be defined as the dual of the function code, or as the residue of some functions at the    P  i     subscript  P  i    P_{i}   's.
