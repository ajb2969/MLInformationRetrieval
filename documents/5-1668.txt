Goppa code

In mathematics, an algebraic geometric code (AG-code), otherwise known as a Goppa code, is a general type of linear code constructed by using an algebraic curve

 
  over a finite field

 
 . Such codes were introduced by Valerii Denisovich Goppa. In particular cases, they can have interesting extremal properties. They should not be confused with Binary Goppa codes that are used, for instance, in the McEliece cryptosystem.
Construction
Traditionally, an AG-code is constructed from a non-singular projective curve X over a finite field 
 
 
 
  by using a number of fixed distinct 
 
 
 
  -rational points


 
 := {P1, P2, ..., Pn} ⊂ X ( 
 
 
 
 ) on X.
Let G be a divisor on X, with a support that consists of only rational points and that is disjoint from the 
 
 
 
 's. Thus 
 
 
 
  ∩ supp(G) = Ø
By the Riemann-Roch theorem, there is a unique finite-dimensional vector space, 
 
 
 
 , with respect to the divisor G. The vector space is a subspace of the function field of X.
There are two main types of AG-codes that can be constructed using the above information.
Function code
The function code (or dual code) with respect to a curve X, a divisor G and the set 
 
 
 
  is constructed as follows.
 Let 
 
 
 
 , be a divisor, with the 

 defined as above. We usually denote a Goppa code by C(D,G). We now know all we need to define the Goppa code:
 :C(D,G) = {(f(P1), ..., f(Pn))|f

L(G)}⊂
 
 
 
  For a fixed basis

f1, f2, ..., fk


for L(G) over 
 
 
 
 , the corresponding Goppa code in 
 
 
 
  is spanned over 
 
 
 
  by the vectors

(fi(P1), fi(P2), ..., fi(Pn)).
 

Therefore



is a generator matrix for C(D,G)
Equivalently, it is defined as the image of


 
 ,
where f is defined by 
 
 
 
 .
The following shows how the parameters of the code relate to classical parameters of linear systems of divisors D on C (cf. Riemann–Roch theorem for more). The notation l(D) means the dimension of L(D).
Proposition A The dimension of the Goppa code C(D,G) is


 
 ,
Proposition B The minimal distance between two code words is


 
 .
Proof A
Since



we must show that


 
 .
Suppose 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 . Thus, 
 
 
 
 .
  Conversely, suppose 
 
 
 
 .
  Then



since


 
 .
(G doesn't “fix” the problems with the 
 
 
 
 , so f must do that instead.) It follows that


 
 . Proof B
 To show that 
 
 
 
 , suppose the Hamming weight of 
 
 
 
  is d. That means that 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 

 
 s, say 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 , and


 
 .
Taking degrees on both sides and noting that


 
 ,
we get


 
 ,
so


 
 . Q.E.D.
Residue code
The residue code can be defined as the dual of the function code, or as the residue of some functions at the 
 
 
 
 's.
