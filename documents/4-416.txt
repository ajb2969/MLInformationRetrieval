   Clifford module      Clifford module   In mathematics , a Clifford module is a representation of a Clifford algebra . In general a Clifford algebra C is a central simple algebra over some field extension  L of the field K over which the quadratic form  Q defining C is defined.  The abstract theory of Clifford modules was founded by a paper of M. F. Atiyah , R. Bott and Arnold S. Shapiro . A fundamental result on Clifford modules is that the Morita equivalence class of a Clifford algebra (the equivalence class of the category of Clifford modules over it) depends only on the signature . This is an algebraic form of Bott periodicity .  Matrix representations of real Clifford algebras  We will need to study anticommuting  matrices ( AB = − BA ) because in Clifford algebras orthogonal vectors anticommute       A  ⋅  B   =    1  2    (    A  B   +   B  A    )    =  0.         normal-⋅  A  B       1  2       A  B     B  A          0.     A\cdot B=\frac{1}{2}(AB+BA)=0.     For the real Clifford algebra     ℝ   p  ,  q       subscript  ℝ   p  q     \mathbb{R}_{p,q}\,   , we need p + q mutually anticommuting matrices, of which p have +1 as square and q have −1 as square.         γ  a  2     =     +  1     if     1  ≤  a  ≤  p        γ  a  2     =     -  1     if      p  ;   +  1    ≤  a  ≤   p  +  q          γ  a    γ  b      =     -    γ  b    γ  a       if     a  ;  ≠  b  .          superscript   subscript  γ  a   2      1   if      1  a       p       superscript   subscript  γ  a   2      1   if       p    1    a         p  q          subscript  γ  a    subscript  γ  b          subscript  γ  b    subscript  γ  a     if   fragments  a  normal-;   b  normal-.      \begin{matrix}\gamma_{a}^{2}&=&+1&\mbox{if}&1\leq a\leq p\\
 \gamma_{a}^{2}&=&-1&\mbox{if}&p+1\leq a\leq p+q\\
 \gamma_{a}\gamma_{b}&=&-\gamma_{b}\gamma_{a}&\mbox{if}&a\neq b.\\
 \end{matrix}     Such a basis of gamma matrices is not unique. One can always obtain another set of gamma matrices satisfying the same Clifford algebra by means of a similarity transformation.         γ   a  ′      =    S     γ  a      S   ;   -  1            subscript  γ   superscript  a  normal-′     S   subscript  γ  a    fragments  S   superscript  normal-;    1        \begin{matrix}\gamma_{a^{\prime}}&=&S&\gamma_{a}&S^{-1}\end{matrix}     where S is a non-singular matrix. The sets γ a' and γ a belong to the same equivalence class.  Real Clifford algebra R 3,1  Developed by Ettore Majorana , this Clifford module enables the construction of a Dirac-like equation without complex numbers, and its elements are called Majorana spinors .  The four basis vectors are the three Pauli matrices and a fourth antihermitian matrix. The signature is (+++−). For the signatures (+−−−) and (−−−+) often used in physics, 4×4 complex matrices or 8×8 real matrices are needed.
