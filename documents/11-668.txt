   Agmatine deiminase      Agmatine deiminase   In enzymology , an agmatine deiminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   agmatine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-carbamoylputrescine + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are agmatine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are N-carbamoylputrescine and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is agmatine iminohydrolase . This enzyme is also called agmatine amidinohydrolase . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
