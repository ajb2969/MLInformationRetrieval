Template:Turbulence and Heat Flux modeling for Turbomachinery Flows

Turbo-machinery flows are mostly Turbulent,although flow in the leading edge of the blade lie in laminar and transitional regions.Different aerodynamic and thermodynamic performance of Turbo-machines are influenced by turbulence. To apply computational techniques in turbomachinery flows ,it is necessary to model turbulence and heat flux .
Turbulence Modeling
Flow in Turbomachines are mostly three dimensional and Turbulent.Turbulence model mostly used are based on simple and mildly complex shear layer.Simple shear layer flow is the one where the gradient normal to wall in 2D case is given by 
 
 
 
 ,but in case of turbomachinery the flow is complex .Complex flow are subjected to significant extra strain rate and these complex flow cause turbulence structure modification.Examples of complex shear layer in turbomachinery includes :

Shear layer on rotating surfaces : Additional strains are introduced due to three dimensional boundary layer and wake on the surface.
Shear layer developing on curved surfaces :
