   (cytochrome c)-methionine S-methyltransferase      (cytochrome c)-methionine S-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a [cytochrome-c]-methionine S-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + [cytochrome c]-methionine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + [cytochrome c]-S-methyl-methionine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and cytochrome c  methionine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and cytochrome c - S-methyl-methionine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[cytochrome c]-methionine S-methyltransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
