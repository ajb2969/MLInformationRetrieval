   Smearing retransformation      Smearing retransformation   The Smearing retransformation is used in regression analysis , after estimating the logarithm of a variable. Estimating the logarithm of a variable instead of the variable itself is a common technique to more closely approximate normality . In order to retransform the variable back to level from log, the Smearing retransformation is used.  If the log-transformed variable y is estimated as:       log   (  y  )    =    f   (  X  )    +  er         y       f  X   er     \log(y)=f(X)+\mathrm{er}     then, the level variable is given by:       y  =    exp   (   f   (  X  )    )     exp   (  er  )      .      y        f  X      er      y=\exp(f(X))\exp(\mathrm{er}).
