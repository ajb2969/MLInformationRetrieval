   (Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase)-lysine N-methyltransferase      (Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase)-lysine N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a [ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase]-lysine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + [ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase]-lysine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + [ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase]-N 6 -methyl-L-lysine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase - lysine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase - N6-methyl-L-lysine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[3-phospho-D-glycerate-carboxy-lyase (dimerizing)]-lysine N6-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include rubisco methyltransferase , ribulose-bisphosphate-carboxylase/oxygenase N-methyltransferase , ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase large subunit , epsilonN-methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:[3-phospho-D-glycerate-carboxy-lyase , and (dimerizing)]-lysine 6-N-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
