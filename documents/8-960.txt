   KSE BRIndex30      KSE BRIndex30   BRIndex30 or BR Index 30 is a turnover based index for Karachi Stock Exchange developed by Business Recorder . BR in BRIndex30 stands for ( Business Recorder ) and number 30 indicates the number of companies covered by the index. Composition of BRIndex30 is based on average turnover of past 6 months trading days. Companies' stocks are included (or removed) based on the largest average turnover recorded in the last six months.  Selection Criteria  Companies are selected on the basis of turnover and trading frequency.  Turnover  BRIndex30 is a turnover based index and the average turnover of the scrip in the last six months is the primary criteria for scrip selection. First 30 scrips having the largest average turnover for the last six months will be considered for the inclusion in the BRIndex30 given that they also meet the criteria for trading frequency.  Trading Frequency  It is necessary for a scrip to be traded on each and every trading day of the last 1 year; besides fulfilling the turnover criteria, to get included in the BRIndex30. (Exceptions can be made for extreme reasons, and the review committee would finally decide it).  Calculation  BRIndex30 is calculated using a “Market Capitalization Weighted” methodology. As per this methodology the level of index at any point of time reflects the total market value of 30 component stocks relative to a base period. The formula for calculating BRIndex30 is:      Index Level  =     ∑   (    P  i   ⋅   Q  i    )     D  i  v  i  s  o  r    ×  5000       Index Level         normal-⋅   subscript  P  i    subscript  Q  i       D  i  v  i  s  o  r    5000     \text{Index Level}={\sum\left({P_{i}}\cdot{Q_{i}}\right)\over Divisor}{\times 5%
 000}   where P is the price of each stock in the index and Q is the number of CDC shares publicly available for each stock.  The divisor is adjusted in the case of price change due to cash dividend, stock dividend, right shares issue or stock splits to ensure that such events do not in themselves alter the numerical value of the Index.  Revision Frequency  BRIndex30 company composition is revised every six months while CDC shares of companies are revised every 3 months to reflect precise market situation.
