Harmonic spectrum

A harmonic spectrum is a spectrum containing only frequency components whose frequencies are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency; such frequencies are known as harmonics.
In other words, if 
 
 
 
  is the fundamental frequency, then a harmonic spectrum has the form



A standard result of Fourier analysis is that a function has a harmonic spectrum if and only if it is periodic.
