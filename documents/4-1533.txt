   Harmonic spectrum      Harmonic spectrum   A harmonic spectrum is a spectrum containing only frequency components whose frequencies are whole number multiples of the fundamental frequency ; such frequencies are known as harmonics .  In other words, if    ω    ω   \omega\,   is the fundamental frequency, then a harmonic spectrum has the form       {  …  ,   -   2  ω    ,   -  ω   ,  0  ,  ω  ,   2  ω   ,  …  }   .     normal-…      2  ω      ω   0  ω    2  ω   normal-…    \{\dots,-2\omega,-\omega,0,\omega,2\omega,\dots\}.     A standard result of Fourier analysis is that a function has a harmonic spectrum if and only if it is periodic .
