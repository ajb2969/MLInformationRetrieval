Riemannian submersion

In differential geometry, a branch of mathematics, a Riemannian submersion is a submersion from one Riemannian manifold to another that respects the metrics, meaning that it is an orthogonal projection on tangent spaces.
Let (M, g) and (N, h) be two Riemannian manifolds and


 
  a submersion.
Then f is a Riemannian submersion if and only if the isomorphism


 
  is an isometry.
Examples
An example of a Riemannian submersion arises when a Lie group

 
  acts isometrically, freely and properly on a Riemannian manifold 
 
 
 
 
 . The projection 
 
 
 
  to the quotient space

 
  equipped with the quotient metric is a Riemannian submersion. For example, component-wise multiplication on 
 
 
 
  by the group of unit complex numbers yields the Hopf fibration.
Properties
The sectional curvature of the target space of a Riemannian submersion can be calculated from the curvature of the total space by O'Neill's formula:


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  are orthonormal vector fields on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  their horizontal lifts to 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the Lie bracket of vector fields and 
 
 
 
 
  is the projection of the vector field 
 
 
 
  to the vertical distribution.
In particular the lower bound for the sectional curvature of 
 
 
 
  is at least as big as the lower bound for the sectional curvature of 
 
 
 
 .
