   Riemannian submersion      Riemannian submersion   In differential geometry , a branch of mathematics , a Riemannian submersion is a submersion from one Riemannian manifold to another that respects the metrics, meaning that it is an orthogonal projection on tangent spaces.  Let ( M , g ) and ( N , h ) be two Riemannian manifolds and      f  :   M  →  N      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  N     f:M\to N   a submersion.  Then f is a Riemannian submersion if and only if the isomorphism       d  f   :    ker    (   d  f   )   ⟂    →   T  N       normal-:    d  f    normal-→    ker   superscript    d  f   perpendicular-to      T  N      df:\mathrm{ker}(df)^{\perp}\rightarrow TN   is an isometry .  Examples  An example of a Riemannian submersion arises when a Lie group    G   G   G   acts isometrically, freely and properly on a Riemannian manifold    (  M  ,  g  )     M  g    (M,g)   . The projection    π  :   M  →  N      normal-:  π   normal-→  M  N     \pi:M\rightarrow N   to the quotient space     N  =   M  /  G       N    M  G     N=M/G   equipped with the quotient metric is a Riemannian submersion. For example, component-wise multiplication on     S  3   ⊂   ℂ  2        superscript  S  3    superscript  ℂ  2     S^{3}\subset\mathbb{C}^{2}   by the group of unit complex numbers yields the Hopf fibration .  Properties  The sectional curvature of the target space of a Riemannian submersion can be calculated from the curvature of the total space by O'Neill's formula :        K  N    (  X  ,  Y  )    =     K  M    (   X  ~   ,   Y  ~   )    +     3  4      |    [   X  ~   ,   Y  ~   ]   V   |   2            subscript  K  N    X  Y         subscript  K  M     normal-~  X    normal-~  Y         3  4    superscript     superscript    normal-~  X    normal-~  Y    V    2       K_{N}(X,Y)=K_{M}(\tilde{X},\tilde{Y})+\tfrac{3}{4}|[\tilde{X},\tilde{Y}]^{V}|^%

In particular the lower bound for the sectional curvature of   N   N   N   is at least as big as the lower bound for the sectional curvature of   M   M   M   .
