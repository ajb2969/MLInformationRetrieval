   Alternating series test      Alternating series test   In mathematical analysis , the alternating series test is a method used to prove that an alternating series with terms that decrease in absolute value is a convergent series . The test was used by Gottfried Leibniz and is sometimes known as Leibniz's test , Leibniz's rule , or the Leibniz criterion .  Formulation  A series of the form        ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )    n  -  1     a  n     =      a  1   -   a  2    +   a  3    -   ⋯          superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1     subscript  a  n            subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2     subscript  a  3    normal-⋯     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}=a_{1}-a_{2}+a_{3}-\cdots\!     Or,        ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )   n    a  n     =      -   a  1    +   a  2    -   a  3    +   ⋯          superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1   n    subscript  a  n              subscript  a  1     subscript  a  2     subscript  a  3    normal-⋯     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}a_{n}=-a_{1}+a_{2}-a_{3}+\cdots\!     where a n are positive, is called an alternating series .  The alternating series test then says: if    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   decreases monotonically and      lim   n  →  ∞     a  n    =  0        subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  a  n    0    \lim_{n\to\infty}a_{n}=0   then the alternating series converges.  Moreover, let L denote the sum of the series, then the partial sum       S  k   =    ∑   n  =  1   k      (   -  1   )    n  -  1      a  n           subscript  S  k     superscript   subscript     n  1    k      superscript    1     n  1     subscript  a  n       S_{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{k}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\!     approximates L with error bounded by the next omitted term:        |    S  k   -  L   |   ≤   |    S  k   -   S   k  +  1     |   =   a   k  +  1     .             subscript  S  k   L         subscript  S  k    subscript  S    k  1            subscript  a    k  1       \left|S_{k}-L\right|\leq\left|S_{k}-S_{k+1}\right|=a_{k+1}.\!     Proof  Suppose we are given a series of the form     ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )    n  -  1      a  n         superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1     n  1     subscript  a  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}\!   , where      lim   n  →  ∞     a  n    =  0        subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  a  n    0    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_{n}=0   and     a  n   ≥   a   n  +  1         subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1      a_{n}\geq a_{n+1}   for all natural numbers n . (The case     ∑   n  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )   n     a  n         superscript   subscript     n  1         superscript    1   n    subscript  a  n      \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{n}a_{n}\!   follows by taking the negative.) 1  Proof of convergence  We will prove that both the partial sums     S    2  m   +  1    =    ∑   n  =  1     2  m   +  1       (   -  1   )    n  -  1     a  n          subscript  S      2  m   1      superscript   subscript     n  1        2  m   1       superscript    1     n  1     subscript  a  n       S_{2m+1}=\sum_{n=1}^{2m+1}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}   with odd number of terms, and     S   2  m    =    ∑   n  =  1    2  m       (   -  1   )    n  -  1     a  n          subscript  S    2  m      superscript   subscript     n  1      2  m       superscript    1     n  1     subscript  a  n       S_{2m}=\sum_{n=1}^{2m}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}   with even number of terms, converge to the same number L . Thus the usual partial sum     S  k   =    ∑   n  =  1   k      (   -  1   )    n  -  1     a  n          subscript  S  k     superscript   subscript     n  1    k      superscript    1     n  1     subscript  a  n       S_{k}=\sum_{n=1}^{k}(-1)^{n-1}a_{n}   also converges to L .  The odd partial sums decrease monotonically:       S    2   (   m  +  1   )    +  1    =     S    2  m   +  1    -   a    2  m   +  2     +   a    2  m   +  3     ≤   S    2  m   +  1           subscript  S      2    m  1    1         subscript  S      2  m   1     subscript  a      2  m   2      subscript  a      2  m   3           subscript  S      2  m   1       S_{2(m+1)+1}=S_{2m+1}-a_{2m+2}+a_{2m+3}\leq S_{2m+1}     while the even partial sums increase monotonically:       S   2   (   m  +  1   )     =     S   2  m    +   a    2  m   +  1     -   a    2  m   +  2     ≥   S   2  m           subscript  S    2    m  1          subscript  S    2  m     subscript  a      2  m   1      subscript  a      2  m   2           subscript  S    2  m       S_{2(m+1)}=S_{2m}+a_{2m+1}-a_{2m+2}\geq S_{2m}     both because a n decrease monotonically with n .  Moreover, since a n are positive,      S    2  m   +  1    -   S   2  m     =   a    2  m   +  1    ≥  0           subscript  S      2  m   1     subscript  S    2  m      subscript  a      2  m   1         0     S_{2m+1}-S_{2m}=a_{2m+1}\geq 0   . Thus we can collect these facts to form the following suggestive inequality:         a  1   -   a  2    =   S  2   ≤   S   2  m    <   S    2  m   +  1    ≤   S  1   =   a  1    .           subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2     subscript  S  2         subscript  S    2  m          subscript  S      2  m   1          subscript  S  1         subscript  a  1      a_{1}-a_{2}=S_{2}\leq S_{2m}     Now, note that a 1 − a 2 is a lower bound of the monotonically decreasing sequence S 2m+1 , the monotone convergence theorem then implies that this sequence converges as m approaches infinity. Similarly, the sequence of even partial sum converges too.  Finally, they must converge to the same number because         lim   n  →  ∞     S    2  m   +  1     -   S   2  m     =    lim   n  →  ∞     a    2  m   +  1     =  0.            subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  S      2  m   1      subscript  S    2  m       subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  a      2  m   1          0.     \lim_{n\to\infty}S_{2m+1}-S_{2m}=\lim_{n\to\infty}a_{2m+1}=0.     Call the limit L , then the monotone convergence theorem also tells us an extra information that       S   2  m    ≤  L  ≤   S    2  m   +  1           subscript  S    2  m    L        subscript  S      2  m   1       S_{2m}\leq L\leq S_{2m+1}     for any m . This means the partial sums of an alternating series also "alternates" above and below the final limit. More precisely, when there are odd (even) number of terms, i.e. the last term is a plus (minus) term, then the partial sum is above (below) the final limit.  This understanding leads immediately to an error bound of partial sums, shown below.  Proof of partial sum error bound  We would like to show     |    S  k   -  L   |   ≤    a   k  +  1              subscript  S  k   L     subscript  a    k  1      \left|S_{k}-L\right|\leq a_{k+1}\!   by splitting into two cases.  When k = 2m+1, i.e. odd, then       |    S    2  m   +  1    -  L   |   =    S    2  m   +  1    -  L   ≤    S    2  m   +  1    -   S    2  m   +  2     =   a    (    2  m   +  1   )   +  1               subscript  S      2  m   1    L       subscript  S      2  m   1    L           subscript  S      2  m   1     subscript  S      2  m   2           subscript  a        2  m   1   1       \left|S_{2m+1}-L\right|=S_{2m+1}-L\leq S_{2m+1}-S_{2m+2}=a_{(2m+1)+1}     When k = 2m, i.e. even, then       |    S   2  m    -  L   |   =   L  -   S   2  m     ≤    S    2  m   +  1    -   S   2  m     =   a    2  m   +  1               subscript  S    2  m    L      L   subscript  S    2  m             subscript  S      2  m   1     subscript  S    2  m           subscript  a      2  m   1       \left|S_{2m}-L\right|=L-S_{2m}\leq S_{2m+1}-S_{2m}=a_{2m+1}     as desired.  Both cases rely essentially on the last inequality derived in the previous proof.  For an alternative proof using Cauchy's convergence test , see Alternating series .
