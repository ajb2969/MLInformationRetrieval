   Guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol-4-phosphatase      Guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol-4-phosphatase   In enzymology , a guanidinodeoxy-scyllo-inositol-4-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol 4-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol 4-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 1-guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol-4-phosphate 4-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include 1-guanidino-scyllo-inositol 4-phosphatase , and 1-guanidino-1-deoxy-scyllo-inositol-4-P phosphohydrolase .
