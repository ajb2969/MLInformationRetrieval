   G-spectrum      G-spectrum   In algebraic topology, a G-spectrum is a spectrum with an action of a (finite) group.  Let X be a spectrum with an action of a finite group G . The important notion is that of the homotopy fixed point set    X   h  G      superscript  X    h  G     X^{hG}   . There is always        X  G   →   X   h  G     ,     normal-→   superscript  X  G    superscript  X    h  G      X^{G}\to X^{hG},   a map from the fixed point spectrum to a homotopy fixed point spectrum (because, by definition,    X   h  G      superscript  X    h  G     X^{hG}   is the mapping spectrum     F    (   B   G  +    ,  X  )   G       F   superscript     B   subscript  G     X   G     F(BG_{+},X)^{G}   .)  Example    ℤ  /  2      ℤ  2    \mathbb{Z}/2   acts on the complex K -theory KU by taking the conjugate bundle of a complex vector bundle . Then     K   U    h  ℤ   /  2     =   K  O         K   superscript  U      h  ℤ   2       K  O     KU^{h\mathbb{Z}/2}=KO   , the real K -theory.  The cofiber of     X   h  G    →   X   h  G       normal-→   subscript  X    h  G     superscript  X    h  G      X_{hG}\to X^{hG}   is called the Tate spectrum of X .  G -Galois extension in the sense of Rognes  This notion is due to J. Rognes . Let A be an E ∞ -ring with an action of a finite group G and B = A hG its invariant subring. Then B → A (the map of B -algebras in E ∞ -sense) is said to be a G-Galois extension if the natural map       A   ⊗  B   A   →    ∏   g  ∈  G    A      normal-→    subscript  tensor-product  B   A  A     subscript  product    g  G    A     A\otimes_{B}A\to\prod_{g\in G}A   (which generalizes     x  ⊗  y   ↦   (   g   (  x  )   y   )      maps-to   tensor-product  x  y     g  x  y     x\otimes y\mapsto(g(x)y)   in the classical setup) is an equivalence. The extension is faithful if the Bousfield classes of A , B over B are equivalent.  Example: KO → KU is a ℤ./2-Galois extension.
