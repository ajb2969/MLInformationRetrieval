G-spectrum

In algebraic topology, a G-spectrum is a spectrum with an action of a (finite) group.
Let X be a spectrum with an action of a finite group G. The important notion is that of the homotopy fixed point set 
 
 
 
 . There is always


 
  a map from the fixed point spectrum to a homotopy fixed point spectrum (because, by definition, 
 
 
 
  is the mapping spectrum

 
 .)
Example
 
 
 
  acts on the complex K-theory KU by taking the conjugate bundle of a complex vector bundle. Then 
 
 
 
 , the real K-theory.
The cofiber of 
 
 
 
  is called the Tate spectrum of X.
G-Galois extension in the sense of Rognes
This notion is due to J. Rognes . Let A be an E∞-ring with an action of a finite group G and B = AhG its invariant subring. Then B → A (the map of B-algebras in E∞-sense) is said to be a G-Galois extension if the natural map


 
  (which generalizes 
 
 
 
  in the classical setup) is an equivalence. The extension is faithful if the Bousfield classes of A, B over B are equivalent.
Example: KO → KU is a ℤ./2-Galois extension.
