Reach (mathematics)

In mathematics, the reach of a subset of Euclidean space Rn is a real number that roughly describes how curved the boundary of the set is.
Definition
Let X be a subset of Rn. Then reach of X is defined as



Examples
Shapes that have reach infinity:

single point
straight line
full square
any convex set

The graph of ƒ(x) = |x| has reach zero.
A circle of radius r has reach r.
