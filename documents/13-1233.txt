   Reach (mathematics)      Reach (mathematics)   In mathematics, the reach of a subset of Euclidean space  R n is a real number that roughly describes how curved the boundary of the set is.  Definition  Let X be a subset of R n . Then reach of X is defined as        reach   (  X  )    :=   sup   {   r  ∈  ℝ   :    ∀  x   ∈    ℝ  n   ∖   X  with  dist   (  x  ,  X  )     <   r  exists a unique closest point  y   ∈   X  such that  dist   (  x  ,  y  )    =   dist   (  x  ,  X  )     }     .     assign    reach  X    supremum   conditional-set    r  ℝ        for-all  x      superscript  ℝ  n     X  with  dist   x  X            r  exists a unique closest point  y          X  such that  dist   x  y           dist   x  X          \text{reach}(X):=\sup\{r\in\mathbb{R}:\forall x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus X%
