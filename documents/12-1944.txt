   Elliptic divisibility sequence      Elliptic divisibility sequence   In mathematics, an elliptic divisibility sequence (EDS) is a sequence of integers satisfying a nonlinear recursion relation arising from division polynomials on elliptic curves . EDS were first defined, and their arithmetic properties studied, by Morgan Ward 1 in the 1940s. They attracted only sporadic attention until around 2000, when EDS were taken up as a class of nonlinear recurrences that are more amenable to analysis than most such sequences. This tractability is due primarily to the close connection between EDS and elliptic curves. In addition to the intrinsic interest that EDS have within number theory, EDS have applications to other areas of mathematics including logic and cryptography .  Definition  A (nondegenerate) elliptic divisibility sequence (EDS) is a sequence of integers defined recursively by four initial values , , , , with ≠ 0 and with subsequent values determined by the formulas       W    2  n   +  1     W  1  3        subscript  W      2  n   1     superscript   subscript  W  1   3     \displaystyle W_{2n+1}W_{1}^{3}     It can be shown that if divides each of , , and if further divides , then every term in the sequence is an integer.  Divisibility property  An EDS is a divisibility sequence in the sense that      m  ∣  n  ⟹   W  m   ∣   W  n   .     fragments  m  normal-∣  n  normal-⟹   subscript  W  m   normal-∣   subscript  W  n   normal-.    m\mid n\Longrightarrow W_{m}\mid W_{n}.   In particular, every term in an EDS is divisible by , so EDS are frequently normalized to have = 1 by dividing every term by the initial term.  Any three integers , , with divisible by lead to a normalized EDS on setting         W  1   =  1   ,     W  2   =  b   ,     W  3   =  c   ,    W  4   =  d      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  W  1   1    formulae-sequence     subscript  W  2   b    formulae-sequence     subscript  W  3   c      subscript  W  4   d       W_{1}=1,\quad W_{2}=b,\quad W_{3}=c,\quad W_{4}=d.   It is not obvious, but can be proven, that the condition | suffices to ensure that every term in the sequence is an integer.  General recursion  A fundamental property of elliptic divisibility sequences is that they satisfy the general recursion relation          W   n  +  m     W   n  -  m     W  r  2    =      W   n  +  r     W   n  -  r     W  m  2    -    W   m  +  r     W   m  -  r     W  n  2     for all     n  >  m  >  r    .     formulae-sequence       subscript  W    n  m     subscript  W    n  m     superscript   subscript  W  r   2          subscript  W    n  r     subscript  W    n  r     superscript   subscript  W  m   2       subscript  W    m  r     subscript  W    m  r     superscript   subscript  W  n   2     for all        n  m       r      W_{n+m}W_{n-m}W_{r}^{2}=W_{n+r}W_{n-r}W_{m}^{2}-W_{m+r}W_{m-r}W_{n}^{2}\quad%
 \text{for all}\quad n>m>r.   (This formula is often applied with = 1 and = 1.)  Nonsingular EDS  The discriminant of a normalized EDS is the quantity       Δ  =        W  4    W  2  15    -    W  3  3    W  2  12     +   3   W  4  2    W  2  10     -   20   W  4    W  3  3    W  2  7     +   3   W  4  3    W  2  5    +   16   W  3  6    W  2  4    +   8   W  4  2    W  3  3    W  2  2    +   W  4  4     .      normal-Δ             subscript  W  4    superscript   subscript  W  2   15       superscript   subscript  W  3   3    superscript   subscript  W  2   12       3   superscript   subscript  W  4   2    superscript   subscript  W  2   10       20   subscript  W  4    superscript   subscript  W  3   3    superscript   subscript  W  2   7       3   superscript   subscript  W  4   3    superscript   subscript  W  2   5      16   superscript   subscript  W  3   6    superscript   subscript  W  2   4      8   superscript   subscript  W  4   2    superscript   subscript  W  3   3    superscript   subscript  W  2   2     superscript   subscript  W  4   4      \Delta=W_{4}W_{2}^{15}-W_{3}^{3}W_{2}^{12}+3W_{4}^{2}W_{2}^{10}-20W_{4}W_{3}^{%

 {2}+W_{4}^{4}.   An EDS is nonsingular if its discriminant is nonzero.  Examples  A simple example of an EDS is the sequence of natural numbers 1, 2, 3,… . Another interesting example is the sequence 1, 3, 8, 21, 55, 144, 377, 987,… consisting of every other term in the Fibonacci sequence , starting with the second term. However, both of these sequences satisfy a linear recurrence and both are singular EDS. An example of a nonsingular EDS is       1  ,  1  ,   -  1   ,  1  ,  2  ,   -  1   ,   -  3   ,   -  5   ,  7  ,   -  4   ,   -  23   ,  29  ,  59  ,  129   ,     1  1    1   1  2    1     3     5   7    4     23   29  59  129    \displaystyle 1,\,1,\,-1,\,1,\,2,\,-1,\,-3,\,-5,\,7,\,-4,\,-23,\,29,\,59,\,129,     Periodicity of EDS  A sequence is said to be periodic if there is a number so that = for every ≥ 1. If a nondegenerate EDS is periodic, then one of its terms vanishes. The smallest ≥ 1 with = 0 is called the rank of apparition of the EDS. A deep theorem of Mazur  B. Mazur.  Modular curves and the Eisenstein ideal,   Inst.  Hautes  Études  Sci.  Publ.  Math. 47:33–186, 1977.  implies that if the rank of apparition of an EDS is finite, then it satisfies ≤ 10 or = 12.  Elliptic curves and points associated to EDS  Ward proves that associated to any nonsingular EDS ( ) is an elliptic curve / Q and a point ε ( Q ) such that        W  n   =    ψ  n    (  P  )        for all   n   ≥  1.      formulae-sequence     subscript  W  n      subscript  ψ  n   P        for all  n   1.     W_{n}=\psi_{n}(P)\qquad\text{for all}~{}n\geq 1.   Here ψ is the division polynomial of ; the roots of ψ are the nonzero points of order on . There is a complicated formula  This formula is due to Ward. See  the appendix to J. H. Silverman and N. Stephens.  The sign of an elliptic divisibility sequence. J.  Ramanujan  Math.  Soc. , 21(1):1–17, 2006.  for and in terms of , , , and .  There is an alternative definition of EDS that directly uses elliptic curves and yields a sequence which, up to sign, almost satisfies the EDS recursion. This definition starts with an elliptic curve / Q given by a Weierstrass equation and a nontorsion point ε ( Q ). One writes the -coordinates of the multiples of as        x   (   n  P   )    =    A  n    D  n  2        with    gcd   (   A  n   ,   D  n   )     =    1    and    D  n    ≥  1.      formulae-sequence      x    n  P       subscript  A  n    superscript   subscript  D  n   2           with     subscript  A  n    subscript  D  n       1  and   subscript  D  n         1.      x(nP)=\frac{A_{n}}{D_{n}^{2}}\quad\text{with}~{}\gcd(A_{n},D_{n})=1~{}\text{%
 and}~{}D_{n}\geq 1.   Then the sequence ( ) is also called an elliptic divisibility sequence . It is a divisibility sequence, and there exists an integer so that the subsequence ( ± ) ≥ 1 (with an appropriate choice of signs) is an EDS in the earlier sense.  Growth of EDS  Let be a nonsingular EDS that is not periodic. Then the sequence grows quadratic exponentially in the sense that there is a positive constant such that        lim   n  →  ∞      log   |   W  n   |     n  2     =  h  >  0.          subscript    normal-→  n            subscript  W  n      superscript  n  2     h       0.     \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{\log|W_{n}|}{n^{2}}=h>0.   The number is the canonical height of the point on the elliptic curve associated to the EDS.  Primes and primitive divisors in EDS  It is conjectured that a nonsingular EDS contains only finitely many primes 2 However, all but finitely many terms in a nonsingular EDS admit a primitive prime divisor. 3 Thus for all but finitely many , there is a prime such that divides , but does not divide for all . This statement is an analogue of Zsigmondy's theorem .  EDS over finite fields  An EDS over a finite field F , or more generally over any field, is a sequence of elements of that field satisfying the EDS recursion. An EDS over a finite field is always periodic, and thus has a rank of apparition . The period of an EDS over F then has the form , where and satisfy      r  ≤    (   q   +  1  )   2   and  t  ∣  q  -  1.     fragments  r    superscript   fragments  normal-(    q    1  normal-)   2    and   t  normal-∣  q   1.    r\leq\left(\sqrt{q}+1\right)^{2}\quad\text{and}\quad t\mid q-1.   More precisely, there are elements and in F * such that        W    r  i   +  j    =    W  j   ⋅   A   i  j    ⋅   B   j  2         for all   i   ≥    0    and all   j   ≥  1.      formulae-sequence     subscript  W      r  i   j     normal-⋅   subscript  W  j    superscript  A    i  j     superscript  B   superscript  j  2            for all  i     0  and all  j        1.      W_{ri+j}=W_{j}\cdot A^{ij}\cdot B^{j^{2}}\quad\text{for all}~{}i\geq 0~{}\text%
 {and all}~{}j\geq 1.   The values of and are related to the Tate pairing of the point on the associated elliptic curve.
