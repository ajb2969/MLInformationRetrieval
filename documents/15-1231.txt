   Glycine/sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase      Glycine/sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase   Glycine/sarcosine/dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase (, GSDMT , glycine sarcosine dimethylglycine N-methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:glycine(or sarcosine or N,N-dimethylglycine) N-methyltransferase (sarcosine(or N,N-dimethylglycine or betaine)-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   3 S-adenosyl-L-methionine + glycine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3 S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + betaine (overall reaction)  (1a) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + glycine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + sarcosine   (1b) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + sarcosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N,N-dimethylglycine   (1c) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + N,N-dimethylglycine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + betaine   This enzyme from the halophilic methanoarchaeon  Methanohalophilus portucalensis can methylate glycine and all of its intermediates to form the compatible solute betaine .
