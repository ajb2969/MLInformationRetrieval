   P²-irreducible      P²-irreducible   In mathematics , a 3-manifold is P 2 -irreducible if it is irreducible and contains no 2-sided     ℝ   P  2       ℝ   superscript  P  2     \mathbb{R}P^{2}   ( real projective plane ). An orientable manifold is P 2 -irreducible if and only if it is irreducible. 1 Every non-orientable P 2 -irreducible manifold is a Haken manifold . 2  References  "  Category:3-manifolds     . ↩  . ↩
