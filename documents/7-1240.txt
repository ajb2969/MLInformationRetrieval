   Zimm–Bragg model      Zimm–Bragg model   In statistical mechanics , the Zimm –Bragg model is a helix-coil transition model that describes helix-coil transitions of macromolecules , usually polymer chains. Most models provide a reasonable approximation of the fractional helicity of a given polypeptide ; the Zimm–Bragg model differs by incorporating the ease of propagation with respect to nucleation .  Helix-coil transition models  Helix-coil transition models assume that polypeptides are linear chains composed of interconnected segments. Further, models group these sections into two broad categories: coils , random conglomerations of disparate unbound pieces, are represented by the letter 'C', and helices , ordered states where the chain has assumed a structure stabilized by hydrogen bonding , are represented by the letter 'H'. 1  Thus, it is possible to loosely represent a macromolecule as a string such as CCCCHCCHCHHHHHCHCCC and so forth. The number of coils and helices factors into the calculation of fractional helicity,   θ   θ   \theta   , defined as      θ  =    ⟨  i  ⟩   N       θ     delimited-⟨⟩  i   N     \theta=\frac{\left\langle i\right\rangle}{N}   where      ⟨  i  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  i    \left\langle i\right\rangle   is the average helicity and     N   N   N   is the number of helix or coil units.

The probability of any given monomer being a helix or coil is affected by which the previous monomer is; that is, whether the new site is a nucleation or propagation.  By convention, a coil unit ('C') is always of statistical weight 1. Addition of a helix state ('H') to a previously coiled state (nucleation) is assigned a statistical weight    σ  s      σ  s    \sigma s   , where   σ   σ   \sigma   is the nucleation parameter and      s  =    [  H  ]    [  C  ]        s     delimited-[]  H    delimited-[]  C      s=\frac{[H]}{[C]}   Adding a helix state to a site that is already a helix (propagation) has a statistical weight of   s   s   s   . For most proteins ,      σ  ≪  1  <  s       much-less-than  σ  1       s     \sigma\ll 1   which makes the propagation of a helix more favorable than nucleation of a helix from coil state. 2  From these parameters, it is possible to compute the fractional helicity   θ   θ   \theta   . The average helicity    ⟨  i  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  i    \left\langle i\right\rangle   is given by       ⟨  i  ⟩   =    (   s  q   )     d  q    d  s          delimited-⟨⟩  i       s  q       d  q     d  s       \left\langle i\right\rangle=\left(\frac{s}{q}\right)\frac{dq}{ds}   where   s   s   s   is the statistical weight and   q   q   q   is the partition function given by the sum of the probabilities of each site on the polypeptide. The fractional helicity is thus given by the equation      θ  =    1  N    (   s  q   )     d  q    d  s         θ      1  N     s  q       d  q     d  s       \theta=\frac{1}{N}\left(\frac{s}{q}\right)\frac{dq}{ds}     Statistical mechanics  The Zimm–Bragg model is equivalent to a one-dimensional Ising model and has no long-range interactions, i.e., interactions between residues well separated along the backbone; therefore, by the famous argument of Rudolf Peierls , it cannot undergo a phase transition .  The statistical mechanics of the Zimm–Bragg model 3 may be solved exactly using the transfer-matrix method. The two parameters of the Zimm–Bragg model are σ, the statistical weight for nucleating a helix and s , the statistical weight for propagating a helix. These parameters may depend on the residue j ; for example, a proline residue may easily nucleate a helix but not propagate one; a leucine residue may nucleate and propagate a helix easily; whereas glycine may disfavor both the nucleation and propagation of a helix. Since only nearest-neighbour interactions are considered in the Zimm–Bragg model, the full partition function for a chain of N residues can be written as follows      𝒵  =    (  0  ,  1  )   ⋅   {    ∏   j  =  1   N    𝐖  j    }   ⋅   (  1  ,  1  )        𝒵   normal-⋅   0  1      superscript   subscript  product    j  1    N    subscript  𝐖  j      1  1      \mathcal{Z}=\left(0,1\right)\cdot\left\{\prod_{j=1}^{N}\mathbf{W}_{j}\right\}%
 \cdot\left(1,1\right)     where the 2x2 transfer matrix W j of the j th residue equals the matrix of statistical weights for the state transitions       𝐖  j   =   [      s  j     1        σ  j    s  j      1     ]        subscript  𝐖  j      subscript  s  j   1       subscript  σ  j    subscript  s  j    1      \mathbf{W}_{j}=\begin{bmatrix}s_{j}&1\\
 \par
 \sigma_{j}s_{j}&1\end{bmatrix}     The row-column entry in the transfer matrix equals the statistical weight for making a transition from state row in residue j-1 to state column in residue j . The two states here are helix (the first) and coil (the second). Thus, the upper left entry s is the statistical weight for transitioning from helix to helix, whereas the lower left entry σs is that for transitioning from coil to helix.
