   Geometric Brownian motion      Geometric Brownian motion   A geometric Brownian motion (GBM) (also known as exponential Brownian motion ) is a continuous-time stochastic process in which the logarithm of the randomly varying quantity follows a Brownian motion (also called a Wiener process ) with drift . 1 It is an important example of stochastic processes satisfying a stochastic differential equation (SDE); in particular, it is used in mathematical finance to model stock prices in the Black‚ÄìScholes model .  Technical definition: the SDE  A stochastic process S t is said to follow a GBM if it satisfies the following stochastic differential equation (SDE):       d   S  t    =    Œº    S  t    d  t   +   œÉ    S  t    d   W  t           d   subscript  S  t        Œº   subscript  S  t   d  t     œÉ   subscript  S  t   d   subscript  W  t       dS_{t}=\mu S_{t}\,dt+\sigma S_{t}\,dW_{t}     where    W  t     subscript  W  t    W_{t}   is a Wiener process or Brownian motion , and   Œº   Œº   \mu   ('the percentage drift') and   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   ('the percentage volatility') are constants.  The former is used to model deterministic trends, while the latter term is often used to model a set of unpredictable events occurring during this motion.  Solving the SDE  For an arbitrary initial value S 0 the above SDE has the analytic solution (under It≈ç's interpretation ):        S  t   =    S  0    exp   (     (   Œº  -    œÉ  2   2    )   t   +   œÉ   W  t     )      .       subscript  S  t      subscript  S  0           Œº     superscript  œÉ  2   2    t     œÉ   subscript  W  t         S_{t}=S_{0}\exp\left(\left(\mu-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\right)t+\sigma W_{t}\right).     To arrive at this formula, let us divide the SDE by    S  t     subscript  S  t    S_{t}   , and write it in It≈ç integral form:         ‚à´  0  t     d   S  s     S  s     =     Œº   t   +    œÉ     W  t       ,    assuming   W  0    =  0‚Äâ.      formulae-sequence      superscript   subscript   0   t       d   subscript  S  s     subscript  S  s         Œº  t     œÉ   subscript  W  t          assuming   subscript  W  0    0‚Äâ.     \int_{0}^{t}\frac{dS_{s}}{S_{s}}=\mu\,t+\sigma\,W_{t}\,,\qquad\text{assuming }%
 W_{0}=0\,.     Of course,     d   S  t     S  t         d   subscript  S  t     subscript  S  t     \frac{dS_{t}}{S_{t}}   looks related to the derivative of    ln   S  t        subscript  S  t     \ln S_{t}   ; however,    S  t     subscript  S  t    S_{t}   being an It≈ç process, we need to use It≈ç calculus : by It≈ç's formula , we have        ln    S  t    S  0     =     (   Œº  -     œÉ  2   2     )   t   +   œÉ    W  t       .           subscript  S  t    subscript  S  0           Œº     superscript  œÉ  2   2    t     œÉ   subscript  W  t       \ln\frac{S_{t}}{S_{0}}=\left(\mu-\frac{\sigma^{2}}{2}\,\right)t+\sigma W_{t}\,.     In this case we have:      S  t     subscript  S  t    S_{t}     Plugging back to the equation we got from the SDE, we obtain        ùîº   (   S  t   )    =    S  0    e   Œº  t      ,        ùîº   subscript  S  t       subscript  S  0    superscript  e    Œº  t       \mathbb{E}(S_{t})=S_{0}e^{\mu t},     Exponentiating gives the solution claimed above.  Properties  The above solution      Var   (   S  t   )    =    S  0  2    e   2  Œº  t     (    e    œÉ  2   t    -  1   )     ,       Var   subscript  S  t       superscript   subscript  S  0   2    superscript  e    2  Œº  t       superscript  e     superscript  œÉ  2   t    1      \operatorname{Var}(S_{t})=S_{0}^{2}e^{2\mu t}\left(e^{\sigma^{2}t}-1\right),   (for any value of t) is a log-normally distributed  random variable with expected value and variance given by 2         f   S  t     (  s  ;  Œº  ,  œÉ  ,  t  )    =     1    2  œÄ        1   s  œÉ   t       exp   (   -     (    ln  s   -   ln   S  0    -    (   Œº  -    1  2    œÉ  2     )   t    )   2    2   œÉ  2   t     )      .         subscript  f   subscript  S  t     s  Œº  œÉ  t        1      2  œÄ       1    s  œÉ    t            superscript      s      subscript  S  0        Œº      1  2    superscript  œÉ  2     t    2     2   superscript  œÉ  2   t         f_{S_{t}}(s;\mu,\sigma,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}}\,\frac{1}{s\sigma\sqrt{t}}\,%
 \exp\left(-\frac{\left(\ln s-\ln S_{0}-\left(\mu-\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}\right)t%
 \right)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}t}\right).         d   log   (  S  )        d    S     \displaystyle d\log(S)   that is the probability density function of a S t is:       ùîº   log   (   S  t   )     =    log   (   S  0   )    +    (   Œº  -    œÉ  2   /  2    )   t          ùîº     subscript  S  t          subscript  S  0        Œº     superscript  œÉ  2   2    t      \mathbb{E}\log(S_{t})=\log(S_{0})+(\mu-\sigma^{2}/2)t     When deriving further properties of GBM, use can be made of the SDE of which GBM is the solution, or the explicit solution given above can be used. For example, consider the stochastic process log( S t ). This is an interesting process, because in the Black‚ÄìScholes model it is related to the log return of the stock price. Using It≈ç's lemma with f ( S ) = log( S ) gives      log   (   S  t   )        subscript  S  t     \displaystyle\log(S_{t})   It follows that     ùîº   log   (   S  t   )     =    log   (   S  0   )    +    (   Œº  -    œÉ  2   /  2    )   t          ùîº     subscript  S  t          subscript  S  0        Œº     superscript  œÉ  2   2    t      \mathbb{E}\log(S_{t})=\log(S_{0})+(\mu-\sigma^{2}/2)t   .  This result can also be derived by applying the logarithm to the explicit solution of GBM:       d   S  t  i    =     Œº  i     S  t  i    d  t   +    œÉ  i     S  t  i    d   W  t  i           d   superscript   subscript  S  t   i         subscript  Œº  i    superscript   subscript  S  t   i   d  t      subscript  œÉ  i    superscript   subscript  S  t   i   d   superscript   subscript  W  t   i       dS_{t}^{i}=\mu_{i}S_{t}^{i}\,dt+\sigma_{i}S_{t}^{i}\,dW_{t}^{i}   Taking the expectation yields the same result as above     ùîº   (   d   W  t  i   d   W  t  j    )    =    œÅ   i  ,  j    d  t         ùîº    d   superscript   subscript  W  t   i   d   superscript   subscript  W  t   j        subscript  œÅ   i  j    d  t     \mathbb{E}(dW_{t}^{i}dW_{t}^{j})=\rho_{i,j}dt   .  Multivariate version  GBM can be extended to the case where there are multiple correlated price paths.  Each price path follows the underlying process       œÅ   i  ,  i    =  1       subscript  œÅ   i  i    1    \rho_{i,i}=1   , where the Wiener processes are correlated such that     Cov   (   S  t  i   ,   S  t  j   )    =    S  0  i    S  0  j    e    (    Œº  i   +   Œº  j    )   t     (    e    œÅ   i  ,  j     œÉ  i    œÉ  j   t    -  1   )          Cov    superscript   subscript  S  t   i    superscript   subscript  S  t   j        superscript   subscript  S  0   i    superscript   subscript  S  0   j    superscript  e       subscript  Œº  i    subscript  Œº  j    t       superscript  e     subscript  œÅ   i  j     subscript  œÉ  i    subscript  œÉ  j   t    1      \mathrm{Cov}(S_{t}^{i},S_{t}^{j})=S_{0}^{i}S_{0}^{j}e^{(\mu_{i}+\mu_{j})t}%
 \left(e^{\rho_{i,j}\sigma_{i}\sigma_{j}t}-1\right)   where   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   .  For the multivariate case, this implies that  $$\mathrm{Cov}(S_{t}^i, S_{t}^j) = S_0^i S_0^j e^{(\mu_i + \mu_j) t }\left(e^{\rho_{i,j} \sigma_i \sigma_j t}-1\right)$$ .  Use in finance  Geometric Brownian motion is used to model stock prices in the Black‚ÄìScholes model and is the most widely used model of stock price behavior. 3  Some of the arguments for using GBM to model stock prices are:   The expected returns of GBM are independent of the value of the process (stock price), which agrees with what we would expect in reality. 4  A GBM process only assumes positive values, just like real stock prices.  A GBM process shows the same kind of 'roughness' in its paths as we see in real stock prices.  Calculations with GBM processes are relatively easy.   However, GBM is not a completely realistic model, in particular it falls short of reality in the following points:   In real stock prices, volatility changes over time (possibly stochastically ), but in GBM, volatility is assumed constant.  In real life, stock prices often show jumps caused by unpredictable events or news, but in GBM, the path is continuous (no discontinuity).   Extensions  In an attempt to make GBM more realistic as a model for stock prices, one can drop the assumption that the volatility ( $\sigma$ ) is constant. If we assume that the volatility is a deterministic function of the stock price and time, this is called a local volatility model. If instead we assume that the volatility has a randomness of its own‚Äîoften described by a different equation driven by a different Brownian Motion‚Äîthe model is called a stochastic volatility model.
