   Szpiro's conjecture      Szpiro's conjecture   In number theory , Szpiro's conjecture concerns a relationship between the conductor and the discriminant of an elliptic curve . In a general form, it is equivalent to the well-known abc conjecture . It is named for Lucien Szpiro who formulated it in the 1980s.  The conjecture states that: given ε > 0, there exists a constant C (ε) such that for any elliptic curve E defined over Q with minimal discriminant Δ and conductor f , we have        |  Δ  |   ≤    C   (  ε  )    ⋅   f   6  +  ε      .        normal-Δ    normal-⋅    C  ε    superscript  f    6  ε       |\Delta|\leq C(\varepsilon)\cdot f^{6+\varepsilon}.\,     The modified Szpiro conjecture states that: given ε > 0, there exists a constant C (ε) such that for any elliptic curve E defined over Q with invariants c 4 , c 6 and conductor f (see Tate's algorithm#Notation ), we have        max   {    |   c  4   |   3   ,    |   c  6   |   2   }    ≤    C   (  ε  )    ⋅   f   6  +  ε      .         superscript     subscript  c  4    3    superscript     subscript  c  6    2     normal-⋅    C  ε    superscript  f    6  ε       \max\{|c_{4}|^{3},|c_{6}|^{2}\}\leq C(\varepsilon)\cdot f^{6+\varepsilon}.\,     References       "  Category:Conjectures  Category:Number theory
