   Methylated-thiol-coenzyme M methyltransferase      Methylated-thiol-coenzyme M methyltransferase   Methylated-thiol-coenzyme M methyltransferase (, mtsA (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name methylated-thiol:coenzyme M methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   methanethiol + coenzyme M    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    methyl-CoM + hydrogen sulfide (overall reaction)  (1a) methanethiol + [Co(I) methylated-thiol-specific corrinoid protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [methyl-Co(III) methylated-thiol-specific corrinoid protein] + hydrogen sulfide  (1b) [methyl-Co(III) methylated-thiol-specific corrinoid protein] + coenzyme M   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   methyl-CoM + [Co(I) methylated-thiol-specific corrinoid protein]   This enzyme involved in methanogenesis from methylated thiols, such as methane thiol , dimethyl sulfide , and 3-S-methylmercaptopropionate.
