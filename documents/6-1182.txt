   Swain equation      Swain equation   The Swain equation relates the kinetic isotope effect for the protium / tritium combination with that of the protium / deuterium combination according to:        k  H    k  T    =    (    k  H    k  D    )   1.442          subscript  k  H    subscript  k  T     superscript     subscript  k  H    subscript  k  D    1.442     \frac{k_{H}}{k_{T}}=(\frac{k_{H}}{k_{D}})^{1.442}     where k H,D,T are the reaction rate constants for the protonated, deuterated and tritiated reactants respectively.
