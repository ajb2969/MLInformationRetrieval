   (myelin-proteolipid) O-palmitoyltransferase      (myelin-proteolipid) O-palmitoyltransferase   In enzymology , a [myelin-proteolipid] O-palmitoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   palmitoyl-CoA + [myelin proteolipid]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + O-palmitoyl-[myelin proteolipid]   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are palmitoyl-CoA and myelin proteolipid , whereas its two products are CoA and O-palmitoyl-myelin proteolipid .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is palmitoyl-CoA:[myelin-proteolipid] O-palmitoyltransferase . Other names in common use include myelin PLP acyltransferase , acyl-protein synthetase , and myelin-proteolipid O-palmitoyltransferase .
