As a holosnub, it is represented by Schläfli symbol βr{4,3} and Coxeter diagram .  The vertex arrangement of this compound is shared by a convex nonuniform truncated cuboctahedron , having rectangular faces, alongside irregular hexagons and octagons , each alternating with two edge lengths.  Cartesian coordinates  Cartesian coordinates for the vertices are all the permutations of   (±1, ±ξ, ±1/ξ)   where ξ is the real solution to         ξ  3   +   ξ  2   +  ξ   =  1   ,         superscript  ξ  3    superscript  ξ  2   ξ   1    \xi^{3}+\xi^{2}+\xi=1,\,     which can be written      ξ  =    1  3    (     17  +   3   33     3   -     -  17   +   3   33     3   -  1   )        ξ      1  3        3     17    3    33         3       17     3    33      1      \xi=\frac{1}{3}\left(\sqrt[3]{17+3\sqrt{33}}-\sqrt[3]{-17+3\sqrt{33}}-1\right)     or approximately 0.543689. ξ is the reciprocal of the tribonacci constant .  Truncated cuboctahedron  This compound can be seen as the union of the two chiral alternations of a truncated cuboctahedron :      References    .   "  Category:Polyhedral compounds
