As a holosnub, it is represented by Schläfli symbol βr{4,3} and Coxeter diagram .
The vertex arrangement of this compound is shared by a convex nonuniform truncated cuboctahedron, having rectangular faces, alongside irregular hexagons and octagons, each alternating with two edge lengths.
Cartesian coordinates
Cartesian coordinates for the vertices are all the permutations of

(±1, ±ξ, ±1/ξ)
 

where ξ is the real solution to



which can be written



or approximately 0.543689. ξ is the reciprocal of the tribonacci constant.
Truncated cuboctahedron
This compound can be seen as the union of the two chiral alternations of a truncated cuboctahedron:
