   RRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase      RRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a rRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + rRNA containing N 6 -methyladenine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and rRNA , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and rRNA containing N6-methyl adenine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:rRNA (adenine-N6-)-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include ribosomal ribonucleate adenine 6-methyltransferase , gene ksgA methyltransferase , ribonucleic acid-adenine (N6) methylase , ErmC 23S rRNA methyltransferase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:rRNA (adenine-6-N-)-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
