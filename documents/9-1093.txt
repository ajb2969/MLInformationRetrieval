Parabolic Lie algebra

In algebra, a parabolic Lie algebra

 
  is a subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra

 
  satisfying one of the following two conditions:



 
  contains a maximal solvable subalgebra (a Borel subalgebra) of 
 
 
 
 
 ;
the Killing perp of 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  is the nilradical of 
 
 
 
 .

These conditions are equivalent over an algebraically closed field of characteristic zero, such as the complex numbers. If the field 
 
 
 
  is not algebraically closed, then the first condition is replaced by the assumption that



 
 
  contains a Borel subalgebra of 
 
 


where 
 
 
 
  is the algebraic closure of 
 
 
 
 .
