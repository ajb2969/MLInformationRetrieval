   Parabolic Lie algebra      Parabolic Lie algebra   In algebra , a parabolic Lie algebra    𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   is a subalgebra of a semisimple Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   satisfying one of the following two conditions:      𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   contains a maximal solvable subalgebra (a Borel subalgebra ) of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   ;  the Killing perp of   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is the nilradical of   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   .   These conditions are equivalent over an algebraically closed  field of characteristic zero , such as the complex numbers . If the field   𝔽   𝔽   \mathbb{F}   is not algebraically closed, then the first condition is replaced by the assumption that       𝔭   ⊗  𝔽    𝔽  ¯       subscript  tensor-product  𝔽   𝔭   normal-¯  𝔽     \mathfrak{p}\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}\overline{\mathbb{F}}   contains a Borel subalgebra of    𝔤   ⊗  𝔽    𝔽  ¯       subscript  tensor-product  𝔽   𝔤   normal-¯  𝔽     \mathfrak{g}\otimes_{\mathbb{F}}\overline{\mathbb{F}}      where    𝔽  ¯     normal-¯  𝔽    \overline{\mathbb{F}}   is the algebraic closure of   𝔽   𝔽   \mathbb{F}   .
