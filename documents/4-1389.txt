   Distance (graph theory)      Distance (graph theory)   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the distance between two vertices in a graph is the number of edges in a shortest path (also called a graph geodesic ) connecting them. This is also known as the geodesic distance . 1 Notice that there may be more than one shortest path between two vertices. 2 If there is no path connecting the two vertices, i.e., if they belong to different connected components , then conventionally the distance is defined as infinite.  In the case of a directed graph the distance    d   (  u  ,  v  )       d   u  v     d(u,v)   between two vertices   u   u   u   and   v   v   v   is defined as the length of a shortest path from   u   u   u   to   v   v   v   consisting of arcs, provided at least one such path exists. 3 Notice that, in contrast with the case of undirected graphs,    d   (  u  ,  v  )       d   u  v     d(u,v)   does not necessarily coincide with    d   (  v  ,  u  )       d   v  u     d(v,u)   , and it might be the case that one is defined while the other is not.  Related concepts  A metric space defined over a set of points in terms of distances in a graph defined over the set is called a graph metric . The vertex set (of an undirected graph) and the distance function form a metric space, if and only if the graph is connected .  The eccentricity     ϵ   (  v  )       ϵ  v    \epsilon(v)   of a vertex   v   v   v   is the greatest geodesic distance between   v   v   v   and any other vertex. It can be thought of as how far a node is from the node most distant from it in the graph.  The radius    r   r   r   of a graph is the minimum eccentricity of any vertex or, in symbols,    r  =     min   v  ∈  V    ϵ    (  v  )        r      subscript     v  V    ϵ   v     r=\min_{v\in V}\epsilon(v)   .  The diameter    d   d   d   of a graph is the maximum eccentricity of any vertex in the graph. That is,   d   d   d   it is the greatest distance between any pair of vertices or, alternatively,    d  =     max   v  ∈  V    ϵ    (  v  )        d      subscript     v  V    ϵ   v     d=\max_{v\in V}\epsilon(v)   . To find the diameter of a graph, first find the shortest path between each pair of vertices . The greatest length of any of these paths is the diameter of the graph.  A central vertex in a graph of radius   r   r   r   is one whose eccentricity is   r   r   r   —that is, a vertex that achieves the radius or, equivalently, a vertex   v   v   v   such that     ϵ   (  v  )    =  r        ϵ  v   r    \epsilon(v)=r   .  A peripheral vertex in a graph of diameter   d   d   d   is one that is distance   d   d   d   from some other vertex—that is, a vertex that achieves the diameter. Formally,   v   v   v   is peripheral if     ϵ   (  v  )    =  d        ϵ  v   d    \epsilon(v)=d   .  A pseudo-peripheral vertex    v   v   v   has the property that for any vertex   u   u   u   , if   v   v   v   is as far away from   u   u   u   as possible, then   u   u   u   is as far away from   v   v   v   as possible. Formally, a vertex u is pseudo-peripheral, if for each vertex v with     d   (  u  ,  v  )    =   ϵ   (  u  )          d   u  v      ϵ  u     d(u,v)=\epsilon(u)   holds     ϵ   (  u  )    =   ϵ   (  v  )          ϵ  u     ϵ  v     \epsilon(u)=\epsilon(v)   .  The partition of a graphs vertices into subsets by their distances from a given starting vertex is called the level structure of the graph.  A graph such that for every pair of vertices there is a unique shortest path connecting them is called a geodetic graph . For example, all trees are geodetic. 4  Algorithm for finding pseudo-peripheral vertices  Often peripheral sparse matrix algorithms need a starting vertex with a high eccentricity. A peripheral vertex would be perfect, but is often hard to calculate. In most circumstances a pseudo-peripheral vertex can be used. A pseudo-peripheral vertex can easily be found with the following algorithm:   Choose a vertex   u   u   u   .  Among all the vertices that are as far from   u   u   u   as possible, let   v   v   v   be one with minimal degree .  If     ϵ   (  v  )    >   ϵ   (  u  )          ϵ  v     ϵ  u     \epsilon(v)>\epsilon(u)   then set    u  =  v      u  v    u=v   and repeat with step 2, else   v   v   v   is a pseudo-peripheral vertex.
