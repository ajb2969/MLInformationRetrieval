Sulfite reductase (NADPH)

Sulfite reductase (NADPH) (, sulfite (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) reductase, NADPH-sulfite reductase, NADPH-dependent sulfite reductase, H2S-NADP oxidoreductase, sulfite reductase (NADPH2)) is an enzyme with system name hydrogen-sulfide:NADP+ oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction

hydrogen sulfide + 3 NADP+ + 3 H2O 
 
 
sulfite + 3 NADPH + 3 H+


Sulfite reductase is an iron flavoprotein (FAD and FMN).
