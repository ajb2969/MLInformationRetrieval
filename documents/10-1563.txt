   Sulfite reductase (NADPH)      Sulfite reductase (NADPH)   Sulfite reductase (NADPH) (, sulfite (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate) reductase , NADPH-sulfite reductase , NADPH-dependent sulfite reductase , H 2 S-NADP oxidoreductase , sulfite reductase (NADPH 2 ) ) is an enzyme with system name hydrogen-sulfide:NADP + oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalises the following chemical reaction   hydrogen sulfide + 3 NADP + + 3 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    sulfite + 3 NADPH + 3 H +    Sulfite reductase is an iron flavoprotein (FAD and FMN).
