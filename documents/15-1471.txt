Abscisate beta-glucosyltransferase

Abscisate beta-glucosyltransferase (, ABA-glucosyltransferase, ABA-GTase, AOG) is an enzyme with system name UDP-D-glucose:abscisate beta-D-glucosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-D-glucose + abscisate

 
  UDP + beta-D-glucopyranosyl abscisate
 

The enzyme acts better on (S)-2-trans-abscisate than the natural (S)-2-cis isomer, abscisate, or its enantiomer, the (R)-2-cis isomer.
