   Divisia monetary aggregates index      Divisia monetary aggregates index   In econometrics and official statistics , and particularly in banking , the Divisia monetary aggregates index is an index of money supply . It is a particular application of a Divisia index to monetary aggregates.  Background  The monetary aggregates used by most central banks (notably the U.S. Federal Reserve ) are simple-sum indexes, in which all monetary components are assigned the same weight:        M  t   =    ∑   j  =  1   n    x   j  t      ,       subscript  M  t     superscript   subscript     j  1    n    subscript  x    j  t       M_{t}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}x_{jt},     where    x   j  t      subscript  x    j  t     x_{jt}   is one of the   n   n   n   monetary components of the monetary aggregate    M  t     subscript  M  t    M_{t}   . This summation index implies that all monetary components contribute equally to the money total, and it views all components as dollar for dollar perfect substitutes . It has been argued that such an index does not weigh these components in a way that properly summarizes the services of the quantities of money.  Over the years, there have been many attempts at properly weighting monetary components within a simple-sum aggregate. An index can rigorously apply microeconomic - and aggregation-theoretic foundations in the construction of monetary aggregates . This approach to monetary aggregation was derived and advocated by William A. Barnett (1980) and has led to the construction of monetary aggregates based on Diewert's (1976) class of superlative quantity index numbers. The new aggregates are called the Divisia aggregates or Monetary Services Indexes. Salam Fayyad 's 1986 PhD dissertation did early research with those aggregates using U.S. data.  This Divisia index (approximated in discrete time) is defined as         log   M  t  D    -   log   M   t  -  1   D     =    ∑   j  =  1   n     s   j  t   *    (    log   x   j  t     -   log   x   j  ,   t  -  1       )      ,           superscript   subscript  M  t   D       superscript   subscript  M    t  1    D       superscript   subscript     j  1    n      superscript   subscript  s    j  t           subscript  x    j  t        subscript  x   j    t  1           \log M_{t}^{D}-\log M_{t-1}^{D}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}s_{jt}^{*}(\log x_{jt}-\log x_{j%
 ,t-1}),     according to which the growth rate of the aggregate is the weighted average of the growth rates of the component quantities. The discrete time Divisia weights are defined as the expenditure shares averaged over the two periods of the change        s   j  t   *   =    1  2    (    s   j  t    +   s   j  ,   t  -  1      )     ,       superscript   subscript  s    j  t          1  2      subscript  s    j  t     subscript  s   j    t  1         s_{jt}^{*}=\frac{1}{2}(s_{jt}+s_{j,t-1}),     for    j  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       j   1  normal-…  n     j=1,...,n   , where        s   j  t    =     π   j  t     x   j  t       ∑   k  =  1   n     π   k  t     x   k  t        ,       subscript  s    j  t         subscript  π    j  t     subscript  x    j  t       superscript   subscript     k  1    n      subscript  π    k  t     subscript  x    k  t         s_{jt}=\frac{\pi_{jt}x_{jt}}{\sum_{k=1}^{n}\pi_{kt}x_{kt}},     is the expenditure share of asset    j   j   j   during period   t   t   t   , and    π   j  t      subscript  π    j  t     \pi_{jt}   is the user cost of asset   j   j   j   , derived by Barnett (1978),        π   j  t    =     R  t   -   r   j  t      1  +   R  t      ,       subscript  π    j  t         subscript  R  t    subscript  r    j  t       1   subscript  R  t       \pi_{jt}=\frac{R_{t}-r_{jt}}{1+R_{t}},     which is just the opportunity cost of holding a dollar's worth of the   j   j   j   th asset. In the last equation,    r   j  t      subscript  r    j  t     r_{jt}   is the market yield on the   j   j   j   th asset, and    R  t     subscript  R  t    R_{t}   is the yield available on a 'benchmark' asset that is held only to carry wealth between different time periods.  In the literature on aggregation and index number theory, the Divisia approach to monetary aggregation,    M  t  D     superscript   subscript  M  t   D    M_{t}^{D}   , is widely viewed as a viable and theoretically appropriate alternative to the simple-sum approach. See, e.g., International Monetary Fund (2008), Macroeconomic Dynamics (2009), and Journal of Econometrics (2011). The simple-sum approach,    M  t     subscript  M  t    M_{t}   , which is still in use by some central banks, adds up imperfect substitutes, such as currency and non-negotiable certificates of deposit, without weights reflecting differences in their contributions to the economy's liquidity. A primary source of theory, applications, and data from the aggregation-theoretic approach to monetary aggregation is the Center for Financial Stability in New York City.
