<h1>Bézier surface</h1>
<hr/>
<p><strong>Bézier surfaces</strong> are a species of <a href="spline_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">mathematical spline</a> used in <a href="computer_graphics" title="wikilink">computer graphics</a>, <a href="computer-aided_design" title="wikilink">computer-aided design</a>, and <a href="finite_element" title="wikilink">finite element</a> modeling. As with the <a href="Bézier_curve" title="wikilink">Bézier curve</a>, a Bézier surface is defined by a set of control points. Similar to interpolation in many respects, a key difference is that the surface does not, in general, pass through the central control points; rather, it is "stretched" toward them as though each were an attractive force. They are visually intuitive, and for many applications, mathematically convenient.</p>
<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p>Bézier surfaces were first described in 1962 by the <a href="France" title="wikilink">French</a> engineer <a href="Pierre_Bézier" title="wikilink">Pierre Bézier</a> who used them to design <a class="uri" href="automobile" title="wikilink">automobile</a> bodies. Bézier surfaces can be of any degree, but bicubic Bézier surfaces generally provide enough <a href="degrees_of_freedom_(physics_and_chemistry)" title="wikilink">degrees of freedom</a> for most applications.</p>
<h2 id="equation">Equation</h2>
<p> A given Bézier surface of degree (<em>n</em>, <em>m</em>) is defined by a set of (<em>n</em> + 1)(<em>m</em> + 1) <a href="Control_point_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">control points</a> <strong>k</strong><sub><em>i,j</em></sub>. It maps the <a href="unit_square" title="wikilink">unit square</a> into a smooth-continuous surface embedded within a space of the same <a class="uri" href="dimensionality" title="wikilink">dimensionality</a> as { <strong>k</strong><sub><em>i,j</em></sub> }. For example, if <strong>k</strong> are all points in a four-dimensional space, then the surface will be within a four-dimensional space.</p>
<p>A two-dimensional Bézier surface can be defined as a <a href="parametric_surface" title="wikilink">parametric surface</a> where the position of a point <strong>p</strong> as a function of the parametric coordinates <em>u</em>, <em>v</em> is given by: <a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\mathbf{p}(u, v) = 
     \sum_{i=0}^n \sum_{j=0}^m 
     B_i^n(u) \; B_j^m(v) \; \mathbf{k}_{i,j}$$</span></p>
<p>evaluated over the <a href="unit_square" title="wikilink">unit square</a>, where</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$B_i^n(u) = {n \choose i} \; u^i (1-u)^{n-i}$$</span></p>
<p>is a <a href="Bernstein_polynomial" title="wikilink">Bernstein polynomial</a>, and</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$${n \choose i} = \frac{n!}{i! (n-i)!}$$</span></p>
<p>is the <a href="binomial_coefficient" title="wikilink">binomial coefficient</a>.</p>
<p>Some properties of Bézier surfaces:</p>
<ul>
<li>A Bézier surface will transform in the same way as its control points under all <a href="linear_transformation" title="wikilink">linear transformations</a> and <a href="translation" title="wikilink">translations</a>.</li>
<li>All <em>u</em> = constant and <em>v</em> = constant lines in the (<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) space, and, in particular, all four edges of the deformed (<em>u</em>, <em>v</em>) unit square are Bézier curves.</li>
<li>A Bézier surface will lie completely within the <a href="convex_hull" title="wikilink">convex hull</a> of its control points, and therefore also completely within the <a href="bounding_box" title="wikilink">bounding box</a> of its control points in any given <a href="Cartesian_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">Cartesian coordinate system</a>.</li>
<li>The points in the patch corresponding to the corners of the deformed unit square coincide with four of the control points.</li>
<li>However, a Bézier surface does not generally pass through its other control points.</li>
</ul>
<p>Generally, the most common use of Bézier surfaces is as nets of <strong>bicubic patches</strong> (where <em>m</em> = <em>n</em> = 3). The geometry of a single bicubic patch is thus completely defined by a set of 16 control points. These are typically linked up to form a <a href="B-spline_surface" title="wikilink">B-spline surface</a> in a similar way as Bézier curves are linked up to form a <a class="uri" href="B-spline" title="wikilink">B-spline</a> curve.</p>
<p>Simpler Bézier surfaces are formed from <strong>biquadratic patches</strong> (<em>m</em> = <em>n</em> = 2), or <a href="Bézier_triangle" title="wikilink">Bézier triangles</a>.</p>

<p>Bézier patch meshes are superior to meshes of triangles as a representation of smooth surfaces, since they are much more compact, easier to manipulate, and have much better <a href="continuous_function" title="wikilink">continuity</a> properties. In addition, other common parametric surfaces such as <a href="sphere" title="wikilink">spheres</a> and <a href="cylinder_(geometry)" title="wikilink">cylinders</a> can be well approximated by relatively small numbers of cubic Bézier patches.</p>
<p>However, Bézier patch meshes are difficult to render directly. One problem with Bézier patches is that calculating their intersections with lines is difficult, making them awkward for pure <a href="Ray_tracing_(graphics)" title="wikilink">ray tracing</a> or other direct geometric techniques which do not use subdivision or successive approximation techniques. They are also difficult to combine directly with perspective projection algorithms.</p>
<p>For this reason, Bézier patch meshes are in general eventually decomposed into meshes of flat triangles by 3D <a href="rendering_pipeline" title="wikilink">rendering pipelines</a>. In high-quality rendering, the subdivision is adjusted to be so fine that the individual triangle boundaries cannot be seen. To avoid a "blobby" look, fine detail is usually applied to Bézier surfaces at this stage using <a href="texture_map" title="wikilink">texture maps</a>, <a href="bump_map" title="wikilink">bump maps</a> and other <a href="pixel_shader" title="wikilink">pixel shader</a> techniques.</p>
<p>A Bézier patch of degree (<em>m</em>, <em>n</em>) may be constructed out of two <a href="Bézier_triangle" title="wikilink">Bézier triangles</a> of degree m+n, or out of a single Bézier triangle of degree <em>m</em> + <em>n</em>, with the input domain as a <a href="square_(geometry)" title="wikilink">square</a> instead of as a <a class="uri" href="triangle" title="wikilink">triangle</a>.</p>
<p>A Bézier triangle of degree <em>m</em> may also be constructed out of a Bézier surface of degree (<em>m</em>, <em>m</em>), with the control points so that one edge is squashed to a point, or with the input domain as a triangle instead of as a square.</p>
