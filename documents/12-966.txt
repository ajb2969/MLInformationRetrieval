   Schild's ladder      Schild's ladder   In the theory of general relativity , and differential geometry more generally, Schild's ladder is a first-order method for approximating  parallel transport of a vector along a curve using only affinely parametrized  geodesics . The method is named for Alfred Schild , who introduced the method during lectures at Princeton University .  Construction  The idea is to identify a tangent vector x at a point    A  0     subscript  A  0    A_{0}   with a geodesic segment of unit length     A  0    X  0        subscript  A  0    subscript  X  0     A_{0}X_{0}   , and to construct an approximate parallelogram with approximately parallel sides     A  0    X  0        subscript  A  0    subscript  X  0     A_{0}X_{0}   and     A  1    X  1        subscript  A  1    subscript  X  1     A_{1}X_{1}   as an approximation of the Levi-Civita parallelogramoid ; the new segment     A  1    X  1        subscript  A  1    subscript  X  1     A_{1}X_{1}   thus corresponds to an approximately parallel translated tangent vector at     A  1   .     subscript  A  1    A_{1}.        (Figure)  A curve in M with a "vector" X 0 at A 0 , identified here as a geodesic segment.   (Figure)  Select A 1 on the original curve. The point P 1 is the midpoint of the geodesic segment X 0 A 1 .   (Figure)  The point X 1 is obtained by following the geodesic A 0 P 1 for twice its parameter length.      Formally, consider a curve γ through a point A 0 in a Riemannian manifold  M , and let x be a tangent vector at A 0 . Then x can be identified with a geodesic segment A 0 X 0 via the exponential map . This geodesic σ satisfies       σ   (  0  )    =    A  0          σ  0    subscript  A  0     \sigma(0)=A_{0}\,            σ  ′    (  0  )    =  x   .         superscript  σ  normal-′   0   x    \sigma^{\prime}(0)=x.\,     The steps of the Schild's ladder construction are:   Let X 0 = σ(1), so the geodesic segment     A  0    X  0        subscript  A  0    subscript  X  0     A_{0}X_{0}   has unit length.  Now let A 1 be a point on γ close to A 0 , and construct the geodesic X 0 A 1 .  Let P 1 be the midpoint of X 0 A 1 in the sense that the segments X 0 P 1 and P 1 A 1 take an equal affine parameter to traverse.  Construct the geodesic A 0 P 1 , and extend it to a point X 1 so that the parameter length of A 0 X 1 is double that of A 0 P 1 .  Finally construct the geodesic A 1 X 1 . The tangent to this geodesic x 1 is then the parallel transport of X 0 to A 1 , at least to first order.   Approximation  This is a discrete approximation of the continuous process of parallel transport. If the ambient space is flat, this is exactly parallel transport, and the steps define parallelograms , which agree with the Levi-Civita parallelogramoid .  In a curved space, the error is given by holonomy around the triangle      A  1    A  0    X  0    ,       subscript  A  1    subscript  A  0    subscript  X  0     A_{1}A_{0}X_{0},   which is equal to the integral of the curvature over the interior of the triangle, by the Ambrose-Singer theorem ; this is a form of Green's theorem (integral around a curve related to integral over interior).  Notes   Schild's ladder requires not only geodesics but also relative distance along geodesics. Relative distance may be provided by affine parametrization of geodesics, from which the required midpoints may be determined.  The parallel transport which is constructed by Schild's ladder is necessarily torsion -free.  A Riemannian metric is not required to generate the geodesics. But if the geodesics are generated from a Riemannian metric, the parallel transport which is constructed in the limit by Schild's ladder is the same as the Levi-Civita connection because this connection is defined to be torsion-free.
