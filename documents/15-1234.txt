Methyl halide transferase




Methyl halide transferase

Methyl halide transferase (, MCT, methyl chloride transferase, S-adenosyl-L-methionine:halide/bisulfide methyltransferase, AtHOL1, AtHOL2, AtHOL3, HMT, S-adenosyl-L-methionine: halide ion methyltransferase, SAM:halide ion methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosylmethionine:iodide methyltransferase.123456 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + iodide

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + methyl iodide


This enzyme contributes to the methyl halide emissions from Arabidopsis thaliana.
