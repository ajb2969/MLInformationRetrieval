   Methyl halide transferase      Methyl halide transferase   Methyl halide transferase (, MCT , methyl chloride transferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:halide/bisulfide methyltransferase , AtHOL1 , AtHOL2 , AtHOL3 , HMT , S-adenosyl-L-methionine: halide ion methyltransferase , SAM:halide ion methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosylmethionine:iodide methyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 5 6 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + iodide    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + methyl iodide    This enzyme contributes to the methyl  halide emissions from Arabidopsis thaliana .
