   Akhiezer's theorem      Akhiezer's theorem   In the mathematical field of complex analysis , Akhiezer's theorem is a result about entire functions proved by Naum Akhiezer . 1  Statement  Let    f   (  z  )       f  z    f(z)   be an entire function of exponential type    τ   τ   τ   , with    f   (  x  )    ≥   0      f  x  normal-  normal-≥  normal-  0    f(x) ≥ 0   for real   x   x   x   . Then the following are equivalent:   There exists an entire function    F   F   F   , of exponential type     τ  /  2      τ  2    τ/2   , having all its zeros in the (closed) upper half plane, such that          f   (  z  )    =   F   (  z  )     F   (   z  ¯   )    ¯          f  z     F  z   normal-¯    F   normal-¯  z        f(z)=F(z)\overline{F(\overline{z})}         One has:          \sum|\operatorname{Im}(1/z_{n})| where are the zeros of   f   f   f   .  Remarks  It is not hard to show that the Fejér–Riesz theorem is a special case. 2  Notes  References   {{ citation   | last = Boas | first = Jr., Ralph Philip | title = Entire functions | publisher = Academic Press Inc. | location = New York | year = 1954 | pages = 124–132 }}   {{ citation   | last = Boas | first = Jr., R.
