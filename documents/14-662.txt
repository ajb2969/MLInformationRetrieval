Akhiezer's theorem

In the mathematical field of complex analysis, Akhiezer's theorem is a result about entire functions proved by Naum Akhiezer.1
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be an entire function of exponential type

 
 , with 
 
 
 
  for real 
 
 
 
 
 . Then the following are equivalent:

There exists an entire function

 
 , of exponential type

 
 , having all its zeros in the (closed) upper half plane, such that










One has:







\sum|\operatorname{Im}(1/z_{n})| where  are the zeros of 
 
 
 
 .
Remarks
It is not hard to show that the Fejér–Riesz theorem is a special case.2
