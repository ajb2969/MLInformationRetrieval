   Gauss sum      Gauss sum   In mathematics , a Gauss sum or Gaussian sum is a particular kind of finite sum of roots of unity , typically       G   (  χ  )    :=   G   (  χ  ,  ψ  )    =   ∑     χ   (  r  )    ⋅  ψ    (  r  )          assign    G  χ     G   χ  ψ              normal-⋅    χ  r   ψ   r       G(\chi):=G(\chi,\psi)=\sum\chi(r)\cdot\psi(r)     where the sum is over elements r of some finite  commutative ring  R , ψ( r ) is a group homomorphism of the additive group  R + into the unit circle , and χ( r ) is a group homomorphism of the unit group  R × into the unit circle, extended to non-unit r where it takes the value 0. Gauss sums are the analogues for finite fields of the Gamma function .  Such sums are ubiquitous in number theory. They occur, for example, in the functional equations of Dirichlet L-functions , where for a Dirichlet character χ the equation relating L ( s , χ) and L (1 − s ,    χ  ¯     normal-¯  χ    \overline{χ}   ) involves a factor        G   (  χ  )    /   |   G   (  χ  )    |    ,        G  χ       G  χ      G(\chi)\ /\ |G(\chi)|,     where    χ  ¯     normal-¯  χ    \overline{χ}   is the complex conjugate of χ.  The case originally considered by C. F. Gauss was the quadratic Gauss sum , for R the field of residues modulo a prime number p , and χ the Legendre symbol . In this case Gauss proved that G (χ) = p 1/2 or ip 1/2 according as p is congruent to 1 or 3 modulo 4.  An alternate form for this Gauss sum is:      ∑   e    2  π  i   r  2    p         superscript  e      2  π  i   superscript  r  2    p      \sum e^{\frac{2\pi ir^{2}}{p}}     Quadratic Gauss sums are closely connected with the theory of theta-functions .  The general theory of Gauss sums was developed in the early nineteenth century, with the use of Jacobi sums and their prime decomposition in cyclotomic fields . Gauss sums over a residue ring of integers mod N are linear combinations of closely related sums called Gaussian periods .  The absolute value of Gauss sums is usually found as an application of Plancherel's theorem on finite groups. In the case where R is a field of p elements and χ is nontrivial, the absolute value is p 1/2 . The determination of the exact value of general Gauss sums, following the result of Gauss on the quadratic case, is a long-standing issue. For some cases see Kummer sum .  Properties of Gauss sums of Dirichlet characters  The Gauss sum of a Dirichlet character modulo N is        G   (  χ  )    =    ∑   a  =  1   N    χ   (  a  )    e    2  π  i  a   /  N       .        G  χ     superscript   subscript     a  1    N     χ  a   superscript  e      2  π  i  a   N        G(\chi)=\sum_{a=1}^{N}\chi(a)e^{2\pi ia/N}.   If χ is moreover primitive , then        |   G   (  χ  )    |   =   N    ,          G  χ      N     |G(\chi)|=\sqrt{N},   in particular, it is non-zero. More generally, if N 0 is the conductor of χ and χ 0 is the primitive Dirichlet character modulo N 0 that induces χ, then the Gauss sum of χ is related to that of χ 0 by       G   (  χ  )    =   μ   (   N  /   N  0    )    χ  0    (   N  /   N  0    )   G   (   χ  0   )          G  χ     μ    N   subscript  N  0     subscript  χ  0     N   subscript  N  0    G   subscript  χ  0      G(\chi)=\mu(N/N_{0})\chi_{0}(N/N_{0})G(\chi_{0})~{}   where μ is the Möbius function . Consequently, G (χ) is non-zero precisely when N / N 0 is squarefree and relatively prime to N 0 . Other relations between G (χ) and Gauss sums of other characters include        G   (   χ  ¯   )    =   χ   (   -  1   )     G   (  χ  )    ¯     ,        G   normal-¯  χ      χ    1    normal-¯    G  χ       G(\overline{\chi})=\chi(-1)\overline{G(\chi)},   where    χ  ¯     normal-¯  χ    \overline{χ}   is the complex conjugate Dirichlet character, and if χ′ is a Dirichlet character modulo N ′ such that N and N ′ are relatively prime, then        G   (   χ   χ  ′    )    =   χ   (   N  ′   )    χ  ′    (  N  )   G   (  χ  )   G   (   χ  ′   )     .        G    χ   superscript  χ  normal-′       χ   superscript  N  normal-′    superscript  χ  normal-′   N  G  χ  G   superscript  χ  normal-′      G(\chi\chi^{\prime})=\chi(N^{\prime})\chi^{\prime}(N)G(\chi)G(\chi^{\prime}).   The relation among G (χχ′), G (χ), and G (χ′) when χ and χ′ are of the same modulus (and χχ′ is primitive) is measured by the Jacobi sum  J (χ, χ′). Specifically,        G   (   χ   χ  ′    )    =    G   (  χ  )   G   (   χ  ′   )     J   (  χ  ,   χ  ′   )      .        G    χ   superscript  χ  normal-′         G  χ  G   superscript  χ  normal-′      J   χ   superscript  χ  normal-′        G(\chi\chi^{\prime})=\frac{G(\chi)G(\chi^{\prime})}{J(\chi,\chi^{\prime})}.
