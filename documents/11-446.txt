   Aminoacyl-tRNA hydrolase      Aminoacyl-tRNA hydrolase   In enzymology , an aminoacyl-tRNA hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-Substituted aminoacyl-tRNA + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-substituted amino acid + tRNA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-Substituted aminoacyl-tRNA and H 2 O , whereas its two products are N-substituted amino acid and tRNA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aminoacyl-tRNA aminoacylhydrolase . Other names in common use include aminoacyl-transfer ribonucleate hydrolase , N-substituted aminoacyl transfer RNA hydrolase , and peptidyl-tRNA hydrolase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 9 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , and .
