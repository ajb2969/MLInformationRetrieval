   Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+)      Methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+)   In enzymology , a methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP+) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:NADP+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include N5,N10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase , 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate:NADP oxidoreductase , 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase , methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase , and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (NADP) . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and one carbon pool by folate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
