Alkylglycerophosphoethanolamine phosphodiesterase




Alkylglycerophosphoethanolamine phosphodiesterase

In enzymology, an alkylglycerophosphoethanolamine phosphodiesterase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine + H2O 
 
 
 
  1-alkyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + ethanolamine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine and H2O, whereas its two products are 1-alkyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and ethanolamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric diester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-alkyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine ethanolaminehydrolase. This enzyme is also called lysophospholipase D. This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism.
