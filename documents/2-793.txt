   Complex geometry      Complex geometry   In mathematics , complex geometry is the study of complex manifolds and functions of many complex variables . Application of transcendental methods to algebraic geometry falls in this category, together with more geometric chapters of complex analysis .  Throughout this article, " analytic " is often dropped for simplicity; for instance, subvarieties or hypersurfaces refer to analytic ones. Following the convention in Wikipedia, varieties are assumed to be irreducible.  Definitions  An analytic subset of a complex-analytic manifold M is locally the zero-locus of some family of holomorphic functions on M . It is called an analytic subvariety if it is irreducible in the Zariski topology.  Line bundles and divisors  Throughout this section, X denotes a complex manifold. Accordance with the definitions of the paragraph " line bundles and divisors " in " projective varieties ", let the regular functions on X denote   ùí™   ùí™   \mathcal{O}   and its invertible subsheaf    ùí™  *     superscript  ùí™     \mathcal{O}^{*}   .„ÄÄAnd let    ‚Ñ≥  X     subscript  ‚Ñ≥  X    \mathcal{M}_{X}   be the sheaf on X associated with    U  ‚Ü¶      maps-to  U  absent    U\mapsto   the total ring of fractions of    Œì   (  U  ,   ùí™  X   )       normal-Œì   U   subscript  ùí™  X      \Gamma(U,\mathcal{O}_{X})   , where    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   are the open affine charts. Then a global section of     ‚Ñ≥  X  *   /   ùí™  X  *        superscript   subscript  ‚Ñ≥  X      superscript   subscript  ùí™  X       \mathcal{M}_{X}^{*}/\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*}   (* means multiplicative group) is called a Cartier divisor on X .  Let    Pic   (  X  )      Pic  X    \operatorname{Pic}(X)   be the set of all isomorphism classes of line bundles on X . It is called the Picard group of X and is naturally isomorphic to     H  1    (  X  ,   ùí™  *   )        superscript  H  1    X   superscript  ùí™       H^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}^{*})   . Taking the short exact sequence of      0  ‚Üí  ‚Ñ§  ‚Üí  ùí™  ‚Üí   ùí™  *   ‚Üí  0       normal-‚Üí  0  ‚Ñ§    normal-‚Üí    ùí™    normal-‚Üí     superscript  ùí™      normal-‚Üí    0     0\to\mathbb{Z}\to\mathcal{O}\to\mathcal{O}^{*}\to 0   where the second map is    f  ‚Ü¶   exp   (   2  œÄ  i  f   )       maps-to  f      2  œÄ  i  f      f\mapsto\exp(2\pi if)   yields a homomorphism of groups:        Pic   (  X  )    ‚Üí    H  2    (  X  ,  ‚Ñ§  )     .     normal-‚Üí   Pic  X      superscript  H  2    X  ‚Ñ§      \operatorname{Pic}(X)\to H^{2}(X,\mathbb{Z}).   The image of a line bundle   ‚Ñí   ‚Ñí   \mathcal{L}   under this map is denoted by     c  1    (  ‚Ñí  )        subscript  c  1   ‚Ñí    c_{1}(\mathcal{L})   and is called the first Chern class of   ‚Ñí   ‚Ñí   \mathcal{L}   .  A divisor  D on X is a formal sum of hypersurfaces (subvariety of codimension one):       D  =   ‚àë    a  i    V  i      ,    a  i   ‚àà  ‚Ñ§      formulae-sequence    D       subscript  a  i    subscript  V  i         subscript  a  i   ‚Ñ§     D=\sum a_{i}V_{i},\quad a_{i}\in\mathbb{Z}   that is locally a finite sum. 1 The set of all divisors on X is denoted by    Div   (  X  )      Div  X    \operatorname{Div}(X)   . It can be canonically identified with     H  0    (  X  ,    ‚Ñ≥  *   /   ùí™  *    )        superscript  H  0    X     superscript  ‚Ñ≥     superscript  ùí™        H^{0}(X,\mathcal{M}^{*}/\mathcal{O}^{*})   . Taking the long exact sequence of the quotient     ‚Ñ≥  *   /   ùí™  *        superscript  ‚Ñ≥     superscript  ùí™      \mathcal{M}^{*}/\mathcal{O}^{*}   , one obtains a homomorphism:        Div   (  X  )    ‚Üí   Pic   (  X  )     .     normal-‚Üí   Div  X    Pic  X     \operatorname{Div}(X)\to\operatorname{Pic}(X).     A line bundle is said to be positive if its first Chern class is represented by a closed positive real    (  1  ,  1  )     1  1    (1,1)   -form. Equivalently, a line bundle is positive if it admits a hermitian structure such that the induced connection has Griffiths-positive curvature. A complex manifold admitting a positive line bundle is k√§hler .  The Kodaira embedding theorem states that a line bundle on a compact k√§hler manifold is positive if and only if it is ample .  Complex vector bundles  Let X be a differentiable manifold. The basic invariant of a complex vector bundle    œÄ  :   E  ‚Üí  X      normal-:  œÄ   normal-‚Üí  E  X     \pi:E\to X   is the Chern class of the bundle. By definition, it is a sequence     c  1   ,   c  2   ,  ‚Ä¶      subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2   normal-‚Ä¶    c_{1},c_{2},\dots   such that     c  i    (  E  )        subscript  c  i   E    c_{i}(E)   is an element of     H   2  i     (  X  ,  ‚Ñ§  )        superscript  H    2  i     X  ‚Ñ§     H^{2i}(X,\mathbb{Z})   and that satisfies the following axioms: 2         c  i    (    f  *    (  E  )    )    =    f  *    (    c  i    (  E  )    )           subscript  c  i      superscript  f    E       superscript  f       subscript  c  i   E      c_{i}(f^{*}(E))=f^{*}(c_{i}(E))   for any differentiable map    f  :   Z  ‚Üí  X      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  Z  X     f:Z\to X   .       c   (   E  ‚äï  F   )    =    c   (  E  )    ‚à™   c   (  F  )           c   direct-sum  E  F        c  E     c  F      c(E\oplus F)=c(E)\cup c(F)   where F is another bundle and     c  =   1  +   c  1   +   c  2   +  ‚Ä¶    .      c    1   subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2   normal-‚Ä¶     c=1+c_{1}+c_{2}+\dots.           c  i    (  E  )    =  0         subscript  c  i   E   0    c_{i}(E)=0   for    i  >   rk  E       i   rk  E     i>\operatorname{rk}E   .      -    c  1    (   E  1   )           subscript  c  1    subscript  E  1      -c_{1}(E_{1})   generates     H  2    (   ‚ÑÇ   ùêè  1    ,  ‚Ñ§  )        superscript  H  2      ‚ÑÇ   superscript  ùêè  1    ‚Ñ§     H^{2}(\mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^{1},\mathbb{Z})   where    E  1     subscript  E  1    E_{1}   is the canonical line bundle over    ‚ÑÇ   ùêè  1       ‚ÑÇ   superscript  ùêè  1     \mathbb{C}\mathbf{P}^{1}   .   If L is a line bundle, then the Chern character of L is given by       ch   (  L  )    =   e    c  1    (  L  )          ch  L    superscript  e     subscript  c  1   L      \operatorname{ch}(L)=e^{c_{1}(L)}   . More generally, if E is a vector bundle of rank r , then we have the formal factorization:     ‚àë    c  i    (  E  )    t  i     =    ‚àè  1  r    (   1  +    Œ∑  i   t    )             subscript  c  i   E   superscript  t  i       superscript   subscript  product  1   r     1     subscript  Œ∑  i   t       \sum c_{i}(E)t^{i}=\prod_{1}^{r}(1+\eta_{i}t)   and then we set       ch   (  E  )    =   ‚àë   e   Œ∑  i          ch  E      superscript  e   subscript  Œ∑  i       \operatorname{ch}(E)=\sum e^{\eta_{i}}   .  Methods from harmonic analysis  Some deep results in complex geometry are obtained with the aid of harmonic analysis.  Vanishing theorem  There are several versions of vanishing theorems in complex geometry for both compact and non-compact complex manifolds. They are however all based on the Bochner method .
