   Michael Saks (mathematician)      Michael Saks (mathematician)   Michael Ezra Saks is an American mathematician. He was (2006–2010) director of the Mathematics Graduate Program at Rutgers University . Saks received his Ph.D from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1980 after completing his dissertation entitled Duality Properties of Finite Set Systems  1 under his advisor Daniel J. Kleitman .  A list of his publications and collaborations may be found at. 2  Research  Saks research in computational complexity theory , combinatorics , and graph theory has contributed to the study of lower bounds in order theory , randomized computation , and space-time tradeoff .  In Kahn and Saks (1984) it was shown there exist a tight information-theoretical lower bound for sorting under partially ordered information up to a multiplicative constant. 3  In [ http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.114.5448&rep; ;=rep1&type;=pdf] the first super-linear lower bound for the noisy broadcast problem was proved. In a noisy broadcast model,    n  +  1      n  1    n+1   processors     P  0   ,   P  1   ,  …  ,   P  n       subscript  P  0    subscript  P  1   normal-…   subscript  P  n     P_{0},P_{1},\ldots,P_{n}   are assigned a local input bit    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   . Each processor may perform a noisy broadcast to all other processors where the received bits may be independently flipped with a fixed probability. The problem is for processor    P  0     subscript  P  0    P_{0}   to determined    f   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )       f    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      f(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})   for some function   f   f   f   . Saks et al. showed that an existing protocol by Gallager was indeed optimal by a reduction from a generalized noisy decision tree and produced a    Ω   (   n   log   (  n  )     )       normal-Ω    n    n      \Omega(n\log(n))   lower bound on the depth of the tree that learns the input. 4  In Beame et al. (2003) the first time-space lower bound trade-off for randomized computation of decision problems was proved. 5  Positions  Saks holds positions in the following journal editorial boards:   SIAM J. on Computing, Associate Editor  Combinatorica, Editorial Board member  Journal of Graph Theory, Editorial Board member  Discrete Applied Mathematics, Editorial Board member   References  External links     "  Category:Living people  Category:Rutgers University faculty  Category:Gödel Prize laureates  Category:Massachusetts Institute of Technology alumni  Category:Theoretical computer scientists     http://en.scientificcommons.org/2859536 ↩  http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/indices/a-tree/s/Saks:Michael_E =.html ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
