   Discrete spline interpolation      Discrete spline interpolation   In the mathematical field of numerical analysis , discrete spline interpolation is a form of interpolation where the interpolant is a special type of piecewise  polynomial called a discrete spline. A discrete spline is a piecewise polynomial such that its central differences are continuous at the knots whereas a spline is a piecewise polynomial such that its derivatives are continuous at the knots. Discrete cubic splines are discrete splines where the central differences of orders 0, 1, and 2 are required to be continuous. 1  Discrete splines were introduced by Mangasarin and Schumaker in 1971 as solutions of certain minimization problems involving differences. 2  Discrete cubic splines  Let x 1 , x 2 , . . ., x n -1 be an increasing set of real numbers. Let g ( x ) be a piecewise polynomial defined by        g   i  +  1     (    x  i   -  h   )    =    g  i    (    x  i   -  h   )           subscript  g    i  1       subscript  x  i   h       subscript  g  i      subscript  x  i   h      g_{i+1}(x_{i}-h)=g_{i}(x_{i}-h)     then g ( x ) is called a discrete cubic spline. 3  Alternative formulation 1  The conditions defining a discrete cubic spline are equivalent to the following:        g   i  +  1     (   x  i   )    =    g  i    (   x  i   )           subscript  g    i  1     subscript  x  i       subscript  g  i    subscript  x  i      g_{i+1}(x_{i})=g_{i}(x_{i})           g   i  +  1     (    x  i   +  h   )    =    g  i    (    x  i   +  h   )           subscript  g    i  1       subscript  x  i   h       subscript  g  i      subscript  x  i   h      g_{i+1}(x_{i}+h)=g_{i}(x_{i}+h)           D   (  0  )    f   (  x  )    =   f   (  x  )           superscript  D  0   f  x     f  x     D^{(0)}f(x)=f(x)     Alternative formulation 2  The central differences of orders 0, 1, and 2 of a function f ( x ) are defined as follows:        D   (  1  )    f   (  x  )    =     f   (   x  +  h   )    -   f   (   x  -  h   )      2  h           superscript  D  1   f  x         f    x  h      f    x  h       2  h      D^{(1)}f(x)=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x-h)}{2h}           D   (  2  )    f   (  x  )    =      f   (   x  +  h   )    -   2  f   (  x  )     +   f   (   x  -  h   )      h  2           superscript  D  2   f  x           f    x  h      2  f  x      f    x  h      superscript  h  2      D^{(2)}f(x)=\frac{f(x+h)-2f(x)+f(x-h)}{h^{2}}            D   (  j  )     g   i  +  1     (   x  i   )    =    D   (  j  )     g  i    (   x  i   )   for  j   =  0   ,    1  ,   2  and  i    =  1   ,   2  ,  …  ,   n  -  1.       formulae-sequence         superscript  D  j    subscript  g    i  1     subscript  x  i       superscript  D  j    subscript  g  i    subscript  x  i   for  j        0       1    2  and  i    1    2  normal-…    n  1.

The conditions defining a discrete cubic spline are also equivalent to 4       D   (  j  )    g   (  x  )        superscript  D  j   g  x    D^{(j)}g(x)     This states that the central differences     g   (  x  )    =   {      x  3      x  <  1         x  3   -   2   (   x  -  1   )    (     (   x  -  1   )   2   -   h  2    )        1  ≤  x  <  2          x  3   -   2   (   x  -  1   )    (     (   x  -  1   )   2   -   h  2    )     +    (   x  -  2   )    (     (   x  -  2   )   2   -   h  2    )        x  ≥  2             g  x    cases   superscript  x  3     x  1      superscript  x  3     2    x  1      superscript    x  1   2    superscript  h  2          1  x       2         superscript  x  3     2    x  1      superscript    x  1   2    superscript  h  2          x  2      superscript    x  2   2    superscript  h  2        x  2      g(x)=\begin{cases}x^{3}&x<1\\

 x^{3}-2(x-1)((x-1)^{2}-h^{2})+(x-2)((x-2)^{2}-h^{2})&x\geq 2\end{cases}   are continuous at x ''i .  Example  Let x 1 = 1 and x 2 = 2 so that n = 3. The following function defines a discrete cubic spline: 5        g   (   x  i   )    =   f   (   x  i   )   for  i   =  0   ,   1  ,  …  ,  n    .     formulae-sequence        g   subscript  x  i      f   subscript  x  i   for  i        0     1  normal-…  n     g(x_{i})=f(x_{i})\text{ for }i=0,1,\ldots,n.     Discrete cubic spline interpolant  Let x 0 1 and x n > x n -1 and f ( x ) be a function defined in the closed interval [ x 0 - h, x ''n '' + h]. Then there is a unique cubic discrete spline g ( x ) satisfying the following conditions:         D   (  1  )     g  1    (   x  0   )    =    D   (  1  )    f   (   x  0   )     .         superscript  D  1    subscript  g  1    subscript  x  0       superscript  D  1   f   subscript  x  0      D^{(1)}g_{1}(x_{0})=D^{(1)}f(x_{0}).            D   (  1  )     g  n    (   x  n   )    =    D   (  1  )    f   (   x  n   )     .         superscript  D  1    subscript  g  n    subscript  x  n       superscript  D  1   f   subscript  x  n      D^{(1)}g_{n}(x_{n})=D^{(1)}f(x_{n}).     $$D^{(1)}g_n(x_n) = D^{(1)}f(x_n).$$  This unique discrete cubic spline is the discrete spline interpolant to f ( x ) in the interval [ x 0 - h, x ''n '' + h]. This interpolant agrees with the values of f ( x ) at x 0 , x 1 , . . ., x n .  Applications   Discrete cubic splines were originally introduced as solutions of certain minimization problems. 6 7  They have applications in computing nonlinear splines. 8 9  They are used to obtain approximate solution of a second order boundary value problem. 10  Discret interpolatory splines have been used tNov 2001 construct biorthogonal wavelets. 11   References  "  Category:Interpolation  Category:Splines     ↩  ↩        ↩  ↩  ↩
