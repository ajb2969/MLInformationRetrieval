Discrete spline interpolation

In the mathematical field of numerical analysis, discrete spline interpolation is a form of interpolation where the interpolant is a special type of piecewise polynomial called a discrete spline. A discrete spline is a piecewise polynomial such that its central differences are continuous at the knots whereas a spline is a piecewise polynomial such that its derivatives are continuous at the knots. Discrete cubic splines are discrete splines where the central differences of orders 0, 1, and 2 are required to be continuous.1
Discrete splines were introduced by Mangasarin and Schumaker in 1971 as solutions of certain minimization problems involving differences.2
Discrete cubic splines
Let x1, x2, . . ., xn-1 be an increasing set of real numbers. Let g(x) be a piecewise polynomial defined by



then g(x) is called a discrete cubic spline.3
Alternative formulation 1
The conditions defining a discrete cubic spline are equivalent to the following:









Alternative formulation 2
The central differences of orders 0, 1, and 2 of a function f(x) are defined as follows:









The conditions defining a discrete cubic spline are also equivalent to4



This states that the central differences 
 
 
 
  are continuous at x''i.
Example
Let x1 = 1 and x2 = 2 so that n = 3. The following function defines a discrete cubic spline:5


Discrete cubic spline interpolant
Let x0 1 and xn > xn-1 and f(x) be a function defined in the closed interval [x0 - h, x''n'' + h]. Then there is a unique cubic discrete spline g(x) satisfying the following conditions:






$$D^{(1)}g_n(x_n) = D^{(1)}f(x_n).$$
This unique discrete cubic spline is the discrete spline interpolant to f(x) in the interval [x0 - h, x''n'' + h]. This interpolant agrees with the values of f(x) at x0, x1, . . ., xn.
Applications

Discrete cubic splines were originally introduced as solutions of certain minimization problems.67
They have applications in computing nonlinear splines.89
They are used to obtain approximate solution of a second order boundary value problem.10
Discret interpolatory splines have been used tNov 2001 construct biorthogonal wavelets.11
