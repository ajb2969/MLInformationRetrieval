Indicator vector

In mathematics, the indicator vector or characteristic vector or incidence vector of a subset T of a set S is the vector 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 

If S is countable and its elements are numbered so that 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 

To put it more simply, the indicator vector of T is a vector with one element for each element in S, with that element being one if the corresponding element of S is in T, and zero if it is not.123
An indicator vector is a special (countable) case of an indicator function.
