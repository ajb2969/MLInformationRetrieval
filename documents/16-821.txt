   Indicator vector      Indicator vector   In mathematics, the indicator vector or characteristic vector or incidence vector of a subset  T of a set  S is the vector     x  T   :=    (   x  s   )    s  ∈  S       assign   subscript  x  T    subscript   subscript  x  s     s  S      x_{T}:=(x_{s})_{s\in S}   such that     x  s   =  1       subscript  x  s   1    x_{s}=1   if    s  ∈  T      s  T    s\in T   and     x  s   =  0       subscript  x  s   0    x_{s}=0   if     s  ∉  T   .      s  T    s\notin T.     If S is countable and its elements are numbered so that    S  =   {   s  1   ,   s  2   ,  …  ,   s  n   }       S    subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-…   subscript  s  n      S=\{s_{1},s_{2},\ldots,s_{n}\}   , then     x  T   =   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )        subscript  x  T     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      x_{T}=(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})   where     x  i   =  1       subscript  x  i   1    x_{i}=1   if     s  i   ∈  T       subscript  s  i   T    s_{i}\in T   and     x  i   =  0       subscript  x  i   0    x_{i}=0   if      s  i   ∉  T   .       subscript  s  i   T    s_{i}\notin T.     To put it more simply, the indicator vector of T is a vector with one element for each element in S , with that element being one if the corresponding element of S is in T , and zero if it is not. 1 2 3  An indicator vector is a special (countable) case of an indicator function .
