   Flavonol synthase      Flavonol synthase   In enzymology , a flavonol synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the following chemical reaction :  dihydroflavonol + 2-oxoglutarate +   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a flavonol + succinate + C + H 2 O  The 3 substrates of this enzyme are dihydroflavonol , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 4 products are flavonol , succinate , CO 2 , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with  as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from  with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom of oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dihydroflavonol,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis .
