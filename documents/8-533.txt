The lines with the arrows show the direction of the contracting and expanding eigenspaces   In mathematics , Arnold's cat map is a chaotic map from the torus into itself, named after Vladimir Arnold , who demonstrated its effects in the 1960s using an image of a cat, hence the name. 1  Thinking of the torus    ùïã  2     superscript  ùïã  2    \mathbb{T}^{2}   as the quotient space      ‚Ñù  2   /   ‚Ñ§  2        superscript  ‚Ñù  2    superscript  ‚Ñ§  2     \mathbb{R}^{2}/\mathbb{Z}^{2}   Arnold's cat map is the transformation    Œì  :    ùïã  2   ‚Üí   ùïã  2       normal-:  normal-Œì   normal-‚Üí   superscript  ùïã  2    superscript  ùïã  2      \Gamma:\mathbb{T}^{2}\to\mathbb{T}^{2}   given by the formula       Œì   :    (  x  ,  y  )   ‚Üí    (    2  x   +  y   ,   x  +  y   )   mod  1.       normal-:  normal-Œì   normal-‚Üí   x  y    modulo       2  x   y     x  y    1.      \Gamma\,:\,(x,y)\to(2x+y,x+y)\bmod 1.     Equivalently, in matrix notation, this is       Œì   (   [     x      y     ]   )    =     [     2    1      1    1     ]    [     x      y     ]    mod  1   =     [     1    1      0    1     ]    [     1    0      1    1     ]    [     x      y     ]    mod  1.           normal-Œì    x    y      modulo      2  1    1  1      x    y     1         modulo      1  1    0  1      1  0    1  1      x    y     1.      \Gamma\left(\begin{bmatrix}x\\
 y\end{bmatrix}\right)=\begin{bmatrix}2&1\\
 1&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\
 y\end{bmatrix}\bmod 1=\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\
 0&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
 1&1\end{bmatrix}\begin{bmatrix}x\\
 y\end{bmatrix}\bmod 1.     That is, with a unit size equal to the width of the square image, the image is sheared one unit up, then one unit to the right, and all that lies outside that unit square is shifted back by the unit until it's within the square.  Properties   Œì is invertible because the matrix has determinant 1 and therefore its inverse has integer entries ,  Œì is area preserving ,  Œì has a unique hyperbolic fixed point (the vertices of the square). The linear transformation which defines the map is hyperbolic: its eigenvalues are irrational numbers, one greater and the other smaller than 1 (in absolute value), so they are associated respectively to an expanding and a contracting eigenspace which are also the stable and unstable manifolds . The eigenspace are orthogonal because the matrix is symmetric . Since the eigenvectors have rationally independent components both the eigenspaces densely cover the torus. Arnold's cat map is a particularly well-known example of a hyperbolic toral automorphism , which is an automorphism of a torus given by a square unimodular matrix having no eigenvalues of absolute value 1. 2  The set of the points with a periodic orbit is dense on the torus. Actually a point is preperiodic if and only if its coordinates are rational .  Œì is topologically transitive (i.e. there is a point whose orbit is dense , this happens for example for any points on the expanding eigenspace )  The number of points with period n is exactly |Œª 1 n +¬†Œª 2 n ‚àí2| (where Œª 1 and Œª 2 are the eigenvalues of the matrix). For example, the first few terms of this series are 1, 5, 16, 45, 121, 320, 841, 2205 .... 3 (The same equation holds for any unimodular hyperbolic toral automorphism if the eigenvalues are replaced.)  Œì is ergodic and mixing ,  Œì is an Anosov diffeomorphism and in particular it is structurally stable .   The discrete cat map    It is possible to define a discrete analogue of the cat map. One of this map's features is that image being apparently randomized by the transformation but returning to its original state after a number of steps. As can be seen in the picture to the right, the original image of the cat is sheared and then wrapped around in the first iteration of the transformation. After some iterations, the resulting image appears rather random or disordered, yet after further iterations the image appears to have further order‚Äîghost-like images of the cat, multiple smaller copies arranged in a repeating structure and even upside-down copies of the original image‚Äîand ultimately returns to the original image.  The discrete cat map describes the phase space flow corresponding to the discrete dynamics of a bead hopping from site q t (0 ‚â§ q t t+1 on a circular ring with circumference N , according to the second order equation :         q   t  +  1    -   3   q  t     +   q   t  -  1     =   0  mod  N            subscript  q    t  1      3   subscript  q  t      subscript  q    t  1      modulo  0  N     q_{t+1}-3q_{t}+q_{t-1}=0\mod N     Defining the momentum variable p t = q t - q t-1 , the above second order dynamics can be re-written as a mapping of the square 0 ‚â§ q , p q_{t+1} = 2q_{t} + p_{t} \mod N       p   t  +  1    =     q  t   +   p  t    mod  N        subscript  p    t  1     modulo     subscript  q  t    subscript  p  t    N     p_{t+1}=q_{t}+p_{t}\mod N     This Arnold cat mapping shows mixing behavior typical for chaotic systems. However, since the transformation has a determinant equal to unity, it is area-preserving and therefore invertible the inverse transformation being:       q   t  -  1    =     q  t   -   p  t    mod  N        subscript  q    t  1     modulo     subscript  q  t    subscript  p  t    N     q_{t-1}=q_{t}-p_{t}\mod N          p   t  -  1    =     -   q  t    +   2   p  t     mod  N        subscript  p    t  1     modulo       subscript  q  t      2   subscript  p  t     N     p_{t-1}=-q_{t}+2p_{t}\mod N     For real variables q and p , it is common to set N = 1. In that case a mapping of the unit square with periodic boundary conditions onto itself results.  When N is set to an integer value, the position and momentum variables can be restricted to integers and the mapping becomes a mapping of a toroidial square grid of points onto itself. Such an integer cat map is commonly used to demonstrate mixing behavior with Poincar√© recurrence utilising digital images. The number of iterations needed to restore the image can be shown never to exceed 3N. 4  For an image, the relationship between iterations could be expressed as follows:          n  =  0   :        T  0    (  x  ,  y  )      =     Input Image   (  x  ,  y  )          n  =  1   :        T  1    (  x  ,  y  )      =      T  0    (  mod   (  2  x  +  y  ,  N  )   ,  mod   (  x  +  y  ,  N  )   )          ‚ãÆ         n  =  k   :        T  k    (  x  ,  y  )      =      T   k  -  1     (  mod   (  2  x  +  y  ,  N  )   ,  mod   (  x  +  y  ,  N  )   )          ‚ãÆ         n  =  m   :       Output Image   (  x  ,  y  )      =      T  m    (  x  ,  y  )           normal-:    n  0   absent      superscript  T  0    x  y       Input Image   x  y       normal-:    n  1   absent      superscript  T  1    x  y      fragments   superscript  T  0    fragments  normal-(  modulo   fragments  normal-(  2  x   y  normal-,  N  normal-)   normal-,  modulo   fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-,  N  normal-)   normal-)       missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression   normal-‚ãÆ   missing-subexpression      normal-:    n  k   absent      superscript  T  k    x  y      fragments   superscript  T    k  1     fragments  normal-(  modulo   fragments  normal-(  2  x   y  normal-,  N  normal-)   normal-,  modulo   fragments  normal-(  x   y  normal-,  N  normal-)   normal-)       missing-subexpression    missing-subexpression   normal-‚ãÆ   missing-subexpression      normal-:    n  m   absent     Output Image   x  y        superscript  T  m    x  y       \begin{array}[]{rrcl}n=0:&T^{0}(x,y)&=&\mbox{Input Image}(x,y)\\
