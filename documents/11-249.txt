Synephrine dehydratase




Synephrine dehydratase

In enzymology, a synephrine dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)ethanol 
 
 
 
  (4-hydroxyphenyl)acetaldehyde + methylamine
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)ethanol (synephrine), and two products, 4-hydroxyphenylacetaldehyde and methylamine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(4-hydroxyphenyl)-2-(methylamino)ethanol hydro-lyase (methylamine-forming).
