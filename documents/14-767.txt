Brake specific fuel consumption

Brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) is a measure of the fuel efficiency of any prime mover that burns fuel and produces rotational, or shaft, power. It is typically used for comparing the efficiency of internal combustion engines with a shaft output.
It is the rate of fuel consumption divided by the power produced. It may also be thought of as power-specific fuel consumption, for this reason. BSFC allows the fuel efficiency of different engines to be directly compared.
The BSFC calculation (in metric units)
To calculate BSFC, use the formula



where:

r is the fuel consumption rate in grams per second (g/s)
 
P is the power produced in watts where 
 
 


 
  is the engine speed in radians per second (rad/s)


 
  is the engine torque in newton meters (N·m)


The above values of r, 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  may be readily measured by instrumentation with an engine mounted in a test stand and a load applied to the running engine. The resulting units of BSFC are grams per joule (g/J)
Commonly BSFC is expressed in units of grams per kilowatt-hour (g/(kW·h)). The conversion factor is as follows:

BSFC [g/(kW·h)] = BSFC [g/J]×(3.6×106)
 

The conversion between metric and imperial units is:

BSFC [g/(kW·h)] = BSFC [lb/(hp·h)]×608.277
 
BSFC [lb/(hp·h)] = BSFC [g/(kW·h)]×0.001644
 

The relationship between BSFC numbers and efficiency
To calculate the actual efficiency of an engine requires the energy density of the fuel being used.
Different fuels have different energy densities defined by the fuel's heating value. The lower heating value (LHV) is used for internal combustion engine efficiency calculations because the heat at temperatures below  cannot be put to use.
Some examples of lower heating values for vehicle fuels are:


Certification gasoline = 18,640 BTU/lb (0.01204 kW·h/g)
 
Regular gasoline = 18,917 BTU/lb (0.0122225 kW·h/g)
 
Diesel fuel = 18,500 BTU/lb (0.0119531 kW·h/g)
 



Thus a diesel engine's efficiency = 1/(BSFC × 0.0119531) and a gasoline engine's efficiency = 1/(BSFC × 0.0122225)
The use of BSFC numbers as operating values and as a cycle average statistic
 Any engine will have different BSFC values at different speeds and loads. For example, a reciprocating engine achieves maximum efficiency when the intake air is unthrottled and the engine is running near its torque peak. However, the numbers often reported for a particular engine are a fuel economy cycle average statistic. For example, the cycle average value of BSFC for a gasoline engine is 322 g/kW·h, translating to an efficiency of 25% (math calculation: 1/(322 × 0.0122225) = 0.2540). However, efficiency for that engine can be lower or higher than this average statistic depending on the operating condition. In the case of a production gasoline engine, the most efficient BSFC is approximately 225 g/kW·h, which is equivalent to a thermodynamic efficiency of 36%.
An iso-BSFC map (AKA fuel island plot) of a diesel engine is shown. The sweet spot at 206 BSFC has 40.6% efficiency. x-axis is rpm, y-axis is BMEP in bar (bmep is proportional to torque)
The significance of BSFC numbers for engine design and class
BSFC numbers change a lot for different engine design and compression ratio and power rating. Engines of different classes like diesels and gasoline engines will have very different BSFC numbers, ranging from less than 200 g/kW·h (diesel at low speed and high torque) to more than 1,000 g/kW·h (turboprop at low power level).
Examples of values of BSFC for shaft engines
The following table takes selected values as an example for the minimum specific fuel consumption of several types of engine.

Turboprop (aircraft engine) values are given for the complete range of power during a flight.
Ground roll SFC value (at 0.07 Pmax) and especially idle (at rest) SFC values show dramatic increases when compared with cruise value (0.70 Pmax).1

For specific engines values can and often do differ from the table values shown below. For comparison, the theoretical work that can be derived from burning octane (C8H18) (based on change in Gibbs free energy going to gaseous H2O and CO2) is 45.7 MJ/kg, corresponding to 79 g/kW·h.
