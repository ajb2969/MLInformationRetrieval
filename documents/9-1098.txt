   Parity-check matrix      Parity-check matrix   In coding theory , a parity-check matrix of a linear block code  C is a matrix which describes the linear relations that the components of a codeword must satisfy. It can be used to decide whether a particular vector is a codeword and is also used in decoding algorithms.  Definition  Formally, a parity check matrix, H of a linear code C is a generator matrix of the dual code , C ⊥ . This means that a codeword c is in ''C if and only if the matrix-vector product (some authors 1 would write this in an equivalent form, c H'' ⊤ = 0 .)  The rows of a parity check matrix are the coefficients of the parity check equations. 2 That is, they show how linear combinations of certain digits (components) of each codeword equal zero. For example, the parity check matrix      H  =   [     0    0    1    1      1    1    0    0     ]       H   delimited-[]    0  0  1  1    1  1  0  0       H=\par

Creating a parity check matrix  The parity check matrix for a given code can be derived from its generator matrix (and vice versa). 3 If the generator matrix for an [ n , k ]-code is in standard form      G  =   [       I  k   |  P      ]       G     fragments   subscript  I  k   normal-|  P       G=\begin{bmatrix}I_{k}|P\end{bmatrix}   , then the parity check matrix is given by      H  =   [      -   P  ⊤   |   I   n  -  k        ]       H     fragments    superscript  P  top   normal-|   subscript  I    n  k         H=\begin{bmatrix}-P^{\top}|I_{n-k}\end{bmatrix}   , because       G   H  ⊤    =   P  -  P   =  0          G   superscript  H  top      P  P        0     GH^{\top}=P-P=0   . Negation is performed in the finite field F q . Note that if the characteristic of the underlying field is 2 (i.e., 1 + 1 = 0 in that field), as in binary codes , then - P = P , so the negation is unnecessary.  For example, if a binary code has the generator matrix      G  =   [     1    0    1    0    1      0    1    1    1    0     ]       G   delimited-[]    1  0  1  0  1    0  1  1  1  0       G=\left[\begin{array}[]{cc|ccc}1&0&1&0&1\\

 \end{array}\right]   ,  then its parity check matrix is      H  =   [     1    1    1    0    0      0    1    0    1    0      1    0    0    0    1     ]       H   delimited-[]    1  1  1  0  0    0  1  0  1  0    1  0  0  0  1       H=\left[\begin{array}[]{cc|ccc}1&1&1&0&0\\
 0&1&0&1&0\\
 1&0&0&0&1\\
 \end{array}\right]   .  Syndromes  For any (row) vector x of the ambient vector space, s = H x ⊤ is called the syndrome of x . The vector x is a codeword if and only if s = 0 . The calculation of syndromes is the basis for the syndrome decoding algorithm. 4  See also   Hamming code   Notes  References        "  Category:Coding theory     for instance, ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
