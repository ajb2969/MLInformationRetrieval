   Anthocyanin 3'-O-beta-glucosyltransferase      Anthocyanin 3'-O-beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , an anthocyanin 3'-O-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + an anthocyanin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + an anthocyanin 3'-O-beta-D-glucoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and anthocyanin , whereas its two products are UDP and anthocyanin 3'-O-beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:anthocyanin 3'-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include UDP-glucose:anthocyanin 3'-O-glucosyltransferase , and 3'GT .  References     "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
