Carlson symmetric form

In mathematics, the Carlson symmetric forms of elliptic integrals are a small canonical set of elliptic integrals to which all others may be reduced. They are a modern alternative to the Legendre forms. The Legendre forms may be expressed in terms of the Carlson forms and vice versa.
The Carlson elliptic integrals are:












Since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are special cases of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , all elliptic integrals can ultimately be evaluated in terms of just 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The term symmetric refers to the fact that in contrast to the Legendre forms, these functions are unchanged by the exchange of certain of their arguments. The value of 
 
 
 
  is the same for any permutation of its arguments, and the value of 
 
 
 
  is the same for any permutation of its first three arguments.
The Carlson elliptic integrals are named after Bille C. Carlson.
Relation to the Legendre forms
Incomplete elliptic integrals
Incomplete elliptic integrals can be calculated easily using Carlson symmetric forms:









(Note: the above are only valid for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 )
Complete elliptic integrals
Complete elliptic integrals can be calculated by substituting φ = 
 
 
 
 π:









Special cases
When any two, or all three of the arguments of 
 
 
 
  are the same, then a substitution of 
 
 
 
  renders the integrand rational. The integral can then be expressed in terms of elementary transcendental functions.



Similarly, when at least two of the first three arguments of 
 
 
 
  are the same,

Series Expansion
In obtaining a Taylor series expansion for 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  it proves convenient to expand about the mean value of the several arguments. So for 
 
 
 
 , letting the mean value of the arguments be 
 
 
 
 , and using homogeneity, define 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by

  etc. The differences 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are defined with this sign (such that they are subtracted), in order to be in agreement with Carlson's papers. Since 
 
 
 
  is symmetric under permutation of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 , it is also symmetric in the quantities 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . It follows that both the integrand of 
 
 
 
  and its integral can be expressed as functions of the elementary symmetric polynomials in 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which are

The advantage of expanding about the mean value of the arguments is now apparent; it reduces 
 
 
 
  identically to zero, and so eliminates all terms involving 
 
 
 
  - which otherwise would be the most numerous.
An ascending series for 
 
 
 
  may be found in a similar way. There is a slight difficulty because 
 
 
 
  is not fully symmetric; its dependence on its fourth argument, 
 
 
 
 , is different from its dependence on 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This is overcome by treating 
 
 
 
  as a fully symmetric function of five arguments, two of which happen to have the same value 
 
 
 
 . The mean value of the arguments is therefore take to be

As with 
 
 
 
 , by expanding about the mean value of the arguments, more than half the terms (those involving 
 
 
 
 
 ) are eliminated.
Negative arguments
In general, the arguments x, y, z of Carlson's integrals may not be real and negative, as this would place a branch point on the path of integration, making the integral ambiguous. However, if the second argument of 
 
 
 
 , or the fourth argument, p, of 
 
 
 
  is negative, then this results in a simple pole on the path of integration. In these cases the Cauchy principal value (finite part) of the integrals may be of interest; these are

which must be greater than zero for 
 
 
 
  to be evaluated. This may be arranged by permuting x, y and z so that the value of y is between that of x and z.
Numerical evaluation
The duplication theorem can be used for a fast and robust evaluation of the Carlson symmetric form of elliptic integrals and therefore also for the evaluation of Legendre-form of elliptic integrals. Let us calculate 
 
 
 
 : first, define 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Then iterate the series





 
  until the desired precision is reached: if 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are non-negative, all of the series will converge quickly to a given value, say, 
 
 
 
 . Therefore,



Note: for complex arguments and MATLAB use 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
  to get the correct values because of the complex square root branch choice ambiguity.
