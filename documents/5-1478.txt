   Emergy      Emergy   Emergy is a type of available energy ( exergy ) that is consumed in direct and indirect transformations needed to make a product or service. 1  Emergy accounts for, and is, therefore, in effect a measure of quality differences between different forms of energy. Emergy is an expression of all the energy used in the work processes that generate a product or service in units of one type of energy. Emergy is measured in units of emjoule s, a unit referring to the available energy of one kind consumed in transformations. Emergy accounts for different forms of energy and resources (e.g. sunlight, water, fossil fuels, minerals, etc.) Each form is generated by transformation processes in nature and each has a different ability to support work in natural and human dominated systems. The recognition of these differences in quality is a key concept of the emergy methodology.  History  The theoretical and conceptual basis for the emergy methodology is grounded in thermodynamics , general system theory 2 and systems ecology . 3 Evolution of the theory by Howard T. Odum over the first thirty years is reviewed in Environmental Accounting 4 and in the volume edited by C.A.S. Hall titled Maximum Power . 5  Background  Beginning in the 1950s, Odum analyzed energy flow in ecosystems ( e.g. . Silver Springs, Florida; 6 Eniwetok atoll in the south Pacific; 7 Galveston Bay, Texas 8 and Puerto Rican rainforests, 9 amongst others) where energies of many different forms at many different scales were observed. His analysis of energy flow in ecosystems and the differences in the potential energy of sunlight, fresh water currents, wind and ocean currents led him to make the suggestion that when two or more different energy sources drive a system they cannot be added without first converting them to a common measure that accounts for their differences in energy quality . This led him to introduce the concept of "energy of one kind" as a common denominator with the name "energy cost". 10 He then expanded the analysis to model food production in the 1960s, 11 and in the 1970s to fossil fuels . 12 Odum, H.T. and E.C. Odum. 1976. Energy Basis for Man and Nature . McGraw-Hill, NY. 297 pp  Odum's first formal statement of what would later be termed emergy was in 1973:    Energy is measured by calories, btu ’s, kilowatthours, and other intraconvertable units, but energy has a scale of quality which is not indicated by these measures. The ability to do work for man depends on the energy quality and quantity and this is measurable by the amount of energy of a lower quality grade required to develop the higher grade. The scale of energy goes from dilute sunlight up to plant matter, to coal, from coal to oil, to electricity and up to the high quality efforts of computer and human information processing . 13    In 1975 he introduced a table of “Energy Quality Factors”, kilocalories of sunlight energy required to make a kilocalorie of a higher quality energy, 14 the first mention of the energy hierarchy principle which states that “energy quality is measured by the energy used in the transformations” from one type of energy to the next.  These energy quality factors, were placed on a fossil-fuel basis and called "Fossil Fuel Work Equivalents" (FFWE), and the quality of energies were measured based on a fossil fuel standard with rough equivalents of 1 kilocalorie of fossil fuel equal to 2000 kilocalories of sunlight. "Energy quality ratios" were computed by evaluating the quantity of energy in a transformation process to make a new form and were then used to convert different forms of energy to a common form, in this case fossil fuel equivalents. FFWE's were replaced with Coal equivalents (CE) and by 1977, the system of evaluating quality was placed on a solar basis and termed solar equivalents (SE). 15  Embodied energy  The term " embodied energy " was used for a time in the early 1980s to refer to energy quality differences in terms of their costs of generation, and a ratio called a “quality factor” for the calories (or joules) of one kind of energy required to make those of another. 16 However, since the term embodied energy was used by other groups who were evaluating the fossil fuel energy required to generate products and were not including all energies or using the concept to imply quality, embodied energy was dropped in favor of “embodied solar calories” and the quality factors became known as "transformation ratios".  Introduction of the term "emergy"  Use of the term "embodied energy" for this concept was modified in 1986 when David Scienceman , a visiting scholar at the University of Florida from Australia, suggested the term “emergy” and "emjoule" or "emcalorie" as the unit of measure to distinguish emergy units from units of available energy. 17 The term transformation ratio was shortened to transformity in about the same time. It is important to note that throughout this twenty years the baseline or the basis for evaluating forms of energy and resources shifted from organic matter, to fossil fuels and finally to solar energy.  Between 1986 and today, the emergy methodology has continued to develop as the community of scientists has expanded and as new applied research into combined systems of humans and nature has presented new conceptual and theoretical questions. The maturing of the emergy methodology has resulted in more rigorous definitions of terms and nomenclature and refinement of the methods of calculating transformities. There is now an International Society for the Advancement of Emergy Research and a biennial International Conference held on the campus of the University of Florida.  Chronology  The following table is a chronology of the evolution of the emergy methodology and nomenclature providing a brief insight into the development of the concept.      Table 1: Development chronology of emergy, transformity, and conversion ratios.     Years     1967–1971     1973–1980     1980–1982     1983–1986     1987–2000     2000–present     Definitions and examples  Given next are definitions of most important terms used in the emergy methodology.  Emergy is the available energy of one form that is used up in transformations directly and indirectly to make a product or service. The unit of emergy is the emjoule or emergy joule. Using emergy, sunlight, fuel, electricity, and human service can be put on a common basis by expressing each of them in the emjoules of solar energy that is required to produce them. If solar emergy is the baseline, then the results are solar emjoules (abbreviated seJ). Although other baselines have been used, such as coal emjoules or electrical emjoules, in most cases emergy data are given in solar emjoules.  ' 'Unit Emergy Values (UEVs) '' are computed based on the emergy required to generate one unit of output from a process. There are several types of UEVs, as follows:   Transformity — the emergy input per unit of available energy output . For example, if 10,000 solar emjoules are required to generate a joule of wood, then the solar transformity of that wood is 10,000 solar emjoules per joule (abbreviated seJ/J). The solar transformity of the sunlight absorbed by the earth is 1.0 by definition.    Specific emergy — the emergy per unit mass output. Specific emergy is usually expressed as solar emergy per gram (seJ/g). Material resources may best be evaluated with data on emergy per unit mass. Because energy is required to concentrate materials, the unit emergy value of any substance increases with concentration. Elements and compounds not abundant in nature therefore have higher emergy/mass ratios when found in concentrated form since more environmental work was required to concentrate them, both spatially and chemically.    Emergy per unit money — the emergy supporting the generation of one unit of economic product (expressed as currency). It is used to convert money payments into emergy units. Since money is paid to people for their services and not to the environment, the contribution to a process represented by monetary payments is the emergy that people purchase with the money. The amount of resources that money buys depends on the amount of emergy supporting the economy and the amount of money circulating. An average emergy/money ratio in solar emjoules/$ can be calculated by dividing the total emergy use of a state or nation by its gross economic product. It varies by country and has been shown to decrease each year, which is one index of inflation. This emergy/money ratio is useful for evaluating service inputs given in money units where an average wage rate is appropriate.    Emergy per unit labor — the amount of emergy supporting one unit of labor directly supplied to a process. Laborers apply their work to a process and in so doing they indirectly invest in it the whole emergy that made their labor possible (food, training, transport, etc). This emergy intensity is generally expressed as emergy per time (seJ/yr; seJ/hr), but emergy per money earned (seJ/$) is also used. Indirect labor required to make and supply the inputs to a process is generally measured as dollar cost of services, so that its emergy intensity is calculated as seJ/$.    Empower — a flow of emergy (i.e., emergy per unit time). Emergy flows are usually expressed in units of solar empower (solar emjoules per time, seJ/s, seJ/yr).   Nomenclature  To avoid confusion with other forms of analysis and to rigorously define concepts, an emergy nomenclature has been developed that defines terms, units, and ratios used in emergy evaluations. The following table shows terms, abbreviations, definitions and units related to emergy, summarized from the literature.      Table 2.

To evaluate a system, first a system diagram is drawn to organize the evaluation and account for all inputs and outflows. A table of the actual flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram and all flows are evaluated. The final step of an emergy evaluation involves interpreting the quantitative results. In some cases, the evaluation is done to determine the fit of a development proposal within its environment. In others, it may be a question of comparing different alternatives, or the evaluation may be seeking the best use of resources to maximize economic vitality (Table 4, below lists some of the many published emergy evaluations of systems and processes).  Emergy evaluations are both synthetic and analytic. Synthesis is the act of combining elements into coherent wholes for understanding of the wholeness of systems, while analysis is the dissection or breaking apart of systems to build understanding from the pieces upward. In the emergy method of evaluation, sometimes called emergy synthesis , first the whole system is considered through diagramming, then the flows of energy, resources and information that drive the system are analyzed. By evaluating complex systems using emergy methods, the major inputs from the human economy and those coming “free” from the environment are integrated to analyze questions of public policy and environmental management.  Systems diagram  Systems diagrams are used to show the inputs that are evaluated and summed to obtain the emergy of a resulting flow or storage. The purpose of the system diagram is to conduct a critical inventory of processes, storages and flows that are important “drivers” of the system (all flows that inflow across the system boundary) and are therefore necessary to evaluate. A simple diagram of a city and its regional support area is shown in Figure 1 (many example diagrams can be found at the EmergySystems.org web site).  Preparation of evaluation table  A table (see example below) of the actual flows of resources, labor and energy is constructed from the diagram. Raw data on inflows that cross the boundary are converted into emergy units, and then summed to obtain total emergy supporting the system. Energy flows per unit time (usually per year) are presented in the table as separate line items. Tables are usually constructed in the same format, as given by the column headings and format below:  ::{| class="wikitable" |+Table 3. Example emergy evaluation table |- ! Note !! Item (name) !!

Column # 2 is the name of the item, which is also shown on the aggregated diagram.    Column # 3 is the raw data in joules, grams, dollars or other units.    Column # 4 shows the units for each raw data item.    Column # 5 is the unit emergy value, expressed in solar emergy joules per unit. Sometimes, inputs are expressed in grams, hours, or dollars, therefore an appropriate UEV is used (sej/hr; sej/g; sej/$).    Column # 6 is the solar emergy of a given flow, calculated as the raw input times the UEV (Column 3 times Column 5).    All tables are followed by the numbered footnotes that show citations for data and calculations.  Calculating unit values  After the table is prepared that evaluates all the inputs, a unit emergy value of the product or process is calculated. The output (row “O” in the example table above) is evaluated first in units of energy or mass. Then the input emergy is summed and the unit emergy value is calculated by dividing the emergy by the units of the output. The unit values that result for each evaluation are useful for other emergy evaluations. Thus, emergy evaluations generate new emergy unit values.  Performance indicators  The systems diagram in Figure 2 shows non-renewable environmental contributions (N) as an emergy storage of materials, renewable environmental inputs (R), and inputs from the economy as purchased (F) goods and services. Purchased inputs are needed for the process to take place and include human service and purchased non-renewable energy and material brought in from elsewhere (fuels, minerals, electricity, machinery, fertilizer, etc.). Several ratios, or indices are given in Figure 2 that are used to evaluate the global performance of a process as follows:   Emergy Yield Ratio (EYR) . Total emergy released (used up) per unit of emergy invested. The ratio is a measure of how much an investment enables a process to exploit local resources in order to further contribute to the economy.  Environmental Loading Ratio (ELR) . The ratio of nonrenewable and imported emergy use to renewable emergy use. It is an indicator of the pressure of a transformation process on the environment and can be considered a measure of ecosystem stress due to a production (transformation activity.  Emergy Sustainability Index (ESI) . The ratio of the Emergy Yield Ratio to the Environmental Loading Ratio. It measures the contribution of a resource or process to the economy per unit of environmental loading.  Aerial Empower Intensity . The ratio of total emergy use in the economy of a region or nation to the total area of the region or nation. Renewable and nonrenewable emergy density are also calculated separately by dividing the total renewable emergy by area and the total nonrenewable emergy by area, respectively.   Several other ratios are sometimes calculated depending on the type and scale of the systems being evaluated.   Percent Renewable Emergy (%Ren) . The ratio of renewable emergy to total emergy use. In the long run, only processes with high %Ren are sustainable.  Emprice . The emprice of a commodity is the emergy one receives for the money spent. Its units are sej/$.  Emergy Exchange Ratio (EER) . The ratio of emergy exchanged in a trade or purchase (what is received to what is given). The ratio is always expressed relative to one or the other trading partners and is a measure of the relative trade advantage of one partner over the other.  Emergy per capita . The ratio of total emergy use in the economy of a region or nation to the total population. Emergy per capita can be used as a measure of potential, average standard of living of the population.   Uses of methodology  The recognition of the relevance energy to the growth and dynamics of all complex systems has resulted in increased emphasis on methods of environmental evaluation that can account for and interpret the effects of matter and energy flows, at all scales in systems of humanity and nature. The following table lists some general areas in which the emergy methodology has been employed.  ::{| class="wikitable" Width="75%" |+Table 4.

This criticism may miss the fact that the goal of emergy evaluations is to provide an "ecocentric" value of systems, processes, and products as opposed to the anthropocentric values of economics. Thus it does not purport to replace economic values but to provide additional information, from a very different point of view, which public policy might benefit from.  While energy quality has been recognized, somewhat, in the energy literature where different forms of fossil energy are expressed in coal or oil equivalents, 25 and some researchers have even expressed electricity in oil equivalents 26 by using 1st law efficiencies, many researchers have been reluctant to accept quality corrections of other forms of energy and resources. The idea that a calorie of sunlight is not equivalent to a calorie of fossil fuel or electricity strikes many as absurd, based on the 1st Law definition of energy units as measures of heat (i.e. Joule's mechanical equivalent of heat ). 27 Others have rejected the concept as being impractical since from their perspective it is impossible to quantify the amount of sunlight that is required to produce a quantity of oil. This latter issue results from a concern about the uncertainty involved in such quantification. In combining systems of humanity and nature and evaluating environmental input to economies, mainstream economists criticize the emergy methodology for disregarding market driven values as determined by willingness to pay .
