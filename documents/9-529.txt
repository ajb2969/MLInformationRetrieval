   Logarithmically concave measure      Logarithmically concave measure   In mathematics , a Borel measure  μ on n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n is called logarithmically concave (or log-concave for short) if, for any compact subsets  A and B of R n and 0  \mu(\lambda A + (1-\lambda) B) \geq \mu(A)^\lambda \mu(B)^{1-\lambda},  where λ  A + (1 − λ ) B denotes the Minkowski sum of λ  A and (1 − λ ) B . 1  Examples  The Brunn–Minkowski inequality asserts that the Lebesgue measure is log-concave. The restriction of the Lebesgue measure to any convex set is also log-concave.  By a theorem of Borell, 2 a measure is log-concave if and only if it has a density with respect to the Lebesgue measure on some affine hyperplane, and this density is a logarithmically concave function . Thus, any Gaussian measure is log-concave.  The Prékopa–Leindler inequality shows that a convolution of log-concave measures is log-concave.
