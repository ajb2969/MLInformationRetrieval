   Gravitational binding energy      Gravitational binding energy   A gravitational binding energy is the energy that must be exported from a system for the system to enter a gravitationally bound state at a negative level of energy. Negative energy is called " potential energy ". 1 A gravitationally bound system has a lower ( i.e. , more negative) gravitational potential energy than the sum of its parts—this is what keeps the system aggregated in accordance with the minimum total potential energy principle . Therefore, a system's gravitational binding energy is the system's gravitational synergy .  For a spherical mass of uniform density , the gravitational binding energy U is given by the formula 2 3      U  =    3  G   M  2     5  R        U      3  G   superscript  M  2      5  R      U=\frac{3GM^{2}}{5R}     where G is the gravitational constant , M is the mass of the sphere, and R is its radius.  Assuming that the Earth is a uniform sphere (which is not correct, but is close enough to get an order-of-magnitude estimate) with M = 5.97 · 10 24 kg and r = 6.37 · 10 6 m, U is 2.24 · 10 32 J. This is roughly equal to one week of the Sun 's total energy output. It is 37.5 MJ/kg, 60% of the absolute value of the potential energy per kilogram at the surface.  The actual depth-dependence of density, inferred from seismic travel times (see Adams–Williamson equation ), is given in the Preliminary Reference Earth Model (PREM). 4 Using this, the real gravitational binding energy of Earth can be calculated numerically to U = 2.487 · 10 32 J  According to the virial theorem , the gravitational binding energy of a star is about two times its internal thermal energy . 5  Derivation for a uniform sphere  The gravitational binding energy of a sphere with Radius   R   R   R   is found by imagining that it is pulled apart by successively moving spherical shells to infinity, the outermost first, and finding the total energy needed for that.  If we assume a constant density   ρ   ρ   \rho   then the masses of a shell and the sphere inside it are:       m  shell   =   4  π   r  2    ρ   d  r        subscript  m  shell     4  π   superscript  r  2   ρ  d  r     m_{\mathrm{shell}}=4\pi r^{2}\rho\,dr   and     m  interior   =    4  3   π   r  3   ρ        subscript  m  interior       4  3   π   superscript  r  3   ρ     m_{\mathrm{interior}}=\frac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\rho     The required energy for a shell is the negative of the gravitational potential energy:      𝑑𝑈  =   -   G     m  shell    m  interior    r         𝑑𝑈      G       subscript  m  shell    subscript  m  interior    r       {\it dU}=-G\frac{m_{\mathrm{shell}}m_{\mathrm{interior}}}{r}     Integrating over all shells we get:      U  =   -   G    ∫  0  R       (   4  π   r  2   ρ   )    (    4  3   π   r  3   ρ   )    r   d  r      =   -   G   16  3    π  2    ρ  2     ∫  0  R     r  4   d  r      =   -   G   16  15    π  2    ρ  2    R  5           U      G    superscript   subscript   0   R           4  π   superscript  r  2   ρ       4  3   π   superscript  r  3   ρ    r   d  r               G    16  3    superscript  π  2    superscript  ρ  2     superscript   subscript   0   R      superscript  r  4   d  r               G    16  15    superscript  π  2    superscript  ρ  2    superscript  R  5        U=-G\int_{0}^{R}{\frac{(4\pi r^{2}\rho)(\tfrac{4}{3}\pi r^{3}\rho)}{r}}dr=-G{%

 \frac{3GM^{2}}{5R}     Non-uniform spheres  Planets and stars have radial density gradients from their lower density surfaces to their much larger density compressed cores. Degenerate matter objects (white dwarfs; neutron star pulsars) have radial density gradients plus relativistic corrections.  Neutron star relativistic equations of state provided by Jim Lattimer include a graph of radius vs. mass for various models. 6 The most likely radii for a given neutron star mass are bracketed by models AP4 (smallest radius) and MS2 (largest radius).
