   Optical properties of water and ice      Optical properties of water and ice   The refractive index of water at 20°C is 1.332986. The refractive index of normal ice is 1.31. (From List of refractive indices .) In general, an index of refraction is a complex number with both a real and imaginary part, where the latter indicates the strength of absorption loss at a particular wavelength. In the visible part of electromagnetic spectrum the imaginary part of the refractive index is very small. However, water and ice absorb in infrared and close the atmospheric window thereby contributing to the greenhouse effect  The absorption spectrum of pure water is used in numerous applications, including light scattering and absorption by ice crystals and cloud water droplets , theories of the rainbow , determination of the single scattering albedo , ocean color , and many others.  Quantitative description of the refraction index  Over the wavelengths from 0.2 μm to 1.2 μm, and over temperatures from −12°C to 500°C the real part of the index of refraction of water can be calculated by the following empirical expression: 1          n  2   -  1     n  2   +  2     (   1  /   ρ  ¯    )    =    a  0   +    a  1    ρ  ¯    +    a  2    T  ¯    +    a  3     λ  ¯   2    T  ¯    +    a  4     λ  ¯   2    +    a  5      λ  ¯   2   -    λ  ¯   𝑈𝑉  2     +    a  6      λ  ¯   2   -    λ  ¯   𝐼𝑅  2     +    a  7     ρ  ¯   2                superscript  n  2   1      superscript  n  2   2      1   normal-¯  ρ        subscript  a  0      subscript  a  1    normal-¯  ρ       subscript  a  2    normal-¯  T       subscript  a  3    superscript   normal-¯  λ   2    normal-¯  T       subscript  a  4    superscript   normal-¯  λ   2       subscript  a  5      superscript   normal-¯  λ   2    superscript   subscript   normal-¯  λ   𝑈𝑉   2        subscript  a  6      superscript   normal-¯  λ   2    superscript   subscript   normal-¯  λ   𝐼𝑅   2        subscript  a  7    superscript   normal-¯  ρ   2       \frac{n^{2}-1}{n^{2}+2}(1/\overline{\rho})=a_{0}+a_{1}\overline{\rho}+a_{2}%
