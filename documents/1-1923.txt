   Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale      Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale   The Palermo Technical Impact Hazard Scale is a logarithmic scale used by astronomers to rate the potential hazard of impact of a near-earth object (NEO). It combines two types of data — probability of impact, and estimated kinetic yield—into a single "hazard" value. A rating of 0 means the hazard is equivalent to the background hazard (defined as the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact). 1 A rating of +2 would indicate the hazard is 100 times greater than a random background event. Scale values less than −2 reflect events for which there are no likely consequences, while Palermo Scale values between −2 and 0 indicate situations that merit careful monitoring. A similar but less complex scale is the Torino Scale , which is used for simpler descriptions in the non-scientific media.  Scale  The scale compares the likelihood of the detected potential impact with the average risk posed by objects of the same size or larger over the years until the date of the potential impact. This average risk from random impacts is known as the background risk. The Palermo Scale value, P , is defined by the equation:      P  ≡    log  10     p  i     f  B   T         P    subscript   10      subscript  p  i      subscript  f  B   T       P\equiv\log_{10}\frac{p_{i}}{f_{B}T}     where  :* p i is the impact probability  :* T is the time interval over which p i is considered  :* f B is the background impact frequency  The background impact frequency is defined for this purpose as:       f  B   =    3  100    E   -   4  /  5     y    r   -  1           subscript  f  B       3  100    superscript  E      4  5     y   superscript  r    1       f_{B}=\frac{3}{100}E^{-4/5}yr^{-1}\;     where the energy threshold E is measured in megatons , yr is the unit of T divided by one year.  Positive rating  The near-Earth object  was the first near-Earth object detected by NASA 's latest NEO program to be given a positive rating on the scale of 0.06, 2 indicating a higher-than-background threat. The value was subsequently lowered after more measurements were taken and 2002 NT7 is no longer considered to pose any risk, and was removed from the Sentry Risk Table on 1 August 2002. 3  For a brief period in late December 2004, asteroid  (then known only by its provisional designation ) held the record for Palermo scale values, with a value of 1.10 4 for a possible collision in the year 2029. The 1.10 value indicated that a collision with this object was considered to be almost 12.6 times more likely than a random background event: 1 in 37 5 instead of 1 in 472. With further observations, the possibility of a 2029 impact was eliminated. As of 2013 a maximum Palermo rating of −3.32 applies, due to a possible event in 2068. 6  In September 2002, the highest Palermo rating was that of asteroid (29075) 1950 DA , with a value of 0.17 for a possible collision in the year 2880. 7 In August 2014, the Palermo rating for (29075) 1950 DA was reduced to −1.81. 8  References  The primary reference for the Palermo Technical Scale is "Quantifying the risk posed by potential Earth impacts" by Chesley et al., Icarus 159, 423-432 (2002).
