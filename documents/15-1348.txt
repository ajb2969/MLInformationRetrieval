   Trimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase      Trimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase   Trimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase (, mttB (gene) , trimethylamine methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name trimethylamine:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   trimethylamine + [Co(I) trimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [methyl-Co(III) trimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein] + dimethylamine    This enzyme is involved in methanogenesis from trimethylamine.
