Trimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase

Trimethylamine-corrinoid protein Co-methyltransferase (, mttB (gene), trimethylamine methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name trimethylamine:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

trimethylamine + [Co(I) trimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein] 
 
 
 
  [methyl-Co(III) trimethylamine-specific corrinoid protein] + dimethylamine


This enzyme is involved in methanogenesis from trimethylamine.
