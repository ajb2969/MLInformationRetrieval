Affine term structure model

An affine term structure model is a financial model that relates zero-coupon bond prices (i.e. the discount curve) to a spot rate model. It is particularly useful for inverting the yield curve â€“ the process of determining spot rate model inputs from observable bond market data.
Background
Start with a stochastic short rate model 
 
 
 
  with dynamics



and a risk-free zero-coupon bond maturing at time 
 
 
 
 
  with price 
 
 
 
  at time 
 
 
 
 . If



and 
 
 
 
  has the form



where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are deterministic functions, then the short rate model is said to have an affine term structure.
Existence
Using Ito's formula we can determine the constraints on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which will result in an affine term structure. Assuming the bond has an affine term structure and 
 
 
 
 
  satisfies the term structure equation, we get



The boundary value



implies



Next, assume that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are affine in 
 
 
 
 :



The differential equation then becomes



Because this formula must hold for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , the coefficient of 
 
 
 
  must equal zero.



Then the other term must vanish as well.



Then, assuming 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are affine in 
 
 
 
 , the model has an affine term structure where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  satisfy the system of equations:
