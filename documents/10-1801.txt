   Glycine formimidoyltransferase      Glycine formimidoyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycine formimidoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-formimidoyltetrahydrofolate + glycine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   tetrahydrofolate + N-formimidoylglycine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5-formimidoyltetrahydrofolate and glycine , whereas its two products are tetrahydrofolate and N-formimidoylglycine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases that transfer one-carbon groups, specifically the hydroxymethyl-, formyl- and related transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-formimidoyltetrahydrofolate:glycine N-formimidoyltransferase . Other names in common use include formiminoglycine formiminotransferase , FIG formiminotransferase , and glycine formiminotransferase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism and one carbon pool by folate .  References       "  Category:EC 2.1.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
