YDbDr

 YDbDr, sometimes written YDBDR, is the colour space used in the SÃ‰CAM analog terrestrial colour television broadcasting standard, which is used in France and some countries of the former Eastern Bloc. It is very close to YUV (PAL) and its related colour spaces such as YIQ (NTSC), YPbPr and YCbCr.
YDbDr is composed of three components - 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is the luminance, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are the chrominance components, representing the red and blue colour differences.
Formulas
The three component signals are created from an original RGB (red, green and blue) source. The weighted values of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are added together to produce a single 
 
 
 
  signal, representing the overall brightness, or luminance, of that spot. The 
 
 
 
 
  signal is then created by subtracting the 
 
 
 
  from the blue signal of the original RGB, and then scaling; and 
 
 
 
  by subtracting the 
 
 
 
  from the red, and then scaling by a different factor.
These formulae approximate the conversion between the RGB colour space and YDbDr.

You may note that the 
 
 
 
  component of YDbDr is the same as the 
 
 
 
  component of YUV. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are related to the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  components of the YUV colour space as follows:


 
 
  There is also a variety of the PAL broadcasting standard, PAL-N, that uses the YDbDr colour space.
