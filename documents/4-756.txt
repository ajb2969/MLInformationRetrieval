   YDbDr      YDbDr    YDbDr , sometimes written YD B D R , is the colour space used in the SÃ‰CAM analog terrestrial colour television broadcasting standard, which is used in France and some countries of the former Eastern Bloc . It is very close to YUV ( PAL ) and its related colour spaces such as YIQ ( NTSC ), YPbPr and YCbCr .  YDbDr is composed of three components -   Y   Y   Y   ,    D  B     subscript  D  B    D_{B}   and    D  R     subscript  D  R    D_{R}   .   Y   Y   Y   is the luminance ,    D  B     subscript  D  B    D_{B}   and    D  R     subscript  D  R    D_{R}   are the chrominance components, representing the red and blue colour differences.  Formulas  The three component signals are created from an original RGB (red, green and blue) source. The weighted values of   R   R   R   ,   G   G   G   and   B   B   B   are added together to produce a single   Y   Y   Y   signal, representing the overall brightness, or luminance, of that spot. The    D  B     subscript  D  B    D_{B}   signal is then created by subtracting the   Y   Y   Y   from the blue signal of the original RGB, and then scaling; and    D  R     subscript  D  R    D_{R}   by subtracting the   Y   Y   Y   from the red, and then scaling by a different factor.  These formulae approximate the conversion between the RGB colour space and YDbDr.      R  ,  G  ,  B  ,  Y     R  G  B  Y    \displaystyle R,G,B,Y   From RGB to YDbDr:     Y   Y   \displaystyle Y   From YDbDr to RGB:     R   R   \displaystyle R     You may note that the   Y   Y   Y   component of YDbDr is the same as the   Y   Y   Y   component of YUV.    D  B     subscript  D  B    D_{B}   and    D  R     subscript  D  R    D_{R}   are related to the   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   components of the YUV colour space as follows:      D  B     subscript  D  B    \displaystyle D_{B}   There is also a variety of the PAL broadcasting standard, PAL-N , that uses the YDbDr colour space.
