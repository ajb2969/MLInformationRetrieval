Additively indecomposable ordinal

In set theory, a branch of mathematics, an additively indecomposable ordinal α is any ordinal number that is not 0 such that for any 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
  The class of additively indecomposable ordinals (aka gamma numbers) is denoted 
 
 

From the continuity of addition in its right argument, we get that if 
 
 
 
  and α is additively indecomposable, then 
 
 

Obviously 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
  No finite ordinal other than 
 
 
 
  is in 
 
 
 
  Also, 
 
 
 
 , since the sum of two finite ordinals is still finite. More generally, every infinite cardinal is in 
 
 

 
  is closed and unbounded, so the enumerating function of 
 
 
 
  is normal. In fact, 
 
 

The derivative 
 
 
 
  (which enumerates fixed points of fH) is written 
 
 
 
  Ordinals of this form (that is, fixed points of 
 
 
 
 ) are called epsilon numbers. The number 
 
 
 
  is therefore the first fixed point of the sequence


Multiplicatively indecomposable
A similar notion can be defined for multiplication. The multiplicatively indecomposable ordinals (aka delta numbers) are those of the form 
 
 
 
  for any ordinal α. Every epsilon number is multiplicatively indecomposable; and every multiplicatively indecomposable ordinal is additively indecomposable. The delta numbers are the same as the prime ordinals that are limits.
