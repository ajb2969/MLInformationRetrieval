   Additively indecomposable ordinal      Additively indecomposable ordinal   In set theory , a branch of mathematics , an additively indecomposable ordinal α is any ordinal number that is not 0 such that for any     β  ,  γ   <  α       β  γ   α    \beta,\gamma<\alpha   , we have      β  +  γ   <  α   .        β  γ   α    \beta+\gamma<\alpha.   The class of additively indecomposable ordinals (aka gamma numbers ) is denoted    ℍ  .    ℍ   \mathbb{H}.     From the continuity of addition in its right argument, we get that if    β  <  α      β  α    \beta<\alpha   and α is additively indecomposable, then      β  +  α   =  α   .        β  α   α    \beta+\alpha=\alpha.     Obviously    1  ∈  ℍ      1  ℍ    1\in\mathbb{H}   , since     0  +  0   <  1.        0  0   1.    0+0<1.   No finite ordinal other than   1   1   1   is in    ℍ  .    ℍ   \mathbb{H}.   Also,    ω  ∈  ℍ      ω  ℍ    \omega\in\mathbb{H}   , since the sum of two finite ordinals is still finite. More generally, every infinite  cardinal is in    ℍ  .    ℍ   \mathbb{H}.      ℍ   ℍ   \mathbb{H}   is closed and unbounded, so the enumerating function of   ℍ   ℍ   \mathbb{H}   is normal. In fact,       f  ℍ    (  α  )    =   ω  α    .         subscript  f  ℍ   α    superscript  ω  α     f_{\mathbb{H}}(\alpha)=\omega^{\alpha}.     The derivative     f  ℍ  ′    (  α  )        superscript   subscript  f  ℍ   normal-′   α    f_{\mathbb{H}}^{\prime}(\alpha)   (which enumerates fixed points of f H ) is written     ϵ  α   .     subscript  ϵ  α    \epsilon_{\alpha}.   Ordinals of this form (that is, fixed points of    f  ℍ     subscript  f  ℍ    f_{\mathbb{H}}   ) are called epsilon numbers . The number     ϵ  0   =   ω   ω   ω   ⋅   ⋅  ⋅            subscript  ϵ  0    superscript  ω   superscript  ω   superscript  ω   superscript  normal-⋅   superscript  normal-⋅  normal-⋅         \epsilon_{0}=\omega^{\omega^{\omega^{\cdot^{\cdot^{\cdot}}}}}   is therefore the first fixed point of the sequence     ω  ,    ω  ω    ,    ω   ω  ω     ,  …     ω   superscript  ω  ω    superscript  ω   superscript  ω  ω    normal-…    \omega,\omega^{\omega}\!,\omega^{\omega^{\omega}}\!\!,\ldots     Multiplicatively indecomposable  A similar notion can be defined for multiplication. The multiplicatively indecomposable ordinals (aka delta numbers ) are those of the form     ω   ω  α       superscript  ω   superscript  ω  α     \omega^{\omega^{\alpha}}\,   for any ordinal α. Every epsilon number is multiplicatively indecomposable; and every multiplicatively indecomposable ordinal is additively indecomposable. The delta numbers are the same as the prime ordinals that are limits.  See also   Ordinal arithmetic   References     "  Category:Ordinal numbers
