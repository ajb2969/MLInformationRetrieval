   Cysteine desulfurase      Cysteine desulfurase   In enzymology , a cysteine desulfurase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-cysteine + [enzyme]-cysteine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   L-alanine + [enzyme]-S-sulfanylcysteine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-cysteine and [[[enzyme]-cysteine]], whereas its two products are L-alanine and [[[enzyme]-S-sulfanylcysteine]].  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfurtransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cysteine:[enzyme cysteine] sulfurtransferase . Other names in common use include IscS , NIFS , NifS , SufS , and cysteine desulfurylase . This enzyme participates in thiamine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
