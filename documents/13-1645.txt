Coefficient of fractional parentage

In physics, coefficients of fractional parentage (cfp's) can be used to obtain anti-symmetric many-body states for like particles. In a jj-coupling scheme they are defined by the following relation.



The state 
 
 
 
  is normalized and totally anti-symmetric with respect to permutations of all its N particles, while the state 
 
 
 
  is normalized and totally anti-symmetric with respect to all its N − 1 particles.
