   Phosphoenolpyruvate—protein phosphotransferase      Phosphoenolpyruvate—protein phosphotransferase   In enzymology , a phosphoenolpyruvate-protein phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phosphoenolpyruvate + protein histidine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   pyruvate + protein Npi-phospho-L-histidine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphoenolpyruvate and protein histidine , whereas its two products are pyruvate and protein Npi-phospho-L-histidine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a nitrogenous group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phosphoenolpyruvate:protein-L-histidine Npi-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include phosphoenolpyruvate sugar phosphotransferase enzyme I , phosphopyruvate-protein factor phosphotransferase , phosphopyruvate-protein phosphotransferase , sugar-PEP phosphotransferase enzyme I , and phosphoenolpyruvate:protein-L-histidine N-pros-phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in phosphotransferase system (pts) .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 13 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
