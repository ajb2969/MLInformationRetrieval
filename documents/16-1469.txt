   Klingen Eisenstein series      Klingen Eisenstein series   In mathematics, a Klingen Eisenstein series is a Siegel modular form of weight k and degree g depending on another Siegel cusp form f of weight k and degree r  g + r + 1 an even integer. The Klingen Eisenstein series is        ∑     (       a  b        c  d       )    \isin    P  r    ∖   Γ  g      f   (     a  τ   +  b     c  τ   +  d    )    det    (    c  τ   +  d   )    -  k       .      subscript        binomial    a  b     c  d    \isin   subscript  P  r     subscript  normal-Γ  g       f        a  τ   b       c  τ   d       superscript      c  τ   d     k        \sum_{{\left({{ab}\atop{cd}}\right)}\isin P_{r}\setminus\Gamma_{g}}f\left(%
 \frac{a\tau+b}{c\tau+d}\right)\det(c\tau+d)^{-k}.     It is a Siegel modular form of weight k and degree g . Here P r is the integral points of a certain parabolic subgroup of the symplectic group , and Γ r is the group of integral points of the degree g symplectic group. The variable τ is in the Siegel upper half plane of degree g . The function f is originally defined only for elements of the Siegel upper half plane of degree r , but extended to the Siegel upper half plane of degree g by projecting this to the smaller Siegel upper half plane.  The cusp form f is the image of the Klingen Eisenstein series under the operator Φ g − r , where Φ is the Siegel operator .  References     "  Category:Automorphic forms
