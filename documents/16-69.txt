(-)-germacrene D synthase




(-)-germacrene D synthase

(-)-germacrene D synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((-)-germacrene-D-forming).1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (-)-germacrene D + diphosphate


In Solidago canadensis the biosynthesis results in the pro-R hydrogen at C-1 of the farnesy diphosphate.
