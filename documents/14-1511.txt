Deviation risk measure

In financial mathematics, a deviation risk measure is a function to quantify financial risk (and not necessarily downside risk) in a different method than a general risk measure. Deviation risk measures generalize the concept of standard deviation.
Mathematical definition
A function 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the L2 space of random portfolio returns, is a deviation risk measure if

Shift-invariant
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 

Normalization
 
 

Positively homogeneous
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

Sublinearity
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 

Positivity
 
 
 
  for all nonconstant X, and 
 
 
 
  for any constant X.12

Relation to risk measure
There is a one-to-one relationship between a deviation risk measure D and an expectation-bounded risk measure R where for any 
 
 







 
 .

R is expectation bounded if 
 
 
 
  for any nonconstant X and 
 
 
 
  for any constant X.
If 
 
 
 
  for every X (where 
 
 
 
  is the essential infimum), then there is a relationship between D and a coherent risk measure.3
Examples
The standard deviation is clearly a deviation risk measure.
