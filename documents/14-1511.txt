   Deviation risk measure      Deviation risk measure   In financial mathematics , a deviation risk measure is a function to quantify financial risk (and not necessarily downside risk ) in a different method than a general risk measure . Deviation risk measures generalize the concept of standard deviation .  Mathematical definition  A function    D  :    ℒ  2   →   [  0  ,   +  ∞   ]       normal-:  D   normal-→   superscript  ℒ  2    0          D:\mathcal{L}^{2}\to[0,+\infty]   , where    ℒ  2     superscript  ℒ  2    \mathcal{L}^{2}   is the L2 space of random  portfolio returns , is a deviation risk measure if   Shift-invariant     D   (   X  +  r   )    =   D   (  X  )          D    X  r      D  X     D(X+r)=D(X)   for any    r  ∈  ℝ      r  ℝ    r\in\mathbb{R}     Normalization     D   (  0  )    =  0        D  0   0    D(0)=0     Positively homogeneous     D   (   λ  X   )    =   λ  D   (  X  )          D    λ  X      λ  D  X     D(\lambda X)=\lambda D(X)   for any    X  ∈   ℒ  2       X   superscript  ℒ  2     X\in\mathcal{L}^{2}   and    λ  >  0      λ  0    \lambda>0     Sublinearity     D   (   X  +  Y   )    ≤    D   (  X  )    +   D   (  Y  )           D    X  Y        D  X     D  Y      D(X+Y)\leq D(X)+D(Y)   for any     X  ,  Y   ∈   ℒ  2        X  Y    superscript  ℒ  2     X,Y\in\mathcal{L}^{2}     Positivity     D   (  X  )    >  0        D  X   0    D(X)>0   for all nonconstant X , and     D   (  X  )    =  0        D  X   0    D(X)=0   for any constant X . 1 2   Relation to risk measure  There is a one-to-one relationship between a deviation risk measure D and an expectation-bounded risk measure  R where for any    X  ∈   ℒ  2       X   superscript  ℒ  2     X\in\mathcal{L}^{2}           D   (  X  )    =   R   (   X  -   𝔼   [  X  ]     )          D  X     R    X    𝔼   delimited-[]  X        D(X)=R(X-\mathbb{E}[X])          R   (  X  )    =    D   (  X  )    -   𝔼   [  X  ]           R  X       D  X     𝔼   delimited-[]  X       R(X)=D(X)-\mathbb{E}[X]   .   R is expectation bounded if     R   (  X  )    >   𝔼   [   -  X   ]          R  X     𝔼   delimited-[]    X       R(X)>\mathbb{E}[-X]   for any nonconstant X and     R   (  X  )    =   𝔼   [   -  X   ]          R  X     𝔼   delimited-[]    X       R(X)=\mathbb{E}[-X]   for any constant X .  If     D   (  X  )    <    𝔼   [  X  ]    -    ess  inf   X          D  X       𝔼   delimited-[]  X       ess  infimum   X      D(X)<\mathbb{E}[X]-\operatorname{ess\inf}X   for every X (where    ess  inf      ess  infimum    \operatorname{ess\inf}   is the essential infimum ), then there is a relationship between D and a coherent risk measure . 3  Examples  The standard deviation is clearly a deviation risk measure.
