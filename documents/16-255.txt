   Multiplicative sequence      Multiplicative sequence   In mathematics , a multiplicative sequence or m -sequence is a sequence of polynomials associated with a formal group structure. They have application in the cobordism ring in algebraic topology .  Definition  Let K n be polynomials over a ring  A in indeterminates p 1 ,... weighted so that p i has weight i (with p 0 = 1) and all the terms in K n have weight n (so that K n is a polynomial in p 1 , ..., p n ). The sequence K n is multiplicative if an identity        ∑  i     p  i    z  i     =    ∑  i      p  i  ′    z  i    ⋅    ∑  i     p  i  ′′    z  i             subscript   i      subscript  p  i    superscript  z  i       subscript   i    normal-⋅     subscript   superscript  p  normal-′   i    superscript  z  i      subscript   i      subscript   superscript  p  ′′   i    superscript  z  i         \sum_{i}p_{i}z^{i}=\sum_{i}p^{\prime}_{i}z^{i}\cdot\sum_{i}p^{\prime\prime}_{i%
 }z^{i}     implies        ∑  i     K  i    (   p  1   ,  …  ,   p  i   )    z  i     =    ∑  j      K  j    (   p  1  ′   ,  …  ,   p  j  ′   )    z  j    ⋅    ∑  k     K  k    (   p  1  ′′   ,  …  ,   p  k  ′′   )    z  k             subscript   i      subscript  K  i     subscript  p  1   normal-…   subscript  p  i     superscript  z  i       subscript   j    normal-⋅     subscript  K  j     subscript   superscript  p  normal-′   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  p  normal-′   j     superscript  z  j      subscript   k      subscript  K  k     subscript   superscript  p  ′′   1   normal-…   subscript   superscript  p  ′′   k     superscript  z  k         \sum_{i}K_{i}(p_{1},\ldots,p_{i})z^{i}=\sum_{j}K_{j}(p^{\prime}_{1},\ldots,p^{%

 \prime}_{k})z^{k}     The power series      ∑    K  n    (  1  ,  0  ,  …  ,  0  )    z  n           subscript  K  n    1  0  normal-…  0    superscript  z  n      \sum K_{n}(1,0,\ldots,0)z^{n}     is the characteristic power series of the K n . A multiplicative sequence is determined by its characteristic power series Q ( z ), and every power series with constant term 1 gives rise to a multiplicative sequence.  To recover a multiplicative sequence from a characteristic power series Q ( z ) we consider the coefficient of z j in the product       ∏   i  =  1   m    Q   (    β  i   z   )        superscript   subscript  product    i  1    m     Q     subscript  β  i   z      \prod_{i=1}^{m}Q(\beta_{i}z)     for any m > j . This is symmetric in the β i and homogeneous of weight j : so can be expressed as a polynomial K j ( p 1 , ..., p j ) in the elementary symmetric functions  p of the β . Then K j defines a multiplicative sequence.  Examples  As an example, the sequence K n = p n is multiplicative and has characteristic power series 1 + z .  Consider the power series       Q   (  z  )    =    z    tanh   z     =   1  -    ∑   k  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )   k     2   2  k      (   2  k   )   !     B  k    z  k              Q  z       z       z            1    superscript   subscript     k  1         superscript    1   k      superscript  2    2  k        2  k      subscript  B  k    superscript  z  k         Q(z)=\frac{\sqrt{z}}{\tanh\sqrt{z}}=1-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\frac{2^{2k}}%
 {(2k)!}B_{k}z^{k}     where B k is the k -th Bernoulli number . The multiplicative sequence with Q as characteristic power series is denoted L j ( p 1 , ..., p j ).  The multiplicative sequence with characteristic power series       Q   (  z  )    =    2   z     sinh   2   z            Q  z       2    z        2    z        Q(z)=\frac{2\sqrt{z}}{\sinh 2\sqrt{z}}     is denoted A j ( p 1 ,..., p j ).  The multiplicative sequence with characteristic power series       Q   (  z  )    =   z   1  -   exp   (   -  z   )      =    1  +   x  2    -    ∑   k  =  1   ∞      (   -  1   )   k     B  k     (   2  k   )   !     z   2  k               Q  z     z    1      z               1    x  2      superscript   subscript     k  1         superscript    1   k      subscript  B  k       2  k      superscript  z    2  k          Q(z)=\frac{z}{1-\exp(-z)}=1+\frac{x}{2}-\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}(-1)^{k}\frac{B_{k}%
 }{(2k)!}z^{2k}     is denoted T j ( p 1 ,..., p j ): these are the Todd polynomials .  Genus  The genus of a multiplicative sequence is a ring homomorphism , from the cobordism ring of smooth oriented compact manifolds to another ring , usually the ring of rational numbers .  For example, the Todd genus is associated to the Todd polynomials with characteristic power series    z   1  -   exp   (   -  z   )         z    1      z       \frac{z}{1-\exp(-z)}   .
