   Tropine acyltransferase      Tropine acyltransferase   Tropine acyltransferase (, tropine:acyl-CoA transferase , acetyl-CoA:tropan-3-ol acyltransferase , tropine acetyltransferase , tropine tigloyltransferase , TAT ) is an enzyme with system name acyl-CoA:tropine O-acyltransferase . 1 2 3 4 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + tropine    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + O-acyltropine   This enzyme exhibits absolute specificity for the endo/3alpha configuration found in tropine as pseudotropine .
