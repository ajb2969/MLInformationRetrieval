6-Deoxy-5-ketofructose 1-phosphate synthase

6-deoxy-5-ketofructose 1-phosphate synthase (, DKFP synthase, MJ1585 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 2-oxopropanal:D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate glycerone-phosphotransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) methylglyoxal + D-fructose 1,6-bisphosphate 
 
 
 
  D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate + 1-deoxy-D-threo-hexo-2,5-diulose 6-phosphate
 
(2) methylglyoxal + D-fructose 1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  D-glyceraldehyde + 1-deoxy-D-threo-hexo-2,5-diulose 6-phosphate
 

This enzyme plays a key role in an alternative pathway of the biosynthesis of 3-dehydroquinate.
