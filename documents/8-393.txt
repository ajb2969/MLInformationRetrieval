   W-shingling      W-shingling   In natural language processing a w-shingling is a set of unique "shingles" ( n-grams , contiguous subsequences of tokens in a document ) that can be used to gauge the similarity of two documents . The w denotes the number of tokens in each shingle in the set.  The document, "a rose is a rose is a rose" can be tokenized as follows:   (a,rose,is,a,rose,is,a,rose)   The set of all contiguous sequences of 4 tokens (4-grams) is   { (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose), (is,a,rose,is), (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose) } = { (a,rose,is,a), (rose,is,a,rose), (is,a,rose,is) }   Resemblance  For a given shingle size, the degree to which two documents A and B resemble each other can be expressed as the ratio of the magnitudes of their shinglings' intersection and union , or       r   (  A  ,  B  )    =    |    S   (  A  )    ∩   S   (  B  )     |    |    S   (  A  )    ∪   S   (  B  )     |          r   A  B            S  A     S  B           S  A     S  B        r(A,B)={{|S(A)\cap S(B)|}\over{|S(A)\cup S(B)|}}     where |A| is the size of set A. The resemblance is a number in the range [0,1], where 1 indicates that two documents are identical. This definition is identical with the Jaccard coefficient describing similarity and diversity of sample sets.
