   Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series      Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series   In mathematics , and in particular in the field of algebra , a Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series (also known under the name Hilbert series ), named after David Hilbert and Henri Poincar√© , is an adaptation of the notion of dimension to the context of graded algebraic structures (where the dimension of the entire structure is often infinite). It is a formal power series in one indeterminate, say t , where the coefficient of t n gives the dimension (or rank) of the sub-structure of elements homogeneous of degree n . It is closely related to the Hilbert polynomial in cases when the latter exists; however, the Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series describes the rank in every degree, while the Hilbert polynomial describes it only in all but finitely many degrees, and therefore provides less information. In particular the Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series cannot be deduced from the Hilbert polynomial even if the latter exists. In good cases, the Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series can be expressed as a rational function of its argument t .  Definition  Let K be a field, and let    V  =    ‚äï   i  ‚àà  ùêç     V  i        V    subscript  direct-sum    i  ùêç     subscript  V  i      V=\textstyle\bigoplus_{i\in\mathbf{N}}V_{i}   be a N - graded vector space over K , where each subspace V i of vectors of degree n is finite-dimensional. Then the Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series of V is the formal power series        ‚àë   i  ‚àà  ùêç      dim  K     (   V  i   )    t  i      .      subscript     i  ùêç      subscript  dimension  K      subscript  V  i    superscript  t  i       \sum_{i\in\mathbf{N}}\dim_{K}(V_{i})t^{i}.   A similar definition can be given for an N -graded R -module over any commutative ring  R in which each submodule of elements homogeneous of a fixed degree n is free of finite rank; it suffices to replace the dimension by the rank. Often the graded vector space or module of which the Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series is considered has additional structure, for instance that of a ring, but the Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series is independent of the multiplicative or other structure.  Example: Since there are    (       n  +  k       n      )     binomial    n  k   n    {\left({{n+k}\atop{n}}\right)}   monomials of degree k in variables     X  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   X  n       subscript  X  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  X  n     X_{0},\dots,X_{n}   (by induction, say), it follows immediately that the Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series of K [ X 0 , X 1 ,‚Ä¶, X n ] is     (   1  -  t   )     -  n   -  1      superscript    1  t       n   1     (1-t)^{-n-1}     Hilbert‚ÄìSerre theorem  Suppose M is a finitely generated graded module over      A   [   x  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x  n   ]    ,   deg   x  i     =   d  i          A    subscript  x  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x  n      deg   subscript  x  i      subscript  d  i     A[x_{0},\dots,x_{n}],\operatorname{deg}x_{i}=d_{i}   with an Artinian ring (e.g., a field) A . Then the Poincar√© series of M is a polynomial with integral coefficients divided by    ‚àè   (   1  -   t   d  i     )      product    1   superscript  t   subscript  d  i       \prod(1-t^{d_{i}})   . The standard proof today is an induction on n . Hilbert's original proof made a use of Hilbert's syzygy theorem (a projective resolution of M ), which gives more homological information.  Here is a proof by induction on n . If    n  =  0      n  0    n=0   , then, since M has finite length,     M  k   =  0       subscript  M  k   0    M_{k}=0   if k is large enough. Next, suppose the theorem is true for    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   and consider the exact sequence of graded modules (exact degree-wise), with the notation     N    (  l  )   k    =   N   k  +  l          N   subscript  l  k     subscript  N    k  l      N(l)_{k}=N_{k+l}   ,      0  ‚Üí   K   (   -   d  n    )    ‚Üí   M   (   -   d  n    )    ‚Üí   x  n    M   ‚Üí  C  ‚Üí  0       normal-‚Üí  0    K     subscript  d  n       normal-‚Üí      M     subscript  d  n      subscript  x  n   normal-‚Üí   M     normal-‚Üí    C    normal-‚Üí    0     0\to K(-d_{n})\to M(-d_{n})\overset{x_{n}}{\to}M\to C\to 0   . Since the length is additive, Poincar√© series are also additive. Hence, we have:       P   (  M  ,  t  )    =     -   P   (   K   (   -   d  n    )    ,  t  )     +   P   (   M   (   -   d  n    )    ,  t  )     -   P   (  C  ,  t  )           P   M  t            P     K     subscript  d  n     t       P     M     subscript  d  n     t       P   C  t       P(M,t)=-P(K(-d_{n}),t)+P(M(-d_{n}),t)-P(C,t)   . We can write     P   (   M   (   -   d  n    )    ,  t  )    =    t   d  n    P   (  M  ,  t  )          P     M     subscript  d  n     t       superscript  t   subscript  d  n    P   M  t      P(M(-d_{n}),t)=t^{d_{n}}P(M,t)   . Since K is killed by    x  n     subscript  x  n    x_{n}   , we can regard it as a graded module over    A   [   x  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x   n  -  1    ]       A    subscript  x  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x    n  1       A[x_{0},\dots,x_{n-1}]   ; the same is true for C . The theorem thus now follows from the inductive hypothesis.  Chain complex  An example of graded vector space is associated to a chain complex , or cochain complex C of vector spaces; the latter takes the form      0  ‚Üí   C  0    ‚ü∂   d  0     C  1    ‚ü∂   d  1     C  2    ‚ü∂   d  2    ‚ãØ   ‚ü∂   d   n  -  1      C  n   ‚ü∂  0.       normal-‚Üí  0   superscript  C  0      superscript  normal-‚ü∂   subscript  d  0       superscript  C  1      superscript  normal-‚ü∂   subscript  d  1       superscript  C  2      superscript  normal-‚ü∂   subscript  d  2      normal-‚ãØ     superscript  normal-‚ü∂   subscript  d    n  1        superscript  C  n     normal-‚ü∂    0.     0\to C^{0}\stackrel{d_{0}}{\longrightarrow}C^{1}\stackrel{d_{1}}{%

 {\longrightarrow}C^{n}\longrightarrow 0.     The Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© series (here often called the Poincar√© polynomial) of the graded vector space     ‚äï  i    C  i       subscript  direct-sum  i    superscript  C  i     \bigoplus_{i}C^{i}   for this complex is         P  C    (  t  )    =    ‚àë   j  =  0   n    dim    (   C  j   )    t  j       .         subscript  P  C   t     superscript   subscript     j  0    n    dimension     superscript  C  j    superscript  t  j        P_{C}(t)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\dim(C^{j})t^{j}.     The Hilbert‚ÄìPoincar√© polynomial of the cohomology , with cohomology spaces H j = H j ( C ), is         P  H    (  t  )    =    ‚àë   j  =  0   n    dim    (   H  j   )    t  j       .         subscript  P  H   t     superscript   subscript     j  0    n    dimension     superscript  H  j    superscript  t  j        P_{H}(t)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}\dim(H^{j})t^{j}.     A famous relation between the two is that there is a polynomial    Q   (  t  )       Q  t    Q(t)   with non-negative coefficients, such that        P  C    (  t  )    -    P  H    (  t  )     =    (   1  +  t   )   Q   (  t  )     .           subscript  P  C   t      subscript  P  H   t        1  t   Q  t     P_{C}(t)-P_{H}(t)=(1+t)Q(t).
