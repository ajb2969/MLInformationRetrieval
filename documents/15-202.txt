   Gabriel–Popescu theorem      Gabriel–Popescu theorem   In mathematics , the Gabriel–Popescu theorem is an embedding theorem for certain abelian categories , introduced by . It characterizes certain abelian categories (the Grothendieck categories ) as quotients of module categories.  There are several generalizations and variations of the Gabriel–Popescu theorem, given by  (for an AB5 category with a set of generators ), ,  (for triangulated categories ).  Theorem  Let A be a Grothendieck category (an AB5 category with a generator), U a generator of A and R be the ring of endomorphisms of U ; also, let S be the functor from A to Mod- R (the category of right R -modules) defined by S ( X ) = Hom( U , X ). Then the Gabriel–Popescu theorem states that S is full and faithful and has an exact  left adjoint .  This implies that A is equivalent to the Serre quotient category of Mod- R by a certain localizing subcategory  C . (A localizing subcategory of Mod- R is a full subcategory C of Mod- R , closed under arbitrary direct sums , such that for any short exact sequence of modules    0  →   M  1   →   M  2   →   M  3   →  0       normal-→  0   subscript  M  1     normal-→     subscript  M  2     normal-→     subscript  M  3     normal-→    0     0\rightarrow M_{1}\rightarrow M_{2}\rightarrow M_{3}\rightarrow 0   , we have M 2 in C if and only if M 1 and M 3 are in C . The Serre quotient of Mod- R by any localizing subcategory is a Grothendieck category.) We may take C to be the kernel of the left adjoint of the functor S .
