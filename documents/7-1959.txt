   Hopf conjecture      Hopf conjecture   In mathematics, Hopf conjecture may refer to one of several conjectural statements from differential geometry and topology attributed to either Eberhard Hopf or Heinz Hopf .  Positively curved Riemannian manifolds   A compact, even-dimensional Riemannian manifold with positive sectional curvature has positive Euler characteristic    For surfaces , this follows from the Gauss–Bonnet theorem . For four-dimensional manifolds, this follows from the finiteness of the fundamental group and the Poincaré duality . The conjecture has been proved for manifolds of dimension 4 k +2 or 4 k +4 admitting an isometric torus action of a k -dimensional torus and for manifolds M admitting an isometric action of a compact Lie group  G with principal isotropy subgroup H and cohomogeneity k such that       k  -   (    rank  G   -   rank  H    )    ≤  5.        k     rank  G    rank  H     5.    k-(\operatorname{rank}G-\operatorname{rank}H)\leq 5.     In a related conjecture, "positive" is replaced with "nonnegative".  Riemannian symmetric spaces   A compact symmetric space of rank greater than one cannot carry a Riemannian metric of positive sectional curvature.    In particular, the four-dimensional manifold S 2 × S 2 should admit no Riemannian metric with positive sectional curvature.  Aspherical manifolds   ''Suppose M 2 k is a closed, aspherical manifold of even dimension. Then its Euler characteristic satisfies the inequality''            (   -  1   )   k   χ   (   M   2  k    )    ≥  0.         superscript    1   k   χ   superscript  M    2  k     0.    (-1)^{k}\chi(M^{2k})\geq 0.        This topological version of Hopf conjecture for Riemannian manifolds is due to William Thurston . Ruth Charney and Mike Davis conjectured that the same inequality holds for a nonpositively curved piecewise Euclidean (PE) manifold.  Metrics with no conjugate points   A Riemannian metric without conjugate points on n-dimensional torus is flat.    Proved by D. Burago and S.
