   Sard's theorem      Sard's theorem   Sard's theorem , also known as Sard's lemma or the Morse–Sard theorem , is a result in mathematical analysis which asserts that the set of critical values (that is, the image of the set of critical points ) of a smooth function  f from one Euclidean space or manifold to another is a null set , i.e., it has Lebesgue measure 0. This makes the set of critical values "small" in the sense of a generic property . The theorem is named for Anthony Morse and Arthur Sard .  Statement  More explicitly (; ), let      f  :    ℝ  n   →   ℝ  m       normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  n    superscript  ℝ  m      f\colon\mathbb{R}^{n}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}^{m}     be    C  k     superscript  C  k    C^{k}   , (that is,   k   k   k   times continuously differentiable ), where    k  ≥   max   {    n  -  m   +  1   ,  1  }        k        n  m   1   1     k\geq\max\{n-m+1,1\}   . Let   X   X   X   denote the critical set of    f  ,    f   f,   which is the set of points    x  ∈   ℝ  n       x   superscript  ℝ  n     x\in\mathbb{R}^{n}   at which the Jacobian matrix of   f   f   f   has rank  . Then the image     f   (  X  )       f  X    f(X)   has Lebesgue measure 0 in    ℝ  m     superscript  ℝ  m    \mathbb{R}^{m}   .  Intuitively speaking, this means that although   X   X   X   may be large, its image must be small in the sense of Lebesgue measure: while   f   f   f   may have many critical points in the domain    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   , it must have few critical values in the image    ℝ  m     superscript  ℝ  m    \mathbb{R}^{m}   .  More generally, the result also holds for mappings between second countable  differentiable manifolds    M   M   M   and   N   N   N   of dimensions   m   m   m   and   n   n   n   , respectively. The critical set   X   X   X   of a    C  k     superscript  C  k    C^{k}   function      f  :   N  →  M      normal-:  f   normal-→  N  M     f:N\rightarrow M   consists of those points at which the differential       d  f   :    T  N   →   T  M       normal-:    d  f    normal-→    T  N     T  M      df:TN\rightarrow TM   has rank less than   m   m   m   as a linear transformation. If    k  ≥   max   {    n  -  m   +  1   ,  1  }        k        n  m   1   1     k\geq\max\{n-m+1,1\}   , then Sard's theorem asserts that the image of   X   X   X   has measure zero as a subset of   M   M   M   . This formulation of the result follows from the version for Euclidean spaces by taking a countable set of coordinate patches. The conclusion of the theorem is a local statement, since a countable union of sets of measure zero is a set of measure zero, and the property of a subset of a coordinate patch having zero measure is invariant under diffeomorphism .  Variants  There are many variants of this lemma, which plays a basic role in singularity theory among other fields. The case    m  =  1      m  1    m=1   was proven by Anthony P. Morse in 1939 , and the general case by Arthur Sard in 1942 .  A version for infinite-dimensional Banach manifolds was proven by Stephen Smale .  The statement is quite powerful, and the proof is involved analysis. In topology it is often quoted — as in the Brouwer fixed point theorem and some applications in Morse theory — in order to use the weaker corollary that “a non-constant smooth map has a regular value”.  In 1965 Sard further generalized his theorem to state that if    f  :   M  →  N      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  N     f:M\rightarrow N   is    C  k     superscript  C  k    C^{k}   for    k  ≥   max   {    n  -  m   +  1   ,  1  }        k        n  m   1   1     k\geq\max\{n-m+1,1\}   and if     A  r   ⊆  M       subscript  A  r   M    A_{r}\subseteq M   is the set of points    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   such that    d   f  x       d   subscript  f  x     df_{x}   has rank strictly less than   r   r   r   , then the r-dimensional Hausdorff measure of    f   (   A  r   )       f   subscript  A  r     f(A_{r})   is zero. In particular the Hausdorff dimension of    f   (   A  r   )       f   subscript  A  r     f(A_{r})   is at most r. Caveat: The Hausdorff dimension of    f   (   A  r   )       f   subscript  A  r     f(A_{r})   can be arbitrarly close to r. 1  See also   Generic property   References    .   .   .   and also .   .
