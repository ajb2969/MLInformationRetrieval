Zubov's method

Zubov's method is a technique for computing the basin of attraction for a set of ordinary differential equations (a dynamical system). The domain of attraction is the set 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the solution to a partial differential equation known as the Zubov equation. 'Zubov's method' can be used in a number of ways.
Zubov's theorem states that:

If 
 
 
 
  is an ordinary differential equation in 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , a set 
 
 
 
  containing 0 in its interior is the domain of attraction of zero if and only if there exist continuous functions 
 
 
 
  such that:
 


 
 , 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 

for every 
 
 
 
  there exist 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  , if 
 
 



 
  for 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 







If f is continuously differentiable, then the differential equation has at most one continuously differentiable solution satisfying 
 
 
 
 .
