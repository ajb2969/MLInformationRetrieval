   Zubov's method      Zubov's method   Zubov's method is a technique for computing the basin of attraction for a set of ordinary differential equations (a dynamical system ). The domain of attraction is the set    {  x  :    v   (  x  )    <  1   }     conditional-set  x      v  x   1     \{x:\,v(x)<1\}   , where    v   (  x  )       v  x    v(x)   is the solution to a partial differential equation known as the Zubov equation . 'Zubov's method' can be used in a number of ways.  Zubov's theorem states that:   If      x  ′   =   f   (  x  )     ,   t  ∈   \R       formulae-sequence     superscript  x  normal-′     f  x      t  \R     x^{\prime}=f(x),t\in\R   is an ordinary differential equation in     \R   n     superscript  \R  n    \R^{n}   with     f   (  0  )    =  0        f  0   0    f(0)=0   , a set   A   A   A   containing 0 in its interior is the domain of attraction of zero if and only if there exist continuous functions    v  ,  h     v  h    v,h   such that:       v   (  0  )    =   h   (  0  )    =  0          v  0     h  0        0     v(0)=h(0)=0   ,    0  <   v   (  x  )    <  1        0    v  x        1     0   for    x  ∈   A  ∖   {  0  }        x    A   0      x\in A\setminus\{0\}   ,    h  >  0      h  0    h>0   on      \R   n   ∖   {  0  }        superscript  \R  n    0     \R^{n}\setminus\{0\}     for every     γ  2   >  0       subscript  γ  2   0    \gamma_{2}>0   there exist      γ  1   >  0   ,    α  1   >  0      formulae-sequence     subscript  γ  1   0      subscript  α  1   0     \gamma_{1}>0,\alpha_{1}>0   such that      v   (  x  )    >   γ  1    ,    h   (  x  )    >   α  1       formulae-sequence      v  x    subscript  γ  1        h  x    subscript  α  1      v(x)>\gamma_{1},h(x)>\alpha_{1}   , if     ||  x  ||   >   γ  2        norm  x    subscript  γ  2     ||x||>\gamma_{2}          v   (   x  n   )    →  1     normal-→    v   subscript  x  n    1    v(x_{n})\rightarrow 1   for     x  n   →   ∂  A      normal-→   subscript  x  n     A     x_{n}\rightarrow\partial A   or     ||   x  n   ||   →  ∞     normal-→   norm   subscript  x  n       ||x_{n}||\rightarrow\infty             ∇  v    (  x  )    ⋅  f    (  x  )    =   -   h   (  x  )    (   1  -   v   (  x  )     )     1  +    ||   f   (  x  )    ||   2              normal-⋅     normal-∇  v   x   f   x       h  x    1    v  x        1   superscript   norm    f  x    2         \nabla v(x)\cdot f(x)=-h(x)(1-v(x))\sqrt{1+||f(x)||^{2}}        If f is continuously differentiable, then the differential equation has at most one continuously differentiable solution satisfying     v   (  0  )    =  0        v  0   0    v(0)=0   .
