   Dehn–Sommerville equations      Dehn–Sommerville equations   In mathematics, the Dehn–Sommerville equations are a complete set of linear relations between the numbers of faces of different dimension of a simplicial polytope . For polytopes of dimension 4 and 5, they were found by Max Dehn in 1905. Their general form was established by Duncan Sommerville in 1927. The Dehn–Sommerville equations can be restated as a symmetry condition for the h -vector'' of the simplicial polytope and this has become the standard formulation in recent combinatorics literature. By duality, analogous equations hold for simple polytopes .  Statement  Let P be a d -dimensional simplicial polytope . For i = 0, 1, ..., d −1, let f i denote the number of i -dimensional faces of P . The sequence       f   (  P  )    =   (   f  0   ,   f  1   ,  …  ,   f   d  -  1    )         f  P     subscript  f  0    subscript  f  1   normal-…   subscript  f    d  1       f(P)=(f_{0},f_{1},\ldots,f_{d-1})     is called the f -vector of the polytope P . Additionally, set        f   -  1    =  1   ,    f  d   =  1.      formulae-sequence     subscript  f    1    1      subscript  f  d   1.     f_{-1}=1,f_{d}=1.     Then for any k = −1, 0, …, d −2, the following Dehn–Sommerville equation holds:         ∑   j  =  k    d  -  1       (   -  1   )   j    (      j  +  1        k  +  1      )    f  j     =     (   -  1   )    d  -  1     f  k     .        superscript   subscript     j  k      d  1       superscript    1   j    binomial    j  1     k  1     subscript  f  j        superscript    1     d  1     subscript  f  k      \sum_{j=k}^{d-1}(-1)^{j}{\left({{j+1}\atop{k+1}}\right)}f_{j}=(-1)^{d-1}f_{k}.     When k = −1, it expresses the fact that Euler characteristic of a ( d − 1)-dimensional simplicial sphere is equal to 1 + (−1) d −1 .  Dehn–Sommerville equations with different k are not independent. There are several ways to choose a maximal independent subset consisting of    [    d  +  1   2   ]     delimited-[]      d  1   2     \left[\frac{d+1}{2}\right]   equations. If d is even then the equations with k = 0, 2, 4, …, d −2 are independent. Another independent set consists of the equations with k = −1, 1, 3, …, d −3. If d is odd then the equations with k = −1, 1, 3, …, d −2 form one independent set and the equations with k = −1, 0, 2, 4, …, d −3 form another.  Equivalent formulations  Sommerville found a different way to state these equations:         ∑   i  =   -  1     k  -  1       (   -  1   )    d  +  i     (       d  -  i  -  1        d  -  k       )    f  i     =    ∑   i  =   -  1     d  -  k  -  1       (   -  1   )   i    (       d  -  i  -  1       k      )    f  i      ,        superscript   subscript     i    1       k  1       superscript    1     d  i     binomial    d  i  1     d  k     subscript  f  i       superscript   subscript     i    1       d  k  1       superscript    1   i    binomial    d  i  1   k    subscript  f  i       \sum_{i=-1}^{k-1}(-1)^{d+i}{\left({{d-i-1}\atop{d-k}}\right)}f_{i}=\sum_{i=-1}%
 ^{d-k-1}(-1)^{i}{\left({{d-i-1}\atop{k}}\right)}f_{i},     where 0 ≤ k ≤ ½(d−1). This can be further facilitated introducing the notion of h -vector of P . For k = 0, 1, …, d , let        h  k   =    ∑   i  =  0   k      (   -  1   )    k  -  i     (      d  -  i        k  -  i      )    f   i  -  1       .       subscript  h  k     superscript   subscript     i  0    k      superscript    1     k  i     binomial    d  i     k  i     subscript  f    i  1        h_{k}=\sum_{i=0}^{k}(-1)^{k-i}{\left({{d-i}\atop{k-i}}\right)}f_{i-1}.     The sequence       h   (  P  )    =   (   h  0   ,   h  1   ,  …  ,   h  d   )         h  P     subscript  h  0    subscript  h  1   normal-…   subscript  h  d      h(P)=(h_{0},h_{1},\ldots,h_{d})     is called the h -vector of P . The f -vector and the h -vector uniquely determine each other through the relation         ∑   i  =  0   d     f   i  -  1      (   t  -  1   )    d  -  i      =    ∑   k  =  0   d     h  k    t   d  -  k       .        superscript   subscript     i  0    d      subscript  f    i  1     superscript    t  1     d  i        superscript   subscript     k  0    d      subscript  h  k    superscript  t    d  k        \sum_{i=0}^{d}f_{i-1}(t-1)^{d-i}=\sum_{k=0}^{d}h_{k}t^{d-k}.     Then the Dehn–Sommerville equations can be restated simply as         h  k   =    h   d  -  k    for     0  ≤  k  ≤  d    .     formulae-sequence     subscript  h  k     subscript  h    d  k    for        0  k       d      h_{k}=h_{d-k}\quad\textrm{for}\quad 0\leq k\leq d.     The equations with 0 ≤ k ≤ ½(d−1) are independent, and the others are manifestly equivalent to them.  Richard Stanley gave an interpretation of the components of the h -vector of a simplicial convex polytope P in terms of the projective  toric variety  X associated with (the dual of) P . Namely, they are the dimensions of the even intersection cohomology groups of X :       h  k   =     dim  ℚ    IH   2  k      (  X  ,  ℚ  )         subscript  h  k      subscript  dim  ℚ    superscript  IH    2  k     X  ℚ     h_{k}=\operatorname{dim}_{\mathbb{Q}}\operatorname{IH}^{2k}(X,\mathbb{Q})     (the odd intersection cohomology groups of X are all zero). In this language, the last form of the Dehn–Sommerville equations, the symmetry of the h -vector, is a manifestation of the Poincaré duality in the intersection cohomology of X .
