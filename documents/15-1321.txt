TRNA:m4X modification enzyme

TRNA:m4X modification enzyme (, TRM13, Trm13p, tRNA:Xm4 modification enzyme) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNAPro/His/Gly(GCC) (cytidine/adenosine4-2'-O)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine4 in tRNAPro 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine4 in tRNAPro
 
(2) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytidine4 in tRNAGly(GCC) 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylcytidine4 in tRNAGly(GCC)
 
(3) S-adenosyl-L-methionine + adenosine4 in tRNAHis 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methyladenosine4 in tRNAHis
 

The enzyme from Saccharomyces cerevisiae 2'-O-methylates cytidine4 in tRNAPro and tRNAGly(GCC), and adenosine4 in tRNAHis.
