   Mass attenuation coefficient      Mass attenuation coefficient   The mass attenuation coefficient or mass narrow beam attenuation coefficient of the volume of a material characterizes how easily it can be penetrated by a beam of light , sound , particles , or other energy or matter . 1 In addition to visible light, mass attenuation coefficients can be defined for other electromagnetic radiation (such as X-rays ), sound , or any other beam that attenuates. The SI unit of mass attenuation coefficient is the square metre per kilogram ( ). Other common units include cm 2 /g (the most common unit for X-ray mass attenuation coefficients) and mL⋅g −1 ⋅cm −1 (sometimes used in solution chemistry). "Mass extinction coefficient" is an old term for this quantity. 2  The mass attenuation coefficient can be thought of as a variant of absorption cross section where the effective area is defined per unit mass instead of per particle.  Mathematical definitions  Mass attenuation coefficient  Mass attenuation coefficient is defined as       μ   ρ  m    ,      μ   subscript  ρ  m     \frac{\mu}{\rho_{m}},   where   μ is the attenuation coefficient ;  ρ m is the mass density .   Mass absorption and scattering coefficients  When a narrow ( collimated ) beam passes through a volume, the beam will lose intensity due to two processes: absorption and scattering .  Mass absorption coefficient , and mass scattering coefficient are defined as         μ  a    ρ  m    ,    μ  s    ρ  m     ,        subscript  μ  normal-a    subscript  ρ  m       subscript  μ  normal-s    subscript  ρ  m      \frac{\mu_{\mathrm{a}}}{\rho_{m}},\quad\frac{\mu_{\mathrm{s}}}{\rho_{m}},   where   μ a is the absorption coefficient;  μ s is the scattering coefficient.   In solutions  In chemistry, mass attenuation coefficients are often used for a chemical species dissolved in a solution . In that case, the mass attenuation coefficient is defined by the same equation, except that the "density" is the density of only that one chemical species, and the "attenuation" is the attenuation due to only that one chemical species. The actual  attenuation coefficient is computed by       μ  =     (   μ  /   ρ  1    )    ρ  1    +    (   μ  /   ρ  2    )    ρ  2    +  …    ,      μ        μ   subscript  ρ  1     subscript  ρ  1        μ   subscript  ρ  2     subscript  ρ  2    normal-…     \mu=(\mu/\rho_{1})\rho_{1}+(\mu/\rho_{2})\rho_{2}+\ldots,   where each term in the sum is the mass attenuation coefficient and density of a different component of the solution (the solvent must also be included). This is a convenient concept because the mass attenuation coefficient of a species is approximately independent of its concentration (as long as certain assumptions are fulfilled).  A closely related concept is molar absorptivity . They are quantitatively related by   (mass attenuation coefficient) × ( molar mass ) = (molar absorptivity).   Mass attenuation coefficients for X-rays    Tables of photon  mass attenuation coefficients are essential in radiological physics, radiography (for medical and security purposes), dosimetry , diffraction , interferometry , crystallography and other branches of physics. The photons can be in form of X-ray , gamma-ray , and bremsstrahlung .  The values of mass attenuation coefficients are dependent upon the absorption and scattering of the incident radiation caused by several different mechanisms such as   Rayleigh scattering (coherent scattering);  Compton scattering (incoherent scattering);  photoelectric absorption ;  pair production , electron-positron production in the fields of the nucleus and atomic electrons.   The actual values have been thoroughly examined and are available to the general public through three databases run by National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST):   XAAMDI database;     XCOM database;     FFAST database.    Calculating the composition of a solution  If several known chemicals are dissolved in a single solution, the concentrations of each can be calculated using a light absorption analysis. First, the mass attenuation coefficients of each individual solute or solvent, ideally across a broad spectrum of wavelengths, must be measured or looked up. Second, the attenuation coefficient of the actual solution must be measured. Finally, using the formula       μ  =     (   μ  /   ρ  1    )    ρ  1    +    (   μ  /   ρ  2    )    ρ  2    +  …    ,      μ        μ   subscript  ρ  1     subscript  ρ  1        μ   subscript  ρ  2     subscript  ρ  2    normal-…     \mu=(\mu/\rho_{1})\rho_{1}+(\mu/\rho_{2})\rho_{2}+\ldots,   the spectrum can be fitted using ρ 1 , ρ 2 , … as adjustable parameters, since μ and each are functions of wavelength. If there are N solutes or solvents, this procedure requires at least  N measured wavelengths to create a solvable system of simultaneous equations , although using more wavelengths gives more reliable data.
