Glaisher–Kinkelin constant

In mathematics, the Glaisher–Kinkelin constant or Glaisher's constant, typically denoted A, is a mathematical constant, related to the K-function and the Barnes G-function. The constant appears in a number of sums and integrals, especially those involving Gamma functions and zeta functions. It is named after mathematicians James Whitbread Lee Glaisher and Hermann Kinkelin.
Its approximate value is:


 
    .
The Glaisher–Kinkelin constant 
 
 
 
  can be given by the limit:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the K-function. This formula displays a similarity between A and 
 
 
 
  which is perhaps best illustrated by noting Stirling's formula:


 
  which shows that just as 
 
 
 
  is obtained from approximation of the function 
 
 
 
 , A can also be obtained from a similar approximation to the function 
 
 
 
 .
 An equivalent definition for A involving the Barnes G-function, given by 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the gamma function is:


 
 . The Glaisher–Kinkelin constant also appears in evaluations of the derivatives of the Riemann zeta function, such as:





 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the Euler–Mascheroni constant. The latter formula leads directly to the following product found by Glaisher:


 
  The following are some integrals that involve this constant:





 
  A series representation for this constant follows from a series for the Riemann zeta function given by Helmut Hasse.
