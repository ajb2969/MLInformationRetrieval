Symmetric set




Symmetric set

In mathematics, a nonempty subset S of a group G is said to be symmetric if


 
  where 
 
 
 
 . In other words, S is symmetric if 
 
 
 
  whenever 
 
 
 
 .
If S is a subset of a vector space, then S is said to be symmetric if it is symmetric with respect to the additive group structure of the vector space; that is, if 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

In R, examples of symmetric sets are intervals of the type 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , and the sets Z and 
 
 
 
 .
Any vector subspace in a vector space is a symmetric set.
If S is any subset of a group, then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are symmetric sets.
