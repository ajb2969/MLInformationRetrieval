   Symmetric set      Symmetric set   In mathematics, a nonempty subset S of a group  G is said to be symmetric if      S  =   S   -  1        S   superscript  S    1      S=S^{-1}   where     S   -  1    =   {   x   -  1    :   x  ∈  S   }        superscript  S    1     conditional-set   superscript  x    1      x  S      S^{-1}=\{x^{-1}:x\in S\}   . In other words, S is symmetric if     x   -  1    ∈  S       superscript  x    1    S    x^{-1}\in S   whenever    x  ∈  S      x  S    x\in S   .  If S is a subset of a vector space , then S is said to be symmetric if it is symmetric with respect to the additive group structure of the vector space; that is, if    S  =   -  S   =   {   -  x   :   x  ∈  S   }         S    S         conditional-set    x     x  S       S=-S=\{-x:x\in S\}   .  Examples   In R , examples of symmetric sets are intervals of the type    (   -  k   ,  k  )       k   k    (-k,k)   with    k  >  0      k  0    k>0   , and the sets Z and    {   -  1   ,  1  }       1   1    \{-1,1\}   .  Any vector subspace in a vector space is a symmetric set.  If S is any subset of a group, then    S   S   -  1        S   superscript  S    1      SS^{-1}   and     S   -  1    S       superscript  S    1    S    S^{-1}S   are symmetric sets.
