Dini derivative

In mathematics and, specifically, real analysis, the Dini derivatives (or Dini derivates) are a class of generalizations of the derivative. They were introduced by Ulisse Dini.
The upper Dini derivative, which is also called an upper right-hand derivative,1 of a continuous function



is denoted by 
 
 
 
  and defined by



where 
 
 
 
 
  is the supremum limit and the limit is a one-sided limit. The lower Dini derivative, 
 
 
 
 , is defined by



where 
 
 
 
  is the infimum limit.
If 
 
 
 
  is defined on a vector space, then the upper Dini derivative at 
 
 
 
 
  in the direction 
 
 
 
  is defined by



If 
 
 
 
  is locally Lipschitz, then 
 
 
 
  is finite. If 
 
 
 
 
  is differentiable at 
 
 
 
 , then the Dini derivative at 
 
 
 
  is the usual derivative at 
 
 
 
 .
Remarks

Sometimes the notation 
 
 
 
  is used instead of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is used instead of

and




So when using the 
 
 
 
 
  notation of the Dini derivatives, the plus or minus sign indicates the left- or right-hand limit, and the placement of the sign indicates the infimum or supremum limit.


On the extended reals, each of the Dini derivatives always exist; however, they may take on the values 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  at times (i.e., the Dini derivatives always exist in the extended sense).
