Normal matrix

In mathematics, a complex square matrix

 
  is normal if



where  is the conjugate transpose of 
 
 
 
 . That is, a matrix is normal if it commutes with its conjugate transpose.
A real square matrix 
 
 
 
 
  satisfies  AT}}, and is therefore normal if  AAT}}.
Normality is a convenient test for diagonalizability: a matrix is normal if and only if it is unitarily similar to a diagonal matrix, and therefore any matrix 
 
 
 
  satisfying the equation  AA∗}} is diagonalizable.
The concept of normal matrices can be extended to normal operators on infinite dimensional Hilbert spaces and to normal elements in C*-algebras. As in the matrix case, normality means commutativity is preserved, to the extent possible, in the noncommutative setting. This makes normal operators, and normal elements of C*-algebras, more amenable to analysis.
Special cases
Among complex matrices, all unitary, Hermitian, and skew-Hermitian matrices are normal. Likewise, among real matrices, all orthogonal, symmetric, and skew-symmetric matrices are normal. However, it is not the case that all normal matrices are either unitary or (skew-)Hermitian. For example



is neither unitary, Hermitian, nor skew-Hermitian, yet it is normal because



Consequences

Proposition. A normal triangular matrix is diagonal.
 

Let 
 
 
 
  be a normal upper triangular matrix. Since  (AA∗)ii}}, one has  ⟨ei, AA*ei⟩}} i.e. the first row must have the same norm as the first column:



The first entry of row 1 and column 1 are the same, and the rest of column 1 is zero. This implies the first row must be zero for entries 2 through 
 
 
 
 . Continuing this argument for row–column pairs 2 through 
 
 
 
  shows 
 
 
 
  is diagonal.
The concept of normality is important because normal matrices are precisely those to which the spectral theorem applies:

Proposition. A matrix 
 
 
 
  is normal if and only if there exists a diagonal matrix

 
 
  and a unitary matrix

 
  such that  UΛU ∗}}.
 

The diagonal entries of 
 
 
 
  are the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 , and the columns of 
 
 
 
  are the eigenvectors of 
 
 
 
 
 . The matching eigenvalues in 
 
 
 
  come in the same order as the eigenvectors are ordered as columns of 
 
 
 
 .
Another way of stating the spectral theorem is to say that normal matrices are precisely those matrices that can be represented by a diagonal matrix with respect to a properly chosen orthonormal basis of . Phrased differently: a matrix is normal if and only if its eigenspaces span  and are pairwise orthogonal with respect to the standard inner product of .
The spectral theorem for normal matrices is a special case of the more general Schur decomposition which holds for all square matrices. Let 
 
 
 
  be a square matrix. Then by Schur decomposition it is unitary similar to an upper-triangular matrix, say, 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
 
  is normal, so is 
 
 
 
 . But then 
 
 
 
  must be diagonal, for, as noted above, a normal upper-triangular matrix is diagonal.
The spectral theorem permits the classification of normal matrices in terms of their spectra, for example:

Proposition. A normal matrix is unitary if and only if its spectrum is contained in the unit circle of the complex plane.
 


Proposition. A normal matrix is self-adjoint if and only if its spectrum is contained in 
 
 
 
 .
 

In general, the sum or product of two normal matrices need not be normal. However, the following holds:

Proposition. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are normal with 
 
 
 
 , then both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are also normal. Furthermore there exists a unitary matrix 
 
 
 
  such that  and  are diagonal matrices. In other words 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are simultaneously diagonalizable.
 

In this special case, the columns of  are eigenvectors of both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and form an orthonormal basis in . This follows by combining the theorems that, over an algebraically closed field, commuting matrices are simultaneously triangularizable and a normal matrix is diagonalizable – the added result is that these can both be done simultaneously.
Equivalent definitions
It is possible to give a fairly long list of equivalent definitions of a normal matrix. Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
 
  complex matrix. Then the following are equivalent:

The operator norm of a normal matrix 
 
 
 
  equals the numerical and spectral radii of 
 
 
 
 . (This fact generalizes to normal operators.) Explicitly, this means:









Some but not all of the above generalize to normal operators on infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces. For example, a bounded operator satisfying (9) is only quasinormal.
Analogy
It is occasionally useful (but sometimes misleading) to think of the relationships of different kinds of normal matrices as analogous to the relationships between different kinds of complex numbers:

Invertible matrices are analogous to non-zero complex numbers
The conjugate transpose is analogous to the complex conjugate
Unitary matrices are analogous to complex numbers on the unit circle
Hermitian matrices are analogous to real numbers
Hermitian positive definite matrices are analogous to positive real numbers
Skew Hermitian matrices are analogous to purely imaginary numbers

As a special case, the complex numbers may be embedded in the normal 
 
 
 
  real matrices by the mapping



which preserves addition and multiplication. It is easy to check that this embedding respects all of the above analogies.
