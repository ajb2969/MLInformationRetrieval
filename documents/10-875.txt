   2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate dehydrogenase      2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a 2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cis-5,6-dihydroxy-4-isopropylcyclohexa-1,3-dienecarboxylate + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cis-5,6-dihydroxy-4-isopropylcyclohexa-1,3-dienecarboxylate and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 2,3-dihydroxy-p-cumate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-2,3-dihydroxy-2,3-dihydro-p-cumate:NAD+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in biphenyl degradation .
