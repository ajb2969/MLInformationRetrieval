Core (graph theory)

In the mathematical field of graph theory, a core is a notion that describes behavior of a graph with respect to graph homomorphisms.
Definition
Graph 
 
 
 
  is a core if every homomorphism 
 
 
 
  is an isomorphism, that is it is a bijection of vertices of 
 
 
 
 .
A core of a graph 
 
 
 
  is a graph 
 
 
 
  such that

There exists a homomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 ,
there exists a homomorphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  is minimal with this property.

Two graphs are said to be homomorphism equivalent or hom-equivalent if they have isomorphic cores.
Examples

Any complete graph is a core.
A cycle of odd length is its own core.
Every two cycles of even length, and more generally every two bipartite graphs are hom-equivalent. The core of each of these graphs is the two-vertex complete graph K2.

Properties
Every graph has a core, which is determined uniquely, up to isomorphism. The core of a graph G is always an induced subgraph of G. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then the graphs 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are necessarily hom-equivalent.
