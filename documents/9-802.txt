   Core (graph theory)      Core (graph theory)   In the mathematical field of graph theory , a core is a notion that describes behavior of a graph with respect to graph homomorphisms .  Definition  Graph   G   G   G   is a core if every homomorphism    f  :   G  →  G      normal-:  f   normal-→  G  G     f:G\to G   is an isomorphism , that is it is a bijection of vertices of   G   G   G   .  A core of a graph   H   H   H   is a graph   G   G   G   such that   There exists a homomorphism from   H   H   H   to   G   G   G   ,  there exists a homomorphism from   G   G   G   to   H   H   H   , and     G   G   G   is minimal with this property.   Two graphs are said to be homomorphism equivalent or hom-equivalent if they have isomorphic cores.  Examples   Any complete graph is a core.  A cycle of odd length is its own core.  Every two cycles of even length, and more generally every two bipartite graphs are hom-equivalent. The core of each of these graphs is the two-vertex complete graph K 2 .   Properties  Every graph has a core, which is determined uniquely, up to isomorphism . The core of a graph G is always an induced subgraph of G . If    G  →  H     normal-→  G  H    G\to H   and    H  →  G     normal-→  H  G    H\to G   then the graphs   G   G   G   and   H   H   H   are necessarily hom-equivalent.
