   Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)      Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)   In number theory , Hurwitz's theorem , named after Adolf Hurwitz , gives a bound on a Diophantine approximation . The theorem states that for every irrational number  ξ there are infinitely many relatively prime integers m , n such that        |   ξ  -   m  n    |   <   1     5     n  2      .          ξ    m  n       1      5    superscript  n  2       \left|\xi-\frac{m}{n}\right|<\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}\,n^{2}}.     The hypothesis that ξ is irrational cannot be omitted. Moreover the constant    5      5    \scriptstyle\sqrt{5}   is the best possible; if we replace    5      5    \scriptstyle\sqrt{5}   by any number    A  >   5       A    5     \scriptstyle A>\sqrt{5}   and we let    ξ  =    (   1  +   5    )   /  2       ξ      1    5    2     \scriptstyle\xi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2   (the golden ratio ) then there exist only finitely many relatively prime integers m , n such that the formula above holds.
