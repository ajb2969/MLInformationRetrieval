Hurwitz's theorem (number theory)

In number theory, Hurwitz's theorem, named after Adolf Hurwitz, gives a bound on a Diophantine approximation. The theorem states that for every irrational number ξ there are infinitely many relatively prime integers m, n such that



The hypothesis that ξ is irrational cannot be omitted. Moreover the constant 
 
 
 
  is the best possible; if we replace 
 
 
 
  by any number 
 
 
 
  and we let 
 
 
 
  (the golden ratio) then there exist only finitely many relatively prime integers m, n such that the formula above holds.
