Chebyshev rational functions


This article is not about the Chebyshev rational functions used in the design of elliptic filters. For those functions, see Elliptic rational functions.


 In mathematics, the Chebyshev rational functions are a sequence of functions which are both rational and orthogonal. They are named after Pafnuty Chebyshev. A rational Chebyshev function of degree n is defined as:



where 
 
 
 
 
  is a Chebyshev polynomial of the first kind.
Properties
Many properties can be derived from the properties of the Chebyshev polynomials of the first kind. Other properties are unique to the functions themselves.
Recursion



Differential equations






Orthogonality

Plot of the absolute value of the seventh order (n = 7) Chebyshev rational function for x between 0.01 and 100. Note that there are n zeroes arranged symmetrically about x = 1 and if x0 is a zero, then 1/x0 is a zero as well. The maximum value between the zeros is unity. These properties hold for all orders.

Defining:



The orthogonality of the Chebyshev rational functions may be written:



where 
 
 
 
  equals 2 for n = 0 and 
 
 
 
  equals 1 for 
 
 
 
  and
