Leaky integrator

 In mathematics, a leaky integrator equation is a specific differential equation, used to describe a component or system that takes the integral of an input, but gradually leaks a small amount of input over time. It appears commonly in hydraulics, electronics, and neuroscience where it can represent either a single neuron or a local population of neurons.1 
This is equivalent to a 1st-order lowpass filter with cutoff frequency far below the frequencies of interest.2
Equation
The equation is of the form



where C is the input and A is the rate of the 'leak'.
General solution
Its general solution is



where k is a constant.
