   Leaky integrator      Leaky integrator   In mathematics , a leaky integrator equation is a specific differential equation , used to describe a component or system that takes the integral of an input, but gradually leaks a small amount of input over time. It appears commonly in hydraulics , electronics , and neuroscience where it can represent either a single neuron or a local population of neurons. 1   This is equivalent to a 1st-order lowpass filter with cutoff frequency far below the frequencies of interest. 2  Equation  The equation is of the form         d  x   /  d   t   =    -   A  x    +   C              d  x   d   t         A  x    C     dx/dt=-Ax+C\,     where C is the input and A is the rate of the 'leak' .  General solution  Its general solution is       x   (  t  )    =    k   e   -   A  t      +   C          x  t       k   superscript  e      A  t      C     x(t)=ke^{-At}+C\,     where k is a constant.
