   Sugawara theory      Sugawara theory   In theoretical physics , the Sugawara theory 1 is a set of formulae and theorems that allow one to construct a stress–energy tensor of a specific type of conformal field theory from a bilinear expression involving currents :        T   z  z     (  z  )    ∼    ∑  a     j  z  a    (  z  )    j  z  a    (  z  )        similar-to     subscript  T    z  z    z     subscript   a      subscript   superscript  j  a   z   z   subscript   superscript  j  a   z   z      T_{zz}(z)\sim\sum_{a}j^{a}_{z}(z)j^{a}_{z}(z)     References  "  Category:Conformal field theory     ↩
