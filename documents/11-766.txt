   N,N-dimethylformamidase      N,N-dimethylformamidase   In enzymology , a N,N-dimethylformamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N,N-dimethylformamide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dimethylamine + formate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N,N-dimethylformamide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are dimethylamine and formate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N,N-dimethylformamide amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include dimethylformamidase , and DMFase . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , iron .
