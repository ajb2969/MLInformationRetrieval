   Dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase      Dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a dolichyl-phosphate beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + dolichyl phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and dolichyl phosphate , whereas its two products are UDP and dolichyl beta-D-glucosyl phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:dolichyl-phosphate beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include polyprenyl phosphate:UDP-D-glucose glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose dolichyl-phosphate glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-dolichol glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose:dolichol phosphate glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose:dolicholphosphoryl glucosyltransferase , UDP-glucose:dolichyl monophosphate glucosyltransferase , and UDP-glucose:dolichyl phosphate glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in n-glycan biosynthesis .  References       "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
