Hardy–Littlewood zeta-function conjectures

In mathematics, the Hardy–Littlewood zeta-function conjectures, named after Godfrey Harold Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood, are two conjectures concerning the distances between zeros and the density of zeros of the Riemann zeta function.
In 1914 Godfrey Harold Hardy proved1 that the Riemann zeta function 
 
 
 
  has infinitely many real zeros.
Let 
 
 
 
  be the total number of real zeros, 
 
 
 
  be the total number of zeros of odd order of the function 
 
 
 
 , lying on the interval 
 
 
 
 .
Hardy and Littlewood claimed2 two conjectures. These conjectures – on the distance between real zeros of 
 
 
 
  and on the density of zeros of 
 
 
 
  on intervals 
 
 
 
  for sufficiently great 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and with as less as possible value of 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrarily small number – open two new directions in the investigation of the Riemann zeta function.
1. For any 
 
 
 
  there exists such 
 
 
 
  that for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the interval 
 
 
 
  contains a zero of odd order of the function 
 
 
 
 .
2. For any 
 
 
 
  there exist 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , such that for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the inequality 
 
 
 
  is true.
In 1942 Atle Selberg studied the problem 2 and proved that for any 
 
 
 
  there exists such 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , such that for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the inequality 
 
 
 
  is true.
In his turn, Selberg claim his conjecture3 that it's possible to decrease the value of the exponent 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  which was proved forty-two years later by A.A. Karatsuba.4
