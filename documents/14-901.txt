   Hardy–Littlewood zeta-function conjectures      Hardy–Littlewood zeta-function conjectures   In mathematics, the Hardy–Littlewood zeta-function conjectures , named after Godfrey Harold Hardy and John Edensor Littlewood , are two conjectures concerning the distances between zeros and the density of zeros of the Riemann zeta function .  In 1914 Godfrey Harold Hardy proved 1 that the Riemann zeta function    ζ   (    1  2   +   i  t    )       ζ      1  2     i  t      \zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)   has infinitely many real zeros.  Let    N   (  T  )       N  T    N(T)   be the total number of real zeros,     N  0    (  T  )        subscript  N  0   T    N_{0}(T)   be the total number of zeros of odd order of the function    ζ   (    1  2   +   i  t    )       ζ      1  2     i  t      \zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)   , lying on the interval    (  0  ,  T  ]     0  T    (0,T]   .  Hardy and Littlewood claimed 2 two conjectures. These conjectures – on the distance between real zeros of    ζ   (    1  2   +   i  t    )       ζ      1  2     i  t      \zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)   and on the density of zeros of    ζ   (    1  2   +   i  t    )       ζ      1  2     i  t      \zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)   on intervals    (  T  ,   T  +  H   ]     T    T  H     (T,T+H]   for sufficiently great    T  >  0      T  0    T>0   ,    H  =   T   a  +  ε        H   superscript  T    a  ε      H=T^{a+\varepsilon}   and with as less as possible value of    a  >  0      a  0    a>0   , where    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   is an arbitrarily small number – open two new directions in the investigation of the Riemann zeta function.  1. For any    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   there exists such     T  0   =    T  0    (  ε  )    >  0         subscript  T  0      subscript  T  0   ε        0     T_{0}=T_{0}(\varepsilon)>0   that for    T  ≥   T  0       T   subscript  T  0     T\geq T_{0}   and    H  =   T   0.25  +  ε        H   superscript  T    0.25  ε      H=T^{0.25+\varepsilon}   the interval    (  T  ,   T  +  H   ]     T    T  H     (T,T+H]   contains a zero of odd order of the function    ζ   (    1  2   +   i  t    )       ζ      1  2     i  t      \zeta\bigl(\tfrac{1}{2}+it\bigr)   .  2. For any    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   there exist     T  0   =    T  0    (  ε  )    >  0         subscript  T  0      subscript  T  0   ε        0     T_{0}=T_{0}(\varepsilon)>0   and    c  =   c   (  ε  )    >  0        c    c  ε        0     c=c(\varepsilon)>0   , such that for    T  ≥   T  0       T   subscript  T  0     T\geq T_{0}   and    H  =   T   0.5  +  ε        H   superscript  T    0.5  ε      H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}   the inequality       N  0    (   T  +  H   )    -    N  0    (  T  )     ≥   c  H            subscript  N  0     T  H       subscript  N  0   T      c  H     N_{0}(T+H)-N_{0}(T)\geq cH   is true.  In 1942 Atle Selberg studied the problem 2 and proved that for any    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   there exists such     T  0   =    T  0    (  ε  )    >  0         subscript  T  0      subscript  T  0   ε        0     T_{0}=T_{0}(\varepsilon)>0   and    c  =   c   (  ε  )    >  0        c    c  ε        0     c=c(\varepsilon)>0   , such that for    T  ≥   T  0       T   subscript  T  0     T\geq T_{0}   and    H  =   T   0.5  +  ε        H   superscript  T    0.5  ε      H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}   the inequality      N   (   T  +  H   )    -   N   (  T  )     ≥   c  H   log  T            N    T  H      N  T      c  H    T      N(T+H)-N(T)\geq cH\log T   is true.  In his turn, Selberg claim his conjecture 3 that it's possible to decrease the value of the exponent    a  =  0.5      a  0.5    a=0.5   for    H  =   T   0.5  +  ε        H   superscript  T    0.5  ε      H=T^{0.5+\varepsilon}   which was proved forty-two years later by A.A. Karatsuba . 4  References  "  Category:Conjectures  Category:Zeta and L-functions     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
