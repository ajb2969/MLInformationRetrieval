   Phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase      Phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase   In enzymology , a phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phytanoyl-CoA + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA + succinate + CO 2    (Figure)  Alpha oxidation part II.svg   The three substrates of this enzyme are phytanoyl-CoA , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its three products are 2-hydroxyphytanoyl-CoA , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of iron(II)-dependent oxygenases, which typically incorporate one atom of dioxygen into the substrate and one atom into the succinate carboxylate group. The mechanism is complex, but is believed to involve ordered binding of 2-oxoglutarate to the iron(II) containing enzyme followed by substrate. Binding of substrate causes displacement of a water molecule from the iron(II) cofactor, leaving a vacant coordination position to which dioxygen binds. A rearrangement occurs to form a high energy iron-oxygen species (which is generally thought to be an iron(IV)=O species) that performs the actual oxidation reaction.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is phytanoyl-CoA, 2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase .  Examples  In humans, phytanoyl-CoA hydroxylase is encoded by the PHYH ( aka PAHX ) gene and is required for the alpha-oxidation of branched chain fatty acids (e.g. phytanic acid ) in peroxisomes . PHYH deficiency results in the accumulation of large tissue stores of phytanic acid and is the major cause of Refsum disease . 1  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code . 2  related enzymes  Iron(II)-dependent oxygenases are widespread in micro-organisms, plants and animals are involved in many pathways of medical importance (the hypoxia response, carnitine biosynthesis, adult Refsum's disease) and biotechnological importance (most notably biosynthesis of cephalosporins, cephamycins and clavulanic acid). A sequence related enzyme, IPNS (which does not use 2-oxoglutarate) catalyses a key step in the biosynthesis of the penicillin nucleus.
