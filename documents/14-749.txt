   G-parity      G-parity   In theoretical physics , G-parity is a multiplicative quantum number that results from the generalization of C-parity to multiplets of particles.  C -parity applies only to neutral systems; in the pion triplet, only π 0 has C -parity. On the other hand, strong interaction does not see electrical charge , so it cannot distinguish amongst π + , π 0 and π − . We can generalize the C -parity so it applies to all charge states of a given multiplet:       𝒢   (      π  +        π  0        π  -      )    =    η  G    (      π  +        π  0        π  -      )          𝒢     superscript  π       superscript  π  0      superscript  π          subscript  η  G      superscript  π       superscript  π  0      superscript  π         \mathcal{G}\begin{pmatrix}\pi^{+}\\
 \pi^{0}\\
 \pi^{-}\end{pmatrix}=\eta_{G}\begin{pmatrix}\pi^{+}\\
 \pi^{0}\\
 \pi^{-}\end{pmatrix}   where η G = ±1 are the eigenvalues of G -parity. The G -parity operator is defined as      𝒢  =    𝒞    e   (   i  π   I  2    )         𝒢    𝒞   superscript  e    i  π   subscript  I  2        \mathcal{G}=\mathcal{C}\,e^{(i\pi I_{2})}     where   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   is the C -parity operator, and I 2 is the operator associated with the 2nd component of the isospin "vector". G -parity is a combination of charge conjugation and a π  rad (180°) rotation around the 2nd axis of isospin space. Given that charge conjugation and isospin are preserved by strong interactions, so is G . Weak and electromagnetic interactions, though, are not invariant under G -parity.  Since G -parity is applied on a whole multiplet, charge conjugation has to see the multiplet as a neutral entity. Thus, only multiplets with an average charge of 0 will be eigenstates of G , that is       Q  ¯   =   B  ¯   =   Y  ¯   =  0         normal-¯  Q    normal-¯  B         normal-¯  Y        0     \bar{Q}=\bar{B}=\bar{Y}=0     (see Q , B , Y ).  In general       η  G   =     η  C      (   -  1   )   I         subscript  η  G      subscript  η  C    superscript    1   I      \eta_{G}=\eta_{C}\,(-1)^{I}   where η C is a C -parity eigenvalue, and I is the isospin. For fermion-antifermion systems, we have       η  G   =     (   -  1   )    S  +  L  +  I          subscript  η  G    superscript    1     S  L  I      \eta_{G}=(-1)^{S+L+I}\,   . where S is the total spin , L the total orbital angular momentum quantum number . For boson–antiboson systems we have       η  G   =     (   -  1   )    L  +  I          subscript  η  G    superscript    1     L  I      \eta_{G}=(-1)^{L+I}\,   .
