One-dimensional space

 In physics and mathematics, a sequence of n numbers can be understood as a location in n-dimensional space. When , the set of all such locations is called a one-dimensional space. An example of a one-dimensional space is the number line, where the position of each point on it can be described by a single number.1

Polytopes
The only regular polytope in one dimension is the line segment, with the Schläfli symbol { }.
Hypersphere
The hypersphere in 1 dimension is a pair of points,2 sometimes called a 0-sphere as its surface is zero-dimensional. Its length is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the radius.
Coordinate systems in one-dimensional space
The most popular coordinate systems are the number line and the angle.
