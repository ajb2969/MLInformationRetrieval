Computable isomorphism

In computability theory two sets 
 
 
 
  of natural numbers are computably isomorphic or recursively isomorphic if there exists a total bijective computable function

 
  with 
 
 
 
 . By the theorem of Myhill,1 the relation of computable isomorphism coincides with the relation of one-one reduction.
Two numberings

 
  and 
 
 
 
  are called computably isomorphic if there exists a computable bijection 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 

Computably isomorphic numberings induce the same notion of computability on a set.
