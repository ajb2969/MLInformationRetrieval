   Computable isomorphism      Computable isomorphism   In computability theory two sets     A  ;  B   ⊆  𝒩       A  B   𝒩    A;B\subseteq\mathcal{N}   of natural numbers are computably isomorphic or recursively isomorphic if there exists a total  bijective  computable function     f  :   𝒩  →  𝒩      normal-:  f   normal-→  𝒩  𝒩     f\colon\mathcal{N}\to\mathcal{N}   with     f   (  A  )    =  B        f  A   B    f(A)=B   . By the theorem of Myhill, 1 the relation of computable isomorphism coincides with the relation of one-one reduction.  Two numberings    ν   ν   \nu   and   μ   μ   \mu   are called computably isomorphic if there exists a computable bijection   f   f   f   so that    ν  =   μ  ∘  f       ν    μ  f     \nu=\mu\circ f     Computably isomorphic numberings induce the same notion of computability on a set.
