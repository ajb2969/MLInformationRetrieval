Upper-convected time derivative

In continuum mechanics, including fluid dynamics, an upper-convected time derivative or Oldroyd derivative, named after James G. Oldroyd, is the rate of change of some tensor property of a small parcel of fluid that is written in the coordinate system rotating and stretching with the fluid.
The operator is specified by the following formula:


 
  where:



 
  is the upper-convected time derivative of a tensor field




 
  is the substantive derivative


 
  is the tensor of velocity derivatives for the fluid.

The formula can be rewritten as:



By definition the upper-convected time derivative of the Finger tensor is always zero.
The upper-convected derivative is widely use in polymer rheology for the description of behavior of a viscoelastic fluid under large deformations.
Examples for the symmetric tensor A
Simple shear
For the case of simple shear:



Thus,



Uniaxial extension of uncompressible fluid
In this case a material is stretched in the direction X and compresses in the direction s Y and Z, so to keep volume constant. The gradients of velocity are:



Thus,
