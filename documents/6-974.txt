   Superfield      Superfield   In theoretical physics , one often analyzes theories with supersymmetry in which superfields play a very important role. A superfield is a function defined in superspace which properly packages the various fields of a supermultiplet , namely, the array of fermion and boson fields related among themselves by supersymmetry . Superfields were introduced by Abdus Salam and John Strathdee in 1979. 1  Overview  In four dimensions, the simplest example—namely, the minimal N = 1 supersymmetry—may be written as a vector in a superspace with four extra fermionic coordinates     θ  1   ,   θ  2   ,    θ  ¯   1   ,    θ  ¯   2       superscript  θ  1    superscript  θ  2    superscript   normal-¯  θ   1    superscript   normal-¯  θ   2     \theta^{1},\theta^{2},\bar{\theta}^{1},\bar{\theta}^{2}   , transforming as a two-component spinor and its conjugate. More generally, there are 4N extra fermionic ( Grassmann number ) coordinates .  A more coordinate-free description of the superspace is that it's the quotient space of the super-Poincaré group divided by the Lorentz group .  Every superfield, i.e. a field that depends on all coordinates of the superspace (or in other words, an element of a module of the algebra of functions over superspace), may be expanded with respect to the new fermionic coordinates. There exists a special kind of superfields, the so-called chiral superfields , that, in the chiral representation of supersymmetry, depend only on the variables θ but not their conjugates. The last term in the corresponding expansion, namely    F   θ  1    θ  2       F   superscript  θ  1    superscript  θ  2     F\theta^{1}\theta^{2}   , is called the F-term . Other superfields include vector superfields .  There also exist superfields in theories with larger supersymmetry.  Manifestly supersymmetric actions may also be written as integrals over the whole superspace. Some special terms, such as the superpotential , may be written as integrals over θ s only. They are also referred to as F -terms, much like the terms in the ordinary potential that arise from these terms of the supersymmetric Lagrangian.
