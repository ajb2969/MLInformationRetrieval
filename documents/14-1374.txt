Continuous q-Jacobi polynomials

In mathematics, the continuous q-Jacobi polynomials P(x|q), introduced by , are a family of basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials in the basic Askey scheme.  give a detailed list of their properties.
Definition
The polynomials are given in terms of basic hypergeometric functions and the Pochhammer symbol by
