Proofs involving covariant derivatives

This article contains proof of formulas in Riemannian geometry that involve the Christoffel symbols.
Contracted Bianchi identities
Proof
Start with the Bianchi identity1


 
 .
Contract both sides of the above equation with a pair of metric tensors:











 
  The first term on the left contracts to yield a Ricci scalar, while the third term contracts to yield a mixed Ricci tensor,


 
  The last two terms are the same (changing dummy index n to m) and can be combined into a single term which shall be moved to the right,


 
  which is the same as


 
 . Swapping the index labels l and m yields

The covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor vanishes
Proof
The last equation in Proof 1 above can be expressed as


 
  where δ is the Kronecker delta. Since the mixed Kronecker delta is equivalent to the mixed metric tensor,


 
  and since the covariant derivative of the metric tensor is zero (so it can be moved in or out of the scope of any such derivative), then


 
  Factor out the covariant derivative


 
  then raise the index m throughout


 
  The expression in parentheses is the Einstein tensor, so 2


 
      Q.E.D.    (return to article)
this means that the covariant divergence of the Einstein tensor vanishes.
