Urethanase

In enzymology, an urethanase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

urethane + H2O 
 
 
 
  ethanol + CO2 + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are urethane and H2O, whereas its 3 products are ethanol, CO2, and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is urethane amidohydrolase (decarboxylating). This enzyme is also called urethane hydrolase.
