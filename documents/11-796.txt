   Urethanase      Urethanase   In enzymology , an urethanase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   urethane + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ethanol + CO 2 + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are urethane and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are ethanol , CO 2 , and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is urethane amidohydrolase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme is also called urethane hydrolase .
