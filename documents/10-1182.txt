   Metric space aimed at its subspace      Metric space aimed at its subspace   In mathematics , a metric space aimed at its subspace is a categorical construction that has a direct geometric meaning. It is also a useful step toward the construction of the metric envelope , or tight span , which are basic (injective) objects of the category of metric spaces .  Following , a notion of a metric space Y aimed at its subspace X is defined.  Informally, imagine terrain Y, and its part X, such that wherever in Y you place a sharpshooter, and an apple at another place in Y, and then let the sharpshooter fire, the bullet will go through the apple and will always hit a point of X, or at least it will fly arbitrarily close to points of X – then we say that Y is aimed at X.  A priori, it may seem plausible that for a given X the superspaces Y that aim at X can be arbitrarily large or at least huge. We will see that this is not the case. Among the spaces, which aim at a subspace isometric to X there is a unique ( up to  isometry ) universal one, Aim( X ), which in a sense of canonical isometric embeddings contains any other space aimed at (an isometric image of) X . And in the special case of an arbitrary compact metric space X every bounded subspace of an arbitrary metric space Y aimed at X is totally bounded (i.e. its metric completion is compact).  Definitions  Let    (  Y  ,  d  )     Y  d    (Y,d)   be a metric space. Let   X   X   X   be a subset of   Y   Y   Y   , so that    (  X  ,    d  |   X   )     X   evaluated-at  d  X     (X,d|_{X})   (the set   X   X   X   with the metric from   Y   Y   Y   restricted to   X   X   X   ) is a metric subspace of    (  Y  ,  d  )     Y  d    (Y,d)   . Then  Definition .  Space   Y   Y   Y   aims at   X   X   X   if and only if, for all points    y  ,  z     y  z    y,z   of   Y   Y   Y   , and for every real    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   , there exists a point   p   p   p   of   X   X   X   such that        |    d   (  p  ,  y  )    -   d   (  p  ,  z  )     |   >    d   (  y  ,  z  )    -  ϵ    .            d   p  y      d   p  z          d   y  z    ϵ     |d(p,y)-d(p,z)|>d(y,z)-\epsilon.     Let    Met   (  X  )       Met  X    \text{Met}(X)   be the space of all real valued metric maps (non-contractive) of   X   X   X   . Define        Aim   (  X  )    :=   {   f  ∈   Met   (  X  )     :      f   (  p  )    +   f   (  q  )     ≥   d   (  p  ,  q  )   for all  p    ,   q  ∈  X    }    .     assign    Aim  X    conditional-set    f   Met  X     formulae-sequence        f  p     f  q      d   p  q   for all  p      q  X       \text{Aim}(X):=\{f\in\operatorname{Met}(X):f(p)+f(q)\geq d(p,q)\text{ for all %
 }p,q\in X\}.     Then       d   (  f  ,  g  )    :=    sup   x  ∈  X     |    f   (  x  )    -   g   (  x  )     |    <  ∞       assign    d   f  g      subscript  supremum    x  X          f  x     g  x               d(f,g):=\sup_{x\in X}|f(x)-g(x)|<\infty     for every     f  ,  g   ∈   Aim   (  X  )         f  g     Aim  X     f,g\in\text{Aim}(X)   is a metric on    Aim   (  X  )       Aim  X    \text{Aim}(X)   . Furthermore,     δ  X   :   x  ↦   d  x       normal-:   subscript  δ  X    maps-to  x   subscript  d  x      \delta_{X}\colon x\mapsto d_{x}   , where      d  x    (  p  )    :=   d   (  x  ,  p  )       assign     subscript  d  x   p     d   x  p      d_{x}(p):=d(x,p)\,   , is an isometric embedding of   X   X   X   into    Aim   (  X  )      Aim  X    \operatorname{Aim}(X)   ; this is essentially a generalisation of the Kuratowski-Wojdysławski embedding of bounded metric spaces   X   X   X   into    C   (  X  )       C  X    C(X)   , where we here consider arbitrary metric spaces (bounded or unbounded). It is clear that the space    Aim   (  X  )      Aim  X    \operatorname{Aim}(X)   is aimed at     δ  X    (  X  )        subscript  δ  X   X    \delta_{X}(X)   .  Properties  Let    i  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  i   normal-→  X  Y     i\colon X\to Y   be an isometric embedding. Then there exists a natural metric map    j  :   Y  →   Aim   (  X  )        normal-:  j   normal-→  Y   Aim  X      j\colon Y\to\operatorname{Aim}(X)   such that     j  ∘  i   =   δ  X         j  i    subscript  δ  X     j\circ i=\delta_{X}   :          (   j   (  y  )    )    (  x  )    :=   d   (  x  ,  y  )       assign      j  y   x     d   x  y      (j(y))(x):=d(x,y)\,        for every    x  ∈   X       x  X    x\in X\,   and    y  ∈   Y       y  Y    y\in Y\,   .   Theorem The space Y above is aimed at subspace X if and only if the natural mapping    j  :   Y  →   Aim   (  X  )        normal-:  j   normal-→  Y   Aim  X      j\colon Y\to\operatorname{Aim}(X)   is an isometric embedding.   Thus it follows that every space aimed at X can be isometrically mapped into Aim(X), with some additional (essential) categorical requirements satisfied.  The space Aim(X) is injective (hyperconvex in the sense of Aronszajn -Panitchpakdi) – given a metric space M, which contains Aim(X) as a metric subspace, there is a canonical (and explicit) metric retraction of M onto Aim(X) .
