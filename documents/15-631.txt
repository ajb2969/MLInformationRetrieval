   Diffraction efficiency      Diffraction efficiency   Diffraction efficiency is the performance of diffractive optical elements – especially diffraction gratings – in terms of power throughput. It's a measure of how much optical power is diffracted into a designated direction compared to the power incident onto the diffractive element.  If the diffracted power is designated with   P   P   P   and the incident power with    P  0     subscript  P  0    P_{0}   the efficiency   η   η   \eta   reads       η  =    P   P  0      .      η    P   subscript  P  0      \eta=\frac{P}{P_{0}}\ .     Grating efficiency  In the most common case – the diffraction efficiency of optical gratings (therefore also called grating efficiency ) – there are two possibilities to specify efficiency: 1 2   The absolute efficiency is defined as above and relates the power diffracted into a particular order to the incident power.  The relative efficiency relates the power diffracted into a particular order to the power that would be reflected by a mirror of the same coating as the grating, therefore attributing to inevitable reflection losses at the grating but not caused by inefficient diffraction itself.
