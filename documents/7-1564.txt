   Brahmagupta's problem      Brahmagupta's problem   This problem was given in India by the mathematician Brahmagupta in 628 in his treatise Brahma Sputa Siddhanta :  solve the Pell equation        x  2   -   92   y  2     =  1.         superscript  x  2     92   superscript  y  2     1.    x^{2}-92y^{2}=1.     Brahmagupta gave the smallest solution as        (  x  ,  y  )   =   (  1151  ,  120  )    .       x  y    1151  120     (x,y)=(1151,120).
