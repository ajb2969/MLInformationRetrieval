   Pentagonal pyramidal number      Pentagonal pyramidal number   A pentagonal pyramidal number is a figurate number that represents the number of objects in a pyramid with a pentagonal base. 1 The n th pentagonal pyramidal number is equal to the sum of the first n  pentagonal numbers .  The first few pentagonal pyramidal numbers are:  1 , 6 , 18 , 40 , 75 , 126 , 196 , 288, 405, 550, 726, 936, 1183, 1470, 1800, 2176, 2601, 3078, 3610, 4200, 4851, 5566, 6348, 7200, 8125, 9126 .  The formula for the n th pentagonal pyramidal number is 2        n  2    (   n  +  1   )    2         superscript  n  2     n  1    2    \frac{n^{2}(n+1)}{2}     so the n th pentagonal pyramidal number is the average of n 2 and n 3 . 3 The n th pentagonal pyramidal number is also n times the n th  triangular number .  The generating function for the pentagonal pyramidal numbers is 4        x   (    2  x   +  1   )      (   x  -  1   )   4    .        x      2  x   1     superscript    x  1   4     \frac{x(2x+1)}{(x-1)^{4}}.
