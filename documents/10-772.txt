   Glycine N-methyltransferase      Glycine N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + glycine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + sarcosine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and glycine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and sarcosine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:glycine N-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include glycine methyltransferase , S-adenosyl-L-methionine:glycine methyltransferase , and GNMT . This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 12 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , and .
