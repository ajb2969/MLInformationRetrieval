   Overpressure      Overpressure   Overpressure (or blast overpressure ) is the pressure caused by a shock wave over and above normal atmospheric pressure . The shock wave may be caused by sonic boom or by explosion , and the resulting overpressure receives particular attention when measuring the effects of nuclear weapons or thermobaric bombs .  Effects of overpressure  According to an article in the journal Toxicological Sciences ,   "Blast overpressure (BOP), also known as high energy impulse noise, is a damaging outcome of explosive detonations and firing of weapons. Exposure to BOP shock waves alone results in injury predominantly to the hollow organ systems such as auditory, respiratory, and gastrointestinal systems." 1   An EOD suit worn by bomb disposal experts can protect against the deadly effects of BOP. 2      Overpressure   Effects 3        Reinforced concrete buildings severely damaged  Severe heart and lung damage  Limbs can be blown off      |   Most buildings collapse except concrete buildings  Injuries universal  Fatalities occur      |   Residential structures collapse  Brick walls destroyed  Injuries common  Fatalities may occur      Overpressure calculation (explosive)  Overpressure is determined using "Weibull's formula": 4 5      Δ  p   =   2410    (   m  V   )   0.72          normal-Δ  p     2410   superscript    m  V   0.72      \Delta p=2410\left({m\over V}\right)^{0.72}     where:   2410 is a constant based on      m    m   m\,   = net explosive mass calculated using all explosive materials and their relative effectiveness      V    V   V\,   = volume of given area (primarily used to determine volume within an enclosed space)   See also   Bomb disposal   References  "  Category:Pressure  Category:Explosives  Category:Shock waves     "Pulmonary Biochemical and Histological Alterations after Repeated Low-Level Blast Overpressure Exposures", Nabil M.
