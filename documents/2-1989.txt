   Gelfand–Naimark theorem      Gelfand–Naimark theorem   In mathematics , the Gelfand–Naimark theorem states that an arbitrary C*-algebra  A is isometrically *-isomorphic to a C*-algebra of bounded operators on a Hilbert space . This result was proven by Israel Gelfand and Mark Naimark in 1943 and was a significant point in the development of the theory of C*-algebras since it established the possibility of considering a C*-algebra as an abstract algebraic entity without reference to particular realizations as an operator algebra .  The Gelfand–Naimark representation π is the direct sum of representations π f of A where f ranges over the set of pure states of A and π f is the irreducible representation associated to f by the GNS construction . Thus the Gelfand–Naimark representation acts on the Hilbert direct sum of the Hilbert spaces H f by        π   (  x  )    [    ⊕  f    ξ  f    ]    =    ⊕  f     π  f    (  x  )    ξ  f      .        π  x   delimited-[]    subscript  direct-sum  f    subscript  ξ  f        subscript  direct-sum  f      subscript  π  f   x   subscript  ξ  f       \pi(x)[\bigoplus_{f}\xi_{f}]=\bigoplus_{f}\pi_{f}(x)\xi_{f}.     π( x ) is a bounded linear operator since it is the direct sum of a family of operators, each one having norm ≤ || x ||.  Theorem . The Gelfand–Naimark representation of a C*-algebra is an isometric *-representation.  It suffices to show the map π is injective , since for *-morphisms of C*-algebras injective implies isometric. Let x be a non-zero element of A . By the Krein extension theorem for positive linear functionals , there is a state f on A such that f ( z ) ≥ 0 for all non-negative z in A and f (− x * x ) f with cyclic vector ξ. Since       ∥    π  f    (  x  )   ξ   ∥   2     superscript   norm     subscript  π  f   x  ξ    2    \displaystyle\|\pi_{f}(x)\xi\|^{2}     it follows that π f ≠ 0. Injectivity of π follows.  The construction of Gelfand–Naimark representation depends only on the GNS construction and therefore it is meaningful for any Banach *-algebra  A having an approximate identity . In general it will not be a faithful representation . The closure of the image of π( A ) will be a C*-algebra of operators called the C*-enveloping algebra of A . Equivalently, we can define the C*-enveloping algebra as follows: Define a real valued function on A by        ∥  x  ∥    C  *    =    sup  f     f   (    x  *   x   )           subscript   norm  x    superscript  normal-C       subscript  supremum  f       f     superscript  x    x        \|x\|_{\operatorname{C}^{*}}=\sup_{f}\sqrt{f(x^{*}x)}   as f ranges over pure states of A . This is a semi-norm, which we refer to as the C* semi-norm of A . The set I of elements of A whose semi-norm is 0 forms a two sided-ideal in A closed under involution. Thus the quotient vector space  A / I is an involutive algebra and the norm      ∥  ⋅   ∥   C  *       fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to   superscript  normal-C       \|\cdot\|_{\operatorname{C}^{*}}     factors through a norm on A / I , which except for completeness, is a C* norm on A / I (these are sometimes called pre-C*-norms). Taking the completion of A / I relative to this pre-C*-norm produces a C*-algebra B .  By the Krein–Milman theorem one can show without too much difficulty that for x an element of the Banach *-algebra  A having an approximate identity:         sup   f  ∈   State   (  A  )       f   (    x  *   x   )     =    sup   f  ∈   PureState   (  A  )       f   (    x  *   x   )      .        subscript  supremum    f   State  A       f     superscript  x    x       subscript  supremum    f   PureState  A       f     superscript  x    x       \sup_{f\in\operatorname{State}(A)}f(x^{*}x)=\sup_{f\in\operatorname{PureState}%
 (A)}f(x^{*}x).   It follows that an equivalent form for the C* norm on A is to take the above supremum over all states.  The universal construction is also used to define universal C*-algebras of isometries.  Remark . The Gelfand representation or Gelfand isomorphism for a commutative C*-algebra with unit   A   A   A   is an isometric *-isomorphism from   A   A   A   to the algebra of continuous complex-valued functions on the space of multiplicative linear functionals, which in the commutative case are precisely the pure states, of A with the weak* topology.
