   Isoflavonoid synthase      Isoflavonoid synthase   2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase (, CYT93C , IFS , isoflavonoid synthase ) is an enzyme with systematic name liquiritigenin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating, aryl migration) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reactions :   liquiritigenin + O 2 + NADPH + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone + H 2 O + NADP +    and   (2S)- naringenin + O 2 + NADPH + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2,4',5,7-tetrahydroxyisoflavanone + H 2 O + NADP +    Isoflavonoid synthase requires cytochrome P450 .
