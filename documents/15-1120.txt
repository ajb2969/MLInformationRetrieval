Isoflavonoid synthase

2-hydroxyisoflavanone synthase (, CYT93C, IFS, isoflavonoid synthase) is an enzyme with systematic name liquiritigenin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating, aryl migration).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reactions:

liquiritigenin + O2 + NADPH + H+

 
  2,4',7-trihydroxyisoflavanone + H2O + NADP+


and

(2S)-naringenin + O2 + NADPH + H+

 
  2,4',5,7-tetrahydroxyisoflavanone + H2O + NADP+


Isoflavonoid synthase requires cytochrome P450.
