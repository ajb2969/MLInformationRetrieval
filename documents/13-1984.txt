   Heine–Stieltjes polynomials      Heine–Stieltjes polynomials   In mathematics, the Heine–Stieltjes polynomials or Stieltjes polynomials , introduced by , are polynomial solutions of a second-order Fuchsian equation , a differential equation all of whose singularities are regular . The Fuchsian equation has the form          d  2   S    d   z  2     +    (    ∑   j  =  1   N     γ  j    z  -   a  j      )     d  S    d  z     +     V   (  z  )      ∏   j  =  1   N    (   z  -   a  j    )     S    =  0             superscript  d  2   S     d   superscript  z  2         superscript   subscript     j  1    N      subscript  γ  j     z   subscript  a  j          d  S     d  z           V  z     superscript   subscript  product    j  1    N     z   subscript  a  j      S    0    \frac{d^{2}S}{dz^{2}}+\left(\sum_{j=1}^{N}\frac{\gamma_{j}}{z-a_{j}}\right)%
 \frac{dS}{dz}+\frac{V(z)}{\prod_{j=1}^{N}(z-a_{j})}S=0     for some polynomial V ( z ) of degree at most N − 2, and if this has a polynomial solution S then V is called a Van Vleck polynomial (after Edward Burr Van Vleck ) and S is called a Heine–Stieltjes polynomial.  Heun polynomials are the special cases of Stieltjes polynomials when the differential equation has four singular points.  References       "  Category:Polynomials
