Radonifying function

In measure theory, a radonifying function (ultimately named after Johann Radon) between measurable spaces is one that takes a cylinder set measure (CSM) on the first space to a true measure on the second space. It acquired its name because the pushforward measure on the second space was historically thought of as a Radon measure.
Definition
Given two separable Banach spaces

 
  and 
 
 
 
 , a CSM 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and a continuous linear map

 
 , we say that 
 
 
 
  is radonifying if the push forward CSM (see below) 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  "is" a measure, i.e. there is a measure 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that








for each 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the usual push forward of the measure 
 
 
 
  by the linear map 
 
 
 
 .
Push forward of a CSM
Because the definition of a CSM on 
 
 
 
  requires that the maps in 
 
 
 
  be surjective, the definition of the push forward for a CSM requires careful attention. The CSM








is defined by








if the composition

 
  is surjective. If 
 
 
 
  is not surjective, let 
 
 
 
  be the image of 
 
 
 
 , let 
 
 
 
  be the inclusion map, and define




 
 ,
 



where 
 
 
 
  (so 
 
 
 
 ) is such that
