   Characteristic velocity      Characteristic velocity   Characteristic velocity or    c  *     superscript  c     c^{*}   is a measure of the combustion performance of a rocket engine independent of nozzle performance, and is used to compare different propellants and propulsion systems .  Formula       c  *   =     p  1   ×   A  t     m  ˙         superscript  c         subscript  p  1    subscript  A  t     normal-˙  m      c^{*}=\frac{p_{1}\times A_{t}}{\dot{m}}          c  *     superscript  c     c^{*}   is the characteristic velocity (meters/second)      p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   is the chamber pressure (pascals)      A  t     subscript  A  t    A_{t}   is the area of the throat (square meters)      m  ˙     normal-˙  m    \dot{m}   is the mass flow rate of the engine (kilograms per second)   References   Rocket Propulsion Elements, 7th Edition by George P.
