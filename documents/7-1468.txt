Thyroid function tests

Thyroid function tests (TFTs) is a collective term for blood tests used to check the function of the thyroid.1
TFTs may be requested if a patient is thought to suffer from hyperthyroidism (overactive thyroid) or hypothyroidism (underactive thyroid), or to monitor the effectiveness of either thyroid-suppression or hormone replacement therapy. It is also requested routinely in conditions linked to thyroid disease, such as atrial fibrillation and anxiety disorder.
A TFT panel typically includes thyroid hormones such as thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) and thyroxine (T4), and triiodothyronine (T3) depending on local laboratory policy.
Thyroid hormones
Thyroid-stimulating hormone
Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH, thyrotropin) is generally elevated in hypothyroidism and decreased in hyperthyroidism.2
It is the most sensitive test for thyroid hormone function. TSH is produced in the pituitary gland. The production of TSH is controlled by TRH, which is produced in the hypothalamus. TSH levels may be suppressed by excess free T3 or free T4 in the blood.
Total thyroxine
Total thyroxine is rarely measured, having been largely superseded by free thyroxine tests. Total thyroxine (Total T4) is generally elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism.3 It is usually slightly elevated in pregnancy secondary to increased levels of thyroid binding globulin (TBG).4
Total T4 is measured to see the bound and unbound levels of T4. The total T4 is less useful in cases where there could be protein abnormalities. The total T4 is less accurate due to the large amount of T4 that is bound. The total T3 is measured in clinical practice since the T3 has decreased amount that is bound as compared to T4.
Reference ranges depend on the method of analysis. Results should always be interpreted using the range from the laboratory that performed the test. Example values are:

Carrier proteins
Thyroxine-binding globulin
An increased thyroxine-binding globulin results in an increased total thyroxine and total triiodothyronine without an actual increase in hormonal activity of thyroid hormones.

Protein binding function
Thyroid hormone uptake
Thyroid hormone uptake (Tuptake or T3 uptake) is a measure of the unbound thyroxine binding globulins in the blood, that is, the TBG that is unsaturated with thyroid hormone.66 Unsaturated TBG increases with decreased levels of thyroid hormones. It is not directly related to triiodothyronine, despite the name T3 uptake.67

Thyroid hormone binding ratio (THBR)
Thyroxine-binding index (TBI)

Mixed parameters
Free thyroxine index
The Free Thyroxine Index (FTI or T7) is obtained by multiplying the total T4 with Tuptake.74 FTI is considered to be a more reliable indicator of thyroid status in the presence of abnormalities in plasma protein binding.75 This test is rarely used now that reliable free thyroxine and free triiodothyronine assays are routinely available.
FTI is elevated in hyperthyroidism and decreased in hypothyroidism.76

Structure parameters
For special purposes, e.g. in diagnosis of nonthyroidal illness syndrome or central hypothyroidism, derived structure parameters that describe constant properties of the overall feedback control system, may add useful information.818283
Secretory capacity (GT)
Thyroid's secretory capacity (GT, also referred to as SPINA-GT) is the maximum stimulated amount of thyroxine the thyroid can produce in one second.84 GT is elevated in hyperthyroidism and reduced in hypothyroidism.85
GT is calculated with



or



 
 
 : Dilution factor for T4 (reciprocal of apparent volume of distribution, 0.1 l−1)

 
 : Clearance exponent for T4 (1.1e-6 sec−1)
K41: Dissociation constant T4-TBG (2e10 l/mol)
K42: Dissociation constant T4-TBPA (2e8 l/mol)
