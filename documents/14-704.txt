   B Integral      B Integral   In nonlinear optics , B-Integral is a measure of the nonlinear phase shift of light. It calculates the exponential growth of the least stable spatial frequency in a laser beam , and is the numerical equivalent of the nonlinear phase shift along the laser system's optical axis.  In a multipass laser system as a cumulative measure of the nonlinear interaction, 1 this integral is given by:      B  =     2  π   λ    ∫    n  2   I   (  z  )   d   z          B        2  π   λ        subscript  n  2   I  z  d  z       B=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}\int\!n_{2}I(z)\,dz\,     where    I   (  z  )       I  z    I(z)   is the optical intensity along the beam axis,   z   z   z   the position in beam direction, and    n  2     subscript  n  2    n_{2}   the nonlinear index quantifying the Kerr nonlinearity. As     n  2   I   (  z  )        subscript  n  2   I  z    n_{2}I(z)   is the nonlinear change in the refractive index, one easily recognizes the B integral to be the total on-axis nonlinear phase shift accumulated in a passage through the device. The B integral is frequently used in the context of ultrafast amplifiers, e.g. for optical components such as the Pockels cell of a regenerative amplifier.
