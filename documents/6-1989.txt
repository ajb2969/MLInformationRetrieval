   Ore extension      Ore extension   In mathematics , especially in the area of algebra known as ring theory , an Ore extension , named after Øystein Ore , is a special type of a ring extension whose properties are relatively well understood. Ore extensions appear in several natural contexts, including skew and differential polynomial rings , group algebras of polycyclic groups , universal enveloping algebras of solvable Lie algebras , and coordinate rings of quantum groups .  Definition  Suppose that R is a (not necessarily commutative) ring , σ : R → R is a ring homomorphism , and δ : R → R is a ''' σ -derivation''' of R , which means that δ is a homomorphism of abelian groups satisfying        δ   (    r  1    r  2    )    =    σ   (   r  1   )   δ   (   r  2   )    +   δ   (   r  1   )    r  2      .        δ     subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2         σ   subscript  r  1   δ   subscript  r  2      δ   subscript  r  1    subscript  r  2       \delta(r_{1}r_{2})=\sigma(r_{1})\delta(r_{2})+\delta(r_{1})r_{2}.     Then the Ore extension  R [ x ; σ , δ ], also called a skew polynomial ring , is the noncommutative ring obtained by giving the ring of polynomials  R [ x ] a new multiplication, subject to the identity        x  r   =    σ   (  r  )   x   +   δ   (  r  )      .        x  r       σ  r  x     δ  r      xr=\sigma(r)x+\delta(r).     If δ = 0 (i.e., is the zero map) then the Ore extension is denoted R [ x ; σ ]. If σ = 1 (i.e., the identity map) then the Ore extension is denoted R [ x , δ ] and is called a differential polynomial ring .  Examples  The Weyl algebras are Ore extensions, with R any a commutative polynomial ring , σ the identity ring endomorphism, and δ the polynomial derivative. Ore algebras are a class of iterated Ore extensions under suitable constraints that permit to develop a noncommutative extension of the theory of Gröbner bases .  Properties   An Ore extension of a domain is a domain.  An Ore extension of a skew field is a non-commutative Principal ideal domain .  If σ is an automorphism and R is a left Noetherian ring then the Ore extension R [ λ ; σ , δ ] is also left Noetherian.   Elements  An element f of an Ore ring R is called   twosided 1 (or invariant 2 ), if R·f = f·R , and  central , if g·f = f·g for all g ∈ R .
