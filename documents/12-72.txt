Størmer number

In mathematics, a Størmer number or arc-cotangent irreducible number, named after Carl Størmer, is a positive integer n for which the greatest prime factor of (n2 + 1) meets or exceeds 2n.
The first few Størmer numbers are:

1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, 15, 16, 19, 20, ... .
 

J. Todd proved that this sequence is neither finite nor cofinite.
The Størmer numbers arise in connection with the problem of representing the Gregory numbers (arctangents of rational numbers) 
 
 
 
 
  as sums of Gregory numbers for integers (arctangents of unit fractions). The Gregory number 
 
 
 
  may be decomposed by repeatedly multiplying the Gaussian integer

 
  by numbers of the form 
 
 
 
 , in order to cancel prime factors p from the imaginary part; here 
 
 
 
  is chosen to be a Størmer number such that 
 
 
 
 
  is divisible by
