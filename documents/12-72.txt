   Størmer number      Størmer number   In mathematics, a Størmer number or arc-cotangent irreducible number , named after Carl Størmer , is a positive integer n for which the greatest prime factor of ( n 2 + 1) meets or exceeds 2 n .  The first few Størmer numbers are:   1 , 2 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 19 , 20 , ... .   J. Todd proved that this sequence is neither finite nor cofinite .  The Størmer numbers arise in connection with the problem of representing the Gregory numbers ( arctangents of rational numbers )     G   a  /  b    =   arctan   b  a         subscript  G    a  b        b  a      G_{a/b}=\arctan\frac{b}{a}   as sums of Gregory numbers for integers (arctangents of unit fractions ). The Gregory number    G   a  /  b      subscript  G    a  b     G_{a/b}   may be decomposed by repeatedly multiplying the Gaussian integer     a  +   b  i       a    b  i     a+bi   by numbers of the form    n  ±  i     plus-or-minus  n  i    n\pm i   , in order to cancel prime factors p from the imaginary part; here   n   n   n   is chosen to be a Størmer number such that     n  2   +  1       superscript  n  2   1    n^{2}+1   is divisible by   p   p   p   . 1  Notes  References   John H.
