   Lie algebra extension      Lie algebra extension   In the theory of Lie groups , Lie algebras and their representation theory , a Lie algebra extension    𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is an enlargement of a given Lie algebra   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by another Lie algebra   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   . Extensions arise in several ways. There is the trivial extension obtained by taking a direct sum of two Lie algebras. Other types are the split extension and the central extension . Extensions may arise naturally, for instance, when forming a Lie algebra from projective group representations . Such a Lie algebra will contain central charges .  Starting with a polynomial loop algebra over finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra and performing two extensions, a central extension and an extension by a derivation, one obtains a Lie algebra which is isomorphic with an untwisted affine Kac–Moody algebra . Using the centrally extended loop algebra algebra one may construct a current algebra in two spacetime dimensions. The Virasoro algebra is the universal central extension of the Witt algebra . 1  Central extensions are needed in physics, because the symmetry group of a quantized system usually is a central extension of the classical symmetry group, and in the same way the corresponding symmetry Lie algebra of the quantum system is, in general, a central extension of the classical symmetry algebra. 2 Kac–Moody algebras have been conjectured to be a symmetry groups of a unified superstring theory. 3 The centrally extended Lie algebras algebras play a dominant role in quantum field theory , particularly in conformal field theory , string theory and in M-theory . 4 5  A large portion towards the end is devoted to background material for applications of Lie algebra extensions, both in mathematics and in physics, in areas where they are actually useful. A parenthetical link, ( background material ), is provided where it might be beneficial.  History  Due to the Lie correspondence , the theory, and consequently the history of Lie algebra extensions, is tightly linked to the theory and history of group extensions. A systematic study of group extensions was performed by the Austrian mathematician Otto Schreier in 1923 in his PhD. thesis and later published. 6 7 8 The problem posed for his thesis by Otto Hölder was "given two groups   G   G   G   and   H   H   H   , find all groups   E   E   E   having a normal subgroup   N   N   N   isomorphic to   G   G   G   such that the factor group    E  /  N      E  N    E/N   is isomorphic to   H   H   H   ".  Lie algebra extensions are most interesting and useful for infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. In 1967, Victor Kac and Robert Moody independently generalized the notion of classical Lie algebras, resulting in a new theory of infinite-dimensional Lie algebras algebras, now called Kac–Moody algebras . 9 10 They generalize the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebras and can often concretely be constructed as extensions. 11  Notation and proofs  Notational abuse to be found below includes for the exponential map     e  x  p      e  x  p    exp   given an argument, writing   g   g   g   for the element in a direct product    G  ×  H      G  normal-×  H    G×H   ( is the identity in   H   H   H   ), and analogously for Lie algebra direct sums (where also    g  +  h      g  h    g+h   and    (  g  ,  h  )     g  h    (g,h)   are used interchangeably). Likewise for semidirect products and semidirect sums. Canonical injections (both for groups and Lie algebras) are used for implicit identifications. Furthermore, if   G   G   G   ,   H   H   H   , ..., are groups, then the default names for elements of   G   G   G   ,   H   H   H   , ..., are   g   g   g   ,   h   h   h   , ..., and their Lie algebras are   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   ,   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   , ... . The default names for elements of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   ,   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   , ..., are   G   G   G   ,   H   H   H   , ... (just like for the groups!), partly to save scarce alphabetical resources but mostly to have a uniform notation.  Lie algebras that are ingredients in an extension will, without comment, be taken to be over the same field .  The summation convention applies, including sometimes when the indices involved are both upstairs or both downstairs.  Caveat: Not all proofs and proof outlines below have universal validity. The main reason is that the Lie algebras are often infinite-dimensional, and then there may or may not be a Lie group corresponding to the Lie algebra. Moreover, even if such a group exists, it may not have the "usual" properties, e.g. the exponential map might not exist, and if it does, it might not have all the "usual" properties. In such cases, it is questionable whether the group should be endowed with the "Lie" qualifier. The literature is not uniform. For the explicit examples, the relevant structures are supposedly in place.  Definition  Lie algebra extensions are formalized in terms of short exact sequences . 12 A short exact sequence is an exact sequence of length three,  such that   i   i   i   is a monomorphism ,   s   s   s   is an epimorphism , and     k  e  r  s   =   i  m  i         k  e  r  s     i  m  i     kers=imi   . From these properties of exact sequences, it follows that (the image of)   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   is an ideal in   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   . Moreover,       𝔤  ≅   𝔢  /   Im  i    =   𝔢  /   Ker  s     ,        𝔤    𝔢   Im  i           𝔢   Ker  s       \mathfrak{g}\cong\mathfrak{e}/\operatorname{Im}i=\mathfrak{e}/\operatorname{%
 Ker}s,   but it is not necessarily the case that   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is isomorphic to a subalgebra of   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   . This construction mirrors the analogous constructions in the closely related concept of group extensions .  If the situation in  prevails, non-trivially and for Lie algebras over the same field , then one says that   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is an extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   .  Properties  The defining property may be reformulated. The Lie algebra   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is an extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   if  is exact. Here the zeros on the ends represent the zero Lie algebra (containing the null vector    ∅   normal-∅   ∅   only) and the maps are the obvious ones;   ί   ί   ί   maps   ∅   normal-∅   ∅   to   ∅   normal-∅   ∅   and   σ   σ   σ   maps all elements of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   to   ∅   normal-∅   ∅   . With this definition, it follows automatically that   i   i   i   is a monomorphism and   s   s   s   is an epimorphism.  An extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   is not necessarily unique. Let denote two extensions and let the primes below have the obvious interpretation. Then, if there exists a Lie algebra isomorphism such that         f  ∘  i   =   i  ′    ,     s  ′   ∘  f   =  s    ,     formulae-sequence      f  i    superscript  i  normal-′         superscript  s  normal-′   f   s     f\circ i=i^{\prime},\quad s^{\prime}\circ f=s,   then the extensions   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   and are said to be equivalent extensions . Equivalence of extensions is an equivalence relation .

An ideal is a subalgebra, but a subalgebra is not necessarily and ideal. A trivial extension is thus a split extension.  Central  Central extensions of a Lie algebra   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by an abelian Lie algebra   𝐚   𝐚   \mathbf{a}   can be obtained with the help of a so-called (nontrivial) 2-cocycle ( background ) on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . Non-trivial 2-cocycles occur in the context of projective representations ( background ) of Lie groups. This is alluded to further down.

Properties   Since the center commutes with everything,     𝐡  ≅  i  m  i   =   k  e  r  s         𝐡  normal-≅  i  m  i     k  e  r  s     \mathbf{h}≅imi=kers   in this case is abelian .  Given a central extension   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   , one may construct a 2-cocycle on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . Suppose   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is a central extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   .

Use this section to define    ε  :   𝐠  ×  𝐠  →  𝐞      normal-:  ε    𝐠  normal-×  𝐠  normal-→  𝐞     ε:\mathbf{g}×\mathbf{g}→\mathbf{e}   by          ϵ   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )    =     l   (   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   )    -   [   l   (   G  1   )    ,   l   (   G  2   )    ]    ,   G  1     ,    G  2   ∈  𝔤    .     formulae-sequence      ϵ    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2          l    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2        l   subscript  G  1      l   subscript  G  2       subscript  G  1        subscript  G  2   𝔤     \epsilon(G_{1},G_{2})=l([G_{1},G_{2}])-[l(G_{1}),l(G_{2})],\quad G_{1},G_{2}%

Use Jacobi identity on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   to get rid of half of the six terms. Use the definition of   ε   ε   ε   again on terms sitting inside three Lie brackets, bilinearity of Lie brackets, and the Jacobi identity on   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   , and then finally use on the three remaining terms that    I  m  ε  ⊂  k  e  r  s      I  m  ε  normal-⊂  k  e  r  s    Imε⊂kers   and that    k  e  r  s  ⊂  Z   (  𝐞  )       k  e  r  s  normal-⊂  Z  𝐞    kers⊂Z(\mathbf{e})   so that brackets to zero with everything.

Construction  By direct sum  Let    𝐠  ,  𝐡     𝐠  𝐡    \mathbf{g},\mathbf{h}   be Lie algebras over the same field   K   K   K   . Define       𝔢  =   𝔥  ×  𝔤    ,      𝔢    𝔥  𝔤     \mathfrak{e}=\mathfrak{h}\times\mathfrak{g},   and define addition pointwise on   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   . Scalar multiplication is defined by         α   (  H  ,  G  )    =   (   α  G   ,   α  G   )    ,    α  ∈  F   ,    H  ∈  𝔥   ,   G  ∈  𝔤      .     formulae-sequence      α   H  G       α  G     α  G      formulae-sequence    α  F    formulae-sequence    H  𝔥     G  𝔤       \alpha(H,G)=(\alpha G,\alpha G),\alpha\in F,H\in\mathfrak{h},G\in\mathfrak{g}.

It is, of course, nothing else than the Lie algebra direct sum. By symmetry of definitions,   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is an extension of   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   by   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   as well, but    𝐡  ⊕  𝐠  ≠  𝐠  ⊕  𝐡      𝐡  normal-⊕  𝐠  normal-≠  𝐠  normal-⊕  𝐡    \mathbf{h}⊕\mathbf{g}≠\mathbf{g}⊕\mathbf{h}   . It is clear from  that the subalgebra    0  ⊕  𝐠      0  normal-⊕  𝐠    0⊕\mathbf{g}   is an ideal (Lie algebra) . This property of the direct sum of Lie algebras is promoted to the definition of a trivial extension.  By semidirect sum  Inspired by the construction of a semidirect product ( background ) of groups using a homomorphism    G  →  A  u  t   (  H  )       G  normal-→  A  u  t  H    G→Aut(H)   , one can make the corresponding construct for Lie algebras.  If    ψ  :   𝐠  →  d  e  r  𝐡      normal-:  ψ    𝐠  normal-→  d  e  r  𝐡     ψ:\mathbf{g}→der\mathbf{h}   is a Lie algebra homomorphism, then define a Lie bracket on    𝐞  =   𝐡  ⊕  𝐠       𝐞    𝐡  normal-⊕  𝐠     \mathbf{e}=\mathbf{h}⊕\mathbf{g}   by  With this Lie bracket, the Lie algebra so obtained is denoted  h ⊕ S  g }} and is called the semidirect sum of   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   and   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   .  By inspection of  one sees that    0  ⊕  𝐠      0  normal-⊕  𝐠    0⊕\mathbf{g}   is a subalgebra of   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   and    𝐡  ⊕  0      𝐡  normal-⊕  0    \mathbf{h}⊕0   is an ideal in   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   . Define    i  :   𝐡  →  𝐞      normal-:  i    𝐡  normal-→  𝐞     i:\mathbf{h}→\mathbf{e}   by    H  ↦  H  ⊕  0      H  normal-↦  H  normal-⊕  0    H↦H⊕0   and    s  :   𝐞  →  𝐠      normal-:  s    𝐞  normal-→  𝐠     s:\mathbf{e}→\mathbf{g}   by     H  ⊕  G  ↦  G   ,   H  ∈  𝐡   ,   G  ∈  𝐠        H  normal-⊕  G  normal-↦  G     H  normal-∈  𝐡     G  normal-∈  𝐠     H⊕G↦G,H∈\mathbf{h},G∈\mathbf{g}   . It is clear that     k  e  r  s   =   i  m  i         k  e  r  s     i  m  i     kers=imi   . Thus   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is a Lie algebra extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   .  As with the trivial extension, this property generalizes to the definition of a split extension.  Example Let   G   G   G   be the Lorentz group     O   (  3  ,  1  )       O   3  1     O(3,1)   and let   T   T   T   denote the translation group in 4 dimensions, isomorphic to , and consider the multiplication rule of the Poincaré group    P   P   P              (   a  2   ,   Λ  2   )    (   a  1   ,   Λ  1   )    =    (    a  2   +    Λ  2    a  1     ,    Λ  2    Λ  1    )   ,   a  1     ,    a  2   ∈  T  ⊂  P    ,     Λ  1   ,   Λ  2    ∈   O   (  3  ,  1  )    ⊂  P    ,     formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence        subscript  a  2    subscript  normal-Λ  2      subscript  a  1    subscript  normal-Λ  1          subscript  a  2      subscript  normal-Λ  2    subscript  a  1        subscript  normal-Λ  2    subscript  normal-Λ  1      subscript  a  1          subscript  a  2   normal-T       P           subscript  normal-Λ  1    subscript  normal-Λ  2      normal-O   3  1         normal-P      (a_{2},\Lambda_{2})(a_{1},\Lambda_{1})=(a_{2}+\Lambda_{2}a_{1},\Lambda_{2}%

From it follows immediately that, in the Poincaré group, (Λ a , I ) ∈ T ⊂ P}} . Thus every Lorentz transformation   Λ   normal-Λ   Λ   corresponds to an automorphism of   T   T   T   with inverse and   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   is clearly a homomorphism. Now define        P  ¯   =    T   ⊗  S   O    (  3  ,  1  )     ,       normal-¯  normal-P       subscript  tensor-product  S   normal-T  normal-O    3  1      \overline{\mathrm{P}}=\mathrm{T}\otimes_{S}\mathrm{O}(3,1),   endowed with multiplication given by . Unwinding the definitions one finds that the multiplication is the same as the multiplication one started with and it follows that     P  ¯   =  P       normal-¯  P   P    \overline{P}=P   . From  follows that Ad Λ }} and then from  it follows that ad λ . λ ∈ o (3, 1)}} .  By derivation  Let   δ   δ   δ   be a derivation ( background ) of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   and denote by   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   the one-dimensional Lie algebra spanned by   δ   δ   δ   . Define the Lie bracket on    𝐞  =   𝐡  ⊗  𝐠       𝐞    𝐡  normal-⊗  𝐠     \mathbf{e}=\mathbf{h}⊗\mathbf{g}   by 14        [    H  1   +   G  1    ,    H  2   +   G  2    ]   =     [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   +   δ   (   G  1   )     -   δ   (   G  2   )      .          subscript  H  1    subscript  G  1       subscript  H  2    subscript  G  2           subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2      δ   subscript  G  1       δ   subscript  G  2       [H_{1}+G_{1},H_{2}+G_{2}]=[G_{1},G_{2}]+\delta(G_{1})-\delta(G_{2}).   It is obvious from the definition of the bracket that   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is and ideal in   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   in and that   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   is a subalgebra of   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   . Furthermore,   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   is complementary to   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   in   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   . Let    i  :   𝐡  →  𝐞      normal-:  i    𝐡  normal-→  𝐞     i:\mathbf{h}→\mathbf{e}   be given by    H  ↦   (  H  ,  0  )       H  normal-↦   H  0     H↦(H,0)   and    s  :   𝐞  →  𝐠      normal-:  s    𝐞  normal-→  𝐠     s:\mathbf{e}→\mathbf{g}   by     (  H  ,  G  )   ↦  G       H  G   normal-↦  G    (H,G)↦G   . It is clear that     i  m  i   =   k  e  r  s         i  m  i     k  e  r  s     imi=kers   . Thus   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is a split extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   . Such an extension is called extension by a derivation .  By 2-cocycle  If   ε   ε   ε   is a 2-cocycle ( background ) on a Lie algebra   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   and   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   is any one-dimensional vectors space, let    𝐞  =   𝐡  ⊕  𝐠       𝐞    𝐡  normal-⊕  𝐠     \mathbf{e}=\mathbf{h}⊕\mathbf{g}   (vector space direct sum) and define a Lie bracket on   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   by         [    μ  H   +   G  1    ,    ν  H   +   G  2    ]   =     [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   +   ϵ   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )   H    ,  μ    ,   ν  ∈  F    .     formulae-sequence         μ  H    subscript  G  1        ν  H    subscript  G  2          subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2      ϵ     G  1     G  2    H    μ      ν  F     [\mu H+G_{1},\nu H+G_{2}]=[G_{1},G_{2}]+\epsilon(G1,G2)H,\quad\mu,\nu\in F.     Here   H   H   H   is an arbitrary but fixed element of   𝐡   𝐡   \mathbf{h}   . Antisymmetry follows from antisymmetry of the Lie bracket on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   and antisymmetry of the 2-cocycle. The Jacobi identity follows from the corresponding properties of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   and of   ε   ε   ε   . Thus   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is a Lie algebra. Put 0}} and it follows that    μ  H  ∈  Z   (  𝐞  )       μ  H  normal-∈  Z  𝐞    μH∈Z(\mathbf{e})   . Also, it follows with    i  :   μ  H  ↦   (   μ  H   ,  0  )       normal-:  i    μ  H  normal-↦     μ  H   0      i:μH↦(μH,0)   and    s  :    (   μ  H   ,  G  )   ↦  G      normal-:  s       μ  H   G   normal-↦  G     s:(μH,G)↦G   that . Hence   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is a central extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   by   h   h   h   . It is called extension by a 2-cocycle .  Theorems  Below follows some results regarding central extensions and 2-cocycles. 15  Theorem 16 Let and be cohomologous 2-cocycles on a Lie algebra   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   and let and be respectively the central extensions constructed with these 2-cocycles. Then the central extensions and are equivalent extensions.  Proof By definition,  φ 1 + δf }} . Define       ψ  :    G  +   μ  c    ∈   𝔢  1   ↦   G  +   μ  c   +   f   (  G  )   c    ∈   𝔢  2     .     normal-:  ψ        G    μ  c     subscript  𝔢  1     maps-to      G    μ  c     f  G  c          subscript  𝔢  2       \psi:G+\mu c\in\mathfrak{e}_{1}\mapsto G+\mu c+f(G)c\in\mathfrak{e}_{2}.   It follows from the definitions that   ψ   ψ   ψ   is a Lie algebra isomorphism and  holds.  Corollary A cohomology class defines a central extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   which is unique up to isomorphism.  The trivial 2-cocycle gives the trivial extension, and since a 2-coboundary is cohomologous with the trivial 2-cocycle, one has  Corollary A central extension defined by a coboundary is equivalent with a trivial central extension.  Theorem A finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra has only trivial central extensions.  Proof Since every central extension comes from a 2-cocycle   φ   φ   φ   , it suffices to show that every 2-cocycle is a coboundary. Suppose   φ   φ   φ   is a 2-cocycle on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . The task is to use this 2-cocycle to manufacture a 1-cochain   f   f   f   such that    φ  =   δ  f       φ    δ  f     φ=δf   .  The first step is to for each use   φ   φ   φ   to define a linear map . But the linear maps are elements of . This suffices to express   φ   φ   φ   in terms of   K   K   K   , using the isomorphism   ν   ν   ν   . Next, a linear map    d  :   𝐠  →  𝐠      normal-:  d    𝐠  normal-→  𝐠     d:\mathbf{g}→\mathbf{g}   is defined that turns out to be a derivation. Since all derivations are inner, one has ad G d }} for some . An expression for   φ   φ   φ   in terms of   K   K   K   and   d   d   d   is obtained. Thus set, trusting that   d   d   d   is a derivation,        φ   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )    ≡    ρ   G  1     (   G  2   )    =   K   (    ν   -  1     (   ρ   G  1    )    ,   G  2   )    ≡   K   (   d   (   G  1   )    ,   G  2   )    =   K   (    ad   G  d     (   G  1   )    ,   G  2   )    =   K   (   [   G  d   ,   G  1   ]   ,   G  2   )    =   K   (   G  d   ,   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   )     .          φ    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2        subscript  ρ   subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2           K      superscript  ν    1     subscript  ρ   subscript  G  1      subscript  G  2            K     d   subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2            K      subscript  ad   subscript  G  d     subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2            K     subscript  G  d    subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2            K    subscript  G  d     subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2         \varphi(G_{1},G_{2})\equiv\rho_{G_{1}}(G_{2})=K(\nu^{-1}(\rho_{G_{1}}),G_{2})%

 {2}),   showing that   φ   φ   φ   is a coboundary. By the previous results, any central extension is trivial.  To verify that   d   d   d   actually is a derivation, first note that it is linear since   ν   ν   ν   is, then compute      K   (  d   (   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   )   ,   G  3   )   )     fragments  K   fragments  normal-(  d   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-[   subscript  G  1   normal-,   subscript  G  2   normal-]   normal-)   normal-,   subscript  G  3   normal-)   normal-)    \displaystyle K(d([G_{1},G_{2}]),G_{3}))   By appeal to the non-degeneracy of   K   K   K   , the left arguments of   K   K   K   are equal on the far left and far right.  The observation that one can define a derivation   d   d   d   , given a symmetric non-degenerate associative form   K   K   K   and a 2-cocycle   φ   φ   φ   , by        K   (    ν   -  1     (   ρ   G  1    )    ,   G  2   )    ≡   K   (   d   (   G  1   )    ,   G  2   )     ,        K      superscript  ν    1     subscript  ρ   subscript  G  1      subscript  G  2       K     d   subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2       K(\nu^{-1}(\rho_{G_{1}}),G_{2})\equiv K(d(G_{1}),G_{2}),   or using the symmetry of   K   K   K   and the antisymmetry of   φ   φ   φ   ,        K   (   d   (   G  1   )    ,   G  2   )    =   -   K   (   G  1   ,   d   (   G  2   )    )      ,        K     d   subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2         K    subscript  G  1     d   subscript  G  2         K(d(G_{1}),G_{2})=-K(G_{1},d(G_{2})),   leads to a corollary.  Corollary Let    𝐠  :   →  𝐅      normal-:  𝐠    normal-→  𝐅     \mathbf{g:→F}   be a non-degenerate symmetric associative bilinear form and let   d   d   d   be a derivation satisfying        L   (   d   (   G  1   )    ,   G  2   )    =   -   L   (   G  1   ,   d   (   G  2   )    )      ,        L     d   subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2         L    subscript  G  1     d   subscript  G  2         L(d(G_{1}),G_{2})=-L(G_{1},d(G_{2})),   then   φ   φ   φ   defined by       φ   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )    =   L   (   d   (   G  1   )    ,   G  2   )          φ    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2       L     d   subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2       \varphi(G_{1},G_{2})=L(d(G_{1}),G_{2})   is a 2-cocycle.  Proof The condition on   d   d   d   ensures the antisymmetry of   φ   φ   φ   . The Jacobi identity for 2-cocycles follows starting with        φ   (   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   ,   G  3   )    =   L   (   d   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]    ,   G  3   )    =    L   (   [   d   (   G  1   )    ,   G  2   ]   ,   G  3   )    +   L   (   [   G  1   ,   d   (   G  2   )    ]   ,   G  3   )      ,          φ      G  1    subscript  G  2     subscript  G  3       L     d     G  1    subscript  G  2      subscript  G  3              L      d    G  1     subscript  G  2     subscript  G  3       L      G  1     d   subscript  G  2      subscript  G  3         \varphi([G1,G_{2}],G_{3})=L(d[G1,G_{2}],G_{3})=L([d(G1),G_{2}],G_{3})+L([G1,d(%
 G_{2})],G_{3}),   using symmetry of the form, the antisymmetry of the bracket, and once again the definition of   φ   φ   φ   in terms of   L   L   L   .  If   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is the Lie algebra of a Lie group   G   G   G   and   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is a central extension of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   , one may ask whether there is a Lie group   E   E   E   with Lie algebra   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   . The answer is, by Lie's third theorem affirmative. But is there a central extension    E   E   E   of   G   G   G   with Lie algebra   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   ? The answer to this question requires some machinery, and can be found in .  Applications  The "negative" result of the preceding theorem indicates that one must, at least for semisimple Lie algebras, go to infinite-dimensional Lie algebras to find useful applications of central extensions. There are indeed such. Here will be presented affine Kac–Moody algebras and Virasoro algebras. These are extensions of polynomial loop-algebras and the Witt algebra respectively.  Polynomial loop-algebra  Let   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   be a polynomial loop algebra ( background ),       𝔤  =    C   [  λ  ,   λ   -  1    ]    ⊗   𝔤  0     ,      𝔤   tensor-product    C   λ   superscript  λ    1       subscript  𝔤  0      \mathfrak{g}=C[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]\otimes\mathfrak{g}_{0},   where is a complex finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. The goal is to find a central extension of this algebra. Two of the theorems apply. On the one hand, if there is a 2-cocycle on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   , then a central extension may be defined. On the other hand, if this 2-cocycle is acting on the part (only), then the resulting extension is trivial. Moreover, derivations acting on (only) cannot be used for definition of a 2-cocycle either because these derivations are all inner and the same problem results. One therefore looks for derivations on . One such set of derivations is         d  k   ≡    λ   k  +  1     d   d  k      ,   k  ∈  ℤ    .     formulae-sequence     subscript  d  k      superscript  λ    k  1      d    d  k        k  ℤ     d_{k}\equiv\lambda^{k+1}\frac{d}{dk},\quad k\in\mathbb{Z}.     In order to manufacture a non-degenerate bilinear associative antisymmetric form   L   L   L   on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   , attention is focused first on restrictions on the arguments, with    m  ,  n     m  n    m,n   fixed. It is a theorem that every form satisfying the requirements is a multiple of the Killing form   K   K   K   on . 17 This requires        L   (    λ  l   ⊗   G  1    ,    λ  m   ⊗   G  2    )    =    γ   l  m    K   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )     .        L    tensor-product   superscript  λ  l    subscript  G  1     tensor-product   superscript  λ  m    subscript  G  2         subscript  γ    l  m    K    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2       L(\lambda^{l}\otimes G_{1},\lambda^{m}\otimes G_{2})=\gamma_{lm}K(G_{1},G_{2}).   Symmetry of   K   K   K   implies        γ   m  n    =   γ   n  m     ,       subscript  γ    m  n     subscript  γ    n  m      \gamma_{mn}=\gamma_{nm},   and associativity yields        γ    k  +  l   ,  m    =   γ   k  ,   l  +  m      .       subscript  γ     k  l   m     subscript  γ   k    l  m       \gamma_{k+l,m}=\gamma_{k,l+m}.   With    l  =  0      l  0    l=0   one sees that  γ 0, l + m }} . This last condition implies the former. Using this fact, define  γ 0, n }} . The defining equation then becomes        L   (    λ  m   ⊗   G  1    ,    λ  m   ⊗   G  2    )    =   f   (   l  +  m   )   K   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )     .

For every    i  ∈  ℤ      i  normal-∈  normal-ℤ    i∈ℤ   the definition        f   (  n  )    =   δ   n  i     ⇔    γ   l  m    =   δ    l  +  m   ,  i        normal-⇔      f  n    subscript  δ    n  i        subscript  γ    l  m     subscript  δ     l  m   i       f(n)=\delta_{ni}\Leftrightarrow\gamma_{lm}=\delta_{l+m,i}   does define a symmetric associative bilinear form         L  i    (    λ  l   ⊗   G  1    ,    λ  m   ⊗   G  2    )    =    δ    l  +  m   ,  i    K   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )     .         subscript  L  i     tensor-product   superscript  λ  l    subscript  G  1     tensor-product   superscript  λ  m    subscript  G  2         subscript  δ     l  m   i    K    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2       L_{i}(\lambda^{l}\otimes G_{1},\lambda^{m}\otimes G_{2})=\delta_{l+m,i}K(G_{1}%

An additional dimension, an extension by a derivation is required for this. Nonetheless, if, in a physical application, the eigenvalues of or its representative are interpreted as (ordinary) quantum numbers , the additional superscript on the generators is referred to as the level . It is an additional quantum number. An additional operator whose eigenvalues are precisely the levels is introduced further below.  Current algebra  As an application of a central extension of polynomial loop algebra, a current algebra of a quantum field theory is considered ( background ). Suppose one has a current algebra, with the interesting commutator being ^cJ_c^i(t, \mathbf x)\delta(\mathbf x - \mathbf y) + S_{ab}^{ij}\partial_j\delta(\mathbf x - \mathbf y) + ... ,| CA10 }} with a Schwinger term.

By comparison with , this is a current algebra in two spacetime dimensions, including a Schwinger term , with the space dimension curled up into a circle. In the classical setting of quantum field theory, this is perhaps of little use, but with the advent of string theory where fields live on world sheets of strings, and spatial dimensions are curled up, there may be relevant applications.  Kac–Moody algebra  The derivation used in the construction of the 2-cocycle   φ   φ   φ   in the previous section can be extended to a derivation   D   D   D   on the centrally extended polynomial loop algebra, here denoted by   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   in order to realize a Kac–Moody algebra 20 21 ( background ). Simply set      D   (  P   (  λ  )   ⊗  G  +  μ  C  )   =  λ    d  P   (  λ  )     d  λ    ⊗  G  )  .     fragments  D   fragments  normal-(  P   fragments  normal-(  λ  normal-)   tensor-product  G   μ  C  normal-)    λ      d  P  λ     d  λ    tensor-product  G  normal-)  normal-.    D(P(\lambda)\otimes G+\mu C)=\lambda\frac{dP(\lambda)}{d\lambda}\otimes G).   Next, define as a vector space       𝔢  =    ℂ  d   +  𝔤    .      𝔢      ℂ  d   𝔤     \mathfrak{e}=\mathbb{C}d+\mathfrak{g}.   The Lie bracket on   𝐞   𝐞   \mathbf{e}   is, according to the standard construction with a derivation, given on a basis by      [     λ  m   ⊗   G  1    +   μ  C   +   ν  D    ,     λ  n   ⊗   G  2    +    μ  ′   C   +    ν  ′   D    ]        tensor-product   superscript  λ  m    subscript  G  1      μ  C     ν  D       tensor-product   superscript  λ  n    subscript  G  2       superscript  μ  normal-′   C      superscript  ν  normal-′   D      \displaystyle{}[\lambda^{m}\otimes G_{1}+\mu C+\nu D,\lambda^{n}\otimes G_{2}+%
 \mu^{\prime}C+\nu^{\prime}D]     For convenience, define        G  i  m   ↔    λ  m   ⊗   G  i     .     normal-↔   superscript   subscript  G  i   m    tensor-product   superscript  λ  m    subscript  G  i      G_{i}^{m}\leftrightarrow\lambda^{m}\otimes G_{i}.   In addition, assume the basis on the underlying finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra has been chosen so that the structure coefficients are antisymmetric in all indices and that the basis is appropriately normalized. Then one immediately through the definitions verifies the following commutation relations.      [   G  i  m   ,   G  j  n   ]      superscript   subscript  G  i   m    superscript   subscript  G  j   n     \displaystyle{}[G_{i}^{m},G_{j}^{n}]   These are precisely the short-hand description of an untwisted affine Kac–Moody algebra. To recapitulate, begin with a finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. Define a space of formal Laurent polynomials with coefficients in the finite-dimensional simple Lie algebra. Withe the support of a symmetric non-degenerate alternating bilinear form and a derivation, a 2-cocycle is defined, subsequently used in the standard prescription for a central extension by a 2-cocycle. Extend the derivation to this new space, use the standard prescription for a split extension by a derivation and an untwisted affine Kac–Moody algebra obtains.  Virasoro algebra  The purpose is to construct the Virasoro algebra , due to Miguel Angel Virasoro , 22 as a central extension by a 2-cocycle   φ   φ   φ   of the Witt algebra   W   W   W   ( background ). The Jacobi identity for 2-cocycles yields  Letting    l  =  0      l  0    l=0   and using antisymmetry of   η   η   η   one obtains         (   m  +  p   )    η   m  p     =    (   m  -  p   )    η    m  +  p   ,  0      .          m  p    subscript  η    m  p         m  p    subscript  η     m  p   0       (m+p)\eta_{mp}=(m-p)\eta_{m+p,0}.     In the extension, the commutation relations for the element are         [    d  0   +   μ  C    ,    d  m   +   ν  C    ]   φ   =    -   m   d  m     +    η   0  m    C    =   -   m   (    d  m   -     η   0  m    m   C    )      .         subscript      subscript  d  0     μ  C       subscript  d  m     ν  C     φ         m   subscript  d  m        subscript  η    0  m    C             m     subscript  d  m        subscript  η    0  m    m   C         [d_{0}+\mu C,d_{m}+\nu C]_{\varphi}=-md_{m}+\eta_{0m}C=-m(d_{m}-\frac{\eta_{0m%
 }}{m}C).   It is desirable to get rid of the central charge on the right hand side. To do this define       f  :    W  →  ℂ   ;    d  m   →    φ   (   d  0   ,   d  m   )    m   =    η   0  m    m      .     normal-:  f   formulae-sequence   normal-→  W  ℂ      normal-→   subscript  d  m       φ    subscript  d  0    subscript  d  m     m           subscript  η    0  m    m        f:W\to\mathbb{C};d_{m}\to\frac{\varphi(d_{0},d_{m})}{m}=\frac{\eta_{0m}}{m}.   Then, using   f   f   f   as a 1-cochain,        η   0  n   ′   =    φ  ′    (   d  0   ,   d  n   )    =    φ   (   d  0   ,   d  n   )    +   δ  f   (   [   d  0   ,   d  n   ]   )     =    φ   (   d  0   ,   d  n   )    -   n    η   0  n    n     =  0   ,         subscript   superscript  η  normal-′     0  n       superscript  φ  normal-′     subscript  d  0    subscript  d  n              φ    subscript  d  0    subscript  d  n       δ  f    subscript  d  0    subscript  d  n               φ    subscript  d  0    subscript  d  n       n     superscript  η    0  n    n          0     \eta^{\prime}_{0n}=\varphi^{\prime}(d_{0},d_{n})=\varphi(d_{0},d_{n})+\delta f%
 ([d_{0},d_{n}])=\varphi(d_{0},d_{n})-n\frac{\eta^{0n}}{n}=0,   so with this 2-cocycle, equivalent to the previous one, one has 23         [    d  0   +   μ  C    ,    d  m   +   ν  C    ]    φ  ′    =   -   m   d  m      .       subscript      subscript  d  0     μ  C       subscript  d  m     ν  C      superscript  φ  normal-′        m   subscript  d  m       [d_{0}+\mu C,d_{m}+\nu C]_{\varphi^{\prime}}=-md_{m}.   With this new 2-cocycle (skip the prime) the condition becomes         (   n  +  p   )    η   m  p     =    (   n  -  p   )    η    m  +  p   ,  0     =  0   ,            n  p    subscript  η    m  p         n  p    subscript  η     m  p   0          0     (n+p)\eta_{mp}=(n-p)\eta_{m+p,0}=0,   and thus         η   m  p    =   a   (  m  )    δ   m  .   -  p       ,    a   (   -  m   )    =   -   a   (  m  )       ,     formulae-sequence     subscript  η    m  p      a  m   subscript  δ   formulae-sequence  m    p           a    m        a  m       \eta_{mp}=a(m)\delta_{m.-p},\quad a(-m)=-a(m),   where the last condition is due to the antisymmetry of the Lie bracket. With this, and with     l  +  m  +  p   =  0        l  m  p   0    l+m+p=0   (cutting out a "plane" in ),  yields          (    2  m   +  p   )   a   (  p  )    +    (   m  -  p   )   a   (   m  +  p   )    +    (   m  +   2  p    )   a   (  m  )     =  0   ,              2  m   p   a  p       m  p   a    m  p        m    2  p    a  m    0    (2m+p)a(p)+(m-p)a(m+p)+(m+2p)a(m)=0,     that with    p  =  1      p  1    p=1   (cutting out a "line" in ) becomes          (   m  -  1   )   a   (   m  +  1   )    -    (   m  +  2   )   a   (  m  )     +    (    2  m   +  1   )   a   (  1  )     =  0.              m  1   a    m  1        m  2   a  m          2  m   1   a  1    0.    (m-1)a(m+1)-(m+2)a(m)+(2m+1)a(1)=0.   This is a difference equation generally solved by        a   (  m  )    =    α  m   +   β   m  3      .        a  m       α  m     β   superscript  m  3       a(m)=\alpha m+\beta m^{3}.   The commutator in the extension on elements of   W   W   W   is then        [   d  l   ,   d  m   ]   =     (   l  -  m   )    d   l  +  m     +    (    α  m   +   β   m  3     )    δ   l  ,   -  m     C     .        subscript  d  l    subscript  d  m          l  m    subscript  d    l  m           α  m     β   superscript  m  3      subscript  δ   l    m     C      [d_{l},d_{m}]=(l-m)d_{l+m}+(\alpha m+\beta m^{3})\delta_{l,-m}C.   With   β   β   β   it is possible to change basis (or modify the 2-cocycle by a 2-coboundary) so that        [   d  l  ′   ,   d  m  ′   ]   =    (   l  -  m   )    d   l  +  m      ,        subscript   superscript  d  normal-′   l    subscript   superscript  d  normal-′   m        l  m    subscript  d    l  m       [d^{\prime}_{l},d^{\prime}_{m}]=(l-m)d_{l+m},   with the central charge absent altogether, and the extension is hence trivial. (This was not (generally) the case with the previous modification, where only obtained the original relations.)

It also shows that is one-dimensional (corresponding to the choice of   β   β   β   ) The conventional choice is to take    α  =   −  β   =   1  /  12         α    normal-−  β          1  12      α=−β={1}/{12}   and still retaining freedom by absorbing an arbitrary factor in the arbitrary object   C   C   C   . The Virasoro algebra    V   V   V   is then       𝒱  =   𝒲  +   ℂ  C     ,      𝒱    𝒲    ℂ  C      \mathcal{V}=\mathcal{W}+\mathbb{C}C,   with commutation relations        [    d  l   +   μ  C    ,    d  m   +   ν  C    ]   =     (   l  -  m   )    d   l  +  m     +     (   m  -   m  3    )   12    δ   l  ,   -  m     C     .          subscript  d  l     μ  C       subscript  d  m     ν  C           l  m    subscript  d    l  m           m   superscript  m  3    12    subscript  δ   l    m     C      [d_{l}+\mu C,d_{m}+\nu C]=(l-m)d_{l+m}+\frac{(m-m^{3})}{12}\delta_{l,-m}C.     Bosonic open strings  The relativistic classical open string ( background ) is subject to quantization . This roughly amounts to taking the position and the momentum of the string and promoting them to operators on the space of states of open strings. Since strings are extended objects, this results in a continuum of operators depending on the parameter   σ   σ   σ   . The following commutation relations are postulated in the Heisenberg picture . 24      [    X  I    (  τ  ,  σ  )    ,    𝒫   τ  J     (  τ  ,  σ  )    ]        superscript  X  I    τ  σ       superscript  𝒫    τ  J     τ  σ      \displaystyle{}[X^{I}(\tau,\sigma),\mathcal{P}^{\tau J}(\tau,\sigma)]   All other commutators vanish.  Because of the continuum of operators, and because of the delta functions, it is desirable to express these relations instead in terms of the quantized versions of the Virasoro modes, the Virasoro operators . These are calculated to satisfy       [   α  m  I   ,   α  n  J   ]   =   m   η   I  J     δ    m  +  n   ,  0           superscript   subscript  α  m   I    superscript   subscript  α  n   J      m   superscript  η    I  J     subscript  δ     m  n   0       [\alpha_{m}^{I},\alpha_{n}^{J}]=m\eta^{IJ}\delta_{m+n,0}   They are interpreted as creation and annihilation operators acting on Hilbert space, increasing or decreasing the quantum of their respective modes. If the index is negative, the operator is a creation operator, otherwise it is an annihilation operator. (If it is zero, it is proportional to the total momentum operator.) In view of the fact that the light cone plus and minus modes were expressed in terms of the transverse Virasoro modes, one must consider the commutation relations between the Virasoro operators. These were classically defined (then modes) as        L  n   =    1  2     ∑   p  ∈  ℤ      α   n  -  p   I    α  p  I       .       subscript  L  n       1  2     subscript     p  ℤ       superscript   subscript  α    n  p    I    superscript   subscript  α  p   I        L_{n}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{p\in\mathbb{Z}}\alpha_{n-p}^{I}\alpha_{p}^{I}.     Since, in the quantized theory, the alphas are operators, the ordering of the factors matter. In view of the commutation relation between the mode operators, it will only matter for the operator (for which     m  +  n   =  0        m  n   0    m+n=0   ). is chosen normal ordered ,       L  0   =   1  2    α  0  I    α  0  I   +   ∑   p  =  1   ∞    α   -  p   I    α  p  I   ,  =   α  ′    p  I    p  I   +   ∑   p  =  1   ∞   p   α  p   I  †     α  p  I   +  c     fragments   subscript  L  0      1  2    superscript   subscript  α  0   I    superscript   subscript  α  0   I     superscript   subscript     p  1       superscript   subscript  α    p    I    superscript   subscript  α  p   I   normal-,    superscript  α  normal-′    superscript  p  I    superscript  p  I     superscript   subscript     p  1      p   superscript   subscript  α  p    I  normal-†     superscript   subscript  α  p   I    c    L_{0}=\frac{1}{2}\alpha_{0}^{I}\alpha_{0}^{I}+\sum_{p=1}^{\infty}\alpha_{-p}^{%

 \dagger}\alpha_{p}^{I}+c   where   c   c   c   is a possible ordering constant. One obtains after a somewhat lengthy calculation 25 the relations        [   L  m   ,   L  n   ]   =    (   m  -  n   )    L   m  +  n      ,    m  +  n   ≠  0.      formulae-sequence      subscript  L  m    subscript  L  n        m  n    subscript  L    m  n          m  n   0.     [L_{m},L_{n}]=(m-n)L_{m+n},\quad m+n\neq 0.   If one would allow for     m  +  n   =  0        m  n   0    m+n=0   above, then one has precisely the commutation relations of the Witt algebra. Instead one has         [   L  m   ,   L  n   ]   =      (   m  -  n   )    L   m  +  n     +     D  -  2   12    (    m  3   -  m   )    δ    m  +  n   ,  0      ,   ∀  m     ,   n  ∈  ℤ    .     formulae-sequence      subscript  L  m    subscript  L  n           m  n    subscript  L    m  n           D  2   12      superscript  m  3   m    subscript  δ     m  n   0       for-all  m       n  ℤ     [L_{m},L_{n}]=(m-n)L_{m+n}+\frac{D-2}{12}(m^{3}-m)\delta_{m+n,0},\quad\forall m%
 ,n\in\mathbb{Z}.   upon identification of the generic central term as    (   D  −  2   )      D  normal-−  2    (D−2)   times the identity operator, this is the Virasoro algebra, the universal central extension of the Witt algebra.  The operator enters the theory as the Hamiltonian , modulo an additive constant. Moreover, the Virasoro operators enter into the definition of the Lorentz generators of the theory. It is perhaps the most important algebra in string theory. 26 The consistency of the Lorentz generators, by the way, fixes the spacetime dimensionality to 26. While this theory presented here (for relative simplicity of exposition) is unphysical, or at the very least incomplete (it has, for instance, no fermions) the Virasoro algebra arises in the same way in the more viable superstring theory and M-theory .  Group extension  A projective representation    Π   (  G  )       normal-Π  G    Π(G)   of a Lie group   G   G   G   ( background ) can be used to define a so-called group extension  .  In quantum mechanics, Wigner's theorem asserts that if   G   G   G   is a symmetry group, then it will be represented projectively on Hilbert space by unitary or antiunitary operators. This is often dealt with by passing to the universal covering group of   G   G   G   and take it as the symmetry group. This works nicely for the rotation group     S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   and the Lorentz group     O   (  3  ,  1  )       O   3  1     O(3,1)   , but it does not work when the symmetry group is the Galilean group . In this case one has to pass to its central extension, the Bargmann group , 27 which is the symmetry group of the Schrödinger equation . Likewise, if ℝ 2 n }} , the group of translations in position and momentum space, one has to pass to its central extension, the Heisenberg group . 28  Let   ω   ω   ω   be the 2-cocycle on   G   G   G   induced by   Π   normal-Π   Π   . Define 29       G  ex   =    ℂ  *   ×  G   =   {   (  λ  ,  g  )   |    λ  ∈  ℂ   ,   g  ∈  G    }          subscript  G  ex      superscript  ℂ    G         conditional-set   λ  g    formulae-sequence    λ  ℂ     g  G        G_{\mathrm{ex}}=\mathbb{C}^{*}\times G=\{(\lambda,g)|\lambda\in\mathbb{C},g\in
 G\}   as a set and let the multiplication be defined by         (   λ  1   ,   g  1   )    (   λ  2   ,   g  2   )    =   (    λ  1    λ  2   ω   (   g  1   ,   g  2   )    ,    g  1    g  2    )    .          subscript  λ  1    subscript  g  1      subscript  λ  2    subscript  g  2         subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2   ω    subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2        subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2       (\lambda_{1},g_{1})(\lambda_{2},g_{2})=(\lambda_{1}\lambda_{2}\omega(g_{1},g_{%
 2}),g_{1}g_{2}).   Associativity holds since   ω   ω   ω   is a 2-cocycle on   G   G   G   . One has for the unit element         (  1  ,  e  )    (  λ  ,  g  )    =   (   λ  ω   (  e  ,  g  )    ,  g  )   =   (  λ  ,  g  )   =    (  λ  ,  g  )    (  1  ,  e  )     ,           1  e    λ  g       λ  ω   e  g    g         λ  g           λ  g    1  e       (1,e)(\lambda,g)=(\lambda\omega(e,g),g)=(\lambda,g)=(\lambda,g)(1,e),   and for the inverse         (  λ  ,  g  )    -  1    =   (   1   λ  ω   (  g  ,   g   -  1    )     ,   g   -  1    )    .       superscript   λ  g     1       1    λ  ω   g   superscript  g    1        superscript  g    1       (\lambda,g)^{-1}=\left(\frac{1}{\lambda\omega(g,g^{-1})},g^{-1}\right).     The set is an abelian subgroup of . This means that is not semisimple. The center of   G   G   G   ,  includes this subgroup. The center may be larger.  At the level of Lie algebras it can be shown that the Lie algebra of is given by        𝔤  ex   =    ℂ  C   ⊕  𝔤    ,       subscript  𝔤  ex    direct-sum    ℂ  C   𝔤     \mathfrak{g}_{\mathrm{ex}}=\mathbb{C}C\oplus\mathfrak{g},   as a vector space and endowed with the Lie bracket        [    μ  C   +   G  1    ,    ν  C   +   G  2    ]   =    [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   +   η   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )   C     .           μ  C    subscript  G  1        ν  C    subscript  G  2         subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2      η    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2    C      [\mu C+G_{1},\nu C+G_{2}]=[G_{1},G_{2}]+\eta(G_{1},G_{2})C.   Here   η   η   η   is a 2-cocycle on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . This 2-cocycle can be obtained from   ω   ω   ω   albeit in a highly nontrivial way. 30  Now by using the projective representation   Π   normal-Π   Π   one may define a map by         Π  ex    (   (  λ  ,  g  )   )    =   λ  Π   (  g  )     .         subscript  normal-Π  ex    λ  g      λ  normal-Π  g     \Pi_{\mathrm{ex}}((\lambda,g))=\lambda\Pi(g).   It has the properties         Π  ex    (   (   λ  1   ,   g  1   )   )    Π  ex    (   (   λ  2   ,   g  2   )   )    =    λ  1    λ  2   Π   (   g  1   )   Π   (   g  2   )    =    λ  1    λ  2   ω   (   g  1   ,   g  2   )   Π   (    g  1    g  2    )    =    Π  ex    (    λ  1    λ  2   ω   (   g  1   ,   g  2   )    ,    g  1    g  2    )    =    Π  ex    (    (   λ  1   ,   g  1   )    (   λ  2   ,   g  2   )    )     ,           subscript  normal-Π  ex     subscript  λ  1    subscript  g  1     subscript  normal-Π  ex     subscript  λ  2    subscript  g  2        subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2   normal-Π   subscript  g  1   normal-Π   subscript  g  2            subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2   ω    subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2    normal-Π     subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2             subscript  normal-Π  ex       subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2   ω    subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2        subscript  g  1    subscript  g  2              subscript  normal-Π  ex       subscript  λ  1    subscript  g  1      subscript  λ  2    subscript  g  2         \Pi_{\mathrm{ex}}((\lambda_{1},g_{1}))\Pi_{\mathrm{ex}}((\lambda_{2},g_{2}))=%

 \psi_{G_{1}}(H_{2})-\psi_{G_{2}}(H_{1})+[G_{1},G_{2}]_{\mathfrak{g}}.     Cohomology  For the present purposes, consideration of a limited portion of the theory Lie algebra cohomology suffices. The definitions are not the most general possible, or even the most common ones, but the objects they refer to are authentic instances of more the general definitions.  2-cocycles The objects of primary interest are the 2-cocycles on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   , defined as bilinear  alternating functions,       ϕ  :    𝔤  ×  𝔤   →  F    ,     normal-:  ϕ   normal-→    𝔤  𝔤   F     \phi:\mathfrak{g}\times\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow F,   that are alternating,        ϕ   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )    =   -   ϕ   (   G  2   ,   G  1   )      ,        ϕ    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2         ϕ    subscript  G  2    subscript  G  1        \phi(G_{1},G_{2})=-\phi(G_{2},G_{1}),   and having a property resembling the Jacobi identity called the Jacobi identity for 2-cycles ,        ϕ   (   G  1   ,   [   G  2   ,   G  3   ]   )    +   ϕ   (   G  2   ,   [   G  3   ,   G  1   ]   )    +   ϕ   (   G  3   ,   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   )     =  0.          ϕ    subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2    subscript  G  3        ϕ    subscript  G  2     subscript  G  3    subscript  G  1        ϕ    subscript  G  3     subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2       0.    \phi(G_{1},[G_{2},G_{3}])+\phi(G_{2},[G_{3},G_{1}])+\phi(G_{3},[G_{1},G_{2}])=0.     The set of all 2-cocycles on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is denoted .  2-cocycles from 1-cochains Some 2-cocycles can be obtained from 1-cochains. A 1-cochain on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is simply a linear map,      f  :   𝔤  →  F      normal-:  f   normal-→  𝔤  F     f:\mathfrak{g}\rightarrow F   The set of all such maps is denoted and, of course (in at least the finite-dimensional case) . Using a 1-cochain   f   f   f   , a 2-cocycle    δ  f      δ  f    δf   may be defined by        δ  f   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )    =   f   (   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   )     .        δ  f    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2       f    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2       \delta f(G_{1},G_{2})=f([G_{1},G_{2}]).   The alternating property is immediate and the Jacobi identity for 2-cocycles is (as usual) shown by writing it out and using the definition and properties of the ingredients (here the Jacobi identity on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   and the linearity of   f   f   f   ). The linear map is called the coboundary operator (here restricted to ).  The second cohomology group Denote the image of of   δ   δ   δ   by . The quotient        H  2    (  𝔤  ,  𝔽  )    =      Z  2    (  𝔤  ,  𝔽  )    /   B  2     (  𝔤  ,  𝔽  )           superscript  H  2    𝔤  𝔽           superscript  Z  2    𝔤  𝔽     superscript  B  2     𝔤  𝔽      H^{2}(\mathfrak{g},\mathbb{F})=Z^{2}(\mathfrak{g},\mathbb{F})/B^{2}(\mathfrak{%
 g},\mathbb{F})   is called the second cohomology group of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . Elements of are equivalence classes of 2-cocycles and two 2-cocycles and are called equivalent cocycles if they differ by a 2-coboundary, i.e. if  φ 2 + δf }} for some . Equivalent 2-cocycles are called cohomologous . The equivalence class of is denoted .  These notions generalize in several directions. For this, see the main articles.

Then each    G  ∈  𝐠      G  normal-∈  𝐠    G∈\mathbf{g}   has a unique expression as       G  =    ∑   α  ∈  A      c  α    G  α      ,     c  α   ∈  F   ,    G  α   ∈  B       formulae-sequence    G    subscript     α  A       subscript  c  α    subscript  G  α       formulae-sequence     subscript  c  α   F      subscript  G  α   B      G=\sum_{\alpha\in A}c_{\alpha}G_{\alpha},\quad c_{\alpha}\in F,G_{\alpha}\in B   for some indexing set   A   A   A   of suitable size. In this expansion, only finitely many are nonzero. In the sequel it is (for simplicity) assumed that the basis is countable, and Latin letters are used for the indices and the indexing set can be taken to be 1, 2, ...}} . One immediately has       [   G  i   ,   G  j   ]   =    C   i  j     k    G  k          subscript  G  i    subscript  G  j       superscript   subscript  C    i  j    k    subscript  G  k      [G_{i},G_{j}]={C_{ij}}^{k}G_{k}   for the basis elements, where the summation symbol has been rationalized away, the summation convention applies. The placement of the indices in the structure constants (up or down) is immaterial. The following theorem is useful:  Theorem :There is a basis such that the structure constants are antisymmetric in all indices if and only if the Lie algebra is a direct sum of simple compact Lie algebras and    𝐮   (  1  )       𝐮  1    \mathbf{u}(1)   Lie algebras. This is the case if and only if there is a real positive definite metric   g   g   g   on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   satisfying the invariance condition         g   α  β     C   β   γ  δ      =   -    g   γ  β     C   β   α  δ        .         subscript  g    α  β     subscript   superscript  C  β     γ  δ          subscript  g    γ  β     subscript   superscript  C  β     α  δ        g_{\alpha\beta}{C^{\beta}}_{\gamma\delta}=-g_{\gamma\beta}{C^{\beta}}_{\alpha%
 \delta}.   in any basis. This last condition is necessary on physical grounds for non-Abelian gauge theories in quantum field theory . Thus one can produce an infinite list of possible gauge theories using the Cartan catalog of simple Lie algebras on their compact form (i.e.,    𝐬𝐥   (  n  ,  ℂ  )   →  𝐬𝐮   (  n  )       𝐬𝐥   n  normal-ℂ   normal-→  𝐬𝐮  n    \mathbf{sl}(n,ℂ)→\mathbf{su}(n)   , etc. One such gauge theory is the    U   (  1  )   ×  S  U   (  2  )   ×  S  U   (  3  )       U  1  normal-×  S  U  2  normal-×  S  U  3    U(1)×SU(2)×SU(3)   gauge theory of the standard model with Lie algebra    𝐮   (  1  )   ⊕  𝐬𝐮   (  2  )   ⊕  𝐬𝐮   (  3  )       𝐮  1  normal-⊕  𝐬𝐮  2  normal-⊕  𝐬𝐮  3    \mathbf{u}(1)⊕\mathbf{su}(2)⊕\mathbf{su}(3)   . 37  Killing form  The Killing form is a symmetric bilinear form on   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   defined by        K   (   G  1   ,   G  2   )    =   trace   (    ad   G  1     ad   G  2     )     .        K    subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2       trace     subscript  ad   subscript  G  1     subscript  ad   subscript  G  2        K(G_{1},G_{2})=\mathrm{trace}(\mathrm{ad}_{G_{1}}\mathrm{ad}_{G_{2}}).   Here is viewed as a matrix operating on the vector space   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . The key fact needed is that if   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is semisimple , then, by Cartan's criterion ,   K   K   K   is non-degenerate. In such a case   K   K   K   may be used to identify   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   and . If , then there is a  G λ ∈ g }} such that         ⟨  λ  ,  G  ⟩   =   K   (   G  λ   ,  G  )       ∀  G   ∈  𝔤    .     formulae-sequence     λ  G     K    subscript  G  λ   G        for-all  G   𝔤     \langle\lambda,G\rangle=K(G_{\lambda},G)\quad\forall G\in\mathfrak{g}.   This is resembling Riesz representation theorem and the proof is virtually the same. The Killing form has the property        K   (   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]   ,   G  3   )    =   K   (   G  1   ,   [   G  2   ,   G  3   ]   )     ,        K     subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2     subscript  G  3       K    subscript  G  1     subscript  G  2    subscript  G  3        K([G_{1},G_{2}],G_{3})=K(G_{1},[G_{2},G_{3}]),   which is referred to as associativity. By defining  K [ G α , G β ]}} and expanding the inner brackets in terms of structure constants, one finds that the Killing form satisfies the invariance condition of above.  Loop algebra  A loop group is taken as a group of smooth maps from the unit circle into a Lie group   G   G   G   with the group structure defined by the group structure on   G   G   G   . The Lie algebra of a loop group is then a vector space of mappings from into the Lie algebra   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   of   G   G   G   . Any subalgebra of such a Lie algebra is referred to as a loop algebra . Attention here is focused on polynomial loop algebras of the form       {  h  :   S  1   →  𝔤  |  h   (  λ  )   =  ∑   λ  n    G  n   ,  n  ∈  ℤ  ,  λ  =   e   i  θ    ∈   S  1   ,   G  n   ∈  𝔤  }   .     fragments   fragments  normal-{  h  normal-:   superscript  S  1   normal-→  g  normal-|  h   fragments  normal-(  λ  normal-)      superscript  λ  n    subscript  G  n   normal-,  n   Z  normal-,  λ    superscript  e    i  θ      superscript  S  1   normal-,   subscript  G  n    g  normal-}   normal-.    \{h:S^{1}\to\mathfrak{g}|h(\lambda)=\sum\lambda^{n}G_{n},n\in\mathbb{Z},%
 \lambda=e^{i\theta}\in S^{1},G_{n}\in\mathfrak{g}\}.   To see this, consider elements    H   (  λ  )       H  λ    H(λ)   near the identity in   G   G   G   for   H   H   H   in the loop group, expressed in a basis  for   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}           H   (  λ  )    =   e    h  k    (  λ  )    G  k     =    e  G   +    h  k    (  λ  )    G  k    +  …    ,          H  λ    superscript  e     superscript  h  k   λ   subscript  G  k             subscript  e  G      superscript  h  k   λ   subscript  G  k    normal-…      H(\lambda)=e^{h^{k}(\lambda)G_{k}}=e_{G}+h^{k}(\lambda)G_{k}+\ldots,   where the are real and small and the implicit sum is over the dimension   K   K   K   of   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . Now write        h  k    (  λ  )    =    ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     θ   -  n   k    λ  n            superscript  h  k   λ     superscript   subscript     n             subscript   superscript  θ  k     n     superscript  λ  n       h^{k}(\lambda)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\theta^{k}_{-n}\lambda^{n}   to obtain        e    h  k    (  λ  )    G  k     =    1  G   +    ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     θ   -  n   k    λ  n    G  k     +  …    .       superscript  e     superscript  h  k   λ   subscript  G  k        subscript  1  G     superscript   subscript     n             subscript   superscript  θ  k     n     superscript  λ  n    subscript  G  k     normal-…     e^{h^{k}(\lambda)G_{k}}=1_{G}+\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\theta^{k}_{-n}\lambda^%
 {n}G_{k}+\ldots.   Thus the functions      h  :     S  1   →  𝔤   ;    h   (  λ  )    =    ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     ∑   k  =  1   K     θ   -  n   k    λ  n    G  k      ≡    ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     λ  n    G  n          normal-:  h   formulae-sequence   normal-→   superscript  S  1   𝔤         h  λ     superscript   subscript     n            superscript   subscript     k  1    K      subscript   superscript  θ  k     n     superscript  λ  n    subscript  G  k             superscript   subscript     n             superscript  λ  n    subscript  G  n          h:S^{1}\to\mathfrak{g};h(\lambda)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\sum_{k=1}^{K}%
 \theta^{k}_{-n}\lambda^{n}G_{k}\equiv\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\lambda^{n}G_{n}   constitute the Lie algebra.  A little thought confirms that these are loops in   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   as   θ   θ   θ   goes from   0   0    to    2  π      2  π    2π   . The operations are the ones defined pointwise by the operations in   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . This algebra is isomorphic with the algebra        C   [  λ  ,   λ   -  1    ]    ⊗  𝔤   ,     tensor-product    C   λ   superscript  λ    1      𝔤    C[\lambda,\lambda^{-1}]\otimes\mathfrak{g},   where is the algebra of Laurent polynomials ,        ∑    λ  k    G  k     ↔   ∑    λ  k   ⊗   G  k      .     normal-↔       superscript  λ  k    subscript  G  k        tensor-product   superscript  λ  k    subscript  G  k       \sum\lambda^{k}G_{k}\leftrightarrow\sum\lambda^{k}\otimes G_{k}.   The Lie bracket is        [    P   (  λ  )    ⊗   G  1    ,    Q   (  λ  )    ⊗   G  2    ]   =    P   (  λ  )   Q   (  λ  )    ⊗   [   G  1   ,   G  2   ]     .        tensor-product    P  λ    subscript  G  1     tensor-product    Q  λ    subscript  G  2      tensor-product    P  λ  Q  λ     subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2       [P(\lambda)\otimes G_{1},Q(\lambda)\otimes G_{2}]=P(\lambda)Q(\lambda)\otimes[%
 G_{1},G_{2}].   In this latter view the elements can be considered as polynomials with (constant!) coefficients in   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   . In terms of a basis and structure constants,        [    λ  m   ⊗   G  i    ,    λ  n   ⊗   G  j    ]   =     C   i  j     k    λ   m  +  n     ⊗   G  k     .        tensor-product   superscript  λ  m    subscript  G  i     tensor-product   superscript  λ  n    subscript  G  j      tensor-product     superscript   subscript  C    i  j    k    superscript  λ    m  n      subscript  G  k      [\lambda^{m}\otimes G_{i},\lambda^{n}\otimes G_{j}]={C_{ij}}^{k}\lambda^{m+n}%
 \otimes G_{k}.     It is also common to have a different notation,          λ  m   ⊗   G  i    ≅    λ  m    G  i     ↔     T  i  m    (  λ  )    ≡   T  i  m     ,     normal-↔     tensor-product   superscript  λ  m    subscript  G  i       superscript  λ  m    subscript  G  i          subscript   superscript  T  m   i   λ    subscript   superscript  T  m   i      \lambda^{m}\otimes G_{i}\cong\lambda^{m}G_{i}\leftrightarrow T^{m}_{i}(\lambda%
 )\equiv T^{m}_{i},   where the omission of   λ   λ   λ   should be kept in mind to avoid confusion; the elements really are functions . The Lie bracket is then        [   T  i  m   ,   T  j  n   ]   =    C   i  j     k    T  k   m  +  n      ,        subscript   superscript  T  m   i    subscript   superscript  T  n   j       superscript   subscript  C    i  j    k    subscript   superscript  T    m  n    k      [T^{m}_{i},T^{n}_{j}]={C_{ij}}^{k}T^{m+n}_{k},   which is recognizable as one of the commutation relations in an untwisted affine Kac–Moody algebra, to be introduced later, without the central term. With    m  =  n  =  0        m  n       0     m=n=0   , a subalgebra isomorphic to   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   is obtained. It generates (as seen by tracing backwards in the definitions) the set of constant maps from into   G   G   G   , which is obviously isomorphic with   G   G   G   when    e  x  p      e  x  p    exp   is onto (which is the case when   G   G   G   is compact. If   G   G   G   is compact, then a basis for   𝐠   𝐠   \mathbf{g}   may be chosen such that the are skew-Hermitian. As a consequence,        T  i   n  †    =    (    λ  n    G  i    )   †   =   -    λ   -  n     G  i     =   -   T  i   -  n      .         superscript   subscript  T  i    n  normal-†     superscript     superscript  λ  n    subscript  G  i    normal-†             superscript  λ    n     subscript  G  i             superscript   subscript  T  i     n        T_{i}^{n\dagger}=(\lambda^{n}G_{i})^{\dagger}=-\lambda^{-n}G_{i}=-T_{i}^{-n}.   Such a representation is called unitary because the representatives       H   (  λ  )    =   e    θ  n  k    T  k   -  n      ∈  G          H  λ    superscript  e     superscript   subscript  θ  n   k    superscript   subscript  T  k     n           G     H(\lambda)=e^{\theta_{n}^{k}T_{k}^{-n}}\in G   are unitary. Here, the minus on the lower index of   T   T   T   is conventional, the summation convention applies, and the   λ   λ   λ   is (by the definition) buried in the   T   T   T   s in the right hand side.  Current algebra (physics)  Current algebras arise in quantum field theories as a consequence of global gauge symmetry . Conserved currents occur in classical field theories whenever the Lagrangian respects a continuous symmetry . This is the content of Noether's theorem . Most (perhaps all) modern quantum field theories can be formulated in terns of classical Lagrangians (prior to quantization), so Noether's theorem applies in the quantum case as well. Upon quantization, the conserved currents are promoted to position dependent operators on Hilbert space. These operators are subject to commutation relations, generally forming an infinite-dimensional Lie algebra. A model illustrating this is presented below.  To enhance the flavor of physics, factors of   i   i   i   will appear here and there as opposed to in the mathematical conventions. 38  Consider a column vector   Φ   normal-Φ   Φ   of scalar fields  . Let the Lagrangian density be       ℒ  =      ∂  μ    ϕ  †      ∂  μ   ϕ    -    m  2    ϕ  †   ϕ     .      ℒ        subscript   μ    superscript  ϕ  normal-†      superscript   μ   ϕ       superscript  m  2    superscript  ϕ  normal-†   ϕ      \mathcal{L}=\partial_{\mu}\phi^{\dagger}\partial^{\mu}\phi-m^{2}\phi^{\dagger}\phi.     This Lagrangian is invariant under the transformation 39       ϕ  ↦    e   -   i     ∑   a  =  1   r      α  a    F  a        ϕ    ,     maps-to  ϕ     superscript  e      i    superscript   subscript     a  1    r      superscript  α  a    subscript  F  a        ϕ     \phi\mapsto e^{-i\sum_{a=1}^{r}\alpha^{a}F_{a}}\phi,     where  are generators of either    U   (  N  )       U  N    U(N)   or a closed subgroup thereof, satisfying        [   F  a   ,   F  b   ]   =   i   C   a  b     c    F  c     .        subscript  F  a    subscript  F  b      i   superscript   subscript  C    a  b    c    subscript  F  c      [F_{a},F_{b}]=i{C_{ab}}^{c}F_{c}.     Noether's theorem asserts the existence of   r   r   r   conserved currents,         J  a  μ   =   -    π  μ   i   F  a   ϕ     ,    π   k  μ    =    ∂  ℒ    ∂   (    ∂  μ    ϕ  k    )       ,     formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  J  a   μ        superscript  π  μ   i   subscript  F  a   ϕ        superscript  π    k  μ        ℒ       subscript   μ    subscript  ϕ  k         J_{a}^{\mu}=-\pi^{\mu}iF_{a}\phi,\quad\pi^{k\mu}=\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{%
 \partial(\partial_{\mu}\phi_{k})},     where is the momentum canonically conjugate to . The reason these currents are said to be conserved is because         ∂  μ    J  a  μ    =  0   ,        subscript   μ    subscript   superscript  J  μ   a    0    \partial_{\mu}J^{\mu}_{a}=0,   and consequently         Q  a    (  t  )    =   ∫    J  a  0    d  3   x    =  const  ≡   Q  a    ,           subscript  Q  a   t        subscript   superscript  J  0   a    superscript  d  3   x         const        subscript  Q  a      Q_{a}(t)=\int J^{0}_{a}d^{3}x=\mathrm{const}\equiv Q_{a},     the charge associated to the charge density  is constant in time. 40 This (so far classical) theory is quantized promoting the fields and their conjugates to operators on Hilbert space and by postulating (bosonic quantization) the commutation relations 41 42      [    ϕ  k    (  t  ,  x  )    ,    π  l    (  t  ,  x  )    ]        subscript  ϕ  k    t  x       superscript  π  l    t  x      \displaystyle{}[\phi_{k}(t,x),\pi^{l}(t,x)]   The currents accordingly become operators 43 They satisfy, using the above postulated relations, the definitions and integration over space, the commutation relations      [    J  a  0    (  t  ,  𝐱  )    ,    J  b  0    (  t  ,  𝐲  )    ]        superscript   subscript  J  a   0    t  𝐱       superscript   subscript  J  b   0    t  𝐲      \displaystyle{}[J_{a}^{0}(t,\mathbf{x}),J_{b}^{0}(t,\mathbf{y})]   where the speed of light and the reduced Planck's constant have been set to unity. The last commutation relation does not follow from the postulated commutation relations (these are fixed only for , not for ), except for    μ  =  0      μ  0    μ=0   For    μ  =   1  ,  2  ,  3       μ   1  2  3     μ=1,2,3   the Lorentz transformation behavior is used to deduce the conclusion. The next commutator to consider is        [    J  a  0    (  t  ,  𝐱  )    ,    J  b  i    (  t  ,  𝐲  )    ]   =    i   C   a  b     c    J  c  i    (  t  ,  𝐱  )   δ   (   𝐱  -  𝐲   )    +    S   a  b    i  j      ∂  j   δ    (   𝐱  -  𝐲   )    +  …    .          superscript   subscript  J  a   0    t  𝐱       superscript   subscript  J  b   i    t  𝐲         i   superscript   subscript  C    a  b    c    superscript   subscript  J  c   i    t  𝐱   δ    𝐱  𝐲       superscript   subscript  S    a  b      i  j      subscript   j   δ     𝐱  𝐲    normal-…     [J_{a}^{0}(t,\mathbf{x}),J_{b}^{i}(t,\mathbf{y})]=i{C_{ab}}^{c}J_{c}^{i}(t,%
 \mathbf{x})\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})+S_{ab}^{ij}\partial_{j}\delta(\mathbf%
 {x}-\mathbf{y})+....   The presence of the delta functions and their derivatives is explained by the requirement of microcausality that implies that the commutator vanishes when    𝐱  ≠  𝐲      𝐱  normal-≠  𝐲    \mathbf{x}≠\mathbf{y}   . Thus the commutator must be a distribution supported at    𝐱  =  𝐲      𝐱  𝐲    \mathbf{x}=\mathbf{y}   . 44 The first term is fixed due to the requirement that the equation should, when integrated over   𝐗   𝐗   \mathbf{X}   , reduce to the last equation before it. The following terms are the Schwinger terms . They integrate to zero, but it can be shown quite generally 45 that they must be nonzero.  Consider a conserved current  with a generic Schwinger term        [    J  0    (  t  ,  𝐱  )    ,    J  i    (  t  ,  𝐲  )    ]   =    i  δ   (   𝐱  -  𝐲   )    J  i    (  t  ,  𝐱  )    +    C  i    (  𝐱  ,  𝐲  )      .          superscript  J  0    t  𝐱       superscript  J  i    t  𝐲         i  δ    𝐱  𝐲    superscript  J  i    t  𝐱       superscript  C  i    𝐱  𝐲       [J^{0}(t,\mathbf{x}),J^{i}(t,\mathbf{y})]=i\delta(\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y})J^{i}(%

Relativistic classical string theory  A classical relativistic string traces out a world sheet in spacetime, just like a point particle traces out a world line. This world sheet can locally be parametrized using two parameters   σ   σ   σ   and   τ   τ   τ   . Points in spacetime can, in the range of the parametrization, be written  x μ ( σ , τ )}} . One uses a capital   X   X   X   to denote points in spacetime actually being on the world sheet of the string. Thus the string parametrization is given by . The inverse of the parametrization provides a local coordinate system on the world sheet in the sense of manifolds .  The equations of motion of a classical relativistic string derived in the Lagrangian formalism from the Nambu–Goto action are 47           ∂   𝒫  μ  τ     ∂  τ    +    ∂   𝒫  μ  σ     ∂  σ     =  0   ,     𝒫  μ  τ   =   -     T  0   c       (    X  ˙   ⋅   X  ′    )    X  μ  ′    -     (   X  ′   )   2     X  ˙   μ         (    X  ˙   ⋅   X  ′    )   2   -     (   X  ˙   )   2     (   X  ′   )   2          ,    𝒫  μ  σ   =   -     T  0   c       (    X  ˙   ⋅   X  ′    )    X  μ  ′    -     (   X  ˙   )   2    X  μ  ′         (    X  ˙   ⋅   X  ′    )   2   -     (   X  ˙   )   2     (   X  ′   )   2            .     formulae-sequence           superscript   subscript  𝒫  μ   τ      τ         superscript   subscript  𝒫  μ   σ      σ     0    formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript  𝒫  μ   τ          subscript  T  0   c          normal-⋅   normal-˙  X    superscript  X  normal-′     subscript   superscript  X  normal-′   μ       superscript   superscript  X  normal-′   2    subscript   normal-˙  X   μ          superscript   normal-⋅   normal-˙  X    superscript  X  normal-′    2      superscript   normal-˙  X   2    superscript   superscript  X  normal-′   2             superscript   subscript  𝒫  μ   σ          subscript  T  0   c          normal-⋅   normal-˙  X    superscript  X  normal-′     subscript   superscript  X  normal-′   μ       superscript   normal-˙  X   2    subscript   superscript  X  normal-′   μ          superscript   normal-⋅   normal-˙  X    superscript  X  normal-′    2      superscript   normal-˙  X   2    superscript   superscript  X  normal-′   2             \frac{\partial\mathcal{P}_{\mu}^{\tau}}{\partial\tau}+\frac{\partial\mathcal{P%

A dot between quantities denotes the relativistic inner product.  These rather formidable equations simplify considerably with a clever choice of parametrization called the light cone gauge . In this gauge, the equations of motion become          X  ¨   μ   -   X   μ   ′′    =  0   ,         superscript   normal-¨  X   μ    superscript   superscript  X  μ   ′′    0    \ddot{X}^{\mu}-{X^{\mu}}^{\prime\prime}=0,   the ordinary wave equation . The price to be paid is that the light cone gauge imposes constraints,           X  ˙   μ   ⋅   X   μ   ′    =  0   ,      (   X  ˙   )   2   +    (   X  ′   )   2    =  0    ,     formulae-sequence     normal-⋅   superscript   normal-˙  X   μ    superscript   superscript  X  μ   normal-′    0        superscript   normal-˙  X   2    superscript   superscript  X  normal-′   2    0     \dot{X}^{\mu}\cdot{X^{\mu}}^{\prime}=0,\quad(\dot{X})^{2}+(X^{\prime})^{2}=0,   so that one cannot simply take arbitrary solutions of the wave equation to represent the strings. The strings considered here are open strings, i.e. they don't close up on themselves. This means that the Neumann boundary conditions have to be imposed on the endpoints. With this, the general solution of the wave equation (excluding constraints) is given by         X  μ    (  σ  ,  τ  )    =     x  0  μ   +   2   α  ′    p  0  μ   τ    -   i    2   α  ′       ∑   n  =  1      (     a  n   μ  *     e   i  n  τ     -    a  n  μ    e   -   i  n  τ       )     cos   n  σ     n         ,         superscript  X  μ    σ  τ         superscript   subscript  x  0   μ     2   superscript  α  normal-′    superscript   subscript  p  0   μ   τ      i      2   superscript  α  normal-′       subscript     n  1           superscript   subscript  a  n    μ      superscript  e    i  n  τ        superscript   subscript  a  n   μ    superscript  e      i  n  τ             n  σ      n          X^{\mu}(\sigma,\tau)=x_{0}^{\mu}+2\alpha^{\prime}p_{0}^{\mu}\tau-i\sqrt{2%
