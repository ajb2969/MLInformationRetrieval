   Egorov's theorem      Egorov's theorem   In measure theory , an area of mathematics , Egorov's theorem establishes a condition for the uniform convergence of a pointwise convergent  sequence of measurable functions . It is also named Severini–Egoroff theorem or Severini–Egorov theorem , after Carlo Severini , an Italian  mathematician , and Dmitri Egorov , a Russian  physicist and geometer , who published independent proofs respectively in 1910 and 1911.  Egorov's theorem can be used along with compactly supported  continuous functions to prove Lusin's theorem for integrable functions .  Historical note  The first proof of the theorem was given by Carlo Severini in 1910 and was published in : he used the result as a tool in his research on series of orthogonal functions . His work remained apparently unnoticed outside Italy , probably due to the fact that it is written in Italian , appeared in a scientific journal with limited diffusion and was considered only as a means to obtain other theorems. A year later Dmitri Egorov published his independently proved results in the note , and the theorem became widely known under his name: however it is not uncommon to find references to this theorem as the Severini–Egoroff theorem or Severini–Egorov Theorem. According to  and , the first mathematicians to prove independently the theorem in the nowadays common abstract measure space setting were Frigyes Riesz in , , and Wacław Sierpiński in : an earlier generalization is due to Nikolai Luzin , who succeeded in slightly relaxing the requirement of finiteness of measure of the domain of convergence of the pointwise converging functions in the ample paper , as  recalls. Further generalizations were given much later by Pavel Korovkin , in the paper , and by Gabriel Mokobodzki in the paper  The formal statement of the theorem and its proof  Statement of the theorem  Let ( f n ) be a sequence of M -valued measurable functions, where M is a separable metric space, on some measure space ( X ,Σ,μ), and suppose there is a measurable subset  A of finite μ-measure such that ( f n ) converges μ- almost everywhere on A to a limit function f . The following result holds: for every ε > 0, there exists a measurable subset  B of A such that μ( B ) n'') converges to f uniformly on the relative complement  A \ B .  Here, μ( B ) denotes the μ-measure of B . In words, the theorem says that pointwise convergence almost everywhere on A implies the apparently much stronger uniform convergence everywhere except on some subset B of arbitrarily small measure. This type of convergence is also called almost uniform convergence .  Discussion of assumptions and a counterexample   The hypothesis μ( A ) < ∞ is necessary. To see this, it is simple to construct a counterexample when μ is the Lebesgue measure : consider the sequence of real-valued indicator functions             f  n    (  x  )    =    1   [  n  ,   n  +  1   ]     (  x  )     ,    n  ∈  ℕ   ,   x  ∈  ℝ     ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  f  n   x      subscript  1   n    n  1     x     formulae-sequence    n  ℕ     x  ℝ      f_{n}(x)=1_{[n,n+1]}(x),\qquad n\in\mathbb{N},\ x\in\mathbb{R},         defined on the real line . This sequence converges pointwise to the zero function everywhere but does not converge uniformly on ℝ \ B for any set B of finite measure: a counterexample in the general    n   n   n   -dimensional  real vector space ℝ n can be constructed as shown by .    The separability of the metric space is needed to make sure that for M -valued, measurable functions f and g , the distance d ( f ( x ), g ( x )) is again a measurable real-valued function of x .   Proof  For natural numbers n and k , define the set E n,k by the union        E   n  ,  k    =    ⋃   m  ≥  n     {   x  ∈   A    |    |     f  m    (  x  )    -   f   (  x  )     |   ≥   1  k    }     .       subscript  E   n  k      subscript     m  n     conditional-set    x  A            subscript  f  m   x     f  x       1  k        E_{n,k}=\bigcup_{m\geq n}\left\{x\in A\,\Big|\,|f_{m}(x)-f(x)|\geq\frac{1}{k}%
 \right\}.     These sets get smaller as n increases, meaning that E n +1, k is always a subset of E n,k , because the first union involves fewer sets. A point x , for which the sequence ( f m ( x )) converges to f ( x ), cannot be in every E n,k for a fixed k , because f m ( x ) has to stay closer to f ( x ) than 1/ k eventually. Hence by the assumption of μ-almost everywhere pointwise convergence on A ,       μ   (    ⋂   n  ∈  ℕ     E   n  ,  k     )    =  0        μ    subscript     n  ℕ     subscript  E   n  k      0    \mu\biggl(\bigcap_{n\in\mathbb{N}}E_{n,k}\biggr)=0     for every k . Since A is of finite measure, we have continuity from above; hence there exists, for each k , some natural number n k such that        μ   (   E    n  k   ,  k    )    <   ε   2  k     .        μ   subscript  E    subscript  n  k   k       ε   superscript  2  k      \mu(E_{n_{k},k})<\frac{\varepsilon}{2^{k}}.     For x in this set we consider the speed of approach into the 1/ k - neighbourhood of f ( x ) as too slow. Define      B  =    ⋃   k  ∈  ℕ     E    n  k   ,  k         B    subscript     k  ℕ     subscript  E    subscript  n  k   k       B=\bigcup_{k\in\mathbb{N}}E_{n_{k},k}     as the set of all those points x in A , for which the speed of approach into at least one of these 1/ k -neighbourhoods of f ( x ) is too slow. On the set difference A \ B we therefore have uniform convergence.  Appealing to the sigma additivity of μ and using the geometric series , we get        μ   (  B  )    ≤    ∑   k  ∈  ℕ     μ   (   E    n  k   ,  k    )     <    ∑   k  ∈  ℕ     ε   2  k     =  ε   .          μ  B     subscript     k  ℕ      μ   subscript  E    subscript  n  k   k             subscript     k  ℕ      ε   superscript  2  k          ε     \mu(B)\leq\sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\mu(E_{n_{k},k})<\sum_{k\in\mathbb{N}}\frac{%
 \varepsilon}{2^{k}}=\varepsilon.     Generalizations  Luzin's version  Nikolai Luzin 's generalization of the Severini–Egorov theorem is presented here according to .  Statement  Under the same hypothesis of the abstract Severini–Egorov theorem suppose that A is the union of a sequence of measurable sets of finite μ-measure, and ( f n ) is a given sequence of M -valued measurable functions on some measure space ( X ,Σ,μ), such that ( f n ) converges μ- almost everywhere on A to a limit function f , then A can be expressed as the union of a sequence of measurable sets H , A 1 , A 2 ,... such that μ( H ) = 0 and ( f n ) converges to f uniformly on each set A k .  Proof  It is sufficient to consider the case in which the set A is itself of finite μ-measure: using this hypothesis and the standard Severini–Egorov theorem, it is possible to define by mathematical induction a sequence of sets { A k } k=1,2,... such that       μ   (   A  ∖    ⋃   k  =  1   N    A  k     )    ≤   1  N         μ    A    superscript   subscript     k  1    N    subscript  A  k        1  N     \mu\left(A\setminus\bigcup_{k=1}^{N}A_{k}\right)\leq\frac{1}{N}   and such that ( f n ) converges to f uniformly on each set A k for each k . Choosing      H  =   A  ∖    ⋃   k  =  1   ∞    A  k         H    A    superscript   subscript     k  1       subscript  A  k       H=A\setminus\bigcup_{k=1}^{\infty}A_{k}   then obviously μ( H ) = 0 and the theorem is proved.  Korovkin's version  The proof of the Korovkin version follows closely the version on , which however generalizes it to some extent by considering admissible functionals instead of non-negative measures and inequalities    ≤     \scriptstyle\leq   and   ≥     \scriptstyle\geq   respectively in conditions 1 and 2.  Statement  Let ( M , d ) denote a separable  metric space and ( X ,Σ) a measurable space : consider a measurable set  A and a class    𝔄   𝔄   \scriptstyle\mathfrak{A}   containing A and its measurable subsets such that their countable in unions and intersections belong to the same class. Suppose there exists a non-negative measure μ such that μ( A ) exists and   μ(   ∩     \scriptstyle\cap    A n )=   lim     \scriptstyle\lim   μ( A n ) if A 1    ⊃   superset-of   \scriptstyle\supset    A 2    ⊃   superset-of   \scriptstyle\supset   ... with A n      ∈  𝔄      absent  𝔄    \scriptstyle\in\mathfrak{A}   for all n  μ(   ∪     \scriptstyle\cup    A n )=   lim     \scriptstyle\lim   μ( A n ) if A 1    ⊂     \scriptstyle\subset    A 2    ⊂     \scriptstyle\subset   ... with   ∪     \scriptstyle\cup    A n      ∈  𝔄      absent  𝔄    \scriptstyle\in\mathfrak{A}   .   If ( f n ) is a sequence of M-valued measurable functions converging μ- almost everywhere on A      ∈  𝔄      absent  𝔄    \scriptstyle\in\mathfrak{A}   to a limit function f , then there exists a subset  A′ of A such that 0 \scriptstyle\in\mathbb{N}, defined as follows:       A   0  ,  m    =   {   x  ∈  A   |    d   (    f  n    (  x  )    ,   f   (  x  )    )    ≤    1    ∀  n    ≥  m   }        subscript  A   0  m     conditional-set    x  A         d      subscript  f  n   x     f  x       1   for-all  n         m       A_{0,m}=\left\{x\in A|d(f_{n}(x),f(x))\leq 1\ \forall n\geq m\right\}   Obiviously       A   0  ,  1    ⊆   A   0  ,  2    ⊆   A   0  ,  3    ⊆  …         subscript  A   0  1     subscript  A   0  2          subscript  A   0  3         normal-…     A_{0,1}\subseteq A_{0,2}\subseteq A_{0,3}\subseteq\dots   and      A  =    ⋃   m  ∈  ℕ     A   0  ,  m         A    subscript     m  ℕ     subscript  A   0  m       A=\bigcup_{m\in\mathbb{N}}A_{0,m}   therefore there is a natural number  m 0 such that putting A 0,m 0 = A 0 the following relation holds true:      0  ≤    μ   (  A  )    -   μ   (   A  0   )     ≤  ε        0      μ  A     μ   subscript  A  0          ε     0\leq\mu(A)-\mu(A_{0})\leq\varepsilon   Using A 0 it is possible to define the following indexed family       A   1  ,  m    =   {   x  ∈   A  0    |    d   (    f  m    (  x  )    ,   f   (  x  )    )    ≤     1  2     ∀  n    ≥  m   }        subscript  A   1  m     conditional-set    x   subscript  A  0          d      subscript  f  m   x     f  x         1  2    for-all  n         m       A_{1,m}=\left\{x\in A_{0}\left|d(f_{m}(x),f(x))\leq\frac{1}{2}\ \forall n\geq m%
