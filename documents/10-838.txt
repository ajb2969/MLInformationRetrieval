   Tetrahydrocolumbamine 2-O-methyltransferase      Tetrahydrocolumbamine 2-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a tetrahydrocolumbamine 2-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 5,8,13,13a-tetrahydrocolumbamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + tetrahydropalmatine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 5,8,13,13a-tetrahydrocolumbamine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and tetrahydropalmatine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:5,8,13,13a-tetrahydrocolumbamine 2-O-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called tetrahydrocolumbamine methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in alkaloid biosynthesis i .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
