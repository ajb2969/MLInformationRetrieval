Young measure

In mathematical analysis, a Young measure is a parameterized measure that is associated with certain subsequences of a given bounded sequence of measurable functions. Young measures have applications in the calculus of variations and the study of nonlinear partial differential equations, as well as in various optimization (or optimal control problems). They are named after Laurence Chisholm Young who invented them, however, in terms of linear functionals already in 1937 still before the measure theory has been developed.
Definition
We let 
 
 
 
  be a bounded sequence in 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes an open bounded subset of 
 
 
 
 
 . Then there exists a subsequence 
 
 
 
  and for almost every 
 
 
 
  a Borel probability measure

 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that for each 
 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . The measures 
 
 
 
  are called the Young measures generated by the sequence 
 
 
 
 .
Example
Every minimizing sequence of 
 
 
 
 
  subject to 
 
 
 
  generates the Young measures 
 
 
 
 . This captures the essential features of all minimizing sequences to this problem, namely developing finer and finer slopes of 
 
 
 
  (or close to 
 
 
 
 ).
