   Young measure      Young measure   In mathematical analysis , a Young measure is a parameterized measure that is associated with certain subsequences of a given bounded sequence of measurable functions. Young measures have applications in the calculus of variations and the study of nonlinear  partial differential equations , as well as in various optimization (or optimal control problems). They are named after Laurence Chisholm Young who invented them, however, in terms of linear functionals already in 1937 still before the measure theory has been developed.  Definition  We let     {   f  k   }    k  =  1   ∞     superscript   subscript    subscript  f  k      k  1       \{f_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty}   be a bounded sequence in     L  ∞    (  U  ,   ℝ  m   )        superscript  L     U   superscript  ℝ  m      L^{\infty}(U,\mathbb{R}^{m})   , where   U   U   U   denotes an open bounded subset of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   . Then there exists a subsequence      {   f   k  j    }    j  =  1   ∞   ⊂    {   f  k   }    k  =  1   ∞        superscript   subscript    subscript  f   subscript  k  j       j  1       superscript   subscript    subscript  f  k      k  1        \{f_{k_{j}}\}_{j=1}^{\infty}\subset\{f_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty}   and for almost every    x  ∈  U      x  U    x\in U   a Borel probability measure     ν  x     subscript  ν  x    \nu_{x}   on    ℝ  m     superscript  ℝ  m    \mathbb{R}^{m}   such that for each    F  ∈   C   (   ℝ  m   )        F    C   superscript  ℝ  m      F\in C(\mathbb{R}^{m})   we have    F   (   f   k  j    )    ⇀  ∗     ∫   ℝ  m     F   (  y  )   d   ν  ⋅    (  y  )         F   subscript  f   subscript  k  j     normal-∗  normal-⇀     subscript    superscript  ℝ  m      F  y  d   subscript  ν  normal-⋅   y      F(f_{k_{j}})\overset{\ast}{\rightharpoonup}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{m}}F(y)d\nu_{%
 \cdot}(y)   in     L  ∞    (  U  )        superscript  L    U    L^{\infty}(U)   . The measures    ν  x     subscript  ν  x    \nu_{x}   are called the Young measures generated by the sequence     {   f  k   }    k  =  1   ∞     superscript   subscript    subscript  f  k      k  1       \{f_{k}\}_{k=1}^{\infty}   .  Example  Every minimizing sequence of     I   (  u  )    =     ∫  0  1     (    u  x  2   -  1   )   2    +    u  2   d  x          I  u       superscript   subscript   0   1    superscript     superscript   subscript  u  x   2   1   2       superscript  u  2   d  x      I(u)=\int_{0}^{1}(u_{x}^{2}-1)^{2}+u^{2}dx   subject to     u   (  0  )    =   u   (  1  )    =  0          u  0     u  1        0     u(0)=u(1)=0   generates the Young measures     ν  x   =     1  2    δ   -  1     +    1  2    δ  1          subscript  ν  x         1  2    subscript  δ    1         1  2    subscript  δ  1       \nu_{x}=\frac{1}{2}\delta_{-1}+\frac{1}{2}\delta_{1}   . This captures the essential features of all minimizing sequences to this problem, namely developing finer and finer slopes of    ±  1     plus-or-minus  1    \pm 1   (or close to    ±  1     plus-or-minus  1    \pm 1   ).
