   Vector potential      Vector potential   In vector calculus , a vector potential is a vector field whose curl is a given vector field. This is analogous to a scalar potential , which is a scalar field whose gradient is a given vector field.  Formally, given a vector field v , a vector potential is a vector A such that       𝐯  =   ∇  ×  𝐀    .      𝐯    normal-∇  𝐀     \mathbf{v}=\nabla\times\mathbf{A}.     If a vector field v admits a vector potential A , then from the equality       ∇  ⋅   (   ∇  ×  𝐀   )    =  0       normal-⋅  normal-∇    normal-∇  𝐀    0    \nabla\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})=0   ( divergence of the curl is zero) one obtains        ∇  ⋅  𝐯   =   ∇  ⋅   (   ∇  ×  𝐀   )    =  0   ,         normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐯    normal-⋅  normal-∇    normal-∇  𝐀         0     \nabla\cdot\mathbf{v}=\nabla\cdot(\nabla\times\mathbf{A})=0,   which implies that v must be a solenoidal vector field .  Theorem  Let      𝐯  :    ℝ  3   →   ℝ  3       normal-:  𝐯   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  3    superscript  ℝ  3      \mathbf{v}:\mathbb{R}^{3}\to\mathbb{R}^{3}   be a solenoidal vector field which is twice continuously differentiable . Assume that v ( x ) decreases sufficiently fast as || x ||→∞. Define        𝐀   (  𝐱  )    =     1   4  π    ∇   ×    ∫   ℝ  3        𝐯   (  𝐲  )     ∥   𝐱  -  𝐲   ∥      d  3   𝐲      .        𝐀  𝐱         1    4  π    normal-∇     subscript    superscript  ℝ  3          𝐯  𝐲    norm    𝐱  𝐲      superscript  d  3   𝐲       \mathbf{A}(\mathbf{x})=\frac{1}{4\pi}\nabla\times\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\frac{%
 \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{y})}{\left\|\mathbf{x}-\mathbf{y}\right\|}\,d^{3}\mathbf{y}.   Then, A is a vector potential for v , that is,        ∇  ×  𝐀   =  𝐯   .        normal-∇  𝐀   𝐯    \nabla\times\mathbf{A}=\mathbf{v}.     A generalization of this theorem is the Helmholtz decomposition which states that any vector field can be decomposed as a sum of a solenoidal vector field and an irrotational vector field .  Nonuniqueness  The vector potential admitted by a solenoidal field is not unique. If A is a vector potential for v , then so is      𝐀  +   ∇  m       𝐀   normal-∇  m     \mathbf{A}+\nabla m   where m is any continuously differentiable scalar function. This follows from the fact that the curl of the gradient is zero.  This nonuniqueness leads to a degree of freedom in the formulation of electrodynamics, or gauge freedom, and requires choosing a gauge .
