   Ĵ      Ĵ   Ĵ or ĵ (J circumflex ) is a letter in Esperanto orthography representing the sound .  While Esperanto orthography uses a diacritic for its four postalveolar consonants, as do the Latin-based Slavic alphabets, the base letters are Romano-Germanic. Ĵ is based on the French pronunciation of the letter j to better preserve the shape of borrowings from that language (such as ĵurnalo from journal ) than Slavic ž would.  Usage  In mathematics   The letter    ȷ  ^     bold-^  bold-italic-ȷ    \boldsymbol{\hat{\jmath}}   is sometimes used to denote a unit vector in mathematics.
