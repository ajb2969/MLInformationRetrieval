   Amott test      Amott test   The Amott test is one of the most widely used empirical wettability measurements for reservoir cores in petroleum engineering . The method combines two spontaneous imbibition measurements and two forced displacement measurements. This test defines two different indices: the Amott water index (    I  w     subscript  I  w    I_{w}   ) and the Amott oil index (    I  o     subscript  I  o    I_{o}   ).  Amott–Harvey index  The two Amott indices are often combined to give the Amott–Harvey index . It is a number between -1 and 1 describing wettability of a rock in drainage processes. It is defined as:       A  I   =    I  w   -   I  o          A  I      subscript  I  w    subscript  I  o      AI=I_{w}-I_{o}   These two indices are obtained from special core analysis (SCAL) experiments ( porous plate or centrifuge ) by plotting the capillary pressure curve as a function of the water saturation as shown on figure 1:       I  w   =     S   s  p  w    -   S   c  w       S   o  r    -   S   c  w           subscript  I  w        subscript  S    s  p  w     subscript  S    c  w        subscript  S    o  r     subscript  S    c  w        I_{w}=\frac{S_{spw}-S_{cw}}{S_{or}-S_{cw}}   with    S   s  p  w      subscript  S    s  p  w     S_{spw}   is the water saturation for a zero capillary pressure during the imbibition process,    S   c  w      subscript  S    c  w     S_{cw}   is the irreducible water saturation and    S   o  r      subscript  S    o  r     S_{or}   is the residual oil saturation after imbibition.       I  o   =     S   o  r    -   S   s  p  o       S   o  r    -   S   c  w           subscript  I  o        subscript  S    o  r     subscript  S    s  p  o        subscript  S    o  r     subscript  S    c  w        I_{o}=\frac{S_{or}-S_{spo}}{S_{or}-S_{cw}}   with    S   s  p  o      subscript  S    s  p  o     S_{spo}   is the oil saturation for a zero capillary pressure during the secondary drainage process,    S   c  w      subscript  S    c  w     S_{cw}   is the irreducible water saturation and    S   o  r      subscript  S    o  r     S_{or}   is the residual non-wetting phase saturation after imbibition.  A rock is defined as:   Water wet when the Amott–Harvey index is between 0.3 and 1,  Weakly water wet when the Amott–Harvey index is between 0 and 0.3,  Weakly oil wet when the Amott–Harvey index is between -0.3 and 0,  Oil wet when the Amott–Harvey index is between -1 and -0.3.
