Sinapate 1-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a sinapate 1-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

UDP-glucose + sinapate 
 
 
 
  UDP + 1-sinapoyl-D-glucose
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and sinapate, whereas its two products are UDP and 1-sinapoyl-D-glucose.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:sinapate D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-sinapate glucosyltransferase, UDP-glucose:sinapic acid glucosyltransferase, uridine 5'-diphosphoglucose-hydroxycinnamic acid, and acylglucosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.
