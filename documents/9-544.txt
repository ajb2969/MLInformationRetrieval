   Grothendieck inequality      Grothendieck inequality   In mathematics , the Grothendieck inequality states that there is a universal constant k with the following property. If a i , j is an n by n ( real or complex ) matrix with       |    ∑   i  ,  j      a   i  j     s  i    t  j     |   ≤  1          subscript    i  j       subscript  a    i  j     subscript  s  i    subscript  t  j      1    \left|\sum_{i,j}a_{ij}s_{i}t_{j}\right|\leq 1     for all (real or complex) numbers s i , t j of absolute value at most 1, then       |    ∑   i  ,  j      a   i  j     ⟨   S  i   ,   T  j   ⟩     |   ≤  k          subscript    i  j       subscript  a    i  j      subscript  S  i    subscript  T  j       k    \left|\sum_{i,j}a_{ij}\langle S_{i},T_{j}\rangle\right|\leq k   ,  for all vectors  S i , T j in the unit ball  B ( H ) of a (real or complex) Hilbert space  H . The smallest constant k which satisfies this property for all n by n matrices is called a Grothendieck constant and denoted k ( n ). In fact there are two Grothendieck constants k R ( n ) and k C ( n ) for each n depending on whether one works with real or complex numbers, respectively. 1  The Grothendieck inequality and Grothendieck constants are named after Alexander Grothendieck , who proved the inequality and the existence of the constants in a paper published in 1953. 2  Bounds on the constants  The sequences k R ( n ) and k C ( n ) are easily seen to be increasing, and Grothendieck's result states that they are bounded , 3 4 so they have limits .  With k R defined to be sup n  k R ( n ) 5 then Grothendieck proved that    1.57  ≈   π  2   ≤   k   \R    ≤   sinh   (   π  2   )    ≈  2.3        1.57    π  2         subscript  k  \R          sinh    π  2         2.3     1.57\approx\frac{\pi}{2}\leq k_{\R}\leq\mathrm{sinh}(\frac{\pi}{2})\approx 2.3   .  6 improved the result by proving: 1.67696... ≤ k R ≤ 1.7822139781...=    π   2   ln   (   1  +   2    )         π    2      1    2        \frac{\pi}{2\ln(1+\sqrt{2})}   , conjecturing that the upper bound is tight. However, this conjecture was disproved by . 7  See also   Pisier–Ringrose inequality   References  External links    (NB: the historical part is not exact there.)
