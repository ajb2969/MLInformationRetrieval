Grothendieck inequality

In mathematics, the Grothendieck inequality states that there is a universal constant k with the following property. If ai,j is an n by n (real or complex) matrix with



for all (real or complex) numbers si, tj of absolute value at most 1, then


 
 ,
for all vectors Si, Tj in the unit ball B(H) of a (real or complex) Hilbert space H. The smallest constant k which satisfies this property for all n by n matrices is called a Grothendieck constant and denoted k(n). In fact there are two Grothendieck constants kR(n) and kC(n) for each n depending on whether one works with real or complex numbers, respectively.1
The Grothendieck inequality and Grothendieck constants are named after Alexander Grothendieck, who proved the inequality and the existence of the constants in a paper published in 1953.2
Bounds on the constants
The sequences kR(n) and kC(n) are easily seen to be increasing, and Grothendieck's result states that they are bounded,34 so they have limits.
With kR defined to be supn kR(n)5 then Grothendieck proved that

 , conjecturing that the upper bound is tight. However, this conjecture was disproved by .7
