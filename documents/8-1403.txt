   Pappus graph      Pappus graph   In the mathematical field of graph theory , the Pappus graph is a bipartite 3- regular  undirected graph with 18 vertices and 27 edges, formed as the Levi graph of the Pappus configuration . 1 It is named after Pappus of Alexandria , an ancient Greek mathematician who is believed to have discovered the "hexagon theorem" describing the Pappus configuration. All the cubic  distance-regular graphs are known; the Pappus graph is one of the 13 such graphs. 2  The Pappus graph has rectilinear crossing number 5, and is the smallest cubic graph with that crossing number . It has girth 6, diameter 4, radius 4, chromatic number 2, chromatic index 3 and is both 3- vertex-connected and 3- edge-connected .  The Pappus graph has a chromatic polynomial equal to     (  x  -  1  )   x   (   x  16   -  26   x  15   +  325   x  14   -  2600   x  13   +  14950   x  12   -  65762   x  11   +      fragments   fragments  normal-(  x   1  normal-)   x   fragments  normal-(   superscript  x  16    26   superscript  x  15    325   superscript  x  14    2600   superscript  x  13    14950   superscript  x  12    65762   superscript  x  11       (x-1)x(x^{16}-26x^{15}+325x^{14}-2600x^{13}+14950x^{12}-65762x^{11}+           229852   x  10    -   653966   x  9     +   1537363   x  8     -   3008720   x  7     +    4904386   x  6    -               229852   superscript  x  10      653966   superscript  x  9       1537363   superscript  x  8       3008720   superscript  x  7      limit-from    4904386   superscript  x  6        229852x^{10}-653966x^{9}+1537363x^{8}-3008720x^{7}+4904386x^{6}-       6609926   x  5   +  7238770   x  4   -  6236975   x  3   +  3989074   x  2   -  1690406  x  +  356509  )     fragments  6609926   superscript  x  5    7238770   superscript  x  4    6236975   superscript  x  3    3989074   superscript  x  2    1690406  x   356509  normal-)    6609926x^{5}+7238770x^{4}-6236975x^{3}+3989074x^{2}-1690406x+356509)   .  The name "Pappus graph" has also been used to refer to a related nine-vertex graph, 3 with a vertex for each point of the Pappus configuration and an edge for every pair of points on the same line; this nine-vertex graph is 6-regular, is the complement graph of the union of three disjoint triangle graphs , and is the complete tripartite graph K 3,3,3 . The first Pappus graph can be embedded in the torus to form a self- Petrie dual  regular map with nine hexagonal faces; the second, to form a regular map with 18 triangular faces. The two regular toroidal maps are dual to each other.  Algebraic properties  The automorphism group of the Pappus graph is a group of order 216. It acts transitively on the vertices, on the edges and on the arcs of the graph. Therefore the Pappus graph is a symmetric graph . It has automorphisms that take any vertex to any other vertex and any edge to any other edge. According to the Foster census , the Pappus graph, referenced as F018A, is the only cubic symmetric graph on 18 vertices. 4 5  The characteristic polynomial of the Pappus graph is     (   x  -  3   )    x  4    (   x  +  3   )     (    x  2   -  3   )   6         x  3    superscript  x  4     x  3    superscript     superscript  x  2   3   6     (x-3)x^{4}(x+3)(x^{2}-3)^{6}   . It is the only graph with this characteristic polynomial, making it a graph determined by its spectrum.  Gallery  Image:Pappus graph colored.svg|Pappus graph coloured to highlight various cycles.
