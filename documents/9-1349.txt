Cesàro equation

In geometry, the Cesàro equation of a plane curve is an equation relating the curvature (
 
 
 
 ) at a point of the curve to the arc length (
 
 
 
 ) from the start of the curve to the given point. It may also be given as an equation relating the radius of curvature (
 
 
 
 ) to arc length. (These are equivalent because 
 
 
 
 
 .) Two congruent curves will have the same Cesàro equation. Cesàro equations are named after Ernesto Cesàro.
Examples
Some curves have a particularly simple representation by a Cesàro equation. Some examples are:

Line

 
 .
Circle

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the radius.
Logarithmic spiral

 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  is a constant.
Circle involute

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a constant.
Cornu spiral

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a constant.
Catenary

 
 .
