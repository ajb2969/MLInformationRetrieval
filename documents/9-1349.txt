   Cesàro equation      Cesàro equation   In geometry , the Cesàro equation of a plane curve is an equation relating the curvature (   κ   κ   \kappa   ) at a point of the curve to the arc length (   s   s   s   ) from the start of the curve to the given point. It may also be given as an equation relating the radius of curvature (   R   R   R   ) to arc length . (These are equivalent because    R  =   1  /  κ       R    1  κ     R=1/\kappa   .) Two congruent curves will have the same Cesàro equation. Cesàro equations are named after Ernesto Cesàro .  Examples  Some curves have a particularly simple representation by a Cesàro equation. Some examples are:   Line     κ  =  0      κ  0    \kappa=0   .  Circle     κ  =   1  /  α       κ    1  α     \kappa=1/\alpha   , where   α   α   \alpha   is the radius.  Logarithmic spiral     κ  =   C  /  s       κ    C  s     \kappa=C/s   , where   C   C   C   is a constant.  Circle involute     κ  =   C  /   s        κ    C    s      \kappa=C/\sqrt{s}   , where   C   C   C   is a constant.  Cornu spiral     κ  =   C  s       κ    C  s     \kappa=Cs   , where   C   C   C   is a constant.  Catenary     κ  =   a    s  2   +   a  2         κ    a     superscript  s  2    superscript  a  2       \kappa=\frac{a}{s^{2}+a^{2}}   .   Related parameterizations  The Cesàro equation of a curve is related to its Whewell equation in the following way. If the Whewell equation is    φ  =   f   (  s  )        φ    f  s     \varphi=f(s)\!   then the Cesàro equation is    κ  =    f  ′    (  s  )        κ     superscript  f  normal-′   s     \kappa=f^{\prime}(s)\!   .
