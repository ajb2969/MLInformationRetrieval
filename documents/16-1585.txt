   Kuratowski–Ulam theorem      Kuratowski–Ulam theorem   In mathematics, the Kuratowski–Ulam theorem , introduced by , called also Fubini theorem for category, is an analog of the Fubini's theorem for arbitrary second countable  Baire spaces . Let X and Y be second countable  Baire spaces (or, in particular, Polish spaces ), and    A  ⊂   X  ×  Y       A    X  Y     A\subset X\times Y   . Then the following are equivalent if A has the Baire property :   A is meager (respectively comeager)  The set    {   x  ∈  X   :    A  x   is meager (resp. comeager) in  Y   }     conditional-set    x  X      subscript  A  x   is meager (resp. comeager) in  Y     \{x\in X:A_{x}\text{ is meager (resp. comeager) in }Y\}   is comeager in X, where     A  x   =    π  Y    [   A  ∩    {  x  }   ×  Y    ]         subscript  A  x      subscript  π  Y    delimited-[]    A     x   Y        A_{x}=\pi_{Y}[A\cap\{x\}\times Y]   , where    π  Y     subscript  π  Y    \pi_{Y}   is the projection onto Y.   Even if A does not have the Baire property, 2. follows from 1. 1 Note that the theorem still holds (perhaps vacuously) for X - arbitrary Hausdorff space and Y - Hausdorff with countable π-base .  The theorem is analogous to regular Fubini's theorem for the case where the considered function is a characteristic function of a set in a product space, with usual correspondences – meagre set with set of measure zero, comeagre set with one of full measure, a set with Baire property with a measurable set.
