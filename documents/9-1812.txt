   Sales (accounting)      Sales (accounting)   In bookkeeping , accounting , and finance , Net sales are operating revenues earned by a company for selling its products or rendering its services. Also referred to as revenue , they are reported directly on the income statement as Sales or Net sales .  In financial ratios that use income statement sales values, "sales" refers to net sales, not gross sales . Sales are the unique transactions that occur in professional selling or during marketing initiatives.  Revenue is earned when goods are delivered or services are rendered. 1 The term sales in a marketing , advertising or a general business context often refers to a contract in which a buyer has agreed to purchase some products at a set time in the future. From an accounting standpoint, sales do not occur until the product is delivered. "Outstanding orders" refers to sales orders that have not been filled.      General Journal       Date     7-7           7-10           A sale is a transfer of property for money or credit. 2 In double-entry bookkeeping , a sale of merchandise is recorded in the general journal as a debit to cash or accounts receivable and a credit to the sales account. 3 The amount recorded is the actual monetary value of the transaction, not the list price of the merchandise. A discount from list price might be noted if it applies to the sale.  Fees for services are recorded separately from sales of merchandise, but the bookkeeping transactions for recording "sales" of services are similar to those for recording sales of tangible goods. {{-}}  Gross sales and net sales        Net   Sales   =     Gross   Sales   -   (    Customer   Discounts   ,  Returns  ,  Allowances  )          Net  Sales       Gross  Sales      Customer  Discounts   Returns  Allowances      \mathrm{Net\ Sales}=\mathrm{Gross\ Sales}-\mathrm{(Customer\ Discounts,\ %
