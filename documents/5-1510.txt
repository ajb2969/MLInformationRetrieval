   Momentum (technical analysis)      Momentum (technical analysis)   Momentum and rate of change (ROC) are simple technical analysis indicators showing the difference between today's closing price and the close N days ago. Momentum is the absolute difference in stock, commodity:      𝑚𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑢𝑚  =    𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒  𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦   -   𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒    N    𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠   𝑎𝑔𝑜         𝑚𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑢𝑚     subscript  𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒  𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦    subscript  𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒    N  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑔𝑜       \mathit{momentum}=\mathit{close}_{\mathit{today}}-\mathit{close}_{N\,\mathit{%
 days\,ago}}     Rate of change scales by the old close, so as to represent the increase as a fraction,        𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒    𝑜𝑓   𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒   =     𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒  𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦   -   𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒    N    𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠   𝑎𝑔𝑜      𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒    N    𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠   𝑎𝑔𝑜           𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑒  𝑜𝑓  𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑒        subscript  𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒  𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦    subscript  𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒    N  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑔𝑜      subscript  𝑐𝑙𝑜𝑠𝑒    N  𝑑𝑎𝑦𝑠  𝑎𝑔𝑜       \mathit{rate\,of\,change}={\mathit{close}_{\mathit{today}}-\mathit{close}_{N\,%
 \mathit{days\,ago}}\over\mathit{close}_{N\,\mathit{days\,ago}}}     "Momentum" in general refers to prices continuing to trend. The momentum and ROC indicators show trend by remaining positive while an uptrend is sustained, or negative while a downtrend is sustained.  A crossing up through zero may be used as a signal to buy, or a crossing down through zero as a signal to sell. How high (or how low when negative) the indicators get shows how strong the trend is.  The way momentum shows an absolute change means it shows for instance a $3 rise over 20 days, whereas ROC might show that as 0.25 for a 25% rise over the same period. One can choose between looking at a move in dollar terms, relative point terms, or proportional terms. The zero crossings are the same in each, of course, but the highs or lows showing strength are on the respective different bases.  The conventional interpretation is to use momentum as a trend-following indicator. This means that when the indicator peaks and begins to descend, it can be considered a sell signal. The opposite conditions can be interpreted when the indicator bottoms out and begins to rise. 1  SMA  Momentum is the change in an N-day simple moving average (SMA) between yesterday and today, with a scale factor N+1, i.e.       𝑚𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑢𝑚   N  +  1    =    𝑆𝑀𝐴  𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦   -   𝑆𝑀𝐴  𝑦𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑦          𝑚𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑢𝑚    N  1       subscript  𝑆𝑀𝐴  𝑡𝑜𝑑𝑎𝑦    subscript  𝑆𝑀𝐴  𝑦𝑒𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑑𝑎𝑦      {\mathit{momentum}\over N+1}=\mathit{SMA}_{\mathit{today}}-\mathit{SMA}_{%
 \mathit{yesterday}}     This is the slope or steepness of the SMA line, like a derivative . This relationship is not much discussed generally, but it's of interest in understanding the signals from the indicator.  When momentum crosses up through zero it corresponds to a trough in the SMA, and when it crosses down through zero it's a peak. How high (or low) momentum gets represents how steeply the SMA is rising (or falling).  The TRIX indicator is similarly based on changes in a moving average (a triple exponential in that case).
