   Schwarz–Christoffel mapping      Schwarz–Christoffel mapping   In complex analysis , a Schwarz–Christoffel mapping is a conformal transformation of the upper half-plane onto the interior of a simple polygon . Schwarz–Christoffel mappings are used in potential theory and some of its applications, including minimal surfaces and fluid dynamics . They are named after Elwin Bruno Christoffel and Hermann Amandus Schwarz .  Definition  Consider a polygon in the complex plane. The Riemann mapping theorem implies that there is a bijective  biholomorphic mapping f from the upper half-plane      {   ζ  ∈  ℂ   :    Im  ζ   >  0   }     conditional-set    ζ  ℂ      Im  ζ   0     \{\zeta\in\mathbb{C}:\operatorname{Im}\,\zeta>0\}   to the interior of the polygon. The function f maps the real axis to the edges of the polygon. If the polygon has interior angles     α  ,  β  ,  γ  ,  …     α  β  γ  normal-…    \alpha,\beta,\gamma,\ldots   , then this mapping is given by       f   (  ζ  )    =    ∫  ζ      K     (   w  -  a   )    1  -   (   α  /  π   )       (   w  -  b   )    1  -   (   β  /  π   )       (   w  -  c   )    1  -   (   γ  /  π   )     ⋯     d  w          f  ζ     superscript   ζ       K     superscript    w  a     1    α  π      superscript    w  b     1    β  π      superscript    w  c     1    γ  π     normal-⋯    d  w      f(\zeta)=\int^{\zeta}\frac{K}{(w-a)^{1-(\alpha/\pi)}(w-b)^{1-(\beta/\pi)}(w-c)%
 ^{1-(\gamma/\pi)}\cdots}\,\mbox{d}w   where   K   K   K   is a constant , and    a  <  b  <  c  <  …        a  b       c       normal-…     a   are the values, along the real axis of the   ζ   ζ   \zeta   plane, of points corresponding to the vertices of the polygon in the   z   z   z   plane. A transformation of this form is called a Schwarz–Christoffel mapping .  It is often convenient to consider the case in which the point at infinity of the   ζ   ζ   \zeta   plane maps to one of the vertices of the   z   z   z   plane polygon (conventionally the vertex with angle   α   α   \alpha   ). If this is done, the first factor in the formula is effectively a constant and may be regarded as being absorbed into the constant   K   K   K   .  Example  Consider a semi-infinite strip in the  plane . This may be regarded as a limiting form of a triangle with vertices 0}} , π i }} , and (with real), as tends to infinity. Now    α  =  0      α  0    α=0   and    β  =  γ  =   π  /  2         β  γ         π  2      β=γ={π}/{2}   in the limit. Suppose we are looking for the mapping with  Q }} ,  P }} , and  R }} . Then is given by        f   (  ζ  )    =    ∫  ζ      K     (   w  -  1   )    1  /  2      (   w  +  1   )    1  /  2       d  w     .        f  ζ     superscript   ζ       K     superscript    w  1     1  2     superscript    w  1     1  2      d  w      f(\zeta)=\int^{\zeta}\frac{K}{(w-1)^{1/2}(w+1)^{1/2}}\,\mbox{d}w.\,     Evaluation of this integral yields       z  =   f   (  ζ  )    =   C  +   K  a  r  c  c  o  s  h  ζ          z    f  ζ          C    K  a  r  c  c  o  s  h  ζ       z=f(ζ)=C+Karccoshζ      where is a (complex) constant of integration. Requiring that  Q }} and  P }} gives 0}} and 1}} . Hence the Schwarz–Christoffel mapping is given by       z  =   a  r  c  c  o  s  h  ζ       z    a  r  c  c  o  s  h  ζ     z=arccoshζ      This transformation is sketched below.

Square  The upper half-plane is mapped to the square by       z  =   f   (  ζ  )    =    ∫  ζ     d  w     w   (    w  2   -  1   )       =     2    F   (    ζ  +  1    ;    2   /  2   )     ,        z    f  ζ          superscript   ζ       d  w       w     superscript  w  2   1                2   F       ζ  1        2   2        z=f(\zeta)=\int^{\zeta}\frac{\mbox{d}w}{\sqrt{w(w^{2}-1)}}=\sqrt{2}\,F\left(%
 \sqrt{\zeta+1};\sqrt{2}/2\right),   where F is the incomplete elliptic integral of the first kind.
