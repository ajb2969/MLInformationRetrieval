   Langlands decomposition      Langlands decomposition   In mathematics , the Langlands decomposition writes a parabolic subgroup  P of a semisimple Lie group as a product     P  =   M  A  N       P    M  A  N     P=MAN   of a reductive subgroup M , an abelian subgroup A , and a nilpotent subgroup  N .  Applications  A key application is in parabolic induction , which leads to the Langlands program : if   G   G   G   is a reductive algebraic group and    P  =   M  A  N       P    M  A  N     P=MAN   is the Langlands decomposition of a parabolic subgroup P , then parabolic induction consists of taking a representation of    M  A      M  A    MA   , extending it to   P   P   P   by letting   N   N   N   act trivially, and inducing the result from   P   P   P   to   G   G   G   .
