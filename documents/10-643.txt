   Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)      Glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)   In enzymology , a glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD(P) + ] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sn -glycerol 3-phosphate + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerone phosphate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are sn-glycerol 3-phosphate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are glycerone phosphate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn -glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD(P) + 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include L-glycerol-3-phosphate:NAD(P) + oxidoreductase , glycerol phosphate dehydrogenase (nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , (phosphate)) , glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (NADP + ) , and glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [NAD(P) + ] . This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
