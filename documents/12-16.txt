   Generalized logistic distribution      Generalized logistic distribution   The term generalized logistic distribution is used as the name for several different families of probability distributions . For example, Johnson et al. 1 list four forms, which are listed below. One family described here has also been called the skew-logistic distribution . For other families of distributions that have also been called generalized logistic distributions, see the shifted log-logistic distribution , which is a generalization of the log-logistic distribution .  Definitions  The following definitions are for standardized versions of the families, which can be expanded to the full form as a location-scale family . Each is defined using either the cumulative distribution function ( F ) or the probability density function ( ƒ ), and is defined on (-∞,∞).  Type I        F   (  x  ;  α  )    =   1    (   1  +   exp   (   -  x   )     )   α    ≡    (   1  +   exp   (   -  x   )     )    -  α     ,   α  >  0.      formulae-sequence        F   x  α      1   superscript    1      x     α          superscript    1      x       α        α  0.     F(x;\alpha)=\frac{1}{(1+\exp(-x))^{\alpha}}\equiv(1+\exp(-x))^{-\alpha},\quad%
 \alpha>0.   The corresponding probability density function is:        f   (  x  ;  α  )    =    α   exp   (   -  x   )       (   1  +   exp   (   -  x   )     )    α  +  1      ,   α  >  0.      formulae-sequence      f   x  α        α      x      superscript    1      x       α  1        α  0.     f(x;\alpha)=\frac{\alpha\exp(-x)}{\left(1+\exp(-x)\right)^{\alpha+1}},\quad%
 \alpha>0.   This type has also been called the "skew-logistic" distribution.  Type II        F   (  x  ;  α  )    =   1  -    exp   (   -   α  x    )      (   1  +   exp   (   -  x   )     )   α      ,   α  >  0.      formulae-sequence      F   x  α      1          α  x      superscript    1      x     α        α  0.     F(x;\alpha)=1-\frac{\exp(-\alpha x)}{(1+\exp(-x))^{\alpha}},\quad\alpha>0.   The corresponding probability density function is:        f   (  x  ;  α  )    =    α   (    e  x   +  2   )    e   α   (   -  x   )       (    e   -  x    +  1   )   α      e  x   +  1     ,   α  >  0.      formulae-sequence      f   x  α        α     superscript  e  x   2    superscript  e    α    x      superscript     superscript  e    x    1   α       superscript  e  x   1       α  0.     f(x;\alpha)=\frac{\alpha\left(e^{x}+2\right)e^{\alpha(-x)}\left(e^{-x}+1\right%
 )^{\alpha}}{e^{x}+1},\quad\alpha>0.     Type III        f   (  x  ;  α  )    =    1   B   (  α  ,  α  )       exp   (   -   α  x    )      (   1  +   exp   (   -  x   )     )    2  α       ,   α  >  0.      formulae-sequence      f   x  α        1    B   α  α             α  x      superscript    1      x       2  α         α  0.     f(x;\alpha)=\frac{1}{B(\alpha,\alpha)}\frac{\exp(-\alpha x)}{(1+\exp(-x))^{2%
 \alpha}},\quad\alpha>0.   Here B is the beta function . The moment generating function for this type is        f   (  x  ;  α  ,  β  )    =     1   B   (  α  ,  β  )       exp   (   -   β  x    )      (   1  +   exp   (   -  x   )     )    α  +  β      ,  α    ,   β  >  0.      formulae-sequence      f   x  α  β         1    B   α  β             β  x      superscript    1      x       α  β      α      β  0.     f(x;\alpha,\beta)=\frac{1}{B(\alpha,\beta)}\frac{\exp(-\beta x)}{(1+\exp(-x))^%
 {\alpha+\beta}},\quad\alpha,\beta>0.     Type IV  $$f(x;\alpha,\beta)=\frac{1}{B(\alpha,\beta)}\frac{\exp(-\beta x)}{(1+\exp(-x))^{\alpha+\beta}}, \quad \alpha,\beta > 0 .$$ Again, B is the beta function . The moment generating function for this type is  $$M(t)=\frac{\Gamma(\beta-t) \Gamma(\alpha+t) }{ \Gamma(\alpha) \Gamma(\beta) }, \quad -\alpha This type is also called the "exponential generalized beta of the second type". The corresponding cumulative distribution function is:
 : F(x;\alpha,\beta)= \frac{\left(e^x+1\right) \Gamma (\alpha ) e^{\beta  (-x)} \left(e^{-x}+1\right)^{-\alpha -\beta
    } \, _2\tilde{F}_1\left(1,1-\beta ;\alpha +1;-e^x\right)}{B(\alpha ,\beta )} , \quad \alpha,\beta > 0 .$$  See also   Champernowne distribution , another generalization of the logistic distribution.
