Adenylyl-sulfate reductase (glutathione)

Adenylyl-sulfate reductase (glutathione) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

AMP + sulfite + glutathione disulfide 
 
 
 
  adenylyl sulfate + 2 glutathione
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are adenosine monophosphate, sulfite, and glutathione disulfide, whereas its two products are adenylyl sulfate and glutathione.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is AMP,sulfite:glutathione-disulfide oxidoreductase (adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-forming). Other names in common use include 5'-adenylylsulfate reductase (also used for, internal_xref(ec_num(1,8,99,2))), AMP,sulfite:oxidized-glutathione oxidoreductase, (adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-forming), and plant-type 5'-adenylylsulfate reductase.
