   World Football Elo Ratings      World Football Elo Ratings   The World Soccer Elo Ratings is a ranking system for men's national teams in association football published by the website eloratings.net. The method used to rank teams is based upon the Elo rating system method but modified to take various football-specific variables into account. These ratings should not be confused with the FIFA World Rankings , which is more prevalent because it is the official rating system used by the international governing body of football to rank national teams. Also this website uses specific numbers and factors in its implementation of the general ELO-System. Other ELO rankings are of course possible, thus there is not the Elo ranking for a national team.  The ratings consider all international "A" matches for which results could be found. Ratings tend to converge on a team's true strength relative to its competitors after about 30 matches. 1 Ratings for teams with fewer than 30 matches should be considered provisional.  The FIFA Women's World Rankings system uses a modified version of the Elo formula whereas the FIFA men's ranking system uses a non-Elo formula. A 2009 comparative study of eight methods found that the implementation of the Elo rating system described below had the highest predictive capability for football matches, while the men's FIFA ranking method performed poorly. 2  Top 60 ranking  The following table shows World Football Elo Ratings on 2 August 2015, using data from the World Football Elo Ratings web site. 3  Each national team's FIFA World Rankings are shown as they were on 9 July 2015. 4       Elo Rank   Team   Points   Confederation   FIFA Rank       1    2086   UEFA   2     2    2052   CONMEBOL   1     3    2005   CONMEBOL   6     4    1988   UEFA   5     5    1984   CONMEBOL   4     6    1953   CONMEBOL   11     7    1943   UEFA   12     8    1910   UEFA   9     9    1901   UEFA   22     10    1883   UEFA   7     11    1873   UEFA   3     12    1858   CONMEBOL   13     13    1854   CONCACAF   40     14    1847   UEFA   17     15    1811   UEFA   14     16    1798   CONMEBOL   35     17    1791   CONMEBOL   46     18    1786   UEFA   27     19    1781   UEFA   33     20    1778   CONCACAF   34     21    1776   UEFA   18     22    1763   AFC   52     23    1761   UEFA   24     24    1746   CONCACAF   41     25    1745   UEFA   8     26    1740   UEFA   15     |   1732   UEFA   20      1732   CAF   21     29    1722   UEFA   15     30    1720   AFC   59         Elo Rank   Team   Points   Confederation   FIFA Rank       31    1718   UEFA   28     32    1717   AFC   38     33    1716   UEFA   30     |   1709   UEFA   26      1709   UEFA   29      1709   AFC   50     |   1694   UEFA   52      1694   UEFA   43     39    1693   UEFA   48     |   1679   CONMEBOL   56      1679   CONCACAF   62      1679   CONMEBOL   45     43    1673   UEFA   10     44    1672   CAF   19     45    1668   UEFA   23     46    1662   CAF   39     47    1653   CAF   57     48    1650   UEFA   31     49    1644   CAF   25     50    1640   AFC   69     51    1627   CAF   55     52    1623   UEFA   44     53    1617   CONMEBOL   66     |   1613   CAF   42      1613   CONCACAF   76     56    1609   UEFA   49     57    1586   UEFA   68     58    1585   UEFA   51     59    1577   UEFA   67     60    1569   CAF   32     Strongest teams since the mid to late 1960s  Time averaged Elo or Elo-like scores are routinely used to compare chess player strengths . 5 6 7 The following is a list of the national teams with the highest average Elo score from 1 January 1970 to 1 August 2015. Before this time intercontinental play was fairly limited and many nations in Africa, North America, and Asia had played too few games yet to create a representative Elo score. Since Elo scores reflect past accomplishments, the table represents the relative strength of national teams since the mid to late 1960s.

Because the Elo scores take into account past achievements with an inertia of months, the averaging over a decade is more representative of the teams' strengths for a decade starting a few years earlier and ending with the latest results of the decade relatively underweighted. For instance, this partially explains England claiming #3 spot despite missing two WCs in the 70s, boosted by results legacy from the late 60s. Or conversely the surging of France in the late 90s and Spain in the late 00s not being fully reflected in that decade but rather on the subsequent one.

In 1997 Bob Runyan adapted the Elo rating system to international football and posted the results on the Internet. He was also the first maintainer of the World Football Elo Ratings web site, now maintained by Kirill Bulygin.  Overview  The Elo system was adapted for football by adding a weighting for the kind of match, an adjustment for the home team advantage, and an adjustment for goal difference in the match result.  The factors taken into consideration when calculating a team's new rating are:   The team's old rating  The considered weight of the tournament  The goal difference of the match  The result of the match  The expected result of the match   The different weights of competitions in descending order are:   World Cup Finals  Continental championships finals and Intercontinental tournaments  World Cup and Continental championship qualifiers  All other tournaments  Friendly matches   These ratings take into account all international "A" matches for which results could be found. Ratings tend to converge on a team's true strength relative to its competitors after about 30 matches. Ratings for teams with fewer than 30 matches should be considered provisional.  Basic calculation principles  The basic principle behind the Elo ratings is only in its simplest form similar to that of a league, unlike the FIFA tables who effectively run their table as a normal league table, but with weightings to take into account the other factors, the Elo system has its one formula which takes into account the factors mentioned above. There is no first step as in the FIFA system where a team immediately receives points for the result, there is just one calculation in the Elo system.  The ratings are based on the following formulae:        R  n   =    R  o   +   K  G   (   W  -   W  e    )          subscript  R  n      subscript  R  o     K  G    W   subscript  W  e        R_{n}=R_{o}+KG(W-W_{e})       or       P  =   K  G   (   W  -   W  e    )        P    K  G    W   subscript  W  e       P=KG(W-W_{e})       Where;             R  n     subscript  R  n    R_{n}            R  o     subscript  R  o    R_{o}           K   K   K           G   G   G           W   W   W            W  e     subscript  W  e    W_{e}           P   P   P        The number of Points Change is rounded to the nearest integer before updating the team rating.  Status of match  The status of the match is incorporated by the use of a weight constant. The weight is a constant regarding the "weight" or importance of a match, defined by which tournament the match is in, they are as follows;      Tournament or Match type   Index (K)       World Cup   60     Continental Championship and Intercontinental Tournaments   50     World Cup and Continental qualifiers and major tournaments   40     All other tournaments   30     Friendly Matches   20     Number of goals  The number of goals is taken into account by use of a goal difference index. G is increased by half if a game is won by two goals, and if the game is won by three or more goals by a number decided through the appropriate calculation shown below;  If the game is a draw or is won by one goal      G  =  1      G  1    G=1     If the game is won by two goals      G  =   3  2       G    3  2     G=\frac{3}{2}     If the game is won by three or more goals   Where N is the goal difference       G  =    11  +  N   8       G      11  N   8     G=\frac{11+N}{8}     Table of examples:      Goal Difference   Coefficient of K (G)       0   1     +1   1     +2   1.5     +3   1.75     +4   1.875     +5   2     +6   2.125     +7   2.25     +8   2.375     +9   2.5     +10   2.625     Result of match  W is the result of the game (1 for a win, 0.5 for a draw, and 0 for a loss). This also holds when a game is won or lost on extra time. If the match is decided on penalties, however, the result of the game is considered a draw (W = 0.5).  Expected result of match  W e is the expected result (win expectancy with a draw counting as 0.5) from the following formula:       W  e   =   1    10   -    d  r   /  400     +  1         subscript  W  e     1     superscript  10        d  r   400     1      W_{e}=\frac{1}{10^{-dr/400}+1}     where dr equals the difference in ratings (add 100 points for the home team). So dr of 0 gives 0.5, of 120 gives 0.666 to the higher-ranked team and 0.334 to the lower, and of 800 gives 0.99 to the higher-ranked team and 0.01 to the lower.  Examples  The same examples have been used on the FIFA World Rankings for a fair comparison. Some actual examples should help to make the methods of calculation clear. In this instance it is assumed that three teams of different strengths are involved in a small friendly tournament on neutral territory.  Before the tournament the three teams have the following point totals.      Team   Points       A   630     B   500     C   480     Thus, team A is by some distance the highest ranked of the three: The following table shows the points allocations based on three possible outcomes of the match between the strongest team A, and the somewhat weaker team B:  Example 1  Team A versus Team B (Team A stronger than Team B)       Team A   Team B   Team A   Team B   Team A   Team B     Score   3 : 1   1 : 3   2 : 2        K   K   K      |20   20   20   20   20   20        G   G   G      |1.5   1.5   1.5   1.5   1   1        W   W   W      |1   0   0   1   0.5   0.5         W  e     subscript  W  e    W_{e}      |0.679   0.321   0.679   0.321   0.679   0.321     Total (P)   |+9.63   -9.63   -20.37   +20.37   -3.58   +3.58     Example 2  Team B versus Team C (both teams approximately the same strength)  When the difference in strength between the two teams is less, so also will be the difference in points allocation. The following table illustrates how the points would be divided following the same results as above, but with two roughly equally ranked teams, B and C, being involved:       Team B   Team C   Team B   Team C   Team B   Team C     Score   3 : 1   1 : 3   2 : 2        K   K   K      |20   20   20   20   20   20        G   G   G      |1.5   1.5   1.5   1.5   1   1        W   W   W      |1   0   0   1   0.5   0.5         W  e     subscript  W  e    W_{e}      |0.529   0.471   0.529   0.471   0.529   0.471     Total (P)   |+14.13   -14.13   -15.87   +15.87   -0.58   +0.58     Note that Team B loses more ranking points by losing to Team C than by losing to Team A.

Only matches between teams with at least 30 earlier matches each are included to allow a stabilized Elo rating.
