The charmed eta meson () and bottom eta meson () are forms of quarkonium ; they have the same spin and parity as the light eta but are made of charm quarks and bottom quarks respectively. The top quark is too heavy to form a similar meson, due to its very fast decay.  General  The eta was discovered in pion - nucleon collisions at the Bevatron in 1961 by A. Pevsner et al. at a time when the proposal of the Eightfold Way was leading to predictions and discoveries of new particles from symmetry considerations. 3  The difference between the mass of the η and that of the η ' is larger than the quark model can naturally explain. This " η-η' puzzle " can be resolved 4 5 6 by the 't Hooft instanton mechanism, 7 whose 1/N realization is also known as Witten-Veneziano mechanism . 8 9  Quark composition  The  particles belong to the "pseudo-scalar" nonet of mesons which have spin J = 0 and negative parity , 10 11 and  and  have zero total isospin, I , and zero strangeness and hypercharge . Each quark which appears in an  particle is accompanied by its antiquark (the particle overall is " flavourless ") and all the main quantum numbers are zero.  The basic SU(3) symmetry theory of quarks for the three lightest quarks, which only takes into account the strong force , predicts corresponding particles       η  1   =      u   u  ¯    +   d   d  ¯    +   s   s  ¯      3          subscript  η  1         normal-u   normal-¯  normal-u      normal-d   normal-¯  normal-d      normal-s   normal-¯  normal-s       3      \eta_{1}=\mathrm{\tfrac{u\bar{u}+d\bar{d}+s\bar{s}}{\sqrt{3}}}   , and       η  8   =       u   u  ¯    +   d   d  ¯     -   2  s   s  ¯      6          subscript  η  8           normal-u   normal-¯  normal-u      normal-d   normal-¯  normal-d       2  normal-s   normal-¯  normal-s       6      \eta_{8}=\mathrm{\tfrac{u\bar{u}+d\bar{d}-2s\bar{s}}{\sqrt{6}}}   .  The subscripts refer to the fact that η 1 belongs to a singlet (which is fully antisymmetrical) and η 8 is part of an octet. However in this case the weak and electromagnetic forces, which can transform one flavour of quark into another, cause a significant, though small, amount of "mixing" of the eigenstates (with mixing angle θ P = −11.5 degrees), 12 so that the actual quark composition is a linear combination of these formulae. That is:        (      cos   θ  P       -   sin   θ  P          sin   θ  P       cos   θ  P       )    (      η  8        η  1      )    =   (     η       η  ′      )              subscript  θ  normal-P         subscript  θ  normal-P          subscript  θ  normal-P       subscript  θ  normal-P         subscript  η  8      subscript  η  1        η     superscript  η  normal-′       \left(\begin{array}[]{cc}\cos\theta_{\mathrm{P}}&-\sin\theta_{\mathrm{P}}\\
 \sin\theta_{\mathrm{P}}&\cos\theta_{\mathrm{P}}\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{%
 array}[]{c}\eta_{8}\\
 \eta_{1}\end{array}\right)=\left(\begin{array}[]{c}\eta\\
 \eta^{\prime}\end{array}\right)   .  The unsubscripted name  refers to the real particle which is actually observed and which is close to the η 8 . The  is the observed particle close to η 1 . 13  The  and  particles are closely related to the better-known neutral pion , where       π  0   =      u   u  ¯    -   d   d  ¯      2          superscript  π  0         normal-u   normal-¯  normal-u      normal-d   normal-¯  normal-d       2      \pi^{0}=\mathrm{\tfrac{u\bar{u}-d\bar{d}}{\sqrt{2}}}   .  In fact π 0 , η 1 and η 8 are three mutually orthogonal linear combinations of the quark pairs u , d and s ; they are at the centre of the pseudo-scalar nonet of mesons 14 15 with all the main quantum numbers equal to zero.  Eta Prime Meson  The Eta Prime Meson is essentially a superposition of the Eta Meson, the only significant differences being a higher mass, a different decay state, and a shorter lifetime.
