   Discretization error      Discretization error   In numerical analysis , computational physics , and simulation , discretization error (or truncation error ) is the error inherent in discretization . It results from the fact that a function of a continuous variable is represented in the computer by a finite number of evaluations, for example, on a lattice . Discretization error can usually be reduced by using a more finely spaced lattice, with an increased computational cost . Whenever continuous data is discretized, there is always some amount of discretization error. The goal is to reduce the amount to a level considered negligible for the modeling purposes at hand.  Examples  Discretization error is the principal source of error in methods of finite differences and the pseudo-spectral method of computational physics.  When we define the derivative of    f   (  x  )       f  x    \,\!f(x)   as      f  ′    (  x  )    =    lim   h  →  0       f   (   x  +  h   )    -   f   (  x  )     h           superscript  f  normal-′   x     subscript    normal-→  h  0          f    x  h      f  x    h      f^{\prime}(x)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}{\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}}   or      f  ′    (  x  )    ≈     f   (   x  +  h   )    -   f   (  x  )     h          superscript  f  normal-′   x         f    x  h      f  x    h     f^{\prime}(x)\approx\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}   , where   h   h   \,\!h   is a finitely small number, the difference between the first formula and this approximation is known as discretization error.  Related phenomena  In signal processing , the analog of discretization is sampling , and results in no loss if the conditions of the sampling theorem are satisfied, otherwise the resulting error is called aliasing .  Discretization error, which arises from finite resolution in the domain, should not be confused with quantization error , which is finite resolution in the range (values), nor in round-off error arising from floating point arithmetic. Discretization error would occur even if it were possible to represent the values exactly and use exact arithmetic – it is the error from representing a function by its values at a discrete set of points, not an error in these values. 1  References  See also   Discretization  Linear multistep method  Quantization error   "  Category:Numerical analysis     ↩
