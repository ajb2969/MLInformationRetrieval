Collectionwise normal space

In mathematics, a topological space

 
  is called collectionwise normal if for every discrete family Fi (i ∈ I) of closed subsets of 
 
 
 
  there exists a pairwise disjoint family of open sets Ui (i ∈ I), such that Fi ⊂ Ui. A family 
 
 
 
  of subsets of 
 
 
 
  is called discrete when every point of 
 
 
 
  has a neighbourhood that intersects at most one of the sets from 
 
 
 
 . An equivalent definition demands that the above Ui (i ∈ I) are themselves a discrete family, which is stronger than pairwise disjoint.
Many authors assume that 
 
 
 
  is also a T1 space as part of the definition, i. e., for every pair of distinct points, each has an open neighborhood not containing the other. A collectionwise normal T1 space is a collectionwise Hausdorff space.
Every collectionwise normal space is normal (i. e., any two disjoint closed sets can be separated by neighbourhoods), and every paracompact space (i. e., every topological space in which every open cover admits a locally finite open refinement) is collectionwise normal. The property is therefore intermediate in strength between paracompactness and normality.
Every metrizable space (i. e., every topological space that is homeomorphic to a metric space) is collectionwise normal. The Moore metrisation theorem states that every collectionwise normal Moore space is metrizable.
An Fσ-set in a collectionwise normal space is also collectionwise normal in the subspace topology. In particular, this holds for closed subsets.
