Spherical mean

 In mathematics, the spherical mean of a function around a point is the average of all values of that function on a sphere of given radius centered at that point.
Definition
Consider an open set U in the Euclidean space Rn and a continuous function u defined on U with real or complex values. Let x be a point in U and r > 0 be such that the closed ball B(x, r) of center x and radius r is contained in U. The spherical mean over the sphere of radius r centered at x is defined as



where ∂B(x, r) is the (n−1)-sphere forming the boundary of B(x, r), dS denotes integration with respect to spherical measure and ωn−1(r) is the "surface area" of this (n−1)-sphere.
Equivalently, the spherical mean is given by



where ωn−1 is the area of the (n−1)-sphere of radius 1.
The spherical mean is often denoted as



The spherical mean is also defined for Riemannian manifolds in a natural manner.
Properties and uses

From the continuity of 
 
 
 
  it follows that the function

Spherical means are used in finding the solution of the wave equation

If

This result can be used to prove the maximum principle for harmonic functions.
