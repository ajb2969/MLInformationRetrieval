   Spherical mean      Spherical mean   In mathematics , the spherical mean of a function around a point is the average of all values of that function on a sphere of given radius centered at that point.  Definition  Consider an open set  U in the Euclidean space  R n and a continuous function  u defined on U with real or complex values. Let x be a point in U and r > 0 be such that the closed  ball  B ( x , r ) of center x and radius r is contained in U . The spherical mean over the sphere of radius r centered at x is defined as       1    ω   n  -  1     (  r  )        ∫    ∂  B    (  x  ,  r  )       u   (  y  )   d  S   (  y  )           1     subscript  ω    n  1    r      subscript       B    x  r       u  y  normal-d  S  y      \frac{1}{\omega_{n-1}(r)}\int\limits_{\partial B(x,r)}\!u(y)\,\mathrm{d}S(y)     where ∂ B ( x , r ) is the ( n −1)-sphere forming the boundary of B ( x , r ), d S denotes integration with respect to spherical measure and ω n −1 ( r ) is the "surface area" of this ( n −1)-sphere.  Equivalently, the spherical mean is given by       1   ω   n  -  1        ∫    ∥  y  ∥   =  1      u   (   x  +   r  y    )   d  S   (  y  )           1   subscript  ω    n  1       subscript      norm  y   1      u    x    r  y    normal-d  S  y      \frac{1}{\omega_{n-1}}\int\limits_{\|y\|=1}\!u(x+ry)\,\mathrm{d}S(y)     where ω n −1 is the area of the ( n −1)-sphere of radius 1.  The spherical mean is often denoted as         ∫    ∂  B    (  x  ,  r  )      -   u   (  y  )   d  S   (  y  )     .       subscript       B    x  r       u  y  normal-d  S  y     \int\limits_{\partial B(x,r)}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!-\,u(y)\,\mathrm{d}S(y).     The spherical mean is also defined for Riemannian manifolds in a natural manner.  Properties and uses   From the continuity of   u   u   u   it follows that the function         r  →     ∫    ∂  B    (  x  ,  r  )      -   u   (  y  )   d  S   (  y  )        normal-→  r     subscript       B    x  r       u  y  normal-d  S  y      r\to\int\limits_{\partial B(x,r)}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!-\,u(y)\,\mathrm{d}S(y)         is continuous, and its limit as    r  →  0     normal-→  r  0    r\to 0   is     u   (  x  )    .      u  x    u(x).       Spherical means are used in finding the solution of the wave equation      u   t  t    =    c  2   Δ  u        subscript  u    t  t       superscript  c  2   normal-Δ  u     u_{tt}=c^{2}\Delta u   for    t  >  0      t  0    t>0   with prescribed boundary conditions at    t  =  0.      t  0.    t=0.       If   U   U   U   is an open set in    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   and   u   u   u   is a C 2 function defined on   U   U   U   , then   u   u   u   is harmonic if and only if for all   x   x   x   in   U   U   U   and all    r  >  0      r  0    r>0   such that the closed ball    B   (  x  ,  r  )       B   x  r     B(x,r)   is contained in   U   U   U   one has           u   (  x  )    =     ∫    ∂  B    (  x  ,  r  )      -   u   (  y  )   d  S   (  y  )      .        u  x      subscript       B    x  r       u  y  normal-d  S  y      u(x)=\int\limits_{\partial B(x,r)}\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!\!-\,u(y)\,\mathrm{d}S(y).         This result can be used to prove the maximum principle for harmonic functions.   References         External links     "  Category:Partial differential equations  Category:Means
