   Tutte theorem      Tutte theorem   In the mathematical discipline of graph theory the Tutte theorem , named after William Thomas Tutte , is a characterization of graphs with perfect matchings . It is a generalization of Hall's marriage theorem from bipartite to arbitrary graphs and is a special case of the Tutte–Berge formula .  Tutte's theorem  A graph,    G  =   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G=(V,E)   , has a perfect matching  if and only if for every subset   U   U   U   of   V   V   V   , the subgraph induced by    V  −  U      V  normal-−  U    V−U   has at most  connected components with an odd number of vertices . 1  Proof  First we write the condition:         (  *  )    ∀  U    ⊆  V   ,    o   (   G  -  U   )    ≤   |  U  |       formulae-sequence       for-all  U    V       o    G  U      U      (*)\qquad\forall U\subseteq V,\quad o(G-U)\leq|U|   where    o   (  X  )       o  X    o(X)   denotes the number of odd components of the subgraph induced by   X   X   X   .  Necessity of (∗): Consider a graph   G   G   G   , with a perfect matching. Let   U   U   U   be an arbitrary subset of   V   V   V   . Delete   U   U   U   . Let   C   C   C   be an arbitrary odd component in    G  −  U      G  normal-−  U    G−U   . Since   G   G   G   had a perfect matching, at least one vertex in   C   C   C   must be matched to a vertex in   U   U   U   . Hence, each odd component has at least one vertex matched with a vertex in   U   U   U   . Since each vertex in   U   U   U   can be in this relation with at most one connected component (because of it being matched at most once in a perfect matching),    o   (   G  −  U   )    ≤   |  U  |       o    G  normal-−  U   normal-  normal-≤    U     o(G−U) ≤|U|   . 2  Sufficiency of (∗): Let   G   G   G   be an arbitrary graph satisfying (∗), and assume for a contradiction that it has no perfect matching. Consider the expansion of   G   G   G   to    G  ∗      G  normal-∗    G∗   , a maximally imperfect graph, in the sense that   G   G   G   is a spanning subgraph of    G  ∗      G  normal-∗    G∗   , but adding an edge to    G  ∗      G  normal-∗    G∗   will result in a perfect matching. We observe that    G  ∗      G  normal-∗    G∗   also satisfies condition (∗) since    G  ∗      G  normal-∗    G∗   is   G   G   G   with additional edges. Let   U   U   U   be the set of vertices of    G  ∗      G  normal-∗    G∗   of degree     |  V  |   −   1        V   normal-−  normal-  1    |V|− 1   . It can be shown through extensive case analysis that, if   U   U   U   is deleted, the remaining graph must form a disjoint union of complete graphs (each component is a complete graph). At most    |  U  |      U    |U|   of these complete graphs can be odd, so it is possible to match one vertex in each odd complete graph to a vertex in   U   U   U   , to match the remaining (evenly many) vertices in each complete graph among themselves, and to match the remaining vertices in   U   U   U   among themselves. The construction of a perfect matching in the imperfect graph    G  ∗      G  normal-∗    G∗   contradicts the assumption that   G   G   G   has no perfect matching, so it does have a perfect matching and the theorem follows. 3  See also   Bipartite matching  Hall's marriage theorem  Petersen's theorem   Notes  References      "  Category:Matching  Category:Theorems in graph theory  Category:Articles containing proofs     , p.  84; , Theorem 5.4, p. 76. ↩  , pp. 76–78. ↩
