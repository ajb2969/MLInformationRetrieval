   Beta-alanopine dehydrogenase      Beta-alanopine dehydrogenase   Beta-alanopine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   beta-alanopine + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   beta-alanine + pyruvate + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are beta-alanopine , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ion, and water , whereas its 4 products are beta-alanine , pyruvate , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and hydrogen ion .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-(D-1-carboxyethyl)-beta-alanine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (beta-alanine-forming) .
