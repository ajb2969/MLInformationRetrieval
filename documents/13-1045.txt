   Circular surface      Circular surface   In mathematics and, in particular, differential geometry a circular surface is the image of a map  ƒ : I × S 1 → R 3 , where I ⊂ R is an open interval and S 1 is the unit circle , defined by        f   (  t  ,  θ  )    :=    γ   (  t  )    +   r   (  t  )   𝕦   (  t  )    cos  θ    +   r   (  t  )   𝕧   (  t  )    sin  θ      ,     assign    f   t  θ        γ  t     r  t  𝕦  t    θ      r  t  𝕧  t    θ       f(t,\theta):=\gamma(t)+r(t){\mathbb{u}}(t)\cos\theta+r(t){\mathbb{v}}(t)\sin%

The map γ : I → R 3 is called the base curve for the circular surface and the two maps u , v : I → R 3 are called the direction frame for the circular surface. For a fixed t 0 ∈ I the image of ƒ ( t 0 , θ ) is called a generating circle of the circular surface. 1  Circular surfaces are an analogue of ruled surfaces . In the case of circular surfaces the generators are circles; called the generating circles. In the case of ruled surface the generators are straight lines; called rulings.
