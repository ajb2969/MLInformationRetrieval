Trans-feruloyl-CoA synthase




Trans-feruloyl-CoA synthase

In enzymology, a trans-feruloyl-CoA synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ferulic acid + CoASH + ATP 
 
 
 
  trans-feruloyl-CoA + products of ATP breakdown
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ferulic acid, CoASH, and ATP, whereas its two products are trans-feruloyl-CoA and products of ATP breakdown.
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is trans-ferulate:CoASH ligase (ATP-hydrolysing). This enzyme is also called trans-feruloyl-CoA synthetase.
