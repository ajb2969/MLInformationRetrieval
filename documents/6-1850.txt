   Sigma Puppis      Sigma Puppis   Sigma Puppis ( Sigma Pup , σ Puppis , σ Pup ) is a binary star system in the southern constellation of Puppis . It has an apparent visual magnitude of 3.25, 1 which is bright enough to be visible to the naked eye at night from the southern hemisphere . Through a telescope, it appears as an bright, orange-hued star with a nearby white companion. 2  Parallax measurements indicate this star is located at a distance of about  from Earth . 3  This is a spectroscopic binary system, 4 consisting of an orbiting pair of stars that have not been individually resolved with a telescope. Their orbital period is 257.8 days and the eccentricity is 0.17. 5 The pair form an eclipsing binary of the Beta Lyrae type and a period of 130.5 days, or one half of their orbital period. The eclipse of the primary component causes a decline of 0.04 magnitudes, while the secondary eclipse reduces the magnitude by 0.03. 6 7  The combined stellar classification is K5 III, 8 which matches the spectrum of a giant star . The measured angular diameter of the primary star is . 9 At the estimated distance of this system, this yields a physical size of about 107 times the radius of the Sun . 10 The primary component shows the behavior of a slow irregular variable . 11 12  In addition to its binary components, Sigma Puppis has a more distant companion that has a matching proper motion , suggesting that it may be gravitationally bound to the binary. This magnitude 8.5 13 star is at an angular separation of 22.4 arcseconds with a position angle of 74° from Sigma Puppis, which is equivalent to a projected separation of 1,200 Astronomical Units . 14 In 1970, American astronomer Olin J. Eggen suggested that Sigma Puppis belonged to a moving group of stars that share a similar motion through space, and thereby a common origin. It served as the eponym for this, the σ Puppis group. 15 The existence of this group was later brought into question. 16  References  {0.0046491\ \text{AU}/R_{\bigodot}} \\  & \approx 213.5\cdot R_{\bigodot}  \end{align} 17  18  19  20  21  22  23  }}  "  Category:Puppis (constellation)  Puppis, Sigma  Category:Stars with proper names                     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
