Corrected flow

Corrected Flow is the mass flow that would pass through a device (e.g. compressor, bypass duct, etc.) if the inlet pressure and temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at Sea Level, on a Standard Day (e.g. 14.696 lbf/in², 518.7R).
Corrected Flow, 

, can be calculated as follows, assuming Imperial Units:



Corrected Flow is often given the symbol 

 or 

 (for referred flow).
So-called Non-Dimensional Flow, 

, is proportional to Corrected Flow:



The equivalent equations for Preferred SI Units are: (101.325kPa, 288.15K)






Nomenclature:



 Stagnation (or Total) Pressure




 Stagnation (or Total) Temperature




 Real Mass Flow




 Referred Pressure




 Referred Temperature

In relative form, Corrected Flow, Referred Flow and Non-Dimensional Flow are all measures of axial Mach number.
Side note: If the mass flow can be considered an energy source such as fuel flow, the corrected flow is calculated as follows:
