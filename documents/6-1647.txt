   Corrected flow      Corrected flow   Corrected Flow is the mass flow that would pass through a device (e.g. compressor, bypass duct, etc.) if the inlet pressure and temperature corresponded to ambient conditions at Sea Level, on a Standard Day (e.g. 14.696 lbf/in², 518.7R).  Corrected Flow,      w   θ    /  δ        w    θ    δ    w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta}    , can be calculated as follows, assuming Imperial Units:        w   θ    /  δ   =    w    T  /  518.7     /   (   P  /  14.696   )            w    θ    δ       w      T  518.7       P  14.696      w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta}=w\sqrt{T/518.7}/(P/14.696)     Corrected Flow is often given the symbol     w  c      w  c    wc    or     w  r      w  r    wr    (for referred flow).  So-called Non-Dimensional Flow,      w   T    /  P        w    T    P    w\sqrt{T}/{P}    , is proportional to Corrected Flow:        w   T    /  P   =      w   θ    /  δ   *   518.7    /  14.696           w    T    P           w    θ    δ     518.7    14.696     w\sqrt{T}/{P}=w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta}*\sqrt{518.7}/{14.696}     The equivalent equations for Preferred SI Units are: (101.325kPa, 288.15K)        w   θ    /  δ   =    w    T  /  288.15     /   (   P  /  101.325   )            w    θ    δ       w      T  288.15       P  101.325      w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta}=w\sqrt{T/288.15}/(P/101.325)           w   T    /  P   =      w   θ    /  δ   *   288.15    /  101.325           w    T    P           w    θ    δ     288.15    101.325     w\sqrt{T}/{P}=w\sqrt{\theta}/{\delta}*\sqrt{288.15}/{101.325}     Nomenclature:      P   P   P    Stagnation (or Total) Pressure       T   T   T    Stagnation (or Total) Temperature       w   w   w    Real Mass Flow       δ   δ   {\delta}    Referred Pressure       θ   θ   {\theta}    Referred Temperature   In relative form, Corrected Flow, Referred Flow and Non-Dimensional Flow are all measures of axial Mach number.  Side note: If the mass flow can be considered an energy source such as fuel flow, the corrected flow is calculated as follows:      w  /   (   δ  *   θ    )       w    δ    θ      w/(\delta*\sqrt{\theta})     See also   compressor map  turbine map  corrected speed   "  Category:Turbomachinery  Category:Aerospace engineering  Category:Jet engines
