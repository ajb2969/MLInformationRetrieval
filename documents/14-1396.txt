Krein's condition

In mathematical analysis, Krein's condition provides a necessary and sufficient condition for exponential sums



to be dense in a weighted L2 space on the real line. It was discovered by Mark Krein in the 1940s.1 A corollary, also called Krein's condition, provides a sufficient condition for the indeterminacy of the moment problem.23
Statement
Let μ be an absolutely continuous measure on the real line, dμ(x) = f(x) dx. The exponential sums



are dense in L2(μ) if and only if



Indeterminacy of the moment problem
Let μ be as above; assume that all the moments



of μ are finite. If



holds, then the Hamburger moment problem for μ is indeterminate; that is, there exists another measure ν ≠ μ on R such that



This can be derived from the "only if" part of Krein's theorem above.4
Example
Let



the measure dμ(x) = f(x) dx is called the Stieltjes–Wigert measure. Since



the Hamburger moment problem for μ is indeterminate.
