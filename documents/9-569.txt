   Carleman's condition      Carleman's condition   In mathematics, particularly, in analysis , Carleman's condition gives a sufficient condition for the determinacy of the moment problem . That is, if a measure  μ satisfies Carleman's condition, there is no other measure ν having the same moments as μ . The condition was discovered by Torsten Carleman in 1922. 1  Hamburger moment problem  For the Hamburger moment problem (the moment problem on the whole real line), the theorem states the following:  Let μ be a measure on R such that all the moments        m  n   =    ∫   -  ∞    +  ∞       x  n    d  μ   (  x  )      ,   n  =   0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  ⋯       formulae-sequence     subscript  m  n     superscript   subscript                superscript  x  n   d  μ  x       n   0  1  2  normal-⋯      m_{n}=\int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}x^{n}\,d\mu(x)~{},\quad n=0,1,2,\cdots     are finite. If         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    m   2  n    -   1   2  n       =   +  ∞    ,        superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript   subscript  m    2  n        1    2  n             \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}m_{2n}^{-\frac{1}{2n}}=+\infty,     then the moment problem for m n is determinate ; that is, μ is the only measure on R with ( m n ) as its sequence of moments.  Stieltjes moment problem  For the Stieltjes moment problem , the sufficient condition for determinacy is         ∑   n  =  1   ∞    m  n   -   1   2  n       =   +  ∞    .        superscript   subscript     n  1       superscript   subscript  m  n       1    2  n             \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}m_{n}^{-\frac{1}{2n}}=+\infty.\,     Notes  References     "  Category:Mathematical analysis  Category:Probability theory  Category:Theorems in approximation theory     ↩
