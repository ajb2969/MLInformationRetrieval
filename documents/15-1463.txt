Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside 2-O-glucuronosyltransferase

Cyanidin-3-O-glucoside 2-O-glucuronosyltransferase (, BpUGT94B1, UDP-glucuronic acid:anthocyanin glucuronosyltransferase, UDP-glucuronic acid:anthocyanidin 3-glucoside 2'-O-beta-glucuronosyltransferase, BpUGAT, UDP-D-glucuronate:cyanidin-3-O-beta-glucoside 2-O-beta-glucuronosyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name UDP-D-glucuronate:cyanidin-3-O-beta-D-glucoside 2-O-beta-D-glucuronosyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-D-glucuronate + cyanidin 3-O-beta-D-glucoside 
 
 
 
  UDP + cyanidin 3-O-(2-O-beta-D-glucuronosyl)-beta-D-glucoside
 

The enzyme is highly specific for cyanidin 3-O-glucosides and UDP-D-glucuronate.
