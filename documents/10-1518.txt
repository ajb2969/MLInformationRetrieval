   Mycothione reductase      Mycothione reductase   In enzymology , a mycothione reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   mycothione + NAD(P)H + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 mycothiol + NADP +    in M. tuberculosis and other actinomycetes.  The 2 substrates of this enzyme are mycothiol and NADPH , whereas 2 molecules of mycothione and NADP + are formed as products .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is mycothiol:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called mycothiol-disulfide reductase .
