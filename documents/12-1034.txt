Hrushovski construction

In model theory, a branch of mathematical logic, the Hrushovski construction generalizes the Fraïssé limit by working with a notion of strong substructure

 
  rather than 
 
 
 
 . It can be thought of as a kind of "model-theoretic forcing", where a (usually) stable structure is created, called the generic. The specifics of 
 
 
 
  determine various properties of the generic, with its geometric properties being of particular interest. It was initially used by Ehud Hrushovski to generate a stable structure with an "exotic" geometry, thereby refuting Zil'ber's Conjecture.
Three conjectures
The initial applications of the Hrushovski construction refuted two conjectures and answered a third question in the negative. Specifically, we have:

Lachlan's Conjecture Any stable 
 
 
 
 -categorical theory is totally transcendental.


Zil'ber's Conjecture Any uncountably categorical theory is either locally modular or interprets an algebraically closed field.


Cherlin's Question Is there a maximal (with respect to expansions) strongly minimal set?

The construction
Let L be a finite relational language. Fix C a class of finite L-structures which are closed under isomorphisms and substructures. We want to strengthen the notion of substructure; let 
 
 
 
  be a relation on pairs from C satisfying:



 
  implies 
 
 
 
 .


 
  and 
 
 
 
  implies 
 
 



 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .


 
  implies 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is an isomorphism and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  extends to an isomorphism 
 
 
 
  for some superset of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .

An embedding 
 
 
 
  is strong if 
 
 
 
 .
We also want the pair (C, 
 
 
 
 ) to satisfy the amalgamation property: if 
 
 
 
  then there is a 
 
 
 
  so that each 
 
 
 
  embeds strongly into 
 
 
 
  with the same image for 
 
 
 
 .
For infinite 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , we say 
 
 
 
  iff 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . For any 
 
 
 
 , the closure of 
 
 
 
  (in 
 
 
 
 ), 
 
 
 
  is the smallest superset of 
 
 
 
  satisfying 
 
 
 
 .
'Definition A countable structure 
 
 
 
  is a (C', 
 
 
 
 )-generic if:

For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
For 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  there is a strong embedding of 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
  over 
 
 



 
  has finite closures: for every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is finite.

'''Theorem ''' If (C, 
 
 
 
 ) has the amalgamation property, then there is a unique (C, 
 
 
 
 )-generic.
The existence proof proceeds in imitation of the existence proof for Fraïssé limits. The uniqueness proof comes from an easy back and forth argument.
