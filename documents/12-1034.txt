   Hrushovski construction      Hrushovski construction   In model theory , a branch of mathematical logic , the Hrushovski construction generalizes the Fraïssé limit by working with a notion of strong substructure    ≤     \leq   rather than   ⊆     \subseteq   . It can be thought of as a kind of "model-theoretic forcing", where a (usually) stable structure is created, called the generic . The specifics of   ≤     \leq   determine various properties of the generic, with its geometric properties being of particular interest. It was initially used by Ehud Hrushovski to generate a stable structure with an "exotic" geometry, thereby refuting Zil'ber's Conjecture.  Three conjectures  The initial applications of the Hrushovski construction refuted two conjectures and answered a third question in the negative. Specifically, we have:   Lachlan's Conjecture Any stable    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   -categorical theory is totally transcendental.    Zil'ber's Conjecture Any uncountably categorical theory is either locally modular or interprets an algebraically closed field.    Cherlin's Question Is there a maximal (with respect to expansions) strongly minimal set?   The construction  Let L be a finite relational language. Fix C a class of finite  L -structures which are closed under isomorphisms and substructures. We want to strengthen the notion of substructure; let   ≤     \leq   be a relation on pairs from C satisfying:       A  ≤  B      A  B    A\leq B   implies    A  ⊆  B      A  B    A\subseteq B   .      A  ⊆  B  ⊆  C        A  B       C     A\subseteq B\subseteq C   and    A  ≤  C      A  C    A\leq C   implies    A  ≤  B      A  B    A\leq B         ∅  ≤  A       A    \varnothing\leq A   for all    A  ∈   \C       A  \C    A\in\C   .      A  ≤  B      A  B    A\leq B   implies     A  ∩  C   ≤   B  ∩  C         A  C     B  C     A\cap C\leq B\cap C   for all    C  ∈   \C       C  \C    C\in\C   .  If    f  :   A  →   A  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  A   superscript  A  normal-′      f:A\rightarrow A^{\prime}   is an isomorphism and    A  ≤  B      A  B    A\leq B   , then   f   f   f   extends to an isomorphism    B  →   B  ′      normal-→  B   superscript  B  normal-′     B\rightarrow B^{\prime}   for some superset of   B   B   B   with     A  ′   ≤   B  ′        superscript  A  normal-′    superscript  B  normal-′     A^{\prime}\leq B^{\prime}   .   An embedding    f  :   A  ↪  D      normal-:  f   normal-↪  A  D     f:A\hookrightarrow D   is strong if     f   (  A  )    ≤  D        f  A   D    f(A)\leq D   .  We also want the pair ( C ,   ≤     \leq   ) to satisfy the amalgamation property : if     A  ≤   B  1    ,   A  ≤   B  2       formulae-sequence    A   subscript  B  1      A   subscript  B  2      A\leq B_{1},A\leq B_{2}   then there is a    D  ∈   \C       D  \C    D\in\C   so that each    B  i     subscript  B  i    B_{i}   embeds strongly into   D   D   D   with the same image for   A   A   A   .  For infinite   D   D   D   , and    A  ∈   \C       A  \C    A\in\C   , we say    A  ≤  D      A  D    A\leq D   iff    A  ≤  X      A  X    A\leq X   for    A  ⊆  X  ⊆  D        A  X       D     A\subseteq X\subseteq D   ,    X  ∈   \C       X  \C    X\in\C   . For any    A  ⊆  D      A  D    A\subseteq D   , the closure of   A   A   A   (in   D   D   D   ),     cl  D    (  A  )       subscript  cl  D   A    \operatorname{cl}_{D}(A)   is the smallest superset of   A   A   A   satisfying     cl   (  A  )    ≤  D       cl  A   D    \operatorname{cl}(A)\leq D   .  'Definition A countable structure   G   G   G   is a ( C ',   ≤     \leq   )-generic if:   For    A   ⊆  ω   G      subscript   ω   A  G    A\subseteq_{\omega}G   ,    A  ∈   \C       A  \C    A\in\C   .  For    A  ≤  G      A  G    A\leq G   , if    A  ≤  B      A  B    A\leq B   then   B   B   B   there is a strong embedding of   B   B   B   into   G   G   G   over   A   A   A        G   G   G   has finite closures: for every    A   ⊆  ω   G      subscript   ω   A  G    A\subseteq_{\omega}G   ,     cl  G    (  A  )       subscript  cl  G   A    \operatorname{cl}_{G}(A)   is finite.   '''Theorem ''' If ( C ,   ≤     \leq   ) has the amalgamation property, then there is a unique ( C ,   ≤     \leq   )-generic.  The existence proof proceeds in imitation of the existence proof for Fraïssé limits. The uniqueness proof comes from an easy back and forth argument.  References   E. Hrushovski.
