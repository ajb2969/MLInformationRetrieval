   Rankine–Hugoniot conditions      Rankine–Hugoniot conditions   The Rankine–Hugoniot conditions , also referred to as Rankine–Hugoniot jump conditions or Rankine–Hugoniot relations , describe the relationship between the states on both sides of a shock wave in a one-dimensional flow in fluids or a one-dimensional deformation in solids. They are named in recognition of the work carried out by Scottish engineer and physicist William John Macquorn Rankine 1 and French engineer Pierre Henri Hugoniot . 2 See also Salas (2006) 3 for some historical background.  In a coordinate system that is moving with the shock, the Rankine–Hugoniot conditions can be expressed as:         ρ  1     u  s    =    ρ  2    (    u  s   -   u  2    )           subscript  ρ  1    subscript  u  s       subscript  ρ  2      subscript  u  s    subscript  u  2       \displaystyle\rho_{1}\,u_{s}=\rho_{2}(u_{s}-u_{2})   where u s is the shock wave speed, ρ 1 and ρ 2 are the mass density of the fluid behind and inside the shock, u 2 is the particle velocity of the fluid inside the shock, p 1 and p 2 are the pressures in the two regions, and e 1 and e 2 are the specific (with the sense of per unit mass ) internal energies in the two regions. These equations can be derived in a straightforward manner from equations (12), (13) and (14) below. Using the Rankine-Hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum to eliminate u s and u 2 , the equation for the conservation of energy can be expressed as the Hugoniot equation :        e  2   -   e  1    =      1  2      (    p  2   +   p  1    )    (    v  1   -   v  2    )           subscript  e  2    subscript  e  1        1  2      subscript  p  2    subscript  p  1       subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2       e_{2}-e_{1}=\tfrac{1}{2}\,(p_{2}+p_{1})\,(v_{1}-v_{2})   where v 1 and v 2 are the uncompressed and compressed specific volumes per unit mass, respectively.  Basics: Euler equations in one dimension  Consider gas in a one-dimensional container (e.g., a long thin tube). Assume that the fluid is inviscid (i.e., it shows no viscosity effects as for example friction with the tube walls). Furthermore, assume that there is no heat transfer by conduction or radiation and that gravitational acceleration can be neglected. Such a system can be described by the following system of conservation laws , known as the 1D Euler equations , that in conservation form is:          (  1  )      ∂  ρ    ∂  t      =   -    ∂   ∂  x     (   ρ  u   )          1      ρ     t              x      ρ  u       (\;1)\quad\quad\frac{\partial\rho}{\partial t}\;\;=-\frac{\partial}{\partial x%

This quantity also appears as the polytropic exponent of the polytropic process described by           (  5  )    p   ρ  γ     =  constant   .       5    p   superscript  ρ  γ     constant    (\;5)\quad\quad\frac{p}{\rho^{\gamma}}=\text{constant}.        For an extensive list of compressible flow equations, etc., refer to NACA Report 1135 (1953). 4  Note: For a calorically ideal gas    γ    γ   \gamma\,   is a constant and for a thermally ideal gas    γ    γ   \gamma\,   is a function of temperature. In the latter case, the dependence of pressure on mass density and internal energy might differ from that given by equation (4).  The jump condition  Before proceeding further it is necessary to introduce the concept of a jump condition – a condition that holds at a discontinuity or abrupt change.  Consider a 1D situation where there is a jump in the scalar conserved physical quantity   w   w   w   , which is governed by integral conservation law    (\;6) \quad\quad\frac{d}{dt}     \int_{x_1}^{x_2}w \, dx = -\left.f\left(w\right)\right|_{x_1}^{x_2} for any    x  1     subscript  x  1    x_{1}   ,    x  2     subscript  x  2    x_{2}   ,    x  =    x  s    (  t  )        x     subscript  x  s   t     x=x_{s}(t)   for smooth solutions. 5  Let the solution exhibit a jump (or shock) at     (  8  )   ∴   w  1     d   x  s     d  t    -   w  2     d   x  s     d  t    +   ∫   x  1     x  s    (  t  )       w  t    d  x  +   ∫    x  s    (  t  )     x  2      w  t    d  x  =  -  f   (  w  )    |   x  1    x  2       fragments   fragments  normal-(  8  normal-)   italic-  therefore   subscript  w  1       d   subscript  x  s      d  t      subscript  w  2       d   subscript  x  s      d  t      superscript   subscript    subscript  x  1       subscript  x  s   t     subscript  w  t   d  x    superscript   subscript      subscript  x  s   t     subscript  x  2     subscript  w  t   d  x    f   fragments  normal-(  w  normal-)    superscript   subscript  normal-|   subscript  x  1     subscript  x  2      (\;8)\quad\quad\therefore w_{1}\frac{dx_{s}}{dt}-w_{2}\frac{dx_{s}}{dt}+\int_{%

Note, to arrive at equation (8) we have used the fact that     x  1   →     x  s    (  t  )    -  ϵ      normal-→   subscript  x  1        subscript  x  s   t   ϵ     x_{1}\rightarrow x_{s}(t)-\epsilon   and     x  2   →     x  s    (  t  )    +  ϵ      normal-→   subscript  x  2        subscript  x  s   t   ϵ     x_{2}\rightarrow x_{s}(t)+\epsilon   .

A shock situation arises in a system where its characteristics intersect, and under these conditions a requirement for a unique single-valued solution is that the solution should satisfy the admissibility condition or entropy condition .

Euler equations shock condition  In the case of the hyperbolic conservation law (6), we have seen that the shock speed can be obtained by simple division.

Instead, experimental observations 11 indicate that a linear relation can be used instead (called the shock Hugoniot in the u s - u p plane) that has the form        (  25  )     p  2   -   p  1     =    u  s  2    (    ρ  1   -    ρ  1  2    ρ  2     )         25     subscript  p  2    subscript  p  1        superscript   subscript  u  s   2      subscript  ρ  1      superscript   subscript  ρ  1   2    subscript  ρ  2        (25)\qquad p_{2}-p_{1}=u_{s}^{2}\left(\rho_{1}-\frac{\rho_{1}^{2}}{\rho_{2}}%
 \right)\,   where c 0 is the bulk speed of sound in the material (in uniaxial compression), s is a parameter (the slope of the shock Hugoniot) obtained from fits to experimental data, and u p = u 2 is the particle velocity inside the compressed region behind the shock front.  The above relation, when combined with the Hugoniot equations for the conservation of mass and momentum, can be used to determine the shock Hugoniot in the p - v plane, where v is the specific volume (per unit mass): 12      (  6  )    6   \scriptstyle(6)   Alternative equations of state, such as the Mie–Gruneisen equation of state may also be used instead of the above equation.  The shock Hugoniot describes the locus of all possible thermodynamic states a material can exist in behind a shock, projected onto a two dimensional state-state plane. It is therefore a set of equilibrium states and does not specifically represent the path through which a material undergoes transformation.  Weak shocks are isentropic and that the isentrope represents the path through which the material is loaded from the initial to final states by a compression wave with converging characteristics. In the case of weak shocks, the Hugoniot will therefore fall directly on the isentrope and can be used directly as the equivalent path. In the case of a strong shock we can no longer make that simplification directly. However, for engineering calculations, it is deemed that the isentrope is close enough to the Hugoniot that the same assumption can be made.  If the Hugoniot is approximately the loading path between states for an "equivalent" compression wave, then the jump conditions for the shock loading path can be determined by drawing a straight line between the initial and final states. This line is called the Rayleigh line and has the following equation:      (   6  ′   )     superscript  6  normal-′    \scriptstyle(6^{\prime})     Hugoniot elastic limit  Most solid materials undergo plastic deformations when subjected to strong shocks. The point on the shock Hugoniot at which a material transitions from a purely elastic state to an elastic-plastic state is called the Hugoniot elastic limit (HEL) and the pressure at which this transition takes place is denoted p HEL . Values of p HEL can range from 0.2 GPa to 20 GPa. Above the HEL, the material loses much of its shear strength and starts behaving like a fluid.
