Polymatroid

In mathematics, polymatroid is a polytope associated with a submodular function. The notion was introduced by Jack Edmonds in 1970.1
Definition
Consider any submodular set function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . Then define two associated polyhedra.








Here 
 
 
 
  is called the polymatroid and 
 
 
 
  is called the extended polymatroid associated with

Properties



 
  is nonempty if and only if 
 
 
 
  and that 
 
 
 
  is nonempty if and only if 
 
 

Given any extended polymatroid 
 
 
 
  there is a unique submodular function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 

If f is integer-valued, 1-Lipschitz, and 
 
 
 
  then f is the rank-function of a matroid, and the polymatroid is the independent set polytope, so-called since Edmonds showed it is the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all independent sets of the matroid.
For a supermodular f one analogously may define the contrapolymatroid






This analogously generalizes the dominant of the spanning set polytope of matroids.
