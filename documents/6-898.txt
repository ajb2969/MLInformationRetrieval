   Polymatroid      Polymatroid   In mathematics, polymatroid is a polytope associated with a submodular function . The notion was introduced by Jack Edmonds in 1970. 1  Definition  Consider any submodular set function   f   f   f   on   E   E   E   . Then define two associated polyhedra.        E   P  f    :=   {   x  ∈   ℝ  E    |      ∑   e  ∈  U     x   (  e  )     ≤   f   (  U  )     ,    ∀  U   ⊆  E    }      assign    E   subscript  P  f     conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  E     formulae-sequence      subscript     e  U      x  e      f  U       for-all  U   E       EP_{f}:=\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{E}|\sum_{e\in U}x(e)\leq f(U),\forall U\subseteq E\}          P  f   :=    E   P  f    ∩   {   x  ∈   ℝ  E    |   x  ≥  0   }       assign   subscript  P  f       E   subscript  P  f     conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  E      x  0       P_{f}:=EP_{f}\cap\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{E}|x\geq 0\}      Here    P  f     subscript  P  f    P_{f}   is called the polymatroid and    E   P  f       E   subscript  P  f     EP_{f}   is called the extended polymatroid associated with   f   f   f   . 2  Properties       P  f     subscript  P  f    P_{f}   is nonempty if and only if    f  ≥  0      f  0    f\geq 0   and that    E   P  f       E   subscript  P  f     EP_{f}   is nonempty if and only if     f   (  ∅  )    ≥  0        f    0    f(\emptyset)\geq 0     Given any extended polymatroid    E  P      E  P    EP   there is a unique submodular function   f   f   f   such that     f   (  ∅  )    =  0        f    0    f(\emptyset)=0   and     E   P  f    =   E  P         E   subscript  P  f      E  P     EP_{f}=EP     If f is integer-valued, 1-Lipschitz , and     f   (  ∅  )    =  0        f    0    f(\emptyset)=0   then f is the rank-function of a matroid , and the polymatroid is the independent set polytope, so-called since Edmonds showed it is the convex hull of the characteristic vectors of all independent sets of the matroid.  For a supermodular  f one analogously may define the contrapolymatroid          w  ∈   ℝ  +  E    :     ∀  S   ⊆  E   ,     ∑   e  ∈  S     w   (  e  )     ≥   f   (  S  )         normal-:    w   superscript   subscript  ℝ    E     formulae-sequence     for-all  S   E       subscript     e  S      w  e      f  S       w\in\mathbb{R}_{+}^{E}:\forall S\subseteq E,\sum_{e\in S}w(e)\geq f(S)     This analogously generalizes the dominant of the spanning set  polytope of matroids.
