ADP—thymidine kinase




ADP—thymidine kinase

In enzymology, an ADP—thymidine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ADP + thymidine 
 
 
 
  AMP + thymidine 5'-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP and thymidine, whereas its two products are AMP and thymidine 5'-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP:thymidine 5'-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include ADP:dThd phosphotransferase, and adenosine diphosphate-thymidine phosphotransferase.
