CASA ratio of a bank is the ratio of deposits in current and saving accounts to total deposits. A higher CASA ratio indicates a lower cost of funds, because banks do not usually give any interests on current account deposits and the interest on saving accounts is usually very low 3-4%. 7 If a large part of a bank's deposits comes from these funds, it means that the bank is getting those funds at a relative lower cost. It is generally understood that a higher CASA ratio leads to higher net interest margin. In India , it is used as one of the metrics to assess the profitability of a bank. 8 9  Formula       C  A  S  A  R  a  t  i  o   =   (    C  A  S  A  D  e  p  o  s  i  t  s    T  o  t  a  l  D  e  p  o  s  i  t  s    )         C  A  S  A  R  a  t  i  o       C  A  S  A  D  e  p  o  s  i  t  s     T  o  t  a  l  D  e  p  o  s  i  t  s      {CASARatio}=\left(\frac{CASADeposits}{TotalDeposits}\right)     See also   Banking in India   References  Further reading      "  Category:Financial ratios     ↩      ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
