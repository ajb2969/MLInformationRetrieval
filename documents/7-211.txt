Euler's theorem in geometry

In geometry, Euler's theorem states that the distance d between the circumcentre and incentre of a triangle can be expressed as1234



or equivalently



where R and r denote the circumradius and inradius respectively (the radii of the circumscribed circle and inscribed circle respectively). The theorem is named for Leonhard Euler, who published it in 1767.5 However, the same result was published earlier by William Chapple in 1746.6
From the theorem follows the Euler inequality:78



which holds with equality only in the equilateral case.9
Proof
 Letting O be the circumcentre of triangle ABC, and I be its incentre, the extension of AI intersects the circumcircle at L. Then L is the midpoint of arc BC. Join LO and extend it so that it intersects the circumcircle at M. From I construct a perpendicular to AB, and let D be its foot, so ID = r. It is not difficult to prove that triangle ADI is similar to triangle MBL, so ID / BL = AI / ML, i.e. ID × ML = AI × BL. Therefore 2Rr = AI × BL. Join BI. Because

∠ BIL = ∠ A / 2 + ∠ ABC / 2,
 


∠ IBL = ∠ ABC / 2 + ∠ CBL = ∠ ABC / 2 + ∠ A / 2,
 

we have ∠ BIL = ∠ IBL, so BL = IL, and AI × IL = 2Rr. Extend OI so that it intersects the circumcircle at P and Q; then PI × QI = AI × IL = 2Rr, so (R + d)(R − d) = 2Rr, i.e. d2 = R(R − 2r).
