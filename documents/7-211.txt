   Euler's theorem in geometry      Euler's theorem in geometry   In geometry , Euler's theorem states that the distance d between the circumcentre and incentre of a triangle can be expressed as 1 2 3 4       d  2   =   R   (   R  -   2  r    )         superscript  d  2     R    R    2  r       d^{2}=R(R-2r)\,     or equivalently         1   R  -  d    +   1   R  +  d     =   1  r    ,          1    R  d      1    R  d       1  r     \frac{1}{R-d}+\frac{1}{R+d}=\frac{1}{r},     where R and r denote the circumradius and inradius respectively (the radii of the circumscribed circle and inscribed circle respectively). The theorem is named for Leonhard Euler , who published it in 1767. 5 However, the same result was published earlier by William Chapple in 1746. 6  From the theorem follows the Euler inequality : 7 8       R  ≥   2  r    ,      R    2  r     R\geq 2r,     which holds with equality only in the equilateral case. 9  Proof  Letting O be the circumcentre of triangle ABC , and I be its incentre, the extension of AI intersects the circumcircle at L . Then L is the midpoint of arc BC . Join LO and extend it so that it intersects the circumcircle at M . From I construct a perpendicular to AB, and let D be its foot, so ID = r . It is not difficult to prove that triangle ADI is similar to triangle MBL , so ID / BL = AI / ML , i.e. ID × ML = AI × BL . Therefore 2 Rr = AI × BL . Join BI . Because   ∠ BIL = ∠ A / 2 + ∠ ABC / 2,    ∠ IBL = ∠ ABC / 2 + ∠ CBL = ∠ ABC / 2 + ∠ A / 2,   we have ∠ BIL = ∠ IBL , so BL = IL , and AI × IL = 2 Rr . Extend OI so that it intersects the circumcircle at P and Q ; then PI × QI = AI × IL = 2 Rr , so ( R + d )( R − d ) = 2 Rr , i.e. d 2 = R ( R − 2 r ).  Stronger version of the inequality  A stronger version 10 is       R  r   ≥     a  b  c   +   a  3   +   b  3   +   c  3     2  a  b  c    ≥     a  b   +   b  c   +   c  a    -  1   ≥    2  3    (    a  b   +   b  c   +   c  a    )    ≥  2.
