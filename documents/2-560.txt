   Weighted average cost of capital      Weighted average cost of capital   The weighted average cost of capital ( WACC ) is the rate that a company is expected to pay on average to all its security holders to finance its assets. The WACC is commonly referred to as the firm’s cost of capital . Importantly, it is not dictated by management. Rather, it represents the minimum return that a company must earn on an existing asset base to satisfy its creditors, owners, and other providers of capital, or they will invest elsewhere. 1  Companies raise money from a number of sources: common stock , preferred stock , straight debt , convertible debt , exchangeable debt , warrants , options , pension liabilities , executive stock options , governmental subsidies, and so on. Different securities, which represent different sources of finance, are expected to generate different returns. The WACC is calculated taking into account the relative weights of each component of the capital structure . The more complex the company's capital structure, the more laborious it is to calculate the WACC.  Companies can use WACC to see if the investment projects available to them are worthwhile to undertake. 2  Calculation  In general, the WACC can be calculated with the following formula: 3     WACC  =      ∑   i  =  1   N       r  i   ⋅  M    V  i        ∑   i  =  1   N     M   V  i          WACC      superscript   subscript     i  1    N      normal-⋅   subscript  r  i   M    subscript  V  i       superscript   subscript     i  1    N     M   subscript  V  i        \text{WACC}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}r_{i}\cdot MV_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{N}MV_{i}}     where   N   N   N   is the number of sources of capital (securities, types of liabilities);    r  i     subscript  r  i    r_{i}   is the required rate of return for security   i   i   i   ; and    M   V  i       M   subscript  V  i     MV_{i}   is the market value of all outstanding securities   i   i   i   .  In the case where the company is financed with only equity and debt, the average cost of capital is computed as follows:      WACC  =     D   D  +  E     K  d    +    E   D  +  E     K  e         WACC        D    D  E     subscript  K  d        E    D  E     subscript  K  e       \text{WACC}=\frac{D}{D+E}K_{d}+\frac{E}{D+E}K_{e}     where D is the total debt, E is the total shareholder’s equity, Ke is the cost of equity , and Kd is the cost of debt . The market values of debt and equity should be used when computing the weights in the WACC formula. 4  Tax effects  Tax effects can be incorporated into this formula. For example, the WACC for a company financed by one type of shares with the total market value of    M   V  e       M   subscript  V  e     MV_{e}   and cost of equity    R  e     subscript  R  e    R_{e}   and one type of bonds with the total market value of    M   V  d       M   subscript  V  d     MV_{d}   and cost of debt    R  d     subscript  R  d    R_{d}   , in a country with corporate tax rate   t   t   t   , is calculated as:      WACC  =      M   V  e      M   V  d    +   M   V  e      ⋅   R  e    +     M   V  d      M   V  d    +   M   V  e      ⋅   R  d   ⋅   (   1  -  t   )         WACC     normal-⋅      M   subscript  V  e        M   subscript  V  d      M   subscript  V  e       subscript  R  e     normal-⋅      M   subscript  V  d        M   subscript  V  d      M   subscript  V  e       subscript  R  d     1  t       \text{WACC}=\frac{MV_{e}}{MV_{d}+MV_{e}}\cdot R_{e}+\frac{MV_{d}}{MV_{d}+MV_{e%
 }}\cdot R_{d}\cdot(1-t)     Actually carrying out this calculation has a problem. There are many plausible proxies for each element. As a result, a fairly wide range of values for the WACC for a given firm in a given year, may appear defensible. 5  See also   Beta coefficient  Cost of capital  Discounted cash flow  Economic Value Added  Internal rate of return  Minimum acceptable rate of return  Modigliani-Miller theorem  Net present value  Opportunity cost   References  External links   Video about practical application of the WACC approach     A rather complete WACC calculator  Another very basic WACC calculator  A more realistic valuation: APV and WACC with constant book leverage ratio  Calculate the WACC with your own values to understand the equation  Find the WACC of any publicly traded company by entering the firm's stock ticker symbol  Paper describing a method for generating the WACC curve when there is default risk – spreadsheet available  Tutorial how to calculate WACC in Excel.
