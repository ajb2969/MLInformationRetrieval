   Derived algebraic geometry      Derived algebraic geometry   Derived algebraic geometry is a branch of mathematics that generalizes algebraic geometry to a situation where commutative rings , which provide a local chart, are replaced by ring spectra in algebraic topology , whose higher homotopy accounts for the non-commutativity of the structure sheaf. Grothendieck's scheme theory allows the structure sheaf to carry nilpotent elements . Derived algebraic geometry can be thought of as an extension of this, and provides a natural setting for cotangent complexes and such in deformation theory (cf. F. Francis).  Basic objects of study in the field are derived schemes and derived stacks .
