   Reflection theorem      Reflection theorem    For reflection principles in set theory, see reflection principle .    In algebraic number theory , a reflection theorem or Spiegelungssatz ( German for reflection theorem – see Spiegel and Satz ) is one of a collection of theorems linking the sizes of different ideal class groups (or ray class groups ), or the sizes of different isotypic components of a class group. The original example is due to Ernst Eduard Kummer , who showed that the class number of the cyclotomic field     ℚ   (   ζ  p   )       ℚ   subscript  ζ  p     \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{p}\right)   , with p a prime number, will be divisible by p if the class number of the maximal real subfield    ℚ    (   ζ  p   )   +       ℚ   superscript   subscript  ζ  p       \mathbb{Q}\left(\zeta_{p}\right)^{+}   is. Another example is due to Scholz. 1 A simplified version of his theorem states that if 3 divides the class number of a real quadratic field     ℚ   (   d   )       ℚ    d     \mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{d}\right)   , then 3 also divides the class number of the imaginary quadratic field     ℚ   (    -   3  d     )       ℚ        3  d       \mathbb{Q}\left(\sqrt{-3d}\right)   .  Leopoldt's Spiegelungssatz  Both of the above results are generalized by Leopoldt 's "Spiegelungssatz", which relates the p-ranks of different isotypic components of the class group of a number field considered as a module over the Galois group of a Galois extension.  Let L / K be a finite Galois extension of number fields, with group G , degree prime to p and L containing the p -th roots of unity. Let A be the p -Sylow subgroup of the class group of L . Let φ run over the irreducible characters of the group ring Q p [ G ] and let A φ denote the corresponding direct summands of A . For any φ let q = p φ(1) and let the G -rank e φ be the exponent in the index       [   A  ϕ   :   A  ϕ  p   ]   =   q   e  ϕ    .     fragments   fragments  normal-[   subscript  A  ϕ   normal-:   superscript   subscript  A  ϕ   p   normal-]     superscript  q   subscript  e  ϕ    normal-.    [A_{\phi}:A_{\phi}^{p}]=q^{e_{\phi}}.     Let ω be the character of G        ζ  g   =    ζ   ω   (  g  )     for  ζ   ∈   μ  p    .         superscript  ζ  g      superscript  ζ    ω  g    for  ζ         subscript  μ  p      \zeta^{g}=\zeta^{\omega(g)}\text{ for }\zeta\in\mu_{p}.     The reflection ( Spiegelung ) φ * is defined by         ϕ  *    (  g  )    =   ω   (  g  )   ϕ   (   g   -  1    )     .         superscript  ϕ    g     ω  g  ϕ   superscript  g    1       \phi^{*}(g)=\omega(g)\phi(g^{-1}).     Let E be the unit group of K . We say that ε is "primary" if     K   (   ϵ  p   )    /  K        K     p   ϵ    K    K(\sqrt[p]{\epsilon})/K   is unramified, and let E 0 denote the group of primary units modulo E p . Let δ φ denote the G -rank of the φ component of E 0 .  The Spiegelungssatz states that        |    e   ϕ  *    -   e  ϕ    |   ≤   δ  ϕ    .           subscript  e   superscript  ϕ      subscript  e  ϕ      subscript  δ  ϕ     |e_{\phi^{*}}-e_{\phi}|\leq\delta_{\phi}.     Extensions  Extensions of this Spiegelungssatz were given by Oriat and Oriat-Satge, where class groups were no longer associated with characters of the Galois group of K / k , but rather by ideals in a group ring over the Galois group of K / k . Leopoldt's Spiegelungssatz was generalized in a different direction by Kuroda, who extended it to a statement about ray class groups . This was further developed into the very general " T - S reflection theorem" of Georges Gras . 2  Kenkichi Iwasawa also provided an Iwasawa-theoretic reflection theorem.
