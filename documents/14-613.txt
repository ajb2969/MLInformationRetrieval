Truncus (mathematics)

In analytic geometry, a truncus is a curve in the Cartesian plane consisting of all points (x,y) satisfying an equation of the form

where a, b, and c are given constants. The two asymptotes of a truncus are parallel to the coordinate axes. The basic truncus y = 1 / x2 has asymptotes at x = 0 and y = 0, and every other truncus can be obtained from this one through a combination of translations and dilations.
For the general truncus form above, the constant a dilates the graph by a factor of a from the x-axis; that is, the graph is stretched vertically when a > 1 and compressed vertically when 0  0, or right when b  0 or down when c
