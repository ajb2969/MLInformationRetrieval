   Isoeugenol synthase      Isoeugenol synthase   Isoeugenol synthase (, IGS1 , t-anol/isoeugenol synthase 1 ) is an enzyme with system name eugenol:NADP + oxidoreductase (coniferyl acetate reducing) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction . 4   isoeugenol + acetate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    coniferyl acetate + NADPH + H +    The enzyme acts in the reverse direction.
