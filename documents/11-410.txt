   3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphatase      3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphatase   In enzymology , a 3-deoxy-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate 8-phosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-deoxy-D-manno-octulosonate-8-phosphate 8-phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis .
