   Fall time      Fall time   In electronics , fall time ( pulse decay time )     t  f      subscript  t  f    \scriptstyle t_{f}\,   is the time taken for the amplitude of a pulse to decrease (fall) from a specified value (usually 90% of the peak value exclusive of overshoot or undershoot) to another specified value (usually 10% of the maximum value exclusive of overshoot or undershoot).  Limits on undershoot and oscillation (also known as ringing and hunting) are sometimes additionally stated when specifying fall time limits.
