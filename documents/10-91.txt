   Technetium (99mTc) albumin aggregated      Technetium (99mTc) albumin aggregated   Technetium 99m Tc albumin aggregated ( 99m Tc-MAA) is an injectable radiopharmaceutical used in nuclear medicine . It consists of a sterile aqueous suspension of Technetium-99m ( 99m Tc) labeled to human albumin aggregate particles in the pH range of 3.8 to 8.0.  Preparation  Kits for preparing 99m Tc-MAA are available in the United States from only a single manufacturer; Draximage. The kits are delivered to nuclear pharmacies as lyophilized powders of non-radioactive ingredients sealed under nitrogen. A nuclear pharmacist adds anywhere from 50 - 100 mCi of Na 99m Tc to the reaction vial to make the final product. After being allowed to set at room temperature for 15 minutes to ensure maximum tagging of 99mTc to the human albumin, the kit can then be diluted with sterile normal saline as needed.  Once prepared the product will have a turbid white appearance.  Quality control  Particle Size: No less than 90% of MAA particles can be between 10 - 90 micrometres in size and no particles may exceed 150 micrometres. Radiochemical purity: No less than 90% of the radioactivity present in the product must be tagged to albumin particles. Thus, no more than 10% soluble impurities may be present. Both of the above quality controls must be met before the product can be used in humans.  Indications, Dosage & Imaging   Perfusion lung imaging to assess the presence of pulmonary emboli  Isotope venography to identify lower extremity venous thrombosis  Assessment of peritoneovenous (LeVeen) shunt patency   The typical adult dose for a lung imaging study is 3-4 mCi (containing between 100,000 - 250,000 albumin particles). The particle burden should be lowered for most pediatric patients and lowered to 50,000 for infants. The use of more than 250,000 particles in a dose is controversial as little extra data is acquired from such scans while there is certainly an increased risk of toxicity. Patients with pulmonary hypertension should be administered a minimum amount of particles to achieve a lung scan (i.e. 60,000). In any patient by administering a greater amount of particles than necessary for the diagnostic procedure increases the risks of toxicity.  Because of gravity effects, patients administered 99m Tc MAA should be in the supine position to ensure as even a distribution of particles throughout the lungs as possible.  The total percentage of particles trapped in the lungs can be determined through a whole body scan after the administration of 99m Tc MAA through the equation    %  R  i  g  h  t  -  t  o  -  l  e  f  t  s  h  u  n  t  =   (    (    T  o  t  a   l   b  o  d   y   c  o  u  n  t   s    -   T  o  t  a   l   l  u  n   g   c  o  u  n  t  s    )    T  o  t  a   l   b  o  d   y   c  o  u  n  t  s    )   Ã—  100  %     fragments  percent  R  i  g  h  t   t  o   l  e  f  t  s  h  u  n  t    fragments  normal-(        T  o  t  a  l  b  o  d  y  c  o  u  n  t  s     T  o  t  a  l  l  u  n  g  c  o  u  n  t  s      T  o  t  a  l  b  o  d  y  c  o  u  n  t  s    normal-)    100  percent    \%Right-to-leftshunt=\left(\frac{(Total\ body\ counts\ -\ Total\ lung\ counts)%
