Borel right process

In the mathematical theory of probability, a Borel right process, named after Ã‰mile Borel, is a particular kind of continuous-time random process.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a locally compact, separable, metric space. We denote by 
 
 
 
  the Borel subsets of 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the space of right continuous maps from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  that have left limits in 
 
 
 
 , and for each 
 
 
 
 , denote by 
 
 
 
  the coordinate map at 
 
 
 
 ; for each 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the value of 
 
 
 
  at 
 
 
 
 . We denote the universal completion of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . For each 
 
 
 
 , let






and then, let






For each Borel measurable function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , define, for each 
 
 
 
 ,



Since 
 
 
 
  and the mapping given by 
 
 
 
  is right continuous, we see that for any uniformly continuous function

 
 , we have the mapping given by 
 
 
 
  is right continuous.
Therefore, together with the monotone class theorem, for any universally measurable function 
 
 
 
 , the mapping given by 
 
 
 
 , is jointly measurable, that is, 
 
 
 
  measurable, and subsequently, the mapping is also 
 
 
 
 -measurable for all finite measures 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 . Here, 
 
 
 
  is the completion of 
 
 
 
  with respect to the product measure 
 
 
 
 . Thus, for any bounded universally measurable function 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , the mapping 
 
 
 
  is Lebeague measurable, and hence, for each 
 
 
 
 , one can define



There is enough joint measurability to check that 
 
 
 
  is a Markov resolvent on 
 
 
 
 , which uniquely associated with the Markovian semigroup 
 
 
 
 . Consequently, one may apply Fubini's theorem to see that



The followings are the defining properties of Borel right processes:

' Hypothesis Droite 1':


For each probability measure 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , there exists a probability measure 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  is a Markov process with initial measure 
 
 
 
  and transition semigroup 
 
 
 
 .
 


' Hypothesis Droite 2':


Let 
 
 
 
  be 
 
 
 
 -excessive for the resolvent on 
 
 
 
 
 . Then, for each probability measure 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , a mapping given by 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  almost surely right continuous on 
 
 
 
 
 .
