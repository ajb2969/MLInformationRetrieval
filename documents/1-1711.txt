   Statcoulomb      Statcoulomb   The statcoulomb ( statC ) or franklin ( Fr ) or electrostatic unit of charge ( esu ) is the physical unit for electrical charge used in the esu-cgs (centimetre-gram-second system of units) and Gaussian units . It is a derived unit given by   1 statC = 1 g 1/2 cm 3/2 s ‚àí1 = 1 erg 1/2 cm 1/2 .   The SI system of units uses the coulomb (C) instead. The conversion between C and statC is different in different contexts. The most common contexts are:   For electric charge :  1 C ‚Üî  statC ‚âà  ‚áí 1 statC ‚Üî ~.     For electric flux (Œ¶ D ):  1 C ‚Üî 4œÄ√ó statC ‚âà  ‚áí 1 statC ‚Üî ~.    The symbol "‚Üî" is used instead of "=" because the two sides are not necessarily interchangeable, as discussed below . The number  is 10 times the value of the speed of light expressed in meters/second, and the conversions are exact except where indicated. The second context implies that the SI and cgs units for an electric displacement field (D) are related by:   1 C/m 2 ‚Üî 4œÄ√ó√ó10 ‚àí4 statC/cm 2 ‚âà   ‚áí 1 statC/cm 2 ‚Üî ~    due to the relation between the metre and the centimetre . The coulomb is an extremely large charge rarely encountered in electrostatics, while the statcoulomb is closer to everyday charges.  Definition and relation to cgs base units  The statcoulomb is defined as follows: if two stationary objects each carry a charge of 1 statC and are 1¬†cm apart, they will electrically repel each other with a force of 1 dyne . This repulsion is governed by Coulomb's law , which in the Gaussian-cgs system states:      F  =     q  1    q  2     r  2        F       subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2     superscript  r  2      F=\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}   where F is the force, q 1 and q 2 are the two charges, and r is the distance between the charges. Performing dimensional analysis on Coulomb's law, the dimension of electrical charge in cgs must be [mass] 1/2 [length] 3/2 [time] ‚àí1 . (This statement is not true in SI units; see below.) We can be more specific in light of the definition above: Plugging in F = 1 dyne, q 1 = q 2 = 1 statC, and r = 1¬†cm, we get:   1 statC = g 1/2 cm 3/2 s ‚àí1    as expected.  Dimensional relation between Statcoulomb and Coulomb  General incompatibility  Coulomb's law in cgs-Gaussian unit system and SI are respectively:      F  =     q  1    q  2     r  2        F       subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2     superscript  r  2      F=\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{r^{2}}   (cgs-Gaussian)      F  =     q  1    q  2     4  œÄ   œµ  0    r  2         F       subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2      4  œÄ   subscript  œµ  0    superscript  r  2       F=\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}   (SI) Since Œµ 0 , the vacuum permittivity , is not dimensionless, the coulomb (the SI unit of charge) is not dimensionally equivalent to [mass] 1/2 [length] 3/2 [time] ‚àí1 , unlike the statcoulomb. In fact, it is impossible to express the coulomb in terms of mass, length, and time alone.  Consequently, a conversion equation like "1 C = N statC" can be misleading: the units on the two sides are not consistent. One cannot freely switch between coulombs and statcoulombs within a formula or equation, as one would freely switch between centimeters and meters. One can, however, find a correspondence between coulombs and statcoulombs in different contexts. As described below, "1 C corresponds to " when describing the charge of objects. In other words, if a physical object has a charge of 1 C, it also has a charge of . Likewise, "1 C corresponds to " when describing an electric displacement field flux.  As a unit of charge  The statcoulomb is defined as follows: If two stationary objects each carry a charge of 1 statC and are 1¬†cm apart, they will electrically repel each other with a force of 1 dyne . From this definition, it is straightforward to find an equivalent charge in SI  coulombs . Using the SI equation      F  =     q  1    q  2     4  œÄ   œµ  0    r  2         F       subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2      4  œÄ   subscript  œµ  0    superscript  r  2       F=\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi\epsilon_{0}r^{2}}   (SI), and plugging in F = 1 dyne = 10 ‚àí5 N, and r = 1 cm = 10 ‚àí2 m, and then solving for q = q 1 = q 2 , the result is q = (1/2997924580)C ‚âà . Therefore, an object with a charge of 1 statC has a charge of .  This can also be expressed by the following conversion, which is fully dimensionally consistent, and often useful for switching between SI and cgs formulae:         1   C   /    4  œÄ   œµ  0      =    2997924580   statC           1  normal-C       4  œÄ   subscript  œµ  0        2997924580  statC     1\;\mathrm{C}/\sqrt{4\pi\epsilon_{0}}=2997924580\;\mathrm{statC}     As a unit of electric displacement field or flux  An electric flux (specifically, a flux of the electric displacement field  D ) has units of charge: statC in cgs and coulombs in SI. The conversion factor can be derived from Gauss's law :       Œ¶  D   =   4  œÄ  Q        subscript  normal-Œ¶  D     4  œÄ  Q     \Phi_{D}=4\pi Q   (cgs)       Œ¶  D   =  Q       subscript  normal-Œ¶  D   Q    \Phi_{D}=Q   (SI) where       Œ¶  D   ‚â°    ‚à´  S     ùêÉ  ‚ãÖ  d   ùêÄ         subscript  normal-Œ¶  D     subscript   S      normal-‚ãÖ  ùêÉ  normal-d   ùêÄ      \Phi_{D}\equiv\int_{S}\mathbf{D}\cdot\mathrm{d}\mathbf{A}   Therefore, the conversion factor for flux is 4œÄ different from the conversion factor for charge:         1   C  corresponds to  3.7673   √ó    10  10     statC          1  normal-C  corresponds to  3.7673    superscript  10  10    statC    1\;\mathrm{C}\text{ corresponds to }3.7673\times 10^{10}\;\mathrm{statC}   (as unit of Œ¶ D ). The dimensionally consistent version is:        1   C     4  œÄ   /   œµ  0      =    3.7673  √ó    10  10     statC         1  normal-C        4  œÄ    subscript  œµ  0          3.7673   superscript  10  10    statC     1\;\mathrm{C}\sqrt{4\pi/\epsilon_{0}}=3.7673\times 10^{10}\;\mathrm{statC}   (as unit of Œ¶ D ).
