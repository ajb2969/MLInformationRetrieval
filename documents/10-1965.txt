Dihydroneopterin aldolase

In enzymology, a dihydroneopterin aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(D-erythro-1,2,3-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8- dihydropteridine 
 
 
 
  2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine + glycolaldehyde
 

Thus, the substrate (biochemistry) of this enzyme is 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(D-erythro-1,2,3-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-dihydropteridine, whereas its two products are 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine and glycolaldehyde.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(D-erythro-1,2,3-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-dihydropt eridine glycolaldehyde-lyase (2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-hydroxymethyl-7,8-dihydropteridine-forming). Other names in common use include 2-amino-4-hydroxy-6-(D-erythro-1,2,3-trihydroxypropyl)-7,8-, and dihydropteridine glycolaldehyde-lyase. This enzyme participates in folate biosynthesis.
