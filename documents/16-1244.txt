Rassias' conjecture
In [[number theory]], '''Rassias' conjecture''' (named after Michael Th. Rassias) is an open problem related to [[prime numbers]]. It was conceived by M. Th. Rassias at a very young age, while preparing for the [[International Mathematical Olympiad]] (see {{cite book |last=Andreescu | first=T. | authorlink=Titu Andreescu | last2=Andrica | first2=D. | title=Number Theory: Structures, Examples and Problems | publisher=Birkhäuser, Boston, Basel | year=2009 | page=12 }}{{cite book |last=Balzarotti | first=G. |  last2=Lava | first2=P. P. | title=La Derivata Arithmetica | publisher=Editore Ulrico Hoepli Milano | year=2013 | pages=140

The conjecture states the following:
For every prime number

 
  there exist two prime numbers 
 
 

 
  with 
 
 
 
  This conjecture has a surprising feature of expressing a prime number as a quotient (see 6).
Relation to other open problems
Rassias' conjecture, can be stated equivalently as follows:
For any prime number

 
  there exist two prime numbers 
 
 

 
  with 
 
 
 
  namely the numbers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are consecutive.
By this reformulation, we see an interesting combination of a generalized Sophie Germain twin problem


 
  strengthened by the additional condition that 
 
 
 
  be a prime number too (see 78). We have seen that such questions are caught by the Hardy–Littlewood conjecture. One may ask if Rassias' conjecture is to some extent simpler than the general Hardy–Littlewood conjecture or its special case concerning distribution of generalized Sophie-Germain pairs 
 
 

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the set of prime numbers.
Probably the most general conjecture on distribution of prime constellations is Schinzel's hypothesis H:
Consider 
 
 
 
  polynomials 
 
 
 
  with positive leading coefficients and such that the product 
 
 
 
  is not divisible, as a polynomial, by any integer different from ±1. Then there is at least one integer 
 
 
 
  for which all the polynomials 
 
 
 
  take prime values.
Rassias' conjecture follows from the well-known Schinzel's hypothesis H for 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Note that Schinzel's hypothesis H appeared much earlier than Rassias' conjecture which is its special case. The reader is referred to the foreword of Preda Mihăilescu9 for a presentation of interconnections of Rassias' conjecture with other known conjectures and open problems in Number Theory. Further, another relevant open problem is related to Cunningham chains, i.e. sequences of primes


 
  for fixed coprime positive integers 
 
 
 
 .
There are computing competitions for the longest Cunningham chain or for the one built up of the largest primes – but unlike the breakthrough of Ben J. Green and Terence Tao,10 there is no general result known on large Cunningham chains to date. Rassias' conjecture can be also stated in terms of Cunningham chains, namely that there exist Cunningham chains with parameters 
 
 
 
  for $a$ such that $2a-1=p$ is a prime number (see 1112).
