   Hall's conjecture      Hall's conjecture   In mathematics , Hall's conjecture is an open question, , on the differences between perfect squares and perfect cubes . It asserts that a perfect square y 2 and a perfect cube x 3 that are not equal must lie a substantial distance apart. This question arose from consideration of the Mordell equation in the theory of integer points on elliptic curves .  The original version of Hall's conjecture, formulated by Marshall Hall, Jr. in 1970, says that there is a positive constant C such that for any integers x and y for which y 2 ≠ x 3 ,        |    y  2   -   x  3    |   >   C    |  x  |      .           superscript  y  2    superscript  x  3       C      x       |y^{2}-x^{3}|>C\sqrt{|x|}.     Hall suggested that perhaps C could be taken as 1/5, which was consistent with all the data known at the time the conjecture was proposed. Danilov showed in 1982 that the exponent 1/2 on the right side (that is, the use of | x | 1/2 ) can't be replaced by any higher power: for no δ > 0 is there a constant C such that | y 2 - x 3 | > C| x | 1/2 + δ whenever y 2 ≠ x 3 .  In 1965, Davenport proved an analogue of the above conjecture in the case of polynomials: if f ( t ) and g ( t ) are nonzero polynomials over C such that g ( t ) 3 ≠ f ( t ) 2 in C [ t ], then       deg   (    g    (  t  )   2    -   f    (  t  )   3     )    ≥     1  2    deg  f    (  t  )    +  1.        degree      g   superscript  t  2      f   superscript  t  3            1  2    degree  f   t   1.     \deg(g(t)^{2}-f(t)^{3})\geq\frac{1}{2}\deg f(t)+1.     The weak form of Hall's conjecture, due to Stark and Trotter around 1980, replaces the square root on the right side of the inequality by any exponent less than 1/2: for any ε > 0, there is some constant c (ε) depending on ε such that for any integers x and y for which y 2 ≠ x 3 ,        |    y  2   -   x  3    |   >   c   (  ε  )    x    1  /  2   -  ε      .           superscript  y  2    superscript  x  3       c  ε   superscript  x      1  2   ε       |y^{2}-x^{3}|>c(\varepsilon)x^{1/2-\varepsilon}.     The original, strong , form of the conjecture with exponent 1/2 has never been disproved, although it is no longer believed to be true and the term Hall's conjecture now generally means the version with the ε in it. For example, in 1998, Noam Elkies found the example  447884928428402042307918 2 - 5853886516781223 3 = -1641843,  for which compatibility with Hall's conjecture would require C to be less than .0214 ≈ 1/50, so roughly 10 times smaller than the original choice of 1/5 that Hall suggested.  The weak form of Hall's conjecture would follow from the ABC conjecture . 1 A generalization to other perfect powers is Pillai's conjecture .
