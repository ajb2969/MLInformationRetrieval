   Cone-shape distribution function      Cone-shape distribution function  The cone-shape distribution function, also known as the Zhao-Atlas-Marks time-frequency distribution, 1 (acronymized as the ZAM 2 3 4 distribution 5 or ZAMD 6 ), is one of the members of Cohen's class distribution function . 7 8 It was first proposed by Yunxin Zhao, Les E. Atlas, and Robert J. Marks II in 1990. 9 The distribution's name stems from the twin cone shape of the distribution's kernel function on the    t  ,  τ     t  τ    t,\tau   plane. 10 The advantage of the cone kernel function is that it can completely remove the cross-term between two components having the same center frequency. Cross-term results from components with the same time center, however, cannot be completely removed by the cone-shaped kernel. 11 12  Mathematical definition  The definition of the cone-shape distribution function is:         C  x    (  t  ,  f  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞     ∫   -  ∞   ∞     A  x    (  η  ,  τ  )   Φ   (  η  ,  τ  )    exp   (   j  2  π   (    η  t   -   τ  f    )    )    d   η   d  τ      ,         subscript  C  x    t  f      superscript   subscript            superscript   subscript             subscript  A  x    η  τ   normal-Φ   η  τ       j  2  π      η  t     τ  f      d  η  d  τ       C_{x}(t,f)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}A_{x}(\eta,\tau)\Phi(%
 \eta,\tau)\exp(j2\pi(\eta t-\tau f))\,d\eta\,d\tau,     where         A  x    (  η  ,  τ  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    x   (   t  +   τ  /  2    )    x  *    (   t  -   τ  /  2    )     e   -   j  2  π  t  η      d  t     ,         subscript  A  x    η  τ      superscript   subscript            x    t    τ  2     superscript  x      t    τ  2     superscript  e      j  2  π  t  η     d  t      A_{x}(\eta,\tau)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}x(t+\tau/2)x^{*}(t-\tau/2)e^{-j2\pi t%
 \eta}\,dt,     and the kernel function is        Φ   (  η  ,  τ  )    =     sin   (   π  η  τ   )     π  η  τ     exp   (   -   2  π  α   τ  2     )      .        normal-Φ   η  τ            π  η  τ      π  η  τ          2  π  α   superscript  τ  2         \Phi\left(\eta,\tau\right)=\frac{\sin\left(\pi\eta\tau\right)}{\pi\eta\tau}%
 \exp\left(-2\pi\alpha\tau^{2}\right).     The kernel function in    t  ,  τ     t  τ    t,\tau   domain is defined as:       ϕ   (  t  ,  τ  )    =   {         1  τ     exp   (   -   2  π  α   τ  2     )     ,        |  τ  |   ≥   2   |  t  |     ,        0  ,      otherwise  .             ϕ   t  τ     cases      1  τ         2  π  α   superscript  τ  2           τ     2    t     0  otherwise     \phi\left(t,\tau\right)=\begin{cases}\frac{1}{\tau}\exp\left(-2\pi\alpha\tau^{%
 2}\right),&|\tau|\geq 2|t|,\\
 0,&\mbox{otherwise}.\end{cases}     Following are the magnitude distribution of the kernel function in    t  ,  τ     t  τ    t,\tau   domain.  (Figure)  cone shape 1.jpg   Following are the magnitude distribution of the kernel function in    η  ,  τ     η  τ    \eta,\tau   domain with different   α   α   \alpha   values.  (Figure)  cone shape 2.jpg   As is seen in the figure above, a properly chosen kernel of cone-shape distribution function can filter out the interference on the   τ   τ   \tau   axis in the    η  ,  τ     η  τ    \eta,\tau   domain, or the ambiguity domain. Therefore, unlike the Choi-Williams distribution function , the cone-shape distribution function can effectively reduce the cross-term results form two component with same center frequency. However, the cross-terms on the   η   η   \eta   axis are still preserved.
