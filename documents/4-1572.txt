   Grothendieck universe      Grothendieck universe   In mathematics , a Grothendieck universe is a set U with the following properties:   If x is an element of U and if y is an element of x , then y is also an element of U . ( U is a transitive set .)  If x and y are both elements of U , then { x , y } is an element of U .  If x is an element of U , then P ( x ), the power set of x , is also an element of U .  If     {   x  α   }    α  ∈  I      subscript    subscript  x  α      α  I     \{x_{\alpha}\}_{\alpha\in I}   is a family of elements of U , and if I is an element of U , then the union     ⋃   α  ∈  I     x  α       subscript     α  I     subscript  x  α     \bigcup_{\alpha\in I}x_{\alpha}   is an element of U .   A Grothendieck universe is meant to provide a set in which all of mathematics can be performed. (In fact, uncountable Grothendieck universes provide models of set theory with the natural ∈-relation, natural powerset operation etc.) Elements of a Grothendieck universe are sometimes called small sets . The idea of universes is due to Alexander Grothendieck , who used them as a way of avoiding proper classes in algebraic geometry .  The existence of a nontrivial Grothendieck universe goes beyond the usual axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory ; in particular it would imply the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals . Tarski–Grothendieck set theory is an axiomatic treatment of set theory, used in some automatic proof systems, in which every set belongs to a Grothendieck universe. The concept of a Grothendieck universe can also be defined in a topos . 1  Properties  As an example, we will prove an easy proposition.   Proposition . If    x  ∈  U      x  U    x\in U   and    y  ⊆  x      y  x    y\subseteq x   , then    y  ∈  U      y  U    y\in U   .  Proof.    y  ∈   P   (  x  )        y    P  x     y\in P(x)   because    y  ⊆  x      y  x    y\subseteq x   .     P   (  x  )    ∈  U        P  x   U    P(x)\in U   because    x  ∈  U      x  U    x\in U   , so    y  ∈  U      y  U    y\in U   .   The axioms of Grothendieck universes imply that every set is an element of some Grothendieck universe.  It is similarly easy to prove that any Grothendieck universe U contains:   All singletons of each of its elements,  All products of all families of elements of U indexed by an element of U ,  All disjoint unions of all families of elements of U indexed by an element of U ,  All intersections of all families of elements of U indexed by an element of U ,  All functions between any two elements of U , and  All subsets of U whose cardinal is an element of U .   In particular, it follows from the last axiom that if U is non-empty, it must contain all of its finite subsets and a subset of each finite cardinality. One can also prove immediately from the definitions that the intersection of any class of universes is a universe.  Grothendieck universes and inaccessible cardinals  There are two simple examples of Grothendieck universes:   The empty set, and  The set of all hereditarily finite sets     V  ω     subscript  V  ω    V_{\omega}   .   Other examples are more difficult to construct. Loosely speaking, this is because Grothendieck universes are equivalent to strongly inaccessible cardinals . More formally, the following two axioms are equivalent:   (U) For each set x , there exists a Grothendieck universe U such that x ∈ U .  (C) For each cardinal κ, there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal λ that is strictly larger than κ.   To prove this fact, we introduce the function c ( U ). Define:       𝐜   (  U  )    =    sup   x  ∈  U     |  x  |          𝐜  U     subscript  supremum    x  U      x      \mathbf{c}(U)=\sup_{x\in U}|x|   where by | x | we mean the cardinality of x . Then for any universe U , c ( U ) is either zero or strongly inaccessible. Assuming it is non-zero, it is a strong limit cardinal because the power set of any element of U is an element of U and every element of U is a subset of U . To see that it is regular, suppose that c λ is a collection of cardinals indexed by I , where the cardinality of I and of each c λ is less than c ( U ). Then, by the definition of c ( U ), I and each c λ can be replaced by an element of U . The union of elements of U indexed by an element of U is an element of U , so the sum of the c λ has the cardinality of an element of U , hence is less than c ( U ). By invoking the axiom of foundation, that no set is contained in itself, it can be shown that c ( U ) equals | U |; when the axiom of foundation is not assumed, there are counterexamples (we may take for example U to be the set of all finite sets of finite sets etc. of the sets x α where the index α is any real number, and x α = { x α } for each α . Then U has the cardinality of the continuum, but all of its members have finite cardinality and so     𝐜   (  U  )    =   ℵ  0         𝐜  U    subscript  normal-ℵ  0     \mathbf{c}(U)=\aleph_{0}   ; see Bourbaki's article for more details).  Let κ be a strongly inaccessible cardinal. Say that a set S is strictly of type κ if for any sequence s n ∈ ... ∈ s 0 ∈ S , | s n | 0'' = x , and for each n , let x n +1 =   ⋃     \bigcup    x n be the union of the elements of x n . Let y =    ⋃  n     subscript   n    \bigcup_{n}    x n . By (C), there is a strongly inaccessible cardinal κ such that |y| \aleph_0, or a strongly inaccessible cardinal. And if κ is zero,    ℵ  0     subscript  normal-ℵ  0    \aleph_{0}   , or a strongly inaccessible cardinal, then there is a Grothendieck universe u(κ). Furthermore, u (| U |) = U , and | u ( κ )| = κ .  Since the existence of strongly inaccessible cardinals cannot be proved from the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (ZFC), the existence of universes other than the empty set and    V  ω     subscript  V  ω    V_{\omega}   cannot be proved from ZFC either. However, strongly inaccessible cardinals are on the lower end of the list of large cardinals ; thus, most set theories that use large cardinals (such as "ZFC plus there is a measurable cardinal ", "ZFC plus there are infinitely many Woodin cardinals ") will prove that Grothendieck universes exist.
