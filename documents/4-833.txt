   Motzkin number      Motzkin number   In mathematics , a Motzkin number for a given number n is the number of different ways of drawing non-intersecting chords between n points on a circle (not necessarily touching every point by a chord). The Motzkin numbers are named after Theodore Motzkin , and have very diverse applications in geometry , combinatorics and number theory .  Motzkin numbers    M  n     subscript  M  n    M_{n}   for    n  =   0  ,  1  ,  …       n   0  1  normal-…     n=0,1,\dots   form the sequence:   1, 1 , 2 , 4 , 9 , 21 , 51 , 127 , 323, 835, 2188, 5798, 15511, 41835, 113634, 310572, 853467, 2356779, 6536382, 18199284, 50852019, 142547559, 400763223, 1129760415, 3192727797, 9043402501, 25669818476, 73007772802, 208023278209, 593742784829, ...   Examples  The following figure shows the 9 ways to draw non-intersecting chords between 4 points on a circle.  (Figure)  MotzkinChords4.svg   The following figure shows the 21 ways to draw non-intersecting chords between 5 points on a circle.  (Figure)  MotzkinChords5.svg   Properties  Motzkin numbers satisfy the recurrence relation:        M   n  +  1    =    M  n   +    ∑   i  =  0    n  -  1      M  i    M   n  -  1  -  i       =       2  n   +  3    n  +  3     M  n    +     3  n    n  +  3     M   n  -  1       .         subscript  M    n  1       subscript  M  n     superscript   subscript     i  0      n  1       subscript  M  i    subscript  M    n  1  i                      2  n   3     n  3     subscript  M  n          3  n     n  3     subscript  M    n  1         M_{n+1}=M_{n}+\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}M_{i}M_{n-1-i}=\frac{2n+3}{n+3}M_{n}+\frac{3n}{n%
 +3}M_{n-1}.     Motzkin numbers can be expressed in terms of binomial coefficients and Catalan numbers :        M  n   =    ∑   k  =  0    ⌊   n  /  2   ⌋      (     n       2  k      )    C  k      .       subscript  M  n     superscript   subscript     k  0        n  2        binomial  n    2  k     subscript  C  k       M_{n}=\sum_{k=0}^{\lfloor n/2\rfloor}{\left({{n}\atop{2k}}\right)}C_{k}.     A Motzkin prime is a Motzkin number that is prime . , four such primes are known:   2, 127, 15511, 953467954114363   Combinatorial interpretations  The Motzkin number for n is also the number of positive integer sequences n −1 long in which the opening and ending elements are either 1 or 2, and the difference between any two consecutive elements is −1, 0 or 1.  Also on the upper right quadrant of a grid, the Motzkin number for n gives the number of routes from coordinate (0, 0) to coordinate ( n , 0) on n steps if one is allowed to move only to the right (up, down or straight) at each step but forbidden from dipping below the y = 0 axis.  For example, the following figure shows the 9 valid Motzkin paths from (0, 0) to (4, 0):  (Figure)  Motzkin4.svg   There are at least fourteen different manifestations of Motzkin numbers in different branches of mathematics, as enumerated by  in their survey of Motzkin numbers.  showed that vexillary involutions are enumerated by Motzkin numbers.
