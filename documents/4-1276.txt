   Blaschke product      Blaschke product   In complex analysis , the Blaschke product is a bounded analytic function in the open unit disc constructed to have zeros at a (finite or infinite) sequence of prescribed complex numbers   a 0 , a 1 , ...   inside the unit disc .  Blaschke products were introduced by . They are related to Hardy spaces .  Definition  A sequence of points    (   a  n   )     subscript  a  n    (a_{n})   inside the unit disk is said to satisfy the Blaschke condition when         ∑  n    (   1  -   |   a  n   |    )    <  ∞   .        subscript   n     1     subscript  a  n         \sum_{n}(1-|a_{n}|)<\infty.     Given a sequence obeying the Blaschke condition, the Blaschke product is defined as       B   (  z  )    =    ∏  n    B   (   a  n   ,  z  )           B  z     subscript  product  n     B    subscript  a  n   z       B(z)=\prod_{n}B(a_{n},z)     with factors       B   (  a  ,  z  )    =      |  a  |   a      a  -  z    1  -    a  ¯   z            B   a  z          a   a       a  z     1     normal-¯  a   z        B(a,z)=\frac{|a|}{a}\;\frac{a-z}{1-\overline{a}z}     provided a ≠ 0. Here    a  ¯     normal-¯  a    \overline{a}   is the complex conjugate of a . When a = 0 take B ( 0 , z ) = z .  The Blaschke product B ( z ) defines a function analytic in the open unit disc, and zero exactly at the a n (with multiplicity counted): furthermore it is in the Hardy class    H  ∞     superscript  H     H^{\infty}   . 1  The sequence of a n satisfying the convergence criterion above is sometimes called a Blaschke sequence .  Szegő theorem  A theorem of Gábor Szegő states that if f is in    H  1     superscript  H  1    H^{1}   , the Hardy space with integrable norm, and if f is not identically zero, then the zeroes of f (certainly countable in number) satisfy the Blaschke condition.  Finite Blaschke products  Finite Blaschke products can be characterized (as analytic functions on the unit disc) in the following way: Assume that f is an analytic function on the open unit disc such that f can be extended to a continuous function on the closed unit disc       Δ  ¯   =   {   z  ∈   ℂ    |    |  z  |   ≤  1   }        normal-¯  normal-Δ    conditional-set    z  ℂ       z   1      \overline{\Delta}=\{z\in\mathbb{C}\,|\,|z|\leq 1\}     which maps the unit circle to itself. Then ƒ is equal to a finite Blaschke product       B   (  z  )    =   ζ    ∏   i  =  1   n     (    z  -   a  i     1  -     a  i   ¯   z     )    m  i            B  z     ζ    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    superscript      z   subscript  a  i      1     normal-¯   subscript  a  i    z      subscript  m  i        B(z)=\zeta\prod_{i=1}^{n}\left({{z-a_{i}}\over{1-\overline{a_{i}}z}}\right)^{m%
