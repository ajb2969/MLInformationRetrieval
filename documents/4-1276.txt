Blaschke product

In complex analysis, the Blaschke product is a bounded analytic function in the open unit disc constructed to have zeros at a (finite or infinite) sequence of prescribed complex numbers

a0, a1, ...
 

inside the unit disc.
Blaschke products were introduced by . They are related to Hardy spaces.
Definition
A sequence of points 
 
 
 
  inside the unit disk is said to satisfy the Blaschke condition when



Given a sequence obeying the Blaschke condition, the Blaschke product is defined as



with factors



provided a ≠ 0. Here 
 
 
 
  is the complex conjugate of a. When a = 0 take B(0,z) = z.
The Blaschke product B(z) defines a function analytic in the open unit disc, and zero exactly at the an (with multiplicity counted): furthermore it is in the Hardy class 
 
 
 
 .1
The sequence of an satisfying the convergence criterion above is sometimes called a Blaschke sequence.
Szegő theorem
A theorem of Gábor Szegő states that if f is in 
 
 
 
 , the Hardy space with integrable norm, and if f is not identically zero, then the zeroes of f (certainly countable in number) satisfy the Blaschke condition.
Finite Blaschke products
Finite Blaschke products can be characterized (as analytic functions on the unit disc) in the following way: Assume that f is an analytic function on the open unit disc such that f can be extended to a continuous function on the closed unit disc



which maps the unit circle to itself. Then ƒ is equal to a finite Blaschke product



where ζ lies on the unit circle and mi is the multiplicity of the zero ai, |ai|
