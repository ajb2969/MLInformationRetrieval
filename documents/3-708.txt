   Mahler's theorem      Mahler's theorem   In mathematics, Mahler's theorem , introduced by , expresses continuous p -adic functions in terms of polynomials.  In any field , one has the following result. Let        (   Δ  f   )    (  x  )    =    f   (   x  +  1   )    -   f   (  x  )             normal-Δ  f   x       f    x  1      f  x      (\Delta f)(x)=f(x+1)-f(x)\,     be the forward difference operator . Then for polynomial functions  f we have the Newton series :        f   (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞     (    Δ  k   f   )    (  0  )    (     x      k     )      ,        f  x     superscript   subscript     k  0           superscript  normal-Δ  k   f   0   binomial  x  k       f(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}(\Delta^{k}f)(0){x\choose k},     where       (     x      k     )   =    x   (   x  -  1   )    (   x  -  2   )   ⋯   (    x  -  k   +  1   )     k  !         binomial  x  k       x    x  1     x  2   normal-⋯      x  k   1      k      {x\choose k}=\frac{x(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-k+1)}{k!}     is the k th binomial coefficient polynomial.  Over the field of real numbers, the assumption that the function f is a polynomial can be weakened, but it cannot be weakened all the way down to mere continuity .  Mahler's theorem states that if f is a continuous p-adic -valued function on the p -adic integers then the same identity holds.  The relationship between the operator Δ and this polynomial sequence is much like that between differentiation and the sequence whose k th term is x k .  It is remarkable that as weak an assumption as continuity is enough; by contrast, Newton series on the complex number field are far more tightly constrained, and require Carlson's theorem to hold.  It is a fact of algebra that if f is a polynomial function with coefficients in any field of characteristic 0, the same identity holds where the sum has finitely many terms.
