Boggio's formula

In the mathematical field of potential theory, Boggio's formula is an explicit formula for the Green's function for the polyharmonic Dirichlet problem on the ball of radius 1. It was discovered by the Italian mathematician Tommaso Boggio.
The polyharmonic problem is to find a function u satisfying


 
  where m is a positive integer, and 
 
 
 
  represents the Laplace operator. The Green's function is a function satisfying


 
  where 
 
 
 
  represents the Dirac delta distribution, and in addition is equal to 0 up to order m-1 at the boundary.
Boggio found that the Green's function on the ball in n spatial dimensions is


 
  The constant 
 
 
 
  is given by


 
  where
