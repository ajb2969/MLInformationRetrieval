   Richard Shore      Richard Shore   Richard A. Shore is a professor of mathematics at Cornell University who works in recursion theory . He is particularly known for his work on   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   , the partial order of the Turing degrees .   Shore settled the Rogers Homogeneity Conjecture by showing that there are Turing degrees   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   such that    𝒟  a     subscript  𝒟  a    \mathcal{D}_{a}   and    𝒟  b     subscript  𝒟  b    \mathcal{D}_{b}   , the structures of the degrees above   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   respectively, are not isomorphic. 1  In joint work with Theodore Slaman , Shore showed that the Turing jump is definable in   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   . 2   In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society . 3  References  External links   Cornell Math - Richard A.
