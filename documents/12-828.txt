Richard Shore

Richard A. Shore is a professor of mathematics at Cornell University who works in recursion theory. He is particularly known for his work on 
 
 
 
 , the partial order of the Turing degrees.

Shore settled the Rogers Homogeneity Conjecture by showing that there are Turing degrees 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , the structures of the degrees above 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively, are not isomorphic.1
In joint work with Theodore Slaman, Shore showed that the Turing jump is definable in 
 
 
 
 .2

In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society.3
