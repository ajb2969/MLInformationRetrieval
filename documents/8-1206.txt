   X-ray standing waves      X-ray standing waves   The X-ray standing wave (XSW) technique can be used to study the structure of surfaces and interfaces with high spatial resolution and chemical selectivity. Pioneered by B.W. Batterman in the 1960s 1 the availability of synchrotron light has stimulated the application of this interferometric technique to a wide range of problems in surface science. 2 3  Basic principles  (Figure)  Principle of X-ray standing wave measurements   An X-ray interference field created by Bragg reflection provides the length scale against which atomic distances can be measured. The spatial modulation of this field described by the dynamical theory of X-ray diffraction undergoes a pronounced change when the sample is scanned through the Bragg condition. Due to a relative phase variation between the incoming and the reflected beam the nodal planes of the XSW field shift by half a lattice constant. 4  Depending on the position of the atoms within this wave field the element specific absorption of X-rays varies in a characteristic way. Therefore, measurement of the photo yield – via X-ray fluorescence or photoelectron spectroscopy – can reveal the position of the atoms relative to the lattice planes.  For a quantitative analysis the normalized photo yield    Y  p     subscript  Y  p    Y_{p}   is described by 5 6         Y  p    (  Ω  )    =   1  +  R  +   2  C   R    f  H    cos   (   ν  -   2  π   P  H     )             subscript  Y  p   normal-Ω     1  R    2  C    R    subscript  f  H       ν    2  π   subscript  P  H          Y_{p}(\Omega)=1+R+2C\sqrt{R}f_{H}\cos(\nu-2\pi P_{H})   ,   where   R   R   R   is the reflectivity and   ν   ν   \nu   is the relative phase of the interfering beams. The characteristic shape of    Y  p     subscript  Y  p    Y_{p}   can be used to derive precise structural information about the surface atoms because the two parameters    f  H     subscript  f  H    f_{H}   (coherent fraction) and    P  H     subscript  P  H    P_{H}   (coherent position) are directly related to the Fourier representation of the atomic distribution function.

Therefore, and with a sufficiently large number of Fourier components being measured, XSW data can be used to establish the distribution of the different atoms in the unit cell (XSW imaging) 7   Selected applications  which require ultra-high vacuum conditions   Physisorption and chemisorption studies 8 9  Diffusion of dopants in crystals 10  Superlattices and Quasi-crystal characterization   which do not require ultra-high vacuum conditions   Langmuir-Blodgett films  Self-assembled monolayers  Buried interfaces   See also   List of surface analysis methods   References  Further reading  "  Category:Condensed matter physics  Category:Experimental physics  Category:Spectroscopy  Standing     B.
