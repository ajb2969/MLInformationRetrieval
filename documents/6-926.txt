   Square degree      Square degree   A square degree is a non- SI  unit measure of solid angle . It is denoted in various ways, including deg 2 , sq.deg. , (°)², and ☐°. Just as degrees are used to measure parts of a circle, square degrees are used to measure parts of a sphere . Analogous to one degree being equal to π /180 radians, a square degree is equal to ( π /180) 2 , or about 1/3283 or 3.0462     ×    10  -   4       absent     superscript  10    4     \times 10^{-}4    steradian (0.30462 msr). The number of square degrees in a whole sphere is        4  π    (   180  π   )   2    =   129 600  π    ,        4  π   superscript    180  π   2      129 600  π     4\pi\left(\frac{180}{\pi}\right)^{2}=\frac{129\,600}{\pi},     or approximately 41 253 deg 2 . This is the total area of the 88 constellations in the list of constellations by area . The largest constellation, Hydra , covers a solid angle of 1303 deg 2 , whereas the smallest, Crux , covers 68 deg 2 . 1  For example, observed from the surface of the Earth , the sun and the full moon both have a diameter of approximately 0.5°, so each of them covers a solid angle of approximately 0.2 deg 2 (≈ π (    0.5  2      0.5  2    \frac{0.5}{2}   ) 2 deg 2 ), which is 4.8 × 10 −6 of the total sky sphere.  Assuming the Earth to be a sphere with a surface area of 510 000 000 km 2 , the area of Northern Ireland , 13 600 km 2 , represents a solid angle of 1.10 deg 2 . 2 Similarly, the area of Connecticut , 14 356 km 2 , represents a solid angle of 1.16 deg 2 . 3  See also   Steradian   References    External links   http://calgary.rasc.ca/constellation.htm#square   "  Category:Units of angle     RASC Calgary Centre - The Constellations ↩  Country Profiles: Key Statistics - Northern Ireland, August 2012 ↩  [ http://m.usembassy.gov/67133/show/48cfb5952231d07616e065c4e972a2b4&t; ;=3854e8b8732893e84a65c8b81e3312c1 The 50 States | Embassies & Consulates Directory] ↩
