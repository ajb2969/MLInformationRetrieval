   P-matrix      P-matrix   In mathematics , a    P   P   P   -matrix is a complex square matrix with every principal minor > 0. A closely related class is that of    P  0     subscript  P  0    P_{0}   -matrices, which are the closure of the class of   P   P   P   -matrices, with every principal minor   ≥     \geq   0.  Spectra of   P   P   P   -matrices  By a theorem of Kellogg, the eigenvalues of   P   P   P   - and    P  0     subscript  P  0    P_{0}   - matrices are bounded away from a wedge about the negative real axis as follows:   If    {   u  1   ,  …  ,   u  n   }      subscript  u  1   normal-…   subscript  u  n     \{u_{1},...,u_{n}\}   are the eigenvalues of an   n   n   n   -dimensional   P   P   P   -matrix, then       |   a  r  g   (   u  i   )    |   <   π  -   π  n     ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence        a  r  g   subscript  u  i       π    π  n       i   1  normal-…  n      |arg(u_{i})|<\pi-\frac{\pi}{n},i=1,...,n      If    {   u  1   ,  …  ,   u  n   }      subscript  u  1   normal-…   subscript  u  n     \{u_{1},...,u_{n}\}   ,     u  i   ≠  0       subscript  u  i   0    u_{i}\neq 0   ,    i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       i   1  normal-…  n     i=1,...,n   are the eigenvalues of an   n   n   n   -dimensional    P  0     subscript  P  0    P_{0}   -matrix, then       |   a  r  g   (   u  i   )    |   ≤   π  -   π  n     ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n       formulae-sequence        a  r  g   subscript  u  i       π    π  n       i   1  normal-…  n      |arg(u_{i})|\leq\pi-\frac{\pi}{n},i=1,...,n       Remarks  The class of nonsingular M -matrices is a subset of the class of   P   P   P   -matrices. More precisely, all matrices that are both   P   P   P   -matrices and Z -matrices are nonsingular   M   M   M   -matrices. The class of sufficient matrices is another generalization of   P   P   P   -matrices. 1  If the Jacobian of a function is a   P   P   P   -matrix, then the function is injective on any rectangular region of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   .  A related class of interest, particularly with reference to stability, is that of    P   (  -  )      superscript  P     P^{(-)}   -matrices, sometimes also referred to as    N  -  P      N  P    N-P   -matrices. A matrix   A   A   A   is a    P   (  -  )      superscript  P     P^{(-)}   -matrix if and only if    (   -  A   )      A    (-A)   is a   P   P   P   -matrix (similarly for    P  0     subscript  P  0    P_{0}   -matrices). Since     σ   (  A  )    =   -   σ   (   -  A   )           σ  A       σ    A       \sigma(A)=-\sigma(-A)   , the eigenvalues of these matrices are bounded away from the positive real axis .
