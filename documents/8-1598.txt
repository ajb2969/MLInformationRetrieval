P-matrix

In mathematics, a 

 
 -matrix is a complex square matrix with every principal minor > 0. A closely related class is that of 
 
 
 
 -matrices, which are the closure of the class of 
 
 
 
 -matrices, with every principal minor 
 
 
 
  0.
Spectra of 
 
 
 
 -matrices
By a theorem of Kellogg, the eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
 - and 
 
 
 
 - matrices are bounded away from a wedge about the negative real axis as follows:

If 
 
 
 
  are the eigenvalues of an 
 
 
 
 -dimensional 
 
 
 
 -matrix, then
 
 



If 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are the eigenvalues of an 
 
 
 
 -dimensional 
 
 
 
 -matrix, then
 
 




Remarks
The class of nonsingular M-matrices is a subset of the class of 
 
 
 
 -matrices. More precisely, all matrices that are both 
 
 
 
 -matrices and Z-matrices are nonsingular 
 
 
 
 -matrices. The class of sufficient matrices is another generalization of 
 
 
 
 -matrices.1
If the Jacobian of a function is a 
 
 
 
 -matrix, then the function is injective on any rectangular region of 
 
 
 
 .
A related class of interest, particularly with reference to stability, is that of 
 
 
 
 -matrices, sometimes also referred to as 
 
 
 
 -matrices. A matrix 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -matrix if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -matrix (similarly for 
 
 
 
 -matrices). Since 
 
 
 
 , the eigenvalues of these matrices are bounded away from the positive real axis.
