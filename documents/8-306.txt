Axilrod–Teller potential

The Axilrod–Teller potential is a three-body potential that results from a third-order perturbation correction to the attractive London dispersion interactions (instantaneous induced dipole-induced dipole)



where 
 
 
 
  is the distance between atoms 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is the angle between the vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The coefficient 
 
 
 
  is positive and of the order 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the ionization energy and 
 
 
 
  is the mean atomic polarizability; the exact value of 
 
 
 
  depends on the magnitudes of the dipole matrix elements and on the energies of the 
 
 
 
  orbitals.
