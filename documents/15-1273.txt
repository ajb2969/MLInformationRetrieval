TRNA (cytosine34-C5)-methyltransferase

TRNA (cytosine34-C5)-methyltransferase (, hTrm4 Mtase, hTrm4 methyltransferase, hTrm4 (gene), tRNA:m5C-methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytosine34-C5)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine34 in tRNA precursor 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine34 in tRNA precursor
 

The human enzyme is specific for C5-methylation of cytosine34 in tRNA precursors.
