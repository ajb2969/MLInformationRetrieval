   TRNA (cytosine34-C5)-methyltransferase      TRNA (cytosine34-C5)-methyltransferase   TRNA (cytosine34-C5)-methyltransferase (, hTrm4 Mtase , hTrm4 methyltransferase , hTrm4 (gene) , tRNA:m5C-methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (cytosine34-C5)-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 34 in tRNA precursor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 5-methylcytosine 34 in tRNA precursor   The human enzyme is specific for C 5 -methylation of cytosine 34 in tRNA precursors.
