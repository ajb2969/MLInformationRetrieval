   Saddle point      Saddle point   In mathematics , a saddle point is a point in the domain of a function that is a stationary point but not a local extremum . The name derives from the fact that the prototypical example in two dimensions is a surface that curves up in one direction, and curves down in a different direction, resembling a saddle or a mountain pass . In terms of contour lines , a saddle point in two dimensions gives rise to a contour that appears to intersect itself.  Mathematical discussion  A simple criterion for checking if a given stationary point of a real-valued function F ( x , y ) of two real variables is a saddle point is to compute the function's Hessian matrix at that point: if the Hessian is indefinite , then that point is a saddle point. For example, the Hessian matrix of the function    z  =    x  2   -   y  2        z     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      z=x^{2}-y^{2}   at the stationary point    (  0  ,  0  )     0  0    (0,0)   is the matrix      [     2    0      0     -  2      ]      2  0    0    2      \begin{bmatrix}2&0\\
 0&-2\\
 \end{bmatrix}   which is indefinite. Therefore, this point is a saddle point. This criterion gives only a sufficient condition. For example, the point    (  0  ,  0  )     0  0    (0,0)   is a saddle point for the function     z  =    x  4   -   y  4     ,      z     superscript  x  4    superscript  y  4      z=x^{4}-y^{4},   but the Hessian matrix of this function at the origin is the null matrix, which is not indefinite.  In the most general terms, a saddle point for a smooth function (whose graph is a curve , surface or hypersurface ) is a stationary point such that the curve/surface/etc. in the neighborhood of that point is not entirely on any side of the tangent space at that point.  In one dimension, a saddle point is a point which is both a stationary point and a point of inflection . Since it is a point of inflection, it is not a local extremum .  Other uses  In dynamical systems , if the dynamic is given by a differentiable map  f then a point is hyperbolic if and only if the differential of ƒ  n (where n is the period of the point) has no eigenvalue on the (complex) unit circle when computed at the point. Then a saddle point is a hyperbolic periodic point whose stable and unstable manifolds have a dimension that is not zero.  In a two-player zero sum game defined on a continuous space, the equilibrium point is a saddle point.  A saddle point of a matrix is an element which is both the largest element in its column and the smallest element in its row.  For a second-order linear autonomous systems, a critical point is a saddle point if the characteristic equation has one positive and one negative real eigenvalue. 1  See also   Saddle-point method is an extension of Laplace's method for approximating integrals  Extremum  First derivative test  Second derivative test  Higher-order derivative test  Saddle surface  Hyperbolic equilibrium point  Sion's minimax theorem  Mountain pass  Max–min inequality   Notes    References         "  Category:Differential geometry of surfaces  Category:Multivariable calculus  Category:Stability theory  Category:Analytic geometry     ↩
