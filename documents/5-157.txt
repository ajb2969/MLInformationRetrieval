   Suspension (topology)      Suspension (topology)   In topology , the suspension  SX of a topological space  X is the quotient space :      S  X  =   (  X  ×  I  )   /   {   (   x  1   ,  0  )   ∼   (   x  2   ,  0  )   and   (   x  1   ,  1  )   ∼   (   x  2   ,  1  )   for all   x  1   ,   x  2   ∈  X  }      fragments  S  X    fragments  normal-(  X   I  normal-)     fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-,  0  normal-)   similar-to   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  2   normal-,  0  normal-)   and   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  1   normal-,  1  normal-)   similar-to   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  2   normal-,  1  normal-)   for all   subscript  x  1   normal-,   subscript  x  2    X  normal-}     SX=(X\times I)/\{(x_{1},0)\sim(x_{2},0)\mbox{ and }(x_{1},1)\sim(x_{2},1)\mbox%
 { for all }x_{1},x_{2}\in X\}     of the product of X with the unit interval  I = [0, 1]. Thus, X is stretched into a cylinder and then both ends are collapsed to points. One views X as "suspended" between the end points. One can also view the suspension as two cones on X  glued together at their base (or as a quotient of a single cone).  Given a continuous map     f  :   X  →  Y    ,     normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\rightarrow Y,   there is a map     S  f   :    S  X   →   S  Y       normal-:    S  f    normal-→    S  X     S  Y      Sf:SX\rightarrow SY   defined by      S  f   (   [  x  ,  t  ]   )    :=   [   f   (  x  )    ,  t  ]    .     assign    S  f   x  t       f  x   t     Sf([x,t]):=[f(x),t].   This makes   S   S   S   into a functor from the category of topological spaces into itself. In rough terms S increases the dimension of a space by one: it takes an n - sphere to an ( n + 1)-sphere for n ≥ 0.  The space    S  X      S  X    SX   is homeomorphic to the join      X  ⋆   S  0    ,     normal-⋆  X   superscript  S  0     X\star S^{0},   where    S  0     superscript  S  0    S^{0}   is a discrete space with two points.  The space    S  X      S  X    SX   is sometimes called the unreduced , unbased , or free suspension of   X   X   X   , to distinguish it from the reduced suspension described below.  The suspension can be used to construct a homomorphism of homotopy groups , to which the Freudenthal suspension theorem applies. In homotopy theory , the phenomena which are preserved under suspension, in a suitable sense, make up stable homotopy theory .  Reduced suspension  If X is a pointed space (with basepoint x 0 ), there is a variation of the suspension which is sometimes more useful. The reduced suspension or based suspension Σ X of X is the quotient space:       Σ  X   =    (   X  ×  I   )   /   (    X  ×   {  0  }    ∪   X  ×   {  1  }    ∪    {   x  0   }   ×  I    )          normal-Σ  X       X  I       X   0      X   1        subscript  x  0    I       \Sigma X=(X\times I)/(X\times\{0\}\cup X\times\{1\}\cup\{x_{0}\}\times I)   .  This is the equivalent to taking SX and collapsing the line ( x 0 × I ) joining the two ends to a single point. The basepoint of Σ X is the equivalence class of ( x 0 , 0).  One can show that the reduced suspension of X is homeomorphic to the smash product of X with the unit circle  S 1 .       Σ  X   ≅    S  1   ∧  X         normal-Σ  X      superscript  S  1   X     \Sigma X\cong S^{1}\wedge X     For well-behaved spaces, such as CW complexes , the reduced suspension of X is homotopy equivalent to the ordinary suspension.  Σ gives rise to a functor from the category of pointed spaces to itself. An important property of this functor is that it is a left adjoint to the functor   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   taking a (based) space   X   X   X   to its loop space     Ω  X      normal-Ω  X    \Omega X   . In other words,        Maps  *    (   Σ  X   ,  Y  )    ≅    Maps  *    (  X  ,   Ω  Y   )          subscript  Maps      normal-Σ  X   Y     subscript  Maps    X    normal-Ω  Y      \operatorname{Maps}_{*}\left(\Sigma X,Y\right)\cong\operatorname{Maps}_{*}%
 \left(X,\Omega Y\right)     naturally, where     Maps  *    (  X  ,  Y  )       subscript  Maps    X  Y    \operatorname{Maps}_{*}\left(X,Y\right)   stands for continuous maps which preserve basepoints. This is not the case for unreduced suspension and free loop space.  Desuspension  Desuspension is an operation inverse to suspension. 1  See also   Cone (topology)  Join (topology)   References   Allen Hatcher , Algebraic topology.
