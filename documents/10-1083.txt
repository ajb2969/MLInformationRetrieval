5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol + NAD(P)H + H+ + O2

 
  cholesta-5,7-dien-3beta-ol + NAD(P)+ + 2 H2O

The 5 substrates of this enzyme are 5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol, NADH, NADPH, H+, and O2, whereas its 4 products are cholesta-5,7-dien-3beta-ol, NAD+, NADP+, and H2O.
Classification
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and the other dehydrogenated.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5alpha-cholest-7-en-3beta-ol,NAD(P)H:oxygen 5-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include Delta7-sterol Delta5-dehydrogenase, Delta7-sterol 5-desaturase, Delta7-sterol-C5(6)-desaturase, and 5-DES.
Biological role
This enzyme participates in biosynthesis of steroids. It has 2 cofactors: FAD, and FMN.
