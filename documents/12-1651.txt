Papyrus 121

Papyrus 121 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by 
 
 
121, is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek. It is a papyrus manuscript of the Gospel of John. The surviving texts of John are only fragments of verses 19:17-18,25-26. They are in very fragmentary condition. The manuscript paleographically has been assigned to the 3rd century by the INTF.1
The manuscript currently is housed at the Papyrology Rooms of the Sackler Library at Oxford with the shelf number P. Oxy. 4805.2
Description
The manuscript is written irregular, spaces between letters are not equal. Though the text is very small, it contains two of the nomina sacra: ΙΣ and ΜΗΙ (dative case from ΜΗΡ). Above letter iota two dots (diaeresis). On page recto, in lower line, from the left a scribe did not used letter iota in word και (and), though inserted diaeresis above letter alpha. Possibly it is a scribal error.
