   Papyrus 121      Papyrus 121   Papyrus 121 (in the Gregory-Aland numbering), designated by   𝔓   𝔓   \mathfrak{P}    121 , is an early copy of the New Testament in Greek . It is a papyrus  manuscript of the Gospel of John . The surviving texts of John are only fragments of verses 19:17-18,25-26. They are in very fragmentary condition. The manuscript paleographically has been assigned to the 3rd century by the INTF . 1  The manuscript currently is housed at the Papyrology Rooms of the Sackler Library at Oxford with the shelf number P. Oxy. 4805. 2  Description  The manuscript is written irregular, spaces between letters are not equal. Though the text is very small, it contains two of the nomina sacra : ΙΣ and ΜΗΙ ( dative case from ΜΗΡ ). Above letter iota two dots ( diaeresis ). On page recto, in lower line, from the left a scribe did not used letter iota in word και (and), though inserted diaeresis above letter alpha . Possibly it is a scribal error.  Text  (Figure)  Papyrus 121 V   The Greek text of the codex is too brief to determine its textual character. It can not be placed to any of Categories of New Testament manuscripts . It contains only 20 letters on recto, and 18 letters on verso.
