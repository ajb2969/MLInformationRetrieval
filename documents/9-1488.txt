Skew-Hamiltonian matrix

In linear algebra, skew-Hamiltonian matrices are special matrices which correspond to skew-symmetric bilinear forms on a symplectic vector space.
Let V be a vector space, equipped with a symplectic form

 
 . Such a space must be even-dimensional. A linear map 
 
 
 
  is called a skew-Hamiltonian operator with respect to 
 
 
 
  if the form 
 
 
 
  is skew-symmetric.
Choose a basis 
 
 
 
  in V, such that 
 
 
 
  is written as 
 
 
 
 . Then a linear operator is skew-Hamiltonian with respect to 
 
 
 
  if and only if its matrix A satisfies 
 
 
 
 , where J is the skew-symmetric matrix



and In is the 
 
 
identity matrix.1 Such matrices are called skew-Hamiltonian.
The square of a Hamiltonian matrix is skew-Hamiltonian. The converse is also true: every skew-Hamiltonian matrix can be obtained as the square of a Hamiltonian matrix.23
