   Skew-Hamiltonian matrix      Skew-Hamiltonian matrix   In linear algebra , skew-Hamiltonian matrices are special matrices which correspond to skew-symmetric bilinear forms on a symplectic vector space .  Let V be a vector space , equipped with a symplectic form    Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   . Such a space must be even-dimensional. A linear map    A  :   V  ↦  V      normal-:  A   maps-to  V  V     A:\;V\mapsto V   is called a skew-Hamiltonian operator with respect to   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   if the form     x  ,  y   ↦   Ω   (   A   (  x  )    ,  y  )       maps-to   x  y     normal-Ω     A  x   y      x,y\mapsto\Omega(A(x),y)   is skew-symmetric.  Choose a basis     e  1   ,   …   e   2  n         subscript  e  1     normal-…   subscript  e    2  n       e_{1},...e_{2n}   in V , such that   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is written as      ∑  i    e  i    ∧   e   n  +  i          subscript   i    subscript  e  i     subscript  e    n  i      \sum_{i}e_{i}\wedge e_{n+i}   . Then a linear operator is skew-Hamiltonian with respect to   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   if and only if its matrix A satisfies      A  T   J   =   J  A          superscript  A  T   J     J  A     A^{T}J=JA   , where J is the skew-symmetric matrix      J  =   [     0     I  n        -   I  n      0     ]       J    0   subscript  I  n        subscript  I  n    0      J=\begin{bmatrix}0&I_{n}\\
 -I_{n}&0\\
 \end{bmatrix}     and I n is the    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n    identity matrix . 1 Such matrices are called skew-Hamiltonian .  The square of a Hamiltonian matrix is skew-Hamiltonian. The converse is also true: every skew-Hamiltonian matrix can be obtained as the square of a Hamiltonian matrix. 2 3  Notes    "  Category:Matrices  Category:Linear algebra     William C.
