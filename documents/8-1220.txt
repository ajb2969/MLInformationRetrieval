   General frame      General frame   In logic , general frames (or simply frames ) are Kripke frames with an additional structure, which are used to model modal and intermediate logics. The general frame semantics combines the main virtues of Kripke semantics and algebraic semantics : it shares the transparent geometrical insight of the former, and robust completeness of the latter.  Definition  A modal general frame is a triple    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F  R  V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,R,V\rangle   , where    ⟨  F  ,  R  ⟩     F  R    \langle F,R\rangle   is a Kripke frame (i.e., R is a binary relation on the set F ), and V is a set of subsets of F which is closed under   the Boolean operations of (binary) intersection , union , and complement ,  the operation   □   normal-□   \Box   , defined by    □  A  =   {  x  ∈  F  ;  ∀  y  ∈   F    (   x    R   y  →  y  ∈  A  )   }      fragments  □  A    fragments  normal-{  x   F  normal-;  for-all  y   F   fragments  normal-(  x  R  y  normal-→  y   A  normal-)   normal-}     \Box A=\{x\in F;\,\forall y\in F\,(x\,R\,y\to y\in A)\}   .   The purpose of V is to restrict the allowed valuations in the frame: a model    ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  ⊩  ⟩     F  R  forces    \langle F,R,\Vdash\rangle   based on the Kripke frame    ⟨  F  ,  R  ⟩     F  R    \langle F,R\rangle   is admissible in the general frame F , if       {  x  ∈  F  ;  x  ⊩  p  }   ∈  V     fragments   fragments  normal-{  x   F  normal-;  x  forces  p  normal-}    V    \{x\in F;\,x\Vdash p\}\in V   for every propositional variable  p . The closure conditions on V then ensure that    {    x  ∈  F   ;   x  ⊩  A    }      formulae-sequence    x  F    forces  x  A      \{x\in F;\,x\Vdash A\}   belongs to V for every formula A (not only a variable).  A formula A is valid in F , if    x  ⊩  A     forces  x  A    x\Vdash A   for all admissible valuations   ⊩   forces   \Vdash   , and all points    x  ∈  F      x  F    x\in F   . A normal modal logic  L is valid in the frame F , if all axioms (or equivalently, all theorems) of L are valid in F . In this case we call F an L - frame .  A Kripke frame    ⟨  F  ,  R  ⟩     F  R    \langle F,R\rangle   may be identified with a general frame in which all valuations are admissible: i.e.,    ⟨  F  ,  R  ,   𝒫   (  F  )    ⟩     F  R    𝒫  F     \langle F,R,\mathcal{P}(F)\rangle   , where    𝒫   (  F  )       𝒫  F    \mathcal{P}(F)   denotes the power set of F .  Types of frames  In full generality, general frames are hardly more than a fancy name for Kripke models ; in particular, the correspondence of modal axioms to properties on the accessibility relation is lost. This can be remedied by imposing additional conditions on the set of admissible valuations.  A frame    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F  R  V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,R,V\rangle   is called   differentiated , if    ∀  A  ∈   V    (  x  ∈  A  ⇔  y  ∈  A  )      fragments  for-all  A   V   fragments  normal-(  x   A  normal-⇔  y   A  normal-)     \forall A\in V\,(x\in A\Leftrightarrow y\in A)   implies    x  =  y      x  y    x=y   ,  tight , if    ∀  A  ∈   V    (  x  ∈  □  A  ⇒  y  ∈  A  )      fragments  for-all  A   V   fragments  normal-(  x   □  A  normal-⇒  y   A  normal-)     \forall A\in V\,(x\in\Box A\Rightarrow y\in A)   implies     x    R   y      x  R  y    x\,R\,y   ,  compact , if every subset of V with the finite intersection property has a non-empty intersection,  atomic , if V contains all singletons,  refined , if it is differentiated and tight,  descriptive , if it is refined and compact.   Kripke frames are refined and atomic. However, infinite Kripke frames are never compact. Every finite differentiated or atomic frame is a Kripke frame.  Descriptive frames are the most important class of frames because of the duality theory (see below). Refined frames are useful as a common generalization of descriptive and Kripke frames.  Operations and morphisms on frames  Every Kripke model    ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  ⊩  ⟩     F  R  forces    \langle F,R,{\Vdash}\rangle    induces the general frame    ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩     F  R  V    \langle F,R,V\rangle   , where V is defined as      V  =   {   {  x  ∈  F  ;  x  ⊩  A  }   ;  A  is a formula  }   .     fragments  V    fragments  normal-{   fragments  normal-{  x   F  normal-;  x  forces  A  normal-}   normal-;  A  is a formula  normal-}   normal-.    V=\big\{\{x\in F;\,x\Vdash A\};\,A\hbox{ is a formula}\big\}.     The fundamental truth-preserving operations of generated subframes, p-morphic images, and disjoint unions of Kripke frames have analogues on general frames. A frame    𝐆  =   ⟨  G  ,  S  ,  W  ⟩       𝐆   G  S  W     \mathbf{G}=\langle G,S,W\rangle   is a generated subframe of a frame    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F  R  V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,R,V\rangle   , if the Kripke frame    ⟨  G  ,  S  ⟩     G  S    \langle G,S\rangle   is a generated subframe of the Kripke frame    ⟨  F  ,  R  ⟩     F  R    \langle F,R\rangle   (i.e., G is a subset of F closed upwards under R , and S is the restriction of R to G ), and      W  =   {  A  ∩  G  ;  A  ∈  V  }   .     fragments  W    fragments  normal-{  A   G  normal-;  A   V  normal-}   normal-.    W=\{A\cap G;\,A\in V\}.   A p-morphism (or bounded morphism )    f  :   𝐅  →  𝐆      normal-:  f   normal-→  𝐅  𝐆     f\colon\mathbf{F}\to\mathbf{G}   is a function from F to G which is a p-morphism of the Kripke frames    ⟨  F  ,  R  ⟩     F  R    \langle F,R\rangle   and    ⟨  G  ,  S  ⟩     G  S    \langle G,S\rangle   , and satisfies the additional constraint        f   -  1     [  A  ]    ∈  V         superscript  f    1     delimited-[]  A    V    f^{-1}[A]\in V   for every    A  ∈  W      A  W    A\in W   . The disjoint union of an indexed set of frames     𝐅  i   =   ⟨   F  i   ,   R  i   ,   V  i   ⟩        subscript  𝐅  i     subscript  F  i    subscript  R  i    subscript  V  i      \mathbf{F}_{i}=\langle F_{i},R_{i},V_{i}\rangle   ,    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   , is the frame    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F  R  V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,R,V\rangle   , where F is the disjoint union of    {     F  i   ;  i   ∈  I   }         subscript  F  i   i   I     \{F_{i};\,i\in I\}   , R is the union of    {     R  i   ;  i   ∈  I   }         subscript  R  i   i   I     \{R_{i};\,i\in I\}   , and      V  =   {  A  ⊆  F  ;  ∀  i  ∈   I    (  A  ∩   F  i   ∈   V  i   )   }   .     fragments  V    fragments  normal-{  A   F  normal-;  for-all  i   I   fragments  normal-(  A    subscript  F  i     subscript  V  i   normal-)   normal-}   normal-.    V=\{A\subseteq F;\,\forall i\in I\,(A\cap F_{i}\in V_{i})\}.     The refinement of a frame    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F  R  V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,R,V\rangle   is a refined frame    𝐆  =   ⟨  G  ,  S  ,  W  ⟩       𝐆   G  S  W     \mathbf{G}=\langle G,S,W\rangle   defined as follows. We consider the equivalence relation      x  ∼  y  ⇔  ∀  A  ∈   V    (  x  ∈  A  ⇔  y  ∈  A  )   ,     fragments  x  similar-to  y  iff  for-all  A   V   fragments  normal-(  x   A  normal-⇔  y   A  normal-)   normal-,    x\sim y\iff\forall A\in V\,(x\in A\Leftrightarrow y\in A),   and let    G  =  F  /  ∼     fragments  G   F   similar-to    G=F/{\sim}   be the set of equivalence classes of   ∼   similar-to   \sim   . Then we put       ⟨  x  /  ∼  ,  y  /  ∼  ⟩   ∈  S  ⇔  ∀  A  ∈   V    (  x  ∈  □  A  ⇒  y  ∈  A  )   ,     fragments   fragments  normal-⟨  x   similar-to  normal-,  y   similar-to  normal-⟩    S  iff  for-all  A   V   fragments  normal-(  x   □  A  normal-⇒  y   A  normal-)   normal-,    \langle x/{\sim},y/{\sim}\rangle\in S\iff\forall A\in V\,(x\in\Box A%
 \Rightarrow y\in A),         A  /  ∼  ∈  W  ⇔  A  ∈  V  .     fragments  A   similar-to   W  iff  A   V  normal-.    A/{\sim}\in W\iff A\in V.     Completeness  Unlike Kripke frames, every normal modal logic L is complete with respect to a class of general frames. This is a consequence of the fact that L is complete with respect to a class of Kripke models    ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  ⊩  ⟩     F  R  forces    \langle F,R,{\Vdash}\rangle   : as L is closed under substitution, the general frame induced by    ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  ⊩  ⟩     F  R  forces    \langle F,R,{\Vdash}\rangle   is an L -frame. Moreover, every logic L is complete with respect to a single descriptive frame. Indeed, L is complete with respect to its canonical model, and the general frame induced by the canonical model (called the canonical frame of L ) is descriptive.  Jónsson–Tarski duality  General frames bear close connection to modal algebras . Let    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F  R  V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,R,V\rangle   be a general frame. The set V is closed under Boolean operations, therefore it is a subalgebra of the power set Boolean algebra     ⟨   𝒫   (  F  )    ,  ∩  ,  ∪  ,  -  ⟩       𝒫  F        \langle\mathcal{P}(F),\cap,\cup,-\rangle   . It also carries an additional unary operation,   □   normal-□   \Box   . The combined structure    ⟨  V  ,  ∩  ,  ∪  ,  -  ,  □  ⟩     V     normal-□    \langle V,\cap,\cup,-,\Box\rangle   is a modal algebra, which is called the dual algebra of F , and denoted by    𝐅  +     superscript  𝐅     \mathbf{F}^{+}   .  In the opposite direction, it is possible to construct the dual frame      𝐀  +   =   ⟨  F  ,  R  ,  V  ⟩        subscript  𝐀     F  R  V     \mathbf{A}_{+}=\langle F,R,V\rangle   to any modal algebra    𝐀  =   ⟨  A  ,  ∧  ,  ∨  ,  -  ,  □  ⟩       𝐀   A     normal-□     \mathbf{A}=\langle A,\wedge,\vee,-,\Box\rangle   . The Boolean algebra    ⟨  A  ,  ∧  ,  ∨  ,  -  ⟩     A       \langle A,\wedge,\vee,-\rangle   has a Stone space , whose underlying set F is the set of all ultrafilters of A . The set V of admissible valuations in    𝐀  +     subscript  𝐀     \mathbf{A}_{+}   consists of the clopen subsets of F , and the accessibility relation R is defined by       x    R   y  ⇔  ∀  a  ∈   A    (  □  a  ∈  x  ⇒  a  ∈  y  )      fragments  x  R  y  iff  for-all  a   A   fragments  normal-(  □  a   x  normal-⇒  a   y  normal-)     x\,R\,y\iff\forall a\in A\,(\Box a\in x\Rightarrow a\in y)   for all ultrafilters x and y .  A frame and its dual validate the same formulas, hence the general frame semantics and algebraic semantics are in a sense equivalent. The double dual     (   𝐀  +   )   +     superscript   subscript  𝐀       (\mathbf{A}_{+})^{+}   of any modal algebra is isomorphic to   𝐀   𝐀   \mathbf{A}   itself. This is not true in general for double duals of frames, as the dual of every algebra is descriptive. In fact, a frame   𝐅   𝐅   \mathbf{F}   is descriptive if and only if it is isomorphic to its double dual     (   𝐅  +   )   +     subscript   superscript  𝐅       (\mathbf{F}^{+})_{+}   .  It is also possible to define duals of p-morphisms on one hand, and modal algebra homomorphisms on the other hand. In this way the operators     (  ⋅  )   +     superscript  normal-⋅     (\cdot)^{+}   and     (  ⋅  )   +     subscript  normal-⋅     (\cdot)_{+}   become a pair of contravariant functors between the category of general frames, and the category of modal algebras. These functors provide a duality (called Jónsson–Tarski duality after Bjarni Jónsson and Alfred Tarski ) between the categories of descriptive frames, and modal algebras.  Intuitionistic frames  The frame semantics for intuitionistic and intermediate logics can be developed in parallel to the semantics for modal logics. An intuitionistic general frame is a triple    ⟨  F  ,  ≤  ,  V  ⟩     F   V    \langle F,\leq,V\rangle   , where   ≤     \leq   is a partial order on F , and V is a set of upper subsets ( cones ) of F which contains the empty set, and is closed under   intersection and union,  the operation    A  →  B  =   □   (    -  A   ∪  B   )         normal-→  A  B         normal-□      A   B       A\to B=\Box(-A\cup B)   .   Validity and other concepts are then introduced similarly to modal frames, with a few changes necessary to accommodate for the weaker closure properties of the set of admissible valuations. In particular, an intuitionistic frame    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  ≤  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F   V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,\leq,V\rangle   is called   tight , if    ∀  A  ∈   V    (  x  ∈  A  ⇔  y  ∈  A  )      fragments  for-all  A   V   fragments  normal-(  x   A  normal-⇔  y   A  normal-)     \forall A\in V\,(x\in A\Leftrightarrow y\in A)   implies    x  ≤  y      x  y    x\leq y   ,  compact , if every subset of    V  ∪   {  F  -  A  ;  A  ∈  V  }      fragments  V    fragments  normal-{  F   A  normal-;  A   V  normal-}     V\cup\{F-A;\,A\in V\}   with the finite intersection property has a non-empty intersection.   Tight intuitionistic frames are automatically differentiated, hence refined.  The dual of an intuitionistic frame    𝐅  =   ⟨  F  ,  ≤  ,  V  ⟩       𝐅   F   V     \mathbf{F}=\langle F,\leq,V\rangle   is the Heyting algebra      𝐅  +   =   ⟨  V  ,  ∩  ,  ∪  ,  →  ,  ∅  ⟩        superscript  𝐅     V    normal-→      \mathbf{F}^{+}=\langle V,\cap,\cup,\to,\emptyset\rangle   . The dual of a Heyting algebra    𝐀  =   ⟨  A  ,  ∧  ,  ∨  ,  →  ,  0  ⟩       𝐀   A    normal-→  0     \mathbf{A}=\langle A,\wedge,\vee,\to,0\rangle   is the intuitionistic frame     𝐀  +   =   ⟨  F  ,  ≤  ,  V  ⟩        subscript  𝐀     F   V     \mathbf{A}_{+}=\langle F,\leq,V\rangle   , where F is the set of all prime filters of A , the ordering   ≤     \leq   is inclusion , and V consists of all subsets of F of the form       {    x  ∈  F   ;   a  ∈  x    }   ,      formulae-sequence    x  F     a  x      \{x\in F;\,a\in x\},   where    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   . As in the modal case,     (  ⋅  )   +     superscript  normal-⋅     (\cdot)^{+}   and     (  ⋅  )   +     subscript  normal-⋅     (\cdot)_{+}   are a pair of contravariant functors, which make the category of Heyting algebras dually equivalent to the category of descriptive intuitionistic frames.  It is possible to construct intuitionistic general frames from transitive reflexive modal frames and vice versa, see modal companion .
