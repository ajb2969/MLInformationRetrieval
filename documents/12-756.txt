   Minnaert resonance      Minnaert resonance   The Minnaert resonance 1 is the acoustic  resonance frequency of a single bubble in an infinite domain of water (neglecting the effects of surface tension and viscous  attenuation ). The resonant frequency is given by      f  =    1   2  π  a      (    3   γ    p  A    ρ   )    1  /  2         f     continued-fraction  1    2  π  a     superscript   continued-fraction    3  γ   subscript  p  A    ρ     1  2       f=\cfrac{1}{2\pi a}\left(\cfrac{3\gamma~{}p_{A}}{\rho}\right)^{1/2}   where   a   a   a   is the radius of the bubble,   γ   γ   \gamma   is the polytropic coefficient,    p  A     subscript  p  A    p_{A}   is the ambient pressure, and   ρ   ρ   \rho   is the density of water. This formula can also be used to find the resonant frequency of a bubble cloud with   a   a   a   as the radius of the cloud and   ρ   ρ   \rho   the difference between the density of water and the bulk density of the cloud. For a bubble in water at standard pressure    (     p  A   =    100   kPa    ,   ρ  =     1000   kg   /   m  3      )     formulae-sequence     subscript  p  A     100  kPa      ρ      1000  kg    superscript  normal-m  3       (p_{A}=100~{}{\rm kPa},~{}\rho=1000~{}{\rm kg/m^{3}})   , this equation reduces to     f  a   ≈     3.26   m   /  s         f  a       3.26  normal-m   normal-s     fa\approx 3.26~{}\rm m/s   , where    f    f   f~{}   is the resonant frequency of the bubble.
