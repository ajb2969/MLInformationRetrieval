Minnaert resonance

The Minnaert resonance1 is the acoustic resonance frequency of a single bubble in an infinite domain of water (neglecting the effects of surface tension and viscous attenuation). The resonant frequency is given by


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the radius of the bubble, 
 
 
 
  is the polytropic coefficient, 
 
 
 
  is the ambient pressure, and 
 
 
 
  is the density of water. This formula can also be used to find the resonant frequency of a bubble cloud with 
 
 
 
  as the radius of the cloud and 
 
 
 
  the difference between the density of water and the bulk density of the cloud. For a bubble in water at standard pressure 
 
 
 
 , this equation reduces to 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the resonant frequency of the bubble.
