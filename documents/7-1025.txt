Homotopy extension property

In mathematics, in the area of algebraic topology, the homotopy extension property indicates which homotopies defined on a subspace can be extended to a homotopy defined on a larger space.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological space, and let 
 
 
 
 . We say that the pair 
 
 
 
  has the homotopy extension property if, given a homotopy 
 
 
 
 
  and a map 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , there exists an extension of 
 
 
 
  to a homotopy 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 . 1
That is, the pair 
 
 
 
  has the homotopy extension property if any map 
 
 
 
  can be extended to a map 
 
 
 
  (i.e. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  agree on their common domain).
If the pair has this property only for a certain codomain

 
 , we say that 
 
 
 
  has the homotopy extension property with respect to 
 
 
 
 .
Visualisation
The homotopy extension property is depicted in the following diagram
(Figure)

If the above diagram (without the dashed map) commutes, which is equivalent to the conditions above, then there exists a map 
 
 
 
  which makes the diagram commute. By currying, note that a map 
 
 
 
 
  is the same as a map 
 
 
 
 .
Also compare this to the visualization of the homotopy lifting property.
Properties

If 
 
 
 
  is a cell complex and 
 
 
 
  is a subcomplex of 
 
 
 
 , then the pair 
 
 
 
 
  has the homotopy extension property.


A pair 
 
 
 
  has the homotopy extension property if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a retract of 
 
 


Other
If 
 
 
 
  has the homotopy extension property, then the simple inclusion map 
 
 
 
 
  is a cofibration.
In fact, if you consider any cofibration

 
 , then we have that 
 
 
 
  is homeomorphic to its image under 
 
 
 
 . This implies that any cofibration can be treated as an inclusion map, and therefore it can be treated as having the homotopy extension property.
