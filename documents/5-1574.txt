   Conservative extension      Conservative extension   In mathematical logic , a logical theory     T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   is a ( proof theoretic ) conservative extension of a theory    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   if the language of    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   extends the language of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   ; every theorem of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   is a theorem of    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   ; and any theorem of    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   that is in the language of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   is already a theorem of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   .  More generally, if Γ is a set of formulas in the common language of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   , then    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   is Γ-conservative over    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   if every formula from Γ provable in    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   is also provable in    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   .  To put it informally, the new theory may possibly be more convenient for proving theorems , but it proves no new theorems about the language of the old theory.  Note that a conservative extension of a consistent theory is consistent. [If it were not, then by the principle of explosion ("everything follows from a contradiction"), every theorem in the original theory as well as its negation would belong to the new theory, which then would not be a conservative extension.] Hence, conservative extensions do not bear the risk of introducing new inconsistencies. This can also be seen as a methodology for writing and structuring large theories: start with a theory,    T  0     subscript  T  0    T_{0}   , that is known (or assumed) to be consistent, and successively build conservative extensions    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   ,    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   , ... of it.  The theorem provers Isabelle and ACL2 adopt this methodology by providing a language for conservative extensions by definition.  Recently, conservative extensions have been used for defining a notion of module for ontologies : if an ontology is formalized as a logical theory, a subtheory is a module if the whole ontology is a conservative extension of the subtheory.  An extension which is not conservative may be called a proper extension .  Examples   ACA 0 (a subsystem of second-order arithmetic ) is a conservative extension of first-order Peano arithmetic .  Von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel set theory is a conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).  Internal set theory is a conservative extension of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice (ZFC).  Extensions by definitions are conservative.  Extensions by unconstrained predicate or function symbols are conservative.  IΣ 1 (a subsystem of Peano arithmetic with induction only for Σ 0 1 -formulas ) is a Π 0 2 -conservative extension of the primitive recursive arithmetic (PRA). 1  ZFC is a Π 1 3 -conservative extension of ZF by Shoenfield's absoluteness theorem .  ZFC with the continuum hypothesis is a Π 2 1 -conservative extension of ZFC.   Model-theoretic conservative extension  With model-theoretic means, a stronger notion is obtained: an extension    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   of a theory    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   is model-theoretically conservative if every model of    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   can be expanded to a model of    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   . It is straightforward to see that each model-theoretic conservative extension also is a (proof-theoretic) conservative extension in the above sense. The model theoretic notion has the advantage over the proof theoretic one that it does not depend so much on the language at hand; on the other hand, it is usually harder to establish model theoretic conservativity.
