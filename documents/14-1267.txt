An example of a graph

In computer science the notion of highly connected subgraphs appears frequently. This notion can be formalized as follows. Let 
 
 
 
  be an undirected graph and let 
 
 
 
  be a subgraph of 
 
 
 
 . Then the density of 
 
 
 
  is defined to be 
 
 
 
 .
The densest subgraph problem is that of finding a subgraph of maximum density. In 1984, Andrew V. Goldberg developed a polynomial time algorithm to find the maximum density subgraph using a max flow technique.
Densest 
 
 
 
  subgraph
There are many variations on the densest subgraph problem. One of them is the densest 
 
 
 
  subgraph problem, where the objective is to find the maximum density subgraph on exactly 
 
 
 
  vertices. This problem generalizes the clique problem and is thus NP-hard in general graphs. There exists a polynomial algorithm approximating the densest 
 
 
 
  subgraph within a ratio of 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 ,1 while it does not admit PTAS unless 
 
 
 
 .2 The problem remains NP-hard in bipartite graphs and chordal graphs but is polynomial for trees and split graphs.3 It is open whether the problem is NP-hard or polynomial in (proper) interval graphs and planar graphs (notice that the connected version of the problem remains NP-hard in planar graphs 4).
Densest at most 
 
 
 
  subgraph
The objective of the densest at most 
 
 
 
  problem is to find the maximum density subgraph on at most 
 
 
 
  vertices. Anderson and Chellapilla showed that if there exists an 
 
 
 
  approximation for this problem then that will lead to an 
 
 
 
  approximation for the densest 
 
 
 
  subgraph problem.
Densest at least 
 
 
 
  subgraph
The densest at least 
 
 
 
  problem is defined similarly to the densest at most 
 
 
 
  subgraph problem. There is a 2-approximation due to Anderson. It is also NP-complete.5
