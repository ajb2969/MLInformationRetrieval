   Dense subgraph      Dense subgraph   (Figure)  An example of a graph   G   G   G   with density     d  G   =  1.375       subscript  d  G   1.375    d_{G}=1.375   and it's densest subgraph induced by the vertices    b  ,  c  ,  d  ,  e     b  c  d  e    b,c,d,e   and   h   h   h   in red with density   1.4   1.4   1.4      In computer science the notion of highly connected subgraphs appears frequently. This notion can be formalized as follows. Let    G  =   (  E  ,  V  )       G   E  V     G=(E,V)   be an undirected graph and let    S  =   (   E  S   ,   V  S   )       S    subscript  E  S    subscript  V  S      S=(E_{S},V_{S})   be a subgraph of   G   G   G   . Then the density of   S   S   S   is defined to be     d  S   =    |   E  S   |    |   V  S   |         subscript  d  S        subscript  E  S       subscript  V  S       d_{S}={|E_{S}|\over|V_{S}|}   .  The densest subgraph problem is that of finding a subgraph of maximum density. In 1984, Andrew V. Goldberg developed a polynomial time algorithm to find the maximum density subgraph using a max flow technique.  Densest   k   k   k   subgraph  There are many variations on the densest subgraph problem. One of them is the densest   k   k   k   subgraph problem, where the objective is to find the maximum density subgraph on exactly   k   k   k   vertices. This problem generalizes the clique problem and is thus NP-hard in general graphs. There exists a polynomial algorithm approximating the densest   k   k   k   subgraph within a ratio of    n    1  /  4   +  ϵ      superscript  n      1  4   ϵ     n^{1/4+\epsilon}   for every    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   , 1 while it does not admit PTAS unless    P  =   N  P       P    N  P     P=NP   . 2 The problem remains NP-hard in bipartite graphs and chordal graphs but is polynomial for trees and split graphs . 3 It is open whether the problem is NP-hard or polynomial in (proper) interval graphs and planar graphs (notice that the connected version of the problem remains NP-hard in planar graphs 4 ).  Densest at most   k   k   k   subgraph  The objective of the densest at most   k   k   k   problem is to find the maximum density subgraph on at most   k   k   k   vertices. Anderson and Chellapilla showed that if there exists an   α   α   \alpha   approximation for this problem then that will lead to an    Θ   (   α  2   )       normal-Θ   superscript  α  2     \Theta(\alpha^{2})   approximation for the densest   k   k   k   subgraph problem.  Densest at least   k   k   k   subgraph  The densest at least   k   k   k   problem is defined similarly to the densest at most   k   k   k   subgraph problem. There is a 2-approximation due to Anderson. It is also NP-complete. 5  References    .   .   .   .   .   .   .
