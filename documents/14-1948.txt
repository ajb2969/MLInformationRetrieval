   Taylor's law      Taylor's law   Taylor's law (also known as Taylor’s power law ) is an empirical law in ecology that relates the variance of the number of individuals of a species per unit area of habitat to the corresponding mean by a power law relationship. 1  Definition  This law was originally defined for ecological systems, specifically to assess the spatial clustering of organisms. For a population count Y with mean µ and variance var( Y ), Taylor’s law is written,        var    (  Y  )    =   a   μ  b          var  Y     a   superscript  μ  b      \text{var}\,(Y)=a\mu^{b}   ,  where a and b are both positive constants. Taylor proposed this relationship in 1961, suggesting that the exponent b be considered a species specific index of aggregation. 2 This power law has subsequently been confirmed for many hundreds of species. 3 4  Taylor’s law has also been applied to assess the time dependent changes of population distributions. 5 Related variance to mean power laws have also been demonstrated in several non-ecological systems:   cancer metastasis 6  the numbers of houses built over the Tonami plain in Japan. 7  measles epidemiology 8  HIV epidemiology, 9  the geographic clustering of childhood leukemia 10  blood flow heterogeneity 11 12  the genomic distributions of single- nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) 13  gene structures 14  in number theory with sequential values of the Mertens function 15 and also with the distribution of prime numbers  16  from the eigenvalue deviations of Gaussian orthogonal and unitary ensembles of random matrix theory 17   History  Much controversy has surrounded Taylor’s law.  Barlett proposed a relationship between the sample mean and variance in 1936 18      s  2   =    a  m   +   b   m  2          superscript  s  2       a  m     b   superscript  m  2       s^{2}=am+bm^{2}     Smith in 1938 while studying crop yields proposed a relationship similar to Taylor's. 19 This relationship was       log   V  x    =    log   V  1    +   b   log   x             subscript  V  x         subscript  V  1      b    x       \log V_{x}=\log V_{1}+b\log x\,     where V x is the variance of yield for plots of x units, V 1 is the variance of yield per unit area and x is the size of plots. The slope ( b ) is the index of heterogeneity. The value of b in this relationship lies between 0 and 1. Where the yield are highly correlated b tends to 0; when they are uncorrelated b tends to 1.  Bliss 20 in 1941, Fracker and Brischle 21 in 1941 and Hayman & Lowe 22 in 1961 also described what is now known as Taylor's law, but in the context of data from single species.  L.R. Taylor (1924–2007) was an English entomologist who worked on the Rothamsted Insect Survey for pest control. His 1961 paper used data from 24 papers published between 1936 and 1960. These papers considered a variety of biological settings: virus lesions, macro-zooplankton , worms and symphylids in soil , insects in soil, on plants and in the air, mites on leaves , ticks on sheep and fish in the sea . 23 In these papers the b value lay between 1 and 3. Taylor proposed the power law as a general feature of the spatial distribution of these species. He also proposed a mechanistic hypothesis to explain this law. Among the papers cited were those of Bliss and Yates and Finney.  Initial attempts to explain the spatial distribution of animals had been based on approaches like Bartlett’s stochastic population models and the negative binomial distribution that could result from birth-death processes . 24 Taylor’s novel explanation was based the assumption of a balanced migratory and congregatory behavior of animals. 25 His hypothesis was initially qualitative, but as it evolved it became semi-quantitative and was supported by simulations. 26 In proposing that animal behavior was the principal mechanism behind the clustering of organisms, Taylor though appeared to have ignored his own report of clustering seen with tobacco necrosis virus plaques. 27  Following Taylor’s initial publications several alternative hypotheses for the power law were advanced. Hanski proposed a random walk model, modulated by the presumed multiplicative effect of reproduction. 28 Hanski’s model predicted that the power law exponent would be constrained to range closely about the value of 2, which seemed inconsistent with many reported values. 29 30  Anderson et al formulated a simple stochastic birth, death, immigration and emigration model that yielded a quadratic variance function. 31 As a response to this model Taylor argued that such a Markov process would predict that the power law exponent would vary considerably between replicate observations, and that such variability had not been observed. 32  About this time concerns were, however, raised regarding the statistical variability with measurements of the power law exponent, and the possibility that observations of a power law might reflect more mathematical artefact than a mechanistic process. 33 Taylor et al responded with an additional publication of extensive observations which he claimed refuted Downing’s concerns. 34  In addition, Thórarinsson published a detailed critique of the animal behavioral model, noting that Taylor had modified his model several times in response to concerns raised, and that some of these modifications were inconsistent with earlier versions. 35 Thórarinsson also claimed that Taylor confounded animal numbers with density and that Taylor had incorrectly interpreted simulations that had been constructed to demonstrate his models as validation.  Kemp reviewed a number of discrete stochastic models based on the negative binomial, Neyman type A, and Polya-Aeppli distributions that with suitable adjustment of parameters could produce a variance to mean power law. 36 Kemp, however, did not explain the parameterizations of his models in mechanistic terms. Other relatively abstract models for Taylor’s law followed. 37 38  A number of additional statistical concerns were raised regarding Taylor’s law, based on the difficulty with real data in distinguishing between Taylor’s law and other variance to mean functions, as well the inaccuracy of standard regression methods. 39 40  Reports also began to accumulate where Taylor’s law had been applied to time series data. Perry showed how simulations based on chaos theory could yield Taylor’s law, and Kilpatrick & Ives provided simulations which showed how interactions between different species might lead to Taylor's law. 41 42  Other reports appeared where Taylor’s law had been applied to the spatial distribution of plants 43 and bacterial populations 44 As with the observations of Tobacco necrosis virus mentioned earlier, these observations were not consistent with Taylor’s animal behavioral model.  Earlier it was mentioned that variance to mean power function had been applied to non-ecological systems, under the rubric of Taylor’s law. To provide a more general explanation for the range of manifestations of the power law a hypothesis was proposed based on the Tweedie distributions , 45 a family of probabilistic models that express an inherent power function relationship between the variance and the mean. 46 47 48 Details regarding this hypothesis will be provided in the next section.  A further alternative explanation for Taylor's law was proposed by Cohen  et al , derived from the Lewontin Cohen growth model . 49 This model was successfully used to describe the spatial and temporal variability of forest populations.  In the physics literature Taylor’s law has been referred to as ﬂuctuation scaling . Eisler et al , in a further attempt to find a general explanation for fluctuation scaling, proposed a process they called impact inhomogeneity in which frequent events are associated with larger impacts. 50 In appendix B of the Eisler article, however, the authors noted that the equations for impact inhomogeneity yielded the same mathematical relationships as found with the Tweedie distributions.  Another group of physicists, Fronczak and Fronczak, derived Taylor’s power law for fluctuation scaling from principles of equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical physics . 51 Their derivation was based on assumptions of physical quantities like free energy and an external field that caused the clustering of biological organisms. Direct experimental demonstration of these postulated physical quantities in relationship to animal or plant aggregation has yet to be achieved, though. Shortly thereafter, an analysis of Fronczak and Fronczak’s model was presented that showed their equations directly lead to the Tweedie distributions, a finding that suggested that Fronczak and Fronczak had possibly provided a maximum entropy derivation of these distributions. 52  The Tweedie Hypothesis  About the time that Taylor was substantiating his ecological observations, MCK Tweedie , a British statistician and medical physicist, was investigating a family of probabilistic models that are now known as the Tweedie distributions . 53 54 As mentioned above, these distributions are all characterized by a variance to mean power law mathematically identical to Taylor’s law.  The Tweedie distribution most applicable to ecological observations is the compound Poisson-gamma distribution , which represents the sum of N independent and identically distributed random variables with a gamma distribution where N is a random variable distributed in accordance with a Poisson distribution. In the additive form its cumulant generating function (CGF) is:        K  b  *    (  s  ;  θ  ,  λ  )    =   λ   κ  b    (  θ  )    [     (   1  +   s  θ    )   α   -  1   ]           subscript   superscript  K    b    s  θ  λ      λ   subscript  κ  b   θ   delimited-[]     superscript    1    s  θ    α   1       K^{*}_{b}(s;\theta,\lambda)=\lambda\kappa_{b}(\theta)\left[\left(1+{s\over%
 \theta}\right)^{\alpha}-1\right]   ,  where κ b ( θ ) is the cumulant function,        κ  b    (  θ  )    =     (   α  -  1   )   α     (   θ   (   α  -  1   )    )   α           subscript  κ  b   θ         α  1   α    superscript    θ    α  1    α      \kappa_{b}(\theta)={(\alpha-1)\over\alpha}\left({\theta\over(\alpha-1)}\right)%
 ^{\alpha}   ,  the Tweedie exponent      α  =    (   b  -  2   )   /   (   b  -  1   )        α      b  2     b  1      \alpha=(b-2)/(b-1)   ,  s is the generating function variable, and θ and λ are the canonical and index parameters, respectively. 55  These last two parameters are analogous to the scale and shape parameters used in probability theory. The cumulants of this distribution can be determined by successive differentiations of the CGF and then substituting s=0 into the resultant equations. The first and second cumulants are the mean and variance, respectively, and thus the compound Poisson-gamma CGF yields Taylor’s law with the proportionality constant      a  =   λ   1  /   (   α  -  1   )         a   superscript  λ    1    α  1       a=\lambda^{1/(\alpha-1)}   .  The compound Poisson-gamma cumulative distribution function has been verified for limited ecological data through the comparison of the theoretical distribution function with the empirical distribution function. 56 A number of other systems, demonstrating variance to mean power laws related to Taylor’s law, have been similarly tested for the compound Poisson-gamma distribution. 57 58 59 60  The main justification for the Tweedie hypothesis rests with the mathematical convergence properties of the Tweedie distributions. 61 The Tweedie convergence theorem requires the Tweedie distributions to act as foci of convergence for a wide range of statistical processes. 62 As a consequence of this convergence theorem, processes based on the sum of multiple independent small jumps will tend to express Taylor’s law and obey a Tweedie distribution. A limit theorem for independent and identically distributed variables, as with the Tweedie convergence theorem, might then be considered as being fundamental relative to the ad hoc population models, or models proposed on the basis of simulation or approximation. 63 64  This hypothesis remains controversial; more conventional population dynamic approaches seem preferred amongst ecologists, despite the fact that the Tweedie compound Poisson distribution can be directly applied to population dynamic mechanisms. 65  One difficulty with the Tweedie hypothesis is that the value of b must be greater than 1.

J Aust Entomol Soc 21: 175-181  Naming of law  The law itself is named after the ecologist Lionel Roy Taylor (1924–2007). The name 'Taylor's law' was coined by Southwood in 1966. 66 Taylor's original name for this relationship was the law of the mean.  Mathematical formulation  In symbols       s  i  2   =   a   m  i  b         superscript   subscript  s  i   2     a   superscript   subscript  m  i   b      s_{i}^{2}=am_{i}^{b}   ,  where s i 2 is the variance of the density of the i th sample, m i is the mean density of the i th sample and a and b are constants.  In logarithmic form       log   s  i  2    =    log  a   +   b   log   m  i             superscript   subscript  s  i   2        a     b     subscript  m  i        \log s_{i}^{2}=\log a+b\log m_{i}     Scale invariance  Taylor's law is scale invariant. If the unit of measurement is changed by a constant factor c , the exponent ( b ) remains unchanged.  To see this let y = cx .

Ordinary least squares regression assumes that φ = ∞. This tends to underestimate the value of b because the estimates of both log( s 2 ) and log m are subject to error.  An extension of Taylor's law has been proposed by Ferris et al when multiple samples are taken 69       s  2   =    (   c   n  d    )    (   m  b   )         superscript  s  2       c   superscript  n  d     superscript  m  b      s^{2}=(cn^{d})(m^{b})   ,  where s 2 and m are the variance and mean respectively, b , c and d are constants and n is the number of samples taken. To date, this proposed extension has not been verified to be as applicable as the original version of Taylor's law.  Small samples  An extension to this law for small samples has been proposed by Hanski. 70 For small samples the Poisson variation ( P ) - the variation that can be ascribed to sampling variation - may be significant. Let S be the total variance and let V be the biological (real) variance. Then      S  =   V  +  P       S    V  P     S=V+P     Assuming the validity of Taylor's law, we have      V  =   a   m  b        V    a   superscript  m  b      V=am^{b}     Because in the Poisson distribution the mean equals the variance, we have      P  =  m      P  m    P=m     This gives us      S  =   V  +  P   =    a   m  b    +  m         S    V  P            a   superscript  m  b    m      S=V+P=am^{b}+m     This closely resembles Barlett's original suggestion.  Interpretation  Slope values ( b ) significantly > 1 indicate clumping of the organisms.  In Poisson-distributed data, b = 1. 71 If the population follows a lognormal or gamma distribution , then b = 2.  For populations that are experiencing constant per capita environmental variability, the regression of log( variance ) versus log( mean abundance ) should have a line with b = 2.  Most populations that have been studied have b Boag B, Hackett CA, Topham PB (1992) The use of Taylor's power law to describe the aggregated distribution of gastro-intestinal nematodes of sheep. Int J Parasitol 22(3):267–270 Occasionally cases with b > 2 have been reported. 72  b values below 1 are uncommon but have also been reported ( b = 0.93 ). 73  It has been suggested that the exponent of the law ( b ) is proportional to the skewness of the underlying distribution. 74 This proposal has criticised: additional work seems to be indicated. 75 76  Notes  The origin of the slope ( b ) in this regression remains unclear. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain it. One suggests that b arises from the species behavior and is a constant for that species. The alternative suggests that it is dependent on the sampled population. Despite the considerable number of studies carried out on this law (over 1000), this question remains open.  It is known that both a and b are subject to change due to age-specific dispersal, mortality and sample unit size. 77  This law may be a poor fit if the values are small. For this reason an extension to Taylor's law has been proposed by Hanski which improves the fit of Taylor's law at low densities. 78  Extension to binary sampling  Binomial sampling is popular where there are large number of units (crops, trees) to be examined and where counts of individuals of interest (typically insects) may be difficult (frequently because the insects fly away before they can be accurately counted).  A form of Taylor's law applicable to binary sampling (presence/absence of at least one individual in a sample unit) has been proposed. 79 In a binomial distribution, the theoretical variance is       s  2   =   n  p   (   1  -  p   )         superscript  s  2     n  p    1  p      s^{2}=np(1-p)   ,  where s 2 is the variance, n is the sample size and p is the proportion of sample units with at least one individual. The proposed binary form of Taylor's law is       v  a   r   o  b  s     =    log   (  a  )    +   b   log   (   v  a   r   b  i  n     )            v  a   subscript  r    o  b  s         a     b      v  a   subscript  r    b  i  n          var_{obs}=\log(a)+b\log(var_{bin})   ,  where var obs is the observed variance and var bin is that expected from the binomial distribution. When both a and b are equal to 1, then a random spatial pattern is suggested and is best described by the binomial distribution. When b = 1 and a > 1, there is over-dispersion with no dependence on the mean incidence ( p ). When both a and b are > 1, the degree of aggregation varies with p .  Applications  Because of the ubiquitous occurrence of Taylor's law in biology it has found a variety of uses some of which are listed here.  Recommendations as to use  It has been recommended based on simulation studies 80 in applications testing the validity of Taylor's law to a data sample that:  (1) the total number of organisms studied be > 15 (2) the minimum number of groups of organisms studied be > 5 (3) the density of the organisms should vary by at least 2 orders of magnitude within the sample  Randomly distributed populations  It is common assumed (at least initially) that a population is randomly distributed in the environment. If a population is randomly distributed then the mean ( m ) and variance ( s 2 ) of the population are equal and the proportion of samples that contain at least one individual ( p ) is      p  =   1  -   e   -  m         p    1   superscript  e    m       p=1-e^{-m}     When a species with a clumped pattern is compared with one that is randomly distributed with equal overall densities, p will be less for the species having the clumped distribution pattern. Conversely when comparing a uniformly and a randomly distributed species but at equal overall densities, p will be greater for the randomly distributed population. This can be graphically tested by plotting p against m .  Wilson and Room developed a binomial model that incorporates Taylor's law. 81 The basic relationship is      p  =   1  -   e   -   m   log   (    s  2   /  m   )      (     s  2   /  m   -  1   )    -  1            p    1   superscript  e      m       superscript  s  2   m     superscript       superscript  s  2   m   1     1          p=1-e^{-m\log(s^{2}/m)(s^{2}/m-1)^{-1}}     where the log is taken to the base e .  Incorporating Taylor's law this relationship becomes      p  =   1  -   e   -   m   log   (   a   m   b  -  1     )      (    a   m   b  -  1     -  1   )    -  1            p    1   superscript  e      m      a   superscript  m    b  1       superscript      a   superscript  m    b  1     1     1          p=1-e^{-m\log(am^{b-1})(am^{b-1}-1)^{-1}}     Dispersion parameter estimator  The common dispersion parameter ( k ) of the negative binomial distribution is      k  =    m  2   /   (    s  2   -  m   )        k     superscript  m  2      superscript  s  2   m      k=m^{2}/(s^{2}-m)     where m is the sample mean and s 2 is the variance. 82 If 1 / k is > 0 the population is considered to be aggregated; 1 / k = 0 ( s 2 = m ) the population is considered to be randomly (Poisson) distributed and if 1 / k is Wilson LT & Room PM (1983) Clumping patterns of fruit and arthropods in cotton with implications for binomial sampling.

The probability of finding zero individuals P ( 0 ) is estimated with the negative binomial distribution       P   (  0  )    =    (   1  +   m  /  k    )    -  k          P  0    superscript    1    m  k      k      P(0)=(1+m/k)^{-k}     Jones also gives confidence intervals for these probabilities.      CI  =   t    (    P   (  x  )    (   1  -   P   (  x  )     )    N   )    1  /  2         CI    t   superscript      P  x    1    P  x     N     1  2       \mathrm{CI}=t(\frac{P(x)(1-P(x))}{N})^{1/2}     where CI is the confidence interval, t is the critical value taken from the t distribution and N is the total sample size.  Katz family of distributions  Katz proposed a family of distributions (the Katz family ) with 2 parameters ( w 1 , w 2 ). 85 This family of distributions includes the Bernoulli , Geometric , Pascal and Poisson distributions as special cases. The mean and variance of a Katz distribution are      m  =    w  1    1  -   w  2         m     subscript  w  1     1   subscript  w  2       m=\frac{w_{1}}{1-w_{2}}          s  2   =    w  1     (   1  -   w  2    )   2         superscript  s  2      subscript  w  1    superscript    1   subscript  w  2    2      s^{2}=\frac{w_{1}}{(1-w_{2})^{2}}     where m is the mean and s 2 is the variance of the sample. The parameters can be estimated by the method of moments from which we have        w  1    (   1  -   w  2    )    =  m         subscript  w  1     1   subscript  w  2     m    \frac{w_{1}}{(1-w_{2})}=m           w  2    (   1  -   w  2    )    =     s  2   -  m   m          subscript  w  2     1   subscript  w  2          superscript  s  2   m   m     \frac{w_{2}}{(1-w_{2})}=\frac{s^{2}-m}{m}     For a Poisson distribution w 2 = 0 and w 1 = λ the parameter of the Possion distribution. This family of distributions is also sometimes known as the Panjer family of distributions.  The Katz family is related to the Sundt-Jewel family of distributions: 86      p  n   =    (   a  +   b  n    )    p   n  -  1          subscript  p  n       a    b  n     subscript  p    n  1       p_{n}=(a+\frac{b}{n})p_{n-1}     The only members of the Sundt-Jewel family are the Poisson, binomial, negative binomial (Pascal), extended truncated negative binomial and logarithmic series distributions .  If the population obeys a Katz distribution then the coefficients of Taylor's law are      a  =   -   log   (   1  -   w  2    )         a        1   subscript  w  2        a=-\log(1-w_{2})         b  =  1      b  1    b=1     Katz also introduced a statistical test 87       J  n   =     n  2       s  2   -  m   m         subscript  J  n         n  2         superscript  s  2   m   m      J_{n}=\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}\frac{s^{2}-m}{m}     where J n is the test statistic, s 2 is the variance of the sample, m is the mean of the sample and n is the sample size. J n is asymptotically normally distributed with a zero mean and unit variance. If the sample is Poisson distributed J n = 0; values of J n 0 indicate under and over dispersion respectively. Overdispersion is often caused by latent heterogeneity - the presence of multiple sub populations within the population the sample is drawn from.  This statistic is related to the Neyman-Scott statistic       N  S   =      n  -  1   2     (     s  2   m   -  1   )          N  S           n  1   2         superscript  s  2   m   1      NS=\sqrt{\frac{n-1}{2}}(\frac{s^{2}}{m}-1)     which is known to be asymptotically normal and the conditional chi-squared statistic (Poisson dispersion test)      T  =     (   n  -  1   )    s  2    m       T        n  1    superscript  s  2    m     T=\frac{(n-1)s^{2}}{m}     which is known to have an asymptotic chi squared distribution with n − 1 degrees of freedom when the population is Poisson distributed.  If the population obeys Taylor's law then       J  n   =     n  2     (    a   m   b  -  1     -  1   )         subscript  J  n         n  2        a   superscript  m    b  1     1      J_{n}=\sqrt{\frac{n}{2}}(am^{b-1}-1)     Time to extinction  If Taylor's law is assumed to apply it is possible to determine the mean time to local extinction. This model assumes a simple random walk in time and the absence of density dependent population regulation. 88  Let     N   t  +  1    =   r   N  t         subscript  N    t  1      r   subscript  N  t      N_{t+1}=rN_{t}   where N t+1 and N t are the population sizes at time t + 1 and t respectively and r is parameter equal to the annual increase (decrease in population). Then       v  a  r   (  r  )    =    s  2    (   log   (  r  )    )          v  a  r  r      superscript  s  2     r      var(r)=s^{2}(\log(r))     where var ( r ) is the variance of r .  Let K be a measure of the species abundance (organisms per unit area). Then       T  E   =     2   log   (  N  )      V  a  r   (  r  )      (    log   (  K  )    -    log   (  N  )    2    )         subscript  T  E         2    N      V  a  r  r        K       N   2       T_{E}=\frac{2\log(N)}{Var(r)}(\log(K)-\frac{\log(N)}{2})     where T E is the mean time to local extinction.  The probability of extinction by time t is       P   (  t  )    =   1  -   e   t   T  E            P  t     1   superscript  e    t   subscript  T  E        P(t)=1-e^{\frac{t}{T_{E}}}     Minimum population size required to avoid extinction  If a population is lognormally distributed then the harmonic mean of the population size ( H ) is related to the arithmetic mean ( m ) 89      H  =   m  -   a   m   (   b  -  1   )          H    m    a   superscript  m    b  1        H=m-am^{(b-1)}     Given that H must be > 0 for the population to persist then rearranging we have      m  >   a   1   2  -  b         m   superscript  a    1    2  b       m>a^{\frac{1}{2-b}}     is the minimum size of population for the species to persist.  The assumption of a lognormal distribution appears to apply to about half of a sample of 544 species. 90 suggesting that it is at least a plausible assumption.  Sampling size estimators  The degree of precision ( D ) is defined to be s / m where s is the standard deviation and m is the mean. The degree of precision is known as the coefficient of variation in other contexts. In ecology research it is recommended that D be in the range 10-25%. 91 The desired degree of precision is important in estimating the required sample size where an investigator wishes to test if Taylor's law applies to the data. The required sample size has been estimated for a number of simple distributions but where the population distribution is not known or cannot be assumed more complex formulae may needed to determine the required sample size.  Where the population is Poisson distributed the sample size ( n ) needed is      n  =     (   t  /  D   )   2   /  m       n     superscript    t  D   2   m     n=(t/D)^{2}/m     where t is critical level of the t distribution for the type 1 error with the degrees of freedom that the mean ( m ) was calculated with.  If the population is distributed as a negative binomial distribution then the required sample size is      n  =      (   t  /  D   )   2    (   m  +  k   )    /   (   m  k   )        n       superscript    t  D   2     m  k      m  k      n=(t/D)^{2}(m+k)/(mk)     where k is the parameter of the negative binomial distribution.  A more general sample size estimator has also been proposed 92      n  =     (   t  /  D   )   2   a   m   (   b  -  2   )         n     superscript    t  D   2   a   superscript  m    b  2       n=(t/D)^{2}am^{(b-2)}     where a and b are derived from Taylor's law.  An alternative has been proposed by Southwood 93      n  =    a   m  b    /    D  2         n      a   superscript  m  b     superscript  D  2      n=am^{b}/D^{2}\,     where n is the required sample size, a and b are the Taylor's law coefficients and D is the desired degree of precision.  Karandinos proposed two similar estimators for n . 94 The first was modified by Ruesink to incorporate Taylor's law. 95      n  =     (   t  /   d  m    )   2   a   m   (   b  -  2   )         n     superscript    t   subscript  d  m    2   a   superscript  m    b  2       n=(t/d_{m})^{2}am^{(b-2)}     where d is the ratio of half the desired confidence interval ( CI ) to the mean. In symbols       d  m   =    C  I    2  m         subscript  d  m       C  I     2  m      d_{m}=\frac{CI}{2m}     The second estimator is used in binomial (presence-absence) sampling. The desired sample size ( n ) is      n  =     (   t  /   d  p    )   2    p   -  1    q       n     superscript    t   subscript  d  p    2    superscript  p    1    q     n=(t/d_{p})^{2}p^{-1}q     where the d p is ratio of half the desired confidence interval to the proportion of sample units with individuals, p is proportion of samples containing individuals and q = 1 - p . In symbols       d  p   =    C  I    2  p         subscript  d  p       C  I     2  p      d_{p}=\frac{CI}{2p}     For binary (presence/absence) sampling, Schulthess et al modified Karandinos' equation      N  =     (   t   D   p  i     )   2     1  -  p   p        N     superscript    t   subscript  D    p  i     2       1  p   p      N=(\frac{t}{D_{pi}})^{2}\frac{1-p}{p}     where N is the required sample size, p is the proportion of units containing the organisms of interest, t is the chosen level of significance and D ip is a parameter derived from Taylor's law. 96  Sequential sampling  Sequential analysis is a method of statistical analysis where the sample size is not fixed in advance. Instead samples are taken in accordance with a predefined stopping rule . Taylor's law has been used to derive a number of stopping rules.  A formula for fixed precision in serial sampling to test Taylor's law was derived by Green in 1970. 97       log  T   =      log   (   D  2   )    -  a    b  -  2    +    (   log  n   )     b  -  1    b  -  2            T            superscript  D  2    a     b  2        n       b  1     b  2        \log T=\frac{\log(D^{2})-a}{b-2}+(\log n)\frac{b-1}{b-2}     where T is the cumulative sample total, D is the level of precision, n is the sample size and a and b are obtained from Taylor's law.  As an aid to pest control Wilson et al developed a test that incorporated a threshold level where action should be taken. 98 The required sample size is      n  =   t    |   m  -  T   |    -  2    a   m  b        n    t   superscript      m  T      2    a   superscript  m  b      n=t|m-T|^{-2}am^{b}     where a and b are the Taylor coefficients, || is the absolute value , m is the sample mean, T is the threshold level and t is the critical level of the t distribution. The authors also provided a similar test for binomial (presence-absence) sampling      n  =   t    |   m  -  T   |    -  2    p  q       n    t   superscript      m  T      2    p  q     n=t|m-T|^{-2}pq     where p is the probability of finding a sample with pests present and q = 1 - p .  Green derived another sampling formula for sequential sampling based on Taylor's law 99      D  =    (   a   n   1  -  b     T   b  -  2     )    1  /  2        D   superscript    a   superscript  n    1  b     superscript  T    b  2       1  2      D=(an^{1-b}T^{b-2})^{1/2}     where D is the degree of precision, a and b are the Taylor's law coefficients, n is the sample size and T is the total number of individuals sampled.  Serra et al have proposed a stopping rule based on Taylor's law. 100      T  n   ≥    (    a   n   1  -  b      D  2    )    1   2  -  b          subscript  T  n    superscript      a   superscript  n    1  b      superscript  D  2      1    2  b       T_{n}\geq(\frac{an^{1-b}}{D^{2}})^{\frac{1}{2-b}}     where a and b are the parameters from Taylor's law, D is the desired level of precision and T n is the total sample size.  Serra et al also proposed a second stopping rule based on Iwoa's regression       T  n   ≥    α  -  1     D  2   -    β  -  1   n          subscript  T  n       α  1      superscript  D  2       β  1   n       T_{n}\geq\frac{\alpha-1}{D^{2}-\frac{\beta-1}{n}}     where α and β are the parameters of the regression line, D is the desired level of precision and T n is the total sample size.  The authors recommended that D be set at 0.1 for studies of population dynamics and D = 0.25 for pest control.  Related analyses  It is considered to be good practice to estimate at least one additional analysis of aggregation (other than Taylor's law) because the use of only a single index may be misleading. 101 Although a number of other methods for detecting relationships between the variance and mean in biological samples have been proposed, to date none have achieved the popularity of Taylor's law. The most popular analysis used in conjunction with Taylor's law is probably Iowa's Patchiness regression test but all the methods listed here have been used in the literature.  Barlett-Iawo model  Barlett in 1936 102 and later Iawo independently in 1968 103 both proposed an alternative relationship between the variance and the mean. In symbols       s  i  2   =    a   m  i    +   b    m  i  2           superscript   subscript  s  i   2       a   subscript  m  i      b   superscript   subscript  m  i   2       s_{i}^{2}=am_{i}+bm_{i}^{2}\,     where s is the variance in the i th sample and m i is the mean of the i th sample  When the population follows a negative binomial distribution , a = 1 and b = k (the exponent of the negative binomial distribution).  This alternative formulation has not been found to be as good a fit as Taylor's law in most studies.  Nachman model  Nachman proposed a relationship between the mean density and the proportion of samples with zero counts: 104       p  0   =   exp   (   -   a   m  b     )         subscript  p  0         a   superscript  m  b        p_{0}=\exp(-am^{b})     where p 0 is the proportion of the sample with zero counts, m is the mean density, a is a scale parameter and b is a dispersion parameter. If a = b = 0 the distribution is random. This relationship is usually tested in its logarithmic form       log  m   =   c  +   d   log   p  0            m     c    d     subscript  p  0        \log m=c+d\log p_{0}     Allsop used this relationship along with Taylor's law to derive an expression for the proportion of infested units in a sample 105      P  1   =   1  -   e  x  p   (   -   e  x  p   (       l  o   g  e    (    A  2   a   )     b  -  2    +   l  o   g  e    (  n  )    (     b  -  1    b  -  2    -  1   )     -  c   d   )     )          subscript  P  1     1    e  x  p      e  x  p            l  o   subscript  g  e      superscript  A  2   a      b  2      l  o   subscript  g  e   n        b  1     b  2    1     c   d         P_{1}=1-exp(-exp(\frac{\frac{log_{e}(\frac{A^{2}}{a})}{b-2}+log_{e}(n)(\frac{b%
 -1}{b-2}-1)-c}{d}))       N  =   n   P  1        N    n   subscript  P  1      N=nP_{1}     where       A  2   =    D  2    z   α  2   2         superscript  A  2      superscript  D  2    subscript   superscript  z  2     α  2       A^{2}=\frac{D^{2}}{z^{2}_{\frac{\alpha}{2}}}     where D 2 is the degree of precision desired, z α/2 is the upper α/2 of the normal distribution, a and b are the Taylor's law coefficients, c and d are the Nachman coefficients, n is the sample size and N is the number of infested units.  Kono-Sugino equation  Binary sampling is not uncommonly used in ecology. In 1958 Kono and Sugino derived an equation that relates the proportion of samples without individuals to the mean density of the samples. 106       log   (  m  )    =    log   (  a  )    +   b   log   (   -   log   (   p  0   )     )            m       a     b         subscript  p  0          \log(m)=\log(a)+b\log(-\log(p_{0}))     where p 0 is the proportion of the sample with no individuals, m is the mean sample density, a and b are constants. Like Taylor's law this equation has been found to fit a variety of populations including ones that obey Taylor's law. Unlike the negative binomial distribution this model is independent of the mean density.  The derivation of this equation is straightforward. Let the proportion of empty units be p 0 and assume that these are distributed exponentially. Then       p  0   =   e  x  p   (   -   A   m  B     )         subscript  p  0     e  x  p      A   superscript  m  B        p_{0}=exp(-Am^{B})     Taking logs twice and re arranging, we obtain the equation above. This model is the same as that proposed by Nachman.  The advantage of this model is that it does not require counting the individuals but rather their presence or absence. Counting individuals may not be possible in many cases particularly where insects are the matter of study.   Note   The equation was derived while examining the relationship between the proportion ( P ) of a series of rice hills infested and the mean severity of infestation ( m ). The model studied was      P  =   1  -   a   e   b  m          P    1    a   superscript  e    b  m        P=1-ae^{bm}     where a and b are empirical constants. Based on this model the constants a and b were derived and a table prepared relating the values of P and m   Uses   The predicted estimates of m from this equation are subject to bias 107 and it is recommended that the adjusted mean ( m a ) be used instead 108       m  a   =   m   (   1  -    v  a  r   (   log   (   m  i   )    )    2    )         subscript  m  a     m    1      v  a  r     subscript  m  i     2       m_{a}=m(1-\frac{var(\log(m_{i}))}{2})     where var () is the variance of the sample unit means ( m i ) and m is the overall mean.  An alternative adjustment to the mean estimates is 109       m  a   =   m   e   (    M  S  E   /  2   )          subscript  m  a     m   superscript  e      M  S  E   2       m_{a}=me^{(MSE/2)}     where MSE is the mean square error of the regression.  This model may also be used to estimate stop lines for enumerative (sequential) sampling. The variance of the estimated means is 110       V  a  r   (  m  )    =    m  2    (      c  1   +   c  2    -   c  3    +   M  S  E    )          V  a  r  m      superscript  m  2          subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2     subscript  c  3      M  S  E       Var(m)=m^{2}(c_{1}+c_{2}-c_{3}+MSE)     where       c  1   =     β  2    (   1  -   p  0    )     n   p  0    log  e     (   p  0   )   2          subscript  c  1        superscript  β  2     1   subscript  p  0      fragments  n   subscript  p  0    subscript   e    superscript   fragments  normal-(   subscript  p  0   normal-)   2       c_{1}=\frac{\beta^{2}(1-p_{0})}{np_{0}\log_{e}(p_{0})^{2}}          c  2   =     M  S  E   N   +    s  β  2    (     log  e    (    log  e    (   p  0   )    )    -   p  2    )          subscript  c  2         M  S  E   N      superscript   subscript  s  β   2       subscript   e     subscript   e    subscript  p  0      superscript  p  2        c_{2}=\frac{MSE}{N}+s_{\beta}^{2}(\log_{e}(\log_{e}(p_{0}))-p^{2})          c  3   =    exp   (   a  +    (   b  -  2   )    [   α  -   β    log  e    (   p  0   )      ]     )    n        subscript  c  3         a      b  2    delimited-[]    α    β    subscript   e    subscript  p  0          n     c_{3}=\frac{\exp(a+(b-2)[\alpha-\beta\log_{e}(p_{0})])}{n}     where MSE is the mean square error of the regression, α and β are the constant and slope of the regression respectively, s β 2 is the variance of the slope of the regression, N is the number of points in the regression, n is the number of sample units and p is the mean value of p 0 in the regression. The parameters a and b are estimated from Taylor's law:       s  2   =   a  +   b    log  e    (  m  )           superscript  s  2     a    b    subscript   e   m       s^{2}=a+b\log_{e}(m)     Hughes-Madden equation  Hughes and Madden have proposed testing a similar relationship also applicable to binary sampling (presence/absence in a sampled unit) 111 112       s  2   =   a   p  b     (   1  -  p   )   c         superscript  s  2     a   superscript  p  b    superscript    1  p   c      s^{2}=ap^{b}(1-p)^{c}     where a , b and c are constants, s 2 is the variance and p is the proportion of units with at least one individual. In logarithmic form this relationship is        log   (   s  2   )    =    log   (  a  )    +   b   log   (  p  )     +   c   log   (   1  -  p   )       .         superscript  s  2        a     b    p      c      1  p        \log(s^{2})=\log(a)+b\log(p)+c\log(1-p).     This relationship has not yet been subjected to the extensive testing that Taylor's law has been subjected to. For this reason its general applicability presently remains uncertain.  A variant of this equation was proposed by Shiyomi et al 113 who suggested testing the regression       log   (    s  2   /   n  2    )    =   a  +   b   log   (    p   (   1  -  p   )    /  n   )               superscript  s  2    superscript  n  2       a    b        p    1  p    n        \log(s^{2}/n^{2})=a+b\log(p(1-p)/n)     where s 2 is the variance, a and b are the constants of the regression, n is the sample size and p is the probability of a sample containing at least one individual.  Negative binomial distribution model  A negative binomial model has also been proposed. 114 The dispersion parameter ( k ) using the method of moments is m 2 / ( s 2 - m ) and p i is the proportion of samples with counts > 0. The s 2 used in the calculation of k are the values predicted by Taylor's law. p i is plotted against 1 - ( k ( k + m ) −1 ) k and the fit of the data is visually inspected.  Perry and Taylor have proposed an alternative estimator of k based on Taylor's law. 115       1  /  k   =    a   m   b  -  2     -   1  /  m          1  k       a   superscript  m    b  2       1  m      1/k=am^{b-2}-1/m     A better estimate of the dispersion parameter can be made with the method of maximum likelihood . For the negative binomial it can be estimated from the equation 116       ∑    A  x    k  +  x     =   N   log   (   1  +   m  /  k    )              subscript  A  x     k  x       N      1    m  k        \sum\frac{A_{x}}{k+x}=N\log(1+m/k)     where A x is the total number of samples with more than x individuals, N is the total number of individuals, x is the number of individuals in a sample, m is the mean number of individuals per sample and k is the exponent. The value of k has to estimated numerically.  Goodness of fit of this model can be tested in a number of ways including using the chi square test. As these may be biased by small samples an alternative is the U statistic - the difference between the variance expected under the negative binomial distribution and that of the sample. The expected variance of this distribution is m + m 2 / k and      U  =     s  2   -  m   +    m  2   /  k        U       superscript  s  2   m      superscript  m  2   k      U=s^{2}-m+m^{2}/k     where s 2 is the sample variance, m is the sample mean and k is the negative binomial parameter.  The variance of U is 117       V  a  r   (  U  )    =    2  m   p  2   q   (    1  -   R  2      -   log   (   1  -  R   )     -  R    )    +    p  4       (   1  -  R   )    -  k    -  1  -   k  R     N    (    -   log   (   1  -  R   )     -  R   )   2             V  a  r  U       2  m   superscript  p  2   q      1   superscript  R  2            1  R     R        superscript  p  4        superscript    1  R     k    1    k  R      N   superscript          1  R     R   2         Var(U)=2mp^{2}q(\frac{1-R^{2}}{-\log(1-R)-R})+p^{4}\frac{(1-R)^{-k}-1-kR}{N(-%
 \log(1-R)-R)^{2}}     where p = m / k , q = 1 + p , R = p / q and N is the total number of individuals in the sample. The expected value of U is 0. For large sample sizes U is distributed normally.  Note: The negative binomial is actually a family of distributions defined by the relation of the mean to the variance       σ  2   =   μ  +   a   μ  p          superscript  σ  2     μ    a   superscript  μ  p       \sigma^{2}=\mu+a\mu^{p}     where a and p are constants. When a = 0 this defines the Poisson distribution. With p = 1 and p = 2, the distribution is known as the NB1 and NB2 distribution respectively.  This model is a version of that proposed earlier by Barlett.  Tests for a common dispersion parameter  The dispersion parameter ( k ) 118 is      k  =    m  2   /   (    s  2   -  m   )        k     superscript  m  2      superscript  s  2   m      k=m^{2}/(s^{2}-m)     where m is the sample mean and s 2 is the variance. If k −1 is > 0 the population is considered to be aggregated; k −1 = 0 the population is considered to be random; and if k −1 is Southwood, TRE (1978) Ecological methods. Chapman & Hall, London, England       k  i   =   a  +   b   m  i          subscript  k  i     a    b   subscript  m  i       k_{i}=a+bm_{i}     where k i and m i are the dispersion parameter and the mean of the ith sample respectively to test for the existence of a common dispersion parameter ( k c ). A slope ( b ) value significantly > 0 indicates the dependence of k on the mean density.  An alternative method was proposed by Elliot who suggested plotting ( s 2 - m ) against ( m 2 - s 2 / n ). 119  k c is equal to 1/slope of this regression.  Charlier coefficient  This coefficient ( C ) is defined as      C  =    100    (    s  2   -  m   )   0.5    m       C      100   superscript     superscript  s  2   m   0.5    m     C=\frac{100(s^{2}-m)^{0.5}}{m}     If the population can be assumed to be distributed in a negative binomial fashion, then C = 100 (1/ k ) 0.5 where k is the dispersion parameter of the distribution.  Cole's index of dispersion  This index ( I c ) is defined as 120      I  c   =    Σ   x  2      (   Σ  x   )   2         subscript  I  c       normal-Σ   superscript  x  2     superscript    normal-Σ  x   2      I_{c}=\frac{\Sigma x^{2}}{(\Sigma x)^{2}}     The usual interpretation of this index is as follows: values of I c 1 are taken to mean a uniform distribution, a random distribution or an aggregated distribution.  Because s 2 = Σ x 2 - (Σx) 2 , the index can also be written       I  c   =     s  2   +    (   n  m   )   2      (   n  m   )   2    =     1   n  2      s  2    m  2     +  1          subscript  I  c        superscript  s  2    superscript    n  m   2     superscript    n  m   2               1   superscript  n  2       superscript  s  2    superscript  m  2     1      I_{c}=\frac{s^{2}+(nm)^{2}}{(nm)^{2}}=\frac{1}{n^{2}}\frac{s^{2}}{m^{2}}+1     If Taylor's law can be assumed to hold, then       I  c   =     a   m   b  -  2      n  2    +  1        subscript  I  c         a   superscript  m    b  2      superscript  n  2    1     I_{c}=\frac{am^{b-2}}{n^{2}}+1     Lloyd's indexes  Lloyd's index of mean crowding ( IMC ) is the average number of other points contained in the sample unit that contains a randomly chosen point. 121      IMC  =    m  +    s  2   /  m    -  1       IMC      m     superscript  s  2   m    1     \mathrm{IMC}=m+s^{2}/m-1     where m is the sample mean and s 2 is the variance.  Lloyd's index of patchiness ( IP ) 122 is      IP  =    I  M  C   /  m       IP      I  M  C   m     \mathrm{IP}=IMC/m     It is a measure of pattern intensity that is unaffected by thinning (random removal of points). This index was also proposed by Pielou in 1988 and is sometimes known by this name also.  Because an estimate of the variance of IP is extremely difficult to estimate from the formula itself, LLyod suggested fitting a negative binomial distribution to the data. This method gives a parameter k       s  2   =   m  +    m  2   k         superscript  s  2     m     superscript  m  2   k      s^{2}=m+\frac{m^{2}}{k}     Then       S  E   (   I  P   )    =    1   k  2     [    v  a  r   (  k  )    +    k   (   k  +  1   )    (   k  +  m   )     m  q     ]          S  E    I  P        1   superscript  k  2     delimited-[]      v  a  r  k       k    k  1     k  m      m  q         SE(IP)=\frac{1}{k^{2}}[var(k)+\frac{k(k+1)(k+m)}{mq}]     where SE ( IP ) is the standard error of the index of patchiness, var ( k ) is the variance of the parameter k and q is the number of quadrats sampled..  If the population obeys Taylor's law then      IMC  =    m  +    a   -  1     m   1  -  b      -  1       IMC      m     superscript  a    1     superscript  m    1  b      1     \mathrm{IMC}=m+a^{-1}m^{1-b}-1         IP  =    1  +    a   -  1     m   -  b      -   1  m        IP      1     superscript  a    1     superscript  m    b        1  m      \mathrm{IP}=1+a^{-1}m^{-b}-\frac{1}{m}     Patchiness regression test  Iwao proposed a patchiness regression to test for clumping 123 124  Let       y  i   =     m  i   +    s  2   /   m  i     -  1        subscript  y  i        subscript  m  i      superscript  s  2    subscript  m  i     1     y_{i}=m_{i}+s^{2}/m_{i}-1     y i here is Lloyd's index of mean crowding. 125 Perform an ordinary least squares regression of m i against y .  In this regression the value of the slope ( b ) is an indicator of clumping: the slope = 1 if the data is Poisson-distributed. The constant ( a ) is the number of individuals that share a unit of habitat at infinitesimal density and may be  0. These values represent regularity, randomness and aggregation of populations in spatial patterns respectively. A value of a 2 / m is not constant it has been recommended to use instead to regress Lloyd's index against am + bm 2 where a and b are constants. 126  The sample size ( n ) for a given degree of precision ( D ) for this regression is given by 127      n  =     (   t  D   )   2    (      a  +  1   m   +  b   -  1   )        n     superscript    t  D   2           a  1   m   b   1      n=(\frac{t}{D})^{2}(\frac{a+1}{m}+b-1)     where a is the constant in this regression, b is the slope, m is the mean and t is the critical value of the t distribution.  Iawo has proposed a sequential sampling test based on this regression. 128 The upper and lower limits of this test are based on critical densities m c where control of a pest requires action to be taken.       N  u   =    i   m  c    +   t    (    i   (   a  +  1   )    m  c    +    (   b  -  1   )    m  c  2     )    1  /  2           subscript  N  u       i   subscript  m  c      t   superscript      i    a  1    subscript  m  c        b  1    superscript   subscript  m  c   2       1  2        N_{u}=im_{c}+t(i(a+1)m_{c}+(b-1)m_{c}^{2})^{1/2}          N  l   =    i   m  c    -   t    (    i   (   a  +  1   )    m  c    +    (   b  -  1   )    m  c  2     )    1  /  2           subscript  N  l       i   subscript  m  c      t   superscript      i    a  1    subscript  m  c        b  1    superscript   subscript  m  c   2       1  2        N_{l}=im_{c}-t(i(a+1)m_{c}+(b-1)m_{c}^{2})^{1/2}     where N u and N l are the upper and lower bounds respectively, a is the constant from the regression, b is the slope and i is the number of samples.  Kuno has proposed an alternative sequential stopping test also based on this regression. 129       T  n   =    a  +  1     D  2   -    b  -  1   n          subscript  T  n       a  1      superscript  D  2       b  1   n       T_{n}=\frac{a+1}{D^{2}-\frac{b-1}{n}}     where T n is the total sample size, D is the degree of precision, n is the number of samples units, a is the constant and b is the slope from the regression respectively.  Kuno's test is subject to the condition that n ≥ ( b - 1) / D 2  Parrella and Jones have proposed an alternative but related stop line 130      T  n   =    (   1  -   n  N    )     a  +  1     D  2   -    (   1  -   n  N    )     b  -  1   n            subscript  T  n       1    n  N        a  1      superscript  D  2       1    n  N        b  1   n         T_{n}=(1-\frac{n}{N})\frac{a+1}{D^{2}-(1-\frac{n}{N})\frac{b-1}{n}}     where a and b are the parameters from the regression, N is the maximum number of sampled units and n is the individual sample size.  Morisita’s index of dispersion  Morisita’s index of dispersion ( I m ) is the scaled probability that two points chosen at random from the whole population are in the same sample. 131 Higher values indicate a more clumped distribution.       I  m   =    ∑   x   (   x  -  1   )      n  m   (   m  -  1   )          subscript  I  m         x    x  1       n  m    m  1       I_{m}=\frac{\sum x(x-1)}{nm(m-1)}     An alternative formulation is       I  m   =   n     ∑   x  2    -   ∑  x       (   ∑  x   )   2   -   ∑  x           subscript  I  m     n         superscript  x  2      x       superscript    x   2     x        I_{m}=n\frac{\sum x^{2}-\sum x}{(\sum x)^{2}-\sum x}     where n is the total sample size, m is the sample mean and x are the individual values with the sum taken over the whole sample. It is also equal to       I  m   =    n  I  M  C    (    n  m   -  1   )         subscript  I  m       n  I  M  C       n  m   1      I_{m}=\frac{nIMC}{(nm-1)}     where IMC is Lloyd's index of crowding. 132  This index is relatively independent of the population density but is affected by the sample size.

R function  Standardised Morisita’s index  Smith-Gill developed a statistic based on Morisita’s index which is independent of both sample size and population density and bounded by -1 and +1. This statistic is calculated as follows 134  First determine Morisita's index ( I d ) in the usual fashion. Then let k be the number of units the population was sampled from.

The standardised index ( I p ) is then calculated from one of the formulae below  When I d ≥ M c > 1       I  p   =   0.5  +   0.5   (     I  d   -   M  c     k  -   M  c     )          subscript  I  p     0.5    0.5       subscript  I  d    subscript  M  c      k   subscript  M  c         I_{p}=0.5+0.5(\frac{I_{d}-M_{c}}{k-M_{c}})     When M c > I d ≥ 1       I  p   =   0.5   (     I  d   -  1     M  u   -  1    )         subscript  I  p     0.5       subscript  I  d   1      subscript  M  u   1       I_{p}=0.5(\frac{I_{d}-1}{M_{u}-1})     When 1 > I d ≥ M u       I  p   =   -   0.5   (     I  d   -  1     M  u   -  1    )          subscript  I  p       0.5       subscript  I  d   1      subscript  M  u   1        I_{p}=-0.5(\frac{I_{d}-1}{M_{u}-1})     When 1 > M u > I d       I  p   =    -  0.5   +   0.5   (     I  d   -   M  u     M  u    )          subscript  I  p       0.5     0.5       subscript  I  d    subscript  M  u     subscript  M  u        I_{p}=-0.5+0.5(\frac{I_{d}-M_{u}}{M_{u}})     I p ranges between +1 and -1 with 95% confidence intervals of ±0.5. I p has the value of 0 if the pattern is random; if the pattern is uniform, I p  p > 0.  Southwood's index of spatial aggregation  Southwood's index of spatial aggregation ( k ) is defined as       1  k   =     m  *   m   -  1         1  k        superscript  m    m   1     \frac{1}{k}=\frac{m^{*}}{m}-1     where m is the mean of the sample and m * is Lloyd's index of crowding. 135  Fisher's index of dispersion  Fisher's index of dispersion 136 137 is      ID  =     (   n  -  1   )    s  2    m       ID        n  1    superscript  s  2    m     \mathrm{ID}=\frac{(n-1)s^{2}}{m}     This index may be used to test for over dispersion of the population. It is recommended that in applications n > 5 138 and that the sample total divided by the number of samples is > 3. In symbols        ∑  x   n   >  3          x   n   3    \frac{\sum x}{n}>3     where x is an individual sample value. The expectation of the index is equal to n and it is distributed as the chi-square distribution with n − 1 degrees of freedom when the population is Poisson distributed. 139 It is equal to the scale parameter when the population obeys the gamma distribution .  It can be applied both to the overall population and to the individual areas sampled individually. The use of this test on the individual sample areas should also include the use of a Bonferroni correction factor.  If the population obeys Taylor's law then      ID  =    (   n  -  1   )   a   m   b  -  1         ID      n  1   a   superscript  m    b  1       \mathrm{ID}=(n-1)am^{b-1}     Index of cluster size  The index of cluster size ( ICS ) was created by David and Moore. 140 Under a random (Poisson) distribution ICS is expected to equal 0. Positive values indicate a clumped distribution; negative values indicate a uniform distribution.      ICS  =     s  2   /  m   -  1       ICS       superscript  s  2   m   1     \mathrm{ICS}=s^{2}/m-1     where s 2 is the variance and m is the mean.  If the population obeys Taylor's law      ICS  =    a   m   b  -  1     -  1       ICS      a   superscript  m    b  1     1     \mathrm{ICS}=am^{b-1}-1     The ICS is also equal to Katz's test statistic divided by ( n / 2 ) 1/2 where n is the sample size. It is also related to Clapham's test statistic. It is also sometimes referred to as the clumping index.  Green’s index  Green’s index ( GI ) is a modification of the index of cluster size that is independent of n the number of sample units. 141       C  x   =      s  2   /  m   -  1     n  m   -  1         subscript  C  x          superscript  s  2   m   1       n  m   1      C_{x}=\frac{s^{2}/m-1}{nm-1}     This index equals 0 if the distribution is random, 1 if it is maximally aggregated and -1 / ( nm - 1 ) if it is uniform.  The distribution of Green's index is not currently known so statistical tests have been difficult to devise for it.  If the population obeys Taylor's law       C  x   =     a   m   b  -  1     -  1    (    n  m   -  1   )         subscript  C  x         a   superscript  m    b  1     1       n  m   1      C_{x}=\frac{am^{b-1}-1}{(nm-1)}     Binary dispersal index  Binary sampling (presence/absence) is frequently used where it is difficult to obtain accurate counts. The dispersal index ( D ) is used when the study population is divided into a series of equal samples ( number of units = N : number of units per sample = n : total population size = n x N ). 142 The theoretical variance of a sample from a population with a binomial distribution is       s  2   =   n  p   (   1  -  p   )         superscript  s  2     n  p    1  p      s^{2}=np(1-p)     where s 2 is the variance, n is the number of units sampled and p is the mean proportion of sampling units with at least one individual present. The dispersal index ( D ) is defined as the ratio of observed variance to the expected variance. In symbols      D  =    v  a   r   o  b  s      v  a   r   b  i  n      =    s  2    n  p   (   1  -  p   )           D      v  a   subscript  r    o  b  s       v  a   subscript  r    b  i  n              superscript  s  2     n  p    1  p        D=\frac{var_{obs}}{var_{bin}}=\frac{s^{2}}{np(1-p)}     where var obs is the observed variance and var bin is the expected variance. The expected variance is calculated with the overall mean of the population. Values of D > 1 are considered to suggest aggregation. D ( n - 1 ) is distributed as the chi squared variable with n - 1 degrees of freedom where n is the number of units sampled.  An alternative test is the C test. 143      C  =     D   (    n  N   -  1   )    -   n  N      (   2  N   (    n  2   -  n   )    )    1  /  2         C        D      n  N   1      n  N     superscript    2  N     superscript  n  2   n      1  2       C=\frac{D(nN-1)-nN}{(2N(n^{2}-n))^{1/2}}     where D is the dispersal index, n is the number of units per sample and N is the number of samples. C is distributed normally. A statistically significant value of C indicates overdispersion of the population.  D is also related to intraclass correlation ( ρ ) which is defined as 144      ρ  =   1  -    ∑    x  i    (   T  -   x  i    )      p   (   1  -  p   )   N  T   (   T  -  1   )          ρ    1         subscript  x  i     T   subscript  x  i        p    1  p   N  T    T  1        \rho=1-\frac{\sum x_{i}(T-x_{i})}{p(1-p)NT(T-1)}     where T is the number of organisms per sample, p is the likelihood of the organism having the sought after property (diseased, pest free, etc ), and x i is the number of organism in the i th unit with this property. T must be the same for all sampled units. In this case with n constant      ρ  =    D  -  1    n  -  1        ρ      D  1     n  1      \rho=\frac{D-1}{n-1}     If the data can be fitted with a beta-binomial distribution then 145      D  =   1  +     (   n  -  1   )   θ    1  +  θ         D    1        n  1   θ     1  θ       D=1+\frac{(n-1)\theta}{1+\theta}     where θ is the parameter of the distribution. 146  Ma's population aggregation critical density  Ma has proposed a parameter ( m 0 ) - the population aggregation critical density - to relate population density to Taylor's law. 147      m  0   =   e  x  p   (    l  o  g   (  a  )     1  -  b    )         subscript  m  0     e  x  p      l  o  g  a     1  b       m_{0}=exp(\frac{log(a)}{1-b})     Related statistics  A number of statistical tests are known that may be of use in applications.  de Oliveria's statistic  A related statistic suggested by de Oliveria 148 is the difference of the variance and the mean. 149 If the population is Poisson distributed then       v  a  r   (    s  2   -  m   )    =    2   t  2     n  -  1          v  a  r     superscript  s  2   m        2   superscript  t  2      n  1      var(s^{2}-m)=\frac{2t^{2}}{n-1}     where t is the Poisson parameter, s 2 is the variance, m is the mean and n is the sample size. The expected value of s 2 - m is zero. This statistic is distributed normally. 150  If the Poisson parameter in this equation is estimated by putting t = m , after a little manipulation this statistic can be written       O  T   =      n  -  1   2       s  2   -  m   m         subscript  O  T           n  1   2         superscript  s  2   m   m      O_{T}=\sqrt{\frac{n-1}{2}}\frac{s^{2}-m}{m}     This is almost identical to Katz's statistic with ( n - 1 ) replacing n . Again O T is normally distributed with mean 0 and unit variance for large n .   Note   de Oliveria actually suggested that the variance of s 2 - m was ( 1 - 2 t 1/2 + 3 t ) / n where t is the Poisson parameter. He suggested that t could be estimated by putting it equal to the mean ( m ) of the sample. Further investigation by Bohning 151 showed that this estimate of the variance was incorrect. Bohning's correction is given in the equations above.  Clapham's test  In 1936 Clapham proposed using the ratio of the variance to the mean as a test statistic (the relative variance). 152 In symbols      θ  =    s  2   m       θ     superscript  s  2   m     \theta=\frac{s^{2}}{m}     For a Possion distribution this ratio equals 1. To test for deviations from this value he proposed testing its value against the chi square distribution with n degrees of freedom where n is the number of sample units. The distribution of this statistic was studied further by Blackman 153 who noted that it was approximately normally distributed with a mean of 1 and a variance ( V θ ) of       V  θ   =    2  n     (   n  -  1   )   2         subscript  V  θ       2  n    superscript    n  1   2      V_{\theta}=\frac{2n}{(n-1)^{2}}     The derivation of the variance was re analysed by Bartlett 154 who considered it to be       V  θ   =   2   n  -  1         subscript  V  θ     2    n  1      V_{\theta}=\frac{2}{n-1}     For large samples these two formulae are in approximate agreement. This test is related to the later Katz's J n statistic.  If the population obeys Taylor's law then      θ  =   a   m   b  -  1         θ    a   superscript  m    b  1       \theta=am^{b-1}      Note   A refinement on this test has also been published 155 These authors noted that this test tends to detect overdispersion at higher scales even when this was not present in the data. They noted that that the use of the multinomial distribution may be more appropriate than the use of a Poisson distribution for such data. The statistic θ is distributed      θ  =    s  2   m   =    1  n    ∑    (    x  i   -   n  N    )   2           θ     superscript  s  2   m            1  n      superscript     subscript  x  i     n  N    2        \theta=\frac{s^{2}}{m}=\frac{1}{n}\sum{(x_{i}-\frac{n}{N})^{2}}     where N is the number of sample units, n is the total number of samples examined and x i are the individual data values.  The expectation and variance of θ are       E   (  θ  )    =   N   N  -  1          E  θ     N    N  1      E(\theta)=\frac{N}{N-1}          V  a  r   (  θ  )    =      (   N  -  1   )   2    N  3    -     2  N   -  3    n   N  2            V  a  r  θ        superscript    N  1   2    superscript  N  3          2  N   3     n   superscript  N  2        Var(\theta)=\frac{(N-1)^{2}}{N^{3}}-\frac{2N-3}{nN^{2}}     For large N  E (θ) is approximately 1 and       V  a  r   (  θ  )    ∼    2  N    (   1  -   1  n    )       similar-to    V  a  r  θ       2  N     1    1  n       Var(\theta)\sim\ \frac{2}{N}(1-\frac{1}{n})     If the number of individuals sampled ( n ) is large this estimate of the variance is in agreement with those derived earlier. However for smaller samples these latter estimates are more precise and should be used.
