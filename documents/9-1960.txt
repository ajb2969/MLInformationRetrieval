   Sums of powers      Sums of powers   In mathematics and statistics , sums of powers occur in a number of contexts:   Sums of squares arise in many contexts.  Faulhaber's formula expresses     1  k   +   2  k   +   3  k   +  ⋯  +   n  k        superscript  1  k    superscript  2  k    superscript  3  k   normal-⋯   superscript  n  k     1^{k}+2^{k}+3^{k}+\cdots+n^{k}   as a polynomial in n .  Fermat's Last Theorem states that      x  k   +   y  k    =   z  k          superscript  x  k    superscript  y  k     superscript  z  k     x^{k}+y^{k}=z^{k}   is impossible in positive integers with k >2.  The equation of a superellipse is       |   x  /  a   |   k   +    |   y  /  b   |   k    =  1         superscript      x  a    k    superscript      y  b    k    1    |x/a|^{k}+|y/b|^{k}=1   . The squircle is the case     k  =  4   ,   a  =  b      formulae-sequence    k  4     a  b     k=4,a=b   .  Euler's sum of powers conjecture (disproved) concerns situations in which the sum of n integers, each a k th power of an integer, equals another k th power.  The Fermat-Catalan conjecture asks whether there are an infinitude of examples in which the sum of two coprime integers, each a power of an integer, with the powers not necessarily equal, can equal another integer that is a power, with the reciprocals of the three powers summing to less than 1.  Beal's conjecture concerns the question of whether the sum of two coprime integers, each a power greater than 2 of an integer, with the powers not necessarily equal, can equal another integer that is a power greater than 2.  The Jacobi–Madden equation is      a  4   +   b  4   +   c  4   +   d  4    =    (   a  +  b  +  c  +  d   )   4          superscript  a  4    superscript  b  4    superscript  c  4    superscript  d  4     superscript    a  b  c  d   4     a^{4}+b^{4}+c^{4}+d^{4}=(a+b+c+d)^{4}   in integers.  The Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem considers sums of two sets of k th powers of integers that are equal for multiple values of k .  A taxicab number is the smallest integer that can be expressed as a sum of two positive third powers in n distinct ways.  The Riemann zeta function is the sum of the reciprocals of the positive integers each raised to the power s , where s is a complex number whose real part is greater than 1.  The Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture concerns the minimal value of m + n in       ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i  k    =    ∑   j  =  1   m    b  j  k     .        superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  a  i   k      superscript   subscript     j  1    m    superscript   subscript  b  j   k      \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{j}^{k}.     Waring's problem asks whether for every natural number k there exists an associated positive integer s such that every natural number is the sum of at most s k th powers of natural numbers.  The successive powers of the golden ratio  φ obey the Fibonacci recurrence:     \varphi^{n+1}     = \varphi^n + \varphi^{n-1}.   Newton's identities express the sum of the k th powers of all the roots of a polynomial in terms of the coefficients in the polynomial.    The sum of cubes of numbers in arithmetic progression is sometimes another cube.    The Fermat cubic , in which the sum of three cubes equals another cube, has a general solution.    The power sum symmetric polynomial is a building block for symmetric polynomials.    The sum of the reciprocals of all perfect powers including duplicates (but not including 1) equals 1.
