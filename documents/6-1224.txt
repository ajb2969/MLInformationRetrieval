Viviani's curve as intersection of a sphere and a cylinder

In mathematics, particularly geometry, Viviani's curve, also known as Viviani's window, is a figure eight shaped space curve named after the Italian mathematician Vincenzo Viviani, the intersection of a sphere with a cylinder that is tangent to the sphere and passes through the center of the sphere.
The projection of Viviani's curve onto a plane perpendicular to the line through the crossing point and the sphere center is the lemniscate of Gerono.1
Formula
The curve can be obtained by intersecting a sphere of radius 
 
 
 
  centered at the origin,



with the cylinder centered at 
 
 
 
  of radius 
 
 
 
  given by



The resulting curve of intersection, 
 
 
 
 , can be parameterized by 
 
 
 
  to give the parametric equation of Viviani's curve:



This is a clelie with 
 
 
 
 , where
