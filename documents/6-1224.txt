   Viviani's curve      Viviani's curve   (Figure)  Viviani's curve as intersection of a sphere and a cylinder   In mathematics , particularly geometry , Viviani's curve , also known as Viviani's window , is a figure eight shaped space curve named after the Italian mathematician Vincenzo Viviani , the intersection of a sphere with a cylinder that is tangent to the sphere and passes through the center of the sphere.  The projection of Viviani's curve onto a plane perpendicular to the line through the crossing point and the sphere center is the lemniscate of Gerono . 1  Formula  The curve can be obtained by intersecting a sphere of radius    2  a      2  a    2a   centered at the origin,        x  2   +   y  2   +   z  2    =   4    a  2            superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    superscript  z  2      4   superscript  a  2      x^{2}+y^{2}+z^{2}=4a^{2}\,     with the cylinder centered at    (  a  ,  0  ,  0  )     a  0  0    (a,0,0)   of radius   a   a   a   given by          (   x  -  a   )   2   +   y  2    =   a  2    .         superscript    x  a   2    superscript  y  2     superscript  a  2     (x-a)^{2}+y^{2}=a^{2}.\,     The resulting curve of intersection,   V   V   V   , can be parameterized by   t   t   t   to give the parametric equation of Viviani's curve:        V   (  t  )    =   ⟨   a   (   1  +   cos   (  t  )     )    ,   a   sin   (  t  )     ,   2  a   sin   (   t  2   )     ⟩    .        V  t      a    1    t       a    t      2  a      t  2        V(t)=\left\langle a(1+\cos(t)),a\sin(t),2a\sin\left(\frac{t}{2}\right)\right\rangle.     This is a clelie with    m  =  1      m  1    m=1   , where    θ  =    t  -  π   2       θ      t  π   2     \theta=\frac{t-\pi}{2}   .
