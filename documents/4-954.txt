   Klein–Nishina formula      Klein–Nishina formula   (Figure)  Klein–Nishina distribution of scattering-angle cross sections over a range of commonly encountered energies.   The Klein–Nishina formula 1 gives the differential cross section of photons scattered from a single free electron in lowest order of quantum electrodynamics . At low frequencies (e.g., visible light ) this is referred to as Thomson scattering ; at higher frequencies (e.g., x-rays and gamma-rays ) this is referred to as Compton scattering .  For an incident photon of energy    E  γ     subscript  E  γ    E_{\gamma}   , the differential cross section is: 2        d  σ    d  Ω    =     α  2    r  c  2   P    (   E  γ   ,  θ  )   2    [      P   (   E  γ   ,  θ  )    +   P    (   E  γ   ,  θ  )    -  1      -  1   +    cos  2    (  θ  )     ]    /  2           d  σ     d  normal-Ω         superscript  α  2    superscript   subscript  r  c   2   P   superscript    subscript  E  γ   θ   2    delimited-[]          P    subscript  E  γ   θ      P   superscript    subscript  E  γ   θ     1      1     superscript   2   θ      2     \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}=\alpha^{2}r_{c}^{2}P(E_{\gamma},\theta)^{2}[P(E_{%
 \gamma},\theta)+P(E_{\gamma},\theta)^{-1}-1+\cos^{2}(\theta)]/2     where     d  σ    d  Ω         d  σ     d  normal-Ω     \frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega}   is a differential cross section ,    d  Ω      d  normal-Ω    d\Omega   is an infinitesimal solid angle element ,   α   α   \alpha   is the fine structure constant (~1/137.04),   θ   θ   \theta   is the scattering angle;     r  c   =    ℏ  /   m  e    c        subscript  r  c       Planck-constant-over-2-pi   subscript  m  e    c     r_{c}=\hbar/m_{e}c   is the "reduced" Compton wave length of the electron (~0.38616 pm);    m  e     subscript  m  e    m_{e}   is the mass of an electron (~511 keV     /   c  2       absent   superscript  c  2     /c^{2}   ); and    P   (   E  γ   ,  θ  )       P    subscript  E  γ   θ     P(E_{\gamma},\theta)   is the ratio of photon energy after and before the collision:       P   (   E  γ   ,  θ  )    =   1   1  +    (     E  γ   /   m  e     c  2    )    (   1  -   cos  θ    )            P    subscript  E  γ   θ      1    1         subscript  E  γ    subscript  m  e     superscript  c  2      1    θ         P(E_{\gamma},\theta)=\frac{1}{1+(E_{\gamma}/m_{e}c^{2})(1-\cos\theta)}     Note that this result may also be expressed in terms of the classical electron radius      r  e   =   α   r  c         subscript  r  e     α   subscript  r  c      r_{e}=\alpha r_{c}   . While this classical quantity is not particularly relevant in quantum electrodynamics, it is easy to appreciate: in the forward direction (for   θ   θ   \theta   ~ 0), photons scatter off electrons as if these were about     r  e   =   α   r  c         subscript  r  e     α   subscript  r  c      r_{e}=\alpha r_{c}   (~2.8179 fm) in linear dimension, and    r  e  2     superscript   subscript  r  e   2    r_{e}^{2}   (~ 7.9406x10 −30 m 2 or 79.406 mb) in size.  The Klein–Nishina formula was derived in 1928 by Oskar Klein and Yoshio Nishina , and was one of the first results obtained from the study of quantum electrodynamics . Consideration of relativistic and quantum mechanical effects allowed development of an accurate equation for the scattering of radiation from a target electron. Before this derivation, the electron cross section had been classically derived by the British physicist and discoverer of the electron , J.J. Thomson . However, scattering experiments showed significant deviations from the results predicted by the Thomson cross section. Further scattering experiments agreed perfectly with the predictions of the Klein–Nishina formula.  Note that if     E  γ   ≪    m  e    c  2       much-less-than   subscript  E  γ      subscript  m  e    superscript  c  2      E_{\gamma}\ll m_{e}c^{2}   ,     P   (   E  γ   ,  θ  )    →  1     normal-→    P    subscript  E  γ   θ    1    P(E_{\gamma},\theta)\rightarrow 1   and the Klein–Nishina formula reduces to the classical Thomson expression.  The final energy of the scattered photon,    E  γ  ′     superscript   subscript  E  γ   normal-′    E_{\gamma}^{\prime}   , depends only on the scattering angle and the original photon energy, and so it can be computed without the use of the Klein–Nishina formula:        E  γ  ′    (   E  γ   ,  θ  )    =     E  γ   ⋅  P    (   E  γ   ,  θ  )           superscript   subscript  E  γ   normal-′     subscript  E  γ   θ       normal-⋅   subscript  E  γ   P     subscript  E  γ   θ      E_{\gamma}^{\prime}(E_{\gamma},\theta)=E_{\gamma}\cdot P(E_{\gamma},\theta)\,     Notes  External links   R.
