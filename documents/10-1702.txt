S-methyl-5-thioribose-1-phosphate isomerase




S-methyl-5-thioribose-1-phosphate isomerase

In enzymology, a S-methyl-5-thioribose-1-phosphate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate 
 
 
 
  S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribulose 1-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate, and one product, S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribulose 1-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-methyl-5-thio-alpha-D-ribose-1-phosphate aldose-ketose-isomerase. Other names in common use include methylthioribose 1-phosphate isomerase, 1-PMTR isomerase, 5-methylthio-5-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate ketol-isomerase, S-methyl-5-thio-5-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate ketol-isomerase, S-methyl-5-thio-5-deoxy-D-ribose-1-phosphate, aldose-ketose-isomerase, 1-phospho-5'-S-methylthioribose isomerase, and S-methyl-5-thio-D-ribose-1-phosphate aldose-ketose-isomerase. This enzyme participates in methionine metabolism.
