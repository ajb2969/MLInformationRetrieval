Pentachlorophenol monooxygenase

Pentachlorophenol monooxygenase (, pentachlorophenol dechlorinase, pentachlorophenol dehalogenase, pentachlorophenol 4-monooxygenase, PCP hydroxylase, pentachlorophenol hydroxylase, PcpB, PCB 4-monooxygenase, PCB4MO) is an enzyme with system name pentachlorophenol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (hydroxylating, dechlorinating).12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) pentachlorophenol + 2 NADPH + H+ + O
 
 
 2 
 
 
 
  2,3,5,6-tetrachlorohydroquinone + 2 NADP+ + chloride + H2O

(2) 2,3,5,6-tetrachlorophenol + NADPH + H+ + O2 
 
 
 
  2,3,5,6-tetrachlorohydroquinone + NADP+ + H2O
 

Pentachlorophenol monooxygenase is a flavoprotein (FAD).
