Phosphoribokinase

In enzymology, a phosphoribokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + D-ribose 5-phosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + D-ribose 1,5-bisphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-ribose 5-phosphate, whereas its two products are ADP and D-ribose 1,5-bisphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-ribose-5-phosphate 1-phosphotransferase. This enzyme is also called phosphoribokinase (phosphorylating).
