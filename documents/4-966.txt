   Quantum gate      Quantum gate   In quantum computing and specifically the quantum circuit model of computation, a quantum gate (or quantum logic gate ) is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits . They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits.  Unlike many classical logic gates, quantum logic gates are reversible . However, it is possible to perform classical computing using only reversible gates. For example, the reversible Toffoli gate can implement all Boolean functions. This gate has a direct quantum equivalent, showing that quantum circuits can perform all operations performed by classical circuits.  Quantum logic gates are represented by unitary matrices . The most common quantum gates operate on spaces of one or two qubits, just like the common classical logic gates operate on one or two bits. This means that as matrices, quantum gates can be described by 2 × 2 or 4 × 4 unitary matrices.  Commonly used gates  Quantum gates are usually represented as matrices. A gate which acts on k qubits is represented by a 2 k x 2 k unitary matrix. The number of qubits in the input and output of the gate have to be equal. The action of the quantum gate is found by multiplying the matrix representing the gate with the vector which represents the quantum state. In the following, the vector representation of a single qubit is:         v  0    |  0  ⟩    +    v  1    |  1  ⟩     →   [      v  0        v  1      ]      normal-→       subscript  v  0    ket  0       subscript  v  1    ket  1        subscript  v  0      subscript  v  1       v_{0}|0\rangle+v_{1}|1\rangle\rightarrow\begin{bmatrix}v_{0}\\
 v_{1}\end{bmatrix}   , and the vector representation of two qubits is:         v  00    |  00  ⟩    +    v  01    |  01  ⟩    +    v  10    |  10  ⟩    +    v  11    |  11  ⟩     →   [      v  00        v  01        v  10        v  11      ]      normal-→       subscript  v  00    ket  00       subscript  v  01    ket  01       subscript  v  10    ket  10       subscript  v  11    ket  11        subscript  v  00      subscript  v  01      subscript  v  10      subscript  v  11       v_{00}|00\rangle+v_{01}|01\rangle+v_{10}|10\rangle+v_{11}|11\rangle\rightarrow%
 \begin{bmatrix}v_{00}\\
 v_{01}\\
 v_{10}\\
 v_{11}\end{bmatrix}   , where    |   a  b   ⟩     ket    a  b     |ab\rangle   is the state where the first qubit has value a and the second qubit b .  Hadamard gate  The Hadamard gate acts on a single qubit. It maps the basis state    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   to      |  0  ⟩   +   |  1  ⟩     2          ket  0    ket  1      2     \frac{|0\rangle+|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}   and    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   to      |  0  ⟩   -   |  1  ⟩     2          ket  0    ket  1      2     \frac{|0\rangle-|1\rangle}{\sqrt{2}}   and represents a rotation of   π   π   \pi   about the axis     (    x  ^   +   z  ^    )   /   2          normal-^  x    normal-^  z      2     (\hat{x}+\hat{z})/\sqrt{2}   . It is represented by the Hadamard matrix :      H  =    1   2     [     1    1      1     -  1      ]        H      1    2      1  1    1    1        H=\frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}\begin{bmatrix}1&1\\
 1&-1\end{bmatrix}   .  Since     H   H  *    =  I        H   superscript  H     I    HH^{*}=I   where I is the identity matrix, H is indeed a unitary matrix .  Pauli-X gate  The Pauli-X gate acts on a single qubit. It is the quantum equivalent of a NOT gate (with respect to the standard basis    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   ,    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   , which privileges the Z -direction) . It equates to a rotation of the Bloch Sphere around the X-axis by π radians. It maps    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   to    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   and    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   to    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   . It is represented by the Pauli matrix:      X  =   [     0    1      1    0     ]       X    0  1    1  0      X=\begin{bmatrix}0&1\\
 1&0\end{bmatrix}   .  Pauli-Y gate  The Pauli-Y gate acts on a single qubit. It equates to a rotation around the Y-axis of the Bloch Sphere by π radians. It maps    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   to    i   |  1  ⟩       i   ket  1     i|1\rangle   and    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   to    -   i   |  0  ⟩          i   ket  0      -i|0\rangle   . It is represented by the Pauli Y matrix:      Y  =   [     0     -  i       i    0     ]       Y    0    i     i  0      Y=\begin{bmatrix}0&-i\\
 i&0\end{bmatrix}   .  Pauli-Z gate  The Pauli-Z gate acts on a single qubit. It equates to a rotation around the Z-axis of the Bloch Sphere by π radians. Thus, it is a special case of a phase shift gate (next) with θ=π. It leaves the basis state    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   unchanged and maps    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   to    -   |  1  ⟩        ket  1     -|1\rangle   . It is represented by the Pauli Z matrix:      Z  =   [     1    0      0     -  1      ]       Z    1  0    0    1       Z=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
 0&-1\end{bmatrix}   .  Phase shift gates  This is a family of single-qubit gates that leave the basis state    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   unchanged and map    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   to     e   i  ϕ     |  1  ⟩        superscript  e    i  ϕ     ket  1     e^{i\phi}|1\rangle   . The probability of measuring a    |  0  ⟩     ket  0    |0\rangle   or    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   is unchanged after applying this gate, however it modifies the phase of the quantum state. This is equivalent to tracing a horizontal circle (a line of latitude) on the Bloch Sphere by   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   radians.       R  ϕ   =   [     1    0      0     e   i  ϕ       ]        subscript  R  ϕ     1  0    0   superscript  e    i  ϕ        R_{\phi}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
 0&e^{i\phi}\end{bmatrix}     where φ is the phase shift . Some common examples are the    π  8      π  8    \frac{\pi}{8}   gate where φ =    π  4      π  4    \frac{\pi}{4}   , the phase gate where φ =    π  2      π  2    \frac{\pi}{2}   and the Pauli-Z gate where φ = π.  Swap gate  The swap gate swaps two qubits. With respect to the basis    |  00  ⟩     ket  00    |00\rangle   ,    |  01  ⟩     ket  01    |01\rangle   ,    |  10  ⟩     ket  10    |10\rangle   ,    |  11  ⟩     ket  11    |11\rangle   , it is represented by the matrix:      SWAP  =   [     1    0    0    0      0    0    1    0      0    1    0    0      0    0    0    1     ]       SWAP    1  0  0  0    0  0  1  0    0  1  0  0    0  0  0  1      \mbox{SWAP}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\
 0&0&1&0\\
 0&1&0&0\\
 0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}   .  Square root of Swap gate  The sqrt(swap) gate performs half-way of a two-qubit swap. It is universal such that any quantum many qubit gate can be constructed from only sqrt(swap) and single qubit gates.       SWAP   =   [     1    0    0    0      0       1  2     (   1  +  i   )         1  2     (   1  -  i   )      0      0       1  2     (   1  -  i   )         1  2     (   1  +  i   )      0      0    0    0    1     ]         SWAP     1  0  0  0    0      1  2     1  i        1  2     1  i    0    0      1  2     1  i        1  2     1  i    0    0  0  0  1      \sqrt{\mbox{SWAP}}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\
 0&\frac{1}{2}(1+i)&\frac{1}{2}(1-i)&0\\
 0&\frac{1}{2}(1-i)&\frac{1}{2}(1+i)&0\\
 0&0&0&1\end{bmatrix}   .  Controlled gates  Controlled gates act on 2 or more qubits, where one or more qubits act as a control for some operation. For example, the controlled NOT gate (or CNOT) acts on 2 qubits, and performs the NOT operation on the second qubit only when the first qubit is    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   , and otherwise leaves it unchanged. It is represented by the matrix      CNOT  =   [     1    0    0    0      0    1    0    0      0    0    0    1      0    0    1    0     ]       CNOT    1  0  0  0    0  1  0  0    0  0  0  1    0  0  1  0      \mbox{CNOT}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\
 0&1&0&0\\
 0&0&0&1\\
 0&0&1&0\end{bmatrix}   .  More generally if U is a gate that operates on single qubits with matrix representation      U  =   [      x  00      x  01        x  10      x  11      ]       U     subscript  x  00    subscript  x  01      subscript  x  10    subscript  x  11       U=\begin{bmatrix}x_{00}&x_{01}\\
 x_{10}&x_{11}\end{bmatrix}   , then the controlled-U gate is a gate that operates on two qubits in such a way that the first qubit serves as a control. It maps the basis states as follows.       |  00  ⟩   ↦   |  00  ⟩      maps-to   ket  00    ket  00     |00\rangle\mapsto|00\rangle          |  01  ⟩   ↦   |  01  ⟩      maps-to   ket  01    ket  01     |01\rangle\mapsto|01\rangle          |  10  ⟩   ↦    |  1  ⟩   U   |  0  ⟩    =    |  1  ⟩    (     x  00    |  0  ⟩    +    x  10    |  1  ⟩     )         maps-to   ket  10      ket  1   U   ket  0            ket  1        subscript  x  00    ket  0       subscript  x  10    ket  1         |10\rangle\mapsto|1\rangle U|0\rangle=|1\rangle\left(x_{00}|0\rangle+x_{10}|1%
 \rangle\right)          |  11  ⟩   ↦    |  1  ⟩   U   |  1  ⟩    =    |  1  ⟩    (     x  01    |  0  ⟩    +    x  11    |  1  ⟩     )         maps-to   ket  11      ket  1   U   ket  1            ket  1        subscript  x  01    ket  0       subscript  x  11    ket  1         |11\rangle\mapsto|1\rangle U|1\rangle=|1\rangle\left(x_{01}|0\rangle+x_{11}|1%
 \rangle\right)     The matrix representing the controlled U is       C   (  U  )    =   [     1    0    0    0      0    1    0    0      0    0     x  00      x  01       0    0     x  10      x  11      ]         C  U     1  0  0  0    0  1  0  0    0  0   subscript  x  00    subscript  x  01     0  0   subscript  x  10    subscript  x  11       \mbox{C}(U)=\begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0\\
 0&1&0&0\\
 0&0&x_{00}&x_{01}\\
 0&0&x_{10}&x_{11}\end{bmatrix}   .  When U is one of the Pauli matrices , σ x , σ y , or σ z , the respective terms "controlled- X ", "controlled- Y ", or "controlled- Z " are sometimes used. 1  Toffoli gate  The Toffoli gate, also CCNOT gate, is a 3-bit gate, which is universal for classical computation. The quantum Toffoli gate is the same gate, defined for 3 qubits. If the first two bits are in the state    |  1  ⟩     ket  1    |1\rangle   , it applies a Pauli-X on the third bit, else it does nothing. It is an example of a controlled gate. Since it is the quantum analog of a classical gate, it is completely specified by its truth table.      Truth table   Matrix form          INPUT   OUTPUT       0   0     0   0     0   1     0   1     1   0     1   0     1   1     1   1          [     1    0    0    0    0    0    0    0      0    1    0    0    0    0    0    0      0    0    1    0    0    0    0    0      0    0    0    1    0    0    0    0      0    0    0    0    1    0    0    0      0    0    0    0    0    1    0    0      0    0    0    0    0    0    0    1      0    0    0    0    0    0    1    0     ]      1  0  0  0  0  0  0  0    0  1  0  0  0  0  0  0    0  0  1  0  0  0  0  0    0  0  0  1  0  0  0  0    0  0  0  0  1  0  0  0    0  0  0  0  0  1  0  0    0  0  0  0  0  0  0  1    0  0  0  0  0  0  1  0     \begin{bmatrix}1&0&0&0&0&0&0&0\\

 \end{bmatrix}        It can be also described as the gate which maps    |   a  ,  b  ,  c   ⟩     ket   a  b  c     |a,b,c\rangle   to    |   a  ,  b  ,   c  ⊕   a  b     ⟩     ket   a  b   direct-sum  c    a  b       |a,b,c\oplus ab\rangle   .  Fredkin gate  The Fredkin gate (also CSWAP gate) is a 3-bit gate that performs a controlled  swap . It is universal for classical computation. It has the useful property that the numbers of 0s and 1s are conserved throughout, which in the billiard ball model means the same number of balls are output as input.

 \end{bmatrix}        Universal quantum gates  Informally, a set of universal quantum gates is any set of gates to which any operation possible on a quantum computer can be reduced, that is, any other unitary operation can be expressed as a finite sequence of gates from the set. Technically, this is impossible since the number of possible quantum gates is uncountable , whereas the number of finite sequences from a finite set is countable . To solve this problem, we only require that any quantum operation can be approximated by a sequence of gates from this finite set. Moreover, for the specific case of single qubit unitaries the Solovay–Kitaev theorem guarantees that this can be done efficiently.  One simple set of two-qubit universal quantum gates is the Hadamard gate (   H   H   H   ), the    π  /  8      π  8    \pi/8   gate    R   (   π  /  4   )       R    π  4     R(\pi/4)   , and the controlled NOT gate.  A single-gate set of universal quantum gates can also be formulated using the three-qubit Deutsch gate    D   (  θ  )       D  θ    D(\theta)   , which performs the transformation 2       |   a  ,  b  ,  c   ⟩   ↦   {       i   cos   (  θ  )     |   a  ,  b  ,  c   ⟩    +    sin   (  θ  )     |   a  ,  b  ,   1  -  c    ⟩         for  a   =  b  =  1        |   a  ,  b  ,  c   ⟩     otherwise.         maps-to   ket   a  b  c     cases      i    θ    ket   a  b  c         θ    ket   a  b    1  c             for  a   b       1     ket   a  b  c    otherwise.     |a,b,c\rangle\mapsto\begin{cases}i\cos(\theta)|a,b,c\rangle+\sin(\theta)|a,b,1%
 -c\rangle&\mbox{for }a=b=1\\
 |a,b,c\rangle&\mbox{otherwise.}\end{cases}     The universal classical logic gate, the Toffoli gate , is reducible to the Deutsch gate,    D   (      π  2      )       D      π  2       D(\begin{matrix}\frac{\pi}{2}\end{matrix})   , thus showing that all classical logic operations can be performed on a universal quantum computer.
