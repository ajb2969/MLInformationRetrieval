Quantum gate

In quantum computing and specifically the quantum circuit model of computation, a quantum gate (or quantum logic gate) is a basic quantum circuit operating on a small number of qubits. They are the building blocks of quantum circuits, like classical logic gates are for conventional digital circuits.
Unlike many classical logic gates, quantum logic gates are reversible. However, it is possible to perform classical computing using only reversible gates. For example, the reversible Toffoli gate can implement all Boolean functions. This gate has a direct quantum equivalent, showing that quantum circuits can perform all operations performed by classical circuits.
Quantum logic gates are represented by unitary matrices. The most common quantum gates operate on spaces of one or two qubits, just like the common classical logic gates operate on one or two bits. This means that as matrices, quantum gates can be described by 2 × 2 or 4 × 4 unitary matrices.
Commonly used gates
Quantum gates are usually represented as matrices. A gate which acts on k qubits is represented by a 2k x 2k unitary matrix. The number of qubits in the input and output of the gate have to be equal. The action of the quantum gate is found by multiplying the matrix representing the gate with the vector which represents the quantum state. In the following, the vector representation of a single qubit is:


 
 , and the vector representation of two qubits is:


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the state where the first qubit has value a and the second qubit b.
Hadamard gate
The Hadamard gate acts on a single qubit. It maps the basis state 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and represents a rotation of 
 
 
 
  about the axis 
 
 
 
 . It is represented by the Hadamard matrix: 


 
 .
Since 
 
 
 
  where I is the identity matrix, H is indeed a unitary matrix.
Pauli-X gate
The Pauli-X gate acts on a single qubit. It is the quantum equivalent of a NOT gate (with respect to the standard basis 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , which privileges the Z-direction) . It equates to a rotation of the Bloch Sphere around the X-axis by π radians. It maps 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . It is represented by the Pauli matrix:


 
 .
Pauli-Y gate
The Pauli-Y gate acts on a single qubit. It equates to a rotation around the Y-axis of the Bloch Sphere by π radians. It maps 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . It is represented by the Pauli Y matrix:


 
 .
Pauli-Z gate
The Pauli-Z gate acts on a single qubit. It equates to a rotation around the Z-axis of the Bloch Sphere by π radians. Thus, it is a special case of a phase shift gate (next) with θ=π. It leaves the basis state 
 
 
 
  unchanged and maps 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . It is represented by the Pauli Z matrix:


 
 .
Phase shift gates
This is a family of single-qubit gates that leave the basis state 
 
 
 
  unchanged and map 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . The probability of measuring a 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is unchanged after applying this gate, however it modifies the phase of the quantum state. This is equivalent to tracing a horizontal circle (a line of latitude) on the Bloch Sphere by 
 
 
 
  radians.



where φ is the phase shift. Some common examples are the 
 
 
 
  gate where φ = 
 
 
 
 , the phase gate where φ = 
 
 
 
  and the Pauli-Z gate where φ = π.
Swap gate
 The swap gate swaps two qubits. With respect to the basis 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , it is represented by the matrix:


 
 .
Square root of Swap gate
 The sqrt(swap) gate performs half-way of a two-qubit swap. It is universal such that any quantum many qubit gate can be constructed from only sqrt(swap) and single qubit gates.


 
 .
Controlled gates
 Controlled gates act on 2 or more qubits, where one or more qubits act as a control for some operation. For example, the controlled NOT gate (or CNOT) acts on 2 qubits, and performs the NOT operation on the second qubit only when the first qubit is 
 
 
 
 , and otherwise leaves it unchanged. It is represented by the matrix


 
 .
More generally if U is a gate that operates on single qubits with matrix representation


 
 , then the controlled-U gate is a gate that operates on two qubits in such a way that the first qubit serves as a control. It maps the basis states as follows. 












The matrix representing the controlled U is


 
 .
When U is one of the Pauli matrices, σx, σy, or σz, the respective terms "controlled-X", "controlled-Y", or "controlled-Z" are sometimes used.1
Toffoli gate
 The Toffoli gate, also CCNOT gate, is a 3-bit gate, which is universal for classical computation. The quantum Toffoli gate is the same gate, defined for 3 qubits. If the first two bits are in the state 
 
 
 
 , it applies a Pauli-X on the third bit, else it does nothing. It is an example of a controlled gate. Since it is the quantum analog of a classical gate, it is completely specified by its truth table.

It can be also described as the gate which maps

 .
Fredkin gate
 The Fredkin gate (also CSWAP gate) is a 3-bit gate that performs a controlled swap. It is universal for classical computation. It has the useful property that the numbers of 0s and 1s are conserved throughout, which in the billiard ball model means the same number of balls are output as input.

Universal quantum gates
Informally, a set of universal quantum gates is any set of gates to which any operation possible on a quantum computer can be reduced, that is, any other unitary operation can be expressed as a finite sequence of gates from the set. Technically, this is impossible since the number of possible quantum gates is uncountable, whereas the number of finite sequences from a finite set is countable. To solve this problem, we only require that any quantum operation can be approximated by a sequence of gates from this finite set. Moreover, for the specific case of single qubit unitaries the Solovay–Kitaev theorem guarantees that this can be done efficiently.
One simple set of two-qubit universal quantum gates is the Hadamard gate (
 
 
 
 ), the 
 
 
 
  gate 
 
 
 
 , and the controlled NOT gate.
A single-gate set of universal quantum gates can also be formulated using the three-qubit Deutsch gate 
 
 
 
 , which performs the transformation2



The universal classical logic gate, the Toffoli gate, is reducible to the Deutsch gate, 
 
 
 
 , thus showing that all classical logic operations can be performed on a universal quantum computer.
History
The current notation for quantum gates was developed by Barenco et al.,3 building on notation introduced by Feynman.4
