   Thomas' cyclically symmetric attractor      Thomas' cyclically symmetric attractor  [[File: Thomas' cyclically symmetric attractor.png|thumb|Thomas' cyclically symmetric attractor.]]In the dynamical systems theory , Thomas' cyclically symmetric attractor is a 3D strange attractor originally proposed by René Thomas . 1 It has a simple form which is cyclically symmetric in the x,y, and z variables and can be viewed as the trajectory of a frictionally dampened particle moving in a 3D lattice of forces. 2 The simple form has made it a popular example.  It is described by the differential equations        d  x    d  t    =    sin   (  y  )    -   b  x            d  x     d  t        y     b  x      \frac{dx}{dt}=\sin(y)-bx           d  y    d  t    =    sin   (  z  )    -   b  y            d  y     d  t        z     b  y      \frac{dy}{dt}=\sin(z)-by           d  z    d  t    =    sin   (  x  )    -   b  z            d  z     d  t        x     b  z      \frac{dz}{dt}=\sin(x)-bz   where   b   b   b   is a constant.     b   b   b   corresponds to how dissipative the system is, and acts as a bifurcation parameter. For    b  >  1      b  1    b>1   the origin is the single stable equilibrium. At    b  =  1      b  1    b=1   it undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation , splitting into two attractive fixed points. As the parameter is decreased further they undergo a Hopf bifurcation at    b  ≈  0.32899      b  0.32899    b\approx 0.32899   , creating a stable limit cycle. The limit cycle the undergoes a period doubling cascade and becomes chaotic at    b  ≈  0.208186      b  0.208186    b\approx 0.208186   . Beyond this the attractor expands, undergoing a series of crises (up to six separate attractors can coexist for certain values). The fractal dimension of the attractor increases towards 3. 3  In the limit    b  =  0      b  0    b=0   the system lacks dissipation and the trajectory ergodically wanders the entire space (with an exception for 1.67%, where it drifts parallel to one of the coordinate axes: this corresponds to quasiperiodic torii). The dynamics has been described as deterministic fractional Brownian motion , and exhibits anomalous diffusion . 4 5  References  "  Category:Nonlinear systems  Category:Dynamical systems     ↩  ↩    ↩
