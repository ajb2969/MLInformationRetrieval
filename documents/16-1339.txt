[[File:

It is described by the differential equations








 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a constant.


 
  corresponds to how dissipative the system is, and acts as a bifurcation parameter. For 
 
 
 
  the origin is the single stable equilibrium. At 
 
 
 
  it undergoes a pitchfork bifurcation, splitting into two attractive fixed points. As the parameter is decreased further they undergo a Hopf bifurcation at 
 
 
 
 , creating a stable limit cycle. The limit cycle the undergoes a period doubling cascade and becomes chaotic at 
 
 
 
 . Beyond this the attractor expands, undergoing a series of crises (up to six separate attractors can coexist for certain values). The fractal dimension of the attractor increases towards 3.3
In the limit 
 
 
 
  the system lacks dissipation and the trajectory ergodically wanders the entire space (with an exception for 1.67%, where it drifts parallel to one of the coordinate axes: this corresponds to quasiperiodic torii). The dynamics has been described as deterministic fractional Brownian motion, and exhibits anomalous diffusion.45
