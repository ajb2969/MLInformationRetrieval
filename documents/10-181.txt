   Kachurovskii's theorem      Kachurovskii's theorem   In mathematics , Kachurovskii's theorem is a theorem relating the convexity of a function on a Banach space to the monotonicity of its Fréchet derivative .  Statement of the theorem  Let K be a convex subset of a Banach space V and let f : K → R ∪ {+∞} be an extended real-valued function that is Fréchet differentiable with derivative d f ( x ) : V → R at each point x in K . (In fact, d f ( x ) is an element of the continuous dual space  V ∗ .) Then the following are equivalent:   f is a convex function;    for all x and y in K ,           d  f   (  x  )    (   y  -  x   )    ≤    f   (  y  )    -   f   (  x  )      ;        normal-d  f  x    y  x        f  y     f  x      \mathrm{d}f(x)(y-x)\leq f(y)-f(x);         d f is an (increasing) monotone operator, i.e., for all x and y in K ,           (    d  f   (  x  )    -   d  f   (  y  )     )    (   x  -  y   )    ≥  0.            normal-d  f  x     normal-d  f  y      x  y    0.    \big(\mathrm{d}f(x)-\mathrm{d}f(y)\big)(x-y)\geq 0.
