   Williams–Landel–Ferry equation      Williams–Landel–Ferry equation   The Williams– Landel – Ferry Equation (or WLF Equation ) is an empirical equation associated with time–temperature superposition . 1  The WLF equation has the form       log   (   a  T   )    =    -    C  1    (   T  -   T  r    )       C  2   +   (   T  -   T  r    )            subscript  a  T           subscript  C  1     T   subscript  T  normal-r         subscript  C  2     T   subscript  T  normal-r        \log(a_{T})=\frac{-C_{1}(T-T_{\mathrm{r}})}{C_{2}+(T-T_{\mathrm{r}})}   where T is the temperature, T r is a reference temperature chosen to construct the compliance master curve and C 1 , C 2 are empirical constants adjusted to fit the values of the superposition parameter a T .  The equation can be used to fit (regress) discrete values of the shift factor a T vs. temperature. Here, values of shift factor a T are obtained by horizontal shift log(a T ) of creep compliance data plotted vs. time or frequency in double logarithmic scale so that a data set obtained experimentally at temperature T superposes with the data set at temperature T r . A minimum of three values of a T are needed to obtain C 1 , C 2 , and typically more than three are used.  Once constructed, the WLF equation allows for the estimation of the temperature shift factor for temperatures other than those for which the material was tested. In this way, the master curve can be applied to other temperatures. However, when the constants are obtained with data at temperatures above the glass transition temperature (T g ), the WLF equation is applicable to temperatures at or above T g only; the constants are positive and represent Arrhenius behavior. Extrapolation to temperatures below T g is erroneous. 2 When the constants are obtained with data at temperatures below T g , negative values of C 1 , C 2 are obtained, which are not applicable above T g and do not represent Arrhenius behavior. Therefore, the constants obtained above T g are not useful for predicting the response of the polymer for structural applications, which necessarily must operate at temperatures below T g .  The WLF equation is a consequence of time–temperature superposition (TTSP), which mathematically is an application of Boltzmann's superposition principle. It is TTSP, not WLF, that allows the assembly of a compliance master curve that spans more time, or frequency, than afforded by the time available for experimentation or the frequency range of the instrumentation, such as dynamic mechanical analyzer (DMA) .  While the time span of a TTSP master curve is broad, according to Struik, 3 it is valid only if the data sets did not suffer from ageing effects during the test time. Even then, the master curve represents a hypothetical material that does not age. Effective Time Theory. 4 needs to be used to obtain useful prediction for long term time. 5  Having data above T g , it is possible to predict the behavior (compliance, storage modulus , etc.) of viscoelastic materials for temperatures T>T g , and/or for times/frequencies longer/slower than the time available for experimentation. With the master curve and associated WLF equation it is possible to predict the mechanical properties of the polymer out of time scale of the machine (typically    10   -  2      superscript  10    2     10^{-2}   to    10  2     superscript  10  2    10^{2}   Hz), thus extrapolating the results of multi-frequency analysis to a broader range, out of measurement range of machine.
