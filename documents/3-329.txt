   Maximal torus      Maximal torus   In the mathematical theory of compact Lie groups a special role is played by torus subgroups, in particular by the maximal torus subgroups.  A torus in a compact Lie group  G is a compact , connected , abelian  Lie subgroup of G (and therefore isomorphic to the standard torus T n ). A maximal torus is one which is maximal among such subgroups. That is, T is a maximal torus if for any other torus T ‚Ä≤ containing T we have T = T ‚Ä≤. Every torus is contained in a maximal torus simply by dimensional considerations. A noncompact Lie group need not have any nontrivial tori (e.g. R n ).  The dimension of a maximal torus in G is called the rank of G . The rank is well-defined since all maximal tori turn out to be conjugate . For semisimple groups the rank is equal to the number of nodes in the associated Dynkin diagram .  Examples  The unitary group U( n ) has as a maximal torus the subgroup of all diagonal matrices . That is,       T  =   {   diag   (   e   i   Œ∏  1     ,   e   i   Œ∏  2     ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   e   i   Œ∏  n     )    :     ‚àÄ  j   ,   Œ∏  j    ‚àà  ‚Ñù   }    .      T   conditional-set    diag    superscript  e    i   subscript  Œ∏  1      superscript  e    i   subscript  Œ∏  2     normal-‚Ä¶   superscript  e    i   subscript  Œ∏  n           for-all  j    subscript  Œ∏  j    ‚Ñù      T=\left\{\mathrm{diag}(e^{i\theta_{1}},e^{i\theta_{2}},\dots,e^{i\theta_{n}}):%
 \forall j,\theta_{j}\in\mathbb{R}\right\}.    T is clearly isomorphic to the product of n circles, so the unitary group U( n ) has rank n . A maximal torus in the special unitary group SU( n ) ‚äÇ U( n ) is just the intersection of T and SU( n ) which is a torus of dimension n ‚àí 1.  A maximal torus in the special orthogonal group SO(2 n ) is given by the set of all simultaneous rotations in n pairwise orthogonal 2-planes. This is also a maximal torus in the group SO(2 n +1) where the action fixes the remaining direction. Thus both SO(2 n ) and SO(2 n +1) have rank n . For example, in the rotation group SO(3) the maximal tori are given by rotations about a fixed axis.  The symplectic group Sp( n ) has rank n . A maximal torus is given by the set of all diagonal matrices whose entries all lie in a fixed complex subalgebra of H .  Properties  Let G be a compact, connected Lie group and let   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   be the Lie algebra of G .   A maximal torus in G is a maximal abelian subgroup, but the converse need not hold.  The maximal tori in G are exactly the Lie subgroups corresponding to the maximal abelian, diagonally acting subalgebras of   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   (cf. Cartan subalgebra )  Given a maximal torus T in G , every element g ‚àà G is conjugate to an element in T .  Since the conjugate of a maximal torus is a maximal torus, every element of G lies in some maximal torus.  All maximal tori in G are conjugate . Therefore, the maximal tori form a single conjugacy class among the subgroups of G .  It follows that the dimensions of all maximal tori are the same. This dimension is the rank of G .  If G has dimension n and rank r then n ‚àí r is even.   Weyl group  Given a torus T (not necessarily maximal), the Weyl group of G with respect to T can be defined as the normalizer of T modulo the centralizer of T . That is,      W   (  T  ,  G  )    :=      N  G    (  T  )    /   C  G     (  T  )     .     assign    W   T  G           subscript  N  G   T    subscript  C  G    T     W(T,G):=N_{G}(T)/C_{G}(T).   Fix a maximal torus    T  =   T  0       T   subscript  T  0     T=T_{0}   in G; then the corresponding Weyl group is called the Weyl group of G (it depends up to isomorphism on the choice of T ). The representation theory of G is essentially determined by T and W .   The Weyl group acts by ( outer ) automorphisms on T (and its Lie algebra).  The centralizer of T in G is equal to T , so the Weyl group is equal to N ( T )/ T .  The identity component of the normalizer of T is also equal to T . The Weyl group is therefore equal to the component group of N ( T ).  The normalizer of T is closed , so the Weyl group is finite  Two elements in T are conjugate if and only if they are conjugate by an element of W . That is, the conjugacy classes of G intersect T in a Weyl orbit .  The space of conjugacy classes in G is homeomorphic to the orbit space  T / W and, if f is a continuous function on G invariant under conjugation, the Weyl integration formula holds:             ‚à´  G     f   (  g  )   d  g    =     |  W  |    -  1       ‚à´  T     f   (  t  )      |   Œî   (  t  )    |   2    d  t      ,        subscript   G     f  g  d  g       superscript    W     1      subscript   T     f  t   superscript      normal-Œî  t    2   d  t       \displaystyle{\int_{G}f(g)\,dg=|W|^{-1}\int_{T}f(t)|\Delta(t)|^{2}\,dt,}         where Œî is given by the Weyl denominator formula .
