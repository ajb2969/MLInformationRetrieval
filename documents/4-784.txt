   Entropy of fusion      Entropy of fusion   The entropy of fusion is the increase in entropy when melting a substance. This is almost always positive since the degree of disorder increases in the transition from an organized crystalline  solid to the disorganized structure of a liquid ; the only known exception is helium . It is denoted as ΔS fus and normally expressed in J  mol −1  K −1  A natural process such as a phase transition will occur when the associated change in the Gibbs free energy is negative.       Δ   G   f  u  s     =    Δ   H   f  u  s     -    T  ×  Δ    S   f  u  s      <  0          normal-Δ   subscript  G    f  u  s         normal-Δ   subscript  H    f  u  s         T  normal-Δ    subscript  S    f  u  s           0     \Delta G_{fus}=\Delta H_{fus}-T\times\Delta S_{fus}<0   , where    Δ   H   f  u  s        normal-Δ   subscript  H    f  u  s      \Delta H_{fus}   is the enthalpy or heat of fusion . Since this is a thermodynamic equation, the symbol T refers to the absolute thermodynamic temperature , measured in Kelvin (K).  Equilibrium occurs when the temperature is equal to the melting point     T  =   T  f       T   subscript  T  f     T=T_{f}   so that       Δ   G   f  u  s     =    Δ   H   f  u  s     -     T  f   ×  Δ    S   f  u  s      =  0          normal-Δ   subscript  G    f  u  s         normal-Δ   subscript  H    f  u  s          subscript  T  f   normal-Δ    subscript  S    f  u  s           0     \Delta G_{fus}=\Delta H_{fus}-T_{f}\times\Delta S_{fus}=0   ,  and the entropy of fusion is the heat of fusion divided by the melting point.       Δ   S   f  u  s     =    Δ   H   f  u  s      T  f          normal-Δ   subscript  S    f  u  s         normal-Δ   subscript  H    f  u  s      subscript  T  f      \Delta S_{fus}=\frac{\Delta H_{fus}}{T_{f}}     Helium  Helium-3 has a negative entropy of fusion at temperatures below 0.3 K. Helium-4 also has a very slightly negative entropy of fusion below 0.8 K. This means that, at appropriate constant pressures, these substances freeze with the addition of heat.
