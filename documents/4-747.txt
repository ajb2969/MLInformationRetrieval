   Inverse system      Inverse system   In mathematics , an inverse system in a category  C is a functor from a small cofiltered category  I to C . An inverse system is sometimes called a pro-object in C . The dual concept is a direct system .  The category of inverse systems  Pro-objects in C form a category pro-C . The general definition was given by Alexander Grothendieck in 1959, in TDTE . 1  Two inverse systems   F :I   →   normal-→   \to   C''   and  G :J   →   normal-→   \to   C'' determine a functor   I op x J    →   normal-→   \to    Sets ,   namely the functor       Hom  C    (   F   (  i  )    ,   G   (  j  )    )        subscript  Hom  C      F  i     G  j      \mathrm{Hom}_{C}(F(i),G(j))   .  The set of homomorphisms between F and G in pro-C is defined to be the colimit of this functor in the first variable, followed by the limit in the second variable.  If C has all inverse limits , then the limit defines a functor pro-C    →   normal-→   \to    C . In practice, e.g. if C is a category of algebraic or topological objects, this functor is not an equivalence of categories.  Direct systems/Ind-objects  An ind-object in C is a pro-object in C op . The category of ind-objects is written ind-C .  Examples   If C is the category of finite groups, then pro-C is equivalent to the category of profinite groups and continuous homomorphisms between them.    If C is the category of finitely generated groups, then ind-C is equivalent to the category of all groups.   References    .
