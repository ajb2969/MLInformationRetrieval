   Noncommutative torus      Noncommutative torus   In mathematics , and more specifically in the theory of C*-algebras , the noncommutative tori  A Œ∏ (also known as irrational rotation algebras when Œ∏ is irrational) are a family of noncommutative C*-algebras which generalize the algebra of continuous functions on the 2-torus . Many topological and geometric properties of the classical 2-torus have algebraic analogues for the noncommutative tori, and as such they are fundamental examples of a noncommutative space in the sense of Alain Connes .  Definition  For any irrational number Œ∏ , the noncommutative torus A Œ∏ is the C*-subalgebra of    B   (    L  2    (  ùïã  )    )       B     superscript  L  2   ùïã     B(L^{2}(\mathbb{T}))   , the algebra of bounded linear operators of square-integrable functions on the unit circle of   ‚ÑÇ   ‚ÑÇ   \mathbb{C}   generated by unitary elements   U   U   U   and   V   V   V   , where     U   (  f  )    (  z  )    =   z  f   (  z  )          U  f  z     z  f  z     U(f)(z)=zf(z)   and     V   (  f  )    (  z  )    =   f   (    e   -   2  œÄ  i  Œ∏     z   )          V  f  z     f     superscript  e      2  œÄ  i  Œ∏     z      V(f)(z)=f(e^{-2\pi i\theta}z)   . A quick calculation shows that     V  U   =    e   -   2  œÄ  i  Œ∏     U  V         V  U      superscript  e      2  œÄ  i  Œ∏     U  V     VU=e^{-2\pi i\theta}UV   . 1  Alternative characterizations   Universal property:  A Œ∏ can be defined (up to isomorphism) as the universal C*-algebra generated by two unitary elements U and V satisfying the relation      V  U   =    e   2  œÄ  i  Œ∏    U  V    .        V  U      superscript  e    2  œÄ  i  Œ∏    U  V     VU=e^{2\pi i\theta}UV.    2 This definition extends to the case when Œ∏ is rational. In particular when Œ∏ =¬†0, A Œ∏ is isomorphic to continuous functions on the 2-torus by the Gelfand transform .  Irrational rotation algebra: Let the infinite cyclic group Z act on the circle S 1 by the rotation action by angle 2   œÄ   œÄ   \pi    iŒ∏ . This induces an action of Z by automorphisms on the algebra of continuous functions C ( S 1 ). The resulting C*- crossed product  C ( S 1 ) ‚ãä Z is isomorphic to A Œ∏ . The generating unitaries are the generator of the group Z and the identity function on the circle z : S 1 ‚Üí C . 3  Twisted group algebra: The function œÉ : Z 2 √ó Z 2 ‚Üí C ; œÉ(( m , n ), ( p , q )) = e 2œÄ inpŒ∏ is a group 2-cocycle on Z 2 , and the corresponding twisted group algebra C* ( Z 2 ; œÉ ) is isomorphic to A Œ∏ .   Classification and K-theory  The K-theory of A Œ∏ is Z 2 in both even dimension and odd dimension, and so does not distinguish the irrational rotation algebras. But as ordered groups, K 0 ‚âÉ Z + Œ∏ Z . Therefore, two noncommutative tori    A  Œ∏     subscript  A  Œ∏    A_{\theta}   and    A  Œ∑     subscript  A  Œ∑    A_{\eta}   are isomorphic if and only if either Œ∏ + Œ∑ or Œ∏ ‚àí Œ∑ is an integer. 4 5  Two irrational rotation algebras A Œ∏ and A Œ∑ are strongly Morita equivalent if and only if Œ∏ and Œ∑ are in the same orbit of the action of SL(2, Z ) on R by fractional linear transformations . In particular, the noncommutative tori with Œ∏ rational are Morita equivalent to the classical torus. On the other hand, the noncommutative tori with Œ∏ irrational are simple C*-algebras. 6  References    "  Category:C*-algebras     ‚Ü©     ‚Ü©
