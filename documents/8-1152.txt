Circulation problem

The circulation problem and its variants are a generalisation of network flow problems, with the added constraint of a lower bound on edge flows, and with flow conservation also being required for the source and sink (i.e. there are no special nodes). In variants of the problem, you have multiple commodities flowing through the network, and a cost on the flow.
Definition
Given flow network 
 
 
 
  with:


 
 , lower bound on flow from node 
 
 
 
  to node 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 , upper bound on flow from node 
 
 
 
  to node 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 , cost of a unit of flow on 
 
 

and the constraints:


 
 ,


 
  (flow cannot appear or disappear in nodes).
Finding a flow assignment satisfying the constraints gives a solution to the given circulation problem.
In the minimum cost variant of the problem, minimize



Multi-commodity circulation
In a multi-commodity circulation problem, you also need to keep track of the flow of the individual commodities:










The flow of commodity 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .







The total flow.





There is also a lower bound on each flow of commodity.














The conservation constraint must be upheld individually for the commodities:



Solution
For the circulation problem, many polynomial algorithms have been developed (e.g., Edmonds and Karp, 1972; Tarjan 1987-1988). Tardos found the first strongly polynomial algorithm.1
For the case of multiple commodities, the problem is NP-complete for integer flows.2 For fractional flows, it is solvable in polynomial time, as one can formulate the problem as a linear program.
