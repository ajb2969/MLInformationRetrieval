Barrett reduction

In modular arithmetic, Barrett reduction is a reduction algorithm introduced in 1986 by P.D. Barrett.1 A naive way of computing



would be to use a fast division algorithm. Barrett reduction is an algorithm designed to optimize this operation assuming 
 
 
 
  is constant, and 
 
 
 
  be the inverse of 
 
 
 
  as a floating point number. Then



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the floor function. The result is exact, as long as m is computed with sufficient accuracy.
Barrett algorithm
Barrett algorithm is a fixed-point analog which expresses everything in terms of integers. Let k be the smallest integer such that 
 
 
 
 . Think of n as representing the fixed-point number 
 
 
 
 . We precompute m such that 
 
 
 
 . Then m represents the fixed-point number 
 
 
 
 .
Let



 
  and


 
 .

Because of the floor function, 
 
 
 
  is an integer and 
 
 
 
 . Also, if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 . In that case
