   Deoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase      Deoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase   In enzymology , a deoxyribodipyrimidine photo-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cyclobutadipyrimidine (in DNA)   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 pyrimidine residues (in DNA)   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , cyclobutadipyrimidine (in DNA) , and one product , pyrimidine residues (in DNA) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically in the "catch-all" class of carbon-carbon lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deoxyribocyclobutadipyrimidine pyrimidine-lyase . Other names in common use include photoreactivating enzyme , DNA photolyase , DNA-photoreactivating enzyme , DNA cyclobutane dipyrimidine photolyase , DNA photolyase , deoxyribonucleic photolyase , deoxyribodipyrimidine photolyase , photolyase , PRE , PhrB photolyase , deoxyribonucleic cyclobutane dipyrimidine photolyase , phr A photolyase , dipyrimidine photolyase (photosensitive) , and deoxyribonucleate pyrimidine dimer lyase (photosensitive) . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and 5,10-Methenyltetrahydrofolate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 14 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
