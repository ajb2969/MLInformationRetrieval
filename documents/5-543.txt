Hertz in 1894 from the Greek ὅλος meaning whole, entire and νόμ-ος meaning law) may refer to:  Mathematics   Holonomic basis , a set of basis vector fields { e k } such that some coordinate system { x k } exists for which     e  k   =   ∂   ∂   x  k          subscript  e  k         superscript  x  k       e_{k}={\partial\over\partial x^{k}}     Holonomic constraints , which are expressible as a function of the coordinates    x  j     subscript  x  j    x_{j}\,\!   and time   t   t   t\,\!     Holonomic module in the theory of D-modules  Holonomic function , a smooth function in several variables that is a solution of a system of linear homogeneous differential equations with polynomial coefficients   Other uses   Holonomic (robotics) , when controllable degrees of freedom are equal to the total degrees of freedom.
