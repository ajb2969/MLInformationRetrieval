   Indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADPH)      Indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADPH)   In enzymology , an indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (indol-3-yl)ethanol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (indol-3-yl)ethanol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are (indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (indol-3-yl)ethanol:NADP + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include indoleacetaldehyde (reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide , phosphate) reductase , indole-3-acetaldehyde reductase (NADPH) , and indole-3-ethanol:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
