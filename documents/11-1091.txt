Glycine—oxaloacetate transaminase




Glycine—oxaloacetate transaminase

In enzymology, a glycine-oxaloacetate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

glycine + oxaloacetate 
 
 
 
  glyoxylate + L-aspartate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are glycine and oxaloacetate, whereas its two products are glyoxylate and L-aspartate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the transaminases, which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glycine:oxaloacetate aminotransferase. This enzyme is also called glycine-oxaloacetate aminotransferase. It employs one cofactor, pyridoxal phosphate.
