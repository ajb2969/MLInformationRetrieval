Adenosylcobinamide-GDP ribazoletransferase

Adenosylcobinamide-GDP ribazoletransferase (, CobS, cobalamin synthase, cobalamin-5'-phosphate synthase, cobalamin (5'-phosphate) synthase) is an enzyme with system name adenosylcobinamide-GDP:alpha-ribazole ribazoletransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) adenosylcobinamide-GDP + alpha-ribazole 
 
 
 
  GMP + adenosylcobalamin

(2) adenosylcobinamide-GDP + alpha-ribazole 5'-phosphate 
 
 
 
  GMP + adenosylcobalamin 5'-phosphate
