   Looman–Menchoff theorem      Looman–Menchoff theorem   In the mathematical field of complex analysis , the Looman–Menchoff theorem states that a continuous  complex -valued function defined in an open set of the complex plane is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations . It is thus a generalization of a theorem by Goursat , which instead of assuming the continuity of f , assumes its Fréchet differentiability when regarded as a function from a subset of R 2 to R 2 .  A complete statement of the theorem is as follows:   Let Ω be an open set in C and f : Ω → C a continuous function. Suppose that the partial derivatives      ∂  f   /   ∂  x         f     x     \partial f/\partial x   and     ∂  f   /   ∂  y         f     y     \partial f/\partial y   exist everywhere but a countable set in Ω. Then f is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation:           ∂  f    ∂   z  ¯     =    1  2    (     ∂  f    ∂  x    +   i    ∂  f    ∂  y      )    =  0.            f      normal-¯  z         1  2         f     x      i      f     y            0.     \frac{\partial f}{\partial\bar{z}}=\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial
 x%
 }+i\frac{\partial f}{\partial y}\right)=0.        References    .   .   .   .   .   "  Category:Theorems in complex analysis
