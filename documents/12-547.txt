Looman–Menchoff theorem

In the mathematical field of complex analysis, the Looman–Menchoff theorem states that a continuous complex-valued function defined in an open set of the complex plane is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equations. It is thus a generalization of a theorem by Goursat, which instead of assuming the continuity of f, assumes its Fréchet differentiability when regarded as a function from a subset of R2 to R2.
A complete statement of the theorem is as follows:

Let Ω be an open set in C and f : Ω → C a continuous function. Suppose that the partial derivatives

 
  and 
 
 
 
  exist everywhere but a countable set in Ω. Then f is holomorphic if and only if it satisfies the Cauchy–Riemann equation:
