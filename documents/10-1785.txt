Phosphosulfolactate synthase




Phosphosulfolactate synthase

In enzymology, a phosphosulfolactate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(2R)-2-O-phospho-3-sulfolactate 
 
 
 
  phosphoenolpyruvate + hydrogen sulfite
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, (2R)-2-O-phospho-3-sulfolactate, and two products, phosphoenolpyruvate and hydrogen sulfite.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (2R)-2-O-phospho-3-sulfolactate hydrogen-sulfite-lyase (phosphoenolpyruvate-forming). Other names in common use include (2R)-phospho-3-sulfolactate synthase, and (2R)-O-phospho-3-sulfolactate sulfo-lyase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
