Threonine—tRNA ligase




Threonine—tRNA ligase

In enzymology, a threonine-tRNA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-threonine + tRNAThr 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + L-threonyl-tRNAThr
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP, L-threonine, and tRNA(Thr), whereas its 3 products are AMP, diphosphate, and L-threonyl-tRNA(Thr).
This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases, to be specific those forming carbon-oxygen bonds in aminoacyl-tRNA and related compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-threonine:tRNAThr ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include threonyl-tRNA synthetase, threonyl-transfer ribonucleate synthetase, threonyl-transfer RNA synthetase, threonyl-transfer ribonucleic acid synthetase, threonyl ribonucleic synthetase, threonine-transfer ribonucleate synthetase, threonine translase, threonyl-tRNA synthetase, and TRS. This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism and aminoacyl-trna biosynthesis.
