Forbidden subgraph problem

In extremal graph theory, the forbidden subgraph problem is the following problem: given a graph G, find the maximal number of edges in an n-vertex graph which does not have a subgraph isomorphic to G. In this context, G is called a forbidden subgraph.1
It is also called the Turán-type problem and the corresponding number is called the Turán number for graph G. It is called so in memory of Pál Turán, who determined this number for all n and all complete graphs

 
 .2
An equivalent problem is how many edges in an n-vertex graph guarantee that it has a subgraph isomorphic to G?3
The problem may be generalized for a set of forbidden subgraphs S: find the maximal number of edges in an n-vertex graph which does not have a subgraph isomorphic to any graph form S.4
