   Distribution (number theory)      Distribution (number theory)   In algebra and number theory , a distribution is a function on a system of finite sets into an abelian group which is analogous to an integral: it is thus the algebraic analogue of a distribution in the sense of generalised function .  The original examples of distributions occur, unnamed, as functions φ on Q / Z satisfying 1         ∑   r  =  0    N  -  1     ϕ   (   x  +   r  N    )     =   ϕ   (   N  x   )     .        superscript   subscript     r  0      N  1      ϕ    x    r  N        ϕ    N  x      \sum_{r=0}^{N-1}\phi\left(x+\frac{r}{N}\right)=\phi(Nx)\ .     We shall call these ordinary distributions . 2 They also occur in p -adic integration theory in Iwasawa theory . 3  Let ... → X n +1 → X n → ... be a projective system of finite sets with surjections, indexed by the natural numbers, and let X be their projective limit . We give each X n the discrete topology , so that X is compact . Let φ = (φ n ) be a family of functions on X n taking values in an abelian group V and compatible with the projective system:       w   (  m  ,  n  )     ∑   y  ↦  x     ϕ   (  y  )      =   ϕ   (  x  )          w   m  n     subscript    maps-to  y  x      ϕ  y       ϕ  x     w(m,n)\sum_{y\mapsto x}\phi(y)=\phi(x)     for some weight function  w . The family φ is then a distribution on the projective system X .  A function f on X is "locally constant", or a "step function" if it factors through some X n . We can define an integral of a step function against φ as        ∫    f   d  ϕ    =    ∑   x  ∈   X  n      f   (  x  )    ϕ  n    (  x  )      .          f  d  ϕ      subscript     x   subscript  X  n       f  x   subscript  ϕ  n   x      \int f\,d\phi=\sum_{x\in X_{n}}f(x)\phi_{n}(x)\ .     The definition extends to more general projective systems, such as those indexed by the positive integers ordered by divisibility. As an important special case consider the projective system Z / n Z indexed by positive integers ordered by divisibility. We identify this with the system (1/ n ) Z / Z with limit Q / Z .  For x in R we let ⟨ x ⟩ denote the fractional part of x normalised to 0 ≤ ⟨ x ⟩ \zeta(s,a) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty (n+a)^{-s}  gives a distribution relation         ∑   p  =  0    q  -  1     ζ   (  s  ,   a  +   p  /  q    )     =     q  s    ζ   (  s  ,   q  a   )     .        superscript   subscript     p  0      q  1      ζ   s    a    p  q          superscript  q  s   ζ   s    q  a       \sum_{p=0}^{q-1}\zeta(s,a+p/q)=q^{s}\,\zeta(s,qa)\ .     Hence for given s , the map    t  ↦   ζ   (  s  ,   {  t  }   )       maps-to  t    ζ   s   t       t\mapsto\zeta(s,\{t\})   is a distribution on Q / Z .  Bernoulli distribution  Recall that the Bernoulli polynomials  B n are defined by         B  n    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   n     (     n       n  -  k      )    b  k     x   n  -  k        ,         subscript  B  n   x     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      binomial  n    n  k     subscript  b  k    superscript  x    n  k        B_{n}(x)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose n-k}b_{k}x^{n-k}\ ,     for n ≥ 0, where b k are the Bernoulli numbers , with generating function         t   e   x  t       e  t   -  1    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     B  n    (  x  )      t  n    n  !        .          t   superscript  e    x  t        superscript  e  t   1      superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  B  n   x     superscript  t  n     n        \frac{te^{xt}}{e^{t}-1}=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}B_{n}(x)\frac{t^{n}}{n!}\ .     They satisfy the distribution relation         B  k    (  x  )    =    n   k  -  1      ∑   a  =  0    n  -  1      b  k    (    x  +  a   n   )       .         subscript  B  k   x      superscript  n    k  1      superscript   subscript     a  0      n  1       subscript  b  k       x  a   n        B_{k}(x)=n^{k-1}\sum_{a=0}^{n-1}b_{k}\left({\frac{x+a}{n}}\right)\ .     Thus the map       ϕ  n   :      1  n   ℤ   /  ℤ   →  ℚ      normal-:   subscript  ϕ  n    normal-→        1  n   ℤ   ℤ   ℚ     \phi_{n}:\frac{1}{n}\mathbb{Z}/\mathbb{Z}\rightarrow\mathbb{Q}     defined by       ϕ  n   :   x  ↦    n   k  -  1     B  k    (   ⟨  x  ⟩   )        normal-:   subscript  ϕ  n    maps-to  x     superscript  n    k  1     subscript  B  k    delimited-⟨⟩  x       \phi_{n}:x\mapsto n^{k-1}B_{k}(\langle x\rangle)     is a distribution. 4  Cyclotomic units  The cyclotomic units satisfy distribution relations . Let a be an element of Q / Z prime to p and let g a denote exp(2πi a )−1. Then for a ≠ 0 we have 5         ∏    p  b   =  a     g  b    =    g  a     .        subscript  product      p  b   a     subscript  g  b     subscript  g  a     \prod_{pb=a}g_{b}=g_{a}\ .     Universal distribution  We consider the distributions on Z with values in some abelian group V and seek the "universal" or most general distribution possible.  Stickelberger distributions  Let h be an ordinary distribution on Q / Z taking values in a field F . Let G ( N ) denote the multiplicative group of Z / N Z , and for any function f on G ( N ) we extend f to a function on Z / N Z by taking f to be zero off G ( N ). Define an element of the group algebra F [ G ( N )] by         g  N    (  r  )    =    1   |   G   (  N  )    |      ∑   a  ∈   G   (  N  )       h   (   ⟨    r  a   N   ⟩   )     σ  a   -  1         .         subscript  g  N   r       1      G  N       subscript     a    G  N       h   delimited-⟨⟩      r  a   N     superscript   subscript  σ  a     1         g_{N}(r)=\frac{1}{|G(N)|}\sum_{a\in G(N)}h\left({\left\langle{\frac{ra}{N}}%
 \right\rangle}\right)\sigma_{a}^{-1}\ .     The group algebras form a projective system with limit X . Then the functions g N form a distribution on Q / Z with values in X , the Stickelberger distribution associated with h .  p-adic measures  Consider the special case when the value group V of a distribution φ on X takes values in a local field  K , finite over Q p , or more generally, in a finite-dimensional p -adic Banach space W over K , with valuation |·|. We call φ a measure if |φ| is bounded on compact open subsets of X . 6 Let D be the ring of integers of K and L a lattice in W , that is, a free D -submodule of W with K ⊗ L = W . Up to scaling a measure may be taken to have values in L .  Hecke operators and measures  Let D be a fixed integer prime to p and consider Z D , the limit of the system Z / p n D . Consider any eigenfunction of the Hecke operator  T p with eigenvalue λ p prime to p . We describe a procedure for deriving a measure of Z D .  Fix an integer N prime to p and to D . Let F be the D -module of all functions on rational numbers with denominator coprime to N . For any prime l not dividing N we define the Hecke operator  T l by         (    T  l   f   )    (   a  b   )    =     f   (    l  a   b   )    +    ∑   k  =  0    l  -  1     f   (    a  +   k  b     l  b    )      -    ∑   k  =  0    l  -  1     f   (   k  l   )       .           subscript  T  l   f     a  b          f      l  a   b      superscript   subscript     k  0      l  1      f      a    k  b      l  b         superscript   subscript     k  0      l  1      f    k  l        (T_{l}f)\left(\frac{a}{b}\right)=f\left(\frac{la}{b}\right)+\sum_{k=0}^{l-1}f%
 \left({\frac{a+kb}{lb}}\right)-\sum_{k=0}^{l-1}f\left(\frac{k}{l}\right)\ .     Let f be an eigenfunction for T p with eigenvalue λ p in D . The quadratic equation X 2 − λ p X + p = 0 has roots π 1 , π 2 with π 1 a unit and π 2 divisible by p . Define a sequence a 0 = 2, a 1 = π 1 +π 2 = λ p and        a   k  +  2    =     λ  p    a   k  +  1     -   p    a  k       ,       subscript  a    k  2         subscript  λ  p    subscript  a    k  1       p   subscript  a  k       a_{k+2}=\lambda_{p}a_{k+1}-pa_{k}\ ,     so that        a  k   =    π  1  k   +    π  2  k      .       subscript  a  k      superscript   subscript  π  1   k    superscript   subscript  π  2   k      a_{k}=\pi_{1}^{k}+\pi_{2}^{k}\ .
