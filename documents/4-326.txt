   Skolem–Noether theorem      Skolem–Noether theorem   In ring theory , a branch of mathematics, the Skolem–Noether theorem characterizes the automorphisms of simple rings . It is a fundamental result in the theory of central simple algebras .  The theorem was first published by Thoralf Skolem in 1927 in his paper Zur Theorie der assoziativen Zahlensysteme ( German : On the theory of associative number systems ) and later rediscovered by Emmy Noether .  Statement  In a general formulation, let A and B be simple rings, and let k be the centre of B . Notice that k is a field since given x nonzero in k , the simplicity of B implies that the nonzero two-sided ideal Bx is the whole of B , and hence that x is a unit . Suppose further that the dimension of B over k is finite, i.e. that B is a central simple algebra . Then given k -algebra homomorphisms   f , g : A → B    there exists a unit b in B such that for all a in A 1 2   g ( a ) = b · f ( a ) · b −1 .   In particular, every automorphism of a central simple k -algebra is an inner automorphism . 3 4  Proof  First suppose    B  =    M  n    (  k  )    =    End  k    (   k  n   )          B    subscript  normal-M  n   k          subscript  End  k    superscript  k  n       B=\operatorname{M}_{n}(k)=\operatorname{End}_{k}(k^{n})   . Then f and g define the actions of A on    k  n     superscript  k  n    k^{n}   ; let     V  f   ,   V  g       subscript  V  f    subscript  V  g     V_{f},V_{g}   denote the A -modules thus obtained. Any two simple A -modules are isomorphic and     V  f   ,   V  g       subscript  V  f    subscript  V  g     V_{f},V_{g}   are finite direct sums of simple A -modules. Since they have the same dimension, it follows that there is an isomorphism of A -modules    b  :    V  g   →   V  f       normal-:  b   normal-→   subscript  V  g    subscript  V  f      b:V_{g}\to V_{f}   . But such b must be an element of      M  n    (  k  )    =  B        subscript  normal-M  n   k   B    \operatorname{M}_{n}(k)=B   . For the general case, note that    B  ⊗   B  op      tensor-product  B   superscript  B  op     B\otimes B^{\text{op}}   is a matrix algebra and thus by the first part this algebra has an element b such that        (   f  ⊗  1   )    (   a  ⊗  z   )    =   b   (   g  ⊗  1   )    (   a  ⊗  z   )    b   -  1            tensor-product  f  1    tensor-product  a  z      b   tensor-product  g  1    tensor-product  a  z    superscript  b    1       (f\otimes 1)(a\otimes z)=b(g\otimes 1)(a\otimes z)b^{-1}   for all    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   and    z  ∈   B  op       z   superscript  B  op     z\in B^{\text{op}}   . Taking    a  =  1      a  1    a=1   , we find       1  ⊗  z   =   b   (   1  ⊗  z   )    b   -  1          tensor-product  1  z     b   tensor-product  1  z    superscript  b    1       1\otimes z=b(1\otimes z)b^{-1}   for all z . That is to say, b is in      Z   B  ⊗   B  op      (   k  ⊗   B  op    )    =   B  ⊗  k          subscript  Z   tensor-product  B   superscript  B  op      tensor-product  k   superscript  B  op      tensor-product  B  k     Z_{B\otimes B^{\text{op}}}(k\otimes B^{\text{op}})=B\otimes k   and so we can write    b  =    b  ′   ⊗  1       b   tensor-product   superscript  b  normal-′   1     b=b^{\prime}\otimes 1   . Taking    z  =  1      z  1    z=1   this time we find       f   (  a  )    =    b  ′   g   (  a  )    b   ′   -  1            f  a      superscript  b  normal-′   g  a   superscript  b   normal-′    1        f(a)=b^{\prime}g(a){b^{\prime-1}}   , which is what was sought.
