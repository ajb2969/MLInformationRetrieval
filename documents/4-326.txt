Skolem–Noether theorem

In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, the Skolem–Noether theorem characterizes the automorphisms of simple rings. It is a fundamental result in the theory of central simple algebras.
The theorem was first published by Thoralf Skolem in 1927 in his paper Zur Theorie der assoziativen Zahlensysteme (German: On the theory of associative number systems) and later rediscovered by Emmy Noether.
Statement
In a general formulation, let A and B be simple rings, and let k be the centre of B. Notice that k is a field since given x nonzero in k, the simplicity of B implies that the nonzero two-sided ideal Bx is the whole of B, and hence that x is a unit. Suppose further that the dimension of B over k is finite, i.e. that B is a central simple algebra. Then given k-algebra homomorphisms

f, g : A → B


there exists a unit b in B such that for all a in A12

g(a) = b · f(a) · b−1.
 

In particular, every automorphism of a central simple k-algebra is an inner automorphism.34
Proof
First suppose 
 
 
 
 . Then f and g define the actions of A on 
 
 
 
 ; let 
 
 
 
  denote the A-modules thus obtained. Any two simple A-modules are isomorphic and 
 
 
 
  are finite direct sums of simple A-modules. Since they have the same dimension, it follows that there is an isomorphism of A-modules 
 
 
 
 . But such b must be an element of 
 
 
 
 . For the general case, note that 
 
 
 
  is a matrix algebra and thus by the first part this algebra has an element b such that


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Taking 
 
 
 
 , we find


 
  for all z. That is to say, b is in 
 
 
 
  and so we can write 
 
 
 
 . Taking 
 
 
 
  this time we find


 
 , which is what was sought.
