   Class function (algebra)      Class function (algebra)   In mathematics , especially in the fields of group theory and representation theory of groups , a class function is a function on a group  G that is constant on the conjugacy classes of G . In other words, it is invariant under the conjugation map on G . Such functions play a basic role in representation theory .  Characters  The character of a linear representation of G over a field  K is always a class function with values in K . The class functions form the center of the group ring  K [ G ]. Here a class function f is identified with the element     ∑   g  ∈  G     f   (  g  )   g       subscript     g  G      f  g  g     \sum_{g\in G}f(g)g   .  Inner products  The set of class functions of a group G with values in a field K form a K - vector space . If G is finite and the characteristic of the field does not divide the order of G , then there is an inner product defined on this space defined by     ⟨  ϕ  ,  ψ  ⟩   =    1   |  G  |      ∑   g  ∈  G     ϕ   (  g  )   ψ   (   g   -  1    )           ϕ  ψ       1    G      subscript     g  G      ϕ  g  ψ   superscript  g    1         \langle\phi,\psi\rangle=\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}\phi(g)\psi(g^{-1})   where | G | denotes the order of G . The set of irreducible characters of G forms an orthogonal basis , and if K is a splitting field for G , for instance if K is algebraically closed , then the irreducible characters form an orthonormal basis .  In the case of a compact group and K = C the field of complex numbers , the notion of Haar measure allows one to replace the finite sum above with an integral      ⟨  ϕ  ,  ψ  ⟩   =    ∫  G    ϕ   (  t  )   ψ   (   t   -  1    )   d  t     .       ϕ  ψ     subscript   G     ϕ  t  ψ   superscript  t    1    d  t      \langle\phi,\psi\rangle=\int_{G}\phi(t)\psi(t^{-1})\,dt.     When K is the real numbers or the complex numbers, the inner product is a non-degenerate  Hermitian  bilinear form .
