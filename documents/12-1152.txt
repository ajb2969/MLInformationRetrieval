Sanford-Wang parameterisation

The Sanford-Wang parameterisation is an empirical formula used to model the production of pions in nuclear interaction of the form p+A â†’ 
 
 
 
 +X where a beam of high-energy protons hit a material.
Its formula for the double-differential cross section with respect to momentum (p) and solid angle (
 
 
 
 ) is as follows.




Where p and 
 
 
 
  are the momentum of the outgoing pion and its angle from the direction of the incident proton. The numbers 
 
 
 
  are the Sanford-Wang parameters and are typically varied to give a good fit with experimental data.
