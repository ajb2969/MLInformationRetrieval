Eisenstein reciprocity

In algebraic number theory Eisenstein's reciprocity law is a reciprocity law that extends the law of quadratic reciprocity and the cubic reciprocity law to residues of higher powers. It is one of the earliest and simplest of the higher reciprocity laws, and is a consequence of several later and stronger reciprocity laws such as the Artin reciprocity law. It was introduced by , though Jacobi had previously announced (without proof) a similar result for the special cases of 5th, 8th and 12th powers in 1839.1
Background and notation
Let  
 
 
 
  be an integer, and let   
 
 
 
   be the ring of integers of the m-th cyclotomic field   
 
 
 
   where  
 
 
 
   is a primitive m-th root of unity.
The numbers 
 
 
 
  are units in 
 
 
 
  (There are other units as well.)
Primary numbers
A number 
 
 
 
  is called primary23 if it is not a unit, is relatively prime to 
 
 
 
 , and is congruent to a rational (i.e. in 
 
 
 
 ) integer 
 
 

The following lemma45 shows that primary numbers in 
 
 
 
  are analogous to positive integers in 
 
 

Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and that both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively prime to 
 
 
 
  Then

There is an integer 
 
 
 
  making 
 
 
 
  primary. This integer is unique 
 
 

if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are primary then 
 
 
 
  is primary, provided that 
 
 
 
  is coprime with 
 
 
 
 .
if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are primary then 
 
 
 
  is primary.>


 
  is primary.


The significance of   
 
 
 
   which appears in the definition is most easily seen when   
 
 
 
    is a prime.  In that case   
 
 
 
    Furthermore, the prime ideal   
 
 
 
    of   
 
 
 
    is totally ramified in  
 
 



 
    and the ideal   
 
 
 
    is prime of degree 1.67

m-th power residue symbol
For 
 
 
 
  the m-th power residue symbol for 
 
 
 
  is either zero or an m-th root of unity:


 
  It is the m-th power version of the classical (quadratic, m = 2) Jacobi symbol (assuming 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are relatively prime):

If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 



If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is not an m-th power 
 
 



If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  may or may not be an m-th power 
 
 


Statement of the theorem

Eisenstein reciprocity
Let   
 
 
 
  be primary (and therefore relatively prime to   
 
 
 
 ), and assume that  
 
 
 
   is also relatively prime to  
 
 
 
   Then

Proof
The theorem is a consequence of the Stickelberger relation.1213  gives a historical discussion of some early reciprocity laws, including a proof of Eisenstein's law using Gauss and Jacobi sums that is based on Eisenstein's original proof.
Generalization
In 1922 Takagi proved that if 
 
 
 
   is an arbitrary algebraic number field containing the 
 
 
 
 -th roots of unity for a prime 
 
 
 
 , then Eisenstein's law for 
 
 
 
 -th powers holds in 
 
 
14
Applications
First case of Fermat's last theorem
Assume that 
 
 
 
  is an odd prime, that 
 
 
 
    for pairwise relatively prime integers (i.e. in 
 
 
 
  )   
 
 
 
  and that 
 
 

This is the first case of Fermat's last theorem. (The second case is when 
 
 
 
 )   Eisenstein reciprocity can be used to prove the following theorems
(Wieferich 1909)1516 Under the above assumptions,   
 
 


The only primes below 6.7×1015 that satisfy this are 1093 and 3511. See Wieferich primes for details and current records.
 

(Mirimanoff 1911)17 Under the above assumptions   
 
 


Analogous results are true for all primes ≤ 113, but the proof does not use Eisenstein's law. See Wieferich prime#Connection with Fermat's last theorem.
 

(Furtwängler 1912)1819 Under the above assumptions, for every prime   
 
 

(Furtwängler 1912)20 Under the above assumptions, for every prime   
 
 

(Vandiver)21 Under the above assumptions, if in addition   
 
 
 
    then   
 
 
 
    and   
 
 

Powers mod most primes
Eisenstein's law can be used to prove the following theorem (Trost, Ankeny, Rogers).22   Suppose   
 
 
 
    and that   
 
 
 
 
    where   
 
 
 
    is an odd prime. If   
 
 
 
    is solvable for all but finitely many primes   
 
 
 
    then
