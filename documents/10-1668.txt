   Lysolecithin acylmutase      Lysolecithin acylmutase   In enzymology , a lysolecithin acylmutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2-lysolecithin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-lysolecithin   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 2-lysolecithin , and one product , 3-lysolecithin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular transferases transferring acyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is lysolecithin 2,3-acylmutase . This enzyme is also called lysolecithin migratase .  References     "  Category:EC 5.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
