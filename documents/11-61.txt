   (carboxyethyl)arginine beta-lactam-synthase      (carboxyethyl)arginine beta-lactam-synthase   In enzymology , a (carboxyethyl)arginine beta-lactam-synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + L-N 2 -(2-carboxyethyl)arginine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + deoxyamidinoproclavaminate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and deoxyamidinoproclavaminate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically the cyclo-ligases, which form carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-N2-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine cyclo-ligase (AMP-forming) . This enzyme is also called L-2-N-(2-carboxyethyl)arginine cyclo-ligase (AMP-forming) . This enzyme participates in clavulanic acid biosynthesis .  References       "  Category:EC 6.3.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
