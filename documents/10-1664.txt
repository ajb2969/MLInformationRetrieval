Linoleate isomerase




Linoleate isomerase

In enzymology, a linoleate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

9-cis,12-cis-octadecadienoate 
 
 
 
  9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 9-cis,12-cis-octadecadienoate, and one product, 9-cis,11-trans-octadecadienoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically cis-trans isomerases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is linoleate Delta12-cis-Delta11-trans-isomerase. This enzyme is also called linoleic acid isomerase. This enzyme participates in linoleic acid metabolism.
