Sulfur carrier protein ThiS adenylyltransferase

Sulfur carrier protein ThiS adenylyltransferase (, thiF (gene)) is an enzyme with system name ATP:(ThiS) adenylyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + [ThiS] 
 
 
diphosphate + adenylyl-[ThiS]
 

This enzyme binds Zn2+. The enzyme catalyses the adenylation of ThiS, a sulfur carrier protein involved in the biosynthesis of thiamine.
