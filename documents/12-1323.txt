Parametric family

In mathematics and its applications, a parametric family or a parameterized family is a family of objects (a set of related objects) whose definitions depend on a set of parameters.
Common examples are parametrized (families of) functions, probability distributions, curves, shapes, etc.
In probability and its applications
For example, the probability density function 
 
 
 
  of a random variable X may depend on a parameter 
 
 
 
 . In that case, the function may be denoted 
 
 
 
  to indicate the dependence on the parameter 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is not a formal argument of the function as it is considered to be fixed. However, each different value of the parameter gives a different probability density function. Then the parametric family of densities is the set of functions 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  denotes the set of all possible values that the parameter 
 
 
 
  can take. In particular the normal distribution is a family of similarly shaped distributions parametrized by their mean and their variance.
In decision theory, two-moment decision models can be applied when the decision-maker is faced with random variables drawn from a location-scale family of probability distributions.
In algebra and its applications
In economics, the Cobb-Douglas production function is a family of production functions parametrized by the elasticities of output with respect to the various factors of production.
In algebra, the quadratic equation, for example, is actually a family of equations parametrized by the coefficients of the variable and of its square and by the constant term.
