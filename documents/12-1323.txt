   Parametric family      Parametric family   In mathematics and its applications, a parametric family or a parameterized family is a family of objects (a set of related objects) whose definitions depend on a set of parameters .  Common examples are parametrized (families of) functions , probability distributions , curves , shapes , etc.  In probability and its applications  For example, the probability density function    f  X     subscript  f  X    f_{X}   of a random variable X may depend on a parameter   θ   θ   \theta   . In that case, the function may be denoted     f  X    (  ⋅  ;  θ  )        subscript  f  X    normal-⋅  θ     f_{X}(\cdot\,;\theta)   to indicate the dependence on the parameter   θ   θ   \theta   .   θ   θ   \theta   is not a formal argument of the function as it is considered to be fixed. However, each different value of the parameter gives a different probability density function. Then the parametric family of densities is the set of functions    {    f  X    (  ⋅  ;  θ  )    ∣   θ  ∈  Θ   }     conditional-set     subscript  f  X    normal-⋅  θ      θ  normal-Θ     \{f_{X}(\cdot\,;\theta)\mid\theta\in\Theta\}   , where   Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   denotes the set of all possible values that the parameter   θ   θ   \theta   can take. In particular the normal distribution is a family of similarly shaped distributions parametrized by their mean and their variance .  In decision theory , two-moment decision models can be applied when the decision-maker is faced with random variables drawn from a location-scale family of probability distributions.  In algebra and its applications  In economics , the Cobb-Douglas production function is a family of production functions parametrized by the elasticities of output with respect to the various factors of production .  In algebra , the quadratic equation , for example, is actually a family of equations parametrized by the coefficients of the variable and of its square and by the constant term .
