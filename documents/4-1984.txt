   Elongated triangular gyrobicupola      Elongated triangular gyrobicupola   In geometry , the elongated triangular gyrobicupola is one of the Johnson solids ( J 36 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a "triangular gyrobicupola," or cuboctahedron , by inserting a hexagonal prism between its two halves, which are congruent triangular cupolae ( J 3 ). Rotating one of the cupolae through 60 degrees before the elongation yields the triangular orthobicupola ( J 35 ).  Formulae  The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    (     5   2    3   +    3   3    2    )    a  3    ≈   4.9551...   a  3          V          5    2    3       3    3    2     superscript  a  3           4.9551...   superscript  a  3       V=(\frac{5\sqrt{2}}{3}+\frac{3\sqrt{3}}{2})a^{3}\approx 4.9551...a^{3}       A  =   2   (   6  +   3    )    a  2    ≈   15.4641...   a  2          A    2    6    3     superscript  a  2           15.4641...   superscript  a  2       A=2(6+\sqrt{3})a^{2}\approx 15.4641...a^{2}     Related polyhedra and honeycombs  Elongated triangular gyrobicupola forms space-filling honeycombs with Tetrahedron and Square pyramid . 2   References  External links      "  Category:Johnson solids     Stephen Wolfram , " Elongated triangular gyrobicupola " from Wolfram Alpha .
