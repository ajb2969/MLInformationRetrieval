He called it the "transcendent angle," and it went by various names until 1862 when Arthur Cayley suggested it be given its current name as a tribute to Gudermann's work in the 1830s on the theory of special functions. 6 Gudermann had published articles in Crelle's Journal that were collected in Theorie der potenzial- oder yklisch-hyperbolischen Funtionen (1833), a book which expounded sinh and cosh to a wide audience (under the guises of    ℭ  𝔬  𝔰      ℭ  𝔬  𝔰    \mathfrak{Cos}   and    u  =    ∫  0  ϕ    sec    t   d  t     =    ln    tan   (      1  4    π   +     1  2    ϕ    )           u    superscript   subscript   0   ϕ       t  normal-d  t                    1  4   π       1  2   ϕ         u=\int_{0}^{\phi}\sec t\,\mathrm{d}t=\ln\,\tan\left(\tfrac{1}{4}\pi+\tfrac{1}{%
 2}\phi\right)   ).  The notation gd was introduced by Cayley 7 where he starts by calling gd. u the inverse of the integral of the secant function :       gd  u   =    i   -  1      ln    tan   (      1  4    π   +     1  2    u  i    )           gd  u      superscript  i    1              1  4   π       1  2   u  i         \operatorname{gd}\,u=i^{-1}\ln\,\tan\left(\tfrac{1}{4}\pi+\tfrac{1}{2}ui\right)     and then derives "the definition" of the transcendent:         1  2    π   -    gd   x           1  2   π     gd  x     \tfrac{1}{2}\pi-\mathrm{gd}\,x     observing immediately that it is a real function of u .  Applications   The angle of parallelism function in hyperbolic geometry is defined by   $$\tfrac{1}{2}\pi - \mathrm{gd}\,x$$   On a Mercator projection a line of constant latitude is parallel to the equator (on the projection) and is displaced by an amount proportional to the inverse Gudermannian of the latitude.    The Gudermannian (with a complex argument) may be used in the definition of the Transverse Mercator projection .     The Gudermannian appears in a non-periodic solution of the inverted pendulum .     The Gudermannian also appears in a moving mirror solution of the dynamical Casimir effect . 8   References  See also   Hyperbolic secant distribution  Mercator projection  Tangent half-angle formula  Tractrix  Trigonometric identity   "  Category:Trigonometry  Category:Elementary special functions  Category:Exponentials     ↩  CRC Handbook of Mathematical Sciences 5th ed. pp. 323–325 ↩  ↩    George F.
