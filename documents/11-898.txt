   Fatty-acid synthase      Fatty-acid synthase   In enzymology , a fatty-acid synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + n malonyl-CoA + 2n NADPH + 2n H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a long-chain fatty acid + (n + 1) CoA + n CO 2 + 2n NADP +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA , malonyl-CoA , NADPH , and H + , whereas its 4 products are long-chain fatty acid , CoA , CO 2 , and NADP + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:malonyl-CoA C-acyltransferase (decarboxylating, oxoacyl- and enoyl-reducing and thioester-hydrolysing) . This enzyme is also called yeast fatty acid synthase . This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis and insulin signaling pathway .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
