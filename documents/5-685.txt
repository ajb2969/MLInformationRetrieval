   Abnormal return      Abnormal return   In finance, an abnormal return is the difference between the actual return of a security and the expected return . Abnormal returns are sometimes triggered by "events." Events can include mergers , dividend announcements, company earning announcements, interest rate increases, lawsuits , etc. all of which can contribute to an abnormal return. Events in finance can typically be classified as information or occurrences that have not already been priced by the market .  Stock market  In stock market trading, abnormal returns are the differences between a single stock or portfolio's performance and the expected return over a set period of time. 1 Usually a broad index, such as the S&P; 500 or a national index like the Nikkei 225 , is used as a benchmark to determine the expected return. For example if a stock increased by 5% because of some news that affected the stock price, but the average market only increased by 3% and the stock has a beta of 1, then the abnormal return was 2% (5% - 3% = 2%). If the market average performs better (after adjusting for beta) than the individual stock, then the abnormal return will be negative.      Abnormal Return  =   Actual Return  -  Expected Return       Abnormal Return    Actual Return  Expected Return     \textrm{Abnormal\ Return}=\textrm{Actual\ Return}-\textrm{Expected\ Return}     Cumulative abnormal return  Cumulative abnormal return, or CAR, is the sum of all abnormal returns. 2 Cumulative Abnormal Returns are usually calculated over small windows, often only days. This is because evidence has shown that compounding daily abnormal returns can create bias in the results. 3  See also   Market value  Rate of return   References  "  Category:Equity securities  Category:Stock market     ↩  Trading-Glossary Cumulative abnormal return (CAR) Retrieved on July 18, 2007 ↩  Brown, Stephen and Jerold Warner, 1985, "Using daily stock returns: the case of event studies," Journal of Financial Economics 14, 3-31. ↩
