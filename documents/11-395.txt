Undecaprenyl-diphosphatase

In enzymology, an undecaprenyl-diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

undecaprenyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  undecaprenyl phosphate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are undecaprenyl diphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are undecaprenyl phosphate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is undecaprenyl-diphosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include C55-isoprenyl diphosphatase, C55-isoprenyl pyrophosphatase, and isoprenyl pyrophosphatase. This enzyme participates in peptidoglycan biosynthesis.
