   Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase      Phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase   In enzymology , a phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase . Other names in common use include PTEN, MMAC1 , and phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphohydrolase . This enzyme participates in 10 metabolic pathways : inositol phosphate metabolism , phosphatidylinositol signaling system , p53 signaling pathway , focal adhesion , tight junction , endometrial cancer , glioma , prostate cancer , melanoma , and small cell lung cancer . It employs one cofactor , magnesium .  References      "  Category:EC 3.1.3  Category:Magnesium enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
