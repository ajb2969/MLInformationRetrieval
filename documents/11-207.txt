   Glucarate dehydratase      Glucarate dehydratase   In enzymology , a glucarate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glucarate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-glucarate , and two products , 5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glucarate hydro-lyase (5-dehydro-4-deoxy-D-glucarate-forming) . Other names in common use include D-glucarate dehydratase , and D-glucarate hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in ascorbate and aldarate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
