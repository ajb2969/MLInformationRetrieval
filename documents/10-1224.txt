N-acylhexosamine oxidase

In enzymology, a N-acylhexosamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + O2

 
  N-acetyl-D-glucosaminate + H2O2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and O2, whereas its two products are N-acetyl-D-glucosaminate and H2O2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acyl-D-hexosamine:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include N-acyl-D-hexosamine oxidase, and N-acyl-beta-D-hexosamine:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase.
