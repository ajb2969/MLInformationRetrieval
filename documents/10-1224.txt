   N-acylhexosamine oxidase      N-acylhexosamine oxidase   In enzymology , a N-acylhexosamine oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-acetyl-D-glucosamine + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-acetyl-D-glucosaminate + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetyl-D-glucosamine and O 2 , whereas its two products are N-acetyl-D-glucosaminate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acyl-D-hexosamine:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include N-acyl-D-hexosamine oxidase , and N-acyl-beta-D-hexosamine:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
