N-formylmethionylaminoacyl-tRNA deformylase




N-formylmethionylaminoacyl-tRNA deformylase

In enzymology, a N-formylmethionylaminoacyl-tRNA deformylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-formyl-L-methionylaminoacyl-tRNA + H2O 
 
 
 
  formate + L-methionylaminoacyl-tRNA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-formyl-L-methionylaminoacyl-tRNA and H2O, whereas its two products are formate and L-methionylaminoacyl-tRNA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-formyl-L-methionylaminoacyl-tRNA amidohydrolase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
