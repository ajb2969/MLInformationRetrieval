Bockstein spectral sequence

In mathematics, the Bockstein spectral sequence is a spectral sequence relating the homology with mod p coefficients and the homology reduced mod p. It is named after Meyer Bockstein.
Definition
Let C be a chain complex of torsion-free abelian groups and p a prime number. Then we have the exact sequence:


 
 . Taking integral homology H, we get the exact couple of "doubly graded" abelian groups:


 
 . where the grading goes
 
 
 
  and the same for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .
This gives the first page of the spectral sequence: we take 
 
 
 
  with the differential 
 
 
 
 . The derived couple of the above exact couple then gives the second page and so forth. Explicitly, we have 
 
 
 
  that fits into the exact couple:


 
   where 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (the degrees of i, k are the same as before). Now, taking 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , we get:


 
 . This tells the kernel and cokernel of 
 
 
 
 . Expanding the exact couple into a long exact sequence, we get: for any r,


 
 . When 
 
 
 
 , this is the same thing as the universal coefficient theorem for homology.
Assume the abelian group 
 
 
 
  is finitely generated; in particular, only finitely many cyclic modules of the form 
 
 
 
  can appear as a direct summand of 
 
 
 
 . Letting 
 
 
 
  we thus see 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 .
