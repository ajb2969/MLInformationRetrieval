   Omega language      Omega language   An ω -language is a set of infinite-length sequences of symbols .  Formal definition  Let Σ be a set of symbols (not necessarily finite). Following the standard definition from formal language theory, Σ * is the set of all finite words over Σ. Every finite word has a length, which is, obviously, a natural number. Given a word w of length n , w can be viewed as a function from the set {0,1,..., n -1} → Σ, with the value at i giving the symbol at position i . The infinite words, or ω-words, can likewise be viewed as functions from   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   to Σ. The set of all infinite words over Σ is denoted Σ ω . The set of all finite and infinite words over Σ is sometimes written Σ ∞ .  Thus, an ω-language L over Σ is a subset of Σ ω .  Operations  Some common operations defined on ω-languages are:   Intersection and union . Given ω-languages L and M , both L ∪ M and L ∩ M are ω-languages.  Left catenation . Let L be an ω-language, and K be a language of finite words only. Then K can be catenated on the left only to L to yield the new ω-language KL .  Omega (infinite iteration) . As the notation hints, the operation (   ⋅   normal-⋅   \cdot   ) ω is the infinite version of the Kleene star operator on finite-length languages. Given a formal language L , L ω is the ω-language of all infinite sequences of words from L ; in the functional view, of all functions   ℕ   ℕ   \mathbb{N}   → L .  Prefixes . Let w be an ω-word. Then the formal language Pref( w ) contains every finite  prefix of w .  Limit . Given a finite-length language L , an ω-word w is in the limit of L if and only if Pref( w ) ∩ L is an infinite set. In other words, for an arbitrarily large natural number n , it is always possible to choose some word in L , whose length is greater than n , and which is a prefix of w . The limit operation on L can be written L δ or    L  →     normal-→  L    \vec{L}   .   Distance between ω-words  The set Σ ω can be made into a metric space by definition of the metric d:Σ ω × Σ ω → R as:   if  w and v share any finite prefix, then d( w , v )= inf {2 -| x | : x in Σ * , and x in both Pref( w ) and Pref( v ) }.  otherwise d( w , v )=1   where | x | is interpreted as "the length of x " (number of symbols in x ), and inf is the infimum over sets of real numbers . If w = v , they have no longest finite prefix, and d( w , v )=0; it can be shown that d satisfies all the other necessary properties of a metric .  Important subclasses  The most widely used subclass of the ω-languages is the set of ω-regular languages , which enjoy the useful property of being recognizable by Büchi automata ; thus the decision problem of ω-regular language membership is decidable and fairly straightforward to compute.
