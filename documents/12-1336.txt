Graph continuous function

In mathematics, and in particular the study of game theory, a function is graph continuous if it exhibits the following properties. The concept was originally defined by Partha Dasgupta and Eric Maskin in 1986 and is a version of continuity that finds application in the study of continuous games.
Notation and preliminaries
Consider a game with 
 
 
 
  agents with agent 
 
 
 
  having strategy 
 
 
 
 ; write 
 
 
 
  for an N-tuple of actions (i.e. 
 
 
 
 ) and 
 
 
 
  as the vector of all agents' actions apart from agent 
 
 
 
 .
Let 
 
 
 
  be the payoff function for agent 
 
 
 
 .
A game is defined as 
 
 
 
 . If a graph is continuous you should connect it if it's not then don't connect it.
Definition
Function 
 
 
 
  is graph continuous if for all 
 
 
 
  there exists a function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is continuous at 
 
 
 
 .
Dasgupta and Maskin named this property "graph continuity" because, if one plots a graph of a player's payoff as a function of his own strategy (keeping the other players' strategies fixed), then a graph-continuous payoff function will result in this graph changing continuously as one varies the strategies of the other players.
The property is interesting in view of the following theorem.
If, for 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is non-empty, convex, and compact; and if 
 
 
 
  is quasi-concave in 
 
 
 
 , upper semi-continuous in 
 
 
 
 , and graph continuous, then the game 
 
 
 
  possesses a pure strategy Nash equilibrium.
