4-acetamidobutyrate deacetylase

In enzymology, a 4-acetamidobutyrate deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-acetamidobutanoate + H2O 
 
 
 
  acetate + 4-aminobutanoate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-acetamidobutanoate and H2O, whereas its two products are acetate and 4-aminobutanoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-acetamidobutanoate amidohydrolase. This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups and lysine degradation.
