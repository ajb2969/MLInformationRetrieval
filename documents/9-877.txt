   Bidirectional map      Bidirectional map   In computer science , a bidirectional map , or hash bag , is an associative data structure in which the    (   k  e  y   ,   v  a  l  u  e   )       k  e  y     v  a  l  u  e     (key,value)   pairs form a one-to-one correspondence . Thus the binary relation is functional in each direction    v  a  l  u  e      v  a  l  u  e    value   can also act as a key to    k  e  y      k  e  y    key   . A pair    (  a  ,  b  )     a  b    (a,b)   thus provides a unique coupling between   a   a   a   and   b   b   b   so that   b   b   b   can be found when   a   a   a   is used as a key and   a   a   a   can be found when   b   b   b   is used as a key.
