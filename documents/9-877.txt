Bidirectional map

In computer science, a bidirectional map, or hash bag, is an associative data structure in which the 
 
 
 
  pairs form a one-to-one correspondence. Thus the binary relation is functional in each direction
 
 
 
  can also act as a key to 
 
 
 
 . A pair 
 
 
 
  thus provides a unique coupling between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  so that 
 
 
 
  can be found when 
 
 
 
  is used as a key and 
 
 
 
  can be found when 
 
 
 
  is used as a key.
