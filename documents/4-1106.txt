   Convergence of Fourier series      Convergence of Fourier series   In mathematics , the question of whether the Fourier series of a periodic function  converges to the given function is researched by a field known as classical harmonic analysis , a branch of pure mathematics . Convergence is not necessarily given in the general case, and there are criteria which need to be met in order for convergence to occur.  Determination of convergence requires the comprehension of pointwise convergence , uniform convergence , absolute convergence , L p spaces , summability methods and the Ces√†ro mean .  Preliminaries  Consider ∆í an integrable function on the interval [0,2œÄ]. For such an ∆í the Fourier coefficients      f  ^    (  n  )        normal-^  f   n    \widehat{f}(n)   are defined by the formula          f  ^    (  n  )    =    1   2  œÄ      ‚à´  0   2  œÄ     f   (  t  )     e   -   i  n  t      d  t      ,   n  ‚àà  ùêô    .     formulae-sequence       normal-^  f   n       1    2  œÄ      superscript   subscript   0     2  œÄ      f  t   superscript  e      i  n  t     d  t        n  ùêô     \widehat{f}(n)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{0}^{2\pi}f(t)e^{-int}\,dt,\quad n\in\mathbf%
 {Z}.     It is common to describe the connection between ∆í and its Fourier series by       f  ‚àº    ‚àë  n     f  ^    (  n  )    e   i  n  t       .     similar-to  f    subscript   n      normal-^  f   n   superscript  e    i  n  t        f\sim\sum_{n}\widehat{f}(n)e^{int}.     The notation ~ here means that the sum represents the function in some sense. In order to investigate this more carefully, the partial sums need to be defined:         S  N    (  f  ;  t  )    =    ‚àë   n  =   -  N    N     f  ^    (  n  )    e   i  n  t       .         subscript  S  N    f  t      superscript   subscript     n    N     N      normal-^  f   n   superscript  e    i  n  t        S_{N}(f;t)=\sum_{n=-N}^{N}\widehat{f}(n)e^{int}.     The question we will be interested in is: Do the functions     S  N    (  f  )        subscript  S  N   f    S_{N}(f)   (which are functions of the variable t we omitted in the notation) converge to ∆í and in which sense? Are there conditions on ∆í ensuring this or that type of convergence? This is the main problem discussed in this article.  Before continuing the Dirichlet kernel needs to be introduced. Taking the formula for     f  ^    (  n  )        normal-^  f   n    \widehat{f}(n)   , inserting it into the formula for    S  N     subscript  S  N    S_{N}   and doing some algebra will give that        S  N    (  f  )    =   f  *    D  N            subscript  S  N   f     f   subscript  D  N      S_{N}(f)=f*D_{N}\,     where ‚àó stands for the periodic convolution and    D  N     subscript  D  N    D_{N}   is the Dirichlet kernel which has an explicit formula,         D  n    (  t  )    =    sin   (    (   n  +   1  2    )   t   )     sin   (   t  /  2   )      .         subscript  D  n   t           n    1  2    t        t  2       D_{n}(t)=\frac{\sin((n+\frac{1}{2})t)}{\sin(t/2)}.     The Dirichlet kernel is not a positive kernel, and in fact, its norm diverges, namely       ‚à´    |    D  n    (  t  )    |   d  t    ‚Üí  ‚àû     normal-‚Üí           subscript  D  n   t    d  t       \int|D_{n}(t)|\,dt\to\infty     a fact that will play a crucial role in the discussion. The norm of D n in L 1 ( T ) coincides with the norm of the convolution operator with D n , acting on the space C ( T ) of periodic continuous functions, or with the norm of the linear functional ∆í ‚Üí ( S n ∆í )(0) on C ( T ). Hence, this family of linear functionals on C ( T ) is unbounded, when n ‚Üí¬†‚àû.  Magnitude of Fourier coefficients  In applications, it is often useful to know the size of the Fourier coefficient.  If   f   f   f   is an absolutely continuous function,       |    f  ^    (  n  )    |   ‚â§   K   |  n  |             normal-^  f   n      K    n      \left|\widehat{f}(n)\right|\leq{K\over|n|}   for   K   K   K   a constant that only depends on   f   f   f   .  If   f   f   f   is a bounded variation function,        |    f  ^    (  n  )    |   ‚â§    var   (  f  )     2  œÄ   |  n  |      .           normal-^  f   n        var  f     2  œÄ    n       \left|\widehat{f}(n)\right|\leq{{\rm var}(f)\over 2\pi|n|}.     If    f  ‚àà   C  p       f   superscript  C  p     f\in C^{p}           |    f  ^    (  n  )    |   ‚â§     ‚à•   f   (  p  )    ‚à•    L  1      |  n  |   p     .           normal-^  f   n       subscript   norm   superscript  f  p     subscript  L  1     superscript    n   p      \left|\widehat{f}(n)\right|\leq{\|f^{(p)}\|_{L_{1}}\over|n|^{p}}.     If    f  ‚àà   C  p       f   superscript  C  p     f\in C^{p}   and    f   (  p  )      superscript  f  p    f^{(p)}   has modulus of continuity     œâ  p     subscript  œâ  p    \omega_{p}   ,       |    f  ^    (  n  )    |   ‚â§    œâ   (    2  œÄ   /  n   )      |  n  |   p             normal-^  f   n        œâ      2  œÄ   n     superscript    n   p      \left|\widehat{f}(n)\right|\leq{\omega(2\pi/n)\over|n|^{p}}     and therefore, if   f   f   f   is in the Œ±- H√∂lder class        |    f  ^    (  n  )    |   ‚â§   K    |  n  |   Œ±     .           normal-^  f   n      K   superscript    n   Œ±      \left|\widehat{f}(n)\right|\leq{K\over|n|^{\alpha}}.     Pointwise convergence  There are many known sufficient conditions for the Fourier series of a function to converge at a given point x , for example if the function is differentiable at x . Even a jump discontinuity does not pose a problem: if the function has left and right derivatives at x , then the Fourier series will converge to the average of the left and right limits (but see Gibbs phenomenon ).  The Dirichlet‚ÄìDini Criterion states that: if ∆í is 2œÄ‚Äìperiodic, locally integrable and satisfies         ‚à´  0  œÄ     |      f   (    x  0   +  t   )    +   f   (    x  0   -  t   )     2   -  ‚Ñì   |     d  t   t     <  ‚àû   ,        superscript   subscript   0   œÄ               f     subscript  x  0   t      f     subscript  x  0   t     2   normal-‚Ñì        normal-d  t   t        \int_{0}^{\pi}\Bigl|\frac{f(x_{0}+t)+f(x_{0}-t)}{2}-\ell\Bigr|\,\frac{\mathrm{%
 d}t}{t}<\infty,     then (S n ∆í )( x 0 ) converges to ‚Ñì. This implies that for any function ∆í of any H√∂lder class  Œ± > 0, the Fourier series converges everywhere to ∆í ( x ).  It is also known that for any periodic function of bounded variation , the Fourier series converges everywhere. See also Dini test . In general, the most common criteria for pointwise convergence of a periodic function f are as follows:   If f satisfies a Holder condition, then its Fourier series converges uniformly.  If f is of bounded variation, then its Fourier series converges everywhere.  If f is continuous and its Fourier coefficients are absolutely summable, then the Fourier series converges uniformly.   There exist continuous functions whose Fourier series converges pointwise but not uniformly; see Antoni Zygmund, Trigonometric Series, vol. 1, Chapter 8, Theorem 1.13, p.¬†300.  However, the Fourier series of a continuous function need not converge pointwise. Perhaps the easiest proof uses the non-boundedness of Dirichlet's kernel in L 1 ( T ) and the Banach‚ÄìSteinhaus uniform boundedness principle . As typical for existence arguments invoking the Baire category theorem , this proof is nonconstructive. It shows that the family of continuous functions whose Fourier series converges at a given x is of first Baire category , in the Banach space of continuous functions on the circle. So in some sense pointwise convergence is atypical , and for most continuous functions the Fourier series does not converge at a given point. However Carleson's theorem shows that for a given continuous function the Fourier series converges almost everywhere.  Uniform convergence  Suppose    f  ‚àà   C  p       f   superscript  C  p     f\in C^{p}   , and    f   (  p  )      superscript  f  p    f^{(p)}   has modulus of continuity    œâ   œâ   \omega   (we assume here that   œâ   œâ   \omega   is also non decreasing), then the partial sum of the Fourier series converges to the function with speed 1       |    f   (  x  )    -    (    S  N   f   )    (  x  )     |   ‚â§   K    ln  N    N  p    œâ   (    2  œÄ   /  N   )              f  x        subscript  S  N   f   x       K      N    superscript  N  p    œâ      2  œÄ   N      |f(x)-(S_{N}f)(x)|\leq K{\ln N\over N^{p}}\omega(2\pi/N)   for a constant   K   K   K   that does not depend upon   f   f   f   , nor   p   p   p   , nor   N   N   N   .  This theorem, first proved by D Jackson, tells, for example, that if   f   f   f   satisfies the   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   - H√∂lder condition , then        |    f   (  x  )    -    (    S  N   f   )    (  x  )     |   ‚â§   K    ln  N    N  Œ±      .            f  x        subscript  S  N   f   x       K      N    superscript  N  Œ±       |f(x)-(S_{N}f)(x)|\leq K{\ln N\over N^{\alpha}}.     If   f   f   f   is    2  œÄ      2  œÄ    2\pi   periodic and absolutely continuous on    [  0  ,   2  œÄ   ]     0    2  œÄ     [0,2\pi]   , then the Fourier series of   f   f   f   converges uniformly, but not necessarily absolutely, to   f   f   f   . 2  Absolute convergence  A function ∆í has an absolutely converging Fourier series if         ‚à•  f  ‚à•   A   :=    ‚àë   n  =   -  ‚àû    ‚àû    |    f  ^    (  n  )    |    <  ‚àû   .       assign   subscript   norm  f   A     superscript   subscript     n               normal-^  f   n              \|f\|_{A}:=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}|\widehat{f}(n)|<\infty.     Obviously, if this condition holds then     (    S  N   f   )    (  t  )          subscript  S  N   f   t    (S_{N}f)(t)   converges absolutely for every t and on the other hand, it is enough that     (    S  N   f   )    (  t  )          subscript  S  N   f   t    (S_{N}f)(t)   converges absolutely for even one t , then this condition will hold. In other words, for absolute convergence there is no issue of where the sum converges absolutely¬†‚Äî if it converges absolutely at one point then it does so everywhere.  The family of all functions with absolutely converging Fourier series is a Banach algebra (the operation of multiplication in the algebra is a simple multiplication of functions). It is called the Wiener algebra , after Norbert Wiener , who proved that if ∆í has absolutely converging Fourier series and is never zero, then 1/ ∆í has absolutely converging Fourier series. The original proof of Wiener's theorem was difficult; a simplification using the theory of Banach algebras was given by Israel Gelfand . Finally, a short elementary proof was given by Donald J. Newman in 1975.  If   f   f   f   belongs to a Œ±-H√∂lder class for Œ±¬†> 1/2 then         ‚à•  f  ‚à•   A   ‚â§    c  Œ±     ‚à•  f  ‚à•    Lip  Œ±      ,     ‚à•  f  ‚à•   K   :=    ‚àë   n  =   -  ‚àû     +  ‚àû      |  n  |     |    f  ^    (  n  )    |   2     ‚â§    c  Œ±     ‚à•  f  ‚à•    Lip  Œ±   2        formulae-sequence     subscript   norm  f   A      subscript  c  Œ±    subscript   norm  f    subscript  Lip  Œ±         assign   subscript   norm  f   K     superscript   subscript     n                 n    superscript       normal-^  f   n    2             subscript  c  Œ±    subscript   superscript   norm  f   2    subscript  Lip  Œ±         \|f\|_{A}\leq c_{\alpha}\|f\|_{{\rm Lip}_{\alpha}},\qquad\|f\|_{K}:=\sum_{n=-%
 \infty}^{+\infty}|n||\widehat{f}(n)|^{2}\leq c_{\alpha}\|f\|^{2}_{{\rm Lip}_{%
 \alpha}}     for     ‚à•  f  ‚à•    Lip  Œ±      subscript   norm  f    subscript  Lip  Œ±     \|f\|_{{\rm Lip}_{\alpha}}   the constant in the H√∂lder condition ,    c  Œ±     subscript  c  Œ±    c_{\alpha}   a constant only dependent on   Œ±   Œ±   \alpha   ;     ‚à•  f  ‚à•   K     subscript   norm  f   K    \|f\|_{K}   is the norm of the Krein algebra. Notice that the 1/2 here is essential‚Äîthere are 1/2-H√∂lder functions which do not belong to the Wiener algebra. Besides, this theorem cannot improve the best known bound on the size of the Fourier coefficient of a Œ±-H√∂lder function‚Äîthat is only    O   (   1  /   n  Œ±    )       O    1   superscript  n  Œ±      O(1/n^{\alpha})   and then not summable.  If ∆í is of bounded variation  and belongs to a Œ±-H√∂lder class for some Œ±¬†>¬†0, it belongs to the Wiener algebra.  Norm convergence  The simplest case is that of L 2 , which is a direct transcription of general Hilbert space results. According to the Riesz‚ÄìFischer theorem , if ∆í is square-integrable then        lim   N  ‚Üí  ‚àû      ‚à´  0   2  œÄ        |    f   (  x  )    -    S  N    (  f  )     |   2    d  x     =  0        subscript    normal-‚Üí  N       superscript   subscript   0     2  œÄ       superscript        f  x      subscript  S  N   f     2   d  x     0    \lim_{N\rightarrow\infty}\int_{0}^{2\pi}\left|f(x)-S_{N}(f)\right|^{2}\,dx=0     i.e. ,     S  N   f       subscript  S  N   f    S_{N}f   converges to ∆í in the norm of L 2 . It is easy to see that the converse is also true: if the limit above is zero, ∆í must be in L 2 . So this is an if and only if condition.  If 2 in the exponents above is replaced with some p , the question becomes much harder. It turns out that the convergence still holds if 1¬†p]],     S  N    (  f  )        subscript  S  N   f    S_{N}(f)   converges to ∆í in the L p norm. The original proof uses properties of holomorphic functions and Hardy spaces , and another proof, due to Salomon Bochner relies upon the Riesz‚ÄìThorin interpolation theorem . For p =¬†1 and infinity, the result is not true. The construction of an example of divergence in L 1 was first done by Andrey Kolmogorov (see below). For infinity, the result is a corollary of the uniform boundedness principle .  If the partial summation operator S N is replaced by a suitable summability kernel (for example the Fej√©r sum obtained by convolution with the Fej√©r kernel ), basic functional analytic techniques can be applied to show that norm convergence holds for¬†1¬†‚â§ p 2 converges almost everywhere. This result is now known as Carleson's theorem . Later on Richard Hunt generalized this to L p for any p > 1. Despite a number of attempts at simplifying the proof, it is still one of the most difficult results in analysis.  Contrariwise, Andrey Kolmogorov , as a student at the age of 19, in his very first scientific work, constructed an example of a function in L 1 whose Fourier series diverges almost everywhere (later improved to divergence everywhere).  It might be interesting to note that Jean-Pierre Kahane and Yitzhak Katznelson proved that for any given set E of measure zero, there exists a continuous function ∆í such that the Fourier series of ∆í fails to converge on any point of E .  Summability  Does the sequence 0,1,0,1,0,1,... (the partial sums of Grandi's series ) converge to ¬Ω? This does not seem like a very unreasonable generalization of the notion of convergence. Hence we say that any sequence    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   is Ces√†ro summable to some a if         lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû      1  n     ‚àë   k  =  1   n    a  k      =  a   .        subscript    normal-‚Üí  n         1  n     superscript   subscript     k  1    n    subscript  a  k      a    \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=1}^{n}a_{k}=a.     It is not difficult to see that if a sequence converges to some a then it is also Ces√†ro summable to it.  To discuss summability of Fourier series, we must replace    S  N     subscript  S  N    S_{N}   with an appropriate notion. Hence we define          K  N    (  f  ;  t  )    =    1  N     ‚àë   n  =  0    N  -  1      S  n    (  f  ;  t  )       ,   N  ‚â•  1    ,     formulae-sequence       subscript  K  N    f  t        1  N     superscript   subscript     n  0      N  1       subscript  S  n    f  t         N  1     K_{N}(f;t)=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}S_{n}(f;t),\quad N\geq 1,     and ask: does     K  N    (  f  )        subscript  K  N   f    K_{N}(f)   converge to f ?    K  N     subscript  K  N    K_{N}   is no longer associated with Dirichlet's kernel, but with Fej√©r's kernel , namely        K  N    (  f  )    =   f  *    F  N            subscript  K  N   f     f   subscript  F  N      K_{N}(f)=f*F_{N}\,     where    F  N     subscript  F  N    F_{N}   is Fej√©r's kernel,        F  N   =    1  N     ‚àë   n  =  0    N  -  1     D  n      .       subscript  F  N       1  N     superscript   subscript     n  0      N  1     subscript  D  n       F_{N}=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{n=0}^{N-1}D_{n}.     The main difference is that Fej√©r's kernel is a positive kernel. Fej√©r's theorem states that the above sequence of partial sums converge uniformly to ∆í . This implies much better convergence properties   If ∆í is continuous at t then the Fourier series of ∆í is summable at t to ∆í ( t ). If ∆í is continuous, its Fourier series is uniformly summable (i.e.     K  N   f       subscript  K  N   f    K_{N}f   converges uniformly to ∆í ).  For any integrable ∆í ,     K  N   f       subscript  K  N   f    K_{N}f   converges to ∆í in the    L  1     superscript  L  1    L^{1}   norm.  There is no Gibbs phenomenon.   Results about summability can also imply results about regular convergence. For example, we learn that if ∆í is continuous at t , then the Fourier series of ∆í cannot converge to a value different from ∆í ( t ). It may either converge to ∆í ( t ) or diverge. This is because, if     S  N    (  f  ;  t  )        subscript  S  N    f  t     S_{N}(f;t)   converges to some value x , it is also summable to it, so from the first summability property above, x = ∆í ( t ).  Order of growth  The order of growth of Dirichlet's kernel is logarithmic, i.e.        ‚à´    |    D  N    (  t  )    |   d  t    =     4   œÄ  2     log  N    +   O   (  1  )      .               subscript  D  N   t    d  t          4   superscript  œÄ  2      N      O  1      \int|D_{N}(t)|\,dt=\frac{4}{\pi^{2}}\log N+O(1).     See Big O notation for the notation O (1). It should be noted that the actual value    4  /   œÄ  2       4   superscript  œÄ  2     4/\pi^{2}   is both difficult to calculate (see Zygmund 8.3) and of almost no use. The fact that for some constant c we have       ‚à´    |    D  N    (  t  )    |   d  t    >    c   log  N    +   O   (  1  )                  subscript  D  N   t    d  t        c    N      O  1      \int|D_{N}(t)|\,dt>c\log N+O(1)     is quite clear when one examines the graph of Dirichlet's kernel. The integral over the n -th peak is bigger than c / n and therefore the estimate for the harmonic sum gives the logarithmic estimate.  This estimate entails quantitative versions of some of the previous results. For any continuous function f and any t one has        lim   N  ‚Üí  ‚àû       S  N    (  f  ;  t  )     log  N     =  0.        subscript    normal-‚Üí  N          subscript  S  N    f  t      N     0.    \lim_{N\to\infty}\frac{S_{N}(f;t)}{\log N}=0.     However, for any order of growth œâ( n ) smaller than log, this no longer holds and it is possible to find a continuous function f such that for some t ,          lim  ¬Ø    N  ‚Üí  ‚àû       S  N    (  f  ;  t  )     œâ   (  N  )      =  ‚àû   .        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-‚Üí  N          subscript  S  N    f  t      œâ  N        \overline{\lim}_{N\to\infty}\frac{S_{N}(f;t)}{\omega(N)}=\infty.     The equivalent problem for divergence everywhere is open. Sergei Konyagin managed to construct an integrable function such that for every t one has          lim  ¬Ø    N  ‚Üí  ‚àû       S  N    (  f  ;  t  )      log  N      =  ‚àû   .        subscript  limit-supremum   normal-‚Üí  N          subscript  S  N    f  t        N         \overline{\lim}_{N\to\infty}\frac{S_{N}(f;t)}{\sqrt{\log N}}=\infty.     It is not known whether this example is best possible. The only bound from the other direction known is log n .  Multiple dimensions  Upon examining the equivalent problem in more than one dimension, it is necessary to specify the precise order of summation one uses. For example, in two dimensions, one may define        S  N    (  f  ;   t  1   ,   t  2   )    =    ‚àë     |   n  1   |   ‚â§  N   ,    |   n  2   |   ‚â§  N       f  ^    (   n  1   ,   n  2   )    e   i   (     n  1    t  1    +    n  2    t  2     )              subscript  S  N    f   subscript  t  1    subscript  t  2       subscript    formulae-sequence       subscript  n  1    N        subscript  n  2    N        normal-^  f     subscript  n  1    subscript  n  2     superscript  e    i       subscript  n  1    subscript  t  1       subscript  n  2    subscript  t  2           S_{N}(f;t_{1},t_{2})=\sum_{|n_{1}|\leq N,|n_{2}|\leq N}\widehat{f}(n_{1},n_{2}%
 )e^{i(n_{1}t_{1}+n_{2}t_{2})}     which are known as "square partial sums". Replacing the sum above with      ‚àë     n  1  2   +   n  2  2    ‚â§   N  2       subscript        superscript   subscript  n  1   2    superscript   subscript  n  2   2     superscript  N  2      \sum_{n_{1}^{2}+n_{2}^{2}\leq N^{2}}     lead to "circular partial sums". The difference between these two definitions is quite notable. For example, the norm of the corresponding Dirichlet kernel for square partial sums is of the order of     log  2   N      superscript   2   N    \log^{2}N   while for circular partial sums it is of the order of    N      N    \sqrt{N}   .  Many of the results true for one dimension are wrong or unknown in multiple dimensions. In particular, the equivalent of Carleson's theorem is still open for circular partial sums. Almost everywhere convergence of "square partial sums" (as well as more general polygonal partial sums) in multiple dimensions was established around 1970 by Charles Fefferman .
