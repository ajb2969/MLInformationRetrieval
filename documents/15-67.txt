   Glossary of algebraic geometry      Glossary of algebraic geometry   This is a glossary of algebraic geometry .  See also glossary of commutative algebra , glossary of classical algebraic geometry , and glossary of ring theory .  For simplicity, a reference to the base scheme is often omitted; i.e., a scheme will be a scheme over some fixed scheme S and a morphism an S -morphism.  !$@                 A  \mathbb{C} is not a variety since the coordinate ring is not an integral domain .}}    B    C           D       E  F    G    H    I  J  K  L  M    N  O    P  Q  R      S      =X\times_Y \mathrm{Spec} (k(\bar{y})) is a smooth n -dimensional variety over    k   (   y  ¯   )       k   normal-¯  y     k(\bar{y})   in the sense of classical algebraic geometry.   }}  T  U  V  W  Z  Notes  References             Kollár, János , "Book on Moduli of Surfaces" available at his website 1   See also   Glossary of arithmetic and Diophantine geometry  Glossary of classical algebraic geometry  Glossary of differential geometry and topology  Glossary of Riemannian and metric geometry    List of complex and algebraic surfaces  List of surfaces  List of curves   "  Algebraic geometry  Category:Algebraic geometry  Category:Scheme theory
