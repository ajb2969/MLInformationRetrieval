   Notation for differentiation      Notation for differentiation   In differential calculus , there is no single uniform notation for differentiation . Instead, several different notations for the derivative of a function or variable have been proposed by different mathematicians. The usefulness of each notation varies with the context, and it is sometimes advantageous to use more than one notation in a given context. The most common notations for differentiation are listed below.  Leibniz's notation     dy    dx      d 2 y    dx 2     The original notation employed by Gottfried Leibniz is used throughout mathematics. It is particularly common when the equation    y  =   f   (  x  )        y    f  x     y=f(x)   is regarded as a functional relationship between dependent and independent variables    y   y   y   and   x   x   x   . In this case the derivative can be written as:       d  y    d  x         d  y     d  x     \frac{dy}{dx}     The function whose value at   x   x   x   is the derivative of   f   f   f   at   x   x   x   is therefore written        d   (   f   (  x  )    )     d  x    or   d   d  x     (   f   (  x  )    )           d    f  x      d  x    or    d    d  x      f  x     \frac{d\bigl(f(x)\bigr)}{dx}\text{ or }\frac{d}{dx}\bigl(f(x)\bigr)     (although strictly speaking this denotes the variable value of the derivative function rather than the derivative function itself).  Higher derivatives are expressed as         d  n   y    d   x  n     ,     d  n    (   f   (  x  )    )     d   x  n     ,   or    d  n    d   x  n      (   f   (  x  )    )            superscript  d  n   y     d   superscript  x  n          superscript  d  n     f  x      d   superscript  x  n       or     superscript  d  n     d   superscript  x  n       f  x      \frac{d^{n}y}{dx^{n}},\quad\frac{d^{n}\bigl(f(x)\bigr)}{dx^{n}},\text{ or }%
 \frac{d^{n}}{dx^{n}}\bigl(f(x)\bigr)     for the n th derivative of y = f ( x ). Historically, this came from the fact that, for example, the third derivative is:        d   (    d   (    d  y    d  x    )     d  x    )     d  x    =     (   d   d  x    )   3    (   f   (  x  )    )            d      d      d  y     d  x       d  x       d  x       superscript    d    d  x    3     f  x      \frac{d\Bigl(\frac{d\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)}{dx}\Bigr)}{dx}=\left(\frac{d}{%
 dx}\right)^{3}\bigl(f(x)\bigr)     which we can loosely write (dropping the brackets in the denominator) as:         d  3     (   d  x   )   3     (   f   (  x  )    )    =     d  3    d   x  3      (   f   (  x  )    )             superscript  d  3    superscript    d  x   3      f  x         superscript  d  3     d   superscript  x  3       f  x      \frac{d^{3}}{\left(dx\right)^{3}}\bigl(f(x)\bigr)=\frac{d^{3}}{dx^{3}}\bigl(f(%
 x)\bigr)     as above.  With Leibniz's notation, the value of the derivative of y at a point x = a can be written in two different ways:             d  y    d  x          |    x  =  a    =     d  y    d  x     (  a  )     .       evaluated-at        d  y     d  x      absent  absent      x  a          d  y     d  x    a     \frac{dy}{dx}\left.{\!\!\frac{}{}}\right|_{x=a}=\frac{dy}{dx}(a).     Leibniz's notation allows one to specify the variable for differentiation (in the denominator). This is especially helpful when considering partial derivatives . It also makes the chain rule easy to remember and recognize:         d  y    d  x    =     d  y    d  u    ⋅    d  u    d  x      .          d  y     d  x     normal-⋅      d  y     d  u        d  u     d  x       \frac{dy}{dx}=\frac{dy}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}.     In the formulation of calculus in terms of limits, the du symbol has been assigned various meanings by various authors.  Some authors do not assign a meaning to du by itself, but only as part of the symbol du / dx .  Others define dx as an independent variable, and use d ( x + y ) = dx + dy and d ( x · y ) = dx · y + x · dy as formal axioms for differentiation. See differential algebra .  In non-standard analysis  du is defined as an infinitesimal .  It is also interpreted as the exterior derivative d u of a function u .  Lagrange's notation   ''f ʹ( x ) f ʺ( x'')   One of the most common modern notations for differentiation is due to Joseph Louis Lagrange and uses the prime mark : the first three derivatives of f are denoted       f  ′      superscript  f  normal-′    f^{\prime}\;   for the first derivative,       f  ′′      superscript  f  ′′    f^{\prime\prime}\;   for the second derivative ,       f  ′′′      superscript  f  ′′′    f^{\prime\prime\prime}\;   for the third derivative.  After this, some authors continue by employing Roman numerals such as f IV for the fourth derivative of f , while others put the ordinal of the derivative in parentheses , so that the fourth derivative of f would be denoted f (4) . The latter notation extends readily to any number of derivatives, so that the n th derivative of f is denoted f ( n ) .  Euler's notation   D x y  D 2 f   Euler 's notation uses a differential operator , denoted as D , which is prefixed to the function so that the derivatives of a function f are denoted by      D   f       D  f    Df\;   for the first derivative,       D  2    f        superscript  D  2   f    D^{2}f\;   for the second derivative, and       D  n    f        superscript  D  n   f    D^{n}f\;   for the n th derivative, for any positive integer n .  When taking the derivative of a dependent variable y = f ( x ) it is common to add the independent variable x as a subscript to the D notation, leading to the alternative notation       D  x    y        subscript  D  x   y    D_{x}y\;   for the first derivative,       D  x  2    y        subscript   superscript  D  2   x   y    D^{2}_{x}y\;   for the second derivative, and       D  x  n    y        subscript   superscript  D  n   x   y    D^{n}_{x}y\;   for the n th derivative, for any positive integer n .  If there is only one independent variable present, the subscript to the operator is usually dropped, however.  Euler's notation is useful for stating and solving linear differential equations , as it simplifies presentation of the differential equation, which can make seeing the essential elements of the problem easier.  Newton's notation   ẋ ẍ   Newton 's notation for differentiation (also called the dot notation for differentiation) requires placing a dot over the dependent variable and is often used for time derivatives such as velocity        y  ˙   =     d  y    d  t      ,       normal-˙  y       d  y     d  t      \dot{y}=\frac{dy}{dt}\,,     acceleration        y  ¨   =      d  2   y    d   t  2       ,       normal-¨  y        superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  t  2       \ddot{y}=\frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}\,,     and so on. It can also be used as a direct substitute for the prime in Lagrange's notation. Again this is common for functions f ( t ) of time. Newton referred to this as a fluxion . 1  Newton's notation is mainly used in mechanics , physics, and the theory of ordinary differential equations . It is usually only used for first and second derivatives, and then, only to denote derivatives with respect to time.  Dot notation is not very useful for higher-order derivatives, but in mechanics and other engineering fields, the use of higher than second-order derivatives is limited.  In physics , macroeconomics and other fields, Newton's notation is used mostly for time derivatives , as opposed to slope or position  derivatives .  Newton did not develop a standard mathematical notation for integration but used many different notations.  Partial derivatives   f x  f xy   When more specific types of differentiation are necessary, such as in multivariate calculus or tensor analysis , other notations are common.  For a function f(x) , we can express the derivative using subscripts of the independent variable:       f  x   =    d  f    d  x         subscript  f  x       d  f     d  x      f_{x}=\frac{df}{dx}           f   x  x    =     d  2   f    d   x  2      .       subscript  f    x  x         superscript  d  2   f     d   superscript  x  2       f_{xx}=\frac{d^{2}f}{dx^{2}}.     This is especially useful for taking partial derivatives of a function of several variables.     ∂f    ∂x     Partial derivatives will generally be distinguished from ordinary derivatives by replacing the differential operator d with a " ∂ " symbol. For example, we can indicate the partial derivative of f(x,y,z) with respect to x , but not to y or z in several ways:         ∂  f    ∂  x    =   f  x   =    ∂  x   f   =    ∂  x   f    ,            f     x     subscript  f  x          subscript   x   f          superscript   x   f      \frac{\partial f}{\partial x}=f_{x}=\partial_{x}f=\partial^{x}f,     where the final two notations are equivalent in flat Euclidean Space but are different in other manifolds .  Other notations can be found in various subfields of mathematics, physics, and engineering, see for example the Maxwell relations of thermodynamics . The symbol     (    ∂  T    ∂  V    )   S     subscript      T     V    S    \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial V}\right)_{S}   is the derivative of the temperature T with respect to the volume V while keeping constant the entropy S , while     (    ∂  T    ∂  V    )   P     subscript      T     V    P    \left(\frac{\partial T}{\partial V}\right)_{P}   is the derivative of the temperature with respect to the volume while keeping constant the pressure P .  Notation in vector calculus  Vector calculus concerns differentiation and integration of vector or scalar fields particularly in a three-dimensional Euclidean space , and uses specific notations of differentiation. In a Cartesian coordinate o- xyz , assuming a vector field  A is    𝐀  =   (   𝐀  x   ,   𝐀  y   ,   𝐀  z   )       𝐀    subscript  𝐀  x    subscript  𝐀  y    subscript  𝐀  z      \mathbf{A}=(\mathbf{A}_{x},\mathbf{A}_{y},\mathbf{A}_{z})   , and a scalar field    φ   φ   \varphi   is    φ  =   f   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )        φ    f   x  y  z      \varphi=f(x,y,z)\,   .  First, a differential operator, or a Hamilton operator  ∇ which is called del is symbolically defined in the form of a vector,       ∇  =   (   ∂   ∂  x    ,   ∂   ∂  y    ,   ∂   ∂  z    )    ,      normal-∇        x         y         z       \nabla=\left(\frac{\partial}{\partial x},\frac{\partial}{\partial y},\frac{%
 \partial}{\partial z}\right),     where the terminology symbolically reflects that the operator ∇ will also be treated as an ordinary vector.   ∇ φ    Gradient : The gradient     grad    φ       grad  φ    \mathrm{grad\,}\varphi\,   of the scalar field   φ   φ   \varphi   is a vector, which is symbolically expressed by the multiplication of ∇ and scalar field    φ   φ   \varphi    ,          \begin{align} \operatorname{grad} \varphi &= \left( \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial \varphi}{\partial z} \right) \\ &= \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right) \varphi \\ &= \nabla \varphi \end{align}   ∇∙ A    Divergence : The divergence     div    𝐀       div  𝐀    \mathrm{div}\,\mathbf{A}\,   of the vector field A is a scalar, which is symbolically expressed by the dot product of ∇ and the vector A ,          \begin{align} \operatorname{div} \mathbf{A} &= {\partial A_x \over \partial x} + {\partial A_y \over \partial y} + {\partial A_z \over \partial z} \\ &= \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial x}, \frac{\partial}{\partial y}, \frac{\partial}{\partial z} \right) \cdot \mathbf{A} \\ &= \nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} \end{align}   ∇ 2 φ    Laplacian : The Laplacian     div  grad   φ      div  grad   φ    \operatorname{div}\operatorname{grad}\varphi   of the scalar field   φ   φ   \varphi   is a scalar, which is symbolically expressed by the scalar multiplication of ∇ 2 and the scalar field φ ,          \begin{align} \operatorname{div} \operatorname{grad} \varphi &= \nabla \cdot (\nabla \varphi) \\ &= (\nabla \cdot \nabla) \varphi \\ &= \nabla^2 \varphi \\ &= \Delta \varphi \\ \end{align}    where,    Δ  =   ∇  2       normal-Δ   superscript  normal-∇  2     \Delta=\nabla^{2}   is called a Laplacian operator .      ∇× A    Rotation : The rotation     curl    𝐀       curl  𝐀    \mathrm{curl}\,\mathbf{A}\,   , or     rot    𝐀       rot  𝐀    \mathrm{rot}\,\mathbf{A}\,   , of the vector field A is a vector, which is symbolically expressed by the cross product of ∇ and the vector A ,          \begin{align} \operatorname{curl} \mathbf{A} &= \left(  {\partial A_z \over {\partial y} } - {\partial A_y \over {\partial z} },  {\partial A_x \over {\partial z} } - {\partial A_z \over {\partial x} },  {\partial A_y \over {\partial x} } - {\partial A_x \over {\partial y} }  \right) \\ &= \left( {\partial A_z \over {\partial y} } - {\partial A_y \over {\partial z} } \right) \mathbf{i} +  \left( {\partial A_x \over {\partial z} } - {\partial A_z \over {\partial x} } \right) \mathbf{j} +  \left( {\partial A_y \over {\partial x} } - {\partial A_x \over {\partial y} } \right) \mathbf{k}  \\ &= \begin{vmatrix}  \mathbf{i} & \mathbf{j} & \mathbf{k} \\[5pt]  \cfrac{\partial}{\partial x} & \cfrac{\partial}{\partial y} & \cfrac{\partial}{\partial z} \\[12pt]  A_x & A_y & A_z  \end{vmatrix} \\ &= \nabla \times \mathbf{A} \end{align}  Many symbolic operations of derivatives can be generalized in a straightforward manner by the gradient operator in Cartesian coordinates. For example, the single-variable product rule has a direct analogue in the multiplication of scalar fields by applying the gradient operator, as in         (   f  g   )   ′   =     f  ′   g   +   f    g  ′      ⟹   ∇   (   ϕ  ψ   )    =     (   ∇  ϕ   )   ψ   +   ϕ   (   ∇  ψ   )      .         superscript    f  g   normal-′        superscript  f  normal-′   g     f   superscript  g  normal-′       normal-⟹     normal-∇    ϕ  ψ              normal-∇  ϕ   ψ     ϕ   normal-∇  ψ        (fg)^{\prime}=f^{\prime}g+fg^{\prime}~{}~{}~{}\Longrightarrow~{}~{}~{}\nabla(%
 \phi\psi)=(\nabla\phi)\psi+\phi(\nabla\psi).     Further notations have been developed for more exotic types of spaces. For calculations in Minkowski space , the D'Alembert operator , also called the D'Alembertian, wave operator, or box operator is represented as   □   normal-□   \Box   , or as   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   when not in conflict with the symbol for the Laplacian.
