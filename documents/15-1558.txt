All-trans-phytoene synthase

All-trans-phytoene synthase (, prephytoene-diphosphate synthase, phytoene synthetase, PSase, geranylgeranyl-diphosphate geranylgeranyltransferase, 15-trans-phytoene synthase) is an enzyme with system name geranylgeranyl-diphosphate:geranylgeranyl-diphosphate geranylgeranyltransferase (all-trans-phytoene forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 geranylgeranyl diphosphate

 
  all-trans-phytoene + 2 diphosphate (overall reaction)
 
(1a) 2 geranylgeranyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + prephytoene diphosphate

(1b) prephytoene diphosphate 
 
 
 
  all-trans-phytoene + diphosphate
 

This enzyme requires Mn2+ for activity.
