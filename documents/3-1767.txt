   Simplicial approximation theorem      Simplicial approximation theorem   In mathematics , the simplicial approximation theorem is a foundational result for algebraic topology , guaranteeing that continuous mappings can be (by a slight deformation) approximated by ones that are piecewise of the simplest kind. It applies to mappings between spaces that are built up from simplices — that is, finite simplicial complexes . The general continuous mapping between such spaces can be represented approximately by the type of mapping that is ( affine -) linear on each simplex into another simplex, at the cost (i) of sufficient barycentric subdivision of the simplices of the domain, and (ii) replacement of the actual mapping by a homotopic one.  This theorem was first proved by L.E.J. Brouwer , by use of the Lebesgue covering theorem (a result based on compactness ). It served to put the homology theory of the time — the first decade of the twentieth century — on a rigorous basis, since it showed that the topological effect (on homology groups ) of continuous mappings could in a given case be expressed in a finitary way. This must be seen against the background of a realisation at the time that continuity was in general compatible with the pathological , in some other areas. This initiated, one could say, the era of combinatorial topology .  There is a further simplicial approximation theorem for homotopies , stating that a homotopy between continuous mappings can likewise be approximated by a combinatorial version.  Formal statement of the theorem  Let   K   K   K   and   L   L   L   be two simplicial complexes . A simplicial mapping     f  :   K  →  L      normal-:  f   normal-→  K  L     f:K\to L   is called a simplicial approximation of a continuous function    F  :    |  K  |   →   |  L  |       normal-:  F   normal-→    K     L      F:|K|\to|L|   if for every point    x  ∈   |  K  |       x    K     x\in|K|   ,     |  f  |    (  x  )         f   x    |f|(x)   belongs to the minimal closed simplex of   L   L   L   containing the point    F   (  x  )       F  x    F(x)   . If   f   f   f   is a simplicial approximation to a continuous map   F   F   F   , then the geometric realization of   f   f   f   ,    |  f  |      f    |f|   is necessarily homotopic to   F   F   F   .  The simplicial approximation theorem states that given any continuous map    F  :    |  K  |   →   |  L  |       normal-:  F   normal-→    K     L      F:|K|\to|L|   there exists a natural number    n  0     subscript  n  0    n_{0}   such that for all    n  ≥   n  0       n   subscript  n  0     n\geq n_{0}   there exists a simplicial approximation    f  :     Bd  n   K   →  L      normal-:  f   normal-→     superscript  Bd  n   K   L     f:\mathrm{Bd}^{n}K\to L   to   F   F   F   (where     Bd   K      Bd  K    \mathrm{Bd}\;K   denotes the barycentric subdivision of   K   K   K   , and     Bd  n   K       superscript  Bd  n   K    \mathrm{Bd}^{n}K   denotes the result of applying barycentric subdivision   n   n   n   times.)
