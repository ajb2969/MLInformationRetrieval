   Topological pair      Topological pair   In mathematics , more specifically algebraic topology , a pair    (  X  ,  A  )     X  A    (X,A)   is shorthand for an inclusion of topological spaces    i  :   A  ↪  X      normal-:  i   normal-↪  A  X     i\colon A\hookrightarrow X   . Sometimes   i   i   i   is assumed to be a cofibration . A morphism from    (  X  ,  A  )     X  A    (X,A)   to    (   X  ′   ,   A  ′   )      superscript  X  normal-′    superscript  A  normal-′     (X^{\prime},A^{\prime})   is given by two maps    f  :   X  →   X  ′       normal-:  f   normal-→  X   superscript  X  normal-′      f\colon X\rightarrow X^{\prime}   and    g  :   A  →   A  ′       normal-:  g   normal-→  A   superscript  A  normal-′      g\colon A\rightarrow A^{\prime}   such that      i  ′   ∘  g   =   f  ∘  i          superscript  i  normal-′   g     f  i     i^{\prime}\circ g=f\circ i   .  Pairs come up mainly in homology theory and cohomology theory , where chains in   A   A   A   are made equivalent to 0, when considered as chains in   X   X   X   .  Heuristically, one often thinks of a pair    (  X  ,  A  )     X  A    (X,A)   as being akin to the quotient space    X  /  A      X  A    X/A   .  There is a functor from spaces to pairs, which sends a space   X   X   X   to the pair    (  X  ,  ∅  )     X     (X,\varnothing)   .  References    .   "  Category:Algebraic topology
