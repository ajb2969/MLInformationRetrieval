Topological pair

In mathematics, more specifically algebraic topology, a pair 
 
 
 
  is shorthand for an inclusion of topological spaces 
 
 
 
 . Sometimes 
 
 
 
  is assumed to be a cofibration. A morphism from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  is given by two maps 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Pairs come up mainly in homology theory and cohomology theory, where chains in 
 
 
 
  are made equivalent to 0, when considered as chains in 
 
 
 
 .
Heuristically, one often thinks of a pair 
 
 
 
  as being akin to the quotient space 
 
 
 
 .
There is a functor from spaces to pairs, which sends a space 
 
 
 
  to the pair 
 
 
 
 .
