Moufang set

In mathematics, a Moufang set is a particular kind of combinatorial system named after Ruth Moufang.
Definition
A Moufang set is a pair 
 
 
 
  where X is a set and 
 
 
 
  is a family of subgroups of the symmetric group 
 
 
 
  indexed by the elements of X. The system satisfies the conditions



 
  fixes y and is simply transitive on 
 
 
 
 ;
Each 
 
 
normalises the family 
 
 
 
 .

Examples
Let K be a field and X the projective line P1(K) over K. Let Ux be the stabiliser of each point x in the group PSL2(K). The Moufang set determines K up to isomorphism or anti-isomorphism: an application of Hua's identity.
A quadratic Jordan division algebra gives rise to a Moufang set structure. If U is the quadratic map on the unital algebra J, let τ denote the permutation of the additive group (J,+) defined by


 
  Then τ defines a Mounfang set structure on J. The Hua maps ha of the Moufang structure are just the quadratic Ua.  note that the link is more natural in terms of J-structures.
