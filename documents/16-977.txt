   Moufang set      Moufang set   In mathematics , a Moufang set is a particular kind of combinatorial system named after Ruth Moufang .  Definition  A Moufang set is a pair    (  X  ;    {   U  x   }    x  ∈  X    )     X   subscript    subscript  U  x      x  X      \left({X;\{U_{x}\}_{x\in X}}\right)   where X is a set and     {   U  x   }    x  ∈  X      subscript    subscript  U  x      x  X     \{U_{x}\}_{x\in X}   is a family of subgroups of the symmetric group    Σ  X     subscript  normal-Σ  X    \Sigma_{X}   indexed by the elements of X . The system satisfies the conditions       U  y     subscript  U  y    U_{y}   fixes y and is simply transitive on    X  ∖   {  y  }       X   y     X\setminus\{y\}   ;  Each    U  y     subscript  U  y    U_{y}    normalises the family     {   U  x   }    x  ∈  X      subscript    subscript  U  x      x  X     \{U_{x}\}_{x\in X}   .   Examples  Let K be a field and X the projective line  P 1 ( K ) over K . Let U x be the stabiliser of each point x in the group PSL 2 ( K ). The Moufang set determines K up to isomorphism or anti-isomorphism : an application of Hua's identity .  A quadratic Jordan division algebra gives rise to a Moufang set structure. If U is the quadratic map on the unital algebra J , let τ denote the permutation of the additive group ( J ,+) defined by       x  ↦   -   x   -  1     =   -    U  x   -  1     (  x  )      .       maps-to  x     superscript  x    1               superscript   subscript  U  x     1    x       x\mapsto-x^{-1}=-U_{x}^{-1}(x)\ .   Then τ defines a Mounfang set structure on J . The Hua maps h a of the Moufang structure are just the quadratic U a .  note that the link is more natural in terms of J-structures .
