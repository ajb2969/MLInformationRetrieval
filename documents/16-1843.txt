Angles between flats




Angles between flats

The concept of angles between lines in the plane and between pairs of two lines, two planes or a line and a plane in space can be generalised to arbitrary dimension. This generalisation was first discussed by Jordan.1 For any pair of flats in a Euclidean space of arbitrary dimension one can define a set of mutual angles which are invariant under isometric transformation of the Euclidean space. If the flats do not intersect, their shortest distance is one more invariant.2 These angles are called canonical3 or principal.4 The concept of angles can be generalised to pairs of flats in a finite-dimensional inner product space over the complex numbers.
Jordan's definition5
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be flats of dimensions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Euclidean space 
 
 
 
 . By definition, a translation of 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  does not alter their mutual angles. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  do not intersect, they will do so upon any translation of 
 
 
 
  which maps some point in 
 
 
 
  to some point in 
 
 
 
 . It can therefore be assumed without loss of generality that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  intersect.
Jordan shows that Cartesian coordinates






 
  in 
 
 
 
  can then be defined such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are described, respectively, by the sets of equations









and









with 
 
 
 
 . Jordan calls these coordinates canonical. By definition, the angles 
 
 
 
  are the angles between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The non-negative integers 
 
 
 
  are constrained by









For these equations to determine the five non-negative integers completely, besides the dimensions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and the number 
 
 
 
  of angles 
 
 
 
 , the non-negative integer 
 
 
 
  must be given. This is the number of coordinates 
 
 
 
 , whose corresponding axes are those lying entirely within both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The integer 
 
 
 
  is thus the dimension of 
 
 
 
 . The set of angles 
 
 
 
  may be supplemented with 
 
 
 
  angles 
 
 
 
  to indicate that 
 
 
 
  has that dimension.
Jordan's proof applies essentially unaltered when 
 
 
 
  is replaced with the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional inner product space 
 
 
 
  over the complex numbers. (For angles between subspaces, the generalisation to 
 
 
 
  is discussed by Galántai and Hegedũs in terms of the below variational characterisation.6)
Angles between subspaces
Now let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be subspaces of the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional inner product space over the real or complex numbers. Geometrically, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are flats, so Jordan's definition of mutual angles applies. When for any canonical coordinate 
 
 
 
  the symbol 
 
 
 
  denotes the unit vector of the 
 
 
 
  axis, the vectors 
 
 


 
  form an orthonormal basis for 
 
 
 
  and the vectors 
 
 


 
  form an orthonormal basis for 
 
 
 
 , where



Being related to canonical coordinates, these basic vectors may be called canonical.
When 
 
 
 
  denote the canonical basic vectors for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the canonical basic vectors for 
 
 
 
  then the inner product 
 
 
 
  vanishes for any pair of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  except the following ones.






With the above ordering of the basic vectors, the matrix of the inner products 
 
 
 
  is thus diagonal. In other words, if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are arbitrary orthonormal bases in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  then the real, orthogonal or unitary transformations from the basis 
 
 
 
  to the basis 
 
 
 
  and from the basis 
 
 
 
  to the basis 
 
 
 
  realise a singular value decomposition of the matrix of inner products 
 
 
 
 . The diagonal matrix elements 
 
 
 
  are the singular values of the latter matrix. By the uniqueness of the singular value decomposition, the vectors 
 
 
 
  are then unique up to a real, orthogonal or unitary transformation among them, and the vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (and hence 
 
 
 
 ) are unique up to equal real, orthogonal or unitary transformations applied simultaneously to the sets of the vectors 
 
 
 
  associated with a common value of 
 
 
 
  and to the corresponding sets of vectors 
 
 
 
  (and hence to the corresponding sets of 
 
 
 
 ).
A singular value 
 
 
 
  can be interpreted as 
 
 
 
  corresponding to the angles 
 
 
 
  introduced above and associated with 
 
 
 
  and a singular value 
 
 
 
  can be interpreted as 
 
 
 
  corresponding to right angles between the orthogonal spaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where superscript 
 
 
 
  denotes the orthogonal complement.
Variational characterisation7
The variational characterisation of singular vaues and vectors implies as a special case a variational characterisation of the angles between subspaces and their associated canonical vectors. This characterisation includes the angles 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  introduced above and orders the angles by increasing value. It can be given the form of the below alternative definition. In this context, it is customary to talk of principal angles and vectors.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be an inner product space. Given two subspaces 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , there exists then a sequence of 
 
 
 
  angles 
 
 
 
  called the principal angles, the first one defined as



where 
 
 
 
  is the inner product and 
 
 
 
  the induced norm. The vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the corresponding principal vectors.
The other principal angles and vectors are then defined recursively via



This means that the principal angles 
 
 
 
  form a set of minimized angles between the two subspaces, and the principal vectors in each subspace are orthogonal to each other.
Examples
Geometric example
Geometrically, subspaces are flats (points, lines, planes etc.) that include the origin, thus any two subspaces intersect at least in the origin. Two two-dimensional subspaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  generate a set of two angles. In a three-dimensional Euclidean space, the subspaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are either identical, or their intersection forms a line. In the former case, both 
 
 
 
 . In the latter case, only 
 
 
 
 , where vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are on the line of the intersection 
 
 
 
  and have the same direction. The angle 
 
 
 
  will be the angle between the subspaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in the orthogonal complement to 
 
 
 
 . Imagining the angle between two planes in 3D, one intuitively thinks of the largest angle, 
 
 
 
 .
Algebraic example
In 4-dimensional real coordinate space R4, let the two-dimensional subspace 
 
 
 
  be spanned by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , while the two-dimensional subspace 
 
 
 
  be spanned by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with some real 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are, in fact, the pair of principal vectors corresponding to the angle 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the principal vectors corresponding to the angle 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 

To construct a pair of subspaces with any given set of 
 
 
 
  angles 
 
 
 
  in a 
 
 
 
  (or larger) dimensional Euclidean space, take a subspace 
 
 
 
  with an orthonormal basis 
 
 
 
  and complete it to an orthonormal basis 
 
 
 
  of the Euclidean space, where 
 
 
 
 . Then, an orthonormal basis of the other subspace 
 
 
 
  is, e.g.,



Basic properties
If the largest angle is zero, one subspace is a subset of the other.
If the smallest angle is zero, the subspaces intersect at least in a line.
The number of angles equal to zero is the dimension of the space where the two subspaces intersect.
