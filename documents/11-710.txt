   Enamidase      Enamidase   In enzymology , an enamidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-oxo-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinate + 2 H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-formylglutarate + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-oxo-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 2-formylglutarate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-oxo-1,4,5,6-tetrahydronicotinate amidohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
