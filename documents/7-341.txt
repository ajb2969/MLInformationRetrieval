   Density on a manifold      Density on a manifold   In mathematics , and specifically differential geometry , a density is a spatially varying quantity on a differentiable manifold which can be integrated in an intrinsic manner. Abstractly, a density is a section of a certain trivial  line bundle , called the density bundle . An element of the density bundle at x is a function that assigns a volume for the parallelotope spanned by the n given tangent vectors at x .  From the operational point of view, a density is a collection of functions on coordinate charts which become multiplied by the absolute value of the Jacobian determinant in the change of coordinates. Densities can be generalized into s -densities , whose coordinate representations become multiplied by the s -th power of the absolute value of the jacobian determinant. On an oriented manifold 1-densities can be canonically identified with the n -forms on M . On non-orientable manifolds this identification cannot be made, since the density bundle is the tensor product of the orientation bundle of M and the n -th exterior product bundle of T*M (see pseudotensor .)  Motivation (Densities in vector spaces)  In general, there does not exist a natural concept of a "volume" for a parallelotope generated by vectors in a n -dimensional vector space V . However, if one wishes to define a function  that assigns a volume for any such parallelotope, it should satisfy the following properties:   If any of the vectors v k is multiplied by , the volume should be multiplied by | λ |.  If any linear combination of the vectors v 1 , ..., ''v j''−1 , ''v j''+1 , ..., v n is added to the vector v j , the volume should stay invariant.   These conditions are equivalent to the statement that μ is given by a translation-invariant measure on V , and they can be rephrased as         μ   (   A   v  1    ,  …  ,   A   v  n    )    =    |   det  A   |   μ   (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )     ,   A  ∈   GL   (  V  )      .     formulae-sequence      μ     A   subscript  v  1    normal-…    A   subscript  v  n            A    μ    subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n        A   GL  V      \mu(Av_{1},\ldots,Av_{n})=\left|\det A\right|\mu(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}),\quad A%
 \in\operatorname{GL}(V).     Any such mapping  is called a density on the vector space V . The set Vol( V ) of all densities on V forms a one-dimensional vector space, and any n -form ω on V defines a density    |  ω  |      ω    |ω|   on V by         |  ω  |    (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )    :=   |   ω   (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )    |    .     assign      ω     subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n         ω    subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n        |\omega|(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}):=|\omega(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n})|.

 \in\operatorname{GL}(V).     Just like densities, s -densities form a one-dimensional vector space Vol s ( V ), and any n -form ω on V defines an s -density | ω | s on V by          |  ω  |   s    (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )    :=    |   ω   (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )    |   s    .     assign     superscript    ω   s     subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n      superscript      ω    subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n      s     |\omega|^{s}(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}):=|\omega(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n})|^{s}.     The product of s 1 - and s 2 -densities μ 1 and μ 2 form an ( s 1 + s 2 )-density μ by        μ   (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )    :=    μ  1    (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )    μ  2    (   v  1   ,  …  ,   v  n   )     .     assign    μ    subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n        subscript  μ  1     subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n     subscript  μ  2     subscript  v  1   normal-…   subscript  v  n       \mu(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}):=\mu_{1}(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n})\mu_{2}(v_{1},\ldots,v_{n}).     In terms of tensor product spaces this fact can be stated as          Vol   s  1     (  V  )    ⊗    Vol   s  2     (  V  )     =    Vol    s  1   +   s  2      (  V  )     .       tensor-product    superscript  Vol   subscript  s  1    V     superscript  Vol   subscript  s  2    V      superscript  Vol     subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2     V     \operatorname{Vol}^{s_{1}}(V)\otimes\operatorname{Vol}^{s_{2}}(V)=%
 \operatorname{Vol}^{s_{1}+s_{2}}(V).     Definition  Formally, the s -density bundle Vol s ( M ) of a differentiable manifold M is obtained by an associated bundle construction, intertwining the one-dimensional group representation        ρ   (  A  )    =    |   det  A   |    -  s     ,   A  ∈   GL   (  n  )        formulae-sequence      ρ  A    superscript      A      s       A   GL  n      \rho(A)=\left|\det A\right|^{-s},\quad A\in\operatorname{GL}(n)     of the general linear group with the frame bundle of M .  The resulting line bundle is known as the bundle of s -densities, and is denoted by         |  Λ  |   M  s   =     |  Λ  |   s    (   T  M   )     .       subscript   superscript    normal-Λ   s   M      superscript    normal-Λ   s     T  M      \left|\Lambda\right|^{s}_{M}=\left|\Lambda\right|^{s}(TM).   A 1-density is also referred to simply as a density.  More generally, the associated bundle construction also allows densities to be constructed from any vector bundle  E on M .  In detail, if ( U α ,φ α ) is an atlas of coordinate charts on M , then there is associated a local trivialization of     |  Λ  |   M  s     subscript   superscript    normal-Λ   s   M    \left|\Lambda\right|^{s}_{M}          t  α   :       |  Λ  |   M  s   |    U  α    →     ϕ  α    (   U  α   )    ×  ℝ       normal-:   subscript  t  α    normal-→   evaluated-at   subscript   superscript    normal-Λ   s   M    subscript  U  α         subscript  ϕ  α    subscript  U  α    ℝ      t_{\alpha}:\left|\Lambda\right|^{s}_{M}|_{U_{\alpha}}\to\phi_{\alpha}(U_{%
 \alpha})\times\mathbb{R}     subordinate to the open cover U α such that the associated GL(1)- cocycle satisfies        t   α  β    =    |   det   (     d   ϕ  α    ∘  d    ϕ  β   -  1     )    |    -  s     .       subscript  t    α  β     superscript            d   subscript  ϕ  α    d    superscript   subscript  ϕ  β     1         s      t_{\alpha\beta}=\left|\det(d\phi_{\alpha}\circ d\phi_{\beta}^{-1})\right|^{-s}.     Integration  Densities play a significant role in the theory of integration on manifolds. Indeed, the definition of a density is motivated by how a measure dx changes under a change of coordinates .  Given a 1-density ƒ supported in a coordinate chart U α , the integral is defined by        ∫   U  α    f   =    ∫    ϕ  α    (   U  α   )        t  α   ∘  f  ∘   ϕ  α   -  1     d  μ          subscript    subscript  U  α    f     subscript      subscript  ϕ  α    subscript  U  α          subscript  t  α   f   superscript   subscript  ϕ  α     1     d  μ      \int_{U_{\alpha}}f=\int_{\phi_{\alpha}(U_{\alpha})}t_{\alpha}\circ f\circ\phi_%
 {\alpha}^{-1}d\mu   where the latter integral is with respect to the Lebesgue measure on R n . The transformation law for 1-densities together with the Jacobian change of variables ensures compatibility on the overlaps of different coordinate charts, and so the integral of a general compactly supported 1-density can be defined by a partition of unity argument. Thus 1-densities are a generalization of the notion of a volume form that does not necessarily require the manifold to be oriented or even orientable. One can more generally develop a general theory of Radon measures as distributional sections of     |  Λ  |   M  1     subscript   superscript    normal-Λ   1   M    |\Lambda|^{1}_{M}   using the Riesz representation theorem .  The set of 1/p -densities such that      |  ϕ  |   p   =    (   ∫    |  ϕ  |   p    )    1  /  p    <  ∞         subscript    ϕ   p    superscript     superscript    ϕ   p      1  p             |\phi|_{p}=(\int|\phi|^{p})^{1/p}<\infty   is a normed linear space whose completion     L  p    (  M  )        superscript  L  p   M    L^{p}(M)   is called the intrinsic L p space of M .  Conventions  In some areas, particularly conformal geometry , a different weighting convention is used: the bundle of s -densities is instead associated with the character        ρ   (  A  )    =    |   det  A   |    -   s  /  n      .        ρ  A    superscript      A        s  n       \rho(A)=\left|\det A\right|^{-s/n}.   With this convention, for instance, one integrates n -densities (rather than 1-densities). Also in these conventions, a conformal metric is identified with a tensor density of weight 2.  Properties   The dual vector bundle of     |  Λ  |   M  s     subscript   superscript    normal-Λ   s   M    |\Lambda|^{s}_{M}   is     |  Λ  |   M   -  s      subscript   superscript    normal-Λ     s    M    |\Lambda|^{-s}_{M}   .  Tensor densities are sections of the tensor product of a density bundle with a tensor bundle.   References    .     "  Category:Manifolds
