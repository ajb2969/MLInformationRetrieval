Formate kinase

In enzymology, a formate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + formate 
 
 
 
  ADP + formyl phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and formate, whereas its two products are ADP and formyl phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a carboxy group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:formate phosphotransferase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
