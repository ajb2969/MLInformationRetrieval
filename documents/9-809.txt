   Infinite arithmetic series      Infinite arithmetic series   In mathematics, an infinite arithmetic series is an infinite series whose terms are in an arithmetic progression . Examples are  and . The general form for an infinite arithmetic series is        ∑   n  =  0   ∞    (    a  n   +  b   )    .      superscript   subscript     n  0          a  n   b     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(an+b).     If a = b = 0 , then the sum of the series is 0. If either a or b is nonzero while the other is, then the series diverges and has no sum in the usual sense.  Zeta regularization  The zeta-regularized sum of an arithmetic series of the right form is a value of the associated Hurwitz zeta function ,         ∑   n  =  0   ∞    (   n  +  β   )    =    ζ  H    (   -  1   ;  β  )     .        superscript   subscript     n  0        n  β       subscript  ζ  H      1   β      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(n+\beta)=\zeta_{H}(-1;\beta).   Although zeta regularization sums 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + · · · to ζ R (0) = − 1 ⁄ 2 and  to ζ R (−1) = − 1 ⁄ 12 , where ζ is the Riemann zeta function , the above form is not in general equal to        -   1  12    -   β  2    .          1  12      β  2     -\frac{1}{12}-\frac{\beta}{2}.
