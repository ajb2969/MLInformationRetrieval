   Szegő kernel      Szegő kernel   In the mathematical study of several complex variables , the Szegő kernel is an integral kernel that gives rise to a reproducing kernel on a natural Hilbert space of holomorphic functions . It is named for its discoverer, the Hungarian mathematician Gábor Szegő .  Let Ω be a bounded domain in C n with C 2 boundary, and let A (Ω) denote the set of all holomorphic functions in Ω that are continuous on    Ω  ¯     normal-¯  normal-Ω    \overline{\Omega}   . Define the Hardy space  H 2 (∂Ω) to be the closure in L 2 (∂Ω) of the restrictions of elements of A (Ω) to the boundary. The Poisson integral implies that each element ƒ of H 2 (∂Ω) extends to a holomorphic function Pƒ in Ω. Furthermore, for each z ∈ Ω, the map      f  ↦   P  f   (  z  )       maps-to  f    P  f  z     f\mapsto Pf(z)   defines a continuous linear functional on H 2 (∂Ω). By the Riesz representation theorem , this linear functional is represented by a kernel k z , which is to say        P  f   (  z  )    =    ∫   ∂  Ω     f   (  ζ  )       k  z    (  ζ  )    ¯    d  σ   (  ζ  )      .        P  f  z     subscript     normal-Ω      f  ζ   normal-¯     subscript  k  z   ζ    d  σ  ζ      Pf(z)=\int_{\partial\Omega}f(\zeta)\overline{k_{z}(\zeta)}\,d\sigma(\zeta).     The Szegő kernel is defined by         S   (  z  ,  ζ  )    =     k  z    (  ζ  )    ¯    ,    z  ∈  Ω   ,   ζ  ∈   ∂  Ω      .     formulae-sequence      S   z  ζ     normal-¯     subscript  k  z   ζ      formulae-sequence    z  normal-Ω     ζ    normal-Ω       S(z,\zeta)=\overline{k_{z}(\zeta)},\quad z\in\Omega,\zeta\in\partial\Omega.   Like its close cousin, the Bergman kernel , the Szegő kernel is holomorphic in z . In fact, if φ i is an orthonormal basis of H 2 (∂Ω) consisting entirely of the restrictions of functions in A (Ω), then a Riesz–Fischer theorem argument shows that        S   (  z  ,  ζ  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   ∞     ϕ  i    (  z  )      ϕ  i    (  ζ  )    ¯      .
