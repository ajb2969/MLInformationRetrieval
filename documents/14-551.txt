   Grothendieck category      Grothendieck category   In mathematics, a Grothendieck category is a certain kind of abelian category , introduced in Alexander Grothendieck 's Tôhoku paper of 1957 1 in order to develop the machinery of homological algebra for modules and for sheaves in a unified manner.  To every algebraic variety    V   V   V   one can associate a Grothendieck category    Qcoh   (  V  )      Qcoh  V    \operatorname{Qcoh}(V)   , consisting of the quasi-coherent sheaves on   V   V   V   . This category encodes all the relevant geometric information about   V   V   V   , and   V   V   V   can be recovered from    Qcoh   (  V  )      Qcoh  V    \operatorname{Qcoh}(V)   . This example gives rise to one approach to noncommutative algebraic geometry : the study of "non-commutative varieties" is then nothing but the study of Grothendieck categories. 2  Definition  By definition, a Grothendieck category   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is an AB5 category with a generator . Spelled out, this means that      𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is an abelian category ;  every (possibly infinite) family of objects in   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   has a coproduct (a.k.a. direct sum) in   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   ;  direct limits (a.k.a. filtered colimits) of exact sequences are exact; this means that if a direct system of short exact sequences in   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is given, then the induced sequence of direct limits is a short exact sequence as well. (Direct limits are always right-exact ; the important point here is that we require them to be left-exact as well.)     𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   possesses a generator, i.e. there is an object   G   G   G   in   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   such that    Hom   (  G  ,  -  )      Hom  G     \operatorname{Hom}(G,-)   is a faithful functor from   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   to the category of sets . (In our situation, this is equivalent to saying that every object   X   X   X   of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   admits an epimorphism      G   (  I  )    →  X     normal-→   superscript  G  I   X    G^{(I)}\rightarrow X   , where    G   (  I  )      superscript  G  I    G^{(I)}   denotes a direct sum of copies of   G   G   G   , one for each element of the (possibly infinite) set   I   I   I   .)   Examples   The prototypical example of a Grothendieck category is the category of abelian groups ; the abelian group   ℤ   ℤ   \mathbb{Z}   of integers can serve as a generator.  More generally, given any ring    R   R   R   (associative, with   1   1   1   , but not necessarily commutative), the category    Mod   (  R  )      Mod  R    \operatorname{Mod}(R)   of all right (or alternatively: left) modules over   R   R   R   is a Grothendieck category;   R   R   R   itself can serve as a generator.  Given a topological space    X   X   X   , the category of all sheaves of abelian groups on   X   X   X   is a Grothendieck category. (More generally: the category of all sheaves of left   R   R   R   -modules on   X   X   X   is a Grothendieck category for any ring   R   R   R   .)  Given a ringed space     (  X  ,   𝒪  X   )     X   subscript  𝒪  X     (X,\mathcal{O}_{X})   , the category of sheaves of O X -modules is a Grothendieck category.  Given an (affine or projective) algebraic variety    V   V   V   (or more generally: a quasi-compact  quasi-separated  scheme ), the category    Qcoh   (  V  )      Qcoh  V    \operatorname{Qcoh}(V)   of quasi-coherent sheaves on   V   V   V   is a Grothendieck category.  Any category that's equivalent to a Grothendieck category is itself a Grothendieck category.  Given a small category    𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   and a Grothendieck category   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   , the functor category     Funct   (  𝒞  ,  𝒜  )      Funct  𝒞  𝒜    \operatorname{Funct}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{A})   is a Grothendieck category; if   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   is preadditive , then the functor category    Add   (  𝒞  ,  𝒜  )      Add  𝒞  𝒜    \operatorname{Add}(\mathcal{C},\mathcal{A})   of all additive functors from   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   to   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is a Grothendieck category as well.  If   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is a Grothendieck category and   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   is a localizing subcategory of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   , we can form the Serre quotient category     𝒜  /  𝒞      𝒜  𝒞    \mathcal{A}/\mathcal{C}   . This quotient is again a Grothendieck category.   Properties  Every Grothendieck category contains an injective cogenerator . For example, an injective cogenerator of the category of abelian groups is the quotient group     ℚ  /  ℤ      ℚ  ℤ    \mathbb{Q}/\mathbb{Z}   .  Every object in a Grothendieck category   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   has an injective hull in   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   . This allows to construct injective resolutions and thereby the use of the tools of homological algebra in   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   , such as derived functors . (Note that not all Grothendieck categories allow projective resolutions for all objects; examples are categories of sheaves of abelian groups on many topological spaces, such as on the space of real numbers.)  In a Grothendieck category, any family of subobjects     (   U  i   )     subscript  U  i    (U_{i})   of a given object   X   X   X   has a supremum      ∑  i    U  i       subscript   i    subscript  U  i     \sum_{i}U_{i}   which is again a subobject of   X   X   X   . (Note that an infimum need not exist.) Further, if the family    (   U  i   )     subscript  U  i    (U_{i})   is directed (i.e. for any two objects in the family, there is a third object in the family that contains the two), and   V   V   V   is another subobject of   X   X   X   , we have         ∑  i    (    U  i   ∩  V   )    =    (    ∑  i    U  i    )   ∩  V    .        subscript   i      subscript  U  i   V        subscript   i    subscript  U  i    V     \sum_{i}(U_{i}\cap V)=\left(\sum_{i}U_{i}\right)\cap V.     In a Grothendieck category, arbitrary limits (and in particular products ) exist. It follows directly from the definition that arbitrary colimits and coproducts (direct sums) exist as well. We can thus say that every Grothendieck category is complete and co-complete . Coproducts in a Grothendieck category are exact (i.e. the coproduct of a family of short exact sequences is again a short exact sequence), but products need not be exact.  The Gabriel–Popescu theorem states that any Grothendieck category   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   is equivalent to a full subcategory of the category    Mod   (  R  )      Mod  R    \operatorname{Mod}(R)   of right modules over some unital ring   R   R   R   (which can be taken to be the endomorphism ring of a generator of   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   ), and   𝒜   𝒜   \mathcal{A}   can be obtained as a Serre quotient of    Mod   (  R  )      Mod  R    \operatorname{Mod}(R)   by some localizing subcategory. 3  References     .
