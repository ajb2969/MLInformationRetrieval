   Crossing number (knot theory)      Crossing number (knot theory)     In the mathematical area of knot theory , the crossing number of a knot is the smallest number of crossings of any diagram of the knot. It is a knot invariant .  Examples  By way of example, the unknot has crossing number zero , the trefoil knot three and the figure-eight knot four. There are no other knots with a crossing number this low, and just two knots have crossing number five, but the number of knots with a particular crossing number increases rapidly as the crossing number increases.  Tabulation  Tables of prime knots are traditionally indexed by crossing number, with a subscript to indicate which particular knot out of those with this many crossings is meant (this sub-ordering is not based on anything in particular, except that torus knots then twist knots are listed first). The listing goes 3 1 (the trefoil knot), 4 1 (the figure-eight knot), 5 1 , 5 2 , 6 1 , etc. This order has not changed significantly since P. G. Tait published a tabulation of knots in 1877. 1  Additivity  There has been very little progress on understanding the behavior of crossing number under rudimentary operations on knots. A big open question asks if the crossing number is additive when taking knot sums . It is also expected that a satellite of a knot K should have larger crossing number than K , but this has not been proven.  Additivity of crossing number under knot sum has been proven for special cases, for example if the summands are alternating knots 2 (or more generally, adequate knot ), or if the summands are torus knots . 3 4 Marc Lackenby has also given a proof that there is a constant N > 1 such that      1  N    (    cr   (   K  1   )    +   cr   (   K  2   )     )    ≤   cr   (    K  1   +   K  2    )            1  N       cr   subscript  K  1      cr   subscript  K  2        cr     subscript  K  1    subscript  K  2       \frac{1}{N}(\mathrm{cr}(K_{1})+\mathrm{cr}(K_{2}))\leq\mathrm{cr}(K_{1}+K_{2})   , but his method, which utilizes normal surfaces , cannot improve N to 1. 5  Applications in bioinformatics  There are mysterious connections between the crossing number of a knot and the physical behavior of DNA knots. For prime DNA knots, crossing number is a good predictor of the relative velocity of the DNA knot in agarose gel electrophoresis . Basically, the higher the crossing number, the faster the relative velocity. For composite knots, this does not appear to be the case, although experimental conditions can drastically change the results. 6  Related invariants  There are related concepts of average crossing number and asymptotic crossing number . Both of these quantities bound the standard crossing number. Asymptotic crossing number is conjectured to be equal to crossing number.  Other numerical knot invariants include the bridge number , linking number , stick number , and unknotting number .  References    "  Category:Knot invariants     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
