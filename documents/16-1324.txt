   Lieb–Oxford inequality      Lieb–Oxford inequality   In quantum chemistry and physics , the Lieb–Oxford inequality provides a lower bound for the indirect part of the Coulomb energy of a quantum mechanical system. It is named after Elliott H. Lieb and Stephen Oxford .  The inequality is of importance for density functional theory and plays a role in the proof of stability of matter .  Introduction  In classical physics, one can calculate the Coulomb energy of a configuration of charged particles in the following way. First, calculate the charge density    ρ   ρ   ρ   , where   ρ   ρ   ρ   is a function of the coordinates    x  ∈   ℝ  3       x  normal-∈   superscript  normal-ℝ  3     x∈ℝ^{3}   . Second, calculate the Coulomb energy by integrating:        1  2     ∫   ℝ  3      ∫   ℝ  3        ρ   (  x  )   ρ   (  y  )     |   x  -  y   |      d  3    x    d  3   y      .        1  2     subscript    superscript  ℝ  3      subscript    superscript  ℝ  3          ρ  x  ρ  y       x  y      superscript  normal-d  3   x   superscript  normal-d  3   y       \frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\frac{\rho(x)\rho(y)}{|x-%
 y|}\,\mathrm{d}^{3}x\,\mathrm{d}^{3}y.     In other words, for each pair of points   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   , this expression calculates the energy related to the fact that the charge at   x   x   x   is attracted to or repelled from the charge at   y   y   y   . The factor of    1  /  2      1  2    {1}/{2}   corrects for double-counting the pairs of points.  In quantum mechanics, it is also possible to calculate a charge density   ρ   ρ   ρ   , which is a function of    x  ∈   ℝ  3       x  normal-∈   superscript  normal-ℝ  3     x∈ℝ^{3}   . More specifically,   ρ   ρ   ρ   is defined as the expectation value of charge density at each point. But in this case, the above formula for Coulomb energy is not correct, due to exchange and correlation effects. The above, classical formula for Coulomb energy is then called the "direct" part of Coulomb energy. To get the actual Coulomb energy, it is necessary to add a correction term, called the "indirect" part of Coulomb energy. The Lieb–Oxford inequality concerns this indirect part. It is relevant in density functional theory , where the expectation value ρ plays a central role.  Statement of the inequality  For a quantum mechanical system of   N   N   N   particles, each with charge   e   e   e   , the   N   N   N   -particle density is denoted by       P   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   )    .      P    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N      P(x_{1},\dots,x_{N}).     The function   P   P   P   is only assumed to be non-negative and normalized . Thus the following applies to particles with any "statistics". For example, if the system is described by a normalised square integrable    N   N   N   -particle wave function       ψ  ∈    L  2    (   ℝ   3  N    )     ,      ψ     superscript  L  2    superscript  ℝ    3  N       \psi\in L^{2}(\mathbb{R}^{3N}),     then        P   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   )    =    |   ψ   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   )    |   2    .        P    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N      superscript      ψ    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N      2     P(x_{1},\dots,x_{N})=|\psi(x_{1},\dots,x_{N})|^{2}.     More generally, in the case of particles with spin having   q   q   q   spin states per particle and with corresponding wave function      ψ   (   x  1   ,   σ  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   ,   σ  N   )       ψ    subscript  x  1    subscript  σ  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N    subscript  σ  N      \psi(x_{1},\sigma_{1},\dots,x_{N},\sigma_{N})   the   N   N   N   -particle density is given by        P   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   )    =    ∑    σ  1   =  1   q    ⋯    ∑    σ  N   =  1   q     |   ψ   (   x  1   ,   σ  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   ,   σ  N   )    |   2       .        P    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N       superscript   subscript      subscript  σ  1   1    q     normal-⋯    superscript   subscript      subscript  σ  N   1    q    superscript      ψ    subscript  x  1    subscript  σ  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N    subscript  σ  N      2        P(x_{1},\dots,x_{N})=\sum_{\sigma_{1}=1}^{q}\cdots\sum_{\sigma_{N}=1}^{q}|\psi%
 (x_{1},\sigma_{1},\dots,x_{N},\sigma_{N})|^{2}.   Alternatively, if the system is described by a density matrix   γ   γ   γ   , then   P   P   P   is the diagonal       γ   (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   ;   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   )    .      γ    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N      \gamma(x_{1},...,x_{N};x_{1},...,x_{N}).     The electrostatic energy of the system is defined as      x  ∈   ℝ  3       x  normal-∈   superscript  normal-ℝ  3     x∈ℝ^{3}     and the direct part of the Coulomb energy of the system of   ρ   ρ   ρ   particles is defined as the electrostatic energy associated with the charge density      D   (  ρ  )    =    1  2     ∫   ℝ  3      ∫   ℝ  3        ρ   (  x  )   ρ   (  y  )     |   x  -  y   |      d  3    x    d  3   y       .        D  ρ       1  2     subscript    superscript  ℝ  3      subscript    superscript  ℝ  3          ρ  x  ρ  y       x  y      superscript  normal-d  3   x   superscript  normal-d  3   y        D(\rho)=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\int_{\mathbb{R}^{3}}\frac{\rho(x)\rho%
 (y)}{|x-y|}\,\mathrm{d}^{3}x\,\mathrm{d}^{3}y.   , i.e.      I  P     subscript  I  P    I_{P}     The Lieb–Oxford inequality states that the difference between the true energy    D   (  ρ  )       D  ρ    D(ρ)   and its semiclassical approximation    C  ≤  1.68      C  normal-≤  1.68    C≤1.68   is bounded from below as  where   N   N   N   is a constant independent of the particle number    E  P     subscript  E  P    E_{P}   .     e  1   ,  …  ,   e  N       subscript  e  1   normal-…   subscript  e  N     e_{1},...,e_{N}   is referred to as the indirect part of the Coulomb energy and in density functional theory more commonly as the exchange plus correlation energy . A similar bound exists if the particles have different charges    E  P     subscript  E  P    E_{P}   . No upper bound is possible for    C  =  8.52      C  8.52    C=8.52   .  The optimal constant  While the original proof yielded the constant    C  =  1.68      C  1.68    C=1.68   , 1 Lieb and Oxford managed to refine this result to    C  =  1.64      C  1.64    C=1.64   . 2 Later, the same method of proof was used to further improve the constant to   N   N   N   . 3 With these constants the inequality holds for any particle number   N   N   N   .  The constant can be further improved if the particle number    N  =  1      N  1    N=1   is restricted. In the case of a single particle     I  P   =  0       subscript  I  P   0    I_{P}=0   the Coulomb energy vanishes,     C  1   =  1.092       subscript  C  1   1.092    C_{1}=1.092   , and the smallest possible constant can be computed explicitly as   ρ   ρ   ρ   . 4 The corresponding variational equation for the optimal    N  =  2      N  2    N=2   is the Lane–Emden equation of order 3. For two particles (     C  2   ≥  1.234       subscript  C  2   normal-≥  1.234    C_{2}≥1.234   ) it is known that the smallest possible constant satisfies    C  N     subscript  C  N    C_{N}   . 5 In general it can be proved that the optimal constants     C  N   ≤   C   N  +  1         subscript  C  N   normal-≤   subscript  C    N  1      C_{N}≤C_{N+1}   increase with the number of particles, i.e   N   N   N   . 6 Any lower bound on the optimal constant for fixed particle number   C   C   C   is also a lower bound on the optimal constant in () for arbitrary particle number. The largest presently known numerically obtained lower bound on    N  =  30      N  30    N=30   was proved for     C  30   ≥  1.31       subscript  C  30   normal-≥  1.31    C_{30}≥1.31   where   C   C   C   . 7 To summarise, the best known bounds for    1.31  ≤  C  ≤  1.64      1.31  normal-≤  C  normal-≤  1.64    1.31≤C≤1.64   are    E  P     subscript  E  P    E_{P}   .  The Dirac constant  Historically, the first approximation of the indirect part      ψ   (   x  1   ,   σ  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   ,   σ  N   )    =    det   (    φ  i    (   x  j   ,   σ  j   )    )      N  !      .        ψ    subscript  x  1    subscript  σ  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N    subscript  σ  N            subscript  φ  i     subscript  x  j    subscript  σ  j          N       \psi(x_{1},\sigma_{1},\dots,x_{N},\sigma_{N})=\frac{\det(\varphi_{i}(x_{j},%

The allowed values of    n  /    |  Λ  |    1  /  3        n   superscript    normal-Λ     1  3      n/|Λ|^{{1}/{3}}   are    n  ∈  ℤ      n  normal-∈  normal-ℤ    n∈ℤ   with   N   N   N   . For large    |  Λ  |      normal-Λ    |Λ|   ,    ρ  =    N   |  e  |    /   |  Λ  |        ρ      N    e      normal-Λ      ρ=N|e|/|Λ|   , and fixed       E  P    (  Dirac  )    =   -   C    |  e  |    2  /  3     q   -   1  /  3      ρ   4  /  3     |  Λ  |      ,         subscript  E  P   Dirac       C   superscript    e     2  3     superscript  q      1  3      superscript  ρ    4  3      normal-Λ       E_{P}(\mathrm{Dirac})=-C|e|^{2/3}q^{-1/3}\rho^{4/3}|\Lambda|,   , the indirect part of the Coulomb energy can be computed to be      C  =  0.93      C  0.93    C=0.93     with   q   q   q   .  This result can be compared to the lower bound (). In contrast to Dirac's approximation the Lieb–Oxford inequality does not include the number   q   q   q   of spin states on the right-hand side. The dependence on   C   C   C   in Dirac's formula is a consequence of his specific choice of wave functions and not a general feature.  Generalisations  The constant   ρ   ρ   ρ   in () can be made smaller at the price of adding another term to the right-hand side. By including a term that involves the gradient of a power of the single particle charge density   C   C   C   , the constant   1.45   1.45   1.45   can be improved to    C  ≤  1.45      C  normal-≤  1.45    C≤1.45   . 9 10 Thus, for a uniform density system $C ≤ 1.45$ .
