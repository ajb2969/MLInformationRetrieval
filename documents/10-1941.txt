   Aminobenzoate decarboxylase      Aminobenzoate decarboxylase   In enzymology , an aminobenzoate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4(or 2)-aminobenzoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   aniline + CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-aminobenzoate and 2-aminobenzoate , whereas its two products are aniline and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aminobenzoate carboxy-lyase (aniline-forming) . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .
