   B-convex space      B-convex space   In functional analysis , the class of B -convex spaces is a class of Banach space . The concept of B -convexity was defined and used to characterize Banach spaces that have the strong law of large numbers by Anatole Beck in 1962; accordingly, "B-convexity" is understood as an abbreviation of Beck convexity . Beck proved the following theorem: A Banach space is B -convex if and only if every sequence of independent , symmetric, uniformly bounded and Radon random variables in that space satisfies the strong law of large numbers.  Let X be a Banach space with norm || ||. X is said to be B -convex if for some ε > 0 and some natural number  n , it holds true that whenever x 1 , ..., x n are elements of the closed unit ball of X , there is a choice of signs α 1 , ..., α n ∈ {−1, +1} such that        ∥    ∑   i  =  1   n     α  i    x  i     ∥   ≤    (   1  -  ε   )   n    .       norm    superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  α  i    subscript  x  i          1  ε   n     \left\|\sum_{i=1}^{n}\alpha_{i}x_{i}\right\|\leq(1-\varepsilon)n.     Later authors have shown that B-convexity is equivalent to a number of other important properties in the theory of Banach spaces. Being B-convex and having Rademacher type     p  >  1      p  1    p>1   were shown to be equivalent Banach-space properties by Gilles Pisier .
