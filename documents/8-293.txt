   Range criterion      Range criterion   In quantum mechanics , in particular quantum information , the Range criterion is a necessary condition that a state must satisfy in order to be separable . In other words, it is a separability criterion .  The result  Consider a quantum mechanical system composed of n subsystems. The state space H of such a system is the tensor product of those of the subsystems, i.e.    H  =    H  1   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   H  n        H   tensor-product   subscript  H  1   normal-⋯   subscript  H  n      H=H_{1}\otimes\cdots\otimes H_{n}   .  For simplicity we will assume throughout that all relevant state spaces are finite-dimensional.  The criterion reads as follows: If ρ is a separable mixed state acting on H , then the range of ρ is spanned by a set of product vectors.  Proof  In general, if a matrix M is of the form    M  =    ∑  i     v  i    v  i  *         M    subscript   i      subscript  v  i    superscript   subscript  v  i         M=\sum_{i}v_{i}v_{i}^{*}   , it is obvious that the range of M , Ran(M) , is contained in the linear span of    {   v  i   }      subscript  v  i     \;\{v_{i}\}   . On the other hand, we can also show    v  i     subscript  v  i    v_{i}   lies in Ran(M) , for all i . Assume without loss of generality i = 1 . We can write    M  =     v  1    v  1  *    +  T       M       subscript  v  1    superscript   subscript  v  1      T     M=v_{1}v_{1}^{*}+T   , where T is Hermitian and positive semidefinite. There are two possibilities:  1) span      {   v  1   }   ⊂         subscript  v  1    absent    \{v_{1}\}\subset    Ker(T) . Clearly, in this case,     v  1   ∈        subscript  v  1   absent    v_{1}\in    Ran(M) .  2) Notice 1) is true if and only if Ker(T)      ⊂    ⟂      superscript   perpendicular-to    \;{}^{\perp}\subset    span      {   v  1   }   ⟂     superscript    subscript  v  1    perpendicular-to    \{v_{1}\}^{\perp}   , where   ⟂   perpendicular-to   \perp   denotes orthogonal compliment. By Hermiticity of T , this is the same as Ran(T)    ⊂     \subset    span      {   v  1   }   ⟂     superscript    subscript  v  1    perpendicular-to    \{v_{1}\}^{\perp}   . So if 1) does not hold, the intersection Ran(T)    ∩     \cap    span     {   v  1   }      subscript  v  1     \{v_{1}\}   is nonempty, i.e. there exists some complex number α such that      T   w   =   α   v  1          T  w     α   subscript  v  1      \;Tw=\alpha v_{1}   . So        M  w   =     ⟨  w  ,   v  1   ⟩    v  1    +   T  w    =    (    ⟨  w  ,   v  1   ⟩   +  α   )    v  1     .          M  w        w   subscript  v  1     subscript  v  1      T  w              w   subscript  v  1    α    subscript  v  1       Mw=\langle w,v_{1}\rangle v_{1}+Tw=(\langle w,v_{1}\rangle+\alpha)v_{1}.     Therefore    v  1     subscript  v  1    v_{1}   lies in Ran(M) .  Thus Ran(M) coincides with the linear span of    {   v  i   }      subscript  v  i     \;\{v_{i}\}   . The range criterion is a special case of this fact.  A density matrix ρ acting on H is separable if and only if it can be written as      ρ  =    ∑  i       ψ   1  ,  i     ψ   1  ,  i   *    ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   ψ   n  ,  i      ψ   n  ,  i   *         ρ    subscript   i      tensor-product     subscript  ψ   1  i     superscript   subscript  ψ   1  i       normal-⋯   subscript  ψ   n  i      superscript   subscript  ψ   n  i          \rho=\sum_{i}\psi_{1,i}\psi_{1,i}^{*}\otimes\cdots\otimes\psi_{n,i}\psi_{n,i}^%
 {*}     where     ψ   j  ,  i     ψ   j  ,  i   *        subscript  ψ   j  i     superscript   subscript  ψ   j  i        \psi_{j,i}\psi_{j,i}^{*}   is a (un-normalized) pure state on the j -th subsystem. This is also       ρ  =    ∑  i     (    ψ   1  ,  i    ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   ψ   n  ,  i     )    (    ψ   1  ,  i   *   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   ψ   n  ,  i   *    )      .      ρ    subscript   i      tensor-product   subscript  ψ   1  i    normal-⋯   subscript  ψ   n  i      tensor-product   superscript   subscript  ψ   1  i      normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  ψ   n  i           \rho=\sum_{i}(\psi_{1,i}\otimes\cdots\otimes\psi_{n,i})(\psi_{1,i}^{*}\otimes%
 \cdots\otimes\psi_{n,i}^{*}).     But this is exactly the same form as M from above, with the vectorial product state     ψ   1  ,  i    ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   ψ   n  ,  i       tensor-product   subscript  ψ   1  i    normal-⋯   subscript  ψ   n  i      \psi_{1,i}\otimes\cdots\otimes\psi_{n,i}   replacing    v  i     subscript  v  i    v_{i}   . It then immediately follows that the range of ρ is the linear span of these product states. This proves the criterion.  References   P.
