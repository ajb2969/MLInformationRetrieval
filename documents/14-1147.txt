   Stanley symmetric function      Stanley symmetric function   In mathematics and especially in algebraic combinatorics , the Stanley symmetric functions are a family of symmetric polynomials introduced by  in his study of the symmetric group of permutations .  Formally, the Stanley symmetric function F w ( x 1 , x 2 , ...) indexed by a permutation w is defined as a sum of certain fundamental quasisymmetric functions . Each summand corresponds to a reduced decomposition of w , that is, to a way of writing w as a product of a minimal possible number of adjacent transpositions . They were introduced in the course of Stanley's enumeration of the reduced decompositions of permutations, and in particular his proof that the permutation w 0 = n ( n − 1)...21 (written here in one-line notation ) has exactly        (      n      2      )   !      1   n  -  1    ⋅   3   n  -  2    ⋅   5   n  -  3     ⋯    (    2  n   -  3   )   1           binomial  n  2       normal-⋅   superscript  1    n  1     superscript  3    n  2     superscript  5    n  3     normal-⋯   superscript      2  n   3   1      \frac{{\left({{n}\atop{2}}\right)}!}{1^{n-1}\cdot 3^{n-2}\cdot 5^{n-3}\cdots(2%
 n-3)^{1}}   reduced decompositions. (Here    (      n      2      )     binomial  n  2    {\left({{n}\atop{2}}\right)}   denotes the binomial coefficient  n ( n − 1)/2 and ! denotes the factorial .)  Properties  The Stanley symmetric function F w is homogeneous with degree equal to the number of inversions of w . Unlike other nice families of symmetric functions, the Stanley symmetric functions have many linear dependencies and so do not form a basis of the ring of symmetric functions . When a Stanley symmetric function is expanded in the basis of Schur functions , the coefficients are all non-negative  integers .
