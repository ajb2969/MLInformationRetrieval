   Sinapoylglucose—choline O-sinapoyltransferase      Sinapoylglucose—choline O-sinapoyltransferase   In enzymology , a sinapoylglucose---choline O-sinapoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1-O-sinapoyl-beta-D-glucose + choline   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose + sinapoylcholine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-O-sinapoyl-beta-D-glucose and choline , whereas its two products are D-glucose and sinapoylcholine (sinapine).  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-O-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxycinnamoyl)-beta-D-glucose:choline 1-O-(4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxycinnamoyl)transferase . This enzyme is also called sinapine synthase . This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
