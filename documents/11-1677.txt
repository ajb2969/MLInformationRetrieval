   Glass batch calculation      Glass batch calculation   Glass batch calculation or glass batching is used to determine the correct mix of raw materials (batch) for a glass melt.  Principle  The raw materials mixture for glass melting is termed "batch". The batch must be measured properly to achieve a given, desired glass formulation. This batch calculation is based on the common linear regression equation:       N  B   =     (    B  T   ⋅  B   )    -  1    ⋅   B  T   ⋅   N  G         subscript  N  B    normal-⋅   superscript   normal-⋅   superscript  B  T   B     1     superscript  B  T    subscript  N  G      N_{B}=(B^{T}\cdot B)^{-1}\cdot B^{T}\cdot N_{G}     with N B and N G being the molarities 1-column matrices of the batch and glass components respectively, and B being the batching matrix . 1 2 3 The symbol " T " stands for the matrix transpose operation, " −1 " indicates matrix inversion , and the sign "·" means the scalar product . From the molarities matrices N, percentages by weight (wt%) can easily be derived using the appropriate molar masses .  Example calculation  An example batch calculation may be demonstrated here. The desired glass composition in wt% is: 67 SiO 2 , 12 Na 2 O , 10 CaO , 5 Al 2 O 3 , 1 K 2 O , 2 MgO , 3 B 2 O 3 , and as raw materials are used sand , trona , lime , albite , orthoclase , dolomite , and borax . The formulas and molar masses of the glass and batch components are listed in the following table:      Formula of glass component   Desired concentration of glass component, wt%   Molar mass of glass component, g/mol   Batch component   Formula of batch component   Molar mass of batch component, g/mol       SiO 2   67   60.0843   Sand   SiO 2   60.0843     Na 2 O   12   61.9789   Trona   Na 3 H(CO 3 ) 2 *2H 2 O   226.0262     CaO   10   56.0774   Lime   CaCO 3   100.0872     Al 2 O 3   5   101.9613   Albite   Na 2 O*Al 2 O 3 *6SiO 2   524.4460     K 2 O   1   94.1960   Orthoclase   K 2 O*Al 2 O 3 *6SiO 2   556.6631     MgO   2   40.3044   Dolomite   MgCa(CO 3 ) 2   184.4014     B 2 O 3   3   69.6202   Borax   Na 2 B 4 O 7 *10H 2 O   381.3721     The batching matrix B indicates the relation of the molarity in the batch (columns) and in the glass (rows). For example, the batch component SiO 2 adds 1 mol SiO 2 to the glass, therefore, the intersection of the first column and row shows "1". Trona adds 1.5 mol Na 2 O to the glass; albite adds 6 mol SiO 2 , 1 mol Na 2 O, and 1 mol Al 2 O 3 , and so on. For the example given above, the complete batching matrix is listed below. The molarity matrix N G of the glass is simply determined by dividing the desired wt% concentrations by the appropriate molar masses, e.g., for SiO 2 67/60.0843 = 1.1151.

If this batch is melted to a glass, the desired composition given above is obtained. 4 During glass melting, carbon dioxide (from trona, lime, dolomite) and water (from trona, borax) evaporate.  Another simple glass batch calculation can be found at the website of the University of Washington. 5  Advanced batch calculation by optimization  If the number of glass and batch components is not equal, if it is impossible to exactly obtain the desired glass composition using the selected batch ingredients, or if the matrix equation is not soluble for other reasons (e.g., correlation ), the batch composition must be determined by optimization techniques .
