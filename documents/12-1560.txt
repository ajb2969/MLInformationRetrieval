   Projected area      Projected area   (Figure)  Example of a projected area from a hardness indentation.   Projected area is two-dimensional area measurement of a three-dimensional object by projecting its shape on to an arbitrary plane. This is often used in mechanical engineering and architectural engineering related fields, specifically hardness testing, axial stress , wind pressures, and terminal velocity .  The geometrical definition of a projected area is: "the rectilinear parallel projection of a surface of any shape onto a plane". This translates into the equation:       A   p  r  o  j  e  c  t  e  d    =    ∫  A    cos    β   d  A          subscript  A    p  r  o  j  e  c  t  e  d      subscript   A       β  d  A       A_{projected}=\int_{A}\cos{\beta}\,dA     where A is the original area, and    β    β   \beta\,   is the angle between the normal to the surface A and the normal to the arbitrary plane onto which we project. For basic shapes the results are listed in the table below. 1      Projected area for basic shapes 2     Shape     Flat rectangle     Circular disc     Sphere     References  "  Category:Engineering  Category:Metalworking terminology     . ↩
