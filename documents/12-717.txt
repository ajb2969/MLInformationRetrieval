   Monogenic field      Monogenic field   In mathematics , a monogenic field is an algebraic number field  K for which there exists an element a such that the ring of integers  O K is the polynomial ring  Z [ a ]. The powers of such an element a constitute a power integral basis .  In a monogenic field K , the field discriminant of K is equal to the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of α.  Examples  Examples of monogenic fields include:   Quadratic fields :    if    K  =   𝐐   (   d   )        K    𝐐    d      K=\mathbf{Q}(\sqrt{d})   with   d   d   d   a square-free integer , then     O  K   =   𝐙   [  a  ]         subscript  O  K     𝐙   delimited-[]  a      O_{K}=\mathbf{Z}[a]   where    a  =    (   1  +   d    )   /  2       a      1    d    2     a=(1+\sqrt{d})/2   if d ≡1 (mod 4) and    a  =   d       a    d     a=\sqrt{d}   if d ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4).    Cyclotomic fields :    if    K  =   𝐐   (  ζ  )        K    𝐐  ζ     K=\mathbf{Q}(\zeta)   with   ζ   ζ   \zeta   a root of unity , then      O  K   =   𝐙   [  ζ  ]     .       subscript  O  K     𝐙   delimited-[]  ζ      O_{K}=\mathbf{Z}[\zeta].   Also the maximal real subfield     𝐐    (  ζ  )   +    =   𝐐   (   ζ  +   ζ   -  1     )          𝐐   superscript  ζ       𝐐    ζ   superscript  ζ    1        \mathbf{Q}(\zeta)^{+}=\mathbf{Q}(\zeta+\zeta^{-1})   is monogenic, with ring of integers     𝐙   [   ζ  +   ζ   -  1     ]    .      𝐙   delimited-[]    ζ   superscript  ζ    1        \mathbf{Z}[\zeta+\zeta^{-1}].      While all quadratic fields are monogenic, already among cubic fields there are many that are not monogenic. The first example of a non-monogenic number field that was found is the cubic field generated by a root of the polynomial     X  3   -   X  2   -   2  X   -  8       superscript  X  3    superscript  X  2     2  X   8    X^{3}-X^{2}-2X-8   , due to Richard Dedekind .
