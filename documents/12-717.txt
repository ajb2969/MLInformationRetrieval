Monogenic field

In mathematics, a monogenic field is an algebraic number field K for which there exists an element a such that the ring of integers OK is the polynomial ring Z[a]. The powers of such an element a constitute a power integral basis.
In a monogenic field K, the field discriminant of K is equal to the discriminant of the minimal polynomial of α.
Examples
Examples of monogenic fields include:

Quadratic fields:


if 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  a square-free integer, then 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  if d≡1 (mod 4) and 
 
 
 
  if d ≡ 2 or 3 (mod 4).
 


Cyclotomic fields:


if 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  a root of unity, then 
 
 
 
  Also the maximal real subfield 
 
 
 
  is monogenic, with ring of integers 
 
 


While all quadratic fields are monogenic, already among cubic fields there are many that are not monogenic. The first example of a non-monogenic number field that was found is the cubic field generated by a root of the polynomial 
 
 
 
 , due to Richard Dedekind.
