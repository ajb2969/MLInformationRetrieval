   Solid Klein bottle      Solid Klein bottle   In mathematics , a solid Klein bottle is a three-dimensional topological space (a 3-manifold ) whose boundary is the Klein bottle . 1  It is homeomorphic to the quotient space obtained by gluing the top disk of a cylinder      D  2   ×  I       superscript  D  2   I    \scriptstyle D^{2}\times I   to the bottom disk by a reflection across a diameter of the disk.  Alternatively, one can visualize the solid Klein bottle as the trivial product      M   o  ¨    ×  I        M   normal-¨  o    I    \scriptstyle M\ddot{o}\times I   , of the möbius strip and an interval    I  =   [  0  ,  1  ]       I   0  1     \scriptstyle I=[0,1]   . In this model one can see that the core central curve at 1/2 has a regular neighborhood which is again a trivial cartesian product      M   o  ¨    ×   [     1  2    -  ε   ,     1  2    +  ε   ]         M   normal-¨  o         1  2   ε       1  2   ε      \scriptstyle M\ddot{o}\times[\frac{1}{2}-\varepsilon,\frac{1}{2}+\varepsilon]   and whose boundary is a Klein bottle.
