Solid Klein bottle

In mathematics, a solid Klein bottle is a three-dimensional topological space (a 3-manifold) whose boundary is the Klein bottle.1
It is homeomorphic to the quotient space obtained by gluing the top disk of a cylinder

 
  to the bottom disk by a reflection across a diameter of the disk. 
Alternatively, one can visualize the solid Klein bottle as the trivial product

 
 , of the m√∂bius strip and an interval 
 
 
 
 . In this model one can see that the core central curve at 1/2 has a regular neighborhood which is again a trivial cartesian product

 
  and whose boundary is a Klein bottle.
