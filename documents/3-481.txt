   Lowest common denominator      Lowest common denominator   In mathematics , the lowest common denominator or least common denominator (abbreviated LCD ) is the least common multiple of the denominators of a set of fractions . It simplifies adding, subtracting, and comparing fractions.  Role in arithmetic and algebra  The same fraction can be expressed in many different forms. As long as the ratio between numerator and denominator is the same, the fractions represent the same number. For example:        2  3   =   6  9   =   12  18   =   144  216   =    200  ,  000    300  ,  000     .          2  3     6  9          12  18          144  216           200  000    300  000       \frac{2}{3}=\frac{6}{9}=\frac{12}{18}=\frac{144}{216}=\frac{200,000}{300,000}.     It's usually easiest to add, subtract, or compare fractions when each is expressed with the same denominator, called a "common denominator". For example, it's obvious that      5  12   +   6  12    =   11  12           5  12     6  12      11  12     \frac{5}{12}+\frac{6}{12}=\frac{11}{12}   and that     5  12   <   11  12         5  12     11  12     \frac{5}{12}<\frac{11}{12}   , since each fraction has the common denominator 12. But it's not obvious what     5  12   +   11  18         5  12     11  18     \frac{5}{12}+\frac{11}{18}   equals, or whether    5  12      5  12    \frac{5}{12}   is greater than or less than    11  18      11  18    \frac{11}{18}   , because the denominators are different. Any common denominator will do, but usually the least common denominator is desirable because it makes the rest of the calculation as simple as possible. 1  The least common denominator of a set of fractions is the least number that is a multiple of all the denominators: their "least common multiple". The product of the denominators is always a common denominator, as in:        1  2   +    2  3     =    3  6   +    4  6     =   7  6             1  2     2  3        3  6     4  6           7  6      \frac{1}{2}+\frac{2}{3}\;=\;\frac{3}{6}+\frac{4}{6}\;=\;\frac{7}{6}     but it's not always the least common denominator, as in:        5  12   +    11  18     =    15  36   +    22  36     =   37  36             5  12     11  18        15  36     22  36           37  36      \frac{5}{12}+\frac{11}{18}\;=\;\frac{15}{36}+\frac{22}{36}\;=\;\frac{37}{36}     Here, 36 is the least common multiple of 12 and 18. Their product, 216, is also a common denominator, but calculating with that denominator involves larger numbers      5  12   +   11  18    =    90  216   +   132  216    =   222  216             5  12     11  18        90  216     132  216           222  216      \frac{5}{12}+\frac{11}{18}=\frac{90}{216}+\frac{132}{216}=\frac{222}{216}   .  With variables rather than numbers, the same principles apply: 2        a   b  c    +    c    b  2   d      =     a  b  d     b  2   c  d    +     c  2     b  2   c  d      =     a  b  d   +   c  2      b  2   c  d              a    b  c      c     superscript  b  2   d           a  b  d      superscript  b  2   c  d       superscript  c  2      superscript  b  2   c  d                a  b  d    superscript  c  2       superscript  b  2   c  d       \frac{a}{bc}+\frac{c}{b^{2}d}\;=\;\frac{abd}{b^{2}cd}+\frac{c^{2}}{b^{2}cd}\;=%
