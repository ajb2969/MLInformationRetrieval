   Specific kinetic energy      Specific kinetic energy   Specific kinetic energy is kinetic energy of an object per unit of mass.  It is defined as         e  k   =   1  2        v  2            subscript  e  k     1  2       superscript  v  2     \begin{matrix}e_{k}=\frac{1}{2}\end{matrix}v^{2}   .  Where    e  k     subscript  e  k    e_{k}   is the specific kinetic energy and   v   v   v   is velocity. It has units of J/kg, which is equivalent to m 2 /s 2 .  "  Category:Energy (physics)
