   4-hydroxymandelate oxidase      4-hydroxymandelate oxidase   In enzymology , a 4-hydroxymandelate oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxybenzaldehyde + CO 2 + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetate and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 4-hydroxybenzaldehyde , CO 2 , and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxyphenyl)acetate:oxygen 1-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called L-4-hydroxymandelate oxidase (decarboxylating) . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Manganese .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.3  Category:Flavin enzymes  Category:Manganese enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
