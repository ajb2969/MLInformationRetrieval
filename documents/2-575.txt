   Advection      Advection   In physics , engineering , and earth sciences , advection is a transport mechanism of a substance or conserved property by a fluid due to the fluid's bulk motion . An example of advection is the transport of pollutants or silt in a river by bulk water flow downstream. Another commonly advected quantity is energy or enthalpy . Here the fluid may be any material that contains thermal energy, such as water or air . In general, any substance or conserved, extensive quantity can be advected by a fluid that can hold or contain the quantity or substance.  In advection, a fluid transports some conserved quantity or material via bulk motion. The fluid's motion is described mathematically as a vector field , and the transported material is described by a scalar field showing its distribution over space. Advection requires currents in the fluid, and so cannot happen in rigid solids. It does not include transport of substances by molecular diffusion .  Advection is sometimes confused with the more encompassing process of convection which is the combination of advective transport and diffusive transport.  In meteorology and physical oceanography , advection often refers to the transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean , such as heat , humidity (see moisture ) or salinity .  Advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds and the precipitation of water from clouds, as part of the hydrological cycle .  Distinction between advection and convection  The term advection sometimes serves as a synonym for convection , but technically, convection covers the sum of transport both by diffusion and by advection. Advective transport describes the movement of some quantity via the bulk flow of a fluid (as in a river or pipeline). 1 2  Meteorology  In meteorology and physical oceanography , advection often refers to the horizontal transport of some property of the atmosphere or ocean , such as heat , humidity or salinity, and convection generally refers to vertical transport (vertical advection). Advection is important for the formation of orographic clouds (terrain-forced convection) and the precipitation of water from clouds, as part of the hydrological cycle .  Other quantities  The advection equation also applies if the quantity being advected is represented by a probability density function at each point, although accounting for diffusion is more difficult.  Mathematics of advection  The advection equation is the partial differential equation that governs the motion of a conserved scalar field as it is advected by a known velocity vector field . It is derived using the scalar field's conservation law , together with Gauss's theorem , and taking the infinitesimal limit.  One easily visualized example of advection is the transport of ink dumped into a river. As the river flows, ink will move downstream in a "pulse" via advection, as the water's movement itself transports the ink. If added to a lake without significant bulk water flow, the ink would simply disperse outwards from its source in a diffusive manner, which is not advection. Note that as it moves downstream, the "pulse" of ink will also spread via diffusion. The sum of these processes is called convection .  The advection equation  In Cartesian coordinates the advection operator is       𝐮  ⋅  ∇   =     u  x    ∂   ∂  x     +    u  y    ∂   ∂  y     +    u  z    ∂   ∂  z           normal-⋅  𝐮  normal-∇        subscript  u  x        x        subscript  u  y        y        subscript  u  z        z        \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla=u_{x}\frac{\partial}{\partial x}+u_{y}\frac{\partial}{%
 \partial y}+u_{z}\frac{\partial}{\partial z}   .  where u = ( u x , u y , u z ) is the velocity field , and ∇ is the del operator (note that Cartesian coordinates are used here).  The advection equation for a conserved quantity described by a scalar field  ψ is expressed mathematically by a continuity equation :  where ∇∙ is the divergence operator and again u is the velocity vector field . Frequently, it is assumed that the flow is incompressible , that is, the velocity field satisfies       ∇  ⋅  𝕦   =  0       normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝕦   0    \nabla\cdot{\mathbb{u}}=0     and u is said to be solenoidal . If this is so, the above equation can be rewritten as      In particular, if the flow is steady, then       𝕦  ⋅   ∇  ψ    =  0       normal-⋅  𝕦   normal-∇  ψ    0    {\mathbb{u}}\cdot\nabla\psi=0     which shows that ψ is constant along a streamline . Hence,       ∂  ψ   /   ∂  t    =  0   ,          ψ     t    0    \partial\psi/\partial t=0,   so ψ doesn't vary in time.  If a vector quantity a (such as a magnetic field ) is being advected by the solenoidal  velocity field  u , the advection equation above becomes:         ∂  𝕒    ∂  t    +    (   𝕦  ⋅  ∇   )   𝕒    =  0.            𝕒     t       normal-⋅  𝕦  normal-∇   𝕒    0.    \frac{\partial{\mathbb{a}}}{\partial t}+\left({\mathbb{u}}\cdot\nabla\right){%
 \mathbb{a}}=0.     Here, a is a vector field instead of the scalar field  ψ .  Solving the equation  The advection equation is not simple to solve numerically : the system is a hyperbolic partial differential equation , and interest typically centers on discontinuous "shock" solutions (which are notoriously difficult for numerical schemes to handle).  Even with one space dimension and a constant velocity field , the system remains difficult to simulate. The equation becomes         ∂  ψ    ∂  t    +    u  x     ∂  ψ    ∂  x      =  0            ψ     t       subscript  u  x       ψ     x      0    \frac{\partial\psi}{\partial t}+u_{x}\frac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}=0     where ψ = ψ ( x , t ) is the scalar field being advected and u x is the x component of the vector u = ( u x ,0,0).  Treatment of the advection operator in the incompressible Navier Stokes equations  According to Zang, 3 numerical simulation can be aided by considering the skew symmetric form for the advection operator.         1  2   𝕦   ⋅   ∇  𝕦    +    1  2    ∇   (   𝕦  𝕦   )          normal-⋅      1  2   𝕦    normal-∇  𝕦        1  2    normal-∇    𝕦  𝕦       \frac{1}{2}{\mathbb{u}}\cdot\nabla{\mathbb{u}}+\frac{1}{2}\nabla({\mathbb{u}}{%
 \mathbb{u}})     where       ∇   (   𝕦  𝕦   )    =   [   ∇   (   𝕦   u  x    )    ,   ∇   (   𝕦   u  y    )    ,   ∇   (   𝕦   u  z    )    ]        normal-∇    𝕦  𝕦      normal-∇    𝕦   subscript  u  x      normal-∇    𝕦   subscript  u  y      normal-∇    𝕦   subscript  u  z        \nabla({\mathbb{u}}{\mathbb{u}})=[\nabla({\mathbb{u}}u_{x}),\nabla({\mathbb{u}%
 }u_{y}),\nabla({\mathbb{u}}u_{z})]     and u is the same as above.  Since skew symmetry implies only imaginary  eigenvalues , this form reduces the "blow up" and "spectral blocking" often experienced in numerical solutions with sharp discontinuities (see Boyd 4 ).  Using vector calculus identities , these operators can also be expressed in other ways, available in more software packages for more coordinate systems.       𝐮  ⋅   ∇  𝐮    =    ∇   (     ∥  𝐮  ∥   2   2   )    +    (   ∇  ×  𝐮   )   ×  𝐮         normal-⋅  𝐮   normal-∇  𝐮       normal-∇     superscript   norm  𝐮   2   2        normal-∇  𝐮   𝐮      \mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}=\nabla\left(\frac{\|\mathbf{u}\|^{2}}{2}\right%
 )+\left(\nabla\times\mathbf{u}\right)\times\mathbf{u}             1  2   𝐮   ⋅   ∇  𝐮    +    1  2    ∇   (  𝐮𝐮  )      =    ∇   (     ∥  𝐮  ∥   2   2   )    +    (   ∇  ×  𝐮   )   ×  𝐮   +    1  2   𝐮   (   ∇  ⋅  𝐮   )            normal-⋅      1  2   𝐮    normal-∇  𝐮        1  2    normal-∇  𝐮𝐮        normal-∇     superscript   norm  𝐮   2   2        normal-∇  𝐮   𝐮       1  2   𝐮   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝐮       \frac{1}{2}\mathbf{u}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{u}+\frac{1}{2}\nabla(\mathbf{u}\mathbf%
 {u})=\nabla\left(\frac{\|\mathbf{u}\|^{2}}{2}\right)+\left(\nabla\times\mathbf%
 {u}\right)\times\mathbf{u}+\frac{1}{2}\mathbf{u}(\nabla\cdot\mathbf{u})     This form also makes visible that the skew symmetric operator introduces error when the velocity field diverges. Solving the advection equation by numerical methods is very challenging and there is a large scientific literature about this.
