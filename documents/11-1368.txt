   Sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 2-alpha-galactosyltransferase      Sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 2-alpha-galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 2-alpha-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 2-(alpha-D-galactosyl)-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and sn-glycerol 3-phosphate , whereas its two products are UDP and 2-(alpha-D-galactosyl)-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate 2-alpha-D-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include floridoside-phosphate synthase , UDP-galactose:sn-glycerol-3-phosphate-2-D-galactosyl transferase , FPS , UDP-galactose, sn-3-glycerol phosphate:1->2' galactosyltransferase , floridoside phosphate synthetase , and floridoside phosphate synthase .
