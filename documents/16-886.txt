   Nilpotent space      Nilpotent space   In topology, a branch of mathematics, a nilpotent space is a based topological space  X such that the fundamental group    π  =    π  1   X       π     subscript  π  1   X     \pi=\pi_{1}X   is a nilpotent group and   π   π   \pi   acts nilpotently on higher homotopy groups       π  i   X   ,  i   ≥  2          subscript  π  i   X   i   2    \pi_{i}X,i\geq 2   . 1 A simply connected space and a simple space are (trivial) examples of nilpotent spaces.
