Nilpotent space

In topology, a branch of mathematics, a nilpotent space is a based topological space X such that the fundamental group 
 
 
 
  is a nilpotent group and 
 
 
 
  acts nilpotently on higher homotopy groups 
 
 
 
 .1 A simply connected space and a simple space are (trivial) examples of nilpotent spaces.
