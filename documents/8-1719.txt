Nice name

In set theory, a nice name is used in forcing to impose an upper bound on the number of subsets in the generic model. It is used in the context of forcing to prove independence results in set theory such as Easton's theorem.
Formal definition
Let 
 
 
 
  ZFC be transitive, 
 
 
 
  a forcing notion in 
 
 
 
 , and suppose 
 
 
 
  is generic over 
 
 
 
 . Then for any 
 
 
 
 -name in 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  is a nice name for a subset of 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -name satisfying the following properties:
(1) 
 
 

(2) For all 
 
 
 
 -names 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  forms an antichain.
(3) (Natural addition): If 
 
 
 
 , then there exists 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  such that
