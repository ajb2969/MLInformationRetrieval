   DTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase      DTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase   In enzymology , a dTDP-4-dehydrorhamnose reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dTDP-6-deoxy-L-mannose + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-L-mannose + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dTDP-6-deoxy-L-mannose and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are dTDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-L-mannose , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dTDP-6-deoxy-L-mannose:NADP + 4-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include dTDP-4-keto-L-rhamnose reductase , reductase, thymidine diphospho-4-ketorhamnose , dTDP-4-ketorhamnose reductase , TDP-4-keto-rhamnose reductase , and thymidine diphospho-4-ketorhamnose reductase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : nucleotide sugars metabolism , streptomycin biosynthesis , and polyketide sugar unit biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
