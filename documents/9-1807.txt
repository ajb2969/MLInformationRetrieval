   Harmonic measure      Harmonic measure  In [[mathematics]], especially [[potential theory]], '''harmonic measure''' is a concept related to the theory of [[harmonic function]]s that arise s from the solution of the classical Dirichlet problem .  In probability theory , harmonic measure of a subset of the boundary of a bounded domain in Euclidean space     R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   ,    n  ≥  2      n  2    n\geq 2   is the probability that a Brownian motion started inside a domain hits that subset of the boundary. More generally, harmonic measure of an Itō diffusion  X describes the distribution of X as it hits the boundary of D . In the complex plane , harmonic measure can be used to estimate the modulus of an analytic function inside a domain D given bounds on the modulus on the boundary of the domain; a special case of this principle is Hadamard's three-circle theorem . On simply connected planar domains, there is a close connection between harmonic measure and the theory of conformal maps .  The term harmonic measure was introduced by Rolf Nevanlinna in 1928 for planar domains, 1 2 although Nevanlinna notes the idea appeared implicitly in earlier work by Johansson, F. Riesz, M. Riesz, Carleman, Ostrowski and Julia (original order cited). The connection between harmonic measure and Brownian motion was first identified by Kakutani ten years later in 1944. 3  Definition  Let D be a bounded , open domain in n - dimensional  Euclidean space  R n , n ≥ 2, and let ∂ D denote the boundary of D . Any continuous function  f : ∂ D → R determines a unique harmonic function  H f that solves the Dirichlet problem      {        -   Δ   H  f    (  x  )     =  0   ,       x  ∈  D   ;           H  f    (  x  )    =   f   (  x  )     ,       x  ∈   ∂  D    .         cases        normal-Δ   subscript  H  f   x    0     x  D        subscript  H  f   x     f  x      x    D      \begin{cases}-\Delta H_{f}(x)=0,&x\in D;\\
 H_{f}(x)=f(x),&x\in\partial D.\end{cases}     If a point x ∈ D is fixed, by the Riesz representation theorem and the maximum principle  H f ( x ) determines a probability measure  ω ( x , D ) on ∂ D by         H  f    (  x  )    =    ∫   ∂  D     f   (  y  )   d  ω   (  x  ,  D  )    (  y  )      .         subscript  H  f   x     subscript     D      f  y  normal-d  ω   x  D   y      H_{f}(x)=\int_{\partial D}f(y)\,\mathrm{d}\omega(x,D)(y).     The measure ω ( x , D ) is called the harmonic measure (of the domain D with pole at x ).  Properties   For any Borel subset E of ∂ D , the harmonic measure ω ( x , D )( E ) is equal to the value at x of the solution to the Dirichlet problem with boundary data equal to the indicator function of E .    For fixed D and E ⊆ ∂ D , ω ( x , D )( E ) is an harmonic function of x ∈ D and          0  ≤   ω   (  x  ,  D  )    (  E  )    ≤  1   ;        0    ω   x  D   E        1     0\leq\omega(x,D)(E)\leq 1;           1  -   ω   (  x  ,  D  )    (  E  )     =   ω   (  x  ,  D  )    (    ∂  D   ∖  E   )     ;        1    ω   x  D   E      ω   x  D       D   E      1-\omega(x,D)(E)=\omega(x,D)(\partial D\setminus E);         Hence, for each x and D , ω ( x , D ) is a probability measure on ∂ D .    If ω ( x , D )( E ) = 0 at even a single point x of D , then    y  ↦   ω   (  y  ,  D  )    (  E  )       maps-to  y    ω   y  D   E     y\mapsto\omega(y,D)(E)   is identically zero, in which case E is said to be a set of harmonic measure zero . This is a consequence of Harnack's inequality .   Since explicit formulas for harmonic measure are not typically available, we are interested in determining conditions which guarantee a set has harmonic measure zero.   F. and M.

Moreover, harmonic measure on D is mutually singular with respect to t -dimensional Hausdorff measure for all t > 1.

If   𝔻   𝔻   \mathbb{D}   is the unit disk and    X  ∈  𝔻      X  𝔻    X\in\mathbb{D}   , then     ω   (  X  ,  𝔻  )    (  E  )    =    ∫  E      1  -    |  X  |   2      |   X  -  Q   |   2      d   H  1    (  Q  )     2  π            ω   X  𝔻   E     subscript   E         1   superscript    X   2     superscript      X  Q    2        d   superscript  H  1   Q     2  π        \omega(X,\mathbb{D})(E)=\int_{E}\frac{1-|X|^{2}}{|X-Q|^{2}}\frac{dH^{1}(Q)}{2\pi}   for all    E  ⊂   S  1       E   superscript  S  1     E\subset S^{1}   where    H  1     superscript  H  1    H^{1}   denotes length measure on the unit circle.

If    D  ⊂   ℝ  2       D   superscript  ℝ  2     D\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}   is a simply connected planar domain bounded by a Jordan curve and X    ∈     \in    D , then     ω   (  X  ,  D  )    (  E  )    =     |    ϕ   -  1     (  E  )    |   /  2   π         ω   X  D   E            superscript  ϕ    1    E    2   π     \omega(X,D)(E)=|\phi^{-1}(E)|/2\pi   for all    E  ⊂   ∂  D       E    D     E\subset\partial D   where    ϕ  :   𝔻  →  D      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  𝔻  D     \phi:\mathbb{D}\rightarrow D   is the unique Riemann map which sends the origin to X , i.e.     ϕ   (  0  )    =  X        ϕ  0   X    \phi(0)=X   . See Carathéodory's theorem .    If    D  ⊂   ℝ  2       D   superscript  ℝ  2     D\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}   is the domain bounded by the Koch snowflake , then there exists a subset    E  ⊂   ∂  D       E    D     E\subset\partial D   of the Koch snowflake such that   E   E   E   has zero length (      H  1    (  E  )    =  0         superscript  H  1   E   0    H^{1}(E)=0   ) and full harmonic measure     ω   (  X  ,  D  )    (  E  )    =  1        ω   X  D   E   1    \omega(X,D)(E)=1   .   The harmonic measure of a diffusion  Consider an R n -valued Itō diffusion X starting at some point x in the interior of a domain D , with law P x . Suppose that one wishes to know the distribution of the points at which X exits D . For example, canonical Brownian motion B on the real line starting at 0 exits the interval (−1, +1) at −1 with probability ½ and at +1 with probability ½, so B τ (−1, +1) is uniformly distributed on the set {−1, +1}.  In general, if G is compactly embedded within R n , then the harmonic measure (or hitting distribution ) of X on the boundary ∂ G of G is the measure μ G x defined by       μ  G  x    (  F  )   =   𝐏  x    [   X   τ  G    ∈  F  ]      fragments   superscript   subscript  μ  G   x    fragments  normal-(  F  normal-)     superscript  𝐏  x    fragments  normal-[   subscript  X   subscript  τ  G     F  normal-]     \mu_{G}^{x}(F)=\mathbf{P}^{x}\big[X_{\tau_{G}}\in F\big]     for x ∈ G and F ⊆ ∂ G .  Returning to the earlier example of Brownian motion, one can show that if B is a Brownian motion in R n starting at x ∈ R n and D ⊂ R n is an open ball centred on x , then the harmonic measure of B on ∂ D is invariant under all rotations of D about x and coincides with the normalized surface measure on ∂ D  General references       (See Sections 7, 8 and 9)   References    External links     "  Category:Measures (measure theory)  Category:Potential theory     R.
