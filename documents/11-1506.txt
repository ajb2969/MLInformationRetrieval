   Glycerol-3-phosphate—glucose phosphotransferase      Glycerol-3-phosphate—glucose phosphotransferase   In enzymology , a glycerol-3-phosphate-glucose phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   sn-glycerol 3-phosphate + D-glucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerol + D-glucose 6-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and D-glucose , whereas its two products are glycerol and D-glucose 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sn-glycerol-3-phosphate:D-glucose 6-phosphotransferase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
