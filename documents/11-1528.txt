   Inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase      Inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase   In enzymology , an inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 1D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 1D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 1D-myo-inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate , whereas its two products are ADP and 1D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate .  This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : inositol phosphate metabolism , calcium signaling pathway , and phosphatidylinositol signaling system . This enzyme has at least one effector , Calcium .  Nomenclature  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:1D-myo-inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate 3-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include 1D-myo-inositol-trisphosphate 3-kinase, and Ins(1,4,5)P3 3-kinase.  References  Further reading       "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Enzymes of known structure
