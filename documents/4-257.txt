Compression (functional analysis)

In functional analysis, the compression of a linear operator T on a Hilbert space to a subspace K is the operator


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the orthogonal projection onto K. This is a natural way to obtain an operator on K from an operator on the whole Hilbert space. If K is an invariant subspace for T, then the compression of T to K is the restricted operator Kâ†’K sending k to Tk.
More generally, for a linear operator T on a Hilbert space 
 
 
 
  and an isometry V on a subspace 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , define the compression of T to 
 
 
 
  by


 
 ,
where 
 
 
 
  is the adjoint of V. If T is a self-adjoint operator, then the compression 
 
 
 
 
  is also self-adjoint. When V is replaced by the identity function

 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and we acquire the special definition above.
