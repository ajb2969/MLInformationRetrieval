   Compression (functional analysis)      Compression (functional analysis)   In functional analysis , the compression of a linear operator  T on a Hilbert space to a subspace  K is the operator          P  K   T   |   K   :   K  →  K      normal-:   evaluated-at     subscript  P  K   T   K    normal-→  K  K     P_{K}T|_{K}:K\rightarrow K   ,  where     P  K   :   H  →  K      normal-:   subscript  P  K    normal-→  H  K     P_{K}:H\rightarrow K   is the orthogonal projection onto K . This is a natural way to obtain an operator on K from an operator on the whole Hilbert space. If K is an invariant subspace for T , then the compression of T to K is the restricted operator K→K sending k to Tk .  More generally, for a linear operator T on a Hilbert space   H   H   H   and an isometry  V on a subspace   W   W   W   of   H   H   H   , define the compression of T to   W   W   W   by        T  W   =    V  *   T  V    :   W  →  W      normal-:     subscript  T  W      superscript  V    T  V     normal-→  W  W     T_{W}=V^{*}TV:W\rightarrow W   ,  where    V  *     superscript  V     V^{*}   is the adjoint of V . If T is a self-adjoint operator, then the compression    T  W     subscript  T  W    T_{W}   is also self-adjoint. When V is replaced by the identity function     I  :    W  -   >  H      normal-:  I     limit-from  W    H     I:W->H   ,      V  *   =   I  *   =   P  K    :    H  -   >  W      normal-:       superscript  V     superscript  I          subscript  P  K        limit-from  H    W     V^{*}=I^{*}=P_{K}:H->W   , and we acquire the special definition above.
