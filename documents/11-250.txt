   Taxadiene synthase      Taxadiene synthase   In enzymology , a taxadiene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   geranylgeranyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    taxa-4,11-diene + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , geranylgeranyl diphosphate , and two products , taxa-4,11-diene and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranylgeranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, taxa-4,11-diene-forming) . Other names in common use include geranylgeranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, , and taxadiene-forming) . This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis .
