   Iitaka dimension      Iitaka dimension   In algebraic geometry , the Iitaka dimension of a line bundle  L on an algebraic variety  X is the dimension of the image of the rational map to projective space determined by L . This is 1 less than the dimension of the section ring of L        R   (  X  ,  L  )    =    ⊕   d  =  0   ∞     H  0    (  X  ,   L    ⊗  d    )      .        R   X  L      superscript   subscript  direct-sum    d  0         superscript  H  0    X   superscript  L   tensor-product  absent  d         R(X,L)=\bigoplus_{d=0}^{\infty}H^{0}(X,L^{\otimes d}).   The Iitaka dimension of L is always less than or equal to the dimension of X . If L is not effective, then its Iitaka dimension is usually defined to be    -  ∞         -\infty   or simply said to be negative (some early references define it to be −1). The Iitaka dimension of L is sometimes called L-dimension, while the dimension of a divisor D is called D-dimension. The Iitaka dimension was introduced by .  Big line bundles  A line bundle is big if it is of maximal Iitaka dimension, that is, if its Iitaka dimension is equal to the dimension of the underlying variety. Bigness is a birational invariant: If  is a birational morphism of varieties, and if L is a big line bundle on X , then f * L is a big line bundle on Y .  All ample line bundles are big.  Big line bundles need not determine birational isomorphisms of X with its image. For example, if C is a hyperelliptic curve (such as a curve of genus two), then its canonical bundle is big, but the rational map it determines is not a birational isomorphism. Instead, it is a two-to-one cover of the canonical curve of C , which is a rational normal curve .  Kodaira dimension  The Iitaka dimension of the canonical bundle of a smooth variety is called its Kodaira dimension .  Iitaka conjecture  (Figure)  The m-pluricanonical map of complex manifolds M to W induces a fiber space structure.   Consider on complex algebraic varieties in the following.  Let K be the canonical bundle on M. The dimension of H 0 (M,K m ), holomorphic sections of K m , is denoted by P m (M), called m-genus . Let          N   (  M  )    =   {   m  ≥  1   |     P  m    (  M  )    ≥  1   }    ,        N  M    conditional-set    m  1        subscript  P  m   M   1      N(M)=\{m\geq 1|P_{m}(M)\geq 1\},        then N(M) becomes to be all of the positive integer with non-zero m-genus. When N(M) is not empty, for    m  ∈   N   (  M  )        m    N  M     m\in N(M)    m-pluricanonical map     Φ   m  K      subscript  normal-Φ    m  K     \Phi_{mK}   is defined as the map       Φ   m  K    :      normal-:   subscript  normal-Φ    m  K    absent    \displaystyle\Phi_{mK}:   where    φ  i     subscript  φ  i    \varphi_{i}   are the bases of H 0 (M,K m ). Then the image of    Φ   m  K      subscript  normal-Φ    m  K     \Phi_{mK}   ,     Φ   m  K     (  M  )        subscript  normal-Φ    m  K    M    \Phi_{mK}(M)   is defined as the submanifold of    ℙ  N     superscript  ℙ  N    \mathbb{P}^{N}   .  For certain   m   m   m   let     Φ   m  k    :   M  →  W  =    Φ   m  K     (  M  )    ⊂   ℙ  N       normal-:   subscript  normal-Φ    m  k       normal-→  M  W          subscript  normal-Φ    m  K    M         superscript  ℙ  N       \Phi_{mk}:M\rightarrow W=\Phi_{mK}(M)\subset\mathbb{P}^{N}   be the m-pluricanonical map where W is the complex manifold embedded into projective space P N .  In the case of surfaces with κ(M)=1 the above W is replaced by a curve C, which is an elliptic curve (κ(C)=0). We want to extend this fact to the general dimension and obtain the analytic fiber structure depicted in the upper right figure.  (Figure)  The m-pluricanonical map is birational invariant. P m (M)=P m (W)   Given a birational map    φ  :   M  ⟶  W      normal-:  φ   normal-⟶  M  W     \varphi:M\longrightarrow W   , m-pluricanonical map brings the commutative diagram depicted in the left figure, which means that      Φ   m  K     (  M  )    =    Φ   m  K     (  W  )           subscript  normal-Φ    m  K    M      subscript  normal-Φ    m  K    W     \Phi_{mK}(M)=\Phi_{mK}(W)   , i.e. m-pluricanonical genus is birationally invariant.  (Figure)  The existence of the birational map ψ : W m1 → W m2 in the projective space   It is shown by Iitaka that given n-dimensional compact complex manifold M with its Kodaira dimension κ(M) satisfying 1 ≤ κ(M) ≤ n-1, there are enough large m 1 , m 2 such that     Φ    m  1   K    :   M  ⟶    W   m  1     (  M  )        normal-:   subscript  normal-Φ     subscript  m  1   K     normal-⟶  M     subscript  W   subscript  m  1    M      \Phi_{m_{1}K}:M\longrightarrow W_{m_{1}}(M)   and     Φ    m  2   K    :   M  ⟶    W   m  2     (  M  )        normal-:   subscript  normal-Φ     subscript  m  2   K     normal-⟶  M     subscript  W   subscript  m  2    M      \Phi_{m_{2}K}:M\longrightarrow W_{m_{2}}(M)   are birationally equivalent, which means there are the birational map    φ  :    W   m  1    ⟶    W   m  2     (  M  )        normal-:  φ   normal-⟶   subscript  W   subscript  m  1       subscript  W   subscript  m  2    M      \varphi:W_{m_{1}}\longrightarrow W_{m_{2}}(M)   . Namely, the diagram depicted in the right figure is commutative.  Furthermore, one can select    M  *     superscript  M     M^{*}   that is birational with   M   M   M   and    W  *     superscript  W     W^{*}   that is birational with both    W   m  1      subscript  W   subscript  m  1     W_{m_{1}}   and    W   m  1      subscript  W   subscript  m  1     W_{m_{1}}   such that        Φ  :    M  *   ⟶   W  *       normal-:  normal-Φ   normal-⟶   superscript  M     superscript  W       \Phi:M^{*}\longrightarrow W^{*}        is birational map, the fibers of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   are simply connected and the general fibers of   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi              M  w  *    Φ   -  1     (  w  )    ,  w   ∈   W  *           subscript   superscript  M    w    superscript  normal-Φ    1    w   w    superscript  W      M^{*}_{w}\Phi^{-1}(w),\ \ w\in W^{*}        have Kodaira dimension 0.  The above fiber structure is called the Iitaka fiber space. In the case of the surface S ( n = 2 = dim(S)), W * is the algebraic curve, the fiber structure is of dimension 1, and then the general fibers have the Kodaira dimension 0 i.e. elliptic curve. Therefore, S is the elliptic surface. These fact can be generalized to the general n . Therefore The study of the higher-dimensional birational geometry decompose to the part of κ=-∞,0,n and the fiber space whose fibers is of κ=0.  The following additional formula by Iitaka, called Iitaka conjecture , is important for the classification of algebraic varieties or compact complex manifolds.  This conjecture has been only partly solved, for example in the case of Moishezon manifolds . The classification theory might been said to be the effort to solve the Iitaka conjecture and lead another theorems that the three-dimensional variety V is abelian if and only if κ(V)=0 and q(V)=3 and its generalization so on. The minimal model program might be led from this conjecture.  References       "  Category:Birational geometry  Category:Vector bundles
