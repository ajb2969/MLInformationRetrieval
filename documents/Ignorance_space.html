<h1>Ignorance space</h1>
<hr/>
<p>The <strong>ignorance space</strong> is the first component of the <a href="Bernoulli_space" title="wikilink">Bernoulli space</a> which constitutes the stochastic model within <a href="Bernoulli_stochastics" title="wikilink">Bernoulli stochastics</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> Ignorance means lack of <a class="uri" href="knowledge" title="wikilink">knowledge</a> about facts. Since Bernoulli Stochastics is a mathematical science, the facts refer to characteristics that are quantified by variables, and each fact is therefore represented by a unique real number. Because the considered variable has a fixed, i.e., determinate value, the variable is called deterministic variable denoted <em>D</em>. For example, consider a given object and let the characteristic of interest be the mass of the object. Then the deterministic variable <em>D</em> stands for mass which is quantified by the unit <em>kilogram</em> and for the object at hand <em>D</em> is fixed by a real number.</p>
<h2 id="ignorance-knowledge-and-truth">Ignorance, knowledge and truth</h2>
<p>In the above example the mass of the object is fixed and the corresponding real number, say <span class="LaTeX">$d_0$</span> specifies the value of <em>D</em> <em>kilogram</em>. The real number <span class="LaTeX">$d_0$</span> constitutes the truth about the mass of the object. However, human beings are not able to determine the truth given by <span class="LaTeX">$d_0$</span>, since whatever measurement device is used, the measurement process is subject to randomness and the determination of the true value <span class="LaTeX">$d_0$</span> of the deterministic variable <em>D</em> is in principle impossible.</p>
<p>It follows that human beings in general cannot know "what is", for example, the true value <span class="LaTeX">$d_0$</span>. But, they can, of course know "what is not" since any weighing device yields a more or less small set <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{D}_0$</span> which contains the true but unknown value <span class="LaTeX">$d_0$</span>. Thus human knowledge generally refers to "what is not" namely all numbers which are not contained in <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{D}_0$</span>, but it remains unknown which of the elements of <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{D}_0$</span> is the true one.</p>
<p>Thus, human ignorance refers to truth, i.e., "what is", while human knowledge refers "what is not". The set <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{D}_0$</span> describes therefore the state of ignorance about the true value <span class="LaTeX">$d_0$</span> of the deterministic variable <em>D</em>. Therefore the set <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{D}_0$</span> is called ignorance space of <em>D</em> denoted <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{D}$</span>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="learning-and-ignorance-space">Learning and ignorance space</h2>
<p>Any reduction of an ignorance space <span class="LaTeX">$\mathfrak{D}$</span> represents the result of a learning process. In order to obtain a quantified description of a learning process, the ignorance space must be specified before the learning process is performed. Moreover, for judging the achieved result of a learning process, the hopefully reduced ignorance space must be given.</p>
<p>Whenever the truth is given by a real number, say <span class="LaTeX">$d_0$</span> then a learning process is generally called measurement procedure or in case that it is based on a Bernoulli Space it is called <a href="stochastic_measurement_procedure" title="wikilink">stochastic measurement procedure</a>. Measurement and learning are probably the most important activities of mankind and it is therefor of utmost importance that measurement and learning are performed in a rational and effective way in order to avoid or at least reduce waste of resources.</p>
