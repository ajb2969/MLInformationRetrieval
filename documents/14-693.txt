Downlink CNR

Downlink CNR (Carrier to noise ratio in satellite reception) is an important figure in system TVRO design. Below are certain parameters used in CNR computation.
Figure of merit
Figure of merit is given as


 
  Where t is the temperature and g is the gain of the receiver antenna. For lossless case


 
  and


 
  where n is the noise factor, ta is the noise temperature of the antenna and t0 is the temperature of the envirıonment (taken as 2900K). F in db is simply



Path loss
Path loss is defined as



Where 
 
 
 
  is the wavelength of the carrier and the d is the distance in meters between the satellite and the receiver . For Geosynchronous satellites this distance is  at the projection on the earth (at the mean sea level). In actual cases the distance is slightly more than this figure depending on the geographic location. (But for geosynchronous satellites the variation is less than 1%). The Path loss in dB is


 
  The same relation can be given in terms of frequency.



Where c is the velocity of light.
With metric units


 
  Using km for d and GHz for f


 
  Using miles for d and GHz for f

EIRP
Pe is the Equivalent isotropically radiated power (also known as EIRP) in dBW. It depends on the output of the transponders of the satellite and the antenna gain of the transmitting antenna. This figure is given by the service provider.



where p is the output power of the transponder and g is the antenna gain.
Baseband
B is the baseband of the channel given in dB


 
  Where b is the base band given in metric units (Hz).
When b is given in MHz, than



Boltzmann's constant
K is the Boltzmann constant given in dB units.
