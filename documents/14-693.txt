   Downlink CNR      Downlink CNR   Downlink CNR (Carrier to noise ratio in satellite reception) is an important figure in system TVRO design. Below are certain parameters used in CNR computation.  Figure of merit  Figure of merit is given as      f  =   g  t       f    g  t     f=\frac{g}{t}   Where t is the temperature and g is the gain of the receiver antenna. For lossless case      t  =    t  a   +    (   n  -  1   )   ⋅   t  0         t     subscript  t  a    normal-⋅    n  1    subscript  t  0       t=t_{a}+(n-1)\cdot t_{0}   and      f  =   g    t  a   +    (   n  -  1   )   ⋅   t  0          f    g     subscript  t  a    normal-⋅    n  1    subscript  t  0        f=\frac{g}{t_{a}+(n-1)\cdot t_{0}}   where n is the noise factor , t a is the noise temperature of the antenna and t 0 is the temperature of the envirıonment (taken as 290 0 K). F in db is simply      F  =    10     log  10    (  f  )         F    10    subscript   10   f      F=10\ \log_{10}(f)     Path loss  Path loss is defined as      l  =    (    4  ⋅  π  ⋅  d   λ   )   2       l   superscript     normal-⋅  4  π  d   λ   2     l=(\frac{4\cdot\pi\cdot d}{\lambda})^{2}     Where   λ   λ   \lambda   is the wavelength of the carrier and the d is the distance in meters between the satellite and the receiver . For Geosynchronous satellites this distance is  at the projection on the earth (at the mean sea level). In actual cases the distance is slightly more than this figure depending on the geographic location. (But for geosynchronous satellites the variation is less than 1%). The Path loss in dB is      L  =    20     log  10    (    4  ⋅  π  ⋅  d   λ   )         L    20    subscript   10      normal-⋅  4  π  d   λ       L=20\ \log_{10}\left(\frac{4\cdot\pi\cdot d}{\lambda}\right)   The same relation can be given in terms of frequency.      L  =    20     log  10    (    4  ⋅  π  ⋅  d  ⋅  f   c   )         L    20    subscript   10      normal-⋅  4  π  d  f   c       L=20\ \log_{10}\left(\frac{4\cdot\pi\cdot d\cdot f}{c}\right)     Where c is the velocity of light.  With metric units      L  =    -  147.56   +    20     log  10    (  d  )     +    20     log  10    (  f  )          L      147.56     20    subscript   10   d      20    subscript   10   f       L=-147.56+20\ \log_{10}(d)+20\ \log_{10}(f)   Using km for d and GHz for f      L  =   92.45  +    20     log  10    (  d  )     +    20     log  10    (  f  )          L    92.45    20    subscript   10   d      20    subscript   10   f       L=92.45+20\ \log_{10}(d)+20\ \log_{10}(f)   Using miles for d and GHz for f      L  =   96.58  +    20     log  10    (  d  )     +    20     log  10    (  f  )          L    96.58    20    subscript   10   d      20    subscript   10   f       L=96.58+20\ \log_{10}(d)+20\ \log_{10}(f)    1 2  EIRP  P e is the Equivalent isotropically radiated power (also known as EIRP) in dBW. It depends on the output of the transponders of the satellite and the antenna gain of the transmitting antenna. This figure is given by the service provider.       P  e   =     10     log  10    (  p  )     +    10     log  10    (   g  t   )           subscript  P  e       10    subscript   10   p      10    subscript   10    subscript  g  t        P_{e}=10\ \log_{10}(p)+10\ \log_{10}(g_{t})     where p is the output power of the transponder and g is the antenna gain.
