   Sampling fraction      Sampling fraction   In sampling theory , sampling fraction is the ratio of sample size to population size or, in the context of stratified sampling , the ratio of the sample size to the size of the stratum. 1 The formula for the sampling fraction is       f  =   n  N    ,      f    n  N     f=\frac{n}{N},   where n is the sample size and N is the population size. If the sampling fraction is less than 5% or 0.05, then the finite population multiplier might be ignored.  References    "  Category:Sampling (statistics)  Category:Statistical ratios     â†©
