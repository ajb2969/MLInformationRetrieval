   Minkowski distance      Minkowski distance   The Minkowski distance is a metric in a normed vector space which can be considered as a generalization of both the Euclidean distance and the Manhattan distance .  Definition  The Minkowski distance of order p between two points      X  =    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )   and  Y   =   (   y  1   ,   y  2   ,  …  ,   y  n   )   ∈   ℝ  n         X      subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n    and  Y          subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2   normal-…   subscript  y  n          superscript  ℝ  n      X=(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n})\text{ and }Y=(y_{1},y_{2},\ldots,y_{n})\in\mathbb%
 {R}^{n}     is defined as:       (    ∑   i  =  1   n     |    x  i   -   y  i    |   p    )    1  /  p      superscript    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript       subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i     p      1  p     \left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|^{p}\right)^{1/p}     For    p  ≥  1      p  1    p\geq 1   , the Minkowski distance is a metric as a result of the Minkowski inequality . When    p  <  1      p  1    p<1   , the distance between (0,0) and (1,1) is     2   1  /  p    >  2       superscript  2    1  p    2    2^{1/p}>2   , but the point (0,1) is at a distance 1 from both of these points. Since this violates the triangle inequality , for    p  <  1      p  1    p<1   it is not a metric.  Minkowski distance is typically used with p being 1 or 2. The latter is the Euclidean distance , while the former is sometimes known as the Manhattan distance . In the limiting case of p reaching infinity, we obtain the Chebyshev distance :         lim   p  →  ∞      (    ∑   i  =  1   n     |    x  i   -   y  i    |   p    )    1  p     =    max   i  =  1   n    |    x  i   -   y  i    |     .        subscript    normal-→  p      superscript    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript       subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i     p      1  p       superscript   subscript     i  1    n        subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i        \lim_{p\to\infty}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|^{p}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}}=%
 \max_{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|.\,     Similarly, for p reaching negative infinity, we have:         lim   p  →   -  ∞       (    ∑   i  =  1   n     |    x  i   -   y  i    |   p    )    1  p     =    min   i  =  1   n    |    x  i   -   y  i    |     .        subscript    normal-→  p         superscript    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript       subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i     p      1  p       superscript   subscript     i  1    n        subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i        \lim_{p\to-\infty}{\left(\sum_{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|^{p}\right)^{\frac{1}{p}}}%
 =\min_{i=1}^{n}|x_{i}-y_{i}|.\,     The Minkowski distance can also be viewed as a multiple of the power mean of the component-wise differences between P and Q .
