   Symplectic representation      Symplectic representation   In mathematical field of representation theory , a symplectic representation is a representation of a group or a Lie algebra on a symplectic vector space ( V , ω ) which preserves the symplectic form ω . Here ω is a nondegenerate skew symmetric bilinear form      ω  :    V  ×  V   →  𝔽      normal-:  ω   normal-→    V  V   𝔽     \omega\colon V\times V\to\mathbb{F}   where F is the field of scalars. A representation of a group G preserves ω if       ω   (   g  ⋅  v   ,   g  ⋅  w   )    =   ω   (  v  ,  w  )          ω    normal-⋅  g  v    normal-⋅  g  w       ω   v  w      \omega(g\cdot v,g\cdot w)=\omega(v,w)   for all g in G and v , w in V , whereas a representation of a Lie algebra  g preserves ω if        ω   (   ξ  ⋅  v   ,  w  )    +   ω   (  v  ,   ξ  ⋅  w   )     =  0          ω    normal-⋅  ξ  v   w      ω   v   normal-⋅  ξ  w      0    \omega(\xi\cdot v,w)+\omega(v,\xi\cdot w)=0   for all ξ in g and v , w in V . Thus a representation of G or g is equivalently a group or Lie algebra homomorphism from G or g to the symplectic group Sp( V , ω ) or its Lie algebra sp ( V , ω )  If G is a compact group (for example, a finite group ), and F is the field of complex numbers, then by introducing a compatible unitary structure (which exists by an averaging argument), one can show that any complex symplectic representation is a quaternionic representation . Quaternionic representations of finite or compact groups are often called symplectic representations, and may be identified using the Frobenius-Schur indicator .  References    .
