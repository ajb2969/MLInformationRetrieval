   Guanidinobutyrase      Guanidinobutyrase   In enzymology , a guanidinobutyrase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-guanidinobutanoate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-aminobutanoate + urea   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 4-guanidinobutanoate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are 4-aminobutanoate and urea .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amidines. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-guanidinobutanoate amidinohydrolase . Other names in common use include gamma-guanidobutyrase , 4-guanidinobutyrate amidinobutyrase , gamma-guanidinobutyrate amidinohydrolase , G-Base , GBH , and guanidinobutyrate ureahydrolase . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups . It employs one cofactor , manganese .
