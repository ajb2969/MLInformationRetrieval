Cavity perturbation theory

Cavity perturbation theory describes methods for derivation of perturbation formulae for performance changes of a cavity resonator. These performance changes are assumed to be caused by either introduction of a small foreign object into the cavity or a small deformation of its boundary.
General theory
When a resonant cavity is perturbed, i.e. when a foreign object with distinct material properties is introduced into the cavity or when a general shape of the cavity is changed, electromagnetic fields inside the cavity change accordingly. The underlying assumption of cavity perturbation theory is that electromagnetic fields inside the cavity after the change differ by a very small amount from the fields before the change. Then Maxwell's equations for original and perturbed cavities can be used to derive expressions for resulting resonant frequency shifts.
Material perturbation

When a material within a cavity is changed (permittivity and/or permeability), a corresponding change in resonant frequency can be approximated as:1
where 
 
 
 
  is the angular resonant frequency of the perturbed cavity, 
 
 
 
  is the resonant frequency of the original cavity, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent original electric and magnetic field respectively, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are original permeability and permittivity respectively, while 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are changes in original permeability and permittivity introduced by material change.
Expression () can be rewritten in terms of stored energies as:2
where W is the total energy stored in the original cavity and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are electric and magnetic energy densities respectively.
Shape perturbation

When a general shape of a resonant cavity is changed, a corresponding change in resonant frequency can be approximated as:3
Expression () for change in resonant frequency can additionally be written in terms of time-average stored energies as:4
where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent time-average electric and magnetic energies contained in 
 
 
 
 .
This expression can also be written in terms of energy densities 5 as:
Applications
Microwave measurement techniques based on cavity perturbation theory are generally used to determine the dielectric and magnetic parameters of materials and various circuit components such as dielectric resonators. Since ex-ante knowledge of the resonant frequency, resonant frequency shift and electromagnetic fields is necessary in order to extrapolate material properties, these measurement techniques generally make use of standard resonant cavities where resonant frequencies and electromagnetic fields are well known. Two examples of such standard resonant cavities are rectangular and circular waveguide cavities and coaxial cables resonators . Cavity perturbation measurement techniques for material characterization are used in many fields ranging from physics and material science to medicine and biology.67891011

For rectangular waveguide cavity, field distribution of dominant 

 mode is well known. Ideally, the material to be measured is introduced into the cavity at the position of maximum electric or magnetic field. When the material is introduced at the position of maximum electric field, then the contribution of magnetic field to perturbed frequency shift is very small and can be ignored. In this case, we can use perturbation theory to derive expressions for real and imaginary components of complex material permittivity

 
  as:12
where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent resonant frequencies of original cavity and perturbed cavity respectively, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent volumes of original cavity and material sample respectively, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent quality factors of original and perturbed cavities respectively.
Once the complex permittivity of the material is known, we can easily calculate its effective conductivity

 
  and dielectric loss tangent

 
  as:13 
where f is the frequency of interest and 
 
 
 
  is the free space permittivity.
Similarly, if the material is introduced into the cavity at the position of maximum magnetic field, then the contribution of electric field to perturbed frequency shift is very small and can be ignored. In this case, we can use perturbation theory to derive expressions for complex material permeability

 
  as:14
where 
 
 
 
  is the guide wavelength (calculated as 
 
 
 
 ).
