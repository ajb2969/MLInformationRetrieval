   Carry operator      Carry operator   The carry operator , symbolized by the ¢ sign, is an abstraction of the operation of determining whether a portion of an adder network generates or propagates a carry . It is defined as follows:      (   G  1   ,   P  1   )      subscript  G  1    subscript  P  1     (G_{1},P_{1})    ¢      (   G  2   ,   P  2   )   =   (    G  1    G  2    P  1    ,    P  2    P  1    )         subscript  G  2    subscript  P  2        subscript  G  1    subscript  G  2    subscript  P  1       subscript  P  2    subscript  P  1       (G_{2},P_{2})=(G_{1}G_{2}P_{1},P_{2}P_{1})     External links   http://www.aoki.ecei.tohoku.ac.jp/arith/mg/algorithm.html   "  Category:Computer arithmetic
