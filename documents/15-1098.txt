   3-Epi-6-deoxocathasterone 23-monooxygenase      3-Epi-6-deoxocathasterone 23-monooxygenase   3-Epi-6-deoxocathasterone 23-monooxygenase (, cytochrome P450 90C1 , CYP90D1 , CYP90C1 ) is an enzyme with system name 3-epi-6-deoxocathasterone,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (C-23-hydroxylating) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) 3-epi-6-deoxocathasterone + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-deoxotyphasterol + NADP + + H 2 O  (2) (22S,24R)-22-hydroxy-5alpha-ergostan-3-one + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-dehydro-6-deoxoteasterone + NADP + + H 2 O   3-Epi-6-deoxocathasterone 23-monooxygenase takes part in brassinosteroid biosynthesis.
