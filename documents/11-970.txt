   Plasmalogen synthase      Plasmalogen synthase   In enzymology , a plasmalogen synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + 1-O-alk-1-enyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + plasmenylcholine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and 1-O-alk-1-enyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine , whereas its two products are CoA and plasmenylcholine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:1-O-alk-1-enyl-glycero-3-phosphocholine 2-O-acyltransferase . Other names in common use include lysoplasmenylcholine acyltransferase , O-1-alkenylglycero-3-phosphorylcholine acyltransferase , and 1-alkenyl-glycero-3-phosphorylcholine:acyl-CoA acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
