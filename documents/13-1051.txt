Proofs related to chi-squared distribution

The following are proofs of several characteristics related to the chi-squared distribution.
Derivations of the pdf
Derivation of the pdf for one degree of freedom
Let random variable Y be defined as Y = X2 where X has normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 1 (that is X ~ N(0,1)).
Then,


Where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the cdf and pdf of the corresponding random variables.
Then 
 
 

Alternative proof using directly the change of variable formula
The change of variable formula (implicitely derived above), for a monotonic transformation y=g(x), is:



In this case the change is not monotonic, because every value of 
 
 
 
  has two corresponding values of 
 
 
 
  (one positive and negative). However, because of symmetry, both halves will transform identically, i.e.



In our case, the transformation is
 
 
 
 , and its derivative is 
 
 

So here:



And we get the chi-squared distribution, noting the property of the gamma function


Derivation of the pdf for two degrees of freedom
There are several methods to derive chi-squared distribution with 2 degrees of freedom. Here is one based on the distribution with 1 degree of freedom.
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two independent variables satisfying 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , so that the probability density functions of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are respectively:


 
  and



Simply, we can derive the joint distribution of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 :



where 
 
 
 
  is replaced by 
 
 
 
 . Further, let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , we can get that:


 
  and



or, inversely


 
  and



Since the two variable change policies are symmetric, we take the upper one and multiply the result by 2. The Jacobian determinant can be calculated as:



Now we can change 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 :



where the leading constant 2 is to take both the two variable change policies into account. Finally, we integrate out 
 
 
 
  to get the distribution of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
 :



Let 
 
 
 
 , the equation can be changed to:



So the result is:



Derivation of the pdf for k degrees of freedom
Consider the k samples 
 
 
 
  to represent a single point in a k-dimensional space. The chi square distribution for k degrees of freedom will then be given by:



where 
 
 
 
  is the standard normal distribution and 
 
 
 
  is that elemental shell volume at Q(x), which is proportional to the (k − 1)-dimensional surface in k-space for which



It can be seen that this surface is the surface of a k-dimensional ball or, alternatively, an n-sphere where n = k - 1 with radius 
 
 
 
 , and that the term in the exponent is simply expressed in terms of Q. Since it is a constant, it may be removed from inside the integral.



The integral is now simply the surface area A of the (k − 1)-sphere times the infinitesimal thickness of the sphere which is



The area of a (k − 1)-sphere is:



Substituting, realizing that 
 
 
 
 , and cancelling terms yields:
$$P(Q) \, dQ = \frac{e^{-Q/2}}{(2\pi)^{k/2}}A\,dR= \frac{1}{2^{k/2}\Gamma(k/2)}Q^{k/2-1}e^{-Q/2}\,dQ$$
