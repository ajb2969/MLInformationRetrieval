   Space form      Space form   In mathematics , a space form is a complete  Riemannian manifold  M of constant  sectional curvature  K . The three obvious examples are Euclidean n -space , the n -dimensional sphere , and hyperbolic space , although a space form need not be simply connected .  Reduction to generalized crystallography  The Killing–Hopf theorem of Riemannian geometry states that the universal cover of an n -dimensional space form    M  n     superscript  M  n    M^{n}   with curvature    K  =   -  1       K    1     K=-1   is isometric to    H  n     superscript  H  n    H^{n}   , hyperbolic space , with curvature    K  =  0      K  0    K=0   is isometric to    R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   , Euclidean n -space , and with curvature    K  =   +  1       K    1     K=+1   is isometric to    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   , the n-dimensional sphere of points distance 1 from the origin in    R   n  +  1      superscript  R    n  1     R^{n+1}   .  By rescaling the Riemannian metric on    H  n     superscript  H  n    H^{n}   , we may create a space    M  K     subscript  M  K    M_{K}   of constant curvature   K   K   K   for any    K  <  0      K  0    K<0   . Similarly, by rescaling the Riemannian metric on    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   , we may create a space    M  K     subscript  M  K    M_{K}   of constant curvature   K   K   K   for any    K  >  0      K  0    K>0   . Thus the universal cover of a space form   M   M   M   with constant curvature   K   K   K   is isometric to    M  K     subscript  M  K    M_{K}   .  This reduces the problem of studying space form to studying discrete  groups of isometries    Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   of    M  K     subscript  M  K    M_{K}   which act properly discontinuously . Note that the fundamental group of   M   M   M   ,     π  1    (  M  )        subscript  π  1   M    \pi_{1}(M)   , will be isomorphic to   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   . Groups acting in this manner on    R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   are called crystallographic groups . Groups acting in this manner on    H  2     superscript  H  2    H^{2}   and    H  3     superscript  H  3    H^{3}   are called Fuchsian groups and Kleinian groups , respectively.  Space form problem  The space form problem is a conjecture stating that any two compact  aspherical Riemannian manifolds with isomorphic  fundamental groups are homeomorphic .  The possible extensions are limited. One might wish to conjecture that the manifolds are isometric , but rescaling the Riemannian metric on a compact aspherical Riemannian manifold preserves the fundamental group and shows this to be false. One might also wish to conjecture that the manifolds are diffeomorphic , but John Milnor 's exotic spheres are all homeomorphic and hence have isomorphic fundamental group, showing this to be false.
