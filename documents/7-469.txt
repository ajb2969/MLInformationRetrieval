   Pseudospectrum      Pseudospectrum   In mathematics , the pseudospectrum of an operator is a set containing the spectrum of the operator and the numbers that are "almost" eigenvalues. Knowledge of the pseudospectrum can be particularly useful for understanding non-normal operators and their eigenfunctions.  The ε-pseudospectrum of a matrix A consists of all eigenvalues of matrices which are ε-close to A :         Λ  ϵ    (  A  )    =   {   λ  ∈  ℂ   ∣      ∃  x   ∈    ℂ  n   ∖   {  0  }     ,    ∃  E   ∈   ℂ   n  ×  n      :      (   A  +  E   )   x   =   λ  x    ,    ∥  E  ∥   ≤  ϵ     }    .         subscript  normal-Λ  ϵ   A    conditional-set    λ  ℂ    normal-:   formulae-sequence      x      superscript  ℂ  n    0         E    superscript  ℂ    n  n       formulae-sequence        A  E   x     λ  x       norm  E   ϵ        \Lambda_{\epsilon}(A)=\{\lambda\in\mathbb{C}\mid\exists x\in\mathbb{C}^{n}%

 \leq\epsilon\}.     Numerical algorithms which calculate the eigenvalues of a matrix give only approximate results due to rounding and other errors. These errors can be described with the matrix E .  References   Pseudospectra Gateway / Embree and Trefethen 1   "  Category:Numerical linear algebra
