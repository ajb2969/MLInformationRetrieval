   Cotes's spiral      Cotes's spiral   In physics and in the mathematics of plane curves , Cotes's spiral (also written Cotes' spiral and Cotes spiral ) is a spiral that is typically written in one of three forms       1  r   =   A   cos   (    k  θ   +  ε   )           1  r     A        k  θ   ε       \frac{1}{r}=A\cos\left(k\theta+\varepsilon\right)          1  r   =   A   cosh   (    k  θ   +  ε   )           1  r     A        k  θ   ε       \frac{1}{r}=A\cosh\left(k\theta+\varepsilon\right)          1  r   =    A  θ   +  ε         1  r       A  θ   ε     \frac{1}{r}=A\theta+\varepsilon     where r and θ are the radius and azimuthal angle in a polar coordinate system , respectively, and A , k and ε are arbitrary real number constants. These spirals are named after Roger Cotes . The first form corresponds to an epispiral , and the second to one of Poinsot's spirals ; the third form corresponds to a hyperbolic spiral , also known as a reciprocal spiral , which is sometimes not counted as a Cotes's spiral. 1  The significance of Cotes's spirals for physics is in the field of classical mechanics . These spirals are the solutions for the motion of a particle moving under a inverse-cube central force , e.g.,       F   (  r  )    =   μ   r  3          F  r     μ   superscript  r  3      F(r)=\frac{\mu}{r^{3}}     where μ is any real number constant. A central force is one that depends only on the distance r between the moving particle and a point fixed in space, the center. In this case, the constant k of the spiral can be determined from μ and the areal velocity of the particle h by the formula       k  2   =   1  -   μ   h  2          superscript  k  2     1    μ   superscript  h  2       k^{2}=1-\frac{\mu}{h^{2}}     when μ 2 ( cosine form of the spiral) and       k  2   =    μ   h  2    -  1        superscript  k  2       μ   superscript  h  2    1     k^{2}=\frac{\mu}{h^{2}}-1     when μ > h 2 ( hyperbolic cosine form of the spiral). When μ = h 2 exactly, the particle follows the third form of the spiral        1  r   =    A  θ   +  ε    .        1  r       A  θ   ε     \frac{1}{r}=A\theta+\varepsilon.
