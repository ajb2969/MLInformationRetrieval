Strongly interacting massive particle

Strongly interacting massive particles (SIMPs) are hypothetical particles that interact strongly with ordinary matter, but could form the inferred dark matter despite this.1
Strongly interacting massive particles have been proposed as a solution for the ultra-high-energy cosmic-ray problem23 and the absence of cooling flows.45 Various experiments and observations have set constraints on SIMP dark matter from 1990 onward.67891011
SIMPs annhilations would produce significant heat. DAMA set limits with NaITl crystals.12
Measurements of Uranus's heat excess exclude SIMPS from 150 MeV to 104 GeV. Earth's heat flow significantly constrains any cross section.13
