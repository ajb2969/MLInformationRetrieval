Closed range theorem




Closed range theorem

In the mathematical theory of Banach spaces, the closed range theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed densely defined operator to have closed range.
History
The theorem was proved by Stefan Banach in his 1932 Théorie des opérations linéaires.
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be Banach spaces, 
 
 
 
  a closed linear operator whose domain 
 
 
 
  is dense in 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  the transpose of 
 
 
 
 . The theorem asserts that the following conditions are equivalent:



 
 , the range of 
 
 
 
 , is closed in 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 , the range of 
 
 
 
 , is closed in 
 
 
 
 , the dual of 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 ,


 
 .

Corollaries
Several corollaries are immediate from the theorem. For instance, a densely defined closed operator 
 
 
 
  as above has 
 
 
 
  if and only if the transpose 
 
 
 
  has a continuous inverse. Similarly, 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  has a continuous inverse.
