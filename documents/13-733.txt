   Closed range theorem      Closed range theorem   In the mathematical theory of Banach spaces , the closed range theorem gives necessary and sufficient conditions for a closed  densely defined operator to have closed  range .  History  The theorem was proved by Stefan Banach in his 1932 Théorie des opérations linéaires .  Statement  Let   X   X   X   and   Y   Y   Y   be Banach spaces,    T  :    D   (  T  )    →  Y      normal-:  T   normal-→    D  T   Y     T\colon D(T)\to Y   a closed linear operator whose domain    D   (  T  )       D  T    D(T)   is dense in   X   X   X   , and    T  ′     superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}   the transpose of   T   T   T   . The theorem asserts that the following conditions are equivalent:       R   (  T  )       R  T    R(T)   , the range of   T   T   T   , is closed in   Y   Y   Y   ,      R   (   T  ′   )       R   superscript  T  normal-′     R(T^{\prime})   , the range of    T  ′     superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}   , is closed in    X  ′     superscript  X  normal-′    X^{\prime}   , the dual of   X   X   X   ,       R   (  T  )    =   N    (   T  ′   )   ⟂    =   {   y  ∈  Y   |     ⟨   x  *   ,  y  ⟩   =   0  for all      x  *   ∈   N   (   T  ′   )      }           R  T     N   superscript   superscript  T  normal-′   perpendicular-to          conditional-set    y  Y    formulae-sequence      superscript  x    y    0  for all       superscript  x      N   superscript  T  normal-′          R(T)=N(T^{\prime})^{\perp}=\{y\in Y|\langle x^{*},y\rangle=0\quad{\text{for %
 all}}\quad x^{*}\in N(T^{\prime})\}   ,       R   (   T  ′   )    =   N    (  T  )   ⟂    =   {    x  *   ∈   X  ′    |     ⟨   x  *   ,  y  ⟩   =   0  for all     y  ∈   N   (  T  )      }           R   superscript  T  normal-′      N   superscript  T  perpendicular-to          conditional-set     superscript  x     superscript  X  normal-′     formulae-sequence      superscript  x    y    0  for all      y    N  T         R(T^{\prime})=N(T)^{\perp}=\{x^{*}\in X^{\prime}|\langle x^{*},y\rangle=0\quad%
 {\text{for all}}\quad y\in N(T)\}   .   Corollaries  Several corollaries are immediate from the theorem. For instance, a densely defined closed operator   T   T   T   as above has     R   (  T  )    =  Y        R  T   Y    R(T)=Y   if and only if the transpose    T  ′     superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}   has a continuous inverse. Similarly,     R   (   T  ′   )    =   X  ′         R   superscript  T  normal-′     superscript  X  normal-′     R(T^{\prime})=X^{\prime}   if and only if   T   T   T   has a continuous inverse.
