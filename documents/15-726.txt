   Excursion probability      Excursion probability   In probability theory , an excursion probability is the probability that a stochastic process surpasses a given value in a fixed time period. It is the probability 1      ℙ   {   sup   t  ∈  T    f   (  t  )   ≥  u  }   .     fragments  P   fragments  normal-{   subscript  supremum    t  T    f   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    u  normal-}   normal-.    \mathbb{P}\left\{\sup_{t\in T}f(t)\geq u\right\}.   Numerous approximation methods for the situation where u is large and f( t ) is a Gaussian process have been proposed such as Rice's formula . 2 3 First-excursion probabilities can be used to describe deflection to a critical point experienced by structures during "random loadings, such as earthquakes, strong gusts, hurricanes, etc." 4  References  "  Category:Stochastic processes     ↩   ↩  ↩
