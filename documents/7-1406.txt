Mitsuhiro Shishikura

  is a Japanese mathematician working in the field of complex dynamics. He is professor at Kyoto University in Japan.
Shishikura became internationally recognized1 for two of his earliest contributions, both of which solved long-standing open problems.

In his Master's thesis, he proved a conjectured of Fatou from 19202 by showing that a rational function of degree $d\,$ has at most $2d-2\,$ nonrepelling periodic cycles.3
He proved4 that the boundary of the Mandelbrot set has Hausdorff dimension two, confirming a conjecture stated by Mandelbrot5 and Milnor.J. Milnor, Self-similarity and hairiness in the Mandelbrot set, in: Computers in Geometry and Topology, ed. M. C. Tangora, Lect. Notes in Pure and Appl. Math., Marcel

Dekker, Vol. 114 (1989), 211-257
For his results, he was awarded the Salem Prize in 1992, and the Iyanaga Spring Prize of the Mathematical Society of Japan in 1995.
More recent results of Shishikura include

(in joint work with Kisaka6) the existence of a transcendental entire function with a doubly connected wandering domain, answering a question of Baker from 1985;7
(in joint work with Inou8) a study of near-parabolic renormalization which is essential in Buff and Chéritat's recent proof of the existence of polynomial Julia sets of positive planar Lebesgue measure.

One of the main tools pioneered by Shishikura and used throughout his work is that of quasiconformal surgery.
