Kaplan–Yorke conjecture

In applied mathematics, the Kaplan–Yorke conjecture concerns the dimension of an attractor, using Lyapunov exponents.12 By arranging the Lyapunov exponents in order from largest to smallest 
 
 
 
 , let j be the index for which



and



Then the conjecture is that the dimension of the attractor is



Examples
Especially for chaotic systems, the Kaplan–Yorke conjecture is a useful tool in order to determine the fractal dimension of the corresponding attractor.3

The Hénon map with parameters a = 1.4 and b = 0.3 has the ordered Lyapunov exponents 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . In this case, we find j = 1 and the dimension formula reduces to










The Lorenz system shows chaotic behavior at the parameter values 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . The resulting Lyapunov exponents are {2.16, 0.00, -32.4}. Noting that j = 2, we find
