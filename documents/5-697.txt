Quarter period

In mathematics, the quarter periods K(m) and iK ′(m) are special functions that appear in the theory of elliptic functions.
The quarter periods K and iK ′ are given by



and



When m is a real number, 0 ≤ m ≤ 1, then both K and K ′ are real numbers. By convention, K is called the real quarter period and iK ′ is called the imaginary quarter period. Any one of the numbers m, K, K ′, or K ′/K uniquely determines the others.
These functions appear in the theory of Jacobian elliptic functions; they are called quarter periods because the elliptic functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are periodic functions with periods 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  .
The quarter periods are essentially the elliptic integral of the first kind, by making the substitution 
 
 
 
 . In this case, one writes 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
 , understanding the difference between the two depends notationally on whether 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is used. This notational difference has spawned a terminology to go with it:



 
  is called the parameter


 
  is called the complementary parameter


 
  is called the elliptic modulus


 
  is called the complementary elliptic modulus, where 
 
 



 
  the modular angle, where 
 
 



 
  the complementary modular angle. Note that




The elliptic modulus can be expressed in terms of the quarter periods as



and



where ns and dn Jacobian elliptic functions.
The nome

 
  is given by



The complementary nome is given by



The real quarter period can be expressed as a Lambert series involving the nome:
