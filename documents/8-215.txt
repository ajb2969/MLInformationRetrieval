   Cyclotron resonance      Cyclotron resonance   Cyclotron resonance describes the interaction of external forces with charged particles experiencing a magnetic field , thus already moving on a circular path. It is named after the cyclotron , a cyclic particle accelerator that utilizes an oscillating electric field tuned to this resonance to add kinetic energy to charged particles.  The cyclotron frequency or gyrofrequency is the frequency of a charged particle moving perpendicular to the direction of a uniform magnetic field B (constant magnitude and direction). Since that motion is always circular, 1 the cyclotron frequency is given by equality of centripetal force and magnetic Lorentz force        m   v  2    r   =   q  B  v           m   superscript  v  2    r     q  B  v     \frac{mv^{2}}{r}=qBv     with the particle mass m , its charge q , velocity v , and the circular path radius r , also called gyroradius .  By substitution for the circulation frequency    f  =   v   2  π  r        f    v    2  π  r      f=\frac{v}{2\pi r}   which defines the cyclotron frequency, this leads to      f  =    q  B    2  π  m        f      q  B     2  π  m      f=\frac{qB}{2\pi m}   ,  or the angular frequency      ω  =   2  π  f   =    q  B   m         ω    2  π  f            q  B   m      \omega=2\pi f=\frac{qB}{m}   ,  It is notable that the cyclotron frequency is independent of the radius and velocity and therefore independent of the particle's energy.
