   Isotopes of strontium      Isotopes of strontium   The alkaline earth metal  strontium ( Sr ) has four stable, naturally occurring isotopes : 84 Sr (0.56%), 86 Sr (9.86%), 87 Sr (7.0%) and 88 Sr (82.58%). It has a standard atomic mass of 87.62(1) u .  Only 87 Sr is radiogenic ; it is produced by decay from the radioactive alkali metal 87 Rb , which has a half-life of 4.88 × 10 10 years. Thus, there are two sources of 87 Sr in any material: primordial that formed during nucleosynthesis along with 84 Sr, 86 Sr and 88 Sr, as well as that formed by radioactive decay of 87 Rb. The ratio 87 Sr/ 86 Sr is the parameter typically reported in geologic investigations; ratios in minerals and rocks have values ranging from about 0.7 to greater than 4.0. Because strontium has an electron configuration similar to that of calcium , it readily substitutes for Ca in minerals .  Thirty-one unstable isotopes are known to exist, the longest-lived of which are 90 Sr with a half-life of 28.9 years and 85 Sr with a half-life of 64.853 days. Of importance are strontium-89 ( 89 Sr) with a half-life of 50.57 days, and strontium-90 ( 90 Sr) . They decay by emitting an electron and an anti-neutrino (     ν  ¯   e     subscript   normal-¯  ν   e    \bar{\nu}_{e}   ) in beta decay (β − decay) to become yttrium :       Sr   38  89   →    Y   39  89   +   e  -   +    ν  ¯   e       normal-→   superscript   subscript  Sr  38   89      superscript   subscript  normal-Y  39   89    superscript  e     subscript   normal-¯  ν   e      \mathrm{{}^{89}_{38}Sr}\rightarrow\mathrm{{}^{89}_{39}Y}+e^{-}+\bar{\nu}_{e}          Sr   38  90   →    Y   39  90   +   e  -   +    ν  ¯   e       normal-→   superscript   subscript  Sr  38   90      superscript   subscript  normal-Y  39   90    superscript  e     subscript   normal-¯  ν   e      \mathrm{{}^{90}_{38}Sr}\rightarrow\mathrm{{}^{90}_{39}Y}+e^{-}+\bar{\nu}_{e}    89 Sr is an artificial radioisotope which is used in treatment of bone cancer. In circumstances where cancer patients have widespread and painful bony metastases , the administration of 89 Sr results in the delivery of beta particles directly to the area of bony problem, where calcium turnover is greatest.  90 Sr is a by-product of nuclear fission which is found in nuclear fallout and presents a health problem since it substitutes for calcium in bone , preventing expulsion from the body. Because it is a long-lived high-energy beta emitter, it is used in SNAP ( Systems for Nuclear Auxiliary Power ) devices. These devices hold promise for use in spacecraft , remote weather stations, navigational buoys, etc., where a lightweight, long-lived, nuclear-electric power source is required. The 1986 Chernobyl nuclear accident contaminated a vast area with 90 Sr.  The lightest isotope is 73 Sr and the heaviest being 107 Sr.  All other isotopes have half-lives shorter than 55 days, most under 100 minutes.

The precision of the isotope abundances and atomic mass is limited through variations. The given ranges should be applicable to any normal terrestrial material.  Geologically exceptional samples are known in which the isotopic composition lies outside the reported range. The uncertainty in the atomic mass may exceed the stated value for such specimens.  Values marked # are not purely derived from experimental data, but at least partly from systematic trends. Spins with weak assignment arguments are enclosed in parentheses.  Uncertainties are given in concise form in parentheses after the corresponding last digits. Uncertainty values denote one standard deviation, except isotopic composition and standard atomic mass from IUPAC which use expanded uncertainties.
