Lüroth's theorem

In mathematics, Lüroth's theorem asserts that every field that lies between two other fields K and K(X) must be generated as an extension of K by a single element of K(X). This result is named after Jacob Lüroth, who proved it in 1876.1
Statement
Let 
 
 
 
  be a field and 
 
 
 
  be an intermediate field between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , for some indeterminate X. Then there exists a rational function

 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . In other words, every intermediate extension between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a simple extension.
Proofs
The proof of Lüroth's theorem can be derived easily from the theory of rational curves, using the geometric genus.2 This method is non-elementary, but several short proofs using only the basics of field theory have long been known. Many of these simple proofs use Gauss's lemma on primitive polynomials as a main step.3
