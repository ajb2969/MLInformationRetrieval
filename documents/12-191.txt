   Lüroth's theorem      Lüroth's theorem   In mathematics , Lüroth's theorem asserts that every field that lies between two other fields K and K ( X ) must be generated as an extension of K by a single element of K ( X ). This result is named after Jacob Lüroth , who proved it in 1876. 1  Statement  Let   K   K   K   be a field and   M   M   M   be an intermediate field between   K   K   K   and    K   (  X  )       K  X    K(X)   , for some indeterminate X . Then there exists a rational function      f   (  X  )    ∈   K   (  X  )          f  X     K  X     f(X)\in K(X)   such that    M  =   K   (   f   (  X  )    )        M    K    f  X      M=K(f(X))   . In other words, every intermediate extension between   K   K   K   and    K   (  X  )       K  X    K(X)   is a simple extension .  Proofs  The proof of Lüroth's theorem can be derived easily from the theory of rational curves , using the geometric genus . 2 This method is non-elementary, but several short proofs using only the basics of field theory have long been known. Many of these simple proofs use Gauss's lemma on primitive polynomials as a main step. 3  References  "  Category:Algebraic varieties  Category:Birational geometry  Category:Field theory  Category:Theorems in algebraic geometry     ↩  . ↩  E.g. see . ↩
