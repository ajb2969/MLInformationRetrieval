Neoxanthin synthase

In enzymology, a neoxanthin synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

violaxanthin 
 
 
 
  neoxanthin
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, violaxanthin, and one product, neoxanthin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically a class of other intramolecular oxidoreductases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is violaxanthin---neoxanthin isomerase (epoxide-opening). This enzyme is also called NSY. This enzyme participates in carotenoid biosynthesis - general.
