   Riesz–Fischer theorem      Riesz–Fischer theorem   In mathematics , the Riesz–Fischer theorem in real analysis is any of a number of closely related results concerning the properties of the space L 2 of square integrable functions. The theorem was proven independently in 1907 by Frigyes Riesz and Ernst Sigismund Fischer .  For many authors, the Riesz–Fischer theorem refers to the fact that the L p spaces from Lebesgue integration theory are complete .  Modern forms of the theorem  The most common form of the theorem states that a measurable function on [–π, π] is square integrable  if and only if the corresponding Fourier series converges in the space L 2 . This means that if the N th partial sum of the Fourier series corresponding to a square-integrable function f is given by         S  N   f   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  =   -  N    N      F  n     e   i  n  x       ,         subscript  S  N   f  x     superscript   subscript     n    N     N      subscript  F  n    superscript  normal-e    i  n  x        S_{N}f(x)=\sum_{n=-N}^{N}F_{n}\,\mathrm{e}^{inx},     where F n , the n th Fourier coefficient , is given by        F  n   =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π    f   (  x  )     e   -   i  n  x      d  x      ,       subscript  F  n       1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π     f  x   superscript  normal-e      i  n  x     normal-d  x       F_{n}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(x)\,\mathrm{e}^{-inx}\,\mathrm{d}x,     then         lim   N  →  ∞      ∥     S  N   f   -  f   ∥   2    =  0   ,        subscript    normal-→  N      subscript   norm       subscript  S  N   f   f    2    0    \lim_{N\to\infty}\left\|S_{N}f-f\right\|_{2}=0,     where    ∥  ⋅   ∥  2      fragments  normal-∥  normal-⋅   subscript  normal-∥  2     \left\|\cdot\right\|_{2}   is the L 2 - norm .  Conversely, if    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \left\{a_{n}\right\}\,   is a two-sided sequence of complex numbers (that is, its indices range from negative infinity to positive infinity) such that         ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     |   a  n   |   2    <  ∞   ,        superscript   subscript     n           superscript     subscript  a  n    2       \sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}\left|a_{n}\right|^{2}<\infty,     then there exists a function f such that f is square-integrable and the values    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   are the Fourier coefficients of f .  This form of the Riesz–Fischer theorem is a stronger form of Bessel's inequality , and can be used to prove Parseval's identity for Fourier series .  Other results are often called the Riesz–Fischer theorem . Among them is the theorem that, if A is an orthonormal set in a Hilbert space  H , and x ∈ H , then       ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   =  0       x  y   0    \langle x,y\rangle=0   for all but countably many y ∈ A , and         ∑   y  ∈  A      |   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   |   2    ≤    ∥  x  ∥   2    .        subscript     y  A     superscript     x  y    2     superscript   norm  x   2     \sum_{y\in A}|\langle x,y\rangle|^{2}\leq\|x\|^{2}.   Furthermore, if A is an orthonormal basis for H and x an arbitrary vector, the series       ∑   y  ∈  A      ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   y       subscript     y  A       x  y   y     \sum_{y\in A}\langle x,y\rangle\,y   converges commutatively (or unconditionally ) to x . This is equivalent to saying that for every ε > 0, there exists a finite set B 0 in A such that       ∥   x  -    ∑   y  ∈  B      ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   y     ∥   <  ε       norm    x    subscript     y  B       x  y   y      ε    \|x-\sum_{y\in B}\langle x,y\rangle y\|<\varepsilon   for every finite set B containing B 0 . Moreover, the following conditions on the set A are equivalent:   the set A is an orthonormal basis of H  for every vector x ∈ H ,            ∥  x  ∥   2   =    ∑   y  ∈  A      |   ⟨  x  ,  y  ⟩   |   2     .       superscript   norm  x   2     subscript     y  A     superscript     x  y    2      \|x\|^{2}=\sum_{y\in A}|\langle x,y\rangle|^{2}.        Another result, which also sometimes bears the name of Riesz and Fischer, is the theorem that L 2 (or more generally L p , 0 \phi_n} be an orthonormal system in R (e.g. Fourier basis, Hermite or Laguerre polynomials , etc. – see orthogonal polynomials ), not necessarily complete (in an inner product space, an orthonormal set is complete if no nonzero vector is orthogonal to every vector in the set). The theorem asserts that if the normed space R is complete (thus R is a Hilbert space ), then any sequence {    c  n     subscript  c  n    c_{n}   } that has finite ℓ 2 norm defines a function f in the space R .  The function f is defined by    f  =    lim   n  →  ∞      ∑   k  =  0   n     c  k    ϕ  k          f    subscript    normal-→  n       superscript   subscript     k  0    n      subscript  c  k    subscript  ϕ  k        f=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{k=0}^{n}c_{k}\phi_{k}   , limit in R -norm.  Combined with the Bessel's inequality , we know the converse as well: if f is a function in R , then the Fourier coefficients    (  f  ,   ϕ  n   )     f   subscript  ϕ  n     (f,\phi_{n})   have finite ℓ 2  norm .  History: the Note of Riesz and the Note of Fischer (1907)  In his Note,  states the following result (translated here to modern language at one point: the notation L 2 ([ a , b ]) was not used in 1907).   Let {φ n } be an orthonormal system in  L 2 ([ a , b ]) and {a n } a sequence of reals. The convergence of the series    ∑   a  n  2        superscript   subscript  a  n   2     \sum a_{n}^{2}   is a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a function  f  such that        ∫  a  b    f   (  x  )    φ  n    (  x  )   d  x    =   a  n         superscript   subscript   a   b     f  x   subscript  φ  n   x  normal-d  x     subscript  a  n     \int_{a}^{b}f(x)\varphi_{n}(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=a_{n}      for every  n .   Today, this result of Riesz is a special case of basic facts about series of orthogonal vectors in Hilbert spaces.  Riesz's Note appeared in March. In May,  states explicitly in a theorem (almost with modern words) that a Cauchy sequence in L 2 ([ a , b ]) converges in L 2 -norm to some function f in L 2 ([ a , b ]). In this Note, Cauchy sequences are called " sequences converging in the mean " and L 2 ([ a , b ]) is denoted by Ω . Also, convergence to a limit in L 2 –norm is called " convergence in the mean towards a function ". Here is the statement, translated from French:   Theorem.  If a sequence of functions belonging to Ω  converges in the mean, there exists in Ω a function f towards which the sequence converges in the mean.    Fischer goes on proving the preceding result of Riesz, as a consequence of the orthogonality of the system, and of the completeness of L 2 .  Fischer's proof of completeness is somewhat indirect. It uses the fact that the indefinite integrals of the functions g n in the given Cauchy sequence, namely         G  n    (  x  )    =    ∫  a  x     g  n    (  t  )   d  t     ,         subscript  G  n   x     superscript   subscript   a   x      subscript  g  n   t  normal-d  t      G_{n}(x)=\int_{a}^{x}g_{n}(t)\,\mathrm{d}t,   converge uniformly on [ a , b ] to some function G , continuous with bounded variation. The existence of the limit g ∈ L 2 for the Cauchy sequence is obtained by applying to G differentiation theorems from Lebesgue's theory. Riesz uses a similar reasoning in his Note, but makes no explicit mention to the completeness of L 2 , although his result may be interpreted this way. He says that integrating term by term a trigonometric series with given square summable coefficients, he gets a series converging uniformly to a continuous function F with bounded variation. The derivative f of F , defined almost everywhere, is square summable and has for Fourier coefficients the given coefficients.  == Completeness of L p ,  0 p'' is complete is based on the convergence theorems for the Lebesgue integral .  When 1 ≤ p ≤ ∞, the Minkowski inequality implies that the space L p is a normed space. In order to prove that L p is complete, i.e. that L p is a Banach space , it is enough (see e.g. Banach space#Definition ) to prove that every series ∑ u n of functions in L p ( μ ) such that       ∑    ∥   u  n   ∥   p    <  ∞         subscript   norm   subscript  u  n    p       \sum\|u_{n}\|_{p}<\infty     converges in the L p -norm to some function f ∈ L p ( μ ). For p \int \Bigl( \sum_{n=0}^\infty |u_n| \Bigr)^p \, \mathrm{d}\mu \le \Bigl( \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \|u_n\|_p \Bigr)^p  is defined μ –almost everywhere and f ∈ L p ( μ ). The dominated convergence theorem is then used to prove that the partial sums of the series converge to f in the L p -norm,        ∫      |   f  -    ∑   k  =  0   n    u  k     |   p    d  μ    ≤   ∫      (    ∑   ℓ  >  n     |   u  ℓ   |    )   p    d  μ    →   0  as  n   →  ∞   .             superscript      f    superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  u  k      p   normal-d  μ         superscript    subscript     normal-ℓ  n       subscript  u  normal-ℓ     p   normal-d  μ      normal-→      0  as  n     normal-→        \int\left|f-\sum_{k=0}^{n}u_{k}\right|^{p}\,\mathrm{d}\mu\leq\int\left(\sum_{%

The case 0  \sum \|u_n\|_p^p  and uses repeatedly that        |    ∑   k  =  0   n    u  k    |   p   ≤    ∑   k  =  0   n      |   u  k   |   p   when  p    <  1         superscript      superscript   subscript     k  0    n    subscript  u  k     p     superscript   subscript     k  0    n      superscript     subscript  u  k    p   when  p         1     \left|\sum_{k=0}^{n}u_{k}\right|^{p}\leq\sum_{k=0}^{n}|u_{k}|^{p}\text{ when }%
