   Corticosterone 18-monooxygenase      Corticosterone 18-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a corticosterone 18-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   corticosterone + reduced adrenal ferredoxin + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   18-hydroxycorticosterone + oxidized adrenal ferredoxin + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are corticosterone , reduced adrenal ferredoxin , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 18-hydroxycorticosterone , oxidized adrenal ferredoxin , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with reduced iron-sulfur protein as one donor, and incorporation o one atom of oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is corticosterone,reduced-adrenal-ferredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (18-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include corticosterone 18-hydroxylase , and corticosterone methyl oxidase . This enzyme participates in c21-steroid hormone metabolism .
