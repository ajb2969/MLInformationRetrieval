Protein-histidine N-methyltransferase




Protein-histidine N-methyltransferase

In enzymology, a protein-histidine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + protein L-histidine 
 
 
 
  S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + protein Ntau-methyl-L-histidine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and protein L-histidine, whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and protein Ntau-methyl-L-histidine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:protein-L-histidine N-tele-methyltransferase. Other names in common use include protein methylase IV, protein (histidine) methyltransferase, actin-specific histidine methyltransferase, and S-adenosyl methionine:protein-histidine N-methyltransferase.
