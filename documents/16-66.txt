Alpha-gurjunene synthase




Alpha-gurjunene synthase

Alpha-gurjunene synthase () is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase ((-)-alpha-gurjunene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (-)-alpha-gurjunene + diphosphate


Initial cyclization probably gives biyclogermacrene in an enzyme bound form.
