Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase




Phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase

In enzymology, a phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-Mur2Ac(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) + undecaprenyl phosphate 
 
 
 
  UMP + Mur2Ac(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala)- diphosphoundecaprenol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-Mur2Ac(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala) and undecaprenyl phosphate, whereas its 3 products are UMP, Mur2Ac(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala)-, and diphosphoundecaprenol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-MurAc(oyl-L-Ala-gamma-D-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala):undecaprenyl-phos phate phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl-pentapeptide-transferase. Other names in common use include MraY transferase, UDP-MurNAc-L-Ala-D-gamma-Glu-L-Lys-D-Ala-D-Ala:C55-isoprenoid, alcohol transferase, UDP-MurNAc-Ala-gammaDGlu-Lys-DAla-DAla:undecaprenylphosphate, transferase, phospho-N-acetylmuramoyl pentapeptide translocase, phospho-MurNAc-pentapeptide transferase, phospho-NAc-muramoyl-pentapeptide translocase (UMP), phosphoacetylmuramoylpentapeptide translocase, and phosphoacetylmuramoylpentapeptidetransferase. This enzyme participates in peptidoglycan biosynthesis. It can be expressed efficiently by cell-free protein expression system.1
