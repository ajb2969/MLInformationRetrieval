   Kähler manifold      Kähler manifold   In mathematics and especially differential geometry , a Kähler manifold is a manifold with three mutually compatible structures; a complex structure , a Riemannian structure , and a symplectic structure . On a Kähler manifold X there exists Kähler potential and the Levi-Civita connection corresponding to the metric of X gives rise to a connection on the canonical line bundle .  Smooth projective algebraic varieties are examples of Kähler manifolds. By Kodaira embedding theorem , Kähler manifolds that have a positive line bundle can always be embedded into projective spaces.  They are named after German mathematician Erich Kähler .  Definitions  Since Kähler manifolds are naturally equipped with several compatible structures, there are many equivalent ways of creating Kähler forms.  Symplectic viewpoint  A Kähler manifold is a symplectic manifold     (  K  ,  ω  )     K  ω    (K,\omega)   equipped with an integrable almost-complex structure which is compatible with the symplectic form . 1  Complex viewpoint  A Kähler manifold is a Hermitian manifold whose associated Hermitian form is closed . The closed Hermitian form is called the Kähler metric .  Equivalence of definitions  Every Hermitian manifold   K   K   K   is a complex manifold which comes naturally equipped with a Hermitian form   h   h   h   and an integrable, almost complex structure    J   J   J   . Assuming that   h   h   h   is closed, there is a canonical symplectic form defined as    ω  =    i  2    (   h  -   h  ¯    )        ω      i  2     h   normal-¯  h       \omega=\frac{i}{2}(h-\bar{h})   which is compatible with   J   J   J   , hence satisfying the first definition.  On the other hand, any symplectic form compatible with an almost complex structure must be a complex differential form of type    (  1  ,  1  )     1  1    (1,1)   , written in a coordinate chart    (  U  ,   z  i   )     U   subscript  z  i     (U,z_{i})   as      ω  =     i  2     ∑   j  ,  k      h   j  k    d   z  j      ∧   d    z  k   ¯         ω        i  2     subscript    j  k       subscript  h    j  k    d   subscript  z  j        d   normal-¯   subscript  z  k        \omega=\frac{i}{2}\sum_{j,k}h_{jk}dz_{j}\wedge d\bar{z_{k}}   for     h   j  k    ∈    C  ∞    (  U  ,  ℂ  )         subscript  h    j  k       superscript  C     U  ℂ      h_{jk}\in C^{\infty}(U,\mathbb{C})   . The added assertions that   ω   ω   \omega   be real-valued, closed, and non-degenerate guarantee that the    h   j  k      subscript  h    j  k     h_{jk}   define Hermitian forms at each point in   K   K   K   . 2  Connection between Hermitian and symplectic definitions  Let   h   h   h   be the Hermitian form,   ω   ω   \omega   the symplectic form, and   J   J   J   the almost complex structure. Since   ω   ω   \omega   and   J   J   J   are compatible, the new form     g   (  u  ,  v  )    =   ω   (  u  ,   J  v   )          g   u  v      ω   u    J  v       g(u,v)=\omega(u,Jv)   is Riemannian. 3 One may then summarize the connection between these structures via the identity    h  =   g  +   i  ω        h    g    i  ω      h=g+i\omega   .  Kähler potentials  If   K   K   K   is a complex manifold, it can be shown 4 that every strictly plurisubharmonic function     ρ  ∈    C  ∞    (  K  ;  ℝ  )        ρ     superscript  C     K  ℝ      \rho\in C^{\infty}(K;\mathbb{R})   gives rise to a Kähler form as      ω  =    i  2    ∂    ∂  ¯   ρ         ω      i  2        normal-¯    ρ       \omega=\frac{i}{2}\partial\bar{\partial}\rho   where    ∂  ,   ∂  ¯        normal-¯      \partial,\bar{\partial}   are the Dolbeault operators . The function   ρ   ρ   \rho   is said to be a Kähler potential.  In fact, utilizing the holomorphic version of the Poincaré lemma , a partial converse holds true locally. More specifically, if    (  K  ,  ω  )     K  ω    (K,\omega)   is a Kähler manifold then about every point    p  ∈  K      p  K    p\in K   there is a neighbourhood   U   U   U   containing   p   p   p   and a function    ρ  ∈    C  ∞    (  U  ,  ℝ  )        ρ     superscript  C     U  ℝ      \rho\in C^{\infty}(U,\mathbb{R})   such that      ω  |   U   =   i   ∂    ∂  ¯   ρ          evaluated-at  ω  U     i       normal-¯    ρ       \omega|_{U}=i\partial\bar{\partial}\rho   and here   ρ   ρ   \rho   is termed a (local) Kähler potential.

The Laplacians on Kähler manifolds  On any Riemannian manifold we can define the Laplacian as     Δ  d   =    d   d  *    +    d  *   d         subscript  normal-Δ  d       d   superscript  d        superscript  d    d      \Delta_{d}=dd^{*}+d^{*}d   where   d   d   d   is the exterior derivative and     d  *   =  -    (  -  1  )    n  k    ⋆  d  ⋆     fragments   superscript  d       superscript   fragments  normal-(   1  normal-)     n  k    normal-⋆  d  normal-⋆    d^{*}=-(-1)^{nk}\star d\star   , with the Hodge operator    ⋆   normal-⋆   \star   (alternatively,    d  *     superscript  d     d^{*}   is the adjoint of   d   d   d   with respect to the    L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   scalar product). Furthermore if X is Kähler then   d   d   d   and    d  *     superscript  d     d^{*}   are decomposed as       d  =   ∂  +   ∂  ¯     ,    d  *   =    ∂  *   +    ∂  ¯   *        formulae-sequence    d      normal-¯         superscript  d       superscript      superscript   normal-¯          d=\partial+\bar{\partial},\ \ \ \ d^{*}=\partial^{*}+\bar{\partial}^{*}     and we can define two other Laplacians        Δ   ∂  ¯    =     ∂  ¯     ∂  ¯   *    +     ∂  ¯   *    ∂  ¯      ,    Δ  ∂   =    ∂   ∂  *    +    ∂  *   ∂        formulae-sequence     subscript  normal-Δ   normal-¯          normal-¯     superscript   normal-¯          superscript   normal-¯       normal-¯          subscript  normal-Δ         superscript        superscript           \Delta_{\bar{\partial}}=\bar{\partial}\bar{\partial}^{*}+\bar{\partial}^{*}%
 \bar{\partial},\ \ \ \ \Delta_{\partial}=\partial\partial^{*}+\partial^{*}\partial     that satisfy        Δ  d   =   2   Δ   ∂  ¯     =   2   Δ  ∂     .         subscript  normal-Δ  d     2   subscript  normal-Δ   normal-¯             2   subscript  normal-Δ        \Delta_{d}=2\Delta_{\bar{\partial}}=2\Delta_{\partial}.     From these facts we obtain the Hodge decomposition (see Hodge theory )       𝐇  𝐫   =    ⊕    p  +  q   =  r     𝐇   p  ,  q          superscript  𝐇  𝐫     subscript  direct-sum      p  q   r     superscript  𝐇   p  q       \mathbf{H^{r}}=\bigoplus_{p+q=r}\mathbf{H}^{p,q}     where    𝐇  𝐫     superscript  𝐇  𝐫    \mathbf{H^{r}}   is r-degree harmonic form and    𝐇   p  ,  q      superscript  𝐇   p  q     \mathbf{H}^{p,q}   is {p,q}-degree harmonic form on X . Namely, a differential form   α   α   \alpha   is harmonic if and only if each    α   i  ,  j      superscript  α   i  j     \alpha^{i,j}   belong to the {i,j}-degree harmonic form.  Further, if X is compact then we obtain        H  p    (  X  ,   Ω  q   )    ≃    H   ∂  ¯    p  ,  q     (  X  )    ≃   𝐇   p  ,  q         similar-to-or-equals     superscript  H  p    X   superscript  normal-Ω  q        subscript   superscript  H   p  q     normal-¯     X     similar-to-or-equals     superscript  𝐇   p  q       H^{p}(X,\Omega^{q})\simeq H^{p,q}_{\bar{\partial}}(X)\simeq\mathbf{H}^{p,q}   where     H   ∂  ¯    p  ,  q     (  X  )        subscript   superscript  H   p  q     normal-¯     X    H^{p,q}_{\bar{\partial}}(X)   is    ∂  ¯     normal-¯     \bar{\partial}   -harmonic cohomology group. This means that if   α   α   \alpha   is a differential form with {p,q}-degree there is only one element in {p,q}-harmonic form due to Dolbeault theorem .  Let     h   p  ,  q    =   dim   H   p  ,  q          superscript  h   p  q      dim   superscript  H   p  q       h^{p,q}=\text{dim}H^{p,q}   , called Hodge number, then we obtain         b  r   =    ∑    p  +  q   =  r     h   p  ,  q      ,     h   p  ,  q    =   h   q  ,  p     ,    h   p  ,  q    =   h    n  -  p   ,   n  -  q        .     formulae-sequence     subscript  b  r     subscript       p  q   r     superscript  h   p  q       formulae-sequence     superscript  h   p  q     superscript  h   q  p        superscript  h   p  q     superscript  h     n  p     n  q         b_{r}=\sum_{p+q=r}h^{p,q},\ \ \ \ h^{p,q}=h^{q,p},\ \ \ \ h^{p,q}=h^{n-p,n-q}.   The LHS of the first identity, b r , is r-th Betti number , the second identity comes from that since the Laplacian    Δ  d     subscript  normal-Δ  d    \Delta_{d}   is a real operator     H   p  ,  q    =    H   q  ,  p    ¯        superscript  H   p  q     normal-¯   superscript  H   q  p       H^{p,q}=\overline{H^{q,p}}   and the third identity comes from Serre duality .  Applications  On a Kähler manifold, the associated Kähler form and metric are called Kähler–Einstein (or sometimes Einstein–Kähler) if its Ricci tensor is proportional to the metric tensor ,    R  =   λ  g       R    λ  g     R=\lambda g   , for some constant λ. This name is a reminder of Einstein 's considerations about the cosmological constant . See the article on Einstein manifolds for more details.  Originally the Kähler condition is independent on the Einstein condition, in which Ricci tensor is proportional to Riemannian metric with constant real number. The important point is that if X is Kähler then Christoffel symbols     Γ   β  γ   α     subscript   superscript  normal-Γ  α     β  γ     \Gamma^{\alpha}_{\beta\gamma}   vanish and Ricci curvature is much simplified. The Kähler condition, therefore, is closely related with Ricci curvature. In fact Aubin and Yau proved the Calabi conjecture using the fact that on a compact Kähler manifold with the first Chern class  c 1 =0 there is a unique Ricci-flat Kähler metric in each Kähler class. But in non-compact case the situation turns to be more complicated and the final solution might not be reached.  Examples   Complex Euclidean space  C n with the standard Hermitian metric is a Kähler manifold.  A torus C n /Λ (Λ a full lattice ) inherits a flat metric from the Euclidean metric on C n , and is therefore a compact Kähler manifold.  Every Riemannian metric on a Riemann surface is Kähler, since the condition for ω to be closed is trivial in 2 (real) dimensions.  Complex projective space  CP n admits a homogeneous Kähler metric, the Fubini–Study metric . An Hermitian form in (the vector space) C n + 1 defines a unitary subgroup U ( n + 1) in GL ( n + 1, C ); a Fubini–Study metric is determined up to homothety (overall scaling) by invariance under such a U ( n + 1) action. By elementary linear algebra, any two Fubini–Study metrics are isometric under a projective automorphism of CP n , so it is common to speak of "the" Fubini–Study metric.  The induced metric on a complex submanifold of a Kähler manifold is Kähler. In particular, any Stein manifold (embedded in C n ) or projective algebraic variety (embedded in CP n ) is of Kähler type. This is fundamental to their analytic theory.  The unit complex ball B n admits a Kähler metric called the Bergman metric which has constant holomorphic sectional curvature.  Every K3 surface is Kähler (by a theorem of Y.-T. Siu).   An important subclass of Kähler manifolds are Calabi–Yau manifolds .
