   Lindelöf hypothesis      Lindelöf hypothesis   In mathematics , the Lindelöf hypothesis is a conjecture by Finnish mathematician Ernst Leonard Lindelöf (see ) about the rate of growth of the Riemann zeta function on the critical line that is implied by the Riemann hypothesis .  It says that, for any ε > 0,       ζ   (    1  2   +   i  t    )   is  𝒪   (   t  ε   )    ,      ζ      1  2     i  t    is  𝒪   superscript  t  ε     \zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\mbox{ is }\mathcal{O}(t^{\varepsilon}),     as t tends to infinity (see O notation ). Since ε can be replaced by a smaller value, we can also write the conjecture as, for any positive ε ,       ζ   (    1  2   +   i  t    )   is  o   (   t  ε   )    .      ζ      1  2     i  t    is  o   superscript  t  ε     \zeta\left(\frac{1}{2}+it\right)\mbox{ is }o(t^{\varepsilon}).     The μ function  If σ is real, then μ(σ) is defined to be the infimum of all real numbers a such that ζ ( σ + iT ) = O( T  a ). It is trivial to check that μ ( σ ) = 0 for σ > 1, and the functional equation of the zeta function implies that μ( σ ) = μ (1 − σ ) − σ + 1/2. The Phragmen–Lindelöf theorem implies that μ is a convex function . The Lindelöf hypothesis states μ(1/2) = 0, which together with the above properties of μ implies that μ ( σ ) is 0 for σ ≥ 1/2 and 1/2 − σ for σ ≤ 1/2.  Lindelöf's convexity result together with μ (1) = 0 and μ (0) = 1/2 implies that 0 ≤ μ (1/2) ≤ 1/4. The upper bound of 1/4 was lowered by Hardy and Littlewood to 1/6 by applying Weyl 's method of estimating exponential sums to the approximate functional equation . It has since been lowered to slightly less than 1/6 by several authors using long and technical proofs, as in the following table:      μ(1/2) ≤   μ(1/2) ≤   Author       1/4   0.25      1/6   0.1667      163/988   0.1650      27/164   0.1647      229/1392   0.164512       0.164511      19/116   0.1638      15/92   0.1631      6/37   0.16217      173/1067   0.16214      35/216   0.16204      139/858   0.16201      32/205   0.1561      53/342   0.1549      Relation to the Riemann hypothesis  showed that the Lindelöf hypothesis is equivalent to the following statement about the zeros of the zeta function: for every ε > 0, the number of zeros with real part at least 1/2 + ε and imaginary part between T and T + 1 is o(log( T )) as T tends to infinity. The Riemann hypothesis implies that there are no zeros at all in this region and so implies the Lindelöf hypothesis. The number of zeros with imaginary part between T and T + 1 is known to be O(log( T )), so the Lindelöf hypothesis seems only slightly stronger than what has already been proved, but in spite of this it has resisted all attempts to prove it and is very hard.  Means of powers (or moments) of the zeta function  The Lindelöf hypothesis is equivalent to the statement that        1  T     ∫  0  T       |   ζ   (    1  /  2   +   i  t    )    |    2  k     d  t     =   O   (   T  ε   )            1  T     superscript   subscript   0   T      superscript      ζ      1  2     i  t        2  k    d  t       O   superscript  T  ε      \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}|\zeta(1/2+it)|^{2k}\,dt=O(T^{\varepsilon})     for all positive integers k and all positive real numbers ε. This has been proved for k = 1 or 2, but the case k = 3 seems much harder and is still an open problem.  There is a much more precise conjecture about the asymptotic behavior of the integral: it is believed that       ∫  0  T   |  ζ   (  1  /  2  +  i  t  )     |   2  k     d  t  =  T   ∑   j  =  0    k  2     c   k  ,  j    log    (  T  )     k  2   -  j    +  o   (  T  )      fragments   superscript   subscript   0   T   normal-|  ζ   fragments  normal-(  1   2   i  t  normal-)    superscript  normal-|    2  k    d  t   T   superscript   subscript     j  0     superscript  k  2     subscript  c   k  j      superscript   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)      superscript  k  2   j     o   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)     \int_{0}^{T}|\zeta(1/2+it)|^{2k}\,dt=T\sum_{j=0}^{k^{2}}c_{k,j}\log(T)^{k^{2}-%

This has been proved by Littlewood for k = 1 and by  for k = 2 (extending a result of  who found the leading term).  suggested the value     (   42  /   9  !    )     ∏  p    (     (   1  -   p   -  1     )   4    (   1  +   4   p   -  1     +   p   -  2     )    )          42    9      subscript  product  p      superscript    1   superscript  p    1     4     1    4   superscript  p    1      superscript  p    2         (42/9!)\prod_{p}\left((1-p^{-1})^{4}(1+4p^{-1}+p^{-2})\right)   for the leading coefficient when k is 6, and  used random matrix theory to suggest some conjectures for the values of the coefficients for higher k . The leading coefficients are conjectured to be the product of an elementary factor, a certain product over primes, and the number of n by n Young tableaux given by the following sequence:   1, 1, 2, 42, 24024, 701149020, .   Other consequences  Denoting by p n the n -th prime number, a result by Albert Ingham , shows that the Lindelöf hypothesis implies that, for any ε > 0,        p   n  +  1    -   p  n    ≪    p  n    1  /  2   +  ε        much-less-than     subscript  p    n  1     subscript  p  n     superscript   subscript  p  n       1  2   ε      p_{n+1}-p_{n}\ll p_{n}^{1/2+\varepsilon}\,     if n is sufficiently large . However, this result is much worse than that of the large prime gap conjecture.
