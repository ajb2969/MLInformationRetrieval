Arithmetic progression

In mathematics, an '''arithmetic progression ''' (AP) or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 … is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.
If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is 
 
 
 
  and the common difference of successive members is d, then the nth term of the sequence (
 
 
 
 ) is given by:



and in general



A finite portion of an arithmetic progression is called a finite arithmetic progression and sometimes just called an arithmetic progression. The sum of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series.
The behavior of the arithmetic progression depends on the common difference d. If the common difference is:

Positive, the members (terms) will grow towards positive infinity.
Negative, the members (terms) will grow towards negative infinity.

Computation of the sum 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14. When the sequence is reversed and added to itself term by term, the resulting sequence has a single repeated value in it, equal to the sum of the first and last numbers (2 + 14 = 16). Thus 16 × 5 = 80 is twice the sum.



The sum of the members of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series. For example, consider the sum:



This sum can be found quickly by taking the number n of terms being added (here 5), multiplying by the sum of the first and last number in the progression (here 2 + 14 = 16), and dividing by 2:



In the case above, this gives the equation:



This formula works for any real numbers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . For example:



Derivation
To derive the above formula, begin by expressing the arithmetic series in two different ways:






Adding both sides of the two equations, all terms involving d cancel:



Dividing both sides by 2 produces a common form of the equation:



An alternate form results from re-inserting the substitution
 
 
 
 :



Furthermore the mean value of the series can be calculated via
 
 
 
 :



In 499 AD Aryabhata, a prominent mathematician-astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy, gave this method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.18).
Product
The product of the members of a finite arithmetic progression with an initial element a1, common differences d, and n elements in total is determined in a closed expression



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the rising factorial and 
 
 
 
  denotes the Gamma function. (Note however that the formula is not valid when 
 
 
 
  is a negative integer or zero.)
This is a generalization from the fact that the product of the progression 
 
 
 
  is given by the factorial

 
  and that the product



for positive integers

 
  and 
 
 
 
  is given by



Taking the example from above, the product of the terms of the arithmetic progression given by an = 3 + (n-1)(5) up to the 50th term is



Standard deviation
The standard deviation of any arithmetic progression can be calculated via:



where 
 
 
 
  is the number of terms in the progression, and 
 
 
 
  is the common difference between terms
Intersections
The intersection of any two doubly-infinite arithmetic progressions is either empty or another arithmetic progression, which can be found using the Chinese remainder theorem. If each two progressions in a family of doubly-infinite arithmetic progressions have a non-empty intersection, then there exists a number common to all of them; that is, infinite arithmetic progressions form a Helly family.1 However, the intersection of infinitely many infinite arithmetic progressions might be a single number rather than itself being an infinite progression.
