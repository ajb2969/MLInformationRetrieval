   Arithmetic progression      Arithmetic progression   In mathematics , an '''arithmetic progression ''' (AP) or arithmetic sequence is a sequence of numbers such that the difference between the consecutive terms is constant. For instance, the sequence 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15 … is an arithmetic progression with common difference of 2.  If the initial term of an arithmetic progression is    a  1     subscript  a  1    a_{1}   and the common difference of successive members is d , then the n th term of the sequence (    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   ) is given by:         a   n   =    a  1   +    (   n  -  1   )   d     ,       subscript  a  n      subscript  a  1       n  1   d      \ a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d,     and in general         a   n   =    a  m   +    (   n  -  m   )   d     .       subscript  a  n      subscript  a  m       n  m   d      \ a_{n}=a_{m}+(n-m)d.     A finite portion of an arithmetic progression is called a finite arithmetic progression and sometimes just called an arithmetic progression. The sum of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series .  The behavior of the arithmetic progression depends on the common difference d . If the common difference is:   Positive, the members (terms) will grow towards positive infinity .  Negative, the members (terms) will grow towards negative infinity.   Sum        2   +   5   +   8   +   11   +   14   =   40     14   +   11   +   8   +   5   +   2   =   40        16   +   16   +   16   +   16   +   16   =   80      Computation of the sum 2 + 5 + 8 + 11 + 14. When the sequence is reversed and added to itself term by term, the resulting sequence has a single repeated value in it, equal to the sum of the first and last numbers (2 + 14 = 16). Thus 16 × 5 = 80 is twice the sum.     The sum of the members of a finite arithmetic progression is called an arithmetic series . For example, consider the sum:      2  +  5  +  8  +  11  +  14      2  5  8  11  14    2+5+8+11+14     This sum can be found quickly by taking the number n of terms being added (here 5), multiplying by the sum of the first and last number in the progression (here 2 + 14 = 16), and dividing by 2:       n   (    a  1   +   a  n    )    2        n     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  n     2    \frac{n(a_{1}+a_{n})}{2}     In the case above, this gives the equation:       2  +  5  +  8  +  11  +  14   =    5   (   2  +  14   )    2   =    5  ×  16   2   =  40.          2  5  8  11  14       5    2  14    2            5  16   2        40.     2+5+8+11+14=\frac{5(2+14)}{2}=\frac{5\times 16}{2}=40.     This formula works for any real numbers    a  1     subscript  a  1    a_{1}   and    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   . For example:         (   -   3  2    )   +   (   -   1  2    )   +   1  2    =    3   (    -   3  2    +   1  2    )    2   =   -   3  2     .              3  2        1  2      1  2        3        3  2      1  2     2            3  2       \left(-\frac{3}{2}\right)+\left(-\frac{1}{2}\right)+\frac{1}{2}=\frac{3\left(-%
 \frac{3}{2}+\frac{1}{2}\right)}{2}=-\frac{3}{2}.     Derivation  To derive the above formula, begin by expressing the arithmetic series in two different ways:       S  n   =    a  1   +   (    a  1   +  d   )   +   (    a  1   +   2  d    )   +  ⋯  +   (    a  1   +    (   n  -  2   )   d    )   +   (    a  1   +    (   n  -  1   )   d    )         subscript  S  n      subscript  a  1      subscript  a  1   d      subscript  a  1     2  d    normal-⋯     subscript  a  1       n  2   d       subscript  a  1       n  1   d       S_{n}=a_{1}+(a_{1}+d)+(a_{1}+2d)+\cdots+(a_{1}+(n-2)d)+(a_{1}+(n-1)d)           S  n   =    (    a  n   -    (   n  -  1   )   d    )   +   (    a  n   -    (   n  -  2   )   d    )   +  ⋯  +   (    a  n   -   2  d    )   +   (    a  n   -  d   )   +   a  n     .       subscript  S  n        subscript  a  n       n  1   d       subscript  a  n       n  2   d    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n     2  d       subscript  a  n   d    subscript  a  n      S_{n}=(a_{n}-(n-1)d)+(a_{n}-(n-2)d)+\cdots+(a_{n}-2d)+(a_{n}-d)+a_{n}.     Adding both sides of the two equations, all terms involving d cancel:        2   S  n    =   n   (    a  1   +   a  n    )     .        2   subscript  S  n      n     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  n       \ 2S_{n}=n(a_{1}+a_{n}).     Dividing both sides by 2 produces a common form of the equation:        S  n   =    n  2    (    a  1   +   a  n    )     .       subscript  S  n       n  2      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  n       S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}(a_{1}+a_{n}).     An alternate form results from re-inserting the substitution     a  n   =    a  1   +    (   n  -  1   )   d         subscript  a  n      subscript  a  1       n  1   d      a_{n}=a_{1}+(n-1)d   :        S  n   =    n  2    [    2   a  1    +    (   n  -  1   )   d    ]     .       subscript  S  n       n  2    delimited-[]      2   subscript  a  1        n  1   d        S_{n}=\frac{n}{2}[2a_{1}+(n-1)d].     Furthermore the mean value of the series can be calculated via     S  n   /  n       subscript  S  n   n    S_{n}/n   :        n  ¯   =     a  1   +   a  n    2    .       normal-¯  n        subscript  a  1    subscript  a  n    2     \overline{n}=\frac{a_{1}+a_{n}}{2}.     In 499 AD Aryabhata , a prominent mathematician - astronomer from the classical age of Indian mathematics and Indian astronomy , gave this method in the Aryabhatiya (section 2.18).  Product  The product of the members of a finite arithmetic progression with an initial element a 1 , common differences d , and n elements in total is determined in a closed expression         a  1    a  2   ⋯   a  n    =   d    a  1   d   d   (     a  1   d   +  1   )   d   (     a  1   d   +  2   )   ⋯  d   (      a  1   d   +  n   -  1   )    =    d  n     (    a  1   d   )    n  ¯     =    d  n     Γ   (     a  1   /  d   +  n   )     Γ   (    a  1   /  d   )       ,           subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯   subscript  a  n      d     subscript  a  1   d   d       subscript  a  1   d   1   d       subscript  a  1   d   2   normal-⋯  d         subscript  a  1   d   n   1            superscript  d  n    superscript     subscript  a  1   d    normal-¯  n             superscript  d  n       normal-Γ       subscript  a  1   d   n      normal-Γ     subscript  a  1   d         a_{1}a_{2}\cdots a_{n}=d\frac{a_{1}}{d}d(\frac{a_{1}}{d}+1)d(\frac{a_{1}}{d}+2%
 )\cdots d(\frac{a_{1}}{d}+n-1)=d^{n}{\left(\frac{a_{1}}{d}\right)}^{\overline{%
 n}}=d^{n}\frac{\Gamma\left(a_{1}/d+n\right)}{\Gamma\left(a_{1}/d\right)},     where    x   n  ¯      superscript  x   normal-¯  n     x^{\overline{n}}   denotes the rising factorial and   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   denotes the Gamma function . (Note however that the formula is not valid when     a  1   /  d       subscript  a  1   d    a_{1}/d   is a negative integer or zero.)  This is a generalization from the fact that the product of the progression    1  ×  2  ×  ⋯  ×  n      1  2  normal-⋯  n    1\times 2\times\cdots\times n   is given by the factorial     n  !      n    n!   and that the product      m  ×   (   m  +  1   )   ×   (   m  +  2   )   ×  ⋯  ×   (   n  -  2   )   ×   (   n  -  1   )   ×  n      m    m  1     m  2   normal-⋯    n  2     n  1   n    m\times(m+1)\times(m+2)\times\cdots\times(n-2)\times(n-1)\times n\,\!     for positive integers    m   m   m   and   n   n   n   is given by        n  !     (   m  -  1   )   !    .        n       m  1      \frac{n!}{(m-1)!}.     Taking the example from above, the product of the terms of the arithmetic progression given by a n = 3 + ( n -1)(5) up to the 50th term is        P  50   =    5  50   ⋅    Γ   (    3  /  5   +  50   )     Γ   (   3  /  5   )      ≈   3.78438  ×   10  98     .         subscript  P  50    normal-⋅   superscript  5  50       normal-Γ      3  5   50      normal-Γ    3  5             3.78438   superscript  10  98       P_{50}=5^{50}\cdot\frac{\Gamma\left(3/5+50\right)}{\Gamma\left(3/5\right)}%
 \approx 3.78438\times 10^{98}.     Standard deviation  The standard deviation of any arithmetic progression can be calculated via:      σ  =    |  d  |       (   n  -  1   )    (   n  +  1   )    12         σ      d           n  1     n  1    12       \sigma=|d|\sqrt{\frac{(n-1)(n+1)}{12}}     where   n   n   n   is the number of terms in the progression, and   d   d   d   is the common difference between terms  Intersections  The intersection of any two doubly-infinite arithmetic progressions is either empty or another arithmetic progression, which can be found using the Chinese remainder theorem . If each two progressions in a family of doubly-infinite arithmetic progressions have a non-empty intersection, then there exists a number common to all of them; that is, infinite arithmetic progressions form a Helly family . 1 However, the intersection of infinitely many infinite arithmetic progressions might be a single number rather than itself being an infinite progression.
