   Myrcene synthase      Myrcene synthase   In enzymology , a myrcene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   myrcene + diphosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , geranyl diphosphate , and two products , myrcene and diphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically those carbon-oxygen lyases acting on phosphates. The systematic name of this enzyme class is geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (myrcene-forming) . This enzyme participates in monoterpenoid biosynthesis .
