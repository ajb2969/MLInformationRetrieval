   D-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)      D-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase (NAD(P)+)   In enzymology , a D-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase [NAD(P) + ] () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-arabinose + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-arabinono-1,4-lactone + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are D-arabinose , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are D-arabinono-1,4-lactone , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-arabinose:NAD(P) + 1-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called D-arabinose 1-dehydrogenase [NAD(P) + ] .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
