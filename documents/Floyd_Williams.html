<h1>Floyd Williams</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Floyd Leroy Williams</strong> (born September 20, 1939) is a North American mathematician well known for his work in <a href="Lie_theory" title="wikilink">Lie theory</a> and, most recently, <a href="mathematical_physics" title="wikilink">mathematical physics</a>. In addition to Lie theory, his research interests are in <a href="homological_algebra" title="wikilink">homological algebra</a> and the mathematics of <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a>. He received his B.S.(1962) in Mathematics from <a href="Lincoln_University_of_Missouri" title="wikilink">Lincoln University of Missouri</a>, and later his M.S.(1965) and Ph.D.(1972) from <a href="Washington_University_in_St._Louis" title="wikilink">Washington University in St. Louis</a>. Williams was appointed <a class="uri" href="professor" title="wikilink">professor</a> of mathematics at the <a href="University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst" title="wikilink">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> in 1984, and has been professor <a class="uri" href="emeritus" title="wikilink">emeritus</a> since 2005.</p>
<h2 id="biographical-sketch">Biographical Sketch</h2>

<p>Floyd Williams was born on September 20, 1939, and lived in <a href="Kansas_City,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Kansas City, Missouri</a>. He was raised in extreme <a class="uri" href="poverty" title="wikilink">poverty</a>. His mother told him not to complain about their situation, but rather to have faith in <a class="uri" href="God" title="wikilink">God</a> and work hard. Her advice was taken, and it worked. He eventually was <a class="uri" href="ordained" title="wikilink">ordained</a> in addition to being a <a class="uri" href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>.</p>

<p>However, it was <a class="uri" href="music" title="wikilink">music</a>, not <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, that appealed to him through <a href="high_school" title="wikilink">high school</a>. "In fact," he admits, "mathematics was the only course in which I did not do well." Williams had not thought of going to <a class="uri" href="college" title="wikilink">college</a> until his last week in high school when he was offered a music <a class="uri" href="scholarship" title="wikilink">scholarship</a> at <a href="Lincoln_University_of_Missouri" title="wikilink">Lincoln University of Missouri</a> in <a href="Jefferson_City,_Missouri" title="wikilink">Jefferson City, Missouri</a>.</p>

<p>It was in his sophomore year that he became intrigued by the <a href="theory_of_relativity" title="wikilink">theory of relativity</a>, which turned out to be his main motivation for studying <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. In 1972 he completed his <a class="uri" href="Ph.D." title="wikilink">Ph.D.</a> from <a href="Washington_University" title="wikilink">Washington University</a> where his <a class="uri" href="thesis" title="wikilink">thesis</a> was in the field of <a href="Lie_theory" title="wikilink">Lie theory</a>. He was an <a href="professor" title="wikilink">instructor</a> and <a class="uri" href="lecturer" title="wikilink">lecturer</a> at <a class="uri" href="MIT" title="wikilink">MIT</a> from 1972–1975, before moving to the <a href="University_of_Massachusetts_Amherst" title="wikilink">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a> as an assistant professor in 1975. In 1983 he received an <a href="MRI_grant" title="wikilink">MRI grant</a> to continuing researching in this field, ushering him into the mainstream of mathematics.</p>

<p>As an <a class="uri" href="African-American" title="wikilink">African-American</a> in a field that has had little <a href="minority_group" title="wikilink">minority</a> representation, Williams has felt the sting of <a class="uri" href="discrimination" title="wikilink">discrimination</a> during his career. However, he has been a motivation and role model for many young minorities, encouraging them to enter <a class="uri" href="science" title="wikilink">science</a> and <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>. Williams has helped to set up programs that allow pre-college students and <a class="uri" href="undergraduates" title="wikilink">undergraduates</a> to meet and talk with <a class="uri" href="mathematicians" title="wikilink">mathematicians</a>, <a class="uri" href="scientists" title="wikilink">scientists</a> and <a class="uri" href="engineers" title="wikilink">engineers</a>, most notably at a summer camp run at <a class="uri" href="MIT" title="wikilink">MIT</a>. "All that many of these youngsters see is different courses," he says, "but they want to know what mathematicians do from 8 am to 5 pm. Once <a class="uri" href="minorities" title="wikilink">minorities</a> commit to <a href="Postgraduate_education" title="wikilink">graduate</a> work in <a class="uri" href="science" title="wikilink">science</a> or <a class="uri" href="engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>," he continues, "they need extra help and support for what, for many, is the foreign environment of <a href="graduate_school" title="wikilink">graduate school</a>. Such programs exist at few <a class="uri" href="universities" title="wikilink">universities</a>, but we need more of them."</p>

<p>In 2012 he became a fellow of the <a href="American_Mathematical_Society" title="wikilink">American Mathematical Society</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p>Williams' recent contribution to <a href="quantum_mechanics" title="wikilink">quantum mechanics</a> has been in the area of <a class="uri" href="Nikiforov-Uvarov" title="wikilink">Nikiforov-Uvarov</a> theory of generalized <a href="hypergeometric_differential_equation" title="wikilink">hypergeometric differential equation</a>, used to solve the <a href="Schrödinger_equation" title="wikilink">Schrödinger equation</a> and to obtain the quantization of energies from a single unified point of view. This <a class="uri" href="theory" title="wikilink">theory</a> is developed and is also used to give a uniform approach to the theory of <a href="special_functions" title="wikilink">special functions</a>. This study furthers to connect the modern studies of <a href="pure_mathematics" title="wikilink">pure mathematics</a> with <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a>.</p>
