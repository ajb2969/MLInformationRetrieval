Mannitol-1-phosphatase




Mannitol-1-phosphatase

In enzymology, a mannitol-1-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-mannitol 1-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-mannitol + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-mannitol 1-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are D-mannitol and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannitol-1-phosphate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme is also called mannitol-1-phosphate phosphatase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
