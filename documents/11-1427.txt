Adenylyl-sulfate kinase




Adenylyl-sulfate kinase

In enzymology, an adenylyl-sulfate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + adenylyl sulfate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and adenylyl sulfate, whereas its two products are ADP and 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:adenylyl-sulfate 3'-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include adenylylsulfate kinase (phosphorylating), 5'-phosphoadenosine sulfate kinase, adenosine 5'-phosphosulfate kinase, adenosine phosphosulfate kinase, adenosine phosphosulfokinase, adenosine-5'-phosphosulfate-3'-phosphokinase, and APS kinase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: purine metabolism, selenoamino acid metabolism, and sulfur metabolism.
This enzyme contains an ATP binding P-loop motif.1
