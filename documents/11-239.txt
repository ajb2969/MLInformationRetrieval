Pseudouridylate synthase




Pseudouridylate synthase

In enzymology, a pseudouridylate synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

uracil + D-ribose 5-phosphate 
 
 
 
  pseudouridine 5'-phosphate + H2O
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are uracil and D-ribose 5-phosphate, whereas its two products are pseudouridine 5'-phosphate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is uracil hydro-lyase (adding D-ribose 5-phosphate pseudouridine-5'-phosphate-forming). Other names in common use include pseudouridylic acid synthetase, pseudouridine monophosphate synthetase, 5-ribosyluracil 5-phosphate synthetase, pseudouridylate synthetase, upsilonUMP synthetase, and uracil hydro-lyase (adding D-ribose 5-phosphate). This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism.
