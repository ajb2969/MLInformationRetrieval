Progressive function

In mathematics, a progressive function ƒ ∈ L2(R) is a function whose Fourier transform is supported by positive frequencies only:



It is called super regressive if and only if the time reversed function f(−t) is progressive, or equivalently, if



The complex conjugate of a progressive function is regressive, and vice versa.
The space of progressive functions is sometimes denoted 
 
 
 
 , which is known as the Hardy space of the upper half-plane. This is because a progressive function has the Fourier inversion formula



and hence extends to a holomorphic function on the upper half-plane


by the formula



Conversely, every holomorphic function on the upper half-plane which is uniformly square-integrable on every horizontal line will arise in this manner.
Regressive functions are similarly associated with the Hardy space on the lower half-plane
