   Passive matrix addressing      Passive matrix addressing   Passive matrix addressing is an addressing scheme used in early LCD displays. This is a matrix addressing scheme meaning that only m + n control signals are required to address a m Ã— n display. A pixel in a passive matrix must maintain its state without active driving circuitry until it can be refreshed again.  The signal is divided into a row or select signal and a column or video signal . The select voltage determines the row that is being addressed and all n pixels on a row are addressed simultaneously. When pixels on a row are being addressed, a V sel potential is applied, and all other rows are unselected with a V unsel potential. The video signal or column potential is then applied with a potential for each m columns individually. An on-lighted pixel corresponds to a V on , an off-switched corresponds to a V off potential.  The potential across pixel at selected row i and column j is       V   i  j    =    V   s  e  l    -   V   o  n  |  o  f  f          subscript  V    i  j       subscript  V    s  e  l     subscript  V   fragments  o  n  normal-|  o  f  f       V_{ij}=V_{sel}-V_{on|off}   and       V   i  j    =    V   u  n  s  e  l    -   V   o  n  |  o  f  f          subscript  V    i  j       subscript  V    u  n  s  e  l     subscript  V   fragments  o  n  normal-|  o  f  f       V_{ij}=V_{unsel}-V_{on|off}   for the unselected rows.  Passive matrix addressed displays such as Ferro Liquid Display do not need the switch component of an active matrix display because they have built-in bistability . Technology for electronic paper also has a form of bistability. Displays with bistable pixel elements are addressed with a passive matrix addressing scheme, whereas TFT LCD displays are addressed using active addressing .
