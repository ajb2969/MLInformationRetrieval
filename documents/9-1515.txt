   Robbins constant      Robbins constant   In geometry , Robbins' constant , named after David P. Robbins , is the average distance between two points selected at random within a unit cube . Robbins' constant can be expressed as 1          4  +   17   2     -   6   3    -   7  π    105   +    ln   (   1  +   2    )    5   +    2   ln   (   2  +   3    )     5    .            4    17    2       6    3      7  π    105         1    2     5       2      2    3      5     \frac{4+17\sqrt{2}-6\sqrt{3}-7\pi}{105}+\frac{\ln(1+\sqrt{2})}{5}+\frac{2\ln(2%
 +\sqrt{3})}{5}.     Its numerical value is approximately 2     0.66170718226717623515583.   0.66170718226717623515583.   0.66170718226717623515583.     References    "  Category:Geometry     . ↩  ↩
