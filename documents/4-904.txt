   Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings      Periodic points of complex quadratic mappings   This article describes periodic points of some complex quadratic maps . A map is a formula for computing a value of a variable based on its own previous value or values; a quadratic map is one that involves the previous value raised to the powers one and two; and a complex map is one in which the variable is a complex number . A periodic point of a map is a value of the variable that occurs repeatedly after intervals of a fixed length.  This theory is applied in relation with the theories of Fatou and Julia sets .  Definitions  Let        f  c    (  z  )    =    z  2   +   c           subscript  f  c   z      superscript  z  2   c     f_{c}(z)=z^{2}+c\,     where   z   z   z   and   c   c   c   are complex-valued . (This    f    f   \ f   is the complex quadratic mapping mentioned in the title.) This article explores the periodic points of this mapping - that is, the points that form a periodic cycle when    f    f   \ f   is repeatedly applied to them.        f   c   (  k  )     (  z  )        subscript   superscript  f  k   c   z    \ f^{(k)}_{c}(z)   is the    k    k   \ k   -fold compositions of     f  c      subscript  f  c    f_{c}\,   with itself = iteration of function      f  c      subscript  f  c    f_{c}\,   or,         f   c   (  k  )     (  z  )    =    f  c    (    f  c   (   k  -  1   )     (  z  )    )           subscript   superscript  f  k   c   z      subscript  f  c      subscript   superscript  f    k  1    c   z      \ f^{(k)}_{c}(z)=f_{c}(f^{(k-1)}_{c}(z))     Periodic points of a complex quadratic mapping of period     p    p   \ p   are points    z    z   \ z   of the dynamical plane such that :       z   :     f  c   (  p  )     (  z  )    =  z      normal-:  z       subscript   superscript  f  p   c   z   z     \ z:f^{(p)}_{c}(z)=z     where    p    p   \ p   is the smallest positive integer.  We can introduce a new function:         F   p    (  z  ,  f  )    =     f  c   (  p  )     (  z  )    -  z          subscript  F  p    z  f         subscript   superscript  f  p   c   z   z     \ F_{p}(z,f)=f^{(p)}_{c}(z)-z     so periodic points are zeros of function      F   p    (  z  ,  f  )        subscript  F  p    z  f     \ F_{p}(z,f)   :       z   :     F  p    (  z  ,  f  )    =  0      normal-:  z       subscript  F  p    z  f    0     \ z:F_{p}(z,f)=0     which is a polynomial of degree     =   2  p       absent   superscript  2  p     \ =2^{p}     Stability of periodic points (orbit) - multiplier    The multiplier ( or eigenvalue, derivative )     m   (  f  ,   z  0   )    =   λ         m   f   subscript  z  0     λ    m(f,z_{0})=\lambda\,   of rational map    f    f   f\,   at fixed point     z  0      subscript  z  0    z_{0}\,   is defined as :       m   (  f  ,   z  0   )    =  λ  =   {        f  c  ′    (   z  0   )    ,       if   z  0    ≠  ∞         1    f  c  ′    (   z  0   )     ,       if   z  0    =  ∞               m   f   subscript  z  0     λ        cases     superscript   subscript  f  c   normal-′    subscript  z  0        if   subscript  z  0        1     superscript   subscript  f  c   normal-′    subscript  z  0         if   subscript  z  0          m(f,z_{0})=\lambda=\begin{cases}f_{c}^{\prime}(z_{0}),&\mbox{if }z_{0}\neq%
 \infty\\
 \frac{1}{f_{c}^{\prime}(z_{0})},&\mbox{if }z_{0}=\infty\end{cases}     where     f  c  ′    (   z  0   )        superscript   subscript  f  c   normal-′    subscript  z  0     f_{c}^{\prime}(z_{0})\,   is first derivative of     f   c     subscript  f  c    \ f_{c}   with respect to    z    z   z\,   at     z  0      subscript  z  0    z_{0}\,   .  Because the multiplier is the same at all periodic points, it can be called a multiplier of the periodic orbit .  The multiplier is:   a complex number ,  invariant under conjugation of any rational map at its fixed point 1  used to check stability of periodic (also fixed) points with stability index     a  b  s   (  λ  )       a  b  s  λ    abs(\lambda)\,      A periodic point is : 2   attracting when     a  b  s   (  λ  )    <   1         a  b  s  λ   1    abs(\lambda)<1\,     super-attracting when     a  b  s   (  λ  )    =   0         a  b  s  λ   0    abs(\lambda)=0\,     attracting but not super-attracting when    0  <   a  b  s   (  λ  )    <   1         0    a  b  s  λ        1     0      indifferent when     a  b  s   (  λ  )    =   1         a  b  s  λ   1    abs(\lambda)=1\,     rationally indifferent or parabolic if    a  b  s   (  λ  )       a  b  s  λ    abs(\lambda)\,   is a root of unity  irrationally indifferent if     a  b  s   (  λ  )    =   1         a  b  s  λ   1    abs(\lambda)=1\,   but multiplier is not a root of unity   repelling when     a  b  s   (  λ  )    >   1         a  b  s  λ   1    abs(\lambda)>1\,      Where do periodic points belong?   attracting is always in Fatou set  repelling is in the Julia set  Indifferent fixed points may be in one or the other. 3 Parabolic periodic point is in Julia set.   Period-1 points (fixed points)  Finite fixed points  Let us begin by finding all finite points left unchanged by 1 application of   f   f   f   . These are the points that satisfy       f   c    (  z  )    =  z         subscript  f  c   z   z    \ f_{c}(z)=z   . That is, we wish to solve        z  2   +  c   =   z          superscript  z  2   c   z    z^{2}+c=z\,     which can be rewritten          z   2   -  z   +  c   =  0.           superscript  z  2   z   c   0.    \ z^{2}-z+c=0.     Since this is an ordinary quadratic equation in 1 unknown, we can apply the standard quadratic solution formula . Look in any standard mathematics textbook, and you will find that there are two solutions of       A    x  2    +   B  x   +  C   =  0          A   superscript  x  2      B  x   C   0    \ Ax^{2}+Bx+C=0   are given by      x  =     -  B   ±     B  2   -   4  A  C       2  A        x     plus-or-minus    B        superscript  B  2     4  A  C        2  A      x=\frac{-B\pm\sqrt{B^{2}-4AC}}{2A}     In our case, we have     A  =  1   ,    B  =   -  1    ,   C  =  c       formulae-sequence    A  1    formulae-sequence    B    1      C  c      A=1,B=-1,C=c   , so we will write       α  1   =    1  -    1  -   4  c      2        subscript  α  1       1      1    4  c      2     \alpha_{1}=\frac{1-\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}   and      α  2   =    1  +    1  -   4  c      2    .       subscript  α  2       1      1    4  c      2     \alpha_{2}=\frac{1+\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}.   So for    c  ∈   C  ∖   [   1  /  4   ,   +  inf   ]        c    C     1  4     infimum       c\in C\setminus[1/4,+\inf]   we have two finite fixed points     α  1      subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}\,   and     α  2      subscript  α  2    \alpha_{2}\,   .  Since       α  1   =    1  2   -  m        subscript  α  1       1  2   m     \alpha_{1}=\frac{1}{2}-m   and     α  2   =    1  2   +  m        subscript  α  2       1  2   m     \alpha_{2}=\frac{1}{2}+m   where    m  =     1  -   4  c     2       m        1    4  c     2     m=\frac{\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}     then      α  1   +   α  2    =   1          subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2    1    \alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=1\,   .  It means that fixed points are symmetrical around    z  =   1  /   2        z    1  2     z=1/2\,   .  (Figure)  This image shows fixed points (both repelling)   Complex dynamics    Here different notation is commonly used: 4       α  c   =    1  -    1  -   4  c      2        subscript  α  c       1      1    4  c      2     \alpha_{c}=\frac{1-\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}   with multiplier     λ   α  c    =   1  -     1  -   4  c            subscript  λ   subscript  α  c      1      1    4  c        \lambda_{\alpha_{c}}=1-\sqrt{1-4c}\,     and       β  c   =    1  +    1  -   4  c      2        subscript  β  c       1      1    4  c      2     \beta_{c}=\frac{1+\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}   with multiplier     λ   β  c    =   1  +     1  -   4  c            subscript  λ   subscript  β  c      1      1    4  c        \lambda_{\beta_{c}}=1+\sqrt{1-4c}\,     Using Viète's formulas one can show that:        α  c   +   β  c    =   -   B  A    =  1           subscript  α  c    subscript  β  c        B  A         1     \alpha_{c}+\beta_{c}=-\frac{B}{A}=1     Since derivative with respect to z is :        P  c  ′    (  z  )    =    d   d  z     P  c    (  z  )    =   2  z            superscript   subscript  P  c   normal-′   z       d    d  z     subscript  P  c   z          2  z      P_{c}^{\prime}(z)=\frac{d}{dz}P_{c}(z)=2z     then         P  c  ′    (   α  c   )    +    P  c  ′    (   β  c   )     =    2   α  c    +   2   β  c     =   2   (    α  c   +   β  c    )    =   2              superscript   subscript  P  c   normal-′    subscript  α  c       superscript   subscript  P  c   normal-′    subscript  β  c         2   subscript  α  c      2   subscript  β  c            2     subscript  α  c    subscript  β  c          2     P_{c}^{\prime}(\alpha_{c})+P_{c}^{\prime}(\beta_{c})=2\alpha_{c}+2\beta_{c}=2(%
 \alpha_{c}+\beta_{c})=2\,     It implies that     P  c      subscript  P  c    P_{c}\,   can have at most one attractive fixed point.  This points are distinguished by the facts that:        β  c      subscript  β  c    \beta_{c}\,   is :  the landing point of external ray for angle=0 for    c  ∈   M  ∖   {   1  4   }        c    M     1  4       c\in M\setminus\left\{\frac{1}{4}\right\}     the most repelling fixed point, belongs to Julia set,  the one on the right ( whenever fixed point are not symmetrical around the real axis), it is the extreme right point for connected Julia sets (except for cauliflower). 5        α  c      subscript  α  c    \alpha_{c}\,   is:  landing point of several rays  is :  attracting when c is in main cardioid of Mandelbrot set, then it is in interior of Filled-in Julia set, it means belongs to Fatou set ( strictly to basin of attraction of finite fixed point )  parabolic at the root point of the limb of Mandelbrot set  repelling for other c values     Special cases  An important case of the quadratic mapping is    c  =  0      c  0    c=0   . In this case, we get     α  1   =  0       subscript  α  1   0    \alpha_{1}=0   and     α  2   =  1       subscript  α  2   1    \alpha_{2}=1   . In this case, 0 is a superattractive fixed point , and 1 belongs to the Julia set .  Only one fixed point  We might wonder what value   c   c   c   should have to cause     α  1   =   α  2        subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2     \alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}   . The answer is that this will happen exactly when     1  -   4  c    =  0        1    4  c    0    1-4c=0   . This equation has 1 solution    c  =   1  /  4       c    1  4     c=1/4   (in which case,     α  1   =   α  2   =   1  /  2          subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2          1  2      \alpha_{1}=\alpha_{2}=1/2   ). This is interesting, since    c  =   1  /  4       c    1  4     c=1/4   is the largest positive, purely real value for which a finite attractor exists.  Infinite fixed point  We can extend complex plane    ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   to Riemann sphere (extended complex plane)     ℂ  ^     normal-^  ℂ    \mathbb{\hat{C}}   by adding infinity       ℂ  ^   =   ℂ  ∪   {  ∞  }         normal-^  ℂ     ℂ        \mathbb{\hat{C}}=\mathbb{C}\cup\{\infty\}     and extend polynomial      f  c      subscript  f  c    f_{c}\,   such that      f  c    (  ∞  )    =   ∞          subscript  f  c        f_{c}(\infty)=\infty\,     Then infinity is :   superattracting  fixed point of polynomial      f  c      subscript  f  c    f_{c}\,    6         f  c    (  ∞  )    =  ∞  =    f  c   -  1     (  ∞  )             subscript  f  c              subscript   superscript  f    1    c        f_{c}(\infty)=\infty=f^{-1}_{c}(\infty)\,     Period-2 cycles  (Figure)  Bifurcation from period 1 to 2 for complex quadratic map   Suppose next that we wish to look at period-2 cycles . That is, we want to find two points    β  1     subscript  β  1    \beta_{1}   and    β  2     subscript  β  2    \beta_{2}   such that      f  c    (   β  1   )    =   β  2          subscript  f  c    subscript  β  1     subscript  β  2     f_{c}(\beta_{1})=\beta_{2}   , and      f  c    (   β  2   )    =   β  1          subscript  f  c    subscript  β  2     subscript  β  1     f_{c}(\beta_{2})=\beta_{1}   .  Let us start by writing      f  c    (    f  c    (   β  n   )    )    =   β  n          subscript  f  c      subscript  f  c    subscript  β  n      subscript  β  n     f_{c}(f_{c}(\beta_{n}))=\beta_{n}   , and see where trying to solve this leads.         f  c    (    f  c    (  z  )    )    =     (    z  2   +  c   )   2   +  c   =    z  4   +   2   z  2   c   +   c  2   +  c    .           subscript  f  c      subscript  f  c   z       superscript     superscript  z  2   c   2   c           superscript  z  4     2   superscript  z  2   c    superscript  c  2   c      f_{c}(f_{c}(z))=(z^{2}+c)^{2}+c=z^{4}+2z^{2}c+c^{2}+c.\,     Thus, the equation we wish to solve is actually        z  4   +   2  c   z  2     -  z   +   c  2   +  c   =  0             superscript  z  4     2  c   superscript  z  2     z    superscript  c  2   c   0    z^{4}+2cz^{2}-z+c^{2}+c=0   .  This equation is a polynomial of degree 4, and so has 4 (possibly non-distinct) solutions. However , actually, we already know 2 of the solutions. They are    α  1     subscript  α  1    \alpha_{1}   and    α  2     subscript  α  2    \alpha_{2}   , computed above. It is simple to see why this is; if these points are left unchanged by 1 application of   f   f   f   , then clearly they will be unchanged by 2 applications (or more).  Our 4th-order polynomial can therefore be factored in 2 ways :  First method        (   z  -   α  1    )    (   z  -   α  2    )    (   z  -   β  1    )    (   z  -   β  2    )    =   0.           z   subscript  α  1      z   subscript  α  2      z   subscript  β  1      z   subscript  β  2     0.    (z-\alpha_{1})(z-\alpha_{2})(z-\beta_{1})(z-\beta_{2})=0.\,     This expands directly as         x  4   -   A   x  3     +   B   x  2     -   C  x    +  D   =  0               superscript  x  4     A   superscript  x  3       B   superscript  x  2       C  x    D   0    x^{4}-Ax^{3}+Bx^{2}-Cx+D=0   (note the alternating signs), where      D  =    α  1    α  2    β  1     β  2         D     subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2    subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2      D=\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\beta_{1}\beta_{2}\,         C  =     α  1    α  2    β  1    +    α  1    α  2    β  2    +    α  1    β  1    β  2    +    α  2    β  1     β  2          C       subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2    subscript  β  1       subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2    subscript  β  2       subscript  α  1    subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2       subscript  α  2    subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2       C=\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\beta_{1}+\alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}\beta_{2}+\alpha_{1}\beta_%

A     subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2    subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2      A=\alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}+\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}.\,     We already have 2 solutions, and only need the other 2. This is as difficult as solving a quadratic polynomial. In particular, note that        α  1   +   α  2    =     1  -    1  -   4  c      2   +    1  +    1  -   4  c      2    =    1  +  1   2   =  1           subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2          1      1    4  c      2       1      1    4  c      2             1  1   2        1     \alpha_{1}+\alpha_{2}=\frac{1-\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}+\frac{1+\sqrt{1-4c}}{2}=\frac{1+%
 1}{2}=1     and         α  1    α  2    =     (   1  -    1  -   4  c      )    (   1  +    1  -   4  c      )    4   =     1  2   -    (    1  -   4  c     )   2    4   =     1  -  1   +   4  c    4   =    4  c   4   =  c   .           subscript  α  1    subscript  α  2          1      1    4  c        1      1    4  c       4             superscript  1  2    superscript      1    4  c     2    4              1  1     4  c    4            4  c   4        c     \alpha_{1}\alpha_{2}=\frac{(1-\sqrt{1-4c})(1+\sqrt{1-4c})}{4}=\frac{1^{2}-(%
 \sqrt{1-4c})^{2}}{4}=\frac{1-1+4c}{4}=\frac{4c}{4}=c.     Adding these to the above, we get    D  =   c   β  1    β  2        D    c   subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2      D=c\beta_{1}\beta_{2}   and    A  =   1  +   β  1   +   β  2        A    1   subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2      A=1+\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}   . Matching these against the coefficients from expanding   f   f   f   , we get      D  =   c   β  1    β  2    =    c  2   +  c         D    c   subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2            superscript  c  2   c      D=c\beta_{1}\beta_{2}=c^{2}+c   and    A  =   1  +   β  1   +   β  2    =  0.        A    1   subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2         0.     A=1+\beta_{1}+\beta_{2}=0.     From this, we easily get :      β  1    β  2    =   c  +  1          subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2      c  1     \beta_{1}\beta_{2}=c+1   and      β  1   +   β  2    =   -  1          subscript  β  1    subscript  β  2      1     \beta_{1}+\beta_{2}=-1   .  From here, we construct a quadratic equation with      A  ′   =  1   ,    B  =  1   ,   C  =   c  +  1        formulae-sequence     superscript  A  normal-′   1    formulae-sequence    B  1     C    c  1       A^{\prime}=1,B=1,C=c+1   and apply the standard solution formula to get       β  1   =     -  1   -     -  3   -   4  c      2        subscript  β  1         1         3     4  c      2     \beta_{1}=\frac{-1-\sqrt{-3-4c}}{2}   and      β  2   =     -  1   +     -  3   -   4  c      2    .       subscript  β  2         1         3     4  c      2     \beta_{2}=\frac{-1+\sqrt{-3-4c}}{2}.     Closer examination shows (the formulas are a tad messy) that :        f  c    (   β  1   )    =   β  2          subscript  f  c    subscript  β  1     subscript  β  2     f_{c}(\beta_{1})=\beta_{2}   and      f  c    (   β  2   )    =   β  1          subscript  f  c    subscript  β  2     subscript  β  1     f_{c}(\beta_{2})=\beta_{1}     meaning these two points are the two halves of a single period-2 cycle.  Second method of factorization          (    z  2   +  c   )   2   +  c   -  z   =    (     z  2   +  c   -  z   )    (    z  2   +  z  +  c  +  1   )             superscript     superscript  z  2   c   2   c   z          superscript  z  2   c   z      superscript  z  2   z  c  1      (z^{2}+c)^{2}+c-z=(z^{2}+c-z)(z^{2}+z+c+1)\,     The roots of the first factor are the two fixed points     z   1  ,  2       subscript  z   1  2     z_{1,2}\,   . They are repelling outside the main cardioid.  The second factor has two roots        z   3  ,  4    =    -   1  2    ±    (    -   3  4    -  c   )    1  2      .       subscript  z   3  4     plus-or-minus      1  2     superscript        3  4    c     1  2       z_{3,4}=-\frac{1}{2}\pm(-\frac{3}{4}-c)^{\frac{1}{2}}.\,     These two roots form period-2 orbit. 7  Special cases  Again, let us look at    c  =  0      c  0    c=0   . Then       β  1   =     -  1   -   i   3     2        subscript  β  1         1     i    3     2     \beta_{1}=\frac{-1-i\sqrt{3}}{2}   and     β  2   =     -  1   +   i   3     2        subscript  β  2         1     i    3     2     \beta_{2}=\frac{-1+i\sqrt{3}}{2}     both of which are complex numbers. By doing a little algebra, we find     |   β  1   |   =   |   β  2   |   =  1           subscript  β  1       subscript  β  2         1     |\beta_{1}|=|\beta_{2}|=1   . Thus, both these points are "hiding" in the Julia set. Another special case is    c  =   -  1       c    1     c=-1   , which gives     β  1   =  0       subscript  β  1   0    \beta_{1}=0   and     β  2   =   -  1        subscript  β  2     1     \beta_{2}=-1   . This gives the well-known superattractive cycle found in the largest period-2 lobe of the quadratic Mandelbrot set.  Cycles for period>2  There is no general solution in radicals to polynomial equations of degree five or higher, so it must be computed using numerical methods .  References  Further reading   Alan F.
