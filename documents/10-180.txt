   Separable algebra      Separable algebra   In mathematics, a separable algebra is a kind of semisimple algebra . It is a generalization to associative algebras of the notion of a separable field extension .  Definition and First Properties  Let K be a field . An associative K -algebra A is said to be separable if for every field extension     L  /  K      L  K    \scriptstyle L/K   the algebra    A   ⊗  K   L      subscript  tensor-product  K   A  L    \scriptstyle A\otimes_{K}L   is semisimple.  There is a classification theorem for separable algebras: separable algebras are the same as finite products of matrix algebras over division algebras whose centers are finite dimensional separable field extensions of the field K . If K is a perfect field --- for example a field of characteristic zero, or a finite field, or an algebraically closed field --- then every extension of K is separable. As a result, if K is a perfect field, separable algebras are the same as finite products of matrix algebras over division algebras whose centers are finite-dimensional field extensions of the field K . In other words, if K is a perfect field, there is no difference between a separable algebra over K and a finite-dimensional semisimple algebra over K .  There are a several equivalent characterizations of separable algebras. First, an algebra A is separable if and only if there exists an element      p  =    ∑   i  =  1   n     x  i   ⊗   y  i         p    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    tensor-product   subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i       p=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\otimes y_{i}     in the enveloping algebra 1      A  e   =   A   ⊗  K    A  op         superscript  A  e     subscript  tensor-product  K   A   superscript  A  op      A^{e}=A\otimes_{K}A^{\rm op}   such that        ∑   i  =  1   n     x  i    y  i     =   1  A         superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i      subscript  1  A     \sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}y_{i}=1_{A}     and ap = pa for all a in A . Such an element p is called a separability idempotent , since it satisfies     p  2   =  p       superscript  p  2   p    p^{2}=p   . A generalized theorem of Maschke shows these this characterization of separable algebras is equivalent to the definition given above.  Second, an algebra A is separable if and only if it is projective when considered as a left module of    A  e     superscript  A  e    A^{e}   in the usual way. 2  Third, an algebra A is separable if and only if it is flat when considered as a right module of    A  e     superscript  A  e    A^{e}   in the usual (but perhaps not quite standard) way. See Aguiar's note below for more details.  Furthermore, a result of Eilenberg and Nakayama has that any separable algebra can be given the structure of a symmetric Frobenius algebra . Since the underlying vector space of a Frobenius algebra is isomorphic to its dual, any Frobenius algebra is necessarily finite dimensional, and so the same is true for separable algebras.  A separable algebra is said to be strongly separable if there exists a separability idempotent that is symmetric , meaning      e  =    ∑   i  =  1   n     x  i   ⊗   y  i     =    ∑   i  =  1   n     y  i   ⊗   x  i           e    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    tensor-product   subscript  x  i    subscript  y  i            superscript   subscript     i  1    n    tensor-product   subscript  y  i    subscript  x  i        e=\sum_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\otimes y_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}y_{i}\otimes x_{i}     An algebra is strongly separable if and only if its trace form is nondegenerate, thus making the algebra into a special Frobenius algebra.  Commutative separable algebras  If    L  /  K      L  K    \scriptstyle L/K   is a field extension, then L is separable as an associative K -algebra if and only if the extension of fields is separable . If L/K has primitive element    a   a   a   with irreducible polynomial     p   (  x  )    =    (   x  -  a   )     ∑   i  =  0    n  -  1      b  i    x  i            p  x       x  a     superscript   subscript     i  0      n  1       subscript  b  i    superscript  x  i        p(x)=(x-a)\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}b_{i}x^{i}   , then a separability idempotent is given by     ∑   i  =  0    n  -  1      a  i    ⊗  K     b  i     p  ′    (  a  )          superscript   subscript     i  0      n  1      subscript  tensor-product  K    superscript  a  i      subscript  b  i      superscript  p  normal-′   a       \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}a^{i}\otimes_{K}\frac{b_{i}}{p^{\prime}(a)}   . The tensorands are dual bases for the trace map: if     σ  1   ,  …  ,   σ  n       subscript  σ  1   normal-…   subscript  σ  n     \sigma_{1},\ldots,\sigma_{n}   are the distinct K-monomorphisms of L into an algebraic closure of K, the trace mapping Tr of L into K is defined by Tr(x) =     ∑   i  =  1   n     σ  i    (  x  )        superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  σ  i   x     \sum_{i=1}^{n}\sigma_{i}(x)   . The trace map and its dual bases make explicit L as a Frobenius algebra over K.  Examples  If K is a field and G is a finite group such that the order of G is invertible in K , then the group ring  K [ G ] is a separable K -algebra. A separability idempotent is given by     1   o   (  G  )       ∑   g  ∈  G     g   ⊗  K    g   -  1            1    o  G      subscript     g  G      subscript  tensor-product  K   g   superscript  g    1        \frac{1}{o(G)}\sum_{g\in G}g\otimes_{K}g^{-1}   .  Separable extensions for noncommutative rings  Let R be an associative ring with unit 1, and S a subring of R containing 1. Notice that an R-R-bimodule (see module theory and homological algebra ) restricts to an S-S-bimodule. The ring extension R over S is said to be a separable extension if all short exact sequences of R-R-bimodules that are split as R-S-bimodules also split as R-R-bimodules. For example, the multiplication mapping m     R   ⊗  S   R   →  R     normal-→    subscript  tensor-product  S   R  R   R    R\otimes_{S}R\rightarrow R   given by     m   (    ∑  i     r  i    ⊗  S    t  i     )    =    ∑  i     r  i    t  i           m    subscript   i     subscript  tensor-product  S    subscript  r  i    subscript  t  i        subscript   i      subscript  r  i    subscript  t  i       m(\sum_{i}r_{i}\otimes_{S}t_{i})=\sum_{i}r_{i}t_{i}   is an R-R-bimodule epimorphism, which is split as an R-S-bimodule epi by the right inverse mapping    R  →   R   ⊗  S   R      normal-→  R    subscript  tensor-product  S   R  R     R\rightarrow R\otimes_{S}R   given by    r  ↦   r  ⊗  1      maps-to  r   tensor-product  r  1     r\mapsto r\otimes 1   . If R is a separable extension over S, then the multiplication mapping is split as an R-R-bimodule epi, so there is a right inverse s of m satisfying for s(1) := e, re = er for all r in R, and m(e) = 1. Conversely, if such an element (called a separability element in the tensor-square) exists, one shows by a judicious use of this element (like Maschke, applying its components within and without the splitting maps) that R is a separable extension of S.  Equivalently, the relative Hochschild cohomology groups     H  n    (  R  ,  S  ;  M  )        superscript  H  n    R  S  M     H^{n}(R,S;M)   of (R,S) in any coefficient bimodule M is zero for n > 0. Examples of separable extensions are many including first separable algebras where R = separable algebra and S = 1 times the ground field. More interestingly, any ring R with elements a and b satisfying ab = 1, but ba different from 1, is a separable extension over the subring S generated by 1 and bRa.  An interesting theorem in the area is that of J. Cuadra that a separable Hopf-Galois extension R | S has finitely generated natural S-module R. A fundamental fact about a separable extension R | S is that it is left or right semisimple extension: a short exact sequence of left or right R-modules that is split as S-modules, is split as R-modules. In terms of G. Hochschild's relative homological algebra, one says that all R-modules are relative (R,S)-projective. Usually relative properties of subrings or ring extensions, such as the notion of separable extension, serve to promote theorems that say that the over-ring shares a property of the subring. For example, a separable extension R of a semisimple algebra S has R semisimple, which follows from the preceding discussion.  There is the celebrated Jans theorem that a finite group algebra A over a field of characteristic p is of finite representation type if and only if its Sylow p-subgroup is cyclic: the clearest proof is to note this fact for p-groups, then note that the group algebra is a separable extension of its Sylow p-subgroup algebra B as the index is coprime to the characteristic. The separability condition above will imply every finitely generated A-module M is isomorphic to a direct summand in its restricted, induced module. But if B has finite representation type, the restricted module is uniquely a direct sum of multiples of finitely many indecomposables, which induce to a finite number of constituent indecomposable modules of which M is a direct sum. Hence A is of finite representation type if B is. The converse if proven by a similar argument noting that every subgroup algebra B is a B-bimodule direct summand of a group algebra A.
