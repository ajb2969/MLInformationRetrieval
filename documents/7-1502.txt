Minkowski plane

In mathematics, a Minkowski plane (named after Hermann Minkowski) is one of the Benz planes: Möbius plane, Laguerre plane and Minkowski plane.
Classical real Minkowski plane
 Applying the pseudo-euclidean distance 
 
 
 
  on two points 
 
 
 
  (instead of the euclidean one) we get the geometry of hyperbolas, because a pseudoeuclidean circle 
 
 
 
  is a hyperbola with midpoint 
 
 
 
 .
By a rotation of 45° the pseudo-euclidean distance can be rewritten as 
 
 
 
 . Now the hyperbolas have asymptotes parallel to the coordinate axes.
The following completion (see Möbius and Laguerre planes) homogenizes the geometry of hyperbolas:


 
 , the set of points,









\cup \{(b,\infty),(\infty,c)\} \ | \ a,b,c \in \R, a\ne 0\}, the set of cycles.
The incidence structure

 
  is called the classical real Minkowski plane.
The set of points consists of 
 
 
 
 , two copies of 
 
 
 
  and the point 
 
 
 
 .
Any line 
 
 
 
  is completed by point 
 
 
 
 , any hyperbola 
 
 
 
  by the two points 
 
 
 
  (see figure).
Two points 
 
 
 
  can not be connected by a cycle if and only if 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
We define: Two points 
 
 
 
  are (+)-parallel (
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
  and (−)-parallel (
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
 .
 Both these relations are equivalence relations on the set of points.
Two points 
 
 
 
  are called parallel (
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
From the definition above we find:
Lemma:
:*For any pair of non parallel points 
 
 
 
  there is exactly one point 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
:*For any point 
 
 
 
  and any cycle 
 
 
 
  there are exactly two points 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
:*For any three points 
 
 
 
 , pairwise non parallel, there is exactly one cycle 
 
 
 
  that contains 
 
 
 
 .
:*For any cycle 
 
 
 
 , any point 
 
 
 
  and any point 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  there exists exactly one cycle 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
touches

 
  at point P.
Like the classical Möbius and Laguerre planes Minkowski planes can be described as the geometry of plane sections of a suitable quadric. But in this case the quadric lives in projective 3-space: The classical real Minkowski plane is isomorphic to the geometry of plane sections of a hyperboloid of one sheet (not degenerated quadric of index 2).
The axioms of a Minkowski plane
Let be 
 
 
 
  an incidence structure with the set 
 
 
 
  of points, the set 
 
 
 
  of cycles and two equivalence relations 
 
 
 
  ((+)-parallel) and 
 
 
 
  ((−)-parallel) on set 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
  we define: 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . An equivalence class 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is called (+)-generator and (−)-generator, respectively. (For the space model of the classical Minkowski plane a generator is a line on the hyperboloid.)
 Two points 
 
 
 
  are called parallel (
 
 
 
 ) if 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
An incidence structure 
 
 
 
  is called Minkowski plane if the following axioms hold:


C1: For any pair of non parallel points 
 
 
 
  there is exactly one point 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
C2: For any point 
 
 
 
  and any cycle 
 
 
 
  there are exactly two points 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
C3: For any three points 
 
 
 
 , pairwise non parallel, there is exactly one cycle 
 
 
 
  which contains 
 
 
 
 .
C4: For any cycle 
 
 
 
 , any point 
 
 
 
  and any point 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  there exists exactly one cycle 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
touches

 
  at point 
 
 
 
 .
C5: Any cycle contains at least 3 points. There is at least one cycle 
 
 
 
  and a point 
 
 
 
  not in 
 
 
 
 .

For investigations the following statements on parallel classes (equivalent to C1, C2 respectively) are advantageous.

C1′: For any two points 
 
 
 
  we have 
 
 
 
 .
 
C2′: For any point 
 
 
 
  and any cycle 
 
 
 
  we have
 
 
 
 .
 

First consequences of the axioms are
Lemma: For a Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  the following is true

a) Any point is contained in at least one cycle.
 
b) Any generator contains at least 3 points.
 
c) Two points can be connected by a cycle if and only if they are non parallel.
 

Analogously to Möbius and Laguerre planes we get the connection to the linear geometry via the residues.
For a Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  we define the local structure


 
  and call it the residue at point P.
For the classical Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  is the real affine plane 
 
 
 
 .
An immediate consequence of axioms C1 to C4 and C1′, C2′ are the following two theorems.
Theorem: For a Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  any residue is an affine plane.
Theorem: Let be 
 
 
 
  an incidence structure with two equivalence relations 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on the set 
 
 
 
  of points (see above).


 
  is a Minkowski plane if and only if for any point 
 
 
 
  the residue 
 
 
 
  is an affine plane.
Minimal model

Minkowski plane: minimal model

The minimal model of a Minkowski plane can be established over the set 
 
 
 
  of three elements:











Parallel points:


 
  if and only if 
 
 

 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
 .
Hence
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Finite Minkowski-planes
For finite Minkowski-planes we get from C1′, C2′:
Lemma: Let be 
 
 
 
  a finite Minkowski plane, i.e. 
 
 
 
 . For any pair of cycles 
 
 
 
  and any pair of generators 
 
 
 
  we have: 
 
 
 
 .
This gives rise of the definition:
 For a finite Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  and a cycle 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  we call the integer 
 
 
 
  the order of 
 
 
 
 .
Simple combinatorial considerations yield
Lemma: For a finite Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  the following is true:

a) Any residue (affine plane) has order 
 
 
 
 .
 
b) 
 
 
 
 ,
 
c) 
 
 
 
 .
 

Miquelian Minkowski planes
We get the most important examples of Minkowski planes by generalizing the classical real model: Just replace 
 
 
 
  by an arbitrary field

 
  then we get in any case a Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
 .
Analogously to Möbius and Laguerre planes the Theorem of Miquel is a characteristic property of a Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  .
 Theorem (Miquel): For the Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  the following is true:

If for any 8 pairwise not parallel points 
 
 
 
  which can be assigned to the vertices of a cube such that the points in 5 faces correspond to concyclical quadruples than the sixth quadruple of points is concyclical, too.
 

(For a better overview in the figure there are circles drawn instead of hyperbolas.)
Theorem (Chen): Only a Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  satisfies the theorem of Miquel.
Because of the last theorem 
 
 
 
  is called a miquelian Minkowski plane.
Remark: The minimal model of a Minkowski plane is miquelian.

It is isomorphic to the Minkowski plane 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  (field 
 
 
 
 ).
 

An astonishing result is
Theorem (Heise): Any Minkowski plane of even order is miquelian.
Remark: A suitable stereographic projection shows
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the geometry of the plane sections on a hyperboloid of one sheet (quadric of index 2) in projective 3-space over field 
 
 
 
 .
Remark: There are a lot of Minkowski planes which are not miquelian (s. weblink below). But there are no "ovoidal Minkowski" planes, in difference to Möbius and Laguerre planes. Because any quadratic set of index 2 in projective 3-space is a quadric (see quadratic set).
