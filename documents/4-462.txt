   Abstract simplicial complex      Abstract simplicial complex   (Figure)  A geometrical representation of an abstract simplicial complex that is not a valid simplicial complex .   In mathematics , an abstract simplicial complex is a purely combinatorial description of the geometric notion of a simplicial complex , consisting of a family of non-empty finite sets closed under the operation of taking non-empty subsets . 1 In the context of matroids and greedoids , abstract simplicial complexes are also called independence systems . 2  Definitions  A family    Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   of non-empty finite  subsets of a universal set  S is an abstract simplicial complex if, for every set   X   X   X   in   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   , and every non-empty subset    Y  ‚äÇ  X      Y  normal-‚äÇ  X    Y‚äÇX   ,   Y   Y   Y   also belongs to   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   .  The finite sets that belong to   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   are called faces of the complex, and a face   Y   Y   Y   is said to belong to another face   X   X   X   if    Y  ‚äÇ  X      Y  normal-‚äÇ  X    Y‚äÇX   , so the definition of an abstract simplicial complex can be restated as saying that every face of a face of a complex   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is itself a face of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   . The vertex set of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is defined as     V   (  Œî  )    =   ‚à™  Œî         V  normal-Œî     normal-‚à™  normal-Œî     V(Œî)=‚à™Œî   , the union of all faces of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   . The elements of the vertex set are called the vertices of the complex. So for every vertex v of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   , the set { v } is a face of the complex. The maximal faces of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   (i.e., faces that are not subsets of any other faces) are called facets of the complex. The dimension of a face    X   X   X   in   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is defined as     d  i  m   (  X  )    =    |  X  |   ‚àí  1         d  i  m  X       X   normal-‚àí  1     dim(X)=|X|‚àí1   : faces consisting of a single element are zero-dimensional, faces consisting of two elements are one-dimensional, etc. The dimension of the complex     d  i  m   (  Œî  )       d  i  m  normal-Œî    dim(Œî)   is defined as the largest dimension of any of its faces, or infinity if there is no finite bound on the dimension of the faces.  The complex   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is said to be finite if it has finitely many faces, or equivalently if its vertex set is finite. Also,   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is said to be pure if it is finite-dimensional (but not necessarily finite) and every facet has the same dimension. In other words,   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is pure if    d  i  m   (  Œî  )       d  i  m  normal-Œî    dim(Œî)   is finite and every face is contained in a facet of dimension    d  i  m   (  Œî  )       d  i  m  normal-Œî    dim(Œî)   .  One-dimensional abstract simplicial complexes are mathematically equivalent to simple  undirected graphs : the vertex set of the complex can be viewed as the vertex set of a graph, and the two-element facets of the complex correspond to undirected edges of a graph. In this view, one-element facets of a complex correspond to isolated vertices that do not have any incident edges.  A subcomplex of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is a simplicial complex L such that every face of L belongs to   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   ; that is,    L  ‚äÇ  Œî      L  normal-‚äÇ  normal-Œî    L‚äÇŒî   and L is a simplicial complex. A subcomplex that consists of all of the subsets of a single face of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is often called a simplex of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   . (However, some authors use the term "simplex" for a face or, rather ambiguously, for both a face and the subcomplex associated with a face, by analogy with the non-abstract (geometric) simplicial complex terminology. To avoid ambiguity, we do not use in this article the term "simplex" for a face in the context of abstract complexes.)  The d-skeleton of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   is the subcomplex of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   consisting of all of the faces of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   that have dimension at most d . In particular, the 1-skeleton is called the underlying graph of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   . The 0-skeleton of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   can be identified with its vertex set, although formally it is not quite the same thing (the vertex set is a single set of all of the vertices, while the 0-skeleton is a family of single-element sets).  The link of a face   Y   Y   Y   in   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   , often denoted    Œî  /  Y      normal-Œî  Y    Œî/Y   or , is the subcomplex of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   defined by        Œî  /  Y   :=   {   X  ‚àà  Œî   ‚à£     X  ‚à©  Y   =  ‚àÖ   ,    X  ‚à™  Y   ‚àà  Œî    }    .     assign    normal-Œî  Y    conditional-set    X  normal-Œî    formulae-sequence      X  Y         X  Y   normal-Œî       \Delta/Y:=\{X\in\Delta\mid X\cap Y=\varnothing,\,X\cup Y\in\Delta\}.     Note that the link of the empty set is   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   itself.  Given two abstract simplicial complexes,   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   and   Œì   normal-Œì   Œì   , a simplicial map is a function   f   f   f   that maps the vertices of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   to the vertices of Œì and that has the property that for any face   X   X   X   of   Œî   normal-Œî   Œî   , the image set    f   (  X  )       f  X    f(X)   is a face of   Œì   normal-Œì   Œì   .  Geometric realization  We can associate to an abstract simplicial complex K a topological space | K |, called its geometric realization , which is a simplicial complex . The construction goes as follows.  First, define | K | as a subset of consisting of functions    t  :    S  ‚Üí  0   ,  11      normal-:  t     S  normal-‚Üí  0   11     t:S‚Üí0,11   satisfying the two conditions:        ‚àë   s  ‚àà  S     t  s    =  1        subscript     s  S     subscript  t  s    1    \sum_{s\in S}t_{s}=1          {   s  ‚àà  S   :    t  s   >  0   }   ‚àà  Œî       conditional-set    s  S      subscript  t  s   0    normal-Œî    \{s\in S:t_{s}>0\}\in\Delta   Now think of as the direct limit of where A ranges over finite subsets of S , and give the induced topology . Now give | K | the subspace topology.  Alternatively, let   ùí¶   ùí¶   \mathcal{K}   denote the category whose objects are the faces of   K   K   K   and whose morphisms are inclusions. Next choose a total order on the vertex set of   K   K   K   and define a functor F from   ùí¶   ùí¶   \mathcal{K}   to the category of topological spaces as follows. For any face    X  ‚àà  K      X  normal-‚àà  K    X‚ààK   of dimension n , let Œî n }} be the standard n -simplex. The order on the vertex set then specifies a unique bijection between the elements of   X   X   X   and vertices of , ordered in the usual way . If    Y  ‚äÇ  X      Y  normal-‚äÇ  X    Y‚äÇX   is a face of dimension    F   (  Y  )   ‚Üí  F   (  X  )       F  Y  normal-‚Üí  F  X    F(Y)‚ÜíF(X)     We can then define the geometric realization | K | as the colimit of the functor F . More specifically | K | is the quotient space of the disjoint union      y  ‚àà  F   (  Y  )       y  normal-‚àà  F  Y    y‚ààF(Y)     by the equivalence relation which identifies a point    F   (  Y  )   ‚Üí  F   (  X  )       F  Y  normal-‚Üí  F  X    F(Y)‚ÜíF(X)   with its image under the map    Y  ‚äÇ  X      Y  normal-‚äÇ  X    Y‚äÇX   , for every inclusion    X  ‚àà  K      X  normal-‚àà  K    X‚ààK   .  If K is finite, then we can describe | K | more simply. Choose an embedding of the vertex set of K as an affinely independent subset of some Euclidean space of sufficiently high dimension N . Then any face    n  +  1      n  1    n+1   can be identified with the geometric simplex in spanned by the corresponding embedded vertices. Take | K | to be the union of all such simplices.  If K is the standard combinatorial n -simplex, then | K | can be naturally identified with .  Examples   As an example, let V be a finite subset of S of cardinality    n  ‚â§  8      n  normal-‚â§  8    n‚â§8   and let K be the power set of V . Then K is called a combinatorial  n - simplex with vertex set V . If K is called the standard combinatorial n -simplex.    The clique complex of an undirected graph has a simplex for each clique (complete subgraph) of the given graph. Clique complexes form the prototypical example of flag complexes , complexes with the property that every set of elements that pairwise belong to simplexes of the complex is itself a simplex.    In the theory of partially ordered sets ("posets"), the order complex of a poset is the set of all finite chains. Its homology groups and other topological invariants contain important information about the poset.    The Vietoris‚ÄìRips complex is defined from any metric space M and distance Œ¥ by forming a simplex for every finite subset of M with diameter at most Œ¥. It has applications in homology theory , hyperbolic groups , image processing , and mobile ad hoc networking . It is another example of a flag complex.   Enumeration  The number of abstract simplicial complexes on up to n elements is one less than the n th Dedekind number . These numbers grow very rapidly, and are known only for   n   n   n   ; they are (starting with n = 0):   1, 2, 5, 19, 167, 7580, 7828353, 2414682040997, 56130437228687557907787 . This corresponds to the number of nonempty antichains of subsets of an $n$ set.   The number of abstract simplicial complexes on exactly n labeled elements is given by the sequence "1, 2, 9, 114, 6894, 7785062, 2414627396434, 56130437209370320359966" , starting at n = 1. This corresponds to the number of antichain covers of a labeled n -set; there is a clear bijection between antichain covers of an n -set and simplicial complexes on n elements described in terms of their maximal faces.  The number of abstract simplicial complexes on exactly n unlabeled elements is given by the sequence "1, 2, 5, 20, 180, 16143"  , starting at n = 1.
