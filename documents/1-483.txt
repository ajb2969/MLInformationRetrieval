   Hilbert's basis theorem      Hilbert's basis theorem   In mathematics , specifically commutative algebra , Hilbert's basis theorem says that a polynomial ring over a Noetherian ring is Noetherian.  Statement  If   R   R   R   a ring, let    R   [  X  ]       R   delimited-[]  X     R[X]   denote the ring of polynomials in the indeterminate   X   X   X   over   R   R   R   . Hilbert proved that if   R   R   R   is "not too large", in the sense that if   R   R   R   is Noetherian, the same must be true for    R   [  X  ]       R   delimited-[]  X     R[X]   . Formally,   Hilbert's Basis Theorem. If   R   R   R   is a Noetherian ring, then    R   [  X  ]       R   delimited-[]  X     R[X]   is a Noetherian ring.    Corollary. If   R   R   R   is a Noetherian ring, then    R   [   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   ]       R    subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n      R[X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}]   is a Noetherian ring.   This can be translated into algebraic geometry as follows: every algebraic set over a field can be described as the set of common roots of finitely many polynomial equations.  proved the theorem (for the special case of polynomial rings over a field) in the course of his proof of finite generation of rings of invariants.  Hilbert produced an innovative proof by contradiction using mathematical induction ; his method does not give an algorithm to produce the finitely many basis polynomials for a given ideal: it only shows that they must exist. One can determine basis polynomials using the method of Gröbner bases .  Proof   Theorem. If   R   R   R   is a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring , then the polynomial ring     R   [  X  ]       R   delimited-[]  X     R[X]   is also a left (resp. right) Noetherian ring.   Remark. We will give two proofs, in both only the "left" case is considered, the proof for the right case is similar.  First Proof  Suppose    𝔞  ⊆   R   [  X  ]        𝔞    R   delimited-[]  X      \mathfrak{a}\subseteq R[X]   were a non-finitely generated left-ideal. Then by recursion (using the axiom of dependent choice ) there is a sequence    {   f  0   ,   f  1   ,  …  }      subscript  f  0    subscript  f  1   normal-…    \{f_{0},f_{1},\ldots\}   of polynomials such that if    𝔟  n     subscript  𝔟  n    \mathfrak{b}_{n}   is the left ideal generated by     f  0   ,  …  ,   f   n  -  1        subscript  f  0   normal-…   subscript  f    n  1      f_{0},\ldots,f_{n-1}   then    f  n     subscript  f  n    f_{n}   in    𝔞  ∖   𝔟  n       𝔞   subscript  𝔟  n     \mathfrak{a}\setminus\mathfrak{b}_{n}   is of minimal degree. It is clear that    {   deg   (   f  0   )    ,   deg   (   f  1   )    ,  …  }      degree   subscript  f  0     degree   subscript  f  1    normal-…    \{\deg(f_{0}),\deg(f_{1}),\ldots\}   is a non-decreasing sequence of naturals. Let    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   be the leading coefficient of    f  n     subscript  f  n    f_{n}   and let   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   be the left ideal in   R   R   R   generated by     a  0   ,   a  1   ,  …      subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1   normal-…    a_{0},a_{1},\ldots   . Since   R   R   R   is Noetherian the chain of ideals     (   a  0   )   ⊂   (   a  0   ,   a  1   )   ⊂    (   a  0   ,   a  1   ,   a  2   )   …          subscript  a  0     subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1             subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    normal-…      (a_{0})\subset(a_{0},a_{1})\subset(a_{0},a_{1},a_{2})\ldots   must terminate. Thus    𝔟  =   (   a  0   ,  …  ,   a   N  -  1    )       𝔟    subscript  a  0   normal-…   subscript  a    N  1       \mathfrak{b}=(a_{0},\ldots,a_{N-1})   for some integer   N   N   N   . So in particular,      g  ∈   𝔟  N       g   subscript  𝔟  N     g\in\mathfrak{b}_{N}   ; moreover,     f  N   ∉   𝔟  N        subscript  f  N    subscript  𝔟  N     f_{N}\notin\mathfrak{b}_{N}   . However,      f  N   -  g   ∈   𝔞  ∖   𝔟  N           subscript  f  N   g     𝔞   subscript  𝔟  N      f_{N}-g\in\mathfrak{a}\setminus\mathfrak{b}_{N}   , which means that    f  N     subscript  f  N    f_{N}   has degree less than    𝔞  ⊆   R   [  X  ]        𝔞    R   delimited-[]  X      \mathfrak{a}\subseteq R[X]   , contradicting the minimality.  Second Proof  Let   𝔟   𝔟   \mathfrak{b}   be a left-ideal. Let   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   be the set of leading coefficients of members of   R   R   R   . This is obviously a left-ideal over   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , and so is finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of     f  0   ,  …  ,   f   N  -  1        subscript  f  0   normal-…   subscript  f    N  1      f_{0},\ldots,f_{N-1}   ; say   d   d   d   . Let    {   deg   (   f  0   )    ,  …  ,   deg   (   f   N  -  1    )    }      degree   subscript  f  0    normal-…   degree   subscript  f    N  1       \{\deg(f_{0}),\ldots,\deg(f_{N-1})\}   be the maximum of the set    𝔟  k     subscript  𝔟  k    \mathfrak{b}_{k}   , and let   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   be the set of leading coefficients of members of     ≤  k      absent  k    {}\leq k   , whose degree is    𝔟  k     subscript  𝔟  k    \mathfrak{b}_{k}   . As before, the   R   R   R   are left-ideals over   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , and so are finitely generated by the leading coefficients of finitely many members of      f  0   (  k  )    ,  ⋯  ,   f    N   (  k  )    -  1    (  k  )     ,      subscript   superscript  f  k   0   normal-⋯   subscript   superscript  f  k      superscript  N  k   1      f^{(k)}_{0},\cdots,f^{(k)}_{N^{(k)}-1},   , say       ≤  k      absent  k    {}\leq k     with degrees     𝔞  *   ⊆   R   [  X  ]         superscript  𝔞      R   delimited-[]  X      \mathfrak{a}^{*}\subseteq R[X]   . Now let    𝔞  ⊆   𝔞  *       𝔞   superscript  𝔞      \mathfrak{a}\subseteq\mathfrak{a}^{*}   be the left-ideal generated by      h  ∈   𝔞  ∖   𝔞  *        h    𝔞   superscript  𝔞       h\in\mathfrak{a}\setminus\mathfrak{a}^{*}   and claim also   a   a   a   . Suppose for the sake of contradiction this is not so. Then let     deg   (  h  )    ≥  d       degree  h   d    \deg(h)\geq d   be of minimal degree, and denote its leading coefficient by    a  ∈  𝔟      a  𝔟    a\in\mathfrak{b}   .   Case 1    a  =    ∑  j     u  j    a  j         a    subscript   j      subscript  u  j    subscript  a  j       a=\sum_{j}u_{j}a_{j}   . Regardless of this condition, we have    f  j     subscript  f  j    f_{j}   , so is a left-linear combination           h  0   ≜    ∑  j     u  j    X    deg   (  h  )    -   deg   (   f  j   )       f  j      ,     normal-≜   subscript  h  0     subscript   j      subscript  u  j    superscript  X     degree  h    degree   subscript  f  j       subscript  f  j       h_{0}\triangleq\sum_{j}u_{j}X^{\deg(h)-\deg(f_{j})}f_{j},         of the coefficients of the   h   h   h   . Consider          h  0   ∈   𝔞  *        subscript  h  0    superscript  𝔞      h_{0}\in\mathfrak{a}^{*}         which has the same leading term as    h  ∉   𝔞  *       h   superscript  𝔞      h\notin\mathfrak{a}^{*}   ; moreover     h  -   h  0    ∈   𝔞  ∖   𝔞  *          h   subscript  h  0      𝔞   superscript  𝔞       h-h_{0}\in\mathfrak{a}\setminus\mathfrak{a}^{*}   while     deg   (   h  -   h  0  ′    )    <   deg   (  h  )         degree    h   subscript   superscript  h  normal-′   0      degree  h     \deg(h-h^{\prime}_{0})<\deg(h)   . Therefore     deg   (  h  )    =  k  <  d         degree  h   k       d     \deg(h)=k   and    a  ∈   𝔟  k       a   subscript  𝔟  k     a\in\mathfrak{b}_{k}   , which contradicts minimality.    Case 2    a  =    ∑  j     u  j    a  j   (  k  )          a    subscript   j      subscript  u  j    subscript   superscript  a  k   j       a=\sum_{j}u_{j}a^{(k)}_{j}   . Then    f  j   (  k  )      subscript   superscript  f  k   j    f^{(k)}_{j}   so is a left-linear combination           h  0   ≜    ∑  j     u  j    X    deg   (  h  )    -   deg   (   f  j   (  k  )    )       f  j   (  k  )       ,     normal-≜   subscript  h  0     subscript   j      subscript  u  j    superscript  X     degree  h    degree   subscript   superscript  f  k   j       subscript   superscript  f  k   j       h_{0}\triangleq\sum_{j}u_{j}X^{\deg(h)-\deg(f^{(k)}_{j})}f^{(k)}_{j},         of the leading coefficients of the    𝔞  =   𝔞  *       𝔞   superscript  𝔞      \mathfrak{a}=\mathfrak{a}^{*}   . Considering        X   X   X         we yield a similar contradiction as in Case 1 .   Thus our claim holds, and   R   R   R   which is finitely generated.  Note that the only reason we had to split into two cases was to ensure that the powers of    R   [   X  0   ,  …  ,   X   n  -  1    ]       R    subscript  X  0   normal-…   subscript  X    n  1       R[X_{0},\ldots,X_{n-1}]   multiplying the factors, were non-negative in the constructions.  Applications  Let    R  n     superscript  R  n    R^{n}   be a Noetherian commutative ring. Hilbert's basis theorem has some immediate corollaries.   By induction we see that    𝔞  ⊂   R   [   X  0   ,  …  ,   X   n  -  1    ]        𝔞    R    subscript  X  0   normal-…   subscript  X    n  1        \mathfrak{a}\subset R[X_{0},\ldots,X_{n-1}]   will also be Noetherian.  Since any affine variety over   A   A   A   (i.e. a locus-set of a collection of polynomials) may be written as the locus of an ideal   R   R   R   and further as the locus of its generators, it follows that every affine variety is the locus of finitely many polynomials — i.e. the intersection of finitely many hypersurfaces .  If    A  ≃    R   [   X  0   ,  …  ,   X   n  -  1    ]    /  𝔞      similar-to-or-equals  A      R    subscript  X  0   normal-…   subscript  X    n  1      𝔞     A\simeq R[X_{0},\ldots,X_{n-1}]/\mathfrak{a}   is a finitely-generated   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   -algebra, then we know that   𝔞   𝔞   \mathfrak{a}   , where    𝔞  =   (   p  0   ,  …  ,   p   N  -  1    )       𝔞    subscript  p  0   normal-…   subscript  p    N  1       \mathfrak{a}=(p_{0},\ldots,p_{N-1})   is an ideal. The basis theorem implies that   A   A   A   must be finitely generated, say $\mathfrak a = (p_0,\dotsc, p_{N-1})$ , i.e. $A$ is finitely presented .
