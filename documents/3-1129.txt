   Injective object      Injective object   In mathematics , especially in the field of category theory , the concept of injective object is a generalization of the concept of injective module . This concept is important in homotopy theory and in theory of model categories . The dual notion is that of a projective object .  General Definition  Let   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   be a category and let   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   be a class of morphisms of   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   .  An object   Q   Q   Q   of   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   is said to be    ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}    -injective if for every morphism    f  :   A  →  Q      normal-:  f   normal-→  A  Q     f:A\to Q   and every morphism    h  :   A  →  B      normal-:  h   normal-→  A  B     h:A\to B   in   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   there exists a morphism    g  :   B  →  Q      normal-:  g   normal-→  B  Q     g:B\to Q   extending (the domain of)   f   f   f   , i.e.     g  h   =  f        g  h   f    gh=f   . In other words,   Q   Q   Q   is injective iff any   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   -morphism into   Q   Q   Q   extends (via composition on the left) to a morphism into   Q   Q   Q   .  The morphism   g   g   g   in the above definition is not required to be uniquely determined by   h   h   h   and   f   f   f   .  In a locally small category, it is equivalent to require that the hom functor     H  o   m  ℭ    (  -  ,  Q  )       H  o   subscript  m  ℭ     Q     Hom_{\mathfrak{C}}(-,Q)   carries   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   -morphisms to epimorphisms (surjections).  The classical choice for   ℋ   ℋ   \mathcal{H}   is the class of monomorphisms , in this case, the expression injective object is used.  Abelian case  The abelian case was the original framework for the notion of injectivity (and still the most important one). If   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   is an abelian category , an object A of   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   is injective iff its hom functor Hom C (–, A ) is exact .  Let      0  →  A  →  B  →  C  →  0       normal-→  0  A    normal-→    B    normal-→    C    normal-→    0     0\to A\to B\to C\to 0   be an exact sequence in   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   such that A is injective. Then the sequence splits and B is injective if and only if C is injective. 1  Enough injectives  Let   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   be a category, H a class of morphisms of   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   ; the category   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   is said to have enough H-injectives if for every object X of   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   , there exist a H -morphism from X to an H -injective object.  Injective hull  A H -morphism g in   ℭ   ℭ   \mathfrak{C}   is called H -essential if for any morphism f , the composite fg is in H only if f is in H .  If f is a H -essential H -morphism with a domain X and an H -injective codomain G , G is called an H -injective hull of X . This H -injective hull is then unique up to a noncanonical isomorphism.  Examples   In the category of Abelian groups and group homomorphisms , an injective object is a divisible group .  In the category of modules and module homomorphisms , R -Mod, an injective object is an injective module . R -Mod has injective hulls (as a consequence, R-Mod has enough injectives).  In the category of metric spaces and nonexpansive mappings , Met , an injective object is an injective metric space , and the injective hull of a metric space is its tight span .  In the category of T0 spaces and continuous mappings , an injective object is always a Scott topology on a continuous lattice therefore it is always sober and locally compact .  In the category of simplicial sets , the injective objects with respect to the class of anodyne extensions are Kan complexes .  In the category of partially ordered sets and monotonic functions between posets, the complete lattices form the injective objects for order-embeddings , and the Dedekind–MacNeille completion of a partially ordered set is its injective hull.  One also talks about injective objects in more general categories, for instance in functor categories or in categories of sheaves of O X modules over some ringed space ( X ,O X ).
