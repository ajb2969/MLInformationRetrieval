   Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity      Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity   In algebra , the Brahmagupta–Fibonacci identity or simply Fibonacci's identity (and in fact due to Diophantus of Alexandria ) says that the product of two sums each of two squares is itself a sum of two squares. In other words, the set of all sums of two squares is closed under multiplication. Specifically:       (    a  2   +   b  2    )    (    c  2   +   d  2    )          superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2       superscript  c  2    superscript  d  2      \displaystyle\left(a^{2}+b^{2}\right)\left(c^{2}+d^{2}\right)   For example,         (    1  2   +   4  2    )    (    2  2   +   7  2    )    =    26  2   +   15  2    =    30  2   +   1  2     .             superscript  1  2    superscript  4  2       superscript  2  2    superscript  7  2        superscript  26  2    superscript  15  2            superscript  30  2    superscript  1  2       (1^{2}+4^{2})(2^{2}+7^{2})=26^{2}+15^{2}=30^{2}+1^{2}.\,   The identity is a special case ( n = 2) of Lagrange's identity , and is first found in Diophantus . Brahmagupta proved and used a more general identity (the Brahmagupta identity), equivalent to       (    a  2   +   n   b  2     )    (    c  2   +   n   d  2     )          superscript  a  2     n   superscript  b  2        superscript  c  2     n   superscript  d  2       \displaystyle\left(a^{2}+nb^{2}\right)\left(c^{2}+nd^{2}\right)   showing that the set of all numbers of the form x 2 + y 2 is closed under multiplication.  Both (1) and (2) can be verified by expanding each side of the equation. Also, (2) can be obtained from (1), or (1) from (2), by changing b to − b .  This identity holds in both the ring of integers and the ring of rational numbers , and more generally in any commutative ring .  In the integer case this identity finds applications in number theory for example when used in conjunction with one of Fermat's theorems it proves that the product of a square and any number of primes of the form 4 n + 1 is also a sum of two squares.  History  The identity is actually first found in Diophantus ' Arithmetica (III, 19), of the third century A.D. It was rediscovered by Brahmagupta (598–668), an Indian mathematician and astronomer , who generalized it (to the Brahmagupta identity) and used it in his study of what is now called Pell's equation . His Brahmasphutasiddhanta was translated from Sanskrit into Arabic by Mohammad al-Fazari , and was subsequently translated into Latin in 1126. 1 The identity later appeared in Fibonacci 's Book of Squares in 1225.  Related identities  Analogous identities are Euler's four-square related to quaternions , and Degen's eight-square derived from the octonions which has connections to Bott periodicity . There is also Pfister's sixteen-square identity , though it is no longer bilinear.  Relation to complex numbers  If a , b , c , and d are real numbers , this identity is equivalent to the multiplication property for absolute values of complex numbers namely that:        |   a  +   b  i    |    |   c  +   d  i    |    =   |    (   a  +   b  i    )    (   c  +   d  i    )    |             a    b  i         c    d  i            a    b  i      c    d  i        |a+bi||c+di|=|(a+bi)(c+di)|\,     since         |   a  +   b  i    |    |   c  +   d  i    |    =   |    (    a  c   -   b  d    )   +   i   (    a  d   +   b  c    )     |    ,            a    b  i         c    d  i              a  c     b  d      i      a  d     b  c         |a+bi||c+di|=|(ac-bd)+i(ad+bc)|,\,     by squaring both sides          |   a  +   b  i    |   2     |   c  +   d  i    |   2    =    |    (    a  c   -   b  d    )   +   i   (    a  d   +   b  c    )     |   2    ,         superscript      a    b  i     2    superscript      c    d  i     2     superscript          a  c     b  d      i      a  d     b  c       2     |a+bi|^{2}|c+di|^{2}=|(ac-bd)+i(ad+bc)|^{2},\,     and by the definition of absolute value,         (    a  2   +   b  2    )    (    c  2   +   d  2    )    =     (    a  c   -   b  d    )   2   +    (    a  d   +   b  c    )   2     .           superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2       superscript  c  2    superscript  d  2        superscript      a  c     b  d    2    superscript      a  d     b  c    2      (a^{2}+b^{2})(c^{2}+d^{2})=(ac-bd)^{2}+(ad+bc)^{2}.\,     Interpretation via norms  In the case that the variables a , b , c , and d are rational numbers , the identity may be interpreted as the statement that the norm in the field  Q ( i ) is multiplicative . That is, we have        N   (   a  +   b  i    )    =    a  2   +    b  2   and  N   (   c  +   d  i    )     =    c  2   +   d  2     ,          N    a    b  i        superscript  a  2      superscript  b  2   and  N    c    d  i              superscript  c  2    superscript  d  2       N(a+bi)=a^{2}+b^{2}\text{ and }N(c+di)=c^{2}+d^{2},\,     and also        N   (    (   a  +   b  i    )    (   c  +   d  i    )    )    =   N   (    (    a  c   -   b  d    )   +   i   (    a  d   +   b  c    )     )    =     (    a  c   -   b  d    )   2   +    (    a  d   +   b  c    )   2     .          N      a    b  i      c    d  i        N        a  c     b  d      i      a  d     b  c               superscript      a  c     b  d    2    superscript      a  d     b  c    2       N((a+bi)(c+di))=N((ac-bd)+i(ad+bc))=(ac-bd)^{2}+(ad+bc)^{2}.\,     Therefore the identity is saying that        N   (    (   a  +   b  i    )    (   c  +   d  i    )    )    =     N   (   a  +   b  i    )    ⋅  N    (   c  +   d  i    )     .        N      a    b  i      c    d  i         normal-⋅    N    a    b  i     N     c    d  i       N((a+bi)(c+di))=N(a+bi)\cdot N(c+di).\,     Application to Pell's equation  In its original context, Brahmagupta applied his discovery (the Brahmagupta identity ) to the solution of Pell's equation , namely x 2 − Ny 2 = 1. Using the identity in the more general form         (    x  1  2   -   N   y  1  2     )    (    x  2  2   -   N   y  2  2     )    =     (     x  1    x  2    +   N   y  1    y  2     )   2   -   N    (     x  1    y  2    +    x  2    y  1     )   2      ,           superscript   subscript  x  1   2     N   superscript   subscript  y  1   2        superscript   subscript  x  2   2     N   superscript   subscript  y  2   2         superscript       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      N   subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2     2     N   superscript       subscript  x  1    subscript  y  2       subscript  x  2    subscript  y  1     2       (x_{1}^{2}-Ny_{1}^{2})(x_{2}^{2}-Ny_{2}^{2})=(x_{1}x_{2}+Ny_{1}y_{2})^{2}-N(x_%
 {1}y_{2}+x_{2}y_{1})^{2},\,     he was able to "compose" triples ( x 1 , y 1 , k 1 ) and ( x 2 , y 2 , k 2 ) that were solutions of x 2 − Ny 2 = k , to generate the new triple       (     x  1    x  2    +   N   y  1     y  2      ,     x  1    y  2    +    x  2     y  1      ,    k  1    k  2    )   .          subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2      N   subscript  y  1    subscript  y  2          subscript  x  1    subscript  y  2       subscript  x  2    subscript  y  1        subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2      (x_{1}x_{2}+Ny_{1}y_{2}\,,\,x_{1}y_{2}+x_{2}y_{1}\,,\,k_{1}k_{2}).     Not only did this give a way to generate infinitely many solutions to x 2 − Ny 2 = 1 starting with one solution, but also, by dividing such a composition by k 1 k 2 , integer or "nearly integer" solutions could often be obtained. The general method for solving the Pell equation given by Bhaskara II in 1150, namely the chakravala (cyclic) method , was also based on this identity. 2  See also   Brahmagupta matrix  Indian mathematics  List of Indian mathematicians  Euler's four-square identity   References  External links   Brahmagupta's identity at PlanetMath  Brahmagupta Identity on MathWorld  A Collection of Algebraic Identities   "  Category:Algebra  Category:Elementary algebra  Category:Mathematical identities  Category:Brahmagupta     George G.
