   Laplace formula      Laplace formula   The Laplace formula is a result in fluid mechanics that gives the surface pressure between two continuous media. The surface of separation is really a transitional layer, but it is so thin that in classical mechanics it can be considered a dividing surface between the two media.  Definition  Consider two continuous media (top and bottom) whose surface of separation undergoes a small displacement. If    r  t     subscript  r  t    r_{t}   and    r  b     subscript  r  b    r_{b}   are the principal radii of curvature of the surface in some sample region, then the difference of pressures is       Δ  P   =   α   (    1   r  t    +   1   r  b     )          normal-Δ  P     α      1   subscript  r  t      1   subscript  r  b        \Delta P=\alpha\left(\frac{1}{r_{t}}+\frac{1}{r_{b}}\right)     where   α   α   \alpha   is the surface tension coefficient.
