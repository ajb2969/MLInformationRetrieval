Laplace formula

The Laplace formula is a result in fluid mechanics that gives the surface pressure between two continuous media. The surface of separation is really a transitional layer, but it is so thin that in classical mechanics it can be considered a dividing surface between the two media.
Definition
Consider two continuous media (top and bottom) whose surface of separation undergoes a small displacement. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the principal radii of curvature of the surface in some sample region, then the difference of pressures is



where 
 
 
 
  is the surface tension coefficient.
