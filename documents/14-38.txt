Banach bundle (non-commutative geometry)

In mathematics, a Banach bundle is a fiber bundle over a topological Hausdorff space, such that each fiber has the structure of a Banach space.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a topological Hausdorff space, a (continuous) Banach bundle over 
 
 
 
  is a tuple 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a topological Hausdorff space, and 
 
 
 
  is a continuous, open surjection, such that each fiber

 
  is a Banach space. Which satisfies the following conditions:

The map 
 
 
 
  is continuous for all 
 
 

The operation 
 
 
 
  is continuous
For every 
 
 
 
 , the map 
 
 
 
  is continuous
If 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is a net in 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . Where 
 
 
 
  denotes the zero of the fiber 
 
 
 
 .1

If the map 
 
 
 
  is only upper semi-continuous, 
 
 
 
  is called upper semi-continuous bundle.
Examples
Trivial bundle
Let A be a Banach space, X be a topological Hausdorff space. Define 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  is a Banach bundle, called the trivial bundle
