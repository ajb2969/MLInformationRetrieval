Fejér's theorem

In mathematics, Fejér's theorem, named for Hungarian mathematician Lipót Fejér, states that if f:R → C is a continuous function with period 2π, then the sequence (σn) of Cesàro means of the sequence (sn) of partial sums of the Fourier series of f converges uniformly to f on [-π,π].
Explicitly,


 
  where


 
  and


 
  with Fn being the nth order Fejér kernel.
A more general form of the theorem applies to functions which are not necessarily continuous . Suppose that f is in L1(-π,π). If the left and right limits f(x0±0) of f(x) exist at x0, or if both limits are infinite of the same sign, then



Existence or divergence to infinity of the Cesàro mean is also implied. By a theorem of Marcel Riesz, Fejér's theorem holds precisely as stated if the (C, 1) mean σn is replaced with (C, α) mean of the Fourier series .
