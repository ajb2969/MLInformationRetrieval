   Fejér's theorem      Fejér's theorem   In mathematics, Fejér's theorem , named for Hungarian  mathematician  Lipót Fejér , states that if f : R → C is a continuous function with period 2π, then the sequence (σ n ) of Cesàro means of the sequence ( s n ) of partial sums of the Fourier series of f  converges uniformly to f on [-π,π].  Explicitly,         s  n    (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =   -  n    n     c  k    e   i  k  x       ,         subscript  s  n   x     superscript   subscript     k    n     n      subscript  c  k    superscript  e    i  k  x        s_{n}(x)=\sum_{k=-n}^{n}c_{k}e^{ikx},   where        c  k   =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π    f   (  t  )    e   -   i  k  t     d  t      ,       subscript  c  k       1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π     f  t   superscript  e      i  k  t     d  t       c_{k}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{\pi}f(t)e^{-ikt}dt,   and         σ  n    (  x  )    =    1  n     ∑   k  =  0    n  -  1      s  k    (  x  )      =    1   2  π      ∫   -  π   π    f   (   x  -  t   )    F  n    (  t  )   d  t      ,           subscript  σ  n   x       1  n     superscript   subscript     k  0      n  1       subscript  s  k   x              1    2  π      superscript   subscript     π    π     f    x  t    subscript  F  n   t  d  t        \sigma_{n}(x)=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=0}^{n-1}s_{k}(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int_{-\pi}^{%
 \pi}f(x-t)F_{n}(t)dt,   with F n being the n th order Fejér kernel .  A more general form of the theorem applies to functions which are not necessarily continuous . Suppose that f is in L 1 (-π,π). If the left and right limits f ( x 0 ±0) of f ( x ) exist at x 0 , or if both limits are infinite of the same sign, then         σ  n    (   x  0   )    →    1  2    (    f   (    x  0   +  0   )    +   f   (    x  0   -  0   )     )     .     normal-→     subscript  σ  n    subscript  x  0        1  2       f     subscript  x  0   0      f     subscript  x  0   0        \sigma_{n}(x_{0})\to\frac{1}{2}\left(f(x_{0}+0)+f(x_{0}-0)\right).     Existence or divergence to infinity of the Cesàro mean is also implied. By a theorem of Marcel Riesz , Fejér's theorem holds precisely as stated if the (C, 1) mean σ n is replaced with (C, α) mean of the Fourier series .  References    .
