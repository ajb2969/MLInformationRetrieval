   Subtractor      Subtractor   In electronics , a subtractor can be designed using the same approach as that of an adder . The binary subtraction process is summarized below. As with an adder, in the general case of calculations on multi-bit numbers, three bits are involved in performing the subtraction for each bit of the difference : the minuend (    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   ), subtrahend (    Y  i     subscript  Y  i    Y_{i}   ), and a borrow in from the previous (less significant) bit order position (    B  i     subscript  B  i    B_{i}   ). The outputs are the difference bit (    D  i     subscript  D  i    D_{i}   ) and borrow bit    B   i  +  1      subscript  B    i  1     B_{i+1}   . The subtractor is best understood by considering that the subtrahend and both borrow bits have negative weights, whereas the X and D bits are positive. The operation performed by the subtractor is to rewrite     X  i   -   Y  i   -   B  i        subscript  X  i    subscript  Y  i    subscript  B  i     X_{i}-Y_{i}-B_{i}   (which can take the values -2, -1, 0, or 1) as the sum     -   2   B   i  +  1      +   D  i           2   subscript  B    i  1       subscript  D  i     -2B_{i+1}+D_{i}   .       D  i   =    X  i   ⊕   Y  i   ⊕   B  i         subscript  D  i    direct-sum   subscript  X  i    subscript  Y  i    subscript  B  i      D_{i}=X_{i}\oplus Y_{i}\oplus B_{i}          B   i  +  1    =   X  i   <   (    Y  i   +   B  i    )          subscript  B    i  1     subscript  X  i           subscript  Y  i    subscript  B  i       B_{i+1}=X_{i}<(Y_{i}+B_{i})     Subtractors are usually implemented within a binary adder for only a small cost when using the standard two's complement notation, by providing an addition/subtraction selector to the carry-in and to invert the second operand.       -  B   =    B  ¯   +  1         B      normal-¯  B   1     -B=\bar{B}+1   (definition of two's complement negation)      A  -  B      A  B    \displaystyle A-B     Half subtractor  The half-subtractor is a combinational circuit which is used to perform subtraction of two bits. It has two inputs, X ( minuend ) and Y ( subtrahend ) and two outputs D (difference) and B (borrow). An important point worth mentioning is that the half substractor diagram aside implements (b-a) and not (a-b) as borrow is calculated from equation      B  =    b  ¯   ⋅  a       B   normal-⋅   normal-¯  b   a     B=\overline{b}\cdot a    This important difference should be noticed.  Truth table  The truth table for the half subtractor is given below. 1      X   Y   D   B       0   0   0   0     0   1   1   1     1   0   1   0     1   1   0   0       From the above table one can draw the Karnaugh map for "difference" and "borrow".  So, Logic equations are:      D  =   y  ⊕  x       D   direct-sum  y  x     D=y\oplus x         B  =    x  ¯   ⋅  y       B   normal-⋅   normal-¯  x   y     B=\overline{x}\cdot y     Full subtractor  The full-subtractor is a combinational circuit which is used to perform subtraction of three bits . It has three inputs, X ( minuend ) and Y( subtrahend ) and Z ( subtrahend ) and two outputs D (difference) and B (borrow).
