Acceptance set

In financial mathematics, acceptance set is a set of acceptable future net worth which is acceptable to the regulator. It is related to risk measures.
Mathematical Definition
Given a probability space 
 
 
 
 , and letting 
 
 
 
  be the Lp space in the scalar case and 
 
 
 
  in d-dimensions, then we can define acceptance sets as below.
Scalar Case
An acceptance set is a set 
 
 
 
  satisfying:






 
  such that 
 
 




Additionally if 
 
 
 
  is convex then it is a convex acceptance set
 
And if 
 
 
 
  is a positively homogeneous cone then it is a coherent acceptance set1


Set-valued Case
An acceptance set (in a space with 
 
 
 
  assets) is a set 
 
 
 
  satisfying:



 
  with 
 
 
 
  denoting the random variable that is constantly 1 

 
 -a.s.





 
  is directionally closed in 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 





Additionally, if 
 
 
 
  is convex (a convex cone) then it is called a convex (coherent) acceptance set. 2
Note that 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a constant solvency cone and 
 
 
 
  is the set of portfolios of the 
 
 
 
  reference assets.
Relation to Risk Measures
An acceptance set is convex (coherent) if and only if the corresponding risk measure is convex (coherent). As defined below it can be shown that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Risk Measure to Acceptance Set

If 
 
 
 
  is a (scalar) risk measure then 
 
 
 
  is an acceptance set.
If 
 
 
 
  is a set-valued risk measure then 
 
 
 
  is an acceptance set.

Acceptance Set to Risk Measure

If 
 
 
 
  is an acceptance set (in 1-d) then 
 
 
 
  defines a (scalar) risk measure.
If 
 
 
 
  is an acceptance set then 
 
 
 
  is a set-valued risk measure.

Examples
Superhedging price
The acceptance set associated with the superhedging price is the negative of the set of values of a self-financing portfolio at the terminal time. That is


 
 .
Entropic risk measure
The acceptance set associated with the entropic risk measure is the set of payoffs with positive expected utility. That is


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the exponential utility function.3
