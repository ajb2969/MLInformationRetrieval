   Acceptance set      Acceptance set   In financial mathematics , acceptance set is a set of acceptable future net worth which is acceptable to the regulator . It is related to risk measures .  Mathematical Definition  Given a probability space    (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  ℙ  )     normal-Ω  ℱ  ℙ    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})   , and letting     L  p   =    L  p    (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  ℙ  )         superscript  L  p      superscript  L  p    normal-Ω  ℱ  ℙ      L^{p}=L^{p}(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})   be the Lp space in the scalar case and     L  d  p   =    L  d  p    (  Ω  ,  ℱ  ,  ℙ  )         superscript   subscript  L  d   p      superscript   subscript  L  d   p    normal-Ω  ℱ  ℙ      L_{d}^{p}=L_{d}^{p}(\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})   in d-dimensions, then we can define acceptance sets as below.  Scalar Case  An acceptance set is a set   A   A   A   satisfying:       A  ⊇   L  +  p        subscript   superscript  L  p     A    A\supseteq L^{p}_{+}          A  ∩   L    -  -   p    =  ∅        A   subscript   superscript  L  p     absent         A\cap L^{p}_{--}=\emptyset   such that     L    -  -   p   =   {   X  ∈   L  p    :     ∀  ω   ∈  Ω   ,    X   (  ω  )    <  0    }        subscript   superscript  L  p     absent      conditional-set    X   superscript  L  p     formulae-sequence     for-all  ω   normal-Ω       X  ω   0       L^{p}_{--}=\{X\in L^{p}:\forall\omega\in\Omega,X(\omega)<0\}          A  ∩   L  -  p    =   {  0  }         A   subscript   superscript  L  p       0     A\cap L^{p}_{-}=\{0\}     Additionally if   A   A   A   is convex then it is a convex acceptance set  And if   A   A   A   is a positively homogeneous cone then it is a coherent acceptance set 1    Set-valued Case  An acceptance set (in a space with   d   d   d   assets) is a set    A  ⊆   L  d  p       A   subscript   superscript  L  p   d     A\subseteq L^{p}_{d}   satisfying:       u  ∈   K  M   ⇒   u  1   ∈  A        u   subscript  K  M     normal-⇒      u  1        A     u\in K_{M}\Rightarrow u1\in A   with   1   1   1   denoting the random variable that is constantly 1    ℙ   ℙ   \mathbb{P}   -a.s.      u  ∈   -   int   K  M     ⇒   u  1   ∉  A        u      int   subscript  K  M       normal-⇒      u  1        A     u\in-\mathrm{int}K_{M}\Rightarrow u1\not\in A        A   A   A   is directionally closed in   M   M   M   with     A  +   u  1    ⊆    A    ∀  u    ∈   K  M           A    u  1      A   for-all  u          subscript  K  M      A+u1\subseteq A\;\forall u\in K_{M}          A  +    L  d  p    (  K  )     ⊆  A        A     subscript   superscript  L  p   d   K    A    A+L^{p}_{d}(K)\subseteq A      Additionally, if   A   A   A   is convex (a convex cone ) then it is called a convex (coherent) acceptance set . 2  Note that     K  M   =   K  ∩  M        subscript  K  M     K  M     K_{M}=K\cap M   where   K   K   K   is a constant solvency cone and   M   M   M   is the set of portfolios of the   m   m   m   reference assets.  Relation to Risk Measures  An acceptance set is convex (coherent) if and only if the corresponding risk measure is convex (coherent). As defined below it can be shown that      R   A  R     (  X  )    =   R   (  X  )           subscript  R   subscript  A  R    X     R  X     R_{A_{R}}(X)=R(X)   and     A   R  A    =  A       subscript  A   subscript  R  A    A    A_{R_{A}}=A   .  Risk Measure to Acceptance Set   If   ρ   ρ   \rho   is a (scalar) risk measure then     A  ρ   =   {   X  ∈   L  p    :    ρ   (  X  )    ≤  0   }        subscript  A  ρ    conditional-set    X   superscript  L  p        ρ  X   0      A_{\rho}=\{X\in L^{p}:\rho(X)\leq 0\}   is an acceptance set.  If   R   R   R   is a set-valued risk measure then     A  R   =   {   X  ∈   L  d  p    :   0  ∈   R   (  X  )     }        subscript  A  R    conditional-set    X   subscript   superscript  L  p   d      0    R  X       A_{R}=\{X\in L^{p}_{d}:0\in R(X)\}   is an acceptance set.   Acceptance Set to Risk Measure   If   A   A   A   is an acceptance set (in 1-d) then      ρ  A    (  X  )    =   inf   {   u  ∈  ℝ   :    X  +   u  1    ∈  A   }           subscript  ρ  A   X    infimum   conditional-set    u  ℝ       X    u  1    A       \rho_{A}(X)=\inf\{u\in\mathbb{R}:X+u1\in A\}   defines a (scalar) risk measure.  If   A   A   A   is an acceptance set then      R  A    (  X  )    =   {   u  ∈  M   :    X  +   u  1    ∈  A   }          subscript  R  A   X    conditional-set    u  M       X    u  1    A      R_{A}(X)=\{u\in M:X+u1\in A\}   is a set-valued risk measure.   Examples  Superhedging price  The acceptance set associated with the superhedging price is the negative of the set of values of a self-financing portfolio at the terminal time. That is      A  =   {   -   V  T    :     (   V  t   )    t  =  0   T   is the price of a self-financing portfolio at each time   }       A   conditional-set     subscript  V  T       superscript   subscript   subscript  V  t     t  0    T   is the price of a self-financing portfolio at each time      A=\{-V_{T}:(V_{t})_{t=0}^{T}\text{ is the price of a self-financing portfolio %
 at each time}\}   .  Entropic risk measure  The acceptance set associated with the entropic risk measure is the set of payoffs with positive expected utility . That is      A  =   {   X  ∈    L  p    (  ℱ  )     :    E   [   u   (  X  )    ]    ≥  0   }   =   {   X  ∈    L  p    (  ℱ  )     :    E   [   e   -   θ  X     ]    ≤  1   }         A   conditional-set    X     superscript  L  p   ℱ        E   delimited-[]    u  X     0          conditional-set    X     superscript  L  p   ℱ        E   delimited-[]   superscript  e      θ  X       1       A=\{X\in L^{p}(\mathcal{F}):E[u(X)]\geq 0\}=\{X\in L^{p}(\mathcal{F}):E\left[e%
 ^{-\theta X}\right]\leq 1\}   where    u   (  X  )       u  X    u(X)   is the exponential utility function. 3  References  "  Category:Mathematical finance  Category:Financial risk     ↩  ↩  ↩
