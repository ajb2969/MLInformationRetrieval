   Mevalonate kinase      Mevalonate kinase   Mevalonate kinase is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MVK  gene . 1 2 Mevalonate kinases are found in a wide variety of organisms from bacteria to mammals. This enzyme catalyzes the following reaction: .  Function  Mevalonate is a key intermediate, and mevalonate kinase a key early enzyme, in isoprenoid and sterol synthesis. 3     (Figure)  Mevalonate pathway      Clinical significance  Defects can be associated with hyperimmunoglobulinemia D with recurrent fever . 4  Mevalonate kinase deficiency caused by mutation of this gene results in mevalonic aciduria, a disease characterized psychomotor retardation, failure to thrive, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia and recurrent febrile crises. Defects in this gene also cause hyperimmunoglobulinaemia D and periodic fever syndrome, a disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of fever associated with lymphadenopathy, arthralgia, gastrointestinal dismay and skin rash. 5  See also   Mevalonic aciduria  Mevalonic acid   References  {{-}}  Further reading                        External links     "  Category:EC 2.7.1  Category:Human proteins     ↩  ↩   ↩
