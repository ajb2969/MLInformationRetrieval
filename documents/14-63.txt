   Retina Display      Retina Display   Retina Display is a brand name used by Apple for screens that have a higher pixel density than their previous models. 1 The terms are used for several Apple products, including the iPhone , iPod Touch , iPad , MacBook (2015 version) , MacBook Pro , iPad Mini , iPad Air and iMac . 2  The goal of retina displays is to allow the extremely crisp display of text and images, allowing computer screens to rival the smooth curves and sharpness of printed text and immediacy of photographic prints, while avoiding previous compromises such as specially-designed fonts designed to render well onscreen. 3 4 5 6  Because the typical viewing distance is different, depending on each device's use, the pixels per inch claiming to be of Retina quality can differ, depending on the size of the display, with higher PPI for smaller displays and lower PPI for larger displays. Later device versions have an even higher quality improvement, either counted by an increase in the PPI (the iPhone 6 Plus) and/or by an increase in the number of pixels (the iPhone 6 and 6 Plus, and iMac With Retina 5K Display), thus Apple using the name "Retina HD Display" or "Retina 5K Display".  When an Apple product has a Retina Display, each user interface widget is doubled in width and height to compensate for the smaller pixels. Apple calls this mode HiDPI mode . Apple has applied to register the term "Retina" as a trademark in regard to computers and mobile devices with the United States Patent and Trademark Office , Canadian Intellectual Property Office , and in Jamaica. 7 8 On November 27, 2012 the US Patent and Trademark office approved Apple's application and "Retina" is now a registered trademark for computer equipment.  Models  The displays are manufactured worldwide by different suppliers. Currently, the iPad's display comes from LG Display , 9 while the MacBook Pro, iPhone, and iPod Touch displays are made by LG 10 and Japan Display Inc. 11 There was a shift of display technology from twisted nematic (TN) liquid-crystal displays (LCDs) to in-plane switching (IPS) LCDs starting with the iPhone 4 models.  Apple uses a variety of slightly different terms for retina displays: Retina HD Display on release of the iPhone 6/iPhone 6 Plus in September 2014, and Retina 5K Display on release of the October 2014 iMac (marketed by Apple with a lowercase ' D ' as Retina display , Retina HD display , or Retina 5K display 12 ).  Apple markets the following devices as having a Retina Display, Retina HD Display, or Retina 5K Display:      Model {{cite web   title=Apple – iPod Touch – Technical Specifications   url= http://www.apple.com/ipod-touch/specs.html }} {{cite web   title=Apple – iPhone – Technical Specifications   url= http://www.apple.com/iphone/specs.html }} {{cite web   title=Apple – iPad – Technical Specifications   url= http://www.apple.com/ipad/specs }} {{cite web   title=Apple – MacBook Pro – Technical Specifications   url= http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/specs/ }} {{cite web   title=Apple – iMac – Technical Specifications   url= http://www.apple.com/imac/specs/ }}   Device size   Marketing name   PPI (pixels per inch )   PPCM (pixels per cm )   PPD ( pixels per degree )   Resolution   Number of pixels   Typical viewing distance (in/cm)       Apple Watch 38mm   38mm   Retina Display   326   114   50   272×340   92,480      Apple Watch 42mm   42mm   326   119   52   312×390   121,680     iPhone 4 / 4S and iPod Touch (4th generation)   3.5-inch   326   128   57   960×640   614,400     iPhone 5 / 5C / 5S and iPod Touch (5th generation)   4-inch   | 1136×640   727,040     iPhone 6   4.7-inch   Retina HD Display   1334×750   1,000,500     iPhone 6 Plus   5.5-inch   401   157   70   1920×1080   2,073,600     iPad ( 3rd / 4th generation / Air / Air 2 )   9.7-inch   Retina Display   264   105   69   2048×1536   3,145,728      iPad Mini 2 / 3   7.9-inch   326   128   85     MacBook Pro (3rd generation) 15"   15-inch   220   87   77   2880×1800   5,184,000      MacBook Pro (3rd generation) 13"   13-inch   227   89   79   2560×1600   4,096,000     MacBook (2015) 12"   12-inch   226   88   78   2304×1440   3,317,760     iMac with Retina 5K Display 27"   27-inch   Retina 5K Display   218   86   76   5120×2880   14,745,600     Technical definition  When introducing the iPhone 4 , Steve Jobs said the number of pixels needed for a Retina Display is about 326 PPI for a device held 10 to 12 inches from the eye. 13 One way of expressing this as a unit is pixels-per-degree (PPD) which takes into account both the screen resolution and the distance from which the device is viewed. Based on Jobs' predicted number of 326, the threshold for a Retina Display starts at the PPD value of 57 PPD. 57 PPD means that a tall skinny triangle with a height equal to the viewing distance and a top angle of one degree will have a base on the device's screen that covers 57 pixels. Any display's viewing quality (from phone displays to huge projectors) can be described with this size-independent universal parameter. Note that the PPD parameter is not an intrinsic parameter of the display itself, unlike absolute pixel resolution (e.g. 1920×1080 pixels) or relative pixel density (e.g. 401 PPI), but is dependent on the distance between the display and the eye of the person (or lens of the device) viewing the display; moving the eye closer to the display reduces the PPD, and moving away from it increases the PPD in proportion to the distance. It can be calculated by the formula      2  d  r   tan   (   0.5  ∘   )        2  d  r     superscript  0.5       2dr\tan(0.5^{\circ})   where   d   d   d   is the distance to the screen and   r   r   r   is the resolution of the screen in pixels per unit length.  In practice, thus far Apple has converted a device's display to Retina by doubling the number of pixels in each direction, quadrupling the total resolution. This increase creates a sharper interface at the same physical dimensions. The sole exception to this has been the iPhone 6 Plus, which renders its display at triple the number of pixels in each direction, before down-sampling to a 1080p resolution.  Reception  Reviews of Apple devices with retina displays have generally been positive on technical grounds, with comments describing it as a considerable improvement on earlier screens and praising Apple for driving third-party application support for high-resolution displays more effectively than on Windows. 14 15 16 As is common with Apple, there was also criticism of Apple's higher prices and profit margins. 17 Reviewing the iPhone 4 in 2010, writer Joshua Topolsky commented:   "to our eyes, there has never been a more detailed, clear, or viewable screen on any mobile device. Not only are the colors and blacks deep and rich, but you simply cannot see pixels on the screen. Okay, if you take some macro camera shots or get right up in there you can make them out [but] webpages that would be line after line of pixelated content when zoomed out on a 3GS are completely readable on the iPhone 4, though the text is beyond microscopic." 18   Former Microsoft employee Bill Hill, an expert on font rendering, offered similar comments:   That much resolution is stunning. To see it on a mainstream device like the iPad - rather than a $13,000 exotic monitor - is truly amazing, and something I've been waiting more than a decade to see. It will set a bar for future resolution that every other manufacturer of devices and PCs will have to jump. 19 20   Writer and programmer John Gruber suggested that the arrival of retina displays on computers would trigger a need to redesign interfaces and designs for the new displays:   The sort of rich, data-dense information design espoused by Edward Tufte can now not only be made on the computer screen but also enjoyed on one. Regarding font choices, you not only need not choose a font optimized for rendering on screen, but should not. Fonts optimized for screen rendering look cheap on the retina MacBook Pro — sometimes downright cheesy — in the same way they do when printed in a glossy magazine.   Criticism  Raymond Soneira, president of DisplayMate Technologies, has challenged Apple's claim. He says that the physiology of the human retina is such that there must be at least 477 pixels per inch in a pixelated display for the pixels to become imperceptible to the human eye at a distance of . 21 The astronomer and science blogger Phil Plait notes, however, that, "if you have [better than 20/20 ] eyesight, then at one foot away the iPhone 4S's pixels are resolved. The picture will look pixelated. If you have average eyesight [20/20 vision], the picture will look just fine... So in my opinion, what Jobs said was fine. Soneira, while technically correct, was being picky." 22 Shortly after Soneira's challenge, the Boys of Tech podcast published their own analysis 23 and concluded that Soneira's claim was invalid and that Jobs' claim was correct. This was primarily because Soneira misinterpreted the manner in which the acuity of the human eye can be tested. The retinal neuroscientist Bryan Jones offers a similar analysis of more detail and comes to a similar conclusion: "I'd find Apple’s claims stand up to what the human eye can perceive." 24  Apple fan website CultOfMac stated that the resolution the human eye can discern at 12 inches is 900 PPI, concluding "Apple’s Retina Displays are only about 33% of the way there." 25 On the topic of 20/20 vision, they said "most research suggests that normal vision is actually much better than 20/20. In fact, people with normal vision usually won't see their eyesight degrade to 20/20 until they are 60 or 70 years of age" 26 (confirmed by vision testing experts Precision Vision). 27  CultOfMac also noted that people do not always view displays at a constant distance, and will sometimes move closer, at which point the display could no longer be classed as Retina. 28  See also   Pixel density  Resolution independence   References  "  Category:IPhone  Category:Liquid crystal displays      ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  Claims priority filing date with respect to prior application in Jamaica. ↩  Also cites prior application in Jamaica. ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
