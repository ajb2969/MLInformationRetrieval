2-Amino-4-deoxychorismate dehydrogenase

2-Amino-4-deoxychorismate dehydrogenase (, ADIC dehydrogenase, 2-amino-2-deoxyisochorismate dehydrogenase, SgcG) is an enzyme with system name (2S)-2-amino-4-deoxychorismate:FMN oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2S)-2-amino-4-deoxychorismate + FMN 
 
 
 
  3-(1-carboxyvinyloxy)anthranilate + FMNH2
 

This enzyme participates in the formation of the benzoxazolinate moiety of the enediyne antitumour antibiotic C-1027].
