   Cone (topology)      Cone (topology)   In topology , especially algebraic topology , the cone  CX  of a topological space  X is the quotient space :       C  X   =    (   X  √ó  I   )   /   (   X  √ó   {  0  }    )          C  X       X  I     X   0       CX=(X\times I)/(X\times\{0\})\,     of the product of X with the unit interval  I = [0, 1]. Intuitively we make X into a cylinder and collapse one end of the cylinder to a point .  If X sits inside Euclidean space , the cone on X is homeomorphic to the union of lines from X to another point. That is, the topological cone agrees with the geometric cone when defined. However, the topological cone construction is more general.  Examples   The cone over a point p of the real line is the interval { p } x [0,1].  The cone over two points {0,1} is a "V" shape with endpoints at {0} and {1}.  The cone over an interval I of the real line is a filled-in triangle , otherwise known as a 2-simplex (see the final example).  The cone over a polygon  P is a pyramid with base P .  The cone over a disk is the solid cone of classical geometry (hence the concept's name).  The cone over a circle is the curved surface of the solid cone:          {    (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )   ‚àà   ‚Ñù  3    ‚à£     x  2   +   y  2    =    z  2   and  0   ‚â§  z  ‚â§  1   }   .     conditional-set     x  y  z    superscript  ‚Ñù  3           superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2       superscript  z  2   and  0        z       1      \{(x,y,z)\in\mathbb{R}^{3}\mid x^{2}+y^{2}=z^{2}\mbox{ and }0\leq z\leq 1\}.       This in turn is homeomorphic to the closed disc .    In general, the cone over an n-sphere is homeomorphic to the closed ( n +1)- ball .  The cone over an n - simplex is an ( n +1)-simplex.   Properties  All cones are path-connected since every point can be connected to the vertex point. Furthermore, every cone is contractible to the vertex point by the homotopy   h t ( x , s ) = ( x , (1‚àí t ) s ).   The cone is used in algebraic topology precisely because it embeds a space as a subspace of a contractible space.  When X is compact and Hausdorff (essentially, when X can be embedded in Euclidean space), then the cone CX can be visualized as the collection of lines joining every point of X to a single point. However, this picture fails when X is not compact or not Hausdorff, as generally the quotient topology on CX will be finer than the set of lines joining X to a point.  Reduced cone  If    (  X  ,   x  0   )     X   subscript  x  0     (X,x_{0})   is a pointed space , there is a related construction, the reduced cone , given by       X  √ó   [  0  ,  1  ]    /   (    X  √ó   {  0  }    ‚à™    {   x  0   }   √ó   [  0  ,  1  ]     )         X   0  1        X   0        subscript  x  0     0  1       X\times[0,1]/(X\times\left\{0\right\}\cup\left\{x_{0}\right\}\times[0,1])     With this definition, the natural inclusion    x  ‚Ü¶   (  x  ,  1  )      maps-to  x   x  1     x\mapsto(x,1)   becomes a based map, where we take    (   x  0   ,  0  )      subscript  x  0   0    (x_{0},0)   to be the basepoint of the reduced cone.  Cone functor  The map    X  ‚Ü¶   C  X      maps-to  X    C  X     X\mapsto CX   induces a functor     C  :    ùïã  ùï†  ùï°   ‚Üí   ùïã  ùï†  ùï°       normal-:  C   normal-‚Üí    ùïã  ùï†  ùï°     ùïã  ùï†  ùï°      C:\mathbb{Top}\to\mathbb{Top}   on the category of topological spaces  Top .
