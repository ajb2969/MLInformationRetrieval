Omega Andromedae

Omega Andromedae (ω And, ω Andromedae) is the Bayer designation for a binary star1 system in the northern constellation of Andromeda. Based upon parallax measurements made during the Hipparcos mission, this system is located at a distance of approximately  from Earth. The apparent visual magnitude of Omega Andromedae is +4.83,2 which makes it bright enough to be seen with the naked eye.
The primary component of this system has a stellar classification of F5 IVe.3 The IV luminosity class indicates that it is probably a subgiant star that is in the process of evolving away from the main sequence as the supply of hydrogen at its core becomes exhausted. The measured angular diameter of the primary star is .4 At the estimated distance of this system, this yields a physical size of about 2.2 times the radius of the Sun.5 It is emitting about seven times the luminosity of the Sun from its outer atmosphere at an effective temperature of 6,628 K.6 This heat gives it the yellow-white hued glow of an F-type star.7
In 2008, the companion star was resolved using adaptive optics at the Lick Observatory. Subsequent observations showed the magnitude difference between the two stars is 3.65 ± 0.03 and they are separated by 0.669 arcseconds.8
