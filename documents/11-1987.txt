   Quasi-derivative      Quasi-derivative   In mathematics , the quasi-derivative is one of several generalizations of the derivative of a function between two Banach spaces . The quasi-derivative is a slightly stronger version of the Gâteaux derivative , though weaker than the Fréchet derivative .  Let f : A → F be a continuous function from an open set  A in a Banach space E to another Banach space F . Then the quasi-derivative of f at x 0 ∈ A is a linear transformation  u : E → F with the following property: for every continuous function g : [0,1] → A with g (0)= x 0 such that g ′(0) ∈ E exists,         lim   t  →   0  +        f   (   g   (  t  )    )    -   f   (   x  0   )     t    =   u   (    g  ′    (  0  )    )     .        subscript    normal-→  t   superscript  0            f    g  t      f   subscript  x  0     t      u     superscript  g  normal-′   0      \lim_{t\to 0^{+}}\frac{f(g(t))-f(x_{0})}{t}=u(g^{\prime}(0)).     If such a linear map u exists, then f is said to be quasi-differentiable at x 0 .  Continuity of u need not be assumed, but it follows instead from the definition of the quasi-derivative. If f is Fréchet differentiable at x 0 , then by the chain rule , f is also quasi-differentiable and its quasi-derivative is equal to its Fréchet derivative at x 0 . The converse is true provided E is finite-dimensional. Finally, if f is quasi-differentiable, then it is Gâteaux differentiable and its Gâteaux derivative is equal to its quasi-derivative.
