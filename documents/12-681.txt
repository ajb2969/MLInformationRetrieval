   Slave boson      Slave boson   The Slave Boson method is a method for dealing with models of strongly correlated systems . It is mainly used as an approximation for the Anderson impurity model in the limit that the Coulombic repulsion tends to infinity. However, it has been used for Hubbard models , 1 such as in the theory of the high-Tc  superconductors  It involves coupling the fermion  operators    f   f   f   to a boson field   b   b   b   such that       f  †   →    f  †   b      normal-→   superscript  f  normal-†      superscript  f  normal-†   b     f^{\dagger}\rightarrow f^{\dagger}b     Bibliography   P.
