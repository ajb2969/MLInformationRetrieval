   Diphosphate-purine nucleoside kinase      Diphosphate-purine nucleoside kinase   In enzymology , a diphosphate-purine nucleoside kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   diphosphate + a purine nucleoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phosphate + a purine mononucleotide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are diphosphate and purine nucleoside , whereas its two products are phosphate and purine mononucleotide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is diphosphate:purine nucleoside phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called pyrophosphate-purine nucleoside kinase .
