Uniform boundedness




Uniform boundedness

In mathematics, bounded functions are functions for which there exists a lower bound and an upper bound, in other words, a constant that is larger than the absolute value of any value of this function. If we consider a family of bounded functions, this constant can vary across functions in the family. If it is possible to find one constant that bounds all functions, this family of functions is uniformly bounded.
The uniform boundedness principle in functional analysis provides sufficient conditions for uniform boundedness of a family of operators.
Definition
Real line and complex plane
Let


 
  be a family of functions indexed by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an arbitrary set and 
 
 
 
  is the set of real or complex numbers. We call 
 
 
uniformly bounded if there exists a real number 
 
 
 
  such that



Metric space
In general let 
 
 
 
  be a metric space with metric 
 
 
 
 , then the set


 
  is called uniformly bounded if there exists an element 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  and a real number 
 
 
 
  such that



Examples

Every uniformly convergent sequence of bounded functions is uniformly bounded.


The family of functions 
 
 
 
  defined for real

 
  with 
 
 
 
  traveling through the integers, is uniformly bounded by 1.


The family of derivatives of the above family, 
 
 
 
  is not uniformly bounded. Each 
 
 
 
  is bounded by 
 
 
 
  but there is no real number 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  for all integers
