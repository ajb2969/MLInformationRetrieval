Distributive law between monads

In category theory, an abstract branch of mathematics, distributive laws between monads are a way to express abstractly that two algebraic structures distribute one over the other one.
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two monads on a category C. In general, there is no natural monad structure on the composite functor ST. On the other hand, there is a natural monad structure on the functor ST if there is a distributive law of the monad S over the monad T.
Formally, a distributive law of the monad S over the monad T is a natural transformation


 
  such that the diagrams

          
 
 and 
 

commute.
This law induces a composite monad ST with

as multiplication
 
 
 
 ,
as unit
 
 
 
 .
