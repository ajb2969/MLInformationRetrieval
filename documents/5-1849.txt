Isotropic manifold

In mathematics, an isotropic manifold is a manifold in which the geometry does not depend on directions. Formally, we say that a Riemannian manifold 
 
 
 
  is isotropic if for any point 
 
 
 
  and unit vectors 
 
 
 
 , there is an isometry 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Every isotropic manifold is homogeneous, i.e. for any 
 
 
 
  there is an isometry 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  This can be seen by considering a geodesic 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  and taking the isometry which fixes 
 
 
 
  and maps 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 

Examples
The simply-connected space forms (the n-sphere, hyperbolic space, and 
 
 
 
 ) are isotropic. It is not true in general that any constant curvature manifold is isotropic; for example, the flat torus 
 
 
 
  is not isotropic. This can be seen by noting that any isometry of 
 
 
 
  which fixes a point 
 
 
 
  must lift to an isometry of 
 
 
 
  which fixes a point and preserves 
 
 
 
 ; thus the group of isometries of 
 
 
 
  which fix 
 
 
 
  is discrete. Moreover, it can be seen that no oriented surface with constant curvature and negative Euler characteristic is isotropic.
Moreover, there are isotropic manifolds which do not have constant curvature, such as the complex projective space 
 
 
 
  (
 
 
 
 ) equipped with the Fubini-Study metric.
Further examples of isotropic manifolds are given by the rank one symmetric spaces, including the projective spaces 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , as well as their noncompact hyperbolic analogues.
A manifold can be homogeneous but not isotropic, such as 
 
 
 
  with the product metric.
