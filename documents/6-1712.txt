   Berezinian      Berezinian   In mathematics and theoretical physics , the Berezinian or superdeterminant is a generalization of the determinant to the case of supermatrices . The name is for Felix Berezin . The Berezinian plays a role analogous to the determinant when considering coordinate changes for integration on a supermanifold .  Definition  The Berezinian is uniquely determined by two defining properties:        Ber   (   X  Y   )    =    Ber   (  X  )     Ber   (  Y  )          Ber    X  Y       Ber  X    Ber  Y      \operatorname{Ber}(XY)=\operatorname{Ber}(X)\operatorname{Ber}(Y)          Ber   (   e  X   )    =    e   str   (  X  )           Ber   superscript  e  X     superscript  e    str  normal-X      \operatorname{Ber}(e^{X})=e^{\operatorname{str(X)}}\,      where str( X ) denotes the supertrace of X . Unlike the classical determinant, the Berezinian is defined only for invertible supermatrices.  The simplest case to consider is the Berezinian of a supermatrix with entries in a field  K . Such supermatrices represent linear transformations of a super vector space over K . A particular even supermatrix is a block matrix of the form      X  =   [     A    0      0    D     ]       X    A  0    0  D      X=\begin{bmatrix}A&0\\
 0&D\end{bmatrix}   Such a matrix is invertible if and only if both A and D are invertible matrices over K . The Berezinian of X is given by       Ber   (  X  )    =   det    (  A  )    det    (  D  )    -  1            Ber  X       A     superscript  D    1         \operatorname{Ber}(X)=\det(A)\det(D)^{-1}     For a motivation of the negative exponent see the substitution formula in the odd case.  More generally, consider matrices with entries in a supercommutative algebra  R . An even supermatrix is then of the form      X  =   [     A    B      C    D     ]       X    A  B    C  D      X=\begin{bmatrix}A&B\\
 C&D\end{bmatrix}   where A and D have even entries and B and C have odd entries. Such a matrix is invertible if and only if both A and D are invertible in the commutative ring  R 0 (the even subalgebra of R ). In this case the Berezinian is given by       Ber   (  X  )    =   det    (   A  -   B   D   -  1    C    )    det    (  D  )    -  1            Ber  X         A    B   superscript  D    1    C       superscript  D    1         \operatorname{Ber}(X)=\det(A-BD^{-1}C)\det(D)^{-1}     or, equivalently, by        Ber   (  X  )    =   det    (  A  )    det    (   D  -   C   A   -  1    B    )    -  1        .       Ber  X       A     superscript    D    C   superscript  A    1    B      1         \operatorname{Ber}(X)=\det(A)\det(D-CA^{-1}B)^{-1}.     These formulas are well-defined since we are only taking determinants of matrices whose entries are in the commutative ring R 0 . The matrix      D  -   C   A   -  1     B        D    C   superscript  A    1    B     D-CA^{-1}B\,     is known as the Schur complement of A relative to     [     A    B      C    D     ]   .      A  B    C  D     \begin{bmatrix}A&B\\
 C&D\end{bmatrix}.     An odd matrix X can only be invertible if the number of even dimensions equals the number of odd dimensions. In this case, invertibility of X is equivalent to the invertibility of JX , where       J  =   [     0    I       -  I     0     ]    .      J    0  I      I   0      J=\begin{bmatrix}0&I\\
 -I&0\end{bmatrix}.   Then the Berezinian of X is defined as        Ber   (  X  )    =   Ber   (   J  X   )    =   det    (   C  -   D   B   -  1    A    )    det    (   -  B   )    -  1        .         Ber  X    Ber    J  X               C    D   superscript  B    1    A       superscript    B     1          \operatorname{Ber}(X)=\operatorname{Ber}(JX)=\det(C-DB^{-1}A)\det(-B)^{-1}.     Properties   The Berezinian of X is always a unit in the ring R 0 .      Ber    (  X  )    -  1    =  Ber   (   X   -  1    )      fragments  Ber   superscript   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-)     1     Ber   fragments  normal-(   superscript  X    1    normal-)     \operatorname{Ber}(X)^{-1}=\operatorname{Ber}(X^{-1})          Ber   (   X   s  t    )    =   Ber   (  X  )         Ber   superscript  X    s  t      Ber  X     \operatorname{Ber}(X^{st})=\operatorname{Ber}(X)   where    X   s  t      superscript  X    s  t     X^{st}   denotes the supertranspose of X .       Ber   (   X  âŠ•  Y   )    =     Ber   (  X  )    Ber    (  Y  )         Ber   direct-sum  X  Y        Ber  X   Ber   Y     \operatorname{Ber}(X\oplus Y)=\operatorname{Ber}(X)\mathrm{Ber}(Y)      Berezinian module  The determinant of an endomorphism of a free module M can be defined as the induced action on the 1-dimensional highest exterior power of M . In the supersymmetric case there is no highest exterior power, but there is a still a similar definition of the Berezinian as follows.  Suppose that M is a free module of dimension ( p , q ) over R . Let A be the (super)symmetric algebra S *( M *) of the dual M * of M . Then an automorphism of M acts on the ext module      E  x   t  A  p    (  R  ,  A  )       E  x   superscript   subscript  t  A   p    R  A     Ext_{A}^{p}(R,A)   (which has dimension (1,0) if q is even and dimension (0,1) if q is odd)) as multiplication by the Berezianian.
