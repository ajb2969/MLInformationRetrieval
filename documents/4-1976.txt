List of interactive geometry software

Interactive geometry software (IGS, or dynamic geometry environments, DGEs) are computer programs which allow one to create and then manipulate geometric constructions, primarily in plane geometry. In most IGS, one starts construction by putting a few points and using them to define new objects such as lines, circles or other points. After some Yconstruction is done, one can move the points one started with and see how the construction changes.
History
The earliest IGS was the Geometric Supposer, which was developed in the early 1980s.1 This was soon followed by Cabri in 1986 and The Geometer's Sketchpad.
Comparison
There are three main types of computer environments for studying school geometry: supposers, dynamic geometry environments (DGEs) and Logo-based programs.2 Most are DGEs: software that allows the user to manipulate ("drag") the geometric object into different shapes or positions. The main example of a supposer is the Geometric Supposer, which does not have draggable objects, but allows students to study pre-defined shapes. Nearly all of the following programs are DGEs. For a related, comparative physical example of these algorithms, see Lenart Sphere.

Geometrix, which generates a large number of different solutions, offers the student, when he has finished his demonstration, a canonical form of the demonstration and displays some suggestions on possible alternatives.
Allows a teacher to propose to a student a specific geometry construction exercise and then the software will check the student's diagram for accuracy.

parametrized modeling (using FuncDesigner)
performing numerical optimization and solving geometrical systems of equations (possibly parametrized) by OpenOpt, using FuncDesigner automatic differentiation, that yields more precise (and very often faster) results than finite-differences derivatives approximation
some graphic output using Matplotlib (any other Python graphic visualization library from the variety can be easily connected).

Continuity vs. determinism
All these programs can be divided into two category: deterministic and continuous. GeoGebra can be deterministic or continuous (one can change it in preferences).
All constructions in the deterministic programs (GSP, Cabri, Kseg and most of others) are completely determined by the given points but the result of some constructions can jump or behave unexpectedly when a given point is moved.
On the contrary, some constructions in continuous programs (so far only Cinderella and GeoGebra), depend on the number of hidden parameters and in such a way that moving a given point produces a continuous motion of the construction, as a result, if the point is moved back to the original position the result of construction might be different.
Here is a test to check whether a particular program is continuous:
Construct the orthocenter of triangle and three midpoints (say ''A', B' C' '' ) between vertices and orthocenter.
Construct a circumcircle of ''A'B'C' ''.
This is the nine-point circle, it intersects each side of the original triangle at two points: the base of altitude and midpoint. Construct an intersection of one side with the circle at midpoint now move opposite vertex of the original triangle, if the constructed point does not move when base of altitude moves through it that probably means that your program is continuous.
Although it is possible to make a deterministic program which behaves continuously in this and similar simple examples, in general it can be proved that no program can be continuous and deterministic at the same time.16
