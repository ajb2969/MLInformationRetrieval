Equalization (proof)

  and 
 
 
 
 .
Equalization is a mathematical analysis of static load-sharing (also called load-distributing) 2-point anchor systems.
Derivation
Consider the node, where the two anchor legs join with the main line. At this node, the sum of all forces in the x-direction must equal zero since the system is in mechanical equilibrium.






 The net force in the y-direction must also sum to zero.



 Substitute 
 
 
 
  from equation () into equation () and factor out 
 
 
 
 .





 Solve for 
 
 
 
  and simplify.











 Use a trigonometric identity to simplify more and arrive at our final solution for 
 
 
 
 .

 Then use 
 
 
 
  from equation () and substitute into () to solve for 
 
 





Symmetrical Anchor - Special Case
(Figure)
This diagram shows the specific case when the anchor is symmetrical. Notice 
 
 
 
 .

Let us now analyze a specific case in which the two anchors are "symmetrical" along the y-axis.
Start by noticing 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the same. Let us start from equation () and substitute 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  and simplify.






 And using another trigonometric identity we can simplify the denominator.






 Note that 
 
 
 
  is half of the angle 
 
 
 
  between the two anchor points. To express the force at each anchor using the entire angle 
 
 
 
 , we substitute 
 
 
 
 .
