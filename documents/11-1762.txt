Degasperis–Procesi equation

In mathematical physics, the Degasperis–Procesi equation



is one of only two exactly solvable equations in the following family of third-order, non-linear, dispersive PDEs:



where 
 
 
 
  and b are real parameters (b=3 for the Degasperis–Procesi equation). It was discovered by Degasperis and Procesi in a search for integrable equations similar in form to the Camassa–Holm equation, which is the other integrable equation in this family (corresponding to b=2); that those two equations are the only integrable cases has been verified using a variety of different integrability tests.1 Although discovered solely because of its mathematical properties, the Degasperis–Procesi equation (with 
 
 
 
 ) has later been found to play a similar role in water wave theory as the Camassa–Holm equation.2
Soliton solutions
Among the solutions of the Degasperis–Procesi equation (in the special case 
 
 
 
 ) are the so-called multipeakon solutions, which are functions of the form



where the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  satisfy3



These ODEs can be solved explicitly in terms of elementary functions, using inverse spectral methods.4
When 
 
 
 
  the soliton solutions of the Degasperis–Procesi equation are smooth; they converge to peakons in the limit as 
 
 
 
  tends to zero.5
Discontinuous solutions
The Degasperis–Procesi equation (with 
 
 
 
 ) is formally equivalent to the (nonlocal) hyperbolic conservation law



where 
 
 
 
 , and where the star denotes convolution with respect to x. In this formulation, it admits weak solutions with a very low degree of regularity, even discontinuous ones (shock waves).6 In contrast, the corresponding formulation of the Camassa–Holm equation contains a convolution involving both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , which only makes sense if u lies in the Sobolev space

 
  with respect to x. By the Sobolev imbedding theorem, this means in particular that the weak solutions of the Camassa–Holm equation must be continuous with respect to x.
