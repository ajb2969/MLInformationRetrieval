   Degasperis–Procesi equation      Degasperis–Procesi equation   In mathematical physics , the Degasperis–Procesi equation         u  t   -   u   x  x  t     +   2  κ   u  x    +   4  u   u  x     =    3   u  x    u   x  x     +   u   u   x  x  x               subscript  u  t    subscript  u    x  x  t       2  κ   subscript  u  x      4  u   subscript  u  x         3   subscript  u  x    subscript  u    x  x       u   subscript  u    x  x  x        \displaystyle u_{t}-u_{xxt}+2\kappa u_{x}+4uu_{x}=3u_{x}u_{xx}+uu_{xxx}     is one of only two exactly solvable equations in the following family of third- order , non-linear, dispersive PDEs :          u  t   -   u   x  x  t     +   2  κ   u  x    +    (   b  +  1   )   u   u  x     =    b   u  x    u   x  x     +   u   u   x  x  x       ,           subscript  u  t    subscript  u    x  x  t       2  κ   subscript  u  x        b  1   u   subscript  u  x         b   subscript  u  x    subscript  u    x  x       u   subscript  u    x  x  x        \displaystyle u_{t}-u_{xxt}+2\kappa u_{x}+(b+1)uu_{x}=bu_{x}u_{xx}+uu_{xxx},     where   κ   κ   \kappa   and b are real parameters ( b =3 for the Degasperis–Procesi equation). It was discovered by Degasperis and Procesi in a search for integrable equations similar in form to the Camassa–Holm equation , which is the other integrable equation in this family (corresponding to b =2); that those two equations are the only integrable cases has been verified using a variety of different integrability tests. 1 Although discovered solely because of its mathematical properties, the Degasperis–Procesi equation (with    κ  >  0      κ  0    \kappa>0   ) has later been found to play a similar role in water wave theory as the Camassa–Holm equation. 2  Soliton solutions  Among the solutions of the Degasperis–Procesi equation (in the special case    κ  =  0      κ  0    \kappa=0   ) are the so-called multipeakon solutions, which are functions of the form       u   (  x  ,  t  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     m  i    (  t  )    e   -   |   x  -    x  i    (  t  )     |             u   x  t      superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  m  i   t   superscript  e        x     subscript  x  i   t           \displaystyle u(x,t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}(t)e^{-|x-x_{i}(t)|}     where the functions    m  i     subscript  m  i    m_{i}   and    x  i     subscript  x  i    x_{i}   satisfy 3          x  ˙   i   =    ∑   j  =  1   n     m  j    e   -   |    x  i   -   x  j    |        ,     m  ˙   i   =   2   m  i     ∑   j  =  1   n      m  j     sgn   (    x  i   -   x  j    )     e   -   |    x  i   -   x  j    |          .     formulae-sequence     subscript   normal-˙  x   i     superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  m  j    superscript  e         subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j             subscript   normal-˙  m   i     2   subscript  m  i     superscript   subscript     j  1    n      subscript  m  j    sgn     subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j      superscript  e         subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j             \dot{x}_{i}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}m_{j}e^{-|x_{i}-x_{j}|},\qquad\dot{m}_{i}=2m_{i}\sum%
 _{j=1}^{n}m_{j}\,\operatorname{sgn}{(x_{i}-x_{j})}e^{-|x_{i}-x_{j}|}.     These ODEs can be solved explicitly in terms of elementary functions, using inverse spectral methods . 4  When    κ  >  0      κ  0    \kappa>0   the soliton solutions of the Degasperis–Procesi equation are smooth; they converge to peakons in the limit as   κ   κ   \kappa   tends to zero. 5  Discontinuous solutions  The Degasperis–Procesi equation (with    κ  =  0      κ  0    \kappa=0   ) is formally equivalent to the (nonlocal) hyperbolic conservation law          ∂  t   u   +    ∂  x    [     u  2   2   +    G  2   *    3   u  2    2     ]     =  0   ,          subscript   t   u     subscript   x        superscript  u  2   2       G  2       3   superscript  u  2    2       0    \partial_{t}u+\partial_{x}\left[\frac{u^{2}}{2}+\frac{G}{2}*\frac{3u^{2}}{2}%
 \right]=0,     where     G   (  x  )    =   exp   (   -   |  x  |    )          G  x         x       G(x)=\exp(-|x|)   , and where the star denotes convolution with respect to x . In this formulation, it admits weak solutions with a very low degree of regularity, even discontinuous ones ( shock waves ). 6 In contrast, the corresponding formulation of the Camassa–Holm equation contains a convolution involving both    u  2     superscript  u  2    u^{2}   and    u  x  2     superscript   subscript  u  x   2    u_{x}^{2}   , which only makes sense if u lies in the Sobolev space      H  1   =   W   1  ,  2         superscript  H  1    superscript  W   1  2      H^{1}=W^{1,2}   with respect to x . By the Sobolev imbedding theorem , this means in particular that the weak solutions of the Camassa–Holm equation must be continuous with respect to x .
