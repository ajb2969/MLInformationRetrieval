==Summary== This plot illustrates normalized fluctuations of the prime-counting function

 
  on the logarithmic scale.
The red line represents Î”-function, while the blue curve represents similar function where 
 
 
 
  is replaced by 
 
 
 
 , so one can compare the fluctuations with the difference between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The image was built by Droog_Andrey using Wolfram Mathematica 7.0 as follows:
LogLinearPlot[{(PrimePi[x] - RiemannR[x] + 1/Log[x] - ArcTan[Pi/Log[x]]/Pi)*Log[x]/Sqrt[x], (LogIntegral[x] - RiemannR[x] + 1/Log[x] - ArcTan[Pi/Log[x]]/Pi)*Log[x]/Sqrt[x]}, {x, 1, Exp[14]}, PlotPoints -> 10000, PlotRange -> All, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}, AxesOrigin -> {1, 0}, AspectRatio -> 1/2, AxesStyle -> Thick, TicksStyle -> Directive[Thick, Bold, 16]]
