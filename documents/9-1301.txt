The red line represents Δ-function , while the blue curve represents similar function where     π  0    (  x  )        subscript  π  0   x    \pi_{0}(x)   is replaced by    li   (  x  )       li  x    \mathrm{li}(x)   , so one can compare the fluctuations with the difference between    π   (  x  )       π  x    \pi(x)   and    li   (  x  )       li  x    \mathrm{li}(x)   .  The image was built by Droog_Andrey using Wolfram Mathematica 7.0 as follows:  LogLinearPlot[{(PrimePi[x] - RiemannR[x] + 1/Log[x] - ArcTan[Pi/Log[x]]/Pi)*Log[x]/Sqrt[x], (LogIntegral[x] - RiemannR[x] + 1/Log[x] - ArcTan[Pi/Log[x]]/Pi)*Log[x]/Sqrt[x]}, {x, 1, Exp[14]}, PlotPoints -> 10000, PlotRange -> All, PlotStyle -> {Red, Blue}, AxesOrigin -> {1, 0}, AspectRatio -> 1/2, AxesStyle -> Thick, TicksStyle -> Directive[Thick, Bold, 16]]  Licensing  "
