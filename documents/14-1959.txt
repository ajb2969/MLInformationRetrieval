   Holomorphic Lefschetz fixed-point formula      Holomorphic Lefschetz fixed-point formula   In mathematics , the Holomorphic Lefschetz formula is an analogue for complex manifolds of the Lefschetz fixed-point formula that relates a sum over the fixed points of a holomorphic vector field of a compact complex manifold to a sum over its Dolbeault cohomology groups.  Statement  If f is an automorphism of a compact complex manifold M with isolated fixed points, then        ∑    f   (  p  )    =  p     1   det   (   1  -   A  p    )      =    ∑  q      (   -  1   )   q    trace   (   f  *   |    H   ∂  ¯    0  ,  q     (  M  )    )            subscript       f  p   p      1      1   subscript  A  p         subscript   q      superscript    1   q    trace   superscript  f       subscript   superscript  H   0  q     normal-¯     M        \sum_{f(p)=p}\frac{1}{\det(1-A_{p})}=\sum_{q}(-1)^{q}\operatorname{trace}(f^{*%
