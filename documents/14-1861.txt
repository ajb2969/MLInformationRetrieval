   Least squares (function approximation)      Least squares (function approximation)   In mathematics , the idea of least squares can be applied to approximating a given function by a weighted sum of other functions. The best approximation can be defined as that which minimises the difference between the original function and the approximation; for a least-squares approach the quality of the approximation is measured in terms of the squared differences between the two.  Functional analysis  A generalization to approximation of a data set is the approximation of a function by a sum of other functions, usually an orthogonal set : 1        f   (  x  )    ≈    f  n    (  x  )    =     a  1    ϕ  1    (  x  )    +    a  2    ϕ  2    (  x  )    +  ⋯  +    a  n    ϕ  n    (  x  )      ,          f  x      subscript  f  n   x             subscript  a  1    subscript  ϕ  1   x      subscript  a  2    subscript  ϕ  2   x   normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    subscript  ϕ  n   x       f(x)\approx f_{n}(x)=a_{1}\phi_{1}(x)+a_{2}\phi_{2}(x)+\cdots+a_{n}\phi_{n}(x),     with the set of functions {      ϕ   j    (  x  )        subscript  ϕ  j   x    \ \phi_{j}(x)   } an orthonormal set over the interval of interest, : see also Fejér's theorem . The coefficients {     a   j     subscript  a  j    \ a_{j}   } are selected to make the magnitude of the difference || || 2 as small as possible. For example, the magnitude, or norm, of a function  over the  can be defined by: 2       ∥  g  ∥   =    (    ∫  a  b     g  *    (  x  )   g   (  x  )   d  x    )    1  /  2         norm  g    superscript    superscript   subscript   a   b      superscript  g    x  g  x  d  x      1  2      \|g\|=\left(\int_{a}^{b}g^{*}(x)g(x)\,dx\right)^{1/2}     where the ‘*’ denotes complex conjugate in the case of complex functions. The extension of Pythagoras' theorem in this manner leads to function spaces and the notion of Lebesgue measure , an idea of “space” more general than the original basis of Euclidean geometry. The  satisfy orthonormality relations : 3         ∫  a  b     ϕ  i  *    (  x  )    ϕ  j    (  x  )   d  x    =   δ   i  j     ,        superscript   subscript   a   b      superscript   subscript  ϕ  i     x   subscript  ϕ  j   x  d  x     subscript  δ    i  j      \int_{a}^{b}\phi_{i}^{*}(x)\phi_{j}(x)\,dx=\delta_{ij},     where δ ij is the Kronecker delta . Substituting function into these equations then leads to the n -dimensional Pythagorean theorem : 4         ∥   f  n   ∥   2   =     |   a  1   |   2   +    |   a  2   |   2   +  ⋯  +    |   a  n   |   2     .       superscript   norm   subscript  f  n    2      superscript     subscript  a  1    2    superscript     subscript  a  2    2   normal-⋯   superscript     subscript  a  n    2      \|f_{n}\|^{2}=|a_{1}|^{2}+|a_{2}|^{2}+\cdots+|a_{n}|^{2}.\,     The coefficients { a j } making || f − ''f n || 2 as small as possible are found to be: 5        a  j   =    ∫  a  b     ϕ  j  *    (  x  )   f   (  x  )   d  x     .       subscript  a  j     superscript   subscript   a   b      superscript   subscript  ϕ  j     x  f  x  d  x      a_{j}=\int_{a}^{b}\phi_{j}^{*}(x)f(x)\,dx.     The generalization of the n -dimensional Pythagorean theorem to infinite-dimensional  real inner product spaces is known as Parseval's identity or Parseval's equation. 6 Particular examples of such a representation of a function are the Fourier series and the generalized Fourier series .
