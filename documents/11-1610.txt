   Sphingosine cholinephosphotransferase      Sphingosine cholinephosphotransferase   In enzymology , a sphingosine cholinephosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CDP-choline + sphingosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CMP + sphingosyl-phosphocholine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-choline and sphingosine , whereas its two products are CMP and sphingosyl-phosphocholine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-choline:sphingosine cholinephosphotransferase . Other names in common use include CDP-choline-sphingosine cholinephosphotransferase , phosphorylcholine-sphingosine transferase , cytidine diphosphocholine-sphingosine cholinephosphotransferase , and sphingosine choline phosphotransferase . This enzyme participates in sphingolipid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.7.8  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
