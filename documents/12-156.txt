Hu Washizu principle

In continuum mechanics, and in particular in finite element analysis, the Hu-Washizu principle is a variational principle which says that the action



is stationary, where 
 
 
 
  is the elastic stiffness tensor. The Hu-Washizu principle is used to develop mixed finite element methods.1 The principle is named after Hu Haichang and K. Washizu.
