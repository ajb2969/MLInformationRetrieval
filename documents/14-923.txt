Grain size




Grain size

 
Particle size, also called grain size, refers to the diameter of individual grains of sediment, or the lithified particles in clastic rocks. The term may also be applied to other granular materials. This is different from the crystallite size, which refers to the size of a single crystal inside a particle or grain. A single grain can be composed of several crystals. Granular material can range from very small colloidal particles, through clay, silt, sand, and gravel, to boulders.
Krumbein Phi Scale-United States
Size ranges define limits of classes that are given names in the Wentworth scale (or Udden-Wentworth) used in the United States. The Krumbein phi (φ) scale, a modification of the Wentworth scale created by W. C. Krumbein1 in 1937, is a logarithmic scale computed by the equation


 
  where


 
  is the Krumbein phi scale,


 
  is the diameter of the particle, and


 
  is a reference diameter, equal to 1 mm (to make the equation dimensionally consistent). This equation can be rearranged to find diameter using φ:

In some schemes, gravel is anything larger than sand (comprising granule, pebble, cobble, and boulder in the table above).
International scale
ISO 14688-1:2002, establishes the basic principles for the identification and classification of soils on the basis of those material and mass characteristics most commonly used for soils for engineering purposes. ISO 14688-1 is applicable to natural soils in situ, similar man-made materials in situ and soils redeposited by man.2

Sorting
An accumulation of sediment can also be characterized by the grain size distribution, called sorting. According to a formula3 the sorting can be quantified as




φ < 0.35

0.35 < φ < 0.50

0.50 < φ < 0.71

0.71 < φ < 1.00

1.00 < φ < 2.00

2.00 < φ

well sorted

moderately well sorted

moderately sorted

poorly sorted

very poorly sorted
