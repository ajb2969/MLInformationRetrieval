   Archimedean spiral      Archimedean spiral     The Archimedean spiral (also known as the arithmetic spiral or spiral of Archimedes ) is a spiral named after the 3rd century BC Greek  mathematician  Archimedes . It is the locus of points corresponding to the locations over time of a point moving away from a fixed point with a constant speed along a line which rotates with constant angular velocity . Equivalently, in polar coordinates ( r , θ ) it can be described by the equation       r   =   a  +   b  θ        r    a    b  θ      \,r=a+b\theta     with real numbers  a and b . Changing the parameter a will turn the spiral, while b controls the distance between successive turnings.  Archimedes described such a spiral in his book On Spirals .  Characteristics  The Archimedean spiral has the property that any ray from the origin intersects successive turnings of the spiral in points with a constant separation distance (equal to 2 π b if θ is measured in radians ), hence the name "arithmetic spiral".  In contrast to this, in a logarithmic spiral these distances, as well as the distances of the intersection points measured from the origin, form a geometric progression .  The Archimedean spiral has two arms, one for θ > 0 and one for θ "successive turnings of the Archimedean spiral have a constant separation distance"   This is somewhat misleading. The constant distances in the Archimedean spiral are measured along rays from the origin, which do not cross the curve at right angles, whereas a distance between parallel curves is measured orthogonally to both curves. There is a curve slightly different from the Archimedean spiral, the involute of a circle , whose turns have constant separation distance in the latter sense of parallel curves .  General Archimedean spiral  Sometimes the term Archimedean spiral is used for the more general group of spirals       r  =   a  +   b   θ   1  /  c       .      r    a    b   superscript  θ    1  c        r=a+b\theta^{1/c}.     The normal Archimedean spiral occurs when c = 1. Other spirals falling into this group include the hyperbolic spiral , Fermat's spiral , and the lituus . Virtually all static spirals appearing in nature are logarithmic spirals , not Archimedean ones. Many dynamic spirals (such as the Parker spiral of the solar wind , or the pattern made by a Catherine's wheel ) are Archimedean.  Applications  One method of squaring the circle , by relaxing the strict limitations on the use of straightedge and compass in ancient Greek geometric proofs, makes use of an Archimedean spiral.  The Archimedean spiral has a variety of real-world applications. Scroll compressors , made from two interleaved involutes of a circle of the same size that almost resemble Archimedean spirals, are used for compressing liquids and gases. 1 The coils of watch  balance springs and the grooves of very early gramophone records form Archimedean spirals, making the grooves evenly spaced and maximizing the amount of music that could be fitted onto the record (although this was later changed to allow better sound quality). 2 Asking for a patient to draw an Archimedean spiral is a way of quantifying human tremor ; this information helps in diagnosing neurological diseases. Archimedean spirals are also used in digital light processing (DLP) projection systems to minimize the " rainbow effect ", making it look as if multiple colors are displayed at the same time, when in reality red, green, and blue are being cycled extremely quickly. 3 Additionally, Archimedean spirals are used in food microbiology to quantify bacterial concentration through a spiral platter. 4 They are also used to model the pattern that occurs in a roll of paper or tape of constant thickness wrapped around a cylinder. 5 6  See also   Archimedes' screw  Hyperbolic spiral  Fermat's spiral  Logarithmic spiral  Spiral of Theodorus  Triple spiral symbol  Golden Spiral of Fibonacci   References  External links   Jonathan Matt making the Archimedean spiral interesting - Video : The surprising beauty of Mathematics - TedX Talks , Green Farms    Page with Java application to interactively explore the Archimedean spiral and its related curves  Online exploration using JSXGraph (JavaScript)   "  Category:Spirals     ↩  .
