   Relative interior      Relative interior   In mathematics , the relative interior of a set is a refinement of the concept of the interior , which is often more useful when dealing with low-dimensional sets placed in higher-dimensional spaces. Intuitively, the relative interior of a set contains all points which are not on the "edge" of the set, relative to the smallest subspace in which this set lies.  Formally, the relative interior of a set S (denoted    relint   (  S  )      relint  S    \operatorname{relint}(S)   ) is defined as its interior within the affine hull of S . 1 In other words,        relint   (  S  )    :=   {   x  ∈  S   :     ∃  ϵ   >  0   ,      N  ϵ    (  x  )    ∩   aff   (  S  )     ⊆  S    }    ,     assign   relint  S    conditional-set    x  S    formulae-sequence      ϵ   0          subscript  N  ϵ   x    aff  S    S       \operatorname{relint}(S):=\{x\in S:\exists\epsilon>0,N_{\epsilon}(x)\cap%
 \operatorname{aff}(S)\subseteq S\},   where    aff   (  S  )      aff  S    \operatorname{aff}(S)   is the affine hull of S , and     N  ϵ    (  x  )        subscript  N  ϵ   x    N_{\epsilon}(x)   is a ball of radius   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   centered on   x   x   x   . Any metric can be used for the construction of the ball; all metrics define the same set as the relative interior.  For any nonempty convex sets     C  ⊆   ℝ  n       C   superscript  ℝ  n     C\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}   the relative interior can be defined as        relint   (  C  )    :=   {   x  ∈  C   :     ∀  y   ∈    C    ∃  λ    >  1   :     λ  x   +    (   1  -  λ   )   y    ∈  C    }    .     assign   relint  C    conditional-set    x  C    normal-:       for-all  y     C    λ         1          λ  x       1  λ   y    C       \operatorname{relint}(C):=\{x\in C:\forall{y\in C}\;\exists{\lambda>1}:\lambda
