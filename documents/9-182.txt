Relative interior

In mathematics, the relative interior of a set is a refinement of the concept of the interior, which is often more useful when dealing with low-dimensional sets placed in higher-dimensional spaces. Intuitively, the relative interior of a set contains all points which are not on the "edge" of the set, relative to the smallest subspace in which this set lies.
Formally, the relative interior of a set S (denoted 
 
 
 
 ) is defined as its interior within the affine hull of S.1 In other words,


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the affine hull of S, and 
 
 
 
  is a ball of radius 
 
 
 
  centered on 
 
 
 
 . Any metric can be used for the construction of the ball; all metrics define the same set as the relative interior.
For any nonempty convex sets

 
  the relative interior can be defined as
