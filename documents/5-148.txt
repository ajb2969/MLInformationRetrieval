   Relative homology      Relative homology   In algebraic topology , a branch of mathematics , the (singular) homology of a topological space relative to a subspace is a construction in singular homology , for pairs of spaces . The relative homology is useful and important in several ways. Intuitively, it helps determine what part of an absolute homology group comes from which subspace.  Definition  Given a subspace    A  ⊂  X      A  X    A\subset X   , one may form the short exact sequence      0  →    C  ∙    (  A  )    →    C  ∙    (  X  )    →      C  ∙    (  X  )    /   C  ∙     (  A  )    →  0       normal-→  0     subscript  C  normal-∙   A     normal-→       subscript  C  normal-∙   X     normal-→           subscript  C  normal-∙   X    subscript  C  normal-∙    A     normal-→    0     0\to C_{\bullet}(A)\to C_{\bullet}(X)\to C_{\bullet}(X)/C_{\bullet}(A)\to 0     where     C  ∙    (  X  )        subscript  C  normal-∙   X    C_{\bullet}(X)   denotes the singular chains on the space X . The boundary map on     C  ∙    (  X  )        subscript  C  normal-∙   X    C_{\bullet}(X)   leaves     C  ∙    (  A  )        subscript  C  normal-∙   A    C_{\bullet}(A)   invariant and therefore descends to a boundary map on the quotient. The corresponding homology is called relative homology :         H  n    (  X  ,  A  )    =    H  n    (      C  ∙    (  X  )    /   C  ∙     (  A  )    )     .         subscript  H  n    X  A       subscript  H  n          subscript  C  normal-∙   X    subscript  C  normal-∙    A      H_{n}(X,A)=H_{n}(C_{\bullet}(X)/C_{\bullet}(A)).     One says that relative homology is given by the relative cycles , chains whose boundaries are chains on A , modulo the relative boundaries (chains that are homologous to a chain on A , i.e. chains that would be boundaries, modulo A again).  Properties  The above short exact sequences specifying the relative chain groups gives rise to a chain complex of short exact sequences. An application of the snake lemma then yields a long exact sequence       ⋯  →    H  n    (  A  )    →    H  n    (  X  )    →    H  n    (  X  ,  A  )     →  δ     H   n  -  1     (  A  )    →  ⋯   .       normal-→  normal-⋯     subscript  H  n   A     normal-→       subscript  H  n   X     normal-→       subscript  H  n    X  A       superscript  normal-→  δ        subscript  H    n  1    A     normal-→    normal-⋯     \cdots\to H_{n}(A)\to H_{n}(X)\to H_{n}(X,A)\stackrel{\delta}{\to}H_{n-1}(A)%
 \to\cdots.     The connecting map δ takes a relative cycle, representing a homology class in H n ( X , A ), to its boundary (which is a cycle in A ).  It follows that H n ( X , x 0 ), where x 0 is a point in X , is the n -th reduced homology group of X . In other words, H i ( X , x 0 ) = H i ( X ) for all i > 0. When i = 0, H 0 ( X , x 0 ) is the free module of one rank less than H 0 ( X ). The connected component containing x 0 becomes trivial in relative homology.  The excision theorem says that removing a sufficiently nice subset Z ⊂ A leaves the relative homology groups H n ( X , A ) unchanged. Using the long exact sequence of pairs and the excision theorem, one can show that H n ( X , A ) is the same as the n -th reduced homology groups of the quotient space X / A .  The n -th local homology group of a space X at a point x 0 is defined to be H n ( X , X - { x 0 }). Informally, this is the "local" homology of X close to x 0 .  Relative homology readily extends to the triple ( X , Y , Z ) for Z ⊂ Y ⊂ X .  One can define the Euler characteristic for a pair Y ⊂ X by        χ   (  X  ,  Y  )    =    ∑   j  =  0   n       (   -  1   )   j     rank    H  j    (  X  ,  Y  )      .        χ   X  Y      superscript   subscript     j  0    n      superscript    1   j   rank   subscript  H  j    X  Y       \chi(X,Y)=\sum_{j=0}^{n}(-1)^{j}\;\mbox{rank}\;H_{j}(X,Y).     The exactness of the sequence implies that the Euler characteristic is additive , i.e. if Z ⊂ Y ⊂ X , one has        χ   (  X  ,  Z  )    =    χ   (  X  ,  Y  )    +   χ   (  Y  ,  Z  )      .        χ   X  Z        χ   X  Y      χ   Y  Z       \chi(X,Z)=\chi(X,Y)+\chi(Y,Z).\,     Functoriality  The map    C  ∙     subscript  C  normal-∙    C_{\bullet}   can be considered to be a functor       C  ∙   :    𝕋  𝕠   𝕡  2    →   𝒞  𝒞       normal-:   subscript  C  normal-∙    normal-→    𝕋  𝕠   superscript  𝕡  2      𝒞  𝒞      C_{\bullet}:\mathbb{Top}^{2}\to\mathcal{CC}     where Top 2 is the category of pairs of topological spaces and     𝒞  𝒞      𝒞  𝒞    \mathcal{CC}    is the category chain complexes of abelian groups .  Examples  One important use of relative homology is the computation of the homology groups of quotient spaces    X  /  A      X  A    X/A   . In the case that   A   A   A   is a subspace of   X   X   X   fulfilling the mild regularity condition that there exists a neighborhood of   A   A   A   that has   A   A   A   as a deformation retract, then the group      H  ~   n    (   X  /  A   )        subscript   normal-~  H   n     X  A     \tilde{H}_{n}(X/A)   is isomorphic to     H  n    (  X  ,  A  )        subscript  H  n    X  A     H_{n}(X,A)   . We can immediately use this fact to compute the homology of a sphere. We can realize    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   as the quotient of an n-disk by its boundary, i.e.     S  n   =    D  n   /   S   n  -  1          superscript  S  n      superscript  D  n    superscript  S    n  1       S^{n}=D^{n}/S^{n-1}   . Applying the exact sequence of relative homology gives the following:      ⋯  →    H  n    (   D  n   )    →    H  n    (   D  n   ,   S   n  -  1    )    →    H   n  -  1     (   S   n  -  1    )    →    H   n  -  1     (   D  n   )    →  ⋯   .       normal-→  normal-⋯     subscript  H  n    superscript  D  n      normal-→       subscript  H  n     superscript  D  n    superscript  S    n  1        normal-→       subscript  H    n  1     superscript  S    n  1       normal-→       subscript  H    n  1     superscript  D  n      normal-→    normal-⋯     \cdots\to H_{n}(D^{n})\rightarrow H_{n}(D^{n},S^{n-1})\rightarrow H_{n-1}(S^{n%
 -1})\rightarrow H_{n-1}(D^{n})\to\cdots.     Because the disk is contractible, we know its homology groups vanish in all dimensions, so the above sequence collapses to the short exact sequence:      0  →    H  n    (   D  n   ,   S   n  -  1    )    →    H   n  -  1     (   S   n  -  1    )    →  0.       normal-→  0     subscript  H  n     superscript  D  n    superscript  S    n  1        normal-→       subscript  H    n  1     superscript  S    n  1       normal-→    0.     0\rightarrow H_{n}(D^{n},S^{n-1})\rightarrow H_{n-1}(S^{n-1})\rightarrow 0.     Therefore, we get isomorphisms      H  n    (   D  n   ,   S   n  -  1    )    ≅    H   n  -  1     (   S   n  -  1    )           subscript  H  n     superscript  D  n    superscript  S    n  1         subscript  H    n  1     superscript  S    n  1       H_{n}(D^{n},S^{n-1})\cong H_{n-1}(S^{n-1})   . We can now proceed by induction to show that      H  n    (   D  n   ,   S   n  -  1    )    ≅  ℤ         subscript  H  n     superscript  D  n    superscript  S    n  1      ℤ    H_{n}(D^{n},S^{n-1})\cong\mathbb{Z}   . Now because    S   n  -  1      superscript  S    n  1     S^{n-1}   is the deformation retract of a suitable neighborhood of itself in    D  n     superscript  D  n    D^{n}   , we get that       H  n    (   D  n   ,   S   n  -  1    )    ≅    H  n    (   S  n   )    ≅  ℤ   .           subscript  H  n     superscript  D  n    superscript  S    n  1         subscript  H  n    superscript  S  n         ℤ     H_{n}(D^{n},S^{n-1})\cong H_{n}(S^{n})\cong\mathbb{Z}.
