   Cinquefoil knot      Cinquefoil knot   In knot theory , the cinquefoil knot , also known as Solomon's seal knot or the pentafoil knot , is one of two knots with crossing number five, the other being the three-twist knot . It is listed as the 5 1 knot in the Alexander-Briggs notation , and can also be described as the (5,2)- torus knot . The cinquefoil is the closed version of the double overhand knot .  The cinquefoil is a prime knot . Its writhe is 5, and it is invertible but not amphichiral . 1 Its Alexander polynomial is       Δ   (  t  )    =       t  2   -  t   +  1   -   t   -  1     +   t   -  2           normal-Δ  t            superscript  t  2   t   1    superscript  t    1      superscript  t    2       \Delta(t)=t^{2}-t+1-t^{-1}+t^{-2}   , its Conway polynomial is       ∇   (  z  )    =    z  4   +   3   z  2    +  1        normal-∇  z      superscript  z  4     3   superscript  z  2    1     \nabla(z)=z^{4}+3z^{2}+1   , and its Jones polynomial is        V   (  q  )    =       q   -  2    +   q   -  4     -   q   -  5     +   q   -  6     -   q   -  7      .        V  q            superscript  q    2     superscript  q    4      superscript  q    5      superscript  q    6      superscript  q    7       V(q)=q^{-2}+q^{-4}-q^{-5}+q^{-6}-q^{-7}.    2 Surprisingly, these are the same as the Alexander, Conway, and Jones polynomials of the knot 10 132 . 3 However, the Kauffman polynomial can be used to distinguish between these two knots.  The name “cinquefoil” comes from the five-petaled flowers of plants in the genus Potentilla .  (Figure)  Edible cinquefoil knot.
