Paul Leyland

Paul Leyland is a British number theorist who has studied integer factorization and primality testing.
He has contributed to the factorization of RSA-129, RSA-140, and RSA-155, as well as potential factorial primes as large as 400! + 1. He has also studied Cunningham numbers, Cullen numbers, Woodall numbers, etc., and numbers of the form 
 
 
 
 , which are now called Leyland numbers.1 He was involved with the NFSNet project to use distributed computing on the Internet from 2005 to 2008.2
In 2002, he co-authored a paper with Samuel S. Wagstaff Jr. entitled "MPQS with three large primes" in the Proceedings of the Algorithmic Number Theory Symposium 2002. Since Wagstaff co-authored a paper with Paul Erdős, this means Leyland has an Erdős number of 2.
