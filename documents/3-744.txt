Pincherle derivative

In mathematics, the Pincherle derivative T’ of a linear operator T:K[x] → K[x] on the vector space of polynomials in the variable x over a field K is the commutator of T with the multiplication by x in the algebra of endomorphisms End(K[x]). That is, T’ is another linear operator T’:K[x] → K[x]



so that



This concept is named after the Italian mathematician Salvatore Pincherle (1853–1936).
Properties
The Pincherle derivative, like any commutator, is a derivation, meaning it satisfies the sum and products rules: given two linear operators

 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  belonging to 
 
 




 
  ;


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the composition of operators ;

One also has 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the usual Lie bracket, which follows from the Jacobi identity.
The usual derivative, D = d/dx, is an operator on polynomials. By straightforward computation, its Pincherle derivative is



This formula generalizes to



by induction. It proves that the Pincherle derivative of a differential operator



is also a differential operator, so that the Pincherle derivative is a derivation of 
 
 
 
 
 .
The shift operator



can be written as



by the Taylor formula. Its Pincherle derivative is then



In other words, the shift operators are eigenvectors of the Pincherle derivative, whose spectrum is the whole space of scalars 
 
 
 
 .
If T is shift-equivariant, that is, if T commutes with Sh or 
 
 
 
 
 , then we also have 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
  is also shift-equivariant and for the same shift 
 
 
 
 .
The "discrete-time delta operator"



is the operator



whose Pincherle derivative is the shift operator 
 
 
 
 .
