Naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase




Naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase

In enzymology, a naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

dimethylallyl diphosphate + (-)-(2S)-naringenin 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + sophoraflavanone B
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dimethylallyl diphosphate and (-)-(2S)-naringenin, whereas its two products are diphosphate and sophoraflavanone B.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dimethylallyl-diphosphate:naringenin 8-dimethylallyltransferase. This enzyme is also called N8DT.
