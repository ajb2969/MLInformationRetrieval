   Euclidean topology      Euclidean topology   In mathematics, and especially general topology , the Euclidean topology is an example of a topology given to the set of real numbers , denoted by R . To give the set R a topology means to say which subsets of R are " open ", and to do so in a way that the following axioms are met: 1   The union of open sets is an open set.  The finite intersection of open sets is an open set.  The set R and the empty set ∅ are open sets.   Construction  The set R and the empty set ∅ are required to be open sets, and so we define R and ∅ to be open sets in this topology. Given two real numbers, say x and y , with  we define an uncountably infinite family of open sets denoted by S x , y as follows: 2        S   x  ,  y    =   {   r  ∈  ℝ   :   x  <  r  <  y   }    .       subscript  S   x  y     conditional-set    r  ℝ       x  r       y       S_{x,y}=\{r\in\mathbb{R}:x   Along with the set R and the empty set ∅, the sets S x , y with  are used as a basis for the Euclidean topology. In other words, the open sets of the Euclidean topology are given by the set R , the empty set ∅ and the unions of various sets S x , y for different pairs of ( x , y ).  Properties   The real line, with this topology, is a T 5 space . Given two subsets, say A and B , of R with , where A denotes the closure of A , there exist open sets S A and S B with and such that 3   References  "  Category:Topology     ↩
