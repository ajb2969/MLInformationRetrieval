   Lothar G√∂ttsche      Lothar G√∂ttsche   Lothar G√∂ttsche (born January 21, 1961 in Sonderburg , Denmark ) is a German  mathematician , known for his work in algebraic geometry . After studying mathematics at the University of Kiel , he received his Dr. rer. nat. under the direction of Friedrich Hirzebruch at the University of Bonn in 1989. He was invited as speaker to the International Congress of Mathematicians in Beijing in 2002. G√∂ttsche is a research scientist at the International Centre for Theoretical Physics in Trieste , Italy . He is also editor for Geometry & Topology .  G√∂ttsche received international acclaim with his formula for the generating function for the Betti numbers of the Hilbert scheme of points on an algebraic surface :  If   S   S   S   is a smooth surface over an algebraically closed field of characteristic   0   0    , then the generating function for the motives of the Hilbert schemes of   S   S   S   can be expressed in terms of the motivic zeta function by G√∂ttsche's formula        ‚àë   n  =  0   ‚àû     [   S   [  n  ]    ]    t  n     =    ‚àè   m  =  1   ‚àû    Z   (  S  ,    ùïÉ   m  -  1     t  m    )           superscript   subscript     n  0         delimited-[]   superscript  S   delimited-[]  n      superscript  t  n       superscript   subscript  product    m  1        Z   S     superscript  ùïÉ    m  1     superscript  t  m         \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}[S^{[n]}]t^{n}=\prod_{m=1}^{\infty}Z(S,{\mathbb{L}}^{m-1}t^%
 {m})     Here    S   [  n  ]      superscript  S   delimited-[]  n     S^{[n]}   is the Hilbert scheme of length   n   n   n   subschemes of   S   S   S   .  G√∂ttsche is also the author of a celebrated conjecture predicting the number of curves in certain linear systems on algebraic surfaces .  In 2012 he became a fellow of the American Mathematical Society . 1  References  External links   Home page of Lothar G√∂ttsche   "  Category:German mathematicians  Category:Algebraic geometers  Category:People from S√∏nderborg Municipality  Category:University of Kiel alumni  Category:University of Bonn alumni  Category:Fellows of the American Mathematical Society  Category:1961 births  Category:Living people     List of Fellows of the American Mathematical Society , retrieved 2013-01-19. ‚Ü©
