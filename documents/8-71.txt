Nagata's conjecture on curves

In mathematics, the Nagata conjecture on curves, named after Masayoshi Nagata, governs the minimal degree required for a plane algebraic curve to pass through a collection of very general points with prescribed multiplicities. Nagata arrived at the conjecture via work on the 14th problem of Hilbert, which asks whether the invariant ring of a linear group action on the polynomial ring  over some field 
 
 
 
  is finitely generated. Nagata published the conjecture in a 1959 paper in the American Journal of Mathematics, in which he presented a counterexample to Hilbert's 14th problem:

Nagata Conjecture. Suppose  are very general points in  and that  are given positive integers. Then for 
 
 
 
  any curve 
 
 
 
  in  that passes through each of the points  with multiplicity  must satisfy
 
 




The only case when this is known to hold is when 
 
 
 
  is a perfect square, which was proved by Nagata. Despite much interest the other cases remain open. A more modern formulation of this conjecture is often given in terms of Seshadri constants and has been generalised to other surfaces under the name of the Nagataâ€“Biran conjecture.
The condition 
 
 
 
  is easily seen to be necessary. The cases 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are distinguished by whether or not the anti-canonical bundle on the blowup of  at a collection of 
 
 
 
  points is nef.
