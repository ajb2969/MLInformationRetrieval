   Nagata's conjecture on curves      Nagata's conjecture on curves   In mathematics , the Nagata conjecture on curves, named after Masayoshi Nagata , governs the minimal degree required for a plane algebraic curve to pass through a collection of very general points with prescribed multiplicities . Nagata arrived at the conjecture via work on the 14th problem of Hilbert , which asks whether the invariant ring of a linear group action on the polynomial ring over some field   k   k   k   is finitely generated . Nagata published the conjecture in a 1959 paper in the American Journal of Mathematics , in which he presented a counterexample to Hilbert's 14th problem:   Nagata Conjecture. Suppose are very general points in and that are given positive integers. Then for    r  >  9      r  9    r>9   any curve   C   C   C   in that passes through each of the points with multiplicity must satisfy       deg  C   >    1   r      ∑   i  =  1   r    m  i      .       degree  C       1    r      superscript   subscript     i  1    r    subscript  m  i       \deg C>\frac{1}{\sqrt{r}}\sum_{i=1}^{r}m_{i}.       The only case when this is known to hold is when   r   r   r   is a perfect square, which was proved by Nagata . Despite much interest the other cases remain open. A more modern formulation of this conjecture is often given in terms of Seshadri constants and has been generalised to other surfaces under the name of the Nagata–Biran conjecture .  The condition    r  >  9      r  9    r>9   is easily seen to be necessary. The cases    r  >  9      r  9    r>9   and    r  ≤  9      r  normal-≤  9    r≤9   are distinguished by whether or not the anti-canonical bundle on the blowup of at a collection of   r   r   r   points is nef .
