The folded normal distribution is a probability distribution related to the normal distribution. Given a normally distributed random variable X with mean μ and variance σ2, the random variable Y = |X| has a folded normal distribution. Such a case may be encountered if only the magnitude of some variable is recorded, but not its sign. The distribution is called Folded because probability mass to the left of the x = 0 is "folded" over by taking the absolute value. In the physics of heat conduction, the folded normal distribution is a fundamental solution of the heat equation on the upper plane (i.e. a heat kernel).
The probability density function (PDF) is given by



for x≥0, and 0 everywhere else. It follows that the cumulative distribution function (CDF) is given by:



for x≥0, where erf() is the error function. This expression reduces to the CDF of the half-normal distribution when μ = 0.
The mean of the folded distribution is then



The variance then is expressed easily in terms of the mean:



Both the mean (μ) and variance (σ2) of X in the original normal distribution can be interpreted as the location and scale parameters of Y in the folded distribution.
Differential equations
The PDF of the folded normal distribution can also be defined by the system of differential equations
