   Loewner order      Loewner order   In mathematics, Loewner order is the partial order defined by the convex cone of positive semi-definite matrices . This order is usually employed to generalize the definitions of monotone and concave/convex scalar functions to monotone and concave/convex Hermitian valued functions . These functions arise naturally in matrix and operator theory and have applications in many areas of physics and engineering.  Definition  Let A and B be two Hermitian matrices of order n . We say that A ≥ B if A − B is positive semi-definite . Similarly, we say that A > B if A − B is positive definite .  Properties  When A and B are real scalars (i.e. n = 1), the Loewner order reduces to the usual ordering of R . Although some familiar properties of the usual order of R are also valid when n ≥ 2, several properties are no longer valid. For instance, the comparability of two matrices may no longer be valid. In fact, if    A  =   [     1    0      0    0     ]       A    1  0    0  0      A=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
 0&0\end{bmatrix}   and    B  =   [     0    0      0    1     ]       B    0  0    0  1      B=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\
 0&1\end{bmatrix}   then neither A ≥ B or B ≥ A holds true.  Moreover, since A and B are Hermitian matrices, their eigenvalues are all real numbers. If λ 1 ( B ) is the maximum eigenvalue of B and λ n ( A ) the minimum eigenvalue of A , a necessary criterion to have A ≥ B is that λ n ( A ) ≥ λ 1 ( B ). If A or B is a multiple of the identity matrix , then this criterion is also sufficient.  See also   Trace inequalities   References       "  Category:Linear algebra  Category:Matrix theory
