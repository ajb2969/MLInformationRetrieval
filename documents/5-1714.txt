   Open-loop gain      Open-loop gain   The open-loop gain of an operational amplifier is the gain obtained when no feedback is used in the circuit . Open loop gain is usually exceedingly high; in fact, an ideal operational amplifier has infinite open-loop gain. Typically an op-amp may have a maximal open-loop gain of around    10  5     superscript  10  5    10^{5}   . Normally, feedback is applied around the op-amp so that the gain of the overall circuit is defined and kept to a figure which is more usable. The very high open-loop gain of the op-amp allows a wide range of feedback levels to be applied to achieve the desired performance.  The open-loop gain of an operational amplifier falls very rapidly with increasing frequency . Along with slew rate , this is one of the reasons why operational amplifiers have limited bandwidth .  The definition of open-loop gain (at a fixed frequency) is        A  OL   =    V  out    (    V  +   -   V  -    )     ,       subscript  A  OL      subscript  V  out      superscript  V     superscript  V        A_{\text{OL}}=\frac{V_{\text{out}}}{\left(V^{+}-V^{-}\right)},     where     V  +   -   V  -        superscript  V     superscript  V      V^{+}-V^{-}   is the input voltage difference that is being amplified. The dependence on frequency is not displayed here.  See also   Loop gain   "  Category:Electrical parameters
