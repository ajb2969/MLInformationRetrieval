Besov space

In mathematics, the Besov space (named after Oleg Vladimirovich Besov) 
 
 
 
  is a complete quasinormed space which is a Banach space when 
 
 
 
 . It, as well as the similarly defined Triebel–Lizorkin space, serve to generalize more elementary function spaces and are effective at measuring (in a sense) smoothness properties of functions.
Definition
Let



and define the modulus of continuity by



Let 
 
 
 
  be a non-negative integer and define: 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 




Norm
The Besov space 
 
 
 
  is equipped with the norm



The Besov spaces 
 
 
 
  coincide with the more classical Sobolev spaces

 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  then $B^s_{p,p}(\mathbf{R}) =W^{s,p}( \mathbf{R})$.
