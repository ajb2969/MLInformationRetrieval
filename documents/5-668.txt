Tetrad (index notation)

In Riemannian geometry, we can introduce a coordinate system over the Riemannian manifold (at least, over a chart), giving n coordinates



for an n-dimensional manifold. Locally, at least, this gives a basis for the 1-forms, dxi where d is the exterior derivative. The dual basis for the tangent space T is ei.
Now, let's choose an orthonormal basis for the fibers of T. The rest is index manipulation.
Example
Take a 3-sphere with the radius R and give it polar coordinates α, θ, φ.

e(eα)/R,
 
e(eθ)/R sin(α) and
 
e(eφ)/R sin(α) sin(θ)
 

form an orthonormal basis of T.
Call these e1, e2 and e3. Given the metric η, we can ignore the covariant and contravariant distinction for T.
Then, the dreibein (triad),
