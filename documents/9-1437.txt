   Quartile coefficient of dispersion      Quartile coefficient of dispersion   In statistics , the quartile coefficient of dispersion is a descriptive statistic which measures dispersion and which is used to make comparisons within and between data sets.  The statistic is easily computed using the first ( Q 1 ) and third ( Q 3 ) quartiles for each data set. The quartile coefficient of dispersion is: 1         Q  3   -   Q  1      Q  3   +   Q  1     .         subscript  Q  3    subscript  Q  1       subscript  Q  3    subscript  Q  1      {Q_{3}-Q_{1}\over Q_{3}+Q_{1}}.     Example  Consider the following two data sets:   A = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}     n = 7, range = 12, mean = 8, median = 8, Q 1 = 4, Q 3 = 12, coefficient of dispersion = 0.5       B = {1.8, 2, 2.1, 2.4, 2.6, 2.9, 3}     n = 7, range = 1.2, mean = 2.4, median = 2.4, Q 1 = 2, Q 3 = 2.9, coefficient of dispersion = 0.18      The quartile coefficient of dispersion of data set A is 2.7 times as great (0.5 / 0.18) as that of data set B .
