   Hutchinson operator      Hutchinson operator   In mathematics , in the study of fractals , a Hutchinson operator 1 is the collective action of a set of contractions, called an iterated function system . 2 The iteration of the operator converges to a unique attractor, which is the often self-similar fixed set of the operator.  Definition  Let    {   f  i   :  X  →   X   |  1  ≤  i  ≤  N  }     fragments  normal-{   subscript  f  i   normal-:  X  normal-→  X  normal-|  1   i   N  normal-}    \{f_{i}:X\to X\ |\ 1\leq i\leq N\}   be an iterated function system , or a set of contractions from a compact set    X   X   X   to itself. The operator   H   H   H   is defined over subsets    S  ⊂  X      S  X    S\subset X   as        H   (  S  )    =    ⋃   i  =  1   N     f  i    (  S  )      .        H  S     superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  f  i   S      H(S)=\bigcup_{i=1}^{N}f_{i}(S).\,     A key question is to describe the attractors    A  =   H   (  A  )        A    H  A     A=H(A)   of this operator, which are compact sets. One way of generating such a set is to start with an initial compact set     S  0   ⊂  X       subscript  S  0   X    S_{0}\subset X   (which can be a single point, called a seed) and iterate   H   H   H   as follows       S   n  +  1    =   H   (   S  n   )    =    ⋃   i  =  1   N     f  i    (   S  n   )            subscript  S    n  1      H   subscript  S  n           superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  f  i    subscript  S  n        S_{n+1}=H(S_{n})=\bigcup_{i=1}^{N}f_{i}(S_{n})     and taking the limit, the iteration converges to the attractor       A  =    lim   n  →  ∞     S  n     .      A    subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  S  n      A=\lim_{n\to\infty}S_{n}.     Properties  Hutchinson showed in 1981 the existence and uniqueness of the attractor   A   A   A   . The proof follows by showing that the Hutchinson operator is contractive on the set of compact subsets of   X   X   X   in the Hausdorff distance .  The collection of functions    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   together with composition form a monoid . With N functions, then one may visualize the monoid as a full N-ary tree or a Cayley tree .  References    "  Category:Fractals     ↩  ↩
