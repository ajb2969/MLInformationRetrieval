Hutchinson operator

In mathematics, in the study of fractals, a Hutchinson operator1 is the collective action of a set of contractions, called an iterated function system.2 The iteration of the operator converges to a unique attractor, which is the often self-similar fixed set of the operator.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be an iterated function system, or a set of contractions from a compact set

 
  to itself. The operator 
 
 
 
  is defined over subsets 
 
 
 
 
  as



A key question is to describe the attractors 
 
 
 
  of this operator, which are compact sets. One way of generating such a set is to start with an initial compact set 
 
 
 
  (which can be a single point, called a seed) and iterate 
 
 
 
  as follows



and taking the limit, the iteration converges to the attractor



Properties
Hutchinson showed in 1981 the existence and uniqueness of the attractor 
 
 
 
 . The proof follows by showing that the Hutchinson operator is contractive on the set of compact subsets of 
 
 
 
  in the Hausdorff distance.
The collection of functions 
 
 
 
  together with composition form a monoid. With N functions, then one may visualize the monoid as a full N-ary tree or a Cayley tree.
