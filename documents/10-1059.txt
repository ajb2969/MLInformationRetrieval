   Deoxyhypusine monooxygenase      Deoxyhypusine monooxygenase   In enzymology , a deoxyhypusine monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   protein N 6 -(4-aminobutyl)- L -lysine + AH 2 + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   protein N 6 -[( R )-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl]- L -lysine + A + H 2 O   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are a protein-bound N 6 -(4-aminobutyl)- L - lysine , an electron acceptor AH 2 , and O 2 , and its 3 products are protein-bound N 6 -[( R )-4-amino-2-hydroxybutyl]- L -lysine, the reduction product A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous. The systematic name of this enzyme class is deoxyhypusine,hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (2-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include deoxyhypusine hydroxylase , and deoxyhypusine dioxygenase .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
