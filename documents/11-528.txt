Phorbol-diester hydrolase

In enzymology, a phorbol-diester hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

phorbol 12,13-dibutanoate + H2O 
 
 
 
  phorbol 13-butanoate + butanoate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are phorbol 12,13-dibutanoate and H2O, whereas its two products are phorbol 13-butanoate and butanoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 12,13-diacylphorbate 12-acylhydrolase. Other names in common use include diacylphorbate 12-hydrolase, diacylphorbate 12-hydrolase, phorbol-12,13-diester 12-ester hydrolase, and PDEH.
