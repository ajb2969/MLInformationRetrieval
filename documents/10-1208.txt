Gluconate 2-dehydrogenase (acceptor)

In enzymology, a gluconate 2-dehydrogenase (acceptor) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-gluconate + acceptor 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-D-gluconate + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-gluconate and acceptor, whereas its two products are 2-dehydro-D-gluconate and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-gluconate:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include gluconate oxidase, gluconate dehydrogenase, gluconic dehydrogenase, D-gluconate dehydrogenase, gluconic acid dehydrogenase, 2-ketogluconate reductase, D-gluconate dehydrogenase, 2-keto-D-gluconate-yielding, and D-gluconate:(acceptor) 2-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
