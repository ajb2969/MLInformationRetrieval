   Normal variance-mean mixture      Normal variance-mean mixture   In probability theory and statistics , a normal variance-mean mixture with mixing probability density   g   g   g   is the continuous probability distribution of a random variable   Y   Y   Y   of the form       Y  =   α  +   β  V   +   σ   V   X     ,      Y    α    β  V     σ    V   X      Y=\alpha+\beta V+\sigma\sqrt{V}X,     where   α   α   \alpha   ,   β   β   \beta   and    σ  >  0      σ  0    \sigma>0   are real numbers, and random variables   X   X   X   and   V   V   V   are independent ,   X   X   X   is normally distributed with mean zero and variance one, and   V   V   V   is continuously distributed on the positive half-axis with probability density function    g   g   g   . The conditional distribution of   Y   Y   Y   given   V   V   V   is thus a normal distribution with mean    α  +   β  V       α    β  V     \alpha+\beta V   and variance     σ  2   V       superscript  σ  2   V    \sigma^{2}V   . A normal variance-mean mixture can be thought of as the distribution of a certain quantity in an inhomogeneous population consisting of many different normal distributed subpopulations. It is the distribution of the position of a Wiener process (Brownian motion) with drift   β   β   \beta   and infinitesimal variance    σ  2     superscript  σ  2    \sigma^{2}   observed at a random time point independent of the Wiener process and with probability density function   g   g   g   . An important example of normal variance-mean mixtures is the generalised hyperbolic distribution in which the mixing distribution is the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution .  The probability density function of a normal variance-mean mixture with mixing probability density    g   g   g   is       f   (  x  )    =    ∫  0  ∞     1    2  π   σ  2   v      exp   (    -    (   x  -  α  -   β  v    )   2     2   σ  2   v    )    g   (  v  )   d  v          f  x     superscript   subscript   0         1      2  π   superscript  σ  2   v            superscript    x  α    β  v    2      2   superscript  σ  2   v     g  v  d  v      f(x)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^{2}v}}\exp\left(\frac{-(x-%
 \alpha-\beta v)^{2}}{2\sigma^{2}v}\right)g(v)\,dv     and its moment generating function is        M   (  s  )    =    exp   (   α  s   )     M  g    (    β  s   +    1  2    σ  2    s  2     )     ,        M  s         α  s     subscript  M  g       β  s       1  2    superscript  σ  2    superscript  s  2        M(s)=\exp(\alpha s)\,M_{g}\left(\beta s+\frac{1}{2}\sigma^{2}s^{2}\right),     where    M  g     subscript  M  g    M_{g}   is the moment generating function of the probability distribution with density function   g   g   g   , i.e.         M  g    (  s  )    =   E   (   exp   (   s  V   )    )    =    ∫  0  ∞     exp   (   s  v   )    g   (  v  )   d  v     .           subscript  M  g   s     E      s  V            superscript   subscript   0           s  v    g  v  d  v       M_{g}(s)=E\left(\exp(sV)\right)=\int_{0}^{\infty}\exp(sv)g(v)\,dv.
