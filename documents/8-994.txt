Normal variance-mean mixture

In probability theory and statistics, a normal variance-mean mixture with mixing probability density 
 
 
 
  is the continuous probability distribution of a random variable 
 
 
 
  of the form



where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are real numbers, and random variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent, 
 
 
 
  is normally distributed with mean zero and variance one, and 
 
 
 
  is continuously distributed on the positive half-axis with probability density function

 
 . The conditional distribution of 
 
 
 
  given 
 
 
 
  is thus a normal distribution with mean 
 
 
 
  and variance 
 
 
 
 . A normal variance-mean mixture can be thought of as the distribution of a certain quantity in an inhomogeneous population consisting of many different normal distributed subpopulations. It is the distribution of the position of a Wiener process (Brownian motion) with drift 
 
 
 
  and infinitesimal variance 
 
 
 
  observed at a random time point independent of the Wiener process and with probability density function 
 
 
 
 . An important example of normal variance-mean mixtures is the generalised hyperbolic distribution in which the mixing distribution is the generalized inverse Gaussian distribution.
The probability density function of a normal variance-mean mixture with mixing probability density

 
  is



and its moment generating function is



where 
 
 
 
  is the moment generating function of the probability distribution with density function 
 
 
 
 , i.e.
