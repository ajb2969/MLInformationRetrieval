   Energy factor      Energy factor  An '''energy factor''' is a metric used in the [[United States]] to compare the [[ener gy conversion efficiency]] of residential appliances and equipment. The energy factor is currently used for rating the efficiency of water heaters , dishwashers , clothes washers , and clothes dryers . 1 The term is used by the United States Department of Energy to develop and enforce minimum energy conservation standards under the Energy Conservation Program . 2  Although the term energy factor is used to compare the relative efficiency of these appliances, the metric is defined differently for all four appliance categories. The energy factor is expressed in terms of site energy, which excludes losses through energy conversion . All of these efficiency metrics are defined by Department of Energy test procedures. 3  Water heaters  The energy factor metric only applies to residential water heaters, which are currently defined by fuel, type, and input capacity. 4      Residential water heaters   Fuel   Type   Input capacity     Natural Gas   Storage   ≤75 kBtu/h     Fuel Oil   Storage   ≤105 kBtu/h     Electric   Storage   ≤12 kW     Tabletop   Storage   ≤12 kW     Natural Gas   Instantaneous   <200 kBtu/hr     Electric   Instantaneous   ≤12 kW     Test procedure  (Figure)  The energy factor is determined using a stylized hot water use pattern. Hot water is drawn in six equal draws totaling 64.3 gallons, and a standby period of 18 hours follows.|right|thumb|400px   The energy factor for residential water heaters is determined using the results from the 24-hour simulated use test. During the test 64.3±1.0 gallons of water are drawn from the water heater in six equally spaced draws that begin one hour apart. The hot water flow rate for each draw is 3.0±0.25 gallons per minute. After the beginning of the last draw a standby period of 18 hours follows. During the test, the test conditions must be operated at a specified value and accuracy. Heat pump water heaters (HPWHs) have different values specified for ambient air temperature and relative humidity. 5      Specified test conditions   Measurement   Required value and accuracy     Inlet water temperature   58°F±2°F     Outlet water temperature   135°F±5°F     Ambient air temperature   67.5°F±2.5°F     Ambient air temperature (HPWHs only)   67.5°F±1°F     Ambient relative humidity (HPWHs only)   50%±1%     From the standard test procedure, the energy factor is defined as        E  F   =    ∑   i  =  1   6      M  i    C   p  i     (     135  ∘   F   -    58  ∘   F    )     Q   d  m       ,        E  F     superscript   subscript     i  1    6        subscript  M  i    subscript  C    p  i         superscript  135    F      superscript  58    F      subscript  Q    d  m        EF=\sum\limits_{i=1}^{6}\frac{M_{i}C_{pi}\left(135^{\circ}F-58^{\circ}F\right)%
 }{Q_{dm}},   where    Q   d  m      subscript  Q    d  m     Q_{dm}   is the modified daily water heating energy consumption (Btu),    M  i     subscript  M  i    M_{i}   is the mass withdrawn from the i th draw (lb), and    C   p  i      subscript  C    p  i     C_{pi}   is the specific heat of the water of the i th draw Btu/lb°F.  Energy conservation standards  Minimum federal energy conservation standards are defined by fuel, type, and rated storage volume. All standards are calculated as a function of the rated storage volume V in gallons. The current conservation standards are less efficient than the standards that go into effect in 2015. 6 7 8      Energy Conservation Standards   Fuel   Type   Rated Storage Volume   Energy Factor (Effective April 16, 2015)   Energy Factor     Natural Gas   Storage   ≥ 20 gal and ≤ 55 gal   0.675 − 0.0015V   0.67 − 0.0019V     Natural Gas   Storage   > 55 gal and ≤ 100 gal   0.8012 − 0.00078V   0.67 − 0.0019V     Fuel Oil   Storage   ≤ 50 gal   0.68 − 0.0019V   0.59 − 0.0019V     Electric   Storage   ≥ 20 gal and ≤ 55 gal   0.960 − 0.0003V   0.97 − 0.00132V     Electric   Storage   > 55 gal and ≤ 120 gal   2.057 − 0.00113V   0.97 − 0.00132V     Tabletop   Storage   ≥ 20 gal and ≤ 100 gal   0.93 − 0.00132V   0.93 − 0.00132V     Natural Gas   Instantaneous   < 2 gal   0.82 − 0.0019V   0.62 − 0.0019V     Electric   Instantaneous   < 2 gal   0.93 − 0.00132V   0.93 − 0.00132V     Dishwashers  The energy factor for dishwashers is defined as "the number of cycles per kWh of input power." 9  Clothes washers  The energy factor for clothes washers, is defined as "the cubic foot capacity per kWh of input power per cycle." 10  Clothes dryers  The energy factor for clothes dryers is defined as "the number of pounds of clothes dried per kWh of power consumed." 11  See also   Energy star   References  "  Category:Energy conversion     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩
