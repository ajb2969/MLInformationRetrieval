   Quadratic differential      Quadratic differential   In mathematics , a quadratic differential on a Riemann surface is a section of the symmetric square of the holomorphic cotangent bundle . If the section is holomorphic, then the quadratic differential is said to be holomorphic. The vector space of holomorphic quadratic differentials on a Riemann surface has a natural interpretation as the cotangent space to the Riemann moduli space or Teichmueller space .  Local form  Each quadratic differential on a domain   U   U   U   in the complex plane may be written as      f   (  z  )   d  z   ⊗  d   z       tensor-product    f  z  d  z   d   z    f(z)dz\otimes dz   where   z   z   z   is the complex variable and   f   f   f   is a complex valued function on   U   U   U   . Such a `local' quadratic differential is holomorphic if and only if   f   f   f   is holomorphic . Given a chart   μ   μ   \mu   for a general Riemann surface   R   R   R   and a quadratic differential   q   q   q   on   R   R   R   , the pull-back       (   μ   -  1    )   *    (  q  )        superscript   superscript  μ    1      q    (\mu^{-1})^{*}(q)   defines a quadratic differential on a domain in the complex plane.  Relation to abelian differentials  If   ω   ω   \omega   is an abelian differential on a Riemann surface, then    ω  ⊗  ω     tensor-product  ω  ω    \omega\otimes\omega   is a quadratic differential.  Singular Euclidean structure  A holomorphic quadratic differential   q   q   q   determines a Riemannian metric     |  q  |      q    |q|   on the complement of its zeroes. If   q   q   q   is defined on a domain in the complex plane and    q  =     f   (  z  )   d  z   ⊗  d   z       q     tensor-product    f  z  d  z   d   z     q=f(z)dz\otimes dz   , then the associated Riemannian metric is     |   f   (  z  )    |    (    d   x  2    +   d   y  2     )           f  z        d   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2       |f(z)|(dx^{2}+dy^{2})   where    z  =   x  +   i  y        z    x    i  y      z=x+iy   . Since   f   f   f   is holomorphic, the curvature of this metric is zero. Thus, a holomorphic quadratic differential defines a flat metric on the complement of the set of   z   z   z   such that     f   (  z  )    =  0        f  z   0    f(z)=0   .
