   27-hydroxycholesterol 7alpha-monooxygenase      27-hydroxycholesterol 7alpha-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a 27-hydroxycholesterol 7alpha-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   27-hydroxycholesterol + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   7alpha,27-dihydroxycholesterol + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are 27-hydroxycholesterol , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 7alpha,27-dihydroxycholesterol , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 27-hydroxycholesterol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (7alpha-hydroxylating) . This enzyme is also called 27-hydroxycholesterol 7alpha-hydroxylase . It employs one cofactor , heme-thiolate(P-450) .  References     "  Category:EC 1.14.13  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:Heme enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
