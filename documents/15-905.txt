Ferredoxin:protochlorophyllide reductase (ATP-dependent)

Ferredoxin:protochlorophyllide reductase (ATP-dependent) (, light-independent protochlorophyllide reductase) is an enzyme with system name ATP-dependent ferredoxin:protochlorophyllide-a 7,8-oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

chlorophyllide a + reduced ferredoxin + 2 ATP $\rightleftharpoons$ protochlorophyllide + oxidized ferredoxin + 2 ADP + 2 phosphate


This enzyme is present in photosynthetic bacteria, cyanobacteria, green algae and gymnosperms.
