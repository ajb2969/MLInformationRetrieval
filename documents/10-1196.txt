   Cholesterol oxidase      Cholesterol oxidase   In enzymology , a cholesterol oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cholesterol + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cholest-4-en-3-one + H 2 O 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cholesterol and O 2 , whereas its two products are cholest-4-en-3-one and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cholesterol:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include cholesterol- O2 oxidoreductase , 3beta-hydroxy steroid oxidoreductase , and 3beta-hydroxysteroid:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthesis .  The substrate-binding domain found in some bacterial cholesterol oxidases is composed of an eight-stranded mixed beta-pleated sheet and six alpha-helices . This domain is positioned over the isoalloxazine ring system of the FAD  cofactor bound by the FAD-binding domain and forms the roof of the active site cavity, allowing for catalysis of oxidation and isomerisation of cholesterol to cholest-4-en-3-one. 1  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 14 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
