Fukaya category

In symplectic topology, a discipline within mathematics, a Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold

 
  is a category

 
  whose objects are Lagrangian submanifolds of 
 
 
 
 , and morphisms are Floer chain groups

 
 . Its finer structure can be described in the language of quasi categories as an A∞-category.
They are named after Kenji Fukaya who introduced the 
 
 
 
  language first in the context of Morse homology, and exist in a number of variants. As Fukaya categories are A∞-categories, they have associated derived categories, which are the subject of a celebrated conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich: the homological mirror symmetry. This conjecture has been verified by computations for a variety of comparatively simple examples.
