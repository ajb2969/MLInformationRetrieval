   Fukaya category      Fukaya category   In symplectic topology , a discipline within mathematics, a Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold     (  M  ,  ω  )     M  ω    (M,\omega)   is a category     ℱ   (  M  )       ℱ  M    \mathcal{F}(M)   whose objects are Lagrangian submanifolds of   M   M   M   , and morphisms are Floer chain groups      Hom   (   L  0   ,   L  1   )    =   F  C   (   L  0   ,   L  1   )          Hom    subscript  L  0    subscript  L  1       F  C    subscript  L  0    subscript  L  1       \mathrm{Hom}(L_{0},L_{1})=FC(L_{0},L_{1})   . Its finer structure can be described in the language of quasi categories as an A ∞ -category .  They are named after Kenji Fukaya who introduced the    A  ∞     subscript  A     A_{\infty}   language first in the context of Morse homology , and exist in a number of variants. As Fukaya categories are A ∞ -categories , they have associated derived categories , which are the subject of a celebrated conjecture of Maxim Kontsevich : the homological mirror symmetry . This conjecture has been verified by computations for a variety of comparatively simple examples.  References   P.
