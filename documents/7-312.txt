Induced topology

In topology and related areas of mathematics, an induced topology on a topological space is a topology which is "optimal" for some function from/to this topological space.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be sets, 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a topology on 
 
 
 
 , then a topology coinduced on

by

 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is a topology on 
 
 
 
 , then a topology induced on

by

 
  is 
 
 
 
 .
The easy way to remember the definitions above is to notice that finding an inverse image is used in both. This is because inverse image preserves union and intersection. Finding a direct image does not preserve intersection in general. Here is an example where this becomes a hurdle. Consider a set 
 
 
 
  with a topology 
 
 
 
 , a set 
 
 
 
  and a function 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . A set of subsets 
 
 
 
  is not a topology, because 
 
 
 
  but 
 
 
 
 .
There are equivalent definitions below.
A topology 
 
 
 
  induced on 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  is the finest topology such that 
 
 
 
  is continuous

 
 . This is a particular case of the final topology on 
 
 
 
 .
A topology 
 
 
 
  induced on 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  is the coarsest topology such that 
 
 
 
  is continuous 
 
 
 
 . This is a particular case of the initial topology on 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

The quotient topology is the topology induced by the quotient map.
If 
 
 
 
  is an inclusion map, then 
 
 
 
  induces on 
 
 
 
  a subspace topology.
