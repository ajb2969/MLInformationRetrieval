   Induced topology      Induced topology   In topology and related areas of mathematics , an induced topology on a topological space is a topology which is "optimal" for some function from/to this topological space.  Definition  Let     X  0   ,   X  1       subscript  X  0    subscript  X  1     X_{0},X_{1}   be sets,    f  :    X  0   →   X  1       normal-:  f   normal-→   subscript  X  0    subscript  X  1      f:X_{0}\to X_{1}   .  If    τ  0     subscript  τ  0    \tau_{0}   is a topology on    X  0     subscript  X  0    X_{0}   , then a topology coinduced on     X  1     subscript  X  1    X_{1}    by    f   f   f   is    {    U  1   ⊆   X  1    |     f   -  1     (   U  1   )    ∈   τ  0    }     conditional-set     subscript  U  1    subscript  X  1         superscript  f    1     subscript  U  1     subscript  τ  0      \{U_{1}\subseteq X_{1}|f^{-1}(U_{1})\in\tau_{0}\}   .  If    τ  1     subscript  τ  1    \tau_{1}   is a topology on    X  1     subscript  X  1    X_{1}   , then a topology induced on     X  0     subscript  X  0    X_{0}    by    f   f   f   is    {    f   -  1     (   U  1   )    |    U  1   ∈   τ  1    }     conditional-set     superscript  f    1     subscript  U  1       subscript  U  1    subscript  τ  1      \{f^{-1}(U_{1})|U_{1}\in\tau_{1}\}   .  The easy way to remember the definitions above is to notice that finding an inverse image is used in both. This is because inverse image preserves union and intersection . Finding a direct image does not preserve intersection in general. Here is an example where this becomes a hurdle. Consider a set     X  0   =   {   -  2   ,   -  1   ,  1  ,  2  }        subscript  X  0      2     1   1  2     X_{0}=\{-2,-1,1,2\}   with a topology    {   {   -  2   ,   -  1   }   ,   {  1  ,  2  }   }        2     1     1  2     \{\{-2,-1\},\{1,2\}\}   , a set     X  1   =   {   -  1   ,  0  ,  1  }        subscript  X  1      1   0  1     X_{1}=\{-1,0,1\}   and a function    f  :    X  0   →   X  1       normal-:  f   normal-→   subscript  X  0    subscript  X  1      f:X_{0}\to X_{1}   such that      f   (   -  2   )    =   -  1    ,     f   (   -  1   )    =  0   ,     f   (  1  )    =  0   ,    f   (  2  )    =  1        formulae-sequence      f    2      1     formulae-sequence      f    1    0    formulae-sequence      f  1   0       f  2   1       f(-2)=-1,f(-1)=0,f(1)=0,f(2)=1   . A set of subsets     τ  1   =   {   f   (   U  0   )    |    U  0   ∈   τ  0    }        subscript  τ  1    conditional-set    f   subscript  U  0       subscript  U  0    subscript  τ  0       \tau_{1}=\{f(U_{0})|U_{0}\in\tau_{0}\}   is not a topology, because     {   {   -  1   ,  0  }   ,   {  0  ,  1  }   }   ⊆   τ  1           1   0    0  1     subscript  τ  1     \{\{-1,0\},\{0,1\}\}\subseteq\tau_{1}   but      {   -  1   ,  0  }   ∩   {  0  ,  1  }    ∉   τ  1            1   0    0  1     subscript  τ  1     \{-1,0\}\cap\{0,1\}\notin\tau_{1}   .  There are equivalent definitions below.  A topology    τ  1     subscript  τ  1    \tau_{1}   induced on    X  1     subscript  X  1    X_{1}   by   f   f   f   is the finest topology such that   f   f   f   is continuous      (   X  0   ,   τ  0   )   →   (   X  1   ,   τ  1   )      normal-→    subscript  X  0    subscript  τ  0      subscript  X  1    subscript  τ  1      (X_{0},\tau_{0})\to(X_{1},\tau_{1})   . This is a particular case of the final topology on    X  1     subscript  X  1    X_{1}   .  A topology    τ  0     subscript  τ  0    \tau_{0}   induced on    X  0     subscript  X  0    X_{0}   by   f   f   f   is the coarsest topology such that   f   f   f   is continuous     (   X  0   ,   τ  0   )   →   (   X  1   ,   τ  1   )      normal-→    subscript  X  0    subscript  τ  0      subscript  X  1    subscript  τ  1      (X_{0},\tau_{0})\to(X_{1},\tau_{1})   . This is a particular case of the initial topology on    X  0     subscript  X  0    X_{0}   .  Examples   The quotient topology is the topology induced by the quotient map.  If   f   f   f   is an inclusion map , then   f   f   f   induces on    X  0     subscript  X  0    X_{0}   a subspace topology .
