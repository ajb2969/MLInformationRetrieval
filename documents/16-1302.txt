In Euclidean plane geometry, the van Lamoen circle is a special circle associated with any given triangle

 
 . It contains the circumcenters of the six triangles that are defined inside 
 
 
 
  by its three medians.12
Specifically, let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be the vertices of 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be its centroid (the intersection of its three medians). Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be the midpoints of the sidelines 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. It turns out that the circumcenters of the six triangles 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  lie on a common circle, which is the van Lamoen circle of 
 
 
 
 .3
History
The van Lamoen circle is named after the mathematician Floor van Lamoen who posed it as a problem in 2000.45 A proof was provided by Kin Y. Li in 2001,6 and the editors of the Amer. Math. Monthly in 2002.78
Properties
The center of the van Lamoen circle is point 
 
 
 
  in Clark Kimberling's comprehensive list of triangle centers.9
In 2003, Alexey Myakishev and Peter Y. Woo proved that the converse of the theorem is nearly true, in the following sense: let 
 
 
 
  be any point in the triangle's interior, and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  be its cevians, that is, the line segments that connect each vertex to 
 
 
 
  and are extended until each meets the opposite side. Then the circumcenters of the six triangles 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  lie on the same circle if and only if 
 
 
 
  is the centroid of 
 
 
 
  or its orthocenter (the intersection of its three altitudes).10 A simpler proof of this result was given by Nguyen Minh Ha in 2005.11
