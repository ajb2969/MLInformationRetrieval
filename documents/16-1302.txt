   Van Lamoen circle      Van Lamoen circle   (Figure)  The van Lamoen circle through six circumcenters    A  b     subscript  A  b    A_{b}   ,    A  c     subscript  A  c    A_{c}   ,    B  c     subscript  B  c    B_{c}   ,    B  a     subscript  B  a    B_{a}   ,    C  a     subscript  C  a    C_{a}   ,    C  b     subscript  C  b    C_{b}      In Euclidean plane  geometry , the van Lamoen circle is a special circle associated with any given triangle    T   T   T   . It contains the circumcenters of the six triangles that are defined inside   T   T   T   by its three medians . 1 2  Specifically, let   A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   ,   C   C   C   be the vertices of   T   T   T   , and let   G   G   G   be its centroid (the intersection of its three medians). Let    M  a     subscript  M  a    M_{a}   ,    M  b     subscript  M  b    M_{b}   , and    M  c     subscript  M  c    M_{c}   be the midpoints of the sidelines    B  C      B  C    BC   ,    C  A      C  A    CA   , and    A  B      A  B    AB   , respectively. It turns out that the circumcenters of the six triangles    A  G   M  c       A  G   subscript  M  c     AGM_{c}   ,    B  G   M  c       B  G   subscript  M  c     BGM_{c}   ,    B  G   M  a       B  G   subscript  M  a     BGM_{a}   ,    C  G   M  a       C  G   subscript  M  a     CGM_{a}   ,    C  G   M  b       C  G   subscript  M  b     CGM_{b}   , and    A  G   M  b       A  G   subscript  M  b     AGM_{b}   lie on a common circle, which is the van Lamoen circle of   T   T   T   . 3  History  The van Lamoen circle is named after the mathematician Floor van Lamoen who posed it as a problem in 2000. 4 5 A proof was provided by Kin Y. Li in 2001, 6 and the editors of the Amer. Math. Monthly in 2002. 7 8  Properties  The center of the van Lamoen circle is point    X   (  1153  )       X  1153    X(1153)   in Clark Kimberling 's comprehensive list of triangle centers . 9  In 2003, Alexey Myakishev and Peter Y. Woo proved that the converse of the theorem is nearly true, in the following sense: let   P   P   P   be any point in the triangle's interior, and    A   A  ′       A   superscript  A  normal-′     AA^{\prime}   ,    B   B  ′       B   superscript  B  normal-′     BB^{\prime}   , and    C   C  ′       C   superscript  C  normal-′     CC^{\prime}   be its cevians , that is, the line segments that connect each vertex to   P   P   P   and are extended until each meets the opposite side. Then the circumcenters of the six triangles    A  P   B  ′       A  P   superscript  B  normal-′     APB^{\prime}   ,    A  P   C  ′       A  P   superscript  C  normal-′     APC^{\prime}   ,    B  P   C  ′       B  P   superscript  C  normal-′     BPC^{\prime}   ,    B  P   A  ′       B  P   superscript  A  normal-′     BPA^{\prime}   ,    C  P   A  ′       C  P   superscript  A  normal-′     CPA^{\prime}   , and    C  P   B  ′       C  P   superscript  B  normal-′     CPB^{\prime}   lie on the same circle if and only if   P   P   P   is the centroid of   T   T   T   or its orthocenter (the intersection of its three altitudes ). 10 A simpler proof of this result was given by Nguyen Minh Ha in 2005. 11  See also   Parry circle  Lester circle   References   12  13  14  15  16  17  18   "  Category:Euclidean geometry  Category:Theorems in geometry                Eric W.
