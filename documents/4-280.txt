   Conway's LUX method for magic squares      Conway's LUX method for magic squares   Conway's LUX method for magic squares is an algorithm by John Horton Conway for creating magic squares of order 4 n +2, where n is a natural number .  Method  Start by creating a (2 n +1)-by-(2 n +1) square array consisting of   n +1 rows of L s,  1 row of U s, and  n -1 rows of X s,   and then exchange the U in the middle with the L above it.  Each letter represents a 2x2 block of numbers in the finished square.  Now replace each letter by four consecutive numbers, starting with 1, 2, 3, 4 in the centre square of the top row, and moving from block to block in the manner of the Siamese method : move up and right, wrapping around the edges, and move down whenever you are obstructed. Fill each 2x2 block according to the order prescribed by the letter:      L  :     4       1         ↙         2    →    3     U  :     1       4      ↓       ↑      2    →    3     X  :     1       4           ↘  ↗          3       2        fragments  L  normal-:     4  absent  1    absent  normal-↙  absent    2  normal-→  3    italic-  U  normal-:     1  absent  4    normal-↓  absent  normal-↑    2  normal-→  3    italic-  X  normal-:     1  absent  4    absent   normal-↘  absent  normal-↗   absent    3  absent  2      \mathrm{L}:\quad\begin{smallmatrix}4&&1\\
 &\swarrow&\\
 2&\rightarrow&3\end{smallmatrix}\qquad\mathrm{U}:\quad\begin{smallmatrix}1&&4%
 \\
 \downarrow&&\uparrow\\
 2&\rightarrow&3\end{smallmatrix}\qquad\mathrm{X}:\quad\begin{smallmatrix}1&&4%
 \\
 &\searrow\!\!\!\!\!\!\nearrow&\\
 3&&2\end{smallmatrix}     Example  Let n = 2, so that the array is 5x5 and the final square is 10x10.
