   Bloch space      Bloch space   In the mathematical field of complex analysis , the Bloch space , named after Andr√© Bloch and denoted   ‚Ñ¨   ‚Ñ¨   \mathcal{B}   or ‚Ñ¨, is the space of holomorphic functions  f defined on the open  unit disc  D in the complex plane, such that the function       (   1  -    |  z  |   2    )    |    f  ‚Ä≤    (  z  )    |         1   superscript    z   2         superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤   z      (1-|z|^{2})|f^{\prime}(z)|     is bounded. 1    ‚Ñ¨   ‚Ñ¨   \mathcal{B}   is a Banach space , with the norm defined by         ‚à•  f  ‚à•   ‚Ñ¨   =    |   f   (  0  )    |   +    sup   z  ‚àà  ùêÉ      (   1  -    |  z  |   2    )    |    f  ‚Ä≤    (  z  )    |       .       subscript   norm  f   ‚Ñ¨         f  0      subscript  supremum    z  ùêÉ        1   superscript    z   2         superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤   z         \|f\|_{\mathcal{B}}=|f(0)|+\sup_{z\in\mathbf{D}}(1-|z|^{2})|f^{\prime}(z)|.     This is referred to as the Bloch norm and the elements of the Bloch space are called Bloch functions .  Notes  "  Category:Complex analysis     ‚Ü©
