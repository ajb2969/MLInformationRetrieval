Bloch space

In the mathematical field of complex analysis, the Bloch space, named after André Bloch and denoted 
 
 
 
  or ℬ, is the space of holomorphic functions f defined on the open unit disc D in the complex plane, such that the function



is bounded.1

 
  is a Banach space, with the norm defined by



This is referred to as the Bloch norm and the elements of the Bloch space are called Bloch functions.
