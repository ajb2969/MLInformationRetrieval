   Base (exponentiation)      Base (exponentiation)   (Figure)  Exponentiation of numbers 0-10. Line labels = base. X axis = power. Y axis = result.   In exponentiation , the base is the number b in an expression of the form b n .  Related terms  The number n is called the exponent and the expression is known formally as exponentiation of b by n or the exponential of n with base b . It is more commonly expressed as "the n th power of b ", " b to the n th power" or " b to the power n ". For example, the fourth power of 10 is 10,000 because 10 4 = 10 x 10 x 10 x 10 = 10,000. The term power strictly refers to the entire expression, but is sometimes used to refer to the exponent.  Roots  When the n th power of b equals a number a , or a = b n , then b is called an " n th root " of a . For example, 10 is a fourth root of 10,000.  Logarithms  The inverse function to exponentiation with base b (when it is well-defined ) is called the logarithm to base b , denoted log b . Thus:         log  b   a   =  n   .        subscript   b   a   n    \log_{b}a=n.\,     For example,      log  10   10000   =  4        subscript   10   10000   4    \log_{10}10000=4   .
