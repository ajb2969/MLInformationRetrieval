Summary
A thought experiment related to one discussed by J. S. Bell (see Bell's spaceship paradox). Two observers in Minkowski spacetime accelerate with constant magnitude 
 
 
 
  acceleration for proper time 
 
 
 
  (acceleration and elapsed time measured by the observers themselves, not some inertial observer). They are comoving and inertial before and after this phase. As Bell pointed out, in Minkowski geometry, the length of the spacelike line segment A′B″ turns out to be greater than the length of the spacelike line segment AB.
