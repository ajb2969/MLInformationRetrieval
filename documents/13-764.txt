   Klein cubic threefold      Klein cubic threefold   In algebraic geometry , the Klein cubic threefold is the non-singular cubic threefold in 4-dimensional projective space given by the equation         V  2   W   +    W  2   X   +    X  2   Y   +    Y  2   Z   +    Z  2   V    =   0            superscript  V  2   W      superscript  W  2   X      superscript  X  2   Y      superscript  Y  2   Z      superscript  Z  2   V    0    V^{2}W+W^{2}X+X^{2}Y+Y^{2}Z+Z^{2}V=0\,     studied by . Its automorphism group is the group PSL 2 (11) of order 660 . It is unirational but not a rational variety .  showed that it is birational to the moduli space of (1,11)-polarized abelian surfaces .
