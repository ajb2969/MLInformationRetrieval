   Characteristic admittance      Characteristic admittance    Characteristic admittance is the mathematical inverse of the characteristic impedance . The general expression for the characteristic admittance of a transmission line is:       Y  0   =     G  +   j  ω  C     R  +   j  ω  L           subscript  Y  0         G    j  ω  C      R    j  ω  L        Y_{0}=\sqrt{\frac{G+j\omega C}{R+j\omega L}}   where     R   R   R   is the resistance per unit length,     L   L   L   is the inductance per unit length,     G   G   G   is the conductance of the dielectric per unit length,     C   C   C   is the capacitance per unit length,     j   j   j   is the imaginary unit , and     ω   ω   \omega   is the angular frequency .  The current and voltage phasors on the line are related by the characteristic admittance as:        I  +    V  +    =   Y  0   =   -    I  -    V  -              superscript  I     superscript  V      subscript  Y  0             superscript  I     superscript  V         \frac{I^{+}}{V^{+}}=Y_{0}=-\frac{I^{-}}{V^{-}}   where the superscripts   +     +   and   -     -   represent forward- and backward-traveling waves, respectively.
