Characteristic admittance

 Characteristic admittance is the mathematical inverse of the characteristic impedance. The general expression for the characteristic admittance of a transmission line is:


 
  where


 
  is the resistance per unit length,


 
  is the inductance per unit length,


 
  is the conductance of the dielectric per unit length,


 
  is the capacitance per unit length,


 
  is the imaginary unit, and


 
  is the angular frequency.
The current and voltage phasors on the line are related by the characteristic admittance as:


 
  where the superscripts 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  represent forward- and backward-traveling waves, respectively.
