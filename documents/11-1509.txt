   GTP diphosphokinase      GTP diphosphokinase   In enzymology , a GTP diphosphokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + GTP   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and GTP , whereas its two products are AMP and guanosine 3'-diphosphate 5'-triphosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring two phosphorus-containing groups ( diphosphotransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:GTP 3'-diphosphotransferase . Other names in common use include stringent factor , guanosine 3',5'-polyphosphate synthase , GTP pyrophosphokinase , ATP-GTP 3'-diphosphotransferase , guanosine 5',3'-polyphosphate synthetase , (p)ppGpp synthetase I , (p)ppGpp synthetase II , guanosine pentaphosphate synthetase , GPSI , and GPSII . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 4 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , and .
