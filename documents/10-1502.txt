   Leucine dehydrogenase      Leucine dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a leucine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-leucine + H 2 O + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate + NH 3 + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-leucine , H 2 O , and NAD + , whereas its 4 products are 4-methyl-2-oxopentanoate , NH 3 , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-leucine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include L-leucine dehydrogenase , L-leucine:NAD+ oxidoreductase, deaminating , and LeuDH . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation and valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
