Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 6-phosphatase




Fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 6-phosphatase

In enzymology, a fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 6-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  beta-D-fructofuranose 2-phosphate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are beta-D-fructose 2,6-bisphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are beta-D-fructofuranose 2-phosphate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is beta-D-fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 6-phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include fructose 2,6-bisphosphate-6-phosphohydrolase, fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 6-phosphohydrolase, and D-fructose-2,6-bisphosphate 6-phosphohydrolase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
