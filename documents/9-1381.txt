   Atomic mass constant      Atomic mass constant   In physics and chemistry , the atomic mass constant , m u , is one twelfth of the mass of an unbound atom of carbon-12 at rest and in its ground state. 1 It serves to define the atomic mass unit and is, by definition, equal to 1 u. The 2010 CODATA recommended value is .  In practice, the atomic mass constant is determined as the ratio of the electron rest mass  m e to the electron relative atomic mass  A r (e) (that is, the mass of the electron on a scale where     12     12    {}^{12}   C = 12). 2 The relative atomic mass of the electron can be measured in cyclotron experiments, while the rest mass of the electron can be derived from other physical constants.       m  u   =    m  e     A  r    (  e  )     =    2   R  ∞   h     A  r    (  e  )   c   α  2            subscript  m  normal-u      subscript  m  normal-e      subscript  A  normal-r   normal-e             2   subscript  R    h      subscript  A  normal-r   normal-e  c   superscript  α  2        m_{\rm u}=\frac{m_{\rm e}}{A_{\rm r}({\rm e})}=\frac{2R_{\infty}h}{A_{\rm r}({%
 \rm e})c\alpha^{2}}   The current uncertainty in the value of the atomic mass constant – one part in 20 million – is almost entirely due to the uncertainty in the value of the Planck constant .  Energy equivalents  The atomic mass constant can also be expressed as its energy equivalent , that is m u c 2 . The 2010 CODATA recommended values are:        The megaelectronvolt (MeV) is commonly used as a unit of mass in particle physics , and these values are also important for the practical determination of relative atomic masses. Although relative atomic masses are defined for neutral atoms, they are measured (by mass spectrometry ) for ions: hence, the measured values must be correct for the mass of the electrons that were removed to form the ions, and also for the mass equivalent of the electron binding energy , E b / m u c 2 . The total binding energy of the six electrons in a carbon-12 atom is 1030.1089 eV = : E b / m u c 2 = , or about one part in 10 million of the mass of the atom. 3  See also   Atomic mass   References  External links   Atomic weights and isotopic compositions   "  Category:Amount of substance  Category:Physical constants     ↩  ↩  ↩
