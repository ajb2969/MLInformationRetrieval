23S rRNA (guanine2535-N1)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (guanine2535-N1)-methyltransferase (, AviRa) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine2535-N1)-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine2535 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methylguanine2535 in 23S rRNA
 

This is one of the methyltransferases from Streptomyces viridochromogenes .
