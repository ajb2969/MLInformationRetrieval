   23S rRNA (guanine2535-N1)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (guanine2535-N1)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (guanine 2535 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, AviRa ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanine 253 5-N 1 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 2535 in 23S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 -methylguanine 2535 in 23S rRNA   This is one of the methyltransferases from Streptomyces viridochromogenes .
