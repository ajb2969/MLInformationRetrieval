   Wilson polynomials      Wilson polynomials   In mathematics, Wilson polynomials are a family of orthogonal polynomials introduced by  that generalize Jacobi polynomials , Hahn polynomials , and Charlier polynomials .  They are defined in terms of the generalized hypergeometric function and the Pochhammer symbols by         p  n    (   t  2   )    =     (   a  +  b   )   n     (   a  +  c   )   n     (   a  +  d   )   n    F  3    4     (      -  n      a  ;     +  b   +  c  +  d  +  n   -  1        a  -  t   ;      a  ;   +  t         a  +  b      a  ;   +  c       a  ;   +  d       ;  1  )     .         subscript  p  n    superscript  t  2       subscript    a  b   n    subscript    a  c   n    subscript    a  d   n    subscript   subscript  F  3   4        n    a        b   c  d  n   1      a  t    a    t        a  b    a    c     a    d      1      p_{n}(t^{2})=(a+b)_{n}(a+c)_{n}(a+d)_{n}{}_{4}F_{3}\left(\begin{matrix}-n&a+b%
