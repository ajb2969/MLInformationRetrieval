   Representation on coordinate rings      Representation on coordinate rings   In mathematics, a representation on coordinate rings is a representation of a group on coordinate rings of affine varieties.  Let X be an affine algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field k of characteristic zero with the action of a reductive algebraic group  G . 1  G then acts on the coordinate ring    k   [  X  ]       k   delimited-[]  X     k[X]   of X as a left regular representation       (   g  ⋅  f   )    (  x  )    =   f   (    g   -  1    x   )           normal-⋅  g  f   x     f     superscript  g    1    x      (g\cdot f)(x)=f(g^{-1}x)   . This is a representation of G on the coordinate ring of X .  The most basic case is when X is an affine space (that is, X is a finite-dimensional representation of G ) and the coordinate ring is a polynomial ring. The most important case is when X is a symmetric variety ; i.e., the quotient of G by a fixed-point subgroup of an involution.  Isotypic decomposition  Let    k    [  X  ]    (  λ  )        k   subscript   delimited-[]  X   λ     k[X]_{(\lambda)}   be the sum of all G -submodules of    k   [  X  ]       k   delimited-[]  X     k[X]   that are isomorphic to the simple module    V  λ     superscript  V  λ    V^{\lambda}   ; it is called the   λ   λ   \lambda   - isotypic component of    k   [  X  ]       k   delimited-[]  X     k[X]   . Then there is a direct sum decomposition:       k   [  X  ]    =    ⊕  λ    k    [  X  ]    (  λ  )            k   delimited-[]  X      subscript  direct-sum  λ     k   subscript   delimited-[]  X   λ       k[X]=\bigoplus_{\lambda}k[X]_{(\lambda)}   where the sum runs over all simple G -modules    V  λ     superscript  V  λ    V^{\lambda}   . The existence of the decomposition follows, for example, from the fact that the group algebra of G is semisimple since G is reductive.  X is called multiplicity-free (or spherical variety 2 ) if every irreducible representation of G appears at most one time in the coordinate ring; i.e.,      dim  k     [  X  ]    (  λ  )     ≤   dim   V  λ           dim  k    subscript   delimited-[]  X   λ     dim   superscript  V  λ      \operatorname{dim}k[X]_{(\lambda)}\leq\operatorname{dim}V^{\lambda}   . For example,   G   G   G   is multiplicity-free as    G  ×  G      G  G    G\times G   -module. More precisely, given a closed subgroup H of G , define       ϕ  λ   :     V   λ  *    ⊗    (   V  λ   )   H    →   k    [   G  /  H   ]    (  λ  )         normal-:   subscript  ϕ  λ    normal-→   tensor-product   superscript  V   λ      superscript   superscript  V  λ   H      k   subscript   delimited-[]    G  H    λ       \phi_{\lambda}:V^{{\lambda}*}\otimes(V^{\lambda})^{H}\to k[G/H]_{(\lambda)}   by setting      ϕ  λ    (   α  ⊗  v   )    (   g  H   )    =   ⟨  α  ,   g  ⋅  v   ⟩          subscript  ϕ  λ    tensor-product  α  v     g  H     α   normal-⋅  g  v      \phi_{\lambda}(\alpha\otimes v)(gH)=\langle\alpha,g\cdot v\rangle   and then extending    ϕ  λ     subscript  ϕ  λ    \phi_{\lambda}   by linearity. The functions in the image of    ϕ  λ     subscript  ϕ  λ    \phi_{\lambda}   are usually called matrix coefficients . Then there is a direct sum decomposition of    G  ×  N      G  N    G\times N   -modules ( N the normalizer of H )       k   [   G  /  H   ]    =    ⊕  λ     ϕ  λ    (    V   λ  *    ⊗    (   V  λ   )   H    )           k   delimited-[]    G  H       subscript  direct-sum  λ      subscript  ϕ  λ    tensor-product   superscript  V   λ      superscript   superscript  V  λ   H        k[G/H]=\bigoplus_{\lambda}\phi_{\lambda}(V^{{\lambda}*}\otimes(V^{\lambda})^{H})   , which is an algebraic version of the Peter–Weyl theorem (and in fact the analytic version is an immediate consequence.) Proof: let W be a simple    G  ×  N      G  N    G\times N   -submodules of    k    [   G  /  H   ]    (  λ  )        k   subscript   delimited-[]    G  H    λ     k[G/H]_{(\lambda)}   . We can assume     V  λ   =  W       superscript  V  λ   W    V^{\lambda}=W   . Let    δ  1     subscript  δ  1    \delta_{1}   be the linear functional of W such that      δ  1    (  w  )    =   w   (  1  )           subscript  δ  1   w     w  1     \delta_{1}(w)=w(1)   . Then     w   (   g  H   )    =    ϕ  λ    (    δ  1   ⊗  w   )    (   g  H   )          w    g  H       subscript  ϕ  λ    tensor-product   subscript  δ  1   w     g  H      w(gH)=\phi_{\lambda}(\delta_{1}\otimes w)(gH)   . That is, the image of    ϕ  λ     subscript  ϕ  λ    \phi_{\lambda}   contains    k    [   G  /  H   ]    (  λ  )        k   subscript   delimited-[]    G  H    λ     k[G/H]_{(\lambda)}   and the opposite inclusion holds since    ϕ  λ     subscript  ϕ  λ    \phi_{\lambda}   is equivariant.  Examples   Let     v  λ   ∈   V  λ        subscript  v  λ    superscript  V  λ     v_{\lambda}\in V^{\lambda}   be a B -eigenvector and X the closure of the orbit    G  ⋅   v  λ      normal-⋅  G   subscript  v  λ     G\cdot v_{\lambda}   . It is an affine variety called the highest weight vector variety by Vinberg–Popov. It is multiplicity-free.
