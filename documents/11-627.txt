   NAD+ nucleosidase      NAD+ nucleosidase   In enzymology , a NAD + nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP-ribose + nicotinamide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are NAD + and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ADP-ribose and nicotinamide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NAD + glycohydrolase . Other names in common use include NADase , DPNase , DPN hydrolase , NAD hydrolase , diphosphopyridine nucleosidase , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nucleosidase , NAD glycohydrolase , NAD nucleosidase , and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide glycohydrolase . This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism and calcium signaling pathway .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 25 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
