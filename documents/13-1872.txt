   Ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate      Ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate   Ruthenium(III) acetylacetonate is a coordination complex with the formula Ru (O 2 C 5 H 7 ) 3 . O 2 C 5 H 7 ) 3 is the ligand called acetylacetonate . This compound exists as a dark violet solid that is soluble in most organic solvents. 1 It is used as a precursor to other compounds of ruthenium.  Preparation  In 1914 tris(acetylacetonato)ruthenium (III) was first prepared by the reaction of ruthenium(III) chloride and acetylacetone in the presence of potassium bicarbonate . 2 Since then, alternative synthetic routes have been examined, but the original procedure remains useful with minor variations: 3   RuCl 3 •3H 2 O + MeCOCH 2 COMe → Ru(acac) 3 + 3 HCl + 3 H 2 O   Structure and properties  This compound has idealized D 3 symmetry. Six oxygen atoms surround the central ruthenium atom in an octahedral arrangement. The average Ru-O bond length in Ru(acac) 3 is 2.00 Å. 4 Because Ru(acac) 3 is low spin, there is one unpaired d electron, causing this compound to be paramagnetic. Ru(acac) 3 has a magnetic susceptibility, χ M , of 3.032×10 −6 cm 3 /mol with an effective magnetic moment, μ eff , of 1.66 μ B . 5 As a solution in DMF , the compound oxidizes at 0.593 and reduces at -1.223 V vs the ferrocene / ferrocenium couple. 6  Reduction of Ru(acac) 3 in the presence of alkenes affords the related diolefin complexes. Typically, such reactions are conducted with zinc  amalgam in moist tetrahydrofuran : 7   2 Ru(acac) 3 + 4 alkene + Zn → 2 Ru(acac) 2 (alkene) 2 + Zn(acac) 2    The resulting compounds are rare examples of metal-alkene complexes that reversibly sustain oxidation:   Ru(acac) 2 (alkene) 2     ←  →     normal-→  normal-←    \overrightarrow{\leftarrow}   [Ru(acac) 2 (alkene) 2 ] + + e −    References  "  Category:Ruthenium compounds  Category:Acetylacetonate complexes     R.C.
