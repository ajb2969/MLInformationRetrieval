   Ferredoxin—NAD(+) reductase      Ferredoxin—NAD(+) reductase   In enzymology , a ferredoxin–NAD + reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction :   reduced ferredoxin + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxidized ferredoxin + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are reduced ferredoxin and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are oxidized ferredoxin , NADH , and H + . This enzyme participates in fatty acid metabolism .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on iron-sulfur proteins as donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor.  The systematic name of this enzyme is ferredoxin:NAD + oxidoreductase . There are a variety of names in common use:   ferredoxin–nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide reductase  ferredoxin reductase  NAD + -ferredoxin reductase  ferredoxin–NAD + reductase  ferredoxin–linked NAD + reductase  ferredoxin–NAD reductase   When NAD molecule is in its reduced form, the enzyme is referred to as:   NADH-ferredoxin oxidoreductase  reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide-ferredoxin  NADH-ferredoxin reductase  NADH flavodoxin oxidoreductase  NADH 2 -ferredoxin oxidoreductase   Other enzymes in the family include:   NADH-ferredoxin NAP reductase (component of naphthalene dioxygenase multicomponent enzyme system)  NADH-ferredoxin TOL reductase (component of toluene dioxygenase)   Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
