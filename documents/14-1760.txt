   Kasch ring      Kasch ring   In ring theory , a subfield of abstract algebra , a right Kasch ring is a ring R for which every simple right R  module is isomorphic to a right ideal of R . 1 Analogously the notion of a left Kasch ring is defined, and the two notions are independent of each other.  Kasch rings are named in honor of mathematician Friedrich Kasch . Kasch originally called Artinian rings whose proper ideals have nonzero annihilators  S-rings .  The characterizations below show that Kasch rings generalize S-rings.  Definition  Equivalent definitions will be introduced only for the right-hand version, with the understanding that the left-hand analogues are also true. The Kasch conditions have a few equivalences using the concept of annihilators , and this article uses the same notation appearing in the annihilator article.  In addition to the definition given in the introduction, the following properties are equivalent definitions for a ring R to be right Kasch. They appear in :   For every simple right R module S , there is a nonzero module homomorphism from M into R .  The maximal right ideals of R are right annihilators of ring elements, that is, each one is of the form    r  .   ann   (  x  )       formulae-sequence  normal-r    ann  x     \mathrm{r.ann}(x)\,   where x is in R .  For any maximal right ideal T of R ,    ℓ  .    ann   (  T  )    ≠   {  0  }       formulae-sequence  normal-ℓ      ann  T    0      \mathrm{\ell.ann}(T)\neq\{0\}   .  For any proper right ideal T of R ,    ℓ  .    ann   (  T  )    ≠   {  0  }       formulae-sequence  normal-ℓ      ann  T    0      \mathrm{\ell.ann}(T)\neq\{0\}   .  For any maximal right ideal T of R ,    r  .  ann   (  ℓ  .  ann   (  T  )   )   =  T     fragments  r  normal-.  ann   fragments  normal-(  ℓ  normal-.  ann   fragments  normal-(  T  normal-)   normal-)    T    \mathrm{r.ann}(\mathrm{\ell.ann}(T))=T   .  R has no dense right ideals except R itself.   Examples  The content below can be found in references such as , , .   Let R be a semiprimary ring with Jacobson radical  J . If R is commutative, or if R / J is a simple ring , then R is right (and left) Kasch. In particular, commutative Artinian rings are right and left Kasch.    For a division ring k , consider a certain subring R of the four-by-four matrix ring with entries from k . The subring R consists of matrices of the following form:     \begin{bmatrix}     a & 0 & b & c \\ 0 & a & 0 & d \\ 0 & 0 & a & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & e \end{bmatrix}   This is a right and left Artinian ring which is right Kasch, but not left Kasch.    Let S be the ring of power series on two noncommuting variables X and Y with coefficients from a field F . Let the ideal A be the ideal generated by the two elements YX and Y 2 . The quotient ring  S / A is a local ring which is right Kasch but not left Kasch.  Suppose R is a ring direct product of infinitely many nonzero rings labeled A k . The direct sum of the A k forms a proper ideal of R . It is easily checked that the left and right annihilators of this ideal are zero, and so R is not right or left Kasch.  The two-by-two upper (or lower) triangular matrix ring is not right or left Kasch.  A ring with right socle zero (i.e.     soc   (   R  R   )    =   {  0  }         soc   subscript  R  R     0     \mathrm{soc}(R_{R})=\{0\}   ) cannot be right Kasch, since the ring contains no minimal right ideals . So, for example, domains which are not division rings are not right or left Kasch.
