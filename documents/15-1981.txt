Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate synthase

Cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate synthase (, MOCS1A, MoaA, MoaC, molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis protein 1) is an enzyme with system name GTP 8,9-lyase (cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate-forming).1234567 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

GTP 
 
 
 
  cyclic pyranopterin monophosphate + diphosphate


This enzyme catalyses an early step in the biosynthesis of the molybdenum cofactor.
