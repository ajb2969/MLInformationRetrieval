Metanilpotent group

In mathematics, in the field of group theory, a metanilpotent group is a group that is nilpotent by nilpotent. In other words, it has a normal nilpotent subgroup such that the quotient group is also nilpotent.
In symbols, 
 
 
 
  is metanilpotent if there is a normal subgroup

 
  such that both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are nilpotent.
The following are clear:

Every metanilpotent group is a solvable group.
Every subgroup and every quotient of a metanilpotent group is metanilpotent.
