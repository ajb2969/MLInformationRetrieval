   Burning Ship fractal      Burning Ship fractal     The Burning Ship fractal , first described and created by Michael Michelitsch and Otto E. Rössler in 1992, is generated by iterating the function:        z   n  +  1    =     (   |     Re   (   z  n   )     |   +  i   |     Im   (   z  n   )     |   )   2   +  c    ,    z  0   =  0      formulae-sequence     subscript  z    n  1       superscript        Re   subscript  z  n        i      Im   subscript  z  n      2   c       subscript  z  0   0     z_{n+1}=(|\operatorname{Re}\left(z_{n}\right)|+i|\operatorname{Im}\left(z_{n}%
 \right)|)^{2}+c,\quad z_{0}=0     in the complex plane    ℂ   ℂ   \mathbb{C}   which will either escape or remain bounded. The difference between this calculation and that for the Mandelbrot set is that the real and imaginary components are set to their respective absolute values before squaring at each iteration. The mapping is non-analytic because its real and imaginary parts do not obey the Cauchy–Riemann equations . 1  References  External links   About properties and symmetries of the Burning Ship fractal , featured by Theory.org  Burning Ship Fractal , Description and C source code.
