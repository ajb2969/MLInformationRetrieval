Troland

The troland (symbol Td), named after Leonard T. Troland, is a unit of conventional retinal illuminance. It is meant as a method for correcting photometric measurements of luminance values impinging on the human eye by scaling them by the effective pupil size. It is equal to retinal illuminance produced by a surface whose luminance is one nit when the apparent area of the entrance pupil of the eye is 1 square millimeter.1
The troland typically refers to the ordinary or photopic troland, which is defined in terms of the photopic luminance:


 
 ,
where L is the photopic luminance in cd m−2 and p is pupil area in mm2.
A scotopic troland is also sometimes defined:


 
 ,
where L′ is the scotopic luminance in cd m−2 and p is pupil area in mm2.
