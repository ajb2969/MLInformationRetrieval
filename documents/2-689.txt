   Common logarithm      Common logarithm   (Figure)  The common logarithm.   In mathematics , the common logarithm is the logarithm with base 10. It is also known as the decadic logarithm and also as the decimal logarithm , named after its base, or Briggsian logarithm , after Henry Briggs , an English mathematician who pioneered its use. It is indicated by log 10 ( x ), or sometimes Log( x ) with a capital L (however, this notation is ambiguous since it can also mean the complex natural logarithmic multi-valued function ). On calculators it is usually "log", but mathematicians usually mean natural logarithm rather than common logarithm when they write "log". To mitigate this ambiguity the ISO specification is that log 10 ( x ) should be lg ( x ) and log e ( x ) should be ln ( x ).  Uses  Before the early 1970s, handheld electronic calculators were not yet in widespread use. Due to their utility in saving work in laborious multiplications and divisions with pen and paper, tables of base 10 logarithms were given in appendices of many books. Such a table of "common logarithms" gave the logarithm, often to 4 or 5 decimal places, of each number in the left-hand column, which ran from 1 to 10 by small increments, perhaps 0.01 or 0.001. There was only a need to include numbers between 1 and 10, since the logarithms of larger numbers can then be easily derived.  For example, the logarithm of 120 is given by:        log  10   120   =    log  10    (    10  2   ×  1.2   )    =   2  +    log  10   1.2    ≈   2  +  0.079181.           subscript   10   120     subscript   10      superscript  10  2   1.2           2    subscript   10   1.2           2  0.079181.      \log_{10}120=\log_{10}(10^{2}\times 1.2)=2+\log_{10}1.2\approx 2+0.079181.     The last number (0.079181)—the fractional part of the logarithm of 120, known as the mantissa of the common logarithm of 120—was found in the table. 1 The location of the decimal point in 120 tells us that the integer part of the common logarithm of 120, called the characteristic of the common logarithm of 120, is 2.  Numbers between (and excluding) 0 and 1 have negative logarithms. For example,        log  10   0.012   =    log  10    (    10   -  2    ×  1.2   )    =    -  2   +    log  10   1.2    ≈    -  2   +  0.079181   =   -  1.920819           subscript   10   0.012     subscript   10      superscript  10    2    1.2             2     subscript   10   1.2             2   0.079181          1.920819      \log_{10}0.012=\log_{10}(10^{-2}\times 1.2)=-2+\log_{10}1.2\approx-2+0.079181=%
 -1.920819     To avoid the need for separate tables to convert positive and negative logarithms back to their original numbers, a bar notation is used:        log  10   0.012   ≈    -  2   +  0.079181   =    2  ¯   .079181           subscript   10   0.012       2   0.079181           normal-¯  2   .079181      \log_{10}0.012\approx-2+0.079181=\bar{2}.079181     The bar over the characteristic indicates that it is negative whilst the mantissa remains positive. When reading a number in bar notation out loud, the symbol    n  ¯     normal-¯  n    \bar{n}   is read as "bar n", so that     2  ¯   .079181       normal-¯  2   .079181    \bar{2}.079181   is read as "bar 2 point 07918...".

Note that the mantissa is common to all of the 5×10 i . This holds for any positive real number    x   x   x   because:       log  10    (   x  ×   10  i    )    =     log  10    (  x  )    +    log  10    (   10  i   )     =     log  10    (  x  )    +  i           subscript   10     x   superscript  10  i         subscript   10   x     subscript   10    superscript  10  i              subscript   10   x   i      \log_{10}(x\times 10^{i})=\log_{10}(x)+\log_{10}(10^{i})=\log_{10}(x)+i   . Since   i   i   i   is always an integer the mantissa comes from     log  10    (  x  )       subscript   10   x    \log_{10}(x)   which is constant for given   x   x   x   . This allows a table of logarithms to include only one entry for each mantissa. In the example of 5×10 i , 0.698 970 (004 336 018 ...) will be listed once indexed by 5, or 0.5, or 500 etc..  The following example uses the bar notation to calculate 0.012 × 0.85 = 0.0102:        As found above,       log  10   0.012   ≈    2  ¯   .079181           Since     log  10   0.85        =    log  10    (    10   -  1    ×  8.5   )    =    -  1   +    log  10   8.5          ≈    -  1   +  0.929419   =    1  ¯    .929419     ,         log  10    (   0.012  ×  0.85   )        =     log  10   0.012   +    log  10   0.85         ≈     2  ¯   .079181   +    1  ¯   .929419            =    (    -  2   +  0.079181   )   +   (    -  1   +  0.929419   )         =    -   (   2  +  1   )    +   (   0.079181  +  0.929419   )            =    -  3   +  1.008600        =    -  2   +    0.008600   *            ≈     log  10    (   10   -  2    )    +    log  10    (  1.02  )          =    log  10    (   0.01  ×  1.02   )            =    log  10    (  0.0102  )            As found above,      subscript   10   0.012      normal-¯  2   .079181     missing-subexpression       Since    subscript   10   0.85        absent    subscript   10      superscript  10    1    8.5             1     subscript   10   8.5          absent      1   0.929419           normal-¯  1   .929419         subscript   10     0.012  0.85      absent      subscript   10   0.012     subscript   10   0.85       absent       normal-¯  2   .079181      normal-¯  1   .929419        missing-subexpression     absent        2   0.079181       1   0.929419       absent        2  1      0.079181  0.929419        missing-subexpression     absent      3   1.008600      absent      2    superscript  0.008600         missing-subexpression     absent      subscript   10    superscript  10    2       subscript   10   1.02       absent    subscript   10     0.01  1.02        missing-subexpression     absent    subscript   10   0.0102     missing-subexpression      \begin{array}[]{rll}\text{As found above,}&\log_{10}0.012\approx\bar{2}.079181%

(Figure)  Numbers are placed on slide rule scales at distances proportional to the differences between their logarithms. By mechanically adding the distance from 1 to 2 on the lower scale to the distance from 1 to 3 on the upper scale, one can quickly determine that 2 x 3 = 6.   History  Common logarithms are sometimes also called "Briggsian logarithms" after Henry Briggs , a 17th-century British mathematician.  Because base 10 logarithms were most useful for computations, engineers generally simply wrote "log( x )" when they meant log 10 ( x ). Mathematicians, on the other hand, wrote "log( x )" when they meant log e ( x ) for the natural logarithm. Today, both notations are found. Since hand-held electronic calculators are designed by engineers rather than mathematicians, it became customary that they follow engineers' notation. So the notation, according to which one writes "ln( x )" when the natural logarithm is intended, may have been further popularized by the very invention that made the use of "common logarithms" far less common, electronic calculators.  Numeric value  The numerical value for logarithm to the base 10 can be calculated with the following identity.         log  10    (  x  )    =     ln   (  x  )     ln   (  10  )     or       log  10    (  x  )    =     log  2    (  x  )      log  2    (  10  )         formulae-sequence      subscript   10   x        x     10    or        subscript   10   x       subscript   2   x     subscript   2   10       \log_{10}(x)=\frac{\ln(x)}{\ln(10)}\qquad\text{ or }\qquad\log_{10}(x)=\frac{%
 \log_{2}(x)}{\log_{2}(10)}     as procedures exist for determining the numerical value for logarithm base e and logarithm base 2 .
