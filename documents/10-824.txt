   Quercetin 3-O-methyltransferase      Quercetin 3-O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a quercetin 3-O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 3-methoxy-5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavone , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and 3-methoxy-5,7,3',4'-tetrahydroxyflavone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:3,5,7,3',4'-pentahydroxyflavone 3-O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include flavonol 3-O-methyltransferase , and flavonoid 3-methyltransferase . This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis .
