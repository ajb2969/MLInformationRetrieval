   Representation up to homotopy      Representation up to homotopy   A Representation up to homotopy is a concept in differential geometry that generalizes the notion of representation of a Lie algebra to Lie algebroids and nontrivial vector bundles . It was introduced by Abad and Crainic. 1  As a motivation consider a regular Lie algebroid ( A , ρ ,[.,.]) (regular meaning that the anchor ρ has constant rank) where we have two natural A - connections on g ( A ) = ker ρ and ν ( A )= TM /im ρ respectively:       ∇  :      Γ   (  A  )    ×  Γ    (   𝔤   (  A  )    )    →   Γ   (   𝔤   (  A  )    )     :     ∇   ϕ    ψ   :=   [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]     ,       normal-:  normal-∇   normal-→        normal-Γ  A   normal-Γ     𝔤  A      normal-Γ    𝔤  A       normal-:     assign    subscript  normal-∇  ϕ   ψ    ϕ  ψ       \nabla\colon\Gamma(A)\times\Gamma(\mathfrak{g}(A))\to\Gamma(\mathfrak{g}(A)):%

In the deformation theory of the Lie algebroid A there is a long exact sequence 2      …  →    H  n    (  A  ,   𝔤   (  A  )    )    →    H   d  e  f   n    (  A  )    →    H   n  -  1     (  A  ,   ν   (  A  )    )    →    H   n  -  1     (  A  ,   𝔤   (  A  )    )    →  …       normal-→  normal-…     superscript  H  n    A    𝔤  A       normal-→       subscript   superscript  H  n     d  e  f    A     normal-→       superscript  H    n  1     A    ν  A       normal-→       superscript  H    n  1     A    𝔤  A       normal-→    normal-…     \dots\to H^{n}(A,\mathfrak{g}(A))\to H^{n}_{def}(A)\to H^{n-1}(A,\nu(A))\to H^%
 {n-1}(A,\mathfrak{g}(A))\to\dots   This suggests that the correct cohomology for the deformations (here denoted as H def ) comes from the direct sum of the two modules g ( A ) and ν ( A ) and should be called adjoint representation . Note however that in the more general case where ρ does not have constant rank we cannot easily define the representations g ( A ) and ν ( A ). Instead we should consider the 2-term complex A → TM and a representation on it. This leads to the notion explained here.  Definition  Let ( A , ρ ,[.,.]) be a Lie algebroid over a smooth manifold M and let Ω( A ) denote its Lie algebroid complex. Let further E be a ℤ-graded vector bundle over M and Ω( A , E ) = Ω( A ) ⊗ Γ( E ) be its ℤ-graded A -cochains with values in E . A representation up to homotopy of A on E is a differential operator D that maps       D  :     Ω  ∙    (  A  ,  E  )    →    Ω    ∙   +  1      (  A  ,  E  )      ,     normal-:  D   normal-→     superscript  normal-Ω  normal-∙    A  E       superscript  normal-Ω   normal-∙  absent    1      A  E       D\colon\Omega^{\bullet}(A,E)\to\Omega^{\bullet+1}(A,E),     fulfills the Leibniz rule        D   (   α  ∧  β   )    =      (   D  α   )   ∧  β   +     (   -  1   )    |  α  |    α    ∧   (   D  β   )     ,        D    α  β            D  α   β      superscript    1     α    α      D  β      D(\alpha\wedge\beta)=(D\alpha)\wedge\beta+(-1)^{|\alpha|}\alpha\wedge(D\beta),     and squares to zero, i.e. D 2 = 0.  Homotopy operators  A representation up to homotopy as introduced above is equivalent to the following data   a degree 1 operator ∂: E → E that squares to 0,  an A -connection ∇ on E compatible as     ∇  ∘  ∂   =   ∂  ∘  ∇         normal-∇       normal-∇     \nabla\circ\partial=\partial\circ\nabla   ,  an End( E )-valued A -2-form ω 2 of total degree 1, such that the curvature fulfills       ∂   ω  2    +   R  ∇    =  0   ,           subscript  ω  2     subscript  R  normal-∇    0    \partial\omega_{2}+R_{\nabla}=0,     End( E )-valued A - p -forms ω p of total degree 1 that fulfill the homotopy relations….   The correspondence is characterized as       D  =   ∂  +  ∇  +   ω  2   +   ω  3   +  ⋯    .      D     normal-∇   subscript  ω  2    subscript  ω  3   normal-⋯     D=\partial+\nabla+\omega_{2}+\omega_{3}+\cdots.\,     Homomorphisms  A homomorphism between representations up to homotopy ( E , D E ) and ( F , D F ) of the same Lie algebroid A is a degree 0 map Φ:Ω( A , E ) → Ω( A , F ) that commutes with the differentials, i.e.         D  E   ∘  Φ   =   Φ  ∘   D  E     .         subscript  D  E   normal-Φ     normal-Φ   subscript  D  E      D_{E}\circ\Phi=\Phi\circ D_{E}.\,     An isomorphism is now an invertible homomorphism. We denote Rep ∞ the category of equivalence classes of representations up to homotopy together with equivalence classes of homomorphisms.  In the sense of the above decomposition of D into a cochain map ∂, a connection ∇, and higher homotopies, we can also decompose the Φ as Φ 0 + Φ 1 + … with       Φ  i   ∈    Ω  i    (  A  ,    Hom   -  i     (  E  ,  F  )    )         subscript  normal-Φ  i      superscript  normal-Ω  i    A     superscript  Hom    i     E  F        \Phi_{i}\in\Omega^{i}(A,\mathrm{Hom}^{-i}(E,F))     and then the compatibility condition reads        ∂   Φ  n    +    d  ∇    (   Φ   n  -  1    )    +   [   ω  2   ,   Φ   n  -  2    ]   +  ⋯  +   [   ω  n   ,   Φ  0   ]    =  0.           subscript  normal-Φ  n       subscript  d  normal-∇    subscript  normal-Φ    n  1       subscript  ω  2    subscript  normal-Φ    n  2     normal-⋯    subscript  ω  n    subscript  normal-Φ  0     0.    \partial\Phi_{n}+d_{\nabla}(\Phi_{n-1})+[\omega_{2},\Phi_{n-2}]+\cdots+[\omega%
 _{n},\Phi_{0}]=0.     Examples  Examples are usual representations of Lie algebroids or more specifically Lie algebras, i.e. modules.  Another example is given by a p -form ω p together with E = M × ℝ[0] ⊕ ℝ[ p ] and the operator D = ∇ + ω p where ∇ is the flat connection on the trivial bundle M × ℝ.  Given a representation up to homotopy as D = ∂ + ∇ + ω 2 + … we can construct a new representation up to homotopy by conjugation, i.e.   D = ∂ − ∇ + ω 2 − ω 3 + −….   Adjoint representation  Given a Lie algebroid ( A , ρ ,[.,.]) together with a connection ∇ on its vector bundle we can define two associated A -connections as follows 3         ∇   ϕ    b  a  s    ψ   :=    [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]   +    ∇    ρ    (  ψ  )     ϕ     ,     assign    subscript   superscript  normal-∇    b  a  s    ϕ   ψ      ϕ  ψ     subscript  normal-∇    ρ  ψ    ϕ      \nabla^{bas}_{\!\phi\,}\psi:=[\phi,\psi]+\nabla_{\!\rho(\psi)\,}\phi,            ∇   ϕ    b  a  s    X   :=    [   ρ   (  ϕ  )    ,  X  ]   +   ρ   (    ∇   X    ϕ   )      .     assign    subscript   superscript  normal-∇    b  a  s    ϕ   X        ρ  ϕ   X     ρ    subscript  normal-∇  X   ϕ       \nabla^{bas}_{\!\phi\,}X:=[\rho(\phi),X]+\rho(\nabla_{\!X\,}\phi).   Moreover we can introduce the mixed curvature as         R   b  a  s     (  ϕ  ,  ψ  )    (  X  )    :=      ∇   X     [  ϕ  ,  ψ  ]    -   [    ∇   X    ϕ   ,  ψ  ]   -   [  ϕ  ,    ∇   X    ψ   ]   -    ∇    ∇   ψ    b  a  s     X     ϕ    +    ∇    ∇   ψ    b  a  s     X     ϕ     .     assign     superscript  R    b  a  s     ϕ  ψ   X         subscript  normal-∇  X   ϕ  ψ      subscript  normal-∇  X   ϕ   ψ    ϕ    subscript  normal-∇  X   ψ      subscript  normal-∇    subscript   superscript  normal-∇    b  a  s    ψ   X    ϕ      subscript  normal-∇    subscript   superscript  normal-∇    b  a  s    ψ   X    ϕ      R^{bas}(\phi,\psi)(X):=\nabla_{\!X\,}[\phi,\psi]-[\nabla_{\!X\,}\phi,\psi]-[%
 \phi,\nabla_{\!X\,}\psi]-\nabla_{\!\nabla^{bas}_{\!\psi\,}X\,}\phi+\nabla_{\!%
 \nabla^{bas}_{\!\psi\,}X\,}\phi.   This curvature measures the compatibility of the Lie bracket with the connection and is one of the two conditions of A together with TM forming a matched pair of Lie algebroids.  The first observation is that this term decorated with the anchor map ρ , accordingly, expresses the curvature of both connections ∇ bas . Secondly we can match up all three ingredients to a representation up to homotopy as:       D  =   ρ  +   ∇   b  a  s    +   R   b  a  s      .      D    ρ   superscript  normal-∇    b  a  s     superscript  R    b  a  s       D=\rho+\nabla^{bas}+R^{bas}.     Another observation is that the resulting representation up to homotopy is independent of the chosen connection ∇, basically because the difference between two A -connections is an ( A − 1 -form with values in End( E ).
