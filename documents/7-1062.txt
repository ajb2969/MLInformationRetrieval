Free entropy

A thermodynamic free entropy is an entropic thermodynamic potential analogous to the free energy. Also known as a Massieu, Planck, or Massieu–Planck potentials (or functions), or (rarely) free information. In statistical mechanics, free entropies frequently appear as the logarithm of a partition function. The Onsager reciprocal relations in particular, are developed in terms of entropic potentials. In mathematics, free entropy means something quite different: it is a generalization of entropy defined in the subject of free probability.
A free entropy is generated by a Legendre transform of the entropy. The different potentials correspond to different constraints to which the system may be subjected.

Note that the use of the terms "Massieu" and "Planck" for explicit Massieu-Planck potentials are somewhat obscure and ambiguous. In particular "Planck potential" has alternative meanings. The most standard notation for an entropic potential is 
 
 
 
 , used by both Planck and Schrödinger. (Note that Gibbs used 
 
 
 
 
  to denote the free energy.) Free entropies where invented by French engineer Francois Massieu in 1869, and actually predate Gibbs's free energy (1875).
