Transition rate matrix

In probability theory, a transition rate matrix (also known as an intensity matrix12 or infinitesimal generator matrix3) is an array of numbers describing the rate a continuous time Markov chain moves between states.
In a transition rate matrix Q (sometimes written A4) element qij (for i ≠ j) denotes the rate departing from i and arriving in state j. Diagonal elements qii are defined such that


 
  and therefore the rows of the matrix sum to zero.
Definition
A Q matrix (qij) satisfies the following conditions5

0 ≤ -qii < ∞
0 ≤ qij for all i ≠ j


 
  for all i.

Example
An M/M/1 queue, a model which counts the number of jobs in a queueing system with arrivals at rate λ and services at rate μ, has transition rate matrix
