   Midy's theorem      Midy's theorem   In mathematics , Midy's theorem , named after French  mathematician E. Midy, 1 2 is a statement about the decimal expansion of fractions  a / p where p is a prime and a / p has a repeating decimal expansion with an even period . If the period of the decimal representation of a / p is 2 n , so that       a  p   =   0.     a  1    a  2    a  3   …   a  n    a   n  +  1    …   a   2  n     ¯          a  p     0.   normal-¯     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3   normal-…   subscript  a  n    subscript  a    n  1    normal-…   subscript  a    2  n         \frac{a}{p}=0.\overline{a_{1}a_{2}a_{3}\dots a_{n}a_{n+1}\dots a_{2n}}     then the digits in the second half of the repeating decimal period are the 9s complement of the corresponding digits in its first half.

 99.\,     Extended Midy's theorem  If k is any divisor of the period of the decimal expansion of a / p (where p is again a prime), then Midy's theorem can be generalised as follows. The extended Midy's theorem 3 states that if the repeating portion of the decimal expansion of a / p is divided into k -digit numbers, then their sum is a multiple of 10 k − 1.  For example,       1  19   =   0.    052631578947368421  ¯           1  19     0.   normal-¯  052631578947368421      \frac{1}{19}=0.\overline{052631578947368421}\,   has a period of 18. Dividing the repeating portion into 6-digit numbers and summing them gives       052631  +  578947  +  368421   =  999999.        052631  578947  368421   999999.    052631+578947+368421=999999.   Similarly, dividing the repeating portion into 3-digit numbers and summing them gives       052  +  631  +  578  +  947  +  368  +  421   =  2997  =   3  ×  999.           052  631  578  947  368  421   2997         3  999.      052+631+578+947+368+421=2997=3\times 999.     Midy's theorem in other bases  Midy's theorem and its extension do not depend on special properties of the decimal expansion, but work equally well in any base  b , provided we replace 10 k − 1 with b k − 1 and carry out addition in base b .  For example, in octal        1  19    =   0.    032745  ¯   8          1  19     0.   subscript   normal-¯  032745   8      \displaystyle\frac{1}{19}=0.\overline{032745}_{8}     In duodecimal (using inverted two and three for ten and eleven, respectively)        1  19    =   0.     076  ℰ  45   ¯   12          1  19     0.   subscript   normal-¯    076  ℰ  45    12      \displaystyle\frac{1}{19}=0.\overline{076\mathcal{E}45}_{12}     Proof of Midy's theorem  Short proofs of Midy's theorem can be given using results from group theory . However, it is also possible to prove Midy's theorem using elementary algebra and modular arithmetic :  Let p be a prime and a / p be a fraction between 0 and 1. Suppose the expansion of a / p in base b has a period of ℓ , so        a  p    =    [   0.     a  1    a  2   …   a  ℓ    ¯    ]   b         a  p    subscript   delimited-[]    0.   normal-¯     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  normal-ℓ       b     \displaystyle\frac{a}{p}=[0.\overline{a_{1}a_{2}\dots a_{\ell}}]_{b}     where N is the integer whose expansion in base b is the string a 1 a 2 ... a ℓ .  Note that b  ℓ − 1 is a multiple of p because ( b  ℓ − 1) a / p is an integer. Also b n −1 is not a multiple of p for any value of n less than ℓ , because otherwise the repeating period of a / p in base b would be less than ℓ .  Now suppose that ℓ = hk . Then b  ℓ − 1 is a multiple of b k − 1. (To see this, substitute x for b k ; then b ℓ = x h and x − 1 is a factor of x h − 1. ) Say b  ℓ − 1 = m ( b k − 1), so        a  p   =   N   m   (    b  k   -  1   )      .        a  p     N    m     superscript  b  k   1       \frac{a}{p}=\frac{N}{m(b^{k}-1)}.     But b  ℓ − 1 is a multiple of p ; b k − 1 is not a multiple of p (because k is less than ℓ ); and p is a prime; so m must be a multiple of p and        a  m   p   =   N    b  k   -  1            a  m   p     N     superscript  b  k   1      \frac{am}{p}=\frac{N}{b^{k}-1}     is an integer. In other words       N  ≡   0     (   mod    b  k   -  1    )     .      N   annotated  0   pmod     superscript  b  k   1       N\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}b^{k}-1).\,     Now split the string a 1 a 2 ... a ℓ into h equal parts of length k , and let these represent the integers N 0 ... N h − 1 in base b , so that      N   h  -  1      subscript  N    h  1     \displaystyle N_{h-1}     To prove Midy's extended theorem in base b we must show that the sum of the h integers N i is a multiple of b k − 1.  Since b k is congruent to 1 modulo b k − 1, any power of b k will also be congruent to 1 modulo b k − 1. So      N  =    ∑   i  =  0    h  -  1      N  i    b   i  k      =    ∑   i  =  0    h  -  1      N  i     (   b  k   )   i           N    superscript   subscript     i  0      h  1       subscript  N  i    superscript  b    i  k             superscript   subscript     i  0      h  1       subscript  N  i    superscript   superscript  b  k   i        N=\sum_{i=0}^{h-1}N_{i}b^{ik}=\sum_{i=0}^{h-1}N_{i}(b^{k})^{i}          ⇒  N  ≡     ∑   i  =  0    h  -  1     N  i       (   mod    b  k   -  1    )         normal-⇒  absent  N        annotated    superscript   subscript     i  0      h  1     subscript  N  i     pmod     superscript  b  k   1        \Rightarrow N\equiv\sum_{i=0}^{h-1}N_{i}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}b^{k}-1)          ⇒    ∑   i  =  0    h  -  1     N  i    ≡   0     (   mod    b  k   -  1    )         normal-⇒  absent    superscript   subscript     i  0      h  1     subscript  N  i          annotated  0   pmod     superscript  b  k   1        \Rightarrow\sum_{i=0}^{h-1}N_{i}\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}b^{k}-1)     which proves Midy's extended theorem in base b .  To prove the original Midy's theorem, take the special case where h = 2. Note that N 0 and N 1 are both represented by strings of k digits in base b so both satisfy      0  ≤   N  i   ≤    b  k   -   1.          0   subscript  N  i           superscript  b  k   1.      0\leq N_{i}\leq b^{k}-1.\,     N 0 and N 1 cannot both equal 0 (otherwise a / p = 0) and cannot both equal b k − 1 (otherwise a / p = 1), so      0  <    N  0   +   N  1    <   2   (    b  k   -  1   )          0     subscript  N  0    subscript  N  1           2     superscript  b  k   1       0     and since N 0 + N 1 is a multiple of b k − 1, it follows that        N  0   +   N  1    =    b  k   -   1.           subscript  N  0    subscript  N  1       superscript  b  k   1.     N_{0}+N_{1}=b^{k}-1.\,     Corollary  From the above,       a  m   p        a  m   p    \frac{am}{p}   is an integer  Thus    m  =   0     (   mod  p   )        m   annotated  0   pmod  p      m=0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     And thus for    k  =   l  2       k    l  2     k=\frac{l}{2}           b   l  2    +  1   =   0     (   mod  p   )           superscript  b    l  2    1    annotated  0   pmod  p      b^{\frac{l}{2}}+1=0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     For    k  =   l  3       k    l  3     k=\frac{l}{3}   and is an integer        b    2  3   l    +   b   l  3    +  1   =   0     (   mod  p   )           superscript  b      2  3   l     superscript  b    l  3    1    annotated  0   pmod  p      b^{\frac{2}{3}l}+b^{\frac{l}{3}}+1=0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     and so on.
