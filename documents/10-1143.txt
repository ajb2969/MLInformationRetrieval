   Taxane 13alpha-hydroxylase      Taxane 13alpha-hydroxylase   In enzymology , a taxane 13alpha-hydroxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-ol + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha,13alpha-diol + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-ol , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha,13alpha-diol , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is taxa-4(20),11-dien-5alpha-ol,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (13alpha-hydroxylating) . This enzyme participates in diterpenoid biosynthesis .
