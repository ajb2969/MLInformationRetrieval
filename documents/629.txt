   Eisenstein prime      Eisenstein prime   In mathematics , an Eisenstein prime is an Eisenstein integer      z  =  a  +   b   ω   (  ω  =   e    2  π  i   /  3    )      fragments  z   a   b  ω  italic-   fragments  normal-(  ω    superscript  e      2  π  i   3    normal-)     z=a+b\,\omega\qquad(\omega=e^{2\pi i/3})     that is irreducible (or equivalently prime ) in the ring-theoretic sense: its only Eisenstein divisors are the units (±1, ±ω, ±ω 2 ), a + b ω itself and its associates.  The associates (unit multiples) and the complex conjugate of any Eisenstein prime are also prime.  Characterization  An Eisenstein integer z = a + b ω is an Eisenstein prime if and only if either of the following (mutually exclusive) conditions hold:   z is equal to the product of a unit and a natural prime of the form 3 n − 1,  | z | 2 = a 2 − ab + b 2 is a natural prime (necessarily congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3).   It follows that the absolute value squared of every Eisenstein prime is a natural prime or the square of a natural prime.  Examples  The first few Eisenstein primes that equal a natural prime 3 n − 1 are:   2 , 5 , 11 , 17 , 23 , 29 , 41 , 47 , 53 , 59 , 71 , 83 , 89 , 101 , ... .   Natural primes that are congruent to 0 or 1 modulo 3 are not Eisenstein primes: they admit nontrivial factorizations in Z [ω]. For example:   3 = −(1 + 2ω) 2   7 = (3 + ω)(2 − ω).   Some non-real Eisenstein primes are   2 + ω, 3 + ω, 4 + ω, 5 + 2ω, 6 + ω, 7 + ω, 7 + 3ω.   Up to conjugacy and unit multiples, the primes listed above, together with 2 and 5, are all the Eisenstein primes of absolute value not exceeding 7.  Large primes  , the largest known (real) Eisenstein prime is 19249 × 2 13018586 + 1, which is the eleventh largest known prime , discovered by Konstantin Agafonov. 1 All larger known primes are Mersenne primes , discovered by GIMPS . Real Eisenstein primes are congruent to 2 mod 3, and Mersenne primes (except the smallest, 3) are congruent to 1 mod 3; thus no Mersenne prime is an Eisenstein prime.
