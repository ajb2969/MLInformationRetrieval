Prune and search

Prune and search is a method of solving optimization problems suggested by Nimrod Megiddo in 1983. 1
The basic idea of the method is a recursive procedure in which at each step the input size is reduced ("pruned") by a constant factor 0 T(n) = S(n) + T(n(1-p)), \, 
which has the solution T(n) = O(S(n)), since summing a geometric series only multiplies by a constant factor, namely 
 
 

In particular, Megiddo himself used this approach in his linear time algorithm for the linear programming problem when the dimension is fixed2 and for the minimal enclosing sphere problem for a set of points in space.3
