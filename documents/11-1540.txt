   MRNA guanylyltransferase      MRNA guanylyltransferase   In enzymology , a mRNA guanylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GTP + (5')ppPur-mRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   diphosphate + G(5')pppPur-mRNA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GTP and (5')ppPur-mRNA , whereas its two products are diphosphate and G(5')pppPur-mRNA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , to be specific those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups ( nucleotidyltransferases ). The systematic name of this enzyme class is GTP:mRNA guanylyltransferase . Other names in common use include mRNA capping enzyme , messenger RNA guanylyltransferase , and Protein 2 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
