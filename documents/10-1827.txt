Choline sulfotransferase




Choline sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a choline sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + choline 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + choline sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and choline, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and choline sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:choline sulfotransferase. This enzyme is also called choline sulphokinase. This enzyme participates in sulfur metabolism.
