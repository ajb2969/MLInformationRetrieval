   Zakharov system      Zakharov system   In mathematics, the Zakharov system is a system of non-linear partial differential equations, introduced by Vladimir Zakharov in 1972 to describe the propagation of Langmuir waves in an ionized  plasma . The system consists of a complex field u and a real field n satisfying the equations        i    ∂  t   u    +    ∇  2   u    =   u  n           i    subscript   t   u      superscript  normal-∇  2   u      u  n     i\partial_{t}u+\nabla^{2}u=un          □  n   =   -    ∇  2    (    |  u  |   2   )           normal-□  n       superscript  normal-∇  2    superscript    u   2       \Box n=-\nabla^{2}(|u|^{2})     References    .
