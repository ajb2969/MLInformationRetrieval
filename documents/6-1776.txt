}} In physics, the ARGUS distribution, named after the particle physics experiment ARGUS,1 is the probability distribution of the reconstructed invariant mass of a decayed particle candidate in continuum background.
Definition
The probability density function of the ARGUS distribution is:


 
  for . Here χ, and c are parameters of the distribution and


 
  and Φ(·), ϕ(·) are the cumulative distribution and probability density functions of the standard normal distribution, respectively.
Differential equation



Cumulative distribution function
The cdf of the ARGUS distribution is



Parameter estimation
Parameter c is assumed to be known (the speed of light), whereas χ can be estimated from the sample X1, …, Xn using the maximum likelihood approach. The estimator is a function of sample second moment, and is given as a solution to the non-linear equation



The solution exists and is unique, provided that the right-hand side is greater than 0.4; the resulting estimator 
 
 
 
  is consistent and asymptotically normal.
Generalized ARGUS distribution
Sometimes a more general form is used to describe a more peaking-like distribution:



where Γ(·) is the gamma function, and Γ(·,·) is the upper incomplete gamma function.
Here parameters c, χ, p represent the cutoff, curvature, and power respectively.
mode = 
 
 

p = 0.5 gives a regular ARGUS, listed above.

 (More formally by the ARGUS Collaboration, H. Albrecht et al.) In this paper, the function has been defined with parameter c representing the beam energy and parameter p set to 0.5. The normalization and the parameter χ have been obtained from data.↩
