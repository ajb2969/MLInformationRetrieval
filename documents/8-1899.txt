   Euclidean distance matrix      Euclidean distance matrix   In mathematics , a Euclidean distance matrix is an n×n  matrix representing the spacing of a set of n  points in Euclidean space . If A is a Euclidean distance matrix and the points     x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}   are defined on m -dimensional space, then the elements of A are given by        A    =      (   a   i  j    )   ;        a   i  j      =      ||    x  i   -   x  j    ||   2  2         A    subscript  a    i  j       subscript  a    i  j      superscript   subscript   norm     subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j     2   2      \begin{array}[]{rll}A&=&(a_{ij});\\
 a_{ij}&=&||x_{i}-x_{j}||_{2}^{2}\end{array}     where ||.|| 2 denotes the 2-norm on R m .  Properties  Simply put, the element    a   i  j      subscript  a    i  j     a_{ij}   describes the square of the distance between the i th and j th points in the set. By the properties of the 2-norm (or indeed, Euclidean distance in general), the matrix A has the following properties.   All elements on the diagonal of A are zero (i.e. it is a hollow matrix ).  The trace of A is zero (by the above property).  A is symmetric (i.e.     a   i  j    =   a   j  i         subscript  a    i  j     subscript  a    j  i      a_{ij}=a_{ji}   ).        a   i  j     ≤     a   i  k     +    a   k  j             subscript  a    i  j          subscript  a    i  k        subscript  a    k  j        \sqrt{a_{ij}}\leq\sqrt{a_{ik}}+\sqrt{a_{kj}}   (by the triangle inequality )       a   i  j    ≥  0       subscript  a    i  j    0    a_{ij}\geq 0     The number of unique (distinct) non-zero values within an n -by- n Euclidean distance matrix is bounded above by     n   (   n  -  1   )    /  2        n    n  1    2    n(n-1)/2   due to the matrix being symmetric and hollow.  In dimension m , a Euclidean distance matrix has rank less than or equal to m+2 . If the points     x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n     x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}   are in general position , the rank is exactly   See also   Adjacency matrix  Coplanarity  Distance geometry  Distance matrix  Euclidean random matrix  Classical multidimensional scaling , a visualization technique that approximates an arbitrary dissimilarity matrix by a Euclidean distance matrix   References     "  Category:Matrices
