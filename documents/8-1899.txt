Euclidean distance matrix

In mathematics, a Euclidean distance matrix is an n√ón matrix representing the spacing of a set of n points in Euclidean space. If A is a Euclidean distance matrix and the points 
 
 
 
  are defined on m-dimensional space, then the elements of A are given by



where ||.||2 denotes the 2-norm on Rm.
Properties
Simply put, the element 
 
 
 
  describes the square of the distance between the ith and jth points in the set. By the properties of the 2-norm (or indeed, Euclidean distance in general), the matrix A has the following properties.

All elements on the diagonal of A are zero (i.e. it is a hollow matrix).
The trace of A is zero (by the above property).
A is symmetric (i.e. 
 
 
 
 ).


 
  (by the triangle inequality)



The number of unique (distinct) non-zero values within an n-by-n Euclidean distance matrix is bounded above by 
 
 
 
  due to the matrix being symmetric and hollow.
In dimension m, a Euclidean distance matrix has rank less than or equal to m+2. If the points 
 
 
 
  are in  general position, the rank is exactly
