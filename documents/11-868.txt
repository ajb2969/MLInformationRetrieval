   Beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase I      Beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase I   In enzymology , a beta-ketoacyl-acyl-carrier-protein synthase I () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   an acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + malonyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + CO 2 + [acyl-carrier-protein]   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ] and malonyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ], whereas its 3 products are 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein ], CO 2 , and acyl carrier protein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:malonyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] C-acyltransferase (decarboxylating) . Other names in common use include beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase I , beta-ketoacyl synthetase , beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthetase , beta-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthetase , beta-ketoacyl-[acyl carrier protein] synthase , beta-ketoacylsynthase , condensing enzyme , 3-ketoacyl-acyl carrier protein synthase , fatty acid condensing enzyme , acyl-malonyl(acyl-carrier-protein)-condensing enzyme , acyl-malonyl acyl carrier protein-condensing enzyme , beta-ketoacyl acyl carrier protein synthase , 3-oxoacyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] synthase , 3-oxoacyl:ACP synthase I , KASI , KAS I , FabF1 , and FabB . This enzyme participates in fatty acid biosynthesis .
