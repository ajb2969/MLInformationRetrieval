Boolean algebra

Converse Nonimplication in a general Boolean algebra is defined as 
 
 
 
 .

Example of a 2-element Boolean algebra: the 2 elements {0,1} with 0 as zero and 1 as unity element, operators 
 
 
 
  as complement operator, 
 
 
 
  as join operator and 
 
 
 
  as meet operator, build the Boolean algebra of propositional logic.

[4] Example of a 4-element Boolean algebra: the 4 divisors {1,2,3,6} of 6 with 1 as zero and 6 as unity element, operators 
 
 
 
  (codivisor of 6) as complement operator, 
 
 
 
  (least common multiple) as join operator and 
 
 
 
  (greatest common divisor) as meet operator, build a Boolean algebra.

(x's greatest Divisor coprime with y)




Properties
Non-associative


 
  iff 
 
 
[5] (In a two-element Boolean algebra the latter condition is reduced to 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 ). Hence in a nontrivial Boolean algebra Converse Nonimplication is nonassociative.



Clearly, it is associative iff 
 
 
 
 .
Non-commutative



 
  iff 
 
 
[6]. Hence Converse Nonimplication is noncommutative.

Neutral and absorbing elements



 
  is a left neutral element (
 
 
 
 ) and a right absorbing element (
 
 
 
 ).


 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .
Implication 
 
 
 
  is the dual of Converse Nonimplication 
 
 
[7].



[6]




Converse Nonimplication is noncommutative





Step

































































































[7]




Implication is the dual of Converse Nonimplication





Step




























































Computer science
An example for converse nonimplication in computer science can be found when performing a right outer join on a set of tables from a database, if records not matching the join-condition from the "left" table are being excluded.3
