   Ferromagnetic material properties      Ferromagnetic material properties   The article Ferromagnetic material properties is intended to contain a glossary of terms used to describe (mainly quantitatively) ferromagnetic materials, and magnetic cores .  Terms   hysteresis loop - induction B as function of field strength H for H varying between H min and H max ; for ferromagnetic material the B has different values for H going up and down, therefore a plot of the function forms a loop instead of a curve joining two points; for perminvar type materials, the loop is a "rectangle" ( Domain Structure of Perminvar Having a Rectangular Hysteresis Loop , Williams, Goertz, J. of Applied Physics  23 , 316 (1952); in fact it is rectangle if B-µ 0 H is used instead B on the plot);  remanence B r - "induction which remains" - after magnetization to saturation, a value of induction B in the material in a closed magnetic circuit without external field H; the point where hysteresis loop crosses B axis; 1  coercivity H c - after magnetization to saturation, a value of field strength H at which induction B in the material becomes 0; the point where hysteresis loop crosses H axis;  (maximum) energy product (BH) max - largest possible field of a rectangle on the hysteresis loop plot, which has two edges on the B and H axes, and a vertex on the hysteresis loop in the second quadrant (B positive, H negative); range from below 1J/m 3 for some soft materials (permalloy, 3E4 ferrite), to above 400kJ/m 3 for hard ones ( neodymium magnets );  magnetic viscosity - when an external field H is changed, and then kept at a new value, the induction B first changes almost at once, then some smaller change of B follows in a time; for a permanent magnet typically the time dependence is B(t)=B(t 0 )-S*ln(t/t 0 ), where t is time since H change, t0 is some reference time, and S is a constant of the process (but not of the material, as it varies with magnitude of the H and its change); a theory describing this kind of time dependency was developed by Louis Néel ( J. de Phys. et Radium , 11 , 49 (1950)) and by Street and Wooley (A Study of Magnetic Viscosity, Proc. Phys. Soc.  A62 . 562 (1949)).   Formulae  To describe a soft ferromagnetic material for technical use, the following parameters are specified:   (relative) permeability - ratio of induction B in the material caused by some field H to an induction in a vacuum in the same field; it is a dimensionless value, as it is relative to a vacuum permeability;  initial permeability is the ratio for small magnetization of initially demagnetized material     μ  i   =   B    μ  0   *  H         subscript  μ  i     B     subscript  μ  0   H      \mu_{i}=\frac{B}{\mu_{0}*H}   for very small H;  incremental permeability is the ratio of change of induction in the material to a change of induction in a vacuum due to the same field change, when the change is superimposed to some constant field     μ  Δ   =    Δ  B      μ  0   *  Δ   H         subscript  μ  normal-Δ       normal-Δ  B        subscript  μ  0   normal-Δ   H      \mu_{\Delta}=\frac{\Delta B}{\mu_{0}*\Delta H}   ;  amplitude permeability is the ratio of induction in the material to an induction in a vacuum for larger magnetization: just     μ  a   =   B    μ  0   *  H         subscript  μ  a     B     subscript  μ  0   H      \mu_{a}=\frac{B}{\mu_{0}*H}   ;  maximum incremental/amplitude permeability is the maximal value of the incremental/amplitude permeability on the hysteresis curve;     saturation induction - induction B for large (enough for    μ  Δ     subscript  μ  normal-Δ    \mu_{\Delta}   to become small), but reasonable H;    resistivity    ρ   ρ   \rho   - specific resistance, as for usual resistive materials, important because of eddy currents; unit =    Ω  *  m      normal-Ω  m    \Omega*m   ;    mass density - mass per unit volume, as for usual materials;    temperature factor of the permeability is defined as     α  F   =     μ  θ   -   μ   r  e  f       μ   r  e  f   2   *   (   θ  -   θ   r  e  f     )          subscript  α  F        subscript  μ  θ    subscript  μ    r  e  f        superscript   subscript  μ    r  e  f    2     θ   subscript  θ    r  e  f         \alpha_{F}=\frac{\mu_{\theta}-\mu_{ref}}{\mu_{ref}^{2}*(\theta-\theta_{ref})}   by IEC133, and as     α  F   =     μ  θ   -   μ   r  e  f       μ  θ   *   μ   r  e  f    *   (   θ  -   θ   r  e  f     )          subscript  α  F        subscript  μ  θ    subscript  μ    r  e  f        subscript  μ  θ    subscript  μ    r  e  f      θ   subscript  θ    r  e  f         \alpha_{F}=\frac{\mu_{\theta}-\mu_{ref}}{\mu_{\theta}*\mu_{ref}*(\theta-\theta%
