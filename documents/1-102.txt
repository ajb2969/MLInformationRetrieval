   Borsuk–Ulam theorem      Borsuk–Ulam theorem   In mathematics , the Borsuk–Ulam theorem (BUT), states that every continuous function from an n -sphere into Euclidean n -space maps some pair of antipodal points to the same point. Here, two points on a sphere are called antipodal if they are in exactly opposite directions from the sphere's center.  Formally: if    f  :    S  n   →   R  n       normal-:  f   normal-→   superscript  S  n    superscript  R  n      f:S^{n}\to R^{n}   is continuous then there exists an    x  ∈   S  n       x   superscript  S  n     x\in S^{n}   such that     f   (   -  x   )    =   f   (  x  )          f    x      f  x     f(-x)=f(x)   .  The case    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   can be illustrated by saying that there always exist a pair of opposite points on the earth's equator with the same temperature. The same is true for any circle. This assumes the temperature varies continuously.  The case    n  =  2      n  2    n=2   is often illustrated by saying that at any moment, there is always a pair of antipodal points on the Earth 's surface with equal temperatures and equal barometric pressures.  BUT has several equivalent statements in terms of odd functions . Recall that    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   is the n -sphere and    B  n     superscript  B  n    B^{n}   is the n -ball :   If    g  :    S  n   →   R  n       normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  S  n    superscript  R  n      g:S^{n}\to R^{n}   is a continuous odd function, then there exists an    x  ∈   S  n       x   superscript  S  n     x\in S^{n}   such that     g   (  x  )    =  0        g  x   0    g(x)=0   .  If    g  :    B  n   →   R  n       normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  B  n    superscript  R  n      g:B^{n}\to R^{n}   is a continuous function which is odd on    S   n  -  1      superscript  S    n  1     S^{n-1}   (the boundary of    B  n     superscript  B  n    B^{n}   ), then there exists an    x  ∈   B  n       x   superscript  B  n     x\in B^{n}   such that     g   (  x  )    =  0        g  x   0    g(x)=0   .   History  According to , the first historical mention of the statement of BUT appears in . The first proof was given by , where the formulation of the problem was attributed to Stanislaw Ulam . Since then, many alternative proofs have been found by various authors, as collected by .  Equivalent statements  The following statements are equivalent to BUT. 1  With odd functions  A function   g   g   g   is called odd (aka antipodal or antipode-preserving ) if for every   x   x   x        g   (   -  x   )    =   -   g   (  x  )           g    x        g  x      g(-x)=-g(x)   .  BUT is equivalent to the following statement: A continuous odd function from an n -sphere into Euclidean n -space has a zero. PROOF:   If BUT is correct, then it is specifically correct for odd functions, and for an odd function,     g   (   -  x   )    =   g   (  x  )          g    x      g  x     g(-x)=g(x)   iff     g   (  x  )    =  0        g  x   0    g(x)=0   . Hence every odd continuous function has a zero.  For every continuous function   f   f   f   , the following function is continuous and odd     g   (  x  )    =    f   (  x  )    -   f   (   -  x   )           g  x       f  x     f    x       g(x)=f(x)-f(-x)   . If every odd continuous function has a zero, then   g   g   g   has a zero, and there,     f   (  x  )    =   f   (   -  x   )          f  x     f    x      f(x)=f(-x)   . Hence BUT is correct.   With retractions  Define a retraction as a function    h  :    S  n   →   S   n  -  1        normal-:  h   normal-→   superscript  S  n    superscript  S    n  1       h:S^{n}\to S^{n-1}   .  BUT is equivalent to the following claim: there is no continuous odd retraction.  PROOF: If BUT is correct, then every continuous odd function from    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   must include 0 in its range. However,    0  ∉   S   n  -  1        0   superscript  S    n  1      0\notin S^{n-1}   so there cannot be a continuous odd function whose range is    S   n  -  1      superscript  S    n  1     S^{n-1}   .  Conversely, if BUT is incorrect, then there is a continuous odd function    g  :    S  n   →   R  n       normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  S  n    superscript  R  n      g:S^{n}\to R^{n}   with no zeroes. Then we can construct another odd function    h  :    S  n   →   S   n  -  1        normal-:  h   normal-→   superscript  S  n    superscript  S    n  1       h:S^{n}\to S^{n-1}   by:       h   (  x  )    =    g   (  x  )     |   g   (  x  )    |          h  x       g  x       g  x       h(x)=\frac{g(x)}{|g(x)|}     since   g   g   g   has no zeroes,   h   h   h   is well-defined and continuous. Thus we have a continuous odd retraction.  Proofs  1-dimensional case  The 1-dimensional case can easily be proved using the intermediate value theorem (IVT).  Let   g   g   g   be an odd real-valued function on a circle. Pick an arbitrary   x   x   x   . If     g   (  x  )    =  0        g  x   0    g(x)=0   then we are done. Otherwise, w.l.o.g.     g   (  x  )    >  0        g  x   0    g(x)>0   . But     g   (   -  x   )    <  0        g    x    0    g(-x)<0   . Hence, by the IVT there is a point   y   y   y   between   x   x   x   and    -  x      x    -x   on which     g   (  y  )    =  0        g  y   0    g(y)=0   .  General case - algebraic topology proof  BUT can be proved by the stronger statement that every odd function     h  *   :    S   n  -  1    →   S   n  -  1        normal-:   superscript  h     normal-→   superscript  S    n  1     superscript  S    n  1       h^{*}:S^{n-1}\to S^{n-1}   has odd degree .  Assume by contradiction that there exists a continuous odd retraction    h  :    S  n   →   S   n  -  1        normal-:  h   normal-→   superscript  S  n    superscript  S    n  1       h:S^{n}\to S^{n-1}   .  Let     h  *   :    S   n  -  1    →   S   n  -  1        normal-:   superscript  h     normal-→   superscript  S    n  1     superscript  S    n  1       h^{*}:S^{n-1}\to S^{n-1}   be the restriction of   h   h   h   to the equator.    h  *     superscript  h     h^{*}   is also odd and thus has non-zero degree.  By construction,    h  *     superscript  h     h^{*}   extends to the whole upper hemisphere of    S  n     superscript  S  n    S^{n}   , and as such is null-homotopic . A null-homotopic map has degree zero, contradicting our only assumption, namely that   h   h   h   exists.  General case - combinatorial proof  BUT can be proved from Tucker's lemma . 2  3 4  Let    g  :    S  n   →   R  n       normal-:  g   normal-→   superscript  S  n    superscript  R  n      g:S^{n}\to R^{n}   be a continuous odd function. Because g is continuous on a compact domain, it is uniformly continuous . Therefore, for every    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   , there is a    δ  >  0      δ  0    \delta>0   such that, for every two points of    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   which are within   δ   δ   \delta   of each other, their images under g are within   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   of each other.  Define a triangulation of    S  n     subscript  S  n    S_{n}   with edges of length at most   δ   δ   \delta   . Label each vertex   v   v   v   of the triangulation with a label     l   (  v  )    ∈    ±  1   ,   ±  2   ,  …  ,   ±  n          l  v     plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  2   normal-…   plus-or-minus  n      l(v)\in{\pm 1,\pm 2,...,\pm n}   in the following way:   The absolute value of the label is the index of the coordinate with the highest absolute value of g      |   l   (  v  )    |   =   arg    max  k    (   g    (  v  )   k    )             l  v        subscript   k     g   subscript  v  k        |l(v)|=\arg\max_{k}(g(v)_{k})   .  The sign of the label is the sign of g , so that     l   (  v  )    =    sgn   (   g   (  v  )    )     |   l   (  v  )    |          l  v      sgn    g  v        l  v       l(v)=\operatorname{sgn}(g(v))|l(v)|   .   Because g is odd, the labeling is also odd     l   (   -  v   )    =   -   l   (  v  )           l    v        l  v      l(-v)=-l(v)   . Hence, by Tucker's lemma, there are two adjacent vertices    u  ,  v     u  v    u,v   with opposite labels. Assume w.l.o.g. that the labels are      l   (  u  )    =  1   ,    l   (  v  )    =   -  1       formulae-sequence      l  u   1       l  v     1      l(u)=1,l(v)=-1   . By definition of l , this means that in both    g   (  u  )       g  u    g(u)   and    g   (  v  )       g  v    g(v)   , coordinate #1 is the largest coordinate; in    g   (  u  )       g  u    g(u)   this coordinate is positive while in    g   (  v  )       g  v    g(v)   it is negative. By the construction of the triangulation, the distance between    g   (  u  )       g  u    g(u)   and    g   (  v  )       g  v    g(v)   is at most   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   ; this means that both    |   g   (  u  )    |        g  u     |g(u)|   and    |   g   (  v  )    |        g  v     |g(v)|   are bounded by   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   .  The above is true for every   ϵ   ϵ   \epsilon   ; hence there must be a point u in which     |   g   (  u  )    |   =  0          g  u    0    |g(u)|=0   .  Corollaries   No subset of R n is homeomorphic to S n .  The Ham sandwich theorem : For any compact sets A 1 , ..., A n in R n we can always find a hyperplane dividing each of them into two subsets of equal measure.   Equivalent results  Above we showed how to prove BUT from Tucker's lemma. The converse is also true: it is possible to prove Tucker's lemma from BUT. Therefore, these two theorems are equivalent.  Generalizations  1. In the original BUT, the domain of the function f is the unit n -sphere (the boundary of the unit n -ball). In general, it is true also when the domain of f is the boundary of any open bounded symmetric subset of R n containing the origin (Here, symmetric means that if x is in the subset then - x is also in the subset). 5  2. Consider the function A which maps a point to its antipodal point: A(x)=-x . Note that A(A(x))=x . The original BUT claims that there is a point x in which f(A(x))=f(x) . In general, this is true also for every function A for which A(A(x))=x . 6 However, in general this is not true for other functions A . 7  See also   Topological combinatorics  Necklace splitting problem  Kakutani's theorem (geometry)  Isovariant   Notes  References         "  Category:Algebraic topology  Category:Combinatorics  Category:Continuous mappings  Category:Theorems in topology     ↩  ↩   ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
