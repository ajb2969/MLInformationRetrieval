Acetylenecarboxylate hydratase

In enzymology, an acetylenecarboxylate hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3-oxopropanoate 
 
 
 
  propynoate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3-oxopropanoate, and two products, propynoate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3-oxopropanoate hydro-lyase (propynoate-forming). Other names in common use include acetylenemonocarboxylate hydratase, alkynoate hydratase, acetylenemonocarboxylate hydrase, acetylenemonocarboxylic acid hydrase, malonate-semialdehyde dehydratase, and 3-oxopropanoate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: beta-alanine metabolism, propanoate metabolism, and butanoate metabolism.
