   Hadwiger–Finsler inequality      Hadwiger–Finsler inequality   In mathematics , the Hadwiger–Finsler inequality is a result on the geometry of triangles in the Euclidean plane , named after the mathematicians  Hugo Hadwiger and Paul Finsler . It states that if a triangle in the plane has side lengths a , b and c and area T , then         a  2   +   b  2   +   c  2    ≥      (   a  -  b   )   2   +    (   b  -  c   )   2   +    (   c  -  a   )   2   +   4   3   T    (HF)    .         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2        superscript    a  b   2    superscript    b  c   2    superscript    c  a   2     4    3   T    (HF)     a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\geq(a-b)^{2}+(b-c)^{2}+(c-a)^{2}+4\sqrt{3}T\quad\mbox{(HF)}.     Weitzenböck's inequality is a straightforward corollary of the Hadwiger–Finsler inequality: if a triangle in the plane has side lengths a , b and c and area T , then         a  2   +   b  2   +   c  2    ≥    4   3   T   (W)    .         superscript  a  2    superscript  b  2    superscript  c  2       4    3   T   (W)     a^{2}+b^{2}+c^{2}\geq 4\sqrt{3}T\quad\mbox{(W)}.     Weitzenböck's inequality can also be proved using Heron's formula , by which route it can be seen that equality holds in (W) if and only if the triangle is an equilateral triangle , i.e. a = b = c .
