   Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem      Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem   In mathematics, Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem is one of several ergodic theorems . It can be seen as a generalization of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem . 1 Intuitively, the subadditive ergodic theorem is a kind of random variable version of Fekete's lemma (hence the name ergodic). 2 As a result, it can be rephrased in the language of probability, e.g. using a sequence of random variables and expected values . The theorem is named after John Kingman .  Statement of theorem  Let   T   T   T   be a measure-preserving transformation on the probability space     (  Ω  ,  Σ  ,  μ  )     normal-Ω  normal-Σ  μ    (\Omega,\Sigma,\mu)   , and let     {   g  n   }    n  ∈  ℕ      subscript    subscript  g  n      n  ℕ     \{g_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   be a sequence of    L  1     superscript  L  1    L^{1}   functions such that      g   n  +  m     (  x  )    ≤     g  n    (  x  )    +    g  m    (    T  n   x   )            subscript  g    n  m    x        subscript  g  n   x      subscript  g  m      superscript  T  n   x       g_{n+m}(x)\leq g_{n}(x)+g_{m}(T^{n}x)   (subadditivity relation). Then        lim   n  →  ∞       g  n    (  x  )    n    =   g   (  x  )    ≥   -  ∞           subscript    normal-→  n          subscript  g  n   x   n      g  x               \lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{g_{n}(x)}{n}=g(x)\geq-\infty     for   μ   μ   \mu   -a.e. x , where g ( x ) is T -invariant. If T is ergodic , then g ( x ) is a constant.  Applications  If we take      g  n    (  x  )    :=    ∑   j  =  0    n  -  1     f   (    T  n   x   )        assign     subscript  g  n   x     superscript   subscript     j  0      n  1      f     superscript  T  n   x       g_{n}(x):=\sum_{j=0}^{n-1}f(T^{n}x)   , then we have additivity and we get Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem.  Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem can be used to prove statements about Lyapunov exponents . It also has applications to percolations and probability/ random variables . 3  References  External links   Theorem proof (Steele)   "  Category:Ergodic theory     S.
