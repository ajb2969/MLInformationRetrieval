Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem

In mathematics, Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem is one of several ergodic theorems. It can be seen as a generalization of Birkhoff's ergodic theorem.1 Intuitively, the subadditive ergodic theorem is a kind of random variable version of Fekete's lemma (hence the name ergodic).2 As a result, it can be rephrased in the language of probability, e.g. using a sequence of random variables and expected values. The theorem is named after John Kingman.
Statement of theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a measure-preserving transformation on the probability space

 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be a sequence of 
 
 
 
  functions such that 
 
 
 
  (subadditivity relation). Then



for 
 
 
 
 -a.e. x, where g(x) is T-invariant. If T is ergodic, then g(x) is a constant.
Applications
If we take 
 
 
 
 , then we have additivity and we get Birkhoff's pointwise ergodic theorem.
Kingman's subadditive ergodic theorem can be used to prove statements about Lyapunov exponents. It also has applications to percolations and probability/random variables.3
