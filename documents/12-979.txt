   Web Services Modeling Language      Web Services Modeling Language   WSML or Web Service Modeling Language is a formal language that provides a syntax and semantics for the Web Service Modeling Ontology (WSMO) .  In other words, the WSML provides means to formally describe the WSMO elements as Ontologies , Semantic Web services , Goals , and Mediators . 1  The WSML is based on the logical formalisms as Description Logic , First-order Logic and Logic Programming . 2  Language variants of WSML   WSML Core , defined as an intersection of the Description Logic and Horn Logic . Supports modeling classes, attributes, binary relations and instances.  WSML-DL , extension of the WSML Core, fully captures the Description Logic     ùíÆ  ‚Ñã  ‚Ñê   ùí¨   (  ùíü  )        ùíÆ  ‚Ñã  ‚Ñê   superscript  ùí¨  ùíü     \mathcal{SHIQ}^{\mathcal{(D)}}   .  WSML-Flight , extension of the WSML Core, provides features as meta-modeling, constraints and nonmonotonic negation.  WSML-Rule , extension of the WSML-Flight, provides Logic Programming capabilities.  WSML-Full , a unification of the WSML-DL and WSML-Rule.
