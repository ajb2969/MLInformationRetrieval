   Distribution (differential geometry)      Distribution (differential geometry)   In differential geometry , a discipline within mathematics , a distribution is a subset of the tangent bundle of a manifold satisfying certain properties. Distributions are used to build up notions of integrability , and specifically of a foliation of a manifold.  Even though they share the same name, distributions we discuss in this article have nothing to do with distributions in the sense of analysis.  Definition  Let   M   M   M   be a    C  ∞     superscript  C     C^{\infty}   manifold of dimension   m   m   m   , and let    n  ≤  m      n  m    n\leq m   . Suppose that for each    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   , we assign an   n   n   n   -dimensional subspace      Δ  x   ⊂    T  x    (  M  )         subscript  normal-Δ  x      subscript  T  x   M     \Delta_{x}\subset T_{x}(M)   of the tangent space in such a way that for a neighbourhood      N  x   ⊂  M       subscript  N  x   M    N_{x}\subset M   of   x   x   x   there exist   n   n   n    linearly independent smooth vector fields      X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n       subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n     X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}   such that for any point    y  ∈   N  x       y   subscript  N  x     y\in N_{x}   ,      X  1    (  y  )    ,  …  ,    X  n    (  y  )          subscript  X  1   y   normal-…     subscript  X  n   y     X_{1}(y),\ldots,X_{n}(y)    span      Δ  y   .     subscript  normal-Δ  y    \Delta_{y}.   We let   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   refer to the collection of all the    Δ  x     subscript  normal-Δ  x    \Delta_{x}   for all    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   and we then call   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   a distribution of dimension   n   n   n   on   M   M   M   , or sometimes a     C  ∞     superscript  C     C^{\infty}      n   n   n   -plane distribution on    M  .    M   M.   The set of smooth vector fields    {   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   }      subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n     \{X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\}   is called a local basis of    Δ  .    normal-Δ   \Delta.     Involutive distributions  We say that a distribution   Δ   normal-Δ   \Delta   on   M   M   M   is involutive if for every point    x  ∈  M      x  M    x\in M   there exists a local basis    {   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   }      subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n     \{X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\}   of the distribution in a neighbourhood of   x   x   x   such that for all     1  ≤  i   ,   j  ≤  n      formulae-sequence    1  i     j  n     1\leq i,j\leq n   ,    [   X  i   ,   X  j   ]      subscript  X  i    subscript  X  j     [X_{i},X_{j}]   (the Lie bracket of two vector fields) is in the span of     {   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   }   .      subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n     \{X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\}.   That is, if    [   X  i   ,   X  j   ]      subscript  X  i    subscript  X  j     [X_{i},X_{j}]   is a linear combination of     {   X  1   ,  …  ,   X  n   }   .      subscript  X  1   normal-…   subscript  X  n     \{X_{1},\ldots,X_{n}\}.   Normally this is written as      [  Δ  ,  Δ  ]   ⊂  Δ   .       normal-Δ  normal-Δ   normal-Δ    [\Delta,\Delta]\subset\Delta.     Involutive distributions are the tangent spaces to foliations . Involutive distributions are important in that they satisfy the conditions of the Frobenius theorem , and thus lead to integrable systems .  A related idea occurs in Hamiltonian mechanics : two functions f and g on a symplectic manifold are said to be in mutual involution if their Poisson bracket vanishes.  Generalized distributions  A generalized distribution , or Stefan-Sussmann distribution , is similar to a distribution, but the subspaces     Δ  x   ⊂    T  x   M        subscript  normal-Δ  x      subscript  T  x   M     \Delta_{x}\subset T_{x}M   are not required to all be of the same dimension. The definition requires that the    Δ  x     subscript  normal-Δ  x    \Delta_{x}   are determined locally by a set of vector fields, but these will no longer be linearly independent everywhere. It is not hard to see that the dimension of    Δ  x     subscript  normal-Δ  x    \Delta_{x}   is lower semicontinuous , so that at special points the dimension is lower than at nearby points.  One class of examples is furnished by a non-free action of a Lie group on a manifold, the vector fields in question being the infinitesimal generators of the group action (a free action gives rise to a genuine distribution). Another arises in dynamical systems , where the set of vector fields in the definition is the set of vector fields that commute with a given one. There are also examples and applications in Control theory , where the generalized distribution represents infinitesimal constraints of the system.  References   William M. Boothby. Section IV. 8.
