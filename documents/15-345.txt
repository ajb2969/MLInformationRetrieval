   Square class      Square class   In abstract algebra , a square class of a field (mathematics)    F   F   F   is an element of the square class group , the quotient group      F  ×   /   F    ×  2         superscript  F     superscript  F    absent  2      F^{\times}/F^{\times 2}   of the multiplicative group of nonzero elements in the field modulo the square elements of the field. Each square class is a subset of the nonzero elements (a coset of the multiplicative group) consisting of the elements of the form xy 2 where x is some particular fixed element and y ranges over all nonzero field elements. 1  For instance, if    F  =  ℝ      F  ℝ    F=\mathbb{R}   , the field of real numbers, then    F  ×     superscript  F     F^{\times}   is just the group of all nonzero real numbers (with the multiplication operation) and    F    ×  2      superscript  F    absent  2     F^{\times 2}   is the subgroup of positive numbers (as every positive number has a real square root ). The quotient of these two groups is a group with two elements, corresponding to two cosets : the set of positive numbers and the set of negative numbers. Thus, the real numbers have two square classes, the positive numbers and the negative numbers. 2  Square classes are frequently studied in relation to the theory of quadratic forms . 3 The reason is that if   V   V   V   is an   F   F   F   -vector space and    q  :   V  →  F      normal-:  q   normal-→  V  F     q:V\to F   is a quadratic form and   v   v   v   is an element of   V   V   V   such that     q   (  v  )    =  a  ∈   F  ×           q  v   a        superscript  F       q(v)=a\in F^{\times}   , then for all    u  ∈   F  ×       u   superscript  F      u\in F^{\times}   ,     q   (   u  v   )    =   a   u  2          q    u  v      a   superscript  u  2      q(uv)=au^{2}   and thus it is sometimes more convenient to talk about the square classes which the quadratic form represents.  Every element of the square class group is an involution . It follows that, if the number of square classes of a field is finite, it must be a power of two . 4  References  "  Category:Field theory     . ↩    . ↩
