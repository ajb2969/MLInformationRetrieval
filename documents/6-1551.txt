   Cairo pentagonal tiling      Cairo pentagonal tiling   In geometry , the Cairo pentagonal tiling is a dual semiregular tiling of the Euclidean plane . It is given its name because several streets in Cairo are paved in this design. 1 2 It is one of 14 known isohedral  pentagon tilings .  It is also called MacMahon's net 3 after Percy Alexander MacMahon and his 1921 publication New Mathematical Pastimes . 4  Conway calls it a 4-fold pentille . 5  These are not regular pentagons: their sides are not equal (they have four long ones and one short one in the ratio 1:sqrt(3)-1 6 ), and their angles in sequence are 120°, 120°, 90°, 120°, 90°.  As a 2-dimensinal crystal net, it shares a special feature with the honeycomb net. Both nets are examples of standard realization , the notion introduced by M. Kotani and T. Sunada for general crystal nets. 7 8  It is similar to the prismatic pentagonal tiling with face configuration V3.3.3.4.4.  Dual tiling  It is the dual of the snub square tiling , made of two squares and three equilateral triangles around each vertex. 9      Relation to hexagonal tilings  This tiling can be seen as the union of two perpendicular hexagonal tilings , flattened by a ratio of    3      3    \sqrt{3}   . Each hexagon is divided into four pentagons . The two hexagons can also be distorted to be concave, leading to concave pentagons. 10 Alternately one of the hexagonal tilings can remain regular, and the second one stretched and flattened by    3      3    \sqrt{3}   in each direction, intersecting into 2 forms of pentagons.

However it can be adjusted to other geometric forms with the same topological connectivity and different symmetry. For example, this rectangular tiling is topologically identical.
