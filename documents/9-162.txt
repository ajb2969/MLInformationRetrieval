   Landau–Kolmogorov inequality      Landau–Kolmogorov inequality   In mathematics , the Landau–Kolmogorov inequality , named after Edmund Landau and Andrey Kolmogorov , is the following family of interpolation inequalities between different derivatives of a function f defined on a subset T of the real numbers: 1         ∥   f   (  k  )    ∥     L  ∞    (  T  )     ≤   C   (  n  ,  k  ,  T  )     ∥  f  ∥     L  ∞    (  T  )       1  -   k  /  n       ∥   f   (  n  )    ∥     L  ∞    (  T  )       k  /  n    for  1   ≤  k  <  n   .         subscript   norm   superscript  f  k       subscript  L    T      C   n  k  T    superscript   subscript   norm  f      subscript  L    T      1    k  n      superscript   subscript   norm   superscript  f  n       subscript  L    T      k  n    for  1        k       n     \|f^{(k)}\|_{L_{\infty}(T)}\leq C(n,k,T){\|f\|_{L_{\infty}(T)}}^{1-k/n}{\|f^{(%
 n)}\|_{L_{\infty}(T)}}^{k/n}\text{ for }1\leq k     On the real line  For k = 1, n = 2, T = R the inequality was first proved by Edmund Landau 2 with the sharp constant C (2, 1, R ) = 2. Following contributions by Jacques Hadamard and Georgiy Shilov , Andrey Kolmogorov found the sharp constants and arbitrary n , k : 3        C   (  n  ,  k  ,  ℝ  )    =    a   n  -  k      a  n    -  1   +   k  /  n        ,        C   n  k  ℝ       subscript  a    n  k     superscript   subscript  a  n       1     k  n        C(n,k,\mathbb{R})=a_{n-k}a_{n}^{-1+k/n}~{},     where a n are the Favard constants .  On the half-line  Following work by Matorin and others, the extremising functions were found by Isaac Jacob Schoenberg , 4 explicit forms for the sharp constants are however still unknown.  Generalisations  There are many generalisations, which are of the form         ∥   f   (  k  )    ∥     L  q    (  T  )     ≤    K  ⋅    ∥  f  ∥     L  p    (  T  )    α   ⋅    ∥   f   (  n  )    ∥     L  r    (  T  )     1  -  α     for  1   ≤  k  <  n   .         subscript   norm   superscript  f  k       subscript  L  q   T       normal-⋅  K   subscript   superscript   norm  f   α      subscript  L  p   T     subscript   superscript   norm   superscript  f  n      1  α       subscript  L  r   T     for  1        k       n     \|f^{(k)}\|_{L_{q}(T)}\leq K\cdot{\|f\|^{\alpha}_{L_{p}(T)}}\cdot{\|f^{(n)}\|^%
 {1-\alpha}_{L_{r}(T)}}\text{ for }1\leq k     Here all three norms can be different from each other (from L 1 to L ∞ , with p = q = r =∞ in the classical case) and T may be the real axis, semiaxis or a closed segment.  The Kallman–Rota inequality generalizes the Landau–Kolmogorov inequalities from the derivative operator to more general contractions on Banach spaces . 5  Notes  "  Category:Inequalities     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  . ↩
