   Monad (non-standard analysis)      Monad (non-standard analysis)   In non-standard analysis , a monad (also called halo 1 ) is the set of points infinitesimally close to a given point.  Given a hyperreal number  x in R ∗ , the monad of x is the set        monad   (  x  )    =   {   y  ∈   ℝ  *    ∣   x  -   y  is infinitesimal    }    .        monad  x    conditional-set    y   superscript  ℝ       x    y  is infinitesimal       \text{monad}(x)=\{y\in\mathbb{R}^{*}\mid x-y\text{ is infinitesimal}\}.     If x is finite (limited), the unique real number in the monad of x is called the standard part of x .  See also   Infinitesimal   Notes  References   H.
