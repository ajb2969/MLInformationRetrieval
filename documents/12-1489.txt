Monad (non-standard analysis)

In non-standard analysis, a monad (also called halo1) is the set of points infinitesimally close to a given point.
Given a hyperreal number x in Râˆ—, the monad of x is the set



If x is finite (limited), the unique real number in the monad of x is called the  standard part of x.
