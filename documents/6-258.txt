   Rosser's theorem      Rosser's theorem   In number theory , Rosser's theorem was proved by J. Barkley Rosser in 1938. Its statement follows.  Let p n be the n th prime number . Then for n ≥ 1        p  n   >   n  ⋅   ln  n     .       subscript  p  n    normal-⋅  n    n      p_{n}>n\cdot\ln n.     This result was subsequently improved upon to be:        p  n   >   n  ⋅   (     ln  n   +   ln   (   ln  n   )     -  1   )     .       subscript  p  n    normal-⋅  n        n       n     1      p_{n}>n\cdot(\ln n+\ln(\ln n)-1).
