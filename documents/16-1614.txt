Hertz–Knudsen equation

In surface chemistry, the Hertz–Knudsen equation describes evaporation rates, named after Heinrich Hertz and Martin Knudsen.



Applications
Non-dissociative adsorption (Langmuirian adsorption)
The Hertz–Knudsen equation can be used to describe the "sticktion" of gas molecule to a given surface, as a result of a flux of the gas onto the surface.
$$\frac{1}{A}\frac{\mathrm{d}N}{\mathrm{d}t} \equiv \phi = \frac{\alpha p}{\sqrt{2\pi m k_B T}} = \frac{\alpha p N_A}{\sqrt{2\pi M RT}},$$
where:12
