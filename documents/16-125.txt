   Tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene synthase      Tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene synthase   Tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene synthase (, ytpB (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name all-trans-heptaprenyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene-forming) . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   all-trans-heptaprenyl diphosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    tetraprenyl-beta-curcumene + diphosphate    This enzyme is isolated from Bacillus subtilis .
