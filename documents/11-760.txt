Nicotinamide-nucleotide amidase

In enzymology, a nicotinamide-nucleotide amidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

beta-nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide + H2O 
 
 
 
  beta-nicotinate D-ribonucleotide + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are beta-nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide and H2O, whereas its two products are beta-nicotinate D-ribonucleotide and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nicotinamide-D-ribonucleotide amidohydrolase. Other names in common use include NMN deamidase, nicotinamide mononucleotide deamidase, and nicotinamide mononucleotide amidohydrolase. This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism.
