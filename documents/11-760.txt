   Nicotinamide-nucleotide amidase      Nicotinamide-nucleotide amidase   In enzymology , a nicotinamide-nucleotide amidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   beta-nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   beta-nicotinate D-ribonucleotide + NH 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are beta-nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide and H 2 O , whereas its two products are beta-nicotinate D-ribonucleotide and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is nicotinamide-D-ribonucleotide amidohydrolase . Other names in common use include NMN deamidase , nicotinamide mononucleotide deamidase , and nicotinamide mononucleotide amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
