Carleman's inequality

Carleman's inequality is an inequality in mathematics, named after Torsten Carleman, who proved it in 19231 and used it to prove the Denjoy–Carleman theorem on quasi-analytic classes.23
Statement
Let a1, a2, a3, ... be a sequence of non-negative real numbers, then



The constant e in the inequality is optimal, that is, the inequality does not always hold if e is replaced by a smaller number. The inequality is strict (it holds with " \int_0^\infty \exp\left\{ \frac{1}{x} \int_0^x \ln f(t) dt \right\} dx \leq e \int_0^\infty f(x) dx 
for any f ≥ 0.
Carleson's inequality
A generalisation, due to Lennart Carleson, states the following:4
for any convex function g with g(0) = 0, and for any -1  \int_0^\infty x^p e^{-g(x)/x} dx \leq e^{p+1} \int_0^\infty x^p e^{-g'(x)} dx. \,
Carleman's inequality follows from the case p = 0.
Proof
An elementary proof is sketched below. From the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means applied to the numbers 
 
 




where MG stands for geometric mean, and MA — for arithmetic mean. The Stirling-type inequality 
 
 
 
  applied to 
 
 
 
  implies

proving the inequality. Moreover, the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means of 
 
 
 
  non-negative numbers is known to be an equality if and only if all the numbers coincide, that is, in the present case, if and only if 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . As a consequence, Carleman's inequality is never an equality for a convergent series, unless all 
 
 
 
  vanish, just because the harmonic series is divergent.
One can also prove Carleman's inequality by starting with Hardy's inequality



for the non-negative numbers a1,a2,... and p > 1, replacing each an with a, and letting p → ∞.
