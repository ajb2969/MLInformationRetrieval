Homoeoid

 A homoeoid is a shell bounded by two concentric, similar ellipses (in 2D) or ellipsoids (in 3D). When the thickness of the shell becomes negligible, it is called a thin homoeoid.
Mathematical definition
If the outer shell is given by


 
  with semiaxes 
 
 
 
  the inner shell is given for 
 
 
 
  by


 
 .
The thin homoeoid is then given by the limit 
 
 

Physical meaning
A homoeoid can be used as a construction element of a matter or charge distribution. The gravitational or electromagnetic potential of a homoeoid homogeneously filled with matter or charge is constant inside the shell. This means that a test mass or charge will not feel any force inside the shell.
