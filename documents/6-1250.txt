   Homoeoid      Homoeoid   A homoeoid is a shell bounded by two concentric, similar  ellipses (in 2D) or ellipsoids (in 3D). When the thickness of the shell becomes negligible, it is called a thin homoeoid .  Mathematical definition  If the outer shell is given by         x  2    a  2    +    y  2    b  2    +    z  2    c  2     =  1           superscript  x  2    superscript  a  2       superscript  y  2    superscript  b  2       superscript  z  2    superscript  c  2     1    \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}+\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2}}=1   with semiaxes    a  ,  b  ,  c     a  b  c    a,b,c   the inner shell is given for    0  ≤  m  ≤  1        0  m       1     0\leq m\leq 1   by         x  2    a  2    +    y  2    b  2    +    z  2    c  2     =   m  2            superscript  x  2    superscript  a  2       superscript  y  2    superscript  b  2       superscript  z  2    superscript  c  2      superscript  m  2     \frac{x^{2}}{a^{2}}+\frac{y^{2}}{b^{2}}+\frac{z^{2}}{c^{2}}=m^{2}   .  The thin homoeoid is then given by the limit    m  →  1     normal-→  m  1    m\to 1     Physical meaning  A homoeoid can be used as a construction element of a matter or charge distribution. The gravitational or electromagnetic potential of a homoeoid homogeneously filled with matter or charge is constant inside the shell. This means that a test mass or charge will not feel any force inside the shell.  References   Chandrasekhar, S. : Ellipsoidal Figures of Equilibrium , Yale Univ. Press. London (1969)  Routh, E.
