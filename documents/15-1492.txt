2-Deoxystreptamine glucosyltransferase

2-deoxystreptamine glucosyltransferase (, kanF (gene)) is an enzyme with system name UDP-alpha-D-glucose:2-deoxystreptamine 6-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

UDP-alpha-D-glucose + 2-deoxystreptamine

 
  UDP + 2'-deamino-2'-hydroxyparomamine
 

This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of kanamycin B and kanamycin C.
