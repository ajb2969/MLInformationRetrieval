   Maleylacetoacetate isomerase      Maleylacetoacetate isomerase   In enzymology , a maleylacetoacetate isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-maleylacetoacetate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-fumarylacetoacetate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 4-maleylacetoacetate , and one product , 4-fumarylacetoacetate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically cis-trans isomerases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-maleylacetoacetate cis-trans-isomerase . Other names in common use include maleylacetoacetic isomerase , maleylacetone isomerase , and maleylacetone cis-trans-isomerase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism and styrene degradation .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
