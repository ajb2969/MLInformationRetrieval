Z-channel (information theory)

A Z-channel is a communications channel used in coding theory and information theory to model the behaviour of some data storage systems.
Definition
A Z-channel (or a binary asymmetric channel) is a channel with binary input and binary output where the crossover 1 → 0 occurs with nonnegative probability p, whereas the crossover 0 → 1 never occurs. In other words, if X and Y are the random variables describing the probability distributions of the input and the output of the channel, respectively, then the crossovers of the channel are characterized by the conditional probabilities

Prob{Y = 0 | X = 0} = 1
 
Prob{Y = 0 | X = 1} = p

Prob{Y = 1 | X = 0} = 0
 
Prob{Y = 1 | X = 1} = 1−p


Capacity
The capacity

 
  of the Z-channel 
 
 
 
  with the crossover 1 → 0 probability p, when the input random variable X is distributed according to the Bernoulli distribution with probability α for the occurrence of 0, is calculated as follows.














where 
 
 
 
  is the binary entropy function.
The maximum is attained for


 
  yielding the following value of 
 
 
 
  as a function of p



For small p, the capacity is approximated by


 
  as compared to the capacity 
 
 
 
  of the binary symmetric channel with crossover probability p.
