Vertical exaggeration

 Vertical exaggeration (VE) is a scale that is used in raised-relief maps, plans and technical drawings (cross section perspectives), in order to emphasize vertical features, which might be too small to identify relative to the horizontal scale.

The vertical exaggeration is given by




where H.S. is the horizontal scale and V.S. is the vertical scale.

For example, if  vertically represents  and  horizontally represents , the vertical exaggeration is given by 4000 / 200, which is 20.
Vertical exaggeration is given as a number; for example 5× means that vertical measurements are 5 times greater than horizontal measurements. The above example would be given as 20x. A value of 1× indicates that horizontal and vertical scales are identical, and is regarded as having "no vertical exaggeration." Vertical exaggerations less than 1 are not common, but indicate a reduction in vertical scale (or, equivalently, a horizontal exaggeration). In some cases, if the vertical exaggeration is too high, the map reader may get confused.
