   Robert M. Solovay      Robert M. Solovay   Robert Martin Solovay (born December 15, 1938) is an American  mathematician specializing in set theory .  Solovay earned his Ph.D. from the University of Chicago in 1964 under the direction of Saunders Mac Lane , with a dissertation on A Functorial Form of the Differentiable Riemann–Roch theorem . Solovay has spent his career at the University of California at Berkeley, where his Ph.D. students include W. Hugh Woodin and Matthew Foreman .  Solovay's theorems include:   Solovay's theorem showing that, if one assumes the existence of an inaccessible cardinal , then the statement "every set of real numbers is Lebesgue measurable " is consistent with ZF without the axiom of choice ;  Isolating the notion of 0 # ;  Proving that the existence of a real valued measurable cardinal is equiconsistent with the existence of a measurable cardinal;  Proving that if   λ   λ   \lambda   is a strong limit singular cardinal , greater than a strongly compact cardinal then     2  λ   =   λ  +        superscript  2  λ    superscript  λ      2^{\lambda}=\lambda^{+}   holds;  Proving that if   κ   κ   \kappa   is an uncountable regular cardinal, and    S  ⊆  κ      S  κ    S\subseteq\kappa   is a stationary set , then   S   S   S   can be decomposed into the union of   κ   κ   \kappa   disjoint stationary sets;  With Stanley Tennenbaum , developing the method of iterated forcing and showing the consistency of Suslin's hypothesis .  Outside of set theory, developing (with Volker Strassen ) the Solovay–Strassen primality test , used to identify large natural numbers that are prime with high probability . This method has had implications for cryptography .  Proving that GL (the normal modal logic which has the instances of the schema    □   (  □  A  →  A  )   →  □  A     fragments  □   fragments  normal-(  □  A  normal-→  A  normal-)   normal-→  □  A    \Box(\Box A\to A)\to\Box A   as additional axioms) completely axiomatizes the logic of the provability predicate of Peano Arithmetic .
