   Phase angle      Phase angle   In the context of phasors , phase angle refers to the angular component of the complex number representation of the function. The notation     A   \ang   θ   ,      A  \ang  θ    A\ang\!\ \theta,   for a vector with magnitude (or amplitude ) A and phase angle θ, is called angle notation . This notation is frequently used to represent an electrical impedance . In this case the phase angle is the phase difference between the voltage applied to the impedance and the current driven through it.  In the context of periodic phenomena, such as a wave , phase angle is synonymous with phase .
