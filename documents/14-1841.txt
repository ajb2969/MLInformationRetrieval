   Rizza manifold      Rizza manifold   In differential geometry a Rizza manifold , named after Giovanni Battista Rizza , 1 is an almost complex manifold also supporting a Finsler structure : this kind of manifold is also referred as almost Hermitian Finsler manifold . 2  Historical notes  The history of Rizza manifolds follows the history of the structure that such objects carry. According to , the geometry of complex  Finsler structures was first studied in the paper : 3 however, Rizza announced his results nearly two years before, in the short communications  and , proving them in the article , nearly one year earlier than the one cited by Kobayashi. Rizza called this differential geometric structure, defined on even-dimensional  manifolds , "Struttura di Finsler quasi Hermitiana": 4 his motivation for the introduction of the concept seems to be the aim of comparing two different structures existing on the same manifold. himself states:-"L'esistenza di strutture di tipo diverso su una medesima varietà dà sempre luogo a problemi di confronto (The existence of structures of different kind on the same manifold always gives rise to comparison problems) ". Later  started calling this structure "Rizza structure ", and manifolds carrying it " Rizza manifolds''". 5  Formal definition  The content of this paragraph closely follows references  and , borrowing the scheme of notation equally from both sources. Precisely, given a differentiable manifold  M and one of its points  x ∈ M   TM is the tangent bundle of M ;  T x M is the tangent space at x ;   1|Definition 1. Let M be a 2n -dimensional  Finsler manifold , n ≥ 1, and let F : TM → ℝ its Finsler function. If the condition   2|(1)       F   (  x  ,   c  y   )    =    |  c  |   F   (  x  ,  y  )        ∀  c   ∈  ℂ   ,    x  ∈  M   ,   y  ∈    T  x   M         formulae-sequence      F   x    c  y         c   F   x  y      formulae-sequence     for-all  c   ℂ    formulae-sequence    x  M     y     subscript  T  x   M        F(x,cy)=|c|F(x,y)\qquad\forall c\in\mathbb{C},\quad x\in M,\quad y\in T_{x}M      holds true, then M is a Rizza Manifold .
