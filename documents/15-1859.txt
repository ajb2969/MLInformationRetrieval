   World manifold      World manifold   In gravitation theory , a world manifold endowed with some Lorentzian  pseudo-Riemannian metric and an associated space-time structure is a space-time . Gravitation theory is formulated as classical field theory on natural bundles over a world manifold.  Topology  A world manifold is a four-dimensional orientable real smooth manifold . It is assumed to be a Hausdorff and second countable  topological space . Consequently, it is a locally compact space which is a union of a countable number of compact subsets, a separable space , a paracompact and completely regular space . Being paracompact, a world manifold admits a partition of unity by smooth functions. It should be emphasized that paracompactness is an essential characteristic of a world manifold. It is necessary and sufficient in order that a world manifold admits a Riemannian metric and necessary for the existence of a pseudo-Riemannian metric. A world manifold is assumed to be connected and, consequently, it is arcwise connected .  Riemannian structure  The tangent bundle     T  X      T  X    TX   of a world manifold   X   X   X   and the associated principal  frame bundle     F  X      F  X    FX   of linear tangent frames in    T  X      T  X    TX   possess a general linear group  structure group     G   L  +    (  4  ,  ‚Ñù  )       G   superscript  L     4  ‚Ñù     GL^{+}(4,\mathbb{R})   . A world manifold   X   X   X   is said to be parallelizable if the tangent bundle    T  X      T  X    TX   and, accordingly, the frame bundle    F  X      F  X    FX   are trivial, i.e., there exists a global section (a frame field ) of    F  X      F  X    FX   . It is essential that the tangent and associated bundles over a world manifold admit a bundle atlas of finite number of trivialization charts.  Tangent and frame bundles over a world manifold are natural bundles characterized by general covariant transformations . These transformations are gauge symmetries of gravitation theory on a world manifold.  By virtue of the well-known theorem on structure group reduction , a structure group    G   L  +    (  4  ,  ‚Ñù  )       G   superscript  L     4  ‚Ñù     GL^{+}(4,\mathbb{R})   of a frame bundle    F  X      F  X    FX   over a world manifold   X   X   X   is always reducible to its maximal compact subgroup    S  O   (  4  )       S  O  4    SO(4)   . The corresponding global section of the quotient bundle      F  X   /  S   O   (  4  )           F  X   S   O  4    FX/SO(4)   is a Riemannian metric    g  R     superscript  g  R    g^{R}   on   X   X   X   . Thus, a world manifold always admits a Riemannian metric which makes   X   X   X   a metric topological space .  Lorentzian structure  In accordance with the geometric Equivalence Principle , a world manifold possesses a Lorentzian structure , i.e., a structure group of a frame bundle    F  X      F  X    FX   must be reduced to a Lorentz group     S  O   (  1  ,  3  )       S  O   1  3     SO(1,3)   . The corresponding global section of the quotient bundle      F  X   /  S   O   (  1  ,  3  )           F  X   S   O   1  3     FX/SO(1,3)   is a pseudo-Riemannian metric   g   g   g   of signature    (  +  ,  -  -  -  )     fragments  normal-(   normal-,     normal-)    (+,---)   on   X   X   X   . It is treated as a gravitational field in General Relativity and as a classical Higgs field in gauge gravitation theory .  A Lorentzian structure need not exist. Therefore a world manifold is assumed to satisfy a certain topological condition. It is either a noncompact topological space or a compact space with a zero Euler characteristic . Usually, one also requires that a world manifold admits a spinor structure in order to describe Dirac fermion fields in gravitation theory. There is the additional topological obstruction to the existence of this structure. In particular, a noncompact world manifold must be parallelizable.  Space-time structure  If a structure group of a frame bundle    F  X      F  X    FX   is reducible to a Lorentz group, the latter is always reducible to its maximal compact subgroup    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   . Thus, there is the commutative diagram       G  L   (  4  ,  ‚Ñù  )    ‚Üí   S  O   (  4  )       normal-‚Üí    G  L   4  ‚Ñù      S  O  4     GL(4,\mathbb{R})\to SO(4)         ‚Üì  ‚Üì     normal-‚Üì  normal-‚Üì    \downarrow\qquad\qquad\qquad\quad\downarrow          S  O   (  1  ,  3  )    ‚Üí   S  O   (  3  )       normal-‚Üí    S  O   1  3      S  O  3     SO(1,3)\to SO(3)     of the reduction of structure groups of a frame bundle    F  X      F  X    FX   in gravitation theory. This reduction diagram results in the following.  (i) In gravitation theory on a world manifold   X   X   X   , one can always choose an atlas of a frame bundle    F  X      F  X    FX   (characterized by local frame fields    {   h  Œª   }      superscript  h  Œª     \{h^{\lambda}\}   ) with    S  O   (  3  )       S  O  3    SO(3)   -valued transition functions. These transition functions preserve a time-like component     h  0   =    h  0  Œº    ‚àÇ  Œº         subscript  h  0      subscript   superscript  h  Œº   0    subscript   Œº      h_{0}=h^{\mu}_{0}\partial_{\mu}   of local frame fields which, therefore, is globally defined. It is a nowhere vanishing vector field on   X   X   X   . Accordingly, the dual time-like covector field     h  0   =    h  Œª  0   d   x  Œª         superscript  h  0      subscript   superscript  h  0   Œª   d   superscript  x  Œª      h^{0}=h^{0}_{\lambda}dx^{\lambda}   also is globally defined, and it yields a spatial distribution     ùîâ  ‚äÇ   T  X       ùîâ    T  X     \mathfrak{F}\subset TX   on   X   X   X   such that     h  0   ‚åã  ùîâ  =  0     fragments   superscript  h  0   normal-‚åã  F   0    h^{0}\rfloor\mathfrak{F}=0   . Then the tangent bundle    T  X      T  X    TX   of a world manifold   X   X   X   admits a space-time decomposition     T  X   =   ùîâ  ‚äï    T  0   X          T  X    direct-sum  ùîâ     superscript  T  0   X      TX=\mathfrak{F}\oplus T^{0}X   , where     T  0   X       superscript  T  0   X    T^{0}X   is a one-dimensional fibre bundle spanned by a time-like vector field    h  0     subscript  h  0    h_{0}   . This decomposition, is called the   g   g   g   -compatible space-time structure . It makes a world manifold the space-time .  (ii) Given the above mentioned diagram of reduction of structure groups, let   g   g   g   and    g  R     superscript  g  R    g^{R}   be the corresponding pseudo-Riemannian and Riemannian metrics on   X   X   X   . They form a triple    (  g  ,   g  R   ,   h  0   )     g   superscript  g  R    superscript  h  0     (g,g^{R},h^{0})   obeying the relation      g  =     2   h  0    ‚äó   h  0    -   g  R        g     tensor-product    2   superscript  h  0     superscript  h  0     superscript  g  R      g=2h^{0}\otimes h^{0}-g^{R}   .  Conversely, let a world manifold   X   X   X   admit a nowhere vanishing one-form   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   (or, equivalently, a nowhere vanishing vector field). Then any Riemannian metric    g  R     superscript  g  R    g^{R}   on   X   X   X   yields the pseudo-Riemannian metric      g  =      2    g  R    (  œÉ  ,  œÉ  )     œÉ   ‚äó  œÉ   -   g  R        g     tensor-product      2     superscript  g  R    œÉ  œÉ     œÉ   œÉ    superscript  g  R      g=\frac{2}{g^{R}(\sigma,\sigma)}\sigma\otimes\sigma-g^{R}   .  It follows that a world manifold   X   X   X   admits a pseudo-Riemannian metric if and only if there exists a nowhere vanishing vector (or covector) field on   X   X   X   .  Let us note that a   g   g   g   -compatible Riemannian metric    g  R     superscript  g  R    g^{R}   in a triple    (  g  ,   g  R   ,   h  0   )     g   superscript  g  R    superscript  h  0     (g,g^{R},h^{0})   defines a   g   g   g   -compatible distance function on a world manifold   X   X   X   . Such a function brings   X   X   X   into a metric space whose locally Euclidean topology is equivalent to a manifold topology on   X   X   X   . Given a gravitational field   g   g   g   , the   g   g   g   -compatible Riemannian metrics and the corresponding distance functions are different for different spatial distributions   ùîâ   ùîâ   \mathfrak{F}   and    ùîâ  ‚Ä≤     superscript  ùîâ  normal-‚Ä≤    \mathfrak{F}^{\prime}   . It follows that physical observers associated with these different spatial distributions perceive a world manifold   X   X   X   as different Riemannian spaces. The well-known relativistic changes of sizes of moving bodies exemplify this phenomenon.  However, one attempts to derive a world topology directly from a space-time structure (a path topology , an Alexandrov topology ). If a space-time satisfies the strong causality condition , such topologies coincide with a familiar manifold topology of a world manifold. In a general case, they however are rather extraordinary.  Causality conditions  A space-time structure is called integrable if a spatial distribution   ùîâ   ùîâ   \mathfrak{F}   is involutive. In this case, its integral manifolds constitute a spatial foliation of a world manifold whose leaves are spatial three-dimensional subspaces. A spatial foliation is called causal if no curve transversal to its leaves intersects each leave more than once. This condition is equivalent to the stable causality of Stephen Hawking . A space-time foliation is causal if and only if it is a foliation of level surfaces of some smooth real function on   X   X   X   whose differential nowhere vanishes. Such a foliation is a fibred manifold     X  ‚Üí  ‚Ñù     normal-‚Üí  X  ‚Ñù    X\to\mathbb{R}   . However, this is not the case of a compact world manifold which can not be a fibred manifold over   ‚Ñù   ‚Ñù   \mathbb{R}   .  The stable causality does not provide the simplest causal structure. If a fibred manifold    X  ‚Üí  ‚Ñù     normal-‚Üí  X  ‚Ñù    X\to\mathbb{R}   is a fibre bundle, it is trivial, i.e., a world manifold   X   X   X   is a globally hyperbolic manifold     X  =   ‚Ñù  √ó  M       X    ‚Ñù  M     X=\mathbb{R}\times M   . Since any oriented three-dimensional manifold is parallelizable, a globally hyperbolic world manifold is parallelizable.
