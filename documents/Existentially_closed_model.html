<h1>Existentially closed model</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a href="model_theory" title="wikilink">model theory</a>, a branch of <a href="mathematical_logic" title="wikilink">mathematical logic</a>, the notion of an <strong>existentially closed model</strong> (or <strong>existentially complete model</strong>) of a <a href="theory_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">theory</a> generalizes the notions of <a href="algebraically_closed_field" title="wikilink">algebraically closed fields</a> (for the theory of <a href="field_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">fields</a>), <a href="real_closed_field" title="wikilink">real closed fields</a> (for the theory of ordered fields), <a href="divisible_group" title="wikilink">existentially closed groups</a> (for the class of groups), and dense linear orders without endpoints (for the class of linear orders).</p>

<p>A model <em>M</em> of a theory <em>T</em> is called existentially closed in <em>T</em> if it is existentially closed in every superstructure <em>N</em> which is itself a model of <em>T</em>. More generally, a structure <em>M</em> is called existentially closed in a class <em>K</em> of structures (in which it is contained as a member) if <em>M</em> is existentially closed in every superstructure <em>N</em> which is itself a member of <em>K</em>.</p>

<p>The <strong>existential closure</strong> in <em>K</em> of a member <em>M</em> of <em>K</em>, when it exists, is, up to isomorphism, the least existentially closed superstructure of <em>M</em>. More precisely, it is any extensionally closed superstructure <em>M</em><sup>∗</sup> of <em>M</em> such that for every existentially closed superstructure <em>N</em> of <em>M</em>, <em>M</em><sup>∗</sup> is isomorphic to a substructure of <em>N</em> via an isomorphism that is the identity on <em>M</em>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>Let σ = (+,×,0,1) be the <a href="signature_(logic)" title="wikilink">signature</a> of fields, i.e. +,× are binary relation symbols and 0,1 are constant symbols. Let <em>K</em> be the class of structures of signature σ which are fields. If <em>A</em> is a subfield of <em>B</em>, then <em>A</em> is existentially closed in <em>B</em> if and only if every system of <a href="polynomial" title="wikilink">polynomials</a> over <em>A</em> which has a solution in <em>B</em> also has a solution in <em>A</em>. It follows that the existentially closed members of <em>K</em> are exactly the algebraically closed fields.</p>

<p>Similarly in the class of <a href="ordered_field" title="wikilink">ordered fields</a>, the existentially closed structures are the <a href="real_closed_field" title="wikilink">real closed fields</a>. In the class of <a href="total_order" title="wikilink">totally ordered structures</a>, the existentially closed structures are those that are <a href="dense_order" title="wikilink">dense</a> without endpoints, while the existential closure of any countable (including empty) total order is, up to isomorphism, the countable dense total order without endpoints, namely the <a href="order_type" title="wikilink">order type</a> of the <a class="uri" href="rationals" title="wikilink">rationals</a>.</p>
