   Peters polynomials      Peters polynomials   In mathematics, the Peters polynomials  s n ( x ) are polynomials studied by  given by the generating function       ∑     s  n    (  x  )    t  n    /   n  !     =     (   1  +  t   )   x     (   1  +    (   1  +  t   )   λ    )    -  μ                subscript  s  n   x   superscript  t  n      n        superscript    1  t   x    superscript    1   superscript    1  t   λ      μ       \displaystyle\sum s_{n}(x)t^{n}/n!=\frac{(1+t)^{x}}{(1+(1+t)^{\lambda})^{-\mu}}   , . They are a generalization of the Boole polynomials .  See also   Umbral calculus   References       Reprinted by Dover, 2005   "  Category:Polynomials
