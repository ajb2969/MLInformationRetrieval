   Centered octagonal number      Centered octagonal number   (Figure)  Centered octagonal number.svg   A centered octagonal number is a centered  figurate number that represents an octagon with a dot in the center and all other dots surrounding the center dot in successive octagonal layers. 1 The centered octagonal numbers are the same as the odd  square numbers . 2 Thus, the n th centered octagonal number is given by the formula        (    2  n   -  1   )   2   =     4   n  2    -   4  n    +  1.        superscript      2  n   1   2         4   superscript  n  2      4  n    1.     (2n-1)^{2}=4n^{2}-4n+1.   The first few centered octagonal numbers are 3   1 , 9 , 25 , 49 , 81 , 121 , 169 , 225, 289, 361, 441, 529, 625, 729, 841, 961, 1089 .   Calculating Ramanujan's tau function on a centered octagonal number yields an odd number, whereas for any other number the function yields an even number. 4  See also   Octagonal number   References  "  Category:Figurate numbers     . ↩   ↩
