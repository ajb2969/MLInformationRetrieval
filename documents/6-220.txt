   Ky Fan inequality      Ky Fan inequality   In mathematics , there are two different results that share the common name of the Ky Fan inequality . One is an inequality involving the geometric mean and arithmetic mean of two sets of real numbers of the unit interval . The result was published on page 5 of the book Inequalities by Beckenbach and Bellman (1961), who refer to an unpublished result of Ky Fan . They mention the result in connection with the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means and Augustin Louis Cauchy 's proof of this inequality by forward-backward-induction; a method which can also be used to prove the Ky Fan inequality.  The Ky Fan inequality is a special case of Levinson's inequality and also the starting point for several generalizations and refinements, some of them are given in the references below.  Statement of the classical version  If x i with 0 ≤ x i ≤ ½ for i = 1, ..., n are real numbers, then         (    ∏   i  =  1   n    x  i    )    1  /  n      (    ∏   i  =  1   n    (   1  -   x  i    )    )    1  /  n     ≤     1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    x  i       1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    (   1  -   x  i    )             superscript    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    subscript  x  i      1  n     superscript    superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n     1   subscript  x  i       1  n           1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  x  i         1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n     1   subscript  x  i         \frac{\bigl(\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}\bigr)^{1/n}}{\bigl(\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-x_{i})%

 \biggl(\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-x_{i})\biggr)^{1/n}     denote the arithmetic and geometric mean, respectively, of 1 − x 1 , . . ., 1 − x n . Then the Ky Fan inequality can be written as         G  n    G  n  ′    ≤    A  n    A  n  ′     ,         subscript  G  n    superscript   subscript  G  n   normal-′       subscript  A  n    superscript   subscript  A  n   normal-′      \frac{G_{n}}{G_{n}^{\prime}}\leq\frac{A_{n}}{A_{n}^{\prime}},     which shows the similarity to the inequality of arithmetic and geometric means given by G n ≤ A n .  Generalization with weights  If x i ∈ [0,½] and γ i ∈ [0,1] for i = 1, . . ., n are real numbers satisfying γ 1 + . . . + γ n = 1, then         ∏   i  =  1   n    x  i   γ  i       ∏   i  =  1   n     (   1  -   x  i    )    γ  i      ≤     ∑   i  =  1   n     γ  i    x  i       ∑   i  =  1   n     γ  i    (   1  -   x  i    )              superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    superscript   subscript  x  i    subscript  γ  i       superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    superscript    1   subscript  x  i     subscript  γ  i          superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  γ  i    subscript  x  i       superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  γ  i     1   subscript  x  i         \frac{\prod_{i=1}^{n}x_{i}^{\gamma_{i}}}{\prod_{i=1}^{n}(1-x_{i})^{\gamma_{i}}%
 }\leq\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\gamma_{i}x_{i}}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}\gamma_{i}(1-x_{i})}     with the convention 0 0 := 0. Equality holds if and only if either   γ i x i = 0 for all i = 1, . . ., n or  all x i > 0 and there exists x ∈ (0,½] such that x = x i for all i = 1, . . ., n with γ i > 0.   The classical version corresponds to γ i = 1/ n for all i = 1, . . ., n .  Proof of the generalization  Idea: Apply Jensen's inequality to the strictly concave function         f   (  x  )    :=    ln  x   -   ln   (   1  -  x   )     =   ln   x   1  -  x      ,   x  ∈   (  0  ,    1  2    ]     .     formulae-sequence     assign    f  x       x       1  x              x    1  x         x   0    1  2       f(x):=\ln x-\ln(1-x)=\ln\frac{x}{1-x},\qquad x\in(0,\tfrac{1}{2}].     Detailed proof: (a) If at least one x i is zero, then the left-hand side of the Ky Fan inequality is zero and the inequality is proved. Equality holds if and only if the right-hand side is also zero, which is the case when γ i x i = 0 for all i = 1, . . ., n .  (b) Assume now that all x i > 0. If there is an i with γ i = 0, then the corresponding x i > 0 has no effect on either side of the inequality, hence the i th term can be omitted. Therefore, we may assume that γ i > 0 for all i in the following. If x 1 = x 2 = . . . = x n , then equality holds. It remains to show strict inequality if not all x i are equal.  The function f is strictly concave on (0,½], because we have for its second derivative          f  ′′    (  x  )    =    -   1   x  2     +   1    (   1  -  x   )   2     <  0   ,   x  ∈   (  0  ,    1  2    )     .     formulae-sequence         superscript  f  ′′   x         1   superscript  x  2       1   superscript    1  x   2          0      x   0    1  2       f^{\prime\prime}(x)=-\frac{1}{x^{2}}+\frac{1}{(1-x)^{2}}<0,\qquad x\in(0,%
 \tfrac{1}{2}).     Using the functional equation for the natural logarithm and Jensen's inequality for the strictly concave f , we obtain that  $$\begin{align}
 \ln\frac{ \prod_{i=1}^n x_i^{\gamma_i}}
         { \prod_{i=1}^n (1-x_i)^{\gamma_i} }
 &=\ln\prod_{i=1}^n\Bigl(\frac{x_i}{1-x_i}\Bigr)^{\gamma_i}\\
 &=\sum_{i=1}^n \gamma_i f(x_i)\\
 & where we used in the last step that the ''γ i '' sum to one. Taking the exponential of both sides gives the Ky Fan inequality.
 
 ==The Ky Fan Inequality in Game Theory==
 
 A second inequality is also called the Ky Fan Inequality, because of a 1972 paper, "A minimax inequality and its applications".
 This second inequality is equivalent to the [[Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem]], but is often more convenient.  Let ''S'' be a [[compact space|compact]] [[convex set|convex]] subset of a finite-dimensional [[vector space]] ''V'', and let ''f(x,y)'' be a function from ''S × S'' to the [[real numbers]] that is [[lower semicontinuous]] in ''x'', [[concave function|concave]] in ''y'' and has ''f(z,z) ≤ 0'' for all ''z'' in ''S''.
 Then there exists ''x * ∈ S '' such that for all ''y ∈ S, f( x * , y ) ≤ 0 ''.  This Ky Fan Inequality is used to establish the existence of
 equilibria in various games studied in economics.
