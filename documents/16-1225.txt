Mean field particle methods

Mean field particle methods are a broad class of interacting type Monte Carlo algorithms for simulating from a sequence of probability distributions satisfying a nonlinear evolution equation1234 These flows of probability measures can always be interpreted as the distributions of the random states of a Markov process whose transition probabilities depends on the distributions of the current random states.56 A natural way to simulate these sophisticated nonlinear Markov processes is to sample a large number of copies of the process, replacing in the evolution equation the unknown distributions of the random states by the sampled empirical measures. In contrast with traditional Monte Carlo and Markov chain Monte Carlo methodologies these mean field particle techniques rely on sequential interacting samples. The terminology mean field reflects the fact that each of the samples (a.k.a. particles, individuals, walkers, agents, creatures, or phenotypes) interacts with the empirical measures of the process. When the size of the system tends to infinity, these random empirical measures converge to the deterministic distribution of the random states of the nonlinear Markov chain, so that the statistical interaction between particles vanishes. In other words, starting with a chaotic configuration based on independent copies of initial state of the nonlinear Markov chain model, the chaos propagates at any time horizon as the size the system tends to infinity; that is, finite blocks of particles reduces to independent copies of the nonlinear Markov process. This result is called the propagation of chaos property.789 The terminology "propagation of chaos" originated with the work of Mark Kac in 1976 on a colliding mean field kinetic gas model10
History
The theory of mean field interacting particle models had certainly started by the mid-1960s, with the work of Henry P. McKean Jr. on Markov interpretations of a class of nonlinear parabolic partial differential equations arising in fluid mechanics.1112 The mathematical foundations of these classes of models were developed from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s by several mathematicians, including Werner Braun, Klaus Hepp,13 Karl Oelschläger,141516 Gérard Ben Arous and Marc Brunaud,17 Donald Dawson, Jean Vaillancourt18 and Jürgen Gärtner,1920 Christian Léonard,21 Sylvie Méléard, Sylvie Roelly,22 Alain-Sol Sznitman2324 and Hiroshi Tanaka25 for diffusion type models; F. Alberto Grünbaum,26 Tokuzo Shiga, Hiroshi Tanaka,27 Sylvie Méléard and Carl Graham282930 for general classes of interacting jump-diffusion processes.
We also quote an earlier pioneering article by Theodore E. Harris and Herman Kahn, published in 1951, using mean field but heuristic-like genetic methods for estimating particle transmission energies.31 Mean field genetic type particle methodologies are also used as heuristic natural search algorithms (a.k.a. metaheuristic) in evolutionary computing. The origins of these mean field computational techniques can be traced to 1950 and 1954 with the work of Alan Turing on genetic type mutation-selection learning machines 32 and the articles by Nils Aall Barricelli at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey.3334 The Australian geneticist Alex Fraser also published in 1957 a series of papers on the genetic type simulation of artificial selection of organisms.35
Quantum Monte Carlo, and more specifically Diffusion Monte Carlo methods can also be interpreted as a mean field particle approximation of Feynman-Kac path integrals.36373839404142 The origins of Quantum Monte Carlo methods are often attributed to Enrico Fermi and Robert Richtmyer who developed in 1948 a mean field particle interpretation of neutron-chain reactions,43 but the first heuristic-like and genetic type particle algorithm (a.k.a. Resampled or Reconfiguration Monte Carlo methods) for estimating ground state energies of quantum systems (in reduced matrix models) is due to Jack H. Hetherington in 198444 In molecular chemistry, the use of genetic heuristic-like particle methodologies (a.k.a. pruning and enrichment strategies) can be traced back to 1955 with the seminal work of Marshall. N. Rosenbluth and Arianna. W. Rosenbluth.45
The first pioneering articles on the applications of these heuristic-like particle methodologies in nonlinear filtering problems were the independent studies of Neil Gordon, David Salmon and Adrian Smith (bootstrap filter),46 Genshiro Kitagawa (Monte Carlo filter) ,47 and the one by Himilcon Carvalho, Pierre Del Moral, André Monin and Gérard Salut48 published in the 1990s. The term interacting "particle filters" was first coined in 1996 by Del Moral.49 Particle filters were also developed in signal processing in the early 1989-1992 by P. Del Moral, J.C. Noyer, G. Rigal, and G. Salut in the LAAS-CNRS in a series of restricted and classified research reports with STCAN (Service Technique des Constructions et Armes Navales), the IT company DIGILOG, and the LAAS-CNRS (the Laboratory for Analysis and Architecture of Systems) on RADAR/SONAR and GPS signal processing problems.505152535455
The foundations and the first rigorous analysis on the convergence of genetic type models and mean field Feynman-Kac particle methodologies are due to Pierre Del Moral5657 in 1996. Branching type particle methodologies with varying population sizes were also developed in the end of the 1990s by Dan Crisan, Jessica Gaines and Terry Lyons,585960 and by Dan Crisan, Pierre Del Moral and Terry Lyons.61 The first uniform convergence results with respect to the time parameter for mean field particle models were developed in the end of the 1990s by Pierre Del Moral and Alice Guionnet6263 for interacting jump type processes, and by Florent Malrieu for nonlinear diffusion type processes.64
New classes of mean field particle simulation techniques for Feynman-Kac path-integration problems includes genealogical tree based models,656667 backward particle models,6869 adaptive mean field particle models,70 island type particle models,7172 and particle Markov chain Monte Carlo methodologies7374
Applications
In physics, and more particularly in statistical mechanics, these nonlinear evolution equations are often used to describe the statistical behavior of microscopic interacting particles in a fluid or in some condensed matter. In this context, the random evolution of a virtual fluid or a gas particle is represented by McKean-Vlasov diffusion processes, reaction–diffusion systems, or Boltzmann type collision processes.7576777879 As its name indicates, the mean field particle model represents the collective behavior of microscopic particles weakly interacting with their occupation measures. The macroscopic behavior of these many-body particle systems is encapsulated in the limiting model obtained when the size of the population tends to infinity. Boltzmann equations represent the macroscopic evolution of colliding particles in rarefied gases, while McKean Vlasov diffusions represent the macroscopic behavior of fluid particles and granular gases.
In computational physics and more specifically in quantum mechanics, the ground state energies of quantum systems is associated with the top of the spectrum of Schrödinger's operators. The Schrödinger equation is the quantum mechanics version of the Newton's second law of motion of classical mechanics (the mass times the acceleration is the sum of the forces). This equation represents the wave function (a.k.a. the quantum state) evolution of some physical system, including molecular, atomic of subatomic systems, as well as macroscopic systems like the universe.80 The solution of the imaginary time Schrödinger equation (a.k.a. the heat equation) is given by a Feynman-Kac distribution associated with a free evolution Markov process (often represented by Brownian motions) in the set of electronic or macromolecular configurations and some potential energy function. The long time behavior of these nonlinear semigroups is related to top eigenvalues and ground state energies of Schrödinger's operators.818283848586 The genetic type mean field interpretation of these Feynman-Kac models are termed Resample Monte Carlo, or Diffusion Monte Carlo methods. These branching type evolutionary algorithms are based on mutation and selection transitions. During the mutation transition, the walkers evolve randomly and independently in a potential energy landscape on particle configurations. The mean field selection process (a.k.a. quantum teleportation, population reconfiguration, resampled transition) is associated with a fitness function that reflects the particle absorption in an energy well. Configurations with low relative energy are more likely to duplicate. In molecular chemistry, and statistical physics Mean field particle methodologies are also used to sample Boltzmann-Gibbs measures associated with some cooling schedule, and to compute their normalizing constants (a.k.a. free energies, or partition functions).87888990
In computational biology, and more specifically in population genetics, spatial branching processes with competitive selection and migration mechanisms can also represented by mean field genetic type population dynamics models.9192 The first moments of the occupation measures of a spatial branching process are given by Feynman-Kac distribution flows.9394 The mean field genetic type approximation of these flows offers a fixed population size interpretation of these branching processes.959697 Extinction probabilities can be interpreted as absorption probabilities of some Markov process evolving in some absorbing environment. These absorption models are represented by Feynman-Kac models.9899100101 The long time behavior of these processes conditioned on non-extinction can be expressed in an equivalent way by quasi-invariant measures, Yaglom limits,102 or invariant measures of nonlinear normalized Feynman-Kac flows.103104105106107108
In computer sciences, and more particularly in artificial intelligence these mean field type genetic algorithms are used as random search heuristics that mimic the process of evolution to generate useful solutions to complex optimization problems.109110111 These stochastic search algorithms belongs to the class of Evolutionary models. The idea is to propagate a population of feasible candidate solutions using mutation and selection mechanisms. The mean field interaction between the individuals is encapsulated in the selection and the cross-over mechanisms.
In mean field games and multi-agent interacting systems theories, mean field particle processes are used to represent the collective behavior of complex systems with interacting individuals.112113114115116117118119 In this context, the mean field interaction is encapsulated in the decision process of interacting agents. The limiting model as the number of agents tends to infinity is sometimes called the continuum model of agents120
In information theory, and more specifically in statistical machine learning and signal processing, mean field particle methods are used to sample sequentially from the conditional distributions of some random process with respect to a sequence of observations or a cascade of rare events.121122123124 In discrete time nonlinear filtering problems, the conditional distributions of the random states of a signal given partial and noisy observations satisfy a nonlinear updating-prediction evolution equation. The updating step is given by Bayes' rule, and the prediction step is a Chapman-Kolmogorov transport equation. The mean field particle interpretation of these nonlinear filtering equations is a genetic type selection-mutation particle algorithm125 During the mutation step, the particles evolve independently of one another according to the Markov transitions of the signal . During the selection stage, particles with small relative likelihood values are killed, while the ones with high relative values are multiplied.126127 These mean field particle techniques are also used to solve multiple-object tracking problems, and more specifically to estimate association measures128129130131
The continuous time version of these particle models are mean field Moran type particle interpretations of the robust optimal filter evolution equations or the Kushner-Stratonotich stochastic partial differential equation.132133134 These genetic type mean field particle algorithms also termed Particle Filters and Sequential Monte Carlo methods are extensively and routinely used in operation research and statistical inference .135

Illustrations of the Mean field simulation method
Countable state space models
To motivate the mean field simulation algorithm let's look at a sequence of probability distributions

 
  on some finite or countable state space 
 
 
 
  satisfying an evolution equation of the form


for some possibly nonlinear mapping 
 
 
 
  from the set 
 
 
 
  of probability measures on 
 
 
 
  into itself. These distributions are given by vectors 
 
 
 
  of numbers 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
  is a mapping from the 
 
 
 
 -unit simplex into itself, where 
 
 
 
  stands for the cardinality of the set 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
  is too large, the solving of the equation () is intractable or computationally very costly. One natural way to approximate these evolution equations is to reduce sequentially the state space using a mean field particle model. One of the simplest mean field simulation scheme is defined by the Markov chain 
 
 
 
  on the product space 
 
 
 
 , starting with 
 
 
 
  independent random variables with probability distribution 
 
 
 
  and elementary transitions



 
 , with the empirical measure

 
  and the indicator function

 
  of the state 
 
 
 
 .

In other words, given 
 
 
 
  the samples 
 
 
 
  are independent random variables with probability distribution 
 
 
 
 . The rationale behind this mean field simulation technique is the following: We expect that when 
 
 
 
  is a good approximation of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is an approximation of 
 
 
 
  Thus, since 
 
 
 
  is the empirical measure of 
 
 
 
  conditionally independent random variables with common probability distribution 
 
 
 
 , we expect 
 
 
 
  to be a good approximation of 
 
 
 
 .
Another strategy is to find a collection 
 
 
 
  of stochastic matrices indexed by 
 
 
 
  such that


This formula allows us to interpret the sequence 
 
 
 
  as the probability distributions of the random states 
 
 
 
  of the nonlinear Markov chain model with elementary transitions



 
  with 
 
 


A collection of Markov transitions 
 
 
 
  satisfying the equation () is called a McKean interpretation of the sequence of measures 
 
 
 
 . The mean field particle interpretation of () is now defined by the Markov chain 
 
 
 
  on the product space 
 
 
 
 , starting with 
 
 
 
  independent random copies of 
 
 
 
  and elementary transitions



 
 , with the empirical measure 
 
 


Under some weak regularity conditions140 on the mapping 
 
 
 
  for any function 
 
 
 
 , we have the almost sure convergence





These nonlinear Markov processes and their mean field particle interpretation can be extended to time non homogeneous models on general measurable state spaces.141
Feynman-Kac models
To illustrate the abstract models presented above, we consider a stochastic matrix 
 
 
 
  and some function 
 
 
 
 . We associate with these two objects the mapping





with the entries 
 
 
 
  defined for any 
 
 
 
  by


and the Boltzmann-Gibbs measures 
 
 
 
  defined by





We denote by 
 
 
 
  the collection of stochastic matrices indexed by 
 
 
 
  given by





for some parameter 
 
 
 
 . It is readily checked that the equation () is satisfied. In addition, we can also show (cf. for instance142) that the solution of () is given by the Feynman-Kac formula



 
  with initial distribution 
 
 
 
  and Markov transition 
 
 
 
 . 

gFor any function 
 
 
 
  we have





If 
 
 
 
  is the unit function and 
 
 
 
 , then we have 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . In this situation, the equation () reduces to the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation





The mean field particle interpretation of this Feynman-Kac model is defined by sampling sequentially 
 
 
 
  conditionally independent random variables 
 
 
 
  with probability distribution





In other words, with a probability 
 
 
 
  the particle 
 
 
 
  evolve to a new random state 
 
 
 
  randomly chosen with the probability distribution 
 
 
 
 ; otherwise, 
 
 
 
  jumps to a new location 
 
 
 
  randomly chosen with a probability proportional to 
 
 
 
 , and evolves to a new random state 
 
 
 
  randomly chosen with the probability distribution 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the unit function and 
 
 
 
 , the interaction between the particle vanishes and the particle model reduces to a sequence of independent copies of the Markov chain 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
  the mean field particle model described above reduces to a simple mutation-selection genetic algorithm with fitness function 
 
 
 
  and mutation transition 
 
 
 
 . These nonlinear Markov chain models and their mean field particle interpretation can be extended to time non homogeneous models on general measurable state spaces (including transition states, path spaces and random excursion spaces) and continuous time models.143144145
Gaussian nonlinear state space models
We consider a sequence of real valued random variables 
 
 
 
  indexed by the discrete time index 
 
 
 
  and defined sequentially by the equations


with a collection 
 
 
 
  of independent standard Gaussian random variables, a parameter 
 
 
 
  and some functions 
 
 
 
  from the set of real numbers 
 
 
 
  into itself, and some standard Gaussian initial random state 
 
 
 
 . We let 
 
 
 
  be the probability distribution of the random state 
 
 
 
 ; that is, for any bounded measurable functions

 
  we have



 
 , with 
 
 


The l.h.s. formula is expressed in terms of the Lebesgue integral, and 
 
 
 
  stands for an infinitesimal neighborhood of the state 
 
 
 
 . The Markov transition of the chain is given for any bounded measurable functions 
 
 
 
  by the formula



 
 , with 
 
 


Using the tower property of conditional expectations we prove that the probability distributions 
 
 
 
  satisfy the nonlinear equation





for any bounded measurable functions 
 
 
 
 . This equation is sometimes written in the more synthetic form





The mean field particle interpretation of this model is defined by the Markov chain 
 
 
 
  on the product space 
 
 
 
  defined by





In the above display, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  stands for 
 
 
 
  independent copies of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 . For regular models (for instance for bounded Lipschitz functions 
 
 
 
 ) we have the almost sure convergence



 
 , with the empirical measure 
 
 


for any bounded measurable functions 
 
 
 
 (cf. for instance 146). In the above display, 
 
 
 
  stands for the Dirac measure at the state 
 
 
 
 .
Continuous time mean field models
We consider a standard Brownian motion

 
  (a.k.a. Wiener Process) evaluated on a time mesh sequence 
 
 
 
 . We choose 
 
 
 
  in the equation (), we replace 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and we write 
 
 
 
  instead of 
 
 
 
  the values of the random states evaluated at the time step 
 
 
 
 . Recalling that 
 
 
 
  are independent centered Gaussian random variables with variance 
 
 
 
 , the resulting equation can be rewritten in the following form

-\overline{X}_{t_n}=E\left(a\left(\overline{X}_{t_n}\right)\right)~b(\overline{X}_{t_n})~h+\sigma~\left(\overline{W}_{t_{n+1}}-\overline{W}_{t_n}\right)|4}}

When time step 
 
 
 
  tends to 
 
 
 
 , the above equation converge to the nonlinear diffusion process





The mean field continuous time model associated with these nonlinear diffusions is the (interacting) diffusion process 
 
 
 
  on the product space 
 
 
 
  defined by





In the above display, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  stands for 
 
 
 
  independent copies of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . For regular models (for instance for bounded Lipschitz functions 
 
 
 
 ) we have the almost sure convergence



 
 , with $\textstyle \eta_t=Law\left(\overline{X}_{t}\right)$, and the empirical measure $\eta^N_t=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{1\leq j\leq N}\delta_{\xi^{(N,i)}_t}$

for any bounded measurable functions $\textstyle f$(cf. for instance.147). These nonlinear Markov processes and their mean field particle interpretation can be extended to interacting jump-diffusion processes148149150151
