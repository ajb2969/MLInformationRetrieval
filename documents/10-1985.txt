   Mandelonitrile lyase      Mandelonitrile lyase   In enzymology , a mandelonitrile lyase (, (R)-HNL , (R)-oxynitrilase , (R)-hydroxynitrile lyase ) is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   mandelonitrile   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   hydrogen cyanide + benzaldehyde   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , mandelonitrile , and two products , hydrogen cyanide and benzaldehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is mandelonitrile benzaldehyde-lyase (hydrogen cyanide-forming) . Other names in common use include hydroxynitrile lyase , (R)-oxynitrilase , oxynitrilase , D-oxynitrilase , D-alpha-hydroxynitrile lyase , and mandelonitrile benzaldehyde-lyase . This enzyme participates in cyanoamino acid metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : flavin , and flavoprotein .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
