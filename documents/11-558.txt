   S-succinylglutathione hydrolase      S-succinylglutathione hydrolase   In enzymology , a S-succinylglutathione hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-succinylglutathione + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glutathione + succinate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-succinylglutathione and H 2 O , whereas its two products are glutathione and succinate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-succinylglutathione hydrolase .
