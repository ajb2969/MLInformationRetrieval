S-succinylglutathione hydrolase




S-succinylglutathione hydrolase

In enzymology, a S-succinylglutathione hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

S-succinylglutathione + H2O 
 
 
 
  glutathione + succinate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-succinylglutathione and H2O, whereas its two products are glutathione and succinate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on thioester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-succinylglutathione hydrolase.
