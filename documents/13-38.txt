   Cellular approximation theorem      Cellular approximation theorem   In algebraic topology , in the cellular approximation theorem , a map between CW-complexes can always be taken to be of a specific type. Concretely, if X and Y are CW-complexes, and f : X → Y is a continuous map, then f is said to be cellular , if f takes the n -skeleton of X to the n -skeleton of Y for all n , i.e. if     f   (   X  n   )    ⊆   Y  n         f   superscript  X  n     superscript  Y  n     f(X^{n})\subseteq Y^{n}   for all n . The content of the cellular approximation theorem is then that any continuous map f : X → Y between CW-complexes X and Y is homotopic to a cellular map, and if f is already cellular on a subcomplex A of X , then we can furthermore choose the homotopy to be stationary on A . From an algebraic topological viewpoint, any map between CW-complexes can thus be taken to be cellular.  Idea of proof  The proof can be given by induction after n , with the statement that f is cellular on the skeleton X n . For the base case n=0, notice that every path-component of Y must contain a 0-cell. The image under f of a 0-cell of X can thus be connected to a 0-cell of Y by a path, but this gives a homotopy from f to a map which is cellular on the 0-skeleton of X.  Assume inductively that f is cellular on the ( n − 1)-skeleton of X , and let e n be an n -cell of X . The closure of e n is compact in X , being the image of the characteristic map of the cell, and hence the image of the closure of e n under f is also compact in Y . Then it is a general result of CW-complexes that any compact subspace of a CW-complex meets (that is, intersects  non-trivially ) only finitely many cells of the complex. Thus f ( e n ) meets at most finitely many cells of Y , so we can take     e  k   ⊆  Y       superscript  e  k   Y    e^{k}\subseteq Y   to be a cell of highest dimension meeting f ( e n ). If    k  ≤  n      k  n    k\leq n   , the map f is already cellular on e n , since in this case only cells of the n -skeleton of Y meets f ( e n ), so we may assume that k > n . It is then a technical, non-trivial result (see Hatcher) that the restriction of f to     X   n  -  1    ∪   e  n        superscript  X    n  1     superscript  e  n     X^{n-1}\cup e^{n}   can be homotoped relative to X n-1 to a map missing a point p ∈ e k . Since Y k − { p } deformation retracts onto the subspace Y k - e k , we can further homotope the restriction of f to     X   n  -  1    ∪   e  n        superscript  X    n  1     superscript  e  n     X^{n-1}\cup e^{n}   to a map, say, g , with the property that g ( e n ) misses the cell e k of Y , still relative to X n-1 . Since f ( e n ) met only finitely many cells of Y to begin with, we can repeat this process finitely many times to make    f   (   e  n   )       f   superscript  e  n     f(e^{n})   miss all cells of Y of dimension larger than n .  We repeat this process for every n -cell of X , fixing cells of the subcomplex A on which f is already cellular, and we thus obtain a homotopy (relative to the ( n − 1)-skeleton of X and the n -cells of A ) of the restriction of f to X n to a map cellular on all cells of X of dimension at most n . Using then the homotopy extension property to extend this to a homotopy on all of X , and patching these homotopies together, will finish the proof. For details, consult Hatcher.  Applications  Some homotopy groups  The cellular approximation theorem can be used to immediately calculate some homotopy groups . In particular, if     S  n      superscript  S  n    S^{n}\,   : Give     S  k      superscript  S  k    S^{k}\,   and     S  n      superscript  S  n    S^{n}\,   their canonical CW-structure, with one 0-cell each, and with one n -cell for     S  k      superscript  S  k    S^{k}\,   and one k -cell for     S  n      superscript  S  n    S^{n}\,   . Any base-point preserving map f      S  k      superscript  S  k    S^{k}\,   →      π  n    (   S  k   )    =   0          subscript  π  n    superscript  S  k    0    \pi_{n}(S^{k})=0\,   is by the cellular approximation theorem homotopic to a constant map, whence    A  ⊆   X       A  X    A\subseteq X\,   .  Cellular approximation for pairs  Let f : (X,A) → (Y,B) be a map of CW-pairs , that is, f is a map from X to Y , and the image of    X  -  A      X  A    X-A   under f sits inside B . Then f is homotopic to a cellular map (X,A) → (Y,B) . To see this, restrict f to A and use cellular approximation to obtain a homotopy of f to a cellular map on A . Use the homotopy extension property to extend this homotopy to all of X , and apply cellular approximation again to obtain a map cellular on X , but without violating the cellular property on A .  As a consequence, we have that a CW-pair (X,A) is n-connected , if all cells of    i  ≤   n       i  n    i\leq n\,   have dimension strictly greater than n : If    (   D  i   ,   ∂   D  i    )      superscript  D  i      superscript  D  i      (D^{i},\partial D^{i})\,   , then any map     π  i    (  X  ,  A  )        subscript  π  i    X  A     \pi_{i}(X,A)\,   → (X,A) is homotopic to a cellular map of pairs, and since the n -skeleton of X sits inside A , any such map is homotopic to a map whose image is in A , and hence it is 0 in the relative homotopy group    (  X  ,   X  n   )     X   superscript  X  n     (X,X^{n})\,   . We have in particular that    (  X  ,   X  n   )     X   superscript  X  n     (X,X^{n})\,   is n -connected, so it follows from the long exact sequence of homotopy groups for the pair     π  i    (   X  n   )        subscript  π  i    superscript  X  n     \pi_{i}(X^{n})\,   that we have isomorphisms     π  i    (  X  )        subscript  π  i   X    \pi_{i}(X)\,   →     π  n    (  X  )        subscript  π  n   X    \pi_{n}(X)\,   for all     f   (   X  n   )    ⊆   Y  n         f   superscript  X  n     superscript  Y  n     f(X^{n})\subseteq Y^{n}   →     e  k   ⊆  Y       superscript  e  k   Y    e^{k}\subseteq Y   .
