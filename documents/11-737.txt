Mandelamide amidase

In enzymology, a mandelamide amidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(R)-mandelamide + H2O 
 
 
 
  (R)-mandelate + NH3


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-mandelamide and H2O, whereas its two products are (R)-mandelate and NH3.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is mandelamide hydrolase. This enzyme is also called Pseudomonas mandelamide hydrolase.
