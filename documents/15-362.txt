   Factor system      Factor system   In mathematics, a factor system is a function on a group giving the data required to construct an algebra. A factor system constitutes a realisation of the cocycles in the second cohomology group in group cohomology .  Let G be a group and L a field on which G acts as automorphisms. A cocycle or factor system is a map c : G × G → L * satisfying        c    (  h  ,  k  )   g   c   (   h  k   ,  g  )    =   c   (  h  ,   k  g   )   c   (  k  ,  g  )     .        c   superscript   h  k   g   c     h  k   g      c   h    k  g    c   k  g      c(h,k)^{g}c(hk,g)=c(h,kg)c(k,g).     Cocycles are equivalent if there exists some system of elements a : G → L * with         c  ′    (  g  ,  h  )    =   c   (  g  ,  h  )    (    a  g  h    a  h    a   g  h    -  1     )     .         superscript  c  normal-′    g  h      c   g  h      superscript   subscript  a  g   h    subscript  a  h    superscript   subscript  a    g  h      1        c^{\prime}(g,h)=c(g,h)(a_{g}^{h}a_{h}a_{gh}^{-1}).     Cocycles of the form       c   (  g  ,  h  )    =    a  g  h    a  h    a   g  h    -  1           c   g  h       superscript   subscript  a  g   h    subscript  a  h    superscript   subscript  a    g  h      1       c(g,h)=a_{g}^{h}a_{h}a_{gh}^{-1}     are called split . Cocycles under multiplication modulo split cocycles form a group, the second cohomology group H 2 ( G , L * ).  Crossed product algebras  Let us take the case that G is the Galois group of a field extension  L / K . A factor system c in H 2 ( G , L * ) gives rise to a crossed product algebra  A , which is a K -algebra containing L as a subfield, generated by the elements λ in L and u g with multiplication        λ   u  g    =    u  g    λ  g     ,        λ   subscript  u  g       subscript  u  g    superscript  λ  g      \lambda u_{g}=u_{g}\lambda^{g},            u  g    u  h    =    u   g  h    c   (  g  ,  h  )     .         subscript  u  g    subscript  u  h       subscript  u    g  h    c   g  h      u_{g}u_{h}=u_{gh}c(g,h).     Equivalent factor systems correspond to a change of basis in A over K . We may write       A  =   (  L  ,  G  ,  c  )    .      A   L  G  c     A=(L,G,c).     Every central simple algebra over K that splits over L arises in this way. 1 The tensor product of algebras corresponds to multiplication of the corresponding elements in H 2 . We thus obtain an identification of the Brauer group , where the elements are classes of CSAs over K , with H 2 . 2 3  Cyclic algebra  Let us further restrict to the case that L / K is cyclic with Galois group G of order n generated by t . Let A be a crossed product ( L , G , c ) with factor set c . Let u = u t be the generator in A corresponding to t . We can define the other generators       u   t  i    =    u  i         subscript  u   superscript  t  i     superscript  u  i     u_{t^{i}}=u^{i}\,     and then we have u n = a in K . This element a specifies a cocycle c by       c   (   t  i   ,   t  j   )    =   {     1        if  i   +  j   <  n   ,       a        if  i   +  j   ≥  n   .             c    superscript  t  i    superscript  t  j      cases  1        if  i   j   n   a        if  i   j   n      c(t^{i},t^{j})=\begin{cases}1&\text{if }i+j     It thus makes sense to denote A simply by ( L , t , a ). However a is not uniquely specified by A since we can multiply u by any element λ of L * and then a is multiplied by the product of the conjugates of λ. Hence A corresponds to an element of the norm residue group K * /N L / K L * . We obtain the isomorphisms        Br   (   L  /  K   )    ≡     K  *   /   N   L  /  K      L  *    ≡    H  2    (  G  ,   L  *   )     .         Br    L  K         superscript  K     subscript  N    L  K      superscript  L             superscript  H  2    G   superscript  L         \operatorname{Br}(L/K)\equiv K^{*}/N_{L/K}L^{*}\equiv H^{2}(G,L^{*}).
