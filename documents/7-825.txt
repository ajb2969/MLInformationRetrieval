   Wave function renormalization      Wave function renormalization   In quantum field theory , wave function renormalization is a rescaling, or renormalization , of quantum fields to take into account the effects of interactions. For a noninteracting or free field , the field operator creates or annihilates a single particle with probability 1. Once interactions are included, however, this probability is modified in general to Z    ≠     \neq   1. This shows up when one calculates the propagator beyond leading order ; e.g., for a scalar field,       i     p  2   -   m  0  2    +   i  ε     →    i  Z      p  2   -   m  2    +   i  ε        normal-→    i       superscript  p  2    superscript   subscript  m  0   2      i  ε         i  Z        superscript  p  2    superscript  m  2      i  ε       \frac{i}{p^{2}-m_{0}^{2}+i\varepsilon}\rightarrow\frac{iZ}{p^{2}-m^{2}+i\varepsilon}     (The shift of the mass from m 0 to m constitutes the mass renormalization .)  One possible wave function renormalization, which happens to be scale independent, is to rescale the fields so that the Lehmann weight ( Z in the formula above) of their quanta is 1. (It's trickier to define it for unstable particles). For the purposes of studying renormalization group flows , if the coefficient of the kinetic term in the action at the scale Λ is Z , then the field is rescaled by    Z      Z    \sqrt{Z}   . A scale dependent wavefunction renormalization for a field means that that field has an anomalous scaling dimension .
