Ming Antu's infinite series expansion of trigonometric functions. Ming Antu, a court mathematician of the Qing dynasty did extensive work on infinite series expansion of trigonometric functions in his masterpiece Geyuan Milv Jifa(Quick Method of Dissecting the Circle and Determination of The Precise Ratio of the Circe). Ming Antu built geometrical models based on a major arc of a circle and nth dissection of the major arc. In Fig 1, AE is the major chord of arc ABCDE, and AB, BC, CD, DE are its nth equal segments. If chord AE = y, chord AB = BC = CD = DE = x, find chord y as infinite series expansion of chord x. He studied the cases of n = 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 100, 1000 and 10000 in great detail in vol 3 and vol 4 of Geyuan Milv Jifa.
Historical background
In 1701, French Jesuit missionary(Pierre Jartoux 1668-1720) came to China, he brought along three infinite series expansion of trigonometry functions by Isaac Newton and J. Gregory:1









These infinite series stirred up great interest among Chinese mathematicians,as calculation of 
 
 
 
  with these "quick methods" involve only multiplication, addition or subtraction, much faster than classic Liu Hui's π algorithm which involves taking square roots. However, Jartoux did not bring along the method for deriving these infinite series.Ming Antu suspected that the westerner did not want to share their secret,hence he set to work on it, and spent on and off for thirty years and completed a manuscript Geyuan Milv Jifa, he created geometrical models for obtaining trigonometric infinite series, and not only found the method for deriving the above three infinite series, but also discovered six more infinite series. In the process, he discovered and applied Catalan number.
Two-segment chord
 Figure 2 is Ming Antu's model of 2 segment chord. Arc BCD is a part of circle with unity radius. AD is the main chord, arc BCD is bissected at C, draw lines BC, CD, let BC = CD = x and let radius AC = 1.
Apparently,

Let EJ = EF, FK = FJ; extend BE straight to L, and let EL = BE; make BF = BE, so F is inline with AE. Extended BF to M, let BF = MF; connect LM, LM apparently passes point C. The inverted triangle BLM along BM axis into triangle BMN, such that C coincident with G, and point L coincident with point N. The Invert triangle NGB along BN axis into triangle; apparently BI = BC.



BM bisects CG and let BM = BC; join GM, CM; draw CO = CM to intercept BM at O; make MP = MO; make NQ = NR, R is the intersection of BN and AC. ∠EBC = 1/2 ∠CAE = 1/2 ∠EAB; 
 
 
 
  ∠EBM = ∠EAB; thus we otain a series of similar triangles: ABE, BEF, FJK, BLM, CMO, MOP, CGH and triangle CMO = triangle EFJ;3

So

and 
 
 

Because kite-shaped ABEC and BLIN are similar,.4

Let

  then




Square up the above equation on both sides and divide by 16:5








And so on

Add up the following two equations to eliminate

Expansion coefficients of the numerators: 1,1,2,5,14,42,132 ...... (see Figure II Ming Antu original figure bottom line, read from right to left) are none other than the Catalan numbers , Ming Antu is the first person in history to discover the Catalan number.78
Thus :

  is Catalan number. Ming Antu pioneered the use of recursion relations in Chinese mathematics11

Finally he obtained12






In Figure 1 BAE angle = α, BAC angle = 2α

x = BC = sinα
q = BL = 2BE = 4sin (α /2)
BD = 2sin (2α)

Ming Antu obtained 
 
 


That is

Three-segment chord
 As shown in Fig 3,BE is a whole arc chord, BC = CE = DE = a are three arcs of equal portions. Radii AB = AC = AD = AE = 1. Draw lines BC, CD, DE, BD, EC; let BG=EH = BC, Bδ = Eα = BD, then triangle Cαβ = Dδγ; while triagnle Cαβ is similar to triangle BδD.
As such:

Eventually, he obtained

Four-segment chord

Five-segment chord

Ten-segment chord
 From here on, Ming Antu stop building geometrical model, he carried out his computation by pure algebraic manipulation of infinite series.
Apparently ten segments can be considered as a composite 5 segment, with each segment in turn consist of two subsegments.



 
 ,
He computed the third and fifth power of infinite series 
 
 
 
  in the above equation, and obtained:

Hundred-segment chord
  A hundred segment arc's chord can be considered as composite 10 segment-10 subsegments, thus sustutde 
 
 
 
  into 
 
 
 
 , after manipulation with infinite series he obtained:

Thousand-segment chord



 
 ……2223
Ten-thousand-segment chord

When number of segments approaches infinity
After obtained the infinite series for n=2,3,5,10,100,1000,10000 segments, Ming Antu went on to handle the case when n approaches infinity.
y100,y1000 and y10000 can be rewritten as:


 
 ..........


 
 ..............


 
 ..................
He noted that obviously, when n approaches infinity, the denominators 24.000000240000002400，24.000002400000218400*80 approach 24 and 24*80 respectively, and when n -> infinity, na (100a,1000a,1000a)becomes the length of the arc; hence25

 
 .....



Ming Antu then performed an infinite series reversion and expressed the arc in terms of its chord
