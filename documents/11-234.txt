Phosphogluconate dehydratase




Phosphogluconate dehydratase

 In enzymology, a phosphogluconate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

6-phospho-D-gluconate 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phospho-D-gluconate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 6-phospho-D-gluconate, and two products, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phospho-D-gluconate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-phospho-D-gluconate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-6-phospho-D-gluconate-forming). Other names in common use include 6-phosphogluconate dehydratase, 6-phosphogluconic dehydrase, gluconate-6-phosphate dehydratase, gluconate 6-phosphate dehydratase, 6-phosphogluconate dehydrase, and 6-phospho-D-gluconate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in Entnerâ€“Doudoroff pathway.
Structural studies
