   Bounded variation      Bounded variation   In mathematical analysis , a function of bounded variation , also known as a     B  V      B  V    BV    function , is a real -valued function whose total variation is bounded (finite): the graph of a function having this property is well behaved in a precise sense. For a continuous function of a single variable , being of bounded variation means that the distance along the direction of the    y   y   y   -axis , neglecting the contribution of motion along    x   x   x   -axis , traveled by a point moving along the graph has a finite value. For a continuous function of several variables, the meaning of the definition is the same, except for the fact that the continuous path to be considered cannot be the whole graph of the given function (which is a hypersurface in this case), but can be every intersection of the graph itself with a hyperplane (in the case of functions of two variables, a plane ) parallel to a fixed   x   x   x   -axis and to the   y   y   y   -axis.  Functions of bounded variation are precisely those with respect to which one may find Riemann‚ÄìStieltjes integrals of all continuous functions.  Another characterization states that the functions of bounded variation on a closed interval are exactly those   f   f   f   which can be written as a difference    g  ‚àí  h      g  normal-‚àí  h    g‚àíh   , where both   g   g   g   and   h   h   h   are bounded monotone .  In the case of several variables, a function   f   f   f   defined on an open subset    Œ©   normal-Œ©   Œ©   of ‚Ñù n is said to have bounded variation if its distributional derivative is a finite vector  Radon measure .  One of the most important aspects of functions of bounded variation is that they form an algebra of discontinuous functions whose first derivative exists almost everywhere : due to this fact, they can and frequently are used to define generalized solutions of nonlinear problems involving functionals , ordinary and partial differential equations in mathematics , physics and engineering . Considering the problem of multiplication of distributions or more generally the problem of defining general nonlinear operations on generalized functions , functions of bounded variation are the smallest algebra which has to be embedded in every space of generalized functions preserving the result of multiplication .  History  According to Boris Golubov, BV functions of a single variable were first introduced by Camille Jordan , in the paper  dealing with the convergence of Fourier series . The first successful step in the generalization of this concept to functions of several variables was due to Leonida Tonelli , 1 who introduced a class of continuous  BV functions in 1926 , to extend his direct method for finding solutions to problems in the calculus of variations in more than one variable. Ten years after, in , Lamberto Cesari  changed the continuity requirement in Tonelli's definition to a less restrictive integrability requirement , obtaining for the first time the class of functions of bounded variation of several variables in its full generality: as Jordan did before him, he applied the concept to resolve of a problem concerning the convergence of Fourier series , but for functions of two variables . After him, several authors applied BV functions to study Fourier series in several variables, geometric measure theory , calculus of variations , and mathematical physics . Renato Caccioppoli and Ennio de Giorgi used them to define measure of nonsmooth  boundaries of sets (see the entry " Caccioppoli set " for further information). Olga Arsenievna Oleinik introduced her view of generalized solutions for nonlinear  partial differential equations as functions from the space BV in the paper , and was able to construct a generalized solution of bounded variation of a first order partial differential equation in the paper : few years later, Edward D. Conway and Joel A. Smoller applied BV -functions to the study of a single nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation of first order in the paper , proving that the solution of the Cauchy problem for such equations is a function of bounded variation, provided the initial value belongs to the same class. Aizik Isaakovich Vol'pert developed extensively a calculus for BV functions: in the paper  he proved the chain rule for BV functions and in the book  he, jointly with his pupil Sergei Ivanovich Hudjaev , explored extensively the properties of BV functions and their application. His chain rule formula was later extended by Luigi Ambrosio and Gianni Dal Maso in the paper .  Formal definition  BV functions of one variable  1|Definition 1.1. The total variation 2 of a real -valued (or more generally complex -valued) function  f , defined on an interval [ a , b ]‚äÇ‚Ñù is the quantity         V  a  b    (  f  )    =    sup   P  ‚àà  ùí´      ‚àë   i  =  0     n  P   -  1     |    f   (   x   i  +  1    )    -   f   (   x  i   )     |      .         superscript   subscript  V  a   b   f     subscript  supremum    P  ùí´      superscript   subscript     i  0       subscript  n  P   1          f   subscript  x    i  1       f   subscript  x  i          V_{a}^{b}(f)=\sup_{P\in\mathcal{P}}\sum_{i=0}^{n_{P}-1}|f(x_{i+1})-f(x_{i})|.\,     where the supremum is taken over the set    ùí´  =   {   P  =   {   x  0   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   x   n  P    }    |   P  is a partition of   [  a  ,  b  ]    }       ùí´   conditional-set    P    subscript  x  0   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  x   subscript  n  P        P  is a partition of   a  b       \scriptstyle\mathcal{P}=\left\{P=\{x_{0},\dots,x_{n_{P}}\}|P\text{ is a %
 partition of }[a,b]\right\}   of all partitions of the interval considered.  If f is differentiable and its derivative is Riemann-integrable, its total variation is the vertical component of the arc-length of its graph, that is to say,         V  a  b    (  f  )    =    ‚à´  a  b     |    f  ‚Ä≤    (  x  )    |   d  x     .         superscript   subscript  V  a   b   f     superscript   subscript   a   b          superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤   x    normal-d  x      V_{a}^{b}(f)=\int_{a}^{b}|f^{\prime}(x)|\,\mathrm{d}x.    2|Definition 1.2. A real-valued function   f   f   f   on the real line is said to be of bounded variation ( BV function ) on a chosen interval [ a , b ]‚äÇ‚Ñù if its total variation is finite, i.e.       f  ‚àà   B  V   (   [  a  ,  b  ]   )     ‚áî     V  a  b    (  f  )    <   +  ‚àû       iff    f    B  V   a  b          superscript   subscript  V  a   b   f          f\in BV([a,b])\iff V_{a}^{b}(f)<+\infty     It can be proved that a real function ∆í is of bounded variation in an interval if and only if it can be written as the difference ∆í = ∆í 1 ‚àí ∆í 2 of two non-decreasing functions: this result is known as the Jordan decomposition of a function and it is related to the Jordan decomposition of a measure .  Through the Stieltjes integral , any function of bounded variation on a closed interval [ a , b ] defines a bounded linear functional on C ([ a , b ]). In this special case, 3 the Riesz representation theorem states that every bounded linear functional arises uniquely in this way. The normalised positive functionals or probability measures correspond to positive non-decreasing lower semicontinuous functions . This point of view has been important in spectral theory , 4 in particular in its application to ordinary differential equations .  BV functions of several variables  Functions of bounded variation, BV functions , are functions whose distributional derivative is a finite 5  Radon measure . More precisely:  3|Definition 2.1.

An equivalent definition is the following.  4|Definition 2.2.

Sometimes, especially in the theory of Caccioppoli sets , the following notation is used        ‚à´  Œ©    |   D  u   |    =   V   (  u  ,  Œ©  )          subscript   normal-Œ©       D  u       V   u  normal-Œ©      \int_{\Omega}|Du|=V(u,\Omega)     in order to emphasize that    V   (  u  ,  Œ©  )       V   u  normal-Œ©     V(u,\Omega)   is the total variation of the distributional / weak  gradient of    u   u   u    . This notation reminds also that if    u   u   u    is of class     C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}    (i.e. a continuous and differentiable function having continuous  derivatives ) then its variation is exactly the integral of the absolute value of its gradient .  The space of functions of bounded variation ( BV functions ) can then be defined as       B  V   (  Œ©  )    =   {   u  ‚àà    L  1    (  Œ©  )     :    V   (  u  ,  Œ©  )    <   +  ‚àû    }         B  V  normal-Œ©    conditional-set    u     superscript  L  1   normal-Œ©        V   u  normal-Œ©            BV(\Omega)=\{u\in L^{1}(\Omega)\colon V(u,\Omega)<+\infty\}     The two definitions are equivalent since if     V   (  u  ,  Œ©  )    <   +  ‚àû         V   u  normal-Œ©          \scriptstyle V(u,\Omega)<+\infty   then        |    ‚à´  Œ©    u   (  x  )   div  œï   (  x  )   d  x    |   ‚â§   V   (  u  ,  Œ©  )     ‚à•  œï  ‚à•     L  ‚àû    (  Œ©  )         ‚àÄ  œï   ‚àà    C  c  1    (  Œ©  ,   ‚Ñù  n   )        formulae-sequence        subscript   normal-Œ©     u  x  div  bold-italic-œï  x  normal-d  x       V   u  normal-Œ©    subscript   norm  bold-italic-œï      superscript  L    normal-Œ©         for-all  bold-italic-œï      superscript   subscript  C  c   1    normal-Œ©   superscript  ‚Ñù  n        \left|\int_{\Omega}u(x)\,\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}x\right|%

Hence the continuous linear functional defines a Radon measure by the Riesz-Markov Theorem .  Locally BV functions  If the function space of locally integrable functions , i.e. functions belonging to     L   l  o  c   1    (  Œ©  )        subscript   superscript  L  1     l  o  c    normal-Œ©    \scriptstyle L^{1}_{loc}(\Omega)   , is considered in the preceding definitions ,  and  instead of the one of globally integrable functions , then the function space defined is that of functions of locally bounded variation . Precisely, developing this idea for , a local variation is defined as follows,       V   (  u  ,  U  )    :=   sup   {    ‚à´  Œ©    u   (  x  )   div  œï   (  x  )   d  x    :    œï  ‚àà    C  c  1    (  U  ,   ‚Ñù  n   )     ,     ‚à•  œï  ‚à•     L  ‚àû    (  Œ©  )     ‚â§  1    }       assign    V   u  U     supremum   conditional-set    subscript   normal-Œ©     u  x  div  bold-italic-œï  x  normal-d  x     formulae-sequence    bold-italic-œï     superscript   subscript  C  c   1    U   superscript  ‚Ñù  n         subscript   norm  bold-italic-œï      superscript  L    normal-Œ©    1        V(u,U):=\sup\left\{\int_{\Omega}u(x)\mathrm{div}\boldsymbol{\phi}(x)\mathrm{d}%

To see that     B  V   (  Œ©  )       B  V  normal-Œ©    BV(\Omega)    is complete respect to it, i.e. it is a Banach space , consider a Cauchy sequence      {   u  n   }    n  ‚àà  ‚Ñï      subscript    subscript  u  n      n  ‚Ñï     \scriptstyle\{u_{n}\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}   in     B  V   (  Œ©  )       B  V  normal-Œ©    BV(\Omega)    . By definition it is also a Cauchy sequence in      L  1    (  Œ©  )        superscript  L  1   normal-Œ©    L^{1}(\Omega)    and therefore has a limit     u   u   u    in      L  1    (  Œ©  )        superscript  L  1   normal-Œ©    L^{1}(\Omega)    : since     u  n     subscript  u  n    u_{n}    is bounded in     B  V   (  Œ©  )       B  V  normal-Œ©    BV(\Omega)    for each    n   n   n    , then      ‚à•  u  ‚à•    B  V    <   +  ‚àû        subscript   norm  u     B  V          \scriptstyle\|u\|_{BV}<+\infty   by lower semicontinuity of the variation    V   (  ‚ãÖ  ,  Œ©  )       V   normal-‚ãÖ  normal-Œ©     \scriptstyle V(\cdot,\Omega)   , therefore    u   u   u    is a BV function. Finally, again by lower semicontinuity, choosing an arbitrary small positive number    Œµ   Œµ   \scriptstyle\varepsilon             ‚à•    u  j   -   u  k    ‚à•    B  V    <   Œµ   ‚àÄ  j     ,   k  ‚â•  N  ‚àà  ‚Ñï      ‚áí   V   (    u  k   -  u   ,  Œ©  )     ‚â§    lim inf   j  ‚Üí   +  ‚àû      V   (    u  k   -   u  j    ,  Œ©  )     ‚â§  Œµ      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence     subscript   norm     subscript  u  j    subscript  u  k       B  V     Œµ   for-all  j         k  N       ‚Ñï          normal-‚áí    V      subscript  u  k   u   normal-Œ©       subscript  limit-infimum   normal-‚Üí  j          V      subscript  u  k    subscript  u  j    normal-Œ©          Œµ      \|u_{j}-u_{k}\|_{BV}<\varepsilon\quad\forall j,k\geq N\in\mathbb{N}\quad%
 \Rightarrow\quad V(u_{k}-u,\Omega)\leq\liminf_{j\rightarrow+\infty}V(u_{k}-u_{%
 j},\Omega)\leq\varepsilon     BV (Œ©) is not separable  To see this, it is sufficient to consider the following example belonging to the space     B  V   (   [  0  ,  1  ]   )       B  V   0  1     BV([0,1])    : 7 for each 0\chi_\alpha=\chi_{[\alpha,1]}= \begin{cases} 0 & \mbox{if } x \notin\; [\alpha,1] \\  1¬†&¬†\mbox{if¬†}¬†x¬†\in¬†[\alpha,1]  \end{cases}  as the characteristic function of the left-closed interval     [  Œ±  ,  1  ]     Œ±  1    [\alpha,1]   . Then, choosing Œ±,Œ≤ ‚àà    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   such that Œ± ‚â† Œ≤ the following relation holds true:        ‚à•    œá  Œ±   -   œá  Œ≤    ‚à•    B  V    =   2  +   |   Œ±  -  Œ≤   |         subscript   norm     subscript  œá  Œ±    subscript  œá  Œ≤       B  V      2      Œ±  Œ≤       \|\chi_{\alpha}-\chi_{\beta}\|_{BV}=2+|\alpha-\beta|   Now, in order to prove that every dense subset of     B  V   (  ]   0  ,  1   [  )      fragments  B  V   fragments  normal-(  normal-]   0  normal-,  1   fragments  normal-[  normal-)     BV(]0,1[)    cannot be countable , it is sufficient to see that for every Œ± ‚àà    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   it is possible to construct the balls       B  Œ±   =   {  œà  ‚àà  B  V   (   [  0  ,  1  ]   )   ;  ‚à•   œá  Œ±   -  œà   ‚à•   B  V    ‚â§  1  }      fragments   subscript  B  Œ±     fragments  normal-{  œà   B  V   fragments  normal-(   fragments  normal-[  0  normal-,  1  normal-]   normal-)   normal-;  parallel-to   subscript  œá  Œ±    œà   subscript  parallel-to    B  V     1  normal-}     B_{\alpha}=\left\{\psi\in BV([0,1]);\|\chi_{\alpha}-\psi\|_{BV}\leq 1\right\}   Obviously those balls are pairwise disjoint , and also are an indexed family of sets whose index set is    [  0  ,  1  ]     0  1    [0,1]   . This implies that this family has the cardinality of the continuum : now, since any dense subset of     B  V   (   [  0  ,  1  ]   )       B  V   0  1     BV([0,1])    must have at least a point inside each member of this family, its cardinality is at least that of the continuum and therefore cannot a be countable subset. 8 This example can be obviously extended to higher dimensions, and since it involves only local properties , it implies that the same property is true also for     B   V   l  o  c        B   subscript  V    l  o  c      BV_{loc}    .  Chain rule for BV functions  Chain rules for nonsmooth functions are very important in mathematics and mathematical physics since there are several important physical models whose behavior is described by functions or functionals with a very limited degree of smoothness .The following version is proved in the paper : all partial derivatives must be intended in a generalized sense. i.e. as generalized derivatives  Theorem .

However, even this formula has very important direct consequences: choosing     f   (  u  )    =   v   (  ùíô  )   u   (  ùíô  )          f  u     v  ùíô  u  ùíô     \scriptstyle f(u)=v(\boldsymbol{x})u(\boldsymbol{x})   , where    v   (  ùíô  )       v  ùíô    \scriptstyle v(\boldsymbol{x})   is also a     B  V      B  V    BV    function, the preceding formula gives the Leibniz rule for     B  V      B  V    BV    functions         ‚àÇ  v    (  ùíô  )   u   (  ùíô  )     ‚àÇ   x  i     =     u  ¬Ø    (  ùíô  )      ‚àÇ  v    (  ùíô  )     ‚àÇ   x  i      +    v  ¬Ø    (  ùíô  )      ‚àÇ  u    (  ùíô  )     ‚àÇ   x  i                 v   ùíô  u  ùíô      subscript  x  i          normal-¬Ø  u   ùíô        v   ùíô      subscript  x  i         normal-¬Ø  v   ùíô        u   ùíô      subscript  x  i         \frac{\partial v(\boldsymbol{x})u(\boldsymbol{x})}{\partial x_{i}}={\bar{u}(%

BV (Œ©) is a Banach algebra  This property follows directly from the fact that     B  V   (  Œ©  )       B  V  normal-Œ©    BV(\Omega)    is a Banach space and also an associative algebra : this implies that if     {   v  n   }      subscript  v  n     \{v_{n}\}    and     {   u  n   }      subscript  u  n     \{u_{n}\}    are Cauchy sequences of    B  V      B  V    BV   functions converging respectively to functions     v   v   v    and    u   u   u    in     B  V   (  Œ©  )       B  V  normal-Œ©    BV(\Omega)    , then    \begin{matrix}     vu_n\xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{}¬†vu¬†\\  v_nu\xrightarrow[n\to\infty]{}¬†vu  \end{matrix}\quad\Longleftrightarrow  \quad vu\in BV(\Omega)  therefore the ordinary product of functions is continuous in     B  V   (  Œ©  )       B  V  normal-Œ©    BV(\Omega)    respect to each argument, making this function space a Banach algebra .  Generalizations and extensions  Weighted BV functions  It is possible to generalize the above notion of total variation so that different variations are weighted differently. More precisely, let    œÜ  :    [  0  ,   +  ‚àû   )   ‚ü∂   [  0  ,   +  ‚àû   )       normal-:  œÜ   normal-‚ü∂   0        0          \scriptstyle\varphi:[0,+\infty)\longrightarrow[0,+\infty)   be any increasing function such that     œÜ   (  0  )    =   œÜ   (   0  +   )    =    lim   x  ‚Üí   0  +      œÜ   (  x  )     =  0          œÜ  0     œÜ   limit-from  0            subscript    normal-‚Üí  x   subscript  0        œÜ  x         0     \scriptstyle\varphi(0)=\varphi(0+)=\lim_{x\rightarrow 0_{+}}\varphi(x)=0   (the weight function ) and let    f  :    [  0  ,  T  ]   ‚ü∂  X      normal-:  f   normal-‚ü∂   0  T   X     \scriptstyle f:[0,T]\longrightarrow X   be a function from the interval     [  0  ,  T  ]     0  T    [0,T]   ‚äÇ‚Ñù taking values in a normed vector space    X   X   X   . Then the   ùùã   ùùã   \scriptstyle\boldsymbol{\varphi}    -variation of   f   f   f   over    [  0  ,  T  ]     0  T    [0,T]   is defined as          œÜ  -Var    [  0  ,  T  ]     (  f  )    :=   sup    ‚àë   j  =  0   k    œÜ   (    |    f   (   t   j  +  1    )    -   f   (   t  j   )     |   X   )       ,     assign    subscript    œÜ  -Var    0  T    f    supremum    superscript   subscript     j  0    k     œÜ   subscript        f   subscript  t    j  1       f   subscript  t  j      X        \mathop{\varphi\mbox{-Var}}_{[0,T]}(f):=\sup\sum_{j=0}^{k}\varphi\left(|f(t_{j%
 +1})-f(t_{j})|_{X}\right),     where, as usual, the supremum is taken over all finite partitions of the interval    [  0  ,  T  ]     0  T    [0,T]   , i.e. all the finite sets of real numbers     t  i     subscript  t  i    t_{i}   such that       0  =   t  0   <   t  1   <  ‚Ä¶  <   t  k   =  T   .        0   subscript  t  0         subscript  t  1        normal-‚Ä¶        subscript  t  k        T     0=t_{0}     The original notion of variation considered above is the special case of   œÜ   œÜ   \scriptstyle\varphi   -variation for which the weight function is the identity function : therefore an integrable function    f   f   f   is said to be a weighted BV function (of weight   œÜ   œÜ   \scriptstyle\varphi   ) if and only if its   œÜ   œÜ   \scriptstyle\varphi   -variation is finite.       f  ‚àà   B   V  œÜ    (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;  X  )     ‚áî      œÜ  -Var    [  0  ,  T  ]     (  f  )    <   +  ‚àû       iff    f    B   subscript  V  œÜ     0  T   X         subscript    œÜ  -Var    0  T    f          f\in BV_{\varphi}([0,T];X)\iff\mathop{\varphi\mbox{-Var}}_{[0,T]}(f)<+\infty     The space    B   V  œÜ    (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;  X  )       B   subscript  V  œÜ     0  T   X     \scriptstyle BV_{\varphi}([0,T];X)   is a topological vector space with respect to the norm         ‚à•  f  ‚à•    B   V  œÜ     :=     ‚à•  f  ‚à•   ‚àû   +     œÜ  -Var    [  0  ,  T  ]     (  f  )      ,     assign   subscript   norm  f     B   subscript  V  œÜ        subscript   norm  f       subscript    œÜ  -Var    0  T    f      \|f\|_{BV_{\varphi}}:=\|f\|_{\infty}+\mathop{\varphi\mbox{-Var}}_{[0,T]}(f),     where     ‚à•  f  ‚à•   ‚àû     subscript   norm  f      \scriptstyle\|f\|_{\infty}   denotes the usual supremum norm of    f   f   f    . Weighted BV functions were introduced and studied in full generality by W≈Çadys≈Çaw Orlicz and Julian Musielak in the paper : Laurence Chisholm Young studied earlier the case     œÜ   (  x  )    =   x  p         œÜ  x    superscript  x  p     \scriptstyle\varphi(x)=x^{p}   where    p   p   p    is a positive integer.  SBV functions  SBV functions  i.e.  Special functions of Bounded Variation were introduced by Luigi Ambrosio and Ennio de Giorgi in the paper , dealing with free discontinuity variational problems : given an open subset     Œ©   normal-Œ©   \Omega    of ‚Ñù n , the space     S  B  V   (  Œ©  )       S  B  V  normal-Œ©    SBV(\Omega)    is a proper linear subspace of     B  V   (  Œ©  )       B  V  normal-Œ©    BV(\Omega)    , since the weak  gradient of each function belonging to it consists precisely of the sum of an   n   n   n   - dimensional  support and an    n  -  1      n  1    n-1   - dimensional  support  measure and no intermediate-dimensional terms , as seen in the following definition.  Definition . Given a locally integrable function     u   u   u    , then    u  ‚àà    S   B  V   (  Œ©  )        u    S  B  V  normal-Œ©     \scriptstyle u\in{S\!BV}(\Omega)   if and only if  1. There exist two Borel functions    f   f   f   and   g   g   g   of domain     Œ©   normal-Œ©   \Omega    and codomain ‚Ñù n such that          ‚à´  Œ©     |  f  |   d   H  n     +    ‚à´  Œ©     |  g  |   d   H   n  -  1       <   +  ‚àû    .          subscript   normal-Œ©       f   d   superscript  H  n       subscript   normal-Œ©       g   d   superscript  H    n  1             \int_{\Omega}|f|dH^{n}+\int_{\Omega}|g|dH^{n-1}<+\infty.     2.

Details on the properties of SBV functions can be found in works cited in the bibliography section: particularly the paper  contains a useful bibliography .  bv sequences  As particular examples of Banach spaces ,  consider spaces of sequences of bounded variation , in addition to the spaces of functions of bounded variation. The total variation of a sequence  x =( x i ) of real or complex numbers is defined by        T  V   (  x  )    =    ‚àë   i  =  1   ‚àû    |    x   i  +  1    -   x  i    |     .        T  V  x     superscript   subscript     i  1           subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x  i        TV(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|x_{i+1}-x_{i}|.     The space of all sequences of finite total variation is denoted by bv . The norm on bv is given by         ‚à•  x  ‚à•    b  v    =    |   x  1   |   +   T  V   (  x  )     =    |   x  1   |   +    ‚àë   i  =  1   ‚àû    |    x   i  +  1    -   x  i    |      .         subscript   norm  x     b  v         subscript  x  1      T  V  x              subscript  x  1      superscript   subscript     i  1           subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x  i          \|x\|_{bv}=|x_{1}|+TV(x)=|x_{1}|+\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|x_{i+1}-x_{i}|.   With this norm, the space bv is a Banach space.  The total variation itself defines a norm on a certain subspace of bv , denoted by bv 0 , consisting of sequences x = ( x i ) for which        lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû     x  n    =  0.        subscript    normal-‚Üí  n      subscript  x  n    0.    \lim_{n\to\infty}x_{n}=0.   The norm on bv 0 is denoted         ‚à•  x  ‚à•    b   v  0     =   T  V   (  x  )    =    ‚àë   i  =  1   ‚àû    |    x   i  +  1    -   x  i    |     .         subscript   norm  x     b   subscript  v  0       T  V  x          superscript   subscript     i  1           subscript  x    i  1     subscript  x  i         \|x\|_{bv_{0}}=TV(x)=\sum_{i=1}^{\infty}|x_{i+1}-x_{i}|.   With respect to this norm bv 0 becomes a Banach space as well.  Measures of bounded variation  A signed (or complex ) measure     Œº   Œº   \mu    on a measurable space     (  X  ,  Œ£  )     X  normal-Œ£    (X,\Sigma)   is said to be of bounded variation if its total variation ''     ‚à•  Œº  ‚à•   =    |  Œº  |    (  X  )         norm  Œº       Œº   X     \scriptstyle\|\mu\|=|\mu|(X)   '' is bounded: see ,  or the entry " Total variation " for further details.

At the same time, the function       f   (  x  )    =   {      0  ,       if  x   =  0          x  2    sin   (   1  /  x   )     ,       if  x   ‚â†  0             f  x    cases  0      if  x   0      superscript  x  2       1  x         if  x   0      f(x)=\begin{cases}0,&\mbox{if }x=0\\
 x^{2}\sin(1/x),&\mbox{if }x\neq 0\end{cases}     is of bounded variation on the interval    [  0  ,   2  /  œÄ   ]     0    2  œÄ     [0,2/\pi]   . However, all three functions are of bounded variation on each interval     [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]    with     a  >  0      a  0    a>0   .

 _{c}^{1}     holds, since it is nothing more than the definition of weak derivative , and hence holds true. One can easily find an example of a BV function which is not     W   1  ,  1      superscript  W   1  1     W^{1,1}    : in dimension one, any step function with a non-trivial jump will do.  Applications  Mathematics  Functions of bounded variation have been studied in connection with the set of discontinuities of functions and differentiability of real functions, and the following results are well-known. If   f   f   f   is a real  function of bounded variation on an interval    [  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    [a,b]   then      f   f   f   is continuous except at most on a countable set ;     f   f   f   has one-sided limits everywhere (limits from the left everywhere in    (  a  ,  b  ]     a  b    (a,b]   , and from the right everywhere in    [  a  ,  b  )     a  b    [a,b)   ;  the derivative      f  ‚Ä≤    (  x  )        superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤   x    f^{\prime}(x)   exists almost everywhere (i.e. except for a set of measure zero ).   For real  functions of several real variables   the characteristic function of a Caccioppoli set is a BV function: BV functions lie at the basis of the modern theory of perimeters.  Minimal surfaces are graphs of BV functions: in this context, see reference .   Physics and engineering  The ability of BV functions to deal with discontinuities has made their use widespread in the applied sciences: solutions of problems in mechanics, physics, chemical kinetics are very often representable by functions of bounded variation. The book  details a very ample set of mathematical physics applications of BV functions. Also there is some modern application which deserves a brief description.   The Mumford-Shah Functional : the segmentation problem for a two-dimensional image, i.e. the problem of faithful reproduction of contours and grey scales is equivalent to the minimization of such functional .
