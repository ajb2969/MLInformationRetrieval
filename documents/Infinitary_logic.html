<h1>Infinitary logic</h1>
<hr/>
<p>An <strong>infinitary logic</strong> is a <a href="Formal_logical_system" title="wikilink">logic</a> that allows infinitely long <a href="statement_(logic)" title="wikilink">statements</a> and/or infinitely long <a href="Mathematical_proof" title="wikilink">proofs</a>. Some infinitary logics may have different properties from those of standard <a href="first-order_logic" title="wikilink">first-order logic</a>. In particular, infinitary logics may fail to be <a href="Compactness_(logic)" title="wikilink">compact</a> or <a href="Completeness_(logic)" title="wikilink">complete</a>. Notions of compactness and completeness that are equivalent in <a href="finitary_logic" title="wikilink">finitary logic</a> sometimes are not so in infinitary logics. Therefore for infinitary logics, notions of strong compactness and strong completeness are defined. This article addresses Hilbert-type infinitary logics, as these have been extensively studied and constitute the most straightforward extensions of finitary logic. These are not, however, the only infinitary logics that have been formulated or studied.</p>
<p>Considering whether a certain infinitary logic named <a class="uri" href="Ω-logic" title="wikilink">Ω-logic</a> is complete promises to throw light on the <a href="continuum_hypothesis" title="wikilink">continuum hypothesis</a>.</p>
<h2 id="a-word-on-notation-and-the-axiom-of-choice">A word on notation and the axiom of choice</h2>
<p>As a language with infinitely long formulae is being presented, it is not possible to write expressions down as they should be written. To get around this problem a number of notational conveniences, which, strictly speaking, are not part of the formal language, are used. <span class="LaTeX">$\cdots$</span> is used to point out an expression that is infinitely long. Where it is unclear, the length of the sequence is noted afterwards. Where this notation becomes ambiguous or confusing, suffixes such as <span class="LaTeX">$\lor_{\gamma < \delta}{A_{\gamma}}$</span> are used to indicate an infinite disjunction over a set of formulae of cardinality <span class="LaTeX">$\delta$</span>. The same notation may be applied to quantifiers for example <span class="LaTeX">$\forall_{\gamma < \delta}{V_{\gamma}:}$</span>. This is meant to represent an infinite sequence of quantifiers for each <span class="LaTeX">$V_{\gamma}$</span> where <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma < \delta$</span>.</p>
<p>All usage of suffixes and <span class="LaTeX">$\cdots$</span> are not part of formal infinitary languages. The axiom of choice is assumed (as is often done when discussing infinitary logic) as this is necessary to have sensible distributivity laws.</p>
<h2 id="definition-of-hilbert-type-infinitary-logics">Definition of Hilbert-type infinitary logics</h2>
<p>A first-order infinitary logic <em>L</em><sub>α,β</sub>, α <a href="regular_cardinal" title="wikilink">regular</a>, β = 0 or ω ≤ β ≤ α, has the same set of symbols as a finitary logic and may use all the rules for formation of formulae of a finitary logic together with some additional ones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a set of variables <span class="LaTeX">$V=\{V_\gamma | \gamma< \delta < \beta \}$</span> and a formula <span class="LaTeX">$A_0$</span> then <span class="LaTeX">$\forall V_0 :\forall V_1 \cdots (A_0)$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\exists V_0 :\exists V_1 \cdots (A_0)$</span> are formulae (In each case the sequence of quantifiers has length <span class="LaTeX">$\delta$</span>).</li>
<li>Given a set of formulae <span class="LaTeX">$A=\{A_\gamma | \gamma < \delta <\alpha \}$</span> then <span class="LaTeX">$(A_0 \lor A_1 \lor \cdots)$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$(A_0 \and A_1 \and \cdots)$</span> are formulae (In each case the sequence has length <span class="LaTeX">$\delta$</span>).</li>
</ul>
<p>The concepts of bound variables apply in the same manner to infinite sentences. Note that the number of brackets in these formulae is always finite. Just as in finitary logic, a formula all of whose variables are bound is referred to as a <em><a href="sentence_(mathematical_logic)" title="wikilink">sentence</a></em>.</p>
<p>A theory T in infinitary logic <span class="LaTeX">$L_{\alpha , \beta}$</span> is a set of statements in the logic. A proof in infinitary logic from a theory T is a sequence of statements of length <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma$</span> which obeys the following conditions: Each statement is either a logical axiom, an element of T, or is deduced from previous statements using a rule of inference. As before, all rules of inference in finitary logic can be used, together with an additional one:</p>
<ul>
<li>Given a set of statements <span class="LaTeX">$A=\{A_\gamma | \gamma < \delta <\alpha \}$</span> which have occurred previously in the proof then the statement <span class="LaTeX">$\and_{\gamma < \delta}{A_{\gamma}}$</span> can be inferred.</li>
</ul>
<p>The logical axiom schemata specific to infinitary logic are presented below. Global schemata variables<span class="LaTeX">$$\delta$$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma$</span> such that <span class="LaTeX">$0 < \delta < \alpha$</span>.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="LaTeX">$((\and_{\epsilon < \delta}{(A_{\delta} \implies A_{\epsilon})}) \implies (A_{\delta} \implies \and_{\epsilon < \delta}{A_{\epsilon}}))$</span></li>
<li>For each <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma < \delta$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$((\and_{\epsilon < \delta}{A_{\epsilon}}) \implies A_{\gamma})$</span></li>
<li>Chang's distributivity laws (for each <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma$</span>)<span class="LaTeX">$$(\lor_{\mu < \gamma}{(\and_{\delta < \gamma}{A_{\mu , \delta}})})$$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$\forall \mu \forall \delta \exists \epsilon < \gamma: A_{\mu , \delta} = A_{\epsilon}$</span> or <span class="LaTeX">$A_{\mu , \delta} = \neg A_{\epsilon}$</span>, and <span class="LaTeX">$\forall g \in \gamma^{\gamma} \exists \epsilon < \gamma: \{A_{\epsilon} , \neg A_{\epsilon}\} \subseteq \{A_{\mu , g(\mu)} : \mu < \gamma\}$</span></li>
<li>For <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma < \alpha$</span>, <span class="LaTeX">$((\and_{\mu < \gamma}{(\lor_{\delta < \gamma}{A_{\mu , \delta}})}) \implies (\lor_{\epsilon < \gamma^{\gamma}}{(\and_{\mu < \gamma}{A_{\mu ,\gamma_{\epsilon}(\mu)})}}))$</span>, where <span class="LaTeX">$\{\gamma_{\epsilon}: \epsilon < \gamma^{\gamma}\}$</span> is a well ordering of <span class="LaTeX">$\gamma^{\gamma}$</span></li>
</ul>
<p>The last two axiom schemata require the axiom of choice because certain sets must be <a href="well_order" title="wikilink">well orderable</a>. The last axiom schema is strictly speaking unnecessary as Chang's distributivity laws imply it, however it is included as a natural way to allow natural weakenings to the logic.</p>
<h2 id="completeness-compactness-and-strong-completeness">Completeness, compactness, and strong completeness</h2>
<p>A theory is any set of statements. The truth of statements in models are defined by recursion and will agree with the definition for finitary logic where both are defined. Given a theory T a statement is said to be valid for the theory T if it is true in all models of T.</p>
<p>A logic <span class="LaTeX">$L_{\alpha , \beta}$</span> is complete if for every sentence S valid in every model there exists a proof of S. It is strongly complete if for any theory T for every sentence S valid in T there is a proof of S from T. An infinitary logic can be complete without being strongly complete.</p>
<p>A cardinal <span class="LaTeX">$\kappa \neq \omega$</span> is <a href="weakly_compact_cardinal" title="wikilink">weakly compact</a> when for every theory T in <span class="LaTeX">$L_{\kappa , \kappa}$</span> containing at most <span class="LaTeX">$\kappa$</span> many formulas, if every S <span class="LaTeX">$\subseteq$</span> T of cardinality less than <span class="LaTeX">$\kappa$</span> has a model, then T has a model. A cardinal <span class="LaTeX">$\kappa \neq \omega$</span> is <a href="strongly_compact_cardinal" title="wikilink">strongly compact</a> when for every theory T in <span class="LaTeX">$L_{\kappa , \kappa}$</span>, without restriction on size, if every S <span class="LaTeX">$\subseteq$</span> T of cardinality less than <span class="LaTeX">$\kappa$</span> has a model, then T has a model.</p>
<h2 id="concepts-expressible-in-infinitary-logic">Concepts expressible in infinitary logic</h2>
<p>In the language of set theory the following statement expresses <a href="Axiom_of_regularity" title="wikilink">foundation</a>:</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$$\forall_{\gamma < \omega}{V_{\gamma}:} \neg \and_{\gamma < \omega}{V_{\gamma +} \in V_{\gamma}}.\,$$</span></p>
<p>Unlike the axiom of foundation, this statement admits no non-standard interpretations. The concept of well foundedness can only be expressed in a logic which allows infinitely many quantifiers in an individual statement. As a consequence many theories, including <a href="Peano_arithmetic" title="wikilink">Peano arithmetic</a>, which cannot be properly axiomatised in finitary logic, can be in a suitable infinitary logic. Other examples include the theories of <a href="non-archimedean_field" title="wikilink">non-archimedean fields</a> and <a href="torsion-free_group" title="wikilink">torsion-free groups</a>. These three theories can be defined without the use of infinite quantification; only infinite junctions are needed.</p>
<h2 id="complete-infinitary-logics">Complete infinitary logics</h2>
<p>Two infinitary logics stand out in their completeness. These are <span class="LaTeX">$L_{\omega , \omega}$</span> and <span class="LaTeX">$L_{\omega_1 , \omega}$</span>. The former is standard finitary first-order logic and the latter is an infinitary logic that only allows statements of countable size.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$L_{\omega , \omega}$</span> is also strongly complete, compact and strongly compact.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$L_{\omega_1, \omega}$</span> fails to be compact, but it is complete (under the axioms given above). Moreover, it satisfies a variant of the <a href="Craig_interpolation" title="wikilink">Craig interpolation</a> property.</p>
<p>If <span class="LaTeX">$L_{\alpha, \alpha}$</span> is strongly complete (under the axioms given above) then <span class="LaTeX">$\alpha$</span> is strongly compact (because proofs in these logics cannot use <span class="LaTeX">$\alpha$</span> or more of the given axioms).</p>
