Biconvex optimization

Biconvex optimization is a generalization of convex optimization where the objective function and the constraint set can be biconvex. There are methods that can find the global optimum of these problems.12
A set 
 
 
 
  is called a biconvex set on 
 
 
 
  if for every fixed 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  is a convex set in 
 
 
 
  and for every fixed 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a convex set in 
 
 
 
 .
A function 
 
 
 
 
  is called a biconvex function if fixing 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is convex over 
 
 
 
  and fixing 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
  is convex over 
 
 
 
 .
A common practice for solving a biconvex problem (which does not guarantee global optimality of the solution) is alternatively updating 
 
 
 
  by fixing one of them and solving the corresponding convex optimization problem.3
