Dagger categories are  categories equipped with an involutive, identity-on-object  contravariant functor called dagger and denoted as 
 
 
 
 . Of special interest are Dagger compact categories (a particular form of dagger categories) elaborated in order to recast  quantum mechanical formalism and quantum information flow in a  category theoretic context (c.f. categorical quantum mechanics and categorical quantum computing).
Below are pages related to this topic at the confluence of quantum mechanics, quantum computing with main focus in category theory.  "
