   Chalcone isomerase      Chalcone isomerase   In enzymology , a chalcone isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   a chalcone   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a flavanone   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , a chalcone , and one product , a flavanone .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically the class of intramolecular lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is flavanone lyase (decyclizing) . This enzyme is also called chalcone-flavanone isomerase . This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis .  The Petunia hybrida (Petunia) genome contains two genes coding for very similar enzymes, ChiA and ChiB, but only the first seems to encode a functional chalcone isomerase.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .  Chalcone isomerase has a core 2-layer alpha/beta structure consisting of beta(3)-alpha(2)-beta-alpha(2)-beta(3). 1  References  Further reading     "  Category:Protein domains  Category:EC 5.5.1  Category:Enzymes of known structure  Category:Chalconoids metabolism  Category:Flavanones metabolism     ↩
