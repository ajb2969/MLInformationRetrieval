   Drag area      Drag area   In mechanics and aerodynamics , the drag area of an object represents the effective size of the object as it is "seen" by the fluid flow around it. The drag area is usually expressed as a product      C  d   A   ,       subscript  C  d   A    C_{d}A,   where   A   A   A   is a representative area of the object, and    C  d     subscript  C  d    C_{d}   is the drag coefficient , which represents what shape it has and how streamlined it is.  The drag coefficient plays a role in Reynold's drag equation ,        F  d   =     1  2     ρ    C  d    A    v  2     .       subscript  F  d       1  2   ρ   subscript  C  d   A   superscript  v  2      F_{d}=\frac{1}{2}\ \rho\ C_{d}A\ v^{2}.   Here,    F  d     subscript  F  d    F_{d}   is the drag force,   ρ   ρ   \rho   the density of the fluid, and   v   v   v   the speed of the object relative to the fluid.
