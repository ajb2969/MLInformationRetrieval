Fundamental matrix (linear differential equation)

In mathematics, a fundamental matrix of a system of n homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations



is a matrix-valued function 
 
 
 
  whose columns are linearly independent solutions of the system. Then the general solution to the system can be written as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 
  ranges over constant vectors (written as column vectors of height n).
One can show that a matrix-valued function 
 
 
 
  is a fundamental matrix of 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is a non-singular matrix for all 
 
 
 
 
 .1
Control theory
The fundamental matrix is used to express the state-transition matrix, an essential component in the solution of a system of linear ordinary differential equations.
