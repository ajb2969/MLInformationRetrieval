   Fundamental matrix (linear differential equation)      Fundamental matrix (linear differential equation)   In mathematics, a fundamental matrix of a system of n homogeneous linear ordinary differential equations        𝐱  ˙    (  t  )    =   A   (  t  )   𝐱   (  t  )           normal-˙  𝐱   t     A  t  𝐱  t     \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)=A(t)\mathbf{x}(t)     is a matrix-valued function    Ψ   (  t  )       normal-Ψ  t    \Psi(t)   whose columns are linearly independent solutions of the system. Then the general solution to the system can be written as    𝐱  =   Ψ   (  t  )   𝐜       𝐱    normal-Ψ  t  𝐜     \mathbf{x}=\Psi(t)\mathbf{c}   , where   𝐜   𝐜   \mathbf{c}   ranges over constant vectors (written as column vectors of height n ).  One can show that a matrix-valued function   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   is a fundamental matrix of      𝐱  ˙    (  t  )    =   A   (  t  )   𝐱   (  t  )           normal-˙  𝐱   t     A  t  𝐱  t     \dot{\mathbf{x}}(t)=A(t)\mathbf{x}(t)   if and only if      Ψ  ˙    (  t  )    =   A   (  t  )   Ψ   (  t  )           normal-˙  normal-Ψ   t     A  t  normal-Ψ  t     \dot{\Psi}(t)=A(t)\Psi(t)   and   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   is a non-singular matrix for all   t   t   t   . 1  Control theory  The fundamental matrix is used to express the state-transition matrix , an essential component in the solution of a system of linear ordinary differential equations.
