   Aldose 1-dehydrogenase      Aldose 1-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , an aldose 1-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-aldose + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-aldonolactone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-aldose and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are D-aldonolactone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-aldose:NAD + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include aldose dehydrogenase , and dehydrogenase, D-aldohexose .
