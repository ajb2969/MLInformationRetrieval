Whitehead's lemma (Lie algebras)

In algebra, Whitehead's lemma on a Lie algebra representation is an important step toward the proof of Weyl's theorem on complete reducibility. Let 
 
 
 
  be a semisimple Lie algebra over a field of characteristic zero, V a finite-dimensional module over it and 
 
 
 
  a linear map such that 
 
 
 
 . The lemma states that there exists a vector v in V such that 
 
 
 
  for all x.
The lemma may be interpreted in terms of Lie algebra cohomology. The proof of the lemma uses a Casimir element.
