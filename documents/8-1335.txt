Milstein method

In mathematics, the Milstein method is a technique for the approximate numerical solution of a stochastic differential equation. It is named after Grigori N. Milstein who first published the method in 1974.12
Description
Consider the autonomous Itō stochastic differential equation



with initial condition X0 = x0, where Wt stands for the Wiener process, and suppose that we wish to solve this SDE on some interval of time [0, T]. Then the Milstein approximation to the true solution X is the Markov chain Y defined as follows:

partition the interval [0, T] into N equal subintervals of width 
 
 
 
 :





set 
 
 



recursively define 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
  by




where 
 
 
 
  denotes the derivative of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
  and



are independent and identically distributed normal random variables with expected value zero and variance

 
 . Then 
 
 
 
  will approximate 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , and increasing 
 
 
 
  will yield a better approximation.
The error of the Milstein method is of order 
 
 
 
 , which is considerably better than the Euler–Maruyama method, whose error is of order 
 
 
 
 .3
Intuitive derivation
For this derivation, we will only look at geometric Brownian motion (GBM), the stochastic differential equation of which is given by



with real constants 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Using Itō's lemma we get


 
  Thus, the solution to the GBM SDE is



where


 
 .
See numerical solution is presented above for three different trajectories.4
