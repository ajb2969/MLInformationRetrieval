   Double beta decay      Double beta decay   Double beta decay is a radioactive decay process where a nucleus releases two beta rays as a single process.  History  The idea of double beta decay was first proposed by Maria Goeppert-Mayer in 1935. 1 In 1937 Ettore Majorana theoretically demonstrated that all results of beta decay theory remain unchanged if the neutrino is its own anti-particle, i.e. a Majorana particle . In 1939 Wendell H. Furry proposed if neutrinos are a Majorana particle, double beta decay can proceed without emission of any neutrino, via the process now called the neutrinoless beta decay. 2  In 1930–40s parity violation in weak interactions was not known and consequently calculations showed that neutrinoless double beta decay should be much more likely to occur than ordinary double beta decay (if neutrinos are Majorana particles). The predicted half-lives were on the order of 10 15–16 years. Efforts to observe the process in laboratory date back to at least 1948 when Edward L. Fireman made the first attempt to measure the half-life of the  isotope. Radiometric experiments through about 1960 produced negative results or false positives, not confirmed by later experiments. In 1950 for the first time the half-life of the  was measured by geochemical methods, to be 1.4     ×    10  2   1       absent     superscript  10  2   1     \times 10^{2}1   years, reasonably close to the modern value. 3  In 1956 after the V-A nature of weak interactions was established it became clear the half-life of neutrinoless double beta decay would significantly exceed that of ordinary double beta decay. Despite significant progress in experimental techniques in 1960–70s, double beta decay was not observed in a laboratory until the 1980s. Experiments had only been able to establish the lower bound for the half-life—about 10 21 years. On the other hand, geochemical experiments detected double beta decay of  and . 4  Double beta decay was first observed in a laboratory in 1987 by the group of Michael Moe at UC Irvine on . Since then many experiments have observed ordinary double beta decay in other isotopes. None of those experiments has produced positive results for the neutrinoless process, raising the half-life lower bound to 10 25 years. Geochemical experiments continued through the 1990s, producing positive results for a few more isotopes. 5 Double beta decay is the rarest known kind of radioactive decay; as of 2012 it has been observed for only 12 isotopes (including double electron capture in  observed in 2001), and all have a mean lifetime over 10 18 yr (table below). 6  Ordinary double beta decay  In double beta decay, two neutrons in the nucleus are converted to protons, and two electrons and two electron antineutrinos are emitted. The process can be thought as a sum of two beta minus decays . In order for (double) beta decay to be possible, the final nucleus must have a larger binding energy than the original nucleus. For some nuclei, such as germanium-76 , the nucleus one atomic number higher has a smaller binding energy, preventing single beta decay. However, the nucleus with atomic number two higher, selenium-76 , has a larger binding energy, so double beta decay is allowed.  For some nuclei, the process occurs as conversion of two protons to neutrons, emitting two electron neutrinos and absorbing two orbital electrons (double electron capture). If the mass difference between the parent and daughter atoms is more than 1.022 MeV/c 2 (two electron masses), another decay is accessible, capture of one orbital electron and emission of one positron . When the mass difference is more than 2.044 MeV/c 2 (four electron masses), emission of two positrons is possible. These theoretical decay branches have not been observed.  Known double beta decay isotopes  There are 35 naturally occurring isotopes capable of double beta decay. The decay can be observed in practice if the single beta decay is forbidden by energy conservation. This happens for even-Z, even-N isotopes, which are more stable due to spin-coupling, seen by the pairing term in the semi-empirical mass formula .  Many isotopes are theoretically expected to double beta decay. In most cases, the double beta decay is so rare its nearly impossible to observe against the background. However, the double beta decay of  (also an alpha emitter) has been measured radiochemically.. Two of the nuclides ( and ) from the table below can also single beta decay but this is extremely suppressed and never been observed.  Eleven isotopes have been experimentally observed undergoing two-neutrino double beta decay. 7 The table below contains nuclides with the latest experimentally measured half-lives, as of December 2012. 8      Nuclide   Half-life, 10 21 years   Transition   Method   Experiment        0.044   ±   plus-or-minus   \pm   ± 0.004    direct   NEMO-3      1.84   ±   plus-or-minus   \pm      ±   plus-or-minus   \pm       direct   GERDA (2013) 9      0.096 ± 0.003 ± 0.010    direct   NEMO-3      0.0235 ± 0.0014 ± 0.0016    direct   NEMO-3      0.00711 ± 0.00002 ± 0.00054    direct   NEMO-3     0.69   ±   plus-or-minus   \pm   ± 0.07   0 + → 0 + 1   direct   Ge coincidence      0.028 ± 0.001 ± 0.003    direct   NEMO-3      7200 ± 400    geochemical       0.7 ± 0.09 ± 0.11    direct   NEMO-3      2.165 ± 0.016 ± 0.059    direct   EXO-200      0.00911   ±   plus-or-minus   \pm   ± 0.00063    direct   NEMO-3      2.0 ± 0.6    geochemical      Note :In the table above where two errors are specified the first one is statistical error and the second is systematic. 10  Neutrinoless double beta decay  (Figure)  Feynman diagram of neutrinoless double beta decay, with two neutrons decaying to two protons. The only emitted products in this process are two electrons, which can occur if the neutrino and antineutrino are the same particle (i.e. Majorana neutrinos) so the same neutrino can be emitted and absorbed within the nucleus. In conventional double beta decay, two antineutrinos — one arising from each W vertex — are emitted from the nucleus, in addition to the two electrons. The detection of neutrinoless double beta decay is thus a sensitive test of whether neutrinos are Majorana particles.   The processes described in the previous section are also known as two-neutrino double beta decay, as two neutrinos (or antineutrinos) are emitted. If the neutrino is a Majorana particle (meaning that the antineutrino and the neutrino are actually the same particle), and at least one type of neutrino has non-zero mass (which has been established by the neutrino oscillation experiments), then it is possible for neutrinoless double beta decay to occur. In the simplest theoretical treatment, light neutrino exchange, the two neutrinos annihilate each other, or equivalently, a nucleon absorbs the neutrino emitted by another nucleon.  The neutrinos in the above diagram are virtual particles . With only two electrons in the final state, the electrons total kinetic energy would be approximately the binding energy difference of the initial and final nuclei (with the nucleus recoil accounting for the rest). To a very good approximation, the electrons are emitted back-to-back.  The decay rate for this process is approximated by      Γ  =  G  |  M   |  2   |   m   β  β     |  2   ,     fragments  Γ   italic-  G  normal-|  M   superscript  normal-|  2   normal-|   subscript  m    β  β     superscript  normal-|  2   normal-,    \Gamma=~{}~{}~{}~{}{G|M|^{2}|m_{\beta\beta}|^{2}},     where   G   G   G   is the two-body phase-space factor,   M   M   M   is the nuclear matrix element, and m ββ is the effective Majorana neutrino mass given by        m   β  β    =    ∑   i  =  1   3     m  i    U   e  i   2      .       subscript  m    β  β      superscript   subscript     i  1    3      subscript  m  i    subscript   superscript  U  2     e  i        m_{\beta\beta}=\sum_{i=1}^{3}m_{i}U^{2}_{ei}.     In this expression, m i is the neutrino masses (of the i th mass eigenstate), and the U ei are elements of the lepton mixing Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata (PMNS) matrix . Therefore, observing neutrinoless double beta decay, in addition to confirming the Majorana neutrino nature, would give information on the absolute neutrino mass scale, potentially the neutrino mass hierarchy, and Majorana phases in the PMNS matrix. 11 12  The deep significance of the process stems from the "black-box theorem" which that observing neutrinoless double beta decay implies at least one neutrino is a Majorana particle , irrespective of whether the process is engendered by neutrino exchange. 13  Experiments  Numerous experiments have searched for neutrinoless double beta decay.

Recent published lower bounds for Ge and Xe indicate no sign of neutrinoless decay.  Heidelberg-Moscow Controversy  Heidelberg-Moscow collaboration initially released limits on neutrinoless beta decay in germanium-76 . 15 Then some members claimed detection in 2001. 16 This claim was criticized by outside physicists 17 18 19 as well as other members of the collaboration. 20 In 2006 a refined estimate by the same authors stated the half-life was 2.3     ×    10  2   5       absent     superscript  10  2   5     \times 10^{2}5   years. 21 More sensitive experiments are expected to resolve the controversy. 22 23  Current Results  As of 2014, GERDA has reached much lower background, obtaining a half-life limit of 2.1     ×    10  2   5       absent     superscript  10  2   5     \times 10^{2}5   years with 21.6 kg*yr exposure. 24 IGEX and HDM data increase the limit to 3     ×    10  2   5       absent     superscript  10  2   5     \times 10^{2}5   yr and rule out detection at high confidence. Searches with 136 Xe, Kamland-Zen and EXO-200, yielded a limit of 2.6     ×    10  2   5       absent     superscript  10  2   5     \times 10^{2}5   yr. Using the latest nuclear matrix elements, the 136 Xe results also disfavor the HM claim.
