Lamé function

In mathematics, a Lamé function (or ellipsoidal harmonic function) is a solution of Lamé's equation, a second-order ordinary differential equation. It was introduced in the paper . Lamé's equation appears in the method of separation of variables applied to the Laplace equation in elliptic coordinates. In some special cases solutions can be expressed in terms of polynomials called Lamé polynomials.
Lamé's equation is


 
  where A and B are constants, and 
 
 
 
  is the Weierstrass elliptic function. The most important case is when B is of the form n(n + 1) for an integer n, in which case the solutions extend to meromorphic functions defined in the whole complex plane. For other values of B the solutions have branch points.
By changing the independent variable, Lamé's equation can also be rewritten in algebraic form as


 
  which after a change of variable becomes a special case of Heun's equation.
