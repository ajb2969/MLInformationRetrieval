   Lamé function      Lamé function   In mathematics, a Lamé function (or ellipsoidal harmonic function ) is a solution of Lamé's equation , a second-order ordinary differential equation . It was introduced in the paper . Lamé's equation appears in the method of separation of variables applied to the Laplace equation in elliptic coordinates . In some special cases solutions can be expressed in terms of polynomials called Lamé polynomials .  Lamé's equation is         d  2   y    d   x  2     =    (   A  +   B   \weierp    (  x  )     )   y            superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  x  2         A    B  \weierp  x    y     \frac{d^{2}y}{dx^{2}}=(A+B\weierp(x))y   where A and B are constants, and   ℘   Weierstrass-p   \wp   is the Weierstrass elliptic function . The most important case is when B is of the form n ( n + 1) for an integer n , in which case the solutions extend to meromorphic functions defined in the whole complex plane. For other values of B the solutions have branch points .  By changing the independent variable, Lamé's equation can also be rewritten in algebraic form as          d  2   y    d   t  2     +    1  2    (    1   t  -   e  1     +   1   t  -   e  2     +   1   t  -   e  3      )     d  y    d  t      =     A  +   B  t     4   (   t  -   e  1    )    (   t  -   e  2    )    (   t  -   e  3    )     y              superscript  d  2   y     d   superscript  t  2         1  2       1    t   subscript  e  1       1    t   subscript  e  2       1    t   subscript  e  3          d  y     d  t            A    B  t      4    t   subscript  e  1      t   subscript  e  2      t   subscript  e  3      y     \frac{d^{2}y}{dt^{2}}+\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{t-e_{1}}+\frac{1}{t-e_{2}}+%
 \frac{1}{t-e_{3}}\right)\frac{dy}{dt}=\frac{A+Bt}{4(t-e_{1})(t-e_{2})(t-e_{3})}y   which after a change of variable becomes a special case of Heun's equation .  References    .   . Available at Gallica .      "  Category:Special functions
