   N-acetyl-beta-alanine deacetylase      N-acetyl-beta-alanine deacetylase   In enzymology , a N-acetyl-beta-alanine deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-acetyl-beta-alanine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   acetate + beta-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acetyl-beta-alanine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are acetate and beta-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acetyl-beta-alanine amidohydrolase . This enzyme participates in beta-alanine metabolism .
