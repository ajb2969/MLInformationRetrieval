   3'-demethylstaurosporine O-methyltransferase      3'-demethylstaurosporine O-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a 3'-demethylstaurosporine O-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + 3'-demethylstaurosporine $\rightleftharpoons$ S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + staurosporine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and 3'-demethylstaurosporine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and staurosporine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:3'-demethylstaurosporine O-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include 3'-demethoxy-3'-hydroxystaurosporine O-methyltransferase , and staurosporine synthase .  References     "  Category:EC 2.1.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
