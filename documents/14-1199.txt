Good cover (algebraic topology)

In mathematics, an open cover of a topological space

 
  is a family of open subsets such that 
 
 
 
  is the union of all of the open sets. In algebraic topology, an open cover is called a good cover if all open sets in the cover and all intersections of finitely many open sets, 
 
 
 
 , are contractible .
The concept was introduced by  on differential manifolds, demanding the 
 
 
 
  to be diffeomorphic to the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Euclidean space

 
 .
Application
A major reason for the notion of a good cover is that the Leray spectral sequence of a fiber bundle degenerates for a good cover, and so the Čech cohomology associated to a good cover is the same as the Čech cohomology of the space. (Such a cover is known as a Leray cover.)
Example
The two-dimensional surface of a sphere 
 
 
 
  has an open cover by two contractible sets, open neighborhoods of opposite hemispheres. However these two sets have an intersection that forms a non-contractible equatorial band. To form a good cover for this surface, one needs at least four open sets. A good cover can be formed by projecting the faces of a tetrahedron onto a sphere in which it is inscribed, and taking an open neighborhood of each face.
