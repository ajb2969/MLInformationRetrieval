   Good cover (algebraic topology)      Good cover (algebraic topology)   In mathematics , an open cover of a topological space    X   X   X   is a family of open subsets such that   X   X   X   is the union of all of the open sets. In algebraic topology , an open cover is called a good cover if all open sets in the cover and all intersections of finitely many open sets,     U    α  1   …   α  n     =    U    α  1   …   α   n  -  1      ∩   U   α  n          subscript  U     subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α  n        subscript  U     subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α    n  1       subscript  U   subscript  α  n       U_{\alpha_{1}\ldots\alpha_{n}}=U_{\alpha_{1}\ldots\alpha_{n-1}}\cap U_{\alpha_%
 {n}}   , are contractible .  The concept was introduced by  on differential manifolds , demanding the    U    α  1   …   α  n       subscript  U     subscript  α  1   normal-…   subscript  α  n      U_{\alpha_{1}\ldots\alpha_{n}}   to be diffeomorphic to the   n   n   n   -dimensional Euclidean space     ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   .  Application  A major reason for the notion of a good cover is that the Leray spectral sequence of a fiber bundle degenerates for a good cover, and so the Čech cohomology associated to a good cover is the same as the Čech cohomology of the space. (Such a cover is known as a Leray cover .)  Example  The two-dimensional surface of a sphere    S  2     superscript  S  2    S^{2}   has an open cover by two contractible sets, open neighborhoods of opposite hemispheres. However these two sets have an intersection that forms a non-contractible equatorial band. To form a good cover for this surface, one needs at least four open sets. A good cover can be formed by projecting the faces of a tetrahedron onto a sphere in which it is inscribed, and taking an open neighborhood of each face.  References    , §5, S. 42.
