Quadratic residuosity problem

The quadratic residuosity problem in computational number theory is to decide, given integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , whether 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue modulo 
 
 
 
  or not. Here 
 
 
 
  for two unknown primes 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  is among the numbers which are not obviously non-quadratic residues (see below).
The problem was first described by Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in 1801. This problem is believed to be computationally difficult. Several cryptographic methods rely on its hardness, see Applications.
An efficient algorithm for the quadratic residuosity problem immediately implies efficient algorithms for other number theoretic problems, such as deciding whether a composite 
 
 
 
  of unknown factorization is the product of 2 or 3 primes .1
Precise formulation
Given integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is said to be a quadratic residue modulo 
 
 
 if there exists an integer 
 
 
 
  such that


 
 .
Otherwise we say it is a quadratic non-residue. When 
 
 
 
  is a prime, it is customary to use the Legendre symbol:



This is a multiplicative character which means 
 
 
 
  for exactly 
 
 
 
  of the values 
 
 
 
 , and it is 
 
 
 
  for the remaining.
It is easy to compute using the law of quadratic reciprocity in a manner akin to the Euclidean algorithm, see Legendre symbol.
Consider now some given 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two, different unknown primes. A given 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue modulo 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue modulo both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Since we don't know 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , we cannot compute 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Perhaps surprisingly, however, we can easily compute their product! This is known as the Jacobi symbol:



This can also be efficiently computed using the law of quadratic reciprocity for Jacobi symbols.
However, 
 
 
 
  can not in all cases tell us whether 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue modulo 
 
 
 
  or not! More precisely, if 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  is necessarily a quadratic non-residue modulo either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 , in which case we are done. But if 
 
 
 
  then it is either the case that 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue modulo both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , or a quadratic non-residue modulo both 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We cannot distinguish these cases from knowing just that 
 
 
 
 .
This leads to the precise formulation of the quadratic residue problem:
Problem: Given integers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are unknown, different primes, and where 
 
 
 
 , determine whether 
 
 
 
  is a quadratic residue modulo 
 
 
 
  or not.
Equal Distribution
If 
 
 
 
  is drawn uniformly at random among those integers from 
 
 
 
  which satisfy 
 
 
 
 , is 
 
 
 
  more often a quadratic residue or a quadratic non-residue modulo 
 
 
 
 ?
As earlier mentioned, for exactly half of the choices of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 , and for the rest we have 
 
 
 
 . By extension, this also holds for half the choices of 
 
 
 
 . Similarly for 
 
 
 
 . Using basic algebra, it is easy to show that this divides 
 
 
 
  into 4 equal parts, depending on the sign of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The allowed 
 
 
 
  in the quadratic residue problem given as above constitute exactly those two parts corresponding to the cases 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Consequently, exactly half of the possible 
 
 
 
  are quadratic residues and the remaining are not.
Applications
The intractability of the quadratic residuosity problem is the basis for the security of the Blum Blum Shub pseudorandom number generator and the Goldwasserâ€“Micali cryptosystem.23
