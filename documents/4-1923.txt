   Quadratic residuosity problem      Quadratic residuosity problem   The quadratic residuosity problem in computational number theory is to decide, given integers   a   a   a   and   N   N   N   , whether   a   a   a   is a quadratic residue modulo   N   N   N   or not. Here    N  =    p  1    p  2        N     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2      N=p_{1}p_{2}   for two unknown primes    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   and    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   , and   a   a   a   is among the numbers which are not obviously non-quadratic residues (see below).  The problem was first described by Gauss in his Disquisitiones Arithmeticae in 1801. This problem is believed to be computationally difficult . Several cryptographic methods rely on its hardness , see Applications .  An efficient algorithm for the quadratic residuosity problem immediately implies efficient algorithms for other number theoretic problems, such as deciding whether a composite   N   N   N   of unknown factorization is the product of 2 or 3 primes . 1  Precise formulation  Given integers   a   a   a   and   T   T   T   ,   a   a   a   is said to be a quadratic residue modulo   T   T   T    if there exists an integer   b   b   b   such that      a  ≡    b  2      (   mod  T   )        a   annotated   superscript  b  2    pmod  T      a\equiv b^{2}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}T)   .  Otherwise we say it is a quadratic non-residue. When    T  =  p      T  p    T=p   is a prime, it is customary to use the Legendre symbol :       (   a  p   )   =   {     1       if  a  is a quadratic residue modulo  p  and  a   ≢   0     (   mod  p   )     ,        -  1       if  a  is a quadratic non-residue modulo  p   ,       0       if  a   ≡   0     (   mod  p   )     .             a  p    cases  1   not-equivalent-to    if  a  is a quadratic residue modulo  p  and  a    annotated  0   pmod  p       1     if  a  is a quadratic non-residue modulo  p   0      if  a    annotated  0   pmod  p        \left(\frac{a}{p}\right)=\begin{cases}1&\text{ if }a\text{ is a quadratic %
 residue modulo }p\text{ and }a\not\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p),\\
 -1&\text{ if }a\text{ is a quadratic non-residue modulo }p,\\
 0&\text{ if }a\equiv 0\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).\end{cases}     This is a multiplicative character which means     (   a  p   )   =  1        a  p   1    \big(\tfrac{a}{p}\big)=1   for exactly     (   p  -  1   )   /  2        p  1   2    (p-1)/2   of the values    1  ,  …  ,   p  -  1      1  normal-…    p  1     1,\ldots,p-1   , and it is    -  1      1    -1   for the remaining.  It is easy to compute using the law of quadratic reciprocity in a manner akin to the Euclidean algorithm , see Legendre symbol .  Consider now some given    N  =    p  1    p  2        N     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2      N=p_{1}p_{2}   where    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   and    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   are two, different unknown primes. A given   a   a   a   is a quadratic residue modulo   N   N   N   if and only if   a   a   a   is a quadratic residue modulo both    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   and    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   .  Since we don't know    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   or    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   , we cannot compute    (   a   p  1    )      a   subscript  p  1     \big(\tfrac{a}{p_{1}}\big)   and    (   a   p  2    )      a   subscript  p  2     \big(\tfrac{a}{p_{2}}\big)   . Perhaps surprisingly, however, we can easily compute their product! This is known as the Jacobi symbol :       (   a  N   )   =    (   a   p  1    )    (   a   p  2    )          a  N       a   subscript  p  1      a   subscript  p  2       \left(\frac{a}{N}\right)=\left(\frac{a}{p_{1}}\right)\left(\frac{a}{p_{2}}\right)     This can also be efficiently computed using the law of quadratic reciprocity for Jacobi symbols.  However,    (   a  N   )      a  N    \big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big)   can not in all cases tell us whether   a   a   a   is a quadratic residue modulo   N   N   N   or not! More precisely, if     (   a  N   )   =   -  1         a  N     1     \big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big)=-1   then   a   a   a   is necessarily a quadratic non-residue modulo either    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   or    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   , in which case we are done. But if     (   a  N   )   =  1        a  N   1    \big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big)=1   then it is either the case that   a   a   a   is a quadratic residue modulo both    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   and    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   , or a quadratic non-residue modulo both    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   and    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   . We cannot distinguish these cases from knowing just that     (   a  N   )   =  1        a  N   1    \big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big)=1   .  This leads to the precise formulation of the quadratic residue problem:  Problem: Given integers   a   a   a   and    N  =    p  1    p  2        N     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2      N=p_{1}p_{2}   , where    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   and    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   are unknown, different primes, and where     (   a  N   )   =  1        a  N   1    \big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big)=1   , determine whether   a   a   a   is a quadratic residue modulo   N   N   N   or not.  Equal Distribution  If   a   a   a   is drawn uniformly at random among those integers from    0  ,  …  ,   N  -  1      0  normal-…    N  1     0,\ldots,N-1   which satisfy     (   a  N   )   =  1        a  N   1    \big(\tfrac{a}{N}\big)=1   , is   a   a   a   more often a quadratic residue or a quadratic non-residue modulo   N   N   N   ?  As earlier mentioned, for exactly half of the choices of    a  ∈   {  1  ,  …  ,    p  1   -  1   }       a   1  normal-…     subscript  p  1   1      a\in\{1,\ldots,p_{1}-1\}   , then     (   a   p  1    )   =  1        a   subscript  p  1    1    \big(\tfrac{a}{p_{1}}\big)=1   , and for the rest we have     (   a   p  1    )   =   -  1         a   subscript  p  1      1     \big(\tfrac{a}{p_{1}}\big)=-1   . By extension, this also holds for half the choices of    a  ∈    {  1  ,  …  ,   N  -  1   }   ∖    p  1   ℤ        a     1  normal-…    N  1       subscript  p  1   ℤ      a\in\{1,\ldots,N-1\}\setminus p_{1}\mathbb{Z}   . Similarly for    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   . Using basic algebra, it is easy to show that this divides     (    ℤ  /  N   ℤ   )   ×     superscript      ℤ  N   ℤ      (\mathbb{Z}/N\mathbb{Z})^{\times}   into 4 equal parts, depending on the sign of    (   a   p  1    )      a   subscript  p  1     \big(\tfrac{a}{p_{1}}\big)   and    (   a   p  2    )      a   subscript  p  2     \big(\tfrac{a}{p_{2}}\big)   .  The allowed   a   a   a   in the quadratic residue problem given as above constitute exactly those two parts corresponding to the cases     (   a   p  1    )   =   (   a   p  1    )   =  1          a   subscript  p  1      a   subscript  p  1         1     \big(\tfrac{a}{p_{1}}\big)=\big(\tfrac{a}{p_{1}}\big)=1   and     (   a   p  1    )   =   (   a   p  1    )   =   -  1           a   subscript  p  1      a   subscript  p  1           1      \big(\tfrac{a}{p_{1}}\big)=\big(\tfrac{a}{p_{1}}\big)=-1   . Consequently, exactly half of the possible   a   a   a   are quadratic residues and the remaining are not.
