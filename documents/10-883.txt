   2'-hydroxydaidzein reductase      2'-hydroxydaidzein reductase   In enzymology , a 2'-hydroxydaidzein reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2'-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrodaidzein + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2'-hydroxydaidzein + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2'-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrodaidzein and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 2'-hydroxydaidzein , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2'-hydroxy-2,3-dihydrodaidzein:NADP+ 2'-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include NADPH:2'-hydroxydaidzein oxidoreductase , HDR , and 2'-hydroxydihydrodaidzein:NADP+ 2'-oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in isoflavonoid biosynthesis .
