Laguerre polynomials

In mathematics, the Laguerre polynomials, named after Edmond Laguerre (1834 - 1886), are solutions of Laguerre's equation:



which is a second-order linear differential equation. This equation has nonsingular solutions only if n is a non-negative integer.
More generally, the name Laguerre polynomials is used for solutions of



Then they are also named generalized Laguerre polynomials, as will be done here (alternatively associated Laguerre polynomials or, rarely, Sonin polynomials, after their inventor1 Nikolay Yakovlevich Sonin).
The Laguerre polynomials are also used for Gaussian quadrature to numerically compute integrals of the form



These polynomials, usually denoted L0, L1, ..., are a polynomial sequence which may be defined by the Rodrigues formula,



reducing to the closed form of a following section.
They are orthogonal polynomials with respect to an inner product



The sequence of Laguerre polynomials  is a Sheffer sequence,



The Rook polynomials in combinatorics are more or less the same as Laguerre polynomials, up to elementary changes of variables. Further see the Tricomi–Carlitz polynomials.
The Laguerre polynomials arise in quantum mechanics, in the radial part of the solution of the Schrödinger equation for a one-electron atom. They also describe the static Wigner functions of oscillator systems in quantum mechanics in phase space. They further enter in the quantum mechanics of the Morse potential and of the 3D isotropic harmonic oscillator.
Physicists sometimes use a definition for the Laguerre polynomials which is larger by a factor of n! than the definition used here. (Likewise, some physicists may use somewhat different definitions of the so-called associated Laguerre polynomials.)

Recursive definition, closed form, and generating function
One can also define the Laguerre polynomials recursively, defining the first two polynomials as






and then using the following recurrence relation for any k ≥ 1:



The closed form is



The generating function for them likewise follows,



Polynomials of negative index can be expressed using the ones with positive index:



Generalized Laguerre polynomials
For arbitrary real α the polynomial solutions of the differential equation 2



are called generalized Laguerre polynomials, or associated Laguerre polynomials.

Explicit examples and properties of the generalized Laguerre polynomials

Laguerre functions are defined by confluent hypergeometric functions and Kummer's transformation as3








When

derived by applying Leibniz's theorem for differentiation of a product to Rodrigues' formula.
 


The first few generalized Laguerre polynomials are:







L_0^{(\alpha)}(x) &= 1 \\ L_1^{(\alpha)}(x) &= -x + \alpha +1 \\ L_2^{(\alpha)}(x) &= \frac{x^2}{2} - (\alpha + 2)x + \frac{(\alpha+2)(\alpha+1)}{2} \\ L_3^{(\alpha)}(x) &= \frac{-x^3}{6} + \frac{(\alpha+3)x^2}{2} -\frac{(\alpha+2)(\alpha+3)x}{2} +\frac{(\alpha+1)(\alpha+2)(\alpha+3)}{6} \end{align}

The coefficient of the leading term is (−1)n/n!;
The constant term, which is the value at 0, is

 ) of the formula above: for integer 
 
 
 
  the generalized polynomial may be written

  This is evident from the contour integral representation below.
The generalized Laguerre polynomials obey the differential equation

Relation to Hermite polynomials
The generalized Laguerre polynomials are related to the Hermite polynomials:



where the Hn(x) are the Hermite polynomials based on the weighting function exp(−x2), the so-called "physicist's version."
Because of this, the generalized Laguerre polynomials arise in the treatment of the quantum harmonic oscillator.
Relation to hypergeometric functions
The Laguerre polynomials may be defined in terms of hypergeometric functions, specifically the confluent hypergeometric functions, as
