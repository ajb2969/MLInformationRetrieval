Tritrans,polycis-undecaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (geranylgeranyl-diphosphate specific)

Tritrans,polycis-undecaprenyl-diphosphate synthase (geranylgeranyl-diphosphate specific) () is an enzyme with system name geranylgeranyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate cistransferase (adding 7 isopentenyl units).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

geranylgeranyl diphosphate + 7 isopentenyl diphosphate

 
  7 diphosphate + tritrans,heptacis-undecaprenyl diphosphate
 

This enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of the glycosyl carrier lipid in some archaebacteria.
