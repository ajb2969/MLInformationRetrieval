Homogeneous tree

In descriptive set theory, a tree over a product set 
 
 
 
  is said to be homogeneous if there is a system of measures

 
  such that the following conditions hold:



 
  is a countably-additive measure on 
 
 
 
  .
The measures are in some sense compatible under restriction of sequences: if 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is in the projection of 
 
 
 
 , the ultrapower by 
 
 
 
  is wellfounded.

An equivalent definition is produced when the final condition is replaced with the following:

There are 
 
 
 
  such that if 
 
 
 
  is in the projection of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then there is 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . This condition can be thought of as a sort of countable completeness condition on the system of measures.



 
  is said to be 

 
 -homogeneous if each 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 -complete.
Homogeneous trees are involved in Martin and Steel's proof of projective determinacy.
