   Homogeneous tree      Homogeneous tree   In descriptive set theory , a tree over a product set    Y  ×  Z      Y  Z    Y\times Z   is said to be homogeneous if there is a system of measures     ⟨   μ  s   ∣   s  ∈   Y      <  ω     ⟩     inner-product   subscript  μ  s     s   superscript  Y    absent  ω       \langle\mu_{s}\mid s\in{}^{<\omega}Y\rangle   such that the following conditions hold:       μ  s     subscript  μ  s    \mu_{s}   is a countably-additive measure on    {  t  ∣    ⟨  s  ,  t  ⟩   ∈  T   }     conditional-set  t     s  t   T     \{t\mid\langle s,t\rangle\in T\}   .  The measures are in some sense compatible under restriction of sequences: if     s  1   ⊆   s  2        subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2     s_{1}\subseteq s_{2}   , then       μ   s  1     (  X  )    =  1   ⇔     μ   s  2     (   {  t  ∣   t  ↾   l  h   (   s  1   )    ∈  X   }   )    =  1      iff       subscript  μ   subscript  s  1    X   1        subscript  μ   subscript  s  2     conditional-set  t     normal-↾  t    l  h   subscript  s  1         X      1     \mu_{s_{1}}(X)=1\iff\mu_{s_{2}}(\{t\mid t\upharpoonright lh(s_{1})\in X\})=1   .  If   x   x   x   is in the projection of   T   T   T   , the ultrapower by    ⟨   μ   x  ↾  n    ∣   n  ∈  ω   ⟩     inner-product   subscript  μ   normal-↾  x  n      n  ω     \langle\mu_{x\upharpoonright n}\mid n\in\omega\rangle   is wellfounded.   An equivalent definition is produced when the final condition is replaced with the following:   There are    ⟨   μ  s   ∣   s  ∈   Y    ω    ⟩     inner-product   subscript  μ  s     s   superscript  Y  ω      \langle\mu_{s}\mid s\in{}^{\omega}Y\rangle   such that if   x   x   x   is in the projection of    [  T  ]     delimited-[]  T    [T]   and     ∀  n   ∈    ω    μ   x  ↾  n     (   X  n   )    =  1         for-all  n     ω   subscript  μ   normal-↾  x  n     subscript  X  n         1     \forall n\in\omega\,\mu_{x\upharpoonright n}(X_{n})=1   , then there is    f  ∈   Z    ω       f   superscript  Z  ω     f\in{}^{\omega}Z   such that     ∀  n   ∈    ω   f   ↾  n  ∈   X  n          for-all  n     ω  f     normal-↾    n        subscript  X  n      \forall n\in\omega\,f\upharpoonright n\in X_{n}   . This condition can be thought of as a sort of countable completeness condition on the system of measures.      T   T   T   is said to be    κ   κ   \kappa   -homogeneous if each    μ  s     subscript  μ  s    \mu_{s}   is   κ   κ   \kappa   -complete.  Homogeneous trees are involved in Martin and Steel 's proof of projective determinacy .  References     "  Category:Descriptive set theory  Category:Determinacy
