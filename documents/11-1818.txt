   Wallman compactification      Wallman compactification   In mathematics, the Wallman compactification is a compactification of T 1 topological spaces that was constructed by .  Definition  The points of the Wallman compactification ω X of a space X are the maximal proper filters in the poset of closed subsets of X . Explicitly, a point of ω X is a family   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   of closed nonempty subsets of X such that   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   is closed under finite intersections, and is maximal among those families that have these properties. For every closed subset F of X , the class Φ F of points of ω X containing F is closed in ω X . The topology of ω X is generated by these closed classes.  Equivalent formulations  For normal spaces , the Wallman compactification is essentially the same as the Stone–Čech compactification .
