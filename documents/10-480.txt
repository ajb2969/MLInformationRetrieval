   Coniferyl-alcohol dehydrogenase      Coniferyl-alcohol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a coniferyl-alcohol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   coniferyl alcohol + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   coniferyl aldehyde + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are coniferyl alcohol and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are coniferyl aldehyde , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is coniferyl-alcohol:NADP + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called CAD .
