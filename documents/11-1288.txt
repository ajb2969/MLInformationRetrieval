   Indolylacetylinositol arabinosyltransferase      Indolylacetylinositol arabinosyltransferase   In enzymology , an indolylacetylinositol arabinosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-L-arabinose + (indol-3-yl)acetyl-1D-myo-inositol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + (indol-3-yl)acetyl-myo-inositol 3-L-arabinoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-L-arabinose and indol-3-ylacetyl-1D-myo-inositol , whereas its two products are UDP and (indol-3-yl)acetyl-myo-inositol 3-L-arabinoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-L-arabinose:(indol-3-yl)acetyl-myo-inositol L-arabinosyltransferase . Other names in common use include arabinosylindolylacetylinositol synthase , UDP-L-arabinose:indol-3-ylacetyl-myo-inositol , and L-arabinosyltransferase .
