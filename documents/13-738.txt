   Template:Rail-interchange/doc      Template:Rail-interchange/doc   The template is an abstraction layer to cope with rebranding and renaming of transport systems. The template maps     f   (   w  h  e  r  e   ,   h  o  w   )    →    b  r  a  n  d   ,   l  i  n  k   ,   i  c  o  n   (  s  )        normal-→    f     w  h  e  r  e     h  o  w        b  r  a  n  d     l  i  n  k     i  c  o  n  s      f(where,how)\to brand,link,icon(s)   allowing the whole of Wikipedia to be easily updated when a transport network switches operator, changes name or updates their logo.  Avoid brandname, operator or sponsor names when choosing the location/link pair.  Usage  The optional named parameter '''size''' will override the default height of the icon (between 10 and 20 pixels):       {{rail-interchange|buenosaires|A|size=10}}      {{rail-interchange|buenosaires|A}}      {{rail-interchange|buenosaires|A|size=20}}     The value for '''size''' must be an integer and should not be any larger than the display height of the diagram icons themselves (20 pixels in most diagrams).  The icons' wikilink and alternate text can be overridden by adding the optional parameters |link=''newlink'' and |alt=''othertext'' . Note that if only the |link= parameter is changed then the |alt= parameter will change from the default to the new link text. (However, the |alt= parameter can be changed without affecting the link target.)  In prose  Please avoid adding these icons within the prose of articles: per Wikipedia's Manual of Style for icons , "Icons should not be used in the article body... This breaks up the continuity of the text, distracting the reader".  In addition, icons used in this way are primarily decorative, e.g. "aesthetics are in the eye of the beholder: one reader's harmless decoration may be another reader's distraction": While the icons provide visual cues in certain circumstances, writing in prose will usually suffice. Instead, provide a link to the services directly.  __TOC__  Generic  The following symbols can be used to denote interchange:      Symbol   Usage        Code:  {{rint|air}}  Use: Airport station  Link:  List of airports      Code:  {{rint|bus}}  Alternative icon:  {{rint|bus|1}}  Use: Interchange with local bus services  Link:  Bus         Code:  {{rint|trolley}}  or  …|trolleybus}}  Use: Interchange with local trolleybus services  Link:  Trolleybus      Code:  {{rint|rail}}  Alternative icon:  {{rint|rail|1}}  Use: Interchange with mainline rail services  Link:  none         Code:  {{rint|express}}  Use: Interchange with express rail services  Link:  Express train      Code:  {{rint|metro}}  or  …|underground}}  or  …|subway}}  Use: Interchange with rapid transit services  Link:  Rapid transit      Code:  {{rint|mono}}  Use: Interchange with monorail line  Link:  Monorail      Code:  {{rint|tram}}  or  …|light rail}}  Alternative icon:  {{rint|tram|1}}  Use: Interchange with tram or light rail services  Link:  Tram or Light rail         Code:  {{rint|ferry}}  Use: Interchange with a passenger ferry or water bus service  Link:  Ferry      Code:  {{rint|funicular}}  or  {{rint|incline}}  Use: Interchange with a funicular  Link:  Funicular      Code:  {{rint|heritage|rail}}  Use: Interchange with a heritage railway line  Link:  Heritage railway      Code:  {{rint|heritage|tram}}  Use: Interchange with a heritage tram or streetcar line  Link:  Heritage streetcar      Code:  {{rint|bicycle}}  or  {{rint|bike}}  Use: Bicycle facilities  Link:  Bicycle      Code:  {{rint|park}}  or  {{rint|parking}}  Alternative icon:  {{rint|park|1}}  or  {{rint|parking|1}}  Use: Parking  Link:  Parking         Code:  {{rint|wheelchair}}  Use: Handicapped/disabled access  Link:  Accessibility#Transportation     Specific by country  Variants exist for a number of different places around the world to display symbols which are specific to a country or city - for example, the London Underground logo on London specific articles. Note that these are the names of the main location involved, and not the brand used by the current franchise operator (which can change frequently). If the logo should change, it can be easily updated within this template.  Please only use free content images. In most cases, using non-free logos in this manner will not comply with Wikipedia's non-free content policy .   "  Category:Rail routemap templates
