   Spacetime topology      Spacetime topology   Spacetime topology is the topological structure of spacetime , a topic studied primarily in general relativity . This physical theory models gravitation as a Lorentzian manifold (a spacetime ) and the concepts of topology thus become important in analysing local as well as global aspects of spacetime. The study of spacetime topology is especially important in physical cosmology .  Types of topology  There are two main types of topology for a spacetime   M   M   M   :  Manifold topology  As with any manifold, a spacetime possesses a natural manifold topology. Here the open sets are the image of open sets in    ℝ  4     superscript  ℝ  4    \mathbb{R}^{4}   .  Path or Zeeman topology  Definition : 1 The topology   ρ   ρ   \rho   in which a subset    E  ⊂  M      E  M    E\subset M   is open if for every timelike curve    c   c   c   there is a set   O   O   O   in the manifold topology such that     E  ∩  c   =   O  ∩  c         E  c     O  c     E\cap c=O\cap c   .  It is the finest topology which induces the same topology as   M   M   M   does on timelike curves.  Properties  Strictly finer than the manifold topology. It is therefore Hausdorff , separable but not locally compact .  A base for the topology is sets of the form      I  +    (  p  ,  U  )    ∪    I  -    (  p  ,  U  )    ∪  p         superscript  I     p  U       superscript  I     p  U    p    I^{+}(p,U)\cup I^{-}(p,U)\cup p   for some point    p  ∈  M      p  M    p\in M   and some convex normal neighbourhood    U  ⊂  M      U  M    U\subset M   .  (    I  ±     superscript  I  plus-or-minus    I^{\pm}   denote the chronological past and future ).  Alexandrov topology  The Alexandrov topology on spacetime, is the coarsest topology such that both     I  +    (  E  )        superscript  I    E    I^{+}(E)   and     I  -    (  E  )        superscript  I    E    I^{-}(E)   are open for all subsets    E  ⊂  M      E  M    E\subset M   .  Here the base of open sets for the topology are sets of the form      I  +    (  x  )    ∩    I  -    (  y  )           superscript  I    x      superscript  I    y     I^{+}(x)\cap I^{-}(y)   for some points      x   ,  y   ∈  M       x  y   M    \,x,y\in M   .  This topology coincides with the manifold topology if and only if the manifold is strongly causal but in general it is coarser.  Note, that in mathematics, an Alexandrov topology on a partial order is usually taken to be the coarsest topology in which only the upper sets     I  +    (  E  )        superscript  I    E    I^{+}(E)   are required to be open. This topology goes back to Pavel Alexandrov . Nowadays, the correct mathematical term for the Alexandrov topology on spacetime (which goes back to Alexandr D. Alexandrov ) would be the interval topology , but when Kronheimer and Penrose introduced the term this difference in nomenclature was not as clear, and in physics the term Alexandrov topology remains in use.
