   Subnormal operator      Subnormal operator   In mathematics , especially operator theory , subnormal operators are bounded operators on a Hilbert space defined by weakening the requirements for normal operators . Some examples of subnormal operators are isometries and Toeplitz operators with analytic symbols.  Definition  Let H be a Hilbert space. A bounded operator A on H is said to be subnormal if A has a normal extension . In other words, A is subnormal if there exists a Hilbert space K such that H can be embedded in K and there exists a normal operator N of the form      N  =   [     A    B      0    C     ]       N    A  B    0  C      N=\begin{bmatrix}A&B\\
 0&C\end{bmatrix}     for some bounded operators       B  :    H  ⟂   →   H  ,  and  C    :    H  ⟂   →   H  ⟂     .       normal-:  B   normal-→   superscript  H  perpendicular-to    H  and  C      normal-:     normal-→   superscript  H  perpendicular-to    superscript  H  perpendicular-to       B:H^{\perp}\rightarrow H,\quad\mbox{and}\quad C:H^{\perp}\rightarrow H^{\perp}.     Normality, quasinormality, and subnormality  Normal operators  Every normal operator is subnormal by definition, but the converse is not true in general. A simple class of examples can be obtained by weakening the properties of unitary operators . A unitary operator is an isometry with dense  range . Consider now an isometry A whose range is not necessarily dense. A concrete example of such is the unilateral shift , which is not normal. But A is subnormal and this can be shown explicitly. Define an operator U on      H  ⊕  H     direct-sum  H  H    H\oplus H     by       U  =   [     A     I  -   A   A  *         0     -   A  *       ]    .      U    A    I    A   superscript  A        0     superscript  A         U=\begin{bmatrix}A&I-AA^{*}\\
 0&-A^{*}\end{bmatrix}.     Direct calculation shows that U is unitary, therefore a normal extension of A . The operator U is called the unitary dilation of the isometry A .  Quasinormal operators  An operator A is said to be quasinormal if A commutes with A*A . A normal operator is thus quasinormal; the converse is not true. A counter example is given, as above, by the unilateral shift. Therefore the family of normal operators is a proper subset of both quasinormal and subnormal operators. A natural question is how are the quasinormal and subnormal operators related.  We will show that a quasinormal operator is necessarily subnormal but not vice versa. Thus the normal operators is a proper subfamily of quasinormal operators, which in turn are contained by the subnormal operators. To argue the claim that a quasinormal operator is subnormal, recall the following property of quasinormal operators:  Fact: A bounded operator A is quasinormal if and only if in its polar decomposition  A = UP , the partial isometry U and positive operator P commute.  Given a quasinormal A , the idea is to construct dilations for U and P in a sufficiently nice way so everything commutes. Suppose for the moment that U is an isometry. Let V be the unitary dilation of U ,       V  =   [     U     I  -   U   U  *         0     -   U  *       ]   =   [     U     D   U  *        0     -   U  *       ]    .        V    U    I    U   superscript  U        0     superscript  U              U   subscript  D   superscript  U       0     superscript  U          V=\begin{bmatrix}U&I-UU^{*}\\
 0&-U^{*}\end{bmatrix}=\begin{bmatrix}U&D_{U^{*}}\\
 0&-U^{*}\end{bmatrix}.     Define       Q  =   [     P    0      0    P     ]    .      Q    P  0    0  P      Q=\begin{bmatrix}P&0\\
 0&P\end{bmatrix}.     The operator N = VQ is clearly an extension of A . We show it is a normal extension via direct calculation. Unitarity of V means         N  *   N   =   Q   V  *   V  Q   =   Q  2   =   [      P  2     0      0     P  2      ]    .           superscript  N    N     Q   superscript  V    V  Q         superscript  Q  2           superscript  P  2   0    0   superscript  P  2        N^{*}N=QV^{*}VQ=Q^{2}=\begin{bmatrix}P^{2}&0\\
 0&P^{2}\end{bmatrix}.     On the other hand,        N   N  *    =   [       U   P  2    U  *    +    D   U  *     P  2    D   U  *         -    D   U  *     P  2   U         -    U  *    P  2    D   U  *          U  *    P  2   U      ]    .        N   superscript  N           U   superscript  P  2    superscript  U        subscript  D   superscript  U      superscript  P  2    subscript  D   superscript  U            subscript  D   superscript  U      superscript  P  2   U           superscript  U     superscript  P  2    subscript  D   superscript  U          superscript  U     superscript  P  2   U       NN^{*}=\begin{bmatrix}UP^{2}U^{*}+D_{U^{*}}P^{2}D_{U^{*}}&-D_{U^{*}}P^{2}U\\
 -U^{*}P^{2}D_{U^{*}}&U^{*}P^{2}U\end{bmatrix}.     Because UP = PU and P is self adjoint, we have U*P = PU* and D U* P = D U* P . Comparing entries then shows N is normal. This proves quasinormality implies subnormality.  For a counter example that shows the converse is not true, consider again the unilateral shift A . The operator B = A + s for some scalar s remains subnormal. But if B is quasinormal, a straightforward calculation shows that A*A = AA* , which is a contradiction.  Minimal normal extension  Non-uniqueness of normal extensions  Given a subnormal operator A , its normal extension B is not unique. For example, let A be the unilateral shift, on l 2 ( N ). One normal extension is the bilateral shift B on l 2 ( Z ) defined by        B   (  ⋯  ,   a   -  1    ,    a  ^   0   ,   a  1   ,  ⋯  )    =   (  ⋯  ,    a  ^    -  1    ,   a  0   ,   a  1   ,  ⋯  )    ,        B   normal-⋯   subscript  a    1     subscript   normal-^  a   0    subscript  a  1   normal-⋯     normal-⋯   subscript   normal-^  a     1     subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1   normal-⋯     B(\cdots,a_{-1},{\hat{a}_{0}},a_{1},\cdots)=(\cdots,{\hat{a}_{-1}},a_{0},a_{1}%
 ,\cdots),     where ˆ denotes the zero-th position. B can be expressed in terms of the operator matrix       B  =   [     A     I  -   A   A  *         0     A  *      ]    .      B    A    I    A   superscript  A        0   superscript  A        B=\begin{bmatrix}A&I-AA^{*}\\
 0&A^{*}\end{bmatrix}.     Another normal extension is given by the unitary dilation ''B' '' of A defined above:       B  ′   =   [     A     I  -   A   A  *         0     -   A  *       ]        superscript  B  normal-′     A    I    A   superscript  A        0     superscript  A         B^{\prime}=\begin{bmatrix}A&I-AA^{*}\\
 0&-A^{*}\end{bmatrix}     whose action is described by         B  ′    (  ⋯  ,   a   -  2    ,   a   -  1    ,    a  ^   0   ,   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  ⋯  )    =   (  ⋯  ,   -   a   -  2     ,    a  ^    -  1    ,   a  0   ,   a  1   ,   a  2   ,  ⋯  )    .         superscript  B  normal-′    normal-⋯   subscript  a    2     subscript  a    1     subscript   normal-^  a   0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯     normal-⋯     subscript  a    2      subscript   normal-^  a     1     subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯     B^{\prime}(\cdots,a_{-2},a_{-1},{\hat{a}_{0}},a_{1},a_{2},\cdots)=(\cdots,-a_{%
 -2},{\hat{a}_{-1}},a_{0},a_{1},a_{2},\cdots).     Minimality  Thus one is interested in the normal extension that is, in some sense, smallest. More precisely, a normal operator B acting on a Hilbert space K is said to be a minimal extension of a subnormal A if '' K' '' ⊂ K is a reducing subspace of B and H ⊂ '' K' '', then ''K' '' = K . (A subspace is a reducing subspace of B if it is invariant under both B and B* .)  One can show that if two operators B 1 and B 2 are minimal extensions on K 1 and K 2 , respectively, then there exists a unitary operator       U  :    K  1   →   K  2     .     normal-:  U   normal-→   subscript  K  1    subscript  K  2      U:K_{1}\rightarrow K_{2}.     Also, the following interwining relationship holds:        U   B  1    =    B  2   U    .        U   subscript  B  1       subscript  B  2   U     UB_{1}=B_{2}U.\,     This can be shown constructively. Consider the set S consisting of vectors of the following form:          ∑   i  =  0   n      (   B  1  *   )   i    h  i     =     h  0   +    B  1  *    h  1    +     (   B  1  *   )   2    h  2    +  ⋯  +     (   B  1  *   )   n    h  n     where      h  i   ∈  H    .     formulae-sequence      superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  1     i    subscript  h  i         subscript  h  0      superscript   subscript  B  1      subscript  h  1       superscript   superscript   subscript  B  1     2    subscript  h  2    normal-⋯     superscript   superscript   subscript  B  1     n    subscript  h  n     where       subscript  h  i   H     \sum_{i=0}^{n}(B_{1}^{*})^{i}h_{i}=h_{0}+B_{1}^{*}h_{1}+(B_{1}^{*})^{2}h_{2}+%
 \cdots+(B_{1}^{*})^{n}h_{n}\quad\mbox{where}\quad h_{i}\in H.     Let ''K' '' ⊂ K 1 be the subspace that is the closure of the linear span of S . By definition, ''K' '' is invariant under B 1 * and contains H . The normality of B 1 and the assumption that H is invariant under B 1 imply ''K' '' is invariant under B 1 . Therefore ''K' '' = K 1 . The Hilbert space K 2 can be identified in exactly the same way. Now we define the operator U as follows:       U    ∑   i  =  0   n      (   B  1  *   )   i    h  i      =    ∑   i  =  0   n      (   B  2  *   )   i    h  i           U    superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  1     i    subscript  h  i        superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  2     i    subscript  h  i       U\sum_{i=0}^{n}(B_{1}^{*})^{i}h_{i}=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(B_{2}^{*})^{i}h_{i}     Because        ⟨    ∑   i  =  0   n      (   B  1  *   )   i    h  i     ,    ∑   j  =  0   n      (   B  1  *   )   j    h  j     ⟩   =    ∑   i  j     ⟨   h  i   ,     (   B  1   )   i     (   B  1  *   )   j    h  j    ⟩    =    ∑   i  j     ⟨     (   B  2   )   j    h  i    ,     (   B  2   )   i    h  j    ⟩    =   ⟨    ∑   i  =  0   n      (   B  2  *   )   i    h  i     ,    ∑   j  =  0   n      (   B  2  *   )   j    h  j     ⟩    ,           superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  1     i    subscript  h  i       superscript   subscript     j  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  1     j    subscript  h  j        subscript     i  j      subscript  h  i      superscript   subscript  B  1   i    superscript   superscript   subscript  B  1     j    subscript  h  j             subscript     i  j        superscript   subscript  B  2   j    subscript  h  i       superscript   subscript  B  2   i    subscript  h  j              superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  2     i    subscript  h  i       superscript   subscript     j  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  2     j    subscript  h  j         \langle\sum_{i=0}^{n}(B_{1}^{*})^{i}h_{i},\sum_{j=0}^{n}(B_{1}^{*})^{j}h_{j}%
 \rangle=\sum_{ij}\langle h_{i},(B_{1})^{i}(B_{1}^{*})^{j}h_{j}\rangle=\sum_{ij%
 }\langle(B_{2})^{j}h_{i},(B_{2})^{i}h_{j}\rangle=\langle\sum_{i=0}^{n}(B_{2}^{%
 *})^{i}h_{i},\sum_{j=0}^{n}(B_{2}^{*})^{j}h_{j}\rangle,     , the operator U is unitary. Direct computation also shows (the assumption that both B 1 and B 2 are extensions of A are needed here)        if  g   =    ∑   i  =  0   n      (   B  1  *   )   i    h  i      ,       if  g     superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  1     i    subscript  h  i       \mbox{if}\quad g=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(B_{1}^{*})^{i}h_{i},           then   U   B  1   g    =    B  2   U  g   =    ∑   i  =  0   n      (   B  2  *   )   i   A   h  i      .         then    U   subscript  B  1   g       subscript  B  2   U  g          superscript   subscript     i  0    n      superscript   superscript   subscript  B  2     i   A   subscript  h  i        \mbox{then}\quad UB_{1}g=B_{2}Ug=\sum_{i=0}^{n}(B_{2}^{*})^{i}Ah_{i}.     When B 1 and B 2 are not assumed to be minimal, the same calculation shows that above claim holds verbatim with U being a partial isometry .  "  Category:Operator theory
