Kennicutt–Schmidt law

In astronomy, the Kennicutt–Schmidt Law (or simply Schmidt Law) is an empirical relation between the gas density and star formation rate (SFR) in a given region. The relation was first examined by Maarten Schmidt in a 1959 paper in which he proposed that the SFR surface density scales as some positive power 
 
 
 
  of the local gas surface density.1 i.e.


 
 . In general the SFR surface density 
 
 
 
  is in units of solar masses per year per square parsec 
 
 
 
  and the gas surface density in grams per square parsec 
 
 
 
 . Using an analysis of gaseous helium and young stars in the solar neighborhood, the local density of white dwarfs and their luminosity function, and the local helium density, Schmidt suggested a value of 
 
 
 
  (and very likely between 1 and 3). All of the data used were gathered from the Milky Way, and specifically the solar-neighborhood.
More recently, Robert Kennicutt examined the connection between gas density and SFR for nearly 100 nearby galaxies to estimate a value of
