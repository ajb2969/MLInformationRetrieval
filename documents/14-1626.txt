   Kennicutt–Schmidt law      Kennicutt–Schmidt law   In astronomy , the Kennicutt–Schmidt Law (or simply Schmidt Law ) is an empirical relation between the gas density and star formation rate (SFR) in a given region. The relation was first examined by Maarten Schmidt in a 1959 paper in which he proposed that the SFR surface density scales as some positive power   n   n   n   of the local gas surface density. 1 i.e.       Σ   S  F  R    ∝    (   Σ   g  a  s    )   n      proportional-to   subscript  normal-Σ    S  F  R     superscript   subscript  normal-Σ    g  a  s    n     \Sigma_{SFR}\propto(\Sigma_{gas})^{n}   . In general the SFR surface density    (   Σ   S  F  R    )     subscript  normal-Σ    S  F  R     (\Sigma_{SFR})   is in units of solar masses per year per square parsec    (     M  ⊙     yr   -  1     pc   -  2     )       subscript  M  direct-product    superscript  yr    1     superscript  pc    2      (M_{\odot}~{}\textrm{ yr}^{-1}\textrm{ pc}^{-2})   and the gas surface density in grams per square parsec    (    g    pc   -  2     )      g   superscript  pc    2      (\textrm{g}~{}\textrm{pc}^{-2})   . Using an analysis of gaseous helium and young stars in the solar neighborhood, the local density of white dwarfs and their luminosity function , and the local helium density, Schmidt suggested a value of    n  ≈  2      n  2    n\approx 2   (and very likely between 1 and 3). All of the data used were gathered from the Milky Way, and specifically the solar-neighborhood.  More recently, Robert Kennicutt examined the connection between gas density and SFR for nearly 100 nearby galaxies to estimate a value of    n  =   1.4  ±  0.15       n   plus-or-minus  1.4  0.15     n=1.4\pm 0.15   . 2  References  "  Category:Stellar astronomy  Category:Galaxies  Category:Star formation
