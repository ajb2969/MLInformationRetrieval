Watson's lemma

In mathematics, Watson's lemma, proved by G. N. Watson (1918, p. 133), has significant application within the theory on the asymptotic behavior of integrals.
Statement of the lemma
Let 
 
 
 
  be fixed. Assume 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  has an infinite number of derivatives in the neighborhood of 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose, in addition, either that



where 
 
 
 
  are independent of 
 
 
 
 , or that



Then, it is true that for all positive 
 
 
 
  that



and that the following asymptotic equivalence holds:



See, for instance,  for the original proof or  for a more recent development.
Proof
We will prove the version of Watson's lemma which assumes that 
 
 
 
  has at most exponential growth as 
 
 
 
 . The basic idea behind the proof is that we will approximate 
 
 
 
  by finitely many terms of its Taylor series. Since the derivatives of 
 
 
 
  are only assumed to exist in a neighborhood of the origin, we will essentially proceed by removing the tail of the integral, applying Taylor's theorem with remainder in the remaining small interval, then adding the tail back on in the end. At each step we will carefully estimate how much we are throwing away or adding on. This proof is a modification of the one found in .
Let 
 
 
 
  and suppose that 
 
 
 
  is a measurable function of the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  has an infinite number of continuous derivatives in the interval 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
 , and that 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , where the constants 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are independent of 
 
 
 
 .
We can show that the integral is finite for 
 
 
 
  large enough by writing


 
  and estimating each term.
For the first term we have


 
  for 
 
 
 
 , where the last integral is finite by the assumptions that 
 
 
 
  is continuous on the interval 
 
 
 
  and that 
 
 
 
 . For the second term we use the assumption that 
 
 
 
  is exponentially bounded to see that, for 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 
  The finiteness of the original integral then follows from applying the triangle inequality to 
 
 
 
 .
We can deduce from the above calculation that


 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
By appealing to Taylor's theorem with remainder we know that, for each integer 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  for 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 . Plugging this in to the first term in 
 
 
 
  we get


 
 
  To bound the term involving the remainder we use the assumption that 
 
 
 
 
  is continuous on the interval 
 
 
 
 , and in particular it is bounded there. As such we see that


 
 
  Here we have used the fact that


 
  if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the gamma function.
From the above calculation we see from 
 
 
 
  that


 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
We will now add the tails on to each integral in 
 
 
 
 . For each 
 
 
 
  we have


 
 
  and we will show that the remaining integrals are exponentially small. Indeed, if we make the change of variables 
 
 
 
  we get


 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , so that


 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
If we substitute this last result into 
 
 
 
  we find that


 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 . Finally, substituting this into 
 
 
 
  we conclude that


 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 .
Since this last expression is true for each integer 
 
 
 
  we have thus shown that


 
  as 
 
 
 
 , where the infinite series is interpreted as an asymptotic expansion of the integral in question.
Example
When 
 
 
 
 , the confluent hypergeometric function of the first kind has the integral representation


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the gamma function. The change of variables 
 
 
 
  puts this into the form


 
  which is now amenable to the use of Watson's lemma. Taking 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , Watson's lemma tells us that


 
  which allows us to conclude that
