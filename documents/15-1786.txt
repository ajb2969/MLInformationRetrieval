Mahler's 3/2 problem

In mathematics, Mahler's 3/2 problem concerns the existence of "Z-numbers".
A Z-number is a real number x such that the fractional parts



are less than 1/2 for all natural numbers n. Kurt Mahler conjectured in 1968 that there are no Z-numbers.
More generally, for a real number α, define Ω(α) as



Mahler's conjecture would thus imply that Ω(3/2) exceeds 1/2. Flatto, Lagarias, and Pollington showed1 that



for rational p/q.
