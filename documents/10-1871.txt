   Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase      Thiosulfate sulfurtransferase   In enzymology , a thiosulfate sulfurtransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   thiosulfate + cyanide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sulfite + thiocyanate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are thiosulfate and cyanide , whereas its two products are sulfite and thiocyanate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfurtransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thiosulfate:cyanide sulfurtransferase . Other names in common use include thiosulfate cyanide transsulfurase , thiosulfate thiotransferase , rhodanese , and rhodanase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 11 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , and .
