   Pivotal altitude      Pivotal altitude    Pivotal altitude is the altitude for a given ground speed at which the line of sight from the cockpit directly parallel to the lateral axis of the aircraft will remain stationary on an object on the ground. 1  A rule of thumb for calculating the pivotal altitude H in feet , given the speed in knots    v   v   v   , is      H  =    v  2   11.3       H     superscript  v  2   11.3     H=\frac{v^{2}}{11.3}     References  "  Category:Altitudes in aviation     United States Department of Transportation, Federal Aviation Administration, FAA-H-8083-3A, Airplane Flying Handbook â†©
