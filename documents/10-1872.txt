   Thiosulfate—thiol sulfurtransferase      Thiosulfate—thiol sulfurtransferase   In enzymology , a thiosulfate-thiol sulfurtransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   thiosulfate + 2 glutathione   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   sulfite + glutathione disulfide + sulfide   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are thiosulfate and glutathione , whereas its 3 products are sulfite , glutathione disulfide , and sulfide .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the sulfurtransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thiosulfate:thiol sulfurtransferase . Other names in common use include glutathione-dependent thiosulfate reductase , sulfane reductase , and sulfane sulfurtransferase . This enzyme participates in glutathione metabolism .
