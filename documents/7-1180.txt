   Chetaev instability theorem      Chetaev instability theorem   The Chetaev instability theorem for dynamical systems states that if there exists for the system     𝐱  ˙   =   X   (  𝐱  )         normal-˙  x     X  x     \dot{\textbf{x}}=X(\textbf{x})   a function V( x ) such that   in any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin there is a region D 1 in which V( x ) > 0 and on whose boundaries V( x ) = 0;  at all points of the region in which V( x ) > 0 the total time derivative      V  ˙    (  𝐱  )        normal-˙  V   x    \dot{V}(\textbf{x})   assumes positive values along every trajectory of     𝐱  ˙   =   X   (  𝐱  )         normal-˙  x     X  x     \dot{\textbf{x}}=X(\textbf{x})     the origin is a boundary point of D 1 ;   then the trivial solution is unstable.  This theorem is somewhat less restrictive than the Lyapunov instability theorems , since a complete sphere (circle) around the origin for which V and    V  ˙     normal-˙  V    \dot{V}   both are of the same sign does not have to be produced.  It is named after Nicolai Gurevich Chetaev .  References     "  Category:Theorems in dynamical systems
