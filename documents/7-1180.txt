Chetaev instability theorem

The Chetaev instability theorem for dynamical systems states that if there exists for the system 
 
 
 
  a function V(x) such that

in any arbitrarily small neighborhood of the origin there is a region D1 in which V(x) > 0 and on whose boundaries V(x) = 0;
at all points of the region in which V(x) > 0 the total time derivative

 
  assumes positive values along every trajectory of 
 
 

the origin is a boundary point of D1;

then the trivial solution is unstable.
This theorem is somewhat less restrictive than the Lyapunov instability theorems, since a complete sphere (circle) around the origin for which V and 
 
 
 
 
  both are of the same sign does not have to be produced.
It is named after Nicolai Gurevich Chetaev.
