Perpendicular bisector construction of a quadrilateral

In geometry, the perpendicular bisector construction of a quadrilateral is a construction which produces a new quadrilateral from a given quadrilateral using the perpendicular bisectors to the sides of the former quadrilateral. This construction arises naturally in an attempt to find a replacement for the circumcenter of a quadrilateral in the case that is non-cyclic.
Definition of the construction
Suppose that the vertices of the quadrilateral

 
  are given by 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the perpendicular bisectors of sides 
 
 
 
 
  respectively. Then their intersections 
 
 
 
 , with subscripts considered modulo 4, form the consequent quadrilateral 
 
 
 
 . The construction is then iterated on 
 
 
 
  to produce 
 
 
 
  and so on. 
An equivalent construction can be obtained by letting the vertices of 
 
 
 
 
  be the circumcenters of the 4 triangles formed by selecting combinations of 3 vertices of 
 
 
 
 .
Properties
1. If 
 
 
 
  is not cyclic, then 
 
 
 
  is not degenerate.1
2. Quadrilateral 
 
 
 
  is never cyclic.2 Combining #1 and #2, 
 
 
 
 
  is always nondegenrate.
3. Quadrilaterals 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are homothetic, and in particular, similar.3 Quadrilaterals 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are also homothetic.
3. The perpendicular bisector construction can be reversed via isogonal conjugation.4 That is, given 
 
 
 
 
 , it is possible to construct 
 
 
 
 .
4. Let 
 
 
 
  be the angles of 
 
 
 
 . For every 
 
 
 
 , the ratio of areas of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is given by5



5. If 
 
 
 
  is convex then the sequence of quadrilaterals 
 
 
 
  converges to the isoptic point of 
 
 
 
 
 , which is also the isoptic point for every 
 
 
 
 . Similarly, if 
 
 
 
  is concave, then the sequence 
 
 
 
  obtained by reversing the construction converges to the Isoptic Point of the 
 
 
 
 's.6
