   Procept      Procept   A procept is an amalgam of three components: a process which produces a mathematical object and a symbol which is used to represent either process or object. It derives from the work of Eddie Gray and David O. Tall , and is a much used construct in mathematics education research.  The notion was first published in a paper in the Journal for Research in Mathematics Education in 1994, and is part of the process-object literature. This body of literature suggests that mathematical objects are formed by encapsulating processes, that is to say that the mathematical object 3 is formed by an encapsulation of the process of counting: 1,2,3...  Gray & Tall's notion of procept improved upon the existing literature by noting that mathematical notation is often ambiguous as to whether it refers to process or object. Examples of such notations are:      3  +  4      3  4    3+4   : refers to the process of adding as well as the outcome of the process.       ∑   n  =  0   ∞    (   a  n   )       superscript   subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n     \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}(a_{n})   : refers to the process of summing an infinite sequence, and to the outcome of the process.       f   (  x  )    =    3  x   +  2         f  x       3  x   2     f(x)=3x+2   : refers to the process of mapping x to 3x+2 as well as the outcome of that process, the function f(x).
