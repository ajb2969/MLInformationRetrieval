   Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase      Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase   Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase (, anhMurNAc kinase , AnmK ) is an enzyme with system name ATP:1,6-anhydro-N-acetyl-beta-muramate 6-phosphotransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ATP + 1,6-anhydro-N-acetyl-beta-muramate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate   This enzyme is required for the utilization of anhydro- N-acetylmuramic acid in proteobacteria .
