Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase

Anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid kinase (, anhMurNAc kinase, AnmK) is an enzyme with system name ATP:1,6-anhydro-N-acetyl-beta-muramate 6-phosphotransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + 1,6-anhydro-N-acetyl-beta-muramate + H2O 
 
 
 
  ADP + N-acetylmuramate 6-phosphate
 

This enzyme is required for the utilization of anhydro-N-acetylmuramic acid in proteobacteria.
