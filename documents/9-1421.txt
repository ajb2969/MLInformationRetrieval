   Zerodur      Zerodur  Zerodur (notation of the manufacturer: ZERODUR®), a registered trademark of Schott AG , 1 is a lithium aluminosilicate  glass-ceramic 2 produced by Schott AG since 1968. 3 It has been used for a number of very large telescope mirrors including Keck I , Keck II, 4 and SOFIA . With its very low coefficient of thermal expansion it can be used to produce mirrors which retain acceptable figures in extremely cold environments such as deep space. 5 Although it has advantages for applications requiring a coefficient of thermal expansion less than that of borosilicate glass it remains very expensive as compared to borosilicate. The tight tolerance on    CTE  ±    0.007  ×   10   -  6     /  K      plus-or-minus  CTE      0.007   superscript  10    6     K     \mathrm{CTE}\pm 0.007\times 10^{-6}/K   allows for highly accurate applications which require high-precision.  Zerodur has both an amorphous (vitreous) component and a crystalline component. Its most important properties 6 are:   Particularly low thermal expansion : in the range 0 to 50°C it has a mean of 0 ± 0.007 × 10 −6 /K which is two orders of magnitude better than that of fused quartz 7  High 3D homogeneity with few inclusions, bubbles and internal stria - (as contrasted to Cer-Vit )  Hardness similar to borosilicate glass so that it can be ground and polished more easily than fused quartz  High affinity for coatings  Low helium permeability  Non-porous - (as contrasted to sintered ceramics)  Good chemical stability similar to that of fused quartz  Fracture toughness approximately 0.9 MPa x m 1/2  8  9   Applications  (Figure)  The Keck II Telescope showing the segmented primary mirror made of Zerodur    Optics  Microlithography  Measurement technology 10   Properties 11   Dispersion : (nf − nc) = 0.00967  Density : 2.53 g/cm 3 at 25 °C  Young's Modulus : 9.1 x 10 10  Pa  Poisson Ratio : 0.24  Specific heat capacity at 25 °C: 0.196 cal/(g·K) = 0.82 J/(g·K)  Coefficient of thermal expansion (20 °C to 300 °C) : 0.05 ± 0.10 × 10 −6 /K  Thermal conductivity : at 20 °C: 1.46 W/(m·K)  Maximum application temperature: 600 °C  Impact resistance behavior is substantially similar to other glass 12   See also   CorningWare  Macor  Ring laser gyroscope  Sitall   References    External links  "  Category:Glass types  Category:Low-expansion glass  Category:Zero thermal expansion materials  Category:Glass-ceramics  Category:Glass trademarks and brands  Category:Transparent materials  Category:German brands     http://www.unitedlens.com/page175.html ↩  ↩  [ http://www.schott.com/advanced_optics/english/syn/advanced_optics/products/optical-materials/zerodur-zero-expansion-glass-ceramic/zerodur/index.html?so=uk 〈=english Schott AG Zerodur description] ↩  ↩  ↩  Schott AG Zerodur properties ↩  SCHOTT CTE Grades ↩   ↩    ↩
