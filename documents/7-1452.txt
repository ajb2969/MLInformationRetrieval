SMS4

SMS4 is a block cipher used in the Chinese National Standard for Wireless LAN WAPI (Wired Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure).
SMS4 was a proposed cipher to be used in IEEE 802.11i standard, but has so far been rejected by ISO. One of the reasons for the rejection has been opposition to the WAPI fast-track proposal by the IEEE.
The SMS4 algorithm was invented by Prof. LU Shu-wang(吕述望). The algorithm was declassified in January, 2006. A few details of the SMS4 cipher are:

It has a block size of 128 bits.
Uses an 8-bit S-box
The key size is 128 bits.
The only operations used are XOR, circular shifts and S-Box applications
Performs 32 rounds to process one block.
Each round updates a quarter (32 bits) of the internal state.
A non-linear key schedule is used to produce the round keys.
Decryption is using the same keys as encryption, but in reversed order.
