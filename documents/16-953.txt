   Vertical vector field      Vertical vector field   In differential geometry , a vertical vector field is a vector field on a principal G - bundle     π  :   P  →  M      normal-:  π   normal-→  P  M     \pi:P\to M   that is in the kernel of    d  π      d  π    d\pi   at each point of P . 1 More generally, the projection    π  :   P  →  M      normal-:  π   normal-→  P  M     \pi:P\to M   needs only to be a fibered manifold , i.e., a surjective  submersion .
