With a stellar classification of M3 III,4 this is a red giant star that has exhausted the hydrogen at its core and evolved away from the main sequence of stars like the Sun. The luminosity of this star varies over time, following multiple periods of variability.5 The measured angular diameter of this star, after correction for limb darkening, is .6 At the estimated distance of 3 Aquarii,7 this yields a physical size of about 108 times the radius of the Sun.8 The effective temperature of the outer atmosphere is 3,933 K,9 giving this star the cool reddish hue of an M-type star.
