   Cyclic permutation      Cyclic permutation   In mathematics , and in particular in group theory , a cyclic permutation is a permutation of the elements of some set X which maps the elements of some subset S of X to each other in a cyclic fashion, while fixing (i.e., mapping to themselves) all other elements of X . For example, the permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4} that sends 1 to 3, 3 to 2, 2 to 4 and 4 to 1 is a cycle, while the permutation that sends 1 to 3, 3 to 1, 2 to 4 and 4 to 2 is not (it separately permutes the pairs {1, 3} and {2, 4}).  A cycle in a permutation is a subset of the elements that are permuted in this way. The set S is called the orbit of the cycle. Every permutation on finitely many elements can be decomposed into a collection of cycles on disjoint orbits. In some contexts, a cyclic permutation itself is called a cycle.  Definition  right|mapping of permutation A permutation is called a cyclic permutation if and only if it consists of a single nontrivial cycle (a cycle of length > 1). 1  Example:       (     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8      4    2    7    6    5    8    1    3     )   =   (     1    4    6    8    3    7    2    5      4    6    8    3    7    1    2    5     )   =    (  146837  )    (  2  )    (  5  )            1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8    4  2  7  6  5  8  1  3      1  4  6  8  3  7  2  5    4  6  8  3  7  1  2  5           146837  2  5      \begin{pmatrix}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8\\

 4&6&8&3&7&1&2&5\end{pmatrix}=(146837)(2)(5)     Some authors restrict the definition to only those permutations which have precisely one cycle (that is, no fixed points allowed). 2  right|mapping of permutation  Example:       (     1    2    3    4    5    6    7    8      4    5    7    6    8    2    1    3     )   =   (     1    4    6    2    5    8    3    7      4    6    2    5    8    3    7    1     )   =   (  14625837  )           1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8    4  5  7  6  8  2  1  3      1  4  6  2  5  8  3  7    4  6  2  5  8  3  7  1         14625837     \begin{pmatrix}1&2&3&4&5&6&7&8\\

 4&6&2&5&8&3&7&1\end{pmatrix}=(14625837)     More formally, a permutation of a set X , which is a bijective function     œÉ  :   X  ‚Üí  X      normal-:  œÉ   normal-‚Üí  X  X     \sigma:X\to X   , is called a cycle if the action on X of the subgroup generated by   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   has at most one orbit with more than a single element. 3 This notion is most commonly used when X is a finite set; then of course the largest orbit, S , is also finite. Let    s  0     subscript  s  0    s_{0}   be any element of S , and put     s  i   =    œÉ  i    (   s  0   )         subscript  s  i      superscript  œÉ  i    subscript  s  0      s_{i}=\sigma^{i}(s_{0})\,   for any    i  ‚àà  ùêô      i  ùêô    i\in\mathbf{Z}   . If S is finite, there is a minimal number    k  ‚â•  1      k  1    k\geq 1   for which     s  k   =   s  0        subscript  s  k    subscript  s  0     s_{k}=s_{0}   . Then    S  =   {   s  0   ,   s  1   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   s   k  -  1    }       S    subscript  s  0    subscript  s  1   normal-‚Ä¶   subscript  s    k  1       S=\{s_{0},s_{1},\ldots,s_{k-1}\}   , and   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   is the permutation defined by      X  ‚àñ  S      X  S    X\setminus S   for any element of   œÉ   œÉ   \sigma   .

A cycle can be written using the compact cycle notation     s  0     subscript  s  0    s_{0}   (there are no commas between elements in this notation, to avoid confusion with a k - tuple ). The length of a cycle, is the number of elements of its largest orbit. A cycle of length k is also called a ''' k -cycle'''.  The orbit of a 1-cycle is called a fixed point of the permutation, but as a permutation every 1-cycle is the identity permutation . 4 When cycle notation is used, the 1-cycles are often suppressed when no confusion will result. 5  Basic properties  One of the basic results on symmetric groups says that any permutation can be expressed as the product of disjoint cycles (more precisely: cycles with disjoint orbits); such cycles commute with each other, and the expression of the permutation is unique up to the order of the cycles (but note that the cycle notation is not unique: each k -cycle can itself be written in k different ways, depending on the choice of    1  ‚â§  k  ‚â§  n        1  k       n     1\leq k\leq n   in its orbit). 6 The multiset of lengths of the cycles in this expression (the cycle type ) is therefore uniquely determined by the permutation, and both the signature and the conjugacy class of the permutation in the symmetric group are determined by it. 7  The number of k -cycles in the symmetric group S n is given, for      (     n      k     )     (   k  -  1   )   !    =    n   (   n  -  1   )   ‚ãØ   (    n  -  k   +  1   )    k   =    n  !      (   n  -  k   )   !   k             binomial  n  k       k  1         n    n  1   normal-‚ãØ      n  k   1    k            n         n  k    k       {\left({{n}\atop{k}}\right)}(k-1)!=\frac{n(n-1)\cdots(n-k+1)}{k}=\frac{n!}{(n-%
 k)!k}   , by the following equivalent formulas      a  =  1      a  1    a=1     A k -cycle has signature (‚àí1) k ‚àí¬†1 .  Transpositions  A cycle with only two elements is called a transposition . For example, the permutation of {1, 2, 3, 4} that sends 1 to 1, 2 to 4, 3 to 3 and 4 to 2 is a transposition (specifically, the transposition that swaps 2 and 4).  Properties  Any permutation can be expressed as the composition (product) of transpositions‚Äîformally, they are generators for the group . 8 In fact, if one takes    b  =  2      b  2    b=2   ,    e  =  5      e  5    e=5   , ...,     (     k   k   +  1   )   ,        k  k   1    (k~{}~{}k+1),   , then any permutation can be expressed as a product of , meaning the transpositions    (    1   2   )      1  2    (1~{}2)   in this case    (    2   3   )      2  3    (2~{}3)   ,    (    3   4   )      3  4    (3~{}4)   ,     (    4   5   )   .      4  5    (4~{}5).   , and    (    k   l   )      k  l    (k~{}~{}l)   This follows because an arbitrary transposition can be expressed as the product of adjacent transpositions. Concretely, one can express the transposition    k  <  l      k  l    k   where      (    k   l   )   =       (     k   k   +  1   )   ‚ãÖ   (   k  +    1   k   +  2   )    ‚ãØ   (   l  -    1   l    )    ‚ãÖ   (   l  -    2   l   -  1   )    ‚ãØ   (     k   k   +  1   )     .        k  l      normal-‚ãÖ     normal-‚ãÖ      k  k   1     k    1  k   2    normal-‚ãØ    l    1  l       l    2  l   1    normal-‚ãØ      k  k   1      (k~{}~{}l)=(k~{}~{}k+1)\cdot(k+1~{}~{}k+2)\cdots(l-1~{}~{}l)\cdot(l-2~{}~{}l-1%
 )\cdots(k~{}~{}k+1).   by moving k to l one step at a time, then moving l back to where k was, which interchanges these two and makes no other changes:       (    a    b    c    d    ‚Ä¶    y   z   )   =    (    a   b   )   ‚ãÖ   (    b    c    d    ‚Ä¶    y   z   )          a  b  c  d  normal-‚Ä¶  y  z    normal-‚ãÖ    a  b     b  c  d  normal-‚Ä¶  y  z      (a~{}b~{}c~{}d~{}\ldots~{}y~{}z)=(a~{}b)\cdot(b~{}c~{}d~{}\ldots~{}y~{}z)     The decomposition of a permutation into a product of transpositions is obtained for example by writing the permutation as a product of disjoint cycles, and then splitting iteratively each of the cycles of length 3 and longer into a product of a transposition and a cycle of length one less:     a   a   a     This means the initial request is to move   b   b   b   to   b   b   b   ,   c   c   c   to   y   y   y   ,   z   z   z   to   z   z   z   and finally   a   a   a   to   a   a   a   . Instead one may roll the elements keeping   z   z   z   where it is by executing the right factor first (as usual in operator notation, and following the convention in the article on Permutations ). This has moved   b   b   b   to the position of   a   a   a   , so after the first permutation, the elements   z   z   z   and    (    a   b   )      a  b    (a~{}b)   are not yet at their final positions. The transposition   z   z   z   , executed thereafter, then addresses   b   b   b   by the index of   a   a   a   to swap what initially were   z   z   z   and $z$ .  In fact, the symmetric group is a Coxeter group , meaning that it is generated by elements of order 2 (the adjacent transpositions), and all relations are of a certain form.  One of the main results on symmetric groups states that either all of the decompositions of a given permutation into transpositions have an even number of transpositions, or they all have an odd number of transpositions. 9 This permits the parity of a permutation to be a well-defined concept.
