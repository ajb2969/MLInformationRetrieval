   Cis-1,2-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase      Cis-1,2-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cis-1,2-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   cis-1,2-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-methylcatechol + NAD(P)H + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are cis-1,2-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 4-methylcatechol , NADH , NADPH , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-1,2-dihydroxy-4-methylcyclohexa-3,5-diene-1-carboxylate:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase (decarboxylating) . This enzyme participates in toluene and xylene degradation.
