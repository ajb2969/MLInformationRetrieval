   Berberine reductase      Berberine reductase   Berberine reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-canadine + 2 NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   berberine + 2 NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-canadine and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ion, whereas its 3 products are berberine , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate , and hydrogen ion .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-tetrahydroberberine:NADP+ oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called (R)-canadine synthase .
