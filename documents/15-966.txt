Quadratic set

In mathematics, a quadratic set is a set of points in a projective plane/space which bears the same essential incidence properties as a quadric (conic section in a projective plane, sphere or cone or hyperboloid in a projective space).
Definition of a quadratic set
Let be 
 
 
 
  a projective space. A non empty subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  is called quadratic set if

(QS1) Any line 
 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  intersects 
 
 
 
  in at most 2 points or is contained in 
 
 
 
 .
 
(
 
 
 
  is called exterior, tangent and secant line if 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively.)
 
(QS2) For any point 
 
 
 
  the union 
 
 
 
  of all tangent lines through 
 
 
 
  is a hyperplane or the entire space 
 
 
 
 
 .
 

A quadratic set 
 
 
 
  is called non degenerated if for any point 
 
 
 
  set 
 
 
 
  is a hyperplane.
The following result is an astonishing statement for finite projective spaces.
Theorem(BUEKENHOUT): Let be 
 
 
 
  a finite projective space of dimension 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  a non degenerated quadratic set which contains lines. Then: 
 
 
 
  is pappian and 
 
 
 
  is a quadric with index 
 
 
 
 .
Definition of an oval and an ovoid
Ovals and ovoids are special quadratic sets:
 Let 
 
 
 
 
  be a projective space of dimension 
 
 
 
 . A non degenerated quadratic set 
 
 
 
  that does not contain lines is called ovoid (or oval in plane case).
The following equivalent definition of an oval/ovoid are more common:
Definition: (oval) A non empty point set 
 
 
 
  of a projective plane is called oval if the following properties are fulfilled:

(o1) Any line meets 
 
 
 
  in at most two points.
 
(o2) For any point 
 
 
 
 
  there is one and only one line 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
 

A line 
 
 
 
  is a exterior or tangent or secant line of the oval if \ 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  respectively.
For finite planes the following theorem provides a more simple definition.
'''Theorem: (oval in finite plane) '''Let be 
 
 
 
  a projective plane of order 
 
 
 
 . A set 
 
 
 
  of points is an oval if 
 
 
 
 
  and if no three points of 
 
 
 
  are collinear.
For pappian projective planes of odd order the ovals are just conics:
Theorem (SEGRE): Let be 
 
 
 
  a pappian projective plane of odd order. Any oval in 
 
 
 
  is an oval conic (non degenerate quadric).
Definition: (ovoid) A non empty point set 
 
 
 
  of a projective space is called ovoid if the following properties are fulfilled:

(O1) Any line meets 
 
 
 
 
  in at most two points.
 
(
 
 
 
  is called exterior, tangent and secant line if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively.)
 
(O2) For any point 
 
 
 
  the union 
 
 
 
 
  of all tangent lines through 
 
 
 
  is a hyperplane (tangent plane at 
 
 
 
 ).
 

Example:

a) Any sphere (quadric of index 1) is an ovoid.
 
b) In case of real projective spaces one can construct ovoids by combining halves of suitable ellipsoids such that they are no quadrics.
 

For finite projective spaces of dimension 
 
 
 
  over a field

 
  we have:
Theorem:

a) In case of 
 
 
 
 
  an ovoid in 
 
 
 
  exists only if 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .
 
b) In case of 
 
 
 
  an ovoid in 
 
 
 
 
  is a quadric.
 

Counter examples (TITS–SUZUKI-ovoid) show that i.g. statement b) of the theorem above is not true for
