   Displacement (vector)      Displacement (vector)   A displacement is the shortest distance from the initial to the final position of a point P. 1 Thus, it is the length of an imaginary straight path, typically distinct from the path actually travelled by P. A displacement vector represents the length and direction of this imaginary straight path.  A position vector expresses the position of a point P in space in terms of a displacement from an arbitrary reference point O (typically the origin of a coordinate system). Namely, it indicates both the distance and direction of an imaginary motion along a straight line from the reference position to the actual position of the point.  A displacement may be also described as a 'relative position': the final position of a point ( R f ) relative to its initial position ( R i ), and a displacement vector can be mathematically defined as the difference between the final and initial position vectors:      𝒔  =    𝑹  𝒇   -   𝑹  𝒊    =   Δ  𝑹         𝒔     subscript  𝑹  𝒇    subscript  𝑹  𝒊           normal-Δ  𝑹      \boldsymbol{s}=\boldsymbol{R_{f}-R_{i}}=\Delta\boldsymbol{R}     In considering motions of objects over time the instantaneous velocity of the object is the rate of change of the displacement as a function of time. The velocity then is distinct from the instantaneous speed which is the time rate of change of the distance traveled along a specific path. The velocity may be equivalently defined as the time rate of change of the position vector. If one considers a moving initial position, or equivalently a moving origin (e.g. an initial position or origin which is fixed to a train wagon, which in turn moves with respect to its rail track), the velocity of P (e.g. a point representing the position of a passenger walking on the train) may be referred to as a relative velocity, as opposed to an absolute velocity, which is computed with respect to a point which is considered to be 'fixed in space' (such as, for instance, a point fixed on the floor of the train station).  For motion over a given interval of time, the displacement divided by the length of the time interval defines the average velocity. (Note that the average velocity , as a vector, differs from the average speed that is the ratio of the path length — a scalar — and the time interval.)  Rigid body  In dealing with the motion of a rigid body , the term displacement may also include the rotations of the body. In this case, the displacement of a particle of the body is called linear displacement (displacement along a line), while the rotation of the body is called angular displacement .  Derivatives  For a position vector s that is a function of time t , the derivatives can be computed with respect to t . These derivatives have common utility in the study of kinematics , control theory , vibration sensing and other sciences and engineering disciplines.

Study of these higher order derivatives can improve approximations of the original displacement function. Such higher-order terms are required in order to accurately represent the displacement function as a sum of an infinite series , enabling several analytical techniques in engineering and physics.
