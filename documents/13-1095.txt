   Ψ₀(Ωω)      Ψ₀(Ωω)    In mathematics, Ψ 0 (Ω ω ) is a large countable ordinal that is used to measure the proof-theoretic strength of some mathematical systems. In particular, it is the proof theoretic ordinal of the subsystem    Π  1  1     superscript   subscript  normal-Π  1   1    \Pi_{1}^{1}   -CA 0 of second-order arithmetic ; this is one of the "big five" subsystems studied in reverse mathematics (Simpson 1999).  Definition        Ω  0   =  0       subscript  normal-Ω  0   0    \Omega_{0}=0   , and     Ω  n   =   ℵ  n        subscript  normal-Ω  n    subscript  normal-ℵ  n     \Omega_{n}=\aleph_{n}   for n > 0.       C  i    (  α  )        subscript  C  i   α    C_{i}(\alpha)   is the smallest set of ordinals that contains    Ω  n     subscript  normal-Ω  n    \Omega_{n}   for n finite, and contains all ordinals less than    Ω  i     subscript  normal-Ω  i    \Omega_{i}   , and is closed under ordinal addition and exponentiation, and contains     Ψ  j    (  ξ  )        subscript  normal-Ψ  j   ξ    \Psi_{j}(\xi)   if j ≥ i and    ξ  ∈    C  i    (  α  )        ξ     subscript  C  i   α     \xi\in C_{i}(\alpha)   and    ξ  <  α      ξ  α    \xi<\alpha   .       Ψ  i    (  α  )        subscript  normal-Ψ  i   α    \Psi_{i}(\alpha)   is the smallest ordinal not in     C  i    (  α  )        subscript  C  i   α    C_{i}(\alpha)      References   G.
