Ψ₀(Ωω)

  In mathematics, Ψ0(Ωω) is a large countable ordinal that is used to measure the proof-theoretic strength of some mathematical systems. In particular, it is the proof theoretic ordinal of the subsystem 
 
 
 
 -CA0 of second-order arithmetic; this is one of the "big five" subsystems studied in reverse mathematics (Simpson 1999).
