Comodule

In mathematics, a comodule or corepresentation is a concept dual to a module. The definition of a comodule over a coalgebra is formed by dualizing the definition of a module over an associative algebra.
Formal definition
Let K be a field, and C be a coalgebra over K. A (right) comodule over C is a K-vector space M together with a linear map



such that






 
 ,

where Δ is the comultiplication for C, and ε is the counit.
Note that in the second rule we have identified 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

A coalgebra is a comodule over itself.


If M is a finite-dimensional module over a finite-dimensional K-algebra A, then the set of linear functions from A to K forms a coalgebra, and the set of linear functions from M to K forms a comodule over that coalgebra.


A graded vector space V can be made into a comodule. Let I be the index set for the graded vector space, and let 
 
 
 
  be the vector space with basis 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . We turn 
 
 
 
  into a coalgebra and V into a 
 
 
 
 -comodule, as follows:

:# Let the comultiplication on 
 
 
 
  be given by 
 
 
 
 .
:# Let the counit on 
 
 
 
  be given by 
 
 
 
 .
:# Let the map 
 
 
 
  on V be given by 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the i-th homogeneous piece of 
 
 
 
 .
Rational comodule
If M is a (right) comodule over the coalgebra C, then M is a (left) module over the dual algebra C∗, but the converse is not true in general: a module over C∗ is not necessarily a comodule over C. A rational comodule is a module over C∗ which becomes a comodule over C in the natural way.
