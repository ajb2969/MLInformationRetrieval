   Comodule      Comodule   In mathematics , a comodule or corepresentation is a concept dual to a module . The definition of a comodule over a coalgebra is formed by dualizing the definition of a module over an associative algebra .  Formal definition  Let K be a field , and C be a coalgebra over K . A (right) comodule over C is a K - vector space  M together with a linear map      ρ  :   M  →   M  ⊗  C       normal-:  ρ   normal-→  M   tensor-product  M  C      \rho:M\to M\otimes C     such that         (    i  d   ⊗  Δ   )   ∘  ρ   =    (    ρ  ⊗  i   d   )   ∘  ρ          tensor-product    i  d   normal-Δ   ρ        tensor-product  ρ  i   d   ρ     (id\otimes\Delta)\circ\rho=(\rho\otimes id)\circ\rho           (    i  d   ⊗  ε   )   ∘  ρ   =   i  d          tensor-product    i  d   ε   ρ     i  d     (id\otimes\varepsilon)\circ\rho=id   ,   where Δ is the comultiplication for C , and ε is the counit.  Note that in the second rule we have identified    M  ⊗  K     tensor-product  M  K    M\otimes K   with    M    M   M\,   .  Examples   A coalgebra is a comodule over itself.    If M is a finite-dimensional module over a finite-dimensional K -algebra A , then the set of linear functions from A to K forms a coalgebra, and the set of linear functions from M to K forms a comodule over that coalgebra.    A graded vector space  V can be made into a comodule. Let I be the index set for the graded vector space, and let    C  I     subscript  C  I    C_{I}   be the vector space with basis    e  i     subscript  e  i    e_{i}   for    i  ∈  I      i  I    i\in I   . We turn    C  I     subscript  C  I    C_{I}   into a coalgebra and V into a    C  I     subscript  C  I    C_{I}   -comodule, as follows:   :# Let the comultiplication on    C  I     subscript  C  I    C_{I}   be given by     Δ   (   e  i   )    =    e  i   ⊗   e  i          normal-Δ   subscript  e  i     tensor-product   subscript  e  i    subscript  e  i      \Delta(e_{i})=e_{i}\otimes e_{i}   .  :# Let the counit on    C  I     subscript  C  I    C_{I}   be given by     ε   (   e  i   )    =  1        ε   subscript  e  i    1    \varepsilon(e_{i})=1   .  :# Let the map   ρ   ρ   \rho   on V be given by     ρ   (  v  )    =   ∑    v  i   ⊗   e  i           ρ  v      tensor-product   subscript  v  i    subscript  e  i       \rho(v)=\sum v_{i}\otimes e_{i}   , where    v  i     subscript  v  i    v_{i}   is the i -th homogeneous piece of   v   v   v   .  Rational comodule  If M is a (right) comodule over the coalgebra C , then M is a (left) module over the dual algebra C ∗ , but the converse is not true in general: a module over C ∗ is not necessarily a comodule over C . A rational comodule is a module over C ∗ which becomes a comodule over C in the natural way.  References        "  Category:Module theory  Category:Coalgebras
