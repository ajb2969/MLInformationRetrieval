   Prewellordering      Prewellordering   In set theory , a prewellordering is a binary relation    ≤     \leq   that is transitive , total , and wellfounded (more precisely, the relation    x  ≤   y  ∧  y   ≰  x        x    y  y     not-less-than-nor-greater-than    x     x\leq y\land y\nleq x   is wellfounded). In other words, if   ≤     \leq   is a prewellordering on a set   X   X   X   , and if we define   ∼   similar-to   \sim   by       x  ∼  y   ⇔   x  ≤   y  ∧  y   ≤  x      iff   similar-to  x  y       x    y  y        x      x\sim y\iff x\leq y\land y\leq x   then   ∼   similar-to   \sim   is an equivalence relation on   X   X   X   , and   ≤     \leq   induces a wellordering on the quotient     X  /  ∼     fragments  X   similar-to    X/\sim   . The order-type of this induced wellordering is an ordinal , referred to as the length of the prewellordering.  A norm on a set   X   X   X   is a map from   X   X   X   into the ordinals. Every norm induces a prewellordering; if    ϕ  :   X  →   O  r  d       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  X    O  r  d      \phi:X\to Ord   is a norm, the associated prewellordering is given by       x  ≤  y   ⇔    ϕ   (  x  )    ≤   ϕ   (  y  )        iff    x  y       ϕ  x     ϕ  y      x\leq y\iff\phi(x)\leq\phi(y)   Conversely, every prewellordering is induced by a unique regular norm (a norm    ϕ  :   X  →   O  r  d       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→  X    O  r  d      \phi:X\to Ord   is regular if, for any    x  ∈  X      x  X    x\in X   and any    α  <   ϕ   (  x  )        α    ϕ  x     \alpha<\phi(x)   , there is    y  ∈  X      y  X    y\in X   such that     ϕ   (  y  )    =  α        ϕ  y   α    \phi(y)=\alpha   ).  Prewellordering property  If   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   is a pointclass of subsets of some collection   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   of Polish spaces ,   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   closed under Cartesian product , and if   ≤     \leq   is a prewellordering of some subset   P   P   P   of some element   X   X   X   of   ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}   , then   ≤     \leq   is said to be a   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   - prewellordering of   P   P   P   if the relations and    ≤  *     superscript      \leq^{*}   are elements of   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   , where for     x  ,  y   ∈  X       x  y   X    x,y\in X   ,       x   <  *   y  ⇔  x  ∈  P  ∧   [  y  ∉  P  ∨   {  x  ≤  y  ∧  y  ≰  x  }   ]      fragments  x   superscript     y  iff  x   P    fragments  normal-[  y   P    fragments  normal-{  x   y   y  not-less-than-or-equals  x  normal-}   normal-]     x<^{*}y\iff x\in P\land[y\notin P\lor\{x\leq y\land y\not\leq x\}]         x   ≤  *   y  ⇔  x  ∈  P  ∧   [  y  ∉  P  ∨  x  ≤  y  ]      fragments  x   superscript     y  iff  x   P    fragments  normal-[  y   P   x   y  normal-]     x\leq^{*}y\iff x\in P\land[y\notin P\lor x\leq y]         𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   is said to have the prewellordering property if every set in   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   admits a   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   -prewellordering.  The prewellordering property is related to the stronger scale property ; in practice, many pointclasses having the prewellordering property also have the scale property, which allows drawing stronger conclusions.  Examples       𝚷  1  1      subscript   superscript  𝚷  1   1    \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{1}_{1}\,   and    𝚺  2  1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1   2    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{2}   both have the prewellordering property; this is provable in ZFC alone. Assuming sufficient large cardinals , for every    n  ∈  ω      n  ω    n\in\omega   ,    𝚷    2  n   +  1   1     subscript   superscript  𝚷  1       2  n   1     \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{1}_{2n+1}   and    𝚺    2  n   +  2   1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1       2  n   2     \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{2n+2}   have the prewellordering property.  Consequences  Reduction  If   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   is an adequate pointclass with the prewellordering property, then it also has the reduction property : For any space    X  ∈  ℱ      X  ℱ    X\in\mathcal{F}   and any sets     A  ,  B   ⊆  X       A  B   X    A,B\subseteq X   ,   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   both in   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   , the union    A  ∪  B      A  B    A\cup B   may be partitioned into sets     A  *   ,    B  *        superscript  A     superscript  B      A^{*},B^{*}\,   , both in   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   , such that     A  *   ⊆  A       superscript  A    A    A^{*}\subseteq A   and     B  *   ⊆  B       superscript  B    B    B^{*}\subseteq B   .  Separation  If   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   is an adequate pointclass whose dual pointclass has the prewellordering property, then   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   has the separation property : For any space    X  ∈  ℱ      X  ℱ    X\in\mathcal{F}   and any sets     A  ,  B   ⊆  X       A  B   X    A,B\subseteq X   ,   A   A   A   and   B   B   B    disjoint sets both in   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   , there is a set    C  ⊆  X      C  X    C\subseteq X   such that both   C   C   C   and its complement     X  ∖  C      X  C    X\setminus C   are in   𝚪   𝚪   \boldsymbol{\Gamma}   , with    A  ⊆  C      A  C    A\subseteq C   and     B  ∩  C   =  ∅        B  C      B\cap C=\emptyset   .  For example,    𝚷  1  1     subscript   superscript  𝚷  1   1    \boldsymbol{\Pi}^{1}_{1}   has the prewellordering property, so    𝚺  1  1     subscript   superscript  𝚺  1   1    \boldsymbol{\Sigma}^{1}_{1}   has the separation property. This means that if   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are disjoint analytic subsets of some Polish space   X   X   X   , then there is a Borel subset   C   C   C   of   X   X   X   such that   C   C   C   includes   A   A   A   and is disjoint from   B   B   B   .
