Prewellordering

In set theory, a prewellordering is a binary relation

 
  that is transitive, total, and wellfounded (more precisely, the relation 
 
 
 
  is wellfounded). In other words, if 
 
 
 
  is a prewellordering on a set 
 
 
 
 
 , and if we define 
 
 
 
  by


 
  then 
 
 
 
  is an equivalence relation on 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
  induces a wellordering on the quotient

 
 . The order-type of this induced wellordering is an ordinal, referred to as the length of the prewellordering.
A norm on a set 
 
 
 
  is a map from 
 
 
 
  into the ordinals. Every norm induces a prewellordering; if 
 
 
 
  is a norm, the associated prewellordering is given by


 
  Conversely, every prewellordering is induced by a unique regular norm (a norm 
 
 
 
  is regular if, for any 
 
 
 
  and any 
 
 
 
 , there is 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
 ).
Prewellordering property
If 
 
 
 
  is a pointclass of subsets of some collection 
 
 
 
  of Polish spaces, 
 
 
 
  closed under Cartesian product, and if 
 
 
 
  is a prewellordering of some subset 
 
 
 
 
  of some element 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is said to be a 
 
 
 
 -prewellordering of 
 
 
 
 
  if the relations 










 
  is said to have the prewellordering property if every set in 
 
 
 
  admits a 
 
 
 
 -prewellordering.
The prewellordering property is related to the stronger scale property; in practice, many pointclasses having the prewellordering property also have the scale property, which allows drawing stronger conclusions.
Examples


 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  both have the prewellordering property; this is provable in ZFC alone. Assuming sufficient large cardinals, for every 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have the prewellordering property.
Consequences
Reduction
If 
 
 
 
  is an adequate pointclass with the prewellordering property, then it also has the reduction property: For any space 
 
 
 
 
  and any sets 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  both in 
 
 
 
 , the union 
 
 
 
 
  may be partitioned into sets 
 
 
 
 , both in 
 
 
 
 , such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Separation
If 
 
 
 
 
  is an adequate pointclass whose dual pointclass has the prewellordering property, then 
 
 
 
  has the separation property: For any space 
 
 
 
  and any sets 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
disjoint sets both in 
 
 
 
 , there is a set 
 
 
 
  such that both 
 
 
 
  and its complement

 
  are in 
 
 
 
 
 , with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
For example, 
 
 
 
  has the prewellordering property, so 
 
 
 
  has the separation property. This means that if 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are disjoint analytic subsets of some Polish space 
 
 
 
 , then there is a Borel subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 
  includes 
 
 
 
  and is disjoint from 
 
 
 
 .

Scale property
Graded poset â€“ a graded poset is analogous to a prewellordering with a norm, replacing a map to the ordinals with a map to the integers
