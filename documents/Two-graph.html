<h1>Two-graph</h1>
<hr/>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>, a <strong>two-graph</strong> is a set of (unordered) triples chosen from a finite <strong>vertex set</strong> <em>X</em>, such that every (unordered) quadruple from <em>X</em> contains an even number of triples of the two-graph. A <strong>regular</strong> two-graph has the property that every pair of vertices lies in the same number of triples of the two-graph. Two-graphs have been studied because of their connection with <a href="equiangular_lines" title="wikilink">equiangular lines</a> and, for regular two-graphs, <a href="strongly_regular_graph" title="wikilink">strongly regular graphs</a>, and also <a href="finite_group" title="wikilink">finite groups</a> because many regular two-graphs have interesting <a href="automorphism_group" title="wikilink">automorphism groups</a>.</p>

<p>A two-graph is not a graph and should not be confused with other objects called <strong>2-graphs</strong> in <a href="graph_theory" title="wikilink">graph theory</a>, such as <a href="regular_graph" title="wikilink">2-regular graphs</a>.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

<p>On the set of vertices {1,...,6} the following collection of unordered triples is a two-graph:</p>
<dl>
<dd>123  124  135  146  156  236  245  256  345  346
</dd>
</dl>

<p>This two-graph is a regular two-graph since each pair of distinct vertices appears together in exactly two triples.</p>

<p>Given a simple graph <em>G</em> = (<em>V</em>,<em>E</em>), the set of triples of the vertex set <em>V</em> whose induced subgraph has an odd number of edges forms a two-graph on the set <em>V</em>. Every two-graph can be represented in this way.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> This example is referred to as the standard construction of a two-graph from a simple graph.</p>

<p>As a more complex example, let <em>T</em> be a tree with edge set <em>E</em>. The set of all triples of <em>E</em> that are not contained in a path of <em>T</em> form a two-graph on the set <em>E</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="switching-and-graphs">Switching and graphs</h2>

<p><a href="file:Xyswitch.svg" title="wikilink">thumb|Switching {X,Y} in a graph</a> A two-graph is equivalent to a switching class of graphs and also to a (signed) switching class of <a href="signed_graph" title="wikilink">signed complete graphs</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Switching</strong> a set of vertices in a (simple) graph means reversing the adjacencies of each pair of vertices, one in the set and the other not in the set: thus the edge set is changed so that an adjacent pair becomes nonadjacent and a nonadjacent pair becomes adjacent. The edges whose endpoints are both in the set, or both not in the set, are not changed. Graphs are <strong>switching equivalent</strong> if one can be obtained from the other by switching. An equivalence class of graphs under switching is called a <strong>switching class</strong>. Switching was introduced by  and developed by Seidel; it has been called <strong>graph switching</strong> or <strong>Seidel switching</strong>, partly to distinguish it from switching of <a href="signed_graph" title="wikilink">signed graphs</a>.</p>

<p>In the standard construction of a two-graph from a simple graph given above, two graphs will yield the same two-graph if and only if they are equivalent under switching, that is, they are in the same switching class.</p>

<p>Let Γ be a two-graph on the set <em>X</em>. For any element <em>x</em> of <em>X</em>, define a graph with vertex set <em>X</em> having vertices <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> adjacent if and only if {<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>} is in Γ. In this graph, <em>x</em> will be an isolated vertex. This construction is reversible; given a simple graph <em>G</em>, adjoin a new element <em>x</em> to the set of vertices of <em>G</em> and define the two-graph whose triples are all the {<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>, <em>z</em>} where <em>y</em> and <em>z</em> are adjacent vertices in <em>G</em>. This two-graph is called the <em>extension</em> of <em>G</em> by <em>x</em> in <a href="block_design" title="wikilink">design theoretic language</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> In a given switching class of graphs of a regular two-graph, let Γ<sub><em>x</em></sub> be the unique graph having <em>x</em> as an isolated vertex (this always exists, just take any graph in the class and switch the open neighborhood of <em>x</em>) without the vertex <em>x</em>. That is, the two-graph is the extension of Γ<sub><em>x</em></sub> by <em>x</em>. In the first example above of a regular two-graph, Γ<sub><em>x</em></sub> is a 5-cycle for any choice of <em>x</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>To a graph <em>G</em> there corresponds a signed complete graph Σ on the same vertex set, whose edges are signed negative if in <em>G</em> and positive if not in <em>G</em>. Conversely, <em>G</em> is the subgraph of Σ that consists of all vertices and all negative edges. The two-graph of <em>G</em> can also be defined as the set of triples of vertices that support a negative triangle (a triangle with an odd number of negative edges) in Σ. Two signed complete graphs yield the same two-graph if and only if they are equivalent under switching.</p>

<p>Switching of <em>G</em> and of Σ are related: switching the same vertices in both yields a graph <em>H</em> and its corresponding signed complete graph.</p>
<h2 id="adjacency-matrix">Adjacency matrix</h2>

<p>The <strong>adjacency matrix</strong> of a two-graph is the <a href="signed_graph" title="wikilink">adjacency matrix</a> of the corresponding signed complete graph; thus it is <a href="symmetric_matrix" title="wikilink">symmetric</a>, is zero on the diagonal, and has entries ±1 off the diagonal. If <em>G</em> is the graph corresponding to the signed complete graph Σ, this matrix is called the <strong>(0, −1, 1)-adjacency matrix</strong> or <a href="Seidel_adjacency_matrix" title="wikilink">Seidel adjacency matrix</a> of <em>G</em>. The Seidel matrix has zero entries on the main diagonal, -1 entries for adjacent vertices and +1 entries for non-adjacent vertices.</p>

<p>If graphs <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> are in a same switching class, the multisets of eigenvalues of the two <a href="Seidel_adjacency_matrix" title="wikilink">Seidel adjacency matrices</a> of <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> coincide, since the matrices are similar.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>A two-graph on a set <em>V</em> is regular if and only if its adjacency matrix has just two distinct <a href="Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors" title="wikilink">eigenvalues</a> ρ<sub>1</sub> &gt; 0 &gt; ρ<sub>2</sub> say, where ρ<sub>1</sub>ρ<sub>2</sub> = 1 - |<em>V</em>|.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="equiangular-lines">Equiangular lines</h2>

<p>Every two-graph is equivalent to a set of lines in some dimensional <a href="euclidean_space" title="wikilink">euclidean space</a> each pair of which meet in the same angle. The set of lines constructed from a two graph on <em>n</em> vertices is obtained as follows. Let -ρ be the smallest <a href="Eigenvalues_and_eigenvectors" title="wikilink">eigenvalue</a> of the <a href="Seidel_adjacency_matrix" title="wikilink">Seidel adjacency matrix</a>, <em>A</em>, of the two-graph, and suppose that it has multiplicity <em>n</em> - <em>d</em>. Then the matrix  is positive semi-definite of rank <em>d</em> and thus can be represented as the <a href="Gram_matrix" title="wikilink">Gram matrix</a> of the inner products of <em>n</em> vectors in euclidean <em>d</em>-space. As these vectors have the same <a href="Norm_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">norm</a> (namely, 

<math display="inline" id="Two-graph:0">
 <semantics>
  <msqrt>
   <mi>ρ</mi>
  </msqrt>
  <annotation-xml encoding="MathML-Content">
   <apply>

    <ci>ρ</ci>
   </apply>
  </annotation-xml>
  <annotation encoding="application/x-tex">

 </semantics>
</math>

) and mutual inner products ±1, any pair of the <em>n</em> lines spanned by them meet in the same angle φ where cos φ = 1/ρ. Conversely, any set of non-orthogonal equiangular lines in a euclidean space can give rise to a two-graph (see <a href="equiangular_lines" title="wikilink">equiangular lines</a> for the construction).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>With the notation as above, the maximum cardinality <em>n</em> satisfies <em>n</em> ≤ <em>d</em>(ρ<sup>2</sup> - 1)/(ρ<sup>2</sup> - <em>d</em>) and the bound is achieved if and only if the two-graph is regular.</p>
<h2 id="strongly-regular-graphs">Strongly regular graphs</h2>

<p>The two-graphs on <em>X</em> consisting of all possible triples of <em>X</em> and no triples of <em>X</em> are regular two-graphs and are considered to be <em>trivial</em> two-graphs.</p>

<p>For non-trivial two-graphs on the set <em>X</em>, the two-graph is regular if and only if for some <em>x</em> in <em>X</em> the graph Γ<sub><em>x</em></sub> is a <a href="strongly_regular_graph" title="wikilink">strongly regular graph</a> with <em>k</em> = 2μ (the degree of any vertex is twice the number of vertices adjacent to both of any non-adjacent pair of vertices). If this condition holds for one <em>x</em> in <em>X</em>, it holds for all the elements of <em>X</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>It follows that a non-trivial regular two-graph has an even number of points.</p>

<p>If <em>G</em> is a regular graph whose two-graph extension is Γ having <em>n</em> points, then Γ is a regular two-graph if and only if <em>G</em> is a strongly regular graph with eigenvalues <em>k</em>, <em>r</em> and <em>s</em> satisfying <em>n</em> = 2(<em>k</em> - <em>r</em>) or <em>n</em> = 2(<em>k</em> - <em>s</em>).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>
