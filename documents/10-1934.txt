   5-dehydro-2-deoxyphosphogluconate aldolase      5-dehydro-2-deoxyphosphogluconate aldolase   In enzymology , a 5-dehydro-2-deoxyphosphogluconate aldolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5-dehydro-2-deoxy-D-gluconate 6-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycerone phosphate + malonate semialdehyde   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 5-dehydro-2-deoxy-D-gluconate 6-phosphate , and two products , glycerone phosphate and malonate semialdehyde .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the aldehyde-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5-dehydro-2-deoxy-D-gluconate-6-phosphate malonate-semialdehyde-lyase (glycerone-phosphate-forming) . Other names in common use include phospho-5-keto-2-deoxygluconate aldolase , 5-dehydro-2-deoxy-D-gluconate-6-phosphate , and malonate-semialdehyde-lyase .
