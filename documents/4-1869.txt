   N-vector model      N-vector model   The ''' n -vector model''' or O( n ) model has been introduced by H. Eugene Stanley  1 is one of the many highly simplified models in the branch of physics known as statistical mechanics . In the n -vector model, n -component, unit length, classical spins     ùê¨  i     subscript  ùê¨  i    \mathbf{s}_{i}   are placed on the vertices of a lattice . The Hamiltonian of the n-vector model is given by:     ‚ãÖ   normal-‚ãÖ   \cdot     where the sum runs over all pairs of neighboring spins    n  =  0      n  0    n=0   and    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   denotes the standard Euclidean inner product. Special cases of the n-vector model are:      n  =  2      n  2    n=2   || The Self-Avoiding Walks (SAW)      n  =  3      n  3    n=3   || The Ising model      n  =  4      n  4    n=4   || The XY model      n  =  0      n  0    n=0   || The Heisenberg model     n   n   n   || Toy model for the Higgs sector of the Standard Model  The general mathematical formalism used to describe and solve the n -vector model and certain generalizations are developed in the article on the Potts model .
