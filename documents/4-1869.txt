N-vector model

The ''' n-vector model''' or O(n) model has been introduced by H. Eugene Stanley 1 is one of the many highly simplified models in the branch of physics known as statistical mechanics. In the n-vector model, n-component, unit length, classical spins

 
  are placed on the vertices of a lattice. The Hamiltonian of the n-vector model is given by:



where the sum runs over all pairs of neighboring spins 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denotes the standard Euclidean inner product. Special cases of the n-vector model are:


 
  || The Self-Avoiding Walks (SAW)


 
  || The Ising model


 
  || The XY model


 
  || The Heisenberg model


 
  || Toy model for the Higgs sector of the Standard Model
The general mathematical formalism used to describe and solve the n-vector model and certain generalizations are developed in the article on the Potts model.
