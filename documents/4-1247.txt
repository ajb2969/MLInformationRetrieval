   Multiplication operator      Multiplication operator   In operator theory , a multiplication operator is an operator T defined on some vector space of functions and whose value at a function φ is given by multiplication by a fixed function f . That is,        T   (  φ  )    (  x  )    =   f   (  x  )   φ   (  x  )           T  φ  x     f  x  φ  x     T(\varphi)(x)=f(x)\varphi(x)\quad     for all φ in the function space and all x in the domain of φ (which is the same as the domain of f ).  This type of operators is often contrasted with composition operators . Multiplication operators generalize the notion of operator given by a diagonal matrix . More precisely, one of the results of operator theory is a spectral theorem , which states that every self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space is unitarily equivalent to a multiplication operator on an L 2 space .  Example  Consider the Hilbert space  X = L 2 [−1, 3] of complex -valued square integrable functions on the interval [−1, 3]. Define the operator:        T   (  φ  )    (  x  )    =    x  2   φ   (  x  )           T  φ  x      superscript  x  2   φ  x     T(\varphi)(x)=x^{2}\varphi(x)\quad   for any function φ in X . This will be a self-adjoint  bounded linear operator with norm 9. Its spectrum will be the interval [0, 9] (the range of the function x → x 2 defined on [−1, 3]). Indeed, for any complex number λ, the operator T -λ is given by       (  T  -  λ  )    (  φ  )    (  x  )   =   (   x  2   -  λ  )   φ   (  x  )   .     fragments   fragments  normal-(  T   λ  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  φ  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)     fragments  normal-(   superscript  x  2    λ  normal-)   φ   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)   normal-.     (T-\lambda)(\varphi)(x)=(x^{2}-\lambda)\varphi(x).\quad   It is invertible  if and only if λ is not in [0, 9], and then its inverse is          (   T  -  λ   )    -  1     (  φ  )    (  x  )    =    1    x  2   -  λ    φ   (  x  )            superscript    T  λ     1    φ  x       1     superscript  x  2   λ    φ  x     (T-\lambda)^{-1}(\varphi)(x)=\frac{1}{x^{2}-\lambda}\varphi(x)\quad     which is another multiplication operator.  This can be easily generalized to characterizing the norm and spectrum of a multiplication operator on any Lp space .
