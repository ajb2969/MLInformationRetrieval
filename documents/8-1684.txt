   Distance-regular graph      Distance-regular graph   In mathematics , a distance-regular graph is a regular  graph such that for any two vertices v and w , the number of vertices at distance  j from v and at distance k from w depends only upon j , k , and i = d(v, w) .  By considering the special case k = 1 , one sees that in a distance-regular graph, for any two vertices v and w at distance i , the number of neighbors of w that are at distance j from v is the same. Conversely, it turns out that this special case implies the full definition of distance-regularity. 1 Therefore, an equivalent definition is that a distance-regular graph is a regular graph for which there exist integers b i ,c i ,i=0,...,d such that for any two vertices x,y with y in G i (x), there are exactly b i neighbors of y in G i-1 (x) and c i neighbors of y in G i+1 (x), where G i (x) is the set of vertices y of G with d(x,y)=i (Brouwer et al., p. 434). The array of integers characterizing a distance-regular graph is known as its intersection array.  Every distance-transitive graph is distance regular. Indeed, distance-regular graphs were introduced as a combinatorial generalization of distance-transitive graphs, having the numerical regularity properties of the latter without necessarily having a large automorphism group .  A distance-regular graph with diameter 2 is strongly regular , and conversely (unless the graph is disconnected ).  Intersection numbers  It is usual to use the following notation for a distance-regular graph G . The number of vertices is n . The number of neighbors of w (that is, vertices adjacent to w ) whose distance from v is i , i + 1, and i − 1 is denoted by a i , b i , and c i , respectively; these are the intersection numbers of G . Obviously, a 0 = 0, c 0 = 0, and b 0 equals k , the degree of any vertex. If G has finite diameter, then d denotes the diameter and we have b d = 0. Also we have that a i +b i +c i = k  The numbers a i , b i , and c i are often displayed in a three-line array       {     -     c  1     ⋯     c   d  -  1       c  d        a  0      a  1     ⋯     a   d  -  1       a  d        b  0      b  1     ⋯     b   d  -  1      -     }   ,         subscript  c  1   normal-⋯   subscript  c    d  1     subscript  c  d      subscript  a  0    subscript  a  1   normal-⋯   subscript  a    d  1     subscript  a  d      subscript  b  0    subscript  b  1   normal-⋯   subscript  b    d  1         \left\{\begin{matrix}-&c_{1}&\cdots&c_{d-1}&c_{d}\\
 a_{0}&a_{1}&\cdots&a_{d-1}&a_{d}\\
 b_{0}&b_{1}&\cdots&b_{d-1}&-\end{matrix}\right\},   called the intersection array of G . They may also be formed into a tridiagonal matrix       B  :=   (      a  0      b  0     0    ⋯    0    0       c  1      a  1      b  1     ⋯    0    0      0     c  2      a  2     ⋯    0    0      ⋮    ⋮    ⋮       ⋮    ⋮      0    0    0    ⋯     a   d  -  1       b   d  -  1        0    0    0    ⋯     c  d      a  d      )    ,     assign  B     subscript  a  0    subscript  b  0   0  normal-⋯  0  0     subscript  c  1    subscript  a  1    subscript  b  1   normal-⋯  0  0    0   subscript  c  2    subscript  a  2   normal-⋯  0  0    normal-⋮  normal-⋮  normal-⋮  absent  normal-⋮  normal-⋮    0  0  0  normal-⋯   subscript  a    d  1     subscript  b    d  1      0  0  0  normal-⋯   subscript  c  d    subscript  a  d       B:=\begin{pmatrix}a_{0}&b_{0}&0&\cdots&0&0\\
 c_{1}&a_{1}&b_{1}&\cdots&0&0\\
 0&c_{2}&a_{2}&\cdots&0&0\\
 \vdots&\vdots&\vdots&&\vdots&\vdots\\
 0&0&0&\cdots&a_{d-1}&b_{d-1}\\
 0&0&0&\cdots&c_{d}&a_{d}\end{pmatrix},   called the intersection matrix .  Distance adjacency matrices  Suppose G is a connected distance-regular graph. For each distance i = 1, ..., d , we can form a graph G i in which vertices are adjacent if their distance in G equals i . Let A i be the adjacency matrix of G i . For instance, A 1 is the adjacency matrix A of G . Also, let A 0 = I , the identity matrix. This gives us d + 1 matrices A 0 , A 1 , ..., A d , called the distance matrices of G . Their sum is the matrix J in which every entry is 1. There is an important product formula:        A   A  i    =     a  i    A  i    +    b  i    A   i  +  1     +    c  i    A   i  -  1       .        A   subscript  A  i         subscript  a  i    subscript  A  i       subscript  b  i    subscript  A    i  1        subscript  c  i    subscript  A    i  1        AA_{i}=a_{i}A_{i}+b_{i}A_{i+1}+c_{i}A_{i-1}.   From this formula it follows that each A i is a polynomial function of A , of degree i , and that A satisfies a polynomial of degree d + 1. Furthermore, A has exactly d + 1 distinct eigenvalues , namely the eigenvalues of the intersection matrix B ,of which the largest is k , the degree.  The distance matrices span a vector subspace of the vector space of all n × n real matrices. It is a remarkable fact that the product A i  A j of any two distance matrices is a linear combination of the distance matrices:         A  i    A  j    =    ∑   k  =  0   d     p   i  j   k    A  k      .         subscript  A  i    subscript  A  j      superscript   subscript     k  0    d      superscript   subscript  p    i  j    k    subscript  A  k       A_{i}A_{j}=\sum_{k=0}^{d}p_{ij}^{k}A_{k}.   This means that the distance matrices generate an association scheme . The theory of association schemes is central to the study of distance-regular graphs. For instance, the fact that A i is a polynomial function of A is a fact about association schemes.  Examples   Complete graphs are distance regular with diameter 1 and degree v −1.  Cycles  C 2 d +1 of odd length are distance regular with k = 2 and diameter d . The intersection numbers a i = 0, b i = 1, and c i = 1, except for the usual special cases (see above) and c d = 2.  All Moore graphs , in particular the Petersen graph and the Hoffman-Singleton graph , are distance regular.  The Wells graph and Sylvester graph .  Strongly regular graphs are distance regular.  The odd graphs are distance regular.  The collinearity graph of every regular near polygon is distance-regular.   Cubic distance-regular graphs  There are 13 distance-regular cubic graphs : K 4 (or tetrahedron ), K 3,3 , the Petersen graph , the cube , the Heawood graph , the Pappus graph , the Coxeter graph , the Tutte–Coxeter graph , the dodecahedron , the Desargues graph , Tutte 12-cage , the Biggs–Smith graph , and the Foster graph .
