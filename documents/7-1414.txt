   Effective renal plasma flow      Effective renal plasma flow     Effective renal plasma flow (eRPF) is a measure used in renal physiology 1 to calculate renal plasma flow (RPF) and hence estimate renal function .       e  R  P  F   =     R  P  F   ×  e   x  t  r  a  c  t  i  o  n  r  a  t  i  o         e  R  P  F         R  P  F   e   x  t  r  a  c  t  i  o  n  r  a  t  i  o     eRPF=RPF\times extractionratio     Where extraction ratio is the ratio of compound entering the kidney that is excreted into the final urine.  When using a compound with an extraction ratio near 1, such as para-aminohippurate (PAH), eRPF approximates RPF. Therefore, PAH clearance can be used to estimate RPF.
