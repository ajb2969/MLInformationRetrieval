RST model

The Russo–Susskind–Thorlacius model1 or RST model in short is a modification of the CGHS model to take care of conformal anomalies. In the CGHS model, if we include Faddeev-Popov ghosts to gauge-fix diffeomorphisms in the conformal gauge, they contribute an anomaly of -24. Each matter field contributes an anomaly of 1. So, unless N=24, we will have gravitational anomalies. To the CGHS action


 
 , the following term


 
  is added, where κ is either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  depending upon whether or not ghosts are considered. The nonlocal term leads to nonlocality. In the conformal gauge,

It might appear as if the theory is local in the conformal gauge, but this overlooks the fact that the Raychaudhuri equations are still nonlocal.
