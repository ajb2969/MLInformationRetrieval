   Young stellar object      Young stellar object   (Figure)  Small young stellar object known as SSTC2D J033038.2+303212, located in the constellation of Perseus . 1   Young stellar object ( YSO ) denotes a star in its early stage of evolution.  This class consists of two groups of objects: protostars and pre–main-sequence stars .  Classification by mass  Sometimes they are divided by mass – massive YSO (MYSO), intermediate mass YSO and brown dwarfs .  Classification by spectral energy distribution  YSO are usually classified using criteria based on the slope of their SED , introduced by Lada C.J. in 1987. He proposed three classes (I, II and III), based on the values of intervals of spectral index     α    α   \alpha\,   :      α  =    d   log   (   λ   F  λ    )      d   log   (  λ  )          α      d      λ   subscript  F  λ        d    λ       \alpha=\frac{d\log(\lambda F_{\lambda})}{d\log(\lambda)}   .  Here    λ    λ   \lambda\,   is wavelength, and    F  λ     subscript  F  λ    F_{\lambda}   is flux density.  The    α    α   \alpha\,   is calculated in the wavelength interval of 2.2–20    μ  m      μ  m    {\mu}m   (near- and mid- infrared region). Later Greene et al. in 1994 added a fourth class of "flat spectrum" class sources. In 1993 Andre et al. discovered class 0—objects with strong submillimeter emission, but very faint at    λ  <   10  μ  m       λ    10  μ  m     {\lambda}<10{\mu}m   .   Class 0 sources – undetectable at    λ  <   20  μ  m       λ    20  μ  m     {\lambda}<20{\mu}m     Class I sources have    α  >  0.3      α  0.3    {\alpha}>0.3     Flat spectrum sources have    0.3  >  α  >   -  0.3         0.3  α         0.3      0.3>{\alpha}>-0.3     Class II sources have     -  0.3   >  α  >   -  1.6           0.3   α         1.6      -0.3>{\alpha}>-1.6     Class III sources have    α  <   -  1.6       α    1.6     {\alpha}<-1.6      This classification schema roughly reflects evolutionary sequence. It is believed that most deeply embedded Class 0 sources evolve towards Class I stage dissipating their circumstellar envelopes . Eventually they become optically visible on the stellar birthline as pre–main sequence stars.  Characteristics  YSO are also associated with early star evolution phenomena: jets and bipolar outflows , masers , Herbig–Haro objects , protoplanetary disks (circumstellar disks or proplyds).
