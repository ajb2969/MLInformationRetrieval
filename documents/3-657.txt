   Normal function      Normal function   In axiomatic set theory , a function f : Ord → Ord is called normal (or a normal function ) iff it is continuous (with respect to the order topology ) and strictly monotonically increasing . This is equivalent to the following two conditions:   For every limit ordinal γ (i.e. γ is neither zero nor a successor), f (γ) = sup { f (ν) : ν < γ}.  For all ordinals α < β, f (α) < f (β).   Examples  A simple normal function is given by f (α) = 1 + α (see ordinal arithmetic ). But f (α) = α + 1 is not normal. If β is a fixed ordinal, then the functions f (α) = β + α, f (α) = β × α (for β ≥ 1), and f (α) = β α (for β ≥ 2) are all normal.  More important examples of normal functions are given by the aleph numbers      f   (  α  )    =   ℵ  α         f  α    subscript  normal-ℵ  α     f(\alpha)=\aleph_{\alpha}   which connect ordinal and cardinal numbers , and by the beth numbers      f   (  α  )    =   ℶ  α         f  α    subscript  normal-ℶ  α     f(\alpha)=\beth_{\alpha}   .  Properties  If f is normal, then for any ordinal α,   f (α) ≥ α. 1    Proof : If not, choose γ minimal such that f (γ)  Notes  References    .
