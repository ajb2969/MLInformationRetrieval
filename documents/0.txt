   Bendixson–Dulac theorem      Bendixson–Dulac theorem   In mathematics , the Bendixson–Dulac theorem on dynamical systems states that if there exists a    C  1     superscript  C  1    C^{1}    function     φ   (  x  ,  y  )       φ   x  y     \varphi(x,y)   (called the Dulac function) such that the expression        ∂   (   φ  f   )     ∂  x    +    ∂   (   φ  g   )     ∂  y              φ  f      x          φ  g      y      \frac{\partial(\varphi f)}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial(\varphi g)}{\partial y}     has the same sign (     ≠  0      absent  0    \neq 0   ) almost everywhere in a simply connected region of the plane, then the plane autonomous system         d  x    d  t    =   f   (  x  ,  y  )     ,          d  x     d  t      f   x  y      \frac{dx}{dt}=f(x,y),           d  y    d  t    =   g   (  x  ,  y  )            d  y     d  t      g   x  y      \frac{dy}{dt}=g(x,y)     has no periodic solutions lying entirely within the region. 1 "Almost everywhere" means everywhere except possibly in a set of measure 0, such as a point or line.  The theorem was first established by Swedish mathematician Ivar Bendixson in 1901 and further refined by French mathematician Henri Dulac in 1933 using Green's theorem .  Proof  Without loss of generality, let there exist a function    φ   (  x  ,  y  )       φ   x  y     \varphi(x,y)   such that         ∂   (   φ  f   )     ∂  x    +    ∂   (   φ  g   )     ∂  y     >  0              φ  f      x          φ  g      y     0    \frac{\partial(\varphi f)}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial(\varphi g)}{\partial y}>0     in simply connected region   R   R   R   . Let   C   C   C   be a closed trajectory of the plane autonomous system in   R   R   R   . Let   D   D   D   be the interior of   C   C   C   . Then by Green's Theorem ,        ∬  D     (     ∂   (   φ  f   )     ∂  x    +    ∂   (   φ  g   )     ∂  y     )   d  x  d  y    =     ∮  C   -   φ  g  d  x    +   φ  f  d  y          subscript  double-integral  D             φ  f      x          φ  g      y     d  x  d  y         subscript  contour-integral  C     φ  g  d  x      φ  f  d  y      \iint_{D}{\left(\frac{\partial(\varphi f)}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial(\varphi g%
 )}{\partial y}\right)dxdy}=\oint_{C}{-\varphi gdx+\varphi fdy}           =    ∮  C    φ   (    -    y  ˙   d  x    +    x  ˙   d  y    )      .      absent    subscript  contour-integral  C     φ         normal-˙  y   d  x       normal-˙  x   d  y        =\oint_{C}{\varphi\left(-\dot{y}dx+\dot{x}dy\right)}.     But on   C   C   C   ,     d  x   =    x  ˙   d  t         d  x      normal-˙  x   d  t     dx=\dot{x}dt   and     d  y   =    y  ˙   d  t         d  y      normal-˙  y   d  t     dy=\dot{y}dt   , so the integral evaluates to 0. This is a contradiction, so there can be no such closed trajectory   C   C   C   .  References  "  Category:Differential equations  Category:Theorems in dynamical systems     ↩
