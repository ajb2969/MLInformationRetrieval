Thiol sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a thiol sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + a thiol 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + an S-alkyl thiosulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and thiol, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and S-alkyl thiosulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:thiol S-sulfotransferase. Other names in common use include phosphoadenylylsulfate-thiol sulfotransferase, PAPS sulfotransferase, and adenosine 3'-phosphate 5'-sulphatophosphate sulfotransferase.
