3,4-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3,4-dihydroxyphthalate 
 
 
 
  3,4-dihydroxybenzoate + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate, and two products, 3,4-dihydroxybenzoate and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate carboxy-lyase (3,4-dihydroxybenzoate-forming). This enzyme is also called 3,4-dihydroxyphthalate carboxy-lyase.
