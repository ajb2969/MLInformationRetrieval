   Signature (topology)      Signature (topology)   In the mathematical field of topology , the signature is an integer invariant which is defined for an oriented manifold  M of dimension d =4 k  divisible by four ( doubly even -dimensional).  This invariant of a manifold has been studied in detail, starting with Rokhlin's theorem for 4-manifolds.  Definition  Given a connected and oriented manifold M of dimension 4 k , the cup product gives rise to a quadratic form  Q on the 'middle' real cohomology group   H 2 k ( M , Z ).   The basic identity for the cup product       Œ±  p   ‚å£   Œ≤  q   =    (  -  1  )    p  q     (   Œ≤  q   ‚å£   Œ±  p   )      fragments   superscript  Œ±  p   normal-‚å£   superscript  Œ≤  q     superscript   fragments  normal-(   1  normal-)     p  q     fragments  normal-(   superscript  Œ≤  q   normal-‚å£   superscript  Œ±  p   normal-)     \alpha^{p}\smile\beta^{q}=(-1)^{pq}(\beta^{q}\smile\alpha^{p})     shows that with p = q = 2 k the product is symmetric . It takes values in   H 4 k ( M , Z ).   If we assume also that M is compact , Poincar√© duality identifies this with   H 0 ( M , Z ),   which can be identified with Z . Therefore cup product, under these hypotheses, does give rise to a symmetric bilinear form on H 2 k ( M , Z ); and therefore to a quadratic form Q . The form Q is non-degenerate due to Poincar√© duality, as it pairs non-degenerately with itself. More generally, the signature can be defined in this way for any general compact polyhedron with 4n -dimensional Poincar√© duality.  The signature of M is by definition the signature of Q , an ordered triple according to its definition. If M is not connected, its signature is defined to be the sum of the signatures of its connected components.  Other dimensions  If M has dimension not divisible by 4, its signature is usually defined to be 0. There are alternative generalization in L-theory : the signature can be interpreted as the 4 k -dimensional (simply-connected) symmetric L-group     L   4  k    ,     superscript  L    4  k     L^{4k},   or as the 4 k -dimensional quadratic L-group     L   4  k    ,     subscript  L    4  k     L_{4k},   and these invariants do not always vanish for other dimensions. The Kervaire invariant is a mod 2 (i.e., an element of    ùêô  /  2      ùêô  2    \mathbf{Z}/2   ) for framed manifolds of dimension 4 k +2 (the quadratic L-group    L    4  k   +  2      subscript  L      4  k   2     L_{4k+2}   ), while the de Rham invariant is a mod 2 invariant of manifolds of dimension 4 k +1 (the symmetric L-group    L    4  k   +  1      superscript  L      4  k   1     L^{4k+1}   ); the other dimensional L-groups vanish.  Kervaire invariant  When    d  =    4  k   +  2   =   2   (    2  k   +  1   )          d      4  k   2          2      2  k   1       d=4k+2=2(2k+1)   is twice an odd integer ( singly even ), the same construction gives rise to an antisymmetric bilinear form . Such forms do not have a signature invariant; if they are non-degenerate, any two such forms are equivalent. However, if one takes a quadratic refinement of the form, which occurs if one has a framed manifold , then the resulting Œµ-quadratic forms need not be equivalent, being distinguished by the Arf invariant . The resulting invariant of a manifold is called the Kervaire invariant .  Properties  Ren√© Thom (1954) showed that the signature of a manifold is a cobordism invariant, and in particular is given by some linear combination of its Pontryagin numbers. Friedrich Hirzebruch (1954) found an explicit expression for this linear combination as the L genus of the manifold. William Browder (1962) proved that a simply-connected compact polyhedron with 4 n -dimensional Poincar√© duality is homotopy equivalent to a manifold if and only if its signature satisfies the expression of the Hirzebruch signature theorem .
