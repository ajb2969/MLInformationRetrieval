   AEX index      AEX index   The AEX index , derived from Amsterdam Exchange index , is a stock market index composed of Dutch  companies that trade on NYSE Euronext Amsterdam , 1 formerly known as the Amsterdam Stock Exchange . Started in 1983, the index is composed of a maximum of 25 of the most actively traded securities on the exchange. It is one of the main national indices of the stock exchange group NYSE Euronext 2 alongside Brussels' BEL20 , Paris's CAC 40 and Lisbon 's PSI-20 .  History  The AEX started from a base level of 100 index points on 3 January 1983 (a corresponding value of 45.378 is used for historic comparisons due to the adoption of the Euro ). 3 The index's peak to date is 703.18, reached on 5 September 2000 at the height of the dot-com bubble . 4 The index value more than halved over the following three years before recovering in line with most global financial markets.  The AEX index enjoyed its second largest one-day loss on September 29, 2008, when the index closed down almost 9%. The decade between 1998 and 2008 has been bad for the AEX index, as it has been the worst performing stock index except for the OMX Iceland 15 . 5 The preceding years were a lot better compared to the rest of the world.  Rules  Selection  As of 2011, the AEX index composition is reviewed four times a year - a full "annual" review in March and interim "quarterly" reviews in June, September and December. Any changes made as a result of the reviews take effect on the third Friday of the month. 6 Previously reviews were held in March and September only. 7 Prior to 2008, index changes were made only annually in March.  At the main March review date, the 23 companies listed on Euronext Amsterdam's regulated market with the highest share turnover (in Euros ) over the previous year are admitted to the index. 8 Of the companies ranked between 24th and 27th, a further two are selected with preference given to existing constituents of the index. Companies which have fewer than 25% of shares considered free float on Euronext Amsterdam are, however, ineligible for inclusion. 9 Unlike some other European benchmark equity indices (such as the OMXS30 ), if a company has more than one class of shares traded on the exchange, only the most actively traded of these will be accepted into the AEX. 10 If a company or companies are removed from the index due to delisting , acquisition or another reason, no replacements are made until the next review date. 11  At the three interim reviews in June, September and December, no changes are made to the AEX unless either the index has seen one or more constituents removed, or a non-constituent possesses a share turnover ranked 15th or higher overall over the previous 12 months. 12 If vacancies are to be filled, the highest-ranking non-AEX companies are selected to join the index. 13  Weighting  The AEX is a capitalization-weighted index . At each main annual review, the index weightings of companies in the index are capped at 15%, 14 but range freely with share price subsequently. The index weights are calculated with respect to the closing prices of the relevant companies on March 1. At the interim reviews, weightings after adjustment are left as close as possible to those of the previous day and are not re-capped. 15  Calculation  The index comprises a basket of shares, the numbers of which are based on the constituent weights and index value at the time of readjustment. The value of the index at any given time, I t , is calculated using the following formula: 16      I  t   =      ∑   i  =  1   N       Q   i  ,  t       F   i  ,  t       f   i  ,  t       C   i  ,  t         d  t          subscript  I  t       superscript   subscript     i  1    N      subscript  Q   i  t     subscript  F   i  t     subscript  f   i  t     subscript  C   i  t       subscript  d  t      I_{t}=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^{N}Q_{i,t}\,F_{i,t}\,f_{i,t}\,C_{i,t}\,}{d_{t}\,}     with t the day of calculation; N the number of constituent shares in the index (usually 25); Q i,t the number of shares of company i on day t ; F i,t the free float factor of share i ; f i,t the capping factor of share i (exactly 1 for all companies not subject to the 15% cap); C i,t the price of share i on day t ; and d t the index divisor (a factor calculated from the base capitalisation of the index, which is updated to reflect corporate actions and other index changes.  Composition  The index is composed of the following listings as of the quarterly interim review effective 20 June 2011, when Wereldhave was removed from the index to bring the number of constituents down to 25 ( TNT N.V. having split into PostNL and TNT Express during the previous quarter). 17 The September and December 2011 reviews saw no changes to the index. Since 24 September 2012, DE Master Blenders is part of the listing, taking the place of TomTom , which is downgraded to the AMX index 18 On 6 June 2013 Aperam moved to the AMX index and Gemalto entered the AEX. 19 On 23 September 2013 Ziggo replaced D.E. Master Blenders in the AEX. 20       Company   ICB Sector   Ticker symbol   Index weighting (%)       Aegon   life insurance    2.85     Ahold   food retailers and wholesalers    4.06     Air France-KLM   airlines    0.99     Akzo Nobel   specialty chemicals    4.01     ArcelorMittal   iron and steel    7.09     ASML   semiconductors    3.91     Boskalis   heavy construction    0.77     Corio   retail REITs    1.53     DSM   specialty chemicals    2.83     Fugro   oil equipment and services    1.25     Gemalto 21   software   GTO 22   2.06 23     Heineken   brewers    3.88     ING Group   life insurance    11.64     KPN   fixed line telecommunications    5.66     Philips   Consumer Electronics    6.51     PostNL   delivery services    0.84     Randstad Holding   business training and employment agencies    1.31     Reed Elsevier   publishing    2.38     Royal Dutch Shell   integrated oil and gas    15.59     SBM Offshore   oil equipment and services    1.10     TNT Express   delivery services    1.01     Unibail-Rodamco   retail REITs    5.24     Unilever   food products    13.36     Wolters Kluwer   publishing    1.62     Ziggo 24   telecommunications   ZIGGO   1.27       - Weightings accurate on 22 June 2011.
