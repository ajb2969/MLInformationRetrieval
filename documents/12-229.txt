Almost Mathieu operator

In mathematical physics, the almost Mathieu operator arises in the study of the quantum Hall effect. It is given by



acting as a self-adjoint operator on the Hilbert space 
 
 
 
 . Here 
 
 
 
  are parameters. In pure mathematics, its importance comes from the fact of being one of the best-understood examples of an ergodic Schrödinger operator. For example, three problems (now all solved) of Barry Simon's fifteen problems about Schrödinger operators "for the twenty-first century" featured the almost Mathieu operator.1
For 
 
 
 
 , the almost Mathieu operator is sometimes called Harper's equation.
The spectral type
If 
 
 
 
  is a rational number, then 
 
 
 
  is a periodic operator and by Floquet theory its spectrum is purely absolutely continuous.
Now to the case when 
 
 
 
  is irrational. Since the transformation 
 
 
 
  is minimal, it follows that the spectrum of 
 
 
 
  does not depend on 
 
 
 
 . On the other hand, by ergodicity, the supports of absolutely continuous, singular continuous, and pure point parts of the spectrum are almost surely independent of 
 
 
 
 . It is now known, that

For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  has surely purely absolutely continuous spectrum. 2 (This was one of Simon's problems.)
For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  has almost surely purely singular continuous spectrum.3 (It is not known whether eigenvalues can exist for exceptional parameters.)
For 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  has almost surely pure point spectrum and exhibits Anderson localization.4 (It is known that almost surely can not be replaced by surely.)56

That the spectral measures are singular when 
 
 
 
  follows (through the work of Last and Simon) 7 from the lower bound on the Lyapunov exponent

 
  given by



This lower bound was proved independently by Avron, Simon and Michael Herman, after an earlier almost rigorous argument of Aubry and André. In fact, when 
 
 
 
  belongs to the spectrum, the inequality becomes an equality (the Aubry-André formula), proved by Jean Bourgain and Svetlana Jitomirskaya.8

Hofstadter's Butterfly

Another striking characteristic of the almost Mathieu operator is that its spectrum is a Cantor set for all irrational 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This was shown by Avila and Jitomirskaya solving the by-then famous "Ten Martini Problem"9 (also one of Simon's problems) after several earlier results (including generically10 and almost surely11 with respect to the parameters).
Furthermore, the measure of the spectrum of the almost Mathieu operator is known to be



for all 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
  this means that the spectrum has zero measure (this was first proposed by Douglas Hofstadter and later became one of Simon's problems12). For 
 
 
 
 , the formula was discovered numerically by Aubry and André and proved by Jitomirskaya and Krasovsky.
The study of the spectrum for 
 
 
 
  leads to the Hofstadter's butterfly, where the spectrum is shown as a set.
