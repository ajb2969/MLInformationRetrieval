Hund's cases

In rotational-vibrational and electronic spectroscopy of diatomic molecules, Hund's coupling cases are idealized cases where specific terms appearing in the molecular Hamiltonian and involving couplings between angular momenta are assumed to dominate over all other terms. There are five cases, traditionally notated with the letters (a) through (e). Most diatomic molecules are somewhere between the idealized cases (a) and (b).1
Angular momenta
To describe the Hund's coupling cases, we use the following angular momenta:



 
 , the electronic orbital angular momentum


 
 , the electronic spin angular momentum


 
 , the total electronic angular momentum


 
 
 , the total angular momentum of the system


 
 , the total angular momentum minus the electron spin


 
 , the rotational angular momentum of the nuclei

Choosing the applicable Hund's case
Hund's coupling cases are idealizations. The appropriate case for a given situation can be found by comparing three strengths: the electrostatic coupling of 
 
 
 
  to the internuclear axis, the spin-orbit coupling, and the rotational coupling of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  to the total angular momentum 
 
 
 
 .

The last two rows are degenerate because they have the same good quantum numbers.2
Case (a)
In case (a), 
 
 
 
  is electrostatically coupled to the internuclear axis, and 
 
 
 
  is coupled to 
 
 
 
  by spin-orbit coupling. Then both 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  have well-defined axial components 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively. 
 
 
 
  defines a vector of magnitude 
 
 
 
 
  pointing along the internuclear axis. Combined with the rotational angular momentum of the nuclei 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 . In this case, the precession of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  around the nuclear axis is assumed to be much faster than the nutation of 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  around 
 
 
 
 .
The good quantum numbers in case (a) are 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We express the rotational energy operator as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a rotational constant. There are, ideally, 
 
 
 
 
  fine-structure states, each with rotational levels having relative energies 
 
 
 
  starting with 
 
 
 
 .3
Case (b)
In case (b), the spin-orbit coupling is weak or non-existent (in the case 
 
 
 
 ). In this case, we take 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  and assume 
 
 
 
  precesses quickly around the internuclear axis.
The good quantum numbers in case (b) are 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 
 . We express the rotational energy operator as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a rotational constant. The rotational levels therefore have relative energies 
 
 
 
  starting with 
 
 
 
 .4
Case (c)
In case (c), the spin-orbit coupling is stronger than the coupling to the internuclear axis, and 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  from case (a) cannot be defined. Instead
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  combine to form 
 
 
 
 , which has a projection along the internuclear axis of magnitude 
 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 , as in case (a).
The good quantum numbers in case (c) are 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 .5
Case (d)
In case (d), the rotational coupling between 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is much stronger than the electrostatic coupling of 
 
 
 
  to the internuclear axis. Thus we form 
 
 
 
  by coupling 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  and the form 
 
 
 
  by coupling 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
The good quantum numbers in case (d) are 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Because 
 
 
 
  is a good quantum number, the rotational energy is simply 
 
 
 
 
 .6
Case (e)
In case (e), we first form 
 
 
 
  and then form 
 
 
 
  by coupling 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . This case is rare but has been observed.7
The good quantum numbers in case (e) are 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . Because 
 
 
 
  is once again a good quantum number, the rotational energy is 
 
 
 
 .8
