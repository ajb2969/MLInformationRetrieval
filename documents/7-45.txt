   Bôcher's theorem      Bôcher's theorem   In mathematics , Bôcher's theorem is either of two theorems named after the American mathematician Maxime Bôcher .  Bôcher's theorem in complex analysis  In complex analysis , the theorem states that the finite zeros of the derivative     r  ′    (  z  )        superscript  r  normal-′   z    r^{\prime}(z)   of a nonconstant rational function     r   (  z  )       r  z    r(z)   that are not multiple zeros are also the positions of equilibrium in the field of force due to particles of positive mass at the zeros of    r   (  z  )       r  z    r(z)   and particles of negative mass at the poles of    r   (  z  )       r  z    r(z)   , with masses numerically equal to the respective multiplicities, where each particle repels with a force equal to the mass times the inverse distance.  Furthermore, if C 1 and C 2 are two disjoint circular regions which contain respectively all the zeros and all the poles of    r   (  z  )       r  z    r(z)   , then C 1 and C 2 also contain all the critical points of    r   (  z  )       r  z    r(z)   .  Bôcher's theorem for harmonic functions  In harmonic analysis , Bôcher's theorem states that a positive harmonic function in punctured domain (an open domain minus one point in the interior) is a linear combination of a harmonic function in the unpunctured domain with a scaled fundamental solution for the Laplacian in that domain.
