  |} In six-dimensional geometry, a uniform polypeton12 (or uniform 6-polytope) is a six-dimensional uniform polytope. A uniform polypeton is vertex-transitive, and all facets are uniform 5-polytopes.
The complete set of convex uniform polypeta has not been determined, but most can be made as Wythoff constructions from a small set of symmetry groups. These construction operations are represented by the permutations of rings of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams. Each combination of at least one ring on every connected group of nodes in the diagram produces a uniform 6-polytope.
The simplest uniform polypeta are regular polytopes: the 6-simplex {3,3,3,3,3}, the 6-cube (hexeract) {4,3,3,3,3}, and the 6-orthoplex (hexacross) {3,3,3,3,4}.
History of discovery

Regular polytopes: (convex faces)
 
1852: Ludwig Schläfli proved in his manuscript Theorie der vielfachen Kontinuität that there are exactly 3 regular polytopes in 5 or more dimensions.

Convex semiregular polytopes: (Various definitions before Coxeter's uniform category)
 
1900: Thorold Gosset enumerated the list of nonprismatic semiregular convex polytopes with regular facets (convex regular polytera) in his publication On the Regular and Semi-Regular Figures in Space of n Dimensions.3

Convex uniform polytopes:
 
1940: The search was expanded systematically by H.S.M. Coxeter in his publication Regular and Semi-Regular Polytopes.

Nonregular uniform star polytopes: (similar to the nonconvex uniform polyhedra)
 
Ongoing: Thousands of nonconvex uniform polypeta are known, but mostly unpublished. The list is presumed not to be complete, and there is no estimate of how long the complete list will be, although over 10000 convex and nonconvex uniform polytera are currently known, in particular 923 with 6-simplex symmetry. Participating researchers include Jonathan Bowers, Richard Klitzing and Norman Johnson.4


Uniform 6-polytopes by fundamental Coxeter groups
Uniform 6-polytopes with reflective symmetry can be generated by these four Coxeter groups, represented by permutations of rings of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagrams.
There are four fundamental reflective symmety groups which generate 153 unique uniform 6-polytopes.

Enumerating the convex uniform 6-polytopes

Simplex family: A6 [34] - 
 
35 uniform 6-polytopes as permutations of rings in the group diagram, including one regular:
 
{34} - 6-simplex - 


Hypercube/orthoplex family: B6 [4,34] - 
 
63 uniform 6-polytopes as permutations of rings in the group diagram, including two regular forms:
 
{4,33} — 6-cube (hexeract) - 
{33,4} — 6-orthoplex, (hexacross) - 


Demihypercube D6 family: [33,1,1] - 
 
47 uniform 6-polytopes (16 unique) as permutations of rings in the group diagram, including:
 
{3,32,1}, 121 6-demicube (demihexeract) - ; also as h{4,33}, 
{3,3,31,1}, 211 6-orthoplex - 


E6 family: [33,1,1] - 
 
39 uniform 6-polytopes (16 unique) as permutations of rings in the group diagram, including:
 
{3,3,32,1}, 221 - 
{3,32,2}, 122 - 



These fundamental families generate 153 nonprismatic convex uniform polypeta.
In addition, there are 105 uniform 6-polytope constructions based on prisms of the uniform 5-polytopes: [3,3,3,3,2], [4,3,3,3,2], [5,3,3,3,2], [32,1,1,2].
In addition, there are infinitely many uniform 6-polytope based on:

Duoprism prism families: [3,3,2,p,2], [4,3,2,p,2], [5,3,2,p,2].
Duoprism families: [3,3,3,2,p], [4,3,3,2,p], [5,3,3,2,p].
Triaprism family: [p,2,q,2,r].

The A6 family
There are 32+4−1=35 forms, derived by marking one or more nodes of the Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. All 35 are enumerated below. They are named by Norman Johnson from the Wythoff construction operations upon regular 6-simplex (heptapeton). Bowers-style acronym names are given in parentheses for cross-referencing.
The A6 family has symmetry of order 5040 (7 factorial).
The coordinates of uniform 6-polytopes with 6-simplex symmetry can be generated as permutations of simple integers in 7-space, all in hyperplanes with normal vector (1,1,1,1,1,1,1).
See also list of A6 polytopes for graphs of these polytopes.

The D6 family
The D6 family has symmetry of order 23040 (6 factorial x 25).
This family has 3×16−1=47 Wythoffian uniform polytopes, generated by marking one or more nodes of the D6 Coxeter-Dynkin diagram. Of these, 31 (2×16−1) are repeated from the B6 family and 16 are unique to this family. The 16 unique forms are enumerated below. Bowers-style acronym names are given for cross-referencing.

Non-Wythoffian 6-Polytopes
In 6 dimensions and above, there are infinite amount of non-Wythoffian convex uniform polytopes as the Cartesian product of the Grand antiprism in 4 dimensions and a regular polygon in 2 dimensions. It is not yet proven whether or not there are more.
Regular and uniform honeycombs
 There are four fundamental affine Coxeter groups and 27 prismatic groups that generate regular and uniform tessellations in 5-space:

Regular and uniform hyperbolic honeycombs
There are no compact hyperbolic Coxeter groups of rank 6, groups that can generate honeycombs with all finite facets, and a finite vertex figure. However there are 12 noncompact hyperbolic Coxeter groups of rank 6, each generating uniform honeycombs in 5-space as permutations of rings of the Coxeter diagrams.

Notes on the Wythoff construction for the uniform 6-polytopes
Construction of the reflective 6-dimensional uniform polytopes are done through a Wythoff construction process, and represented through a Coxeter-Dynkin diagram, where each node represents a mirror. Nodes are ringed to imply which mirrors are active. The full set of uniform polytopes generated are based on the unique permutations of ringed nodes. Uniform 6-polytopes are named in relation to the regular polytopes in each family. Some families have two regular constructors and thus may have two ways of naming them.
Here's the primary operators available for constructing and naming the uniform 6-polytopes.
The prismatic forms and bifurcating graphs can use the same truncation indexing notation, but require an explicit numbering system on the nodes for clarity.

Description





Parent

t0{p,q,r,s,t}


Any regular 6-polytope



Rectified

t1{p,q,r,s,t}


The edges are fully truncated into single points. The 6-polytope now has the combined faces of the parent and dual.



Birectified

t2{p,q,r,s,t}


Birectification reduces cells to their duals.



Truncated

t0,1{p,q,r,s,t}


Each original vertex is cut off, with a new face filling the gap. Truncation has a degree of freedom, which has one solution that creates a uniform truncated 6-polytope. The 6-polytope has its original faces doubled in sides, and contains the faces of the dual.




Bitruncated

t1,2{p,q,r,s,t}


Bitrunction transforms cells to their dual truncation.



Tritruncated

t2,3{p,q,r,s,t}


Tritruncation transforms 4-faces to their dual truncation.



Cantellated

t0,2{p,q,r,s,t}


In addition to vertex truncation, each original edge is beveled with new rectangular faces appearing in their place. A uniform cantellation is half way between both the parent and dual forms.




Bicantellated

t1,3{p,q,r,s,t}


In addition to vertex truncation, each original edge is beveled with new rectangular faces appearing in their place. A uniform cantellation is half way between both the parent and dual forms.



Runcinated

t0,3{p,q,r,s,t}


Runcination reduces cells and creates new cells at the vertices and edges.



Biruncinated

t1,4{p,q,r,s,t}


Runcination reduces cells and creates new cells at the vertices and edges.



Stericated

t0,4{p,q,r,s,t}


Sterication reduces 4-faces and creates new 4-faces at the vertices, edges, and faces in the gaps.



Pentellated

t0,5{p,q,r,s,t}


Pentellation reduces 5-faces and creates new 5-faces at the vertices, edges, faces, and cells in the gaps. (expansion operation for polypeta)



Omnitruncated

t0,1,2,3,4,5{p,q,r,s,t}


All five operators, truncation, cantellation, runcination, sterication, and pentellation are applied.

A proposed name polypeton (plural: polypeta) has been advocated, from the Greek root poly- meaning "many", a shortened penta- meaning "five", and suffix -on. "Five" refers to the dimension of the 5-polytope facets.↩
