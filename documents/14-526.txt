   Divisibility sequence      Divisibility sequence   In mathematics, a divisibility sequence is an integer sequence      (   a  n   )    n  ∈  𝒩      subscript   subscript  a  n     n  𝒩     {(a_{n})}_{n\in\mathcal{N}}   such that for all natural numbers m , n ,       if  m   ∣   n  then   a  m    ∣    a  n    ,      if  m   delimited-∣∣    n  then   subscript  a  m      subscript  a  n     \text{if }m\mid n\text{ then }a_{m}\mid a_{n},     i.e., whenever one index is a multiple of another one, then the corresponding term also is a multiple of the other term. The concept can be generalized to sequences with values in any ring where the concept of divisibility is defined.  A strong divisibility sequence is an integer sequence     (   a  n   )    n  ∈  𝒩      subscript   subscript  a  n     n  𝒩     {(a_{n})}_{n\in\mathcal{N}}   such that for all natural numbers m , n ,        gcd   (   a  m   ,   a  n   )    =   a   gcd   (  m  ,  n  )      .         subscript  a  m    subscript  a  n     subscript  a    m  n      \gcd(a_{m},a_{n})=a_{\gcd(m,n)}.     Note that a strong divisibility sequence is immediately a divisibility sequence; if    m  ∣  n     fragments  m  normal-∣  n    m\mid n   , immediately     g  c  d   (  m  ,  n  )    =  m        g  c  d   m  n    m    gcd(m,n)=m   . Then by the strong divisibility property,     g  c  d   (   a  m   ,   a  n   )    =   a  m         g  c  d    subscript  a  m    subscript  a  n      subscript  a  m     gcd(a_{m},a_{n})=a_{m}   and therefore     a  m   ∣   a  n      fragments   subscript  a  m   normal-∣   subscript  a  n     a_{m}\mid a_{n}   .  Examples   Any constant sequence is a strong divisibility sequence.  Every sequence of the form     a  n   =   k  n        subscript  a  n     k  n     a_{n}=kn   , for some nonzero integer k , is a divisibility sequence.  Every sequence of the form     a  n   =    A  n   -   B  n         subscript  a  n      superscript  A  n    superscript  B  n      a_{n}=A^{n}-B^{n}   for integers    A  >  B  >  0        A  B       0     A>B>0   is a divisibility sequence.  The Fibonacci numbers  F = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,...) form a strong divisibility sequence.  More generally, Lucas sequences of the first kind are divisibility sequences.  Elliptic divisibility sequences are another class of such sequences.   References          "  Category:Sequences and series  Category:Integer sequences  Category:Arithmetic functions
