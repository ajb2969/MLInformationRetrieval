Divisibility sequence

In mathematics, a divisibility sequence is an integer sequence

 
  such that for all natural numbers m, n,



i.e., whenever one index is a multiple of another one, then the corresponding term also is a multiple of the other term. The concept can be generalized to sequences with values in any ring where the concept of divisibility is defined.
A strong divisibility sequence is an integer sequence 
 
 
 
  such that for all natural numbers m, n,



Note that a strong divisibility sequence is immediately a divisibility sequence; if 
 
 
 
 , immediately 
 
 
 
 . Then by the strong divisibility property, 
 
 
 
  and therefore 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

Any constant sequence is a strong divisibility sequence.
Every sequence of the form 
 
 
 
 , for some nonzero integer k, is a divisibility sequence.
Every sequence of the form 
 
 
 
  for integers 
 
 
 
  is a divisibility sequence.
The Fibonacci numbers F = (1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8,...) form a strong divisibility sequence.
More generally, Lucas sequences of the first kind are divisibility sequences.
Elliptic divisibility sequences are another class of such sequences.
