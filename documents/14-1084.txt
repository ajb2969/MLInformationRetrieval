   Internal category      Internal category   In mathematics , more specifically in category theory - internal categories are a generalisation of the notion of small category , and are defined with respect to a fixed ambient category. If the ambient category is taken to be the category of sets then one recovers the theory of small categories. In general, internal categories consist of a pair of objects in the ambient category - thought of as the 'object of objects' and 'object of morphisms', together with a collection of morphisms in the ambient category satisfying certain identities. Group objects , are common examples of internal categories.  There are notions of internal functors and natural transformations which make the collection of internal categories in a fixed category into a 2-category .  Definitions  Let   C   C   C   be a category with pullbacks . An internal category in   C   C   C   consists of the following data: two   C   C   C   -objects     C  0   ,   C  1       subscript  C  0    subscript  C  1     C_{0},C_{1}   named "object of objects" and "object of morphisms" respectively and four   C   C   C   -arrows      d  0   ,   d  1    :    C  1   →    C  0   ,  e    :    C  0   →    C  1   ,  m    :     C  1    ×   C  0     C  1    →   C  1         normal-:    subscript  d  0    subscript  d  1     normal-→   subscript  C  1     subscript  C  0   e      normal-:     normal-→   subscript  C  0     subscript  C  1   m      normal-:     normal-→    subscript    subscript  C  0     subscript  C  1    subscript  C  1     subscript  C  1       d_{0},d_{1}:C_{1}\rightarrow C_{0},e:C_{0}\rightarrow C_{1},m:C_{1}\times_{C_{%
