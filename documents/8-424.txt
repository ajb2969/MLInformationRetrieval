   Witt group      Witt group   In mathematics, a Witt group of a field, named after Ernst Witt , is an abelian group whose elements are represented by symmetric bilinear forms over the field.  Definition  Fix a field k of characteristic not two. All vector spaces will be assumed to be finite-dimensional. We say that two spaces equipped with symmetric bilinear forms are equivalent if one can be obtained from the other by adding a metabolic quadratic space , that is, zero or more copies of a hyperbolic plane , the non-degenerate two-dimensional symmetric bilinear form with a norm 0 vector. 1 Each class is represented by the core form of a Witt decomposition . 2  The Witt group of k is the abelian group W ( k ) of equivalence classes of non-degenerate symmetric bilinear forms, with the group operation corresponding to the orthogonal direct sum of forms. It is additively generated by the classes of one-dimensional forms. 3 Although classes may contain spaces of different dimension, the parity of the dimension is constant across a class and so rk : W ( k ) → Z /2 Z is a homomorphism. 4  The elements of finite order in the Witt group have order a power of 2; 5 6 the torsion subgroup is the kernel of the functorial map from W ( k ) to W ( k py ), where k py is the Pythagorean closure of k ; 7 it is generated by the Pfister forms . 8 If k is not formally real, then the Witt group is torsion , with exponent a power of 2. 9 The height of the field k is the exponent of the torsion in the Witt group, if this is finite, or ∞ otherwise. 10  Ring structure  The Witt group of k can be given a commutative ring structure, by using the tensor product of two bilinear forms to define the ring product. This is sometimes called the Witt ring  W ( k ), though the term "Witt ring" is often also used for a completely different ring of Witt vectors .  To discuss the structure of this ring we assume that k is of characteristic not equal to 2, so that we may identify symmetric bilinear forms and quadratic forms.  The kernel of the rank mod 2 homomorphism is a prime ideal , I , of the Witt ring 11 termed the fundamental ideal . 12 The ring homomorphisms from W ( k ) to Z correspond to the field orderings of k , by taking signature with respective to the ordering. 13 The Witt ring is a Jacobson ring . 14 It is a Noetherian ring if and only if there are finitely many square classes ; that is, if the squares in k form a subgroup of finite index in the multiplicative group. 15  If k is not formally real, the fundamental ideal is the only prime ideal of W 16 and consists precisely of the nilpotent elements ; 17  W is a local ring and has Krull dimension 0. 18  If k is real, then the nilpotent elements are precisely those of finite additive order, and these in turn are the forms all of whose signatures are zero; 19  W has Krull dimension 1. 20  If k is a real Pythagorean field then the zero-divisors of W are the elements for which some signature is zero; otherwise, the zero-divisors are exactly the fundamental ideal. 21 22  If k is an ordered field with positive cone P then Sylvester's law of inertia holds for quadratic forms over k and the signature defines a ring homomorphism from W ( k ) to Z , with kernel a prime ideal  K P . These prime ideals are in bijection with the orderings X k of k and constitute the minimal prime ideal spectrum MinSpec W ( k ) of W ( k ). The bijection is a homeomorphism between MinSpec W ( k ) with the Zariski topology and the set of orderings X k with the Harrison topology . 23  The n -th power of the fundamental ideal is additively generated by the n -fold Pfister forms . 24  Examples   The Witt ring of C , and indeed any algebraically closed field or quadratically closed field , is Z /2 Z . 25  The Witt ring of R is Z . 26  The Witt ring of a finite field F q with q odd is Z /4 Z if q is 3 mod 4 and isomorphic to the group ring ( Z /2 Z )[ F* / F* 2 ] if q = 1 mod 4. 27  The Witt ring of a local field with maximal ideal of norm congruent to 1 modulo 4 is isomorphic to the group ring ( Z /2 Z )[ V ] where V is the Klein 4-group . 28  The Witt ring of a local field with maximal ideal of norm congruent to 3 modulo 4 is ( Z /4 Z )[ C 2 ] where C 2 is a cyclic group of order 2. 29  The Witt ring of Q 2 is of order 32 and is given by 30            𝐙  8    [  s  ,  t  ]    /   ⟨   2  s   ,   2  t   ,   s  2   ,   t  2   ,    s  t   -  4   ⟩    .         subscript  𝐙  8    s  t       2  s     2  t    superscript  s  2    superscript  t  2       s  t   4      \mathbf{Z}_{8}[s,t]/\langle 2s,2t,s^{2},t^{2},st-4\rangle\ .        Invariants  Certain invariants of a quadratic form can be regarded as functions on Witt classes. We have seen that dimension mod 2 is a function on classes: the discriminant is also well-defined. The Hasse invariant of a quadratic form is again a well-defined function on Witt classes with values in the Brauer group of the field of definition. 31  Rank and discriminant  We define a ring over K , Q ( K ), as a set of pairs ( d , e ) with d in K* / K* 2 and e in Z /2 Z . Addition and multiplication are defined by:        (   d  1   ,   e  1   )   +   (   d  2   ,   e  2   )    =   (     (   -  1   )     e  1    e  2      d  1    d  2    ,    e  1   +   e  2    )           subscript  d  1    subscript  e  1      subscript  d  2    subscript  e  2         superscript    1      subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2      subscript  d  1    subscript  d  2       subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2       (d_{1},e_{1})+(d_{2},e_{2})=((-1)^{e_{1}e_{2}}d_{1}d_{2},e_{1}+e_{2})            (   d  1   ,   e  1   )   ⋅   (   d  2   ,   e  2   )    =   (    d  1   e  2     d  2   e  1     ,    e  1    e  2    )    .       normal-⋅    subscript  d  1    subscript  e  1      subscript  d  2    subscript  e  2         superscript   subscript  d  1    subscript  e  2     superscript   subscript  d  2    subscript  e  1        subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2       (d_{1},e_{1})\cdot(d_{2},e_{2})=(d_{1}^{e_{2}}d_{2}^{e_{1}},e_{1}e_{2})\ .     Then there is a surjective ring homomorphism from W( K ) to this obtained by mapping a class to discriminant and rank mod 2. The kernel is I 2 . 32 The elements of Q may be regarded as classifying graded quadratic extensions of K . 33  Brauer–Wall group  The triple of discriminant, rank mod 2 and Hasse invariant defines a map from W( K ) to the Brauer–Wall group BW( K ). 34  Witt ring of a local field  Let K be a complete local field with valuation v , uniformiser π and residue field k of characteristic not 2. There is an injection W ( k ) → W ( K ) which lifts the diagonal form ⟨ a 1 ,... a n ⟩ to ⟨ u 1 ,... u n ⟩ where u i is a unit of K with image a i in k . This yields       W   (  K  )    =    W   (  k  )    ⊕     ⟨  π  ⟩   ⋅  W    (  k  )           W  K    direct-sum    W  k      normal-⋅   delimited-⟨⟩  π   W   k      W(K)=W(k)\oplus\langle\pi\rangle\cdot W(k)     identifying W ( k ) with its image in W ( K ). 35  Witt ring of a number field  Let K be a number field . For quadratic forms over K , there is a Hasse invariant ±1 for every finite place corresponding to the Hilbert symbols . The invariants of a form over a number field are precisely the dimension, discriminant, all local Hasse invariants and the signatures coming from real embeddings. 36  We define the symbol ring over K , Sym( K ), as a set of triples ( d , e , f ) with d in K* / K* 2 , e in Z /2 and f a sequence of elements ±1 indexed by the places of K , subject to the condition that all but finitely many terms of f are +1, that the value on acomplex places is +1 and that the product of all the terms in f in +1. Let [ a , b ] be the sequence of Hilbert symbols: it satisfies the conditions on f just stated. 37  We define addition and multiplication as follows:        (   d  1   ,   e  1   ,   f  1   )   +   (   d  2   ,   e  2   ,   f  2   )    =   (     (   -  1   )     e  1    e  2      d  1    d  2    ,    e  1   +   e  2    ,    [   d  1   ,   d  2   ]    [   -    d  1    d  2     ,    (   -  1   )     e  1    e  2     ]    f  1    f  2    )           subscript  d  1    subscript  e  1    subscript  f  1      subscript  d  2    subscript  e  2    subscript  f  2         superscript    1      subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2      subscript  d  1    subscript  d  2       subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2        subscript  d  1    subscript  d  2          subscript  d  1    subscript  d  2      superscript    1      subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2       subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2       (d_{1},e_{1},f_{1})+(d_{2},e_{2},f_{2})=((-1)^{e_{1}e_{2}}d_{1}d_{2},e_{1}+e_{%
 2},[d_{1},d_{2}][-d_{1}d_{2},(-1)^{e_{1}e_{2}}]f_{1}f_{2})            (   d  1   ,   e  1   ,   f  1   )   ⋅   (   d  2   ,   e  2   ,   f  2   )    =   (    d  1   e  2     d  2   e  1     ,    e  1    e  2    ,     [   d  1   ,   d  2   ]    1  +    e  1    e  2       f  1   e  2     f  2   e  1     )    .       normal-⋅    subscript  d  1    subscript  e  1    subscript  f  1      subscript  d  2    subscript  e  2    subscript  f  2         superscript   subscript  d  1    subscript  e  2     superscript   subscript  d  2    subscript  e  1        subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2       superscript    subscript  d  1    subscript  d  2      1     subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2       superscript   subscript  f  1    subscript  e  2     superscript   subscript  f  2    subscript  e  1        (d_{1},e_{1},f_{1})\cdot(d_{2},e_{2},f_{2})=(d_{1}^{e_{2}}d_{2}^{e_{1}},e_{1}e%
 _{2},[d_{1},d_{2}]^{1+e_{1}e_{2}}f_{1}^{e_{2}}f_{2}^{e_{1}})\ .     Then there is a surjective ring homomorphism from W( K ) to Sym( K ) obtained by mapping a class to discriminant, rank mod 2, and the sequence of Hasse invariants. The kernel is I 3 . 38  The symbol ring is a realisation of the Brauer-Wall group. 39  Witt ring of the rationals  The Hasse–Minkowski theorem implies that there is an injection 40        W   (  𝐐  )    →    W   (  𝐑  )    ⊕    ∏  p    W   (   𝐐  p   )       .     normal-→    W  𝐐    direct-sum    W  𝐑     subscript  product  p     W   subscript  𝐐  p        W(\mathbf{Q})\rightarrow W(\mathbf{R})\oplus\prod_{p}W(\mathbf{Q}_{p})\ .     We make this concrete, and compute the image, by using the "second residue homomorphism" W( Q p ) → W( F p ). Composed with the map W( Q ) → W( Q p ) we obtain a group homomorphism ∂ p : W( Q ) → W( F p ) (for p =2 we define ∂ 2 to be the 2-adic valuation of the discriminant, taken mod 2).  We then have a split exact sequence 41      𝐙  →   W   (  𝐐  )    →    𝐙  /  2   ⊕    ∏   p  ≠  2     W   (   𝐅  p   )      →  0       normal-→  𝐙    W  𝐐     normal-→     direct-sum    𝐙  2     subscript  product    p  2      W   subscript  𝐅  p        normal-→    0     \mathbf{Z}\rightarrow W(\mathbf{Q})\rightarrow\mathbf{Z}/2\oplus\prod_{p\neq 2%
 }W(\mathbf{F}_{p})\rightarrow 0     which can be written as an isomorphism       W   (  𝐐  )    ≅   𝐙  ⊕   𝐙  /  2   ⊕    ∏   p  ≠  2     W   (   𝐅  p   )            W  𝐐    direct-sum  𝐙    𝐙  2     subscript  product    p  2      W   subscript  𝐅  p        W(\mathbf{Q})\cong\mathbf{Z}\oplus\mathbf{Z}/2\oplus\prod_{p\neq 2}W(\mathbf{F%
 }_{p})     where the first component is the signature. 42  Witt ring and Milnor's K-theory  Let k be a field of characteristic not equal to 2 . The powers of the ideal I of forms of even dimension ("fundamental ideal") in W(k) form a descending filtration and one may consider the associated graded ring, that is the direct sum of quotients I n /I (n+1) . Let ⟨a⟩ be the quadratic form ax 2 considered as an element of the Witt ring. Then ⟨a⟩-⟨1⟩ is an element of I and correspondingly a product of the form  ''1  ,...,a n >>=(⟨a 1 ⟩-⟨1⟩)...(⟨a n ⟩-⟨1⟩)''  is an element of I n . John Milnor in a 1970 paper 43 proved that the mapping from (k*) n to I n /I (n+1) that sends (a 1 ,...,a n ) to 1,...,a n >> is multi-linear and maps Steinberg elements (elements such that for some i , j such that i≠j one has a i +a j =1 ) to zero. This means that this mapping defines a homomorphism from the Milnor ring of k to the graded Witt ring. Milnor showed also that this homomorphism sends elements divisible by 2 to zero and that it is surjective. In the same paper he made a conjecture that this homomorphism is an isomorphism for all fields k (of characteristic different from 2 ). This became known as the Milnor's conjecture on quadratic forms.  It was proved in 1996 (published in 2007) by Dmitry Orlov, Alexander Vishik and Vladimir Voevodsky leading to a rise of new understanding of the structure of quadratic forms over general fields.  Grothendieck-Witt ring  The Grothendieck-Witt ring  GW is a related construction generated by isometry classes of nonsingular quadratic spaces with addition given by orthogonal sum and multiplication given by tensor product. Since two spaces that differ by a hyperbolic plane are not identified in GW , the inverse for the addition needs to be introduced formally through the construction that was discovered by Grothendieck (see Grothendieck group ). There is a natural homomorphism GW → Z given by dimension: a field is quadratically closed if and only if this is an isomorphism. 44 The hyperbolic spaces generate an ideal in GW and the Witt ring W is the quotient. 45 The exterior power gives the Grothendieck-Witt ring the additional structure of a λ-ring . 46  Examples   The Grothendieck-Witt ring of C , and indeed any algebraically closed field or quadratically closed field , is Z . 47  The Grothendieck-Witt ring of R is isomorphic to the group ring Z [ C 2 ], where C 2 is a cyclic group of order 2. 48  The Grothendieck-Witt ring of any finite field of odd characteristic is Z ⊕ Z /2 Z with trivial multiplication in the second component. 49  The Grothendieck-Witt ring of a local field with maximal ideal of norm congruent to 1 modulo 4 is isomorphic to Z ⊕ ( Z /2 Z ) 3 . 50  The Grothendieck-Witt ring of a local field with maximal ideal of norm congruent to 3 modulo 4 it is Z ⊕ Z /4 Z ⊕ Z /2 Z . 51   Grothendieck-Witt ring and motivic stable homotopy groups of spheres  It was shown recently by Fabien Morel  52 53 that the Grothendieck-Witt ring of a perfect field is isomorphic to the motivic stable homotopy group of spheres π 0,0 (S 0,0 ) (see " A¹ homotopy theory ").  Witt equivalence  Two fields are said to be Witt equivalent if their Witt rings are isomorphic.  For global fields there is a local-to-global principle: two global fields are Witt equivalent if and only if there is a bijection between their places such that the corresponding local fields are Witt equivalent. 54 In particular, two number fields K and L are Witt equivalent if and only if there is a bijection T between the places of K and the places of L and a group isomorphism t between their square-class groups , preserving degree 2 Hilbert symbols. In this case the pair ( T , t ) is called a reciprocity equivalence or a degree 2 Hilbert symbol equivalence . 55 Some variations and extensions of this condition, such as "tame degree l Hilbert symbol equivalence", have also been studied. 56  Generalizations  Witt groups can also be defined in the same way for skew-symmetric forms , and for quadratic forms , and more generally ε-quadratic forms , over any *-ring  R .  The resulting groups (and generalizations thereof) are known as the even-dimensional symmetric L -groups  L 2 k ( R ) and even-dimensional quadratic L -groups L 2 k ( R ). The quadratic L -groups are 4-periodic, with L 0 ( R ) being the Witt group of (1)-quadratic forms (symmetric), and L 2 ( R ) being the Witt group of (-1)-quadratic forms (skew-symmetric); symmetric L -groups are not 4-periodic for all rings, hence they provide a less exact generalization.  L -groups are central objects in surgery theory , forming one of the three terms of the surgery exact sequence .
