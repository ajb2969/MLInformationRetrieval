   Uridine phosphorylase      Uridine phosphorylase   In enzymology , an uridine phosphorylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   uridine + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   uracil + alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are uridine and phosphate , whereas its two products are uracil and alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is uridine:phosphate alpha-D-ribosyltransferase . Other names in common use include pyrimidine phosphorylase , UrdPase , UPH , and UPase . This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 27 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
