Locally compact quantum group

A locally compact quantum group is a relatively new C*-algebraic approach toward quantum groups that generalizes the Kac-algebra, compact-quantum-group and Hopf-algebra approaches. Earlier attempts at a unifying definition of quantum groups using, for example, multiplicative unitaries have enjoyed some success but have also encountered several technical problems.
One of the main features distinguishing this new approach from its predecessors is the axiomatic existence of left and right invariant weights. This gives a noncommutative analogue of left and right Haar measures on a locally compact Hausdorff group.
Definitions
Before we can even begin to properly define a locally compact quantum group, we first need to define a number of preliminary concepts and also state a few theorems.
Definition (weight). Let 
 
 
 
  be a C*-algebra, and let 
 
 
 
  denote the set of positive elements of 
 
 
 
 . A weight on 
 
 
 
  is a function 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

Some notation for weights. Let 
 
 
 
  be a weight on a C*-algebra 
 
 
 
 . We use the following notation:



 
 , which is called the set of all positive 
 
 
 
 -integrable elements of 
 
 
 
 .


 
 , which is called the set of all 

 
 -square-integrable elements of 
 
 
 
 .


 
 , which is called the set of all 

 
 -integrable elements of 
 
 
 
 .

Types of weights. Let 
 
 
 
  be a weight on a C*-algebra 
 
 
 
 .

We say that 
 
 
 
  is faithful if and only if 
 
 
 
  for each non-zero 
 
 
 
 .
We say that 
 
 
 
  is lower semi-continuous if and only if the set 
 
 
 
  is a closed subset of 
 
 
 
  for every 
 
 
 
 .
We say that 
 
 
 
  is densely defined if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a dense subset of 
 
 
 
 , or equivalently, if and only if either 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  is a dense subset of 
 
 
 
 .
We say that 
 
 
 
  is proper if and only if it is non-zero, lower semi-continuous and densely defined.

Definition (one-parameter group). Let 
 
 
 
  be a C*-algebra. A one-parameter group on 
 
 
 
  is a family 
 
 
 
  of *-automorphisms of 
 
 
 
  that satisfies 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 . We say that 
 
 
 
  is norm-continuous if and only if for every 
 
 
 
 , the mapping 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  is continuous.
Definition (analytic extension of a one-parameter group). Given a norm-continuous one-parameter group 
 
 
 
  on a C*-algebra 
 
 
 
 , we are going to define an analytic extension of 
 
 
 
 . For each 
 
 
 
 , let


 
 , which is a horizontal strip in the complex plane. We call a function 
 
 
norm-regular if and only if the following conditions hold:

It is analytic on the interior of 
 
 
 
 , i.e., for each 
 
 
 
  in the interior of 
 
 
 
 , the limit 
 
 
 
  exists with respect to the norm topology on 
 
 
 
 .
It is norm-bounded on 
 
 
 
 .
It is norm-continuous on 
 
 
 
 .

Suppose now that 
 
 
 
 , and let


 
  Define 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . The function 
 
 
 
  is uniquely determined (by the theory of complex-analytic functions), so 
 
 
 
  is well-defined indeed. The family 
 
 
 
  is then called the analytic extension of 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem 1. The set 
 
 
 
 , called the set of analytic elements of 
 
 
 
 , is a dense subset of 
 
 
 
 .
Definition (K.M.S. weight). Let 
 
 
 
  be a C*-algebra and 
 
 
 
  a weight on 
 
 
 
 . We say that 
 
 
 
  is a K.M.S. weight ('K.M.S.' stands for 'Kubo-Martin-Schwinger') on 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is a proper weight on 
 
 
 
  and there exists a norm-continuous one-parameter group 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  is invariant under 
 
 
 
 , i.e., 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , and
for every 
 
 
 
 , we have 
 
 
 
 .

Theorem 2. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are C*-algebras and 
 
 
 
  is a non-degenerate *-homomorphism (i.e., 
 
 
 
  is a dense subset of 
 
 
 
 ), then we can uniquely extend 
 
 
 
  to a *-homomorphism 
 
 
 
 .
Theorem 3. If 
 
 
 
  is a state (i.e., a positive linear functional of norm 
 
 
 
 ) on 
 
 
 
 , then we can uniquely extend 
 
 
 
  to a state 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 .
Definition (Locally compact quantum group). A (C*-algebraic) locally compact quantum group is an ordered pair 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a C*-algebra and 
 
 
 
  is a non-degenerate *-homomorphism called the co-multiplication, that satisfies the following four conditions:

The co-multiplication is co-associative, i.e., 
 
 
 
 .
The sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are linearly dense subsets of 
 
 
 
 .
There exists a faithful K.M.S. weight 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  that is left-invariant, i.e., 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
There exists a K.M.S. weight 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  that is right-invariant, i.e., 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .

From the definition of a locally compact quantum group, it can be shown that the right-invariant K.M.S. weight 
 
 
 
  is automatically faithful. Therefore, the faithfulness of 
 
 
 
  is a redundant condition and does not need to be postulated.
Duality
The category of locally compact quantum groups allows for a dual construction with which one can prove that the bi-dual of a locally compact quantum group is isomorphic to the original one. This result gives a far-reaching generalization of Pontryagin duality for locally compact Hausdorff abelian groups.
Alternative Formulations
The theory has an equivalent formulation in terms of von Neumann algebras.
