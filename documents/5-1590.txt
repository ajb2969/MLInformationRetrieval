   Locally compact quantum group      Locally compact quantum group   A locally compact quantum group is a relatively new C*-algebraic approach toward quantum groups that generalizes the Kac-algebra, compact-quantum-group and Hopf-algebra approaches. Earlier attempts at a unifying definition of quantum groups using, for example, multiplicative unitaries have enjoyed some success but have also encountered several technical problems.  One of the main features distinguishing this new approach from its predecessors is the axiomatic existence of left and right invariant weights. This gives a noncommutative analogue of left and right Haar measures on a locally compact Hausdorff group.  Definitions  Before we can even begin to properly define a locally compact quantum group, we first need to define a number of preliminary concepts and also state a few theorems.  Definition (weight). Let   A   A   A   be a C*-algebra , and let    A    ≥  0      subscript  A    absent  0     A_{\geq 0}   denote the set of positive elements of   A   A   A   . A weight on   A   A   A   is a function    ϕ  :    A    ≥  0    →   [  0  ,  ∞  ]       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→   subscript  A    absent  0     0       \phi:A_{\geq 0}\to[0,\infty]   such that        ϕ   (    a  1   +   a  2    )    =    ϕ   (   a  1   )    +   ϕ   (   a  2   )           ϕ     subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2         ϕ   subscript  a  1      ϕ   subscript  a  2       \phi(a_{1}+a_{2})=\phi(a_{1})+\phi(a_{2})   for all      a  1   ,   a  2    ∈   A    ≥  0          subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2     subscript  A    absent  0      a_{1},a_{2}\in A_{\geq 0}   , and       ϕ   (   r  ⋅  a   )    =    r  ⋅  ϕ    (  a  )          ϕ   normal-⋅  r  a       normal-⋅  r  ϕ   a     \phi(r\cdot a)=r\cdot\phi(a)   for all    r  ∈   [  0  ,  ∞  )       r   0      r\in[0,\infty)   and    a  ∈   A    ≥  0        a   subscript  A    absent  0      a\in A_{\geq 0}   .   Some notation for weights. Let   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   be a weight on a C*-algebra   A   A   A   . We use the following notation:        ℳ  ϕ  +   :=   {   a  ∈   A    ≥  0     ∣    ϕ   (  a  )    <  ∞   }      assign   superscript   subscript  ℳ  ϕ      conditional-set    a   subscript  A    absent  0         ϕ  a        \mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+}:=\{a\in A_{\geq 0}\mid\phi(a)<\infty\}   , which is called the set of all positive   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   -integrable elements of   A   A   A   .       𝒩  ϕ   :=   {   a  ∈  A   ∣    ϕ   (    a  *   a   )    <  ∞   }      assign   subscript  𝒩  ϕ    conditional-set    a  A       ϕ     superscript  a    a         \mathcal{N}_{\phi}:=\{a\in A\mid\phi(a^{*}a)<\infty\}   , which is called the set of all    ϕ   ϕ   \phi   -square-integrable elements of   A   A   A   .       ℳ  ϕ   :=    Span    ℳ  ϕ  +    =    𝒩  ϕ  *    𝒩  ϕ         assign   subscript  ℳ  ϕ     Span   superscript   subscript  ℳ  ϕ              superscript   subscript  𝒩  ϕ      subscript  𝒩  ϕ       \mathcal{M}_{\phi}:=\text{Span}~{}\mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+}=\mathcal{N}_{\phi}^{*%
 }\mathcal{N}_{\phi}   , which is called the set of all    ϕ   ϕ   \phi   -integrable elements of   A   A   A   .   Types of weights. Let   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   be a weight on a C*-algebra   A   A   A   .   We say that   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is faithful if and only if     ϕ   (  a  )    ≠  0        ϕ  a   0    \phi(a)\neq 0   for each non-zero    a  ∈   A    ≥  0        a   subscript  A    absent  0      a\in A_{\geq 0}   .  We say that   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is lower semi-continuous if and only if the set    {   a  ∈   A    ≥  0     ∣    ϕ   (  a  )    ≤  λ   }     conditional-set    a   subscript  A    absent  0         ϕ  a   λ     \{a\in A_{\geq 0}\mid\phi(a)\leq\lambda\}   is a closed subset of   A   A   A   for every    λ  ∈   [  0  ,  ∞  ]       λ   0      \lambda\in[0,\infty]   .  We say that   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is densely defined if and only if    ℳ  ϕ  +     superscript   subscript  ℳ  ϕ      \mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+}   is a dense subset of    A    ≥  0      subscript  A    absent  0     A_{\geq 0}   , or equivalently, if and only if either    𝒩  ϕ     subscript  𝒩  ϕ    \mathcal{N}_{\phi}   or    ℳ  ϕ     subscript  ℳ  ϕ    \mathcal{M}_{\phi}   is a dense subset of   A   A   A   .  We say that   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is proper if and only if it is non-zero, lower semi-continuous and densely defined.   Definition (one-parameter group). Let   A   A   A   be a C*-algebra. A one-parameter group on   A   A   A   is a family    α  =    (   α  t   )    t  ∈  ℝ        α   subscript   subscript  α  t     t  ℝ      \alpha=(\alpha_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}   of *-automorphisms of   A   A   A   that satisfies      α  s   ∘   α  t    =   α   s  +  t           subscript  α  s    subscript  α  t     subscript  α    s  t      \alpha_{s}\circ\alpha_{t}=\alpha_{s+t}   for all     s  ,  t   ∈  ℝ       s  t   ℝ    s,t\in\mathbb{R}   . We say that   α   α   \alpha   is norm-continuous if and only if for every    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   , the mapping    ℝ  →  A     normal-→  ℝ  A    \mathbb{R}\to A   defined by    t  ↦    α  t    (  a  )       maps-to  t     subscript  α  t   a     t\mapsto{\alpha_{t}}(a)   is continuous.  Definition (analytic extension of a one-parameter group). Given a norm-continuous one-parameter group   α   α   \alpha   on a C*-algebra   A   A   A   , we are going to define an analytic extension of   α   α   \alpha   . For each    z  ∈  ℂ      z  ℂ    z\in\mathbb{C}   , let       I   (  z  )    :=   {   y  ∈  ℂ   ∣    |   ℑ   (  y  )    |   ≤   |   ℑ   (  z  )    |    }      assign    I  z    conditional-set    y  ℂ         y        z        I(z):=\{y\in\mathbb{C}\mid|\Im(y)|\leq|\Im(z)|\}   , which is a horizontal strip in the complex plane. We call a function    f  :    I   (  z  )    →  A      normal-:  f   normal-→    I  z   A     f:I(z)\to A    norm-regular if and only if the following conditions hold:   It is analytic on the interior of    I   (  z  )       I  z    I(z)   , i.e., for each    y  0     subscript  y  0    y_{0}   in the interior of    I   (  z  )       I  z    I(z)   , the limit     lim   y  →   y  0         f   (  y  )    -   f   (   y  0   )      y  -   y  0          subscript    normal-→  y   subscript  y  0           f  y     f   subscript  y  0       y   subscript  y  0       \displaystyle\lim_{y\to y_{0}}\frac{f(y)-f(y_{0})}{y-y_{0}}   exists with respect to the norm topology on   A   A   A   .  It is norm-bounded on    I   (  z  )       I  z    I(z)   .  It is norm-continuous on    I   (  z  )       I  z    I(z)   .   Suppose now that    z  ∈   ℂ  ∖  ℝ       z    ℂ  ℝ     z\in\mathbb{C}\setminus\mathbb{R}   , and let        D  z   :=   {   a  ∈  A   ∣     There exists a norm-regular   f   :    I   (  z  )    →    A    such that   f   (  t  )    =    α  t    (  a  )    for all   t   ∈  ℝ    }    .     assign   subscript  D  z    conditional-set    a  A    normal-:    There exists a norm-regular  f      normal-→    I  z     A  such that  f  t           subscript  α  t   a  for all  t        ℝ        D_{z}:=\{a\in A\mid\text{There exists a norm-regular}~{}f:I(z)\to A~{}\text{%
 such that}~{}f(t)={\alpha_{t}}(a)~{}\text{for all}~{}t\in\mathbb{R}\}.   Define     α  z   :    D  z   →  A      normal-:   subscript  α  z    normal-→   subscript  D  z   A     \alpha_{z}:D_{z}\to A   by      α  z    (  a  )    :=   f   (  z  )       assign     subscript  α  z   a     f  z     {\alpha_{z}}(a):=f(z)   . The function   f   f   f   is uniquely determined (by the theory of complex-analytic functions), so    α  z     subscript  α  z    \alpha_{z}   is well-defined indeed. The family     (   α  z   )    z  ∈  ℂ      subscript   subscript  α  z     z  ℂ     (\alpha_{z})_{z\in\mathbb{C}}   is then called the analytic extension of   α   α   \alpha   .  Theorem 1. The set     ∩   z  ∈  ℂ     D  z       subscript     z  ℂ     subscript  D  z     \cap_{z\in\mathbb{C}}D_{z}   , called the set of analytic elements of   A   A   A   , is a dense subset of   A   A   A   .  Definition (K.M.S. weight). Let   A   A   A   be a C*-algebra and    ϕ  :    A    ≥  0    →   [  0  ,  ∞  ]       normal-:  ϕ   normal-→   subscript  A    absent  0     0       \phi:A_{\geq 0}\to[0,\infty]   a weight on   A   A   A   . We say that   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a K.M.S. weight ('K.M.S.' stands for 'Kubo-Martin-Schwinger') on   A   A   A   if and only if   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a proper weight on   A   A   A   and there exists a norm-continuous one-parameter group     (   σ  t   )    t  ∈  ℝ      subscript   subscript  σ  t     t  ℝ     (\sigma_{t})_{t\in\mathbb{R}}   on   A   A   A   such that      ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is invariant under   σ   σ   \sigma   , i.e.,     ϕ  ∘   σ  t    =  ϕ        ϕ   subscript  σ  t    ϕ    \phi\circ\sigma_{t}=\phi   for all    t  ∈  ℝ      t  ℝ    t\in\mathbb{R}   , and  for every    a  ∈   Dom   (   σ   i  /  2    )        a    Dom   subscript  σ    i  2       a\in\text{Dom}(\sigma_{i/2})   , we have     ϕ   (    a  *   a   )    =   ϕ   (    σ   i  /  2     (  a  )     [    σ   i  /  2     (  a  )    ]   *    )          ϕ     superscript  a    a      ϕ     subscript  σ    i  2    a   superscript   delimited-[]     subscript  σ    i  2    a          \phi(a^{*}a)=\phi(\sigma_{i/2}(a)[\sigma_{i/2}(a)]^{*})   .   Theorem 2. If   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are C*-algebras and    π  :   A  →   M   (  B  )        normal-:  π   normal-→  A    M  B      \pi:A\to M(B)   is a non-degenerate *-homomorphism (i.e.,    π   [  A  ]   B      π   delimited-[]  A   B    \pi[A]B   is a dense subset of   B   B   B   ), then we can uniquely extend   π   π   \pi   to a *-homomorphism     π  ¯   :    M   (  A  )    →   M   (  B  )        normal-:   normal-¯  π    normal-→    M  A     M  B      \overline{\pi}:M(A)\to M(B)   .  Theorem 3. If    ω  :   A  →  ℂ      normal-:  ω   normal-→  A  ℂ     \omega:A\to\mathbb{C}   is a state (i.e., a positive linear functional of norm   1   1   1   ) on   A   A   A   , then we can uniquely extend   ω   ω   \omega   to a state     ω  ¯   :    M   (  A  )    →  ℂ      normal-:   normal-¯  ω    normal-→    M  A   ℂ     \overline{\omega}:M(A)\to\mathbb{C}   on    M   (  A  )       M  A    M(A)   .  Definition (Locally compact quantum group). A (C*-algebraic) locally compact quantum group is an ordered pair    𝒢  =   (  A  ,  Δ  )       𝒢   A  normal-Δ     \mathcal{G}=(A,\Delta)   , where   A   A   A   is a C*-algebra and    Δ  :   A  →   M   (   A  ⊗  A   )        normal-:  normal-Δ   normal-→  A    M   tensor-product  A  A       \Delta:A\to M(A\otimes A)   is a non-degenerate *-homomorphism called the co-multiplication , that satisfies the following four conditions:   The co-multiplication is co-associative, i.e.,       Δ  ⊗  ι   ¯   ∘  Δ   =     ι  ⊗  Δ   ¯   ∘  Δ          normal-¯   tensor-product  normal-Δ  ι    normal-Δ      normal-¯   tensor-product  ι  normal-Δ    normal-Δ     \overline{\Delta\otimes\iota}\circ\Delta=\overline{\iota\otimes\Delta}\circ\Delta   .  The sets    {     ω  ⊗  id   ¯    (   Δ   (  a  )    )    |    ω  ∈   A  *    ,   a  ∈  A    }     conditional-set     normal-¯   tensor-product  ω  id      normal-Δ  a     formulae-sequence    ω   superscript  A       a  A      \left\{\overline{\omega\otimes\text{id}}(\Delta(a))~{}\big|~{}\omega\in A^{*},%
 ~{}a\in A\right\}   and    {     id  ⊗  ω   ¯    (   Δ   (  a  )    )    |    ω  ∈   A  *    ,   a  ∈  A    }     conditional-set     normal-¯   tensor-product  id  ω      normal-Δ  a     formulae-sequence    ω   superscript  A       a  A      \left\{\overline{\text{id}\otimes\omega}(\Delta(a))~{}\big|~{}\omega\in A^{*},%
 ~{}a\in A\right\}   are linearly dense subsets of   A   A   A   .  There exists a faithful K.M.S. weight   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   on   A   A   A   that is left-invariant, i.e.,      ϕ    (     ω  ⊗  id   ¯    (   Δ   (  a  )    )    )    =      ω  ¯    (   1   M   (  A  )     )    ⋅  ϕ    (  a  )          ϕ     normal-¯   tensor-product  ω  id      normal-Δ  a        normal-⋅     normal-¯  ω    subscript  1    M  A     ϕ   a     \phi\!\left(\overline{\omega\otimes\text{id}}(\Delta(a))\right)=\overline{%
 \omega}(1_{M(A)})\cdot\phi(a)   for all    ω  ∈   A  *       ω   superscript  A      \omega\in A^{*}   and    a  ∈   ℳ  ϕ  +       a   superscript   subscript  ℳ  ϕ       a\in\mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+}   .  There exists a K.M.S. weight   ψ   ψ   \psi   on   A   A   A   that is right-invariant, i.e.,      ψ    (     id  ⊗  ω   ¯    (   Δ   (  a  )    )    )    =      ω  ¯    (   1   M   (  A  )     )    ⋅  ψ    (  a  )          ψ     normal-¯   tensor-product  id  ω      normal-Δ  a        normal-⋅     normal-¯  ω    subscript  1    M  A     ψ   a     \psi\!\left(\overline{\text{id}\otimes\omega}(\Delta(a))\right)=\overline{%
 \omega}(1_{M(A)})\cdot\psi(a)   for all    ω  ∈   A  *       ω   superscript  A      \omega\in A^{*}   and    a  ∈   ℳ  ϕ  +       a   superscript   subscript  ℳ  ϕ       a\in\mathcal{M}_{\phi}^{+}   .   From the definition of a locally compact quantum group, it can be shown that the right-invariant K.M.S. weight   ψ   ψ   \psi   is automatically faithful. Therefore, the faithfulness of   ψ   ψ   \psi   is a redundant condition and does not need to be postulated.  Duality  The category of locally compact quantum groups allows for a dual construction with which one can prove that the bi-dual of a locally compact quantum group is isomorphic to the original one. This result gives a far-reaching generalization of Pontryagin duality for locally compact Hausdorff abelian groups.  Alternative Formulations  The theory has an equivalent formulation in terms of von Neumann algebras .  References   Johan Kustermans & Stefaan Vaes.
