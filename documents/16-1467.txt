Fink protocol

The Fink protocol1 (also known as Successive Pairs2 or Lone Chooser3) is a protocol for proportional division of a cake.
Its main advantage is that it can work in an online fashion, without knowing the number of partners in advance. When a new partner joins the party, the existing division is adjusted to give a fair share to the new comer, with minimal effect on existing partners.
Its main disadvantage is that, instead of giving each partner a single connected piece, it gives each partner a large number of "crumbs".
Protocol
We describe the protocol inductively for an increasing number of partners.
When partner #1 enters the party, he just takes the entire cake. His value is thus 1.
When partner #2 comes, partner #1 cuts the cake to two pieces that are equal in his eyes. The new partner chooses the piece that is better in his eyes. The value of each partner is thus at least 1/2 (just like in the divide and choose protocol).
When partner #3 joins, both partners #1 and #2 cut their share to 3 pieces that are equal in their eyes. The new partner choose one piece from each partner. The value of each of partners #1 and #2 is at least 2/3 of their previous value, which was 1/2. Hence their new value is at least 1/3. The value of partner #3 is at least 1/3 from the piece of #1 and 1/3 from the piece of 2, which gives him at least 1/3 of the total cake.
In general, when partner #i enters the party, the previous i-1 partners divide their share to i equal pieces and the new partner picks a piece from each pile. Again it is possible to prove that the value of each partner is at least 1/n of the total, so the division is proportional.
Number of cuts
Straightforward use of the algorithm would generate 
 
 
 
  pieces, but in fact only about 
 
 
 
  are needed as each partner only really needs to do 
 
 
 
  cuts when the 
 
 
th partner comes along.
Applications
Fink's protocol is used in a subroutine in other cake-cutting protocols:

Woodall's protocol for super-proportional division for n players.
Austin moving-knife procedure, giving each partner a piece that he values as exactly 
 
 
 
  of the total.
