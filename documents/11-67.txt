   D-alanine—alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate) ligase      D-alanine—alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate) ligase   In enzymology , a D-alanine—alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate) ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + D-alanine + alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate)   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + D-alanyl-alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate)   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , D-alanine , and alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate) , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and D-alanyl-alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds as acid-D-amino-acid ligases (peptide synthases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-alanine:alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate) ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include D-alanyl-alanyl-poly(glycerolphosphate) synthetase , D-alanine:membrane-acceptor ligase , D-alanylalanylpoly(phosphoglycerol) synthetase , D-alanyl-poly(phosphoglycerol) synthetase , and D-alanine-membrane acceptor-ligase . This enzyme participates in d-alanine metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 6.3.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
