   SINADR      SINADR   Signal-to-noise and distortion ratio ( SINADR 1 ) is a measurement of the purity of a signal. SINADR is typically used in data converter specifications. SINADR is defined as:      SINADR  =    P  signal     P  quantizationError   +   P  randomNoise   +   P  distortion         SINADR     subscript  P  signal      subscript  P  quantizationError    subscript  P  randomNoise    subscript  P  distortion       \mathrm{SINADR}=\frac{P_{\mathrm{signal}}}{P_{\mathrm{quantizationError}}+P_{%
 \mathrm{randomNoise}}+P_{\mathrm{distortion}}}   where   P   P   P   is the average power of the signal , quantization error , random noise and distortion components. SINADR is usually expressed in dB . SINADR is a standard metric for analog-to-digital converter and digital-to-analog converter .  SINADR (in dB) is related to ENOB by the following equation:      SINADR  =     E  N  O  B   ⋅  6.02   +  1.76       SINADR     normal-⋅    E  N  O  B   6.02   1.76     \mathrm{SINADR}=ENOB\cdot 6.02+1.76     References  See also   Signal-to-noise ratio  ENOB   "  Category:Electronics  Category:Digital signal processing     ↩
