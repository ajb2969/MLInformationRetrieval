3, [5,3[3]] |- |Properties||Regular, quasiregular |} The order-6 dodecahedral honeycomb is one of 11 paracompact regular honeycombs in hyperbolic 3-space. It is called paracompact because it has infinite vertex figures, with all vertices as ideal points at infinity. It has Schläfli symbol {5,3,6}, being composed of dodecahedral cells, each edge of the honeycomb is surrounded by six dodecahedra. Each vertex is ideal and surrounded by infinitely many dodecahedra with a vertex figure as a triangular tiling.
Symmetry
A half symmetry construction exists as  with alternately colored dodecahedral cells.
Images





 The model is cell-centered in the within Poincaré disk model, with the viewpoint then placed at the origin.



It is similar to the 2D hyperbolic infinite-order pentagonal tiling, {5,∞} with pentagonal faces. All vertices are on the ideal surface.
