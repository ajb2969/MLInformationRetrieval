3beta-hydroxy-5beta-steroid dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a 3beta-hydroxy-5beta-steroid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnane-20-one + NADP+

 
  5beta-pregnan-3,20-dione + NADPH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3beta-hydroxy-5beta-pregnane-20-one and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are 5beta-pregnan-3,20-dione, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3beta-hydroxy-5beta-steroid:NADP+ 3-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include 3beta-hydroxysteroid 5beta-oxidoreductase, and 3beta-hydroxysteroid 5beta-progesterone oxidoreductase.
