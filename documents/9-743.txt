Conic optimization

Conic optimization is a subfield of convex optimization that studies a class of structured convex optimization problems called conic optimization problems. A conic optimization problem consists of minimizing a convex function over the intersection of an affine subspace and a convex cone.
The class of conic optimization problems is a subclass of convex optimization problems and it includes some of the most well known classes of convex optimization problems, namely linear and semidefinite programming.
Definition
Given a real vector space X, a convex, real-valued function



defined on a convex cone

 
 , and an affine subspace 
 
 
 
  defined by a set of affine constraints 
 
 
 
 , a conic optimization problem is to find the point 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  for which the number 
 
 
 
  is smallest.
Examples of 
 
 
 
  include the positive orthant

 
 , positive semidefinite matrices 
 
 
 
 , and the second-order cone

 
 . Often 
 
 
 
  is a linear function, in which case the conic optimization problem reduces to a semidefinite program, a linear program, and a second order cone program, respectively.
Duality
Certain special cases of conic optimization problems have notable closed-form expressions of their dual problems.
