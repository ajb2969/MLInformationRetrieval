   Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem      Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem   In mathematics , the Schwarz–Ahlfors–Pick theorem is an extension of the Schwarz lemma for hyperbolic geometry , such as the Poincaré half-plane model .  The Schwarz–Pick lemma states that every holomorphic function from the unit disk  U to itself, or from the upper half-plane  H to itself, will not increase the Poincaré distance between points. The unit disk U with the Poincaré metric has negative Gaussian curvature −1. In 1938, Lars Ahlfors generalised the lemma to maps from the unit disk to other negatively curved surfaces:  Theorem ( Schwarz – Ahlfors – Pick ). Let U be the unit disk with Poincaré metric   ρ   ρ   \rho   ; let S be a Riemann surface endowed with a Hermitian metric    σ   σ   \sigma   whose Gaussian curvature is ≤ −1; let    f  :   U  →  S      normal-:  f   normal-→  U  S     f:U\rightarrow S   be a holomorphic function . Then       σ   (   f   (   z  1   )    ,   f   (   z  2   )    )    ≤   ρ   (   z  1   ,   z  2   )          σ     f   subscript  z  1      f   subscript  z  2        ρ    subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2       \sigma(f(z_{1}),f(z_{2}))\leq\rho(z_{1},z_{2})   for all       z  1   ,   z  2    ∈  U   .        subscript  z  1    subscript  z  2    U    z_{1},z_{2}\in U.     A generalization of this theorem was proved by Shing-Tung Yau in 1973. 1  References  "  Category:Hyperbolic geometry  Category:Riemann surfaces  Category:Theorems in complex analysis  Category:Theorems in differential geometry     ↩
