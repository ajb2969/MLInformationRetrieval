   Seminormal ring      Seminormal ring   In algebra , a seminormal ring is a commutative  reduced ring in which, whenever x , y satisfy     x  3   =   y  2        superscript  x  3    superscript  y  2     x^{3}=y^{2}   , there is s with     s  2   =  x       superscript  s  2   x    s^{2}=x   and     s  3   =  y       superscript  s  3   y    s^{3}=y   . This definition was given by  as a simplification of the original definition of . A basic example is an integrally closed domain .  A semigroup is said to be seminormal if its semigroup algebra is seminormal.
