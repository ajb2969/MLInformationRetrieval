   Joseph A. Thas      Joseph A. Thas   Joseph Adolphe François Thas (born 13 October 1944, Dilbeek , Belgium ) is a Belgian mathematician, who works on combinatorics , incidence geometry and finite geometries .  Thas received in 1969 his PhD from Ghent University under Julien Bilo with thesis Een studie betreffende de projective rechte over de totale matrix algebra     M  3    (  K  )        subscript  M  3   K    M_{3}(K)   der 3x3-matrices met elementen in een algebraïsch afgesloten veld K . 1 2 He is an emeritus professor at Ghent University.  Awards and honors  In 1994 Thas received the Euler medal . In 1998 he was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin with lecture Finite geometries, varieties and codes . He received in 1969 the prize of the Royal Academy of Sciences, Letters and Fine Arts of Belgium , in 1970 the Scientific Louis Empain Award and in the same year the François Deruyts prize of the Royal Academy of Belgium .  In 1988 he became a member of the Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts ; he was vice-director of the Class of Sciences in 1998 and director in 1999. In 1999 he was awarded an Erskine Fellowship of the University of Canterbury , New Zealand , in 2008 he was Platinum Jubilee Lecturer at the Indian Statistical Institute , and in 2012 he became one of the inaugural fellows of the American Mathematical Society . 3  Selected works   with Koen Thas, H.
