   Transfer-matrix method      Transfer-matrix method   In physics and mathematics , the transfer-matrix method is a general technique for solving problems in statistical mechanics.  The basic idea is to write the partition function in the form      𝒵  =    𝐯  0   ⋅   {    ∏   k  =  1   N    𝐖  k    }   ⋅   𝐯   N  +  1         𝒵   normal-⋅   subscript  𝐯  0      superscript   subscript  product    k  1    N    subscript  𝐖  k      subscript  𝐯    N  1       \mathcal{Z}=\mathbf{v}_{0}\cdot\left\{\prod_{k=1}^{N}\mathbf{W}_{k}\right\}%
 \cdot\mathbf{v}_{N+1}     where v 0 and v N are vectors of dimension p and the pxp matrices W k are the so-called transfer matrices . In some cases, particularly for cyclic systems, the partition function may be written more simply as      𝒵  =   tr   {    ∏   k  =  1   N    𝐖  k    }        𝒵    tr     superscript   subscript  product    k  1    N    subscript  𝐖  k        \mathcal{Z}=\mathrm{tr}\left\{\prod_{k=1}^{N}\mathbf{W}_{k}\right\}     where "tr" denotes the matrix trace . In either case, the partition function may be solved exactly using eigenanalysis . If the matrices are all the same matrix W , the partition function may be approximated as the N th power of the largest eigenvalue of W , since the trace is the sum of the eigenvalues and the eigenvalues of the product of two diagonal matrices equals the product of their individual eigenvalues.  The transfer-matrix method is used when the total system can be broken into a sequence of subsystems that interact only with adjacent subsystems. For example, a three-dimensional cubical lattice of spins in an Ising model can be decomposed into a sequence of two-dimensional planar lattices of spins that interact only adjacently. The dimension p of the pxp transfer matrix equals the number of states the subsystem may have; the transfer matrix itself W k encodes the statistical weight associated with a particular state of subsystem k-1 being next to another state of subsystem k .  As an example of observables that can be calculated from this method, the probability of a particular state   m   m   m   occurring at position x is given by:        Pr  m    (  x  )    =    tr   [    ∏   k  =  1   x     𝐖  k   𝐏𝐣    ∏    k  ′   =   x  +  1    N    𝐖   k  ′       ]     tr   [    ∏   k  =  1   N    𝐖  k    ]            subscript  Pr  normal-m   normal-x       tr   delimited-[]    superscript   subscript  product    k  1    x      subscript  𝐖  k   𝐏𝐣    superscript   subscript  product     superscript  k  normal-′     x  1     N    subscript  𝐖   superscript  k  normal-′           tr   delimited-[]    superscript   subscript  product    k  1    N    subscript  𝐖  k         \mathrm{Pr_{m}(x)}=\frac{\mathrm{tr}\left[\prod_{k=1}^{x}\mathbf{W}_{k}\mathbf%
 {Pj}\prod_{k^{\prime}=x+1}^{N}\mathbf{W}_{k^{\prime}}\right]}{\mathrm{tr}\left%
 [\prod_{k=1}^{N}\mathbf{W}_{k}\right]}     Where    P  j      P  j    Pj   is the projection matrix for state   m   m   m   , having elements     P   j   μ  ν     =    δ   μ  ν     δ   μ  m           P   subscript  j    μ  ν        subscript  δ    μ  ν     subscript  δ    μ  m       Pj_{\mu\nu}=\delta_{\mu\nu}\delta_{\mu m}     Transfer-matrix methods have been critical for many exact solutions of problems in statistical mechanics , including the Zimm-Bragg and Lifson-Roig models of the helix-coil transition , transfer matrix models for protein-DNA binding , as well as the famous exact solution of the two-dimensional Ising model by Lars Onsager .
