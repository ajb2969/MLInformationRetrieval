   Deoxyadenosine kinase      Deoxyadenosine kinase   In enzymology , a deoxyadenosine kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + deoxyadenosine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + dAMP   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and deoxyadenosine , whereas its two products are ADP and dAMP .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:deoxyadenosine 5'-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called purine-deoxyribonucleoside kinase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
