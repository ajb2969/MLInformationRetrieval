   Single vegetative obstruction model      Single vegetative obstruction model   The ITU Single Vegetative Obstruction Model is a Radio propagation model that quantitatively approximates the attenuation due to the vegetation in the middle of a telecommunication link.  Applicable to/under conditions  The model is applicable to scenarios where no end of the link is completely inside foliage, but a single plant or tree stands in the middle of the link.  Coverage  Frequency = Below 3 GHz and Over 5 GHz Depth = Not specified  Mathematical formulations  The single vegetative obstruction model is formally expressed as,      A  =   {       d  γ  , frequency   <   3  G  H  z             R  f    d    +   k   [   1  -   e    (    R  f   -   R  i    )    d  k      ]   , frequency    >   5  G  H  z             A   cases      d  γ  , frequency     3  G  H  z    otherwise         subscript  R  f   d     k   delimited-[]    1   superscript  e       subscript  R  f    subscript  R  i      d  k       , frequency      5  G  H  z    otherwise     A=\begin{cases}d\gamma\mbox{ , frequency}<3GHz\\
 R_{f}d\;+\;k[1-e^{(R_{f}-R_{i})\frac{d}{k}}]\mbox{ , frequency}>5GHz\end{cases}     where, A = The Attenuation due to vegetation. Unit: decibel (dB).  d = Depth of foliage. Unit: Meter (m).     γ   γ   \gamma   = Specific attenuation for short vegetative paths. Unit: decibel per meter (dB/m).  R i = The initial slope of the attenuation curve.  R f = The final slope of the attenuation curve.  f = The frequency of operations. Unit: gigahertz (GHz).  k = Empirical  constant .  Calculation of slopes  Initial slope is calculated as:        R  i    =   a  f        subscript  R  i     a  f     R_{i}\;=\;af     And the final slope as:        R  f    =   b   f  c         subscript  R  f     b   superscript  f  c      R_{f}\;=\;bf^{c}     where,  a , b and c are empirical constants (given in the table below).  Calculation of k  k is computed as:      k  =     k  0    -    10    log   [     A  0     (    1   -   e    -   A  i     A  0      )    (   1  -   e    R  f   f     )    ]          k     subscript  k  0     10       subscript  A  0     1   superscript  e       superscript  A  i     subscript  A  0        1   superscript  e     subscript  R  f   f           k=k_{0}\;-\;10\;\log{[A_{0}\;(1\;-\;e^{\frac{-A^{i}}{A_{0}}})(1-e^{R_{f}f})]}     where,  k 0 = Empirical constant (given in the table below).  R f = Empirical constant for frequency dependent attenuation.  A 0 = Empirical attenuation constant (given in the table below).  A i = Illumination area.  Calculation of A i  A i is calculated in using any of the equations below. A point to note is that, the terms h , h T , h R , w , w T and w R are defined perpendicular to the (assumed horizontal) line joining the transmitter and receiver. The first three terms are measured vertically and the other thee are measured horizontally.

The total path loss includes other factors like free space loss which is not included in this model.  Over 5 GHz, the equations suddenly become extremely complex in consideration of the equations for below 3 GHz. Also, this model does not work for frequency between 3 GHz and 5 GHz.
