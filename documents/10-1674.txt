   Mannose isomerase      Mannose isomerase   In enzymology , a mannose isomerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-mannose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-fructose   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-mannose , and one product , D-fructose .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically those intramolecular oxidoreductases interconverting aldoses and ketoses . The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-mannose aldose-ketose-isomerase . Other names in common use include D-mannose isomerase , and D-mannose ketol-isomerase . This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 5.3.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
