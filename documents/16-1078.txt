Entropy v/s Mach number graph is as shown in the figure (for k=1.4):  (Figure)  In accordance with the second law of thermodynamics adiabatic frictional flow always approaches Ma=1 in a constant area duct. The value of friction factor doesn't affect the computed curve   Entropy is maximum at Ma=1 so sonic point is eventually achieved by virtue of second law. Since    p  o     subscript  p  o    p_{o}   and    ρ  o     subscript  ρ  o    \rho_{o}   decrease along the flow in this case, the sonic properties (p*, ῥ*, T*,    p  o  *     subscript   superscript  p    o    p^{*}_{o}   , and    ρ  o  *     subscript   superscript  ρ    o    \rho^{*}_{o}   ) are considered as references.

Choking due to friction  (Figure)  Behavior of duct flow with a nominal supersonic inlet condition Ma = 3.0: (a) L/D  L*/D, normal shock at Ma = 2.0 with subsonic flow then accelerating to sonic exit point; (c) L/D = 53, shock must now occur at Ma = 2.5; (d) L/D > 63, flow must be entirely subsonic and choked at exit.   Choking of duct is basically reduction of duct mass flow. The flow conditions change if the actual length L is greater than the predicted maximum length L*, and there are two classifications :  Subsonic inlet  If L > L*(Ma1), the flow slows down until an inlet Mach number Ma2 is reached such that L = L*(Ma2). The exit flow is sonic, and the mass flow has been reduced by frictional choking. Further increases in duct length will continue to decrease the inlet Ma and mass flow.  Supersonic inlet  Friction have a very large impact on supersonic duct flow. Even an infinite inlet Mach number will be reduced to sonic conditions in only 41 diameters for f = 0.02. Let us consider an example inlet Ma = 3.0 and f=0.02. For this condition L*=26 di ameters. If L is increased beyond 26D, the flow will not choke but a normal shock will form at just the right place for the subsequent subsonic frictional flow to become sonic exactly at the exit. Eventually, a very long duct will cause the feednozzle throat to become choked, thus reducing the duct mass flow. Thus supersonic friction changes the flow pattern if L > L* but does not choke the flow until L is much larger than L*.  References    "  Category:Fluid dynamics
