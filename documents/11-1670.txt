   Multiplicative partition      Multiplicative partition   In number theory , a multiplicative partition or unordered factorization of an integer n that is greater than 1 is a way of writing n as a product of integers greater than 1, treating two products as equivalent if they differ only in the ordering of the factors. The number n is itself considered one of these products. Multiplicative partitions closely parallel the study of multipartite partitions , discussed in , which are additive partitions of finite sequences of positive integers, with the addition made pointwise . Although the study of multiplicative partitions has been ongoing since at least 1923, the name "multiplicative partition" appears to have been introduced by . The Latin name "factorisatio numerorum" had been used previously. MathWorld uses the term unordered factorization .  Examples   The number 20 has four multiplicative partitions: 2 × 2 × 5, 2 × 10, 4 × 5, and 20.  3 × 3 × 3 × 3, 3 × 3 × 9, 3 × 27, 9 × 9, and 81 are the five multiplicative partitions of 81 = 3 4 . Because it is the fourth power of a prime , 81 has the same number (five) of multiplicative partitions as 4 does of additive partitions .  The number 30 has five multiplicative partitions: 2 × 3 × 5 = 2 × 15 = 6 × 5 = 3 × 10 = 30.  In general, the number of multiplicative partitions of a squarefree number with i prime factors is the ith Bell number , B i .   Application  describe an application of multiplicative partitions in classifying integers with a given number of divisors. For example, the integers with exactly 12 divisors take the forms p 11 , p × q 5 , p 2 × q 3 , and p × q × r 2 , where p , q , and r are distinct prime numbers ; these forms correspond to the multiplicative partitions 12, 2×6, 3×4, and 2×2×3 respectively. More generally, for each multiplicative partition      k  =   ∏   t  i        k   product   subscript  t  i      k=\prod t_{i}   of the integer k , there corresponds a class of integers having exactly k divisors, of the form       ∏   p  i    t  i   -  1     ,     product   superscript   subscript  p  i      subscript  t  i   1      \prod p_{i}^{t_{i}-1},   where each p i is a distinct prime. This correspondence follows from the multiplicative property of the divisor function .  Bounds on the number of partitions  credits  with the problem of counting the number of multiplicative partitions of n ; this problem has since been studied by other others under the Latin name of factorisatio numerorum . If the number of multiplicative partitions of n is a n , McMahon and Oppenheim observed that its Dirichlet series generating function ƒ( s ) has the product representation        f   (  s  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     a  n    n  s     =    ∏   k  =  2   ∞    1   1  -   k   -  s        .          f  s     superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  a  n    superscript  n  s            superscript   subscript  product    k  2        1    1   superscript  k    s          f(s)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{n^{s}}=\prod_{k=2}^{\infty}\frac{1}{1-k^{%
 -s}}.     The sequence of numbers a n begins   1, 1, 1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2, 1, 4, 1, 2, 2, 5, ... .   Oppenheim also claimed an upper bound on a n , of the form        a  n   ≤   n    (   exp    log   n   log   log   log  n        log   log  n      )     -  2   +   o   (  1  )        ,       subscript  a  n     n   superscript          n        n           n          2     o  1        a_{n}\leq n\left(\exp\frac{\log n\log\log\log n}{\log\log n}\right)^{-2+o(1)},   but as  showed, this bound is erroneous and the true bound is        a  n   ≤   n    (   exp    log   n   log   log   log  n        log   log  n      )     -  1   +   o   (  1  )        .       subscript  a  n     n   superscript          n        n           n          1     o  1        a_{n}\leq n\left(\exp\frac{\log n\log\log\log n}{\log\log n}\right)^{-1+o(1)}.     Both of these bounds are not far from linear in n : they are of the form n 1−o(1) . However, the typical value of a n is much smaller: the average value of a n , averaged over an interval x ≤ n ≤ x + N , is        a  ¯   =   exp   (     4    log  N        2  e     log   log  N       (   1  +   o   (  1  )     )    )     ,       normal-¯  a           4      N           2  e        N        1    o  1        \bar{a}=\exp\left(\frac{4\sqrt{\log N}}{\sqrt{2e}\log\log N}\bigl(1+o(1)\bigr)%
 \right),   a bound that is of the form n o(1) .  Additional results  observe, and  prove, that most numbers cannot arise as the number a n of multiplicative partitions of some n : the number of values less than N which arise in this way is N O(log log log N / log log N ) . Additionally,  show that most values of n are not multiples of a n : the number of values n ≤ N such that a n divides n is O( N / log 1 + o(1)  N ).
