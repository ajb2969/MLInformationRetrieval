   16S rRNA (guanine527-N7)-methyltransferase      16S rRNA (guanine527-N7)-methyltransferase   16S rRNA (guanine 527 -N 7 )-methyltransferase (, ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase G , 16S rRNA methyltransferase RsmG , GidB , rsmG (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (guanine 527 -N 7 )-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine 527 in 16S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N7-methylguanine 527 in 16S rRNA   The enzyme specifically methylates guanine 527 at N 7 in 16S rRNA.
