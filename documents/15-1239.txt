16S rRNA (guanine527-N7)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (guanine527-N7)-methyltransferase (, ribosomal RNA small subunit methyltransferase G, 16S rRNA methyltransferase RsmG, GidB, rsmG (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (guanine527-N7)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanine527 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N7-methylguanine527 in 16S rRNA
 

The enzyme specifically methylates guanine527 at N7 in 16S rRNA.
