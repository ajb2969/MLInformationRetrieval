Albert Ingham

Albert Edward Ingham FRS (3 April 1900 – 6 September 1967) was an English mathematician.1
Education
Ingham was born in Northampton. He went to Stafford Grammar School and Trinity College, Cambridge.2
Research
Ingham supervised the Ph.D.s of C. Brian Haselgrove, Wolfgang Fuchs and Christopher Hooley.3 Ingham died in Chamonix, France.
Ingham proved in 19374 that if



for some positive constant c, then



for any θ > (1+4c)/(2+4c). Here ζ denotes the Riemann zeta function and π the prime-counting function.
Using the best published value for c at the time, an immediate consequence of his result was that

gn n5/8,
 

where pn the n-th prime number and gn = pn+1 − pn denotes the n-th prime gap.
