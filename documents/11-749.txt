   N-acyl-D-glutamate deacylase      N-acyl-D-glutamate deacylase   In enzymology , a N-acyl-D-glutamate deacylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-acyl-D-glutamate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   a carboxylate + D-glutamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-acyl-D-glutamate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are carboxylate and D-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acyl-D-glutamate amidohydrolase . It employs one cofactor , zinc .
