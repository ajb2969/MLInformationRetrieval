   Griffiths group      Griffiths group   In mathematics, more specifically in algebraic geometry , the Griffiths group of a projective  complex manifold  X measures the difference between homological equivalence and algebraic equivalence, which are two important equivalence relations of algebraic cycles .  More precisely, it is defined as        Griff  k    (  X  )    :=      Z  k     (  X  )   hom    /   Z  k      (  X  )   alg       assign    superscript  Griff  k   X          superscript  Z  k    subscript  X  hom     superscript  Z  k     subscript  X  alg      \operatorname{Griff}^{k}(X):=Z^{k}(X)_{\mathrm{hom}}/Z^{k}(X)_{\mathrm{alg}}     where     Z  k    (  X  )        superscript  Z  k   X    Z^{k}(X)   denotes the group of algebraic cycles of some fixed codimension  k and the subscripts indicate the groups that are homologically trivial, respectively algebraically equivalent to zero. 1  This group was introduced by Phillip Griffiths who showed that for a general quintic in    ùêè  4     superscript  ùêè  4    \mathbf{P}^{4}   (projective 4-space), the group     Griff  2    (  X  )       superscript  Griff  2   X    \operatorname{Griff}^{2}(X)   is not a torsion group.
