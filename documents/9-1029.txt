   Hemi-icosahedron      Hemi-icosahedron   A hemi-icosahedron is an abstract regular polyhedron , containing half the faces of a regular icosahedron . It can be realized as a projective polyhedron (a tessellation of the real projective plane by 10 triangles), which can be visualized by constructing the projective plane as a hemisphere where opposite points along the boundary are connected and dividing the hemisphere into three equal parts.  Geometry  It has 10 triangular faces, 15 edges, and 6 vertices.  It is also related to the nonconvex uniform polyhedron , the tetrahemihexahedron , which could be topologically identical to the hemi-icosahedron if each of the 3 square faces were divided into two triangles.  Graphs  It can be represented symmetrically on faces, and vertices as schlegel diagrams :     (Figure)  Hemi-icosahedron.png      Face-centered     The complete graph K6  It has the same vertices and edges as the 5-dimensional 5-simplex which has a complete graph of edges, but only contains half of the (20) faces.  From the point of view of graph theory this is an embedding of    K  6     subscript  K  6    K_{6}   (the complete graph with 6 vertices) on a real projective plane . With this embedding, the dual graph is the Petersen graph --- see hemi-dodecahedron .
