   Stoneham number      Stoneham number   In mathematics , the Stoneham numbers are a certain class of real numbers , named after mathematician  Richard G. Stoneham (1920–1996). For coprime numbers b , c > 1, the Stoneham number α b , c is defined as       α   b  ,  c    =    ∑   n  =   c  k   >  1     1    b  n   n     =    ∑   k  =  1   ∞    1    b   c  k     c  k             subscript  α   b  c      subscript       n   superscript  c  k        1       1     superscript  b  n   n            superscript   subscript     k  1        1     superscript  b   superscript  c  k     superscript  c  k         \alpha_{b,c}=\sum_{n=c^{k}>1}\frac{1}{b^{n}n}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{b^{c%
 ^{k}}c^{k}}     It was shown by Stoneham in 1973 that α b , c is b - normal whenever c is an odd prime and b is a primitive root of c 2 .  References       "  Category:Number theory  Category:Sets of real numbers
