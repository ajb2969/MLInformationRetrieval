   Spring (mathematics)      Spring (mathematics)   In geometry , a spring is a surface in the shape of a coiled tube, generated by sweeping a circle about the path of a helix .  Definition  A spring wrapped around the z- axis can be defined parametrically by:        x   (  u  ,  v  )    =    (   R  +   r   cos  v     )    cos  u     ,        x   u  v        R    r    v       u      x(u,v)=\left(R+r\cos{v}\right)\cos{u},           y   (  u  ,  v  )    =    (   R  +   r   cos  v     )    sin  u     ,        y   u  v        R    r    v       u      y(u,v)=\left(R+r\cos{v}\right)\sin{u},           z   (  u  ,  v  )    =    r   sin  v    +    P  ⋅  u   π     ,        z   u  v        r    v       normal-⋅  P  u   π      z(u,v)=r\sin{v}+{P\cdot u\over\pi},     where      u  ∈   [  0  ,  2  n  π  )    (  n  ∈  ℝ  )   ,     fragments  u    fragments  normal-[  0  normal-,  2  n  π  normal-)    fragments  normal-(  n   R  normal-)   normal-,    u\in[0,\ 2n\pi)\ \left(n\in\mathbb{R}\right),          v  ∈   [  0  ,   2  π   )    ,      v   0    2  π      v\in[0,\ 2\pi),         R    R   R\,   is the distance from the center of the tube to the center of the helix ,      r    r   r\,   is the radius of the tube,      P    P   P\,   is the speed of the movement along the z axis (in a right-handed  Cartesian coordinate system , positive values create right-handed springs, whereas negative values create left-handed springs),      n    n   n\,   is the number of rounds in circle.  The implicit function in Cartesian coordinates for a spring wrapped around the z- axis , with   n   n   n   = 1 is          (   R  -     x  2   +   y  2      )   2   +    (   z  +    P   arctan   (   x  /  y   )     π    )   2    =   r  2    .         superscript    R       superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2      2    superscript    z      P      x  y     π    2     superscript  r  2     \left(R-\sqrt{x^{2}+y^{2}}\right)^{2}+\left(z+{P\arctan(x/y)\over\pi}\right)^{%
 2}=r^{2}.     The interior volume of the spiral is given by       V  =   2   π  2   n  R   r  2    =    (   π   r  2    )    (   2  π  n  R   )     .        V    2   superscript  π  2   n  R   superscript  r  2             π   superscript  r  2      2  π  n  R       V=2\pi^{2}nRr^{2}=\left(\pi r^{2}\right)\left(2\pi nR\right).\,     Other definitions  Note that the previous definition uses a vertical circular cross section. This is not entirely accurate as the tube becomes increasingly distorted as the Torsion 1 increases (ratio of the speed    P    P   P\,   and the incline of the tube).  An alternative would be to have a circular cross section in the plane perpendicular to the helix curve. This would be closer to the shape of a physical spring. The mathematics would be much more complicated.  The torus can be viewed as a special case of the spring obtained when the helix degenerates to a circle.
