   Methylglyoxal reductase (NADH-dependent)      Methylglyoxal reductase (NADH-dependent)   In enzymology , a methylglyoxal reductase (NADH-dependent) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-lactaldehyde + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   methylglyoxal + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-lactaldehyde and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are methylglyoxal , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-lactaldehyde:NAD + oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include methylglyoxal reductase , and D-lactaldehyde dehydrogenase . This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
