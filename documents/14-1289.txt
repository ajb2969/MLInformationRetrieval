Askey scheme

In mathematics, the Askey scheme is a way of organizing orthogonal polynomials of hypergeometric or basic hypergeometric type into a hierarchy. For the classical orthogonal polynomials discussed in , the Askey scheme was first drawn by  and by , and has since been extended by  and  to cover basic orthogonal polynomials.
Askey scheme for hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials
give the following version of the Askey scheme:

4F3: Wilson | Racah
3F2: Continuous dual Hahn | Continuous Hahn | Hahn | dual Hahn
2F1: Meixner–Pollaczek | Jacobi | Pseudo Jacobi | Meixner | Krawtchouk
2F0/1F1: Laguerre | Bessel | Charlier
1F0: Hermite

Askey scheme for basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials
give the following scheme for basic hypergeometric orthogonal polynomials:
