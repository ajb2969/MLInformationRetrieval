Bonnesen's inequality

Bonnesen's inequality is an inequality relating the length, the area, the radius of the incircle and the radius of the circumcircle of a Jordan curve. It is a strengthening of the classical isoperimetric inequality.
More precisely, consider a planar simple closed curve of length 
 
 
 
  bounding a domain of area 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  denote the radii of the incircle and the circumcircle. Bonnesen proved the inequality



The term 
 
 
 
  in the left hand side is known as the isoperimetric defect.
Loewner's torus inequality with isosystolic defect is a systolic analogue of Bonnesen's inequality.
