Bochner's formula

In mathematics, Bochner's formula is a statement relating harmonic functions on a Riemannian manifold

 
  to the Ricci curvature.
Formal statement
More specifically, if 
 
 
 
  is a harmonic function (i.e., 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the Laplacian with respect to 
 
 
 
 ), then


 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the gradient of 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
 .1 Bochner used this formula to prove the Bochner vanishing theorem.
