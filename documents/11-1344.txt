O-dihydroxycoumarin 7-O-glucosyltransferase




O-dihydroxycoumarin 7-O-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, an o-dihydroxycoumarin 7-O-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin 
 
 
 
  UDP + daphnin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and 7,8-dihydroxycoumarin, whereas its two products are UDP and daphnin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:7,8-dihydroxycoumarin 7-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-o-dihydroxycoumarin, 7-O-glucosyltransferase, and UDP-glucose:o-dihydroxycoumarin glucosyltransferase.
