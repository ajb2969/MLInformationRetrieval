   Security characteristic line      Security characteristic line    Security characteristic line (SCL) is a regression line, 1 plotting performance of a particular security or portfolio against that of the market portfolio at every point in time. The SCL is plotted on a graph where the Y-axis is the excess return on a security over the risk-free return and the X-axis is the excess return of the market in general. The slope of the SCL is the security's beta , and the intercept is its alpha . 2  Formula      SCL  :     R   i  ,  t    -   R  f    =    α  i   +     β  i     (    R   M  ,  t    -   R  f    )    +   ϵ   i  ,  t         normal-:  SCL       subscript  R   i  t     subscript  R  f       subscript  α  i      subscript  β  i      subscript  R   M  t     subscript  R  f      subscript  ϵ   i  t        \mathrm{SCL}:R_{i,t}-R_{f}=\alpha_{i}+\beta_{i}\,(R_{M,t}-R_{f})+\epsilon_{i,t}     where:   α i is called the asset's alpha (abnormal return)  β i (R M,t – R f ) is a nondiversifiable or systematic risk  ε i,t is the non-systematic or diversifiable, non-market or idiosyncratic risk  R M,t is a market risk  R f is a risk-free rate   See also   Security market line  Capital allocation line  Capital market line  Modern portfolio theory   References  External links   CAPM and the Characteristic Line  Chapter 7 CAPM {link doesn't work}  Chapter 13 {link doesn't work}   "  Category:Investment     Characteristic Line ↩  Security Characteristic Line ↩
