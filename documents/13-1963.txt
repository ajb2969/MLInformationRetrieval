Specific radiative intensity

Specific (radiative) intensity is a quantity used in physics that describes electromagnetic radiation. It is a term used in much of the older scientific literature. The present-day SI term is spectral radiance, which can be expressed in base SI units as .
It gives a full radiometric description of the field of classical electromagnetic radiation of any kind, including thermal radiation and light. It is conceptually distinct from the descriptions in explicit terms of Maxwellian electromagnetic fields or of photon distribution. It refers to material physics as distinct from psychophysics.
For the concept of specific intensity, the line of propagation of radiation lies in a semi-transparent medium which varies continuously in its optical properties. The concept refers to an area, projected from the element of source area into a plane at right angles to the line of propagation, and to an element of solid angle subtended by the detector at the element of source area.1234567
The term brightness is also sometimes been used for this concept.89 The SI system states that the word brightness should not be so used, but should instead refer only to psychophysics. 
Definition
The specific (radiative) intensity is a quantity that describes the rate of radiative transfer of energy at , a point of space with coordinates 
 
 
 
 , at time 
 
 
 
 . It is a scalar-valued function of four variables, customarily101112131415 written as




where:



 
  denotes frequency.
 
 denotes a unit vector, with the direction and sense of the geometrical vector 
 
 
 
  in the line of propagation from
 
the effective source point , to
 
a detection point .
 

 is defined to be such that a virtual source area,  , containing the point  , is an apparent emitter of a small but finite amount of energy 
 
 
 
  transported by radiation of frequencies 
 
 
 
  in a small time duration 
 
 
 
  , where

 I (x, t ; r1, ν) cos θ1 dA1 dΩ1 dν dt}} ,
 

and where  is the angle between the line of propagation 
 
 
 
  and the normal  to  ; the effective destination of 
 
 
 
  is a finite small area  , containing the point  , that defines a finite small solid angle  about  in the direction of 
 
 
 
  . The cosine accounts for the projection of the source area  into a plane at right angles to the line of propagation indicated by 
 
 
 
  .
The use of the differential notation for areas  indicates they are very small compared to , the square of the magnitude of vector 
 
 
 
 , and thus the solid angles  are also small.
There is no radiation that is attributed to  itself as its source, because  is a geometrical point with no magnitude. A finite area is needed to emit a finite amount of light.
Invariance
For propagation of light in a vacuum, the definition of specific (radiative) intensity implicitly allows for the inverse square law of radiative propagation.1617 The concept of specific (radiative) intensity of a source at the point  presumes that the destination detector at the point  has optical devices (telescopic lenses and so forth) that can resolve the details of the source area . Then the specific radiative intensity of the source is independent of the distance from source to detector; it is a property of the source alone. This is because it is defined per unit solid angle, the definition of which refers to the area  of the detecting surface.
This may be understood by looking at the diagram. The factor  has the effect of converting the effective emitting area  into a virtual projected area  r2 dΩ2}} at right angles to the vector 
 
 
 
  from source to detector. The solid angle  also has the effect of converting the detecting area  into a virtual projected area  r2 dΩ1}} at right angles to the vector 
 
 
 
  , so that  cos θ2 dA2 / r2}} . Substituting this for  in the above expression for the collected energy 
 
 
 
 , one finds  I (x, t ; r1, ν) cos θ1 dA1 cos θ2 dA2 dν dt / r2}} : when the emitting and detecting areas and angles  and ,  and , are held constant, the collected energy 
 
 
 
  is inversely proportional to the square of the distance 
 
 
 
  between them, with invariant  .
This may be expressed also by the statement that  is invariant with respect to the length 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  ; that is to say, provided the optical devices have adequate resolution, and that the transmitting medium is perfectly transparent, as for example a vacuum, then the specific intensity of the source is unaffected by the length 
 
 
 
  of the ray 
 
 
 
  .181920
For the propagation of light in a transparent medium with a non-unit non-uniform refractive index, the invariant quantity along a ray is the specific intensity divided by the square of the absolute refractive index.21
Reciprocity
For the propagation of light in a semi-transparent medium, specific intensity is not invariant along a ray, because of absorption and emission. Nevertheless, the Stokes-Helmholtz reversion-reciprocity principle applies, because absorption and emission are the same for both senses of a given direction at a point in a stationary medium.
Étendue and reciprocity
The term étendue is used to focus attention specifically on the geometrical aspects. The reciprocal character of étendue is indicated in the article about it. Étendue is defined as a second differential. In the notation of the present article, the second differential of the étendue,  , of the pencil of light which "connects" the two surface elements  and  is defined as

 dA1 cos θ1 dΩ1 {{=}}}}

 dA2 cos θ2 dΩ2}}.
 

This can help understand the geometrical aspects of the Stokes-Helmholtz reversion-reciprocity principle.
Collimated beam
For the present purposes, the light from a star can be treated as a practically collimated beam, but apart from this, a collimated beam is rarely if ever found in nature, though artificially produced beams can be very nearly collimated. For some purposes the rays of the sun can be considered as practically collimated, because the sun subtends an angle of only 32′ of arc.22 The specific (radiative) intensity is suitable for the description of an uncollimated radiative field. The integrals of specific (radiative) intensity with respect to solid angle, used for the definition of spectral flux density, are singular for exactly collimated beams, or may be viewed as Dirac delta functions. Therefore the specific (radiative) intensity is unsuitable for the description of a collimated beam, while spectral flux density is suitable for that purpose.23
Rays
Specific (radiative) intensity is built on the idea of a pencil of rays of light.242526
In an optically isotropic medium, the rays are normals to the wavefronts, but in an optically anisotropic crystalline medium, they are in general at angles to those normals. That is to say, in an optically anisotropic crystal, the energy does not in general propagate at right angles to the wavefronts.2728
Alternative approaches
The specific (radiative) intensity is a radiometric concept. Related to it is the intensity in terms of the photon distribution function,2930 which uses the metaphor31 of a particle of light that traces the path of a ray.
The idea common to the photon and the radiometric concepts is that the energy travels along rays.
Another way to describe the radiative field is in terms of the Maxwell electromagnetic field, which includes the concept of the wavefront. The rays of the radiometric and photon concepts are along the time-averaged Poynting vector of the Maxwell field.32 In an anisotropic medium, the rays are not in general perpendicular to the wavefront.3334
