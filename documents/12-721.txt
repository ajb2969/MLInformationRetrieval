   Monogenic semigroup      Monogenic semigroup   In mathematics , a monogenic semigroup is a semigroup generated by a set containing only a single element. 1 Monogenic semigroups are also called cyclic semigroups . 2  Structure  The monogenic semigroup generated by the singleton set { a } is denoted by    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   . The set of elements of    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   is { a , a 2 , a 3 , ... }. There are two possibilities for the monogenic semigroup    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   :   a m = a n ⇒ m = n .  There exist m ≠ n such that a m = a n .   In the former case    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   is isomorphic to the semigroup ( {1, 2, ... }, + ) of natural numbers under addition . In such a case,    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   is an infinite monogenic semigroup and the element a is said to have infinite order . It is sometimes called the free monogenic semigroup because it is also a free semigroup with one generator.  In the latter case let m be the smallest positive integer such that a m = a  x for some positive integer x ≠ m , and let r be smallest positive integer such that a m = a m + r . The positive integer m is referred to as the index and the positive integer r as the period of the monogenic semigroup    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   . The order of a is defined as m + r -1. The period and the index satisfy the following properties:   a m = a m + r  a m + x = a m + y if and only if m + x ≡ m + y ( mod r )      ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   = { a , a 2 , ... , a m + r − 1 }  K a = { a m , a m + 1 , ... , a m + r − 1 } is a cyclic  subgroup and also an ideal of    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   . It is called the kernel of a and it is the minimal ideal of the monogenic semigroup    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   . 3 4   The pair ( m , r ) of positive integers determine the structure of monogenic semigroups. For every pair ( m , r ) of positive integers, there does exist a monogenic semigroup having index m and period r . The monogenic semigroup having index m and period r is denoted by M ( m , r ). The monogenic semigroup M ( 1, r ) is the cyclic group of order r .  The results in this section actually hold for any element a of an arbitrary semigroup and the monogenic subsemigroup    ⟨  a  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  a    \langle a\rangle   it generates.  Related notions  A related notion is that of periodic semigroup (also called torsion semigroup ), in which every element has finite order (or, equivalently, in which every mongenic subsemigroup is finite). A more general class is that of quasi-periodic semigroups (aka group-bound semigroups or epigroups ) in which every element of the semigroup has a power that lies in a subgroup. 5 6  An aperiodic semigroup is one in which every monogenic subsemigroup has a period of 1.
