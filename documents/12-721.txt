Monogenic semigroup

In mathematics, a monogenic semigroup is a semigroup generated by a set containing only a single element.1 Monogenic semigroups are also called cyclic semigroups.2
Structure
The monogenic semigroup generated by the singleton set { a } is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . The set of elements of 
 
 
 
  is { a, a2, a3, ... }. There are two possibilities for the monogenic semigroup 
 
 
 
 :

am = an ⇒ m = n.
There exist m ≠ n such that am = an.

In the former case 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to the semigroup ( {1, 2, ... }, + ) of natural numbers under addition. In such a case, 
 
 
 
  is an infinite monogenic semigroup and the element a is said to have infinite order. It is sometimes called the free monogenic semigroup because it is also a free semigroup with one generator.
In the latter case let m be the smallest positive integer such that am = a x for some positive integer x ≠ m, and let r be smallest positive integer such that am = am + r. The positive integer m is referred to as the index and the positive integer r as the period of the monogenic semigroup 
 
 
 
 . The order of a is defined as m+r-1. The period and the index satisfy the following properties:

am = am + r
am + x = am + y if and only if m + x ≡ m + y ( mod r )


 
  = { a, a2, ... , am + r − 1 }
Ka = { am, am + 1, ... , am + r − 1 } is a cyclic subgroup and also an ideal of 
 
 
 
 . It is called the kernel of a and it is the minimal ideal of the monogenic semigroup 
 
 
 
 .34

The pair ( m, r ) of positive integers determine the structure of monogenic semigroups. For every pair ( m, r ) of positive integers, there does exist a monogenic semigroup having index m and period r. The monogenic semigroup having index m and period r is denoted by M ( m, r ). The monogenic semigroup M ( 1, r ) is the cyclic group of order r.
The results in this section actually hold for any element a of an arbitrary semigroup and the monogenic subsemigroup 
 
 
 
  it generates.
Related notions
A related notion is that of periodic semigroup (also called torsion semigroup), in which every element has finite order (or, equivalently, in which every mongenic subsemigroup is finite). A more general class is that of quasi-periodic semigroups (aka group-bound semigroups or epigroups) in which every element of the semigroup has a power that lies in a subgroup.56
An aperiodic semigroup is one in which every monogenic subsemigroup has a period of 1.
