Zyablov bound

In coding theory, the Zyablov bound is a lower bound on the rate 
 
 
 
  and relative distance 
 
 
 
  of concatenated codes.
Statement of the bound

Let 
 
 
 
  be the rate of the outer code 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the relative distance, then the rate of the concatenated codes satisfies the following bound.



where 
 
 
 
  is the rate of the inner code 
 
 
 
 .
Description
Let 
 
 
 
  be the outer code, 
 
 
 
  be the inner code.
Consider 
 
 
 
  meets the Singleton bound with rate of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. 
 
 
 
  has relative distance 
 
 
 
  > 
 
 
 
 . In order for 
 
 
 
  to be an asymptotically good code, 
 
 
 
  also needs to be an asymptotically good code which means, 
 
 
 
  needs to have rate 
 
 
 
  > 
 
 
 
  and relative distance 
 
 
 
  > 
 
 
 
 .
Suppose 
 
 
 
  meets the Gilbert-Varshamov bound with rate of 
 
 
 
  and thus with relative distance 
 
 
 
  > 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  has rate of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Expressing 
 
 
 
  as a function of 
 
 
 
 ,
 
 

Then optimizing over the choice of r, we get that rate of the Concatenated error correction code satisﬁes,



This lower bound is called Zyablov bound (the bound of 
 
 
 
  {1 - H_q}(\delta + \varepsilon) is necessary to ensure that 
 
 
 
  > 
 
 
 
 ). See Figure 2 for a plot of this bound.
Note that the Zyablov bound implies that for every 
 
 
 
  > 
 
 
 
 , there exists a (concatenated) code with rate 
 
 
 
  > 
 
 
 
 .
Remarks
We can construct a code that achieves the Zyablov bound in polynomial time. In particular, we can construct explicit asymptotically good code (over some alphabets) in polynomial time.
Linear Codes will help us complete the proof of the above statement since linear codes have polynomial representation. Let Cout be an 
 
 
Reed-Solomon error correction code where 
 
 
 
 (evaluation points being 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 .
We need to construct the Inner code that lies on Gilbert-Varshamov bound. This can be done in two ways

To perform an exhaustive search on all generator matrices until the required property is satisfied for 
 
 
 
 . This is because Varshamovs bound states that there exists a linear code that lies on Gilbert-Varshamon bound which will take 
 
 
 
  time.Using 
 
 
 
  we get 
 
 
 
 , which is upper bounded by 
 
 
 
 , a quasi-polynomial time bound.


To construct 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  time and use 
 
 
 
  time overall. This can be achieved by using the method of conditional expectation on the proof that random linear code lies on the bound with high probability.

Thus we can construct a code that achieves the Zyablov bound in polynomial time.
