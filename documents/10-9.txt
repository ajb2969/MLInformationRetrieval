   Golomb–Dickman constant      Golomb–Dickman constant   In mathematics , the Golomb–Dickman constant arises in the theory of random permutations and in number theory . Its value is       λ  =   0.62432998854355087099293638310083724  …    .      λ    0.62432998854355087099293638310083724  normal-…     \lambda=0.62432998854355087099293638310083724\dots.     Let a n be the average — taken over all permutations of a set of size n — of the length of the longest cycle in each permutation. Then the Golomb–Dickman constant is       λ  =    lim   n  →  ∞      a  n   n     .      λ    subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  a  n   n      \lambda=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{n}.     In the language of probability theory ,    λ  n      λ  n    \lambda n   is asymptotically the expected length of the longest cycle in a uniformly distributed  random permutation of a set of size n .  In number theory, the Golomb–Dickman constant appears in connection with the average size of the largest prime factor of an integer. More precisely,       λ  =    lim   n  →  ∞      1  n     ∑   k  =  2   n     log   (    P  1    (  k  )    )     log   (  k  )         ,      λ    subscript    normal-→  n         1  n     superscript   subscript     k  2    n          subscript  P  1   k      k         \lambda=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}\sum_{k=2}^{n}\frac{\log(P_{1}(k))}{\log(k%
 )},   where     P  1    (  k  )        subscript  P  1   k    P_{1}(k)   is the largest prime factor of k . So if k is a d digit integer, then    λ  d      λ  d    \lambda d   is the asymptotic average number of digits of the largest prime factor of k .  The Golomb–Dickman constant appears in number theory in a different way. What is the probability that second largest prime factor of n is smaller than the square root of the largest prime factor of n ? Asymptotically, this probability is   λ   λ   \lambda   . More precisely,      λ  =   lim   n  →  ∞    Prob   {   P  2    (  n  )   ≤     P  1    (  n  )     }      fragments  λ    subscript    normal-→  n     Prob   fragments  normal-{   subscript  P  2    fragments  normal-(  n  normal-)         subscript  P  1   n    normal-}     \lambda=\lim_{n\to\infty}\text{Prob}\left\{P_{2}(n)\leq\sqrt{P_{1}(n)}\right\}   where     P  2    (  n  )        subscript  P  2   n    P_{2}(n)   is the second largest prime factor n .  There are several expressions for   λ   λ   \lambda   . Namely,      λ  =    ∫  0  ∞     e    -  t   -    E  1    (  t  )      d  t        λ    superscript   subscript   0        superscript  e      t      subscript  E  1   t     d  t      \lambda=\int_{0}^{\infty}e^{-t-E_{1}(t)}dt   where     E  1    (  t  )        subscript  E  1   t    E_{1}(t)   is the exponential integral ,      λ  =    ∫  0  ∞      ρ   (  t  )     t  +  2    d  t        λ    superscript   subscript   0           ρ  t     t  2    d  t      \lambda=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\rho(t)}{t+2}dt   and      λ  =    ∫  0  ∞      ρ   (  t  )      (   t  +  1   )   2    d  t        λ    superscript   subscript   0           ρ  t    superscript    t  1   2    d  t      \lambda=\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{\rho(t)}{(t+1)^{2}}dt   where    ρ   (  t  )       ρ  t    \rho(t)   is the Dickman function .
