TWIP steel

Twinning-Induced Plasticity steel which is also known as TWIP steel is a class of austenitic steels which can deform by both glide of individual dislocations and mechanical twinning on the {1 1 1}γ\bar{2}>γ system.1
History
First steel based on plasticity induced by mechanical twinning was found in 1998 which had strength of 800 MPa with a total elongation of above 85%.2 These values vary with deformation temperature, strain rate and chemical composition.34
Researchers have shown that increased work hardening attributed to the partitioning of the austenite grains is the main contributing factor to the overall elongation of TWIP steels in which the mechanical strain of twinning have a rather small contribution.5
Compositions
TWIP steels usually contain large concentrations of Mn because it is crucial to preserve the austenitic structure based on the ternary system of Fe-Mn-Al 6 and control Stacking Fault Energy (SFE) of the Iron based alloys.78
The addition of aluminium to Fe-high Mn TWIP steels is because it increases SFE significantly and therefore stabilizes the austenite against phase transformations which can occurs in the Fe-Mn alloys during deformation.9 Furthermore, it strengthens the austenite by solid-solution hardening.10
Properties
  Austenitic steels are used widely in many applications because of their excellent strength and ductility combined with good wear and corrosion resistance. High-Mn TWIP steels are attractive for automotive applications due to their high energy absorption, which is more than twice that of conventional high strength steels,11 and high stiffness which can improve the crash safety.12
