   Multiplier algebra      Multiplier algebra   In C*-algebras , the multiplier algebra , denoted by M ( A ), of a C*-algebra A is a unital C*-algebra which is the largest unital C*-algebra that contains A as an ideal in a "non-degenerate" way. It is the noncommutative generalization of Stone–Čech compactification . Multiplier algebras were introduced by .  For example, if A is the C*-algebra of compact operators on a separable Hilbert space , M ( A ) is B ( H ), the C*-algebra of all bounded operators on H .  Definition  An ideal I in a C*-algebra B is said to be essential if I ∩ J is non-trivial for all ideal J . An ideal I is essential if and only if I ⊥ , the "orthogonal complement" of I in the Hilbert C*-module  B is {0}.  Let A be a C*-algebra. Its multiplier algebra M ( A ) is the C*-algebra satisfying the following universal property : for all C*-algebra D containing A as an ideal, there exists a unique *-homomorphism φ D → M ( A ) such that φ extends the identity homomorphism on A and φ ( A ⊥ ) = {0}.  Uniqueness up to isomorphism is specified by the universal property. When A is unital, M ( A ) = A . It also follows from the definition that for any D containing A as an essential ideal, the multiplier algebra M ( A ) contains D as a C*-subalgebra.  The existence of M ( A ) can be shown in several ways.  A double centralizer of a C*-algebra A is a pair ( L , R ) of bounded linear maps on A such that aL ( b ) = R ( a ) b for all a and b in A . This implies that || L || = || R ||. The set of double centralizers of A can be given a C*-algebra structure. This C*-algebra contains A as an essential ideal and can be identified as the multiplier algebra M ( A ). For instance, if A is the compact operators K ( H ) on a separable Hilbert space, then each x ∈ B ( H ) defines a double centralizer of A by simply multiplication from the left and right.  Alternatively, M ( A ) can be obtained via representations. The following fact will be needed:  Lemma. If I is an ideal in a C*-algebra B , then any faithful nondegenerate representation π of I can be extended uniquely to B .  Now take any faithful nondegenerate representation π of A on a Hilbert space H . The above lemma, together with the universal property of the multiplier algebra, yields that M ( A ) is isomorphic to the idealizer of π ( A ) in B ( H ). It is immediate that M ( K ( H )) = B ( H ).  Lastly, let E be a Hilbert C*-module and B ( E ) (resp. K ( E )) be the adjointable (resp. compact) operators on E  M ( A ) can be identified via a *-homomorphism of A into B ( E ). Something similar to the above lemma is true:  Lemma. If I is an ideal in a C*-algebra B , then any faithful nondegenerate *-homomorphism π of I into B ( E )can be extended uniquely to B .  Consequently, if π is a faithful nondegenerate *-homomorphism of π into B ( E ), then M ( A ) is isomorphic to the idealizer of π ( A ). For instance, M ( K ( E )) = B ( E ) for any Hilbert module E .  The C*-algebra A is isomorphic to the compact operators on the Hilbert module A . Therefore M ( A ) is the adjointable operators on A .  Strict topology  Consider the topology on M ( A ) specified by the seminorms { l a , r a } a ∈ A , where          l  a    (  x  )    =   ∥   a  x   ∥    ,     r  a    (  x  )    =   ∥   x  a   ∥     .     formulae-sequence       subscript  l  a   x    norm    a  x          subscript  r  a   x    norm    x  a       l_{a}(x)=\|ax\|,\;r_{a}(x)=\|xa\|.     The resulting topology is called the strict topology on M ( A ). A is strictly dense in M ( A ) .  When A is unital, M ( A ) = A , and the strict topology coincides with the norm topology. For B ( H ) = M ( K ( H )), the strict topology is the σ-strong* topology . It follows from above that B ( H ) is complete in the σ-strong* topology.  Commutative case  Let X be a locally compact  Hausdorff space , A = C 0 ( X ), the commutative C*-algebra of continuous functions with compact support on X . Then M ( A ) is C b ( X ), the continuous bounded functions on X . By the Gelfand-Naimark theorem , one has the isomorphism of C*-algebras        C  b    (  X  )    ≃   C   (  Y  )       similar-to-or-equals     subscript  C  b   X     C  Y     C_{b}(X)\simeq C(Y)     where Y is the spectrum of C b ( X ). Y is in fact homeomorphic to the Stone–Čech compactification of X .  Corona algebra  The corona or corona algebra of A is the quotient M ( A )/ A . For example, the corona algebra of the algebra of compact operators on a Hilbert space is the Calkin algebra .  The corona algebra is a non-commutative analogue of the corona set of a topological space.  References   B. Blackadar, K-Theory for Operator Algebras , MSRI Publications, 1986.     "  *
