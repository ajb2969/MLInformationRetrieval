   Symmetric function      Symmetric function   In mathematics , a symmetric function of n variables is one whose value at any n - tuple of arguments is the same as its value at any permutation of that n -tuple. While this notion can apply to any type of function whose n arguments have the same domain set, it is most often used for polynomial functions , in which case these are the functions given by symmetric polynomials . There is very little systematic theory of symmetric non-polynomial functions of n variables, so this sense is little-used, except as a general definition.  Symmetrization  Given any function f in n variables with values in an abelian group, a symmetric function can be constructed by summing values of f over all permutations of the arguments. Similarly, an anti-symmetric function can be constructed by summing over even permutations and subtracting the sum over odd permutations . These operations are of course not invertible, and could well result in a function that is identically zero for nontrivial functions f . The only general case where f can be recovered if both its symmetrization and anti-symmetrization are known is when n = 2 and the abelian group admits a division by 2 (inverse of doubling); then f is equal to half the sum of its symmetrization and its anti-symmetrization.  Examples   Consider the real function          f   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3   )    =    (   x  -   x  1    )    (   x  -   x  2    )    (   x  -   x  3    )          f    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3         x   subscript  x  1      x   subscript  x  2      x   subscript  x  3       f(x_{1},x_{2},x_{3})=(x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})(x-x_{3})         By definition, a symmetric function with n variables has the property that      f   (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =   f   (   x  2   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    =   f   (   x  3   ,   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  n   ,   x   n  -  1    )            f    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n       f    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n            f    subscript  x  3    subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  n    subscript  x    n  1         f(x_{1},x_{2},...,x_{n})=f(x_{2},x_{1},...,x_{n})=f(x_{3},x_{1},...,x_{n},x_{n%
 -1})   etc.     In general, the function remains the same for every permutation of its variables. This means that, in this case,       (   x  -   x  1    )    (   x  -   x  2    )    (   x  -   x  3    )    =    (   x  -   x  2    )    (   x  -   x  1    )    (   x  -   x  3    )    =    (   x  -   x  3    )    (   x  -   x  1    )    (   x  -   x  2    )              x   subscript  x  1      x   subscript  x  2      x   subscript  x  3         x   subscript  x  2      x   subscript  x  1      x   subscript  x  3              x   subscript  x  3      x   subscript  x  1      x   subscript  x  2        (x-x_{1})(x-x_{2})(x-x_{3})=(x-x_{2})(x-x_{1})(x-x_{3})=(x-x_{3})(x-x_{1})(x-x%
 _{2})      and so on, for all permutations of     x  1   ,   x  2   ,   x  3       subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2    subscript  x  3     x_{1},x_{2},x_{3}       Consider the function          f   (  x  ,  y  )    =     x  2   +   y  2    -   r  2          f   x  y         superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2     superscript  r  2      f(x,y)=x^{2}+y^{2}-r^{2}         If x and y are interchanged the function becomes      f   (  y  ,  x  )    =     y  2   +   x  2    -   r  2          f   y  x         superscript  y  2    superscript  x  2     superscript  r  2      f(y,x)=y^{2}+x^{2}-r^{2}      which yields exactly the same results as the original f ( x , y ).    Consider now the function          f   (  x  ,  y  )    =     a   x  2    +   b   y  2     -   r  2          f   x  y          a   superscript  x  2      b   superscript  y  2      superscript  r  2      f(x,y)=ax^{2}+by^{2}-r^{2}         If x and y are interchanged, the function becomes       f   (  y  ,  x  )    =     a   y  2    +   b   x  2     -   r  2     .        f   y  x          a   superscript  y  2      b   superscript  x  2      superscript  r  2      f(y,x)=ay^{2}+bx^{2}-r^{2}.      This function is obviously not the same as the original if , which makes it non-symmetric.   Applications  U-statistics  In statistics , an n -sample statistic (a function in n variables) that is obtained by bootstrapping symmetrization of a k -sample statistic, yielding a symmetric function in n variables, is called a U-statistic .
