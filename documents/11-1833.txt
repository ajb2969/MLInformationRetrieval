   Schur–Weyl duality      Schur–Weyl duality   Schur–Weyl duality is a mathematical theorem in representation theory that relates irreducible finite-dimensional representations of the general linear and symmetric groups. It is named after two pioneers of representation theory of Lie groups , Issai Schur , who discovered the phenomenon, and Hermann Weyl , who popularized it in his books on quantum mechanics and classical groups as a way of classifying representations of unitary and general linear groups.  Description  Schur–Weyl duality forms an archetypical situation in representation theory involving two kinds of symmetry that determine each other. Consider the tensor space       ℂ  n   ⊗   ℂ  n   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   ℂ  n      tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  n   normal-⋯   superscript  ℂ  n     \mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}   with k factors.  The symmetric group  S k on k letters acts on this space (on the left) by permuting the factors,        σ   (    v  1   ⊗   v  2   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   v  k    )    =    v    σ   -  1     (  1  )     ⊗   v    σ   -  1     (  2  )     ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   v    σ   -  1     (  k  )       .        σ   tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-⋯   subscript  v  k      tensor-product   subscript  v     superscript  σ    1    1     subscript  v     superscript  σ    1    2    normal-⋯   subscript  v     superscript  σ    1    k       \sigma(v_{1}\otimes v_{2}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{k})=v_{\sigma^{-1}(1)}\otimes
 v%
 _{\sigma^{-1}(2)}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{\sigma^{-1}(k)}.     The general linear group GL n of invertible n × n matrices acts on it by the simultaneous matrix multiplication ,         g   (    v  1   ⊗   v  2   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   v  k    )    =       g   v  1    ⊗  g    v  2    ⊗  ⋯  ⊗  g    v  k     ,   g  ∈   G   L  n      .     formulae-sequence      g   tensor-product   subscript  v  1    subscript  v  2   normal-⋯   subscript  v  k        tensor-product     tensor-product    g   subscript  v  1    g    subscript  v  2    normal-⋯  g    subscript  v  k       g    G   subscript  L  n       g(v_{1}\otimes v_{2}\otimes\cdots\otimes v_{k})=gv_{1}\otimes gv_{2}\otimes%
 \cdots\otimes gv_{k},\quad g\in GL_{n}.     These two actions commute , and in its concrete form, the Schur–Weyl duality asserts that under the joint action of the groups S k and GL n , the tensor space decomposes into a direct sum of tensor products of irreducible modules for these two groups that determine each other,         ℂ  n   ⊗   ℂ  n   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   ℂ  n    =    ∑  D     π  k  D   ⊗   ρ  n  D      .       tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  n   normal-⋯   superscript  ℂ  n      subscript   D    tensor-product   superscript   subscript  π  k   D    superscript   subscript  ρ  n   D       \mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\cdots\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}=\sum_{D}%
 \pi_{k}^{D}\otimes\rho_{n}^{D}.     The summands are indexed by the Young diagrams  D with k boxes and at most n rows, and representations    π  k  D     superscript   subscript  π  k   D    \pi_{k}^{D}   of S k with different D are mutually non-isomorphic, and the same is true for representations    ρ  n  D     superscript   subscript  ρ  n   D    \rho_{n}^{D}   of GL n .  The abstract form of the Schur–Weyl duality asserts that two algebras of operators on the tensor space generated by the actions of GL n and S k are the full mutual centralizers in the algebra of the endomorphisms      End  ℂ    (    ℂ  n   ⊗   ℂ  n   ⊗  ⋯  ⊗   ℂ  n    )    .       subscript  End  ℂ    tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  n   normal-⋯   superscript  ℂ  n      \mathrm{End}_{\mathbb{C}}(\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\cdots%
 \otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}).     Example  Suppose that k = 2 and n is greater than one. Then the Schur–Weyl duality is the statement that the space of two-tensors decomposes into symmetric and antisymmetric parts, each of which is an irreducible module for GL n :         ℂ  n   ⊗   ℂ  n    =     S  2    ℂ  n    ⊕    Λ  2    ℂ  n      .       tensor-product   superscript  ℂ  n    superscript  ℂ  n     direct-sum     superscript  S  2    superscript  ℂ  n       superscript  normal-Λ  2    superscript  ℂ  n       \mathbb{C}^{n}\otimes\mathbb{C}^{n}=S^{2}\mathbb{C}^{n}\oplus\Lambda^{2}%
 \mathbb{C}^{n}.     The symmetric group S 2 consists of two elements and has two irreducible representations, the trivial representation and the sign representation . The trivial representation of S 2 gives rise to the symmetric tensors, which are invariant (i.e. do not change) under the permutation of the factors, and the sign representation corresponds to the skew-symmetric tensors, which flip the sign.
