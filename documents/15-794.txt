D-arabinitol dehydrogenase (NADP+)

 D-arabinitol dehydrogenase (NADP+) (, NADP+-dependent D-arabitol dehydrogenase, ARD1p, D-arabitol dehydrogenase 1) is an enzyme with system name D-arabinitol:NADP+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) D-arabinitol + NADP+

 
  D-xylulose + NADPH + H+

(2) D-arabinitol + NADP+

 
  D-ribulose + NADPH + H+


The enzyme present in the fungus Uromyces fabae can make use D-arabinitol and D-mannitol in the forward direction, and D-xylulose, D-ribulose and D-fructose in the reverse direction.
