Alpha-1,3-glucan synthase




Alpha-1,3-glucan synthase

In enzymology, an alpha-1,3-glucan synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + [alpha-D-glucosyl-(1-3)]n 
 
 
 
  UDP + [alpha-D-glucosyl-(1-3)]n+1
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and [[[alpha-D-glucosyl-(1-3)]n]], whereas its two products are UDP and [[[alpha-D-glucosyl-(1-3)]n+1]].
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:alpha-D-(1-3)-glucan 3-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-1,3-alpha-glucan glucosyltransferase, and 1,3-alpha-D-glucan synthase.
