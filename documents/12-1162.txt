Clearing factor

In centrifugation the clearing factor or k factor represents the relative pelleting efficiency of a given centrifuge rotor at maximum rotation speed. It can be used to estimate the time 
 
 
 
  (in hours) required for sedimentation of a fraction with a known sedimentation coefficient

 
  (in svedbergs):



The value of the clearing factor depends on the maximum angular velocity

 
  of a centrifuge (in rad/s) and the minimum and maximum radius

 
  of the rotor:



As the rotational speed of a centrifuge is usually specified in RPM, the following formula is often used for convenience:1



Centrifuge manufacturers usually specify the minimum, maximum and average radius of a rotor, as well as the 
 
 
 
 
  factor of a centrifuge-rotor combination.
For runs with a rotational speed lower than the maximum rotor-speed, the 
 
 
 
  factor has to be adjusted:

The K-factor is related to the sedimentation coefficient 
 
 
 
  by the formula:



Where 
 
 
 
 
  is the time to pellet a certain particle in hours. Since 
 
 
 
  is a constant for a certain particle, this relationship can be used to interconvert between different rotors.



Where 
 
 
 
  is the time to pellet in one rotor, and 
 
 
 
  is the K-factor of that rotor. 
 
 
 
 
  is the K-factor of the other rotor, and 
 
 
 
 , the time to pellet in the other rotor, can be calculated. In this manner, one does not need access to the exact rotor cited in a protocol, as long as the K-factor can be calculated. Many online calculators are available to perform the calculations for common rotors.
