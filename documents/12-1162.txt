   Clearing factor      Clearing factor   In centrifugation the clearing factor or k factor represents the relative pelleting efficiency of a given centrifuge rotor at maximum rotation speed. It can be used to estimate the time   t   t   t   (in hours) required for sedimentation of a fraction with a known sedimentation coefficient    s   s   s   (in svedbergs ):      t  =   k  s       t    k  s     t=\frac{k}{s}     The value of the clearing factor depends on the maximum angular velocity    ω   ω   \omega   of a centrifuge (in rad/s) and the minimum and maximum radius    r   r   r   of the rotor :      k  =     ln   (    r  max   /   r  min    )     ω  2    ×    10   -  13    3600        k           subscript  r  max    subscript  r  min      superscript  ω  2       superscript  10    13    3600      k=\frac{\ln(r_{\rm{max}}/r_{\rm{min}})}{\omega^{2}}\times\frac{10^{-13}}{3600}     As the rotational speed of a centrifuge is usually specified in RPM , the following formula is often used for convenience: 1      k  =     2.53  ⋅   10  5    ×   ln   (    r  max   /   r  min    )       (   RPM  /  1000   )   2        k       normal-⋅  2.53   superscript  10  5         subscript  r  max    subscript  r  min       superscript    RPM  1000   2      k=\frac{2.53\cdot 10^{5}\times\ln(r_{\rm{max}}/r_{\rm{min}})}{(\rm{RPM}/1000)^%
 {2}}     Centrifuge manufacturers usually specify the minimum, maximum and average radius of a rotor, as well as the   k   k   k   factor of a centrifuge-rotor combination.  For runs with a rotational speed lower than the maximum rotor-speed, the   k   k   k   factor has to be adjusted:       k  adj   =   k   (   maximum rotor-speed  actual rotor-speed   )         subscript  k  adj     k    maximum rotor-speed  actual rotor-speed      k_{\rm{adj}}=k\left(\frac{\mbox{maximum rotor-speed}}{\mbox{actual rotor-speed%
 }}\right)    2  The K-factor is related to the sedimentation coefficient   S   S   S   by the formula:      T  =   K  S       T    K  S     T=\frac{K}{S}     Where   T   T   T   is the time to pellet a certain particle in hours. Since   S   S   S   is a constant for a certain particle, this relationship can be used to interconvert between different rotors.        T  1    K  1    =    T  2    K  2           subscript  T  1    subscript  K  1       subscript  T  2    subscript  K  2      \frac{T_{1}}{K_{1}}=\frac{T_{2}}{K_{2}}     Where    T  1     subscript  T  1    T_{1}   is the time to pellet in one rotor, and    K  1     subscript  K  1    K_{1}   is the K-factor of that rotor.    K  2     subscript  K  2    K_{2}   is the K-factor of the other rotor, and    T  2     subscript  T  2    T_{2}   , the time to pellet in the other rotor, can be calculated. In this manner, one does not need access to the exact rotor cited in a protocol, as long as the K-factor can be calculated. Many online calculators are available to perform the calculations for common rotors.
