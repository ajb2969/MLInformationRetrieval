   Divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes      Divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes   The sum of the reciprocals of all prime numbers  diverges ; that is:        ∑   p  prime     1  p    =    1  2   +   1  3   +   1  5   +   1  7   +   1  11   +   1  13   +   1  17   +  ⋯   =  ∞          subscript     p  prime      1  p        1  2     1  3     1  5     1  7     1  11     1  13     1  17   normal-⋯            \sum_{p\text{ prime }}\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}%
 {7}+\frac{1}{11}+\frac{1}{13}+\frac{1}{17}+\cdots=\infty     This was proved by Leonhard Euler in 1737, and strengthens Euclid 's 3rd-century-BC result that there are infinitely many prime numbers .  There are a variety of proofs of Euler's result, including a lower bound for the partial sums stating that        ∑       p  prime        p  ≤  n         1  p    ≥    log   log   (   n  +  1   )     -   log    π  2   6           subscript    STACKED    p  prime     p  n       1  p            n  1          superscript  π  2   6       \sum_{\scriptstyle p\text{ prime }\atop\scriptstyle p\leq n}\frac{1}{p}\geq%
 \log\log(n+1)-\log\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}     for all natural numbers n . The double natural logarithm indicates that the divergence might be very slow, which is indeed the case, see Meissel–Mertens constant .  The harmonic series  First, we describe how Euler originally discovered the result. He was considering the harmonic series        ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1  n    =   1  +   1  2   +   1  3   +   1  4   +  ⋯         superscript   subscript     n  1        1  n      1    1  2     1  3     1  4   normal-⋯     \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}=1+\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4}+\cdots     He had already used the following " product formula " to show the existence of infinitely many primes.        ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1  n    =    ∏  p    1   1  -   p   -  1       =    ∏  p    (   1  +   1  p   +   1   p  2    +  ⋯   )            superscript   subscript     n  1        1  n      subscript  product  p     1    1   superscript  p    1              subscript  product  p     1    1  p     1   superscript  p  2    normal-⋯       \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}=\prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}=\prod_{p}\left(1+%
 \frac{1}{p}+\frac{1}{p^{2}}+\cdots\right)     (Here, the product is taken over all primes p ; in the following, a sum or product taken over p always represents a sum or product taken over a specified set of primes, unless noted otherwise.)  Such infinite products are today called Euler products . The product above is a reflection of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic . Of course, the above "equation" is not necessary because the harmonic series is known (by other means) to diverge.  Euler noted that if there were only a finite number of primes, then the product on the right would clearly converge, contradicting the divergence of the harmonic series. (In modern language, we now say that the existence of infinitely many primes is reflected by the fact that the Riemann zeta function has a simple pole at s = 1.)  Proofs  First  Euler took the above product formula and proceeded to make a sequence of audacious leaps of logic. First, he took the natural logarithm of each side, then he used the Taylor series expansion for ln( x ) as well as the sum of a geometric series:      ln   (     ∑   n  =  1   ∞      1  n     )         superscript   subscript     n  1        1  n      \displaystyle\ln\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\right)     for a fixed constant C \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} + \frac{1}{7} + \frac{1}{11} + \cdots = \ln \ln (+ \infty)  It is almost certain that Euler meant that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes less than n is asymptotic to ln(ln( n )) as n approaches infinity. It turns out this is indeed the case; Euler had reached a correct result by questionable means.  A variation         log    (     ∑   n  =  1   ∞      1  n     )    =   log   (     ∏  p      1   1  -   p   -  1        )    =     ∑  p     log   (    p   p  -  1     )     =     ∑  p     log   (   1  +    1   p  -  1      )      .            superscript   subscript     n  1        1  n         subscript  product  p     1    1   superscript  p    1               subscript   p       p    p  1             subscript   p       1    1    p  1          \displaystyle{}\quad\log\left(\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\right)=\log\left(%
 \prod_{p}\frac{1}{1-p^{-1}}\right)=\sum_{p}\log\left(\frac{p}{p-1}\right)=\sum%
 _{p}\log\left(1+\frac{1}{p-1}\right).     Since the Maclaurin series for    e  x     superscript  e  x    e^{x}   is,       e  x   =   1  +  x  +    ∑   n  =  2   ∞     x  n    n  !           superscript  e  x     1  x    superscript   subscript     n  2         superscript  x  n     n        e^{x}=1+x+\sum_{n=2}^{\infty}\frac{x^{n}}{n!}   dropping the summation shows that      e  x    ≥    1   +  x        superscript  e  x     1  x     e^{x}\,\geq\,1\,+\,x   , and we see     log   (   e  x   )    ≥   log   (    1   +  x   )           superscript  e  x        1  x      \log(e^{x})\,\geq\,\log(1\,+\,x)   , and     x   ≥   log   (    1   +  x   )        x      1  x      x\,\geq\,\log(1\,+\,x)   . So,         ∑  p    1   p  -  1     ≥    ∑  p    log   (   1  +   1   p  -  1     )     =   log   (    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    1  n    )     .          subscript   p     1    p  1       subscript   p       1    1    p  1                superscript   subscript     n  1        1  n        \sum_{p}\frac{1}{p-1}\geq\sum_{p}\log\left(1+\frac{1}{p-1}\right)=\log\left(%
 \sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{n}\right).     Hence     ∑  p    1   p  -  1        subscript   p     1    p  1      \sum_{p}\frac{1}{p-1}   diverges. But, with     p  i   ≥  3       subscript  p  i   3    p_{i}\geq 3   and    p  i     subscript  p  i    p_{i}   is the   i   i   i    th prime,        1   p   i  -  1      ≥   1    p  i   -  1          1   subscript  p    i  1       1     subscript  p  i   1      \frac{1}{p_{i-1}}\,\geq\,\frac{1}{p_{i}-1}   .  Hence     ∑  p    1  p       subscript   p     1  p     \sum_{p}\frac{1}{p}   diverges.  Second  The following proof by contradiction is due to Paul Erdős .  Let p i denote the i th prime number. Assume that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes converges ; i.e.,        ∑   i  =  1   ∞    1   p  i     <  ∞        superscript   subscript     i  1        1   subscript  p  i        \sum_{i=1}^{\infty}{1\over p_{i}}<\infty     Then there exists a smallest positive  integer  k such that        ∑   i  =   k  +  1    ∞    1   p  i     <    1  2    (  1  )          superscript   subscript     i    k  1         1   subscript  p  i        1  2   1     \sum_{i=k+1}^{\infty}{1\over p_{i}}<{1\over 2}\qquad(1)     For a positive integer x let M x denote the set of those n in {1, 2, . . ., x } which are not divisible by any prime greater than p k . We will now derive an upper and a lower estimate for the number | M x | of elements in M x . For large x , these bounds will turn out to be contradictory.  Upper estimate  Every n in M x can be written as n = r m 2 with positive integers m and r , where r is square-free . Since only the k primes p 1 , …, p k can show up (with exponent 1) in the prime factorization of r , there are at most 2 k different possibilities for r . Furthermore, there are at most √ x possible values for m . This gives us the upper estimate       |   M  x   |   ≤     2  k    x     (  2  )           subscript  M  x        superscript  2  k     x    2     |M_{x}|\leq 2^{k}\sqrt{x}\qquad(2)     Lower estimate  The remaining x − | M x | numbers in the set difference {1, 2, . . ., x } \ M x are all divisible by a prime greater than p k . Let N i,x denote the set of those n in {1, 2, . . ., x} which are divisible by the i th prime p i . Then        {  1  ,  2  ,  …  ,  x  }   ∖   M  x    =    ⋃   i  =   k  +  1    ∞    N   i  ,  x            1  2  normal-…  x    subscript  M  x      superscript   subscript     i    k  1        subscript  N   i  x       \{1,2,\ldots,x\}\setminus M_{x}=\bigcup_{i=k+1}^{\infty}N_{i,x}     Since the number of integers in N i,x is at most x / p i (actually zero for p i > x ), we get       x  -   |   M  x   |    ≤    ∑   i  =   k  +  1    ∞    |   N   i  ,  x    |    <    ∑   i  =   k  +  1    ∞    x   p  i             x     subscript  M  x       superscript   subscript     i    k  1          subscript  N   i  x             superscript   subscript     i    k  1         x   subscript  p  i        x-|M_{x}|\leq\sum_{i=k+1}^{\infty}|N_{i,x}|<\sum_{i=k+1}^{\infty}{x\over p_{i}}     Using (1), this implies       x  2   <    |   M  x   |    (  3  )          x  2       subscript  M  x    3     {x\over 2}<|M_{x}|\qquad(3)     Contradiction  When x ≥ 2 2 k + 2 , the estimates (2) and (3) cannot both hold, because     x  2   ≥    2  k    x          x  2      superscript  2  k     x      \tfrac{x}{2}\geq 2^{k}\sqrt{x}   .  Third  Here is another proof that actually gives a lower estimate for the partial sums; in particular, it shows that these sums grow at least as fast as log(log( n )). The proof is an adaptation of the product expansion idea of Euler . In the following, a sum or product taken over p always represents a sum or product taken over a specified set of primes.  The proof rests upon the following four inequalities:   Every positive integer i can be uniquely expressed as the product of a square-free integer and a square. This gives the inequality           ∑   i  =  1   n    1  i    ≤    ∏   p  ≤  n      (   1  +   1  p    )     ∑   k  =  1   n    1   k  2             superscript   subscript     i  1    n     1  i      subscript  product    p  n        1    1  p      superscript   subscript     k  1    n     1   superscript  k  2         \sum_{i=1}^{n}{\frac{1}{i}}\leq\prod_{p\leq n}{\left(1+\frac{1}{p}\right)}\sum%
 _{k=1}^{n}{\frac{1}{k^{2}}}       where for every i between 1 and n the (expanded) product corresponds to the square-free part of i and the sum corresponds to the square part of i (see fundamental theorem of arithmetic ).    The upper estimate for the natural logarithm          \log(n+1)  = \int_1^{n+1}\frac{dx}x  = \sum_{i=1}^n\underbrace{\int_i^{i+1}\frac{dx}x}_{{} \,   The lower estimate 1 + x 0.    Let n ≥ 2. The upper bound (using a telescoping sum ) for the partial sums (convergence is all we really need)          \sum_{k=1}^n{\frac{1}{k^2}}  \, 1/k^2}  = 1 + \frac23 - \frac1{n + \frac{1}{2}}  Combining all these inequalities, we see that      log   (   n  +  1   )         n  1     \displaystyle{}\log(n+1)     Dividing through by    5  3      5  3    \frac{5}{3}   and taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives        log   log   (   n  +  1   )     -   log   5  3     <    ∑   p  ≤  n     1  p                n  1         5  3       subscript     p  n      1  p      \log\log(n+1)-\log\frac{5}{3}<\sum_{p\leq n}{\frac{1}{p}}     as desired. ∎  Using        ∑   k  =  1   ∞    1   k  2     =    π  2   6         superscript   subscript     k  1        1   superscript  k  2        superscript  π  2   6     \sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{\frac{1}{k^{2}}}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{6}     (see Basel problem ), the above constant ln (    5  3      5  3    \frac{5}{3}   ) = 0.51082… can be improved to ln( ) = 0.4977…; in fact it turns out that        lim   n  →  ∞     (     ∑   p  ≤  n     1  p    -   log   log   (  n  )      )    =  M        subscript    normal-→  n         subscript     p  n      1  p        n      M    \lim_{n\to\infty}\left(\sum_{p\leq n}\frac{1}{p}-\log\log(n)\right)=M     where M = 0.261497… is the Meissel–Mertens constant (somewhat analogous to the much more famous Euler–Mascheroni constant ).  Fourth  From Dusart's inequality , we get        p  n   <    n   log  n    +   n   log   log  n         for  n   ≥  6      formulae-sequence     subscript  p  n       n    n      n      n           for  n   6     p_{n}     Then        ∑   n  =  1   ∞      1   p  n         superscript   subscript     n  1        1   subscript  p  n      \displaystyle\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{p_{n}}     by the integral test for convergence . This shows that the series on the left diverges.  Partial sums  While the partial sums of the reciprocals of the primes eventually exceed any integer value, they never equal an integer.  One proof 1 is by induction: The first partial sum is     1  2   ,      1  2    \frac{1}{2},   which has the form     odd  even   =    O  1    E  1          odd  even      subscript  O  1    subscript  E  1      \frac{\text{odd}}{\text{even}}=\frac{O_{1}}{E_{1}}   where O and E refer to odd and even numbers respectively. If the n th partial sum has the form      O  n    E  n    ,       subscript  O  n    subscript  E  n     \frac{O_{n}}{E_{n}},   then the ( n +1) st one equals       O  n    E  n    +   1   p   n  +  1      =      O  n    p   n  +  1     +   E  n      E  n    p   n  +  1      =    O   n  +  1     E   n  +  1                subscript  O  n    subscript  E  n      1   subscript  p    n  1             subscript  O  n    subscript  p    n  1      subscript  E  n       subscript  E  n    subscript  p    n  1              subscript  O    n  1     subscript  E    n  1        \frac{O_{n}}{E_{n}}+\frac{1}{p_{n+1}}=\frac{O_{n}p_{n+1}+E_{n}}{E_{n}p_{n+1}}=%
 \frac{O_{n+1}}{E_{n+1}}   for the ( n +1) st prime     p   n  +  1    ;     subscript  p    n  1     p_{n+1};   since this repeats the odd-over-even form, this partial sum cannot be an integer (because 2 divides the denominator but not the numerator), and the induction continues.  Another proof rewrites the expression for the sum of the first n reciprocals of primes (or indeed the sum of the reciprocals of any set of primes) in terms of the least common denominator , which is the product of all these primes. Then each of these primes divides all but one of the numerator terms and hence does not divide the numerator itself; but each prime does divide the denominator. Thus the expression is irreducible and is non-integer.
