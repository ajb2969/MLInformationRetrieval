 Burton Wold Wind Farm was the first to be erected in Northamptonshire. Construction work on the site began in December 2005, and the wind farm became operational in May 2006. It comprises 10 turbines with a total nameplate capacity of 20 megawatts. These 10 turbines have the ability to produce electricity for an average of 10,000 homes each year, the equivalent of 25% of all the homes in the borough of Kettering. The E70-E4 turbines were supplied by Enercon Gmbh of Germany,2 who are one of the leading manufacturers of wind turbines in the world. Each turbine is 64 meters tall to the hub, the rotor blades have a diameter of 71 meters which gives the turbines an overall height from the ground to the vertical tip of a blade of 99.5 meters.3
