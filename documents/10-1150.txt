   Trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase      Trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a trans-cinnamate 4-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   trans-cinnamate + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-hydroxycinnamate + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are trans-cinnamate , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 4-hydroxycinnamate , NADP + , and H 2 O . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine metabolism and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis . It employs one cofactor , heme .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is trans-cinnamate,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating). Other names in common use include:   cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase,  oxygenase, cinnamate 4-mono-,  CA4H,  cytochrome P450 cinnamate 4-hydroxylase,  cinnamate 4-hydroxylase,  cinnamate 4-monooxygenase,  cinnamate hydroxylase,  cinnamic 4-hydroxylase,  cinnamic acid 4-monooxygenase,  cinnamic acid p-hydroxylase,  hydroxylase, cinnamate 4-,  t-cinnamic acid hydroxylase,  trans-cinnamate 4-hydroxylase, and  trans-cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase.
