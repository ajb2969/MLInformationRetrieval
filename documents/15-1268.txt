   16S rRNA (cytosine1402-N4)-methyltransferase      16S rRNA (cytosine1402-N4)-methyltransferase   16S rRNA (cytosine 1402 -N 4 )-methyltransferase (, RsmH , MraW ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytosine1402-N4)-methyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine 1402 in 16S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 4 -methylcytosine 1402 in 16S rRNA   RsmH catalyses the N 4 -methylation of cytosine 1402 .
