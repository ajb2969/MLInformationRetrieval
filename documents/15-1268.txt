16S rRNA (cytosine1402-N4)-methyltransferase

16S rRNA (cytosine1402-N4)-methyltransferase (, RsmH, MraW) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:16S rRNA (cytosine1402-N4)-methyltransferase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cytosine1402 in 16S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N4-methylcytosine1402 in 16S rRNA
 

RsmH catalyses the N4-methylation of cytosine1402.
