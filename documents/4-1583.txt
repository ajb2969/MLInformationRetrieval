   Sigma additivity      Sigma additivity   In mathematics , additivity and sigma additivity (also called countable additivity ) of a function defined on subsets of a given set are abstractions of the intuitive properties of size ( length , area , volume ) of a set.  Additive (or finitely additive) set functions  Let    μ   μ   \mu    be a function defined on an algebra of sets    𝒜   𝒜   \scriptstyle\mathcal{A}   with values in [−∞, +∞] (see the extended real number line ). The function   μ   μ   \mu   is called additive , or finitely additive , if, whenever A and B are disjoint sets in   𝒜   𝒜   \scriptstyle\mathcal{A}   , one has        μ   (   A  ∪  B   )    =    μ   (  A  )    +   μ   (  B  )      .        μ    A  B        μ  A     μ  B      \mu(A\cup B)=\mu(A)+\mu(B).\,     (A consequence of this is that an additive function cannot take both −∞ and +∞ as values, for the expression ∞ − ∞ is undefined.)  One can prove by mathematical induction that an additive function satisfies       μ   (    ⋃   n  =  1   N    A  n    )    =    ∑   n  =  1   N    μ   (   A  n   )           μ    superscript   subscript     n  1    N    subscript  A  n       superscript   subscript     n  1    N     μ   subscript  A  n       \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{N}A_{n}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{N}\mu(A_{n})     for any     A  1   ,   A  2   ,  …  ,   A  N       subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-…   subscript  A  N     A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{N}   disjoint sets in   𝒜   𝒜   \scriptstyle\mathcal{A}   .  σ-additive set functions  Suppose that   𝒜   𝒜   \scriptstyle\mathcal{A}   is a σ-algebra . If for any sequence      A  1   ,   A  2   ,  …  ,   A  n   ,  …      subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-…   subscript  A  n   normal-…    A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{n},\dots   of disjoint sets in   𝒜   𝒜   \scriptstyle\mathcal{A}   , one has       μ   (    ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    μ   (   A  n   )           μ    superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n       superscript   subscript     n  1        μ   subscript  A  n       \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{n})        ,    absent   ,   we say that μ is countably additive or σ-additive . Any σ-additive function is additive but not vice versa, as shown below.  τ-additive set functions  Suppose that in addition to a sigma algebra   𝒜   𝒜   \scriptstyle\mathcal{A}   , we have a topology τ. If for any directed family of measurable open sets   𝒢   𝒢   \scriptstyle\mathcal{G}   ⊆   𝒜   𝒜   \scriptstyle\mathcal{A}   ∩τ,       μ   (   ⋃  𝒢   )    =    sup   G  ∈  𝒢     μ   (  G  )           μ    𝒢      subscript  supremum    G  𝒢      μ  G      \mu\left(\bigcup\mathcal{G}\right)=\sup_{G\in\mathcal{G}}\mu(G)        ,    absent   ,   we say that μ is τ-additive. In particular, if μ is inner regular then it is τ-additive. 1  Properties  Basic properties  Useful properties of an additive function μ include the following:   Either μ(∅) = 0, or μ assigns ∞ to all sets in its domain, or μ assigns −∞ to all sets in its domain.  If μ is non-negative and A ⊆ B , then μ( A ) ≤ μ( B ).  If A ⊆ B and μ( B ) − μ( A ) is defined, then μ( B \ A ) = μ( B ) − μ( A ).  Given A and B , μ( A ∪ B ) + μ( A ∩ B ) = μ( A ) + μ( B ).   Examples  An example of a σ-additive function is the function μ defined over the power set of the real numbers , such that       μ   (  A  )    =   {     1      if  0   ∈  A       0       if  0   ∉  A   .             μ  A    cases  1      if  0   A   0      if  0   A      \mu(A)=\begin{cases}1&\mbox{ if }0\in A\\
 0&\mbox{ if }0\notin A.\end{cases}     If     A  1   ,   A  2   ,  …  ,   A  n   ,  …      subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-…   subscript  A  n   normal-…    A_{1},A_{2},\dots,A_{n},\dots   is a sequence of disjoint sets of real numbers, then either none of the sets contains 0, or precisely one of them does. In either case, the equality       μ   (    ⋃   n  =  1   ∞    A  n    )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞    μ   (   A  n   )           μ    superscript   subscript     n  1       subscript  A  n       superscript   subscript     n  1        μ   subscript  A  n       \mu\left(\bigcup_{n=1}^{\infty}A_{n}\right)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\mu(A_{n})   holds.  See measure and signed measure for more examples of σ-additive functions.  An additive function which is not σ-additive  An example of an additive function which is not σ-additive is obtained by considering μ, defined over the Lebesgue sets of the real numbers by the formula        μ   (  A  )    =    lim   k  →  ∞       1  k   ⋅  λ    (   A  ∩   (  0  ,  k  )    )      ,        μ  A     subscript    normal-→  k        normal-⋅    1  k   λ     A   0  k        \mu(A)=\lim_{k\to\infty}\frac{1}{k}\cdot\lambda\left(A\cap\left(0,k\right)%
 \right),   where λ denotes the Lebesgue measure and lim the Banach limit .  One can check that this function is additive by using the linearity of the limit. That this function is not σ-additive follows by considering the sequence of disjoint sets       A  n   =   [  n  ,   n  +  1   )        subscript  A  n    n    n  1      A_{n}=\left[n,n+1\right)   for n =0, 1, 2, ... The union of these sets is the positive reals , and μ applied to the union is then one, while μ applied to any of the individual sets is zero, so the sum of μ( A n ) is also zero, which proves the counterexample.  Generalizations  One may define additive functions with values in any additive monoid (for example any group or more commonly a vector space ). For sigma-additivity, one needs in addition that the concept of limit of a sequence be defined on that set. For example, spectral measures are sigma-additive functions with values in a Banach algebra . Another example, also from quantum mechanics, is the positive operator-valued measure .
