The squirmer is a model for a spherical microswimmer swimming in Stokes flow. The squirmer model has been introduced by James Lighthill in 1952 and refined and used to model Paramecium by John Blake in 1971.1 2 Blake used the squirmer model to describe the flow generated by a carpet of beating short filaments called cilia on the surface of Paramecium. Today, the squirmer is a standard model for the study of self-propelled particles, such as Janus particles, in Stokes flow.3
Velocity field in particle frame
Here we give the flow field of a squirmer in the case of a non-deformable axisymmetric spherical squirmer (radius 
 
 
 
 ).45 These expressions are given in a spherical coordinate system.





Here 
 
 
 
  are constant coefficients, 
 
 
 
  are Legendre polynomials, and

 One finds

 The expressions above are in the frame of the moving particle. At the interface one finds

Swimming speed and lab frame
By using the Lorentz Reciprocal Theorem, one finds the velocity vector of the particle 
 
 
 
 . The flow in a fixed lab frame is given by

Structure of the flow and squirmer parameter
The series above are often truncated at

  characterizes a hydrodynamic stokeslet with decay

 ). The second mode 
 
 
 
  corresponds to a hydrodynamic stresslet or force dipole with decay

As can be seen in the figures above, the (lab frame) velocity field of the passive particle corresponds to a monopole. Furthermore, the 
 
 
 
  mode corresponds to a dipole (see case 
 
 
 
 ) and the 
 
 
 
  mode corresponds to a quadrupole (see cases 
 
 
 
 ).
