   Glycoprotein 2-beta-D-xylosyltransferase      Glycoprotein 2-beta-D-xylosyltransferase   In enzymology , a glycoprotein 2-beta-D-xylosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-D-xylose + N 4 -{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D- mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D- glucosaminyl}asparagine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + N 4 -{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-[beta-D- xylosyl-(1->2)]-beta-D-mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl- (1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl}asparagine   The 5 substrates of this enzyme are UDP-D-xylose , N4-{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- , [[acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D-]], mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D- , and glucosaminyl}asparagine , whereas its 5 products are UDP , N4-{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- , acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6) - beta-D- , [[xylosyl-(1->2)]-beta-D-mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-]], and (1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl}asparagine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-D-xylose:glycoprotein (D-xylose to the 3,6-disubstituted mannose of N4-{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N-a cetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D-man nosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glu cosaminyl}asparagine) 2-beta-D-xylosyltransferase . Other names in common use include beta1,2-xylosyltransferase , UDP-D-xylose:glycoprotein (D-xylose to the 3,6-disubstituted mannose , of , 4-N-{N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->3)-[N- , acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->2)-alpha-D-mannosyl-(1->6)]-beta-D- , mannosyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminyl-(1->4)-N-acetyl-beta-D- , and glucosaminyl}asparagine) 2-beta-D-xylosyltransferase .
