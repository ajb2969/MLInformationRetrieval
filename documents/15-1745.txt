Beta-D-glucopyranosyl abscisate beta-glucosidase

Beta-D-glucopyranosyl abscisate beta-glucosidase (, AtBG1, ABA-beta-D-glucosidase, ABA-specific beta-glucosidase, ABA-GE hydrolase, beta-D-glucopyranosyl abscisate hydrolase) is an enzyme with system name beta-D-glucopyranosyl abscisate glucohydrolase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-glucopyranosyl abscisate + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glucose + abscisate


The enzyme hydrolzes the biologically inactive beta-D-glucopyranosyl ester of abscisic acid to produce active abscisate.
