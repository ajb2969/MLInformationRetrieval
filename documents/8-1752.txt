Weakly o-minimal structure

In model theory, a weakly o-minimal structure is a model theoretic  structure whose definable sets in the domain are just finite unions of convex sets.
Definition
A linearly ordered structure, M, with language L including an ordering relation M.A.Dickmann, Elimination of Quantifiers for Ordered Valuation Rings, The Journal of symbolic Logic, Vol. 52, No. 1 (Mar., 1987), pp 116-128. 1
Difference from o-minimality
In an o-minimal structure $(M,<,...)$ the definable sets in $M$ are finite unions of points and intervals, where interval stands for a sets of the form $I=\{r\in M\,:\,a, for some ''a'' and ''b'' in . For weakly o-minimal structures $(M,<,...)$ this is relaxed so that the definable sets in M are finite unions of convex definable sets. A set $C$ is convex if whenever a and b are in $C$, a M satisfies that a 0
so that the set consists of all strictly positive real algebraic numbers that are less than π. The set is clearly convex, but cannot be written as a finite union of points and intervals whose endpoints are in R. To write it as an interval one would either have to include the endpoint π, which isn't in R, or one would require infinitely many intervals, such as the union
$$\bigcup_{\alpha<\pi}(0,\alpha).$$
Since we have a definable set that isn't a finite union of points and intervals, this structure is not o-minimal. However, it is known that the structure is weakly o-minimal, and in fact the theory of this structure is weakly o-minimal.1
