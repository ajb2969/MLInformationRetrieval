Multisymplectic integrator

In mathematics, a multisymplectic integrator is a numerical method for the solution of a certain class of partial differential equations, that are said to be multisymplectic. Multisymplectic integrators are geometric integrators, meaning that they preserve the geometry of the problems; in particular, the numerical method preserves energy and momentum in some sense, similar to the partial differential equation itself. Examples of multisymplectic integrators include the Euler box scheme and the Preissman box scheme.
Multisymplectic equations
A partial differential equation (PDE) is said to be a multisymplectic equation if it can be written in the form


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the unknown, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are (constant) skew-symmetric matrices and 
 
 
 
  denotes the gradient of 
 
 
 
 .1 This is a natural generalization of 
 
 
 
 , the form of a Hamiltonian ODE.2
Examples of multisymplectic PDEs include the nonlinear Klein–Gordon equation

 
 , or more generally the nonlinear wave equation 
 
 
 
 
 ,3 and the KdV equation

Define the 2-forms

 
  and 
 
 
 
  by


 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  denotes the dot product. The differential equation preserves symplecticity in the sense that


5 Taking the dot product of the PDE with 
 
 
 
  yields the local conservation law for energy:


6 The local conservation law for momentum is derived similarly:

The Euler box scheme
A multisymplectic integrator is a numerical method for solving multisymplectic PDEs whose numerical solution conserves a discrete form of symplecticity.8 One example is the Euler box scheme, which is derived by applying the symplectic Euler method to each independent variable.9
The Euler box scheme uses a splitting of the skewsymmetric matrices 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  of the form:


 
 
  For instance, one can take 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  to be the upper triangular part of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , respectively.10
Now introduce a uniform grid and let 
 
 
 
  denote the approximation to 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the grid spacing in the time- and space-direction. Then the Euler box scheme is


 
  where the finite difference operators are defined by


11 The Euler box scheme is a first-order method,12 which satisfies the discrete conservation law


13
Preissman box scheme
Another multisymplectic integrator is the Preissman box scheme, which was introduced by Preissman in the context of hyperbolic PDEs.14 It is also known as the centred cell scheme.15 The Preissman box scheme can be derived by applying the Implicit midpoint rule, which is a symplectic integrator, to each of the independent variables.16 This leads to the scheme


 
  where the finite difference operators 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are defined as above and the values at the half-integers are defined by


17 The Preissman box scheme is a second-order multisymplectic integrator which satisfies the discrete conservation law
