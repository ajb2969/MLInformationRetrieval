   Fekete problem      Fekete problem   In mathematics , the Fekete problem is, given a natural number N and a real s ≥ 0, to find the points x 1 ,..., x N on the 2-sphere for which the s -energy, defined by       ∑   1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  N      ∥    x  i   -   x  j    ∥    -  s        subscript       1  i       j       N      superscript   norm     subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j       s      \sum_{1\leq i     for s > 0 and by       ∑   1  ≤  i  <  j  ≤  N     log    ∥    x  i   -   x  j    ∥    -  1         subscript       1  i       j       N        superscript   norm     subscript  x  i    subscript  x  j       1       \sum_{1\leq i     for s = 0, is minimal. For s > 0, such points are called s - Fekete points , and for s = 0, logarithmic Fekete points (see ). More generally, one can consider the same problem on the d -dimensional sphere, or on a Riemannian manifold (in which case || x i − x j || is replaced with the Riemannian distance between x i and x j ).  The problem originated in the paper by  who considered the one-dimensional, s = 0 case, answering a question of Issai Schur .  An algorithmic version of the Fekete problem is number 7 on the list of problems discussed by .  References        "  Category:Mathematical analysis  Category:Approximation theory
