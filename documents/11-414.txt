3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase

In enzymology, a 3-phosphoglycerate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glycerate 3-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-glycerate + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-glycerate 3-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are D-glycerate and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glycerate-3-phosphate phosphohydrolase. Other names in common use include D-3-Phosphoglycerate phosphatase, and 3-PGA phosphatase. This enzyme participates in glycine, serine and threonine metabolism.
