Draft:Rollett Stability Factor



The Rollett Stability Factor (K-Factor), also known as the Rollett Invariant Stability Factor, is a tool in the design of electronic amplifiers, particularly broadband microwave amplifiers used in great numbers in modern telecommunication systems.12 It enables the designer to be aware of the possibility of oscillations which might cause the amplifier to malfunction. Stability in this context refers to "an amplifier's immunity to causing spurious oscillations".3
Definition
The purpose of the Rollett Stability Factor is to assess the possibility that deleterious feedback might occur under certain circumstances, rendering an electronic amplifier useless.
In audio systems a microphone collects a speaker’s words and after amplification broadcasts them via one or more loudspeakers to those present. On occasion howling occurs when part of the output from a loudspeaker is fed back (accidentally) to the microphone and amplified to excess, causing the speaker’s words to be lost.
In the case of electronic amplifiers using vacuum tubes, there is no path from the output back to the input, assuming simple precautions are used in the layout of the amplifier components. This is because the vacuum within the tube precludes any such feedback.
But in the case of integrated circuits there is a physical connection between the output and the input via the solid substrate on which the amplifier is built.
If the amplifier is described by scattering parameters, 
 
 
 
  then the feedback from output to input is characterized by the term 
 
 
 
 . The condition for the amplifier to be absolutely stable, that is to remain stable whatever the impedance of the source or the impedance of the load into which the amplifier feeds, is that the stability factor, K, should be greater than 1, where:456

It can be seen that the smaller 
 
 
 
  is the larger is K, that is the less the amount of internal feedback, the more stable the amplifier, as would be expected. However, if K https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_(physics) ; in this case the invariant is K.)
K is usually determined from measurements of the scattering parameters using the formula above. However because of its invariant character it can also be measured directly (and more accurately) from power gain measurements.
Here is an example showing a plot of the K-factor of an amplifier against frequency, calculated from the S-parameters supplied by an amplifier's manufacturer.7
(Figure)

It can be seen that the K-factor goes below 1 at around 4 GHz and also at around 6 GHz, indicating that problems may occur in these frequency regions.
Here is another example.8
(Figure)

It can be seen that this amplifier is liable to burst into oscillation over almost the whole frequency range.
It must be emphasized that when these amplifiers are fed from a resistive source and feed into a resistive load they are perfectly stable. Problems for the design engineer only arise when for example a band-limiting filter precedes or follows the amplifier, since such filters present widely-varying impedances. An experienced engineer will be aware of various ways of reducing or eliminating the risk of instability, the simplest of which is to introduce resistance somewhere into the design.
History
The Rollett Stability Factor is named after Dr John M. Rollett who formulated it during the 1950s while researching into the useful bandwidth of germanium transistors. The factor provided a main subject for his PHD9 and went on to have more practical applications than originally foreseen, especially in the design of microwave amplifiers. As a result his name has been placed in the Microwaves101 Hall of Fame.
