   Asymmetric norm      Asymmetric norm   In mathematics , an asymmetric norm on a vector space is a generalization of the concept of a norm .  Definition  Let X be a real vector space. Then an asymmetric norm on X is a function  p : X → R satisfying the following properties:   non-negativity: for all x ∈ X , p ( x ) ≥ 0;  definiteness : for x ∈ X , x = 0 if and only if  p ( x ) = p (− x ) = 0;  homogeneity : for all x ∈ X and all λ ≥ 0, p ( λx ) = λp ( x );  the triangle inequality : for all x , y ∈ X , p ( x + y ) ≤ p ( x ) + p ( y ).   Examples   On the real line  R , the function p given by          p   (  x  )    =   {       |  x  |   ,       x  ≤  0   ;         2   |  x  |    ,       x  ≥  0   ;             p  x    cases    x     x  0     2    x      x  0      p(x)=\begin{cases}|x|,&x\leq 0;\\
 2|x|,&x\geq 0;\end{cases}         is an asymmetric norm but not a norm.    More generally, given a convex absorbing subset K of a real vector space containing no non-zero subspace, the Minkowski functional p given by          p   (  x  )    =   inf   {   r  >  0   :   x  ∈   r  K    }          p  x    infimum   conditional-set    r  0     x    r  K        p(x)=\inf\left\{r>0:x\in rK\right\}\,         is an asymmetric norm but not necessarily a norm, unless K is also balanced.
