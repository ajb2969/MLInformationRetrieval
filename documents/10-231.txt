Asymmetric norm

In mathematics, an asymmetric norm on a vector space is a generalization of the concept of a norm.
Definition
Let X be a real vector space. Then an asymmetric norm on X is a function p : X → R satisfying the following properties:

non-negativity: for all x ∈ X, p(x) ≥ 0;
definiteness: for x ∈ X, x = 0 if and only if p(x) = p(−x) = 0;
homogeneity: for all x ∈ X and all λ ≥ 0, p(λx) = λp(x);
the triangle inequality: for all x, y ∈ X, p(x + y) ≤ p(x) + p(y).

Examples

On the real line R, the function p given by










is an asymmetric norm but not a norm.
 


More generally, given a convex absorbing subset K of a real vector space containing no non-zero subspace, the Minkowski functional p given by










is an asymmetric norm but not necessarily a norm, unless K is also balanced.
