   Capacity of a set      Capacity of a set   In mathematics , the capacity of a set in Euclidean space is a measure of that set's "size". Unlike, say, Lebesgue measure , which measures a set's volume or physical extent, capacity is a mathematical analogue of a set's ability to hold electrical charge . More precisely, it is the capacitance of the set: the total charge a set can hold while maintaining a given potential energy . The potential energy is computed with respect to an idealized ground at infinity for the harmonic or Newtonian capacity , and with respect to a surface for the condenser capacity .  Historical note  The notion of capacity of a set and of "capacitable" set was introduced by Gustave Choquet in 1950: for a detailed account, see reference .  Definitions  Condenser capacity  Let Σ be a closed , smooth, ( n − 1)- dimensional  hypersurface in n -dimensional Euclidean space ℝ n , n ≥ 3; K will denote the n -dimensional compact (i.e., closed and bounded ) set of which Σ is the boundary . Let S be another ( n − 1)-dimensional hypersurface that encloses Σ: in reference to its origins in electromagnetism , the pair (Σ, S ) is known as a condenser . The condenser capacity of Σ relative to S , denoted C (Σ, S ) or cap(Σ, S ), is given by the surface integral        C   (  Σ  ,  S  )    =   -    1    (   n  -  2   )    σ  n       ∫   S  ′        ∂  u    ∂  ν     d   σ  ′        ,        C   normal-Σ  S          1      n  2    subscript  σ  n       subscript    superscript  S  normal-′          u     ν    normal-d   superscript  σ  normal-′         C(\Sigma,S)=-\frac{1}{(n-2)\sigma_{n}}\int_{S^{\prime}}\frac{\partial u}{%
 \partial\nu}\,\mathrm{d}\sigma^{\prime},     where:   u is the unique harmonic function defined on the region D between Σ and S with the boundary conditions  u ( x ) = 1 on Σ and u ( x ) = 0 on S ;  S ′ is any intermediate surface between Σ and S ;  ν is the outward unit normal  field to S ′ and            ∂  u    ∂  ν     (  x  )    =      ∇  u    (  x  )    ⋅  ν    (  x  )              u     ν    x      normal-⋅     normal-∇  u   x   ν   x     \frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}(x)=\nabla u(x)\cdot\nu(x)         is the normal derivative of u across S ′; and    σ n = 2 π n ⁄2 ⁄ Γ( n ⁄ 2) is the surface area of the unit sphere in ℝ n .   C (Σ, S ) can be equivalently defined by the volume integral        C   (  Σ  ,  S  )    =    1    (   n  -  2   )    σ  n       ∫  D      |   ∇  u   |   2   d  x      .        C   normal-Σ  S        1      n  2    subscript  σ  n       subscript   D      superscript     normal-∇  u    2   normal-d  x       C(\Sigma,S)=\frac{1}{(n-2)\sigma_{n}}\int_{D}|\nabla u|^{2}\mathrm{d}x.     The condenser capacity also has a variational characterization : C (Σ, S ) is the infimum of the Dirichlet's energy  functional       I   [  v  ]    =    1    (   n  -  2   )    σ  n       ∫  D      |   ∇  v   |   2   d  x           I   delimited-[]  v        1      n  2    subscript  σ  n       subscript   D      superscript     normal-∇  v    2   normal-d  x       I[v]=\frac{1}{(n-2)\sigma_{n}}\int_{D}|\nabla v|^{2}\mathrm{d}x     over all continuously-differentiable functions  v on D with v ( x ) = 1 on Σ and v ( x ) = 0 on S .  Harmonic/Newtonian capacity  Heuristically , the harmonic capacity of K , the region bounded by Σ, can be found by taking the condenser capacity of Σ with respect to infinity. More precisely, let u be the harmonic function in the complement of K satisfying u = 1 on Σ and u ( x ) → 0 as x → ∞. Thus u is the Newtonian potential of the simple layer Σ. Then the harmonic capacity (also known as the Newtonian capacity ) of K , denoted C ( K ) or cap( K ), is then defined by        C   (  K  )    =    ∫    ℝ  n   ∖  K       |   ∇  u   |   2   d  x     .        C  K     subscript      superscript  ℝ  n   K       superscript     normal-∇  u    2   normal-d  x      C(K)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}\setminus K}|\nabla u|^{2}\mathrm{d}x.     If S is a rectifiable hypersurface completely enclosing K , then the harmonic capacity can be equivalently rewritten as the integral over S of the outward normal derivative of u :        C   (  K  )    =    ∫  S       ∂  u    ∂  ν     d  σ     .        C  K     subscript   S         u     ν    normal-d  σ      C(K)=\int_{S}\frac{\partial u}{\partial\nu}\,\mathrm{d}\sigma.     The harmonic capacity can also be understood as a limit of the condenser capacity. To wit, let S r denote the sphere of radius r about the origin in ℝ n . Since K is bounded, for sufficiently large r , S r will enclose K and (Σ, S r ) will form a condenser pair. The harmonic capacity is then the limit as r tends to infinity:        C   (  K  )    =    lim   r  →  ∞     C   (  Σ  ,   S  r   )      .        C  K     subscript    normal-→  r       C   normal-Σ   subscript  S  r        C(K)=\lim_{r\to\infty}C(\Sigma,S_{r}).     The harmonic capacity is a mathematically abstract version of the electrostatic capacity of the conductor K and is always non-negative and finite: 0 ≤ C ( K )  \nabla \cdot ( A \nabla u ) = 0  are minimizers of the associated energy functional       I   [  u  ]    =    ∫  D      (   ∇  u   )   T   A   (   ∇  u   )   d  x          I   delimited-[]  u      subscript   D      superscript   normal-∇  u   T   A   normal-∇  u   normal-d  x      I[u]=\int_{D}(\nabla u)^{T}A(\nabla u)\,\mathrm{d}x   subject to appropriate boundary conditions.  The capacity of a set E with respect to a domain D containing E is defined as the infimum of the energy over all continuously-differentiable functions  v on D with v ( x ) = 1 on E ; and v ( x ) = 0 on the boundary of D .  The minimum energy is achieved by a function known as the capacitary potential of E with respect to D , and it solves the obstacle problem on D with the obstacle function provided by the indicator function of E . The capacitary potential is alternately characterized as the unique solution of the equation with the appropriate boundary conditions.
