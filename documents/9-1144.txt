Impact parameter b and scattering angle θ.

The impact parameter

 
  is defined as the perpendicular distance between the path of a projectile and the center of the field 
 
 
 
  created by an object that the projectile is approaching (see diagram). It is often referred to in Nuclear Physics (see Rutherford Scattering), as well as in Classical Mechanics.
The impact parameter is related to the scattering angle 
 
 
 
  by1


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the velocity of the projectile when it is far from the center, and 
 
 
 
  is its closest distance from the center.
