   Impact parameter      Impact parameter   (Figure)  Impact parameter b and scattering angle θ.   The impact parameter    b   b   b   is defined as the perpendicular distance between the path of a projectile and the center of the field    U   (  r  )       U  r    U(r)   created by an object that the projectile is approaching (see diagram). It is often referred to in Nuclear Physics (see Rutherford Scattering ), as well as in Classical Mechanics .  The impact parameter is related to the scattering angle   θ   θ   \theta   by 1      θ  =   π  -   2  b    ∫   r  min   ∞     d  r     r  2     1  -    (   b  /  r   )   2   -     2  U   /  m    v  ∞  2               θ    π    2  b    superscript   subscript    subscript  r  min          d  r      superscript  r  2       1   superscript    b  r   2         2  U   m    superscript   subscript  v    2             \theta=\pi-2b\int_{r_{\mathrm{min}}}^{\infty}\frac{dr}{r^{2}\sqrt{1-(b/r)^{2}-%
