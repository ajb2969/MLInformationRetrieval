   Arias Intensity      Arias Intensity   The Arias Intensity ( I A ) is a measure of the strength of a ground motion . 1 It determines the intensity of shaking by measuring the acceleration of transient seismic waves . It has been found to be a fairly reliable parameter to describe earthquake shaking necessary to trigger landslides. 2 It was proposed by Chilean engineer Arturo Arias in 1970.  It is defined as the time- integral of the square of the ground acceleration :       I  A   =    π   2  g      ∫  0   T  d     a    (  t  )   2   d  t          subscript  I  A       π    2  g      superscript   subscript   0    subscript  T  d      a   superscript  t  2   d  t       I_{A}=\frac{\pi}{2g}\int_{0}^{T_{d}}a(t)^{2}dt   (m/s)  where g is the acceleration due to gravity and T d is the duration of signal above threshold. Theoretically the integral should be infinite. 3  The Arias Intensity could also alternatively be defined as the sum of all the squared acceleration values from seismic strong motion records. 4  References  "  Category:Seismology     ↩  ↩  ↩
