   Ferredoxin hydrogenase      Ferredoxin hydrogenase   In enzymology , a ferredoxin hydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   H 2 + 2 oxidized ferredoxin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 reduced ferredoxin + 2 H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are H 2 and oxidized ferredoxin , whereas its two products are reduced ferredoxin and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on hydrogen as donor with an iron-sulfur protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogen:ferredoxin oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include H2 oxidizing hydrogenase , H2 producing hydrogenase [ambiguous] , bidirectional hydrogenase , hydrogen-lyase [ambiguous] , hydrogenase (ferredoxin) , hydrogenase I , hydrogenase II , hydrogenlyase [ambiguous] , and uptake hydrogenase [ambiguous] . This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and methane metabolism . It has 3 cofactors : iron , Sulfur , and Nickel .
