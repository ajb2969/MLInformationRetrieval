Chirp mass

The chirp mass of a binary star system with component masses 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 .12 In general relativity, the chirp mass determines the leading-order amplitude and frequency evolution of the gravitational-wave signal emitted by the binary during its inspiral. Accordingly, the chirp mass can be accurately measured in gravitational-wave astronomy.
