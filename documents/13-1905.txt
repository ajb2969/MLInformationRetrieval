   Doomsday conjecture      Doomsday conjecture   In algebraic topology , the doomsday conjecture was a conjecture about Ext groups over the Steenrod algebra made by Joel Cohen, named by Michael Barratt, published by  and disproved by .  stated a modified version called the new doomsday conjecture .  The original doomsday conjecture was that for any prime p and positive integer s there are only a finite number of permanent cycles in        Ext   A  *    s  ,  *     (    Z  /  p   Z   ,    Z  /  p   Z   )    .       superscript   subscript  Ext   subscript  A      s          Z  p   Z       Z  p   Z      \text{Ext}_{A_{*}}^{s,*}(Z/pZ,Z/pZ).\,   found an infinite number of permanent cycles for p = s = 2, disproving the conjecture. Minami's new doomsday conjecture is a weaker form stating (in the case p = 2) that there are no nontrivial permanent cycles in the image of (Sq 0 ) n for n sufficiently large depending on s .
