   Binary octahedral group      Binary octahedral group   In mathematics , the binary octahedral group , name as 2O or  is a certain nonabelian group of order 48. It is an extension of the octahedral group  O or (2,3,4) of order 24 by a cyclic group of order 2, and is the preimage of the octahedral group under the 2:1 covering homomorphism      Spin   (  3  )    →   SO   (  3  )       normal-→   Spin  3    SO  3     \operatorname{Spin}(3)\to\operatorname{SO}(3)   of the special orthogonal group by the spin group . It follows that the binary octahedral group is a discrete subgroup of Spin(3) of order 48.  The binary octahedral group is most easily described concretely as a discrete subgroup of the unit quaternions , under the isomorphism     Spin   (  3  )    ≅   Sp   (  1  )         Spin  3    Sp  1     \operatorname{Spin}(3)\cong\operatorname{Sp}(1)   where Sp(1) is the multiplicative group of unit quaternions. (For a description of this homomorphism see the article on quaternions and spatial rotations .)  Elements  Explicitly, the binary octahedral group is given as the union of the 24 Hurwitz units      {   ±  1   ,   ±  i   ,   ±  j   ,   ±  k   ,     1  2     (    ±  1   ±  i  ±  j  ±  k   )    }      plus-or-minus  1    plus-or-minus  i    plus-or-minus  j    plus-or-minus  k       1  2    plus-or-minus   plus-or-minus  1   i  j  k      \{\pm 1,\pm i,\pm j,\pm k,\tfrac{1}{2}(\pm 1\pm i\pm j\pm k)\}   with all 24 quaternions obtained from        1   2      (     ±  1   ±   1  i    +   0  j   +   0  k    )         1    2       plus-or-minus   plus-or-minus  1     1  i      0  j     0  k      \tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(\pm 1\pm 1i+0j+0k)   by a permutation of coordinates (all possible sign combinations). All 48 elements have absolute value 1 and therefore lie in the unit quaternion group Sp(1).  Properties  The binary octahedral group, denoted by 2 O , fits into the short exact sequence      1  →   {   ±  1   }   →   2  O   →  O  →   1.        normal-→  1    plus-or-minus  1      normal-→      2  O     normal-→    O    normal-→    1.     1\to\{\pm 1\}\to 2O\to O\to 1.\,   This sequence does not split , meaning that 2 O is not a semidirect product of {±1} by O . In fact, there is no subgroup of 2 O isomorphic to O .  The center of 2 O is the subgroup {±1}, so that the inner automorphism group is isomorphic to O . The full automorphism group is isomorphic to O × Z 2 .  Presentation  The group 2 O has a presentation given by      ⟨   r  ,  s  ,  t   ∣    r  2   =   s  3   =   t  4   =   r  s  t    ⟩     inner-product   r  s  t        superscript  r  2    superscript  s  3         superscript  t  4          r  s  t       \langle r,s,t\mid r^{2}=s^{3}=t^{4}=rst\rangle   or equivalently,       ⟨   s  ,  t   ∣     (   s  t   )   2   =   s  3   =   t  4    ⟩   .     inner-product   s  t        superscript    s  t   2    superscript  s  3         superscript  t  4       \langle s,t\mid(st)^{2}=s^{3}=t^{4}\rangle.   Generators with these relations are given by        s  =     1  2     (   1  +  i  +  j  +  k   )      t  =     1   2      (   1  +  i   )      .     formulae-sequence    s      1  2     1  i  j  k       t      1    2      1  i       s=\tfrac{1}{2}(1+i+j+k)\qquad t=\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}(1+i).     Subgroups  The quaternion group consisting of the 8 Lipschitz units forms a normal subgroup of 2 O of index 6. The quotient group is isomorphic to S 3 (the symmetric group on 3 letters). The binary tetrahedral group , consisting of the 24 Hurwitz units , forms a normal subgroup of index 2. These two groups, together with the center {±1}, are the only nontrivial normal subgroups of 2 O .  The generalized quaternion group of order 16 also forms a subgroup of 2 O . This subgroup is self-normalizing so its conjugacy class has 3 members. There are also isomorphic copies of the binary dihedral groups of orders 8 and 12 in 2 O . All other subgroups are cyclic groups generated by the various elements (with orders 3, 4, 6, and 8).  Higher dimensions  The binary octahedral group generalizes to higher dimensions: just as the octahedron generalizes to the hyperoctahedron , the octahedral group in SO(3) generalizes to the hyperoctahedral group in SO( n ), which has a binary cover under the map      Spin   (  n  )    →   S  O   (  n  )     .     normal-→   Spin  n     S  O  n     \operatorname{Spin}(n)\to SO(n).
