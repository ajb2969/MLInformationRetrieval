   Schoch line      Schoch line   (Figure)  The Schoch line (cyan) passes through the point A 1 .   In geometry , the Schoch line is a line defined from an arbelos and named by Peter Woo after Thomas Schoch, who had studied it in conjunction with the Schoch circles .  Construction  An arbelos is a shape bounded by three mutually-tangent semicircular arcs with collinear endpoints, with the two smaller arcs nested inside the larger one; let the endpoints of these three arcs be (in order along the line containing them) A , B , and C . Let K 1 and K 2 be two more arcs, centered at A and C , respectively, with radii AB and CB , so that these two arcs are tangent at B ; let K 3 be the largest of the three arcs of the arbelos. A circle, with the center A 1 , is then created tangent to the arcs K 1 , K 2 , and K 3 . This circle is congruent with Archimedes' twin circles , making it an Archimedean circle ; it is one of the Schoch circles . The Schoch line is perpendicular to the line AC and passes through the point A 1 . It is also the location of the centers of infinitely many Archimedean circles, e.g. the Woo circles . 1  Radius and center of A 1  If r = AB / AC , and AC = 1, then the radius of A 1 is      ρ  =    1  2   r   (   1  -  r   )        ρ      1  2   r    1  r      \rho=\frac{1}{2}r\left(1-r\right)     and the center is       (   r   (   1  -  r   )       (   1  +  r   )    (   2  -  r   )       ,    1  2   r   (    1  +   3  r    -   2   r  2     )    )   .       r    1  r         1  r     2  r          1  2   r      1    3  r      2   superscript  r  2        \left(r\left(1-r\right)\sqrt{\left(1+r\right)\left(2-r\right)}~{},~{}\frac{1}{%
