The tessellation fills space by 8-simplex , rectified 8-simplex , birectified 8-simplex , and trirectified 8-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 1:1:1:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.  A8 lattice  This vertex arrangement is called the A8 lattice or 8-simplex lattice . The 72 vertices of the expanded 8-simplex vertex figure represent the 72 roots of the     A  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  A   8    {\tilde{A}}_{8}   Coxeter group. 1 It is the 8-dimensional case of a simplectic honeycomb . Around each vertex figure are 510 facets: 9+9 8-simplex , 36+36 rectified 8-simplex , 84+84 birectified 8-simplex , 126+126 trirectified 8-simplex , with the count distribution from the 10th row of Pascal's triangle .       E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   contains     A  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  A   8    {\tilde{A}}_{8}   as a subgroup of index 5760. 2 Both     E  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  E   8    {\tilde{E}}_{8}   and     A  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  A   8    {\tilde{A}}_{8}   can be seen as affine extensions of    A  8     subscript  A  8    A_{8}   from different nodes:  The A     8     3     subscript   superscript  absent  3   8    {}^{3}_{8}   lattice is the union of three A 8 lattices, and also identical to the E8 lattice .    ∪  ∪  = .    The A     8     *     subscript   superscript  absent    8    {}^{*}_{8}   lattice (also called A     8     9     subscript   superscript  absent  9   8    {}^{9}_{8}   ) is the union of nine A 8 lattices, and has the vertex arrangement of the dual honeycomb to the omnitruncated 8-simplex honeycomb , and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is an omnitruncated 8-simplex      ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  ∪  = dual of .  Related polytopes and honeycombs  Projection by folding  The 8-simplex honeycomb can be projected into the 4-dimensional tesseractic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement :           A  ~   8     subscript   normal-~  A   8    {\tilde{A}}_{8}                C  ~   4     subscript   normal-~  C   4    {\tilde{C}}_{4}         See also   Regular and uniform honeycombs in 8-space:  8-cubic honeycomb  8-demicubic honeycomb  Truncated 8-simplex honeycomb  5 21 honeycomb  2 51 honeycomb  1 52 honeycomb    Notes  References   Norman Johnson  Uniform Polytopes , Manuscript (1991)  Kaleidoscopes: Selected Writings of H.S.M.
