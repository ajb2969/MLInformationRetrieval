 ×2, [[3[9]]] |- |Properties||vertex-transitive |} In eighth-dimensional Euclidean geometry, the 8-simplex honeycomb is a space-filling tessellation (or honeycomb). The tessellation fills space by 8-simplex, rectified 8-simplex, birectified 8-simplex, and trirectified 8-simplex facets. These facet types occur in proportions of 1:1:1:1 respectively in the whole honeycomb.
A8 lattice
This vertex arrangement is called the A8 lattice or 8-simplex lattice. The 72 vertices of the expanded 8-simplex vertex figure represent the 72 roots of the 
 
 
 
  Coxeter group.1 It is the 8-dimensional case of a simplectic honeycomb. Around each vertex figure are 510 facets: 9+9 8-simplex, 36+36 rectified 8-simplex, 84+84 birectified 8-simplex, 126+126 trirectified 8-simplex, with the count distribution from the 10th row of Pascal's triangle.

The A
 
 
 
  lattice is the union of three A8 lattices, and also identical to the E8 lattice.

The A
 
 
 
  lattice (also called A
 
 
 
 ) is the union of nine A8 lattices, and has the vertex arrangement of the dual honeycomb to the omnitruncated 8-simplex honeycomb, and therefore the Voronoi cell of this lattice is an omnitruncated 8-simplex

Projection by folding
The 8-simplex honeycomb can be projected into the 4-dimensional tesseractic honeycomb by a geometric folding operation that maps two pairs of mirrors into each other, sharing the same vertex arrangement:
