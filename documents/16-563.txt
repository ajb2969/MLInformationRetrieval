   Simplicial commutative ring      Simplicial commutative ring   In algebra, a simplicial commutative ring is a commutative monoid in the category of simplicial abelian groups , or, equivalently, a simplicial object in the category of commutative rings. If A is a simplicial commutative ring, then it can be shown that     π  0   A       subscript  π  0   A    \pi_{0}A   is a commutative ring and     π  i   A       subscript  π  i   A    \pi_{i}A   are modules over that ring (in fact,     π  *   A       subscript  π    A    \pi_{*}A   is a graded ring over     π  0   A       subscript  π  0   A    \pi_{0}A   .)  A topology-counterpart of this notion is a commutative ring spectrum .  Graded ring structure  Let A be a simplicial commutative ring. Then the ring structure of A gives      π  *   A   =    ⊕   i  ≥  0      π  i   A           subscript  π    A     subscript  direct-sum    i  0       subscript  π  i   A      \pi_{*}A=\oplus_{i\geq 0}\pi_{i}A   the structure of a graded-commutative graded ring as follows.  By the Dold–Kan correspondence ,     π  *   A       subscript  π    A    \pi_{*}A   is the homology of the chain complex corresponding to A ; in particular, it is a graded abelian group. Next, to multiply two elements, writing    S  1     superscript  S  1    S^{1}   for the circle, let    x  :     (   S  1   )    ∧  i    →   A  ,  y    :     (   S  1   )    ∧  j    →  A        normal-:  x   normal-→   superscript   superscript  S  1     i     A  y      normal-:     normal-→   superscript   superscript  S  1     j    A      x:(S^{1})^{\wedge i}\to A,\,\,y:(S^{1})^{\wedge j}\to A   be two maps. Then the composition         (   S  1   )    ∧  i    ×    (   S  1   )    ∧  j     →   A  ×  A   →  A       normal-→     superscript   superscript  S  1     i     superscript   superscript  S  1     j       A  A     normal-→    A     (S^{1})^{\wedge i}\times(S^{1})^{\wedge j}\to A\times A\to A   , the second map the multiplication of A , induces       (   S  1   )    ∧  i    ∧    (   S  1   )    ∧  j     →  A     normal-→     superscript   superscript  S  1     i     superscript   superscript  S  1     j     A    (S^{1})^{\wedge i}\wedge(S^{1})^{\wedge j}\to A   . This in turn gives an element in     π   i  +  j    A       subscript  π    i  j    A    \pi_{i+j}A   . We have thus defined the graded multiplication        π  i   A   ×   π  j    A   →    π   i  +  j    A      normal-→         subscript  π  i   A    subscript  π  j    A      subscript  π    i  j    A     \pi_{i}A\times\pi_{j}A\to\pi_{i+j}A   . It is associative since the smash product is. It is graded-commutative (i.e.,     x  y   =     (   -  1   )     |  x  |    |  y  |     y  x         x  y      superscript    1       x     y     y  x     xy=(-1)^{|x||y|}yx   ) since the involution      S  1   ∧   S  1    →    S  1   ∧   S  1       normal-→     superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1       superscript  S  1    superscript  S  1      S^{1}\wedge S^{1}\to S^{1}\wedge S^{1}   introduces minus sign.  Spec  By definition, the category of affine derived schemes is the opposite category of the category of simplicial commutative rings; an object corresponding to A will be denoted by    Spec  A     Spec  A    \operatorname{Spec}A   .
