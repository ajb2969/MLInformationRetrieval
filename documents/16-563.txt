Simplicial commutative ring

In algebra, a simplicial commutative ring is a commutative monoid in the category of simplicial abelian groups, or, equivalently, a simplicial object in the category of commutative rings. If A is a simplicial commutative ring, then it can be shown that 
 
 
 
  is a commutative ring and 
 
 
 
  are modules over that ring (in fact, 
 
 
 
  is a graded ring over 
 
 
 
 .)
A topology-counterpart of this notion is a commutative ring spectrum.
Graded ring structure
Let A be a simplicial commutative ring. Then the ring structure of A gives 
 
 
 
  the structure of a graded-commutative graded ring as follows.
By the Dold–Kan correspondence, 
 
 
 
  is the homology of the chain complex corresponding to A; in particular, it is a graded abelian group. Next, to multiply two elements, writing 
 
 
 
  for the circle, let 
 
 
 
  be two maps. Then the composition


 
 , the second map the multiplication of A, induces 
 
 
 
 . This in turn gives an element in 
 
 
 
 . We have thus defined the graded multiplication 
 
 
 
 . It is associative since the smash product is. It is graded-commutative (i.e., 
 
 
 
 ) since the involution 
 
 
 
  introduces minus sign.
Spec
By definition, the category of affine derived schemes is the opposite category of the category of simplicial commutative rings; an object corresponding to A will be denoted by 
 
 
 
 .
