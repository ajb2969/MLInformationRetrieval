   Aerodynamic center      Aerodynamic center   The torques or moments acting on an airfoil moving through a fluid can be accounted for by the net lift applied at some point on the airfoil, and a separate net pitching moment about that point whose magnitude varies with the choice of where the lift is chosen to be applied. The aerodynamic center is the point at which the pitching moment coefficient for the airfoil does not vary with lift coefficient (i.e. angle of attack ), so this choice makes analysis simpler . 1        d   C  m     d   C  L     =  0          d   subscript  C  m      d   subscript  C  L     0    {dC_{m}\over dC_{L}}=0   where    C  L     subscript  C  L    C_{L}   is the aircraft lift coefficient .  In other words, the aerodynamic center is the point on the airfoil where the incremental lift (due to change in Angle of Attack) will act. And, since the lift force generated due to change of angle of attack passes through this point, the moment generated about this point will be zero. The concept of the aerodynamic center (AC) is important in aerodynamics . It is fundamental in the science of stability of aircraft in flight.  For symmetric airfoils in subsonic flight the aerodynamic center is located approximately 25% of the chord from the leading edge of the airfoil. This point is described as the quarter-chord point. This result also holds true for ' thin-airfoils '. For non-symmetric ( cambered ) airfoils the quarter-chord is only an approximation for the aerodynamic center.  A similar concept is that of center of pressure . The location of the center of pressure varies with changes of lift coefficient and angle of attack. This makes the center of pressure unsuitable for use in analysis of longitudinal static stability . Read about movement of centre of pressure .
