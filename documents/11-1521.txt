   Hygromycin-B kinase      Hygromycin-B kinase   In enzymology , a hygromycin-B kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + hygromycin B   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 7"-O-phosphohygromycin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and hygromycin B , whereas its two products are ADP and 7''-O-phosphohygromycin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:hygromycin-B 7"-O-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called hygromycin B phosphotransferase .
