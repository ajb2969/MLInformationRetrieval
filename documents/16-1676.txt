   Draft:Leaving Certificate Mathematics Ordinary Level      Draft:Leaving Certificate Mathematics Ordinary Level     Leaving Certificate - Ordinary Level Mathematics  Leaving Certificate Mathematics (Ordinary level) is a two-year course of study in Mathematics taken by secondary level students in Ireland. The subject is assessed by two 150-minute external examination papers at the end of the course.The Ordinary level course is one of three levels this subject can be studied at in the Leaving Certificate . The syllabus for the course consists of five strands:Probability and Statistics,Geometry and Trigonometry,Number, Algebra and Functions.  Strand 1:Probability and Statistics  The aim of the probability unit is two-fold: it provides certain understandings intrinsic to problem solving and it underpins the statistics unit. It is expected that the conduct of experiments(including simulations), both individually and in groups, will form the primary vehicle through which the knowledge, understanding and skills in probability are developed. References should be made to appropriate contexts and applications of probability.  It is envisaged that throughout the statistics course learners will be involved in identifying problems that can be explored by the use of appropriate data, designing investigations, collecting data, exploring and using patterns and relationships in data, solving problems, and communicating findings. This strand also involves interpreting statistical information, evaluating data-based arguments, and dealing with uncertainty and variation  As they engage with this strand and make connections across other strands, learners develop and reinforce their synthesis and problem-solving skills.At each syllabus level students should be able to:    explore patterns and formulate conjectures  explain findings  justify conclusions  communicate mathematics verbally and in written form  apply their knowledge and skills to solve problems in familiar and unfamiliar contexts  analyse information presented verbally and translate it into mathematical form  devise, select and use appropriate mathematical models, formulae or techniques to process information and to draw relevant conclusions. 1   Statistics   Statistical investigations  Statistical investigations involve a well-defined step-by-step procedure known as the PCAI "statistical investigation cycle" 2 . This involves four stages:   The Four stages of statistical investigation   Stage 1: P ose a question  Stage 2: C ollect relevant data  Stage 3: A nalyse the data  Stage 4: I nterpret the results                 Data collected from a statistical investigation can be divided into a number of different types as follows:                 Categorical data types   Ordinal data: categorical data is data that can be ordered in some way e.g. exam results(A,B,C,D,E,F, NG) blood pressure (Low, medium, high), and similarly social class (Low, high, or middle class).  Collecting Data  Statistical data can be collected in different ways. The most common way of collecting data is through a survey. There are several ways to carry out a survey:    Face-to-face interviews  Telephone interviews   Questionnaire that is sent out by post  Online Questionnaire  Observation   Frequency tables  Data collected is often summarized in a table known as a frequency table like the one shown below. The frequency is just a measure of how often something repeats. In this case for example, the frequency is a measure of the number of times people said yes or no.                   Graphing Data  Stem and leaf diagrams  Histograms  In a histogram, the area of the bar represent the frequency.  Scatter Graphs and Correlation  Measures of Central Tendency  Measures of Spread  The Normal Distribution and Empirical Rule  Misuses of Statistics  Counting and Permutations     Outcomes  Suppose we wish to observe some process or experiment in which the outcome is not known in advance.For example, suppose we plan to select a card from a standard deck of playing cards and we're interested in the number of one type of card or another that can be selected. Before we can talk about the probability of selecting a particular card, we have to understand what outcomes are possible in this experiment. One way to do this is to list all the possible outcomes(i.e.the sample space ).  Listing Outcomes  Three different methods of listing outcomes are examined in the Leaving Certificate Ordinary level Mathematics course : systematic listing , two-way tables and tree diagrams .  1.Systematic Listing:  Systematic writing involves writing down all the possible outcomes(i.e. the sample space, S) in a list, separated by commas.   Example 1: A die is thrown. List all the possible outcomes.  Solution: The possible outcomes of rolling a die are: S= {1,2,3,4,5,6}         Example 2: A coin is flipped once, what are all the possible outcomes?  Solution: If H= Heads and T= Tails, then the possible outcomes are: S={H,T}        Note:   In the above examples,the order in which the possible outcomes are listed is not important i.e. S = { H , T } is the same as S = { T , H }.   2.Two-way tables:  If the experiment involves a number of outcomes in the sample space, then systematic listing can take a long time and get rather difficult.Two-way tables provide a good way of showing the possible outcomes when there are two sets of outcomes     Example: Two coins are flipped once, what are all the possible outcomes?  Solution:  We can construct a two-way table like the one below and list all the possible outcomes. Each pair of outcomes is listed in the table as: { outcome of first die , outcome of second die }        First Die (Outcomes)       Heads     Second Die(Outcomes)   Heads   {H,H}     Tails   {H,T}   (T,T}          3.Tree diagrams:  A tree diagram is another useful method of listing the possible outcomes. This method gets its name from the fact that the diagram looks like the branches of a tree.This method is useful when there are two or more events i.e. multiple stages. 3   Example: A coin is flipped twice. List all the possible outcomes.  Solution: There are two possible outcomes from the first flip, and two possible outcomes from the second flip, these are shown below using a tree diagram:       The Fundamental Principle of Counting  For a single event, we have seen above how the possible outcomes may often be written down and counted. However, if an experiment involves determining the number of possible outcomes from two or more events then the fundamental principle of counting can be used.   The Fundamental principle of counting:  If one event has m possible outcomes and a second event has n possible outcomes, then the total number of possible outcomes is m  x n .      Example: A coin is flipped once, then a die is rolled.How many different outcomes are possible?  Solution: The number of outcomes for the first event - the coin being flipped - is 2: {H,T}. The number of outcomes for the second event - the die being rolled - is 6: {1,2,3,4,5,6}. Therefore, the total number of possible outcomes is:      m  x  n   =    (  2  )   x   (  6  )    =  12          m  x  n     2  x  6        12     mxn=(2)x(6)=12        Arrangements  Factorials  Before we move onto the topic of arrangements,you will need to learn about something called a factorial .  For example,    6  !      6    6!   (pronounced '6 factorial') is the product:      6  x  5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1      6  x  5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1    6x5x4x3x2x1     Note, that in this product, the numbers start at 6, and are listed in descending order.  The formal definition of a factorial is as follows:   The factorial n! is defined for a positive integer n as n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...3.2.1      Example : Calculate 10!.  Solution:         10  !   =   10  x  9  x  8  x  7  x  6  x  5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1   =  3   ,   628  ,  800      formulae-sequence        10     10  x  9  x  8  x  7  x  6  x  5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1        3     628  800     10!=10x9x8x7x6x5x4x3x2x1=3,628,800   .  Alternatively,you can use the factorial button         on your calculator. Just enter 10 on your calculator followed by the n! button and then hit the equals sign, which should also give you the answer 3,628,800.     Arrangements  We will consider the simplest case first, that is, an arrangement where there are no restrictions .   Example: Find the number of ways the letters of the word IRELAND can be arranged if there are no restrictions.  Note: No letter may be used more than once  Solution:  Since there are no restrictions on how the letters can be arranged, we can arrange them in any order  EXAM TIP: Arranging these 7 letters in a particular order is equivalent to filling 7 empty compartments one at a time, and therefore it can be useful to draw 7 empty boxes, one for each choice, when answering questions like this.   Firstly,we note that there are 7 letters in the word IRELAND.  For the first letter of the arrangement, we have a choice of 7 letters.     Once the first letter is chosen, we are left with a choice of 6 letters for the second letter in our arrangement. This continues until we come to the last letter, where there is only one choice left.   The Fundamental principle of counting (see Fundamental principle of counting )tells us that if there are 7 possible letters that can go in position 1, and 6 possible letters that can go in position 2 etc., all the way down to 1 possible letter that can go into the last position, then there are:        7  x  6  x  5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1   =   7  !   =  5   ,  040     formulae-sequence        7  x  6  x  5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1     7        5    040    7x6x5x4x3x2x1=7!=5,040   possible arrangements    In the next example, we consider the case where there is a single restriction .   Example: Find the number of ways the letters of the word IRELAND can be arranged if the first letter of each arrangement must begin with a D.  Note: As with the previous example, no letter may be used more than once.  Solution:  If the arrangements must begin with the letter P then:   The first letter must be D(there is only one D, so therefore is only one choice for the first letter).  This means that there are 6 letters left to choose from for our second choice, 5 letters to choose from for our third choice, and so on.   Again using the fundamental principle of counting, the number of possible arrangements are:       1  x  6  x  5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1   =   1  x   6  !    =  720          1  x  6  x  5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1     1  x    6         720     1x6x5x4x3x2x1=1x6!=720   possible arrangements     In the next example, we consider the case where there is a single restriction of a different kind.   Example: Find the number of ways the letters of the word IRELAND can be arranged if the first letter of each arrangement must NOT begin with a D.  Solution:   In the first example(where there were no restrictions), we calculated that the total number of possible arrangements of the letters in the word IRELAND was: 5,040, and in the second example we determined that of this number, 720 of those arrangements began with the letter D.  This means that, all the rest of the arrangements do not start with the letter D. Therefore, the number of arrangements that do not start with the letter D is given by the formula:  Number of arrangements not beginning with D = (Total number of arrangements) -( number arrangements beginning with D)  i.e.     5  ,   040  -  720    =  4320       5    040  720    4320    5,040-720=4320   possible arrangements      In the next example,we consider the case where there are multiple restrictions   Example: Find the number of ways the letters of the word IRELAND can be arranged if the first letter of each arrangement must begin with a vowel and the last letter must be a consonant.  Note: As with the previous examples, no letter can be used more than once.  Solution:   The first letter must be a vowel.There are only 3 vowels (I,E,A), so therefore, there are 3 choices for the first letter.  The last letter must be a consonant.There are 4 consonants (R,L,N,D), so therefore, there are 4 choices for the last letter.  Once the first letter has been chosen, and the last letter has been chosen, that leaves 5 other letters to chose from  This means there are:      3  x   (   5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1   )   x  4   =   3  x   5  !   x  4   =   12  x   5  !    =  1440          3  x    5  x  4  x  3  x  2  x  1   x  4     3  x    5   x  4          12  x    5         1440     3x(5x4x3x2x1)x4=3x5!x4=12x5!=1440   possible arrangements      EXAM TIP: If you are asked to find the number of arrangements, but a restriction is imposed(or multiple restrictions are imposed), always examine the restriction (or multiple restrictions) first, before filling in the other choices.  Permutations  In the section on Arrangements we calculated the number of ways that the letters of the word IRELAND could be arranged if there were no restrictions, and no letter was used again in subsequent choices. We will see in this section that this is really just a special case of a broader class of arrangements known as permutations.  Let's take a simple example. Consider the letters a, b and c. These can be arranged in the following ways:   abc  acb  bac  bca  cab  cba   Thus, there are only six permutations (or arrangements) of the letters a,b,c if there are no restrictions, and no letter is repeated.  We know this because there are 3 choices for the first letter,and once the first letter is chosen, that leaves two choices, which leaves only 1 choice for the final letter, and according to the fundamental principle of counting, this means there are:      3  x  2  x  1   =   3  !   =  6          3  x  2  x  1     3        6     3x2x1=3!=6   possible arrangements (or permutations).  Probability   This section on probability builds on the concepts and skills introduced in the previous section, Counting and Permutations , so if you are unfamiliar with counting and permutations, you should familiarise yourself with the material in the previous section before proceeding.  Measuring probability:The Probability Scale  Probability is all about assigning a numerical value to the likelihood or chance of a random event occurring. We can view this numerical value as a value on a scale, similar to the way we can view temperatures on a thermometer.  (Figure)  The probability scale|500px     The main features of the probability scale are as follows:   If an event has no chance of occurring,i.e. it is impossible,then we assign it a probability of zero.  If, on the other hand, an event is certain to happen then it is assigned a probability of 1.  If an event has an equally likely chance of happening as it has of not happening, then it is assigned a probability half way between zero(impossible) and 1(certain)i.e it has a probability of a half or 0.5.  If an event has a value between zero and 0.5 on the probability scale, we say it is "improbable" or "less likely" to occur  If an event has a value between 0.5 and 1 on the probability, then we say it is "probable" or "more likely" to occur.   Basic Axioms of Probability  There are 3 major rules of probability which you should know as follows:   The probability of any event is between zero and 1 (as already described above)  The probability of an event happening, plus the probability of the event not happening must equal 1  The sum of the probabilities of all the outcomes must equal 1   Experienced teachers will recognise these as Kolmogorov's Probability_axioms .  Approaches to probability  There are three main approaches to probability. The Leaving Certificate Ordinary Level syllabus includes two of these approaches - the classical (or ' a priori ') approach and the relative frequency approach(The third approach, which is not part of the Leaving Certificate Mathematics course,is the subjective - or Bayesian - approach).Both of these approaches are examined in the preceding section.   1.The Classical (or 'a priori') approach  This approach began with games of chance , such as throwing dice, or playing cards.In this method the probability of an event is calculated by a process of logic . No experiment or judgement is required. For example, the probability of a coin landing on heads can be calculated by noting that the coin has 2 sides, both of which are equally likely to land upwards. Since our basic axioms tell us that the two events must share equally the total probability of 1, therefore, the probability of getting a head must be 0.5, and equally, the probability of getting a tail must also be 0.5. 4  2.The Relative Frequency (or 'experimental') approach  In contrast to the classical approach,the relative frequency approach, which was developed sometime after the classical approach, involves experiment and observation . It is based on the Law of large numbers , which in simple terms states that, if a trial is repeated a sufficiently large number of times, then the outcome of the trials will approach the actual probability. For example, if a coin is flipped 20 times, and the number heads is recorded as six, then the relative frequency is 6/20 or 0.3.If the coin is flipped a further 20 times, and this time we observe that 10 of these result in a head, then the relative frequency of heads now becomes: 16/40 or 0.4. It should be clear from this, that the more trials that we perform that the closer the relative frequency becomes to the actual probability.  Probability of Simple Events  A Simple Event is defined as an event which results in a single outcome.e.g. When a coin is flipped, there is only one outcome, either a head or a tail.Similarly, if a single card is selected from a standard deck of playing cards, then there will only be one single outcome.  To calculate the probability of a simple event we use the formula:      In mathematical terms, this is expressed as:    where, the probability of an event we are interested in is P(E),the number of favourable events is #E(which is read as "the cardinal number of E"), and the total number of possible outcomes in the sample space S , is #S(which is read as "the cardinal number of S").   Example 1: A fair die is rolled, what is the probability of getting a six?  Solution: There are six possible outcomes in the sample space, S ={ 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 },therefore #S = 6. The event we want to happen is E = { 6 },and since there is only one possible way in which this outcome can occur,therefore the number of favourable outcomes #E = 1 , and therefore the probability of a 6 is:       P   (  6  )    =   1  6         P  6     1  6     P(6)=\frac{1}{6}         Example 2: A fair die is rolled, what is the probability of getting an odd number?  Solution: There are six possible outcomes in the sample space, S={1,2,3,4,5,6}.Therefore, #S=6.There are 3 possible odd numbers, i.e. E={1,3,5}, therefore, #E=3 so the probability of an odd number is:       P   (   o  d  d   )    =   3  6         P    o  d  d      3  6     P(odd)=\frac{3}{6}         =   1  2       absent    1  2     =\frac{1}{2}   [divide above and below by 3]     Compound Events    Strand 2:Geometry and Trigonometry  The synthetic geometry covered at Leaving Certificate is a continuation of that studied at junior cycle. It is based on the Geometry for Post-primary School Mathematics, including terms, definitions, axioms, propositions,theorems, converses and corollaries. The formal underpinning for the system of post-primary geometry is that described by Barry (2001). 5  At Ordinary and Higher level, knowledge of geometrical results from the corresponding syllabus level at Junior Certificate is assumed. It is also envisaged that, at all levels, learners will engage with a dynamic geometry software package.  In particular, at Foundation level and Ordinary level learners should first encounter the geometrical results below through investigation and discovery. Learners are asked to accept these results as true for the purpose of applying them to various contextualised and abstract problems. They should come to appreciate that certain features of shapes or diagrams appear to be independent of the particular examples chosen. These apparently constant features or results can be established in a formal manner through logical proof. Even at the investigative stage, ideas involved in mathematical proof can be developed. Learners should become familiar with the formal proofs of the specified theorems (some of which are examinable at Higher level). Learners will be assessed by means of problems that can be solved using the theory.  As they engage with this strand and make connections across other strands, learners develop and reinforce their synthesis and problem-solving skills.At each syllabus level students should be able to:    explore patterns and formulate conjectures  explain findings  justify conclusions  communicate mathematics verbally and in written form  apply their knowledge and skills to solve problems in familiar and unfamiliar contexts  analyse information presented verbally and translate it into mathematical form  devise, select and use appropriate mathematical models, formulae or techniques to process information and to draw relevant conclusions. 6   Introduction   Geometry is the branch of mathematics dealing with geometrical shapes and space, whether 2-D or 3-D shapes. In the Leaving Certificate Ordinary Level Mathematics course it is divided into a number of different topics:   Synthetic Geometry: Traditionally this was known as Euclidean Geometry after the founder of this branch of geometry known as Euclid . It derives it's name from the fact that each of the theorems is built (or 'synthesized') from previous definitions, axioms and/or theorems.Synthetic geometry is important because it lays the groundwork for Co-ordinate geometry and Trigonometry.  Co-ordinate Geometry: Traditionally this was known as Cartesian Geometry , after the founder of this branch of geometry, René Descartes .  Constructions: This is the practical work in "doing Geometry".  Transformations and Enlargements: An extension of Co-ordinate Geometry. It has important applications in such areas as Computer Graphics and architecture.   Trigonometry is the study of the relationships between the sides and angles of a triangle. It has important applications in navigation, astronomy, Civil engineering, Electronic engineering etc.,  Synthetic geometry is important, mainly because it forms the theoretical foundations for Co-ordinate geometry and trigonometry.  Synthetic Geometry   Basic Concepts  The Plane  From the Junior certificate course,you will be aware that a point is normally defined using two co-ordinates, x and y.However, in order to plot these points, we need a surface on which to draw our point. The surface on which we draw the point is called a Plane . A plane is just a flat, 2-dimensional surface, such as the one shown below.You can consider it like the piece of paper on which you draw the point  (Figure)  Figure. A representation of a Plane   Points  A point is defined as a position on a plane, like the point P(x,y) shown above. A point is denoted by a capital letter and on the plane by a dot.  Points which lie on the same plane are said to be coplanar as in the figure shown below.  (Figure)  Figure. Two coplanar points      Lines  Having defined a point, we are now in a position to define what a line is. A line is an infinite series of points extending in both directions.   Note: As a result of this definition,since a line can be considered a series of points extending in both directions, if we know two points on the line, then in co-ordinate geometry,we can then name the line using these two points.       Perpendicular and Parallel lines  Having defined what a line is, we are now in a position to define two more types of lines in relation to the particular orientations these lines have in relation to other lines.   Two lines are parallel if they are an equal distance apart at every point. (According to the classical definition by Euclid, these lines will never meet. see Euclid's parallel postulate ).We denote this by a || b.  (Figure)  Two parallel lines   Two lines are perpendicular if they are at right angles to each other as shown below. We denote this by a ⊥ b.  (Figure)  Two perpendicular lines   Strand 3:Number  Strand 3 further develops the proficiency learners have gained through their study of strand 3 at junior cycle.Learners continue to make meaning of the operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication and division of whole and rational numbers and extend this sense-making to complex numbers.  They extend their work on proof and become more proficient at using algebraic notation and the laws of arithmetic and induction to show that something is always true. They utilise a number of tools: a sophisticated understanding of proportionality, rules of logarithms, rules of indices and 2D representations of 3D solids to solve single and multi-step problems in numerous contexts.  As they engage with this strand and make connections across other strands, learners develop and reinforce their synthesis and problem-solving skills.At each syllabus level students should be able to:    explore patterns and formulate conjectures  explain findings  justify conclusions  communicate mathematics verbally and in written form  apply their knowledge and skills to solve problems in familiar and unfamiliar contexts  analyse information presented verbally and translate it into mathematical form  devise, select and use appropriate mathematical models, formulae or techniques to process information and to draw relevant conclusions. 7   Number patterns       In the following section we will explore patterns between different sets of numbers and shapes and attempt to classify these patterns into a number of broad categories.  Sequence  A sequence is a succession of terms:      a  1   ,   a  2   ,   a  3   ,   …   a  n        subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2    subscript  a  3     normal-…   subscript  a  n      a_{1},a_{2},a_{3},...a_{n}    each of which is formed according to a definite rule which describes the underlying pattern, and is the same throughout the sequence.  Arithmetic sequences  An arithmetic sequence is a sequence in which each term differs from the previous term by adding or subtracting a constant number called the common difference .It has the general form:      a  ,   a  +  d   ,   a  +   2  d    ,   a  +   3  d    ,    …  a   +    (   n  -  1   )   d       a    a  d     a    2  d      a    3  d        normal-…  a       n  1   d      a,a+d,a+2d,a+3d,...a+(n-1)d      General(nth) Term of an arithmetic sequence  The nth term of an arithmetic sequence is found using the formula:       T  n   =   a  +    (   n  -  1   )   d         subscript  T  n     a      n  1   d      T_{n}=a+(n-1)d     where,    T  n     subscript  T  n    T_{n}   is the nth term,   a   a   a   is the first term in the sequence and,   d   d   d   is the common difference.   Example: The following is an arithmetic sequence:      1  4   ,   1  2   ,   3  4   ,  1  ,   5  4        1  4     1  2     3  4   1    5  4     \frac{1}{4},\frac{1}{2},\frac{3}{4},1,\frac{5}{4}     (a)Identify the first term, a , and the common difference, d , in the arithmetic sequence above.  (b)Using your answers from part(a) state what the general term is for this sequence  (c)Using the formula you worked out for the general term of this sequence in part(b), use it to calculatethe 100th term of this sequence.  Solution:  (a) The first term in the sequence is    1  4      1  4    \frac{1}{4}   , therefore    a  =   1  4       a    1  4     a=\frac{1}{4}   . The common difference can be found by subtracting a term in the sequence with the preceding term, for example      1  2   -   1  4    =   1  4           1  2     1  4      1  4     \frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{4}=\frac{1}{4}   , therefore,    d  =   1  4       d    1  4     d=\frac{1}{4}     (b)The General(or nth) term of the sequence is found using the formula:       T  n   =   a  +    (   n  -  1   )   d         subscript  T  n     a      n  1   d      T_{n}=a+(n-1)d     Substituting the values for a and d from part (a) into this formula we get:       T  n   =    1  4   +    (   n  -  1   )    1  4          subscript  T  n       1  4       n  1     1  4       T_{n}=\frac{1}{4}+(n-1)\frac{1}{4}          T  n   =     1  4   +    1  4   n    -   1  4         subscript  T  n         1  4       1  4   n      1  4      T_{n}=\frac{1}{4}+\frac{1}{4}n-\frac{1}{4}          T  n   =    1  4   n        subscript  T  n       1  4   n     T_{n}=\frac{1}{4}n      You can check your formula by calculating the third term to see if it is correct:       T  3   =    1  4    (  3  )         subscript  T  3       1  4   3     T_{3}=\frac{1}{4}(3)          T  3   =   3  4        subscript  T  3     3  4     T_{3}=\frac{3}{4}     (c)Using the formula worked out in part b, and n=100 we get:       T  100   =    1  4    (  100  )         subscript  T  100       1  4   100     T_{100}=\frac{1}{4}(100)                                       Complex Numbers   Introduction  In everyday language, the word "complex" is used to describe something which is complicated. However,when referring to complex numbers, the term simply refers to a number which consists of two separate parts as we will see.  Cartesian Complex numbers  If the quadratic equation      x  2   +   2  x   +  5   =  0         superscript  x  2     2  x   5   0    x^{2}+2x+5=0   is solved using the quadratic formula:      x  =     -  b   ±     b  2   -   4  a  c       2  a        x     plus-or-minus    b        superscript  b  2     4  a  c        2  a      x={-b\pm\sqrt{b^{2}-4ac}\over 2a}     then it will be seen that:      x  =     -  2   ±     2  2   -   4   (   1  x  5   )        2  x  1        x     plus-or-minus    2        superscript  2  2     4    1  x  5         2  x  1      x={-2\pm\sqrt{2^{2}-4(1x5)}\over 2x1}         x  =     -  2   ±    4  -   4   (  5  )       2       x     plus-or-minus    2       4    4  5      2     x={-2\pm\sqrt{4-4(5)}\over 2}         x  =     -  2   ±    4  -  20     2       x     plus-or-minus    2       4  20     2     x={-2\pm\sqrt{4-20}\over 2}         x  =     -  2   ±    -  16     2       x     plus-or-minus    2       16     2     x={-2\pm\sqrt{-16}\over 2}         x  =      -  2   ±   16    .    -  1     2       x     formulae-sequence   plus-or-minus    2     16        1     2     x={-2\pm\sqrt{16}.\sqrt{-1}\over 2}   [see rules of surds]      x  =     -  2   ±   4    -  1      2       x     plus-or-minus    2     4      1      2     x={-2\pm 4\sqrt{-1}\over 2}         x  =    -  1   ±   2    -  1          x   plus-or-minus    1     2      1        x={-1\pm 2\sqrt{-1}}     It is not possible to evaluate     -  1         1     \sqrt{-1}   in real terms. However, if an operator,   i   i   i   , is defined as:     i  =    -  1        i      1      i=\sqrt{-1}    then the solution may be expressed as    x  =    -  1   ±   2  i        x   plus-or-minus    1     2  i      x=-1\pm{2i}   , with   i   i   i   being the first letter of the word "imaginary", which brings us nicely to the definition of a complex number.  The two solutions of the quadratic equation above,     -  1   +   2  i         1     2  i     -1+2i   and     -  1   -   2  i         1     2  i     -1-2i   are known as complex numbers which have the form    a  +   b  i       a    b  i     a+bi   .As stated in the introduction a complex number consists of two parts: the   a   a   a   part is termed the real part as it is a real number and the    b  i      b  i    bi   part is termed the imaginary part.  Note:If you are asked for the imaginary part of a complex number, it is b, do not include the i, e.g if z=7-8i, the imaginary part, IM(z) is -8, not -8i.  Strand 4:Algebra  This strand builds on the relations-based approach of junior cycle where the five main objectives were:    to make use of letter symbols for numeric quantities  to emphasise relationship based algebra  to connect graphical and symbolic representations of algebraic concepts  to use real life problems as vehicles to motivate the use of algebra and algebraic thinking  to use appropriate graphing technologies (graphing calculators, computer software) throughout the strand activities.   Learners build on their proficiency in moving among equations, tables and graphs and become more adept at solving real-world problems.  As they engage with this strand and make connections across other strands, learners develop and reinforce their synthesis and problem-solving skills.At each syllabus level students should be able to:    explore patterns and formulate conjectures  explain findings  justify conclusions  communicate mathematics verbally and in written form  apply their knowledge and skills to solve problems in familiar and unfamiliar contexts  analyse information presented verbally and translate it into mathematical form  devise, select and use appropriate mathematical models, formulae or techniques to process information and to draw relevant conclusions.   Strand 5: Functions  This strand builds on the learners’ experience in junior cycle where they were formally introduced to the concept of a function as that which involves a set of inputs, a set of possible outputs and a rule that assigns one output to each input. The relationship between functions and algebra is further emphasised and learners continue to connect graphical and symbolic representations of functions. They are introduced to calculus as the study of how things change and use derivatives to solve various kinds of real-world problems. They learn how to go from the derivative of a function back to the function itself and use such methods to solve various geometric problems,such as computation of areas of specified regions.
