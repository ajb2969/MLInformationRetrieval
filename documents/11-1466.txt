Dephospho-CoA kinase

In enzymology, a dephospho-CoA kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + dephospho-CoA 
 
 
 
  ADP + CoA
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and dephospho-CoA, whereas its two products are ADP and CoA.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:dephospho-CoA 3'-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include dephosphocoenzyme A kinase (phosphorylating), 3'-dephospho-CoA kinase, and dephosphocoenzyme A kinase. This enzyme participates in pantothenate and coa biosynthesis.
