   Strömberg wavelet      Strömberg wavelet   In mathematics , the Strömberg wavelet is a certain orthonormal wavelet discovered by Jan-Olov Strömberg and presented in a paper published in 1983. 1 Even though the Haar wavelet was earlier known to be an orthonormal wavelet, Stromberg wavelet was the first smooth orthonormal wavelet to be discovered. The term wavelet had not been coined at the time of publishing the discovery of Strömberg wavelet and Strömberg's motivation was to find an orthonormal basis for the Hardy spaces . 2  Definition  Le m be any non-negative integer . Let V be any discrete subset of the set R of real numbers . Then V splits R into non-overlapping intervals . For any r in V , let I r denote the interval determined by V with r as the left endpoint. Let P ( m ) ( V ) denote the set of all functions  f ( t ) over R satisfying the following conditions:  :* f ( t ) is square integrable .  :* f ( t ) has continuous  derivatives of all orders up to m .  :* f ( t ) is a polynomial of degree m + 1 in each of the intervals I r . If A 0 = {. . . , -2, -3/2, -1, -1/2} ∪ {0} ∪ {1, 2, 3, . . .} and A 1 = A 0 ∪ { 1/2 } then the Strömberg wavelet of order m is a function S m ( t ) satisfying the following conditions: 3  :*       S  m    (  t  )    ∈    P   (  m  )     (   A  1   )     .         superscript  S  m   t      superscript  P  m    subscript  A  1      S^{m}(t)\in P^{(m)}(A_{1}).     :*     ∥    S  m    (  t  )    ∥   =  1       norm     superscript  S  m   t    1    \|S^{m}(t)\|=1   , that is,      ∫  R       |    S  m    (  t  )    |   2    d  t    =  1.        subscript   R      superscript       superscript  S  m   t    2   d  t    1.    \int_{R}|S^{m}(t)|^{2}\,dt=1.     :*     S  m    (  t  )        superscript  S  m   t    S^{m}(t)   is orthogonal to     P   (  m  )     (   A  0   )        superscript  P  m    subscript  A  0     P^{(m)}(A_{0})   , that is,      ∫  R     S  m    (  t  )   f   (  t  )   d  t    =  0        subscript   R      superscript  S  m   t  f  t  d  t    0    \int_{R}S^{m}(t)\,f(t)\,dt=0   for all      f   (  t  )    ∈    P   (  m  )     (   A  0   )     .        f  t      superscript  P  m    subscript  A  0      f(t)\in P^{(m)}(A_{0}).     Properties of the set P ( m ) ( V )  The following are some of the properties of the set P ( m ) ( V ):   Let the number of distinct elements in V be two. Then f ( t ) ∈ P ( m ) ( V ) if and only if f ( t ) = 0 for all t .  If the number of elements in V is three or more than P ( m ) ( V ) contains nonzero functions.  If V 1 and V 2 are discrete subsets of R such that V 1 ⊂ V 2 then P ( m ) ( V 1 ) ⊂ P ( m ) ( V 2 ). In particular, P ( m ) ( A 0 ) ⊂ P ( m ) ( A 1 ).  If f ( t ) ∈ P ( m ) ( A 1 ) then f ( t ) = g ( t ) + α λ( t ) where α is constant and g ( t ) ∈ P ( m ) ( A 0 ) is defined by g ( r ) = f ( r ) for r ∈ A 0 .   Strömberg wavelet as an orthonormal wavelet  The following result establishes the Strömberg wavelet as an orthonormal wavelet . 4  Theorem  Let S m be the Strömberg wavelet of order m . Then the following set        {    2   j  /  2     S  m    (     2  j   t   -  k   )    :   j  ,   k  integers    }     conditional-set     superscript  2    j  2     superscript  S  m        superscript  2  j   t   k     j    k  integers      \left\{2^{j/2}S^{m}(2^{j}t-k):j,k\text{ integers }\right\}        is a complete orthonormal system in the space of square integrable functions over R .  Stromberg wavelets of order 0  (Figure)  The graph of the Strömberg wavelet of order 0. The graph is scaled such that the value of the wavelet function at 1 is 1.   In the special case of Strömberg wavelets of order 0, the following facts may be observed:   If f ( t ) ∈ P 0 ( V ) then f ( t ) is defined uniquely by the discrete subset { f ( r ) : r ∈ V } of R .  To each s ∈ A 0 , a special function λ s in A 0 is associated: It is defined by λ s ( r ) = 1 if r = s and λ s ( r ) = 0 if s ≠ r ∈ A 0 . These special elements in P ( A 0 ) are called simple tents . The special simple tent λ 1/2 ( t ) is denoted by λ( t )   Computation of the Strömberg wavelet of order 0  As already observed, the Strömberg wavelet S 0 ( t ) is completely determined by the set { S 0 ( r ) : r ∈ A 1 }. Using the defining properties of the Strömbeg wavelet, exact expressions for elements of this set can be computed and they are given below. 5          S  0    (  k  )    =    S  0    (  1  )     (    3   -  2   )    k  -  1            superscript  S  0   k      superscript  S  0   1   superscript      3   2     k  1       S^{0}(k)=S^{0}(1)(\sqrt{3}-2)^{k-1}   for    k  =   1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  …       k   1  2  3  normal-…     k=1,2,3,\ldots           S  0    (   1  2   )    =   -    S  0    (  1  )    (    3   +   1  2    )            superscript  S  0     1  2         superscript  S  0   1      3     1  2        S^{0}(\tfrac{1}{2})=-S^{0}(1)\left(\sqrt{3}+\tfrac{1}{2}\right)           S  0    (  0  )    =    S  0    (  1  )    (    2   3    -  2   )           superscript  S  0   0      superscript  S  0   1      2    3    2      S^{0}(0)=S^{0}(1)(2\sqrt{3}-2)           S  0    (   -   k  2    )    =    S  0    (  1  )    (    2   3    -  2   )     (    3   -  2   )   k           superscript  S  0       k  2        superscript  S  0   1      2    3    2    superscript      3   2   k      S^{0}(-\tfrac{k}{2})=S^{0}(1)(2\sqrt{3}-2)(\sqrt{3}-2)^{k}   for    k  =   1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  …       k   1  2  3  normal-…     k=1,2,3,\ldots        Here S 0 (1) is constant such that || S 0 ( t )|| = 1.
