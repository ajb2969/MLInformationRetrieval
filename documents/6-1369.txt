Busemann function

Busemann functions were introduced by Busemann to study the large-scale geometry of metric spaces in his seminal The Geometry of Geodesics.1 More recently, Busemann functions have been used by probabilists to study asymptotic properties in models of first-passage percolation.23
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be a metric space. A ray is a path 
 
 
 
  which minimizes distance everywhere along its length. i.e., for all 
 
 
 
 ,


 
 . Equivalently, a ray is an isometry from the "canonical ray" (the set 
 
 
 
  equipped with the Euclidean metric) into the metric space X.
Given a ray γ, the Busemann function 
 
 
 
  is defined by


 
  That is, when t is very large, the distance 
 
 
 
  is approximately equal to 
 
 
 
 
 . Given a ray γ, its Busemann function is always well-defined.
Loosely speaking, a Busemann function can be thought of as a "distance to infinity" along the ray γ.
