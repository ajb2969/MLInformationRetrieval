   Busemann function      Busemann function   Busemann functions were introduced by Busemann to study the large-scale geometry of metric spaces in his seminal The Geometry of Geodesics . 1 More recently, Busemann functions have been used by probabilists to study asymptotic properties in models of first-passage percolation . 2 3  Definition  Let    (  X  ,  d  )     X  d    (X,d)   be a metric space . A ray is a path    γ  :    [  0  ,  ∞  )   →  X      normal-:  γ   normal-→   0    X     \gamma:[0,\infty)\to X   which minimizes distance everywhere along its length. i.e., for all     t  ,   t  ′    ∈   [  0  ,  ∞  )        t   superscript  t  normal-′     0      t,t^{\prime}\in[0,\infty)   ,       d   (   γ   (  t  )    ,   γ   (   t  ′   )    )    =   |   t  -   t  ′    |         d     γ  t     γ   superscript  t  normal-′          t   superscript  t  normal-′       d\big(\gamma(t),\gamma(t^{\prime})\big)=\big|t-t^{\prime}\big|   . Equivalently, a ray is an isometry from the "canonical ray" (the set    [  0  ,  ∞  )     0     [0,\infty)   equipped with the Euclidean metric) into the metric space X .  Given a ray γ , the Busemann function     B  γ   :   X  →  ℝ      normal-:   subscript  B  γ    normal-→  X  ℝ     B_{\gamma}:X\to\mathbb{R}   is defined by        B  γ    (  x  )    =    lim   t  →  ∞     (    d   (   γ   (  t  )    ,  x  )    -  t   )           subscript  B  γ   x     subscript    normal-→  t         d     γ  t   x    t      B_{\gamma}(x)=\lim_{t\to\infty}\big(d\big(\gamma(t),x\big)-t\big)   That is, when t is very large, the distance    d   (   γ   (  t  )    ,  x  )       d     γ  t   x     d\big(\gamma(t),x\big)   is approximately equal to      B  γ    (  x  )    +  t         subscript  B  γ   x   t    B_{\gamma}(x)+t   . Given a ray γ , its Busemann function is always well-defined.  Loosely speaking, a Busemann function can be thought of as a "distance to infinity" along the ray γ .
