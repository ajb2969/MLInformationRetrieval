   Strombine dehydrogenase      Strombine dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a strombine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-(carboxymethyl)-D-alanine + NAD + + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   glycine + pyruvate + NADH + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are N-(carboxymethyl)-D-alanine , NAD + , and H 2 O , whereas its 4 products are glycine , pyruvate , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-(carboxymethyl)-D-alanine:NAD+ oxidoreductase (glycine-forming) . Other names in common use include strombine[N-(carboxymethyl)-D-alanine]dehydrogenase , and N-(carboxymethyl)-D-alanine: NAD+ oxidoreductase .
