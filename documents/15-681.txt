Convergent matrix

In the mathematical discipline of numerical linear algebra, when successive powers of a matrix T become small (that is, when all of the entries of T approach zero, upon raising T to successive powers), the matrix T is called a convergent matrix. A regular splitting of a non-singular matrix A results in a convergent matrix T. A semi-convergent splitting of a matrix A results in a semi-convergent matrix T. A general iterative method converges for every initial vector if T is convergent, and under certain conditions if T is semi-convergent.
Definition
We call an n × n matrix T a convergent matrix if



for each i = 1, 2, ..., n and j = 1, 2, ..., n.123
Example
Let


 
 
  Computing successive powers of T, we obtain





 
 
  and, in general,


 
 
  Since


 
  and


T is a convergent matrix. Note that ρ(T) = 
 
 
 
 , where ρ(T) represents the spectral radius of T, since 
 
 
 
  is the only eigenvalue of T.
Characterizations
Let T be an n × n matrix. The following properties are equivalent to T being a convergent matrix:



 
  for some natural norm;


 
  for all natural norms;


 
 ;


 
  for every x.4567

Iterative methods
A general iterative method involves a process that converts the system of linear equations



into an equivalent system of the form



for some matrix T and vector c. After the initial vector x(0) is selected, the sequence of approximate solution vectors is generated by computing



for each k ≥ 0.89 For any initial vector x(0) ∈ 
 
 
 
 , the sequence 
 
 
 
  defined by (4), for each k ≥ 0 and c ≠ 0, converges to the unique solution of (3) if and only if ρ(T) 10
Regular splitting
A matrix splitting is an expression which represents a given matrix as a sum or difference of matrices. In the system of linear equations (2) above, with A non-singular, the matrix A can be split, i.e., written as a difference



so that (2) can be re-written as (4) above. The expression (5) is a regular splitting of A if and only if B−1 ≥ 0 and C ≥ 0, i.e., B−1 and C have only nonnegative entries. If the splitting (5) is a regular splitting of the matrix A and A−1 ≥ 0, then ρ(T) 11
Semi-convergent matrix
We call an n × n matrix T a semi-convergent matrix if the limit



exists.12 If A is possibly singular but (2) is consistent, i.e., b is in the range of A, then the sequence defined by (4) converges to a solution to (2) for every x(0) ∈ 
 
 
 
  if and only if T is semi-convergent. In this case, the splitting (5) is called a semi-convergent splitting of A.13
