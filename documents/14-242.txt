Voronoi pole

In geometry, the positive and negative Voronoi poles of a cell in a Voronoi diagram are certain vertices of the diagram.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
  be the Voronoi cell of the site 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is bounded then its positive pole is the Voronoi vertex in 
 
 
 
  with maximal distance to the sample point 
 
 
 
 . Furthermore, let 
 
 
 
  be the vector from 
 
 
 
  to the positive pole. If the cell is unbounded, then a positive pole is not defined, and 
 
 
 
  is defined to be a vector in the average direction of all unbounded Voronoi edges of the cell.
The negative pole is the Voronoi vertex 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  with the largest distance to 
 
 
 
  such that the vector 
 
 
 
  and the vector from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  make an angle larger than 
 
 
 
 .
Example

Example of poles in a Voronoi diagram

Here 
 
 
 
  is the positive pole of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  its negative. As the cell corresponding to 
 
 
 
  is unbounded only the negative pole 
 
 
 
  exists.
