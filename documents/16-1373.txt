   Draft:Multidimensional system simulation      Draft:Multidimensional system simulation    Introduction  Many problems are modeled as multidimensional systems , such as wave propagation or heat and mass transfer. More specifically, previous mentioned problems are dependent on both time and space. 1 In order to simulate those spatial-temporal systems, transfer function, initial and boundary conditions should be carefully formulated. In computer implementation, a suitable discrete system which closely preserves the behavior of continuous system is chosen. Different approaches are proposed to simulate the dynamic multidimensional system. 2 The following discussion is more focused on time and space dependent problems.  Problem Statement  General spatial-temporal systems  The time-space dependent multidimensional system $y ( \mathbf{ x } , t )$ could be represented by partial differential equations (PDE). 3  $\begin{align}\dot{y}(\textbf{x},t)+L\left\{y(\textbf{x},t)\right\} &= v(\textbf{x},t), \textbf{x}\in{\textbf{V}}\\
 y(\textbf{x},0)&={y}_{i}(\textbf{x}),\textbf{x}\in{\textbf{V}}\\
 {f}_{b}\left\{y(\textbf{x},t)\right\} &= \phi(\textbf{x},t),\textbf{x}\in{\textbf{S}}\end{align}$   $\mathbf{ x } $ is a vector in domain $V$ .  $L$ is a derivative operator of space or other physical effects.  $v ( \mathbf{ x } , t )$ is the excitation function.  is the initial value.  describes boundary conditions.  $Φ ( \mathbf{ x } , t )$ describes the boundary values.   Simple Example  The following 2-D system 4 could be used to describe heat transfer or mass diffusion process in one spatial dimension, with material constants $c$ and $λ$ .The boundary values and to zero.  $\begin{align}\dot{y}(x,t)+\frac{1}{c}\big(\lambda {y^\prime}(x,t)\big)^\prime &= 0, x_{0}\leq x \leq x_{1} \\
 y({x}_{0},t)&={y}_{b}(t)\\
 y({x}_{1},t)&=0\end{align}$  Note that if $c$ and $λ$ are functions of $y$ , then the system is nonlinear. We could still apply similar transformation methods to nonlinear system as in linear case 5 . This system is used in the demonstration of functional transformation method below.  Approaches  Conventional Approach  The conventional approach 6 to simulate multidimensional systems is intuitive. Using finite difference or finite element methods to obtain discrete time and space variables is the main idea. Usually iterative methods are used.This approach could be applied to either linear system or nonlinear system. The problem of the conventional approach is the computational cost. Since in each of iterations, considerable numbers of equations to be solved to resolve the nonlinearity in the system.  Signal Processing Approaches  Multidimensional wave-digital filters (MD WDFs)   Wave-digital principles , firstly developed to solve one-dimensional filtering problem, have been extended to multidimensional filtering applications.Common 2-D filters include fan filter,circular filter and etc.In the early days, the design of filters were based on physical concepts such as Kirchhoff circuit , wave quantities, energy and power, etc. Other than traditional filtering problem, the methods have also been found applicable to numerical integration of relevant ordinary and partial differential equations .  The major idea of MD WDFs method is modelling the physical system of interest with a discrete dynamical system, or MD WDFs specifically, preserving essential properties, passivity for instance, of the original system. In this case, the physical system must be known.The system could be linear or not. Instead of using PDEs to describe actual physical systems, we are using difference equations in several created independent variables, which limits the feasibility to apply this approach to general PDEs . Note that not all PDEs are relevant to physical systems.The limitation may or may not cause a problem in different cases.  The advantages of this approach are summarized below. Extended discussion could be found in the reference 7 .   Parallelism and locality  Numerical stability  Robustness  Variation of characteristic parameters and boundary shapes  Approximation in the spectral domain   Functional transformation  In order to reduce the computational cost and increase the feasibility in more general case, a new method is discussed in a paper 8 published in 1996.The functional transformation, more specifically mentioned as generalized Fourier or Sturm-Liouville transformation in the reference, is an approach to convert PDEs into a set of ODEs . Instead of computing PDEs , we could apply existing numerical methods, which are more efficient, to solve those derived ODEs . The original system then could be reconstructed from solved ODEs . Compared with the conventional approach, this method may takes $$ of the time 9 10 . The following equations is an implementation of this method on the simple example described in previous section.  To simplify the calculation, system equation is rewritten with $a = λ / c$ .  $\dot{y}(x,t)-ay^{\prime\prime}(x,t)=0, x_0 \leq x \leq x_1$  The first step is calculating the generalized Fourier transformation of simplified system:  $\begin{align}T\left\{y(x,t)\right\} &= \bar{y}(\beta_{\mu},t) = \int_{x_0}^{x_1}y(x,t)K(x,\beta_{\mu})dx\\
 K(x,\beta_{\mu})&=sin(\beta_{\mu}(x-x_0)/\sqrt{a}),\beta_{\mu}=\frac{(\mu-1)\pi}{x_1-x_0}\sqrt{a},\mu \in N\end{align}$  Here is a specially picked transformation kernel to yield the differentiation theorem .  $T\left\{y^{\prime\prime}(x,t)\right\}=\frac{\beta_{\mu}}{\sqrt{a}}y_b(t)-\frac{\beta_{\mu}^2}{a}\bar{y}(\beta_{\mu},t)$  Note that is one boundary condition. Applying both functional transformation and differentiation theorem , we can obtain the desired ODEs , which could be solved with numerical approaches.  $\dot{\bar{y}}(\beta_{\mu},t)=-\beta_{\mu}^2\bar{y}(\beta_{\mu},t)+\sqrt{a}\beta_{\mu}y_b(t)=f(\bar{y},y_b)$  This equation can be solved numerically at discrete times for a finite number of spectral components . The last step is to recover $y ( x , t )$ from solved ODEs .  $T^{-1}\left\{\bar{y}(\beta_{\mu},t)\right\}=y(x,t)=\sum_{\mu=1}^{\infty}\frac{1}{N_{\mu}}\bar{y}(\beta_{\mu},t)K(x,\beta_{\mu})$  Note that we obtained the previous equation by using the orthogonality of the kernel .Same approach could be done in different applications. As mentioned before, this approach will work on nonlinear systems. Readers may check the paper 11 for more detailed discussion and further information.  References  "     ↩  ↩      ↩    ↩
