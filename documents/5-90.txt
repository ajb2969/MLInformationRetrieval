   Discount function      Discount function   A discount function is used in economic models to describe the weights placed on rewards received at different points in time. For example, if time is discrete and utility is time-separable, with the discount function      f   (  t  )       f  t    f(t)   and with    c   (  t  )       c  t    c(t)   defined as consumption at time t,  total utility is given by       U   (    {   c  t   }    t  =  0   ∞   )    =    ∑   t  =  0   ∞    f   (  t  )   u   (   c  t   )           U   superscript   subscript    subscript  c  t      t  0         superscript   subscript     t  0        f  t  u   subscript  c  t       U(\{c_{t}\}_{t=0}^{\infty})=\sum_{t=0}^{\infty}{f(t)u(c_{t})}   .  Total utility in the continuous-time case is given by       U   (    {   c   (  t  )    }    t  =  0   ∞   )    =    ∫  0  ∞    f   (  t  )   u   (   c   (  t  )    )   d  t          U   superscript   subscript     c  t      t  0         superscript   subscript   0       f  t  u    c  t   d  t      U(\{c(t)\}_{t=0}^{\infty})=\int_{0}^{\infty}{f(t)u(c(t))dt}     provided that this integral exists.  Exponential discounting and hyperbolic discounting are the two most commonly used examples.
