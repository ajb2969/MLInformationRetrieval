Xylono-1,4-lactonase




Xylono-1,4-lactonase

In enzymology, a xylono-1,4-lactonase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-xylono-1,4-lactone + H2O 
 
 
 
  D-xylonate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-xylono-1,4-lactone and H2O, whereas its product is D-xylonate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on carboxylic ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-xylono-1,4-lactone lactonohydrolase. Other names in common use include xylono-g-lactonase, and xylonolactonase. This enzyme participates in pentose and glucuronate interconversions.
