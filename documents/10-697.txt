   (+)-sabinol dehydrogenase      (+)-sabinol dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a (+)-sabinol dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (+)-cis-sabinol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (+)-sabinone + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (+)-cis-sabinol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are (+)-sabinone , NADH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (+)-cis-sabinol:NAD + oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called (+)-cis-sabinol dehydrogenase .
