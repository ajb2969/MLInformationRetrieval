Luttinger parameter

In semiconductors, valence bands are well characterized by 3 Luttinger parameters. At the Г-point in the band structure, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  orbitals form valence bands. But spin-orbit coupling splits sixfold degeneracy into high energy 4-fold and lower energy 2-fold bands. Again 4-fold degeneracy is lifted into heavy- and light hole bands by phenomenological Hamiltonian by J. M. Luttinger.
Three valence band state
In the presence of spin-orbit interaction, total angular momentum should take part in. From the three valence band, l=1 and s=1/2 state generate six state of |j,mj> as 
 
 

The spin-orbit interaction from the relativistic quantum mechanics, lowers the energy of j=1/2 states down.
==Phenomenological Hamiltonian for the j=3/2 states== Phenomenological Hamiltonian in spherical approximation is written as1


Phenomenological Luttinger parameters 
 
 
 
  are defined as



and



If we take 
 
 
 
  as 
 
 
 
 
 , the Hamiltonian is diagonalized for j=3/2 states.

Measurement of Luttinger parameters
Luttinger parameter can be measured by Hot-electron luminescence experiment.
Example: GaAs
