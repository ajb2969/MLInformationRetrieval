   Artin conductor      Artin conductor   In mathematics , the Artin conductor is a number or ideal associated to a character of a Galois group of a local or global  field , introduced by  as an expression appearing in the functional equation of an Artin L-function .  Local Artin conductors  Suppose that L is a finite Galois extension of the local field K , with Galois group G . If œá is a character of G , then the Artin conductor of œá is the number       f   (  œá  )    =    ‚àë   i  ‚â•  0       g  i    g  0     (    œá   (  1  )    -   œá   (   G  i   )     )           f  œá     subscript     i  0         subscript  g  i    subscript  g  0        œá  1     œá   subscript  G  i         f(\chi)=\sum_{i\geq 0}\frac{g_{i}}{g_{0}}(\chi(1)-\chi(G_{i}))   where G i is the i -th ramification group (in lower numbering ), of order g i , and œá( G i ) is the average value of œá on G i . 1 By a result of Artin, the local conductor is an integer. 2 3 If œá is unramified, then its Artin conductor is zero. If L is unramified over K , then the Artin conductors of all œá are zero.  The wild invariant 4 or Swan conductor 5 of the character is        f   (  œá  )    -   (    œá   (  1  )    -   œá   (   G  0   )     )    ,        f  œá       œá  1     œá   subscript  G  0       f(\chi)-(\chi(1)-\chi(G_{0})),     in other words, the sum of the higher order terms with i > 0.  Global Artin conductors  The global Artin conductor of a representation œá of the Galois group G of a finite extension L / K of global fields is an ideal of K , defined to be       ùî£   (  œá  )    =    ‚àè  p    p   f   (  œá  ,  p  )            ùî£  œá     subscript  product  p    superscript  p    f   œá  p        \mathfrak{f}(\chi)=\prod_{p}p^{f(\chi,p)}     where the product is over the primes p of K , and f (œá, p ) is the local Artin conductor of the restriction of œá to the decomposition group of some prime of L lying over p . 6 Since the local Artin conductor is zero at unramified primes, the above product only need be taken over primes that ramify in L / K .  Artin representation and Artin character  Suppose that L is a finite Galois extension of the local field K , with Galois group G . The Artin character  a G of G is the character       a  G   =    ‚àë  œá    f   (  œá  )   œá         subscript  a  G     subscript   œá     f  œá  œá      a_{G}=\sum_{\chi}f(\chi)\chi     and the Artin representation  A G is the complex linear representation of G with this character.  asked for a direct construction of the Artin representation.  showed that the Artin representation can be realized over the local field Q l , for any prime l not equal to the residue characteristic p .  showed that it can be realized over the corresponding ring of Witt vectors. It cannot in general be realized over the rationals or over the local field Q p , suggesting that there is no easy way to construct the Artin representation explicitly. 7  Swan representation  The Swan character sw G is given by       s   w  G    =     a  G   -   r  G    +   1          s   subscript  w  G         subscript  a  G    subscript  r  G    1     sw_{G}=a_{G}-r_{G}+1\,     where r g is the character of the regular representation and 1 is the character of the trivial representation. 8 The Swan character is the character of a representation of G .  showed that there is a unique projective representation of G over the l -adic integers with character the Swan character.  Applications  The Artin conductor appears in the conductor-discriminant formula for the discriminant of a global field. 9  The optimal level in the Serre modularity conjecture is expressed in terms of the Artin conductor.  The Artin conductor appears in the functional equation of the Artin L-function .  The Artin and Swan representations are used to defined the conductor of an elliptic curve or abelian variety.
