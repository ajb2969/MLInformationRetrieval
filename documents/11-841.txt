   Acyl-(acyl-carrier-protein)—UDP-N-acetylglucosamine O-acyltransferase      Acyl-(acyl-carrier-protein)—UDP-N-acetylglucosamine O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , an acyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]-UDP-N-acetylglucosamine O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein] + UDP-N-acetylglucosamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   [acyl-carrier-protein] + UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl- acyl-carrier-protein and UDP-N-acetylglucosamine , whereas its two products are acyl-carrier-protein and UDP-3-O-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)-N-acetylglucosamine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-3-hydroxytetradecanoyl-[acyl-carrier-protein]:UDP-N-acetylglucosamine 3-O-(3-hydroxytetradecanoyl)transferase . Other names in common use include UDP-N-acetylglucosamine acyltransferase and uridine diphosphoacetylglucosamine acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
