NADH kinase




NADH kinase

In enzymology, a NADH kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + NADH 
 
 
 
  ADP + NADPH
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and NADH, whereas its two products are ADP and NADPH.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:NADH 2'-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide kinase (phosphorylating), DPNH kinase, reduced diphosphopyridine nucleotide kinase, and NADH kinase. This enzyme has at least one activator, acetate.1
