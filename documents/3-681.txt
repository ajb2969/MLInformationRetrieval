Airy function

In the physical sciences, the Airy function Ai(x) is a special function named after the British astronomer George Biddell Airy (1801–92). The function Ai(x) and the related function Bi(x), which is also called the Airy function, but sometimes referred to as the Bairy function, are solutions to the differential equation



known as the Airy equation or the Stokes equation. This is the simplest second-order linear differential equation with a turning point (a point where the character of the solutions changes from oscillatory to exponential).
The Airy function is the solution to Schrödinger's equation for a particle confined within a triangular potential well and for a particle in a one-dimensional constant force field. For the same reason, it also serves to provide uniform semiclassical approximations near a turning point in the WKB approximation, when the potential may be locally approximated by a linear function of position. The triangular potential well solution is directly relevant for the understanding of many semiconductor devices.
The Airy function also underlies the form of the intensity near an optical directional caustic, such as that of the rainbow. Historically, this was the mathematical problem that led Airy to develop this special function. The Airy function is also important in microscopy and astronomy; it describes the pattern, due to diffraction and interference, produced by a point source of light (one of which is smaller than the resolution limit of a microscope or telescope).
Definitions
 For real values of x, the Airy function of the first kind can be defined by the improper Riemann integral:


 
  which converges because the positive and negative parts of the rapid oscillations tend to cancel one another out (as can be checked by integration by parts).
y = Ai(x) satisfies the Airy equation


 
  This equation has two linearly independent solutions. Up to scalar multiplication, Ai(x) is the solution subject to the condition y → 0 as x → ∞. The standard choice for the other solution is the Airy function of the second kind, denoted Bi(x). It is defined as the solution with the same amplitude of oscillation as Ai(x) as x → −∞ which differs in phase by π/2:



Properties
The values of Ai(x) and Bi(x) and their derivatives at x = 0 are given by


 
 
  Here, Γ denotes the Gamma function. It follows that the Wronskian of Ai(x) and Bi(x) is 1/π.
When x is positive, Ai(x) is positive, convex, and decreasing exponentially to zero, while Bi(x) is positive, convex, and increasing exponentially. When x is negative, Ai(x) and Bi(x) oscillate around zero with ever-increasing frequency and ever-decreasing amplitude. This is supported by the asymptotic formulae below for the Airy functions.
The Airy functions are orthogonal1 in the sense that

Asymptotic formulae
  As explained below, the Airy functions can be extended to the complex plane, giving entire functions. The asymptotic behaviour of the Airy functions as |z| goes to infinity at a constant value of arg(z) depends on arg(z): this is called the Stokes phenomenon. For |arg(z)| , Eqns 10.4.59 and 10.4.63


 
  and a similar one for Bi(z), but only applicable when |arg(z)| \mathrm{Bi}(z)\sim \frac{e^{\frac{2}{3}z^{\frac{3}{2}}}}{\sqrt\pi\,z^{\frac{1}{4}}}\left[ \sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{ \Gamma(n+\frac{5}{6})\Gamma(n+\frac{1}{6})\left(\frac{3}{4}\right)^n}{2\pi n! z^{3n/2}} \right].

When |arg(z)| = 0 these are good approximations but are not asymptotic because the ratio between Ai(−z) or Bi(−z) and the above approximation goes to infinity whenever the sine or cosine goes to zero. Asymptotic expansions for these limits are also available. These are listed in (Abramowitz and Stegun, 1954) and (Olver, 1974).
Complex arguments
We can extend the definition of the Airy function to the complex plane by


 
  where the integral is over a path C starting at the point at infinity with argument −π/2 and ending at the point at infinity with argument π/2. Alternatively, we can use the differential equation y′′ − xy = 0 to extend Ai(x) and Bi(x) to entire functions on the complex plane.
The asymptotic formula for Ai(x) is still valid in the complex plane if the principal value of x2/3 is taken and x is bounded away from the negative real axis. The formula for Bi(x) is valid provided x is in the sector {x ∈ C : |arg(x)| \Re \left[ \mathrm{Ai} ( x + iy) \right]  !

Relation to other special functions
For positive arguments, the Airy functions are related to the modified Bessel functions:


 
 
  Here, I±1/3 and K1/3 are solutions of



The first derivative of Airy function is



Functions K1/3 and K2/3 can be represented in terms of rapidly converged integrals2 (see also modified Bessel functions )
For negative arguments, the Airy function are related to the Bessel functions:


 
 
  Here, J±1/3 are solutions of



The Scorer's functions solve the equation y′′ − xy = 1/π. They can also be expressed in terms of the Airy functions:

History
The Airy function is named after the British astronomer and physicist George Biddell Airy (1801–1892), who encountered it in his early study of optics in physics (Airy 1838). The notation Ai(x) was introduced by Harold Jeffreys. Airy had become the British Astronomer Royal in 1835, and he held that post until his retirement in 1881.
