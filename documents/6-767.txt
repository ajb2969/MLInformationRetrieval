   Schottky effect      Schottky effect   The Schottky effect or field enhanced thermionic emission is a phenomenon in condensed matter physics named after Walter H. Schottky . In electron emission devices, especially electron guns , the thermionic electron emitter will be biased negative relative to its surroundings. This creates an electric field of magnitude F at the emitter surface. Without the field, the surface barrier seen by an escaping Fermi-level electron has height W equal to the local work-function. The electric field lowers the surface barrier by an amount Δ W , and increases the emission current. It can be modeled by a simple modification of the Richardson equation , by replacing W by ( W − Δ W ). This gives the equation 1 2       J   (  F  ,  T  ,  W  )    =    A  G    T  2    e    -   (   W  -   Δ  W    )     k  T            J   F  T  W       subscript  A  normal-G    superscript  T  2    superscript  e        W    normal-Δ  W       k  T        J(F,T,W)=A_{\mathrm{G}}T^{2}e^{-(W-\Delta W)\over kT}           Δ  W   =      e  3   F    4  π   ϵ  0       ,        normal-Δ  W          superscript  e  3   F     4  π   subscript  ϵ  0        \Delta W=\sqrt{e^{3}F\over 4\pi\epsilon_{0}},   where ε 0 is the electric constant (also, formerly, called the vacuum permittivity ).  Electron emission that takes place in the field-and-temperature-regime where this modified equation applies is often called Schottky emission . This equation is relatively accurate for electric field strengths lower than about 10 8 V  m −1 . For electric field strengths higher than 10 8 V m −1 , so-called Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling begins to contribute significant emission current. In this regime, the combined effects of field-enhanced thermionic and field emission can be modeled by the Murphy-Good equation for thermo-field (T-F) emission. 3 At even higher fields, FN tunneling becomes the dominant electron emission mechanism, and the emitter operates in the so-called "cold field electron emission (CFE)" regime.  Thermionic emission can also be enhanced by interaction with other forms of excitation such as light. 4 For example, excited Cs-vapours in thermionic converters form clusters of Cs- Rydberg matter which yield a decrease of collector emitting work function from 1.5 eV to 1.0–0.7 eV. Due to long-lived nature of Rydberg matter this low work function remains low which essentially increases the low-temperature converter’s efficiency. 5  See also   Thermionic emission   References  "  Category:Condensed matter physics  Category:Electron beam     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
