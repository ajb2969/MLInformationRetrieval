   Shearlet      Shearlet   In applied mathematical analysis, shearlets are a multiscale framework which allows to efficiently encode anisotropic features in multivariate problem classes. Originally, shearlets were introduced in 2006 1 for the analysis as well as sparse approximation of functions    f  ∈    L  2    (    \R   2   )        f     superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2      f\in L^{2}(\R^{2})   . They are a natural extension of wavelets to accommodate the fact that multivariate functions are typically governed by anisotropic features such as edges in images, however, wavelets as isotropic objects are not capable of capturing such phenomena.  Shearlets are constructed by parabolic scaling , shearing and translation applied to few generating functions. At fine scales, they are essentially supported within skinny and directional ridges following the parabolic scaling law, which reads length² ≈ width . Similar to wavelets, shearlets arise from the affine group and allow a unified treatment of the continuum and digital situation leading to faithful implementations. Although they do not constitute an orthonormal basis for     L  2    (    \R   2   )        superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2     L^{2}(\R^{2})   , they still form a frame allowing stable expansions of arbitrary functions    f  ∈    L  2    (    \R   2   )        f     superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2      f\in L^{2}(\R^{2})   .  One of the most important properties of shearlets is the fact that they provide optimally sparse approximations (in the sense of optimality in 2 ) for cartoon-like functions    f   f   f   . In imaging sciences, cartoon-like functions serve as a model for anisotropic features and are compactly supported in     [  0  ,  1  ]   2     superscript   0  1   2    [0,1]^{2}   while being    C  2     superscript  C  2    C^{2}   apart from a closed piecewise    C  2     superscript  C  2    C^{2}   singularity curve with bounded curvature. The decay rate of the    L  2     superscript  L  2    L^{2}   -error of the   N   N   N   -term shearlet approximation obtained by taking the   N   N   N   largest coefficients from the shearlet expansion is in fact optimal up to a log-factor: 3 4          ∥   f  -   f  N    ∥    L  2   2   ≤   C   N   -  2      (   log  N   )   3     ,   N  →  ∞    ,     formulae-sequence     superscript   subscript   norm    f   subscript  f  N      superscript  L  2    2     C   superscript  N    2     superscript    N   3      normal-→  N      \|f-f_{N}\|_{L^{2}}^{2}\leq CN^{-2}(\log N)^{3},\quad N\to\infty,   where the constant   C   C   C   depends only on the maximum curvature of the singularity curve and the maximum magnitudes of   f   f   f   ,    f    ′      superscript  f   normal-′     f^{{}^{\prime}}   and    f    ′′      superscript  f   ′′     f^{{}^{\prime\prime}}   . This approximation rate significantly improves the best   N   N   N   -term approximation rate of wavelets providing only    O   (   N   -  1    )       O   superscript  N    1      O(N^{-1})   for such class of functions.  Shearlets are to date the only directional representation system which provides sparse approximation of anisotropic features while providing a unified treatment of the continuum and digital realm in the sense of allowing faithful implementation. Extensions of shearlet systems to       L  2    (    \R   d   )    ,  d   ≥  2          superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  d    d   2    L^{2}(\R^{d}),d\geq 2   are also available. A comprehensive presentation of the theory and applications of shearlets can be found in: 5  Definition  Continuous shearlet systems  The construction of continuous shearlet systems is based on parabolic scaling matrices        A  a   =   [     a    0      0     a   1  /  2       ]    ,   a  >  0      formulae-sequence     subscript  A  a     a  0    0   superscript  a    1  2         a  0     A_{a}=\begin{bmatrix}a&0\\
 0&a^{1/2}\end{bmatrix},\quad a>0     as a mean to change the resolution, on shear matrices        S  s   =   [     1    s      0    1     ]    ,   s  ∈   \R       formulae-sequence     subscript  S  s     1  s    0  1       s  \R     S_{s}=\begin{bmatrix}1&s\\
 0&1\end{bmatrix},\quad s\in\R     as a means to change the orientation, and finally on translations to change the positioning. In comparison to curvelets , shearlets use shearings instead of rotations, the advantage being that the shear operator    S  s     subscript  S  s    S_{s}   leaves the integer lattice invariant in case    s  ∈   \Z       s  \Z    s\in\Z   , i.e.,       S  s     \Z   2    ⊆    \Z   2    .         subscript  S  s    superscript  \Z  2     superscript  \Z  2     S_{s}\Z^{2}\subseteq\Z^{2}.   This indeed allows a unified treatment of the continuum and digital realm, thereby guaranteeing a faithful digital implementation.

 ^{2}(\R^{2}),\quad(a,s,t)\in\R_{>0}\times\R\times\R^{2}.     Discrete shearlet systems  A discrete version of shearlet systems can be directly obtained from     SH  cont    (  ψ  )       subscript  SH  cont   ψ    \operatorname{SH}_{\mathrm{cont}}(\psi)   by discretizing the parameter set       \R     >  0    ×   \R   ×    \R   2    .       subscript  \R    absent  0    \R   superscript  \R  2     \R_{>0}\times\R\times\R^{2}.   There are numerous approaches for this but the most popular one is given by        {   (   2  j   ,  k  ,    A   2  j    -  1     S  k   -  1    m   )   ∣    j  ∈   \Z    ,    k  ∈   \Z    ,   m  ∈    \Z   2      }   ⊆     \R     >  0    ×   \R   ×    \R   2     .       conditional-set    superscript  2  j   k     superscript   subscript  A   superscript  2  j      1     superscript   subscript  S  k     1    m     formulae-sequence    j  \Z    formulae-sequence    k  \Z     m   superscript  \Z  2          subscript  \R    absent  0    \R   superscript  \R  2      \{(2^{j},k,A_{2^{j}}^{-1}S_{k}^{-1}m)\mid j\in\Z,k\in\Z,m\in\Z^{2}\}\subseteq%

From this, the discrete shearlet system associated with the shearlet generator   ψ   ψ   \psi   is defined by      SH   (  ψ  )   =   {   ψ   j  ,  k  ,  m    =   2    3  j   /  4    ψ   (   S  k    A   2  j    ⋅  -  m  )   ∣  j  ∈   \Z   ,  k  ∈   \Z   ,  m  ∈    \Z   2   }   ,     fragments  SH   fragments  normal-(  ψ  normal-)     fragments  normal-{   subscript  ψ   j  k  m      superscript  2      3  j   4    ψ   fragments  normal-(   subscript  S  k    subscript  A   superscript  2  j    normal-⋅   m  normal-)   normal-∣  j   \Z  normal-,  k   \Z  normal-,  m    superscript  \Z  2   normal-}   normal-,    \operatorname{SH}(\psi)=\{\psi_{j,k,m}=2^{3j/4}\psi(S_{k}A_{2^{j}}\cdot{}-m)%

Examples  Let     ψ  1   ∈    L  2    (   \R   )         subscript  ψ  1      superscript  L  2   \R     \psi_{1}\in L^{2}(\R)   be a function satisfying the discrete Calderón condition , i.e.,          ∑   j  ∈   \Z       |     ψ  ^   1    (    2   -  j    ξ   )    |   2    =  1   ,   ξ  ∈   \R     ,     formulae-sequence      subscript     j  \Z     superscript       subscript   normal-^  ψ   1      superscript  2    j    ξ     2    1     ξ  \R     \sum_{j\in\Z}|\hat{\psi}_{1}(2^{-j}\xi)|^{2}=1,\quad\xi\in\R,     with      ψ  ^   1   ∈    C  ∞    (   \R   )         subscript   normal-^  ψ   1      superscript  C    \R     \hat{\psi}_{1}\in C^{\infty}(\R)   and      supp    ψ  ^   1    ⊆    [   -   1  2    ,   -   1  16    ]   ∪   [   1  16   ,   1  2   ]     ,       supp   subscript   normal-^  ψ   1           1  2        1  16        1  16     1  2       \operatorname{supp}\hat{\psi}_{1}\subseteq[-\tfrac{1}{2},-\tfrac{1}{16}]\cup[%
 \tfrac{1}{16},\tfrac{1}{2}],   where     ψ  ^   1     subscript   normal-^  ψ   1    \hat{\psi}_{1}   denotes the Fourier transform of     ψ  1   .     subscript  ψ  1    \psi_{1}.   For instance, one can choose    ψ  1     subscript  ψ  1    \psi_{1}   to be a Meyer wavelet . Furthermore, let     ψ  2   ∈    L  2    (   \R   )         subscript  ψ  2      superscript  L  2   \R     \psi_{2}\in L^{2}(\R)   be such that       ψ  ^   2   ∈    C  ∞    (   \R   )     ,       subscript   normal-^  ψ   2      superscript  C    \R     \hat{\psi}_{2}\in C^{\infty}(\R),        supp    ψ  ^   2    ⊆   [   -  1   ,  1  ]        supp   subscript   normal-^  ψ   2       1   1     \operatorname{supp}\hat{\psi}_{2}\subseteq[-1,1]   and          ∑   k  ∈  Z      |     ψ  ^   2    (   ξ  +  k   )    |   2    =  1   ,   ξ  ∈   \R     .     formulae-sequence      subscript     k  Z     superscript       subscript   normal-^  ψ   2     ξ  k     2    1     ξ  \R     \sum_{k\in Z}|\hat{\psi}_{2}(\xi+k)|^{2}=1,\quad\xi\in\R.     One typically chooses     ψ  ^   2     subscript   normal-^  ψ   2    \hat{\psi}_{2}   to be a smooth bump function . Then    ψ  ∈    L  2    (    \R   2   )        ψ     superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2      \psi\in L^{2}(\R^{2})   given by          ψ  ^    (  ξ  )    =     ψ  ^   1    (   ξ  1   )     ψ  ^   2    (     ξ  2    ξ  1     )     ,   ξ  =   (   ξ  1   ,   ξ  2   )   ∈    \R   2     ,     formulae-sequence       normal-^  ψ   ξ      subscript   normal-^  ψ   1    subscript  ξ  1    subscript   normal-^  ψ   2      subscript  ξ  2    subscript  ξ  1          ξ    subscript  ξ  1    subscript  ξ  2          superscript  \R  2       \hat{\psi}(\xi)=\hat{\psi}_{1}(\xi_{1})\hat{\psi}_{2}\left(\tfrac{\xi_{2}}{\xi%
 _{1}}\right),\quad\xi=(\xi_{1},\xi_{2})\in\R^{2},     is called a classical shearlet . It can be shown that the corresponding discrete shearlet system    SH   (  ψ  )      SH  ψ    \operatorname{SH}(\psi)   constitutes a Parseval frame for     L  2    (    \R   2   )        superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2     L^{2}(\R^{2})   consisting of bandlimited functions. 6  Another example are compactly  supported shearlet systems, where a compactly supported function    ψ  ∈    L  2    (    \R   2   )        ψ     superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2      \psi\in L^{2}(\R^{2})   can be chosen so that    SH   (  ψ  )      SH  ψ    \operatorname{SH}(\psi)   forms a frame for     L  2    (    \R   2   )        superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2     L^{2}(\R^{2})   . 7 8 9 10 In this case, all shearlet elements in    SH   (  ψ  )      SH  ψ    \operatorname{SH}(\psi)   are compactly supported providing superior spatial localization compared to the classical shearlets, which are bandlimited. Although a compactly supported shearlet system does not generally form a Parseval frame, any function    f  ∈    L  2    (    \R   2   )        f     superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2      f\in L^{2}(\R^{2})   can be represented by the shearlet expansion due to its frame property.  Cone-adapted shearlets  One drawback of shearlets defined as above is the directional bias of shearlet elements associated with large shearing parameters. This effect is already recognizable in the frequency tiling of classical shearlets (see Figure in Section #Examples ), where the frequency support of a shearlet increasingly aligns along the    ξ  2     subscript  ξ  2    \xi_{2}   -axis as the shearing parameter   s   s   s   goes to infinity. This causes serious problems when analyzing a function whose Fourier transform is concentrated around the    ξ  2     subscript  ξ  2    \xi_{2}   -axis.  To deal with this problem, the frequency domain is divided into a low-frequency part and two conic regions (see Figure):     ℛ   ℛ   \displaystyle\mathcal{R}     The associated cone-adapted discrete shearlet system consists of three parts, each one corresponding to one of these frequency domains. It is generated by three functions     ϕ  ,  ψ  ,   ψ  ~    ∈    L  2    (    \R   2   )         ϕ  ψ   normal-~  ψ       superscript  L  2    superscript  \R  2      \phi,\psi,\tilde{\psi}\in L^{2}(\R^{2})   and a lattice sampling factor     c  =   (   c  1   ,   c  2   )   ∈    (    \R     >  0    )   2    :      normal-:      c    subscript  c  1    subscript  c  2          superscript   subscript  \R    absent  0    2     absent    c=(c_{1},c_{2})\in(\R_{>0})^{2}:           SH   (  ϕ  ,  ψ  ,   ψ  ~   ;  c  )    =    Φ   (  ϕ  ;   c  1   )    ∪   Ψ   (  ψ  ;  c  )    ∪    Ψ  ~    (   ψ  ~   ;  c  )      ,       SH  ϕ  ψ   normal-~  ψ   c       normal-Φ   ϕ   subscript  c  1       normal-Ψ   ψ  c       normal-~  normal-Ψ     normal-~  ψ   c       \operatorname{SH}(\phi,\psi,\tilde{\psi};c)=\Phi(\phi;c_{1})\cup\Psi(\psi;c)%

Thus, they correspond to the conic regions    𝒞  h     subscript  𝒞  normal-h    \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{h}}   and    𝒞  v     subscript  𝒞  normal-v    \mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{v}}   , respectively.
