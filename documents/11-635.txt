Quercitrinase

In enzymology, a quercitrinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

quercitrin + H2O 
 
 
 
  L-rhamnose + quercetin
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are quercitrin and H2O, whereas its two products are L-rhamnose and quercetin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those glycosidases that hydrolyse O- and S-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is quercitrin 3-L-rhamnohydrolase.
The enzyme can be found in Aspergillus flavus.1 It is an enzyme in the rutin catabolic pathway.2
