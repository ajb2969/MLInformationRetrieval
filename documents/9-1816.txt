(Thus a segment joining two vertices while passing through the interior or exterior is not an edge but instead is called a diagonal .) In a polyhedron or more generally a polytope, an edge is a line segment where two two-dimensional faces meet. 3  Relation to edges in graphs  In graph theory , an edge is an abstract object connecting two graph vertices , unlike polygon and polyhedron edges which have a concrete geometric representation as a line segment. However, any polyhedron can be represented by its skeleton or edge-skeleton, a graph whose vertices are the geometric vertices of the polyhedron and whose edges correspond to the geometric edges. 4 Conversely, the graphs that are skeletons of three-dimensional polyhedra can be characterized by Steinitz's theorem as being exactly the 3-vertex-connected  planar graphs . 5  Number of edges in a polyhedron  Any convex polyhedron 's surface has Euler characteristic         V  -  E   +  F   =  2   ,          V  E   F   2    V-E+F=2,     where V is the number of vertices , E is the number of edges, and F is the number of faces . This equation is known as Euler's polyhedron formula . Thus the number of edges is 2 less than the sum of the numbers of vertices and faces. For example, a cube has 8 vertices and 6 faces, and hence 12 edges.  Incidences with other faces  In a polygon, two edges meet at each vertex; more generally, by Balinski's theorem , at least d edges meet at every vertex of a d -dimensional convex polytope. 6 Similarly, in a polyhedron, exactly two two-dimensional faces meet at every edge, 7 while in higher dimensional polytopes three or more two-dimensional faces meet at every edge.  Alternative terminology  In the theory of high-dimensional convex polytopes , a facet or side of a d -dimensional polytope is one of its ( d − 1)-dimensional features, a ridge is a ( d − 2)-dimensional feature, and a peak is a ( d − 3)-dimensional feature. Thus, the edges of a polygon are its facets, the edges of a 3-dimensional convex polyhedron are its ridges, and the edges of a 4-dimensional polytope are its peaks. 8  See also   Extended side   References  External links       "  Category:Elementary geometry  Category:Multi-dimensional geometry  1     . ↩  Weisstein, Eric W.
