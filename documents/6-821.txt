Pluriharmonic function
In [[mathematics]], precisely in the [[Several complex variables|theory of functions of several complex variables]], a '''pluriharmonic function''' is a [[real number|real valued]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] which is [[Local property|locally]] the [[real part]] of a holomorphic function of several complex variables. Sometimes a such function is referred as '''''n''-harmonic function''', where ''n'' ≥ 2 is the [[Dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] of the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|complex domain]] where the function is defined.See fo
 r example  and .  calls such functions "fonctions biharmoniques", irrespective of the dimension n ≥ 2 : note also that his paper is perhaps the older one in which the pluriharmonic operator is expressed using the first order partial differential operators now called Wirtinger derivatives. However, in modern expositions of the theory of functions of several complex variables1 it is preferred to give an equivalent formulation of the concept, by defining pluriharmonic function a complex valued function whose restriction to every complex line is an harmonic function respect to the real and imaginary part of the complex line parameter.
Formal definition
1|Definition 1. Let 
 
 
 
  be a complex domain and 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
  (twice continuously differentiable) function. The function 
 
 
 
  is called pluriharmonic if, for every complex line



formed by using every couple of complex tuples

 
 , the function



is a harmonic function on the set


 
 .
Basic properties
Every pluriharmonic function is a harmonic function, but not the other way around. Further, it can be shown that for holomorphic functions of several complex variables the real (and the imaginary) parts are locally pluriharmonic functions. However a function being harmonic in each variable separately does not imply that it is pluriharmonic.
