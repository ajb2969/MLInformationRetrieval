   Pluriharmonic function      Pluriharmonic function  In [[mathematics]], precisely in the [[Several complex variables|theory of functions of several complex variables]], a '''pluriharmonic function''' is a [[real number|real valued]] [[Function (mathematics)|function]] which is [[Local property|locally]] the [[real part]] of a holomorphic function of several complex variables. Sometimes a such function is referred as '''''n''-harmonic function''', where ''n'' ≥ 2 is the [[Dimension (mathematics)|dimension]] of the [[Domain (mathematical analysis)|complex domain]] where the function is defined. See fo r example  and .  calls such functions " fonctions biharmoniques ", irrespective of the dimension  n ≥ 2 : note also that his paper is perhaps the older one in which the pluriharmonic operator is expressed using the first order partial differential operators now called Wirtinger derivatives . However, in modern expositions of the theory of functions of several complex variables 1 it is preferred to give an equivalent formulation of the concept, by defining pluriharmonic function a complex valued function whose restriction to every complex line is an harmonic function respect to the real and imaginary part of the complex line parameter.  Formal definition  1|Definition 1 . Let    G  ⊆    ℂ  n       G  normal-⊆  normal-   superscript  normal-ℂ  n     G⊆ ℂ^{n}   be a complex domain and    f  :   G  →   ℂ      normal-:  f    G  normal-→  normal-  normal-ℂ     f:G→ ℂ   be a   C   C   C   (twice continuously differentiable ) function. The function   f   f   f   is called pluriharmonic if, for every complex  line       {   a  +   b  z    ∣   z  ∈  ℂ   }   ⊂   ℂ  n        conditional-set    a    b  z      z  ℂ     superscript  ℂ  n     \{a+bz\mid z\in{\mathbb{C}}\}\subset\mathbb{C}^{n}     formed by using every couple of complex tuples     a  ,   b  ∈    ℂ  n       a    b  normal-∈  normal-   superscript  normal-ℂ  n      a,b∈ ℂ^{n}   , the function      z  ↦   f   (   a  +   b  z    )       maps-to  z    f    a    b  z       z\mapsto f(a+bz)     is a harmonic function on the set       {   z  ∈  ℂ   ∣    a  +   b  z    ∈  G   }   ⊂  ℂ       conditional-set    z  ℂ       a    b  z    G    ℂ    \{z\in{\mathbb{C}}\mid a+bz\in G\}\subset\mathbb{C}   .  Basic properties  Every pluriharmonic function is a harmonic function , but not the other way around. Further, it can be shown that for holomorphic functions of several complex variables the real (and the imaginary) parts are locally pluriharmonic functions. However a function being harmonic in each variable separately does not imply that it is pluriharmonic.
