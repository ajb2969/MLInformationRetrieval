   Increasing process      Increasing process   An increasing process is a stochastic process       (   X  t   )    t  ∈  M      subscript   subscript  X  t     t  M     (X_{t})_{t\in M}     where the random variables     X  t     subscript  X  t    X_{t}   which make up the process are increasing almost surely and adapted :       0  =   X  0   ≤   X   t  1    ≤  ⋯   .        0   subscript  X  0         subscript  X   subscript  t  1         normal-⋯     0=X_{0}\leq X_{t_{1}}\leq\cdots.     A continuous increasing process is such a process where the set   M   M   M   is continuous.  "  Category:Stochastic processes
