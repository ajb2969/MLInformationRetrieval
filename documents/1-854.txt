   Product of rings      Product of rings   In mathematics , it is possible to combine several rings into one large product ring . This is done as follows: if I is some index set and R i is a ring for every i in I , then the cartesian product  can be turned into a ring by defining the operations coordinate-wise.  The resulting ring is called a direct product of the rings R i . The direct product of finitely many rings coincides with the direct sum of rings.  Examples  An important example is the ring Z / n Z of integers  modulo  n . If n is written as a product of prime powers (see fundamental theorem of arithmetic ):      n  =     p  1   n  1       p  2   n  2      ⋯    p  k   n  k         n     superscript   subscript  p  1    subscript  n  1     superscript   subscript  p  2    subscript  n  2    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  p  k    subscript  n  k       n=p_{1}^{n_{1}}\ p_{2}^{n_{2}}\ \cdots\ p_{k}^{n_{k}}     where the p i are distinct primes, then Z / n Z is naturally isomorphic to the product ring             𝐙  /   p  1   n  1      𝐙    ×  𝐙   /   p  2   n  2      𝐙    ×   ⋯   ×  𝐙   /   p  k   n  k     𝐙                    𝐙   superscript   subscript  p  1    subscript  n  1     𝐙   𝐙    superscript   subscript  p  2    subscript  n  2     𝐙   normal-⋯  𝐙    superscript   subscript  p  k    subscript  n  k     𝐙    \mathbf{Z}/p_{1}^{n_{1}}\mathbf{Z}\ \times\ \mathbf{Z}/p_{2}^{n_{2}}\mathbf{Z}%
 \ \times\ \cdots\ \times\ \mathbf{Z}/p_{k}^{n_{k}}\mathbf{Z}   This follows from the Chinese remainder theorem .  Properties  If is a product of rings, then for every i in I we have a surjective  ring homomorphism  which projects the product on the i th coordinate. The product R , together with the projections p i , has the following universal property :   if S is any ring and is a ring homomorphism for every i in I , then there exists precisely one ring homomorphism  such that for every i in I .   This shows that the product of rings is an instance of products in the sense of category theory . However, despite also being called the direct sum of rings when I is finite, the product of rings is not a coproduct in the sense of category theory. In particular, if I has more than one element, the inclusion map is not ring homomorphism as it does not map the identity in ''R i'' to the identity in R .  If A i in R i is an ideal for each i in I , then is an ideal of R . If I is finite, then the converse is true, i.e. every ideal of R is of this form. However, if I is infinite and the rings R i are non-zero, then the converse is false; the set of elements with all but finitely many nonzero coordinates forms an ideal which is not a direct product of ideals of the R i . The ideal A is a prime ideal in R if all but one of the A i are equal to R i and the remaining A i is a prime ideal in R i . However, the converse is not true when I is infinite. For example, the direct sum of the R i form an ideal not contained in any such A , but the axiom of choice gives that it is contained in some maximal ideal which is a fortiori prime.  An element x in R is a unit if and only if all of its components are units, i.e. if and only if is a unit in R i for every i in I . The group of units of R is the product of the groups of units of R i .  A product of more than one non-zero rings always has zero divisors : if x is an element of the product all of whose coordinates are zero except , and y is an element of the product with all coordinates zero except (with ), then  in the product ring.
