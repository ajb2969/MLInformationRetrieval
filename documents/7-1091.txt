Logical constant

In logic, a logical constant of a language

 
  is a symbol that has the same semantic value under every interpretation of 
 
 
 
 . Two important types of logical constants are logical connectives and quantifiers. The equality predicate (usually written '=') is also treated as a logical constant in many systems of logic. One of the fundamental questions in the philosophy of logic is "What is a logical constant?"; that is, what special feature of certain constants makes them logical in nature?1
Some symbols that are commonly treated as logical constants are:

T

Many of these logical constants are sometimes denoted by alternate symbols (e.g., the use of the symbol "&" rather than "∧" to denote the logical and).
