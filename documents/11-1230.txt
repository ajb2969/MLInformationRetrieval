   Deoxyuridine phosphorylase      Deoxyuridine phosphorylase   In enzymology , a deoxyuridine phosphorylase is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2'-deoxyuridine + phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   uracil + 2-deoxy-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2'-deoxyuridine and phosphate , whereas its two products are uracil and 2-deoxy-alpha-D-ribose 1-phosphate .  No enzyme is known to be specific for this reaction, hence the EC number originally assigned to this enzyme function (EC 2.4.2.23) was deleted by the IUBMB in 2013. 1 The reaction is catalysed by , pyrimidine-nucleoside phosphorylase , , uridine phosphorylase , and , thymidine phosphorylase .  These enzymes belong to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the pentosyltransferases. They participate in pyrimidine metabolism .
