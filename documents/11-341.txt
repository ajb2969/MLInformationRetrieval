   Guanosine-diphosphatase      Guanosine-diphosphatase   In enzymology , a guanosine-diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   GDP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GMP + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are GDP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are GMP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is GDP phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called GDPase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.6.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
