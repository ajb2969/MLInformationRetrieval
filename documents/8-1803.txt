Quantum Markov chain

In mathematics, the quantum Markov chain is a reformulation of the ideas of a classical Markov chain, replacing the classical definitions of probability with quantum probability.
Introduction
Very roughly, the theory of a quantum Markov chain resembles that of a measure-many automata, with some important substitutions: the initial state is to be replaced by a density matrix, and the projection operators are to be replaced by positive operator valued measures.
Formal statement
More precisely, a quantum Markov chain is a pair 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  a density matrix and 
 
 
 
  a quantum channel such that



is a completely positive trace-preserving map, and 
 
 
 
  a C*-algebra of bounded operators. The pair must obey the quantum Markov condition, that



for all
