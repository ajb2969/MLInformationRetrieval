Dyall Hamiltonian

In quantum chemistry, the Dyall Hamiltonian is a modified Hamiltonian with two-electron nature. It can be written as follows:















where labels 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  denote core, active and virtual orbitals (see Complete active space) respectively, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the orbital energies of the involved orbitals, and 
 
 
 
  operators are the spin-traced operators 
 
 
 
 . These operators commute with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , therefore the application of these operators on a spin-pure function produces again a spin-pure function.
The Dyall Hamiltonian behaves like the true Hamiltonian inside the CAS space, having the same eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the true Hamiltonian projected onto the CAS space.
