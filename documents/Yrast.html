<h1>Yrast</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong><em>Yrast</em></strong> (; ) is a technical term in <a href="nuclear_physics" title="wikilink">nuclear physics</a> that refers to a state of a <a href="atomic_nucleus" title="wikilink">nucleus</a> with a minimum of <a class="uri" href="energy" title="wikilink">energy</a> (when it is least excited) for a given <a href="angular_momentum" title="wikilink">angular momentum</a>. <em>Yr</em> is a <a href="Swedish_language" title="wikilink">Swedish</a> adjective sharing the same root as the English <em>weary</em>. <em>Yrast</em> is the superlative of <em>yr</em> and can be translated <em>whirlingest</em>, although it literally means "dizziest" or "most bewildered". The yrast levels are vital to understanding reactions, such as off-center <a href="heavy_ion" title="wikilink">heavy ion</a> collisions, that result in high-spin states.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>

<p><strong><em>Yrare</em></strong> is the comparative of <em>yr</em> and is used to refer to the second-least energetic state of a given angular momentum.</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>An unstable nucleus may decay in several different ways: it can eject a <a class="uri" href="neutron" title="wikilink">neutron</a>, <a class="uri" href="proton" title="wikilink">proton</a>, <a href="alpha_particle" title="wikilink">alpha particle</a>, or other fragment; it can emit a <a href="gamma_ray" title="wikilink">gamma ray</a>; it can undergo <a href="beta_decay" title="wikilink">beta decay</a>. Because of the relative strengths of the <a href="fundamental_interactions" title="wikilink">fundamental interactions</a> associated with those processes (the <a href="strong_interaction" title="wikilink">strong interaction</a>, <a class="uri" href="electromagnetism" title="wikilink">electromagnetism</a>, and the <a href="weak_interaction" title="wikilink">weak interaction</a> respectively), they usually occur with frequencies in that order. Theoretically, a nucleus has a very small probability of emitting a gamma ray even if it could eject a neutron, and beta decay rarely occurs unless both of the other two pathways are highly unlikely.</p>

<p>In some instances, however, predictions based on this model underestimate the total amount of energy released in the form of gamma rays; that is, nuclei appear to have more than enough energy to eject neutrons, but decay by gamma emission instead. This discrepancy is found by the energy of a nuclear angular momentum,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> and documentation and calculation of <em>yrast</em> levels for a given system may be used for analyzing such a situation.</p>

<p>The energy stored in the angular momentum of an atomic nucleus can also be responsible for the emission of larger-than-expected particles, such as alpha particles over single <a href="nucleon" title="wikilink">nucleons</a>, because they can carry away angular momentum more effectively. This is not the only reason alpha particles are preferentially emitted, though; another reason is simply that alpha particles (He-4 nuclei) are energetically very stable in and of themselves.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>Sometimes there is a large gap between two yrast states. For example, the nucleus <sup>95</sup><a href="palladium" title="wikilink">Pd</a> has a 21/2 state that lies below the lowest 19/2, 17/2, and 15/2 states. This state does not have enough energy to undergo strong <a href="particle_decay" title="wikilink">particle decay</a>, and because of the large spin difference, gamma decay from the 21/2 state to the 13/2 state below is very unlikely. The more likely decay option is beta decay, which forms an <a href="nuclear_isomer" title="wikilink">isomer</a> with an unusually long <a class="uri" href="half-life" title="wikilink">half-life</a> of 14 seconds.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>

<p>An exceptional example is the J=9 state of <a class="uri" href="tantalum-180" title="wikilink">tantalum-180</a>, which is a very low-lying yrast state only 77 keV above the ground state. The ground state has J=1, which is too large a gap for gamma decay to occur. Alpha and beta decay are also suppressed, so strongly that the resulting isomer, <a class="uri" href="tantalum-180m" title="wikilink">tantalum-180m</a>, is effectively stable for all practical purposes, and has never been observed to decay. Tantalum-180m is the only currently known yrast isomer to be observationally stable.</p>

<p>Some superheavy isotopes (such as <a class="uri" href="copernicium" title="wikilink">copernicium</a>-285) have longer-lived isomers with half-lives on the order of minutes. These may be yrasts, but the exact angular momentum and energy is often hard to determine for these nuclides.</p>
