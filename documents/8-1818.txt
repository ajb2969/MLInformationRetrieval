Streamline diffusion




Streamline diffusion

Streamline diffusion, given an advection-diffusion equation, refers to all diffusion going on along the advection direction.
Explanation
If we take an advection equation, for simplicity of writing we have assumed 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 




we may add a diffusion term, again for simplicty, we assume the diffusion to be constant over the entire field.


 
 ,
Giving us an equation of the form:



We may now rewrite the equation on the following form:



The term below is called streamline diffusion.



Crosswind diffusion
Any diffusion orthogonal to the streamline diffusion is called crosswind diffusion, for us this becomes the term:
