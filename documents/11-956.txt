Naringenin-chalcone synthase




Naringenin-chalcone synthase

In enzymology, a naringenin-chalcone synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3 malonyl-CoA + 4-coumaroyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  4 CoA + naringenin chalcone + 3 CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and 4-coumaroyl-CoA, whereas its 3 products are CoA, naringenin chalcone, and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, to be specific those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:4-coumaroyl-CoA malonyltransferase (cyclizing). Other names in common use include chalcone synthase, flavanone synthase, 6'-deoxychalcone synthase, chalcone synthetase, DOCS, and CHS. This enzyme participates in flavonoid biosynthesis.
