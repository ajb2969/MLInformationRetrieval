Hypotaurine dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a hypotaurine dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

hypotaurine + H2O + NAD+

 
  taurine + NADH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are hypotaurine, H2O, and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are taurine, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hypotaurine:NAD+ oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in taurine and hypotaurine metabolism. It has 2 cofactors: heme, and Molybdenum.
