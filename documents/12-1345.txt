Cluster expansion

In statistical mechanics, the cluster expansion (also called the high temperature expansion or hopping expansion) is a power series expansion of the partition function of a statistical field theory around a model that is a union of non-interacting 0-dimensional field theories. Cluster expansions originated in the work of . Unlike the usual perturbation expansion, it converges in some non-trivial regions, in particular when the interaction is small.
Classical case
General theory
In statistical mechanics, the properties of a system of noninteracting particles are described using the partition function. For N noninteracting particles, the system is described by the Hamiltonian


 
 , and the partition function can be calculated (for the classical case) as


 
  From the partition function, one can calculate the Helmholtz free energy

 
  and, from that, all the thermodynamic properties of the system, like the entropy, the internal energy, the chemical potential etc.
When the particles of the system interact, an exact calculation of the partition function is usually not possible. For low density, the interactions can be approximated with a sum of two-particle potentials:


 
  , and the free energy is


 
  , where Q is the configuration integral:


 
  cannot be calculated analytically for a general pair potential 
 
 
 
 . One way to calculate the potential approximately is to use the Mayer cluster expansion. This expansion is based on the observation that the exponential in the equation for 
 
 
 
  can be written as a product of the form


 
  by 
 
 
 
 
 . After substitution, the equation for the configuration integral becomes:


 
 , and the process continues until all the higher order terms are calculated.


 
 :
$$\big.
 Q=1+\frac{N}{V}\alpha_1 + \frac{N\;(N-1)}{2\;V^2}\alpha_2+\cdots.$$
Substituting in the equation for the free energy, it is possible to derive the equation of state for the system of interacting particles. The equation will have the form
$$PV=Nk_BT\left( 1 + \frac{N}{V}B_2(T) + \frac{N^2}{V^2}B_3(T) + \frac{N^3}{V^3}B_4(T)+ \cdots \right)$$, which is known as the Virial equation, and the components $B_i(T)$ are the Virial coefficients. Each of the virial coefficients corresponds to one term from the cluster expansion ($B_2(T)$ is the two-particle interaction term, $B_3(T)$ is the three-particle interaction term and so on). Keeping only the two-particle interaction term, it can be shown that the cluster expansion, with some approximations, gives the Van der Waals equation.
This can be applied further to mixtures of gases and liquid solutions.
