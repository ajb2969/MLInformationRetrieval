   Alpha-1,4-glucan-protein synthase (ADP-forming)      Alpha-1,4-glucan-protein synthase (ADP-forming)   In enzymology , an alpha-1,4-glucan-protein synthase (ADP-forming) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ADP-glucose + protein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + alpha-D-glucosyl-protein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ADP-glucose and protein , whereas its two products are ADP and alpha-D-glucosyl-protein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ADP-glucose:protein 4-alpha-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include ADP-glucose:protein glucosyltransferase , and adenosine diphosphoglucose-protein glucosyltransferase .
