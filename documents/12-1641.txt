Fishburn–Shepp inequality

In combinatorial mathematics, the Fishburn–Shepp inequality is an inequality for the number of extensions of partial orders to linear orders, found by  and .
It states that if x, y, and z are incomparable elements of a finite poset, then
$$P(x
 
 where ''P''(*) is the probability that a linear order < extending the partial order has the property *. 
 
 In other words the probability that ''x'' < ''z'' strictly increases if one adds the condition that ''x'' < ''y''.  In the language of [[conditional probability]],
 
 :
The proof uses the Ahlswede–Daykin inequality.
