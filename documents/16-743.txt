   Quillen's theorems A and B      Quillen's theorems A and B   In topology , a branch of mathematics , Quillen's Theorem A gives a sufficient condition for the classifying spaces of two categories to be homotopy equivalent. Quillen's Theorem B gives a sufficient condition for a square consisting of classifying spaces of categories to be homotopy Cartesian . The two theorems play central roles in Quillen's Q-construction in algebraic K-theory and are named after Daniel Quillen .  The precise statements of the theorems are as follows. 1   In general, the homotopy fiber of     B  f   :    B  C   →   B  D       normal-:    B  f    normal-→    B  C     B  D      Bf:BC\to BD   is not naturally the classifying space of a category: there is no natural category    F  f      F  f    Ff   such that     F  B  f   =   B  F  f         F  B  f     B  F  f     FBf=BFf   . Theorem B is a substitute for this problem.  References     C. Weibel " The K-book: An introduction to algebraic K-theory "   "  Category:Theorems in topology     ↩
