Rees algebra

In commutative algebra, the Rees algebra of an ideal

 
  in a ring

 
  is defined to be



This construction has special interest in algebraic geometry since the projective scheme defined by the Rees algebra of an ideal in a ring is the blowing-up of the spectrum of the ring along the subscheme defined by the ideal.1
The associated graded ring of a Rees algebra of an ideal I is called (slightly abusively) the special fiber and the Krull dimension of the special fiber is called the analytic spread of I.
