   Rees algebra      Rees algebra   In commutative algebra , the Rees algebra of an ideal    I   I   I   in a ring    R   R   R   is defined to be         ⊕   n  =  0   ∞     I  n    t  n     =   R   [   I  t   ]    ⊂   R   [  t  ]     .          superscript   subscript  direct-sum    n  0         superscript  I  n    superscript  t  n       R   delimited-[]    I  t            R   delimited-[]  t       \oplus_{n=0}^{\infty}I^{n}t^{n}=R[It]\subset R[t].     This construction has special interest in algebraic geometry since the projective scheme defined by the Rees algebra of an ideal in a ring is the blowing-up of the spectrum of the ring along the subscheme defined by the ideal. 1  The associated graded ring of a Rees algebra of an ideal I is called (slightly abusively) the special fiber and the Krull dimension of the special fiber is called the analytic spread of I .
