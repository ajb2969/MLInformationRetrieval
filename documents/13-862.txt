   H-factor      H-factor   See also h-index .  H-factor is a kinetic model for the rate of delignification in kraft pulping . It is a single variable model combining temperature ( T ) and time ( t ) and assuming that the deligification is one single reaction . 1      H  =    ∫  0  t     exp   (   43.2  -   16115  /  T    )    d   t         H    superscript   subscript   0   t         43.2    16115  T     d  t      H=\int_{0}^{t}\exp\left(43.2-16115/T\right)\,dt\,     References  "  Category:Papermaking     ↩
