   UDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase      UDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase   In enzymology , an UDP-glucose 4,6-dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , UDP-glucose , and two products , UDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose 4,6-hydro-lyase (UDP-4-dehydro-6-deoxy-D-glucose-forming) . Other names in common use include UDP-D-glucose-4,6-hydrolyase , UDP-D-glucose oxidoreductase , and UDP-glucose 4,6-hydro-lyase . This enzyme participates in nucleotide sugars metabolism .
