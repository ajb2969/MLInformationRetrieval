   Multiplicative order      Multiplicative order   In number theory , given an integer  a and a positive integer n with gcd ( a , n ) = 1, the multiplicative order of a modulo n is the smallest positive integer k with   a k ≡ 1 ( mod  n ).   In other words, the multiplicative order of a modulo n is the order of a in the multiplicative group of the units in the ring of the integers modulo  n .  The order of a modulo n is usually written ord n ( a ), or O n ( a ).  Example  The powers of 4 modulo 7 are as follows:         4  0       =  1       =    0  ×  7   +  1        ≡   1     (   mod  7   )          4  1       =  4       =    0  ×  7   +  4        ≡   4     (   mod  7   )          4  2       =  16       =    2  ×  7   +  2        ≡   2     (   mod  7   )          4  3       =  64       =    9  ×  7   +  1        ≡   1     (   mod  7   )          4  4       =  256       =    36  ×  7   +  4        ≡   4     (   mod  7   )          4  5       =  1024       =    146  ×  7   +  2        ≡   2     (   mod  7   )            superscript  4  0     absent  1     absent      0  7   1      absent   annotated  1   pmod  7        superscript  4  1     absent  4     absent      0  7   4      absent   annotated  4   pmod  7        superscript  4  2     absent  16     absent      2  7   2      absent   annotated  2   pmod  7        superscript  4  3     absent  64     absent      9  7   1      absent   annotated  1   pmod  7        superscript  4  4     absent  256     absent      36  7   4      absent   annotated  4   pmod  7        superscript  4  5     absent  1024     absent      146  7   2      absent   annotated  2   pmod  7        \begin{array}[]{llll}4^{0}&=1&=0\times 7+1&\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}7)\\

 4^{5}&=1024&=146\times 7+2&\equiv 2\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}7)\\
 \end{array}     $$\text{...etc...}$$  The smallest positive integer k such that 4 k = 1 (mod 7) is 3, so O 7 (4) = 3.  Properties  Even without knowledge that we are working in the multiplicative group of integers modulo n , we can show that a actually has an order by noting that the powers of a can only take a finite number of different values modulo n , so according to the pigeonhole principle there must be two powers, say s and t and without loss of generality  s > t , such that a s ≡ a t (mod n ). Since a and n are coprime , this implies that a has an inverse element a −1 and we can multiply both sides of the congruence with a − t , yielding a s − t ≡ 1 (mod n ).  The concept of multiplicative order is a special case of the order of group elements . The multiplicative order of a number a modulo n is the order of a in the multiplicative group whose elements are the residues modulo n of the numbers coprime to n , and whose group operation is multiplication modulo n . This is the group of units of the ring  Z n ; it has φ ( n ) elements, φ being Euler's totient function , and is denoted as U ( n ) or U ( Z n ).  As a consequence of Lagrange's theorem , ord n ( a ) always divides  φ ( n ). If ord n  a is actually equal to φ ( n ) and therefore as large as possible, then a is called a primitive root modulo n . This means that the group U ( n ) is cyclic and the residue class of a generates it.  The order ord n  a also divides λ( n ), a value of the Carmichael function , which is an even stronger statement than the divisibility of φ ( n ).
