   Mean absolute error      Mean absolute error   In statistics , the mean absolute error (MAE) is a quantity used to measure how close forecasts or predictions are to the eventual outcomes. The mean absolute error is given by       MAE  =    1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    |    f  i   -   y  i    |     =    1  n     ∑   i  =  1   n    |   e  i   |      .        MAE      1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n        subscript  f  i    subscript  y  i                1  n     superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  e  i         \mathrm{MAE}=\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i=1}^{n}\left|f_{i}-y_{i}\right|=\frac{1}{n}\sum%
 _{i=1}^{n}\left|e_{i}\right|.     As the name suggests, the mean absolute error is an average of the absolute errors     |   e  i   |   =   |    f  i   -   y  i    |          subscript  e  i         subscript  f  i    subscript  y  i       |e_{i}|=|f_{i}-y_{i}|   , where    f  i     subscript  f  i    f_{i}   is the prediction and    y  i     subscript  y  i    y_{i}   the true value. Note that alternative formulations may include relative frequencies as weight factors.  The mean absolute error is a common measure of forecast error in time series analysis , where the terms "mean absolute deviation" is sometimes used in confusion with the more standard definition of mean absolute deviation . The same confusion exists more generally.  Related measures  The mean absolute error is one of a number of ways of comparing forecasts with their eventual outcomes. Well-established alternatives are the mean absolute scaled error (MASE) and the mean squared error . 1 These all summarize performance in ways that disregard the direction of over- or under- prediction; a measure that does place emphasis on this is the mean signed difference .  Where a prediction model is to be fitted using a selected performance measure, in the sense that the least squares approach is related to the mean squared error , the equivalent for mean absolute error is least absolute deviations .
