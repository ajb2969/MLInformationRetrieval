Aldos-2-ulose dehydratase

Aldos-2-ulose dehydratase (, pyranosone dehydratase, AUDH, 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose dehydratase (microthecin-forming)) is an enzyme with system name 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose hydro-lyase (microthecin-forming).12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

1,5-anhydro-D-fructose 
 
 
 
  2-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-2H-pyran-3(6H)-one + H2O (overall reaction)
 
(1a) 1,5-anhydro-D-fructose 
 
 
 
  1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose + H2O
 
(1b) 1,5-anhydro-4-deoxy-D-glycero-hex-3-en-2-ulose 
 
 
 
  2-hydroxy-2-(hydroxymethyl)-2H-pyran-3(6H)-one
 

This enzyme catalyses two of the steps in the anhydrofructose pathway.
