   Seven-dimensional space      Seven-dimensional space   In mathematics , a sequence of n  real numbers can be understood as a location in n - dimensional space. When n = 7, the set of all such locations is called 7-dimensional space . Often such a space are studied as a vector space , without any notion of distance. Seven-dimensional Euclidean space is seven-dimensional space equipped with a Euclidean metric , which is defined by the dot product .  More generally, the term may refer to a seven-dimensional vector space over any field , such as a seven-dimensional complex vector space, which has 14 real dimensions. It may also refer to a seven-dimensional manifold such as a 7-sphere , or a variety of other geometric constructions.  Seven-dimensional spaces have a number of special properties, many of them related to the octonions . An especially distinctive property is that a cross product can be defined only in three or seven dimensions. This is related to Hurwitz's theorem , which prohibits the existence of algebraic structures like the quaternions and octonions in dimensions other than 2, 4, and 8. The first exotic spheres ever discovered were seven-dimensional.  Geometry  7-polytope  A polytope in seven dimensions is called a 7-polytope. The most studied are the regular polytopes , of which there are only three in seven dimensions : the 7-simplex , 7-cube , and 7-orthoplex . A wider family are the uniform 7-polytopes , constructed from fundamental symmetry domains of reflection, each domain defined by a Coxeter group . Each uniform polytope is defined by a ringed Coxeter-Dynkin diagram . The 7-demicube is a unique polytope from the D 7 family, and 3 21 , 2 31 , and 1 32 polytopes from the E 7 family.      Regular and uniform polytopes in seven dimensions (Displayed as orthogonal projections in each Coxeter plane of symmetry)     A 6      7-simplex      6-sphere  The 6-sphere or hypersphere in seven-dimensional Euclidean space is the six-dimensional surface equidistant from a point, e.g. the origin. It has symbol , with formal definition for the 6-sphere with radius r of        S  6   =   {   x  ∈   ℝ  7    :    ∥  x  ∥   =  r   }    .       superscript  S  6    conditional-set    x   superscript  ℝ  7       norm  x   r      S^{6}=\left\{x\in\mathbb{R}^{7}:\|x\|=r\right\}.     The volume of the space bounded by this 6-sphere is        V  7    =      16   π  3    105     r  7         subscript  V  7         16   superscript  π  3    105    superscript  r  7      V_{7}\,=\frac{16\pi^{3}}{105}\,r^{7}     which is 4.72477 × r 7 , or 0.0369 of the 7-cube that contains the 6-sphere.  Applications  Cross product  As mentioned above, a cross product in seven dimensions analogous to the usual three can be defined, and in fact a cross product can only be defined in three and seven dimensions.  Exotic spheres  In 1956, John Milnor constructed an exotic sphere in 7 dimensions and showed that there are at least 7 differentiable structures on the 7-sphere. In 1963 he showed that the exact number of such structures is 28.  See also   Euclidean geometry  List of geometry topics  List of regular polytopes   References   H.S.M. Coxeter: Regular Polytopes.
