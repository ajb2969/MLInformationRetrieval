   Kōmura's theorem      Kōmura's theorem   In mathematics , Kōmura's theorem is a result on the differentiability of absolutely continuous  Banach space -valued functions, and is a substantial generalization of Lebesgue's theorem on the differentiability of the indefinite integral , which is that Φ : [0, T ] → R given by        Φ   (  t  )    =    ∫  0  t    φ   (  s  )   d  s     ,        normal-Φ  t     superscript   subscript   0   t     φ  s  normal-d  s      \Phi(t)=\int_{0}^{t}\varphi(s)\,\mathrm{d}s,     is differentiable at t for almost every 0 p space]] L 1 ([0, T ]; R ).  Statement of the theorem  Let ( X , || ||) be a reflexive Banach space and let φ : [0, T ] → X be absolutely continuous. Then φ is (strongly) differentiable almost everywhere, the derivative φ ′ lies in the Bochner space  L 1 ([0, T ]; X ), and, for all 0 ≤ t ≤ T ,        φ   (  t  )    =    φ   (  0  )    +    ∫  0  t     φ  ′    (  s  )   d  s      .        φ  t       φ  0     superscript   subscript   0   t      superscript  φ  normal-′   s  normal-d  s       \varphi(t)=\varphi(0)+\int_{0}^{t}\varphi^{\prime}(s)\,\mathrm{d}s.
