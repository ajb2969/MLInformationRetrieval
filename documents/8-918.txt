   252 (number)      252 (number)   252 ( two hundred [and] fifty-two ) is the natural number following 251 and preceding 253 .  252 is the central binomial coefficient     (      10      5      )     binomial  10  5    {\textstyle\left({{10}\atop{5}}\right)}   , 1 and is    τ   (  3  )       τ  3    \tau(3)   , where   τ   τ   \tau   is the Ramanujan tau function . 2 252 is also     σ  3    (  6  )        subscript  σ  3   6    \sigma_{3}(6)   , where    σ  3     subscript  σ  3    \sigma_{3}   is the function that sums the cubes of the divisors of its argument: 3        1  3   +   2  3   +   3  3   +   6  3    =    (    1  3   +   2  3    )    (    1  3   +   3  3    )    =  252.           superscript  1  3    superscript  2  3    superscript  3  3    superscript  6  3         superscript  1  3    superscript  2  3       superscript  1  3    superscript  3  3          252.     1^{3}+2^{3}+3^{3}+6^{3}=(1^{3}+2^{3})(1^{3}+3^{3})=252.     It is a practical number , 4 and a hexagonal pyramidal number . 5 There are 252 points on the surface of a cuboctahedron of radius five in the fcc lattice, 6 252 ways of writing the number 4 as a sum of six squares of integers, 7 252 ways of choosing four squares from a 4×4 chessboard up to reflections and rotations, 8 and 252 ways of placing four pieces on a Connect Four board. 9  References  "  Category:Integers     ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
