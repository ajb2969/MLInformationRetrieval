Orthogonal diagonalization

In linear algebra, an orthogonal diagonalization of a symmetric matrix is a diagonalization by means of an orthogonal change of coordinates.
The following is an orthogonal diagonalization algorithm that diagonalizes a quadratic form q(x) on Rn by means of an orthogonal change of coordinates X = PY.1

Step 1: find the symmetric matrix A which represents q and find its characteristic polynomial


Step 2: find the eigenvalues of A which are the roots of 
 
 
 
 .
Step 3: for each eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  of A in step 2, find an orthogonal basis of its eigenspace.
Step 4: normalize all eigenvectors in step 3 which then form an orthonormal basis of Rn.
Step 5: let P be the matrix whose columns are the normalized eigenvectors in step 4.

The X=PY is the required orthogonal change of coordinates, and the diagonal entries of 
 
 
 
 
  will be the eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  which correspond to the columns of P.
