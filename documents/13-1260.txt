   Orthogonal diagonalization      Orthogonal diagonalization   In linear algebra , an orthogonal diagonalization of a symmetric matrix is a diagonalization by means of an orthogonal change of coordinates.  The following is an orthogonal diagonalization algorithm that diagonalizes a quadratic form q ( x ) on R n by means of an orthogonal change of coordinates X = PY . 1   Step 1: find the symmetric matrix A which represents q and find its characteristic polynomial      Δ   (  t  )    .      normal-Δ  t    \Delta(t).     Step 2: find the eigenvalues of A which are the roots of    Δ   (  t  )       normal-Δ  t    \Delta(t)   .  Step 3: for each eigenvalues   λ   λ   \lambda   of A in step 2, find an orthogonal basis of its eigenspace .  Step 4: normalize all eigenvectors in step 3 which then form an orthonormal basis of R n .  Step 5: let P be the matrix whose columns are the normalized eigenvectors in step 4.   The X=PY is the required orthogonal change of coordinates, and the diagonal entries of     P  T   A  P       superscript  P  T   A  P    P^{T}AP   will be the eigenvalues     λ  1   ,  …  ,   λ  n       subscript  λ  1   normal-…   subscript  λ  n     \lambda_{1},\dots,\lambda_{n}   which correspond to the columns of P.
