Lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase I

In enzymology, a lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase I () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + lipopolysaccharide 
 
 
 
  UDP + D-glucosyl-lipopolysaccharide
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and lipopolysaccharide, whereas its two products are UDP and D-glucosyl-lipopolysaccharide.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include UDP-glucose:lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase I, lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase, uridine diphosphate glucose:lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase, I, and uridine diphosphoglucose-lipopolysaccharide glucosyltransferase. This enzyme participates in lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2.
