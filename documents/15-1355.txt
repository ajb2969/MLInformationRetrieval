TRNA (pseudouridine54-N1)-methyltransferase




TRNA (pseudouridine54-N1)-methyltransferase

TRNA (pseudouridine54-N1)-methyltransferase (, TrmY, m1Psi methyltransferase) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (pseudouridine54-N1)-methyltransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + pseudouridine54 in tRNA 
 
 
S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N1-methylpseudouridine54 in tRNA
 

This archaeal enzyme is specific for the 54 position.
