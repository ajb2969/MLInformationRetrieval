   TRNA (pseudouridine54-N1)-methyltransferase      TRNA (pseudouridine54-N1)-methyltransferase   TRNA (pseudouridine 54 -N 1 )-methyltransferase (, TrmY , m1Psi methyltransferase ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:tRNA (pseudouridine54-N1)-methyltransferase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + pseudouridine 54 in tRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N 1 - methylpseudouridine 54 in tRNA   This archaeal enzyme is specific for the 54 position.
