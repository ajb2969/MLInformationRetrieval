   Delta12-fatty acid dehydrogenase      Delta12-fatty acid dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a Delta12-fatty acid dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   linoleate + 2AH + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   crepenynate + 2A + H 2 O   where AH is either NADH or NADPH .  The 3 substrates of this enzyme are linoleate , 2AH, and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are crepenynate , 2A, and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derive from O miscellaneous.  This enzyme participates in linoleic acid metabolism .  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is linoleate, hydrogen-donor:oxygen oxidoreductase (Delta12-unsaturating) . Other names in common use include   crepenynate synthase and  linoleate Delta12-fatty acid acetylenase (desaturase).   References      "  Category:EC 1.14.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
