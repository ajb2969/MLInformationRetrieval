(S)-sulfolactate dehydrogenase

(S)-sulfolactate dehydrogenase (, (2S)-3-sulfolactate dehydrogenase, SlcC) is an enzyme with system name (2S)-sulfolactate:NAD+ oxidoreductase.1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2S)-3-sulfolactate + NAD+

 
  3-sulfopyruvate + NADH + H+


This bacterial (Chromohalobacter salexigens) enzyme acts on the 3-sulfolactate.
