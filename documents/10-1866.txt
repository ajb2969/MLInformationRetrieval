   Succinate—citramalate CoA-transferase      Succinate—citramalate CoA-transferase   In enzymology , a succinate-citramalate CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinyl-CoA + citramalate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate + citramalyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and citramalate , whereas its two products are succinate and citramalyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:citramalate CoA-transferase . Other names in common use include itaconate CoA-transferase , citramalate CoA-transferase , citramalate coenzyme A-transferase , and succinyl coenzyme A-citramalyl coenzyme A transferase . This enzyme participates in c5-branched dibasic acid metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 2.8.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
