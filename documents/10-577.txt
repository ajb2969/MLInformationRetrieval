Malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating)

In enzymology, a malate dehydrogenase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-malate + NAD+

 
  pyruvate + CO2 + NADH
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-malate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are pyruvate, CO2, and NADH.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-malate:NAD+ oxidoreductase (oxaloacetate-decarboxylating). Other names in common use include malic enzyme, pyruvic-malic carboxylase, NAD+-specific malic enzyme, NAD+-malic enzyme, and NAD+-linked malic enzyme. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism.
