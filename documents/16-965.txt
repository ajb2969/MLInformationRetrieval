   Basic element      Basic element   In algebra, a basic element  x with respect to an element y is an element of a cochain complex     (   C  *   ,  d  )      superscript  C    d    (C^{*},d)   (e.g., complex of differential forms on a manifold) that is closed     d  x   =  0        d  x   0    dx=0   and the contraction of x by y is zero.
