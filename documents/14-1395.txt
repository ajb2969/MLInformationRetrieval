Tensor glyph

In scientific visualization a tensor glyph is an object that can visualize all or most of the nine degrees of freedom, such as acceleration, twist or shear – of a 
 
 
 
  matrix. It is used for tensor field visualization, where a data-matrix is available at every point in the grid. "Glyphs, or icons, depict multiple data values by mapping them onto the shape, size, orientation, and surface appearance of a base geometric primitive."1 Tensor glyphs are a particular case of multivariate data glyphs.
There are certain types of glyphs that are commonly used:

Ellipsoid
Cuboid
Cylindrical
Superquadrics

According to T. Schultz and G. Kindlmann, specific types of tensor fields "play a central role in scientific and biomedical studies as well as in image analysis and feature-extraction methods."2
