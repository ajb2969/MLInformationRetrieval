   Variable-range hopping      Variable-range hopping   Variable-range hopping , or Mott variable-range hopping, is a model describing low-temperature conduction in strongly disordered systems with localized charge-carrier states. 1  It has a characteristic temperature dependence of      σ  =    σ  0    e   -    (    T  0   /  T   )    1  /  4           σ     subscript  σ  0    superscript  e     superscript     subscript  T  0   T     1  4         \sigma=\sigma_{0}e^{-(T_{0}/T)^{1/4}}   for three-dimensional conductance, and in general for d -dimensions      σ  =    σ  0    e   -    (    T  0   /  T   )    1  /   (   d  +  1   )            σ     subscript  σ  0    superscript  e     superscript     subscript  T  0   T     1    d  1          \sigma=\sigma_{0}e^{-(T_{0}/T)^{1/(d+1)}}   .  Hopping conduction at low temperatures is of great interest because of the savings the semiconductor industry could achieve if they were able to replace single-crystal devices with glass layers. 2  Derivation  The original Mott paper introduced a simplifying assumption that the hopping energy depends inversely on the cube of the hopping distance (in the three-dimensional case). Later it was shown that this assumption was unnecessary, and this proof is followed here. 3 In the original paper, the hopping probability at a given temperature was seen to depend on two parameters, R the spatial separation of the sites, and W , their energy separation. Apsley and Hughes noted that in a truly amorphous system, these variables are random and independent and so can be combined into a single parameter, the range    ℛ   ℛ   \textstyle\mathcal{R}   between two sites, which determines the probability of hopping between them.  Mott showed that the probability of hopping between two states of spatial separation   R   R   \textstyle R   and energy separation W has the form:      P  ∼   exp   [    -   2  α  R    -   W   k  T     ]       similar-to  P          2  α  R      W    k  T        P\sim\exp\left[-2\alpha R-\frac{W}{kT}\right]   where α −1 is the attenuation length for a hydrogen-like localised wave-function. This assumes that hopping to a state with a higher energy is the rate limiting process.  We now define    ℛ  =    2  α  R   +    W  /  k   T        ℛ      2  α  R       W  k   T      \textstyle\mathcal{R}=2\alpha R+W/kT   , the range between two states, so    P  ∼   exp   (   -  ℛ   )       similar-to  P      ℛ      \textstyle P\sim\exp(-\mathcal{R})   . The states may be regarded as points in a four-dimensional random array (three spatial coordinates and one energy coordinate), with the `distance' between them given by the range   ℛ   ℛ   \textstyle\mathcal{R}   .  Conduction is the result of many series of hops through this four-dimensional array and as short-range hops are favoured, it is the average nearest-neighbour `distance' between states which determines the overall conductivity. Thus the conductivity has the form      σ  ∼   exp   (   -    ℛ  ¯    n  n     )       similar-to  σ       subscript   normal-¯  ℛ     n  n        \sigma\sim\exp(-\overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn})   where     ℛ  ¯    n  n      subscript   normal-¯  ℛ     n  n     \textstyle\overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn}   is the average nearest-neighbour range. The problem is therefore to calculate this quantity.  The first step is to obtain    𝒩   (  ℛ  )       𝒩  ℛ    \textstyle\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{R})   , the total number of states within a range   ℛ   ℛ   \textstyle\mathcal{R}   of some initial state at the Fermi level. For d -dimensions, and under particular assumptions this turns out to be       𝒩   (  ℛ  )    =   K   ℛ   d  +  1           𝒩  ℛ     K   superscript  ℛ    d  1       \mathcal{N}(\mathcal{R})=K\mathcal{R}^{d+1}   where    K  =    N  π  k  T     3  ×   2  d     α  d         K      N  π  k  T       3   superscript  2  d     superscript  α  d       \textstyle K=\frac{N\pi kT}{3\times 2^{d}\alpha^{d}}   . The particular assumptions are simply that     ℛ  ¯    n  n      subscript   normal-¯  ℛ     n  n     \textstyle\overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn}   is well less than the band-width and comfortably bigger than the interatomic spacing.  Then the probability that a state with range   ℛ   ℛ   \textstyle\mathcal{R}   is the nearest neighbour in the four-dimensional space (or in general the ( d +1)-dimensional space) is        P   n  n     (  ℛ  )    =      ∂  𝒩    (  ℛ  )     ∂  ℛ     exp   [   -   𝒩   (  ℛ  )     ]            subscript  P    n  n    ℛ           𝒩   ℛ     ℛ          𝒩  ℛ        P_{nn}(\mathcal{R})=\frac{\partial\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{R})}{\partial\mathcal{R%
 }}\exp[-\mathcal{N}(\mathcal{R})]   the nearest-neighbour distribution.  For the d -dimensional case then        ℛ  ¯    n  n    =    ∫  0  ∞     (   d  +  1   )   K   ℛ   d  +  1     exp   (   -   K   ℛ   d  +  1      )    d  ℛ         subscript   normal-¯  ℛ     n  n      superscript   subscript   0         d  1   K   superscript  ℛ    d  1          K   superscript  ℛ    d  1       d  ℛ      \overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn}=\int_{0}^{\infty}(d+1)K\mathcal{R}^{d+1}\exp(-K%
 \mathcal{R}^{d+1})d\mathcal{R}   .  This can be evaluated by making a simple substitution of    t  =   K   ℛ   d  +  1         t    K   superscript  ℛ    d  1       \textstyle t=K\mathcal{R}^{d+1}   into the gamma function ,     Γ   (  z  )    =    ∫  0  ∞     t   z  -  1      e   -  t     d  t          normal-Γ  z     superscript   subscript   0        superscript  t    z  1     superscript  e    t    normal-d  t      \textstyle\Gamma(z)=\int_{0}^{\infty}t^{z-1}e^{-t}\,\mathrm{d}t     After some algebra this gives        ℛ  ¯    n  n    =    Γ   (    d  +  2    d  +  1    )     K   1   d  +  1           subscript   normal-¯  ℛ     n  n        normal-Γ      d  2     d  1      superscript  K    1    d  1        \overline{\mathcal{R}}_{nn}=\frac{\Gamma(\frac{d+2}{d+1})}{K^{\frac{1}{d+1}}}   and hence that      σ  ∝   exp   (   -   T   -   1   d  +  1       )       proportional-to  σ       superscript  T      1    d  1          \sigma\propto\exp\left(-T^{-\frac{1}{d+1}}\right)   .  Non-constant density of states  When the density of states is not constant (odd power law N(E)), the Mott conductivity is also recovered, as shown in this article .
