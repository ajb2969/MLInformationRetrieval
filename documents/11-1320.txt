   Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase      Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase   In enzymology , a monogalactosyldiacylglycerol synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and 1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol , whereas its two products are UDP and 3-beta-D-galactosyl-1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:1,2-diacyl-sn-glycerol 3-beta-D-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphogalactose-1,2-diacylglycerol galactosyltransferase , UDP-galactose:diacylglycerol galactosyltransferase , MGDG synthase , UDP galactose-1,2-diacylglycerol galactosyltransferase , UDP-galactose-diacylglyceride galactosyltransferase , UDP-galactose:1,2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-D-galactosyltransferase , 1beta-MGDG , and 1,2-diacylglycerol 3-beta-galactosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism .  References        "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
