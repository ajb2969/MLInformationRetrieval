Glucoside 3-dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a glucoside 3-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sucrose + acceptor 
 
 
 
  3-dehydro-alpha-D-glucosyl-beta-D-fructofuranoside + reduced acceptor
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sucrose and acceptor, whereas its two products are 3-dehydro-alpha-D-glucosyl-beta-D-fructofuranoside and reduced acceptor.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-aldohexoside:acceptor 3-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include D-glucoside 3-dehydrogenase, D-aldohexopyranoside dehydrogenase, D-aldohexoside:cytochrome c oxidoreductase, D-glucoside 3-dehydrogenase, hexopyranoside-cytochrome c oxidoreductase, and D-aldohexoside:(acceptor) 3-oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in galactose metabolism and starch and sucrose metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
