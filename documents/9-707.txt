   Cunningham correction factor      Cunningham correction factor   In fluid dynamics , the Cunningham correction factor or Cunningham slip correction factor is used to account for noncontinuum effects when calculating the drag on small particles. The derivation of Stokes Law , which is used to calculate the drag force on small particles, assumes a No-slip condition which is no longer correct at high Knudsen number . The Cunningham slip correction factor allows predicting the drag force on a particle moving a fluid with Knudsen number between the continuum regime and free molecular flow .  The drag coefficient calculated with standard correlations is divided by the Cunningham correction factor, C given below.  Ebenezer Cunningham 1 derived the correction factor in 1910 and verified with Robert Andrews Millikan the correction in the same year.      C  =   1  +     2  λ   d   ⋅   (    A  1   +    A  2   ⋅   e    -    A  3   ⋅  d    λ      )         C    1   normal-⋅      2  λ   d      subscript  A  1    normal-⋅   subscript  A  2    superscript  e       normal-⋅   subscript  A  3   d    λ          C=1+\frac{2\lambda}{d}\cdot(A_{1}+A_{2}\cdot e^{\frac{-A_{3}\cdot d}{\lambda}})     where   C is the correction factor  λ is the mean free path   d is the particle diameter  A n are experimentally determined coefficients.  For air (Davies, 1945):  A 1 = 1.257  A 2 = 0.400  A 3 = 0.55     The Cunningham correction factor becomes significant when particles become smaller than 15 micrometers, for air at ambient conditions.  For sub-micrometer particles, Brownian motion must be taken into account.
