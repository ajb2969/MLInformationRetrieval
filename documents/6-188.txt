Central binomial coefficient

In mathematics the nth central binomial coefficient is defined in terms of the binomial coefficient by



They are called central since they show up exactly in the middle of the even-numbered rows in Pascal's triangle. The first few central binomial coefficients starting at n = 0 are:


, , , , , , 924, 3432, 12870, 48620, … 


Properties
These numbers have the generating function



The Wallis product can be written in form of an asymptotic for the central binomial coefficient:



The latter can also be easily established by means of Stirling's formula. On the other hand, it can also be used as a means to determine the constant 
 
 
 
  in front of the Stirling formula, by comparison.
Simple bounds are given by



Some better bounds are



and, if more accuracy is required,


 
  for all 
 
 

The only central binomial coefficient that is odd is 1.

The closely related Catalan numbers Cn are given by:



A slight generalization of central binomial coefficients is to take them as 
 
 
 
 , with appropriate real numbers n, where 
 
 
 
  is Gamma function and 
 
 
 
  is Beta function.
