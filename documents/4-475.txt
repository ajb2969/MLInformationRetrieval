   Atwood machine      Atwood machine   (Figure)  Illustration of Atwood machine, 1905.   The Atwood machine (or Atwood's machine ) was invented in 1784 by the English mathematician  George Atwood as a laboratory experiment to verify the mechanical laws of motion with constant acceleration . Atwood's machine is a common classroom demonstration used to illustrate principles of classical mechanics .  The ideal Atwood Machine consists of two objects of mass m 1 and m 2 , connected by an inextensible massless string over an ideal massless pulley . 1  When m 1 = m 2 , the machine is in neutral equilibrium regardless of the position of the weights.  When m 1 ≠ m 2 both masses experience uniform acceleration.  Equation for constant acceleration  (Figure)  The free body diagrams of the two hanging masses of the Atwood machine. Our sign convention , depicted by the acceleration  vectors is that m 1 accelerates downward and that m 2 accelerates upward, as would be the case if m 1 > m 2   We are able to derive an equation for the acceleration by using force analysis. If we consider a massless, inextensible string and an ideal massless pulley, the only forces we have to consider are: tension force ( T ), and the weight of the two masses ( W 1 and W 2 ). To find an acceleration we need to consider the forces affecting each individual mass. Using Newton's second law (with a sign convention of we can derive a system of equations for the acceleration ( a ).  As a sign convention, we assume that a is positive when downward for    m  1     subscript  m  1    m_{1}   , and that a is positive when upward for    m  2     subscript  m  2    m_{2}   . Weight of    m  1     subscript  m  1    m_{1}   and    m  2     subscript  m  2    m_{2}   is simply     W  1   =    m  1   g        subscript  W  1      subscript  m  1   g     W_{1}=m_{1}g   and     W  2   =    m  2   g        subscript  W  2      subscript  m  2   g     W_{2}=m_{2}g   respectively.  Forces affecting m 1 :          m   1   g   -  T   =    m  1   a            subscript  m  1   g   T      subscript  m  1   a     \;m_{1}g-T=m_{1}a     Forces affecting m 2 :        T   -    m  2   g    =    m  2   a         T     subscript  m  2   g       subscript  m  2   a     \;T-m_{2}g=m_{2}a     and adding the two previous equations we obtain          m   1   g   -    m  2   g    =     m  1   a   +    m  2   a             subscript  m  1   g      subscript  m  2   g         subscript  m  1   a      subscript  m  2   a      \;m_{1}g-m_{2}g=m_{1}a+m_{2}a   ,  and our concluding formula for acceleration      a  =   g     m  1   -   m  2      m  1   +   m  2          a    g       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2        a=g{m_{1}-m_{2}\over m_{1}+m_{2}}     Conversely, the acceleration due to gravity, g , can be found by timing the movement of the weights, and calculating a value for the uniform acceleration a     d  =    1  2   a   t  2        d      1  2   a   superscript  t  2      d={1\over 2}at^{2}   .  The Atwood machine is sometimes used to illustrate the Lagrangian method of deriving equations of motion. 2  Equation for tension  It can be useful to know an equation for the tension in the string. To evaluate tension we substitute the equation for acceleration in either of the 2 force equations.      a  =   g     m  1   -   m  2      m  1   +   m  2          a    g       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2        a=g{m_{1}-m_{2}\over m_{1}+m_{2}}     For example substituting into      m  1   a   =     m  1   g   -  T          subscript  m  1   a        subscript  m  1   g   T     m_{1}a=m_{1}g-T   , we get      T  =    2  g   m  1    m  2      m  1   +   m  2     =    2  g     1  /   m  1    +   1  /   m  2            T      2  g   subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2              2  g       1   subscript  m  1      1   subscript  m  2         T={2gm_{1}m_{2}\over m_{1}+m_{2}}={2g\over 1/m_{1}+1/m_{2}}     Equations for a pulley with inertia and friction  For very small mass differences between m 1 and m 2 , the rotational inertia  I of the pulley of radius r cannot be neglected. The angular acceleration of the pulley is given by the no-slip condition:       α  =   a  r    ,      α    a  r     \alpha={a\over r},     where   α   α   \alpha   is the angular acceleration. The net torque is then:       τ  net   =     (    T  1   -   T  2    )   r   -   τ  friction    =   I  α          subscript  τ  net          subscript  T  1    subscript  T  2    r    subscript  τ  friction           I  α      \tau_{\mathrm{net}}=\left(T_{1}-T_{2}\right)r-\tau_{\mathrm{friction}}=I\alpha     Combining with Newton's second law for the hanging masses, and solving for T 1 , T 2 , and a , we get:  Acceleration:      a  =     g   (    m  1   -   m  2    )    -    τ  friction   r      m  1   +   m  2   +   I   r  2          a        g     subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2        subscript  τ  friction   r       subscript  m  1    subscript  m  2     I   superscript  r  2        a={{g(m_{1}-m_{2})-{\tau_{\mathrm{friction}}\over r}}\over{m_{1}+m_{2}+{{I}%

Many historical implementations of the machine follow this design.  An elevator with a counterbalance approximates an ideal Atwood machine and thereby relieves the driving motor from the load of holding the elevator cab — it has to overcome only weight difference and inertia of the two masses. The same principle is used for funicular railways with two connected railway cars on inclined tracks, and for the elevators on the Eiffel Tower which counterbalance each other.
