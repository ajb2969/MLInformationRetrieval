   (-)-alpha-pinene synthase      (-)-alpha-pinene synthase   (-)-alpha-pinene synthase (, (-)-alpha-pinene/(-)-camphene synthase , (-)-alpha-pinene cyclase ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, (-)-alpha-pinene-forming) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (-)- alpha-pinene + diphosphate    Cyclase II of Salvia officinalis (sage) gives about equal parts (-)-alpha-pinene, (-)- beta-pinene and (-)- camphene .
