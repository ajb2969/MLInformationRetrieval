   Matrix consimilarity      Matrix consimilarity   In linear algebra , two n -by- n  matrices  A and B are called consimilar if      A  =   S  B     S  ¯    -  1          A    S  B   superscript   normal-¯  S     1       A=SB\bar{S}^{-1}\,     for some invertible    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrix   S   S   S   , where    S  ¯     normal-¯  S    \bar{S}   denotes the elementwise complex conjugation . So for real matrices similar by some real matrix   S   S   S   , consimilarity is the same as matrix similarity .  Like ordinary similarity, consimilarity is an equivalence relation on the set of    n  ×  n      n  n    n\times n   matrices, and it is reasonable to ask what properties it preserves.  The theory of ordinary similarity arises as a result of studying linear transformations referred to different bases. Consimilarity arises as a result of studying antilinear transformations referred to different bases.  A matrix is consimilar to itself, its complex conjugate, its transpose and its adjoint matrix . Every matrix is consimilar to a real matrix and to a Hermitian matrix . There is a standard form for the consimilarity class, analogous to the Jordan normal form .
