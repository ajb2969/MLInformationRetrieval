   Half-space (geometry)      Half-space (geometry)   In geometry , a half-space is either of the two parts into which a plane divides the three-dimensional Euclidean space . More generally, a half-space is either of the two parts into which a hyperplane divides an affine space . That is, the points that are not incident to the hyperplane are partitioned into two convex sets (i.e., half-spaces), such that any subspace connecting a point in one set to a point in the other must intersect the hyperplane.  A half-space can be either open or closed . An open half-space is either of the two open sets produced by the subtraction of a hyperplane from the affine space. A closed half-space is the union of an open half-space and the hyperplane that defines it.  If the space is two-dimensional , then a half-space is called a half-plane (open or closed). A half-space in a one-dimensional space is called a ray .  A half-space may be specified by a linear inequality, derived from the linear equation that specifies the defining hyperplane.  A strict linear inequality specifies an open half-space:         a  1    x  1    +    a  2    x  2    +  ⋯  +    a  n    x  n     >  b           subscript  a  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  a  2    subscript  x  2    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    subscript  x  n     b    a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}x_{n}>b     A non-strict one specifies a closed half-space:         a  1    x  1    +    a  2    x  2    +  ⋯  +    a  n    x  n     ≥  b           subscript  a  1    subscript  x  1       subscript  a  2    subscript  x  2    normal-⋯     subscript  a  n    subscript  x  n     b    a_{1}x_{1}+a_{2}x_{2}+\cdots+a_{n}x_{n}\geq b     Here, one assumes that not all of the real numbers a 1 , a 2 , ..., a n are zero.  Properties   A half-space is a convex set .  Any convex set can be described as the (possibly infinite) intersection of half-spaces.   Upper and lower half-spaces  The open (closed) upper half-space is the half-space of all ( x 1 , x 2 , ..., x n ) such that x n > 0 (≥ 0). The open (closed) lower half-space is defined similarly, by requiring that x n be negative (non-positive).
