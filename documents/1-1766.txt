   Alexandroff extension      Alexandroff extension   In mathematical field of topology , the Alexandroff extension is a way to extend a noncompact topological space by adjoining a single point in such a way that the resulting space is compact . It is named for the Russian mathematician Pavel Alexandrov .  More precisely, let X be a topological space. Then the Alexandroff extension of X is a certain compact space X * together with an open  embedding  c : X ‚Üí X * such that the complement of X in X * consists of a single point, typically denoted ‚àû. The map c is a Hausdorff compactification if and only if X is a locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff space . For such spaces the Alexandroff extension is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification . The advantages of the Alexandroff compactification lie in its simple, often geometrically meaningful structure and the fact that it is in a precise sense minimal among all compactifications; the disadvantage lies in the fact that it only gives a Hausdorff compactification on the class of locally compact, noncompact Hausdorff spaces, unlike the Stone‚Äìƒåech compactification which exists for any Tychonoff space , a much larger class of spaces.  Example: inverse stereographic projection  A geometrically appealing example of one-point compactification is given by the inverse stereographic projection . Recall that the stereographic projection S gives an explicit homeomorphism from the unit sphere minus the north pole (0,0,1) to the Euclidean plane. The inverse stereographic projection     S   -  1    :    ‚Ñù  2   ‚Ü™   S  2       normal-:   superscript  S    1     normal-‚Ü™   superscript  ‚Ñù  2    superscript  S  2      S^{-1}:\mathbb{R}^{2}\hookrightarrow S^{2}   is an open, dense embedding into a compact Hausdorff space obtained by adjoining the additional point    ‚àû  =   (  0  ,  0  ,  1  )         0  0  1     \infty=(0,0,1)   . Under the stereographic projection latitudinal circles    z  =  c      z  c    z=c   get mapped to planar circles    r  =     (   1  +  c   )   /   (   1  -  c   )         r        1  c     1  c       r=\sqrt{(1+c)/(1-c)}   . It follows that the deleted neighborhood basis of    (  1  ,  0  ,  0  )     1  0  0    (1,0,0)   given by the punctured spherical caps    c  ‚â§  z  <  1        c  z       1     c\leq z<1   corresponds to the complements of closed planar disks    r  ‚â•     (   1  +  c   )   /   (   1  -  c   )         r        1  c     1  c       r\geq\sqrt{(1+c)/(1-c)}   . More qualitatively, a neighborhood basis at   ‚àû     \infty   is furnished by the sets      S   -  1     (    ‚Ñù  2   ‚àñ  K   )    ‚à™   {  ‚àû  }          superscript  S    1       superscript  ‚Ñù  2   K         S^{-1}(\mathbb{R}^{2}\setminus K)\cup\{\infty\}   as K ranges through the compact subsets of    ‚Ñù  2     superscript  ‚Ñù  2    \mathbb{R}^{2}   . This example already contains the key concepts of the general case.  Motivation  Let    c  :   X  ‚Ü™  Y      normal-:  c   normal-‚Ü™  X  Y     c:X\hookrightarrow Y   be an embedding from a topological space X to a compact Hausdorff topological space Y , with dense image and one-point remainder     {  ‚àû  }   =   Y  ‚àñ   c   (  X  )              Y    c  X      \{\infty\}=Y\setminus c(X)   . Then c ( X ) is open in a compact Hausdorff space so is locally compact Hausdorff, hence its homeomorphic preimage X is also locally compact Hausdorff. Moreover, if X were compact then c ( X ) would be closed in Y and hence not dense. Thus a space can only admit a one-point compactification if it is locally compact, noncompact and Hausdorff. Moreover, in such a one point compactification the image of a neighborhood basis for x in X gives a neighborhood basis for c ( x ) in c ( X ), and‚Äîbecause a subset of a compact Hausdorff space is compact if and only if it is closed‚Äîthe open neighborhoods of   ‚àû     \infty   must be all sets obtained by adjoining   ‚àû     \infty   to the image under c of a subset of X with compact complement.  The Alexandroff extension  Let X be any topological space, and let   ‚àû     \infty   be any object which is not already an element of X . Put     X  *   =   X  ‚à™   {  ‚àû  }         superscript  X      X        X^{*}=X\cup\{\infty\}   , and topologize    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   by taking as open sets all the open subsets U of X together with all subsets V which contain   ‚àû     \infty   and such that    X  ‚àñ  V      X  V    X\setminus V   is closed and compact, .  The inclusion map    c  :   X  ‚Üí   X  *       normal-:  c   normal-‚Üí  X   superscript  X       c:X\rightarrow X^{*}   is called the Alexandroff extension of X (Willard, 19A).  The above properties all follow from the above discussion:   The map c is continuous and open: it embeds X as an open subset of    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   .  The space    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   is compact.  The image c ( X ) is dense in    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   , if X is noncompact.  The space    X  *     superscript  X     X^{*}   is Hausdorff if and only if X is Hausdorff and locally compact .   The one-point compactification  In particular, the Alexandroff extension    c  :   X  ‚Üí   X  *       normal-:  c   normal-‚Üí  X   superscript  X       c:X\rightarrow X^{*}   is a compactification of X if and only if X is Hausdorff, noncompact and locally compact. In this case it is called the one-point compactification or Alexandroff compactification of X . Recall from the above discussion that any compactification with one point remainder is necessarily (isomorphic to) the Alexandroff compactification.  Let X be any noncompact Tychonoff space. Under the natural partial ordering on the set    ùíû   (  X  )       ùíû  X    \mathcal{C}(X)   of equivalence classes of compactifications, any minimal element is equivalent to the Alexandroff extension (Engelking, Theorem 3.5.12). It follows that a noncompact Tychonoff space admits a minimal compactification if and only if it is locally compact.  Further examples   The one-point compactification of the set of positive integers is homeomorphic to the space consisting of K = {0} U { 1/n | n is a positive integer.} with the order topology.    The one-point compactification of n -dimensional Euclidean space R n is homeomorphic to the n -sphere S n . As above, the map can be given explicitly as an n -dimensional inverse stereographic projection.    Since the closure of a connected subset is connected, the Alexandroff extension of a noncompact connected space is connected. However a one-point compactification may "connect" a disconnected space: for instance the one-point compactification of the disjoint union of   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   copies of the interval (0,1) is a wedge of   Œ∫   Œ∫   \kappa   circles .    The Alexandroff extension can be viewed as a functor from the category of topological spaces to the category whose objects are continuous maps    c  :   X  ‚Üí  Y      normal-:  c   normal-‚Üí  X  Y     c:X\rightarrow Y   and for which the morphisms from     c  1   :    X  1   ‚Üí   Y  1       normal-:   subscript  c  1    normal-‚Üí   subscript  X  1    subscript  Y  1      c_{1}:X_{1}\rightarrow Y_{1}   to     c  2   :    X  2   ‚Üí   Y  2       normal-:   subscript  c  2    normal-‚Üí   subscript  X  2    subscript  Y  2      c_{2}:X_{2}\rightarrow Y_{2}   are pairs of continuous maps f_X: X_1 \rightarrow X_2, \ f_Y:   Y_1 \rightarrow Y_2 such that      f  Y   ‚àò   c  1    =    c  2   ‚àò   f  X           subscript  f  Y    subscript  c  1       subscript  c  2    subscript  f  X      f_{Y}\circ c_{1}=c_{2}\circ f_{X}   . In particular, homeomorphic spaces have isomorphic Alexandroff extensions.   A sequence    {   a  n   }      subscript  a  n     \{a_{n}\}   in a topological space   X   X   X   converges to a point   a   a   a   in   X   X   X   , if and only if the map    f  :    ‚Ñï  *   ‚Üí  X      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí   superscript  ‚Ñï    X     f\colon\mathbb{N}^{*}\to X   given by     f   (  n  )    =   a  n         f  n    subscript  a  n     f(n)=a_{n}   for   n   n   n   in   ‚Ñï   ‚Ñï   \mathbb{N}   and     f   (  ‚àû  )    =  a        f    a    f(\infty)=a   is continuous. Here   ‚Ñï   ‚Ñï   \mathbb{N}   has the discrete topology .    Polyadic spaces are defined as topological spaces that are the continuous image of the power of a one-point compactification of a discrete, locally compact Haussdorff space.
