Lady Windermere's Fan (mathematics)

In mathematics, Lady Windermere's Fan is a telescopic identity employed to relate global and local error of a numerical algorithm. The name is derived from Oscar Wilde's play Lady Windermere's Fan, A Play About a Good Woman.
Lady Windermere's Fan for a function of one variable
Let 
 
 
 
  be the exact solution operator so that:








with 
 
 
 
  denoting the initial time and 
 
 
 
  the function to be approximated with a given 
 
 
 
 .
Further let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be the numerical approximation at time 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  can be attained by means of the approximation operator

 
  so that:




 
  with 
 
 




The approximation operator represents the numerical scheme used. For a simple explicit forward euler scheme with step witdth 
 
 
 
  this would be
 
 

The local error

 
  is then given by:








In abbreviation we write:














Then Lady Windermere's Fan for a function of a single variable 
 
 
 
  writes as:



with a global error of
