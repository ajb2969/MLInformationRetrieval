   Euler–Tricomi equation      Euler–Tricomi equation   In mathematics , the Euler–Tricomi equation is a linear  partial differential equation useful in the study of transonic  flow . It is named for Leonhard Euler and Francesco Giacomo Tricomi .        u   x  x    =   x   u   y  y      .       subscript  u    x  x      x   subscript  u    y  y       u_{xx}=xu_{yy}.\,     It is hyperbolic in the half plane x > 0, parabolic at x = 0 and elliptic in the half plane x x\,dx^2=dy^2, \,  which have the integral        y  ±    2  3    x   3  /  2      =  C   ,       plus-or-minus  y      2  3    superscript  x    3  2      C    y\pm\frac{2}{3}x^{3/2}=C,     where C is a constant of integration . The characteristics thus comprise two families of semicubical parabolas , with cusps on the line x = 0, the curves lying on the right hand side of the y -axis.  Particular solutions  Particular solutions to the Euler–Tricomi equations include        u  =    A  x  y   +   B  x   +   C  y   +  D    ,      u      A  x  y     B  x     C  y   D     u=Axy+Bx+Cy+D,\,          u  =    A   (    3   y  2    +   x  3    )    +   B   (    y  3   +    x  3   y    )    +   C   (    6  x   y  2    +   x  4    )      ,      u      A      3   superscript  y  2     superscript  x  3       B     superscript  y  3      superscript  x  3   y       C      6  x   superscript  y  2     superscript  x  4        u=A(3y^{2}+x^{3})+B(y^{3}+x^{3}y)+C(6xy^{2}+x^{4}),\,      where A , B , C , D are arbitrary constants.
