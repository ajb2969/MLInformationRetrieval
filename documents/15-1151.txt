Sphinganine C4-monooxygenase

Sphinganine C4-monooxygenase (, sphingolipid C4-hydroxylase, SUR2 (gene), SBH1 (gene), SBH2 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name sphinganine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (C4-hydroxylating).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

sphinganine + NADPH + H+ + O2

phytosphingosine + NADP+ + H2O
 

Sphinganine C4-monooxygenase is involved in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids in yeast and plants.
