   Sphinganine C4-monooxygenase      Sphinganine C4-monooxygenase   Sphinganine C4-monooxygenase (, sphingolipid C4-hydroxylase , SUR2 (gene) , SBH1 (gene) , SBH2 (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name sphinganine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase (C4-hydroxylating) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   sphinganine + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    phytosphingosine + NADP + + H 2 O   Sphinganine C4-monooxygenase is involved in the biosynthesis of sphingolipids in yeast and plants .
