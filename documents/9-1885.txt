Nemytskii operator

In mathematics, Nemytskii operators are a class of nonlinear operators on Lp spaces with good continuity and boundedness properties. They take their name from the mathematician Viktor Vladimirovich Nemytskii.
Definition
Let Ω be a domain (an open and connected set) in n-dimensional Euclidean space. A function f : Ω × Rm → R is said to satisfy the Carathéodory conditions if

f(x, u) is a continuous function of u for almost all x ∈ Ω;
f(x, u) is a measurable function of x for all u ∈ Rm.

Given a function f satisfying the Carathéodory conditions and a function u : Ω → Rm, define a new function F(u) : Ω → R by
$$F(u)(x) = f \big( x, u(x) \big).$$
The function F is called a Nemytskii operator.
Boundedness theorem
Let Ω be a domain, let 1 q(Ω; R), with
$$\frac1{p} + \frac1{q} = 1.$$
Suppose that f satisfies the Carathéodory conditions and that, for some constant C and all x and u,
$$\big| f(x, u) \big| \leq C | u |^{p - 1} + g(x).$$
Then the Nemytskii operator F as defined above is a bounded and continuous map from Lp(Ω; Rm) into Lq(Ω; R).
