   Pantoate kinase      Pantoate kinase   Pantoate kinase (, PoK , TK2141 protein ) is an enzyme with system name ATP:(R)-pantoate 4-phosphotransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ATP + (R)- pantoate    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + (R)-4-phosphopantoate   The conversion of (R)-pantoate to (R)-4'-phosphopantothenate is done during biosynthesis of 4'-phosphopantetheine,.
