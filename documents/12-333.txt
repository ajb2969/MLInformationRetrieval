   Peakon      Peakon   In the theory of integrable systems , a peakon ("peaked soliton") is a soliton with discontinuous first derivative ; the wave profile is shaped like the graph of the function    e   -   |  x  |       superscript  e      x      e^{-|x|}   . Some examples of non-linear partial differential equations with (multi-)peakon solutions are the Camassa–Holm shallow water wave equation , the Degasperis–Procesi equation and the Fornberg–Whitham equation . Since peakon solutions are only piecewise differentiable, they must be interpreted in a suitable weak sense . The concept was introduced in 1993 by Camassa and Holm in the short but much cited paper where they derived their shallow water equation. Peakon is also a village which beside Mobberley and also twinned with Pickford 1  A family of equations with peakon solutions  The primary example of a PDE which supports peakon solutions is          u  t   -   u   x  x  t     +    (   b  +  1   )   u   u  x     =    b   u  x    u   x  x     +   u   u   x  x  x       ,           subscript  u  t    subscript  u    x  x  t         b  1   u   subscript  u  x         b   subscript  u  x    subscript  u    x  x       u   subscript  u    x  x  x        u_{t}-u_{xxt}+(b+1)uu_{x}=bu_{x}u_{xx}+uu_{xxx},\,     where    u   (  x  ,  t  )       u   x  t     u(x,t)   is the unknown function, and b is a parameter. 2 In terms of the auxiliary function    m   (  x  ,  t  )       m   x  t     m(x,t)   defined by the relation    m  =   u  -   u   x  x         m    u   subscript  u    x  x       m=u-u_{xx}   , the equation takes the simpler form        m  t   +    m  x   u   +   b  m   u  x     =   0.          subscript  m  t      subscript  m  x   u     b  m   subscript  u  x     0.    m_{t}+m_{x}u+bmu_{x}=0.\,     This equation is integrable for exactly two values of b , namely b = 2 (the Camassa–Holm equation ) and b = 3 (the Degasperis–Procesi equation ).  The single peakon solution  The PDE above admits the travelling wave solution     u   (  x  ,  t  )    =    c    e   -   |   x  -   c  t    |            u   x  t      c   superscript  e        x    c  t          u(x,t)=c\,e^{-|x-ct|}   , which is a peaked solitary wave with amplitude c and speed c . This solution is called a (single) peakon solution, or simply a peakon . If c is negative, the wave moves to the left with the peak pointing downwards, and then it is sometimes called an antipeakon .  It is not immediately obvious in what sense the peakon solution satisfies the PDE. Since the derivative u x has a jump discontinuity at the peak, the second derivative u xx must be taken in the sense of distributions and will contain a Dirac delta function ; in fact,    m  =   u  -   u   x  x     =    c   δ   (   x  -   c  t    )          m    u   subscript  u    x  x            c  δ    x    c  t        m=u-u_{xx}=c\,\delta(x-ct)   . Now the product    m   u  x       m   subscript  u  x     mu_{x}   occurring in the PDE seems to be undefined, since the distribution m is supported at the very point where the derivative u x is undefined. An ad hoc interpretation is to take the value of u x at that point to equal the average of its left and right limits (zero, in this case). A more satisfactory way to make sense of the solution is to invert the relationship between u and m by writing    m  =    (   G  /  2   )   *  u       m      G  2   u     m=(G/2)*u   , where     G   (  x  )    =   exp   (   -   |  x  |    )          G  x         x       G(x)=\exp(-|x|)   , and use this to rewrite the PDE as a (nonlocal) hyperbolic conservation law :         ∂  t   u   +    ∂  x    [     u  2   2   +    G  2   *   (     b   u  2    2   +     (   3  -  b   )    u  x  2    2    )     ]     =  0.          subscript   t   u     subscript   x        superscript  u  2   2       G  2         b   superscript  u  2    2         3  b    superscript   subscript  u  x   2    2        0.    \partial_{t}u+\partial_{x}\left[\frac{u^{2}}{2}+\frac{G}{2}*\left(\frac{bu^{2}%
 }{2}+\frac{(3-b)u_{x}^{2}}{2}\right)\right]=0.     (The star denotes convolution with respect to x .) In this formulation the function u can simply be interpreted as a weak solution in the usual sense. 3  Multipeakon solutions  (Figure)  Two-peakon wave profile (solid curve) formed by adding two peakons (dashed curves)    u  =      m  1     e   -   |   x  -   x  1    |      +     m  2     e   -   |   x  -   x  2    |           u       subscript  m  1    superscript  e        x   subscript  x  1           subscript  m  2    superscript  e        x   subscript  x  2           u=m_{1}\,e^{-|x-x_{1}|}+m_{2}\,e^{-|x-x_{2}|}      Multipeakon solutions are formed by taking a linear combination of several peakons, each with its own time-dependent amplitude and position. (This is a very simple structure compared to the multisoliton solutions of most other integrable PDEs, like the Korteweg–de Vries equation for instance.) The n -peakon solution thus takes the form        u   (  x  ,  t  )    =    ∑   i  =  1   n     m  i    (  t  )    e   -   |   x  -    x  i    (  t  )     |        ,        u   x  t      superscript   subscript     i  1    n      subscript  m  i   t   superscript  e        x     subscript  x  i   t           u(x,t)=\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}(t)\,e^{-|x-x_{i}(t)|},     where the 2 n functions     x  i    (  t  )        subscript  x  i   t    x_{i}(t)   and     m  i    (  t  )        subscript  m  i   t    m_{i}(t)   must be chosen suitably in order for u to satisfy the PDE. For the " b -family" above it turns out that this ansatz indeed gives a solution, provided that the system of ODEs        x  ˙   k   =   ∑   i  =  1   n    m  i    e   -   |    x  k   -   x  i    |     ,    m  ˙   k   =   (  b  -  1  )    ∑   i  =  1   n    m  k    m  i   sgn   (   x  k   -   x  i   )    e   -   |    x  k   -   x  i    |      (  k  =  1  ,  …  ,  n  )      fragments   subscript   normal-˙  x   k     superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  m  i    superscript  e         subscript  x  k    subscript  x  i       normal-,   subscript   normal-˙  m   k     fragments  normal-(  b   1  normal-)    superscript   subscript     i  1    n    subscript  m  k    subscript  m  i   sgn   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  k     subscript  x  i   normal-)    superscript  e         subscript  x  k    subscript  x  i       italic-   fragments  normal-(  k   1  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  n  normal-)     \dot{x}_{k}=\sum_{i=1}^{n}m_{i}e^{-|x_{k}-x_{i}|},\qquad\dot{m}_{k}=(b-1)\sum_%

 ,\dots,n)     is satisfied. (Here sgn denotes the sign function .) Note that the right-hand side of the equation for    x  k     subscript  x  k    x_{k}   is obtained by substituting    x  =   x  k       x   subscript  x  k     x=x_{k}   in the formula for u . Similarly, the equation for    m  k     subscript  m  k    m_{k}   can be expressed in terms of    u  x     subscript  u  x    u_{x}   , if one interprets the derivative of    exp   (   -   |  x  |    )           x      \exp(-|x|)   at x = 0 as being zero. This gives the following convenient shorthand notation for the system:        x  ˙   k   =  u   (   x  k   )   ,    m  ˙   k   =  -   (  b  -  1  )    m  k    u  x    (   x  k   )    (  k  =  1  ,  …  ,  n  )   .     fragments   subscript   normal-˙  x   k    u   fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  k   normal-)   normal-,   subscript   normal-˙  m   k      fragments  normal-(  b   1  normal-)    subscript  m  k    subscript  u  x    fragments  normal-(   subscript  x  k   normal-)   italic-   fragments  normal-(  k   1  normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  n  normal-)   normal-.    \dot{x}_{k}=u(x_{k}),\qquad\dot{m}_{k}=-(b-1)m_{k}u_{x}(x_{k})\qquad(k=1,\dots%
 ,n).     The first equation provides some useful intuition about peakon dynamics: the velocity of each peakon equals the elevation of the wave at that point.  Explicit solution formulas  In the integrable cases b = 2 and b = 3, the system of ODEs describing the peakon dynamics can be solved explicitly for arbitrary n in terms of elementary functions, using inverse spectral techniques. For example, the solution for n = 3 in the Camassa–Holm case b = 2 is given by 4       a  k    (  0  )        subscript  a  k   0    a_{k}(0)   , and where the 2 n constants    λ  k     subscript  λ  k    \lambda_{k}   and    a  k     subscript  a  k    a_{k}   are determined from initial conditions. The general solution for arbitrary n can be expressed in terms of symmetric functions of    λ  k     subscript  λ  k    \lambda_{k}   and $\lambda_k$ . The general n -peakon solution in the Degasperis–Procesi case b = 3 is similar in flavour, although the detailed structure is more complicated. 5  Notes  References                 "  Category:Solitons     Camassa & Holm 1993 ↩  Degasperis, Holm & Hone 2002 ↩  Constantin & McKean 1999 (who treat the Camassa–Holm case b = 2; the general case is very similar) ↩  Beals, Sattinger & Szmigielski 2000 (where a different normalization and sign convention is used) ↩  Lundmark & Szmigielski 2005 ↩
