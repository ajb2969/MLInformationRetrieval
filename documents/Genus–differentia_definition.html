<h1>Genus–differentia definition</h1>
<hr/>

<p>A <strong>genus–differentia <a class="uri" href="definition" title="wikilink">definition</a></strong> is a type of <a href="intensional_definition" title="wikilink">intensional definition</a>, and it is composed of two parts:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>a <a class="uri" href="genus" title="wikilink">genus</a></strong> (or family): An existing definition that serves as a portion of the new definition; all definitions with the same genus are considered members of that genus.</li>
<li><strong>the <a class="uri" href="differentia" title="wikilink">differentia</a></strong>: The portion of the definition that is not provided by the genus.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, consider these two definitions:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a <a class="uri" href="triangle" title="wikilink">triangle</a></em>: A plane figure that has 3 straight bounding sides.</li>
<li><em>a <a class="uri" href="quadrilateral" title="wikilink">quadrilateral</a></em>: A plane figure that has 4 straight bounding sides.</li>
</ul>

<p>Those definitions can be expressed as one genus and two <em>differentiae</em>:</p>
<ol>
<li><em>one genus</em>:
<ul>
<li><em>the genus for both a triangle and a quadrilateral</em>: "A plane figure"</li>
</ul></li>
<li><em>two differentiae</em>:
<ul>
<li><em>the differentia for a triangle</em>: "that has 3 straight bounding sides."</li>
<li><em>the differentia for a quadrilateral</em>: "that has 4 straight bounding sides."</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h2 id="differentiation-and-abstraction">Differentiation and Abstraction</h2>

<p>The process of producing new definitions by <em>extending</em> existing definitions is commonly known as <strong>differentiation</strong> (and also as <strong>derivation</strong>). The reverse process, by which just part of an existing definition is used itself as a new definition, is called <strong><a class="uri" href="abstraction" title="wikilink">abstraction</a></strong>; the new definition is called <em>an abstraction</em> and it is said to have been <em>abstracted away from</em> the existing definition.</p>

<p>For instance, consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a <a href="square_(geometry)" title="wikilink">square</a></em>: a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles, and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.</li>
</ul>

<p>A part of that definition may be singled out (using parentheses here):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a <a href="square_(geometry)" title="wikilink">square</a></em>: (<span style="background:LightSalmon">a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles</span>), and that has bounding sides which all have the same length.</li>
</ul>

<p>and with that part, an abstraction may be formed:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="background:LightSalmon"><em>a <a class="uri" href="rectangle" title="wikilink">rectangle</a></em>: a quadrilateral that has interior angles which are all right angles.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, the definition of <em>a square</em> may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a <a href="square_(geometry)" title="wikilink">square</a></em>: <span style="background:LightSalmon">a rectangle</span> that has bounding sides which all have the same length.</li>
</ul>

<p>Similarly, the definition of <em>a square</em> may be rearranged and another portion singled out:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a <a href="square_(geometry)" title="wikilink">square</a></em>: (<span style="background:LightBlue">a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length</span>), and that has interior angles which are all right angles.</li>
</ul>

<p>leading to the following abstraction:</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="background:LightBlue"><em>a <a class="uri" href="rhombus" title="wikilink">rhombus</a></em>: a quadrilateral that has bounding sides which all have the same length.</span></li>
</ul>

<p>Then, the definition of <em>a square</em> may be recast with that abstraction as its genus:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a <a href="square_(geometry)" title="wikilink">square</a></em>: <span style="background:LightBlue">a rhombus</span> that has interior angles which are all right angles.</li>
</ul>

<p>In fact, the definition of <em>a square</em> may be recast in terms of both of the abstractions, where one acts as the genus and the other acts as the differentia:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a square</em>: <span style="background:LightSalmon">a rectangle</span> that is <span style="background:LightBlue">a rhombus</span>.</li>
<li><em>a square</em>: <span style="background:LightBlue">a rhombus</span> that is <span style="background:LightSalmon">a rectangle</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hence, abstraction is crucial in simplifying definitions.</p>
<h2 id="multiplicity">Multiplicity</h2>

<p>When multiple definitions could serve equally well, then all such definitions apply simultaneously. Thus, <em>a square</em> is a member of both the genus <em><span style="white-space: nowrap">[a] rectangle</span></em> and the genus <em><span style="white-space: nowrap">[a] rhombus</span></em>. In such a case, it is notationally convenient to consolidate the definitions into one definition that is expressed with multiple genera (and possibly no differentia, as in the following):</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a square</em>: <span style="background:LightSalmon">a rectangle</span> and <span style="background:LightBlue">a rhombus</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>or completely equivalently:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a square</em>: <span style="background:LightBlue">a rhombus</span> and <span style="background:LightSalmon">a rectangle</span>.</li>
</ul>

<p>More generally, a collection of

 equivalent definitions (each of which is expressed with one unique genus) can be recast as one definition that is expressed with

 genera. Thus, the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a Definition</em>: a Genus<sub>1</sub> that is a Genus<sub>2</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>3</sub> and that is a… and that is a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.</li>
<li><em>a Definition</em>: a Genus<sub>2</sub> that is a Genus<sub>1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>3</sub> and that is a… and that is a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.</li>
<li><em>a Definition</em>: a Genus<sub>3</sub> that is a Genus<sub>1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>2</sub> and that is a… and that is a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.</li>
<li>…</li>
<li><em>a Definition</em>: a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> that is a Genus<sub>1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>2</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>3</sub> and that is a… and that is a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.</li>
<li><em>a Definition</em>: a Genus<sub>n</sub> that is a Genus<sub>1</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>2</sub> and that is a Genus<sub>3</sub> and that is a… and that is a Genus<sub>n-1</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.</li>
</ul>

<p>could be recast as:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>a Definition</em>: a Genus<sub>1</sub> and a Genus<sub>2</sub> and a Genus<sub>3</sub> and a… and a Genus<sub>n-1</sub> and a Genus<sub>n</sub>, which has some non-genus Differentia.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="structure">Structure</h2>

<p>A genus of a definition provides a means by which to specify an <em><a href="is-a" title="wikilink">is-a relationship</a></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A square is a rectangle, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a…</li>
<li>A square is a rhombus, which is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a…</li>
<li>A square is a quadrilateral, which is a plane figure, which is a…</li>
<li>A square is a plane figure, which is a…</li>
<li>A square is a…</li>
</ul>

<p>The non-genus portion of the differentia of a definition provides a means by which to specify a <em><a href="has-a" title="wikilink">has-a relationship</a></em>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A square has an interior angle that is a right angle.</li>
<li>A square has a straight bounding side.</li>
<li>A square has a…</li>
</ul>

<p>When a system of definitions is constructed with genera and differentiae, the definitions can be thought of as nodes forming a <a class="uri" href="hierarchy" title="wikilink">hierarchy</a> or—more generally—a <a href="directed_acyclic_graph" title="wikilink">directed acyclic graph</a>; a node that has no <a href="Directed_graph" title="wikilink">predecessor</a> is <em>a most general definition</em>; each node along a directed path is <em>more <strong>differentiated</strong></em> (or <em>more <strong>derived</strong></em>) than any one of its predecessors, and a node with no <a href="Directed_graph" title="wikilink">successor</a> is <em>a most differentiated</em> (or <em>a most derived</em>) definition.</p>

<p>When a definition, <em>S</em>, is the <a href="Directed_graph" title="wikilink">tail</a> of each of its successors (that is, <em>S</em> has at least one successor and each <a href="Directed_graph" title="wikilink">direct successor</a> of <em>S</em> is a most differentiated definition), then <em>S</em> is often called <span style="white-space: nowrap"><em>the <strong><a class="uri" href="species" title="wikilink">species</a></strong></em></span> of each of its successors, and each direct successor of <em>S</em> is often called <span style="white-space: nowrap"><em>an <strong><a class="uri" href="individual" title="wikilink">individual</a></strong></em></span> (or <span style="white-space: nowrap"><em>an <strong><a class="uri" href="entity" title="wikilink">entity</a></strong></em></span>) of the species <em>S</em>; that is, the genus of an individual is synonymously called <em>the species</em> of that individual. Furthermore, the differentia of an individual is synonymously called <span style="white-space: nowrap"><em>the <a href="Identity_(philosophy)" title="wikilink">identity</a></em></span> of that individual. For instance, consider the following definition:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>[the] John Smith</em>: a human that has the name 'John Smith'.</li>
</ul>

<p>In this case:</p>
<ul>
<li>The whole definition is <em>an individual</em>; that is, <em>[the] John Smith</em> is an individual.</li>
<li>The genus of <em>[the] John Smith</em> (which is "a human") may be called synonymously <em>the species</em> of <em>[the] John Smith</em>; that is, <em>[the] John Smith</em> is an individual of the species <em>[a] human</em>.</li>
<li>The differentia of <em>[the] John Smith</em> (which is "that has the name 'John Smith'") may be called synonymously <em>the identity</em> of <em>[the] John Smith</em>; that is, <em>[the] John Smith</em> is identified among other individuals of the same species by the fact that <em>[the] John Smith</em> is the one "that has the name 'John Smith'".</li>
</ul>

<p>As in that example, the identity itself (or some part of it) is often used to refer to the entire individual, a phenomenon that is known in <a class="uri" href="linguistics" title="wikilink">linguistics</a> as a <em><a href="pars_pro_toto" title="wikilink">pars pro toto</a> <a class="uri" href="synecdoche" title="wikilink">synecdoche</a></em>.</p>
