Alkenylglycerophosphocholine hydrolase

In enzymology, an alkenylglycerophosphocholine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine + H2O 
 
 
 
  an aldehyde + sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine and H2O, whereas its two products are aldehyde and sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1-(1-alkenyl)-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine aldehydohydrolase. This enzyme is also called lysoplasmalogenase. This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism.
