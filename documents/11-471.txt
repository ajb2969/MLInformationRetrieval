   Disulfoglucosamine-6-sulfatase      Disulfoglucosamine-6-sulfatase   In enzymology , a disulfoglucosamine-6-sulfatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N,6-O-disulfo-D-glucosamine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-sulfo-D-glucosamine + sulfate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N,6-O-disulfo-D-glucosamine and H 2 O , whereas its two products are N-sulfo-D-glucosamine and sulfate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on sulfuric ester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N,6-O-disulfo-D-glucosamine 6-sulfohydrolase . Other names in common use include N-sulfoglucosamine-6-sulfatase , and 6,N-disulfoglucosamine 6-O-sulfohydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.1.6  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
