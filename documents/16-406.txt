   Inclusion (Boolean algebra)      Inclusion (Boolean algebra)   In Boolean algebra (structure) , the inclusion relation     a  ≤  b      a  b    a\leq b   is defined as     a   b  ′    =  0        a   superscript  b  normal-′    0    ab^{\prime}=0   and is the Boolean analogue to the subset relation in set theory . Inclusion is a partial order .  The inclusion relation      a  ′   +  b   =  1         superscript  a  normal-′   b   1    a^{\prime}+b=1           a  +  b   =  b        a  b   b    a+b=b     b'       a  b   =  a        a  b   a    ab=a         a  ≤   a  +  b       a    a  b     a\leq a+b      The inclusion relation has a natural interpretation in various Boolean algebras: in the subset algebra, the subset relation; in arithmetic Boolean algebra, divisibility ; in the algebra of propositions , material implication ; in the two-element algebra, the set { (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) }.  Some useful properties of the inclusion relation are:        a  b   ≤  a        a  b   a    ab\leq a         a  ≤  x  ≤  b        a  x       b     a\leq x\leq b      The inclusion relation may be used to define Boolean intervals such that $a\le x\le b$ A Boolean algebra whose carrier set is restricted to the elements in an interval is itself a Boolean algebra.
