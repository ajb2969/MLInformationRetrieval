Inclusion (Boolean algebra)

In Boolean algebra (structure), the inclusion relation

 
  is defined as 
 
 
 
  and is the Boolean analogue to the subset relation in set theory. Inclusion is a partial order.
The inclusion relation 
 
 













The inclusion relation has a natural interpretation in various Boolean algebras: in the subset algebra, the subset relation; in arithmetic Boolean algebra, divisibility; in the algebra of propositions, material implication; in the two-element algebra, the set { (0,0), (0,1), (1,1) }.
Some useful properties of the inclusion relation are:








The inclusion relation may be used to define Boolean intervals such that $a\le x\le b$ A Boolean algebra whose carrier set is restricted to the elements in an interval is itself a Boolean algebra.
