   Packed storage matrix      Packed storage matrix   A packed storage matrix , also known as packed matrix , is a term used in programming for representing an    m  Ã—  n      m  n    m\times n    matrix . It is a more compact way than an m-by-n rectangular array by exploiting a special structure of the matrix.  Typical examples of matrices that can take advantage of packed storage include:   symmetric or hermitian matrix  Triangular matrix  Banded matrix .   Code examples (Fortran)  Both of the following storage schemes are used extensively in BLAS and LAPACK.  An example of packed storage for hermitian matrix:  complex:: A(n,n) ! a hermitian matrix
 complex:: AP(n*(n+1)/2) ! packed storage for A
 ! the lower triangle of A is stored column-by-column in AP.
 ! unpacking the matrix AP to A
 do j=1,n
   k = j*(j-1)/2
   A(1:j,j) = AP(1+k:j+k)
   A(j,1:j-1) = conjg(AP(1+k:j-1+k))
 end do  An example of packed storage for banded matrix:  real:: A(m,n) ! a banded matrix with kl subdiagonals and ku superdiagonals
 real:: AP(-kl:ku,n) ! packed storage for A
 ! the band of A is stored column-by-column in AP. Some elements of AP are unused.
 ! unpacking the matrix AP to A
 do j=1,n
   forall(i=max(1,j-kl):min(m,j+ku)) A(i,j) = AP(i-j,j)
 end do
 print *,AP(0,:) ! the diagonal  "  Category:Arrays  Category:Matrices
