Integration by reduction formulae

Integration by reduction formula in integral calculus is a technique of integration, in the form of a recurrence relation. It is used when an expression containing an integer parameter, usually in the form of powers of elementary functions, or products of transcendental functions and polynomials of arbitrary degree, can't be integrated directly. But using other methods of integration a reduction formula can be set up to obtain the integral of the same or similar expression with a lower integer parameter, progressively simplifying the integral until it can be evaluated. 1 This method of integration is one of the earliest used.
How to find the reduction formula
The reduction formula can be derived using any of the common methods of integration, like integration by substitution, integration by parts, integration by trigonometric substitution, integration by partial fractions, etc. The main idea is to express an integral involving an integer parameter (e.g. power) of a function, represented by In, in terms of an integral that involves a lower value of the parameter (lower power) of that function, for example In-1 or In-2. This makes the reduction formula a type of recurrence relation. In other words, the reduction formula expresses the integral


 
  in terms of


 
  where



How to compute the integral
To compute the integral, we set n to its value and use the reduction formula to calculate the (n – 1) or (n – 2) integral. The higher index integral can be used to calculate lower index ones; the process is continued repeatedly until we reach a point where the function to be integrated can be computed, usually when its index is 0 or 1. Then we back-substitute the previous results until we have computed In. 2
Examples
Below are examples of the procedure.
Cosine integral
Typically, integrals like



can be evaluated by a reduction formula.

 , for n = 1, 2 ... 30

Start by setting:



Now re-write as:



Integrating by this substitution:






Now integrating by parts:



solving for In:









so the reduction formula is:



To supplement the example, the above can be used to evaluate the integral for (say) n = 5;



Calculating lower indices:






back-substituting:









where C is a constant.
Exponential integral
Another typical example is:


 
 .
Start by setting:



Integrating by substitution:






Now integrating by parts:






shifting indices back by 1 (so n + 1 → n, n → n – 1):



solving for In:



so the reduction formula is:
