   Cohn's irreducibility criterion      Cohn's irreducibility criterion   Arthur Cohn's irreducibility criterion is a sufficient condition for a polynomial to be irreducible in     ℤ   [  x  ]       ℤ   delimited-[]  x     \mathbb{Z}[x]    —that is, for it to be unfactorable into the product of lower-degree polynomials with integer coefficients.  The criterion is often stated as follows:   If a prime number    p   p   p   is expressed in base 10 as    p  =     a  m    10  m    +    a   m  -  1     10   m  -  1     +  ⋯  +    a  1   10   +   a  0        p       subscript  a  m    superscript  10  m       subscript  a    m  1     superscript  10    m  1     normal-⋯     subscript  a  1   10    subscript  a  0      p=a_{m}10^{m}+a_{m-1}10^{m-1}+\cdots+a_{1}10+a_{0}   (where    0  ≤   a  i   ≤  9        0   subscript  a  i        9     0\leq a_{i}\leq 9   ) then the polynomial      f   (  x  )    =     a  m    x  m    +    a   m  -  1     x   m  -  1     +  ⋯  +    a  1   x   +   a  0          f  x        subscript  a  m    superscript  x  m       subscript  a    m  1     superscript  x    m  1     normal-⋯     subscript  a  1   x    subscript  a  0      f(x)=a_{m}x^{m}+a_{m-1}x^{m-1}+\cdots+a_{1}x+a_{0}      is irreducible in    ℤ   [  x  ]       ℤ   delimited-[]  x     \mathbb{Z}[x]   .   The theorem can be generalized to other bases as follows:   Assume that    b  ≥  2      b  2    b\geq 2   is a natural number and     p   (  x  )    =     a  k    x  k    +    a   k  -  1     x   k  -  1     +  ⋯  +    a  1   x   +   a  0          p  x        subscript  a  k    superscript  x  k       subscript  a    k  1     superscript  x    k  1     normal-⋯     subscript  a  1   x    subscript  a  0      p(x)=a_{k}x^{k}+a_{k-1}x^{k-1}+\cdots+a_{1}x+a_{0}   is a polynomial such that    0  ≤   a  i   ≤   b  -  1         0   subscript  a  i          b  1      0\leq a_{i}\leq b-1   . If    p   (  b  )       p  b    p(b)   is a prime number then    p   (  x  )       p  x    p(x)   is irreducible in    ℤ   [  x  ]       ℤ   delimited-[]  x     \mathbb{Z}[x]   .   The base-10 version of the theorem attributed to Cohn by Pólya and Szegő in one of their books 1 while the generalization to any base, 2 or greater, is due to Brillhart, Filaseta , and Odlyzko . 2  In 2002, Ram Murty gave a simplified proof as well as some history of the theorem in a paper that is available online. 3  The converse of this criterion is that, if p is an irreducible polynomial with integer coefficients that have greatest common divisor 1, then there exists a base such that the coefficients of p form the representation of a prime number in that base; this is the Bunyakovsky conjecture and its truth or falsity remains an open question.  Historical notes   Polya and Szegő gave their own generalization but it has many side conditions (on the locations of the roots, for instance) so it lacks the elegance of Brillhart's, Filaseta's, and Odlyzko's generalization.  It is clear from context that the "A. Cohn" mentioned by Polya and Szegő is Arthur Cohn (1894–1940), a student of Issai Schur who was awarded his PhD in Berlin in 1921. 4 5   See also   Eisenstein's criterion   References    External links     "  Category:Polynomials  Category:Theorems in algebra     English translation in: ↩  ↩  (dvi file) ↩  Arthur Cohn's entry at the Mathematics Genealogy Project ↩  ↩
