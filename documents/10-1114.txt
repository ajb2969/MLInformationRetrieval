   Procollagen-proline 3-dioxygenase      Procollagen-proline 3-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a procollagen-proline 3-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   procollagen L-proline + 2-oxoglutarate + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   procollagen trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline + succinate + CO 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are procollagen L-proline , 2-oxoglutarate , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are procollagen trans-3-hydroxy-L-proline , succinate , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with 2-oxoglutarate as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into each donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is procollagen-L-proline,2-oxoglutarate:oxygen oxidoreductase (3-hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include proline,2-oxoglutarate 3-dioxygenase , prolyl 3-hydroxylase , protocollagen proline 3-hydroxylase , prolyl-4-hydroxyprolyl-glycyl-peptide, 2-oxoglutarate: oxygen , and oxidoreductase, 3-hydroxylating . It has 2 cofactors : iron , and Ascorbate .
