Trans,polycis-decaprenyl diphosphate synthase

Trans,polycis-decaprenyl diphosphate synthase (, Rv2361c, (2Z,6Z,10Z,14Z,18Z,22Z,26Z,30Z,34E)-decaprenyl diphosphate synthase) is an enzyme with system name ''(2Z,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate:isopentenyl-diphosphate farnesylcistransferase (adding 7 isopentenyl units) ''.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2Z,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate + 7 isopentenyl diphosphate

 
  7 diphosphate + trans,octacis-decaprenyl diphosphate
 

The enzyme is involved in the biosynthesis of decaprenyl phosphate.
