   1-Hydroxycarotenoid 3,4-desaturase      1-Hydroxycarotenoid 3,4-desaturase   1-Hydroxycarotenoid 3,4-desaturase (, CrtD , hydroxyneurosporene desaturase , carotenoid 3,4-dehydrogenase , 1-hydroxy-carotenoid 3,4-dehydrogenase ) is an enzyme with system name 1-hydroxy-1,2-dihydrolycopene:acceptor oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   1-hydroxy-1,2-dihydrolycopene + acceptor   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1-hydroxy-3,4-didehydro-1,2-dihydrolycopene + reduced acceptor   The enzymes from Rubrivivax gelatinosus and Rhodobacter sphaeroides acts primarily on acyclic carotenoids .
