   Divisor summatory function      Divisor summatory function     In number theory , the divisor summatory function is a function that is a sum over the divisor function . It frequently occurs in the study of the asymptotic behaviour of the Riemann zeta function . The various studies of the behaviour of the divisor function are sometimes called divisor problems .  Definition  The divisor summatory function is defined as       D   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  ≤  x     d   (  n  )     =    ∑       j  ,  k         j  k   ≤  x        1           D  x     subscript     n  x      d  n           subscript    STACKED   j  k       j  k   x     1      D(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}d(n)=\sum_{j,k\atop jk\leq x}1     where       d   (  n  )    =    σ  0    (  n  )    =    ∑       j  ,  k         j  k   =  n        1           d  n      subscript  σ  0   n          subscript    STACKED   j  k       j  k   n     1      d(n)=\sigma_{0}(n)=\sum_{j,k\atop jk=n}1     is the divisor function . The divisor function counts the number of ways that the integer n can be written as a product of two integers. More generally, one defines        D  k    (  x  )    =    ∑   n  ≤  x      d  k    (  n  )     =    ∑    m  n   ≤  x      d   k  -  1     (  n  )              subscript  D  k   x     subscript     n  x       subscript  d  k   n           subscript       m  n   x       subscript  d    k  1    n       D_{k}(x)=\sum_{n\leq x}d_{k}(n)=\sum_{mn\leq x}d_{k-1}(n)     where d k ( n ) counts the number of ways that n can be written as a product of k numbers. This quantity can be visualized as the count of the number of lattice points fenced off by a hyperbolic surface in k dimensions. Thus, for k =2, D ( x )= D 2 ( x ) counts the number of points on a square lattice bounded on the left by the vertical-axis, on the bottom by the horizontal-axis, and to the upper-right by the hyperbola jk = x . Roughly, this shape may be envisioned as a hyperbolic simplex . This allows us to provide an alternative expression for D ( x ), and a simple way to compute it in    O   (   x   )       O    x     O(\sqrt{x})   time:       D   (  x  )    =    ∑   k  =  1   x    ⌊   x  k   ⌋    =    2    ∑   k  =  1   u    ⌊   x  k   ⌋     -   u  2            D  x     superscript   subscript     k  1    x       x  k              2    superscript   subscript     k  1    u       x  k       superscript  u  2       D(x)=\sum_{k=1}^{x}\left\lfloor\frac{x}{k}\right\rfloor=2\sum_{k=1}^{u}\left%
 \lfloor\frac{x}{k}\right\rfloor-u^{2}   , where    u  =   ⌊   x   ⌋       u      x      u=\left\lfloor\sqrt{x}\right\rfloor     If the hyperbola in this context is replaced by a circle then determining the value of the resulting function is known as the Gauss circle problem .  Dirichlet's divisor problem  Finding a closed form for this summed expression seems to be beyond the techniques available, but it is possible to give approximations. The leading behaviour of the series is not difficult to obtain. Peter Dirichlet demonstrated that       D   (  x  )    =    x   log  x    +   x   (    2  γ   -  1   )    +   Δ   (  x  )           D  x       x    x      x      2  γ   1      normal-Δ  x      D(x)=x\log x+x(2\gamma-1)+\Delta(x)     where   γ   γ   \gamma   is the Euler-Mascheroni constant , and the non-leading term is        Δ   (  x  )    =   O   (   x   )     .        normal-Δ  x     O    x      \Delta(x)=O\left(\sqrt{x}\right).     Here,   O   O   O   denotes Big-O notation . The Dirichlet divisor problem , precisely stated, is to find the smallest value of   θ   θ   \theta   for which       Δ   (  x  )    =   O   (   x   θ  +  ϵ    )          normal-Δ  x     O   superscript  x    θ  ϵ       \Delta(x)=O\left(x^{\theta+\epsilon}\right)     holds true, for any    ϵ  >  0      ϵ  0    \epsilon>0   . , this problem remains unsolved. Progress has been slow. Many of the same methods work for this problem and for Gauss's circle problem , another lattice-point counting problem. Section F1 of Unsolved Problems in Number Theory  1 surveys what is known and not known about these problems.   In 1904, G. Voronoi proved that the error term can be improved to     O   (    x   1  /  3     log  x    )    .      O     superscript  x    1  3      x      O(x^{1/3}\log x).        In 1916, G.H. Hardy showed that     inf  θ   ≥   1  /  4        infimum  θ     1  4     \inf\theta\geq 1/4   . In particular, he demonstrated that for some constant   K   K   K   , there exist values of x for which     Δ   (  x  )    >   K   x   1  /  4           normal-Δ  x     K   superscript  x    1  4       \Delta(x)>Kx^{1/4}   and values of x for which     Δ   (  x  )    <   -   K   x   1  /  4            normal-Δ  x       K   superscript  x    1  4        \Delta(x)<-Kx^{1/4}   . 2  In 1922, J. van der Corput improved Dirichlet's bound to     inf  θ   ≤   33  /  100.        infimum  θ     33  100.     \inf\theta\leq 33/100.    3  In 1928, J. van der Corput proved that     inf  θ   ≤   27  /  82.        infimum  θ     27  82.     \inf\theta\leq 27/82.    4  In 1950, Chih Tsung-tao and independently in 1953 H. E. Richert proved that     inf  θ   ≤   15  /  46.        infimum  θ     15  46.     \inf\theta\leq 15/46.    5  In 1969, Grigori Kolesnik demonstrated that     inf  θ   ≤   12  /  37        infimum  θ     12  37     \inf\theta\leq 12/37   . 6  In 1973, Grigori Kolesnik demonstrated that     inf  θ   ≤   346  /  1067        infimum  θ     346  1067     \inf\theta\leq 346/1067   . 7  In 1982, Grigori Kolesnik demonstrated that     inf  θ   ≤   35  /  108        infimum  θ     35  108     \inf\theta\leq 35/108   . 8  In 1988, H. Iwaniec and C. J. Mozzochi proved that     inf  θ   ≤   7  /  22.        infimum  θ     7  22.     \inf\theta\leq 7/22.    9  In 2003, M.N. Huxley improved this to show that     inf  θ   ≤   131  /  416.        infimum  θ     131  416.     \inf\theta\leq 131/416.    10   So, the true value of    inf  θ     infimum  θ    \inf\theta   lies somewhere between 1/4 and 131/416 (approx. 0.3149); it is widely conjectured to be exactly 1/4. Theoretical evidence lends credence to this conjecture, since     Δ   (  x  )    /   x   1  /  4          normal-Δ  x    superscript  x    1  4      \Delta(x)/x^{1/4}   has a (non-Gaussian) limiting distribution. The value of 1/4 would also follow from a conjecture on exponent pairs . 11  Piltz divisor problem  In the generalized case, one has        D  k    (  x  )    =    x   P  k    (   log  x   )    +    Δ  k    (  x  )            subscript  D  k   x       x   subscript  P  k     x       subscript  normal-Δ  k   x      D_{k}(x)=xP_{k}(\log x)+\Delta_{k}(x)\,     where    P  k     subscript  P  k    P_{k}   is a polynomial of degree     k  -  1      k  1    k-1   . Using simple estimates, it is readily shown that        Δ  k    (  x  )    =   O   (    x   1  -   1  /  k       log   k  -  2    x    )           subscript  normal-Δ  k   x     O     superscript  x    1    1  k       superscript     k  2    x       \Delta_{k}(x)=O\left(x^{1-1/k}\log^{k-2}x\right)     for integer    k  ≥  2      k  2    k\geq 2   . As in the    k  =  2      k  2    k=2   case, the infimum of the bound is not known for any value of   k   k   k   . Computing these infima is known as the Piltz divisor problem, after the name of the German mathematician Adolf Piltz (also see his German page). Defining the order    α  k     subscript  α  k    \alpha_{k}   as the smallest value for which      Δ  k    (  x  )    =   O   (   x    α  k   +  ε    )           subscript  normal-Δ  k   x     O   superscript  x     subscript  α  k   ε       \Delta_{k}(x)=O\left(x^{\alpha_{k}+\varepsilon}\right)   holds, for any    ε  >  0      ε  0    \varepsilon>0   , one has the following results (note that    α  2     subscript  α  2    \alpha_{2}   is the   θ   θ   \theta   of the previous section):        α  2   ≤    131  416     ,       subscript  α  2     131  416     \alpha_{2}\leq\frac{131}{416}\ ,    12        α  3   ≤    43  96     ,       subscript  α  3     43  96     \alpha_{3}\leq\frac{43}{96}\ ,    13 and 14       α  k   ≤     3  k   -  4    4  k     (  4  ≤  k  ≤  8  )   ,     fragments   subscript  α  k          3  k   4     4  k      fragments  normal-(  4   k   8  normal-)   normal-,    \alpha_{k}\leq\frac{3k-4}{4k}\quad(4\leq k\leq 8)\ ,          α  9   ≤    35  54    ,   α  10   ≤    41  60    ,   α  11   ≤   7  10   ,     fragments   subscript  α  9      35  54   normal-,   subscript  α  10      41  60   normal-,   subscript  α  11      7  10   italic-  normal-,    \alpha_{9}\leq\frac{35}{54}\ ,\quad\alpha_{10}\leq\frac{41}{60}\ ,\quad\alpha_%

E.C. Titchmarsh conjectures that      α  k   =     k  -  1    2  k      .       subscript  α  k       k  1     2  k      \alpha_{k}=\frac{k-1}{2k}\ .      Mellin transform  Both portions may be expressed as Mellin transforms :       D   (  x  )    =    1   2  π  i      ∫   c  -   i  ∞     c  +   i  ∞       ζ  2    (  w  )      x  w   w    d  w           D  x       1    2  π  i      superscript   subscript     c    i        c    i         superscript  ζ  2   w     superscript  x  w   w   d  w       D(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c-i\infty}^{c+i\infty}\zeta^{2}(w)\frac{x^{w}}{w}\,dw     for    c  >  1      c  1    c>1   . Here,    ζ   (  s  )       ζ  s    \zeta(s)   is the Riemann zeta function . Similarly, one has       Δ   (  x  )    =    1   2  π  i      ∫    c  ′   -   i  ∞      c  ′   +   i  ∞       ζ  2    (  w  )      x  w   w    d  w           normal-Δ  x       1    2  π  i      superscript   subscript      superscript  c  normal-′     i         superscript  c  normal-′     i         superscript  ζ  2   w     superscript  x  w   w   d  w       \Delta(x)=\frac{1}{2\pi i}\int_{c^{\prime}-i\infty}^{c^{\prime}+i\infty}\zeta^%

In general, one has       Δ  k    (  x  )        subscript  normal-Δ  k   x    \Delta_{k}(x)     and likewise for    k  ≥  2      k  2    k\geq 2   , for $k\ge 2$ .  Notes    References   H.M.
