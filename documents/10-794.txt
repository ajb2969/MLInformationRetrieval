   Methanol—5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase      Methanol—5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a methanol-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   methanol + 5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   Co-methyl-Co-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcob(I)amide + H 2 O   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are methanol and 5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide , whereas its two products are Co-methyl-Co-5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcob(I)amide and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide Co-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include methanol cobalamin methyltransferase , methanol:5-hydroxybenzimidazolylcobamide methyltransferase , and MT 1 .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
