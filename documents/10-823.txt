   Pyridine N-methyltransferase      Pyridine N-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a pyridine N-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + pyridine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + N-methylpyridinium   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and pyridine , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and N-methylpyridinium .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:pyridine N-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called pyridine methyltransferase .
