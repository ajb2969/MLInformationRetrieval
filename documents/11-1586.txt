   Protein-histidine pros-kinase      Protein-histidine pros-kinase   In enzymology , a protein-histidine pros-kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + protein L -histidine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + protein N π -phospho- L -histidine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and protein L-histidine , whereas its two products are ADP and protein Npi-phospho-L-histidine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring a phosphate group to the sidechain of histidine residues in proteins (protein-histidine kinases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:protein-L-histidine Npi-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include ATP:protein-L-histidine N-pros-phosphotransferase , histidine kinase , histidine protein kinase , protein histidine kinase , protein kinase (histidine) , and HK2 .
