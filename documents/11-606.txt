   AMP nucleosidase      AMP nucleosidase   In enzymology , an AMP nucleosidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   AMP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-ribose 5-phosphate + adenine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are AMP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are D-ribose 5-phosphate and adenine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those glycosylases that hydrolyse N-glycosyl compounds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is AMP phosphoribohydrolase . Other names in common use include adenylate nucleosidase , and adenosine monophosphate nucleosidase . This enzyme participates in purine metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
