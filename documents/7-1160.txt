Slice knot

A slice knot is a type of mathematical knot. In knot theory, a "knot" means an embedded circle in the 3-sphere


 
  and that the 3-sphere can be thought of as the boundary of the four-dimensional ball


 
  A knot 
 
 
 
  is slice if it bounds a nicely embedded disk D in the 4-ball.1
What is meant by "nicely embedded" depends on the context, and there are different terms for different kinds of slice knots. If D is smoothly embedded in B4, then K is said to be smoothly slice. If K is only locally flat (which is weaker), then K is said to be topologically slice.
Every ribbon knot is smoothly slice. An old question of Fox asks whether every slice knot is actually a ribbon knot.2
The signature of a slice knot is zero.3
The Alexander polynomial of a slice knot factors as a product 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is some integral Laurent polynomial.4 This is known as the Fox–Milnor condition.5
The following is a list of all slice knots with 10 or fewer crossings; it was compiled using the Knot Atlas: 61,
