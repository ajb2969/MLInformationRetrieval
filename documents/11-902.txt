   Formate C-acetyltransferase      Formate C-acetyltransferase   In enzymology , a formate C-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acetyl-CoA + formate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + pyruvate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and formate , whereas its two products are CoA and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:formate C-acetyltransferase . Other names in common use include pyruvate formate-lyase , pyruvic formate-lyase , and formate acetyltransferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : pyruvate metabolism , propanoate metabolism , and butanoate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 8 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , and .
