It is constructed as an alternation of the regular 7-cubic honeycomb .  It is composed of two different types of facets . The 7-cubes become alternated into 7-demicubes h{4,3,3,3,3,3} and the alternated vertices create 7-orthoplex {3,3,3,3,3,4} facets.  D7 lattice  The vertex arrangement of the 7-demicubic honeycomb is the D 7 lattice . 1 The 84 vertices of the rectified 7-orthoplex  vertex figure of the 7-demicubic honeycomb reflect the kissing number 84 of this lattice. 2 The best known is 126, from the E 7 lattice and the 3 31 honeycomb .  The D     7     +     subscript   superscript  absent    7    {}^{+}_{7}   packing (also called D     7     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   7    {}^{2}_{7}   ) can be constructed by the union of two D 7 lattices . The D     n     +     subscript   superscript  absent    n    {}^{+}_{n}   packings form lattices only in even dimensions. The kissing number is 2 6 =64 (2 n-1 for n8). 3    ∪    The D     7     *     subscript   superscript  absent    7    {}^{*}_{7}   lattice (also called D     7     4     subscript   superscript  absent  4   7    {}^{4}_{7}   and C     7     2     subscript   superscript  absent  2   7    {}^{2}_{7}   ) can be constructed by the union of all four 7-demicubic lattices: 4 It is also the 7-dimensional body centered cubic , the union of two 7-cube honeycombs in dual positions.    ∪  ∪  ∪  =  ∪ .    The kissing number of the D     7     *     subscript   superscript  absent    7    {}^{*}_{7}   lattice is 14 ( 2n for n≥5) and its Voronoi tessellation is a quadritruncated 7-cubic honeycomb , , containing all with tritruncated 7-orthoplex , Voronoi cells . 5  Symmetry constructions  There are three uniform construction symmetries of this tessellation. Each symmetry can be represented by arrangements of differened colors on the 128 7-demicube facets around each vertex.
