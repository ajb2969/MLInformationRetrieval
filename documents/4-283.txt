   Total variation distance of probability measures      Total variation distance of probability measures   In probability theory , the total variation distance is a distance measure for probability distributions. It is an example of a statistical distance metric, and is sometimes just called "the" statistical distance .  Definition  The total variation distance between two probability measures  P and Q on a sigma-algebra     ℱ   ℱ   \mathcal{F}    of subsets of the sample space   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is defined via 1        δ   (  P  ,  Q  )    =    sup   A  ∈  ℱ     |    P   (  A  )    -   Q   (  A  )     |     .        δ   P  Q      subscript  supremum    A  ℱ          P  A     Q  A        \delta(P,Q)=\sup_{A\in\mathcal{F}}\left|P(A)-Q(A)\right|.     Informally, this is the largest possible difference between the probabilities that the two probability distributions can assign to the same event.  Special cases  For a finite alphabet we can relate the total variation distance to the 1-norm of the difference of the two probability distributions as follows: 2        δ   (  P  ,  Q  )    =    1  2     ∥   P  -  Q   ∥   1    =    1  2     ∑  x    |    P   (  x  )    -   Q   (  x  )     |      .          δ   P  Q        1  2    subscript   norm    P  Q    1             1  2     subscript   x         P  x     Q  x          \delta(P,Q)=\frac{1}{2}\|P-Q\|_{1}=\frac{1}{2}\sum_{x}\left|P(x)-Q(x)\right|\;.     Similarly, for arbitrary sample space   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   , measure   μ   μ   \mu   , and probability measures   P   P   P   and   Q   Q   Q   with Radon-Nikodym derivatives    f  P     subscript  f  P    f_{P}   and    f  Q     subscript  f  Q    f_{Q}   with respect to   μ   μ   \mu   , an equivalent definition of the total variation distance is        δ   (  P  ,  Q  )    =    1  2     ∥    f  P   -   f  Q    ∥     L  1    (  μ  )      =    1  2     ∫  Ω     |    f  P   -   f  Q    |   d   μ       .          δ   P  Q        1  2    subscript   norm     subscript  f  P    subscript  f  Q        subscript  L  1   μ              1  2     subscript   normal-Ω          subscript  f  P    subscript  f  Q     d  μ        \delta(P,Q)=\frac{1}{2}\|f_{P}-f_{Q}\|_{L_{1}(\mu)}=\frac{1}{2}\int_{\Omega}%
 \left|f_{P}-f_{Q}\right|d\mu\;.     Relationship with other concepts  The total variation distance is related to the Kullback–Leibler divergence by Pinsker's inequality .
