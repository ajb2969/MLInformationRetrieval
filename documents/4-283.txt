Total variation distance of probability measures

In probability theory, the total variation distance is a distance measure for probability distributions. It is an example of a statistical distance metric, and is sometimes just called "the" statistical distance.
Definition
The total variation distance between two probability measures P and Q on a sigma-algebra 

 of subsets of the sample space 
 
 
 
  is defined via1



Informally, this is the largest possible difference between the probabilities that the two probability distributions can assign to the same event.
Special cases
For a finite alphabet we can relate the total variation distance to the 1-norm of the difference of the two probability distributions as follows:2



Similarly, for arbitrary sample space 
 
 
 
 , measure 
 
 
 
 , and probability measures 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with Radon-Nikodym derivatives 
 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
 , an equivalent definition of the total variation distance is



Relationship with other concepts
The total variation distance is related to the Kullback–Leibler divergence by Pinsker's inequality.
