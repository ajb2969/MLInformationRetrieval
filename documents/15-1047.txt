3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine oxidative deaminase

3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine oxidative deaminase (, 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine: oxidative deaminase, oxidative deaminase, DOPA oxidative deaminase, DOPAODA) is an enzyme with system name 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine:oxygen oxidoreductase (deaminating).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 L-dopa + O2

 
  2 3,4-dihydroxyphenylpyruvate + 2 NH3


This enzyme is one of the three enzymes involved in L-dopa (3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine) catabolism in the bacterium Rubrivivax benzoatilyticus.
