   Stickelberger's theorem      Stickelberger's theorem   In mathematics , Stickelberger's theorem is a result of algebraic number theory , which gives some information about the Galois module structure of class groups of cyclotomic fields . A special case was first proven by Ernst Kummer ( Kummer|1847}}|1847 ) while the general result is due to Ludwig Stickelberger ( Stickelberger|1890}}|1890 ). 1  The Stickelberger element and the Stickelberger ideal  Let K m denote the m th cyclotomic field , i.e. the extension of the rational numbers obtained by adjoining the m th roots of unity to Q (where m ≥ 2 is an integer). It is a Galois extension of Q with Galois group  G m isomorphic to the multiplicative group of integers modulo m ( Z / m Z ) × . The Stickelberger element ( of level m or of  K m ) is an element in the group ring  Q [ G m ] and the Stickelberger ideal ( of level m or of  K m ) is an ideal in the group ring Z [ G m ]. They are defined as follows. Let ζ m denote a primitive m th root of unity . The isomorphism from ( Z / m Z ) × to G m is given by sending a to σ a defined by the relation   σ a (ζ m ) =    ζ  m  a     superscript   subscript  ζ  m   a    {ζ}_{m}^{a}   .   The Stickelberger element of level m is defined as        θ   (   K  m   )    =     1  m     ∑   a  =  1   m     (  a  ,  m  )   =  1    a   ⋅   σ  a   -  1     ∈   𝐐   [   G  m   ]     .          θ   subscript  K  m     normal-⋅      1  m       a  m   1    superscript   subscript     a  1    m    a    superscript   subscript  σ  a     1            𝐐   delimited-[]   subscript  G  m        \theta(K_{m})=\frac{1}{m}\underset{(a,m)=1}{\sum_{a=1}^{m}}a\cdot\sigma_{a}^{-%

The Stickelberger ideal of level m , denoted I ( K m ), is the set of integral multiples of θ( K m ) which have integral coefficients, i.e.        I   (   K  m   )    =    θ   (   K  m   )   𝐙   [   G  m   ]    ∩   𝐙   [   G  m   ]      .

More generally, if F be any abelian number field whose Galois group over Q is denoted G F , then the Stickelberger element of  F and the Stickelberger ideal of  F can be defined. By the Kronecker–Weber theorem there is an integer m such that F is contained in K m . Fix the least such m (this is the (finite part of the) conductor of F over Q ). There is a natural group homomorphism  G m → G F given by restriction, i.e. if σ ∈ G m , its image in G F is its restriction to F denoted res m σ. The Stickelberger element of F is then defined as        θ   (  F  )    =      1  m     ∑   a  =  1   m     (  a  ,  m  )   =  1    a   ⋅   res  m     σ  a   -  1     ∈   𝐐   [   G  F   ]     .          θ  F      normal-⋅      1  m       a  m   1    superscript   subscript     a  1    m    a    subscript  res  m     superscript   subscript  σ  a     1            𝐐   delimited-[]   subscript  G  F        \theta(F)=\frac{1}{m}\underset{(a,m)=1}{\sum_{a=1}^{m}}a\cdot\mathrm{res}_{m}%
 \sigma_{a}^{-1}\in\mathbf{Q}[G_{F}].   The Stickelberger ideal of F , denoted I ( F ), is defined as in the case of K m , i.e.        I   (  F  )    =    θ   (  F  )   𝐙   [   G  F   ]    ∩   𝐙   [   G  F   ]      .

In the special case where F = K m , the Stickelberger ideal I ( K m ) is generated by ( a − σ a )θ( K m ) as a varies over Z / m Z . This not true for general F . 2  Examples   If F is a totally real field of conductor m , then 3           θ   (  F  )    =     ϕ   (  m  )     2   [  F  :  𝐐  ]       ∑   σ  ∈   G  F     σ     ,        θ  F         ϕ  m    fragments  2   fragments  normal-[  F  normal-:  Q  normal-]       subscript     σ   subscript  G  F     σ      \theta(F)=\frac{\phi(m)}{2[F:\mathbf{Q}]}\sum_{\sigma\in G_{F}}\sigma,       where φ is the Euler totient function and [ F : Q ] is the degree of F over Q .   Statement of the theorem   Stickelberger's Theorem 4   Let F be an abelian number field. Then, the Stickelberger ideal of F  annihilates the class group of F .   Note that θ( F ) itself need not be an annihilator, but any multiple of it in Z [ G F ] is.  Explicitly, the theorem is saying that if α ∈ Z [ G F ] is such that       α  θ   (  F  )    =    ∑   σ  ∈   G  F       a  σ   σ    ∈   𝐙   [   G  F   ]            α  θ  F     subscript     σ   subscript  G  F        subscript  a  σ   σ           𝐙   delimited-[]   subscript  G  F        \alpha\theta(F)=\sum_{\sigma\in G_{F}}a_{\sigma}\sigma\in\mathbf{Z}[G_{F}]   and if J is any fractional ideal of F , then       ∏   σ  ∈   G  F      σ   (   J   a  σ    )        subscript  product    σ   subscript  G  F       σ   superscript  J   subscript  a  σ       \prod_{\sigma\in G_{F}}\sigma(J^{a_{\sigma}})   is a principal ideal .
