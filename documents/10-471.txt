   Benzyl-2-methyl-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase      Benzyl-2-methyl-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a benzyl-2-methyl-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   benzyl (2R,3S)-2-methyl-3-hydroxybutanoate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzyl 2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are benzyl (2R,3S)-2-methyl-3-hydroxybutanoate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are benzyl 2-methyl-3-oxobutanoate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is benzyl-(2R,3S)-2-methyl-3-hydroxybutanoate:NADP + 3-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called benzyl 2-methyl-3-hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase .
