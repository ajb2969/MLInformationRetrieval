   Draft:Normal homomorphism      Draft:Normal homomorphism   In algebra, a normal homorphism is a ring homomorphism    R  →  S     normal-→  R  S    R\to S   that is flat and is such that for any field extension L of the residue field    κ   (  𝔭  )       κ  𝔭    \kappa(\mathfrak{p})   of any prime ideal   𝔭   𝔭   \mathfrak{p}   ,    L   ⊗  R   S      subscript  tensor-product  R   L  S    L\otimes_{R}S   is a normal ring .
