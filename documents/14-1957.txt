   Erdős–Szemerédi theorem      Erdős–Szemerédi theorem   In arithmetic combinatorics , the Erdős–Szemerédi theorem , proven by Paul Erdős and Endre Szemerédi in 1983, 1 states that, for every finite set of real numbers , either the pairwise sums or the pairwise products of the numbers in the set form a significantly larger set. More precisely, it asserts the existence of positive constants c and $\varepsilon$ such that  $$\max( |A+A|, |A \cdot A| ) \geq c |A|^{1+\varepsilon}$$  whenever A is a finite non-empty set of real numbers of cardinality | A |, where $A+A = \{ a+b: a,b \in A \}$ is the sum-set of A with itself, and $A \cdot A = \{ab: a,b \in A\}$ .  It is possible for A + A to be of comparable size to A if A is an arithmetic progression , and it is possible for A · A to be of comparable size to A if A is a geometric progression . The Erdős–Szemerédi theorem can thus be viewed as an assertion that it is not possible for a large set to behave like an arithmetic progression and as a geometric progression simultaneously. It can also be viewed as an assertion that the real line does not contain any set resembling a finite subring or finite subfield; it is the first example of what is now known as the sum-product phenomenon , which is now known to hold in a wide variety of rings and fields, including finite fields. 2  It was conjectured by Erdős and Szemerédi that one can take $\varepsilon$ arbitrarily close to 1. The best result in this direction currently is by Solymosi, 3 who showed that one can take $\varepsilon$ arbitrarily close to 1/3.
