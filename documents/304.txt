   Milne-Thomson circle theorem      Milne-Thomson circle theorem   In fluid dynamics the Milne-Thomson circle theorem or the circle theorem is a statement giving a new stream function for a fluid flow when a cylinder is placed into that flow. 1 2 It was named after the English mathematician L. M. Milne-Thomson .  Let    w  =   f   (  z  )        w    f  z     w=f(z)   be the complex stream function for a fluid flow with no rigid boundaries and no singularities within     |  z  |   =  a        z   a    |z|=a   . If a circular cylinder     |  z  |   =  a        z   a    |z|=a   is placed into that flow, the complex potential for the new flow is given by: 3      w  =    f   (  z  )    +    f   (    a  2    z  ¯    )    ¯    =    f   (  z  )    +    f  ¯    (    a  2   z   )           w      f  z    normal-¯    f     superscript  a  2    normal-¯  z                f  z      normal-¯  f      superscript  a  2   z        w=f(z)+\overline{f\left(\frac{a^{2}}{\bar{z}}\right)}=f(z)+\bar{f}\left(\frac{%
 a^{2}}{{z}}\right)     See also   Potential flow  Conformal mapping  Velocity potential   References  External links  "  Category:Fluid mechanics  Category:Fluid dynamics  Category:Equations of fluid dynamics     ↩  ↩  ↩
