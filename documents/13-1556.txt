   Buckingham potential      Buckingham potential   The Buckingham potential is a formula proposed by Richard Buckingham which describes the Pauli  repulsion energy and van der Waals energy      Φ  12    (  r  )        subscript  normal-Φ  12   r    \Phi_{12}(r)   for the interaction of two atoms that are not directly bonded as a function of the interatomic distance    r   r   r   . It is a variety of interatomic potentials .        Φ  12    (  r  )    =    A   exp   (   -   B  r    )     -   C   r  6            subscript  normal-Φ  12   r       A        B  r        C   superscript  r  6       \Phi_{12}(r)=A\exp\left(-Br\right)-\frac{C}{r^{6}}     Here,   A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   and   C   C   C   are constants. The two terms on the right-hand side constitute a repulsion and an attraction, because their first derivatives with respect to   r   r   r   are negative and positive, respectively.  Buckingham proposed this as a simplification of the Lennard-Jones potential , in a theoretical study of the equation of state for gaseous  helium , neon and argon . 1  As explained in Buckingham's original paper and, e.g., in section 2.2.5 of Jensen's text, 2 the repulsion is due to the interpenetration of the closed electron shells . "There is therefore some justification for choosing the repulsive part (of the potential) as an exponential function ". The Buckingham potential has been used extensively in simulations of molecular dynamics .  Because the exponential term converges to a constant as   r   r   r   →   0   0    , while the    r   -  6      superscript  r    6     r^{-6}   term diverges, the Buckingham potential "turns over" as   r   r   r   becomes small. This may be problematic when dealing with a structure with very short interatomic distances, as the nuclei that cross the turn-over will become strongly (and unphysically) bound to one another at a distance of zero. 3  Coulomb-Buckingham potential  (Figure)  Example Coulomb-Buckingham potential of interaction.   The Coulomb-Buckingham potential is an extension of the Buckingham potential for application to ionic systems (e.g. ceramic materials). The formula for the interaction is:        Φ  12    (  r  )    =     A   exp   (   -   B  r    )     -   C   r  6     +     q  1    q  2     4  π   ε  0   r            subscript  normal-Φ  12   r         A        B  r        C   superscript  r  6          subscript  q  1    subscript  q  2      4  π   subscript  ε  0   r       \Phi_{12}(r)=A\exp\left(-Br\right)-\frac{C}{r^{6}}+\frac{q_{1}q_{2}}{4\pi%
