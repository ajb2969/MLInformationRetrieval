   N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine hydrolase      N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine hydrolase   In enzymology , a N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   benzyl alcohol + CO 2 + glycine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are benzyl alcohol , CO 2 , and glycine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-benzyloxycarbonylglycine urethanehydrolase . Other names in common use include benzyloxycarbonylglycine hydrolase , Nalpha-carbobenzoxyamino acid amidohydrolase , Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl amino acid urethane hydrolase , and Nalpha-benzyloxycarbonyl amino acid urethane hydrolase I . It has 2 cofactors : zinc , and Cobalt .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.1  Category:Zinc enzymes  Category:Cobalt enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
