   F-space      F-space   In functional analysis , an F-space is a vector space  V over the real or complex numbers together with a metric  d : V × V → R so that   Scalar multiplication in V is continuous with respect to d and the standard metric on R or C .  Addition in V is continuous with respect to d .  The metric is translation-invariant ; i.e., d ( x + a , y + a ) = d ( x , y ) for all x , y and a in V  The metric space ( V , d ) is complete   Some authors call these spaces Fréchet spaces , but usually the term is reserved for locally convex F-spaces. The metric may or may not necessarily be part of the structure on an F-space; many authors only require that such a space be metrizable in a manner that satisfies the above properties.  Examples  Clearly, all Banach spaces and Fréchet spaces are F-spaces. In particular, a Banach space is an F-space with an additional requirement that . 1  The L p spaces are F-spaces for all  and for  they are locally convex and thus Fréchet spaces and even Banach spaces.  Example 1       L    1  2      [  0  ,  1  ]        superscript  L    1  2     0  1     \scriptstyle L^{\frac{1}{2}}[0,\,1]   is a F-space. It admits no continuous seminorms and no continuous linear functionals — it has trivial dual space .  Example 2  Let     W  p    (  𝔻  )        subscript  W  p   𝔻    \scriptstyle W_{p}(\mathbb{D})   be the space of all complex valued Taylor series       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  ≥  0      a  n    z  n           f  z     subscript     n  0       subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n       f(z)=\sum_{n\geq 0}a_{n}z^{n}     on the unit disc   𝔻   𝔻   \scriptstyle\mathbb{D}   such that        ∑  n     |   a  n   |   p    <  ∞        subscript   n    superscript     subscript  a  n    p       \sum_{n}|a_{n}|^{p}<\infty     then (for )     W  p    (  𝔻  )        subscript  W  p   𝔻    \scriptstyle W_{p}(\mathbb{D})   are F-spaces under the p-norm :      ∥  f   ∥  p   =   ∑  n   |   a  n    |  p    (  0  <  p  <  1  )      fragments  parallel-to  f   subscript  parallel-to  p     subscript   n   normal-|   subscript  a  n    superscript  normal-|  p   italic-   fragments  normal-(  0   p   1  normal-)     \|f\|_{p}=\sum_{n}|a_{n}|^{p}\qquad(0     In fact,    W  p     subscript  W  p    \scriptstyle W_{p}   is a quasi-Banach algebra . Moreover, for any   ζ   ζ   \scriptstyle\zeta   with     |  ζ  |   ≤  1        ζ   1    \scriptstyle|\zeta|\;\leq\;1   the map     f   ↦   f   (  ζ  )       maps-to  f    f  ζ     \scriptstyle f\,\mapsto\,f(\zeta)   is a bounded linear (multiplicative functional) on     W  p    (  𝔻  )        subscript  W  p   𝔻    \scriptstyle W_{p}(\mathbb{D})   .
