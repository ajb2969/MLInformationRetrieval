F-space




F-space

In functional analysis, an F-space is a vector space V over the real or complex numbers together with a metric d : V × V → R so that

Scalar multiplication in V is continuous with respect to d and the standard metric on R or C.
Addition in V is continuous with respect to d.
The metric is translation-invariant; i.e., d(x + a, y + a) = d(x, y) for all x, y and a in V
The metric space (V, d) is complete

Some authors call these spaces Fréchet spaces, but usually the term is reserved for locally convex F-spaces. The metric may or may not necessarily be part of the structure on an F-space; many authors only require that such a space be metrizable in a manner that satisfies the above properties.
Examples
Clearly, all Banach spaces and Fréchet spaces are F-spaces. In particular, a Banach space is an F-space with an additional requirement that .1
The Lp spaces are F-spaces for all  and for  they are locally convex and thus Fréchet spaces and even Banach spaces.
Example 1


 
  is a F-space. It admits no continuous seminorms and no continuous linear functionals — it has trivial dual space.
Example 2
Let 
 
 
 
  be the space of all complex valued Taylor series



on the unit disc 
 
 
 
  such that



then (for ) 
 
 
 
  are F-spaces under the p-norm:



In fact, 
 
 
 
  is a quasi-Banach algebra. Moreover, for any 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  the map 
 
 
 
  is a bounded linear (multiplicative functional) on 
 
 
 
 .
