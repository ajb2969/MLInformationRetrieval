   Bochner space      Bochner space   In mathematics , Bochner spaces are a generalization of the concept of L p spaces to functions whose values lie in a Banach space which is not necessarily the space R or C of real or complex numbers.  The space L p (X) consists of (equivalence classes of) all Bochner measurable functions f with values in the Banach space X whose norm  ||f|| X lies in the standard L p space. Thus, if X is the set of complex numbers, it is the standard Lebesgue L p space.  Almost all standard results on L p spaces do hold on Bochner spaces too; in particular, the Bochner spaces L p (X) are Banach spaces for    1  ≤  p  ≤  ∞        1  p           1\leq p\leq\infty   .  Background  Bochner spaces are named for the Polish - American  mathematician  Salomon Bochner .  Applications  Bochner spaces are often used in the functional analysis approach to the study of partial differential equations that depend on time, e.g. the heat equation : if the temperature    g   (  t  ,  x  )       g   t  x     g(t,x)   is a scalar function of time and space, one can write      (   f   (  t  )    )    (  x  )    :=   g   (  t  ,  x  )       assign      f  t   x     g   t  x      (f(t))(x):=g(t,x)   to make f a family f(t) (parametrized by time) of functions of space, possibly in some Bochner space.  Definition  Given a measure space ( T , Σ, μ ), a Banach space ( X , || · || X ) and 1 ≤ p ≤ +∞, the Bochner space  L p ( T ; X ) is defined to be the Kolmogorov quotient (by equality almost everywhere ) of the space of all Bochner measurable functions u : T → X such that the corresponding norm is finite:         ∥  u  ∥     L  p    (  T  ;  X  )     :=    (    ∫  T       ∥   u   (  t  )    ∥   X  p    d  μ   (  t  )     )    1  /  p    <   +   ∞  for  1    ≤  p  <  ∞   ,       assign   subscript   norm  u      superscript  L  p    T  X      superscript    subscript   T      superscript   subscript   norm    u  t    X   p   normal-d  μ  t      1  p              for  1         p           \|u\|_{L^{p}(T;X)}:=\left(\int_{T}\|u(t)\|_{X}^{p}\,\mathrm{d}\mu(t)\right)^{1%
 /p}<+\infty\mbox{ for }1\leq p<\infty,            ∥  u  ∥     L  ∞    (  T  ;  X  )     :=    ess    sup   t  ∈  T      ∥   u   (  t  )    ∥   X    <   +  ∞    .       assign   subscript   norm  u      superscript  L     T  X       ess   subscript  sup    t  T     subscript   norm    u  t    X                \|u\|_{L^{\infty}(T;X)}:=\mathrm{ess\,sup}_{t\in T}\|u(t)\|_{X}<+\infty.     In other words, as is usual in the study of L p spaces, L p ( T ; X ) is a space of equivalence classes of functions, where two functions are defined to be equivalent if they are equal everywhere except upon a μ - measure zero subset of T . As is also usual in the study of such spaces, it is usual to abuse notation and speak of a "function" in L p ( T ; X ) rather than an equivalence class (which would be more technically correct).  Application to PDE theory  Very often, the space T is an interval of time over which we wish to solve some partial differential equation, and μ will be one-dimensional Lebesgue measure . The idea is to regard a function of time and space as a collection of functions of space, this collection being parametrized by time. For example, in the solution of the heat equation on a region Ω in R n and an interval of time [0, T ], one seeks solutions      u  ∈    L  2    (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;    H  0  1    (  Ω  )    )        u     superscript  L  2     0  T      superscript   subscript  H  0   1   normal-Ω       u\in L^{2}\left([0,T];H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)\right)   with time derivative         ∂  u    ∂  t    ∈    L  2    (   [  0  ,  T  ]   ;    H   -  1     (  Ω  )    )     .          u     t       superscript  L  2     0  T      superscript  H    1    normal-Ω       \frac{\partial u}{\partial t}\in L^{2}\left([0,T];H^{-1}(\Omega)\right).   Here     H  0  1    (  Ω  )        superscript   subscript  H  0   1   normal-Ω    H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)   denotes the Sobolev  Hilbert space of once- weakly differentiable functions with first weak derivative in L ²(Ω) that vanish at the boundary of Ω (in the sense of trace, or, equivalently, are limits of smooth functions with compact  support in Ω);     H   -  1     (  Ω  )        superscript  H    1    normal-Ω    H^{-1}(\Omega)   denotes the dual space of     H  0  1    (  Ω  )        superscript   subscript  H  0   1   normal-Ω    H_{0}^{1}(\Omega)   .  (The " partial derivative " with respect to time t above is actually a total derivative , since the use of Bochner spaces removes the space-dependence.)
