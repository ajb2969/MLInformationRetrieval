   Impact pressure      Impact pressure   In compressible fluid dynamics, impact pressure (dynamic pressure) is the difference between total pressure (also known as pitot pressure or stagnation pressure ) and static pressure . 1  2 In aerodynamics notation, this quantity is denoted as     q  c     subscript  q  c    q_{c}    or     Q  c     subscript  Q  c    Q_{c}    .  When input to an airspeed indicator, impact pressure is used to provide a calibrated airspeed reading. An air data computer with inputs of pitot and static pressures is able to provide a Mach number and, if static temperature is known, true airspeed .  Some authors in the field of compressible flows use the term dynamic pressure or compressible dynamic pressure instead of impact pressure . 3 4  Isentropic flow  In isentropic flow the ratio of total pressure to static pressure is given by: 5       P  t   P   =    (   1  +     γ  -  1   2    M  2     )     γ   γ  -  1             subscript  P  t   P    superscript    1        γ  1   2    superscript  M  2       γ    γ  1       \frac{P_{t}}{P}=\left(1+\frac{\gamma-1}{2}M^{2}\right)^{\tfrac{\gamma}{\gamma-%
