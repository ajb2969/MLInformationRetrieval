Impact pressure

In compressible fluid dynamics, impact pressure (dynamic pressure) is the difference between total pressure (also known as pitot pressure or stagnation pressure) and static pressure.1 2 In aerodynamics notation, this quantity is denoted as 

 or 

.
When input to an airspeed indicator, impact pressure is used to provide a calibrated airspeed reading. An air data computer with inputs of pitot and static pressures is able to provide a Mach number and, if static temperature is known, true airspeed.
Some authors in the field of compressible flows use the term dynamic pressure or compressible dynamic pressure instead of impact pressure.34
Isentropic flow
In isentropic flow the ratio of total pressure to static pressure is given by:5


where:


 
  is total pressure


 
  is static pressure


 
  is the ratio of specific heats

 
  is the freestream Mach number
Taking 
 
 
 
  to be 1.4, and since 
 
 


Expressing the incompressible dynamic pressure as 
 
 
 
  and expanding by the binomial series gives:



where:


 
  is dynamic pressure
