   Lankford coefficient      Lankford coefficient   The Lankford coefficient (also called Lankford value, R-value, or plastic strain ratio) 1 is a measure of the plastic  anisotropy of a rolled  sheet metal . This scalar quantity is used extensively as an indicator of the formability of recrystallized  low-carbon steel sheets. 2  Definition  If   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   are the coordinate directions in the plane of rolling and   z   z   z   is the thickness direction, then the R-value is given by      R  =    ϵ  xy  p    ϵ  z  p        R   continued-fraction   subscript   superscript  ϵ  p   xy    subscript   superscript  ϵ  p   normal-z      R=\cfrac{\epsilon^{p}_{\mathrm{xy}}}{\epsilon^{p}_{\mathrm{z}}}   where    ϵ  xy  p     subscript   superscript  ϵ  p   xy    \epsilon^{p}_{\mathrm{xy}}   is the plastic strain in-plane and    ϵ  z  p     subscript   superscript  ϵ  p   normal-z    \epsilon^{p}_{\mathrm{z}}   is the plastic strain through-the-thickness.  More recent studies have shown that the R-value of a material can depend strongly on the strain even at small strains  . In practice, the   R   R   R   value is usually measured at 20% elongation in a tensile test .  For sheet metals , the   R   R   R   values are usually determined for three different directions of loading in-plane (     0  ∘   ,   45  ∘   ,   90  ∘       superscript  0     superscript  45     superscript  90      0^{\circ},45^{\circ},90^{\circ}   to the rolling direction ) and the normal R-value is taken to be the average       R  =    1  4    (    R  0   +    2    R  45    +   R  90    )     .      R     continued-fraction  1  4      subscript  R  0     2   subscript  R  45     subscript  R  90       R=\cfrac{1}{4}\left(R_{0}+2~{}R_{45}+R_{90}\right)~{}.     The planar anisotropy coefficient or planar R-value is a measure of the variation of   R   R   R   with angle from the rolling direction. This quantity is defined as        R  p   =    1  2    (     R  0   -    2    R  45     +   R  90    )     .       subscript  R  p      continued-fraction  1  2        subscript  R  0     2   subscript  R  45      subscript  R  90       R_{p}=\cfrac{1}{2}\left(R_{0}-2~{}R_{45}+R_{90}\right)~{}.     Anisotropy of steel sheets  Generally, the Lankford value of cold rolled steel sheet acting for deep-drawability shows heavy orientation, and such deep-drawability is characterized by   R   R   R   . However, in the actual press-working, the deep-drawability of steel sheets cannot be determined only by the value of   R   R   R   and the measure of planar anisotropy,    R  p     subscript  R  p    R_{p}   is more appropriate.  In an ordinary cold rolled steel,    R  90     subscript  R  90    R_{90}   is the highest, and    R  45     subscript  R  45    R_{45}   is the lowest. Experience shows that even if    R  45     subscript  R  45    R_{45}   is close to 1,    R  0     subscript  R  0    R_{0}   and    R  90     subscript  R  90    R_{90}   can be quite high leading to a high average value of   R   R   R   . 3 In such cases, any press-forming process design on the basis of    R  45     subscript  R  45    R_{45}   does not lead to an improvement in deep-drawability.
