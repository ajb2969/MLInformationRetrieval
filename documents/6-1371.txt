   Hadamard space      Hadamard space   In geometry , an Hadamard space , named after Jacques Hadamard , is a non-linear generalization of a Hilbert space . It is defined to be a nonempty 1 complete metric space where, given any points x , y , there exists a point m such that for every point z ,         d    (  z  ,  m  )   2    +    d    (  x  ,  y  )   2    4    ≤     d    (  z  ,  x  )   2    +   d    (  z  ,  y  )   2     2    .          d   superscript   z  m   2        d   superscript   x  y   2    4          d   superscript   z  x   2      d   superscript   z  y   2     2     d(z,m)^{2}+{d(x,y)^{2}\over 4}\leq{d(z,x)^{2}+d(z,y)^{2}\over 2}.     The point m is then the midpoint of x and y      d   (  x  ,  m  )    =   d   (  y  ,  m  )    =    d   (  x  ,  y  )    /  2           d   x  m      d   y  m             d   x  y    2      d(x,m)=d(y,m)=d(x,y)/2   .  In a Hilbert space, the above inequality is equality (with    m  =    (   x  +  y   )   /  2       m      x  y   2     m=(x+y)/2   ), and in general an Hadamard space is said to be flat if the above inequality is equality. A flat Hadamard space is isomorphic to a closed convex subset of a Hilbert space. In particular, a normed space is an Hadamard space if and only if it is a Hilbert space.  The geometry of Hadamard spaces resembles that of Hilbert spaces, making it a natural setting for the study of rigidity theorems . In an Hadamard space, any two points can be joined by a unique geodesic between them; in particular, it is contractible . Quite generally, if B is a bounded subset of a metric space, then the center of the closed ball of the minimum radius containing it is called the circumcenter of B . 2 Every bounded subset of an Hadamard space is contained in the smallest closed ball (which is the same as the closure of its convex hull). If   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is the group of isometries of an Hadamard space leaving invariant B , then   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   fixes the circumcenter of B . ( Bruhat–Tits fixed point theorem )  The basic result for a non-positively curved manifold is the Cartan–Hadamard theorem . The analog holds for an Hadamard space: a complete, connected metric space which is locally isometric to an Hadamard space has an Hadamard space as its universal cover. Its variant applies for non-positively curved orbifolds . (cf. Lurie.)  Examples of Hadamard spaces are Hilbert spaces, the Poincaré disc , trees (e.g., Bruhat–Tits building ), Cayley graphs of hyperbolic groups or more generally CAT(0) groups, ( p , q )-space with p , q ≥ 3 and 2 pq ≥ p + q , and Riemannian manifolds of nonpositive sectional curvature (e.g., symmetric spaces ). An Hadamard space is precisely a complete CAT(0) space .  Applications of Hadamard spaces are not restricted to geometry. In 1998, Dmitry Burago and Serge Ferleger  3 used CAT(0) geometry to solve a problem in Dynamical billiards : in a gas of hard balls, is there a uniform bound on the number of collisions? The solution begins by constructing a configuration space for the dynamical system, obtained by joining together copies of corresponding billiard table, which turns out to be an Hadamard space.
