   3-oxoacid CoA-transferase      3-oxoacid CoA-transferase   In enzymology , a 3-oxoacid CoA-transferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   succinyl-CoA + a 3-oxo acid   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   succinate + a 3-oxoacyl-CoA   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA and 3-oxo acid , whereas its two products are succinate and 3-oxoacyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the CoA-transferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:3-oxo-acid CoA-transferase . Other names in common use include 3-oxoacid coenzyme A-transferase , 3-ketoacid CoA-transferase , 3-ketoacid coenzyme A transferase , 3-oxo-CoA transferase , 3-oxoacid CoA dehydrogenase , acetoacetate succinyl-CoA transferase , acetoacetyl coenzyme A-succinic thiophorase , succinyl coenzyme A-acetoacetyl coenzyme A-transferase , and succinyl-CoA transferase . This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways : synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies , valine, leucine and isoleucine degradation , and butanoate metabolism .  This protein may use the morpheein model of allosteric regulation . 1  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
