   Linear Lie algebra      Linear Lie algebra   In algebra, a linear Lie algebra is a subalgebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   of the Lie algebra     𝔤  𝔩   (  V  )       𝔤  𝔩  V    \mathfrak{gl}(V)   consisting of endomorphisms of a vector space  V . In other words, a linear Lie algebra is the image of a Lie algebra representation .  Any Lie algebra is a linear Lie algebra in the sense that there is always a faithful representation of   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   (in fact, on a finite-dimensional vector space by Ado's theorem if   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is itself finite-dimensional.)  Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero and   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   a subalgebra of    𝔤  𝔩   (  V  )       𝔤  𝔩  V    \mathfrak{gl}(V)   . Then V is semisimple as a module over   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   if and only if (i) it is a direct sum of the center and a semisimple ideal and (ii) the elements of the center are diagonalizable (over some extension field). 1  Notes  References   Jacobson, Nathan, Lie algebras , Republication of the 1962 original.
