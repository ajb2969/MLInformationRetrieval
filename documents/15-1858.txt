Linear Lie algebra

In algebra, a linear Lie algebra is a subalgebra 
 
 
 
  of the Lie algebra

 
  consisting of endomorphisms of a vector space V. In other words, a linear Lie algebra is the image of a Lie algebra representation.
Any Lie algebra is a linear Lie algebra in the sense that there is always a faithful representation of 
 
 
 
  (in fact, on a finite-dimensional vector space by Ado's theorem if 
 
 
 
  is itself finite-dimensional.)
Let V be a finite-dimensional vector space over a field of characteristic zero and 
 
 
 
  a subalgebra of 
 
 
 
 . Then V is semisimple as a module over 
 
 
 
  if and only if (i) it is a direct sum of the center and a semisimple ideal and (ii) the elements of the center are diagonalizable (over some extension field).1
