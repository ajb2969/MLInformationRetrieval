2-Hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase

2-Hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde dehydrogenase (, xylG (gene), praB (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (2E,4Z)-2-hydroxy-6-oxohexa-2,4-dienoate:NAD+ oxidoreductase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2-hydroxymuconate-6-semialdehyde + NAD+ + H2O 
 
 
 
  (2Z,4E)-2-hydroxyhexa-2,4-dienedioate + NADH + 2 H+


This substrate for this enzyme is formed by meta ring cleavage of catechol (EC 1.13.11.2, catechol 2,3-dioxygenase), and is an intermediate in the bacterial degradation of several aromatic compounds.
