Bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase




Bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase

In enzymology, a bile acid-CoA:amino acid N-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

choloyl-CoA + glycine 
 
 
 
  CoA + glycocholate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are choloyl-CoA and glycine, whereas its two products are CoA and glycocholate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is choloyl-CoA:glycine N-choloyltransferase. Other names in common use include glycine-taurine N-acyltransferase, amino acid N-choloyltransferase, BAT, glycine N-choloyltransferase, BACAT, cholyl-CoA glycine-taurine N-acyltransferase, and cholyl-CoA:taurine N-acyltransferase. This enzyme participates in bile acid biosynthesis and taurine and hypotaurine metabolism.
