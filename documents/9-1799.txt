   Heat loss due to linear thermal bridging      Heat loss due to linear thermal bridging    In physics ,     H  T   B       subscript  H  T   B    H_{T}B   is the heat loss due to linear thermal bridging when calculating the energy performance of buildings. It appears in both United Kingdom 1 and Irish 2 methodologies.  Calculation of     H  T   B       subscript  H  T   B    H_{T}B     3  The calculation of the heat loss due to linear thermal bridging is relatively simple, given by the formula below:        H  T   B   =   y   ∑   A   e  x  p             subscript  H  T   B     y     subscript  A    e  x  p        H_{T}B=y\sum A_{exp}     In the formula,    y  =  0.08      y  0.08    y=0.08   if Accredited Construction details used, and    y  =  0.15      y  0.15    y=0.15   otherwise, and    ∑   A   e  x  p         subscript  A    e  x  p      \sum A_{exp}   is the sum of all the exposed areas of the building envelope ,  References  "  Category:Energy economics  Category:Thermodynamic properties     ↩  ↩   ↩
