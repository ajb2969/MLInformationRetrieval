Heat loss due to linear thermal bridging


In physics, 
 
 
 
  is the heat loss due to linear thermal bridging when calculating the energy performance of buildings. It appears in both United Kingdom1 and Irish2 methodologies.
Calculation of

The calculation of the heat loss due to linear thermal bridging is relatively simple, given by the formula below:



In the formula, 
 
 
 
  if Accredited Construction details used, and 
 
 
 
  otherwise, and 
 
 
 
  is the sum of all the exposed areas of the building envelope,
