23S rRNA (guanosine2251-2'-O)-methyltransferase

23S rRNA (guanosine2251-2'-O)-methyltransferase (, rlmB (gene), yifH (gene)) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanosine2251-2'-O-)-methyltransferase.12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanosine2251 in 23S rRNA

S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylguanosine2251 in 23S rRNA
 

The enzyme catalyses the methylation of guanosine2251.
