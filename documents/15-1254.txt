   23S rRNA (guanosine2251-2'-O)-methyltransferase      23S rRNA (guanosine2251-2'-O)-methyltransferase   23S rRNA (guanosine 2251 -2'-O)-methyltransferase (, rlmB (gene) , yifH (gene) ) is an enzyme with system name S-adenosyl-L-methionine:23S rRNA (guanosine 2251 -2'-O-)-methyltransferase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + guanosine 2251 in 23S rRNA    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + 2'-O-methylguanosine 2251 in 23S rRNA   The enzyme catalyses the methylation of guanosine 2251 .
