   Branched-chain-fatty-acid kinase      Branched-chain-fatty-acid kinase   In enzymology , a branched-chain-fatty-acid kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 2-methylpropanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + 2-methylpropanoyl phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 2-methylpropanoate , whereas its two products are ADP and 2-methylpropanoyl phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a carboxy group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:branched-chain-fatty-acid 1-phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called isobutyrate kinase .
