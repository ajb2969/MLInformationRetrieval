   Kunen's inconsistency theorem      Kunen's inconsistency theorem   In set theory , a branch of mathematics, Kunen's inconsistency theorem , proved by , shows that several plausible large cardinal axioms are inconsistent with the axiom of choice .  Some consequences of Kunen's theorem are:   There is no non-trivial elementary embedding of the universe V into itself. In other words, there is no Reinhardt cardinal .  If j is an elementary embedding of the universe V into an inner model M , and λ is the smallest fixed point of j above the critical point κ of j , then M does not contain the set j "λ (the image of j restricted to λ).  There is no ω-huge cardinal .  There is no non-trivial elementary embedding of V λ+2 into itself.   It is not known if Kunen's theorem still holds in ZF (ZFC without the axiom of choice), though  showed that there is no definable elementary embedding from V into V . That is there is no formula J in the language of set theory such that for some parameter p ∈ V for all sets x ∈ V and y ∈ V        j   (  x  )    =  y   ↔   J   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )     .     normal-↔      j  x   y     J   x  y  p      j(x)=y\leftrightarrow J(x,y,p)\,.     Kunen used Morse–Kelley set theory in his proof. If the proof is re-written to use ZFC, then one must add the assumption that replacement holds for formulas involving j . Otherwise one could not even show that j "λ exists as a set. The forbidden set j "λ is crucial to the proof. The proof first shows that it cannot be in M . The other parts of the theorem are derived from that.  See also   Rank-into-rank   References        "  Category:Large cardinals
