Realization (systems)

Realization, in the system theory context refers to a state space model implementing a given input-output behavior. That is, given an input-output relationship, a realization is a quadruple of (time-varying) matrices

 
  such that





 
  with 
 
 
 
 
  describing the input and output of the system at time 
 
 
 
 .
LTI System
For a linear time-invariant system specified by a transfer matrix, 
 
 
 
 , a realization is any quadruple of matrices 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .
Canonical realizations
Any given transfer function which is strictly proper can easily be transferred into state-space by the following approach (this example is for a 4-dimensional, single-input, single-output system)):
Given a transfer function, expand it to reveal all coefficients in both the numerator and denominator. This should result in the following form:


 
 .
The coefficients can now be inserted directly into the state-space model by the following approach:





 
 .
This state-space realization is called controllable canonical form (also known as phase variable canonical form) because the resulting model is guaranteed to be controllable (i.e., because the control enters a chain of integrators, it has the ability to move every state).
The transfer function coefficients can also be used to construct another type of canonical form





 
 .
This state-space realization is called observable canonical form because the resulting model is guaranteed to be observable (i.e., because the output exits from a chain of integrators, every state has an effect on the output).
General System



If we have an input 
 
 
 
 , an output 
 
 
 
 , and a weighting pattern

 
  then a realization is any triple of matrices 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the state-transition matrix associated with the realization.1
System identification
System identification techniques take the experimental data from a system and output a realization. Such techniques can utilize both input and output data (e.g. eigensystem realization algorithm) or can only include the output data (e.g. frequency domain decomposition). Typically an input-output technique would be more accurate, but the input data is not always available.
