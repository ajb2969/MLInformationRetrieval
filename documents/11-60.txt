   Butyrate—CoA ligase      Butyrate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , a butyrate-CoA ligase , also known as -ligase , () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + an acid + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + an acyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , acid , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and acyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is butanoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming). Other names in common use include:   butyryl-CoA synthetase, fatty acid thiokinase (medium chain),  acyl-activating enzyme, fatty acid elongate,  fatty acid activating enzyme,  fatty acyl coenzyme A synthetase,  medium chain acyl-CoA synthetase,  butyryl-coenzyme A synthetase,  L-(+)-3-hydroxybutyryl CoA ligase,  xenobiotic/medium-chain fatty acid ligase, and  short-chain acyl-CoA synthetase.
