   Siegel's lemma      Siegel's lemma   In transcendental  number theory and Diophantine approximation , Siegel's lemma refers to bounds on the solutions of linear equations obtained by the construction of auxiliary functions . The existence of these polynomials was proven by Axel Thue ; 1 Thue's proof used Dirichlet's box principle . Carl Ludwig Siegel published his lemma in 1929. 2 It is a pure existence theorem for a system of linear equations .  Siegel's lemma has been refined in recent years to produce sharper bounds on the estimates given by the lemma. 3  Statement  Suppose we are given a system of M linear equations in N unknowns such that N > M , say         a  11    X  1    +  ⋯  +    a   1  N     X  N     =  0           subscript  a  11    subscript  X  1    normal-⋯     subscript  a    1  N     subscript  X  N     0    a_{11}X_{1}+\cdots+a_{1N}X_{N}=0        ⋯   normal-⋯   \cdots            a   M  1     X  1    +  ⋯  +    a   M  N     X  N     =  0           subscript  a    M  1     subscript  X  1    normal-⋯     subscript  a    M  N     subscript  X  N     0    a_{M1}X_{1}+\cdots+a_{MN}X_{N}=0     where the coefficients are rational integers, not all 0, and bounded by B . The system then has a solution      (   X  1   ,   X  2   ,  …  ,   X  N   )      subscript  X  1    subscript  X  2   normal-…   subscript  X  N     (X_{1},X_{2},\dots,X_{N})     with the X s all rational integers, not all 0, and bounded by        (   N  B   )    M  /   (   N  -  M   )     .     superscript    N  B     M    N  M      (NB)^{M/(N-M)}.\,    4 gave the following sharper bound for the X 's:       max   |   X  j   |    ≤    (    D   -  1      det   (   A   A  T    )      )    1  /   (   N  -  M   )              subscript  X  j      superscript     superscript  D    1          A   superscript  A  T         1    N  M       \max|X_{j}|\leq\left(D^{-1}\sqrt{\det(AA^{T})}\right)^{1/(N-M)}   where D is the greatest common divisor of the M by M minors of the matrix A , and A T is its transpose. Their proof involved replacing the Dirichlet box principle by techniques from the geometry of numbers .  See also   Diophantine approximation   References     Wolfgang M. Schmidt .
