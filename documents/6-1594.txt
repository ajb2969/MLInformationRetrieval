   Finite topology      Finite topology   Finite topology is a mathematical concept which has several different meanings.  Finite topological space  A Finite topological space is a topological space whose underlying set is finite.  In endomorphism rings  If A and B are abelian groups then the finite topology on the group of homomorphisms Hom( A , B ) can be defined using the following base of open neighbourhoods of zero.       U    x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n     =   {   f  ∈   Hom   (  A  ,  B  )     ∣     f   (   x  i   )    =   0  for  i   =  1   ,   2  ,  …  ,  n    }        subscript  U    subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      conditional-set    f   Hom  A  B     formulae-sequence        f   subscript  x  i      0  for  i        1     2  normal-…  n       U_{x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}}=\{f\in\operatorname{Hom}(A,B)\mid f(x_{i})=0\mbox%
