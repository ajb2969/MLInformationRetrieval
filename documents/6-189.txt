   Pascal's rule      Pascal's rule   In mathematics , Pascal's rule is a combinatorial  identity about binomial coefficients . It states that for any natural number  n we have         (      n  -  1       k     )   +   (      n  -  1        k  -  1      )    =   (     n      k     )      for  1   ≤  k  ≤  n      formulae-sequence       binomial    n  1   k    binomial    n  1     k  1      binomial  n  k          for  1   k       n      {n-1\choose k}+{n-1\choose k-1}={n\choose k}\quad\text{for }1\leq k\leq n     where    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {n\choose k}   is a binomial coefficient. This is also commonly written         (     n      k     )   +   (     n       k  -  1      )    =   (      n  +  1       k     )      for  1   ≤  k  ≤   n  +  1       formulae-sequence       binomial  n  k    binomial  n    k  1      binomial    n  1   k          for  1   k         n  1       {n\choose k}+{n\choose k-1}={n+1\choose k}\quad\text{for }1\leq k\leq n+1     Combinatorial proof  Pascal's rule has an intuitive combinatorial meaning. Recall that    (      a      b      )     binomial  a  b    {a\choose b}   counts in how many ways can we pick a subset with b elements out from a set with a elements. Therefore, the right side of the identity    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {n\choose k}   is counting how many ways can we get a k -subset out from a set with n elements.  Now, suppose you distinguish a particular element 'X' from the set with n elements. Thus, every time you choose k elements to form a subset there are two possibilities: X belongs to the chosen subset or not.  If X is in the subset, you only really need to choose k − 1 more objects (since it is known that X will be in the subset) out from the remaining n − 1 objects. This can be accomplished in    (       n  -  1        k  -  1       )     binomial    n  1     k  1     n-1\choose k-1   ways.  When X is not in the subset, you need to choose all the k elements in the subset from the n − 1 objects that are not X . This can be done in    (       n  -  1       k      )     binomial    n  1   k    n-1\choose k   ways.  We conclude that the numbers of ways to get a k -subset from the n -set, which we know is    (      n      k      )     binomial  n  k    {n\choose k}   , is also the number      (       n  -  1        k  -  1       )   +   (       n  -  1       k      )    .       binomial    n  1     k  1     binomial    n  1   k     {n-1\choose k-1}+{n-1\choose k}.

Algebraic proof  We need to show         (     n      k     )   +   (     n       k  -  1      )    =   (      n  +  1       k     )    .         binomial  n  k    binomial  n    k  1      binomial    n  1   k     {n\choose k}+{n\choose k-1}={n+1\choose k}.
