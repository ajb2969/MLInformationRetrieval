Pascal's rule

In mathematics, Pascal's rule is a combinatorial identity about binomial coefficients. It states that for any natural number n we have



where 
 
 
 
  is a binomial coefficient. This is also commonly written



Combinatorial proof
Pascal's rule has an intuitive combinatorial meaning. Recall that 
 
 
 
 
  counts in how many ways can we pick a subset with b elements out from a set with a elements. Therefore, the right side of the identity 
 
 
 
  is counting how many ways can we get a k-subset out from a set with n elements.
Now, suppose you distinguish a particular element 'X' from the set with n elements. Thus, every time you choose k elements to form a subset there are two possibilities: X belongs to the chosen subset or not.
If X is in the subset, you only really need to choose k − 1 more objects (since it is known that X will be in the subset) out from the remaining n − 1 objects. This can be accomplished in 
 
 
 
  ways.
When X is not in the subset, you need to choose all the k elements in the subset from the n − 1 objects that are not X. This can be done in 
 
 
 
  ways.
We conclude that the numbers of ways to get a k-subset from the n-set, which we know is 
 
 
 
 , is also the number
