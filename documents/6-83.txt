Popular mathematics

Popular mathematics is mathematical presentation aimed at a general audience. Sometimes this is in the form of books which require no mathematical background and in other cases it is in the form of expository articles written by professional mathematicians to reach out to others working in different areas.
Books
Some of the most prolific popularisers of mathematics include Keith Devlin, Martin Gardner and Ian Stewart. Titles by these three authors can be found on their respective pages.
On zero




On infinity




On constants






On complex numbers




On the Riemann hypothesis






On recently solved problems
