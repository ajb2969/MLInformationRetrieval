   Fredholm operator      Fredholm operator   In mathematics , a Fredholm operator is an operator that arises in the Fredholm theory of integral equations . It is named in honour of Erik Ivar Fredholm .  A Fredholm operator is a bounded linear operator between two Banach spaces , with finite-dimensional kernel and cokernel , and with closed range . (The last condition is actually redundant. 1 ) Equivalently, an operator T : X ‚Üí Y is Fredholm if it is invertible modulo  compact operators , i.e., if there exists a bounded linear operator      S  :   Y  ‚Üí  X      normal-:  S   normal-‚Üí  Y  X     S:Y\to X     such that        Id  X   -   S  T    and    Id  Y   -   T  S          subscript  Id  X     S  T    and     subscript  Id  Y     T  S      \mathrm{Id}_{X}-ST\quad\text{and}\quad\mathrm{Id}_{Y}-TS     are compact operators on X and Y respectively.  The index of a Fredholm operator is        ind   T   :=    dim   ker  T    -    codim    ran   T       assign    ind  T      dimension   kernel  T      codim  ran  T      \mathrm{ind}\,T:=\dim\ker T-\mathrm{codim}\,\mathrm{ran}\,T   or in other words,         ind   T   :=    dim   ker  T    -    dim    coker   T     ;     assign    ind  T      dimension   kernel  T      dim  coker  T      \mathrm{ind}\,T:=\dim\ker T-\mathrm{dim}\,\mathrm{coker}\,T;   see dimension , kernel , codimension , range, and cokernel.  Properties  The set of Fredholm operators from X to Y is open in the Banach space L( X , Y ) of bounded linear operators, equipped with the operator norm . More precisely, when T 0 is Fredholm from X to Y , there exists Œµ > 0 such that every T in L( X , Y ) with || T ‚àí T 0 || 0.  When T is Fredholm from X to Y and U Fredholm from Y to Z , then the composition    U  ‚àò  T      U  T    U\circ T   is Fredholm from X to Z and        ind   (   U  ‚àò  T   )    =    ind   (  U  )    +   ind   (  T  )      .        ind    U  T        ind  U     ind  T      \mathrm{ind}(U\circ T)=\mathrm{ind}(U)+\mathrm{ind}(T).     When T is Fredholm, the transpose (or adjoint) operator  is Fredholm from  to , and . When X and Y are Hilbert spaces , the same conclusion holds for the Hermitian adjoint  T ‚àó .  When T is Fredholm and K a compact operator, then T + K is Fredholm. The index of T remains unchanged under compact perturbations of T . This follows from the fact that the index i ( s ) of  is an integer defined for every s in [0,¬†1], and i ( s ) is locally constant, hence i (1)¬†= i (0).  Invariance by perturbation is true for larger classes than the class of compact operators. For example, when T is Fredholm and S a strictly singular operator, then T + S is Fredholm with the same index. 2 A bounded linear operator S from X to Y is strictly singular when its restriction to any infinite dimensional subspace X 0 of X fails to be an into isomorphism, that is:       inf   {   ‚à•   S  x   ‚à•   :    x  ‚àà   X  0    ,    ‚à•  x  ‚à•   =  1    }    =   0.        infimum   conditional-set   norm    S  x     formulae-sequence    x   subscript  X  0       norm  x   1      0.    \inf\{\|Sx\|:x\in X_{0},\,\|x\|=1\}=0.\,     Examples  Let H be a Hilbert space with an orthonormal basis { e n } indexed by the non negative integers. The (right) shift operator  S on H is defined by        S   (   e  n   )    =   e   n  +  1     ,   n  ‚â•   0.       formulae-sequence      S   subscript  e  n     subscript  e    n  1       n  0.     S(e_{n})=e_{n+1},\quad n\geq 0.\,     This operator S is injective (actually, isometric) and has a closed range of codimension 1, hence S is Fredholm with ind( S )¬†=¬†‚àí1. The powers S k , k ‚â•¬†0, are Fredholm with index¬†‚àí k . The adjoint S ‚àó is the left shift,         S  *    (   e  0   )    =  0   ,      S  *    (   e  n   )    =   e   n  -  1     ,   n  ‚â•   1.        formulae-sequence       superscript  S     subscript  e  0    0    formulae-sequence       superscript  S     subscript  e  n     subscript  e    n  1       n  1.      S^{*}(e_{0})=0,\ \ S^{*}(e_{n})=e_{n-1},\quad n\geq 1.\,     The left shift S ‚àó is Fredholm with index¬†1.  If H is the classical Hardy space  H 2 ( T ) on the unit circle T in the complex plane, then the shift operator with respect to the orthonormal basis of complex exponentials       e  n   :   e   i  t    ‚àà  ùêì  ‚Üí   e   i  n  t    ,  n  ‚â•  0  ,     fragments   subscript  e  n   normal-:   superscript  normal-e    normal-i  t     T  normal-‚Üí   superscript  normal-e    normal-i  n  t    normal-,  n   0  normal-,    e_{n}:\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}t}\in\mathbf{T}\rightarrow\mathrm{e}^{\mathrm{i}nt%
 },\quad n\geq 0,\,     is the multiplication operator M œÜ with the function œÜ = e 1 . More generally, let œÜ be a complex continuous function on T that does not vanish on T , and let T œÜ denote the Toeplitz operator with symbol œÜ , equal to multiplication by œÜ followed by the orthogonal projection P from L 2 ( T ) onto H 2 ( T ):        T  œÜ   :   f  ‚àà    H  2    (  T  )    ‚Üí   P   (   f  œÜ   )    ‚àà    H  2    (  T  )      .     normal-:   subscript  T  œÜ       f     superscript  H  2   normal-T     normal-‚Üí      P    f  œÜ            superscript  H  2   normal-T       T_{\varphi}:f\in H^{2}(\mathrm{T})\rightarrow P(f\varphi)\in H^{2}(\mathrm{T}).\,     Then T œÜ is a Fredholm operator on H 2 ( T ), with index related to the winding number around 0 of the closed path : the index of T œÜ , as defined in this article, is the opposite of this winding number.  Applications  The Atiyah-Singer index theorem gives a topological characterization of the index of certain operators on manifolds.  An elliptic operator can be extended to a Fredholm operator. The use of Fredholm operators in partial differential equations is an abstract form of the parametrix method.  B-Fredholm operators  For each integer   n   n   n   , define    T  n     subscript  T  n    T_{n}   to be the restriction of   T   T   T   to    R   (   T  n   )       R   superscript  T  n     R(T^{n})   viewed as a map from    R   (   T  n   )       R   superscript  T  n     R(T^{n})   into    R   (   T  n   )       R   superscript  T  n     R(T^{n})   ( in particular     T  0   =  T       subscript  T  0   T    T_{0}=T   ). If for some integer   n   n   n   the space    R   (   T  n   )       R   superscript  T  n     R(T^{n})   is closed and    T  n     subscript  T  n    T_{n}   is a Fredholm operator,then   T   T   T   is called a B-Fredholm operator. The index of a B-Fredholm operator   T   T   T   is defined as the index of the Fredholm operator    T  n     subscript  T  n    T_{n}   . It is shown that the index is independent of the integer   n   n   n   . B-Fredholm operators were introduced by M. Berkani in 1999 as a generalization of Fredholm operators. 3  Notes    References   D.E. Edmunds and W.D. Evans (1987), Spectral theory and differential operators, Oxford University Press.
