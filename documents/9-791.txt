   Trimean      Trimean   In statistics the trimean (TM) , or Tukey's trimean , is a measure of a probability distribution 's location defined as a weighted average of the distribution's median and its two quartiles :       T  M   =     Q  1   +   2   Q  2    +   Q  3    4         T  M        subscript  Q  1     2   subscript  Q  2     subscript  Q  3    4     TM=\frac{Q_{1}+2Q_{2}+Q_{3}}{4}     This is equivalent to the average of the median and the midhinge :       T  M   =    1  2    (    Q  2   +     Q  1   +   Q  3    2    )          T  M       1  2      subscript  Q  2        subscript  Q  1    subscript  Q  3    2       TM=\frac{1}{2}\left(Q_{2}+\frac{Q_{1}+Q_{3}}{2}\right)     The foundations of the trimean were part of Arthur Bowley 's teachings, and later popularized by statistician John Tukey in his 1977 book 1 which has given its name to a set of techniques called Exploratory data analysis .  Like the median and the midhinge, but unlike the sample mean , it is a statistically resistant  L-estimator with a breakdown point of 25%. This beneficial property has been described as follows:  Efficiency  Despite its simplicity, the trimean is a remarkably efficient estimator of population mean. More precisely, for a large data set (over 100 points) from a symmetric population, the average of the 20th, 50th, and 80th percentile is the most efficient 3 point L-estimator, with 88% efficiency. For context, the best 1 point estimate by L-estimators is the median, with an efficiency of 64% or better (for all n ), while using 2 points (for a large data set of over 100 points from a symmetric population), the most efficient estimate is the 29% midsummary (mean of 29th and 71st percentiles), which has an efficiency of about 81%. Using quartiles, these optimal estimators can be approximated by the midhinge and the trimean. Using further points yield higher efficiency, though it is notable that only 3 points are needed for very high efficiency.
