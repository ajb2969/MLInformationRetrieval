   Cass criterion      Cass criterion   The Cass Criterion , also known as the Malinvaud-Cass Criterion , is a central result in theory of overlapping generations models in economics . It is named after David Cass . 1 2  A major feature which sets overlapping generations models in economics apart from the standard model with a finite number of infinitely lived individuals is that the First welfare theorem might not hold, that is competitive equilibria may be not be Pareto optimal .  If    p  t     subscript  p  t    p_{t}   represents the vector of Arrow–Debreu  commodity prices prevailing in period   t   t   t   and if        ∑   t  =  0   ∞    1   ∥   p  t   ∥     <  ∞        superscript   subscript     t  0        1   norm   subscript  p  t         \sum_{t=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{\|p_{t}\|}<\infty   .  then a competitive equilibrium allocation is inefficient . 3  References  "  Category:Economics models     ↩  ↩  [ https://books.google.com/books?id=fYmOO_jdGUYC&pg; ;=PA132&lpg;=PA132&dq;=Cass+criterion&source;=bl&ots;=d2zUVzMSJX&sig;=iJuAUv9UC9W-Kwv-RqU4t1Sg8rM&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=qOpXVartMMbDsAWAnYDgBg&ved;=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q;=Cass%20criterion&f;=false] ↩
