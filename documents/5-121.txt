Dirichlet's principle

In mathematics, and particularly in potential theory, Dirichlet's principle is the assumption that the minimizer of a certain energy functional is a solution to Poisson's equation.
Formal statement
Dirichlet's principle states that, if the function 
 
 
 
  is the solution to Poisson's equation



on a domain

 
  of 
 
 
 
  with boundary condition



then u can be obtained as the minimizer of the Dirichlet's energy



amongst all twice differentiable functions 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
  (provided that there exists at least one function making the Dirichlet's integral finite). This concept is named after the German mathematician Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet.
History
Since the Dirichlet's integral is bounded from below, the existence of an infimum is guaranteed. That this infimum is attained was taken for granted by Riemann (who coined the term Dirichlet's principle) and others until Weierstrass gave an example of a functional that does not attain its minimum. Hilbert later justified Riemann's use of Dirichlet's principle.
