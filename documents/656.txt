   6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase      6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase   In enzymology , a 6-aminohexanoate-cyclic-dimer hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   1,8-diazacyclotetradecane-2,9-dione + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   N-(6-aminohexanoyl)-6-aminohexanoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 1,8-diazacyclotetradecane-2,9-dione and H 2 O , whereas its product is N-(6-aminohexanoyl)-6-aminohexanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 1,8-diazacyclotetradecane-2,9-dione lactamhydrolase .  References     "  Category:EC 3.5.2  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
