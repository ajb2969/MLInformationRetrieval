Square-free word

In combinatorics, a square-free word is a word (a sequence of characters) that does not contain any subword twice in a row.
Thus a square-free word is one that avoids the pattern XX.12
Examples
Over a two-letter alphabet {a, b} the only square-free words are the empty word and a, b, ab, ba, aba, and bab. However, there exist infinite square-free words in any alphabet with three or more symbols,3 as proved by Axel Thue.45
One example of an infinite square-free word over an alphabet of size 3 is the word over the alphabet {0,±1} obtained by taking the first difference of the Thue–Morse sequence.67 That is, from the Thue–Morse sequence

0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, ...
 

one forms a new sequence in which each term is the difference of two consecutive terms of the Thue–Morse sequence. The resulting square-free word is

1, 0, −1, 1, −1, 0, 1, 0, −1, 0, 1, −1, 1, 0, −1, ... .
 

Another example found by John Leech8 is defined recursively over the alphabet {a, b, c}. Let 
 
 
 
  be any word starting with the letter a. Define the words 
 
 
 
  recursively as follows: the word 
 
 
 
  is obtained from 
 
 
 
  by replacing each a in 
 
 
 
  with , each b with , and each c with . It is possible to check that the sequence converges to the infinite square-free word

A cube-free word is one with no occurrence of www for a factor w. The Thue–Morse sequence is an example of a cube-free word over a binary alphabet.9 This sequence is not square-free but is "almost" so: the critical exponent is 2.10 The Thue–Morse sequence has no overlap or overlapping square, instances of 0X0X0 or 1X1X1:11 it is essentially the only infinite binary word with this property.12
The Thue number of a graph G is the smallest number k such that G has a k-coloring for which the sequence of colors along every non-repeating path is squarefree.
