DCTP diphosphatase




DCTP diphosphatase

In enzymology, a dCTP diphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

dCTP + H2O 
 
 
 
  dCMP + diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dCTP and H2O, whereas its two products are dCMP and diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dCTP nucleotidohydrolase. Other names in common use include deoxycytidine-triphosphatase, dCTPase, dCTP pyrophosphatase, deoxycytidine triphosphatase, deoxy-CTPase, and dCTPase. This enzyme participates in pyrimidine metabolism.
