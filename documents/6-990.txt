Minimum degree spanning tree

In graph theory, for a connected graph 
 
 
 
 , a spanning tree

 
  is a subgraph of 
 
 
 
  with the least number of edges that still spans 
 
 
 
 . A number of properties can be proved about 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  is acyclic, has (
 
 
 
 ) edges where 
 
 
 
  is the number of vertices in 
 
 
 
  etc.
A minimum degree spanning tree

 
  is a spanning tree which has the least maximum degree. The vertex of maximum degree in 
 
 
 
  is the least among all possible spanning trees of 
 
 
 
 .
