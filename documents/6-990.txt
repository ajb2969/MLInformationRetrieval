   Minimum degree spanning tree      Minimum degree spanning tree   In graph theory , for a connected graph   G   G   G   , a spanning tree    T   T   T   is a subgraph of   G   G   G   with the least number of edges that still spans   G   G   G   . A number of properties can be proved about   T   T   T   .   T   T   T   is acyclic, has (     |  V  |   -  1        V   1    |V|-1   ) edges where   V   V   V   is the number of vertices in   G   G   G   etc.  A minimum degree spanning tree     T  ′     superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}   is a spanning tree which has the least maximum degree. The vertex of maximum degree in    T  ′     superscript  T  normal-′    T^{\prime}   is the least among all possible spanning trees of   G   G   G   .  See Degree-Constrained Spanning Tree .
