   2-coumarate O-beta-glucosyltransferase      2-coumarate O-beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a 2-coumarate O-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + trans-2-hydroxycinnamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + trans-beta-D-glucosyl-2-hydroxycinnamate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and trans-2-hydroxycinnamate , whereas its two products are UDP and trans-beta-D-glucosyl-2-hydroxycinnamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:trans-2-hydroxycinnamate O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-o-coumarate glucosyltransferase , and UDPG:o-coumaric acid O-glucosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis .  References      "  Category:EC 2.4.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure  Category:Hydroxycinnamic acids metabolism
