   Methylphosphothioglycerate phosphatase      Methylphosphothioglycerate phosphatase   In enzymology , a methylphosphothioglycerate phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-methyl-3-phospho-1-thio-D-glycerate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-methyl-1-thio-D-glycerate + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-methyl-3-phospho-1-thio-D-glycerate and H 2 O , whereas its two products are S-methyl-1-thio-D-glycerate and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-methyl-3-phospho-1-thio-D-glycerate phosphohydrolase . This enzyme is also called methylthiophosphoglycerate phosphatase .
