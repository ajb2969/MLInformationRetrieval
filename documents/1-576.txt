   Kepler's laws of planetary motion      Kepler's laws of planetary motion   In astronomy , Kepler's laws of planetary motion are three scientific laws describing the motion of planets around the Sun .     The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci .  A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. 1  The square of the orbital period of a planet is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.   Most planetary orbits are almost circles, and careful observation and calculation is required in order to establish that they are actually ellipses . Calculations of the orbit of the planet Mars first indicated to Johannes Kepler its elliptical shape, and he inferred that other heavenly bodies, including those farther away from the Sun, also have elliptical orbits.  Kepler's work (published between 1609-1619) improved the heliocentric theory of Nicolaus Copernicus , explaining how the planets' speeds varied, and using elliptical orbits rather than circular orbits with epicycles . 2  Isaac Newton showed in 1687 that relationships like Kepler's would apply in the solar system to a good approximation, as consequences of his own laws of motion and law of universal gravitation .  Kepler's laws are part of the foundation of modern astronomy and physics . 3  Comparison to Copernicus  Kepler's laws improve the model of Copernicus. If the eccentricities of the planetary orbits are taken as zero, then Kepler basically agrees with Copernicus:   The planetary orbit is a circle  The Sun at the center of the orbit  The speed of the planet in the orbit is constant   The eccentricities of the orbits of those planets known to Copernicus and Kepler are small, so the foregoing rules give good approximations of planetary motion; but Kepler's laws fit the observations better than Copernicus's.  Kepler's corrections are not at all obvious:   The planetary orbit is not a circle, but an ellipse .  The Sun is not at the center but at a focal point of the elliptical orbit.  Neither the linear speed nor the angular speed of the planet in the orbit is constant, but the area speed is constant.   The eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth makes the time from the March equinox to the September equinox , around 186 days, unequal to the time from the September equinox to the March equinox, around 179 days. A diameter would cut the orbit into equal parts, but the plane through the sun parallel to the equator of the earth cuts the orbit into two parts with areas in a 186 to 179 ratio, so the eccentricity of the orbit of the Earth is approximately       ε  ≈    π  4     186  -  179    186  +  179     ≈  0.015   ,        ε      π  4       186  179     186  179          0.015     \varepsilon\approx\frac{\pi}{4}\frac{186-179}{186+179}\approx 0.015,   which is close to the correct value (0.016710219) (see Earth's orbit ). The calculation is correct when perihelion , the date the Earth is closest to the Sun, falls on a solstice . The current perihelion, near January 4th, is fairly close to the solstice of December 21 or 22.  Nomenclature  It took nearly two centuries for the current formulation of Kepler's work to take on its settled form. Voltaire 's Eléments de la philosophie de Newton ( Elements of Newton's Philosophy ) of 1738 was the first publication to use the terminology of "laws". Voltaire, [b]Eléments [/b] de la philosophie de Newton [Elements of Newton's Philosophy] (London, England: 1738).

(By one of the great laws of Kepler, each planet describes equal areas in equal times ; by another law no less certain, each planet makes its revolution around the sun in such a way that if its mean distance from the sun is 10, take the cube of that number, which will be 1000, and the time of the revolution of that planet around the sun will be proportional to the square root of that number 1000.)

Kepler had two versions of it, related in a qualitative sense, the "distance law" and the "area law". The "area law" is what became the Second Law in the set of three; but Kepler did himself not privilege it in that way. 8  History  Johannes Kepler published his first two laws about planetary motion in 1609, having found them by analyzing the astronomical observations of Tycho Brahe . 9 10 In his Astronomia nova ... (1609), Kepler did not present his second law in its modern form. He did that only in his Epitome of 1621. Furthermore, in 1609, he presented his second law in two different forms, which scholars call the "distance law" and the "area law".   His "distance law" is presented in: "Caput XXXII. Virtutem quam Planetam movet in circulum attenuari cum discessu a fonte." (Chapter 32. The force that moves a planet circularly weakens with distance from the source.) See: Johannes Kepler, Astronomia nova … (1609), pp. 165–167.  On page 167 , Kepler states: " … , quanto longior est αδ quam αε, tanto diutius moratur Planeta in certo aliquo arcui excentrici apud δ, quam in æquali arcu excentrici apud ε." ( … , as αδ is longer than αε, so much longer will a planet remain on a certain arc of the eccentric near δ than on an equal arc of the eccentric near ε.) That is, the farther a planet is from the Sun (at the point α), the slower it moves along its orbit, so a radius from the Sun to a planet passes through equal areas in equal times. However, as Kepler presented it, his argument is accurate only for circles, not ellipses.  His "area law" is presented in: "Caput LIX. Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … " (Chapter 59. Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … ), Protheorema XIV and XV, pp. 291–295. On the top p. 294, it reads: "Arcum ellipseos, cujus moras metitur area AKN, debere terminari in LK, ut sit AM." (The arc of the ellipse, of which the duration is delimited [i.e., measured] by the area AKM, should be terminated in LK, so that it [i.e., the arc] is AM.) In other words, the time that Mars requires to move along an arc AM of its elliptical orbit is measured by the area of the segment AMN of the ellipse (where N is the position of the Sun), which in turn is proportional to the section AKN of the circle that encircles the ellipse and that is tangent to it. Therefore, the area that is swept out by a radius from the Sun to Mars as Mars moves along an arc of its elliptical orbit is proportional to the time that Mars requires to move along that arc. Thus, a radius from the Sun to Mars sweeps out equal areas in equal times.   In 1621, Kepler restated his second law for any planet: Johannes Kepler, Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz ("Lentiis ad Danubium"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, [ http://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&pg; ;=PA668#v=onepage&q;&f;=true page 668]. From page 668: "Dictum quidem est in superioribus, divisa orbita in particulas minutissimas æquales: accrescete iis moras planetæ per eas, in proportione intervallorum inter eas & Solem." (It has been said above that, if the orbit of the planet is divided into the smallest equal parts, the times of the planet in them increase in the ratio of the distances between them and the sun.) That is, a planet's speed along its orbit is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. (The remainder of the paragraph makes clear that Kepler was referring to what is now called angular velocity.) Kepler's third law was published in 1619. 11 12  Kepler in 1621 and Godefroy Wendelin in 1643 noted that Kepler's third law applies to the four brightest moons of Jupiter . 13 The second law, in the "area law" form, was contested by Nicolaus Mercator in a book from 1664; but by 1670 he was publishing in its favour in Philosophical Transactions , and as the century proceeded it became more widely accepted. 14 The reception in Germany changed noticeably between 1688, the year in which Newton's Principia was published and was taken to be basically Copernican, and 1690, by which time work of Gottfried Leibniz on Kepler had been published. 15  Newton is credited with understanding that the second law is not special to the inverse square law of gravitation, being a consequence just of the radial nature of that law; while the other laws do depend on the inverse square form of the attraction. Carl Runge and Wilhelm Lenz much later identified a symmetry principle in the phase space of planetary motion (the orthogonal group O(4) acting) which accounts for the first and third laws in the case of Newtonian gravitation, as conservation of angular momentum does via rotational symmetry for the second law. 16  Formulary  The mathematical model of the kinematics of a planet subject to the laws allows a large range of further calculations.  First law  (Figure)  Figure 2: Kepler's first law placing the Sun at the focus of an elliptical orbit   (Figure)  Figure 4: Heliocentric coordinate system (r, θ) for ellipse. Also shown are: semi-major axis a , semi-minor axis b and semi-latus rectum p ; center of ellipse and its two foci marked by large dots. For θ = 0°, r = r min and for θ = 180°, r = r max .   Mathematically, an ellipse can be represented by the formula:       r  =   p   1  +    ε    cos  θ       ,      r    p    1    ε    θ        r=\frac{p}{1+\varepsilon\,\cos\theta},   where   p   p   p   is the semi-latus rectum , and ε is the eccentricity of the ellipse, and r is the distance from the Sun to the planet, and θ is the angle to the planet's current position from its closest approach, as seen from the Sun. So ( r , θ ) are polar coordinates .  For an ellipse 0 r_\min=\frac{p}{1+\varepsilon}  At θ = 90° and at θ = 270° the distance is equal to   p   p   p   .  At θ = 180°, aphelion , the distance is maximum (by definition, aphelion is - invariably - perihelion plus 180°)       r  max   =   p   1  -  ε         subscript  r      p    1  ε      r_{\max}=\frac{p}{1-\varepsilon}     The semi-major axis  a is the arithmetic mean between r min and r max :         r   max   -  a   =   a  -   r  min           subscript  r    a     a   subscript  r       \,r_{\max}-a=a-r_{\min}         a  =   p   1  -   ε  2         a    p    1   superscript  ε  2       a=\frac{p}{1-\varepsilon^{2}}     The semi-minor axis  b is the geometric mean between r min and r max :        r  max   b   =   b   r  min           subscript  r    b     b   subscript  r       \frac{r_{\max}}{b}=\frac{b}{r_{\min}}         b  =   p    1  -   ε  2          b    p      1   superscript  ε  2        b=\frac{p}{\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^{2}}}     The semi-latus rectum  p is the harmonic mean between r min and r max :        1   r  min    -   1  p    =    1  p   -   1   r  max             1   subscript  r       1  p        1  p     1   subscript  r        \frac{1}{r_{\min}}-\frac{1}{p}=\frac{1}{p}-\frac{1}{r_{\max}}          p  a   =    r  max    r  min    =    b  2            p  a      subscript  r     subscript  r           superscript  b  2      pa=r_{\max}r_{\min}=b^{2}\,     The eccentricity  ε is the coefficient of variation between r min and r max :       ε  =     r  max   -   r  min      r  max   +   r  min      .      ε       subscript  r     subscript  r        subscript  r     subscript  r        \varepsilon=\frac{r_{\max}-r_{\min}}{r_{\max}+r_{\min}}.     The area of the ellipse is       A  =   π  a   b     .      A    π  a  b     A=\pi ab\,.   The special case of a circle is ε = 0, resulting in r = p = r min = r max = a = b and A = π r 2 .  Second law   (Figure)  The same (blue) area is swept out in a given time. The green arrow is velocity. The purple arrow directed towards the Sun is the acceleration. The other two purple arrows are acceleration components parallel and perpendicular to the velocity.   The orbital radius and angular velocity of the planet in the elliptical orbit will vary. This is shown in the animation: the planet travels faster when closer to the sun, then slower when farther from the sun. Kepler's second law states that the blue sector has constant area.  In a small time    d   t       d  t    dt\,   the planet sweeps out a small triangle having base line    r    r   r\,   and height     r   d  θ      r  d  θ    r\,d\theta   and area     d  A   =     1  2   ⋅  r  ⋅  r   d  θ         d  A      normal-⋅    1  2   r  r   d  θ     dA=\tfrac{1}{2}\cdot r\cdot rd\theta   and so the constant areal velocity is       d  A    d  t    =    1  2    r  2     d  θ    d  t      .          d  A     d  t        1  2    superscript  r  2       d  θ     d  t       \frac{dA}{dt}=\tfrac{1}{2}r^{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}.     The area enclosed by the elliptical orbit is     π  a  b   .      π  a  b    \pi ab.\,   So the period    P    P   P\,   satisfies        P  ⋅    1  2      r  2     d  θ    d  t     =   π  a  b          normal-⋅  P    1  2     superscript  r  2       d  θ     d  t       π  a  b     P\cdot\tfrac{1}{2}r^{2}\frac{d\theta}{dt}=\pi ab   and the mean motion of the planet around the Sun      n  =    2  π   /  P       n      2  π   P     n=2\pi/P   satisfies          r  2    d  θ   =   a  b   n   d  t    .         superscript  r  2   d  θ     a  b  n  d  t     r^{2}\,d\theta=abn\,dt.     Third law  This captures the relationship between the distance of planets from the Sun, and their orbital periods.  For a brief biography of Kepler and discussion of his third law, see: NASA: Stargaze .  Kepler enunciated in 1619 17 this third law in a laborious attempt to determine what he viewed as the " music of the spheres " according to precise laws, and express it in terms of musical notation. 18 So it was known as the harmonic law . 19  Mathematically, the law says that the expression       P  2   /   a  3        superscript  P  2    superscript  a  3     P^{2}/a^{3}   has the same value for all the planets in the solar system. Here P is the time taken for a planet to complete an orbit round the sun, and a is the mean value between the maximum and minimum distances between the planet and sun (i.e. the semimajor axis).  Planetary acceleration   Isaac Newton computed in his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second law.   The direction of the acceleration is towards the Sun.  The magnitude of the acceleration is inversely proportional to the square of the planet's distance from the Sun (the inverse square law ).   This implies that the Sun may be the physical cause of the acceleration of planets.  Newton defined the force acting on a planet to be the product of its mass and the acceleration (see Newton's laws of motion ). So:   Every planet is attracted towards the Sun.  The force acting on a planet is in direct proportion to the mass of the planet and in inverse proportion to the square of its distance from the Sun.   The Sun plays an unsymmetrical part, which is unjustified. So he assumed, in Newton's law of universal gravitation :   All bodies in the solar system attract one another.  The force between two bodies is in direct proportion to the product of their masses and in inverse proportion to the square of the distance between them.   As the planets have small masses compared to that of the Sun, the orbits conform approximately to Kepler's laws. Newton's model improves upon Kepler's model, and fits actual observations more accurately (see two-body problem ).  A deviation in the motion of a planet from Kepler's laws due to gravitational attraction by other planets is called a perturbation .  Below comes the detailed calculation of the acceleration of a planet moving according to Kepler's first and second laws.  Acceleration vector  From the heliocentric point of view consider the vector to the planet    𝐫  =   r   𝐫  ^        𝐫    r   normal-^  𝐫      \mathbf{r}=r\hat{\mathbf{r}}   where   r   r   r   is the distance to the planet and the direction    𝐫  ^     normal-^  𝐫    \hat{\mathbf{r}}   is a unit vector . When the planet moves the directions change:         d   𝐫  ^     d  t    =    𝐫  ^   ˙   =    θ  ˙    𝜽  ^     ,     d   𝜽  ^     d  t    =    𝜽  ^   ˙   =   -    θ  ˙    𝐫  ^         formulae-sequence          d   normal-^  𝐫      d  t     normal-˙   normal-^  𝐫            normal-˙  θ    normal-^  𝜽              d   normal-^  𝜽      d  t     normal-˙   normal-^  𝜽              normal-˙  θ    normal-^  𝐫         \frac{d\hat{\mathbf{r}}}{dt}=\dot{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}=\dot{\theta}\hat{%
 \boldsymbol{\theta}},\qquad\frac{d\hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}}{dt}=\dot{\hat{%
 \boldsymbol{\theta}}}=-\dot{\theta}\hat{\mathbf{r}}   where    𝜽  ^     normal-^  𝜽    \hat{\boldsymbol{\theta}}   is the unit vector orthogonal to    𝐫  ^     normal-^  𝐫    \hat{\mathbf{r}}   and pointing in the direction of rotation, and   θ   θ   \theta   is the polar angle, and where a dot on top of the variable signifies differentiation with respect to time.  So differentiating the position vector twice to obtain the velocity and the acceleration vectors:        𝐫  ˙   =     r  ˙    𝐫  ^    +   r    𝐫  ^   ˙     =     r  ˙    𝐫  ^    +   r   θ  ˙    𝜽  ^      ,         normal-˙  𝐫        normal-˙  r    normal-^  𝐫      r   normal-˙   normal-^  𝐫                normal-˙  r    normal-^  𝐫      r   normal-˙  θ    normal-^  𝜽        \dot{\mathbf{r}}=\dot{r}\hat{\mathbf{r}}+r\dot{\hat{\mathbf{r}}}=\dot{r}\hat{%

This means that the acceleration vector    𝐫  ¨     normal-¨  𝐫    \mathbf{\ddot{r}}   of any planet obeying Kepler's first and second law satisfies the inverse square law       𝐫  ¨   =   -    α   r  2     𝐫  ^          normal-¨  𝐫         α   superscript  r  2     normal-^  𝐫       \mathbf{\ddot{r}}=-\frac{\alpha}{r^{2}}\hat{\mathbf{r}}   where      α  =    n  2     a  3         α     superscript  n  2    superscript  a  3      \alpha=n^{2}a^{3}\,   is a constant, and    𝐫  ^     normal-^  𝐫    \hat{\mathbf{r}}   is the unit vector pointing from the Sun towards the planet, and    r    r   r\,   is the distance between the planet and the Sun.  According to Kepler's third law,   α   α   \alpha   has the same value for all the planets. So the inverse square law for planetary accelerations applies throughout the entire solar system.  The inverse square law is a differential equation . The solutions to this differential equation include the Keplerian motions, as shown, but they also include motions where the orbit is a hyperbola or parabola or a straight line . See Kepler orbit .  Newton's law of gravitation  By Newton's second law , the gravitational force that acts on the planet is:      𝐅  =    m  Planet    𝐫  ¨    =   -    m  Planet   α   r   -  2     𝐫  ^           𝐅     subscript  m  Planet    normal-¨  𝐫              subscript  m  Planet   α   superscript  r    2     normal-^  𝐫        \mathbf{F}=m_{\text{Planet}}\mathbf{\ddot{r}}=-m_{\text{Planet}}\alpha r^{-2}%
 \hat{\mathbf{r}}     where    m  Planet     subscript  m  Planet    m_{\text{Planet}}   is the mass of the planet and   α   α   \alpha   has the same value for all planets in the solar system. According to Newton's third Law , the Sun is attracted to the planet by a force of the same magnitude. Since the force is proportional to the mass of the planet, under the symmetric consideration, it should also be proportional to the mass of the Sun,    m  Sun     subscript  m  Sun    m_{\text{Sun}}   . So      α  =   G   m  Sun        α    G   subscript  m  Sun      \alpha=Gm_{\text{Sun}}     where   G   G   G   is the gravitational constant .  The acceleration of solar system body number i is, according to Newton's laws:        𝐫  ¨   𝐢   =   G    ∑   j  ≠  i      m  j    r   i  j    -  2      𝐫  ^    i  j            subscript   normal-¨  𝐫   𝐢     G    subscript     j  i       subscript  m  j    superscript   subscript  r    i  j      2     subscript   normal-^  𝐫     i  j         \mathbf{\ddot{r}_{i}}=G\sum_{j\neq i}m_{j}r_{ij}^{-2}\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}   where    m  j     subscript  m  j    m_{j}   is the mass of body j ,    r   i  j      subscript  r    i  j     r_{ij}   is the distance between body i and body j ,     𝐫  ^    i  j      subscript   normal-^  𝐫     i  j     \hat{\mathbf{r}}_{ij}   is the unit vector from body i towards body j , and the vector summation is over all bodies in the world, besides i itself.  In the special case where there are only two bodies in the world, Earth and Sun, the acceleration becomes        𝐫  ¨   Earth   =   G   m  Sun    r   Earth  ,  Sun    -  2      𝐫  ^    Earth  ,  Sun          subscript   normal-¨  𝐫   Earth     G   subscript  m  Sun    superscript   subscript  r   Earth  Sun      2     subscript   normal-^  𝐫    Earth  Sun       \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{\text{Earth}}=Gm_{\text{Sun}}r_{\text{Earth},\text{Sun}}^{-%

If the two bodies in the world are Moon and Earth the acceleration of the Moon becomes        𝐫  ¨   Moon   =   G   m  Earth    r   Moon  ,  Earth    -  2      𝐫  ^    Moon  ,  Earth          subscript   normal-¨  𝐫   Moon     G   subscript  m  Earth    superscript   subscript  r   Moon  Earth      2     subscript   normal-^  𝐫    Moon  Earth       \mathbf{\ddot{r}}_{\text{Moon}}=Gm_{\text{Earth}}r_{\text{Moon},\text{Earth}}^%

But Keplerian approximation is the basis for perturbation calculations. See Lunar theory .  Position as a function of time  Kepler used his two first laws to compute the position of a planet as a function of time. His method involves the solution of a transcendental equation called Kepler's equation .  The procedure for calculating the heliocentric polar coordinates ( r , θ ) of a planet as a function of the time t since perihelion , is the following four steps:   1. Compute the mean anomaly  M = nt where n is the mean motion .      n  ⋅  P   =   2  π        normal-⋅  n  P     2  π     n\cdot P=2\pi   radians where P is the period.   2.

Compute the true anomaly  θ by the equation:       (   1  -  ε   )     tan  2    θ  2     =    (   1  +  ε   )     tan  2    E  2             1  ε     superscript   2     θ  2         1  ε     superscript   2     E  2       (1-\varepsilon)\tan^{2}\frac{\theta}{2}=(1+\varepsilon)\tan^{2}\frac{E}{2}      4. Compute the heliocentric distance       r  =   a   (   1  -   ε   cos  E     )     .      r    a    1    ε    E        r=a(1-\varepsilon\cos E).       The important special case of circular orbit, ε = 0, gives θ = E = M . Because the uniform circular motion was considered to be normal , a deviation from this motion was considered an anomaly .

The Keplerian problem assumes an elliptical orbit and the four points:   s the Sun (at one focus of ellipse);  z the perihelion  c the center of the ellipse  p the planet   and        a   =   |   c  z   |    ,      a      c  z      \ a=|cz|,   distance between center and perihelion, the semimajor axis ,        ε   =    |   c  s   |   a    ,      ε        c  s    a     \ \varepsilon={|cs|\over a},   the eccentricity ,        b   =   a    1  -   ε  2       ,      b    a      1   superscript  ε  2        \ b=a\sqrt{1-\varepsilon^{2}},   the semiminor axis ,        r   =   |   s  p   |    ,      r      s  p      \ r=|sp|,   the distance between Sun and planet.       θ  =   ∠  z  s  p    ,      θ    normal-∠  z  s  p     \theta=\angle zsp,   the direction to the planet as seen from the Sun, the true anomaly .  The problem is to compute the polar coordinates ( r , θ ) of the planet from the time since perihelion , t .  It is solved in steps. Kepler considered the circle with the major axis as a diameter, and       x  ,     x   \ x,   the projection of the planet to the auxiliary circle       y  ,     y   \ y,   the point on the circle such that the sector areas |zcy| and |zsx| are equal,       M  =   ∠  z  c  y    ,      M    normal-∠  z  c  y     M=\angle zcy,   the mean anomaly .

See: Johannes Kepler, Astronomia nova … (1609), p. 285. After having rejected circular and oval orbits, Kepler concluded that Mars' orbit must be elliptical. From the top of page 285: "Ergo ellipsis est Planetæ iter; … " (Thus, an ellipse is the planet's [i.e., Mars'] path; … ) Later on the same page: " … ut sequenti capite patescet: ubi simul etiam demonstrabitur, nullam Planetæ relinqui figuram Orbitæ, præterquam perfecte ellipticam; … " ( … as will be revealed in the next chapter: where it will also then be proved that any figure of the planet's orbit must be relinquished, except a perfect ellipse; … ) And then: "Caput LIX. Demonstratio, quod orbita Martis, … , fiat perfecta ellipsis: … " (Chapter 59. Proof that Mars' orbit, … , is a perfect ellipse: … ) The geometric proof that Mars' orbit is an ellipse appears as Protheorema XI on pages 289–290. Kepler stated that all planets travel in elliptical orbits having the Sun at one focus in: Johannes Kepler, Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz ("Lentiis ad Danubium"), (Austria): Johann Planck, 1622), book 5, part 1, III.
