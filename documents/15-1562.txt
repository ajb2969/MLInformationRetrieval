Presqualene diphosphate synthase

Presqualene diphosphate synthase (, SSL-1 (gene)) is an enzyme with system name (2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate:(2E,6E)-farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase (presqualene diphosphate forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

2 (2E,6E)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
presqualene diphosphate + diphosphate
 

This enzyme is isolated from the green alga Botryococcus braunii BOT22.
