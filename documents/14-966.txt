Collisionality

In plasma physics of tokamaks, collisionality is a dimensionless parameter which expresses the ratio of the electron-ion collision frequency to the banana orbit frequency.
Definition
The plasma collisionality 
 
 
 
  is defined as12



where 
 
 
 
  denotes the electron-ion collision frequency, 
 
 
 
  is the plasma major radius, 
 
 
 
  is the inverse aspect-ratio, and 
 
 
 
  is the safety factor. The plasma parameters 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote, respectively, the mass and temperature of the ions, and 
 
 
 
  is the Boltzmann constant.
