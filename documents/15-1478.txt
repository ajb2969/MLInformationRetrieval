   Mannosylglucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase      Mannosylglucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase   Mannosylglucosyl-3-phosphoglycerate synthase (, MggA ) is an enzyme with system name GDP-mannose:2-O-(alpha-D-glucosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate 2-O-alpha-D-mannosyltransferase . 1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   GDP-mannose + 2-O-(alpha-D-glucopyranosyl)-3-phospho-D-glycerate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   GDP + 2-O-[2-O-(alpha-D-mannopyranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-3-phospho-D-glycerate   The enzyme is involved in synthesis of 2-[2-O-(alpha-D-mannopranosyl)-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl]-D-glycerate.
