Griesmer bound

In the mathematics of coding theory, the Griesmer bound, named after James Hugo Griesmer, is a bound on the length of binary codes of dimension k and minimum distance d. There is also a very similar version for non-binary codes.
Statement of the bound
For a binary linear code, the Griesmer bound says:



Proof
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the minimum length of a binary code of dimension k and distance d. Let C be such a code. We want to show that 
 
 
 
 .
Let G be a generator matrix of C. We can always suppose that the first row of G is of the form r = (1, ..., 1, 0, ..., 0) with weight d.



The matrix G' generates a code C', which is called the residual code of C. C' has obviously dimension 
 
 
 
  and length 
 
 
 
 . C' has a distance d', but we don't know it. Let 
 
 
 
  s.t. 
 
 
 
 . There exists a vector 
 
 
 
  s.t. the concatenation 
 
 
 
 . Then 
 
 
 
 . On the other hand, also 
 
 
 
 , since 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is linear, so 
 
 
 
 . But


 
 ,
so this becomes 
 
 
 
 . By summing this with 
 
 
 
 , we obtain 
 
 
 
 . But 
 
 
 
 , so we get 
 
 
 
 . This implies 
 
 
 
 , therefore 
 
 
 
  (due to the integrality of n'), so that 
 
 
 
 . By induction over k we will eventually get 
 
 
 
  (note that at any step the dimension decreases by 1 and the distance is halved, and we use the identity 
 
 
 
  for any integer a and positive integer k).
The bound for the general case
For a linear code over 
 
 
 
 , the Griesmer bound becomes:



The proof is similar to the binary case and so it is omitted.
