   General selection model      General selection model   The General Selection Model (GSM) is a model of population genetics that describes how a population's allele frequencies will change when acted upon by natural selection .  Equation  The General Selection Model applied to a single gene with two alleles (let's call them A1 and A2) is encapsulated by the equation:       Δ  q   =    p  q   [    q   (    W  2   -   W  1    )    +   p   (    W  1   -   W  0    )     ]     W  ¯          normal-Δ  q       p  q   delimited-[]      q     subscript  W  2    subscript  W  1       p     subscript  W  1    subscript  W  0         normal-¯  W      \Delta q=\frac{pq\big[q(W_{2}-W_{1})+p(W_{1}-W_{0})\big]}{\overline{W}}      where:        p   p   p   is the frequency of allele A1     q   q   q   is the frequency of allele A2      Δ  q      normal-Δ  q    \Delta q   is the rate of evolutionary change of the frequency of allele A2       W  0   ,   W  1   ,   W  2       subscript  W  0    subscript  W  1    subscript  W  2     W_{0},W_{1},W_{2}   are the relative fitnesses of homozygous A1, heterozygous (A1A2), and homozygous A2 genotypes respectively.      W  ¯     normal-¯  W    \overline{W}   is the mean population relative fitness.     In words:  The product of the relative frequencies,    p  q      p  q    pq   , is a measure of the genetic variance. The quantity pq is maximized when there is an equal frequency of each gene, when    p  =  q      p  q    p=q   . In the GSM, the rate of change    Δ  Q      normal-Δ  Q    \Delta Q   is proportional to the genetic variation.  The mean population fitness    W  ¯     normal-¯  W    \overline{W}   is a measure of the overall fitness of the population. In the GSM, the rate of change    Δ  Q      normal-Δ  Q    \Delta Q   is inversely proportional to the mean fitness    W  ¯     normal-¯  W    \overline{W}   —i.e. when the population is maximally fit, no further change can occur.  The remainder of the equation,    [    q   (    W  2   -   W  1    )    +   p   (    W  1   -   W  0    )     ]     delimited-[]      q     subscript  W  2    subscript  W  1       p     subscript  W  1    subscript  W  0        \big[q(W_{2}-W_{1})+p(W_{1}-W_{0})\big]   , refers to the mean effect of an allele substitution. In essence, this term quantifies what effect genetic changes will have on fitness.  See also   Darwinian Fitness  Hardy-Weinberg principle  Population genetics   "  Category:Population genetics
