Dihydroxyfumarate decarboxylase

In enzymology, a dihydroxyfumarate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

dihydroxyfumarate 
 
 
 
  tartronate semialdehyde + CO2


Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, dihydroxyfumarate, and two products, tartronate semialdehyde and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dihydroxyfumarate carboxy-lyase (tartronate-semialdehyde-forming). This enzyme is also called dihydroxyfumarate carboxy-lyase. This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
