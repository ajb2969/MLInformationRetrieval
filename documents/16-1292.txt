Droz-Farny line theorem

 In Euclidean geometry, the Droz-Farny line theorem is a property of two perpendicular lines through the orthocenter of an arbitrary triangle.
Let $T$ be a triangle with vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$, and let $H$ be its orthocenter (the common point of its three altitude lines. Let $L_1$ and $L_2$ be any two mutually perpendicular lines through $H$. Let $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ be the points where $L_1$ intersects the side lines $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively. Similarly, let Let $A_2$, $B_2$, and $C_2$ be the points where $L_2$ intersects those side lines. The Droz-Farny line theorem says that the midpoints three segments $A_1A_2$, $B_1B_2$, and $C_1C_2$ are collinear.123
The theorem was stated by Arnold Droz-Farny in 1899,4 but it is not clear whether he had a proof.5
Goormaghtigh's generalization
A generalization of the Droz-Farny line theorem was proved in 1930 by René Goormaghtigh.6
As above, let $T$ be a triangle with vertices $A$, $B$, and $C$. Let $P$ be any point distinct from $A$, $B$, and $C$, and $L$ be any line through $P$. Let $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ be points on the side lines $BC$, $CA$, and $AB$, respectively, such that the lines $PA_1$, $PB_1$, and $PC_1$ are the images of the lines $PA$, $PB$, and $PC$, respectively, by reflection against the line $L$. Goormaghtigh's theorem then says that the points $A_1$, $B_1$, and $C_1$ are collinear.
The Droz-Farny line theorem is a special case of this result, when $P$ is the orthocenter of triangle $T$.
Dao's generalization
The theorem was further generalized by Dao Thanh Oai. The generalization as follows:
Let P be a point on the plane, let three parallel segments AA', BB', CC' such that its midpoints and P are collinear. Then PA', PB', PC' meet BC, CA, AB respectively at three collinear points. 7
