   Fibonorial      Fibonorial   In mathematics , the Fibonorial  n ! F , also called the Fibonacci factorial , where n is a nonnegative integer, is defined as the product of the first n positive Fibonacci numbers , i.e.          n  !   F   :=    ∏   i  =  1   n    F  i     ,    n  ≥  1   ,    and    0  !   F    :=  1     ,     formulae-sequence   assign   subscript    n   F     superscript   subscript  product    i  1    n    subscript  F  i      formulae-sequence    n  1    assign    and   subscript    0   F    1      {n!}_{F}:=\prod_{i=1}^{n}F_{i},\quad n\geq 1,\text{ and }0!_{F}:=1,     where F i is the i th Fibonacci number. (0! F is 1 since it is the empty product .)  The Fibonorial of n ( n ! F ) is defined analogously to the factorial of n ( n !).  The Fibonorial numbers are used in the definition of Fibonomial coefficients (or Fibonacci-binomial coefficients) similarly as the factorial numbers are used in the definition of binomial coefficients .  Almost-Fibonorial numbers  Almost-Fibonorial numbers: n ! F − 1.  It is interesting to look for prime numbers among the almost-Fibonorial numbers , i.e. the almost-Fibonorial primes .  Quasi-Fibonorial numbers  Quasi-Fibonorial numbers: n ! F + 1.  It is interesting to look for prime numbers among the quasi-Fibonorial numbers , i.e. the quasi-Fibonorial primes .  Sequences  Cf.  Product of first n nonzero Fibonacci numbers F (1), ..., F ( n ).  Cf.  and  for n such that n ! F − 1 and n ! F + 1 are primes.
