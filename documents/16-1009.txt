Strichartz estimate

In applied mathematics, Strichartz estimates are a family of inequalities for linear dispersive partial differential equations. These inequalities establish size and decay of solutions in mixed norm Lebesgue spaces. They were first noted by R. Strichartz and arose out of contentions to the Fourier restriction problem.1
Examples
Consider the linear Schrödinger equation with h = m = 1. Then the solution for initial data 
 
 
 
  is given by 
 
 
 
 .
In this case Strichartz estimates take the form:
Suppose Strichartz equation is posed in 
 
 
 
  and let q and r be real numbers satisfying 
 
 
 
 ; 
 
 
 
 ; and 
 
 
 
 . Then the homogeneous Strichartz estimate takes the form:2


 
  Further suppose that 
 
 
 
  satisfy the same restrictions as 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are their dual exponents, then the dual homogeneous Strichartz estimates take the form:3



The inhomogeneous Strichartz estimates are:4
