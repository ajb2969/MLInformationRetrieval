   Kilpatrick limit      Kilpatrick limit   In particle accelerators , a common mechanism for accelerating a charged particle beam is via copper  resonant cavities in which electric and magnetic fields form a standing wave , the mode of which is designed so that the E field points along the axis of the accelerator, producing forward acceleration of the particles when in the correct phase.  The maximum electric field   E   E   E   achievable is limited by a process known as RF breakdown . The reliable limits for various RF frequencies   f   f   f   were tested experimentally in the 1950s by W. D. Kilpatrick. 1  An approximate relation by least-square optimization of the data yields . This form apparently comes from a Los Alamos note:   T. J.
