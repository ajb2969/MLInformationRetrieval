Kilpatrick limit




Kilpatrick limit

In particle accelerators, a common mechanism for accelerating a charged particle beam is via copper resonant cavities in which electric and magnetic fields form a standing wave, the mode of which is designed so that the E field points along the axis of the accelerator, producing forward acceleration of the particles when in the correct phase.
The maximum electric field 
 
 
 
  achievable is limited by a process known as RF breakdown. The reliable limits for various RF frequencies 
 
 
 
  were tested experimentally in the 1950s by W. D. Kilpatrick.1
An approximate relation by least-square optimization of the data yields. This form apparently comes from a Los Alamos note:

T. J. Boyd, Jr., Kilpatrick's criterion, Los Alamos Group AT-1 report AT-1:82-28, February 12, 1982.
 



 
  with 
 
 
 
  (megavolts per metre).
This relation is known as the Kilpatrick Limit.
