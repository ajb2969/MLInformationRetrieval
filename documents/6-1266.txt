   Giuga number      Giuga number   A Giuga number is a composite number  n such that for each of its distinct prime factors  p i we have     p  i   |   (   n   p  i    -  1  )      fragments   subscript  p  i   normal-|   fragments  normal-(    n   subscript  p  i     1  normal-)     p_{i}|({n\over p_{i}}-1)   , or equivalently such that for each of its distinct prime factors  p i we have     p  i  2   |   (  n  -   p  i   )      fragments   superscript   subscript  p  i   2   normal-|   fragments  normal-(  n    subscript  p  i   normal-)     p_{i}^{2}|(n-p_{i})   .  The Giuga numbers are named after the mathematician Giuseppe Giuga , and relate to his conjecture on primality.  Definitions  Alternative definition for a Giuga number due to Takashi Agoh is: a composite number  n is a Giuga number  if and only if the congruence       n   B   φ   (  n  )      ≡    -  1      (   mod  n   )          n   subscript  B    φ  n      annotated    1    pmod  n      nB_{\varphi(n)}\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n)     holds true, where B is a Bernoulli number and    φ   (  n  )       φ  n    \varphi(n)   is Euler's totient function .  An equivalent formulation due to Giuseppe Giuga is: a composite number  n is a Giuga number if and only if the congruence        ∑   i  =  1    n  -  1     i   φ   (  n  )      ≡    -  1      (   mod  n   )          superscript   subscript     i  1      n  1     superscript  i    φ  n      annotated    1    pmod  n      \sum_{i=1}^{n-1}i^{\varphi(n)}\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n)     and if and only if          ∑   p  |  n     1  p    -    ∏   p  |  n     1  p     ∈  ℕ   .          subscript    fragments  p  normal-|  n      1  p      subscript  product   fragments  p  normal-|  n      1  p     ℕ    \sum_{p|n}\frac{1}{p}-\prod_{p|n}\frac{1}{p}\in\mathbb{N}.     All known Giuga numbers n in fact satisfy the stronger condition         ∑   p  |  n     1  p    -    ∏   p  |  n     1  p     =  1.          subscript    fragments  p  normal-|  n      1  p      subscript  product   fragments  p  normal-|  n      1  p     1.    \sum_{p|n}\frac{1}{p}-\prod_{p|n}\frac{1}{p}=1.     Examples  The sequence of Giuga numbers begins   30, 858, 1722, 66198, 2214408306, … .   For example, 30 is a Giuga number since its prime factors are 2, 3 and 5, and we can verify that   30/2 - 1 = 14, which is divisible by 2,  30/3 - 1 = 9, which is 3 squared, and  30/5 - 1 = 5, the third prime factor itself.   Properties  The prime factors of a Giuga number must be distinct. If    p  2     superscript  p  2    p^{2}   divides   n   n   n   , then it follows that      n  p   -  1   =   m  -  1           n  p   1     m  1     {n\over p}-1=m-1   , where    m  =   n  /  p       m    n  p     m=n/p   is divisible by   p   p   p   . Hence,    m  -  1      m  1    m-1   would not be divisible by   p   p   p   , and thus   n   n   n   would not be a Giuga number.  Thus, only square-free integers can be Giuga numbers. For example, the factors of 60 are 2, 2, 3 and 5, and 60/2 - 1 = 29, which is not divisible by 2. Thus, 60 is not a Giuga number.  This rules out squares of primes, but semiprimes cannot be Giuga numbers either. For if    n  =    p  1    p  2        n     subscript  p  1    subscript  p  2      n=p_{1}p_{2}   , with     n   p  2    -  1        n   subscript  p  2    1    {n\over p_{2}}-1   will not divide   n   n   n   , and thus    n  =    ∏  i    p  i        n    subscript  product  i    subscript  p  i      n=\prod_{i}{p_{i}}   is not a Giuga number.  All known Giuga numbers are even. If an odd Giuga number exists, it must be the product of at least 14 primes . It is not known if there are infinitely many Giuga numbers.  It has been conjectured by Paolo P. Lava (2009) that Giuga numbers are the solutions of the differential equation n' = n+1 , where ''n' '' is the arithmetic derivative of n . (For square-free numbers     n  ′   =    ∑  i    n   p  i          superscript  n  normal-′     subscript   i     n   subscript  p  i       n^{\prime}=\sum_{i}\frac{n}{p_{i}}   , $n' = \sum_i \frac{n}{p_i}$ , so n' = n+1 is just the last equation in the above section Definitions , multiplied by n .)  José Mª Grau and Antonio Oller-Marcén have shown that an integer n is a Giuga number if and only if it satisfies n' = a n + 1 for some integer a > 0, where ''n' '' is the arithmetic derivative of n . (Again, n' = a n + 1 is identical to the third equation in Definitions , multiplied by n .)
