Correlation function (quantum field theory)

In quantum field theory, the (real space) n-point correlation function is defined as the functional average (functional expectation value) of a product of 
 
 
field operators at different positions



For time-dependent correlation functions, the time-ordering operator

 
  is included.
Correlation functions are also called simply correlators. Sometimes, the phrase Green's function is used not only for two-point functions, but for any correlators.
