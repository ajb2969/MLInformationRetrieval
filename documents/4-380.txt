   Correlation function (quantum field theory)      Correlation function (quantum field theory)   In quantum field theory , the ( real space ) n -point correlation function is defined as the functional average (functional expectation value) of a product of   n   n   n    field operators at different positions        C  n    (   x  1   ,   x  2   ,  …  ,   x  n   )    :=   ⟨   ϕ   (   x  1   )   ϕ   (   x  2   )   …  ϕ   (   x  n   )    ⟩   =    ∫   D   ϕ    e   -   S   [  ϕ  ]      ϕ   (   x  1   )   …  ϕ   (   x  n   )      ∫   D   ϕ    e   -   S   [  ϕ  ]              assign     subscript  C  n     subscript  x  1    subscript  x  2   normal-…   subscript  x  n      delimited-⟨⟩    ϕ   subscript  x  1   ϕ   subscript  x  2   normal-…  ϕ   subscript  x  n                D  ϕ   superscript  e      S   delimited-[]  ϕ      ϕ   subscript  x  1   normal-…  ϕ   subscript  x  n         D  ϕ   superscript  e      S   delimited-[]  ϕ            C_{n}(x_{1},x_{2},\ldots,x_{n}):=\left\langle\phi(x_{1})\phi(x_{2})\ldots\phi(%

 }{\int D\phi\;e^{-S[\phi]}}     For time-dependent correlation functions, the time-ordering operator    T   T   T   is included.  Correlation functions are also called simply correlators . Sometimes, the phrase Green's function is used not only for two-point functions, but for any correlators.
