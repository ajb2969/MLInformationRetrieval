Schatten norm

In mathematics, specifically functional analysis, the Schatten norm (or Schatten–von-Neumann norm) arises as a generalization of p-integrability similar to the trace class norm and the Hilbert–Schmidt norm.
Definition
Let 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  be separable Hilbert spaces, and 
 
 
 
  a (linear) bounded operator from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 
 
 , define the Schatten p-norm of 
 
 
 
  as



for 
 
 
 
  the singular values of 
 
 
 
 , i.e. the eigenvalues of the Hermitian matrix 
 
 
 
 . From functional calculus on the positive operator T * T it follows that



Properties
In the following we formally extend the range of 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . The dual index to 
 
 
 
  is then 
 
 
 
 .

The Schatten norms are isometrically invariant: for isometries 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ,





They satisfy Hölder's inequality: for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and operators 
 
 
 
  defined between Hilbert spaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively,





Sub-multiplicativity: For all 
 
 
 
  and operators 
 
 
 
  defined between Hilbert spaces 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  respectively,





Monotonicity: For

Duality: Let 
 
 
 
  be finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , then




where 
 
 
 
  denotes the Hilbert-Schmidt inner product.
Remarks
Notice that 
 
 
 
  is the Hilbert–Schmidt norm (see Hilbert–Schmidt operator) and 
 
 
 
  is the trace class norm (see trace class).
For 
 
 
 
  the function 
 
 
 
  is an example of a quasinorm.
An operator which has a finite Schatten norm is called a Schatten class operator and the space of such operators is denoted by 
 
 
 
 . With this norm, 
 
 
 
  is a Banach space, and a Hilbert space for p = 2.
Observe that 
 
 
 
 , the algebra of compact operators. This follows from the fact that if the sum is finite the spectrum will be finite or countable with the origin as limit point, and hence a compact operator (see compact operator on Hilbert space).
