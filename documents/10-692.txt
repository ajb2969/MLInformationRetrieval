   (R)-4-hydroxyphenyllactate dehydrogenase      (R)-4-hydroxyphenyllactate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a (R)-4-hydroxyphenyllactate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)pyruvate , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (R)-3-(4-hydroxyphenyl)lactate:NAD(P) + 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include (R)-aromatic lactate dehydrogenase , and D-hydrogenase, D-aryllactate . This enzyme participates in tyrosine and phenylalanine catabolism.
