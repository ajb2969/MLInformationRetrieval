   Cunningham function      Cunningham function   In statistics , the Cunningham function or Pearson–Cunningham function ω m , n ( x ) is a generalisation of a special function introduced by  and studied in the form here by . It can be defined in terms of the confluent hypergeometric function  U , by         ω   m  ,  n     (  x  )    =     e    -  x   +   π  i   (    m  /  2   -  n   )       Γ   (    1  +  n   -   m  /  2    )     U   (    m  /  2   -  n   ,   1  +  m   ,  x  )     .         subscript  ω   m  n    x        superscript  e      x     π  i      m  2   n        normal-Γ      1  n     m  2      U       m  2   n     1  m   x      \displaystyle\omega_{m,n}(x)=\frac{e^{-x+\pi i(m/2-n)}}{\Gamma(1+n-m/2)}U(m/2-%
 n,1+m,x).     The function was studied by Cunningham 1 in the context of a multivariate generalisation of the Edgeworth expansion for approximating a probability density function based on its (joint) moments . In a more general context, the function is related to the solution of the constant-coefficient diffusion equation , in one or more dimensions. 2  The function ω m , n ( x ) is a solution of the differential equation for X : 3        x   X  ′′    +    (   x  +  1  +  m   )    X  ′    +    (   n  +     1  2    m   +  1   )   X    .        x   superscript  X  ′′        x  1  m    superscript  X  normal-′        n      1  2   m   1   X     xX^{\prime\prime}+(x+1+m)X^{\prime}+(n+\tfrac{1}{2}m+1)X.     The special function studied by Pearson is given, in his notation by, 4         ω   2  n     (  x  )    =    ω   0  ,  n     (  x  )     .         subscript  ω    2  n    x      subscript  ω   0  n    x     \omega_{2n}(x)=\omega_{0,n}(x).
