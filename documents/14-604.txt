   CGHS model      CGHS model   The Callan–Giddings–Harvey–Strominger model or CGHS 1 in short is a toy model of general relativity in 1 spatial and 1 time dimension. General relativity is a highly nonlinear model, and as such, its 3+1D version is usually too complicated to analyze in detail. In 3+1D and higher, propagating gravitational waves exist, but not in 2+1D or 1+1D. In 2+1D, general relativity becomes a topological field theory with no local degrees of freedom, and all 1+1D models are locally flat . However, a slightly more complicated generalization of general relativity which includes dilatons will turn the 2+1D model into one admitting mixed propagating dilaton-gravity waves, as well as making the 1+1D model geometrically nontrivial locally. 2 3 The 1+1D model still does not admit any propagating gravitational (or dilaton) degrees of freedom, but with the addition of matter fields, it becomes a simplified, but still nontrivial model. With other numbers of dimensions, a dilaton-gravity coupling can always be rescaled away by a conformal rescaling of the metric, converting the Jordan frame to the Einstein frame . But not in two dimensions, because the conformal weight of the dilaton is now 0. The metric in this case is more amenable to analytical solutions than the general 3+1D case. And of course, 0+1D models cannot capture any nontrivial aspect of relativity because there is no space at all.  This class of models retains just enough complexity to include among its solutions black holes , their formation, FRW cosmological models, gravitational singularities , etc. In the quantized version of such models with matter fields, Hawking radiation also shows up, just as in higher-dimensional models.  Action  A very specific choice of couplings and interactions leads to the CGHS model.      S  =    1   2  π     ∫    d  2    x     -  g     {     e   -   2  ϕ      [   R  +   4    (   ∇  ϕ   )   2    +   4   λ  2     ]    -    ∑   i  =  1   N     1  2     (   ∇   f  i    )   2      }          S      1    2  π         superscript  d  2   x      g          superscript  e      2  ϕ      delimited-[]    R    4   superscript   normal-∇  ϕ   2      4   superscript  λ  2         subscript   superscript   N     i  1        1  2    superscript   normal-∇   subscript  f  i    2            S=\frac{1}{2\pi}\int d^{2}x\,\sqrt{-g}\left\{e^{-2\phi}\left[R+4\left(\nabla%
 \phi\right)^{2}+4\lambda^{2}\right]-\sum^{N}_{i=1}\frac{1}{2}\left(\nabla f_{i%
 }\right)^{2}\right\}   where g is the metric tensor , φ is the dilaton field, f i are the matter fields, and λ 2 is the cosmological constant . In particular, the cosmological constant is nonzero, and the matter fields are massless real scalars.  This specific choice is classically integrable , but still not amenable to an exact quantum solution. It is also the action for Non-critical string theory and dimensional reduction of higher-dimensional model. It also distinguishes it from Jackiw–Teitelboim gravity and Liouville gravity , which are entirely different models.  The matter field only couples to the causal structure , and in the light-cone gauge − e 2ρ du,dv}} , has the simple generic form        f  i    (  u  ,  v  )    =     A  i    (  u  )    +    B  i    (  v  )            subscript  f  i    u  v         subscript  A  i   u      subscript  B  i   v      f_{i}\left(u,v\right)=A_{i}\left(u\right)+B_{i}\left(v\right)   , with a factorization between left- and right-movers.  The Raychaudhuri equations are         e   -   2  ϕ      (    -   2   ϕ   ,  v  v      +   4   ρ   ,  v     ϕ   ,  v      )    +     f   i  ,  v     f   i  ,  v     /  2    =  0           superscript  e      2  ϕ           2   subscript  ϕ   fragments  normal-,  v  v        4   subscript  ρ   fragments  normal-,  v     subscript  ϕ   fragments  normal-,  v            subscript  f   i  v     subscript  f   i  v     2    0    e^{-2\phi}\left(-2\phi_{,vv}+4\rho_{,v}\phi_{,v}\right)+f_{i,v}f_{i,v}/2=0   and         e   -   2  ϕ      (    -   2   ϕ   ,  u  u      +   4   ρ   ,  u     ϕ   ,  u      )    +     f   i  ,  u     f   i  ,  u     /  2    =  0           superscript  e      2  ϕ           2   subscript  ϕ   fragments  normal-,  u  u        4   subscript  ρ   fragments  normal-,  u     subscript  ϕ   fragments  normal-,  u            subscript  f   i  u     subscript  f   i  u     2    0    e^{-2\phi}\left(-2\phi_{,uu}+4\rho_{,u}\phi_{,u}\right)+f_{i,u}f_{i,u}/2=0   . The dilaton evolves according to        (   e   -   2  ϕ     )    ,  u  v    =   -    λ  2    e   -   2  ϕ      e   2  ρ           subscript   superscript  e      2  ϕ      fragments  normal-,  u  v         superscript  λ  2    superscript  e      2  ϕ      superscript  e    2  ρ        \left(e^{-2\phi}\right)_{,uv}=-\lambda^{2}e^{-2\phi}e^{2\rho}   , while the metric evolves according to         2   ρ   ,  u  v     -   4   ϕ   ,  u  v      +   4   ϕ   ,  u     ϕ   ,  v     +    λ  2    e   2  ρ      =  0            2   subscript  ρ   fragments  normal-,  u  v       4   subscript  ϕ   fragments  normal-,  u  v        4   subscript  ϕ   fragments  normal-,  u     subscript  ϕ   fragments  normal-,  v        superscript  λ  2    superscript  e    2  ρ      0    2\rho_{,uv}-4\phi_{,uv}+4\phi_{,u}\phi_{,v}+\lambda^{2}e^{2\rho}=0   .  The conformal anomaly due to matter induces a Liouville term in the effective action .  Black hole  A vacuum black hole solution is given by       d   s  2    =   -     (    M  λ   -    λ  2   u  v    )    -  1    d   u   d  v          d   superscript  s  2         superscript      M  λ      superscript  λ  2   u  v      1    d  u  d  v      ds^{2}=-\left(\frac{M}{\lambda}-\lambda^{2}uv\right)^{-1}du\,dv          e   -   2  ϕ     =    M  λ   -    λ  2   u  v         superscript  e      2  ϕ         M  λ      superscript  λ  2   u  v      e^{-2\phi}=\frac{M}{\lambda}-\lambda^{2}uv   , where M is the ADM mass. Singularities appear at λ −3 M}} .  The masslessness of the matter fields allow a black hole to completely evaporate away via Hawking radiation . In fact, this model was originally studied to shed light upon the black hole information paradox .
