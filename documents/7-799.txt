   Distribution constant      Distribution constant   The distribution constant (or partition ratio ) ( K D ), is the equilibrium constant for the distribution of an analyte in two immiscible  solvents . 1  In chromatography , for a particular solvent, it is equal to the ratio of its molar concentration in the stationary phase to its molar concentration in the mobile phase , also approximating the ratio of the solubility of the solvent in each phase.  The term is often confused with partition coefficient or distribution coefficient .  Expression  The ratio of activities of a solute , A in an aqueous / organic system will remain constant and independent of the total quantity of A (hence      [  A  ]    o  r  g    ∝    [  A  ]    a  q       proportional-to   subscript   delimited-[]  A     o  r  g     subscript   delimited-[]  A     a  q      [A]_{org}\propto[A]_{aq}   ), so at any given temperature:        (   K  D   )   A   =     (   a  A   )    o  r  g      (   a  A   )    a  q     ≈     [  A  ]    o  r  g      [  A  ]    a  q            subscript   subscript  K  D   A      subscript    a  A     o  r  g     subscript   subscript  a  A     a  q             subscript   delimited-[]  A     o  r  g     subscript   delimited-[]  A     a  q        (K_{D})_{A}={(aA)_{org}\over(a_{A})_{aq}}\approx{[A]_{org}\over[A]_{aq}}     Distribution constants are useful as they allow the calculation of the concentration of remaining analyte in the solution, even after a number of solvent extractions have occurred. They also provide guidance in choosing the most efficient way to conduct an extractive separation .  Thus, the concentration of A remaining in an aqueous solution after i extractions with an organic solvent can be found using:        [  A  ]   i   =     (    V   a  q       V   o  r  g     K  D    +   V   a  q      )   i     [  A  ]   0         subscript   delimited-[]  A   i      superscript     subscript  V    a  q         subscript  V    o  r  g     subscript  K  D     subscript  V    a  q      i    subscript   delimited-[]  A   0      [A]_{i}=({V_{aq}\over V_{org}K_{D}+V_{aq}})^{i}[A]_{0}     (where [A] i is the concentration of A remaining after extracting V aq  millilitres of solution with the original concentration of [A] 0 with i portions of the organic solvent, each with a volume of V org ).
