   Darboux's theorem      Darboux's theorem   Darboux's theorem is a theorem in the mathematical field of differential geometry and more specifically differential forms , partially generalizing the Frobenius integration theorem . It is a foundational result in several fields, the chief among them being symplectic geometry . The theorem is named after Jean Gaston Darboux 1 who established it as the solution of the Pfaff problem. 2  One of the many consequences of the theorem is that any two symplectic manifolds of the same dimension are locally symplectomorphic to one another. That is, every 2 n -dimensional symplectic manifold can be made to look locally like the linear symplectic space  C n with its canonical symplectic form. There is also an analogous consequence of the theorem as applied to contact geometry .  Statement and first consequences  The precise statement is as follows. 3 Suppose that θ is a differential 1-form on an n dimensional manifold, such that dθ has constant rank  p . If   θ ∧ (dθ) p = 0 everywhere,   then there is a local system of coordinates x 1 ,..., x n - p , y 1 , ..., y p in which   θ = x 1 d y 1 + ... + x p d y p .   If, on the other hand,   θ ∧ (dθ) p ≠ 0 everywhere,   then there is a local system of coordinates x 1 ,..., x n - p , y 1 , ..., y p in which   θ = x 1 d y 1 + ... + x p d y p + d x p +1 .   In particular, suppose that ω is a symplectic 2-form on an n =2 m dimensional manifold M . In a neighborhood of each point p of M , by the Poincaré lemma , there is a 1-form θ with dθ=ω. Moreover, θ satisfies the first set of hypotheses in Darboux's theorem, and so locally there is a coordinate chart  U near p in which   θ = x 1 d y 1 + ... + x m d y m .   Taking an exterior derivative now shows   ω = dθ = d x 1 ∧ d y 1 + ... + d x m ∧ d y m .   The chart U is said to be a Darboux chart around p . 4 The manifold M can be covered by such charts.  To state this differently, identify R 2m with C m by letting z j = x j + i y j . If φ : U → C n is a Darboux chart, then ω is the pullback of the standard symplectic form ω 0 on C n :       ω  =    ϕ  *    ω  0     .      ω     superscript  ϕ     subscript  ω  0      \omega=\phi^{*}\omega_{0}.\,     Comparison with Riemannian geometry  This result implies that there are no local invariants in symplectic geometry: a Darboux basis can always be taken, valid near any given point. This is in marked contrast to the situation in Riemannian geometry where the curvature is a local invariant, an obstruction to the metric being locally a sum of squares of coordinate differentials.  The difference is that Darboux's theorem states that ω can be made to take the standard form in an entire neighborhood around p . In Riemannian geometry, the metric can always be made to take the standard form at any given point, but not always in a neighborhood around that point.
