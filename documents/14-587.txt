Erdős distinct distances problem




Erdős distinct distances problem
In [[discrete geometry]], the Erdős distinct distances problem states that between $n$ distinct points on a plane there are at least  distinct distances. It was posed by Paul Erdős in 1946. In a 2010 preprint, Larry Guth and Nets Hawk Katz announced a solution.1
The conjecture
In what follows let $g ( n )$ denote the minimal number of distinct distances between $n$ points in the plane. In his 1946 paper, Erdős proved the estimates $\sqrt{n-3/4}-1/2\leq g(n)\leq c n/\sqrt{\log n}$ for some constant $c$. The lower bound was given by an easy argument, the upper bound is given by a $\sqrt{n}\times\sqrt{n}$ square grid (as there are $O( n/\sqrt{\log n})$ numbers below n which are sums of two squares, see Landau–Ramanujan constant). Erdős conjectured that the upper bound was closer to the true value of g(n), specifically, $g(n) = \Omega(n^c)$ holds for every $c .
Partial results
Paul Erdős' 1946 lower bound of  was successively improved to:

 (Leo Moser, 1952),
 (Fan Chung, 1984),
 (Fan Chung, Endre Szemerédi, W. T. Trotter, 1992),
 (László Székely, 1993),
 (József Solymosi, C. D. Tóth, 2001),
 (Gábor Tardos, 2003),
 (Nets Hawk Katz, Gábor Tardos, 2004),
$ g ( n ) = Ω( n /log n )$ (Larry Guth, Nets Hawk Katz, 2010).

Higher dimensions
Erdős also considered the higher-dimensional variant of the problem: for d≥3 let gd(n) denote the minimal possible number of distinct distances among n point in the d-dimensional Euclidean space. He proved that  and  and conjectured that the upper bound is in fact sharp, i.e.,  . In 2008, Solymosi and Vu obtained the  lower bound.
