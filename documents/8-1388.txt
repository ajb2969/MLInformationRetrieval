Base flow (random dynamical systems)

In mathematics, the base flow of a random dynamical system is the dynamical system defined on the "noise" probability space that describes how to "fast forward" or "rewind" the noise when one wishes to change the time at which one "starts" the random dynamical system.
Definition
In the definition of a random dynamical system, one is given a family of maps 
 
 
 
  on a probability space 
 
 
 
 . The measure-preserving dynamical system

 
  is known as the base flow of the random dynamical system. The maps 
 
 
 
  are often known as shift maps since they "shift" time. The base flow is often ergodic.
The parameter 
 
 
 
  may be chosen to run over



 
  (a two-sided continuous-time dynamical system);


 
  (a one-sided continuous-time dynamical system);


 
  (a two-sided discrete-time dynamical system);


 
  (a one-sided discrete-time dynamical system).

Each map 
 
 
 
  is required

to be a 
 
 
 
 -measurable function: for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 

to preserve the measure 
 
 
 
 : for all 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 .

Furthermore, as a family, the maps 
 
 
 
  satisfy the relations



 
 , the identity function on 
 
 
 
 ;


 
  for all 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for which the three maps in this expression are defined. In particular, 
 
 
 
  if 
 
 
 
  exists.

In other words, the maps 
 
 
 
  form a commutative monoid (in the cases 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) or a commutative group (in the cases 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ).
Example
In the case of random dynamical system driven by a Wiener process

 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is the two-sided classical Wiener space, the base flow 
 
 
 
  would be given by


 
 .
This can be read as saying that 
 
 
 
  "starts the noise at time 
 
 
 
  instead of time 0".
