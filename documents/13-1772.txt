   Local Tate duality      Local Tate duality   In Galois cohomology , local Tate duality (or simply local duality ) is a duality for Galois modules for the absolute Galois group of a non-archimedean local field . It is named after John Tate who first proved it. It shows that the dual of such a Galois module is the Tate twist of usual linear dual. This new dual is called the ( local ) Tate dual .  Local duality combined with Tate's local Euler characteristic formula provide a versatile set of tools for computing the Galois cohomology of local fields.  Statement  Let K be a non-archimedean local field, let K s denote a separable closure of K , and let G K = Gal( K s / K ) be the absolute Galois group of K .  Case of finite modules  Denote by μ the Galois module of all roots of unity in K s . Given a finite G K -module A (of order prime to the characteristic of K ), the Tate dual of A is defined as       A  ′   =   Hom   (  A  ,  μ  )         superscript  A  normal-′     Hom   A  μ      A^{\prime}=\mathrm{Hom}(A,\mu)   (i.e. it is the Tate twist of the usual dual A ∗ ). Let H i ( K , A ) denote the group cohomology of G K with coefficients in A . The theorem states that the pairing          H  i    (  K  ,  A  )    ×   H   2  -  i      (  K  ,   A  ′   )    →    H  2    (  K  ,  μ  )    =   𝐐  /  𝐙        normal-→         superscript  H  i    K  A     superscript  H    2  i      K   superscript  A  normal-′        superscript  H  2    K  μ           𝐐  𝐙      H^{i}(K,A)\times H^{2-i}(K,A^{\prime})\rightarrow H^{2}(K,\mu)=\mathbf{Q}/%
 \mathbf{Z}     given by the cup product sets up a duality between H i ( K , A ) and H 2− i ( K , A ′ ) for i = 0, 1, 2. 1 Since G K has cohomological dimension equal to two, the higher cohomology groups vanish. 2  Case of p -adic representations  Let p be a prime number . Let Q p (1) denote the p -adic cyclotomic character of G K (i.e. the Tate module of μ). A p -adic representation of G K is a continuous  representation      ρ  :    G  K   →   GL   (  V  )        normal-:  ρ   normal-→   subscript  G  K     GL  V      \rho:G_{K}\rightarrow\mathrm{GL}(V)   where V is a finite-dimensional  vector space over the p-adic numbers  Q p and GL( V ) denotes the group of invertible linear maps from V to itself. 3 The Tate dual of V is defined as       V  ′   =   Hom   (  V  ,    𝐐  p    (  1  )    )         superscript  V  normal-′     Hom   V     subscript  𝐐  p   1       V^{\prime}=\mathrm{Hom}(V,\mathbf{Q}_{p}(1))   (i.e. it is the Tate twist of the usual dual V ∗ = Hom( V , Q p )). In this case, H i ( K , V ) denotes the continuous group cohomology of G K with coefficients in V . Local Tate duality applied to V says that the cup product induces a pairing          H  i    (  K  ,  V  )    ×   H   2  -  i      (  K  ,   V  ′   )    →    H  2    (  K  ,    𝐐  p    (  1  )    )    =   𝐐  p        normal-→         superscript  H  i    K  V     superscript  H    2  i      K   superscript  V  normal-′        superscript  H  2    K     subscript  𝐐  p   1           subscript  𝐐  p      H^{i}(K,V)\times H^{2-i}(K,V^{\prime})\rightarrow H^{2}(K,\mathbf{Q}_{p}(1))=%
