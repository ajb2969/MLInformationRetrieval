   Concurrence (quantum computing)      Concurrence (quantum computing)   In quantum information science , the concurrence is a state invariant involving qubits.  Definition  the concurrence is an entanglement monotone defined for a mixed state of two qubits as: 1 2 3 4       𝒞   (  ρ  )    ≡   max   (  0  ,    λ  1   -   λ  2   -   λ  3   -   λ  4    )          𝒞  ρ     0     subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2    subscript  λ  3    subscript  λ  4       \mathcal{C}(\rho)\equiv\max(0,\lambda_{1}-\lambda_{2}-\lambda_{3}-\lambda_{4})     in which     λ  1   ,  …  ,   λ  4       subscript  λ  1   normal-…   subscript  λ  4     \lambda_{1},...,\lambda_{4}   are the eigenvalues, in decreasing order, of the Hermitian matrix      R  =     ρ    ρ  ~    ρ         R        ρ    normal-~  ρ     ρ       R=\sqrt{\sqrt{\rho}\tilde{\rho}\sqrt{\rho}}     with       ρ  ~   =    (    σ  y   ⊗   σ  y    )    ρ  *    (    σ  y   ⊗   σ  y    )         normal-~  ρ      tensor-product   subscript  σ  y    subscript  σ  y     superscript  ρ     tensor-product   subscript  σ  y    subscript  σ  y       \tilde{\rho}=(\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y})\rho^{*}(\sigma_{y}\otimes\sigma_{y})   the spin-flipped state of   ρ   ρ   \rho   ,    σ  y     subscript  σ  y    \sigma_{y}   a Pauli spin matrix , and the eigenvalues listed in decreasing order.  Other formulations  Alternatively, the    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   's represent the square roots of the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian matrix    ρ   ρ  ~       ρ   normal-~  ρ     \rho\tilde{\rho}   . 5 Note that each    λ  i     subscript  λ  i    \lambda_{i}   is a non-negative real number. From the concurrence, the entanglement of formation can be calculated.  Properties  For pure states, the concurrence is a polynomial    S  L    (  2  ,  ℂ  )     ⊗  2        S  L   superscript   2  ℂ    tensor-product  absent  2      SL(2,\mathbb{C})^{\otimes 2}   invariant in the state's coefficients. 6 For mixed states, the concurrence can be defined by convex roof extension . 7  For the concurrence, there is monogamy of entanglement, 8 9 that is, the concurrence of a qubit with the rest of the system cannot ever exceed the sum of the concurrences of qubit pairs which it is part of.
