Concurrence (quantum computing)

In quantum information science, the concurrence is a state invariant involving qubits.
Definition
the concurrence is an entanglement monotone defined for a mixed state of two qubits as:1234



in which 
 
 
 
  are the eigenvalues, in decreasing order, of the Hermitian matrix



with


 
  the spin-flipped state of 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  a Pauli spin matrix, and the eigenvalues listed in decreasing order.
Other formulations
Alternatively, the 
 
 
 
 's represent the square roots of the eigenvalues of the non-Hermitian matrix 
 
 
 
 .5 Note that each 
 
 
 
  is a non-negative real number. From the concurrence, the entanglement of formation can be calculated.
Properties
For pure states, the concurrence is a polynomial 
 
 
 
  invariant in the state's coefficients.6 For mixed states, the concurrence can be defined by convex roof extension.7
For the concurrence, there is monogamy of entanglement,89 that is, the concurrence of a qubit with the rest of the system cannot ever exceed the sum of the concurrences of qubit pairs which it is part of.
