   Gauss' Method      Gauss' Method   In orbital mechanics (subfield of celestial mechanics ), Gauss' method is used for preliminary orbit determination from at least three observations (more observations increases the accuracy of the determined orbit) of the orbiting body of interest at three different times. The required information are the times of observations, the position vectors of the observation points (in Equatorial Coordinate System ), the direction cosine vector of the orbiting body from the observation points (from Topocentric Equatorial Coordinate System) and general physical data.  Carl Friedrich Gauss developed important mathematical techniques (summed up in Gauss' methods) which were specifically used to determine the orbit of Ceres . The method shown following is the orbit determination of an orbiting body about the focal body where the observations were taken from, whereas the method for determining Ceres' orbit requires a bit more effort because the observations were taken from Earth while Ceres orbits the Sun .  Observer position vector  The observer position vector (in Equatorial Coordinate System) of the observation points can be determined from the latitude and local sidereal time (from Topocentric Coordinate System) at the surface of the focal body of the orbiting body ( e.g. , Earth) via either:       𝐑  𝐧   =     [     R  e     1  -    (    2  f   -   f  2    )     sin  2    ϕ  n        +   H  n    ]    cos   ϕ  n     (    cos    θ  n    𝐈  ^     +   sin    θ  n    𝐉  ^      )    +    [      R  e     (   1  -  f   )   2      1  -    (    2  f   -   f  2    )     sin  2    ϕ  n        +   H  n    ]    sin    ϕ  n    𝐊  ^            subscript  𝐑  𝐧        delimited-[]       subscript  R  e       1        2  f    superscript  f  2      superscript   2    subscript  ϕ  n         subscript  H  n        subscript  ϕ  n           subscript  θ  n    normal-^  𝐈          subscript  θ  n    normal-^  𝐉          delimited-[]         subscript  R  e    superscript    1  f   2        1        2  f    superscript  f  2      superscript   2    subscript  ϕ  n         subscript  H  n          subscript  ϕ  n    normal-^  𝐊         \mathbf{R_{n}}=\left[{R_{e}\over\sqrt{1-(2f-f^{2})\sin^{2}\phi_{n}}}+H_{n}%

However, a brief explanation will be given to provide an idea of the derivation process. The initial derivation begins with vector addition to determine the orbiting body's position vector. Then based on the conservation of angular momentum and Keplerian orbit principles (which states that an orbit lies in a two dimensional plane in three dimensional space), a linear combination of said position vectors is established. Also, the relation between a body's position and velocity vector by Lagrange coefficients is used which results in the use of said coefficients. Then with vector manipulation and algebra, the following equations were derived. For detailed derivation, refer to Curtis. 1 NOTE: Gauss' method is a preliminary orbit determination, with emphasis on preliminary. The approximation of the Lagrange coefficients and the limitations of the required observation conditions (i.e., insignificant curvature in the arc between observations, refer to Gronchi 2 for more details) causes inaccuracies. There are ways of increasing the accuracy of Gauss' method such as increasing the accuracy of the Lagrange coefficients. This can be done by solving the universal Kepler's equation . Another way to increase the accuracy is through more observations. There are techniques/methods available that can be used but why not use Gauss' own method, least squares method (still popularly used today).
