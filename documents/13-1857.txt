Polynomial (hyperelastic model)

The ' polynomial' hyperelastic material model 1 is a phenomenological model of rubber elasticity. In this model, the strain energy density function is of the form of a polynomial in the two invariants 
 
 
 
  of the left Cauchy-Green deformation tensor.
The strain energy density function for the polynomial model is 2


 
  where 
 
 
 
  are material constants and 
 
 
 
 .
For compressible materials, a dependence of volume is added


 
  where



In the limit where 
 
 
 
 , the polynomial model reduces to the Neo-Hookean solid model. For a compressible Mooney-Rivlin material
