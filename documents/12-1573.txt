   Bode's sensitivity integral      Bode's sensitivity integral   Bode's sensitivity integral , discovered by Hendrik Wade Bode , is a formula that quantifies some of the limitations in feedback control of linear parameter invariant systems. Let L be the loop transfer function and S be the sensitivity function. Then the following holds:        ∫  0  ∞    ln    |   S   (   i  ω   )    |   d  ω     =    ∫  0  ∞    ln    |   1   1  +   L   (   i  ω   )      |   d  ω     =    π   ∑   R  e   (   p  k   )      -    π  2     lim   s  →  ∞     s  L   (  s  )               superscript   subscript   0             S    i  ω     d  ω       superscript   subscript   0             1    1    L    i  ω       d  ω              π      R  e   subscript  p  k          π  2     subscript    normal-→  s       s  L  s         \int_{0}^{\infty}\ln|S(i\omega)|d\omega=\int_{0}^{\infty}\ln\left|\frac{1}{1+L%
 (i\omega)}\right|d\omega=\pi\sum Re(p_{k})-\frac{\pi}{2}\lim_{s\rightarrow%
 \infty}sL(s)     where    p  k     subscript  p  k    p_{k}   are the poles of L in the right half plane (unstable poles).  If L has at least two more poles than zeros , and has no poles in the right half plane (is stable), the equation simplifies to:        ∫  0  ∞    ln    |   S   (   i  ω   )    |   d  ω     =  0        superscript   subscript   0             S    i  ω     d  ω     0    \int_{0}^{\infty}\ln|S(i\omega)|d\omega=0     This equality shows that if sensitivity to disturbance is suppressed at some frequency range, it is necessarily increased at some other range. This has been called the "waterbed effect." 1  References  Further reading   Karl Johan Åström and Richard M. Murray. Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers .
