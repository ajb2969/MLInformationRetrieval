   Affine hull      Affine hull   In mathematics , the affine hull of a set  S in Euclidean space  R n is the smallest affine set containing S , or equivalently, the intersection of all affine sets containing S . Here, an affine set may be defined as the translation of a vector subspace .  The affine hull aff( S ) of S is the set of all affine combinations of elements of S , that is,        aff   (  S  )    =   {    ∑   i  =  1   k     α  i    x  i     |    k  >  0   ,     x  i   ∈  S   ,     α  i   ∈  ℝ   ,     ∑   i  =  1   k    α  i    =  1      }    .       aff  S    conditional-set    superscript   subscript     i  1    k      subscript  α  i    subscript  x  i      formulae-sequence    k  0    formulae-sequence     subscript  x  i   S    formulae-sequence     subscript  α  i   ℝ       superscript   subscript     i  1    k    subscript  α  i    1         \operatorname{aff}(S)=\left\{\sum_{i=1}^{k}\alpha_{i}x_{i}\Bigg|k>0,\,x_{i}\in
 S%
 ,\,\alpha_{i}\in\mathbb{R},\,\sum_{i=1}^{k}\alpha_{i}=1\right\}.     Examples   The affine hull of a singleton (a set made of one single point) is the singleton itself.  The affine hull of a set of two different points is the line through them.  The affine hull of a set of three points not on one line is the plane going through them.  The affine hull of a set of four points not in a plane in R 3 is the entire space R 3 .   Properties        aff   (   aff   (  S  )    )    =   aff   (  S  )          aff    aff  S      aff  S     \mathrm{aff}(\mathrm{aff}(S))=\mathrm{aff}(S)         aff   (  S  )       aff  S    \mathrm{aff}(S)   is a closed set   Related sets   If instead of an affine combination one uses a convex combination , that is one requires in the formula above that all    α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   be non-negative, one obtains the convex hull of S , which cannot be larger than the affine hull of S as more restrictions are involved.  The notion of conical combination gives rise to the notion of the conical hull  If however one puts no restrictions at all on the numbers    α  i     subscript  α  i    \alpha_{i}   , instead of an affine combination one has a linear combination , and the resulting set is the linear span of S , which contains the affine hull of S .
