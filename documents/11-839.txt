   Acridone synthase      Acridone synthase   In enzymology , an acridone synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3 malonyl-CoA + N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4 CoA + 1,3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone + 3 CO 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA , whereas its 3 products are CoA , 1,3-dihydroxy-N-methylacridone , and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:N-methylanthraniloyl-CoA malonyltransferase (cyclizing) . This enzyme participates in acridone alkaloid biosynthesis .
