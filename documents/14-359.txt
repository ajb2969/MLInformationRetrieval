   Black-oil equations      Black-oil equations   The black-oil equations are a set of partial differential equations that describe fluid flow in a petroleum reservoir , constituting the mathematical framework for a black-oil reservoir simulator . 1  The term black-oil refers to the fluid model, in which water is modeled explicitly together with two hydrocarbon components, one (pseudo) oil phase and one (pseudo-)gas phase.  This is in contrast with a compositional formulation, in which each hydrocarbon component (arbitrary number) is handled separately  The equations of an extended black-oil model are         ∂   ∂  t     [   ϕ   (     S  o    B  o    +     R  V    S  g     B  g     )    ]    +   ∇  ⋅   (     1   B  o      u  →   o    +     R  V    B  g      u  →   g     )     =  0               t     delimited-[]    ϕ       subscript  S  o    subscript  B  o         subscript  R  V    subscript  S  g     subscript  B  g         normal-⋅  normal-∇        1   subscript  B  o     subscript   normal-→  u   o         subscript  R  V    subscript  B  g     subscript   normal-→  u   g       0    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\phi\left(\frac{S_{o}}{B_{o}}+\frac{R_{V}S_{g%
 }}{B_{g}}\right)\right]+\nabla\cdot\left(\frac{1}{B_{o}}\vec{u}_{o}+\frac{R_{V%
 }}{B_{g}}\vec{u}_{g}\right)=0            ∂   ∂  t     [   ϕ   (    S  w    B  w    )    ]    +   ∇  ⋅   (    1   B  w      u  →   w    )     =  0               t     delimited-[]    ϕ     subscript  S  w    subscript  B  w        normal-⋅  normal-∇      1   subscript  B  w     subscript   normal-→  u   w      0    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\phi\left(\frac{S_{w}}{B_{w}}\right)\right]+%
 \nabla\cdot\left(\frac{1}{B_{w}}\vec{u}_{w}\right)=0            ∂   ∂  t     [   ϕ   (      R  S    S  o     B  o    +    S  g    B  g     )    ]    +   ∇  ⋅   (      R  S    B  o      u  →   o    +    1   B  g      u  →   g     )     =  0               t     delimited-[]    ϕ         subscript  R  S    subscript  S  o     subscript  B  o       subscript  S  g    subscript  B  g         normal-⋅  normal-∇         subscript  R  S    subscript  B  o     subscript   normal-→  u   o        1   subscript  B  g     subscript   normal-→  u   g       0    \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left[\phi\left(\frac{R_{S}S_{o}}{B_{o}}+\frac{S_{g%

 1}{B_{g}}\vec{u}_{g}\right)=0   where   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   is a porosity of the porous medium,    S  w     subscript  S  w    S_{w}   is a water saturation,     S  o   ,   S  g       subscript  S  o    subscript  S  g     S_{o},S_{g}   are saturations of liquid ("oil") and vapor ("gas") phases in the reservoir ,      u  →   o   ,    u  →   w   ,    u  →   g       subscript   normal-→  u   o    subscript   normal-→  u   w    subscript   normal-→  u   g     \vec{u}_{o},\vec{u}_{w},\vec{u}_{g}   are Darcy velocities of the liquid phase, water phase and vapor phase in the reservoir. The oil and gas at the surface ( standard conditions ) could be produced from both liquid and vapor phases existing at high pressure and temperature of reservoir conditions. This is characterized by the following quantities:      B  o     subscript  B  o    B_{o}   is an oil formation volume factor (ratio of some volume of reservoir liquid to the volume of oil at standard conditions obtained from the same volume of reservoir liquid),      B  w     subscript  B  w    B_{w}   is a water formation volume factor (ratio of volume of water at reservoir conditions to volume of water at standard conditions),      B  g     subscript  B  g    B_{g}   is a gas formation volume factor (ratio of some volume of reservoir vapor to the volume of gas at standard conditions obtained from the same volume of reservoir vapor),      R  S     subscript  R  S    R_{S}   is a solution of gas in oil phase (ratio of volume of gas to the volume of oil at standard conditions obtained from some amount of liquid phase at reservoir conditions),      R  V     subscript  R  V    R_{V}   is a vaporized oil in gas phase (ratio of volume of oil to the volume of gas at standard conditions obtained from some amount of vapor phase at reservoir conditions).
