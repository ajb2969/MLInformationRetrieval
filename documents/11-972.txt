Polysialic-acid O-acetyltransferase




Polysialic-acid O-acetyltransferase

In enzymology, a polysialic-acid O-acetyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

acetyl-CoA + an alpha-2,8-linked polymer of sialic acid 
 
 
 
  CoA + polysialic acid acetylated on O-7 or O-9
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acetyl-CoA and alpha-2,8-linked polymer of sialic acid, whereas its 3 products are CoA, polysialic acid acetylated on O-7, and polysialic acid acetylated on O-9.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acetyl-CoA:polysialic-acid O-acetyltransferase. Other names in common use include lecithin:retinol acyltransferase, lecithin-retinol acyltransferase, retinyl ester synthase, LRAT, and lecithin retinol acyl transferase.
