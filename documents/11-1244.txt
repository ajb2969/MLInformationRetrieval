Flavanone 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase




Flavanone 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a flavanone 7-O-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + a flavanone 
 
 
 
  UDP + a flavanone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and flavanone, whereas its two products are UDP and flavanone 7-O-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:flavanone 7-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. Other names in common use include uridine diphosphoglucose-flavanone 7-O-glucosyltransferase, naringenin 7-O-glucosyltransferase, and hesperetin 7-O-glucosyl-transferase.
