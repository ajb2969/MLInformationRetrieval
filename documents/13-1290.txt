Atiyah conjecture

In Mathematics, the Atiyah conjecture is a collective term for a number of statements about restrictions on possible values of 

 
 -Betti numbers.
History
In 1976 Michael Atiyah introduced 

 
  -cohomology of manifolds with a free co-compact action of a discrete countable group (e.g. the universal cover of a compact manifold together with the action of the fundamental group by deck transformations.) Atiyah defined also 
 
 
 
 
 -Betti numbers as von Neumann dimensions of the resulting 
 
 
 
 -cohomology groups, and computed several examples, which all turned out to be rational numbers. He therefore asked if it is possible for 
 
 
 
 -Betti numbers to be irrational.
Since then, various researchers asked more refined questions about possible values of 
 
 
 
 -Betti numbers, all of which are customarily referred to as "Atiyah conjecture".
Results
Many positive results were proven by Peter Linnell. For example, if the group acting is a free group, then the 
 
 
 
 -Betti numbers are integers.
The most general question open as of late 2011 is whether 
 
 
 
 
 -Betti numbers are rational if there is a bound on the orders of finite subgroups of the group which acts. In fact, a precise relationship between possible denominators and the orders in question is conjectured; in the case of torsion-free groups this statement generalizes the zero-divisors conjecture. For a discussion see the article of B. Eckmann.
In the case there is no such bound, Tim Austin showed in 2009 that 
 
 
 
 -Betti numbers can assume transcendental values. Later it was shown that in that case they can be any non-negative real numbers.
