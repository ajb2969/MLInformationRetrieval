Aquacobalamin reductase

Aquacobalamin reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2 cob(II)alamin + NAD+

 
  2 aquacob(III)alamin + NADH + H+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cob(II)alamin and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide ion, whereas its 3 products are aquacob(III)alamin, nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, and hydrogen ion.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those oxidizing metal ion with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is cob(II)alamin:NAD+ oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include aquocobalamin reductase, vitamin B12a reductase, NADH-linked aquacobalamin reductase, B12a reductase, and NADH2:cob(III)alamin oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in porphyrin and chlorophyll metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
