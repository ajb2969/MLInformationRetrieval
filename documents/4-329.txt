Trinomial expansion

In mathematics, a trinomial expansion is the expansion of a power of a sum of three terms into monomials. The expansion is given by



where 
 
 
 
  is a nonnegative integer and the sum is taken over all combinations of nonnegative indices 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 .1 The trinomial coefficients are given by



This formula is a special case of the multinomial formula for 
 
 
 
 . The coefficients can be defined with a generalization of Pascal's triangle to three dimensions, called Pascal's pyramid or Pascal's tetrahedron.2
The number of terms of an expanded trinomial is the triangular number



where 
 
 
 
  is the exponent to which the trinomial is raised.3
