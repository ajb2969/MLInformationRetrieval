   Trinomial expansion      Trinomial expansion   In mathematics , a trinomial expansion is the expansion of a power of a sum of three terms into monomials . The expansion is given by         (   a  +  b  +  c   )   n   =    ∑     i  +  j  +  k   =  n    i  ,  j  ,  k        (     n       i  ,  j  ,  k      )      a  i      b   j      c  k      ,       superscript    a  b  c   n     subscript    superscript      i  j  k   n    i  j  k        binomial  n   i  j  k     superscript  a  i    superscript  b  j    superscript  c  k       (a+b+c)^{n}=\sum_{\stackrel{i,j,k}{i+j+k=n}}{n\choose i,j,k}\,a^{i}\,b^{\;\!j}%
 \;\!c^{k},     where   n   n   n   is a nonnegative integer and the sum is taken over all combinations of nonnegative indices     i  ,  j   ,     i  j    i,j,   and   k   k   k   such that     i  +  j  +  k   =  n        i  j  k   n    i+j+k=n   . 1 The trinomial coefficients are given by        (     n       i  ,  j  ,  k      )   =     n  !     i  !    j  !    k  !       .       binomial  n   i  j  k        n       i     j     k       {n\choose i,j,k}=\frac{n!}{i!\,j!\,k!}\,.     This formula is a special case of the multinomial formula for    m  =  3      m  3    m=3   . The coefficients can be defined with a generalization of Pascal's triangle to three dimensions, called Pascal's pyramid or Pascal's tetrahedron. 2  The number of terms of an expanded trinomial is the triangular number        t   n  +  1    =     (   n  +  2   )    (   n  +  1   )    2    ,       subscript  t    n  1          n  2     n  1    2     t_{n+1}=\frac{(n+2)(n+1)}{2},     where   n   n   n   is the exponent to which the trinomial is raised. 3  See also   Binomial expansion  Pascal's pyramid  Multinomial coefficient  Trinomial triangle   References  "  Category:Factorial and binomial topics     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩
