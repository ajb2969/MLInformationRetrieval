Transverse mass

The transverse mass is a useful quantity to define for use in particle physics as it is invariant under Lorentz boost along the z direction. In natural units it is:







where the z-direction is along the beam pipe and so
 


 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the momentum perpendicular to the beam pipe and
 


 
 
  is the (invariant) mass.
 

Hadron collider physicists use another definition of transverse mass, in the case of a decay into two particles. This is often used when one particle cannot be detected directly but is only indicated by missing transverse energy. In that case, the total energy is unknown and the above definition cannot be used.







where 
 
 
 
  is the transverse energy of each daughter, a positive quantity defined using its true invariant mass

 
  as:
 
 




So equivalently,








For massless daughters, where 
 
 
 
 , the transverse energy simplifies to 
 
 
 
 , and the transverse mass becomes







where 
 
 
 
  is the angle between the daughters in the transverse plane:
 

A distribution of 
 
 
 
 
  has an end-point at the true mother mass
 
 
 
 . This has been used to determine the 
 
 
 
  mass at the Tevatron.
