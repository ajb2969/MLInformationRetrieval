   Spatial Poisson process      Spatial Poisson process   In statistics and probability theory the spatial Poisson process (SPP) is a multidimensional generalization of the Poisson process , which can be described as a counting process where the number of points (events) in disjoint intervals are independent and have a Poisson distribution . Similarly, one can think of "points" being scattered over a   d   d   d   -dimensional space in some random manner and of the spatial Poisson process as counting the number of points in a given set. It is also common to speak of a Poisson point process instead of a SPP.  Definition  Usually, an SPP is considered on the Euclidean space    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   where    d  ≥  1      d  1    d\geq 1   . As with the one-dimensional Poisson process , a realization of an SPP on    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   is assumed to be a countable subset   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   of    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   . Thus,   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   can be seen as a countable set of points. The distribution of   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   through the number    |   Π  ∩  A   |        normal-Π  A     |\Pi\cap A|   of its points lying in a subset    A  ⊂   ℝ  d       A   superscript  ℝ  d     A\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}   is one way of characterizing an SPP. It is assumed, that there is a well defined notion of the "volume" of   A   A   A   . Specifically,    A  ∈   ℬ  d       A   superscript  ℬ  d     A\in\mathcal{B}^{d}   where    ℬ  d     superscript  ℬ  d    \mathcal{B}^{d}   is a Borel -   σ   σ   \sigma   algebra. Then    |  A  |      A    |A|   is the volume given by the Lebesgue measure of the Borel set   A   A   A   . 1 More generally it is possible to consider a state space    S  ⊄   ℝ  d      not-subset-of  S   superscript  ℝ  d     S\not\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}   in which the points of a Poisson process sit. Though, it is naturally assumed that   S   S   S   is a measurable space and that its measurable sets form a    σ   σ   \sigma   -field . It is also possible to define the SPP with a general measure    μ   μ   \mu   instead of using the Lebesgue measure. In that case    |   Π  ∩  A   |        normal-Π  A     |\Pi\cap A|   is replaced by    μ   (   Π  ∩  A   )       μ    normal-Π  A     \mu(\Pi\cap A)   . 2  SPPs are typically categorized as either homogeneous or inhomogeneous. When the intensity of the process   λ   λ   \lambda   is constant over   A   A   A   , the process is homogeneous, while if the intensity varies, the process is inhomogeneous.  Homogeneous spatial Poisson process  The random countable subset   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   of    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   is called a homogeneous spatial Poisson process with (constant) intensity   λ   λ   \lambda   if, for all    A  ∈   ℬ  d       A   superscript  ℬ  d     A\in\mathcal{B}^{d}   , the random variables     N   (  A  )    :=   |   Π  ∩  A   |      assign    N  A       normal-Π  A      N(A):=|\Pi\cap A|   satisfy: 3       N   (  A  )       N  A    N(A)   has the Poisson distribution with parameter    λ   |  A  |       λ    A     \lambda|A|   , and  if     A  1   ,   A  2   ,  …  ,   A  n       subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-…   subscript  A  n     A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{n}   are disjoint sets in    ℬ  d     superscript  ℬ  d    \mathcal{B}^{d}   , then     N   (   A  1   )    ,   N   (   A  2   )    ,  …  ,   N   (   A  n   )         N   subscript  A  1      N   subscript  A  2    normal-…    N   subscript  A  n      N(A_{1}),N(A_{2}),\ldots,N(A_{n})   are independent random variables.   The counting process   N   N   N   is commonly referred to be itself a Poisson process if it satisfies 1. and 2. above. The special case when    λ  >  0      λ  0    \lambda>0   and     |  A  |   =  ∞        A      |A|=\infty   , the situation is interpreted as    ℙ   (  |  Π  ∩  A  |  =  ∞  )   =  1     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|  Π   A  normal-|    normal-)    1    \mathbb{P}(|\Pi\cap A|=\infty)=1   .  Inhomogeneous spatial Poisson process  Roughly speaking, the inhomogeneous case differs from the homogeneous case by the intensity   λ   λ   \lambda   , which is not constant anymore. As indicated above, it is useful to have a definition of a Poisson process with other measures than Lebesgue measure. In order to get another measure    Λ   (  A  )       normal-Λ  A    \Lambda(A)   than    |  A  |      A    |A|   the Euclidean element    λ  d  𝐱      λ  d  x    \lambda d\textbf{x}   is replaced by the element    λ   (  𝐱  )   d  𝐱      λ  x  d  x    \lambda(\textbf{x})d\textbf{x}   . As a consequence the definition follows       Λ   (  A  )    :=    ∫  A    λ   (  𝐱  )   d  𝐱     ,   A  ∈   ℬ  d     .     formulae-sequence   assign    normal-Λ  A     subscript   A     λ  x  d  x       A   superscript  ℬ  d      \Lambda(A):=\int_{A}\lambda(\textbf{x})\,d\textbf{x},\quad A\in\mathcal{B}^{d}.     That leads to the following  Definition 4 Let    λ  :    ℝ  d   →  ℝ      normal-:  λ   normal-→   superscript  ℝ  d   ℝ     \lambda:\mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}   be a non-negative measurable function such that     Λ   (  A  )    <  ∞        normal-Λ  A      \Lambda(A)<\infty   for all bounded   A   A   A   . The random countable subset    Π  ⊂   ℝ  d       normal-Π   superscript  ℝ  d     \Pi\subset\mathbb{R}^{d}   is called inhomogeneous spatial Poisson process with intensity function   λ   λ   \lambda   if, for all    ℬ  d     superscript  ℬ  d    \mathcal{B}^{d}   , the random variables     N   (  A  )    =   |   Π  ∩  A   |         N  A       normal-Π  A      N(A)=|\Pi\cap A|   satisfy:       N   (  A  )       N  A    N(A)   has the Poisson distribution with parameter    Λ   (  A  )       normal-Λ  A    \Lambda(A)   , and  if     A  1   ,   A  2   ,  …  ,   A  n       subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-…   subscript  A  n     A_{1},A_{2},\ldots,A_{n}   are disjoint sets in    ℬ  d     superscript  ℬ  d    \mathcal{B}^{d}   , then     N   (   A  1   )    ,   N   (   A  2   )    ,  …  ,   N   (   A  n   )         N   subscript  A  1      N   subscript  A  2    normal-…    N   subscript  A  n      N(A_{1}),N(A_{2}),\ldots,N(A_{n})   are independent random variables.   The function      Λ   (  A  )    ,  A   ∈   ℬ  d          normal-Λ  A   A    superscript  ℬ  d     \Lambda(A),A\in\mathcal{B}^{d}   is often called the mean measure of the process   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   .  Examples  Besides the application of the Poisson process in one dimension, there are many examples in two and higher dimensions. Modeling with a spatial Poisson process can be done in the following situations: 5 6   The distribution of stars in a galaxy or of galaxies in the universe,  Positions of animals in their habitat,  The locations of active sites in a chemical reaction or of the weeds in your lawn,  Defects on a surface or in a volume in reliability engineering.  Positionally resolved photo-electron events on a photo-cathode focal plane array.   Even when a Poisson process is not a perfect description of such a system, it can provide a relatively simple yardstick against which to measure the improvements which may be offered by more sophisticated but often less tractable models.  Mathematical properties  Many properties known from the Poisson Process hold also true in the multidimensional process. The Poisson point process is also characterized by the single parameter   λ   λ   \lambda   . It is a simple, stationary point process with mean measure   λ   λ   \lambda   . 7  Equivalent formulation  It can be shown, that because of the two essential conditions the distribution of the spatial Poisson process is given by 8      ℙ   (  N   (   A  i   )   =   k  i   ,  1  ≤  i  ≤  n  )   =     (   λ   A  1    )    k  1      k  1   !    ⋅   e   -   λ   |   A  1   |      ⋯     (   λ   A  n    )    k  n      k  n   !    ⋅   e   -   λ   |   A  n   |      ,     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  N   fragments  normal-(   subscript  A  i   normal-)     subscript  k  i   normal-,  1   i   n  normal-)       superscript    λ   subscript  A  1     subscript  k  1       subscript  k  1     normal-⋅   superscript  e      λ     subscript  A  1       normal-⋯     superscript    λ   subscript  A  n     subscript  k  n       subscript  k  n     normal-⋅   superscript  e      λ     subscript  A  n       normal-,    \mathbb{P}(N(A_{i})=k_{i},1\leq i\leq n)=\dfrac{(\lambda A_{1})^{k_{1}}}{k_{1}%

 ^{-\lambda|A_{n}|},     for any disjoint bounded subsets     A  1   ,  …  ,   A  n       subscript  A  1   normal-…   subscript  A  n     A_{1},...,A_{n}   and non-negative integers     k  1   ,  …  ,   k  n       subscript  k  1   normal-…   subscript  k  n     k_{1},\ldots,k_{n}   .  Derivation from physically postulates  Using the law of rare events the Poisson process can be concluded by certain physically plausible postulates. 9 Let    N   (  A  )       N  A    N(A)   be a random point process fulfilling these postulates, then    N   (  A  )       N  A    N(A)   is a homogeneous Poisson Point Process with intensity   λ   λ   \lambda   derived from the postulates and the distribution is given as above in the Equivalent Formulation . Namely the four postulates are:   The possible values for    N   (  A  )       N  A    N(A)   are the nonnegative integers    {  0  ,  1  ,  2  ,  …  }     0  1  2  normal-…    \{0,1,2,\ldots\}   and    0  <  ℙ   (  N   (  A  )   =  0  )   <  1     fragments  0   P   fragments  normal-(  N   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)    0  normal-)    1    0<\mathbb{P}(N(A)=0)<1   if    0  <   |  A  |   <  ∞        0    A            0<|A|<\infty   .  The probability distribution of    N   (  A  )       N  A    N(A)   depends on the set   A   A   A   only through its size (length, area, or volume)    |  A  |      A    |A|   , with the further property that    0  <  ℙ   (  N   (  A  )   ≥  1  )   =  λ  |  A  |  +  o   (  |  A  |  )      fragments  0   P   fragments  normal-(  N   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)    1  normal-)    λ  normal-|  A  normal-|   o   fragments  normal-(  normal-|  A  normal-|  normal-)     0<\mathbb{P}(N(A)\geq 1)=\lambda|A|+o(|A|)   as     |  A  |   ↓  0.     normal-↓    A   0.    |A|\downarrow 0.     For     m  ≥  2   ,      m  2    m\geq 2,   if     A  1   ,  …  ,   A  m       subscript  A  1   normal-…   subscript  A  m     A_{1},\ldots,A_{m}   are disjoint regions, then     N   (   A  1   )    ,   N   (   A  2   )    ,  …  ,   N   (   A  m   )         N   subscript  A  1      N   subscript  A  2    normal-…    N   subscript  A  m      N(A_{1}),N(A_{2}),\ldots,N(A_{m})   are independent random variables and      N   (    A  1   ∪   A  2   ∪  ⋯  ∪   A  m    )    =    N   (   A  1   )    +   N   (   A  2   )    +  ⋯  +   N   (   A  m   )      .        N     subscript  A  1    subscript  A  2   normal-⋯   subscript  A  m         N   subscript  A  1      N   subscript  A  2    normal-⋯    N   subscript  A  m       N(A_{1}\cup A_{2}\cup\cdots\cup A_{m})=N(A_{1})+N(A_{2})+\cdots+N(A_{m}).           lim    |  A  |   →  0       ℙ   (  N   (  A  )   ≥  1  )     ℙ   (  N   (  A  )   =  1  )       =  1.        subscript    normal-→    A   0       fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  N   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)    1  normal-)     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  N   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)    1  normal-)      1.    \lim\limits_{|A|\to 0}\dfrac{\mathbb{P}(N(A)\geq 1)}{\mathbb{P}(N(A)=1)}=1.      While postulate 1 excludes extreme or trivial cases, the second one asserts that the probability distribution of    N   (  A  )       N  A    N(A)   does depend only on the size of   A   A   A   , not on the shape or location. Thirdly it is postulated, that disjoint regions are independent regarding the outcome of the process. Finally, postulate 4 requires that there cannot be tow points occupying the same location.  Distribution of n points in a given set  We are interested in the distribution of a point from which is supposed to be contained in a region   A   A   A   with positive size     |  A  |   >  0        A   0    |A|>0   . In other words     N   (  A  )    =  1        N  A   1    N(A)=1   . The question where the point can be found in   A   A   A   is answered by a uniform distribution : 10      ℙ   (  N   (  B  )   =  1  ∣  N   (  A  )   =  1  )   =    |  B  |    |  A  |       fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  N   fragments  normal-(  B  normal-)    1  normal-∣  N   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)    1  normal-)        B     A      \mathbb{P}(N(B)=1\mid N(A)=1)=\dfrac{|B|}{|A|}   for any set    B  ⊂  A      B  A    B\subset A     Consider again a region with positive size     |  A  |   >  0        A   0    |A|>0   , and suppose now it is known that   A   A   A   contains exactly   n   n   n   points. Then, these points are independent and uniformly distributed in   A   A   A   in the sense that for any disjoint partition     A  1   ,  …  ,   A  m       subscript  A  1   normal-…   subscript  A  m     A_{1},\ldots,A_{m}   of   A   A   A   , and any positive integers    k  i     subscript  k  i    k_{i}   , where      k  1   +  ⋯  +   k  m    =  n         subscript  k  1   normal-⋯   subscript  k  m    n    k_{1}+\cdots+k_{m}=n   , we have      ℙ   (  N   (   A  1   )   =   k  1   ,  …  ,  N   (   A  m   )   =   k  m   ∣  N   (  A  )   =  n  )   =    n  !      k  1   !   ⋯    k  m   !       (    |   A  1   |    |  A  |    )    k  1    ⋯    (    |   A  m   |    |  A  |    )    k  m    .     fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  N   fragments  normal-(   subscript  A  1   normal-)     subscript  k  1   normal-,  normal-…  normal-,  N   fragments  normal-(   subscript  A  m   normal-)     subscript  k  m   normal-∣  N   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)    n  normal-)        n        subscript  k  1    normal-⋯     subscript  k  m       superscript   fragments  normal-(       subscript  A  1      A    normal-)    subscript  k  1    normal-⋯   superscript   fragments  normal-(       subscript  A  m      A    normal-)    subscript  k  m    normal-.    \mathbb{P}(N(A_{1})=k_{1},\ldots,N(A_{m})=k_{m}\mid N(A)=n)=\dfrac{n!}{k_{1}!%
 \cdots k_{m}!}\left(\dfrac{|A_{1}|}{|A|}\right)^{k_{1}}\cdots\left(\dfrac{|A_{%
 m}|}{|A|}\right)^{k_{m}}.   Thus, the conditional distribution follows a multinomial distribution . 11  Other properties  The union of two independent SPP is again a spatial Poisson process:  Superposition Theorem 12 Let    Π  ′     superscript  normal-Π  normal-′    \Pi^{\prime}   and    Π  ′′     superscript  normal-Π  ′′    \Pi^{\prime\prime}   be independent Poisson processes on    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   with respective intensity functions    λ  ′     superscript  λ  normal-′    \lambda^{\prime}   and    λ  ′′     superscript  λ  ′′    \lambda^{\prime\prime}   . The set    Π  =    Π  ′   ∪   Π  ′′        normal-Π     superscript  normal-Π  normal-′    superscript  normal-Π  ′′      \Pi=\Pi^{\prime}\cup\Pi^{\prime\prime}   is a Poisson process with intensity function    λ  =    λ  ′   +   λ  ′′        λ     superscript  λ  normal-′    superscript  λ  ′′      \lambda=\lambda^{\prime}+\lambda^{\prime\prime}   . The theorem can be generalized to the union of more than two processes.  There exist a complementary version to the superposition theorem:  Colouring theorem 13 Let   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   be a non-homogeneous Poisson process on    ℝ  d     superscript  ℝ  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   with intensity function    λ   (  𝐱  )       λ  x    \lambda(\textbf{x})   . We colour the points of   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   in the following way. A point of   Π   normal-Π   \Pi   at position x is coloured green with probability    γ   (  𝐱  )       γ  x    \gamma(\textbf{x})   ; otherwise it is coloured scarlet (with probability     σ   (  𝐱  )    =   1  -   γ   (  𝐱  )           σ  x     1    γ  x      \sigma(\textbf{x})=1-\gamma(\textbf{x})   ). Points are coloured independently of one another. Let   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   and   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   be the sets of points coloured green and scarlet, respectively. Then   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   and   Σ   normal-Σ   \Sigma   are independent Poisson processes with respective intensity functions    γ   (  𝐱  )   λ   (  𝐱  )       γ  x  λ  x    \gamma(\textbf{x})\lambda(\textbf{x})   and    σ   (  𝐱  )   λ   (  𝐱  )       σ  x  λ  x    \sigma(\textbf{x})\lambda(\textbf{x})   .
