   Thomas Muir (mathematician)      Thomas Muir (mathematician)   Sir Thomas Muir  FRS 1 (25 August 1844 ‚Äì 21 March 1934) was a Scottish  mathematician , remembered as an authority on determinants . 2 3 4 He was born in Stonebyres in South Lanarkshire , and brought up in the small town of Biggar . At the University of Glasgow he changed his studies from classics to mathematics after advice from the future Lord Kelvin . After graduating he held positions at the University of St Andrews and the University of Glasgow . From 1874 to 1892 he taught at Glasgow High School . In 1882 he published Treatise on the theory of determinants ; then in 1890 he published a History of determinants . In his 1882 work, Muir rediscovered an important lemma that was first proved by Cayley 35 years earlier: 5  If B is a skew symmetric matrix , then its determinant is equal to the square of its Pfaffian :       det   (  ùêÅ  )    =    pf  2    (  ùêÅ  )          ùêÅ     superscript  pf  2   ùêÅ     \det(\mathbf{B})=\operatorname{pf}^{2}(\mathbf{B})\,     From 1892 he was in South Africa working in education, and then in administration at the University of the Cape . He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and in 1900 a Fellow of the Royal Society . 6 He was installed Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George (CMG) in 1901 and knighted in 1915.  From 1906 onwards he published a five-volume expansion of his history of determinants, the final part (1929) taking the theory to 1920. A further book followed in 1930.  His name now attaches to a duality theorem on relations between minors . In more abstract language, it is a general result on the equations defining Grassmannians as algebraic varieties .
