   McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions      McCullagh's parametrization of the Cauchy distributions   In probability theory , the "standard" Cauchy distribution is the probability distribution whose probability density function (pdf) is       f   (  x  )    =   1   π   (   1  +   x  2    )           f  x     1    π    1   superscript  x  2        f(x)={1\over\pi(1+x^{2})}     for x  real . This has median 0, and first and third quartiles respectively −1 and +1. Generally, a Cauchy distribution is any probability distribution belonging to the same location-scale family as this one. Thus, if X has a standard Cauchy distribution and μ is any real number and σ > 0, then Y = μ + σ X has a Cauchy distribution whose median is μ and whose first and third quartiles are respectively μ − σ and μ + σ.  McCullagh's parametrization , introduced by Peter McCullagh , professor of statistics at the University of Chicago uses the two parameters of the non-standardised distribution to form a single complex-valued parameter, specifically, the complex number θ = μ + i σ, where i is the imaginary unit . It also extends the usual range of scale parameter to include σ f(x) = {1 \over \pi \left \vert \sigma \right \vert (1 + \frac{(x-\mu)^2}{\sigma^2} ) }\,, where the distribution is regarded as degenerate if σ = 0. An alternative form for the density can be written using the complex parameter θ = μ + i σ as        f   (  x  )    =     |   ℑ  θ   |    π    |   x  -  θ   |   2       ,        f  x         θ      π   superscript      x  θ    2       f(x)={\left|\Im{\theta}\right|\over\pi\left|x-\theta\right|^{2}}\,,   where     ℑ  θ   =  σ        θ   σ    \Im{\theta}=\sigma   .  To the question "Why introduce complex numbers when only real-valued random variables are involved?", McCullagh wrote:  In other words, if the random variable Y has a Cauchy distribution with complex parameter θ , then the random variable Y * defined above has a Cauchy distribution with parameter ( aθ + b )/( cθ + d ).  McCullagh also wrote, "The distribution of the first exit point from the upper half-plane of a Brownian particle starting at θ is the Cauchy density on the real line with parameter θ ." In addition, McCullagh shows that the complex-valued parameterisation allows a simple relationship to be made between the Cauchy and the "circular Cauchy distribution".  Differential equation  McCullagh's parametrization of the pdf of the Cauchy distribution is a solution to the following differential equation :      {          f  ′    (  x  )    (     μ  2   +   σ  2   +   x  2    -   2  μ  x    )    +   f   (  x  )    (    2  x   -   2  μ    )     =  0   ,         f   (  0  )    =   1   π   |  σ  |    (     μ  2    σ  2    +  1   )         }              superscript  f  normal-′   x       superscript  μ  2    superscript  σ  2    superscript  x  2      2  μ  x       f  x      2  x     2  μ      0         f  0     1    π    σ        superscript  μ  2    superscript  σ  2    1          \left\{\begin{array}[]{l}f^{\prime}(x)\left(\mu^{2}+\sigma^{2}+x^{2}-2\mu x%
 \right)+f(x)(2x-2\mu)=0,\\
 f(0)=\frac{1}{\pi\left|\sigma\right|\left(\frac{\mu^{2}}{\sigma^{2}}+1\right)}%
