   Comparison of topologies      Comparison of topologies   In topology and related areas of mathematics , the set of all possible topologies on a given set forms a partially ordered set . This order relation can be used for comparison of the topologies .  Definition  Let τ 1 and τ 2 be two topologies on a set X such that τ 1 is contained in τ 2 :       τ  1   ⊆   τ  2        subscript  τ  1    subscript  τ  2     \tau_{1}\subseteq\tau_{2}   . That is, every element of τ 1 is also an element of τ 2 . Then the topology τ 1 is said to be a coarser ( weaker or smaller ) topology than τ 2 , and τ 2 is said to be a finer ( stronger or larger ) topology than τ 1 . 1 If additionally       τ  1   ≠   τ  2        subscript  τ  1    subscript  τ  2     \tau_{1}\neq\tau_{2}   we say τ 1 is strictly coarser than τ 2 and τ 2 is strictly finer than τ 1 . 2  The binary relation ⊆ defines a partial ordering relation on the set of all possible topologies on X .  Examples  The finest topology on X is the discrete topology ; this topology makes all subsets open. The coarsest topology on X is the trivial topology ; this topology only admits the null set and the whole space as open sets.  In function spaces and spaces of measures there are often a number of possible topologies. See topologies on the set of operators on a Hilbert space for some intricate relationships.  All possible polar topologies on a dual pair are finer than the weak topology and coarser than the strong topology .  Properties  Let τ 1 and τ 2 be two topologies on a set X . Then the following statements are equivalent:   τ 1 ⊆ τ 2  the identity map id X : ( X , τ 2 ) → ( X , τ 1 ) is a continuous map .  the identity map id X : ( X , τ 1 ) → ( X , τ 2 ) is an open map (or, equivalently, a closed map )   Two immediate corollaries of this statement are   A continuous map f : X → Y remains continuous if the topology on Y becomes coarser or the topology on X  finer .  An open (resp. closed) map f : X → Y remains open (resp. closed) if the topology on Y becomes finer or the topology on X  coarser .   One can also compare topologies using neighborhood bases . Let τ 1 and τ 2 be two topologies on a set X and let B i ( x ) be a local base for the topology τ i at x ∈ X for i = 1,2. Then τ 1 ⊆ τ 2 if and only if for all x ∈ X , each open set U 1 in B 1 ( x ) contains some open set U 2 in B 2 ( x ). Intuitively, this makes sense: a finer topology should have smaller neighborhoods.  Lattice of topologies  The set of all topologies on a set X together with the partial ordering relation ⊆ forms a complete lattice that is also closed under arbitrary intersections. That is, any collection of topologies on X have a meet (or infimum ) and a join (or supremum ). The meet of a collection of topologies is the intersection of those topologies. The join, however, is not generally the union of those topologies (the union of two topologies need not be a topology) but rather the topology generated by the union.  Every complete lattice is also a bounded lattice , which is to say that it has a greatest and least element . In the case of topologies, the greatest element is the discrete topology and the least element is the trivial topology .
