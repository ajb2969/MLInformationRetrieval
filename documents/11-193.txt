D-glutamate cyclase

In enzymology, a D-glutamate cyclase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-glutamate 
 
 
 
  5-oxo-D-proline + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-glutamate, and two products, 5-oxo-D-proline and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glutamate hydro-lyase (cyclizing; 5-oxo-D-proline-forming). This enzyme is also called D-glutamate hydro-lyase (cyclizing). This enzyme participates in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism.
