   D-glutamate cyclase      D-glutamate cyclase   In enzymology , a D-glutamate cyclase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-glutamate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   5-oxo-D-proline + H 2 O   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , D-glutamate , and two products , 5-oxo-D-proline and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-glutamate hydro-lyase (cyclizing; 5-oxo-D-proline-forming) . This enzyme is also called D-glutamate hydro-lyase (cyclizing) . This enzyme participates in d-glutamine and d-glutamate metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 4.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
