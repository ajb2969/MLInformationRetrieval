   Lazarus Fuchs      Lazarus Fuchs   Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs (5 May 1833 – 26 April 1902) was a German  mathematician who contributed important research in the field of linear differential equations . 1 He was born in Moschin (Mosina) (located in Grand Duchy of Posen ) and died in Berlin , Germany . He was buried in Schöneberg in the St. Matthew's Cemetery . His grave in section H is preserved and listed as a grave of honour of the State of Berlin.  He is the eponym of Fuchsian groups and functions, and the Picard–Fuchs equation ; Fuchsian  differential equations are those with regular singularities . Fuchs is also known for Fuchs's theorem which states that if x 0 is a regular singular point then the differential equation        p   (  x  )    y  ′′    +   q   (  x  )    y  ′    +   r   (  x  )   y    =   0           p  x   superscript  y  ′′      q  x   superscript  y  normal-′      r  x  y    0    p(x)y^{\prime\prime}+q(x)y^{\prime}+r(x)y=0\,     has at least one solution of the form       y  =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n     (   x  -   x  0    )    n  +  σ       ,    a  0   ≠   0       formulae-sequence    y    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript    x   subscript  x  0      n  σ          subscript  a  0   0     y=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}(x-x_{0})^{n+\sigma},\quad a_{0}\neq 0\,     for some σ to be determined. In some cases, there will be two linearly independent solutions of that form.
