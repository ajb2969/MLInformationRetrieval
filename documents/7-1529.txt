   Sylvester's sequence      Sylvester's sequence   In number theory , Sylvester's sequence is an integer sequence in which each member of the sequence is the product of the previous members, plus one. The first few terms of the sequence are:   2, 3, 7, 43, 1807, 3263443, 10650056950807, 113423713055421844361000443 .   Sylvester's sequence is named after James Joseph Sylvester , who first investigated it in 1880. Its values grow doubly exponentially , and the sum of its reciprocals forms a series of unit fractions that converges to 1 more rapidly than any other series of unit fractions with the same number of terms. The recurrence by which it is defined allows the numbers in the sequence to be factored more easily than other numbers of the same magnitude, but, due to the rapid growth of the sequence, complete prime factorizations are known only for a few of its members. Values derived from this sequence have also been used to construct finite Egyptian fraction representations of 1, Sasakian  Einstein manifolds , and hard instances for online algorithms .  Formal definitions  Formally, Sylvester's sequence can be defined by the formula        s  n   =   1  +    ∏   i  =  0    n  -  1     s  i      .       subscript  s  n     1    superscript   subscript  product    i  0      n  1     subscript  s  i       s_{n}=1+\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}s_{i}.   The product of an empty set is 1, so s 0 = 2.  Alternatively, one may define the sequence by the recurrence        s  i   =     s   i  -  1     (    s   i  -  1    -  1   )    +  1    ,       subscript  s  i        subscript  s    i  1       subscript  s    i  1    1    1     \displaystyle s_{i}=s_{i-1}(s_{i-1}-1)+1,   with s 0 = 2. It is straightforward to show by induction that this is equivalent to the other definition.  Closed form formula and asymptotics  The Sylvester numbers grow doubly exponentially as a function of n . Specifically, it can be shown that        s  n   =   ⌊    E   2   n  +  1     +   1  2    ⌋    ,       subscript  s  n        superscript  E   superscript  2    n  1       1  2       s_{n}=\left\lfloor E^{2^{n+1}}+\frac{1}{2}\right\rfloor,     for a number E that is approximately 1.264084735305302. 1 This formula has the effect of the following algorithm :   s 0 is the nearest integer to E 2 ; s 1 is the nearest integer to E 4 ; s 2 is the nearest integer to E 8 ; for s n , take E 2 , square it n more times, and take the nearest integer.   This would only be a practical algorithm if we had a better way of calculating E to the requisite number of places than calculating s n and taking its repeated square root.  The double-exponential growth of the Sylvester sequence is unsurprising if one compares it to the sequence of Fermat numbers  F n ; the Fermat numbers are usually defined by a doubly exponential formula,     2   2  n    +  1       superscript  2   superscript  2  n    1    2^{2^{n}}+1   , but they can also be defined by a product formula very similar to that defining Sylvester's sequence:        F  n   =   2  +    ∏   i  =  0    n  -  1     F  i      .       subscript  F  n     2    superscript   subscript  product    i  0      n  1     subscript  F  i       F_{n}=2+\prod_{i=0}^{n-1}F_{i}.     Connection with Egyptian fractions  The unit fractions formed by the reciprocals of the values in Sylvester's sequence generate an infinite series :         ∑   i  =  0   ∞    1   s  i     =    1  2   +   1  3   +   1  7   +   1  43   +   1  1807   +  ⋯    .        superscript   subscript     i  0        1   subscript  s  i         1  2     1  3     1  7     1  43     1  1807   normal-⋯     \sum_{i=0}^{\infty}\frac{1}{s_{i}}=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1%
 }{43}+\frac{1}{1807}+\cdots.   The partial sums of this series have a simple form,         ∑   i  =  0    j  -  1     1   s  i     =   1  -   1    s  j   -  1     =     s  j   -  2     s  j   -  1     .          superscript   subscript     i  0      j  1      1   subscript  s  i       1    1     subscript  s  j   1               subscript  s  j   2      subscript  s  j   1       \sum_{i=0}^{j-1}\frac{1}{s_{i}}=1-\frac{1}{s_{j}-1}=\frac{s_{j}-2}{s_{j}-1}.   This may be proved by induction, or more directly by noting that the recursion implies that         1    s  i   -  1    -   1    s   i  +  1    -  1     =   1   s  i     ,          1     subscript  s  i   1      1     subscript  s    i  1    1       1   subscript  s  i      \frac{1}{s_{i}-1}-\frac{1}{s_{i+1}-1}=\frac{1}{s_{i}},   so the sum telescopes         ∑   i  =  0    j  -  1     1   s  i     =    ∑   i  =  0    j  -  1     (    1    s  i   -  1    -   1    s   i  +  1    -  1     )    =    1    s  0   -  1    -   1    s  j   -  1     =   1  -   1    s  j   -  1      .          superscript   subscript     i  0      j  1      1   subscript  s  i       superscript   subscript     i  0      j  1        1     subscript  s  i   1      1     subscript  s    i  1    1               1     subscript  s  0   1      1     subscript  s  j   1            1    1     subscript  s  j   1        \sum_{i=0}^{j-1}\frac{1}{s_{i}}=\sum_{i=0}^{j-1}\left(\frac{1}{s_{i}-1}-\frac{%
 1}{s_{i+1}-1}\right)=\frac{1}{s_{0}-1}-\frac{1}{s_{j}-1}=1-\frac{1}{s_{j}-1}.   Since this sequence of partial sums ( s j -2)/( s j -1) converges to one, the overall series forms an infinite Egyptian fraction representation of the number one:       1  =    1  2   +   1  3   +   1  7   +   1  43   +   1  1807   +  ⋯    .      1      1  2     1  3     1  7     1  43     1  1807   normal-⋯     1=\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{43}+\frac{1}{1807}+\cdots.   One can find finite Egyptian fraction representations of one, of any length, by truncating this series and subtracting one from the last denominator:        1  =     1  2    +    1  3    +    1  6      ,    1  =     1  2    +    1  3    +    1  7    +    1  42      ,   1  =      1  2    +    1  3    +    1  7    +    1  43    +    1  1806     ,  …      .     formulae-sequence    1      1  2     1  3     1  6      formulae-sequence    1      1  2     1  3     1  7     1  42       1       1  2     1  3     1  7     1  43     1  1806    normal-…       1=\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{3}+\tfrac{1}{6},\quad 1=\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{3}+%
 \tfrac{1}{7}+\tfrac{1}{42},\quad 1=\tfrac{1}{2}+\tfrac{1}{3}+\tfrac{1}{7}+%
 \tfrac{1}{43}+\tfrac{1}{1806},\quad\dots.   The sum of the first k terms of the infinite series provides the closest possible underestimate of 1 by any k -term Egyptian fraction. 2 For example, the first four terms add to 1805/1806, and therefore any Egyptian fraction for a number in the open interval (1805/1806,1) requires at least five terms.  It is possible to interpret the Sylvester sequence as the result of a greedy algorithm for Egyptian fractions , that at each step chooses the smallest possible denominator that makes the partial sum of the series be less than one. Alternatively, the terms of the sequence after the first can be viewed as the denominators of the odd greedy expansion of 1/2.  Uniqueness of quickly growing series with rational sums  As Sylvester himself observed, Sylvester's sequence seems to be unique in having such quickly growing values, while simultaneously having a series of reciprocals that converges to a rational number. This sequence provides an example showing that double-exponential growth is not enough to cause an integer sequence to be an irrationality sequence .  To make this more precise, it follows from results of  that, if a sequence of integers    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   grows quickly enough that        a  n   ≥     a   n  -  1   2   -   a   n  -  1     +  1    ,       subscript  a  n        superscript   subscript  a    n  1    2    subscript  a    n  1     1     a_{n}\geq a_{n-1}^{2}-a_{n-1}+1,   and if the series      A  =   ∑   1   a  i         A      1   subscript  a  i       A=\sum\frac{1}{a_{i}}   converges to a rational number A , then, for all n after some point, this sequence must be defined by the same recurrence       a  n   =     a   n  -  1   2   -   a   n  -  1     +  1        subscript  a  n        superscript   subscript  a    n  1    2    subscript  a    n  1     1     a_{n}=a_{n-1}^{2}-a_{n-1}+1   that can be used to define Sylvester's sequence.  conjectured that, in results of this type, the inequality bounding the growth of the sequence could be replaced by a weaker condition,        lim   n  →  ∞      a  n    a   n  -  1   2     =  1.        subscript    normal-→  n        subscript  a  n    superscript   subscript  a    n  1    2     1.    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{a_{n}}{a_{n-1}^{2}}=1.   surveys progress related to this conjecture; see also .  Divisibility and factorizations  If i  j ≡ 1 (mod s i ). Therefore, every two numbers in Sylvester's sequence are relatively prime . The sequence can be used to prove that there are infinitely many prime numbers , as any prime can divide at most one number in the sequence. More strongly, no prime factor of a number in the sequence can be congruent to 5 (mod 6), and the sequence can be used to prove that there are infinitely many primes congruent to 7 (mod 12).  Much remains unknown about the factorization of the numbers in the Sylvester's sequence. For instance, it is not known if all numbers in the sequence are squarefree , although all the known terms are.  As  describes, it is easy to determine which Sylvester number (if any) a given prime p divides: simply compute the recurrence defining the numbers modulo p until finding either a number that is congruent to zero (mod p ) or finding a repeated modulus. Via this technique he found that 1166 out of the first three million primes are divisors of Sylvester numbers, 3 and that none of these primes has a square that divides a Sylvester number. The set of primes which can occur as factors of Sylvester numbers is of density zero in the set of all primes: indeed, the number of such primes less than x is    O   (    π   (  x  )    /   log   log   log  x      )       O      π  x         x        O(\pi(x)/\log\log\log x)   .  The following table shows known factorizations of these numbers, (except the first four, which are all prime): 4      n   Factors of s n       4   13 × 139     5   3263443, which is prime     6   547 × 607 × 1033 × 31051     7   29881 × 67003 × 9119521 × 6212157481     8   5295435634831 × 31401519357481261 × 77366930214021991992277     9   181 × 1987 × 112374829138729 × 114152531605972711 × 35874380272246624152764569191134894955972560447869169859142453622851     10   2287 × 2271427 × 21430986826194127130578627950810640891005487 × P156     11   73 × C416     12   2589377038614498251653 × 2872413602289671035947763837 × C785     13   52387 × 5020387 × 5783021473 × 401472621488821859737 × 287001545675964617409598279 × C1600     14   13999 × 74203 × 9638659 × 57218683 × 10861631274478494529 × C3293     15   17881 × 97822786011310111 × 54062008753544850522999875710411 × C6618     16   128551 × C13335     17   635263 × 1286773 × 21269959 × C26661     18   50201023123 × 139263586549 × 60466397701555612333765567 × C53313     19   775608719589345260583891023073879169 × C106685     20   352867 × 6210298470888313 × C213419     21   387347773 × 1620516511 × C426863     22   91798039513 × C853750     As is customary, P n and C n denote prime and composite numbers  n digits long.  Applications  use the properties of Sylvester's sequence to define large numbers of Sasakian  Einstein manifolds having the differential topology of odd-dimensional spheres or exotic spheres . They show that the number of distinct Sasakian Einstein metrics on a topological sphere of dimension 2 n − 1 is at least proportional to s n and hence has double exponential growth with n .  As  describe,  and  used values derived from Sylvester's sequence to construct lower bound examples for online  bin packing  algorithms .  similarly use the sequence to lower bound the performance of a two-dimensional cutting stock algorithm. 5  Znám's problem concerns sets of numbers such that each number in the set divides but is not equal to the product of all the other numbers, plus one. Without the inequality requirement, the values in Sylvester's sequence would solve the problem; with that requirement, it has other solutions derived from recurrences similar to the one defining Sylvester's sequence. Solutions to Znám's problem have applications to the classification of surface singularities (Brenton and Hill 1988) and to the theory of nondeterministic finite automata .  describes an application of the closest approximations to one by k -term sums of unit fractions, in lower-bounding the number of divisors of any perfect number , and  uses the same property to lower bound the size of certain groups .
