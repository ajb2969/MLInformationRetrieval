Beta-pyrazolylalanine synthase




Beta-pyrazolylalanine synthase

In enzymology, a beta-pyrazolylalanine synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

O3-acetyl-L-serine + pyrazole 
 
 
 
  3-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are O3-acetyl-L-serine and pyrazole, whereas its two products are 3-(pyrazol-1-yl)-L-alanine and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring aryl or alkyl groups other than methyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is O3-acetyl-L-serine:pyrazole 1-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)transferase. Other names in common use include beta-(1-pyrazolyl)alanine synthase, beta-pyrazolealanine synthase, beta-pyrazolylalanine synthase (acetylserine), O3-acetyl-L-serine acetate-lyase (adding pyrazole), BPA-synthase, pyrazolealanine synthase, pyrazolylalaninase, and 3-O-acetyl-L-serine:pyrazole 1-(2-amino-2-carboxyethyl)transferase.
