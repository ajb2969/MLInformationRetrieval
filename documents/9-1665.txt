It is located relatively close to the Sun , at a distance of 16.1 light years . Gliese 832 has about half the mass and radius of the Sun.  In 2014, Gliese 832 was announced to be hosting the closest potentially habitable Earth-mass-range exoplanet to the Solar System.  Distance          Planetary system  Gliese 832 hosts two known planets.  Discovery of Jupiter mass planet  In September 2008, it was announced that a Jupiter -like planet, now designated as Gliese 832 b , had been detected in a long-period, near-circular orbit around this star (false alarm probability thus far: a negligible 0.05%). It would induce an astrometric perturbation on its star of at least 0.95 milliarcseconds and is thus a good candidate for being detected by astrometric observations. Despite its relatively large angular distance, direct imaging is problematic due to the star–planet contrast. 5  Discovery of Gliese 832 c (super-Earth mass planet) in habitable zone  In 2014, a second planet was discovered by astronomers at the University of New South Wales. This one is believed to be of super-Earth mass and has since been given the scientific name Gliese 832 c . It was announced to orbit in the optimistic habitable zone but outside the conservative habitable zone of its parent star. 6  The planet is believed to be in, or very close to, the right distance from its sun to allow liquid water to exist on its surface.  Search for cometary disc  If this system has a comet disc, it is undetectable "brighter than the fractional dust luminosity 10 −5 " of a recent Herschel study. 7   X-ray source  Gliese 832 emits X-rays. 8  See also   List of nearest stars  List of extrasolar planets   Notes  =10.19 and the absolute visual magnitude of the Sun     M   V  ⊙    =  4.83       subscript  M   subscript  V  direct-product    4.83    \scriptstyle M_{V_{\odot}}=4.83   , the visual luminosity can be calculated by       L   V  ∗     L   V  ⊙      =   10   0.4   (    M   V  ⊙    -   M   V  ∗     )            subscript  L   subscript  V  normal-∗     subscript  L   subscript  V  direct-product      superscript  10    0.4     subscript  M   subscript  V  direct-product     subscript  M   subscript  V  normal-∗         \scriptstyle\frac{L_{V_{\ast}}}{L_{V_{\odot}}}=10^{0.4\left(M_{V_{\odot}}-M_{V%
