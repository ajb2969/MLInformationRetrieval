   Indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase      Indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase   In enzymology , an indole-3-acetaldehyde oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde + H 2 O + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   (indol-3-yl)acetate + H 2 O 2    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde , H 2 O , and O 2 , whereas its two products are (indol-3-yl)acetate and H 2 O 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (indol-3-yl)acetaldehyde:oxygen oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include indoleacetaldehyde oxidase , IAAld oxidase , AO1 , and indole-3-acetaldehyde:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in tryptophan metabolism . It has 3 cofactors : FAD , Heme , and Molybdenum .
