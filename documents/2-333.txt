   Nilpotent group      Nilpotent group   In group theory , a nilpotent group is a group that is "almost abelian ". This idea is motivated by the fact that nilpotent groups are solvable , and for finite nilpotent groups, two elements having relatively prime orders must commute. It is also true that finite nilpotent groups are supersolvable .  Nilpotent groups arise in Galois theory , as well as in the classification of groups. They also appear prominently in the classification of Lie groups .  Analogous terms are used for Lie algebras (using the Lie bracket ) including nilpotent , lower central series , and upper central series .  Definition  The definition uses the idea, explained on its own page, of a central series for a group. The following are equivalent formulations:   A nilpotent group is one that has a central series of finite length.  A nilpotent group is one whose lower central series terminates in the trivial subgroup after finitely many steps.  A nilpotent group is one whose upper central series terminates in the whole group after finitely many steps.   For a nilpotent group, the smallest n such that G has a central series of length n is called the nilpotency class of G ; and G is said to be nilpotent of class n . (By definition, the length is n if there are n + 1 different subgroups in the series, including the trivial subgroup and the whole group.)  Equivalently, the nilpotency class of G equals the length of the lower central series or upper central series. If a group has nilpotency class at most m , then it is sometimes called a nil- m group .  It follows immediately from any of the above forms of the definition of nilpotency, that the trivial group is the unique group of nilpotency class 0, and groups of nilpotency class 1 are exactly the non-trivial abelian groups. 1 2  Examples  (Figure)  A portion of the Cayley graph of the discrete Heisenberg group , a well-known nilpotent group.    As noted above, every abelian group is nilpotent. 3 4  For a small non-abelian example, consider the quaternion group  Q 8 , which is a smallest non-abelian p -group. It has center {1, −1} of order 2, and its upper central series is {1}, {1, −1}, Q 8 ; so it is nilpotent of class 2.  All finite p -groups are in fact nilpotent ( proof ). The maximal class of a group of order p n is n - 1. The 2-groups of maximal class are the generalised quaternion groups , the dihedral groups , and the semidihedral groups .  The direct product of two nilpotent groups is nilpotent. 5  Conversely, every finite nilpotent group is the direct product of p -groups. 6  The Heisenberg group is an example of non-abelian, 7 infinite nilpotent group. 8  The multiplicative group of upper unitriangular  n x n matrices over any field F  is a nilpotent group of nilpotent length n - 1 .  The multiplicative group of invertible upper triangular  n x n matrices over a field F is not in general nilpotent, but is solvable .   Explanation of term  Nilpotent groups are so called because the "adjoint action" of any element is nilpotent , meaning that for a nilpotent group G of nilpotence degree n and an element g , the function     ad  g   :   G  →  G      normal-:   subscript  ad  g    normal-→  G  G     \operatorname{ad}_{g}\colon G\to G   defined by      ad  g    (  x  )    :=   [  g  ,  x  ]      assign    subscript  ad  g   x    g  x     \operatorname{ad}_{g}(x):=[g,x]   (where     [  g  ,  x  ]   =    g   -  1     x   -  1    g  x        g  x      superscript  g    1     superscript  x    1    g  x     [g,x]=g^{-1}x^{-1}gx   is the commutator of g and x ) is nilpotent in the sense that the n th iteration of the function is trivial       (   ad  g   )   n    (  x  )    =  e         superscript   subscript  ad  g   n   x   e    \left(\operatorname{ad}_{g}\right)^{n}(x)=e   for all   x   x   x   in   G   G   G   .  This is not a defining characteristic of nilpotent groups: groups for which    ad  g     subscript  ad  g    \operatorname{ad}_{g}   is nilpotent of degree n (in the sense above) are called n - Engel groups , 9 and need not be nilpotent in general. They are proven to be nilpotent if they have finite order , and are conjectured to be nilpotent as long as they are finitely generated .  An abelian group is precisely one for which the adjoint action is not just nilpotent but trivial (a 1-Engel group).  Properties  Since each successive factor group  Z i +1 / Z i in the upper central series is abelian, and the series is finite, every nilpotent group is a solvable group with a relatively simple structure.  Every subgroup of a nilpotent group of class n is nilpotent of class at most n ; 10 in addition, if f is a homomorphism of a nilpotent group of class n , then the image of f is nilpotent 11 of class at most n .  The following statements are equivalent for finite groups, 12 revealing some useful properties of nilpotency:   G is a nilpotent group.  If H is a proper subgroup of G , then H is a proper normal subgroup of N G ( H ) (the normalizer of H in G ). This is called the normalizer property and can be phrased simply as "normalizers grow".  Every maximal proper subgroup of G is normal.  G is the direct product of its Sylow subgroups .   The last statement can be extended to infinite groups: if G is a nilpotent group, then every Sylow subgroup G p of G is normal, and the direct product of these Sylow subgroups is the subgroup of all elements of finite order in G (see torsion subgroup ).  Many properties of nilpotent groups are shared by hypercentral groups .
