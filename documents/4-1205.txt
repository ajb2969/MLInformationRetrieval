Pentacontagon

In geometry, a pentacontagon or pentecontagon is a fifty-sided polygon.12 The sum of any pentacontagon's interior angles is 8640 degrees.
A regular pentacontagon is represented by Schl채fli symbol {50} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated 25-gon, t{25}, which alternates two types of edges.
Regular pentacontagon properties
One interior angle in a regular pentacontagon is 172.8째, meaning that one exterior angle would be 7.2째.
The area of a regular pentacontagon is (with )



and its inradius is



The circumradius of a regular pentacontagon is



A regular pentacontagon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge,3 and is not constructible even if the use of an angle trisector is allowed.4
Pentacontagram
A pentacontagram is a 50-sided star polygon. There are 9 regular forms given by Schl채fli symbols {50/3}, {50/7}, {50/9}, {50/11}, {50/13}, {50/17}, {50/19}, {50/21}, and {50/23}, as well as 16 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration.
