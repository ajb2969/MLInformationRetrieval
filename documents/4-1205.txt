   Pentacontagon      Pentacontagon   In geometry , a pentacontagon or pentecontagon is a fifty-sided polygon . 1 2 The sum of any pentacontagon's interior angles is 8640 degrees.  A regular pentacontagon is represented by Schläfli symbol {50} and can be constructed as a quasiregular truncated 25-gon, t{25}, which alternates two types of edges.  Regular pentacontagon properties  One interior angle in a regular pentacontagon is 172.8°, meaning that one exterior angle would be 7.2°.  The area of a regular pentacontagon is (with )      A  =    25  2    t  2    cot   π  50         A      25  2    superscript  t  2       π  50       A=\frac{25}{2}t^{2}\cot\frac{\pi}{50}     and its inradius is      r  =    1  2   t   cot   π  50         r      1  2   t      π  50       r=\frac{1}{2}t\cot\frac{\pi}{50}     The circumradius of a regular pentacontagon is      R  =    1  2   t   csc   π  50         R      1  2   t      π  50       R=\frac{1}{2}t\csc\frac{\pi}{50}     A regular pentacontagon is not constructible using a compass and straightedge , 3 and is not constructible even if the use of an angle trisector is allowed. 4  Pentacontagram  A pentacontagram is a 50-sided star polygon . There are 9 regular forms given by Schläfli symbols {50/3}, {50/7}, {50/9}, {50/11}, {50/13}, {50/17}, {50/19}, {50/21}, and {50/23}, as well as 16 compound star figures with the same vertex configuration .
