   Tangent space to a functor      Tangent space to a functor   In algebraic geometry, the tangent space to a functor generalizes the classical construction of a tangent space such as the Zariski tangent space . The construction is based on the following observation. 1 Let X be a scheme over a field k .   To give a     k   [  ϵ  ]    /    (  ϵ  )   2         k   delimited-[]  ϵ     superscript  ϵ  2     k[\epsilon]/(\epsilon)^{2}   -point of X is the same thing as to give a k - rational point  p of X (i.e., the residue field of p is k ) together with an element of     (    𝔪   X  ,  p    /   𝔪   X  ,  p   2    )   *     superscript     subscript  𝔪   X  p     superscript   subscript  𝔪   X  p    2       (\mathfrak{m}_{X,p}/\mathfrak{m}_{X,p}^{2})^{*}   ; i.e., a tangent vector at p .   (To see this, use the fact that any local homomorphism     𝒪  p   →    k   [  ϵ  ]    /    (  ϵ  )   2       normal-→   subscript  𝒪  p       k   delimited-[]  ϵ     superscript  ϵ  2      \mathcal{O}_{p}\to k[\epsilon]/(\epsilon)^{2}   must be of the form        δ  p  v   :    u  ↦    u   (  p  )    +   ϵ  v   (  u  )      ,   v  ∈   𝒪  p  *      .     normal-:   superscript   subscript  δ  p   v    formulae-sequence   maps-to  u      u  p     ϵ  v  u       v   superscript   subscript  𝒪  p         \delta_{p}^{v}:u\mapsto u(p)+\epsilon v(u),\quad v\in\mathcal{O}_{p}^{*}.   ) Let F be a functor from the category of k -algebras to the category of sets. Then, for any k -point    p  ∈   F   (  k  )        p    F  k     p\in F(k)   , the fiber of    π  :    F   (    k   [  ϵ  ]    /    (  ϵ  )   2    )    →   F   (  k  )        normal-:  π   normal-→    F      k   delimited-[]  ϵ     superscript  ϵ  2       F  k      \pi:F(k[\epsilon]/(\epsilon)^{2})\to F(k)   over p is called the tangent space to F at p . 2 The tangent space may be given the structure of a vector space over k . If F is a scheme X over k (i.e.,    F  =    Hom   Spec  k     (   Spec  -   ,  X  )        F    subscript  Hom   Spec  k     limit-from  Spec    X     F=\operatorname{Hom}_{\operatorname{Spec}k}(\operatorname{Spec}-,X)   ), then each v as above may be identified with a derivation at p and this gives the identification of     π   -  1     (  p  )        superscript  π    1    p    \pi^{-1}(p)   with the space of derivations at p and we recover the usual construction.  The construction may be thought of as defining an analog of the tangent bundle in the following way. 3 Let     T  X   =   X   (    k   [  ϵ  ]    /    (  ϵ  )   2    )         subscript  T  X     X      k   delimited-[]  ϵ     superscript  ϵ  2       T_{X}=X(k[\epsilon]/(\epsilon)^{2})   . Then, for any morphism    f  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  Y     f:X\to Y   of schemes over k , one sees      f  #    (   δ  p  v   )    =   δ   f   (  p  )     d   f  p    (  v  )            superscript  f  normal-#    superscript   subscript  δ  p   v     superscript   subscript  δ    f  p      d   subscript  f  p   v      f^{\#}(\delta_{p}^{v})=\delta_{f(p)}^{df_{p}(v)}   ; this shows that the map     T  X   →   T  Y      normal-→   subscript  T  X    subscript  T  Y     T_{X}\to T_{Y}   that f induces is precisely the differential of f under the above identification.
