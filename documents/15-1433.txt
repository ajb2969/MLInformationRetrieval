Tangent space to a functor

In algebraic geometry, the tangent space to a functor generalizes the classical construction of a tangent space such as the Zariski tangent space. The construction is based on the following observation.1 Let X be a scheme over a field k.

To give a 
 
 
 
 -point of X is the same thing as to give a k-rational point p of X (i.e., the residue field of p is k) together with an element of 
 
 
 
 ; i.e., a tangent vector at p.
 

(To see this, use the fact that any local homomorphism 
 
 
 
  must be of the form


 
 ) Let F be a functor from the category of k-algebras to the category of sets. Then, for any k-point 
 
 
 
 , the fiber of 
 
 
 
  over p is called the tangent space to F at p.2 The tangent space may be given the structure of a vector space over k. If F is a scheme X over k (i.e., 
 
 
 
 ), then each v as above may be identified with a derivation at p and this gives the identification of 
 
 
 
  with the space of derivations at p and we recover the usual construction.
The construction may be thought of as defining an analog of the tangent bundle in the following way.3 Let 
 
 
 
 . Then, for any morphism 
 
 
 
  of schemes over k, one sees 
 
 
 
 ; this shows that the map 
 
 
 
  that f induces is precisely the differential of f under the above identification.
