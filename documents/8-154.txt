   Regular part      Regular part   In mathematics , the regular part of a Laurent series consists of the series of terms with positive powers. 1 That is, if        f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =   -  ∞    ∞     a  n     (   z  -  c   )   n      ,        f  z     superscript   subscript     n             subscript  a  n    superscript    z  c   n       f(z)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}a_{n}(z-c)^{n},   then the regular part of this Laurent series is        ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n     (   z  -  c   )   n     .      superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript    z  c   n      \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}(z-c)^{n}.     In contrast, the series of terms with negative powers is the principal part . 2  References  "  Category:Complex analysis     . ↩
