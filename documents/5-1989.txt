   Variational perturbation theory      Variational perturbation theory   In mathematics , variational perturbation theory (VPT) is a mathematical method to convert divergent power series in a small expansion parameter, say      s  =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n    g  n         s    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript  g  n       s=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}g^{n}   , into a convergent series in powers      s  =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     b  n   /    (   g  ω   )   n         s    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  b  n    superscript   superscript  g  ω   n       s=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}b_{n}/(g^{\omega})^{n}   , where   ω   ω   \omega   is a critical exponent (the so-called index of "approach to scaling" introduced by Franz Wegner ). This is possible with the help of variational parameters , which are determined by optimization order by order in   g   g   g   . The partial sums are converted to convergent partial sums by a method developed in 1992. 1  Most perturbation expansions in quantum mechanics are divergent for any small coupling strength   g   g   g   . They can be made convergent by VPT (for details see the first textbook cited below). The convergence is exponentially fast. 2 3  After its success in quantum mechanics, VPT has been developed further to become an important mathematical tool in quantum field theory with its anomalous dimensions . 4 Applications focus on the theory of critical phenomena . It has led to the most accurate predictions of critical exponents . More details can be read here .
