   Mutual coherence (linear algebra)      Mutual coherence (linear algebra)   In linear algebra , the coherence 1 or mutual coherence 2 of a matrix  A is defined as the maximum absolute value of the cross-correlations between the columns of A .  Formally, let      a  1   ,  …  ,   a  m    ∈   ℂ  d         subscript  a  1   normal-…   subscript  a  m     superscript  ℂ  d     a_{1},\ldots,a_{m}\in{\mathbb{C}}^{d}   be the columns of the matrix A , which are assumed to be normalized such that      a  i  H    a  i    =  1.         superscript   subscript  a  i   H    subscript  a  i    1.    a_{i}^{H}a_{i}=1.   The mutual coherence of A is then defined as 3 4       M  =    max   1  ≤  i  ≠  j  ≤  m     |    a  i  H    a  j    |     .      M    subscript       1  i       j       m          superscript   subscript  a  i   H    subscript  a  j        M=\max_{1\leq i\neq j\leq m}\left|a_{i}^{H}a_{j}\right|.     A lower bound is 5      M  ≥     m  -  d    d   (   m  -  1   )          M        m  d     d    m  1        M\geq\sqrt{\frac{m-d}{d(m-1)}}   A deterministic matrix with the mutual coherence almost meeting the lower bound can be constructed by Weil's theorem . 6  The concept was introduced in a slightly less general framework by David Donoho and Xiaoming Huo, 7 and has since been used extensively in the field of sparse representations of signals . In particular, it is used as a measure of the ability of suboptimal algorithms such as matching pursuit and basis pursuit to correctly identify the true representation of a sparse signal. 8 9 10  See also   Compressed sensing  Restricted isometry property   References  Further reading   Mutual coherence  R1magic : R package providing mutual coherence computation.
