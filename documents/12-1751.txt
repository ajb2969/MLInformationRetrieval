Mutual coherence (linear algebra)

In linear algebra, the coherence1 or mutual coherence2 of a matrix A is defined as the maximum absolute value of the cross-correlations between the columns of A.
Formally, let 
 
 
 
  be the columns of the matrix A, which are assumed to be normalized such that 
 
 
 
  The mutual coherence of A is then defined as34



A lower bound is 5


 
  A deterministic matrix with the mutual coherence almost meeting the lower bound can be constructed by Weil's theorem.6
The concept was introduced in a slightly less general framework by David Donoho and Xiaoming Huo,7 and has since been used extensively in the field of sparse representations of signals. In particular, it is used as a measure of the ability of suboptimal algorithms such as matching pursuit and basis pursuit to correctly identify the true representation of a sparse signal.8910
