   Thick set      Thick set   In mathematics , a thick set is a set of integers that contains arbitrarily long intervals . That is, given a thick set   T   T   T   , for every    p  ∈  ℕ      p  ℕ    p\in\mathbb{N}   , there is some    n  ∈  ℕ      n  ℕ    n\in\mathbb{N}   such that     {  n  ,   n  +  1   ,   n  +  2   ,  …  ,   n  +  p   }   ⊂  T       n    n  1     n  2   normal-…    n  p    T    \{n,n+1,n+2,...,n+p\}\subset T   .
