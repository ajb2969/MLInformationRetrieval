   Multiplicity of infection      Multiplicity of infection   In microbiology , the multiplicity of infection or MOI is the ratio of agents (e.g. phage or more generally virus , bacteria ) to infection targets (e.g. cell ). For example, when referring to a group of cells inoculated with virus particles, the multiplicity of infection or MOI is the ratio of the number of virus particles to the number of target cells present in a defined space.  Interpretation  The actual number of viruses or bacteria that will enter any given cell is a statistical process: some cells may absorb more than one infectious agent while others may not absorb any. The probability that a cell will absorb   n   n   n   virus particles or bacteria when inoculated with an MOI of   m   m   m   can be calculated for a given population using a Poisson distribution . This application of Poisson's distribution was applied and described by Ellis and Delbrück. 1       P   (  n  )    =     m  n   ⋅   e   -  m      n  !          P  n      normal-⋅   superscript  m  n    superscript  e    m       n      P(n)=\frac{m^{n}\cdot e^{-m}}{n!}     where   m   m   m   is the multiplicity of infection or MOI,   n   n   n   is the number of infectious agents that enter the infection target, and    P   (  n  )       P  n    P(n)   is the probability that an infection target (a cell) will get infected by   n   n   n   infectious agents.  In fact the infectivity of the virus or bacteria in question will alter this relationship. One way around this is to use a functional definition of infectious particles rather than a strict count, such as a plaque forming unit for viruses.  For example, when an MOI of 1 (1 viral particle per cell) is used to infect a population of cells, the probability that a cell will not get infected is     P   (  0  )    =   36.79  %         P  0    percent  36.79     P(0)=36.79\%   , and the probability that it be infected by a single particle is     P   (  1  )    =   36.79  %         P  1    percent  36.79     P(1)=36.79\%   , by two particles is     P   (  2  )    =   18.39  %         P  2    percent  18.39     P(2)=18.39\%   , by three particles is     P   (  3  )    =   6.13  %         P  3    percent  6.13     P(3)=6.13\%   , and so on.  The average percentage of cells that will become infected as a result of inoculation with a given MOI can be obtained by realizing that it is simply    P   (  n  >  0  )   =  1  -  P   (  0  )      fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  n   0  normal-)    1   P   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)     P(n>0)=1-P(0)   . Hence, the average fraction of cells that will become infected following an inoculation with an MOI of   m   m   m   is given by:      P   (  n  >  0  )   =  1  -  P   (  n  =  0  )   =  1  -     m  0   ⋅   e   -  m      0  !    =  1  -   e   -  m       fragments  P   fragments  normal-(  n   0  normal-)    1   P   fragments  normal-(  n   0  normal-)    1      normal-⋅   superscript  m  0    superscript  e    m       0     1    superscript  e    m      P(n>0)=1-P(n=0)=1-\frac{m^{0}\cdot e^{-m}}{0!}=1-e^{-m}     which is approximately equal to   m   m   m   for small values of    m  ≪  1     much-less-than  m  1    m\ll 1   .  MOI Examples  As the MOI increases, the percentages of cells infected with at least one viral particle also increases.      MOI   % Infected       1.0   63.2%     2.0   86.5%     3.0   95.0%     4.0   98.2%     5.0   99.3%     6.0   99.8%     7.0   99.9%     8.0   ~100.0%     Fields' virology, Part 1 By Bernard N.
