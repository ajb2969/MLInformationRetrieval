<h1>John James Waterston</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>John James Waterston</strong> (1811 – 18 June 1883) was a <a href="Scotland" title="wikilink">Scottish</a> <a class="uri" href="physicist" title="wikilink">physicist</a>, a neglected pioneer of the <a href="kinetic_theory_of_gases" title="wikilink">kinetic theory of gases</a>.</p>
<h2 id="early-life">Early life</h2>

<p>Waterston's father, George, was an <a class="uri" href="Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a> <a href="sealing_wax" title="wikilink">sealing wax</a> manufacturer and stationer, a relative of the Sandeman family <a href="Robert_Sandeman_(theologian)" title="wikilink">Robert</a> and his brother, George. John was born, the sixth of nine children, into a family alive with interests in literature, science and music. He was educated at Edinburgh High School before becoming apprenticed as a <a href="civil_engineer" title="wikilink">civil engineer</a> to Messrs. Grainger and Miller. His employers encouraged him to attend lectures at the <a href="University_of_Edinburgh" title="wikilink">University of Edinburgh</a>. He studied mathematics and <a class="uri" href="physics" title="wikilink">physics</a> under Sir <a href="John_Leslie_(physicist)" title="wikilink">John Leslie</a> as well as attending lectures in <a class="uri" href="chemistry" title="wikilink">chemistry</a>, <a class="uri" href="anatomy" title="wikilink">anatomy</a> and surgery and becoming an active participant in the student literary society.</p>

<p>At age nineteen, Waterston published a paper proposing a <a href="Mechanical_explanations_of_gravitation" title="wikilink">mechanical explanation of gravitation</a>, accounting for <em><a href="action_at_a_distance_(physics)" title="wikilink">action at a distance</a></em> in terms of colliding particles and discussing interactions between linear and rotational motion that would play a part in his later kinetic theory.</p>

<p>Waterston moved to London at age twenty-one, where he worked as a railroad <a href="Surveyor_(surveying)" title="wikilink">surveyor</a>, becoming an associate of the <a href="Institution_of_Civil_Engineers" title="wikilink">Institution of Civil Engineers</a> and publishing a paper on a graphical method for planning <a href="engineering_geology" title="wikilink">earthworks</a>. The travel and disruption associated with his surveying work left Waterston little time to pursue his studies so he joined the <a class="uri" href="hydrography" title="wikilink">hydrography</a> department of the <a class="uri" href="Admiralty" title="wikilink">Admiralty</a> under <a href="Francis_Beaufort" title="wikilink">Francis Beaufort</a>. It was Beaufort who, in 1839, supported Waterston for the post of naval instructor for cadets of the <a href="British_East_India_Company" title="wikilink">East India Company</a> in <a class="uri" href="Bombay" title="wikilink">Bombay</a>. The posting worked well for Waterston who was able to pursue his reading and research at the library of <a href="Grant_Medical_College_and_Sir_Jamshedjee_Jeejebhoy_Group_of_Hospitals" title="wikilink">Grant College</a>.</p>
<h2 id="kinetic-theory">Kinetic theory</h2>

<p>While in <a class="uri" href="India" title="wikilink">India</a>, he first developed his kinetic theory, independently of earlier and equally neglected partial accounts by <a href="Daniel_Bernoulli" title="wikilink">Daniel Bernoulli</a> and <a href="John_Herapath" title="wikilink">John Herapath</a>. He published it, at his own expense, in his book <em>Thoughts on the Mental Functions</em> (1843). He correctly derived all the consequences of the premise that gas <a class="uri" href="pressure" title="wikilink">pressure</a> is a <a href="function_(mathematics)" title="wikilink">function</a> of the number of <a href="molecule" title="wikilink">molecules</a> per unit <a class="uri" href="volume" title="wikilink">volume</a>, <em>N</em>; molecular <a class="uri" href="mass" title="wikilink">mass</a>, <em>M</em>; and molecular mean-squared <a class="uri" href="velocity" title="wikilink">velocity</a>,

<p>He had been motivated to think of a <em>wave theory of heat</em> by analogy with the <a href="wave_theory_of_light" title="wikilink">wave theory of light</a> and some experiments by <a href="James_Forbes_(physicist)" title="wikilink">James Forbes</a> and <a href="Macedonio_Melloni" title="wikilink">Macedonio Melloni</a> on <a href="heat_transfer" title="wikilink">radiant heat</a>. His statement that <em>... in mixed media the mean square molecular velocity is inversely proportional to the specific weight of the molecules</em> has been seen as the first statement of the <a href="equipartition_theorem" title="wikilink">equipartition theorem</a> for translational motion. Waterston grasped that, while the <a href="kinetic_energy" title="wikilink">kinetic energy</a> of an individual molecule with velocity <em>v</em> is ½<em>mv</em>², heat energy is proportional to temperature, <em>T</em>. That insight led him to derive the <a href="ideal_gas_law" title="wikilink">ideal gas law</a>:</p>

<p>The publication made little impact, perhaps because of the title. He submitted his theory, under Beaufort's sponsorship, to the <a href="Royal_Society" title="wikilink">Royal Society</a> in 1845 but was rejected. Referee Sir <a href="John_William_Lubbock" title="wikilink">John William Lubbock</a> wrote <em>The paper is nothing but nonsense.</em></p>

<p>Unable to retrieve a copy of his paper (he had failed to make a copy for himself before submitting the paper to the Royal Society), he rewrote the work and sought to advertise it elsewhere, attracting little attention other than from <a href="William_John_Macquorn_Rankine" title="wikilink">William John Macquorn Rankine</a> and <a href="Hermann_von_Helmholtz" title="wikilink">Hermann von Helmholtz</a> through whom it may have influenced <a href="August_Krönig" title="wikilink">August Krönig</a>. The theory gained acceptance only when it was proposed by <a href="Rudolf_Clausius" title="wikilink">Rudolf Clausius</a> and <a href="James_Clerk_Maxwell" title="wikilink">James Clerk Maxwell</a> in the 1850s by which time Waterston's contribution had been forgotten.</p>
<h2 id="later-life">Later life</h2>

<p>He returned to Edinburgh in 1857 to pursue his own novel physical ideas but met with unyielding neglect and discouragement from the scientific establishment. Neglect was exacerbated by his own increasing reclusiveness and hostility to the learned societies. He worked on <a class="uri" href="acoustics" title="wikilink">acoustics</a>, <a class="uri" href="astronomy" title="wikilink">astronomy</a>, <a href="fluid_mechanics" title="wikilink">fluid mechanics</a> and <a class="uri" href="thermodynamics" title="wikilink">thermodynamics</a>.</p>

<p>He left his Edinburgh home on 18 June and drowned in a nearby canal, possibly falling into the canal due to heat stress from his astronomical observation activities.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="recognition-after-death">Recognition after death</h2>

<p>As discussed above, Waterston's paper submitted to the Royal Society was rejected. Some years after Waterston's death, <a href="Lord_Rayleigh" title="wikilink">Lord Rayleigh</a> (Secretary of Royal Society at that time) managed to dig it out from the archives of the Royal Society. Finally, Waterson's paper was published in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society in 1892. (Please see below.)</p>
