   Rubredoxin—NAD(P)(+) reductase      Rubredoxin—NAD(P)(+) reductase   In enzymology , a rubredoxin—NAD(P)+ reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   reduced rubredoxin + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   oxidized rubredoxin + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are reduced rubredoxin , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are oxidized rubredoxin , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on iron-sulfur proteins as donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is rubredoxin:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include rubredoxin-nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (phosphate) reductase , rubredoxin-nicotinamide adenine , dinucleotide phosphate reductase , NAD(P)+-rubredoxin oxidoreductase , and NAD(P)H-rubredoxin oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in fatty acid metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 1.18.1  Category:NADPH-dependent enzymes  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
