   Cartan connection      Cartan connection   In the mathematical field of differential geometry , a Cartan connection is a flexible generalization of the notion of an affine connection . It may also be regarded as a specialization of the general concept of a principal connection , in which the geometry of the principal bundle is tied to the geometry of the base manifold using a solder form . Cartan connections describe the geometry of manifolds modelled on homogeneous spaces .  The theory of Cartan connections was developed by √âlie Cartan , as part of (and a way of formulating) his method of moving frames ( rep√®re mobile ). 1 The main idea is to develop a suitable notion of the connection forms and curvature using moving frames adapted to the particular geometrical problem at hand. For instance, in relativity or Riemannian geometry, orthonormal frames are used to obtain a description of the Levi-Civita connection as a Cartan connection. For Lie groups, Maurer‚ÄìCartan frames are used to view the Maurer‚ÄìCartan form of the group as a Cartan connection.  Cartan reformulated the differential geometry of ( pseudo ) Riemannian geometry , as well as the differential geometry of manifolds equipped with some non-metric structure, including Lie groups and homogeneous spaces . The term Cartan connection most often refers to Cartan's formulation of a (pseudo-)Riemannian, affine , projective , or conformal connection . Although these are the most commonly used Cartan connections, they are special cases of a more general concept.  Cartan's approach seems at first to be coordinate dependent because of the choice of frames it involves. However, it is not, and the notion can be described precisely using the language of principal bundles. Cartan connections induce covariant derivatives and other differential operators on certain associated bundles, hence a notion of parallel transport. They have many applications in geometry and physics: see the method of moving frames , Cartan connection applications and Einstein‚ÄìCartan theory for some examples.  Introduction  At its roots, geometry consists of a notion of congruence between different objects in a space. In the late 19th century, notions of congruence were typically supplied by the action of a Lie group on space. Lie groups generally act quite rigidly, and so a Cartan geometry is a generalization of this notion of congruence to allow for curvature to be present. The flat Cartan geometries ‚Äî those with zero curvature ‚Äî are locally equivalent to homogeneous spaces, hence geometries in the sense of Klein.  A Klein geometry consists of a Lie group G together with a Lie subgroup H of G . Together G and H determine a homogeneous space  G / H , on which the group G acts by left-translation. Klein's aim was then to study objects living on the homogeneous space which were congruent by the action of G . A Cartan geometry extends the notion of a Klein geometry by attaching to each point of a manifold a copy of a Klein geometry, and to regard this copy as tangent to the manifold. Thus the geometry of the manifold is infinitesimally identical to that of the Klein geometry, but globally can be quite different. In particular, Cartan geometries no longer have a well-defined action of G on them. However, a Cartan connection supplies a way of connecting the infinitesimal model spaces within the manifold by means of parallel transport .  Motivation  Consider a smooth surface S in 3-dimensional Euclidean space R 3 . Near to any point, S can be approximated by its tangent plane at that point, which is an affine subspace of Euclidean space. The affine subspaces are model surfaces ‚Äî they are the simplest surfaces in R 3 , and are homogeneous under the Euclidean group of the plane, hence they are Klein geometries in the sense of Felix Klein 's Erlangen programme . Every smooth surface S has a unique affine plane tangent to it at each point. The family of all such planes in R 3 , one attached to each point of S , is called the congruence of tangent planes. A tangent plane can be "rolled" along S , and as it does so the point of contact traces out a curve on S . Conversely, given a curve on S , the tangent plane can be rolled along that curve. This provides a way to identify the tangent planes at different points along the curve by affine (in fact Euclidean) transformations, and is an example of a Cartan connection called an affine connection .  Another example is obtained by replacing the planes, as model surfaces, by spheres, which are homogeneous under the M√∂bius group of conformal transformations. There is no longer a unique sphere tangent to a smooth surface S at each point, since the radius of the sphere is undetermined. This can be fixed by supposing that the sphere has the same mean curvature as S at the point of contact. Such spheres can again be rolled along curves on S , and this equips S with another type of Cartan connection called a conformal connection .  Differential geometers in the late 19th and early 20th century were very interested in using model families such as planes or spheres to describe the geometry of surfaces. A family of model spaces attached to each point of a surface S is called a congruence : in the previous examples there is a canonical choice of such a congruence. A Cartan connection provides an identification between the model spaces in the congruence along any curve in S . An important feature of these identifications is that the point of contact of the model space with S  always moves with the curve. This generic condition is characteristic of Cartan connections.  In the modern treatment of affine connections, the point of contact is viewed as the origin in the tangent plane (which is then a vector space), and the movement of the origin is corrected by a translation, and so Cartan connections are not needed. However, there is no canonical way to do this in general: in particular for the conformal connection of a sphere congruence, it is not possible to separate the motion of the point of contact from the rest of the motion in a natural way.  In both of these examples the model space is a homogeneous space G / H .   In the first case, G / H is the affine plane, with G = Aff( R 2 ) the affine group of the plane, and H = GL(2) the corresponding general linear group.  In the second case, G / H is the conformal (or celestial ) sphere, with G = O + (3,1) the (orthochronous) Lorentz group , and H the stabilizer of a null line in R 3,1 .   The Cartan geometry of S consists of a copy of the model space G / H at each point of S (with a marked point of contact) together with a notion of "parallel transport" along curves which identifies these copies using elements of G . This notion of parallel transport is generic in the intuitive sense that the point of contact always moves along the curve.  In general, let G be a group with a subgroup H , and M a manifold of the same dimension as G / H . Then, roughly speaking, a Cartan connection on M is a G -connection which is generic with respect to a reduction to H .  Affine connections  An affine connection on a manifold M is a connection (principal bundle) on the frame bundle of M (or equivalently, a connection (vector bundle) on the tangent bundle of M ). A key aspect of the Cartan connection point of view is to elaborate this notion in the context of principal bundles (which could be called the "general or abstract theory of frames").  Let H be a Lie group . Then a principal H -bundle is a fiber bundle  P over M with a smooth action of H on P which is free and transitive on the fibers. Thus P is a smooth manifold with a smooth map œÄ : P ‚Üí M which looks locally like the trivial bundle  M √ó H ‚Üí M . The frame bundle of M is a principal GL( n )-bundle, while if M is a Riemannian manifold , then the orthonormal frame bundle is a principal O( n )-bundle.  Let R h denote the (right) action of h ‚àà H on P . The derivative of this action defines a vertical vector field on P for each element Œæ of   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   : if h ( t ) is a 1-parameter subgroup with h (0)= e (the identity element) and h '( 0 )= Œæ , then the corresponding vertical vector field is        X  Œæ   =      d   d  t     R   h   (  t  )      |    t  =  0     .       subscript  X  Œæ    evaluated-at      normal-d    normal-d  t     subscript  R    h  t       t  0      X_{\xi}=\frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}R_{h(t)}\biggr|_{t=0}.\,     A principal H -connection on P is a 1-form     œâ  :    T  P   ‚Üí  ùî•      normal-:  œâ   normal-‚Üí    T  P   ùî•     \omega\colon TP\to\mathfrak{h}   on P , with values in the Lie algebra    ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   of H , such that        Ad   (  h  )    (    R  h  *   œâ   )    =  œâ        Ad  h     superscript   subscript  R  h     œâ    œâ    \hbox{Ad}(h)(R_{h}^{*}\omega)=\omega     for any    Œæ  ‚àà  ùî•      Œæ  ùî•    \xi\in\mathfrak{h}   , œâ ( X Œæ ) = Œæ (identically on P ).   The intuitive idea is that œâ ( X ) provides a vertical component of X , using the isomorphism of the fibers of œÄ with H to identify vertical vectors with elements of   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   .  Frame bundles have additional structure called the solder form , which can be used to extend a principal connection on P to a trivialization of the tangent bundle of P called an absolute parallelism .  In general, suppose that M has dimension n and H acts on R n (this could be any n -dimensional real vector space). A solder form on a principal H -bundle P over M is an R n -valued 1-form Œ∏ : T P ‚Üí R n which is horizontal and equivariant so that it induces a bundle homomorphism from T M to the associated bundle  P √ó H  R n . This is furthermore required to be a bundle isomorphism. Frame bundles have a (canonical or tautological) solder form which sends a tangent vector X ‚àà T p P to the coordinates of d œÄ p ( X ) ‚àà T œÄ ( p ) M with respect to the frame p .  The pair ( œâ , Œ∏ ) (a principal connection and a solder form) defines a 1-form Œ∑ on P , with values in the Lie algebra   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   of the semidirect product  G of H with R n , which provides an isomorphism of each tangent space T p P with   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   . It induces a principal connection Œ± on the associated principal G -bundle P √ó H  G . This is a Cartan connection.  Cartan connections generalize affine connections in two ways.   The action of H on R n need not be effective. This allows, for example, the theory to include spin connections, in which H is the spin group Spin( n ) rather than the orthogonal group O( n ).  The group G need not be a semidirect product of H with R n .   Klein geometries as model spaces  Klein's Erlangen programme suggested that geometry could be regarded as a study of homogeneous spaces : in particular, it is the study of the many geometries of interest to geometers of 19th century (and earlier). A Klein geometry consisted of a space, along with a law for motion within the space (analogous to the Euclidean transformations of classical Euclidean geometry ) expressed as a Lie group of transformations . These generalized spaces turn out to be homogeneous smooth manifolds diffeomorphic to the quotient space of a Lie group by a Lie subgroup . The extra differential structure that these homogeneous spaces possess allows one to study and generalize their geometry using calculus.  The general approach of Cartan is to begin with such a smooth Klein geometry , given by a Lie group G and a Lie subgroup H , with associated Lie algebras   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   and   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   , respectively. Let P be the underlying principal homogeneous space of G . A Klein geometry is the homogeneous space given by the quotient P / H of P by the right action of H . There is a right H -action on the fibres of the canonical projection   œÄ : P ‚Üí P / H    given by R h g = gh . Moreover, each fibre of œÄ is a copy of H . P has the structure of a principal H -bundle over P / H . 2  A vector field X on P is vertical if d œÄ ( X ) = 0. Any Œæ ‚àà   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   gives rise to a canonical vertical vector field X Œæ by taking the derivative of the right action of the 1-parameter subgroup of H associated to Œæ. The Maurer-Cartan form  Œ∑ of P is the   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}    -valued one-form on P which identifies each tangent space with the Lie algebra. It has the following properties:   Ad( h ) R h * Œ∑ = Œ∑ for all h in H  Œ∑ ( X Œæ ) = Œæ for all Œæ in   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}     for all g ‚àà P , Œ∑ restricts a linear isomorphism of T g P with   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   (Œ∑ is an absolute parallelism on P ).   In addition to these properties, Œ∑ satisfies the structure (or structural ) equation        d  Œ∑   +     1  2     [  Œ∑  ,  Œ∑  ]     =  0.          d  Œ∑       1  2    Œ∑  Œ∑     0.    d\eta+\tfrac{1}{2}[\eta,\eta]=0.     Conversely, one can show that given a manifold M and a principal H -bundle P over M , and a 1-form Œ∑ with these properties, then P is locally isomorphic as an H -bundle to the principal homogeneous bundle G ‚Üí G / H . The structure equation is the integrability condition for the existence of such a local isomorphism.  A Cartan geometry is a generalization of a smooth Klein geometry, in which the structure equation is not assumed, but is instead used to define a notion of curvature . Thus the Klein geometries are said to be the flat models for Cartan geometries. 3  Cartan connections and pseudogroups  Cartan connections are closely related to pseudogroup structures on a manifold. Each is thought of as modelled on a Klein geometry G / H , in a manner similar to the way in which Riemannian geometry is modelled on Euclidean space . On a manifold M , one imagines attaching to each point of M a copy of the model space G / H . The symmetry of the model space is then built into the Cartan geometry or pseudogroup structure by positing that the model spaces of nearby points are related by a transformation in G . The fundamental difference between a Cartan geometry and pseudogroup geometry is that the symmetry for a Cartan geometry relates infinitesimally close points by an infinitesimal transformation in G (i.e., an element of the Lie algebra of G ) and the analogous notion of symmetry for a pseudogroup structure applies for points that are physically separated within the manifold.  The process of attaching spaces to points, and the attendant symmetries, can be concretely realized by using special coordinate systems . 4 To each point p ‚àà M , a neighborhood  U p of p is given along with a mapping œÜ p : U p ‚Üí G / H . In this way, the model space is attached to each point of M by realizing M locally at each point as an open subset of G / H . We think of this as a family of coordinate systems on M , parametrized by the points of M . Two such parametrized coordinate systems œÜ and œÜ‚Ä≤ are H -related if there is an element h p ‚àà H , parametrized by p , such that   œÜ‚Ä≤ p = h p œÜ p . 5    This freedom corresponds roughly to the physicists' notion of a gauge .  Nearby points are related by joining them with a curve. Suppose that p and p ‚Ä≤ are two points in M joined by a curve p t . Then p t supplies a notion of transport of the model space along the curve. 6 Let œÑ t : G / H ‚Üí G / H be the (locally defined) composite map   œÑ t = œÜ p t o œÜ p 0 ‚àí1 .   Intuitively, œÑ t is the transport map. A pseudogroup structure requires that œÑ t be a symmetry of the model space for each t : œÑ t ‚àà G . A Cartan connection requires only that the derivative of œÑ t be a symmetry of the model space: œÑ‚Ä≤ 0 ‚àà g , the Lie algebra of G .  Typical of Cartan, one motivation for introducing the notion of a Cartan connection was to study the properties of pseudogroups from an infinitesimal point of view. A Cartan connection defines a pseudogroup precisely when the derivative of the transport map œÑ‚Ä≤ can be integrated , thus recovering a true ( G -valued) transport map between the coordinate systems. There is thus an integrability condition at work, and Cartan's method for realizing integrability conditions was to introduce a differential form .  In this case, œÑ‚Ä≤ 0 defines a differential form at the point p as follows. For a curve Œ≥( t ) = p t in M starting at p , we can associate the tangent vector  X , as well as a transport map œÑ t Œ≥ . Taking the derivative determines a linear map       X  ‚Ü¶      d   d  t     œÑ  t  Œ≥    |    t  =  0    =   Œ∏   (  X  )    ‚àà  ùî§   .       maps-to  X   evaluated-at      d    d  t     superscript   subscript  œÑ  t   Œ≥      t  0           Œ∏  X        ùî§     X\mapsto\left.\frac{d}{dt}\tau_{t}^{\gamma}\right|_{t=0}=\theta(X)\in\mathfrak%
 {g}.   So Œ∏ defines a g -valued differential 1-form on M .  This form, however, is dependent on the choice of parametrized coordinate system. If h : U ‚Üí H is an H -relation between two parametrized coordinate systems œÜ and œÜ‚Ä≤, then the corresponding values of Œ∏ are also related by        Œ∏  p  ‚Ä≤   =    A  d   (   h  p   -  1    )    Œ∏  p    +    h  p  *    œâ  H      ,       subscript   superscript  Œ∏  normal-‚Ä≤   p       A  d   subscript   superscript  h    1    p    subscript  Œ∏  p       subscript   superscript  h    p    subscript  œâ  H       \theta^{\prime}_{p}=Ad(h^{-1}_{p})\theta_{p}+h^{*}_{p}\omega_{H},   where œâ H is the Maurer-Cartan form of H .  Formal definition  A Cartan geometry modelled on a homogeneous space G / H can be viewed as a deformation of this geometry which allows for the presence of curvature . For example:   a Riemannian manifold can be seen as a deformation of Euclidean space ;  a Lorentzian manifold can be seen as a deformation of Minkowski space ;  a conformal manifold can be seen as a deformation of the conformal sphere ;  a manifold equipped with an affine connection can be seen as a deformation of an affine space .   There are two main approaches to the definition. In both approaches, M is a smooth manifold of dimension n , H is a Lie group of dimension m , with Lie algebra   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   , and G is a Lie group G of dimension n + m , with Lie algebra   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   , containing H as a subgroup.  Definition via gauge transitions  A Cartan connection consists 7 8 of a coordinate atlas of open sets U in M , along with a g -valued 1-form Œ∏ U defined on each chart such that   Œ∏ U : T U ‚Üí g .  Œ∏ U mod h : T u U ‚Üí g / h is a linear isomorphism for every u ‚àà U .  For any pair of charts U and V in the atlas, there is a smooth mapping h : U ‚à© V ‚Üí H such that           Œ∏  V   =    A  d   (   h   -  1    )    Œ∏  U    +    h  *    œâ  H      ,       subscript  Œ∏  V       A  d   superscript  h    1     subscript  Œ∏  U       superscript  h     subscript  œâ  H       \theta_{V}=Ad(h^{-1})\theta_{U}+h^{*}\omega_{H},\,       where œâ H is the Maurer-Cartan form of H .   By analogy with the case when the Œ∏ U came from coordinate systems, condition 3 means that œÜ U is related to œÜ V by h .  The curvature of a Cartan connection consists of a system of 2-forms defined on the charts, given by        Œ©  U   =    d   Œ∏  U    +     1  2     [   Œ∏  U   ,   Œ∏  U   ]      .       subscript  normal-Œ©  U       d   subscript  Œ∏  U        1  2     subscript  Œ∏  U    subscript  Œ∏  U        \Omega_{U}=d\theta_{U}+\tfrac{1}{2}[\theta_{U},\theta_{U}].   Œ© U satisfy the compatibility condition:   If the forms Œ∏ U and Œ∏ V are related by a function h : U ‚à© V ‚Üí H , as above, then Œ© V = Ad( h ‚àí1 ) Œ© U    The definition can be made independent of the coordinate systems by forming the quotient space      P  =   (   ‚àê  U   U  √ó  H  )   /  ‚àº     fragments  P    fragments  normal-(   subscript  coproduct  U   U   H  normal-)    similar-to    P=(\coprod_{U}U\times H)/\sim   of the disjoint union over all U in the atlas. The equivalence relation ~ is defined on pairs ( x , h 1 ) ‚àà U 1 √ó H and ( x , h 2 ) ‚àà U 2 √ó H , by   ( x , h 1 ) ~ ( x , h 2 ) if and only if x ‚àà U 1 ‚à© U 2 , Œ∏ U 1 is related to Œ∏ U 2 by h , and h 2 = h ( x ) ‚àí1  h 1 .   Then P is a principal H -bundle on M , and the compatibility condition on the connection forms Œ∏ U implies that they lift to a g -valued 1-form Œ∑ defined on P (see below).  Definition via absolute parallelism  Let P be a principal H bundle over M . Then a Cartan connection 9 is a   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   -valued 1-form Œ∑ on P such that   for all h in H , Ad( h ) R h * Œ∑ = Œ∑  for all Œæ in   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   , Œ∑ ( X Œæ ) = Œæ  for all p in P , the restriction of Œ∑ defines a linear isomorphism from the tangent space T p P to   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   .   The last condition is sometimes called the Cartan condition : it means that Œ∑ defines an absolute parallelism on P . The second condition implies that Œ∑ is already injective on vertical vectors and that the 1-form Œ∑ mod   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   , with values in    ùî§  /  ùî•      ùî§  ùî•    \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}   , is horizontal. The vector space    ùî§  /  ùî•      ùî§  ùî•    \mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}   is a representation of H using the adjoint representation of H on   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   , and the first condition implies that Œ∑ mod   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   is equivariant. Hence it defines a bundle homomorphism from T M to the associated bundle     P   √ó  H   ùî§   /  ùî•        subscript   H   P  ùî§   ùî•    P\times_{H}\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}   . The Cartan condition is equivalent to this bundle homomorphism being an isomorphism, so that Œ∑ mod   ùî•   ùî•   \mathfrak{h}   is a solder form .  The curvature of a Cartan connection is the   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   -valued 2-form Œ© defined by       Œ©  =    d  Œ∑   +     1  2     [   Œ∑  ‚àß  Œ∑   ]      .      normal-Œ©      d  Œ∑       1  2    delimited-[]    Œ∑  Œ∑        \Omega=d\eta+\tfrac{1}{2}[\eta\wedge\eta].     Note that this definition of a Cartan connection looks very similar to that of a principal connection . There are several important differences, however. First, the 1-form Œ∑ takes values in g , but is only equivariant under the action of H . Indeed, it cannot be equivariant under the full group G because there is no G bundle and no G action. Secondly, the 1-form is an absolute parallelism, which intuitively means that Œ∑ yields information about the behavior of additional directions in the principal bundle (rather than simply being a projection operator onto the vertical space). Concretely, the existence of a solder form binds (or solders) the Cartan connection to the underlying differential topology of the manifold.  An intuitive interpretation of the Cartan connection in this form is that it determines a fracturing of the tautological principal bundle associated to a Klein geometry. Thus Cartan geometries are deformed analogues of Klein geometries. This deformation is roughly a prescription for attaching a copy of the model space G / H to each point of M and thinking of that model space as being tangent to (and infinitesimally identical with) the manifold at a point of contact. The fibre of the tautological bundle G ‚Üí G / H of the Klein geometry at the point of contact is then identified with the fibre of the bundle P . Each such fibre (in G ) carries a Maurer-Cartan form for G , and the Cartan connection is a way of assembling these Maurer-Cartan forms gathered from the points of contact into a coherent 1-form Œ∑ defined on the whole bundle. The fact that only elements of H contribute to the Maurer-Cartan equation Ad( h ) R h * Œ∑ = Œ∑ has the intuitive interpretation that any other elements of G would move the model space away from the point of contact, and so no longer be tangent to the manifold.  From the Cartan connection, defined in these terms, one can recover a Cartan connection as a system of 1-forms on the manifold (as in the gauge definition) by taking a collection of local trivializations of P given as sections s U : U ‚Üí P and letting Œ∏ U = s * Œ∑ be the pullbacks of the Cartan connection along the sections.  Cartan connections as principal connections  Another way in which to define a Cartan connection is as a principal connection on a certain principal G -bundle. From this perspective, a Cartan connection consists of   a principal G -bundle Q over M  a principal G -connection Œ± on Q (the Cartan connection)  a principal H -subbundle P of Q (i.e., a reduction of structure group)   such that the pullback  Œ∑ of Œ± to P satisfies the Cartan condition.  The principal connection Œ± on Q can be recovered from the form Œ∑ by taking Q to be the associated bundle P √ó H  G . Conversely, the form Œ∑ can be recovered from Œ± by pulling back along the inclusion P ‚äÇ Q .  Since Œ± is a principal connection, it induces a connection on any associated bundle to Q . In particular, the bundle Q √ó G  G / H of homogeneous spaces over M , whose fibers are copies of the model space G / H , has a connection. The reduction of structure group to H is equivalently given by a section s of E = Q √ó G  G / H . The fiber of     P   √ó  H   ùî§   /  ùî•        subscript   H   P  ùî§   ùî•    P\times_{H}\mathfrak{g}/\mathfrak{h}   over x in M may be viewed as the tangent space at s ( x ) to the fiber of Q √ó G  G / H over x . Hence the Cartan condition has the intuitive interpretation that the model spaces are tangent to M along the section s . Since this identification of tangent spaces is induced by the connection, the marked points given by s always move under parallel transport.  Definition by an Ehresmann connection  Yet another way to define a Cartan connection is with an Ehresmann connection on the bundle E = Q √ó G  G / H of the preceding section. 10 A Cartan connection then consists of   A fibre bundle œÄ : E ‚Üí M with fibre G / H and vertical space V E ‚äÇ T E .  A section s : M ‚Üí E .  A G-connection Œ∏ : T E ‚Üí V E such that     s * Œ∏ x : T x M ‚Üí V s ( x ) E is a linear isomorphism of vector spaces for all x ‚àà M .     This definition makes rigorous the intuitive ideas presented in the introduction. First, the preferred section s can be thought of as identifying a point of contact between the manifold and the tangent space. The last condition, in particular, means that the tangent space of M at x is isomorphic to the tangent space of the model space at the point of contact. So the model spaces are, in this way, tangent to the manifold.  This definition also brings prominently into focus the idea of development . If x t is a curve in M , then the Ehresmann connection on E supplies an associated parallel transport map œÑ t : E x t ‚Üí E x 0 from the fibre over the endpoint of the curve to the fibre over the initial point. In particular, since E is equipped with a preferred section s , the points s ( x t ) transport back to the fibre over x 0 and trace out a curve in E x 0 . This curve is then called the development of the curve x t .  To show that this definition is equivalent to the others above, one must introduce a suitable notion of a moving frame for the bundle E . In general, this is possible for any G -connection on a fibre bundle with structure group G . See Ehresmann connection#Associated bundles for more details.  Special Cartan connections  Reductive Cartan connections  Let P be a principal H -bundle on M , equipped with a Cartan connection Œ∑ : T P ‚Üí g . If g is a reductive module for H , meaning that g admits an Ad( H )-invariant splitting of vector spaces g = h ‚äï m , then the m -component of Œ∑ generalizes the solder form for an affine connection . 11 In detail, Œ∑ splits into h and m components:   Œ∑ = Œ∑ h + Œ∑ m .   Note that the 1-form Œ∑ h is a principal H -connection on the original Cartan bundle P . Moreover, the 1-form Œ∑ m satisfies:   Œ∑ m ( X ) = 0 for every vertical vector X ‚àà T P . (Œ∑ m is horizontal .)  R h * Œ∑ m = Ad( h ‚àí1 )Œ∑ m for every h ‚àà H . (Œ∑ m is equivariant under the right H -action.)   In other words, Œ∑ is a solder form for the bundle P .  Hence, P equipped with the form Œ∑ m defines a (first order) H -structure on M . The form Œ∑ h defines a connection on the H -structure.  Parabolic Cartan connections  If g is a semisimple Lie algebra with parabolic subalgebra  p (i.e., p contains a maximal solvable subalgebra of g ) and G and P are associated Lie groups, then a Cartan connection modelled on ( G , P , g , p ) is called a parabolic Cartan geometry , or simply a parabolic geometry . A distinguishing feature of parabolic geometries is a Lie algebra structure on its cotangent spaces : this arises because the perpendicular subspace p ‚ä• of p in g with respect to the Killing form of g is a subalgebra of p , and the Killing form induces a natural duality between p ‚ä• and g / p . Thus the bundle associated to p ‚ä• is isomorphic to the cotangent bundle .  Parabolic geometries include many of those of interest in research and applications of Cartan connections, such as the following examples:   Conformal connections : Here G = SO ( p +1, q +1), and P is the stabilizer of a null ray in R n+2 .  Projective connections : Here G = PGL (n+1) and P is the stabilizer of a point in RP n .  CR structures and Cartan-Chern-Tanaka connections: G = PSU ( p +1, q +1), P = stabilizer of a point on the projective null hyperquadric .  Contact projective connections: 12 Here G = SP (2n+2) and P is the stabilizer of the ray generated by the first standard basis vector in R n+2 .  Generic rank 2 distributions on 5-manifolds: Here G = Aut ( O s ) is the automorphism group of the algebra O s of split octonions , a closed subgroup of SO (3,4), and P is the intersection of G with the stabilizer of the isotropic line spanned by the first standard basis vector in R 7 viewed as the purely imaginary split octonions (orthogonal complement of the unit element in O s ). 13   Associated differential operators  Covariant differentiation  Suppose that M is a Cartan geometry modelled on G / H , and let ( Q , Œ± ) be the principal G -bundle with connection, and ( P , Œ∑ ) the corresponding reduction to H with Œ∑ equal to the pullback of Œ± . Let V a representation of G , and form the vector bundle V = Q √ó G  V over M . Then the principal G -connection Œ± on Q induces a covariant derivative on V , which is a first order linear differential operator       ‚àá  :     Œ©  M  0    (  ùêï  )    ‚Üí    Œ©  M  1    (  ùêï  )      ,     normal-:  normal-‚àá   normal-‚Üí     subscript   superscript  normal-Œ©  0   M   ùêï      subscript   superscript  normal-Œ©  1   M   ùêï      \nabla\colon\Omega^{0}_{M}(\mathbf{V})\to\Omega^{1}_{M}(\mathbf{V}),   where     Œ©  M  k    (  ùêï  )        subscript   superscript  normal-Œ©  k   M   ùêï    \Omega^{k}_{M}(\mathbf{V})   denotes the space of k -forms on M with values in V so that     Œ©  M  0    (  ùêï  )        subscript   superscript  normal-Œ©  0   M   ùêï    \Omega^{0}_{M}(\mathbf{V})   is the space of sections of V and     Œ©  M  1    (  ùêï  )        subscript   superscript  normal-Œ©  1   M   ùêï    \Omega^{1}_{M}(\mathbf{V})   is the space of sections of Hom(T M , V ). For any section v of V , the contraction of the covariant derivative ‚àá v with a vector field X on M is denoted ‚àá X v and satisfies the following Leibniz rule:        ‚àá  X    (   f  v   )    =    d  f   (  X  )   v   +   f    ‚àá  X   v           subscript  normal-‚àá  X     f  v        d  f  X  v     f    subscript  normal-‚àá  X   v       \nabla_{X}(fv)=df(X)v+f\nabla_{X}v   for any smooth function f on M .  The covariant derivative can also be constructed from the Cartan connection Œ∑ on P . In fact, constructing it in this way is slightly more general in that V need not be a fully fledged representation of G . 14 Suppose instead that that V is a (   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   , H )-module: a representation of the group H with a compatible representation of the Lie algebra   ùî§   ùî§   \mathfrak{g}   . Recall that a section v of the induced vector bundle V over M can be thought of as an H -equivariant map P ‚Üí V . This is the point of view we shall adopt. Let X be a vector field on M . Choose any right-invariant lift    X  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  X    \bar{X}   to the tangent bundle of P . Define        ‚àá  X   v   =    d  v   (   X  ¬Ø   )    +    Œ∑   (   X  ¬Ø   )    ‚ãÖ  v          subscript  normal-‚àá  X   v       d  v   normal-¬Ø  X     normal-‚ãÖ    Œ∑   normal-¬Ø  X    v      \nabla_{X}v=dv(\bar{X})+\eta(\bar{X})\cdot v   .  In order to show that ‚àá v is well defined, it must:   be independent of the chosen lift    X  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  X    \bar{X}     be equivariant, so that it descends to a section of the bundle V .   For (1), the ambiguity in selecting a right-invariant lift of X is a transformation of the form    X  ‚Ü¶   X  +   X  Œæ       maps-to  X    X   subscript  X  Œæ      X\mapsto X+X_{\xi}   where    X  Œæ     subscript  X  Œæ    X_{\xi}   is the right-invariant vertical vector field induced from    Œæ  ‚àà  ùî•      Œæ  ùî•    \xi\in\mathfrak{h}   . So, calculating the covariant derivative in terms of the new lift     X  ¬Ø   +   X  Œæ        normal-¬Ø  X    subscript  X  Œæ     \bar{X}+X_{\xi}   , one has       ‚àá  X   v  =  d  v   (   X  ¬Ø   +   X  Œæ   )   +  Œ∑   (   X  ¬Ø   +   X  Œæ   )   )  ‚ãÖ  v     fragments   subscript  normal-‚àá  X   v   d  v   fragments  normal-(   normal-¬Ø  X     subscript  X  Œæ   normal-)    Œ∑   fragments  normal-(   normal-¬Ø  X     subscript  X  Œæ   normal-)   normal-)  normal-‚ãÖ  v    \nabla_{X}v=dv(\bar{X}+X_{\xi})+\eta(\bar{X}+X_{\xi}))\cdot v          =    d  v   (   X  ¬Ø   )    +   d  v   (   X  Œæ   )    +    Œ∑   (   X  ¬Ø   )    ‚ãÖ  v   +   Œæ  ‚ãÖ  v        absent      d  v   normal-¬Ø  X      d  v   subscript  X  Œæ     normal-‚ãÖ    Œ∑   normal-¬Ø  X    v    normal-‚ãÖ  Œæ  v      =dv(\bar{X})+dv(X_{\xi})+\eta(\bar{X})\cdot v+\xi\cdot v          =    d  v   (   X  ¬Ø   )    +    Œ∑   (   X  ¬Ø   )    ‚ãÖ  v        absent      d  v   normal-¬Ø  X     normal-‚ãÖ    Œ∑   normal-¬Ø  X    v      =dv(\bar{X})+\eta(\bar{X})\cdot v     since      Œæ  ‚ãÖ  v   +   d  v   (   X  Œæ   )     =  0         normal-‚ãÖ  Œæ  v     d  v   subscript  X  Œæ     0    \xi\cdot v+dv(X_{\xi})=0   by taking the differential of the equivariance property      h  ‚ãÖ   R  h  *    v   =  v         normal-‚ãÖ  h   superscript   subscript  R  h      v   v    h\cdot R_{h}^{*}v=v   at h equal to the identity element.  For (2), observe that since v is equivariant and    X  ¬Ø     normal-¬Ø  X    \bar{X}   is right-invariant,    d  v   (   X  ¬Ø   )       d  v   normal-¬Ø  X     dv(\bar{X})   is equivariant. On the other hand, since Œ∑ is also equivariant, it follows that     Œ∑   (   X  ¬Ø   )    ‚ãÖ  v     normal-‚ãÖ    Œ∑   normal-¬Ø  X    v    \eta(\bar{X})\cdot v   is equivariant as well.  The fundamental or universal derivative  Suppose that V is only a representation of the subgroup H and not necessarily the larger group G . Let     Œ©  k    (  P  ,  V  )        superscript  normal-Œ©  k    P  V     \Omega^{k}(P,V)   be the space of V -valued differential k -forms on P . In the presence of a Cartan connection, there is a canonical isomorphism      œÜ  :     Œ©  k    (  P  ,  V  )    ‚âÖ    Œ©  0    (  P  ,   V  ‚äó    ‚ãÄ  k    ùî§  *     )        normal-:  œÜ       superscript  normal-Œ©  k    P  V       superscript  normal-Œ©  0    P   tensor-product  V    superscript   k    superscript  ùî§           \varphi\colon\Omega^{k}(P,V)\cong\Omega^{0}(P,V\otimes\bigwedge\nolimits^{k}%

For each k , the exterior derivative is a first order operator differential operator      d  :     Œ©  k    (  P  ,  V  )    ‚Üí    Œ©   k  +  1     (  P  ,  V  )        normal-:  d   normal-‚Üí     superscript  normal-Œ©  k    P  V       superscript  normal-Œ©    k  1     P  V       d\colon\Omega^{k}(P,V)\rightarrow\Omega^{k+1}(P,V)\,   and so, for k =0, it defines a differential operator        œÜ  ‚àò  d   :     Œ©  0    (  P  ,  V  )    ‚Üí    Œ©  0    (  P  ,   V  ‚äó   ùî§  *    )      .     normal-:    œÜ  d    normal-‚Üí     superscript  normal-Œ©  0    P  V       superscript  normal-Œ©  0    P   tensor-product  V   superscript  ùî§          \varphi\circ d\colon\Omega^{0}(P,V)\rightarrow\Omega^{0}(P,V\otimes\mathfrak{g%

It follows that this composite descends to a first order differential operator D from sections of V = P √ó H V to sections of the bundle    P   √ó  H    (   ùêï  ‚äó   ùî§  *    )       subscript   H   P   tensor-product  ùêï   superscript  ùî§       P\times_{H}(\mathbf{V}\otimes\mathfrak{g}^{*})   . This is called the fundamental or universal derivative, or fundamental D-operator.

In particular, the high point of his remarkable 1910 paper on Pfaffian systems in five variables is the construction of a Cartan connection modelled on a 5-dimensional homogeneous space for the exceptional Lie group  G 2 , which he and Engels had discovered independently in 1894. ‚Ü©  . ‚Ü©  See R.
