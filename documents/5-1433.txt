   Stirling transform      Stirling transform   In combinatorial  mathematics , the Stirling transform of a sequence { a n : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } of numbers is the sequence { b n : n = 1, 2, 3, ... } given by        b  n   =    ∑   k  =  1   n     {     n      k     }    a  k      ,       subscript  b  n     superscript   subscript     k  1    n        n    k      subscript  a  k       b_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}\left\{\begin{matrix}n\\
 k\end{matrix}\right\}a_{k},     where    {     n      k     }       n    k      \left\{\begin{matrix}n\\
 k\end{matrix}\right\}   is the Stirling number of the second kind, also denoted S ( n , k ) (with a capital S ), which is the number of partitions of a set of size n into k parts.  The inverse transform is        a  n   =    ∑   k  =  1   n    s   (  n  ,  k  )    b  k      ,       subscript  a  n     superscript   subscript     k  1    n     s   n  k    subscript  b  k       a_{n}=\sum_{k=1}^{n}s(n,k)b_{k},     where s ( n , k ) (with a lower-case s ) is a Stirling number of the first kind.  Berstein and Sloane (cited below) state "If a n is the number of objects in some class with points labeled 1, 2, ..., n (with all labels distinct, i.e. ordinary labeled structures), then b n is the number of objects with points labeled 1, 2, ..., n (with repetitions allowed)."  If       f   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      a  n    n  !     x  n           f  x     superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  a  n     n     superscript  x  n       f(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{a_{n}\over n!}x^{n}     is a formal power series (note that the lower bound of summation is 1, not 0), and       g   (  x  )    =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞      b  n    n  !     x  n           g  x     superscript   subscript     n  1           subscript  b  n     n     superscript  x  n       g(x)=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}{b_{n}\over n!}x^{n}     with a n and b n as above, then        g   (  x  )    =   f   (    e  x   -  1   )     .        g  x     f     superscript  e  x   1      g(x)=f(e^{x}-1).\,     See also   Binomial transform  List of factorial and binomial topics   References    .
