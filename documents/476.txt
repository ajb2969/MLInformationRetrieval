   Cholest-5-ene-3beta,7alpha-diol 3beta-dehydrogenase      Cholest-5-ene-3beta,7alpha-diol 3beta-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol 3β-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction 1   cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol + NAD +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one + NADH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol and NAD + , whereas its 3 products are 7α-hydroxycholest-4-en-3-one , NADH , and H + .  The systematic name of this enzyme class is cholest-5-ene-3β,7α-diol:NAD + 3-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called 3β-hydroxy-Δ5-C27-steroid oxidoreductase . The human version of this enzyme is known as hydroxy-Δ-5-steroid dehydrogenase, 3 β- and steroid delta-isomerase 7 or HSD3B7 which is encoded by the HSD3B7  gene . 2 3  Function  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. This enzyme is involved in the initial stages of the synthesis of bile acids from cholesterol and a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily. This enzyme is a membrane-associated endoplasmic reticulum protein which is active against 7-alpha hydrosylated sterol substrates. 4  Clinical significance  Mutations in the HSD3B7 gene are associated with a congenital bile acid synthesis defect which leads to neonatal cholestasis , a form of progressive liver disease. 5  See also   3-beta-HSD   References  "  Category:EC 1.1.1  Category:NADH-dependent enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure     ↩  ↩  ↩   ↩
