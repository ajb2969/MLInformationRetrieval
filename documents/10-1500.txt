Leghemoglobin reductase

In enzymology, a leghemoglobin reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

NAD(P)H + H+ + 2 ferrileghemoglobin 
 
 
 
  NAD(P)+ + 2 ferroleghemoglobin
 

The 4 substrates of this enzyme are NADH, NADPH, H+, and ferrileghemoglobin, whereas its 3 products are NAD+, NADP+, and ferroleghemoglobin.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with a heme protein as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NAD(P)H:ferrileghemoglobin oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called ferric leghemoglobin reductase.
