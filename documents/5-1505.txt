   Gires–Tournois etalon      Gires–Tournois etalon   In optics , a Gires–Tournois etalon is a transparent plate with two reflecting surfaces, one of which has very high reflectivity. Due to multiple-beam interference , light incident on a Gires–Tournois etalon is (almost) completely reflected, but has an effective phase shift that depends strongly on the wavelength of the light.  The complex amplitude reflectivity of a Gires–Tournois etalon is given by      r  =   -     r  1   -   e   -   i  δ       1  -    r  1    e   -   i  δ             r         subscript  r  1    superscript  e      i  δ        1     subscript  r  1    superscript  e      i  δ           r=-\frac{r_{1}-e^{-i\delta}}{1-r_{1}e^{-i\delta}}     where r 1 is the complex amplitude reflectivity of the first surface,     δ  =     4  π   λ   n  t   cos   θ  t         δ        4  π   λ   n  t     subscript  θ  t       \delta=\frac{4\pi}{\lambda}nt\cos\theta_{t}      n is the index of refraction of the plate  t is the thickness of the plate  θ t is the angle of refraction the light makes within the plate, and  λ is the wavelength of the light in vacuum.   Nonlinear effective phase shift  (Figure)  Nonlinear phase shift Φ as a function of δ for different R values: (a) R = 0, (b) R = 0.1, (c) R = 0.5, and (d) R = 0.9.   Suppose that    r  1     subscript  r  1    r_{1}   is real. Then     |  r  |   =  1        r   1    |r|=1   , independent of   δ   δ   \delta   . This indicates that all the incident energy is reflected and intensity is uniform. However, the multiple reflection causes a nonlinear  phase shift    Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   .  To show this effect, we assume    r  1     subscript  r  1    r_{1}   is real and     r  1   =   R        subscript  r  1     R     r_{1}=\sqrt{R}   , where   R   R   R   is the intensity reflectivity of the first surface. Define the effective phase shift   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   through       r  =   e   i  Φ     .      r   superscript  e    i  normal-Φ      r=e^{i\Phi}.     One obtains       tan   (   Φ  2   )    =   -     1  +   R     1  -   R      tan   (   δ  2   )              normal-Φ  2            1    R      1    R         δ  2        \tan\left(\frac{\Phi}{2}\right)=-\frac{1+\sqrt{R}}{1-\sqrt{R}}\tan\left(\frac{%
 \delta}{2}\right)     For R = 0, no reflection from the first surface and the resultant nonlinear phase shift is equal to the round-trip phase change (    Φ  =  δ      normal-Φ  δ    \Phi=\delta   ) – linear response. However, as can be seen, when R is increased, the nonlinear phase shift   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   gives the nonlinear response to   δ   δ   \delta   and shows step-like behavior.
