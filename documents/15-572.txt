Rotatum

In physics, Rotatum is the derivative of torque with respect to time. Expressed as an equation, rotatum Ρ is:



where τ is torque and 
 
 
 
  is the derivative with respect to time 
 
 
 
 .
The term rotatum is not universally recognized but is commonly used. this word derived from Latin word rotātus meaning to rotate.  The units of rotatum are force times distance per time, or equivalently, mass times length squared per time cubed; in the SI unit system this is kilogram metre squared per second cubed (kg·m2/s3), or Newtons times meter per second (N·m/s).
Relation to other physical quantities
Newton's second law for angular motion says that:



where L is angular momentum, so if we combine the above two equations:



where 
 
 
 
  is moment of Inertia and 
 
 
 
  is angular velocity. If the moment of inertia isn't changing over time (i.e. it's constant), then:



which can also be written as:



where ς is Angular jerk.
