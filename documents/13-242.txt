   Volume conjecture      Volume conjecture   In the branch of mathematics called knot theory , the volume conjecture is the following open problem that relates quantum invariants of knots to the hyperbolic geometry of knot complements .  Let O denote the unknot . For any knot K let     ⟨  K  ⟩   N     subscript   delimited-⟨⟩  K   N    \langle K\rangle_{N}   be Kashaev's invariant of   K   K   K   ; this invariant coincides with the following evaluation of the   N   N   N   - colored Jones polynomial      J   K  ,  N     (  q  )        subscript  J   K  N    q    J_{K,N}(q)   of   K   K   K   :    \frac{J_{K,N}(q)}{J_{O,N}(q)}.| 1 }}    Then the volume conjecture states that      where vol( K ) denotes the hyperbolic volume of the complement of K in the 3-sphere .  Kashaev's Observation  observed that the asymptotic behavior of a certain state sum of knots gives the hyperbolic volume     vol   (  K  )      vol  K    \operatorname{vol}(K)   of the complement of knots   K   K   K   and showed that it is true for the knots    4  1     subscript  4  1    4_{1}   ,    5  2     subscript  5  2    5_{2}   and    6  1     subscript  6  1    6_{1}   . He conjectured that for the general hyperbolic knots the formula (2) would hold. His invariant for a knot   K   K   K   is based on the theory of quantum dilogarithms at the   N   N   N   -th root of unity,    q  =   exp   (    2  π  i   /  N   )        q        2  π  i   N      q=\exp{(2\pi i/N)}   .  Colored Jones Invariant  had firstly pointed out that Kashaev's invariant is related to Jones polynomial by replacing q with the 2N-root of unity, namely,    exp    i  π   N           i  π   N     \exp{\frac{i\pi}{N}}   . They used R-matrix as the discrete fourier transformation for the equivalence of these two values.  The volume conjecture is important for knot theory . In the section 5 of this paper they state that:   Assuming the volume conjecture, every knot that is different from the trivial knot has at least one different Vassiliev (finite type) invariant .   Relation to Chern-Simons theory  Using complexification  rewrote the formula (1) into      where    C  S   (    S  3   \  K   )       C  S   normal-\   superscript  S  3   K     CS(S^{3}\backslash K)   is called Chern-Simons invariant. They showed that there is a clear relation between the complexified colored Jones polynomial and Chern-Simons theory from mathematical point of view.  References    .   .   .   .
