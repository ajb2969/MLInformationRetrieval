   LH (complexity)      LH (complexity)   In computational complexity , the logarithmic time hierarchy ( LH ) is the complexity class of all computational problems solvable in a logarithmic amount of computation time on an alternating Turing machine with a bounded number of alternations. It is a special case of the hierarchy of bounded alternating Turing machines . It is equal to FO and to FO-uniform AC0 . 1  The   i   i   i   th level of the logarithmic time hierarchy is the set of languages recognised by alternating Turing machines in logarithmic time with random access and    i  -  1      i  1    i-1   alternations, beginning with an existential state . LH is the union of all levels.  References  "  Category:Complexity classes     â†©
