   Trans-zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase      Trans-zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a trans-zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + trans-zeatin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + O-beta-D-glucosyl-trans-zeatin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and trans-zeatin , whereas its two products are UDP and O-beta-D-glucosyl-trans-zeatin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:trans-zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include zeatin O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-zeatin O-glucosyltransferase , and zeatin O-glucosyltransferase .
