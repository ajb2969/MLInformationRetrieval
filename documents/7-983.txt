   IP set      IP set   In mathematics , an IP set is a set of natural numbers which contains all finite sums of some infinite set .  The finite sums of a set D of natural numbers are all those numbers that can be obtained by adding up the elements of some finite nonempty subset of D . The set of all finite sums over D is often denoted as FS( D ).  A set A of natural numbers is an IP set if there exists an infinite set D such that FS( D ) is a subset of A .  Some authors give a slightly different definition of IP sets: They require that FS( D ) equal A instead of just being a subset.  Sources disagree on the origin of the name IP set. Some claim it was coined by Furstenberg and Weiss to abbreviate " i nfinite-dimensional p arallelepiped ", while others claim that it abbreviates " i dem p otent" (since a set is IP if and only if it is a member of an idempotent ultrafilter ).  Hindman's theorem  If    S    S   S\,   is an IP set and    S  =    C  1   ∪   C  2   ∪  …  ∪   C  n        S     subscript  C  1    subscript  C  2   normal-…   subscript  C  n      S=C_{1}\cup C_{2}\cup...\cup C_{n}   , then at least one     C  i      subscript  C  i    C_{i}\,   contains an IP set. This is known as Hindman's theorem or the finite sums theorem .  Since the set of natural numbers itself is an IP set and partitions can also be seen as colorings, one can reformulate a special case of Hindman's theorem in more familiar terms: Suppose the natural numbers are "colored" with n different colors; each natural number gets one and only one of the n colors. Then there exists a color c and an infinite set D of natural numbers, all colored with c , such that every finite sum over D also has color c .  Hindman's theorem states that the class of IP sets is partition regular .  Semigroups  The definition of being IP has been extended from subsets of the special semigroup of natural numbers with addition to subsets of semigroups and partial semigroups in general.
