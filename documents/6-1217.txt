Hippopede

(Figure)
Hippopede (red) given as the pedal curve of an ellipse (black). The equation of the hippopede is 4x2+y2=(x2+y2)2.

In geometry, a hippopede (from Ancient Greek ἱπποπέδη, "horse fetter") is a plane curve determined by an equation of the form


 
 , where it is assumed that c>0 and c>d since the remaining cases either reduce to a single point or can be put into the given form with a rotation. Hippopedes are bicircular rational algebraic curves of degree 4 and symmetric with respect to both the x and y axes.
Special cases
When d>0 the curve has an oval form and is often known as an oval of Booth, and when d r^2 = 4 b (a- b \sin^{2} \theta)\, 
or in Cartesian coordinates


 
 .
Note that when a>b the torus intersects itself, so it does not resemble the usual picture of a torus.
