   Hippopede      Hippopede   (Figure)  Hippopede (red) given as the pedal curve of an ellipse (black). The equation of the hippopede is 4 x 2 +y 2 =( x 2 +y 2 ) 2 .   In geometry , a hippopede (from Ancient Greek ἱπποπέδη, "horse fetter") is a plane curve determined by an equation of the form        (    x  2   +   y  2    )   2   =    c   x  2    +   d   y  2          superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    2       c   superscript  x  2      d   superscript  y  2       (x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}=cx^{2}+dy^{2}   , where it is assumed that c >0 and c > d since the remaining cases either reduce to a single point or can be put into the given form with a rotation. Hippopedes are bicircular  rational algebraic curves of degree 4 and symmetric with respect to both the x and y axes.  Special cases  When d >0 the curve has an oval form and is often known as an oval of Booth , and when d r^2 = 4 b (a- b \sin^{2} \theta)\,  or in Cartesian coordinates         (    x  2   +   y  2    )   2   +   4  b   (   b  -  a   )    (    x  2   +   y  2    )     =   4   b  2    x  2           superscript     superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2    2     4  b    b  a      superscript  x  2    superscript  y  2        4   superscript  b  2    superscript  x  2      (x^{2}+y^{2})^{2}+4b(b-a)(x^{2}+y^{2})=4b^{2}x^{2}   .  Note that when a > b the torus intersects itself, so it does not resemble the usual picture of a torus.  See also   List of curves   References   Lawrence JD.
