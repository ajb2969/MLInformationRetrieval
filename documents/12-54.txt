   Fugacity capacity      Fugacity capacity   The fugacity capacity constant (Z) is used to help describe the concentration of a chemical in a system (usually in mol/m 3 Pa). Hemond and Hechner-Levy (2000) describe how to utilize the fugacity capacity to calculate the concentration of a chemical in a system. Depending on the chemical, fugacity capacity varies. The concentration in media 'm' equals the fugacity capacity in media 'm' multiplied by the fugacity of the chemical. 1 For a chemical system at equilibrium, the fugacity of the chemical will be the same in each media/phase/compartment. Therefore equilibrium is sometimes called "equifugacity" in the context of these calculations. 2  $$C_m = Z_m \cdot f$$  where Z is a proporational constant, termed fugacity capacity . This equation does not necessarily imply that C and f are always linearly related. Non-linearity can be accommodated by allowing Z to vary as a function of C or f.  For a better understanding of the fugacity capacity concept, heat capacity may provide a precedent for introducing Z as a capacity of a phase to absorb particular quantity of chemical. However, phases with high fugacity capacity do not necessarily retain high fugacity .  In calculations of fugacity capacity key factors would be (a) the nature of the solute (chemical), (b) the nature of the medium or compartment, (c) temperature. 3  Expressions for Fugacity Capacity  The expression for Z m is dependent on the media/phase/compartment. The following list gives the fugacity capacities for common medias: 4   Air (under ideal gas assumptions): Z air = 1/RT  Water: Z water = 1/H  Octanol: Z oct = K ow /H  Pure Phase of Target Chemical: Z pure = 1/P s v   Where: R is the Ideal gas constant (8.314 Pa*m 3 /mol*K); T is the absolute temperature (K); H is the Henry's law constant for the target chemical (Pa/m 3 mol); K ow is the octanol-water partition coefficient for the target chemical (dimensionless ratio); P s is the vapor pressure of the target chemical (Pa); and v is the molar volume of the target chemical (m 3 /mol).  Notice that the ratio between Z-values for different media (e.g. octanol and water) is the same as the ratio between the concentrations of the target chemical in each media at equilibrium.  When using a fugacity capacity approach to calculate the concentrations of a chemical in each of several medias/phases/compartments, it is often convenient to calculate the prevailing fugacity of the system using the following equation if the total mass of target chemical (M T ) and the volume of each compartment (V m ) are known:  $$f = M_T / \Sigma_m (V_m Z_m)$$  Alternatively, if the target chemical is present as a pure phase at equilibrium, its vapor pressure will be the prevailing fugacity of the system.
