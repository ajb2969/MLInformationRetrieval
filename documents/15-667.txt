QUICK scheme

In computational fluid dynamics QUICK, which stands for Quadratic Upstream Interpolation for Convective Kinematics, is a higher-order differencing scheme that considers a three point upstream weighted quadratic interpolation for the cell phase values. In computational fluid dynamics there are many solution methods for solving the steady convection–diffusion equation. Some of the used methods are the central differencing scheme, upwind scheme, hybrid scheme, power law scheme and QUICK scheme.
The QUICK scheme was presented by Brian P. Leonard – together with the QUICKEST (QUICK with Estimated Streaming Terms) scheme – in a 1979 paper.1
In order to find the cell face value a quadratic function passing through two bracketing or surrounding nodes and one node on the upstream side must be used. In central differencing scheme and second order upwind scheme the first order derivative is included and the second order derivative is ignored. These schemes are therefore considered second order accurate where as QUICK does take the second order derivative into account, but ignores the third order derivative hence this is considered third order accurate.2 This scheme is used to solve convection–diffusion equations using second order central difference for the diffusion term and for the convection term the scheme is third order accurate in space and first order accurate in time. QUICK is most appropriate for steady flow or quasi-steady highly convective elliptic flow.3
Quadratic interpolation for QUICK scheme

Quadratic profile

For the one-dimensional domain shown in the figure the Φ value at a control volume face is approximated using three-point quadratic function passing through the two bracketing or surrounding nodes and one other node on upstream side.4 In the figure, in order to calculate the value of the property at the face, we should have three nodes i.e. two bracketing or surrounding nodes and one upstream node.

Φw when uw > 0 and ue > 0 a quadratic fit through WW, W and P is used,
Φe when uw > 0 and ue > 0 a quadratic fit through W, P and E is used,
Φw when uw e < 0 values of W, P and E are used,
Φe when uw e < 0 values of P, E and EE are used.

Let the two bracketing nodes be i and i − 1 and upstream node i – 2 then for a uniform grid the value of φ at the cell face between the three nodes is given by:

Φface = 
 
 
 
  Φi-1 + 
 
 
 
  Φi − 
 
 
 
  Φi-2.
 

Interpretation of the property when the flow is in different directions
The steady convection and diffusion of a property ‘Ƥ’in a given one-dimensional flow field with velocity ῾ u` and in the absence of sources is given



For the continuity of the flow it must also satisfy



Discretizing the above equation to a control volume around a particular node we get



Integrating this continuity equation over the control volume we get
(ρuA)e - (ρuA)w = 0
now assuming F = ρu and D = r/δx
The corresponding cell face values of the above variables are given by
Fw = (ρu)w
Fe = (ρu)e
Dw = rw /δxWP
De = re /δxPE
Assuming constant area over the entire control volume we get

FeΦe – FwΦw = De(ΦE – ΦP) – Dw (ΦP - ΦW)
 

Positive direction
When the flow is in positive direction the values of the velocities will be uw > 0 and ue > 0,
For “w (west face)” bracketing nodes are W and P, the upstream node is WW then,5

Φw = 6/8ΦW + 3/8ΦP − 1/8ΦWW


For “e (east face)” bracketing nodes are P and E, the upstream node is W then

Φe = 6/8ΦP + 3/8ΦE − 1/8ΦW


Gradient of parabola is used to evaluate diffusion terms.
If Fw > 0 and Fe > 0 and if we use above equations for the convective terms and central differencing for the diffusion terms, the discretized form of the one-dimensional convection–diffusion transport equation will be written as:

FeΦe – FwΦw = De(ΦE – ΦP) – Dw (ΦP - ΦW)
 


Fe(6/8Φp + 3/8ΦE – 1/8Φw) – FW(6/8Φw + 3/8Φp – 1/8Φww) = De(ΦE – ΦP) – DW(Φp – Φw).
 

On re-arranging we get

[Dw – 3/8Fw + De + 6/8Fe] ΦP = [Dw + 6/8Fw + 1/8Fe] ΦW + [De – 3/8Fe] ΦE – 1/8FwΦWW,
 

now it can be written in the standard form:

aPΦP = aWΦW + aEΦE + aWWΦWW.
 

where:




aW

aE

aWW

aP





Dw + 6/8Fw + 1/8Fe

De - 3/8Fe

- 1/8Fw

aw + aE + aWW + (Fe - Fw)



Negative direction
When the flow is in negative direction the value of the velocities will be uw e w e w = 6/8ΦP + 3/8ΦW - 1/8ΦE

Φe = 6/8ΦE + 3/8ΦP - 1/8ΦEE


Substitution of these two formulae for the convective terms in the discretized convection-diffusion equation together with central differencing for the diffusion terms leads, after re-arrangement similar to positive direction as above, to the following coefficients.

aP





Dw + 3/8Fw

aw + aE + aEE + (Fe - Fw)



QUICK scheme for 1-D convection–diffusion problems

aPΦP = aWΦW + aEΦE + aWWΦWW + aEEΦEE


Here, aP = aW + aE + aWW + aEE + (Fe - Fw)

| -1/8 αwFw

De - 3/8αe Fe -6/8(1–αe)Fe -1/8 (1–αw)Fw

| 1/8(1 – αe)Fe



where

αw=1 for Fw > 0 and αe=1 for Fe > 0
 


αw=0 for Fw e=0 for Fe < 0.
 

Comparing the solutions of QUICK and upwind schemes
From the below graph we can say that QUICK scheme solution is much more accurate than the upwind scheme because the solution of the QUICK scheme matches the exact solution with lot more accuracy than the upwind scheme. In this scheme we face the problems of undershoot and overshoot due to which some minor errors occur. so these overshoots and undershoots are to be considered while interpreting solutions. False diffusion errors will also get minimized when compared with other schemes.
