   Dickman function      Dickman function   In analytic number theory , the Dickman function or Dickman–de Bruijn function ρ is a special function used to estimate the proportion of smooth numbers up to a given bound. It was first studied by actuary Karl Dickman , who defined it in his only mathematical publication, 1 and later studied by the Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn . 2 3  Definition  The Dickman-de Bruijn function    ρ   (  u  )       ρ  u    \rho(u)   is a continuous function that satisfies the delay differential equation        u   ρ  ′    (  u  )    +   ρ   (   u  -  1   )     =   0           u   superscript  ρ  normal-′   u     ρ    u  1     0    u\rho^{\prime}(u)+\rho(u-1)=0\,     with initial conditions     ρ   (  u  )    =  1        ρ  u   1    \rho(u)=1   for 0 ≤ u ≤ 1. Dickman proved that, when   a   a   a   is fixed, we have       Ψ   (  x  ,   x   1  /  a    )    ∼   x  ρ   (  a  )       similar-to    normal-Ψ   x   superscript  x    1  a        x  ρ  a     \Psi(x,x^{1/a})\sim x\rho(a)\,   where    Ψ   (  x  ,  y  )       normal-Ψ   x  y     \Psi(x,y)   is the number of y - smooth (or y - friable ) integers below x .  Ramaswami later gave a rigorous proof that for fixed a ,    Ψ   (  x  ,   x   1  /  a    )       normal-Ψ   x   superscript  x    1  a       \Psi(x,x^{1/a})   was asymptotic to    x  ρ   (  a  )       x  ρ  a    x\rho(a)   , with the error bound       Ψ   (  x  ,   x   1  /  a    )    =    x  ρ   (  a  )    +   O   (   x  /   log  x    )           normal-Ψ   x   superscript  x    1  a          x  ρ  a     O    x    x        \Psi(x,x^{1/a})=x\rho(a)+O(x/\log x)     in big O notation . 4  Applications  The main purpose of the Dickman–de Bruijn function is to estimate the frequency of smooth numbers at a given size. This can be used to optimize various number-theoretical algorithms, and can be useful of its own right.  It can be shown using    log  ρ      ρ    \log\rho   that 5       Ψ   (  x  ,  y  )    =   x   u   O   (   -  u   )            normal-Ψ   x  y      x   superscript  u    O    u        \Psi(x,y)=xu^{O(-u)}     which is related to the estimate     ρ   (  u  )    ≈   u   -  u          ρ  u    superscript  u    u      \rho(u)\approx u^{-u}   below.  The Golomb–Dickman constant has an alternate definition in terms of the Dickman–de Bruijn function.  Estimation  A first approximation might be      ρ   (  u  )    ≈   u   -  u     .        ρ  u    superscript  u    u      \rho(u)\approx u^{-u}.\,   A better estimate is 6       ρ   (  u  )    ∼    1   ξ    2  π  u      ⋅   exp   (    -   u  ξ    +   Ei   (  ξ  )     )        similar-to    ρ  u    normal-⋅    1    ξ      2  π  u              u  ξ     Ei  ξ        \rho(u)\sim\frac{1}{\xi\sqrt{2\pi u}}\cdot\exp(-u\xi+\operatorname{Ei}(\xi))     where Ei is the exponential integral and ξ is the positive root of         e  ξ   -  1   =   u  ξ    .         superscript  e  ξ   1     u  ξ     e^{\xi}-1=u\xi.\,     A simple upper bound is      ρ   (  x  )    ≤   1  /   x  !     .        ρ  x     1    x      \rho(x)\leq 1/x!.            u   u   u          ρ   (  u  )       ρ  u    \rho(u)          1   1     2   3.0685282     ×    10  -   1       absent     superscript  10    1     \times 10^{-}1        3   4.8608388     ×    10  -   2       absent     superscript  10    2     \times 10^{-}2        4   4.9109256     ×    10  -   3       absent     superscript  10    3     \times 10^{-}3        5   3.5472470     ×    10  -   4       absent     superscript  10    4     \times 10^{-}4        6   1.9649696     ×    10  -   5       absent     superscript  10    5     \times 10^{-}5        7   8.7456700     ×    10  -   7       absent     superscript  10    7     \times 10^{-}7        8   3.2320693     ×    10  -   8       absent     superscript  10    8     \times 10^{-}8        9   1.0162483     ×    10  -   9       absent     superscript  10    9     \times 10^{-}9        10   2.7701718     ×    10  -   11       absent     superscript  10    11     \times 10^{-}11        Computation  For each interval [ n − 1, n ] with n an integer, there is an analytic function     ρ  n     subscript  ρ  n    \rho_{n}   such that      ρ  n    (  u  )    =   ρ   (  u  )           subscript  ρ  n   u     ρ  u     \rho_{n}(u)=\rho(u)   . For 0 ≤ u ≤ 1,     ρ   (  u  )    =  1        ρ  u   1    \rho(u)=1   . For 1 ≤ u ≤ 2,     ρ   (  u  )    =   1  -   log  u          ρ  u     1    u      \rho(u)=1-\log u   . For 2 ≤ u ≤ 3,       ρ   (  u  )    =    1  -    (   1  -   log   (   u  -  1   )     )    log   (  u  )      +    Li  2    (   1  -  u   )    +    π  2   12          ρ  u       1      1      u  1       u       subscript  Li  2     1  u       superscript  π  2   12      \rho(u)=1-(1-\log(u-1))\log(u)+\operatorname{Li}_{2}(1-u)+\frac{\pi^{2}}{12}   .  with Li 2 the dilogarithm . Other    ρ  n     subscript  ρ  n    \rho_{n}   can be calculated using infinite series. 7  An alternate method is computing lower and upper bounds with the trapezoidal rule ; 8 a mesh of progressively finer sizes allows for arbitrary accuracy. For high precision calculations (hundreds of digits), a recursive series expansion about the midpoints of the intervals is superior. 9  Extension  Friedlander defines a two-dimensional analog    σ   (  u  ,  v  )       σ   u  v     \sigma(u,v)   of    ρ   (  u  )       ρ  u    \rho(u)   . 10 This function is used to estimate a function    Ψ   (  x  ,  y  ,  z  )       normal-Ψ   x  y  z     \Psi(x,y,z)   similar to de Bruijn's, but counting the number of y -smooth integers with at most one prime factor greater than z .
