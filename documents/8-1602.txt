Dickman function

 In analytic number theory, the Dickman function or Dickman–de Bruijn function ρ is a special function used to estimate the proportion of smooth numbers up to a given bound. It was first studied by actuary Karl Dickman, who defined it in his only mathematical publication,1 and later studied by the Dutch mathematician Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn.23
Definition
The Dickman-de Bruijn function 
 
 
 
  is a continuous function that satisfies the delay differential equation



with initial conditions 
 
 
 
  for 0 ≤ u ≤ 1. Dickman proved that, when 
 
 
 
  is fixed, we have


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the number of y-smooth (or y-friable) integers below x.
Ramaswami later gave a rigorous proof that for fixed a, 
 
 
 
  was asymptotic to 
 
 
 
 , with the error bound



in big O notation.4
Applications
The main purpose of the Dickman–de Bruijn function is to estimate the frequency of smooth numbers at a given size. This can be used to optimize various number-theoretical algorithms, and can be useful of its own right.
It can be shown using 
 
 
 
  that5



which is related to the estimate 
 
 
 
  below.
The Golomb–Dickman constant has an alternate definition in terms of the Dickman–de Bruijn function.
Estimation

Computation
For each interval [n − 1, n] with n an integer, there is an analytic function

 
  such that 
 
 
 
 . For 0 ≤ u ≤ 1, 
 
 
 
 . For 1 ≤ u ≤ 2, 
 
 
 
 . For 2 ≤ u ≤ 3,


 
 .
with Li2 the dilogarithm. Other 
 
 
 
  can be calculated using infinite series.7
An alternate method is computing lower and upper bounds with the trapezoidal rule;8 a mesh of progressively finer sizes allows for arbitrary accuracy. For high precision calculations (hundreds of digits), a recursive series expansion about the midpoints of the intervals is superior.9
Extension
Friedlander defines a two-dimensional analog 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 .10 This function is used to estimate a function 
 
 
 
  similar to de Bruijn's, but counting the number of y-smooth integers with at most one prime factor greater than z. Then
