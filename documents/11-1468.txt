Diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase




Diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase

In enzymology, a diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CDP-choline + 1,2-diacylglycerol 
 
 
 
  CMP + a phosphatidylcholine

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-choline and 1,2-diacylglycerol, whereas its two products are CMP and phosphatidylcholine.
Classification
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups.
Nomenclature
The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP choline:1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase. Other names in common use include: 

1-alkyl-2-acetyl-m-glycerol:CDPcholine choline phosphotransferase,
1-alkyl-2-acetyl-sn-glycerol cholinephosphotransferase,
1-alkyl-2-acetylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase,
alkylacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase,
alkylacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase,
CDP-choline diglyceride phosphotransferase,
cholinephosphotransferase,
CPT,
cytidine diphosphocholine glyceride transferase,
cytidine diphosphorylcholine diglyceride transferase,
diacylglycerol choline phosphotransferase,
phosphocholine diacylglyceroltransferase,
phosphorylcholine-glyceride transferase, and
sn-1,2-diacylglycerol cholinephosphotransferase.

Biological role
This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: aminophosphonate metabolism, glycerophospholipid metabolism, and ether lipid metabolism.
