   Nicotinate dehydrogenase      Nicotinate dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a nicotinate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction  (Figure)  Nicotinate dehydrogenase.svg    nicotinate + H 2 O + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-hydroxynicotinate + NADPH + H +   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are nicotinate , H 2 O , and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 6-hydroxynicotinate , NADPH , and H + .  Classification  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on CH or CH 2 groups with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor.  Nomenclature  The systematic name of this enzyme class is nicotinate:NADP + 6-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating) . Other names in common use include nicotinic acid hydroxylase , and nicotinate hydroxylase .  Biological role  This enzyme participates in nicotinate and nicotinamide metabolism . It has 2 cofactors : FAD , and Iron .
