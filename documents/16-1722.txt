Relative accessible surface area

Relative accessible surface area or relative accessibility of a protein residue is a measure of residue solvent exposure. It can be calculated by formula:



  

where 
 
 
 
  is the solvent accessible surface area and 
 
 
 
  is the maximum possible solvent accessible surface area for the residue in 
 
 
 
 .
Maximum possible solvent accessible surface area for each Amino acid can be taken from the table below
