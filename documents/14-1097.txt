   Specific-information      Specific-information   In information theory , specific-information is the generic name given to family of state-dependent measures that in expectation converge to the mutual information . There are currently three known varieties of specific information usually denoted    I  V     subscript  I  V    I_{V}   ,    I  S     subscript  I  S    I_{S}   , and    I   s  s  i      subscript  I    s  s  i     I_{ssi}   . The specific-information between a random variable   X   X   X   and a state    Y  =  y      Y  y    Y=y   is written as,      I   (  X  ;  Y  =  y  )      fragments  I   fragments  normal-(  X  normal-;  Y   y  normal-)     I(X;Y=y)   .
