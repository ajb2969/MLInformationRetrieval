   Acyclic space      Acyclic space   In mathematics , an acyclic space is a topological space  X in which cycles are always boundaries, in the sense of homology theory . This implies that integral homology groups in all dimensions of X are isomorphic to the corresponding homology groups of a point.  In other words, using the idea of reduced homology ,          H  ~   i    (  X  )    =  0   ,    ‚àÄ  i   ‚â•  0.      formulae-sequence       subscript   normal-~  H   i   X   0      for-all  i   0.     \tilde{H}_{i}(X)=0,\quad\forall i\geq 0.     If X is an acyclic CW complex , and if the fundamental group of X is trivial, then X is a contractible space , as follows from the Whitehead theorem and the Hurewicz theorem .  Examples  Acyclic spaces occur in topology , where they can be used to construct other, more interesting topological spaces.  For example, if one removes a single point from a manifold  M which is a homology sphere , one gets such a space. The homotopy groups of an acyclic space X do not vanish in general, because the fundamental group need not be trivial. For example, the punctured Poincar√© sphere is an acyclic, 3-dimensional manifold which is not contractible.  This gives a repertoire of examples, since the first homology group is the abelianisation of the fundamental group. With every perfect group  G one can associate a (canonical, terminal) acyclic space, whose fundamental group is a central extension of the given group G .  The homotopy groups of these associated acyclic spaces are closely related to Quillen 's plus construction on the classifying space  BG .  Acyclic groups  An acyclic group is a group G whose classifying space  BG is acyclic; in other words, all its (reduced) group homology groups vanish (       H  ~   i    (  G  ;  ùêô  )    =  0         subscript   normal-~  H   i    G  ùêô    0    \tilde{H}_{i}(G;\mathbf{Z})=0   ). Every acyclic group is thus a perfect group (meaning first homology group vanishes      H  1    (  G  ;  ùêô  )    =  0         subscript  H  1    G  ùêô    0    H_{1}(G;\mathbf{Z})=0   ), and in fact, a superperfect group (meaning first two homology groups vanish      H  1    (  G  ;  ùêô  )    =    H  2    (  G  ;  ùêô  )    =  0           subscript  H  1    G  ùêô       subscript  H  2    G  ùêô         0     H_{1}(G;\mathbf{Z})=H_{2}(G;\mathbf{Z})=0   ). The converse is not true: the binary icosahedral group is superperfect (hence perfect) but not acyclic.  References   Emmanuel Dror, "Acyclic spaces", Topology 11 (1972), 339‚Äì348.
