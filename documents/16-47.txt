(+)-endo-beta-bergamotene synthase ((2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing)




(+)-endo-beta-bergamotene synthase ((2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing)

(+)-endo-beta-bergamotene synthase ((2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate cyclizing) (, SBS) is an enzyme with system name (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate lyase (cyclizing; (+)-endo-beta-bergamotene-forming).1 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate 
 
 
 
  (+)-endo-beta-bergamotene + diphosphate


The enzyme synthesizes a mixture of sesquiterpenoids from (2Z,6Z)-farnesyl diphosphate.
