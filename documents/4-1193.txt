   Dini test      Dini test   In mathematics , the Dini and Dini-Lipschitz tests are highly precise tests that can be used to prove that the Fourier series of a function converges at a given point. These tests are named after Ulisse Dini and Rudolf Lipschitz . 1  Definition  Let f be a function on [0,2π], let t be some point and let δ be a positive number. We define the local modulus of continuity at the point t by        ω  f    (  δ  ;  t  )    =    max    |  ε  |   ≤  δ     |    f   (  t  )    -   f   (   t  +  ε   )     |           subscript  ω  f    δ  t      subscript       ε   δ          f  t     f    t  ε         \left.\right.\omega_{f}(\delta;t)=\max_{|\varepsilon|\leq\delta}|f(t)-f(t+%
 \varepsilon)|     Notice that we consider here f to be a periodic function, e.g. if t = 0 and ε is negative then we define  f (ε) = f (2π + ε).  The global modulus of continuity (or simply the modulus of continuity ) is defined by        ω  f    (  δ  )    =     max  t    ω  f     (  δ  ;  t  )           subscript  ω  f   δ       subscript   t    subscript  ω  f     δ  t      \left.\right.\omega_{f}(\delta)=\max_{t}\omega_{f}(\delta;t)     With these definitions we may state the main results  Theorem (Dini's test): Assume a function f satisfies at a point t that         ∫  0  π     1  δ    ω  f    (  δ  ;  t  )   d  δ    <  ∞   .        superscript   subscript   0   π       1  δ    subscript  ω  f    δ  t   d  δ       \int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{1}{\delta}\omega_{f}(\delta;t)\,d\delta<\infty.     Then the Fourier series of f converges at t to f(t).  For example, the theorem holds with     ω  f   =    log   -  2     (   δ   -  1    )         subscript  ω  f     superscript     2     superscript  δ    1       \omega_{f}=\log^{-2}(\delta^{-1})   but does not hold with     log   -  1     (   δ   -  1    )       superscript     1     superscript  δ    1      \log^{-1}(\delta^{-1})   .  Theorem (the Dini-Lipschitz test): Assume a function f satisfies         ω  f    (  δ  )    =   o    (   log   1  δ    )    -  1      .         subscript  ω  f   δ     o   superscript      1  δ      1       \omega_{f}(\delta)=o\left(\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)^{-1}.     Then the Fourier series of f converges uniformly to f.  In particular, any function of a Hölder class satisfies the Dini-Lipschitz test.  Precision  Both tests are best of their kind. For the Dini-Lipschitz test, it is possible to construct a function f with its modulus of continuity satisfying the test with O instead of o , i.e.         ω  f    (  δ  )    =   O    (   log   1  δ    )    -  1      .         subscript  ω  f   δ     O   superscript      1  δ      1       \omega_{f}(\delta)=O\left(\log\frac{1}{\delta}\right)^{-1}.     and the Fourier series of f diverges. For the Dini test, the statement of precision is slightly longer: it says that for any function Ω such that        ∫  0  π     1  δ   Ω   (  δ  )   d  δ    =  ∞        superscript   subscript   0   π       1  δ   normal-Ω  δ  d  δ       \int_{0}^{\pi}\frac{1}{\delta}\Omega(\delta)\,d\delta=\infty     there exists a function f such that        ω  f    (  δ  ;  0  )    <   Ω   (  δ  )           subscript  ω  f    δ  0      normal-Ω  δ     \left.\right.\omega_{f}(\delta;0)<\Omega(\delta)     and the Fourier series of f diverges at 0.
