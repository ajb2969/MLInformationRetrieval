   Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture      Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture   The Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture concerns the integer solutions of equations which contain sums of like powers. The equations are generalisations of those considered in Fermat's Last Theorem .  Background  Diophantine equations , such as the integer version of the equation a 2 + b 2 = c 2 that appears in the Pythagorean theorem , have been studied for their integer  solution properties for centuries. Fermat's Last Theorem states that for powers greater than 2, the equation a k + b k = c k has no solutions with three positive  integers  a , b , c . Extending the number of terms on either or both sides, and allowing for higher powers than 2, led to Leonhard Euler to propose in 1769 that for all integers n and k greater than 1, if the sum of n  k th powers of positive integers is itself a k th power, then n is greater than or equal to k .  In symbols, if      ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i  k    =   b  k         superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  a  i   k     superscript  b  k     \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{k}=b^{k}   where n > 1 and     a  1   ,   a  2   ,  …  ,   a  n   ,  b      subscript  a  1    subscript  a  2   normal-…   subscript  a  n   b    a_{1},a_{2},\dots,a_{n},b   are positive integers, then his conjecture was that n ≥ k .  In 1966 , a counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture was found by L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin for k = 5: 1    27 5 + 84 5 + 110 5 + 133 5 = 144 5 .     In subsequent years further counterexamples were found, including for k = 4. The latter disproved the more specific Euler quartic conjecture , namely that a 4 + b 4 + c 4 = d 4 , has no positive integer solutions. In fact, the smallest solution, found in 1988, is    414560 4 + 217519 4 + 95800 4 = 422481 4 .     Conjecture  In 1967, L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin, and John Selfridge conjectured 2 that if      ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i  k    =    ∑   j  =  1   m    b  j  k          superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  a  i   k      superscript   subscript     j  1    m    superscript   subscript  b  j   k      \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{k}=\sum_{j=1}^{m}b_{j}^{k}   , where a i ≠ b j are positive integers for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m , then m + n ≥ k . The equal sum of like powers formula is often abbreviated as ( k , m , n ).  This implies in the special case of m = 1 that if          ∑   i  =  1   n    a  i  k    =   b  k         superscript   subscript     i  1    n    superscript   subscript  a  i   k     superscript  b  k     \sum_{i=1}^{n}a_{i}^{k}=b^{k}        (under the conditions given above) then n ≥ k −1.  For this special case, known solutions satisfying the proposed constraint with '' n'' either less than or equal to k , where terms are positive integers , hence giving a partition of a power into like powers, are:  === k = 4===    95800 4 + 217519 4 + 414560 4 = 422481 4 , (Roger Frye, 1988)       30 4 + 120 4 + 272 4 + 315 4 = 353 4 , (R. Norrie, 1911)     === k = 5===    27 5 + 84 5 + 110 5 + 133 5 = 144 5 , (Lander, Parkin, 1966)       7 5 + 43 5 + 57 5 + 80 5 + 100 5 = 107 5 , (Sastry, 1934, third smallest)     === k = 6===    (None known.)     === k = 7===    127 7 + 258 7 + 266 7 + 413 7 + 430 7 + 439 7 + 525 7 = 568 7 , (M. Dodrill, 1999)     === k = 8===    90 8 + 223 8 + 478 8 + 524 8 + 748 8 + 1088 8 + 1190 8 + 1324 8 = 1409 8 , (Scott Chase, 2000)     === k >= 9===    (None known.)     Current Status  It is not known if the conjecture is true, or if solutions exist that would be counterexamples, such as a k + b k = c k + d k for k ≥ 5.
