Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture

The Lander, Parkin, and Selfridge conjecture concerns the integer solutions of equations which contain sums of like powers. The equations are generalisations of those considered in Fermat's Last Theorem.
Background
Diophantine equations, such as the integer version of the equation a2 + b2 = c2 that appears in the Pythagorean theorem, have been studied for their integer solution properties for centuries. Fermat's Last Theorem states that for powers greater than 2, the equation ak + bk = ck has no solutions with three positive integers a, b, c. Extending the number of terms on either or both sides, and allowing for higher powers than 2, led to Leonhard Euler to propose in 1769 that for all integers n and k greater than 1, if the sum of n kth powers of positive integers is itself a kth power, then n is greater than or equal to k.
In symbols, if 
 
 
 
  where n > 1 and 
 
 
 
  are positive integers, then his conjecture was that n ≥ k.
In 1966, a counterexample to Euler's sum of powers conjecture was found by L. J. Lander and T. R. Parkin for k = 5:1


275 + 845 + 1105 + 1335 = 1445.
 



In subsequent years further counterexamples were found, including for k = 4. The latter disproved the more specific Euler quartic conjecture, namely that a4 + b4 + c4 = d4, has no positive integer solutions. In fact, the smallest solution, found in 1988, is


4145604 + 2175194 + 958004 = 4224814.
 



Conjecture
In 1967, L. J. Lander, T. R. Parkin, and John Selfridge conjectured2 that if 
 
 
 
 , where ai ≠ bj are positive integers for all 1 ≤ i ≤ n and 1 ≤ j ≤ m, then m+n ≥ k. The equal sum of like powers formula is often abbreviated as (k, m, n).
This implies in the special case of m = 1 that if








(under the conditions given above) then n ≥ k−1.
For this special case, known solutions satisfying the proposed constraint with '' n'' either less than or equal to k, where terms are positive integers, hence giving a partition of a power into like powers, are:
===k = 4===


958004 + 2175194 + 4145604 = 4224814, (Roger Frye, 1988)
 





304 + 1204 + 2724 + 3154 = 3534, (R. Norrie, 1911)
 



===k = 5===


275 + 845 + 1105 + 1335 = 1445, (Lander, Parkin, 1966)
 





75 + 435 + 575 + 805 + 1005 = 1075, (Sastry, 1934, third smallest)
 



===k = 6===


(None known.)
 



===k = 7===


1277 + 2587 + 2667 + 4137 + 4307 + 4397 + 5257 = 5687, (M. Dodrill, 1999)
 



===k = 8===


908 + 2238 + 4788 + 5248 + 7488 + 10888 + 11908 + 13248 = 14098, (Scott Chase, 2000)
 



===k >= 9===


(None known.)
 



Current Status
It is not known if the conjecture is true, or if solutions exist that would be counterexamples, such as ak + bk = ck + dk for k ≥ 5.
