Extended negative binomial distribution

In probability and statistics the extended negative binomial distribution is a discrete probability distribution extending the negative binomial distribution. It is a truncated version of the negative binomial distribution1 for which estimation methods have been studied.2
In the context of actuarial science, the distribution appeared in its general form in a paper by K. Hess, A. Liewald and K.D. Schmidt3 when they characterized all distributions for which the extended Panjer recursion works. For the case 
 
 
 
 , the distribution was already discussed by Willmot4 and put into a parametrized family with the logarithmic distribution and the negative binomial distribution by H.U. Gerber.5

Probability generating function

For the important case

$( –1, 0 )$, this simplifies to
$$\varphi(s)=\frac{1-(1-ps)^{-r}}{1-(1-p)^{-r}}
 \qquad\text{for }|s|\le\frac1p.$$
