   Quantum rotor model      Quantum rotor model   The quantum rotor model is a mathematical model for a quantum system. It can be visualized as an array of rotating electrons which behave as rigid rotors that interact through short-range dipole-dipole magnetic forces originating from their magnetic dipole moments (neglecting Coulomb forces ). The model differs from similar spin-models such as the Ising model and the Heisenberg model in that it includes a term analogous to kinetic energy .  Although elementary quantum rotors do not exist in nature, the model can describe effective degrees of freedom for a system of sufficiently small number of closely coupled electrons in low-energy states. 1  Suppose the n-dimensional position (orientation) vector of the model at a given site   i   i   i   is   𝐧   𝐧   \mathbf{n}   . Then, we can define rotor momentum   𝐩   𝐩   \mathbf{p}   by the commutation relation of components    α  ,  β     α  β    \alpha,\beta        [   n  α   ,   p  β   ]   =   i   δ   α  β           subscript  n  α    subscript  p  β      i   subscript  δ    α  β       [n_{\alpha},p_{\beta}]=i\delta_{\alpha\beta}     However, it is found convenient 2 to use rotor angular momentum operators   𝐋   𝐋   \mathbf{L}   defined (in 3 dimensions) by components     L  α   =    ε   α  β  γ     n  β    p  γ         subscript  L  α      subscript  ε    α  β  γ     subscript  n  β    subscript  p  γ      L_{\alpha}=\varepsilon_{\alpha\beta\gamma}n_{\beta}p_{\gamma}     Then, the magnetic interactions between the quantum rotors, and thus their energy states, can be described by the following Hamiltonian :       H  R   =      J   g  ¯    2     ∑  i    𝐋  i  2     -   J    ∑   ⟨   i  j   ⟩      𝐧  i   ⋅   𝐧  j            subscript  H  R           J   normal-¯  g    2     subscript   i    superscript   subscript  𝐋  i   2       J    subscript    delimited-⟨⟩    i  j      normal-⋅   subscript  𝐧  i    subscript  𝐧  j         H_{R}=\frac{J\bar{g}}{2}\sum_{i}\mathbf{L}_{i}^{2}-J\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}%
 \mathbf{n}_{i}\cdot\mathbf{n}_{j}     where    J  ,   g  ¯      J   normal-¯  g     J,\bar{g}   are constants.. The interaction sum is taken over nearest neighbors, as indicated by the angle brackets. For very small and very large    g  ¯     normal-¯  g    \bar{g}   , the Hamiltonian predicts two distinct configurations ( ground states ), namely "magnetically" ordered rotors and disordered or " paramagnetic " rotors, respectively. 3  The interactions between the quantum rotors can be described by another (equivalent) Hamiltonian, which treats the rotors not as magnetic moments but as local electric currents. 4  Properties  One of the important features of the rotor model is the continuous O(N) symmetry, and hence the corresponding continuous symmetry breaking in the magnetically ordered state. In a system with two layers of Heisenberg spins     𝐒   1  i      subscript  𝐒    1  i     \mathbf{S}_{1i}   and    𝐒   2  i      subscript  𝐒    2  i     \mathbf{S}_{2i}   , the rotor model approximates the low-energy states of a Heisenberg antiferromagnet, with the Hamiltonian       H  d   =    K    ∑  i     𝐒   1  i    ⋅   𝐒   2  i       +   J    ∑   ⟨   i  j   ⟩     (     𝐒   1  i    ⋅   𝐒   1  j     +    𝐒   2  i    ⋅   𝐒   2  j      )           subscript  H  d       K    subscript   i    normal-⋅   subscript  𝐒    1  i     subscript  𝐒    2  i         J    subscript    delimited-⟨⟩    i  j        normal-⋅   subscript  𝐒    1  i     subscript  𝐒    1  j      normal-⋅   subscript  𝐒    2  i     subscript  𝐒    2  j           H_{d}=K\sum_{i}\mathbf{S}_{1i}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{2i}+J\sum_{\langle ij\rangle}%
 \left(\mathbf{S}_{1i}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{1j}+\mathbf{S}_{2i}\cdot\mathbf{S}_{2j}\right)     using the correspondence     𝐋  i   =    𝐒   1  i    +   𝐒   2  i          subscript  𝐋  i      subscript  𝐒    1  i     subscript  𝐒    2  i       \mathbf{L}_{i}=\mathbf{S}_{1i}+\mathbf{S}_{2i}    5  The particular case of quantum rotor model which has the O(2) symmetry can be used to describe a superconducting array of Josephson junctions or the behavior of bosons in optical lattices . 6 Another specific case of O(3) symmetry is equivalent to a system of two layers (bilayer) of a quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet ; it can also describe double-layer quantum Hall ferromagnets. 7 It can also be shown that the phase transition for the two dimensional rotor model has the same universality class as that of antiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin models. 8  See also   Heisenberg model (quantum)  Ising model   References  "  Category:Spin models     ↩    ↩    ↩  ↩
