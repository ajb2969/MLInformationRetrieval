Barwise compactness theorem

In mathematical logic, the Barwise compactness theorem, named after Jon Barwise, is a generalization of the usual compactness theorem for first-order logic to a certain class of infinitary languages. It was stated and proved by Barwise in 1967.
Statement of the theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a countable admissible set. Let 
 
 
 
  be an 
 
 
 
 -finite relational language. Suppose 
 
 
 
 
  is a set of 
 
 
 
 -sentences, where 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
  set with parameters from 
 
 
 
 , and every 
 
 
 
 
 -finite subset of 
 
 
 
  is satisfiable. Then 
 
 
 
  is satisfiable.
