   Barwise compactness theorem      Barwise compactness theorem   In mathematical logic , the Barwise compactness theorem , named after Jon Barwise , is a generalization of the usual compactness theorem for first-order logic to a certain class of infinitary languages. It was stated and proved by Barwise in 1967.  Statement of the theorem  Let   A   A   A   be a countable admissible set . Let   L   L   L   be an   A   A   A   -finite relational language. Suppose   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is a set of    L  A     subscript  L  A    L_{A}   -sentences, where   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is a    Σ  1     subscript  normal-Σ  1    \Sigma_{1}   set with parameters from   A   A   A   , and every   A   A   A   -finite subset of   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is satisfiable. Then   Γ   normal-Γ   \Gamma   is satisfiable.
