   Phenylpyruvate decarboxylase      Phenylpyruvate decarboxylase   In enzymology , a phenylpyruvate decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   phenylpyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   phenylacetaldehyde + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , phenylpyruvate , and two products , phenylacetaldehyde and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is phenylpyruvate carboxy-lyase (phenylacetaldehyde-forming) . This enzyme is also called phenylpyruvate carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in phenylalanine and tryptophan metabolism.  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
