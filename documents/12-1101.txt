Lambert summation

In mathematical analysis, Lambert summation is a summability method for a class of divergent series.
Definition
A series 
 
 
 
  is Lambert summable to A, written 
 
 
 
 , if



If a series is convergent to A then it is Lambert summable to A (an Abelian theorem).
Examples



 
 , where μ is the Möbius function. Hence if this series converges at all, it converges to zero.
