   Hexagonal number      Hexagonal number   A hexagonal number is a figurate number . The n th hexagonal number h n is the number of distinct dots in a pattern of dots consisting of the outlines of regular hexagons with sides up to n dots, when the hexagons are overlaid so that they share one vertex .  The formula for the n th hexagonal number        h  n   =    2   n  2    -  n   =   n   (    2  n   -  1   )    =     2  n   ×   (    2  n   -  1   )    2    .         subscript  h  n       2   superscript  n  2    n          n      2  n   1               2  n       2  n   1    2      h_{n}=2n^{2}-n=n(2n-1)={{2n}\times{(2n-1)}\over 2}.\,\!     The first few hexagonal numbers  are:   1 , 6 , 15 , 28 , 45 , 66 , 91 , 120 , 153 , 190 , 231, 276, 325, 378, 435, 496 , 561 , 630, 703, 780, 861, 946.   Every hexagonal number is a triangular number , but only every other triangular number (the 1st, 3rd, 5th, 7th, etc.) is a hexagonal number. Like a triangular number, the digital root in base 10 of a hexagonal number can only be 1, 3, 6, or 9. The digital root pattern, repeating every nine terms, is "1 6 6 1 9 3 1 3 9".  Every even perfect number is hexagonal, given by the formula        M  p    2   p  -  1     =     M  p    (    M  p   +  1   )    /  2   =   h    (    M  p   +  1   )   /  2    =   h   2   p  -  1              subscript  M  p    superscript  2    p  1          subscript  M  p      subscript  M  p   1    2         subscript  h       subscript  M  p   1   2          subscript  h   superscript  2    p  1        M_{p}2^{p-1}=M_{p}(M_{p}+1)/2=h_{(M_{p}+1)/2}=h_{2^{p-1}}      where M p is a Mersenne prime . No odd perfect numbers are known, hence all known perfect numbers are hexagonal.  For example, the 2nd hexagonal number is 2×3 = 6; the 4th is 4×7 = 28; the 16th is 16×31 = 496; and the 64th is 64×127 = 8128.   The largest number that cannot be written as a sum of at most four hexagonal numbers is 130 . Adrien-Marie Legendre proved in 1830 that any integer greater than 1791 can be expressed in this way.  Hexagonal numbers can be rearranged into rectangular numbers of size n by (2 n −1).  Hexagonal numbers should not be confused with centered hexagonal numbers , which model the standard packaging of Vienna sausages . To avoid ambiguity, hexagonal numbers are sometimes called "cornered hexagonal numbers".  Test for hexagonal numbers  One can efficiently test whether a positive integer x is an hexagonal number by computing       n  =       8  x   +  1    +  1   4    .      n            8  x   1    1   4     n=\frac{\sqrt{8x+1}+1}{4}.     If n is an integer, then x is the n th hexagonal number. If n is not an integer, then x is not hexagonal.  Other properties  The n th number of the hexagonal sequence can also be expressed by using Sigma notation as       h  n   =    ∑   i  =  0    n  -  1     (    4  i   +  1   )         subscript  h  n     superscript   subscript     i  0      n  1        4  i   1      h_{n}=\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}{(4i+1)}     where the empty sum is taken to be 0.
