   Tanaka's formula      Tanaka's formula   In the stochastic calculus , Tanaka's formula states that       |   B  t   |   =     ∫  0  t     sgn   (   B  s   )    d   B  s     +   L  t           subscript  B  t        superscript   subscript   0   t      sgn   subscript  B  s    d   subscript  B  s      subscript  L  t      |B_{t}|=\int_{0}^{t}\operatorname{sgn}(B_{s})\,dB_{s}+L_{t}     where B t is the standard Brownian motion , sgn denotes the sign function       sgn   (  x  )    =   {       +  1   ,       x  >  0   ;        0  ,      x  =  0         -  1   ,      x  <  0.            sgn  x    cases    1     x  0   0    x  0     1     x  0.      \operatorname{sgn}(x)=\begin{cases}+1,&x>0;\\

 \in(-\varepsilon,+\varepsilon)\}|.     Properties  Tanaka's formula is the explicit Doob–Meyer decomposition of the submartingale | B t | into the martingale part (the integral on the right-hand side), and a continuous increasing process (local time). It can also be seen as the analogue of Itō's lemma for the (nonsmooth) absolute value function     f   (  x  )    =   |  x  |         f  x     x     f(x)=|x|   , with      f  ′    (  x  )    =   sgn   (  x  )           superscript  f  normal-′   x    sgn  x     f^{\prime}(x)=\operatorname{sgn}(x)   and      f  ′′    (  x  )    =   2  δ   (  x  )           superscript  f  ′′   x     2  δ  x     f^{\prime\prime}(x)=2\delta(x)   ; see local time for a formal explanation of the Itō term.  Outline of proof  The function | x | is not C 2 in x at x = 0, so we cannot apply Itō's formula directly. But if we approximate it near zero (i.e. in [− ε , ε ]) by parabolas         x  2    2   |  ε  |     +    |  ε  |   2    .         superscript  x  2     2    ε         ε   2     \frac{x^{2}}{2|\varepsilon|}+\frac{|\varepsilon|}{2}.     And using Itō's formula we can then take the limit as ε → 0, leading to Tanaka's formula.
