Alternating permutation

In combinatorial mathematics, an alternating permutation of the set {1, 2, 3, ..., n} is an arrangement of those numbers into an order c1, ..., cn such that no element ci is between ci − 1 and ci + 1 for any value of i and c12. In other words, ci i+ 1 if i is odd and ci > ci+ 1 if i is even. For example, the five alternating permutations of {1, 2, 3, 4} are:
 
1, 3, 2, 4       because       1  2 < 4
1, 4, 2, 3       because       1  2 < 3
2, 3, 1, 4       because       2  1 < 4
2, 4, 1, 3       because       2  1 < 3
3, 4, 1, 2       because       3  1 < 2

This type of permutation was first studied by Désiré André in the 19th century.1
If the condition c1 2 is dropped, so we only require that no element ci is between ci − 1 and ci + 1, then the permutation is called a zigzag permutation. By exchanging 1 with n, 2 with n − 1, etc., each zigzag permutation with c1> c2 can be paired uniquely with an alternating permutation.

The determination of the number, An, of alternating permutations of the set {1, ..., n} is called André's problem. If Zn denotes the number of zigzag permutations of {1, ..., n} then it is clear from the pairing given above that Zn = 2An for n ≥ 2. The numbers An are known as Euler zigzag numbers or up/down numbers. The first few values of An are 1, 1, 1, 2, 5, 16, 61, 272, 1385, 7936, 50521, ... . The first few values of Zn are 1, 1, 2, 4, 10, 32, 122, 544, 2770, 15872, 101042, ... .
The Euler zigzag numbers are related to Entringer numbers, from which the zigzag numbers may be computed. The nth zigzag number is equal to the Entringer number E(n, n), and these Entringer numbers can be defined recursively as follows:2

The numbers A2n with even indices are called secant numbers or zig numbers. The first few values are 1, 1, 5, 61, 1385, 50521, ... . They appear as numerators in the Maclaurin series of sec x. Specifically,



Secant numbers are related to Euler numbers by the formula E2n = (−1)nA2n. (En = 0 when n is odd.)
Correspondingly, the numbers A2n+1 with odd indices are called tangent numbers or zag numbers. The first few values are 1, 2, 16, 272, 7936, ... . They appear as numerators in the Maclaurin series of tan x. Specifically,



Tangent numbers are related to Bernoulli numbers by the formula



for n > 0.
Adding these series together gives the exponential generating function of the sequence An:






André's theorem
In some contexts, one defines the terms alternating permutation and reverse-alternating permutation so that the former are arrangements of the set { 1, 2, 3, ..., n} into a sequence a1, ..., an satisfying



and the latter satisfy



(A bijection between alternating and reverse-alternating permutations is given by



Let En be the number of alternating permutations of the set { 1, 2, 3, ..., n}. The first several of these numbers are



André's theorem states:

The exponential generating function of the numbers En is
 









The radius of convergence of this series can be seen to be positive by noticing that En is bounded above by n!. In fact, the radius is 
 
 
 
 
 /2.
Proof
Here we prove André's theorem by means of a combinatorial argument showing that this generating function satisfies a certain differential equation, and we use the initial condition ƒ(0) = 1. This proof is due to  and also appears in . See also this preprint by Stanley.
The principal combinatorial result that we need is this identity:



The proviso that n ≥ 1 is crucial.
A proof of this combinatorial identity runs as follows. To choose an alternating or reverse-alternating permutation of the set { 1, 2, 3, ..., n, n + 1 }, we

choose a subset of size k of the set { 1, ..., n }, then
choose a reverse-alternating permutation a1, ..., ak of the set { 1, ..., k }, then
choose a reverse-alternating permutation b1, ..., bn−k of the set { k + 1, ..., n }.

Then the permutation



is either alternating or reverse-alternating. The number of ways to choose a permutation of { 1, 2, 3, ..., n, n + 1 } that is either alternating or reverse-alternating is En+1, and the number of ways to complete the sequence of steps above is



This needs to be done for each possible value of k to get a complete list, hence we sum from k = 0 to k = n. This completes the proof of the identity (1).
Multiplication of both sides of (1) by xn+1/(n+1)! and summing over n ≥ 1, and then prepending the constant and first-degree terms, yields



Differentiating both sides, we get



In the last sum, the index n goes from 1 to ∞, not from 0 to ∞. If we change the lower bound of summation from 1 to 0, we simply add 1 to the sum, and compensate by changing the initial term, 2E1 = 2, to E1 = 1, getting



The last sum is over all pairs of positive integers, so the expression above can be rearranged as



(see Cauchy product).
The expression 
 
 
 
  does not change as j goes from 0 to ∞; hence it can be pulled out of the inside sum, getting



Now the second sum does not change as i goes from 0 to ∞; hence it can be pulled out of the outer sum, getting



This is



Consequently we have a differential equation



This can be solved by separation of variables, getting



We have an initial condition ƒ(0) = 1, so we have



Finally, a standard tangent half-angle trigonometric identity gives us



This completes the proof of André's theorem.
