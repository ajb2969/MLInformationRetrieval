   Indexed language      Indexed language   Indexed languages are a class of formal languages discovered by Alfred Aho ; 1 they are described by indexed grammars and can be recognized by nested stack automata . 2  Indexed languages are a proper subset of context-sensitive languages . 3 They qualify as an abstract family of languages (furthermore a full AFL) and hence satisfy many closure properties. However, they are not closed under intersection or complement. 4  The class of indexed languages has  generalization of context-free languages , since indexed grammars can describe many of the nonlocal constraints occurring in natural languages.  Gerald Gazdar (1988) 5 and Vijay-Shanker (1987) 6 introduced a mildly context-sensitive language class now known as linear indexed grammars (LIG). 7 Linear indexed grammars have additional restrictions relative to IG. LIGs are weakly equivalent (generate the same language class) as tree adjoining grammars . 8  Examples  The following languages are indexed, but are not context-free :      {    a  n    b  n    c  n    d  n    |   n  ≥  1   }     conditional-set     superscript  a  n    superscript  b  n    superscript  c  n    superscript  d  n      n  1     \{a^{n}b^{n}c^{n}d^{n}|n\geq 1\}    9      {    a  n    b  m    c  n    d  m    |    m  ,  n   ≥  0   }     conditional-set     superscript  a  n    superscript  b  m    superscript  c  n    superscript  d  m       m  n   0     \{a^{n}b^{m}c^{n}d^{m}|m,n\geq 0\}    10  These two languages are also indexed, but are not even mildly context sensitive under Gazdar's characterization:      {   a   2  n    |   n  ≥  0   }     conditional-set   superscript  a   superscript  2  n      n  0     \{a^{2^{n}}|n\geq 0\}    11      {   w  w  w   |   w  ∈    {  a  ,  b  }   +    }     conditional-set    w  w  w     w   superscript   a  b        \{www|w\in\{a,b\}^{+}\}    12  On the other hand, the following language is not indexed: 13      {    (   a   b  n    )   n   |   n  ≥  0   }     conditional-set   superscript    a   superscript  b  n    n     n  0     \{(ab^{n})^{n}|n\geq 0\}     Properties  Hopcroft and Ullman tend to consider indexed languages as a "natural" class, since they are generated by several formalisms, such as: {{#tag:ref|Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation, 14 Bibliographic notes, p.394-395}}   Aho 's indexed grammars 15  Aho 's one-way nested stack automata 16  Fischer 's macro grammars 17  Greibach 's automata with stacks of stacks 18  Maibaum 's algebraic characterization 19   Hayashi 20 generalized the pumping lemma to indexed grammars. Conversely, Gilman 21 22 gives a "shrinking lemma" for indexed languages.
