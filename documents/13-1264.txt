   Tertiary ideal      Tertiary ideal   In mathematics , a tertiary ideal is an (two-sided) ideal in a (perhaps noncommutative) ring that cannot be expressed as a nontrivial intersection of a right fractional ideal with another ideal. Tertiary ideals generalize primary ideals to the case of noncommutative rings . Although primary decompositions do not exist in general for ideals in noncommutative rings, tertiary decompositions do, at least if the ring is Noetherian .  Every primary ideal is tertiary. Tertiary ideals and primary ideals coincide for commutative rings. To any (two-sided) ideal, a tertiary ideal can be associated called the tertiary radical, defined as        t   (  I  )    =   {   r  ∈   R     |       ∀  s    ∉  I   ,      ∃  x    ∈    (  s  )    x   ∉   I  and   (  x  )    (  r  )    ⊂  I    }    .        t  I    conditional-set    r    R      formulae-sequence        for-all  s    I            x      s   x          I  and  x  r        I        t(I)=\{r\in R\mbox{ }|\mbox{ }\forall s\notin I,\mbox{ }\exists x\in(s)\mbox{ %
 }x\notin I\text{ and }(x)(r)\subset I\}.\,     Then t ( I ) always contains I .  If R is a (not necessarily commutative) Noetherian ring and I a right ideal in R , then I has a unique irredundant decomposition into tertiary ideals      I  =    T  1   ∩  …  ∩   T  n        I     subscript  T  1   normal-…   subscript  T  n      I=T_{1}\cap\dots\cap T_{n}   .
