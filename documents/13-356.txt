   Nilradical of a Lie algebra      Nilradical of a Lie algebra   In algebra , the nilradical of a Lie algebra is a nilpotent ideal , which is as large as possible.  The nilradical    𝔫  𝔦  𝔩   (  𝔤  )       𝔫  𝔦  𝔩  𝔤    \mathfrak{nil}(\mathfrak{g})   of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is its maximal nilpotent ideal , which exists because the sum of any two nilpotent ideals is nilpotent. It is an ideal in the radical     𝔯  𝔞  𝔡   (  𝔤  )       𝔯  𝔞  𝔡  𝔤    \mathfrak{rad}(\mathfrak{g})   of the Lie algebra   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   . The quotient of a Lie algebra by its nilradical is a reductive Lie algebra    𝔤  red     superscript  𝔤  red    \mathfrak{g}^{\mathrm{red}}   . However, the corresponding short exact sequence      0  →   𝔫  𝔦  𝔩   (  𝔤  )    →  𝔤  →   𝔤  red   →  0       normal-→  0    𝔫  𝔦  𝔩  𝔤     normal-→    𝔤    normal-→     superscript  𝔤  red     normal-→    0     0\to\mathfrak{nil}(\mathfrak{g})\to\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}^{\mathrm{red}}\to
 0   does not split in general (i.e., there isn't always a subalgebra complementary to    𝔫  𝔦  𝔩   (  𝔤  )       𝔫  𝔦  𝔩  𝔤    \mathfrak{nil}(\mathfrak{g})   in   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   ). This is in contrast to the Levi decomposition : the short exact sequence      0  →   𝔯  𝔞  𝔡   (  𝔤  )    →  𝔤  →   𝔤  ss   →  0       normal-→  0    𝔯  𝔞  𝔡  𝔤     normal-→    𝔤    normal-→     superscript  𝔤  ss     normal-→    0     0\to\mathfrak{rad}(\mathfrak{g})\to\mathfrak{g}\to\mathfrak{g}^{\mathrm{ss}}\to
 0   does split (essentially because the quotient    𝔤  ss     superscript  𝔤  ss    \mathfrak{g}^{\mathrm{ss}}   is semisimple).  See also   Levi decomposition  Nilradical of a ring , a notion in ring theory.   References     .   "  Category:Lie algebras
