Nilradical of a Lie algebra

In algebra, the nilradical of a Lie algebra is a nilpotent ideal, which is as large as possible.
The nilradical 
 
 
 
  of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  is its maximal nilpotent ideal, which exists because the sum of any two nilpotent ideals is nilpotent. It is an ideal in the radical

 
  of the Lie algebra 
 
 
 
 
 . The quotient of a Lie algebra by its nilradical is a reductive Lie algebra 
 
 
 
 . However, the corresponding short exact sequence


 
  does not split in general (i.e., there isn't always a subalgebra complementary to 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 ). This is in contrast to the Levi decomposition: the short exact sequence


 
  does split (essentially because the quotient 
 
 
 
  is semisimple).
