Allophanate hydrolase

In enzymology, an allophanate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

allophanate + 3 H2O + H+

 
  2 HCO3− + 2 NH4+


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are allophanate (urea-1-carboxylate or N-carbamoylcarbamate) and H2O, whereas its two products are HCO3− and NH4+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is urea-1-carboxylate amidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called allophanate lyase. This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups and atrazine degradation.
