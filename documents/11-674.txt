   Allophanate hydrolase      Allophanate hydrolase   In enzymology , an allophanate hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   allophanate + 3 H 2 O + H +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2 HCO 3 − + 2 NH 4 +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are allophanate (urea-1-carboxylate or N -carbamoylcarbamate) and H 2 O , whereas its two products are HCO 3 − and NH 4 + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is urea-1-carboxylate amidohydrolase . This enzyme is also called allophanate lyase . This enzyme participates in urea cycle and metabolism of amino groups and atrazine degradation .
