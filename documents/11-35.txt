   6-carboxyhexanoate—CoA ligase      6-carboxyhexanoate—CoA ligase   In enzymology , a 6-carboxyhexanoate—CoA ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + 6-carboxyhexanoate + CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + 6-carboxyhexanoyl-CoA   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , 6-carboxyhexanoate , and CoA , whereas its 3 products are AMP , diphosphate , and 6-carboxyhexanoyl-CoA .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-sulfur bonds as acid-thiol ligases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-carboxyhexanoate:CoA ligase (AMP-forming) . Other names in common use include 6-carboxyhexanoyl-CoA synthetase , and pimelyl-CoA synthetase . This enzyme participates in biotin metabolism .  References      "  Category:EC 6.2.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
