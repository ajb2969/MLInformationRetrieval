CoA-glutathione reductase

In enzymology, a CoA-glutathione reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CoA + glutathione + NADP+

 
  CoA-glutathione + NADPH + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are CoA, glutathione, and NADP+, whereas its 3 products are CoA-glutathione, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is glutathione:NADP+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating). Other names in common use include coenzyme A glutathione disulfide reductase, NADPH-dependent coenzyme A-SS-glutathione reductase, coenzyme A disulfide-glutathione reductase, and NADPH:CoA-glutathione oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism. It employs one cofactor, FAD.
