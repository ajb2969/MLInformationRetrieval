   Binary cyclic group      Binary cyclic group   In mathematics , the binary cyclic group of the n -gon is the cyclic group of order 2 n ,    C   2  n      subscript  C    2  n     C_{2n}   , thought of as an extension of the cyclic group    C  n     subscript  C  n    C_{n}   by a cyclic group of order 2. It is the binary polyhedral group corresponding to the cyclic group. 1  In terms of binary polyhedral groups, the binary cyclic group is the preimage of the cyclic group of rotations (     C  n   <   SO   (  3  )         subscript  C  n    SO  3     C_{n}<\operatorname{SO}(3)   ) under the 2:1 covering homomorphism       Spin   (  3  )    →   SO   (  3  )       normal-→   Spin  3    SO  3     \operatorname{Spin}(3)\to\operatorname{SO}(3)\,   of the special orthogonal group by the spin group .  As a subgroup of the spin group, the binary cyclic group can be described concretely as a discrete subgroup of the unit quaternions , under the isomorphism     Spin   (  3  )    ≅   Sp   (  1  )         Spin  3    Sp  1     \operatorname{Spin}(3)\cong\operatorname{Sp}(1)   where Sp(1) is the multiplicative group of unit quaternions. (For a description of this homomorphism see the article on quaternions and spatial rotations .)
