Binary cyclic group

In mathematics, the binary cyclic group of the n-gon is the cyclic group of order 2n, 
 
 
 
 , thought of as an extension of the cyclic group 
 
 
 
  by a cyclic group of order 2. It is the binary polyhedral group corresponding to the cyclic group.1
In terms of binary polyhedral groups, the binary cyclic group is the preimage of the cyclic group of rotations (
 
 
 
 ) under the 2:1 covering homomorphism


 
  of the special orthogonal group by the spin group.
As a subgroup of the spin group, the binary cyclic group can be described concretely as a discrete subgroup of the unit quaternions, under the isomorphism 
 
 
 
  where Sp(1) is the multiplicative group of unit quaternions. (For a description of this homomorphism see the article on quaternions and spatial rotations.)
