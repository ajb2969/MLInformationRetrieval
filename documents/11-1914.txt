   Variational vector field      Variational vector field   In the mathematical fields of the calculus of variations and differential geometry , the variational vector field is a certain type of vector field defined on the tangent bundle of a differentiable manifold which gives rise to variations along a vector field in the manifold itself.  Specifically, let X be a vector field on M . Then X generates a one-parameter group of local diffeomorphisms  Fl X t , the flow along X . The differential of Fl X t gives, for each t , a mapping       d   Fl  X  t    :    T  M   →   T  M       normal-:    d   superscript   subscript  Fl  X   t     normal-→    T  M     T  M      d\mathrm{Fl}_{X}^{t}:TM\to TM     where TM denotes the tangent bundle of M . This is a one-parameter group of local diffeomorphisms of the tangent bundle. The variational vector field of X , denoted by T ( X ) is the tangent to the flow of d Fl X t .
