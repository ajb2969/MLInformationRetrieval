   Word (group theory)      Word (group theory)   In group theory , a word is any written product of group elements and their inverses. For example, if x , y and z are elements of a group G , then xy , z −1 xzz and y −1 zxx −1 yz −1 are words in the set { x , y , z }. Two different words may evaluate to the same value in G , 1 or even in every group. 2 Words play an important role in the theory of free groups and presentations , and are central objects of study in combinatorial group theory .  Definition  Let G be a group, and let S be a subset of G . A word in S is any expression of the form       s  1   ε  1     s  2   ε  2    ⋯   s  n   ε  n         superscript   subscript  s  1    subscript  ε  1     superscript   subscript  s  2    subscript  ε  2    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  s  n    subscript  ε  n      s_{1}^{\varepsilon_{1}}s_{2}^{\varepsilon_{2}}\cdots s_{n}^{\varepsilon_{n}}   where s 1 ,..., s n are elements of S and each ε i is ±1. The number n is known as the length of the word.  Each word in S represents an element of G , namely the product of the expression. By convention, the identity (unique) 3 element can be represented by the empty word , which is the unique word of length zero.  Notation  When writing words, it is common to use exponential notation as an abbreviation. For example, the word      x  x   y   -  1    z  y  z  z  z   x   -  1      x   -  1         x  x   superscript  y    1    z  y  z  z  z   superscript  x    1     superscript  x    1      xxy^{-1}zyzzzx^{-1}x^{-1}\,   could be written as        x  2    y   -  1    z  y   z  3    x   -  2     .       superscript  x  2    superscript  y    1    z  y   superscript  z  3    superscript  x    2      x^{2}y^{-1}zyz^{3}x^{-2}.\,   This latter expression is not a word itself—it is simply a shorter notation for the original.  When dealing with long words, it can be helpful to use an overline to denote inverses of elements of S . Using overline notation, the above word would be written as follows:        x  2    y  ¯   z  y   z  3     x  ¯   2    .       superscript  x  2    normal-¯  y   z  y   superscript  z  3    superscript   normal-¯  x   2     x^{2}\overline{y}zyz^{3}\overline{x}^{2}.\,     Words and presentations  A subset S of a group G is called a generating set if every element of G can be represented by a word in S . If S is a generating set, a relation is a pair of words in S that represent the same element of G . These are usually written as equations, e.g.       x   -  1    y  x   =   y  2    .         superscript  x    1    y  x    superscript  y  2     x^{-1}yx=y^{2}.\,   A set   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   of relations defines G if every relation in G follows logically from those in   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   , using the axioms for a group . A presentation for G is a pair    ⟨  S  ∣  ℛ  ⟩     inner-product  S  ℛ    \langle S\mid\mathcal{R}\rangle   , where S is a generating set for G and   ℛ   ℛ   \mathcal{R}   is a defining set of relations.  For example, the Klein four-group can be defined by the presentation       ⟨   i  ,  j   ∣     i  2   =  1   ,     j  2   =  1   ,    i  j   =   j  i      ⟩   .     inner-product   i  j    formulae-sequence     superscript  i  2   1    formulae-sequence     superscript  j  2   1       i  j     j  i        \langle i,j\mid i^{2}=1,\,j^{2}=1,\,ij=ji\rangle.   Here 1 denotes the empty word, which represents the identity element.  When S is not a generating set for G , the set of elements represented by words in S is a subgroup of G . This is known as the subgroup of G generated by S , and is usually denoted    ⟨  S  ⟩     delimited-⟨⟩  S    \langle S\rangle   . It is the smallest subgroup of G that contains the elements of S .  Reduced words  Any word in which a generator appears next to its own inverse ( xx −1 or x −1 x ) can be simplified by omitting the redundant pair:         y   -  1    z  x   x   -  1     y    ⟶    y   -  1    z  y    .     normal-⟶     superscript  y    1    z  x   superscript  x    1    y      superscript  y    1    z  y     y^{-1}zxx^{-1}y\;\;\longrightarrow\;\;y^{-1}zy.   This operation is known as reduction , and it does not change the group element represented by the word. (Reductions can be thought of as relations that follow from the group axioms.)  A reduced word is a word that contains no redundant pairs. Any word can be simplified to a reduced word by performing a sequence of reductions:        x  z   y   -  1    x   x   -  1    y   z   -  1    z   z   -  1    y   z    ⟶   x  y  z    .     normal-⟶    x  z   superscript  y    1    x   superscript  x    1    y   superscript  z    1    z   superscript  z    1    y  z     x  y  z     xzy^{-1}xx^{-1}yz^{-1}zz^{-1}yz\;\;\longrightarrow\;\;xyz.   The result does not depend on the order in which the reductions are performed.  If S is any set, the free group over S is the group with presentation    ⟨  S  ∣  ⟩     fragments  normal-⟨  S  normal-∣  normal-⟩    \langle S\mid\;\rangle   . That is, the free group over S is the group generated by the elements of S , with no extra relations. Every element of the free group can be written uniquely as a reduced word in S .  A word is cyclically reduced  if and only if every cyclic permutation of the word is reduced.  Normal forms  A normal form for a group G with generating set S is a choice of one reduced word in S for each element of G . For example:   The words 1, i , j , ij are a normal form for the Klein four-group .  The words 1, r , r 2 , ..., r n-1 , s , sr , ..., sr n-1 are a normal form for the dihedral group Dih n .  The set of reduced words in S are a normal form for the free group over S .  The set of words of the form x m y n for m,n ∈ Z are a normal form for the direct product of the cyclic groups 〈 x 〉 and 〈 y 〉.   Operations on words  The product of two words is obtained by concatenation:         (   x  z  y   z   -  1     )    (   z   y   -  1     x   -  1    y   )    =   x  z  y   z   -  1    z   y   -  1     x   -  1    y    .          x  z  y   superscript  z    1       z   superscript  y    1     superscript  x    1    y      x  z  y   superscript  z    1    z   superscript  y    1     superscript  x    1    y     \left(xzyz^{-1}\right)\left(zy^{-1}x^{-1}y\right)=xzyz^{-1}zy^{-1}x^{-1}y.   Even if the two words are reduced, the product may not be.  The inverse of a word is obtained by inverting each generator, and switching the order of the elements:         (   z   y   -  1     x   -  1    y   )    -  1    =    y   -  1    x  y   z   -  1      .       superscript    z   superscript  y    1     superscript  x    1    y     1       superscript  y    1    x  y   superscript  z    1       \left(zy^{-1}x^{-1}y\right)^{-1}=y^{-1}xyz^{-1}.   The product of a word with its inverse can be reduced to the empty word:       z   y   -  1     x   -  1     y    y   -  1    x  y   z   -  1     =  1.        z   superscript  y    1     superscript  x    1    y   superscript  y    1    x  y   superscript  z    1     1.    zy^{-1}x^{-1}y\;y^{-1}xyz^{-1}=1.     You can move a generator from the beginning to the end of a word by conjugation :         x   -  1     (   x   y   -  1     z   -  1    y  z   )   x   =    y   -  1     z   -  1    y  z  x    .         superscript  x    1      x   superscript  y    1     superscript  z    1    y  z   x      superscript  y    1     superscript  z    1    y  z  x     x^{-1}\left(xy^{-1}z^{-1}yz\right)x=y^{-1}z^{-1}yzx.     The word problem  Given a presentation    ⟨  S  ∣  ℛ  ⟩     inner-product  S  ℛ    \langle S\mid\mathcal{R}\rangle   for a group G , the word problem is the algorithmic problem of deciding, given as input two words in S , whether they represent the same element of G . The word problem is one of three algorithmic problems for groups proposed by Max Dehn in 1911. It was shown by Pyotr Novikov in 1955 that there exists a finitely presented group G such that the word problem for G is undecidable .  References    .
