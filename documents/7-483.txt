Particle number operator

In quantum mechanics, for systems where the total number of particles may not be preserved, the number operator is the observable that counts the number of particles.
The number operator acts on Fock space. Let



be a Fock state, composed of single-particle states 
 
 
 
  drawn from a basis of the underlying Hilbert space of the Fock space. Given the corresponding creation and annihilation operators

 
  and 
 
 
 
  we define the number operator by



and we have



where 
 
 
 
  is the number of particles in state 
 
 
 
 . The above equality can be proven by noting that


 
  then
