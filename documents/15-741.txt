Multipole magnet

Multipole magnets are magnets built from multiple individual magnets, typically used to control beams of charged particles. Each type of magnet serves a particular purpose.

Dipole magnets are used to bend the trajectory of particles
Quadrupole magnets are used to focus particle beams
Sextupole magnets are used to correct for chromaticity introduced by quadrupole magnets 1

Magnetic field equations
The magnetic field of an ideal multipole magnet in an accelerators is typically modeled as having no (or a constant) component parallel to the nominal beam direction (
 
 
 
  direction) and the for the transverse components can be written as complex numbers:2


where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the coordinates in the plane transverse to the nominal beam direction. 
 
 
 
  is a complex number specifying the orientation and strength of the magnetic field. 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are the components of the magnetic field in the corresponding directions. Fields with a real 
 
 
 
  are called 'normal' while fields with 
 
 
 
  purely imaginary are called 'skewed'.
