Dry Lake Wind Power Project

Dry Lake Wind Power Project in Navajo County is Arizona's first utility-scale wind farm. Phase 1 consists of 30 Suzlon 2.1 MW wind turbines, for a total nameplate capacity of 63 MW.12 Iberdrola Renewables built the wind farm for $100 million,3 and sells the output to Salt River Project. Based on wind measurements before construction began, Iberdrola estimates phase 1 will produce an average of 132,450 MWh annually.4 This implies a capacity factor of:



History
Around 2003, rancher Bill Elkins began working with Northern Arizona University scientists to erect measurement towers on his land to measure wind speeds. He studied the local power grid to determine the feasibility of connecting a wind farm. Navajo County and Iberdrola officials credit Elkins with attracting the first wind farm to Arizona.5
Future development
As of 2009, Iberdrola planned to install 209 more turbines in future construction phases.6
Phase 2 will consist of up to 31 Suzlon wind turbines for a combined nameplate capacity of 65 MW.7 The location of phase 2 () will be about seven miles (11 km) northwest of Snowflake and three miles (5 km) east of phase 1.8
Environmental effect
According to the USDOE, each 1000 MW of wind power capacity installed in Arizona will save  of water per year and eliminate 2.0 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions.9 Phase 1 of Dry Lake Wind Power Project would then eliminate:



of carbon dioxide, and save:



of water annually.
