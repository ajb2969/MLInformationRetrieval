   Planck particle      Planck particle  A '''Planck particle''', named after physicist [[Max Planck]], is a hypothetical particle defined as a tiny [[black hole]] whose [[Compton wavelength]] is equal to its Schwarzschild  radius . 1 Its mass is thus approximately the Planck mass, and its Compton wavelength and Schwarzschild radius are about the Planck length. 2 Planck particles are sometimes used as an exercise to define the Planck mass and Planck length. 3 They play a role in some models of the evolution of the universe during the Planck  epoch . 4  Compared to a proton , for example, the Planck particle would be extremely small (its radius being equal to the Planck length , which is about 10 −20 times the proton's radius) and heavy (the Planck mass being 10 19 times the proton's mass).  It is thought that such a particle would vanish in Hawking radiation .  Derivation  While opinions vary as to its proper definition, the most common definition of a Planck particle is a particle whose Compton wavelength is equal to its Schwarzschild radius . This sets the relationship:      λ  =   h   m  c    =    2  G  m    c  2          λ    h    m  c             2  G  m    superscript  c  2       \lambda=\frac{h}{mc}=\frac{2Gm}{c^{2}}     Thus making the mass of such a particle:      m  =     h  c    2  G         m        h  c     2  G       m=\sqrt{\frac{hc}{2G}}     This mass will be    π      π    \sqrt{\pi}   times larger than the Planck mass , making a Planck particle 1.772 times more massive than the Planck unit mass.  Its radius will be the Compton wavelength:      r  =   h   m  c    =     2  G  h    c  3           r    h    m  c               2  G  h    superscript  c  3        r=\frac{h}{mc}=\sqrt{\frac{2Gh}{c^{3}}}     Dimensions  Using the above derivations we can substitute the universal constants h , G , and c , and determine physical values for the particle's mass and radius. Assuming this radius represents a sphere of uniform density we can further determine the particle's volume and density.
