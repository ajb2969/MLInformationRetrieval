(Figure)  Finding the largest empty circle using the Voronoi diagram (two solutions).   In computational geometry , the largest empty sphere problem is the problem of finding a hypersphere of largest radius in d -dimensional space whose interior does not overlap with any given obstacles.  Two dimensions  The largest empty circle problem is the problem of finding a circle of largest radius in the plane whose interior does not overlap with any given obstacles.  A common special case is as follows. Given n points in the plane, find a largest circle centered within their convex hull and enclosing none of them. The problem may be solved using Voronoi diagrams in optimal time     Θ   (    n     log   n    )       normal-Θ    n    n      \Theta(n\,\log\,n)   . 1  See also   Bounding sphere  Farthest-first traversal  Largest empty rectangle   References  "  Category:Geometric algorithms     G.
