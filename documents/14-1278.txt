   Tikhonov's theorem (dynamical systems)      Tikhonov's theorem (dynamical systems)   In applied mathematics, Tikhonov's theorem on dynamical systems is a result on stability of solutions of systems of differential equations . It has applications to chemical kinetics . 1 The theorem is named after Andrey Nikolayevich Tikhonov .  Statement  Consider this system of differential equations:        d  𝐱    d  t          d  𝐱     d  t     \displaystyle\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt}     Taking the limit as    μ  →  0     normal-→  μ  0    \mu\to 0   , this becomes the "degenerate system":        d  𝐱    d  t          d  𝐱     d  t     \displaystyle\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt}     where the second equation is the solution of the algebraic equation       𝐠   (  𝐱  ,  𝐳  ,  t  )    =   0.         𝐠   𝐱  𝐳  t    0.    \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},t)=0.\,     Note that there may be more than one such function φ .  Tikhonov's theorem states that as     μ  →  0   ,     normal-→  μ  0    \mu\to 0,\,   the solution of the system of two differential equations above approaches the solution of the degenerate system if    𝐳  =   φ   (  𝐱  ,  t  )        𝐳    φ   𝐱  t      \mathbf{z}=\varphi(\mathbf{x},t)   is a stable root of the "adjoined system"         d  𝐳    d  t    =   𝐠   (  𝐱  ,  𝐳  ,  t  )     .          d  𝐳     d  t      𝐠   𝐱  𝐳  t      \frac{d\mathbf{z}}{dt}=\mathbf{g}(\mathbf{x},\mathbf{z},t).
