   Ran space      Ran space   In mathematics, the Ran space (or Ran's space ) of a topological space  X is a topological space $\operatorname{Ran}(X)$ whose underlying set is the set of all nonempty finite subsets of X : for a metric space X the topology is given by Hausdorff distance . The notion is named after Ziv Ran . It seems the notion was first introduced and popularized by A. Beilinson and V. Drinfeld, Chiral algebras .  In general, the topology of the Ran space is generated by sets  $$\{ S \in \operatorname{Ran}(U_1 \cup \dots \cup U_m) \mid S \cap U_1 \ne \emptyset, \dots, S \cap U_m \ne \emptyset \}$$  for any disjoint open subsets $U_i \subset X, 1 \le i \le m$ .  A theorem of Beilinson and Drinfeld states that the Ran space of a connected manifold is weakly contractible . 1  There is an analog of a Ran space for a scheme: 2 the Ran prestack of a quasi-projective scheme  X over a field k , denoted by $\operatorname{Ran}(X)$ , is the category where the objects are triples $(R, S, \mu)$ consisting of a finitely generated k -algebra R , a nonempty set S and a map of sets $\mu: S \to X(R)$ and where a morphism $(R, S, \mu) \to (R', S', \mu')$ consists of a k -algebra homomorphism $R \to R'$ , a surjective map $S \to S'$ that commutes with $\mu$ and $\mu'$ . Roughly, an R -point of $\operatorname{Ran}(X)$ is a nonempty finite set of R -rational points of X "with labels" given by $\mu$ . A theorem of Beilinson and Drinfeld continues to hold $$\operatorname{Ran}(X)$$ is acyclic if X is connected.  Topological chiral homology  If F is a cosheaf on the Ran space $\operatorname{Ran}(M)$ , then its space of global sections is called the topological chiral homology of M with coefficients in F . If A is, roughly, a family of commutative algebras parametrized by points in M , then there is a factorizable sheaf associated to A . Via this construction, one also obtains the topological chiral homology with coefficients in A . The construction is a generalization of Hochschild homology . 3  See also   Chiral homology  Exponential space   Notes  References   D.
