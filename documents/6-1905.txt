Thermal velocity

The thermal velocity or thermal speed is a typical velocity of the thermal motion of particles which make up a gas, liquid, etc. Thus, indirectly, thermal velocity is a measure of temperature. Technically speaking it is a measure of the width of the peak in the Maxwellâ€“Boltzmann particle velocity distribution. Note that in the strictest sense thermal velocity is not a velocity, since velocity usually describes a vector rather than simply a scalar speed.
Since the thermal velocity is only a "typical" velocity, a number of different definitions can be and are used.
Taking 
 
 
 
  to be the Boltzmann constant, 
 
 
 
  is the temperature, and 
 
 
 
  is the mass of a particle, then we can write the different thermal velocities:
In one dimension
If 
 
 
 
  is defined as the root mean square of the velocity in any one dimension (i.e. any single direction), then


 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is defined as the mean of the magnitude of the velocity in any one dimension (i.e. any single direction), then


 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is defined as the 
 
 
 
  half-width of the thermal distribution or
if 
 
 
 
  is defined such that a particle with this speed has an energy of 
 
 
 
 , then


 
 .
By all of these definitions 
 
 
 
  falls in the range of


 
 .
In three dimensions
If 
 
 
 
  is defined as the most probable speed, then


 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is defined as the root mean square of the total velocity (in three dimensions), then


 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  is defined as the mean of the magnitude of the velocity of the atoms or molecules, then


 
 .
By all of these definitions 
 
 
 
  falls in the range of
