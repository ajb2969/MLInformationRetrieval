   Thermal velocity      Thermal velocity   The thermal velocity or thermal speed is a typical velocity of the thermal motion of particles which make up a gas, liquid, etc. Thus, indirectly, thermal velocity is a measure of temperature. Technically speaking it is a measure of the width of the peak in the Maxwell–Boltzmann particle velocity distribution . Note that in the strictest sense thermal velocity is not a velocity , since velocity usually describes a vector rather than simply a scalar  speed .  Since the thermal velocity is only a "typical" velocity, a number of different definitions can be and are used.  Taking    k  B     subscript  k  B    k_{B}   to be the Boltzmann constant ,   T   T   T   is the temperature, and   m   m   m   is the mass of a particle, then we can write the different thermal velocities:  In one dimension  If    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   is defined as the root mean square of the velocity in any one dimension (i.e. any single direction), then       v   t  h    =      k  B   T   m         subscript  v    t  h           subscript  k  B   T   m      v_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{k_{B}T}{m}}   .  If    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   is defined as the mean of the magnitude of the velocity in any one dimension (i.e. any single direction), then       v   t  h    =     2   k  B   T    π  m          subscript  v    t  h          2   subscript  k  B   T     π  m       v_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{2k_{B}T}{\pi m}}   .  If    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   is defined as the    1  /  e      1  e    1/e   half-width of the thermal distribution or  if    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   is defined such that a particle with this speed has an energy of     k  B   T       subscript  k  B   T    k_{B}T   , then       v   t  h    =     2   k  B   T   m         subscript  v    t  h          2   subscript  k  B   T   m      v_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{2k_{B}T}{m}}   .  By all of these definitions    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   falls in the range of       v   t  h    =    (   1.1  ±  0.3   )       k  B   T   m          subscript  v    t  h       plus-or-minus  1.1  0.3          subscript  k  B   T   m       v_{th}=(1.1\pm 0.3)\sqrt{\frac{k_{B}T}{m}}   .  In three dimensions  If    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   is defined as the most probable speed, then       v   t  h    =     2   k  B   T   m         subscript  v    t  h          2   subscript  k  B   T   m      v_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{2k_{B}T}{m}}   .  If    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   is defined as the root mean square of the total velocity (in three dimensions), then       v   t  h    =     3   k  B   T   m         subscript  v    t  h          3   subscript  k  B   T   m      v_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{3k_{B}T}{m}}   .  If    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   is defined as the mean of the magnitude of the velocity of the atoms or molecules, then       v   t  h    =     8   k  B   T    m  π          subscript  v    t  h          8   subscript  k  B   T     m  π       v_{th}=\sqrt{\frac{8k_{B}T}{m\pi}}   .  By all of these definitions    v   t  h      subscript  v    t  h     v_{th}   falls in the range of       v   t  h    =    (   1.6  ±  0.2   )       k  B   T   m          subscript  v    t  h       plus-or-minus  1.6  0.2          subscript  k  B   T   m       v_{th}=(1.6\pm 0.2)\sqrt{\frac{k_{B}T}{m}}   .
