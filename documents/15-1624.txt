D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase




D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase

D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase (, D-beta-D-heptose 7-phosphate kinase/D-beta-D-heptose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase, D-glycero-D-manno-heptose-1beta-phosphate adenylyltransferase, hldE (gene), rfaE (gene)) is an enzyme with system name ATP:D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate adenylyltransferase.1234 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose 1-phosphate + ATP 
 
 
 
  ADP-D-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose + diphosphate


The enzyme is involved in biosynthesis of ADP-L-glycero-beta-D-manno-heptose.
