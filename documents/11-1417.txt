5-methyldeoxycytidine-5'-phosphate kinase

In enzymology, a 5-methyldeoxycytidine-5'-phosphate kinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + 5-methyldeoxycytidine 5'-phosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 5-methyldeoxycytidine diphosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and 5-methyldeoxycytidine 5'-phosphate, whereas its two products are ADP and 5-methyldeoxycytidine diphosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:5-methyldeoxycytidine-5'-phosphate phosphotransferase.
