   Aldose-6-phosphate reductase (NADPH)      Aldose-6-phosphate reductase (NADPH)   In enzymology , an aldose-6-phosphate reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   D-sorbitol 6-phosphate + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   D-glucose 6-phosphate + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are D-sorbitol 6-phosphate and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are D-glucose 6-phosphate , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-aldose-6-phosphate:NADP + 1-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include aldose 6-phosphate reductase , NADP + -dependent aldose 6-phosphate reductase , A6PR , aldose-6-P reductase , aldose-6-phosphate reductase , alditol 6-phosphate:NADP + 1-oxidoreductase , and aldose-6-phosphate reductase (NADPH) .
