   Metric map      Metric map   In the mathematical theory of metric spaces , a metric map is a function between metric spaces that does not increase any distance (such functions are always continuous ). These maps are the morphisms in the category of metric spaces , Met (Isbell 1964). They are also called Lipschitz functions with Lipschitz constant 1, nonexpansive maps , nonexpanding maps , weak contractions , or short maps .  Specifically, suppose that X and Y are metric spaces and ∆í is a function from X to Y . Thus we have a metric map when, for any points x and y in X ,         d  Y    (   f   (  x  )    ,   f   (  y  )    )    ‚â§    d  X    (  x  ,  y  )     .         subscript  d  Y      f  x     f  y        subscript  d  X    x  y      d_{Y}(f(x),f(y))\leq d_{X}(x,y).\!   Here d X and d Y denote the metrics on X and Y respectively.  Category of metric maps  A map ∆í between metric spaces is an isometry if and only if 1) it is metric, 2) it is a bijection , and 3) its inverse is also metric. The composite of metric maps is also metric. Thus metric spaces and metric maps form a category  Met ; Met is a subcategory of the category of metric spaces and Lipschitz functions, and the isomorphisms in Met are the isometries.  Strictly metric maps  One can say that ∆í is strictly metric if the inequality is strict for every two different points. Thus a contraction mapping is strictly metric, but not necessarily the other way around. Note that an isometry is never strictly metric, except in the degenerate case of the empty space or a single-point space.  Multivalued version  A mapping    T  :   X  ‚Üí   ùí©   (  X  )        normal-:  T   normal-‚Üí  X    ùí©  X      T:X\to\mathcal{N}(X)   from a metric space X to the family of nonempty subsets of X is said to be Lipschitz if there exists    L  ‚â•  0      L  0    L\geq 0   such that        H   (   T  x   ,   T  y   )    ‚â§   L  d   (  x  ,  y  )     ,        H     T  x     T  y       L  d   x  y      H(Tx,Ty)\leq Ld(x,y),   for all     x  ,  y   ‚àà  X       x  y   X    x,y\in X   , where H is the Hausdorff distance . When    L  =  1      L  1    L=1   , T is called nonexpansive and when    L  <  1      L  1    L<1   , T is called a contraction .
