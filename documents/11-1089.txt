   Glutamine—pyruvate transaminase      Glutamine—pyruvate transaminase   In enzymology , a glutamine-pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamine + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-oxoglutaramate + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamine and pyruvate , whereas its two products are 2-oxoglutarate and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamine:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include glutaminase II , L-glutamine transaminase L , and glutamine-oxo-acid transaminase . This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
