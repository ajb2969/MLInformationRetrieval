   Geroch's splitting theorem      Geroch's splitting theorem   In the theory of causal structure on Lorentzian manifolds , Geroch's theorem or Geroch's splitting theorem (first proved by Robert Geroch ) gives a topological characterization of globally hyperbolic spacetimes.  The theorem  Let    (  M  ,   g   a  b    )     M   subscript  g    a  b      (M,g_{ab})   be a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Then    (  M  ,   g   a  b    )     M   subscript  g    a  b      (M,g_{ab})   is strongly causal and there exists a global "time function" on the manifold, i.e. a continuous, surjective map    f  :   M  →  ℝ      normal-:  f   normal-→  M  ℝ     f:M\rightarrow\mathbb{R}   such that:   For all    t  ∈  ℝ      t  ℝ    t\in\mathbb{R}   ,     f   -  1     (  t  )        superscript  f    1    t    f^{-1}(t)   is a Cauchy surface , and     f   f   f   is strictly increasing on any causal curve .   Moreover, all Cauchy surfaces are homeomorphic, and   M   M   M   is homeomorphic to    S  ×  ℝ      S  ℝ    S\times\mathbb{R}   where   S   S   S   is any Cauchy surface of   M   M   M   .
