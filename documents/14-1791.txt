Geroch's splitting theorem

In the theory of causal structure on Lorentzian manifolds, Geroch's theorem or Geroch's splitting theorem (first proved by Robert Geroch) gives a topological characterization of globally hyperbolic spacetimes.
The theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a globally hyperbolic spacetime. Then 
 
 
 
  is strongly causal and there exists a global "time function" on the manifold, i.e. a continuous, surjective map 
 
 
 
  such that:

For all 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a Cauchy surface, and


 
  is strictly increasing on any causal curve.

Moreover, all Cauchy surfaces are homeomorphic, and 
 
 
 
  is homeomorphic to 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is any Cauchy surface of
