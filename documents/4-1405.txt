   L√©vy process      L√©vy process   In probability theory , a L√©vy process , named after the French mathematician Paul L√©vy , is a stochastic process with independent, stationary increments: it represents the motion of a point whose successive displacements are random and independent, and statistically identical over different time intervals of the same length. A L√©vy process may thus be viewed as the continuous-time analog of a random walk .  The most well known examples of L√©vy processes are Brownian motion and the Poisson process . Aside from Brownian motion with drift, all other L√©vy processes, except the deterministic case, have discontinuous paths.  Mathematical definition  A stochastic process     X  =   {   X  t   :   t  ‚â•  0   }       X   conditional-set   subscript  X  t     t  0      X=\{X_{t}:t\geq 0\}   is said to be a L√©vy process if it satisfies the following properties:        X  0   =   0        subscript  X  0   0    X_{0}=0\,    almost surely  Independence of increments: For any     X   t  -  s    .     subscript  X    t  s     X_{t-s}.\,   are independent  Stationary increments: For any    œµ  >  0      œµ  0    \epsilon>0   is equal in distribution to    t  ‚â•  0      t  0    t\geq 0     Continuity in probability: For any     lim   h  ‚Üí  0    P   (  |   X   t  +  h    -   X  t   |  >  œµ  )   =  0     fragments   subscript    normal-‚Üí  h  0    P   fragments  normal-(  normal-|   subscript  X    t  h      subscript  X  t   normal-|   œµ  normal-)    0    \lim_{h\rightarrow 0}P(|X_{t+h}-X_{t}|>\epsilon)=0   and   X   X   X   it holds that   X   X   X      If    t  ‚Ü¶   X  t      maps-to  t   subscript  X  t     t\mapsto X_{t}   is a L√©vy process then one may construct a version of   X   X   X   such that   X   X   X   is almost surely  right continuous with left limits .  Properties  Independent increments  A continuous-time stochastic process assigns a random variable  X t to each point t ‚â• 0 in time. In effect it is a random function of t . The increments of such a process are the differences X s ‚àí X t between its values at different times t  s ‚àí X t and X u ‚àí X v are independent random variables whenever the two time intervals do not overlap and, more generally, any finite number of increments assigned to pairwise non-overlapping time intervals are mutually (not just pairwise ) independent.  Stationary increments  To call the increments stationary means that the probability distribution of any increment X t ‚àí X s depends only on the length t ‚àí s of the time interval; increments on equally long time intervals are identically distributed.  If   F   F   F   is a Wiener process , the probability distribution of X t ‚àí X s is normal with expected value 0 and variance  t ‚àí s .  If   X   X   X   is the Poisson process , the probability distribution of X t ‚àí X s is a Poisson distribution with expected value Œª( t ‚àí s ), where Œª > 0 is the "intensity" or "rate" of the process.  Infinite divisibility  The distribution of a L√©vy process has the property of infinite divisibility : given any integer "n", the law of a L√©vy process at time t can be represented as the law of n independent random variables, which are precisely the increments of the L√©vy process over time intervals of length t / n, which are independent and identically distributed by assumption. Conversely, for each infinitely divisible probability distribution    X  1     subscript  X  1    X_{1}   , there is a L√©vy process   F   F   F   such that the law of      Œº  n    (  t  )    =   E   (   X  t  n   )           subscript  Œº  n   t     E   superscript   subscript  X  t   n      \mu_{n}(t)=E(X_{t}^{n})   is given by       Œº  n    (   t  +  s   )    =    ‚àë   k  =  0   n     (     n      k     )    Œº  k    (  t  )    Œº   n  -  k     (  s  )      .         subscript  Œº  n     t  s      superscript   subscript     k  0    n      binomial  n  k    subscript  Œº  k   t   subscript  Œº    n  k    s      \mu_{n}(t+s)=\sum_{k=0}^{n}{n\choose k}\mu_{k}(t)\mu_{n-k}(s).   .  Moments  In any L√©vy process with finite moments , the n th moment    X  =    (   X  t   )    t  ‚â•  0        X   subscript   subscript  X  t     t  0      X=(X_{t})_{t\geq 0}   , is a polynomial function of t ; these functions satisfy a binomial identity :       œï  X    (  Œ∏  )        subscript  œï  X   Œ∏    \phi_{X}(\theta)     L√©vy‚ÄìKhintchine representation  The distribution of a L√©vy process is characterized by its characteristic function , which is given by the L√©vy‚ÄìKhintchine formula : If      œï  X    (  Œ∏  )    :=   ùîº   [   e   i  Œ∏   X  1     ]    =   exp   (     a  i  Œ∏   -    1  2    œÉ  2    Œ∏  2     +    ‚à´   ‚Ñù  \   {  0  }       (    e   i  Œ∏  x    -  1  -   i  Œ∏  x   ùêà    |  x  |   <  1      )   Œ†   (   d  x   )      )         assign     subscript  œï  X   Œ∏     ùîº   delimited-[]   superscript  e    i  Œ∏   subscript  X  1                    a  i  Œ∏       1  2    superscript  œÉ  2    superscript  Œ∏  2       subscript    normal-\  ‚Ñù   0          superscript  e    i  Œ∏  x    1    i  Œ∏  x   subscript  ùêà      x   1      normal-Œ†    d  x          \phi_{X}(\theta):=\mathbb{E}\Big[e^{i\theta X_{1}}\Big]=\exp\Bigg(ai\theta-%

These three components, and thus the L√©vy‚ÄìKhintchine representation, are fully determined by the L√©vy‚ÄìKhintchine triplet    X   (  1  )      superscript  X  1    X^{(1)}   . In particular, the only (nondeterministic) continuous L√©vy process is a Brownian motion with drift.  L√©vy‚ÄìIt≈ç decomposition  Any L√©vy process may be decomposed into the sum of a Brownian motion , a linear drift and a pure jump process which captures all jumps of the original L√©vy process. The latter can be thought of as a superposition of centered compound Poisson processes .This result is known as the L√©vy‚ÄìIt≈ç decomposition.  Given a L√©vy triplet    X   (  2  )      superscript  X  2    X^{(2)}   there exist three independent L√©vy processes, which lie in the same probability space,    X   (  3  )      superscript  X  3    X^{(3)}   ,    X   (  1  )      superscript  X  1    X^{(1)}   ,    œÉ  2     superscript  œÉ  2    \sigma^{2}   such that:       X   (  2  )      superscript  X  2    X^{(2)}   is a Brownian motion with drift, corresponding to the absolutely continuous part of a measure and capturing the drift a and diffusion    X   (  3  )      superscript  X  3    X^{(3)}   ;      X  =    X   (  1  )    +   X   (  2  )    +   X   (  3  )         X     superscript  X  1    superscript  X  2    superscript  X  3      X=X^{(1)}+X^{(2)}+X^{(3)}   is a compound Poisson process , corresponding to the pure point part of the singular measure W ;      (  a  ,   œÉ  2   ,  Œ†  )     a   superscript  œÉ  2   normal-Œ†    (a,\sigma^{2},\Pi)   is a square integrable pure jump martingale that almost surely has a countable number of jumps on a finite interval, corresponding to the singular continuous part of the singular measure W .   The process defined by    X   (  3  )      superscript  X  3    X^{(3)}   is then a L√©vy process with triplet   1   1   1   .  The process $X^{(3)}$ can be further decomposed as a sum of two independent processes the first pure jump zero mean martingale of jumps less than $1$ In absolute value and the second a compound Poisson process describing the jumps bigger than one in absolute value.
