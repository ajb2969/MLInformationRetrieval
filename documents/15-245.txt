Gamma/Gompertz distribution

In probability and statistics, the Gamma/Gompertz distribution is a continuous probability distribution. It has been used as an aggregate-level model of customer lifetime and a model of mortality risks.
Specification
Probability density function
The probability density function of the Gamma/Gompertz distribution is:



where 
 
 
 
  is the scale parameter and 
 
 
 
  are the shape parameters of the Gamma/Gompertz distribution.
Cumulative distribution function
The cumulative distribution function of the Gamma/Gompertz distribution is:



Moment generating function
The moment generating function is given by:


 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a Hypergeometric function.
Properties
The Gamma/Gompertz distribution is a flexible distribution that can be skewed to the right or to the left.
Related distributions

When β = 1, this reduces to an Exponential distribution with parameter sb.
The gamma distribution is a natural conjugate prior to a Gompertz likelihood with known, scale parameter 
 
 
1
When the shape parameter 
 
 
 
  of a Gompertz distribution varies according to a gamma distribution with shape parameter 
 
 
 
  and scale parameter 
 
 
 
  (mean = 
 
 
 
 ), the distribution of 
 
 
 
  is Gamma/Gompertz.2
