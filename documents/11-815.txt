   1-alkenylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase      1-alkenylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase   In enzymology , a 1-alkenylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   acyl-CoA + 1-alkenylglycerophosphocholine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + 1-alkenyl-2-acylglycerophosphocholine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are acyl-CoA and 1-alkenylglycerophosphocholine , whereas its two products are CoA and 1-alkenyl-2-acylglycerophosphocholine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is acyl-CoA:1-alkenylglycerophosphocholine O-acyltransferase . This enzyme participates in ether lipid metabolism .
