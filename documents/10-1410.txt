Peptide-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase

In enzymology, a peptide-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

peptide tryptophan + O2

 
  peptide formylkynurenine
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are peptide tryptophan and O2, whereas its product is peptide formylkynurenine.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on single donors with O2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2. The systematic name of this enzyme class is peptide-tryptophan:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (decyclizing). Other names in common use include pyrrolooxygenase, peptidyltryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase, and tryptophan pyrrolooxygenase.
