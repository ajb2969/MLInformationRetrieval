   Peptide-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase      Peptide-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase   In enzymology , a peptide-tryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   peptide tryptophan + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   peptide formylkynurenine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are peptide tryptophan and O 2 , whereas its product is peptide formylkynurenine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on single donors with O 2 as oxidant and incorporation of two atoms of oxygen into the substrate (oxygenases). The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O 2 . The systematic name of this enzyme class is peptide-tryptophan:oxygen 2,3-oxidoreductase (decyclizing) . Other names in common use include pyrrolooxygenase , peptidyltryptophan 2,3-dioxygenase , and tryptophan pyrrolooxygenase .
