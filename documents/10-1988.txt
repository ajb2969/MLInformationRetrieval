   Methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase      Methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase   In enzymology , a methylmalonyl-CoA decarboxylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   propanoyl-CoA + CO 2    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA , and two products , propanoyl-CoA and CO 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the carboxy-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA carboxy-lyase (propanoyl-CoA-forming) . Other names in common use include propionyl-CoA carboxylase , propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase , methylmalonyl-coenzyme A decarboxylase , (S)-2-methyl-3-oxopropanoyl-CoA carboxy-lyase [incorrect] , and (S)-methylmalonyl-CoA carboxy-lyase . This enzyme participates in propanoate metabolism .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
