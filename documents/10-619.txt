   Tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase      Tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase   In enzymology , a tetrahydroxynaphthalene reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   scytalone + NADP +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene + NADPH + H +    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are scytalone and NADP + , whereas its 3 products are 1,3,6,8-tetrahydroxynaphthalene , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is scytalone:NADP + Delta5-oxidoreductase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
