   Komornik–Loreti constant      Komornik–Loreti constant   The Komornik–Loreti constant is a mathematical constant that represents the smallest number for which there still exists a unique q -development.  Definition  Given a real number q > 1, the series      x  =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n    q   -  n          x    superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript  q    n        x=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}q^{-n}     is called the q -expansion, or    β   β   \beta   -expansion , of the positive real number x if, for all    n  ≥  0      n  0    n\geq 0   ,    0  ≤   a  n   ≤   ⌊  q  ⌋         0   subscript  a  n          q      0\leq a_{n}\leq\lfloor q\rfloor   , where    ⌊  q  ⌋      q    \lfloor q\rfloor   is the floor function and    a  n     subscript  a  n    a_{n}   need not be an integer. Any real number   x   x   x   such that    0  ≤  x  ≤    q   ⌊  q  ⌋    /   (   q  -  1   )          0  x           q    q      q  1       0\leq x\leq q\lfloor q\rfloor/(q-1)   has such an expansion, as can be found using the greedy algorithm .  The special case of    x  =  1      x  1    x=1   ,     a  0   =  0       subscript  a  0   0    a_{0}=0   , and     a  n   =  0       subscript  a  n   0    a_{n}=0   or 1 is sometimes called a   q   q   q   -development.     a  n   =  1       subscript  a  n   1    a_{n}=1   gives the only 2-development. However, for almost all    1  <  q  <  2        1  q       2     1   , there are an infinite number of different   q   q   q   -developments. Even more surprisingly though, there exist exceptional    q  ∈   (  1  ,  2  )       q   1  2     q\in(1,2)   for which there exists only a single   q   q   q   -development. Furthermore, there is a smallest number    1  <  q  <  2        1  q       2     1   known as the Komornik–Loreti constant for which there exists a unique   q   q   q   -development. 1  The Komornik–Loreti constant is the value   q   q   q   such that      1  =    ∑   n  =  1   ∞     t  k    q  k         1    superscript   subscript     n  1         subscript  t  k    superscript  q  k       1=\sum_{n=1}^{\infty}\frac{t_{k}}{q^{k}}     where    t  k     subscript  t  k    t_{k}   is the Thue–Morse sequence , i.e.,    t  k     subscript  t  k    t_{k}   is the parity of the number of 1's in the binary representation of   k   k   k   . It has approximate value       q  =   1.787231650  …    .      q    1.787231650  normal-…     q=1.787231650\ldots.\,     The constant   q   q   q   is also the unique positive real root of        ∏   k  =  0   ∞    (   1  -   1   q   2  k      )    =     (   1  -   1  q    )    -  1    -  2.         superscript   subscript  product    k  0        1    1   superscript  q   superscript  2  k          superscript    1    1  q      1    2.     \prod_{k=0}^{\infty}\left(1-\frac{1}{q^{2^{k}}}\right)=\left(1-\frac{1}{q}%
 \right)^{-1}-2.     This constant is transcendental . 2  References  "  Category:Mathematical constants     Weissman, Eric W. "q-expansion" From Wolfram MathWorld . Retrieved on 2009-10-18. ↩  Weissman, Eric W. "Komornik–Loreti Constant." From Wolfram MathWorld . Retrieved on 2010-12-27. ↩
