   Portal:Electronics/Selected article/3      Portal:Electronics/Selected article/3    Electrical resistance is a measure of the degree to which an object opposes the passage of an electric current . The SI unit of electrical resistance is the ohm . Its reciprocal quantity is electrical conductance measured in siemens . The quantity of resistance in an electric circuit determines the amount of current flowing in the circuit for any given voltage applied to the circuit.      R  =   V  I       R    V  I     R=\frac{V}{I}     where; R is the resistance of the object, usually measured in ohms , equivalent to JÂ·s/C 2 , V is the potential difference across the object, usually measured in volts , I is the current passing through the object, usually measured in amperes . For a wide variety of materials and conditions, the electrical resistance does not depend on the amount of current flowing or the amount of applied voltage . V can either be measured directly across the object or calculated from a subtraction of voltages relative to a reference point."
