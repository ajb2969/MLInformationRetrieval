   L-lysine 6-oxidase      L-lysine 6-oxidase   In enzymology , a L-lysine 6-oxidase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-lysine + O 2 + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde + H 2 O 2 + NH 3    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are L-lysine , O 2 , and H 2 O , whereas its 3 products are 2-aminoadipate 6-semialdehyde , H 2 O 2 , and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-NH2 group of donors with oxygen as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-lysine:oxygen 6-oxidoreductase (deaminating) . Other names in common use include L-lysine-epsilon-oxidase , Lod , LodA , and marinocine .
