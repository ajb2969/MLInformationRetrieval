Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase




Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reactions

3-phospho-D-glycerate + NAD+

 
  3-phosphonooxypyruvate + NADH + H+

2-hydroxyglutarate + NAD+

 
  2-oxoglutarate + NADH + H+


Thus, in the first case, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3-phospho-D-glycerate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate, NADH, and H+; in the second case, the two substrates of this enzyme are 2-hydroxyglutarate and NAD+, whereas its 3 products are 2-oxoglutarate, NADH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor.
In humans, this enzyme is encoded by the PHGDH gene.1
Certain breast cancers are dependent on the overexpression of PHGDH.2
Clinical aspect
Homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in PHGDH cause Neu-Laxova syndrome34 and Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase deficiency.5
