   Isoquinoline 1-oxidoreductase      Isoquinoline 1-oxidoreductase   In enzymology , an isoquinoline 1-oxidoreductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   isoquinoline + acceptor + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   isoquinolin-1(2H)-one + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are isoquinoline , acceptor , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are isoquinolin-1(2H)-one and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is isoquinoline:acceptor 1-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating) .  References      "  Category:EC 1.3.99  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
