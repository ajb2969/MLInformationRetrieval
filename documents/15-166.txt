   Height zeta function      Height zeta function   In mathematics, the height zeta function of an algebraic variety or more generally a subset of a variety encodes the distribution of points of given height.  Definition  If S is a set with height function  H , such that there are only finitely many elements of bounded height, define a counting function        N   (  S  ,  H  ,  B  )    =   ♯   {   x  ∈  S   :    H   (  x  )    ≤  B   }     .        N   S  H  B      normal-♯   conditional-set    x  S       H  x   B       N(S,H,B)=\sharp\{x\in S:H(x)\leq B\}.     and a zeta function        Z   (  S  ,  H  ;  s  )    =    ∑   x  ∈  S     H    (  x  )    -  s       .        Z   S  H  s      subscript     x  S      H   superscript  x    s        Z(S,H;s)=\sum_{x\in S}H(x)^{-s}.     Properties  If Z has abscissa of convergence β and there is a constant c such that N has rate of growth      N  ∼   c   B  a     (   log  B   )    t  -  1        similar-to  N    c   superscript  B  a    superscript    B     t  1       N\sim cB^{a}(\log B)^{t-1}     then a version of the Wiener–Ikehara theorem holds: Z has a t -fold pole at s = β with residue c . a .Γ( t ).  The abscissa of convergence has similar formal properties to the Nevanlinna invariant and it is conjectured that they are essentially the same. More precisely, Batyrev–Manin conjectured the following. 1 Let X be a projective variety over a number field K with ample divisor D giving rise to an embedding and height function H , and let U denote a Zariski-open subset of X . Let α = α ( D ) be the Nevanlinna invariant of D and β the abscissa of convergence of Z ( U , H ; s ). Then for every ε > 0 there is a U such that β 0 then α = β for all sufficiently large fields K and sufficiently small U .
