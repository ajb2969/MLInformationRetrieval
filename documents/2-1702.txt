   Upper half-plane      Upper half-plane   In mathematics , the upper half-plane  H is the set of complex numbers with positive imaginary part :       ℍ  =   {   x  +   i   y     |    y  >   0  ;  x    ,   y  ∈  ℝ    }    .      ℍ   conditional-set    x    i  y     formulae-sequence    y   0  x      y  ℝ       \mathbb{H}=\{x+iy\;|y>0;x,y\in\mathbb{R}\}.     The term arises from a common visualization of the complex number x + iy as the point (x,y) in the plane endowed with Cartesian coordinates . When the Y-axis is oriented vertically, the "upper half-plane " corresponds to the region above the X-axis and thus complex numbers for which y > 0.  It is the domain of many functions of interest in complex analysis , especially modular forms . The lower half-plane, defined by y  n , the maximally symmetric, simply connected , n -dimensional Riemannian manifold with constant sectional curvature −1. In this terminology, the upper half-plane is H 2 since it has real  dimension 2.  In number theory , the theory of Hilbert modular forms is concerned with the study of certain functions on the direct product H n of n copies of the upper half-plane. Yet another space interesting to number theorists is the Siegel upper half-space  H n , which is the domain of Siegel modular forms .
