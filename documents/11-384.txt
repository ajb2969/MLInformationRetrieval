   Proteasome ATPase      Proteasome ATPase   In enzymology , a proteasome ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and H 2 O , whereas its two products are ADP and phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to facilitate cellular and subcellular movement. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (polypeptide-degrading) .  References      "  Category:EC 3.6.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
