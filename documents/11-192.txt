D-fuconate dehydratase




D-fuconate dehydratase

In enzymology, a D-fuconate dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

D-fuconate 
 
 
 
  2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-fuconate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, D-fuconate, and two products, 2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-fuconate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is D-fuconate hydro-lyase (2-dehydro-3-deoxy-D-fuconate-forming). This enzyme is also called D-fuconate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
