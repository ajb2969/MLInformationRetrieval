2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate N-succinyltransferase

In enzymology, a 2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate N-succinyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

succinyl-CoA + (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate + H2O 
 
 
 
  CoA + N-succinyl-L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are succinyl-CoA, (S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate, and H2O, whereas its two products are CoA and N-succinyl-L-2-amino-6-oxoheptanedioate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is succinyl-CoA:(S)-2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate N-succinyltransferase. Other names in common use include tetrahydropicolinate succinylase, tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase, tetrahydrodipicolinate succinyltransferase, succinyl-CoA:tetrahydrodipicolinate N-succinyltransferase, succinyl-CoA:2,3,4,5-tetrahydropyridine-2,6-dicarboxylate, and N-succinyltransferase. This enzyme participates in lysine biosynthesis.
