   Invariant manifold      Invariant manifold   In dynamical systems , a branch of mathematics , an invariant manifold is a topological manifold that is invariant under the action of the dynamical system. 1 Examples include the slow manifold , center manifold , stable manifold , unstable manifold, subcenter manifold and inertial manifold .  Typically, although by no means always, invariant manifolds are constructed as a 'perturbation' of an invariant subspace about an equilibrium. In dissipative systems, an invariant manifold based upon the gravest, longest lasting modes forms an effective low-dimensional, reduced, model of the dynamics. 2  Definition  Consider the differential equation          d  x   /  d   t   =   f   (  x  )     ,   x  ∈   ℝ  n     ,     formulae-sequence          d  x   d   t     f  x      x   superscript  ℝ  n      dx/dt=f(x),\ x\in\mathbb{R}^{n},   with flow     x   (  t  )    =    ϕ  t    (   x  0   )          x  t      subscript  ϕ  t    subscript  x  0      x(t)=\phi_{t}(x_{0})   being the solution of the differential equation with     x   (  0  )    =   x  0         x  0    subscript  x  0     x(0)=x_{0}   . A set    S  ⊂   ℝ  n       S   superscript  ℝ  n     S\subset\mathbb{R}^{n}   is called an invariant set for the differential equation if, for each     x  0   ∈  S       subscript  x  0   S    x_{0}\in S   , the solution    t  ↦    ϕ  t    (   x  0   )       maps-to  t     subscript  ϕ  t    subscript  x  0      t\mapsto\phi_{t}(x_{0})   , defined on its maximal interval of existence, has its image in   S   S   S   . Alternatively, the orbit passing through each     x  0   ∈  S       subscript  x  0   S    x_{0}\in S   lies in   S   S   S   . In addition,   S   S   S   is called an invariant manifold if   S   S   S   is a manifold . 3  Examples  Simple 2D dynamical system  For any fixed parameter   a   a   a   , consider the variables     x   (  t  )    ,   y   (  t  )         x  t     y  t     x(t),y(t)   governed by the pair of coupled differential equations           d  x   /  d   t   =     a  x   -   x  y    and        d  y   /  d   t   =     -  y   +   x  2    -   2   y  2       .     formulae-sequence          d  x   d   t        a  x     x  y    and            d  y   d   t         y    superscript  x  2      2   superscript  y  2        dx/dt=ax-xy\quad\text{and}\quad dy/dt=-y+x^{2}-2y^{2}.   The origin is an equilibrium. This system has two invariant manifolds of interest through the origin.   The vertical line    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   is invariant as when    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   the   x   x   x   -equation becomes       d  x   /  d   t   =  0            d  x   d   t   0    dx/dt=0   which ensures   x   x   x   remains zero. This invariant manifold,    x  =  0      x  0    x=0   , is a stable manifold of the origin (when    a  ≥  0      a  0    a\geq 0   ) as all initial conditions      x   (  0  )    =  0   ,    y   (  0  )    >   -   1  /  2        formulae-sequence      x  0   0       y  0       1  2       x(0)=0,\ y(0)>-1/2   lead to solutions asymptotically approaching the origin.  The parabola    y  =    x  2   /   (   1  +   2  a    )        y     superscript  x  2     1    2  a       y=x^{2}/(1+2a)   is invariant for all parameter   a   a   a   . One can see this invariance by considering the time derivative     d  /  d   t   [   y  -    x  2   /   (   1  +   2  a    )     ]         d  d   t   delimited-[]    y     superscript  x  2     1    2  a         d/dt[y-x^{2}/(1+2a)]   and finding it is zero on    y  =    x  2   /   (   1  +   2  a    )        y     superscript  x  2     1    2  a       y=x^{2}/(1+2a)   as required for an invariant manifold. For    a  >  0      a  0    a>0   this parabola is the unstable manifold of the origin. For    a  =  0      a  0    a=0   this parabola is a center manifold , more precisely a slow manifold , of the origin.  For    a  <  0      a  0    a<0   there is only an invariant stable manifold about the origin, the stable manifold including all      (  x  ,  y  )   ,  y   >   -   1  /  2          x  y   y       1  2      (x,y),\ y>-1/2   .
