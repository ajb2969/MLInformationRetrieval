6-carboxytetrahydropterin synthase

6-carboxytetrahydropterin synthase (, CPH4 synthase, queD (gene), ToyB, ykvK (gene)) is an enzyme with system name 7,8-dihydroneopterin 3'-triphosphate acetaldehyde-lyase (6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin and triphosphate-forming).12 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

7,8-dihydroneopterin 3'-triphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  6-carboxy-5,6,7,8-tetrahydropterin + acetaldehyde + triphosphate


This enzyme binds Zn2+.
