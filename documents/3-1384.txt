   Zariski tangent space      Zariski tangent space   In algebraic geometry , the Zariski tangent space is a construction that defines a tangent space at a point P on an algebraic variety  V (and more generally). It does not use differential calculus , being based directly on abstract algebra , and in the most concrete cases just the theory of a system of linear equations .  Motivation  For example, suppose given a plane curve  C defined by a polynomial equation   F(X,Y) = 0    and take P to be the origin (0,0). Erasing terms of higher order than 1 would produce a 'linearised' equation reading   L(X,Y) = 0    in which all terms ''X a Y b'' have been discarded if a + b > 1 .  We have two cases: L may be 0, or it may be the equation of a line. In the first case the (Zariski) tangent space to C at (0,0) is the whole plane, considered as a two-dimensional affine space . In the second case, the tangent space is that line, considered as affine space. (The question of the origin comes up, when we take P as a general point on C ; it is better to say 'affine space' and then note that P is a natural origin, rather than insist directly that it is a vector space .)  It is easy to see that over the real field we can obtain L in terms of the first partial derivatives of F . When those both are 0 at P , we have a singular point ( double point , cusp or something more complicated). The general definition is that singular points of C are the cases when the tangent space has dimension 2.  Definition  The cotangent space of a local ring  R , with maximal ideal    𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}   is defined to be      𝔪  /   𝔪  2       𝔪   superscript  𝔪  2     \mathfrak{m}/\mathfrak{m}^{2}   where   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}    2 is given by the product of ideals . It is a vector space over the residue field  k := R/   𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}    . Its dual (as a k -vector space) is called tangent space of R . 1  This definition is a generalization of the above example to higher dimensions: suppose given an affine algebraic variety V and a point v of V . Morally, modding out    𝔪   𝔪   \mathfrak{m}    2 corresponds to dropping the non-linear terms from the equations defining V inside some affine space, therefore giving a system of linear equations that define the tangent space.  The tangent space     T  P    (  X  )        subscript  T  P   X    T_{P}(X)   and cotangent space     T  P  *    (  X  )        superscript   subscript  T  P     X    T_{P}^{*}(X)   to a scheme X at a point P is the (co)tangent space of    𝒪   X  ,  P      subscript  𝒪   X  P     \mathcal{O}_{X,P}   . Due to the functoriality of Spec , the natural quotient map    f  :   R  →   R  /  I       normal-:  f   normal-→  R    R  I      f:R\rightarrow R/I   induces a homomorphism    g  :    𝒪   X  ,    f   -  1     (  P  )      →   𝒪   Y  ,  P        normal-:  g   normal-→   subscript  𝒪   X     superscript  f    1    P      subscript  𝒪   Y  P       g:\mathcal{O}_{X,f^{-1}(P)}\rightarrow\mathcal{O}_{Y,P}   for X =Spec( R ), P a point in Y =Spec( R/I ). This is used to embed     T  P    (  Y  )        subscript  T  P   Y    T_{P}(Y)   in     T    f   -  1    P     (  X  )        subscript  T     superscript  f    1    P    X    T_{f^{-1}P}(X)   . 2 Since morphisms of fields are injective, the surjection of the residue fields induced by g is an isomorphism. Then a morphism k of the cotangent spaces is induced by g , given by       𝔪  P   /   𝔪  P  2        subscript  𝔪  P    superscript   subscript  𝔪  P   2     \mathfrak{m}_{P}/\mathfrak{m}_{P}^{2}          ≅    (    𝔪    f   -  1    P    /  I   )   /   (    (    𝔪    f   -  1    P   2   +  I   )   /  I   )        absent       subscript  𝔪     superscript  f    1    P    I        superscript   subscript  𝔪     superscript  f    1    P    2   I   I      \cong(\mathfrak{m}_{f^{-1}P}/I)/((\mathfrak{m}_{f^{-1}P}^{2}+I)/I)          ≅    𝔪    f   -  1    P    /   (    𝔪    f   -  1    P   2   +  I   )        absent     subscript  𝔪     superscript  f    1    P       superscript   subscript  𝔪     superscript  f    1    P    2   I      \cong\mathfrak{m}_{f^{-1}P}/(\mathfrak{m}_{f^{-1}P}^{2}+I)           ≅     (    𝔪    f   -  1    P    /   𝔪    f   -  1    P   2    )   /  Ker    (  k  )     .      absent         subscript  𝔪     superscript  f    1    P     superscript   subscript  𝔪     superscript  f    1    P    2    Ker   k     \cong(\mathfrak{m}_{f^{-1}P}/\mathfrak{m}_{f^{-1}P}^{2})/\mathrm{Ker}(k).     Since this is a surjection, the transpose      k  *   :     T  P    (  Y  )    →    T    f   -  1    P     (  X  )        normal-:   superscript  k     normal-→     subscript  T  P   Y      subscript  T     superscript  f    1    P    X      k^{*}:T_{P}(Y)\rightarrow T_{f^{-1}P}(X)   is an injection.  (One often defines the tangent and cotangent spaces for a manifold in the analogous manner.)  Analytic functions  If V is a subvariety of an n -dimensional vector space, defined by an ideal I , then R = F n /I , where F n is the ring of smooth/analytic/holomorphic functions on this vector space. The Zariski tangent space at x is   ''m n / ( I+m n 2 ),   where m n is the maximal ideal consisting of those functions in F n vanishing at x .  In the planar example above, I = , and ''I+m 2 = +m 2 .  Properties  If R is a Noetherian local ring, the dimension of the tangent space is at least the dimension of R :   dim m/m 2 ≧ dim R    R is called regular if equality holds. In a more geometric parlance, when R is the local ring of a variety V in v , one also says that v is a regular point. Otherwise it is called a singular point .  The tangent space has an interpretation in terms of homomorphisms to the dual numbers for K ,   K[t]/t 2 :   in the parlance of schemes , morphisms Spec K[t]/t 2 to a scheme X over K correspond to a choice of a rational point  x ∈ X(k) and an element of the tangent space at x . 3 Therefore, one also talks about tangent vectors .
