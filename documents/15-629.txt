   Mean-periodic function      Mean-periodic function   In mathematical analysis , the concept of a mean-periodic function is a generalization introduced by Jean Delsarte , of the concept of a periodic function . 1  Consider a complex -valued function ƒ of a real variable. The function ƒ is periodic with period a precisely if for all real x , we have ƒ ( x ) − ƒ ( x − a ) = 0. This can be written as       ∫   f   (   x  -  y   )   d  μ   (  y  )     =   0   (  1  )            f    x  y   d  μ  y     0  1     \int f(x-y)\,d\mu(y)=0\qquad\qquad(1)     where   μ   μ   \mu   is the difference between the Dirac measures at 0 and a . A mean-periodic function is a function ƒ satisfying (1) for some nonzero measure   μ   μ   \mu   with compact (hence bounded) support.  External links   Lectures on Mean Periodic Functions, by J. P.
