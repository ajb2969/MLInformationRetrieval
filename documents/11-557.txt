Sorbitol-6-phosphatase

In enzymology, a sorbitol-6-phosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

sorbitol 6-phosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  sorbitol + phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are sorbitol 6-phosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are sorbitol and phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on phosphoric monoester bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is sorbitol-6-phosphate phosphohydrolase. This enzyme is also called sorbitol-6-phosphate phosphatase.
