   Fundamental class      Fundamental class   In mathematics , the fundamental class is a homology class [ M ] associated to an oriented  manifold  M , which corresponds to the generator of the homology group      H  r    (  M  ;  𝐙  )    ≅  𝐙         subscript  H  r    M  𝐙    𝐙    H_{r}(M;\mathbf{Z})\cong\mathbf{Z}   . The fundamental class can be thought of as the orientation of the top-dimensional simplices of a suitable triangulation of the manifold.  Definition  Closed, orientable  When M is a connected  orientable  closed manifold of dimension n , the top homology group is infinite cyclic       H  n    (  M  ,  𝐙  )    ≅  𝐙         subscript  H  n    M  𝐙    𝐙    H_{n}(M,\mathbf{Z})\cong\mathbf{Z}   , and an orientation is a choice of generator, a choice of isomorphism    𝐙  →    H  n    (  M  ,  𝐙  )       normal-→  𝐙     subscript  H  n    M  𝐙      \mathbf{Z}\to H_{n}(M,\mathbf{Z})   . The generator is called the fundamental class .  If M is disconnected (but still orientable), a fundamental class is the direct sum of the fundamental classes for each connected component (corresponding to an orientation for each component).  In relation with de Rham cohomology It represents a integration over M ; namely for M a smooth manifold, an n -form ω can be paired with the fundamental class as        ⟨  ω  ,   [  M  ]   ⟩   =    ∫  M    ω     ,       ω   delimited-[]  M      subscript   M   ω     \langle\omega,[M]\rangle=\int_{M}\omega\ ,     which is the integral of ω over M , and depends only on the cohomology class of ω.  Stiefel-Whitney class  If M is not orientable, the homology group is not infinite cyclic      H  n    (  M  ,  𝐙  )    ≇  𝐙           subscript  H  n    M  𝐙    𝐙     H_{n}(M,\mathbf{Z})\ncong\mathbf{Z}   , one cannot define a orientation of M , Indeed, one cannot integrate differential n -forms over non-orientable manifolds.  However, every closed manifold is    𝐙  2     subscript  𝐙  2    \mathbf{Z}_{2}   -orientable, and      H  n    (  M  ;   𝐙  2   )    =   𝐙  2          subscript  H  n    M   subscript  𝐙  2      subscript  𝐙  2     H_{n}(M;\mathbf{Z}_{2})=\mathbf{Z}_{2}   (for M connected). Thus every closed manifold is    𝐙  2     subscript  𝐙  2    \mathbf{Z}_{2}   -oriented (not just orient able : there is no ambiguity in choice of orientation), and has a    𝐙  2     subscript  𝐙  2    \mathbf{Z}_{2}   -fundamental class.  This    𝐙  2     subscript  𝐙  2    \mathbf{Z}_{2}   -fundamental class is used in defining Stiefel–Whitney class .  With boundary  If M is a compact orientable manifold with boundary, then the top relative homology group is again infinite cyclic      H  n    (  M  ,   ∂  M   )    ≅  𝐙         subscript  H  n    M    M     𝐙    H_{n}(M,\partial M)\cong\mathbf{Z}   , and the notion of the fundamental class is extended to the relative case.  Poincaré duality  For any abelian group   G   G   G   and non negative integer    q  ≥  0      q  0    q\geq 0   one can obtain an isomorphism        [  M  ]   ∩   :     H  q    (  M  ;  G  )    →    H   n  -  q     (  M  ;  G  )        normal-:   limit-from   delimited-[]  M      normal-→     superscript  H  q    M  G       subscript  H    n  q     M  G       [M]\cap:H^{q}(M;G)\rightarrow H_{n-q}(M;G)   . using the cap product of the fundamental class and the   q   q   q   -homology group . This isomorphism gives Poincaré duality:        H  *    (  M  ;  G  )    ≅    H    n  -   *     (  M  ;  G  )           superscript  H     M  G       subscript  H    limit-from  n        M  G      H^{*}(M;G)\cong H_{n-*}(M;G)   .
