   Cytochrome-c3 hydrogenase      Cytochrome-c3 hydrogenase   In enzymology , a cytochrome-c3 hydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   2 H 2 + ferricytochrome c 3    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4 H + + ferrocytochrome c 3    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are H 2 and ferricytochrome c3 , whereas its two products are H + and ferrocytochrome c3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on hydrogen as donor with a cytochrome as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogen:ferricytochrome-c3 oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include H2:ferricytochrome c3 oxidoreductase , cytochrome c3 reductase , cytochrome hydrogenase , and hydrogenase [ambiguous] . It has 3 cofactors : iron , Nickel , and Iron-sulfur .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 19 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .
