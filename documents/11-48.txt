   Asparaginyl-tRNA synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)      Asparaginyl-tRNA synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing)   In enzymology , an asparaginyl-tRNA synthase (glutamine-hydrolysing) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + aspartyl-tRNAAsn + L-glutamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + asparaginyl-tRNAAsn + L-glutamate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , aspartyl-tRNA(Asn) , and L-glutamine , whereas its 4 products are ADP , phosphate , asparaginyl-tRNA(Asn) , and L-glutamate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming carbon-nitrogen bonds carbon-nitrogen ligases with glutamine as amido-N-donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is aspartyl-tRNAAsn:L-glutamine amido-ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include Asp-AdT , Asp-tRNAAsn amidotransferase , aspartyl-tRNAAsn amidotransferase , and Asn-tRNAAsn:L-glutamine amido-ligase (ADP-forming) . This enzyme participates in glutamate metabolism and alanine and aspartate metabolism .  References       "  Category:EC 6.3.5  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
