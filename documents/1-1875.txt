Irreducible element

In abstract algebra, a non-zero non-unit element in an integral domain is said to be irreducible if it is not a product of two non-units.
Relationship with prime elements
Irreducible elements should not be confused with prime elements. (A non-zero non-unit element 
 
 
 
  in a commutative ring

 
  is called prime if, whenever 
 
 
 
  for some 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
  In an integral domain, every prime element is irreducible,12 but the converse is not true in general. The converse is true for unique factorization domains3 (or, more generally, GCD domains.)
Moreover, while an ideal generated by a prime element is a prime ideal, it is not true in general that an ideal generated by an irreducible element is an irreducible ideal. However, if 
 
 
 
  is a GCD domain, and 
 
 
 
  is an irreducible element of 
 
 
 
 , then the ideal generated by 
 
 
is a prime ideal of 
 
 
 
 .4
Example
In the quadratic integer ring

 
  it can be shown using norm arguments that the number 3 is irreducible. However, it is not a prime element in this ring since, for example,



but 
 
 
 
  does not divide either of the two factors.5
