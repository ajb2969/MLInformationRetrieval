Nuatigenin 3beta-glucosyltransferase

In enzymology, a nuatigenin 3beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

UDP-glucose + (20S,22S,25S)-22,25-epoxyfurost-5-ene-3beta,26-diol 
 
 
 
  UDP + (20S,22S,25S)-22,25-epoxyfurost-5-ene-3beta,26-diol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and (20S,22S,25S)-22,25-epoxyfurost-5-ene-3beta,26-diol, whereas its 3 products are UDP, (20S,22S,25S)-22,25-epoxyfurost-5-ene-3beta,26-diol, and 3-O-beta-D-glucoside.
This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases, specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:(20S,22S,25S)-22,25-epoxyfurost-5-ene-3beta,26-diol 3-O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase. This enzyme is also called uridine diphosphoglucose-nuatigenin glucosyltransferase.
