   Löb's theorem      Löb's theorem   In mathematical logic , Löb's theorem states that in a theory with Peano arithmetic , for any formula P , if it is provable that "if P is provable then P is true", then P is provable. I.e.       if   P  A  ⊢   (  B  e  w   (  #  P  )   →  P  )   ,   then   P  A  ⊢  P     fragments  if  P  A  proves   fragments  normal-(  B  e  w   fragments  normal-(  #  P  normal-)   normal-→  P  normal-)   normal-,  then  P  A  proves  P    \mathrm{if}\ PA\vdash(Bew(\#P)\rightarrow P)\mathrm{,then}\ PA\vdash P     where Bew (# P ) means that the formula P with Gödel number # P is provable.  Löb's theorem is named for Martin Hugo Löb , who formulated it in 1955.  Löb's theorem in provability logic  Provability logic abstracts away from the details of encodings used in Gödel's incompleteness theorems by expressing the provability of   ϕ   ϕ   \phi   in the given system in the language of modal logic , by means of the modality .  Then we can formalize Löb's theorem by the axiom      □   (  □  P  →  P  )   →  □  P  ,     fragments  □   fragments  normal-(  □  P  normal-→  P  normal-)   normal-→  □  P  normal-,    \Box(\Box P\rightarrow P)\rightarrow\Box P,     known as axiom GL, for Gödel-Löb. This is sometimes formalised by means of an inference rule that infers     P   P   P     from        □  P   →  P   .     normal-→    normal-□  P   P    \Box P\rightarrow P.     The provability logic GL that results from taking the modal logic  K4 (or K , since the axiom schema 4 ,     □  A   →   □  □  A      normal-→    normal-□  A     normal-□  normal-□  A     \Box A\rightarrow\Box\Box A   , then becomes redundant) and adding the above axiom GL is the most intensely investigated system in provability logic.  Modal Proof of Löb's theorem  Löb's theorem can be proved within modal logic using only some basic rules about the provability operator (the K4 system) plus the existence of modal fixed points.  Modal Formulas  We will assume the following grammar for formulas:   If   X   X   X   is a propositional variable , then   X   X   X   is a formula.  If   K   K   K   is a propositional constant, then   K   K   K   is a formula.  If   A   A   A   is a formula, then    □  A      normal-□  A    \Box A   is a formula.  If   A   A   A   and   B   B   B   are formulas, then so are    ¬  A       A    \neg A   ,    A  →  B     normal-→  A  B    A\rightarrow B   ,    A  ∧  B      A  B    A\wedge B   ,    A  ∨  B      A  B    A\vee B   , and    A  ↔  B     normal-↔  A  B    A\leftrightarrow B      A modal sentence is a modal formula that contains no propositional variables. We use     ⊢  A     proves  absent  A    \vdash A   to mean   A   A   A   is a theorem.  Modal Fixed Points  If    F   (  X  )       F  X    F(X)   is a modal formula with only one propositional variable   X   X   X   , then a modal fixed point of    F   (  X  )       F  X    F(X)   is a sentence   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   such that      ⊢  Ψ  ↔  F   (  □  Ψ  )      fragments  proves  Ψ  normal-↔  F   fragments  normal-(  □  Ψ  normal-)     \vdash\Psi\leftrightarrow F(\Box\Psi)     We will assume the existence of such fixed points for every modal formula with one free variable. This is of course not an obvious thing to assume, but if we interpret   □   normal-□   \Box   as provability in Peano Arithmetic, then the existence of modal fixed points is in fact true.  Modal Rules of Inference  In addition to the existence of modal fixed points, we assume the following rules of inference for the provability operator   □   normal-□   \Box   :   From     ⊢  A     proves  absent  A    \vdash A   conclude     ⊢   □  A      proves  absent    normal-□  A     \vdash\Box A   : Informally, this says that if A is a theorem, then it is provable.       ⊢    □  A   →   □  □  A       proves  absent   normal-→    normal-□  A     normal-□  normal-□  A      \vdash\Box A\rightarrow\Box\Box A   : If A is provable, then it is provable that it is provable.      ⊢  □   (  A  →  B  )   →   (  □  A  →  □  B  )      fragments  proves  □   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-→  B  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  □  A  normal-→  □  B  normal-)     \vdash\Box(A\rightarrow B)\rightarrow(\Box A\rightarrow\Box B)   : This rule allows you to do modus ponens inside the provability operator. If it is provable that A implies B, and A is provable, then B is provable.   Proof of Löb's theorem   Assume that there is a modal sentence   P   P   P   such that     ⊢    □  P   →  P      proves  absent   normal-→    normal-□  P   P     \vdash\Box P\rightarrow P   . Roughly speaking, it is a theorem that if   P   P   P   is provable, then it is, in fact true. This is a claim of soundness .  From the existence of modal fixed points for every formula (in particular, the formula    X  →  P     normal-→  X  P    X\rightarrow P   ) it follows there exists a sentence   Ψ   normal-Ψ   \Psi   such that    ⊢  Ψ  ↔   (  □  Ψ  →  P  )      fragments  proves  Ψ  normal-↔   fragments  normal-(  □  Ψ  normal-→  P  normal-)     \vdash\Psi\leftrightarrow(\Box\Psi\rightarrow P)   .  From 2, it follows that    ⊢  Ψ  →   (  □  Ψ  →  P  )      fragments  proves  Ψ  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  □  Ψ  normal-→  P  normal-)     \vdash\Psi\rightarrow(\Box\Psi\rightarrow P)   .  From rule of inference 1, it follows that    ⊢  □   (  Ψ  →   (  □  Ψ  →  P  )   )      fragments  proves  □   fragments  normal-(  Ψ  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  □  Ψ  normal-→  P  normal-)   normal-)     \vdash\Box(\Psi\rightarrow(\Box\Psi\rightarrow P))   .  From 4 and rule of inference 3, it follows that    ⊢  □  Ψ  →  □   (  □  Ψ  →  P  )      fragments  proves  □  Ψ  normal-→  □   fragments  normal-(  □  Ψ  normal-→  P  normal-)     \vdash\Box\Psi\rightarrow\Box(\Box\Psi\rightarrow P)   .  Substituting    A  =   □  Ψ       A    normal-□  normal-Ψ     A=\Box\Psi   and    B  =  P      B  P    B=P   in rule of inference 3 gives us    ⊢  □   (  □  Ψ  →  P  )   →   (  □  □  Ψ  →  □  P  )      fragments  proves  □   fragments  normal-(  □  Ψ  normal-→  P  normal-)   normal-→   fragments  normal-(  □  □  Ψ  normal-→  □  P  normal-)     \vdash\Box(\Box\Psi\rightarrow P)\rightarrow(\Box\Box\Psi\rightarrow\Box P)   .  From 5 and 6, it follows that    ⊢  □  Ψ  →   (  □  □  Ψ  →  □  P  )      fragments  proves  □  Ψ  normal-→   fragments  normal-(  □  □  Ψ  normal-→  □  P  normal-)     \vdash\Box\Psi\rightarrow(\Box\Box\Psi\rightarrow\Box P)   .  From rule of inference 2, it follows that     ⊢    □  Ψ   →   □  □  Ψ       proves  absent   normal-→    normal-□  normal-Ψ     normal-□  normal-□  normal-Ψ      \vdash\Box\Psi\rightarrow\Box\Box\Psi   .  From 7 and 8, it follows that     ⊢    □  Ψ   →   □  P       proves  absent   normal-→    normal-□  normal-Ψ     normal-□  P      \vdash\Box\Psi\rightarrow\Box P   .  From 1 and 9, it follows that     ⊢    □  Ψ   →  P      proves  absent   normal-→    normal-□  normal-Ψ   P     \vdash\Box\Psi\rightarrow P   .  From 2, it follows that    ⊢   (  □  Ψ  →  P  )   →  Ψ     fragments  proves   fragments  normal-(  □  Ψ  normal-→  P  normal-)   normal-→  Ψ    \vdash(\Box\Psi\rightarrow P)\rightarrow\Psi   .  From 10 and 11, it follows that     ⊢  Ψ     proves  absent  normal-Ψ    \vdash\Psi     From 12 and rule of inference 1, it follows that     ⊢   □  Ψ      proves  absent    normal-□  normal-Ψ     \vdash\Box\Psi   .  From 13 and 10, it follows that     ⊢  P     proves  absent  P    \vdash P   .   More on the existence of modal fixed points  Not only does the existence of modal fixed points imply Löb's theorem, but the converse is valid, too. When Löb's theorem is given as an axiom (schema), the existence of a fixed point (up to provable equivalence)    p  ↔   A   (  p  )       normal-↔  p    A  p     p\leftrightarrow A(p)   for any formula A ( p )'' modalized in p'' can be derived. 1 Thus in normal modal logic , Löb's axiom is equivalent to the conjunction of the axiom schema 4 ,    (  □  A  →  □  □  A  ,  )     fragments  normal-(  □  A  normal-→  □  □  A  normal-,  normal-)    (\Box A\rightarrow\Box\Box A,)   and the existence of modal fixed points.
