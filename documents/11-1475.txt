   Dolichyl-diphosphate—polyphosphate phosphotransferase      Dolichyl-diphosphate—polyphosphate phosphotransferase   In enzymology , a dolichyl-diphosphate-polyphosphate phosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   dolichyl diphosphate + (phosphate)n   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   dolichyl phosphate + (phosphate)n + 1   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are dolichyl diphosphate and (phosphate)n , whereas its two products are dolichyl phosphate and (phosphate)n+1 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with a phosphate group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is dolichyl-diphosphate:polyphosphate phosphotransferase . This enzyme is also called dolichylpyrophosphate:polyphosphate phosphotransferase .
