   Holonomic basis      Holonomic basis   In mathematics and mathematical physics , a holonomic basis or coordinate basis for a differentiable manifold is a set of basis  vector fields { e k } such that some  coordinate system { x k } exists for which        e  k   =   ∂   ∂   x  k      .       subscript  e  k         superscript  x  k       e_{k}={\partial\over\partial x^{k}}.   A local condition for a basis { e k } to be holonomic is that all mutual Lie derivatives vanish: 1       [   e  i   ,   e  j   ]   =  0.        subscript  e  i    subscript  e  j    0.    [e_{i},e_{j}]=0.     A basis that is not holonomic is called a non-holonomic or non-coordinate basis.
