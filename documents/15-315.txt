Holonomic basis

In mathematics and mathematical physics, a holonomic basis or coordinate basis for a differentiable manifold is a set of basis vector fields {ek} such that some coordinate system {xk} exists for which


 
  A local condition for a basis {ek} to be holonomic is that all mutual Lie derivatives vanish:1



A basis that is not holonomic is called a non-holonomic or non-coordinate basis.
