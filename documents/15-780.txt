3(or 17)a-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase

3(or 17)alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (, 3(17)alpha-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase) is an enzyme with system name 3(or 17)alpha-hydroxysteroid:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase.12 This enzyme catalyses the chemical reaction

androsterone + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  5alpha-androstane-3,17-dione + NAD(P)H + H+


This enzyme acts on the 3alpha-hydroxy group of androgens of the 5alpha-androstane series; and also, more slowly, on the 17alpha-hydroxy group of both androgenic and estrogenic substrates (cf. EC 1.1.1.51 3(or 17)beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase).
