   Butanal dehydrogenase      Butanal dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a butanal dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   butanal + CoA + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   butanoyl-CoA + NAD(P)H + H +    The 4 substrates of this enzyme are butanal , CoA , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are butanoyl-CoA , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the aldehyde or oxo group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is butanal:NAD(P)+ oxidoreductase (CoA-acylating) . This enzyme participates in butanoate metabolism .
