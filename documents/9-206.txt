List of area moments of inertia

The following is a list of area moments of inertia. The Area Moment of Inertia or second moment of area has a unit of dimension length4, and should not be confused with the mass moment of inertia. If the piece is thin, however, the mass moment of inertia equals the area density times the area moment of inertia. Each is with respect to a horizontal axis through the centroid of the given shape, unless otherwise specified.

This can be used to determine the second moment of area of a rigid body about any axis, given the body's moment of inertia about a parallel axis through the object's center of mass and the perpendicular distance (r) between the axes.
