   Kosmotropic      Kosmotropic   Co-solvents (in water solvent ) are defined as kosmotropic (order-making) if they contribute to the stability and structure of water-water interactions. Kosmotropes cause water molecules to favorably interact, which also (in effect) stabilizes intramolecular interactions in macromolecules such as proteins . 1  Chaotropic agents (disorder-makers) have the opposite effect, disrupting water structure, increasing the solubility of nonpolar solvent particles, and destabilizing solute aggregates. 2  Ionic Kosmotropes  Ionic kosmotropes tend to be small or have high charge density. Some ionic kosmotropes are , , , magnesium (2+), lithium (1+), zinc (2+) and aluminium (+3). Large ions or ions with low charge density (such as bromide , iodide , potassium (1+), caesium (1+)) instead act as chaotropes . 3 Kosmotropic anions are more polarizable and hydrate more strongly than kosmotropic cations of the same charge density. 4  A scale can be established if one refers to the Hofmeister series or looks up the free energy of hydrogen bonding (    Δ   G  HB       normal-Δ   subscript  G  HB     \Delta G_{\rm HB}   ) of the salts, which quantifies the extent of hydrogen bonding of an ion in water. 5 For example, the kosmotropes and have    Δ   G  HB       normal-Δ   subscript  G  HB     \Delta G_{\rm HB}   between 0.1 and 0.4 J/mol , whereas the chaotrope has a    Δ   G  HB       normal-Δ   subscript  G  HB     \Delta G_{\rm HB}   between −1.1 to −0.9. 6  Applications  Ammonium sulfate is the traditional kosmotropic salt for the salting out of protein from an aqueous solution. Kosmotropes are used to induce protein aggregation in pharmaceutical preparation and at various stages of protein extraction and purification.  Nonionic Kosmotropes  Nonionic kosmotropes have no net charge but are very soluble and become very hydrated. Carbohydrates such as trehalose and glucose as well as proline and tert -butanol are kosmotropes.
