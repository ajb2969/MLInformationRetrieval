   Quinine 3-monooxygenase      Quinine 3-monooxygenase   In enzymology , a quinine 3-monooxygenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   quinine + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-hydroxyquinine + NADP + + H 2 O   The 4 substrates of this enzyme are quinine , NADPH , H + , and O 2 , whereas its 3 products are 3-hydroxyquinine , NADP + , and H 2 O .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on paired donors, with O2 as oxidant and incorporation or reduction of oxygen. The oxygen incorporated need not be derived from O2 with NADH or NADPH as one donor, and incorporation of one atom o oxygen into the other donor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is quinine,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called quinine 3-hydroxylase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 5 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , and .
