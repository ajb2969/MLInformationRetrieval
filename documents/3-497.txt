   One-sided limit      One-sided limit   In calculus , a one-sided limit is either of the two limits of a function  f ( x ) of a real variable x as x approaches a specified point either from below or from above. One should write either:       lim   x  →   a  +      f   (  x  )        subscript    normal-→  x   superscript  a        f  x     \lim_{x\to a^{+}}f(x)   or      lim   x  ↓  a      f   (  x  )        subscript    normal-↓  x  a      f  x     \lim_{x\downarrow a}\,f(x)   or      lim   x  ↘  a      f   (  x  )        subscript    normal-↘  x  a      f  x     \lim_{x\searrow a}\,f(x)   or     lim   x   →  >   a     f   (  x  )        subscript     x    normal-→   a      f  x     \lim_{x\underset{>}{\to}a}f(x)     for the limit as x decreases in value approaching a ( x approaches a "from the right" or "from above"), and similarly       lim   x  →   a  -      f   (  x  )        subscript    normal-→  x   superscript  a        f  x     \lim_{x\to a^{-}}f(x)   or      lim   x  ↑  a      f   (  x  )        subscript    normal-↑  x  a      f  x     \lim_{x\uparrow a}\,f(x)   or      lim   x  ↗  a      f   (  x  )        subscript    normal-↗  x  a      f  x     \lim_{x\nearrow a}\,f(x)   or     lim   x   →  <   a     f   (  x  )        subscript     x    normal-→   a      f  x     \lim_{x\underset{<}{\to}a}f(x)     for the limit as x increases in value approaching a ( x approaches a "from the left" or "from below")  The two one-sided limits exist and are equal if the limit of f ( x ) as x approaches a exists. In some cases in which the limit       lim   x  →  a     f   (  x  )        subscript    normal-→  x  a      f  x     \lim_{x\to a}f(x)\,     does not exist, the two one-sided limits nonetheless exist. Consequently, the limit as x approaches a is sometimes called a "two-sided limit". In some cases one of the two one-sided limits exists and the other does not, and in some cases neither exists.  The right-sided limit can be rigorously defined as:      ∀  ε  >   0   ∃  δ  >   0   ∀  x  ∈   I    (  0  <  x  -  a  <  δ  ⇒  |  f   (  x  )   -  L  |  <  ε  )      fragments  for-all  ε   0   δ   0  for-all  x   I   fragments  normal-(  0   x   a   δ  normal-⇒  normal-|  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    L  normal-|   ε  normal-)     \forall\varepsilon>0\;\exists\delta>0\;\forall x\in I\;(0     Similarly, the left-sided limit can be rigorously defined as:      ∀  ε  >   0   ∃  δ  >   0   ∀  x  ∈   I    (  0  <  a  -  x  <  δ  ⇒  |  f   (  x  )   -  L  |  <  ε  )      fragments  for-all  ε   0   δ   0  for-all  x   I   fragments  normal-(  0   a   x   δ  normal-⇒  normal-|  f   fragments  normal-(  x  normal-)    L  normal-|   ε  normal-)     \forall\varepsilon>0\;\exists\delta>0\;\forall x\in I\;(0     Where   I   I   I   represents some interval that is within the domain of   f   f   f     Examples  One example of a function with different one-sided limits is the following:         lim   x  →   0  +      1   1  +   2   -   1  /  x        =  1   ,        subscript    normal-→  x   superscript  0        1    1   superscript  2      1  x        1    \lim_{x\to 0^{+}}{1\over 1+2^{-1/x}}=1,     whereas        lim   x  →   0  -      1   1  +   2   -   1  /  x        =  0.        subscript    normal-→  x   superscript  0        1    1   superscript  2      1  x        0.    \lim_{x\to 0^{-}}{1\over 1+2^{-1/x}}=0.     Relation to topological definition of limit  The one-sided limit to a point p corresponds to the general definition of limit , with the domain of the function restricted to one side, by either allowing that the function domain is a subset of the topological space, or by considering a one-sided subspace, including p . Alternatively, one may consider the domain with a half-open interval topology .  Abel's theorem  A noteworthy theorem treating one-sided limits of certain power series at the boundaries of their intervals of convergence is Abel's theorem .
