Polar topology

In functional analysis and related areas of mathematics a polar topology, topology of 
 
 
 
 -convergence or topology of uniform convergence on the sets of

 
  is a method to define locally convex topologies on the vector spaces of a dual pair.
Definitions
Let 
 
 
 
  be a dual pair

 
  of vector spaces

 
  and 
 
 
 
  over the (same) field 
 
 
 
  of real or complex numbers.
A set 
 
 
 
  is said to be bounded in 
 
 
 
  with respect to 
 
 
 
 , if for each element 
 
 
 
  the set of values 
 
 
 
  is bounded in 
 
 
 
 :


 
  This condition is equivalent to the requirement that the polar 
 
 
 
  of the set 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 



 
  is an absorbent set in 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



Let now 
 
 
 
  be a family of bounded sets in 
 
 
 
  (with respect to 
 
 
 
 ) with the following properties:

each point 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  belongs to some set 
 
 






each two sets 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are contained in some set 
 
 
 
 :







 
  is closed under the operation of multiplication by scalars:



 
  Then the seminorms of the form


 
  define a Hausdorff locally convex topology on 
 
 
 
  which is called the polar topology1 on 
 
 
 
  generated by the family of sets 
 
 
 
 . The sets


 
  form a local base of this topology. A net of elements 
 
 
 
  tends to an element 
 
 
 
  in this topology if and only if


 
  Because of this the polar topology is often called the topology of uniform convergence on the sets of 
 
 
 
 . The semi norm 
 
 
 
  is the gauge of the polar set 
 
 
 
 .
Examples

if 
 
 
 
  is the family of all bounded sets in 
 
 
 
  then the polar topology on 
 
 
 
  coincides with the strong topology,
if 
 
 
 
  is the family of all finite sets in 
 
 
 
  then the polar topology on 
 
 
 
  coincides with the weak topology,
the topology of an arbitrary locally convex space

 
  can be described as the polar topology defined on 
 
 
 
  by the family 
 
 
 
  of all equicontinuous sets 
 
 
 
  in the dual space
