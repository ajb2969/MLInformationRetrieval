   Janko group J3      Janko group J3     In the area of modern algebra known as group theory , the Janko group  J 3 or the Higman-Janko-McKay group  HJM is a sporadic simple group of order   2 7 {{·}}3 5 {{·}}5{{·}}17{{·}}19 = 50232960  ≈ 5     ×   10  7       absent   superscript  10  7     \times 10^{7}   .   History and properties  J 3 is one of the 26 Sporadic groups and was predicted by Zvonimir Janko in 1969 as one of two new simple groups having 2 1+4 :A 5 as a centralizer of an involution (the other is the Janko group  J 2 ). J 3 was shown to exist by .  J 3 is one of the 6 sporadic simple groups called the pariahs because  showed that it is not a subquotient of the monster group .  J 3 has an outer automorphism group of order 2 and a Schur multiplier of order 3, and its triple cover has a unitary 9-dimensional representation over the finite field with 4 elements.  constructed it via an underlying geometry. It has a modular representation of dimension eighteen over the finite field with 9 elements. It has a complex projective representation of dimension eighteen.  Presentations  In terms of generators a, b, c, and d its automorphism group J 3 :2 can be presented as     a  17   =   b  8   =    a  b    a   -  2     =   c  2   =    b  c    b  3    =    (   a  b  c   )   4   =    (   a  c   )   17   =   d  2   =   [  d  ,  a  ]   =   [  d  ,  b  ]   =    (    a  3    b   -  3    c  d   )   5   =  1.         superscript  a  17    superscript  b  8           superscript  a  b    superscript  a    2           superscript  c  2           superscript  b  c    superscript  b  3          superscript    a  b  c   4         superscript    a  c   17         superscript  d  2         d  a         d  b         superscript     superscript  a  3    superscript  b    3    c  d   5        1.     a^{17}=b^{8}=a^{b}a^{-2}=c^{2}=b^{c}b^{3}=(abc)^{4}=(ac)^{17}=d^{2}=[d,a]=[d,b%
