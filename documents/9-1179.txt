History and properties
J3 is one of the 26 Sporadic groups and was predicted by Zvonimir Janko in 1969 as one of two new simple groups having 21+4:A5 as a centralizer of an involution (the other is the Janko group  J2). J3 was shown to exist by .
J3 is one of the 6 sporadic simple groups called the pariahs because  showed that it is not a subquotient of the monster group.
J3 has an outer automorphism group of order 2 and a Schur multiplier of order 3, and its triple cover has a unitary 9-dimensional representation over the finite field with 4 elements.  constructed it via an underlying geometry. It has a modular representation of dimension eighteen over the finite field with 9 elements. It has a complex projective representation of dimension eighteen.
Presentations

Maximal subgroups
found the 9 conjugacy classes of maximal subgroups of J3 as follows:

PSL(2,16):2, order 8160
PSL(2,19), order 3420
PSL(2,19), conjugate to preceding class in J3:2
24: (3 × A5), order 2880
PSL(2,17), order 2448
(3 × A6):22, order 2160 - normalizer of subgroup of order 3
32+1+2:8, order 1944 - normalizer of Sylow 3-subgroup
21+4:A5, order 1920 - centralizer of involution
22+4: (3 × S3), order 1152
