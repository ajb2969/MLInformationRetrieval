Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem

In additive number theory, the Skolem–Mahler–Lech theorem states that if a sequence of numbers is generated by a linear recurrence relation, then with finitely many exceptions the positions at which the sequence is zero form a regularly repeating pattern. More precisely, this set of positions can be decomposed into the union of a finite set and finitely many full arithmetic progressions. Here, a full arithmetic progression means a set of all non-negative integers of the form ax + b where a and b are a fixed pair of integers that define the progression and x ranges over all integers that make this expression non-negative.
This result is named after Thoralf Skolem, Kurt Mahler, and Christer Lech. Its proofs use p-adic analysis.
Example
Consider the sequence

0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 2, 0, 3, 0, 5, 0, 8, 0, ...
 

that alternates between zeros and the Fibonacci numbers. This sequence can be generated by the linear recurrence relation


 
  (a modified form of the Fibonacci recurrence), starting from the base cases F(0) = F(1) = F(3) = 0 and F(2) = 1. For this sequence, F(i) = 0 if and only if i is either zero or odd. Thus, the positions at which the sequence is zero can be partitioned into a finite set (the singleton set {0}) and a full arithmetic progression (the non-negative odd numbers).
In this example, only one arithmetic progression was needed, but other recurrence sequences may have zeros at positions forming multiple arithmetic progressions.
