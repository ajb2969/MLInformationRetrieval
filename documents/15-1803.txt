Brownian meander

In the mathematical theory of probability, Brownian meander

 
  is a continuous non-homogeneous Markov process defined as follows:
Let 
 
 
 
  be a standard one-dimensional Brownian motion, and 
 
 
 
 , i.e the last time before t = 1 when 
 
 
 
  visits 
 
 
 
 . Then



The transition density

 
  of Brownian meander is described as follows:
For 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and writing



we have



and



In particular,



i.e 
 
 
 
  has the Rayleigh distribution with parameter 1, the same distribution as 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is an exponential random variable with parameter 1.
