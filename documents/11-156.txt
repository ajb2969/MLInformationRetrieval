2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase

In enzymology, a 2-oxopent-4-enoate hydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate 
 
 
 
  2-oxopent-4-enoate + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate, and two products, 2-oxopent-4-enoate and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate hydro-lyase (2-oxopent-4-enoate-forming). Other names in common use include 2-keto-4-pentenoate hydratase, OEH, 2-keto-4-pentenoate (vinylpyruvate)hydratase, and 4-hydroxy-2-oxopentanoate hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in 9 metabolic pathways: phenylalanine metabolism, benzoate degradation via hydroxylation, biphenyl degradation, toluene and xylene degradation, 1,4-dichlorobenzene degradation, fluorene degradation, carbazole degradation, ethylbenzene degradation, and styrene degradation.
