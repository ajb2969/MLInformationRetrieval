Critical distance




Critical distance

Critical distance is, in audio physics, the distance at which the sound pressure level of the direct sound D and the reverberant sound R are equal when dealing with a directional source. In other words, the point in space where the combined amplitude of all the reflected echoes are the same as the amplitude of the sound coming directly from the source (D = R). This distance, called the critical distance 
 
 
 
 , is dependent on the geometry and absorption of the space in which the sound waves propagate, as well as the dimensions and shape of the sound source.

A reverberant room generates a short critical distance and an acoustically dead (anechoic) room generates a longer critical distance.
Calculation
The calculation of the critical distance for a diffuse approximation of the reverberant field:


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the degree of directivity of the source (
 
 
 
  for an omnidirectional source), 
 
 
 
  the equivalent absorption surface, 
 
 
 
  the room volume in m3 and 
 
 
 
  the reverberation time of room in seconds. The latter approximation is using Sabine's reverberation formula 
 
 
 
 .
