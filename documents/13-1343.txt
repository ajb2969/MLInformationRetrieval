   Nuclear C*-algebra      Nuclear C*-algebra   In mathematics, a nuclear C*-algebra is a C*-algebra  A such that the injective and projective C*-cross norms on A ⊗ B are the same for every C*-algebra B . These were first studied by  under the name "Property T" (this is unconnected with Kazhdan's property T ).  Characterizations  Nuclearity admits the following equivalent characterizations:   A C*-algebra is nuclear if the identity map, as a completely positive map , approximately factors through matrix algebras. Abelian C*-algebras are nuclear. One might say that nuclearity means that the C*-algebra admits noncommutative " partitions of unity ."  A C*-algebra is nuclear if and only if its enveloping von Neumann algebra is injective.  A separable C*-algebra is nuclear if and only if it is isomorphic to a C*-subalgebra B of the Cuntz algebra     𝒪  2     subscript  𝒪  2    \mathcal{O}_{2}   with the property that there exists a conditional expectation from    𝒪  2     subscript  𝒪  2    \mathcal{O}_{2}   to B .  A C*-algebra is nuclear if and only if it is amenable as a Banach algebra.
