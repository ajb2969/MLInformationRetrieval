   N-hydroxythioamide S-beta-glucosyltransferase      N-hydroxythioamide S-beta-glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a N-hydroxythioamide S-beta-glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + N-hydroxy-2-phenylethanethioamide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + desulfoglucotropeolin   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and N-hydroxy-2-phenylethanethioamide , whereas its two products are UDP and desulfoglucotropeolin .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:N-hydroxy-2-phenylethanethioamide S-beta-D-glucosyltransferase . Other names in common use include desulfoglucosinolate-uridine diphosphate glucosyltransferase , uridine diphosphoglucose-thiohydroximate glucosyltransferase , thiohydroximate beta-D-glucosyltransferase , UDPG:thiohydroximate glucosyltransferase , thiohydroximate S-glucosyltransferase , thiohydroximate glucosyltransferase , and UDP-glucose:thiohydroximate S-beta-D-glucosyltransferase .
