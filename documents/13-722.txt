   Absorptance      Absorptance   Absorptance of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in absorbing radiant energy . It is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is absorbed at an interface, in contrast to the absorption coefficient , which is the ratio of the absorbed to incident electric field . 1 This should not be confused with absorbance .
