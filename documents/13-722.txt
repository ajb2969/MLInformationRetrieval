Absorptance

Absorptance of the surface of a material is its effectiveness in absorbing radiant energy. It is the fraction of incident electromagnetic power that is absorbed at an interface, in contrast to the absorption coefficient, which is the ratio of the absorbed to incident electric field.1 This should not be confused with absorbance.
Mathematical definitions
Hemispherical absorptance
Hemispherical absorptance of a surface, denoted A, is defined as2


 
  where

Φea is the radiant flux absorbed by that surface;
Φei is the radiant flux received by that surface.

Spectral hemispherical absorptance
Spectral hemispherical absorptance in frequency and spectral hemispherical absorptance in wavelength of a surface, denoted Aν and Aλ respectively, are defined as3





 
  where

Φe,νa is the spectral radiant flux in frequency absorbed by that surface;
Φe,νi is the spectral radiant flux in frequency received by that surface;
Φe,λa is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength absorbed by that surface;
Φe,λi is the spectral radiant flux in wavelength received by that surface.

Directional absorptance
Directional absorptance of a surface, denoted AΩ, is defined as4


 
  where

Le,Ωa is the radiance absorbed by that surface;
Le,Ωi is the radiance received by that surface.

Spectral directional absorptance
Spectral directional absorptance in frequency and spectral directional absorptance in wavelength of a surface, denoted Aν,Ω and Aλ,Ω respectively, are defined as5





 
  where

Le,Ω,νa is the spectral radiance in frequency absorbed by that surface;
Le,Ω,νi is the spectral radiance received by that surface;
Le,Ω,λa is the spectral radiance in wavelength absorbed by that surface;
Le,Ω,λi is the spectral radiance in wavelength received by that surface.
