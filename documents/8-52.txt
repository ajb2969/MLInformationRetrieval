Specht module

In mathematics, a Specht module is one of the representations of symmetric groups studied by . They are indexed by partitions, and in characteristic 0 the Specht modules of partitions of n form a complete set of irreducible representations of the symmetric group on n points.
Definition
Fix a partition λ of n. A tabloid is an equivalence class of labellings of the Young diagram of shape λ, where two labellings are equivalent if one is obtained from the other by permuting the entries of each row. Denote by 
 
 
 
  the equivalence class of a tableau 
 
 
 
 . The symmetric group on n points acts on the set of tableaux of shape λ (i.e., on the set of labellings of the Young diagram). Consequently, it acts on tabloids, and on the module V with the tabloids as basis. For each Young tableau T of shape λ, form the element


 
  where QT is the subgroup of permutations, preserving (as sets) all columns of T and 
 
 
 
  is the sign of the permutation σ . The Specht module of the partition λ is the module generated by the elements ET as T runs through all tableaux of shape λ.
The Specht module has a basis of elements ET for T a standard Young tableau.
Structure
Over fields of characteristic 0 the Specht modules are irreducible, and form a complete set of irreducible representations of the symmetric group.
A partition is called p-regular if it does not have p parts of the same (positive) size. Over fields of characteristic p>0 the Specht modules can be reducible. For p-regular partitions they have a unique irreducible quotient, and these irreducible quotients form a complete set of irreducible representations.
