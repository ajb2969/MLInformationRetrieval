   Entropy (astrophysics)      Entropy (astrophysics)   In astrophysics , what is referred to as " entropy " is actually the adiabatic constant derived as follows.  Using the first law of thermodynamics for a quasi-static , infinitesimal process for a hydrostatic system        d  Q   =    d  U   -   d  W     .        d  Q       d  U     d  W      dQ=dU-dW.\,     For an ideal gas in this special case, the internal energy , U, is only a function of the temperature T; therefore the partial derivative of heat capacity with respect to T is identically the same as the full derivative, yielding through some manipulation        d  Q   =     C  V   d  T   +    P   d  V     .        d  Q        subscript  C  V   d  T     P  d  V      dQ=C_{V}dT+P\,dV.     Further manipulation using the differential version of the ideal gas law , the previous equation, and assuming constant pressure, one finds        d  Q   =     C  P   d  T   -    V   d  P     .        d  Q        subscript  C  P   d  T     V  d  P      dQ=C_{P}dT-V\,dP.     For an adiabatic process      d  Q   =   0         d  Q   0    dQ=0\,   and recalling    γ  =     C  P    C  V         γ     subscript  C  P    subscript  C  V      \gamma=\frac{C_{P}}{C_{V}}\,   , one finds               V   d  P   =    C  P   d  T       P   d  V   =   -    C  V   d  T             V  d  P      subscript  C  P   d  T        P  d  V        subscript  C  V   d  T       \frac{V\,dP=C_{P}dT}{P\,dV=-C_{V}dT}               d  P   P   =   -     d  V   V   γ     .          d  P   P           d  V   V   γ      \frac{dP}{P}=-\frac{dV}{V}\gamma.          One can solve this simple differential equation to find       P   V  γ    =  constant  =   K           P   superscript  V  γ    constant       K     PV^{\gamma}=\text{constant}=K\,     This equation is known as an expression for the adiabatic constant, K, also called the adiabat. From the ideal gas equation one also knows       P  =    ρ   k  B   T    μ   m  H      ,      P      ρ   subscript  k  B   T     μ   subscript  m  H       P=\frac{\rho k_{B}T}{\mu m_{H}},   where     k  B      subscript  k  B    k_{B}\,   is Boltzmann's constant . Substituting this into the above equation along with    V  =    [   g  r  a  m  s   ]   /   ρ        V     delimited-[]    g  r  a  m  s    ρ     V=[grams]/\rho\,   and    γ  =   5  /   3        γ    5  3     \gamma=5/3\,   for an ideal monatomic gas one finds       K  =     k  B   T    μ   m  H    ρ   2  /  3       ,      K       subscript  k  B   T     μ   subscript  m  H    superscript  ρ    2  3        K=\frac{k_{B}T}{\mu m_{H}\rho^{2/3}},   where    μ    μ   \mu\,   is the mean molecular weight of the gas or plasma ; and     m  H      subscript  m  H    m_{H}\,   is the mass of the Hydrogen atom , which is extremely close to the mass of the proton ,     m  p      subscript  m  p    m_{p}\,   , the quantity more often used in astrophysical theory of galaxy clusters . This is what astrophysicists refer to as "entropy" and has units of [keV cm 2 ]. This quantity relates to the thermodynamic entropy as      S  =     k  B    ln  Ω    +    S  0         S       subscript  k  B     normal-Ω     subscript  S  0      S=k_{B}\ln\Omega+S_{0}\,   where    Ω    normal-Ω   \Omega\,   , the density of states in statistical theory, takes on the value of K as defined above.
