Entropy (astrophysics)

In astrophysics, what is referred to as "entropy" is actually the adiabatic constant derived as follows.
Using the first law of thermodynamics for a quasi-static, infinitesimal process for a hydrostatic system



For an ideal gas in this special case, the internal energy, U, is only a function of the temperature T; therefore the partial derivative of heat capacity with respect to T is identically the same as the full derivative, yielding through some manipulation



Further manipulation using the differential version of the ideal gas law, the previous equation, and assuming constant pressure, one finds



For an adiabatic process

 
  and recalling 
 
 
 
 , one finds




















One can solve this simple differential equation to find



This equation is known as an expression for the adiabatic constant, K, also called the adiabat. From the ideal gas equation one also knows


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is Boltzmann's constant. Substituting this into the above equation along with 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  for an ideal monatomic gas one finds


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is the mean molecular weight of the gas or plasma; and 
 
 
 
  is the mass of the Hydrogen atom, which is extremely close to the mass of the proton, 
 
 
 
 , the quantity more often used in astrophysical theory of galaxy clusters. This is what astrophysicists refer to as "entropy" and has units of [keV cm2]. This quantity relates to the thermodynamic entropy as


 
  where 
 
 
 
 , the density of states in statistical theory, takes on the value of K as defined above.
