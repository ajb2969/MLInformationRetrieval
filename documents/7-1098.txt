   Value (mathematics)      Value (mathematics)   In mathematics, value may refer to several, strongly related notions:   The value of a variable or a constant is any number or other mathematical object assigned to it.  The value of a mathematical expression is the result of the computation described by this expression when the variables and constants in it are replaced by some numbers.  The value of a function is the number implied by the function as a result of a particular number being assigned to its argument (also called the variable of the function).   http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Value.html  1  For example, if the function   f   f   f   is defined by     f   (  x  )    =     2   x  2    -   3  x    +  1         f  x         2   superscript  x  2      3  x    1     f(x)=2x^{2}-3x+1   , then, given the value 3 to the variable x yields the function value 10 (since indeed ). This is denoted     f   (  3  )    =  10.        f  3   10.    f(3)=10.
