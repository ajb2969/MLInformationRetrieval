ISO 31-11

ISO 31-11 was the part of international standard ISO 31 that defines mathematical signs and symbols for use in physical sciences and technology. It was superseded in 2009 by ISO 80000-2.1
Its definitions include the following:2

These brace or fence characters are upper level unicode characters, fairly recently established and so may not display correctly in every browser. A close approximation of the appearance is found in the standard Latin characters: ( ), [ ], { }, . A more accurate glyph depiction of the mathematical angle bracket characters are found in the Chinese-Japanese-Korean (CJK) punctuation category: 〈h; 〉h;.
If the perpendicular symbol, ⟂h;, does not display correctly, it is similar to ⊥h; (up tack: sometimes meaning orthogonal to) and it also appears similar to ⏊h; (the dentistry: symbol light up and horizontal)
