   ISO 31-11      ISO 31-11   ISO 31-11 was the part of international standard  ISO 31 that defines mathematical signs and symbols for use in physical sciences and technology . It was superseded in 2009 by ISO 80000-2 . 1  Its definitions include the following: 2  Mathematical logic      Sign   Example   Name   Meaning and verbal equivalent   Remarks       ∧   p ∧ q   conjunction sign   p and q      ∨   p ∨ q   disjunction sign   p or q (or both)      ¬   ¬ p   negation sign   negation of p ; not p ; non p      ⇒   p ⇒ q   implication sign   if p then q ; p implies q   Can also be written as q ⇐ p . Sometimes → is used.     ∀   ∀ x ∈ A  p ( x ) (∀ x ∈ A ) p ( x )   universal quantifier   for every x belonging to A , the proposition p ( x ) is true   The "∈ A " can be dropped where A is clear from context.     ∃   ∃ x ∈ A  p ( x ) (∃ x ∈ A ) p ( x )   existential quantifier   there exists an x belonging to A for which the proposition p ( x ) is true   The "∈ A " can be dropped where A is clear from context. ∃! is used where exactly one x exists for which p ( x ) is true.
