   Integrability conditions for differential systems      Integrability conditions for differential systems   In mathematics , certain systems of partial differential equations are usefully formulated, from the point of view of their underlying geometric and algebraic structure, in terms of a system of differential forms . The idea is to take advantage of the way a differential form restricts to a submanifold , and the fact that this restriction is compatible with the exterior derivative . This is one possible approach to certain over-determined systems , for example. A Pfaffian system is specified by 1-forms alone, but the theory includes other types of example of differential system .  Given a collection of differential 1-forms α i , i =1,2, ..., k on an n -dimensional manifold M , an integral manifold is a submanifold whose tangent space at every point p ∈ M is annihilated by each α i .  A maximal integral manifold is a submanifold      i  :   N  ⊂  M      normal-:  i    N  M     i:N\subset M     such that the kernel of the restriction map on forms       i  *   :     Ω  p  1    (  M  )    →    Ω  p  1    (  N  )        normal-:   superscript  i     normal-→     superscript   subscript  normal-Ω  p   1   M      superscript   subscript  normal-Ω  p   1   N      i^{*}:\Omega_{p}^{1}(M)\rightarrow\Omega_{p}^{1}(N)     is spanned by the α i at every point p of N . If in addition the α i are linearly independent, then N is ( n − k )-dimensional. Note that i : N ⊂ M need not be an embedded submanifold.  A Pfaffian system is said to be completely integrable if N admits a foliation by maximal integral manifolds. (Note that the foliation need not be regular ; i.e. the leaves of the foliation might not be embedded submanifolds.)  An integrability condition is a condition on the α i to guarantee that there will be integral submanifolds of sufficiently high dimension.  Necessary and sufficient conditions  The necessary and sufficient conditions for complete integrability of a Pfaffian system are given by the Frobenius theorem . One version states that if the ideal   ℐ   ℐ   \mathcal{I}   algebraically generated by the collection of α i inside the ring Ω( M ) is differentially closed, in other words        d  ℐ   ⊂  ℐ   ,        d  ℐ   ℐ    d{\mathcal{I}}\subset{\mathcal{I}},     then the system admits a foliation by maximal integral manifolds. (The converse is obvious from the definitions.)  Example of a non-integrable system  Not every Pfaffian system is completely integrable in the Frobenius sense. For example, consider the following one-form on R 3 - (0,0,0)       θ  =     x   d  y   +    y   d  z   +    z   d  x     .      θ      x  d  y     y  d  z     z  d  x      \theta=x\,dy+y\,dz+z\,dx.     If d θ were in the ideal generated by θ we would have, by the skewness of the wedge product       θ  ∧   d  θ    =  0.        θ    d  θ    0.    \theta\wedge d\theta=0.     But a direct calculation gives       θ  ∧   d  θ    =     (   x  +  y  +  z   )   d  x   ∧   d  y   ∧   d  z          θ    d  θ          x  y  z   d  x     d  y     d  z      \theta\wedge d\theta=(x+y+z)\,dx\wedge dy\wedge dz     which is a nonzero multiple of the standard volume form on R 3 . Therefore, there are no two-dimensional leaves, and the system is not completely integrable.  On the other hand, the curve defined by       x  =  t   ,    y  =  c   ,    z  =   e   -   t  c      ,   t  >  0        formulae-sequence    x  t    formulae-sequence    y  c    formulae-sequence    z   superscript  e      t  c        t  0       x=t,\quad y=c,\qquad z=e^{-{t\over c}},\quad t>0     is easily verified to be a solution (i.e. an integral curve ) for the above Pfaffian system for any nonzero constant c .  Examples of applications  In Riemannian geometry , we may consider the problem of finding an orthogonal coframe θ i , i.e., a collection of 1-forms forming a basis of the cotangent space at every point with     ⟨   θ  i   ,   θ  j   ⟩   =   δ   i  j          superscript  θ  i    superscript  θ  j     superscript  δ    i  j      \langle\theta^{i},\theta^{j}\rangle=\delta^{ij}   which are closed (dθ i = 0, i=1,2, ..., n ). By the Poincaré lemma , the θ i locally will have the form d x i for some functions x i on the manifold, and thus provide an isometry of an open subset of M with an open subset of R n . Such a manifold is called locally flat.  This problem reduces to a question on the coframe bundle of M . Suppose we had such a closed coframe      Θ  =   (   θ  1   ,  …  ,   θ  n   )       normal-Θ    superscript  θ  1   normal-…   superscript  θ  n      \Theta=(\theta^{1},\dots,\theta^{n})   .  If we had another coframe    Φ  =   (   ϕ  1   ,  …  ,   ϕ  n   )       normal-Φ    superscript  ϕ  1   normal-…   superscript  ϕ  n      \Phi=(\phi^{1},\dots,\phi^{n})   , then the two coframes would be related by an orthogonal transformation      Φ  =   M  Θ       normal-Φ    M  normal-Θ     \Phi=M\Theta     If the connection 1-form is ω, then we have       d  Φ   =   ω  ∧  Φ         d  normal-Φ     ω  normal-Φ     d\Phi=\omega\wedge\Phi     On the other hand,      d  Φ      d  normal-Φ    \displaystyle d\Phi     But    ω  =    (   d  M   )    M   -  1         ω      d  M    superscript  M    1       \omega=(dM)M^{-1}   is the Maurer–Cartan form for the orthogonal group . Therefore it obeys the structural equation        d  ω   +  ω   ∧  ω   =  0   ,            d  ω   ω   ω   0    d\omega+\omega\wedge\omega=0,   and this is just the curvature of M    Ω  =     d  ω   +  ω   ∧  ω   =  0.        normal-Ω        d  ω   ω   ω        0.     \Omega=d\omega+\omega\wedge\omega=0.   After an application of the Frobenius theorem, one concludes that a manifold M is locally flat if and only if its curvature vanishes.  Generalizations  Many generalizations exist to integrability conditions on differential systems which are not necessarily generated by one-forms. The most famous of these are the Cartan-Kähler theorem , which only works for real analytic differential systems, and the Cartan–Kuranishi prolongation theorem . See Further reading for details.
