   M/D/1 queue      M/D/1 queue   In queueing theory , a discipline within the mathematical theory of probability , an M/D/1 queue represents the queue length in a system having a single server, where arrivals are determined by a Poisson process and job service times are fixed (deterministic). The model name is written in Kendall's notation . 1  Agner Krarup Erlang first published on this model in 1909, starting the subject of queueing theory . 2 3 An extension of this model with more than one server is the M/D/c queue .  Model definition  An M/D/1 queue is a stochastic process whose state space is the set {0,1,2,3,...} where the value corresponds to the number of customers in the system, including any currently in service.   Arrivals occur at rate λ according to a Poisson process and move the process from state i to i + 1.  Service times are deterministic time D (serving at rate μ = 1/ D ).  A single server serves customers one at a time from the front of the queue, according to a first-come, first-served discipline. When the service is complete the customer leaves the queue and the number of customers in the system reduces by one.  The buffer is of infinite size, so there is no limit on the number of customers it can contain.   Stationary distribution  The number of jobs in the queue can be written as an M/G/1 type Markov chain and the stationary distribution found for state i (written π i ) in the case D = 1 to be 4      π  0     subscript  π  0    \displaystyle\pi_{0}     Delay  Define ρ = λ / μ as the utilization; then the mean delay in the system in an M/D/1 queue is 5          1   2  μ    ⋅    2  -  ρ    1  -  ρ     .     normal-⋅    1    2  μ        2  ρ     1  ρ      \frac{1}{2\mu}\cdot\frac{2-\rho}{1-\rho}.        and in the queue:          1   2  μ    ⋅   ρ   1  -  ρ     .     normal-⋅    1    2  μ      ρ    1  ρ      \frac{1}{2\mu}\cdot\frac{\rho}{1-\rho}.        Busy period  The busy period is the time period measured from the instant a first customer arrives at an empty queue to the time when the queue is again empty. This time period is equal to D times the number of customers served.
