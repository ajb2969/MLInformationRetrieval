Zdeněk Frolík (March 10, 1933 – May 3, 1989) was a Czech mathematician. His research interests included topology and functional analysis. In particular, his work concerned covering properties of topological spaces, ultrafilters, homogeneity, measures, uniform spaces. He was one of the founders of modern descriptive theory of sets and spaces.1
Two classes of topological spaces are given Frolík's name: the class P of all spaces 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is pseudocompact for every pseudocompact space 
 
 
 
 ,2 and the class C of all spaces 
 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  is countably compact for every countably compact space

Frolík prepared his Ph.D. thesis under the supervision of Miroslav Katetov and Eduard Čech.4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27
