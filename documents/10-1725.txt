Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase

In enzymology, a hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(5Z,9E,14Z)-(8xi,11R,12S)-11,12-epoxy-8-hydroxyicosa-5,9,14- trienoate + H2O 
 
 
 
  (5Z,9E,14Z)-(8xi,11xi,12S)-8,11,12-trihydroxyicosa-5,9,14-trienoate
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are (5Z,9E,14Z)-(8xi,11R,12S)-11,12-epoxy-8-hydroxyicosa-5,9,14-, trienoate, and H2O, whereas its product is (5Z,9E,14Z)-(8xi,11xi,12S)-8,11,12-trihydroxyicosa-5,9,14-trienoate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is (5Z,9E,14Z)-(8xi,11R,12S)-11,12-epoxy-8-hydroxyicosa-5,9,14-trienoat e hydrolase. Other names in common use include hepoxilin epoxide hydrolase, hepoxylin hydrolase, and hepoxilin A3 hydrolase. This enzyme participates in arachidonic acid metabolism.
