Casio fx-3650P is a programmable scientific calculator manufactured by Casio Computer Co., Ltd. It can store 12 digits for the mantissa and 2 digits for the exponent together with the expression each time when the "EXE" button is pressed. Also, the calculator can use the previous result to do calculations by pressing "Ans".12 This model is approved by the Hong Kong Examinations and Assessment Authority3 and can be used in the Hong Kong Diploma of Secondary Education Examination (HKDSE). This model, together with the model fx-50FH, also by Casio, are the most common of models used by secondary school students in Hong Kong.
Modes
The calculator is available in 6 modes:4

Basic arithmetic calculations
Complex number calculations
Standard deviation calculations
Regression calculations
Base-n calculations
Programs

Basic arithmetic calculations

Arithmetic calculations5
Fraction operations6

Fraction calculations7
Decimal↔fraction conversions8
Mixed fraction↔improper fraction conversions9

Degrees, minutes, seconds calculations11
Rounding (Must be used with Fix decimal display mode)12
Trigonometric functions13
Hyperbolic function14
Logarithm15
Natural logarithm16
Antilogarithm17
Differential calculus18
Integral calculus19

Complex number calculations
In this mode, if the result have both real and imaginary part, an "R↔I" symbol will appear at the top-right corner.20

Absolute value and argument calculations21
Rectangular↔polar form display22
Conjugate calculations23

Standard deviation calculations
This mode is for statistical calculation. For some input data, sum of squares of values (Σx2), sum of values (Σx), number of data (n), sample standard deviation (xσn-1) and population standard deviation (xσn) can be calculated.24
Regression calculations
This mode is for statistical calculation and can be divided further into25

Linear regression: y=A+Bx26
Logarithmic regression: y=A+B*ln x27
Exponential regression: ln y=ln A+Bx28
Power regression: y=A+xB29
Inverse regression: y=A+B/x30
Quadratic regression: y=A+Bx+Cx231

For some input ordered pairs, one of the below can be calculated.32 (The availability differs from modes.33)

Program
The calculator can hold up to 4 programs with total capacity of 360 bt Program commands:34

? - Operator input command, used when user's input is required. Usually used with →(variable)
→ - Assign to variable command, to assign the value before it to the variable after it. Always used as (value)→(variable).
: - Multi-statement separator, separate program statements.
◢ - Output command, output the value.


 
  - Conditional jump, jump when conditions are met.
= - Relational operator
≠ - Relational operator
> - Relational operator


 
  - Relational operator.
Goto - Unconditional jump, jump to label.
Lbl - Label, jump destination.

Conditional jumps35
Conditional jumps should be used in the syntax:
condition

statement 1:statement 2
 When condition is true, statement 1 is executed, then statement 2 is executed. If condition is false, statement 1 is skipped and statement 2 is executed.
E.g.: ...A=0
 
 
 
 A+1→B:C+5→D:... If A=0, both A+1→B and C+5→D is executed. If A≠0, only C+5→D is executed.
Unconditional jumps36
Unconditional jumps uses Goto and Lbl to operate.
When Goto n (where n is an integer in 0-9) is executed, the program will jump to Lbl n. Loops can be created with unconditional jumps.
System check
The calculator will perform system check when shift, 7 and ON is pressed together. The system check have 3 parts.
Part 1: light check - All lights will be on when the system check is initiated, press shift then all lights will be off. Press shift to proceed. The next 2 screens have similar functions.
Part 2: display check - The dot matrix screen will display "24      PRG13" and the LCD screen will display "0000000000 00". Press shift to proceed. Then the display become "BBBBBBBBBB" and "1111111111 11". Then "CCCCCCCCCC" and "222222222 22" and so on up till "JJJJJJJJJJ""9999999999 99". Press shift to proceed to part 3.
Part 3: key check - Press shift, the LCD will display 1. Press alpha, up, down, left, right in order. The display will increase by 1 each time you press a button. Next, press MODE, prog, 
 
 
 
 dx, x−1, x3, and so on up till Ans. When EXE is pressed, the display become "24      OK""13"(The display differs from version, the above is for version 4 of the calculator which is the latest version). Press ON to end the system check.
