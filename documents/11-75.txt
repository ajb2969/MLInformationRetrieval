   Formate—dihydrofolate ligase      Formate—dihydrofolate ligase   In enzymology , a formate—dihydrofolate ligase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + formate + dihydrofolate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + 10-formyldihydrofolate   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , formate , and dihydrofolate , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and 10-formyldihydrofolate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of ligases , specifically those forming generic carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is formate:dihydrofolate ligase (ADP-forming) . Other names in common use include formyltransferase, dihydrofolate , dihydrofolate formyltransferase , and formyl dihydrofolate synthase .
