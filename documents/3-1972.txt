   Tsirelson space      Tsirelson space   In mathematics , especially in functional analysis , the Tsirelson space is the first example of a Banach space in which neither an ℓ p space nor a c 0 space can be embedded. The Tsirelson space is reflexive .  It was introduced by B. S. Tsirelson in 1974. The same year, Figiel and Johnson published a related article () where they used the notation T for the dual of Tsirelson's example. Today, the letter T is the standard notation 1 for the dual of the original example, while the original Tsirelson example is denoted by T *. In T * or in T , no subspace is isomorphic , as Banach space, to an ℓ p space, 1 ≤ p 0.  All classical Banach spaces known to , spaces of continuous functions , of differentiable functions or of integrable functions , and all the Banach spaces used in functional analysis for the next forty years, contain some ℓ p or c 0 . Also, new attempts in the early '70s 2 to promote a geometric theory of Banach spaces led to ask 3 whether or not every infinite-dimensional Banach space has a subspace isomorphic to some ℓ p or to c 0 .  The radically new Tsirelson construction is at the root of several further developments in Banach space theory: the arbitrarily distortable space of Schlumprecht (), on which depend Gowers' solution to Banach's hyperplane problem 4 and the Odell–Schlumprecht solution to the distortion problem . Also, several results of Argyros et al. 5 are based on ordinal refinements of the Tsirelson construction, culminating with the solution by Argyros–Haydon of the scalar plus compact problem. 6  Tsirelson's construction  On the vector space ℓ ∞ of bounded scalar sequences  , let P n denote the linear operator which sets to zero all coordinates x j of x for which j ≤ n .  A finite sequence     {   x  n   }    n  =  1   N     superscript   subscript    subscript  x  n      n  1    N    \{x_{n}\}_{n=1}^{N}   of vectors in ℓ ∞ is called block-disjoint if there are natural numbers     {   a  n   ,   b  n   }    n  =  1   N     superscript   subscript    subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n      n  1    N    \textstyle\{a_{n},b_{n}\}_{n=1}^{N}   so that     a  1   ≤   b  1   <   a  2   ≤   b  2   <  …  ≤   b  N          subscript  a  1    subscript  b  1         subscript  a  2         subscript  b  2        normal-…        subscript  b  N      a_{1}\leq b_{1}   , and so that      (   x  n   )   i   =  0       subscript   subscript  x  n   i   0    (x_{n})_{i}=0   when    λ   e  j       λ   subscript  e  j     \lambda e_{j}   , for each n from 1 to N .  The unit ball  B ∞ of ℓ ∞ is compact and metrizable for the topology of pointwise convergence (the product topology ). The crucial step in the Tsirelson construction is to let K be the smallest pointwise closed subset of B ∞ satisfying the following two properties: 7   a. For every integer j in N , the unit vector  e j and all multiples    (   x  1   ,  …  ,   x  N   )      subscript  x  1   normal-…   subscript  x  N     \textstyle(x_{1},\dots,x_{N})   , for |λ| ≤ 1, belong to K .  b. For any integer N ≥ 1, if     1  2    P  N    (    x  1   +  ⋯  +   x  N    )         1  2    subscript  P  N      subscript  x  1   normal-⋯   subscript  x  N      \textstyle{{1\over 2}P_{N}(x_{1}+\cdots+x_{N})}   is a block-disjoint sequence in K , then    T  *     fragments  T     T*   belongs to K .   This set K satisfies the following stability property:   c. Together with every element x of K , the set K contains all vectors y in ℓ ∞ such that | y | ≤ | x | (for the pointwise comparison).   It is then shown that K is actually a subset of c 0 , the Banach subspace of ℓ ∞ consisting of scalar sequences tending to zero at infinity. This is done by proving that   d: for every element x in K , there exists an integer n such that 2 P n ( x ) belongs to K ,   and iterating this fact. Since K is pointwise compact and contained in c 0 , it is weakly compact in c 0 . Let V be the closed convex hull of K in c 0 . It is also a weakly compact set in c 0 . It is shown that V satisfies b , c and d .  The Tsirelson space T * is the Banach space whose unit ball is V . The unit vector basis is an unconditional basis for T * and T * is reflexive. Therefore, T * does not contain an isomorphic copy of c 0 . The other ℓ p spaces, 1 ≤ p $T*$ is reflexive () and finitely universal , which means that for some constant , the space   C   C   C   contains   X   X   X   -isomorphic copies of every finite-dimensional normed space, namely, for every finite-dimensional normed space   Y   Y   Y   , there exists a subspace   X   X   X   of the Tsirelson space with multiplicative Banach–Mazur distance to   C   C   C   less than   C   C   C   . Actually, every finitely universal Banach space contains almost-isometric copies of every finite-dimensional normed space, 8 meaning that    T  *     fragments  T     T*   can be replaced by  for every . Also, every infinite-dimensional subspace of   T   T   T   is finitely universal. On the other hand, every infinite-dimensional subspace in the dual    T  *     fragments  T     T*   of    ℓ  n  1     subscript   superscript  normal-ℓ  1   n    \scriptstyle{\ell^{1}_{n}}   contains almost isometric copies of   n   n   n   , the   n   n   n   -dimensional ℓ 1 -space, for all   T   T   T   .  The Tsirelson space    T  *     fragments  T     T*   is distortable , but it is not known whether it is arbitrarily distortable .  The space    T  *     fragments  T     T*   is a minimal Banach space. 9 This means that every infinite-dimensional Banach subspace of    T  *     fragments  T     T*   contains a further subspace isomorphic to    T  *     fragments  T     T*   . Prior to the construction of   c   c   c   , the only known examples of minimal spaces were ℓ p and   T   T   T    0 . The dual space    T  *     fragments  T     T*   is not minimal. 10  The space   n   n   n   is polynomially reflexive .  Derived spaces  The symmetric Tsirelson space  S ( T ) is polynomially reflexive and it has the approximation property . As with T , it is reflexive and no ℓ p space can be embedded into it.  Since it is symmetric, it can be defined even on an uncountable supporting set, giving an example of non- separable polynomially reflexive Banach space .
