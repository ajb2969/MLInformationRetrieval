Change of rings

In algebra, given a ring homomorphism

 
 , there are three ways to change the coefficient ring of a module; namely, for a right R-module M and a right S-module N,



 
 , the induced module.


 
 , the coinduced module.


 
 
 , the restriction of scalars.

They are related as adjoint functors:


 
  and


 
  This is related to Shapiro's lemma.
