Hautus lemma

In control theory and in particular when studying the controllability of a linear time-invariant system in state space form, the Hautus lemma, named after Malo Hautus, can prove to be a powerful tool. This result appeared first in 1 and.2 Today it can be found in most textbooks on control theory.
The main result
The Hautus lemma says that given a square matrix 
 
 
 
  and a 
 
 
 
  the following are equivalent:

The pair 
 
 
 
  is controllable
For all 
 
 
 
  it holds that 
 
 

For all 
 
 
 
  that are eigenvalues of 
 
 
 
  it holds that
