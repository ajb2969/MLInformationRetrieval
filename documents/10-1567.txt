Thiomorpholine-carboxylate dehydrogenase

In enzymology, a thiomorpholine-carboxylate dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

thiomorpholine 3-carboxylate + NAD(P)+ 
 
 
 
  3,4-dehydro-thiomorpholine-3-carboxylate + NAD(P)H + H+


The 3 substrates of this enzyme are thiomorpholine 3-carboxylate, NAD+, and NADP+, whereas its 4 products are 3,4-dehydro-thiomorpholine-3-carboxylate, NADH, NADPH, and H+.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-NH group of donors with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is thiomorpholine-3-carboxylate:NAD(P)+ 5,6-oxidoreductase. Other names in common use include ketimine reductase, and ketimine-reducing enzyme.
CRYM, a taxon-specific crystallin protein that also binds thyroid hormones has thiomorpholine-carboxylate dehydrogenase activity.
