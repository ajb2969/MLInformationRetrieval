   Mattig formula      Mattig formula   Mattig's formula is one of the most important formulae in observational cosmology and extragalactic astronomy which gives relation between radial coordinate and redshift of a given source. It depends on the cosmological model being used and is needed to calculate luminosity distance in terms of redshift. 1  Without dark energy  Derived by W. Mattig in a 1958 paper, 2 the mathematical formulation of the relation is, 3      r  1   =    c    R  0    H  0         q  0   z   +    (    q  0   -  1   )    (    -  1   +    1  +   2   q  0   z      )       q  0  2    (   1  +  z   )           subscript  r  1       c     subscript  R  0    subscript  H  0            subscript  q  0   z        subscript  q  0   1       1       1    2   subscript  q  0   z           superscript   subscript  q  0   2     1  z        r_{1}=\frac{c}{R_{0}H_{0}}\frac{q_{0}z+(q_{0}-1)(-1+\sqrt{1+2q_{0}z})}{q_{0}^{%
 2}(1+z)}     Where,     r  1   =    d  p   R   =    d  c    R  0           subscript  r  1      subscript  d  p   R           subscript  d  c    subscript  R  0       r_{1}=\frac{d_{p}}{R}=\frac{d_{c}}{R_{0}}   is the radial coordinate distance (proper distance at present) of the source from the observer while    d  p     subscript  d  p    d_{p}   is the proper distance and    d  c     subscript  d  c    d_{c}   is the comoving distance .         q  0   =    Ω  0   /  2        subscript  q  0      subscript  normal-Ω  0   2     q_{0}=\Omega_{0}/2   is the deceleration parameter while    Ω  0     subscript  normal-Ω  0    \Omega_{0}   is the density of matter in the universe at present.      R  0     subscript  R  0    R_{0}   is scale factor at present time while   R   R   R   is scale factor at any other time.      H  0     subscript  H  0    H_{0}   is Hubble's constant at present and     z   z   z   is as usual the redshift .     This equation is only valid if     q  0   >  0       subscript  q  0   0    q_{0}>0   . When     q  0   ≤  0       subscript  q  0   0    q_{0}\leq 0   the value of    r  1     subscript  r  1    r_{1}   cannot be calculated. From this radius we can calculate luminosity distance using the following formula,        D  L    =    R  0    r  1    (   1  +  z   )    =    c    H  0    q  0  2      [     q  0   z   +    (    q  0   -  1   )    (    -  1   +    1  +   2   q  0   z      )     ]           subscript  D  L      subscript  R  0    subscript  r  1     1  z             c     subscript  H  0    superscript   subscript  q  0   2      delimited-[]       subscript  q  0   z        subscript  q  0   1       1       1    2   subscript  q  0   z             D_{L}\ =\ R_{0}r_{1}(1+z)=\frac{c}{H_{0}q_{0}^{2}}\left[q_{0}z+(q_{0}-1)(-1+%
 \sqrt{1+2q_{0}z})\right]     When     q  0   =  0       subscript  q  0   0    q_{0}=0   we get another expression for luminosity distance using Taylor expansion ,       D  L   =    c   H  0     (   z  +    z  2   2    )         subscript  D  L       c   subscript  H  0      z     superscript  z  2   2       D_{L}=\frac{c}{H_{0}}\left(z+\frac{z^{2}}{2}\right)     But in 1977 Terrell devised a formula which is valid for all     q  0   ≥  0       subscript  q  0   0    q_{0}\geq 0   , 4       D  L   =    c   H  0    z   [   1  +    z   (   1  -   q  0    )     1  +    q  0   z   +    1  +   2   q  0   z        ]         subscript  D  L       c   subscript  H  0    z   delimited-[]    1      z    1   subscript  q  0       1     subscript  q  0   z       1    2   subscript  q  0   z            D_{L}=\frac{c}{H_{0}}z\left[1+\frac{z(1-q_{0})}{1+q_{0}z+\sqrt{1+2q_{0}z}}\right]     References    "  Category:Observational cosmology     Observations in Cosmology , Cambridge University Press ↩  ↩  Bradley M.
