Mattig formula

Mattig's formula is one of the most important formulae in observational cosmology and extragalactic astronomy which gives relation between radial coordinate and redshift of a given source. It depends on the cosmological model being used and is needed to calculate luminosity distance in terms of redshift.1
Without dark energy
Derived by W. Mattig in a 1958 paper,2 the mathematical formulation of the relation is,3


Where, 
 
 
 
  is the radial coordinate distance (proper distance at present) of the source from the observer while 
 
 
 
  is the proper distance and 
 
 
 
  is the comoving distance.




 
  is the deceleration parameter while 
 
 
 
  is the density of matter in the universe at present.
 


 
  is scale factor at present time while 
 
 
 
  is scale factor at any other time.
 


 
  is Hubble's constant at present and
 


 
  is as usual the redshift.
 



This equation is only valid if 
 
 
 
 . When 
 
 
 
  the value of 
 
 
 
  cannot be calculated. From this radius we can calculate luminosity distance using the following formula,



When 
 
 
 
  we get another expression for luminosity distance using Taylor expansion,



But in 1977 Terrell devised a formula which is valid for all
