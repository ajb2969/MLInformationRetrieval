   Tree taper      Tree taper   Tree taper is the degree to which a tree's stem or bole decreases in diameter as a function of height above ground. Trees with a high degree of taper are said to have poor form, while those with low taper have good form. The form of a tree is sometimes quantified by the Girard form class , which is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the butt-log scaling diameter to diameter at breast height . 1  Taper is often represented by mathematical functions fitted to empirical data, called taper equations . One such function, attributed to Ormerod, 2 is  (Figure)  Tree taper equation        d    (  h  )   2    =    D  2     (    H  -  h    H  -   h  b     )   1.6          d   superscript  h  2       superscript  D  2    superscript      H  h     H   subscript  h  b     1.6      d(h)^{2}={D^{2}}\left({H-h\over H-h_{b}}\right)^{1.6}     where:      d   (  h  )       d  h    d(h)   = stem diameter at height h,     D   D   D   = tree diameter at breast height,     H   H   H   = tree total height,     h   h   h   height of interest (h ≤ H), and      h  b     subscript  h  b    h_{b}   = breast height.  Once developed, taper equations can be used to predict the diameter at a given height, or the height for a given diameter.  Footnotes    "  Category:Forest modelling     Mesavage, C., and J.W.
