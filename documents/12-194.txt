Tree taper

Tree taper is the degree to which a tree's stem or bole decreases in diameter as a function of height above ground. Trees with a high degree of taper are said to have poor form, while those with low taper have good form. The form of a tree is sometimes quantified by the Girard form class, which is the ratio, expressed as a percentage, of the butt-log scaling diameter to diameter at breast height.1
Taper is often represented by mathematical functions fitted to empirical data, called taper equations. One such function, attributed to Ormerod,2 is

where:


 
  = stem diameter at height h,


 
  = tree diameter at breast height,


 
 
  = tree total height,


 
  height of interest (h â‰¤ H), and


 
  = breast height.
Once developed, taper equations can be used to predict the diameter at a given height, or the height for a given diameter.
