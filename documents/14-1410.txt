   Category O      Category O   Category O (or category   𝒪   𝒪   \mathcal{O}    ) is a mathematical object in representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras . It is a category whose objects are certain representations of a semisimple Lie algebra and morphisms are homomorphisms of representations.  Introduction  Assume that   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   is a (usually complex) semisimple Lie algebra with a Cartan subalgebra    𝔥   𝔥   \mathfrak{h}   ,   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is a root system and    Φ  +     superscript  normal-Φ     \Phi^{+}   is a system of positive roots . Denote by    𝔤  α     subscript  𝔤  α    \mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}   the root space corresponding to a root    α  ∈  Φ      α  normal-Φ    \alpha\in\Phi   and    𝔫  :=    ⊕   α  ∈   Φ  +      𝔤  α       assign  𝔫    subscript  direct-sum    α   superscript  normal-Φ       subscript  𝔤  α      \mathfrak{n}:=\oplus_{\alpha\in\Phi^{+}}\mathfrak{g}_{\alpha}   a nilpotent subalgebra.  If   M   M   M   is a   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -module and    λ  ∈   𝔥  *       λ   superscript  𝔥      \lambda\in\mathfrak{h}^{*}   , then    M  λ     subscript  M  λ    M_{\lambda}   is the weight space       M  λ   =   {  v  ∈  M  ;  ∀  h  ∈   𝔥   h  ⋅  v  =  λ   (  h  )   v  }   .     fragments   subscript  M  λ     fragments  normal-{  v   M  normal-;  for-all  h   h  h  normal-⋅  v   λ   fragments  normal-(  h  normal-)   v  normal-}   normal-.    M_{\lambda}=\{v\in M;\,\,\forall\,h\in\mathfrak{h}\,\,h\cdot v=\lambda(h)v\}.     Definition of category O  The objects of category O are   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -modules   M   M   M   such that      M   M   M   is finitely generated      M  =    ⊕   λ  ∈   𝔥  *      M  λ        M    subscript  direct-sum    λ   superscript  𝔥       subscript  M  λ      M=\oplus_{\lambda\in\mathfrak{h}^{*}}M_{\lambda}        M   M   M   is locally   𝔫   𝔫   \mathfrak{n}   -finite, i.e. for each    v  ∈  M      v  M    v\in M   , the   𝔫   𝔫   \mathfrak{n}   -module generated by   v   v   v   is finite-dimensional.   Morphisms of this category are the   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -homomorphisms of these modules.  Basic properties   Each module in a category O has finite-dimensional weight spaces .  Each module in category O is a Noetherian module .  O is an abelian category  O has enough projectives and injectives .  O is closed to submodules , quotients and finite direct sums  Objects in O are    Z   (  𝔤  )       Z  𝔤    Z(\mathfrak{g})   -finite, i.e. if   M   M   M   is an object and    v  ∈  M      v  M    v\in M   , then the subspace     Z   (  𝔤  )   v   ⊆  M        Z  𝔤  v   M    Z(\mathfrak{g})v\subseteq M   generated by   v   v   v   under the action of the center of the universal enveloping algebra , is finite-dimensional.   Examples   All finite-dimensional   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -modules and their   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -homomorphisms are in category O.  Verma modules and generalized Verma modules and their   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -homomorphisms are in category O.
