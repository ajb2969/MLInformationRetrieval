Category O

Category O (or category 
 
 
) is a mathematical object in representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras. It is a category whose objects are certain representations of a semisimple Lie algebra and morphisms are homomorphisms of representations.
Introduction
Assume that 
 
 
 
  is a (usually complex) semisimple Lie algebra with a Cartan subalgebra

 
 , 
 
 
 
  is a root system and 
 
 
 
  is a system of positive roots. Denote by 
 
 
 
  the root space corresponding to a root 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  a nilpotent subalgebra.
If 
 
 
 
  is a 
 
 
 
 -module and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is the weight space



Definition of category O
The objects of category O are 
 
 
 
 -modules 
 
 
 
  such that



 
  is finitely generated





 
  is locally 
 
 
 
 -finite, i.e. for each 
 
 
 
 , the 
 
 
 
 -module generated by 
 
 
 
  is finite-dimensional.

Morphisms of this category are the 
 
 
 
 -homomorphisms of these modules.
Basic properties

Each module in a category O has finite-dimensional weight spaces.
Each module in category O is a Noetherian module.
O is an abelian category
O has enough projectives and injectives.
O is closed to submodules, quotients and finite direct sums
Objects in O are 
 
 
 
 -finite, i.e. if 
 
 
 
  is an object and 
 
 
 
 , then the subspace 
 
 
 
  generated by 
 
 
 
  under the action of the center of the universal enveloping algebra, is finite-dimensional.

Examples

All finite-dimensional 
 
 
 
 -modules and their 
 
 
 
 -homomorphisms are in category O.
Verma modules and generalized Verma modules and their 
 
 
 
 -homomorphisms are in category O.
