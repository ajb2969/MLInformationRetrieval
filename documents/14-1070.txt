   Brjuno number      Brjuno number   In mathematics, a Brjuno number is an irrational number α such that        ∑   n  =  0   ∞     log   q   n  +  1      q  n     <  ∞        superscript   subscript     n  0           subscript  q    n  1      subscript  q  n        \sum_{n=0}^{\infty}\frac{\log q_{n+1}}{q_{n}}<\infty     where p n / q n are the convergents of the continued fraction expansion of α. Intuitively, these numbers do not have many large "jumps" in the sequence of convergents, in which the denominator of the ( n + 1)th convergent is exponentially larger than that of the n th convergent. Thus, in contrast to the Liouville numbers , they do not have unusually accurate diophantine approximations by rational numbers .  The Brjuno numbers are named after Alexander Bruno , who introduced them in ; they are also occasionally spelled Bruno numbers or Bryuno numbers . Bruno showed that germs of holomorphic functions with linear part e 2π i α are linearizable if α is a Brjuno number.  showed in 1987 that this condition is also necessary for quadratic polynomials. For other germs the question is still open.  Brjuno function  The real Brjuno function B ( x ) is defined for irrational x and satisfies       B   (  x  )    =   B   (   x  +  1   )          B  x     B    x  1      B(x)=B(x+1)          B   (  x  )    =    -   log  x    +   x  B   (   1  /  x   )           B  x         x      x  B    1  x       B(x)=-\log x+xB(1/x)   for all irrational x between 0 and 1.
