   Methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase      Methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase   In enzymology , a methenyltetrahydrofolate cyclohydrolase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   10-formyltetrahydrofolate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate and H 2 O , whereas its product is 10-formyltetrahydrofolate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in cyclic amidines.  This enzyme participates in glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism and one carbon pool by folate .  Synonyms  The systematic name of this enzyme class is 5,10-methenyltetrahydrofolate 5-hydrolase (decyclizing) .  Other names in common use include:   Citrovorum factor cyclodehydrase  cyclohydrolase  formyl-methenyl-methylenetetrahydrofolate synthetase (combined) .   Structural studies  As of late 2007, 6 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , and .
