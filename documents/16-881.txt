   Matrix product state      Matrix product state   (Figure)  A matrix product state of five particles, as drawn with Penrose graphical notation (also known as tensor diagram notation).   Matrix product state (MPS) is a pure quantum state of many particles, written in the following form:        |  Ψ  ⟩   =    ∑   {  s  }     Tr   [    A  1   (   s  1   )     A  2   (   s  2   )    ⋯   A  N   (   s  N   )     ]    |    s  1    s  2   …   s  N    ⟩      ,       ket  normal-Ψ     subscript    s      Tr   delimited-[]     superscript   subscript  A  1    subscript  s  1     superscript   subscript  A  2    subscript  s  2    normal-⋯   superscript   subscript  A  N    subscript  s  N       ket     subscript  s  1    subscript  s  2   normal-…   subscript  s  N         |\Psi\rangle=\sum_{\{s\}}\text{Tr}[A_{1}^{(s_{1})}A_{2}^{(s_{2})}\cdots A_{N}^%
 {(s_{N})}]|s_{1}s_{2}\ldots s_{N}\rangle,     where    A  i   (  s  )      superscript   subscript  A  i   s    A_{i}^{(s)}   are complex , square matrices of order   χ   χ   \chi   (this dimension is called local dimension). Indices    s  i     subscript  s  i    s_{i}   go over states in the computational basis. For qubits , it is     s  i   ∈   {  0  ,  1  }        subscript  s  i    0  1     s_{i}\in\{0,1\}   . For qudits (d-level systems), it is     s  i   ∈   {  0  ,  1  ,  …  ,   d  -  1   }        subscript  s  i    0  1  normal-…    d  1      s_{i}\in\{0,1,\ldots,d-1\}   .  It is particularly useful for dealing with ground states of one-dimensional quantum spin models (e.g. Heisenberg model (quantum) ). The parameter   χ   χ   \chi   is related to entanglement between particles. In particular, if the state is a product state (i.e. not entangled at all), it can be described as a matrix product state with    χ  =  1      χ  1    \chi=1   .  For states that are translationally symmetric, we can choose:        A  1   (  s  )    =   A  2   (  s  )    =  ⋯  =   A  N   (  s  )    ≡   A   (  s  )     .         superscript   subscript  A  1   s    superscript   subscript  A  2   s        normal-⋯        superscript   subscript  A  N   s         superscript  A  s      A_{1}^{(s)}=A_{2}^{(s)}=\cdots=A_{N}^{(s)}\equiv A^{(s)}.     In general, every state can be written in the MPS form (with   χ   χ   \chi   growing exponentially with the particle number N ). However, MPS are practical when   χ   χ   \chi   is small – for example, does not depend on the particle number. Except for a small number of specific cases (some mentioned in the section Examples ), such thing is not possible. Though, in many cases it serves as a good approximation.  MPS decomposition is not unique.  Introductions in. 1 and. 2 In the context of finite automata: 3  Obtaining MPS  One method to obtain MPS is to use Schmidt decomposition  times.  Examples  Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state  Greenberger–Horne–Zeilinger state , which for particles can be written as superposition of zeros and ones       |  GHZ  ⟩   =      |  0  ⟩     ⊗  N    +    |  1  ⟩     ⊗  N      2         ket  GHZ        superscript   ket  0    tensor-product  absent  N     superscript   ket  1    tensor-product  absent  N       2      |\mathrm{GHZ}\rangle=\frac{|0\rangle^{\otimes N}+|1\rangle^{\otimes N}}{\sqrt{%
 2}}   can be expressed as a Matrix Product State, up to normalization, with         A   (  0  )    =   [     1    0      0    0     ]      A   (  1  )    =   [     0    0      0    1     ]     ,     formulae-sequence     superscript  A  0     1  0    0  0        superscript  A  1     0  0    0  1       A^{(0)}=\begin{bmatrix}1&0\\
 0&0\end{bmatrix}\quad A^{(1)}=\begin{bmatrix}0&0\\
 0&1\end{bmatrix},   or equivalently, using notation from: 4       A  =   [      |  0  ⟩     0      0     |  1  ⟩      ]    .      A     ket  0   0    0   ket  1       A=\begin{bmatrix}|0\rangle&0\\
 0&|1\rangle\end{bmatrix}.     This notation uses matrices with entries being wave functions (instead of complex numbers), and when multiplying matrices using tensor product for its entries (instead of product of two complex numbers). Such matrix is constructed as       A  ≡     |  0  ⟩    A   (  0  )     +    |  1  ⟩    A   (  1  )     +  …  +    |   d  -  1   ⟩    A   (   d  -  1   )       .      A       ket  0    superscript  A  0       ket  1    superscript  A  1    normal-…     ket    d  1     superscript  A    d  1        A\equiv|0\rangle A^{(0)}+|1\rangle A^{(1)}+\ldots+|d-1\rangle A^{(d-1)}.   Note that tensor product is not commutative .  In this particular example, a product of two A matrices is:        A  A   =   [      |  00  ⟩     0      0     |  11  ⟩      ]    .        A  A      ket  00   0    0   ket  11       AA=\begin{bmatrix}|00\rangle&0\\
 0&|11\rangle\end{bmatrix}.     W state  W state , i.e. a being symmetric superposition of a single one among. Even through the state is permutation-symmetric, its simplest MPS representation is not. 5 For example:         A  1   =   [      |  0  ⟩     0       |  0  ⟩      |  1  ⟩      ]       A  2   =   [      |  0  ⟩      |  1  ⟩       0     |  0  ⟩      ]      A  3   =   [      |  1  ⟩     0      0     |  0  ⟩      ]      .     formulae-sequence     subscript  A  1      ket  0   0     ket  0    ket  1       formulae-sequence     subscript  A  2      ket  0    ket  1     0   ket  0         subscript  A  3      ket  1   0    0   ket  0         A_{1}=\begin{bmatrix}|0\rangle&0\\

 0&|0\rangle\end{bmatrix}.
