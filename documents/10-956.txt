   Quinoline 2-oxidoreductase      Quinoline 2-oxidoreductase   In enzymology , a quinoline 2-oxidoreductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   quinoline + acceptor + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   quinolin-1(2H)-one + reduced acceptor   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are quinoline , acceptor , and H 2 O , whereas its two products are quinolin-1(2H)-one and reduced acceptor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is quinoline:acceptor 2-oxidoreductase (hydroxylating) .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
