Nesbitt's inequality

In mathematics, Nesbitt's inequality is a special case of the Shapiro inequality. It states that for positive real numbers a, b and c we have:



Proof
First proof: AM-HM
By the AM-HM inequality on 
 
 
 
 ,


 
  Clearing denominators yields


 
  from which we obtain


 
  by expanding the product and collecting like denominators. This then simplifies directly to the final result.
Second proof: Rearrangement
Suppose 
 
 
 
 , we have that


 
  define





 
  The scalar product of the two sequences is maximum because of the Rearrangement inequality if they are arranged the same way, call 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  the vector 
 
 
 
  shifted by one and by two, we have:






Addition yields Nesbitt's inequality.
Third proof: Hilbert's Seventeenth Problem
The following identity is true for all 
 
 



 
  This clearly proves that the left side is no less than 
 
 
 
  for positive a,b and c.
Note: every rational inequality can be solved by transforming it to the appropriate identity, see Hilbert's seventeenth problem.
Fourth proof: Cauchy–Schwarz
Invoking the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality on the vectors 
 
 
 
  yields


 
  which can be transformed into the final result as we did in the AM-HM proof.
Fifth proof: AM-GM
We first employ a Ravi substitution: let 
 
 
 
 . We then apply the AM-GM inequality to the set of six values 
 
 
 
  to obtain


 
  Dividing by 
 
 
 
  yields


 
  Substituting out the 
 
 
 
  in favor of 
 
 
 
  yields


 
  which then simplifies directly to the final result.
Sixth proof: Titu's lemma
Titu's lemma, a direct consequence of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, states that for any sequence of 
 
 
 
  real numbers 
 
 
 
  and any sequence of 
 
 
 
  positive numbers 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 . We use its three-term instance with 
 
 
 
 -sequence 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 -sequence 
 
 
 
 :


 
  By multiplying out all the products on the lesser side and collecting like terms, we obtain


 
  which simplifies to


 
  By the rearrangement inequality, we have 
 
 
 
 , so the fraction on the lesser side must be at least 
 
 
 
 . Thus,
