   Periodic point      Periodic point   In mathematics , in the study of iterated functions and dynamical systems , a periodic point of a function is a point which the system returns to after a certain number of function iterations or a certain amount of time.  Iterated functions  Given an endomorphism  f on a set  X      f  :   X  →  X      normal-:  f   normal-→  X  X     f:X\to X   a point x in X is called periodic point if there exists an n so that         f   n    (  x  )    =  x         subscript  f  n   x   x    \ f_{n}(x)=x   where    f  n     subscript  f  n    f_{n}   is the n th iterate of f . The smallest positive integer n satisfying the above is called the prime period or least period of the point x . If every point in X is a periodic point with the same period n , then f is called periodic with period n .  If there exists distinct n and m such that        f  n    (  x  )    =    f  m    (  x  )           subscript  f  n   x      subscript  f  m   x     f_{n}(x)=f_{m}(x)   then x is called a preperiodic point . All periodic points are preperiodic.  If f is a diffeomorphism of a differentiable manifold , so that the derivative     f  n  ′     superscript   subscript  f  n   normal-′    f_{n}^{\prime}   is defined, then one says that a periodic point is hyperbolic if        |   f  n  ′   |   ≠  1   ,         superscript   subscript  f  n   normal-′    1    |f_{n}^{\prime}|\neq 1,     that it is attractive if        |   f  n  ′   |   <  1   ,         superscript   subscript  f  n   normal-′    1    |f_{n}^{\prime}|<1,     and it is repelling if       |   f  n  ′   |   >  1.         superscript   subscript  f  n   normal-′    1.    |f_{n}^{\prime}|>1.     If the dimension of the stable manifold of a periodic point or fixed point is zero, the point is called a source ; if the dimension of its unstable manifold is zero, it is called a sink ; and if both the stable and unstable manifold have nonzero dimension, it is called a saddle or saddle point .  Examples   A period-one point is called a fixed point .   Dynamical system  Given a real global dynamical system ( R , X , Φ) with X the phase space and Φ the evolution function ,      Φ  :    ℝ  ×  X   →  X      normal-:  normal-Φ   normal-→    ℝ  X   X     \Phi:\mathbb{R}\times X\to X   a point x in X is called periodic with period  t if there exists a t > 0 so that       Φ   (  t  ,  x  )    =   x         normal-Φ   t  x    x    \Phi(t,x)=x\,   The smallest positive t with this property is called prime period of the point x .  Properties   Given a periodic point x with period p , then     Φ   (  t  ,  x  )    =   Φ   (   t  +  p   ,  x  )          normal-Φ   t  x      normal-Φ     t  p   x      \Phi(t,x)=\Phi(t+p,x)\,   for all t in R  Given a periodic point x then all points on the orbit     γ  x     subscript  γ  x    \gamma_{x}   through x are periodic with the same prime period.   Examples  The logistic map         x   t  +  1    =   r   x  t    (   1  -   x  t    )     ,   0  ≤   x  t   ≤  1    ,   0  ≤  r  ≤  4      formulae-sequence   formulae-sequence     subscript  x    t  1      r   subscript  x  t     1   subscript  x  t          0   subscript  x  t        1         0  r       4      x_{t+1}=rx_{t}(1-x_{t}),\qquad 0\leq x_{t}\leq 1,\qquad 0\leq r\leq 4     exhibits periodicity for various values of the parameter r . For r between 0 and 1, 0 is the sole periodic point, with period 1 (giving the sequence 0, 0, 0, ..., which attracts all orbits). For r between 1 and 3, the value 0 is still periodic but is not attracting, while the value ( r -1)/ r is an attracting periodic point of period 1. With r greater than 3 but less than 1 + √6, there are a pair of period-2 points which together form an attracting sequence, as well as the non-attracting period-1 points 0 and ( r -1)/ r and a non-attracting period-2 cycle between two periodic points. As the value of parameter r rises toward 4, there arise groups of periodic points with any positive integer for the period; for some values of r one of these repeating sequences is attracting while for others none of them are (with almost all orbits being chaotic).
