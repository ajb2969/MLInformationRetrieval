   Beta-phosphoglucomutase      Beta-phosphoglucomutase   In enzymology , a beta-phosphoglucomutase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   beta-D-glucose 6-phosphate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , beta-D-glucose 1-phosphate , and one product , beta-D-glucose 6-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases , specifically the phosphotransferases (phosphomutases), which transfer phosphate groups within a molecule. The systematic name of this enzyme class is beta-D-glucose 1,6-phosphomutase . This enzyme participates in starch and sucrose metabolism .  Structural studies  20 structures have been solved for this enzyme PDB . Some of the accession codes are , , , , , and . Most of these structures detail metal fluoride analogue complexes which are used to mimic different states along the reaction coordinate.  References    Boyer, P.D.
