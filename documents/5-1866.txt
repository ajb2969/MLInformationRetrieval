   Selmer group      Selmer group   In arithmetic geometry , the Selmer group , named in honor of the work of  by , is a group constructed from an isogeny of abelian varieties . The Selmer group of an abelian variety A with respect to an isogeny  f : A → B of abelian varieties can be defined in terms of Galois cohomology as       Sel   (  f  )     (  A  /  K  )   =   ⋂  v   ker   (   H  1    (   G  K   ,  ker   (  f  )   )   →   H  1    (   G   K  v    ,   A  v    [  f  ]   )   /  im   (   κ  v   )   )      fragments   superscript  Sel  f    fragments  normal-(  A   K  normal-)     subscript   v   ker   fragments  normal-(   superscript  H  1    fragments  normal-(   subscript  G  K   normal-,  ker   fragments  normal-(  f  normal-)   normal-)   normal-→   superscript  H  1    fragments  normal-(   subscript  G   subscript  K  v    normal-,   subscript  A  v    fragments  normal-[  f  normal-]   normal-)    im   fragments  normal-(   subscript  κ  v   normal-)   normal-)     \mathrm{Sel}^{(f)}(A/K)=\bigcap_{v}\mathrm{ker}(H^{1}(G_{K},\mathrm{ker}(f))%
 \rightarrow H^{1}(G_{K_{v}},A_{v}[f])/\mathrm{im}(\kappa_{v}))     where A v [ f ] denotes the f - torsion of A v and    κ  v     subscript  κ  v    \kappa_{v}   is the local Kummer map        B  v    (   K  v   )    /  f    (    A  v    (   K  v   )    )    →    H  1    (   G   K  v    ,    A  v    [  f  ]    )       normal-→         subscript  B  v    subscript  K  v    f      subscript  A  v    subscript  K  v        superscript  H  1     subscript  G   subscript  K  v       subscript  A  v    delimited-[]  f        B_{v}(K_{v})/f(A_{v}(K_{v}))\rightarrow H^{1}(G_{K_{v}},A_{v}[f])   . Note that       H  1    (   G   K  v    ,    A  v    [  f  ]    )    /  im    (   κ  v   )            superscript  H  1     subscript  G   subscript  K  v       subscript  A  v    delimited-[]  f      im    subscript  κ  v     H^{1}(G_{K_{v}},A_{v}[f])/\mathrm{im}(\kappa_{v})   is isomorphic to     H  1    (   G   K  v    ,   A  v   )    [  f  ]        superscript  H  1     subscript  G   subscript  K  v     subscript  A  v     delimited-[]  f     H^{1}(G_{K_{v}},A_{v})[f]   . Geometrically, the principal homogeneous spaces coming from elements of the Selmer group have K v -rational points for all places v of K . The Selmer group is finite. This implies that the part of the Tate–Shafarevich group killed by f is finite due to the following exact sequence   0 → B ( K )/ f ( A ( K )) → Sel (f) ( A / K ) → Ш( A / K )[ f ] → 0.   The Selmer group in the middle of this exact sequence is finite and effectively computable. This implies the weak Mordell–Weil theorem that its subgroup B ( K )/ f ( A ( K )) is finite. There is a notorious problem about whether this subgroup can be effectively computed: there is a procedure for computing it that will terminate with the correct answer if there is some prime p such that the p -component of the Tate–Shafarevich group is finite. It is conjectured that the Tate–Shafarevich group is in fact finite, in which case any prime p would work. However, if (as seems unlikely) the Tate–Shafarevich group has an infinite p -component for every prime p , then the procedure may never terminate.  Ralph Greenberg has generalized the notion of Selmer group to more general p -adic Galois representations and to p -adic variations of motives in the context of Iwasawa theory .
