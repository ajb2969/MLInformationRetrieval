Selmer group

In arithmetic geometry, the Selmer group, named in honor of the work of  by , is a group constructed from an isogeny of abelian varieties. The Selmer group of an abelian variety A with respect to an isogeny f : A → B of abelian varieties can be defined in terms of Galois cohomology as



where Av[f] denotes the f-torsion of Av and 
 
 
 
  is the local Kummer map 
 
 
 
 . Note that 
 
 
 
  is isomorphic to 
 
 
 
 . Geometrically, the principal homogeneous spaces coming from elements of the Selmer group have Kv-rational points for all places v of K. The Selmer group is finite. This implies that the part of the Tate–Shafarevich group killed by f is finite due to the following exact sequence

0 → B(K)/f(A(K)) → Sel(f)(A/K) → Ш(A/K)[f] → 0.
 

The Selmer group in the middle of this exact sequence is finite and effectively computable. This implies the weak Mordell–Weil theorem that its subgroup B(K)/f(A(K)) is finite. There is a notorious problem about whether this subgroup can be effectively computed: there is a procedure for computing it that will terminate with the correct answer if there is some prime p such that the p-component of the Tate–Shafarevich group is finite. It is conjectured that the Tate–Shafarevich group is in fact finite, in which case any prime p would work. However, if (as seems unlikely) the Tate–Shafarevich group has an infinite p-component for every prime p, then the procedure may never terminate.
Ralph Greenberg has generalized the notion of Selmer group to more general p-adic Galois representations and to p-adic variations of motives in the context of Iwasawa theory.
