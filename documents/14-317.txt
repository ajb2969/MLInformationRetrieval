Orbital stability

In mathematical physics or theory of partial differential equations, the solitary wave solution of the form 
 
 
 
  is said to be orbitally stable if any solution with the initial data sufficiently close to 
 
 
 
  forever remains in a given small neighborhood of the trajectory of 
 
 
 
 .
Formal definition
Formal definition is as follows.1 Let us consider the dynamical system



with 
 
 
 
  a Banach space over 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . We assume that the system is 

 
 -invariant, so that 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
  and any 
 
 
 
 .
Assume that 
 
 
 
 , so that 
 
 
 
  is a solution to the dynamical system. We call such solution a solitary wave.
We say that the solitary wave 
 
 
 
  is orbitally stable if for any 
 
 
 
  there is 
 
 
 
  such that for any 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  there is a solution 
 
 
 
  defined for all 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
 , and such that this solution satisfies



Example
According to 2 ,3 the solitary wave solution 
 
 
 
  to the nonlinear Schrödinger equation


 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a smooth real-valued function, is orbitally stable if the Vakhitov–Kolokolov stability criterion is satisfied:



where



is the charge of the solution 
 
 
 
 , which is conserved in time (at least if the solution 
 
 
 
  is sufficiently smooth).
