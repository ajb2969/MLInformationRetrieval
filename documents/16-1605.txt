Congruence-permutable algebra

In universal algebra, two congruences

 
  are said to be permutable if 
 
 
 
 . A congruence-permutable algebra is one in which all congruences are permutable. A variety of algebras is congruence-permutable if every algebra in the variety is congruence-permutable.
A Mal'cev term is a term M for which



A congruence-permutable variety is one whose signature contains a Mal'cev term.
