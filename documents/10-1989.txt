N-acetylneuraminate lyase

In enzymology, a N-acetylneuraminate lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acetylneuraminate 
 
 
 
  N-acetyl-D-mannosamine + pyruvate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, N-acetylneuraminate, and two products, N-acetyl-D-mannosamine and pyruvate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the oxo-acid-lyases, which cleave carbon-carbon bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase (N-acetyl-D-mannosamine-forming). Other names in common use include N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase, acetylneuraminate lyase, sialic aldolase, sialic acid aldolase, sialate lyase, N-acetylneuraminic aldolase, neuraminic aldolase, N-acetylneuraminate aldolase, neuraminic acid aldolase, N-acetylneuraminic acid aldolase, neuraminate aldolase, N-acetylneuraminic lyase, N-acetylneuraminic acid lyase, NPL, NALase, NANA lyase, acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase, and N-acetylneuraminate pyruvate-lyase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
