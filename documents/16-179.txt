   Geometric quotient      Geometric quotient   In algebraic geometry , a geometric quotient of an algebraic variety  X with the action of an algebraic group  G is a morphism of varieties     π  :   X  →  Y      normal-:  π   normal-→  X  Y     \pi:X\to Y   such that 1   (i) For each y in Y , the fiber     π   -  1     (  y  )        superscript  π    1    y    \pi^{-1}(y)   is an orbit of G .  (ii) The topology of Y is the quotient topology : a subset    U  ⊂  Y      U  Y    U\subset Y   is open if and only if     π   -  1     (  U  )        superscript  π    1    U    \pi^{-1}(U)   is open.  (iii) For any open subset    U  ⊂  Y      U  Y    U\subset Y   ,     π  #   :    k   [  U  ]    →   k    [    π   -  1     (  U  )    ]   G        normal-:   superscript  π  normal-#    normal-→    k   delimited-[]  U      k   superscript   delimited-[]     superscript  π    1    U    G       \pi^{\#}:k[U]\to k[\pi^{-1}(U)]^{G}   is an isomorphism. (Here, k is the base field.)   The notion appears in geometric invariant theory . (i), (ii) say that Y is an orbit space of X in topology . (iii) may also be phrased as an isomorphism of sheaves     𝒪  Y   ≃    (    π  *    𝒪  X    )   G      similar-to-or-equals   subscript  𝒪  Y    superscript     subscript  π     subscript  𝒪  X    G     \mathcal{O}_{Y}\simeq(\pi_{*}\mathcal{O}_{X})^{G}   . In particular, if X is irreducible, then so is Y and     k   (  Y  )    =   k    (  X  )   G          k  Y     k   superscript  X  G      k(Y)=k(X)^{G}   : rational functions on Y may be viewed as invariant rational functions on X (i.e., rational-invariants of X ).  For example, if H is a closed subgroup of G , then    G  /  H      G  H    G/H   is a geometric quotient. A GIT quotient may or may not be a geometric quotient: but both are categorical quotients, which is unique; in other words, one cannot have both types of quotients (without them being the same).  Relation to other quotients  A geometric quotient is a categorical quotient . This is proved in Mumford's geometric invariant theory.  A geometric quotient is precisely a good quotient whose fibers are orbits of the group.  Examples   The canonical map      𝔸   n  +  1    ∖  0   →   ℙ  n      normal-→     superscript  𝔸    n  1    0    superscript  ℙ  n     \mathbb{A}^{n+1}\setminus 0\to\mathbb{P}^{n}   is a geometric quotient.  If L is a linearlized line bundle on an algebraic G -variety X , then, writing    X   (  0  )   s     subscript   superscript  X  s   0    X^{s}_{(0)}   for the set of stable points with respect to L , the quotient          X   (  0  )   s   →    X   (  0  )   s   /  G      normal-→   subscript   superscript  X  s   0      subscript   superscript  X  s   0   G     X^{s}_{(0)}\to X^{s}_{(0)}/G       is a geometric quotient.
