Geometric quotient

In algebraic geometry, a geometric quotient of an algebraic variety X with the action of an algebraic group G is a morphism of varieties

 
  such that1

(i) For each y in Y, the fiber 
 
 
 
  is an orbit of G.
 
(ii) The topology of Y is the quotient topology: a subset 
 
 
 
  is open if and only if 
 
 
 
  is open.
 
(iii) For any open subset 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  is an isomorphism. (Here, k is the base field.)
 

The notion appears in geometric invariant theory. (i), (ii) say that Y is an orbit space of X in topology. (iii) may also be phrased as an isomorphism of sheaves 
 
 
 
 . In particular, if X is irreducible, then so is Y and 
 
 
 
 : rational functions on Y may be viewed as invariant rational functions on X (i.e., rational-invariants of X).
For example, if H is a closed subgroup of G, then 
 
 
 
  is a geometric quotient. A GIT quotient may or may not be a geometric quotient: but both are categorical quotients, which is unique; in other words, one cannot have both types of quotients (without them being the same).
Relation to other quotients
A geometric quotient is a categorical quotient. This is proved in Mumford's geometric invariant theory.
A geometric quotient is precisely a good quotient whose fibers are orbits of the group.
Examples

The canonical map 
 
 
 
  is a geometric quotient.
If L is a linearlized line bundle on an algebraic G-variety X, then, writing 
 
 
 
  for the set of stable points with respect to L, the quotient
