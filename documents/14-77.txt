   Thermal ellipsoid      Thermal ellipsoid     Thermal ellipsoids , more formally termed atomic displacement parameters , are ellipsoids used in crystallography to indicate the magnitudes and directions of the thermal vibration of atoms in crystal structures . Since the vibrations are usually anisotropic (different magnitudes in different directions in space), an ellipsoid is a convenient way of visualising the vibration and therefore the symmetry and time averaged position of an atom in a crystal.  Thermal ellipsoids can be defined by a tensor , a mathematical object which allows the definition of magnitude and orientation of vibration with respect to three mutually perpendicular axes . The three principal axes of the thermal vibration of an atom are denoted    U  1     subscript  U  1    U_{1}   ,    U  2     subscript  U  2    U_{2}   , and    U  3     subscript  U  3    U_{3}   , and the corresponding thermal ellipsoid is based on these axes. The size of the ellipsoid is scaled so that it occupies the space in which there is a particular probability of finding the electron density of the atom. The particular probability is usually 50%. 1  See also   Debye–Waller factor   References  "  Category:Crystallography     ↩
