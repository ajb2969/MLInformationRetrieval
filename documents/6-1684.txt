   Length function      Length function   In mathematical field of geometric group theory , a length function is a function that assigns a number to each element of a group.  Definition  A length function  L : G → R + on a group  G is a function satisfying:      L   (  e  )       L  e    \displaystyle L(e)     Compare with the axioms for a metric and a filtered algebra .  Word metric  An important example of a length is the word metric : given a presentation of a group by generators and relations, the length of an element is the length of the shortest word expressing it.  Coxeter groups (including the symmetric group ) have combinatorial important length functions, using the simple reflections as generators (thus each simple reflection has length 1). See also: length of a Weyl group element .  A longest element of a Coxeter group is both important and unique up to conjugation (up to different choice of simple reflections).  Properties  A group with a length function does not form a filtered group , meaning that the sublevel sets      S  i   :=   {  g  ∣    L   (  g  )    ≤  i   }      assign   subscript  S  i    conditional-set  g      L  g   i      S_{i}:=\{g\mid L(g)\leq i\}   do not form subgroups in general.  However, the group algebra of a group with a length functions forms a filtered algebra : the axiom     L   (   g  h   )    ≤    L   (  g  )    +   L   (  h  )           L    g  h        L  g     L  h      L(gh)\leq L(g)+L(h)   corresponds to the filtration axiom.
