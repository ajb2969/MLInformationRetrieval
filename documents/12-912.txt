Sectrix of Maclaurin




Sectrix of Maclaurin

 In geometry, a sectrix of Maclaurin is defined as the curve swept out by the point of intersection of two lines which are each revolving at constant rates about different points called poles. Equivalently, a sectrix of Maclaurin can be defined as a curve whose equation in biangular coordinates is linear. The name is derived from the trisectrix of Maclaurin (named for Colin Maclaurin), which is a prominent member of the family, and their sectrix property, which means they can be used to divide an angle into a given number of equal parts. There are special cases are also known as arachnida or araneidans because of their spider-like shape, and Plateau curves after Joseph Plateau who studied them.
Equations in polar coordinates
We are given two lines rotating about two poles 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . By translation and rotation we may assume 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
 . At time 
 
 
 
 , the line rotating about 
 
 
 
  has angle 
 
 
 
  and the line rotating about 
 
 
 
  has angle 
 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are constants. Eliminate 
 
 
 
 
  to get 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . We assume 
 
 
 
  is rational, otherwise the curve is not algebraic and is dense in the plane. Let 
 
 
 
 
  be the point of intersection of the two lines and let 
 
 
 
  be the angle at 
 
 
 
 , so 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the distance from 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
  then, by the law of sines,


 
  so


 
  is the equation in polar coordinates.
The case 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is an integer greater than 2 gives arachnida or araneidan curves



The case 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
 
  is an integer greater than 1 gives alternate forms of arachnida or araneidan curves



A similar derivation to that above gives


 
  as the polar equation (in 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 ) if the origin is shifted to the right by 
 
 
 
 
 . Note that this is the earlier equation with a change of parameters; this to be expected from the fact that two poles are interchangeable in the construction of the curve.
Equations in the complex plane, rectangular coordinates and orthogonal trajectories
Let 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are integers and the fraction is in lowest terms. In the notation of the previous section, we have 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  then 
 
 
 
 , so the equation becomes 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 . This can also be written


 
  from which it is relatively simple to derive the Cartesian equation given m and n. The function 
 
 
 
  is analytic so the orthogonal trajectories of the family 
 
 
 
  are the curves 
 
 
 
 , or 
 
 

Parametric equations
Let 
 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are integers, and let 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is a parameter. Then converting the polar equation above to parametric equations produces


 
 . Applying the angle addition rule for sine produces


 
 . So if the origin is shifted to the right by a/2 then the parametric equations are


 
 . These are the equations for Plateau curves when 
 
 
 
 , or


 
 .
Inversive triplets
The inverse with respect to the circle with radius a and center at the origin of


 
  is


 
 . This is another curve in the family. The inverse with respect to the other pole produces yet another curve in the same family and the two inverses are in turn inverses of each other. Therefore each curve in the family is a member of a triple, each of which belongs to the family and is an inverse of the other two. The values of q in this family are


 
 .
Sectrix properties
Let 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are integers in lowest terms and assume 
 
 
 
  is constructible with compass and straightedge. (The value of 
 
 
 
  is usually 0 in practice so this is not normally an issue.) Let 
 
 
 
  be a given angle and suppose that the sectrix of Maclaurin has been drawn with poles 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  according to the construction above. Construct a ray from 
 
 
 
  at angle 
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be the point of intersection of the ray and the sectrix and draw 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  is the angle of this line then


 
  so 
 
 
 
 . By repeatedly subtracting 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  from each other as in the Euclidean algorithm, the angle 
 
 
 
  can be constructed. Thus, the curve is an m-sectrix, meaning that with the aid of the curve an arbitrary angle can be divided by any integer. This is a generalization of the concept of a trisectrix and examples of these will be found below.
Now draw a ray with angle 
 
 
 
  from 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be the point of intersection of this ray with the curve. The angle of 
 
 
 
  is


 
  and subtracting 
 
 
 
  gives an angle of


 
 . Applying the Euclidean Algorithm again gives an angle of 
 
 
 
  showing that the curve is also an n-sectrix.
Finally, draw a ray from 
 
 
 
  with angle 
 
 
 
  and a ray from 
 
 
 
  with angle 
 
 
 
 , and let 
 
 
 
  be the point of intersection. This point is on the perpendicular bisector of 
 
 
 
  so there is a circle with center 
 
 
 
  containing 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  so any point on the circle forms an angle of 
 
 
 
  between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . (This is, in fact, one of the Apollonian circles of P and P'.) Let 
 
 
 
  be the point intersection of this circle and the curve. Then 
 
 
 
  so


 
 . Applying a Euclidean algorithm a third time gives an angle of 
 
 
 
 , showing that the curve is an (m−n)-sectrix as well.
Specific cases
===q = 0=== This is the curve


 
  which is line through 
 
 

===q = 1=== This is a circle containing the origin and 
 
 
 
 . It has polar equation


 
 . It is the inverse with respect to the origin of the q = 0 case. The orthogonal trajectories of the family of circles is the family 
 
 
 
  These form the Apollonian circles with poles 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
===q = -1=== These curves have polar equation


 
 , complex equation 
 
 
 
  In rectangular coordinates this becomes 
 
 
 
  which is a conic. From the polar equation it is evident that the curves has asymptotes at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  which are at right angles. So the conics are, in fact, rectangular hyperbolas. The center of the hyperbola is always 
 
 
 
 . The orthogonal trajectories of this family are given by 
 
 
 
  which is the family of Cassini ovals with foci 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Trisectrix of Maclaurin
In the case where 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
  by switching the poles) and 
 
 
 
 , the equation is


 
 . This is the Trisectrix of Maclaurin which is specific case whose generalization is the sectrix of Maclaurin. The construction above gives a method that this curve may be used as a trisectrix.
Limaçon trisectrix
In the case where 
 
 
 
  (or 
 
 
 
  by switching the poles) and 
 
 
 
 , the equation is


 
 . This is the Limaçon trisectrix. The equation with the origin take to be the other pole is


 
 . The 3 in the numerator of q and the construction above give a method that the curve may be used as a trisectrix.
