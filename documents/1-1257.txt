   Channel reliability      Channel reliability   In telecommunication , channel reliability (ChR) is the percentage of time a channel was available for use in a specified period of scheduled availability .  Channel reliability is given by       C  h  R   =   100   (   1  -    T  o    T  s     )    =   100    T  a    T  s             C  h  R     100    1     subscript  T  o    subscript  T  s             100     subscript  T  a    subscript  T  s        ChR=100(1-\frac{T_{o}}{T_{s}})=100\frac{T_{a}}{T_{s}}     where T  o is the channel total outage time, T  s is the channel total scheduled time, and T  a is the channel total available time.
