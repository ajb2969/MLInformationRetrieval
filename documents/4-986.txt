   Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups      Stone's theorem on one-parameter unitary groups   In mathematics , Stone's theorem on one-parameter  unitary groups is a basic theorem of functional analysis that establishes a one-to-one correspondence between self-adjoint operators on a Hilbert space    H   H   H   and one-parameter families       (   U  t   )    t  ∈  𝐑      subscript   subscript  U  t     t  𝐑     (U_{t})_{t\in\mathbf{R}}     of unitary operators that are strongly continuous , i.e.,      ∀   t  0   ∈  𝐑  ,  ξ  ∈  H  :   lim   t  →   t  0      U  t   ξ  =   U   t  0    ξ     fragments  for-all   subscript  t  0    R  normal-,  ξ   H  normal-:  italic-   subscript    normal-→  t   subscript  t  0      subscript  U  t   ξ    subscript  U   subscript  t  0    ξ    \forall t_{0}\in\mathbf{R},~{}\xi\in H:\qquad\lim_{t\to t_{0}}U_{t}\xi=U_{t_{0%
 }}\xi     and are homomorphisms, i.e.,      ∀  s  ,  t  ∈  𝐑  :   U   t  +  s    =   U  t    U  s   .     fragments  for-all  s  normal-,  t   R  normal-:  italic-   subscript  U    t  s      subscript  U  t    subscript  U  s   normal-.    \forall s,t\in\mathbf{R}:\qquad U_{t+s}=U_{t}U_{s}.     Such one-parameter families are ordinarily referred to as strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups .  The theorem was proved by , and  showed that the requirement that     (   U  t   )    t  ∈  𝐑      subscript   subscript  U  t     t  𝐑     (U_{t})_{t\in\mathbf{R}}   be strongly continuous can be relaxed to say that it is merely weakly measurable, at least when the Hilbert space is separable.  This is a very stunning theorem, as it allows to define the derivative of the mapping , which is only supposed to be continuous. It is also related to the theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras .  Formal statement  Let     (   U  t   )    t  ∈  𝐑      subscript   subscript  U  t     t  𝐑     (U_{t})_{t\in\mathbf{R}}   be a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group. Then there exists a unique (not necessarily bounded) self-adjoint operator   A   A   A   such that      ∀  t  ∈  𝐑  :   U  t   =   e   i  t  A    .     fragments  for-all  t   R  normal-:  italic-   subscript  U  t     superscript  e    i  t  A    normal-.    \forall t\in\mathbf{R}:\qquad U_{t}=e^{itA}.     Conversely, let   A   A   A   be a (not necessarily bounded) self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space   H   H   H   . Then the one-parameter family     (   U  t   )    t  ∈  𝐑      subscript   subscript  U  t     t  𝐑     (U_{t})_{t\in\mathbf{R}}   of unitary operators defined by (using the Spectral Theorem for Self-Adjoint Operators)      ∀  t  ∈  𝐑  :   U  t   :=   e   i  t  A       fragments  for-all  t   R  normal-:  italic-   subscript  U  t   assign   superscript  e    i  t  A      \forall t\in\mathbf{R}:\qquad U_{t}:=e^{itA}     is a strongly continuous one-parameter group.  The infinitesimal generator of     (   U  t   )    t  ∈  𝐑      subscript   subscript  U  t     t  𝐑     (U_{t})_{t\in\mathbf{R}}   is defined to be the operator    i  A      i  A    iA   . This mapping is a bijective correspondence. Furthermore,   A   A   A   will be a bounded operator if and only if the operator-valued mapping is norm -continuous.  Stone's Theorem can be recast using the language of the Fourier transform . The real line   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   is a locally compact abelian group. Non-degenerate *-representations of the group C*-algebra  are in one-to-one correspondence with strongly continuous unitary representations of   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   , i.e., strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups. On the other hand, the Fourier transform is a *-isomorphism from to , the C*-algebra of complex-valued continuous functions on the real line that vanish at infinity. Hence, there is a one-to-one correspondence between strongly continuous one-parameter unitary groups and *-representations of . As every *-representation of corresponds uniquely to a self-adjoint operator, Stone's Theorem holds.  Therefore, the procedure for obtaining the infinitesimal generator of a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group is as follows.   Let     (   U  t   )    t  ∈  𝐑      subscript   subscript  U  t     t  𝐑     (U_{t})_{t\in\mathbf{R}}   be a strongly continuous unitary representation of   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   on a Hilbert space    H   H   H   .  Integrate this unitary representation to yield a non-degenerate *-representation   ρ   ρ   ρ   of on   H   H   H   by first defining         ∀  f  ∈   C  c    (  𝐑  )   :  ρ   (  f  )   :=   ∫  𝐑   f   (  t  )     U  t    d  t  ,     fragments  for-all  f    subscript  C  c    fragments  normal-(  R  normal-)   normal-:  italic-  ρ   fragments  normal-(  f  normal-)   assign   subscript   𝐑   f   fragments  normal-(  t  normal-)    subscript  U  t   d  t  normal-,    \forall f\in C_{c}(\mathbf{R}):\qquad\rho(f):=\int_{\mathbf{R}}f(t)U_{t}\,dt,       and then extending   ρ   ρ   ρ   to all of by continuity.    Use the Fourier transform to obtain a non-degenerate *-representation   τ   τ   τ   of on   H   H   H   .  By the Riesz-Markov Theorem ,   τ   τ   τ   gives rise to a projection-valued measure on   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   that is the resolution of the identity of a unique self-adjoint operator    A   A   A   , which may be unbounded.  Then    i  A      i  A    iA   is the infinitesimal generator of     (   U  t   )    t  ∈  𝐑      subscript   subscript  U  t     t  𝐑     (U_{t})_{t\in\mathbf{R}}   .   The precise definition of is as follows. Consider the *-algebra , the complex-valued continuous functions on   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   with compact support, where the multiplication is given by convolution . The completion of this *-algebra with respect to the -norm is a Banach *-algebra, denoted by    (    L  1    (  𝐑  )    ,  ⋆  )        superscript  L  1   𝐑   normal-⋆    (L^{1}(\mathbf{R}),\star)   . Then is defined to be the enveloping C*-algebra of    (    L  1    (  𝐑  )    ,  ⋆  )        superscript  L  1   𝐑   normal-⋆    (L^{1}(\mathbf{R}),\star)   , i.e., its completion with respect to the largest possible C*-norm. It is a non-trivial fact that, via the Fourier transform, is isomorphic to . A result in this direction is the Riemann-Lebesgue Lemma , which says that the Fourier transform maps to .  Example  The family of translation operators        (    T  t   ψ   )    (  x  )    =   ψ   (   x  +  t   )             subscript  T  t   ψ   x     ψ    x  t      \left(T_{t}\psi\right)(x)=\psi(x+t)     is a one-parameter unitary group of unitary operators; the infinitesimal generator of this family is an extension of the differential operator       d   d  x    =   i   1  i    d   d  x           d    d  x      i    1  i     d    d  x       \frac{d}{dx}=i\frac{1}{i}\frac{d}{dx}     defined on the space of complex-valued continuously differentiable functions of compact support on   𝐑   𝐑   \mathbf{R}   . Thus        T  t   =   e    t    d   d  x       .       subscript  T  t    superscript  e    t    d    d  x        T_{t}=e^{t\,\frac{d}{dx}}.     In other words, motion on the line is generated by the momentum operator .  Applications  Stone's theorem has numerous applications in quantum mechanics . For instance, given an isolated quantum mechanical system, with Hilbert space of states   H   H   H   , time evolution is a strongly continuous one-parameter unitary group on   H   H   H   . The infinitesimal generator of this group is the system Hamiltonian .  Generalizations  The Stone–von Neumann theorem generalizes Stone's theorem to a pair of self-adjoint operators,    Q  ,  P     Q  P    Q,P   satisfying the canonical commutation relation , and shows that these are all unitarily equivalent to the position operator and momentum operator on .  The Hille–Yosida theorem generalizes Stone's theorem to strongly continuous one-parameter semigroups of contractions on Banach spaces .  References      K.
