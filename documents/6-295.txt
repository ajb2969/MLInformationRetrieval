Mercer's condition

In mathematics, a real-valued function K(x,y) is said to fulfill Mercer's condition if for all square integrable functions g(x) one has



Examples
The constant function


 
  satisfies Mercer's condition, as then the integral becomes by Fubini's theorem


 
  which is indeed non-negative.
