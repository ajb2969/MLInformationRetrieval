Steinhaus theorem

In the mathematical field of real analysis, the Steinhaus theorem states that the difference set of a set of positive measure contains an open neighbourhood of zero. It was first proved by Hugo Steinhaus.1
Statement
Let A be a Lebesgue-measurable set on the real line such that the Lebesgue measure of A is not zero. Then the difference set



contains an open neighbourhood of the origin.
More generally, if G is a locally compact group, and A ⊂ G is a subset of positive (left) Haar measure, then



contains an open neighbourhood of unity.
The theorem can also be extended to nonmeagre sets with the Baire property. The proof of these extensions, sometimes also called Steinhaus theorem, is almost identical to the one below.
Proof
The following is a simple proof due to Karl Stromberg.2 If μ is the Lebesgue measure and A is a measurable set with positive finite measure



then for every ε > 0 there are a compact set K and an open set U such that



For our purpose it is enough to choose K and U such that



Since K ⊂ U, for each 
 
 
 
 , there is a neighborhood 
 
 
 
  of 0 such that 
 
 
 
 . The family 
 
 
 
  is an open cover of K. K is compact, hence one can choose a finite subcover 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
 . Then K + V ⊂ U.
Let v ∈ V, and suppose



Then,



contradicting our choice of K and U. Hence for all v ∈ V there exist



such that



which means that V ⊂ A − A. Q.E.D.
