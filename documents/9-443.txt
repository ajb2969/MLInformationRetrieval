   Steinhaus theorem      Steinhaus theorem   In the mathematical field of real analysis , the Steinhaus theorem states that the difference set of a set of positive measure contains an open  neighbourhood of zero. It was first proved by Hugo Steinhaus . 1  Statement  Let A be a Lebesgue-measurable set on the real line such that the Lebesgue measure of A is not zero. Then the difference set       A  -  A   =   {   a  -  b   ∣    a  ,  b   ∈  A   }         A  A    conditional-set    a  b      a  b   A      A-A=\{a-b\mid a,b\in A\}\,     contains an open neighbourhood of the origin.  More generally, if G is a locally compact group , and A ⊂ G is a subset of positive (left) Haar measure , then       A   A   -  1     =   {   a   b   -  1     ∣    a  ,  b   ∈  A   }         A   superscript  A    1      conditional-set    a   superscript  b    1        a  b   A      AA^{-1}=\{ab^{-1}\mid a,b\in A\}\,     contains an open neighbourhood of unity.  The theorem can also be extended to nonmeagre sets with the Baire property . The proof of these extensions, sometimes also called Steinhaus theorem, is almost identical to the one below.  Proof  The following is a simple proof due to Karl Stromberg. 2 If μ is the Lebesgue measure and A is a measurable set with positive finite measure       0  <   μ   (  A  )    <  ∞   ,        0    μ  A            0<\mu(A)<\infty,\,     then for every ε > 0 there are a compact set  K and an open set U such that        K  ⊂  A  ⊂  U   ,     μ   (  K  )    +  ϵ   >   μ   (  A  )    >    μ   (  U  )    -  ϵ     .     formulae-sequence      K  A       U            μ  K   ϵ     μ  A            μ  U   ϵ       K\subset A\subset U,\quad\mu(K)+\epsilon>\mu(A)>\mu(U)-\epsilon.     For our purpose it is enough to choose K and U such that        2  μ   (  K  )    >   μ   (  U  )     .        2  μ  K     μ  U     2\mu(K)>\mu(U).\,     Since K ⊂ U , for each    k  ∈  K      k  K    k\in K   , there is a neighborhood    V  k     subscript  V  k    V_{k}   of 0 such that    k  +    V  k    \sub   U       k     subscript  V  k   \sub  U     k+V_{k}\sub U   . The family    {   k  +   V  k    :   k  ∈  K   }     conditional-set    k   subscript  V  k      k  K     \{k+V_{k}:k\in K\}   is an open cover of K . K is compact, hence one can choose a finite subcover    {    k  1   +   V   k  1     ,  …  ,    k  n   +   V   k  n     }        subscript  k  1    subscript  V   subscript  k  1     normal-…     subscript  k  n    subscript  V   subscript  k  n       \{k_{1}+V_{k_{1}},\dots,k_{n}+V_{k_{n}}\}   . Let    V  :=    V   k  1    ∩  …  ∩   V   k  n        assign  V     subscript  V   subscript  k  1    normal-…   subscript  V   subscript  k  n       V:=V_{k_{1}}\cap\dots\cap V_{k_{n}}   . Then K + V ⊂ U .  Let v ∈ V , and suppose         (   K  +  v   )   ∩  K   =  ∅   .          K  v   K      (K+v)\cap K=\varnothing.\,     Then,       2  μ   (  K  )    =    μ   (   K  +  v   )    +   μ   (  K  )     <   μ   (  U  )            2  μ  K       μ    K  v      μ  K           μ  U      2\mu(K)=\mu(K+v)+\mu(K)<\mu(U)\,     contradicting our choice of K and U . Hence for all v ∈ V there exist        k  1   ,   k  2    ∈  K  ⊂   A           subscript  k  1    subscript  k  2    K       A     k_{1},k_{2}\in K\subset A\,     such that        v  +   k  1    =   k  2    ,        v   subscript  k  1     subscript  k  2     v+k_{1}=k_{2},\,     which means that V ⊂ A − A .
