   Topological entropy      Topological entropy   In mathematics , the topological entropy of a topological dynamical system is a nonnegative real number that is a measure of the complexity of the system. Topological entropy was first introduced in 1965 by Adler , Konheim and McAndrew. Their definition was modelled after the definition of the Kolmogorov‚ÄìSinai , or metric entropy . Later, Dinaburg and Rufus Bowen gave a different, weaker definition reminiscent of the Hausdorff dimension . The second definition clarified the meaning of the topological entropy: for a system given by an iterated function , the topological entropy represents the exponential growth rate of the number of distinguishable orbits of the iterates. An important variational principle relates the notions of topological and measure-theoretic entropy.  Definition  A topological dynamical system consists of a Hausdorff topological space  X (usually assumed to be compact ) and a continuous self-map f . Its topological entropy is a nonnegative real number that can be defined in various ways, which are known to be equivalent.  Definition of Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew  Let X be a compact Hausdorff topological space. For any finite open cover  C of X , let H ( C ) be the logarithm (usually to base 2) of the smallest number of elements of C that cover X . 1 For two covers C and D , let      C  ‚à®  D      C  D    C\vee D     be their (minimal) common refinement, which consists of all the non-empty intersections of a set from C with a set from D , and similarly for multiple covers. For any continuous map  f : X ‚Üí X , the following limit exists:        H   (  C  ,  f  )    =    lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû      1  n   H   (   C  ‚à®    f   -  1    C   ‚à®  ‚Ä¶  ‚à®    f    -  n   +  1    C    )      .        H   C  f      subscript    normal-‚Üí  n         1  n   H    C     superscript  f    1    C   normal-‚Ä¶     superscript  f      n   1    C        H(C,f)=\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{1}{n}H(C\vee f^{-1}C\vee\ldots\vee f^{-n+1}C).     Then the topological entropy of f , denoted h ( f ), is defined to be the supremum of H ( C , f ) over all possible finite covers C of X .  Interpretation  The parts of C may be viewed as symbols that (partially) describe the position of a point x in X : all points x ‚àà C i are assigned the symbol C i . Imagine that the position of x is (imperfectly) measured by a certain device and that each part of C corresponds to one possible outcome of the measurement. The integer    H   (   C  ‚à®    f   -  1    C   ‚à®  ‚Ä¶  ‚à®    f    -  n   +  1    C    )       H    C     superscript  f    1    C   normal-‚Ä¶     superscript  f      n   1    C      H(C\vee f^{-1}C\vee\ldots\vee f^{-n+1}C)   then represents the minimal number of "words" of length n needed to encode the points of X according to the behavior of their first n ‚àí 1 iterates under f , or, put differently, the total number of "scenarios" of the behavior of these iterates, as "seen" by the partition C . Thus the topological entropy is the average (per iteration) amount of information needed to describe long iterations of the map f .  Definition of Bowen and Dinaburg  This definition uses a metric on X (actually, uniform structure would suffice). This is a weaker definition than that of Adler, Konheim, and McAndrew, as it requires additional, unnecessary structure on the topological space. However, in practice, the Bowen-Dinaburg topological entropy is usually much easier to calculate.  Let ( X , d ) be a compact  metric space and f : X ‚Üí X be a continuous map . For each natural number  n , a new metric d n is defined on X by the formula     f   f   f     Interpretation  Since X is compact, N ( n , Œµ ) is finite and represents the number of distinguishable orbit segments of length n , assuming that we cannot distinguish points within Œµ of one another. A straightforward argument shows that the limit defining h ( f ) always exists in the extended real line (but could be infinite). This limit may be interpreted as the measure of the average exponential growth of the number of distinguishable orbit segments. In this sense, it measures complexity of the topological dynamical system ( X , f ). Rufus Bowen extended this definition of topological entropy in a way which permits X to be noncompact.  Properties   Let   X   X   X   be an expansive homeomorphism of a compact metric space   C   C   C   and let   f   f   f   be a topological generator. Then the topological entropy of   C   C   C   relative to   f   f   f   is equal to the topological entropy of     h   (  f  )    =   H   (  f  ,  C  )          h  f     H   f  C      h(f)=H(f,C)   , i.e.       f  :   X  ‚Üí  X      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí  X  X     f:X\rightarrow X   .   Let   X   X   X   be a continuous transformation of a compact metric space     h  Œº    (  f  )        subscript  h  Œº   f    h_{\mu}(f)   , let   f   f   f   be the measure-theoretic entropy of   Œº   Œº   \mu   with respect to    M   (  X  ,  f  )       M   X  f     M(X,f)   and   f   f   f   is the set of all     h   (  f  )    =    sup   Œº  ‚àà   M   (  X  ,  f  )        h  Œº    (  f  )           h  f     subscript  supremum    Œº    M   X  f         subscript  h  Œº   f      h(f)=\sup_{\mu\in M(X,f)}h_{\mu}(f)   -invariant Borel probability measures. Then       h  Œº     subscript  h  Œº    h_{\mu}   .   In general the maximum of the functions     Œº  ‚Ü¶    h  Œº    (  f  )     :    M   (  X  ,  f  )    ‚Üí   \R       normal-:   maps-to  Œº     subscript  h  Œº   f     normal-‚Üí    M   X  f    \R     \mu\mapsto h_{\mu}(f):M(X,f)\rightarrow\R   over the set M(X,f) is not attained, but if additionally the entropy map      f   f   f   is upper semicontinuous , the measure of maximal entropy exists.   If   Œº   Œº   \mu   has a unique measure of maximal entropy   f   f   f   , then   Œº   Œº   \mu   is ergodic with respect to    œÉ  :    Œ£  k   ‚Üí  Œ£      normal-:  œÉ   normal-‚Üí   subscript  normal-Œ£  k   normal-Œ£     \sigma:\Sigma_{k}\rightarrow\Sigma   .   Examples   Let     x  n   ‚Ü¶   x   n  -  1       maps-to   subscript  x  n    subscript  x    n  1      x_{n}\mapsto x_{n-1}   by    {  1  ,  ‚Ä¶  ,  k  }     1  normal-‚Ä¶  k    \{1,\dots,k\}   denote the full two-sided k-shift on symbols    C  =   {   [  1  ]   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   [  k  ]   }       C    delimited-[]  1   normal-‚Ä¶   delimited-[]  k      C=\{[1],\dots,[k]\}   . Let    Œ£  k     subscript  normal-Œ£  k    \Sigma_{k}   denote the partition of     ‚ãÅ   j  =  0   n     œÉ   -  1     (  C  )        superscript   subscript     j  0    n      superscript  œÉ    1    C     \bigvee_{j=0}^{n}\sigma^{-1}(C)   into cylinders of length 1. Then    Œ£  k     subscript  normal-Œ£  k    \Sigma_{k}   is a partition of    n  ‚àà  ùí©      n  ùí©    n\in\mathcal{N}   for all    k  n     superscript  k  n    k^{n}   and the number of sets is   C   C   C   respectively. The partitions are open covers and     h   (  œÉ  )    =   h   (  œÉ  ,  C  )    =    lim   n  ‚Üí  ‚àû      1  n    log   k  n      =   log  k           h  œÉ     h   œÉ  C           subscript    normal-‚Üí  n         1  n      superscript  k  n             k      h(\sigma)=h(\sigma,C)=\lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}\frac{1}{n}\log k^{n}=\log k   is a topological generator. Hence       (   1  k   ,  ‚Ä¶  ,   1  k   )       1  k   normal-‚Ä¶    1  k     (\frac{1}{k},\dots,\frac{1}{k})   . The measure-theoretic entropy of the Bernoulli    log  k      k    \log k   -measure is also   A   A   A   . Hence it is a measure of maximal entropy. Further on it can be shown that no other measures of maximal entropy exist.   Let    k  √ó  k      k  k    k\times k   be an irreducible    {  0  ,  1  }     0  1    \{0,1\}   matrix with entries in    œÉ  :    Œ£  A   ‚Üí   Œ£  A       normal-:  œÉ   normal-‚Üí   subscript  normal-Œ£  A    subscript  normal-Œ£  A      \sigma:\Sigma_{A}\rightarrow\Sigma_{A}   and let     h   (  œÉ  )    =   log  Œª         h  œÉ     Œª     h(\sigma)=\log\lambda   be the corresponding subshift of finite type . Then   Œª   Œª   \lambda   where   A   A   A   is the largest positive eigenvalue of $A$ .
