Schur–Horn theorem

In mathematics, particularly linear algebra, the Schur–Horn theorem, named after Issai Schur and Alfred Horn, characterizes the diagonal of a Hermitian matrix with given eigenvalues. It has inspired investigations and substantial generalizations in the setting of symplectic geometry. A few important generalizations are Kostant's convexity theorem, Atiyah–Guillemin–Sternberg convexity theorem, Kirwan convexity theorem.

Permutation polytope generated by a vector
The permutation polytope generated by 
 
 
 
  denoted by 
 
 
 
  is defined as the convex hull of the set

  denotes the symmetric group on

Reformulation of Schur–Horn theorem
In view of the equivalence of (i) and (ii) in the lemma mentioned above, one may reformulate the theorem in the following manner.
Theorem. Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be real vectors. There is a Hermitian matrix with diagonal entries 
 
 
 
  and eigenvalues 
 
 
 
  if and only if the vector 
 
 
 
  is in the permutation polytope generated by 
 
 
 
 .
Note that in this formulation, one does not need to impose any ordering on the entries of the vectors 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Proof of the Schur–Horn theorem
Let 
 
 
 
  be a 
 
 
 
  Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 , counted with multiplicity. Denote the diagonal of 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 , thought of as a vector in 
 
 
 
 , and the vector 
 
 
 
  by 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the diagonal matrix having 
 
 
 
  on its diagonal.
(
 
 
 
 ) 
 
 
 
  may be written in the form 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  is a unitary matrix. Then



Let 
 
 
 
  be the matrix defined by 
 
 
 
 . Since 
 
 
 
  is a unitary matrix, 
 
 
 
  is a doubly stochastic matrix and we have 
 
 
 
 . By the Birkhoff–von Neumann theorem, 
 
 
 
  can be written as a convex combination of permutation matrices. Thus 
 
 
 
  is in the permutation polytope generated by 
 
 
 
 . This proves Schur's theorem.
(
 
 
 
 ) If 
 
 
 
  occurs as the diagonal of a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  also occurs as the diagonal of some Hermitian matrix with the same set of eigenvalues, for any transposition 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 . One may prove that in the following manner.
Let 
 
 
 
  be a complex number of modulus 
 
 
 
  such that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  be a unitary matrix with 
 
 
 
  in the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  entries, respectively, 
 
 
 
  at the 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  entries, respectively, 
 
 
 
  at all diagonal entries other than 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  at all other entries. Then 
 
 
 
  has 
 
 
 
  at the 
 
 
 
  entry, 
 
 
 
  at the 
 
 
 
  entry, and 
 
 
 
  at the 
 
 
 
  entry where 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be the transposition of 
 
 
 
  that interchanges 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 .
Then the diagonal of 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 .


 
  is a Hermitian matrix with eigenvalues 
 
 
 
 . Using the equivalence of (i) and (iii) in the lemma mentioned above, we see that any vector in the permutation polytope generated by 
 
 
 
 , occurs as the diagonal of a Hermitian matrix with the prescribed eigenvalues. This proves Horn's theorem.
Symplectic geometry perspective
The Schur–Horn theorem may be viewed as a corollary of the Atiyah–Guillemin–Sternberg convexity theorem in the following manner. Let 
 
 
 
  denote the group of 
 
 
 
  unitary matrices. Its Lie algebra, denoted by 
 
 
 
 , is the set of skew-Hermitian matrices. One may identify the dual space 
 
 
 
  with the set of Hermitian matrices 
 
 
 
  via the linear isomorphism 
 
 
 
  defined by 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 . The unitary group 
 
 
 
  acts on 
 
 
 
  by conjugation and acts on 
 
 
 
  by the coadjoint action. Under these actions, 
 
 
 
  is an 
 
 
 
 -equivariant map i.e. for every 
 
 
 
  the following diagram commutes,

Let 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  denote the diagonal matrix with entries given by 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  denote the orbit of 
 
 
 
  under the 
 
 
 
 -action i.e. conjugation. Under the 
 
 
 
 -equivariant isomorphism 
 
 
 
 , the symplectic structure on the corresponding coadjoint orbit may be brought onto 
 
 
 
 . Thus 
 
 
 
  is a Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
 -manifold.
Let 
 
 
 
  denote the Cartan subgroup of 
 
 
 
  which consists of diagonal complex matrices with diagonal entries of modulus 
 
 
 
 . The Lie algebra 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  consists of diagonal skew-Hermitian matrices and the dual space 
 
 
 
  consists of diagonal Hermitian matrices, under the isomorphism 
 
 
 
 . In other words, 
 
 
 
  consists of diagonal matrices with purely imaginary entries and 
 
 
 
  consists of diagonal matrices with real entries. The inclusion map 
 
 
 
  induces a map 
 
 
 
 , which projects a matrix 
 
 
 
  to the diagonal matrix with the same diagonal entries as 
 
 
 
 . The set 
 
 
 
  is a Hamiltonian 
 
 
 
 -manifold, and the restriction of 
 
 
 
  to this set is a moment map for this action.
By the Atiyah–Guillemin–Sternberg theorem, 
 
 
 
  is a convex polytope. A matrix 
 
 
 
  is fixed under conjugation by every element of 
 
 
 
  if and only if 
 
 
 
  is diagonal. The only diagonal matrices in 
 
 
 
  are the ones with diagonal entries 
 
 
 
  in some order. Thus, these matrices generate the convex polytope 
 
 
 
 . This is exactly the statement of the Schur–Horn theorem.
