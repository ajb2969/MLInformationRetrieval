   (31345) 1998 PG      (31345) 1998 PG   (31345) 1998 PG is a near-earth object discovered by the LONEOS program on August 3, 1998. It is known to have a moon , S/2001 (31345) 1. 1  Status as a Near-Earth Object  1998 PG is classified as an Amor asteroid . It has made multiple close approaches to Earth , with the closest being  on 15 October 1978. 2  Moon  1998 PG has a single moon , S/2001 (31345) 1. The moon was discovered at the Table Mountain Observatory by analyzing observations from 29 August to 25 October 1998. S/2001 (31345) 1 has a size of , one-third the size of the asteroid itself, and orbits every 14 hours with a semi-major axis of . 3 From the surface of 1998 PG, the moon would have an angular diameter of about 16.3°. 4 For comparison, the Sun appears to be 0.5° from Earth.
