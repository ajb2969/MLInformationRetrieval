   Collision problem      Collision problem   The r-to-1 collision problem is an important theoretical problem in complexity theory , quantum computing , and computational mathematics . The collision problem most often refers to the 2-to-1 version: 1 given   n   n   n   even and a function    f  :    {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }   →   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }       normal-:  f   normal-→   1  normal-…  n    1  normal-…  n      f:\,\{1,\ldots,n\}\rightarrow\{1,\ldots,n\}   , we are promised that f is either 1-to-1 or 2-to-1. We are only allowed to make queries about the value of    f   (  i  )       f  i    f(i)   for any    i  ∈   {  1  ,  …  ,  n  }       i   1  normal-…  n     i\in\{1,\ldots,n\}   . The problem then asks how many such queries we need to make to determine with certainty whether f is 1-to-1 or 2-to-1.  Classical Solutions  Deterministic  Solving the 2-to-1 version deterministically requires     n  /  2   +  1        n  2   1    n/2+1   queries, and in general distinguishing r-to-1 functions from 1-to-1 functions requires     n  /  r   +  1        n  r   1    n/r+1   queries.  This is a straightforward application of the pigeonhole principle : if a function is r-to-1, then after     n  /  r   +  1        n  r   1    n/r+1   queries we are guaranteed to have found a collision. If a function is 1-to-1, then no collision exists. Thus,     n  /  r   +  1        n  r   1    n/r+1   queries suffice. If we are unlucky, then the first    n  /  r      n  r    n/r   queries could return distinct answers, so     n  /  r   +  1        n  r   1    n/r+1   queries is also necessary.  Randomized  If we allow randomness, the problem is easier. By the birthday paradox , if we choose (distinct) queries at random, then with high probability we find a collision in any fixed 2-to-1 function after    Θ   (   n   )       normal-Θ    n     \Theta(\sqrt{n})   queries.  Quantum Solution  The BHT algorithm , which uses Grover's algorithm , solves this problem optimally using by only making    O   (   n   1  /  3    )       O   superscript  n    1  3      O(n^{1/3})   queries to f .
