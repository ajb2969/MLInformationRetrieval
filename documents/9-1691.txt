Collision problem

The r-to-1 collision problem is an important theoretical problem in complexity theory, quantum computing, and computational mathematics. The collision problem most often refers to the 2-to-1 version:1 given 
 
 
 
  even and a function 
 
 
 
 , we are promised that f is either 1-to-1 or 2-to-1. We are only allowed to make queries about the value of 
 
 
 
  for any 
 
 
 
 . The problem then asks how many such queries we need to make to determine with certainty whether f is 1-to-1 or 2-to-1.
Classical Solutions
Deterministic
Solving the 2-to-1 version deterministically requires 
 
 
 
  queries, and in general distinguishing r-to-1 functions from 1-to-1 functions requires 
 
 
 
  queries.
This is a straightforward application of the pigeonhole principle: if a function is r-to-1, then after 
 
 
 
  queries we are guaranteed to have found a collision. If a function is 1-to-1, then no collision exists. Thus, 
 
 
 
  queries suffice. If we are unlucky, then the first 
 
 
 
  queries could return distinct answers, so 
 
 
 
  queries is also necessary.
Randomized
If we allow randomness, the problem is easier. By the birthday paradox, if we choose (distinct) queries at random, then with high probability we find a collision in any fixed 2-to-1 function after 
 
 
 
  queries.
Quantum Solution
The BHT algorithm, which uses Grover's algorithm, solves this problem optimally using by only making 
 
 
 
  queries to f.
