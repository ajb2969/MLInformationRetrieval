   Phosphogluconate 2-dehydrogenase      Phosphogluconate 2-dehydrogenase   In enzymology , a phosphogluconate 2-dehydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   6-phospho-D-gluconate + NAD(P) +    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   6-phospho-2-dehydro-D-gluconate + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 6-phospho-D-gluconic acid , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are 6-phospho-2-dehydro-D-gluconic acid , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with NAD + or NADP + as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-phospho-D-gluconate:NAD(P) + 2-oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include 6-phosphogluconic dehydrogenase , phosphogluconate dehydrogenase , gluconate 6-phosphate dehydrogenase , 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (NAD + ) , and 2-keto-6-phosphogluconate reductase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway and glutathione metabolism.
