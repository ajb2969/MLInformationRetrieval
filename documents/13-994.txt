   Two-electron atom      Two-electron atom   In atomic physics , a two-electron atom or helium-like ion is a quantum mechanical system consisting of one nucleus with a charge of Z e and just two electrons. This is the first case of many-electron systems where the Pauli exclusion principle plays a central role.  It is an example of a three-body problem .  The first few two-electron atoms are:      Z =1:   H −   hydrogen anion     Z =2:   He   helium atom     Z =3:   Li +   lithium ion     Z =4:   Be 2+   beryllium ion     Z =5:   B 3+   boron ion       Schrödinger equation  The Schrödinger equation for any two-electron system, such as the neutral Helium atom (He, Z = 2), the negative Hydrogen  ion (H − , Z = 1), or the positive Lithium ion (Li + , Z = 3) is: 1 For a more rigorous mathematical derivation of Schrödinger's equation, see also. 2       E  ψ   =    -    ℏ  2    [     1   2  μ     (    ∇  1  2   +   ∇  2  2    )    +     1  M    ∇  1    ⋅   ∇  2     ]   ψ    +     e  2    4  π   ϵ  0      [    1   r  12    -   Z   (    1   r  1    +   1   r  2     )     ]   ψ          E  ψ          superscript  Planck-constant-over-2-pi  2    delimited-[]        1    2  μ       superscript   subscript  normal-∇  1   2    superscript   subscript  normal-∇  2   2      normal-⋅      1  M    subscript  normal-∇  1     subscript  normal-∇  2      ψ         superscript  e  2     4  π   subscript  ϵ  0      delimited-[]      1   subscript  r  12      Z      1   subscript  r  1      1   subscript  r  2        ψ      E\psi=-\hbar^{2}\left[\frac{1}{2\mu}\left(\nabla_{1}^{2}+\nabla_{2}^{2}\right)%

The wavefunction is a function of the two electron's positions:      ψ  =   ψ   (   𝕣  1   ,   𝕣  2   )        ψ    ψ    subscript  𝕣  1    subscript  𝕣  2       \psi=\psi(\mathbb{r}_{1},\mathbb{r}_{2})     There is no closed form solution for this equation.  Spectrum  The optical spectrum of the two electron atom has two systems of lines. A para system of single lines, and an ortho system of triplets (closely spaced group of three lines). The energy levels in the atom for the single lines are indicated by 1 S 0  1 P 1  1 D 2  1 F 3 etc., and for the triplets, some energy levels are split: 3 S 1  3 P 2  3 P 1  3 P 0  3 D 3  3 D 2  3 D 1  3 F 4  3 F 3  3 F 2 . 3  Alkaline earths and mercury also have spectra with similar features, due to the two outer valence electrons. 4  See also   Hydrogen-like atom  Helium atom   References  "  Category:Atoms  Category:Quantum models     Physics of Atoms and Molecules, B.H.
