   Hata model for urban areas      Hata model for urban areas   In wireless communication , the Hata model for urban areas , also known as the Okumura–Hata model for being a developed version of the Okumura model , is the most widely used radio frequency propagation model for predicting the behaviour of cellular transmissions in built up areas. This model incorporates the graphical information from Okumura model and develops it further to realize the effects of diffraction, reflection and scattering caused by city structures. This model also has two more varieties for transmission in suburban areas and open areas . 1  Hata Model predicts the total path loss along a link of terrestrial microwave or other type of cellular communications.  Applicable to/under conditions  This particular version of the Hata model is applicable to the radio propagation within urban areas.  This model is suited for both point-to-point and broadcast transmissions and it is based on extensive empirical measurements taken.  PCS is another extension of the Hata model. The Walfisch and Bertoni model is further advanced.  Coverage  Frequency : 150–1500 MHz  Mobile Station  Antenna Height: 1–10 m  Base station  Antenna Height: 30–200 m  Link distance: 1–10 km.  Mathematical formulation  The Hata model for urban areas is formulated as following:        L  U    =      69.55   +    26.16     log  10    f      -    13.82     log  10     h  B      -    C  H     +    [    44.9   -    6.55     log  10    h  B      ]     log  10   d          subscript  L  U         69.55    26.16    subscript   10   f       13.82    subscript   10    subscript  h  B      subscript  C  H       delimited-[]    44.9    6.55    subscript   10    subscript  h  B         subscript   10   d       L_{U}\;=\;69.55\;+\;26.16\;\log_{10}f\;-\;13.82\;\log_{10}h_{B}\;-\;C_{H}\;+\;%

Limitations  Though based on the Okumura model, the Hata model does not provide coverage to the whole range of frequencies covered by Okumura model. Hata model does not go beyond 1500 MHz while Okumura provides support for up to 1920 MHz.
