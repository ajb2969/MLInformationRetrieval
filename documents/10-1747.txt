   Dihydroxyphenylalanine ammonia-lyase      Dihydroxyphenylalanine ammonia-lyase   In enzymology , a dihydroxyphenylalanine ammonia-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   trans-caffeate + NH 3    Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine (L-DOPA), and two products , trans-caffeate and NH 3 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically ammonia lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (trans-caffeate-forming) . Other names in common use include beta-(3,4-dihydroxyphenyl)-L-alanine (DOPA) ammonia-lyase , and 3,4-dihydroxy-L-phenylalanine ammonia-lyase . This enzyme participates in tyrosine metabolism .
