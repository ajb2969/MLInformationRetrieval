   Essential spectrum      Essential spectrum   In mathematics , the essential spectrum of a bounded operator is a certain subset of its spectrum , defined by a condition of the type that says, roughly speaking, "fails badly to be invertible".  The essential spectrum of self-adjoint operators  In formal terms, let X be a Hilbert space and let T be a bounded  self-adjoint operator on X .  Definition  The essential spectrum of T , usually denoted σ ess ( T ), is the set of all complex numbers λ such that        λ   I   -  T        λ  I   T    \lambda\,I-T     is not a Fredholm operator .  Here, an operator is Fredholm if its range is closed and its kernel and cokernel are finite-dimensional. Furthermore, I denotes the identity operator on X , so that I ( x ) = x for all x in X .  Properties  The essential spectrum is always closed , and it is a subset of the spectrum . Since T is self-adjoint, the spectrum is contained on the real axis.  The essential spectrum is invariant under compact perturbations. That is, if K is a compact self-adjoint operator on X , then the essential spectra of T and that of T + K coincide. This explains why it is called the essential spectrum: Weyl (1910) originally defined the essential spectrum of a certain differential operator to be the spectrum independent of boundary conditions.  Weyl's criterion for the essential spectrum is as follows. First, a number λ is in the spectrum of T if and only if there exists a sequence {ψ k } in the space X such that ||ψ k || = 1 and        lim   k  →  ∞     ∥    T   ψ  k    -   λ   ψ  k     ∥    =  0.        subscript    normal-→  k      norm      T   subscript  ψ  k      λ   subscript  ψ  k       0.    \lim_{k\to\infty}\left\|T\psi_{k}-\lambda\psi_{k}\right\|=0.     Furthermore, λ is in the essential spectrum if there is a sequence satisfying this condition, but such that it contains no convergent subsequence (this is the case if, for example    {   ψ  k   }      subscript  ψ  k     \{\psi_{k}\}   is an orthonormal sequence); such a sequence is called a singular sequence .  The discrete spectrum  The essential spectrum is a subset of the spectrum σ, and its complement is called the discrete spectrum , so         σ  discr    (  T  )    =    σ   (  T  )    ∖    σ  ess    (  T  )      .         subscript  σ  discr   T       σ  T      subscript  σ  ess   T      \sigma_{\mathrm{discr}}(T)=\sigma(T)\setminus\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}}(T).   A number λ is in the discrete spectrum if it is an isolated eigenvalue of finite multiplicity, meaning that the dimension of the space      {   ψ  ∈  X   :    T  ψ   =   λ  ψ    }     conditional-set    ψ  X       T  ψ     λ  ψ      \{\psi\in X:T\psi=\lambda\psi\}   is finite but non-zero and that there is an ε > 0 such that μ ∈ σ( T ) and |μ−λ| ess,1( T ) is the set of all λ such that λI − T is not semi-Fredholm (an operator is semi-Fredholm if its range is closed and its kernel or its cokernel is finite-dimensional).   The essential spectrum σ ess,2 ( T ) is the set of all λ such that the range of λI − T is not closed or the kernel of λI − T is infinite-dimensional.  The essential spectrum σ ess,3 ( T ) is the set of all λ such that λI − T is not Fredholm (an operator is Fredholm if its range is closed and both its kernel and its cokernel are finite-dimensional).  The essential spectrum σ ess,4 ( T ) is the set of all λ such that λI − T is not Fredholm with index zero (the index of a Fredholm operator is the difference between the dimension of the kernel and the dimension of the cokernel).  The essential spectrum σ ess,5 ( T ) is the union of σ ess,1 ( T ) with all components of C \ σ ess,1 ( T ) that do not intersect with the resolvent set C \ σ( T ).   The essential spectrum of an operator is closed, whatever definition is used. Furthermore,         σ   ess  ,  1     (  T  )    ⊂    σ   ess  ,  2     (  T  )    ⊂    σ   ess  ,  3     (  T  )    ⊂    σ   ess  ,  4     (  T  )    ⊂    σ   ess  ,  5     (  T  )    ⊂   σ   (  T  )    ⊂  𝐂   ,           subscript  σ   ess  1    T      subscript  σ   ess  2    T           subscript  σ   ess  3    T           subscript  σ   ess  4    T           subscript  σ   ess  5    T          σ  T        𝐂     \sigma_{\mathrm{ess},1}(T)\subset\sigma_{\mathrm{ess},2}(T)\subset\sigma_{%
 \mathrm{ess},3}(T)\subset\sigma_{\mathrm{ess},4}(T)\subset\sigma_{\mathrm{ess}%
 ,5}(T)\subset\sigma(T)\subset\mathbf{C},   but any of these inclusions may be strict. However, for self-adjoint operators, all the above definitions for the essential spectrum coincide.  Define the radius of the essential spectrum by         r   ess  ,  k     (  T  )    =   max   {    |  λ  |   :   λ  ∈    σ   ess  ,  k     (  T  )      }     .         subscript  r   ess  k    T      normal-:    λ     λ     subscript  σ   ess  k    T        r_{\mathrm{ess},k}(T)=\max\{|\lambda|:\lambda\in\sigma_{\mathrm{ess},k}(T)\}.   Even though the spectra may be different, the radius is the same for all k .  The essential spectrum σ ess, k ( T ) is invariant under compact perturbations for k = 1,2,3,4, but not for k = 5. The case k = 4 gives the part of the spectrum that is independent of compact perturbations, that is,         σ   ess  ,  4     (  T  )    =    ⋂   K  ∈   K   (  X  )       σ   (   T  +  K   )      ,         subscript  σ   ess  4    T     subscript     K    K  X       σ    T  K       \sigma_{\mathrm{ess},4}(T)=\bigcap_{K\in K(X)}\sigma(T+K),   where K ( X ) denotes the set of compact operators on X .  The second definition generalizes Weyl's criterion: σ ess,2 ( T ) is the set of all λ for which there is no singular sequence.
