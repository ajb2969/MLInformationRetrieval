   Hilbert class field      Hilbert class field   In algebraic number theory , the Hilbert class field  E of a number field  K is the maximal abelian  unramified extension of K . Its degree over K equals the class number of K and the Galois group of E over K is canonically isomorphic to the ideal class group of K using Frobenius elements for prime ideals in K .  In this context, the Hilbert class field of K is not just unramified at the finite places (the classical ideal theoretic interpretation) but also at the infinite places of K . That is, every real embedding of K extends to a real embedding of E (rather than to a complex embedding of E ).  Examples   If the ring of integers of K is a unique factorization domain , in particular, if    K  =  ℚ      K  ℚ    K=\mathbb{Q}   then K is its own Hilbert class field.    Let    K  =   ℚ   (    -  15    )        K    ℚ      15       K=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-15})   of discriminant 15. The field    L  =   ℚ   (    -  3    ,   5   )        L    ℚ       3      5       L=\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{-3},\sqrt{5})   has discriminant 225=15 2 and so is an everywhere unramified extension of K , and it is abelian. Using the Minkowski bound , one can show that K has class number 2. Hence, its Hilbert class field is   L   L   L   . A non-principal ideal of K is (2,(1+√−15)/2), and in L this becomes the principal ideal ((1+√5)/2).    To see why ramification at the archimedean primes must be taken into account, consider the real  quadratic field  K obtained by adjoining the square root of 3 to Q . This field has class number 1 and discriminant 3, but the extension K ( i )/ K of discriminant 9=3 2 is unramified at all prime ideals in K , so K admits finite abelian extensions of degree greater than 1 in which all finite primes of K are unramified. This doesn't contradict the Hilbert class field of K being K itself: every proper finite abelian extension of K must ramify at some place, and in the extension K ( i )/ K there is ramification at the archimedean places: the real embeddings of K extend to complex (rather than real) embeddings of K ( i ).    By the theory of complex multiplication , the Hilbert class field of an imaginary quadratic field is generated by the value of the elliptic modular function at a generator for the ring of integers (as a Z -module).   History  The existence of a (narrow) Hilbert class field for a given number field K was conjectured by  and proved by Philipp Furtwängler . 1 The existence of the Hilbert class field is a valuable tool in studying the structure of the ideal class group of a given field.  Additional properties  The Hilbert class field E also satisfies the following:   E is a finite Galois extension of K and [ E :'' K ]= h'' K , where h K is the class number of K .  The ideal class group of K is isomorphic to the Galois group of E over K .  Every ideal of O K is a principal ideal of the ring extension O E ( principal ideal theorem ).  Every prime ideal  P of O K decomposes into the product of h K / f prime ideals in O E , where f is the order of [ P ] in the ideal class group of O K .   In fact, E is the unique field satisfying the first, second, and fourth properties.  Explicit constructions  If K is imaginary quadratic and A is an elliptic curve with complex multiplication by the ring of integers of K , then adjoining the j-invariant of A to K gives the Hilbert class field. 2  Generalizations  In class field theory , one studies the ray class field with respect to a given modulus , which is a formal product of prime ideals (including, possibly, archimedean ones). The ray class field is the maximal abelian extension unramified outside the primes dividing the modulus and satisfying a particular ramification condition at the primes dividing the modulus. The Hilbert class field is then the ray class field with respect to the trivial modulus 1 .  The narrow class field is the ray class field with respect to the modulus consisting of all infinite primes. For example, the argument above shows that    ℚ   (   3   ,  i  )       ℚ     3   i     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3},i)   is the narrow class field of    ℚ   (   3   )       ℚ    3     \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{3})   .
