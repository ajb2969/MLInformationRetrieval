Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem

In mathematics, the Prouhet–Tarry–Escott problem asks for two disjoint sets A and B of n integers each, such that:



for each integer i from 1 to a given k.1
This problem was named after Eugène Prouhet, who studied it in the early 1850s, and Gaston Tarry and Escott, who studied it in the early 1910s. The problem originates from letters of Christian Goldbach and Leonhard Euler (1750/1751).
Examples
It has been shown that n must be strictly greater than k. The largest value of k for which a solution with n = k+1 is known is given by A = {±22, ±61, ±86, ±127, ±140, ±151}, B = {±35, ±47, ±94, ±121, ±146, ±148} for which k = 11.2
An example for n = 6 and k = 5 is given by the two sets { 0, 5, 6, 16, 17, 22 } and { 1, 2, 10, 12, 20, 21 }, because:

01 + 51 + 61 + 161 + 171 + 221 = 11 + 21 + 101 + 121 + 201 + 211



02 + 52 + 62 + 162 + 172 + 222 = 12 + 22 + 102 + 122 + 202 + 212



03 + 53 + 63 + 163 + 173 + 223 = 13 + 23 + 103 + 123 + 203 + 213



04 + 54 + 64 + 164 + 174 + 224 = 14 + 24 + 104 + 124 + 204 + 214



05 + 55 + 65 + 165 + 175 + 225 = 15 + 25 + 105 + 125 + 205 + 215.
 

Generalizations
A higher dimensional version of the Prouhet-Tarry-Escott problem has been introduced and studied by Andreas Alpers and Robert Tijdeman in 2007: Given parameters
