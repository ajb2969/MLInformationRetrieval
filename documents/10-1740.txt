   Cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase      Cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase   In enzymology , a cysteine-S-conjugate beta-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   RS-CH 2 -CH(NH 3 +)COO-   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   RSH + NH 3 + pyruvate   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , RS-CH 2 -CH(NH 3 +)COO- , but 3 products : RSH , NH 3 , and pyruvate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically the class of carbon-sulfur lyases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-cysteine-S-conjugate thiol-lyase (deaminating; pyruvate-forming) . Other names in common use include cysteine conjugate beta-lyase , glutamine transaminase K/cysteine conjugate beta-lyase , and L-cysteine-S-conjugate thiol-lyase (deaminating) . It employs one cofactor , pyridoxal phosphate .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 3 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , and .
