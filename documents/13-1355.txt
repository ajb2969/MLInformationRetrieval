   Estrada index      Estrada index   In chemical graph theory , the Estrada index is a topological index of protein folding . The index was first defined by Ernesto Estrada as a measure of the degree of folding of a protein, 1 which is represented as a path-graph weighted by the dihedral or torsional angles of the protein backbone. This index of degree of folding has found multiple applications in the study of protein functions and protein-ligand interactions .  The name of this index as the “Estrada index” was proposed by de la Peña et al. in 2007. 2  Derivation  Let    G  =   (  V  ,  E  )       G   V  E     G=(V,E)   be a graph of size     |  V  |   =  n        V   n    |V|=n   and let     λ  1   ≥   λ  2   ≥  …  ≥   λ  n          subscript  λ  1    subscript  λ  2        normal-…        subscript  λ  n      \lambda_{1}\geq\lambda_{2}\geq...\geq\lambda_{n}   be a non-increasing ordering of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix   A   A   A   . The Estrada index is defined as       E  E   (  G  )    =    ∑   j  =  1   n    e   λ  j           E  E  G     superscript   subscript     j  1    n    superscript  e   subscript  λ  j       EE(G)=\sum_{j=1}^{n}e^{\lambda_{j}}     For a general graph, the index can be obtained as the sum of the subgraph centralities of all nodes in the graph. The subgraph centrality of node   i   i   i   is defined as 3      E  E   (  i  )    =    ∑   k  =  0   ∞      (   A  k   )    i  i     k  !           E  E  i     superscript   subscript     k  0         subscript   superscript  A  k     i  i      k       EE(i)=\sum_{k=0}^{\infty}\frac{(A^{k})_{ii}}{k!}     The subgraph centrality has the following closed form 4      E  E   (  i  )    =    (   e  A   )    i  i    =    ∑   j  =  1   n      [   φ   (  i  )    ]   2    e   λ  j              E  E  i    subscript   superscript  e  A     i  i           superscript   subscript     j  1    n      superscript   delimited-[]    φ  i    2    superscript  e   subscript  λ  j         EE(i)=(e^{A})_{ii}=\sum_{j=1}^{n}[\varphi(i)]^{2}e^{\lambda_{j}}     where     φ  j    (  i  )        subscript  φ  j   i    \varphi_{j}(i)   is the   i   i   i   th entry of the   j   j   j   th eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue    λ  j     subscript  λ  j    \lambda_{j}   . It is straightforward to realise that 5      E  E   (  G  )    =   t  r   (   e  A   )          E  E  G     t  r   superscript  e  A      EE(G)=tr(e^{A})     References     "  Category:Mathematical chemistry  Category:Cheminformatics  Category:Graph invariants     ↩  ↩  ↩
