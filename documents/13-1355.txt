Estrada index

In chemical graph theory, the Estrada index is a topological index of protein folding. The index was first defined by Ernesto Estrada as a measure of the degree of folding of a protein,1 which is represented as a path-graph weighted by the dihedral or torsional angles of the protein backbone. This index of degree of folding has found multiple applications in the study of protein functions and protein-ligand interactions.
The name of this index as the “Estrada index” was proposed by de la Peña et al. in 2007.2
Derivation
Let 
 
 
 
  be a graph of size
 
 
 
  and let 
 
 
 
  be a non-increasing ordering of the eigenvalues of its adjacency matrix 
 
 
 
  . The Estrada index is defined as



For a general graph, the index can be obtained as the sum of the subgraph centralities of all nodes in the graph. The subgraph centrality of node 
 
 
 
  is defined as3


The subgraph centrality has the following closed form4


where 
 
 
 
  is the 
 
 
 
  th entry of the 
 
 
 
 th eigenvector associated with the eigenvalue 
 
 
 
  . It is straightforward to realise that5
