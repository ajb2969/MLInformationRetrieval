   Photon diffusion equation      Photon diffusion equation   Photon diffusion equation is a second order partial differential equation describing the time behavior of photon fluence rate distribution in a low-absorption high-scattering medium.  Its mathematical form is as follows.         ∇   (    D   (  r  )    ⋅  ∇   )    Φ    (   r  →   ,  t  )    -   v   μ  a    (   r  →   )   Φ   (   r  →   ,  t  )     +   v  S   (   r  →   ,  t  )     =     ∂  Φ    (   r  →   ,  t  )     ∂  t                normal-∇   normal-⋅    D  r   normal-∇    normal-Φ     normal-→  r   t      v   subscript  μ  a    normal-→  r   normal-Φ    normal-→  r   t       v  S    normal-→  r   t           normal-Φ     normal-→  r   t      t      \nabla(D(r)\cdot\nabla)\Phi(\vec{r},t)-v\mu_{a}(\vec{r})\Phi(\vec{r},t)+vS(%
 \vec{r},t)=\frac{\partial\Phi(\vec{r},t)}{\partial t}   where   Φ   normal-Φ   \Phi   is photon fluence rate (W/cm 2 ),    μ  a     subscript  μ  a    \mu_{a}   is absorption coefficient (cm −1 ),   D   D   D   is diffusion constant ,   v   v   v   is the speed of light in the medium (m/s), and   S   S   S   is an isotropic source term (W/cm 3 ).  Its main difference with diffusion equation in physics is that photon diffusion equation has an absorption term in it.
