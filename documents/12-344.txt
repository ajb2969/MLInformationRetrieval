Photon diffusion equation




Photon diffusion equation

Photon diffusion equation is a second order partial differential equation describing the time behavior of photon fluence rate distribution in a low-absorption high-scattering medium.
Its mathematical form is as follows. 
 
 
 
  where 
 
 
 
  is photon fluence rate (W/cm2), 
 
 
 
  is absorption coefficient (cmâˆ’1), 
 
 
 
  is diffusion constant, 
 
 
 
  is the speed of light in the medium (m/s), and 
 
 
 
  is an isotropic source term (W/cm3).
Its main difference with diffusion equation in physics is that photon diffusion equation has an absorption term in it.
