(glutamate—ammonia-ligase) adenylyltransferase




(glutamate—ammonia-ligase) adenylyltransferase

In enzymology, a [glutamate—ammonia-ligase] adenylyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + [L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)] 
 
 
 
  diphosphate + adenylyl-[L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)]
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming), whereas its two products are diphosphate and adenylyl-[L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)].
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing nucleotide groups (nucleotidyltransferases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:[L-glutamate:ammonia ligase (ADP-forming)] adenylyltransferase. Other names in common use include glutamine-synthetase adenylyltransferase, ATP:glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase, and adenosine triphosphate:glutamine synthetase adenylyltransferase.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
