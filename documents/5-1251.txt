   Thresholding (image processing)      Thresholding (image processing)    Thresholding is the simplest method of image segmentation . From a grayscale image, thresholding can be used to create binary images  (Shapiro, et al. 2001:83) .  Definition  The simplest thresholding methods replace each pixel in an image with a black pixel if the image intensity    I   i  ,  j      subscript  I   i  j     I_{i,j}   is less than some fixed constant T (that is, $I_{i,j} ), or a white pixel if the image intensity is greater than that constant.  In the example image on the right, this results in the dark tree becoming completely black, and the white snow becoming complete white.
 
 ==Categorizing thresholding Methods==
 
 To make thresholding completely automated, it is necessary for the computer to automatically select the threshold T.  Sezgin and Sankur (2004) categorize thresholding methods into the following six groups based on the information the algorithm manipulates [[#Sezgin2004|(Sezgin et al., 2004)]]:
 
 * '''[[Histogram]] shape'''-based methods, where, for example, the peaks, valleys and curvatures of the smoothed histogram are analyzed
 * '''Clustering'''-based methods, where the gray-level samples are clustered in two parts as background and foreground (object), or alternately are modeled as a mixture of two Gaussians
 * '''[[Entropy (information theory) | Entropy]]'''-based methods result in algorithms that use the entropy of the foreground and background regions, the cross-entropy between the original and binarized image, etc.
 * '''Object Attribute'''-based methods search a measure of similarity between the gray-level and the binarized images, such as fuzzy shape similarity, edge coincidence, etc.
 * '''Spatial''' methods [that] use higher-order probability distribution and/or correlation between pixels
 * '''Local''' methods adapt the threshold value on each pixel to the local image characteristics.  In these methods, a different T is selected for each pixel in the image.
 
 ==Multiband thresholding==
 
 Colour images can also be thresholded. One approach is to designate a separate threshold for each of the [[RGB color model|RGB]] components of the image and then combine them with an [[Binary and|AND]] operation. This reflects the way the camera works and how the data is stored in the computer, but it does not correspond to the way that people recognize colour. Therefore, the [[HSL and HSV]] colour models are more often used; note that since [[hue]] is a circular quantity it requires circular thresholding. It is also possible to use the [[CMYK color model|CMYK]] colour model [[#Pham2007|(Pham et al., 2007)]].
 
 == Probability distributions ==
 
 Histogram shape-based methods in particular, but also many other thresholding algorithms, make certain assumptions about the image intensity probability distribution. The most common thresholding methods work on bimodal distributions, but algorithms have also been developed for [[Unimodal thresholding|unimodal distributions]], multimodal distributions, and [[Circular thresholding|circular distributions]].
