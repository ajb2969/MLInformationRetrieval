   ASUI      ASUI   The Average Service Unavailability Index (ASUI) 1 is a reliability index commonly used by electric power  utilities . It is calculated as      ASUI  =     ∑    U  i    N  i        ∑    N  i   ×  8760      =   1  -  ASAI         ASUI         subscript  U  i    subscript  N  i          subscript  N  i   8760            1  ASAI      \mbox{ASUI}=\frac{\sum{U_{i}N_{i}}}{\sum{N_{i}}\times 8760}=1-\mbox{ASAI}     where    N  i     subscript  N  i    N_{i}   is the number of customers and    U  i     subscript  U  i    U_{i}   is the annual outage time (in hours) for location   i   i   i   . ASUI can be represented in relation to SAIDI (where annual SAIDI is given in hours) as      ASUI  =   SAIDI  8760       ASUI    SAIDI  8760     \mbox{ASUI}=\frac{\mbox{SAIDI}}{8760}     See also   ASAI  ASIDI  ASIFI  ASUI  CAIDI  CAIFI  CTAIDI  MAIFI  SAIDI  SAIFI   References  "  Category:Electric power distribution  Category:Reliability analysis     ↩
