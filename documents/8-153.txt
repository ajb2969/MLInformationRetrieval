   Coherent risk measure      Coherent risk measure   In the field of financial economics there are a number of ways that risk can be defined; to clarify the concept theoreticians have described a number of properties that a risk measure might or might not have. A coherent risk measure is a function   œ±   œ±   \varrho   that satisfies properties of monotonicity , sub-additivity , homogeneity , and translational invariance .  Properties  Consider a random outcome   X   X   X   viewed as an element of a linear space   ‚Ñí   ‚Ñí   \mathcal{L}   of measurable functions, defined on an appropriate probability space. A functional     œ±  :  ‚Ñí     normal-:  œ±  ‚Ñí    \varrho:\mathcal{L}   ‚Üí     \R   ‚à™   {   +  ‚àû   }       \R          \R\cup\{+\infty\}   is said to be coherent risk measure for   ‚Ñí   ‚Ñí   \mathcal{L}   if it satisfies the following properties: 1   Normalized       œ±   (  0  )    =  0        œ±  0   0    \varrho(0)=0      That is, the risk of holding no assets is zero.   Monotonicity       If    Z  1   ,   Z  2   ‚àà   ‚Ñí    and    Z  1   ‚â§    Z  2    a  .  s  .  ,   then   œ±   (   Z  1   )   ‚â•  œ±   (   Z  2   )      fragments  If   subscript  Z  1   normal-,   subscript  Z  2    L  and   subscript  Z  1     subscript  Z  2   a  normal-.  s  normal-.  normal-,  then  œ±   fragments  normal-(   subscript  Z  1   normal-)    œ±   fragments  normal-(   subscript  Z  2   normal-)     \mathrm{If}\;Z_{1},Z_{2}\in\mathcal{L}\;\mathrm{and}\;Z_{1}\leq Z_{2}\;\mathrm%
 {a.s.},\;\mathrm{then}\;\varrho(Z_{1})\geq\varrho(Z_{2})      That is, if portfolio    Z  2     subscript  Z  2    Z_{2}   always has better values than portfolio    Z  1     subscript  Z  1    Z_{1}   under almost all scenarios then the risk of    Z  2     subscript  Z  2    Z_{2}   should be less than the risk of    Z  1     subscript  Z  1    Z_{1}   . 2 E.g. If    Z  1     subscript  Z  1    Z_{1}   is an in the money call option (or otherwise) on a stock, and    Z  2     subscript  Z  2    Z_{2}   is also an in the money call option with a lower strike price.   Sub-additivity          If    Z  1    ,   Z  2    ‚àà  ‚Ñí   ,     then   œ±   (    Z  1   +   Z  2    )    ‚â§    œ±   (   Z  1   )    +   œ±   (   Z  2   )         formulae-sequence       If   subscript  Z  1     subscript  Z  2    ‚Ñí       then  œ±     subscript  Z  1    subscript  Z  2         œ±   subscript  Z  1      œ±   subscript  Z  2        \mathrm{If}\;Z_{1},Z_{2}\in\mathcal{L},\;\mathrm{then}\;\varrho(Z_{1}+Z_{2})%
 \leq\varrho(Z_{1})+\varrho(Z_{2})      Indeed, the risk of two portfolios together cannot get any worse than adding the two risks separately: this is the diversification principle.   Positive homogeneity         If   Œ±   ‚â•    0    and   Z   ‚àà  ‚Ñí   ,     then   œ±   (   Œ±  Z   )    =   Œ±  œ±   (  Z  )        formulae-sequence        If  Œ±     0  and  Z        ‚Ñí        then  œ±    Œ±  Z      Œ±  œ±  Z      \mathrm{If}\;\alpha\geq 0\;\mathrm{and}\;Z\in\mathcal{L},\;\mathrm{then}\;%
 \varrho(\alpha Z)=\alpha\varrho(Z)      Loosely speaking, if you double your portfolio then you double your risk.   Translation invariance   If   A   A   A   is a deterministic portfolio with guaranteed return   a   a   a   and    Z  ‚àà  ‚Ñí      Z  ‚Ñí    Z\in\mathcal{L}   then       œ±   (   Z  +  A   )    =    œ±   (  Z  )    -  a         œ±    Z  A        œ±  Z   a     \varrho(Z+A)=\varrho(Z)-a   The portofolio   A   A   A   is just adding cash   a   a   a   to your portfolio   Z   Z   Z   . In particular, if    a  =   œ±   (  Z  )        a    œ±  Z     a=\varrho(Z)   then     œ±   (   Z  +  A   )    =  0        œ±    Z  A    0    \varrho(Z+A)=0   .  Convex risk measures  The notion of coherence has been subsequently relaxed. Indeed, the notions of Sub-additivity and Positive Homogeneity can be replaced by the notion of convexity : 3   Convexity        If   Z  1    ,   Z  2    ‚àà   ‚Ñí  and  Œª   ‚àà    [  0  ,  1  ]   then  œ±   (    Œª   Z  1    +    (   1  -  Œª   )    Z  2     )    ‚â§    Œª  œ±   (   Z  1   )    +    (   1  -  Œª   )   œ±   (   Z  2   )              If   subscript  Z  1     subscript  Z  2      ‚Ñí  and  Œª           0  1   then  œ±      Œª   subscript  Z  1        1  Œª    subscript  Z  2               Œª  œ±   subscript  Z  1        1  Œª   œ±   subscript  Z  2        \text{If }Z_{1},Z_{2}\in\mathcal{L}\text{ and }\lambda\in[0,1]\text{ then }%
 \varrho(\lambda Z_{1}+(1-\lambda)Z_{2})\leq\lambda\varrho(Z_{1})+(1-\lambda)%
 \varrho(Z_{2})      General framework of Wang transform   Wang transform of the decumulative distribution function   A Wang transform of the decumulative distribution function is an increasing function    g  :    [  0  ,  1  ]   ‚Üí   [  0  ,  1  ]       normal-:  g   normal-‚Üí   0  1    0  1      g\colon[0,1]\rightarrow[0,1]   where     g   (  0  )    =  0        g  0   0    g(0)=0   and     g   (  1  )    =  1        g  1   1    g(1)=1   . 4 This function is called distortion function or Wang transform function.  The dual distortion function is      g  ~    (  x  )    =   1  -   g   (   1  -  x   )            normal-~  g   x     1    g    1  x       \tilde{g}(x)=1-g(1-x)   . 5 6 Given a probability space     (  Œ©  ,  ‚Ñ±  ,  ‚Ñô  )     normal-Œ©  ‚Ñ±  ‚Ñô    (\Omega,\mathcal{F},\mathbb{P})   , then for any random variable    X   X   X   and any distortion function   g   g   g   we can define a new probability measure    ‚Ñö   ‚Ñö   \mathbb{Q}   such that for any    A  ‚àà  ‚Ñ±      A  ‚Ñ±    A\in\mathcal{F}   it follows that    ‚Ñö   (  A  )   =  g   (  ‚Ñô   (  X  ‚àà  A  )   )   .     fragments  Q   fragments  normal-(  A  normal-)    g   fragments  normal-(  P   fragments  normal-(  X   A  normal-)   normal-)   normal-.    \mathbb{Q}(A)=g(\mathbb{P}(X\in A)).    7   Actuarial premium principle   For any increasing concave Wang transform function, we could define a corresponding premium principle : 8      œ±   (  X  )    =    ‚à´  0   +  ‚àû     g   (     F  ¬Ø   X    (  x  )    )   d  x          œ±  X     superscript   subscript   0          g     subscript   normal-¬Ø  F   X   x   d  x      \varrho(X)=\int_{0}^{+\infty}g\left(\bar{F}_{X}(x)\right)dx      Coherent risk measure   A coherent risk measure could be defined by a Wang transform of the decumulative distribution function   g   g   g   if on only if   g   g   g   is concave. 9  Examples of risk measure  Value at risk  It is well known that value at risk  is not , in general, a coherent risk measure as it does not respect the sub-additivity property. An immediate consequence is that value at risk might discourage diversification. 10  Value at risk is, however, coherent, under the assumption of elliptically distributed losses (e.g. normally distributed ) when the portfolio value is a linear function of the asset prices. However, in this case the value at risk becomes equivalent to a mean-variance approach where the risk of a portfolio is measured by the variance of the portfolio's return.  The Wang transform function (distortion function) for the Value at Risk is     g   (  x  )    =   ùüè   x  ‚â•   1  -  Œ±           g  x    subscript  1    x    1  Œ±       g(x)=\mathbf{1}_{x\geq 1-\alpha}   . The non-concavity of   g   g   g   proves the non coherence of this risk measure.   Illustration   As a simple example to demonstrate the non-coherence of value-at-risk consider looking at the VaR of a portfolio at 95% confidence over the next year of two default-able zero coupon bonds that mature in 1 years time denominated in our numeraire currency.  Assume the following:   The current yield on the two bonds is 0%  The two bonds are from different issuers  Each bonds has a 4% probability of defaulting over the next year  The event of default in either bond is independent of the other  Upon default the bonds have a recovery rate of 30%   Under these conditions the 95% VaR for holding either of the bonds is 0 since the probability of default is less than 5%. However if we held a portfolio that consisted of 50% of each bond by value then the 95% VaR is 35% since the probability of at least one of the bonds defaulting is 7.84% which exceeds 5%. This violates the sub-additivity property showing that VaR is not a coherent risk measure.  Average value at risk  The average value at risk (sometimes called expected shortfall or conditional value-at-risk) is a coherent risk measure, even though it is derived from Value at Risk which is not.  Entropic value at risk  The entropic value at risk is a coherent risk measure. 11  Tail value at risk  The tail value at risk (or tail conditional expectation) is a coherent risk measure only when the underlying distribution is continuous .  The Wang transform function (distortion function) for the tail value at risk is     g   (  x  )    =   min   (   x  Œ±   ,  1  )          g  x       x  Œ±   1     g(x)=\min(\frac{x}{\alpha},1)   . The concavity of   g   g   g   proves the coherence of this risk measure in the case of continuous distribution.  Proportional Hazard (PH) risk measure  The PH risk measure (or Proportional Hazard Risk measure) transforms the hasard rates    (    Œª   (  t  )    =     f   (  t  )      F  ¬Ø    (  t  )       )        Œª  t       f  t      normal-¬Ø  F   t      \scriptstyle\left(\lambda(t)=\frac{f(t)}{\bar{F}(t)}\right)   using a coefficient   Œæ   Œæ   \xi   .  The Wang transform function (distortion function) for the PH risk measure is      g  Œ±    (  x  )    =   x  Œæ          subscript  g  Œ±   x    superscript  x  Œæ     g_{\alpha}(x)=x^{\xi}   . The concavity of   g   g   g   if    Œæ  <    1  2        Œæ    1  2     \scriptstyle\xi<\frac{1}{2}   proves the coherence of this risk measure.  g-Entropic risk measures  g-entropic risk measures are a class of information-theoretic coherent risk measures that involve some important cases such as CVaR and EVaR. 12  The Wang risk measure  The Wang risk measure is define by the following Wang transform function (distortion function)      g  Œ±    (  x  )    =   Œ¶   [     Œ¶   -  1     (  x  )    -    Œ¶   -  1     (  Œ±  )     ]           subscript  g  Œ±   x     normal-Œ¶   delimited-[]       superscript  normal-Œ¶    1    x      superscript  normal-Œ¶    1    Œ±        g_{\alpha}(x)=\Phi\left[\Phi^{-1}(x)-\Phi^{-1}(\alpha)\right]   . The coherence of this risk measure is a consequence of the concavity of   g   g   g   .  Entropic risk measure  The entropic risk measure is a convex risk measure which is not coherent. It is related to the exponential utility .  Superhedging price  The superhedging price is a coherent risk measure.  Set-valued  In a situation with    ‚Ñù  d     superscript  ‚Ñù  d    \mathbb{R}^{d}   -valued portfolios such that risk can be measured in    n  ‚â§  d      n  d    n\leq d   of the assets, then a set of portfolios is the proper way to depict risk. Set-valued risk measures are useful for markets with transaction costs . 13  Properties  A set-valued coherent risk measure is a function    R  :    L  d  p   ‚Üí   ùîΩ  M       normal-:  R   normal-‚Üí   superscript   subscript  L  d   p    subscript  ùîΩ  M      R:L_{d}^{p}\rightarrow\mathbb{F}_{M}   , where     ùîΩ  M   =   {   D  ‚äÜ  M   :   D  =   c  l   (   D  +   K  M    )     }        subscript  ùîΩ  M    conditional-set    D  M     D    c  l    D   subscript  K  M         \mathbb{F}_{M}=\{D\subseteq M:D=cl(D+K_{M})\}   and     K  M   =   K  ‚à©  M        subscript  K  M     K  M     K_{M}=K\cap M   where   K   K   K   is a constant solvency cone and   M   M   M   is the set of portfolios of the   m   m   m   reference assets.   R   R   R   must have the following properties: 14   Normalized       K  M   ‚äÜ  R   (  0  )    and   R   (  0  )   ‚à©  -  int   K  M   =  ‚àÖ     fragments   subscript  K  M    R   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)   and  R   fragments  normal-(  0  normal-)     int   subscript  K  M       K_{M}\subseteq R(0)\;\mathrm{and}\;R(0)\cap-\mathrm{int}K_{M}=\emptyset       Translative in M         ‚àÄ  X   ‚àà   L  d  p    ,    ‚àÄ  u   ‚àà  M    :    R   (   X  +   u  1    )    =    R   (  X  )    -  u       normal-:   formulae-sequence     for-all  X    superscript   subscript  L  d   p       for-all  u   M        R    X    u  1         R  X   u      \forall X\in L_{d}^{p},\forall u\in M:R(X+u1)=R(X)-u       Monotone        ‚àÄ   X  2    -   X  1    ‚àà    L  d  p    (  K  )    ‚áí   R   (   X  2   )    ‚äá   R   (   X  1   )             for-all   subscript  X  2     subscript  X  1       superscript   subscript  L  d   p   K     normal-‚áí      R   subscript  X  2      superset-of-or-equals      R   subscript  X  1       \forall X_{2}-X_{1}\in L_{d}^{p}(K)\Rightarrow R(X_{2})\supseteq R(X_{1})       Sublinear   Set-valued convex risk measure  If instead of the sublinear property, R is convex, then R is a set-valued convex risk measure.
