   Flavonol-3-O-glycoside glucosyltransferase      Flavonol-3-O-glycoside glucosyltransferase   In enzymology , a flavonol-3-O-glycoside glucosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-glucose + a flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + a flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-glucose and flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside , whereas its 3 products are UDP , flavonol , and 3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-glucose:flavonol-3-O-beta-D-glucosyl-(1->2)-beta-D-glucoside 2 -O-beta-D-glucosyltransferase'''.
