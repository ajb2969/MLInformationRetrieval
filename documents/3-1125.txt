   Poise      Poise   The poise (symbol P, ) is the unit of dynamic viscosity in the centimetre gram second system of units . 1 It is named after Jean Léonard Marie Poiseuille .        1   P   =     0.100   kg   ⋅   m   -  1    ⋅   s   -  1     =     1   g   ⋅   cm   -  1    ⋅   s   -  1             1  P    normal-⋅    0.100  kg    superscript  m    1     superscript  s    1           normal-⋅    1  g    superscript  cm    1     superscript  s    1        1\ \mbox{P}=0.100\ \mbox{kg}\cdot\mbox{m}^{-1}\cdot\mbox{s}^{-1}=1\ \mbox{g}%
 \cdot\mbox{cm}^{-1}\cdot\mbox{s}^{-1}     The analogous unit in the International System of Units is the pascal second (Pa·s):         1   Pa   ⋅  s   =     1   kg   ⋅   m   -  1    ⋅   s   -  1     =    10   P          normal-⋅    1  Pa   s    normal-⋅    1  kg    superscript  m    1     superscript  s    1            10  P      1\ \mbox{Pa}\cdot\mbox{s}=1\ \mbox{kg}\cdot\mbox{m}^{-1}\cdot\mbox{s}^{-1}=10%
 \ \mbox{P}     The poise is often used with the metric prefix  centi- . A centipoise is one one-hundredth of a poise, and one millipascal-second (mPa·s) in SI units. (1 cP = 10 −2 P = 10 −3 Pa·s = 1 mPa·s)  Centipoise is properly abbreviated cP, but the alternative abbreviations cps, cp, and cPs are also commonly seen.  Water has a viscosity of 0.00899 Poise at 25 °C and a pressure of 1 atmosphere . (0.00899 P = 0.899cP = 0.899 mPa·s) 2  Use in laboratory  A viscometer can be used to measure viscosity and might read in centipoise.  When determining centipoise, all other fluids are calibrated to the viscosity of distilled water at STP . (in some practices, one can use the following approximation: water at approximately 70 °F (21 °C) is about one centipoise).  Thicker liquids, like honey, have higher viscosities. For example, while ethylene glycol has a viscosity of just 24 centipoise at 23 C, honey has a viscosity of 2 000 centipoise and molasses has a viscosity of 5 000 centipoise. Lard has a viscosity of 100 000 centipoise.
