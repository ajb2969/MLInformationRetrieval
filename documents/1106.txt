   Supnick matrix      Supnick matrix   A Supnick matrix or Supnick array – named after Fred Supnick of the City College of New York , who introduced the notion in 1957 – is a Monge array which is also a symmetric matrix .  Mathematical definition  A Supnick matrix is a square Monge array that is symmetric around the main diagonal .  An n -by- n  matrix is a Supnick matrix if, for all i , j , k , l such that if      1  ≤  i  <  k  ≤  n        1  i       k       n     1\leq i   and    1  ≤  j  <  l  ≤  n        1  j       l       n     1\leq j   then        a   i  j    +   a   k  l     ≤    a   i  l    +    a   k  j             subscript  a    i  j     subscript  a    k  l        subscript  a    i  l     subscript  a    k  j       a_{ij}+a_{kl}\leq a_{il}+a_{kj}\,     and also        a   i  j    =   a   j  i     .       subscript  a    i  j     subscript  a    j  i      a_{ij}=a_{ji}.\,     A logically equivalent definition is given by Rudolf & Woeginger who in 1995 proved that   ''A matrix is a Supnick matrix iff it can be written as the sum of a sum matrix S and a non-negative linear combination of LL-UR block matrices.''   The sum matrix is defined in terms of a sequence of n real numbers {α i }:       S  =   [   s   i  j    ]   =   [    α  i   +   α  j    ]    ;        S   delimited-[]   subscript  s    i  j           delimited-[]     subscript  α  i    subscript  α  j        S=[s_{ij}]=[\alpha_{i}+\alpha_{j}];\,     and an LL-UR block matrix consists of two symmetrically placed rectangles in the lower-left and upper right corners for which a ij = 1, with all the rest of the matrix elements equal to zero.  Properties  Adding two Supnick matrices together will result in a new Supnick matrix (Deineko and Woeginger 2006).  Multiplying a Supnick matrix by a non-negative real number produces a new Supnick matrix (Deineko and Woeginger 2006).  If the distance matrix in a traveling salesman problem can be written as a Supnick matrix, that particular instance of the problem admits an easy solution (even though the problem is, in general, NP hard ).
