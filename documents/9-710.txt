   Spherical design      Spherical design   A spherical design , part of combinatorial design theory in mathematics , is a finite set of N points on the d -dimensional unit n-sphere  S d such that the average value of any polynomial f of degree t or less on the set equals the average value of f on the whole sphere (that is, the integral of f over S d divided by the area or measure of S d ). Such a set is often called a spherical  t - design to indicate the value of t , which is a fundamental parameter.  Spherical designs can be of value in approximation theory , in statistics for experimental design (being usable to construct rotatable designs ), in combinatorics , and in geometry . The main problem is to find examples, given d and t , that are not too large. However, such examples may be hard to come by. Spherical t-designs have also recently been appropriated in quantum mechanics in the form of quantum t-designs with various applications to quantum information theory , quantum computing and POVMs .  The concept of a spherical design is due to Delsarte, Goethals, and Seidel (1977). The existence and structure of spherical designs with d = 1 (that is, in a circle) was studied in depth by Hong (1982).  arbitrary-dimensional spherical design  Shortly thereafter, Seymour and Zaslavsky (1984) proved that such designs exist of all sufficiently large sizes; that is, there is a number N ( d , t ) such that for every N ≥ N ( d , t ) there exists a spherical t -design of N points in dimension d . However, their proof gave no idea of how big N ( d , t ) is. Good estimates for that were found later on. Besides these "large" sizes, there are many sporadic small spherical designs; many of them are related to finite group actions on the sphere and are of great interest in themselves.  Recently, Bondarenko, Radchenko, and Viazovska obtained the optimal asymptotic upper bound $N(d,t) for all positive integers ''d'' and ''t''.

 One application of spherical designs is for whole-sphere data collection.
 Spherical t-designs meet the "accurately approximate integrals by sums" criteria for "good" pixelizations of the sphere. [http://www.iop.org/EJ/article/1538-4357/470/2/L81/5407.text.html "An Icosahedron-based Method for Pixelizing the Celestial Sphere"]
