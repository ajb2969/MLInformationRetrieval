Formylaspartate deformylase

In enzymology, a formylaspartate deformylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-formyl-L-aspartate + H2O 
 
 
 
  formate + L-aspartate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are N-formyl-L-aspartate and H2O, whereas its two products are formate and L-aspartate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-formyl-L-aspartate amidohydrolase. This enzyme is also called formylaspartic formylase (formylase I, formylase II). This enzyme participates in histidine metabolism and glyoxylate and dicarboxylate metabolism.
