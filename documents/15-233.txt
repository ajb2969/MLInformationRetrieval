Conceptual Spaces

The Theory of Conceptual Spaces is a theory about concept representation proposed by Peter GÃ¤rdenfors.1 It is motivated by the notions like conceptual similarity and prototype theory. A conceptual space is multi-dimensional feature space where points denote objects, and regions denote concepts. Its bases are composed by quality dimensions, which denote basic features in which concepts and objects can be compared, as such as weight, colour, taste and so on.
The theory also puts forward the notion that natural categories are convex regions in a conceptual spaces. In that if 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are elements of a category, and if 
 
 
 
  is between 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  is also likely to belong to the category. The notion of concept convexity allow the interpretation of the focal points of regions as category prototypes. In the more general formulations of the theory, concepts are defined in terms conceptual similarity to their prototypes.
