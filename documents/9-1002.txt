Hybrid functional

Hybrid functionals are a class of approximations to the exchange–correlation energy functional in density functional theory (DFT) that incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree–Fock theory with exchange and correlation from other sources (ab initio or empirical). The exact exchange energy functional is expressed in terms of the Kohn–Sham orbitals rather than the density, so is termed an implicit density functional. One of the most commonly used versions is B3LYP, which stands for Becke, 3-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr.
Origin
The hybrid approach to constructing density functional approximations was introduced by Axel Becke in 1993.1 Hybridization with Hartree–Fock (exact) exchange provides a simple scheme for improving many molecular properties, such as atomization energies, bond lengths and vibration frequencies, which tend to be poorly described with simple "ab initio" functionals.2
Method
A hybrid exchange-correlation functional is usually constructed as a linear combination of the Hartree–Fock exact exchange functional,

and any number of exchange and correlation explicit density functionals. The parameters determining the weight of each individual functional are typically specified by fitting the functional's predictions to experimental or accurately calculated thermochemical data, although in the case of the "adiabatic connection functionals" the weights can be set a priori.3
B3LYP
For example, the popular B3LYP (Becke, three-parameter, Lee-Yang-Parr)45 exchange-correlation functional is:



where 
 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
 . 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are generalized gradient approximations: the Becke 88 exchange functional6 and the correlation functional of Lee, Yang and Parr7 for B3LYP, and 
 
 
 
 
  is the VWN local-density approximation to the correlation functional.8
The three parameters defining B3LYP have been taken without modification from Becke's original fitting of the analogous B3PW91 functional to a set of atomization energies, ionization potentials, proton affinities, and total atomic energies.9
PBE0
The PBE0 functional10 11 mixes the PBE exchange energy and Hartree-Fock exchange energy in a set 3 to 1 ratio, along with the full PBE correlation energy:



where 
 
 
 
  is the Hartree–Fock exact exchange functional, 
 
 
 
  is the PBE exchange functional, and 
 
 
 
  is the PBE correlation functional.12
HSE
The HSE (Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof)13 exchange-correlation functional uses an error function screened Coulomb potential to calculate the exchange portion of the energy in order to improve computational efficiency, especially for metallic systems.



where 
 
 
 
  is the mixing parameter and 
 
 
 
  is an adjustable parameter controlling the short-rangeness of the interaction. Standard values of 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  (usually referred to as HSE06) have been shown to give good results for most of systems. The HSE exchange-correlation functional degenerates to the PBE0 hybrid functional for

Meta hybrid GGA
The M06 suite of functionals,1516 are a set of four meta-hybrid GGA and meta-GGA DFT functionals. They are constructed with empirical fitting of their parameters, but constraining to the uniform electron gas.
The family includes the functionals M06-L, M06, M06-2X and M06-HF, with a different amount of exact exchange on each one. M06-L is fully local without HF exchange (thus it cannot be considered hybrid), M06 has 27% of HF exchange, M06-2X 54% and M06-HF 100%.
The advantages and utilities of each one are:

M06-L: Fast, Good for transition metals, inorganic and organometallics.
M06: For main group, organometallics, kinetics and non-covalent bonds.
M06-2X: Main group, kinetics.
M06-HF: Charge transfer TD-DFT, systems where self interaction is pathological.

The suite has a very good response under dispersion forces, improving one of the biggest deficiencies in DFT methods. The s6 scaling factor on Grimme's long range dispersion correction is 0.20, 0.25 and 0.06 for M06-L, M06 and M06-2X respectively.
