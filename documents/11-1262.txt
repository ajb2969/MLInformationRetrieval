   Galactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-galactosyltransferase      Galactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-galactosyltransferase   In enzymology , a galactosylxylosylprotein 3-beta-galactosyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   UDP-galactose + 4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   UDP + 3-beta-D-galactosyl-4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are UDP-galactose and 4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein , whereas its two products are UDP and 3-beta-D-galactosyl-4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein .  This enzyme belongs to the family of glycosyltransferases , specifically the hexosyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is UDP-galactose:4-beta-D-galactosyl-O-beta-D-xylosylprotein 3-beta-D-galactosyltransferase . Other names in common use include galactosyltransferase II , and uridine diphosphogalactose-galactosylxylose galactosyltransferase . This enzyme participates in chondroitin sulfate biosynthesis and glycan structures - biosynthesis 1 . It employs one cofactor , manganese .
