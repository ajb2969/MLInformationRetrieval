Wall–Sun–Sun prime

In number theory, a Wall–Sun–Sun prime or Fibonacci–Wieferich prime is a certain kind of prime number which is conjectured to exist, although none are known.
Definition
A prime p > 5 is called a Wall–Sun–Sun prime if p2 divides the Fibonacci number $F_{p - \left(\frac{{p}}{{5}}\right)}$, where the Legendre symbol $\textstyle\left(\frac{{p}}{{5}}\right)$ is defined as
$$\left(\frac{p}{5}\right) = \begin{cases} 1 &\text{if }p \equiv \pm1 \pmod 5\\ -1 &\text{if }p \equiv \pm2 \pmod 5 \end{cases}$$
Equivalently, a prime p is a Wall–Sun–Sun prime iff Lp ≡ 1 (mod p2), where Lp is the p-th Lucas number.1
A k-Wall-Sun-Sun prime is defined as a prime p such that p2 divides the k-Fibonacci number (a Lucas sequence Un with (P, Q) = (k, -1)) $F_k({p - \left(\frac{{k^2+4}}{{p}}\right)})$, where $\left(\frac{{k^2+4}}{{p}}\right)$ is the Legendre symbol. For example, 241 is a k-Wall-Sun-Sun prime for k = 3. Thus, a prime p is a k-Wall-Sun-Sun prime iff Vk(p) ≡ 1 (mod p2), where Vn is a Lucas sequence with (P, Q) = (k, -1).
Least n-Wall-Sun-Sun prime are

13, 241, 2, 3, 191, 5, 2, 3, 2683, ... (start with n = 2)
 

Existence
It has been conjectured that there are infinitely many Wall–Sun–Sun primes.2 No Wall–Sun–Sun primes are known .
In 2007, Richard J. McIntosh and Eric L. Roettger showed that if any exist, they must be > 2$\times 10^14$.3 Dorais and Klyve extended this range to 9.7$\times 10^14$ without finding such a prime.4 In December 2011, another search was started by the PrimeGrid project.5 As of October 2014, PrimeGrid has extended the search limit to 2.8$\times 10^16$ and continues.6
History
Wall–Sun–Sun primes are named after Donald Dines Wall,7 Zhi Hong Sun and Zhi Wei Sun; Z. H. Sun and Z. W. Sun showed in 1992 that if the first case of Fermat's last theorem was false for a certain prime p, then p would have to be a Wall–Sun–Sun prime.8 As a result, prior to Andrew Wiles' proof of Fermat's last theorem, the search for Wall–Sun–Sun primes was also the search for a potential counterexample to this centuries-old conjecture.
Generalizations
A Tribonacci-Wieferich prime is a prime p satisfying  h(p2)}}, where h is the least positive integer satisfying [Th,Th+1,Th+2] ≡ [T0, T1, T2] (mod m) and Tn denotes the n-th Tribonacci number. No Tribonacci-Wieferich prime exists below 1011.9
A Pell-Wieferich prime is a prime p satisfying p2 divides Pp-1, when p congruent to 1 or 7 (mod 8), or p2 divides Pp+1, when p congruent to 3 or 5 (mod 8), where Pn denotes the n-th Pell number. For example, 13, 31, and 1546463 are Pell-Wieferich primes, and no others below 109.
