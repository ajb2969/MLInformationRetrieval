   Glutathione—CoA-glutathione transhydrogenase      Glutathione—CoA-glutathione transhydrogenase   In enzymology , a glutathione—CoA-glutathione transhydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   CoA + glutathione disulfide   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA-glutathione + glutathione   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CoA and glutathione disulfide , whereas its two products are CoA-glutathione and glutathione .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on a sulfur group of donors with a disulfide as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CoA:glutathione-disulfide oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include glutathione-coenzyme A glutathione disulfide transhydrogenase , glutathione-coenzyme A glutathione disulfide transhydrogenase , glutathione coenzyme A-glutathione transhydrogenase , glutathione:coenzyme A-glutathione transhydrogenase , coenzyme A:oxidized-glutathione oxidoreductase , and coenzyme A:glutathione-disulfide oxidoreductase . This enzyme participates in cysteine metabolism and glutathione metabolism .  References     "  Category:EC 1.8.4  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
