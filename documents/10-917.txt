   Cucurbitacin Delta23-reductase      Cucurbitacin Delta23-reductase   In enzymology , a cucurbitacin Delta23-reductase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin + NAD(P)+   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   cucurbitacin + NAD(P)H + H +    The 3 substrates of this enzyme are 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin , NAD + , and NADP + , whereas its 4 products are cucurbitacin , NADH , NADPH , and H + .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on the CH-CH group of donor with NAD+ or NADP+ as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 23,24-dihydrocucurbitacin:NAD(P)+ Delta23-oxidoreductase . This enzyme is also called NAD(P)H: cucurbitacin B Delta23-oxidoreductase . It employs one cofactor , manganese .
