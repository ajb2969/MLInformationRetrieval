   Serpentine curve      Serpentine curve   A serpentine curve is a curve whose equation is of the form           x  2   y   +    a  2   y    -   a  b  x    =  0   ,    a  b   >  0.      formulae-sequence           superscript  x  2   y      superscript  a  2   y      a  b  x    0       a  b   0.     x^{2}y+a^{2}y-abx=0,\quad ab>0.     Equivalently, it has a parametric representation      x  =   a   cot   (  t  )         x    a    t      x=a\cot(t)   ,     y  =   b   sin   (  t  )     cos   (  t  )      ,      y    b    t     t      y=b\sin(t)\cos(t),     or functional representation       y  =    a  b  x     x  2   +   a  2      .      y      a  b  x      superscript  x  2    superscript  a  2       y=\frac{abx}{x^{2}+a^{2}}.     History  Serpentine curves were studied by L'Hôpital and Huygens , and named and classified by Newton .  Visual appearance  (Figure)  The serpentine curve for a = b = 1.
