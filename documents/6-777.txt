   Bispectrum      Bispectrum   In mathematics , in the area of statistical analysis , the bispectrum is a statistic used to search for nonlinear interactions.  Definitions  The Fourier transform of the second-order cumulant , i.e., the autocorrelation function, is the traditional power spectrum .  The Fourier transform of C 3 ( t 1 , t 2 ) (third-order cumulant -generating function) is called the bispectrum or bispectral density .  Calculation  Applying the convolution theorem allows fast calculation of the bispectrum      B   (   f  1   ,   f  2   )    =    F  *    (    f  1   +   f  2    )     .   F   (   f  1   )    .   F   (   f  2   )       formulae-sequence      B    subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2        superscript  F       subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2        F   subscript  f  1      F   subscript  f  2      B(f_{1},f_{2})=F^{*}(f_{1}+f_{2}).F(f_{1}).F(f_{2})   , where   F   F   F   denotes the Fourier transform of the signal, and    F  *     superscript  F     F^{*}   its conjugate.  Generalizations  Bispectra fall in the category of higher-order spectra , or polyspectra and provide supplementary information to the power spectrum. The third order polyspectrum (bispectrum) is the easiest to compute, and hence the most popular.  A statistic defined analogously is the bispectral coherency or bicoherence .  Applications  Bispectrum and bicoherence may be applied to the case of non-linear interactions of a continuous spectrum of propagating waves in one dimension. 1  Bispectral measurements have been carried out for EEG  signals monitoring. 2 It was also shown that bispectra characterize differences between families of musical instruments. 3  In seismology , signals rarely have adequate duration for making sensible bispectral estimates from time averages.
