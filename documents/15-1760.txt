Template:Bra-ket/doc

This is for a producing inner products of quantum states in bra–ket notation, using wikicode, ideally with , as an alternative to LaTeX in  mode.
This template uses .
Application
There are two parameters, which is the text to be displayed as the bra and ket labels.
Examples
The inner product of the kets $| ξ \rangle$ and $| ψ \rangle$ can be written: $\langle ψ ξ \rangle$ = $\langle ξ ψ \rangle$†, that is $\langle ψ ξ \rangle$ = $\langle ξ ψ \rangle$†.
Using , the inner product can be written: $\langle ψ ξ \rangle$, that is $\langle ψ ξ \rangle$.
