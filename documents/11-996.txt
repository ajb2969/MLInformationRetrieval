Trihydroxystilbene synthase

In enzymology, a trihydroxystilbene synthase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

3 malonyl-CoA + 4-coumaroyl-CoA 
 
 
 
  4 CoA + 3,4',5-trihydroxy-stilbene + 4 CO2


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and 4-coumaroyl-CoA, whereas its 3 products are CoA, 3,4',5-trihydroxy-stilbene (resveratrol), and CO2.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, To be specific those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:4-coumaroyl-CoA malonyltransferase (cyclizing). Other names in common use include resveratrol synthase, and stilbene synthase. This enzyme participates in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis.
Structural studies
As of late 2007, two structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes  and .
