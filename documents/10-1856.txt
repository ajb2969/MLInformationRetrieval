Psychosine sulfotransferase

In enzymology, a psychosine sulfotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction:

3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate + galactosylsphingosine 
 
 
 
  adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate + psychosine sulfate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 3'-phosphoadenylyl sulfate and galactosylsphingosine, whereas its two products are adenosine 3',5'-bisphosphate and psychosine sulfate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically the sulfotransferases, which transfer sulfur-containing groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 3'-phosphoadenylyl-sulfate:galactosylsphingosine sulfotransferase. Other names in common use include PAPS:psychosine sulphotransferase, and 3'-phosphoadenosine 5'-phosphosulfate-psychosine sulphotransferase.
