   Deformation (meteorology)      Deformation (meteorology)   Deformation is the rate of change of shape of fluid bodies. Meteorologically, this quantity is very important in the formation of atmospheric fronts , in the explanation of cloud shapes, and in the diffusion of materials and properties. 1  Equations  The deformation of horizontal wind is defined as     def  ùêï   =     A  2   +   B  2          def  ùêï        superscript  A  2    superscript  B  2       \operatorname{def}\mathbf{V}=\sqrt{A^{2}+B^{2}}   , where     A   =     ‚àÇ  v    ‚àÇ  x    +    ‚àÇ  u    ‚àÇ  y         A        v     x        u     y       \ A=\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}   and     B   =     ‚àÇ  u    ‚àÇ  x    -    ‚àÇ  v    ‚àÇ  y         B        u     x        v     y       \ B=\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}-\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}   , representing the derivatives of wind component. Because these derivatives vary greatly with the rotation of the coordinate system, so do    A    A   \ A   and    B    B   \ B   . 2  Stretching direction  The deformation elements    A    A   \ A   and    B    B   \ B   (above) can be used to find the direction of the dilatation axis , the line along which the material elements stretch (also known as the stretching direction ). Several flow patterns are characteristic of large deformation: confluence, diffluence, and shear flow. , also known as stretching , is the elongating of a fluid body along the flow (streamline convergence). , also known as shearing , is the elongating of a fluid body normal to the flow (streamline divergence). 3  See also   Wind shear  Convergence zone  Divergence   References  "  Category:Vector calculus     Djuriƒá, D: "Weather Analysis".
