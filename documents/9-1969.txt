It is analogous to the square tiling of the plane and to the cubic honeycomb of 3-space.  Constructions  There are many different Wythoff constructions of this honeycomb. The most symmetric form is regular , with Schläfli symbol {4,3 4 ,4}. Another form has two alternating 6-cube facets (like a checkerboard) with Schläfli symbol {4,3 3 ,3 1,1 }. The lowest symmetry Wythoff construction has 64 types of facets around each vertex and a prismatic product Schläfli symbol {∞} 6 .  Related honeycombs  The [4,3 4 ,4], , Coxeter group generates 127 permutations of uniform tessellations, 71 with unique symmetry and 70 with unique geometry. The expanded 6-cubic honeycomb is geometrically identical to the 6-cubic honeycomb.  The 6-cubic honeycomb can be alternated into the 6-demicubic honeycomb , replacing the 6-cubes with 6-demicubes , and the alternated gaps are filled by 6-orthoplex facets.  Trirectified 6-cubic honeycomb  A trirectified 6-cubic honeycomb , , containins all birectified 6-orthoplex facets and is the Voronoi tessellation of the D 6 * lattice . Facets can be identically colored from a doubled     C  ~   6     subscript   normal-~  C   6    {\tilde{C}}_{6}   ×2, [[4,3 4 ,4]] symmetry, alternately colored from     C  ~   6     subscript   normal-~  C   6    {\tilde{C}}_{6}   , [4,3 4 ,4] symmetry, three colors from     B  ~   6     subscript   normal-~  B   6    {\tilde{B}}_{6}   , [4,3 3 ,3 1,1 ] symmetry, and 4 colors from     D  ~   6     subscript   normal-~  D   6    {\tilde{D}}_{6}   , [3 1,1 ,3,3,3 1,1 ] symmetry.
