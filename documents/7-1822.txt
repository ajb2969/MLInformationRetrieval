   Spectral asymmetry      Spectral asymmetry   In mathematics and physics , the spectral asymmetry is the asymmetry in the distribution of the spectrum of eigenvalues of an operator . In mathematics, the spectral asymmetry arises in the study of elliptic operators on compact manifolds , and is given a deep meaning by the Atiyah-Singer index theorem . In physics, it has numerous applications, typically resulting in a fractional charge due to the asymmetry of the spectrum of a Dirac operator . For example, the vacuum expectation value of the baryon number is given by the spectral asymmetry of the Hamiltonian operator . The spectral asymmetry of the confined quark fields is an important property of the chiral bag model .  Definition  Given an operator with eigenvalues     ω  n     subscript  ω  n    \omega_{n}   , an equal number of which are positive and negative, the spectral asymmetry may be defined as the sum      B  =     lim   t  →  0      1  2     ∑  n     sgn   (   ω  n   )    exp      -   t   |   ω  n   |         B      subscript    normal-→  t  0        1  2     subscript   n      sgn   subscript  ω  n           t     subscript  ω  n        B=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n}\operatorname{sgn}(\omega_{n})\exp-t|\omega_%
 {n}|     where    sgn   (  x  )      sgn  x    \operatorname{sgn}(x)   is the sign function . Other regulators , such as the zeta function regulator , may be used.  The need for both a positive and negative spectrum in the definition is why the spectral asymmetry usually occurs in the study of Dirac operators .  Example  As an example, consider an operator with a spectrum       ω  n   =   n  +  θ        subscript  ω  n     n  θ     \omega_{n}=n+\theta     where n is an integer, ranging over all positive and negative values. One may show in a straightforward manner that the spectral asymmetry in this case is    B  =  θ      B  θ    B=\theta   .  Discussion  Related to the spectral asymmetry is the vacuum expectation value of the energy associated with the operator, the Casimir energy , which is given by      E  =     lim   t  →  0      1  2     ∑  n     |   ω  n   |   exp      -   t   |   ω  n   |         E      subscript    normal-→  t  0        1  2     subscript   n        subscript  ω  n           t     subscript  ω  n        E=\lim_{t\to 0}\frac{1}{2}\sum_{n}|\omega_{n}|\exp-t|\omega_{n}|     This sum is formally divergent, and the divergences must be accounted for and removed using standard regularization techniques.
