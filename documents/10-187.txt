   Bubble point      Bubble point   When heating a liquid consisting of two or more components, the bubble point is the temperature (at a given pressure ) where the first bubble of vapor is formed. Given that vapor will probably have a different composition than the liquid, the bubble point (along with the dew point ) at different compositions are useful data when designing distillation systems.  For a single component the bubble point and the dew point are the same and are referred to as the boiling point .  Calculating the bubble point  At the bubble point, the following relationship holds:       ∑   i  =  1    N  c     y  i    =    ∑   i  =  1    N  c      K  i    x  i     =  1          superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  N  c     subscript  y  i      superscript   subscript     i  1     subscript  N  c       subscript  K  i    subscript  x  i          1     \sum_{i=1}^{N_{c}}y_{i}=\sum_{i=1}^{N_{c}}K_{i}x_{i}=1    where      K  i   ≡    y   i  e     x   i  e          subscript  K  i      subscript  y    i  e     subscript  x    i  e       K_{i}\equiv\frac{y_{ie}}{x_{ie}}   . K is the distribution coefficient or K factor , defined as the ratio of mole fraction in the vapor phase    (   y   i  e    )     subscript  y    i  e     \big(y_{ie}\big)   to the mole fraction in the liquid phase    (   x   i  e    )     subscript  x    i  e     \big(x_{ie}\big)   at equilibrium. When Raoult's law and Dalton's law hold for the mixture, the K factor is defined as the ratio of the vapor pressure to the total pressure of the system: 1      K  i   =    P  i  ′   P        subscript  K  i      subscript   superscript  P  normal-′   i   P     K_{i}=\frac{P^{\prime}_{i}}{P}     References    See also   Phase diagram  Azeotrope  Dew point   "  Category:Temperature  Category:Phase transitions  Category:Gases     ↩
