Pyrrolysine—tRNAPyl ligase

Pyrrolysine—tRNAPyl ligase (, PylS, pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase) is an enzyme with system name L-pyrrolysine:tRNAPyl ligase (AMP-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

ATP + L-pyrrolysine + tRNAPyl 
 
 
 
  AMP + diphosphate + L-pyrrolysyl-tRNAPyl
 

This enzyme is specific for pyrrolysine as substrate as it cannot be replaced by lysine or any of the other natural amino acids.
