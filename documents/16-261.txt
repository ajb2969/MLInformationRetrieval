   Pyrrolysine—tRNAPyl ligase      Pyrrolysine—tRNAPyl ligase   Pyrrolysine—tRNAPyl ligase (, PylS , pyrrolysyl-tRNA synthetase ) is an enzyme with system name L-pyrrolysine:tRNAPyl ligase (AMP-forming) . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   ATP + L- pyrrolysine + tRNAPyl   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AMP + diphosphate + L-pyrrolysyl-tRNAPyl   This enzyme is specific for pyrrolysine as substrate as it cannot be replaced by lysine or any of the other natural amino acids.
