   Linear system      Linear system   A linear system is a mathematical model of a system based on the use of a linear operator . Linear systems typically exhibit features and properties that are much simpler than the general, nonlinear case. As a mathematical abstraction or idealization, linear systems find important applications in automatic control theory, signal processing , and telecommunications . For example, the propagation medium for wireless communication systems can often be modeled by linear systems.  Definition  A general deterministic system can be described by operator,   H   H   H   , that maps an input,    x   (  t  )       x  t    x(t)   , as a function of   t   t   t   to an output,    y   (  t  )       y  t    y(t)   , a type of black box description. Linear systems satisfy the property of superposition . Given two valid inputs       x  1    (  t  )        subscript  x  1   t    x_{1}(t)\,          x  2    (  t  )        subscript  x  2   t    x_{2}(t)\,   as well as their respective outputs        y  1    (  t  )    =   H   {    x  1    (  t  )    }           subscript  y  1   t     H      subscript  x  1   t       y_{1}(t)=H\left\{x_{1}(t)\right\}           y  2    (  t  )    =   H   {    x  2    (  t  )    }           subscript  y  2   t     H      subscript  x  2   t       y_{2}(t)=H\left\{x_{2}(t)\right\}   then a linear system must satisfy        α   y  1    (  t  )    +   β   y  2    (  t  )     =   H   {    α   x  1    (  t  )    +   β   x  2    (  t  )     }            α   subscript  y  1   t     β   subscript  y  2   t      H       α   subscript  x  1   t     β   subscript  x  2   t        \alpha y_{1}(t)+\beta y_{2}(t)=H\left\{\alpha x_{1}(t)+\beta x_{2}(t)\right\}   for any scalar values    α    α   \alpha\,   and    β    β   \beta\,   .  The system is then defined by the equation H(x(t)) = y(t), where y(t) is some arbitrary function of time, and x(t) is the system state. Given y(t) and H, x(t) can be solved for. For example, a simple harmonic oscillator obeys the differential equation:       m     d  2    (  x  )     d   t  2      =   -   k  x          m       superscript  d  2   x     d   superscript  t  2          k  x      m\frac{d^{2}(x)}{dt^{2}}=-kx   If     H   (   x   (  t  )    )    =    m     d  2    (   x   (  t  )    )     d   t  2      +   k  x   (  t  )           H    x  t        m       superscript  d  2     x  t      d   superscript  t  2        k  x  t      H(x(t))=m\frac{d^{2}(x(t))}{dt^{2}}+kx(t)   , then H is a linear operator. Letting y(t) = 0, we can rewrite the differential equation as H(x(t)) = y(t), which shows that a simple harmonic oscillator is a linear system.  The behavior of the resulting system subjected to a complex input can be described as a sum of responses to simpler inputs. In nonlinear systems, there is no such relation. This mathematical property makes the solution of modelling equations simpler than many nonlinear systems. For time-invariant systems this is the basis of the impulse response or the frequency response methods (see LTI system theory ), which describe a general input function x(t) in terms of unit impulses or frequency components .  Typical differential equations of linear time-invariant systems are well adapted to analysis using the Laplace transform in the continuous case, and the Z-transform in the discrete case (especially in computer implementations).  Another perspective is that solutions to linear systems comprise a system of functions which act like vectors in the geometric sense.  A common use of linear models is to describe a nonlinear system by linearization . This is usually done for mathematical convenience.  Time-varying impulse response  The time-varying impulse response  h ( t 2 , t 1 ) of a linear system is defined as the response of the system at time t = t 2 to a single impulse applied at time t = t 1 . In other words, if the input x ( t ) to a linear system is       x   (  t  )    =   δ   (   t  -   t  1    )          x  t     δ    t   subscript  t  1       x(t)=\delta(t-t_{1})\,     where δ( t ) represents the Dirac delta function , and the corresponding response y ( t ) of the system is         y   (  t  )    |    t  =   t  2     =   h   (   t  2   ,   t  1   )         evaluated-at    y  t     t   subscript  t  2       h    subscript  t  2    subscript  t  1       y(t)|_{t=t_{2}}=h(t_{2},t_{1})\,     then the function h ( t 2 , t 1 ) is the time-varying impulse response of the system.  Time-varying convolution integral  Continuous time  The output of any continuous time linear system is related to the input by the time-varying convolution integral:       y   (  t  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    h   (  t  ,  s  )   x   (  s  )   d  s          y  t     superscript   subscript            h   t  s   x  s  d  s      y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(t,s)x(s)ds     or, equivalently,       y   (  t  )    =    ∫   -  ∞   ∞    h   (  t  ,   t  -  τ   )   x   (   t  -  τ   )   d  τ          y  t     superscript   subscript            h   t    t  τ    x    t  τ   d  τ      y(t)=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}h(t,t-\tau)x(t-\tau)d\tau     where      s  =   t  -  τ       s    t  τ     s=t-\tau     Discrete time  The output of any discrete time linear system is related to the input by the time-varying convolution sum:       y   [  n  ]    =    ∑   k  =   -  ∞    ∞    h   [  n  ,  k  ]   x   [  k  ]           y   delimited-[]  n      superscript   subscript     k            h   n  k   x   delimited-[]  k       y[n]=\sum_{k=-\infty}^{\infty}{h[n,k]x[k]}     or equivalently,       y   [  n  ]    =    ∑   m  =   -  ∞    ∞    h   [  n  ,   n  -  m   ]   x   [   n  -  m   ]           y   delimited-[]  n      superscript   subscript     m            h   n    n  m    x   delimited-[]    n  m        y[n]=\sum_{m=-\infty}^{\infty}{h[n,n-m]x[n-m]}     where      k  =   n  -   m        k    n  m     k=n-m\,     represents the lag time between the stimulus at time m and the response at time n .  Causality  A linear system is causal if and only if the system's time varying impulse response is identically zero whenever the time t of the response is earlier than the time s of the stimulus. In other words, for a causal system, the following condition must hold:       h   (  t  ,  s  )    =   0  for  t   <   s           h   t  s      0  for  t        s     h(t,s)=0\text{ for }t     See also   Linear system of divisors in algebraic geometry  Shift invariant system  LTI system theory  Nonlinear system  System analysis  System of linear equations   "  Category:Systems theory
