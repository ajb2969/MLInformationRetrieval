   D-alanine gamma-glutamyltransferase      D-alanine gamma-glutamyltransferase   In enzymology , a D-alanine gamma-glutamyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-glutamine + D-alanine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   NH 3 + gamma-L-glutamyl-D-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-glutamine and D-alanine , whereas its two products are NH 3 and gamma-L-glutamyl-D-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the aminoacyltransferases . The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-glutamine:D-alanine gamma-glutamyltransferase .
