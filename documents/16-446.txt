Grace–Walsh–Szegő theorem

In mathematics, the Grace–Walsh–Szegő coincidence theorem12 is a result named after John Hilton Grace, Joseph L. Walsh, Gábor Szegő.
Statement
Suppose ƒ(z1, ..., zn) is a polynomial with complex coefficients, and that it is

symmetric, i.e. invariant under permutations of the variables, and
multi-affine, i.e. affine in each variable separately.

Let A be any simply connected open set in the complex plane. If either A is convex or the degree of ƒ is n, then for any 
 
 
 
  there exists 
 
 
 
  such that
