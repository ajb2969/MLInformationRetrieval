Bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphatase




Bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphatase

In enzymology, a bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphatase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

P1,P3-bis(5'-adenosyl) triphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  ADP + AMP
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are P1,P3-bis(5'-adenosyl) triphosphate and H2O, whereas its two products are ADP and AMP.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, specifically those acting on acid anhydrides in phosphorus-containing anhydrides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is P1,P3-bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphate adenylohydrolase. Other names in common use include dinucleosidetriphosphatase, diadenosine 5,5-P1,P3-triphosphatase, and 1-P,3-P-bis(5'-adenosyl)-triphosphate adenylohydrolase. This enzyme participates metabolic pathways involved in purine metabolism, and may have a role in the development of small cell lung cancer, and non-small cell lung cancer.
