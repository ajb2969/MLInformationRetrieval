   Papkovich–Neuber solution      Papkovich–Neuber solution   The Papkovich–Neuber solution is a technique for generating analytic solutions to the Newtonian incompressible Stokes equations , though it was originally developed to solve the equations of linear elasticity .  It can be shown that any Stokes flow with body force    𝐟  =  0      𝐟  0    \mathbf{f}=0   can be written in the form:      𝐮  =    1   2  μ     [    ∇   (    𝐱  ⋅  𝚽   +  χ   )    -   2  𝚽    ]        𝐮      1    2  μ     delimited-[]     normal-∇     normal-⋅  𝐱  𝚽   χ      2  𝚽        \mathbf{u}={1\over{2\mu}}\left[\nabla(\mathbf{x}\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}+\chi)-2%
 \mathbf{\Phi}\right]         p  =   ∇  ⋅  𝚽       p   normal-⋅  normal-∇  𝚽     p=\nabla\cdot\mathbf{\Phi}     where   𝚽   𝚽   \mathbf{\Phi}   is a harmonic vector potential and   χ   χ   \chi   is a harmonic scalar potential. The properties and ease of construction of harmonic functions makes the Papkovich–Neuber solution a powerful technique for solving the Stokes Equations in a variety of domains.  References    .   .
