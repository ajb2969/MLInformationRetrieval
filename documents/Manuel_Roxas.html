<hr/>

<p><strong>Manuel Acuña Roxas</strong> (January 1, 1892 – April 15, 1948) was the fifth <a href="President_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">President of the Philippines</a> who served from 1946 until his death in 1948. He briefly served as the third and last President of the <a href="Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Commonwealth of the Philippines</a> from May 28, 1946 to July 4, 1946, subsequently becoming the first President of the independent <a href="History_of_the_Philippines_(1946–65)" title="wikilink">Third Philippine Republic</a> after the United States ceded its sovereignty over the Philippines.</p>
<h2 id="early-life-and-career">Early life and career</h2>

<p>Róxas, child of <a href="Gerardo_Roxas_I" title="wikilink">Gerardo Róxas y Arroyo</a> and <a href="Rosario_Acuña" title="wikilink">Rosario Acuña</a> was born on <a href="New_Year's_Day" title="wikilink">New Year's Day</a> 1892 in <a class="uri" href="Capiz" title="wikilink">Capiz</a> (present-day Roxas City). He was a posthumous child, as his father Gerardo had died after having been mortally wounded by Spanish <a href="Guardia_Civil" title="wikilink">guardias civiles</a> the year before. He and his older brother, Mamerto, are raised by their mother and her father, Don Eleuterio Acuña. His other siblings from his father include Leopoldo and Margarita while he also had half siblings which consist of Consuelo, Leopoldo, Ines and Evaristo Picazo after his mother remarried.</p>

<p>The young Manuel received his early education in the public schools of Capiz, and at age twelve he attended <a href="St._Joseph's_Academy_(Taiwan)" title="wikilink">St. Joseph's Academy</a> in <a class="uri" href="Taiwan" title="wikilink">Taiwan</a>, but due to <a class="uri" href="homesickness" title="wikilink">homesickness</a>, he went back to Capiz. He eventually transferred to <a href="Arellano_(Manila_North)_High_School" title="wikilink">Manila High School</a> (later named Araullo High School), graduating with honours in 1909.</p>

<p>Roxas began his law studies at a private law school established by <a href="George_A._Malcolm" title="wikilink">George A. Malcolm</a>, the first dean of the <a href="University_of_the_Philippines_College_of_Law" title="wikilink">University of the Philippines College of Law</a>. On his second year, he enrolled at <a href="University_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">University of the Philippines</a>, where he was elected president of both his class and the student council. In 1913, Roxas obtained his law degree, graduated class <a class="uri" href="valedictorian" title="wikilink">valedictorian</a>, and subsequently topped the bar examinations with a grade of 92% on the same year.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="personal-life">Personal life</h2>

<p>Róxas was married to <a href="Trinidad_Roxas" title="wikilink">Trinidad de Leon</a> at Our Lady of Remedies Church located at Barangay Sibul, <a href="San_Miguel,_Bulacan" title="wikilink">San Miguel, Bulacan</a> in 1921. The couple had two children, Ma. Rosario ("Ruby"), who married Vicente Róxas (no relation) and <a href="Gerardo_Roxas" title="wikilink">Gerardo Manuel ("Gerry")</a>, who married Judy Araneta.</p>

<p>His son, Gerry, became a member of the <a href="Philippine_House_of_Representatives" title="wikilink">Philippine House of Representatives</a> and a leader of <a href="Liberal_Party_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Liberal Party of the Philippines</a>. Gerry's sons, <a href="Gerardo_Roxas,_Jr." title="wikilink">Gerardo, Jr. ("Dinggoy")</a> and <a href="Mar_Roxas" title="wikilink">Manuel II ("Mar")</a>, served as representatives from Capiz. In 2004, Mar became a <a href="Senate_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Senator</a> and was also elected president of the <a href="Liberal_Party_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a>. His daughter-in-law, Judy, continues to be a prominent and driving force of the Liberal Party.</p>

<p>Daughter Ruby has an only son, named Manolo.</p>
<h2 id="lineage">Lineage</h2>

<p>Róxas was a descendant of Antonio Róxas y Ureta, brother of Domingo Róxas y Ureta (a progenitor of the Róxas-<a href="Zobel_de_Ayala_family" title="wikilink">Zobel de Ayala</a> clan) who married María Saturnina Ubaldo.</p>

<p>Antonio Róxas y Ureta married Lucina Arroyo and would have a son named <a href="Gerardo_Roxas_I" title="wikilink">Gerardo Róxas y Arroyo</a> who in turn became the father of Manuel Róxas.</p>

<p>Prominent relatives from the line of Antonio Róxas:</p>
<ul>
<li>Felix Róxas y Arroyo (1820–?), son of Antonio Róxas, brother of Gerardo Arroyo Róxas and father of Felix Róxas, Jr. y Fernandez, the first Filipino qualified architect.</li>

<li>Margarita Róxas-de Ayala y Ubaldo (1826–1869), daughter of Domingo Ureta Róxas who married Antonio de Ayala, considered the first Filipino philanthropist and the greatest businessperson of her time.</li>
<li>Jose Bonifacio Róxas y Ubaldo (1834–1888), younger brother of Margarita Róxas-de Ayala and father of Pedro Pablo Róxas. In 1851, he would purchase the former Jesuit estate of Hacienda de San Pedro de Macati, which would become the future basis of the Zobel de Ayala Family wealth.</li>

</ul>

<p>Róxas is also believed to be related with Antonio J. Róxas who is the present chairman of the board of the Roxas &amp; Company, Inc. as well as chairman emeritus of Roxas Holdings, and director of Central Azucarero Don Pedro.</p>
<h2 id="political-career">Political career</h2>

<p>Roxas occupied more important positions in the Philippine government than any other Filipino had ever held before him. Starting in 1917 he was a member of the <a href="municipal_council" title="wikilink">municipal council</a> of Capiz. He became the youngest governor of his province and served in this capacity from 1919 to 1922.</p>

<p>He was elected to the Philippine House of Representatives in 1922, and for twelve consecutive years was <a href="Speaker_of_the_House_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">Speaker of the House</a>. He was member of the Constitutional Convention 1934 to 1935, Secretary of Finance, Chairman of the <a href="National_Economic_Council_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">National Economic Council</a>, Chairman of the <a href="National_Development_Company" title="wikilink">National Development Company</a> and many other government corporations and agencies, Brigadier General in the <a class="uri" href="USAFFE" title="wikilink">USAFFE</a>, Recognized Guerilla leader and Military leader of the Philippine Commonwealth Army.</p>
<h3 id="senate">Senate</h3>

<p> After the amendments to the 1935 Philippine Constitution were approved in 1941, he was elected (1941) to the Philippine Senate, but was unable to serve until 1945 because of the outbreak of World War II.</p>

<p>Having enrolled prior to World War II as an officer in the reserves, he was made liaison officer between the Commonwealth government and the United States Army Forces in the Far East headquarters of General <a href="Douglas_MacArthur" title="wikilink">Douglas MacArthur</a>. He accompanied President Quezon to <a href="Corregidor_Island" title="wikilink">Corregidor</a> where he supervised the destruction of Philippine currency to prevent its capture by the Japanese. When Quezon left Corregidor, Roxas went to Mindanao to direct the resistance there. It was prior to Quezon's departure that he was made Executive Secretary and designated as successor to the presidency in case Quezon or Vice-President <a href="Sergio_Osmeña" title="wikilink">Sergio Osmeña</a> were captured or killed. Roxas was captured in 1942 by the Japanese invasion forces. Roxas became chief advisor to <a href="Jose_P._Laurel" title="wikilink">Jose P. Laurel</a>, but secretly sympathetic to the guerrilla movement,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> he passed information via Ramona (Mona) Snyder to <a href="List_of_American_guerrillas_in_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Edwin Ramsey</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> He was returned by the military service of the <a href="Philippine_Commonwealth_Army" title="wikilink">Philippine Commonwealth Army</a> joining the troops and military officers of men was beginning the liberation against the Japanese forces.</p>

<p>When the Congress of the Philippines was convened in 1945, the legislators elected in 1941 chose Roxas as Senate President.</p>
<h2 id="presidential-election-of-1946">Presidential election of 1946</h2>

<p>Prior to the <a href="Philippine_general_election,_1946" title="wikilink">Philippine national elections of 1946</a>, at the height of the last <a href="Commonwealth_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Commonwealth</a> elections, Senate President Roxas and his friends left from the <a href="Nacionalista_Party" title="wikilink">Nacionalista Party</a> and formed the <a href="Liberal_Party_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">Liberal Party</a>. Roxas became their candidate for President and <a href="Elpidio_Quirino" title="wikilink">Elpidio Quirino</a> for Vice-President. The Nacionalistas, on the other hand, had Osmeña for President and Senator <a href="Eulogio_Rodriguez" title="wikilink">Eulogio Rodriguez</a> for Vice-President. Roxas had the staunch support of General MacArthur. Osmeña refused to campaign, saying that the Filipino people knew his reputation. On April 23, 1946, Roxas won 54 percent of the vote, and the Liberal Party won a majority in the legislature.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="last-president-of-the-commonwealth">Last President of the Commonwealth</h3>

<p> Roxas served as the President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines in a brief period, from May 28, 1946 to July 4, 1946 during which time Roxas helped prepared the groundwork for an independent Philippines.</p>

<p>On May 8, 1946, prior to his inauguration, President-elect Roxas, accompanied by <a href="High_Commissioner_to_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">US High Commissioner</a> <a href="Paul_V._McNutt" title="wikilink">Paul V. McNutt</a>, left for the United States.</p>

<p>On May 28, 1946, Roxas was inaugurated as the last President of the Commonwealth of the Philippines. The inaugural ceremonies were held in the ruins of the Legislative Building (now part of the <a href="National_Museum_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">National Museum of the Philippines</a>) and were witnessed by about 200,000 people. In his address, he outlined the main policies of his administration, mainly: closer ties with the United States; adherence to the newly created <a href="United_Nations" title="wikilink">United Nations</a>; national reconstruction; relief for the masses; social justice for the working class; the maintenance of peace and order; the preservation of individual rights and liberties of the citizenry; and honesty and efficiency of government.</p>

<p>On June 3, 1946, Roxas appeared for the first time before a <a href="joint_session" title="wikilink">joint session</a> of Congress to deliver his first <a href="State_of_the_Nation_Address_(Philippines)" title="wikilink">State of the Nation Address</a>. Among other things, he told the members of the Congress the grave problems and difficulties the Philippines face and reported on his special trip to the United States to discuss the approval for independence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>On June 21, he reappeared in front of another joint session of the Congress and urged the acceptance of two laws passed by the <a href="Congress_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Congress of the United States</a> on April 30, 1946—the <a href="Tydings–McDuffie_Act" title="wikilink">Tydings–McDuffie Act</a>, of Philippine Rehabilitation Act, and the <a href="Bell_Trade_Act" title="wikilink">Bell Trade Act</a> or Philippine Trade Act.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> Both recommendations were accepted by the Congress.</p>

<p>Manuel Roxas' term as the President of the Commonwealth ended on the morning of July 4, 1946, when the <a href="Third_Republic_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Third Republic of the Philippines</a> was inaugurated and independence from the United States proclaimed. The occasion, attended by some 300,000 people, was marked by the simultaneous lowering of the <a href="Flag_of_the_United_States" title="wikilink">Stars and Stripes</a> and raising of the <a href="Flag_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">National Flag</a>, a <a href="21-gun_salute" title="wikilink">21-gun salute</a>, and the pealing of church bells. Roxas then swore the Oath of Office as the first President of the new Republic.</p>

<p>The inaugural ceremonies took place at <a href="Luneta_Park" title="wikilink">Luneta Park</a> in the <a href="City_of_Manila" title="wikilink">City of Manila</a>.

<p>No sooner had the fanfare of the <a class="uri" href="independence" title="wikilink">independence</a> festivities ended that the government and the people quickly put all hands to work in the tasks of rescuing the country from its dire economic straits. Reputed to be the most bombed and destroyed country in the world, the Philippines was in a sorry mess. Only <a class="uri" href="Stalingrad" title="wikilink">Stalingrad</a> and <a class="uri" href="Warsaw" title="wikilink">Warsaw</a>, for instance, could compare with <a class="uri" href="Manila" title="wikilink">Manila</a> in point of destruction. All over the country more than a million people were unaccounted for. The war casualties as such could very well reach the two million mark. Conservative estimates had it that the <a class="uri" href="Philippines" title="wikilink">Philippines</a> had lost about two thirds of her material wealth.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a></p>

<p>The country was facing near bankruptcy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a> There was no national economy, no export trade. Indeed, production for exports had not been restored. On the other hand, imports were to reach the amount of three million dollars. There was need of immediate aid from the <a href="United_Nations_Relief_and_Rehabilitation_Administration" title="wikilink">United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration</a>. Something along this line was obtained. Again, loans from the United States, as well as some increase in the national revenues, were to help the new Republic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn9" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p>

<p>President Roxas, with bold steps, met the situation with the same confidence he exuded in his inaugural address, when he said: "The system of free but guided enterprise is our system". Among the main remedies proposed was the establishment of the Philippine Rehabilitation Finance Corporation. This entity would be responsible for the construction of twelve thousand houses and for the grant of easy-term loans in the amount of 177,000,000 pesos. Another proposal was the creation of the <a href="Central_Bank_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">Central Bank of the Philippines</a> to help stabilize the Philippine dollar reserves and coordinate and the nations banking activities gearing them to the economic progress.</p>

<p>Concentrating on the sugar industry, President Roxas would exert such efforts as to succeed in increasing production from 13,000 tons at the time of the Philippine liberation to an all-high of one million tons.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a></p>
<h5 id="reconstruction-after-the-war">Reconstruction after the war</h5>

<p>The <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">postwar</a> Philippines had burned cities and towns, ruined farms and factories, blasted roads and bridges, shattered industries and commerce, and thousands of massacred victims. The war had paralyzed the educational system, where 80% of the school buildings, their equipment, laboratories and furniture were destroyed.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Numberless books, invaluable documents and works of art, irreplaceable historical relics and family <a href="heirloom" title="wikilink">heirlooms</a>, hundreds of churches and temples were burned. The reconstruction of the damaged school buildings alone cost more than <a href="Philippine_peso" title="wikilink">Php</a> 126,000,000,000.</p>

<p>The new Republic began to function on an annual deficit of over Php 200,000,000 with little prospect of a balanced budget for some years to come.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="Manila" title="wikilink">Manila</a> and other cities then were infested with criminal gangs which used techniques of American <a href="gangster" title="wikilink">gangsters</a> in some activities–bank <a href="holdup" title="wikilink">holdups</a>, <a class="uri" href="kidnapping" title="wikilink">kidnapping</a> and <a href="burglar" title="wikilink">burglaries</a>.

The presidential decision did much<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> to heal a standing wound that somehow threatened to divide the people's sentiments.

<p> Although Roxas was successful in getting rehabilitation funds from the United States after independence, he was forced to concede military bases (23 of which were leased for 99 years), trade restriction for the Philippine citizens, and special privileges for U.S. property owner and investor.</p>
<h5 id="party-rights-amendment">Party Rights Amendment</h5>

<p>On March 11, 1947, Philippine voters, agreeing with Roxas, ratified in a nationwide <a class="uri" href="plebiscite" title="wikilink">plebiscite</a> the "<a href="Philippine_Parity_Rights_plebiscite,_1947" title="wikilink">parity amendment</a>" to the <a href="1935_Constitution_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">1935 Constitution of the Philippines</a>, granting United States citizens the right to dispose of and utilize Philippine natural resources, or <em><a href="parity_rights" title="wikilink">parity rights</a></em>.</p>
<h4 id="assassination-attempt">Assassination attempt</h4>

<p>The night before the plebiscite, Roxas narrowly escaped assassination by Julio Guillen, a disgruntled barber from <a href="Tondo,_Manila" title="wikilink">Tondo, Manila</a>, who hurled a <a class="uri" href="grenade" title="wikilink">grenade</a> at the platform on <a href="Plaza_Miranda" title="wikilink">Plaza Miranda</a> immediately after Roxas had addressed a rally.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="controversies">Controversies</h4>

<p>His administration was marred by graft and corruption; moreover, the abuses of the provincial military police contributed to the rise of the left-wing (Huk) movement in the countryside. His heavy-handed attempts to crush the Huks led to widespread peasant disaffection.</p>

<p>The good record of Roxas administration was marred by two failures: the failure to curb graft and corruption in the government, as evidenced by the <a href="Surplus_War_Property_scandal" title="wikilink">Surplus War Property scandal</a>, the <a href="Chinese_immigration_scandal" title="wikilink">Chinese immigration scandal</a> and the <a href="School_supplies_scandal" title="wikilink">School supplies scandal</a>; and the failure to check and stop the communist <a class="uri" href="Hukbalahap" title="wikilink">Hukbalahap</a> movement.</p>
<h2 id="death">Death</h2>

<p> Roxas did not finish his full four-year term. On the morning of April 15, 1948 Roxas delivered a speech before the United States Thirteenth Air Force. After the speech, he felt dizzy and was brought to the residence of Major General <a href="Eugene_L._Eubank" title="wikilink">E.L. Eubank</a> at <a href="Clark_Field" title="wikilink">Clark Field</a>, <a class="uri" href="Pampanga" title="wikilink">Pampanga</a>. He died later that night of a <a href="heart_attack" title="wikilink">heart attack</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a> Roxas' term as President is thus the third shortest, lasting one year, ten months, and 18 days.</p>

<p>On April 17, 1948, two days after Roxas' death, Vice-President <a href="Elpidio_Quirino" title="wikilink">Elpidio Quirino</a> took the oath of office as <a href="President_of_the_Philippines" title="wikilink">President of the Philippines</a>.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>In his honour <a href="Roxas,_Capiz" title="wikilink">Roxas, Capiz</a> and <a href="Roxas,_Isabela" title="wikilink">Roxas, Isabela</a> were named after him. <a href="Roxas_Boulevard" title="wikilink">Dewey Boulevard</a> in the <a href="City_of_Manila" title="wikilink">City of Manila</a> was renamed in his memory, and he is currently depicted on the 100 <a href="Philippine_peso" title="wikilink">Philippine peso</a> bill.</p>
