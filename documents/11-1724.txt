   Weighted space      Weighted space   In functional analysis , a weighted space is a space of functions under a weighted norm , which is a finite norm (or semi-norm) that involves multiplication by a particular function referred to as the weight .  Weights can be used to expand or reduce a space of considered functions. For example, in the space of functions from a set    U  ⊂  ℝ      U  ℝ    U\subset\mathbb{R}   to   ℝ   ℝ   \mathbb{R}   under the norm    ∥  ⋅   ∥  U      fragments  parallel-to  normal-⋅   subscript  parallel-to  U     \|\cdot\|_{U}   defined by      ∥  f  ∥   U   =    sup   x  ∈  U     |   f   (  x  )    |         subscript   norm  f   U     subscript  supremum    x  U        f  x       \|f\|_{U}=\sup_{x\in U}{|f(x)|}   , functions that have infinity as a limit point are excluded. However, the weighted norm     ∥  f  ∥   =    sup   x  ∈  U     |   f   (  x  )    1   1  +   x  2      |         norm  f     subscript  supremum    x  U        f  x    1    1   superscript  x  2          \|f\|=\sup_{x\in U}{\left|f(x)\tfrac{1}{1+x^{2}}\right|}   is finite for many more functions, so the associated space contains more functions. Alternatively, the weighted norm     ∥  f  ∥   =    sup   x  ∈  U     |   f   (  x  )    x  4    |         norm  f     subscript  supremum    x  U        f  x   superscript  x  4        \|f\|=\sup_{x\in U}{\left|f(x)x^{4}\right|}   is finite for many fewer functions.  When the weight is of the form    1   1  +   x  m        1    1   superscript  x  m      \tfrac{1}{1+x^{m}}   , the weighted space is called polynomial-weighted . 1  References       "  Category:Functional analysis     ↩
