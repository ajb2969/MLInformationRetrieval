   Eigenplane      Eigenplane   In mathematics , an eigenplane is a two- dimensional  invariant subspace in a given vector space . By analogy with the term eigenvector for a vector which, when operated on by a linear operator is another vector which is a scalar multiple of itself, the term eigenplane can be used to describe a two-dimensional plane (a 2-plane ), such that the operation of a linear operator on a vector in the 2-plane always yields another vector in the same 2-plane.  A particular case that has been studied is that in which the linear operator is an isometry  M of the hypersphere (written S 3 ) represented within four-dimensional Euclidean space :        M    [    𝐬   𝐭   ]    =    [    𝐬   𝐭   ]    Λ  θ          M   delimited-[]    𝐬  𝐭        delimited-[]    𝐬  𝐭     subscript  normal-Λ  θ      M\;[\mathbf{s}\;\mathbf{t}]\;=\;[\mathbf{s}\;\mathbf{t}]\Lambda_{\theta}     where s and t are four-dimensional column vectors and Λ θ is a two-dimensional eigenrotation within the eigenplane .  In the usual eigenvector problem, there is freedom to multiply an eigenvector by an arbitrary scalar; in this case there is freedom to multiply by an arbitrary non-zero rotation .  This case is potentially physically interesting in the case that the shape of the universe is a multiply connected  3-manifold , since finding the angles of the eigenrotations of a candidate isometry for topological lensing is a way to falsify such hypotheses.
