   Left–right symmetry      Left–right symmetry   Left–right symmetry is a general principle in physics which holds that valid physical laws must not produce a different result for a motion that is left-handed than motion that is right-handed. The most common application is expressed as equal treatment of clockwise and counter-clockwise rotations from a fixed frame of reference.  The general principle is often referred to by the name chiral symmetry . The rule is absolutely valid in the classical mechanics of Newton and Einstein , but results from quantum mechanical experiments show a difference in the behavior of left-chiral versus right-chiral subatomic particles .  Particle Physics  In theoretical physics , the electroweak model breaks parity maximally. All its fermions are chiral  Weyl fermions , which means that the charged weak gauge bosons only couple to left-handed quarks and leptons. (Note that the neutral electroweak Z boson already couples to left and right-handed fermions.) Some theorists found this objectionable, and so proposed a GUT extension of the weak force which has new, high energy W' and Z' bosons which couple with right handed quarks and leptons.

Here, SU(2) L (pronounced SU(2) left) is none other than SU(2) W and B−L is the baryon number minus the lepton number . An advantage of this model over the Standard Model is that the electric charge formula in this model is given by      Q  =    I   3  L    +   I   3  R    +    B  -  L   2        Q     subscript  I    3  L     subscript  I    3  R        B  L   2      Q=I_{3L}+I_{3R}+\frac{B-L}{2}   ;  where     I     3  L   ,  R      subscript  I     3  L   R     \!I_{3L,R}   are the weak isospin values of the fields in the theory.  There is also the chromodynamic SU(3) C . The idea was to restore parity by introducing a left-right symmetry . This is a group extension of Z 2 (the left-right symmetry) by             S  U    (  3  )   C    ×  S   U    (  2  )   L    ×  S   U    (  2  )   R    ×  U     (  1  )    B  -  L      ℤ  6                     S  U   subscript  3  C    S   U   subscript  2  L    S   U   subscript  2  R    U    subscript  1    B  L      subscript  ℤ  6     {SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}\times U(1)_{B-L}\over\mathbb{Z}_{6}}     to the semidirect product               S  U    (  3  )   C    ×  S   U    (  2  )   L    ×  S   U    (  2  )   R    ×  U     (  1  )    B  -  L      ℤ  6    ⋊   ℤ  2    .     right-normal-factor-semidirect-product                  S  U   subscript  3  C    S   U   subscript  2  L    S   U   subscript  2  R    U    subscript  1    B  L      subscript  ℤ  6     subscript  ℤ  2     {SU(3)_{C}\times SU(2)_{L}\times SU(2)_{R}\times U(1)_{B-L}\over\mathbb{Z}_{6}%
 }\rtimes\mathbb{Z}_{2}.     This has two connected components where Z 2 acts as an automorphism , which is the composition of an involutive  outer automorphism of SU(3) C with the interchange of the left and right copies of SU(2) with the reversal of U(1) B−L . It was shown by Rabindra N. Mohapatra and Goran Senjanovic in 1975 that left-right symmetry can be spontaneously broken to give a chiral low energy theory, which is the Standard Model of Glashow, Weinberg and Salam and it also connects the small observed neutrino masses to the breaking of left-right symmetry via the seesaw mechanism .  In this setting the chiral quarks   (3,2,1) 1/3    and       (   3  ¯   ,  1  ,  2  )    -   1  3       subscript    normal-¯  3   1  2       1  3      (\bar{3},1,2)_{-{1\over 3}}     are unified into an irrep         (  3  ,  2  ,  1  )    1  3    ⊕    (   3  ¯   ,  1  ,  2  )    -   1  3      .     direct-sum   subscript   3  2  1     1  3     subscript    normal-¯  3   1  2       1  3       (3,2,1)_{1\over 3}\oplus(\bar{3},1,2)_{-{1\over 3}}.     The leptons are also unified into an irrep         (  1  ,  2  ,  1  )    -  1    ⊕    (  1  ,  1  ,  2  )   1    .     direct-sum   subscript   1  2  1     1     subscript   1  1  2   1     (1,2,1)_{-1}\oplus(1,1,2)_{1}.     The Higgs bosons needed to implement the breaking of left-right symmetry down to the Standard Model are         (  1  ,  3  ,  1  )   2   ⊕    (  1  ,  1  ,  3  )   2    .     direct-sum   subscript   1  3  1   2    subscript   1  1  3   2     (1,3,1)_{2}\oplus(1,1,3)_{2}.     This then predicts three sterile neutrinos , which is perfectly consistent with neutrino oscillation data. Within the seesaw mechanism, the sterile neutrinos become superheavy without affecting physics at low energies.  Because the left-right symmetry is spontaneously broken, left-right models predict domain walls .  This left-right symmetry idea first appeared in the Pati–Salam model (1974), Mohapatra–Pati models (1975) and later in trinification (1984).  "  Category:Particle physics  Category:Symmetry
