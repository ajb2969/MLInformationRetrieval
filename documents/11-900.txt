   Flavonol-3-O-beta-glucoside O-malonyltransferase      Flavonol-3-O-beta-glucoside O-malonyltransferase   In enzymology , a flavonol-3-O-beta-glucoside O-malonyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   malonyl-CoA + flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + flavonol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-D-glucoside)   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are malonyl-CoA and flavonol 3-O-beta-D-glucoside , whereas its two products are CoA and flavonol 3-O-(6-O-malonyl-beta-D-glucoside) .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is malonyl-CoA:flavonol-3-O-beta-D-glucoside 6"-O-malonyltransferase . Other names in common use include flavonol 3-O-glucoside malonyltransferase , MAT-3 , and malonyl-coenzyme A:flavonol-3-O-glucoside malonyltransferase .
