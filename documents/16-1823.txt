Ultra-Small World is a property of Scale-free network that relates to the impact that hubs have in the small-world property of a network. In networks that contain this property, hubs radically reduce the path length, because they act as bridges between many small degree nodes. They do so by linking to a large number of small-degree nodes, creating short distances between them. According to Cohen and Havlin, scale-free networks with 2<λL \propto \log \log N can be considered as "ultra small-world" networks.1. They are that way because they have not achieved the critical point, where 3<λ. At this point, the lnN dependence encountered for random networks returns. 2
Cohen and Havlin argue that the scaling they propose is the general case of scale-free networks, and the process of the construction of the network can be seen by following links one at a time. Their analysis shows that scale-free graphs have diameter 
 
 
 
 , which is smaller than the 
 
 
 
  behavior, expected for regular random graphs. For every 2<λ scale-free graphs can be built to have a diameter of order 
 
 
 
 . If random scale-free graphs are considered, only for 2<λL \propto \log \log N is obtained, while for 3<λ the result remains as 
 
 
 
 .
