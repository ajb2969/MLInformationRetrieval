   Narumi polynomials      Narumi polynomials   In mathematics, the Narumi polynomials  s n ( x ) are polynomials introduced by  given by the generating function       âˆ‘     s  n    (  x  )    t  n    /   n  !     =     (   t   log   (   1  +  t   )     )   a     (   1  +  t   )   x               subscript  s  n   x   superscript  t  n      n        superscript    t      1  t     a    superscript    1  t   x      \displaystyle\sum s_{n}(x)t^{n}/n!=\left(\frac{t}{\log(1+t)}\right)^{a}(1+t)^{x}   ,  See also   Umbral calculus   References      Reprinted by Dover, 2005   "  Category:Polynomials
