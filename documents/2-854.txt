Big Rip




Big Rip

The Big Rip is a cosmological hypothesis first published in 2003, about the ultimate fate of the universe, in which the matter of the universe, from stars and galaxies to atoms and subatomic particles, is progressively torn apart by the expansion of the universe at a certain time in the future. According to the hypothesis, the scale factor of the universe and with it all distances in the universe will become infinite at a finite time in the future. The possibility of sudden singularities and crunch or rip singularities at late times occur only for hypothetical matter with implausible physical properties.1
Definition and overview
The hypothesis relies crucially on the type of dark energy in the universe. The key value is the equation of state parameter 
 
 
 
 , the ratio between the dark energy pressure and its energy density. If 
 
 
 
  t_{rip} - t_{0} \approx \frac{2}{3|1+w|H_0\sqrt{1-\Omega_m}}
where 
 
 
 
  is defined above, H0 is Hubble's constant and Ωm is the present value of the density of all the matter in the universe.
In their paper, the authors consider an example with 
 
 
 
 
  = −1.5, H0 = 70 km/s/Mpc and Ωm = 0.3, in which case the end of the universe is approximately 22 billion years from the present. This is not considered a prediction, but a hypothetical example. The authors note that evidence indicates 
 
 
 
  to be very close to −1 in our universe, which makes 
 
 
 
  the dominating term in the equation. The closer that 
 
 
 
  is to −1, the closer the denominator is to zero and the further the Big Rip is in the future. If 
 
 
 
  were exactly equal to −1, the Big Rip could not happen, regardless of the values of H0 or Ωm.
In their scenario for 
 
 
 
 
  = −1.5, the galaxies would first be separated from each other. About 60 million years before the end, gravity would be too weak to hold the Milky Way and other individual galaxies together. Approximately three months before the end, the Solar System (or systems similar to our own at this time, as the fate of the Solar System 22 billion years in the future is questionable) would be gravitationally unbound. In the last minutes, stars and planets would be torn apart, and an instant before the end, atoms would be destroyed.2
Experimental data
According to the latest cosmological data available, the uncertainties are still too large to discriminate among the three cases 
 
 
 
  w = −1, and 
 
 
 
  > −1.34
