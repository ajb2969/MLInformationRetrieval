   Carey Foster bridge      Carey Foster bridge   In electronics , the Carey Foster bridge is a bridge circuit used to measure low resistances, or to measure small differences between two large resistances. It was invented by Carey Foster as a variant on the Wheatstone bridge . He first described it in his 1872 paper "On a Modified Form of Wheatstone's Bridge, and Methods of Measuring Small Resistances" ( Telegraph Engineer's Journal , 1872–1873, 1, 196).  Use  (Figure)  The Carey Foster bridge. The thick-edged areas are busbars of almost zero resistance.   In the diagram to the right, X and Y are resistances to be compared. P and Q are nearly equal resistances, forming the other half of the bridge. The bridge wire EF has a jockey contact D placed along it and is slid until the galvanometer G measures zero. The thick-bordered areas are thick copper busbars of almost zero resistance.   Place a known resistance in position Y.  Place the unknown resistance in position X.  Adjust the contact D along the bridge wire EF so as to null the galvanometer. This position (as a percentage of distance from E to F) is .  Swap X and Y. Adjust D to the new null point. This position is .  If the resistance of the wire per percentage is   σ   σ   σ   , then the resistance difference is the resistance of the length of bridge wire between and :          X  -  Y   =   σ   (    l  2   -   l  1    )          X  Y     σ     subscript  l  2    subscript  l  1       {X-Y=\sigma(l_{2}-l_{1})}\,        To measure a low unknown resistance X, replace Y with a copper busbar that can be assumed to be of zero resistance.  In practical use, when the bridge is unbalanced, the galvanometer is shunted with a low resistance to avoid burning it out. It is only used at full sensitivity when the anticipated measurement is close to the null point.  To measure σ  To measure the unit resistance of the bridge wire EF, put a known resistance (e.g., a standard 1 ohm resistance) that is less than that of the wire as X, and a copper busbar of assumed zero resistance as Y.  Theory  Two resistances to be compared, X and Y, are connected in series with the bridge wire. Thus, considered as a Wheatstone bridge, the two resistances are X plus a length of bridge wire, and Y plus the remaining bridge wire. The two remaining arms are the nearly equal resistances P and Q, connected in the inner gaps of the bridge.  Let be the null point D on the bridge wire EF in percent.   α   α   α   is the unknown left-side extra resistance EX and   β   β   β   is the unknown right-side extra resistance FY, and   σ   σ   σ   is the resistance per percent length of the bridge wire:       P  Q   =    X  +   σ   (    l  1   +  α   )      Y  +   σ   (    100  -   l  1    +  β   )            P  Q       X    σ     subscript  l  1   α       Y    σ      100   subscript  l  1    β        {P\over Q}={{X+\sigma(l_{1}+\alpha)}\over{Y+\sigma(100-l_{1}+\beta)}}     and add 1 to each side:        P  Q   +  1   =    X  +  Y  +   σ   (   100  +  α  +  β   )      Y  +   σ   (    100  -   l  1    +  β   )              P  Q   1       X  Y    σ    100  α  β       Y    σ      100   subscript  l  1    β        {{P\over Q}+1}={{X+Y+\sigma(100+\alpha+\beta)}\over{Y+\sigma(100-l_{1}+\beta)}}    (equation 1)  Now swap X and Y. is the new null point reading in percent:       P  Q   =    Y  +   σ   (    l  2   +  α   )      X  +   σ   (    100  -   l  2    +  β   )            P  Q       Y    σ     subscript  l  2   α       X    σ      100   subscript  l  2    β        {P\over Q}={{Y+\sigma(l_{2}+\alpha)}\over{X+\sigma(100-l_{2}+\beta)}}     and add 1 to each side:        P  Q   +  1   =    X  +  Y  +   σ   (   100  +  α  +  β   )      X  +   σ   (    100  -   l  2    +  β   )              P  Q   1       X  Y    σ    100  α  β       X    σ      100   subscript  l  2    β        {{P\over Q}+1}={{X+Y+\sigma(100+\alpha+\beta)}\over{X+\sigma(100-l_{2}+\beta)}}    (equation 2)  Equations 1 and 2 have the same left-hand side and the same numerator on the right-hand side, meaning the denominator on the right-hand side must also be equal:       Y  ;   +   σ   (    100  -   l  1    +  β   )      =   X  +   σ   (    100  -   l  2    +  β   )          Y      σ      100   subscript  l  1    β        X    σ      100   subscript  l  2    β       \displaystyle Y;+\sigma(100-l_{1}+\beta)=X+\sigma(100-l_{2}+\beta)     Thus: the difference between X and Y is the resistance of the bridge wire between and .  The bridge is most sensitive when P, Q, X and Y are all of comparable magnitude.
