Natural pseudodistance

In size theory, the natural pseudodistance between two size pairs

 
 , 
 
 
 
  is the value 
 
 
 
 , where 
 
 
 
  varies in the set of all homeomorphisms from the manifold 
 
 
 
  to the manifold 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  is the supremum norm. If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are not homeomorphic, then the natural pseudodistance is defined to be 
 
 
 
 . It is usually assumed that 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  are 
 
 
closed manifolds and the measuring functions

 
  are 
 
 
 
 . Put another way, the natural pseudodistance measures the infimum of the change of the measuring function induced by the homeomorphisms from 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 .
The concept of natural pseudodistance can be easily extended to size pairs where the measuring function 
 
 
 
  takes values in 
 
 
 
  .1
Main properties
It can be proved 2 that the natural pseudodistance always equals the Euclidean distance between two critical values of the measuring functions (possibly, of the same measuring function) divided by a suitable positive integer 
 
 
 
 . If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are surfaces, the number 
 
 
 
  can be assumed to be 
 
 
 
 , 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .3 If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are curves, the number 
 
 
 
  can be assumed to be 
 
 
 
  or 
 
 
 
 .4 If an optimal homeomorphism 
 
 
 
  exists (i.e., 
 
 
 
 ), then 
 
 
 
  can be assumed to be 
 
 
 
 .5
