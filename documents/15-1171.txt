   Biflaviolin synthase      Biflaviolin synthase   Biflaviolin synthase (, CYP158A2 , CYP 158A2 , cytochrome P450 158A2 ) is an enzyme with system name flaviolin,NADPH:oxygen oxidoreductase . 1 2 3 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   (1) 2 flaviolin + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3,3'-biflaviolin + NADP + + 2 H 2 O  (2) 2 flaviolin + NADPH + H + + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3,8'-biflaviolin + NADP + + 2 H 2 O   This cytochrome P450 enzyme, from the soil-dwelling bacterium  Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2), catalyses a phenol  oxidation C-C coupling reaction.
