   K-factor (marketing)      K-factor (marketing)   In viral marketing , the K-factor can be used to describe the growth rate of websites, apps , or a customer base. 1 The formula is roughly as follows: 2      i  =  number of invites sent by each customer      i  number of invites sent by each customer    i=\text{number of invites sent by each customer }   (e.g. if each new customer invites five friends, i = 5)      c  =  percent conversion of each invite      c  percent conversion of each invite    c=\text{percent conversion of each invite }   (e.g. if one in five invitees convert to new users, c = .2)      k  =   i  *  c       k    i  c     k=i*c     This usage is borrowed from the medical field of epidemiology in which a virus having a k-factor of 1 is in a "steady" state of neither growth nor decline, while a k-factor greater than 1 indicates exponential growth and a k-factor less than 1 indicates exponential decline. The k-factor in this context is itself a product of the rates of distribution and infection for an app (or virus). "Distribution" measures the average number of people a host will contact while still infectious, and "infection" measures how likely an average person is to also become infected after contact with a viral host. 3  References  "  Category:Viral marketing  Category:Definition     ↩  ↩  ↩
