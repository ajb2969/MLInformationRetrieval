   Moving sofa problem      Moving sofa problem   (Figure)  The Hammersley sofa has area 2.2074... but is not the largest solution   The moving sofa problem was formulated by the Austrian-Canadian mathematician Leo Moser in 1966. The problem is a two-dimensional idealisation of real-life furniture moving problems, and asks for the rigid two-dimensional shape of largest area A that can be maneuvered through an L-shaped planar region with legs of unit width. The area A thus obtained is referred to as the sofa constant . The exact value of the sofa constant is an open problem .  Lower and upper bounds  As a semicircular disk of unit radius can pass through the corner, a lower bound for the sofa constant     A   ≥   π  /   2    ≈  1.570796327        A    π  2        1.570796327     \scriptstyle A\,\geq\,\pi/2\,\approx\,1.570796327   is readily obtained.  John Hammersley derived a considerably higher lower bound     A   ≥    π  /  2   +   2  /   π     ≈  2.207416099        A      π  2     2  π         2.207416099     \scriptstyle A\,\geq\,\pi/2+2/\pi\,\approx\,2.207416099   based on a handset -type shape consisting of two quarter-circles of radius 1 on either side of a 1 by 4/π rectangle from which a semicircle of radius    2  /   π       2  π    \scriptstyle 2/\pi\,   has been removed. 1 2  Joseph Gerver found a sofa that further increased the lower bound for the sofa constant to 2.219531669. 3 4  In a different direction, an easy argument by Hammersley shows that the sofa constant is at most     2    2     ≈  2.8284        2    2    2.8284    \scriptstyle 2\sqrt{2}\,\approx\,2.8284   . 5 6  See also   Mountain climbing problem  Moser's worm problem   References  "  Category:Discrete geometry  Category:Unsolved problems in mathematics  Category:Recreational mathematics     ↩  Moving Sofa Constant by Steven Finch at MathSoft, includes a diagram of Gerver's sofa ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩  ↩
