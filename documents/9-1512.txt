The moving sofa problem was formulated by the Austrian-Canadian mathematician Leo Moser in 1966. The problem is a two-dimensional idealisation of real-life furniture moving problems, and asks for the rigid two-dimensional shape of largest area A that can be maneuvered through an L-shaped planar region with legs of unit width. The area A thus obtained is referred to as the sofa constant. The exact value of the sofa constant is an open problem.
Lower and upper bounds
As a semicircular disk of unit radius can pass through the corner, a lower bound for the sofa constant 
 
 
 
  is readily obtained.
John Hammersley derived a considerably higher lower bound 
 
 
 
  based on a handset-type shape consisting of two quarter-circles of radius 1 on either side of a 1 by 4/π rectangle from which a semicircle of radius 
 
 
 
  has been removed.12
Joseph Gerver found a sofa that further increased the lower bound for the sofa constant to 2.219531669.34
In a different direction, an easy argument by Hammersley shows that the sofa constant is at most 
 
 
 
 .56
