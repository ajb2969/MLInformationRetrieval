N-acylglucosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase




N-acylglucosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase

In enzymology, a N-acylglucosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

N-acyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate 
 
 
 
  N-acyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphate
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, N-acyl-D-glucosamine 6-phosphate, and one product, N-acyl-D-mannosamine 6-phosphate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of isomerases, specifically those racemases and epimerases acting on carbohydrates and derivatives. The systematic name of this enzyme class is N-acyl-D-glucosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase. Other names in common use include acylglucosamine-6-phosphate 2-epimerase, and acylglucosamine phosphate 2-epimerase. This enzyme participates in aminosugars metabolism.
