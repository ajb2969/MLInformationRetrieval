   Draft:Geometry of an algebraic curve      Draft:Geometry of an algebraic curve   Arithmetic of an algebraic curve (e.g., rationa points) is outside the scope of the article (would require another Wikipedia article; but see arithmetic surface and other articles.) In fact, we will work over the complex numbers, which allow us to use the Hodge theory . Especially in the context of degeneration/deformation of curves, it is imperative to talk about "reducible" curves with singularities.  Genus of a stable curve  Proof: Let     X  i   ~     normal-~   subscript  X  i     \widetilde{X_{i}}   be the normalization of an irreducible component    X  i     subscript  X  i    X_{i}   of X . Then, by the Riemann–Roch formula,        χ   (   𝒪  X   )    =     ∑  1  ν    χ   (   𝒪    X  i   ~    )     +  δ   =     ∑  1  ν    (   1  -   g  i    )    +  δ    .          χ   subscript  𝒪  X        superscript   subscript   1   ν     χ   subscript  𝒪   normal-~   subscript  X  i       δ            superscript   subscript   1   ν     1   subscript  g  i     δ      \chi(\mathcal{O}_{X})=\sum_{1}^{\nu}\chi(\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{X_{i}}})+%
 \delta=\sum_{1}^{\nu}(1-g_{i})+\delta.     Line bundles and dual graph  Let X be a possibly singular curve. Then      0  →   ℂ  *   →    (   ℂ  *   )   r   →   Γ   (  X  ,  ℱ  )    →   Pic   (  X  )    →   Pic   (   X  ~   )    →  0.       normal-→  0   superscript  ℂ      normal-→     superscript   superscript  ℂ    r     normal-→      normal-Γ   X  ℱ      normal-→     Pic  X     normal-→     Pic   normal-~  X      normal-→    0.     0\to\mathbb{C}^{*}\to(\mathbb{C}^{*})^{r}\to\Gamma(X,\mathcal{F})\to%
 \operatorname{Pic}(X)\to\operatorname{Pic}(\widetilde{X})\to 0.   where r is the number of irreducible components of X ,    π  :    X  ~   →  X      normal-:  π   normal-→   normal-~  X   X     \pi:\widetilde{X}\to X   is the normalization and    ℱ  =     π  *    𝒪   X  ~     /   𝒪  X        ℱ       subscript  π     subscript  𝒪   normal-~  X      subscript  𝒪  X      \mathcal{F}=\pi_{*}\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{X}}/\mathcal{O}_{X}   . (To get this use the fact     Pic   (  X  )    =    H  1    (  X  ,   𝒪  X  *   )         Pic  X     superscript  normal-H  1   X   superscript   subscript  𝒪  X        \operatorname{Pic}(X)=\operatorname{H}^{1}(X,\mathcal{O}_{X}^{*})   and      Pic   (   X  ~   )    =    H  1    (   X  ~   ,   𝒪   X  ~   *   )    =    H  1    (  X  ,    π  *    𝒪   X  ~   *    )     .         Pic   normal-~  X      superscript  normal-H  1    normal-~  X    superscript   subscript  𝒪   normal-~  X              superscript  normal-H  1   X     subscript  π     superscript   subscript  𝒪   normal-~  X           \operatorname{Pic}(\widetilde{X})=\operatorname{H}^{1}(\widetilde{X},\mathcal{%
 O}_{\widetilde{X}}^{*})=\operatorname{H}^{1}(X,\pi_{*}\mathcal{O}_{\widetilde{%
 X}}^{*}).   )  Taking the long exact sequence of the exponential sheaf sequence gives the degree map:      deg  :    Pic   (  X  )    →    H  2    (  X  ;  ℤ  )    ≃   ℤ  r       normal-:  deg     normal-→   Pic  X     superscript  normal-H  2   X  ℤ     similar-to-or-equals     superscript  ℤ  r       \operatorname{deg}:\operatorname{Pic}(X)\to\operatorname{H}^{2}(X;\mathbb{Z})%
 \simeq\mathbb{Z}^{r}   . By definition, the Jacobian variety  J ( X ) of X is the identity component of the kernel of this map. Then the previous exact sequence gives:      0  →   ℂ  *   →    (   ℂ  *   )   r   →   Γ   (   X  ~   ,  ℱ  )    →   J   (  X  )    →   J   (   X  ~   )    →  0.       normal-→  0   superscript  ℂ      normal-→     superscript   superscript  ℂ    r     normal-→      normal-Γ    normal-~  X   ℱ      normal-→      J  X     normal-→      J   normal-~  X      normal-→    0.     0\to\mathbb{C}^{*}\to(\mathbb{C}^{*})^{r}\to\Gamma(\widetilde{X},\mathcal{F})%
 \to J(X)\to J(\widetilde{X})\to 0.     We next define the dual graph of X ; a one-dimensional CW complex defined as follows. (related to whether a curve is of compact type or not)  Flat families of curves  By which we mean      π  :   𝒳  →  S      normal-:  π   normal-→  𝒳  S     \pi:\mathcal{X}\to S   such that      π   π   \pi   is flat (but need not be proper)       π   -  1     (  t  )        superscript  π    1    t    \pi^{-1}(t)   is a smooth curve for all t ≠ 0.   By the degeneration or specialization as t → 0 we mean  Automorphism group  The automorphism group of a smooth curve of genus g had order at most 84( g -1)  Vanishing sequence  Given a linear series V on a curve X , the image of it under    ord  p     subscript  ord  p    \operatorname{ord}_{p}   is a finite set and following the tradition we write it as         a  0    (  V  ,  p  )    <    a  1    (  V  ,  p  )    <   ⋯   a  r    (  V  ,  p  )     .           subscript  a  0    V  p       subscript  a  1    V  p           normal-⋯   subscript  a  r    V  p       a_{0}(V,p)   This sequence is called the vanishing sequence. For example,     a  0    (  V  ,  p  )        subscript  a  0    V  p     a_{0}(V,p)   is the multiplicity of a base point p . We think of higher     a  i    (  V  ,  p  )        subscript  a  i    V  p     a_{i}(V,p)   as encoding information about inflection of the Kodaira map     ϕ  V     subscript  ϕ  V    \phi_{V}   . The ramification sequence is then        b  i    (  V  ,  p  )    =     a  i    (  V  ,  p  )    -  i          subscript  b  i    V  p         subscript  a  i    V  p    i     b_{i}(V,p)=a_{i}(V,p)-i   . Their sum is called the ramification index of p . The global ramification is given by the famous formula:  Hurwitz scheme  By definition, Hurwitz scheme    ℋ   d  ,  g      subscript  ℋ   d  g     \mathcal{H}_{d,g}   is the scheme parametrizing pairs (     C  ,  π   :   C  →   𝐏  1       normal-:   C  π    normal-→  C   superscript  𝐏  1      C,\pi:C\to\mathbf{P}^{1}   ) where C is a smooth curve of genus g and π has degree d .  Severi variety  A variety in a Hilbert scheme that parametrizes curves in projective space with given degree and geometric genus and at most node singularities. Its dimension is 3 d +g-1.  It is a difficult theorem that Severi variety is a variety; I.e., irreducible.
