   Alpha-factor-transporting ATPase      Alpha-factor-transporting ATPase   In enzymology , an alpha-factor-transporting ATPase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + H 2 O + alpha-factorin   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + phosphate + alpha-factorout   The 3 substrates of this enzyme are ATP , H 2 O , and alpha-factor , whereas its 3 products are ADP , phosphate , and alpha-factor .  This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases , specifically those acting on acid anhydrides to catalyse transmembrane movement of substances. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP phosphohydrolase (alpha-factor-transporting) .  References      "  Category:EC 3.6.3  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
