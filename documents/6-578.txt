Maximilien Toepler

Maximilien Topler (1870â€“1960) was a German physicist known for his work on electrostatics, sparks and Schlieren photography. His father was the physicist August Toepler.
Toepler's law (1906) states that the resistance of an electric arc at any time is inversely proportional to the charge which has flowed through the arc:



where I(t) is the current in the arc discharge at time t, and D is the gap between the electrodes. The parameter 
 
 
 
  is a constant whose value is 
 
 
 
 .
