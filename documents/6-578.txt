   Maximilien Toepler      Maximilien Toepler   Maximilien Topler (1870–1960) was a German physicist known for his work on electrostatics , sparks and Schlieren photography . His father was the physicist August Toepler .  Toepler's law (1906) states that the resistance of an electric arc at any time is inversely proportional to the charge which has flowed through the arc:       R   (  t  )    =     k  T   D     ∫  0  t    I   (  t  )   d  t           R  t        subscript  k  T   D     superscript   subscript   0   t     I  t  d  t       R(t)={\frac{k_{T}D}{\int_{0}^{t}I(t)\,dt}}     where I(t) is the current in the arc discharge at time t , and D is the gap between the electrodes. The parameter    k  T     subscript  k  T    k_{T}   is a constant whose value is      4  ×    10   -  3      V   ⋅  s  ⋅   m   -  1       normal-⋅      4   superscript  10    3     V   s   superscript  m    1      4\times 10^{-3}\,V\cdot s\cdot m^{-1}   .
