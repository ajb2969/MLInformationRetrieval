   Jacobi's four-square theorem      Jacobi's four-square theorem   Jacobi's four-square theorem gives a formula for the number of ways that a given positive integer n can be represented as the sum of four squares.  History  The theorem was proved in 1834 by Carl Gustav Jakob Jacobi .  Theorem  Two representations are considered different if their terms are in different order or if the integer being squared (not just the square) is different; to illustrate, these are three of the eight different ways to represent 1:       1  2   +   0  2   +   0  2   +   0  2        superscript  1  2    superscript  0  2    superscript  0  2    superscript  0  2     \displaystyle 1^{2}+0^{2}+0^{2}+0^{2}     The number of ways to represent n as the sum of four squares is eight times the sum of the divisors of n if n is odd and 24 times the sum of the odd divisors of n if n is even (see divisor function ), i.e.        r  4    (  n  )    =   {      8     ∑   m  |  n     m       if  n  is odd        24     ∑      m  |  n        m  odd        m        if  n  is even   .              subscript  r  4   n    cases    8    subscript    fragments  m  normal-|  n    m      if  n  is odd     24    subscript      fragments  m  normal-|  n       m  odd      m      if  n  is even      r_{4}(n)=\begin{cases}8\sum\limits_{m|n}m&\text{if }n\text{ is odd}\\
 24\sum\limits_{\begin{smallmatrix}m|n\\
 m\text{ odd}\end{smallmatrix}}m&\text{if }n\text{ is even}.\end{cases}     Equivalently, it is eight times the sum of all its divisors which are not divisible by 4, i.e.         r  4    (  n  )    =   8    ∑    m   :  4  ∤  m  |  n    m     .         subscript  r  4   n     8    subscript    fragments  m  normal-:  4  not-divides  m  normal-|  n    m      r_{4}(n)=8\sum_{m\,:\,4\nmid m|n}m.     In particular, for a prime number  p we have the explicit formula r 4 ( p ) = 8( p + 1).  Proof  The proof shows that the Theta series for the lattice  Z 4 is a modular form of a certain level, and hence equals a linear combination of Eisenstein series .
