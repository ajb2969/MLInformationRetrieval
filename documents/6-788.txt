Kan extension

Kan extensions are universal constructs in category theory, a branch of mathematics. They are closely related to adjoints, but are also related to limits and ends. They are named after Daniel M. Kan, who constructed certain (Kan) extensions using limits in 1960.
An early use of (what is now known as) a Kan extension from 1956 was in homological algebra to compute derived functors.
In Categories for the Working Mathematician Saunders Mac Lane titled a section "All Concepts Are Kan Extensions", and went on to write that

The notion of Kan extensions subsumes all the other fundamental concepts of category theory.
 

Kan extensions generalize the notion of extending a function defined on a subset to a function defined on the whole set. The definition, not surprisingly, is at a high level of abstraction. When specialised to posets, it becomes a relatively familiar type of question on 'constrained optimization'.
Definition
A Kan extension proceeds from the data of three categories



and two functors


 
 ,
and comes in two varieties: the "left" Kan extension and the "right" Kan extension of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
 .
It amounts to finding the dashed arrow and the 2-cell 
 
 
 
  in the following diagram:

Right Kan Extension




Formally, the right Kan extension of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 consists of a functor 
 
 
 
  and a natural transformation 
 
 
 
  which is couniversal with respect to the specification, in the sense that for any functor 
 
 
 
  and natural transformation 
 
 
 
 , a unique natural transformation 
 
 
 
  is defined and fits into a commutative diagram

(where 
 
 
 
  is the natural transformation with 
 
 
 
  for any object 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 ).


The functor R is often written 
 
 
 
 .
As with the other universal constructs in category theory, the "left" version of the Kan extension is dual to the "right" one and is obtained by replacing all categories by their opposites. The effect of this on the description above is merely to reverse the direction of the natural transformations (recall that a natural transformation

 
  between the functors 
 
 
 
  consists of the data of an arrow 
 
 
 
  for every object 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 , satisfying a "naturality" property. When we pass to the opposite categories, the source and target of 
 
 
 
  are swapped, causing 
 
 
 
  to act in the opposite direction).
This gives rise to the alternate description: the left Kan extension of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 consists of a functor 
 
 
 
  and a natural transformation 
 
 
 
  which are universal with respect to this specification, in the sense that for any other functor 
 
 
 
  and natural transformation 
 
 
 
 , a unique natural transformation 
 
 
 
  exists and fits into a commutative diagram:

(where 
 
 
 
  is the natural transformation with 
 
 
 
  for any object 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
 ).


The functor L is often written 
 
 
 
 .
The use of the word "the" (as in "the left Kan extension") is justified by the fact that, as with all universal constructions, if the object defined exists, then it is unique up to unique isomorphism. In this case, that means that (for left Kan extensions) if 
 
 
 
  are two left Kan extensions of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  are the corresponding transformations, then there exists a unique isomorphism of functors 
 
 
 
  such that the second diagram above commutes. Likewise for right Kan extensions.
Properties
Kan extensions as (co)limits
Suppose that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  are two functors. If A is small and C is cocomplete, then there exists a left Kan extension 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
 , defined at each object b of B by



where the colimit is taken over the comma category

 
 .
Dually, if A is small and C is complete, then right Kan extensions along 
 
 
 
  exist, and can be computed as limits.
Kan extensions as coends
Suppose that


 
  and 
 
 

are two functors such that for all objects m and m' of M and all objects c of C, the copowers

 
  exist in A. Then the functor T has a left Kan extension L along K, which is such that, for every object c of C,



when the above coend exists for every object c of C.
Dually, right Kan extensions can be computed by the formula


 
 .
Limits as Kan extensions
The limit of a functor 
 
 
 
  can be expressed as a Kan extension by



where 
 
 
 
  is the unique functor from 
 
 
 
  to  ï¿½ (the category with one object and one arrow, a terminal object in 
 
 
 
 ). The colimit of 
 
 
 
  can be expressed similarly by


 
 .
Adjoints as Kan extensions
A functor 
 
 
 
  possesses a left adjoint if and only if the right Kan extension of 
 
 
 
  along 
 
 
 
  exists and is preserved by 
 
 
 
 . In this case, a left adjoint is given by 
 
 
 
  and this Kan extension is even preserved by any functor 
 
 
 
  whatsoever, i.e. is an absolute Kan extension.
Dually, a right adjoint exists if and only if the left Kan extension of the identity along 
 
 
 
  exists and is preserved by 
 
 
 
 .
