   Conditional probability      Conditional probability   In probability theory , a conditional probability measures the probability of an event given that (by assumption, presumption, assertion or evidence) another event has occurred. 1 If the event of interest is A and the event B is known or assumed to have occurred, "the conditional probability of A given B ", or "the probability of A under the condition B ", is usually written as P ( A | B ), or sometimes P $_{ B }$ ( A ). For example, the probability that any given person has a cough on any given day may be only 5%. But if we know or assume that the person has a cold , then they are much more likely to be coughing. The conditional probability of coughing given that you have a cold might be a much higher 75%.  The concept of conditional probability is one of the most fundamental and one of the most important concepts in probability theory. 2 But conditional probabilities can be quite slippery and require careful interpretation. 3 For example, there need not be a causal or temporal relationship between A and B .  P ( A | B ) may or may not be equal to P ( A ) (the unconditional probability of A ). If P ( A | B ) = P ( A ), then A and B are said to be independent. Also, in general, P ( A | B ) (the conditional probability of A given B) is not equal to P ( B | A ). For example, if you have cancer you might have a 90% chance of testing positive for cancer, but if you test positive for cancer you might have only a 10% chance of actually having cancer because cancer is very rare. Falsely equating the two probabilities causes various errors of reasoning such as the base rate fallacy . Conditional probabilities can be correctly reversed using Bayes' theorem .  Definition  (Figure)  Illustration of conditional probabilities with an Euler diagram . The unconditional probability  P ( A ) = 0.52. However, the conditional probability P ( A | B $_{ 1 }$ ) = 1, P ( A | B $_{ 2 }$ ) ≈ 0.75, and P ( A | B $_{ 3 }$ ) = 0.   (Figure)  On a tree diagram , branch probabilities are conditional on the event associated with the parent node.   (Figure)  Venn Pie Chart describing conditional probabilities   Conditioning on an event  Kolmogorov definition  Given two events  A and B from the sigma-field of a probability space with P ( B ) > 0, the conditional probability of A given B is defined as the quotient of the probability of the joint of events A and B , and the probability of B :  $$P(A|B) = \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}$$  This may be visualized as restricting the sample space to B . The logic behind this equation is that if the outcomes are restricted to B , this set serves as the new sample space.  Note that this is a definition but not a theoretical result. We just denote the quantity $P(A\cap B)/P(B)$ as $P(A|B)$ and call it the conditional probability of A given B .  As an axiom of probability  Some authors, such as De Finetti , prefer to introduce conditional probability as an axiom of probability :  $$P(A \cap B) = P(A|B)P(B)$$  Although mathematically equivalent, this may be preferred philosophically; under major probability interpretations such as the subjective theory , conditional probability is considered a primitive entity. Further, this "multiplication axiom" introduces a symmetry with the summation axiom for mutually exclusive events : 4  $$P(A \cup B) = P(A) + P(B) - \cancelto0{P(A \cap B)}$$  Definition with σ-algebra  If P ( B ) = 0, then the simple definition of P ( A | B ) is undefined . However, it is possible to define a conditional probability with respect to a σ-algebra of such events (such as those arising from a continuous random variable ).  For example, if X and Y are non-degenerate and jointly continuous random variables with density ƒ $_{ X , Y }$ ( x , y ) then, if B has positive measure ,  $$P(X \in A \mid Y \in B) =
 \frac{\int_{y\in B}\int_{x\in A} f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dx\,dy}{\int_{y\in B}\int_{x\in\Omega} f_{X,Y}(x,y)\,dx\,dy} .$$  The case where B has zero measure can only be dealt with directly in the case that B = { y $_{ 0 }$ }, representing a single point, in which case  $$P(X \in A \mid Y = y_0) = \frac{\int_{x\in A} f_{X,Y}(x,y_0)\,dx}{\int_{x\in\Omega} f_{X,Y}(x,y_0)\,dx} .$$  If A has measure zero then the conditional probability is zero. An indication of why the more general case of zero measure cannot be dealt with in a similar way can be seen by noting that the limit, as all δy $_{ i }$ approach zero, of  $$P(X \in A \mid Y \in \cup_i[y_i,y_i+\delta y_i]) \approxeq
 \frac{\sum_{i} \int_{x\in A} f_{X,Y}(x,y_i)\,dx\,\delta y_i}{\sum_{i}\int_{x\in\Omega} f_{X,Y}(x,y_i) \,dx\, \delta y_i} ,$$ depends on their relationship as they approach zero. See conditional expectation for more information.  Conditioning on a random variable  Conditioning on an event may be generalized to conditioning on a random variable. Let X be a random variable; we assume for the sake of presentation that X is discrete, that is, X takes on only finitely many values x . Let A be an event. The conditional probability of A given X is defined as the random variable, written P(A|X) , that takes on the value  $$P(A\mid X=x)$$  whenever  $$X=x.$$  More formally:  $$P(A|X)(\omega)=P(A\mid X=X(\omega)) .$$  The conditional probability P ( A | X ) is a function of X , e.g., if the function g is defined as  $$g(x)= P(A\mid X=x)$$ ,  then  $$P(A|X) =g\circ X$$  Note that P ( A | X ) and X are now both random variables . From the law of total probability , the expected value of P ( A | X ) is equal to the unconditional probability of A .  Example  Suppose that somebody secretly rolls two fair six-sided dice , and we must predict the outcome.   Let A be the value rolled on die 1  Let B be the value rolled on die 2   ''What is the probability that A = 2? ''  Table 1 shows the sample space of 36 outcomes  Clearly, A = 2 in exactly 6 of the 36 outcomes, thus P ( A =2) = ${6}/{36}$ = ${1}/{6}$ .       Table 1  +  B=1  2  3  4  5  6    A=1  2  3  4  5  6  7    2  3  4  5  6  7  8    3  4  5  6  7  8  9    4  5  6  7  8  9  10    5  6  7  8  9  10  11    6  7  8  9  10  11  12       ''Suppose it is revealed that A + B ≤ 5 ''  What is the probability A + B ≤ 5 ?  Table 2 shows that A + B ≤ 5 for exactly 10 of the same 36 outcomes, thus P ( A + B ≤ 5) = ${10}/{36}$       Table 2  +  B=1  2  3  4  5  6    A=1  2  3  4  5  6  7    2  3  4  5  6  7  8    3  4  5  6  7  8  9    4  5  6  7  8  9  10    5  6  7  8  9  10  11      6  7  8  9  10  11  12         ''What is the probability that A = 2 given that  A + B ≤ 5 ? ''  Table 3 shows that for 3 of these 10 outcomes, A = 2  Thus, the conditional probability P ( A =2 | A + B ≤ 5) = ${3}/{10}$ = 0.3.       Table 3  +  B=1  2  3  4  5  6    A=1  2  3  4  5  6  7    2  3  4  5  6  7  8    3  4  5  6  7  8  9    4  5  6  7  8  9  10    5  6  7  8  9  10  11    6  7  8  9  10  11  12       Use in inference  In statistical inference, the conditional probability is an update of the probability of an event based on new information. 5 Incorporating the new information can be done as follows 6   Let A the event of interest be in the sample space , say ( X , P ).  The occurrence of the event A knowing that event B has or will have occurred, means the occurrence of A as it is restricted to B , i.e. $A \cap B$ .  Without the knowledge of the occurrence of B , the information about the occurrence of A would simply be P ( A )  The probability of A knowing that event B has or will have occurred, will be the probability of $A \cap B$ compared with P ( B ), the probability B has occurred.  This results in P ( A | B ) = P ( A  $\cap$  B )/ P ( B ) whenever P ( B )>0 and 0 otherwise.   Note: This approach results in a probability measure that is consistent with the original probability measure and satisfies all the Kolmogorov Axioms . This conditional probability measure also could have resulted by assuming that the relative magnitude of the probability of A with respect to X will be preserved with respect to B (cf. a Formal Derivation below).  Note: The phraseology "evidence" or "information" is generally used in the Bayesian interpretation of probability . The conditioning event is interpreted as evidence for the conditioned event. That is, P ( A ) is the probability of A before accounting for evidence E , and P ( A | E ) is the probability of A after having accounted for evidence E or after having updated P ( A ). This is consistent with the frequentist interpretation, which presumably is the first definition given above.  Statistical independence  Events A and B are defined to be statistically independent if:  $$\begin{align}
              P(A \cap B) &= P(A) P(B) \\
   \Leftrightarrow P(A|B) &= P(A) \\
   \Leftrightarrow P(B|A) &= P(B)
 \end{align}$$  That is, the occurrence of A does not affect the probability of B , and vice versa. Although the derived forms may seem more intuitive, they are not the preferred definition as the conditional probabilities may be undefined if P ( A ) or P ( B ) are 0, and the preferred definition is symmetrical in A and B .  Common fallacies   These fallacies should not be confused with Robert K. Shope's 1978 "conditional fallacy" , which deals with counterfactual examples that beg the question .    Assuming conditional probability is of similar size to its inverse  In general, it cannot be assumed that P ( A | B ) ≈ P ( B | A ). This can be an insidious error, even for those who are highly conversant with statistics. 7 The relationship between P ( A | B ) and P ( B | A ) is given by Bayes' theorem :  $$P(B|A) = \frac{P(A|B) P(B)}{P(A)}.$$  That is, P ( A | B ) ≈ P ( B | A ) only if P ( B )/ P ( A ) ≈ 1, or equivalently, P ( A ) ≈ P ( B ).  Alternatively, noting that A ∩ B = B ∩ A , and applying conditional probability:  $$P(A|B)P(B) = P(A \cap B) = P(B \cap A) = P(B|A)P(A)$$  Rearranging gives the result.  Assuming marginal and conditional probabilities are of similar size  In general, it cannot be assumed that P ( A ) ≈ P ( A | B ). These probabilities are linked through the law of total probability :  $$P(A) = \sum_n P(A \cap B_n) = \sum_n P(A|B_n)P(B_n)$$ .  where the events $(B_n)$ form a countable partition of $A$ .  This fallacy may arise through selection bias . 8 For example, in the context of a medical claim, let S $_{ C }$ be the event that a sequela (chronic disease) S occurs as a consequence of circumstance (acute condition) C . Let H be the event that an individual seeks medical help. Suppose that in most cases, C does not cause S so P ( S $_{ C }$ ) is low. Suppose also that medical attention is only sought if S has occurred due to C . From experience of patients, a doctor may therefore erroneously conclude that P ( S $_{ C }$ ) is high. The actual probability observed by the doctor is P ( S $_{ C }$ | H ).  Over- or under-weighting priors  Not taking prior probability into account partially or completely is called base rate neglect . The reverse, insufficient adjustment from the prior probability is '' conservatism .  Formal derivation  Formally, P ( A | B ) is defined as the probability of A according to a new probability function on the sample space, such that outcomes not in B have probability 0 and that it is consistent with all original probability measures . 9 10  Let Ω be a sample space with elementary events {ω}. Suppose we are told the event B ⊆ Ω has occurred. A new probability distribution (denoted by the conditional notation) is to be assigned on {ω} to reflect this. For events in B , it is reasonable to assume that the relative magnitudes of the probabilities will be preserved. For some constant scale factor α, the new distribution will therefore satisfy:  $$\begin{align}
   &\text{1. }\omega \in B : P(\omega|B) = \alpha P(\omega) \\
   &\text{2. }\omega \notin B : P(\omega|B) = 0 \\
   &\text{3. }\sum_{\omega \in \Omega} {P(\omega|B)} = 1.
 \end{align}$$  Substituting 1 and 2 into 3 to select α:  $$\begin{align}
   \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} {P(\omega | B)} &= \sum_{\omega \in B} {\alpha P(\omega)} + \cancelto{0}{\sum_{\omega \notin B} 0} \\
                                            &= \alpha \sum_{\omega \in B} {P(\omega)} \\
                                            &= \alpha \cdot P(B) \\
                         \Rightarrow \alpha &= \frac{1}{P(B)}
 \end{align}$$  So the new probability distribution is  $$\begin{align}
      \text{1. }\omega \in B&: P(\omega|B) = \frac{P(\omega)}{P(B)} \\
   \text{2. }\omega \notin B&: P(\omega| B) = 0
 \end{align}$$  Now for a general event A ,  $$\begin{align}
   P(A|B) &= \sum_{\omega \in A \cap B} {P(\omega | B)} + \cancelto{0}{\sum_{\omega \in A \cap B^c} P(\omega|B)} \\
          &= \sum_{\omega \in A \cap B} {\frac{P(\omega)}{P(B)}} \\
          &= \frac{P(A \cap B)}{P(B)}
 \end{align}$$  See also   Borel–Kolmogorov paradox  Chain rule (probability)  Class membership probabilities  Conditional probability distribution  Conditioning (probability)  Joint probability distribution  Monty Hall problem  Posterior probability   References  External links    F.
