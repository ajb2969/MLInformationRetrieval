   Witness set      Witness set   In computational learning theory , let C be a concept class over a domain X and c be a concept in C . A subset S of X is a witness set for c in C if c ( S ) verifies c (i.e., c is the only consistent concept with respect to c ( S )). The minimum size of a witness set for c is called the witness size or specification number and is denoted by     w  C    (  c  )        subscript  w  C   c    w_{C}(c)   . The value    max   {     w  C    (  c  )    :   c  âˆˆ  C    }        normal-:     subscript  w  C   c     c  C      \max\{w_{C}(c):c\in C\}   is called the teaching dimension of C .
