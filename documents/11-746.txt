N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol deacetylase

In enzymology, a N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol deacetylase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

6-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol + H2O 
 
 
 
  6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol + acetate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are 6-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol and H2O, whereas its two products are 6-(alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol and acetate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of hydrolases, those acting on carbon-nitrogen bonds other than peptide bonds, specifically in linear amides. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 6-(N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminyl)-1-phosphatidyl-1D-myo-inositol acetylhydrolase. Other names in common use include N-acetyl-D-glucosaminylphosphatidylinositol acetylhydrolase, N-acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol de-N-acetylase, GlcNAc-PI de-N-acetylase, GlcNAc-PI deacetylase, and acetylglucosaminylphosphatidylinositol deacetylase. This enzyme participates in 3 metabolic pathways: glycosylphosphatidylinositol(gpi)-anchor, and glycan structures - biosynthesis 2.
