   F-term      F-term   In theoretical physics , one often analyzes theories with supersymmetry in which F-terms play an important role. In four dimensions, the minimal N=1 supersymmetry may be written using a superspace . This superspace involves four extra fermionic coordinates     θ  1   ,   θ  2   ,    θ  ¯   1   ,    θ  ¯   2       superscript  θ  1    superscript  θ  2    superscript   normal-¯  θ   1    superscript   normal-¯  θ   2     \theta^{1},\theta^{2},\bar{\theta}^{1},\bar{\theta}^{2}   , transforming as a two-component spinor and its conjugate.  Every superfield—i.e. a field that depends on all coordinates of the superspace—may be expanded with respect to the new fermionic coordinates. There exists a special kind of superfields, the so-called chiral superfields , that only depend on the variables   θ   θ   \theta   but not their conjugates. The last term in the corresponding expansion, namely    F   θ  1    θ  2       F   superscript  θ  1    superscript  θ  2     F\theta^{1}\theta^{2}   , is called the F-term . Applying an infinitesimal supersymmetry transformation to a chiral superfield results in yet another chiral superfield whose F-term, in particular, changes by a total derivative. This is significant because then    ∫    d  4    x   F   (  x  )           superscript  d  4   x  F  x     \int{d^{4}x\,F(x)}   is invariant under SUSY transformations as long as boundary terms vanish. Thus F-terms may be used in constructing supersymmetric actions.  Manifestly-supersymmetric Lagrangians may also be written as integrals over the whole superspace. Some special terms, such as the superpotential , may be written as integrals over   θ   θ   \theta   s only. They are also referred to as F-terms, much like the terms in the ordinary potential that arise from these terms of the supersymmetric Lagrangian.
