   Cardiac index      Cardiac index   Cardiac index ( CI ) is a haemodynamic parameter that relates the cardiac output (CO) from left ventricle in one minute to body surface area (BSA), 1 thus relating heart performance to the size of the individual. The unit of measurement is litres per minute per square metre (L/min/m 2 ).  Calculation  The index is usually calculated using the following formula:      CI  =   CO  BSA   =    SV  ×  HR   BSA         CI    CO  BSA            SV  HR   BSA      \text{CI}=\frac{\text{CO}}{\text{BSA}}=\frac{\text{SV}\times\text{HR}}{\text{%
 BSA}}     where   CI : Cardiac index BSA : Body surface area SV : Stroke volume HR : Heart rate CO : Cardiac output   Clinical significance  The normal range of cardiac index in rest is 2.6–4.2 L/min/m 2 .  The cardiac index is frequently measured and used in both intensive care medicine and cardiac intensive care . The CI is a useful marker of how well the heart is functioning as a pump by directly correlating the volume of blood pumped by the heart with an individual's body surface area.  If the CI falls below 2.2 L/min/m 2 , the patient may be in cardiogenic shock .  References  "  Category:Cardiovascular physiology     ↩
