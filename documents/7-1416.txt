William Shanks

William Shanks (25 January 1812 – June 1882)1 was a British amateur mathematician.
Shanks is famous for his calculation of π to 707 places, accomplished in 1873, which, however, was only correct up to the first 527 places.2 This error was highlighted in 1944 by D. F. Ferguson (using a mechanical desk calculator).3
Shanks earned his living by owning a boarding school at Houghton-le-Spring, which left him enough time to spend on his hobby of calculating mathematical constants. His routine was as follows: he would calculate new digits all morning; and then he would spend all afternoon checking his morning's work. To calculate π, Shanks used Machin's formula:



Shanks' approximation was the longest expansion of π until the advent of the electronic digital computer about one century later.
Shanks also calculated e and the Euler–Mascheroni constant γ to many decimal places. He published a table of primes up to 60 000 and found the natural logarithms of 2, 3, 5 and 10 to 137 places.
Shanks died in Houghton-le-Spring, city of Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, England in June 1882, aged 70, and was buried at the local Hillside Cemetery on 17 June 1882.4
