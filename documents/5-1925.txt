   Indirect utility function      Indirect utility function   In economics , a consumer's indirect utility function     v   (  p  ,  w  )       v   p  w     v(p,w)   gives the consumer's maximal attainable utility when faced with a vector   p   p   p   of goods prices and an amount of income    w   w   w   . It reflects both the consumer's preferences and market conditions.  This function is called indirect because consumers usually think about their preferences in terms of what they consume rather than prices. A consumer's indirect utility    v   (  p  ,  w  )       v   p  w     v(p,w)   can be computed from his or her utility function     u   (  x  )    ,      u  x    u(x),   defined over vectors   x   x   x   of quantities of consumable goods, by first computing the most preferred affordable bundle, represented by the vector    x   (  p  ,  w  )       x   p  w     x(p,w)   by solving the utility maximization problem , and second, computing the utility    u   (   x   (  p  ,  w  )    )       u    x   p  w      u(x(p,w))   the consumer derives from that bundle. The resulting indirect utility function is        v   (  p  ,  w  )    =   u   (   x   (  p  ,  w  )    )     .        v   p  w      u    x   p  w       v(p,w)=u(x(p,w)).     The indirect utility function is:   Continuous on R n ++ + R + ;  Decreasing in prices;  Strictly increasing in income;  Homogenous with degree zero in prices and income; if prices and income are all multiplied by a given constant the same bundle of consumption represents a maximum, so optimal utility does not change.  quasi convex in ( p , w );   Moreover, Roy's identity states that if v ( p , w ) is differentiable at    (   p  0   ,   w  0   )      superscript  p  0    superscript  w  0     (p^{0},w^{0})   and       ∂  v    (  p  ,  w  )     ∂  w    ≠  0            v    p  w      w    0    \frac{\partial v(p,w)}{\partial w}\neq 0   , then         -      ∂  v    (   p  0   ,   w  0   )    /   (   ∂   p  i    )       ∂  v    (   p  0   ,   w  0   )    /   ∂  w      =    x  i    (   p  0   ,   w  0   )     ,   i  =   1  ,  …  ,  n     .     formulae-sequence              v     superscript  p  0    superscript  w  0        subscript  p  i           v     superscript  p  0    superscript  w  0       w         subscript  x  i     superscript  p  0    superscript  w  0        i   1  normal-…  n      -\frac{\partial v(p^{0},w^{0})/(\partial p_{i})}{\partial v(p^{0},w^{0})/%
