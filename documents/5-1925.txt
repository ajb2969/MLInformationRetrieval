Indirect utility function

In economics, a consumer's indirect utility function

 
  gives the consumer's maximal attainable utility when faced with a vector 
 
 
 
  of goods prices and an amount of income

 
 . It reflects both the consumer's preferences and market conditions.
This function is called indirect because consumers usually think about their preferences in terms of what they consume rather than prices. A consumer's indirect utility 
 
 
 
 
  can be computed from his or her utility function 
 
 
 
  defined over vectors 
 
 
 
  of quantities of consumable goods, by first computing the most preferred affordable bundle, represented by the vector 
 
 
 
  by solving the utility maximization problem, and second, computing the utility 
 
 
 
  the consumer derives from that bundle. The resulting indirect utility function is



The indirect utility function is:

Continuous on Rn+++ R+;
Decreasing in prices;
Strictly increasing in income;
Homogenous with degree zero in prices and income; if prices and income are all multiplied by a given constant the same bundle of consumption represents a maximum, so optimal utility does not change.
quasi convex in (p,w);

Moreover, Roy's identity states that if v(p,w) is differentiable at 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then
