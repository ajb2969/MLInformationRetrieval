CDP-glycerol glycerophosphotransferase

In enzymology, a CDP-glycerol glycerophosphotransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

CDP-glycerol + (glycerophosphate)n

 
  CMP + (glycerophosphate)n+1


Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are CDP-glycerol and (glycerophosphate)n, whereas its two products are CMP and (glycerophosphate)n+1.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring non-standard substituted phosphate groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is CDP-glycerol:poly(glycerophosphate) glycerophosphotransferase. Other names in common use include teichoic-acid synthase, cytidine diphosphoglycerol glycerophosphotransferase, poly(glycerol phosphate) polymerase, teichoic acid glycerol transferase, glycerophosphate synthetase, and CGPTase.
