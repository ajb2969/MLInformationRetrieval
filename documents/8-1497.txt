   Identric mean      Identric mean   The identric mean of two positive real numbers  x , y is defined as: 1      I   (  x  ,  y  )       I   x  y     \displaystyle I(x,y)     It can be derived from the mean value theorem by considering the secant of the graph of the function    x  ↦   x  ⋅   ln  x       maps-to  x   normal-⋅  x    x      x\mapsto x\cdot\ln x   . It can be generalized to more variables according by the mean value theorem for divided differences . The identric mean is a special case of the Stolarsky mean .
