   Elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda      Elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda   In geometry , the elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda is one of the Johnson solids ( J 42 ). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal orthobirotunda ( J 34 ) by inserting a decagonal prism between its congruent halves. Rotating one of the pentagonal rotundae ( J 6 ) through 36 degrees before inserting the prism yields the elongated pentagonal gyrobirotunda ( J 43 ).  Formulae  The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular , with edge length a : 1     V  =    1  6    (   45  +   17   5    +   15    5  +   2   5        )    a  3    ≈   21.5297...   a  3          V      1  6     45    17    5      15      5    2    5         superscript  a  3           21.5297...   superscript  a  3       V=\frac{1}{6}(45+17\sqrt{5}+15\sqrt{5+2\sqrt{5}})a^{3}\approx 21.5297...a^{3}       A  =  10  +    30   (  10  +  3   5   +    75  +   30   5         )  a    2   ≈  39.306...  a    2      fragments  A   10      fragments  30   fragments  normal-(  10   3    5        75    30    5         normal-)  a   2    39.306...  a   2     A=10+\sqrt{30(10+3\sqrt{5}+\sqrt{75+30\sqrt{5}}})a^{2}\approx 39.306...a^{2}     References  External links     "  Category:Johnson solids     Stephen Wolfram , " Elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda " from Wolfram Alpha .
