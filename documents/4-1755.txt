Elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda

In geometry, the elongated pentagonal orthobirotunda is one of the Johnson solids (J42). As the name suggests, it can be constructed by elongating a pentagonal orthobirotunda (J34) by inserting a decagonal prism between its congruent halves. Rotating one of the pentagonal rotundae (J6) through 36Â degrees before inserting the prism yields the elongated pentagonal gyrobirotunda (J43).
Formulae
The following formulae for volume and surface area can be used if all faces are regular, with edge length a:1
