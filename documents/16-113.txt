2-methylisoborneol synthase

2-methylisoborneol synthase (, sco7700, 2-MIB cyclase, MIB synthase, MIBS) is an enzyme with system name (E)-2-methylgeranyl-diphosphate diphosphate-lyase (cyclizing, 2-methylisoborneol-forming).123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(E)-2-methylgeranyl diphosphate + H2O 
 
 
 
  2-methylisoborneol + diphosphate


The product, 2-methylisoborneol, is a characteristic odiferous compound with a musty smell produced by soil microorganisms.
