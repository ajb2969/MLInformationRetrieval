   Abel's test      Abel's test   In mathematics , Abel's test (also known as Abel's criterion ) is a method of testing for the convergence of an infinite series . The test is named after mathematician Niels Henrik Abel . There are two slightly different versions of Abel's test – one is used with series of real numbers, and the other is used with power series in complex analysis . Abel's uniform convergence test is a criterion for the uniform convergence of a series of functions dependent on parameters .  Abel's test in real analysis  Suppose the following statements are true:       ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   is a convergent series,  { b n } is a monotone sequence, and  { b n } is bounded.   Then    ∑    a  n    b  n           subscript  a  n    subscript  b  n      \sum a_{n}b_{n}   is also convergent.  It is important to understand that this test is mainly pertinent and useful in the context of non absolutely convergent series    ∑   a  n        subscript  a  n     \sum a_{n}   . For absolutely convergent series, this theorem, albeit true, is almost evident.  Abel's test in complex analysis  A closely related convergence test, also known as Abel's test , can often be used to establish the convergence of a power series on the boundary of its circle of convergence . Specifically, Abel's test states that if        lim   n  →  ∞     a  n    =   0         subscript    normal-→  n      subscript  a  n    0    \lim_{n\rightarrow\infty}a_{n}=0\,     and the series       f   (  z  )    =    ∑   n  =  0   ∞     a  n     z  n            f  z     superscript   subscript     n  0         subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n       f(z)=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}a_{n}z^{n}\,     converges when | z |  1, and the coefficients { a n } are positive real numbers decreasing monotonically toward the limit zero for n > m (for large enough n , in other words), then the power series for f ( z ) converges everywhere on the unit circle , except when z = 1. Abel's test cannot be applied when z = 1, so convergence at that single point must be investigated separately. Notice that Abel's test can also be applied to a power series with radius of convergence R ≠ 1 by a simple change of variables ζ = z / R . 1  Proof of Abel's test: Suppose that z is a point on the unit circle, z ≠ 1. Then       z  =    e   i  θ    ⇒       z   1  2    -   z   -   1  2      =   2  i   sin    θ  2      ≠  0      formulae-sequence    z    superscript  e    i  θ    normal-⇒           superscript  z    1  2     superscript  z      1  2        2  i      θ  2          0      z=e^{i\theta}\quad\Rightarrow\quad z^{\frac{1}{2}}-z^{-\frac{1}{2}}=2i\sin{%
 \textstyle\frac{\theta}{2}}\neq 0     so that, for any two positive integers p > q > m , we can write      2  i   sin   θ  2     (    S  p   -   S  q    )       2  i      θ  2       subscript  S  p    subscript  S  q      \displaystyle 2i\sin{\textstyle\frac{\theta}{2}}\left(S_{p}-S_{q}\right)     where S p and S q are partial sums:        S  p   =    ∑   n  =  0   p     a  n    z  n      .       subscript  S  p     superscript   subscript     n  0    p      subscript  a  n    superscript  z  n       S_{p}=\sum_{n=0}^{p}a_{n}z^{n}.\,     But now, since | z | = 1 and the a n are monotonically decreasing positive real numbers when n > m , we can also write      |   2  i   sin   θ  2     (    S  p   -   S  q    )    |        2  i      θ  2       subscript  S  p    subscript  S  q       \displaystyle\left|2i\sin{\textstyle\frac{\theta}{2}}\left(S_{p}-S_{q}\right)\right|     Now we can apply Cauchy's criterion to conclude that the power series for f ( z ) converges at the chosen point z ≠ 1, because sin(½ θ ) ≠ 0 is a fixed quantity, and a q +1 can be made smaller than any given ε > 0 by choosing a large enough q .  Abel's uniform convergence test  Abel's uniform convergence test is a criterion for the uniform convergence of a series of functions or an improper integration of functions dependent on parameters . It is related to Abel's test for the convergence of an ordinary series of real numbers, and the proof relies on the same technique of summation by parts .  The test is as follows. Let { g n } be a uniformly bounded sequence of real-valued continuous functions on a set E such that g n +1 ( x ) ≤ g n ( x ) for all x ∈ E and positive integers n , and let { ƒ n } be a sequence of real-valued functions such that the series Σ ƒ n ( x ) converges uniformly on E . Then Σ ƒ n ( x ) g n ( x ) converges uniformly on E .
