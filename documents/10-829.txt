   RRNA (guanine-N2-)-methyltransferase      RRNA (guanine-N2-)-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a rRNA (guanine-N2-)-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + rRNA   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + rRNA containing N 2 -methylguanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and rRNA , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and rRNA containing N2-methyl guanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:rRNA (guanine-N2-)-methyltransferase . Other names in common use include ribosomal ribonucleate guanine-2-methyltransferase , and S-adenosyl-L-methionine:rRNA (guanine-2-N-)-methyltransferase .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, only one structure has been solved for this class of enzymes, with the PDB accession code .
