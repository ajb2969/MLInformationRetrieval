   Hilbert's theorem (differential geometry)      Hilbert's theorem (differential geometry)   In differential geometry , Hilbert's theorem (1901) states that there exists no complete regular surface    S   S   S   of constant negative gaussian curvature    K   K   K    immersed in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   . This theorem answers the question for the negative case of which surfaces in    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   can be obtained by isometrically immersing complete manifolds with constant curvature .  Hilbert's theorem was first treated by David Hilbert in, "Über Flächen von konstanter Krümmung" ( Trans. Amer. Math. Soc. 2 (1901), 87-99). A different proof was given shortly after by E. Holmgren, "Sur les surfaces à courbure constante négative," (1902).  Proof  The proof of Hilbert's theorem is elaborate and requires several lemmas . The idea is to show the nonexistence of an isometric immersion       φ  =   ψ  ∘   exp  p     :    S  ′   ⟶   ℝ  3       normal-:    φ    ψ   subscript   p      normal-⟶   superscript  S  normal-′    superscript  ℝ  3      \varphi=\psi\circ\exp_{p}:S^{\prime}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}     of a plane    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   to the real space    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   . This proof is basically the same as in Hilbert's paper, although based in the books of Do Carmo and Spivak .  Observations : In order to have a more manageable treatment, but without loss of generality , the curvature may be considered equal to minus one,    K  =   -  1       K    1     K=-1   . There is no loss of generality, since it is being dealt with constant curvatures, and similarities of    ℝ  3     superscript  ℝ  3    \mathbb{R}^{3}   multiply   K   K   K   by a constant. The exponential map      exp  p   :     T  p    (  S  )    ⟶  S      normal-:   subscript   p    normal-⟶     subscript  T  p   S   S     \exp_{p}:T_{p}(S)\longrightarrow S   is a local diffeomorphism (in fact a covering map, by Cartan-Hadamard theorem), therefore, it induces an inner product in the tangent space of   S   S   S   at   p   p   p        T  p    (  S  )        subscript  T  p   S    T_{p}(S)   . Furthermore,    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   denotes the geometric surface     T  p    (  S  )        subscript  T  p   S    T_{p}(S)   with this inner product. If    ψ  :   S  ⟶   ℝ  3       normal-:  ψ   normal-⟶  S   superscript  ℝ  3      \psi:S\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}   is an isometric immersion, the same holds for       φ  =   ψ  ∘   exp  o     :    S  ′   ⟶   ℝ  3       normal-:    φ    ψ   subscript   o      normal-⟶   superscript  S  normal-′    superscript  ℝ  3      \varphi=\psi\circ\exp_{o}:S^{\prime}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}   .  The first lemma is independent from the other ones, and will be used at the end as the counter statement to reject the results from the other lemmas.  Lemma 1 : The area of    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   is infinite.  Proof's Sketch: The idea of the proof is to create a global isometry between   H   H   H   and    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   . Then, since   H   H   H   has an infinite area,    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   will have it too. The fact that the hyperbolic plane    H   H   H   has an infinite area comes by computing the surface integral with the corresponding coefficients of the First fundamental form . To obtain these ones, the hyperbolic plane can be defined as the plane with the following inner product around a point    q  ∈   ℝ  2       q   superscript  ℝ  2     q\in\mathbb{R}^{2}   with coordinates    (  u  ,  v  )     u  v    (u,v)         E  =   ⟨   ∂   ∂  u    ,   ∂   ∂  u    ⟩   =  1    F  =   ⟨   ∂   ∂  u    ,   ∂   ∂  v    ⟩   =   ⟨   ∂   ∂  v    ,   ∂   ∂  u    ⟩   =  0    G  =   ⟨   ∂   ∂  v    ,   ∂   ∂  v    ⟩   =   e  u       formulae-sequence      E        u         u          1        F        u         v                v         u          0        G        v         v           superscript  e  u       E=\left\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial u},\frac{\partial}{\partial u}\right%
 \rangle=1\qquad F=\left\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial u},\frac{\partial}{%
 \partial v}\right\rangle=\left\langle\frac{\partial}{\partial v},\frac{%
 \partial}{\partial u}\right\rangle=0\qquad G=\left\langle\frac{\partial}{%
 \partial v},\frac{\partial}{\partial v}\right\rangle=e^{u}    Since the hyperbolic plane is unbounded, the limits of the integral are infinite , and the area can be calculated through        ∫   -  ∞   ∞     ∫   -  ∞   ∞     e  u   d  u  d  v     =  ∞        superscript   subscript            superscript   subscript             superscript  e  u   d  u  d  v        \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{u}dudv=\infty     Next it is needed to create a map, which will show that the global information from the hyperbolic plane can be transfer to the surface    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   , i.e. a global isometry.    φ  :   H  →   S  ′       normal-:  φ   normal-→  H   superscript  S  normal-′      \varphi:H\rightarrow S^{\prime}   will be the map, whose domain is the hyperbolic plane and image the 2-dimensional manifold     S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   , which carries the inner product from the surface   S   S   S   with negative curvature.   φ   φ   \varphi   will be defined via the exponential map, its inverse, and a linear isometry between their tangent spaces,      ψ  :     T  p    (  H  )    →    T   p  ′     (   S  ′   )        normal-:  ψ   normal-→     subscript  T  p   H      subscript  T   superscript  p  normal-′     superscript  S  normal-′       \psi:T_{p}(H)\rightarrow T_{p^{\prime}}(S^{\prime})   .  That is      φ  =    exp   p  ′    ∘  ψ  ∘   exp  p   -  1         φ     subscript    superscript  p  normal-′    ψ   superscript   subscript   p     1       \varphi=\exp_{p^{\prime}}\circ\psi\circ\exp_{p}^{-1}   ,  where     p  ∈  H   ,    p  ′   ∈   S  ′       formulae-sequence    p  H      superscript  p  normal-′    superscript  S  normal-′      p\in H,p^{\prime}\in S^{\prime}   . That is to say, the starting point    p  ∈  H      p  H    p\in H   goes to the tangent plane from   H   H   H   through the inverse of the exponential map. Then travels from one tangent plane to the other through the isometry   ψ   ψ   \psi   , and then down to the surface    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   with another exponential map.  The following step involves the use of polar coordinates ,    (  ρ  ,  θ  )     ρ  θ    (\rho,\theta)   and    (   ρ  ′   ,   θ  ′   )      superscript  ρ  normal-′    superscript  θ  normal-′     (\rho^{\prime},\theta^{\prime})   , around   p   p   p   and    p  ′     superscript  p  normal-′    p^{\prime}   respectively. The requirement will be that the axis are mapped to each other, that is    θ  =  0      θ  0    \theta=0   goes to     θ  ′   =  0       superscript  θ  normal-′   0    \theta^{\prime}=0   . Then   φ   φ   \varphi   preserves the first fundamental form. In a geodesic polar system, the Gaussian curvature    K   K   K   can be expressed as      K  =   -     (   G   )    ρ  ρ     G         K       subscript    G     ρ  ρ      G       K=-\frac{(\sqrt{G})_{\rho\rho}}{\sqrt{G}}   .  In addition K is constant and fulfills the following differential equation         (   G   )    ρ  ρ    +   K  ⋅   G     =  0         subscript    G     ρ  ρ     normal-⋅  K    G     0    (\sqrt{G})_{\rho\rho}+K\cdot\sqrt{G}=0     Since   H   H   H   and    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   have the same constant Gaussian curvature, then they are locally isometric ( Minding's Theorem ). That means that   φ   φ   \varphi   is a local isometry between   H   H   H   and    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   . Furthermore, from the Hadamard's theorem it follows that   φ   φ   \varphi   is also a covering map. Since    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   is simply connected,   φ   φ   \varphi   is a homeomorphism, and hence, a (global) isometry. Therefore,   H   H   H   and    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   are globally isometric, and because   H   H   H   has an infinite area, then     S  ′   =    T  p    (  S  )         superscript  S  normal-′      subscript  T  p   S     S^{\prime}=T_{p}(S)   has an infinite area, as well.   □   normal-□   \square     Lemma 2 : For each    p  ∈   S  ′       p   superscript  S  normal-′     p\in S^{\prime}   exists a parametrization    x  :  U  ⊂   ℝ  2   ⟶   S  ′   ,  p  ∈  x   (  U  )      fragments  x  normal-:  U    superscript  ℝ  2   normal-⟶   superscript  S  normal-′   normal-,  p   x   fragments  normal-(  U  normal-)     x:U\subset\mathbb{R}^{2}\longrightarrow S^{\prime},\qquad p\in x(U)   , such that the coordinate curves of   x   x   x   are asymptotic curves of     x   (  U  )    =   V  ′         x  U    superscript  V  normal-′     x(U)=V^{\prime}   and form a Tchebyshef net.  Lemma 3 : Let     V  ′   ⊂   S  ′        superscript  V  normal-′    superscript  S  normal-′     V^{\prime}\subset S^{\prime}   be a coordinate neighborhood of    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   such that the coordinate curves are asymptotic curves in    V  ′     superscript  V  normal-′    V^{\prime}   . Then the area A of any quadrilateral formed by the coordinate curves is smaller than    2  π      2  π    2\pi   .  The next goal is to show that   x   x   x   is a parametrization of    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   .  Lemma 4 : For a fixed   t   t   t   , the curve      x   (  s  ,  t  )    ,   -  ∞    <  s  <   +  ∞            x   s  t         s              x(s,t),-\infty   , is an asymptotic curve with   s   s   s   as arc length.  The following 2 lemmas together with lemma 8 will demonstrate the existence of a parametrization     x  :    ℝ  2   ⟶   S  ′       normal-:  x   normal-⟶   superscript  ℝ  2    superscript  S  normal-′      x:\mathbb{R}^{2}\longrightarrow S^{\prime}     Lemma 5    x   x   x   is a local diffeomorphism.  Lemma 6    x   x   x   is surjective .  Lemma 7 : On    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   there are two differentiable linearly independent vector fields which are tangent to the asymptotic curves of    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   .  Lemma 8    x   x   x   is injective .  Proof of Hilbert's Theorem: First, it will be assumed that an isometric immersion from a complete surface with negative curvature   S   S   S   exists    ψ  :   S  ⟶   ℝ  3       normal-:  ψ   normal-⟶  S   superscript  ℝ  3      \psi:S\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}     As stated in the observations, the tangent plane     T  p    (  S  )        subscript  T  p   S    T_{p}(S)   is endowed with the metric induced by the exponential map     exp  p   :     T  p    (  S  )    ⟶  S      normal-:   subscript   p    normal-⟶     subscript  T  p   S   S     \exp_{p}:T_{p}(S)\longrightarrow S   . Moreover,     φ  =   ψ  ∘   exp  p     :    S  ′   ⟶   ℝ  3       normal-:    φ    ψ   subscript   p      normal-⟶   superscript  S  normal-′    superscript  ℝ  3      \varphi=\psi\circ\exp_{p}:S^{\prime}\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{3}   is an isometric immersion and Lemmas 5,6, and 8 show the existence of a parametrization    x  :    ℝ  2   ⟶   S  ′       normal-:  x   normal-⟶   superscript  ℝ  2    superscript  S  normal-′      x:\mathbb{R}^{2}\longrightarrow S^{\prime}   of the whole    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   , such that the coordinate curves of   x   x   x   are the asymptotic curves of    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   . This result was provided by Lemma 4. Therefore,    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   can be covered by a union of "coordinate" quadrilaterals    Q  n     subscript  Q  n    Q_{n}   with     Q  n   ⊂   Q   n  +  1         subscript  Q  n    subscript  Q    n  1      Q_{n}\subset Q_{n+1}   . By Lemma 3, the area of each quadrilateral is smaller than    2  π      2  π    2\pi   . On the other hand, by Lemma 1, the area of    S  ′     superscript  S  normal-′    S^{\prime}   is infinite, therefore has no bounds. This is a contradiction and the proof is concluded.   □   normal-□   \square     See also   Nash embedding theorem , states that every Riemannian manifold can be isometrically embedded into some Euclidean space.
