Littlewood subordination theorem

In mathematics, the Littlewood subordination theorem, proved by J. E. Littlewood in 1925, is a theorem in operator theory and complex analysis. It states that any holomorphic univalent self-mapping of the unit disk in the complex numbers that fixes 0 induces a contractive composition operator on various function spaces of holomorphic functions on the disk. These spaces include the Hardy spaces, the Bergman spaces and Dirichlet space.
Subordination theorem
Let h be a holomorphic univalent mapping of the unit disk D into itself such that h(0) = 0. Then the composition operator Ch defined on holomorphic functions f on D by



defines a linear operator with operator norm less than 1 on the Hardy spaces 
 
 
 
 , the Bergman spaces 
 
 
 
 . (1 â‰¤ p  \mathcal{D}(D).
The norms on these spaces are defined by:









Littlewood's inequalities
Let f be a holomorphic function on the unit disk D and let h be a holomorphic univalent mapping of D into itself with h(0) = 0. Then if 0 \int_0^{2\pi} |f(h(re^{i\theta}))|^p \, d\theta \le \int_0^{2\pi} |f(re^{i\theta})|^p \, d\theta.
This inequality also holds for 0 2 it suffices to show that for f a polynomial1



Let U be the unilateral shift defined by



This has adjoint U* given by



Since f(0) = a0, this gives



and hence



Thus



Since U*f has degree less than f, it follows by induction that



and hence



The same method of proof works for A2 and 
 
 

General Hardy spaces
If f is in Hardy space Hp, then it has a factorization2



with fi an inner function and fo an outer function.
Then



Inequalities
Taking 0  f_r(z)=f(rz).
The inequalities can also be deduced, following , using subharmonic functions.34 The inequaties in turn immediately imply the subordination theorem for general Bergman spaces.
