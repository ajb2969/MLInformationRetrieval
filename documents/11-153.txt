2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase

In enzymology, a 2-hydroxyisoflavanone dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone 
 
 
 
  daidzein + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone, and two products, daidzein and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone hydro-lyase (daidzein-forming). This enzyme is also called 2,7,4'-trihydroxyisoflavanone hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in isoflavonoid biosynthesis.
