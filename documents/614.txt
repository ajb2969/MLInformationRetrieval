   Trigonometric number      Trigonometric number   In mathematics, a trigonometric number 1 is an irrational number produced by taking the sine or cosine of a rational multiple of a circle, or equivalently, the sine or cosine in radians of a rational multiple of π , or the sine or cosine of a rational number of degrees.  Ivan Niven gave proofs of theorems regarding these numbers. 2 3 Li Zhou and Lubomir Markov 4 recently improved and simplified Niven's proofs.  Any trigonometric number can be expressed in terms of radicals . 5 For example,        cos   (   π  /  23   )    =   -    (   1  /  2   )     (   -  1   )    22  /  23     (   1  +    (   -  1   )    2  /  23     )      .          π  23          1  2    superscript    1     22  23      1   superscript    1     2  23         \cos(\pi/23)=-(1/2)(-1)^{22/23}(1+(-1)^{2/23}).     Thus every trigonometric number is an algebraic number . This latter statement can be proved 6 by starting with the statement of de Moivre's formula for the case of    θ  =    2  π  k   /  n       θ      2  π  k   n     \theta=2\pi k/n   for coprime  k and n :        (    cos  θ   +   i   sin  θ     )   n   =  1.       superscript      θ     i    θ     n   1.    (\cos\theta+i\sin\theta)^{n}=1.     Expanding the left side and equating real parts gives an equation in    cos  θ      θ    \cos\theta   and      sin  2   θ   ;      superscript   2   θ    \sin^{2}\theta;   substituting      sin  2   θ   =   1  -    cos  2   θ          superscript   2   θ     1    superscript   2   θ      \sin^{2}\theta=1-\cos^{2}\theta   gives a polynomial equation having    cos  θ      θ    \cos\theta   as a solution, so by definition the latter is an algebraic number. Also    sin  θ      θ    \sin\theta   is algebraic since it equals the algebraic number     cos   (   θ  -   π  /  2    )    .        θ    π  2      \cos(\theta-\pi/2).   Finally,     tan  θ   ,      θ    \tan\theta,   where again   θ   θ   \theta   is a rational multiple of    π  ,    π   \pi,   is algebraic as can be seen by equating the imaginary parts of the expansion of the de Moivre equation and dividing through by     cos  n   θ      superscript   n   θ    \cos^{n}\theta   to obtain a polynomial equation in     tan  θ   .      θ    \tan\theta.
