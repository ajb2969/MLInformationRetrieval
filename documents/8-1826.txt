   Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook operator      Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook operator   The Bhatnagar–Gross–Krook operator (abbreviated BGK operator ) term refers to a collision operator used in the Boltzmann Equation and in the Lattice Boltzmann method , a Computational fluid dynamics technique. It is given by the following formula:       Ω  i   =   -    τ   -  1     (    n  i   -   n  i   E  Q     )          subscript  normal-Ω  i        superscript  τ    1       subscript  n  i    superscript   subscript  n  i     E  Q         \Omega_{i}=-\tau^{-1}(n_{i}-n_{i}^{EQ})     where    n  i   E  Q      superscript   subscript  n  i     E  Q     n_{i}^{EQ}   is a local equilibrium value for the population of particles in the direction of link    𝐞  i     subscript  𝐞  i    \mathbf{e}_{i}   The term   τ   τ   \tau   is a relaxation time, and related to the viscosity.  The operator is named after Prabhu L. Bhatnagar , Eugene P. Gross , and Max Krook , the three scientists who introduced it in a paper in Physical Review in 1954. 1  References     "  Category:Statistical mechanics  Category:Computational fluid dynamics     ↩
