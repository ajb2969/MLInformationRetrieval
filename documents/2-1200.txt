   Wilson's theorem      Wilson's theorem   In number theory , Wilson's theorem states that a natural number n > 1 is a prime number  if and only if        (   n  -  1   )   !   ≡    -  1      (   mod  n   )            n  1     annotated    1    pmod  n      (n-1)!\ \equiv\ -1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}n)   .  That is, it asserts that the factorial       (   n  -  1   )   !   =   1  ×  2  ×  3  ×  ⋯  ×   (   n  -  1   )            n  1      1  2  3  normal-⋯    n  1      (n-1)!=1\times 2\times 3\times\cdots\times(n-1)   is one less than a multiple of n exactly when n is a prime number.  History  This theorem was stated by Ibn al-Haytham (c. 1000 AD), 1 and John Wilson . 2  Edward Waring announced the theorem in 1770, although neither he nor his student Wilson could prove it. Lagrange gave the first proof in 1771. 3 There is evidence that Leibniz was also aware of the result a century earlier, but he never published it. Giovanni Vacca (1899) "Sui manoscritti inediti di Leibniz" (On unpublished manuscripts of Leibniz), Bollettino di bibliografia e storia delle scienze matematiche ... (Bulletin of the bibliography and history of mathematics), vol. 2, pages 113–116; see [ http://books.google.com/books?id=vqwSAQAAMAAJ&pg; ;=PA114#v=onepage&q;&f;=false page 114] (in Italian). Vacca quotes from Leibniz's mathematical manuscripts kept at the Royal Public Library in Hanover (Germany), vol. 3 B, bundle 11, page 10:   Original : Inoltre egli intravide anche il teorema di Wilson, come risulta dall'enunciato seguente:  "Productus continuorum usque ad numerum qui antepraecedit datum divisus per datum relinquit 1 (vel complementum ad unum?) si datus sit primitivus. Si datus sit derivativus relinquet numerum qui cum dato habeat communem mensuram unitate majorem."  Egli non giunse pero a dimostrarlo.    Translation : In addition, he [Leibniz] also glimpsed Wilson's theorem, as shown in the following statement:  "The product of all integers preceding the given integer, when divided by the given integer, leaves 1 (or the complement of 1?) if the given integer be prime. If the given integer be composite, it leaves a number which has a common factor with the given integer [which is] greater than one."  However, he didn't succeed in proving it.

Lagrange's theorem , which states that in any field a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots, is needed for both proofs.  Composite modulus  If n is composite it is divisible by some prime number q , where . If  were congruent to  then it would also be congruent to −1 (mod q ). But ( n − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod q ).  In fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3! = 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4), if n is composite then ( n − 1)! is congruent to 0 (mod n ). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if n can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, , where 2 ≤ a 2. But then 2 q 2 = n , both q and 2 q will be factors of ( n − 1)!, and again n divides ( n − 1)!.  Prime modulus   Elementary proof   The result is trivial when , so assume p is an odd prime, . Since the residue classes (mod p ) are a field, every non-zero a has a unique multiplicative inverse, a −1 . Lagrange's theorem implies that the only values of a for which are  (because the congruence can have at most two roots (mod p )). Therefore, with the exception of ±1, the factors of  can be arranged in unequal pairs, 5 where the product of each pair is . This proves Wilson's theorem.  For example, if ,        10  !   =    [   (   1  ⋅  10   )   ]   ⋅   [    (   2  ⋅  6   )    (   3  ⋅  4   )    (   5  ⋅  9   )    (   7  ⋅  8   )    ]    ≡    [   -  1   ]   ⋅   [   1  ⋅  1  ⋅  1  ⋅  1   ]    ≡    -  1      (   mod  11   )     .          10    normal-⋅   delimited-[]   normal-⋅  1  10     delimited-[]     normal-⋅  2  6    normal-⋅  3  4    normal-⋅  5  9    normal-⋅  7  8            normal-⋅   delimited-[]    1     delimited-[]   normal-⋅  1  1  1  1           annotated    1    pmod  11       10!=[(1\cdot 10)]\cdot[(2\cdot 6)(3\cdot 4)(5\cdot 9)(7\cdot 8)]\equiv[-1]%
 \cdot[1\cdot 1\cdot 1\cdot 1]\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}11).\,      Proof using Fermat's little theorem   Again, the result is trivial for p = 2, so suppose p is an odd prime, . Consider the polynomial        g   (  x  )    =    (   x  -  1   )    (   x  -  2   )   ⋯   (   x  -   (   p  -  1   )    )     .        g  x       x  1     x  2   normal-⋯    x    p  1       g(x)=(x-1)(x-2)\cdots(x-(p-1)).\,     g has degree , leading term , and constant term . Its  roots are 1, 2, ..., .  Now consider       h   (  x  )    =    x   p  -  1    -   1.          h  x      superscript  x    p  1    1.     h(x)=x^{p-1}-1.\,     h also has degree  and leading term . Modulo p , Fermat's little theorem says it also has the same  roots, 1, 2, ..., .  Finally, consider        f   (  x  )    =    g   (  x  )    -   h   (  x  )      .        f  x       g  x     h  x      f(x)=g(x)-h(x).\,     f has degree at most p − 2 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo p also has the  roots 1, 2, ..., . But Lagrange's theorem says it cannot have more than p − 2 roots. Therefore f must be identically zero (mod p ), so its constant term . This is Wilson's theorem.   Proof using the Sylow theorems   It is possible to deduce Wilson's theorem from a particular application of the Sylow theorems . Let p be a prime. It is immediate to deduce that the symmetric group     S  p     subscript  S  p    S_{p}   has exactly     (   p  -  1   )   !        p  1     (p-1)!   elements of order p , namely the p -cycles    C  p     subscript  C  p    C_{p}   . On the other hand, each Sylow p -subgroup in    S  p     subscript  S  p    S_{p}   is a copy of    C  p     subscript  C  p    C_{p}   . Hence it follows that the number of Sylow p -subgroups is     n  p   =    (   p  -  2   )   !        subscript  n  p       p  2      n_{p}=(p-2)!   . The Sylow theorems imply         (   p  -  2   )   !   ≡   1     (   mod  p   )     .          p  2     annotated  1   pmod  p      (p-2)!\equiv 1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).   Multiplying both sides by ( p - 1) gives         (   p  -  1   )   !   ≡   p  -  1   ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )     ,            p  1      p  1         annotated    1    pmod  p       (p-1)!\equiv p-1\equiv-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p),   that is, the result.  Applications  Primality tests  In practice, Wilson's theorem is useless as a primality test because computing ( n − 1)! modulo n for large n is computationally complex , and much faster primality tests are known (indeed, even trial division is considerably more efficient).  Quadratic residues  Using Wilson's Theorem, for any odd prime , we can rearrange the left hand side of        1  ⋅  2   ⋯   (   p  -  1   )    ≡    -   1       (   mod  p   )           normal-⋅  1  2   normal-⋯    p  1     annotated    1    pmod  p      1\cdot 2\cdots(p-1)\ \equiv\ -1\ \;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     to obtain the equality          1  ⋅   (   p  -  1   )   ⋅  2  ⋅   (   p  -  2   )    ⋯  m   ⋅   (   p  -  m   )    ≡     1  ⋅   (   -  1   )   ⋅  2  ⋅   (   -  2   )    ⋯  m   ⋅   (   -  m   )    ≡    -  1      (   mod  p   )     .         normal-⋅     normal-⋅  1    p  1   2    p  2    normal-⋯  m     p  m     normal-⋅     normal-⋅  1    1   2    2    normal-⋯  m     m          annotated    1    pmod  p       1\cdot(p-1)\cdot 2\cdot(p-2)\cdots m\cdot(p-m)\ \equiv\ 1\cdot(-1)\cdot 2\cdot%
 (-2)\cdots m\cdot(-m)\ \equiv\ -1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     This becomes         ∏   j  =  1   m      j  2     ≡     (   -  1   )    m  +  1       (   mod  p   )          superscript   subscript  product    j  1    m    superscript  j  2     annotated   superscript    1     m  1     pmod  p      \prod_{j=1}^{m}\ j^{2}\ \equiv(-1)^{m+1}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p)     or         (   m  !   )   2   ≡     (   -  1   )    m  +  1       (   mod  p   )     .       superscript    m   2    annotated   superscript    1     m  1     pmod  p      (m!)^{2}\equiv(-1)^{m+1}\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}p).     We can use this fact to prove part of a famous result: for any prime p such that p ≡ 1 (mod 4) , the number (−1) is a square ( quadratic residue ) mod p . For suppose p = 4 k + 1 for some integer k . Then we can take m = 2 k above, and we conclude that ( m !) 2 is congruent to (−1).  Formulas for primes  Wilson's theorem has been used to construct formulas for primes , but they are too slow to have practical value.  p-adic gamma function  Wilson's theorem allows to define the p-adic gamma function .  Gauss's generalization  Gauss proved 6 that if m > 2         ∏       k  =  1         gcd   (  k  ,  m  )    =  1       m     k    ≡   {       -  1      (   mod  m   )        if  m   =   4  ,   p  α   ,   2   p  α           1     (   mod  m   )      otherwise            superscript   subscript  product   STACKED    k  1       k  m   1     m   k    cases   annotated    1    pmod  m        if  m    4   superscript  p  α     2   superscript  p  α       annotated  1   pmod  m    otherwise     \prod_{k=1\atop\gcd(k,m)=1}^{m}\!\!k\ \equiv\begin{cases}-1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm
 mod%
 }}m)&\text{if }m=4,\;p^{\alpha},\;2p^{\alpha}\\
 \;\;\,1\;\;(\mathop{{\rm mod}}m)&\text{otherwise}\end{cases}     where p is an odd prime, and   α   α   \alpha   is a positive integer. The values of m for which the product is −1 are precisely the ones where there is a primitive root modulo m . 7  This further generalizes to the fact that in any finite abelian group , either the product of all elements is the identity, or there is precisely one element a of order 2 (but not both). In the latter case, the product of all elements equals a .
