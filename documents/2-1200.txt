Wilson's theorem

In number theory, Wilson's theorem states that a natural number n > 1 is a prime number if and only if


 
 .
That is, it asserts that the factorial

 
  is one less than a multiple of n exactly when n is a prime number.
History
This theorem was stated by Ibn al-Haytham (c. 1000 AD),1 and John Wilson.2 Edward Waring announced the theorem in 1770, although neither he nor his student Wilson could prove it. Lagrange gave the first proof in 1771.3 There is evidence that Leibniz was also aware of the result a century earlier, but he never published it.Giovanni Vacca (1899) "Sui manoscritti inediti di Leibniz" (On unpublished manuscripts of Leibniz), Bollettino di bibliografia e storia delle scienze matematiche ... (Bulletin of the bibliography and history of mathematics), vol. 2, pages 113–116; see [http://books.google.com/books?id=vqwSAQAAMAAJ&pg;;=PA114#v=onepage&q;&f;=false page 114] (in Italian). Vacca quotes from Leibniz's mathematical manuscripts kept at the Royal Public Library in Hanover (Germany), vol. 3 B, bundle 11, page 10:

Original : Inoltre egli intravide anche il teorema di Wilson, come risulta dall'enunciato seguente:

 "Productus continuorum usque ad numerum qui antepraecedit datum divisus per datum relinquit 1 (vel complementum ad unum?) si datus sit primitivus. Si datus sit derivativus relinquet numerum qui cum dato habeat communem mensuram unitate majorem."

 Egli non giunse pero a dimostrarlo.


Translation : In addition, he [Leibniz] also glimpsed Wilson's theorem, as shown in the following statement:

 "The product of all integers preceding the given integer, when divided by the given integer, leaves 1 (or the complement of 1?) if the given integer be prime. If the given integer be composite, it leaves a number which has a common factor with the given integer [which is] greater than one."

 However, he didn't succeed in proving it.

Example
The following table shows the values of n from 2 to 30, (n − 1)!, and the remainder when (n − 1)! is divided by n. (In the notation of modular arithmetic, the remainder when m is divided by n is written m mod n.) The background color is blue for prime values of n, gold for composite values.

Proofs
Both of the proofs (for prime moduli)4 below make use of the fact that the residue classes modulo a prime number are a field—see the article prime field for more details. Lagrange's theorem, which states that in any field a polynomial of degree n has at most n roots, is needed for both proofs.
Composite modulus
If n is composite it is divisible by some prime number q, where . If  were congruent to  then it would also be congruent to −1 (mod q). But (n − 1)! ≡ 0 (mod q).
In fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3! = 6 ≡ 2 (mod 4), if n is composite then (n − 1)! is congruent to 0 (mod n). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if n can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, , where 2 ≤ a  2. But then 2q 2 = n, both q and 2q will be factors of (n − 1)!, and again n divides (n − 1)!.
Prime modulus

Elementary proof

The result is trivial when , so assume p is an odd prime, . Since the residue classes (mod p) are a field, every non-zero a has a unique multiplicative inverse, a−1. Lagrange's theorem implies that the only values of a for which  are  (because the congruence  can have at most two roots (mod p)). Therefore, with the exception of ±1, the factors of  can be arranged in unequal pairs,5 where the product of each pair is . This proves Wilson's theorem.
For example, if ,




Proof using Fermat's little theorem

Again, the result is trivial for p = 2, so suppose p is an odd prime, . Consider the polynomial



g has degree , leading term , and constant term . Its  roots are 1, 2, ..., .
Now consider



h also has degree  and leading term . Modulo p, Fermat's little theorem says it also has the same  roots, 1, 2, ..., .
Finally, consider



f has degree at most p − 2 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo p also has the  roots 1, 2, ..., . But Lagrange's theorem says it cannot have more than p − 2 roots. Therefore f must be identically zero (mod p), so its constant term . This is Wilson's theorem.

Proof using the Sylow theorems

It is possible to deduce Wilson's theorem from a particular application of the Sylow theorems. Let p be a prime. It is immediate to deduce that the symmetric group

 
  has exactly 
 
 
 
  elements of order p, namely the p-cycles 
 
 
 
 . On the other hand, each Sylow p-subgroup in 
 
 
 
  is a copy of 
 
 
 
 . Hence it follows that the number of Sylow p-subgroups is 
 
 
 
 . The Sylow theorems imply


 
  Multiplying both sides by (p - 1) gives


 
  that is, the result.
Applications
Primality tests
In practice, Wilson's theorem is useless as a primality test because computing (n − 1)! modulo n for large n is computationally complex, and much faster primality tests are known (indeed, even trial division is considerably more efficient).
Quadratic residues
Using Wilson's Theorem, for any odd prime , we can rearrange the left hand side of



to obtain the equality



This becomes



or



We can use this fact to prove part of a famous result: for any prime p such that p ≡ 1 (mod 4), the number (−1) is a square (quadratic residue) mod p. For suppose p = 4k + 1 for some integer k. Then we can take m = 2k above, and we conclude that (m!)2 is congruent to (−1).
Formulas for primes
Wilson's theorem has been used to construct formulas for primes, but they are too slow to have practical value.
p-adic gamma function
Wilson's theorem allows to define the p-adic gamma function.
Gauss's generalization
Gauss proved6 that if m > 2



where p is an odd prime, and 
 
 
 
  is a positive integer. The values of m for which the product is −1 are precisely the ones where there is a primitive root modulo m.7
This further generalizes to the fact that in any finite abelian group, either the product of all elements is the identity, or there is precisely one element a of order 2 (but not both). In the latter case, the product of all elements equals a.
