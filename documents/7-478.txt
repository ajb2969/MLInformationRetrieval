A van der Corput sequence is an example of the simplest one-dimensional low-discrepancy sequence over the unit interval; it was first described in 1935 by the Dutch mathematician J. G. van der Corput. It is constructed by reversing the base n representation of the sequence of natural numbers (1, 2, 3, …).
The b-ary representation of the positive integer n (≥ 1) is



where b is the base of in which number n is represented, and 0 ≤ dk(n)  g_b(n)=\sum_{k=0}^{L-1}d_k(n)b^{-k-1}. 
Examples
For example, the decimal van der Corput sequence begins

0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9, 0.01, 0.11, 0.21, 0.31, 0.41, 0.51, 0.61, 0.71, 0.81, 0.91, 0.02, 0.12, 0.22, 0.32, …,
 

whereas the binary van der Corput sequence is

0.12, 0.012, 0.112, 0.0012, 0.1012, 0.0112, 0.1112, 0.00012, 0.10012, 0.01012, 0.11012, 0.00112, 0.10112, 0.01112, 0.11112, …
 

or, equivalently,



The elements of the van der Corput sequence (in any base) form a dense set in the unit interval; that is, for any real number in [0, 1], there exists a subsequence of the van der Corput sequence that converges to that number. They are also equidistributed over the unit interval.
