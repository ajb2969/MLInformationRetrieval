   Pitchfork bifurcation      Pitchfork bifurcation   In bifurcation theory , a field within mathematics , a pitchfork bifurcation is a particular type of local bifurcation. Pitchfork bifurcations, like Hopf bifurcations have two types - supercritical or subcritical.  In continuous dynamical systems described by ODEs —i.e. flows—pitchfork bifurcations occur generically in systems with symmetry .  Supercritical case  The normal form of the supercritical pitchfork bifurcation is  $$\frac{dx}{dt}=rx-x^3.$$ For negative values of $r$ , there is one stable equilibrium at $x = 0$ . For $r>0$ there is an unstable equilibrium at $x = 0$ , and two stable equilibria at $x = \pm\sqrt{r}$ .  Subcritical case  The normal form for the subcritical case is  $$\frac{dx}{dt}=rx+x^3.$$ In this case, for $r<0$ the equilibrium at $x=0$ is stable, and there are two unstable equilbria at $x = \pm \sqrt{-r}$ . For $r>0$ the equilibrium at $x=0$ is unstable.  Formal definition  An ODE  $$\dot{x}=f(x,r)\,$$ described by a one parameter function $f(x, r)$ with $r \in \Bbb{R}$ satisfying:  $$-f(x, r) = f(-x, r)\,\,$$ (f is an odd function ),  $$\begin{array}{lll}
 \displaystyle\frac{\part f}{\part x}(0, r_{o}) = 0 , &
 \displaystyle\frac{\part^2 f}{\part x^2}(0, r_{o}) = 0, &
 \displaystyle\frac{\part^3 f}{\part x^3}(0, r_{o}) \neq 0,
 \\[12pt]
 \displaystyle\frac{\part f}{\part r}(0, r_{o}) = 0, &
 \displaystyle\frac{\part^2 f}{\part r \part x}(0, r_{o}) \neq 0.
 \end{array}$$  has a pitchfork bifurcation at $(x, r) = (0, r_{o})$ . The form of the pitchfork is given by the sign of the third derivative:  $$\frac{\part^3 f}{\part x^3}(0, r_{o})
