   Curvature form      Curvature form   In differential geometry , the curvature form describes curvature of a connection on a principal bundle . It can be considered as an alternative to or generalization of the curvature tensor in Riemannian geometry .  Definition  Let G be a Lie group with Lie algebra    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   , and P → B be a principal G -bundle . Let ω be an Ehresmann connection on P (which is a    𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -valued  one-form on P ).  Then the curvature form is the   𝔤   𝔤   \mathfrak{g}   -valued 2-form on P defined by       Ω  =    d  ω   +    1  2    [   ω  ∧  ω   ]     =   D  ω    .        normal-Ω      d  ω       1  2    delimited-[]    ω  ω             D  ω      \Omega=d\omega+{1\over 2}[\omega\wedge\omega]=D\omega.     Here   d   d   d   stands for exterior derivative ,    [  ⋅  ∧  ⋅  ]     fragments  normal-[  normal-⋅   normal-⋅  normal-]    [\cdot\wedge\cdot]   is defined in the article " Lie algebra-valued form " and D denotes the exterior covariant derivative . In other terms,        Ω    (  X  ,  Y  )    =    d  ω   (  X  ,  Y  )    +    1  2    [   ω   (  X  )    ,   ω   (  Y  )    ]           normal-Ω   X  Y        d  ω   X  Y        1  2      ω  X     ω  Y        \,\Omega(X,Y)=d\omega(X,Y)+{1\over 2}[\omega(X),\omega(Y)]   where X , Y are tangent vectors to P .  There is also another expression for Ω:       2  Ω   (  X  ,  Y  )    =    -   [   h  X   ,   h  Y   ]    +   h   [  X  ,  Y  ]           2  normal-Ω   X  Y           h  X     h  Y       h   X  Y       2\Omega(X,Y)=-[hX,hY]+h[X,Y]   where hZ means the horizontal component of Z and on the right we identified a vertical vector field and a Lie algebra element generating it ( fundamental vector field ). 1  A connection is said to be flat if its curvature vanishes: Ω = 0. Equivalently, a connection is flat if the structure group can be reduced to the same underlying group but with the discrete topology. See also: flat vector bundle .  Curvature form in a vector bundle  If E → B is a vector bundle, then one can also think of ω as a matrix of 1-forms and the above formula becomes the structure equation of E. Cartan:        Ω   =     d  ω   +  ω   ∧  ω    ,      normal-Ω        d  ω   ω   ω     \,\Omega=d\omega+\omega\wedge\omega,     where   ∧     \wedge   is the wedge product . More precisely, if    ω   j   i     subscript   superscript  ω  i   j    \omega^{i}_{\ j}   and    Ω   j   i     subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  i   j    \Omega^{i}_{\ j}   denote components of ω and Ω correspondingly, (so each    ω   j   i     subscript   superscript  ω  i   j    \omega^{i}_{\ j}   is a usual 1-form and each    Ω   j   i     subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  i   j    \Omega^{i}_{\ j}   is a usual 2-form) then        Ω   j   i   =     d   ω   j   i    +    ∑  k    ω   k   i     ∧   ω   j   k     .       subscript   superscript  normal-Ω  i   j         d   subscript   superscript  ω  i   j      subscript   k    subscript   superscript  ω  i   k      subscript   superscript  ω  k   j      \Omega^{i}_{\ j}=d\omega^{i}_{\ j}+\sum_{k}\omega^{i}_{\ k}\wedge\omega^{k}_{%
 \ j}.     For example, for the tangent bundle of a Riemannian manifold , the structure group is O( n ) and Ω is a 2-form with values in the Lie algebra of O( n ), i.e. the antisymmetric matrices . In this case the form Ω is an alternative description of the curvature tensor , i.e.         R    (  X  ,  Y  )    =   Ω   (  X  ,  Y  )     ,        R   X  Y      normal-Ω   X  Y      \,R(X,Y)=\Omega(X,Y),     using the standard notation for the Riemannian curvature tensor.  Bianchi identities  If   θ   θ   \theta   is the canonical vector-valued 1-form on the frame bundle, the torsion    Θ   normal-Θ   \Theta   of the connection form    ω   ω   \omega   is the vector-valued 2-form defined by the structure equation       Θ  =     d  θ   +  ω   ∧  θ   =   D  θ    ,        normal-Θ        d  θ   ω   θ          D  θ      \Theta=d\theta+\omega\wedge\theta=D\theta,     where as above D denotes the exterior covariant derivative .  The first Bianchi identity takes the form        D  Θ   =   Ω  ∧  θ    .        D  normal-Θ     normal-Ω  θ     D\Theta=\Omega\wedge\theta.     The second Bianchi identity takes the form        D   Ω   =  0        D  normal-Ω   0    \,D\Omega=0     and is valid more generally for any connection in a principal bundle .

Then we can assume X , Y are both horizontal (otherwise both sides vanish since Ω is horizontal). In that case, this is a consequence of the invariant formula for exterior derivative d and the fact ω(Z) is a unique Lie algebra element that generates the vector field Z . ↩
