<h2 id="role-in-fatty-acid-catabolism">Role in Fatty Acid Catabolism</h2>

<p>Methylmalonyl CoA epimerase plays an important role in the catabolism of <a href="Fatty_Acid" title="wikilink">fatty acids</a> with odd-length carbon chains. In the catabolism of even-chain <a href="Saturation_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">saturated</a> fatty acids, the <a href="Beta_oxidation" title="wikilink">β-oxidation pathway</a> breaks down fatty acyl-CoA molecules in repeated sequences of four reactions to yield one <a href="acetyl_CoA" title="wikilink">acetyl CoA</a> per repeated sequence. This means that, for each round of β-oxidation, the fatty acyl-Co-A is shortened by two carbons. If the fatty acid began with an even number of carbons, this process could break down an entire saturated fatty acid into acetyl-CoA units. If the fatty acid began with an odd number of carbons, however, β-oxidation would break the fatty acyl-CoA down until the three carbon propionyl-CoA is formed. In order to convert this to the metabolically useful <a class="uri" href="succinyl-CoA" title="wikilink">succinyl-CoA</a>, three reactions are needed. The propionyl-CoA is first carboxylated to (<em>S</em>)-methylmalonyl-CoA by the enzyme <a href="Propionyl-CoA_carboxylase" title="wikilink">Propionyl-CoA carboxylase</a>. Methylmalonyl CoA epimerase then catalyzes the rearrangement of (<em>S</em>)-methylmalonyl-CoA to the (<em>R</em>) form in a reaction that uses a <a href="vitamin_B12" title="wikilink">vitamin B12</a> <a href="cofactor_(biochemistry)" title="wikilink">cofactor</a> and a resonance-stabilized <a class="uri" href="carbanion" title="wikilink">carbanion</a> <a href="Reactive_intermediate" title="wikilink">intermediate</a>. The (<em>R</em>)-methylmalonyl-CoA is then converted to succinyl-CoA in a reaction catalyzed by <a href="methylmalonyl-CoA_mutase" title="wikilink">methylmalonyl-CoA mutase</a>.</p>
<h2 id="reaction-mechanism">Reaction Mechanism</h2>

<p>Acting as a <a href="Enzyme_catalysis" title="wikilink">general base</a>, the enzyme abstracts a proton from the β-carbon of (<em>R</em>)-methylmalonyl-CoA. This results in the formation of a carbanion intermediate in which the α-carbon is stabilized by resonance. The enzyme then acts as a general acid to protonate the β-carbon, resulting in the formation of (<em>S</em>)-methylmalonyl-CoA.</p>
