<h1>Birefringence</h1>
<hr/>

<p> </p>

<p><strong>Birefringence</strong> is the <a href="optics" title="wikilink">optical</a> property of a material having a <a href="refractive_index" title="wikilink">refractive index</a> that depends on the <a href="Polarization_(waves)" title="wikilink">polarization</a> and propagation direction of <a class="uri" href="light" title="wikilink">light</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> These optically <a class="uri" href="anisotropic" title="wikilink">anisotropic</a> materials are said to be <strong>birefringent</strong> (or <strong>birefractive</strong>). The birefringence is often quantified as the maximum difference between refractive indices exhibited by the material. <a href="Crystal" title="wikilink">Crystals</a> with asymmetric <a href="crystal_structure" title="wikilink">crystal structures</a> are often birefringent, as are <a href="plastic" title="wikilink">plastics</a> under <a href="mechanical_stress" title="wikilink">mechanical stress</a>.</p>

<p>Birefringence is responsible for the phenomenon of <strong>double refraction</strong> whereby a <a href="Ray_(optics)" title="wikilink">ray</a> of light, when incident upon a birefringent material, is split by polarization into two rays taking slightly different paths. This effect was first described by the <a href="Denmark" title="wikilink">Danish</a> scientist <a href="Rasmus_Bartholin" title="wikilink">Rasmus Bartholin</a> in 1669, who observed it<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> in <a class="uri" href="calcite" title="wikilink">calcite</a>, a crystal having one of the strongest birefringences. However it was not until the 19th century that <a href="Augustin-Jean_Fresnel" title="wikilink">Augustin-Jean Fresnel</a> described the phenomenon in terms of polarization, understanding light as a wave with field components in transverse polarizations (perpendicular to the direction of the wave vector).</p>
<h2 id="explanation">Explanation</h2>

<p>The simplest (and most common) type of birefringence is described as <em>uniaxial</em>, meaning that there is a single direction governing the optical anisotropy whereas all directions perpendicular to it (or at a given angle to it) are optically equivalent. Thus rotating the material around this axis does not change its optical behavior. This special direction is known as the <a href="Optic_axis_of_a_crystal" title="wikilink">optic axis</a> of the material. Light whose polarization is <em>perpendicular</em> to the optic axis is governed by a refractive index <em>n</em><sub>o</sub> (for "ordinary"). Light whose polarization is <em>in the direction of</em> the optic axis sees an optical index <em>n</em><sub>e</sub> (for "extraordinary"). For any ray direction there will be a polarization direction perpendicular to the optic axis, and this is called an <em>ordinary ray</em>. However, for most ray directions the other polarization direction will be partly in the direction of the optic axis, and this is called an <em>extraordinary ray</em>. The ordinary ray will always experience a refractive index of <em>n</em><sub>o</sub>, whereas the refractive index of the extraordinary ray will be in between <em>n</em><sub>o</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>e</sub>, depending on the ray direction as described by the <a href="index_ellipsoid" title="wikilink">index ellipsoid</a>. The magnitude of the difference is quantified by the birefringence:</p>

<p>The propagation (as well as <a href="Fresnel_equations" title="wikilink">reflection coefficient</a>) of the ordinary ray is simply described by <em>n</em><sub>o</sub> as if there were no birefringence involved. However the extraordinary ray, as its name suggests, propagates unlike any wave in a homogenous optical material. Its refraction (and reflection) at a surface can be understood using the effective refractive index (a value in between <em>n</em><sub>o</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>e</sub>). However it is in fact an <a href="inhomogeneous_wave" title="wikilink">inhomogeneous wave</a> whose power flow (given by the <a href="Poynting_vector" title="wikilink">Poynting vector</a>) is not exactly in the direction of the <a href="wave_vector" title="wikilink">wave vector</a>. This causes an additional shift in that beam, even when launched at normal incidence, as is popularly observed using a crystal of <a class="uri" href="calcite" title="wikilink">calcite</a> as photographed above. Rotating the calcite crystal will cause one of the two images, that of the extraordinary ray, to rotate slightly around that of the ordinary ray which remains fixed.</p>

<p>When the light propagates either along or orthogonal to the optic axis, such a lateral shift does not occur. In the first case, both polarizations see the same effective refractive index, so there is no extraordinary ray. In the second case the extraordinary ray propagates at a different phase velocity (corresponding to <em>n</em><sub>e</sub>) but is not an inhomogeneous wave. A crystal with its optic axis in this orientation, parallel to the optical surface, may be used to create a <a class="uri" href="waveplate" title="wikilink">waveplate</a>, in which there is no distortion of the image but an intentional modification of the state of polarization of the incident wave. For instance, a <a href="Waveplate#Quarter-wave_plate" title="wikilink">quarter-wave plate</a> is commonly used to create <a href="circular_polarization" title="wikilink">circular polarization</a> from a linearly polarized source.</p>
<h3 id="biaxial-materials">Biaxial materials</h3>

<p>The case of so-called biaxial crystals is substantially more complex.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> These are characterized by <em>three</em> refractive indices corresponding to two principal axes of the crystal. For most ray directions, <em>both</em> polarizations would be classified as extraordinary rays but with different effective refractive indices. Being extraordinary waves, however, the direction of power flow is not identical to the direction of the wave vector in either case.</p>

<p>The two refractive indices can be determined using the <a href="index_ellipsoid" title="wikilink">index ellipsoid</a> for waves with a given <a href="wave_vector" title="wikilink">wave vector</a>. Note that for biaxial crystals the index ellipsoid will <em>not</em> be an ellipsoid of revolution (or "<a class="uri" href="spheroid" title="wikilink">spheroid</a>") but is described by three unequal principle refractive indices <em>n</em><sub>α</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>γ</sub>. Thus there is no axis around which a rotation leaves the optical properties invariant (as there is with uniaxial crystals whose index ellipsoid <em>is</em> a spheroid).</p>
<h3 id="double-refraction">Double refraction</h3>

<p>When an arbitrary beam of light strikes the surface of a birefringent material, the polarizations corresponding to the ordinary and extraordinary rays generally take somewhat different paths. <a href="Polarization_(waves)#Unpolarized_and_partially_polarized_light" title="wikilink">Unpolarized light</a> consists of equal amounts of energy in any two orthogonal polarizations, and even polarized light (except in special cases) will have some energy in each of these polarizations. According to <a href="Snell's_law" title="wikilink">Snell's law</a> of refraction, the angle of refraction will be governed by the effective <a href="refractive_index" title="wikilink">refractive index</a> which is different between these two polarizations. This is clearly seen, for instance, in the <a href="Wollaston_prism" title="wikilink">Wollaston prism</a> which is designed to separate incoming light into two linear polarizations using a birefringent material such as <a class="uri" href="calcite" title="wikilink">calcite</a>.</p>

<p>The different angles of refraction for the two polarization components are shown in the figure at the top of the page, with the optic axis along the surface (and perpendicular to the <a href="plane_of_incidence" title="wikilink">plane of incidence</a>), so that the angle of refraction is different for the <em>p</em> polarization (the "ordinary ray" in this case, having its polarization perpendicular to the optic axis) and the <em>s</em> polarization (the "extraordinary ray" with a polarization component along the optic axis). In addition, a distinct form of double refraction occurs in cases where the optic axis is not along the refracting surface (nor exactly normal to it); in this case the <a href="electric_polarization" title="wikilink">electric polarization</a> of the birefringent material is not exactly in the direction of the wave's <a href="electric_field" title="wikilink">electric field</a> for the extraordinary ray. The direction of power flow (given by the <a href="Poynting_vector" title="wikilink">Poynting vector</a>) for this <a href="inhomogenous_wave" title="wikilink">inhomogenous wave</a> is at a finite angle from the direction of the <a href="wave_vector" title="wikilink">wave vector</a> resulting in an additional separation between these beams. So even in the case of normal incidence, where the angle of refraction is zero (according to Snell's law, regardless of effective index of refraction), the energy of the extraordinary ray may be propagated at an angle. This is commonly observed using a piece of calcite cut appropriately with respect to its optic axis, placed above a paper with writing, as in the above two photographs.</p>
<h2 id="terminology">Terminology</h2>

<p>Much of the work involving polarization preceded the understanding of light as a transverse <a href="electromagnetic_wave" title="wikilink">electromagnetic wave</a>, and this has affected some terminology in use. Isotropic materials have symmetry in all directions and the refractive index is the same for any polarization direction. An anisotropic material is called "birefringent" because it will generally refract a single incoming ray in two directions, which we now understand correspond to the two different polarizations. This is true of either a uniaxial or biaxial material.</p>

<p>In a uniaxial material, one ray behaves according to the normal law of refraction (corresponding to the ordinary refractive index), so an incoming ray at normal incidence remains normal to the refracting surface. However, as explained above, the other polarization can be deviated from normal incidence, which cannot be described using the law of refraction. This thus became known as the <em>extraordinary ray</em>. The terms "ordinary" and "extraordinary" are still applied to the polarization components perpendicular to and not perpendicular to the optic axis respectively, even in cases where no double refraction is involved.</p>

<p>A material is termed <em>uniaxial</em> when it has a single direction of symmetry in its optical behavior, which we term the optic axis. It also happens to be the axis of symmetry of the index ellipsoid (a spheroid in this case). The index ellipsoid could still be described according to the refractive indices, <em>n</em><sub>α</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> and <em>n</em><sub>γ</sub>, along three coordinate axes, however in this case two are equal. So if <em>n</em><sub>α</sub> = <em>n</em><sub>β</sub> corresponding to the <strong>x</strong> and <strong>y</strong> axes, then the extraordinary index is <em>n</em><sub>γ</sub> corresponding to the <strong>z</strong> axis, which is also called the <em>optic axis</em> in this case.</p>

<p>However materials in which all three refractive indices are different are termed <em>biaxial</em> and the origin of this term is more complicated and frequently misunderstood. In a uniaxial crystal, different polarization components of a beam will travel at different phase velocities, <em>except</em> for rays in the direction of what we call the optic axis. Thus the optic axis has the particular property that rays in that direction do <em>not</em> exhibit birefringence, with all polarizations in such a beam experiencing the same index of refraction. It is very different when the three principal refractive indices are all different; then an incoming ray in any of those principle directions will still encounter two different refractive indices. But it turns out that there are two special directions (at an angle to all of the 3 axes) where the refractive indices for different polarizations are again equal. For this reason, these crystals were designated as <em>biaxial</em>, with the two "axes" in this case referring to ray directions in which propagation does not experience birefringence.</p>
<h3 id="fast-and-slow-rays">Fast and slow rays</h3>

<p>In a birefringent material, a wave consists of two polarization components which generally are governed by different effective refractive indices. The so-called <em>slow ray</em> is the component for which the material has the higher effective refractive index (slower phase velocity), while the <em>fast ray</em> is the one with a lower effective refractive index. When a beam is incident on such a material from air (or any material with a lower refractive index), the slow ray is thus refracted more towards the normal than the fast ray. In the figure at the top of the page, it can be seen that refracted ray with <em>s</em> polarization in the direction of the optic axis (thus the extraordinary ray) is the slow ray in this case.</p>

<p>Using a thin slab of that material at normal incidence, one would implement a <a class="uri" href="waveplate" title="wikilink">waveplate</a>. In this case there is essentially no spatial separation between the polarizations, however the phase of the wave in the parallel polarization (the slow ray) will be retarded with respect to the perpendicular polarization. These directions are thus known as the slow axis and fast axis of the waveplate.</p>
<h3 id="positive-or-negative">Positive or negative</h3>

<p>Uniaxial birefringence is classified as positive when the extraordinary index of refraction n<sub>e</sub> is greater than the ordinary index n<sub>o</sub>. Negative birefringence means that Δn = n<sub>e</sub> - n<sub>o</sub> is less than zero.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In other words, the polarization of the fast (or slow) wave is perpendicular to the optic axis when the birefringence of the crystal is positive (or negative, respectively). In the case of biaxial crystals, all three of the principal axes have different refractive indices so this designation does not apply. But for any defined ray direction one can just as well designate the fast and slow ray polarizations.</p>
<h2 id="sources-of-optical-birefringence">Sources of optical birefringence</h2>

<p>While birefringence is usually obtained using an anisotropic crystal, it can result from an <a href="optical_isotropy" title="wikilink">optically isotropic</a> material in a few ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Stress birefringence</em> results when isotropic materials are stressed or deformed such that the isotropy is lost in one direction (i.e., stretched or bent).</li>
<li>Intrinsic birefringence, whereby the material has more than one chemical group with differing refractive indices that have some preferential order that results in optical rotation.</li>
<li>Form birefringence, whereby structure elements, such as rods or spheres having one refractive index, are suspended in a media with a second refractive index.</li>
<li>By the <a href="Kerr_effect" title="wikilink">Kerr effect</a>, whereby an applied electric field induces birefringence at optical frequencies through the effect of <a href="nonlinear_optics" title="wikilink">nonlinear optics</a>;</li>
<li>By the <a href="Faraday_effect" title="wikilink">Faraday effect</a>, where a magnetic field causes some materials to become <em><a href="Optical_rotation" title="wikilink">circularly birefringent</a></em> (having slightly different indices of refraction for left and right handed <a href="circular_polarization" title="wikilink">circular polarizations</a>), making the material <em>optically active</em> until the field is removed;</li>
<li>By the self or forced alignment into thin films of <a href="amphiphile" title="wikilink">amphiphilic</a> molecules such as <a class="uri" href="lipids" title="wikilink">lipids</a>, some <a class="uri" href="surfactants" title="wikilink">surfactants</a> or <a href="liquid_crystals" title="wikilink">liquid crystals</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="common-birefringent-materials">Common birefringent materials</h2>

<p>The best-characterized birefringent materials are <a class="uri" href="crystals" title="wikilink">crystals</a>. Due to their specific <a href="crystal_structures" title="wikilink">crystal structures</a> their refractive indices are well defined. Depending on the symmetry of a crystal structure (as determined by one of the 219 possible crystallographic <a href="space_groups" title="wikilink">space groups</a>), crystals in that group may be forced to be isotropic (not birefringent), to have uniaxial symmetry, or neither in which case it is a biaxial crystal. The crystal structures permitting uniaxial and biaxial birefringence are noted in the two tables, below, listing the two or three principle refractive indices (at wavelength 590 nm) of some better known crystals.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>

<p>Many <a href="plastic" title="wikilink">plastics</a> are birefringent, because their molecules are 'frozen' in a stretched conformation when the plastic is molded or extruded.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> For example, ordinary <a class="uri" href="cellophane" title="wikilink">cellophane</a> is birefringent. <a href="Polarizer" title="wikilink">Polarizers</a> are routinely used to detect stress in plastics such as <a class="uri" href="polystyrene" title="wikilink">polystyrene</a> and <a class="uri" href="polycarbonate" title="wikilink">polycarbonate</a>.</p>

<p><a class="uri" href="Cotton" title="wikilink">Cotton</a> fiber is birefringent because of high levels of cellulosic material in the fiber's secondary cell wall.</p>

<p>Polarized light microscopy is commonly used in biological tissue, as many biological materials are birefringent. Collagen, found in cartilage, tendon, bone, corneas, and several other areas in the body, is birefringent and commonly studied with polarized light microscopy.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Some proteins are also birefringent, exhibiting form birefringence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<p>Inevitable manufacturing imperfections in <a href="optical_fiber" title="wikilink">optical fiber</a> leads to birefringence which is one cause of <a href="polarization_mode_dispersion" title="wikilink">pulse broadening</a> in <a href="fiber-optic_communication" title="wikilink">fiber-optic communications</a>. Such imperfections can be geometrical (lack of circular symmetry), due to stress applied to the optical fiber, and/or due to bending of the fiber. Birefringence is <em>intentionally</em> introduced (for instance, by making the cross-section elliptical) in order to produce <a href="polarization-maintaining_optical_fiber" title="wikilink">polarization-maintaining optical fibers</a>.</p>

<p>In addition to anisotropy in the electric polarizability (<a href="electric_susceptibility" title="wikilink">electric susceptibility</a>), anisotropy in the magnetic polarizability (<a href="Permeability_(electromagnetism)" title="wikilink">magnetic permeability</a>) can also cause birefringence. However at optical frequencies, values of magnetic permeability for natural materials are not measurably different from <a href="Vacuum_permeability" title="wikilink"><em>µ</em><sub>0</sub></a> so this is not a source of optical birefringence in practice.</p>

<h2 id="measurement">Measurement</h2>

<p>Birefringence and other polarization based optical effects (such as <a href="optical_rotation" title="wikilink">optical rotation</a> and linear or <a href="circular_dichroism" title="wikilink">circular dichroism</a>) can be measured by measuring the changes in the polarization of light passing through the material. These measurements are known as <a class="uri" href="polarimetry" title="wikilink">polarimetry</a>. Polarized light microscopes, which contain two polarizers that are at 90 degrees to each other on either side of the sample, are used to visualize birefringence. The addition of quarter wave plates permit examination of circularly polarized light. Birefringence measurements have been made with phase-modulated systems for examining the transient flow behavior of fluids.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a></p>

<p>Birefringence of <a href="lipid_bilayers" title="wikilink">lipid bilayers</a> can be measured using <a href="dual_polarisation_interferometry" title="wikilink">dual polarisation interferometry</a>. This provides a measure of the degree of order within these fluid layers and how this order is disrupted when the layer interacts with other biomolecules.</p>
<h2 id="applications">Applications</h2>

<p> Birefringence is used in many optical devices. <a href="Liquid_crystal_display" title="wikilink">Liquid crystal displays</a>, the most common sort of <a href="flat_panel_display" title="wikilink">flat panel display</a>, cause their pixels to become lighter or darker through rotation of the polarization (circular birefringence) of linearly polarized light as viewed through a sheet polarizer at the screen's surface. Similarly, <a href="electro-optic_modulator" title="wikilink">light modulators</a> modulate the intensity of light through <a href="Pockels_cell" title="wikilink">electrically induced birefringence</a> of polarized light followed by a polarizer. The <a href="Lyot_filter" title="wikilink">Lyot filter</a> is a specialized narrowband spectral filter employing the wavelength dependence of birefringence. <a href="Wave_plate" title="wikilink">Wave plates</a> are thin birefringent sheets widely used in certain optical equipment for modifying the polarization state of light passing through it.</p>

<p>Birefringence also plays an important role in <a href="second_harmonic_generation" title="wikilink">second harmonic generation</a> and other <a href="Nonlinear_optics" title="wikilink">nonlinear optical components</a>, as the crystals used for this purpose are almost always birefringent. By adjusting the angle of incidence, the effective refractive index of the extraordinary ray can be tuned in order to achieve <a href="Nonlinear_optics#Phase_matching" title="wikilink">phase matching</a> which is required for efficient operation of these devices.</p>
<h3 id="medicine">Medicine</h3>

<p>Birefringence is utilized in medical diagnostics. One powerful accessory used with optical microscopes is a pair of crossed <a href="polarizer" title="wikilink">polarizing</a> filters. Light from the source is polarized in the X direction after passing through the first polarizer, but above the specimen is a polarizer (a so-called <em>analyzer</em>) oriented in the Y direction. Therefore, no light from the source will be accepted by the analyzer, and the field will appear dark. However areas of the sample possessing birefringence will generally couple some of the X polarized light into the Y polarization; these areas will then appear bright against the dark background. Modifications to this basic principle can differentiate between positive and negative birefringence.</p>

<p> For instance, needle aspiration of fluid from a <a href="gout" title="wikilink">gouty</a> joint will reveal negatively birefringent monosodium <a class="uri" href="urate" title="wikilink">urate</a> crystals. <a href="Calcium_pyrophosphate" title="wikilink">Calcium pyrophosphate</a> crystals, in contrast, show weak positive birefringence.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Urate crystals appear yellow and calcium pyrophosphate crystals appear blue when their long axes are aligned parallel to that of a red compensator filter,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> or a crystal of known birefringence is added to the sample for comparison.</p>

<p>Birefringence can be observed in <a class="uri" href="amyloid" title="wikilink">amyloid</a> plaques such as are found in the brains of <a href="Alzheimer's_disease" title="wikilink">Alzheimer's</a> patients when stained with a dye such as Congo Red. Modified proteins such as <a class="uri" href="immunoglobulin" title="wikilink">immunoglobulin</a> light chains abnormally accumulate between cells, forming fibrils. Multiple folds of these fibers line up and take on a beta-pleated sheet <a href="Chemical_structure" title="wikilink">conformation</a>. <a href="Congo_red" title="wikilink">Congo red</a> dye <a href="intercalation_(chemistry)" title="wikilink">intercalates</a> between the folds and, when observed under polarized light, causes birefringence.</p>

<p>In <a class="uri" href="ophthalmology" title="wikilink">ophthalmology</a>, binocular retinal birefringence screening of the <em>Henle fibers</em> (photoreceptor axons that go radially outward from the fovea) provides a reliable detection of <a class="uri" href="strabismus" title="wikilink">strabismus</a> and possibly also of <a href="Amblyopia#Refractive_or_anisometropic_amblyopia" title="wikilink">anisometropic amblyopia</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a> Furthermore, <a href="scanning_laser_polarimetry" title="wikilink">scanning laser polarimetry</a> utilises the birefringence of the <a href="optic_nerve" title="wikilink">optic nerve</a> fibre layer to indirectly quantify its thickness, which is of use in the assessment and monitoring of <a class="uri" href="glaucoma" title="wikilink">glaucoma</a>.</p>

<h3 id="stress-induced-birefringence">Stress induced birefringence</h3>

<p> <a class="uri" href="Isotropic" title="wikilink">Isotropic</a> solids do not exhibit birefringence. However, when they are under <a href="mechanical_stress" title="wikilink">mechanical stress</a>, birefringence results. The stress can be applied externally or is "frozen in" after a birefringent plastic ware is cooled after it is manufactured using <a href="injection_molding" title="wikilink">injection molding</a>. When such a sample is placed between two crossed polarizers, colour patterns can be observed, because polarization of a light ray is rotated after passing through a birefingent material and the amount of rotation is dependent on wavelength. The experimental method called <a class="uri" href="photoelasticity" title="wikilink">photoelasticity</a> used for analyzing stress distribution in solids is based on the same principle.</p>
<h3 id="other-cases-of-birefringence">Other cases of birefringence</h3>

<p>Birefringence is observed in anisotropic <a href="elastic_deformation" title="wikilink">elastic</a> materials. In these materials, the two polarizations split according to their effective refractive indices which are also sensitive to stress.</p>

<p>The study of birefringence in shear waves traveling through the solid earth (the earth's liquid core does not support shear waves) is widely used in <a class="uri" href="seismology" title="wikilink">seismology</a>.</p>

<p>Birefringence is widely used in mineralogy to identify rocks, minerals, and gemstones.</p>

<p>In the case of a uniaxial material, choosing the optic axis to be in the z direction so that <em>n</em><sub>x</sub>=<em>n</em><sub>y</sub>=<em>n<sub>o</sub></em> and <em>n<sub>z</sub></em>=<em>n<sub>e</sub></em>, this expression can be factored into</p>

<p>Setting either of the factors in equation (8) to zero will define an ellipsoidal surface in the space of wave vectors <strong>k</strong> that are allowed for a given <em>ω</em>. The first factor being zero defines a sphere corresponding to ordinary rays, in which the effective refractive index is exactly <em>n<sub>o</sub></em>. The second defines a <a class="uri" href="spheroid" title="wikilink">spheroid</a> symmetric about the z axis. This solution corresponds to extraordinary rays in which the effective refractive index is in between <em>n<sub>o</sub></em> and <em>n<sub>e</sub></em>. Therefore, for any arbitrary direction of propagation, two distinct wavevectors <strong>k</strong> are allowed corresponding to the polarizations of the ordinary and extraordinary rays. A general state of polarization launched into the medium can be decomposed into two such waves which will then propagate with different <strong>k</strong> vectors (except in the case of propagation in the direction of the optic axis).</p>

<p>For a biaxial material a similar but more complicated condition on the two waves can be described.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> What can be seen from the equation is the following: for a given <strong>k</strong>, there are two positive values of <em>ω</em> that solve the above quartic equation (8). The values <em>ω</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, i=1,2, correspond to two perpendicular linear polarizations <em>D</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>i</em> = 1,2 of the displacement vector in the 2-plane <strong>k</strong><sup>⊥</sup>. Alternately put, since the dispersion relation is linear, for a fixed frequency <em>ω</em> and direction of motion <strong>k</strong>/|<strong>k</strong>|, there are there are two admissible wavenumbers <em>k</em><sub>i</sub> and effective refractive indices <em>n</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>=<em>n</em><sub><em>i</em></sub> (<strong>k</strong>/|<strong>k</strong>|) corresponding to the polarization directions <em>D</em><sub><em>i</em></sub>, <em>i</em> = 1,2. If <em>n</em><sub>1</sub> = <em>n</em><sub>2</sub>, then the effective refractive index is independent of the direction of polarization, and there is consequently no visible birefringence if light is shined in this direction. Such a direction <strong>k</strong> defines an <em>axis</em> through the crystal. In the case of generic, distinct principal refractive indices, <em>n</em><sub>x</sub>, <em>n</em><sub>y</sub>, <em>n<sub>z</sub></em>, further analysis shows that there are exactly two axes, which led historically to the "bi" in "biaxial".</p>
