P-benzoquinone reductase (NADPH)




P-benzoquinone reductase (NADPH)

In enzymology, a p-benzoquinone reductase (NADPH) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

NADPH + H+ + p-benzoquinone 
 
 
 
  NADP+ + hydroquinone
 

The 3 substrates of this enzyme are NADPH, H+, and p-benzoquinone, whereas its two products are NADP+ and hydroquinone.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on NADH or NADPH with a quinone or similar compound as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is NADPH:p-benzoquinone oxidoreductase. This enzyme participates in gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane degradation.
