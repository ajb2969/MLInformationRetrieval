   Nowhere-zero flow      Nowhere-zero flow   In graph theory , nowhere-zero flows are a special type of network flow which is related (by duality) to coloring  planar graphs .  Definition  Let G = (V,E) be a directed graph and let M be an abelian group . A map φ: E → M is a flow or an M - flow if for every vertex  v ∈ V , it holds that         ∑   e  ∈    δ  +    (  v  )       φ   (  e  )     =    ∑   e  ∈    δ  -    (  v  )       φ   (  e  )      ,        subscript     e     superscript  δ    v       φ  e      subscript     e     superscript  δ    v       φ  e      \sum_{e\in\delta^{+}(v)}\varphi(e)=\sum_{e\in\delta^{-}(v)}\varphi(e),   where δ + (v) denotes the set of edges out of v and δ − (v) denotes the set of edges into v . Sometimes, this condition is referred to as Kirchhoff's law . If φ(e) ≠ 0 for every e ∈ E , we call φ a nowhere-zero flow. If M = Z is the group of integers under addition and k is a positive integer with the property that – k |\delta^+(v)| \equiv |\delta^-(v)| \pmod{k} for every vertex v ∈ V .  Properties  Modify a nowhere-zero flow φ on a graph G by choosing an edge e , reversing it, and then replacing φ(e) with -φ(e) . After this adjustment, φ is still a nowhere-zero flow. Furthermore, if φ was originally a k -flow, then the resulting φ is also a k -flow. Thus, the existence of a nowhere-zero M -flow or a nowhere-zero k -flow is independent of the orientation of the graph. Thus, an undirected graph G is said to have a nowhere-zero M -flow or nowhere-zero k -flow if some (and thus every) orientation of G has such a flow.  More surprisingly, if M is a finite abelian group of size k , then the number of a nowhere-zero M -flows in some graph does not depend on the structure of M but only on k , the size of M . Furthermore, the existence of a M -flow coincides with the existence of a k -flow. These two results were proved by Tutte in 1953. 1  Flow/coloring duality  Let G = (V,E) be a directed bridgeless graph drawn in the plane, and assume that the regions of this drawing are properly k -colored with the colors {0, 1, 2, .., k – 1}. Now, construct a map φ: E(G) → {–( k – 1), ..., –1, 0, 1, ..., k – 1} by the following rule: if the edge e has a region of color x to the left and a region of color y to the right, then let φ(e) = x – y . It is an easy exercise to show that φ is a k -flow. Furthermore, since the regions were properly colored, φ is a nowhere-zero k -flow. It follows from this construction, that if G and G* are planar dual graphs and G* is k -colorable, then G has a nowhere-zero k -flow. Tutte proved that the converse of this statement is also true. Thus, for planar graphs, nowhere-zero flows are dual to colorings. Since nowhere-zero flows make sense for general graphs (not just graphs drawn in the plane), this study can be viewed as an extension of coloring theory for non-planar graphs.  Theory  Just as no graph with a loop edge has a proper coloring, no graph with a bridge can have a nowhere-zero flow (in any group). It is easy to show that every graph without a bridge has a nowhere-zero Z -flow (a form of Robbins theorem ), but interesting questions arise when trying to find nowhere-zero k -flows for small values of k . Two nice theorems in this direction are Jaeger's 4-flow theorem (every 4- edge-connected graph has a nowhere-zero 4-flow) 2 and Seymour's 6-flow theorem (every bridgeless graph has a nowhere-zero 6-flow). 3  Tutte conjectured that every bridgeless graph has a nowhere-zero 5-flow 4 and that every bridgeless graph that does not have the Petersen graph as a minor has a nowhere-zero 4-flow. 5 For cubic graphs with no Petersen minor, a 4-flow is known to exist as a consequence of the snark theorem but for arbitrary graphs these conjectures remain open.
