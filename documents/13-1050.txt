   Direct method in the calculus of variations      Direct method in the calculus of variations   In the calculus of variations , a topic in mathematics , the direct method is a general method for constructing a proof of the existence of a minimizer for a given functional , 1 introduced by Zaremba and David Hilbert around 1900. The method relies on methods of functional analysis and topology . As well as being used to prove the existence of a solution, direct methods may be used to compute the solution to desired accuracy. 2  The method  The calculus of variations deals with functionals    J  :   V  →   ℝ  ¯       normal-:  J   normal-→  V   normal-¯  ℝ      J:V\to\bar{\mathbb{R}}   , where   V   V   V   is some function space and     ℝ  ¯   =   ℝ  ∪   {  ∞  }         normal-¯  ℝ     ℝ        \bar{\mathbb{R}}=\mathbb{R}\cup\{\infty\}   . The main interest of the subject is to find minimizers for such functionals, that is, functions    v  ∈  V      v  V    v\in V   such that      J   (  v  )    ≤   J   (  u  )    ∀  u    ∈  V   .          J  v     J  u   for-all  u         V     J(v)\leq J(u)\forall u\in V.     The standard tool for obtaining necessary conditions for a function to be a minimizer is the Euler–Lagrange equation . But seeking a minimizer amongst functions satisfying these may lead to false conclusions if the existence of a minimizer is not established beforehand.  The functional   J   J   J   must be bounded from below to have a minimizer. This means        inf   {   J   (  u  )    |   u  ∈  V   }    >   -  ∞    .       infimum   conditional-set    J  u     u  V           \inf\{J(u)|u\in V\}>-\infty.\,     This condition is not enough to know that a minimizer exists, but it shows the existence of a minimizing sequence , that is, a sequence    (   u  n   )     subscript  u  n    (u_{n})   in   V   V   V   such that      J   (   u  n   )    →   inf   {   J   (  u  )    |   u  ∈  V   }     .     normal-→    J   subscript  u  n     infimum   conditional-set    J  u     u  V       J(u_{n})\to\inf\{J(u)|u\in V\}.     The direct method may broken into the following steps   Take a minimizing sequence    (   u  n   )     subscript  u  n    (u_{n})   for   J   J   J   .  Show that    (   u  n   )     subscript  u  n    (u_{n})   admits some subsequence     (   u   n  k    )     subscript  u   subscript  n  k     (u_{n_{k}})   , that converges to a     u  0   ∈  V       subscript  u  0   V    u_{0}\in V   with respect to a topology   τ   τ   \tau   on   V   V   V   .  Show that   J   J   J   is sequentially lower semi-continuous with respect to the topology   τ   τ   \tau   .   To see that this shows the existence of a minimizer, consider the following characterization of sequentially lower-semicontinuous functions.   The function   J   J   J   is sequentially lower-semicontinuous if       lim inf   n  →  ∞     J   (   u  n   )     ≥   J   (   u  0   )          subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n       J   subscript  u  n       J   subscript  u  0      \liminf_{n\to\infty}J(u_{n})\geq J(u_{0})   for any convergent sequence     u  n   →   u  0      normal-→   subscript  u  n    subscript  u  0     u_{n}\to u_{0}   in   V   V   V   .    The conclusions follows from       inf   {   J   (  u  )    |   u  ∈  V   }    =    lim   n  →  ∞     J   (   u  n   )     =    lim   k  →  ∞     J   (   u   n  k    )     ≥   J   (   u  0   )    ≥   inf   {   J   (  u  )    |   u  ∈  V   }           infimum   conditional-set    J  u     u  V       subscript    normal-→  n       J   subscript  u  n            subscript    normal-→  k       J   subscript  u   subscript  n  k             J   subscript  u  0          infimum   conditional-set    J  u     u  V        \inf\{J(u)|u\in V\}=\lim_{n\to\infty}J(u_{n})=\lim_{k\to\infty}J(u_{n_{k}})%
 \geq J(u_{0})\geq\inf\{J(u)|u\in V\}   , in other words       J   (   u  0   )    =   inf   {   J   (  u  )    |   u  ∈  V   }          J   subscript  u  0     infimum   conditional-set    J  u     u  V       J(u_{0})=\inf\{J(u)|u\in V\}   .  Details  Banach spaces  The direct method may often be applied with success when the space   V   V   V   is a subset of a separable  reflexive  Banach space    W   W   W   . In this case the sequential Banach–Alaoglu theorem implies that any bounded sequence    (   u  n   )     subscript  u  n    (u_{n})   in   V   V   V   has a subsequence that converges to some    u  0     subscript  u  0    u_{0}   in   W   W   W   with respect to the weak topology . If   V   V   V   is sequentially closed in   W   W   W   , so that    u  0     subscript  u  0    u_{0}   is in   V   V   V   , the direct method may be applied to a functional    J  :   V  →   ℝ  ¯       normal-:  J   normal-→  V   normal-¯  ℝ      J:V\to\bar{\mathbb{R}}   by showing      J   J   J   is bounded from below,  any minimizing sequence for   J   J   J   is bounded, and     J   J   J   is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous, i.e., for any weakly convergent sequence     u  n   →   u  0      normal-→   subscript  u  n    subscript  u  0     u_{n}\to u_{0}   it holds that      lim inf   n  →  ∞     J   (   u  n   )     ≥   J   (   u  0   )          subscript  limit-infimum   normal-→  n       J   subscript  u  n       J   subscript  u  0      \liminf_{n\to\infty}J(u_{n})\geq J(u_{0})   .   The second part is usually accomplished by showing that   J   J   J   admits some growth condition. An example is       J   (  x  )    ≥    α    ∥  x  ∥   q    -  β         J  x       α   superscript   norm  x   q    β     J(x)\geq\alpha\lVert x\rVert^{q}-\beta   for some    α  >  0      α  0    \alpha>0   ,    q  ≥  1      q  1    q\geq 1   and    β  ≥  0      β  0    \beta\geq 0   . A functional with this property is sometimes called coercive. Showing sequential lower semi-continuity is usually the most difficult part when applying the direct method. See below for some theorems for a general class of functionals.  Sobolev spaces  The typical functional in the calculus of variations is an integral of the form       J   (  u  )    =    ∫  Ω    F   (  x  ,   u   (  x  )    ,    ∇  u    (  x  )    )   d  x          J  u     subscript   normal-Ω     F   x    u  x      normal-∇  u   x    d  x      J(u)=\int_{\Omega}F(x,u(x),\nabla u(x))dx   where   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   is a subset of    ℝ  n     superscript  ℝ  n    \mathbb{R}^{n}   and   F   F   F   is a real-valued function on    Ω  ×   ℝ  m   ×   ℝ   m  n        normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  m    superscript  ℝ    m  n      \Omega\times\mathbb{R}^{m}\times\mathbb{R}^{mn}   . The argument of   J   J   J   is a differentiable function    u  :   Ω  →   ℝ  m       normal-:  u   normal-→  normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  m      u:\Omega\to\mathbb{R}^{m}   , and its Jacobian      ∇  u    (  x  )        normal-∇  u   x    \nabla u(x)   is identified with a    m  n      m  n    mn   -vector.  When deriving the Euler–Lagrange equation, the common approach is to assume   Ω   normal-Ω   \Omega   has a    C  2     superscript  C  2    C^{2}   boundary and let the domain of definition for   J   J   J   be     C  2    (  Ω  ,   ℝ  m   )        superscript  C  2    normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  m      C^{2}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{m})   . This space is a Banach space when endowed with the supremum norm , but it is not reflexive. When applying the direct method, the functional is usually defined on a Sobolev space      W   1  ,  p     (  Ω  ,   ℝ  m   )        superscript  W   1  p     normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  m      W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{m})   with    p  >  1      p  1    p>1   , which is a reflexive Banach space. The derivatives of   u   u   u   in the formula for   J   J   J   must then be taken as weak derivatives . The next section presents two theorems regarding weak sequential lower semi-continuity of functionals of the above type.  Sequential lower semi-continuity of integrals  As many functionals in the calculus of variations are of the form       J   (  u  )    =    ∫  Ω    F   (  x  ,   u   (  x  )    ,    ∇  u    (  x  )    )   d  x          J  u     subscript   normal-Ω     F   x    u  x      normal-∇  u   x    d  x      J(u)=\int_{\Omega}F(x,u(x),\nabla u(x))dx   , where    Ω  ⊆   ℝ  n       normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  n     \Omega\subseteq\mathbb{R}^{n}   is open, theorems characterizing functions   F   F   F   for which   J   J   J   is weakly sequentially lower-semicontinuous in     W   1  ,  p     (  Ω  ,   ℝ  m   )        superscript  W   1  p     normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  m      W^{1,p}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{m})   is of great importance.  In general we have the following 3   Assume that   F   F   F   is a function such that  The function     (  y  ,  p  )   ↦   F   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )       maps-to   y  p     F   x  y  p      (y,p)\mapsto F(x,y,p)   is continuous for almost every     x  ∈  Ω      x  normal-Ω    x\in\Omega   ,  the function    x  ↦   F   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )       maps-to  x    F   x  y  p      x\mapsto F(x,y,p)   is measurable for every     (  y  ,  p  )   ∈    ℝ  m   ×   ℝ   m  n          y  p      superscript  ℝ  m    superscript  ℝ    m  n       (y,p)\in\mathbb{R}^{m}\times\mathbb{R}^{mn}   , and       F   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )    ≥     a   (  x  )    ⋅  p   +   b   (  x  )           F   x  y  p       normal-⋅    a  x   p     b  x      F(x,y,p)\geq a(x)\cdot p+b(x)   for a fixed    a  ∈    L  q    (  Ω  ,   ℝ  m   )        a     superscript  L  q    normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  m       a\in L^{q}(\Omega,\mathbb{R}^{m})   where      1  /  q   +   1  /  p    =  1          1  q     1  p    1    1/q+1/p=1   , a fixed    b  ∈    L  1    (  Ω  )        b     superscript  L  1   normal-Ω     b\in L^{1}(\Omega)   , for a.e.    x  ∈  Ω      x  normal-Ω    x\in\Omega   and every     (  y  ,  p  )   ∈    ℝ  m   ×   ℝ   m  n          y  p      superscript  ℝ  m    superscript  ℝ    m  n       (y,p)\in\mathbb{R}^{m}\times\mathbb{R}^{mn}   (here     a   (  x  )    ⋅  p     normal-⋅    a  x   p    a(x)\cdot p   means the inner product of    a   (  x  )       a  x    a(x)   and   p   p   p   in    ℝ   m  n      superscript  ℝ    m  n     \mathbb{R}^{mn}   ).    The following holds. If the function    p  ↦   F   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )       maps-to  p    F   x  y  p      p\mapsto F(x,y,p)   is convex for a.e.    x  ∈  Ω      x  normal-Ω    x\in\Omega   and every    y  ∈   ℝ  m       y   superscript  ℝ  m     y\in\mathbb{R}^{m}   ,  then   J   J   J   is sequentially weakly lower semi-continuous.   When    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   or    m  =  1      m  1    m=1   the following converse-like theorem holds 4   Assume that   F   F   F   is continuous and satisfies      |   F   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )    |   ≤   a   (  x  ,   |  y  |   ,   |  p  |   )            F   x  y  p       a   x    y     p       |F(x,y,p)|\leq a(x,|y|,|p|)      for every    (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )     x  y  p    (x,y,p)   , and a fixed function    a   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )       a   x  y  p     a(x,y,p)   increasing in   y   y   y   and   p   p   p   , and locally integrable in   x   x   x   . It then holds, if   J   J   J   is sequentially weakly lower semi-continuous, then for any given     (  x  ,  y  )   ∈   Ω  ×   ℝ  m         x  y     normal-Ω   superscript  ℝ  m      (x,y)\in\Omega\times\mathbb{R}^{m}   the function    p  ↦   F   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )       maps-to  p    F   x  y  p      p\mapsto F(x,y,p)   is convex.   In conclusion, when    m  =  1      m  1    m=1   or    n  =  1      n  1    n=1   , the functional   J   J   J   , assuming reasonable growth and boundedness on   F   F   F   , is weakly sequentially lower semi-continuous if, and only if, the function    p  ↦   F   (  x  ,  y  ,  p  )       maps-to  p    F   x  y  p      p\mapsto F(x,y,p)   is convex. If both   n   n   n   and   m   m   m   are greater than 1, it is possible to weaken the necessity of convexity to generalizations of convexity, namely polyconvexity and quasiconvexity. 5  Notes  References and further reading     Jindřich Nečas: Direct Methods in the Theory of Elliptic Equations .
