<h1>List of character tables for chemically important 3D point groups</h1>
<hr>This lists the [[character table]]s for the more common [[point groups in three dimensions|molecular point groups]] used in the study of [[molecular symmetry]].  These tables are based on the [[group theory|group-theoretical]] treatment of the [[symmetry]] operations present in common [[molecule]]s, and are useful in molecular [[spectroscopy]] and [[quantum chemistry]].  Information regarding the use of the tables, as well as more extensive lists of them, can be found in the references.<ref>{{cite book | last = Drago | first = Russell S. | title = Physical Methods in Chemistry | publisher = W.B.
