The Greek text of this codex is a representative of the Alexandrian text-type. Aland ascribed it as a “strict text”, and placed it in Category I.3

Acts 12:25 it reads εξ Ιερουσαλημ (from Jerusalem) along with A, 33, 69, 630, 2127; majority reads εις Ιερουσαλημ (to Jerusalem);4



It does not contain Acts 15:34 as codices Sinaiticus, Alexandrinus, Vaticanus, E, Ψ, Byz.5



Acts 20:28 it reads του κυριου (of the Lord) — A C* D E Ψ 33 36 453 945 1739 1891, instead of the Alexandrian του Θεου (of the God), or the Byzantine του κυριου και του Θεου (of the Lord and God).6

Acts 27:16 — καυδα (name of island), this reading is supported only by Vaticanus, 1175, Old-Latin version, Vulgate, and Peshitta.7
