   Geranyl diphosphate diphosphatase      Geranyl diphosphate diphosphatase   Geranyl diphosphate diphosphatase (, geraniol synthase , geranyl pyrophosphate pyrophosphatase , GES , CtGES ) is an enzyme with system name geranyl-diphosphate diphosphohydrolase . 1 2 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   geranyl diphosphate + H 2 O   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons    geraniol + diphosphate    This enzyme is isolated from Ocimum basilicum ( basil ) and Cinnamomum tenuipile ( camphor tree ).
