   Infinite-dimensional vector function      Infinite-dimensional vector function   Infinite-dimensional vector function refers to a function whose values lie in an infinite-dimensional  vector space , such as a Hilbert space or a Banach space .  Such functions are applied in most sciences including physics .  Example  Set      f  k    (  t  )    =   t  /   k  2           subscript  f  k   t     t   superscript  k  2      f_{k}(t)=t/k^{2}   for every positive integer k and every real number t . Then values of the function       f   (  t  )    =   (    f  1    (  t  )    ,    f  2    (  t  )    ,    f  3    (  t  )    ,  ‚Ä¶  )         f  t       subscript  f  1   t      subscript  f  2   t      subscript  f  3   t   normal-‚Ä¶     f(t)=(f_{1}(t),f_{2}(t),f_{3}(t),\ldots)\,   lie in the infinite-dimensional vector space X (or    ùêë  ùêç     superscript  ùêë  ùêç    \mathbf{R}^{\mathbf{N}}   ) of real-valued sequences. For example,        f   (  2  )    =   (  2  ,   2  4   ,   2  9   ,   2  16   ,   2  25   ,  ‚Ä¶  )    .        f  2    2    2  4     2  9     2  16     2  25   normal-‚Ä¶     f(2)=\left(2,\frac{2}{4},\frac{2}{9},\frac{2}{16},\frac{2}{25},\ldots\right).     As a number of different topologies can be defined on the space X , we cannot talk about the derivative of f without first defining the topology of X or the concept of a limit in X .  Moreover, for any set A , there exist infinite-dimensional vector spaces having the (Hamel) dimension of the cardinality of A (e.g., the space of functions    A  ‚Üí  K     normal-‚Üí  A  K    A\rightarrow K   with finitely-many nonzero elements, where K is the desired field of scalars ). Furthermore, the argument t could lie in any set instead of the set of real numbers.  Integral and derivative  If, e.g.,    f  :    [  0  ,  1  ]   ‚Üí  X      normal-:  f   normal-‚Üí   0  1   X     f:[0,1]\rightarrow X   , where X is a Banach space or another topological vector space , the derivative of f can be defined in the standard way      f  ‚Ä≤    (  t  )    :=    lim   h  ‚Üí  0       f   (   t  +  h   )    -   f   (  t  )     h       assign     superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤   t     subscript    normal-‚Üí  h  0          f    t  h      f  t    h      f^{\prime}(t):=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}   .  The measurability of f can be defined by a number of ways, most important of which are Bochner measurability and weak measurability .  The most important integrals of f are called Bochner integral (when X is a Banach space) and Pettis integral (when X is a topological vector space). Both these integrals commute with linear functionals . Also    L  p     superscript  L  p    L^{p}   spaces have been defined for such functions.  Most theorems on integration and differentiation of scalar functions can be generalized to vector-valued functions, often using essentially the same proofs. Perhaps the most important exception is that absolutely continuous functions need not equal the integrals of their (a.e.) derivatives (unless, e.g., X is a Hilbert space); see Radon‚ÄìNikodym theorem  Derivative  Functions with values in a Hilbert space  If f is a function of real numbers with values in a Hilbert space X , then the derivative of f at a point t can be defined as in the finite-dimensional case:         f  ‚Ä≤    (  t  )    =    lim   h  ‚Üí  0       f   (   t  +  h   )    -   f   (  t  )     h     .         superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤   t     subscript    normal-‚Üí  h  0          f    t  h      f  t    h      f^{\prime}(t)=\lim_{h\rightarrow 0}\frac{f(t+h)-f(t)}{h}.   Most results of the finite-dimensional case also hold in the infinite-dimensional case too, mutatis mutandis. Differentiation can also be defined to functions of several variables (e.g.,    t  ‚àà   R  n       t   superscript  R  n     t\in R^{n}   or even    t  ‚àà  Y      t  Y    t\in Y   , where Y is an infinite-dimensional vector space).  N.B. If X is a Hilbert space, then one can easily show that any derivative (and any other limit) can be computed componentwise: if      f  =   (   f  1   ,   f  2   ,   f  3   ,  ‚Ä¶  )       f    subscript  f  1    subscript  f  2    subscript  f  3   normal-‚Ä¶     f=(f_{1},f_{2},f_{3},\ldots)   (i.e.,    f  =     f  1    e  1    +    f  2    e  2    +    f  3    e  3    +  ‚ãØ       f       subscript  f  1    subscript  e  1       subscript  f  2    subscript  e  2       subscript  f  3    subscript  e  3    normal-‚ãØ     f=f_{1}e_{1}+f_{2}e_{2}+f_{3}e_{3}+\cdots   , where     e  1   ,   e  2   ,   e  3   ,  ‚Ä¶      subscript  e  1    subscript  e  2    subscript  e  3   normal-‚Ä¶    e_{1},e_{2},e_{3},\ldots   is an orthonormal basis of the space X ), and     f  ‚Ä≤    (  t  )        superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤   t    f^{\prime}(t)   exists, then        f  ‚Ä≤    (  t  )    =   (    f  1  ‚Ä≤    (  t  )    ,    f  2  ‚Ä≤    (  t  )    ,    f  3  ‚Ä≤    (  t  )    ,  ‚Ä¶  )          superscript  f  normal-‚Ä≤   t       superscript   subscript  f  1   normal-‚Ä≤   t      superscript   subscript  f  2   normal-‚Ä≤   t      superscript   subscript  f  3   normal-‚Ä≤   t   normal-‚Ä¶     f^{\prime}(t)=(f_{1}^{\prime}(t),f_{2}^{\prime}(t),f_{3}^{\prime}(t),\ldots)   . However, the existence of a componentwise derivative does not guarantee the existence of a derivative, as componentwise convergence in a Hilbert space does not guarantee convergence with respect to the actual topology of the Hilbert space.  Other infinite-dimensional vector spaces  Most of the above hold for other topological vector spaces  X too. However, not as many classical results hold in the Banach space setting, e.g., an absolutely continuous function with values in a suitable Banach space need not have a derivative anywhere. Moreover, in most Banach spaces setting there are no orthonormal bases.  References   Einar Hille & Ralph Phillips: "Functional Analysis and Semi Groups", Amer. Math. Soc. Colloq. Publ.
