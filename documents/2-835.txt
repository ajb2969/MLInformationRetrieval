Hölder's inequality

In mathematical analysis Hölder's inequality, named after Otto Hölder, is a fundamental inequality between integrals and an indispensable tool for the study of  spaces.

Theorem (Hölder's inequality). Let 
 
 
 
  be a measure space and let 
 
 

 
  with 
 
 
 
 
 . Then, for all measurable real- or complex-valued functions

 
  and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 ,
 










If, in addition, 
 
 

 
  and  and , then Hölder's inequality becomes an equality if and only if  and g{{!}}q}} are linearly dependent in , meaning that there exist real numbers 
 
 
 
 , not both of them zero, such that f {{!}}p {{=}} β {{!}}g{{!}}q}}

 
 -almost everywhere.
 

The numbers 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  above are said to be Hölder conjugates of each other. The special case 
 
 
 
  gives a form of the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality. Hölder's inequality holds even if  is infinite, the right-hand side also being infinite in that case. Conversely, if 
 
 
 
   is in  and 
 
 
 
  is in , then the pointwise product 
 
 
 
  is in .
Hölder's inequality is used to prove the Minkowski inequality, which is the triangle inequality in the space , and also to establish that  is the dual space of  for 
 
 

 
 .
Hölder's inequality was first found by , and discovered independently by .
Remarks
Conventions
The brief statement of Hölder's inequality uses some conventions.

In the definition of Hölder conjugates, 
 
 
 
  means zero.


If 
 
 

 
 , then  and  stand for the (possibly infinite) expressions







&\left(\int_S |f|^p\,\mathrm{d}\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{p}} \\ &\left(\int_S |g|^q\,\mathrm{d}\mu\right)^{\frac{1}{q}} \end{align}

If 
 
 
 
 
 , then  stands for the essential supremum of 
 
 
 
 , similarly for .


The notation  with 
 
 
 
  is a slight abuse, because in general it is only a norm of 
 
 
 
   if  is finite and 
 
 
 
   is considered as equivalence class of 
 
 
 
 
 -almost everywhere equal functions. If  and , then the notation is adequate.


On the right-hand side of Hölder's inequality, 0 × ∞ as well as ∞ × 0 means 0. Multiplying 
 
 
 
  with ∞ gives ∞.

Estimates for integrable products
As above, let 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
  denote measurable real- or complex-valued functions defined on 
 
 
 
 . If  is finite, then the pointwise products of 
 
 
 
 
   with 
 
 
 
  and its complex conjugate function are 
 
 
 
 -integrable, the estimate



and the similar one for 
 
 
 
  hold, and Hölder's inequality can be applied to the right-hand side. In particular, if 
 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
  are in the Hilbert space , then Hölder's inequality for 
 
 
 
  implies



where the angle brackets refer to the inner product of . This is also called Cauchy–Schwarz inequality, but requires for its statement that  and  are finite to make sure that the inner product of 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
 
  is well defined. We may recover the original inequality (for the case 
 
 
 
 ) by using the functions 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  in place of 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
 
 .
Generalization for probability measures
If 
 
 
 
  is a probability space, then 
 
 

 
  just need to satisfy 
 
 
 
 , rather than being Hölder conjugates. A combination of Hölder's inequality and Jensen's inequality implies that



for all measurable real- or complex-valued functions 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 ,
Notable special cases
For the following cases assume that 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 
  are in the open interval 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
 .
Counting measure
For the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional Euclidean space, when the set 
 
 
 
  is 
 
 
 
 
  with the counting measure, we have



If 
 
 
 
  with the counting measure, then we get Hölder's inequality for sequence spaces:



Lebesgue measure
If 
 
 
 
  is a measurable subset of  with the Lebesgue measure, and 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
  are measurable real- or complex-valued functions on 
 
 
 
 , then Hölder inequality is



Probability measure
For the probability space

 
 , let 
 
 
 
  denote the expectation operator. For real- or complex-valued random variables

 
  and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 , Hölder's inequality reads



Let 
 
 




In particular, if the 
 
 
th absolute moment is finite, then the 
 
 
 th absolute moment is finite, too. (This also follows from Jensen's inequality.)
Product measure
For two σ-finite measure spaces  and  define the product measure space by



where 
 
 
 
  is the Cartesian product of  and , the  arises as product σ-algebra of  and , and 
 
 
 
  denotes the product measure of  and . Then Tonelli's theorem allows us to rewrite Hölder's inequality using iterated integrals: If 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
  are  real- or complex-valued functions on the Cartesian product 
 
 
 
 , then



This can be generalized to more than two  measure spaces.
Vector-valued functions
Let 
 
 
 
  denote a  measure space and suppose that  (f1, ..., fn)}} and  (g1, ..., gn)}} are 
 
 
 
 -measurable functions on 
 
 
 
 , taking values in the 
 
 
 
 -dimensional real- or complex Euclidean space. By taking the product with the counting measure on 
 
 
 
 , we can rewrite the above product measure version of Hölder's inequality in the form



If the two integrals on the right-hand side are finite, then equality holds if and only if there exist real numbers 
 
 
 
 , not both of them zero, such that



for 
 
 
 
 -almost all 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 .
This finite-dimensional version generalizes to functions 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
  taking values in a sequence space.
Proof of Hölder's inequality
There are several proofs of Hölder's inequality; the main idea in the following is Young's inequality.
If  0}}, then 
 
 
 
   is zero 
 
 
 
 -almost everywhere, and the product 
 
 
 
  is zero 
 
 
 
 -almost everywhere, hence the left-hand side of Hölder's inequality is zero. The same is true if  0}}. Therefore, we may assume  and  in the following.
If  ∞}} or  ∞}}, then the right-hand side of Hölder's inequality is infinite. Therefore, we may assume that  and  are in 
 
 
 
 .
If 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , then  almost everywhere and Hölder's inequality follows from the monotonicity of the Lebesgue integral. Similarly for 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, we may also assume 
 
 

 
 .
Dividing 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
  by  and , respectively, we can assume that



We now use Young's inequality, which states that



for all nonnegative 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
 , where equality is achieved if and only if  bq}}. Hence



Integrating both sides gives



which proves the claim.
Under the assumptions 
 
 

 
  and  q}}, equality holds if and only if  q}} almost everywhere. More generally, if  and  are in 
 
 
 
 , then Hölder's inequality becomes an equality if and only if there exist real numbers 
 
 
 
 , namely



such that


 
    μ-almost everywhere   (*).
The case  0}} corresponds to 
 
 
 
  in (*). The case  0}} corresponds to 
 
 
 
  in (*).


Alternate (simpler) proof using Jensen's inequality


Recall the Jensen's inequality for the convex function 
 
 
 
  (it is convex because obviously 
 
 
 
 ):



where 
 
 
 
  is any probability distribution and 
 
 
 
  any 
 
 
 
 -measurable function. Let 
 
 
 
  be any measure, and 
 
 
 
  the distribution whose density w.r.t. 
 
 
 
  is proportional to 
 
 
 
 , i.e.



Hence we have, using 
 
 
 
 , hence 
 
 
 
 , and letting 
 
 
 
 ,



Finally, we get



This assumes 
 
 
 
  real and non negative, but the extension to complex functions is straightforward (use the modulus of 
 
 
 
 ). It also assumes that 
 
 
 
  are neither null nor infinity, and that 
 
 
 
 : all these assumptions can also be lifted as in the proof above.


Extremal equality
Statement
Assume that 
 
 




where max indicates that there actually is a 
 
 
 
  maximizing the right-hand side. When 
 
 
 
  and if each set 
 
 
 
  in the  
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  contains a subset 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 






Proof of the extremal equality


By Hölder's inequality, the integrals are well defined and, for 
 
 
 
 ,



hence the left-hand side is always bounded above by the right-hand side.
Conversely, for 
 
 
 
 , observe first that the statement is obvious when  0}}. Therefore, we assume  in the following.
If 
 
 




By checking the cases 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 




It remains to consider the case 
 
 
 
 . For 
 
 

 
  define



Since 
 
 
 
   is measurable, 
 
 
 
 . By the definition of  as the essential supremum of 
 
 
 
   and the assumption , we have 
 
 
 
 . Using the additional assumption on the  
 
 
 
  if necessary, there exists a subset 
 
 
 
  of 
 
 
 
  with 
 
 




Then 
 
 
 
  is well-defined, measurable and 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , hence . Furthermore,





Remarks and examples

The equality for 
 
 
 
  fails whenever there exists a set 
 
 
 
  in the  
 
 
 
  with 
 
 
 
  that has no subset

 
  with 
 
 

For 
 
 
 
 , the supremum is in general not attained. As an example, let 
 
 
 
  denote the natural numbers (without zero), 
 
 
 
  the power set of 
 
 
 
 , and 
 
 
 
  the counting measure. Define 
 
 
 
  for every natural number 
 
 
 
 . Then  1}}. For  with , let 
 
 
 
  denote the smallest natural number with 
 
 
 
 . Then









Applications

The extremal equality is one of the ways for proving the triangle inequality  for all  and  in , see Minkowski inequality.


Hölder's inequality implies that every  defines a bounded (or continuous) linear functional   on  by the formula








The extremal equality (when true) shows that the norm of this functional   as element of the continuous dual space  coincides with the norm of 
 
 
 
   in  (see also the  article).
 

Generalization of Hölder's inequality
Assume that 
 
 

 
  and 

 
  such that



Then, for all measurable real- or complex-valued functions  defined on 
 
 
 
 ,



In particular,



Note: For 
 
 
 
 , contrary to the notation,  is in general not a norm, because it doesn't satisfy the triangle inequality.


Proof of the generalization


We use Hölder's inequality and mathematical induction. For 
 
 
 
 , the result is obvious. Let us now pass from 
 
 
 
 
  to 
 
 
 
 . Without loss of generality assume that .
Case 1: If  ∞}}, then



Pulling out the essential supremum of  and using the induction hypothesis, we get



Case 2: If , then



are Hölder conjugates in 
 
 
 
 . Application of Hölder's inequality gives



Raising to the power 
 
 
 
  and rewriting,



Since  pn}} and



the claimed inequality now follows by using the induction hypothesis.


Interpolation
Let 

 
 
  and let  denote weights with  1}}. Define 
 
 
 
  as the weighted harmonic mean, i.e.,



Given a measurable real- or complex-valued function 
 
 
 
   on 
 
 
 
 , define



Then by the above generalization of Hölder's inequality,



In particular, taking  θ}} and  1 − θ}}, in the case 
 
 
 
 , we obtain the interpolation result (Littlewood's inequality)



for 
 
 

 
 
  and



A similar application of Hölder gives Lyapunov's inequality: If 
 
 
 
  for 
 
 
 
 , then



Both Littlewood and Lyapunov imply that if 
 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 

If  and , then the reverse Hölder inequality is an equality if and only if there exists an 
 
 
 
  such that


 
     
 
 
 
 -almost everywhere.
Note:  and  are not norms, these expressions are just compact notations for


 
    and   
 
 



Proof of the reverse Hölder inequality


Note that 
 
 
 
  and



are Hölder conjugates. Application of Hölder's inequality gives



Raising to the power 
 
 
 
 , rewriting and solving for  gives the reverse Hölder inequality.
Since 
 
 
 
  is not almost everywhere equal to the zero function, we can have equality if and only if there exists a constant 
 
 
 
  such that  α −q/p}} almost everywhere. Solving for the absolute value of 
 
 
 
   gives the claim.


Conditional Hölder inequality
Let 
 
 
 
  be a probability space, 
 
 
 
  a , and 
 
 

 
  Hölder conjugates, meaning that 
 
 
 
 . Then, for all real- or complex-valued random variables 
 
 
 
  and 
 
 
 
  on 
 
 
 
 ,



Remarks:

If a non-negative random variable 
 
 
 
  has infinite expected value, then its conditional expectation is defined by










On the right-hand side of the conditional Hölder inequality, 0 times ∞ as well as ∞ times 0 means 0. Multiplying 
 
 
 
  with ∞ gives ∞.



Proof of the conditional Hölder inequality


Define the random variables



and note that they are measurable with respect to the . Since



it follows that 
 
 
 
  a.s. on the set 
 
 
 
 . Similarly, 
 
 
 
  a.s. on the set 
 
 
 
 , hence



and the conditional Hölder inequality holds on this set. On the set



the right-hand side is infinite and the conditional Hölder inequality holds, too. Dividing by the right-hand side, it therefore remains to show that



Using the measurability of  with respect to the , the rules for conditional expectations, Hölder's inequality and 
 
 
 
 , we see that





Hölder's inequality for increasing seminorms
Let 
 
 
 
  be a set and let 
 
 
 
  be the space of all complex-valued functions on 
 
 
 
 . Let 
 
 
 
  be an increasing seminorm on 
 
 
 
 , meaning that, for all real-valued functions 
 
 
 
   and 
 
 
 
  in 
 
 
 
 , if 
 
 
 
  for all 
 
 
 
 , then 
 
 
 
 . The seminorm is also allowed to attain the value ∞. Then, for all $p , q ∈$ $( 1, ∞ )$ with $1/ p + 1/ q = 1$, which means that they are conjugate Hölder exponents, and for all complex-valued functions $f , g ∈ F ( S , \mathbf{ C } )$,1
$$N(|fg|) \le \bigl(N(|f|^p)\bigr)^{\frac{1}{p}} \bigl(N(|g|^q)\bigr)^{\frac{1}{q}}.$$
Remark: If $( S , Σ, μ )$ is a measure space and $N ( f )$ is the upper Lebesgue integral of the absolute value $| f |$, then the restriction of $N$ to all  functions gives the usual version of Hölder's inequality.
