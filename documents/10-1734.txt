   3-ketovalidoxylamine C-N-lyase      3-ketovalidoxylamine C-N-lyase   In enzymology , a 3-ketovalidoxylamine C-N-lyase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   4-nitrophenyl-3-ketovalidamine   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   4-nitroaniline + 5-D-(5/6)-5-C-(hydroxymethyl)-2,6-dihydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one   Hence, this enzyme has one substrate , 4-nitrophenyl-3-ketovalidamine , and two products , 4-nitroaniline and 5-D-(5/6)-5-C-(hydroxymethyl)-2,6-dihydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one .  This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases , specifically amine lyases, which cleave carbon-nitrogen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is 4-nitrophenyl-3-ketovalidamine 4-nitroaniline-lyase [5-D-(5/6)-5-C-(hydroxymethyl)-2,6-dihydroxycyclohex-2-en-1-one-form ing] . Other names in common use include 3-ketovalidoxylamine A C-N-lyase , p-nitrophenyl-3-ketovalidamine p-nitroaniline lyase , and 4-nitrophenyl-3-ketovalidamine 4-nitroaniline-lyase . It employs one cofactor , calcium .  References      "  Category:EC 4.3.3  Category:Calcium enzymes  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
