   2,3-diaminopropionate N-oxalyltransferase      2,3-diaminopropionate N-oxalyltransferase   In enzymology , a 2,3-diaminopropionate N-oxalyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   oxalyl-CoA + L-2,3-diaminopropanoate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   CoA + N 3 -oxalyl-L-2,3-diaminopropanoate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are oxalyl-CoA and L-2,3-diaminopropanoate , whereas its two products are CoA and N3-oxalyl-L-2,3-diaminopropanoate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is oxalyl-CoA:L-2,3-diaminopropanoate N3-oxalyltransferase . Other names in common use include oxalyldiaminopropionate synthase , ODAP synthase , oxalyl-CoA:L-alpha,beta-diaminopropionic acid oxalyltransferase , oxalyldiaminopropionic synthase , and oxalyl-CoA:L-2,3-diaminopropanoate 3-N-oxalyltransferase .
