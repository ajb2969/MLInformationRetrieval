   Pendulum (mathematics)      Pendulum (mathematics)   The mathematics of pendulums are in general quite complicated. Simplifying assumptions can be made, which in the case of a simple pendulum allows the equations of motion to be solved analytically for small-angle oscillations.  Simple gravity pendulum  (Figure)  Animation of a pendulum showing the velocity and acceleration vectors .   A so-called "simple pendulum" is an idealization of a "real pendulum" but in an isolated system using the following assumptions:   The rod or cord on which the bob swings is massless, inextensible and always remains taut;  The bob is a point mass;  Motion occurs only in two dimensions , i.e. the bob does not trace an ellipse but an arc .  The motion does not lose energy to friction or air resistance .   The differential equation which represents the motion of a simple pendulum is  where   g   g   g   is acceleration due to gravity,   ℓ   normal-ℓ   \ell   is the length of the pendulum, and   θ   θ   \theta   is the angular displacement.      {{show   "Force" derivation of ()    Consider Figure 1 on the right, which shows the forces acting on a simple pendulum. Note that the path of the pendulum sweeps out an arc of a circle. The angle   θ   θ   \theta   is measured in radians , and this is crucial for this formula. The blue arrow is the gravitational force acting on the bob, and the violet arrows are that same force resolved into components parallel and perpendicular to the bob's instantaneous motion. The direction of the bob's instantaneous velocity always points along the red axis, which is considered the tangential axis because its direction is always tangent to the circle. Consider Newton's second law,      F  =   m   a        F    m  a     F=ma\,   where F is the sum of forces on the object, m is mass, and a is the acceleration. Because we are only concerned with changes in speed, and because the bob is forced to stay in a circular path, we apply Newton's equation to the tangential axis only. The short violet arrow represents the component of the gravitational force in the tangential axis, and trigonometry can be used to determine its magnitude. Thus,      F  =   -   m  g   sin  θ     =   m   a          F      m  g    θ            m  a      F=-mg\sin\theta=ma\,         a  =   -   g   sin   θ          a      g    θ       a=-g\sin\theta\,   where     g   g   g   is the acceleration due to gravity near the surface of the earth. The negative sign on the right hand side implies that   θ   θ   \theta   and   a   a   a   always point in opposite directions. This makes sense because when a pendulum swings further to the left, we would expect it to accelerate back toward the right. This linear acceleration   a   a   a   along the red axis can be related to the change in angle   θ   θ   \theta   by the arc length formulas;   s   s   s   is arc length:      s  =   ℓ   θ        s    normal-ℓ  θ     s=\ell\theta\,         v  =    d  s    d  t    =   ℓ    d  θ    d  t           v      d  s     d  t           normal-ℓ      d  θ     d  t        v={ds\over dt}=\ell{d\theta\over dt}         a  =     d  2   s    d   t  2     =   ℓ     d  2   θ    d   t  2            a       superscript  d  2   s     d   superscript  t  2            normal-ℓ       superscript  d  2   θ     d   superscript  t  2         a={d^{2}s\over dt^{2}}=\ell{d^{2}\theta\over dt^{2}}   thus:       ℓ     d  2   θ    d   t  2      =   -   g   sin  θ           normal-ℓ       superscript  d  2   θ     d   superscript  t  2          g    θ       \ell{d^{2}\theta\over dt^{2}}=-g\sin\theta             d  2   θ    d   t  2     +    g  ℓ    sin  θ     =  0             superscript  d  2   θ     d   superscript  t  2         g  normal-ℓ     θ     0    {d^{2}\theta\over dt^{2}}+{g\over\ell}\sin\theta=0   }}         {{show   "Torque" derivation of ()   Equation (1) can be obtained using two definitions for torque.      τ  =   𝐫  ×  𝐅   =    d  𝐋    d  t          τ    𝐫  𝐅            d  𝐋     d  t       \mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{r}\times\mathbf{F}={{d\mathbf{L}}\over{dt}}   First start by defining the torque on the pendulum bob using the force due to gravity.       τ  =   𝐥  ×   𝐅  𝐠     ,      τ    𝐥   subscript  𝐅  𝐠      \mathbf{\tau}=\mathbf{l\times F_{g}},   where   𝐥   𝐥   \mathbf{l}   is the length vector of the pendulum and    𝐅  𝐠     subscript  𝐅  𝐠    \mathbf{F_{g}}   is the force due to gravity.

However adding a restriction to the size of the oscillation's amplitude gives a form whose solution can be easily obtained. If it is assumed that the angle is much less than 1 radian, or      θ  ≪   1      much-less-than  θ  1    \theta\ll 1\,   ,  then substituting for sin θ into  using the small-angle approximation ,       sin  θ   ≈   θ         θ   θ    \sin\theta\approx\theta\,   ,  yields the equation for a harmonic oscillator ,          d  2   θ    d   t  2     +    g  ℓ   θ    =  0.             superscript  d  2   θ     d   superscript  t  2         g  normal-ℓ   θ    0.    {d^{2}\theta\over dt^{2}}+{g\over\ell}\theta=0.     The error due to the approximation is of order θ 3 (from the Maclaurin series for sin θ ).  Given the initial conditions θ (0) = θ 0 and dθ / dt (0) = 0, the solution becomes,         θ   (  t  )    =    θ  0    cos   (      g   ℓ      t   )        θ  0   ≪  1.      formulae-sequence      θ  t      subscript  θ  0           g  normal-ℓ    t       much-less-than   subscript  θ  0   1.     \theta(t)=\theta_{0}\cos\left(\sqrt{g\over\ell\,}\,t\right)\quad\quad\quad%
 \quad\theta_{0}\ll 1.      The motion is simple harmonic motion where θ 0 is the semi-amplitude of the oscillation (that is, the maximum angle between the rod of the pendulum and the vertical). The period of the motion, the time for a complete oscillation (outward and return) is         T  0   =   2  π    ℓ  g        θ  0   ≪  1      formulae-sequence     subscript  T  0     2  π      normal-ℓ  g       much-less-than   subscript  θ  0   1     T_{0}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{\ell}{g}}\quad\quad\quad\quad\quad\theta_{0}\ll 1      which is known as Christiaan Huygens 's law for the period. Note that under the small-angle approximation, the period is independent of the amplitude θ 0 ; this is the property of isochronism that Galileo discovered.  Rule of thumb for pendulum length       T  0   =   2  π    ℓ  g          subscript  T  0     2  π      normal-ℓ  g       T_{0}=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{\ell}{g}}   can be expressed as     ℓ  =    g   π  2    ×    T  0  2   4     .      normal-ℓ      g   superscript  π  2       superscript   subscript  T  0   2   4      \ell={\frac{g}{\pi^{2}}}\times{\frac{T_{0}^{2}}{4}}.     If SI units are used (i.e. measure in metres and seconds), and assuming the measurement is taking place on the Earth's surface, then    g  ≈  9.81      g  9.81    g\approx 9.81   m/s 2 , and     g  /   π  2    ≈  1        g   superscript  π  2    1    g/\pi^{2}\approx{1}   (0.994 is the approximation to 3 decimal places).  Therefore a relatively reasonable approximation for the length and period are,       ℓ  ≈    T  0  2   4    ,      normal-ℓ     superscript   subscript  T  0   2   4     \ell\approx{\frac{T_{0}^{2}}{4}},          T  0   ≈   2   ℓ         subscript  T  0     2    normal-ℓ      T_{0}\approx 2\sqrt{\ell}     Arbitrary-amplitude period  For amplitudes beyond the small angle approximation , one can compute the exact period by first inverting the equation for the angular velocity obtained from the energy method (),  (Figure)  Figure 3.

(Conversely, a pendulum close to its maximum can take an arbitrarily long time to fall down.)

For comparison of the approximation to the full solution, consider the period of a pendulum of length 1 m on Earth ( g = 9.80665 m/s 2 ) at initial angle 10 degrees is     4      1   m   g    K   (   sin    10  ∘   2    )    ≈    2.0102   s         4        1  normal-m   g    K       superscript  10    2       2.0102  normal-s     4\sqrt{1\ \mathrm{m}\over g}K\left({\sin{10^{\circ}\over 2}}\right)\approx 2.0%

The difference between the two values, less than 0.2%, is much less than that caused by the variation of g with geographical location.

Arithmetic-geometric mean solution for elliptic integral  Given  and the Arithmetic-geometric mean solution of the elliptic integral:        K   (  k  )    =    π  /  2    M   (   1  -  k   ,   1  +  k   )      ,        K  k       π  2     M     1  k     1  k        K(k)=\frac{\pi/2}{M(1-k,1+k)},   where    M   (  x  ,  y  )       M   x  y     M(x,y)   is the arithmetic-geometric mean of   x   x   x   and   y   y   y   .

File:Pendulum_190deg.gif|Pendulum with just barely enough energy for a full swing File:Pendulum_220deg.gif|Pendulum with enough energy for a full swing  Compound pendulum  A compound pendulum (or physical pendulum ) is one where the rod is not massless, and may have extended size; that is, an arbitrarily shaped rigid body swinging by a pivot. In this case the pendulum's period depends on its moment of inertia  I around the pivot point.  The equation of torque gives:      τ  =   I   α        τ    I  α     \tau=I\alpha\,     where:     α   α   \alpha   is the angular acceleration.     τ   τ   \tau   is the torque  The torque is generated by gravity so:      τ  =   -   m  g  L   sin   θ          τ      m  g  L    θ       \tau=-mgL\sin\theta\,     where:   L is the distance from the pivot to the center of mass of the pendulum  θ is the angle from the vertical   Hence, under the small-angle approximation     sin  θ   ≈   θ         θ   θ    \scriptstyle\sin\theta\approx\theta\,   ,      α  ≈   -    m  g  L  θ   I        α        m  g  L  θ   I      \alpha\approx-\frac{mgL\theta}{I}     This is of the same form as the conventional simple pendulum and this gives a period of:      T  =   2  π    I   m  g  L          T    2  π      I    m  g  L        T=2\pi\sqrt{\frac{I}{mgL}}    4  And a frequency of:      f  =   1  T   =    1   2  π       m  g  L   I           f    1  T            1    2  π          m  g  L   I        f=\frac{1}{T}=\frac{1}{2\pi}\sqrt{\frac{mgL}{I}}     Physical interpretation of the imaginary period  The Jacobian elliptic function that expresses the position of a pendulum as a function of time is a doubly periodic function with a real period and an imaginary period. The real period is of course the time it takes the pendulum to go through one full cycle. Paul Appell pointed out a physical interpretation of the imaginary period: 5 if θ 0 is the maximum angle of one pendulum and 180° − θ 0 is the maximum angle of another, then the real period of each is the magnitude of the imaginary period of the other. This interpretation, involving dual forces in opposite directions, might be further clarified and generalized to other classical problems in mechanics with dual solutions. 6  See also   Blackburn pendulum  Conical pendulum  Double pendulum  Inverted pendulum  Kapitza's pendulum  Spring pendulum  Mathieu function  Pendulum equations (software)   References  Further reading       External links   Mathworld article on Mathieu Function  [ http://www.fxsolver.com/solve/share/zbnIQwEdLAZUMx9se7sFrw ==/ Pendulum calculator]   "  Category:Horology  Category:Mathematical physics  Category:Pendulums     ↩  ↩  ↩  Physical Pendulum ↩  Paul Appell, "Sur une interprétation des valeurs imaginaires du temps en Mécanique", Comptes Rendus Hebdomadaires des Scéances de l'Académie des Sciences , volume 87, number 1, July, 1878 ↩  Adlaj, S.
