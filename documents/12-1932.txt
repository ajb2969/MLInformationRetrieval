   Nasalance      Nasalance   Nasalance is a measure of the degree of velopharyngeal opening in voiced speech 1 formed by computing the ratio of the amplitude of the acoustic energy at the nares, A n , to amplitude of the acoustic energy at the mouth, A m . The term nasalance usually refers to this ratio as a percentage:        A  n    (    A  m   +   A  n    )         subscript  A  n      subscript  A  m    subscript  A  n      \dfrac{A_{n}}{(A_{m}+A_{n})}     and thus may be more properly expressed as Percent Nasalance. The term originated in the work of Fletcher and his associates 2 3 and is now implemented in a number of commercially available devices ( lingWAVES™ Nasality , Kay-PENTAX Nasometer and Glottal Enterprises NVS System ). There are small differences in the manner in which nasalance is computed in various devices, and differences 4 in the manner in which the oral and nasal acoustic energies are separated physically, as by a hard separator plate held against the upper lip vs. a two-chamber pneumotachograph mask. However, there have been no conclusive studies of the effect of these differences on a relevant underlying physical variable, such as the area of the velopharyngeal opening.
