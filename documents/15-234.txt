   Rademacher system      Rademacher system   In mathematics, in particular in functional analysis , the Rademacher system , named after Hans Rademacher , is an incomplete orthogonal system of functions on the unit interval of the following form:       {    t  ‚Ü¶    r  n    (  t  )    =   sgn   (   sin    2   n  +  1    œÄ  t    )     ;    t  ‚àà   [  0  ,  1  ]    ,   n  ‚àà  ùí©     }   .      formulae-sequence     maps-to  t     subscript  r  n   t         sgn       superscript  2    n  1    œÄ  t        formulae-sequence    t   0  1      n  ùí©       \{t\mapsto r_{n}(t)=\operatorname{sgn}(\sin 2^{n+1}\pi t);t\in[0,1],n\in%
 \mathcal{N}\}.     The Rademacher system is stochastically-independent, and is closely related to the Walsh system. Specifically, the Walsh system can be constructed as a product of Rademacher functions.  References      "  Category:Functional analysis
