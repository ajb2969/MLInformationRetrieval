CDP-acylglycerol O-arachidonoyltransferase




CDP-acylglycerol O-arachidonoyltransferase

In enzymology, a CDP-acylglycerol O-arachidonoyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

arachidonoyl-CoA + CDP-acylglycerol 
 
 
 
  CoA + CDP-diacylglycerol
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are arachidonoyl-CoA and CDP-acylglycerol, whereas its two products are CoA and CDP-diacylglycerol.
This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those acyltransferases transferring groups other than aminoacyl groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is arachidonoyl-CoA:CDP-acylglycerol O-arachidonoyltransferase. Other names in common use include CDP-acylglycerol O-arachidonyltransferase, and arachidonyl-CoA:CDP-acylglycerol O-arachidonyltransferase. This enzyme participates in glycerophospholipid metabolism.
