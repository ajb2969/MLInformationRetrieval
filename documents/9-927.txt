   Sturm–Picone comparison theorem      Sturm–Picone comparison theorem   In mathematics , in the field of ordinary differential equations , the Sturm–Picone comparison theorem , named after Jacques Charles François Sturm and Mauro Picone , is a classical theorem which provides criteria for the oscillation and non-oscillation of solutions of certain linear differential equations in the real domain.  Let      p  i   ,   q  i    ,      subscript  p  i    subscript  q  i     p_{i},\,q_{i},\,    i = 1, 2, be real-valued continuous functions on the interval [ a , b ] and let          (    p  1    (  x  )    y  ′    )   ′   +    q  1    (  x  )   y    =   0          superscript     subscript  p  1   x   superscript  y  normal-′    normal-′      subscript  q  1   x  y    0    (p_{1}(x)y^{\prime})^{\prime}+q_{1}(x)y=0\,            (    p  2    (  x  )    y  ′    )   ′   +    q  2    (  x  )   y    =   0          superscript     subscript  p  2   x   superscript  y  normal-′    normal-′      subscript  q  2   x  y    0    (p_{2}(x)y^{\prime})^{\prime}+q_{2}(x)y=0\,      be two homogeneous linear second order differential equations in self-adjoint form with      0  <    p  2    (  x  )    ≤    p  1    (  x  )          0     subscript  p  2   x           subscript  p  1   x      0   and         q  1    (  x  )    ≤    q  2    (  x  )     .         subscript  q  1   x      subscript  q  2   x     q_{1}(x)\leq q_{2}(x).\,     Let u be a non-trivial solution of (1) with successive roots at z 1 and z 2 and let v be a non-trivial solution of (2). Then one of the following properties holds.   There exists an x in [ z 1 , z 2 ] such that v ( x ) = 0; or  there exists a λ in R such that v ( x ) = λ u ( x ).   NOTE: The first part of the conclusion is due to Sturm (1836). 1 The second (alternative) part of this theorem is due to Picone (1910) 2 3 whose simple proof was given using his now famous Picone identity . In the special case where both equations are identical one obtains the Sturm separation theorem . For an extension of this important theorem to a comparison theorem involving three or more real second order equations see the Hartman–Mingarelli comparison theorem where a simple proof was given using the Mingarelli identity .
