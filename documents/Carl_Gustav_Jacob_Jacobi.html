<h1>Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi</h1>
<hr/>

<p><strong>Carl Gustav Jacob Jacobi</strong> (;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> ; 10 December 1804 – 18 February 1851) was a <a href="Germans" title="wikilink">German</a> <a class="uri" href="mathematician" title="wikilink">mathematician</a>, who made fundamental contributions to <a href="elliptic_function" title="wikilink">elliptic functions</a>, <a href="Dynamics_(mechanics)" title="wikilink">dynamics</a>, <a href="differential_equation" title="wikilink">differential equations</a>, and <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>. His name is occasionally written as <strong>Carolus Gustavus Iacobus Iacobi</strong> in his <a class="uri" href="Latin" title="wikilink">Latin</a> books, and his first name is sometimes given as Karl.</p>

<p>Jacobi was the first Jewish mathematician to be appointed professor at a German university.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="biography">Biography</h2>

<p>Jacobi was born of <a href="Ashkenazi_Jew" title="wikilink">Ashkenazi Jewish</a> parentage in <a class="uri" href="Potsdam" title="wikilink">Potsdam</a> on 10 December 1804. He was the second of the four children of banker Simon Jacobi, out of which his elder brother <a href="Moritz_von_Jacobi" title="wikilink">Moritz von Jacobi</a> would also become known later as an engineer and physicist. He was initially home schooled by his uncle Lehman, who instructed him in the classical languages and elements of mathematics. In 1816, the twelve-year-old Jacobi went to the Potsdam <a href="Gymnasium_(Germany)" title="wikilink">Gymnasium</a>, where students were being taught classical languages, German history as well as mathematics. As a result of the good education received from his uncle, as well as his own remarkable abilities, after less than half a year Jacobi was moved to the senior year despite his young age. However, as the University was not accepting students younger than 16 years old, he had to remain in the senior class until 1821. He used this time to advance his knowledge, showing interest in all subjects, including Latin and Greek, philology, history and mathematics. During this period he also made the first attempts at research trying to solve the <a href="quintic_equation" title="wikilink">quintic equation</a> by <a href="Algebraic_solution" title="wikilink">radicals</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1821 Jacobi went to study at the <a href="Berlin_University" title="wikilink">Berlin University</a>, where initially he divided his attention between his passions for <a class="uri" href="philology" title="wikilink">philology</a> and <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a>. In <a class="uri" href="philology" title="wikilink">philology</a> he participated in the seminars of <a href="Philipp_August_Böckh" title="wikilink">Böckh</a>, drawing the professor's attention with his talent. Jacobi did not follow a lot of mathematics classes at the University, as the low level of mathematics in Germany at the time rendered them too elementary for him. However, he continued with his private study of the more advanced works of <a class="uri" href="Euler" title="wikilink">Euler</a>, <a class="uri" href="Lagrange" title="wikilink">Lagrange</a> and <a class="uri" href="Laplace" title="wikilink">Laplace</a>. By 1823 he understood that he needed to make a decision between his competing interests and he chose to devote all his attention to mathematics.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> In the same year he became qualified to teach secondary school and was offered a position at the Joachimsthal Gymnasium in Berlin. Jacobi decided instead to continue to work towards a University position. In 1825 he obtained the degree of Doctor of Philosophy with a dissertation on the <a href="partial_fraction_decomposition" title="wikilink">partial fraction decomposition</a> of <a href="rational_fraction" title="wikilink">rational fractions</a> defended before a commission lead by . He followed immediately with his <a class="uri" href="Habilitation" title="wikilink">Habilitation</a> and at the same time converted to Christianity. Now qualifying for teaching University classes, the 21 year old Jacobi lectured in 1825/26 on the theory of <a href="Differential_geometry_of_curves" title="wikilink">curves</a> and <a href="Differential_geometry_of_surfaces" title="wikilink">surfaces</a> at the University of Berlin.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a></p>

<p>In 1827 he became a professor and in 1829, a tenured professor of <a class="uri" href="mathematics" title="wikilink">mathematics</a> at <a href="Königsberg_University" title="wikilink">Königsberg University</a>, and held the chair until 1842.</p>

<p>Jacobi suffered a <a href="Mental_breakdown" title="wikilink">breakdown</a> from overwork in 1843. He then visited <a class="uri" href="Italy" title="wikilink">Italy</a> for a few months to regain his health. On his return he moved to Berlin, where he lived as a royal pensioner until his death. During the <a href="Revolution_of_1848" title="wikilink">Revolution of 1848</a> Jacobi was politically involved and unsuccessfully presented his parliamentary candidature on behalf of a <a href="Liberalism" title="wikilink">Liberal</a> club. This led, after the suppression of the revolution, to his royal grant being cut off – but his fame and reputation were such that it was soon resumed. In 1836, he had been elected a foreign member of the <a href="Royal_Swedish_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences</a>.</p>

<p>Jacobi died in 1851 from a <a class="uri" href="smallpox" title="wikilink">smallpox</a> infection. His grave is preserved at a cemetery in the <a class="uri" href="Kreuzberg" title="wikilink">Kreuzberg</a> section of Berlin, the <a href="Holy_Trinity_Church_(Berlin)#Cemeteries" title="wikilink">Friedhof I der Dreifaltigkeits-Kirchengemeinde</a> (61 Baruther Street). His grave is close to that of <a href="Johann_Encke" title="wikilink">Johann Encke</a>, the astronomer. The crater <a href="Jacobi_(crater)" title="wikilink">Jacobi</a> on the <a class="uri" href="Moon" title="wikilink">Moon</a> is named after him.</p>
<h2 id="scientific-contributions">Scientific contributions</h2>

<p>One of Jacobi's greatest accomplishments was his theory of <a href="elliptic_function" title="wikilink">elliptic functions</a> and their relation to the elliptic <a href="theta_function" title="wikilink">theta function</a>. This was developed in his great treatise <em><a href="Fundamenta_nova_theoriae_functionum_ellipticarum" title="wikilink">Fundamenta nova theoriae functionum ellipticarum</a></em> (1829), and in later papers in <a href="Crelle's_Journal" title="wikilink">Crelle's Journal</a>. Theta functions are of great importance in mathematical physics because of their role in the inverse problem for periodic and quasi-periodic flows. The <a href="equations_of_motion" title="wikilink">equations of motion</a> are <a href="Jacobi_integral" title="wikilink">integrable</a> in terms of <a href="Jacobi's_elliptic_functions" title="wikilink">Jacobi's elliptic functions</a> in the well-known cases of the <a class="uri" href="pendulum" title="wikilink">pendulum</a>, the Euler top, the symmetric <a class="uri" href="Lagrange" title="wikilink">Lagrange</a> top in a <a href="gravitational_field" title="wikilink">gravitational field</a> and the Kepler problem (planetary motion in a central gravitational field).</p>

<p>He also made fundamental contributions in the study of differential equations and to <a href="rational_mechanics" title="wikilink">rational mechanics</a>, notably the <a href="Hamilton–Jacobi_equation" title="wikilink">Hamilton–Jacobi theory</a>.</p>

<p>It was in algebraic development that Jacobi’s peculiar power mainly lay, and he made important contributions of this kind to many areas of mathematics, as shown by his long list of papers in Crelle’s Journal and elsewhere from 1826 onwards. One of his maxims was: 'Invert, always invert' ('man muss immer umkehren'), expressing his belief that the solution of many hard problems can be clarified by re-expressing them in inverse form.</p>

<p>In his 1835 paper, Jacobi proved the following basic result classifying periodic (including elliptic) functions: ''If a univariate single-valued function is multiply <a href="periodic_function" title="wikilink">periodic</a>, then such a function cannot have more than two periods, and the <a href="ratio_of_the_period" title="wikilink">ratio of the periods</a> cannot be a <a href="real_number" title="wikilink">real number</a>. '' He discovered many of the fundamental properties of theta functions, including the functional equation and the <a href="Jacobi_triple_product" title="wikilink">Jacobi triple product</a> formula, as well as many other results on <a class="uri" href="q-series" title="wikilink">q-series</a> and <a href="hypergeometric_series" title="wikilink">hypergeometric series</a>.</p>

<p>The solution of the <strong>Jacobi inversion problem</strong> for the hyperelliptic Abel map by <a class="uri" href="Weierstrass" title="wikilink">Weierstrass</a> in 1854 required the introduction of the hyperelliptic theta function and later the general Riemann theta function for algebraic curves of arbitrary genus. The complex torus associated to a genus

This method of inversion, and its subsequent extension by <a class="uri" href="Weierstrass" title="wikilink">Weierstrass</a> and <a class="uri" href="Riemann" title="wikilink">Riemann</a> to arbitrary algebraic curves, may be seen as a higher genus generalization of the relation between elliptic integrals and the Jacobi, or Weierstrass elliptic functions</p>

<p>Jacobi was the first to apply elliptic functions to <a href="number_theory" title="wikilink">number theory</a>, for example proving of <a href="Pierre_de_Fermat" title="wikilink">Fermat's</a> <a href="Fermat's_theorem_on_sums_of_two_squares" title="wikilink">two-square theorem</a> and <a href="Lagrange" title="wikilink">Lagrange's</a> <a href="Lagrange's_four-square_theorem" title="wikilink">four-square theorem</a>, and similar results for 6 and 8 squares. His other work in number theory continued the work of <a href="Karl_Gauss" title="wikilink">C. F. Gauss</a>: new proofs of <a href="quadratic_reciprocity" title="wikilink">quadratic reciprocity</a> and introduction of the <a href="Jacobi_symbol" title="wikilink">Jacobi symbol</a>; contributions to higher reciprocity laws, investigations of <a href="continued_fractions" title="wikilink">continued fractions</a>, and the invention of <a href="Jacobi_sum" title="wikilink">Jacobi sums</a>.</p>

<p>He was also one of the early founders of the theory of determinants; in particular, he invented the <a href="Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant" title="wikilink">Jacobian determinant</a> formed from the <em>n</em>² differential coefficients of <em>n</em> given functions of <em>n</em> independent variables, and which has played an important part in many analytical investigations. In 1841 he reintroduced the <a href="partial_derivative" title="wikilink">partial derivative</a> ∂ notation of <a href="Adrien-Marie_Legendre" title="wikilink">Legendre</a>, which was to become standard.</p>

<p>Students of <a href="Vector_(geometry)" title="wikilink">vector fields</a> and <a href="Lie_algebra" title="wikilink">Lie theory</a> often encounter the <a href="Jacobi_identity" title="wikilink">Jacobi identity</a>, the analog of associativity for the <a href="Lie_bracket_of_vector_fields" title="wikilink">Lie bracket</a> operation.</p>

<p><a href="Planetary_theory" title="wikilink">Planetary theory</a> and other particular dynamical problems likewise occupied his attention from time to time. While contributing to <a href="celestial_mechanics" title="wikilink">celestial mechanics</a>, he introduced the <a href="Jacobi_integral" title="wikilink">Jacobi integral</a> (1836) for a <a href="sidereal_coordinate_system" title="wikilink">sidereal coordinate system</a>. His theory of the <em>last multiplier</em> is treated in <em>Vorlesungen über Dynamik</em>, edited by <a href="Alfred_Clebsch" title="wikilink">Alfred Clebsch</a> (1866).</p>

<p>He left many manuscripts, portions of which have been published at intervals in Crelle's Journal. His other works include <em>Commentatio de transformatione integralis duplicis indefiniti in formam simpliciorem</em> (1832), <em><a href="Canon_arithmeticus" title="wikilink">Canon arithmeticus</a></em> (1839), and <em>Opuscula mathematica</em> (1846–1857). His <em>Gesammelte Werke</em> (1881–1891) were published by the <a href="Prussian_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Berlin Academy</a>.</p>
