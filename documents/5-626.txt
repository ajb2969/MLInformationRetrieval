Null vector

 In mathematics, a null vector, or isotropic vector, is an element x of a real vector space X with an associated quadratic form q, i.e. a pseudo-Euclidean space , for which .
A pseudo-Euclidean space may be decomposed (non-uniquely) into subspaces A and B, , where q is positive-definite on A and negative-definite on B. The null cone, or isotropic cone, of X consists of the union of balanced spheres:



In the theory of bilinear forms, definite quadratic forms and isotropic quadratic forms are distinct. They are distinguished in that only for the latter there exists a nonzero null vector. In this context, a null vector is termed an isotropic vector.
Examples
The light-like vectors of Minkowski space are null vectors.
The four linearly independent biquaternions l = 1 + hi, n = 1 + hj, m = 1 + hk, and m* = 1 – hk are null vectors and { l, n, m, m* } can serve as a basis for the subspace used to represent spacetime. Null vectors are also used in the Newman-Penrose formalism approach to spacetime manifolds.1
In the Verma module of a Lie algebra there are null vectors.
