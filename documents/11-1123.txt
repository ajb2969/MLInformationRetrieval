   Valine—pyruvate transaminase      Valine—pyruvate transaminase   In enzymology , a valine-pyruvate transaminase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   L-valine + pyruvate   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate + L-alanine   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are L-valine and pyruvate , whereas its two products are 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate and L-alanine .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically the transaminases , which transfer nitrogenous groups. The systematic name of this enzyme class is L-valine:pyruvate aminotransferase . Other names in common use include transaminase C , valine-pyruvate aminotransferase , and alanine-oxoisovalerate aminotransferase . This enzyme participates in valine, leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis .  References      "  Category:EC 2.6.1  Category:Enzymes of unknown structure
