Inositol-hexakisphosphate kinase

Inositol-hexakisphosphate kinase (, ATP:1D-myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate phosphotransferase) is an enzyme with system name ATP:1D-myo-inositol-hexakisphosphate 5-phosphotransferase.123 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

(1) ATP + 1D-myo-inositol hexakisphosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 1D-myo-inositol 5-diphosphate 1,2,3,4,6-pentakisphosphate
 
(2) ATP + 1D-myo-inositol 1,3,4,5,6-pentakisphosphate 
 
 
 
  ADP + 1D-myo-inositol diphosphate tetrakisphosphate (isomeric configuration unknown)
 

Three mammalian isoforms are known to exist.
