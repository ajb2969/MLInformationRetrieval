Rhodopsin kinase (, cone opsin kinase, G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 1, GPCR kinase 1, GRK1, GRK7, opsin kinase, opsin kinase (phosphorylating), rhodopsin kinase (phosphorylating), RK, STK14) is a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase involved in phototransduction.12345678 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction
