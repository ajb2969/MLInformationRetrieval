Lactate—malate transhydrogenase

In enzymology, a lactate—malate transhydrogenase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

(S)-lactate + oxaloacetate 
 
 
 
  pyruvate + malate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are (S)-lactate and oxaloacetate, whereas its two products are pyruvate and malate.
This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases, specifically those acting on the CH-OH group of donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is (S)-lactate:oxaloacetate oxidoreductase. This enzyme is also called malate-lactate transhydrogenase. This enzyme participates in pyruvate metabolism. It employs one cofactor, nicotinamide D-ribonucleotide.
