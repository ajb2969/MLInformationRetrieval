Steroid 15beta-monooxygenase

Steroid 15beta-monooxygenase (, cytochrome P-450meg, cytochrome P450meg, steroid 15beta-hydroxylase, CYP106A2, BmCYP106A2) is an enzyme with system name ''progesterone,reduced-ferredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (15beta-hydroxylating) ''.12345 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction

progesterone + reduced ferredoxin + O2

 
  15beta-hydroxyprogesterone + oxidized ferredoxin + H2O
 

The enzyme from Bacillus megaterium hydroxylates a variety of 3-oxo-Delta4-steroids in position 15beta.
