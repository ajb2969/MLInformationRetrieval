   Steroid 15beta-monooxygenase      Steroid 15beta-monooxygenase   Steroid 15beta-monooxygenase (, cytochrome P-450meg , cytochrome P450meg , steroid 15beta-hydroxylase , CYP106A2 , BmCYP106A2 ) is an enzyme with system name ''progesterone,reduced-ferredoxin:oxygen oxidoreductase (15beta-hydroxylating) ''. 1 2 3 4 5 This enzyme catalyses the following chemical reaction   progesterone + reduced ferredoxin + O 2    ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   15beta-hydroxyprogesterone + oxidized ferredoxin + H 2 O   The enzyme from Bacillus megaterium hydroxylates a variety of 3-oxo-Delta4-steroids in position 15beta.
