   Einthoven's triangle      Einthoven's triangle    Einthoven's triangle is an imaginary formation of three limb leads in a triangle used in electrocardiography , formed by the two shoulders and the pubis. 1 The shape forms an inverted equilateral triangle with the heart at the center that produces zero potential when the voltages are summed. It is named after Willem Einthoven , who theorized its existence. 2  Lead placements   Lead I – This axis goes from shoulder to shoulder, with the negative electrode placed on the right shoulder and the positive electrode placed on the left shoulder.   $$I = LA - RA$$   Lead II – This axis goes from the right arm to the left leg, with the negative electrode on the shoulder and the positive one on the leg.   $$II = LL - RA$$   Lead III - This axis goes from the left shoulder (negative electrode) to the left leg (positive electrode).   $$III = LL - LA$$  References  "  Category:Cardiac electrophysiology  Category:Dutch inventions     ↩  ↩
