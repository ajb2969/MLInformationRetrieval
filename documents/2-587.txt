   Wiener equation      Wiener equation   A simple mathematical representation of Brownian motion , the Wiener equation , named after Norbert Wiener , assumes the current velocity of a fluid particle fluctuates randomly :       𝐯  =    d  𝐱    d  t    =   g   (  t  )     ,        𝐯      d  𝐱     d  t           g  t      \mathbf{v}=\frac{d\mathbf{x}}{dt}=g(t),     where v is velocity , x is position, d/dt is the time derivative , and g(t) may for instance be white noise .  Since velocity changes instantly in this formalism, the Wiener equation is not suitable for short time scales. In those cases, the Langevin equation , which looks at particle acceleration , must be used.  "  Category:Stochastic differential equations
