   Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation      Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation   RENO (Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillations) is a short baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiment in South Korea . The experiment was designed to either measure or set a limit on the neutrino mixing matrix parameter θ 13 , a parameter responsible for oscillations of electron neutrinos into other neutrino flavours. RENO has two identical detectors, placed at distances of 294 m and 1383 m, that observe electron antineutrinos produced by six reactors at the Hanbit Nuclear Power Plant (the old name: the Yeonggwang Nuclear Power Plant) in Korea.  On 3 April 2012, with some corrections on 8 April, the RENO collaboration announced a 4.9σ observation of θ 13 ≠ 0, with       sin  2   2   θ  13   =  0.113  ±  0.013   (  stat  .  )   ±  0.019   (  syst  .  )      fragments   superscript   2   2   subscript  θ  13    0.113  plus-or-minus  0.013   fragments  normal-(  stat  normal-.  normal-)   plus-or-minus  0.019   fragments  normal-(  syst  normal-.  normal-)     \sin^{2}2\theta_{13}=0.113\pm 0.013({\rm stat.})\pm 0.019({\rm syst.})    1 2  This measurement confirmed a similar result announced by the Daya Bay Experiment three weeks before and is consistent with earlier, but less significant results by T2K , MINOS and Double Chooz .  RENO released updated results 3 in December 2013:       sin  2   2   θ  13   =  0.100  ±  0.010   (  stat  .  )   ±  0.015   (  syst  .  )      fragments   superscript   2   2   subscript  θ  13    0.100  plus-or-minus  0.010   fragments  normal-(  stat  normal-.  normal-)   plus-or-minus  0.015   fragments  normal-(  syst  normal-.  normal-)     \sin^{2}2\theta_{13}=0.100\pm 0.010({\rm stat.})\pm 0.015({\rm syst.})     References  "  Category:Neutrino experiments  Category:Reactor neutrino experiments     ↩  ↩  ↩
