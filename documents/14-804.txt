Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillation

RENO (Reactor Experiment for Neutrino Oscillations) is a short baseline reactor neutrino oscillation experiment in South Korea. The experiment was designed to either measure or set a limit on the neutrino mixing matrix parameter θ13, a parameter responsible for oscillations of electron neutrinos into other neutrino flavours. RENO has two identical detectors, placed at distances of 294 m and 1383 m, that observe electron antineutrinos produced by six reactors at the Hanbit Nuclear Power Plant (the old name: the Yeonggwang Nuclear Power Plant) in Korea.
On 3 April 2012, with some corrections on 8 April, the RENO collaboration announced a 4.9σ observation of θ13 ≠ 0, with

This measurement confirmed a similar result announced by the Daya Bay Experiment three weeks before and is consistent with earlier, but less significant results by T2K, MINOS and Double Chooz.
RENO released updated results3 in December 2013:
