   Law of total probability      Law of total probability   In probability theory , the law (or formula ) of total probability is a fundamental rule relating marginal probabilities to conditional probabilities . It expresses the total probability of an outcome which can be realized via several distinct events - hence the name.  Statement  The law of total probability is 1 the proposition that if    {   B  n   :   n  =   1  ,  2  ,  3  ,  …    }     conditional-set   subscript  B  n     n   1  2  3  normal-…      \left\{{B_{n}:n=1,2,3,\ldots}\right\}   is a finite or countably infinite  partition of a sample space (in other words, a set of pairwise disjoint  events whose union is the entire sample space) and each event    B  n     subscript  B  n    B_{n}   is measurable , then for any event   A   A   A   of the same probability space :       Pr   (  A  )    =    ∑  n    Pr   (   A  ∩   B  n    )          Pr  A     subscript   n    Pr    A   subscript  B  n        \Pr(A)=\sum_{n}\Pr(A\cap B_{n})\,     or, alternatively, 2        Pr   (  A  )    =    ∑  n     Pr   (  A  ∣   B  n   )     Pr   (   B  n   )       ,       Pr  A     subscript   n      Pr  A   subscript  B  n     Pr   subscript  B  n        \Pr(A)=\sum_{n}\Pr(A\mid B_{n})\Pr(B_{n}),\,     where, for any    n    n   n\,   for which     Pr   (   B  n   )    =   0        Pr   subscript  B  n    0    \Pr(B_{n})=0\,   these terms are simply omitted from the summation, because    Pr   (  A  ∣   B  n   )      Pr  A   subscript  B  n     \Pr(A\mid B_{n})\,   is finite.  The summation can be interpreted as a weighted average , and consequently the marginal probability,    Pr   (  A  )      Pr  A    \Pr(A)   , is sometimes called "average probability"; 3 "overall probability" is sometimes used in less formal writings. 4  The law of total probability can also be stated for conditional probabilities. Taking the    B  n     subscript  B  n    B_{n}   as above, and assuming   C   C   C   is an event independent with any of the    B  n     subscript  B  n    B_{n}   :       Pr   (  A  ∣  C  )    =    ∑  n     Pr   (  A  ∣   C  ∩   B  n    )     Pr   (   B  n   ∣  C  )      =    ∑  n     Pr   (  A  ∣   C  ∩   B  n    )     Pr   (   B  n   )             Pr  A  C     subscript   n      Pr  A    C   subscript  B  n      Pr   subscript  B  n   C            subscript   n      Pr  A    C   subscript  B  n      Pr   subscript  B  n         \Pr(A\mid C)=\sum_{n}\Pr(A\mid C\cap B_{n})\Pr(B_{n}\mid C)=\sum_{n}\Pr(A\mid C%
 \cap B_{n})\Pr(B_{n})     Informal formulation  The above mathematical statement might be interpreted as follows: given an outcome   A   A   A   , with known conditional probabilities given any of the    B  n     subscript  B  n    B_{n}   events, each with a known probability itself, what is the total probability that   A   A   A   will happen? . The answer to this question is given by    Pr   (  A  )      Pr  A    \Pr(A)   .  Example  Suppose that two factories supply light bulbs to the market. Factory X 's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 99% of cases, whereas factory Y 's bulbs work for over 5000 hours in 95% of cases. It is known that factory X supplies 60% of the total bulbs available. What is the chance that a purchased bulb will work for longer than 5000 hours?  Applying the law of total probability, we have:       Pr   (  A  )    =     Pr   (  A  |   B  1   )    ⋅   Pr   (   B  1   )     +    Pr   (  A  |   B  2   )    ⋅   Pr   (   B  2   )      =     99  100   ⋅   6  10    +    95  100   ⋅   4  10     =    594  +  380   1000   =   974  1000          Pr  A      normal-⋅   Pr  A   subscript  B  1     Pr   subscript  B  1      normal-⋅   Pr  A   subscript  B  2     Pr   subscript  B  2              normal-⋅    99  100     6  10     normal-⋅    95  100     4  10              594  380   1000          974  1000      {\Pr(A)=\Pr(A|B_{1})}\cdot{\Pr(B_{1})}+{\Pr(A|B_{2})}\cdot{\Pr(B_{2})}={99%
 \over 100}\cdot{6\over 10}+{95\over 100}\cdot{4\over 10}={{594+380}\over 1000}%
 ={974\over 1000}     where        Pr   (   B  1   )    =   6  10        Pr   subscript  B  1      6  10     \Pr(B_{1})={6\over 10}   is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory X ;       Pr   (   B  2   )    =   4  10        Pr   subscript  B  2      4  10     \Pr(B_{2})={4\over 10}   is the probability that the purchased bulb was manufactured by factory Y ;       Pr   (  A  |   B  1   )    =   99  100        Pr  A   subscript  B  1      99  100     \Pr(A|B_{1})={99\over 100}   is the probability that a bulb manufactured by X will work for over 5000 hours;       Pr   (  A  |   B  2   )    =   95  100        Pr  A   subscript  B  2      95  100     \Pr(A|B_{2})={95\over 100}   is the probability that a bulb manufactured by Y will work for over 5000 hours.   Thus each purchased light bulb has a 97.4% chance to work for more than 5000 hours.  Applications  One common application of the law is where the events coincide with a discrete random variable  X taking each value in its range, i.e.    B  n     subscript  B  n    B_{n}   is the event    X  =   x  n       X   subscript  x  n     X=x_{n}   . It follows that the probability of an event A is equal to the expected value of the conditional probabilities of A given    X  =   x  n       X   subscript  x  n     X=x_{n}   . That is,        Pr   (  A  )    =    ∑  n     Pr   (  A  ∣   X  =   x  n    )     Pr   (   X  =   x  n    )      =   E   [   Pr   (  A  ∣  X  )    ]     ,         Pr  A     subscript   n      Pr  A    X   subscript  x  n      Pr    X   subscript  x  n             normal-E   Pr  A  X       \Pr(A)=\sum_{n}\Pr(A\mid X=x_{n})\Pr(X=x_{n})=\operatorname{E}[\Pr(A\mid X)],     where Pr( A | X ) is the conditional probability of A given the value of the random variable X . 5 This conditional probability is a random variable in its own right, whose value depends on that of X . The conditional probability Pr( A | X = x) is simply a conditional probability given an event, [ X = x ]. It is a function of x , say g ( x ) = Pr( A | X = x ). Then the conditional probability Pr( A | X ) is g ( X ), hence itself a random variable. This version of the law of total probability says that the expected value of this random variable is the same as Pr( A ).  This result can be generalized to continuous random variables (via continuous conditional density ), and the expression becomes        Pr   (  A  )    =   E   [   Pr   (  A  ∣   ℱ  X   )    ]     ,       Pr  A    normal-E   Pr  A   subscript  ℱ  X       \Pr(A)=\operatorname{E}[\Pr(A\mid\mathcal{F}_{X})],     where    ℱ  X     subscript  ℱ  X    \mathcal{F}_{X}   denotes the sigma-algebra generated by the random variable X .  Other names  The term law of total probability is sometimes taken to mean the law of alternatives , which is a special case of the law of total probability applying to discrete random variables . One author even uses the terminology "continuous law of alternatives" in the continuous case. 6 This result is given by Grimmett and Welsh 7 as the partition theorem , a name that they also give to the related law of total expectation .
