   All one polynomial      All one polynomial   An all one polynomial (AOP) is a polynomial in which all coefficients are one. Over the finite field of order two , conditions for the AOP to be irreducible are known, which allow this polynomial to be used to define efficient algorithms and circuits for multiplication in finite fields of characteristic two. 1 The AOP is a 1- equally spaced polynomial . 2  Definition  An AOP of degree m has all terms from x m to x 0 with coefficients of 1, and can be written as       A  O   P  m    (  x  )    =    ∑   i  =  0   m    x  i          A  O   subscript  P  m   x     superscript   subscript     i  0    m    superscript  x  i      AOP_{m}(x)=\sum_{i=0}^{m}x^{i}     or       A  O   P  m    (  x  )    =    x  m   +   x   m  -  1    +  ⋯  +  x  +  1         A  O   subscript  P  m   x      superscript  x  m    superscript  x    m  1    normal-⋯  x  1     AOP_{m}(x)=x^{m}+x^{m-1}+\cdots+x+1     or       A  O   P  m    (  x  )    =     x   m  +  1    -  1    x  -  1          A  O   subscript  P  m   x        superscript  x    m  1    1     x  1      AOP_{m}(x)={x^{m+1}-1\over{x-1}}     thus the roots of the all one polynomial of degree m are all (m+1)th roots of unity other than unity itself.  Properties  Over GF(2) the AOP has many interesting properties, including:   The Hamming weight of the AOP is m + 1, the maximum possible for its degree 3  The AOP is irreducible if and only if m + 1 is prime and 2 is a primitive root modulo m + 1 4  The only AOP that is a primitive polynomial is x 2 + x + 1.   Despite the fact that the Hamming weight is large, because of the ease of representation and other improvements there are efficient implementations in areas such as coding theory and cryptography . 5  Over   ℚ   ℚ   \mathbb{Q}   , the AOP is irreducible whenever m + 1 is prime p, and therefore in these cases, the p th cyclotomic polynomial . 6  References  External links     "  Category:Field theory  Category:Polynomials     . ↩  . ↩  . ↩    . ↩
