   Traditional Balsamic Vinegar      Traditional Balsamic Vinegar   Traditional Balsamic Vinegar (or Aceto Balsamico Tradizionale ) is a costly type of balsamic vinegar produced in the Emilia Romagna region of Italy . Unlike inexpensive "Balsamic Vinegar of Modena" (BVM), Traditional Balsamic Vinegar (TBV) is produced from cooked grape must , aged at least 12 years, and is protected under the European Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) system. 1 (BVM has lesser protection under the European Protected Geographical Indication (PGI) system. 2 ) Although the names are similar, TBV and the inexpensive imitation BVM are very different. 3 [[Image:Barrels vinegar.jpg|thumb|right|   Barrels during aging]]  History  A comprehensive study about the original making procedure, the aging conditions, and the sensory profile is not available. This and the few and often-confusing documents make the reconstruction of the true history of TBV a challenge. The first generally accepted document referring to a precious vinegar produced in the area of Modena and Reggio Emilia is the poem written in the 12th century by the monk Donizo of Canossa, 4 although the word "balsamic" is never mentioned. The first testimonies clearly speaking about "balsamic vinegar", as well as of recipes and making procedure appear from the 19th century even if little is known about the original recipes and related making practices. 5 The adjective "balsamic" has been used to designate any kind of generically aromatic vinegar and products not just obtained from the fermentation of grape must alone. 6 As far as the aging method is concerned, it is very similar to the Solera system used in Spain after Napoleonic Wars, spreading abroad after the second half of the 19th century. 7  (Figure)  The two Italian traditional balsamic vinegars (from Modena and Reggio Emilia) with Protected Denomination of Origin, in their legally approved shaped bottles   Legal aspects  TBV is produced in two different geographical areas of the Emilia Romagna Region so that two different designations were granted by the European Council, i.e. Traditional Balsamic Vinegar of Modena (TBVM) and Traditional Balsamico Vinegar of Reggio Emilia (TBVRE). The two special vinegars are very similar products as the overall making procedure is the same; but, under a legal point of view, they are obtained according to specific and official production regulations 8 9 defining (1) the basis of the vineyards ampelographic; (2) geographical area of production; (3) characteristics of starting materials; (4) making procedure; (5) the chemical, physical and sensorial requirements for sale; (6) bottling, labelling and presentation. The sensory profile of TBV is evaluated by hedonic judgment expressed through a numeric score. The sensory score achieved is used to rank TBV in different commercial classes. The specific regulations allow adding "Extra Vecchio" to the official designation when the product is aged for 25 years at least. However, under existing regulations, neither the definition of "aging" nor the methods for its objective evaluation are specified; it is evaluated only through panel-tasting tests, whose effectiveness for this purpose is clearly inadequate. 10 TBV results as a blend of vinegars of different composition and age due to the traditional making procedure. Actually, an easy-to-use mathematical method for evaluating the actual residence time of TBV within each cask of the barrel set has been recently published. 11 This method is an adequate tool helping aging certification. An easy-to-use spreadsheet of the theoretical model is available for download 12  here . At present, however, independent agencies that officially state TBV authenticity of both the TBVM and TBVRE haven't adopted it or any analogous procedure as an evaluation system.  Basic technology  Making process of the TBV starts from freshly squeezed grape juice and finishes with sensory evaluation of the aged vinegar. From a technological perspective, basic steps are required, including cooking of the grape must, alcoholic fermentation by yeasts, acetic oxidation by acetic acid bacteria, and slow aging within a barrel set.  Cooking of the grape must  Cooking of the grape juice is carried out in open vessels directly heated by fire for 12 – 24 hours reducing the grape juice by about 50%. The production regulations require starting from a grape must with 15 °Bx at least to reach at the end of cooking 30°Bx for TBVRE; for TBVM, the lower limit is not specified. It is possible to find cooked musts with sugar concentration beyond 50°Bx. 13 The operation allows profound chemical and physical modifications affecting the end quality of TBV. Cooking stops all enzymatic browning reactions that rapidly occur inside fresh grape musts by polyphenol oxidase and progressively promotes grape must discoloration due to the heat-induced deactivation of proteins including browning enzymes. In addition, cooking promotes nonenzymatic browning chemical reactions involving sugar conversion, formation of high molecular weight melanoidins 14 and furanic compounds such as 5-hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF). 15 Water vaporization induces the concentration of sugars, organic acids, and polyphenols concentration, resulting in the increase of density, viscosity, and refractive index (Brix degree), and, conversely, the lowering of water activity and pH value.  Alcoholic fermentation  Sugar fermentation and ethanol oxidation occur as a two-step biological transformation of the cooked must. The first requires anaerobic conditions and the second aerobic conditions. The two biological conversions occur inside a dedicated vessel, called the'' badessa''. The alcoholic fermentation is carried out by yeasts belonging to a plethora of species and genera. 16 In the past, the idea of a commensalistic interaction between yeasts and acetic acid bacteria existed, but recently the scalar fermentation has been suggested. 17 The alcoholic fermentation is widely accepted to affect the end quality of TBV due to the several yeasts' metabolisms involved. 18  Acetic bioxidation  In TBV, the oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid in fermented cooked must is carried out by indigenous acetic acid bacteria naturally occurred in the environment. However, the application of selected acetic acid bacteria strains in TBV production has been recently proposed, and a procedure has been developed for the scale-up of the fermentation process at the vinegar factory scale. 19 Bacteria involved in alcoholic dehydrogenation produce a wide range of compounds other than acetic acid, such as sugar acids and many volatile compounds. So, the chemical composition of TBV, relating to the AAB oxidation products, is highly variable and depends on several factors such as the type of grape must, cooking modality, oxidation temperature, and others. The acetification process and the growth of relevant bacteria are mainly affected by the alcohol, sugar, and acetic acid content. 20  Aging  The aging is related to two basic concepts. 21 The first concerns the time that vinegar spends inside the barrel set (age or residence time); the second accounts for all time-dependent changes in chemical, physical and sensorial properties (physical ripening time).  The barrel set  The barrel set is a series of at least five wooden casks arranged according to a decreasing size scale, where the product undergoes profound changes over the time. Casks may be of different wood types, i.e. oak, mulberry, ash, chestnut, cherry, juniper, and acacia, and the smallest cask volume ranges from 15 to 25 liters. Each cask has a hole on the top, the so-called cocchiume , facilitating the usual inspection and maintenance activities. The barrel set behaves essentially as a device for vinegar concentration due to the water loss through the staves. As widely known for the wine production, it is reasonable to suppose that the wood acts as a semipermeable filter for the transfer of small molecules towards the ambient while it retains important volatile compounds such as the acetic acid. However, when the opening is not hermetically closed, the volatile compounds are lost preferentially through the cocchiume itself. 22  (Figure)  A possible configuration of the barrel set   Refilling procedure  The making procedure of TBV is a semicontinuous process requiring the annual refilling activity, consisting of withdrawing only a part of the vinegar from the smallest cask and topping it with the vinegar coming from the next cask along with the barrel set, and so on. The biggest cask receives new cooked and acetified must. This refilling procedure resembles the Solera method used for making sherry wine. The purpose of refilling in the TBV making is to keep the vinegar volume constant inside every casks in the barrel set, and compensate for the volume drop caused by these three factors: TBV withdrawn for bottling, water evaporation, and possible vinegar leakages from the staves. Refilling involves the product flux-splitting from the biggest to the smallest cask, leading to the solute dislocation along the barrel set.  Age and yield  Each cask of a barrel set contains a blend of vinegars with different compositions and ages due to the refilling procedure. As a consequence, the mean age of vinegar can be calculated as the weighted residence time of the different aliquots of vinegars introduced throughout years. A theoretical model has been recently developed to estimate the mean age of TBV requiring refilling, withdrawn, and casks volumes as input data. 23 The refilling procedure imposes an upper limit for the residence time of the vinegar inside the barrel set. The yield of a barrel set used for TBV production is easy to calculate by the ratio between the amount of TBV withdrawn (mTBV) and the amount of cooked must (mREFILLING) used to refill the biggest cask:       Y  i  e  l  d   =    m  T  B  V    m  R  E  F  I  L  L  I  N  G          Y  i  e  l  d       m  T  B  V     m  R  E  F  I  L  L  I  N  G      Yield=\frac{mTBV}{mREFILLING}     Yield indicates the ability of a barrel set to concentrate cooked must at given operating conditions being dependent on the rate of water loss by evaporation. Low yields are due both to relatively low withdrawn and high water evaporation rates. The latter is the major factor lowering the TBV yield. The bigger is the evaporation rate, the higher is the flux of material through the barrel set and the lower is the residence time. 24 25 As a consequence, when the yield is low, the vinegar age might be relatively low as a function of the amount of cooked must used to refill. 26 Applying the spreadsheet of the theoretical model 27 to a barrel set as in figure, the residence time obtained as a function of withdrawn quantity and evaporation rate is plotted in the concerning graph.  Chemical composition      TBV composition     Major compounds     Soluble solids     Glucose     Fructose     Tartaric acid     Succinic acid     Acetic acid     Malic acid     Gluconic acid     Lactic acid     Volatile compounds     Alcohols     Aldehydes     Acids     Acetates     Esters     Enolic derivatives     Furanic compounds     Ketones     Lactones     Phenols     Terpenes     Antioxidant molecules     Phenolic acids     Flavanols     Flavonols     Tannins     Major compound data from 28     Volatile compounds data from 29       The composition of TBV is very complex and not yet fully described. The classes of the major components are the sugars 30 (mainly glucose and fructose) and organic acids 31 (mainly acetic, gluconic, malic, tartaric, succinic acids). The classes of the minor compounds refer to volatile compounds 32 and antioxidant molecules 33 mainly polyphenols. 34 An important class of minor compounds, recently investigated, is that known as melanoidins, an heterogeneous mixture of polymers arising from sugar degradation reactions activated during cooking of the grape must. These polymers contribute to many physical properties of TBV including colligative ones, the refractive index, density, specific heat capacity melt, and rheological properties. 35  Physical properties  The most relevant physical properties of the TBV are:   pH is usually lower than 3, it is a measure of the extent of carboxylic acids dissociation.  Density is usually intended as mass density at 20°C, it cannot be lower than 1.24 g/ml (TBVM) 36 and 1.20 g/ml (TBVRE); 37 it is a measure of the extent of the solute concentration, as well as of water evaporation.  Refractive index is usually expressed with Brix scale and reaches on average 73°Bx.  Color ranges from yellow/brown to brown/black during aging because of the accumulation of compounds, mainly melanoidins, from nonenzymatic reactions such as acid-catalyzed sugar degradation and Maillard reactions. 38  Viscosity is a macroscopic measure of the degree of intermolecular interaction inside the vinegar bulk and is easily determined as the resistance to flow under controlled experimental conditions. The viscosity of TBV is on average around 0.56Pa⋅s 39 and determines the TBV fluency as visually assessed according to procedures in use to assign sensory judgements.  Flow index indicates the deviation of the flowing properties from the linearity (Newtonian behavior). 40   TBV compared to BVM and other balsamic products  Under a legal point of view, TBV is categorized as 'food condiment', while BVM is a 'wine vinegar'. BVM can be produced without an aging period, whereas TBV gains its peculiar features during a long aging period fixed by law at no less than 12 years. TBV is the only condiment in the world produced starting from cooked grape musts without the adding of other substances, 41 whereas BVM is a blend of concentrated grape musts, wine vinegars, and caramel (optional).

Not required: Higher density values are possible as a function of recipes.     Minimum of total acidity   TBVM 4.5g/100g - TBVRE 5g/100g of acetic acid equivalent, the acetic acid is biologically produced in the early stages of making procedure, then it concentrates during aging.   6g/100g of acetic acid equivalent. The acetic acid comes from the starting ingredients.   Not required     Colour   Dark brown, limpid and bright, color is determined by nonenzymatic browning reaction of sugars starting on grape must cooking stage and progressing during aging.   Dark brown, limpid and bright, brown colour can be enhanced by added caramel (E150d)   Dark brown, limpid and bright, brown colour can be enhanced by added caramel (E150d)     Viscosity   The viscosity of TBV is mainly affected by the amount of the high molecular weight melanoidin, a heterogeneous class of biopolymers that form and accumulate during the ageing process. 43   Viscosity is lower than TBV ones, although it can be enhanced by adding caramel.   The flow properties are very similar to the TBV ones, but they originate from the adding of thickeners.     Sensory evaluation   It is a prerequisite for their commercialization. Sensory panels are long-time, trained judges, but sensory procedures are not standardized, often leading to irreproducible scores. 44   Not required   Not required       References  External links   [ http://www.dipsaa.unimore.it/ita/index.php?option=com_content&task; ;=view&id;=51&Itemid;=22 Vinegar Research Team of the Department of Agricultural and Food Sciences - University of Modena and Reggio Emilia (Italy)]  Vinegars and Acetic Acid Bacteria 2005 International Symposium   "   Category:Italian cuisine  Category:Salad dressings  Category:Reggio Emilia  Category:Modena  Category:Vinegar  Category:Italian products with protected designation of origin     EC Council Regulation No. 813/2000 ↩  EC Council Regulation No. 583/2009 ↩  Giudici, P.; M.
