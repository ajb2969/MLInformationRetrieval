<h1>Skyscraper</h1>
<hr/>
<p> A <strong>skyscraper</strong> is a tall, continuously habitable building of over 14 <a href="Storey" title="wikilink">floors</a>, mostly designed for office, commercial and residential uses. A skyscraper can also be called a <a href="Tower_block" title="wikilink">high-rise</a>, but the term skyscraper is often used for buildings higher than . For buildings above a height of , the term <em>Supertall</em> can be used, while skyscrapers reaching beyond  are classified as <em>megatall</em>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn1" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework that supports <a href="curtain_wall_(architecture)" title="wikilink">curtain walls</a>. These curtain walls either bear on the framework below or are suspended from the framework above, rather than <a href="load-bearing_wall" title="wikilink">load-bearing walls</a> of conventional construction. Some early skyscrapers have a <a href="steel_frame" title="wikilink">steel frame</a> that enables the construction of load-bearing walls taller than of those made of <a href="reinforced_concrete" title="wikilink">reinforced concrete</a>. Modern skyscrapers' walls are not load-bearing and most skyscrapers are characterized by large surface areas of windows made possible by the concept of steel frame and curtain walls. However, skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimic conventional walls and a small surface area of windows. Modern skyscrapers often have a <a href="Tube_(structure)" title="wikilink">tubular structure</a>, and are designed to act like a hollow cylinder to resist lateral loads (wind, seismic, etc.). To appear more slender, allow less wind exposure and to transmit more daylight to the ground, many skyscrapers have a design with <a href="Setback_(architecture)" title="wikilink">setbacks</a>.</p>
<h2 id="definition">Definition</h2>
<p>A relatively big building may be considered a skyscraper if it protrudes well above its built environment and changes the overall <a class="uri" href="skyline" title="wikilink">skyline</a>. The maximum height of structures has progressed historically with building methods and technologies and thus what is today considered a skyscraper is taller than before. The <a href="Burj_Khalifa" title="wikilink">Burj Khalifa</a> is currently the tallest building in the world. Skyscrapers conserve space by building up instead of out.</p>
<p><a class="uri" href="High-rise" title="wikilink">High-rise</a> buildings are considered shorter than skyscrapers. There is no clear definition of any difference between a <a href="tower_block" title="wikilink">tower block</a> and a skyscraper though a building lower than about thirty stories is not likely to be a skyscraper and a building with fifty or more stories is certainly a skyscraper.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn2" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a></p>
<p>The term "skyscraper" was first applied to buildings of steel framed construction of at least 10 <a href="storey" title="wikilink">stories</a> in the late 19th century, a result of public amazement at the tall buildings being built in major cities like <a class="uri" href="Chicago" title="wikilink">Chicago</a>, <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, <a class="uri" href="Philadelphia" title="wikilink">Philadelphia</a>, <a class="uri" href="Detroit" title="wikilink">Detroit</a>, and <a href="St._Louis" title="wikilink">St. Louis</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn3" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> The first steel frame skyscraper was the <a href="Home_Insurance_Building" title="wikilink">Home Insurance Building</a> (originally 10 stories with a height of ) in Chicago, Illinois in 1885. Some point to Philadelphia's 10-story <a href="William_L._Johnston" title="wikilink">Jayne Building</a> (1849–50) as a proto-skyscraper, or to New York's seven-floor <a href="Equitable_Life_Assurance_Building" title="wikilink">Equitable Life Assurance Building</a>, built in 1870, for its innovative use of a kind of skeletal frame, but such designation depends largely on what factors are chosen. Even the scholars making the argument find it to be purely academic.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn4" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn5" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a></p>
<p>The structural definition of the word <em>skyscraper</em> was refined later by architectural historians, based on engineering developments of the 1880s that had enabled construction of tall multi-story buildings. This definition was based on the steel skeleton—as opposed to constructions of load-bearing <a class="uri" href="masonry" title="wikilink">masonry</a>, which passed their practical limit in 1891 with Chicago's <a href="Monadnock_Building" title="wikilink">Monadnock Building</a>.</p>

<p>The <a href="Emporis_Standards_Committee" title="wikilink">Emporis Standards Committee</a> defines a <a href="Tower_block" title="wikilink">high-rise</a> building as "a multi-story structure between 35–100 meters tall, or a building of unknown height from 12–39 floors"<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn6" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a> and a skyscraper as "a multi-story building whose architectural height is at least ."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn7" id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a> Some <a href="structural_engineer" title="wikilink">structural engineers</a> define a highrise as any vertical construction for which wind is a more significant <a href="Structural_load" title="wikilink">load factor</a> than <a class="uri" href="earthquake" title="wikilink">earthquake</a> or weight. Note that this criterion fits not only high-rises but some other tall structures, such as <a href="tower" title="wikilink">towers</a>.</p>
<p>The word <em>skyscraper</em> often carries a connotation of pride and achievement. The skyscraper, in name and social function, is a modern expression of the age-old symbol of the <a href="axis_mundi" title="wikilink">world center</a> or <em>axis mundi</em>: a pillar that connects earth to heaven and the four compass directions to one another.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn8" id="fnref8"><sup>8</sup></a></p>

<h2 id="history">History</h2>
<p> </p>
<h3 id="pre-19th-century">Pre-19th century</h3>
<p>Until the 19th century, buildings of over six stories were rare, as having great numbers of stairs to climb was impractical for inhabitants, and <a href="fluid_pressure" title="wikilink">water pressure</a> was usually insufficient to supply running water above .</p>
<p>The tallest building in ancient times was the  <a href="Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" title="wikilink">Great Pyramid of Giza</a> in <a href="ancient_Egypt" title="wikilink">ancient Egypt</a>, built in the 26th century BC. It was not surpassed in height for thousands of years, the 14th century AD <a href="Lincoln_Cathedral" title="wikilink">Lincoln Cathedral</a> being conjectured by many to have exceeded it.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn10" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a> The latter in turn was not surpassed until the  <a href="Washington_Monument" title="wikilink">Washington Monument</a> in 1884. However, being uninhabited, none of these structures actually comply with the modern definition of a skyscraper.</p>
<p>High-rise apartments flourished in <a href="classical_antiquity" title="wikilink">classical antiquity</a>. <a href="Ancient_Rome" title="wikilink">Ancient Roman</a> <a class="uri" href="insulae" title="wikilink">insulae</a> in <a href="Roman_Empire" title="wikilink">imperial</a> cities reached 10 and more stories.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn11" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a> Beginning with <a class="uri" href="Augustus" title="wikilink">Augustus</a> (r. 30 BC-14 AD), several <a href="Roman_emperor" title="wikilink">emperors</a> attempted to establish limits of 20–25 m for multi-story buildings, but met with only limited success.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn12" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn13" id="fnref13"><sup>13</sup></a> Lower floors were typically occupied by shops or wealthy families, the upper rented to the lower classes.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn14" id="fnref14"><sup>14</sup></a> Surviving <a href="Oxyrhynchus_Papyri" title="wikilink">Oxyrhynchus Papyri</a> indicate that seven-story buildings existed in <a href="Roman_province" title="wikilink">provincial</a> towns such as in 3rd century AD <a class="uri" href="Hermopolis" title="wikilink">Hermopolis</a> in <a href="History_of_Roman_Egypt" title="wikilink">Roman Egypt</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn15" id="fnref15"><sup>15</sup></a></p>
<p>The skylines of many important <a href="Middle_Ages" title="wikilink">medieval</a> cities had large numbers of high-rise urban towers, built by the wealthy for defense and status. The residential <a href="Towers_of_Bologna" title="wikilink">Towers</a> of 12th century <a class="uri" href="Bologna" title="wikilink">Bologna</a> numbered between 80 to 100 at a time, the tallest of which is the  high Asinelli Tower. A <a href="Florence" title="wikilink">Florentine</a> law of 1251 decreed that all urban buildings be immediately reduced to less than 26 m.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn16" id="fnref16"><sup>16</sup></a> Even medium-sized towns of the era are known to have proliferations of towers, such as the 72 up to 51 m height in <a href="San_Gimignano" title="wikilink">San Gimignano</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn17" id="fnref17"><sup>17</sup></a></p>
<p>The <a href="History_of_Arab_Egypt" title="wikilink">medieval Egyptian</a> city of <a class="uri" href="Fustat" title="wikilink">Fustat</a> housed many high-rise residential buildings, which <a class="uri" href="Al-Muqaddasi" title="wikilink">Al-Muqaddasi</a> in the 10th century described as resembling <a href="minaret" title="wikilink">minarets</a>. <a href="Nasir_Khusraw" title="wikilink">Nasir Khusraw</a> in the early 11th century described some of them rising up to 14 stories, with <a href="roof_garden" title="wikilink">roof gardens</a> on the top floor complete with ox-drawn <a href="water_wheel" title="wikilink">water wheels</a> for irrigating them.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn18" id="fnref18"><sup>18</sup></a> <a class="uri" href="Cairo" title="wikilink">Cairo</a> in the 16th century had high-rise <a href="apartment_building" title="wikilink">apartment buildings</a> where the two lower floors were for commercial and storage purposes and the multiple stories above them were <a href="Renting" title="wikilink">rented</a> out to <a href="Leasehold_estate" title="wikilink">tenants</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn19" id="fnref19"><sup>19</sup></a> An early example of a city consisting entirely of high-rise housing is the 16th-century city of <a class="uri" href="Shibam" title="wikilink">Shibam</a> in <a class="uri" href="Yemen" title="wikilink">Yemen</a>. Shibam was made up of over 500 tower houses,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn20" id="fnref20"><sup>20</sup></a> each one rising 5 to 11 stories high,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn21" id="fnref21"><sup>21</sup></a> with each floor being an <a class="uri" href="apartment" title="wikilink">apartment</a> occupied by a single family. The city was built in this way in order to protect it from <a class="uri" href="Bedouin" title="wikilink">Bedouin</a> attacks.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn22" id="fnref22"><sup>22</sup></a> Shibam still has the tallest <a class="uri" href="mudbrick" title="wikilink">mudbrick</a> buildings in the world, with many of them over  high.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn23" id="fnref23"><sup>23</sup></a></p>
<p>An early modern example of high-rise housing was in 17th-century <a class="uri" href="Edinburgh" title="wikilink">Edinburgh</a>, Scotland, where a defensive city wall defined the boundaries of the city. Due to the restricted land area available for development, the houses increased in height instead. Buildings of 11 stories were common, and there are records of buildings as high as 14 stories. Many of the stone-built structures can still be seen today in the old town of Edinburgh. The oldest iron framed building in the world, although only partially iron framed, is <a href="Ditherington_Flax_Mill" title="wikilink">The Flaxmill</a> (also locally known as the "Maltings"), in <a class="uri" href="Shrewsbury" title="wikilink">Shrewsbury</a>, England. Built in 1797, it is seen as the "grandfather of skyscrapers”, since its fireproof combination of cast iron columns and cast iron beams developed into the modern steel frame that made modern skyscrapers possible. In 2013 funding was confirmed to convert the derelict building into offices.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn24" id="fnref24"><sup>24</sup></a></p>

<h3 id="early-skyscrapers">Early skyscrapers</h3>
<p><embed src="Bits & Pieces - BP352 - Cameraman films sky scraper - EYE FLM7657 - OB 104841.ogv" title="fig:Cameraman films sky scraper."></embed> In 1852 <a href="Elisha_Otis" title="wikilink">Elisha Otis</a> introduced the safety elevator, allowing convenient and safe passenger movement to upper floors. Another crucial development was the use of a steel frame instead of stone or brick, otherwise the walls on the lower floors on a tall building would be too thick to be practical. An early development in this area was <a href="Oriel_Chambers" title="wikilink">Oriel Chambers</a> in Liverpool. Designed by local architect Peter Ellis in 1864, the building was the world's first iron-framed, glass curtain-walled office building. It was only 5 floors high.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn25" id="fnref25"><sup>25</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn26" id="fnref26"><sup>26</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn27" id="fnref27"><sup>27</sup></a> Further developments led to the world's first skyscraper, the ten-story <a href="Home_Insurance_Building" title="wikilink">Home Insurance Building</a> in Chicago, built in 1884–1885.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn28" id="fnref28"><sup>28</sup></a> While its height is not considered very impressive today, it was at that time. The architect, Major <a href="William_Le_Baron_Jenney" title="wikilink">William Le Baron Jenney</a>, created a load-bearing structural frame. In this building, a steel frame supported the entire weight of the walls, instead of load-bearing walls carrying the weight of the building. This development led to the "Chicago skeleton" form of construction. In addition to the steel frame, the Home Insurance Building also utilized fireproofing, elevators, and electrical wiring, key elements in most skyscrapers today.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn29" id="fnref29"><sup>29</sup></a></p>
<p><a href="Burnham_and_Root" title="wikilink">Burnham and Root</a>'s 1889 <a href="Rand_McNally_Building" title="wikilink">Rand McNally Building</a> in Chicago, 1889, was the first all-steel framed skyscraper,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn30" id="fnref30"><sup>30</sup></a> while <a href="Louis_Sullivan" title="wikilink">Louis Sullivan</a>'s <a href="Wainwright_Building" title="wikilink">Wainwright Building</a> in St. Louis, Missouri, 1891, was the first <a href="steel-framed_building" title="wikilink">steel-framed building</a> with soaring vertical bands to emphasize the height of the building and is therefore considered by some to be the first true skyscraper.</p>
<p>Most early skyscrapers emerged in the land-strapped areas of Chicago and New York City toward the end of the 19th century. A land boom in Melbourne, Australia between 1888–1891 spurred the creation of a significant number of early skyscrapers, though none of these were steel reinforced and few remain today. Height limits and fire restrictions were later introduced. London builders soon found building heights limited due to a complaint from Queen Victoria, rules that continued to exist with few exceptions until the 1950s. Concerns about aesthetics and fire safety had likewise hampered the development of skyscrapers across continental Europe for the first half of the twentieth century. With some notable exceptions, like the 1898 <a href="Witte_Huis" title="wikilink">Witte Huis</a> <em>(White House)</em> in Rotterdam; the <a href="Royal_Liver_Building" title="wikilink">Royal Liver Building</a> in Liverpool, completed in 1911 and  high;<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn31" id="fnref31"><sup>31</sup></a> the 1924 <a href="Wilhelm_Marx_House" title="wikilink">Marx House</a> in Düsseldorf, Germany; the 17-story <a class="uri" href="Kungstornen" title="wikilink">Kungstornen</a> <em>(Kings' Towers)</em> in Stockholm, Sweden, which were built 1924–25,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn32" id="fnref32"><sup>32</sup></a> the 15-story <a href="Edificio_Telefónica" title="wikilink">Edificio Telefónica</a> in Madrid, Spain, built in 1929; the 26-story <a class="uri" href="Boerentoren" title="wikilink">Boerentoren</a> in Antwerp, Belgium, built in 1932; and the 31-story <a href="Terrazza_Martini_Tower" title="wikilink">Torre Piacentini</a> in Genoa, Italy, built in 1940).</p>
<p>After an early competition between Chicago and New York City for the world's tallest building, New York took the lead by 1895 with the completion of the <a href="American_Surety_Building" title="wikilink">American Surety Building</a>, leaving New York with the title of the world's tallest building for many years. New York City developers competed among themselves, with successively taller buildings claiming the title of "world's tallest" in the 1920s and early 1930s, culminating with the completion of the <a href="Chrysler_Building" title="wikilink">Chrysler Building</a> in 1930 and the <a href="Empire_State_Building" title="wikilink">Empire State Building</a> in 1931, the world's tallest building for forty years. The first completed <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a> tower became the world's tallest building in 1972. However, it was soon overtaken by the Sears Tower (now <a href="Willis_Tower" title="wikilink">Willis Tower</a>) in Chicago within two years. The Sears Tower stood as the world's tallest building for 24 years, from 1974 until 1998, until it was edged out by <a href="Petronas_Twin_Towers" title="wikilink">Petronas Twin Towers</a> in Kuala Lumpur, which held the title for six years.</p>
<h3 id="modern-skyscrapers">Modern skyscrapers</h3>
<p> Modern skyscrapers are built with <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> or <a href="reinforced_concrete" title="wikilink">reinforced concrete</a> frameworks and <a href="curtain_wall_(architecture)" title="wikilink">curtain walls</a> of <a class="uri" href="glass" title="wikilink">glass</a> or polished <a class="uri" href="stone" title="wikilink">stone</a>. They use mechanical equipment such as <a href="water_pump" title="wikilink">water pumps</a> and <a href="elevator" title="wikilink">elevators</a>. From the 1930s onwards, skyscrapers began to appear around the world - also in Latin America (such as <a href="São_Paulo" title="wikilink">São Paulo</a>, <a href="Rio_de_Janeiro" title="wikilink">Rio de Janeiro</a>, <a href="Buenos_Aires" title="wikilink">Buenos Aires</a>, <a href="Santiago,_Chile" title="wikilink">Santiago</a>, <a class="uri" href="Lima" title="wikilink">Lima</a>, <a class="uri" href="Caracas" title="wikilink">Caracas</a>, <a class="uri" href="Bogotá" title="wikilink">Bogotá</a>, <a href="Mexico_City" title="wikilink">Mexico City</a>) and in Asia (<a class="uri" href="Tokyo" title="wikilink">Tokyo</a>, <a class="uri" href="Shanghai" title="wikilink">Shanghai</a>, <a href="Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Hong Kong</a>, <a class="uri" href="Manila" title="wikilink">Manila</a>, <a class="uri" href="Singapore" title="wikilink">Singapore</a>, <a class="uri" href="Mumbai" title="wikilink">Mumbai</a>, <a class="uri" href="Seoul" title="wikilink">Seoul</a>, <a href="Kuala_Lumpur" title="wikilink">Kuala Lumpur</a>, <a class="uri" href="Taipei" title="wikilink">Taipei</a>, <a class="uri" href="Bangkok" title="wikilink">Bangkok</a>).</p>
<p>Immediately after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a>, the <a href="Soviet_Union" title="wikilink">Soviet Union</a> planned eight massive skyscrapers, with seven of them actually getting built until 1953, dubbed the "<a href="Seven_Sisters_(Moscow)" title="wikilink">Seven Sisters of Moscow</a>". Other skyscrapers in the style of <a href="Stalinist_architecture" title="wikilink">Socialist Classicism</a> were erected in East Germany (<a href="Frankfurter_Tor" title="wikilink">Frankfurter Tor</a>), Poland (<a href="Palace_of_Culture_and_Science" title="wikilink">PKiN</a>), Ukraine (<a href="Hotel_Ukrayina" title="wikilink">Hotel Ukrayina</a>), Latvia (<a href="Latvian_Academy_of_Sciences" title="wikilink">Academy of Sciences</a>) and other countries. The western countries of Europe also began to permit taller skyscrapers than before WW2, such as <a class="uri" href="Madrid" title="wikilink">Madrid</a> during the 1950s (<a href="Gran_Vía_(Madrid)" title="wikilink">Gran Vía</a>). Finally, skyscrapers also began to be constructed in cities of Africa, the Middle East and Oceania (mainly Australia) from the late 1950s on.</p>
<p>Skyscraper projects after <a href="World_War_II" title="wikilink">World War II</a> typically rejected the classical designs of the <a href="early_skyscrapers" title="wikilink">early skyscrapers</a>, instead embracing the uniform <a href="International_style_(architecture)" title="wikilink">international style</a>; many older skyscrapers were redesigned to suit contemporary tastes or even demolished - such as New York's <a href="Singer_Building" title="wikilink">Singer Building</a>, once the world's tallest skyscraper.</p>
<p><a href="Germany" title="wikilink">German</a> architect <a href="Ludwig_Mies_van_der_Rohe" title="wikilink">Ludwig Mies van der Rohe</a> became one of the world's most renowned architects in the second half of the 20th century. He conceived of the glass façade skyscraper<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn33" id="fnref33"><sup>33</sup></a> and, along with Norwegian <a href="Fred_Severud" title="wikilink">Fred Severud</a>,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn34" id="fnref34"><sup>34</sup></a> he designed the <a href="Seagram_Building" title="wikilink">Seagram Building</a> in 1958, a skyscraper that is often regarded as the pinnacle of the modernist high-rise architecture.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn35" id="fnref35"><sup>35</sup></a></p>
<p>After the <a href="Great_Depression" title="wikilink">Great Depression</a> skyscrapers construction suffered a hiatus for over thirty years due to economic problems. A revival occurred with structural innovations that transformed the industry,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn36" id="fnref36"><sup>36</sup></a> making it possible for people to live and work in "cities in the sky".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn37" id="fnref37"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p>In the early 1960s structural engineer <a href="Fazlur_Khan" title="wikilink">Fazlur Khan</a> realized that the dominating rigid <a href="steel_frame" title="wikilink">steel frame</a> structure was not the only system apt for tall buildings, marking a new era of skyscraper construction in terms of multiple <a href="structural_system" title="wikilink">structural systems</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn38" id="fnref38"><sup>38</sup></a> His central innovation in <a href="skyscraper_design_and_construction" title="wikilink">skyscraper design and construction</a> was the concept of the <a href="Tube_(structure)" title="wikilink">"tube" structural system</a>, including the "framed tube", "trussed tube", and "bundled tube".<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn39" id="fnref39"><sup>39</sup></a> These systems allow greater economic efficiency,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn40" id="fnref40"><sup>40</sup></a> and also allow skyscrapers to take on various shapes, no longer needing to be rectangular and box-shaped.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn41" id="fnref41"><sup>41</sup></a> The first building to employ the tube structure was the <a href="Plaza_on_DeWitt" title="wikilink">Chestnut De-Witt</a> apartment building.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn42" id="fnref42"><sup>42</sup></a> Over the next fifteen years, many towers were built by Khan and the "<a href="Chicago_School_(architecture)" title="wikilink">Second Chicago School</a>",<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn43" id="fnref43"><sup>43</sup></a> including the massive  <a href="Willis_Tower" title="wikilink">Willis Tower</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn44" id="fnref44"><sup>44</sup></a> Other pioneers of this field include <a href="Srinivasa_'Hal'_Iyengar" title="wikilink">Hal Iyengar</a> and <a href="William_LeMessurier" title="wikilink">William LeMessurier</a>.</p>
<p>Chicago, Hong Kong, and New York City, otherwise known as "the big three," are recognized in architectural circles as having especially compelling skylines. A landmark skyscraper can inspire a boom of new high-rise projects in its city, as <a href="Taipei_101" title="wikilink">Taipei 101</a> has done in Taipei since its opening in 2004.</p>

<h2 id="design-and-construction">Design and construction</h2>
<p>The design and construction of skyscrapers involves creating safe, habitable spaces in very tall buildings. The buildings must support their weight, resist wind and earthquakes, and protect occupants from fire. Yet they must also be conveniently accessible, even on the upper floors, and provide utilities and a comfortable climate for the occupants. The problems posed in skyscraper design are considered among the most complex encountered given the balances required between <a class="uri" href="economics" title="wikilink">economics</a>, <a href="Civil_Engineering" title="wikilink">engineering</a>, and <a class="uri" href="construction" title="wikilink">construction</a> management.</p>
<p>One common feature of skyscrapers is having a steel framework from which curtain walls are suspended, rather than load-bearing walls of conventional construction. Most skyscrapers have a steel frame that enables to build taller than load-bearing walls of reinforced concrete. Skyscrapers usually have particularly small surface area of what are conventionally thought of as walls, because the walls are not load-bearing and therefore most skyscrapers are characterized by large surface areas of windows made possible by the concept of steel frame and curtain walls. However, skyscrapers can have curtain walls that mimick conventional walls and a small surface area of windows.</p>
<p>The concept of a skyscraper is a product of the <a href="Industrial_society" title="wikilink">industrialized age</a>, made possible by cheap <a href="fossil_fuel" title="wikilink">fossil fuel</a> derived energy and industrially refined raw materials such as <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> and <a class="uri" href="concrete" title="wikilink">concrete</a>. The construction of skyscrapers was enabled by <a href="steel_frame" title="wikilink">steel frame</a> construction that surpassed <a href="brick_and_mortar" title="wikilink">brick and mortar</a> construction starting at the end of the 19th century and finally surpassing it in the 20th century together with <a href="reinforced_concrete" title="wikilink">reinforced concrete</a> construction as the price of steel decreased and labour costs increased.</p>
<p>The steel frames become inefficient and uneconomic for supertall buildings as usable floor spaces are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn52" id="fnref52"><sup>52</sup></a> Since about 1960, tubular designs have been used for high rises. This reduces the usage of material (more efficient in economic terms - <a href="Willis_Tower" title="wikilink">Willis Tower</a> uses a third less steel than the Empire State Building) yet allows greater height. It allows fewer interior columns, and so creates more usable floor space. It further enables buildings to take on various shapes.</p>
<p><a href="Elevator" title="wikilink">Elevators</a> are characteristic to skyscrapers. In 1852 Elisha Otis introduced the safety elevator, allowing convenient and safe passenger movement to upper floors. Another crucial development was the use of a steel frame instead of stone or brick, otherwise the walls on the lower floors on a tall building would be too thick to be practical. Today major manufacturers of elevators include <a href="Otis_Elevator_Company" title="wikilink">Otis</a>, <a href="ThyssenKrupp_AG" title="wikilink">ThyssenKrupp</a>, <a href="Schindler_Group" title="wikilink">Schindler</a>, and <a class="uri" href="KONE" title="wikilink">KONE</a>.</p>
<h3 id="basic-design-considerations">Basic design considerations</h3>
<p>Good structural design is important in most building design, but particularly for skyscrapers since even a small chance of catastrophic failure is unacceptable given the high price. This presents a paradox to civil engineers: the only way to assure a lack of failure is to test for all modes of failure, in both the laboratory and the real world. But the only way to know of all modes of failure is to learn from previous failures. Thus, no engineer can be absolutely sure that a given structure will resist all loadings that could cause failure, but can only have large enough margins of safety such that a failure is acceptably unlikely. When buildings do fail, engineers question whether the failure was due to some lack of foresight or due to some unknowable factor.</p>
<h3 id="loading-and-vibration">Loading and vibration</h3>
<p>The load a skyscraper experiences is largely from the force of the building material itself. In most building designs, the weight of the structure is much larger than the weight of the material that it will support beyond its own weight. In technical terms, the <a href="dead_load" title="wikilink">dead load</a>, the load of the structure, is larger than the <a href="live_load" title="wikilink">live load</a>, the weight of things in the structure (people, furniture, vehicles, etc.). As such, the amount of structural material required within the lower levels of a skyscraper will be much larger than the material required within higher levels. This is not always visually apparent. The <a href="Empire_State_Building" title="wikilink">Empire State Building's</a> <a href="Setback_(architecture)" title="wikilink">setbacks</a> are actually a result of the building code at the time, and were not structurally required. On the other hand, <a href="John_Hancock_Center" title="wikilink">John Hancock Center's</a> shape is uniquely the result of how it supports loads. Vertical supports can come in several types, among which the most common for skyscrapers can be categorized as steel frames, concrete cores, tube within tube design, and shear walls.</p>
<p>The wind loading on a skyscraper is also considerable. In fact, the lateral wind load imposed on super-tall structures is generally the governing factor in the structural design. Wind pressure increases with height, so for very tall buildings, the loads associated with wind are larger than dead or live loads.</p>
<p>Other vertical and horizontal loading factors come from varied, unpredictable sources, such as earthquakes.</p>
<h3 id="shear-walls">Shear walls</h3>
<p>A shear wall, in its simplest definition, is a wall where the entire material of the wall is employed in the resistance of both horizontal and vertical loads. A typical example is a <a class="uri" href="brick" title="wikilink">brick</a> or <a class="uri" href="cinderblock" title="wikilink">cinderblock</a> wall. Since the wall material is used to hold the weight, as the wall expands in size, it must hold considerably more weight. Due to the features of a shear wall, it is acceptable for small constructions, such as suburban housing or an urban brownstone, to require low material costs and little maintenance. In this way, shear walls, typically in the form of <a class="uri" href="plywood" title="wikilink">plywood</a> and framing, brick, or cinderblock, are used for these structures. For skyscrapers, though, as the size of the structure increases, so does the size of the supporting wall. Large structures such as <a href="castle" title="wikilink">castles</a> and <a href="cathedral" title="wikilink">cathedrals</a> inherently addressed these issues due to a large wall being advantageous (castles), or ingeniously designed around (cathedrals). Since skyscrapers seek to maximize the floor-space by consolidating structural support, shear walls tend to be used only in conjunction with other support systems.</p>
<h3 id="steel-frame">Steel frame</h3>
<p>By 1895, <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> had replaced <a href="cast_iron" title="wikilink">cast iron</a> as skyscrapers' structural material. Its malleability allowed it to be formed into a variety of shapes, and it could be riveted, ensuring strong connections.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn53" id="fnref53"><sup>53</sup></a> The simplicity of a steel frame eliminated the inefficient part of a shear wall, the central portion, and consolidated support members in a much stronger fashion by allowing both horizontal and vertical supports throughout. Among steel's drawbacks is that as more material must be supported as height increases, the distance between supporting members must decrease, which in turn increases the amount of material that must be supported. This becomes inefficient and uneconomic for buildings above 40 stories tall as usable floor spaces are reduced for supporting column and due to more usage of steel.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn54" id="fnref54"><sup>54</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="tube-structural-systems">Tube structural systems</h3>
<p> A new structural system of framed tubes was developed in 1963. <a href="Fazlur_Khan" title="wikilink">Fazlur Khan</a> and J. Rankine defined the framed tube structure as "a three dimensional space structure composed of three, four, or possibly more frames, braced frames, or shear walls, joined at or near their edges to form a vertical tube-like structural system capable of resisting lateral forces in any direction by cantilevering from the foundation."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn55" id="fnref55"><sup>55</sup></a> Closely spaced interconnected exterior columns form the tube. Horizontal loads (primarily wind) are supported by the structure as a whole. Framed tubes allow fewer interior columns, and so create more usable floor space, and about half the exterior surface is available for windows. Where larger openings like garage doors are required, the tube frame must be interrupted, with transfer girders used to maintain structural integrity. Tube structures cut down costs, at the same time allowing buildings to reach greater heights. Concrete tube-frame construction<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn56" id="fnref56"><sup>56</sup></a> was first used in the <a href="DeWitt-Chestnut_Apartment_Building" title="wikilink">DeWitt-Chestnut Apartment Building</a>, completed in <a class="uri" href="Chicago" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> in 1963,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn57" id="fnref57"><sup>57</sup></a> and soon after in the <a href="John_Hancock_Center" title="wikilink">John Hancock Center</a> and <a href="construction_of_the_World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="tube_(structure)" title="wikilink">tubular systems</a> are fundamental to tall building design. Most buildings over 40-stories constructed since the 1960s now use a tube design derived from Khan’s structural engineering principles,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn58" id="fnref58"><sup>58</sup></a><a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn59" id="fnref59"><sup>59</sup></a> examples including the <a href="construction_of_the_World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">construction of the World Trade Center</a>, <a href="Aon_Center_(Chicago)" title="wikilink">Aon Center</a>, <a href="Petronas_Towers" title="wikilink">Petronas Towers</a>, <a href="Jin_Mao_Building" title="wikilink">Jin Mao Building</a>, and most other <a class="uri" href="supertall" title="wikilink">supertall</a> skyscrapers since the 1960s.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn60" id="fnref60"><sup>60</sup></a> The strong influence of tube structure design is also evident in the construction of the current tallest skyscraper, the <a href="Burj_Khalifa" title="wikilink">Burj Khalifa</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn61" id="fnref61"><sup>61</sup></a></p>

<figcaption>Changes of structure with height. The <a href="Tube_(structure)" title="wikilink">tubular systems</a> are fundamental for super tall buildings.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Khan pioneered several other variations of the tube structure design. One of these was the concept of <a class="uri" href="X-bracing" title="wikilink">X-bracing</a>, or the "<a href="Tube_(structure)#Trussed_tube" title="wikilink">trussed tube</a>", first employed for the <a href="John_Hancock_Center" title="wikilink">John Hancock Center</a>. This concept reduced the lateral load on the building by transferring the load into the exterior columns. This allows for a reduced need for interior columns thus creating more floor space. This concept can be seen in the John Hancock Center, designed in 1965 and completed in 1969. One of the most famous buildings of the <a href="Structural_Expressionism" title="wikilink">structural expressionist</a> style, the skyscraper's distinctive X-bracing exterior is actually a hint that the structure's skin is indeed part of its 'tubular system'. This idea is one of the architectural techniques the building used to climb to record heights (the tubular system is essentially the spine that helps the building stand upright during wind and <a href="seismic_loading" title="wikilink">earthquake loads</a>). This X-bracing allows for both higher performance from tall structures and the ability to open up the inside floorplan (and usable floor space) if the architect desires.</p>
<p>The John Hancock Center was far more efficient than earlier <a href="Steel_frame" title="wikilink">steel-frame</a> structures. Where the <a href="Empire_State_Building" title="wikilink">Empire State Building</a> (1931), required about 206 kilograms of steel per square metre and <a href="Chase_Manhattan_Bank_Building" title="wikilink">Chase Manhattan Bank Building</a> (1961) required 275, the John Hancock Center required only 145.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn62" id="fnref62"><sup>62</sup></a> The trussed tube concept was applied to many later skyscrapers, including the <a href="Onterie_Center" title="wikilink">Onterie Center</a>, <a href="Citigroup_Center" title="wikilink">Citigroup Center</a> and <a href="Bank_of_China_Tower,_Hong_Kong" title="wikilink">Bank of China Tower</a>.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn63" id="fnref63"><sup>63</sup></a></p>
<h4 id="bundled-tube">Bundled tube</h4>
<p>An important variation on the tube frame is the "<a href="Tube_(structure)#Bundled_tube" title="wikilink">bundled tube</a>", which uses several interconnected tube frames. The <a href="Willis_Tower" title="wikilink">Willis Tower</a> in Chicago used this design, employing nine tubes of varying height to achieve its distinct appearance. The bundled tube structure meant that "buildings no longer need be boxlike in appearance: they could become sculpture."<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn64" id="fnref64"><sup>64</sup></a></p>
<h3 id="the-elevator-conundrum">The elevator conundrum</h3>
<p>The invention of the <a class="uri" href="elevator" title="wikilink">elevator</a> was a precondition for the invention of skyscrapers, given that most people would not (or could not) climb more than a few flights of stairs at a time. The elevators in a skyscraper are not simply a necessary utility, like running water and electricity, but are in fact closely related to the design of the whole structure: a taller building requires more elevators to service the additional floors, but the elevator shafts consume valuable floor space. If the service core, which contains the elevator shafts, becomes too big, it can reduce the profitability of the building. Architects must therefore balance the value gained by adding height against the value lost to the expanding service core.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn65" id="fnref65"><sup>65</sup></a> Many tall buildings use elevators in a non-standard configuration to reduce their footprint. Buildings such as the former <a href="World_Trade_Center_Towers" title="wikilink">World Trade Center Towers</a> and Chicago's <a href="John_Hancock_Center" title="wikilink">John Hancock Center</a> use <a href="sky_lobby" title="wikilink">sky lobbies</a>, where express elevators take passengers to upper floors which serve as the base for local elevators. This allows architects and engineers to place elevator shafts on top of each other, saving space. Sky lobbies and express elevators take up a significant amount of space, however, and add to the amount of time spent commuting between floors. Other buildings, such as the <a href="Petronas_Towers" title="wikilink">Petronas Towers</a>, use <a href="double-deck_elevator" title="wikilink">double-deck elevators</a>, allowing more people to fit in a single elevator, and reaching two floors at every stop. It is possible to use even more than two levels on an elevator, although this has never been done. The main problem with double-deck elevators is that they cause everyone in the elevator to stop when only people on one level need to get off at a given floor.</p>
<p>Buildings with sky lobbies include the <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a>, <a href="Petronas_Twin_Towers" title="wikilink">Petronas Twin Towers</a> and <a href="Taipei_101" title="wikilink">Taipei 101</a>. The 44th-floor sky lobby of the John Hancock Center also featured the first <a class="uri" href="high-rise" title="wikilink">high-rise</a> indoor <a href="swimming_pool" title="wikilink">swimming pool</a>, which remains the highest in America.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn66" id="fnref66"><sup>66</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="economic-rationale">Economic rationale</h2>
<p>Skyscrapers are usually situated in <a href="city_center" title="wikilink">city centers</a> where the price of land is high. Constructing a skyscraper becomes justified if the price of land is so high that it makes <a href="economics" title="wikilink">economic</a> sense to build upwards as to minimize the cost of the land per the total floor area of a building. Thus the construction of skyscrapers is dictated by economics and results in skyscrapers in a certain part of a large city unless a <a href="building_code" title="wikilink">building code</a> restricts the height of buildings. Skyscrapers are rarely seen in small cities and they are characteristic of large cities, because of the critical importance of high land prices for the construction of skyscrapers. Usually only office, commercial and hotel users can afford the rents in the city center and thus most tenants of skyscrapers are of these classes. Some skyscrapers have been built in areas where the <a class="uri" href="bedrock" title="wikilink">bedrock</a> is near surface, because this makes constructing the <a href="foundation_(engineering)" title="wikilink">foundation</a> cheaper, for example this is the case in <a href="Midtown_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Midtown Manhattan</a> and <a href="Lower_Manhattan" title="wikilink">Lower Manhattan</a>, in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, but not in-between these two parts of the city.</p>
<p>Today, skyscrapers are an increasingly common sight where land is expensive, as in the centers of big cities, because they provide such a high ratio of rentable floor space per unit area of land.</p>
<p><span class="LaTeX">$\text{Simple price of floor area (currency/}\mathrm{m}^2\text{)} = \frac{\text{price of land area (currency)}} {\text{total floor area (}\mathrm{m}^2\text{)}}$</span></p>
<p>One problem with skyscrapers is <a href="Parking_lot" title="wikilink">car parking</a>. In the largest cities most people commute via public transport, but for smaller cities a lot of parking spaces are needed. <a href="Multi-storey_car_park" title="wikilink">Multi-storey car parks</a> are impractical to build very tall, so a lot of land area is needed.</p>
<p>There may be a correlation between skyscraper construction and great <a href="income_inequality" title="wikilink">income inequality</a> but this has not been conclusively proved.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn67" id="fnref67"><sup>67</sup></a></p>
<h2 id="environmental-impact">Environmental impact</h2>

<figcaption><a href="30_St_Mary_Axe" title="wikilink">30 St Mary Axe</a> in London is an example of a modern environmentally friendly skyscraper.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The environmental impact of skyscrapers and whether instead of skyscrapers multiple smaller, lighter buildings would be more environmentally friendly or <a href="sustainability" title="wikilink">sustainable</a> is under debate. The concept of a skyscraper is a product of the <a href="Industrial_society" title="wikilink">industrialized age</a>, made possible by cheap <a href="fossil_fuel" title="wikilink">fossil fuel</a> derived energy and industrially refined raw materials such as <a class="uri" href="steel" title="wikilink">steel</a> and <a class="uri" href="concrete" title="wikilink">concrete</a>. The construction of skyscrapers was enabled by <a href="steel_frame" title="wikilink">steel frame</a> construction that surpassed <a href="brick_and_mortar" title="wikilink">brick and mortar</a> construction starting at the end of the 19th century and finally surpassing it in the 20th century together with <a href="reinforced_concrete" title="wikilink">reinforced concrete</a> construction as the price of steel decreased and labour costs increased.</p>
<p>The amount of steel, concrete and glass needed to construct a single skyscraper is large, and these materials represent a great deal of <a href="embodied_energy" title="wikilink">embodied energy</a>. Skyscrapers are thus energy intensive buildings, but skyscrapers have a long lifespan, for example the <a href="Empire_State_Building" title="wikilink">Empire State Building</a> in <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a>, <a href="United_States" title="wikilink">United States</a> completed in 1931 and is still in active use. Skyscrapers have considerable mass, which means that they must be built on a sturdier foundation than would be required for shorter, lighter buildings. Building materials must also be lifted to the top of a skyscraper during construction, requiring more energy than would be necessary at lower heights. Furthermore, a skyscraper consumes a lot of electricity because <a class="uri" href="potable" title="wikilink">potable</a> and non-potable water have to be pumped to the highest occupied floors, skyscrapers are usually designed to be <a href="HVAC" title="wikilink">mechanically ventilated</a>, elevators are generally used instead of stairs, and natural lighting cannot be utilized in rooms far from the windows and the windowless spaces such as elevators, bathrooms and stairwells.</p>
<p>Skyscrapers can be artificially lighted and the energy requirements can be covered by <a href="renewable_energy" title="wikilink">renewable energy</a> or other electricity generation of low <a href="greenhouse_gas" title="wikilink">greenhouse gas</a> emissions. Heating and cooling of skyscrapers can be efficient, because of centralized <a class="uri" href="HVAC" title="wikilink">HVAC</a> systems, heat radiation blocking <a href="window" title="wikilink">windows</a> and small surface area of the building. There is <a href="Leadership_in_Energy_and_Environmental_Design" title="wikilink">Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design</a> (LEED) certification for skyscrapers. For example the Empire State Building received a gold Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design rating in September 2011 and the Empire State Building is the tallest LEED certified building in the United States, proving that skyscrapers can be environmentally friendly. Also the <a href="30_St_Mary_Axe" title="wikilink">30 St Mary Axe</a> in <a class="uri" href="London" title="wikilink">London</a>, the <a href="United_Kingdom" title="wikilink">United Kingdom</a> is an environmentally friendly skyscraper.</p>
<p>In the lower levels of a skyscraper a larger percentage of the building cross section must be devoted to the building structure and services than is required for lower buildings:</p>
<ul>
<li>More structure – because it must be stronger to support more floors above</li>
<li><a href="Skyscraper_design_and_construction#The_elevator_conundrum" title="wikilink">The elevator conundrum</a> creates the need for more lift shafts—everyone comes in at the bottom and they all have to pass through the lower part of the building to get to the upper levels.</li>
<li><a href="Building_services" title="wikilink">Building services</a>—power and water enter the building from below and have to pass through the lower levels to get to the upper levels.</li>
</ul>
<p>In low-rise structures, the support rooms (<a href="chiller" title="wikilink">chillers</a>, <a href="transformer" title="wikilink">transformers</a>, <a href="boiler" title="wikilink">boilers</a>, <a href="pump" title="wikilink">pumps</a> and <a href="air_handling_unit" title="wikilink">air handling units</a>) can be put in basements or roof space—areas which have low rental value. There is, however, a limit to how far this plant can be located from the area it serves. The farther away it is the larger the risers for ducts and pipes from this plant to the floors they serve and the more floor area these risers take. In practice this means that in highrise buildings this plant is located on 'plant levels' at intervals up the building.</p>
<h2 id="history-of-the-tallest-skyscrapers">History of the tallest skyscrapers</h2>
<p>At the beginning of the 20th century, <a href="New_York_City" title="wikilink">New York City</a> was a center for the <a href="Beaux-Arts_architecture" title="wikilink">Beaux-Arts architectural</a> movement, attracting the talents of such great architects as <a href="Stanford_White" title="wikilink">Stanford White</a> and <a href="Carrere_and_Hastings" title="wikilink">Carrere and Hastings</a>. As better construction and engineering technology became available as the century progressed, New York City and <a class="uri" href="Chicago" title="wikilink">Chicago</a> became the focal point of the competition for the tallest building in the world. Each city's striking skyline has been composed of numerous and varied skyscrapers, many of which are icons of 20th-century architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="Flatiron_Building" title="wikilink">Flatiron Building</a>, designed by <a href="Daniel_Hudson_Burnham" title="wikilink">Daniel Hudson Burnham</a> and standing 285 ft (87 m) high, was one of the tallest buildings in New York City upon its completion in 1902, made possible by its steel skeleton. It was one of the first buildings designed with a steel framework, and to achieve this height with other construction methods of that time would have been very difficult. (The <a href="Tower_Building_(New_York_City)" title="wikilink">Tower Building</a>, designed by <a href="Bradford_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Bradford Gilbert</a> and built in 1889, is considered by some to be New York City's first skyscraper, and may have been the first building in New York City to use a skeletal steel frame,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn68" id="fnref68"><sup>68</sup></a> while the <a href="Home_Insurance_Building" title="wikilink">Home Insurance Building</a> in Chicago, which was built in 1884, is considered the world's first skyscraper due to its steel skeleton).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn69" id="fnref69"><sup>69</sup></a> Subsequent buildings such as the <a href="Singer_Building" title="wikilink">Singer Building</a> and the <a href="Metropolitan_Life_Tower" title="wikilink">Metropolitan Life Tower</a> were higher still.</li>
<li>The <a href="Woolworth_Building" title="wikilink">Woolworth Building</a>, a neo-Gothic "Cathedral of Commerce" overlooking City Hall, was designed by <a href="Cass_Gilbert" title="wikilink">Cass Gilbert</a>. At 792 feet (241 m), it became the world's tallest building upon its completion in 1913, an honor it retained until 1930, when it was overtaken by <a href="40_Wall_Street" title="wikilink">40 Wall Street</a>.</li>
<li>That same year, the <a href="Chrysler_Building" title="wikilink">Chrysler Building</a> took the lead as the tallest building in the world, scraping the sky at 1,046 feet (319 m).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn70" id="fnref70"><sup>70</sup></a> Designed by <a href="William_Van_Alen" title="wikilink">William Van Alen</a>, an <a href="Art_Deco" title="wikilink">Art Deco</a> style masterpiece with an exterior crafted of brick,<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn71" id="fnref71"><sup>71</sup></a> the Chrysler Building continues to be a favorite of New Yorkers to this day.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn72" id="fnref72"><sup>72</sup></a></li>
<li>The <a href="Empire_State_Building" title="wikilink">Empire State Building</a>, the first building to have more than 100 floors (it has 102), was completed the following year. It was designed by <a href="Shreve,_Lamb_and_Harmon" title="wikilink">Shreve, Lamb and Harmon</a> in the contemporary Art Deco style. The tower takes its name from the <a href="List_of_U.S._state_nicknames" title="wikilink">nickname</a> of <a href="New_York_State" title="wikilink">New York State</a>. Upon its completion in 1931 at 1,250 feet (381 m), it took the top spot as tallest building, and towered above all other buildings until 1972. The antenna mast added in 1951 brought pinnacle height to 1,472 feet (449 m), lowered in 1984 to 1,454 feet (443 m).<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn73" id="fnref73"><sup>73</sup></a></li>
<li>The <a href="World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">World Trade Center</a> officially reached full height in 1972, was completed in 1973, and consisted of two tall towers and several smaller buildings. For a short time, the first of the two towers was the world's tallest building. Upon completion, the towers stood for 28 years, until the <a href="September_11_attacks" title="wikilink">September 11 attacks</a> destroyed the buildings in 2001. Various governmental entities, financial firms, and law firms called the towers home.</li>
<li>The <a href="Willis_Tower" title="wikilink">Willis Tower</a> (formerly Sears Tower) was completed in 1974, one year after the World Trade Center, and surpassed it as the world's tallest building. It was the first building to employ the "<a href="Tube_(structure)" title="wikilink">bundled tube</a>" structural system, designed by Fazlur Khan. The building was not surpassed in height until the <a href="Petronas_Towers" title="wikilink">Petronas Towers</a> were constructed in 1998, but remained the tallest in some categories until <a href="Burj_Khalifa" title="wikilink">Burj Khalifa</a> surpassed it in all categories in 2010. It is currently the second tallest building in the United States, after <a href="One_World_Trade_Center" title="wikilink">One World Trade Center</a>, which was built to replace the destroyed towers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Momentum in setting records passed from the United States to other nations with the opening of the <a href="Petronas_Twin_Towers" title="wikilink">Petronas Twin Towers</a> in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in 1998. The record for the world's tallest building has remained in Asia since the opening of <a href="Taipei_101" title="wikilink">Taipei 101</a> in Taipei, Taiwan, in 2004. A number of architectural records, including those of the world's tallest building and tallest free-standing structure, moved to the Middle East with the opening of the <a href="Burj_Khalifa" title="wikilink">Burj Khalifa</a> in Dubai, United Arab Emirates.</p>
<p>This geographical transition is accompanied by a change in approach to skyscraper design. For much of the twentieth century large buildings took the form of simple geometrical shapes. This reflected the "international style" or <a href="Modern_architecture" title="wikilink">modernist</a> philosophy shaped by <a class="uri" href="Bauhaus" title="wikilink">Bauhaus</a> architects early in the century. The last of these, the Willis Tower and World Trade Center towers in New York, erected in the 1970s, reflect the philosophy. Tastes shifted in the decade which followed, and new skyscrapers began to exhibit <a href="Postmodernism" title="wikilink">postmodernist</a> influences. This approach to design avails itself of historical elements, often adapted and re-interpreted, in creating technologically modern structures. The Petronas Twin Towers recall Asian <a class="uri" href="pagoda" title="wikilink">pagoda</a> architecture and Islamic geometric principles. Taipei 101 likewise reflects the <a class="uri" href="pagoda" title="wikilink">pagoda</a> tradition as it incorporates ancient <a href="Motif_(visual_arts)" title="wikilink">motifs</a> such as the <a href="Ruyi_(scepter)" title="wikilink">ruyi</a> symbol. The Burj Khalifa draws inspiration from traditional <a href="Islamic_art" title="wikilink">Islamic art</a>. Architects in recent years have sought to create structures that would not appear equally at home if set in any part of the world, but that reflect the culture thriving in the spot where they stand.</p>
<p>The following list measures height of the roof.<a class="footnoteRef" href="#fn74" id="fnref74"><sup>74</sup></a> The more common gauge is the "highest architectural detail"; such ranking would have included Petronas Towers, built in 1998.</p>
