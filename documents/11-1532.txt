L-Fuculokinase

L-fuculokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

ATP + L-fuculose 
 
 
 
  ADP + L-fuculose-1-phosphate
 

Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and L-fuculose, whereas its two products are ADP and L-fuculose-1-phosphate.1
The gene name used for the gene that encodes L-fuculokinase is fucK.2
L-fuculokinase belongs to the family of transferases, specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups (phosphotransferases) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:L-fuculose 1-phosphotransferase. Other names in common use include L-fuculokinase (phosphorylating), and L-fuculose kinase. This enzyme participates in fructose and mannose metabolism.
