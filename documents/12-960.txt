   Turán sieve      Turán sieve   In number theory , the Turán sieve is a technique for estimating the size of "sifted sets" of positive integers which satisfy a set of conditions which are expressed by congruences . It was developed by Pál Turán in 1934.  Description  In terms of sieve theory the Turán sieve is of combinatorial type : deriving from a rudimentary form of the inclusion-exclusion principle . The result gives an upper bound for the size of the sifted set.  Let A be a set of positive integers ≤ x and let P be a set of primes. For each p in P , let A p denote the set of elements of A divisible by p and extend this to let A d the intersection of the A p for p dividing d , when d is a product of distinct primes from P . Further let A 1 denote A itself. Let z be a positive real number and P ( z ) denote the product of the primes in P which are ≤ z . The object of the sieve is to estimate        S   (  A  ,  P  ,  z  )    =   |   A  ∖    ⋃   p  ∈   P   (  z  )       A  p     |    .        S   A  P  z        A    subscript     p    P  z      subscript  A  p        S(A,P,z)=\left|A\setminus\bigcup_{p\in P(z)}A_{p}\right|.     We assume that | A d | may be estimated, when d is a prime p by       |   A  p   |   =     1   f   (  p  )     X   +   R  p           subscript  A  p          1    f  p    X    subscript  R  p      \left|A_{p}\right|=\frac{1}{f(p)}X+R_{p}     and when d is a product of two distinct primes d = p  q by       |   A   p  q    |   =     1   f   (  p  )   f   (  q  )     X   +   R   p  ,  q            subscript  A    p  q           1    f  p  f  q    X    subscript  R   p  q       \left|A_{pq}\right|=\frac{1}{f(p)f(q)}X+R_{p,q}     where X =   | A | and f is a function with the property that 0 ≤ f ( d ) ≤ 1. Put        U   (  z  )    =    ∑   p  ∣  P   (  z  )      f   (  p  )      .        U  z     subscript    fragments  p  normal-∣  P   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)       f  p      U(z)=\sum_{p\mid P(z)}f(p).     Then        S   (  A  ,  P  ,  z  )    ≤    X   U   (  z  )     +    2   U   (  z  )       ∑   p  ∣  P   (  z  )      |   R  p   |     +    1   U    (  z  )   2       ∑   p  ,  q  ∣  P   (  z  )      |   R   p  ,  q    |       .        S   A  P  z        X    U  z        2    U  z      subscript    fragments  p  normal-∣  P   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)        subscript  R  p          1    U   superscript  z  2       subscript    fragments  p  normal-,  q  normal-∣  P   fragments  normal-(  z  normal-)        subscript  R   p  q          S(A,P,z)\leq\frac{X}{U(z)}+\frac{2}{U(z)}\sum_{p\mid P(z)}\left|R_{p}\right|+%
 \frac{1}{U(z)^{2}}\sum_{p,q\mid P(z)}\left|R_{p,q}\right|.     Applications   The Hardy–Ramanujan theorem that the normal order of ω( n ), the number of distinct prime factors of a number n , is log(log( n ));  Almost all integer polynomials (taken in order of height) are irreducible.
