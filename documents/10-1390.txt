   Hydrogenase (acceptor)      Hydrogenase (acceptor)   In enzymology , a hydrogenase (acceptor) () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   H 2 + A   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   AH 2    Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are H 2 and A, whereas its product is AH 2 .  This enzyme belongs to the family of oxidoreductases , specifically those acting on hydrogen as donor with other acceptors. The systematic name of this enzyme class is hydrogen:acceptor oxidoreductase . Other names in common use include H2 producing hydrogenase[ambiguous] , hydrogen-lyase[ambiguous] , hydrogenlyase[ambiguous] , uptake hydrogenase[ambiguous] , and hydrogen:(acceptor) oxidoreductase .
