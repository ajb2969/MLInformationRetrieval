Property B




Property B

In mathematics, Property B is a certain set theoretic property. Formally, given a finite set X, a collection C of subsets of X, all of size n, has Property B if we can partition X into two disjoint subsets Y and Z such that every set in C meets both Y and Z. The smallest number of sets in a collection of sets of size n such that C does not have Property B is denoted by m(n).
The property gets its name from mathematician Felix Bernstein, who first introduced the property in 1908.
Values of m(n)
It is known that m(1) = 1, m(2) = 3, and m(3) = 7 (as can by seen by the following examples); the value of m(4) is not known, although an upper bound of 23 (Seymour, Toft) and a lower bound of 21 (Manning) have been proven. At the time of this writing (August 2004), there is no OEIS entry for the sequence m(n) yet, due to the lack of terms known.

m(1)
For n = 1, set X = {1}, and C = {{1}}. Then C does not have Property B.
 


m(2)
For n = 2, set X = {1, 2, 3} and C = . Then C does not have Property B, so m(2) ' =  does (set Y = {1} and Z = {2, 3}), so m(2) >= 3.
 


m(3)
For n = 3, set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and C =  (the Steiner triple system S7); C does not have Property B (so m(3) ' will have Property B (so for this particular case, m(3) >= 7). One may check all other collections of 6 3-sets to see that all have Property B.
 


m(4)
Seymour (1974) constructed a hypergraph on 11 vertices with 23 edges without Property B, which shows that m(4) = 20.
 

Asymptotics of m(n)
Erdős (1963) proved that for any collection of fewer than 
 
 
 
  sets of size n, there exists a 2-coloring in which no set is monochromatic. The proof is simple: Consider a random coloring. The probability that an arbitrary set is monochromatic is 
 
 
 
 
 . By a union bound, the probability that there exist a monochromatic set is less than 
 
 
 
 . Therefore, there exists a good coloring.
Erdős (1964) constructed an n-uniform graph with 
 
 
 
  edges which does not have property B, establishing an upper bound. Schmidt (1963) proved that every collection of at most 
 
 
 
  has property B. Erdős and Lovász conjectured that 
 
 
 
 . Beck in 1978 improved the lower bound to 
 
 
 
 
 . In 2000, Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan improved the lower bound to 
 
 
 
 . They used a clever probabilistic algorithm.
