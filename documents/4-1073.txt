   Property B      Property B   In mathematics , Property B is a certain set theoretic property. Formally, given a finite set X , a collection C of subsets of X , all of size n , has Property B if we can partition X into two disjoint subsets Y and Z such that every set in C meets both Y and Z . The smallest number of sets in a collection of sets of size n such that C does not have Property B is denoted by m ( n ).  The property gets its name from mathematician Felix Bernstein , who first introduced the property in 1908.  Values of m ( n )  It is known that m (1) = 1, m (2) = 3, and m (3) = 7 (as can by seen by the following examples); the value of m (4) is not known, although an upper bound of 23 (Seymour, Toft) and a lower bound of 21 (Manning) have been proven. At the time of this writing (August 2004), there is no OEIS entry for the sequence m ( n ) yet, due to the lack of terms known.   m (1)  For n = 1, set X = {1}, and C = {{1}}. Then C does not have Property B.    m (2)  For n = 2, set X = {1, 2, 3} and C = . Then C does not have Property B, so m (2) ' =  does (set Y = {1} and Z = {2, 3}), so m (2) >= 3.    m (3)  For n = 3, set X = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7}, and C =  (the Steiner triple system  S 7 ); C does not have Property B (so m (3) ' will have Property B (so for this particular case, m (3) >= 7). One may check all other collections of 6 3-sets to see that all have Property B.    m (4)  Seymour (1974) constructed a hypergraph on 11 vertices with 23 edges without Property B, which shows that m (4) = 20.   Asymptotics of m ( n )  Erdős (1963) proved that for any collection of fewer than    2   n  -  1      superscript  2    n  1     2^{n-1}   sets of size n , there exists a 2-coloring in which no set is monochromatic. The proof is simple: Consider a random coloring. The probability that an arbitrary set is monochromatic is    2    -  n   +  1      superscript  2      n   1     2^{-n+1}   . By a union bound , the probability that there exist a monochromatic set is less than      2   n  -  1     2    -  n   +  1     =  1         superscript  2    n  1     superscript  2      n   1     1    2^{n-1}2^{-n+1}=1   . Therefore, there exists a good coloring.  Erdős (1964) constructed an n -uniform graph with    O   (    2  n   ⋅   n  2    )       O   normal-⋅   superscript  2  n    superscript  n  2      O(2^{n}\cdot n^{2})   edges which does not have property B, establishing an upper bound. Schmidt (1963) proved that every collection of at most     n  /   (   n  +  4   )    ⋅   2  n      normal-⋅    n    n  4     superscript  2  n     n/(n+4)\cdot 2^{n}   has property B. Erdős and Lovász conjectured that     m   (  n  )    =   θ   (    2  n   ⋅  n   )          m  n     θ   normal-⋅   superscript  2  n   n      m(n)=\theta(2^{n}\cdot n)   . Beck in 1978 improved the lower bound to     m   (  n  )    =   Ω   (    n   1  /  3     2  n    )          m  n     normal-Ω     superscript  n    1  3     superscript  2  n       m(n)=\Omega(n^{1/3}2^{n})   . In 2000, Radhakrishnan and Srinivasan improved the lower bound to     m   (  n  )    =   Ω   (    2  n   ⋅    n  /   log  n      )          m  n     normal-Ω   normal-⋅   superscript  2  n       n    n         m(n)=\Omega(2^{n}\cdot\sqrt{n/\log n})   . They used a clever probabilistic algorithm.  References    .      .   .   .   .   .   .   .    . "  Category:Set families
