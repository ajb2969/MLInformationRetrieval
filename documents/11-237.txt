Propanediol dehydratase




Propanediol dehydratase

In enzymology, a propanediol dehydratase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction

propane-1,2-diol 
 
 
 
  propanal + H2O
 

Hence, this enzyme has one substrate, 1,2-propanediol, and two products, propanal and H2O.
This enzyme belongs to the family of lyases, specifically the hydro-lyases, which cleave carbon-oxygen bonds. The systematic name of this enzyme class is propane-1,2-diol hydro-lyase (propanal-forming). Other names in common use include meso-2,3-butanediol dehydrase, diol dehydratase, DL-1,2-propanediol hydro-lyase, diol dehydrase, adenosylcobalamin-dependent diol dehydratase, propanediol dehydrase, coenzyme B12-dependent diol dehydrase, 1,2-propanediol dehydratase, dioldehydratase, and propane-1,2-diol hydro-lyase. This enzyme participates in glycerolipid metabolism. It employs one cofactor, cobamide.
