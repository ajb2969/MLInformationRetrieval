   Monoidal functor      Monoidal functor   In category theory , monoidal functors are functors between monoidal categories which preserve the monoidal structure. More specifically, a monoidal functor between two monoidal categories consists of a functor between the categories, along with two coherence maps —a natural transformation and a morphism that preserve monoidal multiplication and unit, respectively. Mathematicians require these coherence maps to satisfy additional properties depending on how strictly they want to preserve the monoidal structure; each of these properties gives rise to a slightly different definition of monoidal functors   The coherence maps of lax monoidal functors satisfy no additional properties; they are not necessarily invertible.  The coherence maps of strong monoidal functors are invertible.  The coherence maps of strict monoidal functors are identity maps.   Although we distinguish between these different definitions here, authors may call any one of these simply monoidal functors .  Definition  Let    (  𝒞  ,  ⊗  ,   I  𝒞   )     𝒞  tensor-product   subscript  I  𝒞     (\mathcal{C},\otimes,I_{\mathcal{C}})   and    (  𝒟  ,  ∙  ,   I  𝒟   )     𝒟  normal-∙   subscript  I  𝒟     (\mathcal{D},\bullet,I_{\mathcal{D}})   be monoidal categories. A monoidal functor from   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   to   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   consists of a functor     F  :   𝒞  →  𝒟      normal-:  F   normal-→  𝒞  𝒟     F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}   together with a natural transformation       ϕ   A  ,  B    :      F  A   ∙  F   B   →   F   (   A  ⊗  B   )        normal-:   subscript  ϕ   A  B     normal-→     normal-∙    F  A   F   B     F   tensor-product  A  B       \phi_{A,B}:FA\bullet FB\to F(A\otimes B)   and a morphism      ϕ  :    I  𝒟   →   F   I  𝒞        normal-:  ϕ   normal-→   subscript  I  𝒟     F   subscript  I  𝒞       \phi:I_{\mathcal{D}}\to FI_{\mathcal{C}}   , called the coherence maps or structure morphisms , which are such that for every three objects   A   A   A   ,   B   B   B   and   C   C   C   of   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   the diagrams   ,    and   commute in the category   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   . Above, the various natural transformations denoted using    α  ,  ρ  ,  λ     α  ρ  λ    \alpha,\rho,\lambda   are parts of the monoidal structure on   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   and   𝒟   𝒟   \mathcal{D}   .  Variants   The dual of a monoidal functor is a comonoidal functor ; it is a monoidal functor whose coherence maps are reversed. Comonoidal functors may also be called opmonoidal, colax monoidal, or oplax monoidal functors.    A strong monoidal functor is a monoidal functor whose coherence maps     ϕ   A  ,  B    ,  ϕ      subscript  ϕ   A  B    ϕ    \phi_{A,B},\phi   are invertible.  A strict monoidal functor is a monoidal functor whose coherence maps are identities.  A braided monoidal functor is a monoidal functor between braided monoidal categories such that the following diagram commutes for every pair of objects A , B in   𝒞   𝒞   \mathcal{C}   :        A symmetric monoidal functor is a braided monoidal functor whose domain and codomain are symmetric monoidal categories .   Examples   The underlying functor    U  :    (  𝐀𝐛  ,   ⊗  𝐙   ,  𝐙  )   →   (  𝐒𝐞𝐭  ,  ×  ,   {  *  }   )       normal-:  U   normal-→   𝐀𝐛   subscript  tensor-product  𝐙   𝐙    𝐒𝐞𝐭          U\colon(\mathbf{Ab},\otimes_{\mathbf{Z}},\mathbf{Z})\rightarrow(\mathbf{Set},%
 \times,\{*\})   from the category of abelian groups to the category of sets. In this case, the map     ϕ   A  ,  B    :      U   (  A  )    ×  U    (  B  )    →   U   (   A  ⊗  B   )        normal-:   subscript  ϕ   A  B     normal-→        U  A   U   B     U   tensor-product  A  B       \phi_{A,B}\colon U(A)\times U(B)\to U(A\otimes B)   sends (a, b) to    a  ⊗  b     tensor-product  a  b    a\otimes b   ; the map    ϕ  :    {  *  }   →  ℤ      normal-:  ϕ   normal-→     ℤ     \phi\colon\{*\}\to\mathbb{Z}   sends * to 1.    An important example of a symmetric monoidal functor is the mathematical model of topological quantum field theory , which has been recently developed. Let    𝐁𝐨𝐫𝐝   ⟨   n  -  1   ,  n  ⟩      subscript  𝐁𝐨𝐫𝐝     n  1   n     \mathbf{Bord}_{\langle n-1,n\rangle}   be the category of cobordisms of n-1,n -dimensional manifolds with tensor product given by disjoint union, and unit the empty manifold. A topological quantum field theory in dimension n is a symmetric monoidal functor     F  :    (   𝐁𝐨𝐫𝐝   ⟨   n  -  1   ,  n  ⟩    ,  ⊔  ,  ∅  )   →   (  𝐤𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭  ,   ⊗  k   ,  k  )     .     normal-:  F   normal-→    subscript  𝐁𝐨𝐫𝐝     n  1   n    square-union     𝐤𝐕𝐞𝐜𝐭   subscript  tensor-product  k   k      F\colon(\mathbf{Bord}_{\langle n-1,n\rangle},\sqcup,\emptyset)\rightarrow(%

Monoidal functors and adjunctions  Suppose that a functor    F  :   𝒞  →  𝒟      normal-:  F   normal-→  𝒞  𝒟     F:\mathcal{C}\to\mathcal{D}   is left adjoint to a monoidal     (  G  ,  n  )   :    (  𝒟  ,  ∙  ,   I  𝒟   )   →   (  𝒞  ,  ⊗  ,   I  𝒞   )       normal-:   G  n    normal-→   𝒟  normal-∙   subscript  I  𝒟     𝒞  tensor-product   subscript  I  𝒞       (G,n):(\mathcal{D},\bullet,I_{\mathcal{D}})\to(\mathcal{C},\otimes,I_{\mathcal%
 {C}})   . Then   F   F   F   has a comonoidal structure    (  F  ,  m  )     F  m    (F,m)   induced by    (  G  ,  n  )     G  n    (G,n)   , defined by        m   A  ,  B    =       ε     F  A   ∙  F   B    ∘  F    n    F  A   ,   F  B      ∘  F    (    η  A   ⊗   η  B    )     :    F   (   A  ⊗  B   )    →     F  A   ∙  F   B       normal-:     subscript  m   A  B             subscript  ε     normal-∙    F  A   F   B    F    subscript  n     F  A     F  B      F    tensor-product   subscript  η  A    subscript  η  B       normal-→    F   tensor-product  A  B       normal-∙    F  A   F   B      m_{A,B}=\varepsilon_{FA\bullet FB}\circ Fn_{FA,FB}\circ F(\eta_{A}\otimes\eta_%
 {B}):F(A\otimes B)\to FA\bullet FB   and       m  =     ε   I  𝒟    ∘  F   n    :    F   I  𝒞    →   I  𝒟       normal-:    m       subscript  ε   subscript  I  𝒟    F   n     normal-→    F   subscript  I  𝒞     subscript  I  𝒟      m=\varepsilon_{I_{\mathcal{D}}}\circ Fn:FI_{\mathcal{C}}\to I_{\mathcal{D}}   .  If the induced structure on   F   F   F   is strong, then the unit and counit of the adjunction are monoidal natural transformations , and the adjunction is said to be a monoidal adjunction ; conversely, the left adjoint of a monoidal adjunction is always a strong monoidal functor.  Similarly, a right adjoint to a comonoidal functor is monoidal, and the right adjoint of a comonoidal adjunction is a strong monoidal functor.
