   Semi-orthogonal matrix      Semi-orthogonal matrix   In linear algebra , a semi-orthogonal matrix is a non-square matrix with real entries where: if the number of columns exceeds the number of rows, then the rows are orthonormal vectors; but if the number of rows exceeds the number of columns, then the columns are orthonormal vectors.  Equivalently, a non-square matrix A is semi-orthogonal if either         A  T   A   =   I  or  A   A  T    =  I   .           superscript  A  T   A     I  or  A   superscript  A  T         I     A^{T}A=I\text{ or }AA^{T}=I.\,    1  In the following, consider the case where A is an m × n matrix for m > n . Then         A  T   A   =   I  n    ,         superscript  A  T   A    subscript  I  n     A^{T}A=I_{n},\,   which implies the isometry property        ∥   A  x   ∥   2   =     ∥  x  ∥   2         subscript   norm    A  x    2    subscript   norm  x   2     \|Ax\|_{2}=\|x\|_{2}\,   for all x in R n . For example,    [     1      0     ]      1    0     \begin{bmatrix}1\\
 0\end{bmatrix}   is a semi-orthogonal matrix.  A semi-orthogonal matrix A is semi-unitary (either A † A = I or AA † = I ) and either left-invertible or right-invertible (left-invertible if it has more rows than columns, otherwise right invertible). As a linear transformation applied from the left, a semi-orthogonal matrix with more rows than columns preserves the dot product of vectors, and therefore acts as an isometry of Euclidean space, such as a rotation or reflection.
