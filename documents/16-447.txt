It is constructed by a rectification of a tesseractic honeycomb which creates new vertices on the middle of all the original edges, rectifying the cells into rectified tesseracts, and adding new 16-cell facets at the original vertices. Its vertex figure is an octahedral prism, {3,4}×{}.
It is also called a quarter tesseractic honeycomb since it has half the vertices of the 4-demicubic honeycomb, and a quarter of the vertices of a tesseractic honeycomb.1
