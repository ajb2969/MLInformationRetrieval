   Yukawa potential      Yukawa potential   In particle and atomic physics , a Yukawa potential (also called a screened Coulomb potential ) is a potential of the form         V  Yukawa    (  r  )    =   -    g  2     e   -   k  m  r     r      ,         subscript  V  Yukawa   r        superscript  g  2      superscript  e      k  m  r     r       V_{\text{Yukawa}}(r)=-g^{2}\frac{e^{-kmr}}{r},     where g is a magnitude scaling constant, i.e. is the amplitude of potential, m is the mass of the affected particle, r is the radial distance to the particle, and k is another scaling constant, which finally the product of km is the inverse scope. The potential is monotone increasing , implying that the force is always attractive.  The Coulomb potential of electromagnetism is an example of a Yukawa potential with e − kmr equal to 1 everywhere; this is taken to mean that the photon mass m is equal to 0.  In interactions between a meson field and a fermion field, the constant g is equal to the coupling constant between those fields. In the case of the nuclear force , the fermions would be a proton and another proton or a neutron .  History  Hideki Yukawa showed in the 1930s that such a potential arises from the exchange of a massive scalar field such as the field of the pion whose mass is   m   m   m   . Since the field mediator is massive the corresponding force has a certain range, which is inversely proportional to the mass. 1  Relation to Coulomb potential    If the mass is zero (i.e., m=0), then the Yukawa potential equals a Coulomb potential, and the range is said to be infinite. In fact, we have:      m  =  0  ⇒   e   -   m  r     =   e  0   =  1.        m  0    normal-⇒     superscript  e      m  r           superscript  e  0        1.     m=0\Rightarrow e^{-mr}=e^{0}=1.   Consequently, the equation        V  Yukawa    (  r  )    =   -     g  2      e   -   m  r     r            subscript  V  Yukawa   r        superscript  g  2      superscript  e      m  r     r       V_{\text{Yukawa}}(r)=-g^{2}\;\frac{e^{-mr}}{r}   simplifies to the form of the Coulomb potential         V  Coulomb    (  r  )    =   -     g  2     1  r      .         subscript  V  Coulomb   r        superscript  g  2     1  r       V_{\text{Coulomb}}(r)=-g^{2}\;\frac{1}{r}.     A comparison of the long range potential strength for Yukawa and Coulomb is shown in Figure 2. It can be seen that the Coulomb potential has effect over a greater distance whereas the Yukawa potential approaches zero rather quickly. However, any Yukawa potential or Coulomb potential are non-zero for any large r.  Fourier transform  The easiest way to understand that the Yukawa potential is associated with a massive field is by examining its Fourier transform . One has       V   (  𝐫  )    =     -   g  2      (   2  π   )   3     ∫    e    i  𝐤   ⋅  𝐫       4  π     k  2   +   m  2       d  3   k           V  𝐫          superscript  g  2     superscript    2  π   3         superscript  e   normal-⋅    i  𝐤   𝐫        4  π      superscript  k  2    superscript  m  2      superscript  d  3   k       V(\mathbf{r})=\frac{-g^{2}}{(2\pi)^{3}}\int e^{i\mathbf{k\cdot r}}\frac{4\pi}{%
 k^{2}+m^{2}}\;d^{3}k     where the integral is performed over all possible values of the 3-vector momentum k . In this form, the fraction     4  π   /   (    k  2   +   m  2    )         4  π      superscript  k  2    superscript  m  2      4\pi/(k^{2}+m^{2})   is seen to be the propagator or Green's function of the Klein–Gordon equation .  Feynman amplitude  The Yukawa potential can be derived as the lowest order amplitude of the interaction of a pair of fermions. The Yukawa interaction couples the fermion field    ψ   (  x  )       ψ  x    \psi(x)   to the meson field    ϕ   (  x  )       ϕ  x    \phi(x)   with the coupling term         ℒ  int    (  x  )    =   g   ψ  ¯    (  x  )   ϕ   (  x  )   ψ   (  x  )     .         subscript  ℒ  int   x     g   normal-¯  ψ   x  ϕ  x  ψ  x     \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{int}}(x)=g\overline{\psi}(x)\phi(x)\psi(x).     The scattering amplitude for two fermions, one with initial momentum    p  1     subscript  p  1    p_{1}   and the other with momentum    p  2     subscript  p  2    p_{2}   , exchanging a meson with momentum k , is given by the Feynman diagram on the right.  The Feynman rules for each vertex associate a factor of g with the amplitude; since this diagram has two vertices, the total amplitude will have a factor of    g  2     superscript  g  2    g^{2}   . The line in the middle, connecting the two fermion lines, represents the exchange of a meson. The Feynman rule for a particle exchange is to use the propagator; the propagator for a massive meson is    -    4  π   /   (    k  2   +   m  2    )            4  π      superscript  k  2    superscript  m  2       -4\pi/(k^{2}+m^{2})   . Thus, we see that the Feynman amplitude for this graph is nothing more than        V   (  𝐤  )    =   -    g  2     4  π     k  2   +   m  2        .        V  𝐤        superscript  g  2       4  π      superscript  k  2    superscript  m  2         V(\mathbf{k})=-g^{2}\frac{4\pi}{k^{2}+m^{2}}.     From the previous section, this is seen to be the Fourier transform of the Yukawa potential.  See also   Yukawa interaction  Screened Poisson equation   References  Citations  Texts   H.
