List of box office bombs

If a film released in theatres fails to break even at the box office by a large amount, it is considered a box office bomb or box office flop, thus losing money for the distributor, studio and production company that invested in it. Unless officially acknowledged by studios, figures of losses are usually rough estimates at best. This is mostly due to Hollywood accounting practices that typically manipulate profits or keep information on costs a secret in order to avoid profit-sharing agreements.
In some cases, the production studio can make profits from a box office bomb when ancillary revenues are taken into account, such as home media sales and rentals, television broadcast rights, licensing rights, or from selling distribution rights and covering costs before it is released, so a box office bomb can still break even after its theatrical run. This list includes a chart of films that failed to recover their production costs on their theatrical run from worldwide box office revenue, ranked by the nominal value of their losses.
Because studios rarely release official distribution, prints, and advertising costs for most films, costs are limited to production budgets. The losses presented in this list are very approximate.
Estimating loss
Production outfits do not retain all of the box office revenue their films generate, and their share—which can often be variable throughout a film's run—largely depends on their deals with distributors and exhibitors as well as the various taxes that are imposed. For example, the tax filings for Cinemark Theatres in 2010 showed that 54.5 percent of the box office revenues were paid to distributors. Earnings from outside of the US and Canada are even harder to gauge because of various cost factors, like the "dollar fluctuating against foreign currencies" and tariffs. Because of this, it is not possible to calculate exactly how much a film has earned for its backers, but industry analysts regularly apply the rule of thumb that film studios take half of the box office receipts, with theaters taking the other half; thus, a film would normally need to make twice its production budget worldwide to break even.1234
In keeping with industry analyses, losses are calculated by subtracting the production budget from half of the theatrical box office revenues:



where TWG is the total worldwide box office gross and PB is the production budget.
Biggest box office bombs
With a worldwide box-office gross of around $151 million on a production budget of $225 million, 47 Ronin is estimated to be the biggest box office bomb based on absolute loss on worldwide gross. However, such claims usually refer to losses when only taking into account theatrical revenue and production budget. It is not immediately clear which film loses the most when home video and television income, which can form a significant portion of a film's earnings, and the prints and advertising budget, which can inflate a film's overall cost, are factored in. For instance, in addition to the $225–250 million spent on producing The Lone Ranger, it was estimated that Disney spent a further $150 million on worldwide marketing,5 causing Disney to ultimately take a $160–190 million write-off on the film.6 The cost of Sahara also spiraled out of control: Los Angeles Times provided an extensive special report about the film's financial troubles two years after its release, which included a net loss of $78 million through 2006.7
Sometimes a film can be financed by selling its distribution rights to cover costs before production begins. C2 Pictures made deals with Warner Bros., Sony Pictures, and Toho-Towa to release Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines in their respective territories in return for $149 million, with another $11 million earned by transferring the copyright to German tax shelters. The final budget was estimated to be $187.3 million, so at least 85% of costs had been covered for the producers before any box office revenue came in.8
Only the revenues from theatrical exhibition and production budgets at their nominal value are included here, which sees 47 Ronin rank in the top position. Up to nine films in total have lost in excess of $100 million. The films on this chart have all had a theatrical run since 1995, and films that have not played since then do not appear on the chart due to ticket-price inflation, population size, and ticket purchasing trends not being considered. The most represented years are 1999, 2001, and 2005, all with five films.
