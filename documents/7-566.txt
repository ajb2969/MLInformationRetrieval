   Tube lemma      Tube lemma   In mathematics , particularly topology , the tube lemma is a useful tool in order to prove that the finite product of compact spaces is compact. It is in general, a concept of point-set topology .  Before giving the lemma, one notes the following terminology:   If X and Y are topological spaces and X × Y is the product space, a slice in X × Y is a set of the form { x } × Y for x ∈ X    A tube in X × Y is just a basis element , K × Y , in X × Y containing a slice in X × Y   Tube Lemma: Let X and Y be topological spaces with Y compact, and consider the product space  X × Y . If N is an open set containing a slice in X × Y , then there exists a tube in X × Y containing this slice and contained in N .  Using the concept of closed maps , this can be rephrased concisely as follows: if X is any topological space and Y a compact space, then the projection map X × Y → X is closed.  Generalized Tube Lemma: Let X and Y be topological spaces and consider the product space X × Y . Let A be a compact subset of X and B be a compact subset of Y . If N is an open set containing A × B , then there exists U open in X and V open in Y such that     A  ×  B   ⊂   U  ×  V   ⊂  N          A  B     U  V        N     A\times B\subset U\times V\subset N   .  Examples and properties  1. Consider R × R in the product topology, that is the Euclidean plane , and the open set N = { ( x , y ) : | x · y | a } be an open cover of X × Y ; for each x belonging to X , cover the slice { x } × Y by finitely many elements of { G a } (this is possible since { x } × Y is compact being homeomorphic to Y ). Call the union of these finitely many elements N x . By the tube lemma, there is an open set of the form W x × Y containing { x } × Y and contained in N x . The collection of all W x for x belonging to X is an open cover of X and hence has a finite subcover W x 1 ∪ ... ∪ W x n . Then for each x i , W x i × Y is contained in N x i . Using the fact that each N x i is the finite union of elements of G a and that the finite collection ( W x 1 × Y ) ∪ ... ∪ ( W x n × Y ) covers X × Y , the collection N x 1 ∪ ... ∪ N x n is a finite subcover of X × Y .  3. By example 2 and induction, one can show that the finite product of compact spaces is compact.  4. The tube lemma cannot be used to prove the Tychonoff theorem , which generalizes the above to infinite products.  Proof  The tube lemma follows from the generalized tube lemma by taking    A  =   {  x  }       A   x     A=\{x\}   and    B  =  Y      B  Y    B=Y   . It therefore suffices to prove the generalized tube lemma. By the definition of the product topology, for each     (  a  ,  b  )   ∈   A  ×  B        a  b     A  B     (a,b)\in A\times B   there are open sets     U   a  ,  b    ⊂  X       subscript  U   a  b    X    U_{a,b}\subset X   and     V   a  ,  b    ⊂  Y       subscript  V   a  b    Y    V_{a,b}\subset Y   such that     (  a  ,  b  )   ∈    U   a  ,  b    ×   V   a  ,  b     ⊂  N         a  b      subscript  U   a  b     subscript  V   a  b          N     (a,b)\in U_{a,b}\times V_{a,b}\subset N   . Fix some    a  ∈  A      a  A    a\in A   . Then    (    V   a  ,  b    :   b  ∈  B    )     normal-:   subscript  V   a  b      b  B     (V_{a,b}:b\in B)   is an open cover of   B   B   B   . Since   B   B   B   is compact, this cover has a finite subcover; namely, there is a finite      B  0    (  a  )    ⊂  B         subscript  B  0   a   B    B_{0}(a)\subset B   such that     V  a  ′   :=    ⋃   b  ∈    B  0    (  a  )       V   a  ,  b     ⊃  B       assign   subscript   superscript  V  normal-′   a     subscript     b     subscript  B  0   a      subscript  V   a  b       superset-of    B     V^{\prime}_{a}:=\bigcup_{b\in B_{0}(a)}V_{a,b}\supset B   . Set     U  a  ′   :=    ⋂   b  ∈    B  0    (  a  )       U   a  ,  b        assign   subscript   superscript  U  normal-′   a     subscript     b     subscript  B  0   a      subscript  U   a  b       U^{\prime}_{a}:=\bigcap_{b\in B_{0}(a)}U_{a,b}   . Since     B  0    (  a  )        subscript  B  0   a    B_{0}(a)   is finite,    U  a  ′     subscript   superscript  U  normal-′   a    U^{\prime}_{a}   is open. Also    V  a  ′     subscript   superscript  V  normal-′   a    V^{\prime}_{a}   is open. Moreover, the construction of    U  a  ′     subscript   superscript  U  normal-′   a    U^{\prime}_{a}   and    V  a  ′     subscript   superscript  V  normal-′   a    V^{\prime}_{a}   implies that      {  a  }   ×  B   ⊂    U  a  ′   ×   V  a  ′    ⊂  N           a   B      subscript   superscript  U  normal-′   a    subscript   superscript  V  normal-′   a         N     \{a\}\times B\subset U^{\prime}_{a}\times V^{\prime}_{a}\subset N   . We now essentially repeat the argument to drop the dependence on   a   a   a   . Let     A  0   ⊂  A       subscript  A  0   A    A_{0}\subset A   be a finite subset such that     U  ′′   :=    ⋃   a  ∈   A  0      U  a  ′    ⊃  A       assign   superscript  U  ′′     subscript     a   subscript  A  0      subscript   superscript  U  normal-′   a      superset-of    A     U^{\prime\prime}:=\bigcup_{a\in A_{0}}U^{\prime}_{a}\supset A   and set     V  ′′   :=    ⋂   a  ∈   A  0      V  a  ′       assign   superscript  V  ′′     subscript     a   subscript  A  0      subscript   superscript  V  normal-′   a      V^{\prime\prime}:=\bigcap_{a\in A_{0}}V^{\prime}_{a}   . It then follows by the above reasoning that     A  ×  B   ⊂    U  ′′   ×   V  ′′    ⊂  N          A  B      superscript  U  ′′    superscript  V  ′′         N     A\times B\subset U^{\prime\prime}\times V^{\prime\prime}\subset N   and     U  ′′   ⊂  X       superscript  U  ′′   X    U^{\prime\prime}\subset X   and     V  ′′   ⊂  Y       superscript  V  ′′   Y    V^{\prime\prime}\subset Y   are open, which completes the proof.
