   Double exponential moving average      Double exponential moving average   The Double Exponential Moving Average (DEMA) indicator was introduced in January 1994 by Patrick G. Mulloy, in an article in the " Technical Analysis of Stocks & Commodities " magazine: "Smoothing Data with Faster Moving Averages" 1 2  It attempts to remove the inherent lag associated to Moving Averages by placing more weight on recent values. The name suggests this is achieved by applying a double exponential smoothing which is not the case. The name double comes from the fact that the value of an EMA ( Exponential Moving Average ) is doubled. To keep it in line with the actual data and to remove the lag the value " EMA of EMA " is subtracted from the previously doubled ema.  The formula is: 3 4 5      ùê∑ùê∏ùëÄùê¥  =     2  *  E   M  A   -   E  M  A   (   E  M  A   )         DEMA        2  E   M  A     E  M  A    E  M  A       \textit{DEMA}={2*EMA-EMA(EMA)}     Because EMA(EMA) is used in the calculation, DEMA needs 2 * period -1 samples to start producing values in contrast to the period samples needed by a regular EMA  The same article also introduced another EMA related indicator: Triple exponential moving average (TEMA)  References  External links  "  Category:Technical indicators
