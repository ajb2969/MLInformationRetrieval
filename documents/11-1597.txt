   Ribokinase      Ribokinase   In enzymology , a ribokinase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   ATP + D-ribose   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   ADP + D-ribose 5-phosphate   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are ATP and D-ribose , whereas its two products are ADP and D-ribose 5-phosphate .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring phosphorus-containing groups ( phosphotransferases ) with an alcohol group as acceptor. The systematic name of this enzyme class is ATP:D-ribose 5-phosphotransferase . Other names in common use include deoxyribokinase , ribokinase (phosphorylating) , and D-ribokinase . This enzyme participates in pentose phosphate pathway .  Structural studies  As of late 2007, 7 structures have been solved for this class of enzymes, with PDB accession codes , , , , , , and .
