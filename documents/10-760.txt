   Cycloartenol 24-C-methyltransferase      Cycloartenol 24-C-methyltransferase   In enzymology , a cycloartenol 24-C-methyltransferase () is an enzyme that catalyzes the chemical reaction   S-adenosyl-L-methionine + cycloartenol   ⇌   normal-⇌   \rightleftharpoons   S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine + (24R)-24-methylcycloart-25-en-3beta-ol   Thus, the two substrates of this enzyme are S-adenosyl methionine and cycloartenol , whereas its two products are S-adenosylhomocysteine and (24R)-24-methylcycloart-25-en-3beta-ol .  This enzyme belongs to the family of transferases , specifically those transferring one-carbon group methyltransferases. The systematic name of this enzyme class is S-adenosyl-L-methionine:cycloartenol 24-C-methyltransferase . This enzyme is also called sterol C-methyltransferase .
